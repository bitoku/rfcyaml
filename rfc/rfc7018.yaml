  - "1.  Introduction\n   IPsec [RFC4301] is used in several different cases, including\n\
    \   tunnel-mode site-to-site VPNs and remote access VPNs.  Both tunneling\n  \
    \ modes for IPsec gateways and host-to-host transport mode are\n   supported in\
    \ this document.\n   The subject of this document is the problem presented by\
    \ large-scale\n   deployments of IPsec and the requirements on a solution to address\n\
    \   the problem.  These may be a large collection of VPN gateways\n   connecting\
    \ various sites, a large number of remote endpoints\n   connecting to a number\
    \ of gateways or to each other, or a mix of the\n   two.  The gateways and endpoints\
    \ may belong to a single\n   administrative domain or several domains with a trust\
    \ relationship.\n   Section 4.4 of RFC 4301 describes the major IPsec databases\
    \ needed\n   for IPsec processing.  It requires extensive configuration for each\n\
    \   tunnel, so manually configuring a system of many gateways and\n   endpoints\
    \ becomes infeasible and inflexible.\n   The difficulty is that a lot of configuration\
    \ mentioned in RFC 4301\n   is required to set up a Security Association.  The\
    \ Internet Key\n   Exchange Protocol (IKE) implementations need to know the identity\
    \ and\n   credentials of all possible peer systems, as well as the addresses of\n\
    \   hosts and/or networks behind them.  A simplified mechanism for\n   dynamically\
    \ establishing point-to-point tunnels is needed.  Section 2\n   contains several\
    \ use cases that motivate this effort.\n"

  contents:
  - "1.1.  Terminology\n   Auto-Discovery Virtual Private Network (ADVPN) -  A VPN\
    \ solution that\n      enables a large number of systems to communicate directly,\
    \ with\n      minimal configuration and operator intervention, using IPsec to\n\
    \      protect communication between them.\n   Endpoint -  A device that implements\
    \ IPsec for its own traffic but\n      does not act as a gateway.\n   Gateway\
    \ -  A network device that implements IPsec to protect traffic\n      flowing\
    \ through the device.\n   Point-to-Point -  Communication between two parties\
    \ without active\n      participation (e.g., encryption or decryption) by any\
    \ other\n      parties.\n   Hub -  The central point in a star topology/dynamic\
    \ full-mesh\n      topology, or one of the central points in the full-mesh style\
    \ VPN,\n      i.e., a gateway to which multiple other hubs or spokes connect.\n\
    \      The hubs usually forward traffic coming from encrypted links to\n     \
    \ other encrypted links, i.e., there are no devices connected to\n      them in\
    \ the clear.\n   Spoke -  The endpoint in a star topology/dynamic full-mesh topology\n\
    \      or gateway that forwards traffic from multiple cleartext devices\n    \
    \  to other hubs or spokes, and some of those other devices are\n      connected\
    \ to it in the clear (i.e., it encrypts data coming from\n      cleartext devices\
    \ and forwards it to the ADVPN).\n   ADVPN Peer -  Any member of an ADVPN, including\
    \ gateways, endpoints,\n      hubs, or spokes.\n   Star Topology -  Topology in\
    \ which there is direct connectivity only\n      between the hub and spoke, and\
    \ where communication between the 2\n      spokes happens through the hub.\n \
    \  Allied and Federated Environments -  Environments where we have\n      multiple\
    \ different organizations that have close associations and\n      need to connect\
    \ to each other.\n   Full-Mesh Topology -  Topology in which there is direct connectivity\n\
    \      between every spoke to every other spoke, without the traffic\n      between\
    \ the spokes having to be redirected through an intermediate\n      hub device.\n\
    \   Dynamic Full-Mesh Topology -  Topology in which direct connections\n     \
    \ exist in a hub-and-spoke manner but dynamic connections are\n      created/removed\
    \ between the spokes on an as-needed basis.\n   Security Association (SA) -  Defined\
    \ in [RFC4301].\n"

- title: '2.1.  Use Case 1: Endpoint-to-Endpoint VPN'
  contents:
  - "2.1.  Use Case 1: Endpoint-to-Endpoint VPN\n   Two endpoints wish to communicate\
    \ securely via a point-to-point SA.\n   The need for secure endpoint-to-endpoint\
    \ communications is often\n   driven by a need to employ high-bandwidth, low-latency\
    \ local\n   connectivity instead of using slow, expensive links to remote\n  \
    \ gateways.  For example, two users in close proximity may wish to\n   place a\
    \ direct, secure video or voice call without needing to send\n   the call through\
    \ remote gateways, as the remote gateways would add\n   latency to the call, consume\
    \ precious remote bandwidth, and increase\n   overall costs.  Such a use case\
    \ also enables connectivity when both\n   users are behind NAT gateways.  Such\
    \ a use case ought to allow for\n   seamless connectivity even as endpoints roam\
    \ and even if they are\n   moving out from behind a NAT gateway, from behind one\
    \ NAT gateway to\n   behind another, or from a standalone position to behind a\
    \ NAT\n   gateway.\n   In a star topology, when two endpoints communicate, they\
    \ need a\n   mechanism for authentication such that they do not expose themselves\n\
    \   to impersonation by the other spoke endpoint.\n"
- title: '2.2.  Use Case 2: Gateway-to-Gateway VPN'
  contents:
  - "2.2.  Use Case 2: Gateway-to-Gateway VPN\n   A typical Enterprise traffic model\
    \ follows a star topology, with the\n   gateways connecting to each other using\
    \ IPsec tunnels.\n   However, for voice and other rich media traffic that require\
    \ a lot of\n   bandwidth or is performance sensitive, the traffic tromboning (taking\n\
    \   a suboptimal path) to the hub can create traffic bottlenecks on the\n   hub\
    \ and can lead to an increase in cost.  A fully meshed solution\n   would make\
    \ best use of the available network capacity and\n   performance, but the deployment\
    \ of a fully meshed solution involves\n   considerable configuration, especially\
    \ when a large number of nodes\n   are involved.  It is for this purpose that\
    \ spoke-to-spoke tunnels are\n   dynamically created and torn down.  For the reasons\
    \ of cost and\n   manual error reduction, it is desired that there be minimal\n\
    \   configuration on each gateway.\n   The solution ought to work in cases where\
    \ the endpoints are in\n   different administrative domains that have an existing\
    \ trust\n   relationship (for example, two organizations that are collaborating\n\
    \   on a project may wish to join their networks while retaining\n   independent\
    \ control over configuration).  It is highly desirable that\n   the solution works\
    \ for the star, full-mesh, and dynamic full-mesh\n   topologies.\n   The solution\
    \ ought to also address the case where gateways use\n   dynamic IP addresses.\n\
    \   Additionally, the routing implications of gateway-to-gateway\n   communication\
    \ need to be addressed.  In the simple case, selectors\n   provide sufficient\
    \ information for a gateway to forward traffic\n   appropriately.  In other cases,\
    \ additional tunneling (e.g., Generic\n   Routing Encapsulation (GRE)) and routing\
    \ (e.g., Open Shortest Path\n   First (OSPF)) protocols are run over IPsec tunnels,\
    \ and the\n   configuration impact on those protocols needs to be considered.\n\
    \   There is also the case where Layer 3 Virtual Private Networks\n   (L3VPNs)\
    \ operate over IPsec tunnels.\n   When two gateways communicate, they need to\
    \ use a mechanism for\n   authentication such that they do not expose themselves\
    \ to the risk of\n   impersonation by the other entities.\n"

  contents:
  - "2.3.  Use Case 3: Endpoint-to-Gateway VPN\n   A mobile endpoint ought to be able\
    \ to use the most efficient gateway\n   as it roams in the Internet.\n   A mobile\
    \ user roaming on the Internet may connect to a gateway that,\n   because of roaming,\
    \ is no longer the most efficient gateway to use\n   (reasons could be cost, efficiency,\
    \ latency, or some other factor).\n   The mobile user ought to be able to discover\
    \ and then connect to the\n   current, most efficient gateway in a seamless way\
    \ without having to\n   bring down the connection.\n"

  contents:
  - "3.  Inadequacy of Existing Solutions\n   Several solutions exist for the problems\
    \ described above.  However,\n   none of these solutions is adequate, as described\
    \ here.\n"
- title: 3.1.  Exhaustive Configuration
  contents:
  - "3.1.  Exhaustive Configuration\n   One simple solution is to configure all gateways\
    \ and endpoints in\n   advance with all the information needed to determine which\
    \ gateway or\n   endpoint is optimal and to establish an SA with that gateway\
    \ or\n   endpoint.  However, this solution does not scale in a large network\n\
    \   with hundreds of thousands of gateways and endpoints, especially when\n  \
    \ multiple administrative domains are involved and things are rapidly\n   changing\
    \ (e.g., mobile endpoints).  Such a solution is also limited\n   by the smallest\
    \ endpoint/gateway, as the same exhaustive\n   configuration is to be applied\
    \ on all endpoints/gateways.  A more\n   dynamic, secure, and scalable system\
    \ for establishing SAs between\n   gateways is needed.\n"
- title: 3.2.  Star Topology
  contents:
  - "3.2.  Star Topology\n   The most common way to address a part of this problem\
    \ today is to use\n   what has been termed a \"star topology\".  In this case,\
    \ one or a few\n   gateways are defined as \"hub gateways\", while the rest of\
    \ the systems\n   (whether endpoints or gateways) are defined as \"spokes\". \
    \ The spokes\n   never connect to other spokes.  They only open tunnels with the\
    \ hub\n   gateways.  Also, for a large number of gateways in one administrative\n\
    \   domain, one gateway may be defined as the hub, and the rest of the\n   gateways\
    \ and remote access clients connect only to that gateway.\n   This solution, however,\
    \ is complicated by the case where the spokes\n   use dynamic IP addresses and\
    \ DNS with dynamic updates needs to be\n   used.  It is also desired that there\
    \ is minimal to no configuration\n   on the hub as the number of spokes increases\
    \ and new spokes are added\n   and deleted randomly.\n   Another problem with\
    \ the star topology is that it creates a high load\n   on the hub gateways, as\
    \ well as on the connection between the spokes\n   and the hub.  This load impacts\
    \ both processing power and network\n   bandwidth.  A single packet in the hub-and-spoke\
    \ scenario can be\n   encrypted and decrypted multiple times.  It would be much\
    \ preferable\n   if these gateways and clients could initiate tunnels between\
    \ them,\n   bypassing the hub gateways.  Additionally, the path bandwidth to\n\
    \   these hub gateways may be lower than that of the path between the\n   spokes.\
    \  For example, two remote access users may be in the same\n   building with high-speed\
    \ WiFi (for example, at an IETF meeting).\n   Channeling their conversation through\
    \ the hub gateways of their\n   respective employers seems extremely wasteful,\
    \ given that a more\n   optimal direct path exists.\n   The challenge is to build\
    \ large-scale IPsec-protected networks that\n   can dynamically change with minimal\
    \ administrative overhead.\n"
- title: 3.3.  Proprietary Approaches
  contents:
  - "3.3.  Proprietary Approaches\n   Several vendors offer proprietary solutions\
    \ to these problems.\n   However, these solutions offer no interoperability between\
    \ equipment\n   from one vendor and another.  This means that they are generally\n\
    \   restricted to use within one organization, and it is harder to move\n   away\
    \ from such solutions, as the features are not standardized.\n   Besides, multiple\
    \ organizations cannot be expected to all choose the\n   same equipment vendor.\n"

    \ will be\n   based.\n"
- title: 4.1.  Gateway and Endpoint Requirements
  contents:
  - "4.1.  Gateway and Endpoint Requirements\n   1.   For any network topology (star,\
    \ full mesh, and dynamic full\n        mesh), when a new gateway or endpoint is\
    \ added, removed, or\n        changed, configuration changes are minimized as\
    \ follows.  Adding\n        or removing a spoke in the topology MUST NOT require\n\
    \        configuration changes to hubs other than where the spoke was\n      \
    \  connected and SHOULD NOT require configuration changes to the\n        hub\
    \ to which the spoke was connected.  The changes also MUST NOT\n        require\
    \ configuration changes in other spokes.\n        Specifically, when evaluating\
    \ potential proposals, we will\n        compare them by looking at how many endpoints\
    \ or gateways must\n        be reconfigured when a new gateway or endpoint is\
    \ added,\n        removed, or changed and how substantial this reconfiguration\
    \ is,\n        in addition to the amount of static configuration required.\n \
    \       This requirement is driven by use cases 1 and 2 and by the\n        scaling\
    \ limitations pointed out in Section 3.1.\n   2.   ADVPN Peers MUST allow IPsec\
    \ tunnels to be set up with other\n        members of the ADVPN without any configuration\
    \ changes, even\n        when peer addresses get updated every time the device\
    \ comes up.\n        This implies that Security Policy Database (SPD) entries\
    \ or\n        other configuration based on a peer IP address will need to be\n\
    \        automatically updated, avoided, or handled in some manner to\n      \
    \  avoid a need to manually update policy whenever an address\n        changes.\n\
    \   3.   In many cases, additional tunneling protocols (e.g., GRE) or\n      \
    \  routing protocols (e.g., OSPF) are run over the IPsec tunnels.\n        Gateways\
    \ MUST allow for the operation of tunneling and routing\n        protocols operating\
    \ over spoke-to-spoke IPsec tunnels with\n        minimal or no configuration\
    \ impact.  The ADVPN solution SHOULD\n        NOT increase the amount of information\
    \ required to configure\n        protocols running over IPsec tunnels.\n   4.\
    \   In the full-mesh and dynamic full-mesh topologies, spokes MUST\n        allow\
    \ for direct communication with other spoke gateways and\n        endpoints. \
    \ In the star topology mode, direct communication\n        between spokes MUST\
    \ be disallowed.\n        This requirement is driven by use cases 1 and 2 and\
    \ by the\n        limitations of a star topology as pointed out in Section 3.2.\n\
    \   5.   ADVPN Peers MUST NOT have a way to get the long-term\n        authentication\
    \ credentials for any other ADVPN Peers.  The\n        compromise of an endpoint\
    \ MUST NOT affect the security of\n        communications between other ADVPN\
    \ Peers.  The compromise of a\n        gateway SHOULD NOT affect the security\
    \ of the communications\n        between ADVPN Peers not associated with that\
    \ gateway.\n        This requirement is driven by use case 1.  ADVPN Peers\n \
    \       (especially spokes) become compromised fairly often.  The\n        compromise\
    \ of one ADVPN Peer SHOULD NOT affect the security of\n        other unrelated\
    \ ADVPN Peers.\n   6.   Gateways SHOULD allow for seamless handoff of sessions\
    \ in cases\n        where endpoints are roaming, even if they cross policy\n \
    \       boundaries.  This would mean the data traffic is minimally\n        affected\
    \ even as the handoff happens.  External factors like\n        firewalls and NAT\
    \ boxes that will be part of the overall\n        solution when ADVPN is deployed\
    \ will not be considered part of\n        this solution.\n        Such endpoint\
    \ roaming may affect not only the endpoint-to-\n        endpoint SA but also the\
    \ relationship between the endpoints and\n        gateways (such as when an endpoint\
    \ roams to a new network that\n        is handled by a different gateway).\n \
    \       This requirement is driven by use case 1.  Today's endpoints are\n   \
    \     mobile and transition often between different networks (from 4G\n      \
    \  to WiFi and among various WiFi networks).\n   7.   Gateways SHOULD allow for\
    \ easy handoff of a session to another\n        gateway, to optimize latency,\
    \ bandwidth, load balancing,\n        availability, or other factors, based on\
    \ policy.\n        This ability to migrate traffic from one gateway to another\n\
    \        applies regardless of whether the gateways in question are hubs\n   \
    \     or spokes.  It even applies in the case where a gateway (hub or\n      \
    \  spoke) moves in the network, as may happen with a vehicle-based\n        network.\n\
    \        This requirement is driven by use case 3.\n   8.   Gateways and endpoints\
    \ MUST have the capability to participate\n        in an ADVPN even when they\
    \ are located behind NAT boxes.\n        However, in some cases they may be deployed\
    \ in such a way that\n        they will not be fully reachable behind a NAT box.\
    \  It is\n        especially difficult to handle cases where the hub is behind\
    \ a\n        NAT box.  When the two endpoints are both behind separate NATs,\n\
    \        communication between these spokes SHOULD be supported using\n      \
    \  workarounds such as port forwarding by the NAT or detecting when\n        two\
    \ spokes are behind uncooperative NATs, and using a hub in\n        that case.\n\
    \        This requirement is driven by use cases 1 and 2.  Endpoints are\n   \
    \     often behind NATs, and gateways sometimes are.  IPsec SHOULD\n        continue\
    \ to work seamlessly regardless, using ADVPN techniques\n        whenever possible\
    \ and providing graceful fallback to hub-and-\n        spoke techniques as needed.\n\
    \   9.   Changes such as establishing a new IPsec SA SHOULD be reportable\n  \
    \      and manageable.  However, creating a MIB or other management\n        technique\
    \ is not within scope for this effort.\n        This requirement is driven by\
    \ manageability concerns for all the\n        use cases, especially use case 2.\
    \  As IPsec networks become more\n        dynamic, management tools become more\
    \ essential.\n   10.  To support allied and federated environments, endpoints\
    \ and\n        gateways from different organizations SHOULD be able to connect\n\
    \        to each other.\n        This requirement is driven by demand for all\
    \ the use cases in\n        federated and allied environments.\n   11.  The administrator\
    \ of the ADVPN SHOULD allow for the\n        configuration of a star, full-mesh,\
    \ or partial full-mesh\n        topology, based on which tunnels are allowed to\
    \ be set up.\n        This requirement is driven by demand for all the use cases\
    \ in\n        federated and allied environments.\n   12.  The ADVPN solution SHOULD\
    \ be able to scale for multicast\n        traffic.\n        This requirement is\
    \ driven by use case 2, where the amount of\n        rich media multicast traffic\
    \ is increasing.\n   13.  The ADVPN solution SHOULD allow for easy monitoring,\
    \ logging,\n        and reporting of the dynamic changes to help with\n      \
    \  troubleshooting such environments.\n        This requirement is driven by demand\
    \ for all the use cases in\n        federated and allied environments.\n   14.\
    \  There is also the case where L3VPNs operate over IPsec tunnels,\n        for\
    \ example, Provider-Edge-based VPNs.  An ADVPN MUST support\n        L3VPNs as\
    \ applications protected by the IPsec tunnels.\n        This requirement is driven\
    \ by demand for all the use cases in\n        federated and allied environments.\n\
    \   15.  The ADVPN solution SHOULD allow the enforcement of per-peer QoS\n   \
    \     in both the star and full-mesh topologies.\n        This requirement is\
    \ driven by demand for all the use cases in\n        federated and allied environments.\n\
    \   16.  The ADVPN solution SHOULD take care of not letting the hub be a\n   \
    \     single point of failure.\n        This requirement is driven by demand for\
    \ all the use cases in\n        federated and allied environments.\n"

  - "5.  Security Considerations\n   This is a problem statement and requirements\
    \ document for the\n   ADVPN solution and in itself does not introduce any new\
    \ security\n   concerns.  The solution to the problems presented in this document\n\
    \   may involve dynamic updates to databases defined by RFC 4301,\n   such as\
    \ the Security Policy Database (SPD) or the Peer Authorization\n   Database (PAD).\n\
    \   RFC 4301 is silent about the way these databases are populated, and\n   it\
    \ is implied that these databases are static and preconfigured by a\n   human.\
    \  Allowing dynamic updates to these databases must be thought\n   out carefully\
    \ because it allows the protocol to alter the security\n   policy that the IPsec\
    \ endpoints implement.\n   One obvious attack to watch out for is stealing traffic\
    \ to a\n   particular site.  The IP address for www.example.com is 192.0.2.10.\n\
    \   If we add an entry to an IPsec endpoint's SPD that says that traffic\n   to\
    \ 192.0.2.10 is protected through peer Gw-Mallory, then this allows\n   Gw-Mallory\
    \ to either pretend to be www.example.com or proxy and read\n   all traffic to\
    \ that site.  Updates to this database require a clear\n   trust model.\n   Hubs\
    \ can be a single point of failure that can cause loss of\n   connectivity of\
    \ the entire system; this can be a big security issue.\n   Any ADVPN solution\
    \ design should take care of these concerns.\n"
