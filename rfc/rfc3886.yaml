  contents:
  - "2.  Other Documents and Conformance\n   The model used for Message Tracking is\
    \ described in [RFC-MTRK-MODEL].\n   Message tracking is intended for use as a\
    \ \"last resort\" mechanism.\n   Normally, Delivery Status Notifications (DSNs)\
    \ [RFC-DSN-SMTP] and\n   Message Disposition Notifications (MDNs) [RFC-MDN] would\
    \ provide the\n   primary delivery status.  Only if no response is received from\
    \ either\n   of these mechanisms would Message Tracking be used.\n   This document\
    \ is based on [RFC-DSN-STAT].  Sections 1.3\n   (Terminology), 2.1.1 (General\
    \ conventions for DSN fields), 2.1.2\n   (\"*-type\" subfields), and 2.1.3 (Lexical\
    \ tokens imported from RFC\n   822) of [RFC-DSN-STAT] are included into this document\
    \ by reference.\n   Other sections are further incorporated as described herein.\n\
    \   Syntax notation in this document conforms to [RFC-ABNF].\n   The following\
    \ lexical tokens, defined in [RFC-MSGFMT], are used in\n   the ABNF grammar for\
    \ MTSNs: atom, CHAR, comment, CR, CRLF, DIGIT, LF,\n   linear-white-space, SPACE,\
    \ text.  The date-time lexical token is\n   defined in [RFC-HOSTREQ].\n   The\
    \ key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n\
    \   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in\
    \ this\n   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC-\n   KEYWORDS].\n"

    \ Notification (MTSN) is intended to be\n   returned as the body of a Message\
    \ Tracking request [RFC-MTRK-MTQP].\n   The actual body MUST be a multipart/related\
    \ [RFC-RELATED] with type\n   parameter of \"message/tracking-status\"; each subpart\
    \ MUST be of type\n   \"message/tracking-status\" as described herein.  The multipart/related\n\

    \   MIME subtype name:        tracking-status\n   Optional parameters:      none\n\
    \   Encoding considerations:  \"7bit\" encoding is sufficient and\n          \

    \          when viewed by non-MIME mail readers.\n   Security considerations:\
    \  discussed in section 4 of this memo.\n   The body of a message/tracking-status\
    \ is modeled after [RFC-DSN-\n   STAT].  That body consists of one or more \"\
    fields\" formatted to\n   according to the ABNF of RFC 2822 header \"fields\"\
    \ (see [RFC-MSGFMT]).\n   The per-message fields appear first, followed by a blank\
    \ line.\n   Following the per-message fields are one or more groups of per-\n\
    \   recipient fields.  Each group of per-recipient fields is preceded by\n   a\
    \ blank line.  Note that there will be a blank line between the final\n   per-recipient\
    \ field and the MIME boundary, since one CRLF is\n   necessary to terminate the\
    \ field, and a second is necessary to\n   introduce the MIME boundary.  Formally,\
    \ the syntax of the\n   message/tracking-status content is as follows:\n   tracking-status-content\
    \ =\n             per-message-fields 1*( CRLF per-recipient-fields )\n   The per-message\

    \ sent to multiple addresses.\n   However, in some cases the delivery occurs to\
    \ a program which,\n   unknown to the MTA, causes mailing list expansion; in the\

    \ There may be cases\n   in which a message recipient is autoforwarding messages\

    \   The desire for such confidentiality will probably be heightened as\n   \"\

    \ addresses.\n   MTA authors are encouraged to provide a mechanism which enables\
    \ the\n   end user to preserve the confidentiality of a forwarding address.\n\
    \   Depending on the degree of confidentiality required, and the nature\n   of\
    \ the environment to which a message were being forwarded, this\n   might be accomplished\
    \ by one or more of:\n   (a)  respond with a \"relayed\" tracking status when\
    \ a message is\n        forwarded to a confidential forwarding address, and disabling\n\
    \        further message tracking requests.\n   (b)  declaring the message to\
    \ be delivered, issuing a \"delivered\"\n        tracking status, re-sending the\
    \ message to the confidential\n        forwarding address, and disabling further\
    \ message tracking\n        requests.\n   The tracking algorithms MUST NOT allow\
    \ tracking through list\n   expansions.  When a message is delivered to a list,\
