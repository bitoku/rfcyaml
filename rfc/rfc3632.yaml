- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   The Network Solutions, Inc. (NSI) Registry Registrar Protocol\
    \ (RRP)\n   was developed by NSI in 1998 and 1999 to allow multiple registrars\
    \ to\n   provide second level Internet domain name registration services in\n\
    \   the top level domains (TLDs) administered by the NSI TLD registry.\n   Version\
    \ 1.1.0 of the NSI RRP was published as Informational RFC 2832\n   [2] in May\
    \ 2000.  This document describes changes to RFC 2832 that\n   specify version\
    \ 2.0.0 of the protocol.\n   Conventions Used In This Document\n      The key\
    \ words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\", \"SHALL\n      NOT\"\
    , \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\"\n   \
    \   in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, RFC\n     \
    \ 2119 [1].\n      In examples, \"C:\" represents lines sent by a protocol client\
    \ and\n      \"S:\"  represents lines returned by a protocol server.\n"
- title: 2.  Protocol Updates
  contents:
  - "2.  Protocol Updates\n   This specification describes several modifications to\
    \ RFC 2832 [2]:\n   two new response codes have been added, domain TRANSFER command\n\
    \   processing has been updated to allow a client to cancel a requested\n   domain\
    \ transfer, and support for IPv6 name server addresses has been\n   added.\n"
- title: 2.1.  Response Codes
  contents:
  - "2.1.  Response Codes\n   Section 5.1 of RFC 2832 [2] has been updated to include\
    \ two\n   additional error response codes.\n   510 Invalid encoding\n   The value\
    \ of a domain name or name server entity contains invalid\n   ASCII compatible\
    \ encoding used to represent an internationalized\n   domain or host name.  The\
    \ encoding is checked and verified in two\n   situations: when registering an\
    \ internationalized domain name or name\n   server name, and when changing the\
    \ name of a name server and the new\n   name of the server is internationalized.\n\
    \   Section 5.2 of RFC 2832 [2] has been updated to include response code\n  \
    \ 510 as a possible error value returned from the ADD command:\n   Command: ADD\n\
    \   Success: 200, 220\n   Failure: 420, 421, 500, 502, 503, 504, 505, 507, 508,\
    \ 510, 520, 531,\n   535, 540, 541, 545, 546, 547, 549, 550, 554\n   557 Name\
    \ server locked\n   An attempt has been made to modify or delete a name server\
    \ that is\n   hosting a TLD in the root zone.  Modifications to the root zone\
    \ can\n   only be made with the approval of the U.S. Department of Commerce and\n\
    \   IANA, so if the registrar absolutely needs to modify or delete such a\n  \
    \ name server, the action needs to be coordinated through the registry\n   operator\
    \ using an out-of-band communications channel.\n   Section 5.2 of RFC 2832 [2]\
    \ has been updated to include response code\n   557 as a possible error value\
    \ returned from the DEL and MOD commands:\n   Command: DEL\n   Success: 200, 220\n\
    \   Failure: 420, 421, 500, 502, 503, 504, 505, 507, 508, 520, 531, 532,\n   533,\
    \ 541, 544, 545, 547, 549, 551, 552, 553, 557\n   Command: MOD\n   Success: 200,\
    \ 220\n   Failure: 420, 421, 500, 502, 503, 504, 505, 507, 508, 510, 520, 531,\n\
    \   535, 540, 541, 542, 543, 544, 545, 547, 549, 550, 551, 552, 553, 557\n"
- title: 2.2.  TRANSFER Command Update
  contents:
  - "2.2.  TRANSFER Command Update\n   Section 4.3.10 of RFC 2832 [2] has been updated\
    \ to include an\n   additional TRANSFER command processing option.\n   Old text:\n\
    \   Authorized User: All registrars MAY use the TRANSFER command to\n   request\
    \ the transfer of registration service authority to the\n   requesting registrar.\
    \  Only the current sponsoring registrar of a\n   domain name may explicitly approve\
    \ or reject a requested transfer.\n   The registry MAY implicitly approve or reject\
    \ requested transfers\n   after a fixed amount of time.\n   New text:\n   Authorized\
    \ User: All registrars MAY use the TRANSFER command to\n   request transfer of\
    \ registration service authority to the requesting\n   registrar.  Only the current\
    \ sponsoring registrar of a domain name\n   may explicitly approve a requested\
    \ transfer.  The current sponsoring\n   registrar MAY explicitly reject a requested\
    \ transfer.  The registry\n   MAY implicitly approve or reject requested transfers\
    \ after a fixed\n   amount of time.  The requesting registrar MAY cancel a pending\n\
    \   request, but the request to cancel the transfer MUST be sent before\n   it\
    \ has been explicitly approved or rejected by the current sponsoring\n   registrar\
    \ or it has been implicitly approved or rejected by the\n   registry.\n   Example:\n\
    \   A registrar cancels a previously requested domain transfer:\n   C:transfer<crlf>\n\
    \   C:-Approve:No<crlf>\n   C:EntityName:Domain<crlf>\n   C:DomainName:example.com<crlf>\n\
