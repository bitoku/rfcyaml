  - "Abstract\n   This document is intended to accomplish two highly inter-related\n\
    \   tasks: to establish an \"initial\" Internet Code Point (ICP) assignment\n\
    \   for each of IPv4 and IPv6 address encoding in Network Service Access\n   Point\
    \ (NSAP) Addresses, and to recommend an IANA assignment policy\n   for currently\
    \ unassigned ICP values.  In the first task, this\n   document is a partial replacement\
    \ for RFC 1888 -- particularly for\n   section 6 of RFC 1888.  In the second task,\
    \ this document\n   incorporates wording and specifications from ITU-T Recommendation\n\
    \   X.213 and further recommends that IANA use the \"IETF consensus\"\n   assignment\
    \ policy in making future ICP assignments.\n"

  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   Section 6 of RFC 1888 [1888] previously provided for assignment\
    \ of\n   the initial Internet Code Point (ICP) value '0' for encoding an IPv6\n\
    \   address in a Network Service Access (or Attachment) Point [NSAP]\n   address.\
    \  RFC 1888 also defined multiple means for restricted\n   encoding of an NSAP\
    \ address in an IPv6 address.\n   The means RFC 1888 defined for encoding NSAP\
    \ addresses in IPv6\n   address format was heavily annotated with warnings and\
    \ limitations\n   that apply should this encoding be used.  Possibly as a result,\
    \ these\n   encodings are not used and appear never to have been used in any IPv6\n\
    \   deployment.  In addition, section 6 contains minor errors.  As a\n   result\
    \ of these various considerations, RFC 1888 [1888] has been\n   obsoleted and\
    \ declared Historic by RFC 4048 [4048].\n   It is the belief of the authors of\
    \ this document that the errors in\n   section 6 of RFC 1888 resulted -- at least\
    \ in part -- because the\n   ITU-T specification [X.213] that originally assigned\
    \ Authority and\n   Format Identifier (AFI) '35' to IANA was not freely publicized,\
    \ nor\n   was it incorporated or explained using the mechanism commonly used in\n\
    \   the IETF, i.e., an RFC.\n   It is therefore part of the purpose of this document\
    \ to provide that\n   explanation.\n   In addition, because there are other documents\
    \ that refer to the IPv6\n   ICP assignment in RFC 1888, it is necessary for the\
    \ errors in section\n   6 of RFC 1888 to be corrected, irrespective of the RFC's\
    \ ultimate\n   status.\n   Finally, no previous RFC (including RFC 1888) has ever\
    \ formalized an\n   assignment of an IPv4 ICP.  This may have been in part because\
    \ of a\n   lack of formal definition of an IANA assignment policy for ICP values\n\
    \   under the IANA-allocated AFI ('35').\n   This document replaces section 6\
    \ of RFC 1888 in defining the ICP for\n   IPv6 address encoding in an NSAP address,\
    \ and it formalizes the ICP\n   assignment for IPv4 address encoding in an NSAP\
    \ address.\n"

- title: 2.  IANA Considerations
  contents:
  - "2.  IANA Considerations\n   An ITU-T Recommendation [X.213] has allocated two\
    \ AFIs designating\n   IANA as the assignment authority.  One of these two AFIs\
    \ ('34') is\n   allocated for assignment of NSAPA in Decimal Numeric Format. \
    \ This\n   document does not address allocation for this AFI as it is not clear\n\
    \   what use (if any) can be made of this encoding format at this time.\n   The\
    \ other AFI ('35') is to be used for binary encoding except as\n   noted below.\n\
    \   The NSAPA format consists of an Initial Domain Part (IDP) and Domain\n   Specific\
    \ Part (DSP).  The IDP, in turn, consists of an Authority and\n   Format Identifier\
    \ (AFI) and an Initial Domain Identifier (IDI).  The\n   AFI is defined to be\
    \ a binary octet, and the IDI is defined to be a\n   four decimal digit number\
    \ encoded in two octets using Binary Coded\n   Decimal format.  Each nibble of\
    \ the IDI is used to represent a\n   decimal digit, using binary value '0000'\
    \ through '1001'.\n   In assigning allocation authority for AFI '35' to IANA,\
    \ the ITU-T\n   Recommendation [X.213] specifies that the two-octet IDI will be\
    \ used\n   to hold an Internet Code Point (ICP) that, because of the decimal\n\
    \   encoding, MUST be in the decimal range from '0' to '9999'.\n   The ITU-T recommendation\
    \ assumes the assignment of ICP '0' (zero) for\n   IPv6 address encoding in a\
    \ Network Service Access Point Address\n   (NSAPA, or often NSAP).  In addition,\
    \ ITU-T assumed that IANA would\n   assign an ICP for IPv4 address encoding in\
    \ an NSAPA and X.213 assumed\n   that the ICP value for this purpose would be\
    \ '1'.\n   In an NSAPA, the DSP is the remaining octets after the IDP.  For AFI\n\
    \   '35', this is 17 octets having a format as defined by IANA or as\n   defined\
    \ by another party and published with IANA consent.\n   IANA, as the authority\
    \ responsible for AFI '35', SHOULD NOT assign an\n   ICP unless there is a corresponding\
    \ defined, and published, format at\n   the time of the code point assignment.\n\
    \   The IANA has assigned the following ICP values:\n       ICP Value   Address\
    \ Encoding   Format Definition\n       ----------  -----------------  ----------------------------\n\
    \          '0'           IPv6          RFC 4548, section 3.2\n          '1'  \
    \         IPv4          RFC 4548, section 3.1\n   Remaining decimal values '2'\
    \ through '9999' MUST be assigned on an\n   IETF consensus basis [2434].\n"
