  - "1.  Introduction\n   This document specifies the syntax and semantics of the\
    \ Uniform\n   Resource Identifier (URI) scheme for the Traversal Using Relays\n\
    \   around NAT (TURN) protocol.\n   The TURN protocol is a specification allowing\
    \ hosts behind NAT to\n   control the operation of a relay server.  The relay\
    \ server allows\n   hosts to exchange packets with its peers.  The peers themselves\
    \ may\n   also be behind NATs.  RFC 5766 [RFC5766] defines the specifics of the\n\
    \   TURN protocol.\n   The \"turn\" and \"turns\" URI schemes are used to designate\
    \ a TURN\n   server (also known as a relay) on Internet hosts accessible using\
    \ the\n   TURN protocol.  With the advent of standards such as WebRTC [WEBRTC],\n\
    \   we anticipate a plethora of endpoints and web applications to be able\n  \
    \ to identify and communicate with such a TURN server to carry out the\n   TURN\
    \ protocol.  This implies that endpoints and/or applications must\n   be provisioned\
    \ with the appropriate configuration to identify the\n   TURN server.  Having\
    \ an inconsistent syntax adds ambiguity and can\n   result in non-interoperable\
    \ solutions and implementation limitations.\n   The \"turn\" and \"turns\" URI\
    \ schemes help alleviate most of these\n   issues by providing a consistent way\
    \ to describe, configure, and\n   exchange the information identifying a TURN\
    \ server.\n   [RFC5928] defines a resolution mechanism to convert a secure flag,\
    \ a\n   host name or IP address, a potentially empty port, and a potentially\n\
    \   empty transport to a list of IP address, port, and TURN transport\n   tuples.\n\
    \   To simplify the provisioning of TURN clients, this document defines\n   the\
    \ \"turn\" and \"turns\" URI schemes that can carry the four components\n   needed\
    \ for the resolution mechanism.\n"
- title: 2.  Terminology
  contents:
  - "2.  Terminology\n   The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"MAY\"\
    , and \"OPTIONAL\"\n   in this document are to be interpreted as described in\
    \ [RFC2119] when\n   they appear in ALL CAPS.  When these words are not in ALL\
    \ CAPS (such\n   as \"should\" or \"Should\"), they have their usual English meanings,\
    \ and\n   are not to be interpreted as RFC 2119 key words.\n"

- title: 3.1.  URI Scheme Syntax
  contents:
  - "3.1.  URI Scheme Syntax\n   The \"turn\" and \"turns\" URIs have the following\
    \ formal ABNF syntax\n   [RFC5234]:\n   turnURI       = scheme \":\" host [ \"\
    :\" port ]\n                   [ \"?transport=\" transport ]\n   scheme      \
    \  = \"turn\" / \"turns\"\n   transport     = \"udp\" / \"tcp\" / transport-ext\n\
    \   transport-ext = 1*unreserved\n   <host> and <port> are specified in [RFC3986].\
    \  While these two ABNF\n   productions are defined in [RFC3986] as components\
    \ of the generic\n   hierarchical URI, this does not imply that the \"turn\" and\
    \ \"turns\"\n   schemes are hierarchical URIs.  Developers MUST NOT use a generic\n\
    \   hierarchical URI parser to parse a \"turn\" or \"turns\" URI.\n   The <host>,\
    \ <port>, and <transport> components are passed without\n   modification to the\
    \ [RFC5928] algorithm.  <secure> is set to false if\n   <scheme> is equal to \"\
    turn\", and set to true if <scheme> is equal to\n   \"turns\" and passed to the\
    \ [RFC5928] algorithm with the other\n   components.\n"
- title: 3.2.  URI Scheme Semantics
  contents:
  - "3.2.  URI Scheme Semantics\n   The \"turn\" and \"turns\" URI schemes are used\
    \ to designate a TURN\n   server (also known as a relay) on Internet hosts accessible\
    \ using the\n   TURN protocol.  The TURN protocol supports sending messages over\
    \ UDP,\n   TCP, or TLS-over-TCP.  The \"turns\" URI scheme MUST be used when TURN\n\
    \   is run over TLS-over-TCP (or, in the future, DTLS-over-UDP), and the\n   \"\
    turn\" scheme MUST be used otherwise.\n   The required <host> part of the \"turn\"\
    \ URI denotes the TURN server\n   host.\n   As specified in [RFC5766] and [RFC5928],\
    \ the <port> part, if present,\n   denotes the port on which the TURN server is\
    \ awaiting connection\n   requests.  If it is absent, the default port is 3478\
    \ for both UDP and\n   TCP.  The default port for TURN over TLS is 5349.\n"
- title: 4.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "4.  Security Considerations\n   Security considerations for the resolution mechanism\
    \ are discussed in\n   Section 5 of [RFC5928].  Note that this section contains\
    \ normative\n   text defining authentication procedures to be followed by turn\n\
    \   clients when TLS is used.\n   The \"turn\" and \"turns\" URI schemes do not\
    \ introduce any specific\n   security issues beyond the security considerations\
    \ discussed in\n   [RFC3986].\n   Although a \"turn\" or \"turns\" URI does not\
    \ itself include the username\n   or password that will be used to authenticate\
    \ the TURN client, in\n   certain environments, such as WebRTC, the username and\
    \ password will\n   almost certainly be provisioned remotely by an external agent\
    \ at the\n   same time as a \"turns\" URI is sent to that client.  Thus, in such\n\
    \   situations, if the username and password were received in the clear,\n   there\
    \ would be little or no benefit to using a \"turns\" URI.  For this\n   reason,\
    \ a TURN client MUST ensure that the username, password,\n   \"turns\" URI, and\
    \ any other security-relevant parameters are received\n   with equivalent security\
    \ before using the \"turns\" URI.  Receiving\n   those parameters over another\
    \ TLS session can provide the appropriate\n   level of security, if both TLS sessions\
    \ are similarly parameterised,\n   e.g., with commensurate strength ciphersuites.\n"
