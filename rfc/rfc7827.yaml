- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   The Internet Research Task Force (IRTF) focuses on longer-term\n\
    \   research issues related to the Internet, while its sister\n   organization,\
    \ the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), focuses on\n   the shorter-term\
    \ issues of engineering and standards making.\n   The IRTF consists of a number\
    \ of topical and long-term Research\n   Groups (RGs).  These groups work on issues\
    \ related to Internet\n   protocols, applications, architecture, and technology.\
    \  RGs have the\n   stable long-term membership that is needed to promote the\
    \ development\n   of research collaboration and teamwork in exploring research\
    \ issues.\n   Individual contributors participate in the IRTF, rather than\n \
    \  representatives of organizations.\n   [RFC2014] details the procedures by which\
    \ RGs operate.  [RFC4440]\n   discusses a view from the Internet Architecture\
    \ Board (IAB) on the\n   IRTF and its relationship to the IETF.  The RFC Editor\
    \ publishes\n   documents from the IRTF and its RGs in the IRTF Stream [RFC5743].\n\
    \   The IRTF Chair is appointed by the IAB [RFC2014] for two-year terms\n   and\
    \ manages the IRTF in consultation with the Internet Research\n   Steering Group\
    \ (IRSG) and -- for some types of decisions -- the IAB.\n   The IRSG membership\
    \ includes the IRTF Chair, the chairs of the\n   various RGs, and other individuals\
    \ (\"members at large\") from the\n   research community selected by the IRTF\
    \ Chair.\n   There is no general appeals process defined for the IRTF.  However,\n\
    \   [RFC2014] states that when an RG disagrees with the IRTF Chair's\n   decision\
    \ to close the group, it can appeal to the IAB.  Since the\n   IRTF Chair serves\
    \ at the discretion of the IAB, it has been current\n   practice to generalize\
    \ this special case in [RFC2014]: any grievances\n   related to the IRTF Chair\
    \ can be taken to the IAB, and it takes\n   appropriate measures.\n"
- title: 2.  Duties
  contents:
  - "2.  Duties\n   This section discusses the various duties of the IRTF Chair and\n\
    \   outlines the skill set a candidate for the role should ideally have.\n"
- title: 2.1.  Strategic
  contents:
  - "2.1.  Strategic\n   Arguably, the most important part of the duties of the IRTF\
    \ Chair is\n   strategic and concerns shaping the purpose and scope of the IRTF,\
    \ by\n   making decisions about which RGs to charter, which RGs to terminate,\n\
    \   and which other activities or efforts the IRTF should organize or\n   affiliate\
    \ itself with in order to further its charter and increase\n   the interaction\
    \ and collaboration between network research,\n   engineering, operations, and\
    \ standardization.\n   For some new RGs, the research and engineering community\
    \ brings a\n   proposal to the IRTF Chair for discussion.  However, it is common\
    \ for\n   the IRTF Chair to identify a new area of research that is considered\n\
    \   of importance to the Internet, actively motivate people in the\n   research\
    \ and engineering community to consider the formation of an\n   RG, and help them\
    \ navigate the process for doing so.\n   In order to be able to fulfill this duty,\
    \ it is important for the\n   IRTF Chair to be involved in both the academic research\
    \ community as\n   well as engineering or operational communities.  Without a\n\
    \   demonstrated history of participation in these often somewhat\n   isolated\
    \ communities, it will be very difficult to identify areas of\n   academic research\
    \ that are suitable for being brought into the IRTF.\n   A good network of contacts\
    \ in these communities will be very helpful\n   in identifying and motivating\
    \ potential RG chairs and participants.\n   Involvement in the academic research\
    \ community can be demonstrated in\n   various ways -- a publication record, membership\
    \ in conference\n   program and organizational committees, participation in publicly\n\
    \   funded collaborative research projects, etc.\n   In addition to chartering\
    \ new RGs, it is equally important for the\n   IRTF to end RGs that have run out\
    \ of energy, are focused on issues no\n   longer considered important for the\
    \ Internet, or are otherwise not\n   operating well.  Careful communication and\
    \ good people skills are\n   essential in order to explain the reasons for concluding\
    \ an RG.  The\n   same skill set is also useful when explaining to proponents\
    \ of a new\n   RG why their request is being denied.\n   The Applied Networking\
    \ Research Prize (ANRP) is a joint award of the\n   Internet Society (ISOC) and\
    \ an example of a strategic initiative that\n   since its inception in 2011 has\
    \ turned into more of an administrative\n   duty.  The IRTF Chair and an ISOC\
    \ representative pick and chair the\n   ANRP selection committee, which advertises\
    \ the ANRP, encourages\n   community nominations for the prizes, and reviews nominations\
    \ and\n   selects prize winners.  The IRTF Chair and the ISOC representative\n\
    \   also mentor the ANRP winners, who are often IETF newcomers, and\n   introduce\
    \ them to other attendees who may have an interest in their\n   work.\n   Chairmanship\
    \ of the ANRP selection committee also relies on strong\n   ties to the academic\
    \ research community, to identify suitable\n   selection committee members and\
    \ to encourage nominations for suitable\n   work that is published in a given\
    \ year.  The selection committee\n   operates similar to a program committee for\
    \ an academic conference\n   (more specifically, it performs a function similar\
    \ to the selection\n   of a best paper award).  It is therefore useful if the\
    \ IRTF Chair has\n   firsthand experience serving on program committees, and ideally,\n\
    \   chairing them.\n"
- title: 2.2.  Administrative
  contents:
  - "2.2.  Administrative\n   A good fraction of the duties of the IRTF Chair are\
    \ administrative.\n   Some of them may be permanently or temporarily delegated\
    \ to other\n   IRSG members, but they ultimately always remain the IRTF Chair's\n\
    \   responsibility.\n   Some of those are related to publishing RFCs on the IRTF\
    \ Stream, such\n   as ensuring sufficient review, so that documents published\
    \ are of\n   good quality; scheduling the required Internet Engineering Steering\n\
    \   Group (IESG) review [RFC5742]; and following up with the IESG, IANA,\n   and\
    \ the RFC Editor during and after the publication process.\n   Other administrative\
    \ duties include reviewing and approving requests\n   from the RGs for time slots\
    \ during IETF meetings or interim meetings\n   elsewhere, ensuring that meeting\
    \ materials are submitted on schedule,\n   maintaining the IRTF web site, and\
    \ -- in cooperation with the RG\n   chairs -- ensuring that the IETF Datatracker\
    \ correctly reflects the\n   status of the various IRTF-related documents.\n \
    \  The IRTF Chair appoints, replaces, and manages the RG chairs and the\n   IRSG,\
    \ and follows the research work of the chartered and proposed RGs\n   to a degree\
    \ that is sufficient to let them develop an understanding\n   on whether they\
    \ are generally operating well.\n   The IRTF Chair also defines the operational\
    \ procedures for the IRTF\n   (in the boundaries defined by [RFC2014]) and the\
    \ IRSG.  At the\n   moment, these procedures are captured as a set of wiki pages\n\
    \   [IRTF-WIKI], and it is the duty of the IRTF Chair to refine and\n   update\
    \ these descriptions as procedures evolve.  When process\n   questions on the\
    \ IRSG or in an RG arise (e.g., on IPR, liaison\n   statements, consensus procedures,\
    \ copyright, plagiarism, document\n   publication, etc.), the IRTF Chair is frequently\
    \ consulted and needs\n   to have sufficient familiarity in the area to provide\
    \ a definitive\n   answer, or at least be able to identify an external party for\
    \ further\n   consultation.\n   The IRSG tries to schedule a working dinner during\
    \ each IETF meeting,\n   and the IRTF Chair is responsible for organizing the\
    \ agenda and a\n   suitable venue.\n   The IRTF Chair provides a status report\
    \ on the IRTF to the IAB on a\n   monthly basis and also writes a regular column\
    \ for the IETF Journal\n   [IETF-JOURNAL] on recent IRTF-related events.\n   During\
    \ each IETF meeting, the IRTF Chair is responsible for\n   organizing and chairing\
    \ the \"IRTF Open Meeting\", during which topics\n   related to the IRTF are presented\
    \ and discussed.  This includes a\n   report by the IRTF Chair on the status of\
    \ the IRTF and its RGs (an\n   abbreviated version of this report is also usually\
    \ given during the\n   IETF technical plenary) as well as other presentations\
    \ from RGs, ANRP\n   prize winners, individuals wishing to propose new RGS, or\
    \ others.\n   These administrative duties are very similar to part of the duties\
    \ of\n   an Area Director (AD) in the IETF and require the same set of\n   organizational\
    \ and communication skills [IESG-EXP].  They also\n   require a regular time commitment\
    \ throughout the year, the ability to\n   attend most of the IETF meetings in\
    \ person, as well as some other\n   related travel.\n   The IRTF Chair regularly\
    \ interacts with the ADs and the IESG for\n   document reviews, planning IETF\
    \ meeting agendas, and providing input\n   on various IETF efforts and topics.\
    \  The IRTF Chair also regularly\n   interacts with the IETF Administrative Oversight\
    \ Committee (IAOC) and\n   the IETF Secretariat for meeting planning, budgeting,\
    \ and other\n   organizational purposes.  In addition, the IRTF Chair also interacts\n\
    \   with the Tools Team to provide input on how IETF tools can best\n   support\
    \ the operation of the IRTF.  Finally, the IRTF Chair is the\n   owner of the\
    \ IRTF Stream of RFCs and is hence part of the group that\n   reviews the RFC\
    \ Editor's performance and operation; also, the IRTF\n   Chair engages with the\
    \ Independent Submission Editor in cases where\n   submissions on the Independent\
    \ Stream have relationships to the IRTF.\n   A good understanding of the purpose\
    \ and procedures of these different\n   bodies and a good working relationship\
    \ with the individuals serving\n   on them are important.\n"
- title: 2.3.  IAB Membership
  contents:
  - "2.3.  IAB Membership\n   The IRTF Chair serves as an \"ex officio\" member of\
    \ the IAB [RFC2850]\n   and is expected to participate in IAB discussions and\
    \ activities\n   alongside the NomCom-appointed IAB members.\n   This duty benefits\
    \ from expertise that is similar to those of full\n   IAB members [IAB-EXP] and\
    \ requires a similar time and travel\n   commitment, for example, to attend IAB\
    \ retreats, relevant IAB\n   workshops, as well as other meetings the IAB is participating\
    \ in or\n   organizing.  Per [IAB-EXP], \"it is desirable for IAB members to have\n\
    \   technical leadership experience, operational management backgrounds,\n   research\
    \ or academic backgrounds, implementation experience, and\n   experience in other\
    \ bodies involved in Internet governance.\"\n   The IRTF Chair frequently provides\
    \ input to \"birds of a feather\"\n   (BoF) sessions, either as an ex officio\
    \ IAB member (i.e., as a \"BoF\n   shepherd\") or because it may be unclear whether\
    \ a proposed effort\n   should be started as an IETF WG or an IRTF RG.\n"
