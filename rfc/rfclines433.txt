The czar of socket numbers [Jon Postel] has established the following assignments for socket numbers used for public functions.
Note that a socket number is a 40 bit quantity, the first 8 bits being the host specification, the next 24 bits being site specific, and the last 8 bits being user specified these last 8 bits are called the AEN [it stands for, cleverly enough, Another Eightbit Number].
For the assignments here the value in the host field ranges across all hosts (unless otherwise specified), the value in the 24 bit field is zero, and the AEN is indicated here.
Any Experimental Function Particular Assignments:
It has come to our attention that there are several hosts performing useful public services on sockets which conflict with the above scheme.
We hope we can resolve this problem with a minimum of disruption.
The following is a tabulation of socket numbers together with the services offered.
This listing is presented as an aid to network users.
If you know of a socket/function which has been left out or an entry which should be corrected or deleted please contact: Jon Postel 3804 Boelter Hall Computer Science Department University of California Los Angeles, CA.

We will be pleased to include socket/function information for other than "offical" sockets [e.g Tip News].
