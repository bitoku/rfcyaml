    the documents that describe the current\n   Internet-Standard Management Framework,
    please refer to section 7 of\n   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].\n   Managed objects are accessed
    via a virtual information store, termed\n   the Management Information Base or
    MIB.  MIB objects are generally\n   accessed through the Simple Network Management
    Protocol (SNMP).\n   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined
    in the\n   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB\n
    \  module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,\n   RFC
    2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580\n   [RFC2580].\n"

  - "2.  Overview\n   This document describes a management information base for the\n
    \  Intermediate System to Intermediate System (IS-IS) Routing protocol,\n   as
    described in ISO 10589 [ISO10589], when it is used to construct\n   routing tables
    for IP networks, as described in RFC 1195 [RFC1195].\n   The objects are mainly
    derived from the Guidelines for Definition of\n   Managed Objects (GDMO) definitions
    in ISO 10589 and from the GDMO\n   definitions in ISO 10733 [ISO10733].  There
    are also additional\n   objects for managing the IP-specific functionality of
    Integrated IS-\n   IS operation.\n   This MIB imports definitions from SNMPv2-TC
    [RFC2579], SNMPv2-SMI\n   [RFC2578], SNMPv2-CONF [RFC2580], SNMP-FRAMEWORK-MIB
    [RFC3411],\n   DIFFSERV-MIB [RFC3289], IF-MIB [RFC2863], and INET-ADDRESS-MIB\n
    \  [RFC4001].  See the imports section of the MIB for the specific items\n   imported.\n
    \  This MIB defines some objects to manage Mesh Groups, described in\n   [RFC2973],
    and a three-way handshake for point-to-point adjacencies,\n   described in [RFC3373].\n
    \  The IS-IS MIB defines the following objects:\n   System-Wide Attributes\n      -
    \ isisSystem\n         This table contains information specific to a single instance\n
    \        of the IS-IS protocol running on a router.\n      -  isisManAreaAddr\n
    \        This table includes area addresses that are manually\n         configured,
    which are used to control the associations formed\n         between Level 1 Intermediate
    Systems.\n      -  isisAreaAddr\n         This table includes area addresses reported
    in relevant L1\n         LSPs.\n      -  isisSummAddr\n         This table holds
    summary addresses configured for each Level 2\n         instance of the IS-IS
    protocol running on a router.\n      -  isisRedistributeAddr\n         This table
    provides criteria to decide whether a route should\n         be leaked from L2
    to L1 when Domain Wide Prefix leaking is\n         enabled.\n      -  isisRouter\n
    \        This table holds the hostname and router ID for Intermediate\n         Systems
    in the network.\n      -  isisSysLevel\n         This table contains information
    specific to a domain (Level 2)\n         or an area (Level 1) of the IS-IS protocol.\n
    \     -  isisNextCircIndex\n         This scalar is used to provide a unique circuit
    index.\n   Circuit-specific Attributes\n      -  isisCirc\n         This table
    contains information specific to a point-to-point or\n         a broadcast interface
    in the system.\n      -  isisCircLevel\n         This table contains information
    specific to Level 1 or Level 2\n         of an interface.\n   Counters\n      -
    \ isisSystemCounter\n         Counters in the System table, such as number of
    times we have\n         wrapped a sequence counter on one of our Link State PDUs.\n
    \     -  isisCircuitCounter\n         Counters of events particular to a circuit,
    such as PDUs with\n         an illegal value of the System ID field length.\n
    \     -  isisPacketCounter\n         Counts of IS-IS Protocol PDUs broken down
    into packet type.\n   Attributes associated with an Adjacency\n      -  isisISAdj\n
    \        This table contains information about adjacencies to routers\n         maintained
    by the protocol.  Entries in this table cannot be\n         created by management
    action: they are established through the\n         Hello protocol.\n      -  isisISAdjAreaAddr\n
    \        This table contains the set of Area Addresses of neighboring\n         Intermediate
    Systems, as reported in IIH PDUs.\n      -  isisISAdjIPAddr\n         This table

    as reported in received IIH PDUs.\n      -  isisISAdjProtSupp\n         This table
    contains the set of protocols supported by\n         neighboring Intermediate
    Systems, as reported in received IIH\n         PDUs.\n   Attributes Associated
    with Addresses\n      -  isisRA\n         The Reachable Address Table.\n         This
    table contains information about an address prefix\n         manually configured
    on the system or learned through another\n         protocol.\n      -  isisIPRA\n
    \        The IP Reachable Address Table.\n         This table contains information
    about an IP reachable address\n         manually configured on this system or
    learned from another\n         protocol.\n   Attributes Associated with Link State
    PDU Table\n      -  isisLSPSummaryTable\n         The Link State PDU Summary Table.\n
    \        This table contains information contained in the headers of\n         Link
    State PDUs stored by the system.\n      -  isisLSPTLVTable\n         The Link
    State PDU TLV Table.\n         This table holds the sequence of TLVs that make
    up an LSP\n         fragment.\n   Attributes Associated with a Notification\n
    \     -  isisNotification\n         This table defines attributes that will be
    included when\n         reporting IS-IS notifications.\n"

    \ This\n   version has been modified to include MIB-II syntax, to exclude\n   portions
    of the protocol that are not relevant to IP, such as the\n   ES-IS protocol, and
    to add management support for current practice.\n   We would like to thank the

    be considered\n   sensitive in some network environments.\n"
  - contents:
    - "7.1.  Discussion\n   This MIB may be used to manage an IP router, which is
      used to direct\n   network traffic.  The control of network traffic allows an
      attacker\n   to deny service to a region of the network or to forward traffic
      to\n   adversaries.  By raising or lowering metrics, traffic may be directed\n
      \  to insecure portions of the network.  By disabling the protocol on an\n   interface,
      the network may be partitioned.  Changes to the network\n   topology will force
      all routers to recompute their routes.  Periodic\n   route changes have brought
      down networks in the past by subjecting\n   routers to stressful recomputations.\n
      \  There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB that\n   have
      a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such\n   objects may
      be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network\n   environments.  The
      support for SET operations in a non-secure\n   environment without proper protection
      can have a negative effect on\n   network operations.  Authentication of received
      SNMP requests and\n   controlled access to management information should be
      employed in\n   such environments.\n   We identify a set of threats and then
      list attributes that can be\n   used in each form of attack.  We discuss the
      effects that can be\n   obtained by a single change to the variable in each
      class.\n"

      - "7.2.13.  Recommendations\n   Much of the MIB is used to set or read attributes
        which are readily\n   visible to any intruder who has access to traffic.  None
        of the\n   security attributes are setable or visible through the MIB.  Read\n
        \  access to the MIB does not pose additional risks or vulnerabilities.\n
        \  If write access is to be provided, it is RECOMMENDED that\n   implementers
        consider the security features as provided by the SNMPv3\n   framework (see
        [RFC3410], section 8), including full support for the\n   SNMPv3 cryptographic
        mechanisms (for authentication and privacy).\n   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3
        did not include adequate security.\n   Even if the network itself is secure
        (for example by using IPSec),\n   even then, there is no control as to who
        on the secure network is\n   allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete)
        the objects\n   in this MIB module.\n   Deployment of SNMP versions prior
        to SNMPv3 is NOT RECOMMENDED.\n   Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3
        and to enable\n   cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator\n
        \  responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an\n   instance
        of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to\n   the objects
        only to those principals (users) that have legitimate\n   rights to indeed
        GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.\n"
