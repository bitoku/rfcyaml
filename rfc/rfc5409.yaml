  - "1.  Introduction\n   This document defines the way to use the Boneh-Franklin\
    \ [IBCS] and\n   Boneh-Boyen [IBCS] identity-based encryption (IBE) public-key\n\
    \   algorithms in the Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) [CMS].  IBE is a\n  \
    \ public-key technology for encrypting content-encryption keys (CEKs)\n   that\
    \ can be implemented within the framework of the CMS: the\n   recipient's identity\
    \ is incorporated into the EnvelopedData CMS\n   content type using the OtherRecipientInfo\
    \ CHOICE in the RecipientInfo\n   field as defined in Section 6.2.5 of [CMS].\
    \  This document does not\n   describe the implementation of the BF and BB1 algorithms,\
    \ which are\n   described in detail in [IBCS].\n   IBE algorithms are a type of\
    \ public-key cryptographic algorithm in\n   which the public key is calculated\
    \ directly from a user's identity\n   instead of being generated randomly.  This\
    \ requires a different set\n   of steps for encryption and decryption than would\
    \ be used with other\n   public-key algorithms, and these steps are defined in\
    \ Sections 4 and\n   5 of this document, respectively.\n   This document also\
    \ defines the object identifiers and syntax of the\n   object that is used to\
    \ define the identity of a message recipient.\n   CMS values and identity objects\
    \ are defined using ASN.1 [ASN1].\n"

  contents:
  - "1.2.  IBE Overview\n   In addition to the client components that are described\
    \ in this\n   document, the following additional components are required for a\n\
    \   complete IBE messaging system.\n      o  A Private-Key Generator (PKG).  The\
    \ PKG contains the\n         cryptographic material, known as a master secret,\
    \ for\n         generating an individual's IBE private key.  A PKG accepts an\n\
    \         IBE user's private key request and, after successfully\n         authenticating\
    \ them in some way, returns their IBE private key.\n      o  A Public Parameter\
    \ Server (PPS).  IBE system parameters include\n         publicly sharable cryptographic\
    \ material, known as IBE public\n         parameters, and policy information for\
    \ the PKG.  A PPS provides\n         a well-known location for distribution of\
    \ IBE public parameters\n         and policy information for the IBE PKG.\n  \
    \ The interactions of senders and receivers of IBE-encrypted messages\n   are\
    \ described in [IBE].  All communications between users of an IBE\n   system and\
    \ the PPS or PKG MUST be protected using TLS [TLS] as\n   described in [IBE].\
    \  This provides confidentiality and integrity of\n   all information that is\
    \ delivered to users as well as authentication\n   of the PPS and PKG.\n"
- title: 2.  Using Identity-Based Encryption
  contents:
  - "2.  Using Identity-Based Encryption\n   To use IBE, the ori field in RecipientInfo\
    \ MUST be used.  The fields\n   are set as follows: oriType is set to ibeORIType;\
    \ oriValue is set to\n   ibeORIValue.\n   These fields have the following meanings:\n\
    \   ibeORIType defines the object identifier (OID) that indicates that\n   the\
    \ subsequent ibeORIValue is the information necessary to decrypt\n   the message\
    \ using IBE.  This field MUST be set to the following:\n   ibeORIType OBJECT IDENTIFIER\
    \ ::= {\n     joint-iso-itu(2) country(16) us(840)\n     organization(1) identicrypt(114334)\n\
    \     ibcs(1) cms(4) ori-oid(1) version(1)\n   }\n   ibeORIValue defines the identity\
    \ that was used in the IBE algorithm\n   to encrypt the CEK.  This is an IBERecipientInfo\
    \ type, which is\n   defined as follows:\n   IBERecipientInfo ::= SEQUENCE {\n\
    \     cmsVersion         INTEGER { v3(3) },\n     keyFetchMethod     OBJECT IDENTIFIER,\n\
    \     recipientIdentity  IBEIdentityInfo,\n     serverInfo         SEQUENCE SIZE\
    \ (1..MAX) OF\n       OIDValuePairs OPTIONAL,\n     encryptedKey       EncryptedKey\n\
    \   }\n   The fields of IBERecipientInfo MUST be set as follows.\n   The cmsVersion\
    \ MUST be set to 3.\n   The keyFetchMethod is the OID that defines the method\
    \ of retrieving\n   the private key that the recipient MUST use.  This SHOULD\
    \ be set to\n   uriPPSOID [IBE], which is defined to be the following:\n   uriPPSOID\
    \ OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= {\n     joint-iso-itu-t(2) country(16) us(840)\n     organization(1)\
    \ identicrypt(114334)\n     pps-schemas(3) ic-schemas(1) pps-uri(1) version(1)\n\
    \   }\n   The recipientIdentity is the data that the sender used to calculate\n\
    \   the IBE public key that the sender used to encrypt the content-\n   encryption\
    \ key.  This recipientIdentity is used to calculate IBE\n   public and private\
    \ keys as described in [IBCS].  This MUST be a DER-\n   encoded [DER] IBEIdentityInfo\
    \ type [IBE], which is defined as\n   follows:\n   IBEIdentityInfo ::= SEQUENCE\
    \ {\n     district        IA5String,\n     serial          INTEGER,\n     identityType\
    \    OBJECT IDENTIFIER,\n     identityData    OCTET STRING\n   }\n   The identityType\
    \ defines the format that is used to encode the\n   information that defines the\
    \ identity of the recipient.  This MUST be\n   set to cmsIdentityOID to indicate\
    \ that identityData contains an\n   EmailIdentityData type.  The value of cmsIdentityOID\
    \ is the\n   following:\n   cmsIdentityOID OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= {\n     joint-iso-itu-t(2)\
    \ country(16) us(840)\n     organization(1) identicrypt(114334)\n     keyschemas(2)\
    \ icschemas(1) email(1) version(1)\n   }\n   The identityData MUST be an EmailIdentityData\
    \ type, which is defined\n   as follows:\n   EmailIdentityData ::= SEQUENCE {\n\
    \     rfc822Name   IA5String,\n     time         GeneralizedTime\n   }\n   The\
    \ rfc822Name field is the email address of the recipient in the\n   format defined\
    \ in Section 4.2.1.6 of [PKIX] for the rfc822Name\n   subjectAltName variant.\
    \  Rules for encoding Internet mail addresses\n   that include internationalized\
    \ domain names are specified in Section\n   7.5 of [PKIX].\n   The value of the\
    \ time field is the UTC time after which the sender\n   wants to let the recipient\
    \ decrypt the message, so it may be called\n   the \"not-before\" time.  This\
    \ is usually set to the time when the\n   message is encrypted, but MAY be set\
    \ to a future time.  The value of\n   \"time\" MUST be expressed in Greenwich\
    \ Mean Time (Zulu), MUST include\n   seconds (i.e., times are always YYYYMMDDHHMMSSZ),\
    \ even where the\n   number of seconds is equal to zero, and MUST be expressed\
    \ to the\n   nearest second.\n   The sender of an IBE-encrypted message may want\
    \ to express this time\n   rounded to a time interval to create a key lifetime.\
    \  A key lifetime\n   reduces the number of IBE private keys that a recipient\
    \ needs to\n   retrieve, but still forces the IBE user to periodically re-\n \
    \  authenticate.  Based on the time interval chosen a recipient would\n   only\
    \ have to retrieve a new IBE key once during the interval.  To do\n   this, follow\
    \ the steps below.  Let \"time-interval\" be the number of\n   seconds in this\
    \ larger time interval.\n      1. Find the GeneralizedTime for the not-before\
    \ value.\n      2. Convert this GeneralizedTime into the number of seconds since\n\
    \         January 1, 1970.  Call this \"total-time\".\n      3. Calculate reduced-time\
    \ =\n         (floor (total-time / time-interval)) * time-interval.\n      4.\
    \ Convert reduced-time to a GeneralizedTime to get the not-before\n         \"\
    time\" value.\n   An example of this algorithm for computing a one-week time interval\n\
    \   is as follows.\n      1. Suppose that the GeneralizedTime is 20020401000000Z.\n\
    \      2. Then the total-time is 1017612000.\n      3. A time-interval of 1 week\
    \ is 604800 seconds.\n         So the reduced-time = (floor (1017612000 / 604800))\
    \ * 604800 =\n         1017273600.\n      4. This gives the GeneralizedTime form\
    \ of the reduced-time of\n         20020328000000Z.\n   When issuing IBE private\
    \ keys, a PKG SHOULD NOT issue them too far\n   into the future.  This restriction\
    \ is to prevent an adversary who\n   obtains an IBE user's authentication credentials\
    \ from requesting\n   private keys far into the future and therefore negating\
    \ the periodic\n   IBE user re-authentication that key lifetime provides.  For\
    \ example,\n   if a one-week period is chosen for the key lifetime, then IBE private\n\
    \   keys should not be issued more than one week in advance.  Otherwise,\n   once\
    \ an adversary gains access to the PKG via the stolen IBE user\n   credentials,\
    \ they can request all future keys and negate the IBE user\n   authentication\
    \ restraints in place.\n   The serverInfo is an optional sequence of OID-value\
    \ pairs that are\n   defined to be the following:\n   OIDValuePairs ::= SEQUENCE\
    \ {\n     fieldID     OBJECT IDENTIFIER,\n     fieldData   OCTET STRING\n   }\n\
    \   These can be used to convey any other information that might be used\n   by\
    \ a PKG.  Examples of such information could include the user\n   interface that\
    \ the recipient will experience.  Differences in the\n   user interface could\
    \ include localization information or commercial\n   branding information.  A\
    \ client MUST ignore any part of serverInfo\n   that it is unable to process.\n\
    \   The encryptedKey is the result of encrypting the CEK with an IBE\n   algorithm\
    \ using recipientIdentity as the IBE public key.\n"

    \ assume that\n   capable administrators of an IBE system will select parameters\

    \   Attacks that give an adversary the ability to access or change the\n   information\

    \   concern, it is highly RECOMMENDED that best practices for physical\n   and\

    \ for critical administrative functions and SHOULD\n   maintain auditable logs\
    \ of all security-critical events that occur in\n   an operating IBE system.\n\
    \   Similarly, we assume that users of an IBE system will behave\n   responsibly,\

    \ as a legitimate IBE PPS or PKG.  The\n   protocols rely on the server authentication\
    \ mechanism of TLS [TLS].\n   In addition to the TLS server authentication mechanism,\
    \ IBE client\n   software can provide protection against this possibility by providing\n\
    \   user interface capabilities that allows users to visually determine\n   that\
    \ a connection to PPS and PKG servers is legitimate.  This\n   additional capability\
    \ can help ensure that users cannot easily be\n   tricked into providing valid\
    \ authorization credentials to an\n   attacker.\n   The protocols defined in this\
    \ document are also vulnerable to attacks\n   against an IBE PPS or PKG.  Denial-of-service\
    \ attacks against either\n   component can result in users unable to encrypt or\
    \ decrypt using IBE,\n   and users of an IBE system SHOULD take the appropriate\n\
    \   countermeasures [DOS, BGPDOS] that their use of IBE requires.\n   The IBE\
    \ user authentication method used by an IBE PKG SHOULD be of\n   sufficient strength\
    \ to prevent attackers from easily guessing the IBE\n   user's authentication\
    \ credentials through trial and error.\n"
