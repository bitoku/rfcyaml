    \ to announce PCEs\n   consists of using IGP flooding.  For that purpose, this\
    \ document\n   defines extensions to the Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) routing\n\

  - "1.  Introduction\n   [RFC4655] describes the motivations and architecture for\
    \ a Path\n   Computation Element (PCE)-based path computation model for\n   Multi-Protocol\
    \ Label Switching (MPLS) and Generalized MPLS (GMPLS)\n   Traffic Engineered Label\
    \ Switched Paths (TE LSPs).  The model allows\n   for the separation of the PCE\
    \ from a Path Computation Client (PCC)\n   (also referred to as a non co-located\
    \ PCE) and allows for cooperation\n   between PCEs (where one PCE acts as a PCC\
    \ to make requests of the\n   other PCE).  This relies on a communication protocol\
    \ between a PCC\n   and PCE, and also between PCEs.  The requirements for such\
    \ a\n   communication protocol can be found in [RFC4657], and the\n   communication\
    \ protocol is defined in [PCEP].\n   The PCE architecture requires that a PCC\
    \ be aware of the location of\n   one or more PCEs in its domain, and, potentially,\
    \ of PCEs in other\n   domains, e.g., in the case of inter-domain TE LSP computation.\n\
    \   A network may contain a large number of PCEs, each with potentially\n   distinct\
    \ capabilities.  In such a context, it is highly desirable to\n   have a mechanism\
    \ for automatic and dynamic PCE discovery that allows\n   PCCs to automatically\
    \ discover a set of PCEs, along with additional\n   information about each PCE\
    \ that may be used by a PCC to perform PCE\n   selection.  Additionally, it is\
    \ valuable for a PCC to dynamically\n   detect new PCEs, failed PCEs, or any modification\
    \ to the PCE\n   information.  Detailed requirements for such a PCE discovery\n\
    \   mechanism are provided in [RFC4674].\n   Note that the PCE selection algorithm\
    \ applied by a PCC is out of the\n   scope of this document.\n   When PCCs are\
    \ LSRs participating in the IGP (OSPF or IS-IS), and PCEs\n   are either LSRs\
    \ or servers also participating in the IGP, an\n   effective mechanism for PCE\
    \ discovery within an IGP routing domain\n   consists of utilizing IGP advertisements.\n\
    \   This document defines extensions to OSPFv2 [RFC2328] and OSPFv3\n   [RFC2740]\
    \ to allow a PCE in an OSPF routing domain to advertise its\n   location, along\
    \ with some information useful to a PCC for PCE\n   selection, so as to satisfy\
    \ dynamic PCE discovery requirements set\n   forth in [RFC4674].\n   Generic capability\
    \ advertisement mechanisms for OSPF are defined in\n   [RFC4970].  These allow\
    \ a router to advertise its capabilities within\n   an OSPF area or an entire\
    \ OSPF routing domain.  This document\n   leverages this generic capability advertisement\
    \ mechanism to fully\n   satisfy the dynamic PCE discovery requirements.\n   This\
    \ document defines a new TLV (named the PCE Discovery TLV (PCED\n   TLV)) to be\
    \ carried within the OSPF Router Information LSA\n   ([RFC4970]).\n   The PCE\
    \ information advertised is detailed in Section 3.  Protocol\n   extensions and\
    \ procedures are defined in Sections 4 and 5.\n   The OSPF extensions defined\
    \ in this document allow for PCE discovery\n   within an OSPF routing domain.\
    \  Solutions for PCE discovery across\n   Autonomous System boundaries are beyond\
    \ the scope of this document,\n   and are for further study.\n"

  contents:
  - "3.1.  PCE Discovery Information\n   The PCE discovery information is composed\
    \ of:\n   -  The PCE location: an IPv4 and/or IPv6 address that is used to\n \
    \     reach the PCE.  It is RECOMMENDED to use an address that is always\n   \
    \   reachable if there is any connectivity to the PCE;\n   -  The PCE path computation\
    \ scope (i.e., intra-area, inter-area,\n      inter-AS, or inter-layer);\n   -\
    \  The set of one or more PCE-Domain(s) into which the PCE has\n      visibility\
    \ and for which the PCE can compute paths;\n   -  The set of zero, one, or more\
    \ neighbor PCE-Domain(s) toward which\n      the PCE can compute paths;\n   -\
    \  A set of communication capabilities (e.g., support for request\n      prioritization)\
    \ and path computation-specific capabilities (e.g.,\n      supported constraints).\n\
    \   PCE discovery information is, by nature, fairly static and does not\n   change\
    \ with PCE activity.  Changes in PCE discovery information may\n   occur as a\
    \ result of PCE configuration updates, PCE\n   deployment/activation, PCE deactivation/suppression,\
    \ or PCE failure.\n   Hence, this information is not expected to change frequently.\n"

    \ OSPF can be\n   limited to one or more OSPF areas the PCE belongs to, or can\
    \ be\n   extended across the entire OSPF routing domain.\n   Note that some PCEs\
    \ may belong to multiple areas, in which case the\n   flooding scope may comprise\
    \ these areas.  This could be the case for\n   an ABR, for instance, advertising\

    \ or inter-layer TE LSP computation,\n   respectively.  These bits are non-exclusive.\n\
    \   When set, the Rd bit indicates that the PCE can act as a default PCE\n   for\

    \ be clear on transmission and MUST be ignored on receipt.\n   The PrefL, PrefR,\
    \ PrefS, and PrefY fields are each three bits long\n   and allow the PCE to specify\
    \ a preference for each computation scope,\n   where 7 reflects the highest preference.\
    \  Such preferences can be\n   used for weighted load balancing of path computation\
    \ requests.  An\n   operator may decide to configure a preference for each computation\n\
    \   scope at each PCE so as to balance the path computation load among\n   them.\
    \  The algorithms used by a PCC to load balance its path\n   computation requests\
    \ according to such PCE preferences is out of the\n   scope of this document and\
    \ is a matter for local or network-wide\n   policy.  The same or different preferences\
    \ may be used for each\n   scope.  For instance, an operator that wants a PCE\
    \ capable of both\n   inter-area and inter-AS computation to be preferred for\

  - "5.  Elements of Procedure\n   The PCED TLV is advertised within OSPFv2 Router\
    \ Information LSAs\n   (Opaque type of 4 and Opaque ID of 0) or OSPFv3 Router\
    \ Information\n   LSAs (function code of 12), which are defined in [RFC4970].\
    \  As such,\n   elements of procedure are inherited from those defined in [RFC4970].\n\
    \   In OSPFv2, the flooding scope is controlled by the opaque LSA type\n   (as\
    \ defined in [RFC2370]) and in OSPFv3, by the S1/S2 bits (as\n   defined in [RFC2740]).\
    \  If the flooding scope is area local, then the\n   PCED TLV MUST be carried\
    \ within an OSPFv2 type 10 router information\n   LSA or an OSPFV3 Router Information\
    \ LSA with the S1 bit set and the\n   S2 bit clear.  If the flooding scope is\
    \ the entire IGP domain, then\n   the PCED TLV MUST be carried within an OSPFv2\
    \ type 11 Router\n   Information LSA or OSPFv3 Router Information LSA with the\
    \ S1 bit\n   clear and the S2 bit set.  When only the L bit of the PATH-SCOPE\n\
    \   sub-TLV is set, the flooding scope MUST be area local.\n   When the PCE function\
    \ is deactivated, the OSPF speaker advertising\n   this PCE MUST originate a new\
    \ Router Information LSA that no longer\n   includes the corresponding PCED TLV,\
    \ provided there are other TLVs in\n   the LSA.  If there are no other TLVs in\
    \ the LSA, it MUST either send\n   an empty Router Information LSA or purge it\
    \ by prematurely aging it.\n   The PCE address (i.e., the address indicated within\
    \ the PCE-ADDRESS\n   sub-TLV) SHOULD be reachable via some prefixes advertised\
    \ by OSPF.\n   The PCED TLV information regarding a specific PCE is only considered\n\
    \   current and useable when the router advertising this information is\n   itself\
    \ reachable via OSPF calculated paths in the same area of the\n   LSA in which\
    \ the PCED TLV appears.\n   A change in the state of a PCE (activate, deactivate,\
    \ parameter\n   change) MUST result in a corresponding change in the PCED TLV\n\
    \   information advertised by an OSPF router (inserted, removed, updated)\n  \
    \ in its LSA.  The way PCEs determine the information they advertise,\n   and\
    \ how that information is made available to OSPF, is out of the\n   scope of this\
    \ document.  Some information may be configured (e.g.,\n   address, preferences,\
    \ scope) and other information may be\n   automatically determined by the PCE\
