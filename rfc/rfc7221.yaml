  - "1.  Introduction\n   The productive output of an IETF working group (WG) is documents,\
    \ as\n   mandated by the working group's charter.  Working groups develop\n  \
    \ these documents based on initial input at varying levels of maturity.\n   An\
    \ initial working group draft might be a document already in wide\n   use, or\
    \ it might be a blank sheet, wholly created by the working\n   group, or it might\
    \ represent any level of maturity in between.  This\n   document discusses how\
    \ a working group typically handles the formal\n   documents that it targets for\
    \ publication.  The discussion applies\n   only to the IETF and does not cover\
    \ IRTF groups, where practices vary\n   widely.\n   Within the general constraints\
    \ of formal IETF process and the\n   specific constraints of a working group's\
    \ charter, there can be\n   considerable freedom in the adoption and development\
    \ of drafts.  As\n   with most IETF activities, the ultimate arbiter of such choices\
    \ is\n   working group agreement, within the constraints of its charter.  As\n\
    \   with most working group management, this agreement might be explicit\n   or\
    \ implicit, depending upon the efficiencies that the group deems\n   appropriate.\n\
    \   NOTE:  This document is intentionally non-normative.  It is meant as\n   \
    \   a guide to common practice, rather than as a formal definition of\n      what\
    \ is permissible.\n"
- title: 1.1.  What Is a WG Draft?
  contents:
  - "1.1.  What Is a WG Draft?\n   Working group drafts are documents that are subject\
    \ to IETF working\n   group revision control, with advancement for publication\
    \ as an RFC\n   requiring rough consensus in the working group and then in the\n\
    \   broader IETF.  Creation or adoption of a draft by a working group --\n   as\
    \ well as substantive changes to the document -- need to represent\n   working\
    \ group rough consensus.\n   Documents under development in the IETF community\
    \ are distributed as\n   Internet-Drafts (I-Ds) [RFC2026] [ID-Info].  Working\
    \ groups use this\n   mechanism for producing their official output, per Section\
    \ 7.2 of\n   [RFC2418] and Section 6.3 of [Tao].  The common convention for\n\
    \   identifying an I-D formally under the ownership of a working group is\n  \
    \ by the inclusion of \"ietf\" in the second field of the I-D filename\n   and\
    \ the working group name in the third field, per Section 7 of\n   [ID-Guidelines].\
    \  That is:\n                          draft-ietf-<wgname>-...\n   In contrast,\
    \ individual submissions are drafts being created and\n   pursued outside of a\
    \ working group, although a working group might\n   choose to adopt the draft\
    \ later, as discussed below.  Anyone is free\n   to create an individual submission\
    \ at any time.  Such documents are\n   typically distinguished through the use\
    \ of the author/editor's last\n   name, in the style of:\n                   \
    \        draft-<lastname>-...\n   (Also see Section 5.1 for an elaboration on\
    \ this naming.)\n   Responsibility for direct revision of a working group I-D\
    \ is assigned\n   to its editors and authors.  See Section 3 for discussion about\
    \ their\n   selection and role.\n"
- title: 1.2.  Working Group Authority and Consensus
  contents:
  - "1.2.  Working Group Authority and Consensus\n   A premise of the IETF is that,\
    \ within a working group, it is the\n   working group itself that has final authority\
    \ over the content of its\n   documents, within the constraints of the working\
    \ group's charter.  No\n   individual has special authority for the content. \
    \ The Chairs assign\n   document authors/editors and can formulate design teams,\
    \ but the\n   content of working group documents is always, ultimately, subject\
    \ to\n   working group approval.  Approval is described in terms of the IETF's\n\
    \   \"rough consensus\" construct, which is the prime example of the IETF's\n\
    \   preference for pragmatics over niceties.  Unanimous agreement is\n   always\
    \ desirable, but more approximate (rough) agreement will\n   suffice, as long\
    \ as it is clear and strong.\n   Other than for selection of document authors/editors,\
    \ as discussed in\n   Section 3, working group decision-making about document\
    \ management is\n   subject to normal IETF rough consensus rules.  Useful descriptions\
    \ of\n   this process for a working group are in Section 3.3 of [RFC2418] and\n\
    \   Section 4.2 of [Tao].  Discussion of the nature of rough consensus\n   can\
    \ be found in [Consensus].\n   In terms of the IETF's formal rough consensus processes,\
    \ the working\n   group explicitly develops, modifies, reviews, and approves document\n\
    \   content, according to overt rough consensus.  For difficult topics\n   and/or\
    \ difficult working group dynamics, this laborious process\n   really is essential.\
    \  Its diligence validates progress at each step\n   along the way.  However,\
    \ working groups often handle simpler matters\n   more simply, such as allowing\
    \ a Chair to assert the likely agreement\n   and then merely call for objections.\
    \  Ultimately, the mode of working\n   group decision-making is determined by\
    \ the comfort and engagement of\n   the working group with the way the decisions\
    \ are being made.\n   At times, a document author/editor can appear to have considerable\n\
    \   authority over content, but this is (merely) for efficiency.  That\n   is,\
    \ the Chairs can permit authors and editors to proceed with an\n   implied (default)\
    \ working group agreement, as long as the working\n   group is comfortable with\
    \ that mode.  Of course, the benefit in the\n   mode is efficiency, but its risk\
    \ is failure to retain or verify\n   actual consensus among the working group\
    \ participants.  When a\n   working group is operating in the mode of active,\
    \ direct author/\n   editor content development, an easy validation method is\
    \ simply to\n   have Chairs query the working group when a new document version\n\
    \   appears, asking for comments and concerns.\n   In general, when it is not\
    \ completely obvious what the opinion of the\n   working group is, Working Group\
    \ Chairs can poll the working group to\n   find out.  As with any other consensus\
    \ question, the form in which it\n   is asked can make a difference.  In particular,\
    \ a general 'yes/no'\n   question often is not as helpful as asking supporters\
    \ and detractors\n   of a draft -- or of the decision under consideration -- to\
    \ provide\n   their reasons, not merely their preferences.  In effect, this treats\n\
    \   the matter of consensus as an ongoing discussion.  Ideally, the\n   discussion\
    \ can produce changes in the document or in participant\n   views, or both.\n"

  contents:
  - "1.3.  Questions Considered in This Document\n   The purpose of this document\
    \ is to discuss the criteria and sequence\n   typically followed when adopting\
    \ and developing a formal IETF working\n   group document.  Therefore, this document\
    \ considers the following\n   questions that are particularly relevant to Working\
    \ Group Chairs who\n   are charged with running the process:\n   *  How do Working\
    \ Group Chairs decide which drafts to adopt and when?\n   *  Is it necessary to\
    \ poll the working group explicitly, and what\n      does a working group poll\
    \ look like?\n   *  How do Working Group Chairs make the decision?\n   *  What\
    \ are the process steps the working group will choose to use,\n      for an I-D\
    \ to become a WG I-D?\n   *  Are there any special cases?\n   *  Can a document\
    \ be created as a WG I-D from scratch?\n   *  How can competing drafts be handled?\n\

- title: 2.1.  Common Steps
  contents:
  - "2.1.  Common Steps\n   When there is interest in adopting a document as a new\
    \ working group\n   document, the Chairs often:\n   1.  Remind current draft owners\
    \ that they are transferring change\n       control for the document to the IETF.\
    \  (This is a particularly\n       significant point for a document covered by\
    \ proprietary\n       interests, because it typically entails a negotiation between\
    \ the\n       current owners and the IETF, including a formal agreement.)\n  \
    \ 2.  Check for known IPR that needs to be disclosed, using some\n       technique\
    \ like those described in [RFC6702].\n   3.  Obtain working group rough consensus.\n\
    \   4.  Choose document editors.\n   5.  Instruct authors to post the WG I-D.\n\
    \   6.  Approve posting [Approval].\n   7.  Ensure that the non-working group\
    \ version of the draft is marked\n       as being replaced by this working group\
    \ version.\n   8.  Encourage everyone to enjoy the ensuing working group\n   \
    \    discussion...\n"
- title: 2.2.  Criteria for Adoption
  contents:
  - "2.2.  Criteria for Adoption\n   No formal specification for working group 'adoption'\
    \ of a draft\n   exists; the current document is meant to provide a description\
    \ of\n   common activities for this, but again note that it is not normative.\n\
    \   There are some basic considerations when deciding to adopt a draft:\n   *\
    \  Is there a charter milestone that explicitly calls for such a\n      document?\n\
    \   *  Is the topic of the I-D within scope for the working group?\n   *  Is the\
    \ purpose of the draft sufficiently clear?\n   *  Does the document provide an\
    \ acceptable platform for continued\n      effort by the working group?\n   *\
    \  What are the process or technical objections to adoption of the\n      draft?\n\
    \   *  Is the draft likely to be completed in a timely manner?\n   *  Does the\
    \ intended status of the document seem reasonable to the\n      working group?\n\
    \   *  If not already in scope, is a simple modification to the charter\n    \
    \  feasible and warranted?\n   *  Does the draft carry known intellectual property\
    \ rights issues?\n   *  Is there strong working group support for working on the\
    \ draft?\n   Adoption has some basic pragmatics:\n      Rough consensus:  Working\
    \ group agreement to adopt is not required\n         to be unanimous [RFC2418].\n\
    \      Initial, not final:  The writing quality is not required to be\n      \
    \   \"ready for publication\", although writing quality can be a\n         problem\
    \ and does need explicit attention; although not\n         mandatory, it is good\
    \ practice to check whether a new working\n         group draft passes [IDNITS].\n\
    \      Adoption, not approval:  The document is not required to already\n    \
    \     contain a complete and/or sufficient solution, although of\n         course\
    \ this can be helpful.  Equally, adoption by a working\n         group does not\
    \ guarantee publication of the document as an RFC.\n      Group, not Chairs: \
    \ Concerning the draft, the position of the\n         Working Group Chairs has\
    \ no special authority, except to assess\n         working group consensus.\n\
    \   REMINDER:  Once a working group adopts a draft, the document is owned\n  \
    \    by the working group and can be changed however the working group\n     \
    \ decides, within the bounds of IETF process and the working group\n      charter.\
    \  Absent explicit agreement, adopting a document does not\n      automatically\
    \ mean that the working group has agreed to all of its\n      content.  So a working\
    \ group (or its charter) might explicitly\n      dictate the basis for retaining,\
    \ removing, or modifying some or\n      all of a draft's content, technical details,\
    \ or the like.\n      However, in the absence of such constraints, it is worth\
    \ having\n      the adoption process include a sub-process of gathering working\n\
    \      group concerns about the existing draft and flagging them\n      explicitly.\n"
- title: 3.  Authors/Editors
  contents:
  - "3.  Authors/Editors\n   Document authors/editors are chosen by the Working Group\
    \ Chairs.\n   Document editors are described in Section 6.3 of [RFC2418].  Authors\n\
    \   and editors are described in [RFC-Auth-Ed].\n   NOTE:  In this document, the\
    \ terms 'author' and 'editor' are meant\n      interchangeably.  Within the IETF,\
    \ the distinction between an\n      'author' and an 'editor' is, at best, subjective.\
    \  A simplistic\n      rule of thumb is that editors tend to do the mechanics\
    \ of\n      incorporating working group detail, whereas authors tend to create\n\
    \      the detail, subject to working group approval.  That is, one role\n   \
    \   is more active with the content, and the other is more passive.\n      It\
    \ is a responsibility of the Working Group Chairs to ensure that\n      document\
    \ authors make modifications in accord with working group\n      rough consensus.\
    \  Authors/editors are solely chosen by the Chairs\n      -- although the views\
    \ of the working group should be considered --\n      and are subject to replacement\
    \ for a variety of reasons, as the\n      Chairs see fit.\n   For existing documents\
    \ that are being adopted by a working group,\n   there is a special challenge\
    \ in the selection of document editors.\n   Because the document has already had\
    \ editors, the question \"Are the\n   same people appropriate for continuing the\
    \ task?\" is asked.\n   Sometimes the answer is yes, but this is not automatic.\
    \  The process\n   within an IETF working group can be quite different from the\
    \ process\n   that created previous versions.  This well might make it appropriate\n\
    \   to select one or more new editors, either as additions to the editor\n   team\
    \ or as primary pen-holders (effectively reclassifying the\n   previous team as\
    \ coauthors).\n   If the original editors are to continue in their role, the Chairs\n\
    \   might want to ensure that the editors understand IETF working group\n   process;\
    \ it is likely to be quite different from the process that\n   developed earlier\
    \ versions of the document.  If additional or new\n   editors are assigned, the\
    \ transition can be discussed, including its\n   reasons; this is best done as\
    \ soon as possible.\n"
- title: 4.  Document History and Stability
  contents:
  - "4.  Document History and Stability\n   Working group charters sometimes specify\
    \ an initial set of existing\n   documents to use as a basis of the working group's\
    \ activities.  That\n   'basis' can vary considerably, from simple input to working\
    \ group\n   discussion, all the way to an advanced draft adopted by the working\n\
    \   group and subject only to minimal changes.  The role of a document\n   should\
    \ be explicitly stated in the charter.\n   Within the scope of its charter, a\
    \ working group is free to create\n   new documents.  It is not required that\
    \ all drafts start as the\n   effort of an individual.  Of course, the criteria\
    \ for brand new\n   documents are likely to be the same as for those imported\
    \ into the\n   working group, with the additional and obvious requirement that\
    \ the\n   Working Group Chairs will need to appoint authors/editors before any\n\
    \   work can progress.  Note that, from time to time, a working group\n   will\
    \ form a design team to produce the first version of a working\n   group draft.\
    \  Design teams are discussed in Section 6.5 of [RFC2418].\n   Work that is brought\
    \ to the IETF has different levels of completeness\n   and maturity, and different\
    \ timings for having achieved those levels.\n   When the IETF charters a group\
    \ and includes existing material, the\n   charter can cast the role of that material\
    \ in very different ways.\n   It can treat it as:\n   *  no more than a set of\
    \ ideas, to be used or ignored;\n   *  a basic design, with all of the actual\
    \ details still fluid;\n   *  a rough draft, subject to extensive revision;\n\
    \   *  a solid specification that merely needs review, refinement, and\n     \
    \ maybe enhancement;\n   *  a deployed technology that is best served by trying\
    \ to protect its\n      installed base, but with some tolerance for changes that\
    \ affect\n      interoperability;\n   *  a deployed technology for which protecting\
    \ the installed base is\n      essential, including retention of core interoperability.\n\
    \   These suggest a wide range of possible constraints on working group\n   effort.\
    \  Technology is brought to the IETF at different points of\n   maturity along\
    \ its life cycle, and the nature of the technology can\n   have widely varying\
    \ utility in developing an Internet standard.\n   When technology is brand new,\
    \ with at most some prototypes done as\n   proofs of concept, then significant\
    \ changes to the specification will\n   not necessarily add much to the development\
    \ and deployment costs.\n   However, when the technology is already part of a\
    \ mature and\n   extensive operational deployment, any changes that are incompatible\n\
    \   are likely to be problematic for that market and can hinder adoption\n   of\
    \ the changes overall.  For example, immediately after the\n   development investment\
    \ is made -- and especially when there has been\n   considerable initial deployment\
    \ but there is still room for quite a\n   bit more -- the installed and potential\
    \ base might not take kindly to\n   disruptive standards work that undermines\
    \ their recent investment.\n   Conversely, even a deployed technology with a solid\
    \ base might be\n   inappropriate to deploy at Internet scale, and while a document\n\
    \   specifying such a technology might serve as a good starting point on\n   which\
    \ to base a new specification, undermining of the deployed base\n   might be completely\
    \ appropriate.\n   In reflecting upon the basis for adopting an existing draft\
    \ and the\n   way it will be used by the working group, it is important to consider\n\
    \   the document's place in its life cycle, the needs of any installed\n   base,\
    \ and the applicability of the draft's technology, when deciding\n   on the constraints\
    \ to impose on document development.  It will all\n   depend on the constraints\
    \ of the charter and the analysis of the\n   working group.\n"

    \ competing,\n   interesting proposals.  The reasons can be technical aesthetics,\n\
    \   engineering trade-offs, architectural differences, company economics,\n  \
    \ and the like.  Although it is far more comfortable to entertain only\n   one\
    \ proposal, a working group is free to pursue more than one.  Often\n   this is\
    \ necessary until a clear preference develops.  Sometimes,\n   multiple versions\
    \ are formally published, absent consensus among the\n   alternatives.\n   It\
    \ is appealing to ask authors of competing proposals to find a way\n   to merge\
    \ their work.  Where it makes sense to do this, it can produce\n   a single, strong\
    \ specification.  The detailed discussions to merge\n   are often better held\
    \ in a design team than amidst the dynamics of an\n   open working group mailing\
    \ list.  The working group has ultimate\n   authority over any decisions, but\
    \ it is not required that it be\n   involved in all the discussions.\n   On the\
    \ other hand, some differences cannot be resolved, and\n   attempting a merge\
    \ can produce a weaker result.  An example of this\n   problem of conflicting\
    \ design goals is discussed in [Heli-Sub],\n   noting:\n      \"Helicopters are\
    \ great, and so are submarines.  The problem is\n      that if you try to build\
    \ one vehicle to perform two fundamentally\n      different jobs, you're going\
    \ to get a vehicle that does neither\n      job well.\"\n   Various management\
    \ efforts can facilitate the handling of competing\n   proposals.  Some examples\
    \ include:\n   *  Developing a requirements document that is independent of specific\n\
    \      proposals; this can highlight features that are deemed essential\n    \
    \  and distinguish them from features that are of secondary\n      importance,\
    \ and can facilitate a discussion about features without\n      reference to specific\
    \ proposals.\n   *  Developing a comparison table of the proposals; this can aid\n\
    \      understanding of their differences.\n   *  Discussing the relative importance\
    \ and effects of having one\n      proposal, versus multiple; this can focus people's\
    \ efforts at\n      compromise and encourage a willingness to choose a single\n\
    \      proposal.\n   The problem of competing drafts can be particularly painful\
    \ when it\n   arises in either of two circumstances:\n   *  If a second proposal\
    \ appears as a new draft, just as the Chairs\n      were ready to poll the working\
    \ group on adoption of the draft\n      containing the first proposal, then the\
    \ authors of the first\n      proposal could feel affronted.  It does not follow\
    \ that the second\n      draft was written to be difficult or derail the first:\
    \ it might\n      even include better ideas.  So it is best not to disregard it.\n\
    \      However, automatically asking the authors to merge their work will\n  \
    \    not necessarily produce a more solid solution and will not\n      guarantee\
    \ faster progress.  This situation will be a judgement\n      call in each case,\
    \ and it might help to ask the working group for\n      their opinion: shall the\
    \ working group adopt one document as a\n      starting point and fold in the\
    \ ideas from the second under the\n      control of consensus, or shall the working\
    \ group wait until the\n      authors of both documents have reached agreement?\n\
    \   *  If the working group has already adopted an I-D on a specific\n      topic,\
    \ the posting of a new individual I-D on the same topic could\n      be seen as\
    \ an attack on the working group processes or decisions.\n      However, posting\
    \ an I-D is often a good way to put new ideas into\n      concrete form, for public\
    \ consideration and discussion.  The\n      Working Group Chairs will want to\
    \ encourage the working group to\n      consider the new proposal.  Shall it be\
    \ adopted and entirely\n      replace the current working group draft?  Shall\
    \ the new ideas be\n      incorporated into the work of the working group through\
    \ the normal\n      editorial process?  Shall the working group adopt a second\n\
    \      competing solution?  Or shall the new draft be rejected and not\n     \
    \ adopted by the working group?\n"
