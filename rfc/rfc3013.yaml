  - "1 Introduction\n   The purpose of this document is to express what the engineering\n\
    \   community as represented by the IETF expects of Internet Service\n   Providers\
    \ (ISPs) with respect to security.  This document is\n   addressed to ISPs.\n\
    \   By informing ISPs of what this community hopes and expects of them,\n   the\
    \ community hopes to encourage ISPs to become proactive in making\n   security\
    \ not only a priority, but something to which they point with\n   pride when selling\
    \ their services.\n   Under no circumstances is it the intention of this document\
    \ to\n   dictate business practices.\n   In this document we define ISPs to include\
    \ organisations in the\n   business of providing Internet connectivity or other\
    \ Internet\n   services including but not restricted to web hosting services,\n\
    \   content providers and e-mail services.  We do not include in our\n   definition\
    \ of an ISP organisations providing those services for their\n   own purposes.\n\
    \   This document is offered as a set of recommendations to ISPs\n   regarding\
    \ what security and attack management arrangements should be\n   supported, and\
    \ as advice to users regarding what they should expect\n   from a high quality\
    \ service provider.  It is in no sense normative in\n   its own right.  In time\
    \ it is likely to become dated, and other\n   expectations may arise.  However,\
    \ it does represent a snapshot of the\n   recommendations of a set of professionals\
    \ in the field at a given\n   point in the development of the Internet and its\
    \ technology.\n"

- title: 2 Communication
  contents:
  - "2 Communication\n   The community's most significant security-related expectations\
    \ of\n   ISPs relate to the availability of communication channels for dealing\n\
    \   with security incidents.\n"
- title: 2.1 Contact Information
  contents:
  - "2.1 Contact Information\n   ISPs SHOULD adhere to [RFC2142], which defines the\
    \ mailbox SECURITY\n   for network security issues, ABUSE for issues relating\
    \ to\n   inappropriate public behaviour and NOC for issues relating to network\n\
    \   infrastructure.  It also lists additional mailboxes that are defined\n   for\
    \ receiving queries and reports relating to specific services.\n   ISPs may consider\
    \ using common URLs for expanded details on the above\n   (e.g., http://www.ISP-name-here.net/security/).\n\
    \   In addition, ISPs have a duty to make sure that their contact\n   information,\
    \ in Whois, in routing registries [RFC1786] or in any\n   other repository, is\
    \ complete, accurate and reachable.\n"
- title: 2.2 Information Sharing
  contents:
  - "2.2 Information Sharing\n   ISPs SHOULD have clear policies and procedures on\
    \ the sharing of\n   information about a security incident with their customers,\
    \ with\n   other ISPs, with Incident Response Teams, with law enforcement or\n\
    \   with the press and general public.\n   ISPs should have processes in place\
    \ to deal with security incidents\n   that traverse the boundaries between them\
    \ and other ISPs.\n"
- title: 2.3 Secure Channels
  contents:
  - "2.3 Secure Channels\n   ISPs SHOULD be able to conduct such communication over\
    \ a secure\n   channel.  Note, however, that in some jurisdictions secure channels\n\
    \   might not be permitted.\n"
- title: 2.4 Notification of Vulnerabilities and Reporting of Incidents
  contents:
  - "2.4 Notification of Vulnerabilities and Reporting of Incidents\n   ISPs SHOULD\
    \ be proactive in notifying customers of security\n   vulnerabilities in the services\
    \ they provide.  In addition, as new\n   vulnerabilities in systems and software\
    \ are discovered they should\n   indicate whether their services are threatened\
    \ by these risks.\n   When security incidents occur that affect components of\
    \ an ISP's\n   infrastructure the ISP should promptly report to their customers\n\
    \      -  who is coordinating response to the incident\n      -  the vulnerability\n\
    \      -  how service was affected\n      -  what is being done to respond to\
    \ the incident\n      -  whether customer data may have been compromised\n   \
    \   -  what is being done to eliminate the vulnerability\n      -  the expected\
    \ schedule for response, assuming it can be\n         predicted\n   Many ISPs\
    \ have established procedures for notifying customers of\n   outages and service\
    \ degradation.  It is reasonable for the ISP to use\n   these channels for reporting\
    \ security-related incidents.  In such\n   cases, the customer's security point\
    \ of contact might not be the\n   person notified.  Rather, the normal point of\
    \ contact will receive\n   the report.  Customers should be aware of this and\
    \ make sure to route\n   such notifications appropriately.\n"
- title: 2.5 Incident Response and Computer Security Incident Response Teams
  contents:
  - "2.5 Incident Response and Computer Security Incident Response Teams\n   (CSIRTs)\n\
    \   A Computer Security Incident Response Team (CSIRT) is a team that\n   performs,\
    \ coordinates, and supports the response to security\n   incidents that involve\
    \ sites within a defined constituency.  The\n   Internet community's expectations\
    \ of CSIRTs are described in\n   \"Expectations for Computer Security Incident\
    \ Response\" [RFC2350].\n   Whether or not an ISP has a CSIRT, they should have\
    \ a well-advertised\n   way to receive and handle reported incidents from their\
    \ customers.\n   In addition, they should clearly document their capability to\
    \ respond\n   to reported incidents, and should indicate if there is any CSIRT\n\
    \   whose constituency would include the customer and to whom incidents\n   could\
    \ be reported.\n   Some ISPs have CSIRTs.  However it should not be assumed that\
    \ either\n   the ISP's connectivity customers or a site being attacked by a\n\
    \   customer of that ISP can automatically avail themselves of the\n   services\
    \ of the ISP's CSIRT.  ISP CSIRTs are frequently provided as\n   an added-cost\
    \ service, with the team defining as their constituency\n   only those who specifically\
    \ subscribe to (and perhaps pay for)\n   Incident Response services.\n   Thus\
    \ it's important for ISPs to publish what incident response and\n   security resources\
    \ they make available to customers, so that the\n   customers can define their\
    \ incident response escalation chain BEFORE\n   an incident occurs.\n   Customers\
    \ should find out whether their ISP has a CSIRT, and if so\n   what the charter,\
    \ policies and services of that team are.  This\n   information is best expressed\
    \ using the CSIRT template as shown in\n   Appendix D of \"Expectations for Computer\
    \ Security Incident Response\"\n   [RFC2350].\n"
- title: 3 Appropriate Use Policy
  contents:
  - "3 Appropriate Use Policy\n   Every ISP SHOULD have an Appropriate Use Policy\
    \ (AUP).\n   Whenever an ISP contracts with a customer to provide connectivity\
    \ to\n   the Internet that contract should be governed by an AUP.  The AUP\n \
    \  should be reviewed each time the contract is up for renewal, and in\n   addition\
    \ the ISP should proactively notify customers as policies are\n   updated.\n \
    \  An AUP should clearly identify what customers shall and shall not do\n   on\
    \ the various components of a system or network, including the type\n   of traffic\
    \ allowed on the networks.  The AUP should be as explicit as\n   possible to avoid\
    \ ambiguity or misunderstanding.  For example, an AUP\n   might prohibit IP spoofing.\n"
- title: 3.1 Announcement of Policy
  contents:
  - "3.1 Announcement of Policy\n   In addition to communicating their AUP to their\
    \ customers ISPs should\n   publish their policy in a public place such as their\
    \ web site so that\n   the community can be aware of what the ISP considers appropriate\
    \ and\n   can know what action to expect in the event of inappropriate\n   behaviour.\n"
- title: 3.2 Sanctions
  contents:
  - "3.2 Sanctions\n   An AUP should be clear in stating what sanctions will be enforced\
    \ in\n   the event of inappropriate behaviour.\n"
- title: 3.3 Data Protection
  contents:
  - "3.3 Data Protection\n   Many jurisdictions have Data Protection Legislation.\
    \  Where such\n   legislation applies, ISPs should consider the personal data\
    \ they hold\n   and, if necessary, register themselves as Data Controllers and\
    \ be\n   prepared to only use the data in accordance with the terms of the\n \
    \  legislation.  Given the global nature of the Internet ISPs that are\n   located\
    \ where no such legislation exists should at least familiarise\n   themselves\
    \ with the idea of Data Protection by reading a typical Data\n   Protection Act\
    \ (e.g., [DPR1998]).\n"
- title: 4 Network Infrastructure
  contents:
  - "4 Network Infrastructure\n   ISPs are responsible for managing the network infrastructure\
    \ of the\n   Internet in such a way that it is\n      -  reasonably resistant\
    \ to known security vulnerabilities\n      -  not easily hijacked by attackers\
    \ for use in subsequent attacks\n"
- title: 4.1 Registry Data Maintenance
  contents:
  - "4.1 Registry Data Maintenance\n   ISPs are commonly responsible for maintaining\
    \ the data that is stored\n   in global repositories such as the Internet Routing\
    \ Registry (IRR)\n   and the APNIC, ARIN and RIPE databases.  Updates to this\
    \ data should\n   only be possible using strong authentication.\n   ISPs should\
    \ publicly register the address space that they assign to\n   their customers\
    \ so that there is more specific contact information\n   for the delegated space.\n"
- title: 4.2 Routing Infrastructure
  contents:
  - "4.2 Routing Infrastructure\n   An ISP's ability to route traffic to the correct\
    \ destination may\n   depend on routing policy as configured in routing registries\n\
    \   [RFC1786].  If so, and if the registry supports it, they should\n   ensure\
    \ that the registry information that they maintain can only be\n   updated using\
    \ strong authentication, and that the authority to make\n   updates is appropriately\
    \ restricted.\n   Due care should also be taken in determining in whose routing\n\
    \   announcements you place greater trust when a choice of routes are\n   available\
    \ to a destination.  In the past bogus announcements have\n   resulted in traffic\
    \ being 'black holed', or worse, hijacked.\n   BGP authentication [RFC2385] SHOULD\
    \ be used with routing peers.\n"
- title: 4.3 Ingress Filtering on Source Address
  contents:
  - "4.3 Ingress Filtering on Source Address\n   The direction of such filtering is\
    \ from the edge site (customer) to\n   the Internet.\n   Attackers frequently\
    \ cover their tracks by using forged source\n   addresses.  To divert attention\
    \ from their own site the source\n   address they choose will generally be from\
    \ an innocent remote site or\n   indeed from those addresses that are allocated\
    \ for private Internets\n   [RFC1918].  In addition, forged source addresses are\
    \ frequently used\n   in spoof-based attacks in order to exploit a trust relationship\n\
    \   between hosts.\n   To reduce the incidence of attacks that rely on forged\
    \ source\n   addresses ISPs should do the following.  At the boundary router with\n\
    \   each of their customers they should proactively filter all traffic\n   coming\
    \ from the customer that has a source address of something other\n   than the\
    \ addresses that have been assigned to that customer.  For a\n   more detailed\
    \ discussion of this topic see [RFC2827].\n   There are (rare) circumstances where\
    \ ingress filtering is not\n   currently possible, for example on large aggregation\
    \ routers that\n   cannot take the additional load of applying packet filters.\
    \  In\n   addition, such filtering can cause difficulty for mobile users.\n  \
    \ Hence, while the use of this technique to prevent spoofing is\n   strongly encouraged,\
    \ it may not always be feasible.\n   In these rare cases where ingress filtering\
    \ at the interface between\n   the customer and the ISP is not possible, the customer\
    \ should be\n   encouraged to implement ingress filtering within their networks.\
    \  In\n   general filtering should be done as close to the actual hosts as\n \
    \  possible.\n"
- title: 4.4 Egress Filtering on Source Address
  contents:
  - "4.4 Egress Filtering on Source Address\n   The direction of such filtering is\
    \ from the Internet to the edge site\n   (customer).\n   There are many applications\
    \ in widespread use on the Internet today\n   that grant trust to other hosts\
    \ based only on ip address (e.g., the\n   Berkeley 'r' commands).  These are susceptible\
    \ to IP spoofing, as\n   described in [CA-95.01.IP.spoofing].  In addition, there\
    \ are\n   vulnerabilities that depend on the misuse of supposedly local\n   addresses,\
    \ such as 'land' as described in [CA-97.28.Teardrop_Land].\n   To reduce the exposure\
    \ of their customers to attacks that rely on\n   forged source addresses ISPs\
    \ should do the following.  At the\n   boundary router with each of their customers\
    \ they should proactively\n   filter all traffic going to the customer that has\
    \ a source address of\n   any of the addresses that have been assigned to that\
    \ customer.\n   The circumstances described in 4.3 in which ingress filtering\
    \ isn't\n   feasible apply similarly to egress filtering.\n"
- title: 4.5 Route Filtering
  contents:
  - "4.5 Route Filtering\n   Excessive routing updates can be leveraged by an attacker\
    \ as a base\n   load on which to build a Denial of Service attack.  At the very\
    \ least\n   they will result in performance degradation.\n   ISPs should filter\
    \ the routing announcements they hear, for example\n   to ignore routes to addresses\
    \ allocated for private Internets, to\n   avoid bogus routes and to implement\
    \ \"BGP Route Flap Dampening\"\n   [RFC2439] and aggregation policy.\n   ISPs\
    \ should implement techniques that reduce the risk of putting\n   excessive load\
    \ on routing in other parts of the network.  These\n   include 'nailed up' routes,\
    \ aggressive aggregation and route\n   dampening, all of which lower the impact\
    \ on others when your internal\n   routing changes in a way that isn't relevant\
    \ to them.\n"
- title: 4.6 Directed Broadcast
  contents:
  - "4.6 Directed Broadcast\n   The IP protocol allows for directed broadcast, the\
    \ sending of a\n   packet across the network to be broadcast on to a specific\
    \ subnet.\n   Very few practical uses for this feature exist, but several different\n\
    \   security attacks (primarily Denial of Service attacks making use of\n   the\
    \ packet multiplication effect of the broadcast) use it.\n   Therefore, routers\
    \ connected to a broadcast medium MUST NOT be\n   configured to allow directed\
    \ broadcasts onto that medium [RFC2644].\n"
- title: 5 Systems Infrastructure
  contents:
  - "5 Systems Infrastructure\n   The way an ISP manages their systems is crucial\
    \ to the security and\n   reliability of their network.  A breach of their systems\
    \ may\n   minimally lead to degraded performance or functionality, but could\n\
    \   lead to loss of data or the risk of traffic being eavesdropped (thus\n   leading\
    \ to 'man-in-the-middle' attacks).\n   It's widely accepted that it's easier to\
    \ build secure systems if\n   different services (such as mail, news and web-hosting)\
    \ are kept on\n   separate systems.\n"
- title: 5.1 System Management
  contents:
  - "5.1 System Management\n   All systems that perform critical ISP functions such\
    \ as mail, news\n   and web-hosting, should be restricted such that access to\
    \ them is\n   only available to the administrators of those services.  That access\n\
    \   should be granted only following strong authentication, and should\n   take\
    \ place over an encrypted link.  Only the ports on which those\n   services listen\
    \ should be reachable from outside of the ISP's systems\n   networks.\n   ISPs\
    \ should stay up to date for more secure methods of providing\n   services as\
    \ they become available (e.g., IMAP/POP AUTHorize Extension\n   for Simple Challenge/Response,\
    \ [RFC2195]).\n"
- title: 5.2 No Systems on Transit Networks
  contents:
  - "5.2 No Systems on Transit Networks\n   Systems should not be attached to transit\
    \ network segments.\n"
- title: 5.3 Open Mail Relay
  contents:
  - "5.3 Open Mail Relay\n   ISPs should take active steps to prevent their mail infrastructure\n\
    \   from being used by 'spammers' to inject Unsolicited Bulk E-mail (UBE)\n  \
    \ while hiding the sender's identity [RFC2505].  While not all\n   preventive\
    \ steps are appropriate for every site, the most effective\n   site-appropriate\
    \ methods should be used.\n   ISPs should also strongly encourage their customers\
    \ to take the\n   necessary steps to prevent this activity on their own systems.\n"
- title: 5.4 Message Submission
  contents:
  - "5.4 Message Submission\n   Message submissions should be authenticated using\
    \ the AUTH SMTP\n   service extension as described in the \"SMTP Service Extension\
    \ for\n   Authentication\" [RFC2554].\n   SMTP AUTH is preferred over IP address-based\
    \ submission restrictions\n   in that it gives the ISP's customers the flexibility\
    \ of being able to\n   submit mail even when not connected through the ISP's network\
    \ (for\n   example, while at work), is more resistant to spoofing, and can be\n\
    \   upgraded to newer authentication mechanisms as they become available.\n  \
    \ In addition, to facilitate the enforcement of security policy, it is\n   strongly\
    \ recommended that messages be submitted using the MAIL SUBMIT\n   port (587)\
    \ as discussed in \"Message Submission\" [RFC2476], rather\n   than through the\
    \ SMTP port (25).  In this way the SMTP port (25) can\n   be restricted to local\
    \ delivery only.\n   The reason for this is to be able to differentiate between\
    \ inbound\n   local delivery and relay (i.e., allow customers to send email via\
    \ the\n   ISP's SMTP service to arbitrary receivers on the Internet).  Non-\n\
    \   authenticated SMTP should only be allowed for local delivery.\n   As more\
    \ and more mail clients support both SMTP AUTH and the message\n   submission\
    \ port (either explicitly or by configuring the SMTP port),\n   ISPs may find\
    \ it useful to require that customers submit messages\n   using both the submission\
    \ port and SMTP AUTH; permitting only inbound\n   mail on port 25.\n   These measures\
    \ (SMTP AUTH and the submission port) not only protect\n   the ISP from serving\
    \ as a UBE injection point via third-party relay,\n   but also help in tracking\
    \ accountability for message submission in\n   the case where a customer sends\
    \ UBE.\n"
