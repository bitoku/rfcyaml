  - "1. Introduction\n   The keywords MUST, MUST NOT, REQUIRED, SHALL, SHALL NOT,\
    \ SHOULD,\n   SHOULD NOT, RECOMMENDED, MAY, and OPTIONAL, when they appear in\
    \ this\n   document, are to be interpreted as described in [6].\n   ATMARP defines\
    \ an initial application of classical IP and ARP in an\n   ATM network environment\
    \ configured as a LIS[1].  ATMARP only\n   considers application of ATM as a direct\
    \ replacement for the \"wires\"\n   and local LAN segments connecting IP end-stations\
    \ and routers\n   operating in the \"classical\" LAN-based paradigm.\n   The NBMA\
    \ Next Hop Resolution Protocol (NHRP) allows a source station\n   (a host or router),\
    \ wishing to communicate over a Non-Broadcast,\n   Multi-Access (NBMA) subnetwork,\
    \ to determine the internetworking\n   layer addresses and NBMA addresses of suitable\
    \ \"NBMA next hops\"\n   toward a destination station. If the destination is connected\
    \ to the\n   NBMA subnetwork and direct communication is administratively allowed,\n\
    \   then the NBMA next hop is the destination station itself.  Otherwise,\n  \
    \ the NBMA next hop is the egress router from the NBMA subnetwork that\n   is\
    \ \"nearest\" to the destination station.  For the purposes of this\n   document,\
    \ the NBMA network is of type ATM.\n   It is reasonable to expect that ATMARP\
    \ Clients and NHRP Clients will\n   initially coexist within a LIS.  Thus, it\
    \ is necessary to define a\n   graceful transition, including a period of coexistance,\
    \ from the use\n   of ATMARP to the use of NHRP for address resolution in the\
    \ LIS\n   [1][2]. In short, NHSs will be required to respond to ATMARP Client\n\
    \   queries in a fashion which will permit continued use of the ATMARP\n   Client\
    \ within the LIS during the ATMARP to NHRP transition period.\n   Note that this\
    \ document places no protocol requirements upon\n   ATMARP[1] servers.\n   For\
    \ the following, it will be assumed that the reader is familiar\n   with the terminology\
    \ as described in [1][2][3].\n"
- title: 2. Service Requirements
  contents:
  - "2. Service Requirements\n   If NHRP is to be used in a LIS then only NHSs will\
    \ be used in the\n   LIS; that is, there will not be a mixture of NHSs and ATMARP\
    \ servers\n   within the same LIS.  Since ATMARP servers will not be able to\n\
    \   understand NHCs and since, as described below, NHSs will respond to\n   ATMARP\
    \ Clients, this is a reasonable simplifying restriction.\n   This document will\
    \ only address SVC based environments and will not\n   address PVC environments.\
    \  This document will refer only to ATM AAL5\n   as the NBMA and IP as the protocol\
    \ layer since ATMARP only addresses\n   these protocols.\n"
- title: 2.1 NHRP Server Requirements
  contents:
  - "2.1 NHRP Server Requirements\n   If NHRP Servers (NHS) are to be deployed in\
    \ a LIS which contains both\n   ATMARP Clients and NHRP Clients then NHSs MUST\
    \ respond to\n   ATMARP_Requests sent by ATMARP Clients in the same fashion that\
    \ an\n   ATMARP Server would respond as described in [1].  To do this, the NHS\n\
    \   MUST first recognize the LLC/SNAP ATMARP code point with LLC=0xAA-\n   AA-03,\
    \ OUI=0x00-00-00, and ethertype=0x08-06.  Further, the NHS MUST\n   recognize\
    \ the packet formats described in Section 8.7 of [1].\n   However, since this\
    \ document does not extend to PVC environments,\n   NHSs MUST only receive/respond\
    \ to values of ar$op of 1,2,10\n   (Decimal).  If an NHS receives an ATMARP message\
    \ with ar$op values\n   other than those previously noted then the NHS MUST discard\
    \ the\n   packet and MUST NOT take any further action.\n   When an NHS receives\
    \ a valid (as defined in the previous paragraph)\n   ATMARP_Request packet, the\
    \ NHS MUST follow the rules described in\n   Section 8.4 of [1] with the following\
    \ additional processing:\n     1) When an ATMARP_Request causes a new table entry\
    \ in the NHS for\n        an ATMARP Client, that table entry MUST be marked as\
    \ being of\n        type \"ATMARP\" so that it can be differentiated from an NHRP\n\
    \        sourced entry.\n     2) An ATMARP_Request MUST NOT cause an ATMARP_Reply\
    \ to be sent if\n        that ATMARP_Request contains an off-LIS protocol address.\
    \  This\n        should never happen because the IP stack on the requesting\n\
    \        machine should automatically send the packet to the default\n       \
    \ router.  If this does occur then the ATMARP_Request MUST cause\n        an ATMARP_NAK\
    \ to be sent to the originator.\n   In [1], an ATMARP_Request packet also serves\
    \ as a\n   registraion/registration-update packet which would cause a server to\n\
    \   add an entry to a server's cache or to update a previously existing\n   entry.\
    \  When an NHS receives an ATMARP_Request which causes the\n   creation of a new\
    \ cache entry in the NHS or updates an existing entry\n   then that cache entry\
    \ will have a holding time of 20 minutes (this is\n   the default value in [1]).\n\
    \   An NHS receiving an NHRP Resolution Request MUST NOT send a positive\n   NHRP\
    \ Resolution Reply for a station which registered via ATMARP if\n   the station\
    \ sending the NHRP Resolution Request is outside the LIS of\n   the station which\
    \ registered itself via ATMARP.  This is because the\n   station which registered\
    \ via ATMARP is almost certainly not prepared\n   to accept a cut-through.   When\
    \ this occurs, the replying NHS must\n   send NHRP Resolution Reply which contains\
    \ a CIE code of \"4 -\n   Administratively Prohibited\" as described in [2]. \
    \ This type of reply\n   does not preclude the station sending the NHRP Resolution\
    \ Request\n   from sending its data packets along the routed path but it does\n\
    \   preclude that station from setting up a cut-through VC.\n"
- title: 2.2 Multi-server environments
  contents:
  - "2.2 Multi-server environments\n   Since NHRP servers may work in a multi-server\
    \ environment on a per\n   LIS basis during the transition, it is necessary to\
    \ know how cache\n   synchronization occurs. These rules may be found in [5].\n"
- title: 3. Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "3. Security Considerations\n   Not all of the security issues relating to IP\
    \ over ATM are clearly\n   understood at this time, due to the fluid state of\
    \ ATM\n   specifications, newness of the technology, and other factors.\n   It\
    \ is believed that ATM and IP facilities for authenticated call\n   management,\
    \ authenticated end-to-end communications, and data\n   encryption will be needed\
    \ in globally connected ATM networks.  Such\n   future security facilities and\
    \ their use by IP networks are beyond\n   the scope of this memo.\n   There are\
    \ known security issues relating to host impersonation via\n   the address resolution\
    \ protocols used in the Internet [4].  No\n   special security mechanisms have\
    \ been added to ATMARP.  While NHRP\n   supplies some mechanisms for authentication,\
    \ ATMARP does not.  Since\n   any security mechanism is only as good as its weakest\
    \ link, it should\n   be assumed that when NHRP and ATMARP exist with a given\
    \ LIS, the\n   security of a combination is only as good as that supplied by ATMARP.\n"
