  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   Procedures for the measurement of packet loss, delay, and\
    \ throughput\n   in MPLS networks are defined in [RFC6374].  This document describes\
    \ a\n   profile, i.e., a simplified subset, of these procedures that suffices\n\
    \   to meet the specific requirements of MPLS-based transport networks\n   [RFC5921]\
    \ as defined in [RFC5860].  This profile is presented for the\n   convenience\
    \ of implementors who are concerned exclusively with the\n   transport network\
    \ context.\n   The use of the profile specified in this document is purely optional.\n\
    \   Implementors wishing to provide enhanced functionality that is within\n  \
    \ the scope of [RFC6374] but outside the scope of this profile may do\n   so,\
    \ whether or not the implementation is restricted to the transport\n   network\
    \ context.\n   The assumption of this profile is that the devices involved in\
    \ a\n   measurement operation are configured for measurement by a means\n   external\
    \ to the measurement protocols themselves, for example, via a\n   Network Management\
    \ System (NMS) or separate configuration protocol.\n   The manageability considerations\
    \ in [RFC6374] apply, and further\n   information on MPLS-TP network management\
    \ can be found in [RFC5950].\n   This document is a product of a joint Internet\
    \ Engineering Task Force\n   (IETF) / International Telecommunication Union Telecommunication\n\
    \   Standardization Sector (ITU-T) effort to include an MPLS Transport\n   Profile\
    \ within the IETF MPLS and Pseudowire Emulation Edge-to-Edge\n   (PWE3) architectures\
    \ to support the capabilities and functionalities\n   of a packet transport network\
    \ as defined by the ITU-T.\n"

  contents:
  - "2.  MPLS-TP Measurement Considerations\n   The measurement considerations discussed\
    \ in Section 2.9 of [RFC6374]\n   apply also in the context of MPLS-TP, except\
    \ for the following, which\n   pertain to topologies excluded from MPLS-TP:\n\
    \   o  Equal Cost Multipath considerations (Section 2.9.4 of [RFC6374])\n   o\
    \  Considerations for direct Loss Measurement (LM) in the presence of\n      Label\
    \ Switched Paths constructed via the Label Distribution\n      Protocol (LDP)\
