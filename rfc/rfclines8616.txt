Abstract Sender Policy Framework (SPF) (RFC 7208), DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM) (RFC 6376), and Domain based Message Authentication, Reporting, and Conformance (DMARC) (RFC 7489) enable a domain owner to publish email authentication and policy information in the DNS.
In internationalized email, domain names can occur both as U labels and A labels.
This specification updates the SPF, DKIM, and DMARC specifications to clarify which form of internationalized domain names to use in those specifications.
Introduction SPF [RFC7208], DKIM [RFC6376], and DMARC [RFC7489] enable a domain owner to publish email authentication and policy information in the DNS.
SPF primarily publishes information about what host addresses are authorized to send mail for a domain.
DKIM places cryptographic signatures on email messages, with the validation keys published in the DNS.
DMARC publishes policy information related to the domain in the From: header field of email messages.
In conventional email, all domain names are ASCII in all contexts, so there is no question about the representation of the domain names.
All internationalized domain names are represented as A labels [RFC5890] in message header fields, SMTP sessions, and the DNS.
[RFC6530] (generally called "EAI" for Email Address Internationalization) allows U labels in SMTP sessions [RFC6531] and message header fields
Every U label is equivalent to an A label, so in principle, the choice of label format will not cause ambiguities.
But in practice, consistent use of label formats will make it more likely that code for mail senders and receivers interoperates.
Internationalized mail also allows UTF 8 encoded Unicode characters in the local parts of mailbox names, which were historically only ASCII.
The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14
when, and only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here.
The term "IDN", for Internationalized Domain Name, refers to a domain name containing either U labels or A labels.
Since DMARC is not currently a Standards Track protocol, this specification offers advice rather than requirements for DMARC.
In headers in EAI mail messages, domain names that were restricted to ASCII can be U labels, and mailbox local parts can be UTF 8.
Header field names and other text intended primarily to be interpreted by computers rather than read by people remains ASCII.
Strings stored in DNS records remain ASCII since there is no way to tell whether a client retrieving a DNS record expects an EAI or an ASCII result.
When a domain name found in a mail header field includes U labels, those labels are translated to A labels before being looked up in the DNS, as described in [RFC5891].
SPF [RFC7208] uses two identities from the SMTP session:
the host name in the EHLO command and the domain in the address in the MAIL FROM command.
Since the EHLO command precedes the server response that tells whether the server supports the SMTPUTF8 extension, an IDN host name MUST be represented as A labels.
An IDN in MAIL FROM can be either U labels or A labels.
All U labels MUST be converted to A labels before being used for an SPF validation.
This includes both the labels in the name used for the original DNS lookup, described in Section 3 of [RFC7208], and those used in the macro expansion of domain spec, described in Section 7.
Section 4.3 of [RFC7208] states that all IDNs in an SPF DNS record MUST be A labels; this rule is unchanged since any SPF record can be used to authorize either EAI or conventional mail.
SPF macros %{s} and %{l} expand the local part of the sender's mailbox.
If the local part contains non ASCII characters, terms that include %{s} or %{l} do not match anything, because non ASCII local parts cannot be used as the DNS labels the macros are intended to match.
Since these macros are rarely used, this is unlikely to be an issue in practice.
DKIM and Internationalized Mail DKIM [RFC6376] specifies a mail header field that contains a cryptographic message signature and a DNS record that contains the validation key.
Section 2.11 of [RFC6376] defines dkim quoted printable.
Its definition is modified in messages with internationalized header fields so that non ASCII
UTF 8 characters need not be quoted.
The ABNF [RFC5234] for dkim safe char in those messages is replaced by the following, adding non ASCII UTF 8 characters from [RFC3629]:
/ %x3E 7E / UTF8 2
> Section 3.5 of [RFC6376] states that IDNs in the d , i , and s  tags of a DKIM Signature header field MUST be encoded as A labels.
This rule is relaxed only for internationalized message header fields [RFC6532], so IDNs SHOULD be represented as U labels.
This provides improved consistency with other header fields.
(A labels remain valid to allow a transition from older software.)
The set of allowable characters in the local part of an i
tag is extended in the same fashion as local parts of email addresses as described in Section 3.2 of [RFC6532].
When computing or verifying the hash in a DKIM signature as described in Section 3.7 of [RFC6376], the hash MUST use the domain name in the format it occurs in the header field.
Section 3.4.2 of [RFC6376] describes relaxed header canonicalization.
Its first step converts all header field names from uppercase to lowercase.
Field names are restricted to printable ASCII (see [RFC5322], Section 3.6.8), so this case conversion remains ASCII case conversion.
DKIM key records, described in Section 3.6.1 of [RFC6376], do not contain domain names, so there is no change to their specification.
DMARC and Internationalized Mail DMARC [RFC7489] defines a policy language that domain owners can specify for the domain of the address in an RFC5322.From header field.
Section 6.6.1 of [RFC7489] specifies, somewhat imprecisely, how IDNs in the RFC5322.From address domain are to be handled.
That section is updated to say that all U labels in the domain are converted to A labels before further processing.
Section 7.1 of [RFC7489] is similarly updated to say that all U labels in domains being handled are converted to A labels before further processing.
DMARC policy records, described in Sections 6.3 and 7.1 of [RFC7489], can contain email addresses in the "rua" and "ruf" tags.
Since a policy record can be used for both internationalized and conventional mail, those addresses still have to be conventional addresses, not internationalized addresses.
This document has no IANA actions.
Security Considerations Email is subject to a vast range of threats and abuses.
This document attempts to slightly mitigate some of them but does not, as far as the author knows, add any new ones.
The updates to SPF, DKIM, and DMARC are intended to allow the respective specifications to work as reliably on internationalized mail as they do on ASCII mail, so that applications that use them, such as some kinds of mail filters that catch spam and phish, can work more reliably on internationalized mail.
