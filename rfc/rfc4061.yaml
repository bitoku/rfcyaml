- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   There is a growing interest in routing protocol convergence\
    \ testing,\n   with many people looking at various tests to determine how long\
    \ it\n   takes for a network to converge after various conditions occur.  The\n\
    \   major problem with this sort of testing is that the framework of the\n   tests\
    \ has a major impact on the results; for instance, determining\n   when a network\
    \ is converged, what parts of the router's operation are\n   considered within\
    \ the testing, and other such things will have a\n   major impact on the apparent\
    \ performance that routing protocols\n   provide.\n   This document attempts to\
    \ provide a framework for Open Shortest Path\n   First [OSPF] performance testing,\
    \ and to provide some tests for\n   measuring some aspects of OSPF performance.\
    \  The motivation of the\n   document is to provide a set of tests that can provide\
    \ the user\n   comparable data from various vendors with which to evaluate the\
    \ OSPF\n   protocol performance on the devices.\n"
- title: 2.  Specification of Requirements
  contents:
  - "2.  Specification of Requirements\n   The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"\
    REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\"\
    , \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n   document are to be interpreted as described\
    \ in [RFC2119].  RFC 2119\n   key words in this document are used to ensure methodological\
    \ control,\n   which is very important in the specification of benchmarks.  This\n\
    \   document does not specify a network-related protocol.\n"
- title: 3.  Overview and Scope
  contents:
  - "3.  Overview and Scope\n   Although this document describes a specific set of\
    \ tests aimed at\n   characterizing the single router control plane convergence\n\
    \   performance of OSPF processes in routers or other boxes that\n   incorporate\
    \ OSPF functionality, a key objective is to propose\n   methodologies that produce\
    \ directly comparable convergence-related\n   measurements.\n   The following\
    \ considerations are outside the scope of this document:\n   o  The interactions\
    \ of convergence and forwarding; testing is\n      restricted to events occurring\
    \ within the control plane.\n      Forwarding performance is the primary focus\
    \ in [INTERCONNECT], and\n      it is expected to be dealt with in work that ensues\
    \ from [FIB-\n      TERM].\n   o  Inter-area route generation, AS-external route\
    \ generation, and\n      simultaneous traffic on the control and data paths within\
    \ the DUT.\n      Although the tests outlined in this document measure SPF time,\n\
    \      flooding times, and other aspects of OSPF convergence performance,\n  \
    \    this document does not provide tests for measuring external or\n      summary\
    \ route generation, route translation, or other OSPF inter-\n      area and external\
    \ routing performance.  These areas are expected\n      to be dealt with in a\
    \ later document.\n      The tests should be run more than once, since a single\
    \ test run\n      cannot be relied on to produce statistically sound results.\
    \  The\n      number of test runs and any variations between the tests should\
    \ be\n      recorded in the test results (see [TERM] for more information on\n\
    \      what items should be recorded in the test results).\n"
- title: 4.  Reference Topologies
  contents:
  - "4.  Reference Topologies\n   Several reference topologies that are used throughout\
    \ the tests are\n   described in the remaining sections of this document.  All\
    \ of the\n   topologies have been collectively placed in one section to avoid\n\
    \   repetition.\n   o  Reference Topology 1 (Emulated Topology)\n            \
    \               (                   )\n      DUT----Generator----(  emulated topology\
    \  )\n                           (                   )\n      A simple back-to-back\
    \ configuration.  It's assumed that the link\n      between the generator and\
    \ the DUT is a point-to-point link, while\n      the connections within the generator\
    \ represent some emulated\n      topology.\n   o  Reference Topology 2 (Generator\
    \ and Collector)\n                                        (                  \

    \      All routers are connected through point-to-point links.  The cost\n   \
    \   of all links is assumed to be the same unless otherwise noted.\n   o  Reference\
    \ Topology 3 (Broadcast Network)\n      DUT     R1     R2\n       |      |   \
    \   |\n      -+------+------+-----.....\n      Any number of routers could be\
    \ included on the common broadcast\n      network.\n   o  Reference Topology 4\

    \ 2)-----/           (                   )\n   In all cases the tests and topologies\
    \ are designed to allow\n   performance measurements to be taken all on a single\
    \ device, whether\n   this is the DUT or some other device in the network.  This\
    \ eliminates\n   the need for synchronized clocks within the test networks.\n"
- title: 5.  Basic Performance Tests
  contents:
  - "5.  Basic Performance Tests\n   These tests will measure aspects of the OSPF\
    \ implementation as a\n   process on the device under test, including\n   o  time\
    \ required to process an LSA,\n   o  flooding time, and\n   o  Shortest Path First\
    \ computation.\n"
- title: 5.1.  Time Required to Process an LSA
  contents:
  - "5.1.  Time Required to Process an LSA\n   o  Using reference topology 1 (Emulated\
    \ Topology), begin with all\n      links up and a full adjacency established between\
    \ the DUT and the\n      generator.\n      Note: The generator does not have direct\
    \ knowledge of the state of\n      the adjacency on the DUT.  The fact that the\
    \ adjacency may be in\n      Full state on the generator does not mean that the\
    \ DUT is ready.\n      It may still (and is likely to) be requesting LSAs from\
    \ the\n      generator.  This process, involving processing of requested LSAs,\n\
    \      will affect the results of the test.  The generator should either\n   \
    \   wait until it sees the DUT's router-LSA listing the adjacency with\n     \
    \ the generator or introduce a configurable delay before starting\n      the test.\n\
    \   o  Send an LSA that is already in the DUT (a duplicate LSA), note the\n  \
    \    time difference between when the LSA is sent and when the ack is\n      received.\
    \  This measures the time taken to propagate the LSA and\n      the ack, as well\
    \ as the processing time of the duplicate LSA.\n      This is dupLSAprocTime.\n\
    \   o  Send a new LSA from the generator to the DUT, followed immediately\n  \
    \    by a duplicate LSA (LSA that already resides in the database of\n      DUT,\
    \ but not the same as the one just sent).\n   o  The DUT will acknowledge this\
    \ second LSA immediately; note the\n      time of this acknowledgement.  This\
    \ is newLSAprocTime.\n      The amount of time required for an OSPF implementation\
    \ to process\n      the new LSA can be computed by subtracting dupLSAprocTime\
    \ from\n      newLSAprocTime.\n      Note: The duplicate LSA cannot be the same\
    \ as the one just sent\n      because of the MinLSInterval restriction [OSPF].\
    \  This test is\n      taken from [BLACKBOX].\n      Note: This time may or may\
    \ not include the time required to\n      perform flooding-related operations,\
    \ depending on when the\n      implementation sends the ack: before it floods\
    \ the LSA further, or\n      after it does, or anywhere in between.  In other\
    \ words, this\n      measurement may not mean the same thing in all implementations.\n"
- title: 5.2.  Flooding Time
  contents:
  - "5.2.  Flooding Time\n   o  Using reference topology 2 (Generator and Collector),\
    \ enable OSPF\n      on all links and allow the devices to build full adjacencies.\n\
    \      Configure the collector so that it will block all flooding toward\n   \
    \   the DUT (but so that it continues receiving advertisements from\n      the\
    \ DUT).\n   o  Inject a new set of LSAs from the generator toward the collector\n\
    \      and the DUT.\n   o  On the collector, note the time the flooding is complete\
    \ across\n      the link to the generator.  Also note the time the flooding is\n\
    \      complete across the link from the DUT.\n   The time from when the last\
    \ LSA is received on the collector from the\n   generator to when the last LSA\
    \ is received on the collector from the\n   DUT should be measured during this\
    \ test.  This time is important in\n   link state protocols, since the loop-free\
    \ nature of the network is\n   reliant on the speed at which revised topology\
    \ information is\n   flooded.\n   Depending on the number of LSAs flooded, the\
    \ sizes of the LSAs, the\n   number of LSUs, and the rate of flooding, these numbers\
    \ could vary by\n   some amount.  The settings and variances of these numbers\
    \ should be\n   reported with the test results.\n"
- title: 5.3.  Shortest Path First Computation Time
  contents:
  - "5.3.  Shortest Path First Computation Time\n   o  Use reference topology 1 (Emulated\
    \ Topology), beginning with the\n      DUT and the generator fully adjacent.\n\
    \   o  The default SPF timer on the DUT should be set to 0 so that any\n     \
    \ new LSA that arrives immediately results in the SPF calculation\n      [BLACKBOX].\n\
    \   o  The generator should inject a set of LSAs toward the DUT; the DUT\n   \
    \   should be allowed to converge and install all best paths in the\n      local\
    \ routing table, etc.\n   o  Send an LSA that is already in the DUT (a duplicate\
    \ LSA), note the\n      time difference between when the LSA is sent and when\
    \ the ack is\n      received.  This measures the time taken to propagate the LSA\
    \ and\n      the ack, as well as the processing time of the duplicate LSA.\n \
    \     This is dupLSAprocTime.\n   o  Change the link cost between the generator\
    \ and the emulated\n      network it is advertising, and transmit the new LSA\
    \ to the DUT.\n   o  Immediately inject another LSA that is a duplicate of some\
    \ other\n      LSA the generator has previously injected (preferably a stub\n\
    \      network someplace within the emulated network).\n      Note: The generator\
    \ should make sure that outbound LSA packing is\n      not performed for the duplicate\
    \ LSAs and that they are always sent\n      in a separate Link-state Update packet.\
    \  Otherwise, if the LSA\n      carrying the topology change and the duplicate\
    \ LSA are in the same\n      packet, the SPF starts after the duplicate LSA is\
    \ acked.\n   o  Measure the time between transmitting the second (duplicate) LSA\n\
    \      and the acknowledgement for that LSA; this is the totalSPFtime.\n     \
    \ The total time required to run SPF can be computed by subtracting\n      dupLSAprocTime\
    \ from totalSPFtime.\n   The accuracy of this test is crucially dependent on the\
    \ amount of\n   time between the transmissions of the first and second LSAs. \
    \ If too\n   much time elapsed, the test is meaningless because the SPF run will\n\
    \   complete before the second (duplicate) LSA is received.  If the time\n   elapsed\
    \ is less, then both LSAs will be handled before the SPF run is\n   scheduled\
    \ and started, and thus the measurement would only be for the\n   handling of\
    \ the duplicate LSA.\n   This test is also specified in [BLACKBOX].\n   Note:\
    \ This test may not be accurate on systems that implement OSPF as\n   a multithreaded\
    \ process, where the flooding takes place in a separate\n   process (or on a different\
    \ processor) than shortest path first\n   computations.\n   It is also possible\
    \ to measure the SPF time using white box tests\n   (using output supplied by\
    \ the OSPF software implementer), such as the\n   following:\n   o  Using reference\
    \ topology 1 (Emulated Topology), establish a full\n      adjacency between the\
    \ generator and the DUT.\n   o  Inject a set of LSAs from the generator toward\
    \ the DUT.  Allow the\n      DUT to stabilize and install all best paths in the\
    \ routing table,\n      etc.\n   o  Change the link cost between the DUT and the\
    \ generator (or the\n      link between the generator and the emulated network\
    \ it is\n      advertising), such that a full SPF is required to run, although\n\
    \      only one piece of information is changed.\n   o  Measure the amount of\
    \ time required for the DUT to compute a new\n      shortest path tree as a result\
    \ of the topology changes injected by\n      the generator.  These measurements\
    \ should be taken using available\n      show and debug information on the DUT.\n\
    \   Several caveats MUST be mentioned when a white box method of\n   measuring\
    \ SPF time is used.  For instance, such white box tests are\n   only applicable\
    \ when testing various versions or variations within a\n   single implementation\
    \ of the OSPF protocol.  Further, the same set of\n   commands MUST be used in\
    \ each iteration of such a test to ensure\n   consistent results.\n   There is\
    \ an interesting relationship between the SPF times reported\n   by white box\
    \ (internal) testing and black box (external) testing;\n   each of these two types\
    \ of tests may be used as a \"sanity check\" on\n   the other by comparing results.\n\

    \ with OSPF enabled.  OSPF should be\n      enabled on R1, but the broadcast link\

    \  Note the time\n      of the first hello received by R1.\n   o  Note the time\

    \ between the first hello and the first network LSA\n      is the time required\
    \ by the DUT to converge on this new topology.\n   This test assumes that the\
    \ DUT will be the designated router on the\n   broadcast link.  A similar test\
    \ could be designed to test the\n   convergence time when the DUT is not the designated\
    \ router.\n   This test maybe performed with a varying number of devices attached\n\
    \   to the broadcast network, and with varying sets of LSAs being\n   advertised\
    \ to the DUT from the routers attached to the broadcast\n   network.  Variations\
    \ in the LSA sets and other factors should be\n   noted in the test results.\n\
    \   The time required to elect a designated router, as measured in\n   Section\
    \ 6.4, above, may be subtracted from the results of this test\n   to provide just\
    \ the convergence time across a broadcast network.\n   Note that although all\
    \ the other tests in this document include route\n   calculation time in the convergence\
    \ time, as described in [TERM],\n   this test may not include route calculation\
    \ time in the resulting\n   measured convergence time, because initial route calculation\
    \ may\n   occur after the first network LSA is flooded.\n"
