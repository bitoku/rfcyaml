  - "1.  Introduction\n   The standardization of network configuration interfaces\
    \ for use with\n   the Network Configuration Protocol (NETCONF) [RFC4741] requires\
    \ a\n   modular set of data models, which can be reused and extended over\n  \
    \ time.\n   This document defines a set of usage guidelines for Standards Track\n\
    \   documents containing YANG [RFC6020] data models.  YANG is used to\n   define\
    \ the data structures, protocol operations, and notification\n   content used\
    \ within a NETCONF server.  A server that supports a\n   particular YANG module\
    \ will support client NETCONF operation\n   requests, as indicated by the specific\
    \ content defined in the YANG\n   module.\n   This document is similar to the\
    \ Structure of Management Information\n   version 2 (SMIv2) usage guidelines specification\
    \ [RFC4181] in intent\n   and structure.  However, since that document was written\
    \ a decade\n   after SMIv2 modules had been in use, it was published as a 'Best\n\
    \   Current Practice' (BCP).  This document is not a BCP, but rather an\n   informational\
    \ reference, intended to promote consistency in documents\n   containing YANG\
    \ modules.\n   Many YANG constructs are defined as optional to use, such as the\n\
    \   description statement.  However, in order to maximize\n   interoperability\
    \ of NETCONF implementations utilizing YANG data\n   models, it is desirable to\
    \ define a set of usage guidelines that may\n   require a higher level of compliance\
    \ than the minimum level defined\n   in the YANG specification.\n   In addition,\
    \ YANG allows constructs such as infinite length\n   identifiers and string values,\
    \ or top-level mandatory nodes, that a\n   compliant server is not required to\
    \ support.  Only constructs that\n   all servers are required to support can be\
    \ used in IETF YANG modules.\n   This document defines usage guidelines related\
    \ to the NETCONF\n   operations layer and NETCONF content layer, as defined in\
    \ [RFC4741].\n   These guidelines are intended to be used by authors and reviewers\
    \ to\n   improve the readability and interoperability of published YANG data\n\
    \   models.\n"

  contents:
  - "3.1.  Module Copyright\n   The module description statement MUST contain a reference\
    \ to the\n   latest approved IETF Trust Copyright statement, which is available\n\
    \   online at:\n   http://trustee.ietf.org/license-info/\n   Each YANG module\
    \ or submodule contained within an Internet-Draft or\n   RFC is considered to\
    \ be a code component.  The strings '<CODE\n   BEGINS>' and '<CODE ENDS>' MUST\
    \ be used to identify each code\n   component.\n   The '<CODE BEGINS>' tag SHOULD\
    \ be followed by a string identifying\n   the file name specified in Section 5.2\
    \ of [RFC6020].  The following\n   example is for the '2010-01-18' revision of\
    \ the 'ietf-foo' module:\n   <CODE BEGINS> file \"ietf-foo@2010-01-18.yang\"\n\

    \   }\n   <CODE ENDS>\n"
- title: 3.2.  Narrative Sections
  contents:
  - "3.2.  Narrative Sections\n   The narrative part MUST include an overview section\
    \ that describes\n   the scope and field of application of the module(s) defined\
    \ by the\n   specification and that specifies the relationship (if any) of these\n\
    \   modules to other standards, particularly to standards containing\n   other\
    \ YANG modules.  The narrative part SHOULD include one or more\n   sections to\
    \ briefly describe the structure of the modules defined in\n   the specification.\n\
    \   If the module(s) defined by the specification imports definitions\n   from\
    \ other modules (except for those defined in the YANG [RFC6020] or\n   YANG Types\
    \ [RFC6021] documents), or are always implemented in\n   conjunction with other\

- title: 3.4.  Security Considerations Section
  contents:
  - "3.4.  Security Considerations Section\n   Each specification that defines one\
    \ or more modules MUST contain a\n   section that discusses security considerations\
    \ relevant to those\n   modules.\n   This section MUST be patterned after the\
    \ latest approved template\n   (available at\n   http://www.ops.ietf.org/netconf/yang-security-considerations.txt).\n\
    \   Section 6.1 contains the security considerations template dated\n   2010-06-16.\

    \ section.  The requirements for this section vary\n   depending on what actions\
    \ are required of the IANA.  If there are no\n   IANA considerations applicable\
    \ to the document, then the IANA\n   Considerations section stating that there\

- title: 3.5.1.  Documents that Create a New Namespace
  contents:
  - "3.5.1.  Documents that Create a New Namespace\n   If an Internet-Draft defines\
    \ a new namespace that is to be\n   administered by the IANA, then the document\
    \ MUST include an IANA\n   Considerations section that specifies how the namespace\
    \ is to be\n   administered.\n   Specifically, if any YANG module namespace statement\
    \ value contained\n   in the document is not already registered with IANA, then\
    \ a new YANG\n   Namespace registry entry MUST be requested from the IANA.  The\
    \ YANG\n   [RFC6020] specification includes the procedure for this purpose in\n\
    \   its IANA Considerations section.\n"
- title: 3.5.2.  Documents that Extend an Existing Namespace
  contents:
  - "3.5.2.  Documents that Extend an Existing Namespace\n   It is possible to extend\
    \ an existing namespace using a YANG submodule\n   that belongs to an existing\
    \ module already administered by IANA.  In\n   this case, the document containing\
    \ the main module MUST be updated to\n   use the latest revision of the submodule.\n"
- title: 3.6.  Reference Sections
  contents:
  - "3.6.  Reference Sections\n   For every import or include statement that appears\
    \ in a module\n   contained in the specification, which identifies a module in\
    \ a\n   separate document, a corresponding normative reference to that\n   document\
    \ MUST appear in the Normative References section.  The\n   reference MUST correspond\
    \ to the specific module version actually\n   used within the specification.\n\
    \   For every normative reference statement that appears in a module\n   contained\
    \ in the specification, which identifies a separate document,\n   a corresponding\
    \ normative reference to that document SHOULD appear in\n   the Normative References\
    \ section.  The reference SHOULD correspond to\n   the specific document version\
    \ actually used within the specification.\n   If the reference statement identifies\

    \ section.\n"
- title: 4.  YANG Usage Guidelines
  contents:
  - "4.  YANG Usage Guidelines\n   In general, modules in IETF Standards Track specifications\
    \ MUST\n   comply with all syntactic and semantic requirements of YANG\n   [RFC6020].\
    \  The guidelines in this section are intended to supplement\n   the YANG specification,\
    \ which is intended to define a minimum set of\n   conformance requirements.\n\
    \   In order to promote interoperability and establish a set of practices\n  \
    \ based on previous experience, the following sections establish usage\n   guidelines\
    \ for specific YANG constructs.\n   Only guidelines that clarify or restrict the\
    \ minimum conformance\n   requirements are included here.\n"
- title: 4.1.  Module Naming Conventions
  contents:
  - "4.1.  Module Naming Conventions\n   Modules contained in Standards Track documents\
    \ SHOULD be named\n   according to the guidelines in the IANA Considerations section\
    \ of\n   [RFC6020].\n   A distinctive word or acronym (e.g., protocol name or\
    \ working group\n   acronym) SHOULD be used in the module name.  If new definitions\
    \ are\n   being defined to extend one or more existing modules, then the same\n\
    \   word or acronym should be reused, instead of creating a new one.\n   All published\
    \ module names MUST be unique.  For a YANG module\n   published in an RFC, this\
    \ uniqueness is guaranteed by IANA.  For\n   unpublished modules, the authors\
    \ need to check that no other work in\n   progress is using the same module name.\n\
    \   Once a module name is published, it MUST NOT be reused, even if the\n   RFC\
    \ containing the module is reclassified to 'Historic' status.\n"
- title: 4.2.  Identifiers
  contents:

  - "4.5.  XPath Usage\n   This section describes guidelines for using the XML Path\
    \ Language\n   [W3C.REC-xpath-19991116] (XPath) within YANG modules.\n   The 'attribute'\
    \ and 'namespace' axes are not supported in YANG, and\n   MAY be empty in a NETCONF\
    \ server implementation.\n   The 'position' and 'last' functions SHOULD NOT be\
    \ used.  This applies\n   to implicit use of the 'position' function as well (e.g.,\n\
    \   '//chapter[42]').  A server is only required to maintain the relative\n  \
    \ XML document order of all instances of a particular user-ordered list\n   or\
    \ leaf-list.  The 'position' and 'last' functions MAY be used if\n   they are\
    \ evaluated in a context where the context node is a user-\n   ordered 'list'\
    \ or 'leaf-list'.\n   The 'preceding', and 'following' axes SHOULD NOT be used.\
    \  These\n   constructs rely on XML document order within a NETCONF server\n \
    \  configuration database, which may not be supported consistently or\n   produce\
    \ reliable results across implementations.  Predicate\n   expressions based on\
    \ static node properties (e.g., element name or\n   value, 'ancestor' or 'descendant'\
    \ axes) SHOULD be used instead.  The\n   'preceding' and 'following' axes MAY\
    \ be used if document order is not\n   relevant to the outcome of the expression\
    \ (e.g., check for global\n   uniqueness of a parameter value).\n   The 'preceding-sibling'\
    \ and 'following-sibling' axes SHOULD NOT used.\n   A server is only required\
    \ to maintain the relative XML document order\n   of all instances of a particular\
    \ user-ordered list or leaf-list.  The\n   'preceding-sibling' and 'following-sibling'\
    \ axes MAY be used if they\n   are evaluated in a context where the context node\
    \ is a user-ordered\n   'list' or 'leaf-list'.\n   Data nodes that use the 'int64'\
    \ and 'uint64' built-in type SHOULD NOT\n   be used within numeric expressions.\
    \  There are boundary conditions in\n   which the translation from the YANG 64-bit\
    \ type to an XPath number\n   can cause incorrect results.  Specifically, an XPath\
    \ 'double'\n   precision floating point number cannot represent very large positive\n\
    \   or negative 64-bit numbers because it only provides a total precision\n  \
    \ of 53 bits.  The 'int64' and 'uint64' data types MAY be used in\n   numeric\
    \ expressions if the value can be represented with no more than\n   53 bits of\
    \ precision.\n   Data modelers need to be careful not to confuse the YANG value\
    \ space\n   and the XPath value space.  The data types are not the same in both,\n\
    \   and conversion between YANG and XPath data types SHOULD be considered\n  \
    \ carefully.\n   Explicit XPath data type conversions MAY be used (e.g., 'string',\n\
    \   'boolean', or 'number' functions), instead of implicit XPath data\n   type\
    \ conversions.\n"

- title: 4.7.  Module Header, Meta, and Revision Statements
  contents:
  - "4.7.  Module Header, Meta, and Revision Statements\n   For published modules,\
    \ the namespace MUST be a globally unique URI,\n   as defined in [RFC3986].  This\
    \ value is usually assigned by the IANA.\n   The organization statement MUST be\
    \ present.  If the module is\n   contained in a document intended for Standards\
    \ Track status, then the\n   organization SHOULD be the IETF working group chartered\
    \ to write the\n   document.\n   The contact statement MUST be present.  If the\
    \ module is contained in\n   a document intended for Standards Track status, then\
    \ the working\n   group web and mailing information MUST be present, and the main\n\
    \   document author or editor contact information SHOULD be present.  If\n   additional\
    \ authors or editors exist, their contact information MAY be\n   present.  In\
    \ addition, the Area Director and other contact\n   information MAY be present.\n\
    \   The description statement MUST be present.  The appropriate IETF\n   Trust\
    \ Copyright text MUST be present, as described in Section 3.1.\n   If the module\
    \ relies on information contained in other documents,\n   which are not the same\
    \ documents implied by the import statements\n   present in the module, then these\
    \ documents MUST be identified in the\n   reference statement.\n   A revision\
    \ statement MUST be present for each published version of\n   the module.  The\
    \ revision statement MUST have a reference\n   substatement.  It MUST identify\
    \ the published document that contains\n   the module.  Modules are often extracted\
    \ from their original\n   documents, and it is useful for developers and operators\
    \ to know how\n   to find the original source document in a consistent manner.\
    \  The\n   revision statement MAY have a description substatement.\n   Each new\
    \ revision MUST include a revision date that is higher than\n   any other revision\
    \ date in the module.  The revision date does not\n   need to be updated if the\
    \ module contents do not change in the new\n   document revision.\n   It is acceptable\
    \ to reuse the same revision statement within\n   unpublished versions (i.e.,\
    \ Internet-Drafts), but the revision date\n   MUST be updated to a higher value\
    \ each time the Internet-Draft is re-\n   posted.\n"
- title: 4.8.  Namespace Assignments
  contents:
  - "4.8.  Namespace Assignments\n   It is RECOMMENDED that only valid YANG modules\
    \ be included in\n   documents, whether or not they are published yet.  This allows:\n\
    \   o  the module to compile correctly instead of generating disruptive\n    \
    \  fatal errors.\n   o  early implementors to use the modules without picking\
    \ a random\n      value for the XML namespace.\n   o  early interoperability testing\

  contents:
  - "4.9.  Top-Level Data Definitions\n   There SHOULD only be one top-level data\
    \ node defined in each YANG\n   module, if any data nodes are defined at all.\n\
    \   The top-level data organization SHOULD be considered carefully, in\n   advance.\
    \  Data model designers need to consider how the functionality\n   for a given\
    \ protocol or protocol family will grow over time.\n   The names and data organization\
    \ SHOULD reflect persistent\n   information, such as the name of a protocol. \
    \ The name of the working\n   group SHOULD NOT be used because this may change\
    \ over time.\n   A mandatory database data definition is defined as a node that\
    \ a\n   client must provide for the database to be valid.  The server is not\n\
    \   required to provide a value.\n   Top-level database data definitions MUST\
    \ NOT be mandatory.  If a\n   mandatory node appears at the top level, it will\
    \ immediately cause\n   the database to be invalid.  This can occur when the server\
    \ boots or\n   when a module is loaded dynamically at runtime.\n"

  contents:
  - "4.10.  Data Types\n   Selection of an appropriate data type (i.e., built-in type,\
    \ existing\n   derived type, or new derived type) is very subjective, and therefore\n\
    \   few requirements can be specified on that subject.\n   Data model designers\
    \ SHOULD use the most appropriate built-in data\n   type for the particular application.\n\
    \   If extensibility of enumerated values is required, then the\n   'identityref'\
    \ data type SHOULD be used instead of an enumeration or\n   other built-in type.\n\
    \   For string data types, if a machine-readable pattern can be defined\n   for\
    \ the desired semantics, then one or more pattern statements SHOULD\n   be present.\n\
    \   For string data types, if the length of the string is required to be\n   bounded\
    \ in all implementations, then a length statement MUST be\n   present.\n   For\
    \ numeric data types, if the values allowed by the intended\n   semantics are\
    \ different than those allowed by the unbounded intrinsic\n   data type (e.g.,\
    \ 'int32'), then a range statement SHOULD be present.\n   The signed numeric data\
    \ types (i.e., 'int8', 'int16', 'int32', and\n   'int64') SHOULD NOT be used unless\
    \ negative values are allowed for\n   the desired semantics.\n   For 'enumeration'\
    \ or 'bits' data types, the semantics for each 'enum'\n   or 'bit' SHOULD be documented.\
    \  A separate description statement\n   (within each 'enum' or 'bit' statement)\
    \ SHOULD be present.\n"

    \ be associated with the desired\n   semantics, then a units statement SHOULD\
    \ be present.\n   If an appropriate default value can be associated with the desired\n\
    \   semantics, then a default statement SHOULD be present.\n   If a significant\
    \ number of derived types are defined, and it is\n   anticipated that these data\

    \ for technical correctness and for adherence to IETF documentation\n   requirements.\
    \  The following checklist may be helpful when reviewing\n   an Internet-Draft:\n\
    \   1.  I-D Boilerplate -- verify that the draft contains the required\n     \
    \  Internet-Draft boilerplate (see\n       http://www.ietf.org/id-info/guidelines.html),\
    \ including the\n       appropriate statement to permit publication as an RFC,\
    \ and that\n       I-D boilerplate does not contain references or section numbers.\n\
    \   2.  Abstract -- verify that the abstract does not contain references,\n  \
    \     that it does not have a section number, and that its content\n       follows\
    \ the guidelines in\n       http://www.ietf.org/id-info/guidelines.html.\n   3.\
    \  Copyright Notice -- verify that the draft has the appropriate\n       text\
    \ regarding the rights that document contributers provide to\n       the IETF\
    \ Trust [RFC5378].  Verify that it contains the full IETF\n       Trust copyright\
    \ notice at the beginning of the document.  The\n       IETF Trust Legal Provisions\
    \ (TLP) can be found at:\n       http://trustee.ietf.org/license-info/\n   4.\
    \  Security Considerations section -- verify that the draft uses the\n       latest\
    \ approved template from the OPS area website (http://\n       www.ops.ietf.org/netconf/yang-security-considerations.txt)\
    \ and\n       that the guidelines therein have been followed.\n   5.  IANA Considerations\
    \ section -- this section must always be\n       present.  For each module within\
    \ the document, ensure that the\n       IANA Considerations section contains entries\
    \ for the following\n       IANA registries:\n       XML Namespace Registry: \
    \ Register the YANG module namespace.\n       YANG Module Registry:  Register\
    \ the YANG module name, prefix,\n          namespace, and RFC number, according\
    \ to the rules specified in\n          [RFC6020].\n   6.  References -- verify\
    \ that the references are properly divided\n       between normative and informative\
    \ references, that RFC 2119 is\n       included as a normative reference if the\
    \ terminology defined\n       therein is used in the document, that all references\
    \ required by\n       the boilerplate are present, that all YANG modules containing\n\
    \       imported items are cited as normative references, and that all\n     \
    \  citations point to the most current RFCs unless there is a valid\n       reason\
    \ to do otherwise (for example, it is OK to include an\n       informative reference\
    \ to a previous version of a specification to\n       help explain a feature included\
    \ for backward compatibility).  Be\n       sure citations for all imported modules\
    \ are present somewhere in\n       the document text (outside the YANG module).\n\
    \   7.  License -- verify that the draft contains the Simplified BSD\n       License\
    \ in each YANG module or submodule.  Some guidelines\n       related to this requirement\
    \ are described in Section 3.1.  Make\n       sure that the correct year is used\
    \ in all copyright dates.  Use\n       the approved text from the latest Trust\
    \ Legal Provisions (TLP)\n       document, which can be found at:\n       http://trustee.ietf.org/license-info/\n\
    \   8.  Other Issues -- check for any issues mentioned in\n       http://www.ietf.org/id-info/checklist.html\
    \ that are not covered\n       elsewhere.\n   9.  Technical Content -- review\
    \ the actual technical content for\n       compliance with the guidelines in this\
    \ document.  The use of a\n       YANG module compiler is recommended when checking\
    \ for syntax\n       errors.  A list of freely available tools and other information\n\
    \       can be found at:\n       http://trac.tools.ietf.org/wg/netconf/trac/wiki\n\
    \       Checking for correct syntax, however, is only part of the job.\n     \
    \  It is just as important to actually read the YANG module document\n       from\
    \ the point of view of a potential implementor.  It is\n       particularly important\
    \ to check that description statements are\n       sufficiently clear and unambiguous\
    \ to allow interoperable\n       implementations to be created.\n"
