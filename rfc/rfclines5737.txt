Abstract Three IPv4 unicast address blocks are reserved for use in examples in specifications and other documents.
This document describes the use of these blocks.
This document describes three IPv4 address blocks that are provided for use in documentation.
The use of designated address ranges for documentation and examples reduces the likelihood of conflicts and confusion arising from the use of addresses assigned for some other purpose.
[RFC1166] reserves the first of the three address blocks, 192.0.2.0/24.
The other two address blocks have recently been allocated for this purpose, primarily to ease the writing of examples involving addresses from multiple networks.
Other documentation ranges have been defined in the IETF, including the IPv6 documentation prefix [RFC3849] and example domain names [RFC2606].
Documentation also makes use of the ranges reserved in [RFC1918].
The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, [RFC2119].
The blocks 192.0.2.0/24 (TEST NET 1), 198.51.100.0/24 (TEST NET 2), and 203.0.113.0/24
(TEST NET 3) are provided for use in documentation.
Operational Implications Addresses within the TEST NET 1, TEST NET 2, and TEST NET 3 blocks
SHOULD NOT appear on the public Internet and are used without any coordination with IANA or an Internet registry [RFC2050].
Network operators SHOULD add these address blocks to the list of non  routeable address spaces, and if packet filters are deployed, then this address block SHOULD be added to packet filters.
These blocks are not for local use, and the filters may be used in both local and public contexts.
The Status of 128.66.0.0/16 Note that 128.66.0.0/16 has been used for some examples in the past.
However, this block did not appear in the list of special prefixes in [RFC3330] or its successors, and the block is therefore not reserved for any special purpose.
The block can be used for regular address assignments with caution.
This document has no security implications.
IANA Considerations IANA has recorded the allocation of the three address blocks in the IPv4 address registry.
No end party is to be assigned these addresses.
