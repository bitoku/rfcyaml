  - "Abstract\n   When setting up a Label Switched Path (LSP) in Generalized MPLS\n
    \  (GMPLS) and MPLS Traffic Engineering (MPLS-TE) networks, the\n   completion
    of the signaling process does not necessarily mean that\n   the cross-connection
    along the LSP has been programmed accordingly\n   and in a timely manner.  Meanwhile,
    the completion of the signaling\n   process may be used by LSP users or applications
    that control their\n   use as an indication that the data path has become usable.
    \ The\n   existence of the inconsistency between the signaling messages and\n
    \  cross-connection programming, and the possible failure of cross-\n   connection
    programming, if not properly treated, will result in data\n   loss or even application
    failure.  Characterization of this\n   performance can thus help designers to
    improve the way in which LSPs\n   are used and to make applications or tools that
    depend on and use\n   LSPs more robust.  This document defines a series of performance\n
    \  metrics to evaluate the connectivity of the data path in the\n   signaling
    process.\n"

  - "1.  Introduction\n   Label Switched Paths (LSPs) are established, controlled,
    and\n   allocated for use by management tools or directly by the components\n
    \  that use them.  In this document, we call such management tools and\n   the
    components that use LSPs \"applications\".  Such applications may\n   be Network
    Management Systems (NMSs); hardware or software components\n   that forward data
    onto virtual links; programs or tools that use\n   dedicated links; or any other
    user of an LSP.\n   Ideally, the completion of the signaling process means that
    the\n   signaled LSP is ready to carry traffic.  However, in actual\n   implementations,
    vendors may choose to program the cross-connection\n   in a pipelined manner,
    so that the overall LSP provisioning delay can\n   be reduced.  In such situations,
    the data path may not be ready for\n   use instantly after the signaling process
    completes.  Implementation\n   deficiency may also cause inconsistency between
    the signaling process\n   and data path provisioning.  For example, if the data
    plane fails to\n   program the cross-connection accordingly but does not manage
    to\n   report this to the control plane, the signaling process may complete\n
    \  successfully while the corresponding data path will never become\n   functional
    at all.\n   On the other hand, the completion of the signaling process may be\n
    \  used in many cases as an indication of data path connectivity.  For\n   example,
    when invoking through the User-Network Interface (UNI)\n   [RFC4208], a client
    device or an application may use the reception of\n   the correct Resv message
    as an indication that the data path is fully\n   functional and start to transmit
    traffic.  This will result in data\n   loss or even application failure.\n   Although
    RSVP(-TE) specifications have suggested that the cross-\n   connections are programmed
    before signaling messages are propagated\n   upstream, it is still worthwhile
    to verify the conformance of an\n   implementation and measure the delay, when
    necessary.\n   This document defines a series of performance metrics to evaluate
    the\n   connectivity of the data path during the signaling process.  The\n   metrics
    defined in this document complement the control plane metrics\n   defined in [RFC5814].
    \ These metrics can be used to verify the\n   conformance of implementations against
    related specifications, as\n   elaborated in [RFC6383].  They also can be used
    to build more robust\n   applications.\n"

  - "3.  Overview of Performance Metrics\n   In this memo, we define five performance
    metrics to characterize the\n   performance of data path provisioning with GMPLS/MPLS-TE
    signaling.\n   These metrics complement the metrics defined in [RFC5814], in the\n
    \  sense that the completion of the signaling process for an LSP and the\n   programming
    of cross-connections along the LSP may not be consistent.\n   The performance
    metrics in [RFC5814] characterize the performance of\n   LSP provisioning from
    the pure signaling point of view, while the\n   metric in this document takes
    into account the validity of the data\n   path.\n   The five metrics are:\n   o
    \ Resv Received, Forward Data (RRFD) - the delay between the point\n      when
    the Resv message is received by the ingress node and the\n      forward data path
    becomes ready for use.\n   o  Resv Sent, Reverse Data (RSRD) - the delay between
    the point when\n      the Resv message is sent by the egress node and the reverse
    data\n      path becomes ready for use.\n   o  PATH Received, Forward Data (PRFD)
    - the delay between the point\n      when the PATH message is received by the
    egress node and the\n      forward data path becomes ready for use.\n   o  PATH
    Sent, Forward Data (PSFD) - the delay between the point when\n      the PATH message
    is sent by the ingress node and the forward data\n      path becomes ready for
    use.\n   o  PATH Sent, Reverse Data (PSRD) - the delay between the point when\n
    \     the PATH message is sent by the ingress node and the reverse data\n      path
    becomes ready for use.\n   As in [RFC5814], we continue to use the structures
    and notions\n   introduced and discussed in the IP Performance Metrics (IPPM)\n
    \  Framework documents [RFC2330] [RFC2679] [RFC2681].  The reader is\n   assumed
    to be familiar with the notions in those documents.  The\n   reader is also assumed
    to be familiar with the definitions in\n   [RFC5814].\n"
  title: 3.  Overview of Performance Metrics

  - "4.  Terms Used in This Document\n   o  Forward data path - the data path from
    the ingress node to the\n      egress node.  Instances of a forward data path
    include the data\n      path of a unidirectional LSP and a data path from the
    ingress node\n      to the egress node in a bidirectional LSP.\n   o  Reverse
    data path - the data path from the egress node to the\n      ingress node in a
    bidirectional LSP.\n   o  Data path delay - the time needed to complete the data
    path\n      configuration, in relation to the signaling process.  Five types\n
    \     of data path delay are defined in this document, namely RRFD,\n      RSRD,
    PRFD, PSFD, and PSRD.  Data path delay as used in this\n      document must be
    distinguished from the transmission delay along\n      the data path, i.e., the
    time needed to transmit traffic from one\n      side of the data path to the other.\n
    \  o  Error-free signal - data-plane-specific indication of connectivity\n      of
    the data path.  For example, for interfaces capable of packet\n      switching,
    the reception of the first error-free packet from one\n      side of the LSP to
    the other may be used as the error-free signal.\n      For Synchronous Digital
    Hierarchy/Synchronous Optical Network\n      (SDH/SONET) cross-connects, the disappearance
    of alarm can be used\n      as the error-free signal.  Throughout this document,
    we will use\n      \"error-free signal\" as a general term.  An implementation
    must\n      choose a proper data path signal that is specific to the data path\n
    \     technology being tested.\n   o  Ingress/egress node - in this memo, an ingress/egress
    node means a\n      measurement endpoint with both control plane and data plane\n
    \     features.  Typically, the control plane part on an ingress/egress\n      node
    interacts with the control plane of the network under test.\n      The data plane
    part of an ingress/egress node will generate data\n      path signals and send
    the signal to the data plane of the network\n      under test, or receive data
    path signals from the network under\n      test.\n"

    - "5.6.  Discussion\n   The following issues are likely to come up in practice:\n
      \  o  The accuracy of RRFD depends on the clock resolution of both the\n      ingress
      node and egress node.  Clock synchronization between the\n      ingress node
      and egress node is required.\n   o  The accuracy of RRFD is also dependent on
      how the error-free\n      signal is received and may differ significantly when
      the\n      underlying data plane technology is different.  For instance, for\n
      \     an LSP between a pair of Ethernet interfaces, the ingress node may\n      use
      a rate-based method to verify the connectivity of the data\n      path and use
      the reception of the first error-free frame as the\n      error-free signal.
      \ In this case, the interval between two\n      successive frames has a significant
      impact on accuracy.  It is\n      RECOMMENDED that the ingress node use small
      intervals, under the\n      condition that the injected traffic does not exceed
      the capacity\n      of the forward data path.  The value of such intervals MUST
      be\n      reported.\n   o  The accuracy of RRFD is also dependent on the time
      needed to\n      propagate the error-free signal from the ingress node to the\n
      \     egress node.  A typical value for propagating the error-free\n      signal
      from the ingress node to the egress node under the same\n      measurement setup
      MAY be reported.  The methodology to obtain such\n      values is outside the
      scope of this document.\n   o  The accuracy of this metric is also dependent
      on the physical-\n      layer serialization/deserialization of the test signal
      for certain\n      data path technologies.  For instance, for an LSP between
      a pair\n      of low-speed Ethernet interfaces, the time needed to serialize/\n
      \     deserialize a large frame may not be negligible.  In this case, it\n      is
      RECOMMENDED that the ingress node use small frames.  The\n      average length
      of the frame MAY be reported.\n   o  It is possible that under some implementations,
      a node may program\n      the cross-connection before it sends a PATH message
      further\n      downstream, and the data path may be ready for use before a Resv\n
      \     message reaches the ingress node.  In such cases, RRFD can be a\n      negative
      value.  It is RECOMMENDED that a PRFD measurement be\n      carried out to further
      characterize the forward data path delay\n      when a negative RRFD value is
      observed.\n   o  If an error-free signal is received by the egress node before
      a\n      PATH message is sent on the ingress node, an error MUST be\n      reported
      and the measurement SHOULD terminate.\n   o  If the corresponding Resv message
      is received but no error-free\n      signal is received by the egress node within
      a reasonable period\n      of time, i.e., a threshold, RRFD MUST be treated
      as undefined.\n      The value of the threshold MUST be reported.\n   o  If
      the LSP setup fails, this metric value MUST NOT be counted.\n"
    title: 5.6.  Discussion
  - contents:
    - "5.7.  Methodologies\n   Generally, the methodology would proceed as follows:\n
      \  o  Make sure that the network has enough resources to set up the\n      requested
      LSP.\n   o  Start the data path measurement and/or monitoring procedures on\n
      \     the ingress node and egress node.  If an error-free signal is\n      received
      by the egress node before a PATH message is sent, report\n      an error and
      terminate the measurement.\n   o  At the ingress node, form the PATH message
      according to the LSP\n      requirements and send the message towards the egress
      node.\n   o  Upon receiving the last bit of the corresponding Resv message,\n
      \     take the timestamp (T1) on the ingress node as soon as possible.\n   o
      \ When an error-free signal is observed on the egress node, take the\n      timestamp
      (T2) as soon as possible.  An estimate of RRFD (T2 - T1)\n      can be computed.\n
      \  o  If the corresponding Resv message arrives but no error-free signal\n      is
      received within a reasonable period of time by the ingress\n      node, RRFD
      is deemed to be undefined.\n   o  If the LSP setup fails, RRFD is not counted.\n"

    of the performance metric, we now offer several\n   statistics of these samples
    to report.  From these statistics, we can\n   draw some useful conclusions regarding
    a GMPLS network.  The value of\n   these metrics is either a real number of milliseconds
    or undefined.\n   In the following discussion, we only consider the finite values.\n"
  - contents:
    - "11.1.  The Minimum of the Metric\n   The minimum of the metric is the minimum
      of all the dT values in the\n   sample.  In computing this, undefined values
      SHOULD be treated as\n   infinitely large.  Note that this means that the minimum
      could thus\n   be undefined if all the dT values are undefined.  In addition,
      the\n   metric minimum SHOULD be set to undefined if the sample is empty.\n"

    - "11.2.  The Median of the Metric\n   The median of the metric is the median
      of the dT values in the given\n   sample.  In computing the median, the undefined
      values MUST NOT be\n   included.  The median SHOULD be set to undefined if all
      the dT values\n   are undefined, or if the sample is empty.  When the number
      of defined\n   values in the given sample is small, the metric median may not
      be\n   typical and SHOULD be used carefully.\n"

      (EDF) of a set of scalar\n   measurements is a function F(x), which, for any
      x, gives the\n   fractional proportion of the total measurements that were <=
      x.\n   Given a percentage X, the Xth percentile of the metric means the\n   smallest
      value of x for which F(x) >= X.  In computing the\n   percentile, undefined

      Failure\n   Count and Failure Ratio.  The two statistics can be applied to both\n
      \  the forward data path and reverse data path.  For example, when a\n   sample
      of RRFD has been obtained, the forward data path failure\n   statistics can
      be obtained, while a sample of RSRD can be used to\n   calculate the reverse
      data path failure statistics.  Detailed\n   definitions of Failure Count and

        a failure event\n   means that the signaling completes with no error, while
        no error-free\n   signal is observed.  The calculation for Failure Ratio is
        defined as\n   follows:\n   Failure Ratio = Number of undefined value/(Number
        of valid metric\n   values + Number of undefined value) * 100%.\n"

    endpoints must be\n   conformant to signaling specifications and behave as normal
    signaling\n   endpoints, it will not incur security issues other than normal LSP\n
    \  provisioning.  However, the measurement parameters must be carefully\n   selected
    so that the measurements inject trivial amounts of\n   additional traffic into
    the networks they measure.  If they inject\n   \"too much\" traffic, they can
    skew the results of the measurement and\n   in extreme cases cause congestion
    and denial of service.\n   In the data plane, the measurement endpoint MUST use
    a signal that is\n   consistent with what is specified in the control plane.  For
    example,\n   in a packet switched case, the traffic injected into the data plane\n
    \  MUST NOT exceed the specified rate in the corresponding LSP setup\n   request.
    \ In a wavelength switched case, the measurement endpoint\n   MUST use the specified
    or negotiated lambda with appropriate power.\n   The security considerations pertaining
    to the original RSVP protocol\n   [RFC2205] and its TE extensions [RFC3209] also
    remain relevant.\n"
