  - "1. Introduction\n   It is generally acknowledged that one of the most significant\
    \ initial\n   applications of Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) is traffic\n\
    \   engineering (TE) [1][2] in IP networks.  A significant community of\n   IP\
    \ service providers have found that traffic engineering of their\n   networks\
    \ can have tactical and strategic value [2, 3, 4].  To support\n   the traffic\
    \ engineering application, extensions have been specified\n   for Interior Gateway\
    \ Protocols (IGP) IS-IS [5] and OSPF [6], and to\n   signaling protocols RSVP\
    \ [7] and LDP [8].  The extensions for IS-IS,\n   OSPF, and RSVP have all been\
    \ developed and deployed in large scale in\n   many networks consisting of multi-vendor\
    \ equipment.\n   This document discusses the applicability of TE to Internet service\n\
    \   provider networks, focusing on the MPLS-based approach.  It augments\n   the\
    \ existing protocol applicability statements and, in particular,\n   relates to\
    \ the operational applicability of RSVP-TE [9].  Special\n   considerations for\
    \ deployment of MPLS in operational contexts are\n   discussed and the limitations\
    \ of this approach to traffic engineering\n   are highlighted.\n"

  - "2. Technical Overview of ISP Traffic Engineering\n   Traffic engineering (TE)\
    \ is generally concerned with the performance\n   optimization of operational\
    \ networks [2].  In contemporary practice,\n   TE means mapping IP traffic flows\
    \ onto the existing physical network\n   topology in the most effective way to\
    \ accomplish desired operational\n   objectives.  Techniques currently used to\
    \ accomplish this include,\n   but are not limited to:\n          1.  Manipulation\
    \ of IGP cost (metrics)\n          2.  Explicit routing using constrained virtual-circuit\n\
    \              switching techniques such as ATM or Frame Relay SPVCs\n       \
    \   3.  Explicit routing using constrained path setup techniques\n           \
    \   such as MPLS\n   This document is concerned primarily with MPLS techniques.\n\
    \   Specifically, it deals with the ability to use paths other than the\n   shortest\
    \ paths selected by the IGP to achieve a more balanced network\n   utilization,\
    \ e.g., by moving traffic away from IGP-selected shortest\n   paths onto alternate\
    \ paths to avoid congestion in the network.  This\n   can be achieved by using\
    \ explicitly signaled LSP-tunnels.  The\n   explicit routes to be used may be\
    \ computed offline and subsequently\n   downloaded and configured on the routers\
    \ using an appropriate\n   mechanism.  Alternatively, the desired characteristics\
    \ of an LSP\n   (such as endpoints, bandwidth, affinities) may be configured on\
    \ a\n   router, which will then use an appropriate algorithm to compute a\n  \
    \ path through the network satisfying the desired characteristics,\n   subject\
    \ to various types of constraints.  Generally, the\n   characteristics associated\
    \ with LSPs may include:\n          o  Ingress and egress nodes\n          o \
    \ Bandwidth required\n          o  Priority\n          o  Nodes to include or\
    \ exclude in the path\n          o  Affinities to include or exclude in the path\n\
    \          o  Resilience requirements\n   Affinities are arbitrary, provider-assigned,\
    \ attributes applied to\n   links and carried in the TE extensions for the IGPs.\
    \  Affinities\n   impose a class structure on links, which allow different links\
    \ to be\n   logically grouped together.  They can be used to implement various\n\
    \   types of policies, or route preferences that allow the inclusion or\n   exclusion\
    \ of groups of links from the path of LSPs.  Affinities are\n   unique to MPLS\
    \ and the original requirement for them was documented\n   in [2].\n"

  - "3. Applicability of Internet Traffic Engineering\n   As mentioned in [2] and\
    \ [7], traffic engineering with MPLS is\n   appropriate to establish and maintain\
    \ explicitly routed paths in an\n   IP network for effective traffic placement.\
    \  LSP-tunnels can be used\n   to forward subsets of traffic through paths that\
    \ are independent of\n   routes computed by conventional IGP Shortest Path First\
    \ (SPF)\n   algorithms.  This gives network operators significant flexibility\
    \ in\n   controlling the paths of traffic flows across their networks and\n  \
    \ allows policies to be implemented that can result in the performance\n   optimization\
    \ of networks.  Examples of scenarios where MPLS-based TE\n   capabilities are\
    \ applicable in service provider environments are\n   given below.  The applicability\
    \ of MPLS is certainly not restricted\n   to these scenarios.\n"
- title: 3.1 Avoidance of Congested Resources
  contents:
  - "3.1 Avoidance of Congested Resources\n   In order to lower the utilization of\
    \ congested link(s), an operator\n   may utilize TE methods to route a subset\
    \ of traffic away from those\n   links onto less congested topological elements.\
    \  These types of\n   techniques are viable when segments of the network are congested\n\
    \   while other parts are underutilized.\n   Operators who do not make extensive\
    \ use of LSP-tunnels may adopt a\n   tactical approach to MPLS TE in which they\
    \ create LSP-tunnels only\n   when necessary to address specific congestion problems.\
    \  For example,\n   an LSP can be created between two nodes (source and destination)\
    \ that\n   are known to contribute traffic to a congested network element, and\n\
    \   explicitly route the LSP through a separate path to divert some\n   traffic\
    \ away from the congestion.  On the other hand, operators who\n   make extensive\
    \ use of LSP-tunnels, either for measurement or\n   automated traffic control,\
    \ may decide to explicitly route a subset of\n   the LSPs that traverse the point\
    \ of congestion onto alternate paths.\n   This can be employed to respond quickly\
    \ when the bandwidth parameter\n   associated with the LSPs does not accurately\
    \ represent the actual\n   traffic carried by the LSPs, and the operator determines\
    \ that\n   changing the bandwidth parameter values might not be effective in\n\
    \   addressing the issue or may not have lasting impact.\n   There are other approaches\
    \ that measure traffic workloads on LSPs and\n   utilize these empirical statistics\
    \ to configure various\n   characteristics of LSPs.  These approaches, for example,\
    \ can utilize\n   the derived statistics to configure explicit routes for LSPs\
    \ (also\n   known as offline TE [10]).  They can also utilize the statistics to\n\
    \   set the values of various LSP attributes such as bandwidths,\n   priority,\
    \ and affinities (online TE).  All of these approaches can be\n   used both tactically\
    \ and strategically to react to periods of\n   congestion in a network.  Congestion\
    \ may occur as a result of many\n   factors: equipment or facility failure, longer\
    \ than expected\n   provisioning cycles for new circuits, and unexpected surges\
    \ in\n   traffic demand.\n"
- title: 3.2 Resource Utilization in Network Topologies with Parallel Links
  contents:
  - "3.2 Resource Utilization in Network Topologies with Parallel Links\n   In practice,\
    \ many service provider networks contain multiple parallel\n   links between nodes.\
    \  An example is transoceanic connectivity which\n   is often provisioned as numerous\
    \ low-capacity circuits, such as\n   NxDS-3 (N parallel DS-3 circuits) and  NxSTM-1\
    \ (N parallel STM-1\n   circuits).  Parallel circuits also occur quite often in\
    \ bandwidth-\n   constrained cities.  MPLS TE methods can be applied to effectively\n\
    \   distribute the aggregate traffic workload across these parallel\n   circuits.\n\
    \   MPLS-based approaches commonly used in practice to deal with parallel\n  \
    \ links include using LSP bandwidth parameters to control the\n   proportion of\
    \ demand traversing each link, explicitly configuring\n   routes for LSP-tunnels\
    \ to distribute them across the parallel links,\n   and using affinities to map\
    \ different LSPs onto different links.\n   These types of solutions are also applicable\
    \ in networks with\n   parallel and replicated topologies, such as an NxOC-3/12/48\
    \ topology.\n"
- title: 3.3 Implementing Routing Policies using Affinities
  contents:
  - "3.3 Implementing Routing Policies using Affinities\n   It is sometimes desirable\
    \ to restrict certain types of traffic to\n   certain types of links, or to explicitly\
    \ exclude certain types of\n   links in the paths for some types of traffic. \
    \ This might be needed\n   to accomplish some business policy or network engineering\
    \ objectives.\n   MPLS resource affinities provide a powerful mechanism to implement\n\
    \   these types of objectives.\n   As a concrete example, suppose a global service\
    \ provider has a flat\n   (non-hierarchical) IGP.  MPLS TE affinities can be used\
    \ to explicitly\n   keep continental traffic (traffic originating and terminating\
    \ within\n   a continent) from traversing transoceanic resources.\n   Another\
    \ example of using MPLS TE affinities to exclude certain\n   traffic from a subset\
    \ of circuits might be to keep inter-regional\n   LSPs off of circuits that are\
    \ reserved for intra-regional traffic.\n   Still another example is the situation\
    \ in a heterogeneous network\n   consisting of links with different capacities,\
    \ e.g., OC-12, OC-48,\n   and OC-192.  In such networks, affinities can be used\
    \ to force some\n   types of traffic to only traverse links with a given capacity,\
    \ e.g.\n   OC-48.\n"

  - "3.4 Re-optimization After Restoration\n   After the occurrence of a network failure,\
    \ it may be desirable to\n   calculate a new set paths for LSPs to optimizes performance\
    \ over the\n   residual topology.  This re-optimization is complementary to the\n\
    \   fast-reroute operation used to reduce packet losses during routing\n   transients\
    \ under network restoration.  Traffic protection can also be\n   accomplished\
    \ by associating a primary LSP with a set of secondary\n   LSPs, hot-standby LSPs,\
    \ or a combination thereof [11].\n"

  contents:
  - "4.1 Architectural and Operational Considerations\n   When deploying TE solutions\
    \ in a service provider environment, the\n   impact of administrative policies\
    \ and the selection of nodes that\n   will serve as endpoints for LSP-tunnels\
    \ should be carefully\n   considered.  As noted in [9], when devising a virtual\
    \ topology for\n   LSP-tunnels, special consideration should be given to the tradeoff\n\
    \   between the operational complexity associated with a large number of\n   LSP-tunnels\
    \ and the control granularity that large numbers of LSP-\n   tunnels allow.  In\
    \ other words, a large number of LSP-tunnels allow\n   greater control over the\
    \ distribution of traffic across the network,\n   but increases network operational\
    \ complexity.  In large networks, it\n   may be advisable to start with a simple\
    \ LSP-tunnel virtual topology\n   and then introduce additional complexity based\
    \ on observed or\n   anticipated traffic flow patterns [9].\n   Administrative\
    \ policies should guide the amount of bandwidth to be\n   allocated to an LSP.\
    \  One may choose to set the bandwidth of a\n   particular LSP to a statistic\
    \ of the measured observed utilization\n   over an interval of time, e.g., peak\
    \ rate, or a particular percentile\n   or quartile of the observed utilization.\
    \  Sufficient over-\n   subscription (of LSPs) or under-reporting bandwidth on\
    \ the physical\n   links should be used to account for flows that exceed their\
    \ normal\n   limits on an event-driven basis.  Flows should be monitored for\n\
    \   trends that indicate when the bandwidth parameter of an LSP should be\n  \
    \ resized.  Flows should be monitored constantly to detect unusual\n   variance\
    \ from expected levels.  If an unpoliced flow greatly exceeds\n   its assigned\
    \ bandwidth, action should be taken to determine the root\n   cause and remedy\
    \ the problem.  Traffic policing is an option that may\n   be applied to deal\
    \ with congestion problems, especially when some\n   flows exceed their bandwidth\
    \ parameters and interfere with other\n   compliant flows.  However, it is usually\
    \ more prudent to apply\n   policing actions at the edge of the network rather\
    \ than within the\n   core, unless under exceptional circumstances.\n   When creating\
    \ LSPs, a hierarchical network approach may be used to\n   alleviate scalability\
    \ problems associated with flat full mesh virtual\n   topologies.  In general,\
    \ operational experience has shown that very\n   large flows (between city pairs)\
    \ are long-lived and have stable\n   characteristics, while smaller flows (edge\
    \ to edge) are more dynamic\n   and have more fluctuating statistical characteristics.\
    \  A\n   hierarchical architecture can be devised consisting of core and edge\n\
    \   networks in which the core is traffic engineered and serves as an\n   aggregation\
    \ and transit infrastructure for edge traffic.\n   However, over-aggregation of\
    \ flows can result in a stream so large\n   that it precludes the constraint-based\
    \ routing algorithm from finding\n   a feasible path through a network.  Splitting\
    \ a flow by using two or\n   more parallel LSPs and distributing the traffic across\
    \ the LSPs can\n   solve this problem, at the expense of introducing more state\
    \ in the\n   network.\n   Failure scenarios should also be addressed when splitting\
    \ a stream of\n   traffic over several links.  It is of little value to establish\
    \ a\n   finely balanced set of flows over a set of links only to find that\n \
    \  upon link failure the balance reacts poorly, or does not revert to\n   the\
    \ original situation upon restoration.\n"
- title: 4.2 Network Management Aspects
  contents:
  - "4.2 Network Management Aspects\n   Networks planning to deploy MPLS for traffic\
    \ engineering must\n   consider network management aspects, particularly performance\
    \ and\n   fault management [12].  With the deployment of MPLS in any\n   infrastructure,\
    \ some additional operational tasks are required, such\n   as constant monitoring\
    \ to ensure that the performance of the network\n   is not impacted in the end-to-end\
    \ delivery of traffic.  In addition,\n   traffic characteristics, such as latency\
    \ across an LSP, may also need\n   to be assessed on a regular basis to ensure\
    \ that service-level\n   guarantees are achieved.\n   Obtaining information on\
    \ LSP behavior is critical in determining the\n   stability of an MPLS network.\
    \  When LSPs transition or path changes\n   occur, packets may be dropped which\
    \ impacts network performance.  It\n   should be the goal of any network deploying\
    \ MPLS to minimize the\n   volatility of LSPs and reduce the root causes that\
    \ induce this\n   instability.  Unfortunately, there are very few, if any, NMS\
    \ systems\n   that are available at this time with the capability to provide the\n\
    \   correct level of management support, particularly root cause\n   analysis.\
    \  Consequently, most early adopters of MPLS develop their\n   own management\
    \ systems in-house for the MPLS domain.  The lack of\n   availability of commercial\
    \ network management systems that deal\n   specifically with MPLS-related aspects\
    \ is a significant impediment to\n   the large-scale deployment of MPLS networks.\n\
    \   The performance of an MPLS network is also dependent on the\n   configured\
    \ values of bandwidth for each LSP.  Since congestion is a\n   common cause of\
    \ performance degradation in operational networks, it\n   is important to proactively\
    \ avoid these situations.  While MPLS was\n   designed to minimize congestion\
    \ on links by utilizing bandwidth\n   reservations, it is still heavily reliant\
    \ on user configurable data.\n   If the LSP bandwidth value does not properly\
    \ represent the traffic\n   demand of that LSP, over-utilization may occur and\
    \ cause significant\n   congestion within the network.  Therefore, it is important\
    \ to\n   develop, deploy, and maintain a good modeling tool for determining\n\
    \   LSP bandwidth size.  Lack of this capability may result in sub-\n   optimal\
    \ network performance.\n"
- title: 4.3 Capacity Engineering Aspects
  contents:
  - "4.3 Capacity Engineering Aspects\n   Traffic engineering has a goal of ensuring\
    \ traffic performance\n   objectives for different services.  This requires that\
    \ the different\n   network elements be dimensioned properly to handle the expected\
    \ load.\n   More specifically, in mapping given user demands onto network\n  \
    \ resources, network dimensioning involves the sizing of the network\n   elements,\
    \ such as links, processors, and buffers, so that performance\n   objectives can\
    \ be met at minimum cost.  Major inputs to the\n   dimensioning process are cost\
    \ models, characterization of user\n   demands and specification of performance\
    \ objectives.\n   In using MPLS, dimensioning involves the assignment of resources\
    \ such\n   as bandwidth to a set of pre-selected LSPs for carrying traffic, and\n\
    \   mapping the logical network of LSPs onto a physical network of links\n   with\

- title: 5. Limitations

  - "5. Limitations\n   Significant resources can be expended to gain a proper understanding\n\
    \   of how MPLS works.  Furthermore, significant engineering and testing\n   resources\
    \ may need to be invested to identify problems with vendor\n   implementations\
    \ of MPLS.  Initial deployment of MPLS software and the\n   configurations management\
    \ aspects to support TE can consume\n   significant engineering, operations, and\
    \ system development\n   resources.  Developing automated systems to create router\n\
    \   configurations for network elements can require significant software\n   development\
    \ and hardware resources.  Getting to a point where\n   configurations for routers\
    \ are updated in an automated fashion can be\n   a time consuming process.  Tracking\
    \ manual tweaks to router\n   configurations, or problems associated with these\
    \ can be an endless\n   task.  What this means is that much more is required in\
    \ the form of\n   various types of tools to simplify and automate the MPLS TE\
    \ function.\n   Certain architectural choices can lead to operational, protocol,\
    \ and\n   router implementation scalability problems.  This is especially true\n\
    \   as the number of LSP-tunnels or router configuration data in a\n   network\
    \ increases, which can be exacerbated by designs incorporating\n   full meshes,\
    \ which create O(N^2) number of LSPs, where N is the\n   number of network-edge\
    \ nodes.  In these cases, minimizing N through\n   hierarchy, regionalization,\
    \ or proper selection of tunnel termination\n   points can affect the network's\
    \ ability to scale.  Loss of scale in\n   this sense can be via protocol instability,\
    \ inability to change\n   network configurations to accommodate growth, inability\
    \ for router\n   implementations to be updated, hold or properly process\n   configurations,\
    \ or loss of ability to adequately manage the network.\n   Although widely deployed,\
    \ MPLS TE is a new technology when compared\n   to the classic IP routing protocols\
    \ such as IS-IS, OSPF, and BGP.\n   MPLS TE also has more configuration and protocol\
    \ options.  As such,\n   some implementations are not battle-hardened and automated\
    \ testing of\n   various configurations is difficult if not infeasible.  Multi-vendor\n\
    \   environments are beginning to appear, although additional effort is\n   usually\
    \ required to ensure full interoperability.\n   Common approaches to TE in service\
    \ provider environments switch the\n   forwarding paradigm from connectionless\
    \ to connection oriented.\n   Thus, operational analysis of the network may be\
    \ complicated in some\n   regards (and improved in others).  Inconsistencies in\
    \ forwarding\n   state result in dropped packets whereas with connectionless methods\n\
    \   the packet will either loop and drop, or be misdirected onto another\n   branch\
    \ in the routing tree.\n   Currently deployed MPLS TE approaches can be adversely\
    \ affected by\n   both internal and external router and link failures.  This can\
    \ create\n   a mismatch between the signaled capacity and the traffic an LSP-\n\
    \   tunnel carries.\n   Many routers in service provider environments are already\
    \ under\n   stress processing the software workload associated with running IGP,\n\
    \   BGP, and IPC.  Enabling TE in an MPLS environment involves adding\n   traffic\
    \ engineering databases and processes, adding additional\n   information to be\
    \ carried by the routing processes, and adding\n   signaling state and processing\
    \ to these network elements.  Additional\n   traffic measurements may also need\
    \ to be supported.  In some\n   environments, this additional load may not be\
    \ feasible.\n   MPLS in general and MPLS-TE in particular is not a panacea for\
    \ lack\n   of network capacity, or lack of proper capacity planning and\n   provisioning\
    \ in the network dimensioning process.  MPLS-TE may cause\n   network traffic\
    \ to traverse greater distances or to take paths with\n   more network elements,\
    \ thereby incurring greater latency.  Generally,\n   this added inefficiency is\

    \ path to avoid hot spots.  The ability\n   of TE to accommodate more traffic\
    \ on a given topology can also be\n   characterized as a short-term gain during\
    \ periods of persistent\n   traffic growth.  These approaches cannot achieve impossible\
    \ mappings\n   of traffic onto topologies.  Failure to properly capacity plan\

  - "6. Conclusion\n   The applicability of traffic engineering in Internet service\
    \ provider\n   environments has been discussed in this document.  The focus has\
    \ been\n   on the use of MPLS-based approaches to achieve traffic engineering\
    \ in\n   this context.  The applicability of traffic engineering and\n   associated\
    \ management and deployment considerations have been\n   described, and the limitations\
    \ highlighted.\n   MPLS combines the ability to monitor point-to-point traffic\n\
    \   statistics between two routers and the capability to control the\n   forwarding\
    \ paths of subsets of traffic through a given network\n   topology.  This makes\
    \ traffic engineering with MPLS applicable and\n   useful for improving network\
    \ performance by effectively mapping\n   traffic flows onto links within service\
    \ provider networks.  Tools\n   that simplify and automate the MPLS TE functions\
    \ and activation help\n   to realize the full potential.\n"

  contents:
  - "7. Security Considerations\n   This document does not introduce new security\
    \ issues.  When deployed\n   in service provider networks, it is mandatory to\
    \ ensure that only\n   authorized entities are permitted to initiate establishment\
    \ of LSP-\n   tunnels.\n"
