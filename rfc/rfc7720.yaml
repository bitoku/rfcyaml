- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   [RFC2870] discusses protocol and operational requirements\
    \ for root\n   name servers for the Internet's domain name system (DNS) protocol\n\
    \   [RFC1035].  Since its publication, both protocol and operational\n   requirements\
    \ have evolved.  It makes more sense now to separate the\n   two sets of requirements\
    \ into two separate documents.  This document\n   only defines the protocol requirements\
    \ and some deployment\n   requirements.  The operational requirements that were\
    \ defined in RFC\n   2870 have been removed.  Operational requirements are now\
    \ defined by\n   the Root Server System Advisory Committee of ICANN and are documented\n\
    \   in [RSSAC-001].\n   The root servers are authoritative servers of the unique\
    \ [RFC2826]\n   root zone (\".\") [ROOTZONE].  They currently also serve the root-\n\
    \   servers.net zone.  Some also serve the zone for the .arpa top-level\n   domain\
    \ [ARPAZONE] [RFC3172].  This document describes the external\n   interface of\
    \ the root name servers from a protocol viewpoint of the\n   service.  It specifies\
    \ basic requirements for the Internet that DNS\n   clients meet when interacting\
    \ with a root name service over the\n   public Internet.\n   The keywords MUST,\
    \ MUST NOT, REQUIRED, SHALL, SHALL NOT, SHOULD,\n   SHOULD NOT, RECOMMENDED, MAY,\
    \ and OPTIONAL, when they appear in this\n   document, are to be interpreted as\
    \ described in BCP 14, [RFC2119].\n"
- title: 1.1.  Relationship to RFC 2870
  contents:
  - "1.1.  Relationship to RFC 2870\n   This document obsoletes [RFC2870].\n   This\
    \ document and [RSSAC-001] together functionally replace\n   [RFC2870].\n"
- title: 2.  Protocol Requirements
  contents:
  - "2.  Protocol Requirements\n   This section describes the minimum high-level protocol\
    \ requirements.\n   Operative details are documented in [RSSAC-001].\n   The root\
    \ name service:\n   o  MUST implement core DNS [RFC1035] and clarifications to\
    \ the DNS\n      [RFC2181].\n   o  MUST support IPv4 [RFC791] and IPv6 [RFC2460]\
    \ transport of DNS\n      queries and responses.\n   o  MUST support UDP [RFC768]\
    \ and TCP [RFC793] transport of DNS\n      queries and responses.\n   o  MUST\
    \ generate checksums when sending UDP datagrams and MUST verify\n      checksums\
    \ when receiving UDP datagrams containing a non-zero\n      checksum.\n   o  MUST\
    \ implement DNSSEC [RFC4035] as an authoritative name service.\n   o  MUST implement\
    \ extension mechanisms for DNS (EDNS(0)) [RFC6891].\n"
- title: 3.  Deployment Requirements
  contents:
  - "3.  Deployment Requirements\n   The root name service:\n   o  MUST answer queries\
    \ from any entity conforming to [RFC1122] with a\n      valid IP address.\n  \
    \ o  MUST serve the unique [RFC2826] root zone [ROOTZONE].\n"
- title: 4.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "4.  Security Considerations\n   This document does not specify a new protocol.\
    \  However, the root\n   name service is a key component of the Internet architecture\
    \ and play\n   a key role into the overall security of the Internet [RFC2826].\n\
    \   Specific security considerations on the DNS protocols are discussed\n   in\
    \ their respective specifications.  The security considerations on\n   the operational\
    \ side of the root name servers are discussed in\n   [RSSAC-001].\n"
