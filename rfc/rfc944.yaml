  - "INTRODUCTION\n   This RFC identifies the documents specifying the official protocols\n\
    \   used in the Internet.  Comments indicate any revisions or changes\n   planned.\n\
    \   To first order, the official protocols are those in the \"Internet\n   Protocol\
    \ Transition Workbook\" (IPTW) dated March 1982.  There are\n   several protocols\
    \ in use that are not in the IPTW.  A few of the\n   protocols in the IPTW have\
    \ been revised.  Notably, the mail protocols\n   have been revised and issued\
    \ as a volume titled \"Internet Mail\n   Protocols\" dated November 1982.  Telnet\
    \ and the most useful Telnet\n   options have been revised and issued as a volume\
    \ titled \"Internet\n   Telnet Protocol and Options\" (ITP) dated June 1983. \
    \ Some protocols\n   have not been revised for many years, these are found in\
    \ the old\n   \"ARPANET Protocol Handbook\" (APH) dated January 1978.  There is\
    \ also\n   a volume of protocol related information called the \"Internet\n  \
    \ Protocol Implementers Guide\" (IPIG) dated August 1982.\n   This document is\
    \ organized as a sketchy outline.  The entries are\n   protocols (e.g., Transmission\
    \ Control Protocol).  In each entry there\n   are notes on status, specification,\
    \ comments, other references,\n   dependencies, and contact.\n      The STATUS\
    \ is one of: required, recommended, elective, or\n      experimental.\n      The\
    \ SPECIFICATION identifies the protocol defining documents.\n      The COMMENTS\
    \ describe any differences from the specification or\n      problems with the\
    \ protocol.\n      The OTHER REFERENCES identify documents that comment on or\
    \ expand\n      on the protocol.\n      The DEPENDENCIES indicate what other protocols\
    \ are called upon by\n      this protocol.\n"

    \   COMMENTS:\n         This is the universal protocol of the Internet.  This\
    \ datagram\n         protocol provides the universal addressing of hosts in the\n\
    \         Internet.\n         A few minor problems have been noted in this document.\n\
    \         The most serious is a bit of confusion in the route options.\n     \
    \    The route options have a pointer that indicates which octet of\n        \
    \ the route is the next to be used.  The confusion is between the\n         phrases\
    \ \"the pointer is relative to this option\" and \"the\n         smallest legal\
    \ value for the pointer is 4\".  If you are\n         confused, forget about the\
    \ relative part, the pointer begins\n         at 4.\n         Another important\
    \ point is the alternate reassembly procedure\n         suggested in RFC 815.\n\
    \         Some changes are in the works for the security option.\n         Note\
    \ that ICMP is defined to be an integral part of IP.  You\n         have not completed\

    \       Event Processing Section:  There are many minor corrections and\n    \
    \     clarifications needed in this section.\n         Push:  There are still\
    \ some phrases in the document that give a\n         \"record mark\" flavor to\
    \ the push.  These should be further\n         clarified.  The push is not a record\
    \ mark.\n         Urgent:  Page 17 is wrong.  The urgent pointer points to the\n\
    \         last octet of urgent data (not to the first octet of non-ungent\n  \
    \       data).\n"

    \       Listening Servers:  Several comments have been received on\n         difficulties\
    \ with contacting listening servers.  There should\n         be some discussion\
    \ of implementation issues for servers, and\n         some notes on alternative\
    \ models of system and process\n         organization for servers.\n         Maximum\
    \ Segment Size:  The maximum segment size option should\n         be generalized\
    \ and clarified.  It can be used to either\n         increase or decrease the\
    \ maximum segment size from the default.\n         The TCP Maximum Segment Size\
    \ is the IP Maximum Datagram Size\n         minus forty.  The default IP Maximum\
    \ Datagram Size if 576.  The\n         default TCP Maximum Segment Size is 536.\
    \  For further\n         discussion, see RFC 879.\n         Idle Connections:\
    \  There have been questions about\n         automatically closing idle connections.\
    \  Idle connections are\n         ok, and should not be closed.  There are several\
    \ cases where\n         idle connections arise, for example, in Telnet when a\
    \ user is\n         thinking for a long time following a message from the server\n\
    \         computer before his next input.  There is no TCP \"probe\"\n       \
    \  mechanism, and none is needed.\n         Queued Receive Data on Closing:  There\
    \ are several points where\n         it is not clear from the description what\
    \ to do about data\n         received by the TCP but not yet passed to the user,\n\
    \         particularly when the connection is being closed.  In general,\n   \
    \      the data is to be kept to give to the user if he does a RECV\n        \
    \ call.\n         Out of Order Segments:  The description says that segments that\n\
    \         arrive out of order, that is, are not exactly the next segment\n   \
    \      to be processed, may be kept on hand.  It should also point out\n     \
    \    that there is a very large performance penalty for not doing\n         so.\n\
    \         User Time Out:  This is the time out started on an open or send\n  \
    \       call.  If this user time out occurs the user should be\n         notified,\
    \ but the connection should not be closed or the TCB\n         deleted.  The user\
    \ should explicitly ABORT the connection if he\n         wants to give up.\n \

    \          specify a non-default user side data port with the PORT\n         \
    \   command.  The User-PI may request the server side to\n            identify\
    \ a non-default server side data port with the PASV\n            command.  Since\
    \ a connection is defined by the pair of\n            addresses, either of these\
    \ actions is enough to get a\n            different data connection, still it\
    \ is permitted to do both\n            commands to use new ports on both ends\
    \ of the data\n            connection.\n            c.  Reuse of the Data Connection:\
    \  When using the stream\n            mode of data transfer the end of the file\
    \ must be indicated\n            by closing the connection.  This causes a problem\
    \ if\n            multiple files are to be transfered in the session, due to\n\
    \            need for TCP to hold the connection record for a time out\n     \
    \       period to guarantee the reliable communication.  Thus the\n          \
    \  connection can not be reopened at once.\n               There are two solutions\
    \ to this problem.  The first is to\n               negotiate a non-default port\
    \ (as in (b) above).  The\n               second is to use another transfer mode.\n\
    \               A comment on transfer modes.  The stream transfer mode is\n  \
    \             inherently unreliable, since one can not determine if the\n    \
    \           connection closed prematurely or not.  The other transfer\n      \
    \         modes (Block, Compressed) do not close the connection to\n         \
    \      indicate the end of file.  They have enough FTP encoding\n            \
    \   that the data connection can be parsed to determine the\n               end\
    \ of the file.  Thus using these modes one can leave\n               the data\
    \ connection open for multiple file transfers.\n               Why this was not\
    \ a problem with the old NCP FTP:\n                  The NCP was designed with\
    \ only the ARPANET in mind.\n                  The ARPANET provides very reliable\
    \ service, and the\n                  NCP counted on it.  If any packet of data\
    \ from an NCP\n                  connection were lost or damaged by the network\
    \ the NCP\n                  could not recover.  It is a tribute to the ARPANET\n\
    \                  designers that the NCP FTP worked so well.\n              \
    \    The TCP is designed to provide reliable connections\n                  over\
    \ many different types of networks and\n                  interconnections of\
    \ networks.  TCP must cope with a\n                  set of networks that can\
    \ not promise to work as well\n                  as the ARPANET.  TCP must make\
    \ its own provisions for\n                  end-to-end recovery from lost or damaged\
    \ packets.\n                  This leads to the need for the connection phase-down\n\
    \                  time-out.  The NCP never had to deal with\n               \
    \   acknowledgements or retransmissions or many other\n"

    \                things the TCP must do to make connection reliable in\n     \
    \             a more complex world.\n         LIST and NLST:\n            There\
    \ is some confusion about the LIST an NLST commands, and\n            what is\
    \ appropriate to return.  Some clarification and\n            motivation for these\
    \ commands should be added to the\n            specification.\n         Multiple\
    \ 1xx Replies:\n            There is some difference of opinion about the use\
    \ of\n            multiple 1xx responses during command processing.  This\n  \
    \          issue comes up particularly in processing the RETR and STOR\n     \
    \       commands.  The two opinions are summarized below.\n            For Exactly\
    \ One 1xx Response:\n               When a RETR or SEND command is started, the\
    \ server is\n               supposed to give an \"intermediate reply\" of 1xx\
    \ when it\n               is opening the data connection.  Currently, some FTP\n\
    \               servers give two 1xx messages.  This causes problems for\n   \
    \            single-thread FTP user implementations.  After reading\n        \
    \       the first intermediate reply, they go off to do the\n               transfer.\
    \  The second 1xx message is not seen until the\n               end of the transfer.\
    \  The RFC gives a state diagram of\n               the form:\n              \
    \    --------->Wait--------->\n                          /      \\\n         \
    \                 ^      |\n                          |      V\n             \
    \             \\      /\n                           <-----\n               This\
    \ implies any number of 1xx's (including 0).  There is\n               a suspicion\
    \ that this is just sloppy diagraming, and that\n               the intent is\
    \ clear from other parts of the RFC.\n               The FTP specification states\
    \ that the reason for\n               intermediate replies is to allow implementations\
    \ that\n               can't do any better to know when to stop listening to the\n\
    \               control channel and switch their attention to the data\n     \
    \          channel.  Given this intent, it seems clear that there\n          \
    \     should be exactly one 1xx reply at the start of the\n               transfer.\n\
    \               The FTP specification is ambiguous in this regard.  The\n"

    \             state diagrams appear to sanction any number of\n              \
    \ responses.  But the charts before them do not.  And from\n               the\
    \ intent, it seems obvious that exactly one is the\n               right thing.\n\
    \               Consider an implementation on a PC.  It is fairly hard to\n  \
    \             do parallel processing there.  It should be possible for\n     \
    \          a PC implementation to stop paying attention to the\n             \
    \  control channel and start reading the file from the data\n               channel\
    \ when he sees the 1xx response.  The only way this\n               can work is\
    \ if there is only one 1xx response.\n               Of course, one could make\
    \ it a requirement that every FTP\n               implementation must be based\
    \ on good enough interrupt\n               technology so that it can field extra\
    \ responses during\n               the transfer.  But what would such a constraint\
    \ buy?\n               Just the ability to have both a 125 and a 150 response.\n\
    \               It doesn't seem worth the price.  You could just as well\n   \
    \            combine the information in those responses into a single\n      \
    \         one.\n            For Multiple 1xx Responses:\n               The multiple\
    \ 1xx messages arose because the new TCP\n               specification omitted\
    \ the 050 spontaneous reply code.  A\n               solution was to change an\
    \ 050 informational message to a\n               1xx message, creating both a\
    \ 125 and a 150.\n               The state diagrams clearly allow this, and the\n\
    \               \"Command-Reply Sequences\" section does not contradict it.\n\
    \               A multiple 1xx implementation is in accord with the\n        \
    \       formal reply specifications.\n               A multiple 1xx implementation\
    \ works with the TOPS-20\n               FTP's and with a number of different\
    \ UNIX\n               implementations, and the LOCUS system.  So, a lot of\n\
    \               implementors must follow state diagrams in preference to\n   \
    \            prose.\n               However, the observation is certainly correct\
    \ that\n               page 34 of the specification suggests that 1xx replies\n\
    \               can be used by single-thread user implementations to\n       \
    \        switch attention to the data connection.  This would\n              \
    \ allow only a single 1xx message, in contradiction to the\n               state\
    \ diagrams.  It seems a bit strong, however, to call\n               the one sentence\
    \ on page 34 \"the intent\" of the\n               specification, since it is\
    \ contradicted by the format\n               specification of replies.\n"

    \ data\n                  transfer.  A cynic might say that is because the\n \
    \                 Computer Scientists who did these implementations only\n   \
    \               do \"Toy\" file transfers, and often use \"Toy\" operating\n \
    \                 systems.\n                  There has been some complaints from\
    \ the Toy systems\n                  crowd recently that FTP is too complicated.\
    \  Well, it\n                  may be too complicated for Toy systems, but in\
    \ fact it\n                  is too simple for many Real file systems.  For\n\
    \                  example, it has no way to encode a \"library\" (i.e., a\n \
    \                 named collection of subfiles).  It is (barely)\n           \
    \       adequate for shipping around files of text, but not\n                \

    \          bite him.  That is the reason some FTPs put out a\n               \
    \   large informative message at the beginning of the\n                  transfer,\
    \ specifying the file baroqueness that is\n                  involved.  As a Computer\
    \ Scientist, you may find that\n                  message annoying, but if you\
    \ had to use MVS very much,\n                  you would find it helpful, informative,\
    \ and maybe even\n                  reassuring.  Some believe that as DARPA technology\n\
    \                  moves into the production environment of DDN, there\n     \
    \             will be user requirements for such informative\n               \
    \   messages for a variety of vendor operating systems.\n               To provide\
    \ important information to the user the\n               specification should either\
    \ allow multiple 1xx messages,\n               or restore the old spontaneous\
    \ reply category.  In fact,\n               the latter is preferable; this information\
    \ should be\n               displayed to the user, but a user FTP might swallow\
    \ 1xx\n               messages without displaying their text.\n            The\
    \ Answer:\n               Following the Robustness Principle (a protocol\n   \
    \            implementation ought to inflict minimal pain and accept\n       \
    \        maximal pain) there should be only one 1xx response.\n              \
    \ That is, those FTP servers that now issue two 1xx\n               responses\
    \ should combine them.\n"
