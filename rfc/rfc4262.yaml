  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   This document defines a certificate extension for inclusion\
    \ of S/MIME\n   Capabilities in X.509 public key certificates, as defined by RFC\
    \ 3280\n   [RFC3280].\n   The S/MIME Capabilities attribute, defined in RFC 3851\
    \ [RFC3851], is\n   defined to indicate cryptographic capabilities of the sender\
    \ of a\n   signed S/MIME message.  This information can be used by the recipient\n\
    \   in subsequent S/MIME secured exchanges to select appropriate\n   cryptographic\
    \ properties.\n   However, S/MIME does involve also the scenario where, for example,\
    \ a\n   sender of an encrypted message has no prior established knowledge of\n\
    \   the recipient's cryptographic capabilities through recent S/MIME\n   exchanges.\n\
    \   In such a case, the sender is forced to rely on out-of-band means or\n   its\
    \ default configuration to select a content encryption algorithm\n   for encrypted\
    \ messages to recipients with unknown capabilities.  Such\n   default configuration\
    \ may, however, be incompatible with the\n   recipient's capabilities and/or security\
    \ policy.\n   The solution defined in this specification leverages the fact that\n\
    \   S/MIME encryption requires possession of the recipient's public key\n   certificate.\
    \  This certificate already contains information about the\n   recipient's public\
    \ key and the cryptographic capabilities of this\n   key.  Through the extension\
    \ mechanism defined in this specification,\n   the certificate may also identify\
    \ the subject's cryptographic S/MIME\n   capabilities.  This may then be used\
    \ as an optional information\n   resource to select appropriate encryption settings\
    \ for the\n   communication.\n   This document is limited to the \"static\" approach\
    \ where asserted\n   cryptographic capabilities remain unchanged until the certificate\n\
    \   expires or is revoked.  Other \"dynamic\" approaches, which allow\n   retrieval\
    \ of certified dynamically updateable capabilities during the\n   lifetime of\
    \ a certificate, are out of scope of this document.\n"

- title: 2.  S/MIME Capabilities Extension
  contents:
  - "2.  S/MIME Capabilities Extension\n   This section defines the S/MIME Capabilities\
    \ extension.\n   The S/MIME Capabilities extension data structure used in this\n\
    \   specification is identical to the data structure of the\n   SMIMECapabilities\
    \ attribute defined in RFC 3851 [RFC3851].  (The\n   ASN.1 structure of smimeCapabilities\
    \ is included below for\n   illustrative purposes only.)\n      smimeCapabilities\
    \ OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::=\n         {iso(1) member-body(2) us(840) rsadsi(113549)\
    \ pkcs(1)\n         pkcs-9(9) 15}\n      SMIMECapabilities ::= SEQUENCE OF SMIMECapability\n\
    \      SMIMECapability ::= SEQUENCE {\n         capabilityID OBJECT IDENTIFIER,\n\
    \         parameters ANY DEFINED BY capabilityID OPTIONAL }\n   All content requirements\
    \ defined for the SMIMECapabilities attribute\n   in RFC 3851 apply also to this\
    \ extension.\n   There are numerous different types of S/MIME Capabilities that\
    \ have\n   been defined in various documents.  While all of the different\n  \
    \ capabilities can be placed in this extension, the intended purpose of\n   this\
    \ specification is mainly to support inclusion of S/MIME\n   Capabilities specifying\
    \ content encryption algorithms.\n   Certification Authorities (CAs) SHOULD limit\
    \ the type of included\n   S/MIME Capabilities in this extension to types that\
    \ are considered\n   relevant to the intended use of the certificate.\n   Client\
    \ applications processing this extension MAY at their own\n   discretion ignore\
    \ any present S/MIME Capabilities and SHOULD always\n   gracefully ignore any\
    \ present S/MIME Capabilities that are not\n   considered relevant to the particular\
    \ use of the certificate.\n   This extension MUST NOT be marked critical.\n"
- title: 3.  Use in Applications
  contents:
  - "3.  Use in Applications\n   Applications using the S/MIME Capabilities extension\
    \ SHOULD NOT use\n   information in the extension if more reliable and relevant\n\
    \   authenticated capabilities information is available to the\n   application.\n\
    \   It is outside the scope of this specification to define what is, or\n   is\
    \ not, regarded as a more reliable source of information by the\n   application\
    \ that is using the certificate.\n"
- title: 4.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "4.  Security Considerations\n   The S/MIME Capabilities extension contains a\
    \ statement about the\n   subject's capabilities made at the time of certificate\
    \ issuance.\n   Implementers should therefore take into account any effect caused\
    \ by\n   the change of these capabilities during the lifetime of the\n   certificate.\n\
    \   Change in the subject's capabilities during the lifetime of a\n   certificate\
    \ may require revocation of the certificate.  Revocation\n   should, however,\
    \ only be motivated if a listed algorithm is\n   considered broken or considered\
    \ too weak for the governing security\n   policy.\n   Implementers should take\
    \ into account that the use of this extension\n   does not change the fact that\
    \ it is always the responsibility of the\n   sender to choose sufficiently strong\
    \ encryption for its information\n   disclosure.\n"
