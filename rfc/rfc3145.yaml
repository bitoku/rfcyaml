  - "Abstract\n   This document provides an extension to the Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol\n\
    \   (\"L2TP\"), a mechanism for tunneling Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP)\n   sessions.\
    \  L2TP lacks a mechanism for a host to provide PPP-related\n   disconnect cause\
    \ information to another host.  This information,\n   provided by the extension\
    \ described in this document, can be useful\n   for accounting and debugging purposes.\n"
- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   L2TP [1] defines a general-purpose mechanism for tunneling\
    \ PPP over\n   various media.  By design, it insulates L2TP operation from the\n\
    \   details of the PPP session that is being encapsulated by L2TP.  There\n  \
    \ are, however, cases where it may be desirable for PPP-specific\n   disconnect\
    \ information to be provided to an L2TP host (L2TP Access\n   Concentrator [LAC]\
    \ or L2TP Network Server [LNS]) in a descriptive\n   format.  The lack of this\
    \ information is especially a problem when\n   the LAC and LNS are not owned or\
    \ managed by the same entities.\n   The Result and Error Codes defined for L2TP\
    \ specify only L2TP-\n   specific disconnect information.  This document provides\
    \ an\n   additional Attribute Value Pair (AVP), called PPP Disconnect Cause\n\
    \   Code, that MAY be used by an L2TP host to provide PPP-specific\n   disconnect\
    \ information to its peer.  This AVP should be used in\n   conjunction with, and\
    \ not as a replacement for, the L2TP Result and\n   Error Code AVPs.\n   The PPP\
    \ Disconnect Cause Code AVP can also be used to provide a\n   human-readable disconnect\
    \ reason to the user.  This AVP should not\n   have any effect on either the functioning\
    \ of the tunnel or the\n   functioning of the PPP session; it is for informational\
    \ and logging\n   purposes only.\n   The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"\
    REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\"\
    , \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n   document are to be interpreted as described\
    \ in BCP 14 [2].\n"

- title: 4.  Notes
  contents:
  - "4.  Notes\n   This AVP MAY may be sent by either the LNS or LAC.  It is generally\n\
    \   expected that this AVP will be most useful in sending notification\n   from\
    \ the LNS to LAC in the compulsory tunneling case, although it is\n   not precluded\
    \ from use in any other case.\n   A draft form of this AVP used Vendor ID 43 (3Com\
    \ Corporation) and\n   vendor-specific Attribute Type 46.  Implementations MAY\
    \ accept AVPs\n   with these values as equivalent to the message described in\
    \ this\n   document, but SHOULD NOT transmit an AVP using these values.\n"
- title: 5.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "5.  Security Considerations\n   The integrity and confidentiality of this AVP\
    \ relies on the\n   underlying L2TP security mechanisms.  It is intended for logging\
    \ and\n   diagnostic purposes in the event of PPP link failure and should not\n\
    \   pose a threat to system security, but the AVP MAY be hidden as\n   described\
    \ in section 4.3 of RFC 2661.\n   The defined extension does not provide information\
    \ that would be\n   useful to an attacker.  Future extensions should not be defined\
    \ to\n   lessen security.  For instance, it is inappropriate to provide\n   distinguishing\
    \ information that would inform the peer that a given\n   authentication name\
    \ is correct, but the password/secret is incorrect.\n"
