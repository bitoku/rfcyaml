  - "1.  Introduction\n   The \"Mobile Node Identifier Option for Mobile IPv6 (MIPv6)\"
    [RFC4283]\n   has proved to be a popular design tool for providing identifiers
    for\n   mobile nodes during authentication procedures with Authentication,\n   Authorization,
    and Accounting (AAA) protocols such as Diameter\n   [RFC6733].  To date, only
    a single type of identifier has been\n   specified, namely the Mobile Node (MN)
    NAI.  Other types of\n   identifiers are in common use and are even referenced
    in RFC 4283.\n   In this document, we propose adding some basic identifier types
    that\n   are defined in various telecommunications standards, including types\n
    \  for International Mobile Subscriber Identity (IMSI) [ThreeGPP-IDS],\n   Packet
    - Temporary Mobile Subscriber Identity (P-TMSI)\n   [ThreeGPP-IDS], International
    Mobile station Equipment Identities\n   (IMEI) [ThreeGPP-IDS], and Globally Unique
    Temporary UE Identity\n   (GUTI) [ThreeGPP-IDS].  In addition, we specify the
    IPv6 address\n   itself and IEEE MAC-layer addresses as Mobile Node identifiers.\n
    \  Defining identifiers that are tied to the physical elements of the\n   device
    (e.g., the MAC address) help in deployment of Mobile IP\n   because, in many cases,
    such identifiers are the most natural means\n   for uniquely identifying the device
    and will avoid additional lookup\n   steps that might be needed if other identifiers
    were used.\n"

      assigned to the mobile node.  The\n   IPv6 address MUST be a unicast routable
      IPv6 address.  Multicast\n   addresses, link-local addresses, and the unspecified
      IPv6 address\n   MUST NOT be used.  IPv6 Unique Local Addresses (ULAs) MAY be

  - "5.  Security Considerations\n   This document does not introduce any security
    mechanisms and does not\n   have any impact on existing security mechanisms.\n
    \  Mobile node identifiers such as those described in this document are\n   considered
    to be private information.  If used in the MN identifier\n   extension as defined
    in [RFC4283], the packet including the MN\n   identifier extension MUST be encrypted
    so that no personal\n   information or trackable identifiers are inadvertently
    disclosed to\n   passive observers.  Operators can potentially apply IPsec\n   Encapsulating
    Security Payload (ESP) [RFC4303] in transport mode with\n   confidentiality and
    integrity protection for protecting the identity\n   and location information
    in MIPv6 signaling messages.\n   Some MN identifiers contain sensitive identifiers
    that, as used in\n   protocols specified by other Standards Development Organizations\n
    \  (SDOs), are only used for signaling during initial network entry.  In\n   such
    protocols, subsequent exchanges then rely on a temporary\n   identifier allocated
    during the initial network entry.  Managing the\n   association between long-lived
    and temporary identifiers is outside\n   the scope of this document.\n"

    \                Table 2: New Mobile Node Identifier Types\n   See Section 4 for
    additional information about the identifier types.\n   The registration procedure
    is Standards Action [RFC8126].  The expert\n   must ascertain that the identifier
    type allows unique identification\n   of the mobile device; since all MN identifiers
    require encryption,\n   there is no additional privacy exposure attendant to the
    use of new\n   types.\n"

    composed\n   for inclusion in the main body of the specification but was moved\n
    \  into an appendix because there was insufficient support for\n   allocating
    Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) types at the time.\n   It was observed that
    RFID-based mobile devices may create privacy\n   exposures unless confidentiality
    is assured for signaling.  A\n   specification for eliminating unauthorized RFID
    tracking based on\n   Layer 2 addresses would be helpful.\n   Much of the following
    text is due to contributions from Hakima\n   Chaouchi.  For an overview and some
    initial suggestions about using\n   RFID with IPv6 on mobile devices, see [Using-RFID-IPv6].\n
    \  In the context of Internet of Things (IoT) and Industry 4.0, vertical\n   domain,
    efficient inventory, and tracking items are of major\n   interest, and RFID technology
    is the identification technology in the\n   hardware design of many such items.\n
    \  The \"TRACK-IoT\" project [TRACK-IoT] [RFID-framework] explored Mobile\n   IPv6
    as a mobility management protocol for RFID-based mobile devices.\n   1.  Passive
    RFID tags (that have no processing resources) need to be\n       handled by the
    gateway (likely also the RFID reader), which is\n       then the endpoint of the
    mobility protocol.  It is also the point\n       where the Change of Address (CoA)
    will be created based on some\n       combination such as the RFID tag and the
    prefix of that gateway.\n       The point here is to offer the possibility to
    passive RFID items\n       to get an IPv6 address and take advantage of the mobility\n
    \      framework to follow the mobile device (passive tag on the item).\n       One
    example scenario that has been proposed, which shows the need\n       for mobility
    management of passive RFID items, would be pieces of\n       art tagged with passive
    tags that need to be monitored while\n       transported.\n   2.  Using active
    RFID tags (where the processing resource is\n       available on the tag), the
    endpoint of the mobility protocol can\n       be hosted directly on the RFID active
    tag, which is also called\n       an identification sensor.  A use case for active
    RFID tags\n       includes traceability of cold food during mobility (transport).\n
    \      Also, mobility of cars equipped with active RFID tags that we\n       already
    use for toll payment can be added with mobility\n       management.\n   One major
    effort to connect IETF efforts to EPCglobal (RFID\n   standardization) led to
    the Object Name Service (ONS), which is the\n   DNS version applied for RFID logical
    names and page information\n   retrieval.  Attempts have been made to connect
    IPv6 on the address\n   space to RFID identifier format.  Other initiatives started
    working\n   on gateways to map tag identifiers with IPv6 addresses and build\n
    \  signaling protocols for the application level.  For instance,\n   tracking
    of mobile items equipped with a tag can be triggered\n   remotely by a remote
    correspondent node until a visiting area where a\n   mobile item equipped with
    an RFID tag is located.  An RFID reader\n   will be added with an IPv6-to-RFID
    tag translation.  One option is to\n   build a home IPv6 address of that tagged
    item by using the prefix of\n   the home agent combined with the tag RFID identifier
    of the mobile\n   item; as the tag ID is unique, the home IPv6 address of that
    item\n   will be also unique.  Then, the visiting RFID reader will compose the\n
    \  IPv6 care of address of the tagged mobile item by combining the\n   prefix
    of the RFID reader with the tag ID of the item.  MIPv6 can\n   then normally provide
    the mobility management of that RFID-tagged\n   item.  A different, useful example
    of tagged items involves items of\n   a factory that can be tracked while they
    are transported, especially\n   for real-time localization and tracking of precious
    items transported\n   without GPS.  An automotive car manufacturer can assign
    IPv6\n   addresses corresponding to RFID-tagged cars or mechanical car parts\n
    \  and build a tracking data set of the mobility not only of the cars,\n   but
    also of the mechanical pieces.\n   The Tag Data Standard promoted by Electronic
    Product Code (EPC)\n   [EPC-Tag-Data] supports several encoding systems or schemes,
    which\n   are commonly used in RFID applications, including the following:\n   o
    \ RFID-GID (Global Identifier),\n   o  RFID-SGTIN (Serialized Global Trade Item
    Number),\n   o  RFID-SSCC (Serial Shipping Container Code),\n   o  RFID-SGLN (Serialized
    Global Location Number),\n   o  RFID-GRAI (Global Returnable Asset Identifier),\n
    \  o  RFID-DOD (Department of Defense ID), and\n   o  RFID-GIAI (Global Individual
    Asset Identifier).\n   For each RFID scheme except GID, there are three representations:\n
    \  o  a 64-bit binary representation (for example, SGLN-64), excluding\n      GID,\n
    \  o  a 96-bit binary representation (SGLN-96), and\n   o  a representation as
    a URI.\n   The URI representation for the RFID is actually a URN.  The EPC\n   document
    has the following language:\n      All categories of URIs are represented as Uniform
    Reference Names\n      (URNs) as defined by [RFC2141], where the URN Namespace
    is epc.\n   The following list includes the above RFID types.\n   +----------------+--------------------------------+-----------------+\n

    - "A.1.  Description of the RFID Types\n   The material in this appendix has been
      either quoted or loosely\n   adapted from [EPC-Tag-Data].\n   The General Identifier
      (GID) that is used with RFID is composed of\n   three fields: General Manager
      Number, Object Class, and Serial\n   Number.  The General Manager Number identifies
      an organizational\n   entity that is responsible for maintaining the numbers
      in subsequent\n   fields.  GID encodings include a fourth field, the header,
      to\n   guarantee uniqueness in the namespace defined by EPC.\n   Some of the
      RFID types depend on the Global Trade Item Number (GTIN)\n   code defined in
      the EAN.UCC General Specifications [EANUCCGS].  A\n   GTIN identifies a particular
      class of object, such as a particular\n   kind of product or SKU.\n   The EPC
      encoding scheme for SGTIN permits the direct embedding of\n   EAN.UCC System
      standard GTIN and Serial Number codes on EPC tags.  In\n   all cases, the check
      digit is not encoded.  Two encoding schemes are\n   specified, SGTIN-64 (64
      bits) and SGTIN-96 (96 bits).\n   The Serial Shipping Container Code (SSCC)
      is defined by the EAN.UCC\n   Specifications.  Unlike the GTIN, the SSCC is
      already intended for\n   assignment to individual objects and therefore does
      not require\n   additional fields to serve as an EPC pure identity.  Two encoding\n
      \  schemes are specified, SSCC-64 (64 bits) and SSCC-96 (96 bits).\n   The Global
      Location Number (GLN) is defined by the EAN.UCC\n   Specifications.  A GLN can
      represent either a discrete, unique\n   physical location such as a warehouse
      slot, or an aggregate physical\n   location such as an entire warehouse.  In
      addition, a GLN can\n   represent a logical entity that performs a business
      function such as\n   placing an order.  The Serialized Global Location Number
      (SGLN)\n   includes the Company Prefix, Location Reference, and Serial Number.\n
      \  The Global Returnable Asset Identifier (GRAI) is defined by the\n   General
      EAN.UCC Specifications.  Unlike the GTIN, the GRAI is already\n   intended for
      assignment to individual objects and therefore does not\n   require any additional
      fields to serve as an EPC pure identity.  The\n   GRAI includes the Company
      Prefix, Asset Type, and Serial Number.\n   The Global Individual Asset Identifier
      (GIAI) is defined by the\n   General EAN.UCC Specifications.  Unlike the GTIN,
      the GIAI is already\n   intended for assignment to individual objects and therefore
      does not\n   require any additional fields to serve as an EPC pure identity.
      \ The\n   GRAI includes the Company Prefix and Individual Asset Reference.\n
      \  The DoD Construct identifier is defined by the United States\n   Department
      of Defense (DoD).  This tag data construct may be used to\n   encode tags for
      shipping goods to the DoD by a supplier who has\n   already been assigned a
      Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) code.\n"
