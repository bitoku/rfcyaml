  - "1.  Introduction\n   PXE, the Preboot eXecution Environment, is a first-stage\
    \ network\n   bootstrap agent.  PXE is loaded out of firmware on the client host,\n\
    \   and performs DHCP [3] queries to obtain an IP address.\n   Once on the network,\
    \ it loads a second-stage bootstrap agent as\n   configured by DHCP header and\
    \ option contents.\n   PXELINUX is one such second-stage bootstrap agent.  Once\
    \ PXE has\n   passed execution to it, PXELINUX seeks its configuration from a\
    \ cache\n   of DHCP options supplied to the PXE first-stage agent, and then takes\n\
    \   action based upon those options.\n   Most frequently, this implies loading\
    \ via Trivial File Transfer\n   Protocol (TFTP) [6] one or more images that are\
    \ decompressed into\n   memory, then executed to pass execution to the final Host\
    \ Operating\n   System.\n   PXELINUX uses DHCP options 208-211 to govern parts\
    \ of this bootstrap\n   process, but these options are not requested by the PXE\
    \ DHCP client\n   at the time it acquires its lease.  At that time, the PXE bootloader\n\
    \   has no knowledge that PXELINUX is going to be in use, and even so,\n   would\
    \ have no way to know what option(s) PXELINUX might digest.\n   Local installations\
    \ that serve this PXELINUX image to its clients\n   must also configure their\
    \ DHCP servers to provide these options even\n   though they are not on the DHCP\
    \ Parameter Request List [4].\n   These options are:\n   o  \"MAGIC\" - 208 -\
    \ An option whose presence and content verifies to\n      the PXELINUX bootloader\
    \ that the options numbered 209-211 are for\n      the purpose as described herein.\n\
    \   o  \"ConfigFile\" - 209 - Configures the path/filename component of the\n\
    \      configuration file's location, which this bootloader should use to\n  \
    \    configure itself.\n   o  \"PathPrefix\" - 210 - Configures a value to be\
    \ prepended to the\n      ConfigFile to discern the directory location of the\
    \ file.\n   o  \"RebootTime\" - 211 - Configures a timeout after which the\n \
    \     bootstrap program will reboot the system (most likely returning it\n   \
    \   to PXE).\n   Historically, these option codes numbering from 208-211 were\n\
    \   designated 'Site Local', but after publication of RFC3942 [8], they\n   were\
    \ made available for allocation as new standard DHCP options.\n   This document\
    \ marks these codes as assigned.\n   This direct assignment of option code values\
    \ in the option\n   definitions below is unusual as it is not mentioned in DHCP\
    \ Option\n   Code assignment guidelines [5].  This document's Option Code\n  \
    \ assignments are done within RFC 3942's provisions for documenting\n   prior\
    \ use of option codes within the new range (128-223 inclusive).\n"

    \ order may\n      have many stages, such as where a BIOS boots a DOS Boot Disk,\n\
    \      which then loads a PXE executable, it is, in this example, only\n     \
    \ the PXE executable that this document describes as the \"first-\n      stage\
    \ bootloader\" -- in essence, this is the first stage of\n      booting at which\
    \ DHCP is involved.\n   o  \"second-stage bootloader\" - This describes a program\
    \ loaded by the\n      first-stage bootloader at the behest of the DHCP server.\n\
    \   o  \"bootloader\" and \"network bootstrap agent\" - These are synonyms,\n\
    \      excepting that \"bootloader\" is intentionally vague in that its\n    \
    \  next form of bootstrapping may not in fact involve network\n      resources.\n\
    \   The key words \"MAY\", \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"SHOULD\", and \"SHOULD NOT\"\
    \n   in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [2].\n"

    \   as described below.  Otherwise, they are ignored.\n   This measure was intended\
    \ to ensure that, as the 'Site Local' option\n   space is not allocated from a\

  - "5.1.  Description\n   In PXELINUX' case, it is often the case that several different\n\
    \   environments would have the same TFTP path prefix, but would have\n   different\
    \ filenames (for example: hosts' bootloader images and config\n   files may be\
    \ kept in a directory structure derived from their Media\n   Access Control (MAC)\
    \ address).  Consequently, it was deemed\n   worthwhile to deliver a TFTP path\
    \ prefix configuration option, so\n   that these two things could be configured\
    \ separately in a DHCP Server\n   configuration: the prefix and the possibly host-specific\
    \ file\n   location.\n   The actual filename that PXELINUX requests from its TFTP\
    \ server is\n   derived by prepending this value to the Config File Option above.\n\
    \   Once this config file is loaded and during processing, any TFTP file\n   paths\

- title: 5.3.  Applicability
  contents:
  - "5.3.  Applicability\n   This option came into existence because server administrators\
    \ found\n   it useful to configure the prefix and suffix of the config file path\n\
    \   separately.  A group of different PXE booting clients may use the\n   same\
    \ path prefix, but different filenames, or vice versa.\n   The 'shortcut' this\
    \ represents is worthwhile, but it is questionable\n   whether that needs to manifest\
    \ itself on the protocol wire.\n   It only becomes interesting from a protocol\
    \ standpoint if other\n   options are adopted that prefix this value as well --\
    \ performing a\n   kind of string compression is highly beneficial to the limited\n\
    \   available DHCP option space.\n   But it's clearly inapplicable to any current\
    \ use of, e.g., the\n   FILENAME header contents or the DHCP Boot File Name option\
    \ (#67).\n   Use of these fields is encoded on firmware of thousands of devices\n\
    \   that can't or are not likely to be upgraded.  Altering any behaviour\n   here\
    \ is likely to cause severe compatibility problems.\n   Although compression of\

    \ a large variety of different\n   clients load the same configuration file, with\

  - "6.1.  Description\n   Should PXELINUX be executed, and then for some reason,\
    \ be unable to\n   reach its TFTP server to continue bootstrapping, the client\
    \ will, by\n   default, reboot itself after 300 seconds have passed.  This may\
    \ be\n   too long, too short, or inappropriate behaviour entirely, depending\n\
    \   on the environment.\n   By configuring a non-zero value in this option, admins\
    \ can inform\n   PXELINUX of which specific timeout is desired.  The client will\n\
    \   reboot itself if it fails to achieve its configured network resources\n  \
    \ within the specified number of seconds.\n   This reboot will run through the\
    \ system's normal boot-time execution\n   path, most likely leading it back to\
    \ PXE and therefore PXELINUX.  So,\n   in the general case, this is akin to returning\
    \ the client to the DHCP\n   INIT state.\n   By configuring zero, the feature\
    \ is disabled, and instead the client\n   chooses to remove itself from the network\
    \ and wait indefinitely for\n   operator intervention.\n   It should be stressed\
    \ that this is in no way related to configuring a\n   lease time.  The perceived\
    \ transition to INIT state is due to client\n   running state -- reinitializing\

    \ the\n   correct, authoritative DHCP server.\n   The use of TFTP by PXE and PXELINUX\
    \ also lacks any form of\n   cryptographic signature -- so a 'Man in the Middle'\
    \ attack may lead\n   to an attacker's code being executed on the client system.\
    \  Since\n   this is not an encrypted channel, any of the TFTP loaded data may\n\
    \   also be exposed (such as in loading a \"RAMDISK\" image, which contains\n\
    \   /etc/passwd or similar information).\n   The use of the Ethernet MAC Address\
    \ as the client's unique identity\n   may allow an attacker who takes on that\
    \ identity to gain\n   inappropriate access to a client system's network resources\
    \ by being\n   given by the DHCP server whatever 'keys' are required, in fact,\
    \ to be\n   the target system (to boot up as though it were the target).\n   Great\
    \ care should be taken to secure PXE and PXELINUX installations,\n   such as by\
    \ using IP firewalls, to reduce or eliminate these concerns.\n   A nearby attacker\
    \ might feed a \"Reboot Time\" option value of 1 second\n   to a mass of unsuspecting\
    \ clients, to effect a Denial Of Service\n   (DoS) upon the DHCP server, but then\
    \ again it may just as easily\n   supply these clients with rogue second-stage\
    \ bootloaders that simply\n   transmit a flood of packets.\n   This document in\
    \ and by itself provides no security, nor does it\n   impact existing DCHP security\
    \ as described in RFC 2131 [3].\n"
