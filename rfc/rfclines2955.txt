Abstract This memo defines a Management Information Base (MIB) to configure, monitor, and control a service interworking function (IWF) for Permanent Virtual Connections (PVC) between Frame Relay and Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) technologies.
The SNMP Management Framework presently consists of five major components:  An overall architecture, described in RFC 2571 [1].
Mechanisms for describing and naming objects and events for the purpose of management.
The first version of this Structure of Management Information (SMI) is called SMIv1 and described in STD 16, RFC 1155 [2], STD 16, RFC 1212 [3] and RFC 1215 [4].
The second version, called SMIv2, is described in STD 58, RFC 2578 [5], STD 58, RFC 2579 [6] and STD 58, RFC 2580 [7].
Message protocols for transferring management information.
The first version of the SNMP message protocol is called SNMPv1 and described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [8].
A second version of the SNMP message protocol, which is not an Internet standards track protocol, is called SNMPv2c and described in RFC 1901 [9] and RFC 1906 [10].
The third version of the message protocol is called SNMPv3 and described in RFC 1906 [10], RFC 2572 [11] and RFC 2574 [12].
Protocol operations for accessing management information.
The first set of protocol operations and associated PDU formats is described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [8].
A second set of protocol operations and associated PDU formats is described in RFC 1905 [13].
A set of fundamental applications described in RFC 2573 [14] and the view based access control mechanism described in RFC 2575 [15].
A more detailed introduction to the current SNMP Management Framework can be found in RFC 2570 [16].
Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed the Management Information Base or MIB.
Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the SMI.
This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2.
A MIB conforming to the SMIv1 can be produced through the appropriate translations.
The resulting translated MIB must be semantically equivalent, except where objects or events are omitted because no translation is possible (use of Counter64).
Some machine readable information in SMIv2 will be converted into textual descriptions in SMIv1 during the translation process.
However, this loss of machine readable information is not considered to change the semantics of the MIB.
The keywords MUST, MUST NOT, REQUIRED, SHALL,
SHALL NOT, SHOULD, SHOULD NOT, RECOMMENDED, NOT RECOMMENDED, MAY, and OPTIONAL
, when they appear in this document, are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [23].
This document defines a Management Information Base (MIB) for monitoring and controlling a service interworking function (IWF) for Permanent Virtual Connections (PVC) between Frame Relay and Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) technologies.
The agreements on which this MIB is based were reached jointly by the Frame Relay Forum and the ATM Forum and are documented in the Frame Relay Forum Document FRF.8 [17].
Frame Relay/ATM Service Interworking Background Frame relay to ATM interworking is a function that exchanges Protocol Data Units (PDU) between a frame relay service user and an ATM service user.
Two types of interworking functions are specified for frame relay and ATM permanent virtual connection
network interworking and service interworking.
Network interworking provides PDU forwarding between frame relay service users
inter connected by an ATM service.
Both endpoints are frame relay PVCs.
Frame Relay to ATM PVC Network Interworking is defined in [20].
Service interworking provides PDU forwarding so that the ATM service user performs no frame relaying service specific functions and the frame relay service user performs no ATM service specific functions.
Optionally, the service IWF translates particular higher layer protocols to satisfy the requirements of end systems.
Frame Relay to ATM PVC Service Interworking is defined in [17].
This MIB describes management objects used to provision, monitor, and control a Frame Relay/ATM PVC Service IWF.
[17] does not address point to multipoint applications of the IWF.
Implementations MAY provide support for point to multipoint capability using this MIB.
[17] for more details on the operation of a Frame Relay/ATM PVC Service IWF.
The Frame Relay/ATM PVC Service IWF managed objects are organized as follows: (1) FR/ATM PVC Service IWF cross connect table, (2) Connection description table, and
The IWF cross connect table contains one or more rows for each inter worked connection.
Each inter worked connection is uniquely identified by the frAtmIwfConnIndex object.
In the case of point to  point, a single row is present.
In the case of point to multipoint, one row exists for each multipoint destination.
Index objects for the ATM port, VPI, VCI, frame relay port, and frame relay DLCI
distinguish the constituent rows used in a point to multipoint case.
Each inter worked connection has attributes governing behavior of the IWF.
These attributes describe how the IWF should transform a PDU during the forwarding process and provide rules for:
(1) Mapping the ATM CLP bit to frame relay DE bit (2) Mapping the ATM congestion notification bit to frame relay congestion bits (3) Mapping higher protocol encapsulations between ATM and frame relay (
4) Performing fragmentation and reassembly (5)
Performing ARP translation between ATM and frame relay Typically, most connections share the same attributes.
The attributes are represented in this MIB by the connection description table.
Each row of the connection description table contains the attribute settings common to one or more inter worked connections.
One example would be full mapping and translation.
All cross connect table entries that require full mapping and translation services set the frAtmIwfConnectionDescriptor object to the index value for the connection description table row that contains objects set to values that provide full mapping and translation services.
A notification object provides cross connect status change alerts.
The Frame Relay/ATM PVC Service IWF MIB describes the cross  connections between frame relay and ATM service users.
Each PVC endpoint is provisioned and managed with a technology specific MIB as described below.
Each technology specific MIB has a table of PVC endpoints (indexed by ifIndex and logical link address such as the DLCI or VPI/VCI).
In the absence of interworking, two endpoints are cross connected via a technology specific cross connect table (e.g., the atmVcCrossConnectTable in the ATM MIB).
However, a connection between a frame relay endpoint and an ATM endpoint requires a cross  connect in the ATM IWF MIB.
The following sections describe the relationship between the technology specific MIBs and the FR/ATM PVC Service IWF MIB.
Frame Relay Service MIB Frame relay PVC endpoints are provisioned as rows in the Frame Relay Services MIB [19] endpoint table.
Each frame relay PVC endpoint is described in the frPVCEndptTable.
A connection between two frame relay endpoints is described by an entry in the frame relay PVC cross connect table frPVCConnectTable.
The frPVCEndptConnectIdentifier object of each endpoint points to the frPVCConnectTable cross connect table row for the connection.
In the case of an inter worked connection, the frPVCEndptConnectIdentifier object is set to zero.
Instead, the frPVCEndptAtmIwfConnIndex object is set to the index of the FR/ATM IWF
The frame relay PVC cross connect table (frPVCConnectTable)
does not contain an entry for the FR/ATM inter worked connection.
Note that the frPVCEndptConnectIdentifier and frPVCEndptAtmIwfConnIndex objects are set by the system as a side  effect of cross connect establishment.
Consequently, these objects are read only.
The Frame Relay DTE MIB described in [24] has no relevance to the FR/ATM PVC Service IWF MIB.
ATM MIB ATM PVC endpoints are provisioned as rows in the ATM MIB [21] virtual connection link table.
Each ATM connection endpoint is described in the atmVclTable.
A connection between two ATM endpoints is described by an entry in the ATM VCL cross connect table atmVcCrossConnectTable.
The atmVclCrossConnectIdentifier object of each endpoint points to the atmVcCrossConnectTable row for the connection.
In the case of an inter worked connection, the atmVclCrossConnectIdentifier object is set to zero.
Instead, the frAtmIwfVclCrossConnectIdentifier object in the frAtmIwfVclEntry is set to the index of the applicable FR/ATM IWF
Note that the frAtmIwfVclCrossConnectIdentifier object is defined not in the ATM MIB but in Section 5 of this MIB.
Specifically, the object is defined as a column object in a table that AUGMENTs the ATM MIB VCL table.
The ATM VCL cross connect table (atmVcCrossConnectTable) does not contain an entry for the inter worked connection.
Note that the atmVclCrossConnectIdentifier and frAtmIwfVclCrossConnectIdentifier objects are set by the system as a side effect of cross connect establishment.
Consequently, these objects are read only.
The ifIndex defined in the IF MIB [22] identifies the specific frame relay and ATM endpoint interfaces.
The values frAtmIwfConnAtmPort and frAtmIwfConnFrPort are used in this MIB as components in the index list for the frAtmIwfConnectionTable rows.
This MIB supports IWF implementations providing point to multipoint functionality.
All rows of the cross connect table indexed by the same
frAtmIwfConnIndex MUST utilize the same frAtmIwfConnectionDescriptor value.
A group of cross connect table entries indexed by the same frAtmIwfConnIndex value MUST agree on which service the multipoint operation is offered.
Two cases are possible: (1) Many frame relay PVCs cross connected to one ATM PVC, or (2)
One frame relay PVC cross connected to many ATM PVCs 3.5.
Creation Process Multiple steps are required to create a frame relay to ATM cross  connection.
First, rows must be created in the following tables: (1)
The Frame Relay Service MIB frPVCEndptTable
The ATM MIB atmVclTable (3)
The FR/ATM Service IWF MIB frAtmIwfConnectionDescriptorTable (4)
The FR/ATM Service IWF MIB frAtmIwfConnectionTable Second, the newly created rows are cross linked.
Finally, the administrative and operational status objects are set to 'up(1)'.
A step by step example is provided to illustrate the creation process.
In this example, the term "Manager" refers to a network management system that issues SNMP protocol actions to an "Agent".
The agent is integrated with the system that implements the frame relay to ATM service IWF.
In this example, the following cross  connection is created:
a) Manager requests creation of a new row in the frPVCEndptTable b)
Agent receives management request to create a row in frPVCEndptTable for the frame relay side c)
A new row is created in frPVCEndptTable as follows:
frPVCEndptAtmIwfConnIndex initialized to zero  remaining row objects initialized as needed for DLCI X on ifIndex Y Step
2 Create the ATM PVC endpoint
a) Agent receives management request to create a row in atmVclTable for the ATM side b)
A new row is created in atmVclTable and frAtmIwfVclTable (the AUGMENT to the atmVclTable) as follows:  atmVclCrossConnectIdentifier initialized to zero  frAtmIwfVclCrossConnectIdentifier initialized to zero  atmVclConnKind initialized to pvc(1)
remaining row objects initialized as needed for VPI.VCI Q.R on ifIndex S Step
3 Create the FR/ATM connection descriptor a)
If an existing connection descriptor is appropriate for the new connection, go to Step 4 using the selected connection descriptor index value L b)
Manager requests a new connection descriptor index value by reading frAtmIwfConnectionDescriptorIndexNext from the agent c
) Agent receives GET request for frAtmIwfConnectionDescriptorIndexNext and responds with the next available value L d)
Manager requests a new connection descriptor row entry using the value L as the index e) Agent receives SET request to create
the frAtmIwfConnectionDescriptorTable row entry causes the system to create a row in the table.
a) Manager requests a new cross connect index value by reading frAtmIwfConnIndexNext from the agent b)
Agent receives GET request for frAtmIwfConnIndexNext and responds with the next available value K c)
Manager requests a new cross connect row entry using the value K as the index d)
Agent receives SET request to create the frAtmIwfConnectionTable row entry (note:
the frame relay and ATM PVC endpoints MUST exist and be specified as part of the index fields for the row 'K.S.Q.R.Y.X')
e) System creates a row in frAtmIwfConnectionTable for the following indices:
frAtmIwfConnDlci of X  frAtmIwfConnectionDescriptor of L Step 5
The system sets the frame relay PVC endpoint and ATM VCL endpoint to point to the FR/ATM cross connect row (as a side effect of Step 4).
a) System sets frPVCEndptAtmIwfConnIndex to K b
) System sets frAtmIwfVclCrossConnectIdentifier to K Step 6 Manager signals activation by issuing a SET for the frAtmIwfConnAdminStatus object using the value of 'up(1)' Step 7 Agent receives SET request for frAtmIwfConnAdminStatus and executes internal system mechanisms to activate each PVC segment and the IWF
The successful activation permits the agent to respond with 'up(1)' when a GET request is received for the following fields:  frAtmIwfConnAtm2FrOperStatus  frAtmIwfConnFr2AtmOperStatus
(Note: there is no comparable FRS MIB object)
Destruction Process Destruction of the frame relay to ATM cross connection is initiated by the network management system.
The agent's processing of the request stimulates implementation specific system clean up actions.
Following removal of the row in the cross connection table, the frAtmIwfVclCrossConnectIdentifier in the frAtmIwfVclTable (AUGMENT of the ATM MIB endpoint table) and frPVCEndptAtmIwfConnIndex in the Frame Relay Service MIB endpoint table are both re initialized to zero.
A step by step example is provided to illustrate the destruction process.
Step 1 Manager requests destruction of an existing row in the frAtmIwfConnectionTable by setting frAtmIwfConnRowStatus to destroy(6)
Step 2 Agent receives the SET request and performs implementation  specific system clean up actions for the cross connection row Step 3 System updates the relevant cross connect information for the frame relay PVC endpoint by setting
frPVCEndptAtmIwfConnIndex to 0 Step 4 System updates the relevant cross connect information for the ATM PVC endpoint as follows: a) System sets frAtmIwfVclCrossConnectIdentifier to
0 b) System sets atmVclOperStatus to 'down(2)'
(Note: there is no comparable FRS MIB object)
Following the destruction of the FR/ATM cross connection entry, the manager MAY set the frPVCConnectRowStatus and/or atmVclRowStatus to destroy(6)
At the discretion of the agent, a FR/ATM cross connect may be reconfigured by adding and/or deleting leafs to/from the IWF topology as per the FR/ATM IWF cross connect creation/destruction procedures.
Reconfiguration of traffic/service category parameter values requires release of the FR/ATM IWF cross connect before those parameter values may be changed for individual frame relay or ATM endpoint segments.

current DESCRIPTION "A table in which each row represents a Frame Relay/ATM interworking connection."
"The FrAtmIwfConnectionEntry provides an entry for an interworking connection between a frame relay PVC and one or more ATM PVCs, or an ATM PVC and one or more frame relay PVCs.
A single frame relay PVC connected to a single ATM PVC is referred to as a `point to point' connection and is represented by a single row in the FR/ATM IWF Connection Table.
The case of a single frame relay PVC connected to multiple ATM PVCs (or single ATM PVC connected to multiple frame relay PVCs) is referred to as a `point to multipoint' connection and is represented by multiple rows in the FR/ATM IWF Connection Table.
The object frAtmIwfConnIndex uniquely identifies each point to point or point to multipoint connection.
The manager obtains the frAtmIwfConnIndex value by reading the frAtmIwfConnIndexNext object.
After a frAtmIwfConnIndex is assigned for the connection, the manager creates one or more rows in the Cross Connect Table; one for each cross  connection between the frame relay PVC and an ATM PVC.
In the case of `point to multipoint' connections, all rows are indexed by the same frAtmIwfConnIndex value and MUST refer to the same frame relay PVC or ATM PVC respectively.
An entry can be created only when at least one pair of frame relay and ATM PVCs exist.
A row can be established by one step set request with all required parameter values and frAtmIwfConnRowStatus set to createAndGo(4).
The Agent should perform all error checking as needed.
A pair of cross connected PVCs, as identified by a particular value of the indexes, is released by setting frAtmIwfConnRowStatus to destroy(6).
The Agent may release all associated resources.
The manager may remove the related PVCs thereafter.
Indexes are persistent across reboots of the system.

There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB that have a MAX ACCESS clause of read write and/or read create.
Such objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.
The support for SET operations in a non secure environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on network operations.
No managed objects in this MIB contain sensitive information.
by itself is not a secure environment.
Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec), even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is allowed to access and
the objects in this MIB.
It is recommended that the implementers consider the security features as provided by the SNMPv3 framework.
Specifically, the use of the User based Security Model RFC 2574 [12] and the View based Access Control Model RFC 2575
It is then a customer/user responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an instance of this MIB, is properly configured to give access to the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate rights to indeed GET or SET
