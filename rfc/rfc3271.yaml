  - "1. The Internet is for everyone\n   How easy to say - how hard to achieve!\n\
    \   How have we progressed towards this noble goal?\n   The Internet is in its\
    \ 14th year of annual doubling since 1988.\n   There are over 150 million hosts\
    \ on the Internet and an estimated 513\n   million users, world wide.\n   By 2006,\
    \ the global Internet is likely to exceed the size of the\n   global telephone\
    \ network, if it has not already become the telephone\n   network by virtue of\
    \ IP telephony.  Moreover, as many as 1.5 billion\n   Internet-enabled appliances\
    \ will have joined traditional servers,\n   desk tops and laptops as part of the\
    \ Internet family.  Pagers, cell\n   phones and personal digital assistants may\
    \ well have merged to become\n   the new telecommunications tools of the next\
    \ decade.  But even at the\n   scale of the telephone system, it is sobering to\
    \ realize that only\n   half of the Earth's population has ever made a telephone\
    \ call.\n   It is estimated that commerce on the network will reach somewhere\n\
    \   between $1.8T and $3.2T by 2003.  That is only two years from now\n   (but\
    \ a long career in Internet years).\n   The number of Internet users will likely\
    \ reach over 1000 million by\n   the end of the year 2005, but that is only about\
    \ 16% of the world's\n   population.  By 2047 the world's population may reach\
    \ about 11\n   billion.  If only 25% of the then world's population is on the\n\
    \   Internet, that will be nearly 3 billion users.\n   As high bandwidth access\
    \ becomes the norm through digital subscriber\n   loops, cable modems and digital\
    \ terrestrial and satellite radio\n   links, the convergence of media available\
    \ on the Internet will become\n   obvious.  Television, radio, telephony and the\
    \ traditional print\n   media will find counterparts on the Internet - and will\
    \ be changed in\n   profound ways by the presence of software that transforms\
    \ the one-way\n   media into interactive resources, shareable by many.\n   The\
    \ Internet is proving to be one of the most powerful amplifiers of\n   speech\
    \ ever invented.  It offers a global megaphone for voices that\n   might otherwise\
    \ be heard only feebly, if at all.  It invites and\n   facilitates multiple points\
    \ of view and dialog in ways\n   unimplementable by the traditional, one-way,\
    \ mass media.\n   The Internet can facilitate democratic practices in unexpected\
    \ ways.\n   Did you know that proxy voting for stock shareholders is now commonly\n\
    \   supported on the Internet?  Perhaps we can find additional ways in\n   which\
    \ to simplify and expand the voting franchise in other domains,\n   including\
    \ the political, as access to Internet increases.\n   The Internet is becoming\
    \ the repository of all we have accomplished\n   as a society.  It has become\
    \ a kind of disorganized \"Boswell\" of the\n   human spirit.  Be thoughtful in\
    \ what you commit to email, news\n   groups, and other Internet communication\
    \ channels - it may well turn\n   up in a web search some day.  Thanks to online\
    \ access to common\n   repositories, shared databases on the Internet are acting\
    \ to\n   accelerate the pace of research progress.\n   The Internet is moving\
    \ off the planet!  Already, interplanetary\n   Internet is part of the NASA Mars\
    \ mission program now underway at the\n   Jet Propulsion Laboratory.  By 2008\
    \ we should have a well-functioning\n   Earth-Mars network that serves as a nascent\
    \ backbone of an inter-\n   planetary system of Internets - InterPlaNet is a network\
    \ of\n   Internets!  Ultimately, we will have interplanetary Internet relays\n\
    \   in polar solar orbit so that they can see most of the planets and\n   their\
    \ associated interplanetary gateways for most, if not all of the\n   time.\n \
    \  The Internet Society is launching a new campaign to facilitate access\n   to\
    \ and use of Internet everywhere.  The campaign slogan is \"Internet\n   is for\
    \ everyone,\" but there is much work needed to accomplish this\n   objective.\n\
    \   Internet is for everyone - but it won't be if it isn't affordable by\n   all\
    \ that wish to partake of its services, so we must dedicate\n   ourselves to making\
    \ the Internet as affordable as other\n   infrastructures so critical to our well-being.\
    \  While we follow\n   Moore's Law to reduce the cost of Internet-enabling equipment,\
    \ let us\n   also seek to stimulate regulatory policies that take advantage of\
    \ the\n   power of competition to reduce costs.\n   Internet is for everyone -\
    \ but it won't be if Governments restrict\n   access to it, so we must dedicate\
    \ ourselves to keeping the network\n   unrestricted, unfettered and unregulated.\
    \  We must have the freedom\n   to speak and the freedom to hear.\n   Internet\
    \ is for everyone - but it won't be if it cannot keep up with\n   the explosive\
    \ demand for its services, so we must dedicate ourselves\n   to continuing its\
    \ technological evolution and development of the\n   technical standards the lie\
    \ at the heart of the Internet revolution.\n   Let us dedicate ourselves to the\
    \ support of the Internet Architecture\n   Board, the Internet Engineering Steering\
    \ Group, the Internet Research\n   Task Force, the Internet Engineering Task Force\
    \ and other\n   organizations dedicated to developing Internet technology as they\n\
    \   drive us forward into an unbounded future. Let us also commit\n   ourselves\
    \ to support the work of the Internet Corporation for\n   Assigned Names and Numbers\
    \ - a key function for the Internet's\n   operation.\n   Internet is for everyone\
    \ - but it won't be until in every home, in\n   every business, in every school,\
    \ in every library, in every hospital\n   in every town and in every country on\
    \ the Globe, the Internet can be\n   accessed without limitation, at any time\
    \ and in every language.\n   Internet is for everyone - but it won't be if it\
    \ is too complex to be\n   used easily by everyone.  Let us dedicate ourselves\
    \ to the task of\n   simplifying the Internet's interfaces and to educating all\
    \ that are\n   interested in its use.\n   Internet is for everyone - but it won't\
    \ be if legislation around the\n   world creates a thicket of incompatible laws\
    \ that hinder the growth\n   of electronic commerce, stymie the protection of\
    \ intellectual\n   property, and stifle freedom of expression and the development\
    \ of\n   market economies.  Let us dedicate ourselves to the creation of a\n \
    \  global legal framework in which laws work across national boundaries\n   to\
    \ reinforce the upward spiral of value that the Internet is capable\n   of creating.\n\
    \   Internet is for everyone - but it won't be if its users cannot\n   protect\
    \ their privacy and the confidentiality of transactions\n   conducted on the network.\
    \  Let us dedicate ourselves to the\n   proposition that cryptographic technology\
    \ sufficient to protect\n   privacy from unauthorized disclosure should be freely\
    \ available,\n   applicable and exportable.  Moreover, as authenticity lies at\
    \ the\n   heart of trust in networked environments, let us dedicate ourselves\n\
    \   to work towards the development of authentication methods and systems\n  \
    \ capable of supporting electronic commerce through the Internet.\n   Internet\
    \ is for everyone - but it won't be if parents and teachers\n   cannot voluntarily\
    \ create protected spaces for our young people for\n   whom the full range of\
    \ Internet content still may be inappropriate.\n   Let us dedicate ourselves to\
    \ the development of technologies and\n   practices that offer this protective\
    \ flexibility to those who accept\n   responsibility for providing it.\n   Internet\
    \ is for everyone - but it won't be if we are not responsible\n   in its use and\
    \ mindful of the rights of others who share its wealth.\n   Let us dedicate ourselves\
    \ to the responsible use of this new medium\n   and to the proposition that with\
    \ the freedoms the Internet enables\n   comes a commensurate responsibility to\
    \ use these powerful enablers\n   with care and consideration.  For those who\
    \ choose to abuse these\n   privileges, let us dedicate ourselves to developing\
    \ the necessary\n   tools to combat the abuse and punish the abuser.\n   Internet\
    \ is for everyone - even Martians!\n   I hope Internauts everywhere will join\
    \ with the Internet Society and\n   like-minded organizations to achieve this,\
    \ easily stated but hard to\n   attain goal.  As we pass the milestone of the\
    \ beginning of the third\n   millennium, what better theme could we possibly ask\
    \ for than making\n   the Internet the medium of this new millennium?\n   Internet\
    \ IS for everyone - but it won't be unless WE make it so.\n"
