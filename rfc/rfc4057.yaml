  - "1.  Introduction\n   This document describes the scenarios for IPv6 deployment\
    \ within\n   enterprise networks.  It defines a small set of basic enterprise\n\
    \   scenarios and includes pertinent questions to allow enterprise\n   administrators\
    \ to further refine their deployment scenarios.\n   Enterprise deployment requirements\
    \ are discussed in terms of\n   coexistence with IPv4 nodes, networks and applications,\
    \ and in terms\n   of basic network infrastructure requirements for IPv6 deployment.\n\
    \   The scenarios and requirements described in this document will be the\n  \
    \ basis for further analysis to determine what coexistence techniques\n   and\
    \ mechanisms are needed for enterprise IPv6 deployment.  The\n   results of that\
    \ analysis will be published in a separate document.\n   The audience for this\
    \ document is the enterprise network team\n   considering deployment of IPv6.\
    \  The document will be useful for\n   enterprise teams that will have to determine\
    \ the IPv6 transition\n   strategy for their enterprise.  It is expected those\
    \ teams include\n   members from management, network operations, and engineering.\
    \  The\n   scenarios presented provide an example set of cases the enterprise\n\
    \   can use to build an IPv6 network scenario.\n   To frame the discussion, this\
    \ document will describe a set of\n   scenarios each with a network infrastructure.\
    \  It is impossible to\n   define every possible enterprise scenario that will\
    \ apply to IPv6\n   adoption and transition.\n   Each enterprise will select the\
    \ transition that best supports their\n   business requirements.  Any attempt\
    \ to define a default or one-size-\n   fits-all transition scenario, simply will\
    \ not work.  This document\n   does not try to depict the drivers for adoption\
    \ of IPv6 by an\n   enterprise.\n   While it is difficult to quantify all the\
    \ scenarios for an enterprise\n   network team to plan for IPv6, it is possible\
    \ to depict a set of\n   abstract scenarios that will assist with planning.  This\
    \ document\n   presents three base scenarios to be used as models by enterprises\n\
    \   defining specific scenarios.\n   The first scenario assumes the enterprise\
    \ decides to deploy IPv6 in\n   conjunction with IPv4.  The second scenario assumes\
    \ the enterprise\n   decides to deploy IPv6 because of a specific set of applications\
    \ that\n   it wants to use over an IPv6 network.  The third scenario assumes an\n\
    \   enterprise is building a new network or restructuring an existing\n   network\
    \ and decides to deploy IPv6 as the predominant protocol within\n   the enterprise\
    \ coexisting with IPv4.  This document then briefly\n   reviews a set of network\
    \ infrastructure components that must be\n   analyzed, which are common to most\
    \ enterprises.\n   This document then provides three specific scenario examples\
    \ using\n   the network infrastructure components to depict the requirements.\n\
    \   These are common enterprise deployment cases to depict the challenges\n  \
    \ for the enterprise to transition a network to IPv6.\n   Next, supporting legacy\
    \ functions on the network (while the\n   transition is in process), and the network\
    \ infrastructure components\n   requiring analysis by the enterprise are discussed.\
    \  The\n   interoperation with legacy functions within the enterprise will be\n\
    \   required for all transition except possibly by a new network that\n   will\
    \ be IPv6 from inception.  The network infrastructure components\n   will depict\
    \ functions in their networks that require consideration\n   for IPv6 deployment\
    \ and transition.\n   Using the scenarios, network infrastructure components,\
    \ and examples\n   in this document, an enterprise can define its specific scenario\n\
    \   requirements.  Understanding the legacy functions and network\n   infrastructure\
    \ components required, the enterprise can determine the\n   network operations\
    \ required to deploy IPv6.  The tools and mechanisms\n   to support IPv6 deployment\
    \ operations will require enterprise\n   analysis.  The analysis to determine\
    \ the tools and mechanisms to\n   support the scenarios will be presented in subsequent\
    \ document(s).\n"

    \ set of general cases.\n   Below we use the term network infrastructure to mean\
    \ the software,\n   network operations and configuration, and methods used to\
    \ operate a\n   network in an enterprise.\n   For the base scenarios it is assumed\

  - "3.1.  Base Scenarios Defined\n   Scenario 1:   Wide-scale/total dual-stack deployment\
    \ of IPv4 and IPv6\n                 capable hosts and network infrastructure.\
    \  Enterprise\n                 with an existing IPv4 network wants to deploy\
    \ IPv6 in\n                 conjunction with their IPv4 network.\n   Assumptions:\
    \  The IPv4 network infrastructure used has an equivalent\n                 capability\
    \ in IPv6.\n   Requirements: Do not disrupt existing IPv4 network infrastructure\n\
    \                 assumptions with IPv6.  IPv6 should be equivalent or\n     \
    \            \"better\" than the network infrastructure in IPv4.\n           \
    \      However, it is understood that IPv6 is not required to\n              \
    \   solve current network infrastructure problems, not\n                 solved\
    \ by IPv4.  It may also not be feasible to deploy\n                 IPv6 on all\
    \ parts of the network immediately.\n   Scenario 2:   Sparse IPv6 dual-stack deployment\
    \ in IPv4 network\n                 infrastructure.  Enterprise with an existing\
    \ IPv4\n                 network wants to deploy a set of particular IPv6\n  \
    \               \"applications\" (application is voluntarily loosely\n       \
    \          defined here, e.g., peer to peer).  The IPv6 deployment\n         \
    \        is limited to the minimum required to operate this set\n            \
    \     of applications.\n   Assumptions:  IPv6 software/hardware components for\
    \ the application\n                 are available, and platforms for the application\
    \ are\n                 IPv6 capable.\n   Requirements: Do not disrupt IPv4 infrastructure.\n\
    \   Scenario 3:   IPv6-only network infrastructure with some IPv4-capable\n  \
    \               nodes/applications needing to communicate over the IPv6\n    \
    \             infrastructure.  Enterprise deploying a new network or\n       \
    \          restructuring an existing network, decides IPv6 is the\n          \
    \       basis for most network communication.  Some IPv4\n                 capable\
    \ nodes/applications will need to communicate\n                 over that infrastructure.\n\
    \   Assumptions:  Required IPv6 network infrastructure is available, or\n    \
    \             available over some defined timeline, supporting the\n         \
    \        enterprise plan.\n   Requirements: Interoperation and Coexistence with\

    \ best method of host configuration for its network, if it will use\n   stateless\
    \ or stateful autoconfiguration, and how autoconfiguration\n   will operate for\
    \ DNS updates.  It will also need to determine how\n   prefix delegation will\
    \ be done from their upstream provider and how\n   those prefixes will be cascaded\
    \ down to the enterprise IPv6 network.\n   The policy for DNS or choice of autoconfiguration\
    \ is out of scope for\n   this document [CONF, DHCPF, DHCPL].\n"
- title: 4.4.  Security
  contents:
  - "4.4.  Security\n   Current existing mechanisms used for IPv4 to provide security\
    \ need to\n   be supported for IPv6 within the enterprise.  IPv6 should create\
    \ no\n   new security concerns for IPv4.  The entire security infrastructure\n\
    \   currently used in the enterprise needs to be analyzed against IPv6\n   deployment\
    \ effect to determine what is supported in IPv6.  Users\n   should review other\
    \ current security IPv6 network infrastructure work\n   in the IETF and within\
    \ the industry.  Users will have to work with\n   their platform and software\
    \ providers to determine which IPv6\n   security network infrastructure components\
    \ are supported.  The\n   security filters and firewall requirements for IPv6\
    \ need to be\n   determined by the enterprise.  The policy choice of users for\n\
    \   security is beyond the scope of this document.\n"
- title: 4.5.  Applications
  contents:
  - "4.5.  Applications\n   Existing applications will need to be ported or provide\
    \ proxies to\n   support both IPv4 and IPv6 [APPS].\n"
- title: 4.6.  Network Management
  contents:
  - "4.6.  Network Management\n   The addition of IPv6 network infrastructure components\
    \ will need to\n   be managed by the enterprise network operations center.  Users\
    \ will\n   need to work with their network management platform providers to\n\
    \   determine what is supported for IPv6 while planning IPv6 adoption,\n   and\
    \ which tools are available to monitor the network.  Network\n   management will\
    \ not need to support both IPv4 and IPv6 and view nodes\n   as dual stacks.\n"
- title: 4.7.  Address Planning
  contents:
  - "4.7.  Address Planning\n   The address space within the enterprise will need\
    \ to be defined and\n   coordinated with the routing topology of the enterprise\
    \ network.  It\n   is also important to identify the pool of IPv4 address space\n\
    \   available to the enterprise to assist with IPv6 transition methods.\n"
- title: 4.8.  Multicast
  contents:
  - "4.8.  Multicast\n   Enterprises utilizing IPv4 Multicast services will need to\
    \ consider\n   how these services may be implemented operationally in an IPv6-\n\
    \   enabled environment.\n"
- title: 4.9.  Multihoming
  contents:
  - "4.9.  Multihoming\n   At this time, current IPv6 allocation policies are mandating\
    \ the\n   allocation of IPv6 address space from the upstream provider.  If an\n\
    \   enterprise is multihomed, the enterprise will have to determine how\n   it\
    \ wishes to support multihoming.  This also is an area of study\n   within the\
    \ IETF and work in progress.\n"
- title: 5.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "5.  Security Considerations\n   This document lists scenarios for the deployment\
    \ of IPv6 in\n   enterprise networks, and there are no security considerations\n\
    \   associated with making such a list.\n   There will be security considerations\
    \ for the deployment of IPv6 in\n   each of these scenarios, but they will be\
    \ addressed in the document\n   that includes the analysis of each scenario.\n"
