  - "1.  Introduction\n   In cases where a manager must obtain performance history\
    \ data about\n   the behavior of equipment it manages, several strategies can\
    \ be\n   followed in the design of a MIB that represents the managed\n   equipment,\
    \ including:\n   0  The agent counts events on a continuous basis and, whenever\n\
    \      desired, the manager obtains the value of the event counter and\n     \
    \ adjusts its understanding of the history of events at the agent.\n   0  The\
    \ agent allocates events to 'buckets' where each bucket\n      represents an interval\
    \ of time.\n   Telecommunications equipment often makes use of the latter strategy.\n\
    \   See [3][4][5][7][8] for examples.  In particular, for this equipment\n   it\
    \ is common that history data is maintained by the agent in terms of\n   fifteen\
    \ minute intervals.\n   This memo does not attempt to compare the relative merits\
    \ of\n   different strategies used to obtain history data.  Differences may\n\
    \   include polling policy, the amount of management traffic between\n   manager\
    \ and agent, agent simplicity, and 'data currentness' of the\n   data obtained\
    \ by the manager.  MIB designers should consider these\n   aspects when choosing\
    \ a particular strategy in a MIB design.\n   Instead, this memo provides definitions\
    \ that can be used in MIB\n   modules that require history data based on fifteen\
    \ minute intervals.\n   When designing a MIB module, it is often useful to define\
    \ new types\n   similar to those defined in the SMI [2].  In comparison to a type\n\
    \   defined in the SMI, each of these new types has a different name, a\n   similar\
    \ syntax, but more precise semantics.  These newly defined\n   types are termed\
    \ textual conventions, and are used for the\n   convenience of humans reading\
    \ the MIB module.  This is done through\n   Textual Conventions as defined in\
    \ RFC 2579 [1].  It is the purpose of\n   this document to define the set of textual\
    \ conventions to be used\n   when performance history based on 15 minute intervals\
    \ is kept.  The\n   performance history textual conventions defined in this memo\
    \ are\n   based on 32 bit counts.  For high capacity performance history counts\n\
    \   see [9].\n"
- title: 2.  Note on Invalid Data and Proxies
  contents:
  - "2.  Note on Invalid Data and Proxies\n   In this document, the word proxy indicates\
    \ an application which\n   receives SNMP messages and replies to them on behalf\
    \ of the devices\n   where the actual implementation resides, e.g., DS3/E3 interfaces.\n\
    \   The proxy will have already collected the information about the\n   DS3/E3\
    \ interfaces into its local database and may not necessarily\n   forward requests\
    \ to the actual DS3/E3 interface.  It is expected in\n   such an application that\
    \ there are periods of time where the proxy is\n   not communicating with the\
    \ DS3/E3 interfaces.  In these instances,\n   the proxy will not necessarily have\
    \ up-to-date configuration\n   information, and will most likely have missed the\
    \ collection of some\n   data.  Missed data collection may result in some intervals\
    \ in the\n   interval table being unavailable.\n"
- title: 3.  Note on xyzTimeElapsed
  contents:
  - "3.  Note on xyzTimeElapsed\n   While xyzTimeElapsed is defined as having a maximum,\
    \ there may be\n   cases (e.g., an adjustment in the system's time-of-day clock)\
    \ where\n   the actual value of the current interval would exceed this maximum\n\
    \   value.\n   Suppose that an agent which aligns its 15-minute measurement\n\
    \   intervals to 15-minute time-of-day (\"wall clock\") boundaries has a\n   time-of-day\
    \ clock that systematically gains time, and that a manager\n   periodically corrects\
    \ the clock by setting it back.\n   It is assumed that the agent's time-of-day\
    \ clock is reasonably\n   accurate, say within a few seconds per day.  Thus, the\
    \ manager's\n   periodic clock adjustments will normally be small, and if done\n\
    \   frequently enough, need not ever exceed 10 seconds.  In this case,\n   all\
    \ interval durations will be within the allowed tolerance and none\n   need be\
    \ marked invalid, _if_ the ANSI procedure of ending measurement\n   intervals\
    \ at 15-minute time-of-day boundaries is followed [6].\n   If the time-of-day\
    \ clock is systematically adjusted in small\n   increments, then always ending\
    \ measurement intervals at 15-minute\n   time-of-day boundaries will result, in\
    \ the long term, in the correct\n   number of intervals with the correct average\
    \ duration, irrespective\n   of whether the clock is moved ahead or moved back.\
    \  Thus, if for some\n   reason, such as an adjustment in the system's time-of-day\
    \ clock, the\n   current interval exceeds the maximum value, it is considered\n\
    \   acceptable that the agent will return the maximum value.\n"
