  - "Abstract\n   This document describes a Uniform Resource Name (URN) namespace\
    \ that\n   is engineered by the TV-Anytime Forum for naming persistent resources\n\
    \   published by the TV-Anytime Forum including the TV-Anytime Forum\n   Standards,\
    \ XML (Extensible Markup Language) Document Type\n   Definitions, XML Schemas,\
    \ Namespaces, and other documents.\n"
- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   The TV-Anytime Forum produces many kinds of documents (i.e.,\n\
    \   specifications, working documents, and schemas) that are currently\n   being\
    \ considered for adoption by many standardization bodies such as\n   ETSI (European\
    \ Telecommunication Standardization Institute), DVB\n   (Digital Video Broadcasting),\
    \ ARIB (Association of Radio Industries\n   and Businesses), and ATSC (Advance\
    \ Television Systems Committee).\n   The TV-Anytime Forum wishes to provide global,\
    \ distributed,\n   persistent, location-independent names for these resources.\n"

    \ of structure:\n      The Namespace Specific String (NSS) of all URNs assigned\
    \ by the\n      TV-Anytime Forum will have the following hierarchical structure:\n\
    \                  urn:tva:{category}:{string}\n      where the \"category\" is\
    \ a US-ASCII string that conforms to URN\n      syntax requirements ([RFC2141]),\
    \ and \"{string}\" is a string that\n      confirms to URN syntax requirements\
    \ ([RFC2141]).\n   Relevant ancillary documentation:\n      The TV-Anytime Forum\
    \ specifications have been publicly available\n      at all stages during their\
    \ development from\n      \"ftp://tva:tva@ftp.bbc.co.uk/Specifications/\".  The\
    \ final\n      specifications are also available as formal ETSI (European\n  \
    \    Telecommunication Standardization Institute) technical\n      specification\
    \ documents, ETSI TS 102 822 series.\n   Identifier uniqueness considerations:\n\
    \      The TV-Anytime Forum shall establish unique identifiers as\n      appropriate.\n\
    \      Uniqueness is guaranteed as long as the assigned \"{category}\" is\n  \
    \    never reassigned for other categories.  The TV-Anytime Forum is\n      responsible\
    \ for this.\n   Identifier persistence considerations:\n      The TV-Anytime Forum\
    \ is committed to maintaining the accessibility\n      and persistence of all\
    \ resources that are officially assigned URNs\n      by the organization.  Persistence\
    \ of identifiers is dependent upon\n      suitable delegation at the level of\
    \ \"category\"s, and persistence\n      of category assignment.\n   Process of\
    \ identifier assignment:\n      All the assignments of identifiers are fully controlled\
    \ and\n      managed by the TV-Anytime Forum.\n   Process of identifier resolution:\n\
    \      The namespace is not listed with an RDS; this is not relevant.\n   Rules\
    \ for Lexical Equivalence:\n      The \"{category}\" is case-insensitive.  Thus,\
    \ the portion of the\n      URN:\n                  urn:tva:{category}:\n    \
    \  is case-insensitive for matches.  The remainder of the identifier\n      shall\
    \ be considered case-sensitive; hence, URNs are only lexically\n      equivalent\
    \ if they are also lexically identical in the remaining\n      {string} field.\n\
    \   Conformance with URN Syntax:\n      No special considerations.\n   Validation\
    \ mechanism:\n      Validation shall be done by a syntax grammar corresponding\
    \ to each\n      \"{category}\".\n   Scope:\n      Global.\n"

- title: 4.  Community Considerations
  contents:
  - "4.  Community Considerations\n   The names in this namespace are to be used in\
    \ any public\n   implementations of the TV-Anytime Forum specifications so that\n\
    \   anybody can benefit from the officially assigned namespace.\n   Potential\
    \ beneficiary communities include:\n   a) Implementers of the TV-Anytime specifications.\n\
    \      Resources that comply with the TV-Anytime Forum specifications\n      (including\
    \ TV-Anytime schemas, instance documents that comply with\n      TV-Anytime schemas,\
    \ and TV-Anytime default Classification Schemes)\n      may, by means of the registered\
    \ namespace, become exposed to the\n      general Internet and gain from the interoperability\
    \ benefits of\n      the Internet at large.\n   b) Implementers of other specifications\
    \ that incorporate components\n      of the TV-Anytime specifications.\n     \
    \ URNs used to identify TV-Anytime components may be used to enable\n      their\
    \ inclusion in, and enhancement of, other specifications while\n      maintaining,\
    \ to a certain degree, interoperability with the TV-\n      Anytime community\
    \ (see a) above).\n   c) Implementers of other semantically related specifications\
    \ that do\n      not directly incorporate components of the TV-Anytime\n     \
    \ specifications.\n      URNs used to identify components of the TV-Anytime specifications,\n\
    \      such as identifiers of terms within default Classification\n      Schemes,\
    \ may enable interoperation with other semantically\n      determined specifications\
    \ (including present and future\n      metadata/resource description and ontology\
    \ specifications) of\n      relevance to TV-Anytime implementation communities\
    \ (see a) and b)\n      above).\n"
- title: 5.  Namespace Considerations
  contents:
  - "5.  Namespace Considerations\n   This application requires a unique namespace\
    \ because the assignment\n   mechanism requires delegation to the TV-Anytime Forum.\
    \  As a\n   namespace used to identify components of the TV-Anytime\n   specifications,\
    \ the TV-Anytime Forum will manage the inter-\n   relationship of the components\
    \ and the uniqueness of the identifiers.\n"

  contents:
  - "6.  Security Considerations\n   There are no additional security considerations\
    \ other than those\n   normally associated with the use and resolution of URNs\
    \ in general.\n"
