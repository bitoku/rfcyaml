- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   This memo updates the IANA registry rules for the Telephony\
    \ Routing\n   over IP (TRIP) protocol, by no longer requiring that postal addresses\n\
    \   be included in contact information.  No use for the addresses is\n   identified,\
    \ and omitting this information provides a privacy benefit.\n   This memo updates\
    \ RFC 3219.\n"
- title: 2.  IANA Considerations
  contents:
  - "2.  IANA Considerations\n   This memo updates the registration rules [RFC8126]\
    \ for TRIP\n   Attributes ([RFC3219], Section 13.2) and TRIP IP Telephony\n  \
    \ Administrative Domain (ITAD) Numbers ([RFC3219], Section 13.5) as\n   follows.\n\
    \   The IETF no longer requires IANA to collect postal address\n   information\
    \ when adding TRIP registry entries.  Additionally, IANA\n   has removed previously\
    \ collected postal addresses from the\n   registries.\n"
