  - "Referring to NWG/RFC: 11, it appears that file transmissions over\nauxiliary\
    \ connections will require some mechanism to specify \"END-OF-\nFILE.\"  It is\
    \ proposed that a length 0 (zero) message be used for this\npurpose.  Figure 1\
    \ shows the format:\n|<---32 bits--->|<---32 bits--->|<----16 bits---->|<------?------>|\n\
    |    leader     |    marking    |    checksum     |    padding    |\n        \
    \              Zero Text Length EOF Message\n       [ This RFC was put into machine\
    \ readable form for entry ]\n      [ into the online RFC archives by Michael Brunnbauer\
    \ 1/97 ]\n"
