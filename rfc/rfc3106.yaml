    \   information at an Internet merchant site in order to complete a\n   purchase\
    \ or other transaction, especially the first time they go\n   there.  A standard\
    \ set of information fields is defined as the first\n   version of an Electronic\
    \ Commerce Modeling Language (ECML) so that\n   this task can be more easily automated,\
    \ for example by wallet\n   software that could fill in fields.  Even for the\
    \ manual data entry\n   case, customers will be less confused by varying merchant\
    \ sites if a\n   substantial number adopt these standard fields.  In addition,\
    \ some\n   fields are defined for merchant to consumer communication.\n"

- title: 1. Introduction

  - "1. Introduction\n   Today, numerous merchants are successfully conducting business\
    \ on the\n   Internet using HTML-based forms.  The data formats used in these\n\
    \   forms vary considerably from one merchant to another.  End-users find\n  \
    \ the diversity confusing and the process of manually filling in these\n   forms\
    \ to be tedious.  The result is that many merchant forms,\n   reportedly around\
    \ two thirds, are abandoned during the fill in\n   process.\n   Software tools\
    \ called electronic wallets can help this situation.  A\n   digital wallet is\
    \ an application or service that assists consumers in\n   conducting online transactions\
    \ by allowing them to store billing,\n   shipping, payment, and preference information\
    \ and to use this\n   information to automatically complete merchant interactions.\
    \  This\n   greatly simplifies the check-out process and minimizes the need for\
    \ a\n   consumer to think about and complete a merchant's form every time.\n \
    \  Digital wallets that fill forms have been successfully built into\n   browsers,\
    \ as proxy servers, as helper applications to browsers, as\n   stand-alone applications,\
    \ as browser plug-ins, and as server-based\n   applications.  But the proliferation\
    \ of electronic wallets has been\n   hampered by the lack of standards.\n   ECML\
    \ (Electronic Commerce Modeling Language, <www.ecml.org>) provides\n   a set of\
    \ simple guidelines for web merchants that will enable\n   electronic wallets\
    \ from multiple vendors to fill in their web forms.\n   The end-result is that\
    \ more consumers will find shopping on the web\n   to be easy and compelling.\n\
    \   Version 1.1 has been enhanced over Version 1.0 [RFC 2706] as\n   described\
    \ in the appendix to this document.  These enhancements\n   include support for\
    \ communication from the merchant to the wallet.\n   This information can be used\
    \ by the wallet to present transaction\n   information and possibly signed receipts.\
    \  The format of the\n   signatures for receipts is not specified in this document.\n\
    \   Multiple wallets and multiple merchants interoperably support ECML.\n   This\
    \ is an open standard.  ECML is designed to be simple.  Neither\n   Version 1.0\
    \ nor Version 1.1 of the project add new technology to the\n   web.  A merchant\
    \ can adopt ECML and gain the support of these\n   multiple Wallets by making\
    \ very simple changes to their site.  Use of\n   ECML requires no license.\n"

  - "1.1 The ECML Alliance\n   The set of fields documented herein was developed by\
    \ the ECML\n   Alliance (www.ecml.org) which now includes, in alphabetic order,\

    \   Members some of whom are listed on the ECML web site.\n             1. American\

- title: 1.2 Relationship to Other Standards
  contents:
  - "1.2 Relationship to Other Standards\n   The ECML fields were initially derived\
    \ from and are consistent with\n   the W3C P3P base data schema at\n         <http://www.w3.org/TR/WD-P3P/basedata.html>.\n\
    \   ECML Version 1.1 is not a replacement or alternative to SSL/TLS [RFC\n   2246],\
    \ SET [SET], XML [XML], or IOTP [RFC 2801].  These are important\n   standards\
    \ that provide functionality such as non-repudiatable\n   transactions, automatable\
    \ payment scheme selection, and smart card\n   support.\n   ECML may be used with\
    \ any payment mechanism.  It simply allows a\n   merchant to publish consistent\
    \ simple web forms.  Information on the\n   use of the ECML fields with W3C P3P\
    \ protocol is available at\n   <http://www.w3.org/TR/P3P-for-ecommerce> which\
    \ also includes some\n   proposed extension fields.  These extension fields may\
    \ be included in\n   a future version of ECML.\n"
- title: 1.3 Areas Deferred to Future Versions
  contents:
  - "1.3 Areas Deferred to Future Versions\n   Considerations for business purchasing\
    \ cards, non-card payment\n   mechanisms, wallet activation, privacy related mechanisms,\
    \ additional\n   payment mechanisms, currency exchange, and any sort of \"negotiation\"\
    \n   were among the areas deferred to consideration in future versions.\n   Hidden\
    \ or other special fields were minimized.\n"
- title: 2. Field Definitions and DTD
  contents:
  - "2. Field Definitions and DTD\n   The ECML Standard is primarily the definition\
    \ and naming of fields.\n   These fields can be encoded in a variety of syntaxes\
    \ and protocols.\n   Section 2.1 below lists and describes the fields, Section\
    \ 2.2 gives\n   additional notes on HTML usage of the fields, and Section 2.3\n\
    \   provides an XML DTD for use with the fields.\n"
- title: 2.1 Field List and Descriptions
  contents:
  - "2.1 Field List and Descriptions\n   The fields are listed below along with the\
    \ minimum data entry size to\n   allow.  Note that these fields are hierarchically\
    \ organized as\n   indicated by the embedded underscore (\"_\") characters.  Appropriate\n\
    \   data transmission mechanisms may use this to request and send\n   aggregates,\
    \ such as Ecom_Payment_Card_ExpDate to encompass all the\n   date components or\
    \ Ecom_ShipTo to encompass all the ship to\n   components that the consumer is\
    \ willing to provide.  The labeling,\n   marshalling, unmarshalling of the components\
    \ of such aggregates\n   depends on the data transfer protocol used.\n"
- title: 2.1.1 Field List
  contents:
  - "2.1.1 Field List\n   IMPORTANT NOTE: \"MIN\" in the table below is the MINIMUM\
    \ DATA SIZE TO\n         ALLOW FOR ON DATA ENTRY.  It is NOT the minimum size\
    \ for valid\n         contents of the field and merchant software should, in most\n\
    \         cases, be prepared to receive a longer or shorter value.\n         Merchant\
    \ dealing with areas where, for example, the\n         state/province name or\
    \ phone number is longer than the \"Min\"\n         given below must obviously\
    \ permit longer data entry.  In some\n         cases, however, there is a maximum\
    \ size that makes sense and\n         where this is the case, it is documented\
    \ in a Note for the\n         field.\n         The following fields are used to\
    \ communicate from the customer\n         to the merchant:\n   FIELD         \
    \              NAME                         Min  Notes\n"

  - "2.1.2 Field Foot Notes\n   ( 1) For example: Mr., Mrs., Ms., Dr.  This field\
    \ is commonly not\n   used.\n   ( 2) May also be used for middle initial.\n  \
    \ ( 3) For example: Ph.D., Jr. (Junior), 3rd, Esq. (Esquire).  This\n   field\
    \ is commonly not used.\n   ( 4) Address lines must be filled in the order line1,\
    \ then line2, and\n   last line3.\n   ( 5) 2 characters are the minimum for the\
    \ US and Canada, other\n   countries may require longer fields.  For the US use\
    \ 2 character US\n   Postal state abbreviation.\n   ( 6) Minimum field lengths\
    \ for Postal Code will vary based on\n   international market served.  Use 5 character\
    \ or 5+4 ZIP for the US\n   and 6 character postal code for Canada.  The size\
    \ given, 14, is\n   believed to be the maximum required anywhere in the world.\n\
    \   ( 7) Use [ISO 3166] standard two letter codes.  See\n   <http://www.din.de/gremien/nas/nabd/iso3166ma/index.html>\
    \ for country\n   names.\n   ( 8) 10 digits are the minimum for numbers local\

    \ and a\n   number of smaller Caribbean and Pacific nations (but not Cuba)),\n\
    \   other countries may require longer fields.  Telephone numbers are\n   complicated\
    \ by differing international access codes, variant\n   punctuation of area/city\
    \ codes within countries, confusion caused by\n   the fact that the international\
    \ access code in the NANP region is\n   usually the same as the \"country code\"\
    \ for that area (1), etc.  It\n   will probably be necessary to use heuristics\
    \ or human examination\n   based on the telephone number and addresses given to\
    \ figure out how\n   to actually call a customer.  It is recommend that an \"\
    x\" be placed\n   before extension numbers.\n   ( 9) For example:  jsmith@example.com\n\

    \ CIV, MasterCard's CVC2, and Visa's CVV2 values.\n   (14) The day of the month.\
    \  Values: 1-31.  A leading zero is ignored\n   so, for example, 07 is valid for\
    \ the seventh day of the month.\n   (15) The month of the year.  Jan - 1, Feb\
    \ - 2, March - 3, etc.;\n   Values: 1-12.  A leading zero is ignored so, for example,\

    \ digits, e.g., 1999,\n   2000, 2001, ...\n   (17) A space separated list of protocols\
    \ available in connection with\n   the specified card.  Initial list of case insensitive\
    \ tokens:\n            none\n            set\n            setcert\n          \

    \ indicates usable with SET protocol (i.e., is in a SET wallet)\n   but does not\
    \ have a SET certificate.  \"Setcert\" indicates same but\n   does have a set\
    \ certificate.  \"iotp\" indicates the IOTP protocol [RFC\n   2801] is supported\
    \ at the customer.  \"echeck\" indicates that the\n   eCheck protocol [eCheck]\
    \ is supported at the customer.  \"simcard\"\n   indicates use the transaction\

    None\" indicates\n   that automatic field fill is operating but there is no SET\
    \ wallet or\n   the card is not entered in any SET wallet.\n   (18) A unique order\
    \ ID generated by the consumer software.\n   (19) The user ID and password fields\
    \ are used in cases where the user\n   has a pre-established account with the\
    \ merchant.\n   (20) URI indicating version of this set of fields.  Usually a\
    \ hidden\n   field.  Equal to \"http://www.ecml.org/version/1.1\" for this version.\n\
    \   (21) A string to identify the source and version of the form fill\n   software\
    \ that is acting on behalf of the user.  Should contain\n   company and/or product\
    \ name and version.  Example \"Wallets Inc.,\n   SuperFill, v42.7\".  Usually\
    \ a hidden field.\n   (22) A flag to indicate that this web-page/aggregate is\
    \ the final one\n   for this transaction.  Usually a hidden field.\n   (23) Merchant\
    \ domain name such as www.merchant.example.  This is\n   usually a hidden field.\n\
    \   (24) Gateway transaction processor who is actually accepting the\n   payment\
    \ on behalf of the merchant in home domain such as\n   www.processor.example.\
    \  This is usually a hidden field.\n   (25) A Transaction identification string\
    \ whose format is specific to\n   the processor.  This is usually a hidden field.\n\
    \   (26) A URL that can be invoke to inquire about the transaction.  This\n  \
    \ is usually a hidden field.\n   (27) The amount of the transaction in ISO currency\
    \ format.  This is\n   two integer numbers with a period in between but no other\
    \ currency\n   marks (such as a $ dollar sign).  This is usually a hidden field.\n\
    \   (28) This is the three letter ISO currency code.  For example, for US\n  \
    \ dollars it is USD.  This is usually a hidden field.\n   (29) ISO Transaction\
    \ date.  This is usually a hidden field.\n   (30) The type of the transaction\
    \ (either debit or credit) if known.\n   This is usually a hidden field.\n   (31)\
    \ The signature of the encoded certificate.  This is usually a\n   hidden field.\n\
    \   (32) The Receipt To fields are used when the Bill To entity,\n   location,\
    \ or address and the Receipto entity, location, or address\n   are different.\
    \  For example, when using some forms of Corporate\n   Purchasing Cards or Agent\
    \ Purchasing Cards, the individual card\n   holder would be in the Receipt To\
    \ fields and the corporate or other\n   owner would be in the Bill To fields.\n"

- title: 3. Using The Fields
  contents:
  - "3. Using The Fields\n   To conform to this document, the field names must be\
    \ structured and\n   named as close to the structure and naming listed in Section\
    \ 2 above\n   as permitted by the transaction protocol in use.  Note: this does\
    \ not\n   impose any restriction on the user visible labeling of fields, just\n\
    \   on their names as used in communication.\n"
- title: 3.1 Presentation of the Fields
  contents:
  - "3.1 Presentation of the Fields\n   There is no necessary implication as to the\
    \ order or manner of\n   presentation.  Some merchants may wish to ask for more\
    \ information,\n   some less by omitting fields.  Some merchants may ask for the\n\
    \   information they want in one interaction or web page, others may ask\n   for\
    \ parts of the information at different times in multiple\n   interactions or\
    \ different web pages.  For example, it is common to\n   ask for \"ship to\" information\
    \ earlier, so shipping cost can be\n   computed, before the payment method information.\
    \  Some merchants may\n   require that all the information they request be provided\
    \ while other\n   make much information optional.  Etc.\n   There is no way with\
    \ Version 1.0 or 1.1 of ECML to indicate what\n   fields the merchant considers\
    \ mandatory.  From the point of view of\n   customer software, all fields are\
    \ optional to complete.  However, the\n   merchant may give an error or re-present\
    \ a request for information if\n   some field it requires is not completed, just\
    \ as it may if a field is\n   completed in a manner it considers erroneous.\n\
    \   It is entirely up to the merchant when and which, if any, of the\n   merchant\
    \ to consumer fields it presents.\n"
- title: 3.2 Methods and Flow of Setting the Fields
  contents:
  - "3.2 Methods and Flow of Setting the Fields\n   There are a variety of methods\
    \ of communication possible between the\n   customer and the merchant by which\
    \ the merchant can indicate what\n   fields they want that the consumer can provide.\
    \  Probably the easiest\n   to use for currently deployed software is as fields\
    \ in an [HTML] form\n   (see section 2.2).  Other possibilities are to use the\
    \ IOTP\n   Authenticate transaction [RFC 2801], an [XML] exchange, or\n   proprietary\
    \ protocols.\n   User action or the appearance of the Ecom_SchemaVersion field\
    \ are\n   examples of triggers that could be used to initiate a facility\n   capable\
    \ of filling in fields.  Because some wallets may require user\n   activation,\
    \ there should be at least one user visible Ecom field on\n   every page with\
    \ any Ecom fields present that are to be filled in.  It\n   is also REQUIRED that\
    \ the Ecom_SchemaVersion field, which is usually\n   a hidden field, be included\
    \ on every web page that has any Ecom\n   fields.\n   Because web pages can load\
    \ very slowly, it may not be clear to an\n   automated field fill-in function\
    \ when it is finished filling in\n   fields on a web page.  For this reason, it\
    \ is recommended that the\n   Ecom_SchemaVersion field be the last Ecom field\
    \ on a web page.\n   Merchant requests for information can extend over several\n\
    \   interactions or web pages.  Without further provision, a facility\n   could\
    \ either require re-starting on each page or possibly violate or\n   appear to\
    \ violate privacy by continuing to fill in fields for pages\n   beyond with end\
    \ of the transaction with a particular merchant.  For\n   this reason the Ecom_TransactionComplete\
    \ field, which is normally\n   hidden, is provided.  It is recommended that it\
    \ appear on the last\n   interaction or web page involved in a transaction, just\
    \ before an\n   Ecom_SchemaVersion field, so that multi-web-page automated field\
    \ fill\n   in logic could know when to stop if it chooses to check for this\n\
    \   field.\n"

  - "4. Security and Privacy Considerations\n   The information called for by many\
    \ of these fields is sensitive and\n   should be secured if being sent over the\
    \ public Internet or through\n   other channels where it can be observed.  Mechanisms\
    \ for such\n   protection are not specified herein but channel encryption such\
    \ as\n   TLS/SSL [RFC 2246] or IPSec [RFC 2411] would be appropriate in many\n\
    \   cases.\n   User control over release of such information is needed to protect\n\
    \   the user's privacy.\n   A wallet that is installed on a shared or public terminal\
    \ should be\n   configurable such that the ECML memory of address and other contact\n\
    \   information is fully disabled.  This is vital to protect the privacy\n   of\
    \ library patrons, students, and customers using public terminals,\n   and children\
    \ who might, for example, use a form on a public terminal\n   without realizing\
    \ that their information is being stored.\n   When contact information is stored,\
    \ the operator should have an\n   option to protect the information with a password,\
    \ without which the\n   information might be unavailable, even to someone who\
    \ has access to\n   the file(s) in which it is being stored.  This would also\
    \ allow for a\n   convenient method for multiple people to use their own ECML\n\
    \   information from the same browser.\n   Any multi-web-page or other multi-aggregate\
    \ field fill in or data\n   provision mechanism should check for the Ecom_TransactionComplete\n\
    \   field and cease automated fill when it is encountered until fill is\n   further\
    \ authorized.\n"
