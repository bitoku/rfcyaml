  - "1.  Introduction\n   The Internet Key Exchange Protocol Version 2 [RFC7296] can
    use\n   arbitrary signature algorithms as described in [RFC7427].  [RFC7427]\n
    \  defines the SIGNATURE_HASH_ALGORITHMS notification where each side of\n   the
    IKE negotiation lists its supported hash algorithms.  This\n   assumes that all
    signature schemes involve a hashing phase followed\n   by a signature phase.  This
    made sense because most signature\n   algorithms either cannot sign messages bigger
    than their key or\n   truncate messages bigger than their key.\n   EdDSA [RFC8032]
    defines signature methods that do not require\n   prehashing of the message.  Unlike
    other methods, these accept\n   messages of arbitrary size, so no prehashing is
    required.  These\n   methods are called Ed25519 and Ed448; they use the Edwards
    25519 and\n   the Edwards 448 (\"Goldilocks\") curves, respectively.  Although
    that\n   document also defines prehashed versions of these algorithms, those\n
    \  versions are not recommended for protocols where there is minimal\n   burden
    in buffering the entire message so as to make it practical to\n   make two passes
    over the message.  This is true of IKEv2.  See\n   Section 8.5 of [RFC8032] for
    that recommendation.\n   EdDSA defines the binary format of the signatures that
    should be used\n   in the \"Signature Value\" field of the Authentication Data
    Format in\n   Section 3 of RFC 8032.  [RFC8410] defines the object identifiers\n
    \  (OIDs) for these signature methods.  For convenience, these OIDs are\n   repeated
    in Appendix A.\n   In order to signal within IKE that no hashing needs to be done,
    we\n   define a new value in the SIGNATURE_HASH_ALGORITHMS notification to\n   indicate
    that no hashing is performed.\n"

    title: 1.1.  Conventions Used in This Document
  title: 1.  Introduction
- contents:
  - "2.  The \"Identity\" Hash Identifier\n   This document defines a new value called
    \"Identity\" (5) in the \"IKEv2\n   Hash Algorithms\" registry for use in the
    SIGNATURE_HASH_ALGORITHMS\n   notification.  Inserting this new value into the
    notification\n   indicates that the receiver supports at least one signature algorithm\n
    \  that accepts messages of arbitrary size such as Ed25519 and Ed448.\n   Ed25519
    and Ed448 are only defined with the \"Identity\" hash and MUST\n   NOT be sent
    to a receiver that has not indicated support for the\n   \"Identity\" hash.\n
    \  The prehashed versions of Ed25519 and Ed448 (Ed25519ph and Ed448ph,\n   respectively)
    MUST NOT be used in IKE.\n"
  title: 2.  The "Identity" Hash Identifier
- contents:
  - "3.  Security Considerations\n   The new \"Identity\" value is needed only for
    signature algorithms that\n   accept an input of arbitrary size.  It MUST NOT
    be used if none of\n   the supported and configured algorithms have this property.
    \ On the\n   other hand, there is no good reason to prehash the inputs where the\n
    \  signature algorithm has that property.  For this reason,\n   implementations
    MUST have the \"Identity\" value in the\n   SIGNATURE_HASH_ALGORITHMS notification
    when EdDSA is supported and\n   configured.  Implementations SHOULD NOT have other
    hash algorithms in\n   the notification if all supported and configured signature
    algorithms\n   have this property.\n"

    the name\n   \"Identity\" in the \"IKEv2 Hash Algorithms\" registry with this
