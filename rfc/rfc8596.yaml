  - "1.  Introduction\n   As discussed in [RFC8300], a number of transport encapsulations\
    \ for\n   the Service Function Chaining (SFC) Network Service Header (NSH)\n \
    \  already exist, such as Ethernet, UDP, GRE, and others.\n   This document describes\
    \ an MPLS transport encapsulation for the NSH\n   and how to use a Service Function\
    \ Forwarder (SFF) [RFC7665] Label to\n   indicate the presence of the NSH in the\
    \ MPLS packet payload.  This\n   allows SFC packets using the NSH to be forwarded\
    \ between SFFs in an\n   MPLS transport network, where MPLS is used to interconnect\
    \ the\n   network nodes that contain one or more SFFs.  The label is also used\n\
    \   to select between multiple SFFs in the destination MPLS node.\n   From an\
    \ SFC perspective, this encapsulation is equivalent to other\n   transport encapsulations\
    \ of packets using the NSH.  This can be\n   illustrated by adding an additional\
    \ line to the example of a next-hop\n   SPI / SI-to-network (\"SPI\" and \"SI\"\
    \ stand for \"Service Path\n   Identifier\" and \"Service Index\") overlay network\
    \ locator mapping in\n   Table 1 of [RFC8300]:\n     +------+------+---------------------+-------------------------+\n\

    \                 Table 1: Extension to Table 1 in RFC 8300\n   SFF Labels are\
    \ similar to other service labels at the bottom of an\n   MPLS label stack that\
    \ denote the contents of the MPLS payload being\n   other than a normally routed\
    \ IP packet, such as a Layer 2 pseudowire,\n   an IP packet that is routed in\
    \ a VPN context with a private address,\n   or an Ethernet virtual private wire\
    \ service.\n   This informational document follows well-established MPLS procedures\n\
    \   and does not require any actions by IANA or any new protocol\n   extensions.\n\
    \   Note that using the MPLS label stack as a replacement for the SFC\n   NSH,\
    \ covering use cases that do not require per-packet metadata, is\n   described\
    \ in [RFC8595].\n"

- title: 2.  MPLS Encapsulation Using an SFF Label
  contents:
  - "2.  MPLS Encapsulation Using an SFF Label\n   The encapsulation is a standard\
    \ MPLS label stack [RFC3032] with an\n   SFF Label at the bottom of the stack,\
    \ followed by an NSH as defined\n   by [RFC8300] and the NSH original packet/frame.\n\
    \   Much like a pseudowire label, an SFF Label MUST be allocated by the\n   downstream\
    \ receiver of the NSH from its per-platform label space,\n   since the meaning\
    \ of the label is identical, independent of which\n   incoming interface it is\
    \ received from [RFC3031].\n   If a receiving node supports more than one SFF\
    \ (i.e., more than one\n   SFC forwarding instance), then the SFF Label can be\
    \ used to select\n   the proper SFF, by having the receiving node advertise more\
    \ than one\n   SFF Label to its upstream sending nodes as appropriate.\n   The\
    \ method used by the downstream receiving node to advertise SFF\n   Labels to\
    \ the upstream sending node is out of scope for this\n   document.  That said,\
    \ a number of methods are possible, such as via a\n   protocol exchange, or via\
    \ a controller that manages both the sender\n   and the receiver using the Network\
    \ Configuration Protocol\n   (NETCONF) / YANG, BGP, the Path Computation Element\
    \ Communication\n   Protocol (PCEP), etc.  One such BGP-based method has already\
    \ been\n   defined and is documented in [BGP-NSH-SFC].  This does not constrain\n\
    \   the further definition of other such advertisement methods in the\n   future.\n\
    \   While the SFF Label will usually be at the bottom of the label stack,\n  \
    \ there may be cases where there are additional label stack entries\n   beneath\
    \ it.  For example, when an Associated Channel Header (ACH) is\n   carried that\
    \ applies to the SFF, a Generic Associated Channel Label\n   (GAL) [RFC5586] will\
    \ be in the label stack below the SFF.  Similarly,\n   an Entropy Label Indicator\
    \ / Entropy Label (ELI/EL) [RFC6790] may be\n   carried below the SFF in the label\
    \ stack.  This is identical to the\n   situation with VPN labels.\n   This document\
    \ does not define the setting of the Traffic Class (TC)\n   field [RFC5462] (formerly\
    \ known as the Experimental Use (EXP) bits\n   [RFC3032]) in the SFF Label.\n"
- title: 2.1.  MPLS Label Stack Construction at the Sending Node
  contents:
  - "2.1.  MPLS Label Stack Construction at the Sending Node\n   When one SFF wishes\
    \ to send an SFC packet with an NSH to another SFF\n   over an MPLS transport\
    \ network, a label stack needs to be constructed\n   by the MPLS node that contains\
    \ the sending SFF in order to transport\n   the packet to the destination MPLS\
    \ node that contains the receiving\n   SFF.  The label stack is constructed as\
    \ follows:\n   1.  Push zero or more labels that are interpreted by the destination\n\
    \       MPLS node on to the packet, such as the GAL [RFC5586] (see\n       Section\
    \ 4).  The TTL for these labels is set according to the\n       relevant standards\
    \ that define these labels.\n   2.  Push the SFF Label to identify the desired\
    \ SFF in the receiving\n       MPLS node.  The TTL for this MPLS label MUST be\
    \ set to 1 to avoid\n       mis-forwarding.\n   3.  Push zero or more additional\
    \ labels such that (a) the resulting\n       label stack will cause the packet\
    \ to be transported to the\n       destination MPLS node, and (b) when the packet\
    \ arrives at the\n       destination node, either:\n       *  the SFF Label will\
    \ be at the top of the label stack (this is\n          typically the case when\
    \ penultimate hop popping is used at the\n          penultimate node), or\n  \
    \     *  as a part of normal MPLS processing, the SFF Label becomes the\n    \
    \      top label in the stack before the packet is forwarded to\n          another\
    \ node and before the packet is dispatched to a higher\n          layer.\n   \
    \   The TTL for these labels is set by configuration or set to the\n      defaults\
    \ for normal MPLS operation in the network.\n"
- title: 2.2.  SFF Label Processing at the Destination Node
  contents:
  - "2.2.  SFF Label Processing at the Destination Node\n   The destination MPLS node\
    \ performs a lookup on the SFF Label to\n   retrieve the next-hop context between\
    \ the SFF and SF, e.g., to\n   retrieve the destination Media Access Control (MAC)\
    \ address in the\n   case where native Ethernet encapsulation is used between\
    \ the SFF and\n   SF.  How the next-hop context is populated is out of scope for\
    \ this\n   document.\n   The receiving SFF SHOULD check that the received SFF\
    \ Label has a TTL\n   of 1 upon receipt.  Any other values indicate a likely error\n\
    \   condition and SHOULD result in discarding the packet.\n   The receiving MPLS\
    \ node then pops the SFF Label (and any labels\n   beneath it) so that the destination\
    \ SFF receives the SFC packet with\n   the NSH at the top of the packet.\n"
- title: 3.  Equal-Cost Multipath (ECMP) Considerations
  contents:
  - "3.  Equal-Cost Multipath (ECMP) Considerations\n   As discussed in [RFC4928]\
    \ and [RFC7325], there are ECMP\n   considerations for payloads carried by MPLS.\n\
    \   Many existing routers use deep packet inspection to examine the\n   payload\
    \ of an MPLS packet.  If the first nibble of the payload is\n   equal to 0x4 or\
    \ 0x6, these routers (sometimes incorrectly, as\n   discussed in [RFC4928]) assume\
    \ that the payload is IPv4 or IPv6,\n   respectively and, as a result, perform\
    \ ECMP load balancing based on\n   (presumed) information present in IP/TCP/UDP\
    \ payload headers or in a\n   combination of MPLS label stack and (presumed) IP/TCP/UDP\
    \ payload\n   headers in the packet.\n   For SFC, ECMP may or may not be desirable.\
    \  To prevent ECMP when it\n   is not desired, the NSH Base Header was carefully\
    \ constructed so that\n   the NSH could not look like IPv4 or IPv6 based on its\
    \ first nibble.\n   See Section 2.2 of [RFC8300] for further details.  Accordingly,\
    \ the\n   default behavior for MPLS-encapsulated SFC is to not use ECMP other\n\
    \   than by using entropy derived from the MPLS label stack.  This\n   results\
    \ in all packets going to the same SF taking the same path\n   regardless of the\
    \ use of ECMP in the network.\n   If ECMP is desired when SFC is used with an\
    \ MPLS transport network,\n   there are two possible options: entropy labels [RFC6790]\
    \ and\n   flow-aware transport [RFC6391] labels.  A recommendation regarding\n\
    \   choosing between these options, and their proper placement in the\n   label\
    \ stack, is left for future study.\n"

  contents:
  - "4.  Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM) Considerations\n   OAM\
    \ at the SFC layer is handled by SFC-defined mechanisms [RFC8300].\n   However,\
    \ OAM may be required at the MPLS transport layer.  If so,\n   then standard MPLS-layer\
    \ OAM mechanisms such as the GAL [RFC5586] may\n   be used at the transport label\
    \ layer.\n"

    \ SFC packets using\n   the NSH over an MPLS transport network.  It follows well-established\n\

    \ new protocol elements or allocate any new code points, and it is\n   no more\
    \ or less secure than carrying any other protocol over MPLS.\n   To the MPLS network,\
    \ the NSH and its contents are simply an opaque\n   payload.\n   In addition,\
    \ the security considerations in [RFC8595] also apply to\n   this document.\n"
