Abstract This document specifies the algorithms, algorithm parameters, asymmetric key formats, asymmetric key sizes, and signature formats used in BGPsec (Border Gateway Protocol Security).
This document updates RFC 7935 (
"The Profile for Algorithms and Key Sizes for Use in the Resource Public Key Infrastructure") and obsoletes RFC 8208
("BGPsec Algorithms, Key Formats, and Signature Formats") by adding Documentation and Experimentation Algorithm IDs, correcting the range of unassigned algorithms IDs to fill the complete range, and restructuring the document for better reading.
This document also includes example BGPsec UPDATE messages as well as the private keys used to generate the messages and the certificates necessary to validate those signatures.
This document specifies the following:  the digital signature algorithm and parameters,  the hash algorithm and parameters,  the algorithm identifier assignment and classification,  the public and private key formats, and  the signature formats used by Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI)
Certification Authorities (CAs) and BGPsec (Border Gateway Protocol Security)
CAs use these algorithms when processing requests for BGPsec Router Certificates [RFC8209].
Examples of when BGPsec routers use these algorithms include requesting BGPsec certificates [RFC8209], signing BGPsec UPDATE messages [RFC8205], and verifying signatures on BGPsec UPDATE messages [RFC8205].
This document updates [RFC7935] to add support for a) a different algorithm for BGPsec certificate requests, which are issued only by BGPsec speakers; b) a different Subject Public Key Info format for BGPsec certificates, which is needed for the specified BGPsec signature algorithm; and c) different signature formats for BGPsec signatures, which are needed for the specified BGPsec signature algorithm.
The BGPsec certificates are differentiated from other RPKI certificates by the use of the BGPsec Extended Key Usage as defined in [RFC8209].
BGPsec uses a different algorithm [RFC6090]
[DSS] from the rest of the RPKI to provide similar security with smaller keys, making the certificates smaller; these algorithms also result in smaller signatures, which make the PDUs smaller.
Appendix A (non normative) contains example
BGPsec UPDATE messages as well as the private keys used to generate the messages and the certificates necessary to validate the signatures.
The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14
when, and only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here.
This section describes the significant changes between [RFC8208] and this document.
Added Section 2.1 containing Algorithm ID types.
Also, the interpretation of these IDs is described.
Restructured Sections 2 and 3 to align with the corresponding algorithm suite identifier value.
Corrected the range for unassigned algorithm suite identifier values.
Added Documentation algorithm suite identifier values.
Added Experimentation algorithm suite identifier values.
Changed the next hop IP in Appendix A's IPv6 example to use a private usage IPv6 address.
The algorithms used to compute signatures on CA certificates, BGPsec Router Certificates, and Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs)
are as specified in Section 2 of [RFC7935].
This section addresses algorithms used by BGPsec [RFC8205] [DSS].
For example, these algorithms are used by BGPsec routers to sign and verify BGPsec UPDATE messages.
To identify which algorithm is used, the BGPsec UPDATE message contains the corresponding algorithm ID in each Signature Block of the BGPsec UPDATE message.
Algorithm ID Types Algorithms in BGPsec UPDATE messages are identified by the Algorithm Suite Identifier field (algorithm ID) within the Signature Block (see Section 3.2 of [RFC8205]).
This document specifies five types of Algorithm IDs:  Reserved Algorithm ID Reserved algorithm IDs are the values 0x00 (0) and 0xFF (255).
These IDs MUST NOT be used in a Signature Block, and if encountered, the router MUST treat BGPsec UPDATE messages as malformed [RFC4271].
Signature Algorithm ID Signature algorithms are defined in Section 2.2 of this document.
Processing of BGPsec UPDATE signing and validation using signature algorithms is described at length in Sections 4.2 and 5.2 of [RFC8205].
This type of Algorithm ID is free for future assignments and MUST NOT be used until an algorithm is officially assigned (see Section 7).
In case a router encounters an unassigned algorithm ID in one of the Signature Blocks of a BGPsec UPDATE message, the router SHOULD process the Signature Block as an unsupported algorithm as specified in Section 5.2 of [RFC8205].
Experimentation Algorithm ID Experimentation algorithm IDs span from 0xF7
To allow experimentation to accurately describe deployment examples, the use of publicly assigned algorithm IDs is inappropriate, and a reserved block of Experimentation algorithm IDs is required.
This ensures that experimentation does not clash with assigned algorithm IDs in deployed networks and mitigates the risks to operational integrity of the network through inappropriate use of experimentation to perform literal configuration of routing elements on production systems.
A router that encounters an algorithm ID of this type outside of an experimental network SHOULD treat it the same as an unsupported algorithm as specified in Section 5.2 of [RFC8205].
Documentation Algorithm ID Documentation algorithm IDs span from 0xFB (251) to 0xFE (254).
To allow documentation to accurately describe deployment examples, the use of publicly assigned algorithm IDs is inappropriate, and a reserved block of Documentation algorithm IDs is required.
This ensures that documentation does not clash with assigned algorithm IDs in deployed networks and mitigates the risks to operational integrity of the network through inappropriate use of documentation to perform literal configuration of routing elements on production systems.
A router that encounters an algorithm ID of this type SHOULD treat it the same as an unsupported algorithm as specified in Section 5.2 of [RFC8205].
Algorithm ID 0x01 (1) (ECDSA P 256)
The signature algorithm used MUST be the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) with curve P 256 [RFC6090] [DSS].
The hash algorithm used MUST be SHA 256 [SHS].
Hash algorithms are not identified by themselves in certificates or BGPsec UPDATE messages.
They are represented by an OID that combines the hash algorithm with the digital signature algorithm as follows:
The ecdsa with SHA256 OID [RFC5480] MUST appear in the Public Key Cryptography Standards #10 (PKCS #10)
signatureAlgorithm field [RFC2986] or in the Certificate Request Message Format (CRMF) POPOSigningKey algorithm field [RFC4211]; where the OID is placed depends on the certificate request format generated.
In BGPsec UPDATE messages, the ECDSA with SHA 256 algorithm suite identifier value 0x01
(1) (see Section 7) is included in the Signature Block List's Algorithm Suite Identifier field.
The key formats used to compute signatures on CA certificates, BGPsec Router Certificates, and CRLs are as specified in Section 3 of [RFC7935].
This section addresses key formats found in the BGPsec Router Certificate requests and in BGPsec Router Certificates.
Asymmetric Key Pair for Algorithm ID 0x01 (1)
The ECDSA private keys used to compute signatures for certificate requests and BGPsec UPDATE messages MUST be associated with the P 256 elliptic curve domain parameters [RFC5480].
The public key pair MUST use the uncompressed form.
The Subject's public key is included in subjectPublicKeyInfo [RFC5280].
It has two sub fields: algorithm and subjectPublicKey.
The values for the structures and their sub structures follow:  algorithm (an AlgorithmIdentifier type):
ecPublicKey OID MUST be used in the algorithm field, as specified in Section 2.1.1 of [RFC5480].
The value for the associated parameters MUST be secp256r1, as specified in Section 2.1.1.1 of [RFC5480].
subjectPublicKey: ECPoint MUST be used to encode the certificate's subjectPublicKey field, as specified in Section 2.2 of [RFC5480].
Private Key Format Local policy determines private key format.
The structure for the certificate's and CRL's signature field MUST be as specified in Section 4 of [RFC7935]; this is the same format used by other RPKI certificates.
The structure for the certification request's and BGPsec UPDATE message's signature field MUST be as specified in Section 2.2.3 of [RFC3279].
It is anticipated that BGPsec will require the adoption of updated key sizes and a different set of signature and hash algorithms over time, in order to maintain an acceptable level of cryptographic security.
This profile should be updated to specify such future requirements, when appropriate.
The recommended procedures to implement such a transition of key sizes and algorithms are specified in [RFC6916].
The security considerations of [RFC3279], [RFC5480], [RFC6090], [RFC7935], and [RFC8209] apply to certificates.
The security considerations of [RFC3279], [RFC6090], [RFC7935], and [RFC8209] apply to certification requests.
The security considerations of [RFC3279], [RFC6090], and [RFC8205] apply to BGPsec UPDATE messages.
No new security considerations are introduced as a result of this specification.
The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) has created the "BGPsec Algorithm Suites" registry in the Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) group.
The one octet algorithm suite identifiers assigned by IANA identify the digest algorithm and signature algorithm used in the BGPsec Signature Block List's Algorithm Suite Identifier field.
Per [RFC8208], IANA registered a single algorithm suite identifier for the digest algorithm SHA 256 [SHS] and for the signature algorithm ECDSA on the P 256 curve [RFC6090] [DSS].
This identifier is still valid, and IANA has updated the registration to refer to this document.
IANA has modified the range of the "Unassigned" address space from "0x2 0xEF" to "0x02 0xF6":
The "BGPsec Algorithm Suites" registry in the RPKI group now contains the following values:
Assignments consist of the one octet algorithm suite identifier value and the associated digest algorithm name and signature algorithm name.
Topology and Experiment Description Topology: AS(64496)
Prefix Announcement: AS(64496), 192.0.2.0/24, 2001:
db8::/32 The signature algorithm used in this example is ECDSA P 256, using the algorithm suite identifier ID 0x01 (1) as specified in Section 7 of this document.
For this example, the ECDSA algorithm was provided with a static k to make the result deterministic.
The k used for all signature operations was taken from [RFC6979], Appendix A.2.5, "Signatures With SHA 256, message   'sample'".
Note: Even though the certificates below are expired, they are still useful within the constraint of this document.
