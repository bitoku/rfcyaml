  - "1.  Introduction\n   The advice to experts for registering sub-services of the
    service URN\n   with the 'sos' service type is provided in Section 4.2 of RFC
    5031\n   [RFC5031] as follows:\n      The 'sos' service type describes emergency
    services requiring an\n      immediate response, typically offered by various
    branches of the\n      government or other public institutions.  Additional sub-services\n
    \     can be added after expert review and must be of general public\n      interest
    and have a similar emergency nature.  The expert is\n      designated by the ECRIT
    working group, its successor, or, in their\n      absence, the IESG.  The expert
    review should only approve\n      emergency services that are offered widely and
    in different\n      countries, with approximately the same caller expectation
    in terms\n      of services rendered.  The 'sos' service is not meant to invoke\n
    \     general government, public information, counseling, or social\n      services.\n
    \  Some existing emergency services are, at least initially, offered in\n   only
    one country.  Examples are the \"Reporting spies\" emergency\n   service offered
    in South Korea and the \"GAULA (anti-kidnapping)\"\n   emergency service offered
    in Colombia according to [WIKIPEDIA].\n   Future emergency service might also
    initially be introduced in only\n   one country.\n   The advice to experts of
    sub-services of the service URN with the\n   'sos' service type provided in RFC
    5031 [RFC5031] prevents the\n   registration of a sub-service of the service URN
    with the 'sos'\n   service type for a service that, at the time of registration,
    is\n   offered in one country only.\n   This document updates the 2nd paragraph
    of Section 4.2 of RFC 5031\n   [RFC5031], in order to allow the registration of
    service URNs with\n   the 'sos' service type for emergency services that, at the
    time of\n   registration, are offered in one country only.\n"
