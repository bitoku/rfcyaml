  contents:
  - "1. Abstract\n   This document describes an extension to the SMTP service that\
    \ allows\n   an SMTP server and client to use transport-layer security to provide\n\
    \   private, authenticated communication over the Internet. This gives\n   SMTP\
    \ agents the ability to protect some or all of their\n   communications from eavesdroppers\
    \ and attackers.\n"
- title: 2. Introduction
  contents:
  - "2. Introduction\n   SMTP [RFC-821] servers and clients normally communicate in\
    \ the clear\n   over the Internet. In many cases, this communication goes through\
    \ one\n   or more router that is not controlled or trusted by either entity.\n\
    \   Such an untrusted router might allow a third party to monitor or\n   alter\
    \ the communications between the server and client.\n   Further, there is often\
    \ a desire for two SMTP agents to be able to\n   authenticate each others' identities.\
    \ For example, a secure SMTP\n   server might only allow communications from other\
    \ SMTP agents it\n   knows, or it might act differently for messages received\
    \ from an\n   agent it knows than from one it doesn't know.\n   TLS [TLS], more\
    \ commonly known as SSL, is a popular mechanism for\n   enhancing TCP communications\
    \ with privacy and authentication. TLS is\n   in wide use with the HTTP protocol,\
    \ and is also being used for adding\n   security to many other common protocols\
    \ that run over TCP.\n"

- title: 3. STARTTLS Extension
  contents:
  - "3. STARTTLS Extension\n   The STARTTLS extension to SMTP is laid out as follows:\n\
    \   (1) the name of the SMTP service defined here is STARTTLS;\n   (2) the EHLO\
    \ keyword value associated with the extension is STARTTLS;\n   (3) the STARTTLS\
    \ keyword has no parameters;\n   (4) a new SMTP verb, \"STARTTLS\", is defined;\n\
    \   (5) no additional parameters are added to any SMTP command.\n"
- title: 4. The STARTTLS Keyword
  contents:
  - "4. The STARTTLS Keyword\n   The STARTTLS keyword is used to tell the SMTP client\
    \ that the SMTP\n   server allows use of TLS. It takes no parameters.\n"
- title: 5. The STARTTLS Command
  contents:
  - "5. The STARTTLS Command\n   The format for the STARTTLS command is:\n   STARTTLS\n\
    \   with no parameters.\n   After the client gives the STARTTLS command, the server\
    \ responds with\n   one of the following reply codes:\n   220 Ready to start TLS\n\
    \   501 Syntax error (no parameters allowed)\n   454 TLS not available due to\
    \ temporary reason\n   A publicly-referenced SMTP server MUST NOT require use\
    \ of the\n   STARTTLS extension in order to deliver mail locally. This rule\n\
    \   prevents the STARTTLS extension from damaging the interoperability of\n  \
    \ the Internet's SMTP infrastructure. A publicly-referenced SMTP server\n   is\
    \ an SMTP server which runs on port 25 of an Internet host listed in\n   the MX\
    \ record (or A record if an MX record is not present) for the\n   domain name\
    \ on the right hand side of an Internet mail address.\n   Any SMTP server may\
    \ refuse to accept messages for relay based on\n   authentication supplied during\
    \ the TLS negotiation. An SMTP server\n   that is not publicly referenced may\
    \ refuse to accept any messages for\n   relay or local delivery based on authentication\
    \ supplied during the\n   TLS negotiation.\n   A SMTP server that is not publicly\
    \ referenced may choose to require\n   that the client perform a TLS negotiation\
    \ before accepting any\n   commands. In this case, the server SHOULD return the\
    \ reply code:\n   530 Must issue a STARTTLS command first\n   to every command\
    \ other than NOOP, EHLO, STARTTLS, or QUIT. If the\n   client and server are using\
    \ the ENHANCEDSTATUSCODES ESMTP extension\n   [RFC-2034], the status code to be\
    \ returned SHOULD be 5.7.0.\n   After receiving a 220 response to a STARTTLS command,\
    \ the client\n   SHOULD start the TLS negotiation before giving any other SMTP\n\
    \   commands.\n   If the SMTP client is using pipelining as defined in RFC 1854,\
    \ the\n   STARTTLS command must be the last command in a group.\n"
- title: 5.1 Processing After the STARTTLS Command
  contents:
  - "5.1 Processing After the STARTTLS Command\n   After the TLS handshake has been\
    \ completed, both parties MUST\n   immediately decide whether or not to continue\
    \ based on the\n   authentication and privacy achieved. The SMTP client and server\
    \ may\n   decide to move ahead even if the TLS negotiation ended with no\n   authentication\
    \ and/or no privacy because most SMTP services are\n   performed with no authentication\
    \ and no privacy, but some SMTP\n   clients or servers may want to continue only\
    \ if a particular level of\n   authentication and/or privacy was achieved.\n \
    \  If the SMTP client decides that the level of authentication or\n   privacy\
    \ is not high enough for it to continue, it SHOULD issue an\n   SMTP QUIT command\
    \ immediately after the TLS negotiation is complete.\n   If the SMTP server decides\
    \ that the level of authentication or\n   privacy is not high enough for it to\
    \ continue, it SHOULD reply to\n   every SMTP command from the client (other than\
    \ a QUIT command) with\n   the 554 reply code (with a possible text string such\
    \ as \"Command\n   refused due to lack of security\").\n   The decision of whether\
    \ or not to believe the authenticity of the\n   other party in a TLS negotiation\
    \ is a local matter. However, some\n   general rules for the decisions are:\n\
    \    - A SMTP client would probably only want to authenticate an SMTP\n      server\
    \ whose server certificate has a domain name that is the\n      domain name that\
    \ the client thought it was connecting to.\n    - A publicly-referenced  SMTP\
    \ server would probably want to accept\n      any certificate from an SMTP client,\
    \ and would possibly want to\n      put distinguishing information about the certificate\
    \ in the\n      Received header of messages that were relayed or submitted from\n\
    \      the client.\n"
- title: 5.2 Result of the STARTTLS Command
  contents:
  - "5.2 Result of the STARTTLS Command\n   Upon completion of the TLS handshake,\
    \ the SMTP protocol is reset to\n   the initial state (the state in SMTP after\
    \ a server issues a 220\n   service ready greeting). The server MUST discard any\
    \ knowledge\n   obtained from the client, such as the argument to the EHLO command,\n\
    \   which was not obtained from the TLS negotiation itself. The client\n   MUST\
    \ discard any knowledge obtained from the server, such as the list\n   of SMTP\
    \ service extensions, which was not obtained from the TLS\n   negotiation itself.\
    \ The client SHOULD send an EHLO command as the\n   first command after a successful\
    \ TLS negotiation.\n   The list of SMTP service extensions returned in response\
    \ to an EHLO\n   command received after the TLS handshake MAY be different than\
    \ the\n   list returned before the TLS handshake. For example, an SMTP server\n\
    \   might not want to advertise support for a particular SASL mechanism\n   [SASL]\
    \ unless a client has sent an appropriate client certificate\n   during a TLS\
    \ handshake.\n   Both the client and the server MUST know if there is a TLS session\n\
    \   active.  A client MUST NOT attempt to start a TLS session if a TLS\n   session\
    \ is already active. A server MUST NOT return the TLS extension\n   in response\
    \ to an EHLO command received after a TLS handshake has\n   completed.\n"
- title: 6. Usage Example
  contents:
  - "6. Usage Example\n   The following dialog illustrates how a client and server\
    \ can start a\n   TLS session:\n   S: <waits for connection on TCP port 25>\n\
    \   C: <opens connection>\n   S: 220 mail.imc.org SMTP service ready\n   C: EHLO\
    \ mail.ietf.org\n   S: 250-mail.imc.org offers a warm hug of welcome\n   S: 250\
    \ STARTTLS\n   C: STARTTLS\n   S: 220 Go ahead\n   C: <starts TLS negotiation>\n\
    \   C & S: <negotiate a TLS session>\n   C & S: <check result of negotiation>\n\
    \   C: <continues by sending an SMTP command>\n   . . .\n"
- title: 7. Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "7. Security Considerations\n   It should be noted that SMTP is not an end-to-end\
    \ mechanism. Thus, if\n   an SMTP client/server pair decide to add TLS privacy,\
    \ they are not\n   securing the transport from the originating mail user agent\
    \ to the\n   recipient.  Further, because delivery of a single piece of mail may\n\
    \   go between more than two SMTP servers, adding TLS privacy to one pair\n  \
    \ of servers does not mean that the entire SMTP chain has been made\n   private.\
    \ Further, just because an SMTP server can authenticate an\n   SMTP client, it\
    \ does not mean that the mail from the SMTP client was\n   authenticated by the\
    \ SMTP client when the client received it.\n   Both the STMP client and server\
    \ must check the result of the TLS\n   negotiation to see whether acceptable authentication\
    \ or privacy was\n   achieved. Ignoring this step completely invalidates using\
    \ TLS for\n   security.  The decision about whether acceptable authentication\
    \ or\n   privacy was achieved is made locally, is implementation-dependant,\n\
    \   and is beyond the scope of this document.\n   The SMTP client and server should\
    \ note carefully the result of the\n   TLS negotiation. If the negotiation results\
    \ in no privacy, or if it\n   results in privacy using algorithms or key lengths\
    \ that are deemed\n   not strong enough, or if the authentication is not good\
    \ enough for\n   either party, the client may choose to end the SMTP session with\
    \ an\n   immediate QUIT command, or the server may choose to not accept any\n\
    \   more SMTP commands.\n   A server announcing in an EHLO response that it uses\
    \ a particular TLS\n   protocol should not pose any security issues, since any\
    \ use of TLS\n   will be at least as secure as no use of TLS.\n   A man-in-the-middle\
    \ attack can be launched by deleting the \"250\n   STARTTLS\" response from the\
    \ server. This would cause the client not\n   to try to start a TLS session. An\
    \ SMTP client can protect against\n   this attack by recording the fact that a\
    \ particular SMTP server\n   offers TLS during one session and generating an alarm\
    \ if it does not\n   appear in the EHLO response for a later session. The lack\
    \ of TLS\n   during a session SHOULD NOT result in the bouncing of email, although\n\
    \   it could result in delayed processing.\n   Before the TLS handshake has begun,\
    \ any protocol interactions are\n   performed in the clear and may be modified\
    \ by an active attacker. For\n   this reason, clients and servers MUST discard\
    \ any knowledge obtained\n   prior to the start of the TLS handshake upon completion\
    \ of the TLS\n   handshake.\n   The STARTTLS extension is not suitable for authenticating\
    \ the author\n   of an email message unless every hop in the delivery chain, including\n\
    \   the submission to the first SMTP server, is authenticated. Another\n   proposal\
    \ [SMTP-AUTH] can be used to authenticate delivery and MIME\n   security multiparts\
    \ [MIME-SEC] can be used to authenticate the author\n   of an email message. In\
    \ addition, the [SMTP-AUTH] proposal offers\n   simpler and more flexible options\
    \ to authenticate an SMTP client and\n   the SASL EXTERNAL mechanism [SASL] MAY\
    \ be used in conjunction with\n   the STARTTLS command to provide an authorization\
    \ identity.\n"
