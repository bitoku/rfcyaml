    Introduction\n   A discussion of the standardization process and the RFC document\n\
    \   series is presented first, followed by an explanation of the terms.\n   Sections\
    \ 6.2 - 6.10 contain the lists of protocols in each stage of\n   standardization.\
    \  Finally are pointers to references and contacts for\n   further information.\n\
    \   This memo is intended to be issued approximately quarterly; please be\n  \
    \ sure the copy you are reading is current.  Current copies may be\n   obtained\
    \ from the Network Information Center (INTERNIC) or from the\n   Internet Assigned\
    \ Numbers Authority (IANA) (see the contact\n   information at the end of this\
    \ memo).  Do not use this edition after\n   16-Jun-97.\n   See Section 6.1 for\
    \ a description of recent changes.  In the official\n   lists in sections 6.2\
    \ - 6.10, an asterisk (*) next to a protocol\n   denotes that it is new to this\
    \ document or has been moved from one\n   protocol level to another, or differs\
    \ from the previous edition of\n   this document.\n1.  The Standardization Process\n\
    \   The Internet Architecture Board maintains this list of documents that\n  \
    \ define standards for the Internet protocol suite.  See RFC-1601 for\n   the\
    \ charter of the IAB and RFC-1160 for an explanation of the role\n   and organization\
    \ of the IAB and its subsidiary groups, the Internet\n   Engineering Task Force\
    \ (IETF) and the Internet Research Task Force\n   (IRTF).  Each of these groups\
    \ has a steering group called the IESG\n   and IRSG, respectively.  The IETF develops\
    \ these standards with the\n   goal of co-ordinating the evolution of the Internet\
    \ protocols; this\n   co-ordination has become quite important as the Internet\
    \ protocols\n   are increasingly in general commercial use.  The definitive\n\
    \   description of the Internet standards process is found in RFC-1602.\n   The\
    \ majority of Internet protocol development and standardization\n   activity takes\
    \ place in the working groups of the IETF.\n   Protocols which are to become standards\
    \ in the Internet go through a\n   series of states or maturity levels (proposed\
    \ standard, draft\n   standard, and standard) involving increasing amounts of\
    \ scrutiny and\n   testing.  When a protocol completes this process it is assigned\
    \ a STD\n   number (see RFC-1311).  At each step, the Internet Engineering\n \
    \  Steering Group (IESG) of the IETF must make a recommendation for\n   advancement\
    \ of the protocol.\n   To allow time for the Internet community to consider and\
    \ react to\n   standardization proposals, a minimum delay of 6 months before a\n\
    \   proposed standard can be advanced to a draft standard and 4 months\n   before\
    \ a draft standard can be promoted to standard.\n   It is general practice that\
    \ no proposed standard can be promoted to\n   draft standard without at least\
    \ two independent implementations (and\n   the recommendation of the IESG).  Promotion\
    \ from draft standard to\n   standard generally requires operational experience\
    \ and demonstrated\n   interoperability of two or more implementations (and the\n\
    \   recommendation of the IESG).\n   In cases where there is uncertainty as to\
    \ the proper decision\n   concerning a protocol a special review committee may\
    \ be appointed\n   consisting of experts from the IETF, IRTF and the IAB with\
    \ the\n   purpose of recommending an explicit action.\n   Advancement of a protocol\
    \ to proposed standard is an important step\n   since it marks a protocol as a\
    \ candidate for eventual standardization\n   (it puts the protocol \"on the standards\
    \ track\").  Advancement to\n   draft standard is a major step which warns the\
    \ community that, unless\n   major objections are raised or flaws are discovered,\
    \ the protocol is\n   likely to be advanced to standard in six months.\n   Some\
    \ protocols have been superseded by better ones or are otherwise\n   unused. \
    \ Such protocols are still documented in this memorandum with\n   the designation\
    \ \"historic\".\n   Because it is useful to document the results of early protocol\n\
    \   research and development work, some of the RFCs document protocols\n   which\
    \ are still in an experimental condition.  The protocols are\n   designated \"\
    experimental\" in this memorandum.  They appear in this\n   report as a convenience\
    \ to the community and not as evidence of their\n   standardization.\n   Other\
    \ protocols, such as those developed by other standards\n   organizations, or\
    \ by particular vendors, may be of interest or may be\n   recommended for use\
    \ in the Internet.  The specifications of such\n   protocols may be published\
    \ as RFCs for the convenience of the\n   Internet community.  These protocols\
    \ are labeled \"informational\" in\n   this memorandum.\n   In addition to the\
    \ working groups of the IETF, protocol development\n   and experimentation may\
    \ take place as a result of the work of the\n   research groups of the Internet\
    \ Research Task Force, or the work of\n   other individuals interested in Internet\
    \ protocol development.  The\n   the documentation of such experimental work in\
    \ the RFC series is\n   encouraged, but none of this work is considered to be\
    \ on the track\n   for standardization until the IESG has made a recommendation\
    \ to\n   advance the protocol to the proposed standard state.\n   A few protocols\
    \ have achieved widespread implementation without the\n   approval of the IESG.\
    \  For example, some vendor protocols have become\n   very important to the Internet\
    \ community even though they have not\n   been recommended by the IESG.  However,\
    \ the IAB strongly recommends\n   that the standards process be used in the evolution\
    \ of the protocol\n   suite to maximize interoperability (and to prevent incompatible\n\
    \   protocol requirements from arising).  The use of the terms\n   \"standard\"\
    , \"draft standard\", and \"proposed standard\" are reserved in\n   any RFC or\
    \ other publication of Internet protocols to only those\n   protocols which the\
    \ IESG has approved.\n   In addition to a state (like \"Proposed Standard\"),\
    \ a protocol is also\n   assigned a status, or requirement level, in this document.\
    \  The\n   possible requirement levels (\"Required\", \"Recommended\", \"Elective\"\
    ,\n   \"Limited Use\", and \"Not Recommended\") are defined in Section 4.2.\n\
    \   When a protocol is on the standards track, that is in the proposed\n   standard,\
    \ draft standard, or standard state (see Section 5), the\n   status shown in Section\
    \ 6 is the current status.\n   Few protocols are required to be implemented in\
    \ all systems; this is\n   because there is such a variety of possible systems,\
    \ for example,\n   gateways, routers, terminal servers, workstations, and multi-user\n\
    \   hosts.  The requirement level shown in this document is only a one\n   word\
    \ label, which may not be sufficient to characterize the\n   implementation requirements\
    \ for a protocol in all situations.  For\n   some protocols, this document contains\
    \ an additional status paragraph\n   (an applicability statement).  In addition,\
    \ more detailed status\n   information may be contained in separate requirements\
    \ documents (see\n   Section 3).\n2.  The Request for Comments Documents\n   The\
    \ documents called Request for Comments (or RFCs) are the working\n   notes of\
    \ the \"Network Working Group\", that is the Internet research\n   and development\
    \ community.  A document in this series may be on\n   essentially any topic related\
    \ to computer communication, and may be\n   anything from a meeting report to\
    \ the specification of a standard.\n   Notice:\n      All standards are published\
    \ as RFCs, but not all RFCs specify\n      standards.\n   Anyone can submit a\
    \ document for publication as an RFC.  Submissions\n   must be made via electronic\
    \ mail to the RFC Editor (see the contact\n   information at the end of this memo,\
    \ and see RFC 1543).\n   While RFCs are not refereed publications, they do receive\
    \ technical\n   review from the task forces, individual technical experts, or\
    \ the RFC\n   Editor, as appropriate.\n   The RFC series comprises a wide range\
    \ of documents, ranging from\n   informational documents of general interests\
    \ to specifications of\n   standard Internet protocols.  In cases where submission\
    \ is intended\n   to document a proposed standard, draft standard, or standard\n\
    \   protocol, the RFC Editor will publish the document only with the\n   approval\
    \ of the IESG.  For documents describing experimental work,\n   the RFC Editor\
    \ will notify the IESG before publication, allowing for\n   the possibility of\
    \ review by the relevant IETF working group or IRTF\n   research group and provide\
    \ those comments to the author.  See Section\n   5.1 for more detail.\n   Once\
    \ a document is assigned an RFC number and published, that RFC is\n   never revised\
    \ or re-issued with the same number.  There is never a\n   question of having\
    \ the most recent version of a particular RFC.\n   However, a protocol (such as\
    \ File Transfer Protocol (FTP)) may be\n   improved and re-documented many times\
    \ in several different RFCs.  It\n   is important to verify that you have the\
    \ most recent RFC on a\n   particular protocol.  This \"Internet Official Protocol\
    \ Standards\"\n   memo is the reference for determining the correct RFC for the\
    \ current\n   specification of each protocol.\n   The RFCs are available from\
    \ the INTERNIC, and a number of other\n   sites.  For more information about obtaining\
    \ RFCs, see Sections 7.4\n   and 7.5.\n3.  Other Reference Documents\n   There\
    \ are three other reference documents of interest in checking the\n   current\
    \ status of protocol specifications and standardization.  These\n   are the Assigned\
    \ Numbers, the Gateway Requirements, and the Host\n   Requirements.  Note that\
    \ these documents are revised and updated at\n   different times; in case of differences\
    \ between these documents, the\n   most recent must prevail.\n   Also, one should\
    \ be aware of the MIL-STD publications on IP, TCP,\n   Telnet, FTP, and SMTP.\
    \  These are described in Section 3.4.\n3.1.  Assigned Numbers\n   The \"Assigned\
    \ Numbers\" document lists the assigned values of the\n   parameters used in the\
    \ various protocols.  For example, IP protocol\n   codes, TCP port numbers, Telnet\
    \ Option Codes, ARP hardware types, and\n   Terminal Type names.  Assigned Numbers\
    \ was most recently issued as\n   RFC-1700.\n3.2.  Requirements for IP Version\
    \ 4 Routers\n   This document reviews the specifications that apply to gateways\
    \ and\n   supplies guidance and clarification for any ambiguities.\n   Requirements\
    \ for IP Version 4 Routers is RFC-1812.\n3.3.  Host Requirements\n   This pair\
    \ of documents reviews and updates the specifications that\n   apply to hosts,\
    \ and it supplies guidance and clarification for any\n   ambiguities.  Host Requirements\
    \ was issued as RFC-1122 and RFC-1123.\n3.4.  The MIL-STD Documents\n   The DoD\
    \ MIL-STD Internet specifications are out of date and have been\n   discontinued.\
    \  The DoD's Joint Technical Architecture (JTA) lists the\n   current set of IETF\
    \ STDs and RFCs that the DoD intends to use in all\n   new and upgraded Command,\
    \ Control, Communications, Computers, and\n   Intelligence (C4I) acquisitions.\
    \  A copy of the JTA can be obtained\n   from http://www-jta.itsi.disa.mil.\n\
    4.  Explanation of Terms\n   There are two independent categorization of protocols.\
    \  The first is\n   the \"maturity level\" or STATE of standardization, one of\
    \ \"standard\",\n   \"draft standard\", \"proposed standard\", \"experimental\"\
    ,\n   \"informational\" or \"historic\".  The second is the \"requirement level\"\
    \n   or STATUS of this protocol, one of \"required\", \"recommended\",\n   \"\
    elective\", \"limited use\", or \"not recommended\".\n   The status or requirement\
    \ level is difficult to portray in a one word\n   label.  These status labels\
    \ should be considered only as an\n   indication, and a further description, or\
    \ applicability statement,\n   should be consulted.\n   When a protocol is advanced\
    \ to proposed standard or draft standard,\n   it is labeled with a current status.\n\
    \   At any given time a protocol occupies a cell of the following matrix.\n  \
    \ Protocols are likely to be in cells in about the following\n   proportions (indicated\
    \ by the relative number of Xs).  A new protocol\n   is most likely to start in\
    \ the (proposed standard, elective) cell, or\n   the (experimental, limited use)\
    \ cell.\n                             S T A T U S\n                     Req  \

    \   What is a \"system\"?\n      Some protocols are particular to hosts and some\
    \ to gateways; a few\n      protocols are used in both.  The definitions of the\
    \ terms below\n      will refer to a \"system\" which is either a host or a gateway\
    \ (or\n      both).  It should be clear from the context of the particular\n \
    \     protocol which types of systems are intended.\n4.1.  Definitions of Protocol\
    \ State\n   Every protocol listed in this document is assigned to a \"maturity\n\
    \   level\" or STATE of standardization: \"standard\", \"draft standard\",\n \
    \  \"proposed standard\", \"experimental\", or \"historic\".\n   4.1.1.  Standard\
    \ Protocol\n      The IESG has established this as an official standard protocol\
    \ for\n      the Internet.  These protocols are assigned STD numbers (see RFC-\n\
    \      1311).  These are separated into two groups: (1) IP protocol and\n    \
    \  above, protocols that apply to the whole Internet; and (2)\n      network-specific\
    \ protocols, generally specifications of how to do\n      IP on particular types\
    \ of networks.\n   4.1.2.  Draft Standard Protocol\n      The IESG is actively\
    \ considering this protocol as a possible\n      Standard Protocol.  Substantial\
    \ and widespread testing and comment\n      are desired.  Comments and test results\
    \ should be submitted to the\n      IESG.  There is a possibility that changes\
    \ will be made in a Draft\n      Standard Protocol before it becomes a Standard\
    \ Protocol.\n   4.1.3.  Proposed Standard Protocol\n      These are protocol proposals\
    \ that may be considered by the IESG\n      for standardization in the future.\
    \  Implementation and testing by\n      several groups is desirable.  Revision\
    \ of the protocol\n      specification is likely.\n   4.1.4.  Experimental Protocol\n\
    \      A system should not implement an experimental protocol unless it\n    \
    \  is participating in the experiment and has coordinated its use of\n      the\
    \ protocol with the developer of the protocol.\n      Typically, experimental\
    \ protocols are those that are developed as\n      part of an ongoing research\
    \ project not related to an operational\n      service offering.  While they may\
    \ be proposed as a service\n      protocol at a later stage, and thus become proposed\
    \ standard,\n      draft standard, and then standard protocols, the designation\
    \ of a\n      protocol as experimental may sometimes be meant to suggest that\n\
    \      the protocol, although perhaps mature, is not intended for\n      operational\
    \ use.\n   4.1.5.  Informational Protocol\n      Protocols developed by other\
    \ standard organizations, or vendors,\n      or that are for other reasons outside\
    \ the purview of the IESG, may\n      be published as RFCs for the convenience\
    \ of the Internet community\n      as informational protocols.\n   4.1.6.  Historic\
    \ Protocol\n      These are protocols that are unlikely to ever become standards\
    \ in\n      the Internet either because they have been superseded by later\n \
    \     developments or due to lack of interest.\n4.2.  Definitions of Protocol\
    \ Status\n      This document lists a \"requirement level\" or STATUS for each\n\
    \      protocol.  The status is one of \"required\", \"recommended\",\n      \"\
    elective\", \"limited use\", or \"not recommended\".\n   4.2.1.  Required Protocol\n\
    \      A system must implement the required protocols.\n   4.2.2.  Recommended\
    \ Protocol\n      A system should implement the recommended protocols.\n   4.2.3.\
    \  Elective Protocol\n      A system may or may not implement an elective protocol.\
    \ The\n      general notion is that if you are going to do something like this,\n\
    \      you must do exactly this.  There may be several elective protocols\n  \
    \    in a general area, for example, there are several electronic mail\n     \

    \      These protocols are for use in limited circumstances.  This may be\n  \
    \    because of their experimental state, specialized nature, limited\n      functionality,\
    \ or historic state.\n   4.2.5.  Not Recommended Protocol\n      These protocols\
    \ are not recommended for general use.  This may be\n      because of their limited\

    5.  The Standards Track\n   This section discusses in more detail the procedures\
    \ used by the RFC\n   Editor and the IESG in making decisions about the labeling\
    \ and\n   publishing of protocols as standards.\n5.1.  The RFC Processing Decision\
    \ Table\n   Here is the current decision table for processing submissions by the\n\

    \ Diagram\n   There is a part of the STATUS and STATE categorization that is called\n\
    \   the standards track.  Actually, only the changes of state are\n   significant\
    \ to the progression along the standards track, though the\n   status assignments\
    \ may change as well.\n   The states illustrated by single line boxes are temporary\
    \ states,\n   those illustrated by double line boxes are long term states.  A\n\
    \   protocol will normally be expected to remain in a temporary state for\n  \
    \ several months (minimum six months for proposed standard, minimum\n   four months\
    \ for draft standard).  A protocol may be in a long term\n   state for many years.\n\
    \   A protocol may enter the standards track only on the recommendation\n   of\
    \ the IESG; and may move from one state to another along the track\n   only on\
    \ the recommendation of the IESG.  That is, it takes action by\n   the IESG to\
    \ either start a protocol on the track or to move it along.\n   Generally, as\
    \ the protocol enters the standards track a decision is\n   made as to the eventual\
    \ STATUS, requirement level or applicability\n   (elective, recommended, or required)\
    \ the protocol will have, although\n   a somewhat less stringent current status\
    \ may be assigned, and it then\n   is placed in the the proposed standard STATE\
    \ with that status.  So\n   the initial placement of a protocol is into state\
    \ 1.  At any time the\n   STATUS decision may be revisited.\n         |\n    \

    \                                         +===========+\n   The transition from\
    \ proposed standard (1) to draft standard (2) can\n   only be by action of the\
    \ IESG and only after the protocol has been\n   proposed standard (1) for at least\
    \ six months.\n   The transition from draft standard (2) to standard (3) can only\
    \ be by\n   action of the IESG and only after the protocol has been draft\n  \
    \ standard (2) for at least four months.\n   Occasionally, the decision may be\
    \ that the protocol is not ready for\n   standardization and will be assigned\
    \ to the experimental state (4).\n   This is off the standards track, and the\
    \ protocol may be resubmitted\n   to enter the standards track after further work.\
    \  There are other\n   paths into the experimental and historic states that do\
    \ not involve\n   IESG action.\n   Sometimes one protocol is replaced by another\
    \ and thus becomes\n   historic, or it may happen that a protocol on the standards\
    \ track is\n   in a sense overtaken by another protocol (or other events) and\n\
    \   becomes historic (state 5).\n6.  The Protocols\n   Subsection 6.1 lists recent\

    \ an asterisk at the end of a line indicates a change from the\nprevious edition\
    \ of this document.]\nApplicability Statements:\n   IGMP -- The Internet Architecture\
    \ Board intends to move towards\n   general adoption of IP multicasting, as a\
    \ more efficient solution\n   than broadcasting for many applications.  The host\
    \ interface has been\n   standardized in RFC-1112; however, multicast-routing\
    \ gateways are in\n   the experimental stage and are not widely available.  An\
    \ Internet\n   host should support all of RFC-1112, except for the IGMP protocol\n\
    \   itself which is optional; see RFC-1122 for more details.  Even\n   without\
    \ IGMP, implementation of RFC-1112 will provide an important\n   advance: IP-layer\
    \ access to local network multicast addressing.  It\n   is expected that IGMP\
    \ will become recommended for all hosts and\n   gateways at some future date.\n\
    \   SMI, MIB-II SNMP -- The Internet Architecture Board recommends that\n   all\
    \ IP and TCP implementations be network manageable.  At the current\n   time,\
    \ this implies implementation of the Internet MIB-II (RFC-1213),\n   and at least\
    \ the recommended management protocol SNMP (RFC-1157).\n   RIP -- The Routing\
    \ Information Protocol (RIP) is widely implemented\n   and used in the Internet.\
    \  However, both implementors and users\n   should be aware that RIP has some\
    \ serious technical limitations as a\n   routing protocol.  The IETF is currently\
    \ devpeloping several\n   candidates for a new standard \"open\" routing protocol\
    \ with better\n   properties than RIP.  The IAB urges the Internet community to\
    \ track\n   these developments, and to implement the new protocol when it is\n\
    \   standardized; improved Internet service will result for many users.\n   TP-TCP\
    \ -- As OSI protocols become more widely implemented and used,\n   there will\
    \ be an increasing need to support interoperation with the\n   TCP/IP protocols.\
    \  The Internet Engineering Task Force is formulating\n   strategies for interoperation.\
    \  RFC-1006 provides one interoperation\n   mode, in which TCP/IP is used to emulate\
    \ TP0 in order to support OSI\n   applications.  Hosts that wish to run OSI connection-oriented\n\
    \   applications in this mode should use the procedure described in RFC-\n   1006.\
    \  In the future, the IAB expects that a major portion of the\n   Internet will\
    \ support both TCP/IP and OSI (inter-)network protocols\n   in parallel, and it\
    \ will then be possible to run OSI applications\n   across the Internet using\
    \ full OSI protocol \"stacks\".\n6.3.  Network-Specific Standard Protocols\nAll\

    6.10.  Obsolete Protocols\nSome of the protocols listed in this memo are described\
    \ in RFCs that are\nobsoleted by newer RFCs.  \"Obsolete\" or \"obsoleted\" is\
    \ not an official\nstate or status of protocols.  This subsection is for information\
    \ only.\nWhile it may seem to be obviously wrong to have an obsoleted RFC in the\n\
    list of standards, there may be cases when an older standard is in the\nprocess\
    \ of being replaced.  This process may take a year or two.\nMany obsoleted protocols\
    \ are of little interest and are dropped from\nthis memo altogether.  Some obsoleted\
    \ protocols have received enough\nrecognition that it seems appropriate to list\
    \ them under their current\nstatus and with the following reference to their current\
    \ replacement.\nRFC            RFC   Status     Title                        \
