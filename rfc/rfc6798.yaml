      \  used is\n      Numeric formats S X:Y\n         where S indicates a two's
      complement signed representation, X\n         the number of bits prior to the
      decimal place, and Y the number\n         of bits after the decimal place.\n
      \        Hence, 8:8 represents an unsigned number in the range 0.0 to\n         255.996
      with a granularity of 0.0039.  S7:8 represents the\n         range -127.996
      to +127.996. 0:16 represents a proper binary\n         fraction with range as
      follows:\n         0.0 to 1 - 1/65536 = 0.9999847\n         however, note that
      use of flag values at the top of the numeric\n         range slightly reduces
      this upper limit.  For example, if the\n         16-bit values 0xfffe and 0xffff

      \     A Packet Delay Variation Metrics Block is identified by the\n      constant
      15.\n   Interval Metric flag (I): 2 bit\n      This field is used to indicate
      whether the Packet Delay Variation\n      metrics are Sampled, Interval, or
      Cumulative metrics [MONARCH],\n      that is, whether the reported values apply
      to the most recent\n      measurement interval duration between successive metrics
      reports\n      (I=10) (the Interval Duration), or they apply to the accumulation\n
      \     period characteristic of cumulative measurements (I=11) (the\n      Cumulative
      Duration), or they are a sampled instantaneous value\n      (I=01) (Sampled
      Value).  The value I=00 is reserved and MUST NOT\n      be used.  If the value
      I=00 is received, then the XR block MUST be\n      ignored by the receiver.\n
      \  Packet Delay Variation Metric Type (pdvtyp): 4 bits\n      Packet Delay Variation
      Metric Type is of type enumerated and is\n      interpreted as an unsigned,
      4-bit integer.  This field is used to\n      identify the Packet Delay Variation
      Metric Type used in this\n      report block, according to the following code:\n
      \        bits 014-011\n            0: MAPDV2, Clause 6.2.3.2 of [G.1020],\n

      field is reserved for future definition.  In the absence of\n      such a definition,
      the bits in this field MUST be set to zero and\n      ignored by the receiver.\n
      \  block length: 16 bits\n      The length of this report block is in 32-bit
      words, minus one.\n      For the Packet Delay Variation Metrics Block, the block
      length is\n      equal to 4.\n   SSRC of source: 32 bits\n      This field is
      as defined in Section 4.1 of [RFC3611].\n   Positive PDV Threshold/Peak: 16
      bits\n      This field is associated with the Positive PDV percentile and\n
      \     expressed in milliseconds with numeric format S11:4.  The term\n      \"Positive\"
      represents that the packets are arriving later than the\n      expected time.\n
      \     If the measured value is less than -2047.9375 (the value that\n      would
      be coded as 0x8001), the value 0x8000 SHOULD be reported to\n      indicate
      an over-range negative measurement.  If the measured\n      value is greater
      than +2047.8125 (the value that would be coded as\n      0x7FFD), the value
      0x7FFE SHOULD be reported to indicate an over-\n      range positive measurement.
      \ If the measurement is unavailable,\n      the value 0x7FFF MUST be reported.\n
      \  Positive PDV Percentile: 16 bits\n      This field indicates the percentages
      of packets in the RTP stream\n      for which individual packet delays were
      less than the Positive PDV\n      Threshold.  It is expressed in numeric format
      8:8 with values from\n      0 to 100th percentile.\n      If the measurement
      is unavailable, the value 0xFFFF MUST be\n      reported.\n   Negative PDV Threshold/Peak:
      16 bits\n      This field is associated with the Negative PDV percentile and\n
      \     expressed in milliseconds with numeric format S11:4.  The term\n      \"Negative\"
      represents that the packets are arriving earlier than\n      the expected time.\n
      \     If the measured value is more negative than -2047.9375 (the value\n      that
      would be coded as 0x8001), the value 0x8000 SHOULD be\n      reported to indicate

      than +2047.8125 (the value that\n      would be coded as 0x7FFD), the value
      0x7FFE SHOULD be reported to\n      indicate an over-range positive measurement.
      \ If the measurement\n      is unavailable, the value 0x7FFF MUST be reported.\n
      \  Negative PDV Percentile: 16 bits\n      This field indicates the percentages
      of packets in the RTP stream\n      for which individual packet delays were
      more than the Negative PDV\n      Threshold.  It is expressed in numeric format
      8:8 with values from\n      0 to 100th percentile.\n      If the measurement
      is unavailable, the value 0xFFFF MUST be\n      reported.\n      If the PDV
      Type indicated is 2-point PDV and the Positive and\n      Negative PDV percentiles
      are set to 100.0, then the Positive and\n      Negative Threshold/Peak PDV values
      are the peak values measured\n      during the reporting interval (which may
      be from the start of the\n      call for cumulative reports).  In this case,
      the difference\n      between the Positive and Negative Threshold/Peak values
      defines\n      the range of 2-point PDV.\n   Mean PDV: 16 bits\n      The mean
      PDV value of data packets is expressed in milliseconds\n      with Numeric format
      S11:4 format.\n      For MAPDV2, this value is generated according to Clause
      6.2.3.2 of\n      [G.1020].  For interval reports, the MAPDV2 value is reset
      at the\n      start of the interval.\n      For 2-point PDV, the value reported
      is the mean of per-packet\n      2-point PDV values.  This metric indicates
      the arrival time of the\n      first media packet of the session with respect
      to the mean of the\n      arrival times of every packet of the session.  A single
      value of\n      the metric (for a single session) may not be useful by itself,
      but\n      its average over a number of sessions may be useful in diagnosing\n
      \     media delay at session startup.  For example, this might occur if\n      media
      packets are often delayed behind signaling packets due to\n      head-of-line
      blocking.\n      If the measured value is more negative than -2047.9375 (the
      value\n      that would be coded as 0x8001), the value 0x8000 SHOULD be\n      reported
      to indicate an over-range negative measurement.  If the\n      measured value
      is more positive than +2047.8125 (the value that\n      would be coded as 0x7FFD),
      the value 0x7FFE SHOULD be reported to\n      indicate an over-range positive
      measurement.  If the measurement\n      is unavailable, the value 0x7FFF MUST
      be reported.\n   Reserved: 16 bits\n      These bits are reserved for future
      definition.  They MUST be set\n      to zero by the sender and ignored by the
      receiver.\n"

    - "3.3.  Guidance on Use of PDV Metrics\n   This subsection provides informative
      guidance on when it might be\n   appropriate to use each of the PDV metric types.\n
      \  MAPDV2 (Clause 6.2.3.2 of [G.1020]) is the envelope of instantaneous\n   (per-packet)
      delay when compared to the short-term moving average\n   delay.  This metric
      could be useful in determining residual\n   impairment when an RTP end system
      uses an adaptive de-jitter buffer\n   that tracks the average delay variation,
      provided that the averaging\n   behavior of the adaptive algorithm is similar
      to that of the MAPDV2\n   algorithm.\n   2-point PDV (Clause 6.2.4 of [Y.1540])
      reports absolute packet delay\n   variation with respect to a defined reference
      packet transfer delay.\n   Note that the reference packet is generally selected
      as the packet\n   with minimum delay based on the most common criterion (see
      Sections 1\n   and 5.1 of [RFC5481]).  In an RTP context, the two \"points\"
      are at\n   the sender (the synchronization source that applies RTP timestamps)\n
      \  and at the receiver.  The value of this metric for the packet with\n   index
      j is identical to the quantity D(i,j) defined in Section 6.4.1\n   of [RFC3550],
      and the packet index i should be set equal to the index\n   of the reference
      packet for the metric in practice.  The metric\n   includes the effect of the
      frequency offsets of clocks in both the\n   sender and receiver end systems,
      so it is useful mainly in networks\n   where synchronization is distributed.
      \ As well as measuring packet\n   delay variation in such networks, it may be
      used to ensure that\n   synchronization is effective, for example, where the
      network carries\n   ISDN data traffic over RTP [RFC4040].  The metric is likely
      to be\n   useful in networks that use fixed de-jitter buffering, because it
      may\n   be used to determine the length of the required de-jitter buffer, or\n
      \  to determine if network performance has deteriorated such that\n   existing
      de-jitter buffers are too small to accommodate the observed\n   delay variation.\n"

    - "3.4.  Examples of Use\n      (a) To report MAPDV2 [G.1020]:\n         Pos PDV
      Threshold = 50.0; Pos PDV Percentile = 95.3; Neg PDV\n         Threshold = 50.0
      (note this implies -50 ms); Neg PDV Percentile\n         = 98.4; PDV type =
      0 (MAPDV2)\n         causes average MAPDV2 to be reported in the Mean PDV field.\n
      \        Note that implementations either may fix the reported\n         percentile
      and calculate the associated PDV level or may fix a\n         threshold PDV
      level and calculate the associated percentile.\n         From a practical implementation
      perspective, it is simpler to\n         use the second of these approaches (except
      of course in the\n         extreme case of the 100th percentile).\n      (b)
      To report 2-point PDV [Y.1540]:\n         Pos PDV Threshold = 60 (note this
      implies +60 ms); Pos PDV\n         Percentile = 96.3; Neg PDV Threshold = 0;
      Neg PDV Percentile =\n         0; PDV type = 1 (2-point PDV)\n         causes
      2-point PDV to be reported in the Mean PDV field.\n         2-point PDV, according
      to [Y.1540] is the difference in delay\n         between the current packet
      and the referenced packet of the\n         stream.  If the sending and receiving
      clocks are not\n         synchronized, this metric includes the effect of relative\n
      \        timing drift.\n"

      be called \"RTCP XR PDV block\n   - PDV type\" as a sub-registry of the \"RTP
      Control Protocol Extended\n   Reports (RTCP XR) Block Type Registry\".  Policies
      for this new\n   registry are as follows:\n   o  The information required to
      support an assignment is an\n      unambiguous definition of the new metric,
      covering the base\n      measurements and how they are processed to generate
      the reported\n      metric.  This should include the units of measurement, how
      values\n      of the metric are reported in the three 16-bit fields \"Pos PDV\n
      \     Threshold/Peak\", \"Neg PDV Threshold/Peak\", and \"Mean PDV\" within\n
      \     the report block, and how the metric uses the two 16-bit fields\n      \"Pos
      PDV Percentile\" and \"Neg PDV Percentile\".\n   o  The review process for the
      registry is \"Specification Required\" as\n      described in Section 4.1 of
      [RFC5226].\n   o  Entries in the registry are unsigned 4-bit integers.  The
      valid\n      range is 0 to 15 corresponding to the 4-bit field \"pdvtyp\" in
      the\n      block.  Values are to be recorded in decimal.\n   o  Initial assignments
      are as follows:\n      *  0: MAPDV2, Clause 6.2.3.2 of [G.1020],\n      *  1:
      2-point PDV, Clause 6.2.4 of [Y.1540],\n      *  2-15: Reserved for future use.\n"
