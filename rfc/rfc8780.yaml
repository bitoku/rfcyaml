  - "1.  Introduction\n   [RFC5440] specifies the Path Computation Element Communication\n
    \  Protocol (PCEP) for communications between a Path Computation Client\n   (PCC)
    and a PCE, or between two PCEs.  Such interactions include Path\n   Computation
    Requests (PCReqs) and Path Computation Replies (PCReps)\n   as well as notifications
    of specific states related to the use of a\n   PCE in the context of Multiprotocol
    Label Switching (MPLS) and\n   Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) Traffic Engineering (TE).\n
    \  A PCC is said to be any network component that makes such a request\n   and
    may be, for instance, an optical switching element within a\n   Wavelength Division
    Multiplexing (WDM) network.  The PCE, itself, can\n   be located anywhere within
    the network and may be within an optical\n   switching element, a Network Management
    System (NMS), or an\n   Operational Support System (OSS), or it may be an independent
    network\n   server.\n   This document provides the PCEP extensions for the support
    of Routing\n   and Wavelength Assignment (RWA) in Wavelength Switched Optical\n
    \  Networks (WSONs) based on the requirements specified in [RFC6163] and\n   [RFC7449].\n
    \  WSON refers to WDM-based optical networks in which switching is\n   performed
    selectively based on the wavelength of an optical signal.\n   The devices used
    in WSONs that are able to switch signals based on\n   signal wavelength are known
    as Lambda Switch Capable (LSC).  WSONs\n   can be transparent or translucent.
    \ A transparent optical network is\n   made up of optical devices that can switch
    but not convert from one\n   wavelength to another, all within the optical domain.
    \ On the other\n   hand, translucent networks include 3R regenerators (reamplification,\n
    \  reshaping, and retiming) that are sparsely placed.  The main function\n   of
    the 3R regenerators is to convert one optical wavelength to\n   another.\n   An
    LSC Label Switched Path (LSP) may span one or several transparent\n   segments,
    which are delimited by 3R regenerators typically with\n   electronic regenerator
    and optional wavelength conversion.  Each\n   transparent segment or path in WSON
    is referred to as an optical\n   path.  An optical path may span multiple fiber
    links, and the path\n   should be assigned the same wavelength for each link.
    \ In a case, the\n   optical path is said to satisfy the wavelength-continuity
    constraint.\n   Figure 1 illustrates the relationship between an LSC LSP and\n
    \  transparent segments (optical paths).\n   |   |I1     |     |       |     |
    \     |     |       I2|     |\n   |   |o------|     |-------[(3R) ]------|     |--------o|
    \    |\n       (X  LSC)     (LSC  LSC)    (LSC  LSC)     (LSC  X)\n         Transparent
    Segment         Transparent Segment\n                              LSC LSP\n       Figure
    1: Illustration of an LSC LSP and Transparent Segments\n   Note that two transparent
    segments within a WSON LSP do not need to\n   operate on the same wavelength (due
    to wavelength conversion\n   capabilities).  Two optical channels that share a
    common fiber link\n   cannot be assigned the same wavelength; otherwise, the two
    signals\n   would interfere with each other.  Note that advanced additional\n
    \  multiplexing techniques such as polarization-based multiplexing are\n   not
    addressed in this document since the physical-layer aspects are\n   not currently
    standardized.  Therefore, assigning the proper\n   wavelength on a path is an
    essential requirement in the optical path\n   computation process.\n   When a
    switching node has the ability to perform wavelength\n   conversion, the wavelength-continuity
    constraint can be relaxed, and\n   an LSP may use different wavelengths on different
    links along its\n   route from origin to destination.  It is, however, to be noted
    that\n   wavelength converters may be limited due to their relatively high\n   cost,
    while the number of WDM channels that can be supported in a\n   fiber is also
    limited.  As a WSON can be composed of network nodes\n   that cannot perform wavelength
    conversion, nodes with limited\n   wavelength conversion, and nodes with full
    wavelength conversion\n   abilities, wavelength assignment is an additional routing
    constraint\n   to be considered in all optical path computation.\n   For example
    (see Figure 1), within a translucent WSON, an LSC LSP may\n   be established between
    interfaces I1 and I2, spanning two transparent\n   segments (optical paths) where
    the wavelength continuity constraint\n   applies (i.e., the same unique wavelength
    must be assigned to the LSP\n   at each TE link of the segment).  If the LSC LSP
    induced a Forwarding\n   Adjacency / TE link, the switching capabilities of the
    TE link would\n   be (X X), where X refers to the switching capability of I1 and
    I2.\n   For example, X can be Packet Switch Capable (PSC), Time-Division\n   Multiplexing
    (TDM), etc.\n   This document aligns with [RFC8779] for generic properties such
    as\n   label, label set, and label assignment, noting that a wavelength is a\n
    \  type of label.  Wavelength restrictions and constraints are also\n   formulated
    in terms of labels per [RFC7579].\n   The optical modulation properties, which
    are also referred to as\n   signal compatibility, are already considered in the
    signaling in\n   [RFC7581] and [RFC7688].  In order to improve the signal quality
    and\n   limit some optical effects, several advanced modulation processing\n   capabilities
    are used by the mechanisms specified in this document.\n   These modulation capabilities
    not only contribute to optical signal\n   quality checks but also constrain the
    selection of sender and\n   receiver, as they should have matching signal processing\n
    \  capabilities.  This document includes signal compatibility\n   constraints
    as part of RWA path computation.  That is, the signal\n   processing capabilities
    (e.g., modulation and Forward Error\n   Correction (FEC)) indicated by means of
    the Optical Interface Class\n   (OIC) must be compatible between the sender and
    the receiver of the\n   optical path across all optical elements.\n   This document,
    however, does not address optical impairments as part\n   of RWA path computation.
    \ See [RFC6566] for the framework for optical\n   impairments.\n"
