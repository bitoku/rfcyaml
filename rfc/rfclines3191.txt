Abstract This memo describes a simple method of encoding Global Switched Telephone Network (GSTN) addresses (commonly called "telephone numbers") in the local part of Internet email addresses, along with an extension mechanism to allow encoding of additional standard attributes needed for email gateways to GSTN based services.
As with all Internet mail addresses, the left hand side (local part) of an address generated according to this specification, is not to be interpreted except by an MTA that handles messages for the domain given in the right hand side.
Since the very first e mail to GSTN services gateway appeared, a number of different methods to specify a GSTN address as an e mail address have been used by implementors.
Several objectives for this methods have been identified, like to enable an e mail user to access GSTN services from his/her e mail interface, to allow some kind of "GSTN over e mail service" transport (possibly reducing the costs of GSTN long distance transmissions) while using the existing e mail infrastructure.
This memo describes the MINIMAL addressing method to encode GSTN addresses into e mail addresses and the standard extension mechanism to allow definition of further standard elements.
The opposite problem, i.e., to allow a traditional numeric only GSTN device user to access the e mail transport service, is not discussed here.
The IANA registration templates which MUST be used to register any standard element defined according to this specification are given in the "IANA Considerations" chapter (section 7 of this document).
All implementations supporting this GSTN over e mail service MUST support as a minimum the specification described in this document.
The generic complex case of converting the entirety of GTSN addressing into e mail is out of scope in this minimal specification.
1.1 Terminology and Syntax conventions In this document the formal definitions are described using ABNF syntax, as defined into [7].
This memo also uses some of the "CORE DEFINITIONS" defined in "APPENDIX A CORE" of that document.
The exact meaning of the capitalized words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "
SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT",
"RECOMMENDED", "MAY", "OPTIONAL" is defined in reference [6].
In this document the following new terms are also defined: I pstn device: a device which has an Internet domain name
and it is able to communicate either directly or indirectly with the GSTN network;
the Internet domain name which identifies uniquely an I pstn device over the Internet; pstn email: the complete Internet e mail address structure which is used to transport a GSTN address over the Internet e mail service.
The minimal specification of a GSTN address within an e mail address is as follows:
; service selector MUST be handled as a case ; INSENSITIVE string by implementations.
Other specifications adopting the "pstn address" definition MUST define and register with IANA a unique case insensitive "service selector" element to identify the specific messaging service involved.
These specifications and registrations MUST also define which minimal "qualif type1" extensions, if any, MUST be supported for the specified messaging service.
Implementations confirming to this minimal requirements specification are allowed to ignore any other non minimal extensions address element which is present in the "pstn address".
However, conforming implementations MUST preserve all "qualif type1" address elements they receive.
As such, all "pstn address" extension elements MUST be defined in the "qualif type1" form at the time of registration with IANA.
2.1 Minimal "global phone" definition The purpose of global phone element is to represent standard E.164 numeric addresses [10] within a syntax for electronic mail addressing that is compliant with standard e mail specifications given in [1] and [2].
The minimal supported syntax for global phone element is as follows:
The use of other dialing schemes for GSTN numbers (like private numbering plans or local dialing conventions) is also allowed.
However, this does not preclude nor remove the mandatory requirement for support to the "global phone" syntax within the minimal GSTN address format.
The specification of alternate dialing schemas is out of scope for this minimal specification.
This document also permits the use of written sep elements in order to improve human readability of GSTN e mail addresses.
The written sep are elements which can be placed between dial elements such as digits etc.
Use of the written sep elements is allowed, but not recommended for transmission.
Any occurrences of written sep elements in a pstn mbox MUST be ignored by all conformant implementations.
The minimal "pstn address" examples
Some examples of minimal pstn address are: VOICE  3940226338 FAX  12027653000/T33S 6377
Note: these examples are given as illustrations only; they do not necessarily represent valid pstn addresses.
The e mail address of the I pstn device: mta
"I pstn device" has, among its characteristics, a unique Internet domain name which identifies it on the Internet.
For purposes of this document we will call this "mta I pstn" mta
For "domain" strings used in SMTP transmissions, the string MUST conform to the requirements of that standards <domain> specifications [1], [3].
For "domain" strings used in message content headers, the string MUST conform to the requirements of the relevant standards [2], [3].
Note: the use of "domain names" or "domain literals" is permitted in addresses in both the SMTP envelope and message header fields.
The complete structure used to transfer a minimal GSTN address over the Internet e mail transport system is called "pstn email".
This object is a an e mail address which conforms to [2] and [3]
"addr spec" syntax, with structure refinements which allows the GSTN number to be identified.
Implementations MUST accept the optional slashes but SHOULD NOT generate them.
Gateways are allowed to strip them off when converting to Internet mail addressing.
4.1 Multiple subaddresses There are some instances in GSTN applications where multiple subaddresses are used.
On the other hand in e mail practice a separate and unique e mail address is always used for each recipient.
In the event a particular GSTN service requires multiple subaddresses (in any form defined by the standard specification for that GSTN service) that are associated with the same "pstn mbox", then the use of multiple "pstn email" elements is REQUIRED.
Implementors' note: The UA may accept multiple subaddress elements for the same global phone, but it MUST generate multiple "pstn mbox" elements when submitting the message to the MTA.

This proposal creates a minimal standard encoding for GSTN addresses within the global e mail transport system.
It also defines the standard extension mechanism to be used to introduce new elements for GSTN addresses.
The proposal is consistent with existing e mail standards.
Each specific GSTN service using this proposal MUST define and register with IANA its own "service selector" specification and MUST define and register the eventual other "qualif type1" elements needed for its specific application.
An example of such an application is contained in reference [13].
This document specifies a means by which GSTN addresses can be encoded into e mail addresses.
Since e mail routing is determined by Domain Name System (DNS) data, a successful attack to DNS could disseminate tampered information, which causes e mail messages to be diverted via some MTA or Gateway where the security of the software has been compromised.
There are several means by which an attacker might be able to deliver incorrect mail routing information to a client.
These include: (a) compromise of a DNS server, (b) generating a counterfeit response to a client's DNS query, (c)
returning incorrect "additional information" in response to an unrelated query.
Clients SHOULD ensure that mail routing is based only on authoritative answers.
Once DNS Security mechanisms [5] become more widely deployed, clients SHOULD employ those mechanisms to verify the authenticity and integrity of mail routing records.
As the service selector and qualif type1 elements values are extensible, they MUST be registered with IANA.
To register a service selector or a qualif type1 element, the registration form templates given in 7.1 and 7.2 MUST be used.
Any new registration MUST fulfill the "Specification Required" criteria, as defined in RFC 2434, section 2 [16]: "Specification Required Values and their meaning MUST be documented in an RFC or other permanent and readily available reference, in sufficient detail so that interoperability between independent implementations is possible."
IANA MUST NOT accept registrations which are not supplemented by a Specification as defined above and which are not fully specified according to the template forms given in 7.1 and 7.2.
In case of need for further consultation about accepting a new registration, IANA SHOULD refer to the Application Area Director to be directed to the appropriate "expert" individual or IETF Working Group.
After successful registration, IANA should publish the registered new element in the appropriate on line IANA WEB site, and include it into the updates of the "Assigned Numbers" RFC series.
This section (including 7.1 and 7.2) updates the ones contained in [15].

foo ("foo" is a fictional new service selector used in this template as an example, it is to be replaced with the new value being registered.
Include a short description of the use of the new value here.
This MUST include reference to Standard Track RFCs and eventually to other Standard Bodies documents for the complete description; the use of the value must be defined completely enough for independent implementation).

7.2 IANA Registration form template for new values of GSTN address qualif type1 keyword and value
Registration of new values for the GSTN address qualif type1 element "bar" qualif type1 "keyword" name: bar qualif type1 "value" ABNF definition: abnf ("abnf" MUST define the ABNF form of the qualif type1 value.
The ABNF specification MUST be self contained, using as basic elements the tokens given in specification [4].
To avoid any duplication (when appropriate), it MUST also use any already registered non basic token from other qualif type1 elements, i.e., it MUST use the same non basic token name and then repeat its identical ABNF definition from basic tokens.
Description of Use: bar ("bar" is a fictional description for a new qualif type1 element used in this template as an example.
It is to be replaced by the real description of qualif type1 element being registered.
Include a short description of the use of the new qualif type1 here.
This MUST include reference to Standards Track RFCs and eventually to other Standard Bodies documents for the complete description; the use of the value MUST be defined completely enough for independent implementation.)
(If the new qualif type1 elements is meaningful only for a specific set of service element, you MUST specify here the list of allowed service element types.
If there is no restriction, then specify the keyword "none")
Any additional security considerations that may be introduced by use of the new service selector parameter should be defined here or in the reference

Changes from RFC 2303 specification
Although there are no technical or major changes from RFC 2303 specification, this section briefly describes where updates and clarifications were introduced:  considering the case that telephony systems do not conform any more to the "single/few" Public Operator paradigm, the old definition "PSTN Public Switched Telephone Network" was changed into the more adequate "GSTN Global Switched Telephone Network" one.
However, in order to remain consistent with the previous specification, the ABNF variables names were not changed.
it was made clear that "GSTN addresses" correspond, in common language, to "telephone numbers" and that the "global phone" is a representation of E.164 numeric addresses;  an explicit list of "new terms" with explanations was added to section 1.1;
the fact that any other specification adopting the "pstn address" definition MUST register with IANA the new "service selector" and "qualif type1" elements was made explicit throughout the document; the relevant mechanism to be used was added in section 7 "IANA considerations" (including the  IANA Registration form templates); this is also consistent with RFC 2846;  in section 2.1 the use and meaning of "written sep" was clarified;  in section 4., the quoting rules of the "pstn address" and their practical use was made explicit both in the definition of pstn email" and in the Implementors' note;  section 4.1 was updated to clarify how to generate "pstn email" when more than one subaddress is used;  the Author's Address was updated;  the References list was updated to include RFC 2846 and RFC 2434.
