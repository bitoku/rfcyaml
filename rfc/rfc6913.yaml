  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   Fax communications in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)\
    \ [RFC3261]\n   are handled in a \"voice first\" manner.  Indications that a user\n\
    \   desires to use a fax transport protocol, such as ITU-T T.38 [T38], to\n  \
    \ send a fax are not known when the initial INVITE message is sent.\n   The call\
    \ is set up as a voice call first, and then, only after it is\n   connected, does\
    \ a switchover to the T.38 [T38] protocol occur.  This\n   is problematic in that\
    \ fax calls can be routed inadvertently to SIP\n   user agents (UAs) that are\
    \ not fax capable.\n   To ensure that fax calls are routed to fax-capable SIP\
    \ UAs, an\n   implementation of caller preferences defined in RFC 3841 [RFC3841]\n\
    \   can be used.  Feature preferences are a part of RFC 3841 [RFC3841]\n   that\
    \ would allow UAs to express their preference for receiving fax\n   communications.\
    \  Subsequently, SIP servers take these preferences\n   into account to increase\
    \ the likelihood that fax calls are routed to\n   fax-capable SIP UAs.\n   This\
    \ document defines the \"fax\" media feature tag for use in the SIP\n   tree,\
    \ as per Section 12.1 of RFC 3840 [RFC3840].  This feature tag\n   will be applied\
    \ per RFC 3841 [RFC3841] as a feature preference for\n   fax-capable UAs.\n"

    \ 2119 [RFC2119].\n"
- title: 3.  Motivation
  contents:
  - "3.  Motivation\n   In the majority of circumstances, it is preferred that capabilities\n\
    \   be handled in the Session Description Protocol (SDP) portion of the\n   SIP\
    \ [RFC3261] communication.  However, fax is somewhat unique in that\n   the ultimate\
    \ intention of the call is not accurately signaled in the\n   initial SDP exchange.\
    \  Specifically, indications of T.38 [T38] or any\n   other fax transport protocol\
    \ in the call are not known when the call\n   is initiated by an INVITE message.\
    \  Fax calls are always considered\n   voice calls until after they are connected.\
    \  This results in the\n   possibility of fax calls being received by SIP UAs\
    \ that are not\n   capable of handling fax transmissions.\n   For example, Alice\
    \ wants to send a fax to Bob.  Bob has registered\n   two SIP UAs.  The first\
    \ SIP UA is not fax capable, but the second one\n   supports the T.38 [T38] fax\
    \ protocol.  Currently, SIP servers are\n   unable to know at the time that the\
    \ call starts that Alice prefers a\n   fax-capable SIP UA to handle her call.\
    \  Additionally, the SIP servers\n   are also not aware of which of Bob's SIP\
    \ UAs are fax capable.\n   To resolve this issue of calls not arriving at a UA\
    \ that supports\n   fax, this document defines a new media feature tag specific\
    \ to fax,\n   per RFC 3840 [RFC3840].  Caller preferences, as defined in RFC 3841\n\
    \   [RFC3841], can then be used for registering UAs that support fax and\n   for\
    \ routing fax calls to these UAs.  Thus, Alice can express up front\n   that she\
    \ prefers a T.38 [T38] fax-capable SIP UA for this call.  At\n   the same time,\
    \ Bob's SIP UAs have expressed their fax capabilities as\n   well during registration.\
    \  Now, when Alice places a fax call to Bob,\n   the call is appropriately routed\
    \ to Bob's fax-capable SIP UA.\n"
- title: 4.  Usage of the "sip.fax" Parameter
  contents:
  - "4.  Usage of the \"sip.fax\" Parameter\n   The \"sip.fax\" media feature tag\
    \ is a new string parameter, defined in\n   this document, that allows a call\
    \ to indicate a fax preference.  A\n   receiving UA includes the \"sip.fax\" media\
    \ feature tag in the Contact\n   header field of REGISTER messages to indicate\
    \ that it is fax capable,\n   and a SIP Registrar includes this tag in the Contact\
    \ header field of\n   its 200 OK response to confirm the registration of this\
    \ preference,\n   all as per RFC 3840 [RFC3840].\n   A calling UA SHOULD include\
    \ the \"sip.fax\" media feature tag in the\n   Accept-Contact header of an INVITE\
    \ request in order to express its\n   desire for a call to be routed to a fax-capable\
    \ UA.  Otherwise,\n   without this tag, fax call determination is not possible\
    \ until after\n   the call is connected.  If a calling UA includes the \"sip.fax\"\
    \ tag\n   and the SIP network elements that process the call (including the\n\
    \   called UAs) implement the procedures of RFC 3840 and RFC 3841, the\n   call\
    \ will be preferentially routed to UAs that have advertised their\n   support\
    \ for this feature (by including it in the Contact header of\n   their REGISTER\
    \ requests, as documented above).\n   It is possible for the calling UA to utilize\
    \ additional procedures\n   defined in RFC 3840 and RFC 3841 to express a requirement\
    \ (instead of\n   a preference) that its call be delivered to fax-capable UAs.\n\
    \   However, the calling UA SHOULD NOT require the \"sip.fax\" media type.\n \
    \  Doing so could result in call failure for a number of reasons, not\n   only\
    \ because there may not be any receiving UAs registered that have\n   advertised\
    \ their support for this feature, but also because one or\n   more SIP network\
    \ elements that process the call may not support the\n   processing defined in\
    \ RFC 3840 and RFC 3841.  A calling UA that\n   wishes to express this requirement\
    \ should be prepared to relax it to\n   a preference if it receives a failure\
    \ response indicating that the\n   requirement mechanism itself is not supported\
    \ by the called UAs,\n   their proxies, or other SIP network elements.\n   When\
    \ calls do connect through the use of \"sip.fax\" either as a\n   preference or\
    \ a requirement, UAs should follow standard fax\n   negotiation procedures documented\
    \ in ITU-T T.38 [T38] for T.38 fax\n   calls and ITU-T G.711 [G711] and ITU-T\
    \ V.152 [V152], Sections 6 and\n   6.1, for fax passthrough calls.  Subsequently,\
    \ the \"sip.fax\" feature\n   tag has two allowed values: \"t38\" and \"passthrough\"\
    .  The \"t38\" value\n   indicates that the impending call will utilize the ITU-T\
    \ T.38 [T38]\n   protocol for the fax transmission.  The \"passthrough\" value\
    \ indicates\n   that the ITU-T G.711 [G711] codec will be used to transport the\
    \ fax\n   call.\n"
