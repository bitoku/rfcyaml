- title: 2. Overview
  contents:
  - "2. Overview\n   The World Wide Web (WWW) is a network of information, accessible\
    \ via\n   a simple easy to use interface.  The information is often presented\n\
    \   in HyperText or multi-media.  The information is provided by servers\n   which\
    \ are located all around the world.  The usability of the web\n   depends largely\
    \ on the performance of these servers. WWW servers are\n   typically monitored\
    \ through log files.  This becomes a difficult task\n   when a single organization\
    \ is responsible for a number of servers.\n   Since many organizations currently\
    \ use the Internet Standard SNMP to\n   manage their network devices, it is desirable\
    \ to treat these WWW\n   servers as additional devices within this framework.\
    \ This will allow\n   a single Network Management Station (NMS) to automate the\
    \ management\n   of a number of WWW servers as well as the entire enterprise.\
    \ Defining\n   a standard for this purpose allows a single management application\
    \ to\n   manage a number of servers from a variety of vendors.  Additionally,\n\
    \   a formal definition of what has to be managed and how to manage it\n   tends\
    \ to lead to integrated and improved performance and fault\n   management.\n \
    \  Content providers are interested in the access statistics and\n   configuration\
    \ of their sites. The content provider may be the same or\n   a different organization\
    \ than the one that maintains the server as a\n   whole. It may be possible to\
    \ realize the new paradigm of \"Customer\n   Network Management\" to provide this\
    \ information to the content\n   provider. This means that there exists a distinct\
    \ organization\n   different than the network operations center that is also interested\n\
    \   in the management information from a device. Customer network\n   management\
    \ is desirable to allow each content provider on a server to\n   access information\
    \ about his own documents independent of the rest.\n   Various organizations may\
    \ be interested in SNMP manageable WWW\n   clients and proxies as well. At this\
    \ time, our focus is on WWW\n   servers. A natural extension to this work could\
    \ be a framework for\n   managing WWW Clients and general information retrieval\
    \ systems like\n   WWW proxies, NNTP, GOPHER, FTP and WAIS.  The focus of this\
    \ document\n   remains the management of WWW servers.\n"
- title: 3. Requirements
  contents:
  - "3. Requirements\n   WWW servers can be viewed from several perspectives when\
    \ assigning\n   management responsibilities.  For the sake of discussion, these\n\
    \   perspectives are named the Operational Model and the Service Model.\n   The\
    \ Operational Model views WWW servers as computers with hardware,\n   disk, OS\
    \ and web server software.  This model represents the actual\n   resources that\
    \ make up the machine so that it can be monitored from\n   the perspective of\
    \ resource utilization.  The Service Model views the\n   WWW server as a black\
    \ box that simply handles the responses to\n   requests from clients located on\
    \ the web.\n   The two models compliment each other while providing distinct\n\
    \   information about the server.  Members of the organization\n   responsible\
    \ for the WWW server, may be interested in one and/or both\n   of the management\
    \ models.  For this reason, the management\n   information should be scalable,\
    \ for one or both models to be\n   implemented independent of the other.\n   With\
    \ this in mind, the requirements for WWW server management can are\n   summarized\
    \ below by expanding upon those generated at the HTTP-MIB\n   BOF.\n"

    \ among processes.\n   These dependencies become critical when a particular process\

  - "4. Relationship to existing IETF efforts\n   In general, a WWW server is made\
    \ up of or depends upon the following\n   components:\n      -a general purpose\
    \ workstation running some operating system\n      -http server software to answers\
    \ requests from the network\n      -various support routines like CGI programs\
    \ or external\n       applications (like DBMS) used to access information\n  \
    \    -a document store on one or more storage devices\n   The health and performance\
    \ of each of the above components is of\n   interest when managing a WWW server.\n\
    \   There are a number of standards track MIB modules that are of\n   interest\
    \ to the above list of items.  This list includes MIB-II [2],\n   Host Resources\
    \ MIB [3], Network Service Monitoring MIB [4] and\n   Application MIB [5].\n \
    \  This creates an impressive list of attributes to be implemented.  A\n   definition\
    \ of various levels of management of a WWW server is desired\n   so that the implementor\
    \ may scale his implementation in chunks which\n   may include various components\
    \ of each section.  For instance, this\n   may allow customer network management\
    \ without requiring the other\n   groups being implemented.\n"

    \ as six groups; each specified as either\n   \"mandatory\" or \"optional\". \
    \ If ANY \"optional\" group of the MIB is\n   implemented, then ALL \"mandatory\"\
    \ groups of the MIB must also be\n   implemented.  This may cause implementation\

    \ Much of this information is useful for\n   managing various aspects of a WWW\

    \   mapping between running software and installed software is difficult\n   since\
    \ it is related by a foreign key (Product ID) which does not\n   appear to be\
    \ required to exist in either table [6]. There is no\n   provision to represent\

  contents:
  - "4.3. Network Services Monitoring MIB [4]\n   This MIB is one of three documents\
    \ produced by the MADMAN (Message\n   And Directory MANagement) Working group.\
    \  It defines a set of general\n   purpose attributes which would be appropriate\
    \ for a range of\n   applications that provide network services.  This definition\
    \ is from\n   the perspective of the service without considering the implementation\n\
    \   in terms of host computers or processes.  Attributes provide\n   statistics\
    \ and status on the in-bound and out-bound associations that\n   are currently\
    \ active, and which have been active.\n   This MIB is intended to be the minimum\
    \ set of attributes common\n   across a number of Network Service Applications.\
    \  Additional\n   attributes are to be defined as necessary to manage specific\
    \ network\n   service applications.  WWW servers clearly fall into the category\
    \ of\n   network service applications.  All attributes in this MIB are\n   relevant\
    \ to WWW servers.\n   The MIB consists of two tables:\n           -applTable \

    \   The applTable describes applications that provide network services\n   and\
    \ keeps statistics of the current number of active associations and\n   the total\
    \ number of associations since application initialization.\n   The assocTable\
    \ contains more detailed information about active\n   associations.\n   The other\
    \ two MIBs defined by MADMAN, MTA MIB [7] and DSA MIB [8],\n   are not relevant\
    \ to the management of WWW services.  They do,\n   however, demonstrate how to\

- title: 4.4. Application MIB [5]
  contents:
  - "4.4. Application MIB [5]\n   The Application MIB WG is defining two separate\
    \ MIBs: the sysApplMib\n   and the applMib.  The first defines attributes that\
    \ can be monitored\n   without instrumenting the applications.  The second will\
    \ define\n   additional attributes requiring application instrumentation.\n  \
    \ The sysApplMIB allows for the description of applications as a\n   collection\
    \ of executables, and files installed and executing on a\n   host computer. The\
    \ objects support configuration, fault and\n   performance management of some\
    \ of the basic attributes of application\n   software.\n   The groups defined\
    \ in the sysApplMIB are:\n           -System Application Installed Group     Mandatory\n\

    \       -sysApplElmtRunTable\n                   -sysApplElmtPastRunTable\n  \
    \ The sysApplInstalledTable captures what applications are installed on\n   a\
    \ particular host and the sysApplCfgElmtTable provides information\n   regarding\
    \ the executables and non executable files which collectively\n   compose the\
    \ application. The sysApplRunTable contains the application\n   instances which\
    \ are currently running and the sysApplPastRunTable\n   contains a history about\
    \ applications which have previously executed\n   on the host. The sysApplElmtRunTable\
    \ contains the process instances\n   which are currently running and sysApplElmtPastRunTable\
    \ contains a\n   history about processes which have previously executed on the\
    \ host.\n   It should be noted that two implementations of the same set of\n \
    \  network services may each define a different set of processes and\n   files\
    \ within this MIB.  Ultimately enough management information is\n   needed so\
    \ that these different implementations can at least be\n   managed similarly.\n\
    \   WWW servers fall into the general category of application software.\n   Therefore\
    \ the attributes of this MIB are applicable if the process\n   level detail is\
    \ requested to meet the Operational Model requirements.\n   The Application MIB\

- title: 6. Definition of additional attributes
  contents:
  - "6. Definition of additional attributes\n   The existing MIB attributes meet the\
    \ Operational Model Requirement\n   for tracking information specific to a host.\
    \  Specifically, MIB-II,\n   Host Resources and the Applications MIB address these\
    \ items. The\n   Network Services MIB addresses a portion of the service model\n\
    \   requirement for the decoupling of the information space from the\n   transport\
    \ mechanism.\n   Several sets of additional attributes are needed to meet the\n\
    \   remaining requirements. These additional attributes may be generally\n   applicable\
    \ to other network information retrieval services (like FTP,\n   NNTP, GOPHER\
    \ and WAIS) as well as client and proxy management.\n   Management of these services\
    \ is not the scope of this document.\n   These additional attributes can be classified\
    \ as:\n   1) Definition of relationship between the Network Services Monitoring\n\
    \      and Application MIBs.  This allows the functional organization of\n   \
    \   the server to be known.  It allows the management application to\n      understand\
    \ the effect of restarting specific processes on the\n      services provided.\
    \  This addresses the Operational Model\n      requirement to model dependencies\
    \ between applications.\n   2) Additions to generic Network Services Monitoring\
    \ MIB. A draft [9]\n      has already been circulated due to the work of a mailing\
    \ list and\n      a sample implementation.  These attributes list a summary at\
    \ the\n      service level of the configuration and the health of the server.\n\
    \      From this, performance metrics can be observed.  In addition, the\n   \
    \   health of the server in terms of data timeouts is known.  These\n      attributes\
    \ address the requirement for Operational Model tracking\n      of specific activity\
    \ and the requirement for Service Model\n      retrieval services.\n   3) Document\
    \ storage and access statistics are needed to address\n      service model requirements.\n\
    \   4) Additions to Application MIB are required to address server\n      configuration\
    \ requirements in the service model.\n   5) Error and fault management attributes\
    \ are required to address\n      requirements for tracking specific activity of\
    \ the web server.\n   6) Configuration and Control are items that may be able\
    \ to be defined\n      in a general way within the applications MIB.  If not,\
    \ a specific\n      definition would be required here.\n   Of the items listed\
    \ above, (1) is needed on a general basis.  The\n   others appear to the author\
    \ as WWW server specific unless the scope\n   of the work is opened to WWW clients\
    \ and proxies as well as other\n   services (like NNTP, FTP, GOPHER and WAIS).\n"
- title: 7. Usage Scenarios
  contents:
  - "7. Usage Scenarios\n   The example scenario will be a single host computer which\
    \ implements\n   WWW services using the \"virtual domain\" concept.  In this model,\
    \ a\n   single host performs as the WWW server for one or more addresses.\n  \
    \ For the purpose of example, we will specify that there are three\n   domains\
    \ being serviced from this host whose WWW servers are:\n           -www.a.com\n\
    \           -www.b.com\n           -www.c.com\n   Some implementations may implement\
    \ these services as one set of\n   processes that handle requests for each of\
    \ the addresses.  Others may\n   implement these services as a set of processes\
    \ for each address.\n   This means that the relationship defined between the Network\
    \ Services\n   Monitoring MIB and Application MIB components of the management\n\
    \   information may vary between different implementations of the same\n   configuration.\n\

  - "8. Conclusion\n   A number of currently defined attributes are useful for management\
    \ of\n   a WWW server. Specifically, MIB-II and Host Resources should be\n   considered\
    \ for monitoring the health of the machine in terms of host\n   and network configuration\
    \ and capacity.  The Network Services\n   Monitoring MIB and the Application MIBs\
    \ provide a general framework\n   to represent the components of the WWW server\
    \ from both a service and\n   implementation perspective.  The Network Services\
    \ Monitoring MIB\n   suggests that extensions are necessary to cover specific\
    \ network\n   application monitoring. A set of such attributes can be well defined\n\
    \   to provide status information of the WWW server.  The Application MIB\n  \
    \ suggests similar extensions.  Some of these attributes may be generic\n   to\
    \ all applications, and thus be implemented within the scope of the\n   applMib.\
    \ It is the opinion of this author that there will still\n   remain specific instrumentation\
    \ for WWW servers that can not, and\n   should not, be covered in the Network\
    \ Services Monitoring and\n   Application MIBs.\n   Since the Network Services\
    \ Monitoring MIB and the Applications MIB\n   represent orthogonal efforts of\
    \ management, it is desirable to define\n   the relationship between the two in\
    \ a standard way.  This definition\n   is probably more than a simple pointer\
    \ from one table to another.\n   Since it is outside the scope of either of those\
    \ efforts, it is this\n   author's opinion that that definition could and should\
    \ be addressed\n   within the scope of defining management of a specific application\
    \ (IE\n   WWW servers). This defintion although defined for a particular\n   application,\
    \ should be useful in a general way to describe the\n   relationship between the\
    \ Network Services Monitoring MIB and the\n   Applications MIB.\n   Additional\
    \ attributes are needed in order to meet all of the\n   requirements specified\
    \ in this document.  An IETF standard would\n   prevent independent developments\
    \ of this effort in many enterprise\n   MIBs.  It also allows management applications\
    \ to control servers from\n   multiple vendors.  It is likely that as the work\
    \ in this area\n   progresses, the management information will be useful for other\n\
    \   Network Information Retrieval services (like FTP, GOPHER, WAIS and\n   NNTP)\
    \ as well.\n   Finally, the Operational Model and Service Model Requirements lead\
    \ to\n   two main uses of the management information.  Design of the MIB\n   including\
    \ the usage of the existing MIBs should allow one or the\n   other or both of\
    \ these models to be implemented in a standard way.\n   This may be desirable\
    \ depending specifically on the audience of the\n   data, the cost of instrumentation\
    \ and the resources of the system.\n"
