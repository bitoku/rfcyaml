Abstract This document specifies a stable naming scheme for the nameservers that serve the zones IN ADDR.ARPA and IP6.ARPA in the DNS.
These zones contain data that facilitate reverse mapping (address to name).
The Domain Name System (DNS) is described in [RFC1034] and [RFC1035].
The DNS currently supports keyed data retrieval using three namespaces   domain names, IPv4 addresses, and IPv6 addresses.
Mapping of IPv4 addresses to names is accomplished using data published in the IN ADDR.ARPA zone.
For IPv6, the IP6.ARPA zone is used (see [RFC3596]).
The process of mapping an address to a name is generally known as a "reverse lookup", and the IN ADDR.ARPA and IP6.ARPA zones are said to support the "reverse DNS".
The secure and stable hosting of the IN ADDR.ARPA and IP6.ARPA zones is critical to the operation of the Internet, since many applications rely upon timely responses to reverse lookups to be able to operate normally.
At the time of this writing, the IN ADDR.ARPA zone is served by a subset of the DNS root servers, and IP6.ARPA by servers operated by APNIC, ARIN, ICANN, LACNIC, and the RIPE NCC (see Appendix A).
This document specifies a dedicated and stable set of nameserver names for each of the IN ADDR.ARPA and IP6.ARPA zones.
The naming scheme specified in this document allows IN ADDR.ARPA and IP6.ARPA to be delegated to two different sets of nameservers, to facilitate operational separation of the infrastructure used to serve each zone.
This separation might help ensure that an operational failure of IN ADDR.ARPA servers does not impact IPv6 reverse lookups as collateral damage, for example.
The choice of operators for individual nameservers is beyond the scope of this document and is an IANA function that falls under the scope of Section 4 of the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between the IETF and ICANN [RFC2860].
This document specifies the following naming scheme for servers that host the IN ADDR.ARPA zone:
A.IN ADDR SERVERS.ARPA B.IN ADDR SERVERS.ARPA C.IN
ADDR SERVERS.ARPA D.IN ADDR SERVERS.ARPA E.IN
ADDR SERVERS.ARPA F.IN ADDR SERVERS.ARPA ...
The IN ADDR SERVERS.ARPA zone has been delegated to the same set of servers as IN ADDR.ARPA.
IPv4 and IPv6 glue records for each of those servers has been added to the ARPA zone.
The IN ADDR SERVERS.ARPA and IN ADDR.ARPA zones are delegated to the same servers, since they are both dedicated for a single purpose and hence can reasonably share fate.
All servers in the set are named under the same domain to facilitate label compression.
Since glue for all servers exist in the ARPA zone, the use of a single domain does not present a practical single point of failure.
This document specifies the following nameserver set for the IP6.ARPA zone:
A.IP6 SERVERS.ARPA B.IP6 SERVERS.ARPA C.IP6 SERVERS.ARPA
The IP6 SERVERS.ARPA zone has been delegated to the same set of servers as IP6.ARPA.
IPv4 and IPv6 glue records for each of those servers has been added to the ARPA zone.
In its capacity as the body that provides technical guidance to ICANN for the administration of the ARPA top level domain as described in [RFC3172], the IAB has reviewed this proposal and supports it as an operational change that is in line with the respective roles of ICANN and the IAB.
IANA Considerations With due consideration to the approval of the IAB (see Section 4)
, the IANA has delegated: 1.
IN ADDR SERVERS.ARPA to the nameservers listed in Section 2; 2.
IP6 SERVERS.ARPA to the nameservers listed in Section 3.
Additionally, IANA has installed IPv4 and IPv6 glue records for the nameservers concerned in the ARPA zone.
The choice of operators for all nameservers concerned is beyond the scope of this document and is an IANA function that falls under the scope of Section 4 of the MoU between the IETF and ICANN
This document introduces no additional security risks for the Internet.
The NS RRSet for the IN ADDR.ARPA zone at the time of this writing is as follows: IN ADDR.ARPA.
The NS RRSet for the IP6.ARPA zone at the time of this writing is as follows: IP6.ARPA.
For completeness, the NS RRSet for the ARPA zone at the time of this writing is as follows: ARPA.
Appendix B.  Performance Characteristics B.1.
The choice of names for the respective
NS RRSets of the IN ADDR.ARPA and IP6.ARPA zones have a relatively minor impact on the delegation response sizes from their parent zones, given other anticipated contributors such as DNSSEC.
However, it is still considered good practice to use a naming scheme that is reasonably compressible: doing so for frequently queried zones such as these is likely to have at least measurable impact on aggregate DNS traffic in the Internet as a whole, and has potential transport benefits to clients whose queries will not result in secure replies.
The naming schemes described in Sections 2 and 3 are highly compressible.
That is, once a single nameserver name has been encoded in a DNS message, subsequent nameservers can be specified with substantially smaller encoding.
In the DNS, a complete encoding of an a label involves a one byte length field, plus a one byte per character encoding of the a label itself.
A domain name's encoding consists of one or more a labels, so encoded, plus a single terminating zero byte.
Where a terminating series of a labels has already been encoded as described above, subsequent terminating references to the same series can be made using a two byte pointer to that full encoding.
The non compressed representation of the nameserver A.IN ADDR  SERVERS.ARPA fills (1   1)
The non compressed representation of A.IP6 SERVERS.ARPA fills (1   1)
Subsequent nameservers under either domain are encoded with the initial label, plus two bytes for a pointer to the repeated domain elsewhere in the message, i.e., (1   1)   2   4 bytes.
The encoded size of the a labels in a twelve record
NS RRSet named according to Section 2 for IN ADDR.ARPA
The encoded size of the a labels in a six record
NS RRSet named according to Section 3 for IP6.ARPA is, hence, as follows:
A brief description of likely query patterns for an empty cache with the existing and new NS RRSets follows.
QNAME under IN ADDR.ARPA Consider the IN ADDR.ARPA
NS RRSet (described in Appendix A) and a QNAME that is delegated beneath the IN ADDR.ARPA zone: 1.
Query sent to root server that is also authoritative for IN ADDR.ARPA; response is a referral from the IN ADDR.ARPA zone.
In the case where the initial query is sent to the J root server: 1.
Query sent to J.ROOT SERVERS.NET (which is not authoritative for the IN ADDR.ARPA zone); response is a referral to an ARPA server with additional section glue.
Query sent to an ARPA server (all of which are also authoritative in this case for IN ADDR.ARPA); response is a referral from the IN ADDR.ARPA zone.
Consider the same query with the IN ADDR.ARPA NS RRSet (described in Section 2): 1.
Query sent to a root server that is also authoritative for ARPA; response is a referral to an IN ADDR.ARPA server, with additional  section glue.
Query sent to an IN ADDR.ARPA server; response is a referral from the IN ADDR.ARPA zone.
In the case where the first query is sent to the J root server: 1.
Query sent to J.ROOT SERVERS.NET (which is not authoritative for ARPA); response is a referral to an ARPA server, with additional  section glue.
Query sent to an ARPA server; response is a referral to an IN ADDR.ARPA server, with additional section glue.
Query sent to an IN ADDR.ARPA server; response is a referral from the IN ADDR.ARPA zone.
QNAME under IP6.ARPA Consider the IP6.ARPA NS RRSet (described in Appendix A) and a QNAME that is delegated beneath the IP6.ARPA zone: 1.
Query sent to root server that is also authoritative for ARPA; response is a referral from the ARPA zone to an IP6.ARPA server with no additional section glue.
A recursive lookup for one of the nameservers specified in the referral must now be performed in order to obtain an address for an IP6.ARPA server.
In all cases, three queries are required.
Successive recursive lookups may be performed in the event that a server is unresponsive.
