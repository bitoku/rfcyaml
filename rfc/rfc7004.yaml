  contents:
  - "1.1.  Summary Statistics Metrics\n   This document defines three new block types\
    \ to augment those defined\n   in [RFC3611] for use in a range of RTP applications:\n\
    \   o  Burst/Gap Loss Summary Statistics Block\n   o  Burst/Gap Discard Summary\
    \ Statistics Block\n   o  Frame Impairment Statistics Summary Block\n   The first\
    \ two block types support the reporting of burst/gap loss and\n   burst/gap discard\
    \ summary statistics including packet loss/discard\n   proportion, mean, and variance\
    \ and belong to the class of transport-\n   related end-system metrics defined\
    \ in [RFC6792].  These two blocks\n   are intended to be used in conjunction with\
    \ information from the\n   Burst/Gap Loss Metrics Block [RFC6958] or Burst/Gap\
    \ Discard Metrics\n   Block [RFC7003], on which these two blocks therefore depend.\
    \  The\n   metrics in the Burst/Gap Loss Metrics Block and Burst/Gap Discard\n\
    \   Metrics Block are consistent with the definitions of \"burst\", \"gap\",\n\
    \   \"loss\", and \"discard\" in RTCP XR [RFC3611].\n   The third block supports\
    \ the reporting of detailed video statistics\n   for each frame type, including\
    \ the number of frames received, lost,\n   and discarded of each frame type in\
    \ the Group of Pictures (GOP) and\n   additional data allowing the calculation\
    \ of statistical parameters\n   (e.g., the proportion of each frame type impaired\
    \ by packet loss and\n   discard).  The metrics defined in this block belong to\
    \ the class of\n   application-level metrics defined in [RFC6792].\n"
- title: 1.2.  RTCP and RTCP Extended Reports
  contents:
  - "1.2.  RTCP and RTCP Extended Reports\n   The use of RTCP for reporting is defined\
    \ in [RFC3550].  [RFC3611]\n   defined an extensible structure for reporting using\
    \ an RTCP Extended\n   Report (XR).  This document defines a new Extended Report\
    \ block for\n   use with [RFC3550] and [RFC3611].\n"
- title: 1.3.  Performance Metrics Framework
  contents:
  - "1.3.  Performance Metrics Framework\n   The RTP Monitoring Framework [RFC6792]\
    \ provides guidelines for\n   reporting block format using RTCP XR.  Metrics described\
    \ in this\n   document are in accordance with the guidelines in [RFC6792].\n"
- title: 1.4.  Applicability
  contents:
  - "1.4.  Applicability\n   These metrics are applicable to a wide range of RTP applications\
    \ and\n   reflect transient IP problems that affect user experience.  They can\n\
    \   be used to form an accurate assessment of users' quality of\n   experience\
    \ and influence sender strategies to mitigate the problem.\n"
- title: 2.  Terminology
  contents:
  - "2.  Terminology\n   The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\"\
    , \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and\
    \ \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC\
    \ 2119 [RFC2119].\n   In addition, the following term is defined:\n   Frame Type\n\
    \      In many cases, a video frame is compressed using different\n      algorithms.\
    \  Frame type is used to identify different algorithms\n      for video frames.\
    \  Two frame types used in the different video\n      algorithms are the Key frame\
    \ and Derived frames.  The Key frame is\n      independently coded without prediction\
    \ from other pictures and\n      used as a reference frame for predicting other\
    \ pictures.  Derived\n      frames are predicatively coded and derived from a\
    \ Key frame using\n      a prediction algorithm.  If there is no video image compression,\n\
    \      all frames are Key frames.\n"

    \ 32 bits\n      As defined in Section 4.1 of RFC 3611 [RFC3611].\n   Burst Loss\

    \ Block\n   Block Type (BT): 8 bits\n      A Frame Impairment Statistics Summary\
    \ Block is identified by the\n      constant 19.\n   Frame type indicator (T):\
    \ 1 bit\n      This field is used to indicate the frame type to be reported. \
    \ The\n      bit is set to 0 if the full_lost_frames, partial_lost_frames,\n \
    \     dup_frames, and discarded_frames fields contain Key frame\n      (reference\
    \ frame) counts or 1 if they contain Derived frame\n      counts.  Note that if\
    \ both the Key frame and Derivation frame\n      report are sent, they should\
    \ be sent in the same RTCP compound\n      packet using two Frame Impairment Statistics\
    \ Summary Blocks.\n   Reserved: 7 bits\n      This field is reserved for future\
    \ definition.  In the absence of\n      such a definition, the bits in this field\
    \ MUST be set to zero and\n      ignored by the receiver (see [RFC6709], Section\
    \ 4.2).\n   Block Length: 16 bits\n      The constant 6, in accordance with the\
    \ definition of this field in\n      Section 3 of RFC 3611 [RFC3611].\n   SSRC\
    \ of Source: 32 bits\n      As defined in Section 4.1 of RFC 3611 [RFC3611].\n\

    \ sequence number\n      interval.\n   Number of full lost frames (full_lost_frames):\
    \ 32 bits\n      A frame is either split across multiple packets or carried in\
    \ only\n      one packet.  If the whole frame or all the packets of the frame\n\
    \      are lost, this frame is regarded as one full_lost_frame.  The\n      full_lost_frames\

    \ is equivalent to the number of full\n      lost frames in the above sequence\
    \ number interval.\n   Number of partial lost frames (partial_lost_frames): 32\
    \ bits\n      When a frame is split across multiple packets and some packets of\n\
    \      the frame are lost, this frame is regarded as one\n      partial_lost_frame.\
    \  The partial_lost_frames can be inferred from\n      packets that comprise the\
    \ frame.  The value of the\n      partial_lost_frames field is equivalent to the\
    \ number of partial\n      lost frames in the above sequence number interval.\n"

    \       *  Metric Description: When a frame is split across multiple RTP\n   \
    \       packets and some RTP packets of the frame are lost, this frame\n     \
    \     is regarded as one partial_lost_frame.\n       *  Method of Measurement\
