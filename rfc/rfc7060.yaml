    \  Multipoint (MP2MP) LSPs are specified in [mLDP].  This set of\n   extensions

    Routers (LSRs) that are the endpoints of an\n   LDP session are considered to

    '
  - contents:
    - "2.1.  Selecting the Upstream LSR\n   In mLDP, a multipoint LSP (MP-LSP) has
      a unique identifier that is an\n   ordered pair of the form <root, opaque value>.
      \ The first element of\n   the ordered pair is the IP address of the MP-LSP's
      \"root node\".  The\n   second element of the ordered pair is an identifier
      that is unique in\n   the context of the root node.\n   If LSR D is setting
      up the MP-LSP <R, X>, D must determine the\n   \"upstream LSR\" for <R, X>.
      \ In [mLDP], the upstream LSR for <R, X>,\n   U, is defined to be the \"next
      hop\" on D's path to R, and \"next hop\"\n   is tacitly assumed to mean \"IGP
      next hop\".  It is thus assumed that\n   there is a direct LDP session between
      D and U.  In this\n   specification, we extend the notion of \"upstream LSR\"
      to cover the\n   following cases:\n      -  U is the \"BGP next hop\" on D's
      path to R, where U and D are not\n         necessarily IGP neighbors, and where
      there is a Targeted LDP\n         session between U and D.  In this case, we
      allow D to select U\n         as the \"upstream LSR\" for <R,X>.\n      -  If
      the \"next-hop interface\" on D's path to R is an RSVP Traffic\n         Engineering
      (RSVP-TE) P2P tunnel whose remote endpoint is U,\n         and if there is known
      to be an RSVP-TE P2P tunnel from U to D,\n         and if there is a Targeted
      LDP session between U and D, then we\n         allow D to select U as the \"upstream
      LSR\" for <R,X>.  This is\n         useful when D and U are part of a network
      area that is fully\n         meshed via RSVP-TE P2P tunnels.\n   The particular
      method used to select an \"upstream LSR\" is determined\n   by the Service Provider
      (SP) and must be made known a priori (i.e.,\n   by provisioning) to all the
      LSRs involved.\n   Other methods than the two specified above MAY be used; however,
      the\n   specification of other methods is outside the scope of this document.\n"
    title: 2.1.  Selecting the Upstream LSR
  - contents:
    - "2.2.  Sending Data from U to D\n   By using Targeted mLDP, we can construct
      an MP-LSP <R,X> containing\n   an LSR U, where U has one or more downstream
      LSR neighbors (D1, ...,\n   Dn) to which it is not directly connected.  In order
      for a data\n   packet to travel along this MP-LSP, U must have some way of\n
      \  transmitting the packet to D1, ..., Dn.  We will cover two methods of\n   transmission:\n
      \     -  Unicast Replication\n         In this method, U creates n copies of
      the packet and unicasts\n         each copy to exactly one of D1, ..., Dn.\n
      \     -  Multicast Tunneling\n         In this method, U becomes the root node
      of a multicast tunnel,\n         with D1, ..., Dn as leaf nodes.  When a packet
      traveling along\n         the MP-LSP <R,X> arrives at U, U transmits it through
      the\n         multicast tunnel, and as a result it arrives at D1, ..., Dn.\n
      \        When this method is used, it may be desirable to carry traffic\n         of
      multiple MP-LSPs through a single multicast tunnel.  We\n         specify procedures
      that allow for the proper demultiplexing of\n         the MP-LSPs at the leaf
      nodes of the multicast tunnel.  We do\n         not assume that all the leaf
      nodes of the tunnel are on all the\n         MP-LSPs traveling through the tunnel;
      thus, some of the tunnel\n         leaf nodes may need to discard some of the
      packets received\n         through the tunnel.  For example, suppose MP-LSP
      <R1,X1>\n         contains node U with downstream LSRs D1 and D2, while MP-LSP\n
      \        <R2,X2> contains node U with downstream LSRs D2 and D3.\n         Suppose
      also that there is a multicast tunnel with U as root\n         and with D1,
      D2, and D3 as leaf nodes.  U can aggregate both\n         MP-LSPs in this one
      tunnel.  However, D1 will have to discard\n         packets that are traveling
      on <R2,X1>, while D3 will have to\n         discard packets that are traveling
      on <R1,X2>.\n"

  title: 2.  Targeted mLDP and the Upstream LSR
- contents:
  - "3.  Applicability of Targeted mLDP\n   When LSR D is setting up MP-LSP <R,X>,
    it MUST NOT use Targeted mLDP\n   unless D implements a procedure that can select
    an LSR U that is a\n   Targeted mLDP peer of D as the \"upstream LSR\" for <R,X>.
    \ See Section\n   2.1.\n   Whether D uses Targeted mLDP when this condition holds
    is determined\n   by provisioning or by other methods that are outside the scope
    of\n   this specification.\n   When Targeted mLDP is used, the choice between
    unicast replication\n   and multicast tunneling is determined by provisioning
    or by other\n   methods that are outside the scope of this specification.  It
    is\n   presupposed that all nodes will have a priori knowledge of whether to\n
    \  use unicast replication or to use multicast tunneling.  If the\n   latter,
    it is presupposed that all nodes will have a priori knowledge\n   of the type
    of multicast tunneling to use.\n"
  title: 3.  Applicability of Targeted mLDP
- contents:
  - "4.  LDP Capabilities\n   Per [mLDP], any LSR that needs to set up an MP-LSP must
    support the\n   procedures of [LDP-CAP], and in particular must send and receive
    the\n   P2MP Capability and/or the MP2MP Capability.  This specification does\n
    \  not define any new capabilities; the advertisement of the P2MP and/or\n   MP2MP
    Capabilities on a Targeted LDP session means that the\n   advertising LSR is capable
    of following the procedures set forth in\n   this document.\n   Some of the procedures
    described in this document require the use of\n   upstream-assigned labels [LDP-UP].
    \ In order to use upstream-assigned\n   labels as part of Targeted mLDP, an LSR
    must advertise the LDP\n   Upstream-Assigned Label Capability [LDP-UP] on the
    Targeted LDP\n   session.\n"
  title: 4.  LDP Capabilities
- contents:
  - "5.  Targeted mLDP with Unicast Replication\n   When unicast replication is used,
    the mLDP procedures are exactly the\n   same as described in [mLDP], with the
    following exception.  If LSR D\n   is setting up MP-LSP <R,X>, its \"upstream
    LSR\" is selected according\n   to the procedures of Section 2.1, and is not necessarily
    the \"IGP\n   next hop\" on D's path to R.\n   Suppose that LSRs D1 and D2 are
    both setting up the P2MP MP-LSP\n   <R,X>, and that LSR U is the upstream LSR
    on each of their paths to\n   R.  D1 and D2 each binds a label to <R,X> and each
    uses a Label\n   Mapping message to inform U of the label binding.  Suppose D1
    has\n   assigned label L1 to <R,X> and D2 has assigned label L2 to <R,X>.\n   (Note
    that L1 and L2 could have the same value or different values;\n   D1 and D2 do
    not coordinate their label assignments.)  When U has a\n   packet to transmit
    on the MP-LSP <R,X>, it makes a copy of the\n   packet, pushes on label L1, and
    unicasts the resulting packet to D1.\n   It also makes a second copy of the packet,
    pushes on label L2, and\n   then unicasts the resulting packet to D2.\n   This
    procedure also works when the MP-LSP <R,X> is an MP2MP LSP.\n   Suppose that in
    addition to labels L1 and L2 described above, U has\n   assigned label L3 for
    <R,X> traffic received from D1 and label L4 for\n   <R,X> traffic received from
    D2.  When U processes a packet with label\n   L3 at the top of its label stack,
    it knows the packet is from D1, so\n   U sends a unicast copy of the packet to
    D2, after swapping L3 for L2.\n   U does not send a copy back to D1.\n   Note
    that all labels used in this procedure are downstream-assigned\n   labels.\n   The
    method of unicast is a local matter, outside the scope of this\n   specification.
    \ The only requirement is that D1 will receive the copy\n   of the packet carrying
    label L1 and that D1 will process the packet\n   by looking up label L1.  (And
    similarly, D2 must receive the copy of\n   the packet carrying label L2 and must
    process the packet by looking\n   up label L2.)\n   Note that if the method of
    unicast is MPLS, U will need to push\n   another label on each copy of the packet
    before transmitting it.\n   This label needs to ensure that delivery of the packet
    to the\n   appropriate LSR, D1 or D2.  Use of penultimate-hop popping for that\n
    \  label is perfectly legitimate.\n"
  title: 5.  Targeted mLDP with Unicast Replication
- contents:
  - "6.  Targeted mLDP with Multicast Tunneling\n   Suppose that LSRs D1 and D2 are
    both setting up MP-LSP <R,X> and that\n   LSR U is the upstream LSR on each of
    their paths to R.  Since\n   multicast tunneling is being used, when U has a packet
    to send on\n   this MP-LSP, it does not necessarily send two copies, one to D1
    and\n   one to D2.  It may send only one copy of the packet, which will get\n
    \  replicated somewhere downstream in the multicast tunnel.  Therefore,\n   the
    label that gets bound to the MP-LSP must be an upstream-assigned\n   label assigned
    by U.  This requires a change from the procedures of\n   [mLDP].  D1 and D2 do
    not send Label Mapping messages to U; instead,\n   they send Label Request messages
    to U, following the procedures of\n   Section 4 of [LDP-UP], asking U to assign
    a label to the MP-LSP\n   <R,X>.  U responds with a Label Mapping message containing
    an\n   upstream-assigned label L (using the procedures specified in\n   [LDP-UP]).
    \ As part of the same Label Mapping message, U also sends\n   an Interface TLV
    (as specified in [LDP-UP]) identifying the multicast\n   tunnel in which data
    on the MP-LSP will be carried.  When U transmits\n   a packet on this tunnel,
    it first pushes on the upstream-assigned\n   label L and then pushes on the label
    that corresponds to the\n   multicast tunnel.\n   If the numerical value L of
    the upstream-assigned label is the value\n   3, defined in [LDP] and [RFC3032]
    as \"Implicit NULL\", then the\n   specified multicast tunnel will carry only
    the specified MP-LSP.\n   That is, aggregation of multiple MP-LSPs into a single
    multicast\n   tunnel is not being done.  In this case, no upstream-assigned label\n
    \  is pushed onto a packet that is transmitted through the multicast\n   tunnel.\n
    \  Various types of multicast tunnel may be used.  The choice of tunnel\n   type
    is determined by provisioning, or by some other method that is\n   outside the
    scope of this document.  [LDP-UP] specifies encodings\n   allowing U to identify
    an mLDP MP-LSP, and RSVP-TE P2MP LSP, as well\n   as other types of multicast
    tunnel.\n   Procedures for tunneling MP2MP LSPs through P2MP or MP2MP LSPs are\n
    \  outside the scope of this document.\n   If the multicast tunnel is an mLDP
    MP-LSP or an RSVP-TE P2MP LSP,\n   when U transmits a packet on the MP-LSP <R,X>,
    the upstream-assigned\n   label L will be the second label in the label stack.
    \ Penultimate-hop\n   popping MUST NOT be done, because the top label provides
    the context\n   in which the second label is to be interpreted.  See [RFC5331].\n
    \  When LSR U uses these procedures to inform LSR D that a particular\n   MP-LSP
    is being carried in a particular multicast tunnel, U and D\n   MUST take appropriate
    steps to ensure that the packets U sends into\n   this tunnel will be received
    by D.  The exact steps to take depend on\n   the tunnel type.  As long as U is
    D's upstream LSR for any MP-LSP\n   that has been assigned to this tunnel, D must
    remain joined to the\n   tunnel.\n   Note that U MAY assign the same multicast
    tunnel for multiple\n   different MP-LSPs.  However, U MUST assign a distinct
    upstream-\n   assigned label to each MP-LSP.  This allows the packets traveling\n
    \  through the tunnel to be demultiplexed into the proper MP-LSPs.\n   If U has
    an MP-LSP <R1,X1> with downstream LSRs D1 and D2, and an MP-\n   LSP <R2,X2> with
    downstream LSRs D2 and D3, U may assign both MP-LSPs\n   to the same multicast
    tunnel.  In this case, D3 will receive packets\n   traveling on <R1,X1>.  However,
    the upstream-assigned label carried\n   by those packets will not be recognized
    by D3, hence D3 will discard\n   those packets.  Similarly, D1 will discard the
    <R2,X2> packets.\n   This document does not specify any rules for deciding whether
    to\n   aggregate two or more MP-LSPs into a single multicast tunnel.  Such\n   rules
    are outside the scope of this document.\n   Except for the procedures explicitly
    detailed in this document, the\n   procedures of [mLDP] and [LDP-UP] apply unchanged.\n"
