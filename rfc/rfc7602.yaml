  - "1.  Introduction\n   Intermediate System to Intermediate System (IS-IS) [ISO10589]
    has\n   been adopted widely in various Layer 2 / Layer 3 routing and\n   switching
    deployments of data centers and for critical business\n   operations.  Its flexibility
    and scalability make it well suited for\n   the rapid development of new data
    center infrastructures.  Also,\n   while technologies such as Software-Defined
    Networking (SDN) may\n   improve network management and enable new applications,
    their use has\n   an effect on the security requirements of the routing infrastructure.\n
    \  A replayed IS-IS PDU can potentially cause many problems in IS-IS\n   networks,
    including bouncing adjacencies, blackholing, and even some\n   form of Denial-of-Service
    (DoS) attacks as explained in Section 2.\n   This problem is also discussed in
    the Security Considerations\n   section, in the context of cryptographic authentication
    work as\n   described in [RFC5304] and [RFC5310].\n   Currently, there is no mechanism
    to protect IS-IS Hello (IIH) PDUs\n   and Sequence Number PDUs (SNPs) from replay
    attacks.  However, Link\n   State PDUs (LSPs) have a sequence number in the LSP
    header as defined\n   in [ISO10589], with which they can effectively mitigate
    intra-session\n   replay attacks.  But, LSPs are still susceptible to inter-session\n
    \  replay attacks.\n   This document defines the Extended Sequence Number (ESN)
    TLV to\n   protect IS-IS PDUs from replay attacks.\n   The new ESN TLV defined
    here thwarts these threats and can be\n   deployed with the authentication mechanisms
    specified in [RFC5304]\n   and [RFC5310] for a more secure network.\n   Replay
    attacks can be effectively mitigated by deploying a group key\n   management protocol
    (being developed as defined in [GROUP-IKEv2] and\n   [MRKMP]) with a frequent
    key change policy.  Currently, there is no\n   such mechanism defined for IS-IS.
    \ Even if such a mechanism is\n   defined, usage of this TLV can be helpful to
    avoid replays before the\n   keys are changed.\n   Also, it is believed that,
    even when such a key management system is\n   deployed, there always will be some
    systems based on manual keying\n   that coexist with systems based on key management
    protocols.  The ESN\n   TLV defined in this document is helpful for such deployments.\n"

      information.  Packets can be replayed later on the\n   broadcast network, and
      this may cause all ISs to bounce the\n   adjacency, thus churning the network.

    \          Figure 1: Extended Sequence Number (ESN) TLV\n   The ESN TLV defined
    here is optional.  Though this is an optional\n   TLV, it can be mandatory on
    a link when 'verify' mode is enabled as\n   specified in Section 5.1.  The ESN
    TLV MAY be present only in IIH\n   PDUs and SNPs.  A PDU with multiple ESN TLVs
    is invalid and MUST be\n   discarded on receipt.\n   The 64-bit ESSN MUST be nonzero
    and MUST contain a number that is\n   increased whenever it is changed due any
    situation, as specified in\n   Section 3.1.  Encoding the 64-bit unsigned integer
    ESSN value is a\n   local matter, and implementations MAY use one of the alternatives\n
    \  provided in Appendix A.  Effectively, for each PDU that contains the\n   ESN
    TLV, the 96-bit unsigned integer value consisting of the 64-bit\n   ESSN and 32-bit
    Packet Sequence Number (PSN) -- where the ESSN is the\n   higher-order 64 bits
    -- MUST be greater than the most recently\n   received value in a PDU of the same

  - "5.  Backward Compatibility and Deployment\n   The implementation and deployment
    of the ESN TLV can be done to\n   support backward compatibility and gradual deployment
    in the network\n   without requiring a flag day.  This feature can also be deployed
    for\n   the links in a certain area of the network where the maximum security\n
    \  mechanism is needed, or it can be deployed for the entire network.\n   The
    implementation SHOULD allow the configuration of ESN TLV features\n   on each
    IS-IS link level.  The implementation SHOULD also allow\n   operators to control
    the configuration of the 'send' and/or 'verify'\n   feature of IS-IS PDUs for
    the links and for the node.  In this\n   document, the 'send' mode is to include
    the ESN TLV in its own IS-IS\n   PDUs, and the 'verify' mode is to process the
    ESN TLV in the\n   receiving IS-IS PDUs from neighbors.\n   When an adversary
    is actively attacking, it is possible to have\n   inconsistent data views in the
    network, if there is a considerable\n   delay in enabling the 'verify' mode where
    nodes were configured to\n   the 'send' mode, e.g., from the first to the last
    node or all nodes\n   of a particular LAN segment.  This happens primarily because
    replay\n   PDUs can potentially be accepted by the nodes where the 'verify' mode\n
    \  is still not provisioned at the time of the attack.  To minimize such\n   a
    window, it is recommended that provisioning of 'verify' SHOULD be\n   done in
    a timely fashion by the network operators.\n"
  - contents:
    - "5.1.  IIHs and SNPs\n   On the link level, the ESN TLV involves the IIH PDUs
      and SNPs (both\n   CSNP and PSNP).  The 'send' and 'verify' modes described
      above can be\n   set independently on each link and, in the case of a broadcast\n
      \  network, independently on each level.\n   To introduce ESN support without
      disrupting operations, ISs on a\n   given interface are first configured to
      operate in 'send' mode.  Once\n   all routers operating on an interface are
      operating in 'send' mode,\n   'verify' mode can be enabled on each IS.  Once
      'verify' mode is set\n   for an interface, all the IIH PDUs and SNPs being sent
      on that\n   interface MUST contain the ESN TLV.  Any such PDU received without
      an\n   ESN TLV MUST be discarded when 'verify' mode is enabled.  Similarly,\n
      \  to safely disable ESN support on a link, 'verify' mode is disabled on\n   all
      ISs on the link.  Once 'verify' mode is disabled on all routers\n   operating
      on an interface, 'send' mode can be disabled on each IS.\n   Please refer to
      Section 5 for considerations on enabling or disabling\n   'verify' mode on all
      ISs on a link.\n"

      encoding the 64-bit ESN value\n   with the current system time that it does
      not default to any previous\n   value or some default node time of the system,
      especially after cold\n   restarts or any other similar events.  In general,
      system time must\n   be preserved across cold restarts in order for this mechanism
      to be\n   feasible.  One example of such implementation is to use a battery\n
      \  backed real-time clock (RTC).\n"

    - "A.2.  Using Non-volatile Storage\n   One other mechanism for accomplishing
      this is similar to the one\n   specified in [RFC7474] -- use the 64-bit ESSN
      as a wrap/boot count\n   stored in non-volatile storage.  This value is incremented
      anytime\n   the IS-IS node loses its sequence number state, including when the\n
      \  Packet Sequence Number wraps.\n   There is a drawback to this approach, which
      is described as follows\n   in Section 8 of [RFC7474].  It requires the IS-IS
      implementation to\n   be able to save its boot count in non-volatile storage.
      \ If the non-\n   volatile storage is ever repaired or router hardware is upgraded
      such\n   that the contents are lost, keys MUST be changed to prevent replay\n
      \  attacks.\n"

  - "Appendix B.  Operational/Implementation Considerations\n   Since the ESN is maintained
    per PDU type, per originator, and per\n   link, this scheme can be useful for
    monitoring the health of the\n   IS-IS adjacency.  A Packet Sequence Number skip
    that occurs upon\n   receiving an IIH can be recorded by the neighbors and can
    be used\n   later to correlate adjacency state changes over the interface.  For\n
    \  instance, in multi-access media, completely different issues on the\n   network
    may be indicated when all neighbors record skips from the\n   same IIH sender
    versus when only one neighbor records skips.  For\n   operational issues, effective
    usage of the TLV defined in this\n   document MAY also need more system information
    before making concrete\n   conclusions; defining all that information is beyond
    the scope of\n   this document.\n"
