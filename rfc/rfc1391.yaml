  - "Abstract\n   Over the last two years, the attendance at Internet Engineering\
    \ Task\n   Force (IETF) Plenary meetings has grown phenomenally.  Approximately\n\
    \   38% of the attendees are new to the IETF at each meeting.  About 33%\n   of\
    \ those go on to become regular attendees.  When the meetings were\n   smaller,\
    \ it wasn't very difficult for a newcomer to get to know\n   people and get into\
    \ the swing of things.  Today, however, a newcomer\n   meets many more new people,\
    \ some previously known only as the authors\n   of Request For Comments (RFC)\
    \ documents or thought provoking email\n   messages.\n   The purpose of this For\
    \ Your Information (FYI) RFC is to explain to\n   the newcomers how the IETF works.\
    \  This will give them a warm, fuzzy\n   feeling and enable them to make the meeting\
    \ more productive for\n   everyone.  This FYI will also provide the mundane bits\
    \ of information\n   which everyone who attends an IETF meeting should know.\n"

- title: What is the IETF?
  contents:
  - "What is the IETF?\n   The IETF is the protocol engineering, development, and\n\
    \   standardization arm of the Internet Architecture Board (IAB).  Its\n   mission\
    \ includes:\n   o  Identifying, and proposing solutions to, pressing operational\
    \ and\n      technical problems in the Internet;\n   o  Specifying the development\
    \ or usage of protocols and the near-term\n      architecture to solve such technical\
    \ problems for the Internet;\n   o  Making recommendations to the IAB regarding\
    \ standardization of\n      protocols and protocol usage in the Internet;\n  \
    \ o  Facilitating technology transfer from the Internet Research Task\n      Force\
    \ (IRTF) to the wider Internet community; and\n   o  Providing a forum for the\
    \ exchange of information within the\n      Internet community between vendors,\
    \ users, researchers, agency\n      contractors, and network managers.\n   The\
    \ IETF Plenary meeting is not a conference, although there are\n   technical presentations.\
    \  The IETF is not a traditional standards\n   organization, although many standards\
    \ are produced.  The IETF is the\n   volunteers who meet three times a year to\
    \ fulfill the IETF mission.\n   There is no membership in the IETF.  Anyone may\
    \ register for and\n   attend any meeting.  The closest thing there is to being\
    \ an IETF\n   member is being on the IETF mailing lists (see the IETF Mailing\
    \ Lists\n   section).  This is where the best information about current IETF\n\
    \   activities and focus can be found.\n"
- title: Humble Beginnings
  contents:
  - "Humble Beginnings\n   The first IETF meeting was held in January, 1986 at Linkabit\
    \ in San\n   Diego with 15 attendees.  The 4th IETF, held at SRI in Menlo Park\
    \ in\n   October, 1986, was the first at which non-government vendors\n   attended.\
    \  The concept of Working Groups (WG) was introduced at the\n   5th IETF meeting\
    \ at the NASA Ames Research Center in California in\n   February, 1987.  The 7th\
    \ IETF, held at MITRE in McLean, Virginia in\n   July, 1987, was the first meeting\
    \ with over 100 attendees.\n   The 14th IETF meeting was held at Stanford University\
    \ in July, 1989.\n   It marked a major change in the structure of the IETF universe.\
    \  The\n   IAB (then, Internet Activities Board), which until that time oversaw\n\
    \   many Task Forces, changed its structure to leave only two: the IETF\n   and\
    \ the IRTF.  The IRTF is tasked to consider the long-term research\n   problems\
    \ in the Internet.  The IETF also changed.  Those changes are\n   visible in today's\
    \ hierarchy.\n"
- title: The Hierarchy
  contents:
  - "The Hierarchy\n   To completely understand the structure of the IETF, it is useful\
    \ to\n   understand the overall structure in which the IETF resides.  The\n  \
    \ Internet Society (ISOC), formed in January 1992, provides the\n   official parent\
    \ organization for the IETF.  The ISOC Board of\n   Trustees appoints the members\
    \ of the IAB.  The IETF and IRTF Chairs\n   are also IAB members.  The IAB provides\
    \ the final technical review of\n   Internet standards.  They also provide leadership\
    \ in the IETF, by\n   virtue of their skills and years of experience.\n   The\
    \ IETF is divided into nine functional Areas.  They are:\n   Applications, Internet\
    \ Services, Network Management, Operational\n   Requirements, OSI Integration,\
    \ Routing, Security, Transport and\n   Services, and User Services.  Each Area\
    \ has at least one Area\n   Director.  There is also an Area Director who oversees\
    \ Standards\n   Management.  The Area Directors, along with the IETF Chair, form\
    \ the\n   Internet Engineering Steering Group (IESG).  Phillip Gross has been\n\
    \   the IETF Chair since the IETF's 7th meeting.  He founded the IESG and\n  \
    \ serves as its Chair as well.  The IESG provides the first technical\n   review\
    \ of Internet standards.  They are also responsible for the\n   day-to-day \"\
    management\" of the IETF.\n   Each Area has several Working Groups.  A Working\
    \ Group is a group of\n   people who work under a charter to achieve a certain\
    \ goal.  That goal\n   may be the creation of an informational document, the creation\
    \ of a\n   protocol standard, or the resolution of problems in the Internet.\n\
    \   Most Working Groups have a finite lifetime.  That is, once a Working\n   Group\
    \ has achieved its goal, it disbands.  As in the IETF, there is\n   no official\
    \ membership for a Working Group.  Unofficially, a Working\n   Group member is\
    \ somebody who's on that Working Group's mailing list.\n   Anyone may attend a\
    \ Working Group meeting (see the Be Prepared\n   section below).\n   Areas may\
    \ also have Birds of a Feather (BOF) groups.  They generally\n   have the same\
    \ goals as Working Groups, except that they have no\n   charter and usually only\
    \ meet once or twice.  BOFs are often held to\n   determine if there is enough\
    \ interest to form a Working Group.\n"
- title: IETF Mailing Lists
  contents:
  - "IETF Mailing Lists\n   Anyone who plans to attend an IETF meeting should join\
    \ the IETF\n   announcements mailing list.  This is where all of the meeting\n\
    \   information, new and revised Internet-Draft and RFC announcements,\n   IESG\
    \ Recommendations, and Last Calls are posted.  People who'd like\n   to \"get\
    \ technical\" may also join the IETF discussion list,\n   \"ietf@cnri.reston.va.us\"\
    .  This was the only list before the\n   announcement list was created and is\
    \ where discussions of cosmic\n   significance are held (most Working Groups have\
    \ their own mailing\n   lists for discussions relating to their work).  To join\
    \ the IETF\n   announcement list, send a request to:\n        ietf-announce-request@cnri.reston.va.us\n\
    \   To join the IETF discussion list, send a request to:\n        ietf-request@cnri.reston.va.us\n\
    \   To join both of the lists, simply send a single message, to either\n   \"\
    -request\" address, and indicate that you'd like to join both mailing\n   lists.\n\
    \   Do not, ever, under any circumstances, for any reason, send a request\n  \
    \ to join a list to the list itself!  The thousands of people on the\n   list\
    \ don't need, or want, to know when a new person joins.\n   Similarly, when changing\
    \ email addresses or leaving a list, send your\n   request only to the \"-request\"\
    \ address, not to the main list.  This\n   means you!!\n   The IETF discussion\
    \ list is unmoderated.  This means that anyone can\n   express their opinions\
    \ about issues affecting the Internet.  However,\n   it is not a place for companies\
    \ or individuals to solicit or\n   advertise.  Only the Secretariat can send a\
    \ message to the\n   announcement list.\n   Even though the IETF mailing lists\
    \ \"represent\" the IETF membership at\n   large, it is important to note that\
    \ attending an IETF meeting does\n   not automatically include addition to either\
    \ mailing list.\n"
- title: Registration
  contents:
  - "Registration\n   As previously mentioned, all meeting announcements are sent\
    \ to the\n   IETF announcement list.  Within the IETF meeting announcement is\
    \ a\n   Registration Form and complete instructions for registering,\n   including,\
    \ of course, the cost.  The Secretariat highly recommends\n   that attendees preregister.\
    \  Early registration, which ends about one\n   month before the meeting, carries\
    \ a lower registration fee.  As the\n   size of the meetings has grown, so has\
    \ the length of the lines at the\n   registration desk.  Fortunately, there are\
    \ three lines: the\n   \"preregistered and prepaid\" line (which moves very quickly);\
    \ the\n   \"preregistered and on-site payment\" line (which moves a little more\n\
    \   slowly); and the \"registration and on-site payment\" line (take a\n   guess).\n\
    \   Registration is open all week.  However, the Secretariat highly\n   recommends\
    \ that attendees arrive for early registration, beginning at\n   6:00 P.M. (meeting\
    \ local time), on the Sunday before the opening\n   plenary.  Not only will there\
    \ be fewer people, but there will also be\n   a reception at which people can\
    \ get a byte to eat.  If the\n   registration lines are long, one can eat first\
    \ and try again when the\n   lines are shorter.  Newcomers are encouraged to attend\
    \ the IETF\n   Orientation on Sunday at 4:30 P.M.\n   Registered attendees (and\
    \ there isn't any other kind) receive a\n   Registration Packet.  It contains\
    \ a general orientation sheet, the\n   At-A-Glance sheet, a list of Working Group\
    \ acronyms, the most recent\n   Agenda, and a name tag.  The At-A-Glance is a\
    \ very important\n   reference and is used throughout the week.  It contains Working\n\
    \   Group/BOF room assignments and a map of room locations.  Attendees\n   who\
    \ prepaid will also find their receipt in their packet.\n"
- title: Dress Code
  contents:
  - "Dress Code\n   Since attendees must wear their name tags, they must also wear\
    \ shirts\n   or blouses.  Pants or skirts are also highly recommended.  Seriously\n\
    \   though, many newcomers are often embarrassed when they show up Monday\n  \
    \ morning in suits, to discover that everybody else is wearing T-\n   shirts,\
    \ jeans (shorts, if weather permits) and sandals.  There are\n   those in the\
    \ IETF who refuse to wear anything other than suits.\n   Fortunately, they are\
    \ well known (for other reasons) so they are\n   forgiven this particular idiosyncrasy.\n\
    \   The general rule is: \"dress for the weather.\"\n"
- title: Seeing Spots Before Your Eyes
  contents:
  - "Seeing Spots Before Your Eyes\n   Some of the people at the IETF will have a\
    \ little colored dot on\n   their name tags.  A few people have more than one.\
    \  These dots\n   identify people who are silly enough to volunteer to do a lot\
    \ of\n   extra work.  The colors have the following meanings:\n      red    -\
    \ IAB member\n      yellow - IESG member\n      blue   - Working Group/BOF chair\n\
    \      green  - Local host\n   Local hosts are the people who can answer questions\
    \ about the\n   terminal room, and restaurants and points of interest in the area.\n\
    \   It is important that newcomers to the IETF not be afraid to strike up\n  \
    \ conversations with people who wear these dots.  If the IAB and IESG\n   members,\
    \ and Working Group and BOF chairs, didn't want to talk to\n   anybody, they wouldn't\
    \ be wearing the dots in the first place.\n   To make life simpler for the Secretariat,\
    \ Registration Packets are\n   also coded with little colored dots.  These are\
    \ only for Secretariat\n   use, so the nobody else needs to worry about them.\n"
- title: Terminal Room
  contents:
  - "Terminal Room\n   One of the most important (depending on your point of view)\
    \ things\n   the local host does is provide Internet access to the meeting\n \
    \  attendees.  In general, the connectivity is excellent.  This is\n   entirely\
    \ due to the Olympian efforts of the local hosts, and their\n   ability to beg,\
    \ borrow and steal.  The people and companies who\n   donate their equipment,\
    \ services, and time are to be heartily\n   congratulated and thanked.\n   While\
    \ preparation far in advance of the meeting is encouraged, there\n   may be some\
    \ unavoidable \"last minute\" things which can be\n   accomplished in the terminal\
    \ room.  It may also be useful to people\n   who need to make trip reports or\
    \ status reports while things are\n   still fresh in their minds.\n"
- title: Social Event
  contents:
  - "Social Event\n   Another of the most important things organized and managed by\
    \ the\n   local hosts is the IETF social event.  The social event has become\n\
    \   something of a tradition at the IETF meetings.  It has been\n   immortalized\
    \ by Marshal Rose with his reference to \"many fine lunches\n   and dinners\"\
    \ [ROSE], and by Claudio and Julia Topolcic with their\n   rendition of \"Nerds\
    \ in Paradise\" on a pink T-shirt.\n   Newcomers to the IETF are encouraged to\
    \ attend the social event.\n   Everyone is encouraged to wear their name tags.\
    \  The social event is\n   designed to give people a chance to meet on a social,\
    \ rather than\n   technical, level.\n   Sometimes, the social event is a computer\
    \ or high-tech related event.\n   At the Boston IETF, for example, the social\
    \ was dinner at the\n   Computer Museum.  Other times, the social might be a dinner\
    \ cruise or\n   a trip to an art gallery.\n"
- title: Agenda
  contents:
  - "Agenda\n   The Agenda for the IETF meetings is a very fluid thing.  It is sent,\n\
    \   in various forms, to the IETF announcement list three times prior to\n   the\
    \ meeting.  The final Agenda is included in the Registration\n   Packets.  Of\
    \ course, \"final\" in the IETF doesn't mean the same thing\n   as it does elsewhere\
    \ in the world.  The final Agenda is simply the\n   version that went to the printers.\n\
    \   The Secretariat will announce Agenda changes during the morning\n   plenary\
    \ sessions.  Changes will also be posted on the bulletin board\n   near the IETF\
    \ Registration Table (not the hotel registration desk).\n   Assignments for breakout\
    \ rooms (that's where the Working Groups and\n   BOFs meet) and a map showing\
    \ the room locations make up the At-A-\n   Glance sheet (included in the Registration\
    \ Packets).  Room\n   assignments are as flexible as the Agenda.  Some Working\
    \ Groups meet\n   multiple times during a meeting and every attempt is made to\
    \ have a\n   Working Group meet in the same room each session.  Room assignment\n\
    \   changes are not necessarily permanent for the week.  Always check the\n  \
    \ At-A-Glance first, then the bulletin board.  When in doubt, check\n   with a\
    \ member of the Secretariat at the Registration Table.\n"
- title: Other General Things
  contents:
  - "Other General Things\n   The opening Plenary on Monday morning is the most heavily\
    \ attended\n   session.  It is where important introductory remarks are made,\
    \ so\n   people are encouraged to attend.\n   The guy wearing the suit is probably\
    \ Vint Cerf, the President of the\n   Internet Society and an IAB member.  If\
    \ you see a guy doing a strip\n   tease out of a suit, it's definitely Vint (but\
    \ don't come just to see\n   him do it again; he's only done it once in the Internet's\
    \ 20 year\n   history).\n   The IETF Secretariat, and IETFers in general, are\
    \ very approachable.\n   Never be afraid to approach someone and introduce yourself.\
    \  Also,\n   don't be afraid to ask questions, especially when it comes to jargon\n\
    \   and acronyms!\n   Hallway conversations are very important.  A lot of very\
    \ good work\n   gets done by people who talk together between meetings and over\n\
    \   lunches and dinners.  Every minute of the IETF can be considered work\n  \
    \ time (much to some people's dismay).\n   \"Bar BOFs\" are unofficial get-togethers,\
    \ usually in the late evening,\n   during which a lot of work gets done over drinks.\n\
    \   It's unwise to get between a hungry IETFer (and there isn't any other\n  \
    \ kind) and coffee break brownies and cookies, no matter how\n   interesting a\
    \ hallway conversation is.\n   IETFers are fiercely independent.  It's always\
    \ safe to question an\n   opinion and offer alternatives, but don't expect an\
    \ IETFer to follow\n   an order.\n   The IETF, and the plenary sessions in particular,\
    \ are not places for\n   vendors to try to sell their wares.  People can certainly\
    \ answer\n   questions about their company and its products, but bear in mind\
    \ that\n   the IETF is not a trade show.  This does not preclude people from\n\
    \   recouping costs for IETF related T-shirts, buttons and pocket\n   protectors.\n"

    \    later.  Payment MUST be accompanied by a completed registration\n      form.\n\
    \   o  Purchase orders are NOT accepted.  DD Form 1556 IS accepted.\n   o  Refunds\

- title: Mailing Lists and Archives
  contents:
  - "Mailing Lists and Archives\n   As previously mentioned, the IETF announcement\
    \ and discussion mailing\n   lists are the central mailing lists for IETF activities.\
    \  However,\n   there are many other mailing lists related to IETF work.  For\n\
    \   example, every Working Group has its own discussion list.  In\n   addition,\
    \ there are some long-term technical debates which have been\n   moved off of\
    \ the IETF list onto lists created specifically for those\n   topics.  It is highly\
    \ recommended that everybody follow the\n   discussions on the mailing lists of\
    \ the Working Groups which they\n   wish to attend.  The more work that is done\
    \ on the mailing lists, the\n   less work that will need to be done at the meeting,\
    \ leaving time for\n   cross pollination (i.e., attending Working Groups outside\

- title: Be Prepared
  contents:
  - "Be Prepared\n   This topic cannot be stressed enough.  As the IETF grows, it\
    \ becomes\n   more and more important for attendees to arrive prepared for the\n\
    \   Working Groups meetings they plan to attend.  This doesn't apply only\n  \
    \ to newcomers; everybody should come prepared.\n   Being prepared means having\
    \ read the documents which the Working\n   Group or BOF Chair has distributed.\
    \  It means having followed the\n   discussions on the Working Group's mailing\
    \ list or having reviewed\n   the archives.  For the Working Group/BOF Chairs,\
    \ it means getting all\n   of the documents out early enough (i.e., several weeks)\
    \ to give\n   everybody time to read them.  It also means announcing an agenda\
    \ and\n   sticking with it.\n   At the Chair's discretion, some time may be devoted\
    \ to bringing new\n   Working Group attendees up to speed.  In fact, long lived\
    \ Working\n   Groups have occasionally held entire sessions which were introductory\n\
    \   in nature.  As a rule, however, a Working Group is not the place to\n   go\
    \ for training.  Observers are always welcome, but they must realize\n   that\
    \ the work effort cannot be delayed for education.  Anyone wishing\n   to attend\
    \ a Working Group for the first time might seek out the Chair\n   prior to the\
    \ meeting and ask for some introduction.\n   Another thing, for everybody, to\
    \ consider is that Working Groups go\n   through phases.  In the initial phase\
    \ (say, the first two meetings),\n   all ideas are welcome.  The idea is to gather\
    \ all the possible\n   solutions together for consideration.  In the development\
    \ phase, a\n   solution is chosen and developed.  Trying to reopen issues which\
    \ were\n   decided more than a couple of meetings back is considered bad form.\n\
    \   The final phase (the last two meetings) is where the \"spit and\n   polish\"\
    \ are applied to the architected solution.  This is not the\n   time to suggest\
    \ architectural changes or open design issues already\n   resolved.  It's a bad\
    \ idea to wait until the last minute to speak out\n   if a problem is discovered.\
    \  This is especially true for people whose\n   excuse is that they hadn't read\
    \ the documents until the day before a\n   comments period ended.\n   Time at\
    \ the IETF meetings is a precious thing.  Working Groups are\n   encouraged to\
    \ meet between IETF meetings, either in person or by\n   video or telephone conference.\
    \  Doing as much work as possible over\n   the mailing lists would also reduce\
    \ the amount of work which must be\n   done at the meeting.\n"
- title: RFCs and Internet-Drafts
  contents:
  - "RFCs and Internet-Drafts\n   Originally, RFCs were just what the name implies;\
    \ they were requests\n   for comments.  The early RFCs were messages between the\
    \ ARPANET\n   architects about how to resolve certain problems.  Over the years,\n\
    \   RFCs became more formal.  It reached the point that they were being\n   cited\
    \ as standards, even when they weren't.\n   Internet Experiment Notes (IEN) were\
    \ created to become a new informal\n   document series about the early experimental\
    \ work on TCP and IP.  It\n   was thought that having \"Notes\" as part of the\
    \ name would prevent\n   them from being cited as standards.  As the work matured,\
    \ the\n   documentation was done as RFCs.\n   RFCs continue to be the important\
    \ documents about the Internet; there\n   are now two special sub-series within\
    \ the RFCs: FYIs and STDs.  The\n   For Your Information RFC sub-series was created\
    \ to document overviews\n   and things which are introductory.  Frequently, FYIs\
    \ are created by\n   the IETF User Services Area.  The STD RFC sub-series is new.\
    \  It was\n   created to identify those RFCs which do specify full Internet\n\
    \   Standards.  RFCs of every type have an RFC number by which they are\n   indexed\
    \ and by which they can be retrieved.  FYIs and STDs have FYI\n   numbers and\
    \ STD numbers, respectively, in addition to RFC numbers.\n   This makes it easier\
    \ for a new Internet user, for example, to find\n   all of the helpful, informational\
    \ documents, by looking in the FYI\n   index.  In addition, FYI and STD numbers\
    \ never change across a\n   document revision, while the RFC number does.\n  \
    \ Internet-Drafts (I-D) are working documents of the IETF.  Any group\n   (e.g.,\
    \ Working Group, BOF) or individual may submit a document for\n   distribution\
    \ as an I-D.  An I-D is valid for six months.  Recent\n   guidelines require that\
    \ an expiration date appear on every page of an\n   I-D.  An I-D may be updated,\
    \ replaced or obsoleted at any time.  It\n   is not appropriate to use I-Ds as\
    \ reference material or to cite them,\n   other than as a \"working draft\" or\
    \ \"work in progress\".\n   For additional information, read the following documents:\n\
    \   o  Request for Comments on Request for Comments [RFC1111]\n   o  F.Y.I. on\
    \ F.Y.I: Introduction to the F.Y.I notes [RFC1150]\n   o  Introduction to the\

    \ would cause a copy of RFC 951 (the leading zero in the\n   Doc-ID is required)\

    \ certain criteria, include\n   the following in the body of the message:\n  \
    \    LIST: RFC\n       Keywords: Gateway\n   This example would email a list of\
