- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   The goal of the ROHC WG is to develop header compression\
    \ schemes that\n   perform well over links with high error rates and long link\
    \ roundtrip\n   times.  The schemes must perform well for cellular links that\
    \ use\n   technologies such as Wideband Code Division Multiple Access (W-CDMA),\n\
    \   Enhanced Data rates for GSM Evolution (EDGE), and CDMA2000.  However,\n  \
    \ the schemes should also be applicable to other link technologies with\n   high\
    \ loss and long roundtrip times.\n   The main objective for ROHC has been robust\
    \ compression of IP/UDP/RTP\n   [5], but the WG is also chartered to develop new\
    \ header compression\n   solutions for IP/TCP [1], [2].  Because TCP traffic,\
    \ in contrast to\n   RTP, has usually been sent over reliable links, existing\
    \ schemes for\n   TCP, [3] and [4], have not experienced the same robustness problems\n\
    \   as RTP compression.  However, there are still many scenarios where\n   TCP\
    \ header compression will be implemented over less reliable links\n   [11], [12],\
    \ making robustness an important objective for the new TCP\n   compression scheme.\
    \  Other, equally important, objectives for ROHC\n   TCP compression are: improved\
    \ compression efficiency, enhanced\n   capabilities for compression of header\
    \ fields including TCP options,\n   and finally incorporation of TCP compression\
    \ into the ROHC framework\n   [6].\n"
- title: 2.  Header Compression Requirements
  contents:
  - "2.  Header Compression Requirements\n   The following requirements have, more\
    \ or less arbitrarily, been\n   divided into five groups.  The first group deals\
    \ with requirements\n   concerning the impact of a header compression scheme on\
    \ the rest of\n   the Internet infrastructure.  The second group defines what\
    \ kind of\n   headers must be compressed efficiently.  The third and fourth groups\n\
    \   concern performance requirements and capability requirements that\n   stem\
    \ from the properties of link technologies where ROHC TCP is\n   expected to be\
    \ used.  Finally, the fifth section discusses\n   Intellectual Property Rights\
    \ related to ROHC TCP compression.\n"
- title: 2.1.  Impact on Internet Infrastructure
  contents:
  - "2.1.  Impact on Internet Infrastructure\n   1.  Transparency: When a header is\
    \ compressed and then decompressed,\n       the resulting header must be semantically\
    \ identical to the\n       original header.  If this cannot be achieved, the packet\n\
    \       containing the erroneous header must be discarded.\n       Justification:\
    \ The header compression process must not produce\n       headers that might cause\
    \ problems for any current or future part\n       of the Internet infrastructure.\n\
    \       Note: The ROHC WG has not found a case where \"semantically\n       identical\"\
    \ is not the same as \"bitwise identical\".\n   2.  Ubiquity: Must not require\
    \ modifications to existing IP (v4 or\n       v6) or TCP implementations.\n  \
    \     Justification: Ease of deployment.\n       Note: The ROHC WG may recommend\
    \ changes that would increase the\n       compression efficiency for the TCP streams\
    \ emitted by\n       implementations.  However, ROHC cannot assume such\n    \
    \   recommendations will be followed.\n       Note: Several TCP variants are currently\
    \ in use on the Internet.\n       This requirement implies that the header compression\
    \ scheme must\n       work efficiently and correctly for all expected TCP variants.\n"
- title: 2.2.  Supported Headers and Kinds of TCP Streams
  contents:
  - "2.2.  Supported Headers and Kinds of TCP Streams\n   1.  IPv4 and IPv6: Must\
    \ support both IPv4 and IPv6.  This means that\n       all expected changes in\
    \ the IP header fields must be handled by\n       the compression scheme, and\
    \ commonly changing fields should be\n       compressed efficiently.  Compression\
    \ must still be possible when\n       IPv6 Extensions are present in the header.\
    \  When designing the\n       compression scheme, the usage of Explicit Congestion\
    \ Notification\n       (ECN) [10] should be considered as a common behavior. \
    \ Therefore,\n       the scheme must also compress efficiently in the case when\
    \ the\n       ECN bits are used.\n       Justification: IPv4 and IPv6 will both\
    \ be around for the\n       foreseeable future, and Options/Extensions are expected\
    \ to be\n       more commonly used.  ECN is expected to have a breakthrough and\n\
    \       be widely deployed, especially in combination with TCP.\n   2.  Mobile\
    \ IP: The kinds of headers used by Mobile IP{v4,v6} must be\n       supported\
    \ and should be compressed efficiently.  For IPv4 these\n       include headers\
    \ of tunneled packets.  For IPv6 they include\n       headers containing the Routing\
    \ Header and the Home Address\n       Option.\n       Justification: It is very\
    \ likely that Mobile IP will be used by\n       cellular devices.\n   3.  Generality:\
    \ Must handle all headers from arbitrary TCP streams.\n       Justification: There\
    \ must be a generic scheme that can compress\n       reasonably well for any TCP\
    \ traffic pattern.  This does not\n       preclude optimizations for certain traffic\
    \ patterns.\n   4.  IPSEC: The scheme should be able to compress headers containing\n\
    \       IPSEC subheaders where the NULL encryption algorithm is used.\n      \
    \ Justification: IPSEC is expected to be used to provide necessary\n       end-to-end\
    \ security.\n       Note: It is not possible to compress the encrypted part of\
    \ an ESP\n       header, nor the cryptographic data in an AH header.\n   5.  TCP:\
    \ All fields supported by [4] should be handled with efficient\n       compression,\
    \ as should be the cases when the SYN, FIN or TCP ECN\n       [10] bits are set.\n\
    \       Justification: These bits are expected to be commonly used.\n   6.  TCP\
    \ options: The scheme must support compression of packets with\n       any TCP\
    \ option present, even if the option itself is not\n       compressed.  Further,\
    \ for some commonly used options the scheme\n       should also provide compression\
    \ mechanisms for the options.\n       Justification: Because various TCP options\
    \ are commonly used,\n       applicability of the compression scheme would be\
    \ significantly\n       reduced if packets with options could not be compressed.\n\
    \       Note: Options that should be compressed are:\n                     - Selective\
    \ Acknowledgement (SACK), [8], [9]\n                     - Timestamp, [7]\n"
- title: 2.3.  Performance Issues
  contents:
  - "2.3.  Performance Issues\n   1.  Performance/Spectral Efficiency: The scheme\
    \ must provide low\n       relative overhead under expected operating conditions;\n\
    \       compression efficiency should be better than for RFC 2507 [4]\n      \
    \ under equivalent operating conditions.\n       Justification: Spectrum efficiency\
    \ is a primary goal.\n       Note: The relative overhead is the average header\
    \ overhead\n       relative to the payload.  Any auxiliary (e.g., control or\n\
    \       feedback) channels used by the scheme should be taken into\n       account\
    \ when calculating the header overhead.\n   2.  Losses between compressor and\
    \ decompressor: The scheme should\n       make sure losses between compressor\
    \ and decompressor do not\n       result in losses of subsequent packets, or cause\
    \ damage to the\n       context that results in incorrect decompression of subsequent\n\
    \       packet headers.\n       Justification: Even though link layer retransmission\
    \ in most\n       cases is expected to almost eliminate losses between compressor\n\
    \       and decompressor, there are still many scenarios where TCP header\n  \
    \     compression will be implemented over less reliable links [11],\n       [12].\
    \  In such cases, loss propagation due to header compression\n       could affect\
    \ certain TCP mechanisms that are capable of handling\n       some losses; loss\
    \ propagation could also have a negative impact\n       on the performance of\
    \ TCP loss recovery.\n   3.  Residual errors in compressed headers: Residual errors\
    \ in\n       compressed headers may result in delivery of incorrectly\n      \
    \ decompressed headers not only for the damaged packet itself, but\n       also\
    \ for subsequent packets, because errors may be saved in the\n       context state.\
    \  For TCP, the compression scheme is not required\n       to implement explicit\
    \ mechanisms for residual error detection,\n       but the compression scheme\
    \ must not affect TCP's end-to-end\n       mechanisms for error detection.\n \
    \      Justification: For links carrying TCP traffic, the residual error\n   \
    \    rate is expected to be insignificant.  However, residual errors\n       may\
    \ still occur, especially in the end-to-end path.  Therefore,\n       it is crucial\
    \ that TCP is not prevented from handling these.\n       Note: This requirement\
    \ implies that the TCP checksum must be\n       carried unmodified in all compressed\
    \ headers.\n       Note: The error detection mechanism in TCP may be able to detect\n\
    \       residual bit errors, but the mechanism is not designed for this\n    \
    \   purpose, and might actually provide rather weak protection.\n       Therefore,\
    \ although it is not a requirement of the compression\n       scheme, it should\
    \ be possible for the decompressor to detect\n       residual errors and discard\
    \ such packets.\n   4.  Short-lived TCP transfers: The scheme should provide mechanisms\n\
    \       for efficient compression of short-lived TCP transfers,\n       minimizing\
    \ the size of context initiation headers.\n       Justification: Many TCP transfers\
    \ are short-lived.  This may lead\n       to a low gain for header compression\
    \ schemes that, for each new\n       packet stream, requires full headers to be\
    \ sent initially and\n       allows small compressed headers only after the initialization\n\
    \       phase.\n       Note: This requirement implies that mechanisms for building\
    \ new\n       contexts that are based on information from previous contexts or\n\
    \       for concurrent packet streams to share context information should\n  \
    \     be considered.\n   5a. Moderate Packet Misordering: The scheme should efficiently\
    \ handle\n       moderate misordering (2-3 packets) in the packet stream reaching\n\
    \       the compressor.\n       Justification: This kind of misordering is common.\n\
    \   5b. Packet Misordering: The scheme must be able to correctly handle\n    \
    \   packet misordering and preferably compress when misordered\n       packets\
    \ are in the TCP stream reaching the compressor.\n       Justification: Misordering\
    \ happens regularly in the Internet.\n       However, because the Internet is\
    \ engineered to run TCP reasonably\n       well, excessive misordering will not\
    \ be common and need not be\n       handled with optimum efficiency.\n   6.  Processing\
    \ delay: The scheme should not contribute significantly\n       to the system\
    \ delay budget.\n"
- title: 2.4.  Requirements Related to Link Layer Characteristics
  contents:
  - "2.4.  Requirements Related to Link Layer Characteristics\n   1.  Unidirectional\
    \ links: Must be possible to implement (possibly\n       with less efficiency)\
    \ without explicit feedback messages from\n       decompressor to compressor.\n\
    \       Justification: There are links that do not provide a feedback\n      \
    \ channel or where feedback is not desirable for other reasons.\n   2.  Link delay:\
    \ Must operate under all expected link delay\n       conditions.\n   3.  Header\
    \ compression coexistence: The scheme must fit into the ROHC\n       framework\
    \ together with other ROHC profiles (e.g., [6]).\n   4.  Note on misordering between\
    \ compressor and decompressor:\n       When compression is applied over tunnels,\
    \ misordering often\n       cannot be completely avoided.  The header compression\
    \ scheme\n       should not prohibit misordering between compressor and\n    \
    \   decompressor, as it would therefore not be applicable in many\n       tunneling\
    \ scenarios.  However, in the case of tunneling, it is\n       usually possible\
    \ to get misordering indications.  Therefore, the\n       compression scheme does\
    \ not have to support detection of\n       misordering, but can assume that such\
    \ information is available\n       from lower layers when misordering occurs.\n"
- title: 2.5.  Intellectual Property Rights (IPR)
  contents:
  - "2.5.  Intellectual Property Rights (IPR)\n   The ROHC WG must spend effort to\
    \ achieve a high degree of confidence\n   that there are no known IPR claims that\
    \ cover the final compression\n   solution for TCP.\n   Justification: Currently\
    \ there is no TCP header compression scheme\n   available that can efficiently\
    \ compress the packet headers of modern\n   TCP, e.g., with SACK, ECN, etc.  ROHC\
    \ is expected to fill this gap by\n   providing a ROHC TCP scheme that is applicable\
    \ in the wide area\n   Internet, not only over error-prone radio links.  It must\
    \ thus\n   attempt to be as future-proof as possible, and only unencumbered\n\
    \   solutions, or solutions where the terms of any IPR are such that\n   there\
