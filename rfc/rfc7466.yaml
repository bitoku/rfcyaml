  - "Abstract\n   The link quality mechanism of the Mobile Ad Hoc Network (MANET)\n\
    \   Neighborhood Discovery Protocol (NHDP) enables \"ignoring\" some 1-hop\n \
    \  neighbors if the measured link quality from that 1-hop neighbor is\n   below\
    \ an acceptable threshold while still retaining the corresponding\n   link information\
    \ as acquired from the HELLO message exchange.  This\n   allows immediate reinstatement\
    \ of the 1-hop neighbor if the link\n   quality later improves sufficiently.\n\
    \   NHDP also collects information about symmetric 2-hop neighbors.\n   However,\
    \ it specifies that if a link from a symmetric 1-hop neighbor\n   ceases being\
    \ symmetric, including while \"ignored\" (as described\n   above), then corresponding\
    \ symmetric 2-hop neighbors are removed.\n   This may lead to symmetric 2-hop\
    \ neighborhood information being\n   permanently removed (until further HELLO\
    \ messages are received) if\n   the link quality of a symmetric 1-hop neighbor\
    \ drops below the\n   acceptable threshold, even if only for a moment.\n   This\
    \ specification updates RFC 6130 \"Mobile Ad Hoc Network (MANET)\n   Neighborhood\
    \ Discovery Protocol (NHDP)\" and RFC 7181 \"The Optimized\n   Link State Routing\
    \ Protocol Version 2 (OLSRv2)\" to permit, as an\n   option, retaining, but ignoring,\
    \ symmetric 2-hop information when the\n   link quality from the corresponding\
    \ 1-hop neighbor drops below the\n   acceptable threshold.  This allows immediate\
    \ reinstatement of the\n   symmetric 2-hop neighbor if the link quality later\
    \ improves\n   sufficiently, thus making the symmetric 2-hop neighborhood more\n\

- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   Section 14 of the MANET Neighborhood Discovery Protocol\
    \ (NHDP)\n   [RFC6130] contains a link admission mechanism known as \"link quality\"\
    \n   that allows a router using that protocol to \"take considerations\n   other\
    \ than message exchange into account for determining when a link\n   is and is\
    \ not a candidate for being considered as HEARD or\n   SYMMETRIC.\"  Specifically,\
    \ [RFC6130] permits a router to disallow\n   consideration of some of its 1-hop\
    \ neighbors for as long as the\n   quality of the link from that 1-hop neighbor\
    \ is below an acceptable\n   link quality threshold.\n   A feature of this mechanism\
    \ is that while the link quality remains\n   too low, the link information, established\
    \ by the exchange of HELLO\n   messages, is retained.  Thus, if the link quality\
    \ later goes above\n   the required threshold (note that a hysteresis mechanism\
    \ means that\n   two thresholds are used), then the link is immediately established\n\
    \   and will be immediately available for use.\n   [RFC6130] collects not only\
    \ 1-hop neighbor information, but also\n   information about symmetric 2-hop neighbors.\
    \  However, [RFC6130]\n   specifies that if a 1-hop neighbor was, but no longer\
    \ is, considered\n   symmetric, then the corresponding 2-Hop Tuples that may have\
    \ been\n   recorded for that 2-hop neighbor are to be removed without a\n   retention\
    \ mechanism for a (possibly temporary) loss due to link\n   quality.\n   This\
    \ means that if there is a short period in which link quality is\n   too low,\
    \ then when the link quality is re-established all 1-hop\n   neighbor information\
    \ is immediately available for use again.\n   However, the corresponding symmetric\
    \ 2-hop neighbor information has\n   been removed and is not available for use\
    \ until restored by receipt\n   of the next corresponding HELLO message.\n   This\
    \ specification describes how [RFC6130] can be modified to avoid\n   this situation\
    \ by retaining (but not using) 2-hop information,\n   similar to what is done\
    \ with 1-hop information.  This modification is\n   strictly optional, and routers\
    \ that do and do not implement it can\n   interwork entirely successfully (as\
    \ they also can with different link\n   quality specifications).  In addition,\
    \ by a suitable interpretation\n   (that ignored 2-Hop Tuples are not externally\
    \ advertised), this\n   change can be invisible to any other protocols using [RFC6130],\
    \ in\n   particular [RFC7181].  However, the impact on [RFC7181] when 2-Hop\n\
    \   Tuples are not so handled is also described (owing to the existence\n   of\
    \ implementations of that protocol that are not modularly separated\n   from [RFC6130]).\n\
    \   This specification therefore updates [RFC6130] and [RFC7181].\n   This update\
    \ to [RFC6130] does not change the definition of a\n   symmetric 2-hop neighbor\
    \ but adds new state information to each 2-Hop\n   Tuple of [RFC6130].  This is\
    \ to retain some 2-hop neighbor\n   information while recording it as currently\
    \ not to be used.  The new\n   state information and retained 2-Hop Tuples are\
    \ reflected in the\n   corresponding tables of the updated NHDP-MIB module [NHDP-MIB].\n"

  - "2.  Terminology\n   The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\"\
    , \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"NOT RECOMMENDED\"\
    , \"MAY\", and\n   \"OPTIONAL\" in this document are to be interpreted as described\
    \ in\n   [RFC2119].\n   Additionally, this document uses the terminology of [RFC6130]\
    \ and\n   [RFC7181].\n"
- title: 3.  Applicability Statement
  contents:
  - "3.  Applicability Statement\n   This specification updates [RFC6130].  The optimization\
    \ presented in\n   this specification is simply permissive, as it allows retaining\n\
    \   information that otherwise would have been removed but does not use\n   that\
    \ information except when it could have been used by [RFC6130].\n   This can,\
    \ in some cases, ensure that the symmetric 2-hop neighborhood\n   is more robust\
    \ against temporary link quality changes and\n   consequently yields a more stable\
    \ network.  The only other\n   consequence of this optimization is that state\
    \ for some otherwise\n   expired 2-Hop Tuples may be maintained for longer.\n\
    \   This specification also updates [RFC7181].  This could have been\n   avoided\
    \ had instead [RFC6130] been updated so as to make the changes\n   to it invisible\
    \ to any other protocol using it.  However, as it is\n   known that some implementations\
    \ of [RFC7181] are not independent of\n   the implementation of [RFC6130] that\
    \ they use, it is useful to\n   indicate the direct impact on [RFC7181].\n   A\
    \ router that implements the optimization described in this\n   specification\
    \ will interoperate successfully with routers that\n   implement [RFC6130] but\
    \ do not implement this optimization.\n"
