  - "1. Introduction\n   The Domain Name System (DNS) provides replicated distributed\
    \ secure\n   hierarchical databases which hierarchically store \"resource records\"\
    \n   (RRs) under domain names.\n   This data is structured into CLASSes and zones\
    \ which can be\n   independently maintained.  See [RFC 1034, 1035, 2136, 2181,\
    \ 2535]\n   familiarity with which is assumed.\n   This document covers, either\
    \ directly or by reference, general IANA\n   parameter assignment considerations\
    \ applying across DNS query and\n   response headers and all RRs.  There may be\
    \ additional IANA\n   considerations that apply to only a particular RR type or\n\
    \   query/response opcode.  See the specific RFC defining that RR type or\n  \
    \ query/response opcode for such considerations if they have been\n   defined.\n\
    \   IANA currently maintains a web page of DNS parameters.  See\n   <http://www.iana.org/numbers.htm>.\n\
    \   \"IETF Standards Action\", \"IETF Consensus\", \"Specification Required\"\
    ,\n   and \"Private Use\" are as defined in [RFC 2434].\n"

    \   The ID field identifies the query and is echoed in the response so\n   they\
    \ can be matched.\n   The QR bit indicates whether the header is for a query or\
    \ a response.\n   The AA, TC, RD, RA, AD, and CD bits are each theoretically meaningful\n\
    \   only in queries or only in responses, depending on the bit.  However,\n  \
    \ many DNS implementations copy the query header as the initial value\n   of the\
    \ response header without clearing bits.  Thus any attempt to\n   use a \"query\"\
    \ bit with a different meaning in a response or to define\n   a query meaning\
    \ for a \"response\" bit is dangerous given existing\n   implementation.  Such\
    \ meanings may only be assigned by an IETF\n   Standards Action.\n   The unsigned\
    \ fields query count (QDCOUNT), answer count (ANCOUNT),\n   authority count (NSCOUNT),\
    \ and additional information count (ARCOUNT)\n   express the number of records\
    \ in each section for all opcodes except\n   Update.  These fields have the same\
    \ structure and data type for\n   Update but are instead the counts for the zone\
    \ (ZOCOUNT),\n   prerequisite (PRCOUNT), update (UPCOUNT), and additional information\n\
    \   (ARCOUNT) sections.\n"
- title: 2.1 One Spare Bit?
  contents:
  - "2.1 One Spare Bit?\n   There have been ancient DNS implementations for which\
    \ the Z bit being\n   on in a query meant that only a response from the primary\
    \ server for\n   a zone is acceptable.  It is believed that current DNS\n   implementations\
    \ ignore this bit.\n   Assigning a meaning to the Z bit requires an IETF Standards\

- title: 3.1 RR TYPE IANA Considerations
  contents:
  - "3.1 RR TYPE IANA Considerations\n   There are three subcategories of RR TYPE\
    \ numbers: data TYPEs, QTYPEs,\n   and MetaTYPEs.\n   Data TYPEs are the primary\
    \ means of storing data.  QTYPES can only be\n   used in queries.  Meta-TYPEs\
    \ designate transient data associated with\n   an particular DNS message and in\
    \ some cases can also be used in\n   queries.  Thus far, data TYPEs have been\
    \ assigned from 1 upwards plus\n   the block from 100 through 103 while Q and\
    \ Meta Types have been\n   assigned from 255 downwards (except for the OPT Meta-RR\
    \ which is\n   assigned TYPE 41).  There have been DNS implementations which made\n\
    \   caching decisions based on the top bit of the bottom byte of the RR\n   TYPE.\n\
    \   There are currently three Meta-TYPEs assigned: OPT [RFC 2671], TSIG\n   [RFC\
    \ 2845], and TKEY [RFC 2930].\n   There are currently five QTYPEs assigned: *\

  contents:
  - "3.1.1 Special Note on the OPT RR\n   The OPT (OPTion) RR, number 41, is specified\

- title: 3.3 RR NAME Considerations
  contents:
  - "3.3 RR NAME Considerations\n   DNS NAMEs are sequences of labels [RFC 1035].\
    \  The last label in each\n   NAME is \"ROOT\" which is the zero length label.\
    \  By definition, the\n   null or ROOT label can not be used for any other NAME\
    \ purpose.\n   At the present time, there are two categories of label types, data\n\
    \   labels and compression labels.  Compression labels are pointers to\n   data\
    \ labels elsewhere within an RR or DNS message and are intended to\n   shorten\
    \ the wire encoding of NAMEs.  The two existing data label\n   types are sometimes\
    \ referred to as Text and Binary.  Text labels can,\n   in fact, include any octet\
    \ value including zero octets but most\n   current uses involve only [US-ASCII].\
    \  For retrieval, Text labels are\n   defined to treat ASCII upper and lower case\
    \ letter codes as matching.\n   Binary labels are bit sequences [RFC 2673].\n\
    \   IANA considerations for label types are given in [RFC 2671].\n   NAMEs are\
    \ local to a CLASS.  The Hesiod [Dyer 1987] and Chaos [Moon\n   1981] CLASSes\
    \ are essentially for local use.  The IN or Internet\n   CLASS is thus the only\
    \ DNS CLASS in global use on the Internet at\n   this time.\n   A somewhat dated\
    \ description of name allocation in the IN Class is\n   given in [RFC 1591]. \
