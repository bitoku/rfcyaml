This document is intended to be a source of information about the Russian Federal standard GOST R 34.12 2015 describing the block cipher with a block length of n 128 bits and a key length of k 256 bits, which is also referred to as "Kuznyechik".
This algorithm is one of the set of Russian cryptographic standard algorithms (called GOST algorithms).
The Russian Federal standard [GOST3412 2015] specifies basic block ciphers used as cryptographic techniques for information processing and information protection including the provision of confidentiality, authenticity, and integrity of information during information transmission, processing, and storage in computer aided systems.
The cryptographic algorithms specified in this standard are designed both for hardware and software implementation.
They comply with modern cryptographic requirements and put no restrictions on the confidentiality level of the protected information.
The standard applies to development, operation, and modernization of the information systems of various purposes.
The block cipher "Kuznyechik" [GOST3412 2015] was developed by the Center for Information Protection and Special Communications of the Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation with participation of the Open Joint Stock company "Information Technologies and Communication Systems" (InfoTeCS JSC).
GOST R 34.12 2015 was approved and introduced by Decree #749 of the Federal Agency on Technical Regulating and Metrology on June 19, 2015.
Terms and concepts in the standard comply with the following international standards:  ISO/IEC 10116
[ISO IEC10116] and  series of standards ISO/IEC 18033
The following terms and their corresponding definitions are used in the standard.
Definitions Definitions encryption algorithm: process that transforms plaintext into ciphertext
(Section 2.19 of [ISO IEC18033 1]), decryption algorithm: process that transforms ciphertext into plaintext
(Section 2.14 of [ISO IEC18033 1]), basic block cipher: block cipher that for a given key provides a single invertible mapping of the set of fixed length plaintext blocks into ciphertext blocks of the same length, block: string of bits of a defined length (Section 2.6 of [ISO IEC18033 1]), block cipher: symmetric encipherment system with the property that the encryption algorithm operates on a block of plaintext, i.e., a string of bits of a defined length, to yield a block of ciphertext
(Section 2.7 of [ISO IEC18033 1]), Note:
In GOST R 34.12 2015, it is established that the terms "block cipher" and "block encryption algorithm" are synonyms.
reversible transformation of data by a cryptographic algorithm to produce ciphertext, i.e., to hide the information content of the data
(Section 2.18 of [ISO IEC18033 1]), round key: sequence of symbols that is calculated from the key and controls a transformation for one round of a block cipher, key: sequence of symbols that controls the operation of a cryptographic transformation (e.g., encipherment and decipherment)
(Section 2.21 of [ISO IEC18033 1]), Note: In GOST R 34.12 2015, the key must be a binary sequence.
plaintext: unencrypted information (Section 3.11 of [ISO IEC10116]), key schedule: calculation of round keys from the key, decryption: reversal of a corresponding encipherment (Section 2.13 of [ISO IEC18033 1]), symmetric cryptographic technique:
cryptographic technique that uses the same secret key for both the originator's and the recipient's transformation (Section 2.32 of [ISO IEC18033 1]), cipher: alternative term for encipherment system (Section 2.20 of [ISO IEC18033 1]), and ciphertext: data that has been transformed to hide its information content (Section 3.3 of [ISO IEC10116]).
