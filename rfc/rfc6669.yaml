  - "1.1.  Scope\n   The MPLS Transport Profile (MPLS-TP) architectural framework\
    \ is\n   defined in [RFC5921], and it describes a common set of protocol\n   functions\
    \ that supports the operational models and capabilities\n   typical of such transport\
    \ networks.\n   Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM) plays a significant\n\
    \   role in carrier networks.  It provides methods for fault management\n   and\
    \ performance monitoring in both the transport and service layers,\n   in order\
    \ to improve their ability to support services with guaranteed\n   and strict\
    \ Service Level Agreements (SLAs) while reducing their\n   operational costs.\n\
    \   [RFC5654], in general, and [RFC5860], in particular, define a set of\n   requirements\
    \ for the OAM functionality for MPLS-TP Label Switched\n   Paths (LSPs), Pseudowires\
    \ (PWs), and Sections.\n   The OAM solution, developed by the joint IETF and ITU-T\
    \ MPLS-TP\n   project, has three objectives:\n   o  The OAM toolset should be\
    \ developed based on existing MPLS\n      architecture, technology, and toolsets.\n\
    \   o  The OAM operational experience should be similar to that in other\n   \
    \   transport networks.\n   o  The OAM toolset developed for MPLS-based transport\
    \ networks needs\n      to be fully interoperable with existing MPLS OAM tools\
    \ as\n      documented in Section 2.1.5. of [RFC5860].\n   The MPLS-TP OAM toolset\
    \ is based on the following existing tools:\n   o  LSP ping, as defined in [RFC4379].\n\
    \   o  Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD), as defined in [RFC5880]\n   \
    \   and refined in [RFC5884].\n   o  ITU-T OAM for the Ethernet toolset, as defined\
    \ in [Y.1731].  This\n      has been used as functionality guidelines for the\
    \ performance\n      measurement tools that were not previously supported in MPLS.\n\
    \   Note that certain extensions and adjustments have been specified,\n   relative\
    \ to the existing MPLS tools, in order to conform to the\n   transport environment\
    \ and the requirements of MPLS-TP.  However,\n   compatibility with the existing\
    \ MPLS tools has been maintained.\n   This document provides an overview of the\
    \ MPLS-TP OAM toolset, which\n   consists of tools for MPLS-TP fault management\
    \ and performance\n   monitoring.  This overview includes a brief recap of MPLS-TP\
    \ OAM\n   requirements, their functions, and the generic mechanisms used to\n\
    \   support the MPLS-TP OAM operation.\n   The protocol definitions for individual\
    \ MPLS-TP OAM tools are\n   specified in separate RFCs (or Working Group documents),\
    \ which are\n   referenced by this document.\n   In addition, this document includes\
    \ a table that cross-references the\n   solution documents of the OAM functionality\
    \ supported.  Finally, the\n   document presents the applicability and utilization\
    \ of each tool in\n   the MPLS-TP OAM toolset.\n"

- title: 2.  Basic OAM Infrastructure Functionality
  contents:
  - "2.  Basic OAM Infrastructure Functionality\n   [RFC5860] defines a set of requirements\
    \ for OAM architecture and\n   general principles of operations, which are evaluated\
    \ below:\n   [RFC5860] requires that --\n   o  OAM mechanisms in MPLS-TP are independent\
    \ of the transmission\n      media and the client service being emulated by the\
    \ PW ([RFC5860],\n      Section 2.1.2).\n   o  MPLS-TP OAM must be able to support\
    \ both an IP-based and non-IP-\n      based environment.  If the network is IP\
    \ based, i.e., IP routing\n      and forwarding are available, then it must be\
    \ possible to choose\n      to make use of IP capabilities.  On the other hand,\
    \ in\n      environments where IP functionality is not available, the OAM\n  \
    \    tools must still be able to operate independent of IP forwarding\n      and\
    \ routing ([RFC5860], Section 2.1.4).  It is required to have\n      OAM interoperability\
    \ between distinct domains materializing the\n      environments ([RFC5860], Section\
    \ 2.1.5).\n   o  All OAM protocols support identification information, at least\
    \ in\n      the form of IP addressing structure, and are extensible to support\n\
    \      additional identification schemes ([RFC5860], Section 2.1.4).\n   o  OAM\
    \ packets and the user traffic are congruent (i.e., OAM packets\n      are transmitted\
    \ in-band) and there is a need to differentiate OAM\n      packets from user-plane\
    \ packets [RFC5860], Section 2.1.3.\n      Inherent in this requirement is the\
    \ principle that full operation\n      of the MPLS-TP OAM must be possible independently\
    \ of the control\n      or management plane used to operate the network [RFC5860],\
    \ Section\n      2.1.3.\n   o  MPLS-TP OAM supports point-to-point bidirectional\
    \ PWs, point-to-\n      point co-routed bidirectional LSPs, and point-to-point\n\
    \      bidirectional Sections ([RFC5860], Section 2.1.1).  The\n      applicability\
    \ of particular MPLS-TP OAM functions to point-to-\n      point associated bidirectional\
    \ LSPs, point-to-point unidirectional\n      LSPs, and point-to-multipoint LSPs,\
    \ is described in [RFC5860],\n      Section 2.2.  In addition, MPLS-TP OAM supports\
    \ these LSPs and PWs\n      when they span either single or multiple domains ([RFC5860],\n\
    \      Section 2.1.1).\n   o  OAM packets may be directed to an intermediate point\
    \ of an LSP/PW\n      ([RFC5860], Sections 2.2.3, 2.2.4, and 2.2.5).\n   [RFC5860],\
    \ Section 2.2 recommends that any protocol solution meeting\n   one or more functional\
    \ requirement(s) be the same for PWs, LSPs, and\n   Sections.\n   The following\
    \ document set addresses the basic requirements listed\n   above:\n   o  [RFC6371]\
    \ describes the architectural framework for conformance to\n      the basic requirements\
    \ listed above.  It also defines the basic\n      relationships between the MPLS\
    \ structures, e.g., LSP, PW, and the\n      structures necessary for OAM functionality,\
    \ i.e., the Maintenance\n      Entity Group (MEG), its end points, and intermediate\
    \ points.\n   o  [RFC5586] specifies the use of the MPLS-TP in-band control\n\
    \      channels.  It generalizes the applicability of the PW ACH to MPLS\n   \
    \   LSPs and Sections by defining a Generic Associated Channel\n      (G-ACh).\
    \  The G-ACh allows control packets to be multiplexed\n      transparently over\
    \ LSPs and Sections similar to that of PW VCCV\n      [RFC5085].  The Generic\
    \ Association Label (GAL) is defined by\n      assigning a reserved MPLS label\
    \ value and is used to identify the\n      OAM control packets.  The value of\
    \ the ACH Channel Type field\n      indicates the specific protocol carried on\
    \ the associated control\n      channel.  Each MPLS-TP OAM protocol has an IANA-assigned\
    \ channel\n      type allocated to it.\n   [RFC5085] defines an Associated Channel\
    \ Header (ACH) that provides a\n   PW associated control channel between a PW's\
    \ end points, over which\n   OAM and other control messages can be exchanged.\
    \  [RFC5586]\n   generalizes the PW Associated Channel Header (ACH) to provide\
    \ common\n   in-band control channels also at the LSP and MPLS-TP link levels.\n\
    \   The G-ACh allows control packets to be multiplexed transparently over\n  \
    \ the same LSP or MPLS-TP link as in PW VCCV.  Multiple control\n   channels can\
    \ exist between end points.\n   [RFC5085] also defines a label-based exception\
    \ mechanism that helps a\n   Label Switching Router (LSR) to identify the control\
    \ packets and\n   direct them to the appropriate entity for processing.  The use\
    \ of\n   G-ACh and GAL provides the necessary mechanisms to allow OAM packets\n\
    \   to run in-band and share their fate with data packets.  It is\n   expected\
    \ that all of the OAM protocols will be used in conjunction\n   with this Generic\
    \ Associated Channel.\n   o  [RFC6370] provides an IP-based identifier set for\
    \ MPLS-TP that can\n      be used to identify the transport entities in the network\
    \ and\n      referenced by the different OAM protocols.\n         Note: [MPLS-TP-ITU-Idents]\
    \ augments that set of identifiers to\n         include identifier information\
    \ in a format used by the ITU-T.\n         Other identifier sets may be defined\
    \ as well.\n"

  contents:
  - "3.1.  Continuity Check and Connectivity Verification\n   Continuity Check and\
    \ Connectivity Verification (CC-CV) are OAM\n   operations generally used in tandem\
    \ and complement each other.  These\n   functions are generally run proactively,\
    \ but may also be used\n   on-demand for diagnoses of a specific condition.  [RFC5860]\
    \ states\n   that the function should allow the MEPs to proactively monitor the\n\
    \   liveliness and connectivity of a transport path (LSP, PW, or a\n   Section)\
    \ between them.  In on-demand mode, this function should\n   support monitoring\
    \ between the MEPs and between a MEP and MIP.  Note\n   that as specified in [RFC6371],\
    \ Sections 3.3 and 3.4, a MEP and a MIP\n   can reside in an unspecified location\
    \ within a node, or in a\n   particular interface on a specific side of the forwarding\
    \ engine.\n   [RFC6371] highlights the need for the CC-CV messages to include\n\
    \   unique identification of the MEG that is being monitored and the MEP\n   that\
    \ originated the message.  The function, both proactively and in\n   on-demand\

    \ a pair of the\n   end points of a path (PW, LSP, or Section), as described in\n\
    \   [RFC5860], where:\n   o  One-way packet delay is the time elapsed from the\

- title: 5.2.  Diagnostic Tests and Lock Instruct
  contents:
  - "5.2.  Diagnostic Tests and Lock Instruct\n   [RFC6435] describes a protocol that\
    \ provides a mechanism to Lock and\n   Unlock traffic (e.g., data and control\
    \ traffic or specific OAM\n   traffic) at a specific LSR on the path of the MPLS-TP\
    \ LSP to allow\n   loopback of the traffic to the source.\n   These diagnostic\
    \ functions apply to associated bidirectional MPLS-TP\n   LSPs, including MPLS-TP\
    \ LSPs, bidirectional RSVP-Traffic Engineering\n   (RSVP-TE) tunnels (which is\
    \ relevant for the MPLS-TP dynamic control-\n   plane option with GMPLS), and\
    \ single-segment and multi-segment\n   Pseudowires.  [RFC6435] provides the protocol\
    \ definition for\n   diagnostic tests functions.\n   [RFC6435] defines a mechanism\
    \ where a lock instruction is sent by a\n   management application to both ends\
    \ of a point-to-point LSP,\n   requesting them to take the LSP out-of-service.\
    \  When an end point\n   gets the management request, it locks the LSP and sends\
    \ a Lock\n   Instruct message to the other end of the LSP.  The Lock Instruct\n\
    \   message is carried in a Generic ACH message and is sent periodically.\n  \
    \ The time between successive messages is no longer than the value set\n   in\
    \ the Refresh Timer field of the Lock Instruct message.  An LSP end\n   point\
    \ keeps the LSP locked while it is either receiving the periodic\n   Lock Instruct\
    \ messages or has an in-force lock instruction from the\n   management application.\n\
    \   Note that since the management application will receive a management\n   plane\
    \ response from both ends of the LSP confirming that the LSP has\n   been locked,\
    \ there is no requirement for the Lock Instruct message to\n   have a response.\
    \  Therefore, [RFC6435] does not define a Lock\n   Instruct response message.\n\
    \   The loopback operations include:\n   o  Lock: take an LSP out of service for\
    \ maintenance.\n   o  Unlock: Restore a previously locked LSP to service.\n  \
    \ o  Set_Full_Loopback and Set_OAM_Loopback.\n   o  Unset_Full_Loopback and Set_OAM_Loopback.\n\
    \   Operators can use the loopback mode to test the connectivity or\n   performance\
    \ (loss, delay, delay variation, and throughput) of a given\n   LSP up to a specific\
    \ node on the path of the LSP.\n"

- title: 6.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "6.  Security Considerations\n   This document, as an overview of MPLS OAM tools,\
    \ does not by itself\n   raise any particular security considerations.\n   The\
    \ general security considerations are provided in [RFC5920] and\n   [MPLS-TP-SEC].\
    \  Security considerations for each function within the\n   OAM toolset have been\
    \ recorded in each document that specifies a\n   particular functionality.\n \
    \  In general, OAM is always an area where the security risk is high.\n   For\
    \ example, confidential information may be intercepted by attackers\n   to gain\
    \ access to networks; therefore, authentication, authorization,\n   and encryption\
    \ must be enforced to prevent security breaches.\n   It is also important to strictly\
    \ follow operational security\n   procedures.  For example, in the case of MPLS-TP\
    \ static provisioning,\n   the operator interacts directly with the Network Management\
    \ System\n   (NMS) and devices, and it is critical in order to prevent human\n\
    \   errors and malicious attacks.\n   Since MPLS-TP OAM uses G-ACh, the security\
    \ risks and mitigations\n   described in [RFC5085] also apply here.  In short,\
    \ messages on the\n   G-ACh could be intercepted, or false G-ACh packets could\
    \ be inserted.\n   Additionally, DoS attacks can be mounted by flooding G-ACh\
    \ messages\n   to peer devices.  To mitigate this type of attack, throttling\n\
    \   mechanisms or rate limits can be used.  For more details, please see\n   [RFC5085].\n"
