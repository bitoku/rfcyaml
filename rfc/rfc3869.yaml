  - "1.  Introduction\n   This document discusses the history of funding for Internet\
    \ research,\n   expresses concern about the current state of such funding, and\n\
    \   outlines several specific areas that the IAB believes merit\n   additional\
    \ research.  Current funding levels for Internet research\n   are not generally\
    \ adequate, and several important research areas are\n   significantly underfunded.\
    \  This situation needs to be rectified for\n   the Internet to continue its evolution\
    \ and development.\n"
- title: 1.1.  Document Organization
  contents:
  - "1.1.  Document Organization\n   The first part of the document is a high-level\
    \ discussion of the\n   history of funding for Internet research to provide some\
    \ historical\n   context to this document.  The early funding of Internet research\
    \ was\n   largely from the U.S. government, followed by a period in the second\n\
    \   half of the 1990s of commercial funding and of funding from several\n   governments.\
    \  However, the commercial funding for Internet research\n   has been reduced\
    \ due to the recent economic downturn.\n   The second part of the document provides\
    \ an incomplete set of open\n   Internet research topics.  These are only examples,\
    \ intended to\n   illustrate the breadth of open research topics.  This second\
    \ section\n   supports the general thesis that ongoing research is needed to\n\
    \   further the evolution of the Internet infrastructure.  This includes\n   research\
    \ on the medium-time-scale evolution of the Internet\n   infrastructure as well\
    \ as research on longer-time-scale grand\n   challenges.  This also includes many\
    \ research issues that are already\n   being actively investigated in the Internet\
    \ research community.\n   Areas that are discussed in this section include the\
    \ following:\n   naming, routing, security, network management, and transport.\
    \  Issues\n   that require more research also include more general architectural\n\
    \   issues such as layering and communication between layers.  In\n   addition,\
    \ general topics discussed in this section include modeling,\n   measurement,\
    \ simulation, test-beds, etc.  We are focusing on topics\n   that are related\
    \ to the IETF and IRTF (Internet Research Task Force)\n   agendas.  (For example,\
    \ Grid issues are not discussed in this\n   document because they are addressed\
    \ through the Global Grid Forum and\n   other Grid-specific organizations, not\
    \ in the IETF.)\n   Where possible, the examples in this document point to separate\n\
    \   documents on these issues, and only give a high-level summary of the\n   issues\
    \ raised in those documents.\n"
- title: 1.2.  IAB Concerns
  contents:
  - "1.2.  IAB Concerns\n   In the aftermath of September 11 2001, there seems to\
    \ be a renewed\n   interest by governments in funding research for Internet-related\n\
    \   security issues.  From [Jackson02]: \"It is generally agreed that the\n  \
    \ security and reliability of the basic protocols underlying the\n   Internet\
    \ have not received enough attention because no one has a\n   proprietary interest\
    \ in them\".\n   That quote brings out a key issue in funding for Internet research,\n\
    \   which is that because no single organization (e.g., no single\n   government,\
    \ software company, equipment vendor, or network operator)\n   has a sense of\
    \ ownership of the global Internet infrastructure,\n   research on the general\
    \ issues of the Internet infrastructure are\n   often not adequately funded. \
    \ In our current challenging economic\n   climate, it is not surprising that commercial\
    \ funding sources are\n   more likely to fund that research that leads to a direct\
    \ competitive\n   advantage.\n   The principal thesis of this document is that\
    \ if commercial funding\n   is the main source of funding for future Internet\
    \ research, the\n   future of the Internet infrastructure could be in trouble.\
    \  In\n   addition to issues about which projects are funded, the funding\n  \
    \ source can also affect the content of the research, for example,\n   towards\
    \ or against the development of open standards, or taking\n   varying degrees\
    \ of care about the effect of the developed protocols\n   on the other traffic\
    \ on the Internet.\n   At the same time, many significant research contributions\
    \ in\n   networking have come from commercial funding.  However, for most of\n\
    \   the topics in this document, relying solely on commercially-funded\n   research\
    \ would not be adequate.  Much of today's commercial funding\n   is focused on\
    \ technology transition, taking results from non-\n   commercial research and\
    \ putting them into shipping commercial\n   products.  We have not tried to delve\
    \ into each of the research\n   issues below to discuss, for each issue, what\
    \ are the potentials and\n   limitations of commercial funding for research in\
    \ that area.\n   On a more practical note, if there was no commercial funding\
    \ for\n   Internet research, then few research projects would be taken to\n  \
    \ completion with implementations, deployment, and follow-up\n   evaluation.\n\
    \   While it is theoretically possible for there to be too much funding\n   for\
    \ Internet research, that is far from the current problem.  There\n   is also\
    \ much that could be done within the network research community\n   to make Internet\
    \ research more focused and productive, but that would\n   belong in a separate\
    \ document.\n"

- title: 2.1.  Prior to 1980
  contents:
  - "2.1.  Prior to 1980\n   Most of the early research into packet-switched networks\
    \ was\n   sponsored by the U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency\n  \
    \ (DARPA) [CSTB99].  This includes the initial design, implementation,\n   and\
    \ deployment of the ARPAnet connecting several universities and\n   other DARPA\
    \ contractors.  The ARPAnet originally came online in the\n   late 1960s.  It\
    \ grew in size during the 1970s, still chiefly with\n   DARPA funding, and demonstrated\
    \ the utility of packet-switched\n   networking.\n   DARPA funding for Internet\
    \ design started in 1973, just four years\n   after the initial ARPAnet deployment.\
    \  The support for Internet\n   design was one result of prior DARPA funding for\
    \ packet radio and\n   packet satellite research.  The existence of multiple networks\n\
    \   (ARPAnet, packet radio, and packet satellite) drove the need for\n   internetworking\
    \ research.  The Internet arose in large measure as a\n   consequence of DARPA\
    \ research funding for these three networks -- and\n   arise only incidentally\
    \ from the commercially-funded work at Xerox\n   PARC on Ethernet.\n"
- title: 2.2.  1980s and early 1990s
  contents:
  - "2.2.  1980s and early 1990s\n   The ARPAnet converted to the Internet Protocol\
    \ (IP) on January 1,\n   1983, approximately 20 years before this document was\
    \ written.\n   Throughout the 1980s, the U.S. Government continued strong research\n\
    \   and development funding for Internet technology.  DARPA continued to\n   be\
    \ the key funding source, but was supplemented by other DoD (U.S.\n   Department\
    \ of Defense) funding (e.g., via the Defense Data Network\n   (DDN) program of\
    \ the Defense Communication Agency (DCA)) and other\n   U.S. Government funding\
    \ (e.g., U.S. Department of Energy (DoE)\n   funding for research networks at\
    \ DoE national laboratories, (U.S.)\n   National Science Foundation (NSF) funding\
    \ for academic institutions).\n   This funding included basic research, applied\
    \ research (including\n   freely distributable prototypes), the purchase of IP-capable\n\
    \   products, and operating support for the IP-based government networks\n   such\
    \ as ARPAnet, ESnet, MILnet, the NASA Science Internet, and\n   NSFnet.\n   During\
    \ the 1980s, the U.S. DoD desired to leave the business of\n   providing operational\
    \ network services to academic institutions, so\n   funding for most academic\
    \ activities moved over to the NSF during the\n   decade.  NSF's initial work\
    \ included sponsorship of CSnet in 1981.\n   By 1986, NSF was also sponsoring\
    \ various research projects into\n   networking (e.g., Mills' work on Fuzzballs).\
    \  In the late 1980s, NSF\n   created the NSFnet backbone and sponsored the creation\
    \ of several NSF\n   regional networks (e.g., SURAnet) and interconnections with\
    \ several\n   international research networks.  NSF also funded gigabit networking\n\
    \   research, through the Corporation for National Research Initiatives\n   (CNRI),\
    \ starting in the late 1980s.  It is important to note that the\n   NSF sponsorship\
    \ was focused on achieving core NSF goals, such as\n   connecting scientists at\
    \ leading universities to NSF supercomputing\n   centers.  The needs of high-performance\
    \ remote access to\n   supercomputers drove the overall NSFnet performance.  As\
    \ a side\n   effect, this meant that students and faculty at those universities\n\
    \   enjoyed a relatively high-performance Internet environment.  As those\n  \
    \ students graduated, they drove both commercial use of the Internet\n   and the\
    \ nascent residential market.  It is no accident that this was\n   the environment\
    \ from which the world wide web emerged.\n   Most research funding outside the\
    \ U.S. during the 1980s and early\n   1990s was focused on the ISO OSI networking\
    \ project or on then-new\n   forms of network media (e.g., wireless, broadband\
    \ access).  The\n   European Union was a significant source of research funding\
    \ for the\n   networking community in Europe during this period.  Some of the\
    \ best\n   early work in gigabit networking was undertaken in the UK and Sweden.\n"
- title: 2.3.  Mid-1990s to 2003
  contents:
  - "2.3.  Mid-1990s to 2003\n   Starting in the middle 1990s, U.S. Government funding\
    \ for Internet\n   research and development was significantly reduced.  The premise\
    \ for\n   this was that the growing Internet industry would pay for whatever\n\
    \   research and development that was needed.  Some funding for Internet\n   research\
    \ and development has continued in this period from European\n   and Asian organizations\
    \ (e.g., the WIDE Project in Japan [WIDE]).\n   Reseaux IP Europeens [RIPE] is\
    \ an example of market-funded networking\n   research in Europe during this period.\n\
    \   Experience during this period has been that commercial firms have\n   often\
    \ focused on donating equipment to academic institutions and\n   promoting somewhat\
    \ vocationally-focused educational projects.  Many\n   of the commercially-funded\
    \ research and development projects appear\n   to have been selected because they\
    \ appeared likely to give the\n   funding source a specific short-term economic\
    \ advantage over its\n   competitors.  Higher risk, more innovative research proposals\n\
    \   generally have not been funded by industry.  A common view in Silicon\n  \
    \ Valley has been that established commercial firms are not very good\n   at transitioning\
    \ cutting edge research into products, but were\n   instead good at buying small\
    \ startup firms who had successfully\n   transitioned such cutting edge research\
    \ into products.\n   Unfortunately, small startup companies are generally unable\n\
    \   financially to fund any research themselves.\n"
- title: 2.4.  Current Status
  contents:
  - "2.4.  Current Status\n   The result of reduced U.S. Government funding and profit-focused,\n\
    \   low-risk, short-term industry funding has been a decline in higher-\n   risk\
    \ but more innovative research activities.  Industry has also been\n   less interested\
    \ in research to evolve the overall Internet\n   architecture, because such work\
    \ does not translate into a competitive\n   advantage for the firm funding such\
    \ work.\n   The IAB believes that it would be helpful for governments and other\n\
    \   non-commercial sponsors to increase their funding of both basic\n   research\
    \ and applied research relating to the Internet, and to\n   sustain these funding\
    \ levels going forward.\n"
- title: 3.  Open Internet Research Topics
  contents:
  - "3.  Open Internet Research Topics\n   This section primarily discusses some specific\
    \ topics that the IAB\n   believes merit additional research.  Research, of course,\
    \ includes\n   not just devising a theory, algorithm, or mechanism to accomplish\
    \ a\n   goal, but also evaluating the general efficacy of the approach and\n \
    \  then the benefits vs. the costs of deploying that algorithm or\n   mechanism.\
    \  Important cautionary notes about this discussion are\n   given in the next\
    \ sub-section.  This particular set of topics is not\n   intended to be comprehensive,\
    \ but instead is intended to demonstrate\n   the breadth of open Internet research\
    \ questions.\n   Other discussions of problems of the Internet that merit further\n\
    \   research include the following:\n   [CIPB02,Claffy03a,Floyd,NSF03a,NSF03b].\n"
- title: 3.1.  Scope and Limitations
  contents:
  - "3.1.  Scope and Limitations\n   This document is NOT intended as a guide for\
    \ public funding agencies\n   as to exactly which projects or proposals should\
    \ or should not be\n   funded.\n   In particular, this document is NOT intended\
    \ to be a comprehensive\n   list of *all* of the research questions that are important\
    \ to further\n   the evolution of the Internet; that would be a daunting task,\
    \ and\n   would presuppose a wider and more intensive effort than we have\n  \
    \ undertaken in this document.\n   Similarly, this document is not intended to\
    \ list the research\n   questions that are judged to be only of peripheral importance,\
    \ or to\n   survey the current (global; governmental, commercial, and academic)\n\
    \   avenues for funding for Internet research, or to make specific\n   recommendations\
    \ about which areas need additional funding.  The\n   purpose of the document\
    \ is to persuade the reader that ongoing\n   research is needed towards the continued\
    \ evolution of the Internet\n   infrastructure; the purpose is not to make binding\
    \ pronouncements\n   about which specific areas are and are not worthy of future\
    \ funding.\n   For some research clearly relevant to the future evolution of the\n\
    \   Internet, there are grand controversies between competing proposals\n   or\
    \ competing schools of thought; it is not the purpose of this\n   document to\
    \ take positions in these controversies, or to take\n   positions on the nature\
    \ of the solutions for areas needing further\n   research.\n   That all carefully\
    \ noted, the remainder of this section discusses a\n   broad set of research areas,\
    \ noting a subset of particular topics of\n   interest in each of those research\
    \ areas.  Again, this list is NOT\n   comprehensive, but rather is intended to\
    \ suggest that a broad range\n   of ongoing research is needed, and to propose\
    \ some candidate topics.\n"

- title: 3.2.1.  Domain Name System (DNS)
  contents:
  - "3.2.1.  Domain Name System (DNS)\n   The DNS system, while it works well given\
    \ its current constraints,\n   has several stress points.\n   The current DNS\
    \ system relies on UDP for transport, rather than SCTP\n   or TCP.  Given the\
    \ very large number of clients using a typical DNS\n   server, it is desirable\
    \ to minimize the state on the DNS server side\n   of the connection.  UDP does\
    \ this well, so it is a reasonable choice,\n   though this has other implications,\
    \ for example a reliance on UDP\n   fragmentation.  With IPv6, intermediate fragmentation\
    \ is not allowed\n   and Path MTU Discovery is mandated.  However, the amount\
    \ of state\n   required to deploy Path MTU Discovery for IPv6 on a DNS server\
    \ might\n   be a significant practical problem.\n   One implication of this is\
    \ that research into alternative transport\n   protocols, designed more for DNS-like\
    \ applications where there are\n   very many clients using each server, might\
    \ be useful.  Of particular\n   interest would be transport protocols with little\
    \ burden for the DNS\n   server, even if that increased the burden somewhat for\
    \ the DNS\n   client.\n   Additional study of DNS caching, both currently available\

    \ to be learned about the deployment of that or\n   other QoS mechanisms for end-to-end\
    \ QoS.  In addition to work on\n   purely technical issues, this includes close\
    \ attention to the\n   economic models and deployment strategies that would enable\
    \ an\n   increased deployment of QoS in the network.\n   In many cases, deployment\
    \ of QoS mechanisms would significantly\n   increase operational security risks\
    \ [RFC-2990], so any new research\n   on QoS mechanisms or architectures ought\
    \ to specifically discuss the\n   potential security issues associated with the\
    \ new proposal(s) and how\n   to mitigate those security issues.\n   In some cases,\
    \ the demand for QoS mechanisms has been diminished by\n   the development of\
    \ more resilient voice/video coding techniques that\n   are better suited for\
    \ the best-effort Internet than the older coding\n   techniques that were originally\
    \ designed for circuit-switched\n   networks.\n   One of the factors that has\
    \ blunted the demand for QoS has been the\n   transition of the Internet infrastructure\
    \ from heavy congestion in\n   the early 1990s, to overprovisioning in backbones\
    \ and in many\n   international links now.  Thus, research in QoS mechanisms also\
    \ has\n   to include some careful attention to the relative costs and benefits\n\
    \   of QoS in different places in the network.  Applied research into QoS\n  \
    \ should include explicit consideration of economic issues of deploying\n   and\
    \ operating a QoS-enabled IP network [Clark02].\n"

  contents:
  - "3.6.1.  Inter-Domain QoS Architecture\n   Typically, a router in the deployed\
    \ inter-domain Internet provides\n   best-effort forwarding of IP packets, without\
    \ regard for whether the\n   source or destination of the packet is a direct customer\
    \ of the\n   operator of the router.  This property is a significant contributor\n\
    \   to the current scalability of the global Internet and contributes to\n   the\
    \ difficulty of deploying inter-domain Quality of Service (QoS)\n   mechanisms.\n\
    \   Deploying existing Quality-of-Service (QoS) mechanisms, for example\n   Differentiated\
    \ Services or Integrated Services, across an inter-\n   domain boundary creates\
    \ a significant and easily exploited denial-of-\n   service vulnerability for\
    \ any network that provides inter-domain QoS\n   support.  This has caused network\
    \ operators to refrain from\n   supporting inter-domain QoS.  The Internet would\
    \ benefit from\n   additional research into alternative approaches to QoS, particularly\n\
    \   into approaches that do not create such vulnerabilities and can be\n   deployed\
    \ end-to-end [RFC-2990].\n   Also, current business models are not consistent\
    \ with inter-domain\n   QoS, in large part because it is impractical or impossible\
    \ to\n   authenticate the identity of the sender of would-be preferred traffic\n\
    \   while still forwarding traffic at line-rate.  Absent such an ability,\n  \
    \ it is unclear how a network operator could bill or otherwise recover\n   costs\
    \ associated with providing that preferred service.  So any new\n   work on inter-domain\
    \ QoS mechanisms and architectures needs to\n   carefully consider the economic\
    \ and security implications of such\n   proposals.\n"

- title: 3.7.  Congestion Control.
  contents:
  - "3.7.  Congestion Control.\n   TCP's congestion avoidance and control mechanisms,\
    \ from 1988\n   [Jacobson88], have been a key factor in maintaining the stability\
    \ of\n   the Internet, and are used by the bulk of the Internet's traffic.\n \
    \  However, the congestion control mechanisms of the Internet need to be\n   expanded\
    \ and modified to meet a wide range of new requirements, from\n   new applications\
    \ such as streaming media and multicast to new\n   environments such as wireless\
    \ networks or very high bandwidth paths,\n   and new requirements for minimizing\
    \ queueing delay.  While there are\n   significant bodies of work in several of\
    \ these issues, considerably\n   more needs to be done.\n   We would note that\
    \ research on TCP congestion control is also not yet\n   \"done\", with much still\
    \ to be accomplished in high-speed TCP, or in\n   adding robust performance over\
    \ paths with significant reordering,\n   intermittent connectivity, non-congestive\
    \ packet loss, and the like.\n   Several of these issues bring up difficult fundamental\
    \ questions\n   about the potential costs and benefits of increased communication\n\
    \   between layers.  Would it help transport to receive hints or other\n   information\
    \ from routing, from link layers, or from other transport-\n   level connections?\
    \  If so, what would be the cost to robust operation\n   across diverse environments?\n\
    \   For congestion control mechanisms in routers, active queue management\n  \
    \ and Explicit Congestion Notification are generally not yet deployed,\n   and\
    \ there are a range of proposals, in various states of maturity, in\n   this area.\
    \  At the same time, there is a great deal that we still do\n   not understand\
    \ about the interactions of queue management mechanisms\n   with other factors\
    \ in the network.  Router-based congestion control\n   mechanisms are also needed\
    \ for detecting and responding to aggregate\n   congestion such as in Distributed\
    \ Denial of Service attacks and flash\n   crowds.\n   As more applications have\
    \ the need to transfer very large files over\n   high delay-bandwidth-product\
    \ paths, the stresses on current\n   congestion control mechanisms raise the question\
    \ of whether we need\n   more fine-grained feedback from routers.  This includes\
    \ the challenge\n   of allowing connections to avoid the delays of slow-start,\
    \ and to\n   rapidly make use of newly-available bandwidth.  On a more general\n\
    \   level, we don't understand the potential and limitations for best-\n   effort\
    \ traffic over high delay-bandwidth-product paths, given the\n   current feedback\
    \ from routers, or the range of possibilities for more\n   explicit feedback from\
    \ routers.\n   There is also a need for long-term research in congestion control\n\
    \   that is separate from specific functional requirements like the ones\n   listed\
    \ above.  We know very little about congestion control dynamics\n   or traffic\
    \ dynamics of a large, complex network like the global\n   Internet, with its\
    \ heterogeneous and changing traffic mixes, link-\n   level technologies, network\
    \ protocols and router mechanisms, patterns\n   of congestion, pricing models,\
    \ and the like.  Expanding our knowledge\n   in this area seems likely to require\
    \ a rich mix of measurement,\n   analysis, simulations, and experimentation.\n"

  - "3.8.  Studying the Evolution of the Internet Infrastructure\n   The evolution\
    \ of the Internet infrastructure has been frustratingly\n   slow and difficult,\
    \ with long stories about the difficulties in\n   adding IPv6, QoS, multicast,\
    \ and other functionality to the Internet.\n   We need a more scientific understanding\
    \ of the evolutionary\n   potentials and evolutionary difficulties of the Internet\n\
    \   infrastructure.\n   This evolutionary potential is affected not only by the\
    \ technical\n   issues of the layered IP architecture, but by other factors as\
    \ well.\n   These factors include the changes in the environment over time (e.g.,\n\
    \   the recent overprovisioning of backbones, the deployment of\n   firewalls),\
    \ and the role of the standardization process.  Economic\n   and public policy\
    \ factors are also critical, including the central\n   fact of the Internet as\
    \ a decentralized system, with key players\n   being not only individuals, but\
    \ also ISPs, companies, and entire\n   industries.  Deployment issues are also\
    \ key factors in the evolution\n   of the Internet, including the continual chicken-and-egg\
    \ problem of\n   having enough customers to merit rolling out a service whose\
    \ utility\n   depends on the size of the customer base in the first place.\n \
    \  Overlay networks might serve as a transition technology for some new\n   functionality,\
    \ with an initial deployment in overlay networks, and\n   with the new functionality\
    \ moving later into the core if it seems\n   warranted.\n   There are also increased\
    \ obstacles to the evolution of the Internet\n   in the form of increased complexity\
    \ [WD02], unanticipated feature\n   interactions [Kruse00], interactions between\
    \ layers [CWWS92],\n   interventions by middleboxes [RFC-3424], and the like.\

- title: 3.10.  Internet Measurement
  contents:
  - "3.10.  Internet Measurement\n   A recurring challenge is measuring the Internet;\
    \ there have been many\n   discussions about the need for measurement studies\
    \ as an integral\n   part of Internet research [Claffy03].  In this discussion,\
    \ we define\n   measurement quite broadly.  For example, there are numerous\n\
    \   challenges in measuring performance along any substantial Internet\n   path,\
    \ particularly when the path crosses administrative domain\n   boundaries.  There\
    \ are also challenges in measuring\n   protocol/application usage on any high-speed\
    \ Internet link.  Many of\n   the problems discussed above would benefit from\
    \ increased frequency\n   of measurement as well as improved quality of measurement\
    \ on the\n   deployed Internet.\n   A key issue in network measurement is that\
    \ most commercial Internet\n   Service Providers consider the particular characteristics\
    \ of their\n   production IP network(s) to be trade secrets.  Ways need to be\
    \ found\n   for cooperative measurement studies, e.g., to allow legitimate non-\n\
    \   commercial researchers to be able to measure relevant network\n   parameters\
    \ while also protecting the privacy rights of the measured\n   ISPs.\n   Absent\
    \ measured data, there is possibly an over-reliance on network\n   simulations\
    \ in some parts of the Internet research community and\n   probably insufficient\
    \ validation that existing network simulation\n   models are reasonably good representations\
    \ of the deployed Internet\n   (or of some plausible future Internet) [FK02].\n\
    \   Without solid measurement of the current Internet behavior, it is\n   very\
    \ difficult to know what otherwise unknown operational problems\n   exist that\
    \ require attention, and it is equally difficult to fully\n   understand the impact\
