    the \"uniqueness\" requirement so that only Autonomous-System-\n   wide (AS-wide)

  - "1.  Introduction\n   Currently, the BGP Identifier of a BGP speaker is specified
    as a\n   valid IPv4 host address assigned to the BGP speaker [RFC4271].  In\n
    \  addition, the deployed BGP code requires that two BGP speakers be of\n   distinct
    BGP Identifiers in order to establish a BGP connection.\n   To accommodate situations
    where the current requirements for the BGP\n   Identifier are not met (such as
    in the case of an IPv6-only network),\n   this document relaxes the definition
    of the BGP Identifier to be a\n   4-octet, unsigned, non-zero integer and relaxes
    the \"uniqueness\"\n   requirement so that only AS-wide uniqueness of the BGP
    Identifiers is\n   required.  These revisions to the base BGP specification do
    not\n   introduce any backward compatibility issues.\n"

  - "2.  Protocol Revisions\n   The revisions to the base BGP specification [RFC4271]
    include the\n   definition of the BGP Identifier and procedures for a BGP speaker\n
    \  that supports the AS-wide Unique BGP Identifier.\n"
  - contents:
    - "2.1.  Definition of the BGP Identifier\n   For a BGP speaker that supports
      the AS-wide Unique BGP Identifier,\n   the BGP Identifier is specified as the
      following:\n      The BGP Identifier is a 4-octet, unsigned, non-zero integer
      that\n      should be unique within an AS.  The value of the BGP Identifier\n
      \     for a BGP speaker is determined on startup and is the same for\n      every
      local interface and every BGP peer.\n"

  - contents:
    - "2.2.  Open Message Error Handling\n   For a BGP speaker that supports the AS-wide
      Unique BGP Identifier,\n   the OPEN message error handling related to the BGP
      Identifier is\n   modified as follows:\n      If the BGP Identifier field of
      the OPEN message is zero, or if it\n      is the same as the BGP Identifier
      of the local BGP speaker and the\n      message is from an internal peer, then
      the Error Subcode is set to\n      \"Bad BGP Identifier\".\n"

    - "2.3.  Connection Collision Resolution\n   For a BGP speaker that supports the
      AS-wide Unique BGP Identifier,\n   the procedures for connection collision resolution
      are extended as\n   follows to deal with the case in which the two BGP speakers
      share the\n   same BGP Identifier (thus, it is only applicable to an external\n
      \  peer):\n      If the BGP Identifiers of the peers involved in the connection\n
      \     collision are identical, then the connection initiated by the BGP\n      speaker
      with the larger AS number is preserved.\n   This extension covers cases in which
      the 4-octet AS numbers are\n   involved [RFC4893].\n"

  title: 2.  Protocol Revisions
- contents:
  - "3.  Remarks\n   It is noted that a BGP Identifier allocated based on [RFC4271]
    fits\n   the revised definition.\n   In case of BGP Confederation, the whole confederation
    is considered\n   as one AS for the purpose of supporting the AS-wide Unique BGP\n
    \  Identifier.\n   A BGP speaker that supports the AS-wide Unique BGP Identifier
    cannot\n   share a BGP Identifier with its external neighbor until the remote\n
    \  BGP speaker is upgraded with software that supports the specified\n   revisions.\n
    \  In addition to the OPEN message, the BGP Identifier is currently also\n   used
    in the following areas:\n   o In the AGGREAGTOR attribute of a route where the
    combination of a\n     BGP Identifier and an AS number uniquely identifies the
    BGP speaker\n     that performs the route aggregation.\n   o In the Route Reflection
    within an AS, where only the BGP Identifier\n     of an internal neighbor may
    be propagated in the route reflection\n     related attributes.\n   o In the route
    selection, where the BGP Identifier is not used in\n     comparing a route from
    an internal neighbor and a route from an\n     external neighbor.  In addition,
    routes from BGP speakers with\n     identical BGP Identifiers have been dealt
    with (e.g., parallel BGP\n     sessions between two BGP speakers).\n   Therefore,
    it is concluded that the revisions specified in this\n   document do not introduce
    any backward compatibility issues with the\n   current usage of the BGP Identifier.\n"
