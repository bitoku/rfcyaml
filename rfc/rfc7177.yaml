  - "1.  Introduction\n   The IETF Transparent Interconnection of Lots of Links (TRILL)\n\
    \   protocol [RFC6325] provides optimal pair-wise data frame forwarding\n   without\
    \ configuration, safe forwarding even during transient loops,\n   and support\
    \ for transmission of both unicast and multicast traffic\n   taking advantage\
    \ of multiple paths in multi-hop networks with\n   arbitrary topology.  End stations\
    \ are connected to TRILL switches\n   with Ethernet, but TRILL switches can be\
    \ interconnected with\n   arbitrary link technology.  TRILL accomplishes this\
    \ by using [IS-IS]\n   (Intermediate System to Intermediate System) link-state\
    \ routing\n   [RFC1195] [RFC7176] and a header in TRILL Data packets that includes\n\
    \   a hop count.  The design supports data labeling by Virtual Local Area\n  \
    \ Networks (VLANs) and fine-grained labels [RFC7172] as well as\n   optimization\
    \ of the distribution of multi-destination frames based on\n   data label and\
    \ multicast groups.  Devices that implement TRILL are\n   called TRILL switches\
    \ or RBridges (Routing Bridges).\n   This document provides detailed specifications\
    \ for five of the link-\n   local aspects of the TRILL protocol used on broadcast\
    \ links (also\n   called LAN or multi-access links) and for the three of these\
    \ aspects\n   that are also used on point-to-point (P2P) links.  It includes state\n\
    \   diagrams and implementation details where appropriate.  Alternative\n   implementations\
    \ that interoperate on the wire are permitted.\n   The scope of this document\
    \ is limited to the following aspects of the\n   TRILL protocol; their applicability,\
    \ along with the most relevant\n   section of this document, are as shown here:\n\

  contents:
  - "1.1.  Content and Precedence\n   In cases of conflict between this document and\

    \ Hello protocol in\n   light of the environment for which the TRILL protocol\
    \ is designed.\n   It also describes the purposes of the TRILL Hello protocol.\n\
    \   Section 3 describes the adjacency state machine, its states, and its\n   relevant\

- title: 2.  The TRILL Hello Environment and Purposes
  contents:
  - "2.  The TRILL Hello Environment and Purposes\n   [IS-IS] has subnetwork-independent\
    \ functions and subnetwork-dependent\n   functions.  Currently, Layer 3 use of\
    \ IS-IS supports two types of\n   subnetworks: (1) point-to-point link subnetworks\
    \ between routers and\n   (2) general broadcast (LAN) subnetworks.  Because of\
    \ the differences\n   between the environment of Layer 3 routers and the environment\
    \ of\n   TRILL RBridges, instead of the subnetwork-dependent functions used at\n\
    \   Layer 3, which are specified in Sections 8.2 and 8.4 of [IS-IS], the\n   TRILL\
    \ protocol uses modified subnetwork-dependent functions for\n   point-to-point\
    \ subnetworks and broadcast (LAN) subnetworks.  The\n   differences between the\
    \ TRILL and Layer 3 environments are described\n   in Sections 2.1 through 2.4\
    \ followed by a summation, in Section 2.5,\n   of the purposes of the TRILL Hello\
    \ protocol.\n"
- title: 2.1.  RBridge Interconnection by Ethernet
  contents:
  - "2.1.  RBridge Interconnection by Ethernet\n   TRILL supports the interconnection\
    \ of RBridges by multi-access LAN\n   links such as Ethernet.  Because this includes\
    \ general bridged LANs\n   [802.1Q], the links between RBridges may contain devices\
    \ or services\n   that can restrict VLAN connectivity, such as [802.1Q] bridges\
    \ or\n   carrier Ethernet services.  In addition, RBridge Ethernet ports, like\n\
    \   [802.1Q] ports, can be configured to restrict input/output on a VLAN\n   basis.\n\
    \   For this reason, TRILL Data and TRILL IS-IS packets are sent on\n   Ethernet\
    \ links in a Designated VLAN that is assumed to provide\n   connectivity between\
    \ all RBridges on the link.  The Designated VLAN\n   is dictated for a LAN link\
    \ by the elected Designated RBridge on that\n   link (DRB, equivalent to the Designated\
    \ Intermediate System at\n   Layer 3).  On an RBridge Ethernet port configured\
    \ as point-to-point,\n   TRILL Data and IS-IS packets are sent in that port's\
    \ Desired\n   Designated VLAN, regardless of the state of any other ports on the\n\
    \   link.  Connectivity on an Ethernet link configured as point-to-point\n   generally\
    \ depends on both ends being configured with the same Desired\n   Designated VLAN.\
    \  Because TRILL Data packets flow between RBridges on\n   an Ethernet link only\
    \ in the link's Designated VLAN, adjacency for\n   routing calculations is based\
    \ only on connectivity characteristics in\n   that VLAN.\n   (Non-Ethernet links,\
    \ such as PPP [RFC6361] generally do not have any\n   Outer.VLAN labeling, so\
    \ the Designated VLAN for such links has no\n   effect.)\n"
- title: 2.2.  Handling Native Frames
  contents:
  - "2.2.  Handling Native Frames\n   This section discusses the handling of \"native\"\
    \ frames as defined in\n   Section 1.4 of [RFC6325].  As such, this section is\
    \ not applicable to\n   point-to-point links between TRILL switches or any link\
    \ where all the\n   TRILL switch ports on the link have been configured as \"\
    trunk ports\"\n   by setting the end-station service disable bit for the port\
    \ (see\n   Section 4.9.1 of [RFC6325]).\n   Layer 3 data packets, such as IP packets,\
    \ are already \"tamed\" when\n   they are originated by an end station: they include\
    \ a hop count and\n   Layer 3 source and destination address fields.  Furthermore,\
    \ for\n   ordinary data packets, there is no requirement to preserve any outer\n\
    \   Layer 2 addressing, and, if the packets are unicast, they are\n   explicitly\
    \ addressed to their first-hop router.\n   In contrast, TRILL switches must accept,\
    \ transport, and deliver\n   \"untamed\" native frames: native frames that lack\
    \ a hop count field\n   usable by TRILL and have Layer 2 MAC (Media Access Control)\
    \ addresses\n   that indicate their source and destination.  These Layer 2 addresses\n\
    \   must be preserved for delivery to the native frame's Layer 2\n   destination.\
    \  One resulting difference is that RBridge ports\n   providing native frame service\
    \ must receive in promiscuous MAC\n   address mode, while Layer 3 router ports\
    \ typically receive in a\n   selective MAC address mode.\n   TRILL handles these\
    \ requirements by having, on the link where an end\n   station originates a native\
    \ frame, one RBridge \"ingress\" such a\n   locally originated native frame by\
    \ adding a TRILL Header that\n   includes a hop count, thus converting it to a\
    \ TRILL Data packet.\n   This augmented packet is then routed to one RBridge on\
    \ the link\n   having the destination end station for the frame (or one RBridge\
    \ on\n   each such link if it is a multi-destination frame).  Such final\n   RBridges\
    \ perform an \"egress\" function, removing the TRILL Header and\n   delivering\
    \ the original frame to its destination(s).  (For the\n   purposes of TRILL, a\
    \ Layer 3 router is an end station.)\n   Care must be taken to avoid a loop that\
    \ would involve egressing a\n   native frame and then re-ingressing it because,\
    \ while it is in native\n   form, it would not be protected by a hop count and\
    \ could loop\n   forever.  Such a loop could, for multi-destination frames, even\n\
    \   involve multiplication of the number of frames each time around and\n   would\
    \ likely saturate all links involved within milliseconds.  For\n   TRILL, safety\
    \ against such loops for a link is more important than\n   transient loss of data\
    \ connectivity on that link.\n   The primary TRILL defense mechanism against such\
    \ loops, which is\n   mandatory, is to assure that, as far as practically possible,\
    \ there\n   is only a single RBridge that is in charge of ingressing and\n   egressing\
    \ native frames from and to a link where TRILL is offering\n   end-station service.\
    \  This is the Designated RBridge and Appointed\n   Forwarder mechanism initially\
    \ specified in the TRILL base protocol\n   [RFC6325], discussed in Section 2.5\
    \ below, and further specified in\n   both Section 4 below and [RFC6439].\n"
- title: 2.3.  Zero or Minimal Configuration
  contents:
  - "2.3.  Zero or Minimal Configuration\n   TRILL provides connectivity and least-cost\
    \ paths with zero\n   configuration.  For additional services, it strives to require\
    \ only\n   minimal configuration; however, services that require configuration\n\
    \   when offered by [802.1Q] bridges, such as non-default VLANs or\n   priority,\
    \ will require configuration.  This differs from Layer 3\n   routing where routers\
    \ typically need to be configured as to the\n   subnetworks connected to each\
    \ port, etc., to provide service.\n"
- title: 2.4.  MTU Robustness
  contents:
  - "2.4.  MTU Robustness\n   TRILL IS-IS needs to be robust against links with reasonably\n\
    \   restricted MTUs, including links that accommodate only the classic\n   Ethernet\
    \ frame size, despite the addition of reasonable headers such\n   as VLAN tags.\
    \  Such robustness is particularly required for TRILL\n   Hellos to assure correct\
    \ adjacency and the election of a unique DRB\n   on LAN links.\n   TRILL will\
    \ also be used inside data centers where it is common for\n   all or most of the\
    \ links and switches to support frames substantially\n   larger than the classic\
    \ Ethernet maximum size.  For example, they may\n   have an MTU adequate to comfortably\
    \ handle Fiber Channel over\n   Ethernet frames, for which T11 recommends a 2,500-byte\
    \ MTU [FCoE], or\n   even 9K byte jumbo frames.  It would be beneficial for a\
    \ TRILL campus\n   with such a large MTU to be able to safely make use of it.\n\
    \   These needs are met by a mandatory maximum on the size of TRILL\n   Hellos\
    \ and by the optional use of MTU testing as described below.\n"
- title: 2.5.  Purposes of the TRILL Hello Protocol
  contents:
  - "2.5.  Purposes of the TRILL Hello Protocol\n   There are three purposes for the\
    \ TRILL Hello protocol.  They are\n   listed below, along with a reference to\
    \ the section of this document\n   in which each is discussed:\n   1. To determine\
    \ which RBridge neighbors have acceptable connectivity\n      to be reported as\
    \ part of the topology (Section 3)\n   2. To elect a unique Designated RBridge\
    \ on broadcast (LAN) links\n      (Section 4)\n   3. To determine the MTU with\
    \ which it is possible to safely\n      communicate with each RBridge neighbor\
    \ (Section 5)\n   In Layer 3 IS-IS, all three of these functions are combined.\
    \  Hellos\n   may be padded to the maximum length (see [RFC3719], Section 6) so\n\
    \   that a router neighbor is not discovered if it is impossible to\n   communicate\
    \ with it using maximum-sized Layer 3 IS-IS packets.  Also,\n   even if Hellos\
    \ from a neighbor R2 are received by R1, if connectivity\n   to R2 is not 2-way\
    \ (i.e., R2 does not list R1 in R2's Hello), then R1\n   does not consider R2\
    \ as a Designated Intermediate System (Designated\n   Router) candidate.  Because\
    \ of this logic, it is possible at Layer 3\n   for multiple Designated Routers\
    \ to be elected on a LAN, with each\n   representing the LAN as a pseudonode.\
    \  It appears to the topology as\n   if the LAN is now two or more separate LANs.\
    \  Although this is\n   surprising, this does not cause problems for Layer 3.\n\
    \   In contrast, this behavior is not acceptable for TRILL, since in\n   TRILL\
    \ it is important that all RBridges on a link know about each\n   other, and on\
    \ broadcast (LAN) links that they choose a single RBridge\n   to be the DRB to\
    \ control the native frame ingress and egress.\n   Otherwise, multiple RBridges\
    \ might ingress/egress the same native\n   frame, forming loops that are not protected\
    \ by the hop count in the\n   TRILL Header as discussed above.\n   The TRILL Hello\
    \ protocol is best understood by focusing separately on\n   each of these three\
    \ functions listed above, which we do in\n   Sections 3, 4, and 5.\n   One other\
    \ issue with TRILL LAN Hellos is to ensure that subsets of\n   the information\
    \ can appear in any single message, and be processable,\n   in the spirit of IS-IS\
    \ Link State PDUs (LSPs) and Complete Sequence\n   Number PDUs (CSNPs).  LAN TRILL\
    \ Hello packets, even though they are\n   not padded, can become very large. \
    \ An example where this might be\n   the case is when some sort of backbone technology\
    \ interconnects\n   hundreds of TRILL sites over what would appear to TRILL to\
    \ be a giant\n   Ethernet, where the RBridges connected to that cloud will perceive\n\
    \   that backbone to be a single link with hundreds of neighbors.  Thus,\n   the\
    \ TRILL LAN Hello uses a different Neighbor TLV [RFC7176] that\n   lists neighbors\
    \ seen for a range of MAC (SNPA) addresses.\n"
- title: 3.  Adjacency State Machinery
  contents:
  - "3.  Adjacency State Machinery\n   Each RBridge port has associated with it a\
    \ port state, as discussed\n   in Section 4, and a table of zero or more adjacencies\
    \ (if the port is\n   configured as point-to-point, zero, or one) as discussed\
    \ in this\n   section.  The states such adjacencies can have, the events that\
    \ cause\n   adjacency state changes, the actions associated with those state\n\
    \   changes, a state table, and a state diagram are given below.\n"
- title: 3.1.  TRILL Hellos, Ports, and VLANs
  contents:
  - "3.1.  TRILL Hellos, Ports, and VLANs\n   The determination of adjacencies on\
    \ links is made using TRILL Hellos\n   (see Section 8), an optional MTU test (see\
    \ Section 5), and,\n   optionally, BFD (see Section 6) and/or other connectivity\
    \ tests.  If\n   the MAC (SNPA) addresses of more than one RBridge port on a broadcast\n\
    \   link are the same, all but one of such ports are put in the Suspended\n  \
    \ state (see Section 4) and do not participate in the link, except to\n   monitor\
    \ whether they should stay suspended.  If the two ports on a\n   point-to-point\
    \ link have MAC (SNPA) addresses, it does not affect\n   TRILL operation if they\
    \ are the same.  (PPP ports, for example, do\n   not have MAC addresses [RFC6361].)\n\
    \   The following items MUST be the same for all TRILL Hellos issued by\n   an\
    \ RBridge on a particular Ethernet port, regardless of the VLAN in\n   which the\
    \ Hello is sent:\n   - Source MAC address,\n   - Priority to be the DRB,\n   -\
    \ Desired Designated VLAN,\n   - Port ID, and,\n   - if included, BFD-Enabled\
    \ TLV [RFC6213] and PORT-TRILL-VER\n     sub-TLV [RFC7176].\n   Of course, the\
    \ priority, Desired Designated VLAN, and possibly the\n   inclusion or value of\
    \ the PORT-TRILL-VER sub-TLV, and/or BFD-Enabled\n   TLV can change on occasion,\
    \ but then the new value(s) must similarly\n   be used in all TRILL Hellos on\
    \ the LAN port, regardless of VLAN.\n   On broadcast links:\n      Because bridges\
    \ acting as glue on an Ethernet broadcast link might\n      be configured in such\
    \ a way that some VLANs are partitioned, it is\n      necessary for RBridges to\
    \ transmit Hellos on Ethernet links with\n      multiple VLAN tags.  The conceptually\
    \ simplest solution may have\n      been to have RBridges transmit up to 4,094\
    \ times as many Hellos,\n      one with each legal VLAN ID enabled at each port,\
    \ but this would\n      obviously have deleterious performance implications. \
    \ So, the\n      TRILL protocol specifies that if RB1 knows it is not the DRB,\
    \ it\n      transmits its Hellos on only a limited set of VLANs.  Only an\n  \
    \    RBridge that believes itself to be the DRB on a broadcast Ethernet\n    \
    \  link \"sprays\" its TRILL Hellos on all of its enabled VLANs at the\n     \
    \ port.  And in both cases, an RBridge can be configured to send\n      Hellos\
    \ on only a subset of those VLANs.  The details are given in\n      [RFC6325],\
    \ Section 4.4.3.\n   On point-to-point links:\n      If the link technology is\

  - "3.2.  Adjacency Table Entries and States\n   Every adjacency is in one of four\
    \ states, whether it is one of the\n   adjacencies on a broadcast link or the\
    \ one possible adjacency on a\n   point-to-point link.  An RBridge participates\
    \ in LSP synchronization\n   at a port as long as it has one or more adjacencies\
    \ out of that port\n   that are in the 2-Way or Report state.\n   Down: This is\
    \ a virtual state for convenience in creating state\n      diagrams and tables.\
    \  It indicates that the adjacency is\n      nonexistent, and there is no entry\
    \ in the adjacency table for it.\n   Detect: A neighbor RBridge has been detected\
    \ through receipt of a\n      TRILL Hello, but either 2-way connectivity has not\
    \ been confirmed\n      or the detection was on an Ethernet link in a VLAN other\
    \ than the\n      Designated VLAN.\n   2-Way: 2-way connectivity to the neighbor\
    \ has been found and, if the\n      link is Ethernet, it was found on the Designated\
    \ VLAN, but some\n      enabled test, such as the link MTU meeting the minimum\
    \ campus\n      requirement or BFD confirming link connectivity, has not yet\n\
    \      succeeded.\n   Report: There is 2-way connectivity to the neighbor (on\
    \ the\n      Designated VLAN if an Ethernet link); all enabled tests have\n  \
    \    succeeded, including, if enabled, MTU and/or BFD testing.  This\n      state\
    \ will cause adjacency to be reported in an LSP (with\n      appropriate provision\
    \ for a pseudonode, if any, as described in\n      Section 7).\n   For an adjacency\
    \ in any of the three non-Down states (Detect, 2-Way,\n   or Report), there will\
    \ be an adjacency table entry.  That entry will\n   give the state of the adjacency\
    \ and will also include the information\n   listed below.\n   o  The address,\
    \ if any, of the neighbor, the Port ID, and the System\n      ID in the received\
    \ Hellos.  Together, these three quantities\n      uniquely identify the adjacency\
    \ on a broadcast link.\n   o  One or more Hello holding timers.  For a point-to-point\
    \ adjacency,\n      there is a single Hello holding timer.  For a broadcast LAN\n\
    \      adjacency, there are exactly two Hello holding timers: a\n      Designated\
    \ VLAN holding timer and a non-Designated VLAN holding\n      timer.  Each timer\
    \ consists of a 16-bit unsigned integer number\n      of seconds.\n   o  If the\
    \ adjacency is on a broadcast link, the 7-bit unsigned\n      priority of the\
    \ neighbor to be the DRB.\n   o  The 5 bytes of data from the PORT-TRILL-VER received\
    \ in the most\n      recent TRILL Hello from the neighbor RBridge.\n   o  The\
    \ VLAN that the neighbor RBridge wants to be the Designated VLAN\n      on the\
    \ link, called the Desired Designated VLAN.\n   o  For an adjacency table at an\
    \ RBridge that supports BFD, a flag\n      indicating whether the last received\
    \ TRILL Hello from the neighbor\n      RBridge contained a BFD-Enabled TLV (see\

    \       Designated VLAN.\n       - If received for a broadcast LAN adjacency,\
    \ it contains a TRILL\n         Neighbor TLV that explicitly lists the receiving\

    \ System ID and\n         Extended Circuit ID.\n   A2. Event A2 is not possible\
    \ for a port configured as point-to-point.\n       Receive a TRILL Hello (other\
    \ than an A0 event) such that either\n       - The port is Ethernet and the Hello\
    \ was not on the Designated\n         VLAN (any TRILL Neighbor TLV in such a Hello\
    \ is ignored), or\n       - The Hello does not contain a TRILL Neighbor TLV covering\
    \ an\n         address range that includes the receiver's (SNPA) address.\n  \
    \ A3. Receive a TRILL Hello (other than an A0 event) such that:\n       - If received\
    \ on an Ethernet port, it was received in the\n         Designated VLAN.\n   \
    \    - If received for a broadcast LAN adjacency, it contains one or\n       \

    \       (2) on a broadcast LAN adjacency,\n           (2a) both Hello timers expire\
    \ simultaneously or\n           (2b) one Hello timer expires when the other Hello\
    \ timer is\n                already in the expired state.\n   A5. For a broadcast\
    \ LAN adjacency, the Designated VLAN Hello holding\n       timer expires, but\
    \ the non-Designated VLAN Hello holding timer\n       still has time left until\

    \       connectivity tests were successful but one or more now fail.\n   A8. The\
    \ RBridge port goes operationally down.\n   For the special A0 event, the Hello\
    \ is examined to determine if it\n   has a higher priority than the port on which\
    \ it is received such that\n   the sending port should be the DRB as described\
    \ in Section 4.2.1.  If\n   the Hello is of lower priority than the receiving\
    \ port, it is\n   discarded with no further action.  If it is of higher priority\
    \ than\n   the receiving port, then any adjacencies for the receiving port are\n\
    \   discarded (transitioned to the Down state), and the port is suspended\n  \
    \ as described in Section 4.2.\n   The receipt of a TRILL Hello that is not an\
    \ event A0 causes the\n   following actions (except where the Hello would have\
    \ created a new\n   adjacency table entry but both the adjacency table is full\
    \ and the\n   Hello is too low priority to displace an existing entry as described\n\
    \   in Section 3.6).  The Designated VLAN referred to is the Designated\n   VLAN\
    \ dictated by the DRB determined without taking the received TRILL\n   LAN Hello\
    \ into account (see Section 4) for a broadcast LAN and the\n   local Desired Designated\
    \ VLAN for a port configured as point-to-\n   point.\n   o  If the receipt of\

    \ (SNPA) address (if any), Port ID, and System\n      ID are set from the Hello.\n\
    \   o  For a point-to-point adjacency, the Hello holding timer is set\n      from\
    \ the Holding Time field of the Hello.  For a broadcast link\n      adjacency,\
    \ the appropriate Hello holding timer for that adjacency,\n      depending on\
    \ whether or not the Hello was received in the\n      Designated VLAN, is set\
    \ to the Holding Time field of the Hello and\n      if the receipt of the LAN\
    \ Hello is creating a new adjacency table\n      entry, the other timer is set\
    \ to expired.\n   o  For a broadcast link adjacency, the priority of the neighbor\n\
    \      RBridge to be the DRB is set to the priority field of the LAN\n      Hello.\n\
    \   o  For a broadcast link adjacency, the VLAN that the neighbor RBridge\n  \
    \    wants to be the Designated VLAN on the link is set from the Hello.\n   o\
    \  The 5 bytes of PORT-TRILL-VER data are set from that sub-TLV in\n      the\
    \ Hello or set to zero if that sub-TLV does not occur in the\n      Hello.\n \
    \  o  For a broadcast link, if the creation of a new adjacency table\n      entry\
    \ or the priority update above changes the results of the DRB\n      election\
    \ on the link, the appropriate RBridge port event (D2 or\n      D3) occurs, after\
    \ the above actions, as described in Section 4.2.\n   o  For a broadcast link\
    \ adjacency, if there is no change in the DRB,\n      but the neighbor Hello is\
    \ from the DRB and has a changed\n      Designated VLAN from the previous Hello\
    \ received from the DRB, the\n      result is a change in Designated VLAN for\
    \ the link as specified in\n      Section 4.2.3.\n   An event A4 resulting in\
    \ the adjacency transitioning to the Down\n   state may also result in an event\
    \ D3 as described in Section 4.2.\n   Concerning events A6 and A7, if none of\
    \ MTU, BFD, or other testing is\n   enabled, A6 is considered to occur immediately\

    \ on the port in an adjacency state\n   other than the Down state.  The winner\
    \ is the RBridge with highest\n   priority to be the DRB, as determined from the\

    \ priority to be\n   the DRB field, with MAC (SNPA) address as a tiebreaker, Port\

- title: 5.  MTU Matching
  contents:
  - "5.  MTU Matching\n   The purpose of MTU testing is to ensure that the links used\
    \ in the\n   campus topology can pass TRILL IS-IS packets, particularly LSP PDUs,\n\
    \   at the TRILL campus MTU.  The LSP PDUs generated at a TRILL switch\n   could,\
    \ as part of the flooding process, be sent over any adjacency in\n   the campus.\
    \  To assure correct operation of IS-IS, an LSP PDU must be\n   able to reach\
    \ every RBridge in the IS-IS reachable campus; this might\n   be impossible if\
    \ the PDU exceeded the MTU of an adjacency that was\n   part of the campus topology.\n\
    \   An RBridge, RB1, determines the desired campus link MTU by\n   calculating\
    \ the minimum of its originatingL1LSPBufferSize and the\n   originatingL1LSPBufferSize\
    \ of other RBridges in the campus, as\n   advertised in the link-state database,\
    \ but not less than 1,470 bytes.\n   Although originatingL1LSPBufferSize in Layer\
    \ 3 [IS-IS] is limited to\n   the range 512 to 1,492 bytes inclusive, in TRILL\
    \ it is limited to the\n   range 1,470 to 65,535 bytes inclusive.  (See Section\
    \ 5 of [RFC7180].)\n   Although MTU testing is optional, it is mandatory for an\
    \ RBridge to\n   respond to an MTU-probe PDU with an MTU-ack PDU [RFC6325] [RFC7176].\n\
    \   The use of multicast or unicast for MTU-probe and MTU-ack is an\n   implementation\
    \ choice.  However, the burden on the link is generally\n   minimized by the following:\
    \ (1) multicasting MTU-probes when a\n   response from all other RBridges on the\
    \ link is desired, such as when\n   initializing or reconfirming MTU, (2) unicasting\
    \ MTU-probes when a\n   response from a single RBridge is desired, such as one\
    \ that has just\n   been detected on the link, and (3) unicasting all MTU-ack\
    \ packets.\n   RB1 can test the MTU size to RB2 as described in Section 4.3.2\
    \ of\n   [RFC6325].  For this purpose, MTU testing is only done in the\n   Designated\
    \ VLAN.  An adjacency that fails the MTU test at the campus\n   MTU will not enter\
    \ the Report state, or, if the adjacency is in that\n   state, it leaves that\
    \ state.  Thus, an adjacency failing the MTU test\n   at the campus minimum MTU\
    \ will not be reported by the RBridge\n   performing the test.  Since inclusion\
    \ in least-cost route computation\n   requires the adjacency to be reported by\
    \ both ends, as long as the\n   RBridge at either end of the adjacency notices\
    \ the MTU failure, it\n   will not be so used.\n   If RB1 tests MTU size, it reports\
    \ the largest size for which the MTU\n   test succeeds or a flag indicating that\
    \ it fails at the campus MTU.\n   This report always appears with the neighbor\
    \ in RB1's TRILL Neighbor\n   TLV.  RB1 MAY also report this with the adjacency\
    \ in an Extended\n   Reachability TLV in RB1's LSP.  RB1 MAY choose to test MTU\
    \ sizes\n   greater than the desired campus MTU as well as the desired\n   campus\
    \ MTU.\n   Most types of TRILL IS-IS packets, such as LSPs, can make use of the\n\
    \   campus MTU.  The exceptions are TRILL Hellos, which must be kept\n   small\
    \ for loop safety, and the MTU PDUs, whose size must be adjusted\n   appropriately\
    \ for the tests being performed.\n"

  contents:
  - "6.  BFD-Enabled TLV and BFD Session Bootstrapping\n   When the adjacency between\
    \ RBridges reaches the 2-Way state, TRILL\n   Hellos will already have been exchanged.\
    \  If an RBridge supports BFD\n   [RFC7175], it will have learned whether the\
    \ other RBridge has BFD\n   enabled by whether or not a BFD-Enabled TLV [RFC6213]\

    \ of the\n   sending RBridge [RFC7176] so that information will be available to\n\
    \   the receiving RBridge.\n   The BFD-Enabled TLVs in TRILL Hellos will look\

    \ Example/Format\n         Type = 148 for BFD Enabled [RFC6213].\n         Length\
    \ will be 3 times the number of topology and protocol\n         pairs in the TLV.\n\
    \         MT ID is a topology ID [RFC5120] that will be zero unless\n        \
    \ multi-topology is being supported [MT].\n         NLPID is a Network Layer Protocol\
    \ ID [RFC6328] and will be 0xC0\n         for TRILL, but additional topology and\
    \ protocol pairs could\n         conceivably be listed.\n   An RBridge port initiates\
    \ a one-hop BFD session with another RBridge\n   if the following conditions are\
    \ met: (1) it has BFD enabled, (2) it\n   has an adjacency to another RBridge\
    \ in the 2-Way or Report state, and\n   (3) the Hellos it receives indicate that\
    \ the other RBridge also has\n   BFD enabled.  Either (a) BFD was enabled on both\
    \ RBridge ports when\n   the adjacency changed to the 2-Way or Report state, (b)\
    \ the adjacency\n   was already in the 2-Way or Report state and BFD was enabled\
    \ on one\n   RBridge port when BFD had been enabled on the other, or (c) BFD was\n\
    \   simultaneously enabled on both RBridge ports.\n   In such a BFD session, BFD\
    \ is encapsulated as specified in [RFC7175].\n   The egress nickname to be used\
    \ will have been learned from received\n   Hellos.  On a point-to-point link,\
    \ the Any-RBridge nickname [RFC7180]\n   can also be used as egress, since support\
    \ of that nickname is\n   required by support of RBridge Channel [RFC7178] and\
    \ support of\n   RBridge Channel is required for support of BFD over TRILL.\n\
    \   The rare case of transient nickname conflict (due to the network\n   operator\
    \ configuring a conflict, new connectivity to a previously\n   isolated RBridge,\
    \ or the like) can cause transient failure of an\n   ongoing BFD session.  This\
    \ can be avoided in the one-hop point-to-\n   point case by using the Any-RBridge\
    \ egress nickname.  In cases where\n   Any-RBridge cannot be used as the egress\
    \ nickname and a transient\n   nickname conflict is detected for the intended\
    \ destination of a BFD\n   session, initiation of the session SHOULD be delayed\
    \ until the\n   conflict is resolved.\n   If a one-hop BFD session is initiated\
    \ when the adjacency is in the\n   2-Way state, the adjacency MUST NOT advance\
    \ to the Report state until\n   BFD and any other enabled connectivity tests (including\
    \ MTU, if\n   enabled) have succeeded, as specified in Section 3.\n   If a one-hop\
    \ BFD session is established when the adjacency is in the\n   Report state, due\
    \ to enablement at the RBridges, then, to minimize\n   unnecessary topology changes,\
    \ the adjacency MUST remain in the Report\n   state unless and until the BFD session\
    \ (or some other enabled\n   connectivity test) fails.\n"

    \ sets the bypass pseudonode bit in its TRILL LAN Hellos,\n   the RBridges on\
    \ the link (including the DRB) just directly report all\n   their adjacencies\
    \ on the LAN that are in the Report state.  If the\n   DRB does not set the bypass\
    \ pseudonode bit in its TRILL Hellos, then\n   (1) the DRB reports in its LSP\
    \ its adjacency to the pseudonode, (2)\n   the DRB sends LSPs on behalf of the\
    \ pseudonode in which it reports\n   adjacency to all other RBridges on the link\
    \ where it sees that\n   adjacency in the Report state, and (3) all other RBridges\
    \ on the link\n   report their adjacency to the pseudonode if they see their adjacency\n\
    \   to the DRB as being in the Report state and do not report any other\n   adjacencies\
    \ on the link.  Setting the bypass pseudonode bit has no\n   effect on how LSPs\
    \ are flooded on a link.  It only affects what LSPs\n   are generated.\n   It\
    \ is anticipated that many links between RBridges will actually be\n   point-to-point\
    \ even in cases where the link technology supports\n   operation as a multi-access\
    \ broadcast link, in which case using a\n   pseudonode merely adds to the complexity.\
    \  For example, if RB1 and\n   RB2 are the only RBridges on the link, and RB1\
    \ is the DRB, then if\n   RB1 creates a pseudonode -- for example, RB1.25 -- that\
    \ is used,\n   there are then 3 LSPs: RB1.25, RB1, and RB2, where RB1.25 reports\n\
    \   connectivity to RB1 and RB2, and RB1 and RB2 each just say they are\n   connected\
    \ to RB1.25.  However, if DRB RB1 sets the bypass pseudonode\n   bit in its Hellos,\
    \ then there will be only 2 LSPs: RB1 and RB2, each\n   reporting connectivity\
    \ to each other.\n   A DRB SHOULD set the bypass pseudonode bit in its Hellos\
    \ if it has\n   not seen at least two simultaneous adjacencies in the Report state\n\
    \   since it last rebooted or was reset by network management.\n"

  - "8.2.1.  TRILL Neighbor TLVs\n   A TRILL Neighbor TLV SHOULD NOT be included in\
    \ TRILL point-to-point\n   Hellos, as it MUST be ignored in that context and wastes\
    \ space.\n   TRILL Neighbor TLVs sent in a LAN Hello on an Ethernet link MUST\
    \ show\n   the neighbor information, as sensed by the transmitting RBridge, for\n\
    \   the VLAN on which the Hello is sent.  Since implementations\n   conformant\
    \ to this document maintain such information on a per-VLAN\n   basis only for\
    \ the Designated VLAN, such implementations only send\n   the TRILL Neighbor TLV\
    \ in TRILL LAN Hellos in the Designated VLAN.\n   It is RECOMMENDED that, if there\
    \ is sufficient room, a TRILL Neighbor\n   TLV or TLVs, as described in Section\
    \ 4.4.2.1 of [RFC6325], covering\n   the entire range of MAC addresses and listing\
    \ all adjacencies with a\n   non-zero Designated VLAN Hello Holding Time, or an\
    \ empty list of\n   neighbors if there are no such adjacencies, be in TRILL Hellos\
    \ sent\n   on the Designated VLAN.  If this is not possible, then TRILL Neighbor\n\
    \   TLVs covering sub-ranges of MAC addresses should be sent so that the\n   entire\
    \ range is covered reasonably promptly.  Delays in sending TRILL\n   Neighbor\
    \ TLVs will delay the advancement of adjacencies to the Report\n   state and the\
    \ discovery of some link failures.  Rapid (for example,\n   sub-second) detection\
    \ of link or node failures is best addressed with\n   a protocol designed for\
    \ that purpose, such as BFD (see Section 6).\n   To ensure that any RBridge RB2\
    \ can definitively determine whether RB1\n   can hear RB2, RB1's neighbor list\
    \ MUST eventually cover every\n   possible range of IDs, that is, within a period\
    \ that depends on RB1's\n   policy and not necessarily within any specific period\
    \ such as its\n   Holding Time.  In other words, if X1 is the smallest ID reported\
    \ in\n   one of RB1's neighbor lists, and the \"smallest\" flag is not set, then\n\
    \   X1 MUST appear in a different neighbor list as well, as the largest\n   ID\
    \ reported in that fragment.  Or lists may overlap, as long as there\n   is no\
    \ gap, such that some range, say, between Xi and Xj, would never\n   appear in\
    \ any list.\n"

    \   destination multicast address or is so marked by the appropriate code\n  \
    \ point on other link types such as PPP [RFC6361] or a pseudowire\n   [RFC7173]\
    \ -- it will be examined to see if it appears to be an IS-IS\n   PDU.  If so,\
    \ and it appears to be a TRILL Hello PDU, the following\n   tests are performed:\n\
    \   o  The type of Hello PDU (LAN or P2P) is compared with the port\n      configuration.\
    \  If a LAN Hello is received on a port configured to\n      be point-to-point\
    \ or a P2P Hello is received on a port not\n      configured to be point-to-point,\
    \ it is discarded.\n   o  If the Circuit Type field is not 1, the PDU is discarded.\n\
    \   o  If the PDU does not contain an Area Address TLV or it contains an\n   \
    \   Area Address TLV that is not the single Area Address zero, it is\n      discarded.\n\
    \   o  If the Hello includes a Protocols Supported TLV that does not list\n  \
    \    the TRILL NLPID (0xC0), it is discarded.  It is acceptable if\n      there\
    \ is no Protocols Supported TLV present.\n   o  If the Hello does not contain\
    \ an MT Port Capabilities TLV\n      containing a VLAN-FLAGS sub-TLV [RFC7176],\
    \ it is discarded.\n   o  If the maximumAreaAddresses field of the PDU is not\
    \ 1, it is\n      discarded.\n   o  If IS-IS authentication is in use on the link\
    \ and either the PDU\n      has no Authentication TLV or validation of the PDU's\n\
    \      Authentication TLV fails, it is discarded.\n   If none of the rules in\
    \ the list above cause the packet to be\n   discarded and the packet is parseable,\
    \ it is assumed to be a\n   well-formed TRILL Hello received on the link.  It\

  contents:
  - "9.  Multiple Ports on the Same Broadcast Link\n   It is possible for an RBridge\
    \ RB1 to have multiple ports on the same\n   broadcast (LAN) link that are not\
    \ in the Suspended state.  It is\n   important for RB1 to recognize which of its\
    \ ports are on the same\n   link.  RB1 can detect this condition based on receiving\
    \ TRILL Hello\n   messages with the same LAN ID on multiple ports.\n   The DRB\
    \ election is port-based (see Section 4), and only the Hellos\n   from the elected\
    \ port can perform certain functions such as dictating\n   the Designated VLAN\
    \ or whether a pseudonode will be used; however,\n   the election also designates\
    \ the RBridge with that port as the DRB\n   for the link.  An RBridge may choose\
    \ to load split some tasks among\n   its ports on the link if it has more than\
    \ one.  Section 4.4.4 of\n   [RFC6325] describes when it is safe to do so.\n"
