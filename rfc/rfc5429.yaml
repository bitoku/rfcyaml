- title: 1.  Introduction

  - "1.  Introduction\n   The Sieve mail filtering language, as originally defined\
    \ in RFC 3028\n   [RFC3028], specified that the \"reject\" action shall discard\
    \ a message\n   and send a Message Disposition Notification [MDN] to the envelope\n\
    \   sender along with an explanatory message.  The Sieve mail filtering\n   language,\
    \ as updated in RFC 5228 [SIEVE], does not define any\n   \"reject\" action, hence\
    \ that is the purpose of this document.\n   This document updates the definition\
    \ of the \"reject\" action to permit\n   refusal of the message during the SMTP\
    \ transaction, if possible, and\n   defines a new \"ereject\" action to require\
    \ refusal of the message\n   during the SMTP transaction, if possible.\n   An\
    \ important goal of this document is to reduce the risk of Sieve\n   scripts being\
    \ used to perpetrate \"Joe-job\" spam runs, where the MDN\n   is sent notifying\
    \ the sender of a message of its non-delivery is in\n   fact sent to an innocent\
    \ third-party.  The original Sieve \"reject\"\n   action defined in RFC 3028 required\
    \ use of MDNs for rejecting\n   messages, thus contributing to the flood of Joe-job\
    \ spam to victims\n   of Joe-jobs.  By rejecting the message at the protocol level,\
    \ it is\n   less likely that an MDN will be needed, and thus less likely that\
    \ an\n   MDN will be misdirected at an innocent third-party.\n   Implementations\
    \ are further encouraged to use spam-detection systems\n   to determine the level\
    \ of risk associated with sending an MDN, and\n   this document allows implementations\
    \ to silently drop the MDN if the\n   rejected message is deemed likely to be\
    \ spam.\n   This document also describes how to use \"reject\"/\"ereject\" at\
    \ varying\n   points in the email stack: Mail Transfer Agent (MTA), Mail Delivery\n\
    \   Agent (MDA), and Mail User Agent (MUA).  See [EMAIL-ARCH] for a\n   comprehensive\
    \ discussion of these environments.\n   In general, an MDN is generated by an\
    \ MUA, and can be used to\n   indicate the status of a message with respect to\
    \ its recipient, while\n   a Delivery Status Notification (DSN) [DSN] is generated\
    \ by an MTA,\n   and can be used to indicate whether or not a message was received\
    \ and\n   delivered by the mail system.\n   Further discussion highlighting the\
    \ risks of generating MDNs and the\n   benefits of protocol-level refusal can\
    \ be found in [Joe-DoS].\n"

  contents:
  - "2.1.  Action ereject\n   Usage: ereject <reason: string>\n   Sieve implementations\
    \ that implement the \"ereject\" action must use\n   the \"ereject\" capability\
    \ string.\n   The \"ereject\" action cancels the implicit keep and refuses delivery\n\
    \   of a message.  The \"reason\" string is a UTF-8 [UTF-8] string\n   specifying\
    \ the reason for refusal.  How a message is refused depends\n   on the capabilities\
    \ of the mail component (MDA or MTA) executing the\n   Sieve script.  The Sieve\
    \ interpreter MUST carry out one of the\n   following actions (listed in order\
    \ from most to least preferred),\n   MUST carry out the most preferable action\
    \ possible, and MUST fall\n   back to lesser actions if a preferred action fails.\n\
    \   1.  Refuse message delivery by sending a 5XX response code over SMTP\n   \
    \    [SMTP] or Local Mail Transfer Protocol (LMTP) [LMTP].  See\n       Section\
    \ 2.1.1 for more details.\n   2.  Send a non-delivery report to the envelope sender\
    \ ([REPORT]\n       [DSN]), unless the envelope sender address is determined to\
    \ be a\n       forged or otherwise invalid address.\n   Note that the determination\
    \ of whether or not an envelope sender is a\n   forgery may be performed by site-specific\
    \ and implementation-specific\n   heuristic techniques, such as \"return-path\
    \ verification\", details of\n   which are outside the scope of this document.\
    \  Implementations SHOULD\n   log instances when a non-delivery report is not\
    \ sent and the reason\n   for not sending the report (e.g., content was spam,\
    \ return-path\n   invalid, etc.).\n   The \"ereject\" action MUST NOT be available\
    \ in environments that do\n   not support protocol-level rejection, e.g., an MUA,\
    \ and MUST be\n   available in all other environments that support the \"reject\"\
    \ action.\n       Example:\n               require [\"ereject\"];\n          \
    \     if address \"from\" \"someone@example.com\" {\n                   ereject\
    \ \"I no longer accept mail from this address\";\n               }\n"

  contents:
  - "2.1.1.  Rejecting a Message at the SMTP/LMTP Protocol Level\n   Sieve implementations\
    \ that are able to reject messages at the SMTP/\n   LMTP level MUST do so and\
    \ SHOULD use the 550 response code.  Note\n   that if a message is arriving over\
    \ SMTP and has multiple recipients,\n   some of whom have accepted the message,\
    \ Section 2.1.2 defines how to\n   reject such a message.\n   The risk that these\
    \ actions will generate blowback spam are minimized\n   but cannot be eliminated\
    \ completely even in the case of \"ereject\", so\n   caution is advised when using\
    \ these actions to deal with messages\n   determined to be spam.\n   Note that\
    \ SMTP [SMTP] does not allow non-US-ACSII characters in the\n   SMTP response\
    \ text.  If non-US-ACSII characters appear in the\n   \"reason\" string, they\
    \ can be sent at the protocol level if and only\n   if the client and the server\
    \ use an SMTP extension that allows for\n   transmission of non-US-ACSII reply\
    \ text.  (One example of such an\n   SMTP extension is described in [UTF8-RESP].)\
    \  In the absence of such\n   an SMTP extension, the Sieve engine MUST replace\
    \ any \"reason\" string\n   being sent at the protocol level and containing non-US-ACSII\n\
    \   characters with an implementation-defined US-ACSII-only string.\n   Users\
    \ who don't like this behavior should consider using the \"reject\"\n   action\
    \ described in Section 2.2, if available.\n   See Section 2.5 for the detailed\
    \ instructions about performing\n   protocol-level rejection.\n"
- title: 2.1.2.  Rejecting a Message by Sending a DSN
  contents:
  - "2.1.2.  Rejecting a Message by Sending a DSN\n   An implementation may receive\
    \ a message via SMTP that has more than\n   one RCPT TO that has been accepted\
    \ by the server, and at least one\n   but not all of them are refusing delivery\
    \ (whether the refusal is\n   caused by a Sieve \"ereject\" action or for some\
    \ other reason).  In\n   this case, the server MUST accept the message and generate\
    \ DSNs for\n   all recipients that are refusing it.  Note that this exception\
    \ does\n   not apply to LMTP, as LMTP is able to reject messages on a per-\n \
    \  recipient basis.  (However, the LMTP client may then have no choice\n   but\
    \ to generate a DSN to report the error, which may result in\n   blowback spam.)\n\

    \ in this section can be replaced\n   with the \"ereject\" action.\n   A \"reject\"\
    \ action cancels the implicit keep.\n   Implementations MUST prohibit the execution\
    \ of more than one \"reject\"\n   in a Sieve script.\n   \"reject\" MUST be incompatible\
    \ with the \"vacation\" [VACATION] action.\n   It is NOT RECOMMENDED that implementations\
    \ permit the use of \"reject\"\n   with actions that cause mail delivery, such\
    \ as \"keep\", \"fileinto\",\n   and \"redirect\".\n   Making \"reject\" compatible\
    \ with actions that cause mail delivery\n   violates the RFC 5321 [SMTP] principle\
    \ that a message is either\n   delivered or bounced back to the sender.  So bouncing\
    \ a message back\n   (rejecting) and delivering it will make the sender believe\
    \ that the\n   message was not delivered.\n   However, there are existing laws\
    \ requiring certain organizations to\n   archive all received messages, even the\
    \ rejected ones.  Also, it can\n   be quite useful to save copies of rejected\
    \ messages for later\n   analysis.\n   Any action that would modify the message\
    \ body will not have an effect\n   on the body of any message refused by \"reject\"\
    \ using an SMTP response\n   code and MUST NOT have any effect on the content\

  - "3.  Changes from RFC 3028\n   Clarified that the \"reject\" action cancels the\
    \ implicit keep.\n   Extended the list of allowable actions on \"reject\" to include\n\
    \   protocol-level message rejection.\n   Added the \"ereject\" action that is\
    \ similar to \"reject\", but will\n   always favor protocol-level message rejection.\n"
- title: 4.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "4.  Security Considerations\n   The introduction to this document discusses why\
    \ rejecting messages\n   before delivery is better than accepting and bouncing\
    \ them.\n   While the details of techniques that can be used to determine when\
    \ to\n   silently drop a non-delivery report are outside the scope of this\n \
    \  document, the explicit permission this document gives to take such\n   action\
    \ may enable denial-of-service situations.  Techniques such as\n   spam-checking,\
    \ return-path verification, and others, can and do have\n   false-positives. \
    \ Care should be exercised to prevent the loss of\n   legitimate messages by failing\
    \ to notify the sender of non-delivery.\n   Security issues associated with email\
    \ auto-responders are fully\n   discussed in the Security Considerations section\
    \ of [RFC3834].  This\n   document is not believed to introduce any additional\
    \ security\n   considerations in this general area.\n   The \"ereject\" extension\
    \ does not raise any other security\n   considerations that are not already present\
    \ in the base [SIEVE]\n   specification, and these issues are discussed in [SIEVE].\n"
