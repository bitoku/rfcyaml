    \ Voice Messaging (IVM) concept described in this document\n   is not a successor\
    \ format to VPIM v2 (Voice Profile for Internet Mail\n   Version 2), but rather\
    \ an alternative specification for a different\n   application.\n"
- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   For some forms of communication, people prefer to communicate\
    \ using\n   their voices rather than typing.  By permitting voicemail to be\n\
    \   implemented in an interoperable way on top of Internet Mail, voice\n   messaging\
    \ and electronic mail no longer need to remain in separate,\n   isolated worlds,\
    \ and users will be able to choose the most\n   appropriate form of communication.\
    \  This will also enable new types\n   of devices, without keyboards, to be used\
    \ to participate in\n   electronic messaging when mobile, in a hostile environment,\
    \ or in\n   spite of disabilities.\n   There exist unified messaging systems that\
    \ will transmit voicemail\n   messages over the Internet using SMTP/MIME, but\
    \ these systems suffer\n   from a lack of interoperability because various aspects\
    \ of such a\n   message have not hitherto been standardized.  In addition, voicemail\n\
    \   systems can now conform to the Voice Profile for Internet Messaging\n   (VPIM\
    \ v2 as defined in RFC 2421 [VPIMV2] and revised in RFC 3801,\n   Draft Standard\
    \ [VPIMV2R2]) when forwarding messages to remote\n   voicemail systems.  VPIM\
    \ v2 was designed to allow two voicemail\n   systems to exchange messages, not\
    \ to allow a voicemail system to\n   interoperate with a desktop e-mail client.\
    \  It is often not\n   reasonable to expect a VPIM v2 message to be usable by\
    \ an e-mail\n   recipient.  The result is messages that cannot be processed by\
    \ the\n   recipient (e.g., because of the encoding used), or look ugly to the\n\
    \   user.\n   This document therefore proposes a standard mechanism for\n   representing\
    \ a voicemail message within SMTP/MIME, and a standard\n   encoding for the audio\
    \ content, which unified messaging systems and\n   mail clients MUST implement\
    \ to ensure interoperability.  By using a\n   standard SMTP/MIME representation\
    \ and a widely implemented audio\n   encoding, this will also permit most users\
    \ of e-mail clients not\n   specifically implementing the standard to still access\
    \ the voicemail\n   messages.  In addition, this document describes features an\
    \ e-mail\n   client SHOULD implement to allow recipients to display voicemail\n\
    \   messages in a more friendly, context-sensitive way to the user, and\n   intelligently\
    \ provide some of the additional functionality typically\n   found in voicemail\
    \ systems (such as responding with a voice message\n   instead of e-mail).  Finally,\
    \ how a client MAY provide a level of\n   interoperability with VPIM v2 is explained.\n\
    \   It is desirable that unified messaging mail clients also be able to\n   fully\
    \ interoperate with voicemail servers.  This is possible today,\n   providing\
    \ the client implements VPIM v2 [VPIMV2R2], in addition to\n   this specification,\
    \ and uses it to construct messages to be sent to a\n   voicemail server.\n  \
    \ The definition in this document is based on the IVM Requirements\n   document\
    \ [GOALS].  It references separate work on critical content\n   [CRITICAL] and\
    \ message context [HINT].  Addressing and directory\n   issues are discussed in\
    \ related documents [ADDRESS], [VPIMENUM],\n   [SCHEMA].\n   Further information\
    \ on VPIM and related activities can be found at\n   http://www.vpim.org or http://www.ema.org/vpim.\n"

- title: 3.  Message Format
  contents:
  - "3.  Message Format\n   Voice messages may be created explicitly by a user (e.g.,\
    \ recording a\n   voicemail message in their mail client) or implicitly by a unified\n\
    \   messaging system (when it records a telephone message).\n   All messages MUST\
    \ conform with the Internet Mail format, as updated\n   by the DRUMS working group\
    \ [DRUMSIMF], and the MIME format [MIME1].\n   When creating a voice message from\
    \ a client supporting IVM, the\n   message header MUST indicate a message context\
    \ of \"voice-message\"\n   (see [HINT]).  However, to support interoperability\
    \ with clients not\n   explicitly supporting IVM, a recipient MUST NOT require\
    \ its presence\n   in order to correctly process voice messages.\n   The receiving\
    \ agent MUST be able to support multipart messages\n   [MIME5].  If the receiving\
    \ user agent identifies the message as a\n   voice message (from the message context),\
    \ it SHOULD present it to the\n   user as a voice message rather than as an electronic\
    \ mail message\n   with a voice attachment (see [BEHAVIOUR]).\n   Any content\
    \ type is permitted in a message, but the top level content\n   type on a new,\
    \ forwarded or reply voice message SHOULD be\n   multipart/mixed.  If the recipient\
    \ is known to be VPIM v2 compliant,\n   then multipart/voice-message MAY be used\
    \ instead (in which case, all\n   the provisions of [VPIMV2R2] MUST be implemented\
    \ in constructing the\n   message).\n   If the message was created as a voice\
    \ message, and so is not useful\n   if the audio content is omitted, then the\
    \ appropriate audio body part\n   MUST be indicated as critical content, via a\
    \ Criticality parameter of\n   CRITICAL on the Content-Disposition (see [CRITICAL]).\
    \  Additional\n   important body parts (such as the original audio message if\
    \ a\n   voicemail is being forwarded) MAY also be indicated via a Criticality\n\
    \   of CRITICAL.  Contents that are not essential to communicating the\n   meaning\
    \ of the message (e.g., an associated vCard for the originator)\n   MAY be indicated\
    \ via a Criticality of IGNORE.\n   When forwarding IVM messages, clients MUST\
    \ preserve the content type\n   of all audio body parts in order to ensure that\
    \ the new recipient is\n   able to play the forwarded messages.\n   The top level\
    \ content type, on origination of a delivery notification\n   message, MUST be\
    \ a multipart/report.  This will allow automatic\n   processing of the delivery\
    \ notification, for example, so that text-\n   to-speech processing can render\
    \ a non-delivery notification in the\n   appropriate language for the recipient.\n"
- title: 4.  Transport
  contents:
  - "4.  Transport\n   The message MUST be transmitted in accordance with the Simple\
    \ Mail\n   Transport Protocol, as updated by the DRUMS working group [DRUMSMTP].\n\
    \   Delivery Status Notifications MAY be requested [DSN] if delivery of\n   the\
    \ message is important to the originator and a mechanism exists to\n   return\
    \ status indications to them (which may not be possible for\n   voicemail originators).\n"
- title: 5.  Addressing
  contents:
  - "5.  Addressing\n   Any valid Internet Mail address may be used for a voice message.\n\
    \   It is desirable to be able to use an onramp/offramp for delivery of a\n  \
    \ voicemail message to a user, which will result in specific addressing\n   requirements,\
    \ based on service selectors defined in [SELECTOR].\n   Further discussion of\
    \ addressing requirements for voice messages can\n   be found in the VPIM Addressing\
    \ document [ADDRESS].\n   It is desirable to permit the use of a directory service\
    \ to map\n   between the E.164 phone number of the recipient and an SMTP mailbox\n\
    \   address.  A discussion on how this may be achieved using the ENUM\n   infrastructure\
    \ is in [VPIMENUM].  A definition of the VPIM LDAP\n   schema that a system would\
    \ use is found in [SCHEMA].\n   If a message is created and stored as a result\
    \ of call answering, the\n   caller's name and number MAY be stored in the message\
    \ headers in its\n   original format per [CLID].\n"
- title: 6.  Notifications
  contents:
  - "6.  Notifications\n   Delivery Status Notifications MUST be supported.  All non-delivery\
    \ of\n   messages MUST result in an NDN, if requested [DSN, DSN2, DSN3, DSN4].\n\
    \   If the receiving system supports content criticality and is unable to\n  \
    \ process all of the critical media types within a voice message\n   (indicated\
    \ by the content criticality), then it MUST non-deliver the\n   entire message\
    \ per [CRITICAL].\n   Message Disposition Notifications SHOULD be supported (but\
    \ according\n   to MDN rules, the user MUST be given the option of deciding whether\n\
    \   MDNs are returned) per [MDN].\n   If the recipient is unable to display all\
    \ of the indicated critical\n   content components indicated, then it SHOULD give\
    \ the user the option\n   of returning an appropriate MDN (see [CRITICAL]).\n"
- title: 7.  Voice Contents
  contents:
  - "7.  Voice Contents\n   Voice messages may be contained at any location within\
    \ a message and\n   MUST always be contained in an audio/basic content-type, unless\
    \ the\n   originator is aware that the recipient can handle other content.\n \
    \  Specifically, Audio/32kadpcm MAY be used when the recipient is known\n   to\
    \ support VPIM v2 [VPIMV2R2].\n   The VOICE parameter on Content-Disposition from\
    \ VPIM v2 [VPIMV2R2]\n   SHOULD be used to identify any spoken names or spoken\
    \ subjects (as\n   distinct from voice message contents).  As well, the Content-Duration\n\
    \   header [DUR] SHOULD be used to indicate the audio length.\n   The originator's\
    \ spoken name MAY be included with messages as\n   separate audio contents, if\
    \ known, and SHOULD be indicated by the\n   Content-Disposition VOICE parameter\
    \ as defined in VPIM v2 [VPIMV2R2].\n   If there is a single recipient for the\
    \ message, the spoken name MAY\n   also be included (per VPIM v2).  A spoken subject\
    \ MAY also be\n   provided (per VPIM v2).\n   A sending implementation MAY determine\
    \ the recipient capabilities\n   before sending a message and choose a codec accordingly\
    \ (e.g., using\n   some form of content negotiation).  In the absence of such\
    \ recipient\n   knowledge, sending implementations MUST use raw G.711 mu-law,\
    \ which\n   is indicated with a MIME content type of \"audio/basic\" (and SHOULD\n\
    \   use a filename parameter that ends \".au\") [G711], [MIME2].  A sending\n\
    \   implementation MAY support interoperability with VPIM v2 [VPIMV2R2],\n   in\
    \ which case, it MUST be able to record G.726 (indicated as\n   audio/32kadpcm)\
    \ [G726], [ADPCM].\n   Recipients MUST be able to play a raw G.711 mu-law message,\
    \ and MAY\n   be able to play G.726 (indicated as audio/32kadpcm) to provide\n\
    \   interoperability with VPIM v2.  A receiving implementation MAY also\n   be\
    \ able to play messages encoded with other codecs (either natively\n   or via\
    \ transcoding).\n   These requirements may be summarized as follows:\n   Codec\
    \           No VPIM v2 Support      With VPIM v2 Support\n                   Record\
    \    Playback      Record      Playback\n   -------------   ------    --------\
    \      ------      --------\n   G.711 mu-law     MUST      MUST          MUST\
    \        MUST\n   G.726            *         MAY           MUST        MUST\n\

    \   are discussed below.\n"
- title: 9.1.  Handling VPIM v2 Messages in an IVM Client
  contents:
  - "9.1.  Handling VPIM v2 Messages in an IVM Client\n   If an IVM-conformant client\
    \ is able to process a content type of\n   multipart/voice-message (by treating\
    \ it as multipart/mixed) and play\n   a G.726 encoded audio message within it\
    \ (indicated by a content type\n   of audio/32kadpcm), then a VPIM v2 message\
    \ that gets routed to that\n   desktop will be at least usable by the recipient.\n\
    \   This delivers a level of partial interoperability that would ease the\n  \
    \ life of end users.  However, care should be taken to ensure that any\n   attempt\
    \ to reply to such a message does not result in an invalid VPIM\n   v2 message\
    \ being sent to a VPIM v2 system.  Note that replying to an\n   e-mail user who\
    \ has forwarded a VPIM v2 message to you is, however,\n   acceptable.\n   A conformant\
    \ IVM implementation MUST NOT send a non-VPIM v2 message\n   to something it knows\
    \ to be a VPIM v2 system, unless it also knows\n   that the destination system\
    \ can handle such a message (even though\n   VPIM v2 systems are encouraged to\
    \ handle non-VPIM v2 messages in a\n   graceful manner).  In general, it must\
    \ be assumed that if a system\n   sends you a conformant VPIM v2 message, then\
    \ it is a VPIM v2 system,\n   and so you may only reply with a VPIM v2 compliant\
    \ message (unless\n   you know by some other means that the system supports IVM).\n\
    \   In addition, it should be noted that an IVM client may not fully\n   conform\
    \ to VPIM v2, even if it supports playing a G.726 message\n   (e.g., it may not\
    \ respect the handling of the Sensitivity field\n   required by VPIM v2).  This\
    \ is one reason why VPIM v2 systems may\n   choose not to route messages to any\
    \ system they do not know to be\n   VPIM v2 compliant.\n"
- title: 9.2.  Dual Mode Systems and Clients
  contents:
  - "9.2.  Dual Mode Systems and Clients\n   A VPIM v2 system could be extended to\
    \ also be able to support IVM\n   compliant messages, and an IVM conformant client\
    \ could be extended to\n   implement VPIM v2 in full when corresponding with a\
    \ VPIM v2 compliant\n   system.  This is simply a matter of implementing both\
    \ specifications\n   and selecting the appropriate one, depending on the received\
    \ message\n   content or the recipient's capabilities.  This delivers full\n \
    \  interoperability for the relevant systems, providing the capabilities\n   of\
    \ the target users can be determined.\n   Note that the mechanism for determining\
    \ if a given recipient is using\n   a VPIM v2 system or client is outside of the\
    \ scope of this\n   specification.  Various mechanisms for capabilities discovery\
    \ exist\n   that could be applied to this problem, but no standard solution has\n\
    \   yet been defined.\n"
- title: 9.3.  Gateways
  contents:
  - "9.3.  Gateways\n   It would be possible to build a gateway linking a set of VPIM\
    \ v2\n   users with a set of IVM users.  This gateway would implement the\n  \
    \ semantics of the two worlds, and translate between them according to\n   defined\
    \ policies.\n   For example, VPIM v2 messages with a Sensitivity of Private might\
    \ be\n   rejected instead of forwarded to an IVM recipient, because it might\n\
    \   not implement the semantics of a Private message, while an IVM\n   message\
    \ containing content not supported in VPIM v2 (e.g., a PNG\n   image), with a\
    \ Criticality of CRITICAL, would be rejected in the\n   gateway.\n   Such a gateway\
    \ MUST fully implement this specification and the VPIM\n   v2 specification [VPIMV2R2],\
    \ unless it knows somehow that the\n   specific originators/recipients support\
    \ capabilities beyond those\n   required by these standards.\n"
- title: 10.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "10.  Security Considerations\n   This document presents an optional gateway between\
    \ IVM and VPIM\n   systems.  Gateways are inherently lossy systems and not all\n\
    \   information can be accurately translated.  This applies to both the\n   transcoding\
    \ of the voice and the translation of features.  Two\n   examples of feature translation\
    \ are given in 9.3, but the risk\n   remains that different gateways will handle\
    \ the translation\n   differently since it is undefined in this document.  This\
    \ may lead to\n   unexpected behavior through gateways.\n   In addition, gateways\
    \ present an additional point of attack for those\n   interested in compromising\
    \ a messaging system.  If a gateway is\n   compromised, \"monkey in the middle\"\
    \ attacks, conducted from the\n   compromised gateway, may be difficult to detect\
    \ or appear to be\n   authorized transformations.\n   Aside from the gateway issue,\
    \ it is anticipated that there are no new\n   additional security issues beyond\
    \ those identified in VPIM v2\n   [VPIMV2R2] and in the other RFCs referenced\
    \ by this document --\n   especially SMTP [DRUMSMTP], Internet Message Format\
    \ [DRUMSIMF], MIME\n   [MIME2], Critical Content [CRITICAL], and Message Context\
