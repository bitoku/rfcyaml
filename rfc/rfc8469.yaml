  - "1.  Introduction\n   The pseudowire (PW) encapsulation of Ethernet, as defined
    in\n   [RFC4448], specifies that the use of the control word (CW) is\n   optional.
    \ It is common for label switching routers (LSRs) to search\n   past the end of
    the label stack to determine whether the payload is\n   an IP packet and then,
    if it is, select the next hop based on the\n   so-called \"five-tuple\" (IP source
    address, IP destination address,\n   protocol/next-header, transport-layer source
    port, and transport-\n   layer destination port).  In the absence of a PW CW,
    an Ethernet PW\n   packet can be misidentified as an IP packet by a label switching\n
    \  router (LSR) selecting the ECMP path based on the five-tuple.  This\n   may
    lead to the selection of the wrong ECMP path for the packet,\n   leading in turn
    to the misordering of packets.  Further discussion of\n   this topic is published
    in [RFC4928].\n   Flow misordering can also happen in a single-path scenario when\n
    \  traffic classification and differential forwarding treatment\n   mechanisms
    are in use.  These errors occur when a forwarder\n   incorrectly assumes that
    the packet is IP and applies a forwarding\n   policy based on fields in the PW
    payload.\n   IPv4 and IPv6 packets start with the values 0x4 and 0x6,\n   respectively.
    \ Misidentification can arise if an Ethernet PW packet\n   without a CW is carrying
    an Ethernet packet with a destination\n   address that starts with either of these
    values.\n   This problem has recently become more serious for a number of\n   reasons.
    \ First, the IEEE Registration Authority Committee (RAC) has\n   assigned Ethernet
    MAC addresses that start with 0x4 or 0x6, and\n   equipment that uses MAC addresses
    in these series has been deployed\n   in networks.  Second, concerns over privacy
    have led to the use of\n   MAC address randomization, which assigns local MAC
    addresses randomly\n   for privacy.  Random assignment results in addresses starting
    with\n   one of these two values approximately one time in eight.\n   The use
    of the Ethernet PW CW addresses this problem.\n   This document RECOMMENDS the
    use of the Ethernet PW CW in all but\n   exceptional circumstances.\n"

    in all\n   capitals, as shown here.\n"
  title: 2.  Specification of Requirements
- contents:
  - "3.  Background\n   Ethernet PW encapsulation is specified in [RFC4448].  Of particular\n
    \  relevance is Section 4.6, part of which is quoted below for the\n   convenience
    of the reader.  Note that RFC 4448 uses the citation\n   [PWE3-CW] to refer to
    [RFC4385] and the citation [VCCV] to refer to\n   the document that was eventually
    published as [RFC5085].\n      The control word defined in this section is based
    on the Generic\n      PW MPLS Control Word as defined in [PWE3-CW].  It provides
    the\n      ability to sequence individual frames on the PW, avoidance of\n      equal-cost
    multiple-path load-balancing (ECMP) [RFC2992], and\n      Operations and Management
    (OAM) mechanisms including VCCV [VCCV].\n      [PWE3-CW] states, \"If a PW is
    sensitive to packet misordering and\n      is being carried over an MPLS PSN that
    uses the contents of the\n      MPLS payload to select the ECMP path, it MUST
    employ a mechanism\n      which prevents packet misordering.\"  This is necessary
    because\n      ECMP implementations may examine the first nibble after the MPLS\n
    \     label stack to determine whether the labeled packet is IP or not.\n      Thus,
    if the source MAC address of an Ethernet frame carried over\n      the PW without
    a control word present begins with 0x4 or 0x6, it\n      could be mistaken for
    an IPv4 or IPv6 packet.  This could,\n      depending on the configuration and
    topology of the MPLS network,\n      lead to a situation where all packets for
    a given PW do not follow\n      the same path.  This may increase out-of-order
    frames on a given\n      PW, or cause OAM packets to follow a different path than
    actual\n      traffic (see Section 4.4.3, \"Frame Ordering\").\n      The features
    that the control word provides may not be needed for\n      a given Ethernet PW.
    \ For example, ECMP may not be present or\n      active on a given MPLS network,
    strict frame sequencing may not be\n      required, etc.  If this is the case,
    the control word provides\n      little value and is therefore optional.  Early
    Ethernet PW\n      implementations have been deployed that do not include a control\n
    \     word or the ability to process one if present.  To aid in\n      backwards
    compatibility, future implementations MUST be able to\n      send and receive
    frames without the control word present.\n   When PWs were first deployed, some
    equipment of commercial\n   significance was unable to process the Ethernet CW.
    \ In addition, at\n   that time, it was believed that no Ethernet MAC address
    had been\n   issued by the IEEE Registration Authority Committee (RAC) that\n
    \  started with 0x4 or 0x6; thus, it was thought to be safe to deploy\n   Ethernet
    PWs without the CW.\n   Since that time, the RAC has issued Ethernet MAC addresses
    that start\n   with 0x4 or with 0x6.  Therefore, the assumption that, in practical\n
    \  networks, there would be no confusion between an Ethernet PW packet\n   without
    the CW and an IP packet is no longer correct.\n   Possibly through the use of
    unauthorized Ethernet MAC addresses, this\n   assumption has been unsafe for a
    while, leading some equipment\n   vendors to implement more complex, proprietary
    methods to\n   discriminate between Ethernet PW packets and IP packets.  Such\n
    \  mechanisms rely on the heuristics of examining the transit packets to\n   try
    to find out the exact payload type of the packet and cannot be\n   reliable due
    to the random nature of the payload carried within such\n   packets.\n   A posting
    on the NANOG email list highlighted this problem:\n   <https://mailman.nanog.org/pipermail/nanog/2016-December/089395.html>\n"
  title: 3.  Background
- contents:
  - "4.  Recommendation\n   The ambiguity between an MPLS payload that is an Ethernet
    PW and one\n   that is an IP packet is resolved when the Ethernet PW CW is used.\n
    \  This document updates [RFC4448] to state that both the ingress\n   provider
    edge (PE) and the egress PE SHOULD support the Ethernet PW\n   CW and that, if
    supported, the CW MUST be used.\n   Where the application of ECMP to Ethernet
    PW traffic is required and\n   where both the ingress and the egress PEs support
    Entropy Label\n   Indicator / Entropy Label (ELI/EL) [RFC6790] and Flow-Aware
    Transport\n   of Pseudowires (FAT PW) [RFC6391], then either method may be used.\n
    \  The use of both methods on the same PW is not normally necessary and\n   should
    be avoided unless circumstances require it.  In the case of\n   multi-segment
    PWs, if ELI/EL is used, then it SHOULD be used on every\n   segment of the PW.
    \ The method by which usage of ELI/EL on every\n   segment is guaranteed is out
    of the scope of this document.\n"
  title: 4.  Recommendation
- contents:
  - "5.  Equal-Cost Multipath (ECMP)\n   Where the volume of traffic on an Ethernet
    PW is such that ECMP is\n   required, then one of two methods may be used:\n   o
    \ Flow-Aware Transport of Pseudowires over an MPLS Packet Switched\n      Network,
    specified in [RFC6391], or\n   o  Label Switched Path (LSP) entropy labels, specified
    in [RFC6790].\n   RFC 6391 works by increasing the entropy of the bottom-of-stack\n
    \  label.  It requires that both the ingress and egress PEs support this\n   feature.
    \ It also requires that sufficient LSRs on the LSP between\n   the ingress and
    egress PE be able to select an\n   ECMP path on an MPLS packet with the resultant
    stack depth.\n   RFC 6790 works by including an entropy value in the LSP part
    of the\n   label stack.  This requires that the ingress and egress PEs support\n
    \  the insertion and removal of the EL and the ELI and that sufficient\n   LSRs
    on the LSP are able to perform ECMP based on the EL.\n   In both cases, there
    are considerations in getting Operations,\n   Administration, and Maintenance
    (OAM) packets to follow the same path\n   as a data packet.  This is described
    in detail in Section 7 of\n   [RFC6391] and Section 6 of [RFC6790].  However,
    in both cases, the\n   situation is improved compared to the ECMP behavior in
    the case where\n   the Ethernet PW CW was not used, since there is currently no
    known\n   method of getting a PW OAM packet to follow the same path as a PW\n
    \  data packet subjected to ECMP based on the five-tuple of the IP\n   payload.\n
    \  The PW label is pushed before the LSP label.  As the ELI/EL labels\n   are
    part of the LSP layer rather than part of the PW layer, they are\n   pushed after
    the PW label has been pushed.\n"
  title: 5.  Equal-Cost Multipath (ECMP)
- contents:
  - "6.  Mitigations\n   Where it is not possible to use the Ethernet PW CW, the effects
    of\n   ECMP can be disabled by carrying the PW over a traffic-engineered\n   path
    that does not subject the payload to load balancing (for\n   example, RSVP-TE
    [RFC3209]).  However, such paths may be subjected to\n   link-bundle load balancing,
    and, of course, the single LSP has to\n   carry the full PW load.\n"
  title: 6.  Mitigations
- contents:
  - "7.  Operational Considerations\n   In some cases, the inclusion of a CW in the
    PW is determined by\n   equipment configuration.  Furthermore, it is possible
    that the\n   default configuration in such cases is to disable use of the CW.\n
    \  Care needs to be taken to ensure that software that implements this\n   recommendation
    does not depend on existing configuration settings\n   that prevent the use of
    a CW.  It is recommended that platform\n   software emit a rate-limited message
    indicating that the CW can be\n   used but is disabled due to existing configuration.\n
    \  Instead of including a payload type in the packet, MPLS relies on the\n   control
    plane to signal the payload type that follows the bottom of\n   the label stack.
    \ Some LSRs attempt to deduce the packet type by MPLS\n   payload inspection,
    in some cases looking past the PW CW.  If the\n   payload appears to be IP or
    IP carried in an Ethernet header, they\n   perform an ECMP calculation based on
    what they assume to be the\n   five-tuple fields.  However, deduction of the payload
    type in this\n   way is not an exact science, and where a packet that is not IP
    is\n   mistaken for an IP packet, the result can be packets delivered out of\n
    \  order.  Misordering of this type can be difficult for an operator to\n   diagnose.
    \ When enabling capability that allows information gleaned\n   from packet inspection
    past the PW CW to be used in any ECMP\n   calculation, operators should be aware
    that this may cause Ethernet\n   frames to be delivered out of order despite the
    presence of the CW.\n"

    existing and widely\n   deployed Ethernet PW encapsulation over another.  These

    \  This document introduces no additional security issues.\n"
