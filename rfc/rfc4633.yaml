  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   As discussed in RFC 3683, the IETF needs to have rules of\
    \ conduct to\n   limit disruptive or abusive behavior while permitting a fair\
    \ and open\n   forum for the discussion of Internet standardization.  The IETF\
    \ has a\n   long and complicated history of rules for managing conduct on its\n\
    \   mailing lists.\n   RFC 2418 [RFC2418] permitted individuals to be blocked\
    \ from posting\n   to a mailing list: \"As a last resort and after explicit warnings,\
    \ the\n   Area Director, with the approval of the IESG, may request that the\n\
    \   mailing list maintainer block the ability of the offending individual\n  \
    \ to post to the mailing list.\"  RFC 2418 also allowed other forms of\n   mailing\
    \ list control to be applied with the approval of the area\n   director and Internet\
    \ Engineering Steering Group (IESG).  However,\n   RFC 2418 applied only to working\
    \ group mailing lists.\n   The IETF discussion list charter [RFC3005] provides\
    \ guidelines for\n   ietf@ietf.org.  These guidelines provide more flexibility\
    \ than RFC\n   2418.  \"The IETF Chair, the IETF Executive Director, or a sergeant-\n\
    \   at-arms appointed by the Chair is empowered to restrict posting by a\n   person,\
    \ or of a thread, when the content is inappropriate and\n   represents a pattern\
    \ of abuse.  They are encouraged to take into\n   account the overall nature of\
    \ the postings by an individual and\n   whether particular postings are an aberration\
    \ or typical.  Complaints\n   regarding their decisions should be referred to\
    \ the IAB.\"  In\n   particular it appears that these decisions do not follow\
    \ the normal\n   appeals path outlined in RFC 2026 [RFC2026].\n   RFC 3683 [RFC3683]\
    \ provides a procedure for banning named individuals\n   from posting to an IETF\
    \ mailing list for at least one year.  However\n   once such a ban is put in place\
    \ for one mailing list, the individuals\n   responsible for other IETF mailing\
    \ lists can unilaterally remove the\n   posting rights of that individual.\n \
    \  RFC 3934 [RFC3934] amends RFC 2418 and grants the working group chair\n   the\
    \ ability to suspend a member's posting rights for 30 days.\n   However, it appears\
    \ to remove the ability of the AD and IESG to\n   approve longer suspensions or\
    \ alternative procedures: \"Other methods\n   of mailing list control, including\
    \ longer suspensions, must be\n   carried out in accordance with other IETF-approved\
    \ procedures.\"  An\n   argument could be made that the amendment was not intended\
    \ to remove\n   the already-approved procedures in RFC 2418, although a perhaps\n\
    \   stronger argument can be made that the actual textual changes have\n   the\
    \ effect of removing these procedures.\n   The IESG has issued a statement on\
    \ mailing list management [IESGLIST]\n   that allows working group mailing lists\
    \ to be moderated.  Under this\n   procedure, specific off-topic postings could\
    \ be discarded.  However,\n   this procedure does not allow the posting rights\
    \ of an individual to\n   be suspended; it simply allows the list as a whole to\
    \ be moderated.\n   The IESG issued a statement on disruptive postings [IESGDISRUPT]\
    \ .\n   This statement applies procedures similar to RFC 3934 and to the\n   statement\
    \ on moderated lists to non-working group lists.\n   The result of these guidelines\
    \ is that there is a large gap between\n   the levels of sanction that can be\
    \ applied.  An individual can be\n   suspended from a working group list easily\
    \ for 30 days.  However, the\n   only option available to the IESG that permits\
    \ a longer suspension\n   for any list besides ietf@ietf.org is the ability to\
    \ suspend an\n   individual for an indefinite time period from one list.  This\n\
    \   suspension can expand to any IETF list without community or IESG\n   involvement.\
    \  This memo is an RFC 3933 [RFC3933] experiment to\n   provide the IESG with\
    \ the ability to create additional mechanisms to\n   manage IETF mailing lists\
    \ while the community decides what mailing\n   list guidelines are appropriate.\
    \  In particular, this experiment\n   allows the IESG to create a level of sanction\
    \ between RFC 3934 and\n   RFC 3683 for working group lists and to create sanctions\
    \ other than\n   RFC 3683 for non-working group lists.  The goal of this experiment\
    \ is\n   to improve the functioning of IETF mailing lists while keeping the\n\
    \   process open and fair.  This experiment is successful if it gives the\n  \
    \ community useful input on how to design a mailing list management\n   process.\
    \  It is not expected that this experiment will be adopted in\n   its current\
    \ form as a permanent Best Current Practice (BCP).\n"

- title: 3.  Definition of IETF Mailing List
  contents:
  - "3.  Definition of IETF Mailing List\n   This experiment applies to all IETF mailing\
    \ lists, including those\n   not associated with a working group.  The definition\
    \ of a working\n   group list is clear, but the definition of an IETF mailing\
    \ list\n   comprehensive enough to include all IETF mailing lists is not\n   obvious.\
    \  For the purpose of this experiment, an IETF mailing list is\n   defined as\
    \ follows.\n   An \"IETF mailing list\" is defined as the IETF list itself, any\n\
    \   mailing list operated to further the work of a current IETF Working\n   Group\
    \ (WG), any mailing list created for WG use but retained for\n   ongoing discussion\
    \ after that WG was shut down, any mailing list\n   created in support of an IETF-specified\
    \ procedure (including mailing\n   lists whose purpose is the discussion of registration\
    \ actions), and\n   any mailing list hosted on any site or system operated by\
    \ the IASA or\n   otherwise on behalf of the IETF.  Mailing lists listed at\n\
    \   https://datatracker.ietf.org/public/nwg_list.cgi are explicitly\n   included\
    \ in this definition.\n"
- title: 4.  The Experiment
  contents:
  - "4.  The Experiment\n   This experiment runs for a period of 18 months.  During\
    \ the\n   experiment period, the IESG MAY approve other methods of mailing list\n\
    \   control besides those outlined in RFC 3683 and RFC 3934 to be used on\n  \
    \ a specified set of IETF mailing lists.  Such methods include but are\n   not\
    \ limited to suspending the posting rights of an individual beyond\n   30 days\
    \ on those lists.  Under such procedures the IESG may delegate\n   the authority\
    \ to perform longer-term suspensions of specific\n   individuals on specific mailing\
    \ lists.\n   The procedures of this memo MUST NOT be used to suspend the posting\n\
    \   rights of an individual beyond the period of the experiment.  The\n   procedures\
    \ of this memo MUST NOT be used to limit an individual's\n   ability to read the\
    \ contents of a mailing list.\n   The IESG MUST inform the community in a public\
    \ statement of any\n   procedures for mailing list management approved under this\n\
    \   experiment.  Such a statement should include the description of the\n   procedure\
    \ and the description of mailing lists to which it applies or\n   an indication\
    \ that it applies to all IETF mailing lists.  The IESG\n   MUST make a public\
    \ announcement of a new procedure at least 14 days\n   prior to the procedure\
    \ taking effect.  Although the community is\n   encouraged to comment on any IESG\
    \ action, community consensus is not\n   required to approve such a procedure.\
    \  All currently active\n   procedures under this experiment MUST be made public\
    \ in an\n   appropriate, easy-to-find location.\n   Sanctions made under this\
    \ memo may be appealed using the procedures\n   outlined in [RFC2026].\n"
- title: 5.  How the Experiment May Be Used (Informative)
  contents:
  - "5.  How the Experiment May Be Used (Informative)\n   The IESG could approve a\
    \ procedure allowing it to suspend an\n   individual from one or more mailing\
    \ lists for a fixed period of time\n   greater than 30 days.\n   Also, the IESG\
    \ could delegate this power.  Two types of delegation\n   are envisioned.  In\
    \ the first, the IESG has a procedure that allows\n   it to suspend a named individual\
    \ from a list and to grant the\n   managers of that list the delegated authority\
    \ to continue to apply\n   longer suspensions if disruptive behavior continues.\
    \  In the second,\n   the IESG approves a procedure that specifies a set of lists\
    \ and\n   allows managers of those lists to take action unilaterally after an\n\
    \   initial suspension in a manner similar to RFC 3683.\n"
