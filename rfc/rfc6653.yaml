    \   DHCPv6 Prefix Delegation in Long-Term Evolution (LTE) Networks\n"
- title: Abstract
  contents:
  - "Abstract\n   As interest in IPv6 deployment in cellular networks increases,\n\
    \   several migration issues have been being raised; IPv6 prefix\n   management\
    \ is the issue addressed in this document.  Based on the\n   idea that DHCPv6\
    \ servers can manage prefixes, we use DHCPv6 Prefix\n   Delegation to address\
    \ such prefix management issues as an access\n   router offloading delegation\
    \ of prefixes and release tasks to a\n   DHCPv6 server.  The access router first\
    \ requests a prefix for an\n   incoming mobile node from the DHCPv6 server.  The\
    \ access router may\n   next do stateless or stateful address allocation to the\
    \ mobile node,\n   e.g., with a Router Advertisement or using DHCP.  We also describe\n\
    \   prefix management using Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting\n  \
    \ (AAA) servers.\n"

    \ access\n   network.  In a Long-Term Evolution (LTE) network, the Access Router\n\

    \ Cellular Network\n   The Mobile Node (MN) attaches to a Base Station (BS) through\
    \ an LTE\n   air interface.  A BS manages connectivity of User Equipment (UE)\
    \ and\n   extends connections to an Access Gateway (GW), e.g., the Serving\n \
    \  Gateway (S-GW) in an LTE network.  The access GW and the AR are\n   connected\
    \ via an IP network.  The AR is the first-hop router of the\n   MNs and is in\
    \ charge of address/prefix management.\n   The AR is connected to an IP network\
    \ that is owned by the operator;\n   this network is connected to the public Internet\
    \ via a border router.\n   The network contains servers for subscriber management,\
    \ including\n   Quality of Service, billing, and accounting, as well as a Dynamic\n\
    \   Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) server [RFC6342].\n   With IPv6 addressing,\
    \ because mobile network links are point-to-point\n   (P2P), the per-MN interface\
    \ prefix model is used [RFC3314] [RFC3316].\n   In the per-MN interface prefix\
    \ model, prefix management is an issue.\n   When an MN attaches to an AR, the\
    \ AR requests one or more prefixes\n   for the MN.  When the MN detaches from\
    \ the AR, the prefixes should be\n   released.  When the MN becomes idle, the\
    \ AR should keep (i.e., not\n   release) the allocated prefixes.\n   This document\
    \ describes how to use DHCPv6 Prefix Delegation\n   (DHCPv6-PD) in mobile networks,\
    \ such as networks based on standards\n   developed by the 3rd Generation Partnership\
    \ Project (3GPP) and it\n   could easily be adopted by the Worldwide Interoperability\
    \ for\n   Microwave Access (WiMAX) Forum as well.  In view of migration to\n \
    \  IPv6, the number of MNs connected to the network at a given time may\n   become\
    \ very high.  Traditional techniques such as prefix pools are\n   not scalable.\
    \  In such cases, DHCPv6-PD becomes the viable approach\n   to take.\n   The techniques\
    \ described in this document have not been approved by\n   the IETF or the 3GPP,\
    \ except for those techniques described below in\n   Section 3.3.  This document\
    \ is not a Standard or Best Current\n   Practice.  This document is published\
    \ only for possible consideration\n   by operators.\n   This document is useful\
    \ when address space needs to be managed by\n   DHCPv6-PD.  There are obviously\
    \ other means of managing address\n   space, including having the AR track internally\
    \ what address space is\n   used by what mobile.\n"

    \ to as UE, or User Equipment, by the 3GPP)\n       performs initial network entry\
    \ and authentication procedures,\n       a.k.a. the attach procedure.\n   2. \
    \ On successful completion of Step 1, the AR initiates the DHCP\n       Solicit\
    \ procedure to request prefixes for the MN.  The DHCP\n       client in the AR\
    \ creates and transmits a Solicit message as\n       described in Sections 17.1.1\
    \ (\"Creation of Solicit Messages\") and\n       17.1.2 (\"Transmission of Solicit\
    \ Messages\") of [RFC3315].  The\n       DHCP client in an AR that supports DHCPv6\
    \ Prefix Delegation\n       [RFC3633] creates an Identity Association for Prefix\
    \ Delegation\n       (IA_PD) and assigns it an Identity Association IDentifier\
    \ (IAID).\n       The client must include the IA_PD option in the Solicit message.\n\
    \       The DHCP client as Requesting Router (RR) must set the\n       prefix-length\
    \ field to a value less than, e.g., 48 or equal to 64\n       to request a /64\
    \ prefix.  Next, the relay agent in the AR sends\n       to the DHCP server a\
    \ Relay-forward message in which a Solicit\n       message is encapsulated.\n\
    \   3.  The DHCP server sends an Advertise message to the AR in the same\n   \
    \    way as that described in Section 17.2.2 (\"Creation and\n       Transmission\
    \ of Advertise Messages\") of [RFC3315].  An Advertise\n       message with the\
    \ IA_PD shows that the DHCP server is capable of\n       delegating prefixes.\
    \  This message is received encapsulated in a\n       Relay-reply message by the\
    \ relay agent in the AR and is sent as\n       an Advertise message to the DHCP\
    \ client in the AR.\n   4.  The AR (DHCP client and relay agent) uses the same\
    \ message\n       exchanges as those described in Section 18 (\"DHCP Client-\n\
    \       Initiated Configuration Exchange\") of [RFC3315] and in [RFC3633]\n  \
    \     to obtain or update prefixes from the DHCP server.  The AR (DHCP\n     \
    \  client and relay agent) and the DHCP server use the IA_PD Prefix\n       option\
    \ to exchange information about prefixes in much the same\n       way as IA Address\
    \ options are used for assigned addresses.  This\n       is accomplished by the\
    \ AR sending a DHCP Request message and the\n       DHCP server sending a DHCP\
    \ Reply message.\n   5.  The AR stores the prefix information it received in the\
    \ Reply\n       message.\n   6.  A connection between the MN and AR is established,\
    \ and the link\n       becomes active.  This step completes the Packet Data Protocol\n\
    \       (PDP) Context Activation Procedure in Universal Mobile\n       Telecommunications\
    \ System (UMTS) and PDN connection establishment\n       in LTE networks.\n  \
    \ 7.  The MN may send a Router Solicitation message to solicit the AR\n      \
    \ to send a Router Advertisement (RA) message.\n   8.  The AR advertises the prefixes\
    \ received in the IA_PD option to\n       the MN via an RA once the PDP Context/PDN\
    \ connection is\n       established, or in response to a Router Solicitation message\
    \ sent\n       from the MN.\n   The 4-way exchange between the AR as RR and the\
    \ DHCP server as\n   Delegating Router (DR), as shown in Figure 2, may be reduced\
    \ to a\n   two-message exchange by using the Rapid Commit option [RFC3315].  The\n\
    \   DHCP client in the AR acting as RR includes a Rapid Commit option in\n   the\
    \ Solicit message.  The DR then sends a Reply message containing\n   one or more\
    \ prefixes.\n"

    \ in Figure 2; in this type of configuration, there are two\n   function modules\
    \ in the AR: the DHCP server and the DHCP client.\n   After the initial attach\
    \ is completed, a connection to the AR is\n   established for the MN.  The DHCP\

    \ prefix aging, or via the\n   DHCP release procedure.  In prefix aging, a prefix\
    \ should not be used\n   by an MN when the prefix ages, and the DHCP server can\
    \ delegate it to\n   another MN.  A prefix lifetime is delivered from the DHCPv6\
    \ server to\n   the MN via the DHCP IA_PD Prefix option [RFC3633] and the RA Prefix\n\
    \   Information option [RFC4861].  Figure 4 illustrates how the AR\n   releases\
    \ prefixes to a DHCP server that isn't directly connected to\n   the AR:\n   1.\
    \  A signal that an MN has detached, such as switch-off or handover,\n       triggers\
    \ the prefix release procedure.\n   2.  The AR initiates a Release message to\
    \ give the prefixes back to\n       the DHCP server.\n   3.  The server responds\
    \ with a Reply message.  The prefixes can then\n       be reused by other MNs.\n\

- title: 3.5.1.  How to Generate an IAID
  contents:
  - "3.5.1.  How to Generate an IAID\n   The IAID is 4 bytes in length and should\
    \ be unique in the scope of an\n   AR.  The prefix table should be maintained;\
    \ this table contains the\n   IAID, the Media Access Control (MAC) address, and\
    \ the prefix(es)\n   assigned to the MN.  In LTE networks, the International Mobile\n\
    \   Equipment Identity (IMEI) uniquely identifies the MN's interface and\n   thus\
    \ corresponds to the MAC address.  The MAC address of the\n   interface should\
    \ be stored in the prefix table and is used as the key\n   for searching the table.\n\
    \   The IAID should be set to Start_IAID; Start_IAID is an integer of\n   4 octets.\
    \  The following algorithm is used to generate the IAID:\n   1.  Set this IAID\
    \ value in the IA_PD Prefix option.  Request a prefix\n       for this MN as described\
    \ in Section 3.1 or Section 3.2.\n   2.  Store the IAID, MAC address, and received\
    \ prefix(es) in the next\n       entry of the prefix table.\n   3.  Increment\
    \ the IAID.\n   A prefix table entry for an MN that hands over to another AR must\
    \ be\n   removed.  The IAID value is released and can then be reused.\n"
- title: 3.5.2.  Policy to Delegate Prefixes
  contents:
  - "3.5.2.  Policy to Delegate Prefixes\n   In P2P links, if /64 prefixes of all\
    \ MNs connected to one or more ARs\n   are broadcast dynamically upstream as route\
    \ information, high\n   routing-protocol traffic (IGP, OSPF, etc.) due to per-MN\
    \ interface\n   prefixes will result.  There are two solutions to this problem.\
    \  One\n   solution is to use static configuration, which would be preferable\
    \ in\n   many cases.  No routing protocols are needed, because each AR has a\n\
    \   known piece of address space.  If the DHCP servers also know that\n   address\
    \ space, then they will assign to a particular AR a prefix from\n   that space.\n\
    \   The other solution is to use route aggregation.  For example, each AR\n  \
    \ can be assigned a /48 or /32 prefix (an aggregate prefix, a.k.a\n   service\
    \ provider common prefix), while each interface of an MN can be\n   assigned a\
    \ /64 prefix.  The /64 prefix is an extension of the /48\n   prefix -- for example,\
    \ an AR's /48 prefix is 2001:db8:0::/48 -- while\n   an interface of the MN is\
    \ assigned a 2001:db8:0:2::/64 prefix.  The\n   border router in Figure 1 may\
    \ be manually configured to broadcast\n   only an individual AR's /48 or /32 prefix\
    \ information to the\n   Internet.\n"
- title: 4.  Prefix Delegation Using RADIUS and Diameter
  contents:
  - "4.  Prefix Delegation Using RADIUS and Diameter\n   In the initial network entry\
    \ procedure shown in Figure 2, the AR as\n   Remote Authentication Dial In User\
    \ Service (RADIUS) client sends an\n   Access-Request message with MN information\
    \ to the RADIUS server.  If\n   the MN passes the authentication, the RADIUS server\
    \ may send an\n   Access-Accept message with prefix information to the AR using\
    \ the\n   Framed-IPv6-Prefix attribute.  The AAA server also provides routing\n\
    \   information to be configured for the MN on the AR using the\n   Framed-IPv6-Route\
    \ attribute.  Using such a process, the AR can handle\n   initial prefix assignments\
    \ to MNs, but managing the lifetime of the\n   prefixes is totally left to the\
    \ AR.  The Framed-IPv6-Prefix is not\n   designed to support delegation of IPv6\
    \ prefixes.  For this situation,\n   the Delegated-IPv6-Prefix attribute, which\
    \ is discussed below, can be\n   used.\n   [RFC4818] defines a RADIUS attribute,\
    \ Delegated-IPv6-Prefix, which\n   carries an IPv6 prefix to be delegated.  This\
    \ attribute is usable\n   within either RADIUS or Diameter.  [RFC4818] recommends\
    \ that the DR\n   use the AAA server to receive the prefixes to be delegated,\
    \ by using\n   the Delegated-IPv6-Prefix attribute/Attribute-Value Pair (AVP).\n\
    \   The DHCP server as DR, as shown in Figure 2, may send an\n   Access-Request\
    \ packet containing the Delegated-IPv6-Prefix attribute\n   to the RADIUS server\
    \ to request prefixes.  In the Access-Request\n   message, the DR may provide\
    \ a hint that it would prefer a prefix --\n   for example, a /48 prefix.  As the\
    \ RADIUS server is not required to\n   honor the hint, the server may delegate\
    \ a longer prefix -- e.g., /56\n   or /64 -- in an Access-Accept message containing\
    \ the\n   Delegated-IPv6-Prefix attribute [RFC4818].  The attribute can appear\n\
    \   multiple times when the RADIUS server delegates multiple prefixes to\n   the\
    \ DR.  The DR sends the prefixes to the RR using the IA_PD option,\n   and the\
    \ AR as RR uses them for MNs, as described in Section 3.\n   When Diameter is\
    \ used, the DHCP server as DR, as shown in Figure 2,\n   sends an AA-Request message.\
    \  The AA-Request message may contain a\n   Delegated-IPv6-Prefix AVP.  The Diameter\
    \ server replies with an\n   AA-Answer message.  The AA-Answer message may contain\
    \ a\n   Delegated-IPv6-Prefix AVP.  The AVP can appear multiple times when\n \
    \  the Diameter server assigns multiple prefixes to an MN.  The\n   Delegated-IPv6-Prefix\
    \ AVP may appear in an AA-Request packet as a\n   hint from the AR to the Diameter\
    \ server that it would prefer a\n   prefix -- for example, a /48 prefix.  The\
    \ Diameter server may\n   delegate in the AA-Answer message a /64 prefix, which\
    \ is an extension\n   of the /48 prefix.  As in the case of RADIUS, the DR sends\
    \ the\n   prefixes to the RR using the IA_PD option, and the AR as RR uses them\n\
    \   for the MNs as described in Section 3.\n"
