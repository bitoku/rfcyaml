  - "                IMP/TIP Preventive Maintenance Schedule\n      This RFC corrects\
    \ numerous inaccuracies in RFC #633.  Rather than\n      trying to list all the\
    \ changes, I urge all Liaisons and other\n      interested parties to look carefully\
    \ at the times now listed for\n      the sites they are interested in.\n   This\
    \ note presents the current IMP/TIP Preventive Maintenance\n   schedule.  Preventive\
    \ Maintenance is scheduled on a monthly basis and\n   a given machine is normally\
    \ scheduled at the same time each month;\n   wherever possible the time is chosen\
    \ to coincide with the PM time for\n   the Host(s) at the site.\n   It is sometimes\
    \ necessary to reschedule PM's because of network\n   connectivity considerations\
    \ or for other reasons.  Whenever this is\n   necessary we will follow the usual\
    \ procedure for scheduling down time\n   with our \"primary contact\" at the site.\
    \  Permanent changes to the\n   schedule will he announced via the RFC mechanism.\n\
    \   PM's normally do not require the IMP/TIP to be taken down.  However,\n   machines\
    \ must be taken down in some cases, so no one should rely on\n   the machine remaining\
    \ available through the PM period.\n   PLEASE REMEMBER THAT TUESDAY MORNINGS FROM\
    \ 7am TO 9am ARE RESERVED\n   FOR NETWORK SOFTWARE MAINTENANCE.\n   All times\
    \ shown below are Eastern Time.\n    First Monday (of each month)\n         5\
