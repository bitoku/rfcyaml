  - "1.  Introduction\n   [RFC2731] defines \"Encoding Dublin Core Metadata in HTML\"\
    .  Newer\n   specifications published by the Dublin Core Metadata Initiative\n\
    \   (http://dublincore.org/) over the last decade, in particular\n   \"Expressing\
    \ Dublin Core metadata using HTML/XHTML meta and link\n   elements\" ([DC-HTML]),\
    \ have obsoleted this work.\n      Note: Implementers of RFC 2731 should note\
    \ that DC-HTML introduces\n      a new requirement with respect to the use of\
    \ the \"head\" element's\n      \"profile\" attribute.\n"
