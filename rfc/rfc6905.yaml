- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   The Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM) generally\n\
    \   covers various production aspects of a network.  In this document, we\n  \
    \ use the term OAM as defined in [RFC6291].\n   The success of network operations\
    \ depends on the ability to\n   proactively monitor it for faults, performance,\
    \ etc., as well as the\n   ability to efficiently and quickly troubleshoot defects\
    \ and failures.\n   A well-defined OAM toolset is a vital requirement for wider\
    \ adoption\n   of Transparent Interconnection of Lots of Links (TRILL) as the\
    \ next\n   generation data-forwarding technology in larger networks such as data\n\
    \   centers.\n   In this document, we define the requirements for TRILL OAM. \
    \ It is\n   assumed that the readers are familiar with the OAM concepts and\n\
    \   terminologies defined in other OAM standards such as [8021ag],\n   [RFC5860],\
    \ and [RFC4377].  This document does not attempt to redefine\n   the terms and\
    \ concepts specified elsewhere.\n"
- title: 1.1.  Scope
  contents:
  - "1.1.  Scope\n   The scope of this document is OAM between Routing Bridges (RBridges)\n\
    \   of a TRILL campus over links selected by TRILL routing.\n"
- title: 2.  Conventions Used in This Document
  contents:
  - "2.  Conventions Used in This Document\n   The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\"\
    , \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\"\
    , \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n   document are to be interpreted as described\
    \ in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].\n   Although this document is not a protocol specification,\
    \ the use of\n   this language clarifies the instructions to protocol designers\n\
    \   producing solutions that satisfy the requirements set out in this\n   document.\n"
- title: 3.  Terminology
  contents:
  - "3.  Terminology\n   Section: This term refers to a segment of a path between\
    \ any two\n   given RBridges.  As an example, consider the case where RB1 is\n\
    \   connected to RBx via RB2, RB3, and RB4.  The segment between RB2 to\n   RB4\
    \ is referred to as a section of the path RB1 to RBx.  More details\n   of this\
    \ definition can be found in [RFC5960].\n   Flow: This term indicates a set of\
    \ packets that share the same path\n   and per-hop behavior (such as priority).\
    \  A flow is typically\n   identified by a portion of the inner payload that affects\
    \ the hop-by-\n   hop forwarding decisions.  This may contain Layer 2 through\
    \ Layer 4\n   information.\n   All Selectable Least-Cost Paths: This term refers\
    \ to a subset of all\n   potentially available least-cost paths to a specified\
    \ destination\n   RBridge that are available (and usable) for forwarding of frames.\
    \  It\n   is important to note that in practice, due to limitations in\n   implementations,\
    \ not all available least-cost paths may be selectable\n   for forwarding.\n \
    \  Connectivity: This term indicates reachability between an arbitrary\n   RBridge\
    \ RB1 and any other RBridge RB2.  The specific path can be\n   either explicit\
    \ (i.e., associated with a specific flow) or\n   unspecified.  Unspecified means\
    \ that messages used for connectivity\n   verification take whatever path the\
    \ RBs happen to select.  Please\n   refer to [OAMOVER] for details.\n   Continuity\
    \ Verification: This term refers to proactive verification\n   of liveliness between\
    \ two RBridges at periodic intervals and the\n   generation of explicit notification\
    \ when connectivity failures occur.\n   Please refer to [OAMOVER] for details.\n\
    \   Fault: This term refers to an inability to perform a required action,\n  \
    \ e.g., an unsuccessful attempt to deliver a packet.  Please refer to\n   [TERMTP]\
    \ for definition.\n   Defect: This term refers to an interruption in the normal\
    \ operation,\n   such that over a period of time no packets are delivered\n  \
    \ successfully.  Please refer to [TERMTP] for definition.\n   Failure: This term\
    \ refers to the termination of the required function\n   over a longer period\
    \ of time.  Persistence of a defect for a period\n   of time is interpreted as\
    \ a failure.  Please refer to [TERMTP] for\n   definition.\n   Simulated Flow:\
    \ This term refers to a sequence of OAM-generated\n   packets designed to follow\
    \ a specific path.  The fields of the\n   packets in the simulated flow may or\
    \ may not be identical to the\n   fields of data packets of an actual flow being\
    \ simulated.  However,\n   the purpose of the simulated flow is to have OAM packets\
    \ of the\n   simulated flow follow a specific path.\n"

  contents:
  - "4.1.  Data Plane\n   OAM frames, utilized for connectivity verification, continuity\n\
    \   checks, performance measurements, etc., will by default take whatever\n  \
    \ path TRILL chooses based on the current topology and per-hop equal-\n   cost\
    \ path choices.  In some cases, it may be required that the OAM\n   frames utilize\
    \ specific paths.  Thus, it MUST be possible to arrange\n   that OAM frames follow\
    \ the path taken by a specific flow.\n   RBridges MUST have the ability to identify\
    \ frames that require OAM\n   processing.\n   TRILL OAM frames MUST remain within\
    \ a TRILL campus and MUST NOT be\n   egressed from a TRILL network as native frames.\n\

    \ multiple\n   concurrent sessions for multiple OAM functions between any arbitrary\n\
    \   RBridge RB1 to any other RBridge.  In general, multiple OAM\n   operations\
    \ will run concurrently.  For example, proactive continuity\n   checks may take\
    \ place between RB1 and RB2 at the same time that an\n   operator decides to test\
    \ connectivity between the same two RBs.\n   Multiple OAM functions and instances\
    \ of those functions MUST be able\n   to run concurrently without interfering\
    \ with each other.\n   OAM MUST provide a single OAM framework for all TRILL OAM\
    \ functions\n   within the scope of this document.\n   OAM, as practical and as\
    \ possible, SHOULD reuse functional,\n   operational, and semantic elements of\
    \ existing OAM standards.\n   OAM MUST maintain related error and operational\
    \ counters.  Such\n   counters MUST be accessible via network management applications\n\
    \   (e.g., SNMP).\n   OAM functions related to continuity and connectivity checks\
    \ MUST be\n   able to be invoked either proactively or on demand.\n   OAM MAY\
    \ be required to provide the ability to specify a desired\n   response mode for\
    \ a specific OAM message.  The desired response mode\n   can be in-band, out-of-band,\
    \ or none.\n   The OAM Framework MUST be extensible to include new functionality.\n\
    \   For example, the solution needs to include a version number to\n   differentiate\
    \ older and newer implementations and TLV structures for\n   flexibility to include\
    \ new information elements.\n   OAM MAY provide methods to verify control-plane\
    \ and forwarding-plane\n   alignments.\n   OAM SHOULD leverage existing OAM technologies,\

  contents:
  - "4.6.1.  Packet Loss\n   In this document, the term \"packet loss\" is used as\
    \ defined in\n   Section 2.4 of [RFC2680].\n   OAM SHOULD provide the ability\
    \ to measure packet loss statistics for\n   a flow from any arbitrary RBridge\

- title: 4.6.2.  Packet Delay
  contents:
  - "4.6.2.  Packet Delay\n   There are two types of packet delays -- one-way delay\
    \ and two-way\n   delay (Round-Trip Delay).\n   One-way delay is defined in [RFC2679]\
    \ as the time elapsed from the\n   start of transmission of the first bit of a\
    \ packet by an RBridge\n   until the reception of the last bit of the packet by\
    \ the destination\n   RBridge.\n   Two-way delay is also referred to as Round-Trip\
    \ Delay and is defined\n   similar to [RFC2681]; i.e., the time elapsed from the\
    \ start of\n   transmission of the first bit of a packet from RB1, receipt of\
    \ the\n   packet at RB2, RB2 sending a response packet back to RB1, and RB1\n\
    \   receiving the last bit of that response packet.\n   OAM SHOULD provide functions\
    \ to measure two-way delay between two\n   RBridges.\n   OAM MAY provide functions\
    \ to measure one-way delay between two\n   RBridges for a specified flow.\n  \

  contents:
  - "4.7.  ECMP Utilization\n   OAM MAY provide functionality to monitor the effectiveness\
    \ of per-hop\n   Equal-Cost Multipath (ECMP) hashing.  For example, individual\n\
    \   RBridges could maintain counters that show how packets are being\n   distributed\
    \ across equal-cost next hops for a specified destination\n   RBridge or RBridges\
    \ as a result of ECMP hashing.\n"
