  - "1.  Introduction\n   Instant messaging is defined in RFC2778 [5].  At the time
    this\n   document was written, numerous instant messaging protocols are in\n   use,
    and little interoperability between services based on these\n   protocols has
    been achieved.  This specification defines semantics\n   and data formats for
    common services of instant messaging to\n   facilitate the creation of gateways
    between instant messaging\n   services: a common profile for instant messaging
    (CPIM).\n   Service behavior is described abstractly in terms of operations\n
    \  invoked between the consumer and provider of a service.  Accordingly,\n   each
    IM service must specify how this behavior is mapped onto its own\n   protocol
    interactions.  The choice of strategy is a local matter,\n   providing that there
    is a clear relation between the abstract\n   behaviors of the service (as specified
    in this memo) and how it is\n   faithfully realized by a particular instant messaging
    service.  For\n   example, one strategy might transmit an instant message as textual\n
    \  key/value pairs, another might use a compact binary representation,\n   and
    a third might use nested containers.\n   The attributes for each operation are
    defined using an abstract\n   syntax.  Although the syntax specifies the range
    of possible data\n   values, each IM service must specify how well-formed instances
    of the\n   abstract representation are encoded as a concrete series of bits.\n
    \  In order to provide a means for the preservation of end-to-end\n   features
    (especially security) to pass through instant messaging\n   interoperability gateways,
    this specification also provides\n   recommendations for instant messaging document
    formats that could be\n   employed by instant messaging protocols.\n"

  - "2.  Terminology\n   In this document, the key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\",\n
    \  \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\", \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"NOT\n
    \  RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" are to be interpreted as\n   described
    in RFC 2119 [1] and indicate requirement levels for\n   compliant implementations.\n
    \  This memos makes use of the vocabulary defined in RFC 2778 [5].\n   Terms such
    as CLOSED, INSTANT INBOX, INSTANT MESSAGE, and OPEN are\n   used in the same meaning
    as defined therein.\n   The term 'gateway' used in this document denotes a network
    element\n   responsible for interworking between diverse instant messaging\n   protocols.
    \ Although the instant messaging protocols themselves are\n   diverse, under the
    model used in this document these protocols can\n   carry a common payload that
    is relayed by the gateway.  Whether these\n   interworking intermediaries should
    be called 'gateways' or 'relays'\n   is therefore somewhat debatable; for the
    purposes of this document,\n   they are called 'CPIM gateways'.\n   The term 'instant
    messaging service' also derives from RFC 2778, but\n   its meaning changes slightly
    due to the existence of gateways in the\n   CPIM model.  When a client sends an
    operation to an instant messaging\n   service, that service might either be an
    endpoint or an intermediary\n   such as a CPIM gateway - in fact, the client should
    not have to be\n   aware which it is addressing, as responses from either will
    appear\n   the same.\n   This document defines operations and attributes of an
    abstract\n   instant messaging protocol.  In order for a compliant protocol to\n
    \  interface with an instant messaging gateway, it must support all of\n   the
    operations described in this document (i.e., the instant\n   messaging protocol
    must have some message or capability that provides\n   the function described
    by each of the given operations).  Similarly,\n   the attributes defined for these
    operations must correspond to\n   information available in the instant messaging
    protocol in order for\n   the protocol to interface with gateways defined by this\n
    \  specification.  Note that these attributes provide only the minimum\n   possible
    information that needs to be specified for interoperability\n   - the functions
    in an instant messaging protocol that correspond to\n   the operations described
    in this document can contain additional\n   information that will not be mapped
    by CPIM.\n"

    - "3.1.  Overview of Instant Messaging Service\n   When an application wants to
      send a message to an INSTANT INBOX, it\n   invokes the message operation, e.g.,\n
      \  +-------+                    +-------+\n   |       |                    |
      \      |\n   | appl. | -- message ------> |  IM   |\n   |       |                    |
      svc.  |\n   +-------+                    +-------+\n   The message operation
      has the following attributes: source,\n   destination, MaxForwards and TransID.
      \ 'source' and 'destination'\n   identify the originator and recipient of an
      instant message,\n   respectively, and consist of an INSTANT INBOX identifier
      (as\n   described in Section 3.2).  The MaxForwards is a hop counter to avoid\n
      \  loops through gateways, with usage detailed defined in Section 3.4.2;\n   its
      initial value is set by the originator.  The TransID is a unique\n   identifier
      used to correlate message operations to response\n   operations; gateways should
      be capable of handling TransIDs up to 40\n   bytes in length.\n   The message
      operation also has some content, the instant message\n   itself, which may be
      textual, or which may consist of other data.\n   Content details are specified
      in Section 3.3.\n   Note that this specification assumes that instant messaging
      protocols\n   provide reliable message delivery; there are no application-layer\n
      \  message delivery assurance provisions in this specification.\n   Upon receiving
      a message operation, the service immediately responds\n   by invoking the response
      operation containing the same transaction-\n   identifier, e.g.,\n   +-------+
      \                   +-------+\n   |       |                    |       |\n   |
      appl. | <----- response -- |  IM   |\n   |       |                    |  svc.
      |\n   +-------+                    +-------+\n   The response operation contains
      the following attributes: TransID and\n   status.  The TransID is used to correlate
      the response to a\n   particular instant message.  Status indicates whether
      the delivery of\n   the message succeeded or failed.  Valid status values are
      described\n   in Section 3.4.1.\n"

      - "3.4.1.  The Message Operation\n   When an application wants to send an INSTANT
        MESSAGE, it invokes the\n   message operation.\n   When an instant messaging
        service receives the message operation, it\n   performs the following preliminary
        checks:\n   1.  If the source or destination does not refer to a syntactically\n
        \      valid INSTANT INBOX, a response operation having status \"failure\"\n
        \      is invoked.\n   2.  If the destination of the operation cannot be resolved
        by the\n       recipient, and the recipient is not the final recipient, a\n
        \      response operation with the status \"failure\" is invoked.\n   3.  If
        access control does not permit the application to request this\n       operation,
        a response operation having status \"failure\" is\n       invoked.\n   4.
        \ Provided these checks are successful:\n          If the instant messaging
        service is able to successfully\n          deliver the message, a response
        operation having status\n          \"success\" is invoked.\n          If the
        service is unable to successfully deliver the message,\n          a response
        operation having status \"failure\" is invoked.\n          If the service
        must delegate responsibility for delivery\n          (i.e., if it is acting
        as a gateway or proxying the\n          operation), and if the delegation
        will not result in a future\n          authoritative indication to the service,
        a response operation\n          having status \"indeterminant\" is invoked.\n
        \         If the service must delegate responsibility for delivery, and\n
        \         if the delegation will result in a future authoritative\n          indication
        to the service, then a response operation is\n          invoked immediately
        after the indication is received.\n   When the service invokes the response
        operation, the transID\n   parameter is identical to the value found in the
        message operation\n   invoked by the application.\n"

      - "3.4.2.  Looping\n   The dynamic routing of instant messages can result in
        looping of a\n   message through a relay.  Detection of loops is not always
        obvious,\n   since aliasing and group list expansions can legitimately cause
        a\n   message to pass through a relay more than one time.\n   This document
        assumes that instant messaging protocols that can be\n   gatewayed by CPIM
        support some semantic equivalent to an integer\n   value that indicates the
        maximum number of hops through which a\n   message can pass.  When that number
        of hops has been reached, the\n   message is assumed to have looped.\n   When
        a CPIM gateway relays an instant message, it decrements the\n   value of the
        MaxForwards attribute.  This document does not mandate\n   any particular
        initial setting for the MaxForwards element in instant\n   messaging protocols,
        but it is recommended that the value be\n   reasonably large (over one hundred).\n
        \  If a CPIM gateway receives an instant message operation that has a\n   MaxForwards
        attribute of 0, it discards the message and invokes a\n   failure operation.\n"

  - "4.  Security Considerations\n   Detailed security considerations for instant
    messaging protocols are\n   given in RFC 2779 [6] (in particular, requirements
    are given in\n   section 5.4 and some motivating discussion with 8.1).\n   CPIM
    defines an interoperability function that is employed by\n   gateways between
    instant messaging protocols.  CPIM gateways MUST be\n   compliant with the minimum
    security requirements of the instant\n   messaging protocols with which they interface.\n
    \  The introduction of gateways to the security model of instant\n   messaging
    in RFC 2779 also introduces some new risks.  End-to-end\n   security properties
    (especially confidentiality and integrity)\n   between instant messaging user
    agents that interface through a CPIM\n   gateway can only be provided if a common
    instant message format (such\n   as the format described in MSGFMT [4]) is supported
    by the protocols\n   interfacing with the CPIM gateway.\n   When end-to-end security
    is required, the message operation MUST use\n   MSGFMT, and MUST secure the MSGFMT
    MIME body with S/MIME [8], with\n   encryption (CMS EnvelopeData) and/or S/MIME
    signatures (CMS\n   SignedData).\n   The S/MIME algorithms are set by CMS [9].
    \ The AES [11] algorithm\n   should be preferred, as it is expected that AES best
    suits the\n   capabilities of many platforms.  Implementations MAY use AES as
    an\n   encryption algorithm, but are REQUIRED to support only the baseline\n   algorithms
    mandated by S/MIME and CMS.\n   When IM URIs are placed in instant messaging protocols,
    they convey\n   the identity of the sender and/or the recipient.  Certificates
    that\n   are used for S/MIME IM operations SHOULD, for the purposes of\n   reference
    integrity, contain a subjectAltName field containing the IM\n   URI of their subject.
    \ Note that such certificates may also contain\n   other identifiers, including
    those specific to particular instant\n   messaging protocols.  In order to further
    facilitate interoperability\n   of secure messaging through CPIM gateways, users
    and service\n   providers are encouraged to employ trust anchors for certificates\n
    \  that are widely accepted rather than trust anchors specific to any\n   particular
    instant messaging service or provider.\n   In some cases, anonymous messaging
    may be desired.  Such a capability\n   is beyond the scope of this specification.\n"

    - "B.1.  Address Mapping\n   When mapping the service described in this memo,
      mappings that place\n   special information into the im: address local-part
      MUST use the\n   meta-syntax defined in RFC 2846 [7].\n"
    title: B.1.  Address Mapping
  - contents:
    - "B.2.  Source-Route Mapping\n   The easiest mapping technique is a form of source-routing
      and usually\n   is the least friendly to humans having to type the string.  Source-\n
      \  routing also has a history of operational problems.\n   Use of source-routing
      for exchanges between different services is by\n   a transformation that places
      the entire, original address string into\n   the im: address local part and
      names the gateway in the domain part.\n   For example, if the destination INSTANT
      INBOX is \"pepp://example.com/\n   fred\", then, after performing the necessary
      character conversions,\n   the resulting mapping is:\n             im:pepp=example.com/fred@relay-domain\n
      \  where \"relay-domain\" is derived from local configuration information.\n
      \  Experience shows that it is vastly preferable to hide this mapping\n   from
      end-users - if possible, the underlying software should perform\n   the mapping
      automatically.\n"
