  - "Abstract\n   This document describes one certificate extension that explicitly\n\
    \   states the Attribute Certificate Policies (ACPs) that apply to a\n   given\
    \ Attribute Certificate (AC).  The goal of this document is to\n   allow relying\
    \ parties to perform an additional test when validating\n   an AC, i.e., to assess\
    \ whether a given AC carrying some attributes\n   can be accepted on the basis\
    \ of references to one or more specific\n   ACPs.\n"
- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   When issuing a Public Key Certificate (PKC), a Certificate\
    \ Authority\n   (CA) can perform various levels of verification with regard to\
    \ the\n   subject identity (see [RFC3280]).  A CA makes its verification\n   procedures,\
    \ as well as other operational rules it abides by,\n   \"visible\" through a certificate\
    \ policy, which may be referenced by a\n   certificate policies extension in the\
    \ PKC.\n   The purpose of this document is to define an Attribute Certificate\n\
    \   (AC) policies extension able to explicitly state the AC policies that\n  \
    \ apply to a given AC, but not the AC policies themselves.  Attribute\n   Certificates\
    \ are defined in [RFC3281].\n"

- title: 2.  AC Policies Extension Semantics
  contents:
  - "2.  AC Policies Extension Semantics\n   An Attribute Certificate Policy is a\
    \ named set of rules that\n   indicates the applicability of an AC to a particular\
    \ community and/or\n   class of applications with common security requirements.\
    \  It defines\n   rules for the generation, issuance, and revocation of ACs. \
    \ It may\n   also include additional rules for attributes registration.\n   Thus,\
    \ note that an Attribute Authority (AA) does not necessarily\n   support one single\
    \ ACP.  However, for each AC that is delivered, the\n   AA SHALL make sure that\
    \ the policy applies to all the attributes that\n   are contained in it.\n   An\
    \ ACP may be used by an AC user to decide whether or not to trust\n   the attributes\
    \ contained in an AC for a particular purpose.\n   When an AC contains an AC policies\
    \ extension, the extension MAY, at\n   the option of the AA, be either critical\
    \ or non-critical.\n   The AC Policies extension MAY be included in an AC.  Like\
    \ all X.509\n   certificate extensions [X.509], the AC policies extension is defined\n\
    \   using ASN.1 [ASN1].  See Appendix A.\n   The definitions are presented in\
    \ the 1988 Abstract Syntax Notation\n   One (ASN.1) rather than the 1997 ASN.1\
    \ syntax used in the most recent\n   ISO/IEC/ITU-T standards.\n   The AC policies\
    \ extension is identified by id-pe-acPolicies.\n      id-pe-acPolicies OBJECT\
    \ IDENTIFIER ::= { iso(1)\n        identified-organization(3) dod(6) internet(1)\
    \ security(5)\n        mechanisms(5) id-pkix(7) id-pe(1) 15 }\n   The AC policies\
    \ extension includes a list of AC policies recognized\n   by the AA that apply\
    \ to the attributes included in the AC.\n   AC Policies may be defined by any\
    \ organization with a need.  Object\n   identifiers used to identify AC Policies\
    \ are assigned in accordance\n   with [X.660|ISO9834-1].\n   The AC policies extension\
    \ in an AC indicates the AC policies for\n   which the AC is valid.\n   An application\
    \ that recognizes this extension and its content SHALL\n   process the extension\
    \ regardless of the value of the criticality\n   flag.\n   If the extension is\
    \ both flagged non-critical and not recognized by\n   the AC-using application,\
    \ then the application MAY ignore it.\n   If the extension is marked critical\
    \ or is recognized by the AC-using\n   application, it indicates that the attributes\
    \ contained in the\n   attribute certificate SHALL only be used for the purpose,\
    \ and in\n   accordance with the rules associated with one of the indicated AC\n\
    \   policies.  If none of the ACP identifiers is adequate for the\n   application,\
    \ then the AC MUST be rejected.\n   If the extension is marked critical or is\
    \ recognized by the AC using\n   application, the AC-using application MUST use\
    \ the list of AC\n   policies to determine whether it is appropriate to use the\
    \ attributes\n   contained in that AC for a particular transaction.  When the\n\
    \   appropriate policy is not found, the AC SHALL be rejected.\n"

- title: 2.1.1.  Notice Qualifiers
  contents:
  - "2.1.1.  Notice Qualifiers\n   The ACPS Pointer qualifier contains a pointer to\
    \ an Attribute\n   Certification Practice Statement (ACPS) published by the AA.\
    \  The\n   pointer is in the form of a URI.  Processing requirements for this\n\
    \   qualifier are a local matter.\n   The AC User Notice is intended for display\
    \ to a relying party when an\n   attribute certificate is used.  The application\
    \ software SHOULD\n   display the AC User Notice of the AC.  The AC User Notice\
    \ is defined\n   in [RFC3280].  It has two optional fields: the noticeRef field\
    \ and\n   the explicitText field.\n      The noticeRef field, if used, names an\
    \ organization and\n      identifies, by number, a particular textual statement\
    \ prepared by\n      that organization.  For example, it might identify the\n\
    \      organization's name and notice number 1.  In a typical\n      implementation,\
    \ the application software will have a notice file\n      containing the current\
    \ set of notices for the AA; the application\n      will extract the notice text\
    \ from the file and display it.\n      Messages MAY be multilingual, allowing\
    \ the software to select the\n      particular language message for its own environment.\n\
    \      An explicitText field includes the textual statement directly in\n    \
    \  the certificate.  The explicitText field is a string with a\n      maximum\
    \ size of 200 characters.\n   If both the noticeRef and explicitText options are\
    \ included in the\n   one qualifier, and if the application software can locate\
    \ the notice\n   text indicated by the noticeRef option, then that text SHOULD\
    \ be\n   displayed; otherwise, the explicitText string SHOULD be displayed.\n"

  contents:
  - "2.2.  Attribute Certificate Policies\n   The scope of this document is not the\
    \ definition of the detailed\n   content of ACPs themselves; therefore, specific\
    \ policies are not\n   defined in this document.\n"
- title: 3.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "3.  Security Considerations\n   The ACP defined in this document applies for\
    \ all the attributes that\n   are included in one AC.  AAs SHALL ensure that the\
    \ ACP applies to all\n   the attributes that are included in the ACs they issue.\n\
    \   Attributes may be dynamically grouped in several ACs.  It should be\n   observed\
    \ that since an AC may be issued under more than one ACP, the\n   attributes included\
    \ in a given AC MUST be compliant with all the ACPs\n   from that AC.\n   When\
    \ verifying an AC, a relying party MUST determine that the AC was\n   issued by\
    \ a trusted AA and then that it has the appropriate policy.\n   Failure of AAs\
    \ to protect their private keys will permit an attacker\n   to masquerade as them,\
    \ potentially generating false ACs or revocation\n   status.  Existence of bogus\
    \ ACs and revocation status will undermine\n   confidence in the system.  If the\
    \ compromise is detected, then the\n   certificate of the AA MUST be revoked.\n\
    \   Rebuilding after such a compromise will be problematic, so AAs are\n   advised\
    \ to implement a combination of strong technical measures\n   (e.g., tamper-resistant\
    \ cryptographic modules) and appropriate\n   management procedures (e.g., separation\
    \ of duties) to avoid such an\n   incident.\n   Loss of an AA's private signing\
    \ key may also be problematic.  The AA\n   would not be able to produce revocation\
    \ status or perform AC renewal\n   (i.e., the issue of a new AC with the same\
    \ set of attributes with the\n   same values, for the same holder, from the same\
    \ AA but with a\n   different validity period).  AC issuers are advised to maintain\n\
    \   secure backup for signing keys.  The security of the key backup\n   procedures\
    \ is a critical factor in avoiding key compromise.\n   The availability and freshness\
    \ of revocation status will affect the\n   degree of assurance that should be\
    \ placed in a long-lived AC.  While\n   long-lived ACs expire naturally, events\
    \ may occur during an AC's\n   natural lifetime that negate the binding between\
    \ the AC holder and\n   the attributes.  If revocation status is untimely or unavailable,\
    \ the\n   assurance associated with the binding is clearly reduced.\n   The binding\
    \ between an AC holder and attributes cannot be stronger\n   than the cryptographic\
    \ module implementation and algorithms used to\n   generate the signature.  Short\
    \ key lengths or weak hash algorithms\n   will limit the utility of an AC.  AAs\
    \ are encouraged to note advances\n   in cryptology so they can employ strong\
    \ cryptographic techniques.\n   If an AC is tied to the holder's PKC using the\
    \ baseCertificateID\n   component of the Holder field and the PKI in use includes\
    \ a rogue CA\n   with the same issuer name specified in the baseCertificateID\n\
    \   component, this rogue CA could issue a PKC to a malicious party,\n   using\
    \ the same issuer name and serial number as the proper holder's\n   PKC.  Then\
    \ the malicious party could use this PKC in conjunction with\n   the AC.  This\
    \ scenario SHOULD be avoided by properly managing and\n   configuring the PKI\
    \ so that there cannot be two CAs with the same\n   name.  Another alternative\
    \ is to tie ACs to PKCs using the\n   publicKeyCert type in the ObjectDigestInfo\
    \ field.  Failing this, AC\n   verifiers have to establish (using other means)\
    \ that the potential\n   collisions cannot actually occur; for example, the Certificate\
    \ Policy\n   Statements (CPSs) of the CAs involved may make it clear that no such\n\
    \   name collisions can occur.\n   Implementers MUST ensure that following validation\
    \ of an AC, only\n   attributes that the issuer is trusted to issue are used in\n\
    \   authorization decisions.  Other attributes, which MAY be present,\n   MUST\
    \ be ignored.  AC verifiers SHALL support means of being provided\n   with this\
    \ information.  The AA controls PKC extension (see [RFC3281])\n   is one possibility,\
    \ but it is optional to implement.  Configuration\n   information is a likely\
    \ alternative means, while out-of-band means is\n   another.  This becomes very\
    \ important if an AC verification\n   application trusts more than one AC issuer.\n"
