  - "Abstract\n   Multihoming technology improves the availability of host and network\n\
    \   connectivity.  Since the behaviors of fixed and mobile networks\n   differ,\
    \ distinct architectures for each have been discussed and\n   proposed.  This\
    \ document proposes a common architecture for both\n   mobile and fixed networking\
    \ environments, using mobile IP (RFC 3775)\n   and Network Mobility (NEMO; RFC\
    \ 3963).  The proposed architecture\n   requires a modification of mobile IP and\
    \ NEMO so that multiple Care-\n   of Addresses (CoAs) can be used.  In addition,\
    \ multiple Home Agents\n   (HAs) that are located in different places are required\

  contents:
  - "1.2.  Problems to be Solved to Accomplish Multihoming\n   Several multihoming\
    \ technologies have been proposed so far.\n   Conventional major multihoming networks\
    \ use BGP, but it has some\n   issues, as follows.\n   (1) Increasing route entries\
    \ in the Internet\n      In the multihoming environments, each user's network\
    \ needs to\n      advertise its address block to all ISPs connected to them. \
    \ If a\n      multihomed user connects to only one ISP, the ISP can advertise\n\
    \      routing information to aggregate them.  But some multihomed users\n   \
    \   need to connect with different ISPs to be prepared for ISP\n      failure.\
    \  In this case, ISPs need to advertise routing information\n      for multihomed\
    \ users without aggregation.  Therefore, the number\n      of routing entries\
    \ in the Internet is increasing one by one.\n   (2) Difficulty of using multiple\
    \ links efficiently\n      It is not easy to control incoming traffic in the case\
    \ of the\n      conventional multihoming architecture using BGP.  Therefore, load\n\

  - "1.3.  Using the Architecture of Mobile IP and NEMO to Solve the Problems\n  \
    \ Basically, mobile IP (MIP) and NEMO have been proposed for mobile\n   hosts\
    \ or mobile networks; however, their architecture and protocol\n   can be used\
    \ for fixed networks and to solve the problems mentioned\n   above.  The details\
    \ of the solution are described in the sections\n   below.\n   Moreover, by using\
    \ the architecture and the protocol of MIP and the\n   NEMO, the cost of network\
    \ operation will be decreased.  For instance,\n   in the architecture of MIP and\
    \ NEMO, renumbering IP addresses when\n   office or network equipment is relocated\
    \ becomes unnecessary, as the\n   network address prefix used by a user network\
    \ in a mobile IP\n   environment does not depend on the upstream ISP's network\
    \ prefix.\n"

  contents:
  - "2.1.  Mobile Network Includes Fixed Network\n   By their nature, NEMO and mobile\
    \ IP must work with multihoming.  This\n   is because mobile nodes need to use\
    \ multiple links to improve the\n   availability of network connectivity since\
    \ the wireless link is not\n   always stable.  Therefore, we propose that multihoming\

    \  Furthermore, NEMO protocols\n   meet the requirements of the proposed architecture\
    \ in this document,\n   which are:\n   o  The protocol can be used by the MR to\
    \ send information such as the\n      CoA, Home Address (HoA), and Binding Unique\
    \ Identifier (BID) [4]\n      to the HA.\n   o  The protocol can establish multiple\

    \ can synchronize Binding\n      Caches among multiple HAs.\n   The proposed multihomed\
    \ architecture uses NEMO protocols as one of\n   the applications of NEMO.  Needless\
    \ to say, using the NEMO protocol\n   is one of the solutions to accomplish the\
    \ proposed multihome\n   architecture.  Another solution is to propose a new protocol\

  - "4.2.  Route Announcement from Geographically Distributed Multiple HAs\n   In\
    \ the proposed architecture, the xSP (Multihomed Service Provider)\n   is introduced.\
    \  The xSP is a conceptual service provider; it doesn't\n   have to be connected\
    \ to the Internet physically for all practical\n   purposes.  xSP has one or more\
    \ aggregatable mobile network prefixes.\n   xSP contracts with some ISPs that\
    \ are physically connected to the\n   Internet.  The purpose of this contract\
    \ is to set up some HAs in\n   those ISPs' networks.  Those HAs announce the xSP's\
    \ aggregated mobile\n   network prefixes.  This means that HAs work just like\
    \ border gateway\n   routers, and this situation is the same as peering between\
    \ the ISP\n   and xSP.  In this case, the origin Autonomous System (AS) announced\n\
    \   from the HAs is the xSP.\n   On the other hand, a multihomed user (a small\
    \ office user or home\n   user) contracts with the xSP to acquire a mobile network\
    \ prefix from\n   the xSP.  Each multihomed user has an MR and multiple L3 connectivity\n\
    \   to the Internet via multiple ISPs, and the MR will establish multiple\n  \
    \ tunnels to the HA.  Since the user's mobile network prefixes are\n   aggregated\
    \ and announced from the HA, the packets to the user's\n   mobile network will\
    \ be sent to the nearest HA depending on global\n   routing information at that\
    \ time.  The HA that received such packets\n   will forward them to the user's\
    \ network over the established multiple\n   tunnels.\n   This model of route announcement\
    \ from multiple HAs is compatible with\n   the conventional scalable Internet\
    \ architecture, and it doesn't have\n   scalability problems.\n"
