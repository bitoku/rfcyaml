  - "1.  Introduction\n   Multiple Access Protocol over SONET/SDH (MAPOS) [1][2] is\
    \ a high-\n   speed link-layer protocol that provides multiple access capability\n\
    \   over SONET/SDH.  Its frame format is based on the HDLC-like (High\n   Level\
    \ Data Link Control) framing [3] for PPP.  A component called a\n   \"Frame Switch\"\
    \ [1] allows multiple nodes (hosts and routers) to be\n   connected together in\
    \ a star topology to form a LAN.  Using long-haul\n   SONET/SDH links, the nodes\
    \ on such a \"SONET-LAN\" can span a wide\n   geographical area.\n   This document\
    \ specifies the frame format for encapsulating an\n   Internet Protocol version\
    \ 6 (IPv6) [4] datagram in a MAPOS frame, the\n   method of forming IPv6 interface\
    \ identifiers, the method of detecting\n   duplicate addresses, and the format\
    \ of the Source/Target Link-layer\n   Addresses option field used in Neighbor\
    \ Discovery messages such as\n   Router Solicitation, Router Advertisement, Neighbor\
    \ Solicitation,\n   Neighbor Advertisement, and Redirect messages.\n   In the\
    \ remainder of this document, the term \"MAPOS\" is used unless\n   the distinction\
    \ between MAPOS version 1 [1] and MAPOS 16 [2] is\n   required.\n"

  contents:
  - "2.1.  Frame Format\n   MAPOS uses the same HDLC-like framing as PPP-over-SONET,\
    \ described in\n   [3].  The MAPOS frame begins and ends with a flag sequence\
    \ 01111110\n   (0x7E), and the MAPOS frame header contains address, control, and\n\
    \   protocol fields.  The address field contains a destination HDLC\n   address.\
    \  In MAPOS 16, the address field is extended to 16 bits, and\n   the control\
    \ field of MAPOS version 1 is omitted.  The frame check\n   sequence (FCS) field\
    \ is 16 bits long by default, but a 32-bit FCS may\n   be used optionally.  Details\
    \ of the MAPOS frame format are described\n   in [1][2].\n   An IPv6 datagram\
    \ is encapsulated in the MAPOS frame.  In the case of\n   encapsulating an IPv6\
    \ datagram, the protocol field must contain the\n   value 0x0057 (hexadecimal).\
    \  The IPv6 datagram is stored in the\n   information field which follows immediately\
    \ after the protocol field.\n   That is, this field contains the IPv6 header followed\
    \ immediately by\n   the payload.  Figure 1 shows the frame format.  The fields\
    \ are\n   transmitted from left to right.\n   +----------+----------+----------+----------+\n\

    \ [1][2].  The default\n   maximum transmission unit (MTU) is 65,280 octets.\n\
    \   However, the MTU size may be reduced by a Router Advertisement [5]\n   containing\
    \ an MTU option that specifies a smaller MTU, or by manual\n   configuration of\
    \ each node.  If a Router Advertisement received on a\n   MAPOS interface has\
    \ an MTU option specifying an MTU larger than\n   65,280, or larger than a manually\

- title: 3.  Interface Identifier
  contents:
  - "3.  Interface Identifier\n   This section specifies the method of forming the\
    \ interface identifier\n   [7].\n   A node that has one or more MAPOS interfaces\
    \ must create one or more\n   EUI-64 [8] based interface identifiers.  Here, it\
    \ should be noted\n   that deriving interface identifiers from HDLC addresses\
    \ of MAPOS\n   interfaces is undesirable for the following reasons.\n   1. When\
    \ a node is connected to a frame switch, an HDLC address is\n      assigned to\
    \ the interface of the node from the frame switch via\n      NSP [6].  (In the\
    \ remainder of this document, the term \"MAPOS\n      address\" is used to refer\
    \ to the address.)  The value of the MAPOS\n      address assigned to the interface\
    \ depends on the combination of\n      the switch number of the frame switch and\
    \ the port number of the\n      frame switch to which the interface is connected.\
    \  The switch\n      number is required to be unique only within a MAPOS multi-switch\n\
    \      environment [6]; that is, there can be frame switches that have\n     \
    \ the same switch number in different MAPOS multi-switch environment\n      separated\
    \ by IP routers.  Therefore, the uniqueness of a MAPOS\n      address is guaranteed\
    \ only within a MAPOS multi-switch\n      environment.\n      Furthermore, if\
    \ an implementation ensures that the link between\n      the interface of the\
    \ node and the port of the frame switch is\n      hot-swappable, the port number\
    \ of the frame switch or the frame\n      switch connected to the interface of\
    \ the node can be changed, so\n      the MAPOS address assigned to the interface\
    \ can also be changed\n      without performing a system re-start of the node.\n\
    \      In short, the global uniqueness of a MAPOS address is not\n      guaranteed,\
    \ and a MAPOS address is not a built-in address but can\n      be changed without\
    \ performing a system re-start.  Thus, if an\n      interface identifier were\
    \ derived from a MAPOS address, it could\n      also be changed without a system\
    \ re-start.  This would not follow\n      the recommendation in [7].\n   2. In\
    \ the case of a point-to-point connection between two nodes, the\n      same MAPOS\
    \ address is assigned to each interface.  Specifically,\n      in the case of\
    \ MAPOS version 1, the assigned address is 0x03 [6],\n      and in the case of\
    \ MAPOS 16, the assigned address is 0x0003 [2].\n      It is not easy to achieve\
    \ link-locality of the interface\n      identifier in a strict manner using the\
    \ same Link-layer address.\n      For the above reasons, nodes with MAPOS interfaces\
    \ must not derive\n      their interface identifiers from their MAPOS addresses.\n\
    \      The following are methods of forming an interface identifier in\n     \
    \ the order of preference.  These are almost the same as the methods\n      described\
    \ in [9] except that a MAPOS address must not be used as a\n      source of uniqueness\
    \ when an IEEE global identifier is\n      unavailable.\n   1) If an IEEE global\
    \ identifier (EUI-48 or EUI-64) is available\n      anywhere on the node, it should\
    \ be used to construct the interface\n      identifier due to its uniqueness.\
    \  When extracting an IEEE global\n      identifier from another device on the\
    \ node, care should be taken\n      to ensure that the extracted identifier is\
    \ presented in canonical\n      ordering [10].\n      The only transformation\
    \ from an EUI-64 identifier is to invert the\n      \"u\" bit (universal/local\
    \ bit in IEEE EUI-64 terminology).  For\n      example, for a globally unique\
    \ EUI-64 identifier as shown in\n      Figure 4:\n   MSB                     \

  - "6.  Security Considerations\n   In MAPOS, a link-layer address (MAPOS address)\
    \ is assigned to a\n   network interface by a frame switch via NSP; unlike other\
    \ link-layer\n   protocols such as Ethernet that use a built-in address on a network\n\
    \   interface.  Security considerations derived from this are described\n   in\
    \ 6.1 and 6.2.  Because there is no link-layer security in MAPOS,\n   the same\
    \ security considerations as those of other link-layer\n   protocols would be\
    \ applied to other points.\n"

- title: 6.1.1.  Protection against fraudulent reception of traffic
  contents:
  - "6.1.1.  Protection against fraudulent reception of traffic\n   In MAPOS, a MAPOS\
    \ address is assigned by a frame switch, and it\n   consists of the switch number\
    \ and the port number of the switch to\n   which the network interface is connected.\
    \  (In the case of a point-\n   to-point connection between two nodes, a fixed\
    \ address is assigned to\n   their network interfaces.)  This brings the following\
    \ advantages.\n   1. The value of the MAPOS address of a MAPOS network interface\n\
    \      indicates the location of the interface in the MAPOS network.  In\n   \
    \   other words, the value itself of the destination address of a\n      MAPOS\
    \ frame defines the actual location of the network interface\n      to which the\
    \ frame should be finally delivered.  Therefore, as\n      long as MAPOS addresses\
    \ of network interfaces of nodes that have\n      been connected to the network\
    \ through proper administrative\n      process are held and frames are delivered\
    \ only to those addresses,\n      other nodes cannot receive frames unless their\
    \ network interfaces\n      are connected to the same ports of frame switches\
    \ as those to\n      which network interfaces of properly administered nodes are\n\
    \      connected. This makes fraudulent reception of traffic difficult.\n   2.\
    \ In the case where MAPOS addresses are not administered as\n      mentioned above,\
    \ it is possible that a malicious node could hijack\n      traffic by spoofing\
    \ its IPv6 address in a response to an IPv6\n      Neighbor Discovery.  Even in\
    \ this case, the node must advertise\n      the true MAPOS address of its network\
    \ interface in the response so\n      that it can receive successive frames. \
    \ This makes it easy to\n      pinpoint the location of the host.\n"
- title: 6.1.2.  Protection against improper traffic
  contents:
  - "6.1.2.  Protection against improper traffic\n   A MAPOS frame does not have a\
    \ field for including its sender's\n   address.  Therefore, in the case where\
    \ a node sends one-way improper\n   traffic maliciously or accidentally, there\
    \ is no way to obtain the\n   sender's MAPOS address from the traffic and this\
    \ leads to difficulty\n   in identifying the node (because source IP addresses\
    \ might be\n   forged).\n   An effective way to alleviate the difficulty is to\
    \ moderate the size\n   of MAPOS multi-switch environment [6].  A common approach\
    \ is to\n   separate it using IP routers.  This makes it easy to identify the\n\
    \   node sending improper traffic within the multi-switch environment.\n   To\
    \ secure the environment against improper traffic from outside it,\n   boundary\
    \ IP routers need to block it using packet filtering based on\n   IP layer information.\n"
- title: 6.2.  Uniqueness of Interface Identifiers
  contents:
  - "6.2.  Uniqueness of Interface Identifiers\n   Global uniqueness of a MAPOS address\
    \ is not guaranteed, and a MAPOS\n   address is not a built-in address but can\
    \ be changed without\n   performing a system re-start if an implementation ensures\
    \ that the\n   link between the network interface of the node and the port of\
    \ the\n   frame switch is hot-swappable.  Thus, an interface identifier must\n\
    \   not be derived from a MAPOS address in order to ensure that the\n   interface\
    \ identifier is not changed without a system re-start.\n   As a consequence, in\
    \ IP Version 6 over MAPOS, the existence of\n   network interfaces other than\
    \ MAPOS that have IEEE global identifier\n   based addresses has great importance\
    \ in creating interface\n   identifiers.  However, it may be common for there\
    \ to be no such\n   interfaces on a node, so a different source of uniqueness\
    \ must be\n   used.  Therefore, sufficient care should be taken to prevent\n \
    \  duplication of interface identifiers.  At present, there is no\n   protection\
    \ against duplication through accident or forgery.\n"
