  - "1.  Introduction\n   This document describes methods for carrying PostScript
    information\n   in the two standard mail systems MIME and X.400, and the conversion\n
    \  between them. It uses the notational conventions of [BODYMAP], and\n   the
    conversion is further described in [MIXER].\n   Two ways of carrying PostScript
    in X.400 are described.  One is using\n   the FTAM Body Part, and one uses the
    Extended Body Part originally\n   described in RFC 1494.\n   The FTAM method is
    recommended.\n"
  title: 1.  Introduction

  - "2.  The PostScript body part\n   Carrying PostScript in X.400 as an Extended
    Body Part was originally\n   defined in RFC 1494.  This specification carries
    that work forward\n   now that RFC 1494 is obsoleted by [BODYMAP].\n   The following
    Extended Body Part is defined for PostScript data\n   streams.  It has no parameters.\n
    \     postscript-body-part EXTENDED-BODY-PART-TYPE\n        DATA             OCTET
    STRING\n        ::= mime-postscript-body\n      mime-postscript-body OBJECT IDENTIFIER
    ::=\n                { mixer-bp-data 2 }\n"
  title: 2.  The PostScript body part
- contents:
  - "3.  The PostScript FTBP\n   The PostScript FTBP is identified by having the\n
    \  FileTransferParameters.environment.application-reference set to id-\n   mime-ftbp-postscript.\n
    \  The definition is:\n    id-mime-ftbp-postscript OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::=\n                       {
    mixer-bp-data 6 }\n"

  - "4.  The Application/PostScript content-type\n   In MIME, PostScript is carried
    in the body part\n   \"application/PostScript\", which is defined in RFC 1521.\n"

- contents:
  - "5.  MIXER conversion\n   X.400 Body Part: Extended Body Part, OID mime-postscript-body
    MIME\n   Content-Type: application/postscript Conversion Type: No conversion\n
    \  The two representations of PostScript both contain a single stream of\n   octets.
    This stream of octets can be copied with no problems between\n   the representations.
    No other data needs to be converted.\n"
