  - "1.  Introduction\n   A textual representation for Autonomous System (AS) numbers\
    \ is\n   defined as the decimal value of the AS number.  This textual\n   representation\
    \ is to be used by all documents, systems, and user\n   interfaces referring to\
    \ AS numbers.\n   This document notes a number of potential representation formats\
    \ and\n   proposes the adoption of a decimal value notation for AS numbers, or\n\
    \   \"asplain\" according to the representation taxonomy described here.\n"
- title: 2.  Taxonomy of Representation Formats
  contents:
  - "2.  Taxonomy of Representation Formats\n   A taxonomy of representation for AS\
    \ numbers is as follows:\n   asplain\n      refers to a syntax scheme of representing\
    \ all AS numbers using\n      decimal integer notation.  Using asplain notation,\
    \ an AS number of\n      value 65526 would be represented as the string \"65526\"\
    \ and an AS\n      number of value 65546 would be represented as the string \"\
    65546\".\n   asdot+\n      refers to a syntax scheme of representing all AS numbers\
    \ using a\n      notation of two integer values joined by a period character:\
    \ <high\n      order 16-bit value in decimal>.<low order 16-bit value in\n   \
    \   decimal>.  Using asdot+ notation, an AS number of value 65526\n      would\
    \ be represented as the string \"0.65526\" and an AS number of\n      value 65546\
    \ would be represented as the string \"1.10\".\n   asdot\n      refers to a syntax\
    \ scheme of representing AS number values less\n      than 65536 using asplain\
    \ notation and representing AS number\n      values equal to or greater than 65536\
    \ using asdot+ notation.\n      Using asdot notation, an AS number of value 65526\
    \ would be\n      represented as the string \"65526\" and an AS number of value\
    \ 65546\n      would be represented as the string \"1.10\".\n"
- title: 3.  Representation of AS Number Values
  contents:
  - "3.  Representation of AS Number Values\n   To avoid confusion, a single textual\
    \ notation is useful for\n   documentation, configuration systems, reports, and\
    \ external tools and\n   information repositories.  The decimal value representation,\
    \ or\n   \"asplain\" is proposed as the textual notation to use for AS numbers.\n\
    \   The \"asplain\" representation represents the number as its decimal\n   value,\
    \ without any field delimiter, corresponding to the lack of any\n   internal structure\
    \ required by the use of AS numbers in the inter-\n   domain routing context.\n"
- title: 4.  IANA Considerations
  contents:
  - "4.  IANA Considerations\n   IANA Registries should use decimal representation\
    \ (\"asplain\") for AS\n   numbers.\n"
- title: 5.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "5.  Security Considerations\n   This document does not refer to matters associated\
    \ with security of\n   routing systems.\n"
- title: 6.  Acknowledgments
  contents:
  - "6.  Acknowledgments\n   The terminology of \"asplain\", \"asdot\", and \"asdot+\"\
    \ was originally\n   devised and described by Juergen Kammer in January 2007 [KAMMER2007].\n"
