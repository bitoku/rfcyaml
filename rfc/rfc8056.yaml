  - "1.  Introduction\n   This document maps the statuses defined in the Extensible\n\
    \   Provisioning Protocol (EPP) RFCs to the list of statuses registered\n   for\
    \ use in the Registration Data Access Protocol (RDAP), in the \"RDAP\n   JSON\
    \ Values\" registry [rdap-json-values].\n   The \"RDAP JSON Values\" registry\
    \ is described in Section 10.2 of\n   [RFC7483] and is available in the \"RDAP\
    \ JSON Values\" registry\n   [rdap-json-values].\n   The EPP statuses used as\
    \ the source of the mapping include\n   Section 2.3 of the Extensible Provisioning\
    \ Protocol (EPP) Domain Name\n   Mapping [RFC5731], Section 2.3 of \"Extensible\
    \ Provisioning Protocol\n   (EPP) Host Mapping\" [RFC5732], Section 2.2 of \"\
    Extensible\n   Provisioning Protocol (EPP) Contact Mapping\" [RFC5733], and\n\
    \   Section 3.1 of \"Domain Registry Grace Period Mapping for the\n   Extensible\
    \ Provisioning Protocol (EPP)\" [RFC3915].\n   Each EPP status MUST map to a single\
    \ RDAP status to ensure that data\n   in the Domain Name Registries (DNRs) that\
    \ use EPP can be accurately\n   presented in RDAP.\n"

  - "2.  EPP-to-RDAP Status Mapping\n   Below is a list of EPP statuses from the EPP\
    \ RFCs ([RFC5731],\n   [RFC5732], [RFC5733], and [RFC3915]) mapped to the RDAP\
    \ statuses\n   registered in the \"RDAP JSON Values\" registry [rdap-json-values],\n\

    \ =\n   The \"RDAP JSON Values\" registry [rdap-json-values] does have a set of\n\
    \   prohibited statuses including \"renew prohibited\", \"update\n   prohibited\"\
    , \"transfer prohibited\", and \"delete prohibited\", but\n   these statuses do\
    \ not directly map to the EPP prohibited statuses.\n   EPP provides status codes\
    \ that allow distinguishing the case that an\n   action is prohibited because\
    \ of server policy from the case that an\n   action is prohibited because of a\
    \ client request.  The ability to\n   make this distinction needs to be preserved\
    \ in RDAP.\n   Each of the EPP status values that don't map directly to an RDAP\n\
    \   status value is described below.  Each EPP status value includes a\n   proposed\
    \ new RDAP status value and a description of the value.  The\n   RDAP status value\

    \ period expires and is extended\n       (renewed) automatically by the server.\
