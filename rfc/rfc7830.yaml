- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   The Domain Name System (DNS) [RFC1035] was specified to\
    \ transport DNS\n   messages in cleartext form.  Since this can expose significant\n\
    \   amounts of information about the Internet activities of an end user,\n   the\
    \ IETF has undertaken work to provide confidentiality to DNS\n   transactions\
    \ (see the DPRIVE working group).  Encrypting the DNS\n   transport is considered\
    \ one of the options to improve the situation.\n   However, even if both DNS query\
    \ and response messages were encrypted,\n   metadata could still be used to correlate\
    \ such messages with well-\n   known unencrypted messages, hence jeopardizing\
    \ some of the\n   confidentiality gained by encryption.  One such property is\
    \ the\n   message size.\n   This document specifies the Extensions Mechanisms\
    \ for DNS (EDNS(0))\n   \"Padding\" option, which allows DNS clients and servers\
    \ to\n   artificially increase the size of a DNS message by a variable number\n\
    \   of bytes, hampering size-based correlation of the encrypted message.\n"
- title: 2.  Terminology
  contents:
  - "2.  Terminology\n   The terms \"Requestor\" and \"Responder\" are to be interpreted\
    \ as\n   specified in [RFC6891].\n   The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"\
    REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\"\
    , \"NOT RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and\n   \"OPTIONAL\" in this document are to be\
    \ interpreted as described in\n   [RFC2119].\n"
- title: 3.  The "Padding" Option
  contents:
  - "3.  The \"Padding\" Option\n   The EDNS(0) [RFC6891] specifies a mechanism to\
    \ include new options in\n   DNS packets, contained in the RDATA of the OPT meta-RR.\
    \  This\n   document specifies the \"Padding\" option in order to allow clients\
    \ and\n   servers to pad DNS packets by a variable number of bytes.  The\n   \"\
    Padding\" option MUST occur at most, once per OPT meta-RR (and hence,\n   at most\
    \ once per message).\n   The figure below specifies the structure of the option\
    \ in the RDATA\n   of the OPT RR:\n                0                       8 \
    \                     16\n                +--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+\n\
    \                |                  OPTION-CODE                  |\n         \
    \       +--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+\n                | \
    \                OPTION-LENGTH                 |\n                +--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+\n\
    \                |        (PADDING) ...        (PADDING) ...     /\n         \
    \       +-  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -\n                    \
    \             Figure 1\n   The OPTION-CODE for the \"Padding\" option is 12.\n\
    \   The OPTION-LENGTH for the \"Padding\" option is the size (in octets) of\n\
    \   the PADDING.  The minimum number of PADDING octets is 0.\n   The PADDING octets\
    \ SHOULD be set to 0x00.  Other values MAY be used,\n   for example, in cases\
    \ where there is a concern that the padded\n   message could be subject to compression\
    \ before encryption.  PADDING\n   octets of any value MUST be accepted in the\
    \ messages received.\n"
- title: 4.  Usage Considerations
  contents:
  - "4.  Usage Considerations\n   This document does not specify the actual amount\
    \ of padding to be\n   used, since this depends on the situation in which the\
    \ option is\n   used.  However, padded DNS messages MUST NOT exceed the number\
    \ of\n   octets specified in the Requestor's Payload Size field encoded in the\n\
    \   RR Class Field (see Sections 6.2.3 and 6.2.4 of [RFC6891]).\n   Responders\
    \ MUST pad DNS responses when the respective DNS query\n   included the \"Padding\"\
    \ option, unless doing so would violate the\n   maximum UDP payload size.\n  \
    \ Responders MAY pad DNS responses when the respective DNS query\n   indicated\
    \ EDNS(0) support of the Requestor and the \"Padding\" option\n   was not included.\n\
    \   Responders MUST NOT pad DNS responses when the respective DNS query\n   did\
    \ not indicate EDNS(0) support.\n"
- title: 5.  IANA Considerations
  contents:
  - "5.  IANA Considerations\n   IANA has assigned Option Code 12 for \"Padding\"\
    \ in the \"DNS EDNS0\n   Option Codes (OPT)\" registry.\n   IANA has updated the\
    \ respective registration record by changing the\n   Reference field to RFC 7830\
    \ and the Status field to \"Standard\".\n"
- title: 6.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "6.  Security Considerations\n   Padding DNS packets obviously increases their\
    \ size, and will\n   therefore lead to increased traffic.\n   The use of the EDNS(0)\
    \ padding only provides a benefit when DNS\n   packets are not transported in\
    \ cleartext.  Further, it is possible\n   that EDNS(0) padding may make DNS amplification\
    \ attacks easier.\n   Therefore, implementations MUST NOT use this option if the\
    \ DNS\n   transport is not encrypted.\n   Padding length might be affected by\
    \ lower-level compression.\n   Therefore (as described in Section 3.3 of [RFC7525]),\
    \ implementations\n   and deployments SHOULD disable compression at the Transport\
    \ Layer\n   Security (TLS) level.\n   The payload of the \"Padding\" option could\
    \ (like many other fields in\n   the DNS protocol) be used as a covert channel.\n"
