  - "1. Introduction\n   This document is intended to provide methodology for the\
    \ benchmarking\n   of local area network (LAN) switching devices.  It extends\
    \ the\n   methodology already defined for benchmarking network interconnecting\n\
    \   devices in RFC 2544 [3] to switching devices.\n   This RFC primarily deals\
    \ with devices which switch frames at the\n   Medium Access Control (MAC) layer.\
    \ It provides a methodology for\n   benchmarking switching devices, forwarding\
    \ performance, congestion\n   control, latency, address handling and filtering.\
    \ In addition to\n   defining the tests, this document also describes specific\
    \ formats for\n   reporting the results of the tests.\n   A previous document,\
    \ \"Benchmarking Terminology for LAN Switching\n   Devices\" [2], defined many\
    \ of the terms that are used in this\n   document.  The terminology document SHOULD\
    \ be consulted before\n   attempting to make use of this document.\n"
- title: 2. Requirements
  contents:
  - "2. Requirements\n   The following RFCs SHOULD be consulted before attempting\
    \ to make use\n   of this document: RFC 1242 [1], RFC 2285 [2], and RFC 2544 [3].\n\
    \   For the sake of clarity and continuity, this RFC adopts the template\n   for\
    \ benchmarking tests set out in Section 26 of RFC 2544.\n   The key words \"MUST\"\
    , \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD\
    \ NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\",  \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n   document are\
    \ to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.\n"
- title: 3. Test setup
  contents:
  - "3. Test setup\n   This document extends the general test setup described in section\
    \ 6\n   of RFC 2544 [3] to the benchmarking of LAN switching devices.  RFC\n \
    \  2544 [3] primarily describes non-meshed traffic where input and\n   output\
    \ interfaces  are grouped in mutually exclusive sending and\n   receiving pairs.\
    \  In fully meshed traffic, each interface of a\n   DUT/SUT is set up to both\
    \ receive and transmit frames to all the\n   other interfaces under test.\n  \
    \ Prior to each test run, the DUT/SUT MUST learn the MAC addresses used\n   in\
    \ the test and the address learning SHOULD be verified.  Addresses\n   not learned\
    \ will be forwarded as flooded frames and reduce the amount\n   of correctly forwarded\
    \ frames.  The rate at which address learning\n   frames are offered may have\
    \ to be adjusted to be as low as 50 frames\n   per second or even less, to guarantee\
    \ successful learning.  The\n   DUT/SUT address aging time SHOULD be configured\
    \ to be greater than\n   the period of the learning phase of the test plus the\
    \ trial duration\n   plus any configuration time required by the testing device.\n\
    \   Addresses SHOULD NOT age out until the trial duration is completed.\n   More\
    \ than one learning trial may be needed for the association of the\n   address\
    \ to the port to occur.\n   If a DUT/SUT uses a hashing algorithm with address\
    \ learning, the\n   DUT/SUT may not learn the necessary addresses to perform the\
    \ tests.\n   The format of the MAC addresses MUST be adjustable so that the\n\
    \   address mapping may be re-arranged to ensure that the DUT/SUT learns\n   all\
    \ the addresses.\n"
- title: 4.  Frame formats and sizes
  contents:
  - "4.  Frame formats and sizes\n   The test frame format is defined in RFC 2544\
    \ section 8 [3] and MUST\n   contain a unique signature field located in the UDP\
    \ DATA area of the\n   Test Frame (see Appendix C [3]).  The purpose of the signature\
    \ field\n   is filter out frames that are not part of the offered load.\n   The\
    \ signature field MUST be unique enough to identify the frames not\n   originating\
    \ from the DUT/SUT.  The signature field SHOULD be located\n   after byte 56 (collision\
    \ window [4] ) or at the end of the frame. The\n   length, contents and method\
    \ of detection is not defined in this memo.\n   The signature field MAY have a\
    \ unique identifier per port.  This\n   would filter out misforwarded frames.\
    \  It is possible for a DUT/SUT\n   to strip off the MAC layer, send it through\
    \ its switching matrix, and\n   transmit it out with the correct destination MAC\
    \ address but the\n   wrong payload.\n   For frame sizes, refer to RFC 2544, section\
    \ 9 [3].\n   There are three possible frame formats for layer 2 Ethernet switches:\n\
    \   standard MAC Ethernet frames, standard MAC Ethernet frames with\n   vendor-specific\
    \ tags added to them, and IEEE 802.3ac frames tagged to\n   accommodate 802.1p&Q.\
    \  The two types of tagged frames may exceed the\n   standard maximum length frame\
    \ of 1518 bytes, and may not be accepted\n   by the interface controllers of some\
    \ DUT/SUTs. It is recommended to\n   check the compatibility of the DUT/SUT with\
    \ tagged frames before\n   testing.\n   Devices switching tagged frames of over\
    \ 1518 bytes will have a\n   different maximum forwarding rate than untagged frames.\n"

- title: 5.1.2 Setup Parameters
  contents:
  - "5.1.2 Setup Parameters\n   When offering full meshed traffic, the following parameters\
    \ MUST be\n   defined.  Each parameter is configured with the following\n   considerations.\n\
    \      Frame Size - Recommended frame sizes are 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024,\n   \
    \   1280 and 1518 bytes, per RFC 2544 section 9 [3].  The four CRC\n      bytes\
    \ are included in the frame size specified.\n      Interframe Gap (IFG) - The\
    \ IFG between frames inside a burst MUST\n      be at the minimum specified by\
    \ the standard (9.6 us for 10Mbps\n      Ethernet, 960 ns for 100Mbps Ethernet,\
    \ and 96 ns for 1 Gbps\n      Ethernet) of the medium being tested.\n      Duplex\
    \ mode - Half duplex or full duplex.\n      ILoad - Intended Load per port is\
    \ expressed in a percentage of the\n      medium's maximum theoretical load, regardless\
    \ of traffic\n      orientation or duplex mode.  Certain test configurations will\n\
    \      theoretically over-subscribe the DUT/SUT.\n      In half duplex, an ILoad\
    \ over 50% will over-subscribe the DUT/SUT.\n      Burst Size - The burst size\
    \ defines the number of frames sent\n      back-to-back at the minimum legal IFG\
    \ [4] before pausing\n      transmission to receive frames.  Burst sizes SHOULD\
    \ vary between 1\n      and 930 frames.  A burst size of 1 will simulate constant\
    \ load\n      [1].\n      Addresses per port - Represents the number of addresses\
    \ which are\n      being tested for each port.  Number of addresses SHOULD be\
    \ a\n      binary exponential (i.e. 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, ...).\n\
    \      Recommended value is 1.\n      Trial Duration - The recommended Trial Duration\
    \ is 30 seconds.\n      Trial duration SHOULD be adjustable between 1 and 300\
    \ seconds.\n"
- title: 5.1.3 Procedure
  contents:
  - "5.1.3 Procedure\n   All ports on the tester MUST transmit test frames either\
    \ in a Frame\n   Based or Time Based mode (Appendix B).  All ports SHOULD start\n\
    \   transmitting their frames within 1% of the trial duration.  For a\n   trial\
    \ duration of 30 seconds, all ports SHOULD have started\n   transmitting frames\
    \ within 300 milliseconds of each other.\n   Each port in the test MUST send test\
    \ frames to all other ports in a\n   round robin type fashion.  The sequence of\
    \ addresses MUST NOT change\n   when congestion control is applied.  The following\
    \ table shows how\n   each port in a test MUST transmit test frames to all other\
    \ ports in\n   the test.  In this example, there are six ports with 1 address\
    \ per\n   port:\n   Source Port       Destination Ports (in order of transmission)\n\
    \   Port #1           2       3       4       5       6       2...\n   Port #2\
    \           3       4       5       6       1       3...\n   Port #3         \
    \  4       5       6       1       2       4...\n   Port #4           5      \
    \ 6       1       2       3       5...\n   Port #5           6       1       2\

    \      5       1...\n   As shown in the table, there is an equal distribution\
    \ of destination\n   addresses for each transmit opportunity. This keeps the test\
    \ balanced\n   so that one destination port is not overloaded by the test algorithm\n\
    \   and all ports are equally and fully loaded throughout the test.  Not\n   following\
    \ this algorithm exactly will produce inconsistent results.\n   For tests using\
    \ multiple addresses per port, the actual port\n   destinations are the same as\
    \ described above and the actual\n   source/destination address pairs SHOULD be\
    \ chosen randomly to\n   exercise the DUT/SUT's ability to perform address lookups.\n\
    \   For every address, learning frames MUST be sent to the DUT/SUT to\n   allow\
    \ the DUT/SUT update its address tables properly.\n"

    \      misforwarding frames, generating flooded or Spanning-Tree frames\n    \
    \  or is enabling some flow control mechanism.  Ports used for this\n      test\
    \ are either transmitting or receiving, but not both. Those\n      ports which\
    \ are transmitting send test frames destined to\n      addresses corresponding\
    \ to each of the ports receiving.  This\n      creates a unidirectional mesh of\
    \ traffic.\n      All ports on the tester MUST transmit test frames either in\

    \ fashion.  The sequence of\n      addresses MUST NOT change when congestion control\
    \ is applied.\n      The following table shows how each port in a test MUST transmit\n\
    \      test frames to all other ports in the test.  In this 8 port\n      example,\
    \ port 1 through 4 are transmitting and ports 5 through 8\n      are receiving;\

    \ the load\n   is greater than 100% and no frame loss is detected, then the DUT\
    \ must\n   be implementing a flow control mechanism.  The type of flow control\n\
    \   mechanism used is beyond the scope of this memo.\n   It should be noted that\
    \ some DUTs may not be able to handle the 100%\n   load presented at the input\
    \ port. In this case, there may be frame\n   loss reported at the uncongested\
    \ port which is due to the load at the\n   input port rather than the congested\
    \ port's load.\n   If the uncongested frame loss is reported as zero, but the\
    \ maximum\n   forwarding rate is less than 7440 (for 10Mbps Ethernet), then this\n\
    \   may be an indication of congestion control being enforced by the DUT.\n  \
    \ In this case, the congestion control is affecting the throughput of\n   the\
    \ uncongested port.\n   If no congestion control is detected, the expected percentage\
    \ frame\n   loss for the congested port is 33% at 150% overload.  It is receiving\n\
    \   100% load from 1 port, and 50% from another, and can only get 100%\n   possible\

    \ Load per port is expressed in a percentage of the\n      medium's maximum theoretical\
    \ load, regardless of traffic\n      orientation or duplex mode.  Certain test\
    \ configurations will\n      theoretically over-subscribe the DUT/SUT.\n     \

- title: 5.10.3 Procedure
  contents:
  - "5.10.3 Procedure\n   For this test, there are two parts to be run.\n   Broadcast\
    \ Frame Throughput - This portion of the test uses a single\n   source test port\
    \ to transmit test frames with a broadcast address\n   using the frame specified\
    \ in RFC 2544 [3].  Selected receive ports\n   then measure the forwarding rate\
    \ and Frame loss rate.\n   Broadcast Frame Latency - This test uses the same setup\
    \ as the\n   Broadcast Frame throughput, but instead of a large stream of test\n\
    \   frames being sent, only one test frame is sent and the latency to\n   each\
    \ of the receive ports are measured in seconds.\n"
- title: 5.10.4 Measurements
  contents:
  - "5.10.4 Measurements\n   Frame loss rate of the DUT/SUT SHOULD be reported as\
    \ defined in\n   section 26.3 [3] with the following notes: Frame loss rate SHOULD\
    \ be\n   measured at the end of the trial duration.  The term \"rate\", for this\n\
    \   measurement only, does not imply the units in the fashion of \"per\n   second.\"\
    \n   Forwarding rate (FR) of the DUT/SUT SHOULD be reported as the number\n  \
    \ of test frames per second that the device is observed to successfully\n   forward\
    \ to the correct destination interface in response to a\n   specified Oload. \
    \ The Oload MUST also be cited.\n"

- title: B.1 Frame Based Load
  contents:
  - "B.1 Frame Based Load\n   Frame Based Load holds the number of bits constant.\
    \  The Trial\n   Duration will vary based upon congestion control.  Advantage\
    \ is\n   implementation is a simple state machine (or loop).  The disadvantage\n\
    \   is that Oload needs to be measured independently.\n   All ports on the traffic\
    \ generator MUST transmit the exact number of\n   test frames.  The exact number\
    \ of test frames is found by multiplying\n   the Iload of the port by the Trial\
    \ Duration.  All ports MAY NOT\n   transmit the same number of frames if their\
    \ Iload is not the same.\n   An example would be the Partially meshed many-to-one\
    \ test.\n   All ports SHOULD start transmitting their frames within 1% of the\n\
    \   trial duration.  For a trial duration of 30 seconds, all ports SHOULD\n  \
    \ have started transmitting frames within 300 milliseconds of each\n   other.\n\
    \   The reported Oload SHOULD be the average during the Trial Duration.\n   If\
    \ the traffic generator continues to transmit after the Trial\n   Duration due\

- title: B.2 Time Based Load
  contents:
  - "B.2 Time Based Load\n   Time based load holds the Trial Duration constant, while\
    \ allowing the\n   number of octets transmitted to vary.  Advantages are an accurate\n\
    \   Trial Duration and integrated Oload measurement.  Disadvantage is\n   that\
    \ the starting and stopping of the traffic generator MUST be more\n   accurate.\n\
    \   All ports on the traffic generator are configured to transmit the\n   Iload\
    \ for a finite amount of time.  Each port MUST count the number\n   of octets\
    \ successfully transmitted.\n   The start and stop is initiated at a layer defined\
    \ by the test\n   parameters.  The layer can be the MAC layer, IP layer, or some\
    \ other\n   point in the protocol stack.  The traffic generator MUST complete\
    \ its\n   layer specific transmit process when the stop time is reached (i.e.\n\
    \   no fragments, finish the frame).\n   All ports MUST start transmitting their\
    \ frames within 1% of the trial\n   duration.  For a trial duration of 30 seconds,\
    \ all ports SHOULD have\n   started transmitting frames within 300 milliseconds\
    \ of each other.\n   All ports SHOULD stop transmitting frames after the specified\
    \ trail\n   duration within 0.01% of the trial duration.  Each port's stop time\n\
    \   MUST be reference to its start time.  This trial duration error\n   controls\
    \ the accuracy of the Oload measurement and SHOULD be reported\n   with the Oload\
    \ measurement.\n   Each port is allowed an offset error of 0.1% and a trial duration\n\
    \   error of 0.01%.\n   Oload is found by taking the number of octets successfully\n\
    \   transmitted and dividing by the trial duration.  Oload for the\n   DUT/SUT\
    \ MUST be the aggregate of all the Oloads per port.  Oload per\n   port MAY be\
    \ reported for diagnostic purposes.\n"
