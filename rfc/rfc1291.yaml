    \ to its peer networks. The term \"mid-level\" is used as a generic\n   term to\

    \ and transitions, can no longer be termed\n   \"regional\" [MAN]. It discusses\
    \ the pros and cons of offering these\n   services, as well as areas in which\
    \ mid-level networks can work\n   together.\n   A large portion of the ideas stem\
    \ from discussions at the IETF\n   Operational Statistics (OPstat), User Connectivity\
    \ Problems (UCP) and\n   Network Joint Management (NJM) working groups.\n"

  - "1. Introduction\n   Over the past few years, the Internet has grown to be a very\
    \ large\n   entity and its dependability is critical to its users. Furthermore,\n\
    \   due to the size and nature of the network, the trend has been to\n   decentralize\
    \ as many network functions (such as domain name-service,\n   whois, etc.) as\
    \ possible. Efforts are being made in resource\n   discovery [SHHH90] so that\
    \ the work of researchers is not lost in the\n   volumes of data that is available\
    \ on the Internet.\n   A side result of this growth has been the logical structure\
    \ imposed\n   in the Internet of networks classified by function. Tangible examples\n\
    \   in the present state are the NSFnet national backbone, the mid-\n   level/regional\
    \ networks and campus networks. Each of these can be\n   viewed as hierarchies\
    \ within an organization, each serving a slightly\n   different function than\
    \ the other (campus LANs providing access to\n   local resources, mid-level networks\
    \ providing access to remote\n   resources, etc.). The functions of each hierarchy\
    \ then become the\n   \"services\" offered to the organizational layer below it,\
    \ who in turn\n   depend on these services.\n   This document proposes a set of\
    \ basic technical services that could\n   be offered by a mid-level network. These\
    \ services would not only\n   increase the robustness of the mid-level network\
    \ itself, but would\n   also serve to structure the distribution of resources\
    \ and services\n   within the Internet. It also proposes a uniform naming convention\
    \ for\n   locating the hosts offering these services.\n"
- title: 2. The Generic Model
  contents:
  - "2. The Generic Model\n   The Internet model that is used as the basis for this\
    \ document is a\n   graph of mid-level networks connected to one another, each\
    \ in turn\n   connecting the campus/organization networks and with the end users\n\
    \   attached to the campus networks. The model assumes that the mid-level\n  \
    \ networks constitute the highest level of functional division within\n   the\
    \ Internet hierarchy described above (this could change in the\n   unforeseen\
    \ future). With this model in perspective, this document\n   addresses the objectives\
    \ of minimizing unnecessary traffic within the\n   Internet as well as making\
    \ the entire structure as robust as\n   possible.\n   The proposed structure is\
    \ a derived extension of organizational LANs\n   where certain services are offered\
    \ within the organizational LAN\n   itself, such as nameservice, mail, shared\
    \ files, single or\n   hierarchical points of contact for problems, etc.\n   The\
    \ following are the services that are discussed as possible\n   functions of a\
    \ mid-level network:\n     o  Technical services\n     o  Experimental sites for\
    \ testing and dissemination of new\n        software and technology to end sites\
    \ on the network\n   In addition, the following services are mentioned briefly\
    \ which are\n   discussed in detail elsewhere [SSM91, ML91]:\n     o  Network\
    \ Operation services and the interaction between\n        different mid-level\
    \ networks in this area\n     o  Network Information services\n"
- title: 3. Technical Services
  contents:
  - "3. Technical Services\n   The Internet has grown to be an essential entity because\
    \ of the\n   services that it offers to its end users. The list of services is\n\
    \   long and growing, but some services are more widely used and deployed\n  \
    \ than others. This section attempts to list and discuss those\n   technical services\
    \ that could help a mid-level network provide robust\n   and improved services\
    \ to its end sites.\n"
- title: 3.1 Domain Name Service
  contents:
  - "3.1 Domain Name Service\n   According to the NSFnet traffic statistics collected\
    \ for May 1991,\n   about 7% of the packets on the NSFnet backbone were domain\
    \ nameserver\n   (DNS) packets. This is a significant amount of traffic, and since\n\
    \   most of the other network applications depend on this service, a\n   robust\
    \ DNS service is critical to any Internet site.\n   Proper location of secondary\
    \ nameservers so that they are located on\n   different physical networks can\
    \ increase the reliability of this\n   service to a large extent [MOC87a, MOC87b].\
    \ However, the nature of\n   the service requires that the nameservers for the\
    \ next highest level\n   be available in order to resolve names outline-mode side\
    \ of one's\n   domain.  Thus, for \"foo.princeton.edu\" to resolve \"a.mid.net\"\
    , the\n   root nameservers which point to mid.net's nameservers have to be\n \
    \  reachable.\n   To make the service more reliable, the mid-level network could\
    \ have\n   at least one nameserver that is able to resolve nameserver queries\n\
    \   for all domains directly connected to it. Thus, in the event that the\n  \
    \ entire mid-level network becomes isolated from the rest of the\n   Internet,\
    \ applications can still resolve queries for sites directly\n   connected to the\
    \ mid-level network. Without this functionality, there\n   is no way of resolving\
    \ a name if the root (or higher level)\n   nameservers become unreachable, even\
    \ if the query is for a site that\n   is directly connected and reachable.\n \
    \  Strategies for implementing this architecture are discussed in\n   appendix\
    \ B.\n   To locate such a \"meta-domain\" server within a mid-level network, it\n\
    \   is proposed that a nameserver entry for \"meta-dns\" exist within the\n  \
    \ mid-level network's domain.\n"
- title: 3.2 Public Domain Software
  contents:
  - "3.2 Public Domain Software\n   File transfer traffic constituted 23% of the NSFnet\
    \ backbone traffic\n   for May 1991. Public shareware is a very valuable resource\
    \ within the\n   Internet and a considerable amount of effort is being put into\n\
    \   developing applications to track all available resources in the\n   public\
    \ archives [SHHH90].\n   It would be difficult, if not impossible to create an\
    \ up-to-date\n   repository for every public domain package available on the Internet,\n\
    \   simply because of the volume of software and the rate at which new\n   software\
    \ is being developed every day. Some hosts have gained\n   popularity as good\
    \ public archives (such as uunet.uu.net, sumex-\n   aim.stanford.edu, wuarchive.wustl.edu)\
    \ and new developers tend to\n   distribute the software to these sites as distribution\
    \ points. The\n   economics of maintaining centralized archives is another deterrent\
    \ to\n   centralization (the UUnet archives at uunet.uu.net take up roughly\n\
    \   1GB of disk storage).\n   Recently however, a number of methods for resource\
    \ discovery have\n   been developed and are available on the Internet (\"ftp-list\"\
    \ file\n   compiled by John Granose - odin@pilot.njin.net, Archie at\n   archie.cs.mcgill.ca\
    \ and Prospero [NEU]).\n   It is desirable that the mid-level networks be able\
    \ to provide up-\n   to-date pointers to the distribution hosts for available\
    \ public\n   software archives. Coordinating the distribution of a static list\
    \ is\n   difficult (though not impossible) and the use of automated resource\n\
    \   discovery mechanisms such as Archie and Prospero is recommended.\n   Under\
    \ ideal conditions, any software that is popular and significant\n   (e.g., X11,\
    \ TeX, RFC's) could be archived and distributed within the\n   mid-level network,\
    \ but measuring \"popularity\" and \"significance\" are\n   debatable and left\
    \ for further evaluation. Furthermore, a nameserver\n   entry for host \"swdist\"\
    \ within the domain can provide information on\n   the various available alternatives\
    \ for software distribution and\n   discovery (static file location, pointers\
    \ to Archie servers, etc.) --\n   this nameserver entry can be an alias for a\
    \ CNAME or a TXT entry.\n"
- title: 3.3 Network Time
  contents:
  - "3.3 Network Time\n   An important feature of any computer network providing distributed\n\
    \   services is the capability to synchronize the local clocks on the\n   various\
    \ systems in the network. Ideally, the clocks of all the\n   reference sources\
    \ would be synchronized to national standards by wire\n   or radio. The importance\
    \ and immense popularity of this service makes\n   Network Time a very useful\
    \ potential service that can be provided by\n   a mid-level network. No specific\
    \ protocol for maintaining time is\n   proposed, and any available protocol that\
    \ maintains time with\n   reasonable accuracy could be used.\n   Network Time\
    \ Protocol (NTP) traffic constituted 1% of the NSFnet\n   traffic during May 1991.\
    \ The traffic might seem insignificant, but\n   there have been instances where\
    \ a particular stratum-1 timeserver\n   (e.g., one of the stratum-1 servers at\
    \ University of Delaware) has\n   reached a point of overload with too many different\
    \ sites trying to\n   peer with it.\n   It is proposed that at least one stratum-1\
    \ and two stratum-2 servers\n   be located within a mid-level network (the selection\
    \ of three servers\n   is based on the NTP standards documentation [MIL89]). \
    \ Note that the\n   servers can be located at any of the directly connected sites\
    \ in the\n   network as long as they are publicly accessible. All sites connected\n\
    \   to the mid-level network can then coordinate their system times with\n   the\
    \ servers within the mid-level network itself. Besides increasing\n   the reliability\
    \ of the timekeeping network, this approach would also\n   limit the load on each\
    \ timeserver.\n   For locating the network time servers within a domain, nameserver\n\
    \   entries for \"timekeeper-x\" (where x= 1,2,3..) can be made within the\n \
    \  domain. The servers are numbered in order of preference and accuracy.\n   Thus,\
    \ \"timekeeper-1.foo.net\" would be the primary timekeeper and\n   \"timekeeper-2.foo.net\"\
    \ would be additional (possibly secondary)\n   timekeepers within domain \"foo.net\"\
    . If such hosts are not available\n   within a domain, a TXT entry pointing to\
    \ other recommended time-\n   servers could be provided instead.\n"
- title: 3.4 Network News
  contents:
  - "3.4 Network News\n   Network News (or Usenet News) constituted 14% of the NSFnet\
    \ traffic\n   in May 1991. Netnews is an expensive service, both in terms of disk\n\
    \   and CPU power, as well as network bandwidth consumed.\n   The present structure\
    \ of Network News consists of several hub sites\n   which are distributed over\
    \ the Internet. End sites get news feeds\n   from other sites, and an article\
    \ gets injected into the news stream\n   by sending it to the nearest \"upstream\"\
    \ site, which then forwards it\n   to its connected news sites, and so on. There\
    \ is no preset norm for\n   finding a site willing to provide a news feed, and\
    \ it usually ends up\n   being a site with whom the site administrator happens\
    \ to be\n   acquainted. However, this could easily result in some sites not being\n\
    \   able to get an economical news feed from within the mid-level network\n  \
    \ and actually having to derive the feed from a site located on another\n   mid-level\
    \ network.\n   A mid-level network could alleviate such occurrences by being able\
    \ to\n   provide a newsfeed to any or all of its directly connected end sites.\n\
    \   Though an expensive resource, some of the costs can be moderated by\n   acting\
    \ as a transit news feeder so that the news needn't be stored\n   for a long time\
    \ on disk. The software for providing the news feed is\n   not specific and depends\
    \ entirely on the newsfeed provider.\n"
- title: 3.5 Mailing Lists
  contents:
  - "3.5 Mailing Lists\n   Internet mailing lists are another popular source of information\
    \ in\n   parallel to Network News. However, like public software, there is no\n\
    \   central repository of all the possible mailing lists available on the\n  \
    \ Internet, and it would require considerable effort to compile one (at\n   the\
    \ time of writing this document, a fairly comprehensive list is\n   available\
    \ on the Internet and mentioned in appendix A.\n   At this time, there is no clear\
    \ strategy for distributing or\n   maintaining mailing lists. However, it can\
    \ be very expensive for a\n   site to distribute mail to all individual end users\
    \ directly, and if\n   a clear strategy for maintaining a list of mailing-lists\
    \ can be\n   devised, then mail exploders can be set up at the mid-level networks,\n\
    \   each of which forwards the mail to exploders at the end sites. This\n   mechanism\
    \ would reduce the load on the originating systems, and\n   provides a clean path\
    \ for tracking down mailer problems. Also, in\n   order to prevent bounced mail\
    \ from propagating back to the originator\n   of the message, the mailing lists\
    \ should be set up in a way so that\n   bounced mail goes to the the \"owner\"\
    \ of the list and not to the\n   originator of the mail message.\n   A list of\
    \ major mailing lists for the services discussed in this\n   document are listed\
    \ in appendix A.\n"
- title: 4. Experimental Testbeds
  contents:
  - "4. Experimental Testbeds\n   Due to the working relationships that they have\
    \ with their end sites\n   and peer networks, the mid-level networks are very\
    \ good media for\n   distribution of new ideas and technology. Examples of this\
    \ function\n   are the White Pages pilot project [RS90] established by NYSERnet,\
    \ the\n   NSAP routing schema for OSI transitioning [CGC91], etc.\n   The mid-level\
    \ networks could establish cooperative experimental\n   testbeds for testing and\
    \ deployment of new technologies similar to\n   the ones mentioned above. Besides\
    \ deployment and testing of new\n   technology, this could also serve to provide\
    \ a \"help\" service to the\n   end-sites and to get them started with the new\
    \ software.\n   The exact interaction between the mid-level networks in this area\
    \ is\n   not very clear. It is complicated by competition for members between\n\
    \   the mid-level networks and needs to be discussed further.\n"

  - "5. Network Information Services\n   There are a variety of new and useful user\
    \ services available on the\n   Internet that are difficult to document and provide\
    \ a comprehensive\n   list of. Some attempt has been made at documenting such\
    \ resources\n   [NNS] and a mid-level network can be the initial point of contact\
    \ for\n   distribution of such information on a wide basis. The information can\n\
    \   be disseminated in a more controlled and complete manner using this\n   hierarchical\
    \ approach if each mid-level network maintains up-to-date\n   information about\
    \ its directly connected sites. Network Information\n   services (NIC) also make\
    \ the network easier and more attractive to\n   end users. Examples of these services\
    \ are:\n     o  provide information resources\n          -  security advisory\
    \ messages\n          -  list of library catalogs [GL91]\n          -  geographical\

- title: 6. Network Operations
  contents:
  - "6. Network Operations\n   The Network Operation Center's (NOC's) at the mid-level\
    \ networks need\n   to cooperate with each other to resolve network problems.\
    \  In the\n   event of a network problem between two mid-level networks or if\
    \ an\n   end-site has trouble getting to any host, the mid-level network NOCs\n\
    \   can serve to be the initial point of contact. The procedures for\n   interaction\
    \ among NOCs and the formats for exchange of trouble-\n   tickets between the\
    \ NOCs are described elsewhere [JOH91, ML91].\n   It is important for cooperating\
    \ NOCs to have contact information for\n   their directly connected campus/organizational\
    \ sites and also about\n   their peer mid-level networks. A distributed mechanism\
    \ for\n   maintaining contact information could be implemented by using a\n  \
    \ nameserver TXT entry for \"noc\" or by maintaining \"finger\" information\n\
    \   for user \"noc@domain\" or \"noc@noc.domain\". A NOC \"phonebook\" listing\n\
    \   the contact information for the various NOCs can be used as a static\n   non-distributed\
    \ mechanism (it is understood that the phonebook can\n   contain outdated information,\
    \ but the distributed mechanisms can\n   provide correct and updated NOC information\
    \ provided that the hosts\n   are reachable at the desired time).  If it is undesirable\
    \ to publish\n   the phone number or email address of the NOC for any reason,\
    \ an entry\n   saying \"unpublished\" (or words to that effect) could exist in\
    \ the\n   nameserver or \"finger\" entry instead.\n"

  contents:
  - "Appendix B - DNS Architecture Strategy\n   This section discusses practical strategies\
    \ for implementing a\n   nameserver architecture within a mid-level network, so\
    \ that it can\n   resolve nameserver queries for all domains directly attached\
    \ to it.\n   In order to resolve queries for all directly connected networks,\
    \ a\n   host that is authoritative for all directly attached domains will\n  \
    \ need to exist within the mid-level network. Nameservers at the end\n   sites\
    \ would then treat this \"group-of-domains\" nameserver as a\n   forwarding server\
    \ to resolve all non-local queries.\n   This can be done by adding a line to the\
    \ named.boot file on the end\n   site nameservers such as:\n              forwarders\
    \ 128.121.50.7 128.32.0.4\n   This method has the added advantage that the forwarding\
    \ server builds\n   up a very rich cache of data [BOG] and acts like a metacache\
