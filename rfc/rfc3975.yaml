- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   This document contains a set of principles and guidelines\
    \ that serves\n   as the basis for establishing a cooperation framework between\
    \ the\n   Open Mobile Alliance (OMA) and the Internet Engineering Task Force\n\
    \   (IETF).  This cooperation is intended to secure timely development of\n  \
    \ technical specifications that facilitate maximum interoperability\n   with existing\
    \ (fixed and mobile) Internet systems, devices, and\n   protocols.\n   Within\
    \ the OMA, specific activities are undertaken through OMA\n   working groups,\
    \ each with an area of responsibility.  These\n   activities are authorized, and\
    \ their output is approved by, the OMA\n   Technical Plenary.  The list of OMA\
    \ working groups, OMA\n   Specifications for public comment, the OMA work program,\
    \ and publicly\n   available working group drafts can be found at the OMA web\
    \ site,\n   <http://www.openmobilealliance.org>.\n   Within the IETF, activities\
    \ are undertaken within a framework of\n   Areas, with specific activities being\
    \ undertaken by working groups\n   that are chartered within each Area.  Working\
    \ group output is\n   reviewed by the Internet Engineering Steering Group (IESG)\
    \ and\n   published by the RFC-Editor.  IETF activities are based on a\n   principle\
    \ of open contribution and participation by any interested\n   party.  Information\
    \ on IETF working groups, current work item drafts,\n   meeting schedules, and\
    \ mailing lists are published on the IETF web\n   site, <http://www.ietf.org>.\n\
    \   The IETF and the OMA, are cooperating with a mutual desire to support\n  \
    \ the integrity of specifications and standards developed by each body.\n   The\
    \ preferred approach is that the OMA uses the Internet standards\n   unchanged,\
    \ if feasible, and communicates requirements for change to\n   the IETF, as needed.\
    \  The parties intend to work together in an\n   effort to avoid duplication of\
    \ work.\n   Each organization will operate according to its own rules and\n  \
    \ procedures, including rules governing Intellectual Property Rights\n   (IPR),\
    \ specification elaboration, approval, and maintenance.\n   This cooperation framework\
    \ is intended to guide collaborative\n   efforts, and should be put into use in\
    \ as much as it is applicable to\n   these efforts.  If either party finds this\
    \ framework inapplicable,\n   then it may notify the other party so that this\
    \ framework may be\n   modified or withdrawn, as appropriate.\n"
- title: 2.  Basis of Collaboration
  contents:
  - "2.  Basis of Collaboration\n   In the further development of OMA specifications,\
    \ the benefit of\n   adopting Internet specifications has been identified.\n \
    \  Although this document recognizes the importance of interoperability\n   of\
    \ OMA specifications with the existing Internet and hence the use of\n   IETF\
    \ standards, the OMA recognizes that additions or modifications\n   might be needed\
    \ in order to make the IETF Internet specifications\n   meet the needs of the\
    \ OMA.  In such cases, the OMA will take its\n   concerns directly to the appropriate\
    \ IETF working groups for\n   resolution.  When no appropriate working group can\
    \ be found or it is\n   not known where to direct the communication, or in the\
    \ case of\n   resolution of consequent matters, the issue will be raised through\n\
    \   the OMA's designated liaison to the IETF.\n   The IETF may also need to ask\
    \ questions of the OMA in order to refine\n   its understanding of OMA requirements\
    \ or may wish to offer guidance\n   to OMA on the effective use of Internet specifications.\
    \  Where\n   possible, these communications will occur in the context of a\n \
    \  discussion between OMA and an IETF working group.  In the event that\n   a\
    \ working group level discussion is deemed inappropriate for the\n   desired communication,\
    \ the matter will be raised through the IETF's\n   designated liaison to the OMA.\n"
- title: 3.  Document Sharing
  contents:
  - "3.  Document Sharing\n   Both the OMA and the IETF encourage the sharing of draft\
    \ documents\n   that are of mutual interest.\n   All IETF documents are publicly\
    \ available from the IETF web site, and\n   discussion of documents is hosted\
    \ on open mailing lists.\n   OMA documents intended for public consumption, including\
    \ working\n   drafts, are published for open access on the OMA web site,\n   <http://www.openmobilealliance.org/>.\
    \  Technical contributions to OMA\n   by its members are also encouraged to make\
    \ publicly available.\n   The OMA and the IETF will work to update and exchange,\
    \ on a regular\n   basis, a list of dependencies between each organization's\n\
    \   specifications and work in progress.\n"
- title: 4.  Participation in the IETF Process
  contents:
  - "4.  Participation in the IETF Process\n   Participation in the IETF process is\
    \ completely open.  This allows\n   OMA delegates to participate to whatever extent\
    \ the OMA considers\n   appropriate in IETF meetings and mailing list discussions\
    \ to assist\n   the IETF in refining its understanding of OMA requirements and\
    \ in\n   meeting requirements that the IETF deems appropriate.  This close\n \
    \  working relationship also offers an excellent opportunity for OMA\n   delegates\
    \ to receive informal guidance from IETF on OMA's use of\n   Internet specifications.\n\
    \   The vast majority of technical discussions and decision making within\n  \
    \ the IETF is undertaken by using open mailing lists.  It is\n   recommended that\
    \ interested individuals subscribe to and participate\n   on these lists.\n  \
    \ The OMA is to be notified of new work to be undertaken by the IETF\n   via a\
    \ nominated IETF liaison notification mechanism.\n"
- title: 5.  Designated Liaisons
  contents:
  - "5.  Designated Liaisons\n   When the informal working group level of interaction\
    \ is insufficient,\n   matters can be raised through a liaison channel.  The OMA\
    \ and the\n   IETF shall each establish liaison functions for communication with\n\
    \   the other organization and shall appoint one or more individuals to\n   those\
    \ functions.\n"
- title: 5.1.  IETF Liaison to OMA
  contents:
  - "5.1.  IETF Liaison to OMA\n   The preferred way for organizations to work with\
    \ IETF is through the\n   working groups.  However, IETF has a limited number\
    \ of individual\n   liaison roles with other organizations when conditions warrant\
    \ the\n   appointment of a specific person.\n   The Internet Architecture Board\
    \ (IAB) shall appoint a specific person\n   to serve as the OMA Liaison.  The\
    \ role of the IETF's OMA Liaison is\n   to act as an initial contact point in\
    \ IETF for administrative aspects\n   of this collaboration that cannot easily\
    \ be handled in other ways\n   (e.g., at a technical level by interactions with\
    \ IETF Working Groups\n   or Area Directors).  It is agreed that the role does\
    \ not carry the\n   expectation of attendance at OMA meetings or participation\
    \ in OMA\n   administrative processes, and it is anticipated that all liaison\n\
    \   efforts assigned to this individual will be carried out by electronic\n  \
    \ mail.  It is understood that the liaison does not have the ability to\n   make\
    \ exceptions to, or special provisions for, IETF policies and\n   procedures.\n\
    \   It is expected that the individual appointed to this role would:\n   o  be\
    \ informed by the OMA of OMA activities on behalf of the IETF,\n      including\
    \ new work proposals, and be able to report those using\n      appropriate channels\
    \ within the IETF,\n   o  convey liaisons statements from the OMA to the IETF,\
    \ and be\n      responsible for shepherding the OMA communication to the relevant\n\
    \      parts of the IETF,\n   o  report to the OMA on progress with IETF consideration\
    \ of OMA\n      liaison statements, and\n   o  have direct access to the OMA technical\
    \ leadership as well as\n      direct access to the IAB and IETF Area Directors,\
    \ as required.\n   OMA meetings are normally only open to delegates from OMA member\n\
    \   organizations.  To assist the information flow between the\n   organizations,\
    \ the IETF may, by prior written invitation from the OMA\n   on a per-case basis,\
    \ send a representative to participate in and\n   represent the IETF at an OMA\
    \ Technical Plenary and working group\n   meeting under conditions set forth by\
    \ the OMA.  The representative\n   could be the IETF liaison or, in the event\
    \ that the liaison cannot\n   attend, some other designated individual.\n"
- title: 5.2.  OMA Liaison to IETF
  contents:
  - "5.2.  OMA Liaison to IETF\n   The OMA Technical Plenary shall establish an IETF\
    \ liaison to be the\n   initial contact point in the OMA for matters pertaining\
    \ to the OMA-\n   IETF cooperation.  The OMA-IETF liaison function, therefore,\
    \ is\n   expected to work with the concerned IETF and OMA working groups and\n\
    \   to support the interaction between the OMA and the IETF.\n"
- title: 6.  Formal Liaison Statements
  contents:
  - "6.  Formal Liaison Statements\n   Whenever possible, and as the preferred primary\
    \ method of\n   communication and coordination of activity, communication at the\n\
    \   working group level is strongly encouraged.\n   When deemed necessary, formal\
    \ communication between OMA and IETF is\n   also permitted.  These communications\
    \ are to be recorded in the form\n   of Liaison Statements, and the IETF will\
    \ use the OMA liaison role to\n   convey these statements between the IETF and\
    \ the OMA.  All liaison\n   statements made by the IETF or directed to the IETF\
    \ shall be\n   published by the IETF as public documents.  All liaison statements\n\
    \   made by the IETF will comply with the IETF IPR policy as documented\n   in\
    \ RFC 3667 [1] and RFC 3668 [2].\n"
- title: 7.  Contributions
  contents:
  - "7.  Contributions\n   OMA members may make contributions to the IETF in their\
    \ capacity as\n   IETF participants, under the IETF's IPR policy, as documented\
    \ in RFC\n   3667 [1] and RFC3668 [2].\n   IETF participants who are also members\
    \ of the OMA may make\n   contributions to the OMA only in their capacity as OMA\
    \ members, under\n   the OMA's membership rules, including its IPR policy.\n \
    \  OMA mailing lists are not open to the general public.  It is\n   recommended\
    \ that work of mutual interest be discussed on the relevant\n   IETF mailing lists.\n\
    \   The OMA may make normative references to the IETF Proposed Standard,\n   Draft\
    \ Standard, Standard, Best Common Practice and Informational\n   specifications\
    \ that are published as part of the \"Request for\n   Comments\" (RFC) document\
    \ series.\n"
