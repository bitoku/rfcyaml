Two recently installed features of the Multics  Network  software might be of general interest to the Network community, and should be of particular interest to those who use Multics via TIP's:
In  order  to allow Network users at upper case only terminals on systems
which do not  furnish  case mapping  to  access  Multics, typing
message  actuates Multics software which applies the following typing conventions: 1) as most Multics  input  is  lower case,  alphabetic  input  is mapped  to  lower case,  except  for  any  letter immediately preceded by " 2) back (left)
arrow  is  treated  as  underscore,  up  arrow  as circumflex, apostrophe as acute (right) accent 3)
escape sequences exist for the following:
The case mapping software is also actuated if "HELP" (upper case) is  typed  prior  to  login  in  response  to the system's "login incorrect" message, in which case the normal  information  (which would  appear  in response to lower case "help" as well) on login format will be printed out.
the same  as  existing Multics   conventions for direct dialled Model 33/35
On these particular devices, " indicated on the key caps: it is input as SHIFT L.)
Output  to  systems  which give small allocations has long been a problem, both to the remote user (who experienced frequent pauses in the output at  his  terminal)  and  to
the  Multics  "Network Daemon"  process  (which  encountered  considerable  inefficiency because of being frequently awakened to process the  ALL  control messages).
To alleviate this, we have introduced interrupt time code which processes the ALL's and  outputs
the  next  group  of bytes  without  causing
the Network Daemon to take a wakeup.
As attendees of the ICCC will have already observed, response is far superior under the new scheme.
(System  Programmers  responsible for  NCP's
that some 75% of our control message processing deals with ALL's.)
