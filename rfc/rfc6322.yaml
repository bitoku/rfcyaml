- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   As described in Section 5 of [RFC4844], there are currently\
    \ four\n   streams that feed into the RFC publication process: the IETF document\n\
    \   stream, the Internet Architecture Board (IAB) document stream, the\n   Internet\
    \ Research Task Force (IRTF) document stream, and the\n   Independent Submissions\
    \ stream that is administered by the\n   Independent Submissions Editor (ISE).\
    \  Each of these streams consist\n   of Internet-Drafts (often abbreviated \"\
    I-Ds\") that have been\n   identified by an organization or role as being part\
    \ of their stream.\n   Each stream maintainer progresses documents towards RFC\
    \ publication\n   in its own fashion.  A document can only be in one stream at\
    \ a time.\n   In recent years, there has been a desire by IETF participants and\n\
    \   others to see more of the process used by each stream.  For example,\n   some\
    \ people want to know how close the IAB is to finishing a\n   particular document;\
    \ IETF participants might want to know the\n   progress of IRTF research documents\
    \ that are in areas related to\n   their engineering work; people who have asked\
    \ for the ISE to publish\n   their document want to track its progress.  If the\
    \ IETF Datatracker\n   (\"tracker\") has more information about each stream's\
    \ states, this\n   information is much more easily accessible.\n   In this document,\
    \ the term \"IETF Datatracker\" is used as a generic\n   name for the existing\
    \ tool used to track state changes as Internet-\n   Drafts are processed.  The\
    \ word \"IETF\" in the name \"IETF Datatracker\"\n   is not meant to limit use\
    \ of the tool to the IETF document stream;\n   this document expands use of the\
    \ tool to the other streams described\n   in RFC 4844.\n   This document describes\
    \ the additional tracker states that are\n   specific to each of the IAB, the\
    \ IRTF, and the ISE document flows.  A\n   document might also have one or more\
    \ annotations assigned as well.\n   Because each stream is controlled by a different\
    \ organization, this\n   document separates out the proposed states and annotations\
    \ for each\n   stream, and associates specific semantics stream-by-stream.\n \
    \  Annotations may be applied at any time to a document that is intended\n   for\
    \ the particular stream.  A document may have more than one\n   annotation applied\
    \ to it.  It is likely that the comments for these\n   annotations will supply\
    \ valuable information about the annotation.\n   Each stream owner needs to have\
    \ write access to the states and\n   annotations for all the documents in their\
    \ stream.  They should also\n   be able to assign others to have the same write\
    \ privileges.\n   This document does not describe which person in each stream\
    \ might be\n   able to edit these states and annotations; it is assumed that this\
    \ is\n   a simple enough task that it can be negotiated between each stream\n\
    \   administrator and the tracker administrator.  Also, this document\n   assumes\
    \ that whoever is making the edits to the state and annotations\n   can enter\
    \ comments that will be publicly visible.\n   Some streams have comments that\
    \ are very long, such as document\n   reviews and document poll results.  The\
    \ tracker needs to be able to\n   store long annotation comments.\n   Note that\
    \ this document does not discuss documents in the IETF\n   stream.  The states\
    \ and permissions for IETF stream documents that\n   have been requested for publication\
    \ are already implemented in the\n   tracker.  A separate set of documents, [RFC6174]\
    \ and [RFC6175],\n   describe the tracker states and associated permissions proposed\
    \ for\n   documents in the IETF stream that have been adopted, or are being\n\
    \   considered for adoption, by IETF Working Groups.\n   The intent of this document\
    \ is to inform an initial development\n   effort for the tool described here.\
    \  It is not intended to stand as\n   the requirements against the tool once it\
    \ is deployed.  That is,\n   there is no current intention to update this document\
    \ frequently as\n   the tool evolves and small features are added and changed.\n\
    \   This document defines three state machines that fit into the IETF\n   Datatracker.\
    \  The Datatracker will have multiple state machines.\n   This document was prepared\
    \ in coordination with the IAB, IRTF, and\n   ISE, at the request of the IETF\
    \ Administrative Oversight Committee\n   (IAOC).\n"

- title: 6.  Movement between Streams
  contents:
  - "6.  Movement between Streams\n   Internet-Drafts sometimes move between streams.\
    \  For example, a draft\n   might start out in the IETF stream but then move to\
    \ the Independent\n   Submission stream, or a draft might move from an IRTF RG\
    \ to the IETF\n   stream.  Thus, the IETF Datatracker needs to be able to change\
    \ the\n   designated stream of a draft.  It is expected that this will be done\n\
    \   by the stream managers.  In addition, the IETF Datatracker should\n   preserve\
    \ all data from the earlier stream(s) when a document moves\n   between streams.\n\
    \   Internet-Drafts sometimes move out of a stream into a non-stream\n   state.\
    \  For example, a draft that is in the \"Candidate IAB Document\",\n   \"Candidate\
    \ RG Document\", or \"Submission Received\" state might not be\n   adopted by\
    \ the stream and revert back to having no stream-specific\n   state.  The IETF\
    \ Datatracker needs to be able to handle the\n   transition from having a stream-related\
    \ state to a null state.\n   New streams may be added in the future, and the tool\
    \ needs to be able\n   to handle additional streams.\n"
