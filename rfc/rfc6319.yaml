  - "1.  Introduction\n   [RFC1918] sets aside three blocks of IPv4 address space\
    \ for use in\n   private networks: 192.168.0.0/16, 172.16.0.0/12 and 10.0.0.0/8.\n\
    \   These blocks can be used simultaneously in multiple, separately\n   managed\
    \ networks without registration or coordination with IANA or\n   any Internet\
    \ registry.  Very large networks can find that they need\n   to number more device\
    \ interfaces than there are available addresses\n   in these three ranges.  It\
    \ has occasionally been suggested that\n   additional private IPv4 address space\
    \ should be reserved for use by\n   these networks.  Although such an action might\
    \ address some of the\n   needs for these very large network operators, it is\
    \ not without\n   consequences, particularly as we near the date when the IANA\
    \ free\n   pool will be fully allocated.\n   The overall conclusion is that allocating\
    \ additional address space to\n   be used as private address space has severe\
    \ problems and would, for\n   instance, impact any software or configuration that\
    \ has built-in\n   assumptions about private address space.  However, it is also\
    \ well\n   understood that cascading Network Address Translation (NAT)\n   deployments\
    \ in the existing private address space will cause\n   different types of severe\
    \ problems when address spaces overlap.  At\n   this point, there is no clear\
    \ agreement of the likelihood of various\n   problems or the respective trade-offs.\n"

  - "2.  Large Networks\n   The main categories of very large networks using private\
    \ address\n   space are: cable operators, wireless (cell phone) operators, private\n\
    \   internets, and VPN service providers.  In the case of the first two\n   categories,\
    \ the complete address space reserved in [RFC1918] tends to\n   be used by a single\
    \ organization.  In the case of private internets\n   and VPN service providers,\
    \ there are multiple independently managed\n   and operated networks and the difficulty\
    \ is in avoiding address\n   clashes.\n"

  contents:
  - "3.1.  Subscriber Use Network Address Translation\n   The address space set aside\
    \ in [RFC1918] is a finite resource that\n   can be used to provide limited Internet\
    \ access via NAT.  A discussion\n   of the advantages and disadvantages of NATs\
    \ is outside the scope of\n   this document, but an analysis of the advantages,\
    \ disadvantages, and\n   architectural implications can be found in [RFC2993].\
    \  Nonetheless,\n   it must be acknowledged that NAT is adequate in some situations\
    \ and\n   not in others.  For instance, it might technically be feasible to use\n\
    \   NAT or even multiple layers of NAT within the networks operated by\n   residential\
    \ users or corporations where only limited Internet access\n   is required.  A\
    \ more detailed analysis can be found in [RFC3022].\n   Where true peer-to-peer\
    \ communication is needed or where services or\n   applications do not work properly\
    \ behind NAT, globally unique address\n   space is required.  In other cases,\
    \ NAT traversal techniques\n   facilitate peer-to-peer like communication for\
    \ devices behind NATs.\n   In many cases, it is possible to use multiple layers\
    \ of NAT to re-use\n   parts of the address space defined in [RFC1918].  It is\
    \ not always\n   possible to rely on Customer Premises Equipment (CPE) devices\
    \ using\n   any particular range, however.  In some cases, this means that\n \
    \  unorthodox workarounds including assigning CPE devices unallocated\n   address\
    \ space or address space allocated to other network operators\n   are feasible.\
    \  In other cases, organizations choose to operate\n   multiple separate routing\
    \ domains to allow them to re-use the same\n   private address ranges in multiple\
    \ contexts.  One consequence of this\n   is the added complexity involved in identifying\
    \ which system is\n   referred to when an IP address is identified in a log or\
    \ management\n   system.\n"

    \ IPv6 is a major endeavor\n   for service providers with millions of consumers\
    \ and is likely to\n   take considerable effort and time.  In some cases, implementing\

    \   Address Space\n   The Regional Internet Registry (RIR) communities have recently\
    \ been\n   developing policies to allow organizations with available address\n\
    \   space to transfer such designated space to other organizations\n   [RIR-POLICY].\
    \  In other cases, leases might be arranged.  This\n   approach is only viable\
    \ for operators of very large networks if\n   enough address space is made available\
    \ for transfer or lease and if\n   the very large networks are able to pay the\
    \ costs of these transfers.\n   It is not possible to know how much address space\

    \ it\n   will cost.  However, it is unlikely to become available in large\n  \

    \ the operator as a significant number of small prefixes\n   would inflate the\
    \ size of the operators routing table at a time when\n   it is also adding an\

    \ proposition to many large network\n   operators.  Leases might not be attractive\
    \ to some organizations if\n   both parties cannot agree to a suitable length\

    \   Some network operators have considered using IP address space that is\n  \
    \ allocated to another organization but is not publicly visible in BGP\n   routing\
    \ tables.  This option is very strongly discouraged as the fact\n   that an address\
    \ block is not visible from one view does not mean that\n   it is not visible\
    \ from another.  Furthermore, address usage tends to\n   leak beyond private network\
    \ borders in e-mail headers, DNS queries,\n   traceroute output and other ways.\
    \  The ambiguity this causes is\n   problematic for multiple organizations.  This\

- title: 5.1.  Redefining Existing Unicast Space as Private Address Space
  contents:
  - "5.1.  Redefining Existing Unicast Space as Private Address Space\n   It is possible\
    \ to re-designate a portion of the current global\n   unicast IPv4 address space\
    \ as private unicast address space.  Doing\n   this could benefit a number of\
    \ operators of large networks for the\n   short period before they complete their\
    \ IPv6 roll-out.  However, this\n   benefit incurs a cost by reducing the pool\
    \ of global unicast\n   addresses available to users in general.\n   When discussing\
    \ re-designating a portion of the current global\n   unicast IPv4 address space\
    \ as private unicast address space, it is\n   important to consider how much space\
    \ would be used and for how long\n   it would be sufficient.  Not all of the large\
    \ networks making full\n   use of the space defined in [RFC1918] would have their\
    \ needs met with\n   a single /8.  In 2005, [HAIN] suggested reserving three /8s\
    \ for this\n   purpose, while in 2009 [DAVIES] suggested a single /10 would be\n\
    \   sufficient.  There does not seem to be a consensus for a particular\n   prefix\
    \ length nor an agreed basis for deciding what is sufficient.\n   The problem\
    \ is exacerbated by the continually changing needs of ever\n   expanding networks.\n\
    \   A further consideration is which of the currently unallocated IPv4\n   unicast\
    \ /8 blocks should be used for this purpose.  Using address\n   space that is\
    \ known to be used unofficially is tempting.  For\n   instance, 1.0.0.0/8, which\
    \ was unallocated until January 2010, was\n   proposed in [HAIN] and is known\
    \ to be used by a number of different\n   users.  These include networks making\
    \ use of HIP LSIs [RFC4423],\n   [WIANA], [anoNet], and others.  There is anecdotal\
    \ [VEGODA] and\n   research [WESSELS] evidence to suggest that several other IPv4\
    \ /8s\n   are used in this fashion.  Also there have been discussions [NANOG]\n\
    \   about some sections of these /8's being carved out and filtered,\n   therefore\
    \ unofficially enabling the use of these sections for private\n   use.\n   Although\
    \ new IPv4 /8s are allocated approximately once a month, they\n   are not easy\
    \ to bring into use because network operators are slow to\n   change their filter\
    \ configurations.  This is despite long-running\n   awareness campaigns [CYMRU]\
    \ [LEWIS] and active work [ripe-351] to\n   notify people whose filters are not\
    \ changed in a timely fashion.\n   Updating code that recognizes private address\
    \ space in deployed\n   software and infrastructure systems is likely to be far\
    \ more\n   difficult as many systems have these ranges hard-coded and cannot be\n\
    \   quickly changed with a new configuration file.\n   Another consideration when\
    \ redefining existing unicast space as\n   private address space is that no single\
    \ class of user can expect the\n   space to stay unique to them.  This means that\
    \ an ISP using a new\n   private address range cannot expect its customers not\
    \ to already be\n   using that address range within their own networks.\n"

  - "5.2.  Unique IPv4 Space Shared by a Group of Operators\n   Where a group of networks\
    \ find themselves in a position where they\n   each need a large amount of IPv4\
    \ address space from an RIR in\n   addition to that defined in [RFC1918], they\

    \ networks.  The\n   clear benefit to this approach is that it significantly reduces\
    \ the\n   potential demand on the pool of unallocated IPv4 address space.\n  \
    \ However, the issues discussed in Sections 4.2.2 and 5.3 are of\n   concern here,\
    \ particularly the possibility that one operator might\n   decide to use the address\
