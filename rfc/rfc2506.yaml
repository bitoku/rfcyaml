- title: 2.1 Media feature tag purpose
  contents:
  - "2.1 Media feature tag purpose\n   Media feature tags represent individual and\
    \ simple characteristics\n   related to media capabilities or properties associated\
    \ with the\n   resource to which they are applied.  Examples of such features\
    \ are:\n   * the color depth of the screen on which something is to be displayed\n\
    \   * the type of paper available in a printer\n   * the support of the `floating\
    \ 5 dimensional tables' feature\n   * the fonts which are available to the recipient\n\
    \   * the capability to display graphical content\n   Each media feature tag identifies\
    \ a single characteristic. Values\n   associated with a specific tag must use\
    \ the data type defined for\n   that tag.  The list of allowed data types is presented\
    \ below, in\n   section 2.3.\n   Examples of media feature tags with values are:\n\
    \   * the width of a display in pixels per centimeter represented as an\n   integer\
    \ value.\n   * a font available to a recipient, selected from an enumerated list.\n\
    \   * the version of a protocol composed of integers \"i.j.k\", defined as\n \
    \  either a value in an enumerated list or with a defined mapping to\n   make\
    \ the value isomorphic to a subset of integers (e.g. i*100 + j*10\n   +k, assuming\
    \ j<=9 and k<=9).\n   Further examples of media feature tags are defined in detail\n\
    \   elsewhere [4].\n   Feature collections may be composed using a number of individual\n\
    \   feature tags [2]. Composition of feature collections is described\n   elsewhere\
    \ [2].  Examples of feature collections requiring multiple\n   media feature tags\
    \ are:\n   * the set of all fonts used by a document\n   * the width and height\
    \ of a display\n   * the combination of color depth and resolution a display can\
    \ support\n   This registry presumes the availability of the MIME media type\n\
    \   registry, and MIME media types MUST NOT be re-registered as media\n   feature\
    \ tags.  Media feature tags which are currently in use by\n   individual protocols\
    \ or applications MAY be registered with this\n   registry if they might be applied\
    \ outside of their current domain.\n   The media feature tag namespace is not\
    \ bound to a particular\n   transport protocol or capability exchange mechanism.\
    \  The registry is\n   limited, however, to feature tags which express a capability\
    \ or\n   preference related to how content is presented.  Feature tags related\n\
    \   to other axes of negotiation are not appropriate for this registry.\n   Capability\
    \ exchange mechanisms may, of course, be used to express a\n   variety of capabilities\
    \ or preferences.\n"
- title: 2.2 Media feature tag syntax
  contents:
  - "2.2 Media feature tag syntax\n   A media feature tag is a string consisting of\
    \ one or more of the\n   following US-ASCII characters: uppercase letters, lowercase\
    \ letters,\n   digits, colon (\":\"), slash (\"/\"), dot (\".\") percent (\"%\"\
    ), and dash\n   (\"-\"). Feature tags are case-insensitive.  Dots are understood\
    \ to\n   potentially imply hierarchy; a feature can be subtyped by describing\n\
    \   it as tree.feature.subfeature and by indicating this in the\n   registration.\
    \  Tags should begin with an alphabetic character.\n   In ABNF [6], this may be\
    \ represented as:\n   Feature-tag = ALPHA *( ALPHA / DIGIT / \":\" / \"/\" / \"\
    .\" / \"-\" /\"%\" )\n   Registrants should take care to avoid creating tags which\
    \ might\n   conflict with the creation of new registration trees; in general this\n\
    \   means avoiding tags which begin with an alphabetic character followed\n  \
    \ by a dot.  The current registration trees are described in section 3\n   below.\n"
- title: 2.3 Media feature tag values
  contents:
  - "2.3 Media feature tag values\n   The registry will initially support the use\
    \ of the following data\n   types as tag values:\n      - signed integers\n  \
    \    - rational numbers\n      - tokens, with equality relationship\n      - tokens,\
    \ with defined ordering relationship\n      - strings, with standard (octet-by-octet)\
    \ equality relationship\n      - strings, with defined equality and/or comparison\
    \ relationship\n   \"Token\" here means the token data type as defined by [7],\
    \ which may\n   be summarized as:\n      token          = 1*<any CHAR except CTLs\
    \ or tspecials>\n      tspecials      = \"(\" / \")\" / \"<\" / \">\" / \"@\"\n\
    \                     / \",\" / \";\" / \":\" / \"\\\" / <\">\n              \
    \       / \"/\" / \"[\" / \"]\" / \"?\" / \"=\"\n                     / \"{\"\
    \ / \"}\" / SP / HT\n   At the time of registration, each tag must be associated\
    \ with a\n   single data type.  If that data type implies a defined comparison\
    \ or\n   an ordering, the registrant must define the ordering or comparison.\n\
    \   For ordered tokens, this may be by full enumeration of the tokens and\n  \
    \ their order or by reference to an ordering mechanism.  For defined\n   comparisons,\
    \ a full description of the rules for comparison must be\n   provided or included\
    \ by reference.\n   Media feature tags related to spatial or temporal characteristics\n\
    \   must be registered with a single canonical unit.  It is strongly\n   preferred\
    \ that units be in the SI system; where current practice has\n   defined units\
    \ in other systems (such as pixels per inch), a\n   conversion method to SI units\
    \ must be provided.  Conversion methods\n   should include a defined rounding\
    \ practice.\n"
- title: 2.4  ASN.1 identifiers for media feature tags
  contents:
  - "2.4  ASN.1 identifiers for media feature tags\n   Certain protocols use ASN.1\
    \ identifiers rather than human-readable\n   representations for capability exchange.\
    \  In order to allow both\n   systems to interoperate, registrants may provide\
    \ an ASN.1 identifier\n   or ask that IANA assign an ASN.1 identifier during registration.\n\
    \   These identifiers are not required for registration, but may provide\n   assistance\
    \ to those building gateways or other cross-protocol\n   systems.  Note that ASN.1\
    \ identifiers assigned by IANA will be\n   treated as tokens, not as elements\
    \ from which sub-delegated\n   identifiers may be created or derived.\n"
- title: 3 Media feature tag registration
  contents:
  - "3 Media feature tag registration\n   Media feature tags can be registered in\
    \ several different\n   registration trees, with different requirements as discussed\
    \ below.\n   The vocabulary for these requirements is taken from [5]. In general,\n\
    \   a feature tag registration proposal is circulated and reviewed in a\n   fashion\
    \ appropriate to the tree involved.  The feature tag is then\n   registered if\
    \ the proposal is accepted.\n   Review of a feature tag in the URI tree is not\
    \ required.\n"
- title: 3.1 Registration trees
  contents:
  - "3.1 Registration trees\n   The following subsections define registration \"trees\"\
    , distinguished\n   by the use of faceted names (e.g., names of the form \"tree.feature-\n\
    \   name\").\n"
- title: 3.1.1 IETF tree
  contents:
  - "3.1.1 IETF tree\n   The IETF tree is intended for media feature tags of general\
    \ interest\n   to the Internet Community, and proposals for these tags must meet\
    \ the\n   \"IETF Consensus\" policies described in [5].\n   Registration in the\
    \ IETF tree requires approval by the IESG and\n   publication of the feature tag\
    \ specification as an RFC.  Submissions\n   for feature tag registration in the\
    \ IETF tree can originate in any WG\n   of the IETF or as an individual submission\
    \ to the IESG.\n   Feature tags in the IETF tree normally have names that are\
    \ not\n   explicitly faceted, i.e., do not contain period (\".\", full stop)\n\
    \   characters.\n"
- title: 3.1.2 Global tree
  contents:
  - "3.1.2 Global tree\n   Tags in the global tree will be distinguished by the leading\
    \ facet\n   \"g.\".  An organization may propose either a designation indicative\
    \ of\n   the feature, (e.g., \"g.blinktags\") or a faceted designation including\n\
    \   the organization name (e.g., \"g.organization.blinktags\").\n   Organizations\
    \ which have registered media types under the MIME vendor\n   tree should use\
    \ the same organizational name for media feature tags\n   if they propose a faceted\
    \ designation. The acceptance of the proposed\n   designation is at the discretion\
    \ of the IANA. If the IANA believes\n   that a designation needs clarification\
    \ it may request a new proposal\n   from the proposing organization or otherwise\
    \ coordinate the\n   development of an appropriate designation.\n   Registrations\
    \ of feature tags in the global tree must meet the\n   \"Expert Review\" policies\
    \ described in [5].  In this case, a\n   designated area expert will review the\
    \ proposed tag, consulting with\n   the members of a related mailing list.  A\
    \ registration may be\n   proposed for the global tree by anyone who has the need\
    \ to allow for\n   communication on a particular capability or preference.\n"
- title: 3.1.3 URI tree
  contents:
  - "3.1.3 URI tree\n   A feature tag may be defined as a URI using the restricted\
    \ character\n   set defined above. Feature tags in the URI tree are identified\
    \ by the\n   leading facet \"u.\". The leading facet u. is followed by a URI [9]\n\
    \   which conforms to the character limitations specified in this\n   document.\
    \  The author of the URI is assumed to be registration\n   authority regarding\
    \ features defined and described by the content of\n   the URI.  These tags are\
    \ considered unregistered for the purpose of\n   this document.\n"
- title: 3.1.4 Additional registration trees
  contents:
  - "3.1.4 Additional registration trees\n   From time to time and as required by\
    \ the community, the IANA may,\n   with the advice and consent of the IESG, create\
    \ new top-level\n   registration trees. These trees may be created for external\n\
    \   registration and management by (for example) well-known permanent\n   bodies,\
    \ such as scientific societies for media feature types specific\n   to the sciences\
    \ they cover.  Establishment of these new trees will be\n   announced through\
    \ RFC publication approved by the IESG.\n"
- title: 3.2 Location of registered feature tag list
  contents:
  - "3.2 Location of registered feature tag list\n   Feature tag registrations will\
    \ be posted in the anonymous FTP\n   directory:  \"ftp://ftp.isi.edu/in-notes/iana/assignments/media-\n\
    \   feature-tags/\" and all registered feature tags will be listed in the\n  \
    \ periodically issued \"Assigned Numbers\" RFC [currently STD 2, RFC-\n   1700].\
    \  The feature tag description and other supporting material may\n   also be published\
    \ as an Informational RFC by sending it to \"rfc-\n   editor@rfc-editor.org\"\
    .\n"
- title: 3.3 IANA procedures for registering feature tags
  contents:
  - "3.3 IANA procedures for registering feature tags\n   The IANA will only register\
    \ feature tags in the IETF tree in response\n   to a communication from the IESG\
    \ stating that a given registration\n   has been approved.\n   Global tags will\
    \ be registered by the IANA after review by a\n   designated expert.  That review\
    \ will serve to ensure that the tag\n   meets the technical requirements of this\
    \ specification.\n"
