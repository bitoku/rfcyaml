  - "Abstract\n   This document is the result of a survey asking people to detail\
    \ their\n   advanced usages of X.500. It is intended to show how various\n   organizations\
    \ are using X.500 in ways which extend the view of X.500\n   as a \"White Pages\"\
    \ service.  This RFC is a product of the Integrated\n   Directory Services Working\
    \ Group of the Application and User Services\n   Areas of the IETF.\n"

  - "1. Introduction\n   As the use of X.500 spreads in the Internet, organizations\
    \ are\n   finding uses for it which go beyond the \"white pages\" paradigm which\n\
    \   has been used to introduce it to new users. Consequently, to document\n  \
    \ those new uses and to encourage the wider use of X.500, we sent out a\n   survey\
    \ to obtain \"advanced usages\" of X.500.\n"

    \ integrating the time-table information\n     services offered by public transport\
    \ providers of different scope\n     (local, regional, national or international)\
    \ into a homogeneous and\n     unified user interface.  X.500 is used to store\
    \ the information in\n     an autonomous and extensible way.\n   Full Description:\n\
    \     Most of the public tranport providers offer some kind of time-table\n  \
    \   information service like printed directory, help-desk, telephone\n     support\
    \ or PC software. Unfortunately these services have some of\n     the following\
    \ drawbacks:\n         - no automatic update of data (information accuracy)\n\
    \         - no global availability (place independency)\n         - no permanent\
    \ availability (time independency)\n         - no inter-provider service (service\
    \ integration).\n     X.500 may serve as a vehicle to overcome these drawbacks\
    \ as\n     follows: The public transport providers store the time-table\n    \
    \ information in a standardized format on locally managed DSAs. There\n     is\
    \ some kind of special purpose DUA which (1) queries the user for\n     the input\
    \ parameters (date, time, source and destination station)\n     then (2) searches\
    \ for the relevant paths by querying the involved\n     DSAs and (3) displays\
    \ the resulting time-table to the user.\n     In a diploma thesis a student is\
    \ developing a new data model which\n     supports easy selection of source and\
    \ destination station as well\n     as fast exploring of the time-table information.\
    \ He is implementing\n     a prototype application onto an existing DUA interface\
    \ (based on\n     HyperCard and running on Apple Macintosh) which is connected\
    \ to the\n     world-wide X.500 pilot service over DIXIE protocol.  In order to\n\
    \     test the prototype application the time-table information of the\n     Swiss\
    \ national public transport company and of most of the regional\n     providers\
    \ around the city of Zurich is included under the branch:\n     c=CH;o=ETH Zurich.\n"

    \ (EDI). EDI is\n     the transfer of trade documents between application processes\
    \ in a\n     processable form.  The 'first order' problem describes the\n    \
    \ agreements that two organizations must come to regarding\n     capabilities\
    \ and preferences, before using EDI.\n     To solve this problem we defined object\
    \ types to allow the storage\n     of product catalogues within the Directory,\
    \ as well as information\n     about the EDI readiness of trading partners: addresses,\
    \ preferences\n     and EDI capabilities.\n   Full Description:\n     Electronic\
    \ Data Interchange (EDI) is the means by which\n     organizations exchange trade\
    \ related documents between application\n     processes in an format which may\
    \ be processed electronically.\n     Before using EDI an organization must establish\
    \ a series of goals\n     and objectives, to establish what type of documents\
    \ they wish to be\n     able to transmit (invoices, purchase orders etc.) and\
    \ what their\n     communication requirements are. Each of these time consuming\
    \ and\n     tedious steps is usually done in conjunction with trading partners\n\
    \     where these agreements regarding EDI capabilities and preferences\n    \
    \ must be made.\n     To solve this 'first order' problem (the need to come to\
    \ agreements\n     with other organizations before trading using EDI takes place)\
    \ we\n     defined object types to allow the storage of product catalogues\n \
    \    within the Directory. The Directory may also convey information\n     regarding\
    \ the EDI readiness of trading partners: addresses,\n     preferences and EDI\
    \ capabilities.\n     Using an experimental User Agent based on Pod which was\
    \ developed\n     at Brunel in the UK, trade documents may be built up by selecting\n\
    \     products from the stored catalogues. These documents are then\n     encoded\
    \ as an EDI Interchange after the Directory has been queried\n     about addresses,\
    \ etc.\n     The current object types are very basic and may only convey the\n\
    \     minimal amount of information necessary. We are now in the process\n   \
    \  of extending this further to a full product class hierarchy which\n     is\
    \ being based on information that may be sent within an EDI trade\n     document\
    \ using the EDI standard document syntax EDIFACT.\n     By using the Directory\
    \ as a repository for product information to\n     aid in EDI the catalogues become\
    \ available worldwide. They may be\n     replicated at various nodes, and the\
    \ updating and propagation of\n     changes to slave copies becomes trivial.\n"

    \  To this end, we are working on loading\n     the NSFNET network information\
    \ into X.500 in anticipation of\n     participating in a distributed database\
    \ trial.\n   Full Description:\n     The Shared Whois Project is a collection\

    \ Merit,\n     the RIPE-NCC and the InterNIC.  The principal purpose of merging\n\
    \     this vast quantity of data is to find and resolve conflicting\n     network\
    \ information between the various databases.  It is our\n     intent to merge\
    \ this data bi-weekly and thus rapidly reach, and\n     thereafter maintain, a\
    \ stable set of commonly held network\n     information.\n     While there is\
    \ a common set of information all three of the\n     participants hold in their\
    \ various databases, additional\n     information unique to the function of each\
    \ organization is also\n     held.  Furthermore, the resulting set of data created\
    \ by the merger\n     holds only one entry per network without attempting to combine\
    \ the\n     variations.  Thus, each entry includes a listing of all databases\n\
    \     found to contain information for that network as well as all\n     databases\
    \ found to be in conflict with the entry held in the\n     resultant set.\n  \

    \     With the growing of number and size of electronic archives for\n     documents,\
    \ programs and the like, the problem of finding and\n     retrieving a specific\
    \ file becomes more and more complex.\n     Furthermore, bandwidth in the Internet\
    \ is still limited. Users\n     should be encouraged and supported to do local\
    \ FTP sessions as often\n     as possible instead of getting everything from the\
    \ other end of the\n     world (i.e., the net).\n     The Soft Pages Project combines\
    \ an Archie-like file look-up service\n     with network configuration knowledge.\
    \  A dedicated User Agent gives\n     a suggestion how to retrieve a document\
    \ in a network traffic\n     optimized manner.\n     Basically, Directory information\
    \ introduced by Soft Pages falls\n     into two parts: A file information part\
    \ and a network configuration\n     part.\n     The file information part describes\
    \ objects and attributes for file\n     servers and their contents. For each file\
    \ server, names and\n     attributes of its files are stored and updated periodically.\
    \ This\n     provides global access to Archie-like information for all\n     registered\
    \ file servers and, furthermore, opens the way to store\n     document description\
    \ together with the file name.  Thus, document\n     search is not restricted\
    \ to file name matches but might be run for\n     keywords as well.\n     The\
    \ network configuration part provides information on networks\n     (subnetworks),\
    \ nodes and lines in the Internet. Furthermore, IP\n     numbers can be mapped\
    \ to network and node objects. In order to\n     evaluate file server sites, Internet\
    \ (site to site) connections are\n     given a cost index and then alternatives\
    \ are compared by their cost\n     index. Cost index is a calculated parameter\
    \ representing properties\n     of a connection like speed, average traffic, charges\
    \ etc. where\n     values for the latter are hold as attributes to line objects.\n\
    \     If a document is stored at two or more sites, the site with the\n     lowest\
    \ cost index (which naturally will be the \"nearest\" in network\n     terms)\
    \ will be chosen for retrieval.  A Soft Pages User Agent\n     basically interacts\
    \ with the Directory for finding a pointer to the\n     \"best\" copy of a file\
    \ wanted by a user.\n"

    \ \"room\" will be a different entry, and modify\n     operations will be used\

    \   9) Templates.  The directory is used to store template entries.\n     Our\
    \ DUA then uses this template when adding new users.  Very\n     useful, as a\
    \ number of default attributes can be set.\n     10) Editors.  Special purpose\
    \ editors for a number of complex\n     attribute syntaxes are built in to our\

    \ Services) Clearinghouse\n     directory to provide access to Xerox Corporation's\
    \ Clearinghouse via\n     X.500 DUAs.\n   Full Description:\n     Xerox uses the\
    \ XNS network protocol suite to provide Mail, Filing,\n     Directory, Authentication,\
    \ etc. network services for the installed\n     based of 45,000+ Xerox workstations.\
    \  The Directory is based on the\n     XNS Clearinghouse protocol which is similar\
    \ to X.500 in that it\n     contains objects which have properties (attributes)\
    \ and is a fully\n     distributed, replicatable directory.  The searching capabilities\
    \ of\n     the Clearinghouse protocol are not as robust as the X.500 search\n\
    \     operation and the physical structure of the original database is\n     not\
    \ amenable to complex searches as it could be if it were stored\n     in a relational\
    \ database.\n     The first piece of this project is to transfer the data into\
    \ an\n     Oracle relational database and create a new Clearinghouse server\n\
    \     which accesses the oracle database and is a full fledged member of\n   \
    \  the Clearinghouse, sending and receiving updates to other servers\n     using\
    \ the XNS Clearinghouse protocol.  This will allow powerful SQL\n     queries\
    \ to be performed on the data which will provide some very\n     desired functionality\
    \ such as: list all of the Distribution Lists\n     of which this name is a member.\n\
    \     To build on the new database, we are probing the implementation of\n   \
    \  an X.500 DSA interface to the Oracle Clearinghouse Directory.  This\n     would\
    \ allow X.500 DUAs to access the data and utilize the powerful\n     search operations.\
    \  It will require the definition of one or more\n     new object classes and\
    \ several new attributes and some thought\n     about the appropriate schema.\n"

    \ in conjunction with X.400 and Open Document\n     Architecture (ODA) to provide\
    \ transparent translation of compound\n     documents between a sender and one\
    \ or more recipients.\n   Full Description:\n     In the future, MITRE would like\
    \ to combine X.500, X.400 and Open\n     Document Architecture (ODA) to automate\
    \ the conversion of compound\n     documents in such a way that the users need\
    \ not know about ODA or\n     even that the conversion is taking place.  This\
    \ will require new\n     and/or updated X.400 products.\n     A preferred compound\
    \ document format (e.g., Microsoft Word,\n     FrameMaker, etc.)  for each user\
    \ is stored in the X.500 directory.\n     Each X.400 Message Transfer Agent (MTA)\
    \ host also houses converters\n     between each such format and the Open Document\
    \ Interchange Format\n     (ODIF).\n     A user (sender) creates a document with\
    \ his or her preferred\n     compound document editor.  Ideally, the editor software\
    \ will have a\n     link (e.g., button or pull-down menu) to the X.400 User Agent\
    \ (UA).\n     The user invokes the X.400 UA (either using this link, or outside\n\
    \     of the editor software) to send the document as an X.400 message to\n  \
    \   one or more recipients.  Next, the document may need to be\n     converted\
    \ to ODIF, and this may be done in one of two ways.\n     Preferably, the X.400\
    \ MTA will be responsible for the ODIF\n     conversion.  The UA must somehow\
    \ be told what format the original\n     document is in.  This may be done via\
    \ the UA invocation from inside\n     the editor, via a UA configuration file,\
    \ by examining the filename\n     extension, etc.  It then tags the document to\
    \ indicate the\n     document's original format using one of the body parts:\n\
    \     \"Bilaterally Defined\" (body part 14), \"Nationally Defined\" (body\n \
    \    part 7) or \"Externally Defined\" (body part 15).  The UA then sends\n  \
    \   the message, and the MTA interprets the tag to determine the\n     document's\
    \ format.\n     For messages internal to MITRE, the MTA will look up the\n   \
    \  recipient's preferred document format.  If it is different than the\n     sender's\
    \ format, the MTA calls the appropriate ODIF converter and\n     sends the message.\
    \  If the recipient's preferred format is the same\n     as that of the document\
    \ being sent, then no conversion is\n     performed.  For messages going outside\
    \ MITRE, the document is\n     always converted to ODIF.  The user may prevent\
    \ this by specifying\n     that the enclosed document is not to be converted,\
    \ in which case\n     the UA simply sends the document in binary form with no\
    \ special\n     tag.\n     Alternatively, the UA may do the conversion.  As above,\
    \ the UA must\n     be told the document's original format.  The UA may then call\
    \ the\n     appropriate local ODIF converter, and then send the message.  There\n\
    \     are some disadvantages to this approach:\n       1) ODIF converters must\
    \ be purchased for and maintained on many\n          more hosts;\n       2) the\
    \ document is always converted to ODIF (unless the UA\n          accesses the\
    \ directory, but...);\n       3) conversion overhead could be traumatic on a small\
    \ PC.\n     At each recipient host, the X.400 MTA catches the incoming message,\n\
    \     recognizing the contents as ODIF.  It then looks up the recipients'\n  \
    \   preferred compound document formats, calls the appropriate\n     converters\
    \ to translate the contents, and then delivers the\n     messages to the recipients.\
    \  If the incoming message contains one\n     of the format tags described above,\
    \ then no conversion is performed\n     (since the document is not in ODIF).\n\
    \     Please note that MITRE is a not-for-profit organization.  We will\n    \
    \ not produce commercial products to support this scenario, but we\n     are anxious\
    \ to encourage and work with companies interested in\n     doing so.\n"
