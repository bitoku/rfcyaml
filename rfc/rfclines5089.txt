Abstract There are various circumstances where it is highly desirable for a Path Computation Client (PCC) to be able to dynamically and automatically discover a set of Path Computation Elements (PCEs), along with information that can be used by the PCC for PCE selection.
When the PCE is a Label Switching Router (LSR) participating in the Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP), or even a server participating passively in the IGP, a simple and efficient way to announce PCEs consists of using IGP flooding.
For that purpose, this document defines extensions to the Intermediate System to Intermediate System (IS IS) routing protocol for the advertisement of PCE Discovery information within an IS IS area or within the entire IS IS routing domain.
Introduction [RFC4655] describes the motivations and architecture for a Path Computation Element (PCE)
based path computation model for Multi Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) and Generalized MPLS (GMPLS)
Traffic Engineered Label Switched Paths (TE LSPs).
The model allows for the separation of the PCE from a Path Computation Client (PCC) (also referred to as a non co located PCE) and allows for cooperation between PCEs (where one PCE acts as a PCC to make requests of the other PCE).
This relies on a communication protocol between a PCC and PCE, and also between PCEs.
The requirements for such a communication protocol can be found in [RFC4657], and the communication protocol is defined in [PCEP].
The PCE architecture requires that a PCC be aware of the location of one or more PCEs in its domain, and, potentially, of PCEs in other domains, e.g., in the case of inter domain TE LSP computation.
A network may contain a large number of PCEs, each with potentially distinct capabilities.
In such a context, it is highly desirable to have a mechanism for automatic and dynamic PCE discovery that allows PCCs to automatically discover a set of PCEs, along with additional information about each PCE that may be used by a PCC to perform PCE selection.
Additionally, it is valuable for a PCC to dynamically detect new PCEs, failed PCEs, or any modification to the PCE information.
Detailed requirements for such a PCE discovery mechanism are provided in [RFC4674].
Note that the PCE selection algorithm applied by a PCC is out of the scope of this document.
When PCCs are LSRs participating in the IGP (OSPF or IS IS), and PCEs are either LSRs or servers also participating in the IGP, an effective mechanism for PCE discovery within an IGP routing domain consists of utilizing IGP advertisements.
This document defines extensions to IS IS [ISO] to allow a PCE in an IS IS routing domain to advertise its location, along with some information useful to a PCC for PCE selection, so as to satisfy dynamic PCE discovery requirements set forth in [RFC4674].
Generic capability advertisement mechanisms for IS IS are defined in [RFC4971].
These allow a router to advertise its capabilities within an IS IS area or
an entire IS IS routing domain.
This document leverages this generic capability advertisement mechanism to fully satisfy the dynamic PCE discovery requirements.
This document defines a new sub TLV (named the PCE Discovery (PCED)) to be carried within the IS IS Router Capability TLV ([RFC4971]).
The PCE information advertised is detailed in Section 3.
Protocol extensions and procedures are defined in Sections 4 and 5.
The IS IS extensions defined in this document allow for PCE discovery within an IS IS routing domain.
Solutions for PCE discovery across AS boundaries are beyond the scope of this document, and are for further study.
This document defines a set of sub TLVs that are nested within each other.
When the degree of nesting TLVs is 2 (a TLV is carried within another TLV)
the TLV carried within a TLV is called a sub TLV.
Strictly speaking, when the degree of nesting is 3, a sub sub TLV is carried within a sub TLV that is itself carried within a TLV.
For the sake of terminology simplicity, a TLV carried within another TLV is called a sub TLV regardless of the degree of nesting.
Terminology ABR: IS IS Area Border Router.
Either of the two routing protocols
, Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) or Intermediate System to Intermediate system (IS IS).
A TE LSP whose path does not cross an IGP area boundary.
A TE LSP whose path does not cross an AS boundary.
Inter area TE LSP: A TE LSP whose path transits two or more IGP areas.
That is, a TE LSP that crosses at least one IGP area boundary.
A TE LSP whose path transits two or more ASes or sub ASes (BGP confederations).
That is, a TE LSP that crosses at least one AS boundary.
Any client application requesting a path computation to be performed by a Path Computation Element.
An entity (component, application, or network node) that is capable of computing a network path or route based on a network graph and applying computational constraints.
PCE Domain: In a PCE context, this refers to any collection of network elements within a common sphere of address management or path computational responsibility (referred to as a "domain" in [RFC4655]).
Examples of PCE Domains include IGP areas and ASes.
This should be distinguished from an IS IS routing domain as defined by [ISO].
Path Computation Element communication Protocol.
TE LSP: Traffic Engineered Label Switched Path.
TLV: Type Length Variable data encoding.
The PCE discovery information is composed of:  The PCE location: an IPv4 and/or IPv6 address that is used to reach the PCE.
It is RECOMMENDED to use an address that is always reachable if there is any connectivity to the PCE;
The PCE path computation scope (i.e., intra layer, inter area, inter AS, or inter layer);  The set of one or more PCE Domain(s) into which the PCE has visibility and for which the PCE can compute paths;  The set of zero, one, or more neighbor PCE Domain(s) toward which the PCE can compute paths;  A set of communication capabilities (e.g., support for request prioritization) and path computation specific capabilities (e.g., supported constraints).
PCE discovery information is, by nature, fairly static and does not change with PCE activity.
Changes in PCE discovery information may occur as a result of PCE configuration updates, PCE deployment/activation, PCE deactivation/suppression, or PCE failure.
Hence, this information is not expected to change frequently.
The flooding scope for PCE information advertised through IS IS
can be a single L1 area, an L1 area and the L2 sub domain, or
the entire IS IS routing domain.
TLV contains a non ordered set of sub TLVs.
The format of the IS IS PCED sub TLV and
its sub TLVs is identical to the TLV format used by the Traffic Engineering Extensions to IS IS [RFC3784].
That is, the TLV is comprised of 1 octet for the type, 1 octet specifying the TLV length, and a value field.
The Length field defines the length of the value portion in octets.
sub TLV has the following format: TYPE:   5 LENGTH: Variable VALUE:
Set of sub TLVs Five
The PCE ADDRESS and PATH SCOPE sub TLVs MUST always be present within the PCED sub TLV.
The PCE DOMAIN and NEIG PCE DOMAIN sub TLVs are optional.
They MAY be present in the PCED sub TLV to facilitate selection of inter domain PCEs.
The PCE CAP FLAGS sub TLV is optional and MAY be present in the PCED sub TLV to facilitate the PCE selection process.
Any unrecognized sub TLV MUST be silently ignored.
The PCED sub TLV is carried within an IS IS
CAPABILITY TLV defined in [RFC4971].
No additional sub TLVs will be added to the PCED TLV in the future.
If a future application requires the advertisement of additional PCE information in IS IS, this will not be carried in the CAPABILITY TLV.
The following sub sections describe the sub TLVs that may be carried within the PCED sub TLV.
The PCE ADDRESS sub TLV specifies an IP address that can be used to reach the PCE.
It is RECOMMENDED to make use of an address that is always reachable, provided the PCE is alive and reachable.
The PCE ADDRESS sub TLV is mandatory; it MUST be present within the PCED sub TLV.
It MAY appear twice, when the PCE has both an IPv4 and IPv6 address.
It MUST NOT appear more than once for the same address type.
If it appears more than once for the same address type, only the first occurrence is processed and any others MUST be ignored.
The PCE ADDRESS sub TLV
has the following format: TYPE:   1 LENGTH: 5 for an IPv4 address or 17 for an IPv6 address.
This comprises one octet indicating the address type and 4 or 16 octets encoding the IPv4 or IPv6 address to be used to reach the PCE.
Address type: 1   IPv4 2   IPv6 4.2.
TLV indicates the PCE path computation scope, which refers to the PCE's ability to compute or take part in the computation of paths for intra area, inter area, inter AS, or inter layer TE LSPs.
The PATH SCOPE sub TLV is mandatory; it MUST be present within the PCED sub TLV.
There MUST be exactly one instance of the PATH SCOPE
sub TLV within each PCED
If it appears more than once only the first occurrence is processed and any others MUST be ignored.
TLV contains a set of bit flags indicating the supported path scopes, and four fields indicating PCE preferences.
The PATH SCOPE sub TLV
has the following format: TYPE:   2 LENGTH: 3 VALUE:
This comprises a 1 octet flags field where each flag represents a supported path scope, followed by a 2 octet preferences field indicating PCE preferences.
L bit:  Can compute intra area paths.
Rd bit: Can act as a default PCE for inter area TE LSP computation.
Sd bit: Can act as a default PCE for inter AS TE LSP computation.
Y bit:  Can act as PCE for inter layer TE LSP computation.
7   Reserved for future use.
PCE's preference for intra area TE LSP computation.
PCE's preference for inter area TE LSP computation.
PrefS field: PCE's preference for inter AS TE LSP computation.
Pref Y field: PCE's preference for inter layer TE LSP computation.
Res: Reserved for future use.
The L, R, S, and Y bits are set when the PCE can act as a PCE for intra area, inter area, inter AS, or inter layer TE LSP computation, respectively.
These bits are non exclusive.
When set, the Rd bit indicates that the PCE can act as a default PCE for inter area TE LSP computation (that is, the PCE can compute a path toward any neighbor area).
Similarly, when set, the Sd bit indicates that the PCE can act as a default PCE for inter AS TE LSP computation (the PCE can compute a path toward any neighbor AS).
When the Rd and Sd bit are set, the PCED sub TLV
MUST NOT contain a NEIG PCE DOMAIN
sub TLV (see Section 4.4).
When the R bit is clear, the Rd bit SHOULD be clear on transmission and MUST be ignored on receipt.
When the S bit is clear, the Sd bit SHOULD be clear on transmission and MUST be ignored on receipt.
The PrefL, PrefR, PrefS and PrefY fields are each three bits long and allow the PCE to specify a preference for each computation scope, where 7 reflects the highest preference.
Such preferences can be used for weighted load balancing of path computation requests.
An operator may decide to configure a preference for each computation scope at each PCE so as to balance the path computation load among them.
The algorithms used by a PCC to balance its path computation requests according to such PCE preferences are out of the scope of this document and are a matter for local or network wide policy.
The same or different preferences may be used for each scope.
For instance, an operator that wants a PCE capable of both inter area and inter AS computation to be preferred for use for inter AS computations may configure PrefS higher than PrefR.
When the L, R, S, or Y bits are cleared, the PrefL, PrefR, PrefS, and PrefY fields SHOULD respectively be set to 0 on transmission and MUST be ignored on receipt.
Both reserved fields SHOULD be set to zero on transmission and MUST be ignored on receipt.
TLV specifies a PCE Domain (area and/or AS) where the PCE has topology visibility and through which the PCE can compute paths.
TLV SHOULD be present when PCE Domains for which the PCE can operate cannot be inferred by other IGP information: for instance, when the PCE is inter domain capable (i.e., when the R bit or S bit is set) and the flooding scope is the entire routing domain (see Section 5 for a discussion of how the flooding scope is set and interpreted).
A PCED sub TLV may include multiple PCE DOMAIN sub TLVs when the PCE has visibility into multiple PCE Domains.
The PCE DOMAIN sub TLV
has the following format: TYPE:   3 LENGTH: Variable VALUE:
This is composed of one octet indicating the domain type (area ID or AS Number) and a variable length IS
IS area ID or a 32 bit AS number, identifying a PCE Domain where the PCE has visibility and can compute paths.
Two domain types are defined: 1   Area ID 2
The Area ID is the area address as defined in [ISO].
When the AS number is coded in two octets, the AS Number field MUST have its first two octets set to 0.
The NEIG PCE DOMAIN sub
TLV specifies a neighbor PCE Domain (area or AS) toward which a PCE can compute paths.
It means that the PCE can take part in the computation of inter domain TE LSPs with paths that transit this neighbor PCE Domain.
A PCED sub TLV may include several NEIG PCE DOMAIN sub TLVs when the PCE can compute paths towards several neighbor PCE Domains.
The NEIG PCE DOMAIN sub TLV
has the same format as the PCE DOMAIN sub TLV:
TYPE:   4 LENGTH: Variable VALUE:
This comprises one octet indicating the domain type (area ID or AS Number) and
a variable length IS IS area ID or a 32 bit AS number, identifying a PCE Domain toward which the PCE can compute paths.
Two domain types are defined: 1   Area ID 2
The Area ID is the area address as defined in [ISO].
When the AS number is coded in two octets, the AS Number field MUST have its first two octets set to 0.
The NEIG PCE DOMAIN sub TLV
MUST be present at least once with domain type set to 1 if the R bit is set and the Rd bit is cleared, and MUST be present at least once with domain type set to 2 if the S bit is set and the Sd bit is cleared.
The PCE CAP FLAGS sub TLV is
an optional sub TLV used to indicate PCE capabilities.
It MAY be present within the PCED sub TLV.
It MUST NOT be present more than once.
If it appears more than once, only the first occurrence is processed and any others MUST be ignored.
The value field of the PCE CAP FLAGS sub TLV is made up of an array of units of 32 bit flags numbered from the most significant bit as bit zero, where each bit represents one PCE capability.
The PCE CAP FLAGS sub TLV has the following format: TYPE:   5 LENGTH:
This contains an array of units of 32 bit flags numbered from the most significant as bit zero, where each bit represents one PCE capability.
The PCE capability registry is managed by IANA; it is common with OSPF and defined in [RFC5088].
Reserved bits SHOULD be set to zero on transmission and MUST be ignored on receipt.
The PCED sub TLV is advertised within an IS IS
Router Capability TLV defined in [RFC4971].
As such, elements of procedures are inherited from those defined in [RFC4971].
The flooding scope is controlled by the S flag in the IS IS Router Capability TLV (see [RFC4971]).
When the scope of the PCED sub TLV is area local, it MUST be carried within an IS IS
Router Capability TLV having the S bit cleared.
When the scope of the PCED sub TLV is the entire IS IS routing domain, it MUST be carried within an IS IS
Router Capability TLV having the S bit set.
Note that when only the L bit of the PATH SCOPE sub TLV is set, the flooding scope MUST be area local.
Note that an L1L2 node may include a PCED TLV in a Router Capability TLV with the S bit cleared in both in its L1 and L2 LSPs.
This allows the flooding scope to be restricted to the L1 area and the L2 sub domain.
When the PCE function is deactivated, the IS IS speaker advertising
this PCE MUST originate a new IS IS LSP that no longer includes the corresponding PCED TLV.
The PCE address (i.e., the address indicated within the PCE ADDRESS sub TLV) SHOULD be reachable via some prefixes advertised by IS IS.
The PCED sub TLV information regarding a specific PCE is only considered current and useable when the router advertising this information is itself reachable via
IS IS calculated paths at the level of the LSP in which the PCED sub TLV appears.
A change in the state of a PCE (activate, deactivate, parameter change) MUST result in a corresponding change in the PCED sub TLV information advertised by an IS IS router (inserted, removed, updated) in its LSP.
The way PCEs determine the information they advertise, and how that information is made available to IS IS, is out of the scope of this document.
Some information may be configured (e.g., address, preferences, scope) and other information may be automatically determined by the PCE (e.g., areas of visibility).
A change in information in the PCED sub
TLV MUST NOT trigger any SPF computation at a receiving router.
TLV defined in this document does not introduce any interoperability issues.
An IS IS router not supporting the PCED sub TLV will just silently ignore the sub TLV as specified in [RFC4971].
IANA Considerations IANA has defined a registry for the sub TLVs carried in the IS IS
Router Capability TLV defined in [RFC4971].
IANA has assigned a new sub TLV codepoint for the PCED sub
TLV carried within the Router Capability TLV.
This document defines IS IS extensions for PCE discovery within an administrative domain.
Hence the security of the PCE discovery relies on the security of IS IS.
Mechanisms defined to ensure authenticity and integrity of IS IS LSPs [RFC3567] and their TLVs, can be used to secure the PCED sub TLV as well.
IS IS provides no encryption mechanism for protecting the privacy of LSPs and, in particular, the privacy of the PCE discovery information.
Manageability Considerations Manageability considerations for PCE Discovery are addressed in Section 4.10 of [RFC4674].
Control of Policy and Functions Requirements for the configuration of PCE discovery parameters on PCCs and PCEs are discussed in Section 4.10.1 of [RFC4674].
In particular, a PCE implementation SHOULD allow the following parameters to be configured on the PCE:
The PCE Scope, including the inter domain functions (inter area, inter AS, inter layer), the preferences, and whether the PCE can act as default PCE (see Section 4.2).
The PCE Domains (see Section 4.3).
The neighbor PCE Domains (see Section 4.4).
The PCE capabilities (see Section 4.5).
9.2.  Information and Data Model
A MIB module for PCE Discovery is defined in [PCED MIB].
This document specifies the use of IS IS as a PCE Discovery Protocol.
The requirements specified in [RFC4674] include the ability to determine liveness of the PCE Discovery protocol.
Normal operation of the IS IS protocol meets these requirements.
The correlation of information advertised against information received can be achieved by comparing the information in the PCED sub TLV received by the PCC with that stored at the PCE using the PCED MIB [PCED MIB].
The number of dropped, corrupt, and rejected information elements are available through the PCED MIB.
Requirements on Other Protocols and Functional Components
extensions defined in this document do not imply any requirements on other protocols.
Impact on Network Operations Frequent changes in PCE information advertised in the PCED sub TLV may have a significant impact on IS IS and might destabilize the operation of the network by causing the PCCs to swap between PCEs.
As discussed in Section 4.10.4 of [RFC4674], it MUST be possible to apply at least the following controls:  Configurable limit on the rate of announcement of changed parameters at a PCE.
Control of the impact on PCCs, such as through rate limiting the processing of PCED sub TLVs.
Configurable control of triggers that cause a PCC to swap to another PCE.
