- title: 1.1.  Problem Statement
  contents:
  - "1.1.  Problem Statement\n   Dynamic DNS (DDNS) is a widely deployed service to\
    \ facilitate hosting\n   servers (e.g., access to a webcam, HTTP server, FTP server,\
    \ etc.) at\n   customers' premises.  There are a number of providers that offer\
    \ a\n   DDNS service, working in a client and server mode, which mostly use\n\
    \   web-form-based communication.  DDNS clients are generally implemented\n  \
    \ in the user's router or computer; once changes are detected to its\n   assigned\
    \ IP address, an update message is automatically sent to the\n   DDNS server.\
    \  The communication between the DDNS client and the DDNS\n   server is not standardized,\
    \ varying from one provider to another,\n   although a few standard web-based\
    \ methods of updating have emerged\n   over time.\n   In address-sharing contexts,\
    \ well-known port numbers (e.g., port 80)\n   won't be available for every user\
    \ [RFC6269].  As such, the DDNS\n   client will have to register the IP address\
    \ and/or the external\n   port(s) on which the service is listening.  Also, the\
    \ DDNS client has\n   to report any change of this IP address and/or the external\
    \ port(s).\n   It will also require the ability to configure corresponding port\n\
    \   forwarding on Carrier-Grade NAT (CGN) [RFC6888] devices so that\n   incoming\
    \ communications initiated from the Internet can be routed to\n   the appropriate\
    \ server behind the CGN.\n   Issues encountered in address sharing are documented\
    \ in [RFC6269].\n   This document focuses on the problems encountered when using\
    \ dynamic\n   DNS in address-sharing contexts (e.g., DS-Lite [RFC6333] and NAT64\n\
    \   [RFC6146]).  The main challenges are listed below:\n   Announce and discover\
    \ an alternate service port:  The DDNS service\n      must be able to maintain\
    \ an alternative port number instead of the\n      default port number.\n   Allow\
    \ for incoming connections:  Appropriate means to instantiate\n      port mappings\
    \ in the address-sharing device must be supported.\n   Detect changes and trigger\
    \ DDNS updates:  The DDNS client must be\n      triggered by the change of the\
    \ external IP address and the port\n      number.  Concretely, upon change of\
    \ the external IP address (and/\n      or external port number), the DDNS client\
    \ must refresh the DNS\n      records; otherwise, the server won't be reachable\
    \ from outside.\n      This issue is exacerbated in the DS-Lite context because\
    \ no public\n      IPv4 address is assigned to the Customer Premises Equipment\
    \ (CPE).\n"
- title: 1.2.  Scope and Goals
  contents:
  - "1.2.  Scope and Goals\n   This document describes some candidate solutions to\
    \ resolve the\n   aforementioned issues with a particular focus on DS-Lite.  These\n\
    \   solutions may also be valid for other address-sharing schemes.\n   This document\
    \ sketches deployment considerations based on the Port\n   Control Protocol (PCP)\
    \ [RFC6887].  Note that DDNS may be considered\n   as an implementation of the\
    \ rendezvous service mentioned in\n   [RFC6887].\n   Indeed, after creating an\
    \ explicit mapping for incoming connections\n   using PCP, it is necessary to\
    \ inform remote hosts about the IP\n   address, protocol, and port number for\
    \ the incoming connection to\n   reach the services hosted behind a DS-Lite CGN.\
    \  This is usually done\n   in an application-specific manner.  For example, a\
    \ machine hosting a\n   game server might use a rendezvous server specific to\
    \ that game (or\n   specific to that game developer), a SIP phone would use a\
    \ SIP proxy,\n   a client using DNS-Based Service Discovery [RFC6763] would use\
    \ DNS\n   Update [RFC2136][RFC3007], etc.  PCP does not provide this rendezvous\n\
    \   function.\n   The rendezvous function may support IPv4, IPv6, or both.  Depending\n\
    \   on that support and the application's support of IPv4 or IPv6, the\n   PCP\
    \ client may need an IPv4 mapping, an IPv6 mapping, or both.  An\n   example illustrating\
    \ how the DDNS server may implement such a service\n   notification functionality\
    \ if necessary is provided in Section 3.\n   This document does not specify any\
    \ protocol extension but instead\n   focuses on the elaboration of the problem\
    \ space and illustrates how\n   existing tools can be reused to solve the problem\
    \ for some deployment\n   contexts.  Particularly, this document requires no changes\
    \ to PCP or\n   dynamic updates in the standard domain name system [RFC2136];\
    \ rather,\n   it is an operational document to make the current DDNS service\n\
    \   providers aware of the impacts and issues that IPv6 transitioning and\n  \
    \ IPv4 address sharing will bring to them, and it gives solutions to\n   address\
    \ the forthcoming issues.  The current DDNS service providers\n   usually employ\
    \ a web-based form to maintain DDNS service registration\n   and updates.\n  \
    \ Generic deployment considerations for DS-Lite, including Basic\n   Bridging\
    \ BroadBand (B4) remote management and IPv4 connectivity\n   check, can be found\
    \ in [RFC6908].  This document complements\n   [RFC6908] with deployment considerations\
    \ related to rendezvous\n   service maintenance.  Additional PCP-related deployment\n\
    \   considerations are available at [PCP-DEPLOYMENT].\n   Solutions relying on\
    \ DNS-Based Service Discovery [RFC6763] or Apple's\n   Back to My Mac (BTMM) Service\
    \ [RFC6281] are not considered in this\n   document.  Moreover, this document\
    \ does not assume that DDNS service\n   relies on [RFC2136].\n   IPv4 addresses\
    \ used in the examples are derived from the IPv4 block\n   reserved for documentation\
    \ in [RFC6890].  DNS name examples follow\n   [RFC2606].\n"

- title: 2.1.  Locate a Service Port
  contents:
  - "2.1.  Locate a Service Port\n   As listed below, at least two solutions can be\
    \ used to associate a\n   port number with a service:\n   1.  Use service URIs\
    \ (e.g., FTP, SIP, HTTP) that embed an explicit\n       port number.  Indeed,\
    \ the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI)\n       defined in [RFC3986] allows the\
    \ port number to be carried in the\n       syntax (e.g., mydomain.example:15687).\n\
    \   2.  Use SRV records [RFC2782].  Unfortunately, the majority of\n       browsers\
    \ do not support this record type.\n   The DDNS client and DDNS server are to\
    \ be updated so that an\n   alternate port number is signaled and stored by the\
    \ DDNS server.\n   Requesting remote hosts will be then notified with the IP address\
    \ and\n   port number to reach the server.\n"

  contents:
  - "2.2.  Create Explicit Mappings for Incoming Connections\n   PCP is used to install\
    \ the appropriate mapping(s) in the CGN so that\n   incoming packets can be delivered\
    \ to the appropriate server.\n"
- title: 2.3.  Detect Changes
  contents:
  - "2.3.  Detect Changes\n   In a network as described in Figure 1, a DDNS client/PCP\
    \ client can\n   be running on either a CPE or the host that is hosting some services\n\
    \   itself.  There are several possible ways to address the problems\n   stated\
    \ in Section 1.1:\n   1.  If the DDNS client is enabled, the host periodically\
    \ issues\n       (e.g., 60 minutes) PCP MAP requests (e.g., messages 1 and 2 in\n\
    \       Figure 1) with short lifetimes (e.g., 30s) for the purpose of\n      \
    \ inquiring an external IP address and setting.  If the purpose is\n       to\
    \ detect any change to the external port, the host must issue a\n       PCP mapping\
    \ to install for the internal server.  Upon change of\n       the external IP\
    \ address, the DDNS client updates the records\n       accordingly (e.g., message\
    \ 3 in Figure 1).\n   2.  If the DDNS client is enabled, it checks the local mapping\
    \ table\n       maintained by the PCP client.  This process is repeated\n    \
    \   periodically (e.g., 5 minutes, 30 minutes, 60 minutes).  If there\n      \
    \ is no PCP mapping created by the PCP client, it issues a PCP MAP\n       request\
    \ (e.g., messages 1 and 2 in Figure 1) for the purpose of\n       inquiring an\
    \ external IP address and setting up port forwarding\n       mappings for incoming\
    \ connections.  Upon change of the external\n       IP address, the DDNS client\
    \ updates the records in the DDNS\n       server, e.g., message 3 in Figure 1.\n\

    \ that are deployed in the DS-Lite\n      network, or more generally, an IP address-sharing\
    \ environment.\n      They are usually running on a host that has been assigned\
    \ with a\n      private IPv4 address.  Having created a proper mapping via PCP\
    \ in\n      the Address Family Transition Router (AFTR), these services have\n\
    \      been made available to Internet users.  The services may provide\n    \
    \  web, FTP, SIP, and other services though these may not be able to\n      be\
    \ seen as using a well-known port from the outside anymore, in\n      the IP address-sharing\
    \ context.\n   o  B4(CPE): An endpoint of an IPv4-in-IPv6 tunnel [RFC6333].  A\
    \ PCP\n      client together with a DDNS client are running on it.  After a PCP\n\
    \      client establishes a mapping on the AFTR, an end user may register\n  \
    \    its domain name and its external IPv4 address plus port number to\n     \
    \ its DDNS service provider (DDNS server), manually or automatically\n      by\
    \ a DDNS client.  Later, likewise, end users may manually\n      announce or let\
    \ the DDNS client automatically announce IP address\n      and/or port changes\
    \ to the DDNS server.\n   o  AFTR: Responsible for maintaining mappings between\
    \ an IPv6\n      address, the internal IPv4 address plus internal port, and the\n\
    \      external IPv4 address plus port [RFC6333].\n   o  DDNS server: Maintains\
    \ a table that associates a registered domain\n      name and a registered host's\
    \ external IPv4 address/port number\n      pair.  When being notified of IP address\
    \ and port number changes\n      from a DDNS client, the DDNS server announces\
    \ the updates to DNS\n      servers on behalf of the end user.  [RFC2136] and\
    \ [RFC3007] may be\n      used by DDNS servers to send updates to DNS servers.\
    \  In many\n      current practices, a DDNS service provider usually announces\
    \ its\n      own IP address as the registered domain names of end users.  When\n\
    \      HTTP requests reach the DDNS server, they may employ URL\n      Forwarding\
    \ or HTTP 301 redirection to redirect the request to a\n      proper registered\
    \ end user by looking up the maintained link\n      table.\n   o  Service users:\
    \ Refers to users who want to access services behind\n      an IP address-sharing\
    \ network.  They issue standard DNS requests\n      to locate the services, which\
    \ will lead them to a DDNS server,\n      provided that the requested services\
    \ have been registered to a\n      DDNS service provider.  The DDNS server will\

  - "3.3.  For Non-web Service\n   For non-web services, as mentioned in Section 2,\
    \ other means will be\n   needed to inform the users about the service information.\n\
    \   [RFC6763] includes an example of a DNS-based solution that allows an\n   application\
    \ running in the end user's device to retrieve service-\n   related information\
    \ via DNS SRV/TXT records and list available\n   services.  In a scenario where\
    \ such an application is not applicable,\n   the following provides another solution\
    \ for a third party, e.g., a\n   DDNS service provider, to disclose services to\
    \ Internet users.\n   A web portal can be used to list available services.  A\
    \ DDNS server\n   maintains a web portal for each user's Fully Qualified Domain\
    \ Name\n   (FQDN), which provides service links to users.  Figure 4 assumes\n\
    \   \"websrv.example.com\" is a user's FQDN provided by a DDNS service\n   provider.\n\

    \                   Figure 4: Update Web Portal\n   The DDNS client registers\

    \ and port obtained via PCP,\n   the user's FQDN, and other necessary information.\
    \  The DDNS server\n   also behaves as a portal server; it registers its IP address,\
    \ port\n   number, and the user's FQDN to the DNS system so that visitors can\n\
    \   access the web portal.\n   A DDNS server also maintains a web portal for each\
    \ user's FQDN and\n   updates the portal according to registered information from\
    \ the DDNS\n   client.  When a visitor accesses \"websrv.example.com\", a DNS\
    \ query\n   will resolve the portal server's address and port number, and the\n\

    \  Multiple services are accessible per a\n   user's FQDN.\n   Some applications\

  - "4.  Security Considerations\n   This document does not introduce a new protocol,\
    \ nor does it specify\n   protocol extensions.  Security-related considerations\
    \ related to PCP\n   [RFC6887] and DS-Lite [RFC6333] should be taken into account.\n\
    \   The protocol between the DDNS client and DDNS server is proprietary\n   in\
    \ most cases; some extensions may be necessary, which is up to the\n   DDNS operators.\
    \  These operators should enforce security-related\n   policies in order to keep\
    \ illegitimate users from altering records\n   installed by legitimate users or\
    \ installing fake records that would\n   attract illegitimate traffic.  Means\
    \ to protect the DDNS server\n   against Denial of Service (DoS) should be enabled.\
    \  Note that these\n   considerations are not specific to address-sharing contexts\
    \ but are\n   valid for DDNS services in general.\n"
