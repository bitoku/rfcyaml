  - "I.  Introduction\n   As currently defined, NICNAME/WHOIS [HARR85] service is\
    \ a TCP\n   transaction based query/response server, running on a few specific\n\
    \   central machines, that provides netwide directory service to Internet\n  \
    \ users.  The Network Information Center (NIC) maintains the central\n   NICNAME\
    \ database and server, defined in RFC 954, providing online\n   look-up of individuals,\
    \ network organizations, key host machines, and\n   other information of interest\
    \ to users of the Internet.  The\n   usefulness of this service has lead to the\
    \ development of other\n   distributed directory information servers and information\
    \ retrieval\n   tools and it is anticipated more will be created.  Many sites\
    \ now\n   maintain local directory servers with information about individuals,\n\
    \   departments and services at that specific site.\n   Typically these directory\
    \ servers are network accessible.  Local\n   development of these services has\
    \ resulted in wide variations in the\n   type of data stored, access methods,\
    \ search schemes, and user\n   interfaces.  The purpose of the Whois and Network\
    \ Information Lookup\n   Service Working Group (WNILS) is to expand and define\
    \ the standard\n   for WHOIS types of services, to resolve issues associated with\
    \ the\n   variations in access and provide a consistent and predictable service\n\
    \   across the network.  This memo describes new features for WHOIS to\n   meet\
    \ these goals.\n"
- title: II.  Architecture
  contents:
  - "II.  Architecture\n   The WHOIS service should be provided in a client/server\
    \ model.  There\n   are no restrictions on the design of the client, provided\
    \ it is\n   capable of passing queries to the server in the proper format, and\n\
    \   capturing the server's response in some useful format.  Existing\n   WHOIS\
    \ specifications call for clients to display responses in human-\n   readable\
    \ form.  This more general proposal does not impose that\n   restriction.\n  \
    \ This paper acknowledges the existence of many distributed information\n   servers,\
    \ and anticipates the creation of many more. To help users\n   locate WHOIS servers,\
    \ each server should have a nameserver entry in\n   the form \"whois.domain\"\
    , i.e. whois.internic.net.\n"
- title: III.  Client Design and Behavior
  contents:
  - "III.  Client Design and Behavior\n   The client provides the user interface to\
    \ the WHOIS system and a\n   mechanism for query generation and display of the\
    \ response.  The\n   client is responsible for providing support for paging of\
    \ long output\n   from the server.  All clients must provide this service.  The\
    \ server\n   will not include any special characters, or make any efforts to\n\
    \   control output to a screen.\n   Special search criteria may be specified by\
    \ the use of keywords or\n   special characters, some of which are defined in\
    \ RFC 954.  Clients\n   should be designed to make support for quoted strings\
    \ unnecessary.\n"
- title: IV.  Server Design and Behavior
  contents:
  - "IV.  Server Design and Behavior\n   The server should return the same information\
    \ in response to a given\n   query consistently, regardless of the client software\
    \ or the hardware\n   used to originate the query. Queries should be evaluated\
    \ on a case-\n   insensitive basis. Spaces should not be considered in searches.\
    \  A\n   search for \"La Russo\" should return both \"LaRusso\" and \"La Russo\"\
    \ as\n   matches.\n   There are three types of data records supported in this\

- title: Search Options
  contents:
  - "Search Options\n   A unique handle must be provided for every record in the server\n\
    \   database to target specific records for display.  For example, if\n   there\
    \ are three individuals named, respectively, A. La  Russo, B.\n   LaRusso, and\
    \ C. Larusso, then a search for \"LA RUSSO\" would return\n   all three as matches.\
    \  However, each record would have a unique\n   handle, i.e. LARUSSO1, LARUSSO2,\
    \ and LARUSSO3. A search for any one\n   of these handles would return a single\
    \ match for that particular\n   individual.  This is consistent with the RFC 954\

- title: On-line Help
  contents:
  - "On-line Help\n   The client should return a minimal (two line) help message for\

    \ help screens.\n   Additional help should be provided in special situations.\
    \ The server\n   should recognize queries that return zero matches, and provide\
    \ a\n   brief help message explaining how to broaden a search.  If a search\n\
    \   returns more than 50 matches, the server should take two actions.\n   First,\
    \ the user should get a message explaining how to narrow\n   searches.  Second,\
    \ the user should be offered the option of re-\n   specifying the search, or receiving\
    \ all matching responses.  When\n   multiple matches are found and returned to\
    \ the client, the server\n   should add a brief help message explaining how to\
    \ use handles to\n   narrow the search to a single record.\n   If the client queries\
    \ for \"help\" or \"?\" then the server should return\n   a complete help file.\
    \  The help file should contain information in\n   sufficient detail for the user\
    \ to understand and access all the\n   features of WHOIS service.\n"
