- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   SEcure Neighbor Discovery (SEND) [RFC3971] utilizes X.509v3\n\
    \   certificates that include the [RFC3779] extension for IPv6 addresses\n   to\
    \ certify a router's authority over an IPv6 prefix for the NDP\n   (Neighbor Discovery\
    \ Protocol).  The Trust Anchor (TA) option in\n   Section 6.4.3 of [RFC3971] allows\
    \ the identification of the Trust\n   Anchor selected by the host.  In that same\
    \ section, two name types\n   were defined: the DER Encoded X.501 Name and a Fully\
    \ Qualified Domain\n   Name (FQDN).\n   In any Public Key Infrastructure, the\
    \ subject name of a certificate\n   is only unique within each Certification Authority\
    \ (CA).\n   Consequently, a new option to identify TAs across CAs is needed.\n\
    \   In [RFC6494], the certificate profile described in [RFC6487] is\n   adopted\
    \ for SEND.  In these documents, the Subject field in the\n   certificates is\
    \ declared to be meaningless and the subjectAltName\n   field is not allowed.\
    \  On the other hand, the Subject Key Identifier\n   (SKI) extension for the X.509\
    \ certificates is defined as mandatory\n   and non-critical.\n   This document\
    \ specifies new Name Type fields in the SEND TA option\n   that allows the use\
    \ of the SKI X.509 extension to identify TA X.509\n   certificates.  This document\
    \ also defines experimental and reserved\n   Name Types values.\n   Finally, this\
    \ document updates [RFC3971] by changing the \"Trust\n   Anchor option (Type 15)\
    \ Name Type field\" registration procedures from\n   Standards Action to Standards\
    \ Action or IESG Approval [RFC5226].\n"

  contents:
  - "3.  Name Type Fields in the ICMPv6 TA Option Defined in This Document\n   The\
    \ following Name Type fields in the ICMPv6 TA option are defined:\n          \
    \ Name Type      Description\n            0              Reserved\n          \

    \   Name Type field values 0 and 255 are marked as reserved.  This means\n   that\
    \ they are not available for allocation.\n   When the Name Type field is set to\
    \ 3, the Name Type field contains a\n   160-bit SHA-1 hash of the value of the\
    \ DER-encoded ASN.1 bit string\n   of the subject public key, as described in\
    \ Section 4.8.2 of\n   [RFC6487].  Implementations MAY support SHA-1 SKI name\
    \ type.\n   When the Name Type field is set to 4, 5, 6, or 7, the hash function\n\
    \   will respectively be: SHA-224, SHA-256, SHA-384, or SHA-512.\n   Implementations\
    \ MAY support SHA-224, SHA-256, SHA-384, and SHA-512\n   SKI name types.\n   Name\
    \ Type fields 253 and 254 are marked as experimental, per guidance\n   in [RFC3692].\n"
- title: 4.  Processing Rules for Routers
  contents:
  - "4.  Processing Rules for Routers\n   As specified in [RFC3971], a TA is identified\
    \ by the SEND TA option.\n   If the TA option is represented as a SKI, then the\
    \ SKI MUST be equal\n   to the X.509 SKI extension in the trust anchor's certificate.\
    \  The\n   router SHOULD include the TA option(s) in the advertisement for which\n\
    \   the certification path was found.  Also, following the specification\n   defined\
    \ in [RFC3971], if the router is unable to find a path to the\n   requested anchor,\
    \ it SHOULD send an advertisement without any\n   certificate.  In this case,\
    \ the router SHOULD include the TA options\n   that were solicited.\n"

- title: 6.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "6.  Security Considerations\n   The hash functions referenced in this document\
    \ to calculate the SKI\n   have reasonable random properties in order to provide\
    \ reasonably\n   unique identifiers.  Two identical identifiers in the same validation\n\
    \   path will cause the router to stop fetching certificates once the\n   first\
    \ certificate has been fetched.  In the case that the upward\n   certificate was\
    \ configured as a TA by a host, the router will send to\n   this host an incomplete\
    \ list of certificates, causing the SEND\n   validation to fail.\n   For experimental\
    \ values of the Name Type field, the guidance given in\n   [RFC3692] about the\
    \ use of experimental values needs to be followed.\n"
