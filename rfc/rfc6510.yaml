  - "1.  Introduction\n   Signaling in support of Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS)\
    \ and\n   Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) point-to-point Label Switched Paths (LSPs)\n\
    \   is defined in [RFC3209] and [RFC3473]. [RFC4875] defines signaling\n   support\
    \ for point-to-multipoint (P2MP) Traffic Engineering (TE) LSPs.\n   Two LSP Attributes\
    \ objects are defined in [RFC5420].  These objects\n   may be used to provide\
    \ additional information related to how an LSP\n   should be set up when carried\
    \ in a Path message and, when carried in\n   a Resv message, how an LSP has been\
    \ established.  The definition of\n   the objects includes a narrative description\
    \ of related message\n   formats (see Section 9 of [RFC5420]).  This definition\
    \ does not\n   provide the related Routing Backus-Naur Form (BNF) [RFC5511] that\
    \ is\n   typically used to define how messages are to be constructed using\n \
    \  RSVP objects.  The current message format description has led to the\n   open\
    \ question of how the LSP Attributes objects are to be processed\n   in Resv messages\
    \ of P2MP LSPs (which are defined in [RFC4875]).\n   This document provides the\
    \ BNF for Path and Resv messages carrying\n   the LSP Attributes object.  The\
    \ definition clarifies how the objects\n   are to be carried for all LSP types.\
    \  Both Path and Resv message BNF\n   is provided for completeness.\n   This document\
    \ presents the related RSVP message formats as modified\n   by [RFC5420].  This\
    \ document modifies formats defined in [RFC3209],\n   [RFC3473], and [RFC4875].\
    \  See [RFC5511] for the syntax used by RSVP.\n   Unmodified formats are not listed.\
    \  An example of a case where the\n   modified formats are applicable is described\
    \ in [RFC6511].\n"

- title: 3.  Resv Messages
  contents:
  - "3.  Resv Messages\n   This section updates [RFC4875] and [RFC5420].  Section\
    \ 9 of [RFC5420]\n   contains the following text regarding Resv messages:\n  \
    \    The LSP_ATTRIBUTES object MAY be carried in a Resv message.\n      The order\
    \ of objects in RSVP-TE messages is recommended, but\n      implementations must\
    \ be capable of receiving the objects in any\n      meaningful order.\n      ...\n\
    \      On a Resv message, the LSP_ATTRIBUTES object is placed in the flow\n  \
    \    descriptor and is associated with the FILTER_SPEC object that\n      precedes\
    \ it.  It is RECOMMENDED that the LSP_ATTRIBUTES object be\n      placed immediately\
    \ after the LABEL object.\n      LSRs MUST be prepared to receive this object\
    \ in any order in any\n      position within a Resv message, subject to the previous\
    \ note.\n      Only one instance of the LSP_ATTRIBUTES object is meaningful\n\
    \      within the context of a FILTER_SPEC object.  Subsequent instances\n   \
    \   of the object SHOULD be ignored and MUST be forwarded unchanged.\n   This\
    \ means that LSP attributes may be present per sender (LSP) and\n   allows for\
    \ the LSP Attributes object to be modified using make-\n   before-break (see [RFC3209]).\
    \  This definition is sufficient for\n   point-to-point ([RFC3209] and [RFC3473])\
    \ LSPs and the special case\n   where all point-to-multipoint source-to-leaf (S2L)\
    \ sub-LSPs\n   ([RFC4875]) report the same operational status (as used in\n  \
    \ [RFC5420]).  However, this definition does not allow for different\n   egress\
    \ Label Switching Routers (LSRs) to report different operational\n   statuses.\
    \  In order to allow such reporting, this document adds the\n   following definition:\n\
    \      An LSR that wishes to report the operational status of a (point-\n    \
    \  to-multipoint) S2L sub-LSP may include the LSP Attributes object\n      in\
    \ a Resv message or update the object that is already carried in\n      a Resv\
    \ message.  LSP Attributes objects representing S2L sub-LSP\n      status MUST\
    \ follow a S2L_SUB_LSP object.  Only the first instance\n      of the LSP Attributes\
    \ object is meaningful within the context of a\n      S2L_SUB_LSP object.  Subsequent\
    \ instances of the object SHOULD be\n      ignored and MUST be forwarded unchanged.\n\
    \      When an LSP Attributes object is present before the first\n      S2L_SUB_LSP\
    \ object, the LSP Attributes object represents the\n      operational status of\
    \ all S2L sub-LSPs identified in the message.\n      Subsequent instances of the\
    \ object (e.g., in the filter spec or\n      the S2L sub-LSP flow descriptor)\
    \ SHOULD be ignored and MUST be\n      forwarded unchanged.  When a branch node\
    \ is combining Resv state\n      from multiple receivers into a single Resv message\
    \ and an LSP\n      Attributes object is present before the first S2L_SUB_LSP\
    \ object\n      in a received Resv message, the received LSP Attributes object\n\
    \      SHOULD be moved to follow the first received S2L_SUB_LSP object\n     \
    \ and then SHOULD be duplicated for, and placed after, each\n      subsequent\
    \ S2L_SUB_LSP object.\n"
