This document defines a standard SNMP MIB for ADSL lines based on the ADSL Forum standard data model [9].
The ADSL standard describes ATU C and ATU R as two sides of the ADSL line.
This MIB covers both ATU C and ATU R agent's perspectives.
Each instance defined in the MIB represents a single ADSL line.
It should be noted that the ADSL Forum Network Management Working Group provided input towards the content of this document.

The SNMP Network Management Framework
The SNMP Management Framework presently consists of five major components:  An overall architecture, described in RFC 2571 [13].
Mechanisms for describing and naming objects and events for the purpose of management.
The first version of this Structure of Management Information (SMI) is called SMIv1 and described in STD 16, RFC 1155 [14], STD 16, RFC 1212 [15] and RFC 1215 [16].
The second version, called SMIv2, is described in STD 58, RFC 2578 [1], STD 58, RFC 2579 [2] and STD 58, RFC 2580 [17].
Message protocols for transferring management information.
The first version of the SNMP message protocol is called SNMPv1 and described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [7].
A second version of the SNMP message protocol, which is not an Internet standards track protocol, is called SNMPv2c and described in RFC 1901 [18] and RFC 1906 [19].
The third version of the message protocol is called SNMPv3 and described in RFC 1906 [19], RFC 2572 [20] and RFC 2574 [21].
Protocol operations for accessing management information.
The first set of protocol operations and associated PDU formats is described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [7].
A second set of protocol operations and associated PDU formats is described in RFC 1905 [8].
A set of fundamental applications described in RFC 2573 [22] and the view based access control mechanism described in RFC 2575 [23].
This document specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2.
A MIB conforming to the SMIv1 can be produced through the appropriate translations.
The resulting translated MIB must be semantically equivalent, except where objects or events are omitted because no translation is possible (e.g., use of Counter64).
Some machine readable information in SMIv2 will be converted into textual descriptions in SMIv1 during the translation process.
However, this loss of machine readable information is not considered to change the semantics of the MIB.
Object Definitions Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed the Management Information Base or MIB.
Objects in the MIB are defined using the extended subset of Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1) defined in the SMI.
In particular, each object type is named by an OBJECT IDENTIFIER, an administratively assigned name.
The object type together with an object instance serves to uniquely identify a specific instantiation of the object.
For human convenience, we often use a textual string, termed the descriptor, to also refer to the object type.
Relationship of the ADSL LINE MIB with standard MIBs
This section outlines the relationship of ADSL Line MIB with other MIBs described in RFCs and in their various degrees of "standardization".
4.1  Use of the IfTable
The ADSL LINE MIB specifies the detailed attributes of a data interface.
As such, it needs to integrate with IF MIB [5].
The IANA has assigned the following ifType(s) relative to ADSL:
} Interfaces of each of these types are modeled by this document.
Most MIB tables in this document represent information of one of these interface types and are indexed by ifIndex.
Remaining are `profile' tables which may be accessed by the profileIndex.
This is explained in more detail in section 5.4 Profiles.
As shown below, three ADSL interface types are defined in this document, namely physical, interleaved channel, and fast channel.
The physical interface represents characteristics of the physical media associated with both the ATUC and ATUR.
The interleaved and fast channel interface represent the characteristics of the two types of ADSL channels.
For each ADSL Line, a physical interface always exists.
Depending on which ADSL operational configuration is present (as listed in Figure 5), the channel interfaces (fast or interleaved) may or may not exist.
The following attributes are part of the required ifGeneralInformationGroup object group specified in RFC 2233 [5], and are not duplicated in the ADSL MIB.
Keep in mind that these objects apply to the agent's view of the line.
This object should have an octet string with zero length.

Figure 2: Use of ifTable Objects:
ifGeneralInformationGroup Use of the ifStackTable to associate the entries for physical, fast, interleaved channels, and higher layers (e.g., ATM) is shown below in figure 3.
Use of ifStackTable is necessary, because configuration information is stored in profile tables associated with the physical layer ifEntry only.
The channels' ifEntrys need the ifStackTable to find their associated physical layer entry and thus their configuration parameters.
The ifStackTable is then used to show the relationships between the various ADSL interfaces, as illustrated below in figure 4.
Use of ifStackTable (part 2)
The ifRcvAddressTable is not applicable for ADSL interfaces.
4.2  Relationship with RFC 2037
[25] Implementation of the Entity MIB [25] is optional.
It in no way alters the information required in the adslLineMib, nor does it alter the relationship with IF MIB.
The Entity MIB introduces a standardized way of presenting the components of complex systems, such as a Digital Subscriber Line Access Multiplexer (DSLAM), that may contain multiple racks, shelves, line cards, and/or ports.
The Entity MIB's main goal is to present these system components, their containment relationship, and mapping information with other MIBs such as the Interface MIB and the adslLineMib.
If ATU C agent is implemented, the Entity MIB should include entities for the ATU C in the entPhysicalTable.
The MIB's entAliasMappingTable would contain mapping information identifying the 'ifIndex' object associated with each ATU C.
However, if ATU R agent is implemented, the Entity MIB should include entities for the ATU R in the entPhysicalTable.
In this case, the MIB's entAliasMappingTable would  contain mapping information identifying the 'ifIndex' object associated with each ATU R. Also associating the relationship between the ifTable and Entity MIB, the entPhysicalTable contains an 'entPhysicalName' object, which approximates the semantics of the 'ifName' object from the Interface MIB.
Conventions used in the MIB 5.1
Naming Conventions A. Atuc/Atur are used for the ATU C and ATU R.
In other RFCs, these are sometimes referred to as the Near End (Ne) and Far End (Fe) respectively, but not in this document.
The terms, "transmit" and "receive", are from the perspective of the corresponding table's end of the line.
For example, in the case of Fast channels, adslAtucChanConfFastMaxTxRate defines the "downstream" rate, while adslAturChanConfFastMaxTxRate defines the "upstream" rate for a particular channel.
There are two possible channels:
None, one or both may be implemented on a particular ADSL Line.
Figure 5 illustrates all possible operational configurations.
D. Lof, Lol, Los, Lpr mean Loss of Framing, Link, Signal, and Power, respectively.
Lpr is used by T1E1, so it is used for consistency (rather than Lop).
A Loss of Link condition is declared at the ATU C if a Loss of Signal is not preceded by a `dying gasp' message from the ATU R. Note that Loss of Link is only supported by the ATU C. E. ES means errored second.
An Errored Second is any second containing one or more CRC anomaly, or one or more Los(s) or Severely Errored Frame (Sef)
F. A "block" is a physical layer `data buffer' over which CRCs are calculated.
For example, in DMT, the block is defined as the ADSL superframe.
The block duration is 250 micro seconds so the block length in bytes, as defined in adslAtu ChanCrcBlockLength, varies with data rate.
See Line Code Specific MIBs [11]
[12] for more line code specific information.
G. Atn means Attenuation, Psd is Power Spectral Density and Snr is Signal to Noise Ratio.
H. LCS means line code specific, e.g., DMT   Discrete MultiTone CAP   Carrierless Amplitude and Phase modulation and QAM   Quadrature Amplitude Modulation I. Vendor (in the Inventory objects) refers to the manufacturer of the ATU C or ATU R assembly, not the modem chip vendor.
When in doubt, use the manufacturer of the smallest field replaceable unit (e.g., stand alone modem box, plug in board).
J. RADSL Rate Adaptive Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Loop 5.2  Structure
The MIB has multiple parallel tables.
There are tables for: line  common attributes atuc and atur status atuc and atur performance Current and up to 96 buckets of 15 min performance history Current and Previous 1 day bucket performance history profiles configuration parameters and alarm parameters
There are separate tables for Physical and Channel layers.
Since their attributes are similar, only one set of "channel" tables are defined to be used for both fast and interleaved channels.
The corresponding ifType gives the proper interpretation for that ifEntry.
It is intented that Line Code Specific MIBs be located under adslLCSMib.
These MIBs will be defined in separate modules.
There could have been fewer tables by combining the ATU C and ATU R information into shared tables.
However, the tables are more easily read when there are two identical sets of data.
The figure below lists the five possible ADSL operational configurations.
(indicated by the value of the adslLineType).
In all configurations, the physical line interface entry will exist.
However, the existence of the ADSL channel varies in each case, as shown below.
In (4), channel exists of either Fast or Interleaved type, but not both.
The Manager may select the type of channel to be used.
Depending on which operation configuration exists, some or all ADSL MIB tables could be supported, as shown in below.
See Conformance Statements for more information on which objects are mandatory.
Use of ADSL MIB Tables with various ifIndex values NOTE:
The adslLineConfProfileTable and adslLineAlarmConfProfileTable will be present for all scenarios.
See Profile Section of this document for implementation details such as profile creation, assignment, and indexing.
5.2.1 Structure of Conformance Groups
The MIB is organized to cover both ends of the ADSL line, ATU C and ATU R.
Objects defined can be categorized into two groups:  the ATU C group which provides objects that are supported by ATU C agents and the ATU R group which provides objects that are supported by ATU R agents.
These two groups are defined by the conformance section of the MIB.
All objects defined in the MIB module are supported by the ATU C agent and only portions of the objects are supported by the ATU R agent.
Figure 7 lists all tables/objects that are supported by the ATU R agent.
MIB Tables and Objects Supported by the ATU R Agent
All traps supported by the ATU R agent are also listed:
adslAtucPerfLofsThreshTrap adslAtucPerfLossThreshTrap adslAtucPerfESsThreshTrap adslAtucRateChangeTrap adslAturPerfLofsThreshTrap adslAturPerfLossThreshTrap adslAturPerfLprsThreshTrap adslAturPerfESsThreshTrap adslAturRateChangeTrap 5.3  Counters, Interval Buckets and Thresholds For physical level ES, Los, Lof, Lol, Lpr and line initialization attempts, there are event counters, current 15 minute and one (up to 96) 15 minute history bucket(s) of "interval counters", as well as current and previous 1 day interval counters.
Each physical layer current 15 minute event bucket has threshold trap.
At the channel level, there are counters for total received blocks, received and corrected blocks, received but uncorrectable blocks, and transmitted blocks.
There are the same set of 15 minute and 1 day buckets as at the physical layer.
There is no requirement for an agent to ensure fixed relationship between the start of a fifteen minute and any wall clock; however some implementations may align the fifteen minute intervals with quarter hours.
Likewise, an implementation may choose to align one day intervals with start of a day.
Separate tables are provided for the 96 interval counters.
They are indexed by {ifIndex, AdslAtu IntervalNumber}.
Counters are not reset when an ATU C or ATU R is reinitialized, only when the agent is reset or reinitialized (or under specific request outside the scope of this MIB).
The 15 minute event counters are of type PerfCurrentCount and PerfIntervalCount.
The 1 day event counters are of type AdslPerfCurrDayCount and AdslPerfPrevDayCount.
Both 15 minute and 1  day time elapsed counters are of type AdslPerfTimeElapsed.
As a managed node can handle a large number of ATU Cs (e.g., hundreds or perhaps thousands of ADSL lines), provisioning every parameter on every ATU C may become burdensome.
In response, two MIB tables have been created to define ADSL equipment configuration data profiles, as well as a mechanism to associate the equipment to these profiles.
Profile tables may be implemented in one of two ways, but not simultaneously:
Dynamic Profiles one profile shared by one or multiple ADSL lines.
Static Profiles one profile per ADSL physical line always.
Dynamic Profiles Implementations using this mode will enable the manager to dynamically create and delete profiles as needed.
The index of the profile is an locally unique administratively assigned name for the profile having the textual convention `SnmpAdminString'
One or more ADSL lines may be configured to share parameters of a single profile (e.g., adslLineConfProfileName   `silver') by setting its adslLineConfProfile objects to the index value of this profile.
If a change is made to the profile, all lines that refer to it will be re configured to the changed parameters.
Before a profile can be deleted or taken out of service it must be first unreferenced from all associated lines.
This figure below shows an example of how this mode can be implemented.
In the example, ADSL lines `1' and `x' share the configuration of the `silver' profile, while line `2' uses the `platinum' profile.
The `gold' profile has no lines associated with it.
In the figure above, note that three interface entries of an ADSL line, physical, fast channel, and interleaved channel, are represented by `i', `j', and `k'.
Only the physical layer entry `i' contains an adslLineTable entry, therefore only those entries contain pointers to the adslLineConfProfileTable.
The ifStackTable (see rfc2233 [5]) can be used to link the channel entries to the corresponding physical layer entry to get the channel's configuration parameters.
See figure 4 for use of the ifStackTable.
The same characteristics and mechanisms are present for the alarm profile type.
There is no requirement that its index be the same as the configuration profile.
Implementations of this mode, must provide a default profile whose name is `DEFVAL' for each profile type: Configuration and Alarm.
The values of the associated parameters will be vendor specific unless otherwise indicated in this document.
Before a line's profiles have been set, these profiles will be automatically used by setting adslLineConfProfile and adslLineAlarmConfProfile to `DEFVAL'.
In this mode, profiles are created, assigned, and deleted dynamically using these four objects: adslLineConfProfile, adslLineConfProfileRowStatus, adslLineAlarmConfProfile,  and adslLineAlarmConfProfileRowStatus.
Static Profiles Implementations with this mode will automatically create a profile one for one with each ADSL line physical entry.
The name of this profile is a system generated read only object whose value is equivalent to the index of the physical line.
The Agent will not allow a Manager to create/delete profiles in this mode.
Therefore, adslLineConfProfile, adslLineConfProfileRowStatus, adslLineAlarmConfProfile, and adslLineAlarmConfProfileRowStatus objects have minimal value in this mode and are read only.
The figure below shows an example of this mode.
In the example, ADSL lines `1', `2', and `x' each have their own profiles.
Use of Static Profiles: MODE II 5.5
These SNMP traps are required: coldStart / warmStart (per [6])
which are per agent (e.g., per DSLAM in such a device), and linkUp / linkDown (per [5])
which are per interface (i.e., ADSL line).
RFC 2233 [5] recommends that linkUp / linkDown only be used at a physical layer ifEntry, as discussed above.
A linkDown trap is generated whenever any of Lof, Los, Lol, Loss of Signal Quality, or Lpr events occurs.
At this operational point, a manager can use adslAtu CurrStatus for additional detailed information.
The corresponding linkUp trap is sent when all link failure conditions are cleared.
The traps defined in this MIB are for initialization failure, rate change, and for the threshold crossings associated with the following events: Lofs, Lols, Loss, Lprs, and ESs.
Each threshold has its own enable/threshold value.
When that value is 0, the trap is disabled.
The current status objects (adslAtu CurrStatus) indicate, through a bitmask, all outstanding error conditions or that the line is operational.
Note that each object claims to represent the status of the modem at that end of the line.
However, since the SNMP agent likely co resides with only one end of the line, the corresponding far end current status object may be incomplete.
For example, when there are errors on the line, the far end ATU may not be able to correctly report this condition.
Therefore, not all conditions are included in its current status.
A threshold trap occurs whenever the corresponding current 15 minute interval error counter becomes equal and/or exceeds to the threshold value.
One trap will be sent per interval per interface.
Since the current 15 minute counter are reset to 0 every 15 minutes, if the condition persists, the trap may recur as often as every 15 minutes.
For example, to get a trap whenever a "loss of" event occurs (but at most once every 15 minutes), set the corresponding "Thresh15Min" to 1.
The agent will generate a trap when the event originally occurs.
Note that the NMS will get a linkDown trap, as well, if enabled.
At the beginning of the next 15 minute interval, the counter is reset.
When the first second goes by and the event occurs, the current interval bucket will be 1, which equals the threshold and the trap will be sent again.
The rate change trap is invoked when the transmit rate on a channel either increases by adsl(x)Thresh(y)RateUp or decreases by adsl(x)Thresh(y)RateDown.
The trap is per direction:(x)   Atuc or Atur, and per channel:
In other words, the trap is sent whenever the rate changes in either direction on either channel and:
PrevTxRate plus ThreshRateUp or CurrTxRate
No trap is sent on initialization.
It can be disabled by setting the Up (and/or) Down threshold rates to 0.
The PrevTxRate object is set to the current value at initialization and when a trap is sent.
Thus rate changes are cumulative until the total change reaches the threshold.

MIB Working Group (adsl@xlist.agcs.com) " DESCRIPTION "
The MIB module defining objects for the management of a pair of ADSL modems at each end of the ADSL line.
Each such line has an entry in an ifTable which may include multiple modem lines.
An agent may reside at either end of the ADSL line however the MIB is designed to require no management communication between them beyond that inherent in the low level ADSL line protocol.
The agent may monitor and control this protocol for its needs.
ADSL lines may support optional Fast or Interleaved channels.
If these are supported, additional entries corresponding to the supported channels must be created in the ifTable.
Thus an ADSL line that supports both channels will have three entries in the ifTable, one for each physical, fast, and interleaved, whose ifType values are equal to adsl(94), fast(125), and interleaved(124), respectively.
The ifStackTable is used to represent the relationship between the entries.

Blocking unauthorized access to the ADSL MIB via the element management system is outside the scope of this document.
It should be noted that access to the MIB permits the unauthorized entity to modify the profiles (sect 6.4) such that both subscriber service and network operations can be interfered with.
Subscriber service can be altered by modifying any of a number of service characteristics such as rate partitioning and maximum transmission rates.
Network operations can be impacted by modification of trap thresholds such as SNR margins.
There are a number of managed objects in this MIB that may be considered to contain sensitive information.
In particular, the certain objects may be considered sensitive in many environments, since it would allow an intruder to obtain information about which vendor's equipment is in use on the network.
Therefore, it may be important in some environments to control read access to these objects and possibly to even encrypt the values of these object when sending them over the network via SNMP.
Not all versions of SNMP provide features for such a secure environment.
by itself is such an insecure environment.
Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec), even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is allowed to access and GET (read)
the objects in this MIB.
It is recommended that the implementors consider the security features as provided by the SNMPv3 framework.
Specifically, the use of the User based Security Model RFC 2574 [21] and the View based Access Control Model RFC 2575
It is then a customer/user responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an instance of this MIB, is properly configured to give access to those objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate rights to access them.
ADSL layer connectivity from the ATU R will permit the subscriber to manipulate both the ADSL link directly and the AOC/EOC channels for their own loop.
