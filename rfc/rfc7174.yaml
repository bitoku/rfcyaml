  - "1.  Introduction\n   This document specifies a reference framework for Operations,\n\
    \   Administration, and Maintenance (OAM) [RFC6291] in Transparent\n   Interconnection\
    \ of Lots of Links (TRILL) networks.\n   TRILL [RFC6325] specifies a protocol\
    \ for shortest-path frame routing\n   in multi-hop networks with arbitrary topologies\
    \ and link\n   technologies, using the IS-IS routing protocol.  TRILL capable\n\
    \   devices are referred to as TRILL Switches or RBridges (Routing\n   Bridges).\
    \  RBridges provide an optimized and transparent Layer 2\n   delivery service\
    \ for Ethernet unicast and multicast traffic.  Some\n   characteristics of a TRILL\
    \ network that are different from IEEE 802.1\n   bridging are the following:\n\
    \   -  TRILL networks support arbitrary link technology between TRILL\n      Switches.\
    \  Hence, a TRILL Switch port may not have a 48-bit Media\n      Access Control\
    \ (MAC) address [802] but might, for example, have an\n      IP address as an\
    \ identifier [TRILL-IP] or no unique identifier\n      (e.g., PPP [RFC6361]).\n\
    \   -  TRILL networks do not enforce congruence of unicast and multicast\n   \
    \   paths between a given pair of RBridges.\n   -  TRILL networks do not impose\
    \ symmetry of the forward and reverse\n      paths between a given pair of RBridges.\n\
    \   -  TRILL Switches terminate spanning tree protocols instead of\n      propagating\
    \ them.\n   In this document, we refer to the term \"OAM\" as defined in [RFC6291].\n\
    \   The Operations aspect involves finding problems that prevent proper\n   functioning\
    \ of the network.  It also includes monitoring of the\n   network to identify\
    \ potential problems before they occur.\n   Administration involves keeping track\
    \ of network resources.\n   Maintenance activities are focused on facilitating\
    \ repairs and\n   upgrades as well as corrective and preventive measures.\n  \
    \ [ISO/IEC7498-4] defines 5 functional areas in the OSI model for\n   network\
    \ management, commonly referred to as FCAPS:\n   -  Fault Management\n   -  Configuration\
    \ Management\n   -  Accounting Management\n   -  Performance Management\n   -\
    \  Security Management\n   The focus of this document is on the first and fourth\
    \ functional\n   aspects, Fault Management and Performance Management, in TRILL\n\
    \   networks.  These primarily map to the Operations and Maintenance\n   parts\
    \ of OAM.\n   This document provides a generic framework for a comprehensive\n\
    \   solution that meets the requirements outlined in [RFC6905].  However,\n  \
    \ specific mechanisms to address these requirements are considered to\n   be outside\
    \ the scope of this document.  Furthermore, future\n   document(s) will specify\
    \ the optional reporting of errors in TRILL\n   user traffic, such as the use\
    \ of a reserved or unknown egress\n   nickname, etc.\n"

- title: 2.1.  OAM Layering
  contents:
  - "2.1.  OAM Layering\n      In the TRILL architecture, the TRILL layer is independent\
    \ of the\n      underlying link-layer technology.  Therefore, it is possible to\n\
    \      run TRILL over any transport layer capable of carrying TRILL\n      packets\
    \ such as Ethernet [RFC6325], PPP [RFC6361], or IP\n      [TRILL-IP].  Furthermore,\
    \ TRILL provides a virtual Ethernet\n      connectivity service that is transparent\
    \ to higher-layer entities\n      (Layer 3 and above).  This strict layering is\
    \ observed by TRILL\n      OAM.\n      Of particular interest is the layering\
    \ of TRILL OAM with respect\n      to:\n   -  BFD, which is typically used for\
    \ fast failure detection.\n   -  Ethernet CFM [802.1Q] on paths from an external\
    \ device, over a\n      TRILL campus, to another external device, especially since\
    \ TRILL\n      Switches are likely to be deployed where existing 802.1 bridges\n\
    \      can be such external devices.\n   -  Link OAM, on links interior to a TRILL\

- title: 2.1.1.  Relationship to CFM
  contents:
  - "2.1.1.  Relationship to CFM\n   In the context of a TRILL network, CFM can be\
    \ used as either a\n   client-layer OAM or a transport-layer OAM mechanism.\n\
    \   When acting as a client-layer OAM (see Figure 1a), CFM provides fault\n  \
    \ management capabilities for the user, on an end-to-end basis over the\n   TRILL\
    \ network.  Edge ports of the TRILL network may be visible to CFM\n   operations\
    \ through the optional presence of a CFM Maintenance\n   Intermediate Point (MIP)\
    \ in the TRILL Switches' edge Ethernet ports.\n   When acting as a transport-layer\
    \ OAM (see Figure 1c), CFM provides\n   fault management functions for the IEEE\
    \ 802.1Q bridged LANs that may\n   interconnect RBridges.  Such bridged LANs can\
    \ be used as TRILL level\n   links between RBridges.  RBridges directly connected\
    \ to the\n   intervening 802.1Q bridges may host CFM Down Maintenance End Points\n\
    \   (MEPs).\n"
- title: 2.1.2.  Relationship to BFD
  contents:
  - "2.1.2.  Relationship to BFD\n   One-hop BFD (see Figure 1d) runs between adjacent\
    \ RBridges and\n   provides fast link as well as node failure detection capability\n\
    \   [RFC7175].  Note that TRILL BFD also provides some testing of the\n   TRILL\
    \ protocol stack and thus sits a layer above Link OAM, which is\n   media specific.\
    \  BFD's fast failure detection helps support rapid\n   convergence in TRILL networks.\
    \  The requirements for BFD are\n   different from those of the TRILL OAM mechanisms\
    \ that are the prime\n   focus of this document.  Furthermore, BFD does not use\
    \ the frame\n   format described in Section 3.1.\n   TRILL BFD differs from TRILL\
    \ OAM in two significant ways:\n   1.  A TRILL BFD transmitter is always bound\
    \ to a specific TRILL\n       output port.\n   2.  TRILL BFD messages can be transmitted\
    \ by the originator out of a\n       port to a neighbor RBridge when the adjacency\
    \ is in the Detect or\n       2-Way states as well as when the adjacency is in\
    \ the Report (Up)\n       state [RFC7177].\n   In contrast, TRILL OAM messages\
    \ are typically transmitted by\n   appearing to have been received on a TRILL\
    \ input port (refer to\n   Section 2.2 for details).  In that case, the output\
    \ ports on which\n   TRILL OAM messages are sent are determined by the TRILL routing\n\
    \   function.  The TRILL routing function will only send on links that\n   are\
    \ in the Report state and have been incorporated into the local\n   view of the\
    \ campus topology.\n"
- title: 2.1.3.  Relationship to Link OAM
  contents:
  - "2.1.3.  Relationship to Link OAM\n   Link OAM (see Figure 1e) depends on the\
    \ nature of the technology used\n   in the links interconnecting RBridges.  For\
    \ example, for Ethernet\n   links, the OAM described in Clause 57 of [802.3] may\
    \ be used.\n"

  - "2.2.  TRILL OAM in the RBridge Port Model\n   TRILL OAM processing can be represented\

    \ TRILL OAM requires\n   services of the RBridge forwarding engine and utilizes\

- title: 2.4.  Maintenance Domains
  contents:
  - "2.4.  Maintenance Domains\n   The concept of Maintenance Domains, or OAM Domains,\
    \ is well known in\n   the industry.  IEEE [802.1Q] defines the notion of a Maintenance\n\
    \   Domain as a collection of devices (for example, network elements)\n   that\
    \ are grouped for administrative and/or management purposes.\n   Maintenance Domains\
    \ usually delineate trust relationships, varying\n   addressing schemes, network\
    \ infrastructure capabilities, etc.\n   When mapped to TRILL, a Maintenance Domain\
    \ is defined as a collection\n   of RBridges in a network for which connectivity\
    \ faults and\n   performance degradation are to be managed by a single operator.\
    \  All\n   RBridges in a given Maintenance Domain are, by definition, managed\
    \ by\n   a single entity (for example, an enterprise or a data center\n   operator,\
    \ etc.).  [RFC6325] defines the operation of TRILL in a\n   single IS-IS area,\
    \ with the assumption that a single operator manages\n   the network.  In this\
    \ context, a single (default) Maintenance Domain\n   is sufficient for TRILL OAM.\n\
    \   However, when considering scenarios where different TRILL networks\n   need\
    \ to be interconnected, for example, as discussed in [TRILL-ML],\n   then the\
    \ introduction of multiple Maintenance Domains, and\n   Maintenance Domain hierarchies,\
    \ becomes useful to map and enforce\n   administrative boundaries.  When considering\
    \ multi-domain scenarios,\n   the following rules must be followed: TRILL OAM\
    \ Domains must not\n   partially intersect but must either be disjoint or nest\
    \ to form a\n   hierarchy (that is, a higher Maintenance Domain may completely\n\
    \   enclose a lower domain).  A Maintenance Domain is typically\n   identified\
    \ by a Domain Name and a Maintenance Level (a numeric\n   identifier).  If two\
    \ domains are nested, the encompassing domain must\n   be assigned a higher Maintenance\
    \ Level number than the enclosed\n   domain.  For this reason, the encompassing\
    \ domain is commonly\n   referred to as the 'higher' domain, and the enclosed\
    \ domain is\n   referred to as the 'lower' domain.  OAM functions in the lower\
    \ domain\n   are completely transparent to the higher domain.  Furthermore, OAM\n\
    \   functions in the higher domain only have visibility to the boundary\n   of\
    \ the lower domain (for example, an attempt to trace the path in the\n   higher\
    \ domain will depict the entire lower domain as a single-hop\n   between the RBridges\
    \ that constitute the boundary of that lower\n   domain).  By the same token,\
    \ OAM functions in the higher domain are\n   transparent to RBridges that are\
    \ internal to the lower domain.  The\n   hierarchical nesting of domains is established\
    \ through operator\n   configuration of the RBridges.\n     +-------------------+\

- title: 4.1.1.  Fault Detection (Continuity Check)
  contents:
  - "4.1.1.  Fault Detection (Continuity Check)\n   Proactive fault detection is performed\
    \ by periodically monitoring the\n   reachability between service endpoints, that\
    \ is, MEPs in a given MA,\n   through the exchange of Continuity Check messages.\
    \  The reachability\n   between any two arbitrary MEPs may be monitored for a\
    \ specified path,\n   all paths, or any representative path.  The fact that TRILL\
    \ networks\n   do not enforce congruence between unicast and multicast paths means\n\
    \   that the proactive fault detection mechanism must provide procedures\n   to\
    \ monitor the unicast paths independently of the multicast paths.\n   Furthermore,\
    \ where the network has ECMP, the proactive fault\n   detection mechanism must\
    \ be capable of exercising the equal-cost\n   paths individually.\n   The set\
    \ of MEPs exchanging Continuity Check messages in a given\n   domain and for a\
    \ specific monitored entity (flow, network, or\n   service) must use the same\
    \ transmission period.  As long as the fault\n   detection mechanism involves\
    \ MEPs transmitting periodic heartbeat\n   messages independently, then this OAM\
    \ procedure is not affected by\n   the lack of forward/reverse path symmetry in\
    \ TRILL.\n   The proactive fault detection function must detect the following\n\
    \   types of defects:\n   -  Loss of continuity to one or more remote MEPs\n \
    \  -  Unexpected connectivity between isolated VLANs or fine-grained\n      labels\
    \ (mismerge)\n   -  Unexpected connectivity to one or more remote MEPs\n   - \
    \ Mismatch of the Continuity Check transmission period between MEPs\n"

    \   categorized into two types; these types are discussed in the\n   following\
    \ subsections.\n"
- title: 4.1.2.1.  Forward Defect Indication
  contents:
  - "4.1.2.1.  Forward Defect Indication\n   Forward defect indication is used to\
    \ signal a failure that is\n   detected by a lower-layer OAM mechanism.  A forward\
    \ defect indication\n   is transmitted away from the direction of the failure.\
    \  For example,\n   consider a simple network comprised of four RBridges connected\
    \ in\n   series: RB1, RB2, RB3, and RB4.  Both RB1 and RB4 are hosting TRILL\n\
    \   OAM MEPs, whereas RB2 and RB3 have MIPs.  If the link between RB2 and\n  \
    \ RB3 fails, then RB2 can send a forward defect indication towards RB1\n   while\
    \ RB3 sends a forward defect indication towards RB4.\n   Forward defect indication\
    \ may be used for alarm suppression and/or\n   for the purpose of interworking\
    \ with other layer OAM protocols.\n   Alarm suppression is useful when a transport/network-level\
    \ fault\n   translates to multiple service- or flow-level faults.  In such a\n\
    \   scenario, it is enough to alert a network management station (NMS) of\n  \
    \ the single transport/network-level fault in lieu of flooding that NMS\n   with\
    \ a multitude of Service or Flow granularity alarms.\n"
- title: 4.1.2.2.  Reverse Defect Indication (RDI)
  contents:
  - "4.1.2.2.  Reverse Defect Indication (RDI)\n   RDI is used to signal that the\
    \ advertising MEP has detected a loss-\n   of-continuity defect.  RDI is transmitted\
    \ in the direction of the\n   failure.  For example, consider the same series\
    \ network as that in\n   Section 4.1.2.1.  If RB1 detects that is has lost connectivity\
    \ to RB4\n   because it is no longer receiving Continuity Check messages from\
    \ the\n   MEP on RB4, then RB1 can transmit an RDI towards RB4 to inform the\n\
    \   latter of the failure.  If the failure is unidirectional (it is\n   affecting\
    \ the direction from RB4 to RB1), then the RDI enables RB4 to\n   become aware\
    \ of the unidirectional connectivity anomaly.\n   In the presence of equal-cost\
    \ paths between MEPs, RDI must be able to\n   identify on which equal-cost path\
    \ the failure was detected.\n   RDI allows single-sided management, where the\
    \ network operator can\n   examine the state of a single MEP and deduce the overall\
    \ health of a\n   monitored entity (network, flow, or service).\n"

    \ for\n   reachability.  This function should include mechanisms to prevent\n\
    \   reply storms from overwhelming the initiating RBridge.  This may be\n   done,\
    \ for example, by staggering the replies through the introduction\n   of a random\
    \ delay timer, with a preset upper bound, on the responding\n   RBridge (CFM [802.1Q]\
    \ uses similar mechanisms for Linktrace Reply\n   messages to mitigate the load\

- title: 4.2.2.  Fault Isolation
  contents:
  - "4.2.2.  Fault Isolation\n   TRILL OAM must support an on-demand connectivity\
    \ fault localization\n   function.  This is the capability to trace the path of\
    \ a flow on a\n   hop-by-hop (RBridge-by-RBridge) basis to isolate failures. \
    \ This\n   involves the capability to narrow down the locality of a fault to a\n\
    \   particular port, link, or node.  The characteristic of\n   forward/reverse\
    \ path asymmetry, in TRILL, renders Fault Isolation\n   into a direction-sensitive\
    \ operation.  That is, given two RBridges, A\n   and B, localization of connectivity\
    \ faults between them requires\n   running Fault Isolation procedures from RBridge\
    \ A to RBridge B as\n   well as from RBridge B to RBridge A.  Generally speaking,\
    \ single-\n   sided Fault Isolation is not possible in TRILL OAM.\n   Furthermore,\
    \ TRILL OAM should support Fault Isolation over\n   distribution trees for both\
    \ un-pruned as well as pruned trees.  The\n   former allows the tracing of all\

- title: 5.1.  Packet Loss
  contents:
  - "5.1.  Packet Loss\n   Given that TRILL provides inherent support for multipoint-to-\n\
    \   multipoint connectivity, then packet loss cannot be accurately\n   measured\
    \ by means of counting user data packets.  This is because\n   user packets can\
    \ be delivered to more RBridges or more ports than are\n   necessary (for example,\
    \ due to broadcast, un-pruned multicast, or\n   unknown unicast flooding).  As\
    \ such, a statistical means of\n   approximating packet loss rate is required.\
    \  This can be achieved by\n   sending \"synthetic\" (TRILL OAM) packets that\
    \ are counted only by\n   those ports (MEPs) that are required to receive them.\
    \  This provides\n   a statistical approximation of the number of data frames\
    \ lost, even\n   with multipoint-to-multipoint connectivity.  TRILL OAM mechanisms\
    \ for\n   synthetic packet loss measurement should follow the statistical\n  \
    \ considerations specified in [MEF35], especially with regard to the\n   volume/frequency\
    \ of synthetic traffic generation and associated\n   impact on packet loss count\
    \ accuracy.\n   Packet loss probes must be initiated from a MEP and must target\
    \ a\n   MEP.  This function should be supported on sections, as defined in\n \
    \  [RFC6905].  When packet loss is measured over a section, and the\n   initiating\
    \ MEP does not coincide with the edge (ingress) RBridge, the\n   MEP must use\
    \ the edge RBridge nickname instead of the local RBridge\n   nickname on the associated\
    \ loss measurement messages.  The user must\n   supply the edge RBridge nickname\
    \ as part of the operation parameters.\n   TRILL OAM mechanisms should support\
    \ one-way and two-way Packet Loss\n   Monitoring.  In one-way monitoring, a source\
    \ RBridge triggers Packet\n   Loss Monitoring messages to a target RBridge, and\
    \ the latter is\n   responsible for calculating the loss in the direction from\
    \ the source\n   RBridge towards the target RBridge.  In two-way monitoring, a\
    \ source\n   RBridge triggers Packet Loss Monitoring messages to a target RBridge,\n\
    \   and the latter replies to the source with response messages.  The\n   source\
    \ RBridge can then monitor packet loss in both directions\n   (source to target\

    \ the latter is\n   responsible for calculating the delay in the direction from\
    \ the\n   source RBridge towards the target RBridge.  This requires\n   synchronization\
    \ of the clocks between the two RBridges.  In two-way\n   monitoring, a source\

  contents:
  - "6.2.  TRILL OAM Notifications\n   TRILL OAM mechanisms should trigger notifications\
    \ to alert operators\n   to certain conditions.  Such conditions include but are\
    \ not limited\n   to:\n   -  Faults detected by proactive mechanisms.\n   -  Reception\
    \ of event-driven defect indications.\n   -  Logged security incidents pertaining\
    \ to the OAM Message Channel.\n   -  Protocol errors (for example, as caused by\
    \ misconfiguration).\n   Notifications generated by TRILL OAM mechanisms may be\
    \ via SNMP,\n   Syslog messages [RFC5424], or any other standard management protocol\n\
    \   that supports asynchronous notifications.\n"
- title: 6.3.  Collecting Performance Monitoring Metrics
  contents:
  - "6.3.  Collecting Performance Monitoring Metrics\n   When performing the optional\
    \ TRILL OAM performance monitoring\n   functions, two RBridge designations are\
    \ involved: a source RBridge\n   and a target RBridge.  The source RBridge is\
    \ the one from which the\n   performance monitoring probe is initiated, and the\
    \ target RBridge is\n   the destination of the probe.  The goal is to monitor\
    \ performance\n   characteristics between the two RBridges.  The RBridge from\
    \ which the\n   network operator can extract the results of the probe (the\n \
    \  performance monitoring metrics) depends on whether one-way or two-way\n   performance\
    \ monitoring functions are performed:\n   -  In the case of one-way performance\
    \ monitoring functions, the\n      metrics will be available at the target RBridge.\n\
    \   -  In the case of two-way performance monitoring functions, all the\n    \
    \  metrics will be available at the source RBridge, and a subset will\n      be\
    \ available at the target RBridge.  More specifically, metrics in\n      the direction\
    \ from source to target as well as the direction from\n      target to source\
    \ will be available at the source RBridge.  Metrics\n      in the direction from\
    \ source to target will be available at the\n      target RBridge.\n"
- title: 7.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "7.  Security Considerations\n   TRILL OAM must provide mechanisms for:\n   -\
    \  Preventing denial-of-service attacks caused by exploitation of the\n      OAM\
    \ Message Channel, where a rogue device may overload the\n      RBridges and the\
    \ network with OAM messages.  This could lead to\n      interruption of the OAM\
    \ services and, in the extreme case, disrupt\n      network connectivity.  Mechanisms\
    \ such as control-plane policing\n      combined with shaping or rate limiting\
    \ of OAM messaging can be\n      employed to mitigate this.\n   -  Optionally\
    \ authenticating at communicating endpoints (MEPs and\n      MIPs) that an OAM\
    \ message has originated at an appropriate\n      communicating endpoint.\n  \
    \ -  Preventing TRILL OAM packets from leaking outside of the TRILL\n      network\
    \ or outside their corresponding Maintenance Domain.  This\n      can be done\
    \ by having MEPs implement a filtering function based on\n      the Maintenance\
    \ Level associated with received OAM packets.\n   For general TRILL Security Considerations,\
    \ see [RFC6325].\n"
