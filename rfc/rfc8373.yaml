  - "Abstract\n   Users have various human (i.e., natural) language needs, abilities,\n\
    \   and preferences regarding spoken, written, and signed languages.\n   This\
    \ document defines new Session Description Protocol (SDP) media-\n   level attributes\
    \ so that when establishing interactive communication\n   sessions (\"calls\"\
    ), it is possible to negotiate (i.e., communicate\n   and match) the caller's\
    \ language and media needs with the\n   capabilities of the called party.  This\
    \ is especially important for\n   emergency calls, because it allows for a call\
    \ to be handled by a call\n   taker capable of communicating with the user or\
    \ for a translator or\n   relay operator to be bridged into the call during setup.\
    \  However,\n   this also applies to non-emergency calls (for example, calls to\
    \ a\n   company call center).\n   This document describes the need as well as\
    \ a solution that uses new\n   SDP media attributes.\n"

  - "1.  Introduction\n   A mutually comprehensible language is helpful for human\n\
    \   communication.  This document addresses the negotiation of human\n   language\
    \ and media modality (spoken, signed, or written) in real-time\n   communications.\
    \  A companion document [RFC8255] addresses language\n   selection in email.\n\
    \   Unless the caller and callee know each other or there is contextual\n   or\
    \ out-of-band information from which the language(s) and media\n   modalities\
    \ can be determined, there is a need for spoken, signed, or\n   written languages\
    \ to be negotiated based on the caller's needs and\n   the callee's capabilities.\
    \  This need applies to both emergency and\n   non-emergency calls.  An example\
    \ of a non-emergency call is when a\n   caller contacts a company call center;\
    \ an emergency call typically\n   involves a caller contacting a Public Safety\
    \ Answering Point (PSAP).\n   In such scenarios, it is helpful for the caller\
    \ to be able to\n   indicate preferred signed, written, and/or spoken languages\
    \ and for\n   the callee to be able to indicate its capabilities; this allows\
    \ the\n   call to proceed using the language(s) and media forms supported by\n\
    \   both.\n   For various reasons, including the ability to establish multiple\n\
    \   streams using different media (i.e., voice, text, and/or video), it\n   makes\
    \ sense to use a per-stream negotiation mechanism known as the\n   Session Description\
    \ Protocol (SDP).  Utilizing SDP [RFC4566] enables\n   the solution described\
    \ in this document to be applied to all\n   interactive communications negotiated\
    \ using SDP, in emergency as well\n   as non-emergency scenarios.\n   By treating\
    \ language as another SDP attribute that is negotiated\n   along with other aspects\
    \ of a media stream, it becomes possible to\n   accommodate a range of users'\
    \ needs and called-party facilities.  For\n   example, some users may be able\
    \ to speak several languages but have a\n   preference.  Some called parties may\
    \ support some of those languages\n   internally but require the use of a translation\
    \ service for others,\n   or they may have a limited number of call takers able\
    \ to use certain\n   languages.  Another example would be a user who is able to\
    \ speak but\n   is deaf or hard of hearing and desires a voice stream to send\
    \ spoken\n   language plus a text stream to receive written language.  Making\n\
    \   language a media attribute allows standard session negotiation to\n   handle\
    \ this by providing the information and mechanism for the\n   endpoints to make\
    \ appropriate decisions.\n   The term \"negotiation\" is used here rather than\
    \ \"indication\" because\n   human language (spoken/written/signed) can be negotiated\
    \ in the same\n   manner as media (audio/text/video) and codecs.  For example,\
    \ if we\n   think of a user calling an airline reservation center, the user may\n\
    \   be able to use a set of languages, perhaps with preferences for one\n   or\
    \ a few, while the airline reservation center may support a fixed\n   set of languages.\
    \  Negotiation should select the user's most\n   preferred language that is supported\
    \ by the call center.  Both sides\n   should be aware of which language was negotiated.\n\
    \   In the offer/answer model used here, the offer contains a set of\n   languages\
    \ per media (and direction) that the offerer is capable of\n   using, and the\
    \ answer contains one language per media (and direction)\n   that the answerer\
    \ will support.  Supporting languages and/or\n   modalities can require taking\
    \ extra steps, such as bridging external\n   translation or relay resources into\
    \ the call or having a call handled\n   by an agent who speaks a requested language\
    \ and/or has the ability to\n   use a requested modality.  The answer indicates\
    \ the media and\n   languages that the answerer is committing to support (possibly\
    \ after\n   additional steps have been taken).  This model also provides\n   knowledge\
    \ so both ends know what has been negotiated.  Note that\n   additional steps\
    \ required to support the indicated languages or\n   modalities may or may not\
    \ be in place in time for any early media.\n   Since this is a protocol mechanism,\
    \ the user equipment (UE) client\n   needs to know the user's preferred languages;\
    \ while this document\n   does not address how clients determine this, reasonable\
    \ techniques\n   could include a configuration mechanism with a default of the\n\
    \   language of the user interface.  In some cases, a UE client could tie\n  \
    \ language and media preferences, such as a preference for a video\n   stream\
    \ using a signed language and/or a text or audio stream using a\n   written/spoken\
    \ language.\n   This document does not address user interface (UI) issues, such\
    \ as if\n   or how a UE client informs a user about the result of language and\n\
    \   media negotiation.\n"
- title: 1.1.  Applicability
  contents:
  - "1.1.  Applicability\n   Within this document, it is assumed that the negotiating\
    \ endpoints\n   have already been determined so that a per-stream negotiation\
    \ based\n   on SDP can proceed.\n   When setting up interactive communication\
    \ sessions, it is necessary\n   to route signaling messages to the appropriate\
    \ endpoint(s).  This\n   document does not address the problem of language-based\
    \ routing.\n"
- title: 2.  Terminology
  contents:
  - "2.  Terminology\n   The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\"\
    , \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"NOT RECOMMENDED\"\
    , \"MAY\", and\n   \"OPTIONAL\" in this document are to be interpreted as described\
    \ in\n   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all\n\
    \   capitals, as shown here.\n"
- title: 3.  Desired Semantics
  contents:
  - "3.  Desired Semantics\n   The desired solution is a media attribute (preferably\
    \ per direction)\n   that may be used within an offer to indicate the preferred\n\
    \   language(s) of each (direction of a) media stream and within an\n   answer\
    \ to indicate the accepted language.  When multiple languages\n   are included\
    \ for a media stream within an offer, the languages are\n   listed in order of\
    \ preference (most preferred first).\n   Note that negotiating multiple simultaneous\
    \ languages within a media\n   stream is out of scope of this document.\n"
- title: 4.  The Existing 'lang' Attribute
  contents:
  - "4.  The Existing 'lang' Attribute\n   RFC 4566 [RFC4566] specifies an attribute\
    \ 'lang' that is similar to\n   what is needed here but is not sufficiently specific\
    \ or flexible for\n   the needs of this document.  In addition, 'lang' is not\
    \ mentioned in\n   [RFC3264], and there are no known implementations in SIP. \
    \ Further,\n   it is useful to be able to specify language per direction (sending\n\
    \   and receiving).  This document therefore defines two new attributes.\n"
- title: 5.  Solution
  contents:
  - "5.  Solution\n   An SDP attribute (per direction) seems the natural choice to\n\
    \   negotiate human language of an interactive media stream, using the\n   language\
    \ tags of [BCP47].\n"
- title: 5.1.  The 'hlang-send' and 'hlang-recv' Attributes
  contents:
  - "5.1.  The 'hlang-send' and 'hlang-recv' Attributes\n   This document defines\
    \ two media-level attributes: 'hlang-send' and\n   'hlang-recv' (registered in\
    \ Section 6).  Both start with 'hlang',\n   short for \"human language\".  These\
    \ attributes are used to negotiate\n   which human language is selected for use\
    \ in (each direction of) each\n   interactive media stream.  (Note that not all\
    \ streams will\n   necessarily be used.)  Each can appear for media streams in\
    \ offers\n   and answers.\n   In an offer, the 'hlang-send' value is a list of\
    \ one or more\n   language(s) the offerer is willing to use when sending using\
    \ the\n   media, and the 'hlang-recv' value is a list of one or more\n   language(s)\
    \ the offerer is willing to use when receiving using the\n   media.  The list\
    \ of languages is in preference order (first is most\n   preferred).  When a media\
    \ is intended for interactive communication\n   in only one direction (e.g., a\
    \ user in France with difficulty\n   speaking but able to hear who indicates a\
    \ desire to receive French\n   using audio and send French using text), either\
    \ 'hlang-send' or\n   'hlang-recv' MAY be omitted.  Note that the media can still\
    \ be useful\n   in both directions.  When a media is not primarily intended for\n\
    \   language (for example, a video or audio stream intended for\n   background\
    \ only), both SHOULD be omitted.  Otherwise, both SHOULD\n   have the same value.\
    \  Note that specifying different languages for\n   each direction (as opposed\
    \ to the same, or essentially the same,\n   language in different modalities)\
    \ can make it difficult to complete\n   the call (e.g., specifying a desire to\
    \ send audio in Hungarian and\n   receive audio in Portuguese).\n   In an answer,\
    \ 'hlang-send' is the language the answerer will send if\n   using the media for\
    \ language (which in most cases is one of the\n   languages in the offer's 'hlang-recv'),\
    \ and 'hlang-recv' is the\n   language the answerer expects to receive if using\
    \ the media for\n   language (which in most cases is one of the languages in the\
    \ offer's\n   'hlang-send').\n   In an offer, each value MUST be a list of one\
    \ or more language tags\n   per [BCP47], separated by white space.  In an answer,\
    \ each value MUST\n   be one language tag per [BCP47].  [BCP47] describes mechanisms\
    \ for\n   matching language tags.  Note that Section 4.1 of RFC 5646 [BCP47]\n\
    \   advises to \"tag content wisely\" and not include unnecessary subtags.\n \
    \  When placing an emergency call, and in any other case where the\n   language\
    \ cannot be inferred from context, each OFFERed media stream\n   primarily intended\
    \ for human language communication SHOULD specify\n   the 'hlang-send' and/or\
    \ 'hlang-recv' attributes for the direction(s)\n   intended for interactive communication.\n\
    \   Clients acting on behalf of end users are expected to set one or both\n  \
    \ of the 'hlang-send' and 'hlang-recv' attributes on each OFFERed media\n   stream\
    \ primarily intended for human communication when placing an\n   outgoing session,\
    \ and either ignore or take into consideration the\n   attributes when receiving\
    \ incoming calls, based on local\n   configuration and capabilities.  Systems\
    \ acting on behalf of call\n   centers and PSAPs are expected to take the attributes\
    \ into account\n   when processing inbound calls.\n   Note that media and language\
    \ negotiation might result in more media\n   streams being accepted than are needed\
    \ by the users (e.g., if more\n   preferred and less preferred combinations of\
    \ media and language are\n   all accepted).  This is not a problem.\n"
- title: 5.2.  No Language in Common
  contents:
  - "5.2.  No Language in Common\n   A consideration regarding the ability to negotiate\
    \ language is\n   whether the call proceeds or fails if the callee does not support\
    \ any\n   of the languages requested by the caller.  This document does not\n\
    \   mandate either behavior.\n   When a call is rejected due to lack of any language\
    \ in common, the\n   SIP response has SIP response code 488 (Not Acceptable Here)\
    \ or 606\n   (Not Acceptable) [RFC3261] and a Warning header field [RFC3261] with\n\
    \   a warning code of 308 and warning text indicating that there are no\n   mutually\
    \ supported languages; the warning text SHOULD also contain\n   the supported\
    \ languages and media.\n   Example:\n   Warning:  308 proxy.example.com  \"Incompatible\
    \ language\n      specification: Requested languages not supported.  Supported\n\
    \      languages are: es, en; supported media are: audio, text.\"\n"
- title: 5.3.  Usage Notes
  contents:
  - "5.3.  Usage Notes\n   A sign-language tag with a video media stream is interpreted\
    \ as an\n   indication for sign language in the video stream.  A non-sign-\n \
    \  language tag with a text media stream is interpreted as an indication\n   for\
    \ written language in the text stream.  A non-sign-language tag\n   with an audio\
    \ media stream is interpreted as an indication for spoken\n   language in the\
    \ audio stream.\n   This document does not define any other use for language tags\
    \ in\n   video media (such as how to indicate visible captions in the video\n\
    \   stream).\n   This document does not define the use of sign-language tags in\
    \ text\n   or audio media.\n   In the IANA registry for language subtags per [BCP47],\
    \ a language\n   subtag with a Type field \"extlang\" combined with a Prefix field\
    \ value\n   \"sgn\" indicates a sign-language tag.  The absence of such \"sgn\"\
    \n   prefix indicates a non-sign-language tag.\n   This document does not define\
    \ the use of language tags in media other\n   than interactive streams of audio,\

    \ be supported by future work or by\n   application agreement.\n"

    \ here.  An attacker with\n   the ability to modify signaling could prevent a\
    \ call from succeeding\n   by altering any of several crucial elements, including\
    \ the\n   'hlang-send' or 'hlang-recv' values.  RFC 5069 [RFC5069] discusses\n\
    \   such threats.  Use of TLS or IPsec can protect against such threats.\n   Emergency\
    \ calls are of particular concern; RFC 6881 [RFC6881], which\n   is specific to\
    \ emergency calls, mandates use of TLS or IPsec (in\n   ED-57/SP-30).\n"
