  - "Abstract\n   The Diffie-Hellman (DH) Group Exchange for the Secure Shell (SSH)\n\
    \   transport-layer protocol specifies that servers and clients should\n   support\
    \ groups with a minimum modulus group size of 1024 bits.\n   Recent security research\
    \ has shown that the minimum value of 1024\n   bits is insufficient to protect\
    \ against state-sponsored actors and\n   any organization with enough computing\
    \ resources.  This RFC updates\n   RFC 4419, which allowed for DH moduli less\
    \ than 2048 bits; now, 2048\n   bits is the minimum acceptable group size.\n"

- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   [RFC4419] specifies a recommended minimum DH modulus group\
    \ size of\n   1024 bits.  It also suggests that in all cases, the size of the\
    \ group\n   needs to be at least 1024 bits.  This document updates [RFC4419] so\n\
    \   that the minimum recommended size is 2048 bits.  This recommendation\n   is\
    \ based on recent research [LOGJAM] on DH group weaknesses.  This\n   minimum\
    \ DH group size may need to be increased to 3072 for forward-\n   looking users.\n"

    , \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"\
    NOT RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and\n   \"OPTIONAL\" in this document are to be interpreted\
    \ as described in\n   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear\
    \ in all\n   capitals, as shown here.\n"
- title: 3.  2048-Bit DH Group
  contents:
  - "3.  2048-Bit DH Group\n   Recent research [LOGJAM] strongly suggests that DH\
    \ groups that are\n   1024 bits can be broken by state-sponsored actors and any\n\
    \   organization with enough computing resources.  The authors show how\n   they\
    \ are able to break 768-bit DH groups and extrapolate the attack\n   to 1024-bit\
    \ DH groups.  In their analysis, they show that breaking\n   1024 bits can be\
    \ done with sufficient computing resources.  This\n   document provides the following\
    \ recommendation: SSH servers and SSH\n   clients SHOULD support groups with a\
    \ minimum acceptable group size of\n   2048 bits for the \"min\" value of the\
    \ SSH_MSG_KEY_DH_GEX_REQUEST\n   client message given in [RFC4419].  Further,\
    \ SSH clients SHOULD be\n   able to send a value of 3072 bits for the preferred\
    \ acceptable group\n   size \"n\" in the SSH_MSG_KEY_DH_GEX_REQUEST message.\n\
    \   [RFC4419] specifies a recommended minimum size of 1024 bits for k,\n   which\
    \ is the modulus length of the DH group.  It also suggests that,\n   in all cases,\
    \ the size of the group needs be at least 1024 bits.\n   This document updates\
    \ [RFC4419] as described below:\n   o  Section 3, paragraph 9:\n      Servers\
    \ and clients SHOULD support groups with a modulus length of\n      k bits where\
    \ 2048 <= k <= 8192.  The recommended minimum values\n      for min and max are\
    \ 2048 and 8192, respectively.  Setting k to\n      3072 SHOULD be possible, as\
    \ the need may arise in the coming\n      years.\n   o  Section 3, paragraph 11:\n\
    \      In all cases, the size of the group SHOULD be at least 2048 bits.\n   \
    \   Setting the group size to 3072 SHOULD be possible, as the need may\n     \
    \ arise in the coming years.\n"
- title: 4.  Interoperability
  contents:
  - "4.  Interoperability\n   This document keeps the following requirement from [RFC4419]:\n\
    \      The server should return the smallest group it knows that is\n      larger\
    \ than the size the client requested.  If the server does not\n      know a group\
    \ that is larger than the client request, then it\n      SHOULD return the largest\
    \ group it knows.\n   Also, it updates the subsequent sentence as follows:\n \
    \     In all cases, the size of the returned group SHOULD be at least\n      2048\
    \ bits.  Setting the group size to 3072 SHOULD be possible, as\n      the need\
    \ may arise in the coming years.\n"
- title: 5.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "5.  Security Considerations\n   This document discusses security issues of DH\
    \ groups that are 1024\n   bits in size, and formally updates the minimum size\
    \ of DH groups to\n   be 2048 bits.  A hostile or \"owned\" SSH server implementation\
    \ could\n   potentially use backdoored DH primes using the methods described in\n\
    \   [Backdoor-DH] to provide the g and p values to be used.  Or, it could\n  \
    \ just send the calculated secret through a covert channel of some sort\n   to\
    \ a passive listener.\n   A malicious client could cause a Denial of Service by\
    \ intentionally\n   making multiple connections that are less than 2048 bits in\
    \ size.\n   Therefore, operating systems SHOULD NOT log DH groups that are less\n\
    \   than 2048 bits in size, as it would create an additional attack\n   surface.\n"
