Abstract This memo defines algorithm names and parameters for use in some of the SHA 2 family of secure hash algorithms for data integrity verification in the Secure Shell (SSH) protocol.
It also updates RFC 4253 by specifying a new RECOMMENDED data integrity algorithm.
Overview and Rationale The Secure Shell (SSH)
[RFC4251] is a very common protocol for secure remote login on the Internet.
Currently, SSH defines data integrity verification using SHA 1 and MD5 algorithms [RFC4253].
Due to recent security concerns with these two algorithms ([RFC6194] and [RFC6151], respectively), implementors and users request support for data integrity verification using some of the SHA 2 family of secure hash algorithms.
The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].
This memo adopts the style and conventions of [RFC4253] in specifying how the use of new data integrity algorithms are indicated in SSH.
The following new data integrity algorithms are defined:
The Hashed Message Authentication Code (HMAC) mechanism was originally defined in [RFC2104] and has been updated in [RFC6151].
The SHA 2 family of secure hash algorithms is defined in [FIPS 180 3].
Sample code for the SHA based HMAC algorithms are available in [RFC6234].
, HMAC SHA2 224 and HMAC
SHA2 384 algorithms, were considered but not added to this list as they have the same computational requirements of HMAC SHA2 256 and HMAC
SHA2 512, respectively, and do not seem to be much used in practice.
Test vectors for use of HMAC with SHA 2 are provided in [RFC4231].
Users, implementors, and administrators may choose to put these new MACs into the proposal ahead of the REQUIRED hmac sha1 algorithm defined in [RFC4253] so that they are negotiated first.
This document augments the MAC Algorithm Names in [RFC4253] and [RFC4250].
The security considerations of RFC 4253 [RFC4253] apply to this document.
The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) publications:
[800 107] and NIST SP 800 131A [800 131A] suggest that HMAC SHA1 and HMAC SHA2 256 have a security strength of 128 bits and 256 bits, respectively, which are considered acceptable key lengths.
Many users seem to be interested in the perceived safety of using the SHA2 based algorithms for hashing.
