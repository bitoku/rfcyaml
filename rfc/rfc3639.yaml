  - "1.  Introduction\n   This memo describes some considerations relating to the\
    \ use of IP\n   protocol number fields and payload protocol (e.g., TCP) port or\n\
    \   service fields to identify particular services that may be associated\n  \
    \ with that port number or protocol number.  It is a general statement\n   regarding\
    \ appropriate processing and use of service identifiers by\n   intermediate systems.\n\
    \   This memo points out that various measures by intermediate systems\n   that\
    \ are intended to filter or prevent the transmission of traffic\n   based on the\
    \ service identification within the traffic flow will have\n   a limited effect.\
    \   This will also have a major side-effect of\n   forcing the affected services\
    \ to be redesigned using various forms of\n   encapsulation or dynamic port negotiation\
    \ in order to remove the\n   fixed service identification from the IP packet headers.\
    \  The IAB\n   does not believe this serves the general interests of the Internet\n\
    \   community related to the design of simple and reliable Internet\n   applications.\
    \  This memo suggests some thought be given to control\n   mechanisms that do\
    \ not rely on intermediary systems taking actions\n   based on an assumed relationship\
    \ between the service identifier in\n   the packet and the actual service of which\
    \ the packet is a part.\n"
- title: 2.  Service Identifiers
  contents:
  - "2.  Service Identifiers\n   Although not necessarily by design, certain conventions\
    \ have evolved\n   with respect to the IP protocol suite relative to the identification\n\
    \   of services within an IP traffic flow:\n   o  Within the IP protocol suite,\
    \ end point identifiers (e.g.,\n      TCP/UDP/SCTP port numbers, IP protocol numbers)\
    \ are designed to\n      identify services to end points.  In particular, TCP,\
    \ UDP or SCTP\n      (Stream Control Transmission Protocol) port numbers are intended\n\
    \      to identify the source service location and the destination\n      service\
    \ entity to the destination end point.\n   o  The IP [2] datagram header contains\
    \ the source and destination\n      address of the datagram as well as an indication\
    \ of the upper-\n      level protocol (ULP) carried within the datagram.  If the\
    \ ULP is\n      either TCP [3], UDP [1], or SCTP [8] the payload will contain\
    \ both\n      source and destination port numbers which allows differentiation\n\
    \      between services (e.g., TELNET, HTTP) and between multiple\n      instances\
    \ of the same service between the pair of hosts described\n      by the source\
    \ and destination address.\n   o  By convention, for at least TCP and UDP, certain\
    \ port numbers are\n      used as rendezvous points and are considered \"well\
    \ known\" on the\n      source or destination side of the communication.  Such\
    \ rendezvous\n      points are maintained in an IANA registry currently located\
    \ at\n      [11].  Specific registries for protocol and port numbers are at\n\
    \      [12] and [13].\n   o  Notwithstanding the \"well knownness\" of any given\
    \ port, port\n      numbers are only guaranteed to be meaningful to the end systems.\n\
    \      An intermediate system should generally not impute specific\n      meaning\
    \ to any given port number, unless specifically indicated by\n      an end system\
    \ (e.g., via the Resource Reservation Protocol (RSVP)\n      [4]) or agreed to\
    \ by convention among the end systems and one or\n      more specific intermediate\
    \ systems (e.g., firewall traversal for\n      the IP Security Protocol (IPSEC)\
    \ [5]).\n   o  Some services make use of protocol interactions to dynamically\n\
    \      allocate service identifiers (i.e., port numbers) to specific\n      communications.\
    \  One specific example of this is the Session\n      Initiation Protocol (SIP)\
    \ [9].  The implication of this is that\n      intermediate systems cannot relate\
    \ the service identifiers to the\n      actual service unless they participate\
    \ in the protocols which\n      allocate the service identifiers, or are explicitly\
    \ notified of\n      the outcome of the allocation.\n   o  Various products and\
    \ service-related mechanisms deployed today\n      take advantage of the fact\
    \ that some service identifiers are\n      relatively stable (and well known)\
    \ to do various things (e.g.,\n      firewall filtering, QOS marking).\n   o \
    \ Certain network operations, such as various forms of packet\n      encapsulation\
    \ (e.g., tunneling) and encryption, can occlude this\n      port number (or service\
    \ identifier) while an IP packet is in\n      transit within the network.  For\
    \ example, both the IPSEC\n      Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) [6] and\
    \ Generic Routing\n      Encapsulation (GRE) [7] both provide means for tunneling\
    \ an IP\n      datagram within another IP datagram.  The service information\n\
    \      becomes obscured and, in some instances, encrypted.\n   o  Cooperating\
    \ end systems may elect to use arbitrarily selected port\n      numbers for any\
    \ service.  The port numbers used in such cases may\n      be statically defined,\
    \ through coordinated configuration of the\n      cooperating end systems through\
    \ use of a common application or\n      operating system, or by dynamic selection\
    \ as an outcome of a\n      rendezvous protocol.\n   Intermediate system imposed\
    \ service-based controls may block\n   legitimate uses by subscribers.  For example,\
    \ some service providers\n   are blocking port 25 (i.e., notionally SMTP) traffic\
    \ for the stated\n   purpose of trying to prevent SPAM, but which can also block\n\
    \   legitimate email to the end user.\n   Attempts by intermediate systems to\
    \ impose service-based controls on\n   communications against the perceived interests\
    \ of the end parties to\n   the communication are often circumvented [10].  Services\
    \ may be\n   tunneled within other services, proxied by a collaborating external\n\
    \   host (e.g., an anonymous redirector), or simply run over an alternate\n  \
    \ port (e.g., port 8080 vs port 80 for HTTP).  Another means of\n   circumvention\
    \ is alteration of the service behavior to use a dynamic\n   port negotiation\
    \ phase, in order to avoid use of a constant port\n   address.\n   For the purposes\
    \ of this memo, a \"party to a communication\" is either\n   the sender, receiver,\
    \ or an authorized agent of the sender or\n   receiver in the path.\n   If intermediate\
    \ systems take actions on behalf of one or more parties\n   to the communication\
    \ or affecting the communication, a good rule of\n   thumb is they should only\
    \ take actions that are beneficial to or\n   approved by one or more of the parties,\
    \ within the operational\n   parameters of the service-specific protocol, or otherwise\
    \ unlikely to\n   lead to widespread evasion by the user community.\n"
- title: 3.  Ramifications
  contents:
  - "3.  Ramifications\n   The IAB observes that having stable and globally meaningful\
    \ service\n   identifiers visible at points other than the end systems can be\n\
    \   useful for the purposes of determining network behavior and network\n   loading\
    \ on a macro level.  The IAB also observes that application\n   protocols that\
    \ include dynamic port negotiation for both ends of a\n   connection tend to add\
    \ to the complexity of the applications.\n   Dynamic port negotiation for a protocol\
    \ may also limit or prohibit\n   its use in situations where the service provider\
    \ (e.g., ISP or\n   employer) has instituted some form of service filtering through\
    \ port\n   blocking mechanisms.\n   From this perspective of network and application\
    \ utility, it is\n   preferable that no action or activity be undertaken by any\
    \ agency,\n   carrier, service provider, or organization which would cause end-\n\
    \   users and protocol designers to generally obscure service\n   identification\
    \ information from the IP packet header.\n   Nothing in this statement should\
    \ be construed as opposing\n   encapsulation, application security, end-to-end\
    \ encryption, or other\n   processes beneficial or specifically desired by the\
    \ end-users.\n"

    \ general network analysis, end-user beneficial filtering (e.g.,\n   preventing\
    \ DDOS attacks), and other common uses of these service\n   identifiers might\
    \ be adversely affected.\n"
