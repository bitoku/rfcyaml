- title: 1. The SNMP Management Framework

  - "1. The SNMP Management Framework\n   The SNMP Management Framework presently\
    \ consists of five major\n   components:\n   o  An overall architecture, described\
    \ in RFC 2571 [1].\n   o  Mechanisms for describing and naming objects and events\
    \ for the\n      purpose of management. The first version of this Structure of\n\
    \      Management Information (SMI) is called SMIv1 and described in STD\n   \
    \   16, RFC 1155 [2], STD 16, RFC 1212 [3] and RFC 1215 [4]. The\n      second\
    \ version, called SMIv2, is described in STD 58, RFC 2578\n      [5], STD 58,\
    \ RFC 2579 [6] and STD 58, RFC 2580 [7].\n   o  Message protocols for transferring\
    \ management information.  The\n      first version of the SNMP message protocol\
    \ is called SNMPv1 and\n      described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [8]. A second version\
    \ of the SNMP\n      message protocol, which is not an Internet standards track\n\
    \      protocol, is called SNMPv2c and described in RFC 1901 [9] and RFC\n   \
    \   1906 [10]. The third version of the message protocol is called\n      SNMPv3\
    \ and described in RFC 1906 [10], RFC 2572 [11] and RFC 2574\n      [12].\n  \
    \ o  Protocol operations for accessing management information. The\n      first\
    \ set of protocol operations and associated PDU formats is\n      described in\
    \ STD 15, RFC 1157 [8]. A second set of protocol\n      operations and associated\
    \ PDU formats is described in RFC 1905\n      [13].\n   o  A set of fundamental\
    \ applications described in RFC 2573 [14] and\n      the view-based access control\
    \ mechanism described in RFC 2575\n      [15].\n   A more detailed introduction\
    \ to the current SNMP Management Framework\n   can be found in RFC 2570 [16].\n\
    \   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed\n   the\
    \ Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are\n   defined using\
    \ the mechanisms defined in the SMI.\n   This memo specifies a MIB module that\
    \ is compliant to the SMIv2. A\n   MIB conforming to the SMIv1 can be produced\
    \ through the appropriate\n   translations. The resulting translated MIB must\
    \ be semantically\n   equivalent, except where objects or events are omitted because\
    \ no\n   translation is possible (use of Counter64). Some machine readable\n \
    \  information in SMIv2 will be converted into textual descriptions in\n   SMIv1\
    \ during the translation process. However, this loss of machine\n   readable information\
    \ is not considered to change the semantics of the\n   MIB.\n"

  contents:
  - "2. Overview\n   A Fibre Channel Fabric is an entity which interconnects Node\
    \ Ports\n   (N_Ports) or Node Loop Ports (NL_Ports).  It provides transport and\n\
    \   routing functions.  In essence, a Fabric is a network of N_Ports\n   and/or\
    \ NL_Ports to communicate with one another.  A Fabric is\n   composed of one or\
    \ more Fabric Element that are interconnected via\n   Inter-element Links (IEL).\
    \  A Fabric Element is the smallest unit of\n   a Fabric that meets the definition\
    \ of a Fabric.  It must consist of\n   at least three external ports to connect\
    \ to either N_Ports, NL_Ports\n   or other Fabric Elements.  In general, a Fabric\
    \ Element port may be\n   of one of the following types:\n   (1) F_Port, a fabric\
    \ port to connect to an N_Port ([17], [21], [22]);\n   (2)  FL_Port, a fabric\
    \ port that also supports a FC Arbitrated Loop\n       consisting of one or more\
    \ NL_Ports ([20], [24]).\n   (3)  E_Port, an expansion port to connect to another\
    \ Fabric Element\n       ([18], [23]);\n   This memo shall define objects related\
    \ to a Fabric Element, its\n   F_Ports and FL_Ports.  Objects related to other\
    \ types of FC ports\n   shall be defined in future.\n   For the rest of the document,\
    \ the term, \"FxPort\", will be used to\n   refer to both F_Port and FL_Port where\
    \ the distinction is not\n   necessary.  The term, \"NxPort\" will be used to\
    \ refer to both N_Port\n   and NL_Port in the similar fashion.\n"
- title: 2.1. Management View of a Fabric Element
  contents:
  - "2.1. Management View of a Fabric Element\n   From the management perspective,\
    \ it is helpful to view a Fabric\n   Element to be consisting of multiple \"modules\"\
    .  Each module is a\n   grouping, either physical or logical, of one or more ports\
    \ that may\n   be managed as a sub-entity within the Fabric Element.\n   This\
    \ module mapping is recommended but optional.  A vendor may elect\n   to put all\
    \ ports into a single module, or to divide the ports into\n   modules that do\
    \ not match physical divisions.\n   The object fcFeModuleCapacity indicates the\
    \ maximum number of modules\n   that a given Fabric Element may contain.  This\
    \ value must remain\n   constant from one management restart to the next.\n  \
    \ Each module is uniquely identified by a module number in the range of\n   1\
    \ through fcFeModuleCapacity inclusive.  Modules may come and go\n   without causing\
    \ a management reset (of sysUpTime), and may be\n   sparsely numbered within the\
    \ Fabric Element.  That is, the module\n   numbering is not required to be contiguous.\
    \  For instance, if a\n   module is mapped physically to a field-replaceable card\
    \ and in a 13-\n   card cage Fabric Element, cards 3, 5, 6 and 7 may be installed.\
    \  The\n   vendor may choose to label them as modules 3, 5, 6 and 7\n   respectively.\
    \  In this example, the value of fcFeModuleCapacity is\n   13.  Note that the\
    \ object fcFeModuleLastChange acts as the\n   discontinuity indicator for all\
    \ counter objects in this MIB.\n   A Fabric Element may also provide a proxy management\
    \ on behalf of\n   another management entity by presenting it as one of its Fabric\n\
    \   Element modules.\n   The object fcFeModuleFxPortCapacity indicates the maximum\
    \ number of\n   ports that a given module may contain.  The value of\n   fcFeModuleFxPortCapacity\
    \ must not change for a given module.\n   However, a module may be deleted from\
    \ the Fabric Element and replaced\n   with a module containing a different number\
    \ of ports.  The value of\n   fcFeModuleLastChange will indicate that a change\
    \ took place.\n   Each port within the Fabric Element is uniquely identified by\
    \ a\n   combination of module index and port index, where port index is an\n \
    \  integer in the range (1..fcFeModuleFxPortCapacity).  As with modules\n   within\
    \ a Fabric Element, ports within a module may be sparsely\n   numbered.  That\
    \ is the port numbering is not required to be\n   contiguous.  Likewise, ports\
    \ may come and go within a module without\n   causing a management reset.\n  \
    \ In terms of attachment, an F_Port will be attached to another N_Port;\n   and\
    \ an FL_Port will be attached to one or up to 126 NL_Ports.  In\n   general, an\
    \ FxPort may be attached to one or more NxPorts.  Each\n   NxPort associated with\
    \ an FxPort will be uniquely identified by a\n   combination of module index,\
    \ FxPort index and NxPort index.  An\n   NxPort index is an integer in the range\
    \ (1..126).  The following\n   diagram illustrates the management view of a Fabric\
    \ Element.\n           #=======================================================#\n\

  contents:
  - "2.2. Structure of the Fabric Element MIB\n   This memo assumes that a Fabric\
    \ Element has an SNMP entity associated\n   with its managed objects.  The managed\
    \ objects are divided as follow:\n         - the Configuration group\n       \
    \  - the Status group\n         - the Error group\n         - the Accounting group\n\
    \         - the Capability group\n   In each group, scalar objects and table entries\
    \ are defined.\n   The Configuration group contains configuration and service\
    \ parameters\n   for the Fabric Element, modules and the FxPorts.\n   The Operation\
    \ group contains the operational status and parameters of\n   an FxPort.  The\
    \ group also contains the service parameters that have\n   been established between\
    \ the FxPort and its attached NxPort, if\n   applicable.\n   The Error group contains\
    \ counters tracking various types of errors\n   detected by each FxPort.  The\
    \ information may be used for diagnostics\n   and/or to derive the quality of\
    \ the link between an FxPort and one or\n   more attached NxPorts.\n   The Accounting\
    \ group contains statistic data suitable for deriving\n   accounting and performance\
    \ information.\n   The Capability group contains parameters indicating the inherent\n\
    \   capability of the Fabric Element and each FxPort.\n"

- title: 4. Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "4. Security Considerations\n   There are a number of management objects defined\
    \ in this MIB that\n   have a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write.  Such objects may\
    \ be\n   considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.  The\n\
    \   support for SET operations in a non-secure environment without proper\n  \
    \ protection can have a negative effect on network operations.\n   SNMPv1 by itself\
    \ is not a secure environment.  Even if the network\n   itself is secure (for\
    \ example by using IPSec), even then, there is no\n   control as to who on the\
    \ secure network is allowed to access and\n   GET/SET (read/change/create/delete)\
    \ the objects in this MIB.\n   It is recommended that the implementers consider\
    \ the security\n   features as provided by the SNMPv3 framework.  Specifically,\
    \ the use\n   of the User-based Security Model RFC 2574 [12] and the View-based\n\
    \   Access Control Model RFC 2575 [15] is recommended.\n   It is then a customer/user\
    \ responsibility to ensure that the SNMP\n   entity giving access to an instance\
    \ of this MIB, is properly\n   configured to give access to the objects only to\
    \ those principals\n   (users) that have legitimate rights to indeed GET or SET\n\
    \   (change/delete) them.\n"
