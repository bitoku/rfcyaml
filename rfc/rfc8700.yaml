  - "1.  Introduction\n   The RFC Series began in April 1969 with the publication\
    \ of \"Host\n   Software\" by Steve Crocker.  The early RFCs were, in fact, requests\n\
    \   for comments on ideas and proposals; the goal was to start\n   conversations\
    \ rather than to create an archival record of a standard\n   or best practice.\
    \  This goal changed over time, as the formality of\n   the publication process\
    \ evolved and the community consuming the\n   material grew.  Today, over 8500\
    \ RFCs have been published, ranging\n   across best practice guidance, experimental\
    \ protocols, informational\n   material, and, of course, Internet standards. \
    \ Material is accepted\n   for publication through the IETF, the IAB, the IRTF,\
    \ and the\n   Independent Submissions streams, each of which have clear processes\n\
    \   on how drafts are submitted and potentially approved for publication\n   as\
    \ an RFC.  Ultimately, the goal of the RFC Series is to provide a\n   canonical\
    \ source for the material published by the RFC Editor and to\n   support the preservation\
    \ of that material in perpetuity.\n   The RFC Editor as a role came a few years\
    \ after the first RFC was\n   published.  The actual date the term \"RFC Editor\"\
    \ was first used is\n   unknown, but it was formalized by [RFC0902] in July 1984;\
    \ Jon Postel,\n   the first RFC Editor, defined the role by his actions and later\
    \ by\n   defining the initial processes surrounding the publication of RFCs.\n\
    \   What is certain is that the goal of the RFC Editor is to produce\n   documents\
    \ that are readable, clear, consistent, and reasonably\n   uniform, and that the\
    \ archival record of what has been published is\n   maintained.\n   Change does\
    \ come to the Series, albeit slowly.  First, we saw the\n   distribution method\
    \ change from postal mail to FTP and then to email.\n   RFCs could not be distributed\
    \ electronically in the beginning, as the\n   means to do that distribution would\
    \ not be defined until years after\n   the first RFC was \"published\".  Not all\
    \ early RFCs were even created\n   electronically; some were written out by hand\
    \ or on a typewriter.\n   Eventually, the process for creating RFCs became more\
    \ structured;\n   authors were provided guidance on how to write an RFC.  The\
    \ editorial\n   effort went from Steve Crocker to a more official model with a\n\
    \   designated editor, Jon Postel, and later to a team of five to seven\n   individuals.\
    \  The actual editing and publishing work split from the\n   service for registration\
    \ of protocol code points.  The whole RFC\n   Editor structure was reviewed [RFC4844],\
    \ refined [RFC5620], and\n   refined again [RFC6635].  And, in the last few years,\
    \ the process to\n   change the format of the RFC documents themselves has started\n\
    \   [RFC7990].\n   This is evolution; and the Series will continue to be adapted\
    \ in\n   order to meet the needs and expectations of the implementers,\n   operators,\
    \ historians, and community of authors that uses the RFC\n   Series.  These changes\
    \ will always be balanced against the core\n   mission of the Series: to maintain\
    \ a strong, stable, archival record\n   of technical specifications, protocols,\
    \ and other information\n   relevant to the Advanced Research Projects Agency\
    \ Network (ARPANET)\n   and Internet networking communities.\n   There is more\
    \ to the history of the RFC Series than can be covered in\n   this document. \
    \ Readers interested in earlier perspectives may find\n   the following RFCs of\
    \ particular interest.  These RFCs focus on the\n   enormous contributions of\
    \ Jon Postel, Czar of Socket Numbers\n   [RFC0433] and first RFC Editor:\n   *\
    \  [RFC2441]\"Working with Jon, Tribute delivered at UCLA, October 30,\n     \
    \ 1998\"\n   *  [RFC2555]\"30 Years of RFCs\"\n   *  [RFC5540]\"40 Years of RFCs\"\
    \n   In this document, the history of the Series is viewed through the\n   eyes\
    \ of several individuals who have been a part of shaping it.\n   Narratives of\
    \ this nature offer a limited perspective on events;\n   there are almost certainly\
    \ other viewpoints, memories, and\n   perspectives on events that are equally\
    \ valid and would reflect a\n   different history.  So, while these retrospectives\
    \ are enormously\n   valuable and provide an insight to events of the day, they\
    \ are just\n   one lens on the history of the RFC Series.\n   Steve Crocker, author\
    \ of [RFC0001], offers his thoughts on how and\n   why the Series began.  Leslie\
    \ Daigle, a major influence in the\n   development of the RFC Editor model, offers\
    \ her thoughts on the\n   change of the RFC Editor to a stronger, contracted function.\
    \  Nevil\n   Brownlee, Independent Submissions Editor from 2010 through February\n\
    \   2018, shares his view on the clarification of the Independent Stream\n   (IS)\
    \ and its transition upon the retirement of Bob Braden from the\n   position.\
    \  As the current RFC Series Editor, I will put my thoughts\n   in on the most\
    \ recent changes in formalizing the digital preservation\n   of the Series, the\
    \ process to modernize the format while respecting\n   the need for stability,\
    \ and my thoughts on the next fifty years of\n   RFCs.\n   This document updates\
    \ the perspectives offered in [RFC2555] and\n   [RFC5540].\n"

  - "3.1.  The Origins of RFCs - by Stephen D. Crocker\n   (This is a revision of\
    \ material included more than 30 years ago in\n   [RFC1000].)\n   The Internet\
    \ community now includes millions of nodes and billions of\n   users.  It owes\
    \ its beginning to the ARPANET, which was once but a\n   gleam in the eyes of\
    \ J. C. R. Licklider, Bob Taylor, and Larry\n   Roberts of the Advanced Research\
    \ Projects Agency (ARPA).  While much\n   of the development proceeded according\
    \ to plan, the initial design of\n   the protocols and the creation of the RFCs\
    \ was largely accidental.\n   The procurement of the ARPANET was initiated in\
    \ the summer of 1968;\n   remember Vietnam, flower children, etc.? There had been\
    \ prior\n   experiments at various ARPA sites to link together computer systems,\n\
    \   but this was the first version to explore packet switching as a core\n   part\
    \ of the communication strategy.  (\"ARPA\" didn't become \"DARPA\"\n   (Defense\
    \ Advanced Research Projects Agency) until 1972.  It briefly\n   changed back\
    \ to ARPA in 1993 and then back again to DARPA.)  The\n   government's Request\
    \ for Quotations (RFQ) called for four packet-\n   switching devices, called Interface\
    \ Message Processors (\"IMPs\"), to\n   be delivered to four sites in the western\
    \ part of the United States:\n   University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA);\
    \ SRI International\n   (Stanford Research Institute) in Menlo Park, CA; University\
    \ of\n   California, Santa Barbara (UCSB); and the University of Utah in Salt\n\
    \   Lake City.  These sites were running a Scientific Data Systems (SDS)\n   Sigma\
    \ 7, an SDS 940, an IBM 360/75, and a DEC PDP-10, respectively.\n   These machines\
    \ not only had different operating systems, but even\n   details like character\
    \ sets and byte sizes varied.  Other sites would\n   have further variations.\n\
    \   The focus was on the basic movement of data.  The precise use of the\n   ARPANET\
    \ was not spelled out in advance, thus requiring the research\n   community to\
    \ take some initiative.  To stimulate this process, a\n   meeting was called in\
    \ August 1968 with representatives from the\n   selected sites, chaired by Elmer\
    \ Shapiro from SRI.  Based on\n   Shapiro's notes from that meeting, the attendees\
    \ were Dave Hopper and\n   Jeff Rulifson from SRI; Glen Culler and Gordon Buck\
    \ from Santa\n   Barbara; R.  Stephenson, C.  Stephen Carr, and W.  Boam from\
    \ Utah;\n   Vint Cerf and me from UCLA; and a few others from potential future\n\
    \   sites.\n   That first meeting was seminal.  We had lots of questions.  How\
    \ would\n   IMPs and \"hosts\" (I think that was the first time I was exposed\
    \ to\n   that term) be connected?  What would hosts say to each other?  What\n\
    \   applications would be supported?  The only concrete answers were\n   remote\
    \ login as a replacement for dial-up, telephone-based\n   interactive terminal\
    \ access, and file transfer, but we knew the\n   vision had to be larger.  We\
    \ found ourselves imagining all kinds of\n   possibilities: interactive graphics,\
    \ cooperating processes, automatic\n   database query, electronic mail, etc.,\
    \ but no one knew where to\n   begin.  We weren't sure whether there was really\
    \ room to think hard\n   about these problems; surely someone senior and in charge,\
    \ likely\n   from the East, would be along by and by to bring the word.  But we\n\
    \   did come to one conclusion: we ought to meet again.  Over the next\n   several\
    \ months, we met at each of our sites, thereby setting the\n   precedent for regular\
    \ face-to-face meetings.  We also instantly felt\n   the irony.  This new network\
    \ was supposed to make it possible to work\n   together at a distance, and the\
    \ first thing we did was schedule a\n   significant amount of travel.\n   Over\
    \ the next several months, a small, fairly consistent set of\n   graduate students\
    \ and staff members from the first four sites met.\n   We used the term Network\
    \ Working Group (NWG) to designate ourselves.\n   This was the same term Elmer\
    \ Shapiro had used when he convened our\n   first meeting, although it had been\
    \ used until that point to refer to\n   the principal investigators and ARPA personnel:\
    \ senior people who had\n   been planning the network.  Our group was junior and\
    \ disjointed from\n   the prior group, except, of course, that each of us worked\
    \ for one of\n   the principal investigators.\n   The first few meetings were\
    \ quite tenuous, primarily because we\n   weren't sure how narrow or expansive\
    \ our goals should be.  We had no\n   official charter or leadership, and it remained\
    \ unclear, at least to\n   me, whether someone or some group would show up with\
    \ the official\n   authority and responsibility to take over the problems we were\n\
    \   dealing with.  Without clear definition of what the host-IMP\n   interface\
    \ would look like, or even a precise definition of what\n   functions the IMP\
    \ would provide, we focused on broader ideas.  We\n   envisioned the possibility\
    \ of application-specific protocols, with\n   code downloaded to user sites, and\
    \ we took a crack at designing a\n   language to support this.  The first version\
    \ was known as DEL, for\n   \"Decode-Encode Language\" and a later version was\
    \ called NIL, for\n   \"Network Interchange Language\".\n   In late 1968, Bolt\
    \ Beranek and Newman (BBN) in Cambridge, MA won the\n   contract for the IMPs\
    \ and began work in January 1969.  A few of us\n   flew to Boston in the middle\
    \ of February to meet the BBN crew.  The\n   BBN folks, led by Frank Heart, included\
    \ Bob Kahn, Severo Ornstein,\n   Ben Barker, Will Crowther, Bernie Cosell, and\
    \ Dave Walden.  They were\n   organized, professional, and focused.  Their first\
    \ concern was how to\n   meet their contract schedule of delivering the first\
    \ IMP to UCLA at\n   the beginning of September and how to get bits to flow quickly\
    \ and\n   reliably.  The details of the host-IMP interface were not yet firm;\n\
    \   the specification came a few months later as BBN Report 1822.  In\n   particular,\
    \ BBN didn't take over our protocol design process, nor did\n   any other source\
    \ of authority appear.  Thus, we doggedly continued\n   debating and designing\
    \ the protocols.\n   A month later, our small NWG met in Utah.  As the meeting\
    \ came toward\n   an end, it became clear to us that we should start writing down\
    \ our\n   discussions.  We had accumulated a few notes on the design of DEL and\n\
    \   other matters, and we decided to put them together in a set of notes.\n  \
    \ We assigned writing chores to each of us, and I took on the\n   additional task\
    \ of organizing the notes.  Though I initiated the\n   RFCs, my role was far less\
    \ than an editor.  Each of the RFCs were\n   numbered in sequence.  The only rule\
    \ I imposed was the note had to be\n   complete before I assigned a number because\
    \ I wanted to minimize the\n   number of holes in the sequence.\n   I tried a\
    \ couple of times to write a note on how the notes would be\n   organized, but\
    \ I found myself full of trepidation.  Would these notes\n   look as if we were\
    \ asserting authority we didn't have?  Would we\n   unintentionally offend whomever\
    \ the official protocol designers were?\n   Finally, unable to sleep, I wrote\
    \ a few humble words.  The basic\n   ground rules were that anyone could say anything\
    \ and that nothing was\n   official.  And to emphasize the point, I used Bill\
    \ Duvall's\n   suggestion and labeled the notes \"Request for Comments\".  I never\n\
    \   dreamed these notes would eventually be distributed through the very\n   medium\
    \ we were discussing in these notes: talk about Sorcerer's\n   Apprentice!  (See\
    \ [APPRENTICE].)\n   After BBN distributed the specification for the IMP hardware\
    \ and\n   software interface to the initial ARPANET sites, our attention\n   shifted\
    \ to low-level matters.  The ambitious ideas for automatic\n   downloading of\
    \ code evaporated.  It would be several years before\n   ideas like mobile code,\
    \ remote procedure calls, ActiveX, JAVA, and\n   Representational State Transfer\
    \ (RESTful) interfaces appeared.\n   Over the spring and summer of that year,\
    \ we grappled with the\n   detailed problems of protocol design.  Although we\
    \ had a vision of\n   the vast potential for intercomputer communication, designing\
    \ usable\n   protocols was another matter.  We knew a custom hardware interface\n\
    \   and a custom software addition in the operating system was going to\n   be\
    \ required for anything we designed, and we anticipated these would\n   pose some\
    \ difficulty at each of the sites.  We looked for existing\n   abstractions to\
    \ use.  It would have been convenient if we could have\n   made the network simply\
    \ look like a regular device, e.g., a tape\n   drive, but we knew that wouldn't\
    \ do.  The essence of this network was\n   peer-to-peer cooperation among the\
    \ machines and the processes running\n   inside them, not a central machine controlling\
    \ dependent devices.  We\n   settled on a virtual bit stream layer as the basic\
    \ building block for\n   the protocols; but even back then, we knew that some\
    \ applications\n   like voice might need to avoid that layer of software.  (Why\
    \ a\n   virtual bit stream instead of a virtual byte stream?  Because each\n \
    \  computer had its own notion of how many bits were in a byte.  8-bit\n   bytes\
    \ didn't become standard until a few years later.)\n   Over the next two years,\
    \ we developed, exchanged, and implemented\n   ideas.  I took a leave from UCLA\
    \ in June 1971 to spend time working\n   at ARPA.  Jon Postel took over the care\
    \ and feeding of the RFCs,\n   evolving the process and adding collaborators over\
    \ the next twenty-\n   seven years.\n   The rapid growth of the network and the\
    \ working group also led to a\n   large pile of RFCs.  When the 100th RFC was\
    \ in sight, Peggy Karp at\n   the MIT Research Establishment (MITRE) took on the\
    \ task of indexing\n   them.  That seemed like a large task then, and we could\
    \ have hardly\n   anticipated seeing more than 1000 RFCs several years later and\
    \ the\n   evolution toward Internet-Drafts yet later.\n   When we first started\
    \ working on the protocols, the network did not\n   exist.  Except for our occasional\
    \ face-to-face meetings, RFCs were\n   our only means of communication.  In [RFC0003],\
    \ I set the bar as low\n   as possible:\n      |  The content of a NWG note may\
    \ be any thought, suggestion, etc.\n      |  related to the HOST software or other\
    \ aspect of the network.\n      |  Notes are encouraged to be timely rather than\
    \ polished.\n      |  Philosophical positions without examples or other specifics,\n\
    \      |  specific suggestions or implementation techniques without\n      | \
    \ introductory or background explication, and explicit questions\n      |  without\
    \ any attempted answers are all acceptable.  The minimum\n      |  length for\
    \ a NWG note is one sentence.\n      |  \n      |  These standards (or lack of\
    \ them) are stated explicitly for two\n      |  reasons.  First, there is a tendency\
    \ to view a written\n      |  statement as ipso facto authoritative, and we hope\
    \ to promote\n      |  the exchange and discussion of considerably less than\n\
    \      |  authoritative ideas.  Second, there is a natural hesitancy to\n    \
    \  |  publish something unpolished, and we hope to ease this\n      |  inhibition.\n\
    \   Making the RFCs informal was not only a way of encouraging\n   participation;\
    \ it was also important in making the communication\n   effective.  One of the\
    \ early participants said he was having trouble\n   writing and sending an RFC\
    \ because his institution wanted to subject\n   them to publication review.  These\
    \ are not \"publications\", I\n   declared, and the problem went away.  Another\
    \ small detail, handled\n   instinctively and without debate, was the distribution\
    \ model.  Each\n   institution was required to send a copy directly to each of\
    \ the other\n   handful of participating institutions.  Each institution handled\n\
    \   internal copies and distribution itself.  Submission to a central\n   point\
    \ for redistribution was not required so as to minimize delays.\n   SRI's Network\
    \ Information Center, however, did maintain a central\n   repository of everything\
    \ and provided an invaluable record.\n   We didn't intentionally set out to challenge\
    \ the existing standards\n   organizations, but our natural mode of operation\
    \ yielded some\n   striking results.  The RFCs are open in two important respects:\n\
    \   anyone can write one for free and anyone can get them for free.  At\n   the\
    \ time, virtually everyone in the ARPANET community was sponsored\n   by the government,\
    \ so there was little competition and no need to use\n   documents as a way of\
    \ raising money.  Of course, as soon as we had\n   email working on the ARPANET,\
    \ we distributed RFCs electronically.\n   When the ARPANET became just a portion\
    \ of the Internet, this\n   distribution process became worldwide.  The effect\
    \ of this openness\n   is often overlooked; even now, students and young professionals\
    \ all\n   over the world have been able to download RFCs, learn about the\n  \
    \ technology within, and in turn, build the most amazing software.\n   (They are\
    \ also a fantastic resource for historians.)\n   Where will it end?  The ARPANET\
    \ begat the Internet, and the\n   underlying technology transitioned from the\
    \ original host-host\n   protocol to TCP/IP.  But, the superstructure of protocol\
    \ layers,\n   community-driven protocol design, and RFCs continued.  Through the\n\
    \   changes in physical-layer technology, resulting in speed increases\n   from\
    \ thousands to billions of bits per second, and similarly from\n   thousands to\
    \ billions of users, this superstructure, including the\n   RFCs, has continued\
    \ to serve the community.  All of the computers\n   have changed, as have all\
    \ of the transmission lines, but the RFCs\n   march on.  Maybe I'll write a few\
    \ words for RFC 10,000.\n   Quite obviously, the circumstances have changed. \
    \ Email and other\n   media are most often used for the immediate exchange of\
    \ inchoate\n   thoughts.  Internet-Drafts are the means for exchanging substantial,\n\
    \   albeit sometimes speculative, content, while RFCs are reserved for\n   fully\
    \ polished, reviewed, edited, and approved specifications.\n   Comments to RFCs\
    \ are not requested, although usage-related\n   discussions and other commentary\
    \ on mailing lists often take place\n   nonetheless.  Rather than bemoan the change,\
    \ I take it as a\n   remarkable example of adaptation.  RFCs continue to serve\
    \ the\n   protocol development community.  Indeed, they are the bedrock of a\n\
    \   very vibrant and productive process that has fueled and guided the\n   Internet\
    \ revolution.\n"

    \ when Steve left UCLA for ARPA.  Jon took on\n   this role in addition to his\
    \ subsequent \"numbers Czar\"\n   responsibilities.  Initially, his focus was\
    \ largely on assigning RFC\n   numbers to aspiring writers, but with time, and\
    \ as the\n   standardization of the ARPANET and Internet protocols continued\n\
    \   apace, he began to serve in an editorial capacity.  Moreover, as an\n   accomplished\

- title: 3.3.  Formalizing the RFC Editor Model - by Leslie Daigle
  contents:
  - "3.3.  Formalizing the RFC Editor Model - by Leslie Daigle\n   I was the chair\
    \ of the Internet Architecture Board, the board\n   responsible for the general\
    \ oversight of the RFC Series, at a\n   particular inflection point in the evolution\
    \ of all Internet\n   technology institutions.  To understand what we did, and\
    \ why we had\n   to, let me first paint a broader picture of the arc of these\n\
    \   institutions.\n   Like many others who were in decision-making roles in the\
    \ mid '00s, I\n   wasn't present when the Internet was born.  The lore passed\
    \ down to\n   me was that, out of the group of talented researchers that developed\n\
    \   the core specifications and established the direction of the\n   Internet,\
    \ different individuals stepped up to take on roles necessary\n   to keep the\
    \ process of specification development organized and open.\n   As the work of\
    \ specification expanded, those individuals were\n   generally supported by organizations\
    \ that carried on in the same\n   spirit.  This was mostly Jon Postel, managing\
    \ the allocation and\n   assignment of names and numbers, as well as working as\
    \ the editor of\n   RFCs, but there were also individuals and institutions supporting\
    \ the\n   IETF's Secretariat function.  By the late 20th century, even this\n\
    \   model was wearing thin; the support functions were growing, and\n   organizations\
    \ didn't have the ability to donate even more resources\n   to run them.  In some\
    \ cases (IANA), there was significant industry\n   and international dependence\
    \ on the function and its neutrality.\n   The IETF, too, had grown in size, stature,\
    \ and commercial reliance.\n   This system of institutional pieces \"flying in\
    \ formation\" was not\n   providing the kind of contractual regularity or integrated\n\
    \   development that the IETF needed.  People who hadn't been there as\n   the\
    \ institutions developed, including IETF decision makers, didn't\n   innately\
    \ understand why things \"had to be the way they were\" and were\n   frustrated\
    \ when trying to get individual systems updated for new\n   requirements as well\
    \ as better integrated across the spectrum of\n   activities.\n   Internet engineering\
    \ had expanded beyond the point of being\n   supportable by a loosely coupled\
    \ set of organizations of people who\n   had been there since the beginning and\
    \ knew each other well.  New\n   forms of governance were needed along with a\
    \ rationalized funding\n   model.  The IANA function was absorbed into a purpose-built\n\
    \   international not-for-profit organization.  The IETF stepped up to\n   manage\
    \ its own organizational destiny, creating the IETF\n   Administrative Support\
    \ Activity (IASA), and the Secretariat became\n   one of its contracted functions.\n\
    \   This left the RFC Editor function as an independent effort supported\n   by\
    \ the Internet Society.\n   That independent nature was necessary for the historic\
    \ role of the\n   RFC Series in considering all technical contributions.  But,\
    \ at that\n   inflection point in the Series' history, it needed a new governance\n\
    \   and funding model, just as the other organizations supporting\n   Internet\
    \ technical specification had.  Also, the IETF leadership had\n   some concerns\
    \ it felt needed to be addressed in its own technical\n   publication stream.\
    \  While the RFC Series had been established before\n   there was an IETF, and\
    \ had historically continued to have documents\n   in it that didn't originate\
    \ from the IETF, the IETF was its largest\n   and most organized contributor.\
    \  There was no particular organization\n   of independent contributors.  Equally,\
    \ the funding for the RFC Editor\n   was at that point coming from the Internet\
    \ Society in the guise of\n   \"support for the IETF\".  For people who hadn't\
    \ been involved with the\n   institution from the outset, it was pretty easy to\
    \ perceive the RFC\n   Series uniquely as the IETF's publication series.  So,\
    \ the challenge\n   was to identify and address the IETF's issues, along with\
    \ governance\n   and funding, without sacrificing the fundamental nature of the\
    \ RFC\n   Series as a broader-than-IETF publication series.\n   To give a sense\
    \ of the kind of tensions that were prevalent, let me\n   share that the one phrase\
    \ that stuck in my mind from those\n   discussions was \"push to publish\".  There\
    \ were those in IETF\n   leadership who felt that it would significantly reduce\
    \ costs and\n   improve timeliness if an RFC could be published by, literally,\n\
    \   pushing a button on a web interface the moment it was approved by the\n  \
    \ IESG.  It would also, they argued, remove the specification issues\n   being\
    \ introduced by copy editors that were hired as occasional\n   workers to help\
    \ with improving publication rates but who weren't\n   necessarily up to speed\
    \ on terms of art in technical specifications.\n   (There were some pretty egregious\
    \ examples of copy editors\n   introducing changes that significantly changed\
    \ the technical meaning\n   of the text that I forbear from citing here; let's\
    \ just say it wasn't\n   strictly a problem of Internet engineers getting uptight\
    \ about their\n   cheese being moved.)  While \"push to publish\" would have addressed\n\
    \   those issues, it would not have addressed the loss of clarity from\n   the\
    \ many significant text improvements copy editors successfully\n   introduced,\
    \ or the fact that not all RFCs are approved by the IESG.\n   Institutionally,\
    \ it was clear that the target was to have the RFC\n   Editor function governance\
    \ within the reach of the Internet technical\n   community (as opposed to any\
    \ particular private organization) without\n   tying it specifically to the IETF.\
    \  That was reasonably achievable by\n   ensuring that the resultant pieces were\
    \ established under the\n   oversight of the IAB (which is, itself, independent\
    \ of the IETF even\n   as it is supported by the IASA organization).\n   The IETF\
    \ worked on a document outlining functional requirements for\n   its technical\
    \ specification publication.  This could have been useful\n   for establishing\
    \ its own series, but it also was helpful in\n   establishing awareness of the\
    \ challenges in document publishing (it\n   always looks easy when you haven't\
    \ thought about it) and also in\n   laying the groundwork for dialogue with the\
    \ RFC Editor.  The\n   requirements document was published as [RFC4714] as an\
    \ Informational\n   RFC that stands today to provide guidance in the editing processes\n\
    \   surrounding IETF publications.\n   There was still, however, a certain lack\
    \ of clarity about\n   responsibilities for making decisions and changes in the\
    \ RFC Series\n   itself.  To that end, I and the IAB worked with the various involved\n\
    \   parties to produce [RFC4844].  That document captured the RFC Series\n   mission\
    \ (for a purpose greater than IETF technical specification\n   publication) as\
    \ well as the roles and responsibilities of the parties\n   involved.  The RFC\
    \ Editor is responsible for ensuring the\n   implementation of the mission.  The\
    \ IAB continues to have oversight\n   responsibilities, including policy oversight,\
    \ which it could act on\n   by changing the person (organization) in the role\
    \ of RFC Editor.  At\n   the same time, operational oversight was migrated to\
    \ the IASA support\n   function of the IETF (and IAB).\n   The discussions, and\
    \ the resulting publication of [RFC4844], allowed\n   greater visibility into\
    \ and commitment to the RFC Series as a general\n   Internet publication.  It\
    \ also meant that subsequent adjustments\n   could be made as requirements evolved;\
    \ the responsible parties are\n   clearly identified.\n"

  - "3.4.  The Continuation, or Creation, of a Stream - by Nevil Brownlee\n   Arguably\
    \ starting in 2006 with [RFC4714], the IAB and the IETF\n   community spent some\
    \ time in the mid-'00s evolving the structure of\n   the RFC Series.  This work\
    \ included defining how those groups that\n   published into the RFC Series (initially\
    \ including the IETF, the IAB\n   [RFC4845], and the Independent Submissions Stream\
    \ [RFC4846], and\n   later growing to include the IRTF [RFC5743]) would handle\
    \ approving\n   documents to be published as RFCs.  In 2009, the IAB published\
    \ \"RFC\n   Editor Model (Version 1)\" [RFC5620].  In this model, a new role was\n\
    \   created within the RFC Editor: the RFC Series Editor (RSE).  This\n   individual\
    \ would oversee RFC publishing and development while leaving\n   the process for\
    \ approving documents for publication outside his or\n   her mandate.  While,\
    \ arguably, this was a role long filled by people\n   like Jon Postel, Bob Braden,\
    \ and Joyce Reynolds, [RFC5620] saw the\n   role of RFC Series Editor defined\
    \ in such a way as to distinctly\n   separate it from that of the Independent\
    \ Submissions Editor (ISE).\n   Before 2009, the RFC Editor could accept \"Independent\"\
    \ submissions\n   from individuals and, if they were judged significant, publish\
    \ them\n   as RFCs; the Independent Stream was set up to continue that function.\n\
    \   From February 2010 through February 2018, I was the ISE.  After\n   reading\
    \ [RFC4846], I went on to develop the Independent Stream (IS).\n   First, I spent\
    \ several days at the RFC Production Center at the\n   Information Sciences Institute\
    \ (ISI) in Marina Del Ray with the RFC\n   Editor (Bob Braden), Sandy Ginoza,\
    \ and Alice Hagens so as to learn\n   how RFCs were actually edited and published.\
    \  All RFCs reach the\n   Production Center as Internet-Drafts; they are copy\
    \ edited until the\n   edited version can be approved by its authors (AUTH48).\
    \  At any\n   stage, authors can check their draft's status via the RFC Editor\n\
    \   website.\n   For the Independent Submissions, Bob kept a journal (a simple\
    \ ASCII\n   file) of his interactions with authors for every draft, indexed by\n\
    \   the draft name.  Bob also entered the Independent drafts into the RFC\n  \
    \ Editor database so that authors could track their draft's status.\n   After\
    \ my few days with his team at ISI, he handed that journal\n   (covering about\
    \ 30 drafts) over to me and said, \"Now it's over to\n   you!\"\n   I began by\
    \ following in Bob's footsteps, maintaining a journal and\n   tracking each draft's\
    \ status in the RFC Editor database.  My first\n   consideration was that every\
    \ serious Internet-Draft submitted needed\n   several careful reviews.  At that\
    \ time, if the ISE knew of suitable\n   reviewers, he or she could simply ask\
    \ them.  Otherwise, if the draft\n   related to an IETF or IRTF Working Group,\
    \ the ISE could ask Working\n   Group Chairs or Area Directors to suggest reviewers.\
    \  The Independent\n   Submissions Editorial Board (Ed Board) was another place\
    \ the ISE\n   could request reviewers from.  My experience with reviewers was\
    \ that\n   most of those I approached were happy to help.\n   Most drafts were\
    \ straightforward, but there were some that needed\n   extra attention.  Often,\
    \ a draft requested IANA code points, and for\n   that, IANA was always quick\
    \ to offer help and support.  Code points\n   in some IANA registries require\
    \ Expert Review [RFC8126]; sometimes\n   the interactions with Expert Reviewers\
    \ took quite a long time!\n   Again, sometimes a draft seemed to fit better in\
    \ the IETF Stream; for\n   these, I would suggest that the draft authors try to\
    \ find an Area\n   Director to sponsor their work as an individual submission\
    \ to the\n   IETF Stream.\n   After my first few years as ISE, the IETF Tools\
    \ Team developed the\n   Datatracker [DATATRACKER] to show draft status and perform\
    \ all the\n   \"housekeeping\" tasks for all of the streams.  At that stage, I\n\
    \   switched to using the Datatracker rather than the RFC Editor\n   database.\n\
    \   Once a draft has been reviewed and the authors have revised it in\n   dialogue\
    \ with their reviewers, the ISE must submit that draft to the\n   IESG for an\
    \ \"IESG Review\" [RFC5742].  Overall, each IS draft\n   benefited from discussions\
    \ (which were usually simple) with my Ed\n   Board and the IESG.  A (very) few\
    \ were somewhat controversial; for\n   those, I was able to work with the IESG\
    \ to negotiate a suitable \"IESG\n   Statement\" and/or an \"ISE Statement\" to\
    \ make it clear why the ISE\n   published the draft.\n   One rather special part\
    \ of the Independent Stream is the April 1st\n   RFCs.  These are humorous RFCs\
    \ that have no formal review and\n   approval process.  The authors must send\
    \ them directly to the ISE or\n   the RFC Editor.  Only a few of them can be published\
    \ each year, and\n   each is reviewed by the ISE and the RSE.  Bob Braden's criteria\
    \ for\n   April 1st drafts were:\n   *  They must relate to the Internet (like\
    \ all drafts).\n   *  Their readers should reach the end of page two before realizing\
    \ it\n      is an April 1st RFC.\n   *  They must actually be funny!\n   April\
    \ 1st RFCs have a large following, and feedback from the Internet\n   community\
    \ on April 1st of each year has been enthusiastic and quick!\n   159 RFCs were\
    \ published in the Independent Stream during my eight\n   years as ISE.  Over\
    \ those eight years, I worked with most of their\n   authors and often met with\
    \ them at IETF meetings.  For me, that was a\n   very rewarding experience, so\
    \ I thank all those that contributed.\n   During those eight years, I also worked\
    \ with most of the IESG\n   members, who all also gave me a lot of helpful interaction.\
    \  Lastly,\n   I've always enjoyed working with the RSE and all the staff of the\
    \ RFC\n   Production Center.  The IETF (as a whole) is very fortunate to have\n\
    \   such an effective team of talented professional staff.\n"

    \ Production Center,\n   Publisher, or Independent Submissions Editor.  All of\
    \ these roles\n   were performed by the \"RFC Editor\", which was comprised of\
    \ four\n   individuals: Bob Braden, Joyce Reynolds, a part-time student\n   programmer,\
    \ and me.\n   Bob provided high-level guidance and reviewed Independent\n   Submissions.\
    \  While Bob was a researcher in \"Div 7\" (Networking) at\n   ISI, ostensibly,\
    \ the percentage of time he had for the RFC Editor was\n   10%, but he invested\
    \ much more time to keep the Series running.  He\n   pitched in where he could,\
    \ especially when processing times were\n   getting longer; at one point, he even\
    \ NROFFed a couple of RFCs-to-be.\n   Joyce was a full-time ISI employee.  However,\
    \ while continuing to\n   ensure RFCs were published, she was also serving as\
    \ a User Services\n   Area Director and a keynote speaker about the Internet,\
    \ and she was\n   also temporarily on loan to IANA for 50% of her time while IANA\
    \ was\n   getting established after separating from ISI.  The student\n   programmer\
    \ performed programming tasks as requested and was, at the\n   time, responsible\
    \ for parsing MIBs.\n   I was a full-time staffer and had to quickly learn the\
    \ ropes so RFCs\n   would continue to be published.  My primary tasks were to\
    \ manage the\n   publication queue, format and prepare documents for Joyce's review,\n\
    \   carry out AUTH48 once Joyce completed her review, and publish, index,\n  \
    \ and archive the RFCs (both soft and hard copies).\n   The workload increased\
    \ significantly over the next few years.  As the\n   workload increased, the RFC\
    \ Editor reacted and slowly grew their\n   staff over time.  To understand the\
    \ team growth, let's first take a\n   look at the publication rates throughout\
    \ history.  The table below\n   shows average annual publication rates during\
    \ 5-year periods.\n                   |    Years    | Avg. Pubs per Year |\n \
    \                  | 1969 - 1972 |         80         |\n                   |\
    \ 1973 - 1977 |         55         |\n                   | 1978 - 1982 |     \
    \    20         |\n                   | 1983 - 1987 |         39         |\n \
    \                  | 1988 - 1992 |         69         |\n                   |\
    \ 1993 - 1997 |        171         |\n                   | 1998 - 2002 |     \
    \   237         |\n                   | 2003 - 2007 |        325         |\n \
    \                  | 2008 - 2012 |        333         |\n                   |\
    \ 2013 - 2017 |        295         |\n                    Table 2: Annual Publication\
    \ Rates\n   There were significant jumps in the publication rates in the '90s\
    \ and\n   onward, with the number of publications almost doubling between 1993\n\
    \   and 2007.  The annual submission count surpassed the 300 mark for the\n  \
    \ first time in 2004 and reached an all-time high of 385 in 2011.  The\n   submission\
    \ rate did not drop below 300 until 2016 (284).\n   As the submissions grew, the\
    \ RFC Editor experienced growing pains.\n   Processing times began to increase\
    \ as the existing staff was unable\n   to keep up with the expanding queue size.\
    \  In an attempt to reduce\n   the training hump and to avoid permanently hiring\
    \ staff in case the\n   submission burst was a fluke, ISI brought on temporary\
    \ copy editors;\n   this way, the staff could easily be resized as needed.  However,\
    \ as\n   Leslie noted, this didn't work very well.  The effects of the\n   experiment\
    \ would be lasting, as this led to a form of the process we\n   have now, where\
    \ the RFC Editor asks more questions during AUTH/AUTH48\n   and technical changes\
    \ require approval from the relevant Area\n   Directors or stream managers, depending\
    \ on the document stream.\n   These changes added to the workload and extended\
    \ publication times;\n   many often now jokingly refer to AUTH48 as the authors'\
    \ \"48 days\",\n   \"48 weeks\", etc.\n   In addition to the increase in document\
    \ submissions, we engaged in\n   tools testing and went through several editorial\
    \ process changes.\n   Because of the lesson learned with temporary copy editors,\
    \ our team\n   grew to be more permanent.  While we added other editors in between,\n\
    \   two additions are of particular interest, as they experienced much of\n  \
    \ the RFC Editor's growing pains, helped work us out of a backlogged\n   state,\
    \ shaped the RFC Editor function, and are still with the team\n   today: Alice\
    \ Russo joined the team in 2005 and Megan Ferguson joined\n   us in 2007.\n  \
    \ With the understanding that the record-breaking number of submissions\n   was\
    \ not an anomaly, we made significant upgrades to the\n   infrastructure of the\
    \ RFC Editor function to facilitate document\n   tracking and reporting.  For\
    \ example, the illustrious \"black binder\"\n   (an actual 3-ring binder used\
    \ to track RFC number assignment), a\n   manually edited HTML file for the queue\
    \ page, and a Rube Goldberg set\n   of text files and scripts that created queue\
    \ statistics, all were\n   eventually replaced; an errata system was proposed\
    \ and implemented;\n   and XML became a newly accepted source file.\n   In 2009,\
    \ [RFC5620] was published, introducing the initial version of\n   the RFC Editor\
    \ model we have now.  While it was published in 2009, it\n   did not go into effect\
    \ until 2010, when the RFC Editor project as I\n   knew it was disbanded and divvied\
    \ up into four pieces: RFC Series\n   Editor (RSE), Independent Submissions Editor\
    \ (ISE), RFC Production\n   Center (RPC), and the Publisher function.  In addition,\
    \ the RFC\n   Series Advisory Group (RSAG) was created to \"provide expert, informed\n\
    \   guidance (chiefly, to the RSE) in matters affecting the RFC Series\n   operation\
    \ and development\" [RSAG].\n   In 2010, the RPC and Publisher contracts were\
    \ awarded to Association\n   Management Solutions (AMS).  There, we started with\
    \ three existing\n   team members (Alice Russo, Megan Ferguson, and me), and we\
    \ were\n   pleased to be joined by Lynne Bartholomew and Rebecca VanRheenen, new\n\
    \   colleagues to anchor us in the AMS office.\n   I was wary of this model and\
    \ was especially worried about the hole\n   Bob Braden's departure would create.\
    \  Luckily for us, Bob Braden\n   provided wise counsel and insight during the\
    \ transition (and beyond).\n   He gave the staff transitioning to AMS particularly\
    \ helpful parting\n   words, \"keep the RFCs coming\", and that is what we did.\n\
    \   AMS embraced the RFC Series and helped us quickly get set up on new\n   servers.\
    \  The RFC Production Center and Publisher were now part of\n   the AMS family\
    \ and it was all hands on deck to make sure the\n   transition went smoothly to\
    \ minimize the impact on document\n   processing.\n   Our focus during transition\
    \ was to 1) keep the trains running; that\n   is, we wanted to get ourselves up\
    \ and running with minimal down time,\n   and 2) work with the Transitional RSE\
    \ (a role that concluded before\n   the transition ended), the ISE (Nevil Brownlee),\
    \ RSAG, and the IETF\n   Administrative Director (IAD) to better understand and\
    \ implement the\n   newly defined RFC Editor model.\n   Though some portions of\
    \ the transition were challenging and lasted\n   longer than expected, the Acting\
    \ RSE (Olaf Kolkman) officially handed\n   the reins over to the new RSE (Heather\
    \ Flanagan) in 2012.  She had to\n   jump in, learn the RFC Editor and IETF culture,\
    \ and work through a\n   backlog of issues that had been left unattended.\n  \
    \ Two of the backlogged issues were so old that they were ones someone\n   had\
    \ asked me about at my first IETF meeting: When was the RFC Editor\n   going to\
    \ allow non-ASCII characters in RFCs?  When would the RFC\n   Editor adopt a more\
    \ modern publication format?\n   At that time, while we understood the desire\
    \ to move toward\n   supporting a broader range of character sets and having more-modern\n\
    \   outputs, we also routinely received emails from individuals\n   requesting\
    \ that we send them plaintext files (instead of pointing\n   them to the website)\
    \ because their Internet access was limited.  We\n   also regularly received complaints\
    \ from users of <https://www.rfc-\n   editor.org> whenever something on the site\
    \ didn't work correctly with\n   their older browsers.  In short, we could not\
    \ advance without leaving\n   a large number of users behind.\n   However, we\
    \ now find ourselves on the precipice of change.  The next\n   few years promise\
    \ to be exciting for the RFC Series as we transition\n   from publishing plaintext,\
    \ ASCII-only files to publishing multiple\n   file formats (XML, HTML, PDF/A-3,\
    \ and TXT) that allow both non-ASCII\n   characters and SVG art.\n   Interestingly\
    \ enough, I find that the RFC Editor has been in an\n   almost constant state\
    \ of change since I joined the team, even though\n   the goal of the RFC Editor\
    \ remains the same: to produce archival\n   quality RFCs in a timely manner that\
    \ are easily accessible for future\n   generations.\n"

  contents:
  - "4.  The Next Fifty Years of RFCs\n   As Steve Crocker mentioned, the Series began\
    \ with goals of\n   communication over formality and openness over structure.\
    \  As the\n   Internet has grown and become a pervasive, global construct, we\
    \ still\n   aim for openness and communication, but recognize that for protocols\n\
    \   and other information to support interoperability, there must be\n   points\
    \ of stability to build from.  Everyone, from small-time app\n   developers to\
    \ multi-billion dollar companies, is on the same footing.\n   Anyone should be\
    \ able to look back at a point in time and understand\n   what was done and why.\n\
    \   While the informality has given way to increased structure, the\n   openness\
    \ and solid foundation that the Series provides must continue.\n   With that in\
    \ mind, what does the future hold for the next fifty years\n   of RFCs?\n"
- title: 4.1.  Preservation
  contents:
  - "4.1.  Preservation\n   The RFC Editor exists to edit, publish, and maintain an\
    \ archive of\n   documents published in the RFC Series.  A proper digital archive,\n\
    \   however, is more than just saving RFCs to disk and making sure the\n   disks\
    \ are backed up; the field of digital preservation has grown and\n   transformed\
    \ into an industry in and of itself.  \"Digital Preservation\n   Considerations\
    \ for the RFC Series\" [RFC8153] reviews what a digital\n   archive means today\
    \ and describes ways to support the archive into\n   the future.  It also recommends\
    \ ways for the RFC Editor to take\n   advantage of those organizations that specialize\
    \ in this field.\n   The future of digital preservation, as far as the RFC Series\
    \ is\n   concerned, will mean both finding new partners that can absorb and\n\
    \   archive RFCs into a public, maintained digital archive and reviewing\n   the\
    \ RFC format to ensure that the published documents are archivable\n   according\
    \ to whatever the industry best practice is over time.\n"
- title: 4.2.  Evolution of the RFC Format
  contents:
  - "4.2.  Evolution of the RFC Format\n   RFCs have been digital documents since\
    \ very early in the days of the\n   Series.  While not always published in US-ASCII,\
    \ that format has been\n   the canonical format for decades.  The fact that this\
    \ format has\n   lasted through so much evolution and change is remarkable.\n\
    \   Unfortunately, the US-ASCII format does not extend enough to meet the\n  \
    \ expectations and requirements of many users today.  The entire field\n   of\
    \ online document presentation, consumption, and preservation has,\n   in some\
    \ cases, only been invented years after the first RFC was\n   published.  While\
    \ it can be (and has been) argued that those newer\n   fields and their tools\
    \ have not had a chance to stand the test of\n   time, the RFC Series Editor (in\
    \ consultation with the community)\n   started a concerted effort in 2012 to bring\
    \ the RFC Series into\n   alignment with a new array of possibilities for preservation\
    \ and\n   display.\n   Information on the RFC format project and the initial reasoning\
    \ and\n   requirements for the changes underway can be found in [RFC7990].\n \
    \  With the advent of these changes, the door has been opened to\n   consider\
    \ further changes in the future as the specifications for\n   archiving digital\
    \ material evolves, and as the expectation of web\n   development advances.\n"
- title: 4.3.  Stream Structure
  contents:
  - "4.3.  Stream Structure\n   In the eyes of many, particularly within the IETF,\
    \ the RFC Series is\n   synonymous with the IETF.  While the Series itself predates\
    \ the IETF\n   by eighteen years, over time, the IETF has become the source of\
    \ the\n   majority of documents submitted for publication to the RFC Editor.\n\
    \   The policies developed for IETF Stream drafts tend to apply across\n   all\
    \ four document streams, and publication-related tools tend to\n   focus on the\
    \ IETF as the primary audience for their use.  It is\n   difficult for people\
    \ to see how, or even why, there is a distinction\n   between the Series and the\
    \ IETF.\n   We are in the midst of that question now more than ever.  What is\
    \ the\n   future of the Series?  If people cannot tell where the IETF ends and\n\
    \   the Series starts, should we consider this an artificial distinction\n   and\
    \ declare them to be the same entity?\n   Ultimately, this will be something the\
    \ community decides, and\n   conversations are underway to consider the ramifications\
    \ of possible\n   changes.\n"
- title: 5.  Conclusion
  contents:
  - "5.  Conclusion\n   As the Internet evolves, expectations and possibilities evolve,\
    \ too.\n   Over the next fifty years, the Series will continue to demonstrate\
    \ a\n   balance between the need to stay true to the original mission of\n   publication\
    \ and preservation, while also staying relevant to the\n   needs of the authors\
    \ and consumers of RFCs.  The tension in balancing\n   those needs rests on the\
    \ RFC Editor and the community to resolve.  We\n   will not run short of challenges.\n"
