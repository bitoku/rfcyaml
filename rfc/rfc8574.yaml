- title: Abstract
  contents:
  - "Abstract\n   A web resource is routinely referenced by means of the URI with\
    \ which\n   it is directly accessed.  But cases exist where referencing a\n  \
    \ resource by means of a different URI is preferred.  This\n   specification defines\
    \ a link relation type that can be used to convey\n   such a preference.\n"

  - "1.  Introduction\n   A web resource is routinely referenced (e.g., linked or\
    \ bookmarked)\n   by means of the URI with which it is directly accessed.  But\
    \ cases\n   exist where referencing a resource by means of a different URI is\n\
    \   preferred, for example, because the latter URI is intended to be more\n  \
    \ persistent over time.  Currently, there is no link relation type to\n   convey\
    \ such an alternative referencing preference; this specification\n   addresses\
    \ this deficit by introducing a link relation type intended\n   for that purpose.\n"

  contents:
  - "3.1.  Persistent Identifiers\n   Despite sound advice regarding the design of\
    \ Cool URIs [CoolURIs],\n   link rot (\"HTTP 404 Not Found\") is a common phenomena\
    \ when following\n   links on the Web.  Certain communities of practice (see examples\n\
    \   below) have introduced solutions to combat this problem.  These\n   solutions\
    \ typically consist of:\n   o  Accepting the reality that the web location of\
    \ a resource -- the\n      access URI -- may change over time.\n   o  Minting\
    \ an additional URI for the resource -- the reference URI --\n      that is specifically\
    \ intended to remain persistent over time.\n   o  Redirecting (typically with\
    \ \"HTTP 301 Moved Permanently\", \"HTTP\n      302 Found\", or \"HTTP 303 See\
    \ Other\") from the reference URI to the\n      access URI.\n   o  Committing,\
    \ as a community of practice, to adjust that redirection\n      whenever the access\
    \ URI changes over time.\n   This approach is, for example, used by:\n   o  Scholarly\
    \ publishers that use DOIs (Digital Object Identifiers)\n      [DOIs] to identify\
    \ articles and DOI URLs [DOI-URLs] as a means to\n      keep cross-publisher article-to-article\
    \ links operational, even\n      when the journals in which the articles are published\
    \ change hands\n      from one publisher to another, for example, as a result\
    \ of an\n      acquisition.\n   o  Authors of controlled vocabularies that use\
    \ PURLs (Persistent\n      Uniform Resource Locators) [PURLs] for vocabulary terms\
    \ to ensure\n      that the URIs they assign to vocabulary terms remain stable\
    \ even\n      if management of the vocabulary is transferred to a new custodian.\n\
    \   o  A variety of organizations (including libraries, archives, and\n      museums)\
    \ that assign ARK (Archival Resource Key) URLs [ARK] to\n      information objects\
    \ in order to support long-term access.\n   In order for the investments in infrastructure\
    \ involved in these\n   approaches to pay off, and hence for links to effectively\
    \ remain\n   operational as intended, it is crucial that a resource be referenced\n\
    \   by means of its reference URI.  However, the access URI is where a\n   user\
    \ agent actually accesses the resource (e.g., it is the URI in the\n   browser's\
    \ address bar).  As such, there is a considerable risk that\n   the access URI\
    \ instead of the reference URI is used for referencing\n   [PIDs-must-be-used].\n\
    \   The link relation type defined in this document makes it possible for\n  \
    \ user agents to differentiate the reference URI from the access URI.\n"
- title: 3.2.  Version Identifiers
  contents:
  - "3.2.  Version Identifiers\n   Resource versioning systems often use a naming\
    \ approach whereby:\n   o  The most recent version of a resource is always available\
    \ at the\n      same, generic URI.\n   o  Each version of the resource -- including\
    \ the most recent one --\n      has a distinct version URI.\n   For example, Wikipedia\
    \ uses generic URIs of the form\n   <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Doe> and\
    \ version URIs of the form\n   <https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=John_Doe&oldid=\n\
    \   776253882>.\n   While the current version of a resource is accessed at the\
    \ generic\n   URI, some versioning systems adhere to a policy that favors linking\n\
    \   and referencing a specific version URI.  To express this using the\n   terminology\
    \ of Section 2, these policies intend that the generic URI\n   is the access URI\
    \ and that the version URI is the reference URI.\n   These policies are informed\
    \ by the understanding that the content at\n   the generic URI is likely to evolve\
    \ over time and that accurate links\n   or references should lead to the content\
    \ as it was at the time of\n   referencing.  To that end, Wikipedia's \"Permanent\
    \ link\" and \"Cite\n   this page\" functionalities promote the version URI, not\
    \ the generic\n   URI.\n   The link relation type defined in this document makes\

    \ URI.\n"
- title: 3.3.  Preferred Social Identifier
  contents:
  - "3.3.  Preferred Social Identifier\n   A web user commonly has multiple profiles\
    \ on the Web, for example,\n   one per social network, a personal homepage, a\
    \ professional homepage,\n   a FOAF (Friend Of A Friend) profile [FOAF], etc.\
    \  Each of these\n   profiles is accessible at a distinct URI.  But the user may\
    \ have a\n   preference for one of those profiles, for example, because it is\
    \ most\n   complete, kept up to date, or expected to be long lived.  As an\n \
    \  example, the first author of this document has, among others, the\n   following\
    \ profile URIs:\n   o  <https://hvdsomp.info>\n   o  <https://twitter.com/hvdsomp>\n\
    \   o  <https://www.linkedin.com/in/herbertvandesompel/>\n   o  <https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0715-6126>\n\
    \   Of these, from the perspective of the person described by these\n   profiles,\
    \ the first URI may be the preferred profile URI for the\n   purpose of referencing\
    \ because the domain is not under the\n   custodianship of a third party.  When\
    \ an agent accesses another\n   profile URI, such as <https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0715-6126>,\
    \ this\n   preference for referencing by means of the first URI could be\n   expressed.\n\

    \ profile URI.\n"
- title: 3.4.  Multi-resource Publications
  contents:
  - "3.4.  Multi-resource Publications\n   When publishing on the Web, it is not uncommon\
    \ to make distinct\n   components of a publication available as different web\

    \ publications routinely consists of a\n      traditional article as well as additional\

- title: 4.  The "cite-as" Link Relation Type for Expressing a Preferred URI for
  contents:
  - "4.  The \"cite-as\" Link Relation Type for Expressing a Preferred URI for\n \
    \   the Purpose of Referencing\n   A link with the \"cite-as\" relation type indicates\
    \ that, for\n   referencing the link context, use of the URI of the link target\
    \ is\n   preferred over use of the URI of the link context.  It allows the\n \
    \  resource identified by the access URI (link context) to unambiguously\n   link\
    \ to its corresponding reference URI (link target), thereby\n   expressing that\
    \ the link target is preferred over the link context\n   for the purpose of permanent\
    \ citation.\n   The link target of a \"cite-as\" link SHOULD support protocol-based\n\
    \   access as a means to ensure that applications that store them can\n   effectively\
    \ reuse them for access.\n   The link target of a \"cite-as\" link SHOULD provide\
    \ the ability for a\n   user agent to follow its nose back to the context of the\
    \ link, e.g.,\n   by following redirects and/or links.  This helps a user agent\
    \ to\n   establish trust in the target URI.\n   Because a link with the \"cite-as\"\
    \ relation type expresses a preferred\n   URI for the purpose of referencing,\
    \ the access URI SHOULD only\n   provide one link with that relation type.  If\
    \ more than one \"cite-as\"\n   link is provided, the user agent may decide to\
    \ select one (e.g., an\n   HTTP URI over a mailto URI) based on the purpose that\
    \ the reference\n   URI will serve.\n   Providing a link with the \"cite-as\"\
    \ relation type does not prevent\n   using the access URI for the purpose of referencing\
    \ if such\n   specificity is needed for the application at hand.  For example,\
    \ in\n   the case of the scenario in Section 3.4, the access URI is likely\n \
    \  required for the purpose of annotating a specific component of an\n   intellectual\
    \ publication.  Yet, the annotation application may also\n   want to appropriately\
    \ include the reference URI in the annotation.\n   Applications can leverage the\
    \ information provided by a \"cite-as\"\n   link in a variety of ways, for example:\n\
    \   o  Bookmarking tools and citation managers can take this preference\n    \
    \  into account when recording a URI.\n   o  Webometrics applications that trace\
    \ URIs can trace both the access\n      URI and the reference URI.\n   o  Discovery\
    \ tools can support lookup by means of both the access and\n      the reference\
    \ URI.  This includes web archives that typically make\n      archived versions\
    \ of web resources discoverable by means of the\n      original access URI of\
    \ the archived resource; they can\n      additionally make these archived resources\
    \ discoverable by means\n      of the associated reference URI.\n"
- title: 5.  Distinction with Other Link Relation Types
  contents:
  - "5.  Distinction with Other Link Relation Types\n   Some existing IANA-registered\
    \ relationships intuitively resemble the\n   relationship that \"cite-as\" is\
    \ intended to convey.  But a closer\n   inspection of these candidates provided\
    \ in the blog posts\n   [identifier-blog], [canonical-blog], and [bookmark-blog]\
    \ shows that\n   they are not appropriate for various reasons and that a new link\n\
    \   relation type is required.  The remainder of this section provides a\n   summary\
    \ of the detailed explanations provided in the referenced blog\n   posts.\n  \
    \ It can readily be seen that the following link relation types do not\n   address\
    \ the requirements described in Section 3:\n   o  \"alternate\" [RFC4287]: The\
    \ link target provides an alternate\n      version of the content at the link\
    \ context.  These are typically\n      variants according to dimensions that are\
    \ subject to content\n      negotiation, for example, the same content with varying\
    \ Content-\n      Type (e.g., application/pdf vs. text/html) and/or Content-Language\n\
    \      (e.g., en vs. fr).  The representations provided by the context\n     \
    \ URIs and target URIs in the scenarios in Sections 3.1 through 3.4\n      are\
    \ not variants in the sense intended by [RFC4287], and, as such,\n      the use\
    \ of \"alternate\" is not appropriate.\n   o  \"duplicate\" [RFC6249]: The link\
    \ target is a resource whose\n      available representations are byte-for-byte\
    \ identical with the\n      corresponding representations of the link context,\
    \ for example, an\n      identical file on a mirror site.  In none of the scenarios\n\
    \      described in Sections 3.1 through 3.4 do the link context and the\n   \
    \   link target provide identical content.  As such, the use of\n      \"duplicate\"\
    \ is not appropriate.\n   o  \"related\" [RFC4287]: The link target is a resource\
    \ that is related\n      to the link context.  While \"related\" could be used\
    \ in all of the\n      scenarios described in Sections 3.1 through 3.4, its semantics\
    \ are\n      too vague to convey the specific semantics intended by \"cite-as\"\
    .\n   Two existing IANA-registered relationships deserve closer attention\n  \
    \ and are discussed in the remainder of this section.\n"
- title: 5.1.  The "bookmark" Link Relation Type
  contents:
  - "5.1.  The \"bookmark\" Link Relation Type\n   \"bookmark\" [W3C.REC-html52-20171214]:\
    \ The link target provides a URI\n   for the purpose of bookmarking the link context.\n\
    \   The intent of \"bookmark\" is closest to that of \"cite-as\" in that the\n\
    \   link target is intended to be a permalink for the link context, for\n   bookmarking\
    \ purposes.  The link relation type dates back to the\n   earliest days of news\
    \ syndication, before blogs and news feeds had\n   permalinks to identify individual\
    \ resources that were aggregated into\n   a single page.  As such, its intent\

- title: 5.2.  The "canonical" Link Relation Type
  contents:
  - "5.2.  The \"canonical\" Link Relation Type\n   \"canonical\" [RFC6596]: The meaning\
    \ of \"canonical\" is commonly\n   misunderstood on the basis of its brief definition\
    \ as being \"the\n   preferred version of a resource.\"  The description in the\
    \ abstract of\n   [RFC6596] is more helpful and states that \"canonical\" is intended\
    \ to\n   link to a resource that is preferred over resources with duplicative\n\
    \   content.  A more detailed reading of [RFC6596] clarifies that the\n   intended\
    \ meaning is that \"canonical\" is preferred for the purpose of\n   content indexing.\
    \  A typical use case is linking from each page in a\n   multi-page magazine article\
    \ to a single page version of the article\n   provided for indexing by search\
    \ engines: the former pages provide\n   content that is duplicative to the superset\
    \ content that is available\n   at the latter page.\n   The semantics intended\
    \ by \"canonical\" as preferred for the purpose of\n   content indexing differ\
    \ from the semantics intended by \"cite-as\" as\n   preferred for the purpose\
    \ of referencing.  A further exploration of\n   the various scenarios shows that\
    \ the use of \"canonical\" is not\n   appropriate to convey the semantics intended\
    \ by \"cite-as\":\n   o  Scenario of Section 3.1: The reference URI that is intended\
    \ to be\n      persistent over time does not serve content that needs to be\n\
    \      indexed; it merely redirects to the access URI.  Since the meaning\n  \
    \    intended by \"canonical\" is that it is preferred for the purpose of\n  \
    \    content indexing, it is not appropriate to point at the reference\n     \
    \ URI (persistent identifier) using the \"canonical\" link relation\n      type.\
    \  Moreover, Section 6.1 shows that scholarly publishers that\n      assign persistent\
    \ identifiers already use the \"canonical\" link\n      relation type for search\
    \ engine optimization; it also shows how\n      that use contrasts with the intended\
    \ use of \"cite-as\".\n   o  Scenario of Section 3.2: In most common cases, custodians\
    \ of\n      resource versioning systems want search engines to index the most\n\
    \      recent version of a page and hence would use a \"canonical\" link to\n\
    \      point from version URIs of a resource to the associated generic\n     \
    \ URI.  Wikipedia effectively does this.  However, for some resource\n      versioning\
    \ systems, including Wikipedia, version URIs are\n      preferred for the purpose\
    \ of referencing.  As such, a \"cite-as\"\n      link would point from the generic\
    \ URI to the most recent version\n      URI (that is, in the opposite direction\
    \ of the \"canonical\" link).\n   o  Scenario of Section 3.3: The content at the\
    \ link target and the\n      link context are different profiles for a same person.\
    \  Each\n      profile, not just a preferred one, should be indexed.  But a\n\
    \      single one could be preferred for referencing.\n   o  Scenario of Section\
    \ 3.4: The content at the link target, if any,\n      would typically be a landing\
    \ page that includes descriptive\n      metadata pertaining to the multi-resource\
    \ publication and links to\n      its component resources.  Each component resource\
    \ provides content\n      that is different, not duplicative, to the landing page.\n\
    \   A more detailed justification regarding how the use of \"canonical\" is\n\
    \   inappropriate to address the requirements described in this document,\n  \
    \ including examples, is provided in [canonical-blog].\n"

- title: 6.1.  Persistent HTTP URI
  contents:
  - "6.1.  Persistent HTTP URI\n   PLOS ONE is one of many scholarly publishers that\
    \ assigns DOIs to the\n   articles it publishes.  For example, <https://doi.org/10.1371/\n\
    \   journal.pone.0171057> is the persistent identifier for such an\n   article.\
    \  Via the DOI resolver, this persistent identifier redirects\n   to <https://journals.plos.org/plosone/doi?id=10.1371/\n\
    \   journal.pone.0171057> in the plos.org domain.  This URI itself\n   redirects\
    \ to <https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/\n   journal.pone.0171057>,\
    \ which delivers the actual article in HTML.\n   The HTML article contains a <link>\
    \ element with the \"canonical\" link\n   relation type pointing at itself, <https://journals.plos.org/plosone/\n\
    \   article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0167475>.  As per Section 5.2, this\n   indicates\
    \ that the article content at that URI should be indexed by\n   search engines.\n\
    \   PLOS ONE can additionally provide a link with the \"cite-as\" relation\n \
    \  type pointing at the persistent identifier to indicate it is the\n   preferred\
    \ URI for permanent citation of the article.  Figure 1 shows\n   the addition\
    \ of the \"cite-as\" link in both the HTTP header and the\n   HTML that results\

- title: 6.2.  Version URIs
  contents:
  - "6.2.  Version URIs\n   The preprint server arXiv.org has a versioning approach\
    \ like the one\n   described in Section 3.2:\n   o  The most recent version of\
    \ a preprint is always available at the\n      same, generic URI.  Consider the\
    \ preprint with generic URI\n      <https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.03787>.\n   o \
    \ Each version of the preprint -- including the most recent one --\n      has\
    \ a distinct version URI.  The considered preprint has two\n      versions with\
    \ respective version URIs: <https://arxiv.org/\n      abs/1711.03787v1> (published\
    \ 10 November 2017) and\n      <https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.03787v2> (published\

    \ between 10\n   November 2017 and 23 January 2018, obtained the first version\
    \ of the\n   preprint.  Starting 24 January 2018, the second version was served\
    \ at\n   that URI.  In order to support accurate referencing, arXiv.org could\n\
    \   implement the \"cite-as\" link to point from the generic URI to the\n   most\
    \ recent version URI.  In doing so, assuming the existence of\n   reference manager\
    \ tools that consume \"cite-as\" links:\n   o  The reader who accesses <https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.03787>\
    \ between\n      10 November 2017 and 23 January 2018 would reference\n      <https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.03787v1>.\n\
