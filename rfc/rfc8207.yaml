- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   Origin validation based on the Resource Public Key Infrastructure\n\
    \   (RPKI) [RFC6811] is in its early phases.  As BGPsec [RFC8205] may\n   require\
    \ larger memory and/or more modern CPUs, it expected to be\n   deployed incrementally\
    \ over a longer time span.  BGPsec is a new\n   protocol with many operational\
    \ considerations that this document\n   attempts to describe.  As with most operational\
    \ practices, they will\n   likely change over time.\n   BGPsec relies on widespread\
    \ propagation of the RPKI [RFC6480].  How\n   the RPKI is distributed and maintained\
    \ globally and within an\n   operator's infrastructure may be different for BGPsec\
    \ than for origin\n   validation.\n   BGPsec needs to be spoken only by an Autonomous\
    \ System's (AS's)\n   eBGP-speaking border routers.  It is designed so that it\
    \ can be used\n   to protect announcements that are originated by resource-constrained\n\
    \   edge routers.  This has special operational considerations, see\n   Section\
    \ 6.\n   Different prefixes may have different timing and replay protection\n\
    \   considerations.\n"

- title: 4.  AS/Router Certificates
  contents:
  - "4.  AS/Router Certificates\n   As described in [KEY], BGPsec-speaking routers\
    \ are capable of\n   generating their own public/private key-pairs and having\
    \ their\n   certificates signed and published in the RPKI by the RPKI\n   Certification\
    \ Authority (CA) system, and/or are given public/private\n   key-pairs by the\
    \ operator.\n   A site/operator may use a single certificate/key in all their\n\
    \   routers, one certificate/key per router, or any granularity in\n   between.\n\
    \   A large operator, concerned that a compromise of one router's key\n   would\
    \ make other routers vulnerable, may deploy a more complex\n   certificate/key\
    \ distribution burden to reduce this exposure.\n   At the other end of the spectrum,\
    \ an edge site with one or two\n   routers may choose to use a single certificate/key.\n\
    \   In anticipation of possible key compromise, a prudent operator SHOULD\n  \
    \ pre-provision each router's 'next' key in the RPKI so that there is\n   no propagation\
    \ delay for provisioning the new key.\n"
- title: 5.  Within a Network
  contents:
  - "5.  Within a Network\n   BGPsec is spoken by edge routers in a network, specifically\
    \ those\n   that border other networks/ASes.\n   In an AS where edge routers speak\
    \ BGPsec and, therefore, inject\n   BGPsec paths into the iBGP (internal BGP),\
    \ Route Reflectors (RRs)\n   MUST have BGPsec enabled if and only if there are\
    \ eBGP (external BGP)\n   speakers in their client cone, i.e., an RR client or\
    \ the transitive\n   closure of a client's customers.\n   A BGPsec-capable router\
    \ MAY use the data it receives to influence\n   local policy within its network,\
    \ see Section 7.  In deployment, this\n   policy should fit into the AS's existing\
    \ policy, preferences, etc.\n   This allows a network to incrementally deploy\
    \ BGPsec-enabled border\n   routers.\n   eBGP speakers that face more critical\
    \ peers or upstreams or\n   downstreams would be candidates for early deployment.\
    \  Both securing\n   one's own announcements and validating received announcements\
    \ should\n   be considered in partial deployment.\n   An operator should be aware\
    \ that BGPsec, as any other policy change,\n   can cause traffic shifts in their\
    \ network.  And, as with normal\n   policy shift practice, a prudent operator\
    \ has the tools and methods\n   to predict, measure, modify, etc.\n   On the other\
    \ hand, an operator wanting to monitor router loading,\n   shifts in traffic,\
    \ etc., might deploy incrementally while watching\n   those and similar effects.\n\
    \   BGPsec does not sign over communities, so they are not formally\n   trustable.\
    \  Additionally, outsourcing verification is not a prudent\n   security practice.\
    \  Therefore, an eBGP listener SHOULD NOT strongly\n   trust unsigned security\
    \ signaling, such as communities, received\n   across a trust boundary.\n"
- title: 6.  Considerations for Edge Sites
  contents:
  - "6.  Considerations for Edge Sites\n   An edge site that does not provide transit\
    \ and trusts its upstream(s)\n   may only originate a signed prefix announcement\
    \ and not validate\n   received announcements.\n   An operator might need to use\
    \ hardware with limited resources.  In\n   such cases, BGPsec protocol capability\
    \ negotiation allows for a\n   resource-constrained edge router to hold only its\
    \ own signing key(s)\n   and sign its announcements, but not receive signed announcements.\n\
    \   Therefore, the router would not have to deal with the majority of the\n  \
    \ RPKI, potentially saving the need for additional hardware.\n   As the vast majority\
    \ of ASes are stubs, and they announce the\n   majority of prefixes, this allows\
    \ for simpler and less expensive\n   incremental deployment.  It may also mean\
    \ that edge sites concerned\n   with routing security will be attracted to upstreams\
    \ that support\n   BGPsec.\n"
- title: 7.  Routing Policy
  contents:
  - "7.  Routing Policy\n   As BGPsec-signed paths cannot traverse non-BGPsec topology,\
    \ partial\n   BGPsec deployment forms islands of assured paths.  As islands grow\
    \ to\n   touch each other, they become larger islands.\n   Unlike origin validation\
    \ based on the RPKI, BGPsec marks a received\n   announcement as Valid or Not\
    \ Valid, there is no explicit NotFound\n   state.  In some sense, an unsigned\
    \ BGP4 path is the equivalent of\n   NotFound.  How this is used in routing is\
    \ up to the operator's local\n   policy, similar to origin validation as in [RFC6811].\n\
    \   As BGPsec will be rolled out over years and does not allow for\n   intermediate\
    \ non-signing edge routers, coverage will be spotty for a\n   long time.  This\
    \ presents a dilemma; should a router evaluating an\n   inbound BGPsec_PATH as\
    \ Not Valid be very strict and discard it?  On\n   the other hand, it might be\
    \ the only path to that prefix, and a very\n   low local-preference would cause\
    \ it to be used and propagated only if\n   there was no alternative.  Either choice\
    \ is reasonable, but we\n   recommend dropping because of the next point.\n  \
    \ Operators should be aware that accepting Not Valid announcements, no\n   matter\
    \ the local preference, will often be the equivalent of treating\n   them as fully\
    \ Valid.  Local preference affects only routes to the\n   same set of destinations.\
    \  Consider having a Valid announcement from\n   neighbor V for prefix 10.0.0.0/16\
    \ and a Not Valid announcement for\n   10.0.666.0/24 from neighbor I.  If local\
    \ policy on the router is not\n   configured to discard the Not Valid announcement\
    \ from I, then the\n   longest match forwarding will send packets to neighbor\
    \ I no matter\n   the value of local preference.\n   Validation of signed paths\
    \ is usually deployed at the eBGP edge.\n   Local policy on the eBGP edge MAY\
    \ convey the validation state of a\n   BGP-signed path through normal local policy\
    \ mechanisms, e.g., setting\n   a BGP community for internal use, or modifying\
    \ a metric value such as\n   local-preference or Multi-Exit Discriminator (MED).\
    \  Some may choose\n   to use the large Local-Pref hammer.  Others may choose\
    \ to let AS path\n   rule and set their internal metric, which comes after AS\
    \ path in the\n   BGP decision process.\n   As the mildly stochastic timing of\
    \ RPKI propagation may cause version\n   skew across routers, an AS Path that\
    \ does not validate at router R0\n   might validate at R1.  Therefore, signed\
    \ paths that are Not Valid and\n   yet propagated (because they are chosen as\
    \ best path) MUST NOT have\n   signatures stripped and MUST be signed if sent\
    \ to external BGPsec\n   speakers.\n   This implies that updates which a speaker\
    \ judges to be Not Valid MAY\n   be propagated to iBGP peers.  Therefore, unless\
    \ local policy ensures\n   otherwise, a signed path learned via iBGP may be Not\
    \ Valid.  If\n   needed, the validation state should be signaled by normal local\n\
    \   policy mechanisms such as communities or metrics.\n   On the other hand, local\
    \ policy on the eBGP edge might preclude iBGP\n   or eBGP announcement of signed\
    \ AS Paths that are Not Valid.\n   A BGPsec speaker receiving a path SHOULD perform\
    \ origin validation\n   per [RFC6811] and [RFC7115].\n   A route server is usually\
    \ 'transparent', i.e., does not insert an AS\n   into the path so as not to increase\
    \ the AS hop count, and thereby\n   affect downstream path choices.  But, with\
    \ BGPsec, a client router R\n   needs to be able to validate paths that are forward\
    \ signed to R.  But\n   the sending router cannot generate signatures to all the\
    \ possible\n   clients.  Therefore, a BGPsec-aware route server needs to validate\n\
    \   the incoming BGPsec_PATH and to forward updates that can be validated\n  \
    \ by clients that must, therefore, know the route server's AS.  This\n   implies\
    \ that the route server creates signatures per client including\n   its own AS\
    \ in the BGPsec_PATH, forward signing to each client AS, see\n   [RFC8205].  The\
    \ route server uses a pCount of 0 to not increase the\n   effective AS hop count,\
    \ thereby retaining the intent of\n   'transparency'.\n   If it is known that\
    \ a BGPsec neighbor is a transparent route server,\n   or otherwise may validly\
    \ use a pCount of 0 (e.g., see [RFC8206]), the\n   router SHOULD be configured\
    \ to accept and process a received pCount\n   of 0.  Routers MUST disallow a pCount\
    \ of 0 by default.\n   To prevent exposure of the internals of the BGP confederations\n\
    \   [RFC5065], a BGPsec speaker exporting to a non-member removes all\n   intra-confederation\
    \ Secure_Path Segments.  Therefore, signing within\n   the confederation will\
    \ not cause external confusion even if non-\n   unique private ASes are used.\n"
- title: 8.  Notes
  contents:
  - "8.  Notes\n   For protection from attacks replaying BGP data on the order of\
    \ a day\n   or longer old, rekeying routers with new keys (previously)\n   provisioned\
    \ in the RPKI is sufficient.  For one approach, see\n   [ROLLOVER].\n   A router\
    \ that once negotiated (and/or sent) BGPsec should not be\n   expected to always\
    \ do so.\n   Like the DNS, the Global RPKI presents only a loosely consistent\n\
    \   view, depending on timing, updating, fetching, etc.  Thus, one cache\n   or\
    \ router may have different data about a particular prefix or router\n   than\
    \ another cache or router.  There is no 'fix' for this, it is the\n   nature of\
    \ distributed data with distributed caches.\n   Operators who manage certificates\
    \ SHOULD have RPKI Ghostbuster\n   Records (see [RFC6493]), signed indirectly\
    \ by end entity\n   certificates, for those certificates on which others' routing\
    \ depends\n   for certificate and/or ROA validation.\n   Operators should be aware\
    \ of impending algorithm transitions, which\n   will be rare and slow-paced, see\
    \ [RFC6916].  They should work with\n   their vendors to ensure support for new\
    \ algorithms.\n   As a router must evaluate certificates and ROAs that are time\n\
    \   dependent, routers' clocks MUST be correct to a tolerance of\n   approximately\
    \ an hour.  The common approach is for operators to\n   deploy servers that provide\
    \ time service, such as [RFC5905], to\n   client routers.\n   If a router has\
    \ reason to believe its clock is seriously incorrect,\n   e.g., it has a time\
    \ earlier than 2011, it SHOULD NOT attempt to\n   validate incoming updates. \
    \ It SHOULD defer validation until it\n   believes it is within reasonable time\
    \ tolerance.\n"
