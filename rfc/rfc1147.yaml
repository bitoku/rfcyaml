    \   Request for Comments: 1147                   SPARTA, Inc.\n          FYI:\
    \ 2                                         April 1990\n                   FYI\
    \ on a Network Management Tool Catalog:\n              Tools for Monitoring and\
    \ Debugging TCP/IP Internets\n                           and Interconnected Devices\n\
    \          Status of this Memo\n          The goal of this FYI memo is to provide\
    \ practical informa-\n          tion to site administrators and network managers.\
    \  This memo\n          provides information for the Internet community.  It does\n\
    \          not specify any standard.  It is not a statement of IAB pol-\n    \
    \      icy or recommendations.  Comments, critiques, and new or\n          updated\
    \ tool descriptions are welcome, and should be sent to\n          Robert Stine,\
    \ at stine@sparta.com, or to the NOCTools work-\n          ing group, at noctools@merit.edu.\n\
    \          Distribution of this memo is unlimited.\n          1. Introduction\n\
    \          This catalog contains descriptions of several tools avail-\n      \
    \    able to assist network managers in debugging and maintaining\n          TCP/IP\
    \ internets and interconnected communications\n          resources.  Entries in\
    \ the catalog tell what a tool does,\n          how it works, and how it can be\
    \ obtained.\n          The NOCTools Working Group of the Internet Engineering\
    \ Task\n          Force (IETF) compiled this catalog in 1989.  Future editions\n\
    \          will be produced as IETF members become aware of tools that\n     \
    \     should be included, and of deficiencies or inaccuracies.\n          Developing\
    \ an edition oriented to the OSI protocol suite is\n          also contemplated.\n\
    \          The tools described in this catalog are in no way endorsed\n      \
    \    by the IETF.  For the most part, we have neither evaluated\n          the\
    \ tools in this catalog, nor validated their descriptions.\n          Most of\
    \ the descriptions of commercial tools have been pro-\n          vided by vendors.\
    \  Caveat Emptor.\n          1.1 Purpose\n          The practice of re-inventing\
    \ the wheel seems endemic to the\n          field of data communications.  The\
    \ primary goal of this\n          document is to fight that tendency in a small\
    \ but useful\n          way.  By listing the capabilities of some of the available\n\
    \          network management tools, we hope to pool and share\n          knowledge\
    \ and experience.  Another goal of this catalog is\n          to show those new\
    \ in the field what can be done to manage\n          internet sites.  A network\
    \ management tutorial at the end of\n          the document is of further assistance\
    \ in this area.\n          Finally, by omission, this catalog points out the network\n\
    \          management tools that are needed, but do not yet exist.\n         \
    \ There are other sources of information on available network\n          management\
    \ tools.  Both the DDN Protocol Implementation and\n          Vendors Guide and\
    \ the DATAPRO series on data communications\n          and LANs are particularly\
    \ comprehensive and informative.\n          The DDN Protocol Implementation and\
    \ Vendors Guide addresses\n          a wide range of internet management topics,\
    \ including\n          evaluations of protocol implementations and network\n \
    \         analyzers.* The DATAPRO volumes, though expensive (check\n         \
    \ your local university or technical libraries!), are good\n          surveys\
    \ of available commercial products for network manage-\n          ment.  DATAPRO\
    \ also includes tutorials, market analyses,\n          product evaluations, and\
    \ predictions on technology trends.\n          1.2 Scope\n          The tools\
    \ described in this document are used for managing\n          the network resources,\
    \ LANs, and devices that are commonly\n          interconnected by TCP/IP internets.\
    \  This document is not,\n          however, a \"how to\" manual on network management.\
    \  While it\n          includes a tutorial, the coverage is much too brief and\
    \ gen-\n          eral to serve as a sole source: a great deal of further\n  \
    \        study is required of aspiring network managers.  Neither is\n       \
    \   this catalog is an operations manual for particular tools.\n          Each\
    \ individual tool entry is brief, and emphasizes the uses\n          to which\
    \ a tool can be put.  A tool's documentation, which\n          in some cases runs\
    \ to hundreds of pages, should be consulted\n          for assistance in its installation\
    \ and operation.\n          1.3 Overview\n          Section 1 describes the purpose,\
    \ scope, and organization of\n          this catalog.\n          Section 2 lists\
    \ and explains the standard keywords used in\n          _________________________\n\
    \          * Instructions for obtaining the DDN Protocol Guide are\n         \
    \ given in Section 7 of the appendix.\n          the tool descriptions.  The keywords\
    \ can be used as a sub-\n          ject index into the catalog.\n          Section\
    \ 3, the main body of the catalog, contains the\n          entries describing\
    \ network management tools.  The tool\n          entries in Section 3 are presented\
    \ in alphabetical order, by\n          tool name.  The tool descriptions all follow\
    \ a standard for-\n          mat, described in the introduction to Section 3.\n\
    \          Following the catalog, there is an appendix that contains a\n     \
    \     tutorial on the goals and practice of network management.\n          1.4\
    \ Acknowledgements\n          The compilation and editing of this catalog was\
    \ sponsored by\n          the Defense Communications Engineering Center (DCEC),\
    \ con-\n          tract DCA100-89-C-0001.  The effort grew out of an initial\n\
    \          task to survey current internet management tools.  The cata-\n    \
    \      log is largely, however, the result of volunteer labor on\n          the\
    \ part of the NOCTools Working Group, the User Services\n          Working Group,\
    \ and many others.  Without these volunteer\n          contributions, the catalog\
    \ would not exist.  The support\n          from the Internet community for this\
    \ endeavor has been\n          extremely gratifying.\n          Several individuals\
    \ made especially notable contributions.\n          Mike Patton, Paul Holbrook,\
    \ Mark Fedor and Gary Malkin were\n          particularly helpful in composition\
    \ and editorial review,\n          while Dave Crocker provided essential guidance\
    \ and\n          encouragement.  Bob Enger was active from the first with the\n\
    \          gut work of chairing the Working Group and building the\n         \
    \ catalog.  Phill Gross helped to christen the NOCTools Work-\n          ing Group,\
    \ to define its scope and goals, and to establish\n          its role in the IETF.\
    \  Mike Little contributed the formative\n          idea of enhancing and publicizing\
    \ the management tool survey\n          through IETF participation.\n        \
    \  Responsibility for any deficiencies and errors remains, of\n          course,\
    \ with the editor.\n          2. Keywords\n          This catalog uses \"keywords\"\
    \ for terse characterizations of\n          the tools.  Keywords are abbreviated\
    \ attributes of a tool or\n          its use.  To allow cross-comparison of tools,\
    \ uniform key-\n          word definitions have been developed, and are given\
    \ below.\n          Following the definitions, there is an index of catalog\n\
    \          entries by keyword.\n          2.1 Keyword Definitions\n          The\
    \ keywords are always listed in a prefined order, sorted\n          first by the\
    \ general category into which they fall, and then\n          alphabetically. \
    \ The categories that have been defined for\n          management tool keywords\
    \ are:\n               o\b+    the general management area to which a tool\n \
    \                   relates or a tool's functional role;\n               o\b+\
    \    the network resources or components that are\n                    managed;\n\
    \               o\b+    the mechanisms or methods a tool uses to perform\n   \
    \                 its functions;\n               o\b+    the operating system\
    \ and hardware environment of a\n                    tool; and\n             \
    \  o\b+    the characteristics of a tool as a hardware pro-\n                \
    \    duct or software release.\n          The keywords used to describe the general\
    \ management area or\n          functional role of a tool are:\n          Alarm\n\

    \          Following is an index of catalog entries sorted by keyword.\n     \
    \     This index can be used to locate the tools with a particular\n         \
    \ attribute: tools are listed under each keyword that charac-\n          terizes\
    \ them.  The keywords and the subordinate lists of\n          tools under them\
    \ are in alphabetical order.\n          In the interest of brevity, some liberties\
    \ have been taken\n          with tool names.  Capitalization of the names is\
    \ as speci-\n          fied by the tool developers or distributers.  Note that\n\
    \          parenthetical roman numerals following a tool's name are not\n    \
    \      actually part of the name.  The use of roman numerals to\n          differentiate\
    \ tools with the same name is explained in the\n          introduction of Section\

    \ a collection of brief descriptions of tools\n          for managing TCP/IP internets.\
    \  These entries are in alpha-\n          betical order, by tool name.\n     \
    \     The entries all follow a standard format.  Immediately after\n         \
    \ the NAME of a tool are its associated KEYWORDS.  Keywords\n          are terse\
    \ descriptions of the purposes or attributes of a\n          tool.  A more detailed\
    \ description of a tool's purpose and\n          characteristics is given in the\
    \ ABSTRACT section.  The\n          MECHANISM section describes how a tool works.\
    \  In CAVEATS,\n          warnings about tool use are given.  In BUGS, known bugs\
    \ or\n          bug-report procedures are given.  LIMITATIONS describes the\n\
    \          boundaries of a tool's capabilities.  HARDWARE REQUIRED and\n     \
    \     SOFTWARE REQUIRED relate the operational environment a tool\n          needs.\
    \  Finally, in AVAILABILITY, pointers to vendors,\n          online repositories,\
    \ or other sources for a tool are given.\n          We deal with the problem of\
    \ tool-name clashes -- different\n          tools that have the same name -- by\
    \ appending parenthetical\n          roman numerals to the names.  For example,\
    \ BYU, MITRE, and\n          SNMP Research each submitted a description of a tool\
    \ called\n          \"NETMON.\" These tools were independently developed, are\n\
    \          functionally different, run in different environments, and\n      \
    \    are no more related than Richard Burton the 19th century\n          explorer\
    \ and Richard Burton the 20th century actor.  BYU's\n          tool \"NETMON\"\
    \ is listed as \"NETMON (I),\" MITRE's as \"NETMON\n          (II),\" and the\
    \ tool from SNMP Research as \"NETMON (III).\"\n          The parenthetical roman\
    \ numerals reveal only the order in\n          which the catalog editor received\
    \ the tool descriptions.\n          They should not be construed to indicate any\
    \ sort of prefer-\n          ence, priority, or rights to a tool name.\n     \

    \   ABSTRACT\n               The CMU SNMP Distribution includes source code for\
    \ an\n               SNMP agent, several SNMP client applications, an ASN.1\n\
    \               library, and supporting documentation.\n               The agent\
    \ compiles into about 10 KB of 68000 code.  The\n               distribution includes\
    \ a full agent that runs on a\n               Kinetics FastPath2/3/4, and is built\
    \ into the KIP\n               appletalk/ethernet gateway.  The machine independent\n\
    \               portions of this agent also run on CMU's IBM PC/AT\n         \
    \      based router.\n               The applications are designed to be useful\
    \ in the real\n               world.  Information is collected and presented in\
    \ a\n               useful format and is suitable for everyday status moni-\n\
    \               toring.  Input and output are interpreted symbolically.\n    \
    \           The tools can be used without referencing the RFCs.\n          MECHANISM\n\

    \ with efficiency and portability in\n               mind.  The applications compile\
    \ and run on the follow-\n               ing systems: IBM PC/RT running ACIS Release\
    \ 3, Sun3/50\n               running SUNOS 3.5, and the DEC microVax running Ultrix\n\
    \               2.2.  They are expected to run on any system with a\n        \
    \       Berkeley socket interface.\n          AVAILABILITY\n               This\

    \ 858 computer security ques-\n               tions divided up in thirteen sections.\
    \  The program\n               presents the questions to the user and records\
    \ their\n               responses.  After answering the questions in one of the\n\
    \               thirteen sections, the user can generate a report from\n     \
    \          the questions and the user's answers.  The thirteen\n             \
    \  sections are: telecommunications security, physical\n               access\
    \ security, personnel security, systems develop-\n               ment security,\
    \ security awareness and training prac-\n               tices, organizational\
    \ and management security, data and\n               program security, processing\
    \ and operations security,\n               ergonomics and error prevention, environmental\
    \ secu-\n               rity, and backup and recovery security.\n            \
    \   The questions are weighted as to their importance, and\n               the\
    \ report generator can sort the questions by weight.\n               This way\
    \ the most important issues can be tackled\n               first.\n          MECHANISM\n\
    \               The questions are displayed on the screen and the user\n     \
    \          is prompted for a single keystroke reply.  When the end\n         \
    \      of one of the thirteen sections is reached, the answers\n             \
    \  are written to a disk file.  The question file and the\n               answer\
    \ file are merged to create the report file.\n          CAVEATS\n            \

    \               Netlabs' Dual Manager provides management of TCP/IP\n        \
    \       networks using both SNMP and CMOT protocols.  Such\n               management\
    \ can be initiated either through the X-\n               Windows user interface\
    \ (both Motif and Openlook), or\n               through OSI Network Management\
    \ (CMIP) commands.  The\n               Dual Manager provides for configuration,\
    \ fault, secu-\n               rity and performance management.  It provides extensive\n\
    \               map management features, including scanned maps in the\n     \
    \          background.  It provides simple mechanisms to extend\n            \
    \   the MIB and assign specific lists of objects to\n               specific network\
    \ elements, thereby providing for the\n               management of all vendors'\
    \ specific MIB extensions.  It\n               provides an optional relational\
    \ DBMS for storing and\n               retrieving MIB and alarm information. \
    \ Finally, the\n               Dual Manager is an open platform, in that it provides\n\
    \               several Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) for\n      \
    \         users to extend the functionality of the Dual Manager.\n           \
    \    The Dual Manager is expected to work as a TCP/IP\n               \"branch\
    \ manager\" under DEC's EMA, AT&T's UNMA and other\n               OSI-conformant\
    \ enterprise management architectures.\n          MECHANISM\n               The\
    \ Netlabs Dual Manager supports the control and moni-\n               toring of\

    \          KEYWORDS\n               traffic; ethernet, IP; eavesdrop; VMS; free.\n\
    \          ABSTRACT\n               ENTM is a screen-oriented utility that runs\
    \ under\n               VAX/VMS.  It monitors local ethernet traffic and\n   \
    \            displays either a real time or cumulative, histogram\n          \
    \     showing a percent breakdown of traffic by ethernet pro-\n              \
    \ tocol type.  The information in the display can be\n               reported\
    \ based on packet count or byte count.  The per-\n               cent of broadcast,\
    \ multicast and approximate lost pack-\n               ets is reported as well.\
    \  The screen display is updated\n               every three seconds.  Additionally,\
    \ a real time, slid-\n               ing history window may be displayed showing\
    \ ethernet\n               traffic patterns for the last five minutes.\n     \
    \          ENTM can also report IP traffic statistics by packet\n            \
    \   count or byte count.  The IP histograms reflect infor-\n               mation\
    \ collected at the TCP and UDP port level, includ-\n               ing ICMP type/code\
    \ combinations.  Both the ethernet and\n               IP histograms may be sorted\
    \ by ASCII protocol/port name\n               or by percent-value.  All screen\
    \ displays can be saved\n               in a file for printing later.\n      \
    \    MECHANISM\n               This utility simply places the ethernet controller\
    \ in\n               promiscuous mode and monitors the local area network\n  \
    \             traffic.  It preallocates 10 receive buffers and\n             \
    \  attempts to keep 22 reads pending on the ethernet dev-\n               ice.\n\
    \          CAVEATS\n               Placing the ethernet controller in promiscuous\
    \ mode may\n               severly slow down a VAX system.  Depending on the speed\n\
    \               of the VAX system and the amount of traffic on the  lo-\n    \
    \           cal  ethernet,  a large amount of CPU time may be spent\n        \
    \       on the Interrupt Stack.  Running this code on any  pro-\n            \
    \   duction system during operational hours is discouraged.\n          BUGS\n\
    \               Due to a bug in the VAX/VMS ethernet/802 device driver,\n    \
    \           IEEE  802 format packets may not always be detected.  A\n        \
    \       simple test is performed to \"guess\" which  packets  are\n          \
    \     in  IEEE  802  format (DSAP equal to SSAP).  Thus, some\n              \
    \ DSAP/SSAP pairs may be reported as  an  ethernet  type,\n               while\
    \  valid ethernet types may be reported as IEEE 802\n               packets.\n\
    \               In some hardware configurations, placing an ethernet\n       \
    \        controller in promiscuous mode with automatic-restart\n             \
    \  enabled will hang the controller.  Our VAX 8650 hangs\n               running\
    \ this code, while our uVAX IIs and uVAX IIIs do\n               not.\n      \

    \ 802 packets are not examined.\n               Only the presence of IEEE 802\
    \ packets on the wire is\n               reported.\n               The count of\
    \ lost packets is approximated.  If, after\n               each read completes\
    \ on the ethernet device, the utility\n               detects that it has no reads\
    \ pending on that device,\n               the lost packet counter is incremented\
    \ by one.\n               When the total number of bytes processed exceeds\n \

    \ the packets that traverse a network\n               interface, and outputs a\
    \ text file describing the\n               traffic.  In the file, a single line\

    \ protocol\n               type, length, source, and destination.  Etherfind can\n\
    \               print out all packet traffic on the ethernet, or\n           \
    \    traffic for the local host.  Further packet filtering\n               can\
    \ be done on the basis of protocol: IP, ARP, RARP,\n               ICMP, UDP,\

    \ (or\n               lack of same) to the UDP packet is ignored.  The cache\n\
    \               will be checked up to four times at one-quarter-second\n     \

    \               The Network Applications Technology (NAT) EtherMeter\n       \
    \        product is a dedicated ethernet traffic monitor that\n              \
    \ provides statistics on the ethernet segment to which it\n               is attached.\
    \  The EtherMeter reports three major kinds\n               of statistics.  For\
    \ good packets, it reports the total\n               number of good packets seen\
    \ on the segment, the number\n               of multicast and broadcast packets,\
    \ and the total\n               number of bytes in all packets seen.  For packets\
    \ with\n               errors, it reports the number of CRC errors, short\n  \
    \             packets, oversize packets, and alignment errors.  It\n         \
    \      also reports the distribution of packet by type, and\n               the\
    \ number of protocols seen on the segment.  A count\n               of transmit\
    \ collisions is reported.  Peak and current\n               ethernet utilization\
    \ rates are also reported, etc.\n               Alarms can be set for utilization\
    \ rate, packet rate,\n               total error count, and delta error.\n   \
    \            The EtherMeter reports the statistics to a Network\n            \
    \   Management Station (NMS), also available from NAT, via\n               IP/UDP\
    \ datagrams, so that the meters can be monitored\n               through routers.\
    \  The NMS displays graphical and/or\n               textual information, and\
    \ EtherMeter icons turn colors\n               to indicate status.  Alarms can\
    \ be set, and if the lev-\n               els are exceeded an audible alarm is\
    \ generated on the\n               NMS, and the EtherMeter icon changes from green\
    \ to yel-\n               low on the network map.\n          MECHANISM\n     \
    \          The EtherMeter is a self-contained board that can\n               either\
    \ be plugged into a PC/AT bus for power or\n               installed in a small\
    \ stand-alone enclosure.  The board\n               can be obtained with either\
    \ a 10BASE5 thick ethernet\n               transceiver cable connector, or a 10BASE2\
    \ thin ethernet\n               BNC connector.\n          CAVEATS\n          \
    \     The EtherMeter is primarily a passive device whose only\n              \
    \ impact  on  the  network  will come from the monitoring\n               packets\
    \ sent to the NMS.  The EtherMeter is assigned an\n               IP address for\
    \ communication with the NMS.\n          BUGS\n               None known.\n  \

    \               product in the first half of 1990.  Currently the NMS\n      \
    \         does not keep log files.  This limitation is ack-\n               nowledged,\

    \               EtherView is a network monitoring tool which runs on\n       \
    \        Sun workstations and allows you to monitor your hetero-\n           \
    \    geneous internet network.  It monitors all systems on\n               the\
    \ ethernet.  It has three primary functions:\n               Load Profile:  It\
    \ allows users to monitor the load on\n               the ethernet over extended\
    \ periods of time.  The net-\n               work administrator can use it to\
    \ characterize load gen-\n               erated by a node on the network, determine\
    \ which sys-\n               tems and applications generate how much of the load\
    \ and\n               how that load fluctuates over long periods of time.\n  \
    \             NFS Profile:  It allows the network administrator to\n         \
    \      determine the load on NFS servers, the average response\n             \
    \  time NFS servers and the mix of NFS load on each of the\n               servers.\
    \  Users can use the data to benchmark different\n               NFS servers,\
    \ determine which servers are overloaded,\n               deduce the number of\
    \ clients that each server can sup-\n               port and evaluate the effectiveness\
    \ of NFS accelera-\n               tors.\n               Protocol Analyzer:  Users\
    \ can capture packets based on\n               source, destination, application,\
    \ protocol, bit pat-\n               tern, packet size or a boolean filtering\
    \ expression.\n               It provides all standard features such as configurable\n\
    \               buffer size, packet slicing and bit pattern based\n          \
    \     triggering criterion.  It does automatic disassembly of\n              \
    \ NFS, TCP, UDP, IP, ICMP, ARP and RARP packets.  Packets\n               can\
    \ be examined in any combination of summary, hex or\n               detail format.\n\
    \          MECHANISM\n               EtherView uses the Sun's NIT interface to\
    \ turn the eth-\n               ernet interface into promiscuous mode to capture\
    \ pack-\n               ets.  A high level process manages the interface and a\n\
    \               low level process does the actual capturing and filter-\n    \
    \           ing.  Shared memory is used to communicate between the\n         \
    \      two processes.\n          BUGS\n               None known.\n          LIMITATIONS\n\

    \ PC to a desti-\n               nation.  Hopcheck uses the same mechanism as\
    \ traceroute\n               but is for use on IBM PC compatibles that have ethernet\n\
    \               connections.  Hopcheck is part of a larger TCP/IP pack-\n    \
    \           age that is known as ka9q that is for use with packet\n          \
    \     radio.  Ka9q can coexist on a PC with other TCP/IP\n               packages\
    \ such as FTP Inc's PC/TCP, but must be used\n               independently of\
    \ other packages.  Ka9q was written by\n               Phil Karn.  Hopcheck was\
    \ added by Katie Stevens,\n               dkstevens@ucdavis.edu.  Unlike traceroute,\
    \ which\n               requires a UNIX kernel mod, hopcheck will run on the\n\

    \ ABSTRACT\n               HyperMIB is a hypertext presentation of the MIB\n \
    \              (RFC1066).  The tree structure of the MIB is presented\n      \
    \         graphically, and the user traverses the tree by select-\n          \
    \     ing branches of the tree.  When the MIB variables are\n               displayed,\
    \ selecting them causes a text window to\n               appear and show the definition\
    \ of that variable (using\n               the actual text of the MIB document).\n\
    \          MECHANISM\n               The Apple Macintosh HyperCard utility is\
    \ used.  The\n               actual text of the MIB document is read into scrollable\n\
    \               text windows, and a string search is done on the vari-\n     \
    \          able selected.  A person familiar with HyperCard pro-\n           \
    \    gramming could modify the program to suit their needs\n               (such\

    \ Rover is a prototype network monitor that uses\n               multiple protocol\
    \ \"modules\" to test network functional-\n               ity.  This package consists\
    \ of two primary pieces of\n               code: the data collector and the problem\
    \ display.\n               There is one data collector that performs a series\
    \ of\n               network tests, and maintains a list of problems with\n  \
    \             the network.  There can be many display processes all\n        \
    \       displaying the current list of problems which is useful\n            \
    \   in a multi-operator NOC.\n               The display task uses curses, allowing\
    \ many terminal\n               types to display the problem file either locally\
    \ or\n               from a remote site.  Full source is provided.  The data\n\

    \      script extensions are welcome.\n          MECHANISM\n               A configuration\
    \ file contains a list of nodes,\n               addresses, NodeUp? protocol test\
    \ (ping in most cases),\n               and a list of further tests to be performed\
    \ if the node\n               is in fact up.  Modules are included to test TELNET,\n\
    \               FTP, and SMTP.  If the configuration contains a test\n       \
    \        that isn't recognized, a generic test is assumed, and a\n           \
    \    filename is checked for existence.  This way users can\n               create\
    \ scripts that create a file if there is a prob-\n               lem, and the\
    \ data collector simply checks the existence\n               of that file to determine\

    \          ABSTRACT\n               LAN Patrol is a full-featured network analyzer\
    \ that\n               provides essential information for effective fault and\n\
    \               performance management.  It allows network managers to\n     \
    \          easily monitor user activity, find traffic overloads,\n           \
    \    plan for growth, test cable, uncover intruders, balance\n               network\

    \ performs\n               remote and local monitoring of ethernet LANs in a pro-\n\
    \               tocol and vendor independent manner.\n               LanProbe\
    \ discovers each active node on a segment and\n               displays it on a\
    \ map with its adapter card vendor name,\n               ethernet address, and\
    \ IP address.  Additional informa-\n               tion about the nodes, such\
    \ as equipment type and physi-\n               cal location can be entered in\
    \ to the data base by the\n               user.\n               When the NodeLocator\
    \ option is used, data on the actual\n               location of nodes is automatically\
    \ entered and the map\n               becomes an accurate representation of the\
    \ physical lay-\n               out of the segment.  Thereafter when a new node\
    \ is\n               installed and becomes active, or when a node is moved\n \
    \              or becomes inactive, the change is detected and shown\n       \
    \        on the map in real time.  The system also provides the\n            \
    \   network manager with precise cable fault information\n               displayed\
    \ on the map.\n               Traffic statistics are gathered and displayed and\

    \ to either\n               the host or the network.  LANWatch is an invaluable\n\
    \               tool for installing, troubleshooting, and monitoring\n       \
    \        local area networks, and for developing and debugging\n             \
    \  new protocols.  Network managers using LANWatch can\n               inspect\
    \ network traffic patterns and packet errors to\n               isolate performance\
    \ problems and bottlenecks.  Protocol\n               developers can use LANWatch\
    \ to inspect and verify\n               proper protocol handling.  Since LANWatch\
    \ is a\n               software-only package which installs easily in existing\n\
    \               PCs, network technicians and field service engineers\n       \
    \        can carry LANWatch in their briefcase for convenient\n              \
    \ network analysis at remote sites.\n               LANWatch has two operating\

    \   ABSTRACT\n               NETMON is a facility to enable communication of net-\n\
    \               working events from the BSD UNIX operating system to a\n     \
    \          user-level network monitoring or management program.\n            \
    \   Iptrace is a program interfacing to NETMON which logs\n               TCP-IP\
    \ traffic for performance measurement and gateway\n               monitoring.\
    \ It is easy to build other NETMON-based\n               tools using iptrace as\
    \ a model.\n               NETMON resides in the 4.3BSD UNIX kernel.  It is\n\
    \               independent of hardware-specific code in UNIX.  It is\n      \
    \         transparent to protocol and network type, having no\n              \
    \ internal assumptions about the network protocols being\n               recorded.\
    \  It is installed in BSD-like kernels by\n               adding a standard function\
    \ call (probe) to a few points\n               in the input and output routines\
    \ of the protocols to be\n               logged.\n               NETMON is analogous\
    \ to Sun Microsystems' NIT, but the\n               interface tap function is\
    \ extended by recording more\n               context information.  Aside from\
    \ the timestamp, the\n               choice of information recorded is up to the\
    \ installer\n               of the probes.  The NETMON probes added to the BSD\
    \ IP\n               code supplied with the distribution include as context:\n\
    \               input and output queue lengths, identification of the\n      \
    \         network interface, and event codes labeling packet dis-\n          \
    \     cards.  (The NETMON distribution is geared towards\n               measuring\
    \ the performance of BSD networking protocols\n               in an IP gateway).\n\
    \               NETMON is designed so that it can reside within the\n        \
    \       monitored system with minimal interference to the net-\n             \
    \  work processing.  The estimated and measured overhead\n               is around\
    \ five percent of packet processing.\n               The user-level tool \"iptrace\"\
    \ is provided with NETMON.\n               This program logs IP traffic, either\
    \ at IP-level only,\n               or as it passes through the network interface\
    \ drivers\n               as well.  As a separate function, iptrace produces a\n\
    \               host traffic matrix output.  Its third type of output\n      \
    \         is abbreviated sampling, in which only a pre-set number\n          \
    \     of packets from each new host pair is logged.  The\n               three\
    \ output types are configured dynamically, in any\n               combination.\n\
    \               OSITRACE, another logging tool with a NETMON interface,\n    \
    \           is available separately (and documented in a separate\n          \
    \     entry in this catalog).\n          MECHANISM\n               Access to the\
    \ information logged by NETMON is through a\n               UNIX special file,\
    \ /dev/netmon.  User reads are blocked\n               until the buffer reaches\
    \ a configurable level of full-\n               ness.\n               Several\
    \ other parameters of NETMON can be tuned at com-\n               pile time. \
    \ A diagnostic program, netmonstat, is\n               included in the distribution.\n\

    \ SNMP; DOS; sourcelib.\n          ABSTRACT\n               The NETMON application\
    \ implements a network management\n               station based on a low-cost\
    \ DOS-based platform.  It can\n               be successfully used with many types\
    \ of networks,\n               including both wide area networks and those based\
    \ on\n               various LAN media.  NETMON has been used with multipro-\n\
    \               tocol devices including those which support TCP/IP,\n        \
    \       DECnet, and OSI protocols.  The fault management tool\n              \
    \ displays the map of the network configuration with\n               current node\
    \ and link state indicated in one of several\n               colors.  Alarms may\
    \ be enabled to alert the operator of\n               events occurring in the\
    \ network.  Events are logged to\n               disk.  The NETMON application\
    \ comes complete with\n               source code including a powerful set of\
    \ portable\n               libraries for generating and parsing SNMP messages.\n\
    \               Output data from NETMON may be transferred via flat\n        \
    \       files for additional report generation by a variety of\n             \
    \  statistical packages.\n          MECHANISM\n               The NETMON application\
    \ is based on the Simple Network\n               Management Protocol (SNMP). \
    \ Polling is performed via\n               the powerful SNMP get-next operator\
    \ and the SNMP get\n               operator.  Trap directed polling is used to\
    \ regulate\n               the focus and intensity of the polling.\n         \

    \               This tool monitors traffic on network segments.  All\n       \
    \        information is dumped to either a log file or, for\n               real-time\
    \ viewing, to a command tool window.  Data is\n               time-stamped according\
    \ to date and time.  Logging can\n               continue for up to 24 hours.\n\
    \               The tool is flexible in data collection and presenta-\n      \
    \         tion.  Traffic filters can be specified according to\n             \
    \  header values of numerous protocols, including those\n               used by\
    \ Apple, DEC, Sun, HP, and Apollo.  Bandwidth\n               utilization can\
    \ be monitored, as well as actual load\n               and peak throughput.  Additionally,\

    \ record\n               the location of all operational nodes on a network.\n\
    \               Data can be displayed in six separate formats of bar\n       \

    \ uses ICMP echo (and DECnet reachability\n               information on VAX/VMS)\
    \ to monitor a network.  The mon-\n               itoring is very simplistic,\
    \ but has proved useful.  It\n               periodically tests whether hosts\
    \ are reachable and\n               reports the results in a full-screen display.\
    \  It\n               groups hosts together in common sets.  If all hosts in\n\
    \               a set become unreachable, it makes a lot of racket with\n    \
    \           bells, since it assumes that this means that some com-\n         \
    \      mon piece of hardware that supports that set has\n               failed.\
    \  The periodicity of the tests, hosts to test,\n               and groupings\
    \ of hosts are controlled with a single\n               configuration file.\n\
    \               The idea for this program came from the PC/IP monitor\n      \
    \         facility, but is an entirely different program with\n              \
    \ different functionality.\n          MECHANISM\n               Reachability is\
    \ tested using ICMP echo facilities for\n               TCP/IP hosts (and DECnet\
    \ reachability information on\n               VAX/VMS).  A DECnet node is considered\
    \ reachable if it\n               appears in the list of hosts in a \"show network\"\
    \ com-\n               mand issued on a routing node.\n          CAVEATS\n   \
    \            This facility has been found to be most useful when run\n       \
    \        in a window on a workstation rather than on a terminal\n            \
    \   connected to a host.  It could be useful if ported to a\n               PC\
    \ (looks easy using FTP Software's programming\n               libraries), but\
    \ this has not been done.  Curses is very\n               slow and cpu intensive\
    \ on VMS, but the tool has been\n               run in a window on a VAXstation\

    \               The number and percentage of packets received in each\n      \
    \         category is displayed on the screen in a continuously\n            \
    \   updated display.\n               All exported file systems are monitored by\
    \ default.\n               Other files may optionally be monitored.  Options also\n\
    \               allow monitoring of traffic destined for a remote host\n     \
    \          instead of the local host, or monitoring traffic sent\n           \
    \    by a single host.  Items such as the sample interval\n               length\
    \ can be adjusted either on the command line or\n               interactively.\

    \ Nfswatch uses the Network Interface Tap in promiscuous\n               mode\
    \ to monitor the ethernet.  It filters out NFS pack-\n               ets destined\
    \ for the local (or remote) host, and then\n               decodes the file handles\
    \ in order to determine which\n               file or file system a request pertains\
    \ to.\n          CAVEATS\n               Because the NFS file handle is a non-standard\
    \ (server\n               private) piece of data, the file system monitoring part\n\
    \               of the program will break whenever the format of a file\n    \

    \       Nhfsstone (pronounced n-f-s-stone, the \"h\" is silent)\n            \
    \   is an NFS benchmarking program.  It is used on an NFS\n               client\
    \ to generate an artificial load with a particular\n               mix of NFS\
    \ operations.  It reports the average response\n               time of the server\
    \ in milliseconds per call and the\n               load in calls per second. \
    \ The nhfsstone distribution\n               includes a script, \"nhfsnums\" that\
    \ converts test\n               results into plot(5) format so that they can be\
    \ graphed\n               using graph(1) and other tools.\n          MECHANISM\n\
    \               Nhfsstone is an NFS traffic generator.  It adjusts its\n     \
    \          calling patterns based on the client's kernel NFS\n               statistics\
    \ and the elapsed time.  Load can be generated\n               over a given time\
    \ or number of NFS calls.\n          CAVEATS\n               Nhfsstone will compete\

    \               NNStat is a collection of programs that provides an\n        \
    \       internet statistic collecting capability.  The NNStat\n              \
    \ strategy for statistic collection is to collect traffic\n               statistics\
    \ via a promiscuous ethernet tap on the local\n               networks, versus\
    \ instrumenting the gateways.  If all\n               traffic entering or leaving\
    \ a network or set of net-\n               works traverses a local ethernet, then\
    \ by stationing a\n               statistic gathering agent on each local network\
    \ a pro-\n               file of network traffic can be gathered.  Statistical\n\
    \               data is retrieved from the local agents by a global\n        \
    \       manager.\n               A program called \"statspy\" performs the data\
    \ gathering\n               function.  Essentially, statspy reads all packets\
    \ on an\n               ethernet interface and records all information of\n  \
    \             interest.  Information of interest is gathered by exa-\n       \
    \        mining each packet and determining if the source or\n               destination\
    \ IP address is one that is being monitored,\n               typically a gateway\
    \ address.  If so then the contents\n               of the packet are examined\
    \ to see if they match further\n               criteria.\n               A program\
    \ called \"collect\" performs global data collec-\n               tion.  It periodically\
    \ polls various statspy processes\n               in the domain of interest to\
    \ retrieve locally logged\n               statistical data.\n               The\
    \ NNSTAT distribution comes with several sample awk\n               programs which\
    \ process the logged output of the collect\n               program.\n        \

    \              map, routing, status; IP; ping; VMS; free.\n          ABSTRACT\n\
    \               NPRV is a full-screen, keypad-oriented utility that\n        \
    \       runs under VAX/VMS.  It allows the user to quickly scan\n            \
    \   through a user-defined list of IP addresses (or domain\n               names)\
    \ and verify a node's reachability.  The node's\n               reachability is\
    \ determined by performing an ICMP echo,\n               UDP echo and a TCP echo\
    \ at alternating three second\n               intervals.  The total number of\
    \ packets sent and\n               received are displayed, as well as the minimum,\
    \ average\n               and maximum round-trip times (in milliseconds) for each\n\
    \               type of echo.  Additionally, a \"trace route\" function\n    \
    \           is performed to determine the path from the local sys-\n         \
    \      tem to the remote host.  Once all of the trace route\n               information\
    \ has filled the screen, a \"snapshot\" of the\n               screen can be written\
    \ to a text file.  Upon exiting the\n               utility, these text files\
    \ can be used to generate a\n               logical network map showing host and\
    \ gateway intercon-\n               nectivity.\n          MECHANISM\n        \
    \       The ICMP echo is performed by sending ICMP ECHO REQUEST\n            \
    \   packets.  The UDP and TCP echoes are performed by con-\n               necting\
    \ to the UDP/TCP echo ports (port number 7).  The\n               trace route\
    \ information is compiled by sending alter-\n               nating ICMP ECHO REQUEST\
    \ packets and UDP packets with\n               very large destination UDP port\
    \ numbers (in two\n               passes).  Each packet is initially sent with\
    \ a TTL\n               (time to live) of 1.  This should cause an ICMP TIME\n\
    \               EXCEEDED error to be generated by the first routing\n        \
    \       gateway.  Then each packet is sent with a TTL of 2.\n               This\
    \ should cause an ICMP TIME EXCEEDED error to be\n               generated by\
    \ the second routing gateway.  Then each\n               packet is sent with a\
    \ TTL of 3, and so on.  This pro-\n               cess continues until an ICMP\
    \ ECHO REPLY or UDP PORT\n               UNREACHABLE is received.  This indicates\
    \ that the\n               remote host has been reached and that the trace route\n\
    \               information is complete.\n          CAVEATS\n               This\
    \ utility sends one echo packet per second (ICMP,\n               UDP or TCP),\
    \ as well as sending out one trace route\n               packet per second.  If\
    \ a transmitted trace route packet\n               is returned in less than one\
    \ second, another trace\n               route packet is sent in 100 milliseconds.\
    \  This could\n               cause a significant amount of contention on the\
    \ local\n               network.\n          BUGS\n               None known. \

    \ is displayed for each packet indicating the\n               time, source, destination,\
    \ length, packet type,\n               sequence number, credit, and any optional\
    \ parameters\n               contained in the packet.  Numerous options are avail-\n\
    \               able to control the output of OSITRACE.\n               To obtain\
    \ packets to analyze, OSITRACE uses Sun\n               Microsystems' Network\
    \ Interface Tap (NIT) in SunOS 3.4,\n               3.5, and 4.0.X.  OSITRACE\
    \ may also obtain data from the\n               NETMON utility which is described\
    \ as another tool\n               entry.\n               In Sun systems, OSITRACE\
    \ may be easily installed: OSI\n               kernel support is not needed, nor\

    \              SNMP proxy agents may be used to permit the monitoring\n      \
    \         and controlling of network elements which are otherwise\n          \
    \     not addressable using the SNMP management protocol\n               (e.g.,\
    \ a network bridge that implements a proprietary\n               management protocol).\
    \  Similarly, SNMP proxy agents may\n               be used to protect SNMP agents\
    \ from redundant network\n               management agents through the use of\
    \ caches.  Finally,\n               SNMP proxy agents may be used to implement\
    \ elaborate\n               MIB access policies.  The proxy agent daemon listens\n\
    \               for SNMP queries and commands from logically remote\n        \
    \       network management stations, translates and retransmits\n            \
    \   those as appropriate network management queries or\n               cache lookups,\
    \ listens for and parses the responses,\n               translates the responses\
    \ into SNMP responses, and\n               returns those responses as SNMP messages\
    \ to the network\n               management station that originated the transaction.\n\
    \               The proxy agent daemon also emits SNMP traps to identi-\n    \
    \           fied trap receivers.  The proxy agent daemon is archi-\n         \
    \      tected to make the addition of additional vendor-\n               specific\
    \ variables a straight-forward task.  The proxy\n               application comes\
    \ complete with source code including a\n               powerful set of portable\
    \ libraries for generating and\n               parsing SNMP messages and a set\
    \ of command line utili-\n               ties.\n          MECHANISM\n        \

    \ Reporting and Alarm Generation (SERAG)\n               collects error messages\
    \ and other event reports from\n               servers on a LAN.  Any node with\
    \ UDP/IP can be the\n               source of such messages/reports.  The logging\
    \ of error\n               messages is integrated with the audit trail facility\
    \ of\n               the Network Control Server (NCS) from 3COM.  Alarms are\n\
    \               generated on the NCS based on predefined conditions.\n       \
    \        Alarms may be sent to the console of the NCS, logged in\n           \
    \    a file, or routed via WAN to a service center.\n               SERAG can\
    \ automatically detect a predefined set of\n               errors in the servers\
    \ and generate alarms.  The break-\n               down of a server in the LAN\
    \ may also result in alarm\n               generation.\n               SERAG creates\
    \ an error log that can be used for post-\n               testing analysis.\n\
    \          MECHANISM\n               The tool searches through the audit trail\
    \ (error log)\n               files for events specified by the user.  The search\
    \ may\n               be constrained to specific nodes in the network and to\n\
    \               a specific time frame.  Events may be combined into\n        \
    \       conditions which are logical expressions (e.g., look\n               for\
    \ eventA and eventB and not eventC within time frame\n               so and so).\
    \  This is an interactive query facility to\n               analyze the audit\
    \ trail (error log).\n               The user may also ask for such conditions\
    \ to be checked\n               at regular intervals, and specify routing of error\
    \ mes-\n               sages in case the condition is satisfied.  The checking\n\
    \               of such conditions is done by a daemon process running\n     \
    \          in the background.\n          CAVEATS\n               May impact the\
    \ performance of the NCS if error logs are\n               big, or if conditions\
    \ are computationally complex.\n          BUGS\n               None known.\n \

    \ standalone.\n          ABSTRACT\n               The Network General Sniffer\
    \ is a protocol analyzer for\n               performing LAN diagnostics, monitoring,\
    \ traffic genera-\n               tion, and troubleshooting.  The Sniffer protocol\n\
    \               analyzer has the capability of capturing every packet\n      \
    \         on a network and of decoding all seven layers of the\n             \
    \  OSI protocol model.  Capture frame selection is based\n               on several\
    \ different filters: protocol content at lower\n               levels; node addresses;\
    \ pattern matching (up to 8\n               logically-related patterns of 32 bytes\
    \ each); and des-\n               tination class.  Users may extend the protocol\n\
    \               interpretation capability of the Sniffer by writing\n        \
    \       their own customized protocol interpreters and linking\n             \
    \  them to the Sniffer software.\n               The Sniffer displays network\
    \ traffic information and\n               performance statistics in real time,\
    \ in user-selectable\n               formats.  Numeric station addresses are translated\
    \ to\n               symbolic names or manufacturer ID names.  Network\n     \
    \          activities measured include frames accepted, Kbytes\n             \
    \  accepted, and buffer use.  Each network version has\n               additional\
    \ counters for activities specific to that\n               network.  Network activity\
    \ is expressed as\n               frames/second, Kbytes/second, or per cent of\
    \ network\n               bandwidth utilization.\n               Data collection\
    \ by the Sniffer may be output to printer\n               or stored to disk in\
    \ either print-file or spread-sheet\n               format.\n               Protocol\
    \ suites understood by the Sniffer include:\n               Banyan Vines, IBM\
    \ Token-Ring, Novell Netware, XNS/MS-\n               Net (3Com 3+), DECnet, TCP/IP\
    \ (including SNMP and\n               applications-layer protocols such as FTP,\
    \ SMTP, and\n               TELNET), X Windows (for X version 11), NFS, and several\n\
    \               SUN proprietary protocols (including mount, pmap, RPC,\n     \
    \          and YP).  Supported LANs include: ethernet, Token-ring\n          \
    \     (4Mb and 16Mb versions), ARCNET, StarLAN, IBM PC Net-\n               work\
    \ (Broadband), and Apple Localtalk Network.\n          MECHANISM\n           \
    \    The Sniffer is a self-contained, portable protocol\n               analyzer\
    \ that require only AC line power and connection\n               to a network\
    \ to operate.  Normally passive (except when\n               in Traffic Generator\
    \ mode), it captures images of all\n               or of selected frames in a\
    \ working buffer, ready for\n               immediate analysis and display.\n\
    \               The Sniffer is a standalone device.  Two platforms are\n     \
    \          available: one for use with single network topologies,\n          \
    \     the other for use with multi-network topologies.  Both\n               include\
    \ Sniffer core software, a modified network\n               interface card (or\
    \ multiple cards), and optional proto-\n               col interpreter suites.\n\
    \               All Sniffer functions may be remotely controlled from a\n    \
    \           modem-connected PC.  Output from the Sniffer can be\n            \
    \   imported to database or spreadsheet packages.\n          CAVEATS\n       \
    \        In normal use, the Sniffer is a passive device, and so\n            \
    \   will not adversely effect network performance.  Perfor-\n               mance\
    \ degradation will be observed, of course, if the\n               Sniffer is set\

    \             The SpiderMonitor and SpiderAnalyzer are protocol\n            \
    \   analyzers for performing ethernet LAN diagnostics, mon-\n               itoring,\
    \ traffic generation, and troubleshooting.  The\n               SpiderMonitor\
    \ has the capability of capturing every\n               packet on a network and\
    \ of decoding the first four\n               layers of the OSI protocol model.\
    \  The SpiderAnalyzer\n               has additional software for decoding higher\
    \ protocol\n               layers.  Protocol suites understood: TCP/IP (including\n\
    \               SNMP and applications-layer protocols), OSI, XNS, DEC-\n     \
    \          net and IPX.  User-definable decodes can be written in\n          \
    \     'C' with the Microsoft version 5.0 'C' compiler.  A\n               decode\
    \ guide is provided.\n               The SpiderAnalyzer supports multiple simultaneous\n\
    \               filters for capturing packets using predefined patterns\n    \
    \           and error states.  Filter patterns can also trigger on\n         \
    \      NOT matching 1 or more filters, an alarm, or a speci-\n               fied\
    \ time.\n               The SpiderAnalyzer can also employ TDR (Time Domain\n\
    \               Reflectometry) to find media faults, open or short cir-\n    \
    \           cuits, or transceiver faults.  It can transmit OSI,\n            \
    \   XNS, and Xerox link-level echo packets to user-\n               specified\
    \ stations, performs loop round tests.\n               In traffic generation mode,\
    \ the SpiderAnalyzer has the\n               ability to generate packets at random\
    \ intervals of ran-\n               dom lengths or any combination of random or\
    \ fixed\n               interval or length, generation of packets with CRC\n \
    \              errors, or packets that are too short, or packets that\n      \
    \         are too long.\n               Output from the SpiderMonitor/Analyzer\
    \ can be imported\n               to database or spreadsheet packages.\n     \
    \     MECHANISM\n               The SpiderMonitor and Spider Analyzer are available\
    \ as\n               stand-alone, IBM PC compatible packages based upon a\n  \
    \             Compaq III portable system, or as a plug-in boards for\n       \

    \ VMS; free.\n          ABSTRACT\n               Traceroute is a tool that allows\
    \ the route taken by\n               packets from source to destination to be\
    \ discovered.\n               It can be used for situations where the IP record\
    \ route\n               option would fail, such as intermediate gateways dis-\n\
    \               carding packets, routes that exceed the capacity of an\n     \
    \          datagram, or intermediate IP implementations that don't\n         \
    \      support record route.  Round trip delays between the\n               source\
    \ and intermediate gateways are also reported\n               allowing the determination\
    \ of individual gateways con-\n               tribution to end-to-end delay.\n\
    \               Enhanced versions of traceroute have been developed\n        \
    \       that allow specification of loose source routes for\n               datagrams.\
    \  This allows one to investigate the return\n               path from remote\
    \ machines back to the local host.\n          MECHANISM\n               Traceroute\
    \ relies on the ICMP TIME_EXCEEDED error\n               reporting mechanism.\
    \  When an IP packet is received by\n               an gateway with a time-to-live\
    \ value of 0, an ICMP\n               packet is sent to the host which generated\
    \ the packet.\n               By sending packets to a destination with a TTL of\
    \ 0,\n               the next hop can be identified as the source of the\n   \
    \            ICMP TIME EXCEEDED message.  By incrementing the TTL\n          \
    \     field the subsequent hops can be identified.  Each\n               packet\
    \ sent out is also time stamped.  The time stamp\n               is returned as\
    \ part of the ICMP packet so a round trip\n               delay can be calculated.\n\
    \          CAVEATS\n               Some IP implementations forward packets with\
    \ a TTL of\n               0, thus escaping identification.  Others use the TTL\n\
    \               field in the arriving packet as the TTL for the ICMP\n       \
    \        error reply, which delays identification.\n               Sending datagrams\
    \ with the source route option will\n               cause some gateways to crash.\
    \  It is considered poor\n               form to repeat this behavior.\n     \

    \ Control Center (NCC)\n               provides high-performance software to support\
    \ the\n               management and control of TCP/IP-based networks.  The\n\
    \               network management system uses the Simple Network\n          \
    \     Management Protocol (SNMP) to exchange management\n               information\
    \ between the NCC and network devices.  The\n               NCC supports the Management\
    \ Information Base (MIB)\n               [RFC-1066] and the Structure and Identification\
    \ of\n               Management Information for TCP/IP-based Internets\n     \
    \          [RFC-1065].  In addition, Unisys has extended the MIB\n           \
    \    definitions to support the features of Unisys FDDI LAN\n               devices,\
    \ such as the FDDI Smart Concentrators, the FDDI\n               Host Network\
    \ Front Ends, and the Remote FDDI, FDDI-to-\n               LAN, and FDDI-to-DDN\
    \ gateways.\n               The NCC supports seven applications.  The network\n\
    \               topology map displays the physical and logical maps of\n     \
    \          the network.  The configuration management tool sup-\n            \
    \   ports the modification and validation of network device\n               configuration\
    \ data as well as the modification of MIB\n               configuration data.\
    \  The performance monitoring tool\n               supports the collection and\
    \ analysis of statistical\n               parameters from network devices.  The\
    \ status monitoring\n               tool reports on the up/down status and responsiveness\n\
    \               of network devices using ICMP.  The accounting tool is\n     \
    \          used to collect, store, and display user job activity\n           \
    \    at the subscriber hosts.  The NCC database entry sup-\n               ports\
    \ RFC 1066 object definitions and Unisys-specific\n               object definitions\
    \ to support the Unisys FDDI devices.\n               And finally, the trap reporting\
    \ tool reports the\n               arrival of error and event notifications using\
    \ UDP\n               datagrams.  The NCC supports all the trap messages\n   \
    \            defined in RFC 1098.\n          MECHANISM\n               The NCC\

    \ representation of\n               performance and status of SNMP-capable network\
    \ ele-\n               ments.  Xnetmon presents a schematic network map\n    \
    \           representing the up/down status of network elements;\n           \
    \    xpmon draws a pen plot style graph of the change over\n               time\
    \ of any arbitrary MIB object (RFC1066).  Both xnet-\n               mon and xpmon\
    \ use the SNMP (RFC1098) for retrieving\n               status and performance\
    \ data.\n          MECHANISM\n               Xnetmon polls network elements for\
    \ the status of their\n               interfaces on a controllable polling interval.\
    \  Pop-up\n               windows displaying the values of any MIB variable are\n\
    \               supported by separate polls.  When SNMP traps are\n          \
    \     received from a network element, that element and all\n               adjacent\
    \ elements are immediately re-polled to update\n               their status. \
    \ The layout of the network map is stati-\n               cally configured.  Xpmon\
    \ repeatedly polls (using SNMP)\n               the designated network element\
    \ for the value of the\n               designated MIB variable on the user-specified\
    \ interval.\n               The change in the variable is then plotted on the\
    \ strip\n               chart.  The strip chart regularly adjusts its scale to\n\
    \               the current maximum value on the graph.\n          CAVEATS\n \
    \              Polling intervals should be chosen with care so as not\n      \

    \ application implements a powerful network\n               management station\
    \ based on the X window system.  It\n               provides network managers\
    \ tools for fault management,\n               configuration management, performance\
    \ management, and\n               security management.  It can be successfully\
    \ used with\n               many types of networks including those based on various\n\
    \               LAN media, and wide area networks.  XNETMON has been\n       \
    \        used with multiprotocol devices including those which\n             \
    \  support TCP/IP, DECnet, and OSI protocols.  The fault\n               management\
    \ tool displays the map of the network confi-\n               guration with node\
    \ and link state indicated in one of\n               several colors to indicate\
    \ current status.  Alarms may\n               be enabled to alert the operator\
    \ of events occurring in\n               the network.  Events are logged to disk.\
    \  The confi-\n               guration management tool may be used to edit the\
    \ net-\n               work management information base stored in the network\n\
    \               management station to reflect changes occurring in the\n     \
    \          network.  Other features include graphs and tabular\n             \
    \  tools for use in fault and performance management and\n               mechanisms\
    \ by which additional variables, such as\n               vendor-specific variables,\
    \ may be added.  The XNETMON\n               application comes complete with source\
    \ code including a\n               powerful set of portable libraries for generating\
    \ and\n               parsing SNMP messages.  Output data from XNETMON may be\n\

    \                             Network Management Tutorial\n          This tutorial\
    \ is an overview of the practice of network\n          management.  Reading this\
    \ section is no substitute for know-\n          ing your system, and knowing how\
    \ it is used.  Do not wait\n          until things break to learn what they ought\
    \ to do or how\n          they usually work: a crisis is not the time for determining\n\
    \          how \"normal\" packet traces should look.  Furthermore, it\n      \
    \    takes little imagination to realize that you do not want to\n          be\
    \ digging through manuals while your boss is screaming for\n          network\
    \ service to be restored.\n          We assume an acquaintance with the TCP/IP\
    \ protocol suite and\n          the Internet architecture.  There are many available\
    \ refer-\n          ences on these topics, several of which are listed below in\n\
    \          Section 7.\n          Since many of the details of network management\
    \ are system-\n          specific, this tutorial is a bit superficial.  There\
    \ is,\n          however, a more fundamental problem in prescribing network\n\
    \          management practices: network management is not a well-\n         \
    \ understood endeavor.  At present, the cutting edge of net-\n          work management\
    \ is the use of distributed systems to collect\n          and exchange status\
    \ information, and then to display the\n          data as histograms or trend\
    \ lines.  It is not clear that we\n          know what data should be collected,\
    \ how to analyze it when\n          we get it, or how to structure our collection\
    \ systems.  For\n          now, automated, real-time control of internets is an\
    \ aspira-\n          tion, rather than a reality.  The communications systems\n\
    \          that we field are apparently more complex than we can\n          comprehend,\
    \ which no doubt accounts in part for their fre-\n          quently surprising\
    \ behavior.\n          The first section of this tutorial lists the overall goals\n\
    \          and functions of network management.  It presents several\n       \
    \   aspects of network management, including system monitoring,\n          fault\
    \ detection and isolation, performance testing, confi-\n          guration management,\
    \ and security.  These discussions are\n          followed by a bibliographic\
    \ section.  The tutorial closes\n          with some final advice for network\
    \ managers.\n          1. Network Management Goals and Functions\n          An\
    \ organization's view of network management goals is shaped\n          by two\
    \ factors:\n               1.   people in the organization depend on the system\n\
    \                    working,\n               2.   LANs, routers, lines, and other\
    \ communications\n                    resources have costs.\n          From the\
    \ organizational vantage point, the ultimate goal of\n          network management\
    \ is to provide a consistent, predictable,\n          acceptable level of service\
    \ from the available data communi-\n          cations resources.  To achieve this,\
    \ a network manager must\n          first be able to perform fault detection,\
    \ isolation, and\n          correction.  He must also be able to effect configuration\n\
    \          changes with a minimum of disruption, and measure the utili-\n    \
    \      zation of system components.\n          People actually managing networks\
    \ have a different focus.\n          Network managers are usually evaluated by\
    \ the availability\n          and performance of their communications systems,\
    \ even though\n          many factors of net performance are beyond their control.\n\
    \          To them, the most important requirement of a network manage-\n    \
    \      ment tool is that it allows the detection and diagnosis of\n          faults\
    \ before users can call to complain: users (and bosses)\n          can often be\
    \ placated just by knowing that a network problem\n          has been diagnosed.\
    \  Another vital network management func-\n          tion is the ability to collect\
    \ data that justify current or\n          future expenditures for the data communications\
    \ plant and\n          staff.\n          Following a section on system monitoring,\
    \ this tutorial\n          addresses fault, performance, configuration, and security\n\
    \          management.  By fault management, we mean the detection,\n        \
    \  diagnosis, and correction of network malfunctions.  Under\n          the subject\
    \ of performance management, we include support\n          for predictable, efficient\
    \ service, as well as capacity\n          planning and capacity testing.  Configuration\
    \ management\n          includes support for orderly configuration changes (usually,\n\
    \          system growth), and local administration of component names\n     \
    \     and addresses.  Security management includes both protecting\n         \
    \ system components from damage and protecting sensitive\n          information\
    \ from unintentional or malicious disclosure or\n          corruption.\n     \
    \     Readers familiar with the ISO management standards and\n          drafts\
    \ will note both that we have borrowed heavily from the\n          \"OSI Management\
    \ Framework,\" except that we have omitted the\n          \"account management\"\
    \ function.  Account management seems a\n          bit out of place with the other\
    \ network management\n          functions.  The logging required by account management\
    \ is\n          likely to be done by specialized, dedicated subsystems that\n\
    \          are distinct from other network management components.\n          Hence,\
    \ this tutorial does not cover account management.\n          Rest assured, however,\
    \ that account management, if required,\n          will be adequately supported\
    \ and staffed.\n          For those with a DoD background, security may also seem\
    \ out\n          of place as a subtopic of network management.  Without\n    \
    \      doubt, communications security is an important issue that\n          should\
    \ be considered in its own right.  Because of the\n          requirements of trust\
    \ for security mechanisms, security com-\n          ponents will probably not\
    \ be integrated subcomponents of a\n          larger network management system.\
    \  Nevertheless, because a\n          network manager has a responsibility to\
    \ protect his system\n          from undue security risks, this tutorial includes\
    \ a discus-\n          sion on internet security.\n          2. System Monitoring\n\
    \          System monitoring is a fundamental aspect of network manage-\n    \
    \      ment.  One can divide system monitoring into two rough\n          categories:\
    \ error detection and baseline monitoring.\n          System errors, such as misformatted\
    \ frames or dropped pack-\n          ets, are not in themselves cause for concern.\
    \  Spikes in\n          error rates, however, should be investigated.  It is sound\n\
    \          practice to log error rates over time, so that increases can\n    \
    \      be recognized.  Furthermore, logging error rates as a func-\n         \
    \ tion of traffic rates can be used to detect congestion.\n          Investigate\
    \ unusual error rates and other anomalies as they\n          are detected, and\
    \ keep a notebook to record your\n          discoveries.\n          Day-to-day\
    \ traffic should be monitored, so that the opera-\n          tional baselines\
    \ of a system and its components can be\n          determined.  As well as being\
    \ essential for performance\n          management, baseline determination and\
    \ traffic monitoring\n          are the keys to early fault detection.\n     \
    \     A preliminary step to developing baseline measurements is\n          construction\
    \ of a system map: a graphical representation of\n          the system components\
    \ and their interfaces.  Then, measure-\n          ments of utilization (i.e.,\
    \ use divided by capacity) are\n          needed.  Problems are most likely to\
    \ arise, and system tun-\n          ing efforts are most likely to be beneficial,\
    \ at highly\n          utilized components.\n          It is worthwhile to develop\
    \ a source/destination traffic\n          matrix, including a breakdown of traffic\
    \ between the local\n          system and other internet sites.  Both volume and\
    \ type of\n          traffic should be logged, along with its evolution over\n\
    \          time.  Of particular interest for systems with diskless\n         \
    \ workstations is memory swapping and other disk server\n          access.  For\
    \ all systems, broadcast traffic and routing\n          traffic should be monitored.\
    \  Sudden increases in the vari-\n          ance of delay or the volume of routing\
    \ traffic may indicate\n          thrashing or other soft failures.\n        \
    \  In monitoring a system, long-term averages are of little\n          use.  Hourly\
    \ averages are a better indicator of system use.\n          Variance in utilization\
    \ and delay should also be tracked.\n          Sudden spikes in variance are tell-tale\
    \ signs that a problem\n          is looming or exists.  So, too, are trends of\
    \ increased\n          packet or line errors, broadcasts, routing traffic, or\n\
    \          delay.\n          3. Fault Detection and Isolation\n          When\
    \ a system fails, caution is in order.  A net manager\n          should make an\
    \ attempt to diagnose the cause of a system\n          crash before rebooting.\
    \  In many cases, however, a quick\n          diagnosis will not be possible.\
    \  For some high priority\n          applications, restoring at least some level\
    \ of service will\n          have priority over fault repair or even complete\
    \ fault diag-\n          nosis.  This necessitates prior planning.  A net manager\n\
    \          must know the vital applications at his site.  If applica-\n      \
    \    tions require it, he must also have a fall-back plan for\n          bringing\
    \ them online.  Meanwhile, repeated crashes or\n          hardware failures are\
    \ unambiguous signs of a problem that\n          must be corrected.\n        \
    \  A network manager should prepare for fault diagnosis by\n          becoming\
    \ familiar with how diagnostic tools respond to net-\n          work failure.\
    \  In times of relative peace, a net manager\n          should occasionally unplug\
    \ the network connection from an\n          unused workstation and then \"debug\"\
    \ the problem.\n          When diagnosing a fault or anomaly, it is vital to proceed\n\
    \          in an orderly manner, especially since network faults will\n      \
    \    usually generate spurious as well as accurate error mes-\n          sages.\
    \  Remember to keep in mind that the network itself is\n          failing.  Do\
    \ not place too much trust in anything obtained\n          remotely.  Furthermore,\
    \ it is unlikely to be significant\n          that remote information such as\
    \ DNS names or NFS files can-\n          not be obtained.\n          Even spurious\
    \ messages can be revealing, because they pro-\n          vide clues to the problem.\
    \  From the data at hand, develop\n          working hypotheses about probable\
    \ causes of the problems you\n          detect.  Direct your further data gathering\
    \ efforts so that\n          the information you get will either refute or support\
    \ your\n          hypotheses.\n          An orderly approach to debugging is facilitated\
    \ if it is\n          guided by a model of network behavior.  The following por-\n\
    \          tions of this section present such a model, along with a\n        \
    \  procedure for checking network connectivity.  The section\n          concludes\
    \ with  some hints for diagnosing a particularly\n          tricky class of connectivity\
    \ problem.\n          3.1 A Network Model as a Diagnostic Framework\n        \
    \  The point of having a model of how things work is to have a\n          basis\
    \ for developing educated guesses about how things go\n          wrong.  The problem\
    \ of cascading faults -- faults generating\n          other faults -- makes use\
    \ of a conceptual model a virtual\n          necessity.\n          In general,\
    \ only problems in a component's hardware or\n          operating system will\
    \ generate simultaneous faults in multi-\n          ple protocol layers.  Otherwise,\
    \ faults will propagate vert-\n          ically (up the protocol stack) or horizontally\
    \ (between\n          peer-level communications components).  Applying a concep-\n\
    \          tual model that includes the architectural relations of net-\n    \
    \      work components can help to order an otherwise senseless\n          barrage\
    \ of error messages and symptoms.\n          The model does not have to be formal\
    \ or complex to bring\n          structure to debugging efforts.  A useful start\
    \ is something\n          as simple as the following:\n               1.   Applications\
    \ programs use transport services:\n                    TCP/UDP.  Before using\
    \ service, applications that\n                    accept host names as parameters\
    \ must translate the\n                    names into IP addresses.  Translation\
    \ may be based\n                    on a static table lookup (/etc/hosts file\
    \ in UNIX\n                    hosts), the DNS, or yellow pages.  Nslookup and\n\
    \                    DiG are tools for monitoring the activities of the\n    \
    \                DNS.\n               2.   Transport protocol implementations\
    \ use IP ser-\n                    vices.  The local IP module makes the initial\n\
    \                    decision on forwarding.  An IP datagram is for-\n       \
    \             warded directly to the destination host if the\n               \
    \     destination is on the same network as the source.\n                    Otherwise,\
    \ the datagram is forwarded to a gateway\n                    attached to the\
    \ network.  On BSD hosts, the con-\n                    tents of a host's routing\
    \ table are visible by use\n                    of the \"netstat\" command.*\n\
    \               3.   IP implementations translate the IP address of a\n      \
    \              datagram's next hop (either the destination host\n            \
    \        or a gateway) to a local network address.  For\n                    ethernets,\
    \ the Address Resolution Protocol (ARP)\n                    is commonly used\
    \ for this translation.  On BSD\n                    systems, an interface's IP\
    \ address and other con-\n                    figuration options can be viewed\
    \ by use of the\n                    \"ifconfig\" command, while the contents\
    \ of a host's\n                    ARP cache may be viewed by use of \"arp\" command.\n\
    \               4.   IP implementations in hosts and gateways route\n        \
    \            datagrams based on subnet and net identifiers.\n                \
    \    Subnetting is a means of allocating and preserving\n                    IP\
    \ address space, and of insulating users from the\n                    topological\
    \ details of a multi-network campus.\n                    Sites that use subnetting\
    \ reserve portions of the\n                    IP address's host identifier to\
    \ indicate particu-\n                    lar networks at their campus.  Subnetting\
    \ is\n                    highly system-dependent.  The details are a criti-\n\
    \                    cal, though local, issue.  As for routing between\n     \
    \               separate networks, a variety of gateway-to-gateway\n         \
    \           protocols are used.  Traceroute is a useful tool\n               \
    \     for investigating routing problems.  The tool,\n                    \"query,\"\
    \ can be used to examine RIP routing\n                    tables.\n          A\
    \ neophyte network manager should expand the above descrip-\n          tion so\
    \ that it accurately describes his particular system,\n          _________________________\n\
    \          * Initial forwarding may actually be complex and\n          vulnerable\
    \ to multiple points of failure.  For example,\n          when sending an IP datagram,\
    \ 4.3BSD hosts first look\n          for a route to the particular host.  If none\
    \ has been\n          specified for the destination, then a search is made\n \
    \         for a route to the network of the destination.  If this\n          search\
    \ also fails, then as a last resort, a search is\n          made for a route to\
    \ a \"default\" gateway.  Routes to\n          hosts, networks, and the \"default\"\
    \ gateway may be stat-\n          ic, loaded at boot time and perhaps updated\
    \ by operator\n          commands.  Alternatively, they may be dynamic, loaded\n\
    \          from redirects and routing protocol updates.\n          and learn the\
    \ tools and techniques for monitoring the opera-\n          tions at each of the\
    \ above stages.\n          3.2 A Simple Procedure for Connectivity Check\n   \
    \       In this section, we describe a procedure for isolating a\n          TCP/IP\
    \ connectivity problem.** In this procedure, a series\n          of tests methodically\
    \ examine connectivity from a host,\n          starting with nearby resources\
    \ and working outward. The\n          steps in our connectivity-testing procedure\
    \ are:\n          1.   As an initial sanity check, ping your own IP address\n\
    \               and the loopback address.\n          2.   Next, try to ping other\
    \ IP hosts on the local subnet.\n               Use numeric addresses when starting\
    \ off, since this\n               eliminates the name resolvers and host tables\
    \ as poten-\n               tial sources of problems.  The lack of an answer may\n\
    \               indicate either that the destination host did not\n          \
    \     respond to ARP (if it is used on your LAN), or that a\n               datagram\
    \ was forwarded (and hence, the destination IP\n               address was resolved\
    \ to a local media address) but that\n               no ICMP Echo Reply was received.\
    \  This could indicate a\n               length-related problem, or misconfigured\
    \ IP Security.\n          3.   If an IP router (gateway) is in the system, ping\
    \ both\n               its near and far-side addresses.\n          4.   Make sure\
    \ that your local host recognizes the gateway\n               as a relay.  (For\
    \ BSD hosts, use netstat.)\n          5.addresses\n               Still using\
    \ numeric IP addresses, try to ping hosts\n               beyond the gateway.\
    \  If you get no response, run hop-\n               check or traceroute, if available.\
    \  Note whether your\n               packets even go to the gateway on their way\
    \ to the des-\n               tination.  If not, examine the methods used to instruct\n\
    \               your host to use this gateway to reach the specified\n       \
    \        destination net (e.g., is the default route in place?\n             \
    \  Alternatively, are you successfully wire-tapping the\n               IGP messages\
    \ broadcast on the net you are attached to?)\n          _________________________\n\
    \          ** Thanks to James VanBokkelen, president of FTP\n          Software,\
    \ for sharing with us a portion of a PC/TCP\n          support document, the basis\
    \ for the above connectivity\n          procedure.\n               If traceroute\
    \ is not available, ping, netstat, arp, and\n               a knowledge of the\
    \ IP addresses of all the gateway's\n               interfaces can be used to\
    \ isolate the cause of the\n               problem.  Use netstat to determine\
    \ your next hop to the\n               destination.  Ping that IP address to ensure\
    \ the router\n               is up.  Next, ping the router interface on the far\
    \ sub-\n               net.  If the router returns \"network unreachable\" or\n\
    \               other errors, investigate the router's routing tables\n      \
    \         and interface status.  If the pings succeed, ping the\n            \
    \   close interface of the succeeding next hop gateway, and\n               so\
    \ on.  Remember the routing along the outbound and\n               return paths\
    \ may be different.\n          6.   Once ping is working with numeric addresses,\
    \ use ping\n               to try to reach a few remote hosts by name.  If ping\n\
    \               fails when host names are used, check the operation of\n     \
    \          the local name-mapping system (i.e., with nslookup or\n           \
    \    DiG).  If you want to use \"shorthand\" forms (\"myhost\"\n             \
    \  instead of \"myhost.mydomain.com\"), be sure that the\n               alias\
    \ tables are correctly configured.\n          7.   Once basic reachability has\
    \ been established with ping,\n               try some TCP-based applications:\
    \ FTP and TELNET are\n               supported on almost all IP hosts, but FINGER\
    \ is a\n               simpler protocol.  The Berkeley-specific protocols\n  \
    \             (RSH, RCP, REXEC and LPR) require extra configuration\n        \
    \       on the server host before they can work, and so are\n               poor\
    \ choices for connectivity testing.\n          If problems arise in steps 2-7\
    \ above, rerunning the tests\n          while executing a line monitor (e.g.,\
    \ etherfind, netwatch,\n          or tcpdump) can help to pinpoint the problem.\n\
    \          The above procedure is sound and useful, especially if lit-\n     \
    \     tle is known about the cause of the connectivity problem.\n          It\
    \ is not, however, guaranteed to be the shortest path to\n          diagnosis.\
    \  In some cases, a binary search on the problem\n          might be more effective\
    \ (i.e., try a test \"in the middle,\"\n          in a spot where the failure\
    \ modes are well defined).  In\n          other cases, available information might\
    \ so strongly suggest\n          a particular failure that immediately testing\
    \ for it is in\n          order.  This last \"approach,\" which might be called\
    \ \"hunting\n          and pecking,\" should be used with caution: chasing one\
    \ will\n          o' the wisp after another can waste much time and effort.\n\
    \          Note that line problems are still among the most common\n         \
    \ causes of connectivity loss.  Problems in transmission\n          across local\
    \ media are outside the scope of this tutorial.\n          But, if a host or workstation\
    \ loses or cannot establish con-\n          nectivity, check its physical connection.\n\
    \          3.3 Limited Connectivity\n          An interesting class of problems\
    \ can result in a particu-\n          larly mysterious failure: TELNET or other\
    \ low-volume TCP\n          connections work, but large file transfers fail. \
    \ FTP\n          transfers may start, but then hang.  There are several pos-\n\
    \          sible culprits in this problem.  The most likely suspects\n       \
    \   are IP implementations that cannot fragment or reassemble\n          datagrams,\
    \ and TCP implementations that do not perform\n          dynamic window sizing\
    \ (a.k.a. Van Jacobson's \"Slow Start\"\n          algorithm).  Another possibility\
    \ is mixing incompatible\n          frame formats on an ethernet.\n          Even\
    \ today, some IP implementations in the Internet cannot\n          correctly handle\
    \ fragmentation or reassembly.  They will\n          work fine for small packets,\
    \ but drop all large packets.\n          The problem can also be caused by buffer\
    \ exhaustion at gate-\n          ways that connect interfaces of widely differing\
    \ bandwidth.\n          Datagrams from a TCP connection that traverses a bottleneck\n\
    \          will experience queue delays, and will be dropped if buffer\n     \
    \     resources are depleted.  The congestion can be made worse if\n         \
    \ the TCP implementation at the traffic source does not use\n          the recommended\
    \ algorithms for computing retransmission\n          times, since spuriously retransmitted\
    \ datagrams will only\n          add to the congestion.* Fragmentation, even if\
    \ correctly\n          implemented, will compound this problem, since processing\n\
    \          delays and congestion will be increased at the bottleneck.\n      \
    \    Serial Line Internet Protocol (SLIP) links are especially\n          vulnerable\
    \ to this and other congestion problems.  SLIP\n          lines are typically\
    \ an order of magnitude slower than other\n          gateway interfaces.  Also,\
    \ the SLIP lines are at times con-\n          figured with MTUs (Maximum Transfer\
    \ Unit, the maximum length\n          of an IP datagram for a particular subnet)\
    \ as small as 256\n          _________________________\n          * To avoid this\
    \ problem, TCP implementations on the In-\n          ternet must use \"exponential\
    \ backoff\" between succes-\n          sive retransmissions, Karn's algorithm\
    \ for filtering\n          samples used to estimate round-trip delay between TCP\n\
    \          peers, and Jacobson's algorithm for incorporating vari-\n         \
    \ ance into the \"retransmission time-out\" computation for\n          TCP segments.\
    \  See Section 4.2.3.1 of RFC 1122, \"Re-\n          quirements for Internet Hosts\
    \ -- Communication Layers.\"\n          bytes, which virtually guarantees fragmentation.\n\
    \          To alleviate this problem, TCP implementations behind slow\n      \
    \    lines should advertise small windows.  Also, if possible,\n          SLIP\
    \ lines should be configured with an MTU no less than 576\n          bytes.  The\
    \ tradeoff to weigh is whether interactive traffic\n          will be penalized\
    \ too severly by transmission delays of\n          lengthy datagrams from concurrent\
    \ file transfers.\n          Misuse of ethernet trailers can also cause the problem\
    \ of\n          hanging file transfers.  \"Trailers\" refers to an ethernet\n\
    \          frame format optionally employed by BSD systems to minimize\n     \
    \     buffer copying by system software.  BSD systems with ether-\n          net\
    \ interfaces can be configured to send large frames so\n          that their address\
    \ and control data are at the end of a\n          frame (hence, a \"trailer\"\
    \ instead of a \"header\").  After a\n          memory page is allocated and loaded\
    \ with a received ethernet\n          frame, the ethernet data will begin at the\
    \ start of the\n          memory page boundary.  Hence, the ethernet control informa-\n\
    \          tion can be logically stripped from the end merely by\n          adjusting\
    \ the page's length field.  By manipulating virtual\n          memory mapping,\
    \ this same page (sans ethernet control infor-\n          mation), can then be\
    \ passed to the local IP module without\n          additional allocation and loading\
    \ of memory.  The disadvan-\n          tage in using trailers is that it is non-standard.\
    \  Many\n          implementations cannot parse trailers.\n          The hanging\
    \ FTP problem will appear if a gateway is not con-\n          figured to recognize\
    \ trailers, but a host or gateway immedi-\n          ately \"upstream\" on an\
    \ ethernet uses them.  Short datagrams\n          will not be formatted with trailers,\
    \ and so will be pro-\n          cessed correctly.  When the bulk data transfer\
    \ starts, how-\n          ever, full-sized frames will be sent, and will use the\n\
    \          trailer format.  To the gateway that receives them, they\n        \
    \  appear simply as misformatted frames, and are quietly\n          dropped. \
    \ The solution, obviously, is to insure that all\n          hosts and gateways\
    \ on an ethernet are consistent in their\n          use of trailers.  Note that\
    \ RFC 1122, \"Internet Host\n          Requirements,\" places very strict restrictions\
    \ on the use of\n          trailers.\n          4. Performance Testing\n     \
    \     Performance management encompasses two rather different\n          activities.\
    \  One is passive system monitoring to detect\n          problems and determine\
    \ operational baselines.  The goal is\n          to measure system and component\
    \ utilization and so locate\n          bottlenecks, since bottlenecks should receive\
    \ the focus of\n          performance tuning efforts.  Also, performance data\
    \ is usu-\n          ally required by upper level management to justify the costs\n\
    \          of communications systems.  This is essentially identical to\n    \
    \      system monitoring, and is addressed at greater length in\n          Section\
    \ 2, above.\n          Another aspect of performance management is active perfor-\n\
    \          mance testing and capacity planning.  Some work in this area\n    \
    \      can be based on analysis.  For example, a rough estimate of\n         \
    \ gateway capacity can be deduced from a simple model given by\n          Charles\
    \ Hedrick in his \"Introduction to Administration of an\n          Internet-based\
    \ Local Network,\" which is\n               per-packet processing time =\n   \
    \                      switching time +\n                                   (packet\
    \ size) * (transmission bps).\n          Another guideline for capacity planning\
    \ is that in order to\n          avoid excessive queuing delays, a system should\
    \ be sized at\n          about double its expected load.  In other words, system\n\
    \          capacity should be so high that utilization is no greater\n       \
    \   than 50%.\n          Although there are more sophisticated analytic models\
    \ of\n          communications systems than those above, their added com-\n  \
    \        plexity does not usually gain a corresponding accuracy.\n          Most\
    \ analytic models of communications nets require assump-\n          tions about\
    \ traffic load distributions and service rates\n          that are not merely\
    \ problematic, but are patently false.\n          These errors tend to result\
    \ in underestimating queuing\n          delays.  Hence, it is often necessary\
    \ to actually load and\n          measure the performance of a real communications\
    \ system if\n          one is to get accurate performance predictions.  Obviously,\n\
    \          this type of testing is performed on isolated systems or\n        \
    \  during off hours.  The results can be used to evaluate\n          parameter\
    \ settings or predict performance during normal\n          operations.\n     \
    \     Simulations can be used to supplement the testing of real\n          systems.\
    \  To be believable, however, simulations require\n          validation, which,\
    \ in turn, requires measurements from a\n          real system.  Whether testing\
    \ or simulating a system's per-\n          formance, actual traffic traces should\
    \ be incorporated as\n          input to traffic generators.  The performance\
    \ of a communi-\n          cations system will be greatly influenced by its load\n\
    \          characteristics (burstiness, volume, etc.), which are them-\n     \
    \     selves highly dependent on the applications that are run.\n          When\
    \ tuning a net, in addition to the usual configuration\n          parameters,\
    \ consider the impact of the location of gateways\n          and print and file\
    \ servers.  A few rules of thumb can guide\n          the location of shared system\
    \ resources.  First, there is\n          the principle of locality: a system will\
    \ perform better if\n          most traffic is between nearby destinations.  The\
    \ second\n          rule is to avoid creating bottlenecks.  For example, multi-\n\
    \          ple diskservers may be called for to support a large number\n     \
    \     of workstations.  Furthermore, to avoid LAN and diskserver\n          congestion,\
    \ workstations should be configured with enough\n          memory to avoid frequent\
    \ swapping.\n          As a final note on performance management, proceed cau-\n\
    \          tiously if your ethernet interface allows you to customize\n      \
    \    its collision recovery algorithm.  This is almost always a\n          bad\
    \ idea.  The best that it can accomplish is to give a few\n          favored hosts\
    \ a disproportionate share of the ethernet\n          bandwidth, perhaps at the\
    \ cost of a reduction in total sys-\n          tem throughput.  Worse, it is possible\
    \ that differing colli-\n          sion recovery algorithms may exhibit a self-synchronizing\n\
    \          behavior, so that excess collisions are generated.\n          5. Configuration\
    \ Management\n          Configuration management is the setting, collecting, and\n\
    \          storing of the state and parameters of network resources.\n       \
    \   It overlaps all other network management functions.  Hence,\n          some\
    \ aspects of configuration management have already been\n          addressed (e.g.,\
    \ tuning for performance).  In this section,\n          we will focus on configuration\
    \ management activities needed\n          to \"hook up\" a net or campus to a\
    \ larger internet.  We will\n          not, of course, include specific details\
    \ on installing or\n          maintaining internetted communications systems.\
    \  We will,\n          however, skim over some of the TCP/IP configuration\n \
    \         highlights.\n          Configuration management includes \"name management\"\
    \ -- the\n          control and allocation of system names and addresses, and\n\
    \          the translation between names and addresses.  Name-to-\n          address\
    \ translation is performed by \"name servers.\" We con-\n          clude this\
    \ section with a few strictures on the simultaneous\n          use of two automated\
    \ name-servers, the Domain Name System\n          (DNS), and Yellow Pages (YP).\n\
    \          5.1 Required Host Configuration Data for TCP/IP internets\n       \
    \   In a TCP/IP internet, each host needs several items of\n          information\
    \ for internet communications.  Some will be\n          host-specific, while other\
    \ information will be common for\n          all hosts on a subnet.  In a soon\
    \ to be published RFC docu-\n          ment,* R. Droms identifies the following\
    \ configuration data\n          required by internet hosts:\n               o\b\
    +    An IP address, a host specific value that can be\n                    hard-coded\
    \ or obtained via BOOTP, the Reverse\n                    Address Resolution Protocol\
    \ (RARP) or Dynamic RARP\n                    (DRARP).\n               o\b+  \
    \  Subnet properties, such as the subnet mask and the\n                    Maximum\
    \ Transmission Unit (MTU); obviously, these\n                    values are not\
    \ host-specific.\n               o\b+    Addresses of \"entry\" gateways to the\
    \ internet;\n                    addresses of default gateways are usually hard-\n\
    \                    coded; though the ICMP \"redirect\" message can be\n    \
    \                used to refine a host's routing tables, there is\n          \
    \          currently no dynamic TCP/IP mechanism or protocol\n               \
    \     for a host to locate a gateway; an IETF working\n                    group\
    \ is busy on this problem.\n               o\b+    For hosts in internets using\
    \ the Domain Name Sys-\n                    tem (DNS) for name-to-address translation,\
    \ the\n                    location of a local DNS server is needed; this\n  \
    \                  information is not host-specific, and usually\n           \

    \       * Draft \"Dynamic Configuration of Internet Hosts.\"\n          5.3 Connecting\
    \ to THE Internet\n          The original TCP/IP Internet (spelled with an upper-case\n\
    \          \"I\") is still active, and still growing.  An interesting\n      \
    \    aspect of the Internet is that it spans many independently\n          administered\
    \ systems.\n          Connection to the Internet requires: a registered network\n\
    \          number, for use in IP addresses; a registered autonomous\n        \
    \  system number (ASN), for use in internet routing; and, a\n          registered\
    \ domain name.  Fielding a primary and backup DNS\n          server is a condition\
    \ for registering a domain name.\n          The Defense Data Network (DDN) Network\
    \ Information Center\n          (NIC) is responsible for registering network numbers,\
    \ auto-\n          nomous system numbers, and domain names.  Regional nets will\n\
    \          have their own policies and requirements for Internet con-\n      \
    \    nections, but all use the NIC for this registration service.\n          Contact\

    \ (toll-free hotline)\n          5.4 YP and DNS: Dueling name servers.\n     \
    \     The Domain Name System (DNS) provides name service: it\n          translates\
    \ host names into IP addresses (this mapping is\n          also called \"resolution\"\
    ).  Two widespread DNS implementa-\n          tions are \"bind\" and \"named.\"\
    \  The Sun Yellow Pages (YP)\n          system can be configured to provide an\
    \ identical service, by\n          providing remote, keyed access to the \"hosts.byname\"\
    \ map.\n          Unfortunately, if both DNS and the YP hosts.byname map are\n\
    \          installed, they can interact in disruptive ways.\n          The problem\
    \ has been noted in systems in which DNS is used\n          as a fallback, to\
    \ resolve hostnames that YP cannot.  If DNS\n          is slow in responding,\
    \ the timeout in program ypserv may\n          expire, which triggers a repeated\
    \ request.  This can result\n          in disaster if DNS was initially slow because\
    \ of congestion:\n          the slower things get, the more requests are generated,\n\
    \          which slows things even more.  A symptom of this problem is\n     \
    \     that failures by the DNS server or network will trigger\n          numerous\
    \ requests to DNS.\n          Reportedly, the bug in YP that results in the avalanche\
    \ of\n          DNS requests has been repaired in SunOS 4.1.  The problem,\n \
    \         however, is more fundamental than an implementation error.\n       \
    \   The YP map hosts.byname and the DNS contain the same class\n          of information.\
    \  One can get an answer to the same query\n          from each system.  These\
    \ answers may well be different:\n          there is not a mechanism to maintain\
    \ consistency between the\n          systems.  More critical, however, is the\
    \ lack of a mechanism\n          or procedure to establish which system is authoritative.\n\
    \          Hence, running the DNS and YP name services in parallel is\n      \
    \    pointless.  If the systems stay consistent, then only one is\n          needed.\
    \  If they differ, there is no way to choose which is\n          correct.\n  \
    \        The YP hosts.byname service and DNS are comparable, but\n          incompatible.\
    \  If possible, a site should not run both ser-\n          vices.  Because of\
    \ Internet policy, sites with Internet con-\n          nections MUST use the DNS.\
    \  If YP is also used, then it\n          should be configured with YP-to-DNS\
    \ disabled.\n          Hacking a system so that it uses DNS rather than the YP\n\
    \          hosts.byname map is not trivial, and should not be attempted\n    \
    \      by novices.  The approach is to rebuild the shared C link-\n          library,\
    \ so that system calls to gethostbyname() and\n          gethostbyaddr() will\
    \ use DNS rather than YP.  To complete\n          the change, programs that do\
    \ not dynamically link the shared\n          C library (rcp, arp, etc.)  must\
    \ also be rebuilt.\n          Modified shared C libraries for Sun 3s and Sun 4s\
    \ are avail-\n          able via anonymous FTP from host uunet.uu.net, in the\
    \ sun-\n          fixes directory.  Note that use of DNS routines rather than\n\
    \          YP for general name resolution is not a supported SunOS\n         \
    \ feature at this time.\n          6. Internet Security\n          The guidelines\
    \ and advice in this section pertain to enhanc-\n          ing the protection\
    \ of data that are merely \"sensitive.\"  By\n          themselves, these measures\
    \ are insufficient for protecting\n          \"classified\" data.  Implementing\
    \ the policies required to\n          protect classified data is subject to stringent,\
    \ formal\n          review procedures, and is regulated by agencies such as the\n\
    \          Defense Investigative Service (DIS) and the National Secu-\n      \
    \    rity Agency (NSA).\n          A network manager must realize that he is responsible\
    \ for\n          protecting his system and its users.  Furthermore, though\n \
    \         the Internet may appear to be a grand example of a coopera-\n      \
    \    tive joint enterprise, recent incidents have made it clear\n          that\
    \ not all Internet denizens are benign.\n          A network manager should be\
    \ aware that the network services\n          he runs have a large impact on the\
    \ security risks to which\n          his system is exposed.  The prudent network\
    \ manager will be\n          very careful as to what services his site provides\
    \ to the\n          rest of the Internet, and what access restrictions are\n \
    \         enforced.  For example, the protocol \"finger\" may provide\n      \
    \    more information about a user than should be given to the\n          world\
    \ at large.  Worse, most implementations of the protocol\n          TFTP give\
    \ access to all world-readable files.\n          This section highlights several\
    \ basic security considera-\n          tions for Internet sites.  It then lists\
    \ several sources of\n          information and advice on improving the security\
    \ of systems\n          connected to the Internet.\n          6.1 Basic Internet\
    \ Security\n          Two major Internet security threats are denial of service\n\
    \          and unauthorized access.\n          Denial of service threats often\
    \ take the form of protocol\n          spoofers or other malicious traffic generators.\
    \  These prob-\n          lems can be detected through system monitoring logs.\
    \  If an\n          attack is suspected, immediately contact your regional net\n\
    \          office (e.g., SURANET, MILNET).  In addition, DDN users\n         \
    \ should contact SCC, while other Internet users should con-\n          tact CERT\
    \ (see below).  A cogent description of your\n          system's symptoms will\
    \ be needed.\n          At your own site, be prepared to isolate the problems\
    \ (e.g.,\n          by limiting disk space available to the message queue of a\n\
    \          mail system under attack).  As a last resort, coping with an\n    \
    \      attack may require taking down an Internet connection.  It\n          is\
    \ better, however, not to be too quick to quarantine your\n          site, since\
    \ information for coping with the attack may come\n          via the Internet.\n\
    \          Unauthorized access is a potentially more ominous security\n      \
    \    threat.  The main avenues are attacks against passwords and\n          attacks\
    \ against privileged system processes.\n          An appallingly common means\
    \ of gaining entry to systems is\n          by use of the initial passwords to\
    \ root, sysdiag, and other\n          management accounts that systems are shipped\
    \ with.  Only\n          slightly less vulnerable are common or trivial passwords,\n\
    \          since these are readily subverted by dictionary attacks.*\n       \
    \   Obvious steps can reduce the risk of password attacks: pass-\n          words\
    \ should be short-lived, at least eight characters long,\n          with a mix\
    \ of upper and lower case, and preferably random.\n          The distasteful aspect\
    \ of memorizing a random string can be\n          alleviated if the password is\
    \ pronounceable.\n          Improving passwords does not remove all risks.  Passwords\n\
    \          transmitted over an ethernet are visible to all attached\n        \
    \  systems.  Furthermore, gateways have the potential to inter-\n          cept\
    \ passwords used by any FTP or TELNET connections that\n          traverse them.\
    \  It is a bad idea for the root account to be\n          accessed by FTP or TELNET\
    \ if the connections must cross\n          untrusted elements.\n          Attacks\
    \ against system processes are another avenue of unau-\n          thorized access.\
    \  The principle is that by subverting a sys-\n          tem process, the attacker\
    \ can then gain its access\n          privileges.\n          One approach to reducing\
    \ this risk is to make system pro-\n          grams harder to subvert.  For example,\
    \ the widespread attack\n          in November 1988 by a self-replicating computer\
    \ program\n          (\"worm,\" analogous to a tapeworm) subverted the \"fingerd\"\
    \n          process, by loading an intrusive bootstrap program (known\n      \
    \    variously as a \"grappling hook\" or \"vector\" program), and\n         \
    \ then corrupting the stack space so that a subroutine's\n          return address\
    \ was overwritten with the address of the\n          bootstrap program.** The\
    \ security hole in fingerd consisted\n          of an input routine that did not\
    \ have a length check.  Secu-\n          rity fixes to \"fingerd\" include the\
    \ use of a revised input\n          routine.\n          A more general protection\
    \ is to apply the principle of\n          \"least privilege.\"  Where possible,\
    \ system routines should\n          run under separate user IDs, and should have\
    \ no more\n          privilege than is necessary for them to function.\n     \

    \     ** An early account of the Internet Worm incident of\n          November\
    \ 1988 is given by Eugene Spafford in the Janu-\n          ary 89 issue of \"\
    Computer Communications Review.\"\n          Several other articles on the worm\
    \ incident are in the\n          June 89 issue of the \"Communications of the\
    \ ACM.\"\n          To further protect against attacks on system processes, sys-\n\
    \          tem managers should regularly check their system programs to\n    \
    \      ensure that they have not been tampered with or modified in\n         \
    \ any way.  Checksums should be used for this purpose.  Using\n          the operating\
    \ system to check a file's last date of modifi-\n          cation is insufficient,\
    \ since the date itself can be\n          compromised.\n          Finally, to\
    \ avoid the unauthorized replacement of system\n          code, care should be\
    \ exercised in assigning protection to\n          its directory paths.\n     \
    \     Some system programs actually have \"trap doors\" that facili-\n       \
    \   tate subversion.  A trap door is the epitome of an undocu-\n          mented\
    \ feature: it is a hidden capability of a system pro-\n          gram that allows\
    \ a knowledgeable person to gain access to a\n          system.  The Internet\
    \ Worm exploited what was essentially a\n          trap door in the BSD sendmail\
    \ program.\n          Ensuring against trap doors in software as complex as send-\n\
    \          mail may be infeasible.  In an ideal world, the BSD sendmail\n    \
    \      program would be replaced by an entire mail subsystem (i.e.,\n        \
    \  perhaps including mail user agents, mail transfer agents,\n          and text\
    \ preparation and filing programs).  Any site using\n          sendmail should\
    \ at least obtain the less vulnerable,\n          toughened distribution from\
    \ ucbarpa.berkeley.edu, in file\n          ~ftp/4.3/sendmail.tar.Z.  Sites running\
    \ SunOS should note\n          that the 4.0.3 release closed the security holes\
    \ exploited\n          by the Internet Worm.  Fixes for a more obscure security\n\
    \          hole in SunOS are available from host uunet.uu.net in\n          ~ftp/sun-fixes;\
    \ these improvements have been incorporated in\n          SunOS 4.1.\n       \
    \   Sendmail has problems other than size and complexity.  Its\n          use\
    \ of root privileges, its approach to alias expansion, and\n          several\
    \ other design characteristics present potential ave-\n          nues of attack.\
    \  For UNIX sites, an alternative mail server\n          to consider is MMDF,\
    \ which is now at version 2.  MMDF is\n          distributed as part of the SCO\
    \ UNIX distribution, and is\n          also available in the user contributed\
    \ portion of 4.3BSD.\n          Though free, MMDF is licensed, and resale is restricted.\n\
    \          Sites running MMDF should be on the mmdf email list;\n          requests\
    \ to join this list should be sent to:\n               mmdf2-request@relay.cs.net.\n\
    \          Programs that masquerade as legitimate system code but which\n    \
    \      contain trap doors or other aides to unauthorized access are\n        \
    \  known as trojan horses.  Computer \"viruses,\" intrusive\n          software\
    \ that infects seemingly innocent programs and pro-\n          pagates when the\
    \ infected programs are executed or copied,\n          are a special case of trojan\
    \ horse programs.*\n          To guard against trojan horse attacks, be wary of\
    \ programs\n          downloaded from remote sources.  At minimum, do not download\n\
    \          executables from any but the most trusted sources.  Also, as\n    \
    \      noted above, to avoid proliferation of \"infected\" software,\n       \
    \   checksums should be computed, recorded, and periodically\n          verified.\n\
    \          6.2 Security Information Clearing-Houses\n          The Internet community\
    \ can get security assistance from the\n          Computer Emergency Response\
    \ Team (CERT), established by\n          DARPA in November 1988.  The Coordination\
    \ Center for the\n          CERT (CERT/CC) is located at the Software Engineering\
    \ Insti-\n          tute at Carnegie Mellon University.  The CERT is intended\
    \ to\n          respond to computer security threats such as the November\n  \

    \          CERT assists Internet sites in response to security attacks\n     \
    \     or other emergency situations.  It can immediately tap\n          experts\
    \ to diagnose and solve the problems, as well as\n          establish and maintain\
