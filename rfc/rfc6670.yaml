  - "1.  Introduction\n   The MPLS Transport Profile (MPLS-TP) is a profile of MPLS\
    \ technology\n   for use in transport network deployments.  Note that \"transport\"\
    \ in\n   this document is used in the context of transport networks as\n   discussed\
    \ in Section 1.3 of [RFC5654] and in [RFC5921].  The work on\n   MPLS-TP has extended\
    \ the MPLS toolset with additional architectural\n   elements and functions that\
    \ can be used in any MPLS deployment.\n   MPLS-TP is a set of functions and features\
    \ selected from the extended\n   MPLS toolset and applied in a consistent way\
    \ to meet the needs and\n   requirements of operators of packet transport networks.\n\
    \   Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM) plays a significant\n  \
    \ role in carrier networks, providing methods for fault management and\n   performance\
    \ monitoring in both the transport and service layers, and\n   enabling these\
    \ layers to support services with guaranteed and strict\n   Service Level Agreements\
    \ (SLAs) while reducing their operational\n   costs.\n   OAM provides a comprehensive\
    \ set of capabilities that operate in the\n   data plane.  Network-oriented mechanisms\
    \ are used to monitor the\n   network's infrastructure in order to enhance the\
    \ network's general\n   behavior and level of performance.  Service-oriented mechanisms\
    \ are\n   used to monitor the services offered to end customers.  Such\n   mechanisms\
    \ enable rapid response to a failure event and facilitate\n   the verification\
    \ of some SLA parameters.  Fault management mechanisms\n   are used for fault\
    \ detection and localization as well as for\n   diagnostics and notification.\
    \  Performance management mechanisms\n   enable monitoring of the quality of service\
    \ with regard to key SLA\n   criteria (e.g., jitter, latency, and packet loss).\n\
    \   During the process of development of MPLS-TP, additions to the MPLS\n   toolset\
    \ have been made to ensure that the tools available meet the\n   requirements.\
    \  These additions were motivated by MPLS-TP, but form\n   part of the wider MPLS\
    \ toolset, such that any of them could be used\n   in any MPLS deployment.\n \
    \  One major set of additions provides enhanced support for OAM.  Many\n   solutions\
    \ and protocol extensions have been proposed to address these\n   OAM requirements.\
    \  This document sets out the reasons for selecting a\n   single, coherent set\
    \ of OAM solutions for standardization.\n   The content of this document should\
    \ be read in the context of\n   [RFC1958].  In particular, Section 3.2 of [RFC1958]\
    \ says:\n      If there are several ways of doing the same thing, choose one.\
    \  If\n      a previous design, in the Internet context or elsewhere, has\n  \
    \    successfully solved the same problem, choose the same solution\n      unless\
    \ there is a good technical reason not to.  Duplication of\n      the same protocol\
    \ functionality should be avoided as far as\n      possible, without of course\
    \ using this argument to reject\n      improvements.\n"
- title: 1.1.  Background
  contents:
  - "1.1.  Background\n   The ITU-T and the IETF jointly commissioned a Joint Working\
    \ Team\n   (JWT) to examine the feasibility of a collaborative solution to\n \
    \  support OAM requirements for MPLS transport networks known as the\n   MPLS\
    \ Transport Profile (MPLS-TP).  The JWT reported that it is\n   possible to extend\
    \ the MPLS technology to fully satisfy the\n   requirements [RFC5317].  The investigation\
    \ by the JWT laid the\n   foundations for the work to extend MPLS, but a thorough\
    \ technical\n   analysis was subsequently carried out within the IETF with strong\n\
    \   input from the ITU-T to ensure that the MPLS-TP OAM requirements\n   provided\
    \ by the ITU-T and the IETF would be met.\n   The report of the JWT [RFC5317]\
    \ as accepted by the ITU-T was\n   documented in [TD7] and was communicated to\
    \ the IETF in a liaison\n   statement [LS26].  In particular, the ITU-T stated\
    \ that any\n   extensions to MPLS technology will be progressed via the IETF\n\
    \   standards process using the procedures defined in [RFC4929].\n   [RFC5317]\
    \ includes the analysis that \"it is technically feasible that\n   the existing\
    \ MPLS architecture can be extended to meet the\n   requirements of a Transport\
    \ profile, and that the architecture allows\n   for a single OAM technology for\
    \ LSPs, PWs, and a deeply nested\n   network\".  This provided a starting point\
    \ for the work on MPLS-TP.\n   [RFC5654] in general, and [RFC5860] in particular,\
    \ define a set of\n   requirements for OAM functionality in MPLS-TP that are applicable\
    \ to\n   MPLS-TP Label Switched Paths (LSPs), Pseudowires (PWs), and MPLS-TP\n\
    \   links.  These documents are the results of a joint effort by the\n   ITU-T\
    \ and the IETF to include an MPLS Transport Profile within the\n   IETF MPLS and\
    \ Pseudowire Emulation Edge-to-Edge (PWE3) architectures\n   to enable the deployment\
    \ of a packet transport network that supports\n   the capabilities and functionalities\
    \ of a transport network as\n   defined by the ITU-T.  The OAM requirements are\
    \ derived from those\n   specified by the ITU-T in [Y.Sup4].\n   An analysis of\
    \ the technical options for OAM solutions was carried\n   out by a design team\
    \ (the MEAD team) consisting of experts from both\n   the ITU-T and the IETF.\
    \  The team reached an agreement on the\n   principles of the design and the direction\
    \ for the development of an\n   MPLS-TP OAM toolset.  A report was subsequently\
    \ submitted to the IETF\n   MPLS working group at the Stockholm IETF meeting in\
    \ July 2009\n   [DesignReport].  The guidelines drawn up by the design team have\n\
    \   played an important role in the creation of a coherent MPLS-TP OAM\n   solution.\n\
    \   The MPLS working group has modularized the function of MPLS-TP OAM,\n   allowing\
    \ for separate and prioritized development of solutions.  This\n   has given rise\
    \ to a number of documents each describing a different\n   part of the solution\
    \ toolset.  At the time of this writing, the most\n   important of these documents\
    \ have completed development within the\n   MPLS working group and are advancing\
    \ through the IETF process toward\n   publication as RFCs.  These documents cover\
    \ the following OAM\n   features:\n   o  Continuity Check\n   o  Connection Verification\n\
    \   o  On-Demand Connection Verification\n   o  Route Tracing\n   o  Remote Defect\
    \ Indication\n   o  Packet Loss Measurement\n   o  Packet Delay Measurement\n\
    \   o  Lock Instruction\n   o  Loopback Testing\n   o  Fault Management\n   The\
    \ standardization process within the IETF allows for the continued\n   analysis\
    \ of whether the OAM solutions under development meet the\n   documented requirements,\
    \ and facilitates the addition of new\n   requirements if any are discovered.\
    \  It is not the purpose of this\n   document to analyze the correctness of the\
    \ selection of specific OAM\n   solutions.  This document is intended to explain\
    \ why it would be\n   unwise to standardize multiple solutions for MPLS-TP OAM,\
    \ and to show\n   how the existence of multiple solutions would complicate MPLS-TP\n\
    \   development and deployment, making networks more expensive to build,\n   less\
    \ stable, and more costly to operate.\n"
- title: 1.2.  The Development of a Parallel MPLS-TP OAM Solution
  contents:
  - "1.2.  The Development of a Parallel MPLS-TP OAM Solution\n   It has been suggested\
    \ that a second (i.e., different) OAM solution\n   should also be developed and\
    \ documented in an ITU-T Recommendation.\n   Various arguments have been presented\
    \ for this duplication of effort,\n   including the following:\n   o  Similarity\
    \ to OAM encodings and mechanisms used in Ethernet.\n   o  The existence of two\
    \ distinct MPLS-TP deployment environments:\n      Packet Switched Networks (PSNs)\
    \ and Packet Transport Networks\n      (PTNs).\n   o  The need for similar operational\
    \ experience in MPLS-TP networks\n      and in pre-existing transport networks\
    \ (especially Synchronous\n      Optical Network/Synchronous Digital Hierarchy\
    \ (SONET/SDH)\n      networks).\n   The first of these was discussed within the\
    \ IETF's MPLS working group\n   where precedence was given to adherence to the\
    \ JWT's recommendation\n   to select a solution that reused as far as possible\
    \ pre-existing MPLS\n   tools.  Additionally, it was decided that consistency\
    \ with encodings\n   and mechanisms used in MPLS was of greater importance.\n\
    \   The second argument has not been examined in great detail because\n   substantive\
    \ evidence of the existence of two deployment environments\n   has not been documented\
    \ or presented.  Indeed, one of the key\n   differences cited between the two\
    \ allegedly distinct environments is\n   the choice of MPLS-TP OAM solution, which\
    \ makes a circular argument.\n   The third argument contains a very important\
    \ point: network operators\n   want to achieve a smooth migration from legacy\
    \ technologies such as\n   SONET/SDH to their new packet transport networks. \
    \ This transition\n   can be eased if the new networks offer similar OAM features\
    \ and can\n   be managed using tools with similar look and feel.  The requirements\n\
    \   specifications [RFC5654] and [RFC5860] capture the essential issues\n   that\
    \ must be resolved to allow the same look and feel to be achieved.\n   Since the\
    \ OAM solutions developed within the IETF meet the documented\n   requirements,\
    \ Network Management Systems (NMSs) can easily be built\n   to give the same type\
    \ of control of MPLS-TP networks as is seen in\n   other transport networks. \
    \ Indeed, it should be understood that the\n   construction of an NMS is not dependent\
    \ on the protocols and packet\n   formats within the OAM but on the high-level\
    \ features and functions\n   offered by the OAM.\n   This document does not debate\
    \ the technical merits of any specific\n   solution.  That discussion, and the\
    \ documentation of MPLS-TP OAM\n   specifications, was delegated by the IETF and\
    \ ITU-T to the MPLS\n   working group and can be conducted using the normal consensus-driven\n\
    \   IETF process.  [OAM-OVERVIEW] presents an overview of the OAM\n   mechanisms\
    \ that have already been defined and that are currently\n   being defined by the\
    \ IETF, as well as a comparison with other OAM\n   mechanisms that were defined\
    \ by the IEEE and ITU-T.\n   This document focuses on an examination of the consequences\
    \ of the\n   existence of two MPLS-TP OAM solutions.\n"

- title: 3.1.  MPLS-TP Is an MPLS Technology
  contents:
  - "3.1.  MPLS-TP Is an MPLS Technology\n   MPLS-TP is an MPLS technology.  It is\
    \ designed to apply MPLS to a new\n   application.  The original proposers of\
    \ the concept assumed that the\n   transport variant of MPLS would always exist\
    \ in a disjoint network,\n   and indeed their first attempt at the technology\
    \ (Transport MPLS\n   (T-MPLS)) had a number of significant incompatibilities\
    \ with MPLS\n   that were irreconcilable.  When it was established that coexistence\n\
    \   in the same layer network could and would occur, T-MPLS development\n   was\
    \ stopped and the development of MPLS-TP was begun.  In MPLS-TP,\n   MPLS was\
    \ extended to satisfy the transport network requirements in a\n   way that was\
    \ compatible both with MPLS as has already been deployed,\n   and with MPLS as\
    \ the IETF envisioned it would develop in the future.\n   Given this intention\
    \ for compatibility, it follows that the MPLS-TP\n   OAM protocols should be designed\
    \ according to the design philosophies\n   that were applied for the existing\
    \ deployed MPLS OAM and that have\n   led to the current widespread adoption of\
    \ MPLS.  Key elements here\n   are scalability and hardware independence, i.e.,\
    \ that the trade-off\n   between scaling to large numbers of monitored objects\
    \ and the\n   performance of the monitoring system should be a matter for vendors\n\
    \   and operators to resolve, and that the trade-off should be a soft\n   transition\
    \ rather than an abrupt one.  Furthermore, there should be\n   no requirement\
    \ to execute any component (other than packet\n   forwarding) in hardware to achieve\
    \ usable performance.\n"
- title: 3.2.  MPLS-TP Is a Convergence Technology
  contents:
  - "3.2.  MPLS-TP Is a Convergence Technology\n   It is possible to argue that using\
    \ MPLS for transport is only a\n   stepping stone in the middle of a longer transition.\
    \  Quite clearly,\n   all communication applications are being moved to operate\
    \ over the\n   Internet protocol stack of TCP/IP/MPLS, and the various layers\
    \ that\n   have existed in communications networks are gradually being collapsed\n\
    \   into the minimum necessary set of layers.  Thus, for example, we no\n   longer\
    \ run IP over X.25 over High-Level Data Link Control (HDLC) over\n   multi-layered\
    \ Time Division Multiplexing (TDM) networks.\n   Increasingly, the entire point\
    \ of transport networks is to support\n   the transmission of TCP/IP/MPLS.  Using\
    \ MPLS to construct a transport\n   network may be a relatively short-term stepping\
    \ stone toward running\n   IP and MPLS directly over fiber optics.  MPLS has been\
    \ deployed in\n   operational networks for approximately a decade, and the existing\n\
    \   MPLS OAM techniques have seen wide deployment.  Service providers are\n  \
    \ not going to stop using the MPLS-based OAM techniques that they have\n   been\
    \ using for years, and no one has proposed that they would.  Thus,\n   the question\
    \ is not which OAM to use for transport networks; the\n   question is whether\
    \ service providers want to use two different sets\n   of OAM tools in the future\
    \ converged network.  If we arrive at a\n   destination where TCP/IP/MPLS runs\
    \ directly over fiber, the operators\n   will use MPLS OAM tools to make this\
    \ work.\n"
- title: 3.3.  There Is an End-to-End Requirement for OAM
  contents:
  - "3.3.  There Is an End-to-End Requirement for OAM\n   The purpose of OAM is usually\
    \ to execute a function that operates end\n   to end on the monitored object (such\
    \ as an LSP or PW).  Since LSPs\n   and PWs provide edge-to-edge connectivity\
    \ and can cross network\n   operator boundaries, the OAM must similarly operate\
    \ across network\n   operator boundaries.  This is particularly the case with\
    \ the\n   continuity check and connection verification functions that are\n  \
    \ needed to test the end-to-end connectivity of LSPs and PWs.  It is,\n   therefore,\
    \ necessary that any two pieces of equipment that could ever\n   be a part of\
    \ an end-to-end communications path have a common OAM.\n   This necessity is emphasized\
    \ in the case of equipment executing an\n   edge function, since with a global\
    \ technology such as MPLS it could\n   be interconnected with edge equipment deployed\
    \ by any other operator\n   in any part of the global network.\n   This leads\
    \ to the conclusion that it is desirable for any network-\n   layer protocol in\
    \ all equipment to be able to execute or to interwork\n   with a canonical form\
    \ of the OAM.  As discussed in Section 4,\n   interworking between protocols adds\
    \ significant complexity; thus, a\n   single default OAM is strongly preferred.\n"
- title: 3.4.  The Complexity Sausage
  contents:
  - "3.4.  The Complexity Sausage\n   A frequent driver for the replacement of an\
    \ established technology is\n   a perception that the new technology is simpler\
    \ and thus of greater\n   economic benefit to the user.  In an isolated system,\
    \ this may be the\n   case; however, as is usually the case with communications\n\
    \   technologies, simplification in one element of the system introduces\n   an\

  - "3.5.  Interworking Is Expensive and Has Deployment Issues\n   The issue of OAM\
    \ interworking can easily be illustrated by\n   considering an analogy with people\
    \ speaking different languages.\n   Interworking is achieved through the use of\
    \ an interpreter.  The\n   interpreter introduces cost, slows down the rate of\
    \ information\n   exchange, and may require transition through an intermediate\n\
    \   language.  There is considerable risk of translation errors and\n   semantic\
    \ ambiguities.  These considerations also apply to computer\n   protocols, particularly\
    \ given the ultra-pedantic nature of such\n   systems.  In all cases, the availability\
    \ of a single working language\n   dramatically simplifies the system, reduces\
    \ cost, and speeds reliable\n   communication.\n   If two MPLS OAM protocols were\
    \ to be deployed, we would have to\n   consider three possible scenarios:\n  \
    \ 1.  Isolation of the network into two incompatible and unconnected\n       islands.\n\
    \   2.  Universal use of both OAM protocols.\n   3.  Placement of interworking\
    \ (translation) functions or gateways.\n   We have many existence proofs that\
    \ isolation is not a viable\n   approach, and the reader is referred to the early\
    \ T-MPLS discussions\n   for examples.  In summary, the purpose of the Internet\
    \ is to achieve\n   an integrated universal connectivity.  Partition of the Internet\
    \ into\n   incompatible and unconnected islands is neither desirable nor\n   acceptable.\n\
    \   Universal deployment of both OAM protocols requires the sum of the\n   costs\
    \ associated with each protocol.  This manifests as\n   implementation time, development\
    \ costs, memory requirements, hardware\n   components, and management systems.\
    \  It introduces additional testing\n   requirements to ensure there are no conflicts\
    \ (processing state,\n   fault detection, code path, etc.) when both protocols\
    \ are run on a\n   common platform.  It also requires code and the processes to\
    \ deal\n   with the negotiation of which protocol to use and to deal with\n  \
    \ conflict resolution (which may be remote and multi-party) when an\n   inconsistent\
    \ choice is made.  In short, this option results in more\n   than double the cost,\
    \ increases the complexity of the resulting\n   system, risks the stability of\
    \ the deployed network, and makes the\n   networks more expensive and more complicated\
    \ to operate.\n   The third possibility is the use of some form of interworking\n\
    \   function.  This is not a simple solution and inevitably leads to cost\n  \
    \ and complexity in implementation, deployment, and operation.  Where\n   there\
    \ is a chain of communication (end-to-end messages passed through\n   a series\
    \ of transit nodes), a choice must be made about where to\n   apply the translation\
    \ and interworking.\n   o  In a layered architecture, interworking can be achieved\
    \ through\n      tunneling with the translation points at the end-points of the\n\
    \      tunnels.  In simple network diagrams, this can look very\n      appealing,\
    \ and only one end-node is required to be able to perform\n      the translation\
    \ function (effectively speaking both OAM\n      languages).  But in the more\
    \ complex reality of the Internet,\n      nearly every network node performs the\
    \ function of an end-node,\n      and so the result is that nearly every node\
    \ must be implemented\n      with the capability to handle both OAM protocols\
    \ and to translate\n      between them.  This turns out to be even more complex\
    \ than the\n      universal deployment of both protocols discussed above.\n  \
    \ o  In a flat architecture, interworking is performed at a \"gateway\"\n    \
    \  between islands implementing different protocols.  Gateways are\n      substantially\
    \ complex entities that usually have to maintain\n      end-to-end state within\
    \ the network (something that is against one\n      of the fundamental design\
    \ principles of the Internet) and must\n      bridge the differences in state\
    \ machines, message formats, and\n      information elements in the two protocols.\
    \  The complexity of\n      gateways makes them expensive, fragile, and unstable;\
    \ hard to\n      update when new revisions of protocols are released; and difficult\n\
    \      to manage.\n   To deploy an interworking function, it is necessary to determine\n\
    \   whether the OAM protocol on the arriving segment of the OAM is\n   identical\
    \ to the OAM protocol on the departing segment.  Where the\n   protocols are not\
    \ the same, it is necessary to determine which party\n   will perform the translation.\
    \  It is then necessary to route the LSP\n   or PW through a translation point\
    \ that has sufficient translation\n   capacity and sufficient data bandwidth,\
    \ as well as adequate path\n   diversity.  When an upgraded OAM function is required,\
    \ the problem\n   changes from a two-party negotiation to an n-party negotiation\
    \ with\n   commercial and deployment issues added to the mix.\n   Note that when\
    \ an end-to-end LSP or PW is deployed, it may transit\n   many networks, and the\
    \ OAM might require repeated translation back\n   and forth between the OAM protocols.\
    \  The consequent loss of\n   information and potential for error is similar to\
    \ the children's game\n   of \"telephone\".\n"

  - "3.6.  Selection of a Single OAM Solution When There Is a Choice\n   When there\

    \ must make a choice.  Choice can be a good thing when\n   it provides for selection\
    \ between different features and functions,\n   but it is a burden when the protocols\
    \ offer essentially the same\n   functions but are incompatible.\n   In this case,\
    \ the elements of the choice include the following:\n   o  Which protocol will\
    \ continue to be developed by its Standards\n      Development Organization (SDO)?\n\
    \   o  Which protocol is most stable in implementations?\n   o  How does a network\
    \ operator test and evaluate the two protocols?\n   o  Which vendors support and\
    \ will continue to support which protocol?\n   o  What equipment from different\
    \ vendors is compatible?\n   o  Which management tools support which protocols?\n\
    \   o  What protocols are supported by peer operators, and what\n      interworking\

    \ accomplished?\n   o  How does a network operator future-proof against the inclusion\
    \ of\n      new functions in the network?\n   At the very least, the evaluation\
    \ of these questions constitutes a\n   cost and introduces delay for the operator.\
    \  The consequence of a\n   wrong choice could be very expensive, and it is likely\
    \ that any\n   comparative testing will more than double the lab-test costs prior\
    \ to\n   deployment.\n   From a vendor's perspective, the choice is even harder.\
    \  A vendor\n   does not want to risk not offering a product for which there is\n\
    \   considerable demand, so both protocols may need to be developed,\n   leading\
    \ to more than doubled development costs.  Indeed, code\n   complexity and defect\
    \ rates have often been shown to increase more\n   than linearly with code size,\
    \ and (as noted in Section 3.5) the need\n   to test for coexistence and interaction\
    \ between the protocols adds to\n   the cost and complexity.\n   It should be\
    \ noted that, in the long run, it is the end-users who pay\n   the price for the\
    \ additional development costs and any network\n   instability that arises.\n"
- title: 3.7.   Migration Issues
  contents:
  - "3.7.   Migration Issues\n   Deployment of a technology that is subsequently replaced\
    \ or obsoleted\n   often leads to the need to migrate from one technology to another.\n\
    \   Such a situation might arise if an operator deploys one of the two\n   OAM\
    \ protocol solutions and discovers that he needs to migrate to the\n   other one.\
    \  A specific case would be when two operators merge their\n   networks but are\
    \ using different OAM solutions.\n   When the migration is between versions of\
    \ a protocol, it may be that\n   the new version is defined to support the old\
    \ version.  If the\n   implementation is in software (including FPGAs), upgrades\
    \ can be\n   managed centrally.  However, neither of these would be the case with\n\
    \   MPLS-TP OAM mechanisms, and hardware components would need to be\n   upgraded\
    \ in the field using expensive call-out services.\n   Hardware upgrades are likely\
    \ to affect service, even with\n   sophisticated devices with redundant hardware\
    \ components.\n   Furthermore, since it would be impractical to upgrade every\

    \  significantly large maintenance period across the whole network or\n   for\
    \ a rolling plan that involves upgrading nodes one at a time with\n   new hardware\
    \ that has dual capabilities.  Such hardware is, of\n   course, more expensive\
    \ and more complex to configure than hardware\n   dedicated to just one OAM protocol.\n\
    \   Additionally, the transition phase of migration leads to dual-mode\n   networks\

    \ was the case\n   with the original T-MPLS, where MPLS labels that could be used\
    \ for\n   data in a native MPLS system were assigned special meaning in T-MPLS\n\
    \   such that data packets would be intercepted and mistaken for OAM\n   packets.\n\
    \   A lesser incompatibility arises where the packets of one protocol are\n  \
    \ recognized as \"unknown\" or \"not valid\" by implementations of the\n   other\
    \ protocol.  In this case, the rules of one protocol require that\n   the packets\
    \ of the other protocol be discarded and may result in the\n   LSP or PW being\
    \ torn down.\n   The least serious level of incompatibility is where the packets\
    \ of\n   one protocol are recognized as \"unknown\" by implementations of the\n\
    \   other protocol, but where the rules of one protocol allow the packets\n  \
    \ of the other protocol to be ignored; in this case, such packets are\n   either\
    \ silently discarded or forwarded untouched.\n   These are issues with all of\

- title: 4.3.2.1.  Islands in a Sea
  contents:
  - "4.3.2.1.  Islands in a Sea\n   One way to view clusters of nodes supporting one\
    \ OAM protocol is as\n   an island in a sea of nodes supporting the other protocol.\
    \  In this\n   view, tunnels are used to carry LSPs or PWs using one OAM type\
    \ across\n   the sea and into another island of a compatible OAM type.  The tunnel\n\
    \   in this case is an LSP utilizing the OAM protocol supported by the\n   nodes\
    \ in the sea.  Theoretically, an island can be as small as one\n   node, and the\
    \ strait between two islands can be as narrow as just\n   one node.\n   Layering\
    \ in this way is an elegant solution to operating two\n   protocols simultaneously\
    \ and is, of course, used to support different\n   technologies (such as MPLS\
    \ over optical).  However, in such layering\n   deployments, there is no simple\
    \ integration of OAM between the\n   layers, and the OAM in the upper layer must\
    \ regard the tunnel as a\n   single hop with no visibility into the OAM of the\
    \ lower layer.\n   Diagnostics within the upper layer are complicated by this\
    \ \"hiding\"\n   of the nodes along the path of the tunnel in the lower layer.\n\
    \   In the scenarios described so far, both ends of each connection have\n   been\
    \ placed in islands of compatible OAM types.  It is possible to\n   achieve connectivity\
    \ between a node in an island and a node in the\n   sea if the end-point in the\
    \ sea has dual capabilities (i.e., can be\n   viewed as a single-node island).\n\
    \   A number of islands may lie along the path between end-points,\n   necessitating\
    \ the use of more than one tunnel.  To further complicate\n   matters, the islands\
    \ may lie in an inland sea so that it is necessary\n   to nest tunnels.\n   Regardless\
    \ of the scenario, operating such tunnels/layers adds to the\n   management complexity\
    \ and expense.  Furthermore, it should be noted\n   that in an MPLS network there\
    \ is often a call for any-to-any\n   connectivity.  That is, any node in the network\
    \ may need to establish\n   an LSP or a PW to any other node in the network. \
    \ As previously\n   noted, the end-points of any LSP or PW must support the same\
    \ OAM type\n   in the islands-in-a-sea model, so this tends to imply that all,\
    \ or\n   nearly all, nodes will end up needing to support both OAM protocols.\n\
    \   The use of tunnels can also degrade network services unless carefully\n  \
    \ coordinated.  For example, a service in the upper layer may be\n   provisioned\
    \ with protection so that a working and backup path is\n   constructed using diverse\
    \ paths to make them robust against a single\n   failure.  However, the paths\
    \ of the tunnels (in the lower layer) are\n   not visible to the path computation\
    \ in the upper layer, with the risk\n   that the upper layer working and protection\
    \ paths share a single\n   point of failure in the lower layer.  Traffic engineering\
    \ techniques\n   have been developed to resolve this type of issue, but they add\n\
    \   significant complexity to a system that would be a simple flat\n   network\
    \ if only one OAM technology was used.\n"

  contents:
  - "5.1.  Progress of the IETF Solution\n   The MPLS-TP OAM work carried out within\
    \ the IETF is the product of\n   joint work within the IETF and ITU-T communities.\
    \  That is, all\n   interested parties share the responsibility for progressing\
    \ this work\n   as quickly as possible.  Since the work is contribution-driven,\
    \ there\n   is no reason to assume that consensus on the technical content of\

    \ second solution seems certain to increase\n   the workload and will only slow\
    \ down the speed at which consensus is\n   reached.\n   The core work on MPLS-TP\
    \ OAM within the IETF was completed, and the\n   specifications were published\
    \ as RFCs.  For more information, see\n   [ISOCAnnounce].\n"
- title: 5.2.  Commonality with Ethernet OAM
  contents:
  - "5.2.  Commonality with Ethernet OAM\n   Ethernet can be used to build packet\
    \ transport networks, and so there\n   is an argument that Ethernet and MPLS-TP\
    \ networks will be operated as\n   peers.  Examining the issues of end-to-end\
    \ connections across mixed\n   networks, many of the same issues as those discussed\
    \ in Section 4\n   arise.  If a peer networking gateway model (see Section 4.3.2.2)\
    \ is\n   applied, there is a strong argument for making the OAM technologies\n\
    \   as similar as possible.\n   While this might be a valid discussion point when\
    \ selecting the\n   single OAM solution for MPLS-TP, it is countered by the need\
    \ to\n   achieve OAM consistency between MPLS and MPLS-TP networks.  One might\n\
    \   make the counter-argument that if there is a strong need to make\n   MPLS-TP\
    \ as similar as possible to Ethernet, it would be better to go\n   the full distance\
    \ and simply deploy Ethernet.\n   Furthermore, the approach of a second MPLS-TP\
    \ OAM protocol does not\n   resolve anything.  Since MPLS-TP is not Ethernet,\
    \ a gateway will\n   still be needed.  This would constitute a second MPLS-TP\
    \ OAM, so\n   additional gateways or interworking functions will be needed because\n\
    \   coexistence is inevitable, as described in the rest of this document.\n  \
    \ Additionally, it may be claimed that implementation can be simplified\n   if\
    \ the OAM solution developed for MPLS-TP is similar to Ethernet OAM.\n   This\
    \ would apply both in the hardware/software implementing the OAM,\n   and at the\
    \ server-to-client interface where OAM-induced fault status\n   is reported. \
    \ The questions here are very much implementation\n   dependent, as the necessary\
    \ function is contained within individual\n   nodes.  The counter-argument is\
    \ that implementation simplicity can\n   also be achieved by making MPLS-TP OAM\
    \ similar to MPLS OAM,\n   especially since the client technology may well be\
    \ IP/MPLS and since\n   MPLS is an end-to-end technology.\n"
- title: 5.3.  Different Application Scenarios
  contents:
  - "5.3.  Different Application Scenarios\n   It has been suggested that two different\
    \ applications of MPLS-TP\n   exist: Packet Switched Networks (PSNs) and Packet\
    \ Transport Networks\n   (PTNs).  These applications have not been documented\
    \ in the IETF, and\n   most of the support for this idea has been documented by\
    \ the ITU-T\n   [TD522].\n   One of the stated differences between these applications\
    \ lies in the\n   OAM tools that are required to support the distinct operational\n\
    \   scenarios.  The OAM used in a PSN should be similar to that used in\n   an\
    \ MPLS network (and so should be the MPLS-TP OAM defined in the\n   IETF), while\
    \ the OAM used in a PTN should provide the same\n   operational experience as\
    \ that found in SONET/SDH and Optical\n   Transport Networks (OTNs).\n   The basic\
    \ MPLS-TP OAM requirements in [RFC5654] make this point as\n   follows:\n    \
    \  Furthermore, for carriers it is important that operation of such\n      packet\
    \ transport networks should preserve the look-and-feel to\n      which carriers\
    \ have become accustomed in deploying their optical\n      transport networks,\
    \ while providing common, multi-layer\n      operations, resiliency, control,\
    \ and multi-technology management.\n   Thus, the look and feel of the OAM has\
    \ been a concern in the design\n   of MPLS-TP from the start, and the solutions\
    \ that have been defined\n   in the IETF were designed to comply with the requirements\
    \ and to\n   provide operational behavior, functionality, and processes similar\
    \ to\n   those available in existing transport networks.  In particular, the\n\
    \   toolset supports the same controls and indications as those present\n   in\
    \ other transport networks, and the same management information\n   model can\
    \ be used to support the MPLS-TP OAM tools (in areas where\n   the technology\
    \ type is irrelevant).\n   It is important to note that the operational look and\
    \ feel does not\n   determine the way in which OAM function is achieved.  There\
    \ are\n   multiple ways of achieving the required functionality while still\n\
    \   providing the same operational experience and supporting the same\n   management\
    \ information model.  Thus, the OAM protocol solution does\n   not dictate the\
    \ look and feel, and the demand for a particular\n   operational experience does\
    \ not necessitate the development of a\n   second OAM protocol.\n"
- title: 5.4.  Interaction between Solutions
  contents:
  - "5.4.  Interaction between Solutions\n   Section 3 of this document discusses\
    \ how network convergence occurs\n   and indicates that where two MPLS-TP solutions\
    \ exist, they are in\n   fact very likely to appear either in the same network\
    \ or at gateways\n   between networks in order to provide end-to-end OAM functionality.\n\
    \   Indeed, since nodes offering either solution are likely to both be\n   branded\
    \ as \"MPLS-TP\", and since network interoperation (as described\n   in Section\
    \ 4) demands the existence of some nodes that are either\n   dual-mode or act\
    \ as protocol translators/gateways, there is\n   considerable likelihood of the\
    \ two OAM solutions interacting through\n   design or through accident.  When\
    \ a node is capable of supporting\n   both OAM protocols, it must be configured\
    \ to support the correct\n   protocol for each interface and LSP/PW.  When a device\
    \ has interfaces\n   that offer different MPLS-TP OAM functions, the risk of\n\
    \   misconfiguration is significant.  When a device is intended to\n   support\
    \ end-to-end connections, it may need to translate, map, or\n   tunnel to accommodate\
    \ both protocols.\n   Thus, the very existence of two OAM protocols within the\
    \ common\n   MPLS-TP family makes copresence and integration most likely.\n"
- title: 5.5.  Letting the Market Decide
  contents:
  - "5.5.  Letting the Market Decide\n   When two technologies compete, it is common\
    \ to let the market decide\n   which one will survive.  Sometimes the resolution\
    \ is quite fast, and\n   one technology dominates the other before there is widespread\n\
    \   deployment.  Sometimes it takes considerable time before one\n   technology\
    \ overcomes the other, perhaps because one technology has\n   become entrenched\
    \ before the emergence of the other, as in the case\n   of MPLS replacing ATM.\
    \  In more cases, however, the market does not\n   select in favor of one technology\
    \ or the other -- as in many of the\n   cases described in Sections 4 and 5 of\
    \ this document, sometimes both\n   technologies continue to live in the network.\n\
    \   Letting the market decide is not a cheap option.  Even when the\n   resolution\
    \ is rapid, equipment vendors and early adopters pay the\n   price of both technologies.\
    \  When it takes longer to determine which\n   technology is correct, there will\
    \ be a period of coexistence followed\n   by the need to transition equipment\
    \ from the losing solution to the\n   winning one.  In the cases where no choice\
    \ is made, the network is\n   permanently complicated by the existence of the\
    \ competing\n   technologies.\n   In fact, the only time when allowing the market\
    \ to decide can be\n   easily supported is when the competing technologies do\
    \ not overlap.\n   In those cases -- for example, different applications in the\
    \ user\n   space -- the core network is not perturbed by the decision-making\n\
    \   process, and transition from one technology to the other is\n   relatively\
    \ painless.  This is not the case for MPLS-TP OAM;\n   coexistence while the market\
    \ determines the correct approach would be\n   expensive, while the necessary\
    \ transition after the decision has been\n   made would be difficult and costly.\n"
- title: 6.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "6.  Security Considerations\n   This informational document does not introduce\
    \ any security issues.\n   However, it should be noted that the existence of two\
    \ OAM protocols\n   raises a number of security concerns:\n   o  Each OAM protocol\
    \ must be secured.  This leads to the existence of\n      two security solutions\
    \ that each need configuration and\n      management.  The increased complexity\
    \ of operating security\n      mechanisms tends to reduce the likelihood of them\
    \ being used in\n      the field and so increases the vulnerability of the network.\n\
    \      Similarly, the existence of two security mechanisms raises the\n      risk\
    \ of misconfiguration.\n   o  One OAM protocol may be used as a vector to attack\
    \ the other.\n      Inserting an OAM message of the other OAM protocol onto a\
    \ link may\n      cause the service to be disrupted and, because some nodes may\n\
    \      support both OAM protocols, it may be possible to cause the\n      disruption\
    \ at a remote point in the network.\n   o  Securing a network protocol is not\
    \ a trivial matter for protocol\n      designers.  Duplicating design effort is\
    \ unlikely to result in a\n      stronger solution and runs the risk of diluting\
    \ the effort and\n      creating two less-secure solutions.\n"

    \ protocols\n   that derive from the same root technology and that, for political\
    \ and\n   personality reasons, were never reconciled prior to wide-scale\n   deployment.\
    \  It is an accident of history that one of these protocols\n   did not gain overwhelming\
    \ deployment and so force the other into\n   retirement.\n   The existence of\
    \ these two widely deployed and highly functional\n   competing IGPs doubles the\
    \ cost of link-state IGP maintenance and\n   deployment in the Internet.  This\
    \ is a situation that will almost\n   certainly continue for the lifetime of the\
    \ Internet.  Although the\n   Internet is clearly successful and operates well,\
    \ the existence of\n   these two IGPs forces router vendors to implement both\
    \ protocols\n   (doubling the protocol cost of all routers even when an operator\
    \ only\n   wants to deploy one of the protocols), forcing the operator to make\n\
    \   an active choice between IGPs during deployment and requiring a\n   gateway\
    \ function between the islands of protocol use.\n   A mitigating factor in this\
    \ specific case is that, owing to the way\n   networks are partitioned for administrative\
    \ and scaling reasons,\n   there already existed a gateway routing protocol called\
    \ BGP that\n   propagates a summarized form of the IGP reachability information\n\

    \ a translation function between OSPF and IS-IS, and the\n   two IGPs can continue\
    \ to exist without impacting the function of the\n   Internet.  Thus, unlike the\
    \ situation with MPLS OAM, the choice of\n   IGP protocol is truly a local decision;\

    \ of the creators of the Internet and from\n   the consequent depletion of the\
    \ IPv4 address space.\n   This transition has proved to be the hardest problem\
    \ that the IETF\n   has ever addressed.  The invention and standardization of\
    \ IPv6 were\n   straightforward by comparison, but it has been exceptionally\n\
    \   difficult to migrate networks from one established protocol to a new\n   protocol.\n\
    \   The early assumption that by the time the IPv4 address space was\n   exhausted\
    \ IPv6 would be universally deployed failed to materialize\n   due to (understandable)\
    \ short-term economic constraints.  Early\n   migration would have been simpler\
    \ and less costly than the current\n   plans.  The Internet is now faced with\
    \ the considerable complexity of\n   implementing and deploying interworking functions.\n\
    \   If anything can be learned from the IPv4/IPv6 experience, it is that\n   every\
    \ effort should be applied to avoid the need to migrate or\n   jointly operate\
    \ two protocols within one network.  Adding to the mix,\n   a number of issues\
    \ caused by OAM interworking of MPLS, one of the\n   Internet's core protocols,\
    \ would be most unwelcome and would\n   complicate matters still further.\n"

- title: B.1.  SONET and SDH
  contents:
  - "B.1.  SONET and SDH\n   SONET and SDH were defined as competing standards that\
    \ basically\n   provided the same functionality (simultaneous transport of multiple\n\
    \   circuits of differing origin within a single framing protocol).\n   SONET\
    \ was developed first by ANSI, based on the 24-channel PDH\n   hierarchy existing\
    \ in North America and Japan.  The basic rate is\n   based on DS3.  Some time\
    \ later, ETSI developed SDH based on the\n   30-channel PDH deployed in Europe.\
    \  The basic rate is based on E4\n   (3x DS3).  The key difference between PDH\
    \ and SDH is that the \"S\"\n   stands for \"synchronous\" and the \"P\" for \"\
    plesiochronous\".  Thus, the\n   difference between the technologies is timing\
    \ related.\n   SONET was adopted in the U.S., Canada, and Japan, and SDH in the\
    \ rest\n   of the world.\n   Until 1988, the standards were unpublished and under\
    \ development.\n   o  The SONET standard ANSI T1.105-1988 was published in 1988.\n\
    \   o  The SDH standard ETSI EN 300 417 was first published in 1992.\n   o  The\
    \ compromise SDH/SONET standard ITU-T G.707 was published in\n      1988 (see\
    \ below for the nature of this compromise).\n   Some implementers were confused\
    \ by this situation.  Equipment\n   manufacturers initially needed to select the\
    \ market segment they\n   intended to address.  The cost of chipsets for a limited\
    \ market\n   increased, and only a limited number of equipment manufacturers were\n\
    \   available for selection in each market.\n   Obviously, most equipment vendors\
    \ wanted to sell their equipment in\n   both regions.  Hence, today most chips\
    \ support both SONET and SDH,\n   and the selection is a matter of provisioning.\
    \  The impact of the\n   additional function to support both markets has had a\
    \ mixed impact on\n   cost.  It has enabled a higher volume of production, which\
    \ reduced\n   cost, but it has required increased development and complexity,\
    \ which\n   increased cost.\n   Because the regions of applicability of SONET\
    \ and SDH are well known,\n   service providers do not need to consider the merits\
    \ of the two\n   standards and their long-term role in the industry when examining\n\
    \   their investment options.\n   To be able to deploy SONET and SDH worldwide,\
    \ the regional SDO\n   experts came together in the ITU-T to define a frame structure\
    \ and a\n   frame rate that would allow interconnection of SONET and SDH.  A\n\
    \   compromise was agreed upon and approved in an ITU-T meeting in Seoul\n   in\
    \ 1988.\n   The SDH standard supports both the North American and Japanese\n \
    \  24-channel/T1/T3 hierarchy and the European 30-channel/E1/E4-based\n   hierarchy\
    \ within a single multiplexing structure.  SDH has options\n   for payloads at\
    \ VC-4 (150 Mb/s) and above.  SDH allows T1/T3 services\n   to be delivered in\
    \ Europe and E1 services to be delivered in North\n   America using a common infrastructure.\n\
    \   Deployment of an E1-only standard in North America would have\n   required\
    \ the conversion of all of the 24-channel/T1 deployed\n   equipment and services\
    \ into the 30-channel/E1 format.  Similarly,\n   deployment of a T1-only standard\
    \ in Europe would have required the\n   conversion of all of the 30-channel/E1\
    \ equipment and services into\n   the 24-channel/T1 format.  Clearly, given the\
    \ existing network\n   deployments (in 1988), this was not a practical proposition\
    \ and was\n   the principal reason why a compromise was reached.\n   The result\
    \ of the compromise is documented in ITU-T Recommendation\n   G.707 [G.707], which\
    \ includes the frame definition and frame rates\n   and also documents how SONET\
    \ and SDH can interconnect.\n   An extensive interworking function had to be implemented\
    \ in order to\n   provide global connectivity (e.g., throughout the U.S. and Europe),\n\
    \   and this resulted in an increase in operational overhead.  The\n   interworking\
    \ function has to be performed before the SDH-based\n   segment is reached.  The\
    \ reason for placing the interworking function\n   on the SONET side was that\
    \ in a previous agreement on interconnection\n   the functionality was placed\
    \ on the European side.\n"
