  - "1.  Introduction\n   This document specifies mechanisms for IS-IS [RFC1195] [ISO_IEC10589]\n\
    \   [RFC5308] to be autoconfiguring.  Such mechanisms could reduce the\n   management\
    \ burden for configuring a network, especially where plug-\n   and-play device\
    \ configuration is required.\n   IS-IS autoconfiguration is comprised of the following\
    \ functions:\n   1.  IS-IS default configuration\n   2.  IS-IS System ID self-generation\n\
    \   3.  System ID duplication detection and resolution\n   4.  IS-IS TLV utilization\
    \ (authentication TLV, metrics in\n       reachability advertisements, and Dynamic\
    \ Name TLV)\n   This document also defines mechanisms to prevent the unintentional\n\

    \ is identified by\n   a Network Entity Title (NET), which is a type of Network\
    \ Service\n   Access Point (NSAP).  The NET is the address of an instance of the\n\
    \   IS-IS protocol running on an IS.\n   The autoconfiguration mechanism generates\
    \ the IS-IS NET as the\n   following:\n   o  Area address\n         In IS-IS autoconfiguration,\
    \ this field MUST be 13 octets long\n         and set to all 0s.\n   o  System\
    \ ID\n         This field follows the area address field and is 6 octets in\n\
    \         length.  There are two basic requirements for the System ID\n      \
    \   generation:\n         -  As specified by the IS-IS protocol, this field must\
    \ be\n            unique among all routers in the same area.\n         -  After\
    \ its initial generation, the System ID SHOULD remain\n            stable.  Changes\
    \ such as interface enable/disable, interface\n            connect/disconnect,\
    \ device reboot, firmware update, or\n            configuration changes SHOULD\
    \ NOT cause the System ID to\n            change.  System ID change as part of\
    \ the System ID collision\n            resolution process MUST be supported. \
    \ Implementations\n            SHOULD allow the System ID to be cleared by a user-initiated\n\
    \            system reset.\n         More specific considerations for System ID\

- title: 3.4.1.  Startup Mode
  contents:
  - "3.4.1.  Startup Mode\n   When a router starts operation in autoconfiguration\
    \ mode, both the S\n   and A flags MUST be set in the Router-Fingerprint TLV included\
    \ in\n   both hellos and LSP #0.  During this mode, only LSP #0 is generated\n\
    \   and IS or IP/IPv6 reachability TLVs MUST NOT be included in LSP #0.\n   A\
    \ router remains in startup mode for a minimum period of time\n   (recommended\
    \ to be 1 minute).  This time should be sufficient to\n   bring up adjacencies\
    \ to all expected neighbors.  A router leaves\n   startup mode once the minimum\
    \ time has elapsed and full LSP database\n   synchronization is achieved with\
    \ all neighbors in the UP state.\n   When a router exits startup mode, it clears\
    \ the S flag in Router-\n   Fingerprint TLVs that it sends in hellos and LSP #0.\
    \  The router MAY\n   now advertise the IS neighbor and IP/IPv6 prefix reachability\
    \ in its\n   LSPs and MAY generate LSPs with a non-zero number.\n   The purpose\
    \ of startup mode is to minimize the occurrence of System\n   ID changes for a\
    \ router once it has become fully operational.  Any\n   System ID change during\
    \ startup mode will have minimal impact on a\n   running network because, while\
    \ in startup mode, the router is not yet\n   being used for forwarding traffic.\n"

  contents:
  - "3.4.3.  IS-IS System ID Duplication Detection\n   The System ID of each node\

    \ based on entropies (e.g.,\n   Media Access Control (MAC) address) that are generally\
    \ expected to be\n   unique.  However, since there may be limitations to the available\n\
    \   entropies, there is still the possibility of System ID duplication.\n   This\
    \ section defines how IS-IS detects and resolves System ID\n   duplication.  A\
    \ duplicate system ID may occur between neighbors or\n   between routers in the\
    \ same area that are not neighbors.\n   A duplicate system ID with a neighbor\
    \ is detected when the System ID\n   received in an IIH is identical to the local\
    \ System ID and the\n   Router-Fingerprint in the received Router-Fingerprint\
    \ TLV does NOT\n   match the locally generated Router-Fingerprint.\n   A duplicate\
    \ system ID with a non-neighbor is detected when an LSP #0\n   is received, the\

  contents:

    \ ID and perform a protocol restart.\n   The resolution procedure attempts to\
    \ minimize disruption to a running\n   network by choosing, whenever possible,\
    \ to restart a router that is\n   in startup mode.\n   The contents of the Router-Fingerprint\
    \ TLVs for the two routers with\n   duplicate system IDs are compared.\n   If\

- title: 3.4.5.  System ID and Router-Fingerprint Generation Considerations
  contents:
  - "3.4.5.  System ID and Router-Fingerprint Generation Considerations\n   As specified\
    \ in this document, there are two distinguishing items\n   that need to be self-generated:\
    \ the System ID and Router-Fingerprint.\n   In a network device, normally there\
    \ are some resources that can\n   provide an extremely high probability of uniqueness\
    \ (some examples\n   listed below).  These resources can be used as seeds to derive\n\
    \   identifiers:\n   o  MAC address(es)\n   o  Configured IP address(es)\n   o\
    \  Hardware IDs (e.g., CPU ID)\n   o  Device serial number(s)\n   o  System clock\
    \ at a certain, specific time\n   o  Arbitrary received packet(s) on an interface(s)\n\
    \   This document recommends the use of an IEEE 802 48-bit MAC address\n   associated\
    \ with the router as the initial System ID.  This document\n   does not specify\
    \ a specific method to regenerate the System ID when\n   duplication happens.\n\
    \   This document also does not specify a method to generate the Router-\n   Fingerprint.\n\
    \   There is an important concern that the seeds listed above (except MAC\n  \
    \ address) might not be available in some small devices such as home\n   routers.\
    \  This is because of hardware/software limitations and the\n   lack of sufficient\
    \ communication packets at the initial stage in home\n   routers when doing IS-IS\
    \ autoconfiguration.  In this case, this\n   document suggests using the MAC address\
    \ as the System ID and\n   generating a pseudorandom number based on another seed\
    \ (such as the\n   memory address of a certain variable in the program) as the\
    \ Router-\n   Fingerprint.  The pseudorandom number might not have a very high\n\
    \   probability of uniqueness in this solution but should be sufficient\n   in\
    \ home network scenarios.\n   The considerations surrounding System ID stability\
    \ described in\n   Section 3.2 also need to be applied.\n"
- title: 3.4.6.  Duplication of Both System ID and Router-Fingerprint
  contents:
  - "3.4.6.  Duplication of Both System ID and Router-Fingerprint\n   As described\
    \ above, the resources for generating a System ID /\n   Router-Fingerprint might\
    \ be very constrained during the initial\n   stages.  Hence, the duplication of\
    \ both System ID and Router-\n   Fingerprint need to be considered.  In such a\
    \ case, it is possible\n   that a router will receive an LSP with a System ID\
    \ and Router-\n   Fingerprint identical to the local values, but the LSP is NOT\n\
    \   identical to the locally generated copy, i.e., the sequence number is\n  \
    \ newer or the sequence number is the same, but the LSP has a valid\n   checksum\
    \ that does not match.  The term DD-LSP (Duplication Detection\n   LSP) is used\
    \ to describe such an LSP.\n   In a benign case, this will occur if a router restarts\
    \ and it\n   receives copies of its own LSPs from its previous incarnation.  This\n\
    \   benign case needs to be distinguished from the pathological case\n   where\
    \ there are two different routers with the same System ID and the\n   same Router-Fingerprint.\n\
    \   In the benign case, the restarting router will generate a new version\n  \
    \ of its own LSP with a higher sequence number and flood the new LSP\n   version.\
    \  This will cause other routers in the network to update\n   their LSP Database\
    \ (LSPDB) and synchronization will be achieved.\n   In the pathological case,\
    \ the generation of a new version of an LSP\n   by one of the \"twins\" will cause\
    \ the other twin to generate the same\n   LSP with a higher sequence number --\
    \ and oscillation will continue\n   without achieving LSPDB synchronization.\n\
    \   Note that a comparison of the S flag in the Router-Fingerprint TLV\n   cannot\
    \ be performed, as in the benign case it is expected that the S\n   flag will\
    \ be clear.  Also note that the conditions for detecting a\n   duplicate system\
    \ ID will NOT be satisfied because both the System ID\n   and the Router-Fingerprint\
    \ will be identical.\n   The following procedure is defined:\n       DD-state\
    \ is a boolean that indicates if a\n         DD-LSP #0 has been received.\n  \
    \     DD-count is the count of the number of occurrences\n         of reception\
    \ of a DD-LSP.\n       DD-timer is a timer associated with reception of\n    \
    \    DD-LSPs; the recommended value is 60 seconds.\n       DD-max is the maximum\
    \ number of DD-LSPs allowed\n        to be received in DD-timer interval;\n  \
    \      the recommended value is 3.\n   When a DD-LSP is received:\n     If DD-state\
    \ is FALSE:\n       DD-state is set to TRUE.\n       DD-timer is started.\n  \
    \     DD-count is initialized to 1.\n     If DD-state is TRUE:\n       DD-count\
    \ is incremented.\n       If DD-count is >= DD-max:\n          The local system\
    \ MUST generate a new System ID\n           and Router-Fingerprint and restart\
    \ the protocol.\n          DD-state is (re)initialized to FALSE and\n        \
    \   DD-timer is canceled.\n     If DD-timer expires:\n       DD-state is set to\
    \ FALSE.\n   Note that to minimize the likelihood of duplication of both System\
    \ ID\n   and Router-Fingerprint reoccurring, routers SHOULD have more\n   entropies\
    \ available.  One simple way to achieve this is to add the\n   LSP sequence number\
    \ of the next LSP it will send to the Router-\n   Fingerprint.\n"

  contents:
  - "3.5.3.  Dynamic Name TLV\n   IS-IS autoconfiguration routers MAY advertise their\
    \ Dynamic Name TLV\n   (TLV 137 [RFC5301]).  The hostname could be provisioned\
    \ by an IT\n   system or just use the name of vendor, device type, or serial number,\n\
    \   etc.\n   To guarantee the uniqueness of the hostname, the System ID SHOULD\
    \ be\n   appended as a suffix in the names.\n"

  contents:
  - "4.  Security Considerations\n   In the absence of cryptographic authentication,\
    \ it is possible for an\n   attacker to inject a PDU falsely indicating there\
    \ is a duplicate\n   system ID.  This may trigger automatic restart of the protocol\
    \ using\n   the duplicate-id resolution procedures defined in this document.\n\
    \   Note that the use of authentication is incompatible with\n   autoconfiguration\
    \ as it requires some manual configuration.\n   For wired deployment, the wired\
    \ connection itself could be considered\n   as an implicit authentication in that\
    \ unwanted routers are usually\n   not able to connect (i.e., there is some kind\
    \ of physical security in\n   place preventing the connection of rogue devices);\
    \ for wireless\n   deployment, the authentication could be achieved at the lower\n\
    \   wireless link layer.\n"
