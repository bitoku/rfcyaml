  - "Abstract\n   In IPv6-only provider networks, transporting IPv4 packets\n   encapsulated
    in IPv6 is a common solution to the problem of IPv4\n   service continuity.  A

    having their own specific\n   characteristics.  As these approaches share a similar

  - "1.  Introduction\n   IPv4 service continuity is one of the major technical challenges
    that\n   must be considered during IPv6 migration.  Over the past few years, a\n
    \  number of different approaches have been developed to assist with\n   this
    problem (e.g., as described in [RFC6333], [RFC7596], and\n   [RFC7597]).  These
    approaches, referred to as \"S46 mechanisms\" in\n   this document, exist in order
    to meet the particular deployment,\n   scaling, addressing, and other requirements
    of different service\n   providers' networks.\n   A common feature shared among
    all of the differing modes is the\n   integration of softwire tunnel endpoint
    functionality into the\n   Customer Premises Equipment (CPE) router.  Due to this
    inherent data\n   plane similarity, a single CPE may be capable of supporting
    several\n   different approaches.  Users may also wish to configure a specific\n
    \  mode of operation.\n   A service provider's network may also have more than
    one S46\n   mechanism enabled in order to support a diverse CPE population with\n
    \  differing client functionality, such as during a migration between\n   mechanisms
    or where services require specific supporting softwire\n   architectures.\n   For
    softwire-based services to be successfully established, it is\n   essential that
    the customer's end node and the service provider's end\n   node and provisioning
    systems are able to indicate their capabilities\n   and preferred mode of operation.\n
    \  A number of DHCPv6 options for the provisioning of softwires have\n   been
    standardized:\n   RFC 6334  Defines DHCPv6 option 64 for configuring Basic Bridging\n
    \            BroadBand (B4) [RFC6333] elements with the IPv6 address of\n             the
    Address Family Transition Router (AFTR) [RFC6333].\n   RFC 7341  Defines DHCPv6
    option 88 for configuring the address of a\n             DHCPv4-over-DHCPv6 server,
    which can then be used by a\n             softwire client for obtaining further
    configuration.\n   RFC 7598  Defines DHCPv6 options 94, 95, and 96 for provisioning\n
    \            Mapping of Address and Port with Encapsulation (MAP-E)\n             [RFC7597],
    Mapping of Address and Port using Translation\n             (MAP-T) [RFC7599],
    and Lightweight 4over6 [RFC7596]\n             respectively.\n   This document
    describes a DHCPv6-based prioritization method, whereby\n   a CPE that supports
    several S46 mechanisms and receives configuration\n   for more than one can prioritize
    which mechanism to use.  The method\n   requires no server-side logic to be implemented
    and only uses a\n   simple S46 mechanism prioritization to be implemented in the
    CPE.\n   The prioritization method as described here does not provide\n   redundancy
    between S46 mechanisms for the client.  That is, if the\n   highest priority S46
    mechanism that has been provisioned to the\n   client is not available for any
    reason, the means for identifying\n   this and falling back to the S46 mechanism
    with the next highest\n   priority is not in the scope of this document.\n"

      and avoid (as far\n        as possible) overloading the document with solution-specific\n
      \       terms.\n   (6)  Flexibility: Allow operators to compile CPE software
      only for\n        the mode(s) necessary for their chosen deployment context(s).\n
      \  (7)  Simplicity: Provide a model that allows operators to only\n        implement

      of unneeded modes.\n"

      receipt of a DHCPv6 Advertise message from the server containing\n   OPTION_S46_PRIORITY,
      the client performs the following steps:\n   1.  Check the contents of the DHCPv6
      message for options containing\n       valid S46 mechanism configuration.  A
      candidate list of possible\n       S46 mechanisms is created from these option
      codes.\n   2.  Check the contents of OPTION_S46_PRIORITY for the DHCPv6 option\n
      \      codes contained in the included s46-option-code fields.  From\n       this,
      an S46 mechanism priority list is created, ordered from\n       highest to lowest
      following the appearance order.\n   3.  Sequentially check the priority list
      against the candidate list\n       until a match is found.\n   4.  When a match
      is found, the client MUST configure the resulting\n       S46 mechanism.\n   In
      the event that no match is found between the priority list and the\n   candidate
      list, the client MAY proceed with configuring one or more\n   of the provisioned
      S46 softwire mechanism(s).  In this case, which\n   mechanism(s) are chosen
      by the client is implementation specific and\n   not defined here.\n   If an

      configuring the provisioned S46 mechanisms as if\n   OPTION_S46_PRIORITY had
      not been received.\n   If an unknown option code is received in the OPTION_S46_PRIORITY\n
      \  option, the client MUST skip it and continue processing other listed\n   option
      codes if they exist.  The initial option codes that are\n   allowed to be included

    \  The following subsections describe some considerations for operators\n   who
    are planning on implementing multiple softwire mechanisms in\n   their network
    (e.g., during a migration between mechanisms).\n"
  - contents:
    - "2.1.  Client Address Planning\n   As an operator's available IPv4 resources
      are likely to be limited,\n   it may be desirable to use a common range of IPv4
      addresses across\n   all of the active softwire mechanisms.  However, this is
      likely to\n   result in difficulties in routing ingress IPv4 traffic to the
      correct\n   Border Relay (BR) / AFTR instance, which is actively serving a given\n
      \  CE.  For example, a client that is configured to use MAP-E may send\n   its
      traffic to the MAP-E BR; however, on the return path, the ingress\n   IP traffic
      gets routed to a MAP-T BR.  The resulting translated\n   packet that gets forwarded
      to the MAP-E client will be dropped.\n   Therefore, operators are advised to
      use separate IPv4 pools for each\n   of the different mechanisms to simplify
      planning and IPv4 routing.\n   For IPv6 planning, there is less of a constraint
      as the BR/AFTR\n   elements for the different mechanisms can contain configuration
      for\n   overlapping the client's IPv6 addresses, provided that one mechanism\n
      \  is actively serving a given client at a time.  However, the IPv6\n   address
      that is used as the tunnel concentrator's endpoint (BR/AFTR\n   address) needs
      to be different for each mechanism to ensure correct\n   operation.\n"

    - "2.2.  Backwards Compatability with Existing Softwire Clients\n   Deployed clients
      that can support multiple softwire mechanisms, but\n   do not implement the
      prioritization mechanism described here may\n   require additional planning.
      \ In this scenario, the CPE would request\n   configuration for all of the supported
      softwire mechanisms in its\n   DHCPv6 Option Request Option (ORO), but would
      not request\n   OPTION_S46_PRIORITY.  By default, the DHCPv6 server will respond
      with\n   configuration for all of the requested mechanisms, which could result\n
      \  in unpredictable and unwanted client configuration.\n   In this scenario,
      it may be necessary for the operator to implement\n   logic within the DHCPv6
      server to identify such clients and only\n   provision them with configuration
      for a single softwire mechanism.\n   It should be noted that this can lead to
      complexity and reduced\n   scalability in the DHCPv6 server implementation due
      to the additional\n   DHCPv6 message processing overhead.\n"
