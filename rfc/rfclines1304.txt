Abstract This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB) for use with network management protocols in TCP/IP based internets.
In particular, it defines objects for managing SIP (SMDS Interface Protocol) objects.
The Internet standard Network Management Framework consists of three components.
They are: RFC 1155 [3] which defines the SMI, the mechanisms used for describing and naming objects for the purpose of management.
[9] defines a more concise description mechanism, which is wholly consistent with the SMI.
RFC 1156 [4] which defines MIB I, the core set of managed objects for the Internet suite of protocols.
RFC 1213 [6], defines MIB  II, an evolution of MIB I based on implementation experience and new operational requirements.
RFC 1157 [5] which defines the SNMP, the protocol used for network access to managed objects.
The Framework permits new objects to be defined for the purpose of experimentation and evaluation.
Objects Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed the Management Information Base or MIB.
Objects in the MIB are defined using the subset of Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1)
[7] defined in the SMI.
In particular, each object has a name, a syntax, and an encoding.
The name is an object identifier, an administratively assigned name, which specifies an object type.
The object type together with an object instance serves to uniquely identify a specific instantiation of the object.
For human convenience, we often use a textual string, termed the OBJECT DESCRIPTOR, to also refer to the object type.
The syntax of an object type defines the abstract data structure corresponding to that object type.
The ASN.1 language is used for this purpose.
However, the SMI RFC 1155 [3] purposely restricts the ASN.1 constructs which may be used.
These restrictions are explicitly made for simplicity.
The encoding of an object type is simply how that object type is represented using the object type's syntax.
Implicitly tied to the notion of an object type's syntax and encoding
is how the object type is represented when being transmitted on the network.
The SMI specifies the use of the basic encoding rules of ASN.1 International Standard 8825 [8], subject to the additional requirements imposed by the SNMP.
Format of Definitions Section 4 contains contains the specification of all object types contained in this MIB module.
The object types are defined using the conventions defined in the SMI, as amended by the extensions specified in RFC 1212 [9].
These objects are used when the particular media being used to realize an interface is a SIP interface.
At present, this applies to these values of the ifType variable in the Internet standard MIB:
For these interfaces, the value of the ifSpecific variable in the MIB II [6] has the OBJECT IDENTIFIER value:
The definitions contained herein are based on the SIP specifications in Bellcore TR TSV 000772 and TR TSV 000773
The SIP (SMDS Interface Protocol) protocol stack is defined as follows in TR TSV 000772
The PLCP (Physical Layer Convergence Procedure) adapts the capabilities of the transmission system (DS1 or DS3 formats) to the service expected by SIP Level 2.
Managed objects for DS1 and DS3 Interface Types are defined in RFC 1232 [13] and RFC 1233 [14] respectively (and amended in RFC 1239 [17]), and can be utilized for management of SIP interfaces.
This document defines managed objects for the remaining protocol levels of the SIP Interface Type.
This document does not specify objects for the management of subscription or configuration of Subscriber Network Interfaces (SNIs).
Those objects are defined in Definitions of Managed Objects for SMDS Subscription [18].
Bellcore requirements on these objects are specified in TA TSV 001062

The value is a sum.
This sum initially takes the value zero.
For each version, V, that this interface supports, 2 raised to (V 1) is added to the sum.
For example, a port supporting versions 1 and 2 would have a value of (2^(1 1) 2^(2 1)) 3.
The sipL3VersionSupport is effectively a bit mask with Version 1 equal to the least significant bit (LSB)."

Implementation of this group is mandatory for systems   that implement IP over SMDS Interface Protocol.
Although the objects in this group are read only, at the   agent's discretion they may be made read write so that the   management station, when appropriately authorized, may   change the addressing information related to the   configuration of a logical IP subnetwork implemented on   top of SMDS.
This table is necessary to support RFC1209 (IP over SMDS)   and gives information on the Group Addresses and ARP
Addresses used in the Logical IP subnetwork.
One SMDS address may be associated with multiple IP   addresses.
One SNI may be associated with multiple LISs.

The SIP Error Log   Implementation of this group is mandatory   for all systems that implement SIP Level 3.
"A table that contains the latest occurrence of the following syntactical SIP L3PDU errors: Destination Address Field Format Error,
The following pertains to the 60 least significant bits of the 64 bit address field.
The 60 bits contained in the address subfield can be used to represent addresses up to 15 decimal digits.
Each decimal digit shall be encoded into four bits using Binary Coded Decimal (BCD), with the most significant digit occurring left most.
If not all 15 digits are required, then the remainder of this field shall be padded on the right with bits set to one.
An error is considered to have occurred:
if the first four bits of the address subfield are not BCD, OR b).
if the first four bits of the address subfield are populated with the country code value 0001, AND the 40 bits which follow are not Binary Coded Decimal (BCD) encoded values of the 10 digit addresses, OR the remaining 16 least significant bits are not populated with 1's, OR c).
if the address subfield is not correct according to another numbering plan which is dependent upon the carrier assigning the numbers and offering SMDS.
Source Address Field Format Error, The description of this parameter is the same as the description of the Destination Address Field Format Error.
Invalid BAsize Field Value, An error is considered to have occurred when the BAsize field of an SIP L3PDU contains a value less that 32, greater than 9220 octets without the CRC32 field present, greater than 9224 octets with the CRC32 field present, or not equal to a multiple of 4 octets, Invalid Header Extension Length Field Value, An error is considered to have occurred when the Header Extension Length field value is not equal 3.
Invalid Header Extension Element Length, An error is considered to have occurred when the Header Extension Element Length is greater than 12.
Invalid Header Extension Version Element Position, Length, or Value, An error is considered to have occurred when a Version element with Length 3, Type 0, and Value 1 does not appear first within the Header Extension, or an element Type 0 appears somewhere other than within the first three octets in the Header Extension.
Invalid Header Extension Carrier Selection Element Position, Length, Value or Format, An error is considered to have occurred when a Carrier Selection element does not appear second within the Header Extension, if the Element Type does not equal 1, the Element Length does not equal 4, 6, or 8, the Element Value field is not
four BCD encoded decimal digits used in specifying the Carrier Identification Code (CIC), or the identified CIC code is invalid.
An error is considered to have occurred when the Header Extension PAD is 9 octets in length, or if the Header Extension PAD is greater than zero octets in length and the Header Extension PAD does not follow all Header Extension elements or does not begin with at least one octet of all zeros.
BEtag Mismatch Error, An error is considered to have occurred when the Beginning End Tags in the SIP L3PDU header and trailer are not equal.
BAsize Field not equal to Length Field Error, An error is considered to have occurred when the value of the BAsize Field does not equal the value of the Length Field.
Incorrect Length Error, and An error is considered to have occurred when the the Length field value is not equal to the portion of the SIP L3PDU which extends from the Destination Address field up to and including the CRC32 field (if present) or up to and including the PAD field (if the CRC32 field is not present).
As an optional check, an error is considered to have occurred when the length of a partially received SIP L3PDU exceeds the BAsize value.
An error is considered to have occurred when the elapsed time between receipt of BOM and corresponding EOM exceeds the value of the MRI (Message Receive Interval) for a particular transport signal format.
An entry is indexed by interface number and error type, and contains Source Address, Destination Address and a timestamp.
All these errors are counted in the sipL3Errors counter.
When sipL3PDUErrorTimeStamp is equal to zero, the SipL3PDUErrorEntry does not contain any valid information."
