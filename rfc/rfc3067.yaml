  - "Abstract\n   The purpose of the Incident Object Description and Exchange Format\
    \ is\n   to define a common data format for the description, archiving and\n \
    \  exchange of information about incidents between CSIRTs (Computer\n   Security\
    \ Incident Response Teams) (including alert, incident in\n   investigation, archiving,\
    \ statistics, reporting, etc.).  This\n   document describes the high-level requirements\
    \ for such a description\n   and exchange format, including the reasons for those\
    \ requirements.\n   Examples are used to illustrate the requirements where necessary.\n"

- title: 2. Introduction
  contents:
  - "2. Introduction\n   This document defines requirements for the Incident object\n\
    \   Description and Exchange Format (IODEF), which is the intended\n   product\
    \ of the Incident Taxonomy Working Group (ITDWG) at TERENA [2].\n   IODEF is planned\
    \ to be a standard format which allows CSIRTs to\n   exchange operational and\
    \ statistical information; it may also provide\n   a basis for the development\
    \ of compatible and inter-operable tools\n   for Incident recording, tracking\
    \ and exchange.\n   Another aim is to extend the work of IETF IDWG (currently\
    \ focused on\n   Intrusion Detection exchange format and communication protocol)\
    \ to\n   the description of incidents as higher level elements in Network\n  \
    \ Security.  This will involve CSIRTs and their constituency related\n   issues.\n\
    \   The IODEF set of documents of which this document is the first will\n   contain\
    \ IODEF Data Model and XML DTD specification.  Further\n   discussion of this\
    \ document will take place in the ITDWG mailing\n   lists <incident-taxonomy@terena.nl>\
    \ or <iodef@terena.nl>, archives\n   are available correspondently at\n   http://hypermail.terena.nl/incident-taxonomy-list/mail-archive/\
    \ and\n   http://hypermail.terena.nl/iodef-list/mail-archive/\n"
- title: 2.1. Rationale
  contents:
  - "2.1. Rationale\n   This work is based on attempts to establish cooperation and\n\
    \   information exchange between leading/advanced CSIRTs in Europe and\n   among\
    \ the FIRST community.  These CSIRTs understand the advantages of\n   information\
    \ exchange and cooperation in processing, tracking and\n   investigating security\
    \ incidents.\n   Computer Incidents are becoming distributed and International\
    \ and\n   involve many CSIRTs across borders, languages and cultures.  Post-\n\
    \   Incident information and statistics exchange is important for future\n   Incident\
    \ prevention and Internet security improvement.  The key\n   element for information\
    \ exchange in all these cases is a common\n   format for Incident (Object) description.\n\
    \   It is probable that in further development or implementation the\n   IODEF\
    \ might be used for forensic purposes, and this means that\n   Incident description\
    \ must be unambiguous and allow for future custody\n   (archiving/documentation)\
    \ features.\n   Another issue that is targeted by developing IODEF is a need to\
    \ have\n   higher level Incident description and exchange format than will be\n\
    \   provided by IDS (Intrusion Detection Systems) and the proposed IDEF\n   (Intrusion\
    \ Detection Exchange Format).  Compatibility with IDEF and\n   other related standards\
    \ will be satisfied by the IODEF requirement on\n   modularity and extensibility.\
    \  IODEF should vertically be compatible\n   with IDMEF, IODEF might be able to\
    \ include or reference IDMEF Alert\n   message as initial information about Incident.\n"

  contents:
  - "2.2. Incident Description Terms\n   A definition of the main terms used in the\
    \ rest of document is given\n   for clarity.\n   Where possible, existing definitions\
    \ will be used; some definitions\n   will need additional detail and further consideration.\n\
    \   Taxonomy of the Computer Security Incident related terminology made\n   by\
    \ TERENA's ITDWG [2] is presented in [12].\n"
- title: 2.2.1. Attack
  contents:
  - "2.2.1. Attack\n   An assault on system security that derives from an intelligent\n\
    \   threat, i.e., an intelligent act that is a deliberate attempt\n   (especially\
    \ in the sense of a method or technique) to evade security\n   services and violate\
    \ the security policy of a system.\n   Attack can be active or passive, by insider\
    \ or by outsider, or via\n   attack mediator.\n"
- title: 2.2.2. Attacker
  contents:
  - "2.2.2. Attacker\n   Attacker is individual who attempts one or more attacks in\
    \ order to\n   achieve an objective(s).\n   For the purpose of IODEF attacker\
    \ is described by its network ID,\n   organisation which network/computer attack\
    \ was originated and\n   physical location information (optional).\n"
- title: 2.2.3. CSIRT
  contents:
  - "2.2.3. CSIRT\n   CSIRT (Computer Security Incident Response Team) is used in\
    \ IODEF to\n   refer to the authority handling the Incident and creating Incident\n\
    \   Object Description.  The CSIRT is also likely to be involved in\n   evidence\
    \ collection and custody, incident remedy, etc.\n   In IODEF CSIRT represented\
    \ by its ID, constituency, public key, etc.\n"
- title: 2.2.4. Damage
  contents:
  - "2.2.4. Damage\n   An intended or unintended consequence of an attack which affects\
    \ the\n   normal operation of the targeted system or service.  Description of\n\
    \   damage may include free text description of actual result of attack,\n   and,\
    \ where possible, structured information about the particular\n   damaged system,\
    \ subsystem or service.\n"
- title: 2.2.5. Event
  contents:
  - "2.2.5. Event\n   An action directed at a target which is intended to result in\
    \ a\n   change of state (status) of the target.  From the point of view of\n \
    \  event origination, it can be defined as any observable occurrence in\n   a\
    \ system or network which resulted in an alert being generated.  For\n   example,\
    \ three failed logins in 10 seconds might indicate a brute-\n   force login attack.\n"
- title: 2.2.6. Evidence
  contents:
  - "2.2.6. Evidence\n   Evidence is information relating to an event that proves\
    \ or supports\n   a conclusion about the event. With respect to security incidents\
    \ (the\n   events), it may include but is not limited to: data dump created by\n\
    \   Intrusion Detection System (IDS), data from syslog file, kernel\n   statistics,\
    \ cache, memory, temporary file system, or other data that\n   caused the alert\
    \ or were collected after the incident happened.\n   Special rules and care must\
    \ be taken when storing and archiving\n   evidence, particularly to preserve its\
    \ integrity.  When necessary\n   evidence should be stored encrypted.\n   According\
    \ to the Guidelines for Evidence Collection and Archiving\n   (Evidence) evidence\
    \ must be strictly secured.  The chain of evidence\n   custody needs to be clearly\
    \ documented.\n   It is essential that evidence should be collected, archived\
    \ and\n   preserved according to local legislation.\n"
- title: 2.2.7. Incident
  contents:
  - "2.2.7. Incident\n   An Incident is a security event that involves a security\
    \ violation.\n   An incident can be defined as a single attack or a group of attacks\n\
    \   that can be distinguished from other attacks by the method of attack,\n  \
    \ identity of attackers, victims, sites, objectives or timing, etc.\n   An incident\
    \ is a root element of the IODEF. In the context of IODEF,\n   the term Incident\
    \ is used to mean a Computer Security Incident or an\n   IT Security Incident.\n\
    \   However we should distinguish between the generic definition of\n   'Incident'\
    \ which is an event that might lead to damage or damage\n   which is not too serious,\
    \ and 'Security Incident' and 'IT Security\n   Incident' which are defined below:\n\
    \   a) Security incident is an event that involves a security violation.\n   \
    \   This may be an event that violates a security policy, UAP, laws\n      and\
    \ jurisdictions, etc. A security incident may also be an\n      incident that\
    \ has been escalated to a security incident.\n      A security incident is worse\
    \ than an incident as it affects the\n      security of or in the organisation.\
    \ A security incident may be\n      logical, physical or organisational, for example\
    \ a computer\n      intrusion, loss of secrecy, information theft, fire or an\
    \ alarm\n      that doesn't work properly.  A security incident may be caused\
    \ on\n      purpose or by accident.  The latter may be if somebody forgets to\n\
    \      lock a door or forgets to activate an access list in a router.\n   b) An\
    \ IT security incident is defined according to [9] as any real or\n      suspected\
    \ adverse event in relation to the security of a computer\n      or computer network.\
    \  Typical security incidents within the IT\n      area are: a computer intrusion,\
    \ a denial-of-service attack,\n      information theft or data manipulation, etc.\n"
- title: 2.2.8. Impact
  contents:
  - "2.2.8. Impact\n   Impact describes result of attack expressed in terms of user\n\
    \   community, for example the cost in terms of financial or other\n   disruption\n"
- title: 2.2.9. Target
  contents:
  - "2.2.9. Target\n   A computer or network logical entity (account, process or data)\
    \ or\n   physical entity (component, computer, network or internetwork).\n"
- title: 2.2.10. Victim
  contents:
  - "2.2.10. Victim\n   Victim is individual or organisation which suffered the attack\
    \ which\n   is described in incident report.\n   For the purpose of IODEF victim\
    \ is described by its network ID,\n   organisation and location information.\n"
- title: 2.2.11. Vulnerability
  contents:
  - "2.2.11. Vulnerability\n   A flaw or weakness in a system's design, implementation,\
    \ or operation\n   and management that could be exploited to violate the system's\n\
    \   security policy.\n   Most systems have vulnerabilities of some sort, but this\
    \ does not\n   mean that the systems are too flawed to use.  Not every threat\n\
    \   results in an attack, and not every attack succeeds.  Success depends\n  \
    \ on the degree of vulnerability, the strength of attacks, and the\n   effectiveness\
    \ of any countermeasures in use.  If the attacks needed\n   to exploit a vulnerability\
    \ are very difficult to carry out, then the\n   vulnerability may be tolerable.\
    \  If the perceived benefit to an\n   attacker is small, then even an easily exploited\
    \ vulnerability may be\n   tolerable.  However, if the attacks are well understood\
    \ and easily\n   made, and if the vulnerable system is employed by a wide range\
    \ of\n   users, then it is likely that there will be enough benefit for\n   someone\
    \ to make an attack.\n"
- title: 2.2.12. Other terms
  contents:
  - "2.2.12. Other terms\n   Other terms used: alert, activity, IDS, Security Policy,\

    \ Internet.\n   Current standards provide framework for compatibility of IODEF\
    \ with\n   other related technologies necessary to operate /implement IODEF in\n\
    \   practice.  Another issue of compatibility for the IODEF is its\n   general\
    \ compatibility with IDEF currently being developed by IETF\n   IDEWG.  In the\
    \ interest of time and compatibility, defined and\n   accepted standards should\

  contents:
  - "4.1. IODEF shall support full internationalization and localization.\n   Comment:\n\
    \   Since some Incidents need involvement of CSIRTs from different\n   countries,\
    \ cultural and geographic regions, the IODEF description\n   must be formatted\
    \ such that they can be presented to an operator in a\n   local language and adhering\
    \ to local presentation formats.\n   Although metalanguage for IODEF identifiers\
    \ and labels is considered\n   to be English, a local IODEF implementation might\
    \ be capable to\n   translate metalanguage identifiers and labels into local language\
    \ and\n   presentations if necessary.\n   Localized presentation of dates, time\
    \ and names may also be required.\n   In cases where the messages contain text\
    \ strings and names that need\n   characters other than Latin-1 (or ISO 8859-1),\
    \ the information\n   preferably should be represented using the ISO/IEC IS 10646-1\n\

  - "4.2. The IODEF must support modularity in Incident description to\n     allow\
    \ aggregation and filtering of data.\n   Comment:\n   It is suggested that Incident\
    \ description with IODEF might include\n   external information, e.g., from IDS,\
    \ or reference externally stored\n   evidence custody data, or such information\
    \ might be removed from\n   current IODEF description, e.g., in purposes of privacy\
    \ or security.\n   Another practical/real life motivation for this requirement\
    \ is to\n   give possibility for some CSIRTs/managers to perform filtering and/or\n\
    \   data aggregation functions on IODEF descriptions for the purposes of\n   statistics,\
    \ reporting and high level Incident information exchange\n   between CSIRTs and/or\
    \ their constituency and sponsors.\n   Therefore the IODEF descriptions MUST be\
    \ structured to facilitate\n   these operations.  This also implies to strong\

  contents:
  - "4.3. IODEF must support the application of an access restriction\n     policy\
    \ attribute to every element.\n   Comment:\n   IODEF Incident descriptions potentially\
    \ contain sensitive or private\n   information (such as passwords, persons/organisations\
    \ identifiers or\n   forensic information (evidence data)) and in some cases may\
    \ be\n   exposed to non-authorised persons.  Such situations may arise\n   particularly\
    \ in case of Incident information exchange between CSIRTs\n   or other involved\
    \ bodies.  Some cases may be addressed by encrypting\n   IODEF elements, however\
    \ this will not always be possible.\n   Therefore, to prevent accidental disclosure\
    \ of sensitive data, parts\n   of the IODEF object must be marked with access\
    \ restriction\n   attributes.  These markings will be particularly useful when\

    \ taken in the course of this incident by previous CSIRTs.\n   Comment:\n   The\
    \ IODEF describes an Incident throughout its life-time from Alert\n   to closing\
    \ and archiving.  It is essential to track all actions taken\n   by all involved\
    \ parties.  This will help determine what further\n   action needs to be taken,\
    \ if any.  This is especially important in\n   case of Incident information exchange\
    \ between CSIRTs in process of\n   investigation.\n"

  contents:
  - "6.12. The IODEF must support reporting of the time of all stages\n      along\
    \ Incident life-time.\n   Comment:\n   Time is important from both a reporting\
    \ and correlation point of\n   view.  Time is one of main components that can\
    \ identify the same\n   Incident or attack if launched from many sites or distributed\
    \ over\n   the network.  Time is also essential to be able to track the life of\n\
    \   an Incident including Incident exchange between CSIRTs in process of\n   investigating.\n"

  contents:
  - "6.13. Time shall be reported as the local time and time zone offset\n      from\
    \ UTC.  (Note: See RFC 1902 for guidelines on reporting time.)\n   Comment:\n\
    \   For event correlation purposes, it is important that the manager be\n   able\
    \ to normalize the time information reported in the IODEF\n   descriptions.\n"

  contents:
  - "6.14. The format for reporting the date must be compliant with all\n      current\
    \ standards for Year 2000 rollover, and it must have\n      sufficient capability\
    \ to continue reporting date values past the\n      year 2038.\n   Comment:\n\
    \   It is stated in the purposes of the IODEF that the IODEF shall\n   describe\
    \ the Incident throughout its life-time.  In the case of\n   archiving this duration\
    \ might be unlimited.  Therefore,\n   implementations that limit expression of\
    \ time value (such as 2038\n   date representation limitation in \"Unix time\"\
    ) MUST be avoided.\n"
- title: 6.15. Time granularity in IO time parameters shall not be specified
  contents:
  - "6.15. Time granularity in IO time parameters shall not be specified\n      by\
    \ the IODEF.\n   Comment:\n   The time data may be included into IODEF description\
    \ by existing\n   information systems, retrieved from incident reporting messages\
    \ or\n   taken from IDS data or other event registration tools.  Each of these\n\
    \   cases may have its own different time granularity.  For the purposes\n   of\
    \ implementation, it should be possible to handle time at different\n   stages\
    \ according to the local system capabilities.\n"
- title: 6.16. The IODEF should support confidentiality of the description
  contents:
  - "6.16. The IODEF should support confidentiality of the description\n      content.\n\
    \   The selected design should be capable of supporting a variety of\n   encryption\
    \ algorithms and must be adaptable to a wide variety of\n   environments.\n  \
    \ Comment:\n   IODEF Incident descriptions potentially contain sensitive or private\n\
    \   information (such as forensic data (evidence data), passwords, or\n   persons/organisations\
    \ identifiers) which would be of great interest\n   to an attacker or malefactor.\
    \  Incident information normally will be\n   stored on a networked computer, which\
    \ potentially may be exposed to\n   attacks (or compromised).  Incident information\
    \ may be transmitted\n   across uncontrolled network segments.  Therefore, it\
    \ is important\n   that the content be protected from unauthorised access and\n\
    \   modification.  Furthermore, since the legal environment for privacy\n   and\
    \ encryption technologies are varied from regions and countries and\n   change\
    \ often, it is important that the design selected be capable of\n   supporting\
    \ a number of different encryption options and be adaptable\n   by the user to\
    \ a variety of environments. Additional measures may be\n   undertaken for securing\
    \ the Incident during communication but this\n   issue is outside of IODEF scope\
    \ as it implies more strict rules for\n   IO archiving and storing in general.\n"

    \ Comment:\n   Special measures should be undertaken to prevent malicious IO\n\
    \   changes.\n   Additional measures may be undertaken for securing the Incident\n\
    \   during communication but this issue is outside of IODEF scope.\n"
- title: 6.18. The IODEF should ensure the authenticity and non-repudiation
  contents:
  - "6.18. The IODEF should ensure the authenticity and non-repudiation\n      of\
    \ the message content.\n   Comment:\n   Authenticity and accountability is needed\
    \ by many teams, especially\n   given the desire to automatically handle IOs,\
    \ therefore it MUST be\n   included in the IODEF.  Because of the importance of\
    \ IO authenticity\n   and non-repudiation to many teams and especially in case\
    \ of\n   communication between them, the implementation of these requirements\n\
    \   is strongly RECOMMENDED.\n"
- title: 6.19. The IODEF description must support an extension mechanism
  contents:
  - "6.19. The IODEF description must support an extension mechanism\n      which\
    \ may be used by implementers.  This allows future\n      implementation-specific\
    \ or experimental data.  The implementer\n      MUST indicate how to interpret\
    \ any included extensions.\n   Comment:\n   Implementers might wish to supply\
    \ extra data such as information for\n   internal purposes or necessary for the\
    \ particular implementation of\n   their Incident handling system.  These data\
    \ may be removed or not in\n   external communications but it is essential to\
    \ mark them as\n   additional to prevent wrong interpretation by different systems.\n"
- title: 6.20. The semantics of the IODEF description must be well defined.
  contents:
  - "6.20. The semantics of the IODEF description must be well defined.\n   Comment:\n\
    \   IODEF is a human oriented format for Incident description, and IODEF\n   description\
    \ should be capable of being read by humans.  The use of\n   automatic parsing\
    \ tools is foreseen but should not be critically\n   necessary.  Therefore, IODEF\
    \ must provide  good semantics, which will\n   be  key to understanding what the\
    \ description contains.  In some\n   cases the IODEF description will be used\
    \ for  automatic decision\n   making, so it is important that the description\
    \ be interpreted\n   correctly.  This is an argument for using language-based\
    \ semantics.\n   The metalanguage for IODEF identifiers and labels is proposed\
    \ to be\n   English, a local IODEF implementation might be able to translate\n\
    \   metalanguage identifiers and labels into local language and\n   presentations\
    \ if necessary.\n"
