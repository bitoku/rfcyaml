- title: Introduction
  contents:
  - "Introduction\n   There have been several proposals for schemes to allow the use\
    \ of a\n   single Internet network number to refer to a collection of physical\n\
    \   networks under common administration which are reachable from the\n   rest\
    \ of the Internet by a common route.  Such schemes allow a\n   simplified view\
    \ of an otherwise complicated topology from hosts and\n   gateways outside of\
    \ this collection.  They allow the complexity of\n   the number and  type of these\
    \ networks, and routing to them, to be\n   localized.  Additions and changes in\
    \ configuration thus cause no\n   detectable change, and no interruption of service,\
    \ due to slow\n   propagation of routing and other information outside of the\
    \ local\n   environment.  These schemes also simplify the administration of the\n\
    \   network, as changes do not require allocation of new network numbers\n   for\
    \ each new cable installed.  The motivation for explicit or\n   implicit subnets,\
    \ several of the alternatives, and descriptions of\n   existing implementations\
    \ of this type have been described in detail\n   [1,2].  This proposal discusses\
    \ an alternative scheme, one that has\n   been in use at the University of California,\
    \ Berkeley since\n   April 1984.\n"
- title: Subnet Addressing at Berkeley
  contents:
  - "Subnet Addressing at Berkeley\n   As in the proposal by Jeff Mogul in RFC-917,\
    \ the Berkeley subnet\n   addressing utilizes encoding of the host part of the\
    \ Internet\n   address.  Hosts and gateways on the local network are able to\n\
    \   determine the subnet number from each local address, and then route\n   local\
    \ packets based on the subnet number.  Logically, the collection\n   of subnets\
    \ appears to external sites to be a single, homogenous\n   network.  Internally,\
    \ however, each subnet is distinguished from the\n   others and from other networks,\
    \ and internal routing decisions are\n   based on the subnet rather than the network\
    \ number.\n   The encoding of subnet addresses is similar to that proposed in\n\
    \   RFC-917.  In decomposing an Internet address into the network and\n   host\
    \ parts, the algorithm is modified if the network is \"local\", that\n   is, if\
    \ the network is a directly-connected network under local\n   administrative control.\
    \  (Networks are marked as local or non-local\n"

    \ address is set at boot time.)\n   For local addresses, the host part is examined\
    \ for a subnet number.\n   Local addresses may be on the main network, or they\
    \ may be on a\n   subnet.  The high-order bit of the host number is used to distinguish\n\
    \   between subnets and the main net.  If the high-order bit of the host\n   field\
    \ is set, then the remainder of the high-order byte of the host\n   part is taken\
    \ to be the subnet number.  If the high-order bit is\n   clear, then the address\
    \ is interpreted in the normal fashion.  For\n   Class A networks, using 8-bit\
    \ subnet fields, this allows a network\n   with up to 127 subnets, each of 65535\
    \ hosts maximum, and a main net\n   with 2^23 hosts.  Class B nets may include\
    \ 127 subnets, each of up to\n   255 hosts, and 32767 hosts on the main net. \
    \ Class C networks are not\n   currently included in this scheme. They might be\
    \ reasonably be added,\n   using four bits of the host part for a subnet desgination\
    \ and four\n   bits for the host, allowing 8 subnets of 15 hosts and 126 hosts\
    \ on\n   the main net.\n   The current implementation does not use subnet numbers\
    \ separately\n   from the network field, but instead treats the subnet field as\
    \ an\n   extension of the network field.  Functions that previously returned\n\
    \   the network number from an address now return a network or\n   network-subnetwork\
    \ number.  Conveniently, Class A subnets are\n   distinguishable from Class B\
    \ networks, although each is a 16-bit\n   quantity, and Class B subnets are disjoint\
    \ with Class C network\n   numbers.  The net result is that subnets appear to\
    \ be separate,\n   independent networks with their own routing entries within\
    \ the\n   network, but outside of the network, they are invisible.  There is no\n\
    \   current facility at Berkeley for broadcasting on the logical network;\n  \
    \ broadcasting may be done on each subnet that uses harware capable of\n   broadcast.\n"
- title: Discussion
  contents:
  - "Discussion\n   There have been several earlier proposals for methods of allowing\n\
    \   several physical networks to share an Internet network designation,\n   and\
    \ to provide routing within this logical network.  RFC-917 proposes\n   a means\
    \ for encoding the host part of each local address such that\n   the hosts, or\
    \ the gateways connecting them, are able to determine the\n   physical network\
    \ for the host.  The current proposal is most similar\n   to that scheme; the\
    \ differences are discussed in detail below.\n   Another proposal (RFC-925) involves\
    \ the use of intelligent gateways\n   to perform routing for unmodified hosts,\
    \ using an Address Resolution\n   Protocol (ARP) [2].  This has the advantage\
    \ of placing all\n   modifications in the gateways, but is likely to require additional\n\
    \   routing protocols and caching mechanisms in the gateways in order to\n   avoid\
    \ excessive broadcasts for address resolution.  A modification of\n"

- title: Another Internet Subnet Addressing Scheme
  contents:
  - "Another Internet Subnet Addressing Scheme\n   this method is to perform encoding\
    \ of subnets within host addresses\n   by convention to simplify the routing in\
    \ the gateways, without\n   modifying host software to recognize these subnet\
    \ addresses.  These\n   techniques were not considered for use at Berkeley, because\
    \ all\n   packet forwarding was being done by multi- homed hosts, all of which\n\
    \   ran the same software as the singly-homed hosts (4.2BSD Unix).\n   The most\
    \ recent proposal, RFC-932 [3], provides subnetting by\n   encoding the network\
    \ part of the Internet address rather than the\n   host part.  Ordinary hosts\
    \ need not know of this convention,\n   eliminating the need for modification\
    \ to host software.  Gateways\n   would be able to take advantage of this encoding\
    \ to compress the\n   routing information for the collection of networks into\
    \ a single\n   entry.  Unfortunately, implementation of that scheme would require\
    \ a\n   fairly concerted transition by the gateways of the Internet, or the\n\
    \   transition period would be likely to overflow the routing tables in\n   the\
    \ existing gateways.  All of the hosts on the larger networks would\n   be forced\
    \ to change addresses from their current Class A or B\n   addresses to \"B 1/2\"\
    \ addresses.  There are a limited number (4096) of\n   blocks of Class C addresses\
    \ available using this encoding.  The\n   number of universities and other organizations\
    \ having already\n   implemented subnets or contemplating their installation argues\
    \ for a\n   more extensible scheme, as well as one that can be implemented more\n\
    \   quickly.\n   The current proposal is most similar to that of RFC-917; indeed,\
    \ the\n   two implementations are nearly compatible.  There are two differences\n\
    \   of significance.  First, the use of a bit to distinguish subnetted\n   addresses\
    \ from non-subnetted addresses allows both smaller subnets\n   and a larger (physical\
    \ or logical) main network.  Half of the host\n   addresses within a Class A or\
    \ B network are reserved for use in\n   subnets, the other half are available\
    \ for the primary net.  This may\n   useful when using a hardware medium that\
    \ is capable of supporting\n   large numbers of hosts or for transparent subnetting\
    \ (e.g. using\n   ARP-based bridges).  The corresponding disadvantage is that\
    \ fewer\n   subnets may be supported.  The allocation of bits between the subnet\n\
    \   number and the host field could be adjusted, but for Class B\n   networks,\
    \ neither is excessively large.  Given the limited address\n   space of the current\
    \ Internet addressing, this is a difficult choice.\n   The second difference is\
    \ that the width of the subnet field is fixed\n   in advance.  This simplifies\
    \ the already-too-complicated code to\n   interpret Internet addresses, and avoids\
    \ the bootstrap problem. If\n   the subnet field width is to be determined dynamically,\
    \ some fraction\n   of the hosts on a network must be prepared to specify this\
    \ value, and\n   the situation will be unworkable if one of these hosts does not\
    \ make\n   the correct choice or none are accessible when other machines come\n"
