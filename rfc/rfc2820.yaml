  - "Abstract\n   This document describes the fundamental requirements of an access\n\
    \   control list (ACL) model for the Lightweight Directory Application\n   Protocol\
    \ (LDAP) directory service.  It is intended to be a gathering\n   place for access\
    \ control requirements needed to provide authorized\n   access to and interoperability\
    \ between directories.\n   The keywords \"MUST\", \"SHOULD\", and \"MAY\" used\
    \ in this document are to\n   be interpreted as described in [bradner97].\n"
- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   The ability to securely access (replicate and distribute)\
    \ directory\n   information throughout the network is necessary for successful\n\
    \   deployment.  LDAP's acceptance as an access protocol for directory\n   information\
    \ is driving the need to provide an access control model\n   definition for LDAP\
    \ directory content among servers within an\n   enterprise and the Internet. \
    \ Currently LDAP does not define an\n   access control model, but is needed to\
    \ ensure consistent secure\n   access across heterogeneous LDAP implementations.\
    \  The requirements\n   for access control are critical to the successful deployment\
    \ and\n   acceptance of LDAP in the market place.\n   The RFC 2119 terminology\
    \ is used in this document.\n"
- title: 2.  Objectives
  contents:
  - "2.  Objectives\n   The major objective is to provide a simple, but secure, highly\n\
    \   efficient access control model for LDAP while also providing the\n   appropriate\
    \ flexibility to meet the needs of both the Internet and\n   enterprise environments\
    \ and policies.\n   This generally leads to several general requirements that\
    \ are\n   discussed below.\n"
- title: 3.  Requirements
  contents:
  - "3.  Requirements\n   This section is divided into several areas of requirements:\
    \ general,\n   semantics/policy, usability, and nested groups (an unresolved issue).\n\
    \   The requirements are not in any priority order.  Examples and\n   explanatory\
    \ text is provided where deemed necessary.  Usability is\n   perhaps the one set\
    \ of requirements that is generally overlooked, but\n   must be addressed to provide\
    \ a secure system. Usability is a security\n   issue, not just a nice design goal\
    \ and requirement. If it is\n   impossible to set and manage a policy for a secure\
    \ situation that a\n   human can understand, then what was set up will probably\
    \ be non-\n   secure. We all need to think of usability as a functional security\n\
    \   requirement.\n"
- title: 3.1  General
  contents:
  - "3.1  General\n   G1.  Model SHOULD be general enough to support extensibility\
    \ to add\n   desirable features in the future.\n   G2.  When in doubt, safer is\
    \ better, especially when establishing\n   defaults.\n   G3.  ACL administration\
    \ SHOULD be part of the LDAP protocol.  Access\n   control information MUST be\
    \ an LDAP attribute.\n   G4.  Object reuse protection SHOULD be provided and MUST\
    \ NOT inhibit\n   implementation of object reuse. The directory SHOULD support\
    \ policy\n   controlling the re-creation of deleted DNs, particularly in cases\n\
    \   where they are re-created for the purpose of assigning them to a\n   subject\
    \ other than the owner of the deleted DN.\n"
- title: 3.2  Semantics / Policy
  contents:
  - "3.2  Semantics / Policy\n   S1.  Omitted as redundant; see U8.\n   S2.  More\
    \ specific policies must override less specific ones (e.g.\n   individual user\
    \ entry in ACL SHOULD take precedence over group entry)\n   for the evaluation\
    \ of an ACL.\n   S3.  Multiple policies of equal specificity SHOULD be combined\
    \ in\n   some easily-understood way (e.g. union or intersection).  This is\n \
    \  best understood by example.  Suppose user A belongs to 3 groups and\n   those\
    \ 3 groups are listed on the ACL. Also suppose that the\n   permissions for each\
    \ of those groups are not identical. Each group is\n   of equal specificity (e.g.\
    \ each group is listed on the ACL) and the\n   policy for granting user A access\
    \ (given the example) SHOULD be\n   combined in some easily understood way, such\
    \ as by intersection or\n   union.  For example, an intersection policy here may\
    \ yield a more\n   limited access for user A than a union policy.\n   S4.  Newly\
    \ created directory entries SHOULD be subject to a secure\n   default policy.\n\
    \   S5.  Access policy SHOULD NOT be expressed in terms of attributes\n   which\
    \ the directory administrator or his organization cannot\n   administer (e.g.\
    \ groups whose membership is administered by another\n   organization).\n   S6.\
    \  Access policy SHOULD NOT be expressed in terms of attributes\n   which are\
    \ easily forged (e.g. IP addresses).  There may be valid\n   reasons for enabling\
    \ access based on attributes that are easily\n   forged and the behavior/implications\
    \ of doing that should be\n   documented.\n   S7.  Humans (including administrators)\
    \ SHOULD NOT be required to\n   manage access policy on the basis of attributes\
    \ which are not\n   \"human-readable\" (e.g. IP addresses).\n   S8.  It MUST be\
    \ possible to deny a subject the right to invoke a\n   directory operation.  The\
    \ system SHOULD NOT require a specific\n   implementation of denial (e.g.  explicit\
    \ denial, implicit denial).\n   S9.  The system MUST be able (semantically) to\
    \ support either\n   default-grant or default-deny semantics (not simultaneously).\n\
    \   S10.  The system MUST be able to support either union semantics or\n   intersection\
    \ semantics for aggregate subjects (not simultaneously).\n   S11.  Absence of\
    \ policy SHOULD be interpretable as grant or deny.\n   Deny takes precedence over\
    \ grant among entries of equal specificity.\n   S12.  ACL policy resolution MUST\
    \ NOT depend on the order of entries\n   in the ACL.\n   S13.  Rights management\
    \ MUST have no side effects.  Granting a\n   subject one right to an object MUST\
    \ NOT implicitly grant the same or\n   any other subject a different right to\
    \ the same object.  Granting a\n   privilege attribute to one subject MUST NOT\
    \ implicitly grant the same\n   privilege attribute to any other subject.  Granting\
    \ a privilege\n   attribute to one subject MUST NOT implicitly grant a different\n\
    \   privilege attribute to the same or any other subject.  Definition: An\n  \
    \ ACL's \"scope\" is defined as the set of directory objects governed by\n   the\
    \ policy it defines; this set of objects is a sub-tree of the\n   directory. \
    \ Changing the policy asserted by an ACL (by changing one\n   or more of its entries)\
    \ MUST NOT implicitly change the policy\n   governed by an ACL in a different\
    \ scope.\n   S14.  It SHOULD be possible to apply a single policy to multiple\n\
    \   directory entries, even if those entries are in different subtrees.\n   Applying\
    \ a single policy to multiple directory entries SHOULD NOT\n   require creation\
    \ and storage of multiple copies of the policy data.\n   The system SHOULD NOT\
    \ require a specific implementation (e.g. nested\n   groups, named ACLs) of support\
    \ for policy sharing.\n"
- title: 3.3  Usability (Manageability)
  contents:
  - "3.3  Usability (Manageability)\n   U1.  When in doubt, simpler is better, both\
    \ at the interface and in\n   the implementation.\n   U2.  Subjects MUST be drawn\
    \ from the \"natural\" LDAP namespace; they\n   should be DNs.\n   U3.  It SHOULD\
    \ NOT be possible via ACL administration to lock all\n   users, including all\
    \ administrators, out of the directory.\n   U4.  Administrators SHOULD NOT be\
    \ required to evaluate arbitrary\n   Boolean predicates in order to create or\
    \ understand policy.\n   U5.  Administrators SHOULD be able to administer access\
    \ to\n   directories and their attributes based on their sensitivity, without\n\
    \   having to understand the semantics of individual schema elements and\n   their\
    \ attributes (see U9).\n   U6.  Management of access to resources in an entire\
    \ subtree SHOULD\n   require only one ACL (at the subtree root).  Note that this\
    \ makes\n   access control based explicitly on attribute types very hard, unless\n\
    \   you constrain the types of entries in subtrees.  For example, another\n  \
    \ attribute is added to an entry. That attribute may fall outside the\n   grouping\
    \ covered by the ACL and hence require additional\n   administration where the\
    \ desired affect is indeed a different ACL.\n   Access control information specified\
    \ in one administrative area MUST\n   NOT have jurisdiction in another area. \
    \ You SHOULD NOT be able to\n   control access to the aliased entry in the alias.\
    \  You SHOULD be able\n   to control access to the alias name.\n   U7.  Override\
    \ of subtree policy MUST be supported on a per-\n   directory-entry basis.\n \
    \  U8.  Control of access to individual directory entry attributes (not\n   just\
    \ the whole directory entry) MUST be supported.\n   U9.  Administrator MUST be\
    \ able to coarsen access policy granularity\n   by grouping attributes with similar\
    \ access sensitivities.\n   U10.  Control of access on a per-user granularity\
    \ MUST be supported.\n   U11.  Administrator MUST be able to aggregate users (for\
    \ example, by\n   assigning them to groups or roles) to simplify administration.\n\
    \   U12.  It MUST be possible to review \"effective access\" of any user,\n  \
    \ group, or role to any entry's attributes. This aids the administrator\n   in\
    \ setting the correct policy.\n   U13.  A single administrator SHOULD be able\
    \ to define policy for the\n   entire directory tree.  An administrator MUST be\
    \ able to delegate\n   policy administration for specific subtrees to other users.\
    \  This\n   allows for the partitioning of the entire directory tree for policy\n\
    \   administration, but still allows a single policy to be defined for\n   the\
    \ entire tree independent of partitioning.  (Partition in this\n   context means\
    \ scope of administration). An administrator MUST be able\n   to create new partitions\
    \ at any point in the directory tree, and MUST\n   be able to merge a superior\
    \ and subordinate partition.  An\n   administrator MUST be able to configure whether\
    \ delegated access\n   control information from superior partitions is to be accepted\
    \ or\n   not.\n   U14.  It MUST be possible to authorize users to traverse directory\n\
    \   structure even if they are not authorized to examine or modify some\n   traversed\
    \ entries; it MUST also be possible to prohibit this.  The\n   tree structure\
    \ MUST be able to be protected from view if so desired\n   by the administrator.\n\
    \   U15.  It MUST be possible to create publicly readable entries, which\n   may\
    \ be read even by unauthenticated clients.\n   U16.  The model for combining multiple\
    \ access control list entries\n   referring to a single individual MUST be easy\
    \ to understand.\n   U17.  Administrator MUST be able to determine where inherited\
    \ policy\n   information comes from, that is, where ACLs are located and which\n\
    \   ACLs were applied. Where inheritance of ACLs is applied, it must be\n   able\
    \ to be shown how/where that new ACL is derived from.\n   U18.  It SHOULD be possible\
    \ for the administrator to configure the\n   access control system to permit users\
    \ to grant additional access\n   control rights for entries which they create.\n"

  - "5.  Glossary\n   This glossary is intended to aid the novice not versed in depth\
    \ about\n   access control.  It contains a list of terms and their definitions\n\
    \   that are commonly used in discussing access control [emca].\n   Access control\
    \ - The prevention of use of a resource by unidentified\n   and/or unauthorized\
    \ entities in any other that an authorized manner.\n   Access control list - A\
    \ set of control attributes.  It is a list,\n   associated with a security object\
    \ or a group of security objects.\n   The list contains the names of security\
    \ subjects and the type of\n   access that may be granted.\n   Access control\
    \ policy - A set of rules, part of a security policy, by\n   which human users,\
    \ or their representatives, are authenticated and by\n   which access by these\
    \ users to applications and other services and\n   security objects is granted\
    \ or denied.\n   Access context - The context, in terms of such variables as location,\n\
    \   time of day, level of security of the underlying associations, etc.,\n   in\
    \ which an access to a security object is made.\n   Authorization - The granting\
    \ of access to a security object.\n   Authorization policy - A set of rules, part\
    \ of an access control\n   policy, by which access by security subjects to security\
    \ objects is\n   granted or denied.  An authorization policy may be defined in\
    \ terms\n   of access control lists, capabilities, or attributes assigned to\n\
    \   security subjects, security objects, or both.\n   Control attributes - Attributes,\
    \ associated with a security object\n   that, when matched against the privilege\
    \ attributes of a security\n   subject, are used to grant or deny access to the\
    \ security object.  An\n   access control list or list of rights or time of day\
    \ range are\n   examples of control attributes.\n   Credentials - Data that serve\
    \ to establish the claimed identity of a\n   security subject relative to a given\
    \ security domain.\n   Privilege attributes - Attributes, associated with a security\
    \ subject\n   that, when matched against control attributes of a security object,\n\
    \   are used to grant or deny access to that subject.  Group and role\n   memberships\
    \ are examples of privilege attributes.\n   Security attributes - A general term\
    \ covering both privilege\n   attributes and control attributes.  The use of security\
    \ attributes is\n   defined by a security policy.\n   Security object - An entity\
    \ in a passive role to which a security\n   policy applies.\n   Security policy\
    \ - A general term covering both access control\n   policies and authorization\
    \ policies.\n   Security subject - An entity in an active role to which a security\n\
    \   policy applies.\n"
