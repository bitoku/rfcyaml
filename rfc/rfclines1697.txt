This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB) for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
In particular, it describes managed objects used for managing relational database (RDBMS) implementations.
The SNMPv2 Network Management Framework
Network Management Framework consists of four major components.
They are: RFC 1442 [1] which defines the SMI, the mechanisms used for describing and naming objects for the purpose of management.
[2] defines MIB II, the core set of managed objects for the Internet suite of protocols.
RFC 1445 [3] which defines the administrative and other architectural aspects of the framework.
RFC 1448 [4] which defines the protocol used for network access to managed objects.
RFC 1443 [5] which describes textual conventions for the framework.
The framework permits new objects to be defined for the purpose of experimentation and evaluation.
In particular, the RDBMS MIB can be seen as an extension of RFC 1565 [6] which defines the MIB for monitoring network service applications.
Object Definitions Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed the Management Information Base or MIB.
Objects in the MIB are defined using the subset of Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1) defined in the SMI.
In particular, each object type is named by an OBJECT IDENTIFIER, an administratively assigned name.
The object type together with an object instance serves to uniquely identify a specific instantiation of the object.
For human convenience, we often use a textual string, termed the descriptor, to refer to the object type.
The RDBMS MIB contains objects that may be used to manage relational database implementations.
Specifically, it contains information on installed databases, servers, and on the relation of databases and servers.
The terms used in this database are described below.
Terminology Vendors and Products are providers of database systems on a host.
These vendors may have more than one database product that is manageable through this MIB.
On a host, there may be systems from multiple vendors, multiple systems from a single vendor, or any other combination.
There may be a private MIB for each vendor, and this may be located using the PrivateMibOID objects in some of the tables.
Databases are collections of interrelated data organized according to a schema to serve one or more applications.
A database is, for purposes of this MIB, a collection of tables whose organization is based on the relational model.
There may be one or more databases available in each system on the host from each product.
In the MIB, data about databases is captured in the rdbmsDbTable and the rdbmsDbInfoTable, each with one row per database.
Relational Database Management System (RDBMS)
A collection of integrated services which support database management and together support and control the creation, use and maintenance of relational databases.
Servers as defined in this MIB provide the functions of the RDBMS.
Servers are entities that provide access to databases.
For this MIB, servers are defined to be entities that may exist independently of other servers.
A server may or may not be a single process, based on its independence from other processes.
In this MIB, information about servers is captured in the rdbmsSvrTable, the rdbmsSvrInfoTable, each with one row per server extending the applTable from the APPLICATION MIB of RFC 1565.
The rdbmsSvrTable and rdbmsSvrInfoTable are both indexed by the applIndex of that MIB.
Associations Inbound associations are local or remote conversations, usually instances of the SQL CONNECT statement, as made visible in servers.
The MIB does not currently reveal individual associations; there are association counters in the dbmsSvrInfoTable and the applTable.
There are also relationships between servers and databases.
many servers    many databases : 1 server    many databases : many servers 3.2.
Structure and Features The information in this MIB module is organized into nine tables, twelve potentially writable objects, and two traps, as follows.
They are far from adequate for detailed management or performance monitoring of specific database products.
This gap is expected to be filled with vendor and product specific MIBs addressing the entities that have not been codified here.
Writable objects The MIB requires no writable objects for conformance.
There is no expectation that RDBMS systems may be actively managed through this MIB.
However, the RDBMS MIB supports the capability to modify the following objects if the implementor so chooses.

The MIB module to describe objects for generic relational databases."
"The table of databases installed on a system."
An entry for a single database on the host.
Whether a particular database is represented by a row in rdbmsDbTable may be dependent on the activity level of that database, according to the product's implementation.
An instance of rdbmsRelState having the value active, other, or restricted implies that an entry, corresponding to that instance, will be present.
A numeric index, unique among all the databases from all products on this host.
{ rdbmsDbEntry  1 } rdbmsDbPrivateMibOID    OBJECT
If no OBJECT IDENTIFIER exists for the private MIB, attempts to access this object will return noSuchName (SNMPv1) or noSuchInstance (SNMPv2)."
{ rdbmsDbEntry  2 } rdbmsDbVendorName   OBJECT TYPE SYNTAX
"The name of the vendor whose RDBMS manages this database, for informational purposes."
The name of this database, in a product specific format.
The product may need to qualify the name in some way to resolve conflicts if it is possible for a database name to be duplicated on a host.
It might be necessary to construct a hierarchical name embedding the RDBMS instance/installation on the host,
and/or the owner of the database.
For instance, '/test installation/database owner/database name'."
The textual identification of the contact person for this managed database, together with information on how to contact this person.
Note: if there is no server associated with this database, an agent may need to keep this in other persistent storage, e.g., a configuration file.
Note that a compliant agent does not need to allow write access to this object."
"The table of additional information about databases present on the host."
current DESCRIPTION "Information that must be present if the database is actively opened.
If the database is not actively opened, then attempts to access corresponding instances in this table may result in either noSuchName

The format is product specific."
"The version number of the server that created or last restructured this database.
The format is product specific."
, kbytes(2), mbytes(3), gbytes(4), tbytes(5)
bytes(1) indicates individual bytes, kbytes(2) indicates units of kilobytes, mbytes(3) indicates units of megabytes, gbytes(4) indicates units of gigabytes, and tbytes(5) indicates units of terabytes.
If writable, changes here are reflected in the get values of the associated objects."
The estimated size of this database (in rdbmsDbInfoSizeUnits), which is the disk space that has been allocated to it and is no longer available to users on this host.
rdbmsDbInfoSize does not necessarily indicate the amount of space actually in use for database data.
Some databases may support extending allocated size, and others may not.
Note that a compliant agent does not need to allow write access to this object."
"The estimated size of this database, in rdbmsDbInfoSizeUnits, which is actually in use for database data."
The date and time that the latest complete or partial backup of the database was taken.
If a database has never been backed up, then attempts to access this object will result in either noSuchName
The table of configuration parameters for a database.
Entries should be populated according to the following guidelines: (1)
The value should be specified through administrative (human) intervention.
(2) It should be configured on a per database basis.
(3) One of the following is true: (a)
The parameter has a non numeric value; (b)
The current value is numeric, but it only changes due to human intervention; (c)
The current value is numeric and dynamic, but the RDBMS does not track access/allocation failures related to the parameter; (d)
The current value is numeric and dynamic, the RDBMS tracks changes in access/allocation failures related to the parameter, but the failure has no significant impact on RDBMS performance or availability.
The current value is numeric and dynamic, the RDBMS tracks changes in access/allocation failures related to the parameter, the failure has significant impact on RDBMS performance or availability, and is shown in the rdbmsDbLimitedResource table."
An entry for a single configuration parameter for a database.
Parameters with single values have a subindex value of one.
If the parameter is naturally considered to contain a variable number of members of a class, e.g.  members of the DBA user group, or files which are part of the database, then it must be presented as a set of rows.
If, on the other hand, the parameter represents a set of choices from a class, e.g. the permissions on a file or the options chosen out of the set of all options allowed, AND is guaranteed to always fit in the 255 character length of a DisplayString, then it may be presented as a comma separated list with a subindex value of one.
Zero may not be used as a subindex value.
If the database is not actively opened, then attempts to access corresponding instances in this table may result in either noSuchName
(SNMPv1) or noSuchInstance (SNMPv2). '
at least one of the rdbmsRelState entries for this database in the rdbmsRelTable is active(2).
The name of a configuration parameter for a database.
This name is product specific.
The length is limited to 64 characters to constrain the number of sub identifiers needed for instance identification (and to minimize network traffic)."

The ID of the parameter which may be described in some other MIB (e.g., an enterprise specific MIB module).
If there is no ID for this rdbmsDbParamName, attempts to access this object will return noSuchName (SNMPv1) or noSuchInstance (SNMPv2)."
"The value for a configuration parameter now in effect, the actual setting for the database.
While there may multiple values in the temporal domain of interest (for instance, the value to take effect at the next restart), this is the current setting.
Note that a compliant agent does not need to allow write access to this object."
current DESCRIPTION "Annotation which describes the purpose of a configuration parameter or the reason for a particular parameter's setting.
Note that a compliant agent does not need to allow write access to this object."
"The table of limited resources that are kept per database."
An entry for a single limited resource kept per database.
A limited resource has maximum use determined by a parameter that might or might not be changeable at run time, or visible in the rdbmsDbParamTable.
Examples would be the number of available locks, or disk space on a partition.
Arrays of resources are supported through an integer sub index, which should have the value of one for single instance names.
Limited resources that are shared across databases, are best put in the rdbmsSvrLimitedResourceTable instead of this one.
If the database is not actively opened, then attempts to access corresponding instances in this table may result in either noSuchName
(SNMPv1) or noSuchInstance (SNMPv2). '
at least one of the rdbmsRelState entries for this database in the rdbmsRelTable is active(2).
"The name of the resource, for instance 'global locks' or 'locks for the FOO database', or 'data space on /dev/rdsk/5s0 for FOO'.
The length is limited to 64 characters to constrain the number of sub identifiers needed for instance identification (and to minimize network traffic)."
The ID of the resource which may be described in some other MIB (e.g., an enterprise specific MIB module).
If there is no ID for this rdbmsDbLimitedResourceName, attempts to access this object will return noSuchName (SNMPv1) or noSuchInstance (SNMPv2)."
"The maximum value the resource use may attain.
Note that a compliant agent does not need to allow write access to this object."
The current value for the resource."
"The maximum value of the resource seen since applUpTime was reset for the earliest server which has the database actively opened.
If there are two servers with the database open, and the oldest one dies, the proper way to invalidate the value is by resetting sysUpTime."
"The number of times the system wanted to exceed the limit of the resource since applUpTime was reset for the earliest server which has the database actively opened.
If there are two servers with the DB open, and the oldest one dies, the proper way to invalidate the value is by resetting sysUpTime."
A description of the resource and the meaning of the integer units used for Limit, Current, and Highwater.
Note that a compliant agent does not need to allow write access to this object."
SEQUENCE OF RdbmsSrvEntry MAX ACCESS
"The table of database servers running or installed on a system."
An entry for a single database server.
A server is an independent entity that provides access to one or more databases.
Failure of one does not affect access to databases through any other servers.
There might be one or more servers providing access to a database.
A server may be a 'process' or collection of 'processes', as interpreted by the product.
If no OBJECT IDENTIFIER exists for the private MIB, attempts to access this object will return noSuchName (SNMPv1) or noSuchInstance (SNMPv2)."
"The name of the vendor whose RDBMS manages this database, for informational purposes."
The product name of this server.
This is normally the vendor's formal name for the product, in product specific format."
} rdbmsSrvContact OBJECT TYPE SYNTAX
The textual identification of the contact person for this managed server, together with information on how to contact this person.
Note: if there is no active server associated with this object, an agent may need to keep this in other persistent storage, e.g., a configuration file.
Note that a compliant agent does not need to allow write access to this object."
"The table of additional information about database servers.
Entries in this table correspond to applications in the APPLICATION MIB applTable.
Some objects in that table are application specific.
When they are associated with an RDBMS server in this table, the objects have the following meanings.
The name of this server, i.e., the process or group of processes providing access to this database.
The exact format will be product and host specific.
The version number of this server, in product specific format.
applOperStatus up(1) means operational and available for general use.
down(2) means the server is not available for use, but is known to the agent.
The other states have broad meaning, and may need to be supplemented by the vendor private MIB.
Halted(3) implies an administrative state of unavailability.
Congested(4) implies a resource or or administrative limit is prohibiting new inbound associations.
The 'available soon' description of restarting(5) may include an indeterminate amount of recovery.
applLastChange is the time the agent noticed the most recent change to applOperStatus.
applInboundAssociation is the number of currently active local and remote conversations (usually SQL connects).
applOutboundAssociations is not provided by this MIB.
applAccumulatedInboundAssociations is the total number of local and remote conversations started since the server came up.
applAccumulatedOutbound associations is not provided by this MIB.
applLastInboundActivity is the time the most recent local or remote conversation was attempted or disconnected.
applLastOutboundActivity is not provided by this MIB.
applRejectedInboundAssociations is the number of local or remote conversations rejected by the server for administrative reasons or because of resource limitations.
applFailedOutboundAssociations is not provided by this MIB."
current DESCRIPTION "Information that must be present for a single 'up' database server, with visibility determined by the value of the corresponding applOperStatus object.
If an instance of applOperStatus is not up(1), then attempts to access corresponding instances in this table may result in either noSuchName
being returned by the agent.
The date and time at which this server was last started."
"The number of transactions visible to this server that have been completed by either commit or abort.
Some database operations, such as read only queries, may not result in the creation of a transaction."
"The total number of reads of database files issued to the operating system by this server since startup.
Numbers are not comparable between products.
What constitutes a readand how it is accounted is product specific."
{ rdbmsSrvInfoEntry 3 } rdbmsSrvInfoLogicalReads    OBJECT TYPE SYNTAX
The total number of logical reads of database files made internally by this server since startup.
The values of this object and those of rdbmsSrvInfoDiskReads reveal the effect of caching on read operation.
Numbers are not comparable between products, and may only be meaningful when aggregated across all servers sharing a common cache."
"The total number of writes to database files issued to the operating system by this server since startup.
Numbers are not comparable between products."
"The total number of times parts of the database files have been marked 'dirty' and in need of writing to the disk.
rdbmsSrvInfoDiskWrites give some indication of the effect of 'write behind' strategies in reducing the number of disk writes compared to database operations.
Because the writes may be done by servers other than those marking the parts of the database
files dirty, these values may only be meaningful when aggregated across all servers sharing a common cache.
Numbers are not comparable between products."
"The total number of pages in database files read by this server since startup.
'Pages' are product specific units of disk i/o operations.
This value, along with rdbmsSrvInfoDiskReads, reveals the effect of any grouping read ahead that may be used to enhance performance of some queries, such as scans."
"The total number of pages in database files written by this server since startup.
Pages are product specific units of disk I/
This value, with rdbmsSrvInfoDiskWrites, shows the effect of write strategies that collapse logical writes of contiguous pages into single calls to the operating system."
The total number of times the server has been unable to obtain disk space that it wanted, since server startup.
This would be inspected by an agent on receipt of an rdbmsOutOfSpace trap."
"The total number of requests made to the server on inbound associations.
The meaning of 'requests' is product specific, and is not comparable between products.
This is intended to encapsulate high level semantic operations between clients and servers, or between peers.
For instance, one request might correspond to a 'select' or an 'insert' statement.
It is not intended to capture disk i/
o described in rdbmsSrvInfoDiskReads and rdbmsSrvInfoDiskWrites."
"The number of receive operations made processing any requests on inbound associations.
The meaning of operations is product specific, and is not comparable between products.
This is intended to capture lower level i/o operations than shown by HandledRequests, between clients and servers, or between peers.
For instance, it might roughly correspond to the amount of data given with an 'insert' statement.
It is not intended to capture disk i/
o described in rdbmsSrvInfoDiskReads and rdbmsSrvInfoDiskWrites."
"The number of send operations made processing requests handled on inbound associations.
The meaning of operations is product specific, and is not comparable between products.
This is intended to capture lower level i/o operations than shown by HandledRequests, between between clients and servers, or between peers.
It might roughly correspond to the number of rows returned by a 'select' statement.

An entry for a single configuration parameter for a server.
Parameters with single values have a subindex value of one.
If the parameter is naturally considered to contain a variable number of members of a class, e.g.  members of the DBA user group, or tracepoints active in the server, then it must be presented as a set of rows.
If, on the other hand, the parameter represents a set of choices from a class, e.g. the permissions on a file or the options chosen out of the set of all options allowed, AND is guaranteed to always fit in the 255 character length of a DisplayString, then it may be presented as a comma separated list with a subindex value of one.
Zero may not be used as a subindex value.
Entries for a server must be present if the value of the corresponding applOperStatus object is up(1).
If an instance of applOperStatus is not up(1), then attempts to access corresponding instances in this table may result in either noSuchName

SEQUENCE OF RdbmsRelEntry MAX ACCESS
current DESCRIPTION "A table relating databases and servers present on a host."
An entry relating a single database server to a single database to which it may provide access.
The table is indexed first by the index of rdbmsDbTable, and then rdbmsSrvTable, so that all servers capable of providing access to a given database may be found by SNMP traversal operations (get next and get bulk).
The makeup of this table depends on the product's architecture, e.g. if it is one server many databases, then each server will appear n times, where n is the number of databases it may access, and each database will appear once.
If the architecture is one database many servers, then each server will appear once and each database will appear n times, where n is the number of servers that may be accessing it.
The state of this server's access to this database.
Active(2) means the server is actively using the database.
Available(3) means the server could use the database if necessary.
Restricted(4) means the database is in some administratively determined state of less than complete availability.
Unavailable(5) means the database is not available through this server.
Other(1) means the database/server is in some other condition, possibly described in the vendor private MIB."
"The time the database was made active by the server.
If an instance of rdbmsRelState is not active(1), then attempts to access the corresponding instance of this object may result in either noSuchName

{ rdbmsMIB 2 } rdbmsStateChange    NOTIFICATION TYPE OBJECTS
An rdbmsStateChange trap signifies that one of the database server/databases managed by this agent has changed its rdbmsRelState in a way that makes it less accessible for use.
For these purposes, both active(2) and available(3) are considered fully accessible.
The state sent with the trap is the new, less accessible state."
An rdbmsOutOfSpace trap signifies that one of the database servers managed by this agent has been unable to allocate space for one of the databases managed by this agent.
Care should be taken to avoid flooding the network with these traps."
