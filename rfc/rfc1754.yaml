  - "3.  Introduction\n   The following is the charter statement from the Internet\
    \ Engineering\n   Task Force's (IETF) IP over ATM Working Group (IPATM WG).  It\
    \ is\n   being reproduced here for the benefit of those in the ATM Forum who\n\
    \   may not be familiar with it:\n   \"The IP over ATM Working Group will focus\
    \ on the issues involved in\n   running internetworking protocols over Asynchronous\
    \ Transfer Mode\n   (ATM) networks.  The final goal for the Working Group is to\
    \ produce\n   standards for the TCP/IP protocol suite and recommendations which\n\
    \   could be used by other internetworking protocol standards (e.g., ISO\n   CLNP\
    \ and IEEE 802.2 Bridging).\n   The Working Group will initially develop experimental\
    \ protocols for\n   encapsulation, multicasting, addressing, address resolution,\
    \ call set\n   up, and network management to allow the operation of internetwork\n\
    \   protocols over an ATM network.  The Working Group may later submit\n   these\
    \ protocols for IETF standardization.\n   The Working Group will not develop physical\
    \ layer standards for ATM.\n   These are well covered in other standards groups\
    \ and do not need to\n   be addressed in this Group.\n   The Working Group will\
    \ develop models of ATM internetworking\n   architectures.  This will be used\
    \ to guide the development of\n   specific IP over ATM protocols.\n   The Working\
    \ Group will also develop and maintain a list of technical\n   unknowns that relate\
    \ to internetworking over ATM.  These will be used\n   to direct future work of\
    \ the Working Group or be submitted to other\n   standards or research groups\
    \ as appropriate.\n   The Working Group will coordinate its work with other relevant\n\
    \   standards bodies (e.g., ANSI T1S1.5) to insure that it does not\n   duplicate\
    \ their work and that its work meshes well with other\n   activities in this area.\
    \  The Working Group will select among ATM\n   protocol options (e.g., selection\
    \ of an adaptation layer) and make\n   recommendations to the ATM standards bodies\
    \ regarding the\n   requirements for internetworking over ATM where the current\
    \ ATM\n   standards do not meet the needs of internetworking.\"\n   Historically,\
    \ a large number of IETF IPATM WG participants are\n   employees of companies\
    \ who are principal members of the ATM Forum.\n   Requirements between the two\
    \ organizations have been communicated\n   informally by these participants. \
    \ With the establishment of the ATM\n   Forum's Multiprotocol BOF activities,\
    \ it has become prudent now to\n   document IETF requirements in a more formal\
    \ fashion.\n   At the July 1994 meeting of the IETF in Toronto, Canada, a request\n\
    \   was presented to the IP over ATM Working Group by the ATM Forum\n   Liaison,\
    \ Drew Perkins, for the working group to prepare a list of\n   requirements as\
    \ input to the ATM Forum's Multiprotocol BOF\n   activities.  This document is\
    \ a response to that request.\n"

  contents:
  - "4.1  Standardization & Logistics\n      - Formal communications between the IETF\
    \ and the ATM Forum\n        should be made via IETF <> ATM Forum Liaison(s),\
    \ specific\n        written communications (such as this document), and/or\n \
    \       presentations made at official IETF or ATM Forum meetings.\n      - IETF\
    \ standards define how the TCP/IP protocol suite is defined,\n        deployed,\
    \ and carried over specific network technologies,\n        including ATM networks\
    \ [1][2][8].\n      - Any formal communications that affect the IETF standards\n\
    \        or processes must be made publicly available as the IETF is\n       \
    \ a public international standards body.  Ideally, such\n        communications\
    \ should be written as Internet Drafts [1], the\n        IETF's equivalent to\
    \ incoming contributions.\n      - We invite and encourage ATM Forum members to\
    \ participate in\n        the IETF standards process.  See [1], [2], and [8] for\n\
    \        information on how to participate.\n"
- title: 4.2  IPv4 Encapsulation
  contents:
  - "4.2  IPv4 Encapsulation\n      - RFC 1483 [3] and RFC 1577 [4] define how IP\
    \ is encapsulated\n        and carried over ATM networks.  The IPATM WG requests\
    \ that any\n        ATM Forum Multiprotocol work support these standards as\n\
    \        specified, and that any future changes to them be made via the\n    \
    \    IETF standards process.\n"
- title: 4.3 Routing
  contents:
  - "4.3 Routing\n      - RFC 1577 defines the default Logical IP Subnet (LIS) model.\n\
    \      - The IETF Routing over Large Clouds Working Group is developing\n    \
    \    the Next Hop Resolution Protocol, which allows the incremental\n        optimization\
    \ of routing (and subnets) by routing datagrams\n        over preferential ATM\
    \ paths [9].\n      - The IETF IP over ATM Working Group will be working on the\n\
    \        next generation IP over ATM standards after RFC 1577 moves\n        from\
    \ draft to proposed status.  Requirements to the ATM\n        Forum will be forthcoming.\n\
    \      - ATM signaling should give an indication of connection\n        over LAN\
    \ or WAN and include feedback of time vs byte\n        charging.\n"
- title: 4.4  Security
  contents:
  - "4.4  Security\n      - ATM signaling should support a user information element\n\
    \        that is used to convey security and authentication information\n    \
    \    between IP members and applications.  The IETF IPATM WG would\n        like\
    \ to define the IP specific content of this IE.\n"
- title: 4.5  Broadcast and Multicast
  contents:
  - "4.5  Broadcast and Multicast\n      - The IPATM WG is currently discussing models\
    \ of how best to map\n        IP multicast facilities onto ATM facilities.  While\
    \ this work is\n        preliminary, the IETF does support the ATM Forum's currently\n\
    \        planned multicasting enhancements, such as leaf-initiated joins\n   \
    \     and support of multiple multicast congestion management\n        policies.\
    \  A further list of requirements will be presented at a\n        later time.\n"
- title: 4.6  Signaling and Addressing
  contents:
  - "4.6  Signaling and Addressing\n      - The IPATM WG is currently producing a\
    \ specification for using\n        UNI 3.0 and 3.1 signaling to support RFCs 1483\
    \ and 1577.  This\n        specification will be published as an informational\
    \ reference\n        for UNI 3.0 signaling, and as a proposed standard for UNI\
    \ 3.1\n        signaling following UNI 3.1's ratification and official\n     \
    \   publication.\n      - IPv6 packets will include a Flow ID field intended to\
    \ support\n        service classes in some way. Until the semantics of this field\n\
    \        are fully defined it is hard to say much, but presumably a soft\n   \
    \     mapping between this and the VC to be used is desirable.  A\n        further\
    \ list of requirements will be presented at a later time.\n      - IPv6 addresses\
    \ will be 16 bytes and there will likely be a\n        defined embedding of them\
    \ inside 20-byte NSAP format. There will\n        also likely be a mapping of\
    \ US-GOSIP-like NSAPs into IPv6\n        addresses (deleting the unuseful bytes),\
    \ but that is still\n        controversial in the IPv6 discussions.  A further\
    \ list of\n        requirements will be presented at a later time.\n"

  - "4.7  Quality of Service, Performance, and Traffic Management\n      - ATM should\
    \ support extremely bursty applications with\n        significant elasticity in\
    \ their bandwidth demands.\n      - ATM should support elastic applications as\
    \ defined in\n        RFC-1633 [7] very efficiently.  That means enable high\n\
    \        bottleneck utilization while keeping delay reasonably bounded\n     \
    \   (i.e., doubling delay wouldn't be terrible for elastic apps).\n        This\
    \ should not be at the expense of delay sensitive classes\n        of service.\n\
    \      - ATM should provide a a class of service which strives to\n        cooperate\
    \ with existing TCP congestion avoidance, thereby\n        explicitly providing\
    \ support not only for directly ATM-attached\n        and -aware endstations,\
    \ but also for endstations on LANs (or\n        using LAN Emulation) that are\
    \ using current TCP implementations\n        and interconnected via ATM-attached\
    \ bridges and routers.\n      - Predictive QoS should be supported in addition\
    \ to guaranteed QoS\n        to support applications which are somewhat tolerant\
    \ of delay\n        variation and low levels of loss.\n      - IP uses both point-to-point\
    \ and point-to-multipoint (future)\n        connections.  To satisfy IP's needs\
    \ an ABR-like service\n        would need to be applicable to both types of connections\
    \ [6].\n      - No specification of minimum or maximum bandwidths by the ATM\n\
    \        end-systems [6].\n      - As simple as possible [6].\n      - Full line-rate\
    \ transmission over otherwise-idle links [6].\n      - When end-to-end delay through\
    \ the network is less than 1 second,\n        the cell loss for AAL5 frames over\
    \ an ABR-like service should be\n        on the order of 3 in 10**8 cells for\
    \ 1500 byte frames, or 3 in\n        10**9 cells for 18 Kbyte frames [6].\n"
