- title: Introduction
  contents:
  - "Introduction\n   The IEEE 802 project has defined a family of standards for Local\
    \ Area\n   Networks (LANs) that deals with the Physical and Data Link Layers as\n\
    \   defined by the ISO Open System Interconnection Reference Model\n   (ISO/OSI).\
    \  Several Physical Layer standards (802.3, 802.4, and\n   802.5) [2, 3, 4] and\
    \ one Data Link Layer Standard (802.2) [5] have\n   been defined.  The IEEE Physical\
    \ Layer standards specify the ISO/OSI\n   Physical Layer and the Media Access\
    \ Control Sublayer of the ISO/OSI\n   Data Link Layer.  The 802.2 Data Link Layer\
    \ standard specifies the\n   Logical Link Control Sublayer of the ISO/OSI Data\
    \ Link Layer.\n   The 802.3 standard is based on the Ethernet Version 2.0 standard\
    \ [6].\n   The Ethernet Physical Layer and the 802.3 Physical Layer are\n   compatible\
    \ for all practical purposes however, the Ethernet Data Link\n   Layer and the\
    \ 802.3/802.2 Data Link Layer are incompatible.\n   There are many existing Ethernet\
    \ network installations that transmit\n   IP datagrams using the Ethernet compatible\
    \ standard described in [7].\n   IEEE 802.3 Physical Layer compatible connections\
    \ can be added to\n   these networks using an an Ethernet Data Link Layer compatible\
    \ method\n   for transmitting IP datagrams without violating the 802.3 standard.\n\
    \   Alternatively, an 802.2/802.3 Data Link Layer compatible method for\n   transmitting\
    \ IP datagrams can be used.\n"

  - "Ethernet Compatible Method\n   IEEE 802.3 networks must use 48-bit physical addresses\
    \ and 10\n   megabit/second bandwidth in order to be Ethernet compatible.\n  \
    \ The IEEE 802.3 packet header is identical to Ethernet packet header\n   except\
    \ for the meaning assigned to one of the fields in the header.\n   In an Ethernet\
    \ packet header this field is used as a protocol type\n   field and in an 802.3\

    \  The 802.3 standard states that packets with a\n   length field greater than\
    \ the maximum allowed length field may be\n   ignored, discarded, or used in a\

    \ Address Mappings\n      The mapping of 32-bit Internet addresses to 16-bit or\
    \ 48-bit 802.3\n      addresses can be done in several ways.  A static table could\
    \ be\n      used, or a dynamic discovery procedure could be used.\n      Static\
    \ Table\n         Each host could be provided with a table of all other hosts\
    \ on\n         the local network with both their 802.3 and Internet addresses.\n\
    \      Dynamic Discovery\n         Mappings between 32-bit Internet addresses\
    \ and 802.3 addresses\n         could be accomplished through a protocol similar\
    \ to the\n         Ethernet Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) [10].  Internet\n\
    \         addresses are assigned arbitrarily on some Internet networks.\n    \
    \     Each host's implementation must know its own Internet address\n        \
    \ and respond to 802.3 Address Resolution packets appropriately.\n         It\
    \ should also use ARP to translate Internet addresses to 802.3\n         addresses\
    \ when needed.\n      Broadcast Address\n         The broadcast Internet address\
    \ (the address on that network\n         with a host part of all binary ones)\

    \ with the VAX virtual\n      memory architecture.  Consenting systems on the\

- title: Conclusion
  contents:
  - "Conclusion\n   The two encapsulation methods presented can be mixed on the same\n\
    \   local area network; however, this would partition the network into\n   two\
    \ incompatible subnetworks.  One host on a network could support\n   both methods\
    \ and act as a gateway between the two subnetworks;\n   however, this would introduce\
    \ a significant performance penalty and\n   should be avoided.\n   The IEEE 802.2/802.3\
    \ compatible encapsulation method is preferable to\n   the Ethernet compatible\
    \ method because the IEEE 802.2 and IEEE 802.3\n   standards have been accepted\
    \ both nationally and internationally and\n   because the same encapsulation method\
    \ could be used on other IEEE 802\n   Physical Layer implementations.  However,\
    \ there are many existing\n   installations that are using IP on Ethernet and\
    \ a controlled\n   transition from Ethernet to IEEE 802.2/802.3 is necessary.\n\
    \   To this end, all new implementations should allow for a static choice\n  \
    \ of encapsulation methods and all existing implementations should be\n   modified\
    \ to provide this static choice as well.  During the\n   transition, all hosts\
    \ on the same network would use the Ethernet\n   compatible method.  After 802.2/802.3\
    \ support has been added to all\n   existing implementations, the IEEE 802.2/802.3\
    \ method would be used\n   and the transition would be complete.\n"
