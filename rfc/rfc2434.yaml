- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   Many protocols make use of fields that contain constants\
    \ and other\n   well-known values (e.g., the Protocol field in the IP header [IP]\
    \ or\n   MIME types in mail messages [MIME-REG]). Even after a protocol has\n\
    \   been defined and deployment has begun, new values may need to be\n   assigned\
    \ (e.g., a new option type in DHCP [DHCP] or a new encryption\n   or authentication\
    \ algorithm for IPSec [IPSEC]).  To insure that such\n   fields have consistent\
    \ values and interpretations in different\n   implementations, their assignment\
    \ must be administered by a central\n   authority. For IETF protocols, that role\
    \ is provided by the Internet\n   Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA).\n   In this\
    \ document, we call the set of possible values for such a field\n   a \"name space\"\
    ; its actual content may be a name, a number or another\n   kind of value. The\
    \ assignment of a specific value to a name space is\n   called an assigned number\
    \ (or assigned value). Each assignment of a\n   number in a name space is called\
    \ a registration.\n   In order for the IANA to manage a given name space prudently,\
    \ it\n   needs guidelines describing the conditions under which new values\n \
    \  should be assigned. This document provides guidelines to authors on\n   what\
    \ sort of text should be added to their documents, and reviews\n   issues that\
    \ should be considered in formulating an appropriate policy\n   for assigning\
    \ numbers to name spaces.\n   Not all name spaces require centralized administration.\
    \  In some\n   cases, it is possible to delegate a name space in such a way that\n\
    \   further assignments can be made independently and with no further\n   (central)\
    \ coordination. In the Domain Name System, for example, the\n   IANA only deals\
    \ with assignments at the higher-levels, while\n   subdomains are administered\
    \ by the organization to which the space\n   has been delegated. As another example,\
    \ Object Identifiers (OIDs) as\n   defined by the ITU are also delegated [ASSIGNED].\
    \  When a name space\n   can be delegated, the IANA only deals with assignments\
    \ at the top\n   level.\n   This document uses the terms 'MUST', 'SHOULD' and\
    \ 'MAY', and their\n   negatives, in the way described in RFC 2119 [KEYWORDS].\
    \ In this case,\n   \"the specification\" as used by RFC 2119 refers to the processing\
    \ of\n   protocols being submitted to the IETF standards process.\n"
- title: 2.  Issues To Consider
  contents:
  - "2.  Issues To Consider\n   The primary issue to consider in managing a name space\
    \ is its size.\n   If the space is small and limited in size, assignments must\
    \ be made\n   carefully to insure that the space doesn't become exhausted. If\
    \ the\n   space is essentially unlimited, on the other hand, it may be\n   perfectly\
    \ reasonable to hand out new values to anyone that wants one.\n   Even when the\
    \ space is essentially unlimited, however, it is usually\n   desirable to have\
    \ a minimal review to prevent the hoarding of or\n   unnecessary wasting of a\
    \ space. For example, if the space consists of\n   text strings, it may be desirable\
    \ to prevent organizations from\n   obtaining large sets of strings that correspond\
    \ to the \"best\" names\n   (e.g., existing company names).\n   A second consideration\
    \ is whether it makes sense to delegate the name\n   space in some manner. This\
    \ route should be pursued when appropriate,\n   as it lessens the burden on the\
    \ IANA for dealing with assignments.\n   In some cases, the name space is essentially\
    \ unlimited, and assigned\n   numbers can safely be given out to anyone. When\
    \ no subjective review\n   is needed, the IANA can make assignments directly,\
    \ provided that the\n   IANA is given specific instructions on what types of requests\
    \ it\n   should grant, and what information must be provided before a request\n\
    \   for an assigned number will be considered. Note that the IANA will\n   not\
    \ define an assignment policy; it should be given a set of\n   guidelines that\
    \ allow it to make allocation decisions with little\n   subjectivity.\n   In most\
    \ cases, some review of prospective allocations is appropriate,\n   and the question\
    \ becomes who should perform the review and how\n   rigorous the review needs\
    \ to be.  In many cases, one might think that\n   an IETF Working Group (WG) familiar\
    \ with the name space at hand\n   should be consulted. In practice, however, WGs\
    \ eventually disband, so\n   they cannot be considered a permanent evaluator.\
    \ It is also possible\n   for name spaces to be created through individual submission\n\
    \   documents, for which no WG is ever formed.\n   One way to insure community\
    \ review of prospective assignments is to\n   have the requester submit a document\
    \ for publication as an RFC. Such\n   an action insures that the IESG and relevant\
    \ WGs review the\n   assignment. This is the preferred way of insuring review,\
    \ and is\n   particularly important if any potential interoperability issues can\n\
    \   arise. For example, many assignments are not just assignments, but\n   also\
    \ involve an element of protocol specification. A new option may\n   define fields\
    \ that need to be parsed and acted on, which (if\n   specified poorly) may not\
    \ fit cleanly with the architecture of other\n   options or the base protocols\
    \ on which they are built.\n   In some cases, however, the burden of publishing\
    \ an RFC in order to\n   get an assignment is excessive. However, it is generally\
    \ still useful\n   (and sometimes necessary) to discuss proposed additions on\
    \ a mailing\n   list dedicated to the purpose (e.g., the ietf-types@iana.org for\n\
    \   media types) or on a more general mailing list (e.g., that of a\n   current\
    \ or former IETF WG).  Such a mailing list provides a way for\n   new registrations\
    \ to be publicly reviewed prior to getting assigned,\n   or to give advice for\
    \ persons who want help in understanding what a\n   proper registration should\
    \ contain.\n   While discussion on a mailing list can provide valuable technical\n\
    \   expertise, opinions may vary and discussions may continue for some\n   time\
    \ without resolution.  In addition, the IANA cannot participate in\n   all of\
    \ these mailing lists and cannot determine if or when such\n   discussions reach\
    \ consensus.  Therefore, the IANA cannot allow\n   general mailing lists to fill\
    \ the role of providing definitive\n   recommendations regarding a registration\
    \ question.  Instead, the IANA\n   will use a designated subject matter expert.\
    \  The IANA will rely on a\n   \"designated expert\" to advise it in assignment\
    \ matters.  That is, the\n   IANA forwards the requests it receives to a specific\
    \ point-of-contact\n   (one or a small number of individuals) and acts upon the\
    \ returned\n   recommendation from the designated expert. The designated expert\
    \ can\n   initiate and coordinate as wide a review of an assignment request as\n\
    \   may be necessary to evaluate it properly.\n   Designated experts are appointed\
    \ by the relevant Area Director of the\n   IESG. They are typically named at the\
    \ time a document that creates a\n   new numbering space is published as an RFC,\
    \ but as experts originally\n   appointed may later become unavailable, the relevant\
    \ Area Director\n   will appoint replacements if necessary.\n   Any decisions\
    \ made by the designated expert can be appealed using the\n   normal IETF appeals\
    \ process as outlined in Section 6.5 of [IETF-\n   PROCESS]. Since the designated\
    \ experts are appointed by the IESG,\n   they may be removed by the IESG.\n  \
    \ The following are example policies, some of which are in use today:\n      Private\
    \ Use - For private or local use only, with the type and\n           purpose defined\
    \ by the local site. No attempt is made to\n           prevent multiple sites\
    \ from using the same value in different\n           (and incompatible) ways.\
    \ There is no need for IANA to review\n           such assignments and assignments\
    \ are not generally useful for\n           interoperability.\n           Examples:\
    \ Site-specific options in DHCP [DHCP] have\n           significance only within\
    \ a single site.  \"X-foo:\" header\n           lines in email messages.\n   \
    \   Hierarchical allocation - Delegated managers can assign values\n         \
    \  provided they have been given control over that part of the\n           name\
    \ space.  IANA controls the higher levels of the namespace\n           according\
    \ to one of the other policies.\n           Examples: DNS names, Object Identifiers\n\
    \      First Come First Served - Anyone can obtain an assigned number, so\n  \
    \         long as they provide a point of contact and a brief\n           description\
    \ of what the value would be used for.  For\n           numbers, the exact value\
    \ is generally assigned by the IANA;\n           with names, specific names are\
    \ usually requested.\n           Examples: vnd. (vendor assigned) MIME types [MIME-REG],\
    \ TCP\n           and UDP port numbers.\n      Expert Review - approval by a Designated\
    \ Expert is required.\n      Specification Required - Values and their meaning\
    \ must be\n           documented in an RFC or other permanent and readily available\n\
    \           reference, in sufficient detail so that interoperability\n       \
    \    between independent implementations is possible.\n           Examples: SCSP\
    \ [SCSP]\n      IESG Approval - New assignments must be approved by the IESG,\
    \ but\n           there is no requirement that the request be documented in an\n\
    \           RFC (though the IESG has discretion to request documents or\n    \
    \       other supporting materials on a case-by-case basis).\n      IETF Consensus\
    \ - New values are assigned through the IETF\n           consensus process. Specifically,\
    \ new assignments are made via\n           RFCs approved by the IESG. Typically,\
    \ the IESG will seek\n           input on prospective assignments from appropriate\
    \ persons\n           (e.g., a relevant Working Group if one exists).\n      \
    \     Examples: SMTP extensions [SMTP-EXT], BGP Subsequent Address\n         \
    \  Family Identifiers [BGP4-EXT].\n      Standards Action - Values are assigned\
    \ only for Standards Track\n           RFCs approved by the IESG.\n          \
    \ Examples: MIME top level types [MIME-REG]\n   It should be noted that it often\
    \ makes sense to partition a name\n   space into several categories, with assignments\
    \ out of each category\n   handled differently. For example, the DHCP option space\
    \ [DHCP] is\n   split into two parts. Option numbers in the range of 1-127 are\n\
    \   globally unique and assigned according to the Specification Required\n   policy\
    \ described above, while options number 128-254 are \"site\n   specific\", i.e.,\
    \ Local Use. Dividing the name space up makes it\n   possible to allow some assignments\
    \ to be made with minimal review,\n   while simultaneously reserving some part\
    \ of the space for future use.\n"
- title: 3.  Registration maintenance
  contents:
  - "3.  Registration maintenance\n   Registrations are a request for an assigned\
    \ number, including the\n   related information needed to evaluate and document\
    \ the request. Even\n   after a number has been assigned, some types of registrations\
    \ contain\n   additional information that may need to be updated over time. For\n\
    \   example, mime types, character sets, language tags, etc. typically\n   include\
    \ more information than just the registered value itself.\n   Example information\
    \ can include point of contact information,\n   security issues, pointers to updates,\
    \ literature references, etc.  In\n   such cases, the document must clearly state\
    \ who is responsible for\n   maintaining and updating a registration. It is appropriate\
    \ to:\n      - Let the author update the registration, subject to the same\n \
    \       constraints and review as with new registrations.\n      - Allow some\
    \ mechanism to attach comments to the registration, for\n        cases where others\
    \ have significant objections to claims in a\n        registration, but the author\
    \ does not agree to change the\n        registration.\n      - Designate the IESG\
    \ or another authority as having the right to\n        reassign ownership of a\
    \ registration. This is mainly to get\n        around the problem when some registration\
    \ owner cannot be\n        reached in order to make necessary updates.\n"
- title: 4.  What To Put In Documents
  contents:
  - "4.  What To Put In Documents\n   The previous sections presented some issues\
    \ that should be considered\n   in formulating a policy for assigning well-known\
    \ numbers and other\n   protocol constants. It is the Working Group and/or document\
    \ author's\n   job to formulate an appropriate policy and specify it in the\n\
    \   appropriate document. In some cases, having an \"IANA Considerations\"\n \
    \  section may be appropriate. Specifically, documents that create an\n   name\
    \ space (or modify the definition of an existing space) and that\n   expect the\
    \ IANA to play a role in maintaining that space (e.g.,\n   serving as a repository\
    \ for registered values) MUST document the\n   process through which future assignments\
    \ are made.  Such a section\n   MUST state clearly:\n      - whether or not an\
    \ application for an assigned number needs to be\n        reviewed. If review\
    \ is necessary, the review mechanism MUST be\n        specified.  When a Designated\
    \ Expert is used, documents MUST NOT\n        name the Designated Expert in the\
    \ document itself; instead, the\n        name should be relayed to the appropriate\
    \ IESG Area Director at\n        the time the document is sent to the IESG for\
    \ approval.\n      - If the request should also be reviewed on a specific public\n\
    \        mailing list (such as the ietf-types@iana.org for media types),\n   \
    \     that mailing address should be specified. Note, however, that\n        use\
    \ of a Designated Expert MUST also be specified.\n      - if the IANA is expected\
    \ to make assignments without requiring an\n        outside review, sufficient\
    \ guidance MUST be provided so that the\n        requests can be evaluated with\
    \ minimal subjectivity.\n   Authors SHOULD attempt to provide guidelines that\
    \ allow the IANA to\n   assign new values directly without requiring review by\
    \ a Designated\n   Expert. This can be done easily in many cases by designating\
    \ a range\n   of values for direct assignment by the IANA while simultaneously\n\
    \   reserving a sufficient portion of the name space for future use by\n   requiring\
    \ that assignments from that space be made only after a more\n   stringent review.\n\
    \   Finally, it is quite acceptable to pick one of the example policies\n   cited\
    \ above and refer to it by name.  For example, a document could\n   say something\
    \ like:\n        Following the policies outlined in [IANA-CONSIDERATIONS],\n \
    \       numbers in the range 0-63 are allocated as First Come First\n        Served,\
    \ numbers between 64-240 are allocated through an IETF\n        Consensus action\
    \ and values in the range 241-255 are reserved\n        for Private Use.\n   For\
    \ examples of documents that provide good and detailed guidance to\n   the IANA\
    \ on the issue of assigning numbers, consult [MIME-REG, MIME-\n   LANG].\n"

  contents:
  - "5.  Applicability to Past and Future RFCs\n   For all existing RFCs that either\
    \ explicitly or implicitly rely on\n   the IANA to evaluate assignments without\

    \ what policy is\n   appropriate. The default policy has been first come, first\

- title: 6.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "6.  Security Considerations\n   Information that creates or updates a registration\
    \ needs to be\n   authenticated.\n   Information concerning possible security\
    \ vulnerabilities of a\n   protocol may change over time. Likewise, security vulnerabilities\n\
    \   related to how an assigned number is used (e.g., if it identifies a\n   protocol)\
    \ may change as well. As new vulnerabilities are discovered,\n   information about\
    \ such vulnerabilities may need to be attached to\n   existing registrations,\
    \ so that users are not mislead as to the true\n   security issues surrounding\
    \ the use of a registered number.\n   An analysis of security issues is required\
    \ for all parameters (data\n   types, operation codes, keywords, etc.) used in\
    \ IETF protocols or\n   registered by the IANA. All descriptions of security issues\
    \ must be\n   as accurate as possible regardless of level of registration.  In\n\
    \   particular, a statement that there are \"no security issues associated\n \
    \  with this type\" must not given when it would be more accurate to\n   state\
    \ that \"the security issues associated with this type have not\n   been assessed\"\
