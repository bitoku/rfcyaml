  - "                        PROPOSED TELNET CHANGES\n   The proposed change to the\
    \ TELNET protocol calling for one standard\nprotocol and dropping the idea of\
    \ minimum implementation seems\nreasonable at this time.\n   I suggest that both\
    \ Data Types and Hide Your Input be kept for the\nfollowing reasons:\n   Data\
    \ Types:\nThe objection stating that switching out of ASCII results in an\nirreversible\
    \ change and loss of control can be met by requiring other\ncodes to provide to\
    \ a return to ASCII.  Each other code may have its\nown return code, however,\
    \ it may not always be employed.  Other codes\nare important for alphanumeric\
    \ terminals that have special devices\nattached.  Several potential cases can\
    \ be cited:\n   1.  Cal comp plotter attached to a teletype has logic permitting\
    \ a\n       program to turn the plotter on and off.  When operating I believe\n\
    \       it uses an 8 bit code which could conflict with Telnet signals.\n   2.\
    \  Numerically controlled machines, either controlled from a user\n       terminal\
    \ or code prepared by a HOST computer to be punched on the\n       paper tape\
    \ punch at a teletype way require the use of an arbitrary\n       8 bit code.\n\
    \   3.  Experiments controlled from alphanumeric terminal or sensor data\n   \
    \    collected through a cal-comp like connection may require the use\n      \
    \ of a full 8 bit code.\nIn these cases a transparent data type with a provision\
    \ for a return\nto ASCII mode seems desirable.\nAs more and more use of data base\
    \ systems in the network is\nconsidered, the need for and importance of using\
    \ access keys,\npasswords, etc. grows.  The fact that it is difficult to select\
    \ the\nlength of input to be hidden is not a persuasive argument.  Potential\n\
    solutions seem to exist, e.g. the protocol could provide for accepting\nlength\
    \ statements from the user program, data base system, operating\nsystem, etc.\
    \ and in default of this, use a default length representing\nthe server system\
    \ expected optimum length.\n       [ This RFC was put into machine readable form\
    \ for entry ]\n       [ into the online RFC archives by BBN Corp. under the  \
