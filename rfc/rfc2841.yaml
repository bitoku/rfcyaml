- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   The Authentication Header (AH) [RFC-1826] provides integrity\
    \ and\n   authentication for IP datagrams.  This specification describes the AH\n\
    \   use of keys with the Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA1) [FIPS-180-1].  This\n  \
    \ SHA1-IP-MAC algorithm uses a leading and trailing key (a variant of\n   the\
    \ \"envelope method\"), with alignment padding between both keys and\n   data.\n\
    \      It should be noted that this document specifies a newer version of\n  \
    \    SHA than that described in [FIPS-180], which was flawed.  The\n      older\
    \ version is not interoperable with the newer version.\n   This document assumes\
    \ that the reader is familiar with the related\n   document \"Security Architecture\
    \ for the Internet Protocol\" [RFC-\n   1825], that defines the overall security\
    \ plan for IP, and provides\n   important background for this specification.\n"
- title: 1.1.  Keys
  contents:
  - "1.1.  Keys\n   The secret authentication key shared between the communicating\n\
    \   parties SHOULD be a cryptographically strong random number, not a\n   guessable\
    \ string of any sort.\n   The shared key is not constrained by this transform\
    \ to any particular\n   size.  Lengths of 160-bits (20 octets) MUST be supported\
    \ by the\n   implementation, although any particular key may be shorter.  Longer\n\
    \   keys are encouraged.\n"
- title: 1.2.  Data Size
  contents:
  - "1.2.  Data Size\n   SHA1's 160-bit output is naturally 32-bit aligned.  However,\
    \ many\n   implementations require 64-bit alignment of the following headers.\n\
    \   Therefore, several options are available for data alignment (most\n   preferred\
    \ to least preferred):\n   1) only the most significant 128-bits (16 octets) of\
    \ output are used.\n   2) an additional 32-bits (4 octets) of padding is added\
    \ before the\n      SHA1 output.\n   3) an additional 32-bits (4 octets) of padding\
    \ is added after the\n      SHA1 output.\n   4) the SHA1 output is variably bit-positioned\
    \ within 192-bits (24\n      octets).\n   The size and position of the output\
    \ are negotiated as part of the key\n   management.  Padding bits are filled with\
    \ unspecified implementation\n   dependent (random) values, which are ignored\
    \ on receipt.\n   Discussion:\n      Although truncation of the output for alignment\
    \ purposes may\n      appear to reduce the effectiveness of the algorithm, some\
    \ analysts\n      of attack verification suggest that this may instead improve\
    \ the\n      overall robustness [PO95a].\n"
- title: 1.3.  Performance
  contents:
  - "1.3.  Performance\n   Preliminary results indicate that SHA1 is 62% as fast as\
    \ MD5, and 80%\n   as fast as DES hashing.  That is:\n                       \
    \    SHA1 < DES < MD5\n   This appears to be a reasonable performance tradeoff,\
    \ as SHA1\n   internal chaining is significantly longer than either DES or MD5:\n\
    \                           DES < MD5 < SHA1\n   Nota Bene:\n      Suggestions\
    \ are sought on alternative authentication algorithms\n      that have significantly\
    \ faster throughput, are not patent-\n      encumbered, and still retain adequate\
    \ cryptographic strength.\n"
- title: 2.  Calculation
  contents:
  - "2.  Calculation\n   The 160-bit digest is calculated as described in [FIPS-180-1].\
    \  A\n   portable C language implementation of SHA1 is available via FTP from\n\
    \   ftp://rand.org/pub/jim/sha.tar.gz.\n   The form of the authenticated message\
    \ is:\n      SHA1( key, keyfill, datagram, datafill, key, sha1fill )\n   First,\
    \ the variable length secret authentication key is filled to the\n   next 512-bit\
    \ boundary, using the same pad-with-length technique\n   defined for SHA1.  The\
    \ padding technique includes a length that\n   protects arbitrary length keys.\n\
    \   Next, the filled key is concatenated with (immediately followed by)\n   the\
    \ invariant fields of the entire IP datagram (variant fields are\n   zeroed).\
    \  This is also filled to the next 512-bit boundary, using the\n   same pad-with-length\
    \ technique defined for SHA1.  The length includes\n   the leading key and data.\n\
    \   Then, the filled data is concatenated with (immediately followed by)\n   the\
    \ original variable length key again.  A trailing pad-with-length\n   to the next\
    \ 512-bit boundary for the entire message is added by SHA1\n   itself.\n   Finally,\
    \ the 160-bit SHA1 digest is calculated, and the result is\n   inserted into the\
    \ Authentication Data field.\n   Discussion:\n      The leading copy of the key\
    \ is padded in order to facilitate\n      copying of the key at machine boundaries\
    \ without requiring re-\n      alignment of the following datagram.  Filling to\
    \ the SHA1 block\n      size also allows the key to be prehashed to avoid the\
    \ physical\n      copy in some implementations.\n      The trailing copy of the\
    \ key is not necessary to protect against\n      appending attacks, as the IP\
    \ datagram already includes a total\n      length field.  It reintroduces mixing\
    \ of the entire key, providing\n      protection for very long and very short\
    \ datagrams, and robustness\n      against possible attacks on the IP length field\
    \ itself.\n      When the implementation adds the keys and padding in place before\n\
    \      and after the IP datagram, care must be taken that the keys and/or\n  \
    \    padding are not sent over the link by the link driver.\n"

- title: Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "Security Considerations\n   Users need to understand that the quality of the\
    \ security provided by\n   this specification depends completely on the strength\
    \ of the SHA1\n   hash function, the correctness of that algorithm's implementation,\n\
    \   the security of the key management mechanism and its implementation,\n   the\
    \ strength of the key, and upon the correctness of the\n   implementations in\
    \ all of the participating nodes.\n   The SHA algorithm was originally derived\
    \ from the MD4 algorithm\n   [RFC-1320].  A flaw was apparently found in the original\n\
    \   specification of SHA [FIPS-180], and this document specifies the use\n   of\
    \ a corrected version [FIPS-180-1].\n   At the time of writing of this document,\
    \ there are no known flaws in\n   the SHA1 algorithm.  That is, there are no known\
    \ attacks on SHA1 or\n   any of its components that are better than brute force,\
    \ and the 160-\n   bit hash size of SHA1 is substantially more resistant to brute\
    \ force\n   attacks than the 128-bit hash size of MD4 and MD5.\n   However, as\
    \ the flaw in the original SHA1 algorithm shows,\n   cryptographers are fallible,\
    \ and there may be substantial\n   deficiencies yet to be discovered in the algorithm.\n"
