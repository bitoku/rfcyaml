  - "Abstract\n   This document contains a set of basic recommendations for a country-\n\
    \   level X.500 DSA.  These recommendations can only be considered a\n   starting\
    \ point in the quest to create a global production quality\n   X.500 infrastructure.\
    \  For there to be a true \"production quality\"\n   X.500 infrastructure more\
    \ work must be done, including a transition\n   from the 1988 X.500 (plus some\
    \ Internet extensions) to the 1993 X.500\n   standard (including the '93 replication\
    \ and knowledge model).  This\n   document does not discuss this transition.\n"
- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   The ISO/CCITT X.500 Directory standard enables the creation\
    \ of a\n   single world-wide Directory that contains information about various\n\
    \   types of information, including people. In the United States, in mid\n   1989\
    \ NYSERNet (the project was later taken over by Performance\n   Systems International\
    \ - PSI) started a White-pages Pilot Project\n   (WPP).  Several organizations\
    \ in the US joined this project.  The PSI\n   WPP provided the c=US root level\
    \ master Directory System Agent (DSA)\n   where organizations that joined the\
    \ pilot were connected.  In\n   November 1990, the PARADISE project was started\
    \ in Europe to provide\n   an international directory service across Europe with\
    \ international\n   connectivity to the rest of the world.  The PARADISE project\
    \ also\n   operated the \"root of the world\" DSA that connected each of the\n\
    \   national pilots into a single world-wide Directory Information Tree\n   (DIT),\
    \ enabling information about people all over the world to be\n   obtainable using\
    \ an Internet DUA (Directory User Agent).\n   Much of the criticism of X.500 stems\
    \ from the lack of a production\n   quality infrastructure.  Although there are\
    \ already well over 500\n   organizations and 1,000,000 entries in the the X.500\
    \ directory, some\n   portions of the directory are still considered a \"pilot\
    \ project\".\n   Poor availability of portions of the directory and inconsistent\n\
    \   quality of information are two problems that have not been adequately\n  \
    \ addressed in a number of the X.500 \"pilot projects\".  One of the\n   reasons\
    \ for this has been a lack of formal service objectives for\n   running an X.500\
    \ service, and recommendations for achieving them.\n   In X.500, the country-level\
    \ DSAs form the access path for the rest of\n   the world to access directory\
    \ entries associated with that country's\n   organizations.  Thus, the availability\
    \ and performance of the\n   country-level DSAs give an upper bound to the quality\
    \ of service of\n   the whole country's part of the Directory.\n"
- title: 2. Recommendations for the country-level Master DSA
  contents:
  - "2. Recommendations for the country-level Master DSA\n   We will split the recommendations\
    \ into three categories:  Operational\n   recommendations for the organization\
    \ running the master DSA (service\n   provider), DSA recommendations and personnel\
    \ recommendations.\n"
- title: 2a. Operational recommendations for the country-level master and shadow
  contents:
  - "2a. Operational recommendations for the country-level master and shadow\n   \
    \ DSAs\n   In general, the country-level data should be available for querying\n\
    \   100% of the time.  Availability for updating is also important, but\n   may\
    \ be slightly reduced in practice, given X.500's single master\n   scheme.\n \
    \  *  The master DSA should be available at least 95% of the time.  This\n   means\
    \ that the DSA must be monitored and supported over the weekend.\n   * The Master\
    \ DSA and its shadows should be positioned to minimize the\n   possibility of\
    \ single points of failure.\n   * The master and its shadow DSAs should be disbursed\
    \ across the\n   national network infrastructure in order to distribute the load\n\
    \   across the network, and to get the information closer to the\n   requesters.\
    \  This distribution should also minimize the possibility\n   of a single point\
    \ of failure, increasing availability.\n   * Country DIT information, including\
    \ naming infrastructure\n   information such as localities and states, should\
    \ be replicated\n   across the oceans - not only to serve when the trans-oceanic\
    \ links go\n   down, but also to handle name resolution operations for clients\
    \ in\n   other countries.  There should be a complete copy of the US root in\n\
    \   Europe and a copy of the Japanese root in Africa and North America,\n   for\
    \ instance.  Generally, data should be replicated where ever it is\n   heavily\
    \ used, and where it will be needed in the event of a network\n   partition.\n\
    \   *  The master and shadow DSAs must run software that conforms to all\n   the\
    \ recommendations listed in section 4.\n"
- title: 2b. Operational recommendations for the service provider
  contents:
  - "2b. Operational recommendations for the service provider\n   * Provide a generic\
    \ e-mail address for the DSA manager (e.g., x500-\n   manager@foo.com).  More\
    \ than one manager should be available to\n   handle problems as they come up\
    \ (i.e., the manager should be able to\n   go on vacation!).\n   *  E-mail to\
    \ the manager of the master DSA must be answered in a\n   timely fashion:\n  \
    \    * All mail to the manager should be acknowledged as received\n      within\
    \ one working day.\n      * Trouble reports concerning the master and shadow DSAs\
    \ must be\n      answered within 24 hours;  this response should include a\n \
    \     resolution to the problem (when possible).  There are situations\n     \
    \ where problem resolution may take longer than 24 hours, but this\n      should\
    \ be unusual.\n      * General informational requests (e.g., how to join the service,\n\
    \      where to get the software, etc.) should be acknowledged within 2\n    \
    \  working days and should normally be resolved within 2 working\n      days.\n\
    \   *  Maintain a current e-mail distribution list of all DSA managers\n   within\
    \ the country.  Changes to this list must be made in a timely\n   manner (within\
    \ 2 working days).  It may be useful to include X.500\n   software vendors and\
    \ funders on this distribution list.\n   *  Provide quick turn around (2 working\
    \ days) for changes/additions\n   to the national master DSA (i.e., requests to\
    \ add a new organization,\n   to change a DSA's information, or to remove a DSA).\
    \  Acknowledgments\n   to these requests must be made within 1 working day.\n\
    \   *  At a minimum, the manager will make available documentation about\n   the\
    \ X.500 Production Service that includes information about how to\n   join, which\
    \ software to run and where to obtain it, naming\n   guidelines, schema requirements,\
    \ operational requirements, etc.\n   Ideally, the manager  should take a proactive\
    \ role in advertising the\n   X.500 Production Service and soliciting new members.\n\
    \   *  If the service is currently operating at a \"pilot\" level, remove\n  \
    \ references to \"pilot\" from the service and establish a process with\n   the\
    \ national-level DSA managers to transition from a pilot to a\n   production service.\
    \  This transition plan must include the production\n   of a new set of requirements\
    \ for their DSAs in the new production\n   service (see section 3).\n   *  Remove\
    \ organizations and their DSAs that do not meet the service's\n   published operational\
    \ guidelines (see section 3).  DSA managers\n   should be notified at least 4\
    \ weeks in advance of removal to give\n   them time to correct their operational\
    \ deficiencies. This procedure\n   should be performed at least once every 3 months.\
    \  A grace period of\n   3 months should be given to new organizations to come\
    \ up to speed.\n   * The service provider should work with other national X.500\
    \ service\n   providers in the same country to ensure a single consistent DIT\n\
    \   within the country.  In North America, for example, the Production\n   X.500\
    \ service should act as an ADDMD in the North American Directory\n   Forum (NADF)\
    \ X.500 service, producing timely Knowledge and Naming\n   (KAN) updates for the\
    \ Central Administration for the NADF (CAN) when\n   entries under c=US or c=CA\
    \ are added, changed or removed, and\n   applying KAN updates produced by the\
    \ CAN in response to updates from\n   other ADDMDs.\n   This will ensure a single\
    \ consistent DIT common to both NADF and\n   Internet X.500.\n"

  - "2c. Personnel recommendations for the country-level Master DSA\n   * Participate\
    \ in various technical forums, where appropriate.  This\n   requirement will become\
    \ more important as more technical work\n   transpires (e.g., for the 93 transition).\n\
    \   * Provide a help desk that DSA managers can go to for help resolving\n   operational\
    \ problems.  Support should be provided via e-mail and\n   optionally via telephone.\
    \  This help desk facility is intended to\n   provide support above and beyond\
    \ that provided on the mailing list\n   mentioned previously.\n   * Publish quarterly\
    \ status reports giving details on the state of the\n   service: new organizations,\
    \ deleted organizations, statistics on the\n   availability of the master and\
    \ shadow DSAs, number of operations\n   performed by the master and shadow DSAs,\
    \ etc.\n   * Provide electronic access to service information.  Some useful ways\n\
    \   of doing this are:\n      Provide a World Wide Web (WWW) page that includes\
    \ information\n      describing the service, together with contact information,\n\
    \      pointers to useful software, a form that can be used to submit\n      comments/bug\
    \ reports, and any other useful information that can be\n      provided.\n   \
    \   Provide FTP access to above information.\n"

    \ Domain (DMD)\n   The following are recommendations for all DSAs that are operating\n\
    \   within the country-level DMD.\n      * The availability of the organization's\
    \ subtree should be as\n      close to 100% as possible.  This coverage shall\
    \ be provided by a\n      master DSA and zero or more shadow DSAs.\n      * Organizations\
    \ should maintain information in their DSAs that is\n      complete, accurate,\
    \ and up-to-date.  This information shall be\n      accessible through Directory\
    \ protocols to the extent allowable by\n      the security and privacy policies\
    \ of the respective organizations.\n      * Organizations experimenting with the\
    \ Directory should either be\n      marked clearly as \"experimental\" (e.g.,\
    \ with an appropriate\n      Quality of Service attribute, or perhaps by including\
    \ the word\n      \"experimental\" as part of the organization's RDN), or they\
    \ should\n      be listed in a separate portion of the namespace, also clearly\n\
    \      marked.  Once the organization is done experimenting, it can be\n     \
    \ move to the \"production\" part of the DIT.\n      * Two contact persons must\
    \ be named as DSA managers for each DSA\n      * DSA software should conform to\
    \ the recommendations found in\n      section 4.\n"
