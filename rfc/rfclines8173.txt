Abstract This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB) for use with network management protocols in internets based on TCP or IP.
In particular, it defines objects for managing networks using the Precision Time Protocol (PTP), specified in IEEE Std.
This memo specifies a MIB module in a manner that is both compliant to the Structure of Management Information version 2
(SMIv2) and semantically identical to the peer SMIv1 definitions.
This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB) module for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
In particular, it describes managed objects used for managing PTP devices including ordinary clocks, transparent clocks, and boundary clocks.
This MIB module is restricted to reading standard PTP data elements, as described in [IEEE 1588 2008].
This enables it to monitor the operation of PTP clocks within the network.
It is envisioned that this MIB module will complement other managed objects to be defined that will provide more detailed information on the performance of PTP clocks supporting the Telecom Profile defined in [G.8265.1] and any future profiles that may be defined.
Those objects are considered out of scope for the current document.
Similarly, this MIB module is read only and not intended to provide the ability to configure PTP clocks.
Since PTP clocks are often embedded in other network elements such as routers, switches, and gateways, this ability is generally provided via the configuration interface for the network element.
The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14
when, and only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here.
Relationship to Other Profiles and MIBs
This MIB module is intended to be used with the default PTP profile described in [IEEE 1588 2008]
when running over the IP network layer.
As stated above, it is envisioned that this MIB module will complement other managed objects to be defined to monitor and measure the performance of PTP clocks supporting specific PTP profiles, e.g., the Telecom Profile defined in [G.8265.1].
Some other PTP profiles have their own MIB modules defined as part of the profile, and this MIB module is not intended to replace those MIB modules.
The Internet Standard Management Framework
For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current Internet Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of RFC 3410 [RFC3410].
Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed the Management Information Base or MIB.
MIB objects are generally accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the Structure of Management Information (SMI).
This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58, RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58
, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
The objects defined in this MIB module are to be used when describing the Precision Time Protocol (PTP), as defined in [IEEE 1588 2008].
Section 6 of [IEEE 1588 2008] provides an overview of synchronization networks using PTP.
Terms used in this document have meanings as defined in Section 3.1 of [IEEE 1588 2008].

Overview of PTP version 2
[IEEE 1588 2008] defines a protocol enabling precise synchronization of clocks in measurement and control systems implemented with packet based networks, the Precision Time Protocol version 2 (PTPv2).
This MIB module does not address PTPv1,
the earlier version defined in IEEE Std. 1588 2002.
The protocol is applicable to network elements communicating using IP.
The protocol enables heterogeneous systems that include clocks of various inherent precision, resolution, and stability to synchronize to a grandmaster clock.
The protocol supports system wide synchronization accuracy in the sub microsecond range with minimal network and local clock computing resources.
[IEEE 1588 2008] uses UDP/IP or Ethernet and can be adapted to other mappings.
It includes formal mechanisms for message extensions, higher sampling rates, correction for asymmetry, a clock type to reduce error accumulation in large topologies, and specifications on how to incorporate the resulting additional data into the synchronization protocol.
[IEEE 1588 2008] also defines conformance and management capability.
This MIB module supports the Precision Time Protocol version 2
(PTPv2, hereafter designated as PTP) features of network element system devices, when using the default PTP profile described in [IEEE 1588 2008]
when running over the IP network layer.
It is envisioned that this MIB module will complement other managed objects to be defined to monitor and measure the performance of the PTP devices and telecom clocks supporting specific PTP profiles.
Some other PTP profiles have their own MIB modules defined as part of the profile, and this MIB module is not intended to replace those MIB modules.
Technical terms used in this module are defined in [IEEE 1588 2008].
The MIB module refers to sections of [IEEE 1588 2008].

There are no management objects defined in this MIB module that have a MAX ACCESS clause of read write and/or read create.
So, if this MIB module is implemented correctly, then there is no risk that an intruder can alter or create any management objects of this MIB module via direct SNMP SET operations.
Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a MAX ACCESS other than not accessible) may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.
It is thus important to control
even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over the network via SNMP.
These are the tables and objects and their sensitivity/vulnerability: ptpDomainClockPortsTotal, ptpbaseSystemDomainTotals, and ptpbaseSystemProfile expose general information about the clock system.
ptpbaseClockRunningState, ptpbaseClockRunningPacketsSent, and ptpbaseClockRunningPacketsReceived expose a clock's current running status.
ptpbaseClockCurrentDSMeanPathDelay expose the values of a clock's current dataset (currentDS).

ptpbaseClockTransDefaultDSClockIdentity, ptpbaseClockTransDefaultDSNumOfPorts, ptpbaseClockTransDefaultDSDelay, and ptpbaseClockTransDefaultDSPrimaryDomain expose the values of a transparent clock's default dataset (transparentClockDefaultDS).
ptpbaseClockPortName, ptpbaseClockPortRole, ptpbaseClockPortSyncTwoStep, ptpbaseClockPortCurrentPeerAddressType, ptpbaseClockPortCurrentPeerAddress, and ptpbaseClockPortNumOfAssociatedPorts
expose general information about a clock port.
ptpbaseClockPortRunningRole, ptpbaseClockPortRunningInterfaceIndex, ptpbaseClockPortRunningTransport, ptpbaseClockPortRunningEncapsulationType, ptpbaseClockPortRunningTxMode, ptpbaseClockPortRunningRxMode, ptpbaseClockPortRunningPacketsReceived, and ptpbaseClockPortRunningPacketsSent expose a clock port's current running status.

ptpbaseClockPortAssociateAddressType, ptpbaseClockPortAssociateAddress, ptpbaseClockPortAssociatePacketsSent, ptpbaseClockPortAssociatePacketsReceived, ptpbaseClockPortAssociateInErrors, and ptpbaseClockPortAssociateOutErrors expose information about a clock port's peer node.
SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
Even if the network itself is secure (for example, by using IPsec), even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is allowed to access and GET (read)
the objects in this MIB module.
Implementations SHOULD provide the security features described by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410]), and implementations claiming compliance to the SNMPv3 standard MUST include full support for authentication and privacy via the User based Security Model (USM)
[RFC3414] with the AES cipher algorithm [RFC3826].
Implementations MAY also provide support for the Transport Security Model (TSM)
[RFC5591] in combination with a secure transport such as SSH [RFC5592] or TLS/DTLS [RFC6353].
Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT recommended.
Instead, it is recommended to deploy SNMPv3 and to enable cryptographic security.
It is then a customer/operator responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to those objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate rights to access them.
