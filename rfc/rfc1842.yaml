  - "1. Introduction\n   Chinese (and other east Asia languages) characters are encoded\
    \ with\n   multiple bytes to guarantee sufficient coding space for the large\n\
    \   number of glyphs these languages contain. With the prolification of\n   internetwork\
    \ traffic around the world, it becomes necessary to define\n   ways to facilitate\
    \ the transfer of text in multiple-byte character-\n   set languages (hereafter\
    \ as Chinese text) over internet.\n   There are two layers of concerns need to\
    \ be addressed by any\n   mechanism whose purpose is to transfer Chinese text\
    \ over internet.\n   The first is on application layer, in which concerned applications\n\
    \   should be able to recognize the encoding of the text and/or discern\n   different\
    \ character sets which might be mixed in the text and handle\n   it accordingly.\
    \ The second layer is the actual transport of Chinese\n   text between point A\
    \ to point B over the Internet. Because the\n   prevailing mail transport protocol\
    \ used over internet, the Simple\n   Mail Transport Protocol (aka. SMTP) was designed\
    \ originally for ASCII\n   character set only, many internet mail agents are not\
    \ 8 bit clean and\n   therefore introduce challenges for any attempt to actually\
    \ implement\n   a mechanism for the transport of Chinese text over internet.\n\
    \   Here we describe a mechanism for transmission of Chinese text over IP\n  \
    \ network. This described mechanism has being implemented by various\n   software\
    \ package dealing with multi-language support and has been\n   tested on USENET\
    \ newsgroups and other types of internet forums over\n   the last two years. The\
    \ test results shows that the HZ representation\n   can pass through almost all\
    \ existing mail delivery agents without\n   being corrupted. The HZ representation\
    \ currently handles GB2312-80\n   Chinese character set only. Further expansion\
    \ to other Chinese\n   encoding systems and to other East Asia Language is under\n\
    \   consideration.\n"
- title: 2. Description
  contents:
  - "2. Description\n   For an arbitrary mixed text with both Chinese coded text strings\
    \ and\n   ASCII text strings, we designate to two distinguishable text modes,\n\
    \   ASCII mode and HZ mode, as the only two states allowed in the text.\n   At\
    \ any given time, the text is in either one of these two modes or in\n   the transition\
    \ from one to the other. In the HZ mode, only printable\n   ASCII characters (0x21-0x7E)\
    \ are meanful with the size of basic text\n   unit being two bytes long.\n   In\
    \ the ASCII mode, the size of basic text unit is one (1) byte with\n   the exception\
    \ '~~', which is the special sequence representing the\n   ASCII character '~'.\
    \ In both ASCII mode and HZ mode, '~' leads an\n   escape sequence. However, as\
    \ HZ mode has basic size of text unit\n   being 2 bytes long, only the '~' character\
    \ which appears at the first\n   byte of the the two-byte character frame are\
    \ considered as the start\n   of an escape sequence.\n   The default mode is ASCII\
    \ mode. Each line of text starts with the\n   default ASCII mode. Therefore, all\
    \ Chinese character strings are to\n   be enclosed with '~{' and '~}' pair in\
    \ the same text line.\n   The escape sequences defined are as the following:\n\
    \        ~{       ---- escape from ASCII mode to GB2312 HZ mode\n        ~}  \
    \     ---- escape from HZ mode to ASCII mode\n        ~~       ---- ASCII character\
    \ '~' in ASCII mode\n        ~\\n      ---- line continuation in ASCII mode\n\
    \        ~[!-z|]  ---- reserved for future HZ mode character sets\n   A few examples\
    \ of the 7 bit representation of Chinese GB coded test\n   taken directly from\
    \ [Lee89] are listed as the following:\n   Example 1:  (Suppose there is no line\
    \ size limit.)\n               This sentence is in ASCII.\n               The\
    \ next sentence is in GB.~{<:Ky2;S{#,NpJ)l6HK!#~}Bye.\n   Example 2:  (Suppose\
    \ the maximum line size is 42.)\n               This sentence is in ASCII.\n \
    \              The next sentence is in GB.~{<:Ky2;S{#,~}~\n               ~{NpJ)l6HK!#~}Bye.\n\
    \   Example 3:  (Suppose a new line is started for every mode switch.)\n     \
    \          This sentence is in ASCII.\n               The next sentence is in\
    \ GB.~\n               ~{<:Ky2;S{#,NpJ)l6HK!#~}~\n               Bye.\n"

- title: 5. Background Information
  contents:
  - "5. Background Information\n   A GB code is a two byte character withe the first\
    \ byte is in the\n   range of 0x21-0x77 and the second byte in the range 0x21-0x7E.\
    \ As the\n   printable ASCII subset of characters are single byte character in\
    \ the\n   range of 0x21--0x7E, two printable ASCII characters can represent a\n\
    \   two byte GB coded Chinese character if proper escape sequence is used\n  \
    \ to indicate the proper text mode. This form the base of the above\n   described\
    \ HZ 7-bit representation methods. Further, with the use of a\n   printable ASCII\
    \ character, '~', as the leading byte of the escape\n   sequence, the HZ representation\
    \ eliminated the need of reserving any\n   non-printable ASCII characters, which\
    \ are commonly used by\n   application programs (as well as system environment)\
    \ for various\n   control function or other special signaling. Therefore, the\
    \ HZ\n   representation method described here posses the least probability of\n\
    \   interfering with the host and network environment.  This is also a\n   convenient\
    \ for application for implementing the HZ coding method.\n   HZ representation\
    \ method has been implemented in various Chinese\n   software across computer\
    \ hardware platforms. It has also being tested\n   for more than two years over\
    \ USENET newsgroups, alt.chinese.text and\n   chinese.*, for the transmission\
    \ of Chinese texts over the internet.\n   The original points of those transferred\
    \ Chinese texts are\n   geographically scattered around the world and under the\
    \ constraints\n   of vast different system and network environments.  Therefore,\
    \ such a\n   test group may well represent a rather complete sample of the real\n\
    \   internet world. The successful test of the HZ representation method\n   therefore\
    \ builds up the confidence that it is well suited for\n   transmitting multi-byte\
    \ text messages over the internet.\n   Under HZ representation, ASCII text remain\
    \ as 7-bit characters and\n   therefore HZ representation together with the 7-bit\
    \ ASCII character\n   set can be viewed as forming a superset of characters.\n"
