- title: 2.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "2.  Introduction\n   The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) [2] is an application-layer\n\
    \   control protocol that can establish, modify and terminate multimedia\n   sessions\
    \ or calls.  A SIP system has a number of logical components:\n   user agents,\
    \ proxy servers, redirect servers and registrars.  User\n   agents MAY contain\
    \ SIP clients, proxy servers always do.\n   This document specifies a DHCP option\
    \ [1,5] that allows SIP clients\n   to locate a local SIP server that is to be\
    \ used for all outbound SIP\n   requests, a so-called outbound proxy server. \
    \ (SIP clients MAY\n   contact the address identified in the SIP URL directly,\
    \ without\n   involving a local SIP server.  However in some circumstances, for\n\
    \   example, when firewalls are present, SIP clients need to use a local\n   server\
    \ for outbound requests.)  This is one of many possible\n   solutions for locating\
    \ the outbound SIP server; manual configuration\n   is an example of another.\n"
- title: 3.  SIP Server DHCP Option
  contents:
  - "3.  SIP Server DHCP Option\n   The SIP server DHCP option carries either a 32-bit\
    \ (binary) IPv4\n   address or, preferably, a DNS (RFC 1035 [6]) fully-qualified\
    \ domain\n   name to be used by the SIP client to locate a SIP server.\n   The\
    \ option has two encodings, specified by the encoding byte ('enc')\n   that follows\
    \ the code byte.  If the encoding byte has the value 0, it\n   is followed by\
    \ a list of domain names, as described below (Section\n   3.1).  If the encoding\
    \ byte has the value 1, it is followed by one or\n   more IPv4 addresses (Section\
    \ 3.2).  All implementations MUST support\n   both encodings.  The 'Len' field\
    \ indicates the total number of octets\n   in the option following the 'Len' field,\
    \ including the encoding byte.\n   A DHCP server MUST NOT mix the two encodings\
    \ in the same DHCP\n   message, even if it sends two different instances of the\
    \ same option.\n   Attempts to do so would result in incorrect client behavior\
    \ as DHCP\n   processing rules call for the concatenation of multiple instances\
    \ of\n   an option into a single option prior to processing the option [7].\n\
    \   The code for this option is 120.\n"
- title: 3.1 Domain Name List
  contents:
  - "3.1 Domain Name List\n   If the 'enc' byte has a value of 0, the encoding byte\
    \ is followed by\n   a sequence of labels, encoded according to Section 3.1 of\
    \ RFC 1035\n   [6], quoted below:\n         Domain names in messages are expressed\
    \ in terms of a sequence\n         of labels.  Each label is represented as a\
    \ one octet length\n         field followed by that number of octets.  Since every\
    \ domain\n         name ends with the null label of the root, a domain name is\n\
    \         terminated by a length byte of zero.  The high order two bits\n    \
    \     of every length octet must be zero, and the remaining six bits\n       \
    \  of the length field limit the label to 63 octets or less.  To\n         simplify\
    \ implementations, the total length of a domain name\n         (i.e., label octets\
    \ and label length octets) is restricted to\n         255 octets or less.\n  \
    \ RFC 1035 encoding was chosen to accommodate future internationalized\n   domain\
    \ name mechanisms.\n   The minimum length for this encoding is 3.\n   The option\
    \ MAY contain multiple domain names, but these SHOULD refer\n   to different NAPTR\
    \ records, rather than different A records.  The\n   client MUST try the records\
    \ in the order listed, applying the\n   mechanism described in Section 4.1 of\
    \ RFC 3263 [3] for each.  The\n   client only resolves the subsequent domain names\
    \ if attempts to\n   contact the first one failed or yielded no common transport\
    \ protocols\n   between client and server or denote a domain administratively\n\
    \   prohibited by client policy.\n         Use of multiple domain names is not\
    \ meant to replace NAPTR and\n         SRV records, but rather to allow a single\
    \ DHCP server to\n         indicate outbound proxy servers operated by multiple\
    \ providers.\n   Clients MUST support compression according to the encoding in\
    \ Section\n   4.1.4 of \"Domain Names - Implementation And Specification\" [6].\n\
    \         Since the domain names are supposed to be different domains,\n     \
    \    compression will likely have little effect, however.\n   If the length of\
    \ the domain list exceeds the maximum permissible\n   within a single option (254\
    \ octets), then the domain list MUST be\n   represented in the DHCP message as\
    \ specified in [7].\n   The DHCP option for this encoding has the following format:\n\
    \        Code  Len   enc   DNS name of SIP server\n      +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+--\n\
    \      | 120 |  n  |  0  |  s1 |  s2 |  s3 |  s4 | s5  |  ...\n      +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+--\n\
    \   As an example, consider the case where the server wants to offer two\n   outbound\
    \ proxy servers, \"example.com\" and \"example.net\".  These would\n   be encoded\
    \ as follows:\n      +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+\n\
    \      |120|27 | 0 | 7 |'e'|'x'|'a'|'m'|'p'|'l'|'e'| 3 |'c'|'o'|'m'| 0 |\n   \
    \   +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+\n      +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+\
    \ | 7\n      |'e'|'x'|'a'|'m'|'p'|'l'|'e'| 3 |'n'|'e'|'t'| 0 | +---+---+---\n\
    \      +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+\n"
- title: 3.2  IPv4 Address List
  contents:
  - "3.2  IPv4 Address List\n   If the 'enc' byte has a value of 1, the encoding byte\
    \ is followed by\n   a list of IPv4 addresses indicating SIP outbound proxy servers\n\
    \   available to the client.  Servers MUST be listed in order of\n   preference.\n\
    \   Its minimum length is 5, and the length MUST be a multiple of 4 plus\n   one.\
    \  The DHCP option for this encoding has the following format:\n       Code  \
    \ Len   enc   Address 1               Address 2\n      +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+--\n\

  contents:
  - "4.  Security Considerations\n   The security considerations in RFC 2131 [1],\
    \ RFC 2543 [2] and RFC\n   3263 [3] apply.  If an adversary manages to modify\
    \ the response from\n   a DHCP server or insert its own response, a SIP user agent\
    \ could be\n   led to contact a rogue SIP server, possibly one that then intercepts\n\
    \   call requests or denies service.  A modified DHCP answer could also\n   omit\
    \ host names that translated to TLS-based SIP servers, thus\n   facilitating intercept.\n"
