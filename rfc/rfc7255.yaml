  - "1.  Introduction\n   This specification defines how the Uniform Resource Name\
    \ (URN)\n   reserved for the Global System for Mobile Communications Association\n\
    \   (GSMA) identities and its sub-namespace for the International Mobile\n   station\
    \ Equipment Identity (IMEI) as specified in RFC 7254 [1] can be\n   used as an\
    \ instance-id as specified in RFC 5626 [2] and also as used\n   by RFC 5627 [3].\n\
    \   RFC 5626 [2] specifies the '+sip.instance' Contact header field\n   parameter\
    \ that contains a URN as specified in RFC 2141 [4].  The\n   instance-id uniquely\
    \ identifies a specific User Agent (UA) instance.\n   This instance-id is used\
    \ as specified in RFC 5626 [2] so that the\n   Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)\
    \ registrar (as specified in RFC 3261\n   [9]) can recognize that the contacts\
    \ from multiple registrations\n   correspond to the same UA.  The instance-id\
    \ is also used as specified\n   by RFC 5627 [3] to create Globally Routable User\
    \ Agent URIs (GRUUs)\n   that can be used to uniquely address a UA when multiple\
    \ UAs are\n   registered with the same Address of Record (AoR).\n   RFC 5626 [2]\
    \ requires that a UA SHOULD create a Universally Unique\n   Identifier (UUID)\
    \ URN as specified in RFC 4122 [6] as its instance-id\n   but allows for the possibility\
    \ to use other URN schemes.  Per\n   RFC 5626, \"If a URN scheme other than UUID\
    \ is used, the UA MUST only\n   use URNs for which an RFC (from the IETF stream)\
    \ defines how the\n   specific URN needs to be constructed and used in the \"\
    +sip.instance\"\n   Contact header field parameter for outbound behavior\".  This\n\
    \   specification meets this requirement by specifying how the GSMA IMEI\n   URN\
    \ is used in the '+sip.instance' Contact header field parameter for\n   outbound\
    \ behavior, and RFC 7254 [1]  specifies how the GSMA IMEI URN\n   is constructed.\n\
    \   The GSMA IMEI is a URN for the IMEI -- a globally unique identifier\n   that\
    \ identifies mobile devices used in the GSM, Universal Mobile\n   Telecommunications\
    \ System (UMTS), and 3rd Generation Partnership\n   Project (3GPP) Long Term Evolution\
    \ (LTE) networks.  The IMEI\n   allocation is managed by the GSMA to ensure that\
    \ the IMEI values are\n   globally unique.  Details of the formatting of the IMEI\
    \ as a URN are\n   specified in RFC 7254 [1], and the definition of the IMEI is\n\
    \   contained in 3GPP TS 23.003 [10].  Further details about the GSMA's\n   role\
    \ in allocating the IMEI, and the IMEI allocation guidelines, can\n   be found\
    \ in GSMA PRD TS.06 [11].\n"

- title: 3.  Background
  contents:
  - "3.  Background\n   GSM, UMTS, and LTE capable mobile devices represent 90% of\
    \ the mobile\n   devices in use worldwide.  Every manufactured GSM, UMTS, or LTE\n\
    \   mobile device has an allocated IMEI that uniquely identifies this\n   specific\
    \ mobile device.  Among other things, in some regulatory\n   jurisdictions the\
    \ IMEI is used to identify that a stolen mobile\n   device is being used, to help\
    \ to identify the subscription that is\n   using it, and to prevent use of the\
    \ mobile device.  While GSM was\n   originally a circuit switched system, enhancements\
    \ such as the\n   General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) and UMTS have added IP data\n\
    \   capabilities that, along with the definition of the IP Multimedia\n   Subsystem\
    \ (IMS), have made SIP-based calls and IP multimedia sessions\n   from mobile\
    \ devices possible.\n   The latest enhancement, known as LTE, introduces even\
    \ higher data\n   rates and dispenses with the circuit switched infrastructure\n\
    \   completely.  This means that with LTE networks, voice calls will need\n  \
    \ to be conducted using IP and IMS.  However, the transition to all IP\n   SIP-based\
    \ IMS networks worldwide will take a great many years, and\n   mobile devices,\
    \ being mobile, will need to operate in both IP/SIP/IMS\n   mode and circuit switched\
    \ mode.  This means that calls and sessions\n   will need to be handed over between\
    \ IP/SIP/IMS mode and circuit\n   switched mode mid-call or mid-session.  Also,\
    \ since many existing GSM\n   and UMTS radio access networks are unable to support\
    \ IP/SIP/IMS-based\n   voice services in a commercially acceptable manner, some\
    \ sessions\n   could have some media types delivered via IP/IMS simultaneously\
    \ with\n   voice media delivered via the circuit switched domain to the same\n\
    \   mobile device.  To achieve this, the mobile device needs to be\n   simultaneously\
    \ attached via both the IP/SIP/IMS domain and the\n   circuit switched domain.\n\
    \   To meet this need, the 3GPP has specified how to maintain session\n   continuity\
    \ between the IP/SIP/IMS domain and the circuit switched\n   domain in 3GPP TS\
    \ 24.237 [12], and in 3GPP TS 24.292 [13] has\n   specified how to access IMS\
    \ hosted services via both the IP/SIP/IMS\n   domain and the circuit switched\
    \ domain.\n   In order for the mobile device to access SIP/IMS services via the\n\
    \   circuit switched domain, the 3GPP has specified a Mobile Switching\n   Center\
    \ (MSC) server enhanced for IMS Centralized Services (ICS) and a\n   MSC server\
    \ enhanced for Single Radio Voice Call Continuity (SR-VCC)\n   that control mobile\
    \ voice call setup over the circuit switched radio\n   access while establishing\
    \ the corresponding voice session in the core\n   network using SIP/IMS.  To enable\
    \ this, the MSC server enhanced for\n   ICS or the MSC server enhanced for SR-VCC\
    \ performs SIP registration\n   on behalf of the mobile device, which is also\
    \ simultaneously directly\n   registered with the IP/SIP/IMS domain.  The only\
    \ mobile device\n   identifier that is transportable using GSM/UMTS/LTE signaling\
    \ is the\n   IMEI; therefore, the instance-id included by the MSC server enhanced\n\
    \   for ICS or the MSC server enhanced for SR-VCC when acting on behalf\n   of\
    \ the mobile device, and the instance-id directly included by the\n   mobile device,\
    \ both need to be based on the IMEI.\n   Additionally, in order to meet the above\
    \ requirements, the same IMEI\n   that is obtained from the circuit switched signaling\
    \ by the MSC\n   server needs to be obtainable from SIP signaling so that it can\
    \ be\n   determined that both the SIP signaling and circuit switched signaling\n\
    \   originate from the same mobile device.\n   For these reasons, 3GPP TS 24.237\
    \ [12] and 3GPP TS 24.292 [13]\n   already specify the use of the URN namespace\
    \ for the GSMA IMEI URN as\n   specified in RFC 7254 [1] as the instance-id used\
    \ by GSM/UMTS/LTE\n   mobile devices, the MSC server enhanced for SR-VCC, and\
    \ the MSC\n   server enhanced for ICS, for SIP/IMS registrations and emergency-\n\
    \   related SIP requests.\n"
- title: 4.  3GPP Use Cases
  contents:
  - "4.  3GPP Use Cases\n   1.  The mobile device includes its IMEI in the SIP REGISTER\
    \ request\n       so that the SIP registrar can perform a check of the Equipment\n\
    \       Identity Register (EIR) to verify whether this mobile device is\n    \
    \   allowed to access the network for non-emergency services or is\n       barred\
    \ from doing so (e.g., because the device has been stolen).\n       If the mobile\
    \ device is not allowed to access the network for\n       non-emergency services,\
    \ the SIP registrar can reject the\n       registration and thus prevent a barred\
    \ mobile device from\n       accessing the network for non-emergency services.\n\
    \   2.  The mobile device includes its IMEI in SIP INVITE requests used\n    \
    \   to establish emergency sessions.  This is so that the Public\n       Safety\
    \ Answering Point (PSAP) can obtain the IMEI of the mobile\n       device for\
    \ identification purposes if required by regulations.\n   3.  The IMEI that is\
    \ included in SIP INVITE requests by the mobile\n       device and used to establish\
    \ emergency sessions is also used in\n       cases of unauthenticated emergency\
    \ sessions to enable the network\n       to identify the mobile device.  This\
    \ is especially important if\n       the unauthenticated emergency session is\
    \ handed over from the\n       packet switched domain to the circuit switched\
    \ domain.  In this\n       scenario, the IMEI is the only identifier that is common\
    \ to both\n       domains, so the Emergency Access Transfer Function (EATF) in\
    \ the\n       network, which in such cases coordinates the transfer between\n\
    \       domains, can use the IMEI to determine that the circuit switched\n   \
    \    call is from the same mobile device that was in the emergency\n       session\
    \ in the packet switched domain.\n"
- title: 5.  User Agent Client Procedures
  contents:
  - "5.  User Agent Client Procedures\n   A User Agent Client (UAC) that has an IMEI\
    \ as specified in 3GPP TS\n   23.003 [10] and that is registering with a 3GPP\
    \ IMS network MUST\n   include in the \"sip.instance\" media feature tag the GSMA\
    \ IMEI URN\n   according to the syntax specified in RFC 7254 [1] when performing\
    \ the\n   registration procedures specified in RFC 5626 [2] or RFC 5627 [3], or\n\
    \   any other procedure requiring the inclusion of the \"sip.instance\"\n   media\
    \ feature tag.  The UAC SHOULD NOT include the optional 'svn'\n   parameter in\
    \ the GSMA IMEI URN in the \"sip.instance\" media feature\n   tag, since the software\
    \ version can change as a result of upgrades to\n   the device firmware that would\
    \ create a new instance-id.  Any future\n   non-zero values of the 'vers' parameter,\
    \ or the future definition of\n   additional parameters for the GSMA IMEI URN\
    \ that are intended to be\n   used as part of an instance-id, will require that\
    \ an update be made\n   to this RFC.  The UAC MUST provide character-by-character\
    \ identical\n   URNs in each registration according to RFC 5626 [2].  Hence, any\n\
    \   optional or variable components of the URN (e.g., the 'vers'\n   parameter)\
    \ MUST be presented with the same values and in the same\n   order in every registration\
    \ as in the first registration.\n   A UAC MUST NOT use the GSMA IMEI URN as an\
    \ instance-id, except when\n   registering with a 3GPP IMS network.  When a UAC\
    \ is operating in IMS\n   mode, it will obtain from the Universal Integrated Circuit\
    \ Card\n   (UICC) (commonly known as the SIM card) the domain of the network\n\
    \   with which to register.  This is a carrier's IMS network domain.  The\n  \
    \ UAC will also obtain the address of the IMS edge proxy to send the\n   REGISTER\
    \ request containing the IMEI using information elements in\n   the Attach response\
    \ when it attempts to connect to the carrier's\n   packet data network.  When\
    \ registering with a non-3GPP IMS network, a\n   UAC SHOULD use a UUID as an instance-id\
    \ as specified in RFC 5626 [2].\n   A UAC MUST NOT include the \"sip.instance\"\
    \ media feature tag\n   containing the GSMA IMEI URN in the Contact header field\
    \ of non-\n   REGISTER requests, except when the request is related to an emergency\n\
    \   session.  Regulatory requirements can require that the IMEI be\n   provided\
    \ to the PSAP.  Any future exceptions to this prohibition will\n   require the\
    \ publication of an RFC that addresses how privacy is not\n   violated by such\
    \ usage.\n"

- title: 7.  3GPP SIP Registrar Procedures
  contents:
  - "7.  3GPP SIP Registrar Procedures\n   In 3GPP IMS, when the SIP registrar receives\
    \ in the Contact header\n   field a \"sip.instance\" media feature tag containing\
    \ the GSMA IMEI URN\n   according to the syntax specified in RFC 7254 [1] the\
    \ SIP registrar\n   follows the procedures specified in RFC 5626 [2].  The IMEI\
    \ URN MAY\n   be validated as described in RFC 7254 [1].  If the UA indicates\
    \ that\n   it supports the extension in RFC 5627 [3] and the SIP registrar\n \
    \  allocates a public GRUU according to the procedures specified in\n   RFC 5627\
    \ [3], the instance-id MUST be obfuscated when creating the\n   'gr' parameter\
    \ in order not to reveal the IMEI to other UAs when the\n   public GRUU is included\
    \ in non-REGISTER requests and responses.  3GPP\n   TS 24.229 [8] subclause 5.4.7A.2\
    \ specifies the mechanism for\n   obfuscating the IMEI when creating the 'gr'\
    \ parameter.\n"
- title: 8.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "8.  Security Considerations\n   Because IMEIs, like other formats of instance-ids,\
    \ can be correlated\n   to a user, they are personally identifiable information\
    \ and therefore\n   MUST be treated in the same way as any other personally identifiable\n\
    \   information.  In particular, the \"sip.instance\" media feature tag\n   containing\
    \ the GSMA IMEI URN MUST NOT be included in requests or\n   responses intended\
    \ to convey any level of anonymity, as this could\n   violate the user's privacy.\
    \  RFC 5626 [2] states that \"One case where\n   a UA could prefer to omit the\
    \ \"sip.instance\" media feature tag is\n   when it is making an anonymous request\
    \ or some other privacy concern\n   requires that the UA not reveal its identity\"\
    .  The same concerns\n   apply when using the GSMA IMEI URN as an instance-id.\
    \  Publication of\n   the GSMA IMEI URN to networks to which the UA is not attached,\
    \ or\n   with which the UA does not have a service relationship, is a security\n\
    \   breach, and the \"sip.instance\" media feature tag MUST NOT be\n   forwarded\
    \ by the service provider's network elements when forwarding\n   requests or responses\
    \ towards the destination UA.  Additionally, an\n   instance-id containing the\
    \ GSMA IMEI URN identifies a mobile device\n   and not a user.  The instance-id\
    \ containing the GSMA IMEI URN MUST\n   NOT be used alone as an address for a\
    \ user or as an identification\n   credential for a user.  The GRUU mechanism\
    \ specified in RFC 5627 [3]\n   provides a means to create URIs that address the\
    \ user at a specific\n   device or User Agent.\n   Entities that log the instance-id\
    \ need to protect them as personally\n   identifiable information.  Regulatory\
    \ requirements can require that\n   carriers log SIP IMEIs.\n   In order to protect\
    \ the \"sip.instance\" media feature tag containing\n   the GSMA IMEI URN from\
    \ being tampered with, those REGISTER requests\n   containing the GSMA IMEI URN\
    \ MUST be sent using a security mechanism\n   such as Transport Layer Security\
    \ (TLS) (RFC 5246 [5]) or another\n   security mechanism that provides equivalent\
    \ levels of protection such\n   as hop-by-hop security based upon IPsec.\n"
