- title: 1.  The SNMP Management Framework
  contents:
  - "1.  The SNMP Management Framework\n   The SNMP Management Framework presently\
    \ consists of five major\n   components:\n      o  An overall architecture, described\
    \ in [RFC 2571].\n      o  Mechanisms for describing and naming objects and events\
    \ for the\n         purpose of management.  The first version of this Structure\
    \ of\n         Management Information (SMI) is called SMIv1 and is described\n\
    \         in [RFC 1155], [RFC 1212] and [RFC 1215].  The second version,\n   \
    \      called SMIv2, is described in [RFC 2578], RFC 2579 [RFC 2579]\n       \
    \  and [RFC 2580].\n      o  Message protocols for transferring management information.\
    \  The\n         first version of the SNMP message protocol is called SNMPv1 and\n\
    \         is described in [RFC 1157].  A second version of the SNMP\n        \
    \ message protocol, which is not an Internet standards track\n         protocol,\
    \ is called SNMPv2c and is described in [RFC 1901] and\n         [RFC 1906]. \
    \ The third version of the message protocol is\n         called SNMPv3 and is\
    \ described in [RFC 1906], [RFC 2572] and\n         [RFC 2574].\n      o  Protocol\
    \ operations for accessing management information.  The\n         first set of\
    \ protocol operations and associated PDU formats is\n         described in [RFC\
    \ 1157].  A second set of protocol operations\n         and associated PDU formats\
    \ is described in [RFC 1905].\n      o  A set of fundamental applications described\
    \ in [RFC 2573] and\n         the view-based access control mechanism described\
    \ in [RFC\n         2575].\n   A more detailed introduction to the current SNMP\
    \ Management Framework\n   can be found in [RFC 2570].\n   Managed objects are\
    \ accessed via a virtual information store, termed\n   the Management Information\
    \ Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are\n   defined using the mechanisms defined\
    \ in the SMI.\n   This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2.\
    \  A\n   MIB conforming to the SMIv1 can be produced through the appropriate\n\
    \   translations.  The resulting translated MIB must be semantically\n   equivalent,\
    \ except where objects or events are omitted because there\n   is no translation\
    \ is possible (use of Counter64).  Some machine-\n   readable information in SMIv2\
    \ will be converted into textual\n   descriptions in SMIv1 during the translation\
    \ process.  However, this\n   loss of machine readable information is not considered\
    \ to change the\n   semantics of the MIB.\n   The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\"\
    , \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\"\
    , \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n   document are to be interpreted as described\
    \ in [RFC 2119].\n"

  contents:
  - "2.1.  Relationship to the Informal Management Model for Differentiated\n    \
    \  Services Router\n   This MIB is similar in design to [MODEL], although it can\
    \ be used to\n   build functional data paths that the model would not well describe.\n\
    \   The model conceptually describes ingress and egress interfaces of an\n   n-port\
    \ router, which may find some interfaces at a network edge and\n   others facing\
    \ into the network core.  It describes the configuration\n   and management of\
    \ a Differentiated Services interface in terms of one\n   or more Traffic Conditioning\
    \ Blocks (TCB), each containing, arranged\n   in the specified order, by definition,\
    \ zero or more classifiers,\n   meters, actions, algorithmic droppers, queues\
    \ and schedulers.\n   Traffic may be classified, and classified traffic may be\
    \ metered.\n   Each stream of traffic identified by a combination of classifiers\
    \ and\n   meters may have some set of actions performed on it; it may have\n \
    \  dropping algorithms applied and it may ultimately be stored into a\n   queue\
    \ before being scheduled out to its next destination, either onto\n   a link or\
    \ to another TCB.  At times, the treatment for a given packet\n   must have any\
    \ of those elements repeated.  [MODEL] models this by\n   cascading multiple TCBs,\
    \ while this MIB describes the policy by\n   directly linking the functional data\
    \ path elements.\n   The MIB represents this cascade by following the \"Next\"\
    \ attributes of\n   the various elements.  They indicate what the next step in\n\
    \   Differentiated Services processing will be, whether it be a\n   classifier,\
    \ meter, action, algorithmic dropper, queue, scheduler or a\n   decision to now\
    \ forward a packet.\n   The higher level concept of a TCB is not required in the\n\
    \   parameterization or in the linking together of the individual\n   elements,\
    \ hence it is not used in the MIB itself and is only\n   mentioned in the text\
    \ for relating the MIB with the [MODEL].  Rather,\n   the MIB models the individual\
    \ elements that make up the TCBs.\n   This MIB uses the notion of a Data Path\
    \ to indicate the\n   Differentiated Services processing a packet may experience.\
    \  The Data\n   Path a packet will initially follow is an attribute of the interface\n\
    \   in question.  The Data Path Table provides a starting point for each\n   direction\
    \ (ingress or egress) on each interface.  A Data Path Table\n   Entry indicates\
    \ the first of possible multiple elements that will\n   apply Differentiated Services\
    \ treatment to the packet.\n"
- title: 2.2.  Relationship to other MIBs and Policy Management
  contents:
  - "2.2.  Relationship to other MIBs and Policy Management\n   This MIB provides\
    \ for direct reporting and manipulation of detailed\n   functional elements. \
    \ These elements consist of a structural element\n   and one or more parameter-bearing\
    \ elements.  While this can be\n   cumbersome, it allows the reuse of parameters.\
    \  For example, a\n   service provider may offer three varieties of contracts,\
    \ and\n   configure three parameter elements.  Each such data path on the\n  \
    \ system may then refer to these sets of parameters.  The\n   diffServDataPathTable\
    \ couples each direction on each interface with\n   the specified data path linkage.\
    \  The concept of \"interface\" is as\n   defined by InterfaceIndex/ifIndex of\
    \ the IETF Interfaces MIB [IF-\n   MIB].\n   Other MIBs and data structure definitions\
    \ for policy management\n   mechanisms, other than SNMP/SMIv2 are likely to exist\
    \ in the future\n   for the purpose of abstracting the model in other ways.  An\
    \ example\n   is the Differentiated Services Policy Information Base, [DSPIB].\n\
    \   In particular, abstractions in the direction of less detailed\n   definitions\
    \ of Differentiated Services functionality are likely e.g.\n   some form of \"\
    Per-Hop Behavior\"-based definition involving a template\n   of detailed object\
    \ values which is applied to specific instances of\n   objects in this MIB semi-automatically.\n\
    \   Another possible direction of abstraction is one using a concept of\n   \"\
    roles\" (often, but not always, applied to interfaces).  In this\n   case, it\
    \ may be possible to re-use the object definitions in this\n   MIB, especially\
    \ the parameterization tables.  The Data Path table\n   will help in the reuse\
    \ of the data path linkage tables by having the\n   interface specific information\
    \ centralized, allowing easier\n   mechanical replacement of ifIndex by some sort\
    \ of \"roleIndex\".  This\n   work is ongoing.\n   The reuse of parameter blocks\
    \ on a variety of functional data paths\n   is intended to simplify network management.\
    \  In many cases, one could\n   also re-use the structural elements as well; this\
    \ has the unfortunate\n   side-effect of re-using the counters, so that monitoring\
    \ information\n   is lost.  For this reason, the re-use of structural elements\
    \ is not\n   generally recommended.\n"
- title: 3.  MIB Overview
  contents:
  - "3.  MIB Overview\n   The Differentiated Services Architecture does not specify\
    \ how an\n   implementation should be assembled.  The [MODEL] describes a general\n\
    \   approach to implementation design, or to user interface design.  Its\n   components\
    \ could, however, be assembled in a different way.  For\n   example, traffic conforming\
    \ to a meter might be run through a second\n   meter, or reclassified.\n   This\
    \ MIB models the same functional data path elements, allowing the\n   network\
    \ manager to assemble them in any fashion that meets the\n   relevant policy.\
    \  These data path elements include Classifiers,\n   Meters, Actions of various\
    \ sorts, Queues, and Schedulers.\n   In many of these tables, a distinction is\
    \ drawn between the structure\n   of the policy (do this, then do that) and the\
    \ parameters applied to\n   specific policy elements.  This is to facilitate configuration,\
    \ if\n   the MIB is used for that.  The concept is that a set of parameters,\n\
    \   such as the values that describe a specific token bucket, might be\n   configured\
    \ once and applied to many interfaces.\n   The RowPointer Textual Convention is\
    \ therefore used in two ways in\n   this MIB.  It is defined for the purpose of\
    \ connecting an object to\n   an entry dynamically; the RowPointer object identifies\
    \ the first\n   object in the target Entry, and in so doing points to the entire\n\
    \   entry.  In this MIB, it is used as a connector between successive\n   functional\
    \ data path elements, and as the link between the policy\n   structure and the\
    \ parameters that are used.  When used as a\n   connector, it says what happens\
    \ \"next\"; what happens to classified\n   traffic, to traffic conforming or not\
    \ conforming to a meter, and so\n   on.  When used to indicate the parameters\
    \ applied in a policy, it\n   says \"specifically\" what is meant; the structure\
    \ points to the\n   parameters of its policy.\n   The use of RowPointers as connectors\
    \ allows for the simple extension\n   of the MIB.  The RowPointers, whether \"\
    next\" or \"specific\", may point\n   to Entries defined in other MIB modules.\
    \  For example, the only type\n   of meter defined in this MIB is a token bucket\
    \ meter; if another type\n   of meter is required, another MIB could be defined\
    \ describing that\n   type of meter, and diffServMeterSpecific could point to\
    \ it.\n   Similarly, if a new action is required, the \"next\" pointer of the\n\
    \   previous functional datapath element could point to an Entry defined\n   in\
    \ another MIB, public or proprietary.\n"
- title: 3.1.  Processing Path
  contents:
  - "3.1.  Processing Path\n   An interface has an ingress and an egress direction,\
    \ and will\n   generally have a different policy in each direction.  As traffic\n\
    \   enters an edge interface, it may be classified, metered, counted, and\n  \
    \ marked.  Traffic leaving the same interface might be remarked\n   according\
    \ to the contract with the next network, queued to manage the\n   bandwidth, and\
    \ so on.  As [MODEL] points out, the functional datapath\n   elements used on\
    \ ingress and egress are of the same type, but may be\n   structured in very different\
    \ ways to implement the relevant policies.\n"

  - "3.1.1.  diffServDataPathTable - The Data Path Table\n   Therefore, when traffic\
    \ arrives at an ingress or egress interface,\n   the first step in applying the\
    \ policy is determining what policy\n   applies.  This MIB does that by providing\
    \ a table of pointers to the\n   first functional data path element, indexed by\
    \ interface and\n   direction on that interface.  The content of the\n   diffServDataPathEntry\
    \ is a single RowPointer, which points to that\n   functional data path element.\n\
    \   When diffServDataPathStart in a direction on an interface is\n   undefined\
    \ or is set to zeroDotZero, the implication is that there is\n   no specific policy\
    \ to apply.\n"
- title: 3.2.  Classifier
  contents:
  - "3.2.  Classifier\n   Classifiers are used to differentiate among types of traffic.\
    \  In the\n   Differentiated Services architecture, one usually discusses a\n\
    \   behavior aggregate identified by the application of one or more\n   Differentiated\
    \ Services Code Points (DSCPs).  However, especially at\n   network edges (which\
    \ include hosts and first hop routers serving\n   hosts), traffic may arrive unmarked\
    \ or the marks may not be trusted.\n   In these cases, one applies a Multi-Field\
    \ Classifier, which may\n   select an aggregate as coarse as \"all traffic\",\
    \ as fine as a specific\n   microflow identified by IP Addresses, IP Protocol,\
    \ and TCP or UDP\n   ports, or variety of slices in between.\n   Classifiers can\
    \ be simple or complex.  In a core interface, one would\n   expect to find simple\
    \ behavior aggregate classification to be used.\n   However, in an edge interface,\
    \ one might first ask what application\n   is being used, meter the arriving traffic,\
    \ and then apply various\n   policies to the non-conforming traffic depending\
    \ on the Autonomous\n   System number advertising the destination address.  To\
    \ accomplish\n   such a thing, traffic must be classified, metered, and then\n\
    \   reclassified.  To this end, the MIB defines separate classifiers,\n   which\
    \ may be applied at any point in processing, and may have\n   different content\
    \ as needed.\n   The MIB also allows for ambiguous classification in a structured\n\
    \   fashion.  In the end, traffic classification must be unambiguous; one\n  \
    \ must know for certain what policy to apply to any given packet.\n   However,\
    \ writing an unambiguous specification is often tedious, while\n   writing a specification\
    \ in steps that permits and excludes various\n   kinds of traffic may be simpler\
    \ and more intuitive.  In such a case,\n   the classification \"steps\" are enumerated;\
    \ all classification\n   elements of one precedence are applied as if in parallel,\
    \ and then\n   all classification elements of the next precedence.\n   This MIB\
    \ defines a single classifier parameter entry, the Multi-field\n   Classifier.\
    \  A degenerate case of this multi-field classifier is a\n   Behavior Aggregate\
    \ classifier.  Other classifiers may be defined in\n   other MIB modules, to select\
    \ traffic from a given layer two neighbor\n   or a given interface, traffic whose\
    \ addresses belong to a given BGP\n   Community or Autonomous System, and so on.\n"
- title: 3.2.1.  diffServClfrElementTable - The Classifier Element Table
  contents:
  - "3.2.1.  diffServClfrElementTable - The Classifier Element Table\n   A classifier\
    \ consists of classifier elements.  A classifier element\n   identifies a specific\
    \ set of traffic that forms part of a behavior\n   aggregate; other classifier\
    \ elements within the same classifier may\n   identify other traffic that also\
    \ falls into the behavior aggregate.\n   For example, in identifying AF traffic\
    \ for the aggregate AF1, one\n   might implement separate classifier elements\
    \ for AF11, AF12, and AF13\n   within the same classifier and pointing to the\
    \ same subsequent meter.\n   Generally, one would expect the Data Path Entry to\
    \ point to a\n   classifier (which is to say, a set of one or more classifier\n\
    \   elements), although it may point to something else when appropriate.\n   Reclassification\
    \ in a functional data path is achieved by pointing to\n   another Classifier\
    \ Entry when appropriate.\n   A classifier element is a structural element, indexed\
    \ by classifier\n   ID and element ID.  It has a precedence value, allowing for\n\
    \   structured ambiguity as described above, a \"specific\" pointer that\n   identifies\
    \ what rule is to be applied, and a \"next\" pointer directing\n   traffic matching\
    \ the classifier to the next functional data path\n   element.  If the \"next\"\
    \ pointer is zeroDotZero, the indication is\n   that there is no further differentiated\
    \ services processing for this\n   behavior aggregate.  However, if the \"specific\"\
    \ pointer is\n   zeroDotZero, the device is misconfigured.  In such a case, the\n\
    \   classifier element should be operationally treated as if it were not\n   present.\n\
    \   When the MIB is used for configuration, diffServClfrNextFree and\n   diffServClfrElementNextFree\
    \ always contain legal values for\n   diffServClfrId and diffServClfrElementId\
    \ that are not currently used\n   in the system's configuration.  The values are\
    \ validated when\n   creating diffServClfrId and diffServClfrElementId, and in\
    \ the event\n   of a failure (which would happen if two managers simultaneously\n\
    \   attempted to create an entry) must be re-read.\n"

    \ functions that\n   operate on opposing ends of a link.  A shaper schedules traffic\
    \ for\n   transmission at specific times in order to approximate a particular\n\
    \   line speed or combination of line speeds.  In its simplest form, if\n   the\
    \ traffic stream contains constant sized packets, it might transmit\n   one packet\
    \ per unit time to build the equivalent of a CBR circuit.\n   However, various\
    \ factors intervene to make the approximation inexact;\n   multiple classes of\
    \ traffic may occasionally schedule their traffic\n   at the same time, the variable\
    \ length nature of IP traffic may\n   introduce variation, and factors in the\
    \ link or physical layer may\n   change traffic timing.  A meter integrates the\
    \ arrival rate of\n   traffic and determines whether the shaper at the far end\
    \ was\n   correctly applied, or whether the behavior of the application in\n \
    \  question is naturally close enough to such behavior to be acceptable\n   under\
    \ a given policy.\n   A common type of meter is a Token Bucket meter, such as\
    \ [srTCM] or\n   [trTCM].  This type of meter assumes the use of a shaper at a\n\
    \   previous node; applications which send at a constant rate when\n   sending\
    \ may conform if the token bucket is properly specified.  It\n   specifies the\
    \ acceptable arrival rate and quantifies the acceptable\n   variability, often\
    \ by specifying a burst size or an interval; since\n   rate = quantity/time, specifying\
    \ any two of those parameters implies\n   the third, and a large interval provides\
    \ for a forgiving system.\n   Multiple rates may be specified, as in AF, such\
    \ that a subset of the\n   traffic (up to one rate) is accepted with one set of\
    \ guarantees, and\n   traffic in excess of that but below another rate has a different\
    \ set\n   of guarantees.  Other types of meters exist as well.\n   One use of\
    \ a meter is when a service provider sells at most, a\n   certain bit rate to\
    \ one of its customers, and wants to drop the\n   excess.  In such a case, the\
    \ fractal nature of normal Internet\n   traffic must be reflected in large burst\
    \ intervals, as TCP frequently\n   sends packet pairs or larger bursts, and responds\
    \ poorly when more\n   than one packet in a round trip interval is dropped.  Applications\n\
    \   like FTP contain the effect by simply staying below the target bit\n   rate;\
    \ this type of configuration very adversely affects transaction\n   applications\
    \ like HTTP, however.  Another use of a meter is in the AF\n   specification,\
    \ in which excess traffic is marked with a related DSCP\n   and subjected to slightly\
    \ more active queue depth management.  The\n   application is not sharply limited\
    \ to a contracted rate in such a\n   case, but can be readily contained should\
    \ its traffic create a\n   burden.\n"

  contents:
  - "3.3.1.  diffServMeterTable - The Meter Table\n   The Meter Table is a structural\
    \ table, specifying a specific\n   functional data path element.  Its entry consists\
    \ essentially of\n   three RowPointers - a \"succeed\" pointer, for traffic conforming\
    \ to\n   the meter, a \"fail\" pointer, for traffic not conforming to the meter,\n\
    \   and a \"specific\" pointer, to identify the parameters in question.\n   This\
    \ structure is a bow to SNMP's limitations; it would be better to\n   have a structure\
    \ with N rates and N+1 \"next\" pointers, with a single\n   algorithm specified.\
    \  In this case, multiple meter entries connected\n   by the \"fail\" link are\
    \ understood to contain the parameters for a\n   specified algorithm, and traffic\
    \ conforming to a given rate follows\n   their \"succeed\" paths.  Within this\
    \ MIB, only Token Bucket parameters\n   are specified; other varieties of meters\

  - "3.3.2.  diffServTBParamTable - The Token Bucket Parameters Table\n   The Token\
    \ Bucket Parameters Table is a set of parameters that define\n   a Token Bucket\
    \ Meter.  As a parameter, a token bucket may be\n   specified once and applied\
    \ to many interfaces, using\n   diffServMeterSpecific.  Specifically, several\
    \ modes of [srTCM] and\n   [trTCM] are addressed.  Other varieties of meters may\
    \ be specified in\n   other MIB modules.\n   In general, if a Token Bucket has\
    \ N rates, it has N+1 potential\n   outcomes - the traffic stream is slower than\
    \ and therefore conforms\n   to all of the rates, it fails the first few but is\
    \ slower than and\n   therefore conforms to the higher rates, or it fails all\
    \ of them.  As\n   such, multi-rate meters should specify those rates in monotonically\n\
    \   increasing order, passing through the diffServMeterFailNext from more\n  \
    \ committed to more excess rates, and finally falling through\n   diffServMeterFailNext\
    \ to the set of actions that apply to traffic\n   which conforms to none of the\

    \ however, that there is ongoing research on this topic, see e.g.\n   [ACTQMGMT]\
    \ and [AQMROUTER].\n   Additional parameters may be added in an enterprise MIB\

- title: 4.1.  The use of RowPointer to indicate data path linkage
  contents:
  - "4.1.  The use of RowPointer to indicate data path linkage\n   RowPointer is a\
    \ textual convention used to identify a conceptual row\n   in a MIB Table by pointing\
    \ to one of its objects.  One of the ways\n   this MIB uses it is to indicate\
    \ succession, pointing to data path\n   linkage table entries.\n   For succession,\
    \ it answers the question \"what happens next?\".  Rather\n   than presume that\
    \ the next table must be as specified in the\n   conceptual model [MODEL] and\
    \ providing its index, the RowPointer\n   takes you to the MIB row representing\
    \ that thing.  In the\n   diffServMeterTable, for example, the diffServMeterFailNext\
    \ RowPointer\n   might take you to another meter, while the diffServMeterSucceedNext\n\
    \   RowPointer would take you to an action.\n   Since a RowPointer is not tied\
    \ to any specific object except by the\n   value it contains, it is possible and\
    \ acceptable to use RowPointers\n   to merge data paths.  An obvious example of\
    \ such a use is in the\n   classifier: traffic matching the DSCPs AF11, AF12,\
    \ and AF13 might be\n   presented to the same meter in order to perform the processing\n\
    \   described in the Assured Forwarding PHB.  Another use would be to\n   merge\
    \ data paths from several interfaces; if they represent a single\n   service contract,\
    \ having them share a common set of counters and\n   common policy may be a desirable\
    \ configuration.  Note well, however,\n   that such configurations may have related\
    \ implementation issues - if\n   Differentiated Services processing for the interfaces\
    \ is implemented\n   in multiple forwarding engines, the engines will need to\
    \ communicate\n   if they are to implement such a feature.  An implementation\
    \ that\n   fails to provide this capability is not considered to have failed the\n\
    \   intention of this MIB or of the [MODEL]; an implementation that does\n   provide\
    \ it is not considered superior from a standards perspective.\n      NOTE -- the\
    \ RowPointer construct is used to connect the functional\n      data paths.  The\
    \ [MODEL] describes these as TCBs, as an aid to\n      understanding.  This MIB,\
    \ however, does not model TCBs directly.\n      It operates at a lower level of\
    \ abstraction using only individual\n      elements, connected in succession by\
    \ RowPointers.  Therefore, the\n      concept of TCBs enclosing individual Functional\
    \ Data Path elements\n      is not directly applicable to this MIB, although management\
    \ tools\n      that use this MIB may employ such a concept.\n   It is possible\
    \ that a path through a device following a set of\n   RowPointers is indeterminate\
    \ i.e. it ends in a dangling RowPointer.\n   Guidance is provided in the MIB module's\
    \ DESCRIPTION-clause for each\n   of the linkage attribute.  In general, for both\
    \ zeroDotZero and\n   dangling RowPointer, it is assumed the data path ends and\
    \ the traffic\n   should be given to the next logical part of the device, usually\
    \ a\n   forwarding process or a transmission engine, or the proverbial bit-\n\
    \   bucket.  Any variation from this usage is indicated by the attribute\n   affected.\n"
- title: 4.2.  The use of RowPointer to indicate parameters
  contents:
  - "4.2.  The use of RowPointer to indicate parameters\n   RowPointer is also used\
    \ in this MIB to indicate parameterization, for\n   pointing to parameterization\
    \ table entries.\n   For indirection (as in the diffServClfrElementTable), the\
    \ idea is to\n   allow other MIBs, including proprietary ones, to define new and\n\
    \   arcane filters - MAC headers, IPv4 and IPv6 headers, BGP Communities\n   and\
    \ all sorts of other things - while still utilizing the structures\n   of this\
    \ MIB.  This is a form of class inheritance (in \"object\n   oriented\" language):\
    \ it allows base object definitions (\"classes\") to\n   be extended in proprietary\
    \ or standard ways, in the future, by other\n   documents.\n   RowPointer also\
    \ clearly indicates the identified conceptual row's\n   content does not change,\
    \ hence they can be simultaneously used and\n   pointed to, by more than one data\
    \ path linkage table entries.  The\n   identification of RowPointer allows higher\
    \ level policy mechanisms to\n   take advantage of this characteristic.\n"
- title: 4.3.  Conceptual row creation and deletion
  contents:
  - "4.3.  Conceptual row creation and deletion\n   A number of conceptual tables\
    \ defined in this MIB use as an index an\n   arbitrary integer value, unique across\
    \ the scope of the agent.  In\n   order to help with multi-manager row-creation\
    \ problems, a mechanism\n   must be provided to allow a manager to obtain unique\
    \ values for such\n   an index and to ensure that, when used, the manager knows\
    \ whether it\n   got what it wanted or not.\n   Typically, such a table has an\
    \ associated NextFree variable e.g.\n   diffServClfrNextFree which provides a\
    \ suitable value for the index of\n   the next row to be created e.g. diffServClfrId.\
    \  The value zero is\n   used to indicate that the agent can configure no more\
    \ entries.  The\n   table also has a columnar Status attribute with RowStatus\
    \ syntax [RFC\n   2579].\n   Generally, if a manager attempts to create a row,\
    \ the agent will\n   create the row and return success.  If the agent has insufficient\n\
    \   resources or such a row already exists, then it returns an error.  A\n   manager\
    \ must be prepared to try again in such circumstances, probably\n   by re-reading\
    \ the NextFree to obtain a new index value in case a\n   second manager had got\
    \ in between the first manager's read of the\n   NextFree value and the first\
    \ manager's row-creation attempt.\n   To simplify management creation and deletion\
    \ of rows in this MIB, the\n   agent is expected to assist in maintaining its\
    \ consistency.  It may\n   accomplish this by maintaining internal usage counters\
    \ for any row\n   that might be pointed to by a RowPointer, or by any equivalent\
    \ means.\n   When a RowPointer is created or written, and the row it points to\n\
    \   does not exist, the SET returns an inconsistentValue error.  When a\n   RowStatus\
    \ variable is set to 'destroy' but the usage counter is non-\n   zero, the SET\
    \ returns no error but the indicated row is left intact.\n   The agent should\
    \ later remove the row in the event that the usage\n   counter becomes zero.\n\
    \   The use of RowStatus is covered in more detail in [RFC 2579].\n"
- title: 5.  Extending this MIB
  contents:
  - "5.  Extending this MIB\n   With the structures of this MIB divided into data\
    \ path linkage tables\n   and parameterization tables, and with the use of RowPointer,\
    \ new data\n   path linkage and parameterization tables can be defined in other\
    \ MIB\n   modules, and used with tables defined in this MIB.  This MIB does not\n\
    \   limit the type of entries its RowPointer attributes can point to,\n   hence\
    \ new functional data path elements can be defined in other MIBs\n   and integrated\
    \ with functional data path elements of this MIB.  For\n   example, new Action\
    \ functional data path element can be defined for\n   Traffic Engineering and\
    \ be integrated with Differentiated Services\n   functional data path elements,\
    \ possibly used within the same data\n   path sharing the same classifiers and\
    \ meters.\n   It is more likely that new parameterization tables will be created\
    \ in\n   other MIBs as new methods or proprietary methods get deployed for\n \
    \  existing Differentiated Services Functional Data Path Elements.  For\n   example,\
    \ different kinds of filters can be defined by using new\n   filter parameterization\
    \ tables.  New scheduling methods can be\n   deployed by defining new scheduling\
    \ method OIDs and new scheduling\n   parameter tables.\n   Notice both new data\
    \ path linkage tables and parameterization tables\n   can be added without needing\
    \ to change this MIB document or affect\n   existing tables and their usage.\n"

    \    requires further specification in some other MIB module.\n       In the tailDrop(2)\

    \ the queue, pointed to by\n       diffServAlgDropQMeasure, beyond which all newly\
    \ arriving packets\n       will be dropped.\n       In the headDrop(3) algorithm,\
    \ if a packet arrives when the\n       current depth of the queue, pointed to\
    \ by\n       diffServAlgDropQMeasure, is at diffServAlgDropQThreshold, packets\n\
    \       currently at the head of the queue are dropped to make room for\n    \
    \   the new packet to be enqueued at the tail of the queue.\n       In the randomDrop(4)\
    \ algorithm, on packet arrival, an Active\n       Queue Management algorithm is\
    \ executed which may randomly drop a\n       packet. This algorithm may be proprietary,\

- title: 8.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "8.  Security Considerations\n   It is clear that this MIB is potentially useful\
    \ for configuration.\n   Anything that can be configured can be misconfigured,\
    \ with\n   potentially disastrous effects.\n   At this writing, no security holes\
    \ have been identified beyond those\n   that SNMP Security is itself intended\
    \ to address.  These relate\n   primarily to controlled access to sensitive information\
    \ and the\n   ability to configure a device - or which might result from operator\n\
    \   error, which is beyond the scope of any security architecture.\n   There are\
    \ many read-write and read-create management objects defined\n   in this MIB.\
    \  Such objects are often sensitive or vulnerable in some\n   network environments.\
    \  The support for SET operations in a non-secure\n   environment without proper\
    \ protection can have a negative effect on\n   network operations.  The use of\
    \ SNMP Version 3 is recommended over\n   prior versions for configuration control\
    \ as its security model is\n   improved.\n   There are a number of managed objects\
    \ in this MIB that may contain\n   information that may be sensitive from a business\
    \ perspective, in\n   that they may represent a customer's service contract or\
    \ the filters\n   that the service provider chooses to apply to a customer's ingress\
    \ or\n   egress traffic.  There are no objects which are sensitive in their\n\
    \   own right, such as passwords or monetary amounts.\n   It may be important\
    \ to even control GET access to these objects and\n   possibly to even encrypt\
    \ the values of these objects when sending\n   them over the network via SNMP.\
    \  Not all versions of SNMP provide\n   features for such a secure environment.\n\
    \   SNMPv1 by itself is not a secure environment.  Even if the network\n   itself\
    \ is secure (for example by using IPSec), even then, there is no\n   control as\
    \ to who on the secure network is allowed to access and\n   GET/SET (read/change/create/delete)\
    \ the objects in this MIB.\n   It is recommended that the implementors consider\
    \ the security\n   features as provided by the SNMPv3 framework.  Specifically,\
    \ the use\n   of the User-based Security Model [RFC 2574] and the View-based Access\n\
    \   Control Model [RFC 2575] is recommended.\n   It is then a customer/user responsibility\
    \ to ensure that the SNMP\n   entity giving access to an instance of this MIB,\
    \ is properly\n   configured to give access to the objects only to those principals\n\
    \   (users) that have legitimate rights to indeed GET or SET\n   (change/create/delete)\
    \ them.\n"
