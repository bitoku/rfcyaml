  - "1.  Introduction\n   In the past, the IAB has published a number of documents\
    \ relating to\n   Internet transparency and the end-to-end principle, and other\
    \ IETF\n   documents have also touched on these issues as well.  These documents\n\
    \   articulate the general principles on which the Internet architecture\n   is\
    \ based, as well as the core values that the Internet community\n   seeks to protect\
    \ going forward.  This document reaffirms those\n   principles, describes the\
    \ concept of \"oblivious transport\" as\n   developed in the DARPA NewArch project\
    \ [NewArch], and addresses a\n   number of new transparency issues.\n   A network\
    \ that does not filter or transform the data that it carries\n   may be said to\
    \ be \"transparent\" or \"oblivious\" to the content of\n   packets.  Networks\
    \ that provide oblivious transport enable the\n   deployment of new services without\
    \ requiring changes to the core.  It\n   is this flexibility that is perhaps both\
    \ the Internet's most\n   essential characteristic as well as one of the most\
    \ important\n   contributors to its success.\n   \"Architectural Principles of\
    \ the Internet\" [RFC1958], Section 2\n   describes the core tenets of the Internet\
    \ architecture:\n      However, in very general terms, the community believes\
    \ that the\n      goal is connectivity, the tool is the Internet Protocol, and\
    \ the\n      intelligence is end to end rather than hidden in the network.\n \
    \     The current exponential growth of the network seems to show that\n     \
    \ connectivity is its own reward, and is more valuable than any\n      individual\
    \ application such as mail or the World-Wide Web.  This\n      connectivity requires\
    \ technical cooperation between service\n      providers, and flourishes in the\
    \ increasingly liberal and\n      competitive commercial telecommunications environment.\n\
    \   \"The Rise of the Middle and the Future of End-to-End:  Reflections on\n \
    \  the Evolution of the Internet Architecture\" [RFC3724], Section 4.1.1\n   describes\
    \ some of the desirable consequences of this approach:\n      One desirable consequence\
    \ of the end-to-end principle is\n      protection of innovation.  Requiring modification\
    \ in the network\n      in order to deploy new services is still typically more\
    \ difficult\n      than modifying end nodes.  The counterargument - that many\
    \ end\n      nodes are now essentially closed boxes which are not updatable and\n\
    \      that most users don't want to update them anyway - does not apply\n   \
    \   to all nodes and all users.  Many end nodes are still user\n      configurable\
    \ and a sizable percentage of users are \"early\n      adopters,\" who are willing\
    \ to put up with a certain amount of\n      technological grief in order to try\
    \ out a new idea.  And, even for\n      the closed boxes and uninvolved users,\
    \ downloadable code that\n      abides by the end-to-end principle can provide\
    \ fast service\n      innovation.  Requiring someone with a new idea for a service\
    \ to\n      convince a bunch of ISPs or corporate network administrators to\n\
    \      modify their networks is much more difficult than simply putting\n    \
    \  up a Web page with some downloadable software implementing the\n      service.\n\
    \   Yet, even while the Internet has greatly expanded both in size and in\n  \
    \ application diversity, the degree of transparency has diminished.\n   \"Internet\
    \ Transparency\" [RFC2775] notes some of the causes for the\n   loss of Internet\
    \ transparency and analyzes their impact.  This\n   includes discussion of Network\
    \ Address Translators (NATs), firewalls,\n   application level gateways (ALGs),\
    \ relays, proxies, caches, split\n   Domain Name Service (DNS), load balancers,\
    \ etc.  [RFC2775] also\n   analyzes potential future directions that could lead\
    \ to the\n   restoration of transparency.  Section 6 summarizes the conclusions:\n\
    \      Although the pure IPv6 scenario is the cleanest and simplest, it\n    \
    \  is not straightforward to reach it.  The various scenarios without\n      use\
    \ of IPv6 are all messy and ultimately seem to lead to dead ends\n      of one\
    \ kind or another.  Partial deployment of IPv6, which is a\n      required step\
    \ on the road to full deployment, is also messy but\n      avoids the dead ends.\n\
    \   While full restoration of Internet transparency through the\n   deployment\
    \ of IPv6 remains a goal, the Internet's growing role in\n   society, the increasing\
    \ diversity of applications, and the continued\n   growth in security threats\
    \ has altered the balance between\n   transparency and security, and the disparate\
    \ goals of interested\n   parties make these tradeoffs inherently complex.\n \
    \  While transparency provides great flexibility, it also makes it\n   easier\
    \ to deliver unwanted as well as wanted traffic.  Unwanted\n   traffic is increasingly\
    \ cited as a justification for limiting\n   transparency.  If taken to its logical\
    \ conclusion, this argument will\n   lead to the development of ever more complex\
    \ transparency barriers to\n   counter increasingly sophisticated security threats.\
    \  Transparency,\n   once lost, is hard to regain, so that such an approach, if\n\
    \   unsuccessful, would lead to an Internet that is both insecure and\n   lacking\
    \ in transparency.  The alternative is to develop increasingly\n   sophisticated\
    \ host-based security mechanisms; while such an approach\n   may also fail to\
    \ keep up with increasingly sophisticated security\n   threats, it is less likely\
    \ to sacrifice transparency in the process.\n   Since many of the fundamental\
    \ forces that have led to a reduction in\n   the transparency of the IPv4 Internet\
    \ also may play a role in the\n   IPv6 Internet, the transparency of the IPv6\
    \ Internet is not pre-\n   ordained, but rather represents an ideal whose maintenance\
    \ will\n   require significant ongoing effort.\n   As noted in [NewArch], the\
    \ technical cooperation that once\n   characterized the development of the Internet\
    \ has increasingly given\n   way to a tussle between the interests of subscribers,\
    \ vendors,\n   providers, and society at large.  Oblivious transport may be desired\n\
    \   by developers seeking to deploy new services; providers may desire to\n  \
    \ block unwanted traffic in the core before it impacts subscribers;\n   vendors\
    \ and providers may wish to enable delivery of \"value added\"\n   services in\
    \ the network that enable them to differentiate their\n   offerings; subscribers\
    \ may be sympathetic to either point of view,\n   depending on their interests;\
    \ society at large may wish to block\n   \"offensive\" material and monitor traffic\
    \ that shows malicious intent.\n   While there is no architectural \"fix\" that\
    \ can restore oblivious\n   transport while satisfying the interests of all parties,\
    \ it is\n   possible for providers to provide subscribers with information about\n\
    \   the nature of the services being provided.  Subscribers need to be\n   aware\
    \ of whether they are receiving oblivious transport, and if not,\n   how the service\
    \ affects their traffic.\n   Since the publication of the previously cited IAB\
    \ statements, new\n   technologies have been developed, and views on existing\
    \ technology\n   have changed.  In some cases, these new technologies impact oblivious\n\
    \   transport, and subscribers need to be aware of the implications for\n   their\
    \ service.\n"

- title: 2.1.  Application Restriction
  contents:
  - "2.1.  Application Restriction\n   Since one of the virtues of the Internet architecture\
    \ is the ease\n   with which new applications can be deployed, practices that\
    \ restrict\n   the ability to deploy new applications have the potential to reduce\n\
    \   innovation.\n   One such practice is filtering designed to block or restrict\n\
    \   application usage, implemented without customer consent.  This\n   includes\
    \ Internet, Transport, and Application layer filtering\n   designed to block or\
    \ restrict traffic associated with one or more\n   applications.\n   While provider\
    \ filtering may be useful to address security issues\n   such as attacks on provider\
    \ infrastructure or denial of service\n   attacks, greater flexibility is provided\
    \ by allowing filtering to be\n   determined by the customer.  Typically, this\
    \ would be implemented at\n   the edges, such as within provider access routers\
    \ (e.g., outsourced\n   firewall services), customer premise equipment (e.g.,\
    \ access\n   firewalls), or on hosts (e.g., host firewalls).  Deployment of\n\
    \   filtering at the edges provides customers with the flexibility to\n   choose\
    \ which applications they wish to block or restrict, whereas\n   filtering in\
    \ the core may not permit hosts to communicate, even when\n   the communication\
    \ would conform to the appropriate use policies of\n   the administrative domains\
    \ to which those hosts belong.\n   In practice, filtering intended to block or\
    \ restrict application\n   usage is difficult to successfully implement without\
    \ customer\n   consent, since over time developers will tend to re-engineer filtered\n\
    \   protocols so as to avoid the filters.  Thus over time, filtering is\n   likely\
    \ to result in interoperability issues or unnecessary\n   complexity.  These costs\
    \ come without the benefit of effective\n   filtering since many application protocols\
    \ began to use HTTP as a\n   transport protocol after application developers observed\
    \ that\n   firewalls allow HTTP traffic while dropping packets for unknown\n \
    \  protocols.\n   In addition to architectural concerns, filtering to block or\
    \ restrict\n   application usage also raises issues of disclosure and end-user\n\
    \   consent.  As pointed out in \"Terminology for Describing Internet\n   Connectivity\"\
    \ [RFC4084], services advertised as providing \"Internet\n   connectivity\" differ\
    \ considerably in their capabilities, leading to\n   confusion.  The document\
    \ defines terminology relating to Internet\n   connectivity, including \"Web connectivity\"\
    , \"Client connectivity\n   only, without a public address\", \"Client only, public\
    \ address\",\n   \"Firewalled Internet Connectivity\", and \"Full Internet Connectivity\"\
    .\n   With respect to \"Full Internet Connectivity\" [RFC4084], Section 2\n  \
    \ notes:\n      Filtering Web proxies, interception proxies, NAT, and other\n\
    \      provider-imposed restrictions on inbound or outbound ports and\n      traffic\
    \ are incompatible with this type of service.  Servers ...\n      are typically\
    \ considered normal.  The only compatible restrictions\n      are bandwidth limitations\
    \ and prohibitions against network abuse\n      or illegal activities.\n   [RFC4084],\
    \ Section 4 describes disclosure obligations that apply to\n   all forms of service\
    \ limitation, whether applied on outbound or\n   inbound traffic:\n      More\
    \ generally, the provider should identify any actions of the\n      service to\
    \ block, restrict, or alter the destination of, the\n      outbound use (i.e.,\
    \ the use of services not supplied by the\n      provider or on the provider's\
    \ network) of applications services.\n   In essence, [RFC4084] calls for providers\
    \ to declare the ways in\n   which the service provided departs from oblivious\
    \ transport.  Since\n   the lack of oblivious transport within transit networks\
    \ will also\n   affect transparency, this also applies to providers over whose\n\
    \   network the subscriber's traffic may travel.\n"
- title: 2.2.  Quality of Service (QoS)
  contents:
  - "2.2.  Quality of Service (QoS)\n   While [RFC4084] notes that bandwidth limitations\
    \ are compatible with\n   \"Full Internet Connectivity\", in some cases QoS restrictions\
    \ may go\n   beyond simple average or peak bandwidth limitations.  When used to\n\
    \   restrict the ability to deploy new applications, QoS mechanisms are\n   incompatible\
    \ with \"Full Internet Connectivity\" as defined in\n   [RFC4084].  The disclosure\
    \ and consent obligations referred to in\n   [RFC4084], Section 4 also apply to\
    \ QoS mechanisms.\n   Deployment of QoS technology has potential implications\
    \ for Internet\n   transparency, since the QoS experienced by a flow can make\
    \ the\n   Internet more or less oblivious to that flow.  While QoS support is\n\
    \   highly desirable in order for real-time services to coexist with\n   elastic\
    \ services, it is not without impact on packet delivery.\n   Specifically, QoS\
    \ classes such as \"default\" [RFC2474] or \"lower\n   effort\" [RFC3662] may\
    \ experience higher random-loss rates than others\n   such as \"assured forwarding\"\
    \ [RFC2597].  Conversely, bandwidth-\n   limited QoS classes such as \"expedited\
    \ forwarding\" [RFC3246] may\n   experience systematic packet loss if they exceed\
    \ their assigned\n   bandwidth.  Other QoS mechanisms such as load balancing may\
    \ have\n   side-effects such as re-ordering of packets, which may have a serious\n\
    \   impact on perceived performance.\n   QoS implementations that reduce the ability\
    \ to deploy new\n   applications on the Internet are similar in effect to other\n\
    \   transparency barriers.  Since arbitrary or severe bandwidth\n   limitations\
    \ can make an application unusable, the introduction of\n   application-specific\
    \ bandwidth limitations is equivalent to\n   application blocking or restriction\
    \ from a user's standpoint.\n   Using QoS mechanisms to discriminate against traffic\
    \ not matching a\n   set of services or addresses has a similar effect to deployment\
    \ of a\n   highly restrictive firewall.  Requiring an authenticated RSVP\n   reservation\
    \ [RFC2747][RFC3182] for a flow to avoid severe packet loss\n   has a similar\
    \ effect to deployment of authenticated firewall\n   traversal.\n   As with filtering,\
    \ there may be valid uses for customer-imposed QoS\n   restrictions.  For example,\
    \ a customer may wish to limit the\n   bandwidth consumed by peer-to-peer file\
    \ sharing services, so as to\n   limit the impact on mission-critical applications.\n"
- title: 2.3.  Application Layer Gateways (ALGs)
  contents:
  - "2.3.  Application Layer Gateways (ALGs)\n   The IAB has devoted considerable\
    \ attention to Network Address\n   Translation (NAT), so that there is little\
    \ need to repeat that\n   discussion here.  However, with the passage of time,\
    \ it has become\n   apparent that there are problems inherent in the deployment\
    \ of\n   Application Layer Gateways (ALGs) (frequently embedded within\n   firewalls\
    \ and devices implementing NAT).\n   [RFC2775], Section 3.5 states:\n      If\
    \ the full range of Internet applications is to be used, NATs\n      have to be\
    \ coupled with application level gateways (ALGs) or\n      proxies.  Furthermore,\
    \ the ALG or proxy must be updated whenever a\n      new address-dependent application\
    \ comes along.  In practice, NAT\n      functionality is built into many firewall\
    \ products, and all useful\n      NATs have associated ALGs, so it is difficult\
    \ to disentangle their\n      various impacts.\n   With the passage of time and\
    \ development of NAT traversal\n   technologies such as IKE NAT-T [RFC3947], Teredo\
    \ [RFC4380], and STUN\n   [RFC3489], it has become apparent that ALGs represent\
    \ an additional\n   barrier to transparency.  In addition to posing barriers to\
    \ the\n   deployment of new applications not yet supported by ALGs, ALGs may\n\
    \   create difficulties in the deployment of existing applications as\n   well\
    \ as updated versions.  For example, in the development of IKE\n   NAT-T, additional\
    \ difficulties were presented by \"IPsec Helper\" ALGs\n   embedded within NATs.\n\
    \   It should be stressed that these difficulties are inherent in the\n   architecture\
    \ of ALGs, rather than merely an artifact of poor\n   implementations.  No matter\
    \ how well an ALG is implemented, barriers\n   to transparency will emerge over\
    \ time, so that the notion of a\n   \"transparent ALG\" is a contradiction in\
    \ terms.\n   In particular, DNS ALGs present a host of issues, including\n   incompatibilities\
    \ with DNSSEC that prevent deployment of a secure\n   naming infrastructure even\
    \ if all the endpoints are upgraded.  For\n   details, see \"Reasons to Move the\
    \ Network Address Translator -\n   Protocol Translator (NAT-PT) to Historic Status\"\
    \ [RFC4966], Section\n   3.\n"

  contents:
  - "2.4.  IPv6 Address Restrictions\n   [RFC2775], Section 5.1 states:\n      Note\
    \ that it is a basic assumption of IPv6 that no artificial\n      constraints\
    \ will be placed on the supply of addresses, given that\n      there are so many\
    \ of them.  Current practices by which some ISPs\n      strongly limit the number\
    \ of IPv4 addresses per client will have\n      no reason to exist for IPv6.\n\
    \   Constraints on the supply of IPv6 addresses provide an incentive for\n   the\
    \ deployment of NAT with IPv6.  The introduction of NAT for IPv6\n   would represent\
    \ a barrier to transparency, and therefore is to be\n   avoided if at all possible.\n"

  contents:
  - "2.4.1.  Allocation of IPv6 Addresses by Providers\n   In order to encourage deployments\
    \ of IPv6 to provide oblivious\n   transport, it is important that IPv6 networks\
    \ of all sizes be\n   supplied with a prefix sufficient to enable allocation of\
    \ addresses\n   and sub-networks for all the hosts and links within their network.\n\
    \   Initial address allocation policy suggested allocating a /48 prefix\n   to\
    \ \"small\" sites, which should handle typical requirements.  Any\n   changes\
    \ to allocation policy should take into account the\n   transparency reduction\
    \ that will result from further restriction.\n   For example, provider provisioning\
    \ of a single /64 without support\n   for prefix delegation or (worse still) a\
    \ longer prefix (prohibited by\n   [RFC4291], Section 2.5.4 for non-000/3 unicast\

    \ particular,\n      IPv6 stateless autoconfiguration or router advertisement\
    \ messages\n      are not used; neither is neighbor discovery.\n   IKEv2 provides\
    \ for the assignment of a single IPv6 address, using the\n   INTERNAL_IP6_ADDRESS\
    \ attribute.  If this is the only attribute\n   supported for IPv6 address assignment,\
    \ then only a single IPv6\n   address will be available.  The INTERNAL_IP6_SUBNET\
    \ attribute enables\n   the host to determine the sub-networks accessible directly\

    \ one\n   or more prefixes to the IKEv2 initiator that could be used for\n   address\
    \ creation.\n   However, this does not enable the host to obtain prefixes that\
    \ can be\n   delegated.  The INTERNAL_IP6_DHCP attribute provides the address\
    \ of a\n   DHCPv6 server, potentially enabling use of DHCPv6 prefix delegation\n\

    \ been reports of\n   providers implementing recursive nameservers and/or DNS\

    \  Although wildcard labels in top-level domains\n   lead to problems that are\

    \ service, techniques\n   have been deployed that result in packets being redirected\
    \ or taking\n   a different path depending on where the request originates.  For\n\
    \   example, requests may be distributed among servers using \"reverse\n   NAT\"\
    \ (which modifies the destination rather than the source address);\n   responses\
    \ to DNS requests may be altered; HTTP \"gets\" may be re-\n   directed; or specific\
    \ packets may be diverted onto overlay networks.\n   Provided that these services\

    \ pointed to\n       a server near the DNS server, rather than a server near the\
    \ host.\n       HTTP re-direction does not encounter this issue.\n   [3] If the\
    \ packet filters that divert packets onto overlay networks\n       are misconfigured,\
    \ this can lead to packets being misdirected\n       onto the overlay and delayed\
    \ or lost if the far end cannot return\n       them to the global Internet.\n\
    \   [4] The use of anycast needs to be carefully thought out so that\n       service\
    \ can be maintained in the face of routing changes.\n"

  - "3.  Security Considerations\n   Several transparency issues discussed in this\
    \ document (NATs,\n   transparent proxies, DNS namespace mangling) weaken existing\
    \ end-to-\n   end security guarantees and interfere with the deployment of\n \
    \  protocols that would strengthen end-to-end security.\n   [RFC2775], Section\
    \ 7 states:\n      The loss of transparency at the Intranet/Internet boundary\
    \ may be\n      considered a security feature, since it provides a well defined\n\
    \      point at which to apply restrictions.  This form of security is\n     \
    \ subject to the \"crunchy outside, soft inside\" risk, whereby any\n      successful\
    \ penetration of the boundary exposes the entire Intranet\n      to trivial attack.\
    \  The lack of end-to-end security applied within\n      the Intranet also ignores\
    \ insider threats.\n   Today, malware has evolved to increasingly take advantage\
    \ of the\n   application-layer as a rich and financially attractive source of\n\
    \   security vulnerabilities, as well as a mechanism for penetration of\n   the\
    \ Intranet/Internet boundary.  This has lessened the security value\n   of existing\
    \ transparency barriers and made it increasingly difficult\n   to prevent the\
    \ propagation of malware without imposing restrictions\n   on application behavior.\
    \  However, as with other approaches to\n   application restriction (see Section\
    \ 2.1), these limitations are most\n   flexibly imposed at the edge.\n"
