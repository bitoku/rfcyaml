- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   This document defines several subcodes for the BGP [RFC4271]\
    \ Finite\n   State Machine (FSM) Error that could provide more information to\
    \ help\n   network operators in diagnosing BGP FSM issues and correlating\n  \
    \ network events.  This information is also helpful to developers in\n   lab situations.\
    \  This document updates [RFC4271] by requiring that\n   BGP implementations insert\
    \ appropriate FSM Error subcodes in\n   NOTIFICATION messages for BGP FSM errors.\n"
- title: 2.  Requirements Language
  contents:
  - "2.  Requirements Language\n   The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\"\
    , \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"\
    MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n   document are to be interpreted as described\
    \ in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].\n"
- title: 3.  Definition of Finite State Machine Error Subcodes
  contents:
  - "3.  Definition of Finite State Machine Error Subcodes\n   This document defines\
    \ the following subcodes for the BGP Finite State\n   Machine Error:\n   0 - Unspecified\
    \ Error\n   1 - Receive Unexpected Message in OpenSent State\n   2 - Receive Unexpected\
    \ Message in OpenConfirm State\n   3 - Receive Unexpected Message in Established\
    \ State\n"
- title: 4.  Usage of FSM Error Subcodes
  contents:
  - "4.  Usage of FSM Error Subcodes\n   If a BGP speaker receives an unexpected message\
    \ (e.g., KEEPALIVE/\n   UPDATE/ROUTE-REFRESH message) on a session in OpenSent\
    \ state, it MUST\n   send to the neighbor a NOTIFICATION message with the Error\
    \ Code\n   Finite State Machine Error and the Error Subcode \"Receive Unexpected\n\
    \   Message in OpenSent State\".  The Data field is a 1-octet, unsigned\n   integer\
    \ that indicates the type of the unexpected message.\n   If a BGP speaker receives\
    \ an unexpected message (e.g., OPEN/UPDATE/\n   ROUTE-REFRESH message) on a session\
    \ in OpenConfirm state, it MUST\n   send a NOTIFICATION message with the Error\
    \ Code Finite State Machine\n   Error and the Error Subcode \"Receive Unexpected\
    \ Message in\n   OpenConfirm State\" to the neighbor.  The Data field is a 1-octet,\n\
    \   unsigned integer that indicates the type of the unexpected message.\n   If\
    \ a BGP speaker receives an unexpected message (e.g., OPEN message)\n   on a session\
    \ in Established State, it MUST send to the neighbor a\n   NOTIFICATION message\
    \ with the Error Code Finite State Machine Error\n   and the Error Subcode \"\
    Receive Unexpected Message in Established\n   State\".  The Data field is a 1-octet,\
    \ unsigned integer that indicates\n   the type of the unexpected message.\n"
- title: 5.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "5.  Security Considerations\n   Specification, implementation, and deployment\
    \ of the proposed BGP FSM\n   Error subcodes could make BGP implementation fingerprinting\
    \ easier\n   and probably more accurate.  Operators using BGP need to consider\n\
    \   this as an operational security consideration of their BGP deployment\n  \
    \ decisions.\n   [BFMR2010] discusses a number of BGP security issues and potential\n\
    \   solutions that might be relevant both to BGP implementers and BGP\n   operators.\n"
- title: 6.  IANA Considerations
  contents:
  - "6.  IANA Considerations\n   IANA has created the registry \"BGP Finite State\
    \ Machine Error\n   Subcodes\", within the \"BGP Error Subcodes\" registry, with\
    \ a\n   Registration Procedure of \"Standards Action\" as defined in [RFC5226]\n\
    \   (early allocation of such subcodes is allowed, in accordance with\n   [RFC4020]).\n\
    \   The registry has been populated with the following values:\n   Value     \
    \ Name\n     0        Unspecified Error\n     1        Receive Unexpected Message\
    \ in OpenSent State\n     2        Receive Unexpected Message in OpenConfirm State\n\
    \     3        Receive Unexpected Message in Established State\n"
