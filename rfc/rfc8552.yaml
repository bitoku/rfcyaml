- title: Abstract
  contents:
  - "Abstract\n   Formally, any DNS Resource Record (RR) may occur under any domain\n\
    \   name.  However, some services use an operational convention for\n   defining\
    \ specific interpretations of an RRset by locating the records\n   in a DNS branch\
    \ under the parent domain to which the RRset actually\n   applies.  The top of\
    \ this subordinate branch is defined by a naming\n   convention that uses a reserved\
    \ node name, which begins with the\n   underscore character (e.g., \"_name\").\
    \  The underscored naming\n   construct defines a semantic scope for DNS record\
    \ types that are\n   associated with the parent domain above the underscored branch.\
    \  This\n   specification explores the nature of this DNS usage and defines the\n\
    \   \"Underscored and Globally Scoped DNS Node Names\" registry with IANA.\n \
    \  The purpose of this registry is to avoid collisions resulting from\n   the\
    \ use of the same underscored name for different services.\n"

  - "1.  Introduction\n   The core Domain Name System (DNS) technical specifications\
    \ ([RFC1035]\n   and [RFC2181]) assign no semantics to domain names or their parts,\n\
    \   and no constraints upon which resource record (RR) types are\n   permitted\
    \ to be stored under particular names [RFC1035] [RFC2181].\n   Over time, some\
    \ leaf node names, such as \"www\" and \"ftp\", have come\n   to imply support\
    \ for particular services, but this is a matter of\n   operational convention\
    \ rather than defined protocol semantics.  This\n   freedom in the basic technology\
    \ has permitted a wide range of\n   administrative and semantic policies to be\
    \ used -- in parallel.  DNS\n   data semantics have been limited to the specification\
    \ of particular\n   resource record types on the expectation that new resource\
    \ record\n   types would be added as needed.  Unfortunately, the addition of new\n\
    \   resource record types has proven extremely challenging, with\n   significant\
    \ adoption and use barriers occurring over the life of the\n   DNS.\n"
- title: 1.1.  Underscore-Based Scoping
  contents:
  - "1.1.  Underscore-Based Scoping\n   As an alternative to defining a new RR TYPE,\
    \ some DNS service\n   enhancements call for using an existing resource record\
    \ type but\n   specifying a restricted scope for its occurrence.  Scope is meant\
    \ as\n   a static property, not one dependent on the nature of the query.  It\n\
    \   is an artifact of the DNS name.  That scope is a leaf node containing\n  \
    \ the specific resource record sets that are formally defined and\n   constrained.\
    \  Specifically:\n      The leaf occurs in a branch having a distinguished naming\n\
    \      convention: there is a parent domain name to which the scoped data\n  \
    \    applies.  The branch is under this name.  The sub-branch is\n      indicated\
    \ by a sequence of one or more reserved DNS node names; at\n      least the first\
    \ (highest) of these names begins with an underscore\n      (e.g., \"_name\").\n\
    \   Because the DNS rules for a \"host\" (host name) do not allow use of\n   the\
    \ underscore character, the underscored name is distinguishable\n   from all legal\
    \ host names [RFC0952].  Effectively, this convention\n   for naming leaf nodes\
    \ creates a space for the listing of \"attributes\"\n   -- in the form of resource\
    \ record types -- that are associated with\n   the parent domain above the underscored\
    \ sub-branch.\n   The scoping feature is particularly useful when generalized\
    \ resource\n   record types are used -- notably \"TXT\", \"SRV\", and \"URI\"\
    \ [RFC1035]\n   [RFC2782] [RFC6335] [RFC7553].  It provides efficient separation\
    \ of\n   one use of them from others.  Absent this separation, an\n   undifferentiated\
    \ mass of these RRsets is returned to the DNS client,\n   which then must parse\
    \ through the internals of the records in the\n   hope of finding ones that are\
    \ relevant.  Worse, in some cases, the\n   results are ambiguous because a record\
    \ type might not adequately\n   self-identify its specific purpose.  With underscore-based\
    \ scoping,\n   only the relevant RRsets are returned.\n   A simple example is\
    \ DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM) [RFC6376],\n   which uses \"_domainkey\" to\
    \ define a place to hold a TXT record\n   containing signing information for the\
    \ parent domain.\n   This specification formally defines how underscored names\
    \ are used as\n   \"attribute\" enhancements for their parent domain names.  For\
    \ example,\n   the domain name \"_domainkey.example.\" acts as an attribute of\
    \ the\n   parent domain name \"example.\".  To avoid collisions resulting from\n\
    \   the use of the same underscored names for different applications\n   using\
    \ the same resource record type, this document establishes the\n   \"Underscored\
    \ and Globally Scoped DNS Node Names\" registry with IANA.\n   Use of such node\
    \ names, which begin with an underscore character, is\n   reserved when they are\
    \ the underscored name closest to the DNS root;\n   as in that case, they are\
    \ considered \"global\".  Underscored names\n   that are farther down the hierarchy\
    \ are handled within the scope of\n   the global underscored node name.\n   The\
    \ key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n\
    \   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"NOT RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\"\
    , and\n   \"OPTIONAL\" in this document are to be interpreted as described in\n\
    \   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all\n   capitals,\
    \ as shown here.\n"
- title: 1.2.  Scaling Benefits
  contents:
  - "1.2.  Scaling Benefits\n   Some resource record types are used in a fashion that\
    \ can create\n   scaling problems if an entire RRset associated with a domain\
    \ name is\n   aggregated in the leaf node for that name.  An increasingly popular\n\
    \   approach, with excellent scaling properties, places the RRset under a\n  \
    \ specially named branch, which is in turn under the node name that\n   would\
    \ otherwise contain the RRset.  The rules for naming that branch\n   define the\
    \ context for interpreting the RRset.  That is, rather than:\n               \
    \             domain-name.example\n                              /\n         \
    \                    RRset\n   the arrangement is:\n                        _branch.domain-name.example\n\
    \                          /\n                         RRset\n   A direct lookup\
    \ to the subordinate leaf node produces only the\n   desired record types, at\
    \ no greater cost than a typical DNS lookup.\n"
- title: 1.3.  Global Underscored Node Names
  contents:
  - "1.3.  Global Underscored Node Names\n   As defined in [RFC1034], the DNS uses\
    \ names organized in a tree-\n   structured or hierarchical fashion.  A domain\
    \ name might have\n   multiple node names that begin with the underscore character\
    \ (e.g.,\n   \"_name\").  A global underscored node name is the one that is closest\n\
    \   to the root of the DNS hierarchy, also called the highest level or\n   topmost.\
    \  In the presentation convention described in Section 3.1 of\n   [RFC1034], this\
    \ is the rightmost name beginning with an underscore.\n   In other presentation\
    \ environments, it might be positioned\n   differently.  To avoid concern for\
    \ the presentation variations, the\n   qualifier \"global\" is used here.\n"
- title: 1.4.  Interaction with DNS Wildcards
  contents:
  - "1.4.  Interaction with DNS Wildcards\n   DNS wildcards interact poorly with underscored\
    \ names in two ways:\n   Since wildcards are only interpreted as leaf names, one\
    \ cannot create\n   the equivalent of a wildcard name for prefixed names.  A name\
    \ such as\n   label.*.example.com is not a wildcard.\n   Conversely, a wildcard\
    \ such as *.example.com can match any name\n   including an underscored name.\
    \  So, a wildcard might match an\n   underscored name, returning a record that\
    \ is the type controlled by\n   the underscored name but is not intended to be\
    \ used in the\n   underscored context and does not conform to its rules.\n"
- title: 1.5.  History
  contents:
  - "1.5.  History\n   Originally, different uses of underscored node names developed\n\
    \   largely without coordination.  For TXT records, there is no\n   consistent,\
    \ internal syntax that permits distinguishing among the\n   different uses.  In\
    \ the case of the SRV RR and URI RR, distinguishing\n   among different types\
    \ of use was part of the design (see [RFC2782]\n   and [RFC7553]).  The SRV and\
    \ URI specifications serve as templates,\n   defining RRs that might only be used\
    \ for specific applications when\n   there is an additional specification.  The\
    \ template definition\n   included reference to two levels of tables of names\
    \ from which\n   underscored names should be drawn.  The lower-level (local scope)\
    \ set\n   of \"_service\" names is defined in terms of other IANA tables, namely\n\
    \   any table with symbolic names.  The upper-level (global scope) SRV\n   naming\
    \ field is \"_proto\", although its pool of names is not\n   explicitly defined.\n\
    \   The aggregate effect of these independent efforts was a long list of\n   underscored\
    \ names that were reserved without coordination, which\n   invites an eventual\
    \ name-assignment collision.  The remedy is this\n   base document and a companion\
    \ document ([RFC8553]), which define a\n   registry for these names and attempt\
    \ to register all those already in\n   use as well as to direct changes to the\
    \ pre-registry specifications\n   that used global underscored node names.\n"
- title: 2.  "Underscored and Globally Scoped DNS Node Names" Registry
  contents:
  - "2.  \"Underscored and Globally Scoped DNS Node Names\" Registry\n   A registry\
    \ for global DNS node names that begin with an underscore is\n   defined here.\
    \  The purpose of the \"Underscored and Globally Scoped\n   DNS Node Names\" registry\
    \ is to avoid collisions resulting from the\n   use of the same underscored name\
    \ for different applications.\n      If a public specification calls for use of\
    \ an underscored node\n      name, the global underscored node name -- the underscored\
    \ name\n      that is closest to the DNS root -- MUST be entered into this\n \
    \     registry.\n   An underscored name defines the scope of use for specific\
    \ resource\n   record types, which are associated with the domain name that is\
    \ the\n   \"parent\" to the branch defined by the underscored name.  A given name\n\
    \   defines a specific, constrained context for one or more RR TYPEs,\n   where\
    \ use of such record types conforms to the defined constraints.\n   o  Within\
    \ a leaf that is underscore scoped, other RRsets that are not\n      specified\
    \ as part of the scope MAY be used.\n   Structurally, the registry is defined\
    \ as a single, flat table of RR\n   TYPEs, under node names beginning with underscore.\
    \  In some cases,\n   such as for use of an SRV record, the full scoping name\
    \ might be\n   multi-part, as a sequence of underscored names.  Semantically,\
    \ that\n   sequence represents a hierarchical model, and it is theoretically\n\
    \   reasonable to allow reuse of a subordinate underscored name in a\n   different,\
    \ global underscored context; that is, a subordinate name is\n   meaningful only\
    \ within the scope of the global underscored node name.\n   Therefore, they are\
    \ ignored by this \"Underscored and Globally Scoped\n   DNS Node Names\" registry.\

    \ of that definition is separate from the expert review\n      required here.\n\
    \   The review is for the purposes of ensuring that:\n   o  The details for creating\
    \ the registry entry are sufficiently\n      clear, precise, and complete\n  \
    \ o  The combination of the underscored name, under which the listed\n      resource\
    \ record type is used, and the resource record type is\n      unique in the table\n\
