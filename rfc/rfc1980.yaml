  - "Abstract\n   The markup language known as \"HTML/2.0\" provides for image maps.\n\
    \   Image maps are document elements which allow clicking different areas\n  \
    \ of an image to reference different network resources, as specified by\n   Uniform\
    \ Identifier (URIs).  The image map capability in HTML/2.0 is\n   limited in several\
    \ ways, such as the restriction that it only works\n   with documents served via\
    \ the \"HTTP\" protocol, and the lack of a\n   viable fallback for users of text-only\
    \ browsers.  This document\n   specifies an extension to the HTML language, referred\
    \ to as \"Client-\n   Side Image Maps,\" which resolves these limitations.\n"

- title: 1.1  Purpose
  contents:
  - "1.1  Purpose\n   Image maps are an important feature of the point-and-click interface\n\
    \   which makes the World Wide Web so popular. The most common use of\n   image\
    \ maps is to allow users to access different documents by\n   clicking different\
    \ areas in an image.\n   There are several limitations of the current image map\
    \ implementation\n   as it applies to this use. First, it only works over the\
    \ HTTP\n   protocol, making it unusable for reading local files or files\n   accessed\
    \ via alternate protocols. Second, a server transaction is\n   required merely\
    \ to determine where the link is directed. This can\n   degrade performance noticeably\
    \ when accessing distant sites. Third,\n   unlike for normal links, there is no\
    \ way for a browser to provide\n   visual feedback to the user showing where a\
    \ portion of an image map\n   leads before the user actually clicks it. Lastly,\
    \ the method for\n   specifying the active regions of image maps is server-dependent,\n\
    \   compromising portability of documents.  This extension to support\n   client-side\
    \ image maps addresses these issues.\n   It is proposed that this extension be\
    \ included in a future revision\n   of the HTML specification.\n"
- title: 1.2  Overall Operation
  contents:
  - "1.2  Overall Operation\n   Client-side image maps work by placing a complete\
    \ representation of\n   the active areas of an image, including their shape, size,\
    \ and\n   destination (URI), into an SGML-compliant textual form.  This markup\n\
    \   may also optionally include a textual description for each area for\n   display\
    \ on non-textual browsers.  This representation, or \"map,\" is\n   given a name\
    \ to identify it.\n   When an image is included in an HTML document, it may include\
    \ an\n   attribute specifying a map to use.  The map may be contained in the\n\
    \   same file which references the image, but this it not required.  If\n   the\
    \ map is in a different file, a URI to that file must be provided.\n   The browser\
    \ will parse the map and remember the contents.  When the\n   user clicks the\
    \ map, the browser will match up the location with the\n   specified destination\
    \ for that location and access that URI.  In the\n   case of a non-graphical browser,\
    \ the browser could display the\n   textual descriptions for each area instead\
    \ of the image.  Clicking a\n   given textual description would then go to the\
    \ associated\n   destination.\n"

- title: 2.1 Syntax
  contents:
  - "2.1 Syntax\n   Adding a USEMAP attribute to an IMG element indicates that it\
    \ is a\n   client-side image map.  The USEMAP attribute can be used with the\n\
    \   ISMAP attribute to indicate that the image can be processed as either\n  \
    \ a client-side or server-side image map.  The argument to USEMAP\n   specifies\
    \ which map to use with the image, by specifying the URI for\n   the file containing\
    \ the map, followed by a '#', followed by the name\n   of the map.  If the argument\
    \ to USEMAP starts with a '#', the map is\n   assumed to be in the same document\
    \ as the IMG tag.  The presence of a\n   USEMAP attribute overrides the effect\
    \ of an enclosing anchor (A)\n   element.\n   The different regions of the image\
    \ are described using a MAP element.\n   The map describes each region in the\
    \ image and indicates where it\n   links to. The basic format for the MAP element\
    \ is as follows:\n   <MAP NAME=\"name\">\n   <AREA [SHAPE=\"shape\"] COORDS=\"\
    x,y,...\" [HREF=\"reference\"]\n         [NOHREF] [ALT=\"alt\"]>\n   </MAP>\n\
    \   The NAME attribute specifies the name of the map so that it can be\n   referenced\
    \ by an IMG element.  Each AREA element contained inside the\n   map element specifies\
    \ a single clickable area of the image.  The\n   SHAPE attribute gives the shape\
    \ of this area.  Possible shapes are\n   \"RECT\", \"CIRCLE\", and \"POLYGON\"\
    , which specify rectangular, circular,\n   and polygonal regions respectively.\
    \  If the SHAPE tag is omitted,\n   SHAPE=\"RECT\" is assumed.\n   The COORDS\
    \ tag describes the position of an area, using image pixels\n   as the units with\
    \ the origin at the upper-left corner of the image.\n   For a rectangle, the coordinates\
    \ are given as\n   \"left,top,right,bottom\".  The rectangular region defined\
    \ includes the\n   lower-right corner specified, i.e. to specify the entire area\
    \ of a\n   100x100 image, the coordinates would be \"0,0,99,99\".\n   For a circular\
    \ region, the coordinates are given as\n   \"center_x,center_y,radius\", specifying\
    \ the center and radius of the\n   ircle.  All points up to and including those\
    \ at a distance of\n   \"radius\" points from the center are included.  For example,\
    \ the\n   coordinates \"4,4,2\" would specify a circle which included the\n  \
    \ coordinates (2,4) (6,4) (4,2) and (4,6).\n   For a polygonal region, the coordinates\
    \ specify successive vertices\n   of the region in the format \"x1,y1,x2,y2,...,xn,yn\"\
    .  If the first\n   and last coordinates are not the same then a segment is inferred\
    \ to\n   close the polygon.  The region includes the boundary lines of the\n \
    \  polygon.  For example, \"20,20,30,40,10,40\" would specify a triangle\n   with\
    \ vertices at (20,20) (30,40) and (10,40).  No explicit limit is\n   placed on\
    \ the number of vertices, but a practical limit is imposed by\n   the fact that\
    \ HTML limits an attribute value to 1024 characters.\n   The NOHREF attribute\
    \ indicates that clicks in this region should\n   perform no action.  An HREF\
    \ attribute specifies where a click in that\n   area should lead.  A relative\
    \ anchor specification will be expanded\n   using the URI of the map description\
    \ as a base, rather than using the\n   URI of the document from which the map\
    \ description is referenced. If\n   a BASE tag is present in the document containing\
    \ the map description,\n   that URI will be used as the base.\n   An arbitrary\
    \ number of AREA tags may be specified.  If two areas\n   intersect, the one which\
    \ appears first in the map definition takes\n   precedence in the overlapping\
    \ region.  Multiple areas may share the\n   same destination to create composite\
    \ shapes.  Any portion of an image\n   which is not described by an AREA tag defaults\
    \ to having no action.\n   The ALT attribute specifies optional text which describes\
    \ a given\n   area.  A text-only browser can display the textual contents for\
    \ each\n   area as a substitute for the image.\n"

- title: 2.3  Backwards Compatibility
  contents:
  - "2.3  Backwards Compatibility\n   This extension is specifically designed to provide\
    \ a variety of\n   fallback options for browsers which do not support it.  These\
    \ options\n   are based on the assumption that browsers will ignore any attributes\n\
    \   or elements which are not present in the HTML/2.0 DTD.\n   An document can\
    \ be written so that a client-side image map can have\n   three different fallback\
    \ behaviors.  First, the document can use the\n   server-side image map capability,\
    \ by specifying the ISMAP attribute\n   as well as USEMAP.  In situations where\
    \ this is possible, the image\n   map will work whether or not the browser supports\
    \ the client-side\n   extension.\n   Second, clicking the image can direct the\
    \ user to a single URI,\n   regardless of where on the image he clicks.  This\
    \ is accomplished by\n   placing the image inside an anchor (A) element.  The\
    \ fallback\n   destination could provide the user with an error or a textual list\
    \ of\n   destinations.\n   Lastly, the image can appear to not be a link at all\
    \ (i.e. missing\n   whatever visual cues a browser provides to indicate a hyperlink).\n\
    \   This will be the result if the image element neither contains an\n   ISMAP\
    \ attribute nor is inside an anchor.\n"
