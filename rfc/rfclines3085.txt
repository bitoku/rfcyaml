Abstract This document describes a URN (Uniform Resource Name) namespace for identifying NewsML NewsItems.
A NewsItem is an information resource that is expressible as a NewsML element within a NewsML document conforming to the NewsML Document Type Declaration (DTD) as defined by the International Press Telecommunications Council (IPTC).
Introduction NewsML is an XML format for packaging multimedia news resources.
It has been created under the auspices of the International Press Telecommunications Council (IPTC), and version 1.0 was approved by the IPTC on 6 October 2000.
The same logical NewsItem may exist in multiple physical locations.
The NewsML specification allows NewsItems to have multiple URLs, but only a single URN.
It is the latter which then uniquely names the resource.
This namespace specification is for a formal namespace.
Specification Template Namespace ID: "newsml" requested.
Registration Version Number: 1 Registration Date: 2000 11 07
Declared registrant of the namespace:
string RevisionId   posint Update   0
The ProviderId must be an Internet domain name, and must be owned by the organisation creating the NewsML resource and allocating the URN to it, at the date identified by the DateId.
DateId is a date in ISO 8601 Basic Format (CCYYMMDD), and must correspond to a date at which the organisation allocating the URN owned the domain name specified in the ProviderId.
The NewsItemId must be unique among all NewsItems emanating from the same provider and having the same DateId.
RevisionId is a positive integer indicating which revision of a given NewsItem this is.
Any positive integer may be used, but it must always be the case that of two instances of a NewsItem that have the same ProviderId, DateId and NewsItemId, the one whose RevisionId has the larger value must be the more recent revision.
A RevisionId of 0 is not permitted.
If the NewsItem contains an "Update" element or elements, then Update must be set to "U".
If the NewsItem consists only of a replacement set of NewsManagement data, then Update must be set to "A".
If neither of these is the case, then Update must be suppressed.
None Identifier uniqueness considerations: The combination of ProviderId and DateId serves to uniquely identify the organisation that is allocating the URN.
That organisation is responsible for ensuring the uniqueness of the DateId/NewsItemId/RevisionId combination.
Identifier persistence considerations: A NewsML URN may only be allocated by an organisation that owns an Internet domain name.
The URN identifies a date on which the organisation owned that domain name.
The combination of date and domain name will serve to uniquely identify that organisation for all time.
Process of identifier assignment: The organisation identified by the ProviderId/DateId combination is responsible for allocating a NewsItemId that is unique among all those that it allocates with that DateId.
NewsML providers are responsible for the provision of a URN resolution service, if any, for NewsML URNs
they have assigned with a valid ProviderId/DateId combination.
Rules for Lexical Equivalence: URNs are lexically equivalent if the ProviderId, DateId, NewsItemId, and RevisionId are all identical (case insensitive comparison).
Conformance with URN Syntax: No special considerations beyond the syntax herein described.
Organisations that allocate NewsML URNs are responsible for the provision of a URN validation service, if any, for URNs they have assigned with a valid ProviderId/DateId combination.
The following examples are representative of NewsML URNs, but may not refer to actual resources.

There are no additional security considerations other than those normally associated with the use and resolution of URNs in general.
