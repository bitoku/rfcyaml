- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   This MIB module will be used to configure and/or look at\
    \ the\n   configuration of user identities and their credential information.\n\
    \   For the purposes of this MIB module, a \"user\" identity does not need\n \
    \  to be an actual person; a user can also be a host, an application, a\n   cluster\
    \ of hosts, or any other identifiable entity that can be\n   authorized to access\
    \ a resource.\n   Most objects in this MIB module have a MAX-ACCESS of read-create;\n\
    \   this module is intended to allow configuration of user identities and\n  \
    \ their names, addresses, and credentials.  MIN-ACCESS for all objects\n   is\
    \ read-only for those implementations that configure through other\n   means,\
    \ but require the ability to monitor user identities.\n"

- title: 3.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework
  contents:
  - "3.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework\n   For a detailed overview of\
    \ the documents that describe the current\n   Internet-Standard Management Framework,\
    \ please refer to section 7 of\n   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].\n   Managed objects are\
    \ accessed via a virtual information store, termed\n   the Management Information\
    \ Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally\n   accessed through the Simple Network\
    \ Management Protocol (SNMP).\n   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms\
    \ defined in the\n   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies\
    \ a MIB\n   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,\n\
    \   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580\n   [RFC2580].\n"
- title: 4.  Relationship to Other MIB Modules
  contents:
  - "4.  Relationship to Other MIB Modules\n   The IPS-AUTH-MIB module does not directly\
    \ address objects within\n   other modules.  The identity address objects contain\
    \ IPv4, IPv6, or\n   other address types, and as such they may be indirectly related\
    \ to\n   objects within the IP [RFC4293] MIB module.\n   This MIB module does\
    \ not provide actual authorization or access\n   control lists; it provides a\
    \ means to identify entities that can be\n   included in other authorization lists.\
    \  This should generally be done\n   in MIB modules that reference identities\
    \ in this one.  It also does\n   not cover login or authentication failure statistics\
    \ or\n   notifications, as these are all fairly application specific and are\n\
    \   not generic enough to be included here.\n   The user identity objects within\
    \ this module are typically referenced\n   from other modules by a RowPointer\
    \ within that module.  A module\n   containing resources for which it requires\
    \ a list of authorized user\n   identities may create such a list, with a single\
    \ RowPointer within\n   each list element pointing to a user identity within this\
    \ module.\n   This is neither required nor restricted by this MIB module.\n"
- title: 5.  Relationship to the USM MIB Module
  contents:
  - "5.  Relationship to the USM MIB Module\n   The User-based Security Model (USM)\
    \ [RFC3414] also defines the\n   concept of a user, defining authentication and\
    \ privacy protocols and\n   their credentials.  The definition of USM includes\
    \ the SNMP-USER-\n   BASED-SM-MIB module allows configuration of SNMPv3 user credentials\n\
    \   to protect SNMPv3 messages.  Although USM's users are not related to\n   the\
    \ user identities managed by the IPS-AUTH-MIB module defined in\n   this document,\
    \ USM will often be implemented on the same system as\n   the IPS-AUTH-MIB module,\
    \ with the SNMP-USER-BASED-SM-MIB module used\n   to manage the security protecting\
    \ SNMPv3 messages, including those\n   that access the IPS-AUTH-MIB module.\n\
    \   The term \"user\" in this document is distinct from an SNMPv3 user and\n \
    \  is intended to include, but is not limited to, users of IP storage\n   devices.\
    \  A \"user\" in this document is a collection of user names\n   (unique identifiers),\
    \ user addresses, and credentials that can be\n   used together to determine whether\
    \ an entity should be allowed access\n   to a resource.  Each user can have multiple\
    \ names, addresses, and\n   credentials.  As a result, this MIB module is particularly\
    \ suited to\n   managing users of storage resources, which are typically given\
    \ access\n   control lists consisting of potentially multiple identifiers,\n \
    \  addresses, and credentials.  This MIB module provides for\n   authorization\
    \ lists only and does not include setting of data privacy\n   parameters.\n  \
    \ In contrast, an SNMPv3 user as defined in [RFC3414] has exactly one\n   user-name,\
    \ one authentication protocol, and one privacy protocol,\n   along with their\
    \ associated information and SNMP-specific\n   information, such as an engine\
    \ ID.  These objects are defined to\n   support exactly the information needed\
    \ for SNMPv3 security.\n   For the remainder of this document, the term \"user\"\
    \ means an IPS-\n   AUTH-MIB user identity.\n"
- title: 6.  Relationship to SNMP Contexts
  contents:
  - "6.  Relationship to SNMP Contexts\n   Each non-scalar object in the IPS-AUTH-MIB\
    \ module is indexed first by\n   an instance.  Each instance is a collection of\
    \ identities that can be\n   used to authorize access to a resource.  The use\
    \ of an instance works\n   well with partitionable or hierarchical devices and\
    \ fits in logically\n   with other management schemes.  Instances do not replace\
    \ SNMP\n   contexts; however, they do provide a very simple way to assign a\n\
    \   collection of identities within a device to one or more SNMP\n   contexts,\
    \ without having to do so for each identity's row.\n"
- title: 7.  Discussion
  contents:
  - "7.  Discussion\n   This MIB module structure is intended to allow the configuration\
    \ of a\n   list of user identities, each with a list of names, addresses,\n  \
    \ credentials, and certificates that, when combined, will distinguish\n   that\
    \ identity.\n   The IPS-AUTH-MIB module is structured around two primary \"objects\"\
    ,\n   the authorization instance and the identity, which serve as\n   containers\
    \ for the remainder of the objects.  This section contains a\n   brief description\
    \ of the \"object\" hierarchy and a description of each\n   object, followed by\
    \ a discussion of the actual SNMP table structure\n   within the objects.\n"
- title: 7.1.  Authorization MIB Object Model
  contents:
  - "7.1.  Authorization MIB Object Model\n   The top-level object in this structure\
    \ is the authorization instance,\n   which \"contains\" all of the other objects.\
    \  The indexing hierarchy of\n   this module looks like:\n   ipsAuthInstance\n\
    \      -- A distinct authorization entity within the managed system.\n      --\
    \ Most implementations will have just one of these.\n      ipsAuthIdentity\n \
    \        -- A user identity, consisting of a set of identity names,\n        \
    \ -- addresses, and credentials reflected in the following\n         -- objects:\n\
    \         ipsAuthIdentityName\n            -- A name for a user identity.  A name\
    \ should be globally\n            -- unique, and unchanging over time.  Some protocols\
    \ may\n            -- not require this one.\n         ipsAuthIdentityAddress\n\
    \            -- An address range, typically but not necessarily an\n         \
    \   -- IPv4, IPv6, or Fibre Channel address range, at which\n            -- the\
    \ identity is allowed to reside.\n         ipsAuthCredential\n            -- A\
    \ single credential, such as a CHAP username,\n            -- which can be used\
    \ to verify the identity.\n            ipsAuthCredChap\n               -- CHAP-specific\
    \ attributes for an ipsAuthCredential\n            ipsAuthCredSrp\n          \
    \     -- SRP-specific attributes\n            ipsAuthCredKerberos\n          \
    \     -- Kerberos-specific attributes\n   Each identity contains the information\
    \ necessary to identify a\n   particular end-point that wishes to access a service,\
    \ such as iSCSI.\n   An identity can contain multiple names, addresses, and credentials.\n\
    \   Each of these names, addresses, and credentials exists in its own\n   row.\
    \  If multiple rows of one of these three types are present, they\n   are treated\
    \ in an \"OR\" fashion; an entity to be authorized need only\n   match one of\
    \ the rows.  If rows of different types are present (e.g.,\n   a name and an address),\
    \ these are treated in an \"AND\" fashion; an\n   entity to be authorized must\
    \ match at least one row from each\n   category.  If there are no rows present\
    \ of a category, this category\n   is ignored.\n   For example, if an ipsAuthIdentity\
    \ contains two rows of\n   ipsAuthIdentityAddress, one row of ipsAuthCredential,\
    \ and no rows of\n   ipsAuthIdentityName, an entity must match the Credential\
    \ row and at\n   least one of the two Address rows to match the identity.\n  \
    \ Index values such as ipsAuthInstIndex and ipsAuthIdentIndex are\n   referenced\
    \ in multiple tables, and rows can be added and deleted.  An\n   implementation\
    \ should therefore attempt to keep all index values\n   persistent across reboots;\
    \ index values for rows that have been\n   deleted must not be reused before a\
    \ reboot.\n"
- title: 7.2.  ipsAuthInstance
  contents:
  - "7.2.  ipsAuthInstance\n   The ipsAuthInstanceAttributesTable is the primary table\
    \ of the IPS-\n   AUTH-MIB module.  Every other table entry in this module includes\
    \ the\n   index of an ipsAuthInstanceAttributesEntry as its primary index.  An\n\
    \   authorization instance is basically a managed set of identities.\n   Many\
    \ implementations will include just one authorization instance row\n   in this\
    \ table.  However, there will be cases where multiple rows in\n   this table may\
    \ be used:\n      - A large system may be \"partitioned\" into multiple, distinct\n\
    \        virtual systems, perhaps sharing the SNMP agent but not their\n     \
    \   lists of identities.  Each virtual system would have its own\n        authorization\
    \ instance.\n      - A set of stackable systems, each with its own set of identities,\n\
    \        may be represented by a common SNMP agent.  Each individual\n       \
    \ system would have its own authorization instance.\n      - Multiple protocols,\
    \ each with its own set of identities, may\n        exist within a single system\
    \ and be represented by a single SNMP\n        agent.  In this case, each protocol\
    \ may have its own\n        authorization instance.\n   An entry in this table\
    \ is often referenced by its name\n   (ipsAuthInstDescr), which should be displayed\
    \ to the user by the\n   management station.  When an implementation supports\
    \ only one entry\n   in this table, the description may be returned as a zero-length\n\
    \   string.\n"

    \ a particular\n   identity in the authIdentity table.\n   Implementations making\
    \ use of the IPS-AUTH-MIB module may identify\n   their resources by names, addresses,\
    \ or both.  A name is typically a\n   unique (within the required scope), unchanging\
    \ identifier for a\n   resource.  It will normally meet some or all of the requirements\
    \ for\n   a Uniform Resource Name [RFC1737], although a name in the context of\n\
    \   this MIB module does not need to be a URN.  Identifiers that\n   typically\
    \ change over time should generally be placed into the\n   ipsAuthIdentityAddress\
    \ table; names that have no uniqueness\n   properties should usually be placed\
    \ into the description attribute\n   for the identity.\n   An example of an identity\

    \      \"IP Storage requires the use of address information\n           that uses\
    \ not only the InetAddress type defined in the\n           INET-ADDRESS-MIB, but\
    \ also Fibre Channel type defined\n           in the Fibre Channel Management\
    \ MIB.  Although these\n           address types are recognized in the IANA Address\
    \ Family\n           Numbers MIB, the addressing mechanisms have not been\n  \
    \         merged into a well-known, common type.  This data type,\n          \
    \ the IpsAuthAddress, performs the merging for this MIB\n           module.\n\
    \           The formats of objects of this type are determined by\n          \
    \ a corresponding object with syntax AddressFamilyNumbers,\n           and thus\
    \ every object defined using this TC must\n           identify the object with\
    \ syntax AddressFamilyNumbers\n           that specifies its type.\n         \
    \  The syntax and semantics of this object depend on the\n           identified\

    \    rows permanent, or permanent rows temporary;\n   Note that removal of legitimate\
    \ credentials can result in either\n   denial of service or weakening the requirements\
    \ for access of a\n   particular service.  Note also that some types of credentials,\
    \ such\n   as CHAP or SRP, also require passwords or verifiers to be associated\n\
    \   with the credential.  These are managed outside this MIB module.\n   Some\
    \ of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a\n   MAX-ACCESS\
    \ other than not-accessible) may be considered sensitive or\n   vulnerable in\
    \ some network environments.  It is thus important to\n   control even GET and/or\
    \ NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly\n   to even encrypt the values of\
    \ these objects when sending them over\n   the network via SNMP.  These are the\
    \ tables and objects and their\n   sensitivity/vulnerability:\n   o  All tables\
    \ (specifically: ipsAuthInstanceAttributesTable,\n      ipsAuthIdentAttributesTable,\
    \ ipsAuthIdentNameAttributesTable,\n      ipsAuthIdentAddrAttributesTable, ipsAuthCredentialAttributesTable,\n\
    \      ipsAuthCredChapAttributesTable, ipsAuthCredSrpAttributesTable, and\n  \
    \    ipsAuthCredKerbAttributesTable) provide the ability to find out\n      which\
    \ names, addresses, and credentials would be required to\n      access services\
    \ on the managed system.  If these credentials are\n      easily spoofed (particularly\
    \ the name or address), read access to\n      this MIB module must be tightly\
    \ controlled.  When used with\n      pointers from another MIB module to rows\
    \ in the\n      ipsAuthIdentAttributesTable, this MIB module provides information\n\
    \      about which entities are authorized to connect to which entities.\n   SNMP\
    \ versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.\n   Even if the\
    \ network itself is secure (for example by using IPsec),\n   even then, there\
    \ is no control as to who on the secure network is\n   allowed to access and GET/SET\
    \ (read/change/create/delete) the objects\n   in this MIB module.\n   It is RECOMMENDED\
    \ that implementors consider the security features as\n   provided by the SNMPv3\
    \ framework (see [RFC3410], section 8),\n   including full support for the SNMPv3\
    \ cryptographic mechanisms (for\n   authentication and privacy).\n   Further,\
    \ deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT\n   RECOMMENDED.  Instead,\
    \ it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to\n   enable cryptographic security.\
    \  It is then a customer/operator\n   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity\
    \ giving access to an\n   instance of this MIB module is properly configured to\
    \ give access to\n   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate\n\
    \   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.\n   In many implementations,\
    \ the objects in this MIB module can be read\n   and modified via other mechanisms\
    \ or protocols in addition to this\n   MIB module.  For the system to be secure,\
    \ other mechanisms that can\n   read and modify the contents of this MIB module\
    \ must also address the\n   above issues, and handle the threats outlined in [RFC3411],\
    \ section\n   1.4.\n   Given the sensitivity of information contained in this\
    \ MIB module, it\n   is strongly recommended that encryption (SNMPv3 with a securityLevel\n\
    \   of authPriv [RFC3411]) be used for all access to objects in this MIB\n   module.\n"
- title: 9.2.  Other Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "9.2.  Other Security Considerations\n   An identity consists of a set of names\
    \ (e.g., an iSCSI Initiator\n   Name), addresses (e.g., an IP address or Fibre\
    \ Channel World Wide\n   Name (WWN)), and credentials (e.g., a CHAP user name).\n\
    \   To match an identity, one must match:\n   o  One of the IdentNames belonging\
    \ to the IdentIndex, unless there\n      are no IdentNames for the IdentIndex,\
    \ and\n   o  One of the IdentAddrs belonging to the IdentIndex, unless there\n\
    \      are no IdentAddrs for the IdentIndex, and\n   o  One of the IdentCreds\
    \ belonging to the IdentIndex, unless there\n      are no Creds for the IdentIndex.\n\
    \   Note that if any of the above lists are empty for a given IdentIndex,\n  \
    \ any identifier of that type is considered to match the identity.  The\n   non-empty\
    \ lists will still be checked.  For example, if the\n   IdentAddrs list is empty\
    \ for the IndentIndex, but there are entries\n   in IdentNames and IdentCreds,\
    \ any address will be considered a match,\n   as long as the offered name and\
    \ credential match one of the\n   IdentNames and IdentCreds, respectively.\n \
    \  This leaves a possible security window while adding and removing\n   entries\
    \ from one of these lists.  For example, an identity could\n   consist of no IdentNames,\
    \ no IdentAddrs, and exactly one IdentCred.\n   If that IdentCred was to be updated,\
    \ several methods could be used:\n   o  The UserName or Principal could be simply\
    \ written in the\n      appropriate table, if the credential's type remained the\
    \ same\n      (recommended).\n   o  The new credential could be added, then the\
    \ old deleted\n      (recommended).\n   o  The new credential could be added,\
    \ and the old deleted in the same\n      SNMP request (recommended, but do the\
    \ add first).\n   o  The old credential could be deleted, then the new added (Don't\n\
    \      use!).\n   Of the above methods, the last leaves a window in which the\
    \ list is\n   empty, possibly allowing unconstrained access to the resource making\n\
    \   use of this MIB.  This method should never be used for Names, Addrs,\n   or\
    \ Creds.\n   The use of the third method, adding and deleting within the same\n\
    \   request, should be used with care.  It is recommended that within the\n  \
    \ request, the add be done first.  Otherwise, an implementation may\n   attempt\
    \ to perform these operations in order, potentially leaving a\n   window.\n  \
    \ The first two methods are recommended.\n   Care must also be taken when updating\
    \ the IdentAddrs for an identity.\n   Each IdentAddr specifies a range of addresses\
    \ that match the\n   identity, and has an address type, starting address, and\
    \ ending\n   address.  Modifying these one at a time can open a temporary window\n\
    \   where a larger range of addresses are allowed.  For example, a single\n  \
    \ address is specified using IdentAddrType = ipv4, IdentAddrStart =\n   IdentAddrEnd\
    \ = 192.0.2.5.  We want to update this to specify the\n   single address 192.0.2.34.\
    \  If the end address is updated first, we\n   temporarily allow the range 192.0.2.5\
    \ .. 192.0.2.34, which is not\n   what we want.  Similarly, if we change from\
    \ 192.0.2.34 back to\n   192.0.2.5, and we update IdentAddrStart first, we end\
    \ up with the\n   range again.  To handle this, an application must either:\n\
    \   o  update both IdentAddrStart and IdentAddrEnd in the same SNMP set\n    \
    \  request, or\n   o  add the new IdentAddrStart and IdentAddrEnd with a new\n\
    \      IdentAddrIndex, then delete the old one, using the methods shown\n    \
    \  before.\n   Since the value of IdentAddrType specifies the formats of\n   IdentAddrStart\
    \ and IdentAddrEnd, modification of IdentAddrType is not\n   allowed for an existing\
    \ row.\n"
