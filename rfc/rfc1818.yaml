  contents:
  - "Abstract\n   This document describes a new series of documents which describe\
    \ best\n   current practices for the Internet community.  Documents in this\n\
    \   series carry the endorsement of the Internet Engineering Steering\n   Group\
    \ (IESG).\n"
- title: Discussion
  contents:
  - "Discussion\n   The current IETF process has two types of RFCs: standards track\n\
    \   documents and other RFCs (e.g., informational, experimental, FYIs)\n   [1].\
    \  The intent of the standards track documents is clear, and\n   culminates in\
    \ an official Internet Standard [2,3].  Informational\n   RFCs can be published\
    \ on a less formal basis, subject to the\n   reasonable constraints of the RFC\
    \ editor.  Informational RFCs are not\n   subject to peer review and carry no\
    \ significance whatsoever within\n   the IETF process [4].\n   The IETF currently\
    \ has no other mechanism or means of publishing\n   relevant technical information\
    \ which it endorses.  This document\n   creates a new subseries of RFCs, entitled\
    \ Best Current Practices\n   BCPs).\n   The BCP process is similar to that for\
    \ proposed standards.  The BCP\n   is submitted to the IESG for review, and the\
    \ existing review process\n   applies, including a \"last call\" on the IETF announcement\
    \ mailing\n   list.  However, once the IESG has approved the document, the process\n\
    \   ends and the document is published.  The resulting document is viewed\n  \
    \ as having the technical approval of the IETF, but it is not, and\n   cannot\
    \ become an official Internet Standard.\n   Possible examples of technical information\
    \ to which BCPs could be\n   applied are \"OSI NSAP Allocation\" [5], and \"OSPF\
    \ Applicability\n   Statement\" [6].\n"
