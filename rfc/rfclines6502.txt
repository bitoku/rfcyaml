Abstract This document specifies the notification mechanism for XCON (centralized conferencing).
This mechanism reuses the SIP (Session Initiation Protocol)
event package for conference state.
Additionally, the notification mechanism includes support for the XCON data model and for partial notifications.
framework [RFC5239] defines a notification service that provides updates about a conference instance's state to authorized parties using a notification protocol, as shown in Figure 1.
This document specifies how to use the SIP (Session Initiation Protocol [RFC3261])
event package for conference state defined in [RFC4575] as a notification protocol between a client and a conference's notification server.
In addition to specifying the SIP event package for conference state, [RFC4575] specifies a data format to be used with the event package.
The XCON data model [RFC6501] extends that format with new elements and attributes so that the extended format supports more functionality (e.g., floor control).
The notification protocol specified in this document supports all the data defined in the XCON data model (i.e., the data originally defined in [RFC4575] plus all the extensions defined in [RFC6501]) plus a partial notification mechanism based on XML patch operations [RFC5261].
The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].
In order to obtain notifications from a conference server's notification service, a client subscribes to the 'conference' event package at the server as specified in [RFC4575].
Per [RFC4575], NOTIFY requests within this event package can carry an XML document in the "application/conference info xml" format.
Additionally, per this specification, NOTIFY requests can also carry XML documents in the "application/xcon conference info xml" and the "application/ xcon conference info diff xml" formats.
A document in the "application/xcon conference info xml" format provides the user agent with the whole state of a conference instance.
A document in the "application/ xcon conference info diff xml" format provides the user agent with the changes the state of the conference instance has experienced since the last notification sent to the user agent.
Full Notifications Subscribers signal support for full notifications by including the "application/xcon conference info xml" format in the Accept header field of the SUBSCRIBE requests they generate.
If a client subscribing to the 'conference' event package generates an Accept header field that includes the MIME type "application/ xcon conference info xml", the server has the option of returning documents that follow the XML format specified in [RFC6501] and are carried in "application/xcon conference info xml" message bodies.
Backwards Compatibility Conference servers that implement the SIP event package for conference state and support the "application/ xcon conference info xml" MIME type MUST also support the "application/conference info xml" MIME type.
This way, legacy clients, which only support "application/conference info xml", are able to receive notifications in a format they understand.
Clients that implement the SIP event package for conference state and support the "application/xcon conference info xml" MIME type SHOULD also support the "application/conference info xml" MIME type.
This way, these clients are able to receive notifications from legacy servers, which only support "application/conference info xml", in a format they understand.
The conference state reported by this event package may contain many elements.
When the "xcon conference info xml" format is used and there is a change in the state of an element, the server generates a notification with the whole conference state.
Generating large notifications to report small changes does not meet the efficiency requirements of some bandwidth constrained environments.
The partial notifications mechanism specified in this section is a more efficient way to report changes in the conference state.
The SIP event package for conference state defined a partial notification mechanism based on <state> elements.
Servers compliant with this specification
MUST NOT use that partial notification mechanism.
Instead, they MUST use the mechanism specified in this section.
Subscribers signal support for partial notifications by including the "application/xcon conference info diff xml" format in the Accept header field of the SUBSCRIBE requests they generate.
If a client subscribing to the 'conference' event package generates an Accept header field that includes the MIME type "application/ xcon conference info diff xml", the server has the option of returning documents that follow the XML format specified in Section 5.4 and are carried in "application/ xcon conference diff info xml" message bodies.
Once a subscription is accepted and installed, the server MUST deliver full state in its first notification.
To report full state, the server MUST set the Content Type header field to the value "application/xcon conference info xml".
In order to deliver a partial notification, the server MUST set the Content Type header field to the value "application/ xcon conference info diff xml".
When the server generates a partial notification, the server SHOULD only include the information that has changed compared to the previous notification.
It is up to the server's local policy to determine what is considered as a change to the previous state.
The server MUST construct partial notifications according to the following logic: all the information that has been added to the document is listed inside <add> elements.
All information that has been removed from the document is listed inside <remove> elements, and all information that has been changed is listed under <replace> elements.
The server MUST NOT send a new NOTIFY request with a partial notification until it has received a final response from the subscriber for the previous one or the previous NOTIFY request has timed out.
When the server receives a SUBSCRIBE request (refresh or termination) within the associated subscription, it SHOULD send a NOTIFY request containing the full document using the 'application/ xcon conference info xml' content type.
If the server has used a content type other than 'application/ xcon conference info xml' in notifications within the existing subscription and changes to deliver partial notifications, the server MUST deliver full state using the 'application/ xcon conference info xml' content type before generating its first partial notification.
Processing of Partial Notifications When a subscriber receives the first notification containing full state in a 'application/xcon conference info xml' MIME body, the subscriber MUST store the received full document as its local copy.
When the subscriber receives a subsequent notification, the subscriber MUST modify its locally stored information according to the following logic:  If the notification carries an 'application/ xcon conference info xml' document, the subscriber MUST replace its local copy of the document with the document received in the notification.
If the notification carries an 'application/ xcon conference info diff xml' document, the subscriber MUST apply the changes indicated in the received 'application/ xcon conference info diff xml' document to its local copy of the full document.
If the subscriber encounters a processing error while processing an 'application/xcon conference info diff xml' encoded document, the subscriber SHOULD renew its subscription.
A subscriber can fall back to normal operations by not including the "application/ xcon conference info diff xml" format in a new SUBSCRIBE request.
If the server changes the content type used in notifications within the existing subscription, the subscriber MUST discard all the previously received information and process the new content as specified for that content type.
An xcon conference info diff document is an XML [W3C.REC xml 20081126] document that MUST be well formed and SHOULD be valid.
The namespace URI for the <conference info diff> root document element is defined in [RFC6501]
The root document element <conference info diff> has a single mandatory attribute, "entity".
The value of this attribute is the conference object identifier (XCON URI)
that identifies the conference being described in the document.
The content of the <conference info diff> element is an unordered sequence of <add>, <replace>, and <remove> elements followed by elements from other namespaces for the purposes of extensibility.
Any such unknown elements MUST be ignored by the client.
The <add>, <replace>, and <remove> elements can contain other extension attributes than what are defined in the corresponding base types of [RFC5261].
XML Schema for Partial Notifications
This is the XML schema for the "application/ xcon conference info diff xml" data format.
xml patch ops" schema is defined in [RFC5261].
xml version "1.0" encoding "UTF 8"?

This document specifies how to deliver notifications using the SIP event package for conference state in two new formats.
The fact that notifications are encoded in a different format does not have security implications.
Section 8 of [RFC4575] contains security considerations related to the use of the event package.
Implementers of the event package need to follow those considerations regardless of the format used to encode their notifications.
