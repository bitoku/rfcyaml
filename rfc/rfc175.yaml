  - "             Comments on \"Socket Conventions Reconsidered\"\n        We agree\
    \ with the conclusions reached by Abhay, Bob, and Joel in\n   RFC #167, \"Socket\
    \ Conventions Reconsidered,\" (see RFC #129, scheme #4)\n   -- especially the\
    \ necessity for a major NCP overhaul.\n        Our main departure in thinking\
    \ from RFC #167 concerns the socket\n   length. (See RFC #164, page 21.)  Since\
    \ there is an apparently serious\n   TIP storage consideration, Rand- assigned\
    \ sockets will have the\n   high-order 16 bits zero.\n        For the particular\
    \ programs (current and pending) that Rand must\n   access, repeatability of socket\
    \ name (RFC #167, page 3) is not\n   necessary for the user process and also not\
    \ necessary for the server\n   process except for initial contact (ICP) sockets.\n\
    \   Our current use of socket names is diagrammed below.\n    O           15 16\
