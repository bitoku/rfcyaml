- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   Multicast scopes are defined in [RFC4291].  [RFC7346] extends\
    \ the\n   scope definition with this text:\n   \"Interface-Local, Link-Local,\
    \ and Realm-Local scope boundaries are\n   automatically derived from physical\
    \ connectivity or other\n   non-multicast-related configurations.  Global scope\
    \ has no boundary.\n   The boundaries of all other non-reserved scopes of Admin-Local\
    \ or\n   larger are administratively configured.\"\n   The Admin-Local scope must\
    \ therefore be administratively configured.\n   In this document, \"administratively\
    \ configured\" does not imply\n   actions by a human beyond installing the protocol\
    \ specified herein.\n   \"Administratively configured\" means an automatic derivation\
    \ as\n   described in this document.\n   This document describes an automated\
    \ policy for the Multicast\n   Protocol for Low-Power and Lossy Networks (MPL)\
    \ [RFC7731] forwarding\n   of multicast messages with Admin-Local scope within\
    \ a border router\n   that lies between a network running MPL and some other network.\
    \  This\n   policy is in line with the autonomous networking ideas presented in\n\
    \   [RFC7576].\n   The Realm-Local multicast address is currently used by MPL\
    \ to\n   propagate the multicast message to all receivers and forwarders\n   within\
    \ a mesh network.  The multicast propagation is limited to a\n   mesh network\
    \ with a common Layer 2.  For example, a Low-Power\n   Wireless Personal Area\
    \ Network (LoWPAN) is defined by an\n   IEEE 802.15.4 Layer 2 mesh network, composed\
    \ of all connected nodes\n   sharing the same Personal Area Network (PAN) ID [RFC4944].\n\
    \   The network concept differs between mesh network technologies.  This\n   document\
    \ maps a general network identifier to the specific network\n   identifier of\
    \ existing mesh technologies.\n   In current and projected deployments, there\
    \ is a requirement to\n   propagate a multicast message beyond the boundaries\
    \ of the mesh\n   network in which it originated, independent of the mesh technology.\n\
    \   Consider the case where propagation over two mesh networks is\n   required.\
    \  In one example, each mesh network has a border router and\n   the two border\
    \ routers are connected with an Ethernet link.  In\n   another example, each mesh\
    \ network is connected to its own network\n   interface connected to the same\
    \ border router.  In both cases, an\n   Admin-Local multicast message originating\
    \ in one network needs to\n   propagate into the other mesh network.  The boundary\
    \ of the\n   Admin-Local scope is administratively configured.\n   This document\
    \ describes an \"MPL4 router\" that forwards MPL messages\n   with a multicast\
    \ address with Admin-Local scope to all interfaces\n   connected to links that\
    \ connect to other MPL-enabled interfaces.  The\n   MPL4 router enables all its\
    \ interfaces for MPL messages and allocates\n   an additional variable, MPL_BLOCKED,\
    \ that either permits or forbids\n   the forwarding of MPL messages.\n   The MPL4\
    \ router uses the following technique to establish over which\n   links MPL4 messages\
    \ must be forwarded: The MPL4 router listens on its\n   interfaces for the arrival\
    \ of MPL4 messages.  When MPL4 messages\n   arrive over an interface, the MPL4\
    \ router records this interface in\n   the set of interfaces over which incoming\
    \ MPL4 messages are\n   forwarded.  The MPL4 router regularly sends MPL4 messages\
    \ over its\n   interfaces to provoke the return of MPL4 messages to maintain the\
    \ set\n   of forwarding interfaces.\n   It is expected that the private network\
    \ of an organization, building,\n   or home is connected to the Internet via the\
    \ edge routers provided by\n   an ISP.  The intention is that MPL messages with\
    \ multicast addresses\n   of Admin-Local scope are freely forwarded within the\
    \ private network\n   but are never forwarded outside the private network by edge\
    \ routers.\n"

    \  MPL_TO: Integer that indicates the interval in which MPL messages\n      are\
    \ expected to be received, in seconds.\n"
- title: 3.2.  Determination of MPL4 Zone
  contents:
  - "3.2.  Determination of MPL4 Zone\n   All interfaces of the MPL4 router MUST be\
    \ associated with the\n   following MPL protocol parameters, as described in [RFC7731]:\n\
    \   PROACTIVE_FORWARDING, DATA_MESSAGE_IMIN, DATA_MESSAGE_IMAX,\n   DATA_MESSAGE_K,\
    \ and DATA_MESSAGE_TIMER_EXPIRATIONS.  Upon startup of\n   the MPL4 router, the\
    \ parameters associated with all interfaces are\n   assigned the following values:\
    \ PROACTIVE_FORWARDING = TRUE,\n   MPL_BLOCKED = false.  All interfaces MUST subscribe\
    \ to the multicast\n   addresses ALL_MPL_FORWARDERS scope 3 and scope 4.\n   The\
    \ MPL4 router executes the following algorithm for each interface:\n   o  With\
    \ a frequency determined by the value of MPL_CHECK_INT, the\n      MPL4 router\
    \ sends an MPL4 message on each interface with a header\n      that includes the\
    \ MPL Option [RFC7731]; the message is sent to\n      multicast address ALL_MPL_FORWARDERS\
    \ with scope 4.\n   o  When, within an interval determined by the value of MPL_TO\
    \ no MPL\n      message is received, the value of MPL_BLOCKED is set to TRUE.\n\
    \   o  On reception of an MPL4 message, the value of MPL_BLOCKED of the\n    \
    \  receiving interface is set to false.\n   This protocol leads to a state where\
    \ for each interface MPL_BLOCKED\n   is set to false if and only if MPL-enabled\
    \ interfaces are connected\n   to the link associated with the interface.  When\
    \ an MPL message is\n   submitted to an MPL-enabled interface called \"Interface\
    \ A\" in the MPL\n   router, the Trickle algorithm [RFC6206] is activated to send\
    \ the MPL\n   message.  The MPL4 message with multicast address ALL_MPL_FORWARDERS\n\
    \   scope 4 is accepted by every interface connected to the link that has\n  \
    \ subscribed to ALL_MPL_FORWARDERS with scope 4.  On acceptance of the\n   MPL4\
    \ message by an interface called \"Interface B\", the MPL4 message\n   is returned\
    \ with Trickle over Interface B.  Consequently, the MPL4\n   message is received\
    \ by the originating Interface A, after which\n   MPL_BLOCKED is set to false.\n\
    \   When a new node is connected to the link, it can immediately send an\n   MPL4\
    \ message, or it can wait for the reception of an MPL4 message to\n   announce\
    \ its intention to be part of the MPL4 zone.\n"

    \ messages\n   arriving at an interface are legal.  It continues with a description\n\
    \   of forwarding legal Admin-Local multicast messages over other MPL\n   Interfaces.\n\
    \   The policy for forwarding Admin-Local multicast messages\n   automatically\
    \ to an MPL Interface is specified as a function of the\n   state of the MPL Interface\
    \ and the multicast message.  The state of\n   the multicast message is determined\
    \ by the presence of the MPL Option\n   [RFC7731] and the destination multicast\
    \ address.  The state of the\n   MPL Interface is determined by the subscribed\
    \ multicast addresses,\n   the zone index [RFC4007], and the values of the PROACTIVE_FORWARDING\n\

- title: 5.  MPL Domains and Zones
  contents:
  - "5.  MPL Domains and Zones\n   An MPL Domain is a scope zone in which MPL Interfaces\
    \ subscribe to\n   the same MPL Domain Address [RFC7731].  In accordance with\
    \ [RFC4007],\n   a zone boundary passes through a node.  For example, a small\n\
    \   Low-Power and Lossy Network (LLN) node usually has one MPL mesh\n   interface\
    \ that is subscribed to the ALL_MPL_FORWARDERS multicast\n   address with a scope\
    \ value of 3 (Realm-Local) [RFC7346].  The node\n   interface belongs to the zone,\
    \ and the corresponding zone boundary\n   does not pass through this node.  In\
    \ the border router with MPL\n   Interfaces subscribed to the multicast address\
    \ ALL_MPL_FORWARDERS\n   with scope value 3, the zone usually includes this single\
    \ interface\n   and excludes all other interfaces.  A notable exception is provided\n\
    \   by a node where MPL Interfaces of the same technology share the same\n   network\
    \ identifier.  These interfaces belong to the same MPL4 zone\n   when the interfaces\
    \ share the same zone index.\n   In an MPL4 router, every MPL Interface subscribes\
    \ to the Admin-Local\n   ALL_MPL_FORWARDERS multicast address in addition to the\
    \ Realm-Local\n   ALL_MPL_FORWARDERS address.\n   Every interface that belongs\
    \ to an MPL Domain that extends over\n   border routers MUST be subscribed to\
    \ the Admin-Local\n   ALL_MPL_FORWARDERS address.\n   The MPL4 zone corresponding\
    \ with the MPL multicast address\n   ALL_MPL_FORWARDERS with scope 4 (Admin-Local)\
    \ applies to border\n   routers with multiple interfaces, of which at least one\
    \ interface is\n   MPL enabled and is subscribed to multicast address ALL_MPL_FORWARDERS\n\
    \   with scope 4.  In a border router, all MPL-enabled interfaces that\n   subscribe\
    \ to the ALL_MPL_FORWARDERS address with scope 4 and for\n   which MPL_BLOCKED\
    \ is false belong to the same MPL4 zone when the\n   interfaces share the same\
    \ zone index.\n   MPL4 messages remain bounded within a zone as defined in [RFC4007].\n\
    \   Consequently, MPL4 messages cannot be routed between interfaces\n   belonging\
    \ to different zones.  When the concept of zone is unknown or\n   disabled in\
    \ a router, all interfaces belong to the same zone.  For\n   example, consider\
    \ a router with five interfaces, where Interfaces A\n   and B belong to zone 1\
    \ and Interfaces C, D, and E belong to zone 2.\n   MPL4 messages can be routed\
    \ freely between Interfaces A and B, and\n   freely between Interfaces C, D, and\
    \ E.  However, an MPL4 message\n   MUST NOT be routed from Interface A to Interface\
    \ D.\n"

  - "7.  Security Considerations\n   The security considerations of [RFC7731] also\
    \ apply to MPL4 routers.\n   The sending of MPL4 messages by a malicious node\
    \ can have unwanted\n   consequences, as explained by the following example. \
    \ It is not\n   unusual for a wired (e.g., Ethernet) link to be used between two\n\
    \   floors or sections of an LLN, as radio propagation through reinforced\n  \
    \ concrete is generally poor.  The MPL4 zone can thus envelop multiple\n   routers,\
    \ meshes, and links.  It is possible that a malicious node\n   could connect to\
    \ a wired link on which no MPL-enabled nodes are\n   foreseen.  In this example\
    \ configuration, the malicious node can send\n   MPL4 messages to the MPL4 router\
    \ interfaces.  When nothing is done,\n   the MPL4 routers will consequently distribute\
    \ MPL4 messages from one\n   mesh over the wired link to the next mesh, although\
    \ the wired link\n   was not expected to transport MPL4 messages.\n   To understand\
    \ the consequences of this unwanted behavior, the\n   following cases should be\
    \ distinguished:\n   o  The source mesh uses Layer 2 encryption.\n   o  The MPL4\
    \ router can be managed.\n   The four possible combinations are discussed below:\n\
    \   Layer 2 unsecured, router unmanaged:  In this case, MPL4 messages are\n  \
    \    freely distributed over meshes and links that are interconnected\n      by\
    \ MPL4 routers within a zone.  The MPL-enabled (malicious) nodes\n      can read\
    \ all MPL4 messages and distribute MPL4 messages over a\n      network limited\
    \ by a zone.  This situation can be acceptable for\n      an isolated network\
    \ within a clearly defined space, where the\n      connection of nodes can be\
    \ tightly controlled.  A completely wired\n      LLN, e.g., such as is seen in\
    \ BACnet (a protocol for building\n      automation and control networks) [BACnet]\
    \ is an example of an\n      unencrypted LLN that would be considered physically\
    \ secure.\n   Layer 2 secured, router unmanaged:  In this case, MPL4 messages\
    \ are\n      freely distributed over meshes and links that are interconnected\n\
    \      by MPL4 routers within a zone.  Following the rules of\n      Section 4.3,\
    \ the MPL4-enabled (malicious) nodes cannot read the\n      MPL4 messages, and\
    \ MPL4 messages sent by the malicious node are\n      not accepted by other nodes.\
    \  This situation is acceptable for a\n      home network or managed network extending\
    \ over precisely one zone,\n      occupying a clearly defined physical space,\
    \ where ease of\n      installation is important.  In such a network, the presence\
    \ of the\n      malicious node is not different from any other malicious node\
    \ that\n      tries to send messages over Layer 2 protected links.  Because the\n\
    \      network occupies exactly one zone, the MPL4 message distribution\n    \
    \  cannot be extended outside the network.\n   Layer 2 unsecured, router managed:\
    \  In this case, the distribution of\n      MPL4 messages over MPL4 router interfaces\
    \ can be limited to those\n      interfaces for which a manager has enabled MPL,\
    \ as well as a set\n      of multicast addresses.  The malicious node cannot extend\
    \ the\n      distribution of MPL4 messages over unwanted interfaces.  It is\n\
    \      important that the handling of the interfaces by the manager is\n     \
    \ protected.  However, MPL4 messages sent over the mesh can be\n      interpreted\
    \ by malicious nodes, and malicious messages can be\n      injected into the set\
    \ of meshes and links that are connected by\n      the MPL4 routers for which\
    \ the manager enabled the interfaces.\n      This situation can be practical for\
    \ interconnected links and\n      meshes that are connected to a LAN over a limited\
    \ period -- for\n      example, during installation of the interconnected meshes\
    \ and\n      links.\n   Layer 2 secured, router managed:  In this case, the distribution\
    \ of\n      MPL4 messages over MPL4 router interfaces can be limited to those\n\
    \      interfaces for which a manager has enabled MPL, as well as a set\n    \
    \  of multicast addresses.  Following the rules of Section 4.3, the\n      malicious\
    \ node cannot extend the distribution of MPL4 messages\n      over unwanted interfaces,\
    \ and MPL4 messages sent by the malicious\n      node are not accepted by other\
    \ nodes.  It is important that the\n      handling of the interfaces by the manager\
    \ is protected.  The\n      MPL-enabled (malicious) nodes cannot read the MPL4\
    \ messages, and\n      MPL4 messages sent by the malicious node are not accepted\
    \ by other\n      nodes.  Depending on the number of managed interfaces, the network\n\
    \      can progressively pass from autoconfigured to fully\n      administratively\
    \ controlled.\n"
