  - "Abstract\n   This memo defines a MIME content-type that may be used by a mail\
    \ user\n   agent (UA) or electronic mail gateway to report the disposition of\
    \ a\n   message after it has been sucessfully delivered to a recipient.  This\n\
    \   content-type is intended to be machine-processable.  Additional\n   message\
    \ headers are also defined to permit Message Disposition\n   Notifications (MDNs)\
    \ to be requested by the sender of a message.  The\n   purpose is to extend Internet\
    \ Mail to support functionality often\n   found in other messaging systems, such\
    \ as X.400 and the proprietary\n   \"LAN-based\" systems, and often referred to\
    \ as \"read receipts,\"\n   \"acknowledgements,\" or \"receipt notifications.\"\
    \  The intention is to\n   do this while respecting the privacy concerns that\
    \ have often been\n   expressed when such functions have been discussed in the\
    \ past.\n   Because many messages are sent between the Internet and other\n  \
    \ messaging systems (such as X.400 or the proprietary \"LAN-based\"\n   systems),\
    \ the MDN protocol is designed to be useful in a multi-\n   protocol messaging\
    \ environment.  To this end, the protocol described\n   in this memo provides\
    \ for the carriage of \"foreign\" addresses, in\n   addition to those normally\
    \ used in Internet Mail.  Additional\n   attributes may also be defined to support\
    \ \"tunneling\" of foreign\n   notifications through Internet Mail.\n"

- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   This memo defines a MIME content-type [5] for message disposition\n\
    \   notifications (MDNs).  An MDN can be used to notify the sender of a\n   message\
    \ of any of several conditions that may occur after successful\n   delivery, such\
    \ as display of the message contents, printing of the\n   message, deletion (without\
    \ display) of the message, or the\n   recipient's refusal to provide MDNs.  The\
    \ \"message/disposition-\n   notification\" content-type defined herein is intended\
    \ for use within\n   the framework of the \"multipart/report\" content type defined\
    \ in RFC\n   1892 [7].\n   This memo defines the format of the notifications and\
    \ the RFC 822\n   headers used to request them.\n   The key words \"MUST\", \"\
    MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\"\
    , \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n   document are to be interpreted\
    \ as described in RFC 2119.\n"
- title: 1.1 Purposes
  contents:
  - "1.1 Purposes\n   The MDNs defined in this memo are expected to serve several\
    \ purposes:\n   (a)  Inform human beings of the disposition of messages after\n\
    \        succcessful delivery, in a manner which is largely independent\n    \
    \    of human language;\n   (b)  Allow mail user agents to keep track of the disposition\
    \ of\n        messages sent, by associating returned MDNs with earlier message\n\
    \        transmissions;\n   (c)  Convey disposition notification requests and\
    \ disposition\n        notifications between Internet Mail and \"foreign\" mail\
    \ systems\n        via a gateway;\n   (d)  Allow \"foreign\" notifications to\
    \ be tunneled through a MIME-\n        capable message system and back into the\
    \ original messaging\n        system that issued the original notification, or\
    \ even to a third\n        messaging system;\n   (e)  Allow language-independent,\
    \ yet reasonably precise, indications\n        of the disposition of a message\
    \ to be delivered.\n"
- title: 1.2 Requirements
  contents:
  - "1.2 Requirements\n   These purposes place the following constraints on the notification\n\
    \   protocol:\n   (a)  It must be readable by humans, as well as being machine-\n\
    \        parsable.\n   (b)  It must provide enough information to allow message\
    \ senders (or\n        their user agents) to unambiguously associate an MDN with\
    \ the\n        message that was sent and the original recipient address for\n\
    \        which the MDN is issued (if such information is available), even\n  \
    \      if the message was forwarded to another recipient address.\n   (c)  It\
    \ must also be able to describe the disposition of a message\n        independent\
    \ of any particular human language or of the\n        terminology of any particular\
    \ mail system.\n   (d)  The specification must be extensible in order to accomodate\n\
    \        future requirements.\n"
- title: 2.  Requesting Message Disposition Notifications
  contents:
  - "2.  Requesting Message Disposition Notifications\n   Message disposition notifications\
    \ are requested by including a\n   Disposition-Notification-To header in the message.\
    \  Further\n   information to be used by the recipient's UA in generating the\
    \ MDN\n   may be provided by including Original-Recipient and/or Disposition-\n\
    \   Notification-Options headers in the message.\n"
- title: 2.1 The Disposition-Notification-To Header
  contents:
  - "2.1 The Disposition-Notification-To Header\n   A request that the receiving user\
    \ agent issue message disposition\n   notifications is made by placing a Disposition-Notification-To\
    \ header\n   into the message.  The syntax of the header, using the ABNF of RFC\n\
    \   822 [2], is\n     mdn-request-header = \"Disposition-Notification-To\" \"\
    :\" 1#mailbox\n   The mailbox token is as specified in RFC 822 [2].\n   The presence\
    \ of a Disposition-Notification-To header in a message is\n   merely a request\
    \ for an MDN.  The recipients' user agents are always\n   free to silently ignore\
    \ such a request.  Alternatively, an explicit\n   denial of the request for information\
    \ about the disposition of the\n   message may be sent using the \"denied\" disposition\
    \ in an MDN.\n   An MDN MUST NOT itself have a Disposition-Notification-To header.\n\
    \   An MDN MUST NOT be generated in response to an MDN.\n   At most one MDN may\
    \ be issued on behalf of each particular recipient\n   by their user agent.  That\
    \ is, once an MDN has been issued on behalf\n   of a recipient, no further MDNs\
    \ may be issued on behalf of that\n   recipient, even if another disposition is\
    \ performed on the message.\n   However, if a message is forwarded, an MDN may\
    \ been issued for the\n   recipient doing the forwarding and the recipient of\
    \ the forwarded\n   message may also cause an MDN to be generated.\n   While Internet\
    \ standards normally do not specify the behavior of user\n   interfaces, it is\
    \ strongly recommended that the user agent obtain the\n   user's consent before\
    \ sending an MDN.  This consent could be obtained\n   for each message through\
    \ some sort of prompt or dialog box, or\n   globally through the user's setting\
    \ of a preference.  The user might\n   also indicate globally that MDNs are never\
    \ to be sent or that a\n   \"denied\" MDN is always sent in response to a request\
    \ for an MDN.\n   MDNs SHOULD NOT be sent automatically if the address in the\n\
    \   Disposition-Notification-To header differs from the address in the\n   Return-Path\
    \ header (see RFC 822 [2]).  In this case, confirmation\n   from the user SHOULD\
    \ be obtained, if possible.  If obtaining consent\n   is not possible (e.g., because\
    \ the user is not online at the time),\n   then an MDN SHOULD NOT be sent.\n \
    \  Confirmation from the user SHOULD be obtained (or no MDN sent) if\n   there\
    \ is no Return-Path header in the message, or if there is more\n   than one distinct\
    \ address in the Disposition-Notification-To header.\n   The comparison of the\
    \ addresses should be done using only the addr-\n   spec (local-part \"@\" domain)\
    \ portion, excluding any phrase and route.\n   The comparison MUST be case-sensitive\
    \ for the local-part and case-\n   insensitive for the domain part.\n   If the\
    \ message contains more than one Return-Path header, the\n   implementation may\
    \ pick one to use for the comparison, or treat the\n   situation as a failure\
    \ of the comparison.\n   The reason for not automatically sending an MDN if the\
    \ comparison\n   fails or more than one address is specified is to reduce the\n\
    \   possibilities for mail loops and use of MDNs for mail bombing.\n   A message\
    \ that contains a Disposition-Notification-To header SHOULD\n   also contain a\
    \ Message-ID header as specified in RFC 822 [2].  This\n   will permit automatic\
    \ correlation of MDNs with original messages by\n   user agents.\n   If it is\
    \ desired to request message disposition notifications for\n   some recipients\
    \ and not others, two copies of the message should be\n   sent, one with an Disposition-Notification-To\
    \ header and one without.\n   Many of the other headers of the message (e.g.,\
    \ To, cc) will be the\n   same in both copies.  The recipients in the respective\
    \ message\n   envelopes determine for whom message disposition notifications are\n\
    \   requested and for whom they are not.  If desired, the Message-ID\n   header\
    \ may be the same in both copies of the message.  Note that\n   there are other\
    \ situations (e.g., bcc) in which it is necessary to\n   send multiple copies\
    \ of a message with slightly different headers.\n   The combination of such situations\
    \ and the need to request MDNs for a\n   subset of all recipients may result in\
    \ more than two copies of a\n   message being sent, some with a Disposition- Notification-To\
    \ header\n   and some without.\n   Messages posted to newsgroups SHOULD NOT have\
    \ a Disposition-\n   Notification-To header.\n"
- title: 2.2 The Disposition-Notification-Options Header
  contents:
  - "2.2 The Disposition-Notification-Options Header\n   Future extensions to this\
    \ specification may require that information\n   be supplied to the recipient's\
    \ UA for additional control over how and\n   what MDNs are generated.  The Disposition-Notification-Options\
    \ header\n   provides an extensible mechanism for such information.  The syntax\
    \ of\n   this header, using the ABNF of RFC 822 [2], is\n     Disposition-Notification-Options\
    \ =\n          \"Disposition-Notification-Options\" \":\"\n          disposition-notification-parameters\n\
    \     disposition-notification-parameters = parameter *(\";\" parameter)\n   \
    \  parameter = attribute \"=\" importance \",\" 1#value\n     importance = \"\
    required\" / \"optional\"\n   The definitions of attribute and value are as in\
    \ the definition of\n   the Content-Type header in RFC 2045 [4].\n   An importance\
    \ of \"required\" indicates that interpretation of the\n   parameter is necessary\
    \ for proper generation of an MDN in response to\n   this request.  If a UA does\
    \ not understand the meaning of the\n   parameter, it MUST NOT generate an MDN\
    \ with any disposition type\n   other than \"failed\" in response to the request.\
    \  An importance of\n   \"optional\" indicates that a UA that does not understand\
    \ the meaning\n   of this parameter MAY generate an MDN in response anyway, ignoring\n\
    \   the value of the parameter.\n   No parameters are defined in this specification.\
    \  Parameters may be\n   defined in the future by later revisions or extensions\
    \ to this\n   specification.  Parameter attribute names beginning with \"X-\"\
    \ will\n   never be defined as standard names; such names are reserved for\n \
    \  experimental use.  MDN parameter names not beginning with \"X-\" MUST\n   be\
    \ registered with the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) and\n   described\
    \ in a standards-track RFC or an experimental RFC approved by\n   the IESG.  See\
    \ Section 10 for a registration form.\n   If a required parameter is not understood\
    \ or contains some sort of\n   error, the receiving UA SHOULD issue an MDN with\
    \ a disposition type\n   of \"failed\" (see Section 3.2.6) and include a Failure\
    \ field (see\n   Section 3.2.7) that further describes the problem.  MDNs with\
    \ the a\n   disposition type of \"failed\" and a \"Failure\" field MAY also be\n\
    \   generated when other types of errors are detected in the parameters\n   of\
    \ the Disposition-Notification-Options header.\n   However, an MDN with a disposition\
    \ type of \"failed\" MUST NOT be\n   generated if the user has indicated a preferance\
    \ that MDNs are not to\n   be sent.  If user consent would be required for an\
    \ MDN of some other\n   disposition type to be sent, user consent SHOULD also\
    \ be obtained\n   before sending an MDN with a disposition type of \"failed\"\
    .\n"
- title: 2.3 The Original-Recipient Header
  contents:
  - "2.3 The Original-Recipient Header\n   Since electronic mail addresses may be\
    \ rewritten while the message is\n   in transit, it is useful for the original\
    \ recipient address to be\n   made available by the delivering MTA.  The delivering\
    \ MTA may be able\n   to obtain this information from the ORCPT parameter of the\
    \ SMTP RCPT\n   TO command, as defined in RFC 1891 [8].  If this information is\n\
    \   available, the delivering MTA SHOULD insert an Original-Recipient\n   header\
    \ at the beginning of the message (along with the Return-Path\n   header).  The\
    \ delivering MTA MAY delete any other Original-Recipient\n   headers that occur\
    \ in the message.  The syntax of this header, using\n   the ABNF of RFC 822 [2],\
    \ is as follows\n     original-recipient-header =\n          \"Original-Recipient\"\
    \ \":\" address-type \";\" generic-address\n   The address-type and generic-address\
    \ token are as as specified in the\n   description of the Original-Recipient field\
    \ in section 3.2.3.\n   The purpose of carrying the original recipient information\
    \ and\n   returning it in the MDN is to permit automatic correlation of MDNs\n\
    \   with the original message on a per-recipient basis.\n"
- title: 2.4 Use with the Message/Partial Content Type
  contents:
  - "2.4 Use with the Message/Partial Content Type\n   The use of the headers Disposition-Notification-To,\
    \ Disposition-\n   Notification-Options, and Original-Recipient with the MIME\n\
    \   Message/partial content type (RFC 2046 [5]) requires further\n   definition.\n\
    \   When a message is segmented into two or more message/partial\n   fragments,\
    \ the three headers mentioned in the above paragraph SHOULD\n   be placed in the\
    \ \"inner\" or \"enclosed\" message (using the terms of\n   RFC 2046 [5]).  These\
    \ headers SHOULD NOT be used in the headers of\n   any of the fragments themselves.\n\
    \   When the multiple message/partial fragments are reassembled, the\n   following\
    \ applies.  If these headers occur along with the other\n   headers of a message/partial\

- title: 3.  Format of a Message Disposition Notification
  contents:
  - "3.  Format of a Message Disposition Notification\n   A message disposition notification\
    \ is a MIME message with a top-\n   level content-type of multipart/report (defined\
    \ in RFC 1892 [7]).\n   When a multipart/report content is used to transmit an\
    \ MDN:\n   (a)  The report-type parameter of the multipart/report content is\n\
    \        \"disposition-notification\".\n   (b)  The first component of the multipart/report\
    \ contains a human-\n        readable explanation of the MDN, as described in\
    \ RFC 1892 [7].\n   (c)  The second component of the multipart/report is of content-type\n\
    \        message/disposition-notification, described in section 3.1 of\n     \
    \   this document.\n   (d)  If the original message or a portion of the message\
    \ is to be\n        returned to the sender, it appears as the third component\
    \ of the\n        multipart/report.  The decision of whether or not to return\
    \ the\n        message or part of the message is up to the UA generating the\n\
    \        MDN.  However, in the case of encrypted messages requesting\n       \
    \ MDNs, encrypted message text MUST be returned, if it is returned\n        at\
    \ all, only in its original encrypted form.\n        NOTE:  For message dispostion\
    \ notifications gatewayed from\n        foreign systems, the headers of the original\
    \ message may not be\n        available.  In this case the third component of\
    \ the MDN may be\n        omitted, or it may contain \"simulated\" RFC 822 headers\
    \ which\n        contain equivalent information.  In particular, it is very\n\
    \        desirable to preserve the subject and date fields from the\n        original\
    \ message.\n   The MDN MUST be addressed (in both the message header and the\n\
    \   transport envelope) to the address(es) from the Disposition-\n   Notification-To\
    \ header from the original message for which the MDN is\n   being generated.\n\
    \   The From field of the message header of the MDN MUST contain the\n   address\
    \ of the person for whom the message disposition notification\n   is being issued.\n\
    \   The envelope sender address (i.e., SMTP MAIL FROM) of the MDN MUST be\n  \
    \ null (<>), specifying that no Delivery Status Notification messages\n   or other\
    \ messages indicating successful or unsuccessful delivery are\n   to be sent in\
    \ response to an MDN.\n   A message disposition notification MUST NOT itself request\
    \ an MDN.\n   That is, it MUST NOT contain a Disposition-Notification-To header.\n\
    \   The Message-ID header (if present) for an MDN MUST be different from\n   the\
    \ Message-ID of the message for which the MDN is being issued.\n   A particular\
    \ MDN describes the disposition of exactly one message for\n   exactly one recipient.\
    \  Multiple MDNs may be generated as a result of\n   one message submission, one\
    \ per recipient.  However, due to the\n   circumstances described in Section 2.1,\

    \ from foreign disposition\n        reports to be tunneled through Internet MDNs.\
    \  The names of such\n        MDN fields should begin with an indication of the\

- title: 5.  Conformance and Usage Requirements
  contents:
  - "5.  Conformance and Usage Requirements\n   A UA or gateway conforms to this specification\
    \ if it generates MDNs\n   according to the protocol defined in this memo.  It\
    \ is not necessary\n   to be able to generate all of the possible values of the\
    \ Disposition\n   field.\n   UAs and gateways MUST NOT generate the Original-Recipient\
    \ field of an\n   MDN unless the mail protocols provide the address originally\n\
    \   specified by the sender at the time of submission.  Ordinary SMTP\n   does\
    \ not make that guarantee, but the SMTP extension defined in RFC\n   1891 [8]\
    \ permits such information to be carried in the envelope if it\n   is available.\
    \  The Original-Recipient header defined in this document\n   provides a way for\
    \ the MTA to pass the original recipient address to\n   the UA.\n   Each sender-specified\
    \ recipient address may result in more than one\n   MDN.  If an MDN is requested\
    \ for a recipient that is forwarded to\n   multiple recipients of an \"alias\"\
    \ (as defined in RFC 1891 [8],\n   section 6.2.7.3), each of the recipients may\
    \ issue an MDN.\n   Successful distribution of a message to a mailing list exploder\n\
    \   SHOULD be considered final disposition of the message.  A mailing\n   list\
    \ exploder may issue an MDN with a disposition type of \"processed\"\n   and disposition\
    \ modes of \"automatic-action\" and \"MDN- sent-\n   automatically\" indicating\
    \ that the message has been forwarded to the\n   list.  In this case, the request\
    \ for MDNs is not propogated to the\n   members of the list.\n   Alternaively,\
    \ the mailing list exploder may issue no MDN and\n   propogate the request for\
    \ MDNs to all members of the list.  The\n   latter behavior is not recommended\
    \ for any but small, closely knit\n   lists, as it might cause large numbers of\
    \ MDNs to be generated and\n   may cause confidential subscribers to the list\
    \ to be revealed.  It is\n   also permissible for the mailing list exploder to\
    \ direct MDNs to\n   itself, correlate them, and produce a report to the original\
    \ sender\n   of the message.\n   This specification places no restrictions on\
    \ the processing of MDNs\n   received by user agents or mailing lists.\n"

  contents:
  - "6.  Security Considerations\n   The following security considerations apply when\
    \ using MDNs:\n"
- title: 6.1 Forgery
  contents:
  - "6.1 Forgery\n   MDNs may be forged as easily as ordinary Internet electronic\
    \ mail.\n   User agents and automatic mail handling facilities (such as mail\n\
    \   distribution list exploders) that wish to make automatic use of MDNs\n   should\
    \ take appropriate precautions to minimize the potential damage\n   from denial-of-service\
    \ attacks.\n   Security threats related to forged MDNs include the sending of:\n\
    \   (a)  A falsified disposition notification when the indicated\n        disposition\
    \ of the message has not actually ocurred,\n   (b)  Unsolicited MDNs\n"
- title: 6.2 Confidentiality
  contents:
  - "6.2 Confidentiality\n   Another dimension of security is confidentiality.  There\
    \ may be cases\n   in which a message recipient does not wish the disposition\
    \ of\n   messages addressed to him to be known or is concerned that the\n   sending\
    \ of MDNs may reveal other confidential information (e.g., when\n   the message\
    \ was read).  In this situation, it is acceptable for the\n   UA to issue \"denied\"\
    \ MDNs or to silently ignore requests for MDNs.\n   If the Disposition-Notification-To\
    \ header is passed on unmodified\n   when a message is distributed to the subscribers\
    \ of a mailing list,\n   the subscribers to the list may be revealed to the sender\
    \ of the\n   original message by the generation of MDNs.\n   Headers of the original\
    \ message returned in part 3 of the\n   multipart/report could reveal confidential\
    \ information about host\n   names and/or network topology inside a firewall.\n\
    \   An unencrypted MDN could reveal confidential information about an\n   encrypted\
    \ message, especially if all or part of the original message\n   is returned in\
    \ part 3 of the multipart/report.  Encrypted MDNs are\n   not defined in this\
    \ specification.\n   In general, any optional MDN field may be omitted if the\
    \ Reporting UA\n   site or user determines that inclusion of the field would impose\
    \ too\n   great a compromise of site confidentiality.  The need for such\n   confidentiality\
    \ must be balanced against the utility of the omitted\n   information in MDNs.\n"
- title: 6.3 Non-Repudiation
  contents:
  - "6.3 Non-Repudiation\n   Within the framework of today's Internet Mail, the MDNs\
    \ defined in\n   this document provide valuable information to the mail user;\
    \ however,\n   MDNs can not be relied upon as a guarantee that a message was or\
    \ was\n   not not seen by the recipient.  Even if MDNs are not actively forged,\n\

  contents:
  - "8.1 Gatewaying from other mail systems to MDNs\n   A mail gateway may issue an\
    \ MDN to convey the contents of a \"foreign\"\n   disposition notification over\
    \ Internet Mail.  When there are\n   appropriate mappings from the foreign notification\
    \ elements to MDN\n   fields, the information may be transmitted in those MDN\
    \ fields.\n   Additional information (such as might be needed to tunnel the foreign\n\
    \   notification through the Internet) may be defined in extension MDN\n   fields.\
    \  (Such fields should be given names that identify the foreign\n   mail protocol,\
    \ e.g. X400-* for X.400 protocol elements)\n   The gateway must attempt to supply\
    \ reasonable values for the\n   Reporting-UA, Final-Recipient, and Disposition\
    \ fields.  These will\n   normally be obtained by translating the values from\
    \ the foreign\n   notification into their Internet-style equivalents.  However,\
    \ some\n   loss of information is to be expected.\n   The sender-specified recipient\
    \ address, and the original message-id,\n   if present in the foreign notification,\
    \ should be preserved in the\n   Original-Recipient and Original-Message-ID fields.\n\
    \   The gateway should also attempt to preserve the \"final\" recipient\n   address\
    \ from the foreign system.  Whenever possible, foreign protocol\n   elements should\
    \ be encoded as meaningful printable ASCII strings.\n   For MDNs produced from\

  contents:
  - "8.2 Gatewaying from MDNs to other mail systems\n   It may be possible to gateway\

    \ of such gatewaying is to convey\n   disposition information in a form that is\
    \ usable by the destination\n   system.  A secondary purpose is to allow \"tunneling\"\
    \ of MDNs through\n   foreign mail systems, in case the MDN may be gatewayed back\
    \ into the\n   Internet.\n   In general, the recipient of the MDN (i.e., the sender\
    \ of the\n   original message) will want to know, for each recipient:  the closest\n\
    \   available approximation to the original recipient address, and the\n   disposition\
    \ (displayed, printed, etc.).\n   If possible, the gateway should attempt to preserve\
