- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   The Optimized Link State Routing Protocol version 2 [RFC7181]\
    \ is a\n   proactive link state routing protocol designed for use in mobile ad\n\
    \   hoc networks (MANETs) [RFC2501].  This document improves one area of\n   the\
    \ OLSRv2 specification.\n   One improvement included in OLSRv2, compared to its\
    \ predecessor\n   described in [RFC3626], is the use of link metrics, rather than\n\
    \   minimum-hop routing.  A rationale for how link metrics were included\n   in\
    \ OLSRv2 is documented in [RFC7185].  However, one aspect of the use\n   of link\
    \ metrics described in [RFC7185], the removal of some\n   unnecessarily selected\
    \ routing multipoint relays (MPRs), was not\n   included in [RFC7181].  This specification\
    \ updates OLSRv2 to include\n   this optimization.\n   Note that this optimization\
    \ does not impact interoperability:\n   implementations that do and do not implement\
    \ this optimization will\n   interoperate seamlessly.\n"
- title: 2.  Terminology
  contents:
  - "2.  Terminology\n   The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\"\
    , \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"NOT RECOMMENDED\"\
    , \"MAY\", and\n   \"OPTIONAL\" in this document are to be interpreted as described\
    \ in\n   [RFC2119].\n   Additionally, this document uses the terminology of [RFC7181].\n"
- title: 3.  Applicability Statement
  contents:
  - "3.  Applicability Statement\n   This specification updates [RFC7181].  As such,\
    \ it is applicable to\n   all implementations of this protocol.  The optimization\
    \ presented in\n   this specification is simply permissive; it allows an additional\n\
    \   optimization, and there is no requirement for any implementation to\n   include\
    \ it.  However, inclusion of this optimization is advised; it\n   can, in some\
    \ cases, create smaller and fewer messages, without ever\n   having the opposite\
    \ effect.\n   [RFC7181] defines the properties for the selection of routing MPRs\n\
    \   from among a router's symmetric 1-hop neighbors.  The properties are\n   o\
    \  the selected MPRs must consist of a set of symmetric 1-hop\n      neighbors\
    \ that cover all the symmetric 2-hop neighbors, and\n   o  the selected MPRs must\
    \ do so retaining a minimum distance route\n      (1-hop, if present, or 2-hop)\
    \ to each symmetric 2-hop neighbor.\n   The discussion in the latter part of Section\
    \ 6.2 of [RFC7185]\n   indicates that this requirement is overly prescriptive\
    \ for routing\n   MPR selection.  The update to [RFC7181] described in this\n\
    \   specification permits a router to use the described optimization,\n   while\
    \ still being considered compliant with OLSRv2.\n   Note that whether or not a\
    \ router is considered compliant, a router\n   that implements the optimization\
    \ described in this specification will\n   interoperate successfully with routers\
    \ that are not implementing this\n   optimization.\n"
- title: 4.  Routing MPR Selection
  contents:
  - "4.  Routing MPR Selection\n   A set of routing MPRs created as specified in [RFC7181]\
    \ MAY be\n   optimized in the following manner.  Note that this uses the notation\n\
    \   of Section 18.2 of [RFC7181]:\n   1.  If there is a sequence x_0, ..., x_n\
    \ of elements of N1 such that:\n       *  x_0 is a routing MPR,\n       *  x_1,\
    \ ... , x_n have corresponding elements y_1, ..., y_n of\n          N2, and\n\
    \       *  d1(x_0) + d2(x_0,y_1) + ... + d2(x_m-1,y_m) < d1(x_m) for m =\n   \
    \       1, ... , n,\n       then x_1 to x_n may be removed from the set of routing\
    \ MPRs, if\n       selected.\n   Note that \"corresponding elements\" in N1 and\
    \ N2 means that these\n   elements represent the same router.  All of this information\
    \ is\n   available from information gathered by NHDP [RFC6130].\n"
- title: 5.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "5.  Security Considerations\n   The update to OLSRv2 [RFC7181] does not introduce\
    \ any new protocol\n   signals, nor does it change the processing of any received\
    \ protocol\n   signals.\n   This update to OLSRv2 [RFC7181] permits an implementation\
    \ that is\n   compliant with OLSRv2 to (potentially) eliminate some unneeded\n\
    \   routers from the routing MPR sets generated as described in\n   [RFC7181],\
    \ which also eliminates the need to include the\n   corresponding information\
    \ in generated Topology Control (TC)\n   messages.  Because this information is\
    \ not used when included, this\n   update to OLSRv2 [RFC7181] does not present\
    \ any additional security\n   considerations, beyond those described in [RFC7181].\n"
