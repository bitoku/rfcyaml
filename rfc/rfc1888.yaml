- title: 1. General recommendation on NSAP addressing plans
  contents:
  - "1. General recommendation on NSAP addressing plans\n   This recommendation is\
    \ addressed to network implementors who have\n   already planned or deployed an\
    \ OSI NSAP addressing plan for the usage\n   of OSI CLNP [IS8473] according to\
    \ the OSI network layer addressing\n   plan [IS8348] using ES-IS and IS-IS routing\
    \ [IS9542, IS10589].  It\n   recommends how they should adapt their addressing\
    \ plan for use with\n   IPv6 [RFC1883].\n   The majority of known CLNP addressing\
    \ plans use either the Digital\n   Country Code (DCC) or the International Code\
    \ Designator (ICD) formats\n   defined in [IS8348]. A particular example of this\
    \ is the US\n   Government OSI Profile Version 2 (GOSIP) addressing plan [RFC1629].\n\
    \   The basic NSAP addressing scheme and current implementations are\n   summarised\
    \ in Annex A.\n   [IS8348] specifies a maximum NSAPA (NSAP address) size of 20\
    \ bytes\n   and some network implementors have designed address allocation\n \
    \  schemes which make use of this 20 byte address space.\n   Other NSAP addressing\
    \ plans have been specified by the ITU-T for\n   public data services, such as\
    \ X.25 and ISDN, and these can also have\n   addresses up to 20 bytes in length.\n\
    \   The general recommendation is that implementors SHOULD design native\n   IPv6\
    \ addressing plans according to [RFC1884], but doing so as a\n   natural re-mapping\
    \ of their CLNP addressing plans. While it is\n   impossible to give a general\
    \ recipe for this, CLNP addresses in DCC\n   or ICD format can normally be split\
    \ into two parts: the high order\n   part relating to the network service provider\
    \ and the low order part\n   relating to the user network topology and host computers.\n\
    \   For example, in some applications of US GOSIP the high order part is\n   the\
    \ AFI, ICD, DFI, AA and RD fields, together occupying 9 bytes. The\n   low order\
    \ part is the Area and ID fields, together occupying 8 bytes.\n   (The selector\
    \ byte and the two reserved bytes are not part of the\n   addressing plan.) Thus,\
    \ in such a case, the high-order part could be\n   replaced by the provider part\
    \ of an IPv6 provider-based addressing\n   plan.  An 8-byte prefix is recommended\
    \ for this case and [RFC1884]\n   MUST be followed in planning such a replacement.\
    \ The low order part\n   would then be mapped directly in the low-order half of\
    \ the IPv6\n   address space, and user site address plans are unchanged.  A 6-byte\n\
    \   ID field, exactly as used in US GOSIP and other CLNP addressing\n   plans,\
    \ will be acceptable as the token for IPv6 autoconfiguration\n   [RFC1971].\n\
    \   Analogous rules would be applied for other CLNP addressing plans\n   similar\
    \ to US GOSIP, which is used only as a well known example.\n   Three warnings\
    \ must be carefully considered in every case:\n   1. The ES-IS/IS-IS model employs\
    \ a routing hierarchy down to the Area\n   level, but not all end systems in an\
    \ Area need to be in the same\n   physical subnet (on the same \"wire\" or \"\
    link\"). IS routers on\n   different links within a given Area exchange information\
    \ about the\n   end systems they can each reach directly.  In contrast, the IPv6\n\
    \   routing model extends down to the subnet level and all hosts in the\n   same\
    \ subnet are assumed to be on the same link. In mapping a CLNP\n   addressing\
    \ plan into IPv6 format, without changing the physical\n   topology, it may be\
    \ necessary to add an extra level of hierarchy to\n   cope with this mismatch.\
    \ In other words, the Area number cannot\n   blindly be mapped as a subnet number,\
    \ unless the physical network\n   topology corresponds to this mapping.\n   2.\
    \ It is highly desirable that subnet addresses can be aggregated for\n   wide\
    \ area routing purposes, to minimise the size of routing tables.\n   Thus network\
    \ implementors should ensure that the address prefix used\n   for all their subnets\
    \ is the same, regardless of whether a particular\n   subnet is using a pure IPv6\
    \ addressing scheme or one derived from a\n   CLNP scheme as above.\n   3. Some\
    \ hosts have more than one physical network interface.  In the\n   ES-IS model,\
    \ an end system may have more than one NSAP address, each\n   of which identifies\
    \ the host as a whole.  Such an end system with\n   more than one physical interface\
    \ may be referenced by any one of the\n   NSAPs, and reached via any one of the\
    \ physical connections.  In the\n   IPv6 model, a host may have multiple IPv6\
    \ addresses per interface,\n   but each of its physical interfaces must have its\
    \ own unique\n   addresses. This restriction must be applied when mapping an NSAP\n\
    \   addressing plan into an IPv6 addressing plan for such hosts.\n   This document\
    \ does not address the issues associated with migrating\n   the routing protocols\
    \ used with CLNP (ES-IS or IS-IS) and transition\n   of their network infrastructure.\n"
- title: 2. Summary of defined mechanisms
  contents:
  - "2. Summary of defined mechanisms\n   This document defines four distinct mechanisms.\
    \  All of these are\n   ELECTIVE mechanisms, i.e. they are not mandatory parts\
    \ of an IPv6\n   implementation, but if such mechanisms are needed they MUST be\n\
    \   implemented as defined in this document.\n      1. Restricted NSAPA mapping\

    \    4. IPv6 address carried as OSI address\n   To clarify the relationship between\
    \ the first three mechanisms, note\n   that:\n      If the first byte of an IPv6\
    \ address is hexadecimal 0x02 (binary\n      00000010), then the remaining 15\
    \ bytes SHALL contain a restricted\n      NSAPA mapped as in Chapter 3 below.\
    \ The term \"restricted\" is used\n      to indicate that this format is currently\
    \ restricted to a subset\n      of the ICD and DCC formats.\n      If the first\
    \ byte of an IPv6 address is hexadecimal 0x03 (binary\n      00000011), then the\
    \ remaining 15 bytes SHALL contain a truncated\n      NSAPA as described in Chapter\
    \ 4 below. EITHER a destination option\n      containing the complete NSAPA of\
    \ any format, as described in\n      Chapter 5 below, OR an encapsulated CLNP\
    \ packet, SHALL be present.\n      With any other format of IPv6 address, a destination\

    \ be\n      present.\n"

  contents:
  - "3. Restricted NSAPA in a 16-byte IPv6 address for ICD and DCC\n   Some organizations\
    \ may decide for various reasons not to follow the\n   above general recommendation\
    \ to redesign their addressing plan.  They\n   may wish to use their existing\
    \ OSI NSAP addressing plan unchanged for\n   IPv6. It should be noted that such\
    \ a decision has serious\n   implications for routing, since it means that routing\
    \ between such\n   organizations and the rest of the Internet is unlikely to be\n\
    \   optimised. An organization using both native IPv6 addresses and NSAP\n   addresses\

    \ protocols, may be used in IPv6 routing headers.\n"
- title: 3.1 Routing restricted NSAPAs
  contents:
  - "3.1 Routing restricted NSAPAs\n   As mentioned in Chapter 1, there is a mismatch\
    \ between the OSI or\n   GOSIP routing model and the IPv6 routing model. Restricted\
    \ NSAPAs can\n   be routed hierarchically down to the Area level but must be flat-\n\
    \   routed within an Area. Normal IPv6 addresses can be routed\n   hierarchically\
    \ down to physical subnet (link) level and only have to\n   be flat-routed on\
    \ the physical subnet.\n   Thus, packets whose destination address is a restricted\
    \ NSAPA can be\n   routed using any normal IPv6 routing protocol only as far as\
    \ the\n   Area. If the Area contains more than one physical subnet reached by\n\
    \   more than one router, no IPv6 routing protocol can route the packet\n   to\
    \ the correct final router.  There is no solution to this problem\n   within the\
    \ existing IPv6 mechanisms.  Presumably a flooding\n   algorithm, or a suitably\
    \ adapted implementation of ES-IS, could solve\n   this problem.\n   In the absence\
    \ of such a routing protocol, either the Area number\n   must be hierarchically\
    \ structured to correspond to physical subnets,\n   or each Area must be limited\
    \ to one physical subnet.\n   It is necessary in an IPv6 network that routes may\
    \ be aggregated to\n   minimise the size of routing tables. If a subscriber is\
    \ using both\n   normal IPv6 addresses [RFC1884] and restricted NSAPAs, these\
    \ two\n   types of address will certainly not aggregate with each other, since\n\
    \   they differ from the second most significant bit onwards. This means\n   that\
    \ there may be a significant operational penalty for using both\n   types of address\
    \ with currently known routing technology.\n"

    \   If appropriate, when used as a destination IPv6 address, the\n   truncated\
    \ NSAPA may be interpreted as an IPv6 anycast address.  An\n   anycast address\
    \ may be used to identify either an IPv6 node, or\n   potentially even an OSI\
    \ End System or Intermediate System.  For\n   example, it might be configured\
    \ to identify the endpoints of a CLNP\n   tunnel, or it might identify a particular\
    \ OSI capable system in a\n   particular subnet.\n   If a truncated NSAPA is used\
    \ as a source address, it must be\n   interpreted as a unicast address and must\
    \ therefore be uniquely\n   assigned within the IPv6 address space.\n   If a truncated\
    \ NSAPA is used as either the source or destination IPv6\n   address (or both),\
    \ EITHER an NSAPA destination option OR an\n   encapsulated CLNP packet MUST be\
    \ present. It is the responsibility of\n   the destination system to take the\
    \ appropriate action for each IPv6\n   packet received (e.g. forward, decapsulate,\
    \ discard) and, if\n   necessary, return to the originating host an appropriate\
    \ ICMP error\n   message.\n   If the truncated NSAPA is used to identify a router,\
    \ and an NSAPA\n   destination option is present, then it is the responsibility\
    \ of that\n   router to forward the complete IPv6 packet to the appropriate host\n\
    \   based upon the Destination NSAP field in the NSAPA option.  This\n   forwarding\
    \ process may be based upon static routing information (i.e.\n   a manual mapping\
    \ of NSAPs to IPv6 unicast addresses), or it may be\n   gathered in an automated\
    \ fashion analogous to the ES-IS mechanism,\n   perhaps using extensions to the\
    \ Neighbor Discovery protocol\n   [RFC1970].  The details of such a mechanism\
    \ are beyond the scope of\n   this document.\n   This document does not restrict\
    \ the formats of NSAP address that may\n   be used in truncated NSAPAs, but it\
    \ is apparent that binary ICD or\n   DCC formats will be much easier to accomodate\
    \ in an IPv6 routing\n   infrastructure than the other formats defined in [IS8348].\n\
    \   It is not expected that IPv6 autoconfiguration [RFC1971] and\n   discovery\
    \ [RFC1970] will work unchanged for truncated NSAPAs.\n   Truncated NSAPAs are\
    \ not meaningful within IPv6 routing headers, and\n   there is no way to include\
    \ full NSAPAs in routing headers.\n   If a packet whose source address is a truncated\
    \ NSAPA causes an ICMP\n   message to be returned for whatever reason, this ICMP\
    \ message may be\n   discarded rather than being returned to the true source of\
    \ the\n   packet.\n"

  - "4.1 Routing truncated NSAPAs\n   This is a grey area. If the truncated NSAPA\
    \ retains a hierarchical\n   structure, it can be routed like a restricted NSAPA,\
    \ subject to the\n   same problem concerning the mismatch between Areas and subnets.\
    \  If\n   possible, in the case of a GOSIP-like NSAPA, it should be truncated\n\
    \   immediately after the Area number. In this case the routing\n   considerations\
    \ will be similar to those for restricted NSAPAs, except\n   that final delivery\
    \ of the packet will depend on the last IPv6 router\n   being able to interpret\

    \ general case, nothing can be said since the NSAPA could have\n   almost any\

    \ in place of a normal IPv6 address.\n   IPv6 nodes are not required to implement\
    \ this option, except for\n   nodes using truncated NSAPAs other than for CLNP\

  contents:
  - "6. IPv6 addresses inside an NSAPA\n   If it is required, for whatever reason,\
    \ to embed an IPv6 address\n   inside a 20-octet NSAP address, then the following\
    \ format MUST be\n   used.\n   A specific possible use of this embedding is to\
    \ express an IP address\n   within the ATM Forum address format.  Another  possible\
    \ use would be\n   to allow CLNP packets that encapsulate IPv6 packets to be routed\
    \ in a\n   CLNP network using the IPv6 address architecture. Several leading\n\
    \   bytes of the IPv6 address could be used as a CLNP routing prefix.\n   The\
    \ first three octets are an IDP in binary format, using the AFI\n   code in the\
    \ process of being allocated to the IANA. The AFI value\n   provisionally allocated\
    \ is 35, but this requires a formal\n   modification to [IS8348].  The encoding\
    \ format is as for AFI value 47\n   [IS8348]. The third octet of the IDP is known\
    \ as the ICP (Internet\n   Code Point) and its value must be zero. All other values\
    \ are reserved\n   for allocation by the IANA.\n   Thus an AFI value of 35 with\
    \ an ICP value of zero means that \"this\n   NSAPA embeds a 16 byte IPv6 address\"\
    .\n   The last octet is a selector.  To maintain compatibility with both\n   NSAP\
    \ format and IPv6 addressing, this octet must be present, but it\n   has no significance\
    \ for IPv6. Its default value is zero.\n       0                   1         \

    \ or 0x03, and an NSAPA with\n   the IANA AFI code MUST NOT be embedded in an\
    \ IPv6 header.\n   An NSAPA with the IANA AFI code and ICP set to zero is converted\
    \ to\n   an IPv6 address by stripping off the first three and the twentieth\n\

- title: 'Annex B: Additional Rationale'
  contents:
  - "Annex B: Additional Rationale\n   This annex is intended to give additional rationale,\
    \ motivation and\n   justification for the support of NSAPAs in an IPv6 network.\n\
    \   There are several models for OSI-IPv6 convergence, of which address\n   mapping\
    \ is only one. The other models can be identified as\n    1. Dual stack coexistence,\
    \ in which a CLNP network and an IPv6\n       network exist side by side indefinitely\
    \ using multiprotocol\n       routers.\n    2. CLNP tunnels over IPv6.\n    3.\
    \ OSI transport over IPv6.\n    4. OSI transport over UDP.\n    5. OSI transport\
    \ over TCP (compare RFC 1006)\n   The present model is more fundamental, as it\
    \ attempts to unify and\n   reconcile the OSI and IPv6 addressing and routing\
    \ schemes, and\n   replace CLNP by IPv6 at the network level. The rationale for\
    \ this\n   choice is to preserve investment in NSAPA allocation schemes, and to\n\
    \   open the door for peer-to-peer routing models between IPv6 and bearer\n  \
    \ services (such as ATM) using NSAPA addressing. It should be noted\n   that such\
    \ peer-to-peer models are contentious at the time of writing,\n   but in any case\
    \ a consistent address mapping is preferable to\n   multiple mappings.\n   In\
    \ addition to their use to retain an existing addressing plan,\n   certain other\
    \ uses of restricted NSAPAs could be envisaged.  They\n   could be used as an\
    \ intermediate addressing plan for a network making\n   a transition from CLNP\
    \ to IPv6. They could be used in a header\n   translation scheme for dynamic translation\
    \ between IPv6 and CLNP.\n   They could be used to allow CLNP and IPv6 traffic\
    \ to share the same\n   routing architecture within an organization (\"Ships in\
    \ the Day\").\n   It should be noted that the use of full NSAPA addresses in end\n\
    \   systems impacts many things. The most obvious are the API and DNS. If\n  \
    \ applications are to work normally, everything that has to be modified\n   to\
    \ cope with IPv6 addresses has to be further modified for full\n   NSAPAs.  The\
    \ mechanisms defined in the present document are only a\n   small part of the\
    \ whole.\n   A destination option was chosen to carry full NSAPAs, in preference\n\
    \   to a dedicated extension header.  In the case of an extension header,\n  \
    \ all IPv6 nodes would have needed to understand its syntax merely in\n   order\
    \ to ignore it. In contrast, intermediate nodes can ignore the\n   destination\
    \ option without any knowledge of its syntax. Thus only\n   nodes interested in\
    \ NSAPAs need to know anything about them.\n   Thus we end up with two classes\
    \ of IPv6 nodes:\n   1. Nodes knowing only about 16 byte addresses (including\
    \ restricted\n   NSAPAs, which behave largely like any other IPv6 addresses).\n\
    \   2. Nodes also knowing about 20 byte NSAPAs, either as an extension of\n  \
    \ the IPv6 address space or as the CLNP address space. In either case,\n   regions\
    \ of the network containing such nodes are connected to each\n   other by unicast\
    \ or anycast tunnels through the 16 byte address\n   space. Routing, system configuration,\
    \ and neighbour discovery in the\n   NSAPA regions are outside the scope of the\
    \ normal IPv6 mechanisms.\n"
