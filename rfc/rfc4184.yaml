  - "1.  Introduction\n   AC-3 [ATSC] is a high-quality audio codec (audio coding
    format)\n   designed to encode multiple channels of audio into a low bit-rate\n
    \  format.  AC-3 achieves its large compression ratios via encoding a\n   multiplicity
    of channels as a single entity.  Dolby Digital, which is\n   a branded version
    of AC-3, encodes up to 5.1 channels of audio.\n   AC-3 has been adopted as an
    audio compression scheme for many\n   consumer and professional applications.
    \ It is a mandatory audio\n   codec for DVD-video, Advanced Television Standards
    Committee (ATSC)\n   digital terrestrial television and Digital Living Network
    Alliance\n   (DLNA) home networking, as well as an optional multichannel audio\n
    \  format for DVD-audio.\n   There is a need to stream AC-3 data over IP networks.
    \ The Internet\n   Real Time Protocol (RTP) provides a mechanism for stream\n
    \  synchronization and hence serves as the best transport solution for\n   AC-3,
    which is primarily used in audio-for-video applications.\n   Applications for
    streaming AC-3 include streaming movies from a home\n   media server to a display,
    video on demand, and multichannel Internet\n   radio.\n   Section 2 gives a brief
    overview of the AC-3 algorithm.  Section 3\n   specifies values for fields in
    the RTP header, while Section 4\n   specifies the AC-3 payload format.  Section
    5 discusses media types\n   and SDP usage.  Security considerations are covered
    in Section 6,\n   congestion control in Section 7, and IANA considerations in
    Section\n   8.  References are given in Sections 9 and 10.\n   The key words \"MUST\",
    \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD
    NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n   document are to

  - "2.  Overview of AC-3\n   AC-3 can deliver up to 5.1 channels of audio at data
    rates\n   approximately equal to half of one PCM channel [ATSC], [1994AC3],\n
    \  [1996AC3].  The \".1\" refers to a band-limited, optional, low-\n   frequency
    effects (LFE) channel.  AC-3 was designed for signals\n   sampled at rates of
    32, 44.1, or 48 kHz.  Data rates can vary between\n   32 kbps and 640 kbps, depending
    on the number of channels and the\n   desired quality.\n   AC-3 exploits psycho-acoustic
    phenomena that cause a significant\n   fraction of the information contained in
    a typical audio signal to be\n   inaudible.  Substantial data reduction occurs
    via the removal of\n   inaudible information contained in an audio stream.  Source
    coding\n   techniques are further used to reduce the data rate.\n   Like most
    perceptual coders, AC-3 operates in the frequency domain.\n   A 512-point TDAC
    transform is taken with 50% overlap, providing 256\n   new frequency samples.
    \ Frequency samples are then converted to\n   exponents and mantissas.  Exponents
    are differentially encoded.\n   Mantissas are allocated a varying number of bits
    depending on the\n   audibility of the associated spectral components.  Audibility
    is\n   determined via a masking curve.  Bits for mantissas are allocated\n   from
    a global bit pool.\n"
  - contents:
    - "2.1.  AC-3 Bit Stream\n   AC-3 bit streams are organized into synchronization
      frames.  Each\n   AC-3 frame contains a Synchronization Information (SI) field,
      a Bit\n   Stream Information (BSI) field, and 6 audio blocks (ABs) that each\n
      \  represent 256 PCM samples for all channels.  The frame ends with an\n   optional
      auxiliary data field (AUX) and an error correction field\n   (CRC).  The entire
      frame represents the time duration of 1536 PCM\n   samples across all coded
      channels [ATSC].  AC-3 encodes audio sampled\n   at 32 kHz, 44.1 kHz, and 48
      kHz.  From Annex A, Part 2, of [ATSC],\n   the time duration of an AC-3 frame
      varies with the sampling rate as\n   follows:\n      Sampling rate          Frame

      \                       Figure 1. AC-3 Frame Format\n   The Synchronization
      Information field contains information needed to\n   acquire and maintain codec
      synchronization.  The Bit Stream\n   Information field contains parameters that
      describe the coded audio\n   service [ATSC].  Each audio block contains fields
      that indicate the\n   use of various coding tools: block switching, dither,
      coupling, and\n   exponent strategy.  They also contain metadata, optionally
      used to\n   enhance the playback, such as dynamic range control.  Finally, the\n
      \  exponents and bit allocation data needed to decode the mantissas into\n   audio
      data, and the mantissas themselves, are included.  The\n   placement of these
      fields in an AC-3 audio block is shown in Figure\n   2.  The fields shown in

    payload type for this\n     packet format is outside the scope of this document.

    \    used, or signaled dynamically out-of-band (e.g., using SDP).\n   o Marker
    (M) bit: The M bit is set to one to indicate that the RTP\n     packet payload
    contains at least one complete AC-3 frame or\n     contains the final fragment
    of an AC-3 frame.\n   o Extension (X) bit: Defined by the RTP profile used.\n
    \  o Timestamp: A 32-bit word that corresponds to the sampling instant\n     for
    the first AC-3 frame in the RTP packet.  Packets containing\n     fragments of
    the same frame MUST have the same time stamp.  The\n     timestamp of the first
    RTP packet sent SHOULD be selected at\n     random.  Thereafter, the timestamp
    increases linearly with the\n     number of samples included in each frame (i.e.,

    defined in\n   Annex E of [ATSC], and it MUST NOT be used to carry E-AC-3.\n   According
    to [RFC2736], RTP payload formats should contain an\n   integral number of application
    data units (ADUs).  The AC-3 frame\n   corresponds to an ADU, in the context of
    this payload format.  Each\n   RTP payload MUST start with the two-byte payload
    header followed by\n   an integral number of complete AC-3 frames or by a single
    fragment of\n   an AC-3 frame.\n   If an AC-3 frame exceeds the MTU for a network,

        1, 2, or 3), it is\n     used to indicate the number fragments (and therefore
        packets) that\n     make up the current frame.  NF MUST be identical for packets\n

    - "4.2.  Fragmentation of AC-3 Frames\n   The size of an AC-3 frame depends on
      the sample rate of the audio and\n   the data rate used by the encoder (which
      are indicated in the\n   \"Synchronization Information\" header in the AC-3
      frame).  The size of\n   a frame, for a given sample rate and data rate, is
      specified in Table\n   5.18 (\"Frame Size Code Table\") of [ATSC].  This table
      shows that AC-3\n   frames range in size from a minimum of 128 bytes to a maximum
      of 3840\n   bytes.  If the size of an AC-3 frame exceeds the MTU size, the frame\n
      \  SHOULD be fragmented at the RTP level.  The fragmentation MAY be\n   performed
      at any byte boundary in the frame.  RTP packets containing\n   fragments of

      fragment.  This enables a receiver to assemble the\n   fragments in correct
