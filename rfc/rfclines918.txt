Introduction The intent of the Post Office Protocol (POP) is to allow a user's workstation to access mail from a mailbox server.
It is expected that mail will be posted from the workstation to the mailbox server via the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP).
For further information see RFC 821 [1] and RFC 822 [2].
The status of this protocol is experimental, and this protocol is dependent upon TCP.
The protocol is for the server to be listening for a connection.
When a connection is opened the server sends a greeting message and waits for commands.
When commands are received the server acts on them and responds with replies.
The client opens a connection, waits for the greeting, then sends the USER and then the PASS commands to establish authorization to access mailboxes.
The client begins a mail reading transaction with either an RDEL (to read and delete all messages from a mailbox) or a RETR (to simply read all messages from a mailbox).
The server opens and locks the mailbox, and responds with the number of characters in the mailbox.
Then the client asks for the data to be sent by issuing the RCEV command.
The server responds by sending the mail data.
When all the data has been received the client sends the RCVD command.
If the transaction started with the RDEL command the server now deletes the mail data from the mailbox.
In any case, the server closes and unlocks the mailbox.
The client terminates the session with the QUIT command.

(go back to start) Definitions of Commands and Replies Summary of Commands and Replies Commands
This command identifies the user to the server.
It must be followed by the PASS command.
The PASS command carries the password authenticating this user.
Together the USER name and PASS password are used by the server to control access to the mailboxes.
This command begins a mail reading transaction.
The RETR command is used to read all the messages in a mailbox without deleting them.
It must be followed by the RCEV command.
This command begins a mail reading transaction.
The RDEL command is used to read all the messages in a mailbox and delete them.
It must be followed by the RCEV command.
This command confirms that the client is ready to receive the mail data.
It must be followed by the RCVD command.
This command confirms that the client has received and accepted the mail.
The RCVD command ends the mail reading transaction.
In the case of the RDEL transaction, it is possible that the mail is not necessarily deleted.
This is indicated by an error reply.
This command indicates the client is done with the session.
The server sends an OK response and then closes the connection.
This is the no operation command.
It causes no action on the part of the server except an OK response.
This command causes the server to abort the current transaction and return to waiting for a command (one of RDEL, RETR, QUIT, NOOP, or RSET).
When aborting a transaction the server must take care to properly close and unlock the mailbox.
