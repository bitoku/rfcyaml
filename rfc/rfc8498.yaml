  contents:
  - "Abstract\n   The P-Served-User header field was defined based on a requirement\n\
    \   from the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) IMS (IP Multimedia\n  \
    \ Subsystem) in order to convey the identity of the served user, his/\n   her\
    \ registration state, and the session case that applies to that\n   particular\
    \ communication session and application invocation.  A\n   session case is metadata\
    \ that captures the status of the session of a\n   served user regardless of whether\
    \ or not the served user is\n   registered or the session originates or terminates\
    \ with the served\n   user.  This document updates RFC 5502 by defining a new\
    \ P-Served-User\n   header field parameter, \"orig-cdiv\".  The parameter conveys\
    \ the\n   session case used by a proxy when handling an originating session\n\
    \   after Call Diversion (CDIV) services have been invoked for the served\n  \
    \ user.  This document also fixes the ABNF in RFC 5502 and provides\n   more guidance\

  - "1.1.  General\n   The P-Served-User header field [RFC5502] was defined based\
    \ on a\n   requirement from the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) IMS\n\
    \   (IP Multimedia Subsystem) in order to convey the identity of the\n   served\
    \ user, his/her registration state, and the session case between\n   a Serving\
    \ Call Session Control Function (S-CSCF) and an Application\n   Server (AS) on\
    \ the IMS Service Control (ISC) interface.  A session\n   case is metadata that\
    \ captures the status of the session of a served\n   user regardless of whether\
    \ or not the served user is registered or\n   the session originates or terminates\
    \ with the served user.  For more\n   information on session cases and the IMS,\
    \ a detailed description can\n   be found in [TS.3GPP.24.229].\n   [RFC5502] defines\
    \ the originating and terminating session cases for a\n   registered or unregistered\
    \ user.  This document extends the P-Served-\n   User header field to include\
    \ the session case for a forwarded leg\n   when both a CDIV service has been invoked\
    \ and an originating service\n   of the diverting user has to be triggered.\n\
    \   The sessioncase-param parameter of the P-Served-User header field is\n   extended\
    \ with the \"orig-cdiv\" parameter for this originating-after-\n   CDIV session\
    \ case.\n   The following section defines usage of the \"orig-cdiv\" parameter\
    \ of\n   the P-Served-User header field, Section 3 discusses the applicability\n\
    \   and scope of this new header field parameter, and Section 4 specifies\n  \
    \ the proxy behavior for handling the new header field parameter.\n   Section\
    \ 5 clarifies some of the [RFC5502] procedures, Section 6\n   describes the extended\
    \ syntax and corrects the syntax of [RFC5502],\n   Section 7 gives some call flow\
    \ examples, Section 8 registers the\n   P-Served-User header field parameters\
    \ with IANA, and Section 9\n   discusses the security properties of the environment\
    \ where this new\n   header field parameter is intended to be used.\n"
- title: 1.2.  Basic Use Case
  contents:
  - "1.2.  Basic Use Case\n   In the 3GPP IMS (IP Multimedia Subsystem), the S-CSCF\
    \ (Serving CSCF)\n   is a SIP proxy that serves as a registrar and handles originating\
    \ and\n   terminating session states for users assigned to it.  This means that\n\
    \   any call that is originated by a specific user or any call that is\n   terminated\
    \ to that specific user will pass through the S-CSCF that is\n   assigned to that\
    \ user.\n   At the moment that an S-CSCF is assigned to a specific user, the user\n\
    \   profile is downloaded from the Home Subscriber Server (HSS) to that\n   S-CSCF;\
    \ see [TS.3GPP.29.228].  The user profile contains the list of\n   actions to\
    \ be taken by the S-CSCF for the served user depending on\n   the session direction\
    \ (originating or terminating) and the user state\n   (registered or not) in the\
    \ IMS network.  With this user profile, the\n   S-CSCF determines the current\
    \ case and applies the corresponding\n   actions such as forwarding the request\
    \ to an AS.  The AS then goes\n   through a similar process of determining who\
    \ is the current served\n   user, what is his/her \"registration state\", and\
    \ what is the \"session\n   case\" of the session.  [RFC5502] defines all those\
    \ parameters and in\n   particular the originating and terminating session cases.\n\
    \   In basic call scenarios, there is no particular issue for the S-CSCF\n   and\
    \ AS to know which scenario needs to be realized, but in case of\n   CDIV services\
    \ for which the session is re-targeted, the session cases\n   defined in [RFC5502]\
    \ pose some limitations as described in the\n   following section.\n"
- title: 1.3.  Problem Statement
  contents:
  - "1.3.  Problem Statement\n   To illustrate the problem statement, let's imagine\
    \ Alice trying to\n   call Bob and Bob having a CDIV service activated towards\
    \ Carol's\n   address.  In the case of a CDIV service, the received request is\n\
    \   first treated as a terminating session case (at Bob's side), and the\n   terminating\
    \ filter criteria configured in the S-CSCF is performed.  A\n   filter criteria\
    \ is information in the user profile that determines\n   whether an initial request\
    \ is sent to a particular AS.  When the AS\n   receives the call initiation request,\
    \ the AS is able to determine the\n   served user (Bob) and the session case (here\
    \ \"term\") from the\n   received P-Served-User header field content and is able\
    \ to execute\n   terminating services.  When the CDIV service is executed (as\
    \ a\n   terminating service of Bob), the AS changes the target (Request-URI)\n\
    \   of the session (toward Carol's address) and a new call leg is\n   created.\
    \  The served user becomes the diverting user.  This new call\n   leg could be\
    \ considered as an originating call leg from the diverting\n   user (Bob), but\
    \ this is not the case.  Indeed, the originating user\n   remains the same (Alice),\
    \ and some of the diverting user's\n   originating services should not be triggered\
    \ as if it was an\n   originating call.  For instance, the originating user identity\n\
    \   (Alice) should not be restricted because the diverting user (Bob) has\n  \
    \ a privacy service for his own identity.  The privacy of the diverting\n   user\
    \ should apply to information related to this user only (e.g., in\n   the History-Info\
    \ header field).  In the same manner, some specific\n   services will need to\
    \ be triggered on the outgoing leg after a CDIV.\n   Without a dedicated session\
    \ case for originating-after-CDIV, the\n   S-CSCF cannot trigger an originating\
    \ service for the diverting user,\n   nor can an AS execute the procedures for\
    \ this particular session\n   case.\n   For this use case, this document creates\
    \ a new parameter\n   (\"orig-cdiv\") for the originating-after-CDIV session case\
    \ to be\n   embedded in the P-Served-User header field.\n"

    \   header field.  Nodes in such a Trust Domain explicitly trust each\n   other\
    \ to convey the served user and to be responsible for withholding\n   that information\
    \ outside of the Trust Domain.  The means by which the\n   network determines\
    \ the served user and the policies that are executed\n   for a specific served\
    \ user is outside the scope of this document.\n"
- title: 4.  Proxy Behavior and Parameter Handling
  contents:
  - "4.  Proxy Behavior and Parameter Handling\n   The following section illustrates\
    \ how this header field parameter can\n   be used in a 3GPP network.\n   For a\
    \ terminating call, the following steps will be followed:\n   1.  The S-CSCF receives\
    \ the initial INVITE request for a terminating\n       call and determines that\
    \ the session case is for a terminating\n       user as described in [RFC5502].\n\
    \   2.  The S-CSCF determines who is the served user by looking at the\n     \
    \  Request-URI and saves the current Request-URI.\n   3.  The S-CSCF analyzes\
    \ the filter criteria.  It then sends the\n       request to the AS of the served\
    \ user as an INVITE that includes\n       the P-Served-User header field with\
    \ the \"sescase\" parameter set\n       to \"term\" and the \"regstate\" set to\
    \ the corresponding value in\n       order to trigger execution of terminating\
    \ services.\n   4.  Based on some criteria, the AS concludes that the request\
    \ has to\n       be diverted to another target user or application.  The AS\n\
    \       replaces the received Request-URI with the new diverted-to\n       address\
    \ and stores the successive Request-URI(s) values by adding\n       one or two\
    \ History-Info header field entry(ies) [RFC7044] in the\n       outgoing INVITE.\
    \  In the History-Info header field, the served\n       user address is tagged\
    \ by using the mp-param header field\n       parameter added in the newly created\
    \ entry that contains the\n       diverted-to address.  The AS forwards the INVITE\
    \ request back to\n       the S-CSCF.\n   5.  When receiving back the INVITE request,\
    \ the S-CSCF can see that\n       the topmost Route header field contains its\
    \ own hostname, but the\n       Request-URI does not match the saved Request-URI.\
    \  In this case,\n       the S-CSCF updates the P-Served-User header field content\
    \ by\n       replacing the \"sescase\" parameter with the \"orig-cdiv\" parameter.\n\
    \       The P-Served-User header field value remains unchanged.\n   6.  The S-CSCF\
    \ forwards the INVITE request to an AS that hosts the\n       served user's (diverting\
    \ user's) originating services, which need\n       to be executed on the forwarded\
    \ leg after a CDIV service.\n   7.  When the AS receives the INVITE request, it\
    \ determines that the\n       session case is for the \"orig-cdiv\" session case\
    \ and performs the\n       originating services to be executed after retargeting\
    \ for the\n       diverting user (i.e., served user).\n"
- title: 5.  Clarification of RFC 5502 Procedures
  contents:
  - "5.  Clarification of RFC 5502 Procedures\n   This document provides the following\
    \ guidance for the handling of the\n   P-Served-User header field that is missing\
    \ in [RFC5502]:\n   o  The P-Served-User header field MUST NOT be repeated within\
    \ a\n      request for a particular session at a particular time for the\n   \
    \   reason that session cases are mutually exclusive.  This document\n      updates\
    \ [RFC5502] to clearly state that the P-Served-User header\n      field MUST NOT\
    \ contain multiple values either comma-separated or\n      header-separated. \
    \ This document also updates the syntax of the\n      header from [RFC5502] to\
    \ reflect this uniqueness of parameter\n      values.\n   o  [RFC5502] does not\
    \ clearly state what to do with the received\n      P-Served-User header field\
    \ when a call is diverted to another\n      destination.  This document highlights\
    \ that there are several ways\n      of handling the P-Served-User header field:\
    \ the S-CSCF could store\n      the previous \"regstate\" value and decide that\
    \ the same value\n      applies, the \"regstate\" may no longer be relevant after\
    \ a\n      diverting service so the S-CSCF removes it, or the \"regstate\"\n \
    \     could be combined with the \"orig-cdiv\" session case to provide\n     \
    \ different services depending on whether the served user is\n      registered\
    \ or unregistered.  These choices are implementation\n      dependent.\n"
