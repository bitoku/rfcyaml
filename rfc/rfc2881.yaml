- title: 1. Introduction
  contents:
  - "1. Introduction\n   A Network Access Server is the initial entry point to a network\
    \ for\n   the majority of users of network services.  It is the first device in\n\
    \   the network to provide services to an end user, and acts as a gateway\n  \
    \ for all further services.  As such, its importance to users and\n   service\
    \ providers alike is paramount.  However, the concept of a\n   Network Access\
    \ Server has grown up over the years without being\n   formally defined or analyzed\
    \ [4].\n"
- title: 1.1 Scope of this Document
  contents:
  - "1.1 Scope of this Document\n   There are several tradeoffs taken in this document.\
    \  The purpose of\n   this document is to describe a model for evaluating NAS\
    \ service\n   protocols.  It will give examples of typical NAS hardware and\n\
    \   software features, but these are not to be taken as hard limitations\n   of\
    \ the model, but merely illustrative of the points of discussion.\n   An important\
    \ goal of the model is to offer a framework that allows\n   further development\
    \ and expansion of capabilities in NAS\n   implementation.\n   As with most IETF\
    \ projects, the focus is on standardizing the\n   protocol interaction between\
    \ the components of the system.  The\n   documents produced will not address the\
    \ following areas:\n   - AAA server back-end implementation is abstracted and\
    \ not\n     prescribed.  The actual organization of the data in the server, its\n\
    \     internal interfaces, and capabilities are left to the\n     implementation.\n\
    \   - NAS front-end call technology is not assumed to be static.\n     Alternate\
    \ and new technology will be accommodated.  The resultant\n     protocol specifications\
    \ must be flexible in design to allow for new\n     technologies and services\
    \ to be added with minimal impact on\n     existing implementations.\n"
- title: 1.2 Specific Terminology
  contents:
  - "1.2 Specific Terminology\n   The following terms are used in this document in\
    \ this manner:  A\n   \"Call\" - the initiation of a network service request to\
    \ the NAS.\n   This can mean the arrival of a telephone call via a dial-in or\n\
    \   switched telephone network connection, or the creation of a tunnel to\n  \
    \ a tunnel server which becomes a virtual NAS.  A \"Session\" - is the\n   NAS\
    \ provided service to a specific authorized user entity.\n"
- title: 2. Network Access System Equipment Assumptions
  contents:
  - "2. Network Access System Equipment Assumptions\n   A typical hardware-based NAS\
    \ is implemented in a constrained system.\n   It is important that the NAS protocols\
    \ don't assume unlimited\n   resources on the part of the platform.  The following\
    \ are typical\n   constraints:\n   - A computer system of minimal to moderate\
    \ performance\n     (example processors: Intel 386 or 486, Motorola 68000)\n \
    \  - A moderate amount, but not large RAM (typically varies with\n     supported\
    \ # of ports 1MB to 8MB)\n   - Some small amount of non-volatile memory, and/or\
    \ way to be\n     configured out-of-band\n   - No assumption of a local file system\
    \ or disk storage\n   A NAS system may consist of a system of interconnected specialized\n\
    \   processor system units.  Typically they may be circuit boards (or\n   blades)\
    \ that are arrayed in a card cage (or chassis) and referred to\n   by their position\
    \ (i.e., slot number).  The bus interconnection\n   methods are typically proprietary\
    \ and will not be addressed here.\n   A NAS is sometimes referred to as a Remote\
    \ Access Server (RAS) as it\n   typically allows remote access to a network. \
    \ However, a more general\n   picture is that of an \"Edge Server\", where the\
    \ NAS sits on the edge\n   of an IP network of some type, and allows dynamic access\
    \ to it.\n   Such systems typically have;\n   - At least one LAN or high performance\
    \ network interface (e.g.,\n     Ethernet, ATM, FR)\n   - At least one, but typically\
    \ many, serial interface ports, which\n     could be;\n     -  serial RS232 ports\
    \ direct wired or wired to a modem, or\n     -  have integral hardware or software\
    \ modems (V.22bis,V.32, V.34,\n        X2, Kflex, V.90, etc.)\n     -  have direct\
    \ connections to telephone network digital WAN lines\n        (ISDN, T1, T3, NFAS,\
    \ or SS7)\n     -  an aggregation of xDSL connections or PPPoe sessions [5].\n\
    \   However, systems may perform some of the functions of a NAS, but not\n   have\
    \ these kinds of hardware characteristics.  An example would be a\n   industry\
    \ personal computer server system, that has several modem line\n   connections.\
    \  These lines will be managed like a dedicated NAS, but\n   the system itself\
    \ is a general file server.  Likewise, with the\n   development of tunneling protocols\
    \ (L2F [6], ATMP [7], L2TP [8]),\n   tunnel server systems must behave like a\
    \ \"virtual\" NAS, where the\n   calls come from the network tunneled sessions\
    \ and not hardware ports\n   ([11], [9], [10]).\n"
- title: 3. NAS Services
  contents:
  - "3. NAS Services\n   The core of what a NAS provides, are dynamic network services.\
    \  What\n   distinguishes a NAS from a typical routing system, is that these\n\
    \   services are provided on a per-user basis, based on an authentication\n  \
    \ and the service is accounted for.  This accounting may lead to\n   policies\
    \ and controls to limit appropriate usage to levels based on\n   the availability\
    \ of network bandwidth, or service agreements between\n   the user and the provider.\n\
    \   Typical services include:\n   - dial-up or direct access serial line access;\
    \ Ability to access the\n     network using a the public telephone network.\n\
    \   - network access (SLIP, PPP, IPX, NETBEUI, ARAP); The NAS allows the\n   \
    \  caller to access the network directly.\n   - asynchronous terminal services\
    \ (Telnet, Rlogin, LAT, others); The\n     NAS implements the network protocol\
    \ on behalf of the caller, and\n     presents a terminal interface.\n   - dial-out\
    \ connections; Ability to cause the NAS to initiate a\n     connection over the\
    \ public telephone network, typically based on the\n     arrival of traffic to\
    \ a specific network system.\n   - callback (NAS generates call to caller); Ability\
    \ to cause the NAS to\n     reverse or initiate a network connection based on\
    \ the arrival of a\n     dial-in call.\n   - tunneling (from access connection\
    \ to remote server); The NAS\n     transports the callers network packets over\
    \ a network to a remote\n     server using an encapsulation protocol. (L2TP [8],\
    \ RADIUS support\n     [11])\n"
- title: 4. Authentication, Authorization and Accounting (AAA) Servers
  contents:
  - "4. Authentication, Authorization and Accounting (AAA) Servers\n   Because of\
    \ the need to authenticate and account, and for practical\n   reasons of implementation,\
    \ NAS systems have come to depend on\n   external server systems to implement\
    \ authentication databases and\n   accounting recording.\n   By separating these\
    \ functions from the NAS equipment, they can be\n   implemented in general purpose\
    \ computer systems, that may provide\n   better suited long term storage media,\
    \ and more sophisticated\n   database software infrastructures.  Not to mention\
    \ that a centralized\n   server can allow the coordinated administration of many\
    \ NAS systems\n   as appropriate (for example a single server may service an entire\
    \ POP\n   consisting of multiple NAS systems).\n   For ease of management, there\
    \ is a strong desire to piggyback NAS\n   authentication information with other\
    \ authentication databases, so\n   that authentication information can be managed\
    \ for several services\n   (such as OS shell login, or Web Server access) from\
    \ the same\n   provider, without creating separate passwords and accounts for\
    \ the\n   user.\n   Session activity information is stored and processed to produce\n\
    \   accounting usage records.  This is typically done with a long term\n   (nightly,\
    \ weekly or monthly) batch type process.\n   However, as network operations grow\
    \ in sophistication, there are\n   requirements to provide real-time monitoring\
    \ of port and user status,\n   so that the state information can be used to implement\
    \ policy\n   decisions, monitor user trends, and the ability to possibly terminate\n\
    \   access for administrative reasons.  Typically only the NAS knows the\n   true\
    \ dynamic state of a session.\n"

- title: '5.1 Characteristics of Systems and Sessions:'
  contents:
  - "5.1 Characteristics of Systems and Sessions:\n   Sessions must have a user identifier\
    \ and authenticator to complete\n   the authentication process. Accounting starts\
    \ from time of call or\n   service, though finer details are allowed. At the end\
    \ of service, the\n   call may be disconnected or allow re-authentication for\
    \ additional\n   services.\n   Some systems allow decisions on call handling to\
    \ be made based on\n   telephone system information provided before the call is\
    \ answered\n   (e.g., caller id or destination number). In such systems, calls\
    \ may\n   be busied-out or non-answered if system resources are not ready or\n\
    \   available.\n   Authorization to run services are supplied and applied after\n\
    \   authentication. A NAS may abort call if session authorization\n   information\
    \ disagrees with call characteristics. Some system\n   resources may be controlled\
    \ by server driven policies\n   Accounting messages are sent to the accounting\
    \ server when service\n   begins, and ends, and possibly periodically during service\
    \ delivery.\n   Accounting is not necessarily a real-time service, the NAS may\
    \ be\n   queue and batch send event records.\n"
- title: 5.2 Separation of NAS and AAA server functions
  contents:
  - "5.2 Separation of NAS and AAA server functions\n   As a distributed system, there\
    \ is a separation of roles between the\n   NAS and the Server:\n     - Server\
    \ provides authentication services; checks passwords\n       (static or dynamic)\n\
    \     - Server databases may be organized in any way (only protocol\n       specified)\n\

- title: 5.3 Network Management and Administrative features
  contents:
  - "5.3 Network Management and Administrative features\n   The NAS system is presumed\
    \ to have a method of configuration that\n   allows it to know it's identity and\
    \ network parameters at boot time.\n   Likewise, this configuration information\
    \ is typically managed using\n   the standard management protocols (e.g., SNMP).\
    \  This would include\n   the configuration of the parameters necessary to contact\
    \ the AAA\n   server itself.  The purpose of the AAA server is not to provide\n\
    \   network management for the NAS, but to authorize and characterize the\n  \
    \ individual services for the users.  Therefore any feature that can be\n   user\
    \ specific is open to supply from the AAA server.\n   The system may have other\
    \ operational services that are used to run\n   and control the NAS.  Some users\
    \ that have _Administrative_\n   privileges may have access to system configuration\
    \ tools, or services\n   that affect the operation and configuration of the system\
    \ (e.g.,\n   loading boot images, internal file system access, etc..)  Access\
    \ to\n   these facilities may also be authenticated by the AAA server\n   (provided\
    \ it is configured and reachable!) and levels of access\n   authorization may\
    \ be provided.\n"
- title: 6. Authentication Methods
  contents:
  - "6. Authentication Methods\n   A NAS system typically supports a number of authentication\
    \ systems.\n   For async terminal users, these may be a simple as a prompt and\n\
    \   input.  For network datalink users, such as PPP, several different\n   authentication\
    \ methods will be supported (PAP, CHAP [12], MS-CHAP\n   [13]).  Some of these\
    \ may actually be protocols in and of themselves\n   (EAP [14] [15], and Kerberos).\n\
    \   Additionally, the content of the authentication exchanges may not be\n   straightforward.\
    \  Hard token cards, such as the Safeword and SecurId,\n   systems may generate\
    \ one-time passphrases that must be validated\n   against a proprietary server.\
    \  In the case of multi-link support, it\n   may be necessary to remember a session\
    \ token or certificate for the\n   later authentication of additional links.\n\
    \   In the cases of VPN and compulsory tunneling services, typically a\n   Network\
    \ Access Identifier (RFC 2486 [16]) is presented by the user.\n   This NAI is\
    \ parsed into a destination network identifier either by\n   the NAS or by the\
    \ AAA server.  The authentication information will\n   typically not be validated\
    \ locally, but by a AAA service at the\n   remote end of the tunnel service.\n"
- title: 7. Session Authorization Information
  contents:
  - "7. Session Authorization Information\n   Once a user has been authenticated,\
    \ there are a number of individual\n   bits of information that the network management\
    \ may wish to configure\n   and authorize for the given user or class of users.\n\
    \   Typical examples include:\n        For async terminal users:\n        - banners\n\
    \        - custom prompts\n        - menus\n        - CLI macros - which could\
    \ be used for: shortcuts, compound\n          commands, restrictive scripts\n\
    \        For network users:\n        - addresses, and routes\n        - callback\
    \ instructions\n        - packet and activity filters\n        - network server\
    \ addresses\n        - host server addresses\n   Some services may require dynamic\
    \ allocation of resources.\n   Information about the resources required may not\
    \ be known during the\n   authentication phase, it may come up later. (e.g., IP\
    \ Addresses for\n   multi-link bundles) It's also possible that the authorization\
    \ will\n   change over the time of the session. To provide these there has to\
    \ be\n   a division of responsibility between the NAS and the AAA server, or a\n\
    \   cooperation using a stateful service.\n   Such services include:\n       \
    \ - IP Address management\n        - Concurrent login limitations\n        - Tunnel\
    \ usage limitations\n        - Real-time account expirations\n        - Call management\
    \ policies\n   In the process of resolving resource information, it may be required\n\
    \   that a certain level of service be supplied, and if not available,\n   the\
    \ request refused, or corrective action taken.\n"
- title: 8. IP Network Interaction
  contents:
  - "8. IP Network Interaction\n   As the NAS participates in the IP network, it interacts\
    \ with the\n   routing mechanisms of the network itself.  These interactions may\n\
    \   also be controlled on a per-user/session basis.\n   For example, some input\
    \ streams may be directed to specific hosts\n   other than the default gateway\
    \ for the destination subnet.  In order\n   to control services within the network\
    \ provider's infrastructure,\n   some types of packets may be discarded (filtered)\
    \ before entering the\n   network.  These filters could be applied based on examination\
    \ of\n   destination address and port number.  Anti-spoofing packet controls\n\
    \   may be applied to disallow traffic sourced from addresses other than\n   what\
    \ was assigned to the port.\n   A NAS may also be an edge router system, and apply\
    \ Quality of Service\n   (QoS) policies to the packets.  This makes it a QOS Policy\n\
    \   Enforcement Point [19], [17].  It may learn QOS and other network\n   policies\
    \ for the user via the AAA service.\n"
- title: 9. A NAS Model
  contents:
  - "9. A NAS Model\n   So far we have looked at examples of things that NASes do.\
    \  The\n   following attempts to define a NAS model that captures the\n   fundamentals\
    \ of NAS structure to better categorize how it interacts\n   with other network\
    \ components.\n   A Network Access Server is a device which sits on the edge of\
    \ a\n   network, and provides access to services on that network in a\n   controlled\
    \ fashion, based on the identity of the user of the network\n   services in question\
    \ and on the policy of the provider of these\n   services.  For the purposes of\
    \ this document, a Network Access Server\n   is defined primarily as a device\
    \ which accepts multiple point-to-\n   point [18] links on one set of interfaces,\
    \ providing access to a\n   routed network or networks on another set of interfaces.\n\
    \   Note that there are many things that a Network Access Server is not.\n   A\
    \ NAS is not simply a router, although it will typically include\n   routing functionality\
    \ in it's interface to the network.  A NAS is not\n   necessarily a dial access\
    \ server, although dial access is one common\n   means of network access, and\
    \ brings its own particular set of\n   requirements to NAS's.\n   A NAS is the\
    \ first device in the IP network to provide services to an\n   end user, and acts\
    \ as a gateway for all further services.  It is the\n   point at which users are\
    \ authenticated, access policy is enforced,\n   network services are authorized,\
    \ network usage is audited, and\n   resource consumption is tracked.  That is,\
    \ a NAS often acts as the\n   policy enforcement point for network AAAA (authentication,\n\
    \   authorization, accounting, and auditing) services.  A NAS is\n   typically\
    \ the first place in a network where security measures and\n   policy may be implemented.\n"

- title: 9.2 Terminology
  contents:
  - "9.2 Terminology\n   Following is a description of the modules and interfaces\
    \ in the\n   reference model for a NAS given above:\n   Client Interfaces - A\
    \ NAS has one or more client interfaces, which\n      provide the interface to\
    \ the end users who are requesting network\n      access.  Users may connect to\
    \ these client interfaces via modems\n      over a PSTN, or via tunnels over a\
    \ data network.  Two broad\n      classes of NAS's may be defined, based on the\
    \ nature of the\n      incoming client interfaces, as follows. Note that a single\
    \ NAS\n      device may serve in both classes:\n   Dial Access Servers - A Dial\
    \ Access Server is a NAS whose client\n      interfaces consist of modems, either\
    \ local or remote, which are\n      attached to a PSTN.\n   Tunnel Servers - A\
    \ Tunnel Server is a NAS whose client interfaces\n      consists of tunneling\
    \ endpoints in a protocol such as L2TP\n   Network Interfaces - A NAS has one\
    \ or more network interfaces, which\n      connect to the networks to which access\
    \ is being granted.\n   Routing - If the network to which access is being granted\
    \ is a routed\n      network, then a NAS will typically include routing functionality.\n\
    \   Policy Management Interface - A NAS provides an interface which\n      allows\
    \ access to network services to be managed on a per-user\n      basis. This interface\
    \ may be a configuration file, a graphical\n      user interface, an API, or a\
    \ protocol such as RADIUS, Diameter, or\n      COPS [19].  This interface provides\
    \ a mechanism for granular\n      resource management and policy enforcement.\n\
    \   Authentication - Authentication refers to the confirmation that a\n      user\
    \ who is requesting services is a valid user of the network\n      services requested.\
    \  Authentication is accomplished via the\n      presentation of an identity and\
    \ credentials.  Examples of types of\n      credentials are passwords, one-time\
    \ tokens, digital certificates,\n      and phone numbers (calling/called).\n \
    \  Authorization - Authorization refers to the granting of specific\n      types\
    \ of service (including \"no service\") to a user, based on\n      their authentication,\
    \ what services they are requesting, and the\n      current system state.  Authorization\
    \ may be based on restrictions,\n      for example time-of-day restrictions, or\
    \ physical location\n      restrictions, or restrictions against multiple logins\
    \ by the same\n      user.  Authorization determines the nature of the service\
    \ which is\n      granted to a user.  Examples of types of service include, but\
    \ are\n      not limited to: IP address filtering, address assignment, route\n\
    \      assignment, QoS/differential services, bandwidth control/traffic\n    \
    \  management, compulsory tunneling to a specific endpoint, and\n      encryption.\n\
    \   Accounting - Accounting refers to the tracking of the consumption of\n   \
    \   NAS resources by users. This information may be used for\n      management,\
    \ planning, billing, or other purposes.  Real-time\n      accounting refers to\
    \ accounting information that is delivered\n      concurrently with the consumption\
    \ of the resources.  Batch\n      accounting refers to accounting information\
    \ that is saved until it\n      is delivered at a later time.  Typical information\
    \ that is\n      gathered in accounting is the identity of the user, the nature\
    \ of\n      the service delivered, when the service began, and when it ended.\n\
    \   Auditing - Auditing refers to the tracking of activity by users.  As\n   \
    \   opposed to accounting, where the purpose is to track consumption\n      of\
    \ resources, the purpose of auditing is to determine the nature\n      of a user's\
    \ network activity.  Examples of auditing information\n      include the identity\
    \ of the user, the nature of the services used,\n      what hosts were accessed\
    \ when, what protocols were used, etc.\n   AAAA Server - An AAAA Server is a server\
    \ or servers that provide\n      authentication, authorization, accounting, and\
    \ auditing services.\n      These may be co-located with the NAS, or more typically,\
    \ are\n      located on a separate server and communicate with the NAS's User\n\
    \      Management Interface via an AAAA protocol.  The four AAAA\n      functions\
    \ may be located on a single server, or may be broken up\n      among multiple\
    \ servers.\n   Device Management Interface - A NAS is a network device which is\n\
    \      owned, operated, and managed by some entity.  This interface\n      provides\
    \ a means for this entity to operate and manage the NAS.\n      This interface\
    \ may be a configuration file, a graphical user\n      interface, an API, or a\
    \ protocol such as SNMP [20].\n   Device Monitoring - Device monitoring refers\
    \ to the tracking of\n      status, activity, and usage of the NAS as a network\
    \ device.\n   Device Provisioning - Device provisioning refers to the\n      configurations,\
    \ settings, and control of the NAS as a network\n      device.\n"
- title: 9.3 Analysis
  contents:
  - "9.3 Analysis\n   Following is an analysis of the functions of a NAS using the\n\
    \   reference model above:\n"
- title: 9.3.1 Authentication and Security
  contents:
  - "9.3.1 Authentication and Security\n   NAS's serve as the first point of authentication\
    \ for network users,\n   providing security to user sessions.  This security is\
    \ typically\n   performed by checking credentials such as a PPP PAP user\n   name/password\
    \ pair or a PPP CHAP user name and challenge/response,\n   but may be extended\
    \ to authentication via telephone number\n   information, digital certificates,\
    \ or biometrics.  NAS's also may\n   authenticate themselves to users.  Since\
    \ a NAS may be shared among\n   multiple administrative entities, authentication\
    \ may actually be\n   performed via a back-end proxy, referral, or brokering process.\n\
    \   In addition to user security, NAS's may themselves be operated as\n   secure\
    \ devices.  This may include secure methods of management and\n   monitoring,\
    \ use of IP Security [21] and even participation in a\n   Public Key Infrastructure.\n"
- title: 9.3.2 Authorization and Policy
  contents:
  - "9.3.2 Authorization and Policy\n   NAS's are the first point of authorization\
    \ for usage of network\n   resources, and NAS's serve as policy enforcement points\
    \ for the\n   services that they deliver to users.  NAS's may provision these\n\
    \   services to users in a statically or dynamically configured fashion.\n   Resource\
    \ management can be performed at a NAS by granting specific\n   types of service\
    \ based on the current network state.  In the case of\n   shared operation, NAS\
    \ policy may be determined based on the policy of\n   multiple end systems.\n"
- title: 9.3.3 Accounting and Auditing
  contents:
  - "9.3.3 Accounting and Auditing\n   Since NAS services are consumable resources,\
    \ usage information must\n   often be collected for the purposes of soft policy\
    \ management,\n   reporting, planning, and accounting.  A dynamic, real-time view\
    \ of\n   NAS usage is often required for network auditing purposes.  Since a\n\
    \   NAS may be shared among multiple administrative entities, usage\n   information\
    \ must often be delivered to multiple endpoints.\n   Accounting is performed using\
    \ such protocols as RADIUS [2].\n"
- title: 9.3.4 Resource Management
  contents:
  - "9.3.4 Resource Management\n   NAS's deliver resources to users, often in a dynamic\
    \ fashion.\n   Examples of the types of resources doled out by NAS's are IP\n\
    \   addresses, network names and name server identities, tunnels, and\n   PSTN\
    \ resources such as phone lines and numbers.  Note that NAS's may\n   be operated\
    \ in a outsourcing model, where multiple entities are\n   competing for the same\
    \ resources.\n"
- title: 9.3.5 Virtual Private Networks (VPN's)
  contents:
  - "9.3.5 Virtual Private Networks (VPN's)\n   NAS's often participate in VPN's,\
    \ and may serve as the means by which\n   VPN's are implemented.  Examples of\
    \ the use of NAS's in VPN's are:\n   Dial Access Servers that build compulsory\
    \ tunnels, Dial Access\n   Servers that provide services to voluntary tunnelers,\
    \ and Tunnel\n   Servers that provide tunnel termination services.  NAS's may\n\
    \   simultaneously provide VPN and public network services to different\n   users,\
    \ based on policy and user identity.\n"
- title: 9.3.6 Service Quality
  contents:
  - "9.3.6 Service Quality\n   A NAS may delivery different qualities, types, or levels\
    \ of service\n   to different users based on policy and identity.  NAS's may perform\n\
    \   bandwidth management, allow differential speeds or methods of access,\n  \
    \ or even participate in provisioned or signaled Quality of Service\n   (QoS)\
    \ networks.\n"
- title: 9.3.7 Roaming
  contents:
  - "9.3.7 Roaming\n   NAS's are often operated in a shared or outsourced manner,\
    \ or a NAS\n   operator may enter into agreements with other service providers\
    \ to\n   grant access to users from these providers (roaming operations).\n  \
    \ NAS's often are operated as part of a global network.  All these\n   imply that\
    \ a NAS often provides services to users from multiple\n   administrative domains\
    \ simultaneously.  The features of NAS's may\n   therefore be driven by requirements\
    \ of roaming [22].\n"
- title: 10. Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "10. Security Considerations\n   This document describes a model not a particular\
    \ solution.\n   As mentioned in section 9.3.1 and elsewhere, NAS'es are concerned\n\
    \   about the security of several aspects of their operation, including:\n   \
    \   - Providing sufficiently robust authentication techniques as\n        required\
    \ by network policies,\n      - NAS authentication of configured authentication\
    \ server(s),\n      - Server ability to authenticate configured clients,\n   \
    \   - Hiding of the authentication information from network snooping\n       \
    \ to protect from attacks and provide user privacy,\n      - Protecting the integrity\
    \ of message exchanges from attacks\n        such as; replay, or man-in-the middle,\n\
    \      - Inability of other hosts to interfere with services authorized\n    \
    \    to NAS, or gain unauthorized services,\n      - Inability of other hosts\
    \ to probe or guess at authentication\n        information.\n      - Protection\
    \ of NAS system configuration and administration from\n        unauthorized users\n\
    \      - Protection of the network from illegal packets sourced by\n        accessing\
    \ connections\n"
