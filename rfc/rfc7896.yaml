  - "Abstract\n   The Path Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCEP) enables\n\
    \   communications between a Path Computation Client (PCC) and a PCE, or\n   between\
    \ two PCEs.  RFC 5440 defines the Include Route Object (IRO) to\n   specify network\
    \ elements to be traversed in the computed path.  The\n   specification does not\
    \ specify if the IRO contains an ordered or\n   unordered list of subobjects.\
    \  During recent discussions, it was\n   determined that there was a need to define\
    \ a standard representation\n   to ensure interoperability.  It was also noted\
    \ that there is a\n   benefit in the handling of an attribute of the IRO's subobject,\
    \ the L\n   bit.\n   This document updates RFC 5440 regarding the IRO specification.\n"

  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   The Path Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCEP)\
    \ enables\n   communications between a Path Computation Client (PCC) and a PCE,\
    \ or\n   between two PCEs.  [RFC5440] defines the Include Route Object (IRO)\n\
    \   to specify network elements to be traversed in the computed path.\n   The\
    \ specification does not specify if the IRO is an ordered or\n   unordered list\
    \ of subobjects.  In addition, it defines the L bit as\n   having no meaning within\
    \ an IRO.\n   [RFC5441] describes the use of an IRO to indicate the sequence of\n\
    \   domains to be traversed during inter-domain path computation.\n   During recent\
    \ discussions, it was determined that there was a need to\n   define a standard\
    \ representation to ensure interoperability.\n   This document updates the IRO\
    \ specifications in Section 7.12 of\n   [RFC5440].\n"
- title: 2.  Update in the IRO Specification
  contents:
  - "2.  Update in the IRO Specification\n   Section 7.12 of [RFC5440] describes the\
    \ IRO as an optional object\n   used to specify a set of network elements to be\
    \ traversed in the\n   computed path.  It states that the L bit in the subobject\
    \ has no\n   meaning within an IRO.  It does not mention if the IRO contains an\n\
    \   ordered or unordered list of subobjects.\n"
- title: 2.1.  Update to RFC 5440
  contents:
  - "2.1.  Update to RFC 5440\n   The IRO specification is updated to remove the last\
    \ line in the\n   Section 7.12 of [RFC5440], which states:\n       \"The L bit\
    \ of such sub-object has no meaning within an IRO.\"\n   Further, Section 7.12\
    \ of [RFC5440] is updated to add the following\n   two statements at the end of\
    \ the first paragraph.\n   -  The content of an IRO is an ordered list of subobjects\n\
    \      representing a series of abstract nodes (refer to Section 4.3.2 of\n  \
    \    [RFC3209]).\n   -  The L bit of an IRO subobject is set based on the loose\
    \ or strict\n      hop property of the subobject; it is set if the subobject\n\
    \      represents a loose hop.  If the bit is not set, the subobject\n      represents\
    \ a strict hop.  The interpretation of the L bit is as\n      per Section 4.3.3.1\
    \ of [RFC3209].\n"
- title: 3.  Operational Considerations
  contents:
  - "3.  Operational Considerations\n   Because of the lack of clarity in [RFC5440],\
    \ it is possible to\n   encounter implementations that always interpret the IRO\
    \ subobjects as\n   loose.  When these implementations interwork with an implementation\n\
    \   conforming to this document, the following impact might be seen:\n   o  If\
    \ a non-conforming (to this document) PCC sends an IRO to a\n      conforming\
    \ (to this document) PCE, then the PCE may unexpectedly\n      fail to find a\
    \ path (since the PCC may think of the IRO subobjects\n      as loose hops, but\
    \ the PCE interprets them as strict hops).\n   o  If a conforming PCC sends an\
    \ IRO containing strict hops to a non-\n      conforming PCE, then the PCE may\
    \ erroneously return a path that\n      does not comply with the requested strict\
    \ hops (since the PCE\n      interprets them all as loose hops).  The PCC may\
    \ check the\n      returned path and find the issue, or it may end up using an\n\
    \      incorrect path.\n"
- title: 4.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "4.  Security Considerations\n   This update in the IRO specification does not\
    \ introduce any new\n   security considerations, apart from those mentioned in\
    \ [RFC5440].\n   Clarification in the supported IRO ordering or Loose hop bit\
    \ handling\n   will not have any negative security impact.\n   It is worth noting\
    \ that PCEP operates over TCP.  An analysis of the\n   security issues for routing\
    \ protocols that use TCP (including PCEP)\n   is provided in [RFC6952].\n"
