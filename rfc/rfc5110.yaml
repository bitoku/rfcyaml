    \ that were never widely deployed or have fallen into\n   disuse.  A companion\
    \ document [ADDRARCH] describes multicast\n   addressing architectures.\n   Specifically,\
    \ this memo deals with:\n   o  setting up multicast forwarding state (Section\

    \ o  learning active sources (Section 2.3),\n   o  configuring and distributing\
    \ the rendezvous point (RP) information\n      (Section 2.4),\n   o  mechanisms\
    \ for enhanced redundancy (Section 2.5),\n   o  interacting with hosts (Section\
    \ 2.6), and\n   o  restricting the multicast flooding in the link layer\n    \
    \  (Section 2.7).\n   Section 2 starts by describing a simplistic example how\
    \ these classes\n   of mechanisms fit together.  Some multicast data transport\

- title: 2.  Multicast Routing
  contents:
  - "2.  Multicast Routing\n   In order to give a simplified summary how each of these\
    \ class of\n   mechanisms fits together, consider the following multicast receiver\n\
    \   scenario.\n   Certain protocols and configurations need to be in place before\n\
    \   multicast routing can work.  Specifically, when ASM is employed, a\n   router\
    \ will need to know its RP address(es) (Section 2.4,\n   Section 2.5).  With IPv4,\
    \ RPs need to be connected to other RPs using\n   MSDP so information about sources\
    \ connected to other RPs can be\n   distributed (Section 2.3).  Further, routers\
    \ need to know if or how\n   multicast topology differs from unicast topology,\
    \ and routing\n   protocol extensions can provide that information (Section 2.2).\n\
    \   When a host wants to receive a transmission, it first needs to find\n   out\
    \ the multicast group address (and with SSM, source address) using\n   various\
    \ means (e.g., SDP description file [RFC4566] or manually).\n   Then it will signal\
    \ its interest to its first-hop router using IGMP\n   (IPv4) or MLD (IPv6) (Section\
    \ 2.6).  The router initiates setting up\n   hop-by-hop multicast forwarding state\
    \ (Section 2.1) to the source (in\n   SSM) or first through the RP (in ASM). \
    \ Routers use an RP to find out\n   all the sources for a group (Section 2.3).\
    \  When multicast\n   transmission arrives at the receiver's LAN, it is flooded\
    \ to every\n   Ethernet switch port unless flooding reduction such as IGMP snooping\n\
    \   is employed (Section 2.7).\n"
- title: 2.1.  Setting up Multicast Forwarding State
  contents:
  - "2.1.  Setting up Multicast Forwarding State\n   The most important part of multicast\
    \ routing is setting up the\n   multicast forwarding state.  State maintenance\
    \ requires periodic\n   messaging because forwarding state has a timeout.  This\
    \ section\n   describes the protocols commonly used for this purpose.\n"
- title: 2.1.1.  PIM-SM
  contents:
  - "2.1.1.  PIM-SM\n   By far, the most common multicast routing protocol is PIM-SM\n\
    \   [RFC4601].  The PIM-SM protocol includes both Any Source Multicast\n   (ASM)\
    \ and Source-Specific Multicast (SSM) functionality.  PIM-SSM is\n   a subset\
    \ of PIM-SM that does not use the RPs but instead requires\n   that receivers\
    \ know the (source,group) pair and signal that\n   explicitly.  Most current routing\
    \ platforms support PIM-SM.\n   PIM routers elect a designated router on each\
    \ LAN and the DR is\n   responsible for PIM messaging and source registration\
    \ on behalf of\n   the hosts.  The DR encapsulates multicast packets sourced from\
    \ the\n   LAN in a unicast tunnel to the RP.  PIM-SM builds a unidirectional,\n\
    \   group-specific distribution tree consisting of the interested\n   receivers\
    \ of a group.  Initially, the multicast distribution tree is\n   rooted at the\
    \ RP but later the DRs have the option of optimizing the\n   delivery by building\
    \ (source,group)-specific trees.\n   A more lengthy introduction to PIM-SM can\
    \ be found in Section 3 of\n   [RFC4601].\n"
- title: 2.1.2.  PIM-DM
  contents:
  - "2.1.2.  PIM-DM\n   Whereas PIM-SM has been designed to avoid unnecessary flooding\
    \ of\n   multicast data, PIM-DM [RFC3973] assumed that almost every subnet at\n\
    \   a site had at least one receiver for a group.  PIM-DM floods\n   multicast\
    \ transmissions throughout the network (\"flood and prune\")\n   unless the leaf\
    \ parts of the network periodically indicate that they\n   are not interested\
    \ in that particular group.\n   PIM-DM may be an acceptable fit in small and/or\
    \ simple networks,\n   where setting up an RP would be unnecessary, and possibly\
    \ in cases\n   where a large percentage of users are expected to want to receive\
    \ the\n   transmission so that the amount of state the network has to keep is\n\
    \   minimal.\n   PIM-DM was used as a first step in transitioning away from DVMRP.\
    \  It\n   also became apparent that most networks would not have receivers for\n\
    \   most groups, and to avoid the bandwidth and state overhead, the\n   flooding\
    \ paradigm was gradually abandoned.  Transitioning from PIM-DM\n   to PIM-SM was\
    \ easy as PIM-SM was designed to use compatible packet\n   formats and dense-mode\
    \ operation could also be satisfied by a sparse\n   protocol.  PIM-DM is no longer\
    \ in widespread use.\n   Many implementations also support so-called \"sparse-dense\"\
    \n   configuration, where Sparse mode is used by default, but Dense is\n   used\
    \ for configured multicast group ranges (such as Auto-RP in\n   Section 2.4.3)\
    \ only.  Lately, many networks have transitioned away\n   from sparse-dense to\
    \ only sparse mode.\n"
- title: 2.1.3.  Bidirectional PIM
  contents:
  - "2.1.3.  Bidirectional PIM\n   Bidirectional PIM [RFC5015] is a multicast forwarding\
    \ protocol that\n   establishes a common shared-path for all sources with a single\
    \ root.\n   It can be used as an alternative to PIM-SM inside a single domain.\n\
    \   It doesn't have data-driven events or data-encapsulation.  As it\n   doesn't\
    \ keep source-specific state, it may be an appealing approach\n   especially in\
    \ sites with a large number of sources.\n   As of this writing, there is no inter-domain\
    \ solution to configure a\n   group range to use bidirectional PIM.\n"
- title: 2.1.4.  DVMRP
  contents:
  - "2.1.4.  DVMRP\n   Distance Vector Multicast Routing Protocol (DVMRP) [RFC1075]\n\
    \   [DVMRPv3] [DVMRPv3-AS] was the first protocol designed for\n   multicasting.\
    \  To get around initial deployment hurdles, it also\n   included tunneling capabilities,\
    \ which were part of its multicast\n   topology functions.\n   Currently, DVMRP\
    \ is used only very rarely in operator networks,\n   having been replaced with\
    \ PIM-SM.  The most typical deployment of\n   DVMRP is at a leaf network, to run\
    \ from a legacy firewall only\n   supporting DVMRP to the internal network.  However,\
    \ Generic Routing\n   Encapsulation (GRE) tunneling [RFC2784] seems to have overtaken\
    \ DVMRP\n   in this functionality, and there is relatively little use for DVMRP\n\
    \   except in legacy deployments.\n"
- title: 2.1.5.  MOSPF
  contents:
  - "2.1.5.  MOSPF\n   MOSPF [RFC1584] was implemented by several vendors and has\
    \ seen some\n   deployment in intra-domain networks.  However, since it is based\
    \ on\n   intra-domain Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) it does not scale to the\n\
    \   inter-domain case, operators have found it is easier to deploy a\n   single\
    \ protocol for use in both intra-domain and inter-domain\n   networks and so it\
    \ is no longer being actively deployed.\n"
- title: 2.1.6.  BGMP
  contents:
  - "2.1.6.  BGMP\n   BGMP [RFC3913] did not get sufficient support within the service\n\
    \   provider community to get adopted and moved forward in the IETF\n   standards\
    \ process.  There were no reported production implementations\n   and no production\
    \ deployments.\n"
- title: 2.1.7.  CBT
  contents:
  - "2.1.7.  CBT\n   CBT [RFC2201][RFC2189] was an academic project that provided\
    \ the\n   basis for PIM sparse mode shared trees.  Once the shared tree\n   functionality\
    \ was incorporated into PIM implementations, there was no\n   longer a need for\
    \ a production CBT implementation.  Therefore, CBT\n   never saw production deployment.\n"
- title: 2.1.8.  Interactions and Summary
  contents:
  - "2.1.8.  Interactions and Summary\n   It is worth noting that it is possible to\
    \ run different protocols\n   with different multicast group ranges.  For example,\
    \ treat some\n   groups as dense or bidirectional in an otherwise PIM-SM network;\
    \ this\n   typically requires manual configuration of the groups or a mechanism\n\
    \   like BSR (Section 2.4.3).  It is also possible to interact between\n   different\
    \ protocols; for example, use DVMRP in the leaf network, but\n   PIM-SM upstream.\
    \  The basics for interactions among different\n   protocols have been outlined\
    \ in [RFC2715].\n   The following figure gives a concise summary of the deployment\
    \ status\n   of different protocols as of this writing.\n                +--------------+--------------+----------------+\n\

- title: 2.2.  Distributing Topology Information
  contents:
  - "2.2.  Distributing Topology Information\n   PIM has become the de-facto multicast\
    \ forwarding protocol, but as its\n   name implies, it is independent of the underlying\
    \ unicast routing\n   protocol.  When unicast and multicast topologies are the\
    \ same\n   (\"congruent\"), i.e., use the same routing tables (routing information\n\
    \   base, RIB), it has been considered sufficient just to distribute one\n   set\
    \ of reachability information to be used in conjunction with a\n   protocol that\
    \ sets up multicast forwarding state (e.g., PIM-SM).\n   However, when PIM which\
    \ by default built multicast topology based on\n   the unicast topology gained\
    \ popularity, it became apparent that it\n   would be necessary to be able to\
    \ distribute also non-congruent\n   multicast reachability information in the\
    \ regular unicast protocols.\n   This was previously not an issue, because DVMRP\
    \ built its own\n   reachability information.\n   The topology information is\
    \ needed to perform efficient distribution\n   of multicast transmissions and\
    \ to prevent transmission loops by\n   applying it to the Reverse Path Forwarding\
    \ (RPF) check.\n   This subsection introduces these protocols.\n"
- title: 2.2.1.  Multiprotocol BGP
  contents:
  - "2.2.1.  Multiprotocol BGP\n   Multiprotocol Extensions for BGP-4 [RFC4760] (often\
    \ referred to as\n   \"MBGP\"; however, it is worth noting that \"MBGP\" does\
    \ *not* stand for\n   \"Multicast BGP\") specifies a mechanism by which BGP can\
    \ be used to\n   distribute different reachability information for unicast (SAFI=1)\n\
    \   and multicast traffic (SAFI=2).  Multiprotocol BGP has been widely\n   deployed\
    \ for years, and is also needed to route IPv6.  Note that\n   SAFI=3 was originally\
    \ specified for \"both unicast and multicast\" but\n   has since then been deprecated.\n\
    \   These extensions are in widespread use wherever BGP is used to\n   distribute\
    \ unicast topology information.  Multicast-enabled networks\n   that use BGP should\
    \ use Multiprotocol BGP to distribute multicast\n   reachability information explicitly\
    \ even if the topologies are\n   congruent to make an explicit statement about\
    \ multicast reachability.\n   A number of significant multicast transit providers\

  contents:

    \ worth noting that inter-domain incongruence and intra-domain\n   incongruence\
    \ are orthogonal, so one doesn't require the other.\n   Specifically, inter-domain\
    \ incongruence is quite common, while intra-\n   domain incongruence isn't, so\

  - "2.2.3.  Issue: Overlapping Unicast/Multicast Topology\n   An interesting case\

    \ the approaches.\n"
- title: 2.4.1.  Manual RP Configuration
  contents:
  - "2.4.1.  Manual RP Configuration\n   It is often easiest just to manually configure\
    \ the RP information on\n   the routers when PIM-SM is used.\n   Originally, static\
    \ RP mapping was considered suboptimal since it\n   required explicit configuration\
    \ changes every time the RP address\n   changed.  However, with the advent of\
    \ anycast RP addressing, the RP\n   address is unlikely to ever change.  Therefore,\
    \ the administrative\n   burden is generally limited to initial configuration.\
    \  Since there is\n   usually a fair amount of multicast configuration required\
    \ on all\n   routers anyway (e.g., PIM on all interfaces), adding the RP address\n\
    \   statically isn't really an issue.  Further, static anycast RP mapping\n  \
    \ provides the benefits of RP load sharing and redundancy (see\n   Section 2.5)\
    \ without the complexity found in dynamic mechanisms like\n   Auto-RP and Bootstrap\
    \ Router (BSR).\n   With such design, an anycast RP uses an address that is configured\
    \ on\n   a loopback interface of the routers currently acting as RPs, and\n  \
    \ state is distributed using PIM [RFC4610] or MSDP [RFC3446].\n   Using this technique,\
    \ each router might only need to be configured\n   with one, portable RP address.\n"
- title: 2.4.2.  Embedded-RP
  contents:
  - "2.4.2.  Embedded-RP\n   Embedded-RP provides the information about the RP's address\
    \ in the\n   group addresses that are delegated to those who use the RP, so unless\n\
    \   no other ASM than Embedded-RP is used, the network administrator only\n  \
    \ needs to configure the RP routers.\n   While Embedded-RP in many cases is sufficient\
    \ for IPv6, other methods\n   of RP configuration are needed if one needs to provide\
    \ ASM service\n   for other than Embedded-RP group addresses.  In particular,\
    \ service\n   discovery type of applications may need hard-coded addresses that\
    \ are\n   not dependent on local RP addresses.\n   As the RP's address is exposed\
    \ to the users and applications, it is\n   very important to ensure it does not\
    \ change often, e.g., by using\n   manual configuration of an anycast address.\n"
- title: 2.4.3.  BSR and Auto-RP
  contents:
  - "2.4.3.  BSR and Auto-RP\n   BSR [RFC5059] is a mechanism for configuring the\
    \ RP address for\n   groups.  It may no longer be in as wide use with IPv4 as\
    \ it was\n   earlier, and for IPv6, Embedded-RP will in many cases be sufficient.\n\
    \   Cisco's Auto-RP is an older, proprietary method for distributing\n   group\
    \ to RP mappings, similar to BSR.  Auto-RP has little use today.\n   Both Auto-RP\
    \ and BSR require some form of control at the routers to\n   ensure that only\
    \ valid routers are able to advertise themselves as\n   RPs.  Further, flooding\
    \ of BSR and Auto-RP messages must be prevented\n   at PIM borders.  Additionally,\
    \ routers require monitoring that they\n   are actually using the RP(s) the administrators\
    \ think they should be\n   using, for example, if a router (maybe in customer's\
    \ control) is\n   advertising itself inappropriately.  All in all, while BSR and\n\
    \   Auto-RP provide easy configuration, they also provide very\n   significant\
    \ configuration and management complexity.\n   It is worth noting that both Auto-RP\
    \ and BSR were deployed before the\n   use of a manually configured anycast-RP\
    \ address became relatively\n   commonplace, and there is actually relatively\
    \ little need for them\n   today unless there is a need to configure different\

    \ help reduce flooding both from a\n   router to hosts, and from a host to the\
    \ routers (and other hosts).\n   Cisco's proprietary CGMP [CGMP] provides a solution\
    \ where the routers\n   notify the switches, but also allows the switches to snoop\
    \ IGMP\n   packets to enable faster notification of hosts no longer wishing to\n\
    \   receive a group.  Implementations of CGMP do not support fast leave\n   behaviour\
    \ with IGMPv3.  Due to IGMP report suppression in IGMPv1 and\n   IGMPv2, multicast\
    \ is still flooded to ports which were once members\n   of a group as long as\
    \ there is at least one receiver on the link.\n   Flooding restrictions are done\
    \ based on multicast MAC addresses.\n   Implementations of CGMP do not support\
    \ IPv6.\n   IEEE 802.1D-2004 specification describes Generic Attribute\n   Registration\
    \ Protocol (GARP), and GARP Multicast Registration\n   Protocol (GMRP) [GMRP]\
    \ is a link-layer multicast group application of\n   GARP that notifies switches\
    \ about MAC multicast group memberships.\n   If GMRP is used in conjunction with\
    \ IP multicast, then the GMRP\n   registration function would become associated\
    \ with an IGMP \"join\".\n   However, this GMRP-IGMP association is beyond the\
    \ scope of GMRP.\n   GMRP requires support at the host stack and it has not been\
    \ widely\n   implemented.  Further, IEEE 802.1 considers GARP and GMRP obsolete\n\
    \   being replaced by Multiple Registration Protocol (MRP) and Multicast\n   Multiple\
    \ Registration Protocol (MMRP) that are being specified in\n   IEEE 802.1ak [802.1ak].\
    \  MMRP is expected to be mainly used between\n   bridges.  Some further information\
    \ about GARP/GMRP is also available\n   in Appendix B of [RFC3488].\n   IGMP snooping\
    \ [RFC4541] appears to be the most widely implemented\n   technique.  IGMP snooping\
    \ requires that the switches implement a\n   significant amount of IP-level packet\
    \ inspection; this appears to be\n   something that is difficult to get right,\
    \ and often the upgrades are\n   also a challenge.  Snooping support is commonplace\
    \ for IGMPv1 and\n   IGMPv2, but fewer switches support IGMPv3 or MLD (any version)\n\
    \   snooping.  In the worst case, enabling IGMP snooping on a switch that\n  \
    \ does not support IGMPv3 snooping breaks multicast capabilities of\n   nodes\
    \ using IGMPv3.\n   Snooping switches also need to identify the ports where routers\n\
    \   reside and therefore where to flood the packets.  This can be\n   accomplished\
    \ using Multicast Router Discovery protocol [RFC4286],\n   looking at certain\
    \ IGMP queries [RFC4541], looking at PIM Hello and\n   possibly other messages,\
    \ or by manual configuration.  An issue with\n   PIM snooping at LANs is that\
    \ PIM messages can't be turned off or\n   encrypted, leading to security issues\
    \ [PIM-THREATS].\n   IGMP proxying [RFC4605] is sometimes used either as a replacement\
    \ of\n   a multicast routing protocol on a small router, or to aggregate IGMP/\n\

  - "Appendix A.  Multicast Payload Transport Extensions\n   A couple of mechanisms\
    \ have been specified to improve the\n   characteristics of the data that can\
    \ be transported over multicast.\n   We describe those mechanisms that have impact\
    \ on the multicast\n   routing infrastructure, e.g., require or specify router\
    \ assistance or\n   involvement in some form.  Purely end-to-end or host-based\

- title: A.1.  Reliable Multicast
  contents:
  - "A.1.  Reliable Multicast\n   There has been some work on reliable multicast delivery\

    \   instead of simple unreliable UDP.\n   Most of the mechanisms are host-based\
    \ and as such out of scope of\n   this document, but one relevant from multicast\
    \ routing perspective is\n   Pragmatic Generic Multicast (PGM) [RFC3208].  It\
    \ does not require\n   support from the routers, bur PGM-aware routers may act\
