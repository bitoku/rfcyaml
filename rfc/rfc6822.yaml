  - "1.  Introduction\n   An existing limitation of the protocol defined by [ISO10589]\
    \ is that\n   only one instance of the protocol can operate on a given circuit.\n\
    \   This document defines an extension to IS-IS to remove this\n   restriction.\
    \  The extension is referred to as \"Multi-Instance IS-IS\"\n   (MI-IS-IS).\n\
    \   Routers that support this extension are referred to as \"Multi-\n   Instance-capable\
    \ routers\" (MI-RTR).\n   The use of multiple instances enhances the ability to\
    \ isolate the\n   resources associated with a given instance both within a router\
    \ and\n   across the network.  Instance-specific prioritization for processing\n\
    \   PDUs and performing routing calculations within a router may be\n   specified.\
    \  Instance-specific flooding parameters may also be defined\n   so as to allow\
    \ different instances to consume network-wide resources\n   at different rates.\n\
    \   Another existing protocol limitation is that a given instance\n   supports\
    \ a single Update Process operating on a single Link State\n   Database (LSDB).\
    \  This document defines an extension to IS-IS to\n   allow non-zero instances\
    \ of the protocol to support multiple Update\n   Processes.  Each Update Process\
    \ is associated with a topology and a\n   unique topology specific LSDB.  Non-zero\
    \ instances of the protocol\n   are only supported by MI-RTRs.  Legacy routers\
    \ support the standard\n   or zero instance of the protocol.  The behavior of\
    \ the standard\n   instance is not changed in any way by the extensions defined\
    \ in this\n   document.\n   MI-IS-IS might be used to support topology-specific\
    \ routing.  When\n   used for this purpose, it is an alternative to Multi-Topology\
    \ IS-IS\n   [RFC5120].\n   MI-IS-IS might also be used to support advertisement\
    \ of information\n   on behalf of applications [RFC6823].  The advertisement of\n\
    \   information not directly related to the operation of the IS-IS\n   protocol\
    \ can therefore be done in a manner that minimizes its impact\n   on the operation\
    \ of routing.\n   The above are examples of how MI-IS-IS might be used.  The\n\
    \   specification of uses of MI-IS-IS is outside the scope of this\n   document.\n"

- title: 2.  Elements Of Procedure
  contents:
  - "2.  Elements Of Procedure\n   An Instance Identifier (IID) is introduced to uniquely\
    \ identify an\n   IS-IS instance.  The protocol extension includes a new TLV (IID-TLV)\n\
    \   in each IS-IS PDU originated by an MI-RTR except as noted in this\n   document.\
    \  The IID-TLV identifies the unique instance as well as the\n   topology/topologies\
    \ to which the PDU applies.  Each IS-IS PDU is\n   associated with only one IS-IS\
    \ instance.\n   MI-RTRs form instance-specific adjacencies.  The IID-TLV included\
    \ in\n   IS-IS Hellos (IIH) includes the IID and the set of Instance-Specific\n\
    \   Topology Identifiers (ITIDs) that the sending IS supports.  When\n   multiple\
    \ instances share the same circuit, each instance will have a\n   separate set\
    \ of adjacencies.\n   MI-RTRs support the exchange of topology-specific Link State\
    \ PDUs for\n   the IID/ITID pairs that each neighbor supports.  A unique IS-IS\n\
    \   Update Process (see [ISO10589] operates for each IID/ITID pair.  This\n  \
    \ MAY also imply IID/ITID-specific routing calculations and IID/\n   ITID-specific\
    \ routing and forwarding tables.  However, this aspect is\n   outside the scope\
    \ of this specification.\n   The mechanisms used to implement support of the separation\
    \ of IS-IS\n   instances and topology-specific Update Processes within a router\
    \ are\n   outside the scope of this specification.\n"
- title: 2.1.  Instance Identifier TLV
  contents:
  - "2.1.  Instance Identifier TLV\n   A new TLV is defined in order to convey the\
    \ IID and ITIDs supported.\n   The IID-TLV associates a PDU with an IS-IS instance\
    \ using a unique\n   16-bit number.  The IID-TLV is carried in all IS-IS PDUs\
    \ that are\n   associated with a non-zero instance; this includes IIHs, Sequence\n\
    \   Number PDUs (SNPs), and Link State PDUs (LSPs).\n   Multiple instances of\
    \ IS-IS may coexist on the same circuit and on\n   the same physical router. \
    \ IIDs MUST be unique within the same\n   routing domain.\n   IID #0 is reserved\
    \ for the standard instance supported by legacy\n   systems.  IS-IS PDUs associated\
    \ with the standard instance MUST NOT\n   include an IID-TLV except where noted\
    \ in this document.\n   The IID-TLV MAY include one or more ITIDs.  An ITID is\
    \ a 16-bit\n   identifier where all values (0 - 65535) are valid.\n   The following\
    \ format is used for the IID-TLV:\n     Type:   7\n     Length: 2 - 254\n    \
    \ Value:\n                                            No. of octets\n        \
    \         +-------------------------+\n                 | IID (0 - 65535)    \
    \     |     2\n                 +-------------------------+\n                \
    \ | Supported ITID          |     2\n                 +-------------------------+\n\
    \                 :                         :\n                 +-------------------------+\n\

    \   When the IID = 0, the list of supported ITIDs MUST NOT be present.\n   An\
    \ IID-TLV with IID = 0 MUST NOT appear in an SNP or LSP.  When the\n   TLV appears\
    \ (with a non-zero IID) in an SNP or LSP, exactly one ITID\n   MUST be present\
    \ indicating the topology with which the PDU is\n   associated.  If no ITIDs or\
    \ multiple ITIDs are present or the IID is\n   zero, then the PDU MUST be ignored.\n\
    \   When the IID is non-zero and the TLV appears in an IIH, the set of\n   ITIDs\
    \ supported on the circuit over which the IIH is sent is\n   included.  There\
    \ MUST be at least one ITID present.\n   Multiple IID-TLVs MAY appear in IIHs.\
    \  If multiple IID-TLVs are\n   present and the IID value in all IID-TLVs is not\
    \ the same, then the\n   PDU MUST be ignored.\n   A single IID-TLV will support\
    \ advertisement of up to 126 ITIDs.  If\n   multiple IID-TLVs are present in an\
    \ IIH PDU, the supported set of\n   ITIDs is the union of all ITIDs present in\
    \ all IID-TLVs.\n   When an LSP purge is initiated, the IID-TLV MUST be retained,\
    \ but the\n   remainder of the body of the LSP SHOULD be removed.  The purge\n\
    \   procedure is described in [RFC6233] and [RFC6232].\n   A PDU without an IID-TLV\
    \ belongs to the standard instance.\n"
- title: 2.2.  Instance Membership
  contents:
  - "2.2.  Instance Membership\n   Each MI-RTR is configured to be participating in\
    \ one or more\n   instances of IS-IS.  For each non-zero instance in which it\n\
    \   participates, an MI-RTR marks IS-IS PDUs (IIHs, LSPs, or SNPs)\n   generated\
    \ that pertain to that instance by including the IID-TLV with\n   the appropriate\
    \ instance identifier.\n"
- title: 2.3.  Use of Authentication
  contents:
  - "2.3.  Use of Authentication\n   When authentication is in use, the IID, if present,\
    \ is first used to\n   select the authentication configuration that is applicable.\
    \  The\n   authentication check is then performed as normal.  When multiple\n\
    \   ITIDs are supported, ITID-specific authentication MAY be used in SNPs\n  \
    \ and LSPs.\n"

  contents:
  - "2.4.  Adjacency Establishment\n   In order to establish adjacencies, IS-IS routers\
    \ exchange IIH PDUs.\n   Two types of adjacencies exist in IS-IS: point-to-point\
    \ and\n   broadcast.  The following subsections describe the additional rules\n\
    \   an MI-RTR MUST follow when establishing adjacencies.\n"
- title: 2.4.1.  Point-to-Point Adjacencies
  contents:
  - "2.4.1.  Point-to-Point Adjacencies\n   MI-RTRs include the IID-TLV in the point-to-point\
    \ Hello PDUs they\n   originate.  Upon reception of an IIH, an MI-RTR inspects\
    \ the received\n   IID-TLV and if the IID matches any of the IIDs that the router\n\
    \   supports on that circuit, normal adjacency establishment procedures\n   are\
    \ used to establish an instance-specific adjacency.  Note that the\n   absence\
    \ of the IID TLV implies IID #0.  For instances other than IID\n   #0, an adjacency\
    \ SHOULD NOT be established unless there is at least\n   one ITID in common.\n\
    \   This extension allows an MI-RTR to establish multiple adjacencies to\n   the\
    \ same physical neighbor over a point-to-point circuit.  However,\n   as the instances\
    \ are logically independent, the normal expectation of\n   at most one neighbor\
    \ on a given point-to-point circuit still applies.\n"
- title: 2.4.2.  Multi-Access Adjacencies
  contents:
  - "2.4.2.  Multi-Access Adjacencies\n   Multi-Access (broadcast) circuits behave\
    \ differently than point-to-\n   point in that PDUs sent by one router are visible\
    \ to all routers and\n   all routers must agree on the election of a Designated\
    \ Intermediate\n   System (DIS) independent of the set of ITIDs supported.\n \
    \  MI-RTRs will establish adjacencies and elect a DIS per IS-IS\n   instance.\
    \  Each MI-RTR will form adjacencies only with routers that\n   advertise support\
    \ for the instances that the local router has been\n   configured to support on\
    \ that circuit.  Since an MI-RTR is not\n   required to support all possible instances\
    \ on a LAN, it's possible to\n   elect a different DIS for different instances.\n"

  - "2.6.1.  Interoperability Issues on Broadcast Circuits\n   In order for routers\
    \ to correctly interoperate with routers not\n   implementing this extension and\
    \ in order not to cause disruption, a\n   specific and dedicated Media Access\
    \ Control (MAC) address is used for\n   multicasting IS-IS PDUs with any non-zero\
    \ IID.  Each level will use a\n   specific layer 2 multicast address.  Such an\
    \ address allows MI-RTRs\n   to exchange IS-IS PDUs with non-zero IIDs without\
    \ these PDUs being\n   processed by legacy routers, and therefore no disruption\
    \ is caused.\n   An MI-RTR will use the AllL1IS or AllL2IS ISIS MAC-layer address\
    \ (as\n   defined in [ISO10589]) as the destination address when sending an\n\
    \   IS-IS PDU for the standard instance.  An MI-RTR will use one of two\n   new\
    \ dedicated layer 2 multicast addresses (AllL1MI-ISs or AllL2MI-\n   ISs) as the\

    \  MI-RTRs MUST discard IS-IS PDUs received if either of the following\n   is\
    \ true:\n   o  The destination multicast address is AllL1IS or AllL2IS and the\n\
    \      PDU contains an IID-TLV.\n   o  The destination multicast address is one\
    \ of the two new addresses,\n      and the PDU contains an IID-TLV with a zero\
    \ value for the IID or\n      has no IID-TLV.\n   NOTE: If the multicast addresses\
    \ AllL1IS and/or AllL2IS are\n   improperly used to send IS-IS PDUs for non-zero\
    \ IIDs, legacy systems\n   will interpret these PDUs as being associated with\

    \ extension, respectively.\n   Therefore, all IIHs sent on a point-to-point circuit\
    \ by an MI-RTR\n   MUST include an IID-TLV.  This includes IIHs associated with\

  - "3.2.  Many-to-One Mapping between Topologies and Instances\n   When the set of\
    \ information to be flooded in LSPs includes subsets\n   that are of interest\
    \ to a subset of the MI-RTRs supporting a given\n   IID, support of multiple ITIDs\
    \ allows each subset to be flooded only\n   to those MI-RTRs that are interested\
    \ in that subset.  In the simplest\n   case, a one-to-one mapping between a given\
    \ application and an ITID\n   allows the information associated with that application\
    \ to be flooded\n   only to MI-RTRs that support that application -- but a many-to-one\n\
    \   mapping between applications and a given ITID is also possible.  When\n  \
    \ the set of application-specific information is large, the use of\n   multiple\
    \ ITIDs provides significantly greater efficiencies, as\n   MI-RTRs only need\
    \ to maintain the LSDB for applications of interest\n   and that information only\
    \ needs to be flooded over a topology defined\n   by the MI-RTRs who support a\
    \ given ITID.\n   The use of multiple ITIDs also allows the dedication of a full\
    \ LSP\n   set (256 LSPs at each level) for the use of a given (set of)\n   applications,\
    \ thereby minimizing the possibility of exceeding the\n   carrying capacity of\
    \ an LSP set.  Such a possibility might arise if\n   information for all applications\
    \ were to be included in a single LSP\n   set.\n   Note that the topology associated\
    \ with each ITID MUST be fully\n   connected in order for ITID-specific LSPs to\
    \ be successfully flooded\n   to all MI-RTRs that support that ITID.\n"

  - "3.3.  Considerations for the Number of Instances\n   The support of multiple\
    \ topologies within the context of a single\n   instance provides better scalability\
    \ in support of multiple\n   applications both in terms of the number of adjacencies\
    \ that are\n   required and in the flooding of topology-specific LSDB.  In many\n\
    \   cases, the use of a single non-zero instance would be sufficient and\n   optimal.\
    \  However, in cases where the set of topologies desired in\n   support of a set\
    \ of applications is largely disjoint from the set of\n   topologies desired in\
    \ support of a second set of applications, it\n   could make sense to use multiple\
    \ instances.\n"
- title: 4.  Relationship to M-ISIS
  contents:
  - "4.  Relationship to M-ISIS\n   [RFC5120] defines support for multi-topology routing.\
    \  In that\n   document, 12-bit Multi-Topology Identifiers (MTIDs) are defined\
    \ to\n   identify the topologies that an IS-IS instance (a \"standard instance\"\
    \n   as defined by this document) supports.  There is no relationship\n   between\
    \ the Multi-topology IDs defined in [RFC5120] and the ITIDs\n   defined in this\
    \ document.\n   If an MI-RTR uses the extensions in support of the BFD-Enabled\
    \ TLV\n   [RFC6213], the ITID SHOULD be used in place of the MTID, in which\n\
    \   case all 16 bits of the identifier field are usable.\n   An MI-RTR MAY use\
    \ the extensions defined in this document to support\n   multiple topologies in\
    \ the context of an instance with a non-zero\n   IID.  Each MI topology is associated\
    \ with a unique LSDB identified by\n   an ITID.  An ITID-specific IS-IS Update\
    \ Process operates on each\n   topology.  This differs from [RFC5120] where a\
    \ single LSDB or single\n   IS-IS Update Process is used in support of all topologies.\n\
    \   An MI-RTR MUST NOT support [RFC5120] multi-topology within a non-zero\n  \
    \ instance.  The following TLVs MUST NOT be sent in an LSP associated\n   with\
    \ a non-zero instance and MUST be ignored when received:\n    TLV 222 - MT IS\
    \ Neighbors\n    TLV 235 - MT IP Reachability\n    TLV 237 - MT IPv6 Reachability\n"
