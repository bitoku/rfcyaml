  contents:
  - "1.  RFCs and Jon Postel\n   Forty years ago today, the first Request for Comments\
    \ document, RFC\n   1, was published at UCLA [RFC1].  This was the first of a\
    \ series that\n   currently contains more than 5400 documents (roughly 160,000\
    \ pages)\n   on computer networking in general and on the Internet protocols in\n\
    \   particular.  The RFC series emerged from the US government-funded\n   research\
    \ efforts that created the ARPANET and later the Internet.\n   When the IETF was\
    \ formed in the mid-1980s, RFCs became the primary\n   publication vehicle for\
    \ IETF standards, and thus became centered on\n   the vendor and user communities.\n\
    \   For the first 29 years, Jon Postel [Postel] was *the* RFC Editor,\n   until\
    \ his untimely death in October 1998.  Postel, with substantial\n   help from\
    \ Joyce K. Reynolds, was responsible for the collection,\n   editing, online publication,\
    \ and archiving of the RFC documents.\n   From 1978 until 1998, Postel was a research\
    \ scientist at the USC\n   Information Sciences Institute (USC/ISI) in Marina\
    \ del Rey,\n   California.  Postel was also the original IANA as well as Director\
    \ of\n   the Computer Networks Division at ISI.\n   Upon the occasion of the 30th\
    \ anniversary of RFC 1 and as a tribute\n   to the massive contribution of Jon\
    \ Postel, the RFC Editor published\n   RFC 2555 [RFC2555] on April 7, 1999.  This\
    \ RFC contained\n   recollections from three networking pioneers: Steve Crocker\
    \ who wrote\n   RFC 1, Vint Cerf whose long-range vision continues to guide us,\
    \ and\n   Jake Feinler who played a key role in the middle years of the RFC\n\
    \   series.\n   Ten more years have now passed, and we have reached the 40th\n\
    \   anniversary of the RFC series.  The series has more than doubled in\n   size\
    \ during the last ten years, and it is expected to continue far\n   into the future.\
    \  All the good things said in RFC 2555 still hold\n   true ten years later.\n\
    \   We should, however, note some changes that have occurred over the\n   past\
    \ ten years.\n   o  After Jon passed away, Joyce Reynolds and Bob Braden put together\n\
    \      a small organization at USC/ISI to continue the RFC Editor\n      function.\
    \  This was motivated by a desire to honor Postel by\n      continuing his remarkable\
    \ effort and to provide a service to the\n      Internet community.\n   o  Funding\
    \ of the RFC Editor, which had been supported by the US\n      government until\
    \ 1998, was taken over by the Internet Society.\n      During 1998-2006, ISOC\
    \ funded the RFC Editor under a series of\n      annual contracts and extensions.\
    \  ISOC put the function out for\n      competitive bid for 2007 (USC/ISI was\
    \ selected to provide RFC\n      Editor services from 2007-2009), and the contract\
    \ will be put out\n      to bid again for post-2009.\n      During 2009 there\
    \ will be a significant transition for the RFC\n      Editor function, as some\
    \ new organization or set of organizations\n      takes over this service that\
    \ has been performed at USC/ISI\n      continuously since 1978.\n   o  Many improvements\
    \ have increased the efficiency and transparency\n      of the RFC editorial process\
    \ [RFCed09].\n   o  The RFC Editor formed an RFC Editorial Board, a group of people\n\
    \      with broad and deep knowledge of the Internet and networking.  One\n  \
    \    of its major functions is to assist the RFC Editor by reviewing\n      RFCs\
    \ in the Independent Submission stream.\n   o  An email list, rfc-interest@rfc-editor.org,\
    \ was created to obtain\n      community input on the RFC Editor functions.\n"
