    \ leader.  The link was originally defined as an 8\n   bit field.  Some time after\
    \ the ARPANET Host-to-Host (AHHP) protocol\n   was defined and, by now, some time\
    \ ago the definition of this field\n   was changed to \"Message-ID\" and the length\
    \ to 12 bits. The name link\n   now refers to the high order 8 bits of this 12\
    \ bit message-id field.\n   The low order 4 bits of the message-id field are to\
    \ be zero unless\n   specifically specified otherwise for the particular protocol\
