  - "Abstract\n   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)\n\
    \   for use with network management protocols in TCP/IP-based internets.\n   In\
    \ particular, it defines objects for managing DS1 Interfaces --\n   including\
    \ both T1 and E1 (a.k.a., CEPT 2 Mbit/s) links.\n   This document entirely replaces\
    \ RFC 1232, which contains a\n   fundamental error: many objects are encoded as\
    \ Counters that must be\n   encoded as INTEGERs or Gauges.  The magnitude of the\
    \ change required\n   is sufficient that virtually every object changed.  Therefore,\
    \ the\n   MIB documented in RFC 1232 should not be implemented.\n"

- title: 1.  The Network Management Framework
  contents:
  - "1.  The Network Management Framework\n   The Internet-standard Network Management\
    \ Framework consists of three\n   components.  They are:\n      STD 16/RFC 1155\
    \ [1] which defines the SMI, the mechanisms used for\n      describing and naming\
    \ objects for the purpose of management.  STD\n      16/RFC 1212 [2] defines a\
    \ more concise description mechanism,\n      which is wholly consistent with the\
    \ SMI.\n      RFC 1156 [3] which defines MIB-I, the core set of managed objects\n\
    \      for the Internet suite of protocols.  STD 17/RFC 1213 [4] defines\n   \
    \   MIB-II, an evolution of MIB-I based on implementation experience\n      and\
    \ new operational requirements.\n      STD 15/RFC 1157 [5] which defines the SNMP,\
    \ the protocol used for\n      network access to managed objects.\n   The Framework\
    \ permits new objects to be defined for the purpose of\n   experimentation and\
    \ evaluation.\n"
- title: 2.  Objects
  contents:
  - "2.  Objects\n   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store,\
    \ termed\n   the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are\n\
    \   defined using the subset of Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1) [6]\n   defined\
    \ in the SMI.  In particular, each object has a name, a syntax,\n   and an encoding.\
    \  The name is an object identifier, an\n   administratively assigned name, which\
    \ specifies an object type.  The\n   object type together with an object instance\
    \ serves to uniquely\n   identify a specific instantiation of the object.  For\
    \ human\n   convenience, we often use a textual string, termed the OBJECT\n  \
    \ DESCRIPTOR, to also refer to the object type.\n   The syntax of an object type\
    \ defines the abstract data structure\n   corresponding to that object type. \
    \ The ASN.1 language is used for\n   this purpose.  However, the SMI [1] purposely\
    \ restricts the ASN.1\n   constructs which may be used.  These restrictions are\
    \ explicitly made\n   for simplicity.\n   The encoding of an object type is simply\
    \ how that object type is\n   represented using the object type's syntax.  Implicitly\
    \ tied to the\n   notion of an object type's syntax and encoding is how the object\
    \ type\n   is represented when being transmitted on the network.\n   The SMI specifies\
    \ the use of the basic encoding rules of ASN.1 [7],\n   subject to the additional\
    \ requirements imposed by the SNMP.\n"
- title: 2.1.  Format of Definitions
  contents:
  - "2.1.  Format of Definitions\n   Section 4 contains contains the specification\
    \ of all object types\n   contained in this MIB module.  The object types are\
    \ defined using the\n   conventions defined in the SMI, as amended by the extensions\n\
    \   specified in STD 16, RFC 1212 [2].\n"
- title: 2.2.  Changes from RFC 1232
  contents:
  - "2.2.  Changes from RFC 1232\n   The changes from RFC 1232 are the following:\n\
    \     (1)  This MIB module contains three groups: DS1 Near End Group\n       \
    \   which is mandatory, DS1 Far End Group which is optional,\n          and the\
    \ Fractional Table, which is optional.\n     (2)  The Far End Group is a new group\
    \ and contains statistics\n          that are collected from the far end DS1 interface.\
    \  The\n          Far End Group may only be implemented by DS1 systems that\n\
    \          use the facilities data link to exchange this information\n       \
    \   - both T1.403 and PUB 54016 define ways to exchange this\n          information\
    \ over data links; vendors may use other\n          proprietary means to do this\
    \ on various link types.\n     (3)  ds1CSUIndex has been renamed dsx1LineIndex.\
    \  This object\n          is the identifier of a DS1 Interface on a device.  On\
    \ a\n          CSU, a single DS1 data stream will cross two DS1\n          interfaces,\
    \ which have separate dsx1LineIndex values.\n     (4)  ds1Index has been renamed\
    \ dsx1IfIndex.  This value for\n          this object is equal to the value of\
    \ ifIndex from the\n          Interfaces table of MIB II (STD 17, RFC 1213).\n\
    \     (5)  an object has been added (dsx1TransmitClockSource) to\n          indicate\
    \ the source of transmit clock.\n     (6)  The ACCESS for objects in the dsx1ConfigTable\
    \ has been\n          set to read-write for items that are configurable.\n   \
    \  (7)  Description of test configurations has changed.  A new\n          object\
    \ has been added called dsx1LoopbackConfig, which\n          better describes\
    \ the loopback capabilities of a DS1\n          interface on a device.\n     (8)\
    \  The description of line alarm status has changed.  A new\n          object\
    \ has been added called dsx1LineStatus.  This object\n          better describes\
    \ the status (e.g., failure state and\n          loopback state) of a DS1 interface.\n\
    \     (9)  All Counters have been changed to Gauges.\n     (10) Information about\
    \ how applications might use the zero\n          code suppression have been removed;\
    \ only the actual line\n          coding algorithm is described.  For clarity\
    \ the object\n          was thus renamed to dsx1LineCoding.\n     (11) A Line\
    \ Errored Seconds object has been added to all near\n          end tables and\
    \ the count of Bipolar Violations (BPVs) was\n          changed to a count of\
    \ Line Code Violations (LCVs).\n     (12) Bursty Errored Seconds (a.k.a., Errored\
    \ Seconds Type B)\n          and Degraded Minutes objects have been added to all\
    \ near\n          end tables.\n     (13) The Coding Violation error event is now\
    \ referred to as a\n          Path Coding Violation (PCV) Error Event.\n"

  - "3.  Overview\n   These objects are used when the particular media being used\
    \ to\n   realize an interface is a DS1 physical interface.  At present, this\n\
    \   applies to these values of the ifType variable in the Internet-\n   standard\
    \ MIB:\n            ds1 (18)\n            e1  (19)\n   The definitions contained\
    \ herein are based on the AT&T T-1 Superframe\n   (a.k.a., D4) and Extended Superframe\
    \ (ESF) formats [8, 9], the latter\n   of which conforms to ANSI specifications\
    \ [10], and the CCITT\n   Recommendations [11, 12], referred to as E1 for the\
    \ rest of this\n   memo.\n   The various T1 and E1 line disciplines are similar\
    \ enough that\n   separate MIBs are unwarranted, although there are some differences.\n\
    \   For example, Loss of Frame is defined more rigorously in the ESF\n   specification\
    \ than in the D4 specification, but it is defined in\n   both.\n   Where it is\
    \ necessary to distinguish between the flavors of E1 with\n   and without CRC,\
    \ E1-CRC to denotes the \"with CRC\" form (G.704 Table\n   4b) and E1-noCRC denotes\
    \ the \"without CRC\" form (G.704 Table 4a).\n"
- title: 3.1.  Binding between ifIndex and DS1 Interfaces
  contents:
  - "3.1.  Binding between ifIndex and DS1 Interfaces\n   Different physical configurations\
    \ for the support of SNMP with DS1\n   equipment exist. To accommodate these scenarios,\
    \ two different\n   indices for DS1 interfaces are introduced in this MIB.  These\
    \ indices\n   are dsx1IfIndex and dsx1LineIndex.\n   External interface scenario:\
    \ the SNMP Agent represents all managed\n   DS1 lines as external interfaces (for\
    \ example, an Agent residing on\n   the device supporting DS1 interfaces directly):\n\
    \   For this scenario, all interfaces are assigned an integer value equal\n  \
    \ to ifIndex, and the following applies:\n         ifIndex=dsx1IfIndex=dsx1LineIndex\
    \ for all interfaces.\n   The dsx1IfIndex column of the DS1 Configuration table\
    \ relates each\n   DS1 interface to its corresponding interface (ifIndex) in the\n\
    \   Internet-standard MIB (MIB-II STD 17, RFC 1213).\n   External & Internal interface\
    \ scenario: the SNMP Agents resides on an\n   host external from the device supporting\
    \ DS1 interfaces (e.g., a\n   router).  The Agent represents both the host and\
    \ the DS1 device.  The\n   index dsx1LineIndex is used to not only represent the\
    \ DS1 interfaces\n   external from the host/DS1-device combination, but also the\
    \ DS1\n   interfaces connecting the host and the DS1 device.  The index\n   dsx1IfIndex\
    \ is always equal to ifIndex.\n   Example:\n   A shelf full of CSUs connected\
    \ to a Router.  An SNMP Agent residing\n   on the router proxies for itself and\
    \ the CSU.  The router has also an\n   Ethernet interface:\n           +-----+\n\

    \ is an ifEntry that is\n   directly associated with this and only this DS1 interface,\
    \ it should\n   have the same value as ifIndex.  Otherwise, number the\n   dsx1LineIndices\
    \ with an unique identifier following the rules of\n   choosing a number greater\
    \ than ifNumber and numbering inside\n   interfaces (e.g., equipment side) with\
    \ even numbers and outside\n   interfaces (e.g., network side) with odd numbers.\n\
    \   If the CSU shelf is managed by itself by a local SNMP Agent, the\n   situation\
    \ would be:\n          ifIndex (= dsx1IfIndex)               dsx1LineIndex\n \

    \ become available in time.\n          In the T1M1.3 specification, near end Line\
    \ Code\n          Violations and far end Line Errored Seconds are counted.\n \

    \     Controlled Slip Seconds (CSS)\n          A Controlled Slip Second is a one-second\

    \ (ES)\n          For ESF and E1-CRC links an Errored Second is a second\n   \

    \          Violations also triggers an Errored Second.\n          This is not\
    \ incremented during an Unavailable Second.\n     Bursty Errored Seconds (BES)\n\
    \          A Bursty Errored Second (also known as Errored Second\n          type\
    \ B) is a second with fewer than 320 and more than 1\n          Path Coding Violation\
    \ error events, no Severely Errored\n          Frame defects and no detected incoming\

    \          or more Out of Frame defects OR a detected AIS defect.\n          For\
    \ E1-CRC signals, a Severely Errored Second is a second\n          with 832 or\
    \ more Path Code Violation error events OR one\n          or more Out of Frame\
    \ defects.\n          For E1-noCRC signals, a Severely Errored Second is a 2048\n\
    \          LCVs or more.\n          For D4 signals, a Severely Errored Second\
    \ is a count of\n          one-second intervals with Framing Error events, or\
    \ an OOF\n          defect, or 1544 LCVs or more.\n          Controlled slips\

    \      A Degraded Minute is one in which the estimated error\n          rate exceeds\
    \ 1E-6 but does not exceed 1E-3 (see G.821\n          [15]).\n          Degraded\
    \ Minutes are determined by collecting all of the\n          Available Seconds,\
    \ removing any Severely Errored Seconds\n          grouping the result in 60-second\
    \ long groups and counting\n          a 60-second long group (a.k.a., minute)\
    \ as degraded if the\n          cumulative errors during the seconds present in\
    \ the group\n          exceed 1E-6.  Available seconds are merely those seconds\n\
    \          which are not Unavailable as described below.\n     Unavailable Seconds\
    \ (UAS)\n          Unavailable Seconds (UAS) are calculated by counting the\n\
    \          number of seconds that the interface is unavailable.  The\n       \
    \   DS1 interface is said to be unavailable from the onset of\n          10 contiguous\
    \ SESs, or the onset of the condition leading\n          to a failure (see Failure\
    \ States).  If the condition\n          leading to the failure was immediately\
    \ preceded by one or\n          more contiguous SESs, then the DS1 interface\n\
    \          unavailability starts from the onset of these SESs.  Once\n       \
    \   unavailable, and if no failure is present, the DS1\n          interface becomes\
    \ available at the onset of 10 contiguous\n          seconds with no SESs.  Once\
    \ unavailable, and if a failure\n          is present, the DS1 interface becomes\
    \ available at the\n          onset of 10 contiguous seconds with no SESs, if\
    \ the\n          failure clearing time is less than or equal to 10\n         \
    \ seconds.  If the failure clearing time is more than 10\n          seconds, the\
    \ DS1 interface becomes available at the onset\n          of 10 contiguous seconds\
    \ with no SESs, or the onset\n          period leading to the successful clearing\
    \ condition,\n          whichever occurs later.  With respect to the DS1 error\n\
    \          counts, all counters are incremented while the DS1\n          interface\
    \ is deemed available.  While the interface is\n          deemed unavailable,\
    \ the only count that is incremented is\n          UASs.\n          A special\
    \ case exists when the 10 or more second period\n          crosses the 900 second\
    \ statistics window boundary, as the\n          foregoing description implies\
    \ that the Severely Errored\n          Second and Unavailable Second counters\
    \ must be adjusted\n          when the Unavailable Signal State is entered.  Clearly,\n\
    \          successive GETs of the affected dsx1IntervalSESs and\n          dsx1IntervalUASs\
    \ objects will return differing values if\n          the first GET occurs during\
    \ the first few seconds of the\n          window.  This is viewed as an unavoidable\
    \ side-effect of\n          selecting the presently defined managed objects as\
    \ a\n          basis for this memo.\n"

  contents:
  - "3.3.4.  Failure States\n   The following failure states are received, or detected\
    \ failures, that\n   are reported in the dsx1LineStatus object.  When a DS1 interface\n\
    \   would, if ever, produce the conditions leading to the failure state\n   is\
    \ described in the appropriate specification.\n     Far End Alarm Failure\n  \
    \        The Far End Alarm failure is also known as \"Yellow Alarm\"\n       \
    \   in the T1 case and \"Distant Alarm\" in the E1 case.\n          For D4 links,\
    \ the Far End Alarm failure is declared when\n          bit 6 of all channels\
    \ has been zero for at least 335 ms\n          and is cleared when bit 6 of at\
    \ least one channel is\n          non-zero for a period T, where T is usually\
    \ less than one\n          second and always less than 5 seconds.  The Far End\
    \ Alarm\n          failure is not declared for D4 links when a Loss of\n     \
    \     Signal is detected.\n          For ESF links, the Far End Alarm failure\
    \ is declared if\n          the Yellow Alarm signal pattern occurs in at least\
    \ seven\n          out of ten contiguous 16-bit pattern intervals and is\n   \
    \       cleared if the Yellow Alarm signal pattern does not occur\n          in\
    \ ten contiguous 16-bit signal pattern intervals.\n          For E1 links, the\
    \ Far End Alarm failure is declared when\n          bit 3 of time-slot zero is\
    \ received set to one on two\n          consecutive occasions.  The Far End Alarm\
    \ failure is\n          cleared when bit 3 of time-slot zero is received set to\n\
    \          zero.\n     Alarm Indication Signal (AIS) Failure\n          The Alarm\
    \ Indication Signal failure is declared when an\n          AIS defect is detected\
    \ at the input and the  AIS defect\n          still exists after the Loss Of Frame\
    \ failure (which is\n          caused by the unframed nature of the 'all-ones'\
    \ signal)\n          is declared. The AIS failure is cleared when the Loss Of\n\
    \          Frame failure is cleared.\n     Loss Of Frame Failure\n          For\
    \ T1 links, the Loss Of Frame failure is declared when\n          an OOF or LOS\
    \  defect has persisted for T seconds, where\n          2 <= T <= 10.  The Loss\
    \ Of Frame failure is cleared when\n          there have been no OOF or LOS defects\
    \ during a period T\n          where 0 <= T <= 20.  Many systems will perform\
    \ \"hit\n          integration\" within the period T before declaring or\n   \
    \       clearing the failure e.g., see TR 62411 [16].\n          For E1 links,\
    \ the Loss Of Frame Failure is declared when\n          an OOF defect is detected.\n\
    \     Loss Of Signal Failure\n          For T1, the Loss Of Signal failure is\
    \ declared upon\n          observing 175 +/- 75 contiguous pulse positions with\
    \ no\n          pulses of either positive or negative polarity.  The LOS\n   \
    \       failure is cleared upon observing an average pulse\n          density\
    \ of at least 12.5% over a period of 175 +/- 75\n          contiguous pulse positions\
    \ starting with the receipt of a\n          pulse.\n          For E1 links, the\
    \ Loss Of Signal failure is declared when\n          greater than 10 consecutive\
    \ zeroes are detected (see\n          O.162 Section 3.4.4).\n     Loopback Pseudo-Failure\n\
    \          The Loopback Pseudo-Failure is declared when the near end\n       \
    \   equipment has placed a loopback (of any kind) on the DS1.\n          This\
    \ allows a management entity to determine from one\n          object whether the\
    \ DS1 can be considered to be in service\n          or not (from the point of\
    \ view of the near end\n          equipment).\n     TS16 Alarm Indication Signal\
    \ Failure\n          For E1 links, the TS16 Alarm Indication Signal failure is\n\
    \          declared when time-slot 16 is received as all ones for\n          all\
    \ frames of two consecutive multiframes (see G.732\n          Section 4.2.6).\
    \  This condition is never declared for T1.\n     Loss Of MultiFrame Failure\n\
    \          The Loss Of MultiFrame failure is declared when two\n          consecutive\
    \ multiframe alignment signals (bits 4 through\n          7 of TS16 of frame 0)\
    \ have been received with an error.\n          The Loss Of Multiframe failure\
    \ is cleared when the first\n          correct multiframe alignment signal is\
    \ received.  The\n          Loss Of Multiframe failure can only be declared for\
    \ E1\n          links operating with G.732 [18] framing (sometimes called\n  \
    \        \"Channel Associated Signalling\" mode).\n     Far End Loss Of Multiframe\
    \ Failure\n          The Far End Loss Of Multiframe failure is declared when\n\
    \          bit 2 of TS16 of frame 0 is received set to one on two\n          consecutive\
    \ occasions.  The Far End Loss Of Multiframe\n          failure is cleared when\
    \ bit 2 of TS16 of frame 0 is\n          received set to zero.  The Far End Loss\
    \ Of Multiframe\n          failure can only be declared for E1 links operating\
    \ in\n          \"Channel Associated Signalling\" mode.\n"
