- title: Abstract
  contents:
  - "Abstract\n   Traceroute serves as a valuable network debugging tool.  The way\
    \ in\n   which it is currently implemented has the advantage of being\n   automatically\
    \ supported by all of the routers.  It's two problems are\n   the number of packets\
    \ it generates and the amount of time it takes to\n   run.\n   This document specifies\
    \ a new IP option and ICMP message type which\n   duplicates the functionality\
    \ of the existing traceroute method while\n   generating fewer packets and completing\
    \ in a shorter time.\n"

  - "1.  Traceroute Today\n   The existing traceroute operates by sending out a packet\
    \ with a Time\n   To Live (TTL) of 1.  The first hop then sends back an ICMP [1]\
    \ error\n   message indicating that the packet could not be forwarded because\
    \ the\n   TTL expired.  The packet is then resent with a TTL of 2, and the\n \
    \  second hop returns the TTL expired.  This process continues until the\n   destination\
    \ is reached.  The purpose behind this is to record the\n   source of each ICMP\
    \ TTL exceeded message to provide a trace of the\n   path the packet took to reach\
    \ the destination.\n   The advantage of this algorithm, is that every router already\
    \ has the\n   ability to send TTL exceeded messages.  No special code is required.\n\
    \   The disadvantages are the number of packets generated (2n, where n is\n  \
    \ the number of hops), the time it takes to duplicate all the nearer\n   hops\
    \ with each successive packet, and the fact that the path may\n   change during\
    \ this process.  Also, this algorithm does not trace the\n   return path, which\
    \ may differ from the outbound path.\n"
- title: 2.  Traceroute Tomorrow
  contents:
  - "2.  Traceroute Tomorrow\n   The proposed traceroute would use a different algorithm\
    \ to achieve\n   the same goal, namely, to trace the path to a host.  Because\
    \ the new\n   traceroute uses an ICMP message designed for the purpose, additional\n\
    \   information, unavailable to the original traceroute user, can be made\n  \
    \ available.\n"
- title: 2.1 Basic Algorithm
  contents:
  - "2.1 Basic Algorithm\n   A new IP Traceroute option will be defined.  The presence\
    \ of this\n   option in an ICMP Echo (or any other) packet, hereinafter referred\
    \ to\n   as the Outbound Packet, will cause a router to send the newly defined\n\
    \   ICMP Traceroute message to the originator of the Outbound Packet.  In\n  \
    \ this way, the path of the Outbound Packet will be logged by the\n   originator\
    \ with only n+1 (instead of 2n) packets.  This algorithm\n   does not suffer from\
    \ a changing path and allows the response to the\n   Outbound Packet, hereinafter\
    \ refered to as the Return Packet, to be\n   traced (provided the Outbound Packet's\
    \ destination preserves the IP\n   Traceroute option in the Return Packet).\n\
    \   The disadvantage of this method is that the traceroute function will\n   have\
    \ to be put into the routers.  To counter this disadvantage,\n   however, is the\
    \ fact that this mechanism may be easily ported to a\n   new IP version.\n"

- title: 3.  Protocol
  contents:
  - "3.  Protocol\n   The Outbound Packet which is used to carry the IP Traceroute\
    \ option\n   should use no special Type Of Service (TOS) or Precedence, unless\
    \ the\n   purpose is to trace the path of packets with special TOS or\n   Precedence\
    \ values.\n   The TTL of the Outbound Packet should be set to the default value\n\
    \   specified in \"Assigned Numbers\" [2].\n"
- title: 3.1 Hop Counts
  contents:
  - "3.1 Hop Counts\n   The hop counts ultimately provide information on the length\
    \ of the\n   outbound and return paths to the destination.  They also provide\
    \ a\n   means of determining whether or not any ICMP Traceroute messages have\n\
    \   been lost.  For example, if a Traceroute message with an OHC of 4 is\n   followed\
    \ by a message with an OHC of 6, then the the message with an\n   OHC of 5 was\
    \ lost.  This is why simply counting Traceroute messages\n   is not sufficient\
    \ for determining path length.\n   The originator of the Outbound Packet should\
    \ set the OHC to zero and\n   the RHC to 0xFFFF.  0xFFFF is a special value which\
    \ indicates to\n   routers that the packet is an Outbound Packet rather than a\
    \ Return\n   Packet (which begins with an RHC of zero).\n   It is important to\
    \ note that the Traceroute hop counts are NOT\n   related to the IP TTL.  A hop\
    \ count should only be incremented when\n   an ICMP Traceroute message is sent.\n"
- title: 3.2 Destination Node Operation
  contents:
  - "3.2 Destination Node Operation\n   When a node receives an Outbound Packet with\
    \ an IP Traceroute option,\n   the Return Packet, if such is required (e.g., ICMP\
    \ Echo\n   Request/Reply), should also carry that option.  The values in the ID\n\
    \   Number, OHC, and Originator Address fields should be copied into the\n   Return\
    \ Packet.  The value of the RHC field should be set to zero.\n   The destination\
    \ should NOT increment any hop counts or send any ICMP\n   Traceroute messages.\n"
- title: 3.3 Router Operation
  contents:
  - "3.3 Router Operation\n   When a router forwards a packet with an IP Traceroute\
    \ option, it\n   should send an ICMP Traceroute message to the host in the Originator\n\
    \   IP Address field of the option.  If the value of the RHC field is\n   0xFFFF\
    \ then the packet is an Outbound Packet and the OHC should be\n   incremented;\
    \ otherwise, the RHC field should be incremented.  The\n   Traceroute message\
    \ should reflect the incremented hop count.  The\n   Output Link Speed field should\
    \ be set to the speed, in OCTETS per\n   second, of the link over which the Outbound/Return\
    \ Packet will be\n   sent (e.g., 1,250,000 for an Ethernet) or zero if the output\
    \ link\n   speed cannot be determined.  The Output Link MTU field should be set\n\
    \   to the MTU of the link over which the Outbound/Return Packet will be\n   sent\
    \ or zero if the MTU cannot be determined.\n   The Outbound/Return Packet should\
    \ be forwarded as though the\n   Traceroute option did not exist; that is, it\
    \ should take the same\n   path to the destination as an optionless packet.\n\
    \   The ICMP Traceroute message should have the same TOS and Precedence\n   values\
    \ as the Outbound/Return Packet.  The TTL should be set to the\n   default defined\
    \ in \"Assigned Numbers\".\n   The ICMP Traceroute message should not carry the\
    \ IP Traceroute\n   option.\n   If the Outbound Packet cannot be forwarded, the\
    \ ICMP Traceroute\n   message should have a Code value of 1.  If the Return Packet\
    \ cannot\n   be forwarded because there is no route, then there is no need to\
    \ send\n   a Traceroute message since it could not be forwarded either.\n"
