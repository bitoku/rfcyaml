- title: Abstract
  contents:
  - "Abstract\n   On email systems that allow for 'subaddressing' or 'detailed\n \
    \  addressing' (e.g., \"ken+sieve@example.org\"), it is sometimes\n   desirable\
    \ to make comparisons against these sub-parts of addresses.\n   This document\
    \ defines an extension to the Sieve Email Filtering\n   Language that allows users\
    \ to compare against the user and detail\n   sub-parts of an address.\n"

- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   Subaddressing is the practice of augmenting the local-part\
    \ of an\n   [RFC2822] address with some 'detail' information in order to give\n\
    \   some extra meaning to that address.  One common way of encoding\n   'detail'\
    \ information into the local-part is to add a 'separator\n   character sequence',\
    \ such as \"+\", to form a boundary between the\n   'user' (original local-part)\
    \ and 'detail' sub-parts of the address,\n   much like the \"@\" character forms\
    \ the boundary between the local-part\n   and domain.\n   Typical uses of subaddressing\
    \ might be:\n   o  A message addressed to \"ken+sieve@example.org\" is delivered\
    \ into a\n      mailbox called \"sieve\" belonging to the user \"ken\".\n   o\
    \  A message addressed to \"5551212#123@example.com\" is delivered to\n      the\
    \ voice mailbox number \"123\" at phone number \"5551212\".\n   This document\
    \ describes an extension to the Sieve language defined by\n   [RFC5228] for comparing\
    \ against the 'user' and 'detail' sub-parts of\n   an address.\n"

    , \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\"\
    , \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n   document are to be interpreted as described\
    \ in [RFC2119].\n"
- title: 3.  Capability Identifier
  contents:
  - "3.  Capability Identifier\n   The capability string associated with the extension\
    \ defined in this\n   document is \"subaddress\".\n"
- title: 4.  Subaddress Comparisons
  contents:
  - "4.  Subaddress Comparisons\n   Test commands that act exclusively on addresses\
    \ may take the optional\n   tagged arguments \":user\" and \":detail\" to specify\
    \ what sub-part of\n   the local-part of the address will be acted upon.\n   \
    \   NOTE: In most cases, the envelope \"to\" address is the preferred\n      address\
    \ to examine for subaddress information when the desire is\n      to sort messages\
    \ based on how they were addressed so as to get to\n      a specific recipient.\
    \  The envelope address is, after all, the\n      reason a given message is being\
    \ processed by a given sieve script\n      for a given user.  This is particularly\
    \ true when mailing lists,\n      aliases, and 'virtual domains' are involved\
    \ since the envelope may\n      be the only source of detail information for the\
    \ specific\n      recipient.\n      NOTE: Because the encoding of detailed addresses\
    \ are site and/or\n      implementation specific, using the subaddress extension\
    \ on foreign\n      addresses (such as the envelope \"from\" address or originator\n\
    \      header fields) may lead to inconsistent or incorrect results.\n   The \"\
    :user\" argument specifies the user sub-part of the local-part of\n   an address.\
    \  If the address is not encoded to contain a detail sub-\n   part, then \":user\"\
    \ specifies the entire left side of the address\n   (equivalent to \":localpart\"\
    ).\n   The \":detail\" argument specifies the detail sub-part of the local-\n\
    \   part of an address.  If the address is not encoded to contain a\n   detail\
    \ sub-part, then the address fails to match any of the specified\n   keys.  If\
    \ a zero-length string is encoded as the detail sub-part,\n   then \":detail\"\
    \ resolves to the empty value (\"\").\n      NOTE: If the encoding method used\
    \ for detailed addresses utilizes\n      a separator character sequence, and the\
    \ separator character\n      sequence occurs more than once in the local-part,\
    \ then the logic\n      used to split the address is implementation-defined and\
    \ is usually\n      dependent on the format used by the encompassing mail system.\n\
    \   Implementations MUST make sure that the encoding method used for\n   detailed\
    \ addresses matches that which is used and/or allowed by the\n   encompassing\
    \ mail system, otherwise unexpected results might occur.\n   Note that the mechanisms\
    \ used to define and/or query the encoding\n   method used by the mail system\
    \ are outside the scope of this\n   document.\n   The \":user\" and \":detail\"\
    \ address parts are subject to the same rules\n   and restrictions as the standard\
    \ address parts defined in [RFC5228],\n   Section 2.7.4.\n   For convenience,\
    \ the \"ADDRESS-PART\" syntax element defined in\n   [RFC5228], Section 2.7.4,\
    \ is augmented here as follows:\n         ADDRESS-PART  =/  \":user\" / \":detail\"\
    \n   A diagram showing the ADDRESS-PARTs of an email address where the\n   detail\
    \ information follows a separator character sequence of \"+\" is\n   shown below:\n\
    \          :user \"+\" :detail  \"@\" :domain\n         \\-----------------/\n\
    \             :local-part\n   A diagram showing the ADDRESS-PARTs of a email address\
    \ where the\n   detail information precedes a separator character sequence of\
    \ \"--\" is\n   shown below:\n          :detail \"--\" :user  \"@\" :domain\n\
    \         \\------------------/\n             :local-part\n   Example (where the\
    \ detail information follows \"+\"):\n      require [\"envelope\", \"subaddress\"\
    , \"fileinto\"];\n      # In this example the same user account receives mail\
    \ for both\n      # \"ken@example.com\" and \"postmaster@example.com\"\n     \
    \ # File all messages to postmaster into a single mailbox,\n      # ignoring the\
    \ :detail part.\n      if envelope :user \"to\" \"postmaster\" {\n          fileinto\
    \ \"inbox.postmaster\";\n          stop;\n      }\n      # File mailing list messages\
    \ (subscribed as \"ken+mta-filters\").\n      if envelope :detail \"to\" \"mta-filters\"\
    \ {\n          fileinto \"inbox.ietf-mta-filters\";\n      }\n      # Redirect\
    \ all mail sent to \"ken+foo\".\n      if envelope :detail \"to\" \"foo\" {\n\
