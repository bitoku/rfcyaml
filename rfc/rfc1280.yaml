    \ process and the RFC document series\n   is presented first, followed by an explanation\
    \ of the terms.\n   Sections 6.2 - 6.9 contain the lists of protocols in each\
    \ stage of\n   standardization.  Finally come pointers to references and contacts\n\
    \   for further information.\n   This memo is intended to be issued quarterly;\
    \ please be sure the copy\n   you are reading is current.  Current copies may\
    \ be obtained from the\n   Network Information Center or from the Internet Assigned\
    \ Numbers\n   Authority (see the contact information at the end of this memo).\
    \  Do\n   not use this edition after 31-July-92.\n   See Section 6.1 for a description\
    \ of recent changes.  In the official\n   lists in sections 6.2 - 6.9, an asterisk\
    \ (*) next to a protocol\n   denotes that it is new to this document or has been\
    \ moved from one\n   protocol level to another, or differs from the previous edition\
    \ of\n   this document.\n1.  The Standardization Process\n   The Internet Activities\
    \ Board maintains this list of documents that\n   define standards for the Internet\
    \ protocol suite (see RFC-1160 for an\n   explanation of the role and organization\
    \ of the IAB and its\n   subsidiary groups, the Internet Engineering Task Force\
    \ (IETF) and the\n   Internet Research Task Force (IRTF)).  The IAB provides these\n\
    \   standards with the goal of co-ordinating the evolution of the\n   Internet\
    \ protocols; this co-ordination has become quite important as\n   the Internet\
    \ protocols are increasingly in general commercial use.\n   The definitive description\
    \ of the Internet standards process is found\n   in RFC-1310.\n   The majority\
    \ of Internet protocol development and standardization\n   activity takes place\
    \ in the working groups of the Internet\n   Engineering Task Force.\n   Protocols\
    \ which are to become standards in the Internet go through a\n   series of states\
    \ or maturity levels (proposed standard, draft\n   standard, and standard) involving\
    \ increasing amounts of scrutiny and\n   testing.  When a protocol completes this\
    \ process it is assigned a STD\n   number (see RFC-1311).  At each step, the Internet\
    \ Engineering\n   Steering Group (IESG) of the IETF must make a recommendation\
    \ for\n   advancement of the protocol and the IAB must ratify it.  If a\n   recommendation\
    \ is not ratified, the protocol is remanded to the IETF\n   for further work.\n\
    \   To allow time for the Internet community to consider and react to\n   standardization\
    \ proposals, the IAB imposes a minimum delay of 6\n   months before a proposed\
    \ standard can be advanced to a draft standard\n   and 4 months before a draft\
    \ standard can be promoted to standard.\n   It is general IAB practice that no\
    \ proposed standard can be promoted\n   to draft standard without at least two\
    \ independent implementations\n   (and the recommendation of the IESG).  Promotion\
    \ from draft standard\n   to standard generally requires operational experience\
    \ and\n   demonstrated interoperability of two or more implementations (and the\n\
    \   recommendation of the IESG).\n   In cases where there is uncertainty as to\
    \ the proper decision\n   concerning a protocol the IAB may convene a special\
    \ review committee\n   consisting of experts from the IETF, IRTF and the IAB with\
    \ the\n   purpose of recommending an explicit action to the IAB.\n   Advancement\
    \ of a protocol to proposed standard is an important step\n   since it marks a\
    \ protocol as a candidate for eventual standardization\n   (it puts the protocol\
    \ \"on the standards track\").  Advancement to\n   draft standard is a major step\
    \ which warns the community that, unless\n   major objections are raised or flaws\
    \ are discovered, the protocol is\n   likely to be advanced to standard in six\
    \ months.\n   Some protocols have been superseded by better ones or are otherwise\n\
    \   unused.  Such protocols are still documented in this memorandum with\n   the\
    \ designation \"historic\".\n   Because the IAB believes it is useful to document\
    \ the results of\n   early protocol research and development work, some of the\
    \ RFCs\n   document protocols which are still in an experimental condition.  The\n\
    \   protocols are designated \"experimental\" in this memorandum.  They\n   appear\
    \ in this report as a convenience to the community and not as\n   evidence of\
    \ their standardization.\n   Other protocols, such as those developed by other\
    \ standards\n   organizations, or by particular vendors, may be of interest or\
    \ may be\n   recommended for use in the Internet.  The specifications of such\n\
    \   protocols may be published as RFCs for the convenience of the\n   Internet\
    \ community.  These protocols are labeled \"informational\" in\n   this memorandum.\n\
    \   In addition to the working groups of the IETF, protocol development\n   and\
    \ experimentation may take place as a result of the work of the\n   research groups\
    \ of the Internet Research Task Force, or the work of\n   other individuals interested\
    \ in Internet protocol development.  The\n   IAB encourages the documentation\
    \ of such experimental work in the RFC\n   series, but none of this work is considered\
    \ to be on the track for\n   standardization until the IESG has made a recommendation\
    \ to advance\n   the protocol to the proposed standard state, and the IAB has\
    \ approved\n   this step.\n   A few protocols have achieved widespread implementation\
    \ without the\n   approval of the IESG and the IAB.  For example, some vendor\
    \ protocols\n   have become very important to the Internet community even though\
    \ they\n   have not been recommended by the IESG or ratified by the IAB.\n   However,\
    \ the IAB strongly recommends that the IAB standards process\n   be used in the\
    \ evolution of the protocol suite to maximize\n   interoperability (and to prevent\
    \ incompatible protocol requirements\n   from arising).  The IAB reserves the\
    \ use of the terms \"standard\",\n   \"draft standard\", and \"proposed standard\"\
    \ in any RFC or other\n   publication of Internet protocols to only those protocols\
    \ which the\n   IAB has approved.\n   In addition to a state (like \"Proposed\
    \ Standard\"), a protocol is also\n   assigned a status, or requirement level,\
    \ in this document.  The\n   possible requirement levels (\"Required\", \"Recommended\"\
    , \"Elective\",\n   \"Limited Use\", and \"Not Recommended\") are defined in Section\
    \ 4.2.\n   When a protocol is on the standards track, that is in the proposed\n\
    \   standard, draft standard, or standard state (see Section 5), the\n   status\
    \ shown in Section 6 is the current status.  For a proposed or\n   draft standard,\
    \ however, the IAB will also endeavor to indicate the\n   eventual status this\
    \ protocol will have after adoption as a standard.\n   Few protocols are required\
    \ to be implemented in all systems; this is\n   because there is such a variety\
    \ of possible systems, for example,\n   gateways, terminal servers, workstations,\
    \ and multi-user hosts.  The\n   requirement level shown in this document is only\
    \ a one word label,\n   which may not be sufficient to characterize the implementation\n\
    \   requirements for a protocol in all situations.  For some protocols,\n   this\
    \ document contains an additional status paragraph (an\n   applicability statement).\
    \  In addition, more detailed status\n   information is contained in separate\
    \ requirements documents (see\n   Section 3).\n2.  The Request for Comments Documents\n\
    \   The documents called Request for Comments (or RFCs) are the working\n   notes\
    \ of the \"Network Working Group\", that is the Internet research\n   and development\
    \ community.  A document in this series may be on\n   essentially any topic related\
    \ to computer communication, and may be\n   anything from a meeting report to\
    \ the specification of a standard.\n   Notice:\n      All standards are published\
    \ as RFCs, but not all RFCs specify\n      standards.\n   Anyone can submit a\
    \ document for publication as an RFC.  Submissions\n   must be made via electronic\
    \ mail to the RFC Editor (see the contact\n   information at the end of this memo,\
    \ and see RFC 1111).\n   While RFCs are not refereed publications, they do receive\
    \ technical\n   review from the task forces, individual technical experts, or\
    \ the RFC\n   Editor, as appropriate.\n   The RFC series comprises a wide range\
    \ of documents, ranging from\n   informational documents of general interests\
    \ to specifications of\n   standard Internet protocols.  In cases where submission\
    \ is intended\n   to document a proposed standard, draft standard, or standard\n\
    \   protocol, the RFC Editor will publish the document only with the\n   approval\
    \ of both the IESG and the IAB.  For documents describing\n   experimental work,\
    \ the RFC Editor will notify the IESG before\n   publication, allowing for the\
    \ possibility of review by the relevant\n   IETF working group or IRTF research\
    \ group and provide those comments\n   to the author.  See Section 5.1 for more\
    \ detail.\n   Once a document is assigned an RFC number and published, that RFC\
    \ is\n   never revised or re-issued with the same number.  There is never a\n\
    \   question of having the most recent version of a particular RFC.\n   However,\
    \ a protocol (such as File Transfer Protocol (FTP)) may be\n   improved and re-documented\
    \ many times in several different RFCs.  It\n   is important to verify that you\
    \ have the most recent RFC on a\n   particular protocol.  This \"IAB Official\
    \ Protocol Standards\" memo is\n   the reference for determining the correct RFC\
    \ for the current\n   specification of each protocol.\n   The RFCs are available\
    \ from the Network Information Center at SRI\n   International, and a number of\
    \ other sites.  For more information\n   about obtaining RFCs, see Sections 7.4\
    \ and 7.5.\n3.  Other Reference Documents\n   There are three other reference\
    \ documents of interest in checking the\n   current status of protocol specifications\
    \ and standardization.  These\n   are the Assigned Numbers, the Gateway Requirements,\
    \ and the Host\n   Requirements.  Note that these documents are revised and updated\
    \ at\n   different times; in case of differences between these documents, the\n\
    \   most recent must prevail.\n   Also, one should be aware of the MIL-STD publications\
    \ on IP, TCP,\n   Telnet, FTP, and SMTP.  These are described in Section 3.4.\n\
    3.1.  Assigned Numbers\n   This document lists the assigned values of the parameters\
    \ used in the\n   various protocols.  For example, IP protocol codes, TCP port\
    \ numbers,\n   Telnet Option Codes, ARP hardware types, and Terminal Type names.\n\
    \   Assigned Numbers was most recently issued as RFC-1060.\n   Another document,\
    \ Internet Numbers, lists the assigned IP network\n   numbers, and the autonomous\
    \ system numbers.  Internet Numbers was\n   most recently issued as RFC-1166.\n\
    3.2.  Gateway Requirements\n   This document reviews the specifications that apply\
    \ to gateways and\n   supplies guidance and clarification for any ambiguities.\
    \  Gateway\n   Requirements is RFC-1009.  A working group of the IETF is actively\n\
    \   preparing a revision.\n3.3.  Host Requirements\n   This pair of documents\
    \ reviews and updates the specifications that\n   apply to hosts, and it supplies\
    \ guidance and clarification for any\n   ambiguities.  Host Requirements was issued\
    \ as RFC-1122 and RFC-1123.\n3.4.  The MIL-STD Documents\n   The Internet community\
    \ specifications for IP (RFC-791) and TCP (RFC-\n   793) and the DoD MIL-STD specifications\
    \ are intended to describe\n   exactly the same protocols.  Any difference in\
    \ the protocols\n   specified by these sets of documents should be reported to\
    \ DCA and to\n   the IAB.  The RFCs and the MIL-STDs for IP and TCP differ in\
    \ style\n   and level of detail.  It is strongly advised that the two sets of\n\
    \   documents be used together, along with RFC-1122 and RFC-1123.\n   The IAB\
    \ and the DoD MIL-STD specifications for the FTP, SMTP, and\n   Telnet protocols\
    \ are essentially the same documents (RFCs 765, 821,\n   854).  The MIL-STD versions\
    \ have been edited slightly.  Note that the\n   current Internet specification\
    \ for FTP is RFC-959 (as modified by\n   RFC-1123).\n   Note that these MIL-STD\
    \ are now somewhat out of date.  The Gateway\n   Requirements (RFC-1009) and Host\
    \ Requirements (RFC-1122, RFC-1123)\n   take precedence over both earlier RFCs\
    \ and the MIL-STDs.\n          Internet Protocol (IP)                      MIL-STD-1777\n\
    \          Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)         MIL-STD-1778\n        \
    \  File Transfer Protocol (FTP)                MIL-STD-1780\n          Simple\
    \ Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP)        MIL-STD-1781\n          Telnet Protocol\
    \ and Options (TELNET)        MIL-STD-1782\n   These documents are available from\
    \ the Naval Publications and Forms\n   Center.  Requests can be initiated by telephone,\
    \ telegraph, or mail;\n   however, it is preferred that private industry use form\
    \ DD1425, if\n   possible.  These five documents are included in the 1985 DDN\
    \ Protocol\n   Handbook (available from the SRI Network Information Systems Center,\n\
    \   see Section 7.6).\n          Naval Publications and Forms Center, Code 3015\n\

    4.  Explanation of Terms\n   There are two independent categorization of protocols.\
    \  The first is\n   the \"maturity level\" or STATE of standardization, one of\
    \ \"standard\",\n   \"draft standard\", \"proposed standard\", \"experimental\"\
    ,\n   \"informational\" or \"historic\".  The second is the \"requirement level\"\
    \n   or STATUS of this protocol, one of \"required\", \"recommended\",\n   \"\
    elective\", \"limited use\", or \"not recommended\".\n   The status or requirement\
    \ level is difficult to portray in a one word\n   label.  These status labels\
    \ should be considered only as an\n   indication, and a further description, or\
    \ applicability statement,\n   should be consulted.\n   When a protocol is advanced\
    \ to proposed standard or draft standard,\n   it is labeled with a current status\
    \ and when possible, the IAB also\n   notes the status that the protocol is expected\
    \ to have when it\n   reaches the standard state.\n   At any given time a protocol\
    \ occupies a cell of the following matrix.\n   Protocols are likely to be in cells\
    \ in about the following\n   proportions (indicated by the relative number of\
    \ Xs).  A new protocol\n   is most likely to start in the (proposed standard,\
    \ elective) cell, or\n   the (experimental, not recommended) cell.\n         \

    \   What is a \"system\"?\n      Some protocols are particular to hosts and some\
    \ to gateways; a few\n      protocols are used in both.  The definitions of the\
    \ terms below\n      will refer to a \"system\" which is either a host or a gateway\
    \ (or\n      both).  It should be clear from the context of the particular\n \
    \     protocol which types of systems are intended.\n4.1.  Definitions of Protocol\
    \ State\n   Every protocol listed in this document is assigned to a \"maturity\n\
    \   level\" or STATE of standardization: \"standard\", \"draft standard\",\n \
    \  \"proposed standard\", \"experimental\", or \"historic\".\n   4.1.1.  Standard\
    \ Protocol\n      The IAB has established this as an official standard protocol\
    \ for\n      the Internet.  These protocols are assigned STD numbers (see RFC-\n\
    \      1311).  These are separated into two groups: (1) IP protocol and\n    \
    \  above, protocols that apply to the whole Internet; and (2)\n      network-specific\
    \ protocols, generally specifications of how to do\n      IP on particular types\
    \ of networks.\n   4.1.2.  Draft Standard Protocol\n      The IAB is actively\
    \ considering this protocol as a possible\n      Standard Protocol.  Substantial\
    \ and widespread testing and comment\n      are desired.  Comments and test results\
    \ should be submitted to the\n      IAB.  There is a possibility that changes\
    \ will be made in a Draft\n      Standard Protocol before it becomes a Standard\
    \ Protocol.\n   4.1.3.  Proposed Standard Protocol\n      These are protocol proposals\
    \ that may be considered by the IAB for\n      standardization in the future.\
    \  Implementation and testing by\n      several groups is desirable.  Revision\
    \ of the protocol\n      specification is likely.\n   4.1.4.  Experimental Protocol\n\
    \      A system should not implement an experimental protocol unless it\n    \
    \  is participating in the experiment and has coordinated its use of\n      the\
    \ protocol with the developer of the protocol.\n      Typically, experimental\
    \ protocols are those that are developed as\n      part of an ongoing research\
    \ project not related to an operational\n      service offering.  While they may\
    \ be proposed as a service\n      protocol at a later stage, and thus become proposed\
    \ standard,\n      draft standard, and then standard protocols, the designation\
    \ of a\n      protocol as experimental may sometimes be meant to suggest that\n\
    \      the protocol, although perhaps mature, is not intended for\n      operational\
    \ use.\n   4.1.5.  Informational Protocol\n      Protocols developed by other\
    \ standard organizations, or vendors,\n      or that are for other reasons outside\
    \ the purview of the IAB, may\n      be published as RFCs for the convenience\
    \ of the Internet community\n      as informational protocols.  Such protocols\
    \ may in some cases also\n      be recommended for use in the Internet by the\
    \ IAB.\n   4.1.6.  Historic Protocol\n      These are protocols that are unlikely\
    \ to ever become standards in\n      the Internet either because they have been\
    \ superseded by later\n      developments or due to lack of interest.\n4.2.  Definitions\
    \ of Protocol Status\n      This document lists a \"requirement level\" or STATUS\
    \ for each\n      protocol.  The status is one of \"required\", \"recommended\"\
    ,\n      \"elective\", \"limited use\", or \"not recommended\".\n   4.2.1.  Required\
    \ Protocol\n      A system must implement the required protocols.\n   4.2.2. \
    \ Recommended Protocol\n      A system should implement the recommended protocols.\n\
    \   4.2.3.  Elective Protocol\n      A system may or may not implement an elective\
    \ protocol. The\n      general notion is that if you are going to do something\
    \ like this,\n      you must do exactly this.  There may be several elective protocols\n\
    \      in a general area, for example, there are several electronic mail\n   \
    \   protocols, and several routing protocols.\n   4.2.4.  Limited Use Protocol\n\
    \      These protocols are for use in limited circumstances.  This may be\n  \
    \    because of their experimental state, specialized nature, limited\n      functionality,\
    \ or historic state.\n   4.2.5.  Not Recommended Protocol\n      These protocols\
    \ are not recommended for general use.  This may be\n      because of their limited\
    \ functionality, specialized nature, or\n      experimental or historic state.\n\
    5.  The Standards Track\n   This section discusses in more detail the procedures\
    \ used by the RFC\n   Editor and the IAB in making decisions about the labeling\
    \ and\n   publishing of protocols as standards.\n5.1.  The RFC Processing Decision\
    \ Table\n   Here is the current decision table for processing submissions by the\n\

    \ Directors or Working Group Chairs may be considered in the same\n   way as documents\
    \ from \"other\".\n5.2.  The Standards Track Diagram\n   There is a part of the\
    \ STATUS and STATE categorization that is called\n   the standards track.  Actually,\
    \ only the changes of state are\n   significant to the progression along the standards\
    \ track, though the\n   status assignments may be changed as well.\n   The states\
    \ illustrated by single line boxes are temporary states,\n   those illustrated\
    \ by double line boxes are long term states.  A\n   protocol will normally be\
    \ expected to remain in a temporary state for\n   several months (minimum six\
    \ months for proposed standard, minimum\n   four months for draft standard). \
    \ A protocol may be in a long term\n   state for many years.\n   A protocol may\
    \ enter the standards track only on the recommendation\n   of the IESG and by\
    \ action of the IAB; and may move from one state to\n   another along the track\
    \ only on the recommendation of the IESG and by\n   action of the IAB.  That is,\
    \ it takes both the IESG and the IAB to\n   either start a protocol on the track\
    \ or to move it along.\n   Generally, as the protocol enters the standards track\
    \ a decision is\n   made as to the eventual STATUS, requirement level or applicability\n\
    \   (elective, recommended, or required) the protocol will have, although\n  \
    \ a somewhat less stringent current status may be assigned, and it then\n   is\
    \ placed in the the proposed standard STATE with that status.  So\n   the initial\
    \ placement of a protocol is into state 1.  At any time the\n   STATUS decision\
    \ may be revisited.\n         |\n         +<----------------------------------------------+\n\

    \ proposed standard (1) to draft standard (2) can\n   only be by action of the\
    \ IAB on the recommendation of the IESG and\n   only after the protocol has been\
    \ proposed standard (1) for at least\n   six months.\n   The transition from draft\
    \ standard (2) to standard (3) can only be by\n   action of the IAB on the recommendation\
    \ of the IESG and only after\n   the protocol has been draft standard (2) for\
    \ at least four months.\n   Occasionally, the decision may be that the protocol\
    \ is not ready for\n   standardization and will be assigned to the experimental\
    \ state (4).\n   This is off the standards track, and the protocol may be resubmitted\n\
    \   to enter the standards track after further work.  There are other\n   paths\
    \ into the experimental and historic states that do not involve\n   IAB action.\n\
    \   Sometimes one protocol is replaced by another and thus becomes\n   historic,\
    \ or it may happen that a protocol on the standards track is\n   in a sense overtaken\

    \ Statements:\n   IGMP -- The Internet Activities Board intends to move towards\
    \ general\n   adoption of IP multicasting, as a more efficient solution than\n\
    \   broadcasting for many applications.  The host interface has been\n   standardized\
    \ in RFC-1112; however, multicast-routing gateways are in\n   the experimental\
    \ stage and are not widely available.  An Internet\n   host should support all\
    \ of RFC-1112, except for the IGMP protocol\n   itself which is optional; see\
    \ RFC-1122 for more details.  Even\n   without IGMP, implementation of RFC-1112\
    \ will provide an important\n   advance: IP-layer access to local network multicast\
    \ addressing.  It\n   is expected that IGMP will become recommended for all hosts\
    \ and\n   gateways at some future date.\n   SMI, MIB-II SNMP -- The Internet Activities\
    \ Board recommends that all\n   IP and TCP implementations be network manageable.\
    \  At the current\n   time, this implies implementation of the Internet MIB-II\
    \ (RFC-1213),\n   and at least the recommended management protocol SNMP (RFC-1157).\n\

    \ -- The Routing Information Protocol (RIP) is widely implemented\n   and used\
    \ in the Internet.  However, both implementors and users\n   should be aware that\
    \ RIP has some serious technical limitations as a\n   routing protocol.  The IETF\
    \ is currently developing several\n   candidates for a new standard \"open\" routing\
    \ protocol with better\n   properties than RIP.  The IAB urges the Internet community\
    \ to track\n   these developments, and to implement the new protocol when it is\n\
    \   standardized; improved Internet service will result for many users.\n   TP-TCP\
    \ -- As OSI protocols become more widely implemented and used,\n   there will\
    \ be an increasing need to support interoperation with the\n   TCP/IP protocols.\
    \  The Internet Engineering Task Force is formulating\n   strategies for interoperation.\
    \  RFC-1006 provides one interoperation\n   mode, in which TCP/IP is used to emulate\
    \ TP0 in order to support OSI\n   applications.  Hosts that wish to run OSI connection-oriented\n\
    \   applications in this mode should use the procedure described in RFC-\n   1006.\
    \  In the future, the IAB expects that a major portion of the\n   Internet will\
    \ support both TCP/IP and OSI (inter-)network protocols\n   in parallel, and it\
    \ will then be possible to run OSI applications\n   across the Internet using\
    \ full OSI protocol \"stacks\".\n   PPP -- Point to Point Protocol is a method\
    \ of sending IP over serial\n   lines, which are a type of physical network. \
    \ It is anticipated that\n   PPP will be advanced to the network-specific standard\
    \ protocol state\n   in the future.\n6.5.  Proposed Standard Protocols\nProtocol\
