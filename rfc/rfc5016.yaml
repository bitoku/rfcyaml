  - "1.  Introduction\n   DomainKeys Identified Mail [RFC4871] defines a message level\
    \ signing\n   and verification mechanism for email.  While a DKIM signed message\n\
    \   speaks for itself, there is ambiguity if a message doesn't have a\n   valid\
    \ first party signature (i.e., on behalf of the [RFC2822].From\n   address): is\
    \ this to be expected or not?  For email, this is an\n   especially difficult\
    \ problem since there is no expectation of a\n   priori knowledge of a sending\
    \ domain's practices.  This ambiguity can\n   be used to mount a bid down attack\
    \ that is inherent with systems like\n   email that allow optional authentication:\
    \ if a receiver doesn't know\n   otherwise, it should not assume that the lack\
    \ of a valid signature is\n   exceptional without other information.  Thus, an\
    \ attacker can take\n   advantage of the ambiguity and simply not sign messages.\
    \  If a\n   protocol could be developed for a domain to publish its DKIM signing\n\
    \   practices, a message verifier could take that into account when it\n   receives\
    \ an unsigned piece of email.\n   This document defines the requirements for a\
    \ mechanism that permits\n   the publication of Sender Signing Practices (SSP).\
    \  The document is\n   organized into two main sections: first, a Problem and\
    \ Deployment\n   Scenario section that describes the problems that SSP is intended\
    \ to\n   address as well as the deployment issues surrounding the base\n   problems,\
    \ and the second section is the Requirements that arise\n   because of those scenarios.\n"

  - "2.  Definitions and Requirements Language\n   o  Domain Holder: the entity that\
    \ controls the contents of the DNS\n      subtree starting at the domain, either\
    \ directly or by delegation\n      via NS records it controls.\n   o  First Party\
    \ Address: for DKIM, a first party address is defined to\n      be the [RFC2822].From\
    \ address in the message header; a first party\n      address is also known as\
    \ an Author address.\n   o  First Party Signature: a first party signature is\

    \      than one SMTP hop away.\n   o  DKIM Signing Complete: a practice where\

  contents:
  - "3.  SSP Problem Scenarios\n   The email world is a diverse place with many deployment\n\
    \   considerations.  This section outlines expected usage scenarios where\n  \
    \ DKIM signing/verifying will take place, and how a new protocol might\n   help\
    \ to clarify the relevance of DKIM-signed mail.\n"
- title: '3.1.  Problem Scenario 1: Is All Mail Signed with DKIM?'
  contents:
  - "3.1.  Problem Scenario 1: Is All Mail Signed with DKIM?\n   After auditing their\
    \ outgoing mail and deploying DKIM signing for all\n   of their legitimate outgoing\
    \ mail, a domain could be said to be DKIM\n   signing complete.  That is, the\
    \ domain has, to the best of its\n   ability, ensured that all legitimate mail\
    \ purporting to have come\n   from that domain contains a valid DKIM signature.\n\
    \   A receiver in the general case doesn't know what the practices are\n   for\
    \ a given domain.  Thus, the receiver is at a disadvantage in not\n   knowing\
    \ whether or not it should expect all mail to be signed from a\n   given domain.\
    \  This knowledge gap leads to a trivially exploitable\n   bid-down attack where\
    \ the attacker merely sends unsigned mail; since\n   the receiver doesn't know\
    \ the practices of the signing domain, it\n   cannot treat the message any more\
    \ harshly for lack of a valid\n   signature.\n   An information service that allows\
    \ a receiver to query for the\n   practices and expectations of the first party\
    \ domain when no valid\n   first party signature is found could be useful in closing\
    \ this gap.\n   A receiver could use this information to treat such questionable\
    \ mail\n   with varying degrees of prejudice.\n   Note that, for the foreseeable\
    \ future, unrestricted use patterns of\n   mail (e.g., where users may be members\
    \ of mailing lists, etc.) will\n   likely suffer occasional, non-malicious signature\
    \ failure in transit.\n   While probably not a large percentage of total traffic,\
    \ this kind of\n   breakage may be a significant concern for those usage patterns.\
    \  This\n   scenario defines where the sender cannot set any expectation as to\n\
    \   whether an individual message will arrive intact.\n   Even without that expectation,\
    \ a receiver may be able to take\n   advantage of the knowledge that the domain's\
    \ practice is to sign all\n   mail and bias its filters against unsigned or damaged\
    \ in transit\n   mail.  This information should not be expected to be used in\
    \ a binary\n   yes/no fashion, but instead as a data point among others in a\n\
    \   filtering system.\n   The following exchange illustrates problem scenario\
    \ 1.\n   1.  Mail with a [RFC2822].From domain Alice is sent to domain Bob\n \
    \      with a missing or broken DKIM first party signature from Alice.\n   2.\
    \  Domain Bob would like to know whether that is an expected state\n       of\
    \ affairs.\n   3.  Domain Alice provides information that it signs all outgoing\n\
    \       mail, but places no expectation on whether it will arrive with an\n  \
    \     intact first party signature.\n   4.  Domain Bob could use this information\
    \ to bias its filters to\n       examine the message with some suspicion.\n"
- title: '3.2.  Problem Scenario 2: Illegitimate Domain Name Use'
  contents:
  - "3.2.  Problem Scenario 2: Illegitimate Domain Name Use\n   A class of mail typified\
    \ by transactional mail from high-value\n   domains is currently the target of\
    \ phishing attacks.  In particular,\n   many phishing scams forge the [RFC2822].From\
    \ address in addition to\n   spoofing much of the content to trick unsuspecting\
    \ users into\n   revealing sensitive information.  Domain holders sending this\
    \ mail\n   would like the ability to give an enhanced guarantee that mail sent\n\
    \   with their domain name should always arrive with the proof that the\n   domain\
    \ holder consented to its transmission.  That is, the message\n   should contain\
    \ a valid first party signature as defined above.\n   From a receiver's standpoint,\
    \ knowing that a domain not only signs\n   all of its mail, but places a very\
    \ high value on the receipt of a\n   valid first party signature from that domain\
    \ is helpful.  Hence, a\n   receiver knows that the sending domain signs all its\
    \ mail, and that\n   the sending domain considers mail from this domain particularly\n\
    \   sensitive in some sense, and is asking the receiver to be more\n   suspicious\
    \ than it otherwise might be of a broken or missing first-\n   party signature.\
    \  A receiver with the knowledge of the sender's\n   expectations in hand might\
    \ choose to process messages not conforming\n   to the published practices in\
    \ a special manner.  Note that the\n   ability to state an enhanced guarantee\
    \ of a valid signature means\n   that senders should expect mail that traverses\
    \ modifying\n   intermediaries (e.g., mailing lists, etc.) will likely be quarantined\n\
    \   or deleted; thus, this scenario is more narrow than problem scenario\n   1.\n\
    \      Informative Note: a receiving filter may choose to treat scenario\n   \
    \   2 much more harshly than scenario 1; where scenario 1 looks odd,\n      scenario\
    \ 2 looks like something is very wrong.\n   1.  Mail with a [RFC2822].From domain\
    \ Alice is sent to domain Bob\n       with a missing or broken first party DKIM\
    \ signature from domain\n       Alice.\n   2.  Domain Bob would like to know whether\
    \ that is an expected state\n       of affairs.\n   3.  Domain Alice provides\
    \ information that it signs all outgoing\n       mail, and furthermore places\
    \ an expectation that it should arrive\n       with an intact first party signature,\
    \ and that the receiver\n       should be much more wary if it does not.\n   4.\
    \  Domain Bob could use this information to bias its filters such\n       that\
    \ it examines the message with great suspicion.\n"
- title: 4.  SSP Deployment Considerations
  contents:
  - "4.  SSP Deployment Considerations\n   Given the problems enumerated above for\
    \ which we'd like SSP to\n   provide information to recipients, there are a number\
    \ of scenarios\n   that are not related to the problems that are to be solved,\
    \ per se,\n   but the actual mechanics of implementing/deploying the information\n\
    \   service that SSP would provide.\n"
- title: '4.1.  Deployment Consideration 1: Outsourced Signing'
  contents:
  - "4.1.  Deployment Consideration 1: Outsourced Signing\n   Many domains do not\
    \ run their own mail infrastructure, or may\n   outsource parts of it to third\
    \ parties.  It is desirable for a domain\n   holder to have the ability to delegate\
    \ to other entities the ability\n   to sign for the domain holder.  One obvious\
    \ use scenario is a domain\n   holder from a small domain that needs to have the\
    \ ability for their\n   outgoing ISP to sign all of their mail on behalf of the\
    \ domain\n   holder.  Other use scenarios include outsourced bulk mail for\n \
    \  marketing campaigns, as well as outsourcing various business\n   functions,\
    \ such as insurance benefits, etc.\n"
- title: '4.2.  Deployment Consideration 2: Subdomain Coverage'
  contents:
  - "4.2.  Deployment Consideration 2: Subdomain Coverage\n   An SSP client will perform\
    \ lookups on incoming mail streams to\n   provide the information as proposed\
    \ in the problem scenarios.  The\n   domain part of the first address of the [RFC2822].From\
    \ will form the\n   basis to fetch the published information.  A trivial attack\
    \ to\n   circumvent finding the published information can be mounted by simply\n\
    \   using a subdomain of the parent domain that doesn't have published\n   information.\
    \  This attack is called the subdomain attack: that is, a\n   domain wants to\
    \ not only publish a policy for a given DNS label it\n   controls, but it would\
    \ also like to protect all subdomains of that\n   label as well.  If this characteristic\
    \ is not met, an attacker would\n   need only create a possibly fictitious subdomain\
    \ that was not covered\n   by the SSP's information service.  Thus, it would be\
    \ advantageous for\n   SSP to not only cover a given domain, but all subdomains\
    \ of that\n   domain as well.\n"
- title: '4.3.  Deployment Consideration 3: Resent Original Mail'
  contents:
  - "4.3.  Deployment Consideration 3: Resent Original Mail\n   Resent mail is a common\
    \ occurrence in many scenarios in the email\n   world of today.  For example,\
    \ domain Alice sends a DKIM-signed\n   message with a published practice of signing\
    \ all messages to domain\n   Bob's mailing list.  Bob, being a good net citizen,\
    \ wants to be able\n   to take his part of the responsibility of the message in\
    \ question, so\n   he DKIM signs the message, perhaps corresponding to the Sender\n\
    \   address.\n   Note that this scenario is completely orthogonal to whether Alice's\n\
    \   signature survived Bob's mailing list: Bob merely wants to assert his\n  \
    \ part in the chain of accountability for the benefit of the ultimate\n   receivers.\
    \  It would be useful for this practice to be encouraged as\n   it gives a more\
    \ accurate view of who handled the message.  It also\n   has the side benefit\
    \ that remailers that break DKIM first party\n   signatures can be potentially\
    \ assessed by the receiver based on the\n   receiver's opinion of the signing\
    \ domains that actually survived.\n"
- title: '4.4.  Deployment Consideration 4: Incremental Deployment of Signing'
  contents:
  - "4.4.  Deployment Consideration 4: Incremental Deployment of Signing\n   As a\
    \ practical matter, it may be difficult for a domain to roll out\n   DKIM signing\
    \ such that they can publish the DKIM Signing Complete\n   practice given the\
    \ complexities of the user population, the\n   outsourced vendors sending on its\
    \ behalf, etc.  This leaves open an\n   exploit that high-value mail, such as\
    \ in Problem Scenario 2, must be\n   classified to the least common denominator\
    \ of the published\n   practices.  It would be desirable to allow a domain holder\
    \ to publish\n   a list of exceptions that would have a more restrictive practices\n\
    \   statement.  NB: this consideration has been deemed met by the\n   mechanisms\
    \ provided by the base DKIM signing mechanism; it is merely\n   documented here\
    \ as having been an issue.\n   For example, bigbank.example.com might be ready\
    \ to say that\n   statements@bigbank.example.com is always signed, but the rest\
    \ of the\n   domain, say, is not.  Another situation is that the practices of\
    \ some\n   address local parts in a given domain are not the same as practices\n\
    \   of other local parts.  Using the same example of\n   statements@bigbank.example.com\
    \ being a transactional kind of email\n   that would like to publish very strong\
    \ practices, mixed in with the\n   rest of the user population local parts, which\
    \ may go through mailing\n   lists, etc., for which a less strong statement is\
    \ appropriate.\n   It should be said that DKIM, through the use of subdomains,\
    \ can\n   already support this kind of differentiation.  That is, in order to\n\
    \   publish a strong practice, one only has to segregate those cases into\n  \
    \ different subdomains.  For example: accounts.bigbank.example.com\n   would publish\
    \ constrained practices, while\n   corporateusers.bigbank.example.com might publish\
    \ more permissive\n   practices.\n"

  contents:
  - "4.5.  Deployment Consideration 5: Performance and Caching\n   Email service provides\
    \ an any-any mesh of potential connections: all\n   that is required is the publication\
    \ of an MX record and an SMTP\n   listener to receive mail.  Thus, the use of\
    \ SSP is likely to fall\n   into two main scenarios, the first of which are large,\
    \ well-known\n   domains that are in constant contact with one another.  In this\
    \ case,\n   caching of records is essential for performance, including the\n \
    \  caching of the non-existence of records (i.e., negative caching).\n   The second\
    \ main scenario is when a domain exchanges mail with a much\n   smaller volume\
    \ domain.  This scenario can be both perfectly normal as\n   with the case of\

    \ section, a practice is a statement\n   according to the [RFC2822].From domain\
    \ holder of externally\n   verifiable behavior in the email messages it sends.\
    \  As an example, a\n   practice might be defined such that all email messages\
    \ will contain a\n   DKIM signature corresponding to the [RFC2822].From address.\
    \  Since\n   there is a possibility of alteration between what a sender sends\
    \ and\n   a receiver examines, an expectation combines with a practice to\n  \
    \ convey what the [RFC2822].From domain considers the likely outcome of\n   the\
    \ survivability of the practice at a receiver.  For example, a\n   practice that\
    \ a valid DKIM for the [RFC2822].From address is present\n   when it is sent from\
    \ the domain, and an expectation that it will\n   remain present and valid for\
    \ all receivers whether topologically\n   adjacent or not.\n   1.  SSP MUST be\
    \ able to make practices and expectation assertions\n       about the domain part\
    \ of a [RFC2822].From address in the context\n       of DKIM.  SSP will not make\
    \ assertions about other addresses for\n       DKIM at this time.\n         Refs:\
    \ Problem Scenarios 1 and 2, Sections 3.1 and 3.2.\n   2.  SSP MUST provide a\
    \ concise linkage between the [RFC2822].From and\n       the identity in the DKIM\
    \ i= tag, or its default if it is missing\n       in the signature.  That is,\
    \ SSP MUST precisely define the\n       semantics of what qualifies as a first\
    \ party signature.\n         Refs: Problem Scenarios 1 and 2, Sections 3.1 and\
    \ 3.2.\n   3.  SSP MUST be able to publish a practice that the domain's signing\n\
    \       behavior is \"DKIM Signing Complete\".  That is, all messages were\n \
    \      transmitted with a valid first party signature.\n         Refs: Problem\
    \ Scenario 1, Section 3.1.\n   4.  SSP MUST be able to publish an expectation\
    \ that a verifiable\n       first party DKIM signature should be expected on receipt\
    \ of a\n       message.\n         Refs: Problem Scenario 2, Section 3.2.\n   5.\
    \  Practices and expectations MUST be presented in SSP syntax using\n       as\
    \ intuitive a descriptor as possible.  For example, p=? would be\n       better\
    \ represented as p=unknown.\n         Refs: Deployment Consideration, Section\
    \ 4.6.\n   6.  Because DKIM uses DNS to store selectors, there is always the\n\
    \       ability for a domain holder to delegate all or parts of the\n       _domainkey\
    \ subdomain to an affiliated party of the domain\n       holder's choosing.  That\
    \ is, the domain holder may set an NS\n       record for _domainkey.example.com\
    \ to delegate to an email\n       provider who manages the entire namespace. \
    \ There is also the\n       ability for the domain holder to partition its namespace\
    \ into\n       subdomains to further constrain third parties.  For example, a\n\
    \       domain holder could delegate only _domainkey.benefits.example.com\n  \
    \     to a third party to constrain the third party to only be able to\n     \
    \  produce valid signatures in the benefits.example.com subdomain.\n       Last,\
    \ a domain holder can even use CNAME's to delegate individual\n       leaf nodes.\
    \  Given the above considerations, SSP need not invent\n       a different means\
    \ of allowing affiliated parties to sign on a\n       domain's behalf at this\
    \ time.\n         Refs: Deployment Consideration, Section 4.4.\n   7.  Practices\
    \ and expectations MUST be presented as an information\n       service from the\
    \ signing domain to be consumed as an added factor\n       to the receiver's local\
    \ policy.  In particular, a practice or\n       expectation MUST NOT mandate any\
    \ disposition stance on the\n       receiver.\n         Refs: Problem Scenarios\
    \ 1 and 2, Sections 3.1 and 3.2.\n   8.  There is no requirement that SSP publish\
    \ practices of any/all\n       third parties that MUST NOT sign on the domain\
    \ holder's behalf.\n       This should be considered out of scope.\n         INFORMATIVE\
    \ NOTE: this is essentially saying that the protocol\n         doesn't have to\
    \ concern itself with being a blacklist\n         repository.\n         Refs:\
    \ Problem Scenarios 1 and 2, Sections 3.1 and 3.2.\n   9.  SSP MUST NOT be required\
    \ to be invoked if a valid first party\n       signature is found.\n         Refs:\
    \ Deployment Consideration, Section 4.2.\n   10. SSP MUST NOT provide a mechanism\
    \ that impugns the existence of\n       non-first party signatures in a message.\
    \  A corollary of this\n       requirement is that the protocol MUST NOT link\
    \ practices of first\n       party signers with the practices of third party signers.\n\
    \         INFORMATIVE NOTE: the main thrust of this requirement is that\n    \
    \     practices should only be published for that which the publisher\n      \
    \   has control, and should not meddle in what is ultimately the\n         local\
    \ policy of the receiver.\n         Refs: Deployment Consideration, Section 4.3.\n"
