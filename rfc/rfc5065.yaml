  - "Abstract\n   The Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) is an inter-autonomous system\n\
    \   routing protocol designed for Transmission Control Protocol/Internet\n   Protocol\
    \ (TCP/IP) networks.  BGP requires that all BGP speakers\n   within a single autonomous\
    \ system (AS) must be fully meshed.  This\n   represents a serious scaling problem\
    \ that has been well documented in\n   a number of proposals.\n   This document\
    \ describes an extension to BGP that may be used to\n   create a confederation\
    \ of autonomous systems that is represented as a\n   single autonomous system\
    \ to BGP peers external to the confederation,\n   thereby removing the \"full\
    \ mesh\" requirement.  The intention of this\n   extension is to aid in policy\
    \ administration and reduce the\n   management complexity of maintaining a large\
    \ autonomous system.\n   This document obsoletes RFC 3065.\n"

- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   As originally defined, BGP requires that all BGP speakers\
    \ within a\n   single AS must be fully meshed.  The result is that for n BGP\n\
    \   speakers within an AS, n*(n-1)/2 unique Internal BGP (IBGP) sessions\n   are\
    \ required.  This \"full mesh\" requirement clearly does not scale\n   when there\
    \ are a large number of IBGP speakers within the autonomous\n   system, as is\
    \ common in many networks today.\n   This scaling problem has been well documented\
    \ and a number of\n   proposals have been made to alleviate this, such as [RFC2796]\
    \ and\n   [RFC1863] (made historic by [RFC4223]).  This document presents\n  \
    \ another alternative alleviating the need for a \"full mesh\" and is\n   known\
    \ as \"Autonomous System Confederations for BGP\", or simply, \"BGP\n   confederations\"\
    .  It has also been observed that BGP confederations\n   may provide improvements\
    \ in routing policy control.\n   This document is a revision of, and obsoletes,\
    \ [RFC3065], which is\n   itself a revision of [RFC1965].  It includes editorial\
    \ changes,\n   terminology clarifications, and more explicit protocol specifications\n\
    \   based on extensive implementation and deployment experience with BGP\n   Confederations.\n"

- title: 2.  Discussion
  contents:
  - "2.  Discussion\n   It may be useful to subdivide autonomous systems with a very\
    \ large\n   number of BGP speakers into smaller domains for purposes of\n   controlling\
    \ routing policy via information contained in the BGP\n   AS_PATH attribute. \
    \ For example, one may choose to consider all BGP\n   speakers in a geographic\
    \ region as a single entity.\n   In addition to potential improvements in routing\
    \ policy control, if\n   techniques such as those presented here or in [RFC4456]\
    \ are not\n   employed, [BGP-4] requires BGP speakers in the same autonomous system\n\
    \   to establish a full mesh of TCP connections among all speakers for\n   the\
    \ purpose of exchanging exterior routing information.  In\n   autonomous systems,\
    \ the number of intra-domain connections that need\n   to be maintained by each\
    \ border router can become significant.\n   Subdividing a large autonomous system\
    \ allows a significant reduction\n   in the total number of intra-domain BGP connections,\
    \ as the\n   connectivity requirements simplify to the model used for inter-domain\n\
    \   connections.\n   Unfortunately, subdividing an autonomous system may increase\
    \ the\n   complexity of routing policy based on AS_PATH information for all\n\
    \   members of the Internet.  Additionally, this division increases the\n   maintenance\
    \ overhead of coordinating external peering when the\n   internal topology of\
    \ this collection of autonomous systems is\n   modified.\n   Therefore, division\
    \ of an autonomous system into separate systems may\n   adversely affect optimal\
    \ routing of packets through the Internet.\n   However, there is usually no need\
    \ to expose the internal topology of\n   this divided autonomous system, which\
    \ means it is possible to regard\n   a collection of autonomous systems under\
    \ a common administration as a\n   single entity or autonomous system, when viewed\
    \ from outside the\n   confines of the confederation of autonomous systems itself.\n"
- title: 3.  AS_CONFED Segment Type Extension
  contents:
  - "3.  AS_CONFED Segment Type Extension\n   Currently, BGP specifies that the AS_PATH\
    \ attribute is a well-known\n   mandatory attribute that is composed of a sequence\
    \ of AS path\n   segments.  Each AS path segment is represented by a triple <path\n\
    \   segment type, path segment length, path segment value>.\n   In [BGP-4], the\
    \ path segment type is a 1-octet field with the two\n   following values defined:\n\
    \   Value     Segment Type\n     1       AS_SET: unordered set of autonomous systems\
    \ that a route in\n             the UPDATE message has traversed\n     2     \
    \  AS_SEQUENCE: ordered set of autonomous systems that a route\n             in\
    \ the UPDATE message has traversed\n   This document specifies two additional\
    \ segment types:\n     3       AS_CONFED_SEQUENCE: ordered set of Member Autonomous\n\
    \             Systems in the local confederation that the UPDATE message\n   \
    \          has traversed\n     4       AS_CONFED_SET: unordered set of Member\
    \ Autonomous Systems\n             in the local confederation that the UPDATE\
    \ message has\n             traversed\n"
- title: 4.  Operation
  contents:
  - "4.  Operation\n   A member of a BGP confederation MUST use its AS Confederation\n\
    \   Identifier in all transactions with peers that are not members of its\n  \
    \ confederation.  This AS Confederation Identifier is the \"externally\n   visible\"\
    \ AS number, and this number is used in OPEN messages and\n   advertised in the\
    \ AS_PATH attribute.\n   A member of a BGP confederation MUST use its Member-AS\
    \ Number in all\n   transactions with peers that are members of the same confederation\
    \ as\n   the local BGP speaker.\n   A BGP speaker receiving an AS_PATH attribute\
    \ containing an autonomous\n   system matching its own AS Confederation Identifier\
    \ SHALL treat the\n   path in the same fashion as if it had received a path containing\
    \ its\n   own AS number.\n   A BGP speaker receiving an AS_PATH attribute containing\
    \ an\n   AS_CONFED_SEQUENCE or AS_CONFED_SET that contains its own Member-AS\n\
    \   Number SHALL treat the path in the same fashion as if it had received\n  \
    \ a path containing its own AS number.\n"
- title: 4.1.  AS_PATH Modification Rules
  contents:
  - "4.1.  AS_PATH Modification Rules\n   When implementing BGP confederations, Section\
    \ 5.1.2 of [BGP-4] is\n   replaced with the following text:\n   AS_PATH is a well-known\
    \ mandatory attribute.  This attribute\n   identifies the autonomous systems through\
    \ which routing information\n   carried in this UPDATE message has passed.  The\
    \ components of this\n   list can be AS_SETs, AS_SEQUENCEs, AS_CONFED_SETs or\n\
    \   AS_CONFED_SEQUENCES.\n   When a BGP speaker propagates a route it learned\
    \ from another BGP\n   speaker's UPDATE message, it modifies the route's AS_PATH\
    \ attribute\n   based on the location of the BGP speaker to which the route will\
    \ be\n   sent:\n   a) When a given BGP speaker advertises the route to another\
    \ BGP\n      speaker located in its own Member-AS, the advertising speaker\n \
    \     SHALL NOT modify the AS_PATH attribute associated with the route.\n   b)\
    \ When a given BGP speaker advertises the route to a BGP speaker\n      located\
    \ in a neighboring autonomous system that is a member of the\n      local confederation,\
    \ the advertising speaker updates the AS_PATH\n      attribute as follows:\n \
    \     1) if the first path segment of the AS_PATH is of type\n         AS_CONFED_SEQUENCE,\
    \ the local system prepends its own Member-AS\n         number as the last element\
    \ of the sequence (put it in the\n         leftmost position with respect to the\
    \ position of octets in the\n         protocol message).  If the act of prepending\
    \ will cause an\n         overflow in the AS_PATH segment (i.e., more than 255\
    \ ASs), it\n         SHOULD prepend a new segment of type AS_CONFED_SEQUENCE and\n\
    \         prepend its own AS number to this new segment.\n      2) if the first\
    \ path segment of the AS_PATH is not of type\n         AS_CONFED_SEQUENCE, the\
    \ local system prepends a new path\n         segment of type AS_CONFED_SEQUENCE\
    \ to the AS_PATH, including\n         its own Member-AS Number in that segment.\n\
    \      3) if the AS_PATH is empty, the local system creates a path\n         segment\
    \ of type AS_CONFED_SEQUENCE, places its own Member-AS\n         Number into that\
    \ segment, and places that segment into the\n         AS_PATH.\n   c) When a given\
    \ BGP speaker advertises the route to a BGP speaker\n      located in a neighboring\
    \ autonomous system that is not a member of\n      the local confederation, the\
    \ advertising speaker SHALL update the\n      AS_PATH attribute as follows:\n\
    \      1) if any path segments of the AS_PATH are of the type\n         AS_CONFED_SEQUENCE\
    \ or AS_CONFED_SET, those segments MUST be\n         removed from the AS_PATH\
    \ attribute, leaving the sanitized\n         AS_PATH attribute to be operated\
    \ on by steps 2, 3 or 4.\n      2) if the first path segment of the remaining\
    \ AS_PATH is of type\n         AS_SEQUENCE, the local system prepends its own\
    \ AS Confederation\n         Identifier as the last element of the sequence (put\
    \ it in the\n         leftmost position with respect to the position of octets\
    \ in the\n         protocol message).  If the act of prepending will cause an\n\
    \         overflow in the AS_PATH segment (i.e., more than 255 ASs), it\n    \
    \     SHOULD prepend a new segment of type AS_SEQUENCE and prepend\n         its\
    \ own AS number to this new segment.\n      3) if the first path segment of the\
    \ remaining AS_PATH is of type\n         AS_SET, the local system prepends a new\
    \ path segment of type\n         AS_SEQUENCE to the AS_PATH, including its own\
    \ AS Confederation\n         Identifier in that segment.\n      4) if the remaining\
    \ AS_PATH is empty, the local system creates a\n         path segment of type\
    \ AS_SEQUENCE, places its own AS\n         Confederation Identifier into that\
    \ segment, and places that\n         segment into the AS_PATH.\n   When a BGP\
    \ speaker originates a route then:\n   a) the originating speaker includes its\
    \ own AS Confederation\n      Identifier in a path segment, of type AS_SEQUENCE,\
    \ in the AS_PATH\n      attribute of all UPDATE messages sent to BGP speakers\
    \ located in\n      neighboring autonomous systems that are not members of the\
    \ local\n      confederation.  In this case, the AS Confederation Identifier of\n\
    \      the originating speaker's autonomous system will be the only entry\n  \
    \    the path segment, and this path segment will be the only segment\n      in\
    \ the AS_PATH attribute.\n   b) the originating speaker includes its own Member-AS\
    \ Number in a\n      path segment, of type AS_CONFED_SEQUENCE, in the AS_PATH\
    \ attribute\n      of all UPDATE messages sent to BGP speakers located in neighboring\n\
    \      Member Autonomous Systems that are members of the local\n      confederation.\
    \  In this case, the Member-AS Number of the\n      originating speaker's autonomous\
    \ system will be the only entry the\n      path segment, and this path segment\
    \ will be the only segment in\n      the AS_PATH attribute.\n   c) the originating\
    \ speaker includes an empty AS_PATH attribute in all\n      UPDATE messages sent\
    \ to BGP speakers residing within the same\n      Member-AS.  (An empty AS_PATH\
    \ attribute is one whose length field\n      contains the value zero).\n   Whenever\
    \ the modification of the AS_PATH attribute calls for\n   including or prepending\
    \ the AS Confederation Identifier or Member-AS\n   Number of the local system,\
    \ the local system MAY include/prepend more\n   than one instance of that value\
    \ in the AS_PATH attribute.  This is\n   controlled via local configuration.\n"

- title: Appendix A.  Aggregate Routing Information
  contents:
  - "Appendix A.  Aggregate Routing Information\n   As a practical matter, aggregation\
    \ as discussed in [BGP-4], Section\n   9.2.2.2, is not generally employed within\
    \ confederations.  However,\n   in the event that such aggregation is performed\
    \ within a\n   confederation, the rules of [BGP-4] should be followed, making\
    \ the\n   necessary substitutions between AS_SET and AS_CONFED_SET and\n   similarly,\
    \ AS_SEQUENCE and AS_CONFED_SEQUENCE.  Confederation-type\n   segments (AS_CONFED_SET\
    \ and AS_CONFED_SEQUENCE) MUST be kept separate\n   from non-confederation segments\
    \ (AS_SET and AS_SEQUENCE).  An\n   implementation could also choose to provide\
    \ a form of aggregation\n   wherein non-confederation segments are aggregated\
    \ as discussed in\n   [BGP-4], Section 9.2.2.2, and confederation-type segments\
    \ are not\n   aggregated.\n   Support for aggregation of confederation-type segments\
    \ is not\n   mandatory.\n"
- title: Appendix B.  Changes from RFC 3065
  contents:
  - "Appendix B.  Changes from RFC 3065\n   The primary trigger for an update to RFC\
    \ 3065 was regarding issues\n   associated with AS path segment handling, in particular\
    \ what to do\n   when interacting with BGP peers external to a confederation and\
    \ to\n   ensure AS_CONFED_[SET|SEQUENCE] segment types are not propagated to\n\
    \   peers outside of a confederation.\n   As such, the \"Error Handling\" section\
    \ above was added and applies not\n   only to BGP confederation speakers, but\
    \ to all BGP speakers.\n   Other changes are mostly trivial and surrounding some\
    \ clarification\n   and consistency in terminology and denoting that\n   AS_CONFED_[SET|SEQUENCE]\
    \ Segment Type handling should be just as it\n   is in the base BGP specification\
    \ [BGP-4].\n"
