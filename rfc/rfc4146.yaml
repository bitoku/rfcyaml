- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   There is a long-standing technique supported by a large\
    \ number of\n   mail servers that allows users to be notified of new mail.  In\n\
    \   addition to server support, there are a number of clients that\n   support\
    \ this, ranging from full email clients to specialized clients\n   whose only\
    \ purpose is to receive new mail notifications and alert a\n   mail client.  This\
    \ technique is sometimes known as \"notify mail\"\n   (after a shareware client\
    \ of the same name), \"biff\", and the \"finger\n   hack\".\n"
- title: 2.  Conventions Used in This Document
  contents:
  - "2.  Conventions Used in This Document\n   In examples, \"C:\" indicates lines\
    \ sent by the client, and \"S:\"\n   indicates those sent by the server.  Line\
    \ breaks within a command\n   example are for editorial purposes only.  Line breaks\
    \ in the protocol\n   are indicated by \"CRLF\".\n"
- title: 3.  Simple Mail Notification
  contents:
  - "3.  Simple Mail Notification\n   With this technique, the server sends the string\
    \ \"nm_notifyuser\"\n   immediately followed by CRLF to the finger port on the\
    \ IP address for\n   the user who has received new mail.  The finger port is 79.\
    \  Note\n   that only the port for finger is used; the finger protocol itself\
    \ is\n   not used.\n   The IP address to use may be configured, or the server\
    \ may use the IP\n   address that was last used to check mail by the user.  Typically,\n\
    \   this is a per-account configuration option.\n   On the client system, a process\
    \ must be listening to the finger port\n   to be useful.  When it receives the\
    \ \"nm_notifyuser\" string, it takes\n   a configured action, typically instructing\
    \ a mail client to fetch\n   mail.\n   Normally, a TCP connection to the target\
    \ computer is opened, the\n   \"nm_notifyuser\" string is sent, and the connection\
    \ is closed without\n   waiting for a response.\n   In some cases, UDP is used\
    \ instead of TCP, but the default and\n   general practice is TCP.  Even though\
    \ only a single message in one\n   direction is sent (with no reply), TCP is used\
    \ most often, probably\n   for reliability.\n   There is an assumption that the\
    \ client listening on an IP address\n   only has responsibility for one email\
    \ account.  If a client can check\n   multiple accounts and receives the \"nm_notifyuser\"\
    \ string, it does\n   not know which account received the mail.\n   There is a\
    \ requirement that a finger daemon not be active on the\n   client.\n"
- title: 4.  Example
  contents:
  - "4.  Example\n   This example assumes that new mail has arrived at the server\n\
    \   mail.isp.example.com for account fastness@example.net.  The server\n   has\
    \ determined an IP address to which notification should be sent.\n      C: <listens\
    \ on TCP port 79>\n      S: <opens TCP connection to IP address port 79>\n   \
    \   C: <accepts inbound connection on port 79>\n      S: nm_notifyuserCRLF\n \
    \     S: <closes TCP connection>\n"
- title: 5.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "5.  Security Considerations\n   There is no assurance that the \"nm_notifyuser\"\
    \ message is being sent\n   to the correct IP address.  Nor does the listening\
    \ agent on the\n   client system have any assurance that an \"nm_notifyuser\"\
    \ string was\n   sent by a mail server that has received new mail for the user.\n\
    \   It is trivial for an attacker to send large numbers of\n   \"nm_notifyuser\"\
    \ messages to a targeted system.  Client systems that\n   are listening for this\
    \ message SHOULD implement protections against\n   being flooded with notifications.\
    \  Many server systems already\n   implement protections against users logging\
    \ in and checking mail too\n   frequently.\n   Because use of this protocol requires\
    \ that a port be open with an\n   agent listening on it, if that agent contains\
    \ vulnerabilities, it may\n   create a remotely exploitable attack (for example,\
    \ buffer overflows\n   that permit an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the\
    \ client\n   system with the permissions of the agent).  As usual, with a process\n\
    \   listening on a port, the process should execute with the least\n   possible\
    \ privilege level and access.\n"
