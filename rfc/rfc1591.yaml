  - "1. Introduction\n   This memo provides some information on the structure of the\
    \ names in\n   the Domain Name System (DNS), specifically the top-level domain\n\
    \   names; and on the administration of domains.  The Internet Assigned\n   Numbers\
    \ Authority (IANA) is the overall authority for the IP\n   Addresses, the Domain\
    \ Names, and many other parameters, used in the\n   Internet.  The day-to-day\
    \ responsibility for the assignment of IP\n   Addresses, Autonomous System Numbers,\
    \ and most top and second level\n   Domain Names are handled by the Internet Registry\
    \ (IR) and regional\n   registries.\n"
- title: 2.  The Top Level Structure of the Domain Names
  contents:
  - "2.  The Top Level Structure of the Domain Names\n   In the Domain Name System\
    \ (DNS) naming of computers there is a\n   hierarchy of names.  The root of system\
    \ is unnamed.  There are a set\n   of what are called \"top-level domain names\"\
    \ (TLDs).  These are the\n   generic TLDs (EDU, COM, NET, ORG, GOV, MIL, and INT),\
    \ and the two\n   letter country codes from ISO-3166.  It is extremely unlikely\
    \ that\n   any other TLDs will be created.\n   Under each TLD may be created a\
    \ hierarchy of names.  Generally, under\n   the generic TLDs the structure is\
    \ very flat.  That is, many\n   organizations are registered directly under the\
    \ TLD, and any further\n   structure is up to the individual organizations.\n\
    \   In the country TLDs, there is a wide variation in the structure, in\n   some\
    \ countries the structure is very flat, in others there is\n   substantial structural\
    \ organization.  In some country domains the\n   second levels are generic categories\
    \ (such as, AC, CO, GO, and RE),\n   in others they are based on political geography,\
    \ and in still others,\n   organization names are listed directly under the country\
    \ code.  The\n   organization for the US country domain is described in RFC 1480\
    \ [1].\n   Each of the generic TLDs was created for a general category of\n  \
    \ organizations.  The country code domains (for example, FR, NL, KR,\n   US) are\
    \ each organized by an administrator for that country.  These\n   administrators\
    \ may further delegate the management of portions of the\n   naming tree.  These\
    \ administrators are performing a public service on\n   behalf of the Internet\
    \ community.  Descriptions of the generic\n   domains and the US country domain\
    \ follow.\n   Of these generic domains, five are international in nature, and\
    \ two\n   are restricted to use by entities in the United States.\n   World Wide\
    \ Generic Domains:\n   COM - This domain is intended for commercial entities,\
    \ that is\n         companies.  This domain has grown very large and there is\n\
    \         concern about the administrative load and system performance if\n  \
    \       the current growth pattern is continued.  Consideration is\n         being\
    \ taken to subdivide the COM domain and only allow future\n         commercial\
    \ registrations in the subdomains.\n   EDU - This domain was originally intended\
    \ for all educational\n         institutions.  Many Universities, colleges, schools,\n\
    \         educational service organizations, and educational consortia\n     \
    \    have registered here.  More recently a decision has been taken\n        \
    \ to limit further registrations to 4 year colleges and\n         universities.\
    \  Schools and 2-year colleges will be registered\n         in the country domains\
    \ (see US Domain, especially K12 and CC,\n         below).\n   NET - This domain\
    \ is intended to hold only the computers of network\n         providers, that\
    \ is the NIC and NOC computers, the\n         administrative computers, and the\
    \ network node computers.  The\n         customers of the network provider would\
    \ have domain names of\n         their own (not in the NET TLD).\n   ORG - This\
    \ domain is intended as the miscellaneous TLD for\n         organizations that\
    \ didn't fit anywhere else.  Some non-\n         government organizations may\
    \ fit here.\n   INT - This domain is for organizations established by international\n\
    \         treaties, or international databases.\n   United States Only Generic\
    \ Domains:\n   GOV - This domain was originally intended for any kind of government\n\
    \         office or agency.  More recently a decision was taken to\n         register\
    \ only agencies of the US Federal government in this\n         domain.  State\
    \ and local agencies are registered in the country\n         domains (see US Domain,\
    \ below).\n   MIL - This domain is used by the US military.\n   Example country\
    \ code Domain:\n   US - As an example of a country domain, the US domain provides\
    \ for\n        the registration of all kinds of entities in the United States\n\
    \        on the basis of political geography, that is, a hierarchy of\n      \
    \  <entity-name>.<locality>.<state-code>.US.  For example,\n        \"IBM.Armonk.NY.US\"\
    .  In addition, branches of the US domain are\n        provided within each state\
    \ for schools (K12), community colleges\n        (CC), technical schools (TEC),\
    \ state government agencies\n        (STATE), councils of governments (COG),libraries\
    \ (LIB), museums\n        (MUS), and several other generic types of entities (see\
    \ RFC 1480\n        for details [1]).\n   To find a contact for a TLD use the\
    \ \"whois\" program to access the\n   database on the host rs.internic.net.  Append\
    \ \"-dom\" to the name of\n   TLD you are interested in.  For example:\n     \
    \                  whois -h rs.internic.net us-dom\n      or\n               \
    \        whois -h rs.internic.net edu-dom\n"
- title: 3.  The Administration of Delegated Domains
  contents:
  - "3.  The Administration of Delegated Domains\n   The Internet Assigned Numbers\
    \ Authority (IANA) is responsible for the\n   overall coordination and management\
    \ of the Domain Name System (DNS),\n   and especially the delegation of portions\
    \ of the name space called\n   top-level domains.  Most of these top-level domains\
    \ are two-letter\n   country codes taken from the ISO standard 3166.\n   A central\
    \ Internet Registry (IR) has been selected and designated to\n   handled the bulk\
    \ of the day-to-day administration of the Domain Name\n   System.  Applications\
    \ for new top-level domains (for example, country\n   code domains) are handled\
    \ by the IR with consultation with the IANA.\n   The central IR is INTERNIC.NET.\
    \  Second level domains in COM, EDU,\n   ORG, NET, and GOV are registered by the\
    \ Internet Registry at the\n   InterNIC.  The second level domains in the MIL\
    \ are registered by the\n   DDN registry at NIC.DDN.MIL.  Second level names in\
    \ INT are\n   registered by the PVM at ISI.EDU.\n   While all requests for new\
    \ top-level domains must be sent to the\n   Internic (at hostmaster@internic.net),\
    \ the regional registries are\n   often enlisted to assist in the administration\
    \ of the DNS, especially\n   in solving problems with a country administration.\
    \  Currently, the\n   RIPE NCC is the regional registry for Europe and the APNIC\
    \ is the\n   regional registry for the Asia-Pacific region, while the INTERNIC\n\
    \   administers the North America region, and all the as yet undelegated\n   regions.\n\
    \      The contact mailboxes for these regional registries are:\n         INTERNIC\
    \        hostmaster@internic.net\n         APNIC           hostmaster@apnic.net\n\
    \         RIPE NCC        ncc@ripe.net\n   The policy concerns involved when a\
    \ new top-level domain is\n   established are described in the following.  Also\
    \ mentioned are\n   concerns raised when it is necessary to change the delegation\
    \ of an\n   established domain from one party to another.\n   A new top-level\
    \ domain is usually created and its management\n   delegated to a \"designated\
    \ manager\" all at once.\n   Most of these same concerns are relevant when a sub-domain\
    \ is\n   delegated and in general the principles described here apply\n   recursively\
    \ to all delegations of the Internet DNS name space.\n   The major concern in\
    \ selecting a designated manager for a domain is\n   that it be able to carry\
    \ out the necessary responsibilities, and have\n   the ability to do a equitable,\
    \ just, honest, and competent job.\n   1) The key requirement is that for each\
    \ domain there be a designated\n      manager for supervising that domain's name\
    \ space.  In the case of\n      top-level domains that are country codes this\
    \ means that there is\n      a manager that supervises the domain names and operates\
    \ the domain\n      name system in that country.\n      The manager must, of course,\
    \ be on the Internet.  There must be\n      Internet Protocol (IP) connectivity\
    \ to the nameservers and email\n      connectivity to the management and staff\
    \ of the manager.\n      There must be an administrative contact and a technical\
    \ contact\n      for each domain.  For top-level domains that are country codes\
    \ at\n      least the administrative contact must reside in the country\n    \
    \  involved.\n   2) These designated authorities are trustees for the delegated\n\
    \      domain, and have a duty to serve the community.\n      The designated manager\
    \ is the trustee of the top-level domain for\n      both the nation, in the case\
    \ of a country code, and the global\n      Internet community.\n      Concerns\
    \ about \"rights\" and \"ownership\" of domains are\n      inappropriate.  It\
    \ is appropriate to be concerned about\n      \"responsibilities\" and \"service\"\
    \ to the community.\n   3) The designated manager must be equitable to all groups\
    \ in the\n      domain that request domain names.\n      This means that the same\
    \ rules are applied to all requests, all\n      requests must be processed in\
    \ a non-discriminatory fashion, and\n      academic and commercial (and other)\
    \ users are treated on an equal\n      basis.  No bias shall be shown regarding\
    \ requests that may come\n      from customers of some other business related\
    \ to the manager --\n      e.g., no preferential service for customers of a particular\
    \ data\n      network provider.  There can be no requirement that a particular\n\
    \      mail system (or other application), protocol, or product be used.\n   \
    \   There are no requirements on subdomains of top-level domains\n      beyond\
    \ the requirements on higher-level domains themselves.  That\n      is, the requirements\
    \ in this memo are applied recursively.  In\n      particular, all subdomains\
    \ shall be allowed to operate their own\n      domain name servers, providing\
    \ in them whatever information the\n      subdomain manager sees fit (as long\
    \ as it is true and correct).\n   4) Significantly interested parties in the domain\
    \ should agree that\n      the designated manager is the appropriate party.\n\
    \      The IANA tries to have any contending parties reach agreement\n      among\
    \ themselves, and generally takes no action to change things\n      unless all\
    \ the contending parties agree; only in cases where the\n      designated manager\
    \ has substantially mis-behaved would the IANA\n      step in.\n      However,\
    \ it is also appropriate for interested parties to have\n      some voice in selecting\
    \ the designated manager.\n      There are two cases where the IANA and the central\
    \ IR may\n      establish a new top-level domain and delegate only a portion of\n\
    \      it: (1) there are contending parties that cannot agree, or (2) the\n  \
    \    applying party may not be able to represent or serve the whole\n      country.\
    \  The later case sometimes arises when a party outside a\n      country is trying\
    \ to be helpful in getting networking started in a\n      country -- this is sometimes\
    \ called a \"proxy\" DNS service.\n      The Internet DNS Names Review Board (IDNB),\
    \ a committee\n      established by the IANA, will act as a review panel for cases\
    \ in\n      which the parties can not reach agreement among themselves.  The\n\
    \      IDNB's decisions will be binding.\n   5) The designated manager must do\
    \ a satisfactory job of operating the\n      DNS service for the domain.\n   \
    \   That is, the actual management of the assigning of domain names,\n      delegating\
    \ subdomains and operating nameservers must be done with\n      technical competence.\
    \  This includes keeping the central IR (in\n      the case of top-level domains)\
    \ or other higher-level domain\n      manager advised of the status of the domain,\
    \ responding to\n      requests in a timely manner, and operating the database\
    \ with\n      accuracy, robustness, and resilience.\n      There must be a primary\
    \ and a secondary nameserver that have IP\n      connectivity to the Internet\
    \ and can be easily checked for\n      operational status and database accuracy\
    \ by the IR and the IANA.\n      In cases when there are persistent problems with\
    \ the proper\n      operation of a domain, the delegation may be revoked, and\
    \ possibly\n      delegated to another designated manager.\n   6) For any transfer\
    \ of the designated manager trusteeship from one\n      organization to another,\
    \ the higher-level domain manager (the IANA\n      in the case of top-level domains)\
    \ must receive communications from\n      both the old organization and the new\
    \ organization that assure the\n      IANA that the transfer in mutually agreed,\
    \ and that the new\n      organization understands its responsibilities.\n   \
    \   It is also very helpful for the IANA to receive communications\n      from\
    \ other parties that may be concerned or affected by the\n      transfer.\n"

    \ Codes\n      The IANA is not in the business of deciding what is and what is\n\
    \      not a country.\n      The selection of the ISO 3166 list as a basis for\
