  - "1.  Introduction\n   There are several approaches for providing IPv6 connectivity\
    \ over an\n   MPLS core network [RFC4029] including (i) requiring that MPLS\n\
    \   networks support setting up IPv6-signaled Label Switched Paths (LSPs)\n  \
    \ and establish IPv6 connectivity by using those LSPs, (ii) use\n   configured\
    \ tunneling over IPv4-signaled LSPs, or (iii) use the IPv6\n   Provider Edge (6PE)\
    \ approach defined in this document.\n   The 6PE approach is required as an alternative\
    \ to the use of standard\n   tunnels.  It provides a solution for an MPLS environment\
    \ where all\n   tunnels are established dynamically, thereby addressing environments\n\
    \   where the effort to configure and maintain explicitly configured\n   tunnels\
    \ is not acceptable.\n   This document specifies operations of the 6PE approach\
    \ for\n   interconnection of IPv6 islands over an IPv4 MPLS cloud.  The\n   approach\
    \ requires that the edge routers connected to IPv6 islands be\n   Dual Stack Multiprotocol-BGP-speaking\
    \ routers [RFC4760], while the\n   core routers are only required to run IPv4\
    \ MPLS.  The approach uses\n   MP-BGP over IPv4, relies on identification of the\
    \ 6PE routers by\n   their IPv4 address, and uses IPv4-signaled MPLS LSPs that\
    \ do not\n   require any explicit tunnel configuration.\n   Throughout this document,\
    \ the terminology of [RFC2460] and [RFC4364]\n   is used.\n   In this document\
    \ an 'IPv6 island' is a network running native IPv6 as\n   per [RFC2460].  A typical\
    \ example of an IPv6 island would be a\n   customer's IPv6 site connected via\
    \ its IPv6 Customer Edge (CE) router\n   to one (or more) Dual Stack Provider\
    \ Edge router(s) of a Service\n   Provider.  These IPv6 Provider Edge routers\
    \ (6PE) are connected to an\n   IPv4 MPLS core network.\n            +--------+\n\

    \                                  Figure 1\n   The interconnection method described\
    \ in this document typically\n   applies to an Internet Service Provider (ISP)\
    \ that has an IPv4 MPLS\n   network, that is familiar with BGP (possibly already\
    \ offering\n   BGP/MPLS VPN services), and that wants to offer IPv6 services to\
    \ some\n   of its customers.  However, the ISP may not (yet) want to upgrade its\n\
    \   network core to IPv6, nor use only IPv6-over-IPv4 tunneling.  With\n   the\
    \ 6PE approach described here, the provider only has to upgrade\n   some Provider\
    \ Edge (PE) routers to Dual Stack operations so that they\n   behave as 6PE routers\
    \ (and route reflectors if those are used for the\n   exchange of IPv6 reachability\
    \ among 6PE routers) while leaving the\n   IPv4 MPLS core routers untouched. \
    \ These 6PE routers provide\n   connectivity to IPv6 islands.  They may also provide\
    \ other services\n   simultaneously (IPv4 connectivity, IPv4 L3VPN services, L2VPN\n\
    \   services, etc.).  Also with the 6PE approach, no tunnels need to be\n   explicitly\
    \ configured, and no IPv4 headers need to be inserted in\n   front of the IPv6\
    \ packets between the customer and provider edge.\n   The ISP obtains IPv6 connectivity\
    \ to its peers and upstreams using\n   means outside of the scope of this document,\
    \ and its 6PE routers\n   readvertise it over the IPv4 MPLS core with MP-BGP.\n\
    \   The interface between the edge router of the IPv6 island (Customer\n   Edge\
    \ (CE) router) and the 6PE router is a native IPv6 interface which\n   can be\
    \ physical or logical.  A routing protocol (IGP or EGP) may run\n   between the\
    \ CE router and the 6PE router for the distribution of IPv6\n   reachability information.\
    \  Alternatively, static routes and/or a\n   default route may be used on the\
    \ 6PE router and the CE router to\n   control reachability.  An IPv6 island may\
    \ connect to the provider\n   network over more than one interface.\n   The 6PE\
    \ approach described in this document can be used for customers\n   that already\
    \ have an IPv4 service from the network provider and\n   additionally require\
    \ an IPv6 service, as well as for customers that\n   require only IPv6 connectivity.\n\
    \   The scenario is also described in [RFC4029].\n   Note that the 6PE approach\
    \ specified in this document provides global\n   IPv6 reachability.  Support of\
    \ IPv6 VPNs is not within the scope of\n   this document and is addressed in [RFC4659].\n\
    \   Deployment of the 6PE approach over an existing IPv4 MPLS cloud does\n   not\
    \ require an introduction of new mechanisms in the core (other than\n   potentially\
    \ those described at the end of Section 3 for dealing with\n   dynamic MTU discovery).\
    \  Configuration and operations of the 6PE\n   approach have a lot of similarities\
    \ with the configuration and\n   operations of an IPv4 VPN service ([RFC4364])\
    \ or IPv6 VPN service\n   ([RFC4659]) over an IPv4 MPLS core because they all\
    \ use MP-BGP to\n   distribute non-IPv4 reachability information for transport\
    \ over an\n   IPv4 MPLS Core.  However, the configuration and operations of the\
    \ 6PE\n   approach is somewhat simpler, since it does not involve all the VPN\n\
    \   concepts such as Virtual Routing and Forwarding (VRFs) tables.\n"

- title: 2.  Protocol Overview
  contents:
  - "2.  Protocol Overview\n   Each IPv6 site is connected to at least one Provider\
    \ Edge router that\n   is located on the border of the IPv4 MPLS cloud.  We call\
    \ such a\n   router a 6PE router.  The 6PE router MUST be dual stack IPv4 and\n\
    \   IPv6.  The 6PE router MUST be configured with at least one IPv4\n   address\
    \ on the IPv4 side and at least one IPv6 address on the IPv6\n   side.  The configured\
    \ IPv4 address needs to be routable in the IPv4\n   cloud, and there needs to\
    \ be a label bound via an IPv4 label\n   distribution protocol to this IPv4 route.\n\
    \   As a result of this, every considered 6PE router knows which MPLS\n   label\
    \ to use to send packets to any other 6PE router.  Note that an\n   MPLS network\
    \ offering BGP/MPLS IP VPN services already fulfills these\n   requirements.\n\
    \   No extra routes need to be injected in the IPv4 cloud.\n   We call the 6PE\
    \ router receiving IPv6 packets from an IPv6 site an\n   ingress 6PE router (relative\
    \ to these IPv6 packets).  We call a 6PE\n   router forwarding IPv6 packets to\
    \ an IPv6 site an egress 6PE router\n   (relative to these IPv6 packets).\n  \
    \ Interconnecting IPv6 islands over an IPv4 MPLS cloud takes place\n   through\
    \ the following steps:\n   1. Exchange IPv6 reachability information among 6PE\
    \ routers with MP-\n      BGP [RFC2545]:\n      The 6PE routers MUST exchange\
    \ the IPv6 prefixes over MP-BGP\n      sessions as per [RFC2545] running over\
    \ IPv4.  The MP-BGP Address\n      Family Identifier (AFI) used MUST be IPv6 (value\
    \ 2).  In doing so,\n      the 6PE routers convey their IPv4 address as the BGP\
    \ Next Hop for\n      the advertised IPv6 prefixes.  The IPv4 address of the egress\
    \ 6PE\n      router MUST be encoded as an IPv4-mapped IPv6 address in the BGP\n\
    \      Next Hop field.  This encoding is consistent with the definition\n    \
    \  of an IPv4-mapped IPv6 address in [RFC4291] as an \"address type\n      used\
    \ to represent the address of IPv4 nodes as IPv6 addresses\".\n      In addition,\
    \ the 6PE MUST bind a label to the IPv6 prefix as per\n      [RFC3107].  The Subsequence\
    \ Address Family Identifier (SAFI) used\n      in MP-BGP MUST be the \"label\"\
    \ SAFI (value 4) as defined in\n      [RFC3107].  Rationale for this and label\
    \ allocation policies are\n      discussed in Section 3.\n   2. Transport IPv6\
    \ packets from the ingress 6PE router to the egress\n      6PE router over IPv4-signaled\
    \ LSPs:\n      The ingress 6PE router MUST forward IPv6 data over the IPv4-\n\
    \      signaled LSP towards the egress 6PE router identified by the IPv4\n   \
    \   address advertised in the IPv4-mapped IPv6 address of the BGP Next\n     \
    \ Hop for the corresponding IPv6 prefix.\n   As required by the BGP specification\
    \ [RFC4271], PE routers form a\n   full peering mesh unless Route Reflectors are\
    \ used.\n"
- title: 3.  Transport over IPv4-signaled LSPs and IPv6 Label Binding
  contents:
  - "3.  Transport over IPv4-signaled LSPs and IPv6 Label Binding\n   In this approach,\
    \ the IPv4-mapped IPv6 addresses allow a 6PE router\n   that has to forward an\
    \ IPv6 packet to automatically determine the\n   IPv4-signaled LSP to use for\
    \ a particular IPv6 destination by looking\n   at the MP-BGP routing information.\n\
    \   The IPv4-signaled LSPs can be established using any existing\n   technique\
    \ for label setup [RFC3031] (LDP, RSVP-TE, etc.).\n   To ensure interoperability\
    \ among systems that implement the 6PE\n   approach described in this document,\
    \ all such systems MUST support\n   tunneling using IPv4-signaled MPLS LSPs established\
    \ by LDP [RFC3036].\n   When tunneling IPv6 packets over the IPv4 MPLS backbone,\
    \ rather than\n   successively prepend an IPv4 header and then perform label imposition\n\
    \   based on the IPv4 header, the ingress 6PE Router MUST directly\n   perform\
    \ label imposition of the IPv6 header without prepending any\n   IPv4 header.\
    \  The (outer) label imposed MUST correspond to the IPv4-\n   signaled LSP starting\
    \ on the ingress 6PE Router and ending on the\n   egress 6PE Router.\n   While\
    \ this approach could theoretically operate in some situations\n   using a single\
    \ level of labels, there are significant advantages in\n   using a second level\
    \ of labels that are bound to IPv6 prefixes via\n   MP-BGP advertisements in accordance\
    \ with [RFC3107].\n   For instance, the use of a second level label allows Penultimate\
    \ Hop\n   Popping (PHP) on the IPv4 Label Switch Router (LSR) upstream of the\n\
    \   egress 6PE router, without any IPv6 capabilities/upgrades on the\n   penultimate\
    \ router; this is because it still transmits MPLS packets\n   even after the PHP\
    \ (instead of having to transmit IPv6 packets and\n   encapsulate them appropriately).\n\
    \   Also, an existing IPv4-signaled LSP that is using \"IPv4 Explicit NULL\n \
    \  label\" over the last hop (e.g., because that LSP is already being\n   used\
    \ to transport IPv4 traffic with the Pipe Diff-Serv Tunneling\n   Model as defined\
    \ in [RFC3270]) could not be used to carry IPv6 with a\n   single label since\
    \ the \"IPv4 Explicit NULL label\" cannot be used to\n   carry native IPv6 traffic\
    \ (see [RFC3032]), while it could be used to\n   carry labeled IPv6 traffic (see\
    \ [RFC4182]).\n   This is why a second label MUST be used with the 6PE approach.\n\
    \   The label bound by MP-BGP to the IPv6 prefix indicates to the egress\n   6PE\
    \ Router that the packet is an IPv6 packet.  This label advertised\n   by the\
    \ egress 6PE Router with MP-BGP MAY be an arbitrary label value,\n   which identifies\
    \ an IPv6 routing context or outgoing interface to\n   send the packet to, or\
    \ MAY be the IPv6 Explicit Null Label.  An\n   ingress 6PE Router MUST be able\
    \ to accept any such advertised label.\n   [RFC2460] requires that every link\
    \ in the IPv6 Internet have an MTU\n   of 1280 octets or larger.  Therefore, on\
    \ MPLS links that are used for\n   transport of IPv6, as per the 6PE approach,\
    \ and that do not support\n   link-specific fragmentation and reassembly, the\
    \ MTU must be\n   configured to at least 1280 octets plus the encapsulation overhead.\n\
    \   Some IPv6 hosts might be sending packets larger than the MTU\n   available\
    \ in the IPv4 MPLS core and rely on Path MTU discovery to\n   learn about those\
    \ links.  To simplify MTU discovery operations, one\n   option is for the network\
    \ administrator to engineer the MTU on the\n   core facing interfaces of the ingress\
    \ 6PE consistent with the core\n   MTU.  ICMP 'Packet Too Big' messages can then\
    \ be sent back by the\n   ingress 6PE without the corresponding packets ever entering\
    \ the MPLS\n   core.  Otherwise, routers in the IPv4 MPLS network have the option\
    \ to\n   generate an ICMP \"Packet Too Big\" message using mechanisms as\n   described\
    \ in Section 2.3.2, \"Tunneling Private Addresses through a\n   Public Backbone\"\
    \ of [RFC3032].\n   Note that in the above case, should a core router with an\
    \ outgoing\n   link with an MTU smaller than 1280 receive an encapsulated IPv6\n\
    \   packet larger than 1280, then the mechanisms of [RFC3032] may result\n   in\
    \ the \"Packet Too Big\" message never reaching the sender.  This is\n   because,\
    \ according to [RFC4443], the core router will build an ICMP\n   \"Packet Too\
    \ Big\" message filled with the invoking packet up to 1280\n   bytes, and when\
    \ forwarding downstream towards the egress PE as per\n   [RFC3032], the MTU of\
    \ the outgoing link will cause the packet to be\n   dropped.  This may cause significant\
    \ operational problems; the\n   originator of the packets will notice that his\
    \ data is not getting\n   through, without knowing why and where they are discarded.\
    \  This\n   issue would only occur if the above recommendation (to configure MTU\n\
    \   on MPLS links of at least 1280 octets plus encapsulation overhead) is\n  \
    \ not adhered to (perhaps by misconfiguration).\n"
- title: 4.  Crossing Multiple IPv4 Autonomous Systems
  contents:
  - "4.  Crossing Multiple IPv4 Autonomous Systems\n   This section discusses the\
    \ case where two IPv6 islands are connected\n   to different Autonomous Systems\
    \ (ASes).\n   Like in the case of multi-AS backbone operations for IPv4 VPNs\n\
    \   described in Section 10 of [RFC4364], three main approaches can be\n   distinguished:\n\
    \   a. eBGP redistribution of IPv6 routes from AS to neighboring AS\n      This\
    \ approach is the equivalent for exchange of IPv6 routes to\n      procedure (a)\
    \ described in Section 10 of [RFC4364] for the\n      exchange of VPN-IPv4 routes.\n\
    \      In this approach, the 6PE routers use IBGP (according to [RFC2545]\n  \
    \    and [RFC3107] and as described in this document for the single-AS\n     \
    \ situation) to redistribute labeled IPv6 routes either to an\n      Autonomous\
    \ System Border Router (ASBR) 6PE router, or to a route\n      reflector of which\
    \ an ASBR 6PE router is a client.  The ASBR then\n      uses eBGP to redistribute\
    \ the (non-labeled) IPv6 routes to an ASBR\n      in another AS, which in turn\
    \ distributes them to the 6PE routers\n      in that AS as described earlier in\
    \ this specification, or perhaps\n      to another ASBR, which in turn distributes\
    \ them etc.\n      There may be one, or multiple, ASBR interconnection(s) across\
    \ any\n      two ASes.  IPv6 needs to be activated on the inter-ASBR links and\n\
    \      each ASBR 6PE router has at least one IPv6 address on the\n      interface\
    \ to that link.\n      No inter-AS LSPs are used.  There is effectively a separate\
    \ mesh\n      of LSPs across the 6PE routers within each AS.\n      In this approach,\
    \ the ASBR exchanging IPv6 routes may peer over\n      IPv6 or IPv4.  The exchange\
    \ of IPv6 routes MUST be carried out as\n      per [RFC2545].\n      Note that\
    \ the peering ASBR in the neighboring AS to which the IPv6\n      routes were\
    \ distributed with eBGP, should in its turn redistribute\n      these routes to\
    \ the 6PEs in its AS using IBGP and encoding its own\n      IPv4 address as the\
    \ IPv4-mapped IPv6 BGP Next Hop.\n   b. eBGP redistribution of labeled IPv6 routes\
    \ from AS to neighboring\n      AS\n      This approach is the equivalent for\
    \ exchange of IPv6 routes to\n      procedure (b) described in Section 10 of [RFC4364]\
    \ for the\n      exchange of VPN-IPv4 routes.\n      In this approach, the 6PE\
    \ routers use IBGP (as described earlier\n      in this document for the single-AS\
    \ situation) to redistribute\n      labeled IPv6 routes either to an Autonomous\
    \ System Border Router\n      (ASBR) 6PE router, or to a route reflector of which\
    \ an ASBR 6PE\n      router is a client.  The ASBR then uses eBGP to redistribute\
    \ the\n      labeled IPv6 routes to an ASBR in another AS, which in turn\n   \
    \   distributes them to the 6PE routers in that AS as described\n      earlier\
    \ in this specification, or perhaps to another ASBR, which\n      in turn distributes\
    \ them, etc.\n      There may be one, or multiple, ASBR interconnection(s) across\
    \ any\n      two ASes.  IPv6 may or may not be activated on the inter-ASBR\n \
    \     links.\n      This approach requires that there be label switched paths\n\
    \      established across ASes.  Hence the corresponding considerations\n    \
    \  described for procedure (b) in Section 10 of [RFC4364] apply\n      equally\
    \ to this approach for IPv6.\n      In this approach, the ASBR exchanging IPv6\
    \ routes may peer over\n      IPv4 or IPv6 (in which case IPv6 obviously needs\
    \ to be activated\n      on the inter-ASBR link).  When peering over IPv6, the\
    \ exchange of\n      labeled IPv6 routes MUST be carried out as per [RFC2545]\
    \ and\n      [RFC3107].  When peering over IPv4, the exchange of labeled IPv6\n\
    \      routes MUST be carried out as per [RFC2545] and [RFC3107] with\n      encoding\
    \ of the IPv4 address of the ASBR as an IPv4-mapped IPv6\n      address in the\
    \ BGP Next Hop field.\n   c. Multi-hop eBGP redistribution of labeled IPv6 routes\
    \ between\n      source and destination ASes, with eBGP redistribution of labeled\n\
    \      IPv4 routes from AS to neighboring AS.\n      This approach is the equivalent\
    \ for exchange of IPv6 routes to\n      procedure (c) described in Section 10\
    \ of [RFC4364] for exchange of\n      VPN-IPv4 routes.\n      In this approach,\
    \ IPv6 routes are neither maintained nor\n      distributed by the ASBR routers.\
    \  The ASBR routers need not be\n      dual stack, but may be IPv4/MPLS-only routers.\
    \  An ASBR needs to\n      maintain labeled IPv4 /32 routes to the 6PE routers\
    \ within its AS.\n      It uses eBGP to distribute these routes to other ASes.\
    \  ASBRs in\n      any transit ASes will also have to use eBGP to pass along the\n\
    \      labeled IPv4 /32 routes.  This results in the creation of an IPv4\n   \
    \   label switched path from the ingress 6PE router to the egress 6PE\n      router.\
    \  Now 6PE routers in different ASes can establish multi-hop\n      eBGP connections\
    \ to each other over IPv4, and can exchange labeled\n      IPv6 routes (with an\
    \ IPv4-mapped IPv6 BGP Next Hop) over those\n      connections.\n      IPv6 need\
    \ not be activated on the inter-ASBR links.\n      The considerations described\
    \ for procedure (c) in Section 10 of\n      [RFC4364] with respect to possible\
    \ use of multi-hop eBGP\n      connections via route-reflectors in different ASes,\
    \ as well as\n      with respect to the use of a third label in case the IPv4\
    \ /32\n      routes for the PE routers are NOT made known to the P routers,\n\
    \      apply equally to this approach for IPv6.\n      This approach requires\
    \ that there be IPv4 label switched paths\n      established across the ASes leading\
    \ from a packet's ingress 6PE\n      router to its egress 6PE router.  Hence the\
    \ considerations\n      described for procedure (c) in Section 10 of [RFC4364],\
    \ with\n      respect to LSPs spanning multiple ASes, apply equally to this\n\
    \      approach for IPv6.\n      Note also that the exchange of IPv6 routes can\
    \ only start after\n      BGP has created IPv4 connectivity between the ASes.\n"

  - "5.  Security Considerations\n   The extensions defined in this document allow\
    \ BGP to propagate\n   reachability information about IPv6 routes over an MPLS\
    \ IPv4 core\n   network.  As such, no new security issues are raised beyond those\n\
    \   that already exist in BGP-4 and use of MP-BGP for IPv6.\n   The security features\
    \ of BGP and corresponding security policy\n   defined in the ISP domain are applicable.\n\
    \   For the inter-AS distribution of IPv6 routes according to case (a) of\n  \
    \ Section 4 of this document, no new security issues are raised beyond\n   those\
    \ that already exist in the use of eBGP for IPv6 [RFC2545].\n   For the inter-AS\
    \ distribution of IPv6 routes according to case (b)\n   and (c) of Section 4 of\
    \ this document, the procedures require that\n   there be label switched paths\
    \ established across the AS boundaries.\n   Hence the appropriate trust relationships\
    \ must exist between and\n   among the set of ASes along the path.  Care must\
    \ be taken to avoid\n   \"label spoofing\".  To this end an ASBR 6PE SHOULD only\
    \ accept labeled\n   packets from its peer ASBR 6PE if the topmost label is a\
    \ label that\n   it has explicitly signaled to that peer ASBR 6PE.\n   Note that\
    \ for the inter-AS distribution of IPv6 routes, according to\n   case (c) of Section\
    \ 4 of this document, label spoofing may be more\n   difficult to prevent.  Indeed,\
    \ the MPLS label distributed with the\n   IPv6 routes via multi-hop eBGP is directly\
    \ sent from the egress 6PE\n   to ingress 6PEs in another AS (or through route\
    \ reflectors).  This\n   label is advertised transparently through the AS boundaries.\
    \  When\n   the egress 6PE that sent the labeled IPv6 routes receives a data\n\
    \   packet that has this particular label on top of its stack, it may not\n  \
    \ be able to verify whether the label was pushed on the stack by an\n   ingress\
    \ 6PE that is allowed to do so.  As such, one AS may be\n   vulnerable to label\
    \ spoofing in a different AS.  The same issue\n   equally applies to the option\
    \ (c) of Section 10 of [RFC4364].  Just\n   as it is the case for [RFC4364], addressing\
    \ this particular security\n   issue is for further study.\n"
