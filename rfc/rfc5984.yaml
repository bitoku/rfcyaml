  - "1.  Introduction\n   Mechanisms for efficient packet forwarding has evolved over\
    \ the past\n   years.  The demand for bandwidth is always increasing.  Instead\
    \ of\n   optimizing forwarding performance and link capacity in an incremental\n\
    \   fashion, we propose a brand new concept in packet forwarding that\n   will\
    \ provide unsurpassed end user performance regardless of link\n   capacity, distance,\
    \ and number of hops.\n"
- title: 1.1.  Requirements Language
  contents:
  - "1.1.  Requirements Language\n   The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\"\
    , \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"\
    MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n   document are to be interpreted as described\
    \ in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].\n"
- title: 2.  Background
  contents:
  - "2.  Background\n   During the past years, there have been a lot of improvements\
    \ made in\n   the domain of packet forwarding.  Both software and hardware\n \
    \  optimizations combined with increased link capacities have cut down\n   round-trip\
    \ times.  Despite these improvements, many users find\n   themselves frustrated\
    \ since their demand for bandwidth has increased\n   faster than the supply.\n\
    \   The current incremental approach to lower latency and increase\n   capacity\
    \ will soon reach the end of the road.  The reason for this\n   has been known\
    \ for some time and is stated in RFC 1925 [RFC1925]\n   clause 2:\n   \"(2) No\
    \ matter how hard you push and no matter what the priority, you\n   can't increase\
    \ the speed of light.\"\n   Our research has finally been able to circumvent this\
    \ boundary by the\n   development of zero-latency network paths.\n   Inspired\
    \ by RFC 1072 [RFC1072], where a network containing a long,\n   fat pipe is called\
    \ LFN (pronounced \"elephan(t)\"), we will refer to an\n   internet path with\
    \ zero-latency as \"infinitely fat\", and a network\n   containing this path as\
    \ \"IFN\" (pronounced \"infan(t)\").\n   Before the invention of this new forwarding\
    \ principle, several\n   experimental methods were tried.  We have chosen to share\
    \ our failed\n   attempts in order help others avoid the same mistakes that we\n\
    \   encountered.  The following two methods have been dismissed:\n   o  Black\
    \ Fiber\n   o  Schrodinger's cat experiment\n"
- title: 2.1.  Experiments with Black Fiber
  contents:
  - "2.1.  Experiments with Black Fiber\n   Attempting to push the speed-of-light\
    \ limitation by means of using\n   black fiber looked promising at first.  Shortly\
    \ after initiating the\n   experiment, lack of light was detected in the black\
    \ fiber.  This was\n   interpreted as proof of successful data transmission faster\
    \ than the\n   speed of light.  After popping the champagne, the following problems\n\
    \   were detected:\n   1.  No data reached the receiver.\n   2.  The fiber was\
    \ not connected at the transmitting side.\n   This clearly spoiled the mood of\
    \ the party.\n"
- title: 2.2.  Schrodinger's Cat Experiment
  contents:
  - "2.2.  Schrodinger's Cat Experiment\n   The Schrodinger's netcat experiment was\
    \ based on an attempt to\n   implement the method described by E. Schrodinger\
    \ [Schrodinger35].\n   The original procedure includes locking up cats in boxes\
    \ with\n   radioactive materials and poisonous gas.  Data communication\n   capabilities\
    \ were added to the experiment, by using netcat.  The\n   research team was dumbfounded\
    \ by the notion that the cat experiment\n   seemed to work and not work at the\
    \ same time.  This was also\n   confirmed by a friend of Wigner's [Wigner].\n\
    \   A detailed analysis of the experiment indicated that the probability\n   vectors\
    \ collapsed whenever traffic was sent to the box.  The\n   conclusion was that\
    \ this approach would only work without traffic,\n   thus eliminating all practical\
    \ applications.\n"
- title: 3.  ESP-Based Forwarding
  contents:
  - "3.  ESP-Based Forwarding\n   Experiments with ESP-based (Extra Sensory Perception)\
    \ forwarding has\n   proved to successfully remove the limitation in RFC 1925\
    \ [RFC1925].\n   The foundation for the ESP-based forwarding scheme is to reduce\n\
    \   latency by means of precognitive datagram detection and generation.\n   By\
    \ applying this technology, latency will not only reach zero, but\n   might even\
    \ become negative.\n   Experiments performed by Benjamin Libet [Libet85] regarding\
    \ the\n   readiness potential (Bereitschaftspotential) concludes that the end\n\
    \   user latency from impulse to the conscious mind is approximately 350\n   -\
    \ 400 ms.  In order to reach the highest possible data transport\n   without confusing\
    \ the end user, it is important to take this latency\n   into consideration.\n"
- title: 3.1.  Principle of Operation
  contents:
  - "3.1.  Principle of Operation\n   Traffic between the end user and the server\
    \ reaches the ESP-enabled\n   router.  Inside the ESP-based router, the data stream\
    \ is first\n   analyzed by the DPAUI (Deep Packet And User Inspection).  The DPAUI\n\
    \   sends a signal to the PPG (Deep Packet And User Inspection), which\n   generates\
    \ uplink IP datagrams supported by the IID (Infinite\n   Improbability Drive).\
    \  The generated IP datagram is sent to the CFE\n   (Clairvoyant Forwarding Engine)\
    \ that forwards the datagram.  Finally,\n   the \"real\" uplink, the end user\
    \ datagram is received and forwarded to\n   the ND (Null Device).\n"
- title: 3.2.  Architectural Components
  contents:
  - "3.2.  Architectural Components\n   The current ESP-based forwarding architecture\
    \ includes the following\n   components:\n   o  DPAUI\n   o  PPG\n   o  IID\n\
    \   o  CFE\n   o  PPS\n   o  ND\n"
- title: 3.2.1.  DPAUI
  contents:
  - "3.2.1.  DPAUI\n   The DPAUI (Deep Packet And User Inspection) monitors the data\
    \ streams\n   for all individual users.  The DPAUI is implemented by means of\n\
    \   implementing a learning agent that analyzes each individual user.\n   The\
    \ output from the DPAUI is a signal that indicates that an IP\n   datagram will\
    \ be sent by the end user within a couple of seconds.\n"
- title: 3.2.2.  PPG
  contents:
  - "3.2.2.  PPG\n   The purpose of the PPG (Precognitive Packet Generator) is to\
    \ generate\n   the IP datagram that the end user will trigger to be sent.  In\
    \ order\n   to craft such a datagram, the PPG will perform a lookup based on the\n\
    \   offset and length parameters generated by the IID.  The PPG will\n   generate\
    \ the future packet by means of the function:\n   struct mbuf * CopyDatagramFromPi(\n\
    \                   insane long offset,\n                   unsigned int len);\n\
    \   The CopyDatagramFromPi() function will return a pointer to an mbuf\n   containing\
    \ the IP datagram.  The offset value and len matches a\n   corresponding offset\
    \ and length in the decimal set for pi that\n   contains the bit pattern for the\
    \ future datagram.  This method of\n   operation will reduce the complex matter\
    \ of precognitive packet\n   generation to a simple lookup.\n   Concerns have\
    \ been raised that the full decimal set of pi requires an\n   infinite amount\
    \ of memory.  This might have a negative effect on the\n   manufacturing cost\
    \ of the router.  These concerns were successfully\n   managed by using a perfectly\
    \ circular buffer.  This reduced the\n   previous stated memory requirements at\
    \ least by half.\n"
- title: 3.2.3.  IID
  contents:
  - "3.2.3.  IID\n   The purpose of the IID (Infinite Improbability Drive) is to assist\n\
    \   the PPG and PPS with improbable probabilities (and the other way\n   around).\
    \  The IID was originally invented by Douglas Adams [Adams79].\n   The original\
    \ implementation was based on hooking up the logic\n   circuits of a Bambleweeny\
    \ 57 sub-meson Brain to an atomic vector\n   plotter suspended in a strong Brownian\
    \ motion producer (i.e., a nice\n   hot cup of tea).\n   The research team struggled\
    \ with the implementation of the strong\n   Brownian motion producer.  As a matter\
    \ of fact, the majority of the\n   research budget was wasted before it was fully\
    \ conceived that a warm\n   cup of tea and router equipment rarely mix.\n   Aided\
    \ by the gastronomical department (working on Bistromathic\n   Drive), the research\
    \ team managed to attach a brownie on top of a\n   radio controlled hovercraft\
    \ full of eels.  This not only caused a lot\n   of noise and disarray, but also\
    \ a sufficient amount of Brownian\n   motion.  The research team is still working\
    \ on an entirely software-\n   based solution.  Hopefully, the eel-filled hovercraft\
    \ will soon be\n   replaced with a different type of python script.\n"
- title: 3.2.4.  CFE
  contents:
  - "3.2.4.  CFE\n   After the IP datagram has been produced by the PPG, the CFE\n\
    \   (Clairvoyant Forwarding Engine) will attempt to find the right route.\n  \
    \ Since the route might not exist yet, direct access to a routing table\n   might\
    \ result in routing errors.\n   The implementation of the CFE is very straightforward:\
    \ any off-the-\n   shelf routing stack with a routing table and a routing daemon\
    \ can be\n   used.  A standard Ouija board is simply put on top of the routing\n\
    \   table.  For each datagram, the CFE initiates an Ouija board session\n   that\
    \ will establish a connection with the routing deamons.  The CFE\n   will seek\
    \ guidance for the future of the IP datagram and then send it\n   along for a\
    \ low cost, to meet a tall, dark server rack.\n"
- title: 3.2.5.  PPS
  contents:
  - "3.2.5.  PPS\n   The PPS (Pre-Preemptive Scheduler) is synchronized by means of\
    \ an NTP\n   connection to the IID based NTP server.  This ensures that the ESP\n\
    \   process will execute ten seconds ahead of local time (layman's term:\n   \"\
    into the future\").  This value should ensure operation even with\n   very long\
    \ Round Trip Times and should also include the readiness\n   potential of the\
    \ end user.\n   The pre-preemptive scheduler not only provides a separate user\
    \ space,\n   but a separate dimension for the code to execute in.  The dimension\n\
    \   alignment is based on string theory and has been implemented in the\n   language\
    \ C, simply by including the library string.h and then using\n   strcpy to copy\
    \ the PPS function pointer into an eleven-dimensional\n   array.\n"
- title: 3.2.6.  ND
  contents:
  - "3.2.6.  ND\n   After a little time, less than the 'end user to server' Round-trip\n\
    \   time (RTT), the real end user datagram will reach the ingress side of\n  \
    \ the ESP-based router, since the datagram has already been sent,\n   routed and\
    \ returned.  The datagram is directly routed to the ND (Null\n   Device) and the\
    \ ingress packet counter is decremented.\n   Experimentation showed that the ND\
    \ is a perfect source of entropy and\n   is able to store all digits of pi.  The\
    \ research team had great hopes\n   of reducing the memory footprint for the PPG\
    \ even further, but ran\n   into problems with read access times.\n   The ND is\
    \ readily available in most operating systems.\n"
- title: 4.  End User Considerations
  contents:
  - "4.  End User Considerations\n   End user considerations and differentiated traffic\
    \ classes:\n   1.  In order to facilitate a pleasant end user gaming experience,\n\
    \       packets destined for the spinal cord (i.e., force feedback\n       information,\
    \ etc.) must be delayed by 350 ms in order to\n       synchronize with the traffic\
    \ that is routed by the end user to\n       the cerebrum and cortex.\n   2.  RFC\
    \ 1216 [RFC1216], Section 3.3 states that \"bad news travels\n       fast\". \
    \ This means that additional delay must be introduced when\n       the end user\
    \ is browsing on news sites.  Negative latency might\n       make the end user\
    \ suspect that the news is even worse than\n       indicated by the news sites.\n\
    \   3.  Machine-to-Machine (M2M) communication might experience reduced\n    \
    \   performance due to difficulties for the DPAUI to work correctly.\n       When\
    \ the concept starts working for M2M communication, this can\n       be used as\
    \ an indication that a technological singularity might\n       be near.\n"
- title: 5.  TCP Slow-Start Considerations
  contents:
  - "5.  TCP Slow-Start Considerations\n   The lack of RTT of IFNs might cause some\
    \ problems with TCP slow-\n   start.  More precisely, it will most likely not\
    \ be slow at all.  This\n   might be handled by implementing a congestion avoidance\
    \ mechanism,\n   but will need further study.\n"
