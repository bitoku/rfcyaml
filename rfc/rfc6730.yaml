- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   The IETF Nominations Committee (NomCom) is a body that selects\n\
    \   candidates for open IESG, IAB, and IAOC positions following the\n   process\
    \ outlined in [RFC3777].  There is a need for a set of tools to\n   aid the NomCom\
    \ in efficient operation.  This document presents a set\n   of requirements for\
    \ such a tool.\n"
- title: 1.1.  Conventions Used in This Document
  contents:
  - "1.1.  Conventions Used in This Document\n   The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\"\
    , \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\"\
    , \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n   document are to be interpreted as described\
    \ in [RFC2119].\n"
- title: 2.  Meta Requirement
  contents:
  - "2.  Meta Requirement\n   There is an existing tool for supporting NomCom work.\
    \  The set of\n   requirements specified in this document are mainly enhancement\n\
    \   requirements or behavioral changes to the existing tool.  Unless\n   otherwise\
    \ stated, all of the current functions of the existing NomCom\n   tool need to\
    \ be supported in the new tool as well.\n   o  META-001: The tool MUST provide\
    \ all the functionality that is\n      provided by the current NomCom tool, except\
    \ in cases where a\n      requirement specified in this document overrides a current\n\
    \      behavior.  The current NomCom tool can be found at the following\n    \
    \  URLs: https://www.ietf.org/group/nomcom/2012/private/ displays the\n      NomCom\
    \ private parts of the tool (Private NomCom tool) and\n      https://www.ietf.org/group/nomcom/2012/\
    \ displays the community\n      member accessible parts of the tool (Public NomCom\
    \ tool).\n"
- title: 3.  Authentication
  contents:
  - "3.  Authentication\n   All access to NomCom tools needs to be authenticated.\
    \  Users of the\n   tools have different privileges based on their role.  The\
    \ tool needs\n   to support at least three levels of access: community member,\
    \ NomCom\n   member, and NomCom chair.  The levels of access are set up by the\n\
    \   staff of the IETF Secretariat.  It is to be noted that the\n   Secretariat\
    \ staff do not have any access to the tool.  They are\n   responsible for administering\
    \ the server on which the tool runs;\n   hence, they set up the access control\
    \ list for the tool.\n   Community member access is applicable to the Public NomCom\
    \ tool.  The\n   NomCom member access and the NomCom chair access are applicable\
    \ to\n   the Private NomCom tool.  NomCom members can use the interfaces on\n\
    \   the Public NomCom tool in the community member role.  The NomCom\n   chair\
    \ access authentication applies to the private webpage in the\n   same fashion\
    \ as a NomCom member, with the additional ability to\n   update the information\
    \ on both webpages (i.e., what is visible in the\n   various forms, the templates\
    \ for the automatic emails, etc.).\n   o  AUTH-001: The tool MUST allow members\
    \ of the community to log in\n      with their existing datatracker.ietf.org credentials.\n\
    \   o  AUTH-002: The tool MUST allow members of the community to create a\n  \
    \    new login using the datatracker.ietf.org login system.\n   o  AUTH-003: The\
    \ tool MUST allow the secretariat to enter the email\n      address of the NomCom\
    \ chair and to enter a list of email addresses\n      of the NomCom members. \
    \ The logins associated with these email\n      addresses MUST be accorded the\
    \ respective roles.\n"
- title: 4.  Security and Access Control
  contents:
  - "4.  Security and Access Control\n   All communication between the community and\
    \ the NomCom and amongst\n   the members of the NomCom needs to be stored in an\
    \ encrypted form.\n   This information can only be accessed by members of the\
    \ NomCom.\n   o  SEC-001: The security procedures for the tool MUST be structured\n\
    \      so that even system administrators do not have routine or\n      accidental\
    \ visibility to any data accumulated by the tool.  This\n      data includes all\
    \ confidential feedback and discussions.\n   o  SEC-002: The tool MUST allow the\
    \ NomCom chair to input a public\n      key (\"NomCom public key\").  This key\
    \ is generated by the NomCom\n      chair independent of the tool, for example,\
    \ using the procedure\n      described in Appendix A.\n   o  SEC-003: All communication\
    \ sent to the NomCom mailing list MUST be\n      encrypted with the NomCom public\
    \ key before being committed to\n      persistent storage.\n   o  SEC-004: All\
    \ community feedback entered using the NomCom tool MUST\n      be encrypted with\
    \ the NomCom public key before being committed to\n      persistent storage.\n\
    \   o  SEC-005: After logging in, the tool MUST allow the NomCom members\n   \
    \   to input a private key (\"NomCom private key\") that corresponds to\n    \
    \  the NomCom public key.  This key will be used to decrypt the\n      feedback/communications\
    \ that the member is trying to access.  Once\n      entered, this key MUST be\
    \ available for the entire length of the\n      session until the user logs out.\
    \  This private key MUST NOT be\n      stored in plaintext form into persistent\
    \ storage at any point of\n      time.\n   o  SEC-006: The tool MUST provide a\
    \ mechanism for the NomCom Chair to\n      destroy all data collected by the NomCom\
    \ at the end of the\n      NomCom's term.  Since the NomCom's term overlaps with\
    \ that of the\n      next year's NomCom, the tool MUST ensure that data collected\
    \ by\n      the next year's NomCom is not affected by this deletion.\n"
- title: 5.  Nominations
  contents:
  - "5.  Nominations\n   After the NomCom is constituted, the NomCom chair issues\
    \ a call for\n   nominations for the open positions.  There are two broad ways\
    \ in\n   which nominees are introduced into the system.  The predominant way\n\
    \   is that nominations are entered into the system directly by members\n   of\
    \ the community.  The secondary way is that the nominees are entered\n   in by\
    \ members of the NomCom.  The main difference is that members of\n   the NomCom\
    \ can enter nominations that are originated by other\n   community members.  In\
    \ both of the cases, an email address for the\n   nominee needs to be entered\
    \ into the tool.  Please note that NomCom\n   members usually use the Public NomCom\
    \ tool, not the Private NomCom\n   tool, to enter their personal nominations and\
    \ comments.\n   o  NOM-001: The tool MUST allow members of the community to enter\n\
    \      nominations into the Public NomCom tool.\n   o  NOM-002: The tool MUST\
    \ allow members of the NomCom to enter\n      nominations into the Private NomCom\
    \ tool.  The tool MUST allow the\n      NomCom member to optionally enter information\
    \ about the originator\n      of the nomination.  The tool MUST record the identity\
    \ of the\n      originator (if known) of the nomination for audit purposes.  Note\n\
    \      that anonymous nominations are allowed; thus, the actual identity\n   \
    \   of an originator may not always be entered into the tool.\n   o  NOM-003:\
    \ The tool MUST allow the NomCom chair to specify\n      information that is required\
    \ for the nominations.  This\n      information will be entered by the NomCom\
    \ chair as freeform text\n      and will be presented to the individual performing\
    \ the nomination.\n   o  NOM-004: The tool MUST email the nominee after the nomination\
    \ and\n      mention the position(s) that they have been nominated for.  This\n\
    \      email MUST NOT disclose to the nominee the identity of the person\n   \
    \   who performed the nomination.\n   o  NOM-005: The tool MUST allow the content\
    \ of this email to be\n      customized by the NomCom chair.\n   o  NOM-006: The\
    \ tool MUST automatically attach the questionnaires for\n      the positions for\
    \ which the nominee has been nominated to this\n      email.\n   o  NOM-007: The\
    \ tool MUST be able to identify duplicate nominations\n      of the same person\
    \ with the same email address and consolidate\n      them to point to the same\
    \ nominee.\n   o  NOM-008: In case the same person has been nominated multiple\
    \ times\n      using different email addresses, the tool MUST allow the NomCom\n\
    \      chair to mark duplicate nominations of the same person and\n      consolidate\
    \ them to point to the same nominee.\n   o  NOM-009: The tool MUST allow a communication\
    \ email address for a\n      nominee to be set to one different than the email\
    \ address with\n      which they were nominated.\n   o  NOM-010: The tool MUST\
    \ be able to use the datatracker address book\n      system as the basis for requirements\
    \ NOM-007, NOM-008, and NOM-009\n      but MUST allow the NomCom chair to perform\
    \ manual overrides.\n   o  NOM-011: The tool MUST keep track of the accept and\
    \ decline status\n      for the nominees.\n"
- title: 6.  Accepting and Declining Nominations
  contents:
  - "6.  Accepting and Declining Nominations\n   After receiving the nomination mail,\
    \ nominees usually respond to\n   indicate either that they accept the nomination\
    \ or that they are\n   unwilling to do so.\n   o  AD-001: The tool MUST allow\
    \ nominees to indicate whether they are\n      accepting or declining their nomination.\
    \  This is preferably done\n      by providing distinct hyperlinks in the email\
    \ that the nominees\n      receive.\n   o  AD-002: The tool MUST allow the NomCom\
    \ chair to select specific\n      email responses from the nominees and flag them\
    \ as having been\n      accepted or declined.\n   o  AD-003: The tool MUST allow\
    \ the NomCom chair to manually flag\n      nominees as having accepted or declined\
    \ the nomination without the\n      need for any nominee action.\n   o  AD-004:\
    \ The tool MUST allow NomCom members to view the list of all\n      nominees along\
    \ with their accept or decline status.\n   o  AD-005: The tool MUST allow NomCom\
    \ members to view reports of the\n      accept or decline status both per nominee\
    \ as well as per open\n      position.\n   o  AD-006: The tool MUST be configurable\
    \ to send reminder mails to\n      all nominees who have not responded, either\
    \ on specified dates or\n      at specified intervals.  The contents of the reminder\
    \ mails MUST\n      be customizable by the NomCom chair.\n   o  AD-007: The tool\
    \ MUST be able to generate a summary report\n      containing statistics (total/accept/decline/no\
    \ response)\n      concerning nominations by position.\n"
- title: 7.  Questionnaires
  contents:
  - "7.  Questionnaires\n   Nominees fill in a questionnaire for each position for\
    \ which they\n   accept a nomination.  The completed questionnaire is sent in\
    \ by email\n   to the NomCom mailing list.  If a person has been nominated for\n\
    \   multiple positions, they may elect to send in a combined\n   questionnaire\
    \ for a subset (or all) of the positions (QR-002) or fill\n   in one questionnaire\
    \ per open position (QR-006).\n   o  QR-001: The tool MUST allow the NomCom chair\
    \ to enter a different\n      questionnaire for each open position.\n   o  QR-002:\
    \ The tool MUST allow the NomCom chair to point to email\n      responses from\
    \ the nominees and flag them as questionnaires.\n   o  QR-003: The tool MUST allow\
    \ NomCom members to directly access\n      questionnaires completed by nominees.\n\
    \   o  QR-004: The tool MUST keep track of the questionnaire receipt\n      status\
    \ for the nominees.  The completed questionnaires are\n      received as emails\
    \ to the NomCom mailing list.\n   o  QR-005: Like all other correspondence on\
    \ the NomCom mailing list,\n      the completed questionnaires MUST be encrypted\
    \ by the NomCom\n      public key before being stored.\n   o  QR-006: The NomCom\
    \ chair MUST be able to flag an email as the\n      completed questionnaire for\
    \ a nominee corresponding to a specific\n      open position.\n   o  QR-007: Once\
    \ flagged, the questionnaire provided by the nominee\n      for a specific position\
    \ MUST be directly accessible without\n      needing to look through all other\
    \ feedback received for that\n      nominee.\n"
- title: 8.  Feedback Collection
  contents:
  - "8.  Feedback Collection\n   Community feedback is very important in the NomCom\
    \ process.\n   Community feedback about nominees is the primary mechanism by which\n\
    \   NomCom members evaluate nominees.\n   o  FB-001: The tool MUST allow members\
    \ of the community to enter\n      feedback about any of the accepting nominees\
    \ into the Public\n      NomCom tool.\n   o  FB-002: The tool MUST allow members\
    \ of the NomCom to enter\n      feedback about any of the accepting nominees into\
    \ the Private\n      NomCom tool.  The tool MUST allow the NomCom member to optionally\n\
    \      enter information about the originator of the feedback.  Note\n      that,\
    \ as in NOM-002, anonymous feedback is allowed; thus, the\n      actual identity\
    \ of an originator may not always be entered into\n      the tool.\n   o  FB-003:\
    \ The tool MUST allow NomCom members to view feedback\n      entered for each\
    \ nominee.  The identity of the submitter should\n      also be visible with the\
    \ feedback, unless the submitter wishes to\n      be anonymous.\n   o  FB-004:\
    \ The NomCom members MUST be able to enter their interview\n      comments as\
    \ feedback for the nominee being interviewed.\n   o  FB-005: All email received\
    \ on the NomCom mailing list MUST be\n      archived.  This includes all correspondence\
    \ among the NomCom\n      members, feedback received over email, as well as completed\n\
    \      questionnaires.\n   o  FB-006: The tool MUST allow the NomCom chair to\
    \ manually copy any\n      of the archived mails into the feedback section of\
    \ one or more\n      nominees for one or more open positions.  This is required\
    \ because\n      a single email may contain feedback concerning more than one\n\
    \      nominee or more than one open position.\n"
- title: 9.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "9.  Security Considerations\n   The tool must authenticate all users and must\
    \ allow logins to be\n   classified into three roles: NomCom chair, NomCom member,\
    \ and\n   community member.  All communications to/from the NomCom and among\n\
    \   members of the NomCom must be stored in an encrypted form.\n"
