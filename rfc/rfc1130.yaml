    \ This memo describes the state of standardization of protocols used in\n   the\
    \ Internet as determined by the Internet Activities Board (IAB).\n   Distribution\
    \ of this memo is unlimited.\nIntroduction\n   An overview of the standards procedures\
    \ is presented first, followed\n   by discussions of the standardization process\
    \ and the RFC document\n   series, then the explanation of the terms is presented,\
    \ the lists of\n   protocols in each stage of standardization follows, and finally\n\
    \   pointers to references and contacts for further information.\n   This memo\
    \ is issued quarterly, please be sure the copy you are\n   reading is dated within\
    \ the last three months.  Current copies may be\n   obtained from the Network\
    \ Information Center or from the Internet\n   Assigned Numbers Authority (see\
    \ the contact information at the end of\n   this memo).  Do not use this memo\
    \ after 31-Jan-90.\n   See Section 6.1 for a description of recent changes.\n\
    1.  Overview of Standards Procedures\n   The Internet Activities Board maintains\
    \ a list of documents that\n   define standards for the Internet protocol suite\
    \ (see RFC-1120 for an\n   explanation of the role and organization of the IAB).\
    \  The IAB\n   provides these standards with the goal of co-ordinating the evolution\n\
    \   of the Internet protocols; this co-ordination has become quite\n   important\
    \ as the Internet protocols are increasingly in general\n   commercial use.\n\
    \   Protocol standards may be suggested by anyone in the Internet\n   community,\
    \ by writing and submitting an RFC.  In general, any\n   suggested protocol will\
    \ be reviewed or developed in the context of\n   some Task Force of the IAB, or\
    \ some research group or working group\n   within that Task Force.  The IAB will\
    \ assign a suggested protocol to\n   a working group or research group if official\
    \ delegation is\n   necessary.\n   Given the important role of the Internet Engineering\
    \ Task Force in\n   the evolution of the Internet Architecture, all proposed protocols\n\
    \   will be reviewed by the Internet Engineering Steering Group (IESG)\n   which\
    \ is composed of the Technical Area Directors.\n   The recommendation of the IESG\
    \ and working group or research group is\n   given major consideration in the\
    \ decision by the IAB to assign a\n   state and status to the protocol.  The general\
    \ policy is to gain\n   implementation experience with a protocol before considering\
    \ a\n   possible designation as an official standard.\n   In cases where there\
    \ is uncertainty as to the proper decision\n   concerning a protocol, the IAB\
    \ may convene a special review committee\n   consisting of interested parties\
    \ from the working group and members\n   of the IAB itself, with the purpose of\
    \ recommending some explicit\n   action to the IAB.\n   A few protocols have achieved\
    \ widespread implementation without the\n   approval of the IAB.  For example,\
    \ some vendor protocols have become\n   very important to the Internet community\
    \ even though they have not\n   been proposed or reviewed by the IAB.  However,\
    \ the IAB strongly\n   recommends that the IAB standards process be used in the\
    \ evolution of\n   the protocol suite to maximize interoperability (and to prevent\n\
    \   incompatible protocol requirements from arising).  The IAB reserves\n   the\
    \ use of the term \"standard\" in any RFC to only those protocols\n   which the\
    \ IAB has approved.\n2.  The Standardization Process\n   Anyone can invent a protocol,\
    \ document it, implement it, test it, and\n   so on.  The IAB believes that it\
    \ is very useful to document a\n   protocol at an early stage to promote suggestions\
    \ from others\n   interested in the functionality the of protocol and from those\n\
    \   interested in protocol design.  Once a protocol is implemented and\n   tested\
    \ it is useful to report the results.  The RFC document series\n   is the preferred\
    \ place for publishing these protocol documents and\n   testing results.\n   The\
    \ IAB encourages the documenting of every protocol developed in the\n   Internet\
    \ (that is, the publication of the protocol specification as\n   an RFC), even\
    \ if it is never intended that the protocol become an\n   Internet standard. \
    \ A protocol that is not intended to become a\n   standard is called \"experimental\"\
    .\n   Protocols that are intended to become standards are first designated\n \
    \  as \"proposed\" protocols.  It is expected that while in this state the\n \
    \  protocol will be implemented and tested by several groups.  It is\n   likely\
    \ that an improved version of the protocol will result from this\n   activity.\n\
    \   Once a proposed protocol has become stable and has a sponsor (an\n   individual\
    \ willing to speak for the protocol to the IAB) it may\n   advance to the \"draft\
    \ standard\" state.  In this state, it should be\n   reviewed by the entire Internet\
    \ community.  This draft standard state\n   is essentially a warning to the community\
    \ that unless an objection is\n   raised or a flaw is found this protocol will\
    \ become a \"standard\".\n   Once a protocol has been a draft standard for a sufficient\
    \ time\n   (usually 6 months) without serious objections the IAB may act to\n\
    \   declare the protocol an official Internet standard.\n   Some protocols have\
    \ been superseded by better protocols or are\n   otherwise unused.  Such protocols\
    \ are designated \"historic\".\n   In addition to a state (like proposed or standard)\
    \ a protocol is also\n   assigned a status.  A protocol can be required, meaning\
    \ that all\n   systems in the Internet must implement it.  For example, the Internet\n\
    \   Protocol (IP) is required.  A protocol may be recommended, meaning\n   that\
    \ systems should implement this protocol.  A protocol may be\n   elective, meaning\
    \ that systems may implement this protocol; that is,\n   if (and only if) the\
    \ functionality of this protocol is needed or\n   useful for a system it must\
    \ use this protocol to provide the\n   functionality.  A protocol may be termed\
    \ not recommended if it is not\n   intended to be generally implemented; for example,\
    \ experimental or\n   historic protocols.\n   Few protocols are required to be\
    \ implemented in all systems.  This is\n   because there is such a variety of\
    \ possible systems; for example,\n   gateways, terminal servers, workstations,\
    \ multi-user hosts.  It is\n   not necessary for a gateway to implement TCP and\
    \ the protocols that\n   use TCP (though it may be useful).  It is expected that\
    \ general\n   purpose hosts will implement at least IP (including ICMP), TCP and\n\
    \   UDP, Telnet, FTP, SMTP, Mail, and the Domain Name System (DNS).\n3.  The Request\
    \ for Comments Documents\n   The documents called Request for Comments (or RFCs)\
    \ are the working\n   notes of the Internet research and development community.\
    \  A document\n   in this series may be on essentially any topic related to computer\n\
    \   communication, and may be anything from a meeting report to the\n   specification\
    \ of a standard.\n   Notice:\n      All standards are published as RFCs, but not\
    \ all RFCs specify\n      standards.\n   Anyone can submit a document for publication\
    \ as an RFC.  Submissions\n   must be made via electronic mail to the RFC Editor\
    \ (see the contact\n   information at the end of this memo).\n   While RFCs are\
    \ not refereed publications, they do receive technical\n   review from the task\
    \ forces, individual technical experts, or the RFC\n   Editor, as appropriate.\n\
    \   Once a document is assigned an RFC number and published, that RFC is\n   never\
    \ revised or re-issued with the same number.  There is never a\n   question of\
    \ having the most recent version of a particular RFC.\n   However, a protocol\
    \ (such as File Transfer Protocol (FTP)) may be\n   improved and re-documented\
    \ many times in several different RFCs.  It\n   is important to verify that you\
    \ have the most recent RFC on a\n   particular protocol.  This \"IAB Official\
    \ Protocol Standards\" memo is\n   the reference for determining the correct RFC\
    \ to refer to for the\n   current specification of each protocol.\n   The RFCs\
    \ are available from the Network Information Center at SRI\n   International.\
    \  For more information about obtaining RFCs see the\n   contact information at\
    \ the end of this memo.\n4.  Other Reference Documents\n   There are four other\
    \ reference documents of interest in checking the\n   current status of protocol\
    \ specifications and standardization.  These\n   are the Assigned Numbers, the\
    \ Official Protocols, the Gateway\n   Requirements, and the Host Requirements.\
    \  Note that these documents\n   are revised and updated at different times; in\
    \ case of differences\n   between these documents, the most recent must prevail.\n\
    \   Also one should be aware of the MIL-STD publications on IP, TCP,\n   Telnet,\
    \ FTP, and SMTP.  These are described in section 4.5.\n4.1.  Assigned Numbers\n\
    \   This document lists the assigned values of the parameters used in the\n  \
    \ various protocols.  For example, IP protocol codes, TCP port numbers,\n   Telnet\
    \ Option Codes, ARP hardware types, and Terminal Type names.\n   Assigned Numbers\
    \ was most recently issued as RFC-1010.\n   Another document, Internet Numbers,\
    \ lists the assigned IP network\n   numbers, and the autonomous system numbers.\
    \  Internet Numbers was\n   most recently issued as RFC-1117.\n4.2.  Official\
    \ Protocols\n   This document list the protocols and describes any known problems\
    \ and\n   ongoing experiments.  Official Protocols was most recently issued as\n\
    \   RFC-1011.\n4.3.  Gateway Requirements\n   This document reviews the specifications\
    \ that apply to gateways and\n   supplies guidance and clarification for any ambiguities.\
    \  Gateway\n   Requirements is RFC-1009.\n4.4.  Host Requirements\n   This pair\
    \ of document reviews the specifications that apply to hosts\n   and supplies\
    \ guidance and clarification for any ambiguities.  Host\n   Requirements was recently\
    \ issued as RFC-1122 and RFC-1123.\n4.5.  The MIL-STD Documents\n   The Internet\
    \ community specifications for IP (RFC-791) and TCP (RFC-\n   793) and the DoD\
    \ MIL-STD specifications are intended to describe\n   exactly the same protocols.\
    \  Any difference in the protocols\n   specified by these sets of documents should\
    \ be reported to DCA and to\n   the IAB.  The RFCs and the MIL-STDs for IP and\
    \ TCP differ in style\n   and level of detail.  It is strongly advised that the\
    \ two sets of\n   documents be used together.\n   The IAB and the DoD MIL-STD\
    \ specifications for the FTP, SMTP, and\n   Telnet protocols are essentially the\
    \ same documents (RFCs 765, 821,\n   854).  The MIL-STD versions have been edited\
    \ slightly.  Note that the\n   current Internet specification for FTP is RFC-959.\n\
    \          Internet Protocol (IP)                      MIL-STD-1777\n        \
    \  Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)         MIL-STD-1778\n          File Transfer\
    \ Protocol (FTP)                MIL-STD-1780\n          Simple Mail Transfer Protocol\
    \ (SMTP)        MIL-STD-1781\n          Telnet Protocol and Options (TELNET) \
    \       MIL-STD-1782\n5.  Explanation of Terms\n   There are two independent categorizations\
    \ of protocols.  The first is\n   the state of standardization which is one of\
    \ \"standard\", \"draft\n   standard\", \"proposed\", \"experimental\", or \"\
    historic\".  The second is\n   the status of this protocol which is one of \"\
    required\",\n   \"recommended\", \"elective\", or \"not recommended\".  One could\
    \ expect a\n   particular protocol to move along the scale of status from elective\n\
    \   to required at the same time as it moves along the scale of\n   standardization\
    \ from proposed to standard.\n   At any given time a protocol is a cell of the\
    \ following matrix.\n   Protocols are likely to be in cells in about the following\n\
    \   proportions (indicated by the number of Xs).  Most will be on the\n   main\
    \ diagonal.  A new protocol is most likely to start in the\n   (proposed, elective)\
    \ cell, or the (experimental, not recommended)\n   cell.\n                   \

    \   Some protocol are particular to hosts and some to gateways; a few\n   protocols\
    \ are used in both.  The definitions of the terms below will\n   refer to a \"\
    system\" which is either a host or a gateway (or both).\n   It should be clear\
    \ from the context of the particular protocol which\n   types of systems are intended.\n\
    5.1.  Definitions of Protocol State\n   5.1.1.  Standard Protocol\n      The IAB\
    \ has established this as an official standard protocol for\n      the Internet.\
    \  These are separated into two groups: (1) IP\n      protocol and above, protocols\
    \ that apply to the whole Internet;\n      and (2) network-specific protocols,\
    \ generally specifications of\n      how to do IP on particular types of networks.\n\
    \   5.1.2.  Draft Standard Protocol\n      The IAB is actively considering this\
    \ protocol as a possible\n      Standard Protocol.  Substantial and widespread\
    \ testing and comment\n      is desired.  Comments and test results should be\
    \ submitted to the\n      IAB.  There is a possibility that changes will be made\
    \ in a Draft\n      Standard Protocol before it becomes a Standard Protocol.\n\
    \   5.1.3.  Proposed Protocol\n      These are protocol proposals that may be\
    \ considered by the IAB for\n      standardization in the future.  Implementation\
    \ and testing by\n      several groups is desirable.  Revisions of the protocol\n\
    \      specification are likely.\n   5.1.4.  Experimental Protocol\n      A system\
    \ should not implement an experimental protocol unless it\n      is participating\
    \ in the experiment and has coordinated its use of\n      the protocol with the\
    \ developer of the protocol.\n      Typically, experimental protocols are those\
    \ that are developed as\n      part of a specific ongoing research project not\
    \ related to an\n      operational service offering.  While they may be proposed\
    \ as a\n      service protocol at a later stage, and thus become proposed,\n \
    \     draft, and then standard protocols, the designation of a protocol\n    \
    \  as experimental is meant to suggest that the protocol, although\n      perhaps\
    \ mature, is not intended for operational use.\n   5.1.5.  Historic Protocol\n\
    \      These are protocols that are unlikely to ever become standards in\n   \
    \   the Internet either because they have been superseded by later\n      developments\
    \ or due to lack of interest.  These are protocols that\n      are at an evolutionary\
    \ dead end.\n5.2.  Definitions of Protocol Status\n   5.2.1.  Required Protocol\n\
    \      All systems must implement the required protocols.\n   5.2.2.  Recommended\
    \ Protocol\n      All systems should implement the recommended protocols.\n  \
    \ 5.2.3.  Elective Protocol\n      A system may or may not implement an elective\
    \ protocol. The\n      general notion is that if you are going to do something\
    \ like this,\n      you must do exactly this.\n   5.2.4.  Not Recommended Protocol\n\
    \      These protocols are not recommended for general use.  This may be\n   \
    \   because of their limited functionality, specialized nature, or\n      experimental\
    \ or historic state.\n6.  The Protocols\n   This section list the standards in\
    \ groups by protocol state.\n6.1.  Recent Changes:\n   The Host Requirements [RFC-1122,\
    \ RFC-1123] is now a Required\n   Standard.\n   The Network Time Protocol [RFC-1119]\
    \ is now a Recommended Standard.\n   The Internet Group Multicast Protocol [RFC-1112]\
    \ is now a Recommended\n   Standard.\n   The mail Content Type Header Field [RFC-1049]\
    \ is now a Recommended\n   Standard.\n   The \"Internet Numbers\" list was recently\
    \ issued as RFC-1117.\n   The Telnet Linemode Option [RFC-1116] is now a Elective\
    \ Proposed\n   standard.\n   The mail Privacy procedures [RFC-1113, RFC-1114,\
    \ and RFC-1115] are\n   now Elective Draft Standards.\n   The Border Gateway Protocol\
    \ [RFC-1105] is a Not-Recommended\n   Experimental protocol.\n   A procedure for\
    \ sending IP over FDDI networks [RFC-1103] is now a\n   Specific Standard.\n \
    \  The Trivial File Transfer Protocol [RFC-783] is now a Elective Draft\n   Standard.\n\

    \         783\nThe Internet Activities Board has designated two different network\n\
    management protocols with the same status of \"Draft Standard\" and\n\"Recommended\"\
    .  The two protocols are the Common Management Information\nServices and Protocol\
    \ over TCP/IP (CMOT) [RFC-1095] and the Simple\nNetwork Management Protocol (SNMP)\
    \ [RFC-1098].  The IAB intends each of\nthese two protocols to receive the attention\
    \ of implementers and\nexperimenters.  The IAB seeks reports of experience with\
    \ these two\nprotocols from system builders and users.  By this action, the IAB\n\
    recommends that all IP and TCP implementations be network manageable\n(e.g., implement\
    \ the Internet MIB [RFC-1066], and that implementations\nthat are network manageable\
    \ are expected to adopt and implement at least\none of these two Internet Draft\
    \ Standards.  The motivation for this\nposition is discussed in RFCs 1052 and\
    \ 1109.\n6.5.  Proposed Protocols\nProtocol   Name                           \
