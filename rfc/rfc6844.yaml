  - "1.  Introduction\n   The Certification Authority Authorization (CAA) DNS Resource\
    \ Record\n   allows a DNS domain name holder to specify the Certification\n  \
    \ Authorities (CAs) authorized to issue certificates for that domain.\n   Publication\
    \ of CAA Resource Records allows a public Certification\n   Authority to implement\
    \ additional controls to reduce the risk of\n   unintended certificate mis-issue.\n\
    \   Like the TLSA record defined in DNS-Based Authentication of Named\n   Entities\
    \ (DANE) [RFC6698], CAA records are used as a part of a\n   mechanism for checking\
    \ PKIX certificate data.  The distinction\n   between the two specifications is\
    \ that CAA records specify an\n   authorization control to be performed by a certificate\
    \ issuer before\n   issue of a certificate and TLSA records specify a verification\n\
    \   control to be performed by a relying party after the certificate is\n   issued.\n\
    \   Conformance with a published CAA record is a necessary but not\n   sufficient\
    \ condition for issuance of a certificate.  Before issuing a\n   certificate,\
    \ a PKIX CA is required to validate the request according\n   to the policies\
    \ set out in its Certificate Policy.  In the case of a\n   public CA that validates\
    \ certificate requests as a third party, the\n   certificate will typically be\
    \ issued under a public trust anchor\n   certificate embedded in one or more relevant\
    \ Relying Applications.\n   Criteria for inclusion of embedded trust anchor certificates\
    \ in\n   applications are outside the scope of this document.  Typically, such\n\
    \   criteria require the CA to publish a Certificate Practices Statement\n   (CPS)\
    \ that specifies how the requirements of the Certificate Policy\n   (CP) are achieved.\
    \  It is also common for a CA to engage an\n   independent third-party auditor\
    \ to prepare an annual audit statement\n   of its performance against its CPS.\n\
    \   A set of CAA records describes only current grants of authority to\n   issue\
    \ certificates for the corresponding DNS domain.  Since a\n   certificate is typically\
    \ valid for at least a year, it is possible\n   that a certificate that is not\
    \ conformant with the CAA records\n   currently published was conformant with\
    \ the CAA records published at\n   the time that the certificate was issued. \
    \ Relying Applications MUST\n   NOT use CAA records as part of certificate validation.\n\
    \   CAA records MAY be used by Certificate Evaluators as a possible\n   indicator\
    \ of a security policy violation.  Such use SHOULD take\n   account of the possibility\
    \ that published CAA records changed between\n   the time a certificate was issued\
    \ and the time at which the\n   certificate was observed by the Certificate Evaluator.\n"

- title: 3.  The CAA RR Type
  contents:
  - "3.  The CAA RR Type\n   A CAA RR consists of a flags byte and a tag-value pair\
    \ referred to as\n   a property.  Multiple properties MAY be associated with the\
    \ same\n   domain name by publishing multiple CAA RRs at that domain name.  The\n\
    \   following flag is defined:\n   Issuer Critical:  If set to '1', indicates\
    \ that the corresponding\n      property tag MUST be understood if the semantics\
    \ of the CAA record\n      are to be correctly interpreted by an issuer.\n   \
    \   Issuers MUST NOT issue certificates for a domain if the relevant\n      CAA\
    \ Resource Record set contains unknown property tags that have\n      the Critical\
    \ bit set.\n   The following property tags are defined:\n   issue <Issuer Domain\
    \ Name> [; <name>=<value> ]* :  The issue property\n      entry authorizes the\
    \ holder of the domain name <Issuer Domain\n      Name> or a party acting under\
    \ the explicit authority of the holder\n      of that domain name to issue certificates\
    \ for the domain in which\n      the property is published.\n   issuewild <Issuer\
    \ Domain Name> [; <name>=<value> ]* :  The issuewild\n      property entry authorizes\
    \ the holder of the domain name <Issuer\n      Domain Name> or a party acting\
    \ under the explicit authority of the\n      holder of that domain name to issue\
    \ wildcard certificates for the\n      domain in which the property is published.\n\
    \   iodef <URL> :  Specifies a URL to which an issuer MAY report\n      certificate\
    \ issue requests that are inconsistent with the issuer's\n      Certification\
    \ Practices or Certificate Policy, or that a\n      Certificate Evaluator may\
    \ use to report observation of a possible\n      policy violation.  The Incident\
    \ Object Description Exchange Format\n      (IODEF) format is used [RFC5070].\n\
    \   The following example is a DNS zone file (see [RFC1035]) that informs\n  \
    \ CAs that certificates are not to be issued except by the holder of\n   the domain\
    \ name 'ca.example.net' or an authorized agent thereof.\n   This policy applies\
    \ to all subordinate domains under example.com.\n   $ORIGIN example.com\n   .\
    \       CAA 0 issue \"ca.example.net\"\n   If the domain name holder specifies\
    \ one or more iodef properties, a\n   certificate issuer MAY report invalid certificate\
    \ requests to that\n   address.  In the following example, the domain name holder\
    \ specifies\n   that reports may be made by means of email with the IODEF data\
    \ as an\n   attachment, a Web service [RFC6546], or both:\n   $ORIGIN example.com\n\
    \   .       CAA 0 issue \"ca.example.net\"\n   .       CAA 0 iodef \"mailto:security@example.com\"\
    \n   .       CAA 0 iodef \"http://iodef.example.com/\"\n   A certificate issuer\
    \ MAY specify additional parameters that allow\n   customers to specify additional\
    \ parameters governing certificate\n   issuance.  This might be the Certificate\
    \ Policy under which the\n   certificate is to be issued, the authentication process\
    \ to be used\n   might be specified, or an account number specified by the CA\
    \ to\n   enable these parameters to be retrieved.\n   For example, the CA 'ca.example.net'\
    \ has requested its customer\n   'example.com' to specify the CA's account number\
    \ '230123' in each of\n   the customer's CAA records.\n   $ORIGIN example.com\n\
    \   .       CAA 0 issue \"ca.example.net; account=230123\"\n   The syntax of additional\
    \ parameters is a sequence of name-value pairs\n   as defined in Section 5.2.\
    \  The semantics of such parameters is left\n   to site policy and is outside\
    \ the scope of this document.\n   The critical flag is intended to permit future\
    \ versions CAA to\n   introduce new semantics that MUST be understood for correct\n\
    \   processing of the record, preventing conforming CAs that do not\n   recognize\
    \ the new semantics from issuing certificates for the\n   indicated domains.\n\
    \   In the following example, the property 'tbs' is flagged as critical.\n   Neither\
    \ the example.net CA nor any other issuer is authorized to\n   issue under either\
    \ policy unless the processing rules for the 'tbs'\n   property tag are understood.\n\
    \   $ORIGIN example.com\n   .       CAA 0 issue \"ca.example.net; policy=ev\"\n\
    \   .       CAA 128 tbs \"Unknown\"\n   Note that the above restrictions only\
    \ apply at certificate issue.\n   Since the validity of an end entity certificate\
    \ is typically a year\n   or more, it is quite possible that the CAA records published\
    \ at a\n   domain will change between the time a certificate was issued and\n\
    \   validation by a relying party.\n"
- title: 4.  Certification Authority Processing
  contents:
  - "4.  Certification Authority Processing\n   Before issuing a certificate, a compliant\
    \ CA MUST check for\n   publication of a relevant CAA Resource Record set.  If\
    \ such a record\n   set exists, a CA MUST NOT issue a certificate unless the CA\n\
    \   determines that either (1) the certificate request is consistent with\n  \
    \ the applicable CAA Resource Record set or (2) an exception specified\n   in\
    \ the relevant Certificate Policy or Certification Practices\n   Statement applies.\n\
    \   A certificate request MAY specify more than one domain name and MAY\n   specify\
    \ wildcard domains.  Issuers MUST verify authorization for all\n   the domains\
    \ and wildcard domains specified in the request.\n   The search for a CAA record\
    \ climbs the DNS name tree from the\n   specified label up to but not including\
    \ the DNS root '.'.\n   Given a request for a specific domain X, or a request\
    \ for a wildcard\n   domain *.X, the relevant record set R(X) is determined as\
    \ follows:\n   Let CAA(X) be the record set returned in response to performing\
    \ a CAA\n   record query on the label X, P(X) be the DNS label immediately above\n\
    \   X in the DNS hierarchy, and A(X) be the target of a CNAME or DNAME\n   alias\
    \ record specified at the label X.\n   o  If CAA(X) is not empty, R(X) = CAA (X),\
    \ otherwise\n   o  If A(X) is not null, and R(A(X)) is not empty, then R(X) =\n\
    \      R(A(X)), otherwise\n   o  If X is not a top-level domain, then R(X) = R(P(X)),\
    \ otherwise\n   o  R(X) is empty.\n   For example, if a certificate is requested\
    \ for X.Y.Z the issuer will\n   search for the relevant CAA record set in the\
    \ following order:\n      X.Y.Z\n      Alias (X.Y.Z)\n      Y.Z\n      Alias (Y.Z)\n\
    \      Z\n      Alias (Z)\n      Return Empty\n"
- title: 4.1.  Use of DNS Security
  contents:
  - "4.1.  Use of DNS Security\n   Use of DNSSEC to authenticate CAA RRs is strongly\
    \ RECOMMENDED but not\n   required.  An issuer MUST NOT issue certificates if\
    \ doing so would\n   conflict with the relevant CAA Resource Record set, irrespective\
    \ of\n   whether the corresponding DNS records are signed.\n   DNSSEC provides\
    \ a proof of non-existence for both DNS domains and RR\n   set within domains.\
    \  DNSSEC verification thus enables an issuer to\n   determine if the answer to\
    \ a CAA record query is empty because the RR\n   set is empty or if it is non-empty\
    \ but the response has been\n   suppressed.\n   Use of DNSSEC allows an issuer\
    \ to acquire and archive a proof that\n   they were authorized to issue certificates\
    \ for the domain.\n   Verification of such archives MAY be an audit requirement\
    \ to verify\n   CAA record processing compliance.  Publication of such archives\
    \ MAY\n   be a transparency requirement to verify CAA record processing\n   compliance.\n"

  - "5.1.  Syntax\n   A CAA RR contains a single property entry consisting of a tag-value\n\

    \ than the example.net certificate issuer.\n   certs.example.com       CAA 0 issue\
    \ \"example.net\"\n   CAA authorizations are additive; thus, the result of specifying\
    \ both\n   the empty issuer and a specified issuer is the same as specifying\n\
    \   just the specified issuer alone.\n   An issuer MAY choose to specify issuer-parameters\
    \ that further\n   constrain the issue of certificates by that issuer, for example,\n\
    \   specifying that certificates are to be subject to specific validation\n  \
    \ polices, billed to certain accounts, or issued under specific trust\n   anchors.\n\
    \   The semantics of issuer-parameters are determined by the issuer\n   alone.\n"

  contents:
  - "5.3.  CAA issuewild Property\n   The issuewild property has the same syntax and\
    \ semantics as the issue\n   property except that issuewild properties only grant\
    \ authorization to\n   issue certificates that specify a wildcard domain and issuewild\n\
    \   properties take precedence over issue properties when specified.\n   Specifically:\n\
    \      issuewild properties MUST be ignored when processing a request for\n  \
    \    a domain that is not a wildcard domain.\n      If at least one issuewild\
    \ property is specified in the relevant\n      CAA record set, all issue properties\
    \ MUST be ignored when\n      processing a request for a domain that is a wildcard\
    \ domain.\n"
- title: 5.4.  CAA iodef Property
  contents:
  - "5.4.  CAA iodef Property\n   The iodef property specifies a means of reporting\
    \ certificate issue\n   requests or cases of certificate issue for the corresponding\
    \ domain\n   that violate the security policy of the issuer or the domain name\n\
    \   holder.\n   The Incident Object Description Exchange Format (IODEF) [RFC5070]\
    \ is\n   used to present the incident report in machine-readable form.\n   The\
    \ iodef property takes a URL as its parameter.  The URL scheme type\n   determines\
    \ the method used for reporting:\n   mailto:  The IODEF incident report is reported\
    \ as a MIME email\n      attachment to an SMTP email that is submitted to the\
    \ mail address\n      specified.  The mail message sent SHOULD contain a brief\
    \ text\n      message to alert the recipient to the nature of the attachment.\n\
    \   http or https:  The IODEF report is submitted as a Web service\n      request\

- title: 6.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "6.  Security Considerations\n   CAA records assert a security policy that the\
    \ holder of a domain name\n   wishes to be observed by certificate issuers.  The\
    \ effectiveness of\n   CAA records as an access control mechanism is thus dependent\
    \ on\n   observance of CAA constraints by issuers.\n   The objective of the CAA\
    \ record properties described in this document\n   is to reduce the risk of certificate\
    \ mis-issue rather than avoid\n   reliance on a certificate that has been mis-issued.\
    \  DANE [RFC6698]\n   describes a mechanism for avoiding reliance on mis-issued\n\
    \   certificates.\n"
- title: 6.1.  Non-Compliance by Certification Authority
  contents:
  - "6.1.  Non-Compliance by Certification Authority\n   CAA records offer CAs a cost-effective\
    \ means of mitigating the risk\n   of certificate mis-issue: the cost of implementing\
    \ CAA checks is very\n   small and the potential costs of a mis-issue event include\
    \ the\n   removal of an embedded trust anchor.\n"
- title: 6.2.  Mis-Issue by Authorized Certification Authority
  contents:
  - "6.2.  Mis-Issue by Authorized Certification Authority\n   Use of CAA records\
    \ does not prevent mis-issue by an authorized\n   Certification Authority, i.e.,\
    \ a CA that is authorized to issue\n   certificates for the domain in question\
    \ by CAA records.\n   Domain name holders SHOULD verify that the CAs they authorize\
    \ to\n   issue certificates for their domains employ appropriate controls to\n\
    \   ensure that certificates are issued only to authorized parties within\n  \
    \ their organization.\n   Such controls are most appropriately determined by the\
    \ domain name\n   holder and the authorized CA(s) directly and are thus out of\
    \ scope of\n   this document.\n"

  contents:
  - "6.3.  Suppression or Spoofing of CAA Records\n   Suppression of the CAA record\
    \ or insertion of a bogus CAA record\n   could enable an attacker to obtain a\
    \ certificate from an issuer that\n   was not authorized to issue for that domain\
    \ name.\n   Where possible, issuers SHOULD perform DNSSEC validation to detect\n\
    \   missing or modified CAA record sets.\n   In cases where DNSSEC is not deployed\
    \ in a corresponding domain, an\n   issuer SHOULD attempt to mitigate this risk\
    \ by employing appropriate\n   DNS security controls.  For example, all portions\
    \ of the DNS lookup\n   process SHOULD be performed against the authoritative\
    \ name server.\n   Data cached by third parties MUST NOT be relied on but MAY\
    \ be used to\n   support additional anti-spoofing or anti-suppression controls.\n"
- title: 6.4.  Denial of Service
  contents:
  - "6.4.  Denial of Service\n   Introduction of a malformed or malicious CAA RR could\
    \ in theory\n   enable a Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack.\n   This specific threat\
    \ is not considered to add significantly to the\n   risk of running an insecure\
    \ DNS service.\n   An attacker could, in principle, perform a DoS attack against\
    \ an\n   issuer by requesting a certificate with a maliciously long DNS name.\n\
    \   In practice, the DNS protocol imposes a maximum name length and CAA\n   processing\
    \ does not exacerbate the existing need to mitigate DoS\n   attacks to any meaningful\
    \ degree.\n"
- title: 6.5.  Abuse of the Critical Flag
  contents:
  - "6.5.  Abuse of the Critical Flag\n   A Certification Authority could make use\
    \ of the critical flag to\n   trick customers into publishing records that prevent\
    \ competing\n   Certification Authorities from issuing certificates even though\
    \ the\n   customer intends to authorize multiple providers.\n   In practice, such\
    \ an attack would be of minimal effect since any\n   competent competitor that\
    \ found itself unable to issue certificates\n   due to lack of support for a property\
    \ marked critical SHOULD\n   investigate the cause and report the reason to the\
    \ customer.  The\n   customer will thus discover that they had been deceived.\n"
