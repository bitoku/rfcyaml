  - "1. Introduction\n   Due to the tremendous growth and development of international\n\
    \   computer networks we have nowadays the possibility to overcome -\n   without\
    \ having to travel - geographical distances when working\n   together with other\
    \ people. Besides the possibility of using the\n   telephone we may use electronic\
    \ data exchange to discuss working\n   documents, new ideas, plans or whatsoever.\
    \ One of the most popular\n   means for this is electronic mail, which can be\
    \ used to exchange\n   all kinds of electronic data: from informal pure text messages\
    \ to\n   formatted and multi-media documents.\n   As the number of people connected\
    \ to computer networks grows (and\n   it does continuously, it is at least doubling\
    \ each year!), it\n   becomes more difficult to track down people's electronic\
    \ (mail)\n   addresses. Hence, in order to make global communication over\n  \
    \ computer networks work, a global White Pages service is\n   indispensable. Such\
    \ a service should of course provide people's\n   electronic mail addresses, but\
    \ could also easily contain telephone\n   and fax numbers and postal addresses.\n\
    \   Currently, one technical solution for a globally distributed\n   White Pages\
    \ service is X.500 and there exists an international\n   infrastructure based\
    \ on X.500 technology called 'Paradise'\n   (Piloting An inteRnationAl DIrectory\
    \ SErvice), which contains about\n   1.5 million entries belonging to persons\
    \ and 3,000 belonging to\n   organisations. Worldwide 35 countries are involved.\
    \ Paradise is\n   also a project of the EC. The project continues until September\n\
    \   1994. Afterwards its operational tasks will be taken over by a\n   European\
    \ service provider for the R&D community (DANTE).\n   The goal of Paradise and\
    \ related national initiatives is to\n   stimulate and extend the use of the X.500\
    \ White Pages service.\n   Within the pilot attention is paid to technical and\
    \ organisational\n   aspects. The Paradise infrastructure is mainly based on the\n\
    \   Internet Protocol. The specific issues that are related to the use\n   of\
    \ the Internet Protocol for X.500 can be found in [5].\n   In the decision process\
    \ of joining the international X.500\n   infrastructure and opening (part) of\
    \ the local (address)\n   information to the outside world, it is important that\
    \ an\n   organisation fully understands the technical and organisational\n   issues\
    \ that are involved.\n   This document tries to be of help in this matter first\
    \ by\n   explaining the main concepts of X.500 (section 2) and subsequently\n\
    \   by pointing out its benefits (section 3), the organisational\n   aspects that\
    \ are involved (section 4), and for which other\n   applications the X.500 infrastructure\
    \ may be used in the near\n   future (section 5).\n"
- title: 2. Concept of X.500
  contents:
  - "2. Concept of X.500\n   The X.500 standard describes a so-called 'Directory Service',\
    \ which\n   can be used for all types of electronic directories. This document\n\
    \   focusses on the use of X.500 for a global White Pages Directory.\n   The concept\
    \ of X.500 may roughly be divided in the 'Directory\n   model' and the 'Information\
    \ model'.\n   2.1  Directory model\n   X.500 uses a distributed approach to achieve\
    \ the goal of a global\n   Directory Service. The idea is that local (communication\
    \ oriented)\n   information of an organisation is maintained locally in one or\
    \ more\n   so called Directory System Agents (DSA's). 'Locally' is a flexible\n\
    \   expression here: it is possible that one DSA keeps information of\n   more\
    \ than one organisation. A DSA essentially is a database:\n      - in which the\
    \ information is stored according to the X.500\n        standard (see section\
    \ 2.2),\n      - that has the ability, where necessary, to exchange data\n   \
    \     with other DSA's.\n   Through the communication among each other the DSA's\
    \ form the\n   Directory Information Tree (DIT). The DIT is a virtual hierarchical\n\
    \   datastructure consisting of a 'root', below which 'countries' are\n   defined.\
    \ Below the countries (usually) 'organisations' are defined,\n   and below an\
    \ organisation 'persons', or first additional\n   'organisational units', are\
    \ defined (see the simplified illustration\n   below where only three countries\
    \ and no organisational units are\n   presented). The DIT is a representation\
    \ of the global Directory.\n             root                      o\n       \
    \                               /|\\\n                                     / |\
    \ \\\n                                    /  |  \\\n             countries   \
    \         uk   de  fr\n                                 / |   /\\   |\\\n    \
    \                            /  |  /  \\  | \\\n             organisations   \
    \  a   b c    d e  f\n                               |   | |    | |  |\n     \
    \        persons          ..  .. ...  .... ...\n   Each DSA holds a part of the\
    \ global Directory and is able to find\n   out, through the hierarchical DIT structure,\
    \ which DSA holds which\n   parts of the Directory.\n   The standard does not\
    \ describe how to distribute different part of\n   the Directory among DSA's.\
    \ However, the information corresponding to\n   a single node of the DIT (i.e.,\
    \ a country, organisation, person)\n   cannot be distributed over several DSA's.\
    \ In practice a large\n   organisation will maintain one or more DSA's that hold\
    \ its part of\n   the Directory. Smaller organisations may share a DSA with other\n\
    \   organisations.The distribution among the DSA's is totally transparent\n  \
    \ to the users of the Directory.\n   A user of the Directory can be a person or\
    \ a computer. A user\n   accesses the Directory through a so-called Directory\
    \ User Agent\n   (DUA). The DUA automatically contacts a nearby DSA by means of\
    \ which\n   the user may search or browse through the DIT and retrieve\n   corresponding\
    \ information. A DUA can be implemented in all sorts of\n   user interfaces. Therefore\
    \ users may access the Directory through\n   dedicated DUA interfaces or for example\
    \ e-mail applications.\n   Currently most DUA nterfaces to be used by persons\
    \ are dedicated, but\n   it is expected that in the near future a lot of DUA interfaces\
    \ will\n   be integrated with other applications.\n"
- title: 2.2 Information Model
  contents:
  - "2.2 Information Model\n   Besides the Directory model, the X.500 standard also\
    \ defines the\n   information model used in the Directory Service.\n   All information\
    \ in the Directory is stored in 'entries', each of\n   which belongs to at least\
    \ one so-called 'object class'. In the White\n   Pages application of X.500, on\
    \ which we focus here, object classes\n   are defined such as 'country', 'organisation',\
    \ 'organisational unit'\n   and 'person'.\n   The actual information in an entry\
    \ is determined by so-called\n   'attributes' which are contained in that entry.\
    \ The object classes to\n   which an entry belongs define what types of attributes\
    \ an entry may\n   use and hence what information is specific for entries belonging\
    \ to\n   that object class. The object class 'person' for example allows\n   attribute\
    \ types like 'common name', 'telephone number', and 'e-mail\n   address' to be\
    \ used and the object class 'organisation' allows for\n   attribute types like\
    \ 'organisation name' and 'business category'.\n   Dependent on its type an attribute\
    \ can take one or more values.\n   To specify the name of an entry in the DIT,\
    \ at least one attribute\n   value of the entry is used. The entry of a person\
    \ is usually named\n   after the value of the attribute type 'common name'. The\
    \ name of an\n   entry must be unique on the same level in the subtree of the\
    \ DIT to\n   which the entry belongs.\n   An example of an entry belonging to\
    \ the object class 'person' is:\n       Attribute type              Attribute\
    \ value\n       --------------              --------------\n       Object Class:\
    \               top\n                                   person\n       Common\

- title: 3.  Benefits of X.500
  contents:
  - "3.  Benefits of X.500\n   Why should one use X.500 for a local White Pages service?\
    \ Here are\n   some good arguments:\n      - The distributed character of the\
    \ service. A large\n        organisation may distribute the responsibility for\
    \ the\n        management of the information it presents through X.500 by\n  \
    \      distributing this information over several DSA's (without\n        losing\
    \ the overall structure)\n      - The flexibility of the service. Besides for\
    \ public purposes,\n        X.500 may also be used for specific private Directory\
    \ Service\n        applications. Whereas the definitions of the DIT, object\n\
    \        classes and attribute types of the public White Pages\n        information\
    \ within an organisation have to conform to those\n        of the rest of world,\
    \ the internal applications may use their\n        own DIT structure and their\
    \ own definitions of object classes\n        and attributes (the values being\
    \ only visible within (a part)\n        of the organisation). Nevertheless one\
    \ local infrastructure\n        can be used for both the public and private computers.\n\
    \      - Good alternative for paper Directories. The provision of\n        White\
    \ Pages services based on X.500 may be a good alternative\n        for paper directories,\
    \ because the latter directories are\n        rarely up-to-date (due to the printing\
    \ costs) and because\n        X.500 not only can be used by humans but also by\n\
    \        applications.\n   Some important arguments in favour of X.500 for global\
    \ use are:\n      - By its distributed nature X.500 is particularly suited for\
    \ a\n        large global White Pages directory. Maintenance can take\n      \
    \  place in a distributed way.\n      - Good searching capabilities. X.500 offers\
    \ the possibility to\n        do searches in any level or in any subtree of the\
    \ DIT. In\n        order to do a search an attribute type together with a value\n\
    \        have to be specified. Then the Directory searches for all\n        entries\
    \ that contain an attribute of that type with the given\n        value. For example\
    \ one can search for all persons in an\n        organisation having a particular\
    \ common name, or all\n        organisations within a country that have telecommunications\n\
    \        as their business category. It is up to the organisations\n        that\
    \ maintain the DSA's to decide who may perform which\n        searches and also\
    \ how many levels deep a search may be.\n        Searches can be done on the basis\
    \ of an exact or approximate\n        match. It is worthwile to note that distributed\
    \ searches\n        (that need connections to a lot of DSA's) may be expensive\n\
    \        and are generally not encouraged.\n      - There are DUA interfaces for\
    \ the White Pages service\n        availablefor all types of workstations (DOS,\
    \ Macintosh OS,\n        Unix). For an overview of X.500 available software see\n\
    \        RFC 1292 [2] or updates of this document.\n      - X.500 is an international\
    \ standard. Using a standard\n        obviously means less problems with interoperability\
    \ and\n        interworking.Also the standard is updated according to\n      \
    \  practical experience.\n"
- title: 4.  Organisational aspects of X.500 (experience from Paradise)
  contents:
  - "4.  Organisational aspects of X.500 (experience from Paradise)\n   The organisational\
    \ aspects involved in operating a local X.500 (or\n   any other electronic) Directory\
    \ can roughly be divided in   three\n   sub-aspects:datamanagement, legal issues\
    \ and cost aspects. With\n   respect to cost aspects there is no publicly known\
    \ model or\n   experience at the moment.\n   Therefore the focus in this document\
    \ is on datamanagement and legal\n   issues.\n   Data management refers to issues\
    \ that are related to inserting\n   appropriate information into the Directory\
    \ and keeping it up to date.\n   From the experience of participants in Paradise\
    \ we obtain that the\n   following items are of first importance:\n      - Executive\
    \ commitment. Without this it is almost impossible to\n        create an organisation\
    \ wide up-to-date electronic Directory.\n      - Structure of the local DIT. In\
    \ joining the international\n        infrastructure an organisation has to conform\
    \ to some rules\n        for the local DIT structure as presented to the global\
    \ X.500\n        infrastructure. A recommendation on how to structure a local\n\
    \        DIT and how to use the available attributes can be found in\n       \
    \ [7]. The most important recommendation in the latter document\n        is to\
    \ keep the local part of the DIT as simple (flat) as\n        possible. The reason\
    \ is that users from outside the\n        organisation may otherwise have difficulties\
    \ in finding\n        entries of persons within the organisation (searches in\
    \ the\n        DIT are often only allowed one level deep).\n      - Attributes\
    \ to be used. For the existing infrastructure the\n        objects and associated\
    \ attributes that are globally used, are\n        documented in [1].\n      -\
    \ Sources of the data. An organisation has to find out where to\n        get what\
    \ kind of data and develop procedures for uploading\n        its DSA('s).\n  \
    \    - Delegating responsibilities for updates. Procedures have to\n        bedeveloped\
    \ for updates of the local Directory. These\n        procedures have to include\
    \ delegation of responsibilities.\n      - Security procedures. Rules have to\
    \ be set for access and\n        security. Who may contact the DSA? Who will have\
    \ access to\n        which subtrees and what attributes?\n   A study of the legal\
    \ consequences of presenting (address) information\n   via X.500 lead to the main\
    \ conclusion that in Europe an organisation\n   has to formally register its data\
    \ collections.  Registration implies\n   defining a goal for the application.\
    \ This has to be done for the\n   White Pages service as well as for any deviating\
    \ local application of\n   X.500. However, the different national laws may differ\
    \ with respect\n   to legal restrictions. For more information on this subject\
    \ we refer\n   to \"Building a Directory Service, Final Report test phase SURFnet\n\
    \   X.500 pilot project\", E.  Huizer, SURFnet B.V., Utrecht NL, 1994.\n   (copies\
    \ available from SURFnet B.V.)\n   Among the Paradise members there are several\
    \ pilots running at the\n   moment with the goal to evaluate the organisational\
    \ aspects. Case\n   studies coming from these pilots will be documented.\n   Small\
    \ or medium size organisations that have not too many entries to\n   insert in\
    \ the Directory may use one of the different national\n   initiatives concerning\
    \ a 'central DSA'. These central DSA's are\n   operated by national service providers\
    \ and contain the White Pages\n   information of a lot of small and medium size\
    \ organisations. For\n   organisations in countries without such a national service\
    \ there is\n   also a European central DSA (Paradise) and an American central\
    \ DSA\n   (InterNIC). It is worth noting that the central DSA services are only\n\
    \   technical services, i.e., a participating organisation still has to\n   cover\
    \ the organisational issues. However, part of a central DSA\n   service may be\
    \ consultancy with respect to datamanagement and legal\n   issues.\n"
- title: 5.  Applications of X.500
  contents:
  - "5.  Applications of X.500\n   Besides for White Pages, X.500 can be useful for\
    \ all kinds of\n   distributed information storage from which humans or machines\
    \ can\n   benefit. Examples that are likely to use X.500 in the near future\n\
    \   are: distribution list mechanism, public key distribution for Privacy\n  \
    \ Enhanced Mail (PEM), routing of X.400 messages, distribution of EDI\n   identifiers,\
    \ etc. For more information we refer to [7]. Below the\n   first three applications\
    \ are briefly discussed.\n   The distribution list mechanism uses X.500 for finding\
    \ the e-mail\n   addresses of the persons that have subscribed to a list. The\n\
    \   distributed approach of X.500 makes it possible that people change\n   their\
    \ e-mail address without having to change their subscription to\n   distribution\
    \ lists.\n   PEM (see a.o. [8] or [4]) uses a public key mechanism for exchanging\n\
    \   secure e-mail messages. For example: one will be able to end a secure\n  \
    \ message by encrypting a message with the publicly known (public) key\n   of\
    \ the recipient. Only the recipient of the message can decipher the\n   message\
    \ using his/her private key. In order to make such a mechanism\n   work one must\
    \ have access to the public keys of all possible\n   recipients. X.500 can be\
    \ used for this purpose.\n   At this moment a world-wide pilot is running in which\
    \ X.400 routing\n   is done by means of X.500. X.400 MTA's use special DUA's to\
    \ find via\n   the Directory the MTA's to which the recipients of a message want\n\
    \   their mail to be delivered. The distributed approach of X.500 will\n   mean\
    \ much less routing management (currently tables are used that\n   have to be\
    \ updated/exchanged periodically).\n"
