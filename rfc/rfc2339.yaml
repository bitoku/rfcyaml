  - "Note:\n   This RFC is NOT a standard.  It is an official public record of an\n\
    \   agreement between Sun Microsystems and the Internet Society.  The\n   referenced\
    \ RFCs 1094 dated March 1989 (\"NFS: Network File System\n   Protocol Specification\"\
    ) and 1813 dated June 1995 (\"NFS Version 3\n   Protocol Specification\") are\
    \ not attached to the document below, but\n   are incorporated by reference.\n\
    \                  AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE INTERNET SOCIETY,\n                 \
    \  THE IETF, AND SUN MICROSYSTEMS, INC.\n                    IN THE MATTER OF\
    \ NFS V.4 PROTOCOLS\n   This Agreement is made this 3rd day of March, 1998 by\
    \ and between Sun\n   Microsystems, Inc. (\"Donor\") and the Internet Society.\
    \  In\n   consideration of the mutual covenants and conditions set forth below,\n\
    \   the parties hereto agree as follows:\n   1. License Grant.  For good and valuable\
    \ consideration, receipt and\n   sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged,\
    \ and solely for the\n   purpose specified in Paragraph 2 below, Donor hereby\
    \ grants to the\n   Internet Society (\"Licensees\" which, for the purposes of\
    \ this\n   Agreement, shall include the Internet Engineering Task Force\n   (\"\
    IETF\"), the IETF Secretariat, and their respective members,\n   officers, employees,\
    \ contractors and participating individuals) a\n   cost-free, perpetual, non-exclusive,\
    \ worldwide right and license\n   under any copyrights owned or otherwise licensable\
    \ by Donor, under\n   any Sun patent rights that are essential to practice the\n\
    \   Specification, and any other Sun intellectual property rights to use,\n  \
    \ reproduce, distribute, perform, display and prepare derivative works\n   of\
    \ the Specification, and to authorize others to do so.  For the\n   purposes of\
    \ this Agreement, \"Specification\" means the technical\n   specification described\
    \ more fully in Exhibit A, which Donor will\n   make available as the initial\
    \ point for development of the\n   specification for NFS Version 4 as described\
    \ hereunder, together with\n   any technical specifications based thereon developed\
    \ by Licensees.\n   2. Statement of Purpose.  The licenses granted in Section\
    \ 1 are\n   granted for the sole purpose of seeking to make the Specification\
    \ an\n   Internet standard.\n   3. Evolution of the Specification.  Donor further\
    \ grants to Licensees\n   a worldwide right and license to further evolve, develop\
    \ and modify\n   the Specification for the purpose of making the Specification\
    \ an\n   Internet Standard through the Internet Standardization Process (as\n\
    \   specified in RFC 2026); Donor may not grant a license involving the\n   Specification\
    \ to any other party, including any standards group, that\n   would authorize\
    \ such party to evolve, develop, modify or promote the\n   Specification as a\
    \ standard.  In particular, Donor acknowledges that\n   if it performs any evolution,\
    \ development or modification of the\n   Specification outside of the Internet\
    \ Standardization Process, that\n   this should be clearly indicated as being\
    \ a non-standard development,\n   and that no reference to the Internet Standards\
    \ Process is allowed\n   for any such Specification developed outside of the Internet\n\
    \   Standards Process.\n   4. Non-Confidentiality.  Donor hereby acknowledges\
    \ that Licensees\n   assume no obligation to maintain any confidentiality with\
    \ respect to\n   the Specification licensed hereunder.  Licensees acknowledge\
    \ that any\n   rights not expressly granted herein are reserved by Donor.  Donor\n\
    \   represents that, to the best of its knowledge, there are no\n   infringement\
    \ claims against the Specification.\n   5. Future License.  Donor hereby acknowledges\
    \ that Licensees have no\n   duty to publish or otherwise use or disseminate the\
    \ Specification,\n   including, in particular, an obligation to raise the Specification\
    \ to\n   the Internet standards-track.  Provided that the Specification is\n \
    \  elevated to \"Proposed Standard\" level within 24 months of the\n   execution\
    \ of this Agreement, Donor hereby agrees to license the\n   Specification to others\
    \ at no charge and otherwise under\n   substantially similar terms as those granted\
    \ to Licensee herein (with\n   the exception that such use of the Specification\
    \ by such Licensees\n   shall be for purposes of implementing and complying with\
    \ the Standard\n   rather than for making the Specification an Internet Standard),\
    \ so\n   long as such licensees of the Specification implement and comply with\n\
    \   the Internet standard.  In the event the Specification is not\n   elevated\
    \ to \"Proposed Standard\" level within 24 months of the\n   execution of this\
    \ Agreement, then the license granted in Section 3 of\n   this agreement shall\
    \ terminate.\n   6. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.   THE SPECIFICATION IS PROVIDED TO\n\
    \   LICENSEES \"AS IS\", AND ALL REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR\n\
    \   IMPLIED, INCLUDING FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  MERCHANTABILITY\n  \
    \ AND NONINFRINGEMENT ARE HEREBY DISCLAIMED.\n   7. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. \
    \ IN NO EVENT WILL DONOR BE LIABLE FOR ANY\n   LOST REVENUE, PROFITS OR DATA,\
    \ OR FOR DIRECT, SPECIAL, INDIRECT,\n   CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL OR PUNITIVE\
    \ DAMAGES, HOWEVER CAUSED AND\n   REGARDLESS OF THEORY OF LIABILITY ARISING OUT\
    \ OF THE USE OR INABILITY\n   TO USE THE SPECIFICATION, EVEN IF DONOR HAS BEEN\
    \ ADVISED OF THE\n   POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n   8. Acknowledgment.  Donor\
    \ agrees to permit Licensees to use Donor's\n   name and address to indicate the\
    \ original source of the\n   Specification.\n   9. Miscellaneous.  This Agreement\
    \ constitutes the entire agreement\n   between the parties concerning its subject\
    \ matter, and supersedes all\n   prior written or oral agreements and discussions.\
    \ All additions or\n   modifications to this agreement must be made in writing\
    \ and must be\n   signed by an authorized representative of each party.  If any\
    \ term or\n   condition of this Agreement is declared void or unenforceable as\n\
    \   provided herein or by a court of competent jurisdiction, the\n   remaining\
    \ provisions shall remain in full force and effect. The\n   parties agree to comply\
    \ strictly with all applicable export control\n   laws and regulations.  Where\
    \ no U.S. Federal law governs, this\n   agreement will be governed by the law\
    \ of the State of California\n   without reference to its conflict of laws provision.\n\
    \   IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have caused this Agreement to\n   be\
    \ executed by their duly authorized representatives.\n   Signature /S/ Rich Green\

    \ specifications embodied in RFCs 1094 and 1813, minus\n   the portions of RFCs\
    \ 1094 and 1813 that assume that NFS Version 2 and\n   Version 3 operate over\

    \ the purpose of generating Version\n   numbers 4 and onward.\n   *Note:  ISOC\
