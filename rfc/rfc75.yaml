  - "                            Network Meeting\nTaking advantage of the FJCC in\
    \ Houston, I have scheduled a meeting of\nthe Network Working Group in room Astro\
    \ VII of the Astroworld Hotel at\n8:00 p.m.  on Monday, November 16, 1970.\nThe\
    \ purpose of this meeting is to discuss several topics related to\nthe practical\
    \ use of the network. I have in mind:\n      (a) accounting mechanisms\n     \
    \ (b) documentation distribution\n      (c) person-to-person message sending and\
    \ message storing\n      (d) access to systems by foreign users\nAttendees are\
    \ invited to raise other topics.\nI envision that this meeting will spawn smaller\
    \ subsidiary meetings\nduring the FJCC to pursue these or related topics.\nProspective\
    \ attendees should notify my secretary Benita Kirstel (213)\n825-2368 so that\
    \ we can be sure the room is large enough. Unexpected\nattendees are nevertheless\
    \ invited.\n       [ This RFC was put into machine readable form for entry ]\n\
