- title: Abstract
  contents:
  - "Abstract\n   This document discusses the need for delegation of the IP6.ARPA\
    \ DNS\n   zone, and specifies a plan for the technical operation thereof.\n"
- title: 1. Why IP6.ARPA?
  contents:
  - "1. Why IP6.ARPA?\n   In the IPv6 address space, there is a need for 'reverse\
    \ mapping' of\n   addresses to DNS names analogous to that provided by the IN-ADDR.ARPA\n\
    \   zone for IPv4.\n   The IAB recommended that the ARPA top level domain (the\
    \ name is now\n   considered an acronym for \"Address and Routing Parameters Area\"\
    ) be\n   used for technical infrastructure sub-domains when possible.  It is\n\
    \   already in use for IPv4 reverse mapping and has been established as\n   the\
    \ location for E.164 numbering on the Internet [RFC2916 RFC3026].\n   IETF consensus\
    \ was reached that the IP6.ARPA domain be used for\n   address to DNS name mapping\
    \ for the IPv6 address space [RFC2874].\n"
- title: 2. Obsoleted Usage
  contents:
  - "2. Obsoleted Usage\n   This document deprecates references to IP6.INT in [RFC1886]\
    \ section\n   2.5, [RFC2553] section 6.2.3, [RFC2766] section 4.1, [RFC2772]\n\
    \   section 7.1.c, and [RFC2874] section 2.5.\n   In this context, 'deprecate'\
    \ means that the old usage is not\n   appropriate for new implementations, and\
    \ IP6.INT will likely be\n   phased out in an orderly fashion.\n"
- title: 3. IANA Considerations
  contents:
  - "3. IANA Considerations\n   This memo requests that the IANA delegate the IP6.ARPA\
    \ domain\n   following instructions to be provided by the IAB.  Names within this\n\
    \   zone are to be further delegated to the regional IP registries in\n   accordance\
    \ with the delegation of IPv6 address space to those\n   registries.  The names\
    \ allocated should be hierarchic in accordance\n   with the address space assignment.\n"
- title: 4. Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "4. Security Considerations\n   While DNS spoofing of address to name mapping\
    \ has been exploited in\n   IPv4, delegation of the IP6.ARPA zone creates no new\
    \ threats to the\n   security of the internet.\n"
