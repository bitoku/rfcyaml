- title: 4.  HTTP/HTTPS-Based Protocol
  contents:
  - "4.  HTTP/HTTPS-Based Protocol\n   This section describes the conventions for\
    \ use of HTTP [HTTP] as a\n   transport layer.  In most circumstances, the use\
    \ of HTTP over TLS\n   [TLS] provides any necessary content protection from eavesdroppers.\n\
    \   In order for CMC clients and servers using HTTP to interoperate, the\n   following\
    \ rules apply.\n      Clients MUST use the POST method to submit their requests.\n\
    \      Servers MUST use the 200 response code for successful responses.\n    \
    \  Clients MAY attempt to send HTTP requests using TLS 1.0 [TLS] or\n      later,\
    \ although servers are not required to support TLS.\n      Servers MUST NOT assume\
    \ client support for any type of HTTP\n      authentication such as cookies, Basic\
    \ authentication, or Digest\n      authentication.\n      Clients and servers\
    \ are expected to follow the other rules and\n      restrictions in [HTTP].  Note\
    \ that some of those rules are for\n      HTTP methods other than POST; clearly,\
    \ only the rules that apply\n      to POST are relevant for this specification.\n"
- title: 4.1.  PKI Request
  contents:
  - "4.1.  PKI Request\n   A PKI Request using the POST method is constructed as follows:\n\
    \   The Content-Type header MUST have the appropriate value from Table 1.\n  \
    \ The body of the message is the binary value of the encoding of the\n   PKI Request.\n"
- title: 4.2.  PKI Response
  contents:
  - "4.2.  PKI Response\n   An HTTP-based PKI Response is composed of the appropriate\
    \ HTTP\n   headers, followed by the binary value of the BER (Basic Encoding\n\
    \   Rules) encoding of either a Simple or Full PKI Response.\n   The Content-Type\
    \ header MUST have the appropriate value from Table 1.\n"
- title: 5.  TCP-Based Protocol
  contents:
  - "5.  TCP-Based Protocol\n   When CMC messages are sent over a TCP-based connection,\
    \ no wrapping\n   is required of the message.  Messages are sent in their binary\n\
    \   encoded form.\n   The client closes a connection after receiving a response,\
    \ or it\n   issues another request to the server using the same connection.\n\
    \   Reusing one connection for multiple successive requests, instead of\n   opening\
    \ multiple connections that are only used for a single request,\n   is RECOMMENDED\
    \ for performance and resource conservation reasons.  A\n   server MAY close a\
    \ connection after it has been idle for some period\n   of time; this timeout\
    \ would typically be several minutes long.\n   There is no specific port that\
    \ is to be used when doing TCP-based\n   transport.  Only the Private Ports 49152-65535\
    \ may be used in this\n   manner (without registration).  The ports in the range\
    \ of 1-49151\n   SHOULD NOT be used.  The port to be used is configured out of\
    \ band.\n"
- title: 6.   Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "6.   Security Considerations\n   Mechanisms for thwarting replay attacks may\
    \ be required in particular\n   implementations of this protocol depending on\
    \ the operational\n   environment.  In cases where the Certification Authority\
    \ (CA)\n   maintains significant state information, replay attacks may be\n  \
    \ detectable without the inclusion of the optional nonce mechanisms.\n   Implementers\
    \ of this protocol need to carefully consider\n   environmental conditions before\
    \ choosing whether or not to implement\n   the senderNonce and recipientNonce\
    \ attributes described in Section\n   6.6 of [CMC-STRUCT].  Developers of state-constrained\
    \ PKI clients are\n   strongly encouraged to incorporate the use of these attributes.\n\
    \   Initiation of a secure communications channel between an end-entity\n   and\
    \ a CA or Registration Authority (RA) -- and, similarly, between an\n   RA and\
    \ another RA or CA -- necessarily requires an out-of-band trust\n   initiation\
    \ mechanism.  For example, a secure channel may be\n   constructed between the\
    \ end-entity and the CA via IPsec [IPsec] or\n   TLS [TLS].  Many such schemes\
    \ exist, and the choice of any particular\n   scheme for trust initiation is outside\
    \ the scope of this document.\n   Implementers of this protocol are strongly encouraged\
    \ to consider\n   generally accepted principles of secure key management when\n\
    \   integrating this capability within an overall security architecture.\n   In\
    \ some instances, no prior out-of-band trust will have been\n   initiated prior\
    \ to use of this protocol.  This can occur when the\n   protocol itself is being\
    \ used to download onto the system the set of\n   trust anchors to be used for\
    \ these protocols.  In these instances,\n   the Enveloped Data content type (Section\
    \ 3.2.1.3.3 in [CMC-STRUCT])\n   must be used to provide the same shrouding that\
    \ TLS would have\n   provided.\n"
