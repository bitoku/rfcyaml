    \   protocol used for routing in IP networks.  Though the definition of\n   the\
    \ Area Border Router (ABR) in the OSPF specification does not\n   require a router\
    \ with multiple attached areas to have a backbone\n   connection, it is actually\
    \ necessary to provide successful routing to\n   the inter-area and external destinations.\
    \  If this requirement is not\n   met, all traffic destined for the areas not\
    \ connected to such an ABR\n   or out of the OSPF domain, is dropped.  This document\

  - "1.1 Introduction\n   An OSPF routing domain can be split into several subdomains,\
    \ called\n   areas, which limit the scope of LSA flooding.  According to [Ref1]\
    \ a\n   router having attachments to multiple areas is called an \"area border\n\
    \   router\" (ABR).  The primary function of an ABR is to provide its\n   attached\
    \ areas with Type-3 and Type-4 LSAs, which are used for\n   describing routes\
    \ and AS boundary routers (ASBRs) in other areas, as\n   well as to perform actual\
    \ inter-area routing.\n"
- title: 1.2 Motivation
  contents:
  - "1.2 Motivation\n   In OSPF domains the area topology is restricted so that there\
    \ must be\n   a backbone area (area 0) and all other areas must have either\n\
    \   physical or virtual connections to the backbone.  The reason for this\n  \
    \ star-like topology is that OSPF inter-area routing uses the\n   distance-vector\
    \ approach and a strict area hierarchy permits\n   avoidance of the \"counting\
    \ to infinity\" problem.  OSPF prevents\n   inter-area routing loops by implementing\
    \ a split-horizon mechanism,\n   allowing ABRs to inject into the backbone only\
    \ Summary-LSAs derived\n   from the\n   intra-area routes, and limiting ABRs'\
    \ SPF calculation to consider\n   only Summary-LSAs in the backbone area's link-state\
    \ database.\n   The last restriction leads to a problem when an ABR has no backbone\n\
    \   connection (in OSPF, an ABR does not need to be attached to the\n   backbone).\
    \  Consider a sample OSPF domain depicted in the Figure 1.\n                 \
    \         .                .\n                           .    Area 0    .\n  \

    \                  Figure 1. ABR dropping transit traffic\n   In this example\
    \ R1, R2, and R3 are ABRs.  R1 and R2 have backbone\n   connections, while R3\
    \ doesn't.\n   Following the section 12.4.1 of [Ref1], R3 will identify itself\
    \ as an\n   ABR by setting the bit B in its router-LSA.  Being an ABR, R3 can\n\
    \   only consider summary-LSAs from the backbone when building the\n   routing\
    \ table (according to section 16.2 of [Ref1]), so it will not\n   have any inter-area\
    \ routes in its routing table, but only intra-area\n   routes from both Area 1\
    \ and Area 2.  Consequently, according to\n   section 12.4.3 of [Ref1], R3 will\
    \ originate into Areas 1 and 2 only\n   summary-LSAs covering destinations in\
    \ the directly attached areas,\n   i.e., in Area 2---the summary-LSAs for Area\
    \ 1, and in Area 1---the\n   summary-LSAs for Area 2.\n   At the same time, router\
    \ R2, as an ABR connected to the backbone,\n   will inject into Area 2 summary-LSAs\
    \ describing the destinations in\n   Area 0 (the backbone), Area 1 and other areas\
    \ reachable through the\n   backbone.\n   This results in a situation where internal\
    \ router R4 calculates its\n   routes to destinations in the backbone and areas\
    \ other than Area 1\n   via R2.  The topology of Area 2 itself can be such that\
    \ the best path\n   from R4 to R2 is via R3, so all traffic destined for the backbone\
    \ and\n   backbone-attached areas goes through R3.  Router R3 in turn, having\n\
    \   only intra-area routes for areas 1 and 2, will drop all traffic not\n   destined\
    \ for the areas directly attached to it.  The same problem can\n   occur when\
    \ a backbone-connected ABR loses all of its adjacencies in\n   the backbone---even\
    \ if there are other normally functioning ABRs in\n   the attached areas, all\
    \ traffic going to the backbone (destined for\n   it or for other areas) will\
    \ be dropped.\n   In a standard OSPF implementation this situation can be remedied\
    \ by\n   use of Virtual Links (see section 15 of [Ref1] for more details).  In\n\
    \   this case, router R3 will have a virtual backbone connection, will\n   form\
    \ an adjacency over it, will receive all LSAs directly from a\n   backbone-attached\
    \ router (R1 or R2, or both in our example) and will\n   install intra- or inter-area\
    \ routes.\n   While being an unavoidable technique for repairing a partitioned\n\
    \   backbone area, the use of virtual links in the described situation\n   adds\
    \ extra configuration headaches and system traffic overhead.\n   Another situation\
    \ where standard ABR behavior does not provide\n   acceptable results is when\
    \ it is necessary to provide redundant\n   connectivity to an ASBR via several\
    \ different OSPF areas.  This would\n   allow a provider to aggregate all their\
    \ customers connecting through\n   a single access point into one area while still\
    \ offering a redundant\n   connection through another access point in a different\
    \ area, as shown\n   in Figure 2.\n                            .             \

    \ 2. Dual Homed Customer Router\n   This technique is already used in a number\
    \ of networks including one\n   of a major provider.\n   The next section describes\
    \ alternative ABR behaviors, implemented in\n   Cisco and IBM routers.  The changes\
    \ are in the ABR definition and\n   inter-area route calculation.  Any other parts\
    \ of standard OSPF are\n   not changed.\n   These solutions are targeted to the\
    \ situation when an ABR has no\n   backbone connection.  They imply that a router\
    \ connected to multiple\n   areas without a backbone connection is not an ABR\
    \ and should function\n   as a router internal to every attached area.  This solution\
    \ emulates\n   a situation where separate OSPF processes are run for each area\
    \ and\n   supply routes to the routing table.  It remedies the situation\n   described\
    \ in the examples above by not dropping transit traffic.\n   Note that a router\
    \ following it does not function as a real border\n   router---it doesn't originate\
    \ summary-LSAs.  Nevertheless such a\n   behavior may be desirable in certain\
    \ situations.\n   Note that the proposed solutions do not obviate the need of\
    \ virtual\n   link configuration in case an area has no physical backbone\n  \
    \ connection at all.  The methods described here improve the behavior\n   of a\
    \ router connecting two or more backbone-attached areas.\n"

- title: 2.2 Implementation Details
  contents:
  - "2.2 Implementation Details\n   The following changes are made to the base OSPF,\
    \ described in [Ref1]:\n   1.  The algorithm for Type 1 LSA (router-LSA) origination\
    \ is changed\n       to prevent a multi-area connected router from identifying\
    \ itself\n       as an ABR by the bit B (as described in section 12.4.1 of [Ref1])\n\
    \       until it considers itself as an ABR according to the definitions\n   \
    \    given in section 2.1.\n   2.  The algorithm for the routing table calculation\
    \ is changed to\n       allow the router to consider the summary-LSAs from all\
    \ attached\n       areas if it is not an ABR, but has more than one attached area,\n\
    \       or it does not have an Active Backbone Connection.  Definitions\n    \
    \   of the terms used in this paragraph are given in section 2.1.\n       So,\
    \ the paragraph 1 of section 16.2 of [Ref1] should be\n       interpreted as follows:\n\
    \       \"The inter-area routes are calculated by examining summary-LSAs.\n  \
    \     If the router is an ABR and has an Active Backbone Connection,\n       only\
    \ backbone summary-LSAs are examined.  Otherwise (either the\n       router is\
    \ not an ABR or it has no Active Backbone Connection),\n       the router should\
    \ consider summary-LSAs from all Actively\n       Attached areas...\"\n   3. \
    \ For Cisco ABR approach, the algorithm for the summary-LSAs\n       origination\
    \ is changed to prevent loops of summary-LSAs in\n       situations where the\
    \ router considers itself an ABR but doesn't\n       have an Active Backbone Connection\
    \ (and, consequently, examines\n       summaries from all attached areas).  The\
    \ algorithm is changed to\n       allow an ABR to announce only intra-area routes\
    \ in such a\n       situation.\n       So, the paragraph 2 of subsection 12.4.3\
    \ of [Ref1] should be\n       interpreted as follows:\n       \"Summary-LSAs are\
    \ originated by area border routers.  The precise\n       summary routes to advertise\
    \ into an area are determined by\n       examining the routing table structure\
    \ (see Section 11) in\n       accordance with the algorithm described below. \
    \ Note that while\n       only intra-area routes are advertised into the backbone,\
    \ if the\n       router has an Active Backbone Connection, both intra-area and\n\
    \       inter-area routes are advertised into the other areas; otherwise,\n  \
    \     the router only advertises intra-area routes into non-backbone\n       areas.\"\
    \n       For this policy to be applied we change steps 6 and 7 in the\n      \
    \ summary origination algorithm to be as follows:\n       Step 6:\n          \"\
    Else, if the destination of this route is an AS boundary\n          router, a\
    \ summary-LSA should be originated if and only if the\n          routing table\
    \ entry describes the preferred path to the AS\n          boundary router (see\
    \ Step 3 of Section 16.4).  If so, a Type 4\n          summary-LSA is originated\
    \ for the destination, with Link State\n          ID equal to the AS boundary\
    \ router's Router ID and metric\n          equal to the routing table entry's\
    \ cost.  If the ABR\n          performing this algorithm does not have an Active\
    \ Backbone\n          Connection, it can originate Type 4 summary-LSA only if\
    \ the\n          type of the route to the ASBR is intra-area.  Note: Type 4\n\
    \          summary-LSAs should not be generated if Area A has been\n         \
    \ configured as a stub area.\"\n       Step 7:\n          \"Else, the Destination\
    \ type is network.  If this is an\n          inter-area route and the ABR performing\
    \ this algorithm has an\n          Active Backbone Connection, generate a Type\
    \ 3 summary-LSA for\n          the destination, with Link State ID equal to the\
    \ network's\n          address (if necessary, the Link State ID can also have\
    \ one or\n          more of the network's host bits set; see Appendix E for\n\
    \          details) and metric equal to the routing table cost.\"\n   The changes\
    \ in the ABR behavior described in this section allow a\n   multi-area connected\
    \ router to successfully route traffic destined\n   for the backbone and other\
    \ areas.  Note that if the router does not\n   have a backbone area Configured\
    \ it does not actively attract\n   inter-area traffic, because it does not consider\
    \ itself an ABR and\n   does not originate summary-LSAs.  It still can forward\
    \ traffic from\n   one attached area to another along intra-area routes in case\
    \ other\n   routers in corresponding areas have the best inter-area paths over\n\
    \   it, as described in section 1.2.\n   By processing all summaries when the\
    \ backbone is not active, we\n   prevent the ABR, which has just lost its last\
    \ backbone adjacency,\n   from dropping any packets going through the ABR in question\
    \ to\n   another ABR and destined towards the backbone or other areas not\n  \
    \ connected to the ABR directly.\n"
- title: 3 Virtual Link Treatment

  - "3 Virtual Link Treatment\n   The Cisco ABR approach described in this document\
    \ requires an ABR to\n   have at least one active interface in the backbone area.\
    \  This\n   requirement may cause problems with virtual links in those rare\n\
    \   situations where the backbone area is purely virtual, as shown in\n   Figure\
    \ 3, and the state of the VL is determined as in [Ref1].\n                   \

    \ Backbone\n   If R1 and R2 treat virtual links as in [Ref1], their virtual links\n\
    \   will never go up, because their router-LSAs do not contain the B-bit,\n  \
    \ which is, in turn, because the routers do not have active interfaces\n   (virtual\
    \ links) in the backbone and do not consider themselves ABRs.\n   Note that this\
    \ problem does not appear if one of the routers has a\n   real interface in the\
    \ backbone, as it usually is in real networks.\n   Though the situation described\
    \ is deemed to be rather rare,\n   implementations supporting Cisco ABR behavior\
    \ may consider changing\n   VL-specific code so that a virtual link is reported\
    \ up (an\n   InterfaceUp event is generated) when a router with corresponding\n\
    \   router-ID is seen via Dijkstra, no matter whether its router-LSA\n   indicates\
    \ that it is an ABR or not.  This means that checking of\n   configured virtual\
    \ links should be done not in step 4 of the\n   algorithm in 16.1 of [Ref1] when\
    \ a router routing entry is added, but\n   every time a vertex is added to the\
    \ SPT in step 3 of the same\n   algorithm.\n"

    \ approach described in this document.  In this\n   case R2 will have inter-area\
    \ routes to network M via ABR R1 only.  R5\n   in turn will have its inter-area\
    \ route to network N via R4, but as\n   far as R4 is only reachable via R3, all\
    \ traffic destined to network N\n   will pass through R3.  R3 will have an intra-area\
    \ route to network N\n   via R2 and will, of course, route it directly to it (because\n\
    \   intra-area routes are always preferred over inter-area ones).\n   Traffic\
    \ going back from network N to network M will pass through R2\n   and will be\
    \ routed to R1, as R2 will not have any inter-area routes\n   via R3.  So, traffic\
    \ from N to M will always go through the backbone\n   while traffic from M to\
    \ N will cross the areas directly via R3 and,\n   in this example, will not use\
    \ a more optimal path through the\n   backbone.\n   Note that this problem is\
    \ not caused by the fact that R3 uses the\n   alternative approach.  The reason\
    \ for attracting the attention to it\n   is that R3 is not really functioning\
    \ as an ABR in case this new\n   behavior is used, i.e., it does not inject summary-LSAs\
    \ into the\n   attached areas, but inter-area traffic can still go through it.\n"
