  - "1. Introduction\n   New users joining the Internet community for the first time\
    \ have had\n   the same questions as did everyone else who has ever joined.  Our\n\
    \   quest is to provide the Internet community with up to date, basic\n   Internet\
    \ knowledge and experience, while moving the redundancies away\n   from the electronic\
    \ mailing lists so that the lists' subscribers do\n   not have to read the same\
    \ queries and answers over and over again.\n   Future updates of this memo will\
    \ be produced as USWG members become\n   aware of additional questions that should\
    \ be included, and of\n   deficiencies or inaccuracies that should be amended\
    \ in this document.\n   Additional FYI Q/A's will be published which will deal\
    \ with\n   intermediate and advanced Q/A topics.\n   The Q/A mailing lists are\
    \ maintained by Gary Malkin at FTP.COM.  They\n   are used by a subgroup of the\
    \ USWG to discuss the Q/A FYIs.  They\n   include:\n   quail@ftp.com         \
    \  This is a discussion mailing list.  Its\n                           primary\
    \ use is for pre-release (to the\n                           USWG) review of the\
    \ Q/A FYIs.\n   quail-request@ftp.com   This is how you join the quail mailing\
    \ list.\n   quail-box@ftp.com       This is where the questions and answers\n\
    \                           will be forwarded-and-stored.  It is\n           \
    \                not necessary to be on the quail mailing\n                  \

  - "3. Questions About the Internet\n   I just got on the Internet.  What can I do\
    \ now?\n      You now have access to all the resources you are authorized to use\n\
    \      on your own Internet host, on any other Internet host on which you\n  \
    \    have an account, and on any other Internet host that offers\n      publicly\
    \ accessible information.  The Internet gives you the\n      ability to move information\
    \ between these hosts via file\n      transfers.  Once you are logged into one\
    \ host, you can use the\n      Internet to open a connection to another, log in,\
    \ and use its\n      services interactively.  In addition, you can send electronic\
    \ mail\n      to users at any Internet site and to users on many non-Internet\n\
    \      sites that are accessible via electronic mail.\n      There are various\
    \ other services you can use.  For example, some\n      hosts provide access to\
    \ specialized databases or to archives of\n      information.  The Internet Resource\
    \ Guide provides information\n      regarding some of these sites.  The Internet\
    \ Resource Guide lists\n      facilities on the Internet that are available to\
    \ users.  Such\n      facilities include supercomputer centers, library catalogs\
    \ and\n      specialized data collections.  The guide is published by the NSF\n\
    \      Network Service Center (NNSC) and is continuously being updated.\n    \
    \  The Resource Guide is distributed free via e-mail (send a note to\n      resource-guide-request@nnsc.nsf.net\
    \ to join the e-mail\n      distribution) and via anonymous FTP (in nnsc.nsf.net:resource-\n\
    \      guide/*).  Hardcopy is available at a nominal fee (to cover\n      reproduction\
    \ costs) from the NNSC.  Call the NNSC at 617-873-3400\n      for more information.\n\
    \   How do I find out if a site has a computer on the Internet?\n      Three good\
    \ sources to consult are \"!%@:: A Directory of Electronic\n      Mail Addressing\
    \ and Networks\" by Donnalyn Frey and Rick Adams;\n      \"The User's Directory\
    \ to Computer Networks\", by Tracy LaQuey; and\n      \"The Matrix: Computer Networks\
    \ and Conferencing Systems\n      Worldwide\", by John Quarterman.\n      In addition,\
    \ it is possible to find some information about\n      Internet sites in the WHOIS\
    \ database maintained at the DDN NIC at\n      SRI International.  The DDN NIC\
    \ provides an information retrieval\n      interface to the database that is also\
    \ called WHOIS.  To use this\n      interface, Telnet to NIC.DDN.MIL and type\
    \ \"whois\" (carriage\n      return).  No login is necessary.  Type \"help\" at\
    \ the whois prompt\n      for more information on using the facility.  WHOIS will\
    \ show many\n      sites, but may not show every site registered with the DDN\
    \ NIC\n      (simply for reasons having to do with how the program is set up to\n\
    \      search the database).\n"
- title: 4. Questions About TCP/IP
  contents:
  - "4. Questions About TCP/IP\n   What is TCP/IP?\n      TCP/IP (Transmission Control\
    \ Protocol/Internet Protocol) [4,5,6]\n      is the common name for a family of\
    \ data-communications protocols\n      used to tie computers and data-communications\
    \ equipment into\n      computer networks.  TCP/IP originated for use on a network\
    \ called\n      ARPANET, but it is currently used on a large international network\n\
    \      of universities, other research institutions, government\n      facilities,\
    \ and some corporations called the Internet.  TCP/IP is\n      also sometimes\
    \ used for other networks, particularly local area\n      networks that tie together\
    \ numerous different kinds of computers\n      or tie together engineering workstations.\n\
    \   What are the other standard protocols in the TCP/IP family?\n      Other than\
    \ TCP and IP, the three main protocols in the TCP/IP\n      suite are the Simple\
    \ Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP), the File\n      Transfer Protocol (FTP), and\
    \ the Telnet Protocol.  There are many\n      other protocols in use on the Internet.\
    \  The Internet Activities\n      Board (IAB) regularly publishes an RFC [2] that\
    \ describes the\n      state of standardization of the various Internet protocols.\
    \  This\n      document is the best guide to the current status of Internet\n\
    \      protocols and their recommended usage.\n"
- title: 5. Questions About Internet Documentation
  contents:
  - "5. Questions About Internet Documentation\n   What is an RFC?\n      The Request\
    \ for Comments documents (RFCs) are working notes of the\n      Internet research\
    \ and development community.  A document in this\n      series may be on essentially\
    \ any topic related to computer\n      communication, and may be anything from\
    \ a meeting report to the\n      specification of a standard.  Submissions for\
    \ Requests for\n      Comments may be sent to the RFC Editor, Jon Postel\n   \
    \   (POSTEL@ISI.EDU).\n      Most RFCs are the descriptions of network protocols\
    \ or services,\n      often giving detailed procedures and formats providing the\n\
    \      information necessary for creating implementations.  Other RFCs\n     \
    \ report on the results of policy studies or summarize the work of\n      technical\
    \ committees or workshops.\n      While RFCs are not refereed publications, they\
    \ do receive\n      technical review from either the task forces, individual technical\n\
    \      experts, or the RFC Editor, as appropriate.  Currently, most\n      standards\
    \ are published as RFCs, but not all RFCs specify\n      standards.\n      Anyone\
    \ can submit a document for publication as an RFC.\n      Submissions must be\
    \ made via electronic mail to the RFC Editor.\n      RFCs are distributed online\
    \ by being stored as public access\n      files, and a short message is sent to\
    \ the distribution list\n      indicating the availability of the memo.  Requests\
    \ to be added to\n      this distribution list should be sent to RFC-REQUEST@NIC.DDN.MIL.\n\
    \      The online files are copied by interested people and printed or\n     \
    \ displayed at their sites on their equipment.  (An RFC may also be\n      returned\
    \ via electronic mail in response to an electronic mail\n      query.) This means\
    \ that the format of the online files must meet\n      the constraints of a wide\
    \ variety of printing and display\n      equipment.\n      Once a document is\
    \ assigned an RFC number and published, that RFC\n      is never revised or re-issued\
    \ with the same number.  There is\n      never a question of having the most recent\
    \ version of a particular\n      RFC.  However, a protocol (such as File Transfer\
    \ Protocol (FTP))\n      may be improved and re-documented many times in several\
    \ different\n      RFCs.  It is important to verify that you have the most recent\
    \ RFC\n      on a particular protocol.  The \"IAB Official Protocol Standards\"\
    \n      [2] memo is the reference for determining the correct RFC to refer\n \
    \     to for the current specification of each protocol.\n   How do I obtain RFCs?\n\
    \      RFCs can be obtained via FTP from NIC.DDN.MIL, with the pathname\n    \
    \  RFC:RFCnnnn.TXT or RFC:RFCnnnn.PS (where \"nnnn\" refers to the\n      number\
    \ of the RFC).  Login with FTP, username \"anonymous\" and\n      password \"\
    guest\".  The NIC also provides an automatic mail service\n      for those sites\
    \ which cannot use FTP.  Address the request to\n      SERVICE@NIC.DDN.MIL and\
    \ in the subject field of the message\n      indicate the RFC number, as in \"\
    Subject: RFC nnnn\" (or \"Subject:\n      RFC nnnn.PS\" for PostScript RFCs).\n\
    \      RFCs can also be obtained via FTP from NIS.NSF.NET.  Using FTP,\n     \
    \ login with username \"anonymous\" and password \"guest\"; then connect\n   \
    \   to the RFC directory (\"cd RFC\").  The file name is of the form\n      RFCnnnn.TXT-1\
    \ (where \"nnnn\" refers to the number of the RFC).  The\n      NIS also provides\
    \ an automatic mail service for those sites which\n      cannot use FTP.  Address\
    \ the request to NIS-INFO@NIS.NSF.NET and\n      leave the subject field of the\
    \ message blank.  The first line of\n      the text of the message must be \"\
    SEND RFCnnnn.TXT-1\", where nnnn\n      is replaced by the RFC number.\n     \
    \ Requests for special distribution should be addressed to either\n      the author\
    \ of the RFC in question, or to NIC@NIC.DDN.MIL.  Unless\n      specifically noted\
    \ otherwise on the RFC itself, all RFCs are for\n      unlimited distribution.\n\
    \   Which RFCs are Standards?\n      See \"IAB Official Protocol Standards\" (currently,\
    \ RFC 1140) [2].\n   How do I obtain OSI Standards documents from the Internet?\n\
    \      OSI Standards documents are NOT available from the Internet via\n     \
    \ anonymous FTP due to copyright restrictions.  These are available\n      from:\n\
    \         Omnicom Information Service\n         501 Church Street NE\n       \
    \  Suite 304\n         Vienna, VA  22180  USA\n         Telephone: (800) 666-4266\

  - "6. Questions about Internet Organizations and Contacts\n   What is the IAB?\n\
    \      The Internet Activities Board (IAB) is the coordinating committee\n   \
    \   for Internet design, engineering and management [7].  IAB members\n      are\
    \ deeply committed to making the Internet function effectively\n      and evolve\
    \ to meet a large scale, high speed future.  The chairman\n      serves a term\
    \ of two years and is elected by the members of the\n      IAB.  The current Chair\
    \ of the IAB is Vint Cerf.  The IAB focuses\n      on the TCP/IP protocol suite,\
    \ and extensions to the Internet\n      system to support multiple protocol suites.\n\
    \      The IAB performs the following functions:\n         1)   Sets Internet\
    \ Standards,\n         2)   Manages the RFC publication process,\n         3)\
    \   Reviews the operation of the IETF and IRTF,\n         4)   Performs strategic\
    \ planning for the Internet, identifying\n              long-range problems and\
    \ opportunities,\n         5)   Acts as an international technical policy liaison\
    \ and\n              representative for the Internet community, and\n        \
    \ 6)   Resolves technical issues which cannot be treated within\n            \
    \  the IETF or IRTF frameworks.\n      The IAB has two principal subsidiary task\
    \ forces:\n         1)  Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)\n         2)  Internet\
    \ Research Task Force (IRTF)\n      Each of these Task Forces is led by a chairman\
    \ and guided by a\n      Steering Group which reports to the IAB through its chairman.\
    \  For\n      the most part, a collection of Research or Working Groups carries\n\
    \      out the work program of each Task Force.\n      All decisions of the IAB\
    \ are made public.  The principal vehicle\n      by which IAB decisions are propagated\
    \ to the parties interested in\n      the Internet and its TCP/IP protocol suite\
    \ is the Request for\n      Comments (RFC) note series and the Internet Monthly\
    \ Report.\n   What is the IANA?\n      The task of coordinating the use of the\
    \ parameters of protocols is\n      delegated by the Internet Activities Board\
    \ (IAB) to the Internet\n      Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA).  These protocol\
    \ parameters are\n      op-codes, type fields, terminal types, system names, object\n\
    \      identifiers, and so on.  The \"Assigned Numbers\" Request for\n      Comments\
    \ (RFC) [1] documents the currently assigned values from\n      several series\

    \ information on number assignments, contact IANA@ISI.EDU.\n   What is \"The NIC\"\
    ?\n      \"The NIC\" is the Defense Data Network, Network Information Center\n\
    \      (DDN NIC) at SRI International, which is a network information\n      center\
    \ which holds a primary repository for RFCs and Internet\n      drafts.  The host\
    \ name is NIC.DDN.MIL.  Shadow copies of the RFCs\n      and the Internet Drafts\
    \ are maintained by the NSFnet on\n      NNSC.NSF.NET and on MERIT.EDU.\n    \
    \  The DDN NIC also provides various user assistance services for DDN\n      users;\
    \ contact NIC@NIC.DDN.MIL or call 1-800-235-3155 for more\n      information.\
    \  In addition, the DDN NIC is the Internet\n      registration authority for\
    \ the root domain and several top and\n      second level domains; maintains the\
    \ official DoD Internet Host\n      Table; is the site of the Internet Registry\
    \ (IR); and maintains\n      the whois database of network users, hosts, domains,\
    \ networks, and\n      Points of Contact.\n   What is the IR?\n      The Internet\
    \ Registry (IR) is the organization that is responsible\n      for assigning identifiers,\
    \ such as IP network numbers and\n      autonomous system numbers, to networks.\
    \  The IR also gathers and\n      registers such assigned information.  The IR\
    \ may, in the future,\n      allocate the authority to assign network identifiers\
    \ to other\n      organizations; however, it will continue to gather data regarding\n\
    \      such assignments.  At present, the DDN NIC at SRI International\n     \
    \ serves as the IR.\n   What is the IETF?\n      The Internet has grown to encompass\
    \ a large number of widely\n      geographically dispersed networks in academic\
    \ and research\n      communities.  It now provides an infrastructure for a broad\n\
    \      community with various interests.  Moreover, the family of\n      Internet\
    \ protocols and system components has moved from\n      experimental to commercial\
    \ development.  To help coordinate the\n      operation, management and evolution\
    \ of the Internet, the IAB\n      established the Internet Engineering Task Force\
    \ (IETF).\n      The IETF is chaired by Phill Gross and managed by its Internet\n\
    \      Engineering Steering Group (IESG).  The IETF is a large open\n      community\
    \ of network designers, operators, vendors, and\n      researchers concerned with\
    \ the Internet and the Internet protocol\n      suite.  It is organized around\
    \ a set of eight technical areas,\n      each managed by a technical area director.\
    \  In addition to the\n      IETF Chairman, the area directors make up the IESG\
    \ membership.\n      The IAB has delegated to the IESG the general responsibility\
    \ for\n      making the Internet work and for the resolution of all short- and\n\
    \      mid-range protocol and architectural issues required to make the\n    \
    \  Internet function effectively.\n   What is the IRTF?\n      To promote research\
    \ in networking and the development of new\n      technology, the IAB established\
    \ the Internet Research Task Force\n      (IRTF).\n      In the area of network\
    \ protocols, the distinction between research\n      and engineering is not always\
    \ clear, so there will sometimes be\n      overlap between activities of the IETF\
    \ and the IRTF.  There is, in\n      fact, considerable overlap in membership\
    \ between the two groups.\n      This overlap is regarded as vital for cross-fertilization\
    \ and\n      technology transfer.\n      The IRTF is a community of network researchers,\
    \ generally with an\n      Internet focus.  The work of the IRTF is governed by\
    \ its Internet\n      Research Steering Group (IRSG).  The chairman of the IRTF\
    \ and IRSG\n      is David Clark.\n"

    \ mailbox accessible from the Internet.  First\n      obtain the file NETINFO:USER-TEMPLATE.TXT.\
    \  You can either\n      retrieve this file via anonymous FTP from NIC.DDN.MIL\
    \ or get it\n      through electronic mail.  To obtain the file via electronic\
    \ mail,\n      send a message to SERVICE@NIC.DDN.MIL and put the file name in\
    \ the\n      subject line of the message; that is, \"Subject: NETINFO USER-\n\
    \      TEMPLATE.TXT\".  The file will be returned to you overnight.\n      Fill\
    \ out the name and address information requested in the file\n      and return\
    \ it to REGISTRAR@NIC.DDN.MIL.  Your application will be\n      processed and\
    \ you will be added to the database.  Unless you are\n      an official Point\
    \ of Contact for a network entity registered at\n      the DDN NIC, the DDN NIC\
    \ will not regularly poll you for updates,\n      so you should remember to send\
    \ corrections to your information as\n      your contact data changes.\n   How\
    \ do I use the White Pages at PSI?\n      Performance Systems International, Inc.\
    \ (PSI), sponsors a White\n      Pages Pilot Project that collects personnel information\
    \ from\n      member organizations into a database and provides online access\
    \ to\n      that data.  This effort is based on the OSI X.500 Directory\n    \
    \  standard.\n      To access the data, telnet to WP.PSI.COM and login as \"fred\"\
    \ (no\n      password is necessary).  You may now look up information on\n   \
    \   participating organizations.  The program provides help on usage.\n      For\
    \ example, typing \"help\" will show you a list of commands,\n      \"manual\"\
    \ will give detailed documentation, and \"whois\" will\n      provide information\
    \ regarding how to find references to people.\n      For a list of the organizations\
    \ that are participating in the\n      pilot project by providing information\

    \ send a message to INFO@PSI.COM.\n   What is Usenet?  What is Netnews?\n    \
    \  Usenet and Netnews are common names of a distributed computer\n      bulletin\
    \ board system that some computers on the Internet\n      participate in.  It\
    \ is not strictly an Internet service: many\n      computers not on the Internet\
    \ also participate.\n   How do I get on Usenet?  How do I get Netnews on my computer?\n\
    \      To get on Usenet, you must acquire the software, which is\n      available\
    \ for some computers at no cost from some anonymous ftp\n      sites across the\
    \ Internet, and you must find an existing Usenet\n      site that is willing to\
    \ support a connection to your computer.\n   What is anonymous FTP?\n      Anonymous\
    \ FTP is a conventional way of allowing you to sign on to\n      a computer on\
    \ the Internet and copy specified public files from it\n      [3].  Some sites\
    \ offer anonymous FTP to distribute software and\n      various kinds of information.\
    \  You use it like any FTP, but the\n      username is \"anonymous\" and the password\
    \ is \"guest\".\n"

    \ protocols.  Often referred\n           to simply as OSPF.\n   packet  The unit\
    \ of data sent across a packet switching network.\n           The term is used\
    \ loosely.  While some Internet\n           literature uses it to refer specifically\
    \ to data sent\n           across a physical network, other literature views\n\

    \ details of\n           machine-to-machine interfaces (e.g., the order in\n \
    \          which bits and bytes are sent across a wire)\n           or high-level\
    \ exchanges between allocation\n           programs (e.g., the way in which two\

    \ jobs and\n           retrieving the results.\n   RLOGIN  Remote Login\n    \
    \       A service on internets very similar to TELNET.   RLOGIN was\n        \
    \   invented for use between Berkeley Unix systems on the same\n           LAN\
    \ at a time when TELNET programs didn't provide all the\n           services users\
    \ wanted.   Berkeley plans to phase it out.\n   RPC     Remote Procedure Call\n\
    \           An easy and popular paradigm for implementing the\n           client-server\
    \ model of distributed computing.\n   server  A computer that shares its resources,\
    \ such as printers\n           and files, with other computers on the network.\
    \  An\n           example of this is a Network Files System (NFS)\n          \
    \ Server which shares its disk space with a workstations\n           that does\
    \ not have a disk drive of its own.\n   SESQUINET\n           Sesquicentennial\

    \ data communications protocol.\n   subnet  A portion of a network, which may\
    \ be a physically independent\n           network, which shares a network address\
    \ with other portions\n           of the network and is distinguished by a subnet\
    \ number.  A\n           subnet is to a network what a network is to an internet.\n\
    \   subnet number\n           A part of the internet address which designates\
    \ a subnet.\n           It is ignored for the purposes internet routing, but is\n\

    \ by US Sprint.\n   Telnet  The Internet standard protocol for remote terminal\n\
    \           connection service.  Telnet allows a user at one site\n          \
    \ to interact with a remote timesharing system at\n           another site as\
    \ if the user's terminal was connected\n           directly to the remote computer.\n\
    \   Token Ring\n           A type of LAN.   Examples are IEEE 802.5, ProNET-10/80\
