  - "1.  Introduction\n   This document defines an IPv6 unicast address format that\
    \ is globally\n   unique and is intended for local communications [IPV6].  These\n\
    \   addresses are called Unique Local IPv6 Unicast Addresses and are\n   abbreviated\
    \ in this document as Local IPv6 addresses.  They are not\n   expected to be routable\
    \ on the global Internet.  They are routable\n   inside of a more limited area\
    \ such as a site.  They may also be\n   routed between a limited set of sites.\n\
    \   Local IPv6 unicast addresses have the following characteristics:\n      -\
    \ Globally unique prefix (with high probability of uniqueness).\n      - Well-known\
    \ prefix to allow for easy filtering at site\n        boundaries.\n      - Allow\
    \ sites to be combined or privately interconnected without\n        creating any\
    \ address conflicts or requiring renumbering of\n        interfaces that use these\
    \ prefixes.\n      - Internet Service Provider independent and can be used for\n\
    \        communications inside of a site without having any permanent or\n   \
    \     intermittent Internet connectivity.\n      - If accidentally leaked outside\
    \ of a site via routing or DNS,\n        there is no conflict with any other addresses.\n\
    \      - In practice, applications may treat these addresses like global\n   \
    \     scoped addresses.\n   This document defines the format of Local IPv6 addresses,\
    \ how to\n   allocate them, and usage considerations including routing, site\n\
    \   border routers, DNS, application support, VPN usage, and guidelines\n   for\
    \ how to use for local communication inside a site.\n   The key words \"MUST\"\
    , \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD\
    \ NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n   document are to\
    \ be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].\n"

- title: 3.1.1.  Background
  contents:
  - "3.1.1.  Background\n   There were a range of choices available when choosing\
    \ the size of the\n   prefix and Global ID field length.  There is a direct tradeoff\n\
    \   between having a Global ID field large enough to support foreseeable\n   future\
    \ growth and not using too much of the IPv6 address space\n   needlessly.  A reasonable\
    \ way of evaluating a specific field length\n   is to compare it to a projected\
    \ 2050 world population of 9.3 billion\n   [POPUL] and the number of resulting\
    \ /48 prefixes per person.  A range\n   of prefix choices is shown in the following\
    \ table:\n    Prefix  Global ID     Number of          Prefixes    % of IPv6\n\
    \            Length        /48 Prefixes       per Person  Address Space\n    /11\

    \ utilization ratio of these allocations can be assumed\n   because the Global\
    \ ID field does not require internal structure, and\n   there is no reason to\
    \ be able to aggregate the prefixes.\n   The authors believe that a /7 prefix\
    \ resulting in a 41-bit Global ID\n   space (including the L bit) is a good choice.\
    \  It provides for a\n   large number of assignments (i.e., 2.2 trillion) and\
    \ at the same time\n   uses less than .8% of the total IPv6 address space.  It\
    \ is unlikely\n   that this space will be exhausted.  If more than this were to\
    \ be\n   needed, then additional IPv6 address space could be allocated for\n \
    \  this purpose.\n"
- title: 3.2.  Global ID
  contents:
  - "3.2.  Global ID\n   The allocation of Global IDs is pseudo-random [RANDOM]. \
    \ They MUST\n   NOT be assigned sequentially or with well-known numbers.  This\
    \ is to\n   ensure that there is not any relationship between allocations and\
    \ to\n   help clarify that these prefixes are not intended to be routed\n   globally.\
    \  Specifically, these prefixes are not designed to\n   aggregate.\n   This document\
    \ defines a specific local method to allocate Global IDs,\n   indicated by setting\
    \ the L bit to 1.  Another method, indicated by\n   clearing the L bit, may be\
    \ defined later.  Apart from the allocation\n   method, all Local IPv6 addresses\
    \ behave and are treated identically.\n   The local assignments are self-generated\
    \ and do not need any central\n   coordination or assignment, but have an extremely\
    \ high probability of\n   being unique.\n"

    \ describes a\n   suggested algorithm.  It is important that all sites generating\n\
    \   Global IDs use a functionally similar algorithm to ensure there is a\n   high\
    \ probability of uniqueness.\n   The use of a pseudo-random algorithm to generate\
    \ Global IDs in the\n   locally assigned prefix gives an assurance that any network\
    \ numbered\n   using such a prefix is highly unlikely to have that address space\n\
    \   clash with any other network that has another locally assigned prefix\n  \
    \ allocated to it.  This is a particularly useful property when\n   considering\

  contents:
  - "3.2.3.  Analysis of the Uniqueness of Global IDs\n   The selection of a pseudo\
    \ random Global ID is similar to the\n   selection of an SSRC identifier in RTP/RTCP\
    \ defined in Section 8.1 of\n   [RTP].  This analysis is adapted from that document.\n\
    \   Since Global IDs are chosen randomly (and independently), it is\n   possible\
    \ that separate networks have chosen the same Global ID.  For\n   any given network,\
    \ with one or more random Global IDs, that has\n   inter-connections to other\
    \ such networks, having a total of N such\n   IDs, the probability that two or\
    \ more of these IDs will collide can\n   be approximated using the formula:\n\
    \      P = 1 - exp(-N**2 / 2**(L+1))\n   where P is the probability of collision,\
    \ N is the number of\n   interconnected Global IDs, and L is the length of the\
    \ Global ID.\n   The following table shows the probability of a collision for\
    \ a range\n   of connections using a 40-bit Global ID field.\n      Connections\

    \ site in\n   the same manner as other types of unicast addresses.  They can be\n\
    \   carried in any IPv6 routing protocol without any change.\n   It is expected\
    \ that they would share the same Subnet IDs with\n   provider-based global unicast\
    \ addresses, if they were being used\n   concurrently [GLOBAL].\n   The default\
    \ behavior of exterior routing protocol sessions between\n   administrative routing\
    \ regions must be to ignore receipt of and not\n   advertise prefixes in the FC00::/7\
    \ block.  A network operator may\n   specifically configure prefixes longer than\
    \ FC00::/7 for inter-site\n   communication.\n   If BGP is being used at the site\
    \ border with an ISP, the default BGP\n   configuration must filter out any Local\
    \ IPv6 address prefixes, both\n   incoming and outgoing.  It must be set both\
    \ to keep any Local IPv6\n   address prefixes from being advertised outside of\
    \ the site as well as\n   to keep these prefixes from being learned from another\
    \ site.  The\n   exception to this is if there are specific /48 or longer routes\n\

  contents:
  - "4.4.  DNS Issues\n   At the present time, AAAA and PTR records for locally assigned\
    \ local\n   IPv6 addresses are not recommended to be installed in the global DNS.\n\
    \   For background on this recommendation, one of the concerns about\n   adding\
    \ AAAA and PTR records to the global DNS for locally assigned\n   Local IPv6 addresses\
    \ stems from the lack of complete assurance that\n   the prefixes are unique.\
    \  There is a small possibility that the same\n   locally assigned IPv6 Local\
    \ addresses will be used by two different\n   organizations both claiming to be\
    \ authoritative with different\n   contents.  In this scenario, it is likely there\
    \ will be a connection\n   attempt to the closest host with the corresponding\
    \ locally assigned\n   IPv6 Local address.  This may result in connection timeouts,\n\
    \   connection failures indicated by ICMP Destination Unreachable\n   messages,\
    \ or successful connections to the wrong host.  Due to this\n   concern, adding\
    \ AAAA records for these addresses to the global DNS is\n   thought to be unwise.\n\
    \   Reverse (address-to-name) queries for locally assigned IPv6 Local\n   addresses\
    \ MUST NOT be sent to name servers for the global DNS, due to\n   the load that\
    \ such queries would create for the authoritative name\n   servers for the ip6.arpa\
    \ zone.  This form of query load is not\n   specific to locally assigned Local\
    \ IPv6 addresses; any current form\n   of local addressing creates additional\
    \ load of this kind, due to\n   reverse queries leaking out of the site.  However,\
    \ since allowing\n   such queries to escape from the site serves no useful purpose,\
    \ there\n   is no good reason to make the existing load problems worse.\n   The\
    \ recommended way to avoid sending such queries to nameservers for\n   the global\
    \ DNS is for recursive name server implementations to act as\n   if they were\
    \ authoritative for an empty d.f.ip6.arpa zone and return\n   RCODE 3 for any\
    \ such query.  Implementations that choose this\n   strategy should allow it to\
    \ be overridden, but returning an RCODE 3\n   response for such queries should\
    \ be the default, both because this\n   will reduce the query load problem and\
    \ also because, if the site\n   administrator has not set up the reverse tree\
    \ corresponding to the\n   locally assigned IPv6 Local addresses in use, returning\
    \ RCODE 3 is in\n   fact the correct answer.\n"
- title: 4.5.  Application and Higher Level Protocol Issues
  contents:
  - "4.5.  Application and Higher Level Protocol Issues\n   Application and other\
    \ higher level protocols can treat Local IPv6\n   addresses in the same manner\
    \ as other types of global unicast\n   addresses.  No special handling is required.\
    \  This type of address\n   may not be reachable, but that is no different from\
    \ other types of\n   IPv6 global unicast address.  Applications need to be able\
    \ to handle\n   multiple addresses that may or may not be reachable at any point\
    \ in\n   time.  In most cases, this complexity should be hidden in APIs.\n   From\
    \ a host's perspective, the difference between Local IPv6 and\n   other types\
    \ of global unicast addresses shows up as different\n   reachability and could\
    \ be handled by default in that way.  In some\n   cases, it is better for nodes\
    \ and applications to treat them\n   differently from global unicast addresses.\
    \  A starting point might be\n   to give them preference over global unicast,\
    \ but fall back to global\n   unicast if a particular destination is found to\
    \ be unreachable.  Much\n   of this behavior can be controlled by how they are\

  - "4.6.  Use of Local IPv6 Addresses for Local Communication\n   Local IPv6 addresses,\
    \ like global scope unicast addresses, are only\n   assigned to nodes if their\
    \ use has been enabled (via IPv6 address\n   autoconfiguration [ADDAUTO], DHCPv6\
    \ [DHCP6], or manually).  They are\n   not created automatically in the way that\
    \ IPv6 link-local addresses\n   are and will not appear or be used unless they\
    \ are purposely\n   configured.\n   In order for hosts to autoconfigure Local\
    \ IPv6 addresses, routers\n   have to be configured to advertise Local IPv6 /64\
    \ prefixes in router\n   advertisements, or a DHCPv6 server must have been configured\
    \ to\n   assign them.  In order for a node to learn the Local IPv6 address of\n\
    \   another node, the Local IPv6 address must have been installed in a\n   naming\
    \ system (e.g., DNS, proprietary naming system, etc.)  For these\n   reasons,\
    \ controlling their usage in a site is straightforward.\n   To limit the use of\
    \ Local IPv6 addresses the following guidelines\n   apply:\n      - Nodes that\
    \ are to only be reachable inside of a site:  The local\n        DNS should be\
    \ configured to only include the Local IPv6\n        addresses of these nodes.\
    \  Nodes with only Local IPv6 addresses\n        must not be installed in the\
    \ global DNS.\n      - Nodes that are to be limited to only communicate with other\n\
    \        nodes in the site:  These nodes should be set to only\n        autoconfigure\
    \ Local IPv6 addresses via [ADDAUTO] or to only\n        receive Local IPv6 addresses\
    \ via [DHCP6].  Note: For the case\n        where both global and Local IPv6 prefixes\
    \ are being advertised\n        on a subnet, this will require a switch in the\
    \ devices to only\n        autoconfigure Local IPv6 addresses.\n      - Nodes\
    \ that are to be reachable from inside of the site and from\n        outside of\
    \ the site:  The DNS should be configured to include\n        the global addresses\
    \ of these nodes.  The local DNS may be\n        configured to also include the\
    \ Local IPv6 addresses of these\n        nodes.\n      - Nodes that can communicate\
    \ with other nodes inside of the site\n        and outside of the site: These\
    \ nodes should autoconfigure global\n        addresses via [ADDAUTO] or receive\
    \ global address via [DHCP6].\n        They may also obtain Local IPv6 addresses\
    \ via the same\n        mechanisms.\n"

    \ for inter-site Virtual Private\n   Networks (VPN) if appropriate routes are\
    \ set up.  Because the\n   addresses are unique, these VPNs will work reliably\
    \ and without the\n   need for translation.  They have the additional property\
    \ that they\n   will continue to work if the individual sites are renumbered or\n\
    \   merged.\n"

  contents:
  - "5.  Global Routing Considerations\n   Section 4.1 provides operational guidelines\
    \ that forbid default\n   routing of local addresses between sites.  Concerns\
    \ were raised to\n   the IPv6 working group and to the IETF as a whole that sites\
    \ may\n   attempt to use local addresses as globally routed provider-\n   independent\
    \ addresses.  This section describes why using local\n   addresses as globally-routed\
    \ provider-independent addresses is\n   unadvisable.\n"
- title: 5.1.  From the Standpoint of the Internet
  contents:
  - "5.1.  From the Standpoint of the Internet\n   There is a mismatch between the\
    \ structure of IPv6 local addresses and\n   the normal IPv6 wide area routing\
    \ model.  The /48 prefix of an IPv6\n   local addresses fits nowhere in the normal\
    \ hierarchy of IPv6 unicast\n   addresses.  Normal IPv6 unicast addresses can\
    \ be routed\n   hierarchically down to physical subnet (link) level and only have\
    \ to\n   be flat-routed on the physical subnet.  IPv6 local addresses would\n\
    \   have to be flat-routed even over the wide area Internet.\n   Thus, packets\
    \ whose destination address is an IPv6 local address\n   could be routed over\
    \ the wide area only if the corresponding /48\n   prefix were carried by the wide\
    \ area routing protocol in use, such as\n   BGP.  This contravenes the operational\
    \ assumption that long prefixes\n   will be aggregated into many fewer short prefixes,\
    \ to limit the table\n   size and convergence time of the routing protocol.  If\
    \ a network uses\n   both normal IPv6 addresses [ADDARCH] and IPv6 local addresses,\
    \ these\n   types of addresses will certainly not aggregate with each other,\n\
    \   since they differ from the most significant bit onwards.  Neither\n   will\
    \ IPv6 local addresses aggregate with each other, due to their\n   random bit\
    \ patterns.  This means that there would be a very\n   significant operational\
    \ penalty for attempting to use IPv6 local\n   address prefixes generically with\
    \ currently known wide area routing\n   technology.\n"
- title: 5.2.  From the Standpoint of a Site
  contents:
  - "5.2.  From the Standpoint of a Site\n   There are a number of design factors\
    \ in IPv6 local addresses that\n   reduce the likelihood that IPv6 local addresses\
    \ will be used as\n   arbitrary global unicast addresses.  These include:\n  \
    \    - The default rules to filter packets and routes make it very\n        difficult\
    \ to use IPv6 local addresses for arbitrary use across\n        the Internet.\
    \  For a site to use them as general purpose unicast\n        addresses, it would\
    \ have to make sure that the default rules\n        were not being used by all\
    \ other sites and intermediate ISPs\n        used for their current and future\
    \ communication.\n      - They are not mathematically guaranteed to be unique\
    \ and are not\n        registered in public databases.  Collisions, while highly\n\
    \        unlikely, are possible and a collision can compromise the\n        integrity\
    \ of the communications.  The lack of public\n        registration creates operational\
    \ problems.\n      - The addresses are allocated randomly.  If a site had multiple\n\
    \        prefixes that it wanted to be used globally, the cost of\n        advertising\
    \ them would be very high because they could not be\n        aggregated.\n   \
    \   - They have a long prefix (i.e., /48) so a single local address\n        prefix\
    \ doesn't provide enough address space to be used\n        exclusively by the\
    \ largest organizations.\n"

- title: 6.1.  Advantages
  contents:
  - "6.1.  Advantages\n   This approach has the following advantages:\n      - Provides\
    \ Local IPv6 prefixes that can be used independently of\n        any provider-based\
    \ IPv6 unicast address allocations.  This is\n        useful for sites not always\
    \ connected to the Internet or sites\n        that wish to have a distinct prefix\
    \ that can be used to localize\n        traffic inside of the site.\n      - Applications\
    \ can treat these addresses in an identical manner as\n        any other type\
    \ of global IPv6 unicast addresses.\n      - Sites can be merged without any renumbering\
    \ of the Local IPv6\n        addresses.\n      - Sites can change their provider-based\
    \ IPv6 unicast address\n        without disrupting any communication that uses\
    \ Local IPv6\n        addresses.\n      - Well-known prefix that allows for easy\
    \ filtering at site\n        boundary.\n      - Can be used for inter-site VPNs.\n\
    \      - If accidently leaked outside of a site via routing or DNS, there\n  \
    \      is no conflict with any other addresses.\n"
- title: 6.2.  Disadvantages
  contents:
  - "6.2.  Disadvantages\n   This approach has the following disadvantages:\n    \
    \  - Not possible to route Local IPv6 prefixes on the global Internet\n      \
    \  with current routing technology.  Consequentially, it is\n        necessary\
    \ to have the default behavior of site border routers to\n        filter these\
    \ addresses.\n      - There is a very low probability of non-unique locally assigned\n\
    \        Global IDs being generated by the algorithm in Section 3.2.3.\n     \
    \   This risk can be ignored for all practical purposes, but it\n        leads\
    \ to a theoretical risk of clashing address prefixes.\n"
- title: 7.  Security Considerations

  - "7.  Security Considerations\n   Local IPv6 addresses do not provide any inherent\
    \ security to the\n   nodes that use them.  They may be used with filters at site\n\
    \   boundaries to keep Local IPv6 traffic inside of the site, but this is\n  \
    \ no more or less secure than filtering any other type of global IPv6\n   unicast\
