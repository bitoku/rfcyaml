- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   The MPLS Transport Profile (MPLS-TP) is described in [RFC5921].\n\
    \   [RFC6372] provides a survivability framework for MPLS-TP and is the\n   foundation\
    \ for this document.\n   Terminology for recovery of connectivity in networks\
    \ is provided in\n   [RFC4427] and includes the concept of surviving network faults\n\
    \   (survivability) through the use of re-established connections\n   (restoration)\
    \ and switching of traffic to pre-established backup\n   paths (protection). \
    \ MPLS provides control-plane tools to support\n   various survivability schemes,\
    \ some of which are identified in\n   [RFC4426].  In addition, recent efforts\
    \ in the IETF have started\n   providing for data-plane tools to address aspects\
    \ of data protection.\n   In particular, [RFC6378] and [RFC7271] define a set\
    \ of triggers and\n   coordination protocols for 1:1 and 1+1 linear protection\
    \ of point-to-\n   point paths.\n   When considering a full-mesh network and the\
    \ protection of different\n   paths that traverse the mesh, it is possible to\
    \ provide an acceptable\n   level of protection while conserving the amount of\
    \ protection\n   resources needed to protect the different data paths.  As pointed\
    \ out\n   in [RFC6372] and [RFC4427], applying 1+1 protection requires that\n\
    \   resources are allocated for use by both the working and protection\n   paths.\
    \  Applying 1:1 protection requires that the same resources are\n   allocated\
    \ but allows the resources of the protection path to be\n   utilized for preemptible\
    \ extra traffic.  Extending this to 1:n or m:n\n   protection allows the resources\
    \ of the protection path to be shared\n   in the protection of several working\
    \ paths.  However, 1:n or m:n\n   protection architecture is limited by the restriction\
    \ that all of the\n   n+1 or m+n paths must have the same endpoints.  m:n protection\n\
    \   architecture provides m protection paths to protect n working paths,\n   where\
    \ m or n can be 1.\n   This document provides requirements for any mechanism that\
    \ would be\n   used to implement SMP for MPLS-TP data paths, in networks that\n\
    \   delegate protection switch coordination to the data plane.\n"

  - "3.  Shared Mesh Protection Reference Model\n   As described in [RFC6372], SMP\
    \ supports the sharing of protection\n   resources, while providing protection\
    \ for multiple working paths that\n   need not have common endpoints and do not\
    \ share common points of\n   failure.  Note that some protection resources may\
    \ be shared, while\n   some others may not be.  An example of data paths that\
    \ employ SMP is\n   shown in Figure 1.  It shows two working paths -- <ABCDE>\
    \ and <VWXYZ>\n   -- that are protected employing 1:1 linear protection by protection\n\
    \   paths <APQRE> and <VPQRZ>, respectively.  The two protection paths\n   that\

    \   objectives and a framework for applying SMP within an MPLS network,\n   without\
    \ the use of control-plane protocols.  Although there are\n   existing control-plane\
    \ solutions for SMP within MPLS, a data-plane\n   solution is required for networks\

    \          Figure 2: Example of a Larger SMP Architecture\n   Consider the network\
    \ presented in Figure 2.  There are five working\n   paths:\n      -  <ABCDE>\n\
    \      -  <MDEN>\n      -  <FGH>\n      -  <JKL>\n      -  <VWXYZ>\n   Each of\
    \ these has a corresponding protection path:\n      -  <APQRE> (p1)\n      - \
    \ <MSTN> (p2)\n      -  <FPQH> (p3)\n      -  <JRSL> (p4)\n      -  <VPQRSTZ>\
    \ (p5)\n   The following segments are shared by two or more of the protection\n\
    \   paths -- <PQ> is shared by p1, p3, and p5; <QR> is shared by p1 and\n   p5;\
    \ <RS> is shared by p4 and p5; and <ST> is shared by p2 and p5.  In\n   Figure\
    \ 2, we have the following SMP Protection Groups -- {p1, p3, p5}\n   for <PQ>,\
    \ {p1, p5} for <QR>, {p4, p5} for <RS>, and {p2, p5}\n   for <ST>.\n   We assume\
    \ that the available protection resources for these shared\n   segments are not\
    \ sufficient to support the complete traffic capacity\n   of the respective working\
    \ paths that may use the protection paths.\n   We can further observe that with\
    \ a method of coordinating sharing and\n   preemption, there are no co-routing\
    \ constraints on shared components\n   at the segment level.\n   The use of preemption\
    \ in the network is typically a business or\n   policy decision such that when\
    \ protection resources are contested,\n   priority can be applied to determine\
    \ which parties utilize the\n   protection resources.\n   As opposed to the case\
    \ of simple linear protection, where the\n   relationship between the working\
    \ and protection paths is defined and\n   the resources for the protection path\
    \ are fully dedicated, the\n   protection path in the case of SMP consists of\
    \ segments that are used\n   for the protection of the related working path and\
    \ also segments that\n   are shared with other protection paths such that typically\
    \ the\n   protection resources are oversubscribed to support working paths that\n\
    \   do not share common points of failure.  What is required is a\n   preemption\
    \ mechanism to implement business priority when multiple\n   failure scenarios\
    \ occur.  As such, the protection resources may be\n   allocated but would not\
    \ be utilized until requested and resolved in\n   relation to other members of\
    \ the SMP Protection Group as part of a\n   protection switchover.\n   [RFC6372]\
    \ defines two types of preemption that can be considered for\n   how the resources\
    \ of SMP Protection Groups are shared: \"soft\n   preemption\", where traffic\
    \ of lower-priority paths is degraded; and\n   \"hard preemption\", where traffic\
    \ of lower-priority paths is\n   completely blocked.  The traffic of lower-priority\
    \ paths in this\n   document can be viewed as the extra traffic being preempted,\
    \ as\n   described in [RFC6372].  \"Hard preemption\" requires the programming\n\
    \   of selectors at the ingress of each shared segment to specify the\n   priorities\
    \ of backup paths, so that traffic of lower-priority paths\n   can be preempted.\
    \  When any protection mechanism where the protection\n   endpoint may have a\
    \ choice of protection paths (e.g., m:n or m:1) is\n   deployed, the shared segment\
    \ selectors require coordination with the\n   protection endpoints as well.\n\
    \   Typical deployment of services that use SMP requires various network\n   planning\
    \ activities.  These include the following:\n   o  Determining the number of working\
    \ and protection paths required to\n      achieve resiliency targets for the service.\n\
    \   o  Reviewing network topology to determine which working or\n      protection\
    \ paths are required to be disjoint from each other, and\n      excluding specified\
    \ resources such as links, nodes, or shared risk\n      link groups (SRLGs).\n\
    \   o  Determining the size (bandwidth) of the shared resource.\n"
- title: 4.1.  Coordination of Resources
  contents:
  - "4.1.  Coordination of Resources\n   When a protection switch is triggered, the\
    \ SMP network performs two\n   operations -- switching data traffic over to a\
    \ protection path and\n   coordinating the utilization of the associated shared\
    \ resources.\n   Both operations should occur at the same time, or as close together\n\
    \   as possible, to provide fast protection.  The resource utilization\n   coordination\
    \ is dependent upon their availability at each of the\n   shared segments.\n \
    \  When the reserved resources of the shared segments are utilized by a\n   particular\
    \ protection path, there may not be sufficient resources\n   available for an\
    \ additional protection path.  This then implies that\n   if another working path\
    \ of the SMP domain triggers a protection\n   switch, the resource utilization\

    \ suggested\n   that this be carried out under the control of a dynamic control\

    \ under the control of a\n   control plane or for other reasons have delegated\
    \ executive action\n   for resilience to the data plane, and require the ability\

    \ shared segments have been successfully utilized\n      by a protection path,\
    \ the traffic on that protection path SHALL\n      NOT be interrupted by any protection\
    \ traffic whose priority is\n      equal to or lower than the protecting path\
    \ currently in use.\n   6. During preemption, shared segment resources MAY be\
    \ used by both\n      existing traffic (that is being preempted) and higher-priority\n\
    \      traffic.\n"
- title: 5.3.  Notification
  contents:
  - "5.3.  Notification\n   When a working path endpoint has a protection switch triggered,\
    \ it\n   SHOULD attempt to switch the traffic to the protection path and\n   request\
    \ the coordination of the shared resource utilization.  If the\n   necessary shared\
    \ resources are unavailable, the endpoints of the\n   requesting working path\
    \ SHALL be notified of protection switchover\n   failure, and switchover will\
    \ not be completed.\n   Similarly, if preemption is supported and the resources\
    \ currently\n   utilized by a particular working path are being preempted, then\
    \ the\n   endpoints of the affected working path whose traffic is being\n   preempted\
    \ SHALL be notified that the resources are being preempted.\n   As described in\
    \ [RFC6372], the event of preemption may be detected by\n   Operations, Administration,\
    \ and Maintenance (OAM) and reported as a\n   fault or a degradation of traffic\
    \ delivery.\n"
- title: 5.4.  Reversion
  contents:
  - "5.4.  Reversion\n   When the condition that triggered the protection switch is\
    \ cleared,\n   it is possible to either revert to using the working path resources\n\
    \   or continue to utilize the protection resources.  Continuing the use\n   of\
    \ protection resources allows the operator to delay the disruption\n   of service\
    \ caused by the switchover until periods of lighter traffic.\n   The switchover\
    \ would need to be performed via an explicit operator\n   command, unless the\
    \ protection resources are preempted by a higher-\n   priority fault.  Hence,\
    \ both automatic and manual revertive behaviors\n   MUST be supported for hard\
    \ preemption in an SMP domain.  Normally,\n   the network should revert to use\
    \ of the working path resources in\n   order to clear the protection resources\
    \ for protection of other path\n   triggers.  However, the protocol MUST support\
    \ non-revertive\n   configurations.\n"
- title: 5.5.  Protection Switching Time
  contents:
  - "5.5.  Protection Switching Time\n   Protection switching time refers to the transfer\
    \ time (Tt) defined in\n   [G.808.1] and recovery switching time defined in [RFC4427],\
    \ and is\n   defined as the interval after a switching trigger is identified until\n\
    \   the traffic begins to be transmitted on the protection path.  This\n   time\
    \ does not include the time needed to initiate the protection\n   switching process\
    \ after a failure occurred, and the time needed to\n   complete preemption of\
    \ existing traffic on the shared segments as\n   described in Section 4.2.  The\
    \ time needed to initiate the protection\n   switching process, which is known\
    \ as detection time or correlation\n   time in [RFC4427], is related to the OAM\
    \ or management process, but\n   the time needed to complete preemption is related\
    \ to the actions\n   within an SMP domain.  Support for a protection switching\
    \ time of\n   50 ms is dependent upon the initial switchover to the protection\n\
    \   path, but the preemption time SHOULD also be taken into account to\n   minimize\
    \ total service interruption time.\n   When triggered, protection switching action\
    \ SHOULD be initiated\n   immediately to minimize service interruption time.\n"
- title: 5.6.  Timers
  contents:
  - "5.6.  Timers\n   In order to prevent multiple switching actions for a single\
    \ switching\n   trigger, when there are multiple layers of networks, SMP SHOULD\
    \ be\n   controlled by a hold-off timer that would allow lower-layer\n   mechanisms\
    \ to complete their switching actions before invoking SMP\n   protection actions\
    \ as described in [RFC6372].\n   In order to prevent an unstable recovering working\
    \ path from invoking\n   intermittent switching operations, SMP SHOULD employ\
    \ a\n   Wait-To-Restore timer during any reversion switching, as described in\n\
    \   [RFC6372].\n"
- title: 5.7.  Communication Channel and Fate-Sharing
  contents:
  - "5.7.  Communication Channel and Fate-Sharing\n   SMP SHOULD provide a communication\
    \ channel, along the protection\n   path, between the endpoints of the protection\
    \ path, to support fast\n   protection switching.\n   SMP in hard-preemption mode\
    \ SHOULD include support for communicating\n   information to coordinate the use\
    \ of the shared protection resources\n   among multiple working paths.  The message\
    \ encoding and communication\n   channel between the nodes of the shared protection\
    \ resource and the\n   endpoints of the protection path are out of the scope of\
    \ this\n   document.\n   Bidirectional protection switching SHOULD be supported\
    \ in SMP.\n"
- title: 6.  Manageability Considerations
  contents:
  - "6.  Manageability Considerations\n   The network management architecture and\
    \ requirements for MPLS-TP are\n   specified in [RFC5951].  They derive from the\
    \ generic specifications\n   described in ITU-T G.7710/Y.1701 [G.7710] for transport\
    \ technologies.\n   This document does not introduce any new manageability requirements\n\
    \   beyond those covered in those documents.\n"
- title: 7.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "7.  Security Considerations\n   General security considerations for MPLS-TP are\
    \ covered in [RFC5921].\n   The security considerations for the generic associated\
    \ control\n   channel are described in [RFC5586].\n   Security considerations\
    \ for any proposed solution should consider\n   exhaustion of resources related\
    \ to preemption, especially by a\n   malicious actor as a threat vector against\
    \ which the resources should\n   be protected.  Protections should also be considered\
    \ to prevent a\n   malicious actor from attempting to create an alternate path\
    \ on which\n   to force traffic from a sensor/device, thereby enabling pervasive\n\
    \   monitoring [RFC7258].\n"
