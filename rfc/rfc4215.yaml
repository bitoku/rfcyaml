    \ to\n   IPv6 in Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) General Packet\n\
    \   Radio Service (GPRS) packet networks [3GPP-23.060], in which the\n   radio\
    \ network architecture is based on Global System for Mobile\n   Communications\
    \ (GSM) or Universal Mobile Telecommunications System\n   (UMTS)/Wideband Code\
    \ Division Multiple Access (WCDMA) technology.\n   This document analyzes the\
    \ transition scenarios that may come up in\n   the deployment phase of IPv6 in\
    \ 3GPP packet data networks.\n   The 3GPP network architecture is described in\
    \ [RFC3314], and relevant\n   transition scenarios are documented in [RFC3574].\
    \  The reader of this\n   specification should be familiar with the material presented\
    \ in these\n   documents.\n   The scenarios analyzed in this document are divided\
    \ into two\n   categories: general-purpose packet service scenarios, referred\
    \ to as\n   GPRS scenarios in this document, and IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS)\n\
    \   scenarios, which include Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)\n   considerations.\
    \  For more information about IMS, see [3GPP-23.228],\n   [3GPP-24.228], and [3GPP-24.229].\n\
    \   GPRS scenarios are the following:\n      - Dual Stack User Equipment (UE)\
    \ connecting to IPv4 and IPv6 nodes\n      - IPv6 UE connecting to an IPv6 node\
    \ through an IPv4 network\n      - IPv4 UE connecting to an IPv4 node through\
    \ an IPv6 network\n      - IPv6 UE connecting to an IPv4 node\n      - IPv4 UE\

    \ connecting to a node in an IPv4 network through IMS\n      - Two IPv6 IMS connected\
    \ via an IPv4 network\n   The focus is on analyzing different transition scenarios\
    \ and\n   applicable transition mechanisms and finding solutions for those\n \
    \  transition scenarios.  In the scenarios, the User Equipment (UE)\n   connects\

    \ document\n   covers scenarios with and without the use of the SIP-based IP\n\
    \   Multimedia Core Network Subsystem (IMS).  This document does not\n   focus\
    \ on radio-interface-specific issues; both 3GPP Second and Third\n   Generation\
    \ radio network architectures (GSM, Enhanced Data rates for\n   GSM Evolution\
    \ (EDGE) and UMTS/WCDMA) will be covered by this\n   analysis.\n   The 3GPP2 architecture\
    \ is similar to 3GPP in many ways, but differs\n   in enough details that this\
    \ document does not include these\n   variations in its analysis.\n   The transition\
    \ mechanisms specified by the IETF Ngtrans and v6ops\n   Working Groups shall\

- title: 3.1.  Dual Stack UE Connecting to IPv4 and IPv6 Nodes
  contents:
  - "3.1.  Dual Stack UE Connecting to IPv4 and IPv6 Nodes\n   In this scenario, the\
    \ dual stack UE is capable of communicating with\n   both IPv4 and IPv6 nodes.\n\
    \   It is recommended to activate an IPv6 PDP context when communicating\n   with\
    \ an IPv6 peer node and an IPv4 PDP context when communicating\n   with an IPv4\
    \ peer node.  If the 3GPP network supports both IPv4 and\n   IPv6 PDP contexts,\
    \ the UE activates the appropriate PDP context\n   depending on the type of application\
    \ it has started or depending on\n   the address of the peer host it needs to\
    \ communicate with.  The\n   authors leave the PDP context activation policy to\
    \ be decided by UE\n   implementers, application developers, and operators.  One\
    \ discussed\n   possibility is to activate both IPv4 and IPv6 types of PDP contexts\n\
    \   in advance, because activation of a PDP context usually takes some\n   time.\
    \  However, that probably is not good usage of network resources.\n   Generally\
    \ speaking, IPv6 PDP contexts should be preferred even if\n   that meant IPv6-in-IPv4\
    \ tunneling would be needed in the network (see\n   Section 3.2 for more details).\
    \  Note that this is transparent to the\n   UE.\n   Although the UE is dual stack,\
    \ the UE may find itself attached to a\n   3GPP network in which the Serving GPRS\
    \ Support Node (SGSN), the GGSN,\n   and the Home Location Register (HLR) support\
    \ IPv4 PDP contexts, but\n   do not support IPv6 PDP contexts.  This may happen\
    \ in early phases of\n   IPv6 deployment, or because the UE has \"roamed\" from\
    \ a 3GPP network\n   that supports IPv6 to one that does not.  If the 3GPP network\
    \ does\n   not support IPv6 PDP contexts, and an application on the UE needs to\n\
    \   communicate with an IPv6(-only) node, the UE may activate an IPv4 PDP\n  \
    \ context and encapsulate IPv6 packets in IPv4 packets using a\n   tunneling mechanism.\n\
    \   The tunneling mechanism may require public IPv4 addresses, but there\n   are\
    \ tunneling mechanisms and deployment scenarios in which private\n   IPv4 addresses\
    \ may be used, for instance, if the tunnel endpoints are\n   in the same private\
    \ domain, or the tunneling mechanism works through\n   IPv4 NAT.\n   One deployment\
    \ scenario uses a laptop computer and a 3GPP UE as a\n   modem.  IPv6 packets\
    \ are encapsulated in IPv4 packets in the laptop\n   computer and an IPv4 PDP\
    \ context is activated.  The tunneling\n   mechanism depends on the laptop computer's\
    \ support of tunneling\n   mechanisms.  Another deployment scenario is performing\
    \ IPv6-in-IPv4\n   tunneling in the UE itself and activating an IPv4 PDP context.\n\
    \   Closer details for an applicable tunneling mechanism are not analyzed\n  \
    \ in this document.  However, a simple host-to-router (automatic)\n   tunneling\
    \ mechanism can be a good fit.  There is not yet consensus on\n   the right approach,\
    \ and proposed mechanisms so far include [ISATAP]\n   and [STEP].  Especially\
    \ ISATAP has had some support in the working\n   group.  Goals for 3GPP zero-configuration\
    \ tunneling are documented in\n   [zeroconf].\n   This document strongly recommends\
    \ that the 3GPP operators deploy\n   basic IPv6 support in their GPRS networks.\
    \  That makes it possible to\n   lessen the transition effects in the UEs.\n \
    \  As a general guideline, IPv6 communication is preferred to IPv4\n   communication\
    \ going through IPv4 NATs to the same dual stack peer\n   node.\n   Public IPv4\
    \ addresses are often a scarce resource for the operator,\n   and usually it is\
    \ not possible for a UE to have a public IPv4 address\n   (continuously) allocated\
    \ for its use.  Use of private IPv4 addresses\n   means use of NATs when communicating\
    \ with a peer node outside the\n   operator's network.  In large networks, NAT\
    \ systems can become very\n   complex, expensive, and difficult to maintain.\n"

  contents:
  - "3.2.  IPv6 UE Connecting to an IPv6 Node through an IPv4 Network\n   The best\
    \ solution for this scenario is obtained with tunneling; i.e.,\n   IPv6-in-IPv4\
    \ tunneling is a requirement.  An IPv6 PDP context is\n   activated between the\
    \ UE and the GGSN.  Tunneling is handled in the\n   network, because IPv6 UE does\
    \ not have the dual stack functionality\n   needed for tunneling.  The encapsulating\
    \ node can be the GGSN, the\n   edge router between the border of the operator's\
    \ IPv6 network and the\n   public Internet, or any other dual stack node within\
    \ the operator's\n   IP network.  The encapsulation (uplink) and decapsulation\
    \ (downlink)\n   can be handled by the same network element.  Typically, the tunneling\n\
    \   handled by the network elements is transparent to the UEs and IP\n   traffic\
    \ looks like native IPv6 traffic to them.  For the applications\n   and transport\
    \ protocols, tunneling enables end-to-end IPv6\n   connectivity.\n   IPv6-in-IPv4\

    \ of the type of tunneling mechanism is a\n   policy decision for the operator/ISP\
    \ deployment scenario, and only\n   generic recommendations can be given in this\
    \ document.\n   The following subsections are focused on the usage of different\n\
    \   tunneling mechanisms when the peer node is in the operator's network\n   or\
    \ outside the operator's network.  The authors note that where the\n   actual\
    \ 3GPP network ends and which parts of the network belong to the\n   ISP(s) also\
    \ depend on the deployment scenario.  The authors are not\n   commenting on how\
    \ many ISP functions the 3GPP operator should\n   perform.  However, many 3GPP\
    \ operators are ISPs of some sort\n   themselves.  ISP networks' transition to\

  contents:
  - "3.2.1.  Tunneling Inside the 3GPP Operator's Network\n   GPRS operators today\
    \ have typically deployed IPv4 backbone networks.\n   IPv6 backbones can be considered\
    \ quite rare in the first phases of\n   the transition.\n   In initial IPv6 deployment,\
    \ where a small number of IPv6-in-IPv4\n   tunnels are required to connect the\
    \ IPv6 islands over the 3GPP\n   operator's IPv4 network, manually configured\
    \ tunnels can be used.  In\n   a 3GPP network, one IPv6 island can contain the\
    \ GGSN while another\n   island can contain the operator's IPv6 application servers.\
    \  However,\n   manually configured tunnels can be an administrative burden when\
    \ the\n   number of islands and therefore tunnels rises.  In that case,\n   upgrading\
    \ parts of the backbone to dual stack may be the simplest\n   choice.  The administrative\
    \ burden could also be mitigated by using\n   automated management tools.\n  \
    \ Connection redundancy should also be noted as an important\n   requirement in\
    \ 3GPP networks.  Static tunnels alone do not provide a\n   routing recovery solution\
    \ for all scenarios where an IPv6 route goes\n   down.  However, they can provide\
    \ an adequate solution depending on\n   the design of the network and the presence\

    \ the case in which the peer node is outside\n   the operator's network.  In that\

    \ and reach other IPv6 nodes.  In\n   general, configured tunneling can be recommended.\n\
    \   Tunnel starting point can be in the operator's network depending on\n   how\
    \ far the 3GPP operator has come in implementing IPv6.  If the 3GPP\n   operator\
    \ has not deployed IPv6 in its backbone, the encapsulating\n   node can be the\

    \ useful to split the end-to-end IPv4 UE to\n   IPv4 node communication into UE-to-GGSN\
    \ and GGSN-to-v4NODE.  This\n   allows an IPv4-only UE to use an IPv4 link (an\
    \ IPv4 PDP context) to\n   connect to the GGSN without communicating over an IPv6\
    \ network.\n   Regarding the GGSN-to-v4NODE communication, typically the transport\n\
    \   network between the GGSN and external networks will support only IPv4\n  \
    \ in the early stages and migrate to dual stack, since these networks\n   are\
    \ already deployed.  Therefore, it is not envisaged that tunneling\n   of IPv4-in-IPv6\
    \ will be required from the GGSN to external IPv4\n   networks either.  In the\
    \ longer run, 3GPP operators may choose to\n   phase out IPv4 UEs and the IPv4\
    \ transport network.  This would leave\n   only IPv6 UEs.\n   Therefore, overall,\
    \ the transition scenario involving an IPv4 UE\n   communicating with an IPv4\
    \ peer through an IPv6 network is not\n   considered very likely in 3GPP networks.\n"

  - "3.4.  IPv6 UE Connecting to an IPv4 Node\n   Generally speaking, IPv6-only UEs\
    \ may be easier to manage, but that\n   would require all services to be used\
    \ over IPv6, and the universal\n   deployment of IPv6 probably is not realistic\
    \ in the near future.\n   Dual stack implementation requires management of both\
    \ IPv4 and IPv6\n   networks, and one approach is that \"legacy\" applications\
    \ keep using\n   IPv4 for the foreseeable future and new applications requiring\
    \ end-\n   to-end connectivity (for example, peer-to-peer services) use IPv6.\n\
    \   As a general guideline, IPv6-only UEs are not recommended in the\n   early\
    \ phases of transition until the IPv6 deployment has become so\n   prevalent that\
    \ direct communication with IPv4(-only) nodes will be\n   the exception and not\
    \ the rule.  It is assumed that IPv4 will remain\n   useful for quite a long time,\
    \ so in general, dual stack\n   implementation in the UE can be recommended. \
    \ This recommendation\n   naturally includes manufacturing dual stack UEs instead\
    \ of IPv4-only\n   UEs.\n   However, if there is a need to connect to an IPv4(-only)\
    \ node from an\n   IPv6-only UE, it is recommended to use specific translation\
    \ and\n   proxying techniques; generic IP protocol translation is not\n   recommended.\
    \  There are three main ways for IPv6(-only) nodes to\n   communicate with IPv4(-only)\
    \ nodes (excluding avoiding such\n   communication in the first place):\n    \
    \  1. the use of generic-purpose translator (e.g., NAT-PT [RFC2766])\n       \
    \  in the local network (not recommended as a general solution),\n      2. the\
    \ use of specific-purpose protocol relays (e.g., IPv6<->IPv4\n         TCP relay\
    \ configured for a couple of ports only [RFC3142]) or\n         application proxies\
    \ (e.g., HTTP proxy, SMTP relay) in the local\n         network, or\n      3.\
    \ the use of specific-purpose mechanisms (as described above in\n         2) in\
    \ the foreign network; these are indistinguishable from the\n         IPv6-enabled\
    \ services from the IPv6 UE's perspective and are\n         not discussed further\
    \ here.\n   For many applications, application proxies can be appropriate (e.g.,\n\
    \   HTTP proxies, SMTP relays, etc.)  Such application proxies will not\n   be\
    \ transparent to the UE.  Hence, a flexible mechanism with minimal\n   manual\
    \ intervention should be used to configure these proxies on IPv6\n   UEs.  Application\
    \ proxies can be placed, for example, on the GGSN\n   external interface (\"Gi\"\
    ), or inside the service network.\n   The authors note that [NATPTappl] discusses\
    \ the applicability of\n   NAT-PT, and [NATPTexp] discusses general issues with\
    \ all forms of\n   IPv6-IPv4 translation.  The problems related to NAT-PT usage\
    \ in 3GPP\n   networks are documented in Appendix A.\n"

  contents:
  - "4.1.  UE Connecting to a Node in an IPv4 Network through IMS\n   This scenario\
    \ occurs when an (IPv6) IMS UE connects to a node in the\n   IPv4 Internet through\
    \ the IMS, or vice versa.  This happens when the\n   other node is a part of a\
    \ different system than 3GPP, e.g., a fixed\n   PC, with only IPv4 capabilities.\n\
    \   Over time, users will upgrade the legacy IPv4 nodes to dual-stack,\n   often\
    \ by replacing the entire node, eliminating this particular\n   problem in that\
    \ specific deployment.\n   Still, it is difficult to estimate how many non-upgradable\
    \ legacy\n   IPv4 nodes need to communicate with the IMS UEs.  It is assumed that\n\
    \   the solution described here is used for limited cases, in which\n   communications\
    \ with a small number of legacy IPv4 SIP equipment are\n   needed.\n   As the\
    \ IMS is exclusively IPv6 [3GPP-23.221], for many of the\n   applications in the\
    \ IMS, some kind of translators may need to be used\n   in the communication between\
    \ the IPv6 IMS and the legacy IPv4 hosts\n   in cases where these legacy IPv4\
    \ hosts cannot be upgraded to support\n   IPv6.\n   This section gives a brief\
    \ analysis of the IMS interworking issues\n   and presents a high-level view of\
    \ SIP within the IMS.  The authors\n   recommend that a detailed solution for\
    \ the general SIP/SDP/media\n   IPv4/IPv6 transition problem will be specified\
    \ as soon as possible as\n   a task within the SIP-related Working Groups in the\
    \ IETF.\n   The issue of the IPv4/IPv6 interworking in SIP is somewhat more\n\
    \   challenging than many other protocols.  The control (or signaling)\n   and\
    \ user (or data) traffic are separated in SIP calls, and thus, the\n   IMS, the\
    \ transition of IMS traffic from IPv6 to IPv4, must be handled\n   at two levels:\n\
    \      1. Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) [RFC3261], and Session\n         Description\
    \ Protocol (SDP) [RFC2327] [RFC3266] (Mm-interface)\n      2. the user data traffic\
    \ (Mb-interface)\n   In addition, SIP carries an SDP body containing the addressing\
    \ and\n   other parameters for establishing the user data traffic (the media).\n\
    \   Hence, the two levels of interworking cannot be made independently.\n   Figure\
    \ 1 shows an example setup for IPv4 and IPv6 interworking in\n   IMS.  The \"\
    Interworking Unit\" comprises two internal elements a dual\n   stack SIP server\
    \ and a transition gateway (TrGW) for the media\n   traffic.  These two elements\

    \   On reception of an INVITE, the SIP server reserves an IP address and\n   a\
    \ port from the TrGW both for IPv4 and IPv6.  Then, the SIP server\n   acts as\
    \ a B2BUA (Back-to-Back User Agent) and rewrites the SDP of the\n   INVITE to\
    \ insert the transition gateway in the middle of the media\n   flow between the\
    \ two endpoints.\n   When performing its B2BUA role, the SIP server acts as a\
    \ UA (User\n   Agent) toward both the IMS and the IPv4 host.  Consequently, the\
    \ SIP\n   server needs to support all the extensions that apply to the session,\n\
    \   which are listed in the Require header fields of the SIP messages.\n   This\
    \ approach has a number of important drawbacks, however.  The\n   biggest drawback\
    \ is that the rewriting of the SDP in the SIP\n   signaling prevents securing\
    \ the SDP payload between the two\n   endpoints.  In addition, it breaks the end-to-end\
    \ negotiation of SIP\n   extensions required for each session.  Therefore, the\
    \ extensions to\n   be used in a particular session are limited by the extensions\n\
    \   supported by the SIP server acting as a B2BUA.  That is, the\n   introduction\
    \ of a new extension requires upgrading not only the UAs\n   but the B2BUAs as\
    \ well.\n   This analysis clearly shows that a new solution for IPv4-IPv6\n  \
    \ interworking in SIP networks is needed.  The ability to convey\n   multiple\
    \ alternative addresses in SDP session descriptions [RFC4091]\n   represents a\
    \ step in this direction.\n   Given the problems related to the use of B2BUAs,\
    \ it is recommended\n   that the SIP-related Working Groups quickly work on a\
    \ solution to\n   overcome the drawbacks of this approach.\n"

    \ access IP-based services.\n   There can also be other application-specific settings\
    \ in the UE that\n   are not described here.\n   UE configuration is required\
    \ in order to access IPv6- or IPv4-based\n   services.  The GGSN Access Point\
    \ has to be defined when using, for\n   example, the web-browsing application.\
    \  One possibility is to use\n   over-the-air configuration [OMA-CP] to configure\
    \ the GPRS settings.\n   The user can, for example, visit the operator WWW page\
    \ and subscribe\n   the GPRS Access Point settings to his/her UE and receive the\
    \ settings\n   via Short Message Service (SMS).  After the user has accepted the\n\
    \   settings and a PDP context has been activated, he/she can start\n   browsing.\
    \  The Access Point settings can also be typed in manually or\n   be pre-configured\

    \ (a control plane\n   mechanism).  A similar mechanism is also available for\
    \ IPv6: so-\n   called Protocol Configuration Options Information Element (PCO-IE)\n\
    \   specified by the 3GPP [3GPP-24.008].  It is also possible to use\n   [RFC3736]\
    \ (or [RFC3315]) and [RFC3646] for receiving DNS server\n   addresses.  Active\
    \ IETF work on DNS discovery mechanisms is ongoing\n   and might result in other\
    \ mechanisms becoming available over time.\n   The DNS server addresses can also\
    \ be received over the air (using\n   SMS) [OMA-CP] or typed in manually in the\
    \ UE.\n   When accessing IMS services, the UE needs to know the Proxy-Call\n \
    \  Session Control Function (P-CSCF) IPv6 address.  Either a 3GPP-\n   specific\
    \ PCO-IE mechanism or a DHCPv6-based mechanism ([RFC3736] and\n   [RFC3319]) can\

  - "6.  Summary and Recommendations\n   This document has analyzed five GPRS and\
    \ two IMS IPv6 transition\n   scenarios.  Numerous 3GPP networks are using private\
    \ IPv4 addresses\n   today, and introducing IPv6 is important.  The two first\
    \ GPRS\n   scenarios and both IMS scenarios are seen as the most relevant.  The\n\
    \   authors summarize some main recommendations here:\n      -  Dual stack UEs\
    \ are recommended instead of IPv4-only or IPv6-\n         only UEs.  It is important\
    \ to take care that applications in\n         the UEs support IPv6.  In other\
    \ words, applications should be\n         IP version independent.  IPv6-only UEs\
    \ can become feasible when\n         IPv6 is widely deployed in the networks,\
    \ and most services work\n         on IPv6.\n      -  It is recommended to activate\
    \ an IPv6 PDP context when\n         communicating with an IPv6 peer node and\
    \ an IPv4 PDP context\n         when communicating with an IPv4 peer node.\n \
    \     -  IPv6 communication is preferred to IPv4 communication going\n       \
    \  through IPv4 NATs to the same dual stack peer node.\n      -  This document\
    \ strongly recommends that the 3GPP operators\n         deploy basic IPv6 support\
    \ in their GPRS networks as soon as\n         possible.  That makes it possible\
    \ to lessen the transition\n         effects in the UEs.\n      -  A tunneling\
    \ mechanism in the UE may be needed during the early\n         phases of the IPv6\
    \ transition process.  A lightweight,\n         automatic tunneling mechanism\
    \ should be standardized in the\n         IETF.  See [zeroconf] for more details.\n\
    \      -  Tunneling mechanisms can be used in 3GPP networks, and only\n      \
    \   generic recommendations are given in this document.  More\n         details\
    \ can be found, for example, in [RFC4029].\n      -  The authors recommend that\
    \ a detailed solution for the general\n         SIP/SDP/media IPv4/IPv6 transition\
    \ problem be specified as soon\n         as possible as a task within the SIP-related\
    \ Working Groups in\n         the IETF.\n"

    \ has its own security considerations,\n   including:\n      -  native upstream\
    \ access or tunneling by the 3GPP network\n         operator,\n      -  use of\

- title: Appendix A - On the Use of Generic Translators in the 3GPP Networks
  contents:
  - "Appendix A - On the Use of Generic Translators in the 3GPP Networks\n   This\
    \ appendix lists mainly 3GPP-specific arguments about generic\n   translators,\
    \ even though the use of generic translators is\n   discouraged.\n   Due to the\
    \ significant lack of IPv4 addresses in some domains, port\n   multiplexing is\
    \ likely to be a necessary feature for translators\n   (i.e., NAPT-PT).  If NAPT-PT\
    \ is used, it needs to be placed on the\n   GGSN external interface (Gi), typically\
    \ separate from the GGSN.\n   NAPT-PT can be installed, for example, on the edge\
    \ of the operator's\n   network and the public Internet.  NAPT-PT will intercept\
    \ DNS requests\n   and other applications that include IP addresses in their payloads,\n\
    \   translate the IP header (and payload for some applications if\n   necessary),\
    \ and forward packets through its IPv4 interface.\n   NAPT-PT introduces limitations\
    \ that are expected to be magnified\n   within the 3GPP architecture.  [NATPTappl]\
    \ discusses the\n   applicability of NAT-PT in more detail.  [NATPTexp] discusses\
    \ general\n   issues with all forms of IPv6-IPv4 translation.\n   3GPP networks\
    \ are expected to handle a very large number of\n   subscribers on a single GGSN\
    \ (default router).  Each GGSN is expected\n   to handle hundreds of thousands\
    \ of connections.  Furthermore, high\n   reliability is expected for 3GPP networks.\
    \  Consequently, a single\n   point of failure on the GGSN external interface\
    \ would raise concerns\n   on the overall network reliability.  In addition, IPv6\
    \ users are\n   expected to use delay-sensitive applications provided by IMS.\
    \  Hence,\n   there is a need to minimize forwarding delays within the IP backbone.\n\
    \   Furthermore, due to the unprecedented number of connections handled\n   by\
    \ the default routers (GGSN) in 3GPP networks, a network design that\n   forces\
    \ traffic to go through a single node at the edge of the network\n   (typical\
    \ NAPT-PT configuration) is not likely to scale.  Translation\n   mechanisms should\
    \ allow for multiple translators, for load sharing\n   and redundancy purposes.\n\
    \   To minimize the problems associated with NAPT-PT, the following\n   actions\
    \ can be recommended:\n      1. Separate the DNS ALG from the NAPT-PT node (in\
    \ the \"IPv6 to\n         IPv4\" case).\n      2. Ensure (if possible) that NAPT-PT\
    \ does not become a single\n         point of failure.\n      3. Allow for load\
    \ sharing between different translators.  That is,\n         it should be possible\
    \ for different connections to go through\n         different translators.  Note\
    \ that load sharing alone does not\n         prevent NAPT-PT from becoming a single\
    \ point of failure.\n"
