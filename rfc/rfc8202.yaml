  - "Abstract\n   This document describes a mechanism that allows a single router\
    \ to\n   share one or more circuits among multiple Intermediate System to\n  \
    \ Intermediate System (IS-IS) routing protocol instances.\n   Multiple instances\
    \ allow the isolation of resources associated with\n   each instance.  Routers\
    \ will form instance-specific adjacencies.\n   Each instance can support multiple\
    \ topologies.  Each topology has a\n   unique Link State Database (LSDB).  Each\
    \ Protocol Data Unit (PDU)\n   will contain a new Type-Length-Value (TLV) identifying\
    \ the instance\n   and the topology (or topologies) to which the PDU belongs.\n\

- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   An existing limitation of the protocol defined by [ISO10589]\
    \ is that\n   only one instance of the protocol can operate on a given circuit.\n\
    \   This document defines an extension to IS-IS to remove this\n   restriction.\
    \  The extension is referred to as \"Multi-Instance IS-IS\"\n   (MI-IS-IS).\n\
    \   Routers that support this extension are referred to as \"Multi-\n   Instance-capable\
    \ routers\" (MI-RTR).\n   The use of multiple instances enhances the ability to\
    \ isolate the\n   resources associated with a given instance both within a router\
    \ and\n   across the network.  Instance-specific prioritization for processing\n\
    \   PDUs and performing routing calculations within a router may be\n   specified.\
    \  Instance-specific flooding parameters may also be defined\n   so as to allow\
    \ different instances to consume network-wide resources\n   at different rates.\n\
    \   Another existing protocol limitation is that a given instance\n   supports\
    \ a single Update Process operating on a single Link State\n   Database (LSDB).\
    \  This document defines an extension to IS-IS to\n   allow non-zero instances\
    \ of the protocol to support multiple Update\n   Processes.  Each Update Process\
    \ is associated with a topology and a\n   unique topology-specific LSDB.  Non-zero\
    \ instances of the protocol\n   are only supported by MI-RTRs.  Legacy routers\
    \ support the standard\n   or zero instance of the protocol.  The behavior of\
    \ the standard\n   instance is not changed in any way by the extensions defined\
    \ in this\n   document.\n   MI-IS-IS might be used to support topology-specific\
    \ routing.  Two\n   methods of supporting such a use are defined in this document:\
    \ one\n   supports the use of [RFC5120] within a reserved instance-specific\n\
    \   topology and the other is an alternative to [RFC5120] that supports\n   topology-specific\
    \ flooding of link state information.\n   MI-IS-IS might also be used to support\
    \ the advertisement of\n   information on behalf of applications [RFC6823].  The\
    \ advertisement\n   of information not directly related to the operation of the\
    \ IS-IS\n   protocol can therefore be done in a manner that minimizes its impact\n\
    \   on the operation of routing.\n   The above are examples of how MI-IS-IS might\
    \ be used.  The\n   specification of uses of MI-IS-IS is outside the scope of\
    \ this\n   document.\n"

- title: 3.  Elements of Procedure
  contents:
  - "3.  Elements of Procedure\n   An Instance Identifier (IID) is introduced to uniquely\
    \ identify an\n   IS-IS instance.  The protocol extension includes a new TLV (IID-TLV)\n\
    \   in each IS-IS PDU originated by an MI-RTR except as noted in this\n   document.\
    \  The IID-TLV identifies the unique instance as well as the\n   instance-specific\
    \ topology/topologies to which the PDU applies.  Each\n   IS-IS PDU is associated\
    \ with only one IS-IS instance.\n   MI-RTRs form instance-specific adjacencies.\
    \  The IID-TLV included in\n   IS-IS Hellos (IIHs) includes the IID and the set\
    \ of Instance-specific\n   Topology Identifiers (ITIDs) that the sending IS supports.\
    \  When\n   multiple instances share the same circuit, each instance will have\
    \ a\n   separate set of adjacencies.\n   MI-RTRs support the exchange of topology-specific\
    \ Link State PDUs for\n   the IID/ITID pairs that each neighbor supports.  A unique\
    \ IS-IS\n   Update Process (see [ISO10589]) operates for each IID/ITID pair.\n\
    \   This MAY also imply IID/ITID-specific routing calculations and\n   IID/ITID-specific\
    \ routing and forwarding tables.  However, this\n   aspect is outside the scope\
    \ of this specification.\n   The mechanisms used to implement support of the separation\
    \ of IS-IS\n   instances and topology-specific Update Processes within a router\
    \ are\n   outside the scope of this specification.\n"
- title: 3.1.  Instance Identifier TLV
  contents:
  - "3.1.  Instance Identifier TLV\n   A new TLV is defined in order to convey the\
    \ IID and ITIDs supported.\n   The IID-TLV associates a PDU with an IS-IS instance\
    \ using a unique\n   16-bit number.  The IID-TLV is carried in all IS-IS PDUs\
    \ that are\n   associated with a non-zero instance; this includes IIHs, Sequence\n\
    \   Number PDUs (SNPs), and Link State PDUs (LSPs) .\n   Multiple instances of\
    \ IS-IS may coexist on the same circuit and on\n   the same physical router. \
    \ IIDs MUST be unique within the same\n   routing domain.\n   IID #0 is reserved\
    \ for the standard instance supported by legacy\n   systems.  IS-IS PDUs associated\
    \ with the standard instance MUST NOT\n   include an IID-TLV except where noted\
    \ in this document.\n   The IID-TLV MAY include one or more ITIDs.  An ITID is\
    \ a 16-bit\n   identifier where all values (0 - 65535) are valid.\n   The following\
    \ format is used for the IID-TLV:\n     Type:   7\n     Length: 2 - 254\n    \
    \ Value:\n                                            No. of octets\n        \
    \         +-------------------------+\n                 | IID (0 - 65535)    \
    \     |     2\n                 +-------------------------+\n                \
    \ | Supported ITID          |     2\n                 +-------------------------+\n\
    \                 :                         :\n                 +-------------------------+\n\
    \                 | Supported ITID          |     2\n                 +-------------------------+\n\
    \      When the IID = 0, the list of supported ITIDs MUST NOT be present.\n  \
    \    An IID-TLV with IID = 0 MUST NOT appear in an SNP or LSP.  When\n      the\
    \ TLV appears (with a non-zero IID) in an SNP or LSP, exactly\n      one ITID\
    \ MUST be present, indicating the instance-specific\n      topology with which\
    \ the PDU is associated.  If no ITIDs or\n      multiple ITIDs are present or\
    \ the IID is zero, then the PDU MUST\n      be ignored.\n      When the IID is\
    \ non-zero and the TLV appears in an IIH, the set of\n      ITIDs supported on\
    \ the circuit over which the IIH is sent is\n      included.  There MUST be at\
    \ least one ITID present.\n      ITID #0 is reserved for a specific use case as\
    \ described later in\n      this document.  ITID #0 MUST NOT be supported in combination\
    \ with\n      any non-zero ITID.  If multiple ITIDs are advertised in an IIH and\n\
    \      one of the ITIDs is #0, then the PDU MUST be ignored.\n      Multiple IID-TLVs\
    \ MAY appear in IIHs.  If multiple IID-TLVs are\n      present and the IID value\
    \ in all IID-TLVs is not the same, then\n      the PDU MUST be ignored.\n   A\
    \ single IID-TLV will support advertisement of up to 126 ITIDs.  If\n   multiple\
    \ IID-TLVs are present in an IIH PDU, the supported set of\n   ITIDs is the union\
    \ of all ITIDs present in all IID-TLVs.\n   When an LSP purge is initiated, the\
    \ IID-TLV MUST be retained, but the\n   remainder of the body of the LSP SHOULD\
    \ be removed.  The purge\n   procedure is described in [RFC6233] and [RFC6232].\n\
    \   It is recommended that (when present) the IID-TLV(s) be the first\n   TLV(s)\
    \ in the PDU.  This allows determination of the association of a\n   PDU with\
    \ a particular instance more quickly.\n   A PDU without an IID-TLV belongs to\
    \ the standard instance.\n"

  contents:
  - "3.2.  Instance Membership\n   Each MI-RTR is configured to be participating in\
    \ one or more\n   instances of IS-IS.  For each non-zero instance in which it\n\
    \   participates, an MI-RTR marks IS-IS PDUs (IIHs, LSPs, or SNPs)\n   generated\
    \ that pertain to that instance by including the IID-TLV with\n   the appropriate\
    \ instance identifier.\n"

    \ is first used to\n   select the authentication configuration that is applicable.\
    \  The\n   authentication check is then performed as normal.  When multiple\n\
    \   ITIDs are supported, ITID-specific authentication MAY be used in SNPs\n  \
    \ and LSPs.\n"

    \ exchange IIH PDUs.\n   Two types of adjacencies exist in IS-IS: point-to-point\
    \ and\n   broadcast.  The following subsections describe the additional rules\n\
    \   an MI-RTR MUST follow when establishing adjacencies for non-zero\n   instances.\n"
- title: 3.4.1.  Point-to-Point Adjacencies
  contents:
  - "3.4.1.  Point-to-Point Adjacencies\n   MI-RTRs include the IID-TLV in the point-to-point\
    \ Hello PDUs\n   associated with non-zero instances that they originate.  Upon\n\
    \   reception of an IIH, an MI-RTR inspects the received IID-TLV, and if\n   the\
    \ IID matches any of the IIDs that the router supports on that\n   circuit, normal\
    \ adjacency establishment procedures are used to\n   establish an instance-specific\
    \ adjacency.  Note that the absence of\n   the IID-TLV implies IID #0.  For instances\
    \ other than IID #0, an\n   adjacency SHOULD NOT be established unless there is\
    \ at least one ITID\n   in common.\n   This extension allows an MI-RTR to establish\
    \ multiple adjacencies to\n   the same physical neighbor over a point-to-point\
    \ circuit.  However,\n   as the instances are logically independent, the normal\
    \ expectation of\n   at most one neighbor on a given point-to-point circuit still\
    \ applies.\n"

  - "3.4.2.  Multi-Access Adjacencies\n   Multi-Access (broadcast) circuits behave\
    \ differently than point-to-\n   point in that PDUs sent by one router are visible\

    \ Intermediate\n   System (DIS) independent of the set of ITIDs supported.\n \
    \  MI-RTRs will establish adjacencies and elect a DIS per IS-IS\n   instance.\
    \  Each MI-RTR will form adjacencies only with routers that\n   advertise support\
    \ for the instances that the local router has been\n   configured to support on\
    \ that circuit.  Since an MI-RTR is not\n   required to support all possible instances\

  contents:
  - "3.6.1.  Interoperability Issues on Broadcast Circuits\n   In order for routers\
    \ to correctly interoperate with routers not\n   implementing this extension and\

    \ Control (MAC) address is used for\n   multicasting IS-IS PDUs with any non-zero\

    \ address allows MI-RTRs\n   to exchange IS-IS PDUs with non-zero IIDs without\
    \ these PDUs being\n   processed by legacy routers; therefore, no disruption is\
    \ caused.\n   When sending SNPs, LSPs, and LAN IIHs for the standard instance\
    \ (IID\n   #0), an MI-RTR will use either the AllL1IS or the AllL2IS MAC-layer\n\

  - "4.2.  Many-to-One Mapping between Topologies and Instances\n   When the set of\
    \ information to be flooded in LSPs includes subsets\n   that are of interest\
    \ to a subset of the MI-RTRs supporting a given\n   IID, support of multiple ITIDs\
    \ allows each subset to be flooded only\n   to those MI-RTRs that are interested\
    \ in that subset.  In the simplest\n   case, a one-to-one mapping between a given\
    \ application and an ITID\n   allows the information associated with that application\
    \ to be flooded\n   only to MI-RTRs that support that application -- but a many-to-one\n\
    \   mapping between applications and a given ITID is also possible.  When\n  \
    \ the set of application-specific information is large, the use of\n   multiple\
    \ ITIDs provides significantly greater efficiencies, as\n   MI-RTRs only need\
    \ to maintain the LSDB for applications of interest\n   and that information only\
    \ needs to be flooded over a topology defined\n   by the MI-RTRs who support a\
    \ given ITID.\n   The use of multiple ITIDs also allows the dedication of a full\
    \ LSP\n   set (256 LSPs at each level) for the use of a given (set of)\n   applications,\
    \ thereby minimizing the possibility of exceeding the\n   carrying capacity of\
    \ an LSP set.  Such a possibility might arise if\n   information for all applications\
    \ were to be included in a single LSP\n   set.\n   Note that the topology associated\
    \ with each ITID MUST be fully\n   connected in order for ITID-specific LSPs to\
    \ be successfully flooded\n   to all MI-RTRs that support that ITID.\n   When\
    \ multiple ITIDs are supported by an instance, ITID #0 MUST NOT be\n   supported.\n"

    \  However, in cases where the set of topologies desired in\n   support of a set\

  - "5.  Relationship to M-ISIS\n   [RFC5120] defines support for multi-topology routing.\
    \  In that\n   document, 12-bit Multi-Topology Identifiers (MTIDs) are defined\
    \ to\n   identify the topologies that an IS-IS instance (a \"standard instance\"\
    \n   as defined by this document) supports.  There is no relationship\n   between\
    \ the MTIDs defined in [RFC5120] and the ITIDs defined in this\n   document.\n\
    \   An MI-RTR MAY use the extensions defined in this document to support\n   multiple\
    \ topologies in the context of an instance with a non-zero\n   IID.  Each MI topology\
    \ is associated with a unique LSDB identified by\n   an ITID.  An ITID-specific\
    \ IS-IS Update Process operates on each\n   topology.  This differs from [RFC5120],\
    \ where a single LSDB and\n   single IS-IS Update Process are used in support\
    \ of all topologies.\n   In such cases, if an MI-RTR uses the extensions in support\
    \ of the\n   BFD-Enabled TLV [RFC6213], the ITID MUST be used in place of the\n\
    \   MTID; in which case, all 16 bits of the identifier field are useable.\n  \
    \ An MI-RTR MAY support [RFC5120] multi-topology within a non-zero\n   instance\
    \ when ITID #0 is supported.  When ITID #0 is supported it\n   MUST be the only\
    \ ITID supported by that instance.  In such cases, if\n   an MI-RTR uses the extensions\
    \ in support of the BFD Enabled TLV\n   [RFC6213] the [RFC5120] MTID MUST be used\
    \ as specified in [RFC6213].\n   An MI-RTR MUST NOT support [RFC5120] multi-topology\
    \ within a non-zero\n   instance when any non-zero ITID is supported.  The following\
    \ TLVs\n   MUST NOT be sent in an LSP associated with a non-zero instance that\n\
    \   supports a non-zero ITID, and such an LSP MUST be ignored when\n   received:\n\

  contents:
  - "Appendix A.  Changes to RFC 6822\n   RFC 6822 prohibited the use of Multi-Topology\
    \ (MT) support as\n   described in RFC 5120 in a non-zero instance.  However,\
    \ deployment\n   experience since the writing of RFC 6822 has revealed a desire\
    \ to be\n   able to support the style of MT in RFC 5120 using multiple non-zero\n\
    \   instances as an alternative means of controlling leaking of\n   information\
    \ between L1 areas while also supporting incongruent\n   topologies for different\
    \ address families.  The rules have therefore\n   been relaxed to allow use of\
    \ MT per RFC 5120 in a non-zero instance\n   so long as ITID #0 is the only instance\
    \ topology (ITID) supported by\n   the instance.  Note that this change is not\
    \ backwards compatible with\n   implementations strictly following RFC 6822. \
    \ As of this writing, all\n   known implementations are compatible with this change.\n\
    \   A suggestion has been added to place the IID-TLV as the first TLV in\n   a\
    \ PDU to speed recognition of the correct instance when parsing a\n   received\
    \ PDU.\n   Clarification that when operating in point-to-point mode on a\n   broadcast\
    \ circuit the IID-TLV is only included in point-to-point IIHs\n   associated with\
    \ non-zero instances has been added.  This addresses\n   Errata ID 4519 [Err4519].\n\
    \   Clarification of the appropriate MAC multicast addresses to use when\n   sending\
    \ PDUs on a broadcast interface for both standard instance and\n   non-zero instances\
    \ has been provided.  This addresses Errata ID 4520\n   [Err4520].\n"
