- title: Abstract
  contents:
  - "Abstract\n   In certain networks, such as, but not limited to, financial\n  \
    \ information networks (e.g., stock market data providers), network\n   performance\
    \ criteria (e.g., latency) are becoming as critical to data\n   path selection\
    \ as other metrics and constraints.  These metrics are\n   associated with the\
    \ Service Level Agreement (SLA) between customers\n   and service providers. \
    \ The link bandwidth utilization (the total\n   bandwidth of a link in actual\
    \ use for the forwarding) is another\n   important factor to consider during path\
    \ computation.\n   IGP Traffic Engineering (TE) Metric Extensions describe mechanisms\n\
    \   with which network performance information is distributed via OSPF\n   and\
    \ IS-IS, respectively.  The Path Computation Element Communication\n   Protocol\
    \ (PCEP) provides mechanisms for Path Computation Elements\n   (PCEs) to perform\
    \ path computations in response to Path Computation\n   Client (PCC) requests.\
    \  This document describes the extension to PCEP\n   to carry latency, delay variation,\
    \ packet loss, and link bandwidth\n   utilization as constraints for end-to-end\
    \ path computation.\n"

  - "1.  Introduction\n   Real-time network performance information is becoming critical\
    \ in the\n   path computation in some networks.  Mechanisms to measure latency,\n\
    \   delay variation, and packet loss in an MPLS network are described in\n   [RFC6374].\
    \  It is important that latency, delay variation, and packet\n   loss are considered\
    \ during the path selection process, even before\n   the Label Switched Path (LSP)\
    \ is set up.\n   Link bandwidth utilization based on real-time traffic along the\
    \ path\n   is also becoming critical during path computation in some networks.\n\
    \   Thus, it is important that the link bandwidth utilization is factored\n  \
    \ in during the path computation.\n   The Traffic Engineering Database (TED) is\
    \ populated with network\n   performance information like link latency, delay\
    \ variation, packet\n   loss, as well as parameters related to bandwidth (residual\
    \ bandwidth,\n   available bandwidth, and utilized bandwidth) via TE Metric Extensions\n\
    \   in OSPF [RFC7471] or IS-IS [RFC7810] or via a management system.\n   [RFC7823]\
    \ describes how a Path Computation Element (PCE) [RFC4655]\n   can use that information\
    \ for path selection for explicitly routed\n   LSPs.\n   A Path Computation Client\
    \ (PCC) can request a PCE to provide a path\n   meeting end-to-end network performance\
    \ criteria.  This document\n   extends the Path Computation Element Communication\
    \ Protocol (PCEP)\n   [RFC5440] to handle network performance constraints that\
    \ include any\n   combination of latency, delay variation, packet loss, and bandwidth\n\
    \   utilization constraints.\n   [RFC7471] and [RFC7810] describe various considerations\
    \ regarding:\n   o  Announcement thresholds and filters\n   o  Announcement suppression\n\
    \   o  Announcement periodicity and network stability\n   The first two provide\
    \ configurable mechanisms to bound the number of\n   re-advertisements in IGP.\
    \  The third provides a way to throttle\n   announcements.  Section 1.2 of [RFC7823]\
    \ also describes the\n   oscillation and stability considerations while advertising\
    \ and\n   considering service-aware information.\n"

    \ advertised as\n   TE links into the higher-layer network form a Virtual Network\n\

- title: 6.2.  Reoptimizing Paths
  contents:
  - "6.2.  Reoptimizing Paths\n   [RFC6374] defines the measurement of loss, delay,\
    \ and related metrics\n   over LSPs.  A PCC can utilize these measurement techniques.\
    \  In case\n   it detects a degradation of network performance parameters relative\n\
    \   to the value of the constraint it gave when the path was set up, or\n   relative\
    \ to an implementation-specific threshold, it MAY ask the PCE\n   to reoptimize\
    \ the path by sending a PCReq with the R bit set in the\n   RP object, as per\
    \ [RFC5440].\n   A PCC may also detect the degradation of an LSP without making\
    \ any\n   direct measurements, by monitoring the TED (as populated by the IGP)\n\
    \   for changes in the network performance parameters of the links that\n   carry\
    \ its LSPs.  The PCC can issue a reoptimization request for any\n   impacted LSPs.\
    \  For example, a PCC can monitor the link bandwidth\n   utilization along the\
    \ path by monitoring changes in the bandwidth\n   utilization parameters of one\
    \ or more links on the path in the TED.\n   If the bandwidth utilization percentage\
    \ of any of the links in the\n   path changes to a value less than that required\
    \ when the path was set\n   up, or otherwise less than an implementation-specific\
    \ threshold, then\n   the PCC can issue a reoptimization request to a PCE.\n \
    \  A stateful PCE can also determine which LSPs should be reoptimized\n   based\
    \ on network events or triggers from external monitoring systems.\n   For example,\
    \ when a particular link deteriorates and its loss\n   increases, this can trigger\
    \ the stateful PCE to automatically\n   determine which LSPs are impacted and\
    \ should be reoptimized.\n"

    \ those\n   discussed in [RFC5440] and [RFC5541] in itself.  Some deployments\

    \ sensitive information about the operations of the\n   network.  Thus, such deployment\
    \ should employ suitable PCEP security\n   mechanisms like TCP Authentication\

  - "Appendix A.  PCEP Requirements\n   End-to-end service optimization based on latency,\
    \ delay variation,\n   packet loss, and link bandwidth utilization are key requirements\
    \ for\n   service providers.  The following associated key requirements are\n\
    \   identified for PCEP:\n   1.  A PCE supporting this specification MUST have\
    \ the capability to\n       compute end-to-end paths with latency, delay variation,\
    \ packet\n       loss, and bandwidth utilization constraints.  It MUST also\n\
    \       support the combination of network performance constraints\n       (latency,\
    \ delay variation, loss,...) with existing constraints\n       (cost, hop-limit,...).\n\
    \   2.  A PCC MUST be able to specify any network performance constraint\n   \
    \    in a PCReq message to be applied during the path computation.\n   3.  A PCC\
    \ MUST be able to request that a PCE optimizes a path using\n       any network\
    \ performance criteria.\n   4.  A PCE that supports this specification is not\
    \ required to provide\n       service-aware path computation to any PCC at any\
    \ time.\n       Therefore, it MUST be possible for a PCE to reject a PCReq\n \
    \      message with a reason code that indicates service-aware path\n       computation\
    \ is not supported.  Furthermore, a PCE that does not\n       support this specification\
    \ will either ignore or reject such\n       requests using pre-existing mechanisms;\
    \ therefore, the requests\n       MUST be identifiable to legacy PCEs, and rejections\
    \ by legacy\n       PCEs MUST be acceptable within this specification.\n   5.\
    \  A PCE SHOULD be able to return end-to-end network performance\n       information\
    \ of the computed path in a PCRep message.\n   6.  A PCE SHOULD be able to compute\
    \ multi-domain (e.g., Inter-AS,\n       Inter-Area, or Multi-Layer) service-aware\
    \ paths.\n   Such constraints are only meaningful if used consistently: for\n\
    \   instance, if the delay of a computed path segment is exchanged\n   between\
    \ two PCEs residing in different domains, a consistent way of\n   defining the\
    \ delay must be used.\n"
