  - "1.  Introduction\n   The Incident Object Description Exchange Format (IODEF)\
    \ [RFC5070]\n   describes an XML document format for the purpose of exchanging\
    \ data\n   between Computer Security Incident Response Teams (CSIRTs) or those\n\
    \   responsible for security incident handling for service providers\n   (SPs).\
    \  The defined document format provides a simple way for CSIRTs\n   to exchange\
    \ data in a way which can be easily parsed.\n   IODEF defines a message format,\
    \ not a protocol, as the sharing of\n   messages is assumed to be out of scope\
    \ in order to allow CSIRTs to\n   exchange and store messages in a way most suited\
    \ to their established\n   incident-handling processes.  However, Real-time Inter-network\n\
    \   Defense (RID) [RFC6545] does require a specification of a protocol to\n  \
    \ ensure interoperability among members in a RID consortium.  This\n   document\
    \ specifies the transport of RID messages within HTTP\n   [RFC2616] Request and\
    \ Response messages over TLS [RFC5246] (herein,\n   HTTP/TLS).  Note that any\
    \ IODEF message may also be transported using\n   this mechanism, by sending it\
    \ as a RID Report message.\n"

- title: 3.  Transmission of RID Messages over HTTP/TLS
  contents:
  - "3.  Transmission of RID Messages over HTTP/TLS\n   This section specifies the\
    \ details of the transport of RID messages\n   [RFC6545] over HTTP/TLS.  In this\
    \ arrangement, each RID server is\n   both an HTTP/TLS server and an HTTP/TLS\
    \ client.  When a RID message\n   is sent, the sending RID system connects to\
    \ the receiving RID system\n   and sends the message, optionally receiving a message\
    \ in reply.  Each\n   RID system MUST be prepared to accept HTTP/TLS connections\
    \ from any\n   RID peer with which it communicates, in order to support callback\
    \ for\n   delayed replies (see below).\n   BCP 56 [RFC3205] contains a number\
    \ of important considerations when\n   using HTTP for application protocols. \
    \ These include the size of the\n   payload for the application, whether the application\
    \ will use a web\n   browser, whether the protocol should be defined on a port\
    \ other than\n   80, and if the security provided through HTTP/TLS suits the needs\
    \ of\n   the new application.\n   It is acknowledged within the scope of these\
    \ concerns that HTTP/TLS\n   is not ideally suited for RID transport, as the former\
    \ is a client-\n   server protocol and the latter a message-exchange protocol;\
    \ however,\n   the ease of implementation of RID systems over HTTP/TLS outweighs\n\
    \   these concerns.  Consistent with BCP 56, RID systems listen for TCP\n   connections\
    \ on port 4590 (see Section 5).  Every RID system\n   participating in a consortium\
    \ SHOULD listen for HTTP/TLS connections\n   on the assigned port.  RID systems\
    \ MAY be configurable to listen on\n   ports other than the well-known port; this\
    \ configuration is out of\n   scope for this specification.  RID systems SHOULD\
    \ NOT use TCP port\n   443 (the standard port for HTTP over TLS) for RID messages\
    \ in order\n   to avoid confusing standard HTTP/TLS servers for RID systems.\n\
    \   RID systems MUST implement all REQUIRED functionality for HTTP/1.1\n   [RFC2616].\
    \  All RID messages sent in HTTP Requests MUST be sent using\n   the POST method\
    \ with a Request-URI of '/'.  As RID documents are XML,\n   the RID media type\
    \ is 'text/xml'; i.e., the 'Content-type' Request\n   and Response headers MUST\
    \ be 'text/xml'.  As RID messages MUST be\n   sent using the POST method, the\
    \ GET and HEAD methods have no\n   particular meaning on a RID system; a RID system\
    \ SHOULD answer\n   'GET /' or 'HEAD /' with 204 No Content.  Other Request-URIs\
    \ are\n   reserved for future use; any access to Request-URIs other than '/' by\n\
    \   any method on a RID system SHOULD return the appropriate HTTP error\n   (404\
    \ Not Found).\n   Since the content of RID messages is essentially declarative,\
    \ a RID\n   system interrupted during transport MAY simply repeat the\n   transaction;\
    \ the sending of a RID message is idempotent.\n   As the queries and replies in\
    \ a RID message exchange may be\n   significantly separated in time, RID over\
    \ HTTP/TLS supports a\n   callback mechanism.  In this mechanism, the receiving\
    \ RID system MAY\n   return a 202 Accepted response, called a RID callback, instead\
    \ of a\n   RID message.  The RID callback MUST contain a zero-length entity body\n\
    \   and a 'RID-Callback-Token' entity header field, itself containing a\n   unique\
    \ token generated by the receiving RID system.\n   The RID-Callback-Token is an\
    \ opaque, whitespace-free string of up to\n   255 printable ASCII characters that\
    \ MUST uniquely identify the\n   callback among all callbacks from the receiving\
    \ RID system to the\n   sending RID system.  Due to the amount of time that may\
    \ be required\n   to generate a RID Result or Report response, there is no upper\
    \ bound\n   on the time period for this uniqueness requirement.  The RID-\n  \
    \ Callback-Token in ABNF [RFC5234] form is shown below:\n   callback-token = 1*255(VCHAR)\n\
    \   When performing RID callback, a responding system MUST connect to the\n  \
    \ host at the network-layer address from which the original request was\n   sent;\
    \ there is no mechanism in RID for redirected callback.  This\n   callback SHOULD\
    \ use TCP port 4590 unless configured to use a\n   different port.\n   While a\
    \ RID system SHOULD return the reply in an HTTP Response if it\n   is available\
    \ immediately or within a generally accepted HTTP client\n   timeout (about thirty\
    \ seconds), this is not mandatory, and as such\n   RID systems MUST be prepared\
    \ for a query to be met with a 202\n   Accepted, an empty Response body, a connection\
    \ termination, and a\n   callback.  Note that all RID messages require a response\
    \ from the\n   receiving RID system, so a sending RID system can expect either\
    \ an\n   immediate response or a callback.\n   Table 1 lists the allowable RID\
    \ message types in an HTTP Response for\n   a given RID message type in the Request.\
    \  A RID system MUST be\n   prepared to handle an HTTP Response of the given type(s)\
    \ when sending\n   the corresponding HTTP Request.  A RID system MUST NOT send\
    \ an HTTP\n   Response containing any RID message other than the one corresponding\n\
    \   to the one sent in the HTTP Request.\n     +----------------------+----------+--------+-------------------+\n\

    \                                  Table 1\n   The use of stable DNS names to\
    \ address RID systems is RECOMMENDED; in\n   addition to facilitating connection\
    \ to RID systems within a\n   consortium, these are to be used as reference identifiers\
    \ for a RID\n   system's peers.  For security purposes, RID systems SHOULD NOT\
    \ return\n   3xx Redirection response codes, and SHOULD NOT follow any 3xx\n \
    \  Redirection.  The protocol provides no in-band method for handling a\n   change\
    \ of address of a RID system.\n   If a RID system receives an improper RID message\
    \ in an HTTP Request,\n   it MUST return an appropriate 4xx Client Error result\
    \ code to the\n   requesting RID system.  If a RID system cannot process a RID\
    \ message\n   received in an HTTP Request due to an error on its own side, it\
    \ MUST\n   return an appropriate 5xx Server Error result code to the requesting\n\
    \   RID system.\n   Note that HTTP provides no mechanism for signaling to a server\
    \ that a\n   response body is not a valid RID message.  If a RID system receives\n\
    \   an improper RID message in an HTTP Response, or cannot process a RID\n   message\
    \ received in an HTTP Response due to an error on its own side,\n   it MUST log\
    \ the error and present it to the RID system administrator\n   for handling; the\
    \ error logging format is an implementation detail\n   and is considered out of\
    \ scope for this specification.\n   RID systems MUST support and SHOULD use HTTP/1.1\
    \ persistent\n   connections as described in [RFC2616].  RID systems MUST support\n\
    \   chunked transfer encoding on the HTTP server side to allow the\n   implementation\
    \ of clients that do not need to pre-calculate message\n   sizes before constructing\
    \ HTTP headers.\n   RID systems MUST use TLS version 1.1 [RFC4346] or higher for\n\
    \   confidentiality, identification, and authentication, when sending RID\n  \
    \ messages over HTTPS.  HTTPS is specified in Section 2 of [RFC2818].\n   RID\
    \ systems MUST use mutual authentication; that is, both RID systems\n   acting\
    \ as HTTPS clients and RID systems acting as HTTPS servers MUST\n   be identified\
    \ by an X.509 certificate [RFC5280].  Mutual\n   authentication requires full\
    \ path validation on each certificate, as\n   defined in [RFC5280].\n   The TLS\
    \ session MUST use non-NULL ciphersuites for authentication,\n   integrity, and\
    \ confidentiality.  Sessions MAY be renegotiated within\n   these constraints.\n\
    \   All RID systems SHOULD be identified by a certificate containing\n   DNS-ID\
    \ identifier as in Section 6.4 of [RFC6125]; the inclusion of\n   Common Names\
    \ (CN-IDs) in certificates identifying RID systems is NOT\n   RECOMMENDED.  RID\
    \ systems MUST verify the reference identifiers of\n   their peers against those\
    \ stored in the certificates presented using\n   one of the methods in the following\
    \ paragraph.  Wildcards MUST NOT\n   appear in the DNS-ID or CN-ID of a certificate\
    \ identifying a RID\n   system.\n   RID systems MUST support the verification\
    \ of certificates against an\n   explicit whitelist of peer certificates.  RID\
    \ systems SHOULD support\n   the verification of reference identifiers by matching\
    \ the DNS-ID or\n   CN-ID with a reverse DNS lookup of the connecting RID peer;\
    \ this\n   support SHOULD allow the lookup to be cached and/or done in advance\n\
    \   in order to ensure verifiability during instability or compromise of\n   DNS\
    \ itself.\n   Additional general information on the use of PKI with RID systems\
    \ is\n   detailed in Section 9.3 of [RFC6545].\n   RID systems MUST support TLS\
    \ version 1.1 and SHOULD support TLS\n   version 1.2 [RFC5246]; RID systems MUST\
    \ NOT request, offer, or use\n   any version of SSL, or any version of TLS prior\
    \ to 1.1, due to known\n   security vulnerabilities in prior versions of the protocol;\
    \ see\n   Appendix E of [RFC5246] for more information.\n"
