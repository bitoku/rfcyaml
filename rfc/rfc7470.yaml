  - "1.  Introduction\n   A Path Computation Element (PCE) is an entity (component,\n\
    \   application, or network node) that is capable of computing a network\n   path\
    \ or route based on a network graph and applying computational\n   constraints.\
    \  An architecture for the use of PCEs is defined in\n   [RFC4655].\n   The Path\
    \ Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCEP) is defined\n   in [RFC5440]\
    \ to exchange path computation requests and responses\n   between Path Computation\
    \ Clients (PCCs) and PCEs.  It is also used\n   between cooperating PCEs.\n  \
    \ Path computations performed by a PCE depend on a set of constraints\n   indicated\
    \ by the PCC.  These constraints include the endpoints of the\n   path to compute\
    \ (source and destination) and may include other simple\n   constraints such as\
    \ bandwidth requirements and metric maxima (for\n   example, a maximum threshold\
    \ for the hop count or the Traffic\n   Engineering (TE) metric of the computed\
    \ path).\n   The PCE also needs to use an objective function to qualify the path\n\
    \   it selects as meeting the requirements of the PCC.  The PCE may have\n   a\
    \ default objective function, but the PCC can also indicate which\n   objective\
    \ function it wants applied by placing an Objective Function\n   object in the\
    \ path computation request message [RFC5541].  A core set\n   of objective functions\
    \ to be supported in PCEP messages is defined in\n   the base PCEP requirements\
    \ [RFC4657], and [RFC5541] defines each of\n   these functions as an abstract\
    \ formula.\n   The registry of codepoints used to indicate objective functions\
    \ is\n   managed by IANA and new assignments can be made according to \"IETF\n\
    \   Review\" and \"First Come First Served\" policies [RFC5226].  PCE\n   implementations\
    \ may also choose to offer proprietary, vendor-specific\n   objective functions,\
    \ and there is scope for this within the codepoint\n   registry created by [RFC5541]\
    \ using the codepoints that are flagged\n   as \"Reserved for Private Use\".\n\
    \   Proprietary objective functions may operate on non-standard\n   constraints\
    \ or metrics.  The PCEP METRIC Object defined in [RFC5440]\n   has scope for the\
    \ definition of new, standardized metrics, but no\n   facility for the definition\
    \ of vendor-specific metrics.  At the same\n   time, there is no mechanism in\
    \ PCEP for carrying other, more complex,\n   vendor-specific information.\n  \
    \ This document defines a new PCEP object, the Vendor Information\n   object that\
    \ can be used to carry arbitrary, proprietary information\n   such as vendor-specific\
    \ constraints.\n   This document also defines a new PCEP TLV, the VENDOR-INFORMATION-TLV\n\
    \   that can be used to carry arbitrary information within any existing\n   or\
    \ future PCEP object that supports TLVs.\n   It should be noted that by the very\
    \ definition of \"vendor-specific\",\n   the inclusion of either a Vendor Information\
    \ object or the VENDOR-\n   INFORMATION-TLV implies an inability to interoperate\
    \ at a functional\n   level with implementations from other vendors unless there\
    \ is some\n   cooperation agreement between vendors.  Sections 2.1 and 3.1 discuss\n\
    \   backward compatibility, which indicates how these protocol constructs\n  \
    \ are handled by implementations that do not support them at all, while\n   text\
    \ in Sections 2 and 3 describe how implementations handle the\n   constructs if\
    \ they understand them, but do not support the embedded\n   Enterprise Number\
    \ that indicates to which vendor the constructs\n   apply.\n   When vendor-specific\
    \ information is used by an implementation, the\n   vendor is encouraged to document\
    \ the meaning of the information to\n   encourage wider use and implementation.\
    \  In particular, when there is\n   more general interest in a vendor-specific\
    \ extension, the vendor is\n   encouraged to bring it to the IETF for standardization\
    \ as a regular\n   protocol construct, thereby moving it out of the vendor-specific\n\
    \   space.\n   This document obsoletes RFC 7150 [RFC7150], making two changes\
    \ to\n   that document:\n   -  Clarification that the TLV is available for use\
    \ in any PCEP object\n      (existing or future) that supports TLVs.\n   -  The\
    \ allocation of a different code point for the\n      VENDOR-INFORMATION object.\
    \  This change became necessary because\n      of an inadvertent clash with codepoints\
    \ used in an Internet-Draft\n      that had been deployed without IANA allocation.\
    \  The PCE working\n      group has conducted a survey of implementations and\
    \ deployments of\n      RFC 7150 and considers that this change is safe and does\
    \ not harm\n      early implementers of RFC 7150.\n"

  contents:
  - "2.  Procedures for the Vendor Information Object\n   A PCC that wants to convey\
    \ proprietary or vendor-specific constraints\n   or metrics to a PCE does so by\
    \ including a Vendor Information object\n   in the PCReq message.  The contents\
    \ and format of the object are\n   described in Section 4, but it is important\
    \ to note that the object\n   includes an Enterprise Number that is a unique identifier\
    \ of an\n   organization responsible for the definition of the content and\n \
    \  meaning of the object.\n   A PCE that receives a PCReq message containing a\
    \ Vendor Information\n   object MUST act according to the P flag in the object\
    \ header.  That\n   is, if the P flag is set, the object will be treated as mandatory\
    \ and\n   the request will either be processed using the contents of the object\n\
    \   or be rejected as defined in [RFC5440] (see also Section 2.1).  If\n   the\
    \ P flag is clear, then, as defined in [RFC5440], the object may be\n   used by\
    \ the PCE or may be ignored.  The PCC sets the P flag according\n   to how it\
    \ wishes the request to be processed.\n   The PCE determines how to interpret\
    \ the information in the Vendor\n   Information object by examining the Enterprise\
    \ Number it contains.\n   An implementation that supports the Vendor Information\
    \ object, but\n   receives one carrying an Enterprise Number that it does not\
    \ support\n   MUST act according to the P flag in the object.  That is, if the\
    \ P\n   flag is set, the PCE MUST reject the PCReq as defined in [RFC5440] by\n\
    \   sending an Error message with Error-Type=\"Not supported Object\" along\n\
    \   with the corresponding Vendor Information object.\n   The Vendor Information\
    \ object is OPTIONAL in a PCReq message.\n   Multiple instances of the object\
    \ MAY be used on a single PCReq\n   message, and each MUST be treated according\
    \ to its P-bit setting.\n   Different instances of the object can have different\
    \ Enterprise\n   Numbers.\n   The object can be present in the PCReq message to\
    \ enable it to apply\n   to a single path computation request or to a set of synchronized\n\
    \   requests.  This usage mirrors the usage of the Objective Function\n   object\
    \ [RFC5541].  Thus, the PCReq message based on [RFC6006] is\n   encoded as follows\

  - "6.4.  Verifying Correct Operation\n   This document makes no change to the basic\
    \ operation of PCEP, so\n   there are no changes to the requirements or techniques\
    \ for monitoring\n   the correct operation of the protocol out in [RFC4657] and\
    \ [RFC5440].\n   Note that \"correct operation\" in this context refers to the\
    \ operation\n   of the protocol itself and not to the operation of the computation\n\
    \   algorithms which are out of scope for all PCEP work.\n   Mechanisms for verifying\
    \ the correct operation of computation\n   algorithms might involve comparing\
    \ the results returned by more than\n   one PCE.  Scope for this might be limited\
    \ by the use of vendor\n   information unless multiple PCEs support the same set\
    \ of vendor\n   information.\n"

  contents:
  - "6.5.  Requirements on Other Protocols and Functional Components\n   This document\
    \ does not place any new requirements on other network\n   components or protocols.\
    \  However, it may be beneficial to consider\n   whether a PCE should advertise\
    \ the Enterprise Numbers and vendor\n   information it supports.  This advertisement\
    \ could be within PCE\n   Discovery [RFC5088] [RFC5089] or through extensions\
    \ to PCEP\n   [RFC5440].\n   Extensions for discovery and advertisement are outside\
    \ the scope of\n   this document.\n"
- title: 6.6.  Impact on Network Operation
  contents:
  - "6.6.  Impact on Network Operation\n   The availability of vendor information\
    \ in PCEP messages may\n   facilitate more complex and detailed path computations\
    \ that may\n   enhance the way in which the network is operated.\n   On the other\
    \ hand, the presence of additional vendor-specific\n   information in PCEP messages\
    \ may congest the operation of the\n   protocol especially if the PCE does not\
    \ support the information\n   supplied by the PCC.  Thus, a PCC SHOULD monitor\
    \ the capabilities of\n   a PCE either by discovery mechanisms as described in\
    \ Section 6.5 or\n   through the receipt of negative responses.  A PCC SHOULD\
    \ NOT include\n   vendor information in a PCReq message to a PCE that it believes\
    \ does\n   not support the information and that will not forward the request to\n\
    \   some other PCE that does support the information.\n"
- title: 7.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "7.  Security Considerations\n   The protocol extensions defined in this document\
    \ do not substantially\n   change the nature of PCEP.  Therefore, the security\
    \ considerations\n   set out in [RFC5440] apply unchanged.  Note that further\
    \ security\n   considerations for the use of PCEP over TCP are presented in\n\
    \   [RFC6952].\n   Operators should note that an attack on PCEP may involve making\
    \ PCEP\n   messages as large as possible in order to consume bandwidth and\n \
    \  processing power.  The Vendor Information object and TLV may provide\n   a\
    \ vector for this type of attack.  It may be protected against by\n   using the\
    \ authentication and integrity procedures described in\n   [RFC5440].\n"
