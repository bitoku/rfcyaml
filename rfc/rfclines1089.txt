Overview and Rational SNMP has been successful in managing Internet capable network elements which support the protocol stack at least through UDP the connectionless Internet transport layer protocol.
As originally designed, SNMP is capable of running over any reasonable transport mechanism (not necessarily a transport protocol) that supports bi  directional flow and addressability.
Many non Internet capable network elements are present in local networks; for example, repeaters and wiring concentrators.
They include both addressability, and programmable intelligence.
These devices are widely used and increasingly important yet, for the most part, invisible except through proprietary mechanisms.
Almost all Internet capable network elements use the same mechanism for encapsulation of the Internet protocol stack regardless of conformity with the physical characteristics of Ethernet or 802.3, this mechanism is specified in [3] and [4].
This specification continues that style with the assignment (by XEROX) of 33100 (hexadecimal 814C) to the Ethernet Type field for SNMP.
The data portion of the Ethernet frame would then be a standard SNMP message as specified in [1].
