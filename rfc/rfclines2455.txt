Abstract This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB) for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
In particular, it defines objects for monitoring and controlling network devices with APPN (Advanced Peer to Peer Networking)
This memo identifies managed objects for the APPN protocol.
This document is a product of the SNA NAU Services MIB Working Group.
It defines a MIB module for managing devices with Advanced Peer to  Peer Networking (APPN) capabilities.
The SNMP Network Management Framework
Mechanisms for describing and naming objects and events for the purpose of management.
The first version of this Structure of Management Information (SMI) is called SMIv1 and described in STD 16, RFC 1155 [2], STD 16, RFC 1212 [3] and RFC 1215 [4].
The second version, called SMIv2, is described in RFC 1902 [5], RFC 1903 [6] and RFC 1904 [7].
Message protocols for transferring management information.
The first version of the SNMP message protocol is called SNMPv1 and described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [8].
A second version of the SNMP message protocol, which is not an Internet standards track protocol, is called SNMPv2c and described in RFC 1901 [9] and RFC 1906 [10].
The third version of the message protocol is called SNMPv3 and described in RFC 1906 [10], RFC 2272 [11] and RFC 2274 [12].
Protocol operations for accessing management information.
The first set of protocol operations and associated PDU formats is described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [8].
A second set of protocol operations and associated PDU formats is described in RFC 1905 [13].
A set of fundamental applications described in RFC 2273 [14] and the view based access control mechanism described in RFC 2275 [15].
Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed the Management Information Base or MIB.
Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the SMI.
This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2.
A MIB conforming to the SMIv1 can be produced through the appropriate translations.
The resulting translated MIB must be semantically equivalent, except where objects or events are omitted because no translation is possible (use of Counter64).
Some machine readable information in SMIv2 will be converted into textual descriptions in SMIv1 during the translation process.
However, this loss of machine readable information is not considered to change the semantics of the MIB.
This document identifies a set of objects for monitoring the configuration and active characteristics of devices with APPN capabilities, and for controlling certain characteristics.
APPN is the aspect of Systems Network Architecture (SNA) that supports peer  to peer networking.
These networks transport both independent and dependent LU session traffic.
See the SNANAU APPC MIB [21] and the SNA NAU MIB [22] for management of these sessions.
See also RFC 2232, the DLUR MIB [23], and RFC 2238, the HPR MIB [24] for management of extensions to the APPN architecture.
In this document, we describe APPN managed objects.
An APPN network comprises various types of nodes, and transmission groups (TGs) that connect the nodes.
Network nodes (NNs) provide directory and routing functions for session establishment.
NNs may be session end points or intermediate nodes in a session.
A border node is a type of network node that connects networks together for session establishment without fully merging them.
A branch network node (BrNN) is a network node that is similar to a border node, but with only minimal functions to build a large APPN network within an enterprise.
Although a BrNN is defined to be a network node in the APPN architecture, it also has an end node (EN) appearance to upstream NNs in the network.
In this MIB module it is treated as a separate node type since it does not fit cleanly as an EN or NN, and this module explicity identifies those objects returned by a BrNN.
For example, a BrNN does not implement the appnNnTopo objects since it is the only node in its network topology table; but it does implement the appnSessIntermediate objects since it does have intermediate session support.
It also implements two of the appnEnUniqueCaps objects that could be useful to a management application.
A BrNN identifies itself as 'endNode' in the appnNodeType object but further identifies itself as a BrNN in the appnNodeBrNn object.
End nodes are session end points that receive directory and routing functions from network nodes, over control point to control point (CP CP) sessions.
Low entry networking (LEN) nodes are also session end points, but do not support CP CP sessions, and therefore need additional manual configuration definitions to establish sessions in an APPN network.
ENs and LEN nodes may have minimal directory and routing functions to establish control sessions (ENs) or to connect into the APPN network (LEN nodes).
Virtual routing nodes (VRNs) are not really nodes, but rather common definitions among actual nodes in a shared transport facility such as a local area network (LAN) that allow these actual nodes to temporarily establish a logical link with one another without defining each other's link level addressing information.
Ports and link stations are the node's interface to the data link control (DLC), which provides the physical transport, or to another protocol such as Data Link Switching (DLSw), which provides transport over an IP network.
See the SNADLC SDLC MIB[25], the SNADLC LLC MIB[26], and the DLSw MIB[27].
A link station uses a port to make a connection to another node.
This connection establishes a TG between the two nodes.
The directory and routing functions enable an NN to find where an LU is located in the network, and calculate the optimal route for the session based on the requested class of service (COS).
A network node saves the LU information in a directory database, which is built from LUs defined locally, LU registration from served end nodes, and LUs learned from network searches.
Each NN maintains a local COS database that assigns a routing weight, or relative cost, to each resource for each class of service.
For example, the #INTER COS assigns a lower weight to TGs with a greater effective capacity, while the #BATCH COS favors TGs with a lower relative cost per byte.
A node saves network topology information (on NNs, VRNs, and TGs between them) in a network topology database.
A node that supports APPN function set 1120, branch awareness, also saves information on TGs to adjacent BrNNs.
The topology information includes state and routing characteristics.
Topology information is exchanged between NNs over CP CP sessions such that the database is fully replicated at each NN.
Information on TGs to all node types are kept in a local topology database.
Local topology information is shared with other nodes only during the session establishment process, to give the NN responsible for route calculation the necessary information for end  to end route calculation.
A management application can show a full representation of the APPN network from the network and local topology information.
To show the network topology, the application need only query the network topology tables from a single NN.
To show all of the BrNNs, the application must also directly query all destinations of TGs that indicate they are branch TGs (indicated by the appnNnTgFRBranchTg object) to see if they have any cascaded BrNNs.
For any NNs that do not indicate branch awareness support (indicated by the appnNnNodeFRBranchAwareness object), the application must query each NN's appnLocalTgTable, and then the appnNodeBrNn object of each row's destination node to identify BrNNs.
To show all of the nodes in the network, including ENs and LEN nodes, the application must query every NN's appnLocalTgTable, and iteratively do the same for each BrNN it finds.
SNA names such as LU names, CP names, COS names, and mode names can be padded with blanks (space characters) in SNA formats.
For example, in a BIND Request Unit (RU)
a COS name of "#INTER" with a length of 6 is identical to a COS name of "#INTER  " with a length of 8.
However, in this MIB, nonsignificant blanks are not included by the agent.
Using the COS name from the previous example, an agent would return a length of 6 and the string "#INTER" with no blanks for appnCosName, regardless of how it appears in the BIND RU or in internal storage.
The MIB variables that this applies to are identified by a textual convention syntax that also describes this behavior.
When an SNA name is functioning as a table index, an agent treats trailing blanks as significant.
If a management station requests the objects from a row with index "
, the agent does not match this to the row with index "#INTER".
Since an agent has no nonsignificant blanks in any of its table indices, the only reason for a Management Station to include them would be to start GetNext processing at a chosen point in a table.
The SNA/APPN terms and overall architecture are documented in [18], [19], [20], and [28].
Monitoring of configuration parameters related to the node, ports, link stations, virtual routing nodes, and classes of service.
Monitoring of operational parameters related to ports, link stations, virtual routing nodes, topology, directory, and intermediate sessions.
Historical information about link station errors during connection establishment, or that caused the connection to terminate.
Traps for SNA Management Services
Monitoring and control of endpoint sessions.
Dependent LU Requester (DLUR) management.
High Performance Routing (HPR) management.
This MIB obsoletes RFC 2155 [29] with changes due to additions to the APPN architecture and some implementation experience of RFC 2155.
The changes from RFC 2155 are as follows:
New objects for the multi link TG architecture enhancement: appnLsMltgMember, appnNnTgFRMltgLinkType, appnLocalTgMltgLinkType, and appnLocalEnTgMltgLinkType.
New objects, and explanations for values for existing objects, for the branch network node architecture enhancement: appnNodeBrNn, appnNnNodeFRBranchAwareness, appnNnTgFRBranchTg, and appnLocalTgBranchLinkType.
New object, appnNodeLsCounterType, to indicate which type of ANR traffic is returned in the appnLsTable traffic counters.
appnNn   objects to represent the network nodes, virtual routing nodes, and TGs between these nodes that make up the APPN network topology database maintained in NNs.
appnLocalTopology  objects to represent nodes and TGs between nodes in the local topology database maintained in all nodes.
appnDir  objects related to LU location information from the node's directory database.
appnCos  objects related to classes of service information.
appnSessIntermediate objects related to intermediate sessions that pass through this node.
These groups are described below in more detail.
The appnNode group consists of the following tables and objects: 1) appnGeneralInfoAndCaps
This group of objects describes general information about the APPN node.
The type of information includes the node type and the time since this node was initialized.
This group of objects describes information specific to network nodes such as node routing characteristics.
This group of objects describes information specific to end nodes, with two objects that also apply to branch network nodes.
This group includes an object indicating the node's network node server.
This includes the appnPortTable, which describes the configuration and current status of the ports used by APPN, including the port state and DLC type.
This includes the appnNodeLsTable, which describes the configuration and current status of the link stations used by APPN, including the link state and port name; and the appnLsStatusTable, which provides information about errors this node encountered with connections to adjacent nodes, such as the sense data captured during connection failures.
It is a product option to decide how many appnLsStatusTable entries are kept.
appnVrnInfo This includes the appnVrnTable, which describes the relationship between virtual routing nodes' TGs described in the appnLocalTgTable with ports in the appnPortTable.
appnNn group The appnNn group consists of the following objects and tables 1) appnNnTopo
These objects contain general information about the network topology database including the number of nodes present, and the number of topology database updates (TDU) wars the node has detected.
This includes tables representing the APPN network topology database.
This includes the network nodes, virtual routing nodes, and TGs between these nodes, as well as the information about these resources carried in topology updates.
The tables are first indexed by the same flow reduction sequence number (FRSN) used in topology exchanges between NNs.
This allows a management station to retrieve only incremental updates, since the agent will update the FRSN of new or changed resources.
The appnLocalTopology group consists of the following objects and tables: 1) appnLocalThisNode a)
appnLocalGeneral Contains the local node and type.
These objects contain routing information about the local network node.
This table represents information about this node's local TGs.
This table represents TG information for EN TGs learned by the NN via TG registration with the local node.
The appnDir group consists of the following objects and tables: 1) appnDirPerf These objects represent information related to information about the directory database and directory searches involving this node.
This table represents the directory database, listing LUs known to this node, along with the owning node of the LU and the serving NN of the owning node.
The appnCos group consists of the following tables
This table represents the mode to class of service mapping.
This table represents the tranmission priority for each class of service.
This table represents the node row information for each class of service, including the weight of each node.
This table represents the TG row information for each class of service, including the weight of each TG.
The appnSessIntermediate group consists of the following objects and tables: 1)
These objects allow control of the collection of intermediate session information such as Route Selection Control Vectors (RSCVs) and counters.
appnIsInTable This table contains information on active intermediate sessions.
appnIsRtpTable This table contains information on active intermediate sessions that are being transported on Rapid Transport Protocol (RTP) connections by High Performance Routing (HPR).
One APPN trap is defined.
It is intended to correspond to SNA/MS Alerts, but is optional for a product to implement this trap.
The trap identifies the Alert ID number and, where possible, the affected resource.

TEXTUAL CONVENTION STATUS current DESCRIPTION
"An SNA Node Identification consists of two parts, which together comprise four bytes of hexadecimal data.
In SNA the Node Identification is transported in bytes 2 5 of the XID.
The block number is the first three digits of the Node Identification.
These 3 hexadecimal digits identify the product.
The ID number is the last 5 digits of the Node Identification.
These 5 hexadecimal digits are administratively defined and combined with the 3 digit block number form the 8 digit Node Identification.
A unique value is required for connections to SNA subarea.
In some implementations, the value 'bbb00000' (where 'bbb' represents a 3 digit block number) is returned to mean that the ID number is not unique on this node.
An SNA Node Identification is represented as eight ASCII encoded hexadecimal digits, using the characters '0' '9' and 'A' 'F'.

This group is used to represent the entire APPN network node topology   including network nodes, virtual routing nodes and all TGs associated   with these nodes, including intersubnetwork TGs (ISTGs) and branch TGs.
The APPN topology database consists of information about every APPN   network node in this network node's topology subnetwork.
This   information is learned over time as each network node exchanges   topology information with the network nodes adjacent to it.
The   database consists of information about each node, and information   about all of the transmission groups used by these nodes.
Information about virtual routing nodes (representing connection   networks) is treated in the same way as information about network   nodes, and is replicated at each network node.
The FRSN, node name,   and node type are the only meaningful fields for a virtual routing   node.
The other node objects return unspecified values.
Each   node that has defined a TG with this virtual routing node as the   destination also defines a TG on this virtual routing node.
There   is a TG record for each node that uses this virtual routing node.
The APPN node table represents node information from the APPN topology   database, with the FRSN and APPN fully qualified CP name serving as   the index.
The FRSN is the agent's relative time stamp of an update   to the network topology database.
After collecting the entire database   once, a management application can issue GET
NEXT commands starting   from the last rows it has retrieved from the appnNnTopologyFRTable and   from the appnNnTgTopologyFRTable.
When the response to either of these
NEXT commands returns another row of its respective table, this   indicates a change to the agent's topology database.
The management   application can then retrieve only the updates to the table, using
GET NEXT commands starting from the last retrieved node or TG entry.
Due to SNMP's ASN.1 limitations, we cannot represent the TG table   within the node table in this way.
We define separate tables for   nodes and TGs, adding the node name to each TG entry to provide a   means of correlating the TG with its originating node.

Implementations that support this object save in their directory database information about an LU's owning control point that was communicated in two control vectors:  an Associated Resource Entry (X'3C') CV with resource type
(ENCP)  a Real Owning Control Point (X'4A') CV.
The X'4A' CV is created by a branch network node to preserve the name of the real owning control point for an LU below the branch network node, before it overwrites this name with its own name in the X'3C' CV.
The X'4A' CV is not present for LUs that are not below branch network nodes.
If the information a node has about an LU's owning CP came only in a X'3C' CV, then the name from the X'3C' is returned in the appnDirLuOwnerName object, and a null string is returned in this object.
If the information a node has about an LU's owning CP came in both X'3C' and X'4A' CVs
, then the name from the X'4A' is returned in the appnDirLuOwnerName object, and the name from the X'3C' (which will be the branch network node's name) is returned in this object."
The APPN Class of Service (COS)
Class of Service is a means of expressing the quality of routes and   the transmission priority of traffic that flows on these routes.
The quality of routes is specified by two tables, a COS weight table   for TGs and a COS weight table for nodes.
Values in these COS tables   are administratively assigned at each APPN node, with seven default   tables specified by the APPN architecture.

"The appnLocalEnTopoConfGroup is mandatory only for network nodes.
Certain management information defined in this MIB may be considered sensitive in some network environments.
Therefore, authentication of received SNMP requests and controlled access to management information SHOULD be employed in such environments.
An authentication protocol is defined in [12].
A protocol for access control is defined in [15].
appnNnTgFRSecurity, appnLocalTgSecurity, appnLocalEnTgSecurity, appnCosTgRowSecurityMin, and appnCosTgRowSecurityMax can be used to determine the potential path of secure data.
While these objects cannot be changed by a management application using this MIB, these objects could be used to determine where a security exposure exists due to an improper configuration on the agent.
None of the other read only objects in the APPN MIB reports a password, user data, or anything else that is particularly sensitive.
Some enterprises view their network configuration itself, as well as information about network usage and performance, as corporate assets; such enterprises may wish to restrict SNMP access to most of the objects in the MIB.
Four of the read write objects in the MIB can affect network operations; it is recommended that SNMP access to these objects be restricted.
These two objects allow an APPN port or link station to be activated, deactivated, or recycled via an SNMP operation.
The latter two operations may disrupt current users of the network.
Setting this object to 'inactive' causes an active SNA session to be deactivated.
Other read write objects control the gathering of network management data;
controlling access to these objects is less critical.
