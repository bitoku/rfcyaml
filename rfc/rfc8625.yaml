  - "1.  Introduction\n   The RSVP-TE specification [RFC3209] and GMPLS extensions
    [RFC3473]\n   specify the signaling message, including the bandwidth request for\n
    \  setting up an LSP in a packet-switching network.\n   Some data communication
    technologies allow a seamless change of the\n   maximum physical bandwidth through
    a set of known discrete values.\n   The parameter availability [G.827] [F.1703]
    [P.530] is often used to\n   describe the link capacity during network planning.
    \ The availability\n   is based on a time scale, which is a proportion of the
    operating time\n   that the requested bandwidth is ensured.  A more detailed example
    of\n   bandwidth availability can be found in Appendix A.  Assigning\n   different
    bandwidth availability classes to different types of\n   services over links with
    variable discrete bandwidth provides for a\n   more efficient planning of link
    capacity.  To set up an LSP across\n   these links, bandwidth availability information
    is required for the\n   nodes to verify bandwidth satisfaction and make a bandwidth\n
    \  reservation.  The bandwidth availability information should be\n   inherited
    from the bandwidth availability requirements of the\n   services expected to be
    carried on the LSP.  For example, voice\n   service usually needs 99.999% bandwidth
    availability, while non-real-\n   time services may adequately perform at 99.99%
    or 99.9% bandwidth\n   availability.  Since different service types may need different\n
    \  availability guarantees, multiple <availability, bandwidth> pairs may\n   be
    required when signaling.\n   If the bandwidth availability requirement is not
    specified in the\n   signaling message, the bandwidth will likely be reserved
    as the\n   highest bandwidth availability.  Suppose, for example, the bandwidth\n
    \  with 99.999% availability of a link is 100 Mbps, and the bandwidth\n   with
    99.99% availability is 200 Mbps.  When a video application makes\n   a request
    for 120 Mbps without a bandwidth availability requirement,\n   the system will
    consider the request as 120 Mbps with 99.999%\n   bandwidth availability, while
    the available bandwidth with 99.999%\n   bandwidth availability is only 100 Mbps.
    \ Therefore, the LSP path\n   cannot be set up.  However, the video application
    doesn't need\n   99.999% bandwidth availability; 99.99% bandwidth availability
    is\n   enough.  In this case, the LSP could be set up if the bandwidth\n   availability
    is also specified in the signaling message.\n   To fulfill an LSP setup by signaling
    in these scenarios, this\n   document specifies a Bandwidth Availability TLV.
    \ The Bandwidth\n   Availability TLV can be applicable to any kind of physical
    link with\n   variable discrete bandwidth, such as microwave or DSL.  Multiple\n
    \  Bandwidth Availability TLVs, together with multiple Ethernet\n   Bandwidth
    Profile TLVs, can be carried by the Ethernet SENDER_TSPEC\n   object [RFC6003].
    \ Since the Ethernet FLOWSPEC object has the same\n   format as the Ethernet SENDER_TSPEC
    object [RFC6003], the Bandwidth\n   Availability TLV can also be carried by the
    Ethernet FLOWSPEC object.\n"

  - "2.  Overview\n   A tunnel in a packet-switching network may span one or more
    links in\n   a network.  To set up an LSP, a node may collect link information\n
    \  that is advertised in a routing message (e.g., an OSPF TE LSA\n   message)
    by network nodes to obtain network topology information, and\n   it can then calculate
    an LSP route based on the network topology.\n   The calculated LSP route is signaled
    using a PATH/RESV message to set\n   up the LSP.\n   If a network contains one
    or more links with variable discrete\n   bandwidths, a <bandwidth, availability>
    requirement list should be\n   specified for an LSP at setup.  Each <bandwidth,
    availability> pair\n   in the list means the listed bandwidth with specified availability
    is\n   required.  The list can be derived from the results of service\n   planning
    for the LSP.\n   A node that has link(s) with variable discrete bandwidth attached\n
    \  should contain a <bandwidth, availability> information list in its\n   OSPF
    TE LSA messages.  The list provides the mapping between the link\n   nominal bandwidth
    and its availability level.  This information can\n   then be used for path calculation
    by the node(s).  The routing\n   extension for availability can be found in [RFC8330].\n
    \  When a node initiates a PATH/RESV signaling to set up an LSP, the\n   PATH
    message should carry the <bandwidth, availability> requirement\n   list as a bandwidth
    request.  Intermediate node(s) will allocate the\n   bandwidth resources for each
    availability requirement from the\n   remaining bandwidth with the corresponding
    availability.  An error\n   message may be returned if any <bandwidth, availability>
    request\n   cannot be satisfied.\n"

      expressed as one of the following\n   values: 0.99, 0.999, 0.9999, or 0.99999.
      \ The IEEE floating-point\n   number is used here to align with [RFC8330].  When
      representing\n   values higher than 0.999999, the floating-point number starts
      to\n   introduce errors to intended precision.  However, in reality, 0.99999\n
      \  is normally considered the highest availability value (which results\n   in
      5 minutes of outage in a year) in a telecom network.  Therefore,\n   the use
      of a floating-point number for availability is acceptable.\n"
    title: 3.1.  Bandwidth Availability TLV
  - contents:
    - "3.2.  Signaling Process\n   The source node initiates a PATH message, which
      may carry a number of\n   bandwidth requests, including one or more Ethernet
      Bandwidth Profile\n   TLVs and one or more Bandwidth Availability TLVs.  Each
      Ethernet\n   Bandwidth Profile TLV corresponds to an availability parameter
      in the\n   associated Bandwidth Availability TLV.\n   When the intermediate
      and destination nodes receive the PATH message,\n   the nodes compare the requested
      bandwidth under each availability\n   level in the SENDER_TSPEC objects, with
      the remaining link bandwidth\n   resources under a corresponding availability
      level on a local link,\n   to check if they can meet the bandwidth requirements.\n
      \  o  When all <bandwidth, availability> requirement requests can be\n      satisfied
      (that is, the requested bandwidth under each\n      availability parameter is
      smaller than or equal to the remaining\n      bandwidth under the corresponding
      availability parameter on its\n      local link), the node SHOULD reserve the
      bandwidth resources from\n      each remaining sub-bandwidth portion on its
      local link to set up\n      this LSP.  Optionally, a higher availability bandwidth
      can be\n      allocated to a lower availability request when the lower\n      availability
      bandwidth cannot satisfy the request.\n   o  When at least one <bandwidth, availability>
      requirement request\n      cannot be satisfied, the node SHOULD generate a PathErr
      message\n      with the error code \"Admission Control Error\" and the error
      value\n      \"Requested Bandwidth Unavailable\" (see [RFC2205]).\n   When two
      LSPs request bandwidth with the same availability\n   requirement, the contention
      MUST be resolved by comparing the node\n   IDs, where the LSP with the higher
      node ID is assigned the\n   reservation.  This is consistent with the general
      contention\n   resolution mechanism provided in Section 4.2 of [RFC3471].\n
      \  When a node does not support the Bandwidth Availability TLV, the node\n   should
      send a PathErr message with error code \"Unknown Attributes\n   TLV\", as specified
      in [RFC5420].  An LSP could also be set up in this\n   case if there's enough
      bandwidth (note that the availability level of\n   the reserved bandwidth is
      unknown).  When a node receives Bandwidth\n   Availability TLVs with a mix of
      zero and non-zero indexes, the\n   message MUST be ignored and MUST NOT be propagated.
      \ When a node\n   receives Bandwidth Availability TLVs (non-zero index) with
      no\n   matching index value among the Ethernet Bandwidth Profile TLVs, the\n
      \  message MUST be ignored and MUST NOT be propagated.  When a node\n   receives
      several <bandwidth, availability> pairs, but there are extra\n   Ethernet Bandwidth
      Profile TLVs that do not match the index of any\n   Bandwidth Availability TLV,
      the extra Ethernet Bandwidth Profile TLVs\n   MUST be ignored and MUST NOT be
      propagated.\n"

  - "Appendix A.  Bandwidth Availability Example\n   In mobile backhaul networks,
    microwave links are very popular for\n   providing connections of last hops.  To
    maintain link connectivity in\n   heavy rain conditions, the microwave link may
    lower the modulation\n   level since moving to a lower modulation level provides
    for a lower\n   SNR requirement.  This is called \"adaptive modulation\" technology\n
    \  [EN-302-217].  However, a lower modulation level also means a lower\n   link
    bandwidth.  When a link bandwidth is reduced because of\n   modulation downshifting,
    high-priority traffic can be maintained,\n   while lower-priority traffic is dropped.
    \ Similarly, copper links may\n   change their link bandwidth due to external
    interference.\n   Presume that a link has three discrete bandwidth levels:\n   o
    \ The link bandwidth under modulation level 1 (e.g., QPSK) is 100\n      Mbps.\n
    \  o  The link bandwidth under modulation level 2 (e.g., 16QAM) is 200\n      Mbps.\n
    \  o  The link bandwidth under modulation level 3 (e.g., 256QAM) is 400\n      Mbps.\n
    \  On a sunny day, modulation level 3 can be used to achieve a 400 Mbps\n   link
    bandwidth.\n   Light rain with a X mm/h rate triggers the system to change the\n
    \  modulation level from level 3 to level 2, with the bandwidth changing\n   from
    400 Mbps to 200 Mbps.  The probability of X mm/h rain in the\n   local area is
    52 minutes in a year.  Then the dropped 200 Mbps\n   bandwidth has 99.99% availability.\n
    \  Heavy rain with a Y(Y>X) mm/h rate triggers the system to change the\n   modulation
    level from level 2 to level 1, with the bandwidth changing\n   from 200 Mbps to
    100 Mbps.  The probability of Y mm/h rain in the\n   local area is 26 minutes
    in a year.  Then the dropped 100 Mbps\n   bandwidth has 99.995% availability.\n
    \  For the 100 Mbps bandwidth of modulation level 1, only extreme\n   weather
    conditions can cause the whole system to be unavailable,\n   which only happens
    for 5 minutes in a year.  So the 100 Mbps\n   bandwidth of the modulation level
    1 owns the availability of 99.999%.\n   There are discrete buckets per availability
    level.  Under the worst\n   weather conditions, there's only 100 Mbps capacity,
    which is 99.999%\n   available.  It's treated effectively as \"always available\"
    since\n   better availability is not possible.  If the weather is bad but not\n
    \  the worst possible conditions, modulation level 2 can be used, which\n   gets
    an additional 100 Mbps bandwidth (i.e., 200 Mbps total).\n   Therefore, 100 Mbps
    is in the 99.999% bucket, and 100 Mbps is in the\n   99.995% bucket.  In clear
    weather, modulation level 3 can be used to\n   get 400 Mbps total, but that's
    only 200 Mbps more than at modulation\n   level 2, so the 99.99% bucket has that
    \"extra\" 200 Mbps, and the\n   other two buckets still have 100 Mbps each.\n
    \  Therefore, the maximum bandwidth is 400 Mbps.  The sub-bandwidth and\n   its
    availability according to the weather conditions are shown as\n   follows:\n      Sub-bandwidth
    (Mbps)   Availability\n      ------------------     ------------\n      200                    99.99%\n
    \     100                    99.995%\n      100                    99.999%\n"
