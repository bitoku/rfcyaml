  - "make a new suggestions and pick a few nits.\n   1.  In my humble opinion, the\
    \  command  verb  \"BYE\"  is  overly\n       cute; I would find \"QUIT\" much\
    \ less offensive\n   2.  The \"(pathname)\" syntax (p.5) may need some reworking.\n\
    \       It would be very desirable for all protocols or Network\n       access\
    \ programs to use the same syntax for selecting a\n       host and socket and/or\
    \ file name.  (Note that the FTP\n       documents use the term \"pathname\" in\
    \ the more\n       restricted sense of a local file system name.)\n       a. \
    \ The PORT construction seems very undesirable,\n           since it depends upon\
    \ a particular bit convention\n           of TIP's.  TIP's have bent Network protocols\
    \ rather\n           badly in the past, but surely we don't want to build\n  \
    \         their particular socket system into an official\n           protocol.\n\
    \       b.  For convenience, it may be desirable to allow hex\n           and\
    \ octal socket numbers.\n       c.  There will probably be other hosts besides\
    \ TIP's which\n           will use the \"(host-socket)\" pathname, and some of\n\
    \           them may want a transmission attribute other than \"T\".\n       \
    \    The proposed syntax should be changed to allow (attributes)\n           in\
    \ (host-socket)\n       d.  I see no reason to exclude attribute \"TE\", since\
    \ the control\n           characters cr, lf, and ff exist in EBCDIC as well as\
    \ ASCII.\n       e.  There are many EBCDIC codes, and at least 2 ASCII's.  The\n\
    \           (code) construction needs expansion.\n   4.  It may be desirable to\
    \ distinguish syntactically (job-id)\n       and job-file-id).  For example, this\
    \ would allow the command\n            ABORT (job-file-id)\n       to abort the\
    \ job currently being transmitted, regardless of\n       its id (this assumes\
    \ that multiple jobs for a given user\n       are sent sequentially).\n   5. \
    \ The replies presented in the document are very good, but may\n       need some\
    \ elaboration.  For example, the syntax error messages\n       should be more\
    \ specific.  When the user enters:\n            OUT=(H) UCLA91: NE/ARP998.WGW.TEST\n\
    \       he would like the error message to indicate explicitly that\n       the\
    \ hostname is not valid, rather than merely being told there\n       is something\
    \ wrong with one of the parameters.\n   6.  Experience with remote job entry to\
    \ CCN via the Network has\n       shown that the user wants a transmission status\
    \ command, to\n       find out how many records have been sent or received so\
    \ far.\n       The network bandwidth corresponds in order of magnitude to\n  \
    \     one page per second.  The average output for jobs submitted\n       to CCN\
    \ from the Network has contained about 30 pages, so\n       significant transmission\
    \ delays are not unusual.  It is important\n       to add a command for this purpose.\n\
