    \ following, the terms Optical channel Data Unit-j (ODUj) and\n   Optical channel\
    \ Data Unit-k (ODUk) are used in a multiplexing\n   scenario to identify the lower\
    \ order signal (ODUj) and the higher\n   order signal (ODUk).  How an ODUk connection\
    \ service is transported\n   within an operator network is governed by operator\
    \ policy.  For\n   example, the ODUk connection service might be transported over\
    \ an\n   ODUk path over an Optical channel Transport Unit-k (OTUk) section,\n\
    \   with the same path and section rates as that of the connection\n   service\
    \ (see Figure 1).  In this case, an entire lambda of capacity\n   is consumed\
    \ in transporting the ODUk connection service.  On the\n   other hand, the operator\
    \ might exploit different multiplexing\n   capabilities in the network to improve\
    \ infrastructure efficiencies\n   within any given networking domain.  In this\
    \ case, ODUk multiplexing\n   may be performed prior to transport over various\
    \ rate ODU servers (as\n   per Figure 2) over associated OTU sections.\n   From\
    \ the perspective of multiplexing relationships, a given ODUk may\n   play different\
    \ roles as it traverses various networking domains.\n   As detailed in [RFC7062],\
    \ client ODUk connection services can be\n   transported over:\n   Case A:  one\
    \ or more wavelength subnetworks connected by optical\n            links, or\n\
    \   Case B:  one or more ODU links (having sub-lambda and/or lambda\n        \
    \    bandwidth granularity), or\n   Case C:  a mix of ODU links and wavelength\
    \ subnetworks.\n   This document considers the Traffic Engineering (TE) information\n\
    \   needed for ODU path computation and the parameters needed to be\n   signaled\
    \ for Label Switched Path (LSP) setup.\n   The following sections list and analyze\
    \ what GMPLS already has and\n   what it is missing with regard to each type of\
    \ data that needs to be\n   advertised and signaled.\n"

- title: 3.1.1.  Payload Type and TS Granularity Relationship
  contents:
  - "3.1.1.  Payload Type and TS Granularity Relationship\n   As defined in G.709,\
    \ an ODUk container consists of an Optical channel\n   Payload Unit-k (OPUk) plus\
    \ a specific ODUk Overhead (OH).  OPUk OH\n   information is added to the OPUk\
    \ information payload to create an\n   OPUk.  It includes information to support\
    \ the adaptation of client\n   signals.  Within the OPUk overhead, there is the\
    \ payload structure\n   identifier (PSI) that includes the payload type (PT).\
    \  The PT is used\n   to indicate the composition of the OPUk signal.  When an\
    \ ODUj signal\n   is multiplexed into an ODUk, the ODUj signal is first extended\
    \ with\n   the frame alignment overhead and then mapped into an Optical channel\n\
    \   Data Tributary Unit (ODTU).  Two different types of ODTUs are\n   defined:\n\
    \   o  ODTUjk ((j,k) = {(0,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,3)}; ODTU01, ODTU12,\n      ODTU13,\
    \ and ODTU23) in which an ODUj signal is mapped via the\n      Asynchronous Mapping\
    \ Procedure (AMP), as defined in Section 19.5\n      of [G.709-2012].\n   o  ODTUk.ts\
    \ ((k,ts) = (2,1..8), (3,1..32), (4,1..80)) in which a\n      lower order ODU\
    \ (ODU0, ODU1, ODU2, ODU2e, ODU3, and ODUflex)\n      signal is mapped via the\
    \ Generic Mapping Procedure (GMP), as\n      defined in Section 19.6 of [G.709-2012].\n\
    \   G.709 also introduces a logical entity, called Optical channel Data\n   Tributary\
    \ Unit Group (ODTUGk), characterizing the multiplexing of the\n   various ODTU.\
    \  The ODTUGk is then mapped into OPUk.  Optical channel\n   Data Tributary Unit\
    \ j into k (ODTUjk) and Optical channel Data\n   Tributary Unit k with ts tributary\
    \ slots (ODTUk.ts) are directly\n   time-division multiplexed into the tributary\
    \ slots of an OH OPUk.\n   When PT is assuming values 0x20 or 0x21, together with\
    \ OPUk type\n   (k=1, 2, 3, 4), it is used to discriminate two different ODU\n\
    \   multiplex structures for ODTUGx:\n   o  Value 0x20: supporting ODTUjk only\n\
    \   o  Value 0x21: supporting ODTUk.ts or ODTUk.ts and ODTUjk\n   The distinction\
    \ is needed for OPUk with k=2 or 3 since OPU2 and OPU3\n   are able to support\
    \ both the different ODU multiplex structures.  For\n   OPU4 and OPU1, only one\
    \ type of ODTUG is supported: ODTUG4 with\n   PT=0x21 and ODTUG1 with PT=0x20\
    \ (see Figure 6).  The relationship\n   between PT and TS granularity is due to\
    \ the fact that the two\n   different ODTUGk types discriminated by PT and OPUk\
    \ are characterized\n   by two different TS granularities of the related OPUk,\
    \ the former at\n   2.5 Gbit/s and the latter at 1.25 Gbit/s.\n   In order to\
    \ complete the picture, in the PSI OH, there is also the\n   Multiplex Structure\
    \ Identifier (MSI) that provides the information on\n   which tributary slots\
    \ of the different ODTUjk or ODTUk.ts are mapped\n   into the related OPUk.  The\
    \ following figure shows how the client\n   traffic is multiplexed till the OPUk\

- title: 3.1.2.  Fallback Procedure
  contents:
  - "3.1.2.  Fallback Procedure\n   G.798 [G.798] describes the so-called PT=0x21-to-PT=0x20\
    \ interworking\n   process that explains how two nodes with interfaces that have\n\
    \   different payload types and, hence, different TS granularity (1.25\n   Gbit/s\
    \ vs. 2.5 Gbit/s), can be coordinated to permit the equipment\n   with 1.25 Gbit/s\
    \ TS granularity to adapt the TS allocation according\n   to the different TS\
    \ granularity (2.5 Gbit/s) of a neighbor.\n   Therefore, in order to let the Network\
    \ Element (NE) change TS\n   granularity accordingly to the neighbor requirements,\
    \ the\n   AUTOpayloadtype [G.798] needs to be set.  When both the neighbors\n\
    \   (link or trail) have been configured as structured, the payload type\n   received\
    \ in the overhead is compared to the transmitted PT.  If they\n   are different\
    \ and the transmitted one is PT=0x21, the node must fall\n   back to PT=0x20.\
    \  In this case, the fallback process makes the system\n   self-consistent, and\
    \ the only reason for signaling the TS granularity\n   is to provide the correct\
    \ label (i.e., the label for PT=0x21 has\n   twice the TS number of PT=0x20).\
    \  On the other side, if the\n   AUTOpayloadtype is not configured, the Resource\
    \ Reservation Protocol-\n   Traffic Engineering (RSVP-TE) consequent actions need\
    \ to be defined\n   in case of a TS mismatch.\n"

  - "3.2.  Control-Plane Considerations\n   When setting up an ODUj over an ODUk,\

    \ (H-LSP)\n         Figure 4: Client-Server TS Granularity Example\n   In this\
    \ scenario, an ODU3 LSP is set up from nodes B to Z.  Node B\n   has an old interface\
    \ that is able to support 2.5 Gbit/s TS\n   granularity; hence, only client TS\
    \ granularity equal to 2.5 Gbit/s\n   can be exported to ODU3 H-LSP-possible clients.\
    \  An ODU2 LSP is set\n   up from nodes A to Z with client TS granularity 1.25\
    \ Gbit/s signaled\n   and exported towards clients.  The ODU2 LSP is carried by\
    \ ODU3 H-LSP\n   from nodes B to Z.  Due to the limitations of the old node B\n\
    \   interface, the ODU2 LSP is mapped with 2.5 Gbit/s TS granularity over\n  \
    \ the ODU3 H-LSP.  Then, an ODU1 LSP is set up from nodes A to Z, which\n   is\
    \ carried by the ODU2 H-LSP and mapped over it using 1.25 Gbit/s TS\n   granularity.\n\
    \   What is shown in the example is that the TS granularity processing is\n  \
    \ a per-layer issue: even if the ODU3 H-LSP is created with the TS\n   granularity\
    \ client at 2.5 Gbit/s, the ODU2 H-LSP must guarantee a\n   1.25 Gbit/s TS granularity\
    \ client.  The ODU3 H-LSP is eligible from\n   an ODU2 LSP perspective since it\
    \ is known from the routing that this\n   ODU3 interface at node Z supports an\
    \ ODU2 termination exporting a TS\n   granularity at 1.25 Gbit/s / 2.5 Gbit/s.\n\
    \   The TS granularity information is needed in the routing protocol as\n   the\
    \ ingress node (A in the previous example) needs to know if the\n   interfaces\
    \ at the last hop can support the required TS granularity.\n   In case they cannot,\
    \ A will compute an alternate path from itself to\n   Z (see Figure 4).\n   Moreover,\
    \ TS granularity information also needs to be signaled.  As\n   an example, consider\
    \ the setup of an ODU3 forwarding adjacency that\n   is going to carry an ODU0;\
    \ hence, the support of 1.25 Gbit/s TS is\n   needed.  The information related\
    \ to the TS granularity has to be\n   carried in the signaling to permit node\
    \ C (see Figure 5) to choose\n   the right one among the different interfaces\
    \ (with different TS\n   granularities) towards D.  In case the full Explicit\
    \ Route Object\n   (ERO) is provided in the signaling with explicit interface\n\
    \   declaration, there is no need for C to choose the right interface\n   towards\
    \ D as it has been already decided by the ingress node or by\n   the Path Computation\
    \ Element (PCE).\n                                ODU3\n                     \

    \ in Signaling\n   In case an ODUk FA_LSP needs to be set up as nesting another\
    \ ODUj (as\n   depicted in Figure 5), there might be the need to know the hierarchy\n\
    \   of nested LSPs in addition to TS granularity to permit the\n   penultimate\
    \ hop (i.e., C) to choose the correct interface towards the\n   egress node or\
    \ any intermediate node (i.e., B) to choose the right\n   path when performing\
    \ the ERO expansion.  This is not needed in case\n   we allow bundling only component\
    \ links with homogeneous hierarchies.\n   In the case in which a specific implementation\
    \ does not specify the\n   last hop interface in the ERO, crankback can be a solution.\n\
    \   In a multi-stage multiplexing environment, any layer can have a\n   different\
    \ TS granularity structure; for example, in a multiplexing\n   hierarchy such\
    \ as ODU0->ODU2->ODU3, the ODU3 can be structured at TS\n   granularity = 2.5\
    \ Gbit/s in order to support an ODU2 connection, but\n   this ODU2 connection\
    \ can be a tunnel for ODU0 and, hence, structured\n   with 1.25 Gbit/s TS granularity.\
    \  Therefore, any multiplexing level\n   has to advertise its TS granularity capabilities\
    \ in order to allow a\n   correct path computation by the end nodes (both the\
    \ ODUk trail and\n   the H-LSP/FA).\n   The following table shows the different\
    \ mapping possibilities\n   depending on the TS granularity types.  The client\
    \ types are shown in\n   the left column, while the different OPUk server and\
    \ related TS\n   granularities are listed in the top row.  The table also shows\
    \ the\n   relationship between the TS granularity and the payload type.\n    \

- title: 5.  Signal Type
  contents:
  - "5.  Signal Type\n   From a routing perspective, GMPLS OSPF [RFC4203] and GMPLS\
    \ IS-IS\n   [RFC5307] only allow advertising interfaces [RFC4328] (the single\
    \ TS\n   type) without the capability of providing precise information about\n\
    \   bandwidth-specific allocation.  For example, in case of link\n   bundling,\
    \ when dividing the unreserved bandwidth by the MAX LSP\n   bandwidth, it is not\
    \ possible to know the exact number of LSPs at MAX\n   LSP bandwidth size that\
    \ can be set up (see the example in Figure 3).\n   The lack of spatial allocation\
    \ heavily impacts the restoration\n   process because the lack of information\
    \ on free resources highly\n   increases the number of crankbacks affecting network\
    \ convergence\n   time.\n   Moreover, actual tools provided by [RFC4203] and [RFC5307]\
    \ only allow\n   advertising signal types with fixed bandwidth and implicit hierarchy\n\
    \   (e.g., Synchronous Digital Hierarchy (SDH) networks / Synchronous\n   Optical\
    \ Networks (SONETs)) or variable bandwidth with no hierarchy\n   (e.g., packet\
    \ switching networks); but, they do not provide the means\n   for advertising\
    \ networks with a mixed approach (e.g., ODUflex\n   Constant Bit Rate (CBR) and\
    \ ODUflex packet).\n   For example, when advertising ODU0 as MIN LSP bandwidth\
    \ and ODU4 as\n   MAX LSP bandwidth, it is not possible to state whether the advertised\n\
    \   link supports ODU4 and ODUflex or ODU4, ODU3, ODU2, ODU1, ODU0, and\n   ODUflex.\
    \  Such ambiguity is not present in SDH networks where the\n   hierarchy is implicit\
    \ and flexible containers like ODUflex do not\n   exist.  The issue could be resolved\
    \ by declaring 1 Interface\n   Switching Capability Descriptor (ISCD) for each\
    \ signal type actually\n   supported by the link.\n   Suppose, for example, there\
    \ is an equivalent ODU2 unreserved\n   bandwidth in a TE link (with bundling capability)\
    \ distributed on 4\n   ODU1; it would be advertised via the ISCD in this way:\n\
    \      MAX LSP Bandwidth: ODU1\n      MIN LSP Bandwidth: ODU1\n      - Maximum\
    \ Reservable Bandwidth (of the bundle) set to ODU2\n      - Unreserved Bandwidth\
    \ (of the bundle) set to ODU2\n   In conclusion, the routing extensions defined\
    \ in [RFC4203] and\n   [RFC5307] require a different ISCD per signal type in order\
    \ to\n   advertise each supported container.  This motivates an attempt to\n \
    \  look for a more optimized solution without proliferation of the\n   number\
    \ of ISCDs advertised.\n   Per [RFC2328], OSPF messages are directly encapsulated\
    \ in IP\n   datagrams and depend on IP fragmentation when transmitting packets\n\
    \   larger than the network's MTU.  [RFC2328] recommends that \"IP\n   fragmentation\
    \ should be avoided whenever possible\".  This\n   recommendation further constrains\
    \ solutions since OSPF does not\n   support any generic mechanism to fragment\
    \ OSPF Link State\n   Advertisements (LSAs).  Even when used in IP environments,\
    \ IS-IS\n   [RFC1195] does not support message sizes larger than a link's maximum\n\
    \   frame size.\n   With respect to link bundling [RFC4201], the utilization of\
    \ the ISCD\n   as it is would not allow precise advertising of spatial bandwidth\n\
    \   allocation information unless using only one component link per TE\n   link.\n\
    \   On the other hand, from a signaling point of view, [RFC4328]\n   describes\
    \ GMPLS signaling extensions to support the control of G.709\n   OTNs defined\
    \ before 2011 [G.709-2001].  However, [RFC4328] needs to\n   be updated because\
    \ it does not provide the means to signal all the\n   new signal types and related\
    \ mapping and multiplexing\n   functionalities.\n"

  contents:
  - "10.  Priority Support\n   [RFC4202] defines eight priorities for resource availability\
    \ and\n   usage.  As defined, each is advertised independent of the number of\n\
    \   priorities supported by a network, and even unsupported priorities\n   are\
    \ included.  As is the case in Section 8, addressing any\n   inefficiency with\
    \ such advertisements is not required to support\n   OTNs.  But, any such inefficiency\
    \ should also be considered as part\n   of the optimization effort identified\
    \ in Section 5.\n"
- title: 11.  Multi-stage Multiplexing
  contents:
  - "11.  Multi-stage Multiplexing\n   With reference to [RFC7062], the introduction\
    \ of multi-stage\n   multiplexing implies the advertisement of cascaded adaptation\n\
    \   capabilities together with the matrix access constraints.  The\n   structure\
    \ defined by the IETF for the advertisement of adaptation\n   capabilities is\
    \ the Interface Adaptation Capability Descriptor\n   (IACD), as defined in [RFC6001].\n\
    \   With respect to routing, please note that in case of multi-stage\n   multiplexing\
    \ hierarchy (e.g., ODU1->ODU2->ODU3), not only the ODUk/\n   OTUk bandwidth (ODU3)\
    \ and service-layer bandwidth (ODU1) are needed\n   but also the intermediate\
    \ one (ODU2).  This is a typical case of a\n   spatial allocation problem.\n \
    \  In this scenario, suppose the following advertisement:\n      Hierarchy: ODU1->ODU2->ODU3\n\
    \      Number of ODU1==5\n   The number of ODU1 suggests that it is possible to\
    \ have an ODU2 FA,\n   but it depends on the spatial allocation of such ODU1s.\n\
    \   It is possible that two links are bundled together and three\n   ODU1->ODU2->ODU3\
    \ are available on a component link and two on the\n   other one; in such a case,\
    \ the ODU2 FA could not be set up.  The\n   advertisement of the ODU2 is needed\
    \ because in case of ODU1 spatial\n   allocation (3+2), the ODU2 available bandwidth\
    \ would be 0 (ODU2 FA\n   cannot be created), while in case of ODU1 spatial allocation\
    \ (4+1),\n   the ODU2 available bandwidth would be 1 (1 ODU2 FA can be created).\n\
    \   The information stated above implies augmenting both the ISCD and the\n  \
    \ IACD.\n"
- title: 12.  Generalized Label
  contents:
  - "12.  Generalized Label\n   The ODUk label format defined in [RFC4328] could be\
    \ updated to\n   support new signal types as defined in [G.709-2012], but it would\
    \ be\n   difficult to further enhance it to support possible new signal types.\n\
    \   Furthermore, such a label format may have scalability issues due to\n   the\
    \ high number of labels needed when signaling large LSPs.  For\n   example, when\
    \ an ODU3 is mapped into an ODU4 with 1.25 Gbit/s\n   tributary slots, it would\
    \ require the utilization of 31 labels\n   (31*4*8=992 bits) to be allocated,\
    \ while an ODUflex into an ODU4 may\n   need up to 80 labels (80*4*8=2560 bits).\n\
    \   A new flexible and scalable ODUk label format needs to be defined.\n"
