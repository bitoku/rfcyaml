  - "                   CONNECTING COMPUTERS TO MLC PORTS\n        Several times we\
    \ have been asked if computers can be con- nected\n   through serial communication\
    \ lines to ports on the Terminal IMP's\n   Multi-Line Controller (MLC) [related\
    \ questions about the level of\n   software support provided by the Terminal IMP\
    \ to such a connection,\n   have also been raised].  In the past we have said,\
    \ \"Please don't!\" We\n   now say, \"Sure, but will that really help you the\
    \ way you think it\n   will?\"\n        (1) Connections between computers and\
    \ IMPs (i.e., the Host\n   interfaces) have been assumed to be error-free.  This\
    \ assumption is\n   justifiable on the basis that the IMP and Host computers were\n\
    \   expected to be either in the same room (up to 30 feet of cable) or,\n   via\
    \ the Distant Host option, within 2000 feet on well- controlled,\n   shielded\
    \ cables.  A connection through common carrier facilities is\n   not comparably\
    \ free of errors.  Usage of common- carrier lines for\n   connecting a terminal\
    \ to an IMP, including the assumption of a human\n   at the terminal, is a situation\
    \ in which the typical errors which do\n   occur can be accommodated.  Usage of\
    \ the same wire, with the same\n   typical errors, for a computer-to- computer\
    \ connection is likely to\n   be a situation in which the errors are unacceptable.\
    \  The present\n   version of the Terminal IMP does not provide error control\
    \ either\n   within its hardware or within its software on any ports of the\n\
    \   Multi-Line Controller.  Further, we feel that computer-to-computer\n   connections\
    \ over common carrier circuits should employ strong error\n   control, such as\
    \ that\n   used on the IMP/IMP circuits, and that attempts to use minimal error\n\
    \   control (e.g., character parity) is an undesirable technical choice.\n   Strong\
    \ error control, with its retransmission scheme, not only would\n   imply significant\
    \ changes in the Terminal IMP, but a non-trivial\n   hardware/software implementation\
    \ at the remote computer end of the\n   circuit.\n        (2) Because the Terminal\
    \ IMP has many obligations, the share of\n   its bandwidth which can be given\
    \ to a Host coming in over the MLC\n   will be small.\n        (3) The command\
    \ language provided at a port of the Multi- Line\n   Controller was designed with\
    \ terminals and people in mind.  It\n   provides very few of the capabilities\
    \ which a computer requires in\n   order to effectively utilize the communication\
    \ network.  For example,\n   only a single pair of connections can be made from\
    \ a given Terminal\n   TMP port; Host computers generally desire a larger number\
    \ of\n   simultaneous connections to other Hosts on the network.  Assuming the\n\
    \   present Host/Host protocols, such a Host could not conveniently act\n   as\
    \ a server.\n        If, despite these potential difficulties, connection of a\n\
    \   computer to the network through an MLC port appears to be useful, BBN\n  \
    \ has no objection.  In fact, we would be extremely interested in\n   hearing\
    \ about actual experience with this type of network connection.\n   AMcK:jm\n\
