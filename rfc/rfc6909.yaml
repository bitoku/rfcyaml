  - "1.  Introduction\n   Mobile operators are expanding their network coverage by\
    \ integrating\n   various access technology domains (e.g., Wireless LAN, CDMA,\
    \ and\n   Long-Term Evolution (LTE)) into a common IP mobility core.  The Third\n\
    \   Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) S2a Proxy Mobile IPv6 [TS23402]\n  \
    \ reference point, specified by the 3GPP system architecture, defines\n   the\
    \ protocol interworking for building such integrated multi-access\n   networks.\
    \  In this scenario, the mobile node's IP traffic is always\n   tunneled back\
    \ from the mobile access gateway [RFC5213] in the access\n   network to the local\
    \ mobility anchor in the home network.  Currently,\n   there is no mechanism for\
    \ allowing some of the subscriber's IP flows\n   to be offloaded in the access\
    \ network.\n   With the exponential growth in mobile data traffic, mobile operators\n\
    \   are exploring new ways to offload some of the IP traffic flows at the\n  \
    \ nearest access edge.  The offload is intended either for local\n   service access\
    \ in the access network or for Internet offload through\n   the access network\
    \ when there is an Internet peering point.  Not all\n   IP traffic flows need\
    \ to be routed back to the home network; the\n   traffic that does not require\
    \ IP mobility support can be offloaded at\n   the mobile access gateway in the\
    \ access network.  This approach\n   allows efficient usage of the mobile packet\
    \ core, which helps in\n   lowering transport costs.  To identify the IP flows\
    \ that need to be\n   offloaded, the local mobility anchor in the home network\
    \ can deliver\n   the IP flow policy to the mobile access gateway in the access\n\
    \   network.  It is up to an operator's discretion to classify the\n   traffic\
    \ for offload.  One operator might choose to offload everything\n   except traffic\
    \ (such as Voice over IP) that requires QoS services.\n   Another might choose\
    \ to offload only HTTP traffic.  This\n   specification is only concerned with\
    \ matching IP traffic against a\n   given flow selector and classification of\
    \ IP traffic for offloading\n   purposes.  This approach has one limitation with\
    \ respect to\n   identifying encrypted traffic: IPsec-encrypted traffic with no\n\
    \   visibility into the application payload cannot be selected for\n   offload.\n\
    \   This document defines a new mobility option, the IPv4 Traffic Offload\n  \
    \ Selector option (see Section 3.1), for Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6).\n   This\
    \ option can be used by the local mobility anchor and the mobile\n   access gateway\
    \ for negotiating IPv4 traffic offload policy for a\n   mobility session.  This\
    \ IPv4 traffic offload policy identifies the\n   flow selectors that can be used\
    \ for selecting the flows that can be\n   offloaded at the access edge.  Since\
    \ the mobile node's IP address\n   topologically belongs to the home network,\
    \ the offloaded IPv4 traffic\n   flows may need to be NAT [RFC2663] translated.\
    \  These offloaded flows\n   will not have mobility support as the NAT becomes\
    \ the anchor point\n   for those flows.  However, when the traffic is offloaded\
    \ for local\n   service access as opposed to Internet offload, NAT translation\
    \ may\n   not be needed if the mobile access gateway is in the path for the\n\
    \   return traffic.  The decision on when to apply NAT translation can be\n  \
    \ based on local configuration on the mobile access gateway.  There are\n   better\
    \ ways to address the offload problem for IPv6, and with the\n   goal not to create\
    \ a NAT66 requirement, this specification therefore\n   does not address traffic\
    \ offload support for IPv6 flows.\n"

    \ port, and other fields in upper-layer headers.\n   IP Traffic Offload\n    \
    \  IP traffic offload is the approach of selecting specific IP flows\n      and\
    \ routing them through the access network instead of tunneling\n      them to\
    \ the home network.  Offload can also be between two access\n      networks (e.g.,\
    \ moving some of the traffic from LTE access to WLAN\n      access).\n"
- title: 3.  Solution Overview
  contents:
  - "3.  Solution Overview\n   Figure 1 illustrates the scenario where the mobile\
    \ access gateway in\n   an access network has enabled IPv4 traffic offload support\
    \ for a\n   mobility session.  The offload decision is based on the IPv4 traffic\n\
    \   offload policy that it negotiated with the local mobility anchor in\n   the\
    \ home network.  For example, all the HTTP flows may be offloaded\n   at the mobile\
    \ access gateway, and all the other flows for that\n   mobility session are tunneled\
    \ back to the local mobility anchor.  The\n   offloaded flows typically have to\
    \ be NAT translated, and this\n   specification does not impose any restrictions\
    \ on the location of the\n   NAT function.  It is possible for the NAT function\
    \ to be co-located\n   with the mobile access gateway or located somewhere at\
    \ the edge of\n   the access network.  When the NAT function is not co-located\
    \ with the\n   mobile access gateway, offloaded traffic flows must be delivered\n\
    \   through the local access network between the mobile access gateway\n   and\
    \ the NAT function, for example, through a VLAN or a point-to-point\n   link.\
    \  The exact means for this delivery are outside the scope of\n   this document.\
    \  If the offloaded IPv4 flows are for local service\n   access and reverse traffic\
    \ from the local service device can be\n   routed to the mobile node through the\
    \ mobile access gateway, the\n   offloaded flows may be delivered directly to\
    \ a local service device.\n   The traffic selectors in the IPv4 traffic offload\
    \ policy are used to\n   classify the traffic, so it can be offloaded at the access\
    \ network.\n   These parameters include source IP address, destination IP address,\n\
    \   TCP/UDP port numbers, and other fields.  The format of the IPv4\n   binary\
    \ traffic selector is specified in Section 3.1 of [RFC6088].\n               \

    \ the IPv4 Traffic\n      Offload Selector option, but the local mobility anchor\
    \ is not\n      configured to support IPv4 traffic offload support, then the local\n\
    \      mobility anchor will ignore the option and process the rest of the\n  \
    \    message as per [RFC5213].  This would have no effect on the\n      operation\
    \ of the rest of the protocol.\n   o  If the Proxy Binding Update message has\
    \ the IPv4 Traffic Offload\n      Selector option and if the local mobility anchor\
    \ is configured to\n      support IPv4 traffic offload support, then the local\
    \ mobility\n      anchor MUST enable IPv4 traffic offload support for that mobility\n\
    \      session.  The Proxy Binding Acknowledgement message that will be\n    \
    \  sent in response MUST include the IPv4 Traffic Offload Selector\n      option.\
    \  The following considerations apply with respect to\n      constructing the\
    \ IPv4 Traffic Offload Selector option.\n      *  The local mobility anchor can\
    \ obtain the offload policy from\n         the local configuration store or from\
    \ a network function such\n         as AAA (Authentication, Authorization, and\
    \ Accounting) or PCRF\n         (Policy and Charging Rule Function).  The offload\
    \ policy has to\n         be translated to a set of selectors that can be used\
    \ to match\n         the mobile node's IP flows, and these selectors have to be\n\
    \         carried in the Traffic Selector sub-option.  The Traffic\n         Selector\
    \ sub-option MUST be constructed as specified in Section\n         4.2.1.4 of\
    \ [RFC6089].  Considerations from Section 3.1 apply\n         with respect to\
    \ the Offload Mode (M) flag setting.\n      *  If the Proxy Binding Update message\
    \ includes a specific IPv4\n         traffic offload policy proposal in the form\
    \ of the Traffic\n         Selector sub-option [RFC6089], then the local mobility\
    \ anchor\n         MAY choose to agree to that request by including the same IPv4\n\
    \         traffic offload policy in the Proxy Binding Acknowledgement\n      \
    \   message.  This implies the local mobility anchor has agreed to\n         the\
    \ IPv4 traffic offload policy provided by the mobile access\n         gateway.\
    \  The local mobility anchor MAY also choose to override\n         the request\
    \ by including a different IPv4 traffic offload\n         policy that it wants\
    \ the mobile access gateway to enforce for\n         that mobility session.  This\
    \ is entirely based on the policy\n         configuration on the local mobility\
    \ anchor.\n      *  The IPv4 traffic offload policy that is sent to the mobile\n\
    \         access gateway has to be specific to the mobility session\n        \
    \ identified using the Mobile Node Identifier option [RFC5213].\n         The\
    \ offload policy MUST be specific to a mobile node's\n         application traffic.\
    \  The traffic selectors have to match only\n         the mobile node's application\
    \ traffic and MUST NOT match any\n         other mobile node's IP traffic.  Furthermore,\
    \ control-plane\n         traffic such as DHCP, Neighbor Discovery (ND), or any\
    \ other IP\n         traffic that is used for IP address configuration, mobility\n\
    \         management, or other control-plane functions MUST NOT be\n         subject\
    \ to offload.\n      *  The local mobility anchor MUST NOT make any changes to\
    \ the\n         mobile node's offload policy during the middle of a mobility\n\
    \         session, as long as the mobile node continues to attach to the\n   \
    \      mobile access gateway that negotiated the offload policy.\n         However,\
    \ when the mobile node performs an inter-MAG handover,\n         the new mobile\
    \ access gateway may not be capable of supporting\n         IP Traffic offload\
    \ and in this scenario, the offload policy may\n         change.  Therefore, the\
    \ IPv4 Traffic Selector option with the\n         Traffic Selector sub-option\
    \ that is delivered during the\n         initial mobility signaling MUST be the\
    \ same as the one that is\n         delivered as part of the mobility signaling\
    \ related to lifetime\n         extension from the same mobile access gateway.\n"
- title: 4.  Protocol Configuration Variables
  contents:
  - "4.  Protocol Configuration Variables\n   This specification defines the following\
    \ configuration variable that\n   controls the IPv4 traffic offload support feature.\
    \  This\n   configuration variable is internal to the system and has no bearing\n\
    \   on interoperability across different implementations.\n   The mobility entities,\
    \ local mobility anchor, and the mobile access\n   gateway have to allow these\
    \ variables to be configured by the system\n   management.  The configured values\
    \ for these protocol variables have\n   to survive server reboots and service\
    \ restarts.\n   EnableIPv4TrafficOffloadSupport\n         This flag indicates\
    \ whether or not IPv4 traffic offload support\n         needs to be enabled. \
    \ This configuration variable is available\n         at both the mobile access\
    \ gateway and the local mobility\n         anchor.  The default value for this\
    \ flag is set to (0),\n         indicating that IPv4 traffic offload support is\
    \ disabled.\n         When this flag on the mobile access gateway is set to a\
    \ value\n         of (1), the mobile access gateway has to enable IPv4 traffic\n\
    \         offload support for all mobility sessions, by specifically\n       \
    \  requesting the IPv4 traffic offload policy from the local\n         mobility\
    \ anchor by including the IPv4 Traffic Offload Selector\n         option in the\
    \ Proxy Binding Update message.  If the flag is set\n         to a value of (0),\
    \ the mobile access gateway has to disable\n         IPv4 traffic offload support\
    \ for all mobility sessions.\n         Similarly, when this flag on the local\
    \ mobility anchor is set\n         to a value of (1), the local mobility anchor\
    \ has to enable IPv4\n         traffic offload support.  If the local mobility\
    \ anchor chooses\n         to enable IPv4 traffic offload support when there is\
    \ an offload\n         policy specified for a mobile node, it has to deliver the\
    \ IPv4\n         traffic offload policy to the mobile access gateway by\n    \
    \     including the IPv4 Traffic Offload Selector option in the Proxy\n      \
    \   Binding Acknowledgement message.\n"
- title: 5.  IANA Considerations
  contents:
  - "5.  IANA Considerations\n   Per this specification, IANA has assigned a new mobility\
    \ option: the\n   IPv4 Traffic Offload Selector option (53).  This option is described\n\
    \   in Section 3.1.  The Type value for this option has been assigned\n   from\
    \ the same numbering space as allocated for the other mobility\n   options [RFC6275].\n"
- title: 6.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "6.  Security Considerations\n   The IPv4 Traffic Offload Selector option defined\
    \ in this\n   specification is for use in Proxy Binding Update and Proxy Binding\n\
    \   Acknowledgement messages.  This option is carried like any other\n   mobility\
    \ header option as specified in [RFC5213].  Therefore, it\n   inherits from [RFC5213]\
    \ its security guidelines and does not require\n   any additional security considerations.\
    \  Carrying IPv4 traffic\n   offload selectors does not introduce any new security\n\
    \   vulnerabilities.\n   When IPv4 traffic offload support is enabled for a mobile\
    \ node, the\n   mobile access gateway selectively offloads some of the mobile\
    \ node's\n   IPv4 traffic flows to the access network.  Typically, these offloaded\n\
    \   flows get NAT translated, which essentially introduces certain\n   vulnerabilities\
    \ that are common to any NAT deployment.  These\n   vulnerabilities and the related\
    \ considerations have been well\n   documented in the NAT specification [RFC2663].\
    \  There are no\n   additional considerations above and beyond what has already\
    \ been\n   documented by the NAT specifications and that are unique to the\n \
    \  approach specified in this document.\n   The mobile node's home network may\
    \ be equipped with firewall and\n   other security devices to guard against any\
    \ security threats.  When\n   IPv4 traffic offload support is enabled, it potentially\
    \ exposes the\n   mobile node to some security risks in the access network.  This\n\
    \   threat can be mitigated by deploying the security features both in\n   the\
    \ access network and in the home network.\n   When IPv4 traffic offload support\
    \ is enabled for a mobile node, some\n   of the IP flows are sent through the\
    \ home network, and some other IP\n   flows are routed through the access network.\
    \  This potentially\n   introduces some complexity with respect to enabling diagnostics\
    \ or\n   monitoring on the user traffic.  The tools that are used for such\n \
    \  diagnostics have to be aware of the offload policy that in enabled in\n   the\
    \ network.\n"
