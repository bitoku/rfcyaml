  - "1. Introduction\n   The MIME registration procedure described in RFC 2048 [1]\
    \ was\n   originally designed for transport of multimedia information via\n  \
    \ asynchronous Internet mail, but the MIME namespace now provides\n   identification\
    \ for other transport modes as well.  This document\n   defines the procedure\
    \ to register MIME subtype names for use with the\n   Real-time Transport Protocol\
    \ (RTP), RFC 3550 [2], to identify RTP\n   payload formats.\n   This document\
    \ also registers all the RTP payload formats defined in\n   the RTP Profile for\
    \ Audio and Video Conferences, RFC 3551 [3], as\n   MIME subtypes under the \"\
    audio\" and \"video\" MIME types.\n"

  contents:
  - "2. Procedure For Registering MIME Types for RTP Payload Types\n   Registering\
    \ an RTP payload type as a MIME type follows the same\n   procedures as described\
    \ in RFC 2048 and uses the registration\n   template shown in Section 2.8 of RFC\
    \ 2048.  Some additional\n   parameters are required to specify how a particular\
    \ payload format is\n   transported over RTP:\n      Published specification\n\
    \         A description of the encoding and a specification of the\n         payload\
    \ format must be provided, usually by reference to an RTP\n         payload format\
    \ specification RFC.  That RFC may be separate, or\n         the MIME subtype\
    \ registration may be incorporated into the\n         payload format specification\
    \ RFC.  The payload format\n         specification MUST include the RTP timestamp\
    \ clock rate (or\n         multiple rates for audio encodings with multiple sampling\n\
    \         rates).\n         A reference to a further description of the data compression\n\
    \         format itself should be provided, if available.\n      Required parameters\n\
    \         If the payload format does not have a fixed RTP timestamp clock\n  \
    \       rate, then a \"rate\" parameter is required to specify the RTP\n     \
    \    timestamp clock rate.  A particular payload format may have\n         additional\
    \ required parameters.\n      Optional parameters\n         Most audio payload\
    \ formats can have an optional \"channels\"\n         parameter to specify the\
    \ number of audio channels included in\n         the transmission.  Any payload\
    \ format, but most likely audio\n         formats, may also include the optional\
    \ parameters \"ptime\", to\n         specify the recommended length of time in\
    \ milliseconds\n         represented by the media in a packet, and/or \"maxptime\"\
    \ to\n         specify the maximum amount of media which can be encapsulated\n\
    \         in each packet, expressed as time in milliseconds.  The \"ptime\"\n\
    \         and \"maxptime\" parameters are defined in the Session\n         Description\
    \ Protocol (SDP) [5].\n         A particular payload format may have additional\
    \ optional\n         parameters.\n      Encoding considerations\n         The\
    \ fact that the type can be transferred via RTP MUST be\n         noted.\n   Depending\
    \ on whether the type has already been registered for\n   transfer with a non-RTP\
    \ protocol (e.g. MIME mail or http) or not,\n   several different cases can occur:\n\
    \      a) Not yet registered as a MIME type\n         A new registration should\
    \ be constructed using the MIME\n         registration template.  The registration\
    \ may specify transfer\n         via other means in addition to RTP if that is\
    \ feasible and\n         desired.  The encoding considerations must specify how\
    \ the type\n         is transferred via RTP.\n         Optional parameters may\
    \ be defined as needed, and it must be\n         clearly stated whether to which\
    \ mode(s) of transfer the\n         parameters apply.\n      b) MIME type exists\
    \ for a non-RTP protocol\n         The encoding considerations of the existing\
    \ type should be\n         changed to indicate that the type can also be transferred\
    \ via\n         RTP.\n         RTP-specific parameters may be added, and it must\
    \ be clearly\n         stated that these are only to be used when the media type\
    \ is\n         transmitted via RTP transport.\n      c) Update an existing MIME\
    \ type for RTP to be used for a non-RTP\n         protocol\n         The encoding\
    \ considerations of the existing type should be\n         changed to indicate\
    \ that the type can also be transferred via a\n         non-RTP protocol (e.g.\
    \ SMTP, HTTP).\n         Non-RTP-specific parameters can be added, and it must\
    \ be\n         clearly stated that these are only to be used when the media\n\
    \         type is transmitted via a non-RTP transport.\n"
- title: 3. Mapping to SDP Parameters
  contents:
  - "3. Mapping to SDP Parameters\n   The representation of a MIME media type is specified\
    \ in the syntax of\n   the Content-Type header field in RFC 2045 [6] as follows:\n\
    \      type \"/\" subtype  *(\";\" parameter)\n   Parameters may be required for\
    \ a particular type or subtype or they\n   may be optional.  For media types which\
    \ represent RTP payload\n   formats, the parameters \"rate\", \"channels\", \"\
    ptime\", and \"maxptime\"\n   have general definitions (given above) that may\
    \ apply across types\n   and subtypes.  The format for a parameter is specified\
    \ in RFC 2045 as\n      attribute \"=\" value\n   where attribute is the parameter\
    \ name and the permissible values are\n   specified for each parameter.  The value\
    \ may need to be a quoted\n   string if it contains any of the special characters\
    \ listed in RFC\n   2045.\n   The information carried in the media type string\
    \ has a specific\n   mapping to fields in the Session Description Protocol (SDP)\
    \ [5],\n   which is commonly used to describe RTP sessions.  The mapping is as\n\
    \   follows:\n      o  The MIME type (e.g., audio) goes in SDP \"m=\" as the media\
    \ name.\n      o  The MIME subtype (payload format) goes in SDP \"a=rtpmap\" as\
    \ the\n         encoding name.\n      o  The general (possibly optional) parameters\
    \ \"rate\" and\n         \"channels\" also go in \"a=rtpmap\" as clock rate and\
    \ encoding\n         parameters, respectively.\n      o  The general (and optional)\
    \ parameters \"ptime\" and \"maxptime\" go\n         in the SDP \"a=ptime\" and\
    \ \"a=maxptime\" attributes, respectively.\n      o  Any payload-format-specific\
    \ parameters go in the SDP \"a=fmtp\"\n         attribute.  The set of allowed\
    \ parameters is defined by the RFC\n         that specifies the payload format\
    \ and MUST NOT be extended by\n         the MIME subtype registration without\
    \ a corresponding revision\n         of the payload format specification.  The\
    \ format and syntax of\n         these parameters may also be defined by the payload\
    \ format\n         specification, but it is suggested that the parameters be\n\
    \         copied directly from the MIME media type string as a semicolon\n   \
    \      separated list of parameter=value pairs.  For payload formats\n       \
    \  that specify some other syntax for the fmtp parameters, the\n         registration\
    \ of that payload format as a MIME subtype must\n         specify what the parameters\
    \ are in MIME format and how to map\n         them to the SDP \"a=fmtp\" attribute.\
    \  See Section 4.1.21 for an\n         example.\n   An example mapping is as follows:\n\
    \      audio/L16; rate=48000; channels=2; ptime=5; emphasis=50-15\n      m=audio\
    \ 49170 RTP/AVP 97\n      a=rtpmap:97 L16/48000/2\n      a=fmtp:97 emphasis=50-15\n\
    \      a=ptime:5\n   Note that the payload format (encoding) names defined in\
    \ the RTP\n   Profile are commonly shown in upper case.  MIME subtypes are commonly\n\
    \   shown in lower case.  These names are case-insensitive in both\n   places.\
    \  Similarly, parameter names are case-insensitive both in MIME\n   types and\
    \ in the default mapping to the SDP a=fmtp attribute.\n"

    \ in this memo does\n   not impose any security considerations on its own.  This\
    \ memo also\n   contains several MIME type registrations.  The registrations\n\
    \   themselves do not impose security risks, but some may state security\n   considerations\
    \ specific to the particular registration.\n   Several audio and video encodings\
    \ are perfect for hiding data using\n   steganography.\n   The RTP specification,\
    \ RFC 3550, provides security considerations for\n   the transport of audio and\
    \ video data over RTP, including the use of\n   encryption where confidentiality\
    \ is required.\n"
