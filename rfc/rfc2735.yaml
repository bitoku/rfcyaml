  - "Abstract\n   The NBMA Next Hop Resolution Protocol (NHRP) is used to determine\
    \ the\n   NBMA subnetwork addresses of the \"NBMA next hop\" towards a public\n\
    \   internetworking layer address (see [1]).  This document describes the\n  \
    \ enhancements necessary to enable NHRP to perform the same function\n   for private\
    \ internetworking layer addresses available within the\n   framework of a Virtual\
    \ Private Network (VPN) service on a shared NBMA\n   network.\n"

  - "1. Introduction\n   NHRP is a public internetworking layer based resolution protocol.\n\
    \   There is an implicit understanding in [1] that a control message\n   applies\
    \ to the public address space.\n   Service Providers of Virtual Private Network\
    \ (VPN) services will\n   offer VPN participants specific service level agreements\
    \ (SLA) which\n   may include, for example, dedicated routing functions and/or\
    \ specific\n   QoS levels.  A particularly important feature of a VPN service\
    \ is the\n   ability to use a private address space which may overlap with the\n\
    \   address space of another VPN or the Public Internet.  Therefore, such\n  \
    \ an internetworking layer address only has meaning within the VPN in\n   which\
    \ it exists.  For this reason, it is necessary to identify the\n   VPN in which\
    \ a particular internetworking layer address has meaning,\n   the \"scope\" of\
    \ the internetworking layer address.\n   As VPNs are deployed on shared networks,\
    \ NHRP may be used to resolve\n   a private VPN address to a shared NBMA network\
    \ address.  In order to\n   properly resolve a private VPN address, it is necessary\
    \ for the NHRP\n   device to be able to identify the VPN in which the address\
    \ has\n   meaning and determine resolution information based on that \"scope\"\
    .\n   As VPN services are added to an NBMA network using NHRP devices, it\n  \
    \ may be necessary to support the service with legacy NHRP devices that\n   do\
    \ not have VPN knowledge and so do not explicitly support VPNs.\n   This document\
    \ describes requirements for \"VPN-aware\" NHRP entities to\n   support VPN services\
    \ while communicating with both \"VPN-aware\" and\n   \"non-VPN-aware\" NHRP entities.\n"

    , \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\",  \"MAY\", and\
    \ \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC\

    \ the\n   following definitions and acronyms are used:\n   Default Routing Instance\
    \ -- In the presence of VPNs, all packets are\n   processed (e.g., routed) within\
    \ the context of a specific VPN. In the\n   case where no VPN is indicated, a\
    \ packet is processed according to a\n   default VPN, i.e., a Default Routing\
    \ Instance.  This routing instance\n   may be the Public Internet, a particular\
    \ VPN, etc.  The term only has\n   meaning for \"VPN-aware\" NHRP entities.\n\

    \ as defined in this\n   document.\n   Non-VPN-aware -- a \"non-VPN-aware\" NHRP\
    \ entity is an NHRP entity\n   which is deployed as part of a single VPN, but\

    \   aware entities.\n   VPN encapsulation -- An LLC/SNAP encapsulation of a PDU\
    \ with an\n   indication of the VPN to which the PDU belongs. In the case that\
    \ the\n   underlying NBMA network is an ATM network, VPN encapsulation is\n  \
    \ specified in section 8 of [2].\n   VPN identifier (VPN-ID) -- in the context\
    \ of this specification, this\n   term is used as specified in [3].\n   VPN signalling\
    \ -- in the context of this specification, this term is\n   used to denote a method\
    \ to indicate the VPN-ID via control signalling\n   or similar ways in the control\
    \ path.\n"

  - "2.2  VPN Support Overview\n   When supporting NHRP for a VPN, it is necessary\
    \ to specify to which\n   VPN the NHRP message applies in order to comply with\
    \ the VPN service\n   level agreement applicable to that VPN.\n   On some NBMA\
    \ networks, it is possible to establish a VPN-specific\n   control path between\
    \ NHRP devices.  This is sufficient to identify\n   the NHRP control packets as\
    \ belonging to the \"inherited\" VPN.\n   However, when that alternative is not\
    \ used, the NHRP device must\n   specify the VPN to which an NHRP packet applies\
    \ in the PDU.\n   It is not useful to add a VPN extension to NHRP control messages\n\
    \   because transit NHRP Servers are not required to process the\n   extensions\
    \ to an NHRP control message (see 5.3 in [1]).  NHRP Servers\n   already deployed\
    \ might resolve the control packet within the scope of\n   the public internetworking\
    \ layer address space instead of the private\n   address space causing problems\
    \ in routing.\n   Instead, an LLC/SNAP header with a VPN indication (as specified\
    \ in\n   Section 4.1 below) will be prepended to the NHRP control message.\n \
    \  This solution allows the same VPN-specific LLC/SNAP header to be\n   prepended\
    \ to PDUs in both the control and data paths.\n"

  contents:
  - "3.1 VPN-Aware NHRP Operation\n   When a VPN-aware NHRP device forwards a packet\
    \ pertaining to a\n   particular VPN, that device MUST be able to indicate the\
    \ VPN either:\n      a) explicitly through use of the VPN-specific LLC/SNAP header\
    \ or\n      b) implictly through an indication via VPN signalling.\n   This applies\
    \ to NHC-NHS, NHS-NHS, and NHS-NHC control messages as\n   well as NHC-NHC shortcut\
    \ traffic.\n   For case a), the indication of the VPN-ID is via a VPN-specific\n\
    \   LLC/SNAP header specified in section 4.2 below.  In the case of an\n   underlying\
    \ ATM network, see also section 8 of [2].\n   For case b), the method used to\
    \ indicate the VPN-ID via VPN\n   signalling depends on the mechanisms available\
    \ in the underlying\n   network and is outside the scope of this memo.  A VPN-aware\
    \ NHRP\n   entity using VPN signalling SHOULD NOT also indicate the VPN-ID\n \
    \  explicity for any PDU on the related path.\n   In transiting an NHRP Server,\
    \ the VPN identification MAY be forwarded\n   in a different format than was received,\
    \ however, the same VPN-ID\n   MUST be indicated for the message.  For example,\
    \ a PDU received with\n   an LLC/SNAP header containing a VPN identifier may be\
    \ forwarded on a\n   control path which was established with an indication of\
    \ the same VPN\n   without the VPN-specific LLC/SNAP header.\n   When a VPN capable\
    \ NHRP entity receives an NHRP message from a VPN-\n   aware NHRP device without\
    \ a VPN indication via VPN encapsulation or\n   VPN signalling, the message applies\
    \ to the default routing instance\n   supported by the shared infrastructure.\
    \ The public Internet or a\n   particular VPN routing realm may be configured\
    \ as the default routing\n   instance.\n"

  contents:
  - "3.2 Interactions of VPN-aware and non-VPN-aware NHRP entities\n   A VPN-aware\
    \ NHRP entity MUST be able to indicate the VPN-ID in one of\n   the ways specified\
    \ in section 3.1 above. It MAY participate in more\n   than one VPN.\n   Because\
    \ a non-VPN-aware NHRP device does not understand the concept\n   of VPNs, it\
    \ only supports a single routing instance.  Therefore, a\n   non-VPN-aware NHRP\
    \ entity belongs to exactly one VPN without being\n   aware of it. All internetworking\
    \ packets sent by that entity are\n   assumed to belong to that VPN (Note that\
    \ if the current IPv4-based\n   Internet is regarded as just one big VPN, attached\
    \ IPv4 hosts may\n   e.g. be regarded as being \"contained\" in that VPN).\n \
    \  In order for a non-VPN-aware NHRP entity to interact with a VPN-aware\n   NHRP\
    \ entity, the VPN-aware NHRP entity MUST be configured to\n   associate the correct\
    \ VPN-ID with information received from the non-\n   VPN-aware entity. In other\
    \ words, the VPN-aware NHRP entity acts as\n   in the case of option b) from section\
    \ 3.1 where the VPN-ID was\n   indicated via VPN signalling.  However, this association\
    \ is\n   provisioned using administrative means that are beyond the scope of\n\
    \   this document instead of via VPN signalling.  Further, it MUST be\n   ensured\
    \ by administrative means that non-VPN-aware NHRP entities only\n   communicate\
    \ either with other NHRP entities contained in the same\n   VPN, or with VPN-aware\
    \ NHRP entities with pre- configured information\n   about the related VPN-ID\
    \ of those non-VPN-aware entities.\n   VPN-aware NHRP entities SHALL only send\
    \ information to non-VPN-aware\n   NHRP entities if that information belongs to\
    \ the VPN in which the\n   non-VPN-aware entity is contained. Information sent\
    \ to a non-VPN-\n   aware NHRP entity MUST not include any indication of the VPN-ID.\n\
    \   In order to correctly transfer data packets, it is necessary for\n   VPN-aware\
    \ ingress NHRP clients to know whether their partner is also\n   VPN-aware.  If\
    \ the egress is VPN-aware, the ingress NHC will also use\n   the means described\
    \ in section 3.1 on an NBMA shortcut to that egress\n   NHC to specify the VPN\
    \ to which the data packet belongs.\n   For this purpose, a further NHRP extension\
    \ (in addition to those\n   specified in section 5.3 of [1]) is specified which\
    \ is called NHRP\n   Device Capabilities extension (see section 4.2 below). This\
    \ extension\n   currently indicates the VPN capabilities of NHRP source and\n\
    \   destination entities, but may also be used in the future for further\n   additions\
    \ to NHRP to indicate other capabilities as well.\n"

  contents:
  - "3.3 Handling of the NHRP Device Capabilities extension\n   The NHRP Device Capabilities\
    \ extension MUST be attached to all NHRP\n   Resolution Requests generated by\
    \ a VPN-aware source NHRP entity.  The\n   device SHOULD set the Source Capabilities\
    \ field to indicate that it\n   supports VPNs.  The compulsory bit MUST be set\
    \ to zero, so that a\n   non-VPN-aware NHS may safely ignore the extension when\
    \ forwarding the\n   request.  In addition, the A-bit (see section 5.2.1 of [1])\
    \ SHOULD be\n   set to indicate that only authoritative next hop information is\n\
    \   desired to avoid non-authoritative replies from non-VPN-aware NHRP\n   servers.\n\
    \   Since a non-VPN-aware NHS is not able to process the NHRP Device\n   Capability\
    \ extension, Network Admistrators MUST avoid configurations\n   in which a VPN-aware\
    \ NHRP Client is authoritatively served by a non-\n   VPN-aware NHRP Server.\n\
    \   If an egress NHS receives an NHRP Resolution Request with an NHRP\n   Device\
    \ Capability Extension included, it returns an NHRP Resolution\n   Reply with\
    \ an indication of whether the destination is VPN-aware by\n   correctly setting\
    \ the target capabilities flag [see Section 4.2].\n   If an egress NHS receives\
    \ an NHRP Resolution Request without an NHRP\n   Device Capability Extension included\
    \ or with the source capabilities\n   flag indicating that the source NHRP device\
    \ is non-VPN-aware, it MAY\n   act in one of the following ways:\n      -  It\
    \ MAY reject the NHRP Resolution Request; this is because the\n         VPN-aware\
    \ destination will be unable to determine the context\n         of information\
    \ received on an NBMA shortcut from a non-VPN-\n         aware NHRP source.  This\
    \ is the default case.\n      -  If the destination is also non-VPN-aware, it\
    \ MAY accept the\n         request and return an NHRP Resolution Reply.  By default,\
    \ the\n         two non-VPN-aware NHRP clients will interact correctly.\n    \
    \  -  It MAY offer itself as a destination and resolve the request\n         using\
    \ its own NBMA address, if it has the related capabilities.\n      -  If the indicated\
    \ VPN-ID identifies the default routing instance\n         of the destination,\
    \ the NHS MAY accept the request and send a\n         corresponding NHRP Resolution\
    \ Reply.\n   The NHRP Device Capabilities extension SHOULD NOT be included in\
    \ the\n   NHRP Register Request and Reply messages.\n"

    \ indicated via VPN\n   encapsulation which is in conflict to a VPN-ID earlier\
    \ allocated to\n   that communication (e.g. via VPN signalling or administratively\
    \ via\n   configuration), it SHOULD send back an NHRP error indication (see\n\
    \   5.2.7 of [1]) to the sender indicating error code 16 (VPN mismatch).\n   However,\
    \ in order to avoid certain security issues, an NHRP entity\n   MAY instead silently\
    \ drop the packet.\n   If a VPN-aware NHRP entity receives a packet for a VPN\

- title: 4.3 Error Codes
  contents:
  - "4.3 Error Codes\n   The following further Error Codes are defined in addition\
    \ to those\n   specified in section 5.2.7 of [1]):\n      16 - VPN mismatch\n\
    \         This error code is returned by a VPN-capable NHRP device, if it\n  \
    \       receives a PDU with a VPN-ID in the LLC/SNAP header different\n      \
    \   from the VPN-ID which had been specified earlier via VPN\n         signalling.\n\
    \      17 - VPN not supported\n         This error code is returned by a VPN-capable\
    \ NHRP device, if it\n         receives an NHRP message for a VPN that it does\
    \ not support.\n"
- title: 5. Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "5. Security Considerations\n   For any VPN application, it is important that\
    \ VPN-related information\n   is not misdirected to other VPNs and is not accessible\
    \ when being\n   transferred across a public or shared infrastructure. It is therefore\n\
    \   RECOMMENDED to use the VPN support functions specified in this\n   document\
    \ in combination with NHRP authentication as specified in\n   section 5.3.4 of\
    \ [1]. Section 5.3.4.4 of [1] also provides further\n   information on general\
    \ security considerations related to NHRP.\n   In cases where the NHRP entity\
    \ does not trust all of the NHRP\n   entities, or is uncertain about the availability\
    \ of the end-to-end\n   NHRP authentication chain, it may use IPsec for confidentiality,\n\
    \   integrity, etc.\n"
- title: 6. IANA Considerations
  contents:
  - "6. IANA Considerations\n   The LLC/SNAP protocol ID 0x00-08 for VPN encapsulation\
    \ had already\n   been allocated by IANA in conjunction with [2].  This specification\n\
    \   does not require the allocation of any additional LLC/SNAP protocol\n   IDs\
    \ beyond that.\n   It should be noted that IANA - as the owner of the VPN-related\
    \ OUI:\n   0x00-00-5E - is itself also a VPN authority which may allocate VPN\n\
    \   indices to identify VPNs.  The use of these particular VPN indices\n   within\
    \ the context of this specification is reserved, and requires\n   allocation and\
    \ approval by the IESG in accordance with RFC 2434.\n"
