- title: Abstract
  contents:
  - "Abstract\n   In 2005-2006, the IPv6 MIB update group published updated versions\
    \ of\n   the IP-MIB, UDP-MIB, TCP-MIB, and IP-FORWARD-MIB modules, which use\n\
    \   the InetAddressType/InetAddress construct to handle IPv4 and IPv6 in\n   the\
    \ same table.  This document contains versions of the obsoleted\n   IPV6-MIB,\
    \ IPV6-TC, IPV6-ICMP-MIB, IPV6-TCP-MIB, and IPV6-UDP-MIB\n   modules for the purpose\
    \ of updating MIB module repositories.  This\n   document obsoletes RFCs 2452,\
    \ 2454, 2465, and 2466 (i.e., the RFCs\n   containing these MIBs) and reclassifies\
    \ them as Historic.\n"

- title: 1.  Motivation
  contents:
  - "1.  Motivation\n   In 2005-2006, the IPv6 MIB update group published updated\
    \ versions of\n   the IP-MIB [RFC4293], UDP-MIB [RFC4113], TCP-MIB [RFC4022],\
    \ and IP-\n   FORWARD-MIB [RFC4292] modules, which use the InetAddressType/\n\
    \   InetAddress construct to handle IPv4 and IPv6 in the same table.  The\n  \
    \ RFC Editor marked these documents as obsoleting the corresponding\n   IPV6-MIBs,\
    \ but the extracted content of these MIBs never changed in\n   MIB repositories,\
    \ and the original RFCs (as is normal IETF policy)\n   never changed from being\
    \ Proposed Standard.\n   Note that the timeline of these MIB modules is as shown\
    \ below (and it\n   is the added support for IPv6 in the later revision of the\
    \ original\n   modules that people often overlook).\n                        \
    \  IPv6-MIB--------X\n                                           \\\n        \
    \         IP-MIB-------------------IP-MIB--->\n   This causes an unclear situation\
    \ when simply looking at MIB\n   repositories, so we are simply republishing these\
    \ MIB modules with\n   the Structure of Management Information (SMI) status changed\
    \ to\n   obsolete.  This is an unusual step, and it is not the intended path\n\
    \   with every obsolete MIB module; the special history of these modules\n   led\
    \ to this special step.\n"
