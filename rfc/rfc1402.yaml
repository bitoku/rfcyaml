  contents:
  - "1.0  Introduction\n   This paper is a list of the essential things, in my view,\
    \ that a\n   people who are responsible for providing network information should\n\
    \   have in their hands as reference material.  One of the basic problems\n  \
    \ with information is making it easily available to those who need the\n   data.\
    \  Libraries have been performing a cataloging function for many\n   centuries.\
    \  Information flow is now being provided so fast that it is\n   difficult to\
    \ keep up with it, even partially. Computer networks have\n   only added to the\
    \ problem by opening up access to even more\n   information.\n   Attempting to\
    \ make this wealth of information available to those who\n   would find it useful\
    \ poses some problems.\n   First, we need to know of its existence.  To that end,\
    \ this paper\n   provides an index to the vast realm of network information. Most\
    \ of\n   the documents listed here are POINTERS to the final information.\n  \
    \ Second, even if you know of a document's existence, you may not know\n   if\
    \ it is important or relevant.  Few of us are knowledgeable in more\n   than a\
    \ limited area.  We need to rely on others to make us aware of\n   the importance\
    \ of databases in a specific discipline. Librarians can\n   be of great assistance\
    \ here.  They are familiar with the research\n   databases that individuals search\
    \ in law, mathematics, and many other\n   fields.\n   Finally, once existence\
    \ and importance are known, the information\n   needs to be indexed so that researchers\
    \ can find it.  This is the\n   most difficult task to accomplish.  Information\
    \ available on the\n   network is rarely static.  It is always moving, growing,\
    \ changing,\n   and dying.  Computers should be able to assist us in managing\
    \ this\n   ever-changing environment.  Right now, we have to catalog the\n   information\
    \ as it passes through the network.  In my  case, I\n   generally save it in a\
    \ file somewhere and spend far too much time\n   trying to retrieve it again when\
    \ I need it.\n"
- title: 1.5  Access to the Internet
  contents:
  - "1.5  Access to the Internet\n   A frequently asked question concerns how the\
    \ average mortal gets\n   access to the Internet.  The most common way is via\
    \ electronic mail.\n   Using e-mail, it is possible to communicate with anyone\
    \ on the\n   Internet and on any other networks as well, and there are many\n\
    \   \"gateways\" to the Internet from other networks and systems.  For\n   instance\
    \ using CompuServe, a large commercial electronic information\n   and communication\
    \ service, you can send e-mail to and from\n   individuals on the Internet.\n\
    \   A direct connection to the Internet provides some additional\n   capabilities\
    \ that e-mail cannot.  One of these is the ability to\n   establish a connection\
    \ to a remote computer connected to the Internet\n   from your own personal computer\
    \ or from one connected to the\n   Internet. The program that establishes this\
    \ connection is called\n   Telnet.  Many universities and large research companies\
    \ have Internet\n   connections.  They pay rather large fees to have these high\
    \ speed\n   (more than one million bits per second) connections.  If you are\n\
    \   associated with a large university or company you already may have\n   access\
    \ or can gain access to the Internet using one of their\n   computers.\n   A direct\
    \ connection to the Internet also allows you to transfer a\n   file from a remote\
    \ computer.  This program is referred to as FTP\n   (file transfer protocol).\
    \  Section 4.0 covers the many places that\n   have files and programs available\
    \ using FTP.\n   The following information was taken from a Frequently Asked Question\n\
    \   posting by Aydin Edguer to the alt.bbs newsgroup.\n   If you do not have access\
    \ to a service connected to Internet, you can\n   get access for a fee.  The following\
    \ companies provide Internet\n   access to individuals or companies at various\
    \ rates depending on the\n   time of access, speed of access desired, and several\
    \ other factors.\n   The first method to gain access to the Internet is by getting\
    \ an\n   account on a public access bulletin board system that is connected to\n\
    \   the Internet.  There are a growing number of such systems available.\n   For\
    \ information on some of these systems, send electronic mail to:\n        info@world.std.com\n\
    \        info@netcom.com\n        info@concert.net\n        info@panix.com\n \
    \       info@holonet.net\n        info@msen.com\n        info@csn.org\n      \
    \  sysadmin@ids.com\n   Any of these systems is open to the public for a monthly\
    \ access fee.\n   A second method to gain access to the Internet is by getting\
    \ an\n   account with a network service provider who offers a dial-in service.\n\
    \   See the \"How do I get connected to the Internet?\" section for more\n   information.\n\
    \   How do I get connected to the Internet?\n   Traditionally, connections to\
    \ the Internet were dedicated\n   connections.  This is still the most common\
    \ type of connection.\n   Monthly costs for the connection range anywhere from\
    \ $250 per month\n   [plus line charges] for a dialup 9600-bps connection to $4,000\
    \ [plus\n   line charges] for a T1 [1.44-Mbps] connection.  There is also an\n\
    \   initial one-time startup fee of anywhere from $100 to $8,000 [plus\n   equipment\
    \ charges].\n   Some service providers also are offering part-time dialup\n  \
    \ connections.  Customers share a set of phone lines and dialup when\n   needed.\
    \  This is usually less expensive than dedicated dialup\n   connections for customers\
    \ who need a connection less than 80 hours\n   per month.  Monthly costs range\
    \ from $40-100 per month [plus line\n   charges] plus an hourly charge of $2-4.\n\
    \   Some service providers have begun to offer a new dial-in service.\n   The\
    \ name for dial-in service varies from vendor to vendor.  The\n   dial-in service\
    \ is usually provided as a way for Internet-connected\n   users to connect back\
    \ to their home sites from remote locations.  But\n   most service providers do\
    \ not limit their service to this audience,\n   it is open to people not already\
    \ on the Internet.  The dial-in\n   service provides either a terminal server\
    \ connection [with password]\n   or an account on the service provider's equipment\
    \ [with password]\n   which permits you to use Telnet to connect to other sites\
    \ on the\n   Internet.  This service differs from the normal dialup IP services\n\
    \   because it does not require the user to run any IP software like PPP\n   (Point-to-Point\
    \ protocol) or SLIP (serial line IP).  The cost for\n   this service usually range\
    \ from $35 to $250 per month [plus line\n   charges].  There is also an initial\
    \ $35 to $500 connection fee [plus\n   equipment charges].\n   The following is\
    \ a list of known Internet service providers, along\n   with the services they\
    \ offer, an e-mail address to contact for more\n   information, a phone number\
    \ to contact for more information, or an\n   FTP archive for more information.\n\

    \ (614)292-0700\n   Please note, although this is a Frequently asked Question,\
    \ this\n   newsgroup, alt.bbs.internet, is NOT for the discussion of how to get\n\

    \ bulletin board system and what it offers once you are connected\n   to the Internet.\n\
    \   The above excerpt is from a frequently asked questions Usenet posting\n  \

    \ a great deal of\n   information about techniques and rates to access the Internet.\
    \  Of\n   course one common question is about getting free access.  As\n   mentioned\
    \ before if you are associated with a university, a large\n   company, or research\
    \ group you may very well have access via one of\n   their computers.  If you\
    \ are a student or faculty member and are away\n   from your local campus, you\
    \ may be able to get a guest account from\n   the local university.\n   Some campuswide\
    \ information systems may give limited access to the\n   network in a read-only\
    \ mode.  Also some communities (such as\n   Cleveland) operate a FREENET which\
    \ enables you to read newsgroups and\n   if you register send mail at no charge.\
    \  See section 8.0 for more\n   information.\n   For example, you can Telnet to\
    \ Holonet below to get an idea of how it\n   works.  This is not an endorsement\

    \   2.16 World Wide Webb\n      The WWW project merges the techniques of information\
    \ retrieval and\n      hypertext to make an easy but powerful global information\
    \ system.\n      The project is based on the philosophy that academic information\n\
    \      should be freely available to anyone. Its aim is to permit\n      information\
    \ sharing within internationally dispersed teams and\n      dissemination of information\
    \ by support groups.  Originally aimed\n      at the High Energy Physics community,\
    \ it has spread to other areas\n      and attracted much interest in user support,\
    \ resource discovery,\n      and collaborative work areas.\n      Reader View\n\
    \      The WWW world consists of documents and links.  Indexes are\n      special\
    \ documents which, rather than being read, can be searched.\n      The result\
    \ of such a search is another (\"virtual\") document\n      containing links to\
    \ the documents found.  A simple protocol\n      (\"HTTP\") is used to allow a\
    \ browser program to request a keyword\n      search by a remote information server.\n\
    \      The web contains documents in many formats. Those hypertext\n      documents\
    \ (real or virtual) contain links to other documents or\n      places within documents.\
    \  All documents, whether real, virtual or\n      indexes, look similar to the\
    \ reader and are contained within the\n      same addressing scheme.\n      To\
    \ follow a link, you either click with a mouse or type in a\n      number. To\
    \ search an index, give keywords or other search\n      criteria. These are the\
    \ only operations necessary to access the\n      entire world of data.\n     \
    \ You can try the simple line mode browser by Telnetting to\n      info.cern.ch\
    \ (no user or password) From UK JANET, use the gateway.\n      You also can find\
    \ out more about WWW in this way.  This is the\n      least sophisticated browser;\
    \ remember that the window-oriented\n      ones are much smarter.\n      It is\
    \ much more efficient to install a browser on your own\n      machine. The line\
    \ mode browser is currently available in source\n      form by anonymous FTP from\

  - "4.0  The Mother Lode of Anonymous FTP Sites\n   Throughout this document, sites\
    \ are listed for specific documents.\n   Most are only indexes to more information.\
    \  A big problem is\n   searching through all this information to find what you\
    \ want.  One of\n   the best search methods is Archie, described below.\n   Several\
    \ sites contain large repositories of files and other sites\n   that are the source\
    \ for specific programs such as Kermit, the public\n   domain file transfer program.\n\
    \   4.05 archie\n      One of the best ways of searching for a program available\
    \ via\n      anonymous FTP is with archie (Archive Server Listing Service),\n\
    \      several of these servers scattered throughout the world.  The\n      fastest\
    \ one I have found is the Advanced Network & Services, Inc.\n      located in\
    \ the United States.\n      Archie goes to every site that offers anonymous FTP\
    \ files,\n      collects the file structure from that site, and places it in a\n\
    \      database it can search.\n      A real-life example.  I was reading an article\
    \ about Windows in\n      the July 1992 issue of PC World, and it mentioned a\
    \ shareware\n      program called ZiPaper on page 212.  The name of the program\

- title: 12.0  Glossary
  contents:
  - "12.0  Glossary\n      I use some terms here that may not be familiar to all.\
    \  The\n      following is a brief explanation.\n   12.1  BITNET:\n      A network\
    \ of mainframes or minicomputers.  BITNET\n      connects many universities and\
    \ colleges.  It provides\n      e-mail and file transfer capabilities, but does\
    \ not have the\n      ability to do remote login (Telnet session capability).\n\
    \   12.2  Internet:\n      A very large network that connects just about any types\
    \ of\n      computers.  It supports e-mail, file transfer (FTP), and\n      remote\
    \ login (Telnet).\n   12.3  Anonymous FTP:\n      The ability to transfer a file\
    \ from a remote computer connected\n      to the Internet without having an account\
    \ on the remote computer.\n      The program that performs the file transfer is\
    \ normal FTP.  To\n      connect to a remote computer offering anonymous FTP,\
    \ you can use\n      the following commands from a computer connected to the Internet.\n\
    \      FTP Internet computer name\n      When prompted for a userid, type anonymous\n\
    \      When prompted for a password, type your e-mail address\n      To get a\
    \ listing of files type dir\n      To change directory, type cd directory name\n\
    \      To get a file, type get filename\n      To get a binary file, type binary\
    \ then get filename\n      To end session, type quit\n      Example:\n      FTP\
    \ pilot.njin.net\n      Username:  anonymous\n      Password:  yourname@computer.edu\n\
    \      cd pub/ftp-list\n      get ftp.list\n      quit\n   12.4  Telnet:\n   \
    \   The ability to establish a connection to a remote computer\n      connected\
    \ to the Internet network.  Two types of programs are used\n      to do this.\
    \  One, usually called Telnet, establishes a VT100-type\n      terminal emulation\
    \ to the remote computer.  The second, TN3270,\n      establishes a full-screen\
    \ IBM 3270-type terminal connection.\n   12.5  Listserv:\n      A program available\
    \ on many BITNET connected computers that can\n      act as a mail forwarding\
    \ system and as a file repository.  BITNET\n      is another network that links\
    \ many colleges and universities It\n      does not normally link to military\
    \ or government institutions as\n      does the Internet.  To subscribe to a listserv,\
    \ you usually send\n      mail to the machine that has the mailing list with the\
    \ command to\n      subscribe.  As an example, to subscribe to a list for discussion\n\
    \      of topics pertinent to mechanical engineering, send e-mail to\n      listserv@utarlvml\
    \ with a message containing the one-line command\n      to subscribe:\n      SUB\
    \ MECH-1 John Doe  (Where John Doe would be your full name)\n   12.6 Usenet/Read\
    \ News\n      Newsgroups are like public bulletin boards that you can post and\n\
    \      read messages from other individuals world wide.  More than 1500\n    \
    \  groups cover topics ranging from arts and recreation to more\n      research\
    \ oriented topics such as physics, philosohy, microbiology\n      and many many\
    \ others.  Normally you gain access through a computer\n      that has lots of\
    \ disk space and is connected directly to the\n      Internet.  You can read many\
    \ of the newgroups from the Cleveland\n      Freenet (section 8.1) or from commercial\
    \ providors of Intenet\n      access; for example, Holonet (section 1.7).\n"
- title: Disclaimer
  contents:
  - "Disclaimer\n   The information provided in the previous sections has been put\n\
    \   together from multiple sources acquired from the network.  Much of it\n  \
    \ came from reading newsgroups and trying things out to see how they\n   worked.\
    \  The information is as accurate as I have been able to\n   determine, as of\
    \ July 17, 1992.\n   I used a DEC5500 system running Ultrix to check most of these\n\
    \   sources.  Most of the information is oriented toward Internet, since\n   it\
    \ has remote login (Telnet) and file transfer (FTP).\n"
