  - "1.  Introduction\n   The Real-time Transport Protocol, the associated RTP Control\
    \ Protocol\n   (RTP/RTCP, RFC 3550) [1], and the profile for audiovisual\n   communications\
    \ with minimal control (RFC 3551) [2] define mechanisms\n   for transmitting time-based\
    \ media across an IP network.  RTP provides\n   means to preserve timing and detect\
    \ packet losses, among other\n   things, and RTP payload formats provide for proper\
    \ framing of\n   (continuous) media in a packet-based environment.  RTCP enables\n\
    \   receivers to provide feedback on reception quality and allows all\n   members\
    \ of an RTP session to learn about each other.\n   The RTP specification provides\
    \ only rudimentary support for\n   encrypting RTP and RTCP packets.  Secure RTP\
    \ (RFC 3711) [4] defines\n   an RTP profile (\"SAVP\") for secure RTP media sessions,\
    \ defining\n   methods for proper RTP and RTCP packet encryption, integrity, and\n\
    \   replay protection.  The initial negotiation of SRTP and its security\n   parameters\
    \ needs to be done out-of-band, e.g., using the Session\n   Description Protocol\
    \ (SDP, RFC 4566) [6] together with extensions for\n   conveying keying material\
    \ (RFC 4567 [7], RFC 4568 [8]).\n   The RTP specification also provides limited\
    \ support for timely\n   feedback from receivers to senders, typically by means\
    \ of reception\n   statistics reporting in somewhat regular intervals depending\
    \ on the\n   group size, the average RTCP packet size, and the available RTCP\n\
    \   bandwidth.  The extended RTP profile for RTCP-based feedback (\"AVPF\")\n\
    \   (RFC 4585, [3]) allows session participants statistically to provide\n   immediate\
    \ feedback while maintaining the average RTCP data rate for\n   all senders. \
    \ As for SAVP, the use of AVPF and its parameters needs\n   to be negotiated out-of-band\
    \ by means of SDP (RFC 4566, [6]) and the\n   extensions defined in RFC 4585 [3].\n\
    \   Both SRTP and AVPF are RTP profiles and need to be negotiated.  This\n   implies\
    \ that either one or the other may be used, but both profiles\n   cannot be negotiated\
    \ for the same RTP session (using one SDP session\n   level description).  However,\
    \ using secure communications and timely\n   feedback together is desirable. \
    \ Therefore, this document specifies a\n   new RTP profile (\"SAVPF\") that combines\
    \ the features of SAVP and\n   AVPF.\n   As SAVP and AVPF are largely orthogonal,\
    \ the combination of both is\n   mostly straightforward.  No sophisticated algorithms\
    \ need to be\n   specified in this document.  Instead, reference is made to both\n\
    \   existing profiles and only the implications of their combination and\n   possible\
    \ deviations from rules of the existing profiles are described\n   as is the negotiation\
    \ process.\n"

    \ used in this document:\n   RTP session:\n        An association among a set\
    \ of participants communicating with\n        RTP as defined in RFC 3550 [1].\n\
    \   (SDP) media description:\n        This term refers to the specification given\
    \ in a single m= line\n        in an SDP message.  An SDP media description may\
    \ define only one\n        RTP session.\n   Media session:\n        A media session\
    \ refers to a collection of SDP media descriptions\n        that are semantically\
    \ grouped to represent alternatives of the\n        same communications means.\
    \  Out of such a group, one will be\n        negotiated or chosen for a communication\
    \ relationship and the\n        corresponding RTP session will be instantiated.\
    \  If no common\n        session parameters suitable for the involved endpoints\
    \ can be\n        found, the media session will be rejected.  In the simplest\n\
    \        case, a media session is equivalent to an SDP media description\n   \
    \     and equivalent to an RTP session.\n"

- title: 2.  SAVPF Rules
  contents:
  - "2.  SAVPF Rules\n   SAVP is defined as an intermediate layer between RTP (following\
    \ the\n   regular RTP profile AVP) and the transport layer (usually UDP).  This\n\
    \   yields a two-layer hierarchy within the Real-time Transport Protocol.\n  \
    \ In SAVPF, the upper (AVP) layer is replaced by the extended RTP\n   profile\
    \ for feedback (AVPF).\n   AVPF modifies timing rules for transmitting RTCP packets\
    \ and adds\n   extra RTCP packet formats specific to feedback.  These functions\
    \ are\n   independent of whether or not RTCP packets are subsequently encrypted\n\
    \   and/or integrity protected.  The functioning of the AVPF layer\n   remains\
    \ unchanged in SAVPF.\n   The AVPF profile derives from RFC 3550 [1] the (optional)\
    \ use of the\n   encryption prefix for RTCP.  The encryption prefix MUST NOT be\
    \ used\n   within the SAVPF profile (it is not used in SAVP, as it is only\n \
    \  applicable to the encryption method specified in [1]).\n   The SAVP part uses\
    \ extra fields added to the end of RTP and RTCP\n   packets and executes cryptographic\
    \ transforms on (some of) the\n   RTP/RTCP packet contents.  This behavior remains\
    \ unchanged in SAVPF.\n   The average RTCP packet size calculation done by the\
    \ AVPF layer for\n   timing purposes MUST take into account the fields added by\
    \ the SAVP\n   layer.\n   The SRTP part becomes active only when the RTP or RTCP\
    \ was scheduled\n   by the \"higher\" AVPF layer or received from the transport\
    \ protocol,\n   irrespective of its timing and contents.\n"
- title: 2.1.  Packet Formats
  contents:
  - "2.1.  Packet Formats\n   AVPF defines extra packet formats to provide feedback\
    \ information.\n   Those extra packet formats defined in RFC 4585 [3] (and further\
    \ ones\n   defined elsewhere for use with AVPF) MAY be used with SAVPF.\n   SAVP\
    \ defines a modified packet format for SRTP and SRTCP packets that\n   essentially\
    \ consists of the RTP/RTCP packet formats plus some\n   trailing protocol fields\
    \ for security purposes.  For SAVPF, all RTCP\n   packets MUST be encapsulated\
    \ as defined in Section 3.4 of RFC 3711\n   [4].\n"
- title: 2.2.  Extensions
  contents:
  - "2.2.  Extensions\n   Extensions to AVPF RTCP feedback packets defined elsewhere\
    \ MAY be\n   used with the SAVPF profile provided that those extensions are in\n\
    \   conformance with the extension rules of RFC 4585 [3].\n   Additional extensions\
    \ (e.g., transforms) defined for SAVP following\n   the rules of Section 6 of\
    \ RFC 3711 [4] MAY also be used with the\n   SAVPF profile.  The overhead per\
    \ RTCP packet depends on the\n   extensions and transforms chosen.  New extensions\
    \ and transforms\n   added in the future MAY introduce yet unknown further per-packet\n\
    \   overhead.\n   Finally, further extensions specifically to SAVPF MAY be defined\n\
    \   elsewhere.\n"
- title: 2.3.  Implications from Combining AVPF and SAVP
  contents:
  - "2.3.  Implications from Combining AVPF and SAVP\n   The AVPF profile aims at\
    \ -- statistically -- allowing receivers to\n   provide timely feedback to senders.\
    \  The frequency at which receivers\n   are, on average, allowed to send feedback\
    \ information depends on the\n   RTCP bandwidth, the group size, and the average\
    \ size of an RTCP\n   packet.  SRTCP (see Section 3.4 of RFC 3711 [4]) adds extra\
    \ fields\n   (some of which are of configurable length) at the end of each RTCP\n\
    \   packet that are probably at least some 10 to 20 bytes in size (14\n   bytes\
    \ as default).  Note that extensions and transforms defined in\n   the future,\
    \ as well as the configuration of each field length, MAY\n   add greater overhead.\
    \  By using SRTP, the average size of an RTCP\n   packet will increase and thus\
    \ reduce the frequency at which (timely)\n   feedback can be provided.  Application\
    \ designers need to be aware of\n   this, and take precautions so that the RTCP\
    \ bandwidth shares are\n   maintained.  This MUST be done by adjusting the RTCP\
    \ variable\n   \"avg_rtcp_size\" to reflect the size of the SRTCP packets.\n"

    \   Announcement Protocol (SAP) [11], but may also be distributed using\n   email,\

    \ [7] and RFC\n   4568 [8].  In the following subsection, the negotiation process\
    \ is\n   described in terms of the offer/answer model.\n   Afterwards, the cases\
    \ that do not use the offer/answer model are\n   addressed: RTSP-specific negotiation\
    \ support is provided by RFC 4567\n   [7] as discussed in Section 3.3.2, and support\
    \ for SAP announcements\n   (with no negotiation at all) is addressed in Section\
    \ 3.3.3.\n"
- title: 3.3.1.  Offer/Answer-Based Negotiation of Session Descriptions
  contents:
  - "3.3.1.  Offer/Answer-Based Negotiation of Session Descriptions\n   Negotiations\
    \ (e.g., of RTP profiles, codecs, transport addresses,\n   etc.) are carried out\
    \ on a per-media session basis (e.g., per m= line\n   in SDP).  If negotiating\
    \ one media session fails, others MAY still\n   succeed.\n   Different RTP profiles\
    \ MAY be used in different media sessions.  For\n   negotiation of a media description,\
    \ the four profiles AVP, AVPF,\n   SAVP, and SAVPF are mutually exclusive.  Note,\
    \ however, that SAVP and\n   SAVPF entities MAY be mixed in a single RTP session\
    \ (see Section 4).\n   Also, the offer/answer mechanism MAY be used to offer alternatives\n\
    \   for the same media session and allow the answerer to choose one of\n   the\
    \ profiles.\n   Provided that a mechanism for offering alternative security profiles\n\
    \   becomes available (as is presently under development [14]), an\n   offerer\
    \ that is capable of supporting more than one of these profiles\n   for a certain\
    \ media session SHOULD always offer all alternatives\n   acceptable in a certain\
    \ situation.  The alternatives SHOULD be listed\n   in order of preference and\
    \ the offerer SHOULD prefer secure profiles\n   over non-secure ones.  The offer\
    \ SHOULD NOT include both a secure\n   alternative (SAVP and SAVPF) and an insecure\
    \ alternative (e.g., AVP\n   and AVPF) in the same offer as this may enable bidding\
    \ down and other\n   attacks.  Therefore, if both secure and non-secure RTP profiles\
    \ are\n   offered (e.g., for best-effort SRTP [14]), the negotiation signaling\n\
    \   MUST be protected appropriately to avoid such attacks.\n   If an offer contains\
    \ multiple alternative profiles, the answerer\n   SHOULD prefer a secure profile\
    \ (if supported) over non-secure ones.\n   Among the secure or insecure profiles,\
    \ the answerer SHOULD select the\n   first acceptable alternative to respect the\
    \ preference of the\n   offerer.\n   If a media description in an offer uses SAVPF\
    \ and the answerer does\n   not support SAVPF, the media session MUST be rejected.\n\
    \   If a media description in an offer does not use SAVPF but the\n   answerer\
    \ wants to use SAVPF, the answerer MUST reject the media\n   session.  The answerer\
    \ MAY provide a counter-offer with a media\n   description indicating SAVPF in\
    \ a subsequently initiated offer/answer\n   exchange.\n"
- title: 3.3.2.  RTSP-Based Negotiation of Session Descriptions
  contents:
  - "3.3.2.  RTSP-Based Negotiation of Session Descriptions\n   RTSP [10] does not\
    \ support the offer/answer model.  However, RTSP\n   supports exchanging media\
    \ session parameters (including profile and\n   address information) by means\
    \ of the Transport header.  SDP-based key\n   management as defined in RFC 4567\
    \ [7] adds an RTSP header (KeyMgmt)\n   to support conveying a key management\
    \ protocol (including keying\n   material).\n   The RTSP Transport header MAY\
    \ be used to determine the profile for\n   the media session.  Conceptually, the\
    \ rules defined in Section 3.3.1\n   apply accordingly.  Detailed operation is\
    \ as follows:  An SDP\n   description (e.g., retrieved from the RTSP server by\
    \ means of\n   DESCRIBE) contains the description of the media streams of the\n\
    \   particular RTSP resource.\n   The RTSP client MUST select exactly one of the\
    \ profiles per media\n   stream it wants to receive.  It MUST do so in the SETUP\
    \ request.  The\n   RTSP client MUST indicate the chosen RTP profile by indicating\
    \ the\n   profile and the full server transport address (IP address and port\n\
    \   number) in the Transport header included in the SETUP request.  The\n   RTSP\
    \ server's response to the client's SETUP message MUST confirm\n   this profile\
    \ selection or refuse the SETUP request (the latter of\n   which it should not\
    \ do after offering the profiles in the first\n   place).\n        Note: To change\
    \ any of the profiles in use, the client needs to\n        tear down this media\
    \ stream (and possibly the whole RTSP\n        session) using the TEARDOWN method\
    \ and re-establish it using\n        SETUP.  This may change as soon as media\
    \ updating (similar to a\n        SIP UPDATE or re-INVITE) becomes specified.\n\
    \   When using the SDP key management [7], the KeyMgmt header MUST be\n   included\
    \ in the appropriate RTSP messages if a secure profile is\n   chosen.  If different\
    \ secure profiles are offered in the SDP\n   description (e.g., SAVP and SAVPF)\
    \ and different keying material is\n   provided for these, after choosing one\
    \ profile in the SETUP message,\n   only the KeyMgmt header for the chosen one\
    \ MUST be provided.  The\n   rules for matching KeyMgmt headers to media streams\
    \ according to RFC\n   4567 [7] apply.\n"

  contents:
  - "3.3.3.  Announcing Session Descriptions\n   Protocols that do not allow negotiating\

    \ on a web page or\n   sent by mail) pose the responsibility for adequate access\
    \ to the\n   media sessions on the initiator of a session.\n   The initiator SHOULD\
    \ provide alternative session descriptions for\n   multiple RTP profiles as far\
    \ as acceptable to the application and the\n   purpose of the session.  If security\
    \ is desired, SAVP may be offered\n   as alternative to SAVPF -- but AVP or AVPF\
    \ sessions SHOULD NOT be\n   announced unless other security means not relying\
    \ on SRTP are\n   employed.\n   The SDP attributes defined in RFC 4567 [7] and\
    \ RFC 4568 [8] may also\n   be used for the security parameter distribution of\
    \ announced session\n   descriptions.\n   The security scheme description defined\
    \ in RFC 4568 [8] requires a\n   secure communications channel to prevent third\
    \ parties from\n   eavesdropping on the keying parameters and manipulation.  Therefore,\n\
    \   SAP security (as defined in RFC 2974 [11]), S/MIME [12], HTTPS [13],\n   or\

  contents:
  - "4.  Interworking of AVP, SAVP, AVPF, and SAVPF Entities\n   The SAVPF profile\
    \ defined in this document is a combination of the\n   SAVP profile [4] and the\
    \ AVPF profile [3] (which in turn is an\n   extension of the RTP profile as defined\
    \ in RFC 3551 [2]).\n   SAVP and SAVPF use SRTP [4] to achieve security.  AVP\
    \ and AVPF use\n   plain RTP [1] and hence do not provide security (unless external\n\
    \   security mechanisms are applied as discussed in Section 9.1 of RFC\n   3550\
    \ [1]).  SRTP and RTP are not meant to interoperate; the\n   respective protocol\
    \ entities are not supposed to be part of the same\n   RTP session.  Hence, AVP\
    \ and AVPF on one side and SAVP and SAVPF on\n   the other MUST NOT be mixed.\n\
    \   RTP entities using the SAVP and the SAVPF profiles MAY be mixed in a\n   single\
    \ RTP session.  The interworking considerations defined in\n   Section 5 of RFC\
    \ 4585 [3] apply.\n"
- title: 5.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "5.  Security Considerations\n   The SAVPF profile inherits its security properties\
    \ from the SAVP\n   profile; therefore, it is subject to the security considerations\n\
    \   discussed in RFC 3711 [4].  When compared to SAVP, the SAVPF profile\n   does\
    \ not add or take away any security services.\n   There is a desire to support\
    \ security for media streams and, at the\n   same time, for backward compatibility\
    \ with non-SAVP(F) nodes.\n   Application designers should be aware that security\
    \ SHOULD NOT be\n   traded for interoperability.  If information is to be distributed\
    \ to\n   closed groups (i.e., confidentially protected), it is RECOMMENDED not\n\
    \   to offer alternatives for a media session other than SAVP and SAVPF\n   as\
    \ described in Sections 3.3 and 3.4, unless other security\n   mechanisms will\
    \ be used, e.g., the ones described in Section 9.1 of\n   RFC 3550 [1].  Similarly,\
    \ if integrity protection is considered\n   important, it is RECOMMENDED not to\
    \ offer the alternatives other than\n   SAVP and SAVPF, unless other mechanisms\
    \ are known to be in place that\n   can guarantee it, e.g., lower-layer mechanisms\
    \ as described in\n   Section 9 of RFC 3550 [1].\n   Offering secure and insecure\
    \ profiles simultaneously may open to\n   bidding down attacks.  Therefore, such\
    \ a mix of profile offer SHOULD\n   NOT be made.\n   Note that the rules for sharing\
    \ master keys apply as described in RFC\n   3711 [4] (e.g., Section 9.1).  In\
    \ particular, the same rules for\n   avoiding the two-time pad (keystream reuse)\
    \ apply: a master key MUST\n   NOT be shared among different RTP sessions unless\
    \ the SSRCs used are\n   unique across all the RTP streams of the RTP sessions\
    \ that share the\n   same master key.\n   When 2^48 SRTP packets or 2^31 SRTCP\
    \ packets have been secured with\n   the same key (whichever occurs before), the\
    \ key management MUST be\n   called to provide new master key(s) (previously stored\
    \ and used keys\n   MUST NOT be used again), or the session MUST be terminated.\n\
    \   Different media sessions may use a mix of different profiles,\n   particularly\
    \ including a secure profile and an insecure profile.\n   However, mixing secure\
    \ and insecure media sessions may reveal\n   information to third parties and\
    \ thus the decision to do so MUST be\n   in line with a local security policy.\
    \  For example, the local policy\n   MUST specify whether it is acceptable to\
    \ have, e.g., the audio stream\n   not secured and the related video secured.\n\
    \   The security considerations in RFC 4585 [3] are valid, too.  Note in\n   particular,\
    \ applying the SAVPF profile implies mandatory integrity\n   protection on RTCP.\
    \  While this solves the problem of false packets\n   from members not belonging\
    \ to the group, it does not solve the issues\n   related to a malicious member\
    \ acting improperly.\n"
