  - "IESG NOTE\n   The IMAP extension described here assumes a particular means of\
    \ using\n   IMAP to support disconnected operation.  However, this means of\n\
    \   supporting disconnected operation is not yet documented.  Also, there\n  \
    \ are multiple theories about how best to do disconnected operation in\n   IMAP,\
    \ and as yet, there is no consensus on which one should be\n   adopted as a standard.\n\
    \   This document is being approved as a Proposed Standard because it\n   does\
    \ not appear to have technical flaws in itelf.  However, approval\n   of this\
    \ document as a Proposed Standard should not be considered an\n   IETF endorsement\
    \ of any particular means of doing disconnected\n   operation in IMAP.\n"

  - "1.   Abstract\n   The UIDPLUS extension of the Internet Message Access Protocol\
    \ [IMAP4]\n   provides a set of features intended to reduce the amount of time\
    \ and\n   resources used by some client operations.  The features in UIDPLUS\n\
    \   are primarily intended for disconnected-use clients.\n"

- title: 3.   Introduction and Overview
  contents:
  - "3.   Introduction and Overview\n   The UIDPLUS extension is present in any IMAP4\
    \ server implementation\n   which returns \"UIDPLUS\" as one of the supported\
    \ capabilities to the\n   CAPABILITY command.  The UIDPLUS extension contains\
    \ one additional\n   command and additional data returned with successful APPEND\
    \ and COPY\n   commands.\n   Clients that wish to use the new command in UIDPLUS\
    \ must of course\n   first test for the presence of the extension by issuing a\
    \ CAPABILITY\n   command.  Each of the features in UIDPLUS are optimizations;\
    \ clients\n   can provide the same functionality, albeit more slowly, by using\n\
    \   commands in the base protocol.  With each feature, this document\n   recommends\
    \ a fallback approach to take when the UIDPLUS extension is\n   not supported\
    \ by the server.\n"

- title: 4.1. UID EXPUNGE Command
  contents:
  - "4.1. UID EXPUNGE Command\n   Arguments:  message set\n   Data:       untagged\
    \ responses: EXPUNGE\n   Result:     OK - expunge completed\n               NO\
    \ - expunge failure (e.g. permission denied)\n               BAD - command unknown\
    \ or arguments invalid\n      The UID EXPUNGE command permanently removes from\
    \ the currently\n      selected mailbox all messages that both have the \\Deleted\
    \ flag set\n      and have a UID that is included in the specified message set.\
    \  If\n      a message either does not have the \\Deleted flag set or is has a\n\
    \      UID that is not included in the specified message set, it is not\n    \
    \  affected.\n      This command may be used to ensure that a replayed EXPUNGE\
    \ command\n      does not remove any messages that have been marked as \\Deleted\n\
    \      between the time that the user requested the expunge operation and\n  \
    \    the time the server processes the command.\n      If the server does not\
    \ support the UIDPLUS capability, the client\n      should fall back to using\
    \ the STORE command to temporarily remove\n      the \\Deleted flag from messages\
    \ it does not want to remove.  The\n      client could alternatively fall back\
    \ to using the EXPUNGE command,\n      risking the unintended removal of some\
    \ messages.\n   Example:    C: A003 UID EXPUNGE 3000:3002\n               S: *\
    \ 3 EXPUNGE\n               S: * 3 EXPUNGE\n               S: * 3 EXPUNGE\n  \
    \             S: A003 OK UID EXPUNGE completed\n"
- title: 4.2. APPENDUID response code
  contents:
  - "4.2. APPENDUID response code\n   Successful APPEND commands return an APPENDUID\
    \ response code in the\n   tagged OK response.  The APPENDUID response code contains\
    \ as\n   arguments the UIDVALIDITY of the destination mailbox and the UID\n  \
    \ assigned to the appended message.\n   If the server does not support the UIDPLUS\
    \ capability, the client can\n   only discover this information by selecting the\
    \ destination mailbox\n   and issuing FETCH commands.\n   Example:    C: A003\
    \ APPEND saved-messages (\\Seen) {310}\n               C: Date: Mon, 7 Feb 1994\

    \ APPEND completed\n"
- title: 4.3. COPYUID response code
  contents:
  - "4.3. COPYUID response code\n   Successful COPY and UID COPY commands return a\
    \ COPYUID response code\n   in the tagged OK response whenever at least one message\
    \ was copied.\n   The COPYUID response code contains as an argument the UIDVALIDITY\
    \ of\n   the appended-to mailbox, a message set containing the UIDs of the\n \
    \  messages copied to the destination mailbox, in the order they were\n   copied,\
    \ and a message containing the UIDs assigned to the copied\n   messages, in the\
    \ order they were assigned.  Neither of the message\n   sets may contain extraneous\
    \ UIDs or the symbol '*'.\n   If the server does not support the UIDPLUS capability,\
    \ the client can\n   only discover this information by selecting the destination\
    \ mailbox\n   and issuing FETCH commands.\n   Example:    C: A003 COPY 2:4 MEETING\n\
    \               S: A003 OK [COPYUID 38505 304,319:320 3956:3958] Done\n      \
