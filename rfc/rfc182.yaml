  - "              COMPILATION OF LIST OF RELEVANT SITE REPORTS\n   The Network Information\
    \ Center is working to compile a list of all\n   Site-produced reports which are\
    \ of interest to Network participants.\n   Reports procuced under ARPA IPT contracts\
    \ and any other relevant\n   reports produced by the Sites on information processing,\
    \ network\n   planning, the hardware and sorfware for the projects, and some\n\
    \   general reports on the subject concerns of individual Sites, are\n   being\
    \ identified, to be listed and acquired for the Network\n   Information Center\
    \ collection.\n   In an initial effort to gather information, NIC requested the\
    \ first\n   Station Agents to send copies of any existing bibliographies of their\n\
    \   Site's reports.  Since then, other efforts have occupied NIC's time,\n   and\
    \ the projeted bibliography of network reports is not yet issued.\n   In the meantime,\
    \ several Agents have sent lists of their Site's\n   reports, and Peggy Karp's\
    \ bibliography has covered much of the\n   ground.  In the meantime, also, the\
    \ expected demand for a compilation\n   of references and for an accessible collection\
    \ of the actual reports\n   has developed.  NIC has responsibility to satisfy\
    \ this demand from\n   Sites for other relevant reports, to allow Sites to refer\
    \ requests\n   for their own reports to the NIC for centralized handling, and\
    \ to\n   provide Sites and others with bibliographic tools to facilitate\n   reference\
    \ to all Network reports.\n   Requests from inside or outside the Network for\
    \ reports performed\n   under an ARPA IPT Contract may be forwarded or referred\
    \ to NIC for\n   answer.  NIC will not attempt to supply copies to outsiders,\
    \ but will\n   answer the request with information for ordering from government\n\
    \   where this information is known, or will refer the request to the\n   report's\
    \ originator when necessary.\n   NIC would appreciate receiving any other existing\
    \ bibliographies of\n   relevant Site-produced reports.\n   NIC would also appreciate\
    \ being placed on distribution lists for new\n   relevant Site-produced reports.\n\
