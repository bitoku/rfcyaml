  - "Abstract\n   This document defines the format for literal IPv6 Addresses in URL's\n\
    \   for implementation in World Wide Web browsers.  This format has been\n   implemented\
    \ in the IPv6 versions of several widely deployed browsers\n   including Microsoft\
    \ Internet Explorer, Mozilla, and Lynx.  It is also\n   intended to be used in\
    \ the IPv6 version of the service location\n   protocol.\n   This document incudes\
    \ an update to the generic syntax for Uniform\n   Resource Identifiers defined\
    \ in RFC 2396 [URL].  It defines a syntax\n   for IPv6 addresses and allows the\
    \ use of \"[\" and \"]\" within a URI\n   explicitly for this reserved purpose.\n"
- title: 1. Introduction
  contents:
  - "1. Introduction\n   The textual representation defined for literal IPv6 addresses\
    \ in\n   [ARCH] is not directly compatible with URL's.  Both use \":\" and \"\
    .\"\n   characters as delimiters.  This document defines the format for\n   literal\
    \ IPv6 Addresses in URL's for implementation in World Wide Web\n   browsers. \
    \ The goal is to have a format that allows easy \"cut\" and\n   \"paste\" operations\
    \ with a minimum of editing of the literal address.\n   The format defined in\
    \ this document has been implemented in the IPv6\n   versions of several widely\
    \ deployed browsers including Microsoft\n   Internet Explorer, Mozilla, and Lynx.\
    \  It is also intended to be used\n   in the IPv6 version of the service location\
    \ protocol.\n"

    \ SHOULD,\n   SHOULD NOT, RECOMMENDED, MAY, and OPTIONAL, if and where they appear\n\
    \   in this document, are to be interpreted as described in [KEYWORDS].\n   World\
    \ Wide Web browsers SHOULD implement the format of IPv6 literals\n   in URL's\
    \ defined in this document.  Other types of applications and\n   protocols that\
    \ use URL's MAY use this format.\n"
- title: 2. Literal IPv6 Address Format in URL's Syntax
  contents:
  - "2. Literal IPv6 Address Format in URL's Syntax\n   To use a literal IPv6 address\
    \ in a URL, the literal address should be\n   enclosed in \"[\" and \"]\" characters.\
    \  For example the following\n   literal IPv6 addresses:\n      FEDC:BA98:7654:3210:FEDC:BA98:7654:3210\n\
    \      1080:0:0:0:8:800:200C:4171\n      3ffe:2a00:100:7031::1\n      1080::8:800:200C:417A\n\
    \      ::192.9.5.5\n      ::FFFF:129.144.52.38\n      2010:836B:4179::836B:4179\n\
    \   would be represented as in the following example URLs:\n      http://[FEDC:BA98:7654:3210:FEDC:BA98:7654:3210]:80/index.html\n\
    \      http://[1080:0:0:0:8:800:200C:417A]/index.html\n      http://[3ffe:2a00:100:7031::1]\n\
    \      http://[1080::8:800:200C:417A]/foo\n      http://[::192.9.5.5]/ipng\n \
    \     http://[::FFFF:129.144.52.38]:80/index.html\n      http://[2010:836B:4179::836B:4179]\n"

  contents:
  - "3. Changes to RFC 2396\n   This document updates the generic syntax for Uniform\
    \ Resource\n   Identifiers defined in RFC 2396 [URL].  It defines a syntax for\
    \ IPv6\n   addresses and allows the use of \"[\" and \"]\" within a URI explicitly\n\
    \   for this reserved purpose.\n   The following changes to the syntax in RFC\
    \ 2396 are made:\n   (1) change the 'host' non-terminal to add an IPv6 option:\n\
    \      host          = hostname | IPv4address | IPv6reference\n      ipv6reference\
    \ = \"[\" IPv6address \"]\"\n   where IPv6address is defined as in RFC2373 [ARCH].\n\
    \   (2) Replace the definition of 'IPv4address' with that of RFC 2373, as\n  \
    \ it correctly defines an IPv4address as consisting of at most three\n   decimal\
    \ digits per segment.\n   (3) Add \"[\" and \"]\" to the set of 'reserved' characters:\n\
    \      reserved    = \";\" | \"/\" | \"?\" | \":\" | \"@\" | \"&\" | \"=\" | \"\
    +\" |\n                    \"$\" | \",\" | \"[\" | \"]\"\n   and remove them from\
    \ the 'unwise' set:\n      unwise      = \"{\" | \"}\" | \"|\" | \"\\\" | \"^\"\
    \ | \"`\"\n"
