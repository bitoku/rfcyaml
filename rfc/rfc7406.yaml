  - "1.  Introduction\n   Summoning police, the fire department, or an ambulance in\
    \ emergencies\n   is one of the fundamental and most-valued functions of the telephone.\n\
    \   As telephony functionality moves from circuit-switched telephony to\n   Internet\
    \ telephony, its users rightfully expect that this core\n   functionality will\
    \ continue to work at least as well as it has for\n   the older technology.  New\
    \ devices and services are being made\n   available that could be used to make\
    \ a request for help; those\n   devices are not traditional telephones, and users\
    \ are increasingly\n   expecting them to be able to place emergency calls.\n \
    \  Roughly speaking, the IETF emergency services architecture (see\n   [RFC6881]\
    \ and [RFC6443]) divides responsibility for handling\n   emergency calls among\
    \ the access network (Internet Access Provider\n   (IAP) or ISP); the application\
    \ service provider (ASP), which may be a\n   VoIP service provider (VSP); and\
    \ the provider of emergency signaling\n   services, the emergency service network\
    \ (ESN).  The access network\n   may provide location information to end systems\
    \ but does not have to\n   provide any ASP signaling functionality.  The emergency\
    \ caller can\n   reach the ESN either directly or through the ASP's outbound proxy.\n\
    \   Any of the three parties can provide the mapping from location to the\n  \
    \ Public Safety Answering Point (PSAP) URI by offering Location-to-\n   Service\
    \ Translation (LoST) [RFC5222] services.\n   In general, a set of automated configuration\
    \ mechanisms allows a\n   device to function in a variety of architectures, without\
    \ the user\n   being aware of the details on who provides location, mapping\n\
    \   services, or call-routing services.  However, if emergency calling is\n  \
    \ to be supported when the calling device lacks access network\n   authorization\
    \ or does not have an ASP, one or more of the providers\n   may need to provide\
    \ additional services and functions.\n   In all cases, the end device has to be\
    \ able to perform a LoST lookup\n   and otherwise conduct the emergency call in\
    \ the same manner as when\n   the three exceptional conditions discussed below\
    \ do not apply.\n   We distinguish among three conditions:\n   No Access Authentication\
    \ (NAA):  In the NAA case, the emergency\n      caller does not posses valid credentials\
    \ for the access network.\n      This includes the case where the access network\
    \ allows\n      pay-per-use, as is common for wireless hotspots, but there is\n\
    \      insufficient time to enter credit card details and other\n      registration\
    \ information required for access.  It also covers all\n      cases where either\
    \ no credentials are available at all or the\n      available credentials do not\
    \ work for the given IAP/ISP.  As a\n      result, the NAA case basically combines\
    \ the No ASP (NASP) and\n      zero-balance ASP (ZBP) cases below, but at the\
    \ IAP/ISP level.\n      Support for emergency call handling in the NAA case is\
    \ subject to\n      the local policy of the ISP.  Such policy may vary substantially\n\
    \      between ISPs and typically depends on external factors that are\n     \
    \ not under the ISP control.\n   No ASP (NASP):  The caller does not have an ASP\
    \ at the time of the\n      call.  This can occur in case the caller either does\
    \ not possess\n      any valid subscription for a reachable ASP or does possess\
    \ a valid\n      subscription but none of the ASPs are reachable through the ISP.\n\
    \      Note: The interoperability need is increased with this scenario\n     \
    \ since the client software used by the emergency caller must be\n      compatible\
    \ with the protocols and extensions deployed by the ESN.\n   Zero-balance ASP\
    \ (ZBP):  In the case of a zero-balance ASP, the ASP\n      can authenticate the\
    \ caller, but the caller is not authorized to\n      use ASP services, e.g., because\
    \ the contract has expired or the\n      prepaid account for the customer has\
    \ been depleted.\n   These three cases are not mutually exclusive.  A caller in\
    \ need of\n   help may, for example, be both in an NAA and NASP situation, as\n\
    \   explained in more detail in Figure 1.  Depending on local policy and\n   regulations,\
    \ it may not be possible to place emergency calls in the\n   NAA case.  Unless\
    \ local regulations require user identification, it\n   should always be possible\
    \ to place calls in the NASP case, with\n   minimal impact on the ISP.  Unless\
    \ the ESN requires that all calls\n   traverse a known set of Voice Service Providers\
    \ (VSPs), it is\n   technically possible to let a caller place an emergency call\
    \ in the\n   ZBP case.  We discuss each case in more detail in Section 3.\n  \
    \ Some of the functionality provided in this document is already\n   available\
    \ in the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN).\n   Consequently, there is\
    \ real-world experience available and not all of\n   it is positive.  For example,\
    \ the functionality of calls without\n   Subscriber Identity Modules (SIMs) in\
    \ today's cellular system has\n   lead to a fair amount of hoax or test calls\
    \ in certain countries.\n   This causes overload situations at PSAPs, which is\
    \ considered harmful\n   to the overall availability and reliability of emergency\
    \ services.\n      As an example, the Federal Office of Communications (OFCOM,\n\
    \      Switzerland) provided statistics about emergency (112) calls in\n     \
    \ Switzerland from Jan. 1997 to Nov. 2001.  Switzerland did not\n      offer SIM-less\
    \ emergency calls except for almost a month in July\n      2000 where a significant\
    \ increase in hoax and test calls was\n      reported.  As a consequence, the\
    \ functionality was disabled again.\n      More details can be found in the panel\
    \ presentations of the 3rd\n      Standards Development Organization (SDO) Emergency\
    \ Services\n      Workshop [esw07].\n"

  - "3.  Use-Case Categories\n   An end host needs to perform the following steps\
    \ if it is not\n   attached to the network and the user is starting to place an\n\
    \   emergency call:\n   Link-Layer Attachment:  Some networks have added support\
    \ for\n      unauthenticated emergency access while others have advertised\n \
    \     these capabilities using layer beacons (multicast or broadcast\n      announcements).\
    \  The end host learns about these unauthenticated\n      emergency services capabilities\
    \ from either the link layer type or\n      advertisement.\n      The end host\
    \ uses the link-layer-specific network attachment\n      procedures defined for\
    \ unauthenticated network access in order to\n      get access to the network.\n\
    \   Pre-emergency Service Configuration:  When the link-layer network\n      attachment\
    \ procedure is completed, the end host learns basic\n      configuration information\
    \ using DHCP from the ISP.  The end host\n      uses a Location Configuration\
    \ Protocol (LCP) to retrieve location\n      information.  Subsequently, the LoST\
    \ protocol [RFC5222] is used to\n      learn the relevant emergency numbers and\
    \ to obtain the PSAP URI\n      applicable for that location.\n   Emergency Call:\
    \  In case of the need for help, a user dials an\n      emergency number and the\
    \ SIP User Agent (UA) initiates the\n      emergency call procedures by communicating\
    \ with the PSAP.\n   Figure 1 compiles the basic logic taking place during network\
    \ entry\n   for requesting an emergency service and shows the interrelation\n\
    \   between the three conditions described earlier.\n                        \

- title: 4.  ZBP Considerations
  contents:
  - "4.  ZBP Considerations\n   ZBP includes all cases where a subscriber is known\
    \ to an ASP but\n   lacks the necessary authorization to access regular ASP services.\n\
    \   Example ZBP cases include empty prepaid accounts, barred accounts,\n   roaming\
    \ and mobility restrictions, or any other conditions set by ASP\n   policy.\n\
    \   Local regulation might demand that emergency calls cannot proceed\n   without\
    \ successful service authorization.  In some regulatory\n   regimes, however,\
    \ it may be possible to allow emergency calls to\n   continue despite authorization\
    \ failures.  To distinguish an emergency\n   call from a regular call, an ASP\
    \ can identify emergency sessions by\n   inspecting the service URN [RFC5031]\
    \ used in call setup.  The ZBP\n   case, therefore, only affects the ASP.\n  \
    \ Permitting a call despite authorization failures could present an\n   opportunity\
    \ for abuse.  The ASP may choose to verify the destination\n   of the emergency\
    \ calls and to only permit calls to certain,\n   preconfigured entities (e.g.,\
    \ to local PSAPs).  Section 7 discusses\n   this topic in more detail.\n   An\
    \ ASP without a regulatory requirement to authorize emergency calls\n   can deny\
    \ emergency call setup.  Where an ASP does not authorize an\n   emergency call,\
    \ the caller may be able to fall back to NASP\n   procedures.\n"
- title: 5.  NASP Considerations
  contents:
  - "5.  NASP Considerations\n   To start the description, we consider the sequence\
    \ of steps that are\n   executed in an emergency call based on Figure 5.\n   o\
    \  As an initial step, the devices attach to the network as shown in\n      step\
    \ (1).  This step is outside the scope of this section.\n   o  When the link-layer\
    \ network attachment procedure is completed, the\n      end host learns basic\
    \ IP configuration information using DHCP from\n      the ISP, as shown in step\
    \ (2).\n   o  When the end host has configured the IP address, it starts an\n\
    \      interaction with the discovered LCS at the ISP, as shown in step\n    \
    \  (3).  In certain deployments, the ISP may need to interact with\n      the\
    \ IAP.  This protocol exchange is shown in step (4).\n   o  Once location information\
    \ is obtained, the end host triggers the\n      LoST protocol to obtain the address\
    \ of the ESRP/PSAP.  This is\n      shown in step (5).\n   o  In step (6), the\
    \ SIP UA initiates a SIP INVITE request towards the\n      indicated ESRP.  The\
    \ INVITE message contains all the necessary\n      parameters required by Section\
    \ 5.1.5.\n   o  The ESRP receives the INVITE and processes it according to the\n\
    \      description in Section 5.3.3.\n   o  The ESRP routes the call to the PSAP,\
    \ as shown in step (8),\n      potentially interacting with a LoST server first\
    \ to determine the\n      route.\n   o  The PSAP evaluates the initial INVITE\
    \ and aims to complete the\n      call setup.\n   o  Finally, when the call setup\
    \ is completed, media traffic can be\n      exchanged between the PSAP and the\
    \ SIP UA.\n   For brevity, the end-to-end SIP and media exchange between the PSAP\n\
    \   and SIP UA are not shown in Figure 5.\n                                  +-------+\n\

  - "6.  Lower-Layer Considerations for NAA Case\n   Some networks have added support\
    \ for unauthenticated emergency access\n   while others have advertised these\
    \ capabilities using layer beacons.\n   The end host learns about these unauthenticated\
    \ emergency services\n   capabilities either from the link-layer type or from\
    \ advertisement.\n   It is important to highlight that the NAA case is inherently\
    \ a Layer\n   2 problem, and the general form of the solution is to provide an\n\
    \   \"emergency only\" access type, with appropriate limits or monitoring\n  \
    \ to prevent abuse.  The described mechanisms are informative in nature\n   since\
    \ the relationship to the IETF emergency services architecture is\n   only indirect,\
    \ namely via some protocols developed within the IETF\n   (e.g., EAP and EAP methods)\
    \ that require extensions to support this\n   functionality.\n   This section\
    \ discusses different methods to indicate an emergency\n   service request as\
    \ part of network attachment.  It provides some\n   general considerations and\
    \ recommendations that are not specific to\n   the access technology.\n   To perform\
    \ network attachment and get access to the resources\n   provided by an IAP/ISP,\
    \ the end host uses access technology-specific\n   network attachment procedures,\
    \ including, for example, network\n   detection and selection, authentication,\
    \ and authorization.  For\n   initial network attachment of an emergency service\
    \ requester, the\n   method of how the emergency indication is given to the IAP/ISP\
    \ is\n   specific to the access technology.  However, a number of general\n  \
    \ approaches can be identified:\n   Link-layer emergency indication:  The end\
    \ host provides an\n      indication, e.g., an emergency parameter or flag, as\
    \ part of the\n      link-layer signaling for initial network attachment.  Examples\n\
    \      include an emergency bit signaled in the IEEE 802.16-2009 wireless\n  \
    \    link.  In IEEE 802.11 WLAN [IEEE802.11], an emergency support\n      indicator\
    \ allows the station (i.e., end host in this context) to\n      download before\
    \ association to a Network Access Identifier (NAI),\n      which it can use to\
    \ request server-side authentication only for an\n      IEEE 802.1X network.\n\
    \   Higher-layer emergency indication:  Typically, emergency indication\n    \
    \  is provided in the network access authentication procedure.  The\n      emergency\
    \ caller's end host provides an indication as part of the\n      access authentication\
    \ exchanges.  Authentication via the EAP\n      [RFC3748] is of particular relevance\
    \ here.  Examples are the EAP\n      NAI decoration used in Worldwide Interoperability\
    \ for Microwave\n      Access (WiMAX) networks and modification of the authentication\n\
    \      exchange in IEEE 802.11 [nwgstg3].\n"
- title: 6.1.  Link-Layer Emergency Indication
  contents:
  - "6.1.  Link-Layer Emergency Indication\n   In general, link-layer emergency indications\
    \ provide good integration\n   into the actual network access procedure regarding\
    \ the enabling of\n   means to recognize and prioritize an emergency service request\
    \ from\n   an end host at a very early stage of the network attachment\n   procedure.\
    \  However, support in end hosts for such methods cannot be\n   considered to\
    \ be commonly available.\n   No general recommendations are given in the scope\
    \ of this memo due to\n   the following reasons:\n   o  Dependency on the specific\
    \ access technology.\n   o  Dependency on the specific access network architecture.\
    \  Access\n      authorization and policy decisions typically happen at different\n\
    \      layers of the protocol stack and in different entities than those\n   \
    \   terminating the link-layer signaling.  As a result, link-layer\n      indications\
    \ need to be distributed and translated between the\n      different protocol\
    \ layers and entities involved.  Appropriate\n      methods are specific to the\
    \ actual architecture of the IAP/ISP\n      network.\n   o  An advantage of combining\
    \ emergency indications with the actual\n      network attachment procedure performing\
    \ authentication and\n      authorization is the fact that the emergency indication\
    \ can\n      directly be taken into account in the authentication and\n      authorization\
    \ server that owns the policy for granting access to\n      the network resources.\
    \  As a result, there is no direct dependency\n      on the access network architecture\
    \ that otherwise would need to\n      take care of merging link-layer indications\
    \ into the\n      authentication, authorization, and policy decision process.\n\
    \   o  EAP signaling happens at a relatively early stage of network\n      attachment,\
    \ so it is likely to match most requirements for\n      prioritization of emergency\
    \ signaling.  However, it does not cover\n      early stages of link-layer activity\
    \ in the network attachment\n      process.  Possible conflicts may arise, e.g.,\
    \ in case of filtering\n      based on Media Access Control (MAC) in entities\
    \ terminating link-\n      layer signaling in the network (like a base station).\
    \  In normal\n      operation, EAP-related information will only be recognized\
    \ in the\n      Network Access Server (NAS).  Any entity residing between the\
    \ end\n      host and NAS should not be expected to understand/parse EAP\n   \
    \   messages.\n   o  An emergency indication can be given by forming a specific\
    \ NAI\n      that is used as the identity in EAP-based authentication for\n  \
    \    network entry.\n"
- title: 6.2.  Securing Network Attachment in NAA Cases
  contents:
  - "6.2.  Securing Network Attachment in NAA Cases\n   For network attachment in\
    \ NAA cases, it may make sense to secure the\n   link-layer connection between\
    \ the device and the IAP/ISP.  This\n   especially holds for wireless access with\
    \ examples being access based\n   on IEEE 802.11 or IEEE 802.16.  The latter even\
    \ mandates secured\n   communication across the wireless link for all IAP/ISP\
    \ networks based\n   on [nwgstg3].\n   Therefore, for network attachment that\
    \ is by default based on EAP\n   authentication, it is desirable also for NAA\
    \ network attachment to\n   use a key-generating EAP method (that provides a Master\
    \ Session Key\n   (MSK) to the authenticator to bootstrap further key derivation\
    \ for\n   protecting the wireless link).\n   To match the above, the following\
    \ approaches can be identified:\n   1) Server-Only Authentication:\n      The\
    \ device of the emergency service requester performs an EAP\n      method with\
    \ the IAP/ISP EAP server that performs server-side\n      authentication only.\
    \  An example for this is EAP-TLS [RFC5216].\n      This provides a certain level\
    \ of assurance about the IAP/ISP to\n      the device user.  It requires the device\
    \ to be provisioned with\n      appropriate trusted root certificates to be able\
    \ to verify the\n      server certificate of the EAP server (unless this step\
    \ is\n      explicitly skipped in the device in case of an emergency service\n\
    \      request).  This method is used to provide access of devices\n      without\
    \ existing credentials to an IEEE 802.1X network.  The\n      details are incorporated\
    \ in the IEEE 802.11-2012 specification\n      [IEEE802.11].\n   2) Null Authentication:\n\
    \      In one case (e.g., WiMAX), an EAP method is performed.  However,\n    \
    \  no credentials specific to either the server or the device or\n      subscription\
    \ are used as part of the authentication exchange.  An\n      example for this\
    \ would be an EAP-TLS exchange using the\n      TLS_DH_anon (anonymous) ciphersuite.\
    \  Alternatively, a publicly\n      available static key for emergency access\
    \ could be used.  In the\n      latter case, the device would need to be provisioned\
    \ with the\n      appropriate emergency key for the IAP/ISP in advance.  In another\n\
    \      case (e.g., IEEE 802.11), no EAP method is used, so that empty\n      frames\
    \ are transported during the over-the-air IEEE 802.1X\n      exchange.  In this\
    \ case, the authentication state machine\n      completes with no cryptographic\
    \ keys being exchanged.\n   3) Device Authentication:\n      This case extends\
    \ the server-only authentication case.  If the\n      device is configured with\
    \ a device certificate and the IAP/ISP EAP\n      server can rely on a trusted\
    \ root allowing the EAP server to\n      verify the device certificate, at least\
    \ the device identity (e.g.,\n      the MAC address) can be authenticated by the\
    \ IAP/ISP in NAA cases.\n      An example for this is WiMAX devices that are shipped\
    \ with device\n      certificates issued under the global WiMAX device public-key\n\
    \      infrastructure.  To perform unauthenticated emergency calls, if\n     \
    \ allowed by the IAP/ISP, such devices perform network attachment\n      based\
    \ on EAP-TLS with client authentication based on the device\n      certificate.\n"
- title: 7.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "7.  Security Considerations\n   The security threats discussed in [RFC5069] are\
    \ applicable to this\n   document.\n   The NASP and NAA cases introduce new vulnerabilities\
    \ since the PSAP\n   operator will typically not have any information about the\
    \ identity\n   of the caller via the signaling path.  Today, in countries where\
    \ this\n   functionality is used for Global System for Mobile Communications\n\
    \   (GSM) networks, this has lead to a significant amount of misuse.\n   In the\
    \ context of NAA, the IAP and the ISP will probably want to make\n   sure that\
    \ the claimed emergency caller indeed performs an emergency\n   call rather than\
    \ using the network for other purposes, and thereby\n   acting fraudulent by skipping\
    \ any authentication, authorization, and\n   accounting procedures.  By restricting\
    \ access of the unauthenticated\n   emergency caller to the LoST server and the\
    \ PSAP URI, traffic can be\n   restricted only to emergency calls.  This can be\
    \ accomplished with\n   traffic separation.  However, the details, e.g., for using\
    \ filtering,\n   depend on the deployed ISP architecture and are beyond the scope\
    \ of\n   this document.\n   We only illustrate a possible model.  If the ISP runs\
    \ its own\n   (caching) LoST server, the ISP would maintain an access control\
    \ list\n   populated with IP-address information obtained from LoST responses\n\
    \   (in the mappings).  These URIs would either be URIs for contacting\n   further\
    \ LoST servers or PSAP URIs.  It may be necessary to translate\n   domain names\
    \ returned in LoST responses to IP addresses.  Since the\n   media destination\
    \ addresses are not predictable, the ISP also has to\n   provide a SIP outbound\
    \ proxy so that it can determine the media\n   addresses and add those to the\
    \ filter list.\n   For the ZBP case, the additional aspect of fraud has to be\n\
    \   considered.  Unless the emergency call traverses a PSTN gateway or\n   the\
    \ ASP charges for IP-to-IP calls, there is little potential for\n   fraud.  If\
    \ the ASP also operates the LoST server, the outbound proxy\n   MAY restrict outbound\
    \ calls to the SIP URIs returned by the LoST\n   server.  It is NOT RECOMMENDED\
    \ to rely on a fixed list of SIP URIs,\n   as that list may change.\n   RFC 6280\
    \ [RFC6280] discusses security vulnerabilities that are caused\n   by an adversary\
    \ faking location information and thereby lying about\n   the actual location\
    \ of the emergency caller.  These threats may be\n   less problematic in the context\
    \ of an unauthenticated emergency when\n   location information can be verified\
    \ by the ISP to fall within a\n   specific geographical area.\n"
