  title: Status of This Memo
- contents:
  - "Abstract\n   Border Gateway Protocol [1] is an inter-autonomous system routing\n
    \  protocol designed for TCP/IP internets.\n   This document describes an extension
    to BGP which may be used to pass\n   additional information to both neighboring
    and remote BGP peers.\n   The intention of the proposed technique is to aid in
    policy\n   administration and reduce the management complexity of maintaining\n
    \  the Internet.\n"
  title: Abstract
- contents:
  - "Introduction\n   BGP supports transit policies via controlled distribution of
    routing\n   information.  Mechanisms for this are described in [1] and have been\n
    \  successfully used by transit service providers.  However, control\n   over
    the distribution of routing information is presently based on\n   either IP address
    prefixes or on the value of the AS_PATH attribute\n   (or part of it).\n   To
    facilitate and simplify the control of routing information this\n   document suggests
    a grouping of destinations so that the routing\n   decision can also be based
    on the identity of a group.  Such a scheme\n   is expected to significantly simplify
    a BGP speaker's configuration\n   that controls distribution of routing information.\n"
  title: Introduction
- contents:
  - "Terms and Definitions\n   Community\n      A community is a group of destinations
    which share some common\n      property.\n      Each autonomous system administrator
    may define which communities\n      a destination belongs to.  By default, all
    destinations belong to\n      the general Internet community.\n"
  title: Terms and Definitions
- contents:
  - "Examples\n   A property such as \"NSFNET sponsored/AUP\" could be added to all
    AUP\n   compliant destinations advertised into the NSFNET.  NSFNET operators\n
    \  could define a policy that would advertise all routes, tagged or not,\n   to
    directly connected AUP compliant customers and only tagged routes\n   to commercial
    or external sites. This would insure that at least one\n   side of a given connection
    is AUP compliant as a way of enforcing NSF\n   transit policy guidelines.\n   In
    this example, we have just eliminated the primary motivation for a\n   complex
    policy routing database that is used to generate huge prefix\n   and AS path based
    filter rules.  We have also eliminated the delays\n   caused by the out-of-band
    maintenance of this database (mailing in\n   NACRs, weekly configuration runs,
    etc.)\n   A second example comes from experience with aggregation.  It is often\n
    \  useful to advertise both an aggregate prefix and the component more-\n   specific
    prefixes that were used to form the aggregate to optimize\n   \"next hop\" routing.
    \ These component prefixes are only useful to the\n   neighboring BGP peer or
    perhaps the autonomous system of the\n   neighboring BGP peer, so it is desirable
    to filter this information.\n   By specifying a community value that the neighboring
    peer or peers\n   will match and filter on, these more specific routes may be\n
    \  advertised with the assurance that they will not propagate beyond\n   their
    desired scope.\n"

  - "COMMUNITIES attribute\n   This document creates the COMMUNITIES path attribute
    is an optional\n   transitive attribute of variable length.  The attribute consists
    of a\n   set of four octet values, each of which specify a community.  All\n   routes
    with this attribute belong to the communities listed in the\n   attribute.\n   The
    COMMUNITIES attribute has Type Code 8.\n   Communities are treated as 32 bit values,
    \ however for administrative\n   assignment,  the following presumptions may be
    made:\n   The community attribute values ranging from 0x0000000 through\n   0x0000FFFF
    and 0xFFFF0000 through 0xFFFFFFFF are hereby reserved.\n   The rest of the community
    attribute values shall be encoded using an\n   autonomous system number in the
    first two octets.  The semantics of\n   the final two octets may be defined by
    the autonomous system (e.g. AS\n   690 may define research, educational and commercial
    community values\n   that may be used for policy routing as defined by the operators
    of\n   that AS using community attribute values 0x02B20000 through\n   0x02B2FFFF).\n"

    a communities attribute\n         containing this value MUST NOT be advertised
    outside a BGP\n         confederation boundary (a stand-alone autonomous system

  - "Operation\n   A BGP speaker may use this attribute to control which routing\n
    \  information it accepts, prefers or distributes to other neighbors.\n   A BGP
    speaker receiving a route that does not have the COMMUNITIES\n   path attribute
    may append this attribute to the route when\n   propagating it to its peers.\n
    \  A BGP speaker receiving a route with the COMMUNITIES path attribute\n   may
    modify this attribute according to the local policy.\n"

- contents:
  - "Aggregation\n   If a range of routes is to be aggregated and the resultant aggregates\n
    \  attribute section does not carry the ATOMIC_AGGREGATE attribute, then\n   the
    resulting aggregate should have a COMMUNITIES path attribute\n   which contains
    all communities from all of the aggregated routes.\n"

    2 and all\n   subsequent versions of BGP unless specifically noted otherwise.\n"
