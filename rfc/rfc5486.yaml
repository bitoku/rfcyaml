- title: 1.  Introduction

  - "1.  Introduction\n   The term \"Voice over IP Peering\" (VoIP Peering) has historically\
    \ been\n   used to describe a wide variety of practices pertaining to the\n  \
    \ interconnection of service provider networks and to the delivery of\n   Session\
    \ Initiation Protocol (SIP [2]) call termination over those\n   interconnections.\n\
    \   The discussion of these interconnections has at times been confused\n   by\
    \ the fact that the term \"peering\" is used in various contexts to\n   describe\
    \ interconnection at different levels in a protocol stack.\n   Session Peering\
    \ for Multimedia Interconnect focuses on how to\n   identify and route real-time\
    \ sessions (such as VoIP calls) at the\n   session layer, and it does not (necessarily)\
    \ cover the exchange of\n   packet-routing data or media sessions.  In particular,\
    \ \"layer 5\n   network\" is used here to refer to the interconnection between\
    \ SIP\n   servers, as opposed to interconnection at the IP layer (\"layer 3\"\
    ).\n   The term \"peering\" will be used throughout the remainder of the\n   document\
    \ for the purpose of indicating a layer 5 interconnection.\n   This document introduces\
    \ standard terminology for use in\n   characterizing real-time session peering.\
    \  Note however, that while\n   this document is primarily targeted at the VoIP\
    \ peering case, the\n   terminology described here is applicable to those cases\
    \ in which\n   service providers peer using SIP signaling (defined as SIP Service\n\
    \   Providers; see Section 3.9) for non-voice or quasi-real-time\n   communications\
    \ like instant messaging.\n   The remainder of this document is organized as follows:\
    \ Section 2\n   provides the general context for the Session PEERing for Multimedia\n\
    \   INTerconnect working group (SPEERMINT).  Section 3 provides the\n   general\
    \ definitions for real-time, SIP-based communication, with\n   initial focus on\
    \ the VoIP peering case, and Section 4 defines the\n   terminology describing\
    \ the various forms of peering.  Finally,\n   Section 5 introduces the concept\
    \ of federations.\n"
- title: 2.  SPEERMINT Context
  contents:
  - "2.  SPEERMINT Context\n   SPEERMINT provides a peering framework that leverages\
    \ the building\n   blocks of existing IETF-defined protocols such as SIP [2] and\
    \ ENUM\n   [4].  While the SPEERMINT working group describes the use of these\n\
    \   protocols in peering, it does not redefine how these protocols use\n   input\
    \ or output variables necessary for creating Session\n   Establishment Data (SED)\
    \ or the methods in which this data will be\n   used during the peering process.\
    \  See Section 3.3 for additional\n   detail on SED and its principal variables\
    \ such as Uniform Resource\n   Identifiers (URIs) [3] and telephone numbers of\
    \ E.164 numbers [5].\n   For example, while the SPEERMINT working group is not\
    \ limited to the\n   use of telephone numbers, an E.164 number may be used as\
    \ a key in an\n   E.164-to-URI mapping using ENUM.  This mapping involves looking\
    \ up\n   Naming Authority Pointer (NAPTR) records in the DNS, and results in a\n\
    \   SIP URI.  The process for deriving this information has already been\n   defined\
    \ in [4], but is used as a building block for SPEERMINT SED, on\n   which the\
    \ subsequent call routing is based.  Note that the call-\n   routing step does\
    \ not depend on the presence of an E.164 number.\n   Indeed, the URI resulting\
    \ from an ENUM query may no longer even\n   contain numbers of any type.  In particular,\
    \ the SIP URI can be\n   advertised in various other ways, such as on a web page.\n\
    \   Finally, note that the term \"call\" is being used here in the most\n   general\
    \ sense, i.e., call routing and session routing are used\n   interchangeably.\n"

- title: 3.1.  Signaling Path Border Element
  contents:
  - "3.1.  Signaling Path Border Element\n   A signaling path border element (SBE)\
    \ is located on the\n   administrative border of a domain through which inter-domain\
    \ session\n   layer messages will flow.  It typically provides signaling functions\n\
    \   such as protocol inter-working (for example, H.323 to SIP), identity\n   and\
    \ topology hiding, and Session Admission Control for a domain.\n"
- title: 3.2.  Data Path Border Element
  contents:
  - "3.2.  Data Path Border Element\n   A data path border element (DBE) is located\
    \ on the administrative\n   border of a domain through which flows the media associated\
    \ with an\n   inter-domain session.  It typically provides media-related functions\n\
    \   such as deep packet inspection and modification, media relay, and\n   firewall-traversal\
    \ support.  The DBE may be controlled by the SBE.\n"
- title: 3.3.  Session Establishment Data
  contents:
  - "3.3.  Session Establishment Data\n   Session Establishment Data, or SED, is the\
    \ data used to route a call\n   to the next hop associated with the called domain's\
    \ ingress point.  A\n   domain's ingress point might, for example, be the location\
    \ derived\n   from various types of DNS records (NAPTR, SRV, or A record) [1]\
    \ that\n   resulted from the resolution of the SIP URI.\n   More specifically,\
    \ the SED is the set of parameters that the outgoing\n   SBEs need to complete\
    \ the call, and may include:\n      o  A destination SIP URI\n      o  A SIP proxy\
    \ or ingress SBE to send the INVITE to, including:\n         -  Fully Qualified\
    \ Domain Name (FQDN)\n         -  Port\n         -  Transport Protocol (UDP [8],\
    \ TCP [9], and TLS [7])\n      o Security parameters, including:\n         - \
    \ TLS certificate to use\n         -  TLS certificate to expect\n         -  TLS\
    \ certificate verification setting\n      o  Optional resource control parameters\
    \ such as:\n         -  Limits on the total number of call initiations to a peer\n\
    \         -  Limits on SIP transactions per second\n"
- title: 3.4.  Call Routing
  contents:
  - "3.4.  Call Routing\n   Call routing is the set of processes and rules used to\
    \ route a call\n   and any subsequent mid-dialog SIP requests to their proper\
    \ (SIP)\n   destination.  More generally, call routing can be thought of as the\n\
    \   set of processes and rules that are used to route a real-time session\n  \
    \ to its termination point.\n"
- title: 3.5.  PSTN
  contents:
  - "3.5.  PSTN\n   The term \"PSTN\" refers to the Public Switched Telephone Network.\
    \  In\n   particular, the PSTN refers to the collection of interconnected,\n \
    \  circuit-switched, voice-oriented public telephone networks, both\n   commercial\
    \ and government-owned.  In general, PSTN terminals are\n   addressed using E.164\
    \ numbers; however, various dial-plans (such as\n   emergency services dial-plans)\
    \ may not directly use E.164 numbers.\n"
- title: 3.6.  IP Path
  contents:
  - "3.6.  IP Path\n   For the purposes of this document, an IP path is defined to\
    \ be a\n   sequence of zero or more IP router hops.\n"
- title: 3.7.  Peer Network
  contents:
  - "3.7.  Peer Network\n   This document defines a peer network as the set of SIP\
    \ user agents\n   (UAs) (customers) that are associated with a single administrative\n\
    \   domain and can be reached via some IP path.  Note that such a peer\n   network\
    \ may also contain end-users who are located on the PSTN (and\n   hence may also\
    \ be interconnected with the PSTN) as long as they are\n   also reachable via\
    \ some IP path.\n"
- title: 3.8.  Service Provider
  contents:
  - "3.8.  Service Provider\n   A Service Provider (SP) is defined to be an entity\
    \ that provides\n   layer 3 (IP) transport of SIP signaling and media packets.\
    \  Example\n   services may include, but are not limited to, Ethernet Private\
    \ Line\n   (EPL), Frame Relay, and IP Virtual Private Network (VPN).  An example\n\
    \   of this may be an Internet Service Provider (ISP).\n"
- title: 3.9.  SIP Service Provider
  contents:
  - "3.9.  SIP Service Provider\n   A SIP Service Provider (SSP) is an entity that\
    \ provides session\n   services utilizing SIP signaling to its customers.  In\
    \ the event that\n   the SSP is also a function of the SP, it may also provide\
    \ media\n   streams to its customers.  Such an SSP may additionally be peered\n\
    \   with other SSPs.  An SSP may also interconnect with the PSTN.  An SSP\n  \
    \ may also be referred to as an Internet Telephony Service Provider\n   (ITSP).\
    \  While the terms ITSP and SSP are frequently used\n   interchangeably, this\
    \ document and other subsequent SIP peering-\n   related documents should use\
    \ the term SSP.  SSP more accurately\n   depicts the use of SIP as the underlying\
    \ layer 5 signaling protocol.\n"
- title: 4.  Peering
  contents:
  - "4.  Peering\n   While the precise definition of the term \"peering\" is the subject\
    \ of\n   considerable debate, peering in general refers to the negotiation of\n\
    \   reciprocal interconnection arrangements, settlement-free or\n   otherwise,\
    \ between operationally independent service providers.\n   This document distinguishes\
    \ two types of peering, layer 3 peering and\n   layer 5 peering, which are described\
    \ below.\n"
- title: 4.1.  Layer 3 Peering
  contents:
  - "4.1.  Layer 3 Peering\n   Layer 3 peering refers to interconnection of two service\
    \ providers'\n   networks for the purposes of exchanging IP packets that are destined\n\
    \   for one (or both) of the peer's networks.  Layer 3 peering is\n   generally\
    \ agnostic to the IP payload, and is frequently achieved\n   using a routing protocol\
    \ such as the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP)\n   [6] to exchange the required routing\
    \ information.\n   An alternate, perhaps more operational, definition of layer\
    \ 3 peering\n   is that two peers exchange only customer routes, and hence any\n\
    \   traffic between peers terminates on one of the peers' networks or the\n  \
    \ peer's customer's network.\n"
- title: 4.2.  Layer 5 Peering
  contents:
  - "4.2.  Layer 5 Peering\n   Layer 5 (session) peering refers to interconnection\
    \ of two SSPs for\n   the purposes of routing real-time (or quasi-real-time) call\
    \ signaling\n   between their respective customers using SIP methods.  Such peering\n\
    \   may be direct or indirect (see Section 4.2.1 and Section 4.2.2\n   below).\
    \  Note that media streams associated with this signaling (if\n   any) are not\
    \ constrained to follow the same set of IP paths.\n"
- title: 4.2.1.  Direct Peering
  contents:
  - "4.2.1.  Direct Peering\n   Direct peering describes those cases in which two\
    \ SSPs peer without\n   using an intervening layer 5 network.\n"
- title: 4.2.2.  Indirect Peering
  contents:
  - "4.2.2.  Indirect Peering\n   Indirect, or transit, peering refers to the establishment\
    \ of either a\n   signaling and media path or a signaling path alone via one (or\
    \ more)\n   layer 5 transit network(s).  In this case, it is generally required\n\
    \   that a trust relationship is established between the originating SSP\n   and\
    \ the transit SSP on one side, and between the transit SSP and the\n   termination\
    \ SSP on the other side.\n"
- title: 4.2.3.  On-Demand Peering
  contents:
  - "4.2.3.  On-Demand Peering\n   SSPs are said to peer on-demand when they are able\
    \ to exchange SIP\n   traffic without any pre-association prior to the origination\
    \ of a\n   real-time transaction (like a SIP message) between the domains.  Any\n\
    \   information that needs to be exchanged between domains in support of\n   peering\
    \ can be learned through a dynamic protocol mechanism.  On-\n   demand peering\
    \ can occur as direct or indirect.\n"
- title: 4.2.4.  Static Peering
  contents:
  - "4.2.4.  Static Peering\n   SSPs are said to peer statically when pre-association\
    \ between\n   providers is required for the initiation of any real-time\n   transactions\
    \ (like a SIP message).  Static peering can occur as\n   direct or indirect. \
    \ An example of static peering is a federation.\n   Each of the peers within the\
    \ federation must first agree on a common\n   set of rules and guidelines for\
    \ peering, thus pre-associating with\n   each other prior to initiating session\
    \ requests.\n"
- title: 4.3.  Functions
  contents:
  - "4.3.  Functions\n   The following are terms associated with the functions required\
    \ for\n   peering.\n"
- title: 4.3.1.  Signaling Function
  contents:
  - "4.3.1.  Signaling Function\n   The Signaling Function (SF) performs routing of\
    \ SIP requests for\n   establishing and maintaining calls, and to assist in the\
    \ discovery or\n   exchange of parameters to be used by the Media Function (MF).\
    \  The SF\n   is a capability of SIP processing elements such as SIP proxies,\
    \ SBEs,\n   and user agents.\n"
- title: 4.3.2.  Media Function
  contents:
  - "4.3.2.  Media Function\n   The Media Function (MF) performs media-related functions\
    \ such as\n   media transcoding and media security implementation between two\
    \ SSPs.\n   The MF is a capability of SIP-session-associated media end-points\n\
    \   such as DBEs and user agents.\n"
- title: 4.3.3.  Look-Up Function
  contents:
  - "4.3.3.  Look-Up Function\n   The Look-Up Function (LUF) determines for a given\
    \ request the target\n   domain to which the request should be routed.  An example\
    \ of an LUF\n   is an ENUM [4] look-up or a SIP INVITE request to a SIP proxy\n\
    \   providing redirect responses for peers.\n   In some cases, some entity (usually\
    \ a 3rd party or federation)\n   provides peering assistance to the originating\
    \ SSP by providing this\n   function.  The assisting entity may provide information\
    \ relating to\n   direct (Section 4.2.1) or indirect (Section 4.2.2) peering as\n\
    \   necessary.\n"
- title: 4.3.4.  Location Routing Function
  contents:
  - "4.3.4.  Location Routing Function\n   The Location Routing Function (LRF) determines\
    \ for the target domain\n   of a given request the location of the SF in that\
    \ domain, and\n   optionally develops other SED required to route the request\
    \ to that\n   domain.  An example of the LRF may be applied to either example\
    \ in\n   Section 4.3.3.  Once the ENUM response or SIP 302 redirect is\n   received\
    \ with the destination's SIP URI, the LRF must derive the\n   destination peer's\
    \ SF from the FQDN in the domain portion of the URI.\n   In some cases, some entity\
    \ (usually a 3rd party or federation)\n   provides peering assistance to the originating\
    \ SSP by providing this\n   function.  The assisting entity may provide information\
    \ relating to\n   direct (Section 4.2.1) or indirect (Section 4.2.2) peering as\n\
    \   necessary.\n"
- title: 5.  Federations
  contents:
  - "5.  Federations\n   A federation is a group of SSPs that agree to exchange calls\
    \ with\n   each other via SIP and who agree on a set of administrative rules for\n\
    \   such calls (settlement, abuse-handling, etc.) and specific rules for\n   the\
    \ technical details of the peering.\n   The following provides examples of rules\
    \ that the peers of a\n   federation may agree to and enforce upon all participants:\n\
    \      o  Common domain for all federation peers (e.g.,\n         bob@peer1.federation.example.com)\n\
    \      o  Codec rules (e.g., all peers must use the ITU-T G.711 codec\n      \
    \   [10])\n      o  Authentication preference (e.g., all peers must use TLS when\n\
    \         requesting to establish sessions with other peers)\n      o  Transport\
    \ protocol (e.g., all peers must use TCP)\n      o  SIP address resolution mechanisms\
    \ (e.g., all peers must use\n         ENUM for resolving telephone numbers to\
    \ SIP URIs)\n   Finally, note that an SSP can be a member of:\n      -  No federation\
    \ (e.g., the SSP has only bilateral peering\n         agreements)\n      -  A\
    \ single federation\n      -  Multiple federations\n   Also, an SSP can have any\
    \ combination of bilateral and multilateral\n   (i.e., federated) peers.\n"
