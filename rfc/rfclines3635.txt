Abstract This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB) for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
In particular, it defines objects for managing Ethernet like interfaces.
This memo obsoletes RFC 2665.
It updates that specification by including management information useful for the management of 10 Gigabit per second (Gb/s) Ethernet interfaces.
This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB) for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
In particular, it defines objects for managing Ethernet like interfaces.
This memo also includes a MIB module.
This MIB module updates the list of managed objects specified in the earlier version of this MIB, module, RFC 2665 [RFC2665].
Ethernet technology, as defined by the 802.3 Working Group of the IEEE, continues to evolve, with scalable increases in speed, new types of cabling and interfaces, and new features.
This evolution may require changes in the managed objects in order to reflect this new functionality.
This document, as with other documents issued by this working group, reflects a certain stage in the evolution of Ethernet technology.
In the future, this document might be revised, or new documents might be issued by the Ethernet Interfaces and Hub MIB Working Group, in order to reflect the evolution of Ethernet technology.
The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].
The Internet Standard Management Framework
For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current Internet Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of RFC 3410 [RFC3410].
Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed the Management Information Base or MIB.
MIB objects are generally accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the Structure of Management Information (SMI).
This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58, RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58
, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
Overview Instances of these object types represent attributes of an interface to an ethernet like communications medium.
At present, ethernet like media are identified by the value ethernetCsmacd(6) of the ifType object in the Interfaces MIB [RFC2863].
Some older implementations may return the values iso88023Csmacd(7) or starLan(11) for ifType for ethernet like media.
The definitions presented here are based on Section 30, "10 Mb/s, 100 Mb/s 1000 Mb/s and 10 Gb/s Management", and Annex 30A, "GDMO Specification for 802.3 managed object classes" of IEEE Std.
802.3, 2002 Edition [IEEE802.3], amended by IEEE Std.
[IEEE802.3ae], as originally interpreted by Frank Kastenholz, then of Interlan in [KASTEN].
Implementors of these MIB objects should note that IEEE Std.
802.3 [IEEE802.3] explicitly describes (in the form of Pascal pseudocode)
when, where, and how various MAC attributes are measured.
The IEEE document also describes the effects of MAC actions that may be invoked by manipulating instances of the MIB objects defined here.
To the extent that some of the attributes defined in [IEEE802.3] are represented by previously defined objects in MIB 2 [RFC1213] or in the Interfaces MIB [RFC2863], such attributes are not redundantly represented by objects defined in this memo.
Among the attributes represented by objects defined in other memos are the number of octets transmitted or received on a particular interface, the number of frames transmitted or received on a particular interface, the promiscuous status of an interface, the MAC address of an interface, and multicast information associated with an interface.
This section applies only when this MIB is used in conjunction with the "old" [RFC1213] interface group.
The relationship between an ethernet like interface and an interface in the context of MIB 2 is one to one.
As such, the value of an ifIndex object instance can be directly used to identify corresponding instances of the objects defined herein.
For agents which implement the (now deprecated)
ifSpecific object, an instance of that object that is associated with an ethernet like interface has the OBJECT IDENTIFIER value:
Relation to the Interfaces MIB
The Interface MIB [RFC2863] requires that any MIB which is an adjunct of the Interface MIB clarify specific areas within the Interface MIB.
These areas were intentionally left vague in the Interface MIB to avoid over constraining the MIB, thereby precluding management of certain media types.
Section 4 of [RFC2863] enumerates several areas which a media specific MIB must clarify.
Each of these areas is addressed in a following subsection.
The implementor is referred to [RFC2863] in order to understand the general intent of these areas.
Ordinarily, there are no sublayers for an ethernet like interface.
However there may be implementation specific requirements which require the use of sublayers.
One example is the use of 802.3 link aggregation.
In this case, Annex 30C of [IEEE802.3] describes the layering model and the use of the ifStackTable for representing aggregated links.
Another example is the use of the 802.3 WAN Interface Sublayer.
In this case, The 802.3 WIS MIB [RFC3637] describes the layering model and the use of the ifStackTable for representing the WAN sublayer.
This medium does not support virtual circuits and this area is not applicable to this MIB.
This table contains all IEEE
802.3 addresses, unicast, multicast, and broadcast, for which this interface will receive packets and forward them up to a higher layer entity for local consumption.
The format of the address, contained in ifRcvAddressAddress, is the same as for ifPhysAddress.
In the event that the interface is part of a MAC bridge, this table does not include unicast addresses which are accepted for possible forwarding out some other port.
This table is explicitly not intended to provide a bridge address filtering mechanism.
This MIB applies to interfaces which have the ifType value ethernetCsmacd(6).
It is REQUIRED that all ethernet like interfaces use an ifType of ethernetCsmacd(6) regardless of the speed that the interface is running or the link layer encapsulation in use.
Use of the ifType values iso88023Csmacd(7) and starLan(11) are deprecated, however some older implementations may return these values.
Management applications should be prepared to receive these deprecated ifType values from older implementations.
There are three other interface types defined in the IANAifType MIB for Ethernet.
These interface types were registered by individual vendors, not by any IETF working group.
A requirement for compliance with this document is that all ethernet like interfaces MUST return ethernetCsmacd(6) for ifType, and MUST NOT return fastEther(62), fastEtherFX(69), or gigabitEthernet(117).
However, as there are fielded implementations that do return these obsolete ifType values
, management applications SHOULD be prepared to receive them from older implementations.
Information on the particular flavor of Ethernet that an interface is running is available from ifSpeed in the Interfaces MIB, and ifMauType in the 802.3 MAU MIB [RFC3636].
Note that implementation of the 802.3 MAU MIB [RFC3636] is REQUIRED for all ethernet like interfaces.
counters, ifInOctets, ifOutOctets, ifHCInOctets and ifHCOutOctets, MUST include all octets in valid frames sent or received on the interface, including the MAC header and FCS, but not the preamble, start of frame delimiter, or extension octets.
This corresponds to the definition of frameSize/8 in section 4.2.7.1 of [IEEE802.3]
(frameSize is defined in bits rather than octets, and is defined as 2 x addressSize
They do not include the number of octets in collided or failed transmit attempts, since the MAC layer driver typically does not have visibility to count these octets.
They also do not include octets in received invalid frames, since this information is normally not passed to the MAC layer, and since non promiscuous MAC implementations cannot reliably determine whether an invalid frame was actually addressed to this station.
Note that these counters do include octets in valid MAC control frames sent or received on the interface, as well as octets in otherwise valid received MAC frames that are discarded by the MAC layer for some reason (insufficient buffer space, unknown protocol, etc.).
Note that the octet counters in IF MIB do not exactly match the definition of the octet counters in IEEE 802.3.
aOctetsTransmittedOK and aOctetsReceivedOK count only the octets in the clientData and Pad fields, whereas ifInOctets and ifOutOctets include the entire MAC frame, including MAC header and FCS.
However, the IF MIB counters can be derived from the IEEE 802.3 counters as follows
: ifInOctets   aOctetsReceivedOK   (18   aFramesReceivedOK)
Another difference to keep in mind between the IF MIB counters and IEEE 802.3 counters is that in the IEEE 802.3 document, the frame counters and octet counters are always incremented together.
aOctetsTransmittedOK counts the number of octets in frames that were counted by aFramesTransmittedOK.
aOctetsReceivedOK counts the number of octets in frames that were counted by aFramesReceivedOK.
This is not the case with the IF MIB counters.
The IF MIB octet counters count the number of octets sent to or received from the layer below this interface, whereas the packet counters count the number of packets sent to or received from the layer above.
Therefore, received MAC Control frames, ifInDiscards, and ifInUnknownProtos are counted by ifInOctets, but not ifInXcastPkts.
Transmitted MAC Control frames are counted by ifOutOctets, but not ifOutXcastPkts.
ifOutDiscards and ifOutErrors are counted by ifOutXcastPkts, but not ifOutOctets.
The packet counters in the IF MIB do not exactly match the definition of the frame counters in IEEE 802.3.
aFramesTransmittedOK counts the number of frames successfully transmitted on the interface, whereas ifOutUcastPkts, ifOutMulticastPkts and ifOutBroadcastPkts count the number of transmit requests made from a higher layer, whether or not the transmit attempt was successful.
This means that packets counted by ifOutErrors or ifOutDiscards are also counted by ifOutXcastPkts, but are not counted by aFramesTransmittedOK.
This also means that, since MAC Control frames are generated by a sublayer internal to the interface layer rather than by a higher layer, they are not counted by ifOutXcastPkts, but are counted by aFramesTransmittedOK.
Similarly, aFramesReceivedOK counts the number of frames received successfully by the interface, whether or not they are passed to a higher layer, whereas ifInUcastPkts, ifInMulticastPkts and ifInBroadcastPkts count only the number of packets passed to a higher layer.
This means that packets counted by ifInDiscards or ifInUnknownProtos are also counted by aFramesReceivedOK, but are not counted by ifInXcastPkts.
This also means that, since MAC Control frames are consumed by a sublayer internal to the interface layer and not passed to a higher layer, they are not counted by ifInXcastPkts, but are counted by aFramesReceivedOK.
This specification chooses to treat MAC control frames as being originated and consumed within the interface and not counted by the IF MIB packet counters.
MAC control frames are normally sent as multicast packets.
In many network environments, MAC control frames can greatly outnumber multicast frames carrying actual data.
If MAC control frames were included in the ifInMulticastPkts and ifOutMulticastPkts, the count of data carrying multicast packets would tend to be drowned out by the count of MAC control frames, rendering those counters considerably less useful.
To better understand the issues surrounding the mapping of the IF MIB packet and octet counters to an Ethernet interface, it is useful to refer to a Case Diagram [CASE] for the IF MIB counters, with modifications to show the proper interpretation for the Ethernet interface layer.
The defined standard MTU for ethernet like interfaces is 1500 octets.
However, many implementations today support larger packet sizes than the IEEE 802.3 standard.
The value of this object MUST reflect the actual MTU in use on the interface, whether it matches the standard MTU or not.
This value should reflect the value seen by the MAC client interface.
When a higher layer protocol, like IP, is running over Ethernet framing, this is the MTU that will be seen by that higher layer protocol.
However, most ethernet like interfaces today run multiple protocols that use a mix of different framing types.
For example, an IEEE 802.2 LLC type 1 client protocol will see an MTU of 1497 octets on an interface using the IEEE standard maximum packet size, and a protocol running over SNAP will see an MTU of 1492 octets on an interface using the IEEE standard maximum packet size.
However, since specification mandates using the MTU as seen at the MAC client interface, the value of ifMtu would be reported as 1500 octets in these cases.
For ethernet like interfaces operating at 1000 Megabits per second (Mb/s) or less, ifSpeed will represent the current operational speed of the interface in bits per second.
For current interface types, this will be equal to 1,000,000 (1 million), 10,000,000 (10 million), 100,000,000 (100 million), or 1,000,000,000 (1 billion).
ifHighSpeed will represent the current operational speed in millions of bits per second.
For current ethernet like interfaces, this will be equal to 1, 10, 100, or 1,000.
If the interface implements auto negotiation, auto negotiation is enabled for this interface, and the interface has not yet negotiated to an operational speed, these objects SHOULD reflect the maximum speed supported by the interface.
For ethernet like interfaces operating at greater than 1000 Mb/s, ifHighSpeed will represent the current operational speed of the interface in millions of bits per second.
Note that for WAN implementations, this will be the payload data rate over the WAN interface sublayer.
For current implementations, this will be equal to 10,000 for LAN implementations of 10 Gb/s, and 9,294 for WAN implementations of the 10 Gb/s MAC over an OC 192 PHY.
For these speeds, ifSpeed should report a maximum unsigned 32 bit value of 4,294,967,295 as specified in [RFC2863].
Note that these object MUST NOT indicate a doubled value when operating in full duplex mode.
It MUST indicate the correct line speed regardless of the current duplex mode.
The duplex mode of the interface may be determined by examining either the dot3StatsDuplexStatus object in this MIB module, or the ifMauType object in the 802.3 MAU MIB [RFC3636].
This object contains the IEEE 802.3 address which is placed in the source address field of any Ethernet, Starlan, or IEEE 802.3 frames that originate at this interface.
Usually this will be kept in ROM on the interface hardware.
Some systems may set this address via software.
In a system where there are several such addresses the designer has a tougher choice.
The address chosen should be the one most likely to be of use to network management
(e.g.  the address placed in ARP responses for systems which are primarily IP systems).
If the designer truly can not chose, use of the factory provided ROM address is suggested.
If the address can not be determined, an octet string of zero length should be returned.
The address is stored in binary in this object.
The address is stored in "canonical" bit order, that is, the Group Bit is positioned as the low order bit of the first octet.
Thus, the first byte of a multicast address would have the bit 0x01 set.
The following table provides specific implementation guidelines for applying the interface group objects to ethernet like media.
Each ethernet like interface is represented by an ifEntry.
The dot3StatsTable in this MIB module is indexed by dot3StatsIndex.
The interface identified by a particular value of dot3StatsIndex is the same interface as identified by the same value of ifIndex.
Support for 'testing' is not required.
The operational state of the interface.
Support for 'testing' is not required.
The value 'dormant' has no meaning for an ethernet like interface.
The number of octets in valid MAC frames received on this interface, including the MAC header and FCS.
This does include the number of octets in valid MAC Control frames received on this interface.
Note that this does not include MAC Control frames, since MAC Control frames are consumed by the interface layer and are not passed to any higher layer protocol.
The sum for this interface of dot3StatsAlignmentErrors, dot3StatsFCSErrors, dot3StatsFrameTooLongs, and
The number of octets transmitted in valid MAC frames on this interface, including the MAC header and FCS.
This does include the number of octets in valid MAC Control frames transmitted on this interface.
Note that this does not include MAC Control frames, since MAC Control frames are generated by the interface layer, and are not passed from any higher layer protocol.
The sum for this interface of: dot3StatsSQETestErrors, dot3StatsLateCollisions, dot3StatsExcessiveCollisions, dot3StatsInternalMacTransmitErrors and dot3StatsCarrierSenseErrors.
Note that this does not include MAC Control frames, since MAC Control frames are consumed by the interface layer and are not passed to any higher layer protocol.
Note that this does not include MAC Control frames, since MAC Control frames are consumed by the interface layer, and are not passed to any higher layer protocol.

that are capable of operating at ifHCOutUcastPkts
This will normally be 'true'.
It will be 'false' in the case where this interface uses the WAN Interface Sublayer.
Note that a discontinuity in the Interface MIB counters may also indicate a discontinuity in some or all of the counters in this MIB that are associated with that interface.
Relation to the 802.3 MAU MIB Support for the mauModIfCompl3 compliance statement of the MAU MIB [RFC3636] is REQUIRED for Ethernet like interfaces.
This MIB is needed in order to allow applications to determine the current MAU type in use by the interface, and to control autonegotiation and duplex mode for the interface.
Implementing this MIB module without implementing the MAU MIB would leave applications with no standard way to determine the media type in use, and no standard way to control the duplex mode of the interface.
dot3StatsEtherChipSet This document defines an object called dot3StatsEtherChipSet, which is used to identify the MAC hardware used to communicate on an interface.
Previous versions of this document contained a number of OID assignments for some existing Ethernet chipsets.
Maintaining that list as part of this document has proven to be problematic, so the OID assignments contained in previous versions of this document have now been moved to a separate document [RFC2666].
The dot3StatsEtherChipSet object has now been deprecated.
Implementation feedback indicates that this object is much more useful in theory than in practice.
The object's utility in debugging network problems in the field appears to be limited.
In those cases where it may be useful, it is not sufficient, since it identifies only the MAC chip, and not the PHY, PMD, or driver.
The administrative overhead involved in maintaining a central registry of chipset OIDs cannot be justified for an object whose usefulness is questionable at best.
Implementations which continue to support this object for the purpose of backwards compatibility may continue to use the values defined in [RFC2666].
For chipsets not listed in [RFC2666], implementors that wish to support this object and return a valid OBJECT IDENTIFIER value may assign OBJECT IDENTIFIERS within that part of the registration tree delegated to individual enterprises.

A count of frames received on a particular interface that are not an integral number of octets in length and do not pass the FCS check.
The count represented by an instance of this object is incremented when the alignmentError status is returned by the MAC service to the LLC (or other MAC user).
Received frames for which multiple error conditions pertain are, according to the conventions of IEEE 802.3 Layer Management, counted exclusively according to the error status presented to the LLC.
This counter does not increment for group encoding schemes greater than 4 bits per group.
For interfaces operating at 10 Gb/s, this counter can roll over in less than 5 minutes if it is incrementing at its maximum rate.
Since that amount of time could be less than a management station's poll cycle time, in order to avoid a loss of information, a management station is advised to poll the dot3HCStatsAlignmentErrors object for 10 Gb/s or faster interfaces.
Discontinuities in the value of this counter can occur at re initialization of the management system, and at other times as indicated by the value of ifCounterDiscontinuityTime.

Coding errors detected by the physical layer for speeds above 10 Mb/s will cause the frame to fail the FCS check.
For interfaces operating at 10 Gb/s, this counter can roll over in less than 5 minutes if it is incrementing at its maximum rate.

A frame is only counted by an instance of this object if it is not counted by the corresponding instance of either the dot3StatsLateCollisions object, the dot3StatsExcessiveCollisions object, or the dot3StatsCarrierSenseErrors object.
The precise meaning of the count represented by an instance of this object
In particular, an instance of this object may represent a count of transmission errors on a particular interface that are not otherwise counted.
For interfaces operating at 10 Gb/s, this counter can roll over in less than 5 minutes if it is incrementing at its maximum rate.
Since that amount of time could be less than a management station's poll cycle time, in order to avoid a loss of information, a management station is advised to poll the dot3HCStatsInternalMacTransmitErrors object for 10 Gb/s or faster interfaces.

The count represented by an instance of this object is incremented at most once per transmission attempt, even if the carrier sense condition fluctuates during a transmission attempt.
This counter does not increment when the interface is operating in full duplex mode.
Discontinuities in the value of this counter can occur at re initialization of the management system, and at other times as indicated by the value of ifCounterDiscontinuityTime.
A count of frames received on a particular interface that exceed the maximum permitted frame size.
The count represented by an instance of this object is incremented when the frameTooLong status is returned by the MAC service to the LLC (or other MAC user).
Received frames for which multiple error conditions pertain are, according to the conventions of IEEE 802.3 Layer Management, counted exclusively according to the error status presented to the LLC.
For interfaces operating at 10 Gb/s, this counter can roll over in less than 80 minutes if it is incrementing at its maximum rate.
Since that amount of time could be less than a management station's poll cycle time, in order to avoid a loss of information, a management station is advised to poll the dot3HCStatsFrameTooLongs object for 10 Gb/s or faster interfaces.
Discontinuities in the value of this counter can occur at re initialization of the management system, and at other times as indicated by the value of ifCounterDiscontinuityTime.
A count of frames for which reception on a particular interface fails due to an internal MAC sublayer receive error.
A frame is only counted by an instance of this object if it is not counted by the corresponding instance of either the dot3StatsFrameTooLongs object, the dot3StatsAlignmentErrors object, or the dot3StatsFCSErrors object.
The precise meaning of the count represented by an instance of this object
In particular, an instance of this object may represent a count of receive errors on a particular interface that are not otherwise counted.
For interfaces operating at 10 Gb/s, this counter can roll over in less than 5 minutes if it is incrementing at its maximum rate.
Since that amount of time could be less than a management station's poll cycle time, in order to avoid a loss of information, a management station is advised to poll the dot3HCStatsInternalMacReceiveErrors object for 10 Gb/s or faster interfaces.
Discontinuities in the value of this counter can occur at re initialization of the management system, and at other times as indicated by the value of ifCounterDiscontinuityTime.
This object contains an OBJECT IDENTIFIER which identifies the chipset used to realize the interface.
Ethernet like interfaces are typically built out of several different chips.
The MIB implementor is presented with a decision of which chip to identify via this object.
The implementor should identify the chip which is usually called the Medium Access Control chip.
If no such chip is easily identifiable, the implementor should identify the chip which actually gathers the transmit and receive statistics and error indications.
This would allow a manager station to correlate the statistics and the chip generating them, giving it the ability to take into account any known anomalies in the chip.
This object has been deprecated.

For an interface operating in half duplex mode at 1000 Mb/s, the number of times the receiving media is non idle (a carrier event) for a period of time equal to or greater than slotTime, and during which there was at least one occurrence of an event that causes the PHY to indicate 'Data reception error' or
'carrier extend error' on the GMII.
For an interface operating in full duplex mode at 1000 Mb/s, the number of times the receiving media is non idle (a carrier event) for a period of time equal to or greater than minFrameSize, and during which there was at least one occurrence of an event that causes the PHY to indicate 'Data reception error' on the GMII.
For an interface operating at 10 Gb/s, the number of times the receiving media is non idle (a carrier event) for a period of time equal to or greater than minFrameSize, and during which there was at least one occurrence of an event that causes the PHY to indicate 'Receive Error' on the XGMII.
The count represented by an instance of this object is incremented at most once per carrier event, even if multiple symbol errors occur during the carrier event.
This count does not increment if a collision is present.
This counter does not increment when the interface is operating at 10 Mb/s.
For interfaces operating at 10 Gb/s, this counter can roll over in less than 5 minutes if it is incrementing at its maximum rate.
Since that amount of time could be less than a management station's poll cycle time, in order to avoid a loss of information, a management station is advised to poll the dot3HCStatsSymbolErrors object for 10 Gb/s or faster interfaces.
Discontinuities in the value of this counter can occur at re initialization of the management system, and at other times as indicated by the value of ifCounterDiscontinuityTime.
'unknown' indicates that the current duplex mode could not be determined.
Management control of the duplex mode is accomplished through the MAU MIB.
When an interface does not support autonegotiation, or when autonegotiation is not enabled, the duplex mode is controlled using ifMauDefaultType.
When autonegotiation is supported and enabled, duplex mode is controlled using ifMauAutoNegAdvertisedBits.
In either case, the currently operating duplex mode is reflected both in this object and in ifMauType.
Note that this object provides redundant information with ifMauType.
Normally, redundant objects are discouraged.
However, in this instance, it allows a management application to determine the duplex status of an interface without having to know every possible value of ifMauType.
This was felt to be sufficiently valuable to justify the redundancy."

The Time Domain Reflectometry (TDR) test is specific to ethernet like interfaces of type 10Base5 and 10Base2.
The TDR value may be useful in determining the approximate distance to a cable fault.
It is advisable to repeat this test to check for a consistent resulting TDR value, to verify that there is a fault.
A TDR test returns as its result the time interval, measured in 10 MHz ticks or 100 nsec units, between the start of TDR test transmission and the subsequent detection of a collision or deassertion of carrier.
On successful completion of a TDR test, the result is stored as the value of an appropriate instance of an appropriate vendor specific MIB object, and the OBJECT IDENTIFIER of that instance is stored in the appropriate instance of the appropriate test result code object (thereby indicating where the result has been stored).
This object identity has been deprecated, since the ifTestTable in the IF MIB was deprecated, and there is no longer a standard mechanism for initiating an interface test.

There is one management object defined in this MIB that has a MAX  ACCESS clause of read write.
That object, dot3PauseAdminMode, may be used to change the flow control configuration on a network interface, which may result in dropped packets, or sending flow control packets on links where the link partner will not understand them.
Either action could be detrimental to network performance.
Such objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.
The support for SET operations in a non secure environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on network operations.
Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a MAX ACCESS other than not accessible) may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.
In particular, the dot3StatsEtherChipSet object may be considered sensitive in many environments, since it would allow an intruder to obtain information about which vendor's equipment is in use on the network.
Note that this object has been deprecated.
However, some implementors may still choose to implement it for backwards compatability.
Most of the objects in this MIB module contain statistical information about particular network links.
In some network environments, this information may be considered sensitive.
It is thus important to control even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over the network via SNMP.
SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec), even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is allowed to access and
the objects in this MIB module.
It is recommended that the implementors consider the security features as provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8), including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for authentication and privacy).
Furthermore, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT RECOMMENDED.
Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to enable cryptographic security.
It is then a customer/operator responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate rights to indeed GET or SET
