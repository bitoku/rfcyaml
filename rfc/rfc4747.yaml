    \   Management Protocol (SNMP).\n   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms\
    \ defined in the\n   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies\
    \ a MIB\n   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,\n\
    \   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580\n   [RFC2580].\n"
- title: 3.  Short Overview of Fibre Channel
  contents:
  - "3.  Short Overview of Fibre Channel\n   The Fibre Channel (FC) is logically a\
    \ bidirectional point-to-point\n   serial data channel, structured for high performance.\
    \  Fibre Channel\n   provides a general transport vehicle for higher-level protocols\
    \ such\n   as Small Computer System Interface (SCSI) command sets, the High-\n\
    \   Performance Parallel Interface (HIPPI) data framing, IP (Internet\n   Protocol),\
    \ IEEE 802.2, and others.\n   Physically, Fibre Channel is an interconnection\
    \ of multiple\n   communication points, called N_Ports, interconnected either\
    \ by a\n   switching network, called a Fabric, or by a point-to-point link.  A\n\
    \   Fibre Channel \"node\" consists of one or more N_Ports.  A Fabric may\n  \
    \ consist of multiple Interconnect Elements, some of which are\n   switches. \
    \ An N_Port connects to the Fabric via a port on a switch\n   called an F_Port.\
    \  When multiple FC nodes are connected to a single\n   port on a switch via an\
    \ \"Arbitrated Loop\" topology, the switch port\n   is called an FL_Port, and\
    \ the nodes' ports are called NL_Ports.  The\n   term Nx_Port is used to refer\
    \ to either an N_Port or an NL_Port.  The\n   term Fx_Port is used to refer to\
    \ either an F_Port or an FL_Port.  A\n   switch port, which is interconnected\
    \ to another switch port via an\n   Inter-Switch Link (ISL), is called an E_Port.\
    \  A B_Port connects a\n   bridge device with an E_Port on a switch; a B_Port\
    \ provides a subset\n   of E_Port functionality.\n   Many Fibre Channel components\
    \ (including the Fabric, each node, and\n   most ports) have globally-unique names.\
    \  These globally-unique names\n   are typically formatted as World Wide Names\
    \ (WWNs).  More information\n   on WWNs can be found in [FC-FS].  WWNs are expected\
    \ to be persistent\n   across agent and unit resets.\n   Fibre Channel frames\
    \ contain 24-bit address identifiers that identify\n   the frame's source and\
    \ destination ports.  Each FC port has both an\n   address identifier and a WWN.\
    \  When a Fabric is in use, the FC\n   address identifiers are dynamic and are\
    \ assigned by a switch.  Each\n   octet of a 24-bit address represents a level\
    \ in an address hierarchy,\n   with a Domain_ID being the highest level of the\
    \ hierarchy.\n   Virtual Fabrics allow a single physical Fabric to be divided\
    \ into\n   multiple logical Fabrics.  Each Virtual Fabric may be managed\n   independently\
    \ like traditional Fabrics.  Virtual Fabrics are designed\n   to achieve a better\
    \ utilization of a physical infrastructure and to\n   isolate events in one Virtual\
    \ Fabric from affecting other Fabrics.\n   When one Core Switch provides switching\
    \ functions for multiple\n   Virtual Fabrics, that Core Switch is modeled as containing\
    \ multiple\n   Virtual Switches, one for each Virtual Fabric.\n   Each Virtual\
    \ Fabric is identified by a 12-bit Virtual Fabric ID\n   (VF_ID).  When frames\
    \ from multiple Virtual Fabrics are transmitted\n   over a physical link, the\
    \ VF_ID carried in a frame's Virtual Fabric\n   Tagging Header (VFT_Header) identifies\
    \ which Virtual Fabric the frame\n   belongs to.  The use of VFT_Headers is enabled\
    \ through an initial\n   negotiation exchange between the two connected ports.\n"
- title: 4.  Relationship to Other MIBs
  contents:
  - "4.  Relationship to Other MIBs\n   This MIB extends beyond [RFC4044] to cover\
    \ the functionality, in\n   Fibre Channel switches, of providing Fibre Channel's\
    \ Virtual Fabrics\n   function.\n"
- title: 5.  MIB Overview
  contents:
  - "5.  MIB Overview\n   This MIB module provides the means for monitoring the operation\
    \ of,\n   and configuring some parameters of, one or more instances of Fibre\n\
    \   Channel Virtual Fabric functionality.  (Note that there are no\n   definitions\
    \ in this MIB module of \"managed actions\" which can be\n   invoked via a remote\
    \ network management protocol such as SNMP.)\n   The following MIB module has\
    \ IMPORTS from [RFC2578], [RFC2579],\n   [RFC2580], [RFC2863], [RFC4044], and\
    \ [RFC4439].  In REFERENCE\n   clauses, it refers to [FC-SW-4].\n"
- title: 5.1.  Fibre Channel Management Instance
  contents:
  - "5.1.  Fibre Channel Management Instance\n   A Fibre Channel management instance\
    \ is defined in [RFC4044] as a\n   separable managed instance of Fibre Channel\
    \ functionality.  Fibre\n   Channel functionality may be grouped into Fibre Channel\
    \ management\n   instances in whatever way is most convenient for the\n   implementation(s).\
    \  For example, one such grouping accommodates a\n   single SNMP agent having\
    \ multiple AgentX [RFC2741] sub-agents, with\n   each sub-agent implementing a\
    \ different Fibre Channel management\n   instance.\n   The object, fcmInstanceIndex,\
    \ is IMPORTed from the FC-MGMT-MIB\n   [RFC4044] as the index value to uniquely\
    \ identify each Fibre Channel\n   management instance, for example within the\
    \ same SNMP context\n   ([RFC3411] section 3.3.1).  The t11vfVirtualSwitchTable\
    \ augments the\n   fcmSwitchTable, and the primary index variable of the fcmSwitchTable\n\
    \   is fcmInstanceIndex.\n"
- title: 5.2.  Representing Core and Virtual Switches
  contents:
  - "5.2.  Representing Core and Virtual Switches\n   In the presence of Virtual Switches,\
    \ fcmSwitchTable in RFC4044\n   contains a row for each Virtual Switch. fcmSwitchTable,\n\
    \   t11vfCoreSwitchTable, and t11vfVirtualSwitchTable are complementary.\n   The\
    \ t11vfCoreSwitchTable and t11vfVirtualSwitchTable contain\n   information that\
    \ helps the management client determine which Switches\n   are Virtual Switches\
    \ and how each relates to a Core Switch.  A\n   Virtual Switch must reside in\
    \ a single Core Switch, and a Core Switch\n   is defined as a set of entities\
    \ with the same Core Switch_Name.\n   RFC 4044 was defined before Virtual Switches\
    \ were standard and\n   represented only physical Switches, so the RFC 4044 tables\
    \ were not\n   defined as read-create.  With the advent of Virtual Switches, Virtual\n\
    \   Switches can now be created by administrators, and read-create tables\n  \
    \ are required.  The StorageType of RFC 4044 tables were not defined,\n   and\
    \ StorageTypes used in this MIB should also apply to the RFC 4044\n   tables that\
    \ this MIB augments.\n"

  contents:
  - "7.  Security Considerations\n   There are a number of management objects defined\
    \ in this MIB module\n   with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.\
    \  Such\n   objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network\n\
    \   environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure\n   environment\
    \ without proper protection can have a negative effect on\n   network operations.\
    \  These are the tables and objects and their\n   sensitivity/vulnerability:\n\
    \   t11vfCoreSwitchMaxSupported, t11vfVirtualSwitchVfId,\n   t11vfCoreSwitchStorageType,\
    \ t11vfVirtualSwitchStorageType and\n   t11vfVirtualSwitchRowStatus\n        -\
    \ the ability to change the configuration of Virtual Fabrics on\n          a particular\
    \ switch.\n   t11vfPortTaggingAdminStatus, t11vfLocallyEnabledRowStatus,\n   t11vfPortVfId,\
    \ t11vfPortStorageType and\n   t11vfLocallyEnabledStorageType\n        - the ability\
    \ to change the configuration of Virtual Fabrics on\n          a port of a particular\
    \ switch.\n   Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with\
    \ a\n   MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered sensitive or\n\
    \   vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus important to\n   control\
    \ even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly\n   to even encrypt\
    \ the values of these objects when sending them over\n   the network via SNMP.\
    \  These are the tables and objects and their\n   sensitivity/vulnerability:\n\
    \   t11vfVirtualSwitchCoreSwitchName, t11vfPortTaggingOperStatus,\n   t11vfLocallyEnabledOperStatus,\n\
    \        - the ability to discover configuration of Virtual Fabrics on a\n   \
    \       virtual switch or a port.\n   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include\
    \ adequate security.\n   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by\
    \ using IPSec),\n   even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network\
    \ is\n   allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects\n\
    \   in this MIB module.\n   It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security\
    \ features as\n   provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8),\n\
    \   including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for\n   authentication\
    \ and privacy).\n   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT\n\
    \   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to\n   enable\
    \ cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator\n   responsibility to\
    \ ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an\n   instance of this MIB module\
    \ is properly configured to give access to\n   the objects only to those principals\
    \ (users) that have legitimate\n   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete)\
    \ them.\n"
