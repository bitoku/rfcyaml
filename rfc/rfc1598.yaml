  title: Applicability
- contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   CCITT recommendation X.25 [2] describes a network layer
    protocol\n   providing error-free, sequenced, flow controlled, virtual circuits.\n
    \  X.25 includes a data link layer, X.25 LAPB, which uses ISO 3309, 4335\n   and
    6256.\n   PPP also uses ISO 3309 HDLC as a basis for its framing [3].\n   When
    X.25 is configured as a point-to-point circuit, PPP can use X.25\n   as a framing
    mechanism, ignoring its other features.  This is\n   equivalent to the technique
    used to carry SNAP headers over X.25 [4].\n   At one time, it had been hoped that
    PPP HDLC frames and X.25 frames\n   would co-exist on the same links.  Equipment
    could gradually be\n   converted to PPP.  Subsequently, it has been learned that
    some\n   switches actually remove the X.25 header, transport packets to\n   another
    switch using a different protocol such as Frame Relay, and\n   reconstruct the
    X.25 header at the final hop.  Co-existance and\n   gradual migration are precluded.\n"

  - "2.  Physical Layer Requirements\n   PPP treats X.25 framing as a bit synchronous
    link.  The link MUST be\n   full-duplex, but MAY be either dedicated (permanent)
    or switched.\n   Interface Format\n      PPP presents an octet interface to the
    physical layer.  There is\n      no provision for sub-octets to be supplied or
    accepted.\n   Transmission Rate\n      PPP does not impose any restrictions regarding
    transmission rate,\n      other than that of the particular X.25 interface.\n
    \  Control Signals\n      Implementation of X.25 requires the provision of control
    signals,\n      which indicate when the link has become connected or disconnected.\n
    \     These in turn provide the Up and Down events to the LCP state\n      machine.\n
    \     Because PPP does not normally require the use of control signals,\n      the
    failure of such signals MUST NOT affect correct operation of\n      PPP.  Implications
    are discussed in [2].\n   Encoding\n      The definition of various encodings
    is the responsibility of the\n      DTE/DCE equipment in use, and is outside the
    scope of this\n      specification.\n      While PPP will operate without regard
    to the underlying\n      representation of the bit stream, X.25 requires NRZ encoding.\n"

  - "3.  The Data Link Layer\n   This specification uses the principles, terminology,
    and frame\n   structure described in \"Multiprotocol Interconnect on X.25 and
    ISDN\n   in the Packet Mode\" [4].\n   The purpose of this specification is not
    to document what is already\n   standardized in [4].  Instead, this document attempts
    to give a\n   concise summary and point out specific options and features used
    by\n   PPP.\n"
  title: 3.  The Data Link Layer
- contents:
  - "3.1.  Frame Format\n   Since both \"PPP in HDLC Framing\" [3] and X.25 use ISO
    3309 as a basis\n   for framing, the X.25 header is easily substituted for the
    smaller\n   HDLC header.  The fields are transmitted from left to right.\n    0

  title: 3.1.  Frame Format
- contents:
  - "3.2.  Modification of the Basic Frame\n   The Link Control Protocol can negotiate
    modifications to the basic\n   frame structure.  However, modified frames will
    always be clearly\n   distinguishable from standard frames.\n   Address-and-Control-Field-Compression\n
    \     Because the Address and Control field values are not constant, and\n      are
    modified as the frame is transported by the network switching\n      fabric, Address-and-Control-Field-Compression
    MUST NOT be\n      negotiated.\n   Protocol-Field-Compression\n      Note that
    unlike the HDLC framing, the X.25 framing does not align\n      the Information
    field on a 32-bit boundary.  Alignment to a 16-bit\n      boundary occurs when
    the Protocol field is compressed to a single\n      octet.  When this improves
    throughput, Protocol-Field-Compression\n      SHOULD be negotiated.\n"
  title: 3.2.  Modification of the Basic Frame
- contents:
  - "4.  Call Setup\n   When the link is configured as a Permanent Virtual Circuit
    (PVC),\n   support for Switched Virtual Circuit (SVC) call setup and clearing
    is\n   not required.  Calls are Established and Terminated using PPP LCP\n   packets.\n
    \  When the link is configured as a Switched Virtual Circuit (SVC), the\n   first
    octet in the Call User Data (CUD) Field (the first data octet\n   in the Call
    Request packet) is used for protocol demultiplexing, in\n   accordance with the
    Subsequent Protocol Identifier (SPI) in ISO/IEC\n   TR 9577 [5].  This field contains
    a one octet Network Layer Protocol\n   Identifier (NLPID), which identifies the
    encapsulation in use over\n   the X.25 virtual circuit.  The CUD field MAY contain
    more than one\n   octet of information.\n   The PPP encapsulation MUST be indicated
    by the PPP NLPID value (CF\n   hex).  Any subsequent octet in this CUD is extraneous
    and MUST be\n   ignored.\n   Multipoint networks (or multicast groups) MUST refuse
    calls which\n   indicate the PPP NLPID in the CUD.\n   The accidental connection
    of a link to feed a multipoint network (or\n   multicast group) SHOULD result
    in a misconfiguration indication.\n   This can be detected by multiple responses
    to the LCP Configure-\n   Request with the same Identifier, coming from different
    framing\n   addresses.  Some implementations might be physically unable to either\n
    \  log or report such information.\n   Conformance with this specification requires
    that the PPP NLPID (CF)\n   be supported.  In addition, conformance with [4] requires
    that the IP\n   NLPID (CC) be supported, and does not require that other NLPID
    values\n   be supported, such as Zero (00), SNAP (80), CLNP (81) or ES-IS (82).\n
    \  When IP address negotiation and/or VJ header compression are desired,\n   the
    PPP call setup SHOULD be attempted first.  If the PPP call setup\n   fails, the
    normal IP call setup MUST be used.\n   The PPP NLPID value SHOULD NOT be used
    to demultiplex circuits which\n   use the Zero NLPID in call setup, as described
    in [4].  When such a\n   circuit exists concurrently with PPP encapsulated circuits,
    only\n   network layer traffic which has not been negotiated by the associated\n
    \  NCP is sent over the Zero NLPID circuit.\n   Rationale:\n      Using call setup
    to determine if PPP is supported should be\n      inexpensive, when users aren't
    charged for failed calls.\n      Using the Zero NLPID call together with PPP could
    be expensive,\n      when users are charged per packet or for connect time, due
    to the\n      probing of PPP configuration packets at each call.\n      PPP configuration
    provides a direct indication of the availability\n      of service, and on that
    basis is preferred over the Zero NLPID\n      technique, which can result in \"black-holes\".\n"

  - "5.  Configuration Details\n   The following Configuration Options are recommended:\n
    \     Magic Number\n      Protocol Field Compression\n   The standard LCP configuration
    defaults apply to X.25 links, except\n   MRU.\n   To ensure interoperability with
    existing X.25 implementations, the\n   initial Maximum-Receive-Unit (MRU) is 1600
    octets [4].  This only\n   affects the minimum required buffer space available
    for receiving\n   packets, not the size of packets sent.\n   The typical network
    feeding the link is likely to have a MRU of\n   either 1500, or 2048 or greater.
    \ To avoid fragmentation, the\n   Maximum-Transmission-Unit (MTU) at the network
    layer SHOULD NOT\n   exceed 1500, unless a peer MRU of 2048 or greater is specifically\n
    \  negotiated.\n   The X.25 packet size is not directly related to the MRU.  Instead,\n
    \  Protocol Data Units (PDUs) are sent as X.25 \"complete packet\n   sequences\".
    \ That is, PDUs begin on X.25 data packet boundaries and\n   the M bit (\"more
    data\") is used to fragment PDUs that are larger than\n   one X.25 data packet
    in length.\n"

  - "Security Considerations\n   Implementations MUST NOT consider PPP authentication
    on call setup\n   for one circuit between two systems to apply to concurrent call
    setup\n   for other circuits between those same two systems.  This results in\n
    \  possible security lapses due to over-reliance on the integrity and\n   security
    of switching systems and administrations.  An insertion\n   attack might be undetected.
    \ An attacker which is able to spoof the\n   same calling identity might be able
    to avoid link authentication.\n"
