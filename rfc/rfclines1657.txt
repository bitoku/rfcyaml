This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB) for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
In particular, it describes managed objects used for managing the Border Gateway Protocol Version 4 or lower [1, 2].
The SNMPv2 Network Management Framework The SNMPv2
Network Management Framework consists of four major components.
They are: RFC 1442 which defines the SMI, the mechanisms used for describing and naming objects for the purpose of management.
STD 17, RFC 1213 defines MIB II, the core set of managed objects
forthe Internet suite of protocols.
RFC 1445 which defines the administrative and other architectural aspects of the framework.
RFC 1448 which defines the protocol used for network access to managed objects.
The Framework permits new objects to be defined for the purpose of experimentation and evaluation.
Object Definitions Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed the Management Information Base or MIB.
Objects in the MIB are defined using the subset of Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1) defined in the SMI.
In particular, each object type is named by an OBJECT IDENTIFIER, an administratively assigned name.
The object type together with an object instance serves to uniquely identify a specific instantiation of the object.
For human convenience, we often use a textual string, termed the descriptor, to refer to the object type.
These objects are used to control and manage a BGP 4 implementation.
Apart from a few system wide scalar objects, this MIB is broken into three tables:
the BGP Peer Table, the BGP Received Path Attribute Table, and the BGP 4 Received Path Attribute Table.
The BGP Peer Table contains information about state and current activity of connections with the BGP peers.
The Received Path Attribute Table contains path attributes received from all peers running BGP version 3 or less.
The BGP 4 Received Path Attribute Table contains path attributes received from all BGP 4 peers.
The actual attributes used in determining a route are a subset of the received attribute tables after local routing policy has been applied.

jychu@watson.ibm.com" DESCRIPTION "The MIB module for BGP 4."
Each peer negotiates the version from this vector.
Versions are identified via the string of bits contained within this object.
The first octet contains bits 0 to 7, the second octet contains bits 8 to 15, and so on, with the most significant bit referring to the lowest bit number in the octet (e.g., the MSB of the first octet refers to bit 0).
If a bit, i, is present and set, then the version (i 1) of the BGP is supported."
This table contains, one entry per   BGP peer, information about the BGP peer.
This table contains, one entry per BGP peer, information about the connections with BGP peers."

} MAX ACCESS read write
The desired state of the BGP connection.
A transition from 'stop' to 'start' will cause the BGP Start Event to be generated.
A transition from 'start' to 'stop' will cause the BGP Stop Event to be generated.
This parameter can be used to restart BGP peer connections.
Care should be used in providing write access to this object without adequate authentication."
The local IP address of this entry's BGP connection."
The local port for the TCP connection between the BGP peers."
The remote IP address of this entry's BGP peer."
The remote port for the TCP connection between the BGP peers.
Note that the objects bgpPeerLocalAddr, bgpPeerLocalPort, bgpPeerRemoteAddr and bgpPeerRemotePort provide the appropriate reference to the standard MIB TCP connection table."
"The number of BGP UPDATE messages received on this connection.
This object should be initialized to zero (0) when the connection is established."
"The number of BGP UPDATE messages transmitted on this connection.
This object should be initialized to zero (0) when the connection is established."
"The total number of messages received from the remote peer on this connection.
This object should be initialized to zero when the connection is established."
"The total number of messages transmitted to the remote peer on this connection.
This object should be initialized to zero when the connection is established."
"The last error code and subcode seen by this peer on this connection.
If no error has occurred, this field is zero.
Otherwise, the first byte of this two byte OCTET STRING contains the error code, and the second byte contains the subcode."
"The total number of times the BGP FSM transitioned into the established state."
{ bgpPeerEntry 15 } bgpPeerFsmEstablishedTime OBJECT
"This timer indicates how long (in seconds) this peer has been in the Established state or how long since this peer was last in the Established state.
It is set to zero when a new peer is configured or the router is booted."
"Time interval in seconds for the ConnectRetry timer.
The suggested value for this timer is 120 seconds."
The value of this object is calculated by this BGP speaker by using the smaller of the value in bgpPeerHoldTimeConfigured and the Hold Time received in the OPEN message.
This value must be at lease three seconds if it is not zero (0) in which case the Hold Timer has not been established with the peer, or, the value of bgpPeerHoldTimeConfigured is zero (0)."
The value of this object is calculated by this BGP speaker such that, when compared with bgpPeerHoldTime, it has the same proportion as what bgpPeerKeepAliveConfigured has when compared with bgpPeerHoldTimeConfigured.
If the value of this object is zero (0), it indicates that the KeepAlive timer has not been established with the peer, or, the value of bgpPeerKeepAliveConfigured is zero (0)."
This value is placed in an OPEN message sent to this peer by this BGP speaker, and is compared with the Hold Time field in an OPEN message received from the peer when determining the Hold Time (bgpPeerHoldTime) with the peer.
This value must not be less than three seconds if it is not zero
(0) in which case the Hold Time is NOT to be established with the peer.
The suggested value for this timer is 90 seconds."
"Time interval in seconds for the KeepAlive timer configured for this BGP speaker with this peer.
The value of this object will only determine the KEEPALIVE messages' frequency relative to the value specified in bgpPeerHoldTimeConfigured; the actual time interval for the KEEPALIVE messages is indicated by bgpPeerKeepAlive.
A reasonable maximum value for this timer would be configured to be one third of that of bgpPeerHoldTimeConfigured.
If the value of this object is zero (0), no periodical KEEPALIVE messages are sent to the peer after the BGP connection has been established.
The suggested value for this timer is 30 seconds."
"Time interval in seconds for the MinASOriginationInterval timer.
The suggested value for this timer is 15 seconds."
The suggested value for this timer is 30 seconds."
Elapsed time in seconds since the last BGP UPDATE message was received from the peer.
Each time bgpPeerInUpdates is incremented, the value of this object is set to zero (0)."
