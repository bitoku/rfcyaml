  - "Abstract\n   For historical interest, this document captures the EF Design Team's\n\
    \   proposed solution, preferred by the original authors of RFC 2598 but\n   not\
    \ adopted by the working group in December 2000.  The original\n   definition\
    \ of EF was based on comparison of forwarding on an unloaded\n   network.  This\
    \ experimental Delay Bound (DB) PHB requires a bound on\n   the delay of packets\
    \ due to other traffic in the network.  At the\n   Pittsburgh IETF meeting in\
    \ August 2000, the Differentiated Services\n   working group faced serious questions\
    \ regarding RFC 2598 - the\n   group's standards track definition of the Expedited\
    \ Forwarding (EF)\n   Per Hop Behavior (PHB).  An 'EF Design Team' volunteered\
    \ to develop a\n   re-expression of RFC 2598, bearing in mind the issues raised\
    \ in the\n   DiffServ group.  At the San Diego IETF meeting in December 2000 the\n\
    \   DiffServ working group decided to pursue an alternative re-expression\n  \
    \ of the EF PHB.\n"

- title: 1 Introduction
  contents:
  - "1 Introduction\n   RFC 2598 was the Differentiated Services (DiffServ) working\
    \ group's\n   first standards track definition of the Expedited Forwarding (EF)\
    \ Per\n   Hop Behavior (PHB) [1].  As part of the DiffServ working group's\n \
    \  ongoing refinement of the EF PHB, various issues were raised with the\n   text\
    \ in RFC 2598 [2].\n   After the Pittsburgh IETF meeting in August 2000, a volunteer\
    \ 'EF\n   design team' was formed (the authors of this document) to propose a\n\
    \   new expression of the EF PHB.  The remainder of this Informational\n   document\
    \ captures our feedback to the DiffServ working group at the\n   San Diego IETF\
    \ in December 2000.  Our solution focussed on a Delay\n   Bound (DB) based re-expression\
    \ of RFC 2598 which met the goals of RFC\n   2598's original authors.  The DiffServ\
    \ working group ultimately chose\n   an alternative re-expression of the EF PHB\
    \ text, developed by the\n   authors of [2] and revised to additionally encompass\
    \ our model\n   described here.\n   Our proposed Delay Bound solution is archived\
    \ for historical\n   interest.  Section 2 covers the minimum, necessary and sufficient\n\
    \   description of what we believed qualifies as 'DB' behavior from a\n   single\
    \ node.  Section 3 then discusses a number of issues and\n   assumptions made\
    \ to support the definition in section 2.\n"

  contents:
  - "2. Definition of Delay Bound forwarding\n   For a traffic stream not exceeding\
    \ a particular configured rate, the\n   goal of the DB PHB is a strict bound on\

    \ with the goals and necessary boundary\n   conditions for DB behavior, then provide\
    \ a descriptive definition of\n   DB behavior itself, discuss what it means to\
    \ conform to the DB\n   definition, and assign the experimental DB PHB code point.\n"
- title: 2.1 Goal and Scope of DB
  contents:
  - "2.1 Goal and Scope of DB\n   For a traffic stream not exceeding a configured\
    \ rate the goal of the\n   DB PHB is a strict bound on the delay variation of\
    \ packets through a\n   hop.\n   Traffic MUST be policed and/or shaped at the\
    \ source edge (for\n   example, on ingress to the DS-domain as discussed in RFC\
    \ 2475 [5]) in\n   order to get such a bound.  However, specific policing and/or\
    \ shaping\n   rules are outside the scope of the DB PHB definition.  Such rules\n\
    \   MUST be defined in any per-domain behaviors (PDBs) composed from the\n   DB\
    \ PHB.\n   A device (hop) delivers DB behavior to appropriately marked traffic\n\
    \   received on one or more interfaces (marking is specified in section\n   2.4).\
    \  A device SHALL deliver the DB behavior on an interface to DB\n   marked traffic\
    \ meeting (i.e. less than or equal) a certain arrival\n   rate limit R.\n   If\
    \ more DB traffic arrives than is acceptable, the device is NOT\n   REQUIRED to\
    \ deliver the DB behavior.  However, although the original\n   source of DB traffic\
    \ will be shaped, aggregation and upstream jitter\n   ensure that the traffic\
    \ arriving at any given hop cannot be assumed\n   to be so shaped.  Thus a DB\
    \ implementation SHOULD have some tolerance\n   for burstiness - the ability to\
    \ provide EF behavior even when the\n   arrival rate exceeds the rate limit R.\n\
    \   Different DB implementations are free to exhibit different tolerance\n   to\
    \ burstiness.  (Burstiness MAY be characterized in terms of the\n   number of\
    \ back-to-back wire-rate packets to which the hop can deliver\n   DB behavior.\
    \  However, since the goal of characterizing burstiness is\n   to allow useful\
    \ comparison of DB implementations, vendors and users\n   of DB implementations\
    \ MAY choose to utilize other burstiness\n   metrics.)\n   The DB PHB definition\
    \ does NOT mandate or recommend any particular\n   method for achieving DB behavior.\
    \  Rather, the DB PHB definition\n   identifies parameters that bound the operating\
    \ range(s) over which an\n   implementation can deliver DB behavior.  Implementors\
    \ characterize\n   their implementations using these parameters, while network\
    \ designers\n   and testers use these parameters to assess the utility of different\n\
    \   DB implementations.\n"
- title: 2.2 Description of DB behavior
  contents:
  - "2.2 Description of DB behavior\n   For simplicity the definition will be explained\
    \ using an example\n   where traffic arrives on only one interface and is destined\
    \ for\n   another (single) interface.\n   The crux of this definition is that\
    \ the difference in time between\n   when a packet might have been delivered,\
    \ and when it is delivered,\n   will never exceed a specifiable bound.\n   Given\
    \ an acceptable (not exceeding arrival rate limit R) stream of DB\n   packets\
    \ arriving on an interface:\n      There is a time sequence E(i) when these packets\
    \ would be\n      delivered at the output interface in the absence of competing\n\
    \      traffic.  That is, E(i) are the earliest times that the packets\n     \
    \ could be delivered by the device.\n      In the presence of competing traffic,\
    \ the packets will be delayed\n      to some later time D(i).\n   Competing traffic\
    \ includes all DB traffic arriving at the device on\n   other ports, and all non-DB\
    \ traffic arriving at the device on any\n   port.\n   DB is defined as the behavior\
    \ which ensures, for all i, that:\n      D(i) - E(i) <=  S * MTU/R.\n   MTU is\
    \ the maximum transmission unit (packet size) of the output.  R\n   is the arrival\
    \ rate that the DB device is prepared to accept on this\n   interface.\n   Note\
    \ that D(i) and E(i) simply refer to the times of what can be\n   thought of as\
    \ \"the same packet\" under the two treatments (with and\n   without competing\
    \ traffic).\n   The score, S, is a characteristic of the device at the rate, R,\
    \ in\n   order to meet this defined bound.  This score, preferably a small\n \
    \  constant, depends on the scheduling mechanism and configuration of\n   the\
    \ device.\n"
- title: 2.3 Conformance to DB behavior
  contents:
  - "2.3 Conformance to DB behavior\n   An implementation need not conform to the\
    \ DB specification over an\n   arbitrary range of parameter values.  Instead,\
    \ implementations MUST\n   specify the rates, R, and scores S, for which they\
    \ claim conformance\n   with the DB definition in section 2.2, and the implementation-\n\
    \   specific configuration parameters needed to deliver conformant\n   behavior.\
    \  An implementation SHOULD document the traffic burstiness\n   it can tolerate\
    \ while still providing DB behavior.\n   The score, S, and configuration parameters\
    \ depend on the\n   implementation error from an ideal scheduler.  Discussion\
    \ of the\n   ability of any particular scheduler to provide DB behavior, and the\n\
    \   conditions under which it might do so, is outside the scope of this\n   document.\n\
    \   The implementor MAY define additional constraints on the range of\n   configurations\
    \ in which DB behavior is delivered.  These constraints\n   MAY include limits\
    \ on the total DB traffic across the device, or\n   total DB traffic targeted\
    \ at a given interface from all inputs.\n   This document does not specify any\
    \ requirements on DB\n   implementation's values for R, S, or tolerable burstiness.\
    \  These\n   parameters will be bounded by real-world considerations such as the\n\
    \   actual network being designed and the desired PDB.\n"
- title: 2.4 Marking for DB behavior
  contents:
  - "2.4 Marking for DB behavior\n   One or more DiffServ codepoint (DSCP) value may\
    \ be used to indicate a\n   requirement for DB behavior [4].\n   By default we\
    \ suggest an 'experimental' DSCP of 101111 be used to\n   indicate that DB PHB\
    \ is required.\n"
- title: 3. Discussion
  contents:
  - "3. Discussion\n   This section discusses some issues that might not be immediately\n\
    \   obvious from the definition in section 2.\n"
- title: 3.1 Mutability
  contents:
  - "3.1 Mutability\n   Packets marked for DB PHB MAY be remarked at a DS domain boundary\n\
    \   only to other codepoints that satisfy the DB PHB.  Packets marked for\n  \

- title: 3.2 Tunneling
  contents:

  contents:
  - "3.3 Interaction with other PHBs\n   Other PHBs and PHB groups may be deployed\
    \ in the same DS node or\n   domain with the DB PHB as long as the requirement\
    \ of section 2 is\n   met.\n"
- title: 3.4 Output Rate not specified
  contents:
  - "3.4 Output Rate not specified\n   The definition of DB behavior given in section\
    \ 2 is quite explicitly\n   given in terms of input rate R and output delay variation\
    \ D(i) -\n   E(i).  A scheduler's output rate does not need to be specified, since\n\
    \   (by design) it will be whatever is needed to achieve the target delay\n  \
    \ variation bounds.\n"
- title: 3.5 Jitter
  contents:
  - "3.5 Jitter\n   Jitter is not the bounded parameter in DB behavior.  Jitter can\
    \ be\n   understood in a number of ways, for example the variability in\n   inter-packet\
    \ times from one inter-packet interval to the next.\n   However, DB behavior aims\
    \ to bound a related but different parameter\n   - the variation in delay between\
    \ the time packets would depart in the\n   absence of competing traffic, E(i),\
    \ and when they would depart in the\n   presence of competing traffic, D(i).\n"
- title: 3.6 Multiple Inputs and/or Multiple Outputs
  contents:
  - "3.6 Multiple Inputs and/or Multiple Outputs\n   The definition of 'competing\
    \ traffic' in section 2.2 covers both the\n   single input/single output case\
    \ and the more general case where DB\n   traffic is converging on a single output\
    \ port from multiple input\n   ports.  When evaluating the ability of an DB device\
    \ to offer DB\n   behavior to traffic arriving on one port, DB traffic arriving\
    \ on\n   other ports is factored in as competing traffic.\n   When considering\
    \ DB traffic from a single input that is leaving via\n   multiple ports, it is\
    \ clear that the behavior is no worse than if all\n   of the traffic could be\
    \ leaving through each one of those ports\n   individually (subject to limits\
    \ on how much is permitted).\n"
- title: 3.7 Fragmentation and Rate
  contents:
  - "3.7 Fragmentation and Rate\n   Where an ingress link has an MTU higher than that\
    \ of an egress link,\n   it is conceivable packets may be fragmented as they pass\
    \ through a\n   Diffserv hop.  However, the unpredictability of fragmentation\
    \ is\n   significantly counter to the goal of providing controllable QoS.\n  \
    \ Therefore we assume that fragmentation of DB packets is being avoided\n   (either\
    \ through some form of Path MTU discovery, or configuration),\n   and does not\
    \ need to be specifically considered in the DB behavior\n   definition.\n"
- title: 3.8 Interference with other traffic
  contents:
  - "3.8 Interference with other traffic\n   If the DB PHB is implemented by a mechanism\
    \ that allows unlimited\n   preemption of other traffic (e.g., a priority queue),\
    \ the\n   implementation MUST include some means to limit the damage DB traffic\n\
    \   could inflict on other traffic.  This will be reflected in the DB\n   device's\
    \ burst tolerance described in section 2.1.\n"
- title: 3.9 Micro flow awareness
  contents:
  - "3.9 Micro flow awareness\n   Some DB implementations may choose to provide queuing\
    \ and scheduling\n   at a finer granularity, (for example, per micro flow), than\
    \ is\n   indicated solely by the packet's DSCP.  Such behavior is NOT\n   precluded\
    \ by the DB PHB definition.  However, such behavior is also\n   NOT part of the\
    \ DB PHB definition.  Implementors are free to\n   characterize and publicize\
    \ the additional per micro flow capabilities\n   of their DB implementations as\
    \ they see fit.\n"
- title: 3.10 Arrival rate 'R'
  contents:
  - "3.10 Arrival rate 'R'\n   In the absence of additional information, R is assumed\
    \ to be limited\n   by the slowest interface on the device.\n   In addition, an\
    \ DB device may be characterized by different values of\n   R for different traffic\
    \ flow scenarios (for example, for traffic\n   aimed at different ports, total\
    \ incoming R, and possibly total per\n   output port incoming R across all incoming\
    \ interfaces).\n"
- title: 4. IANA Considerations
  contents:
  - "4. IANA Considerations\n   This document suggests one experimental codepoint,\
    \ 101111.  Because\n   the DSCP is taken from the experimental code space, it\
    \ may be re-used\n   by other experimental or informational DiffServ proposals.\n"
- title: 5. Conclusion.
  contents:
  - "5. Conclusion.\n   This document defines DB behavior in terms of a bound on delay\n\
    \   variation for traffic streams that are rate shaped on ingress to a DS\n  \
    \ domain.  Two parameters - capped arrival rate (R) and a 'score' (S),\n   are\
    \ defined and related to the target delay variation bound.  All\n   claims of\
    \ DB 'conformance' for specific implementations of DB\n   behavior are made with\
    \ respect to particular values for R, S, and the\n   implementation's ability\
    \ to tolerate small amounts of burstiness in\n   the arriving DB traffic stream.\n"
- title: Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "Security Considerations\n   To protect itself against denial of service attacks,\
    \ the edge of a DS\n   domain MUST strictly police all DB marked packets to a\
    \ rate\n   negotiated with the adjacent upstream domain (for example, some value\n\
    \   less than or equal to the capped arrival rate R).  Packets in excess\n   of\
    \ the negotiated rate MUST be dropped.  If two adjacent domains have\n   not negotiated\
    \ an DB rate, the downstream domain MUST use 0 as the\n   rate (i.e., drop all\
    \ DB marked packets).\n   Since PDBs constructed from the DB PHB will require\
    \ that the upstream\n   domain police and shape DB marked traffic to meet the\
    \ rate negotiated\n   with the downstream domain, the downstream domain's policer\
    \ should\n   never have to drop packets.  Thus these drops (or a summary of these\n\
    \   drops) SHOULD be noted (e.g., via rate-limited SNMP traps) as\n   possible\
    \ security violations or serious misconfiguration.\n   Overflow events on an DB\
    \ queue MAY also be logged as indicating\n   possible denial of service attacks\
    \ or serious network\n   misconfiguration.\n"
