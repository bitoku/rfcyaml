- title: Abstract
  contents:
  - "Abstract\n   Many sites connected to the Internet make use of IPv4 addresses\
    \ that\n   are not globally unique.  Examples are the addresses designated in\n\
    \   RFC 1918 for private use within individual sites.\n   Hosts should never normally\
    \ send DNS reverse-mapping queries for\n   those addresses on the public Internet.\
    \  However, such queries are\n   frequently observed.  Authoritative servers are\
    \ deployed to provide\n   authoritative answers to such queries as part of a loosely\n\
    \   coordinated effort known as the AS112 project.\n   Since queries sent to AS112\
    \ servers are usually not intentional, the\n   replies received back from those\
    \ servers are typically unexpected.\n   Unexpected inbound traffic can trigger\
    \ alarms on intrusion detection\n   systems and firewalls, and operators of such\
    \ systems often mistakenly\n   believe that they are being attacked.\n   This\
    \ document provides background information and technical advice to\n   those firewall\
    \ operators.\n"

- title: 1.  Introduction and Target Audience
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction and Target Audience\n   Readers of this document may well have\
    \ experienced an alarm from a\n   firewall or an intrusion-detection system, triggered\
    \ by unexpected\n   inbound traffic from the Internet.  The traffic probably appeared\
    \ to\n   originate from one of several hosts discussed further below.\n   The\
    \ published contacts for those hosts may well have suggested that\n   you consult\
    \ this document.\n   If you are following up on such an event, you are encouraged\
    \ to\n   follow your normal security procedures and take whatever action you\n\
    \   consider to be appropriate.  This document contains information that\n   may\
    \ assist you.\n"
- title: 2.  Private-Use Addresses
  contents:
  - "2.  Private-Use Addresses\n   Many sites connected to the Internet make use of\
    \ address blocks\n   designated in [RFC1918] for private use.  One example of\
    \ such\n   addresses is 10.1.30.20.\n   Because these ranges of addresses are\
    \ used by many sites all over the\n   world, each individual address can only\
    \ ever have local significance.\n   For example, the host numbered 192.168.18.234\
    \ in one site almost\n   certainly has nothing to do with a host with the same\
    \ address located\n   in a different site.\n"
- title: 3.  DNS Reverse Mapping
  contents:
  - "3.  DNS Reverse Mapping\n   The Domain Name System (DNS) [RFC1034] can be used\
    \ to obtain a name\n   for a particular network address.  The process by which\
    \ this happens\n   is as follows:\n   1.  The network address is rearranged in\
    \ order to construct a name\n       that can be looked up in the DNS.  For example,\
    \ the IPv4 address\n       10.1.30.20 corresponds to the DNS name 20.30.1.10.IN-ADDR.ARPA.\n\
    \   2.  A DNS query is constructed for that name, requesting a DNS record\n  \
    \     of the type \"PTR\".\n   3.  The DNS query is sent to a resolver.\n   4.\
    \  If a response is received in response to the query, the answer\n       will\
    \ typically indicate either the hostname corresponding to the\n       network\
    \ address, or the fact that no hostname can be found.\n   This procedure is generally\
    \ carried out automatically by software,\n   and hence is largely hidden from\
    \ users and administrators.\n   Applications might have reason to look up an IP\
    \ address in order to\n   gather extra information for a log file, for example.\n"
- title: 4.  DNS Reverse Mapping for Private-Use Addresses
  contents:
  - "4.  DNS Reverse Mapping for Private-Use Addresses\n   As noted in Section 2,\
    \ private-use addresses have only local\n   significance.  This means that sending\
    \ queries out to the Internet is\n   not sensible: there is no way for the public\
    \ DNS to provide a useful\n   answer to a question that has no global meaning.\n\
    \   Despite the fact that the public DNS cannot provide answers, many\n   sites\
    \ have misconfigurations in the way they connect to the Internet;\n   this results\
    \ in such queries relating to internal infrastructure\n   being sent outside the\
    \ site.  From the perspective of the public DNS,\n   these queries are junk --\
    \ they cannot be answered usefully and result\n   in unnecessary traffic being\
    \ received by the nameservers which\n   underpin the operation of the reverse\
    \ DNS (the so-called reverse\n   servers [RFC5855], which serve \"IN-ADDR.ARPA\"\
    ).\n   To isolate this traffic and reduce the load on the rest of the\n   reverse\
    \ DNS infrastructure, dedicated servers have been deployed in\n   the Internet\
    \ to receive and reply to these junk queries.  These\n   servers are deployed\
    \ in many places in a loosely coordinated effort\n   known as the \"AS112 project\"\
    .  More details about the AS112 project\n   can be found at <http://www.as112.net/>.\n"
- title: 5.  AS112 Nameservers
  contents:
  - "5.  AS112 Nameservers\n   The nameservers responsible for answering queries relating\
    \ to\n   private-use addresses are as follows:\n   o  PRISONER.IANA.ORG (192.175.48.1)\n\
    \   o  BLACKHOLE-1.IANA.ORG (192.175.48.6)\n   o  BLACKHOLE-2.IANA.ORG (192.175.48.42)\n\
    \   A request sent to one of these servers will result in a response\n   being\
    \ returned to the client.  The response will typically be a UDP\n   datagram,\
    \ although it's perfectly valid for requests to be made over\n   TCP.  In both\
    \ cases, the source port of packets returning to the site\n   that originated\
    \ the DNS request will be 53.\n"
- title: 6.  Inbound Traffic from AS112 Servers
  contents:
  - "6.  Inbound Traffic from AS112 Servers\n   Where firewalls or intrusion detection\
    \ systems (IDSs) are configured\n   to block traffic received from AS112 servers,\
    \ superficial review of\n   the traffic may seem alarming to site administrators.\n\
    \   o  Since requests directed ultimately to AS112 servers are usually\n     \
    \ triggered automatically by applications, review of firewall logs\n      may\
    \ indicate a large number of policy violations occurring over an\n      extended\
    \ period of time.\n   o  Where responses from AS112 servers are blocked by firewalls,\
    \ hosts\n      will often retry, often with a relatively high frequency.  This\n\
    \      can cause inbound traffic to be misclassified as a denial-of-\n      service\
    \ (DoS) attack.  In some cases, the source ports used by\n      individual hosts\
    \ for successive retries increase in a predictable\n      fashion (e.g. monotonically),\
    \ which can cause the replies from the\n      AS112 server to resemble a port\
    \ scan.\n   o  A site administrator may attempt to perform active measurement\
    \ of\n      the remote host in response to alarms raised by inbound traffic,\n\
    \      e.g. initiating a port scan in order to gather information about\n    \
    \  the host which is apparently attacking the site.  Such a scan will\n      usually\
    \ result in additional inbound traffic to the site\n      performing the measurement,\
    \ e.g., an apparent flood of ICMP\n      messages that may trigger additional\
    \ firewall alarms and obfuscate\n      the process of identifying the originally\
    \ problematic traffic.\n"
- title: 7.  Corrective Measures
  contents:
  - "7.  Corrective Measures\n   A site that receives responses from one of the nameservers\
    \ listed in\n   Section 5 is probably under no immediate danger, and the traffic\n\
    \   associated with those responses probably requires no emergency action\n  \
    \ by the site concerned.  However, this document cannot aspire to\n   dictate\
    \ the security policy of individual sites, and it is recognised\n   that many\
    \ sites will have perfectly valid policies that dictate that\n   corrective measures\
    \ should be taken to stop the responses from AS112\n   servers.\n   It should\
    \ be noted, however, that the operators of AS112 nameservers,\n   which are generating\
    \ the responses described in this document, are\n   not ultimately responsible\
    \ for the inbound traffic received by the\n   site: that traffic is generated\
    \ in response to queries that are sent\n   out from the site, and so the only\
    \ effective measures to stop the\n   inbound traffic is to prevent the original\
    \ queries from being made.\n   Possible measures that might be taken to prevent\
    \ these queries\n   include:\n   1.  Stop hosts from making these DNS reverse-mapping\
    \ queries in the\n       first place.  In some cases, servers can be configured\
    \ not to\n       perform DNS reverse-mapping lookups, for example.  As a general\n\
    \       site-wide approach, however, this measure is frequently difficult\n  \
    \     to implement due to the large number of hosts and applications\n       involved.\n\
    \   2.  Block DNS reverse-mapping queries to the AS112 servers from\n       leaving\
    \ the site using firewalls between the site and the\n       Internet.  Although\
    \ this might appear to be sensible, such a\n       measure might have unintended\
    \ consequences: the inability to\n       receive an answer to DNS reverse-mapping\
    \ queries might lead to\n       long DNS lookup timeouts, for example, which could\
    \ cause\n       applications to malfunction.  (It may also lead to the belief\n\
    \       that the Internet or the local network is down.)\n   3.  Configure all\
    \ DNS resolvers in the site to answer authoritatively\n       for the zones corresponding\
    \ to the private-use address blocks in\n       use.  This should prevent resolvers\
    \ from ever needing to send\n       these queries to the public DNS.  Guidance\
    \ and recommendations\n       for this aspect of resolver configuration can be\
    \ found in\n       [RFC6303].\n   4.  Implement a private AS112 node within the\
    \ site.  Guidance for\n       constructing an AS112 node may be found in [RFC6304].\n"
