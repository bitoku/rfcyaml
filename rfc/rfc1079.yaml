- title: Status of This Memo
  contents:
  - "Status of This Memo\n   This RFC specifies a standard for the Internet community.\
    \  Hosts on\n   the Internet that exchange terminal speed information within the\n\
    \   Telnet protocol are expected to adopt and implement this standard.\n   Distribution\
    \ of this memo is unlimited.\n   This standard is modelled on RFC 930 [1], the\
    \ telnet terminal type\n   option.  Much of the text of this document is copied\
    \ from that RFC.\n"
- title: Motivation
  contents:
  - "Motivation\n   Most operating systems have provisions to keep track of the speed\n\
    \   (bit rate) of directly attached terminals and modems.  This\n   information\
    \ is used to control various timing-dependent display\n   processes, e.g., the\
    \ number of padding characters used for delay.\n   Some software also has user\
    \ interfaces that are tuned differently for\n   fast and slow terminals.  The\
    \ purpose of this option is to provide\n   similar information for telnet connections.\n"

  - "2. Command Meanings\n      IAC WILL TERMINAL-SPEED\n         Sender is willing\
    \ to send terminal speed information in a\n         subsequent sub-negotiation.\n\
    \      IAC WON'T TERMINAL-SPEED\n         Sender refuses to send terminal speed\
    \ information.\n      IAC DO TERMINAL-SPEED\n         Sender is willing to receive\
    \ terminal speed information in a\n         subsequent sub-negotiation.\n    \
    \  IAC DON'T TERMINAL-SPEED\n         Sender refuses to accept terminal speed\
    \ information.\n      IAC SB TERMINAL-SPEED SEND IAC SE\n         Sender requests\
    \ receiver to transmit his (the receiver's)\n         terminal speed. The code\
    \ for SEND is 1. (See below.)\n      IAC SB TERMINAL-SPEED IS ... IAC SE\n   \
    \      Sender is stating his terminal speed. The code for IS is 0.\n         (See\
    \ below.)\n"
- title: 3. Default
  contents:
  - "3. Default\n      WON'T TERMINAL-SPEED\n         Terminal speed information will\
    \ not be exchanged.\n      DON'T TERMINAL-SPEED\n         Terminal speed information\
    \ will not be exchanged.\n"
- title: 4. Description of the Option
  contents:
  - "4. Description of the Option\n   WILL and DO are used only to obtain and grant\
    \ permission for future\n   discussion. The actual exchange of status information\
    \ occurs within\n   option subcommands (IAC SB TERMINAL-SPEED...).\n   Once the\
    \ two hosts have exchanged a WILL and a DO, the sender of the\n   DO TERMINAL-SPEED\
    \ is free to request speed information.  Only the\n   sender of the DO may send\
    \ requests (IAC SB TERMINAL-SPEED SEND IAC\n   SE) and only the sender of the\
    \ WILL may transmit actual speed\n   information (within an IAC SB TERMINAL-SPEED\
    \ IS ... IAC SE command).\n   Terminal speed information may not be sent spontaneously,\
    \ but only in\n   response to a request.\n   The terminal speed information is\
    \ an NVT ASCII string.  This string\n   contains the decimal representation of\
    \ the transmit and receive\n   speeds of the terminal, separated by a comma, e.g.,\n\
    \         9600,100\n   No leading zeros may be included.  No extraneous characters\
    \ such as\n   spaces may be included.\n      The following is an example of use\
    \ of the option:\n         Host1: IAC DO TERMINAL-SPEED\n         Host2: IAC WILL\
    \ TERMINAL-SPEED\n      (Host1 is now free to request status information at any\
    \ time.)\n         Host1: IAC SB TERMINAL-SPEED SEND IAC SE\n         Host2: IAC\
    \ SB TERMINAL-SPEED IS \"1200,1200\" IAC SE\n      (This command is 15 octets.)\n"
- title: 5. Implementation Suggestions
  contents:
  - "5. Implementation Suggestions\n   Many systems allow only certain discrete terminal\
    \ speeds.  In such\n   cases it is possible that a speed may be received that\
    \ does not match\n   one of the allowed values.  We suggest that you pick the\
    \ nearest\n   speed that is allowed, rounding in a \"safe\" direction.  Safety\
    \ will\n   depend upon the use of the speed information.  If it is being used\n\
    \   for padding, it is best to round up, since too much padding is better\n  \
    \ than too little.\n"
