- title: 1. Introduction

  - "1. Introduction\n   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information\
    \ Base (MIB)\n   for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.\n\
    \   In particular, it describes managed objects used for managing the\n   Border\
    \ Gateway Protocol Version 4 or lower [1, 2].\n"
- title: 2. The SNMPv2 Network Management Framework
  contents:
  - "2. The SNMPv2 Network Management Framework\n   The SNMPv2 Network Management\
    \ Framework consists of four major\n   components.  They are:\n      RFC 1442\
    \ which defines the SMI, the mechanisms used for describing\n      and naming\
    \ objects for the purpose of management.\n      STD 17, RFC 1213 defines MIB-II,\
    \ the core set of managed objects\n      forthe Internet suite of protocols.\n\
    \      RFC 1445 which defines the administrative and other architectural\n   \
    \   aspects of the framework.\n      RFC 1448 which defines the protocol used\
    \ for network access to\n      managed objects.\n   The Framework permits new\
    \ objects to be defined for the purpose of\n   experimentation and evaluation.\n"
- title: 3. Object Definitions
  contents:
  - "3. Object Definitions\n   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information\
    \ store, termed\n   the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB\
    \ are\n   defined using the subset of Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1)\n \
    \  defined in the SMI.  In particular, each object type is named by an\n   OBJECT\
    \ IDENTIFIER, an administratively assigned name.  The object\n   type together\
    \ with an object instance serves to uniquely identify a\n   specific instantiation\
    \ of the object.  For human convenience, we\n   often use a textual string, termed\
    \ the descriptor, to refer to the\n   object type.\n"
- title: 4. Overview
  contents:
  - "4. Overview\n   These objects are used to control and manage a BGP-4 implementation.\n\
    \   Apart from a few system-wide scalar objects, this MIB is broken into\n   three\
    \ tables: the BGP Peer Table, the BGP Received Path Attribute\n   Table, and the\
    \ BGP-4 Received Path Attribute Table. The BGP Peer\n   Table contains information\
    \ about state and current activity of\n   connections with the BGP peers. The\
    \ Received Path Attribute Table\n   contains path attributes received from all\
    \ peers running BGP version\n   3 or less. The BGP-4 Received Path Attribute Table\
    \ contains path\n   attributes received from all BGP-4 peers.  The actual attributes\
    \ used\n   in determining a route are a subset of the received attribute tables\n\
    \   after local routing policy has been applied.\n"
