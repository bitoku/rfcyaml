  - "Abstract\n   This document specifies a message header field called Authentication-\n\
    \   Results for use with electronic mail messages to indicate the results\n  \
    \ of message authentication efforts.  Any receiver-side software, such\n   as\
    \ mail filters or Mail User Agents (MUAs), can use this header field\n   to relay\
    \ that information in a convenient and meaningful way to users\n   or to make\
    \ sorting and filtering decisions.\n"

- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   This document describes a header field called Authentication-Results\n\
    \   for electronic mail messages that presents the results of a message\n   authentication\
    \ effort in a machine-readable format.  The intent of\n   the header field is\
    \ to create a place to collect such data when\n   message authentication mechanisms\
    \ are in use so that a Mail User\n   Agent (MUA) and downstream filters can make\
    \ filtering decisions\n   and/or provide a recommendation to the user as to the\
    \ validity of the\n   message's origin and possibly the safety and integrity of\
    \ its\n   content.\n   This document revises the original definition found in\
    \ [RFC5451]\n   based upon various authentication protocols in current use and\n\
    \   incorporates errata logged since the publication of the original\n   specification.\n\
    \   End users are not expected to be direct consumers of this header\n   field.\
    \  This header field is intended for consumption by programs\n   that will then\
    \ use such data or render it in a human-usable form.\n   This document specifies\
    \ the format of this header field and discusses\n   the implications of its presence\
    \ or absence.  However, it does not\n   discuss how the data contained in the\
    \ header field ought to be used,\n   such as what filtering decisions are appropriate\
    \ or how an MUA might\n   render those results, as these are local policy and/or\
    \ user interface\n   design questions that are not appropriate for this document.\n\
    \   At the time of publication of this document, the following are\n   published,\
    \ domain-level email authentication methods in common use:\n   o  Author Domain\
    \ Signing Practices ([ADSP])\n   o  SMTP Service Extension for Authentication\
    \ ([AUTH])\n   o  DomainKeys Identified Mail Signatures ([DKIM])\n   o  Sender\
    \ Policy Framework ([SPF])\n   o  Vouch By Reference ([VBR])\n   o  reverse IP\
    \ address name validation (\"iprev\", defined in Section 3)\n   In addition, the\
    \ following are non-standard methods recognized by\n   this specification that\
    \ are no longer common:\n   o  DomainKeys ([DOMAINKEYS]) (Historic)\n   o  Sender\
    \ ID ([SENDERID]) (Experimental)\n   This specification is not intended to be\
    \ restricted to domain-based\n   authentication schemes, but the existing schemes\
    \ in that family have\n   proven to be a good starting point for implementations.\
    \  The goal is\n   to give current and future authentication schemes a common\
    \ framework\n   within which to deliver their results to downstream agents and\n\
    \   discourage the creation of unique header fields for each.\n   Although SPF\
    \ defined a header field called \"Received-SPF\" and the\n   historic DomainKeys\
    \ defined one called \"DomainKey-Status\" for this\n   purpose, those header fields\
    \ are specific to the conveyance of their\n   respective results only and thus\
    \ are insufficient to satisfy the\n   requirements enumerated below.  In addition,\
    \ many SPF implementations\n   have adopted the header field specified here at\
    \ least as an option,\n   and DomainKeys has been obsoleted by DKIM.\n"
- title: 1.1.  Purpose
  contents:
  - "1.1.  Purpose\n   The header field defined in this document is expected to serve\n\
    \   several purposes:\n   1.  Convey the results of various message authentication\
    \ checks,\n       which are applied by upstream filters and Mail Transfer Agents\n\
    \       (MTAs) and then passed to MUAs and downstream filters within the\n   \
    \    same \"trust domain\".  Such agents might wish to render those\n       results\
    \ to end users or to use those data to apply more or less\n       stringent content\
    \ checks based on authentication results;\n   2.  Provide a common location within\
    \ a message for this data;\n   3.  Create an extensible framework for reporting\
    \ new authentication\n       methods as they emerge.\n   In particular, the mere\
    \ presence of this header field does not mean\n   its contents are valid.  Rather,\
    \ the header field is reporting\n   assertions made by one or more authentication\
    \ schemes (supposedly)\n   applied somewhere upstream.  For an MUA or downstream\
    \ filter to treat\n   the assertions as actually valid, there must be an assessment\
    \ of the\n   trust relationship among such agents, the validating MTA, and the\n\
    \   mechanism for conveying the information.\n"
- title: 1.2.  Trust Boundary
  contents:
  - "1.2.  Trust Boundary\n   This document makes several references to the \"trust\
    \ boundary\" of an\n   administrative management domain (ADMD).  Given the diversity\
    \ among\n   existing mail environments, a precise definition of this term isn't\n\
    \   possible.\n   Simply put, a transfer from the producer of the header field\
    \ to the\n   consumer must occur within a context that permits the consumer to\n\
    \   treat assertions by the producer as being reliable and accurate\n   (trustworthy).\
    \  How this trust is obtained is outside the scope of\n   this document.  It is\
    \ entirely a local matter.\n   Thus, this document defines a \"trust boundary\"\
    \ as the delineation\n   between \"external\" and \"internal\" entities.  Services\
    \ that are\n   internal -- within the trust boundary -- are provided by the ADMD's\n\
    \   infrastructure for its users.  Those that are external are outside of\n  \
    \ the authority of the ADMD.  By this definition, hosts that are within\n   a\
    \ trust boundary are subject to the ADMD's authority and policies,\n   independent\
    \ of their physical placement or their physical operation.\n   For example, a\
    \ host within a trust boundary might actually be\n   operated by a remote service\
    \ provider and reside physically within\n   its data center.\n   It is possible\
    \ for a message to be evaluated inside a trust boundary\n   but then depart and\
    \ re-enter the trust boundary.  An example might be\n   a forwarded message such\
    \ as a message/rfc822 attachment (see\n   Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions\
    \ [MIME]) or one that is part of\n   a multipart/digest.  The details reported\
    \ by this field cannot be\n   trusted in that case.  Thus, this field found within\
    \ one of those\n   media types is typically ignored.\n"
- title: 1.3.  Processing Scope
  contents:
  - "1.3.  Processing Scope\n   The content of this header field is meant to convey\
    \ to message\n   consumers that authentication work on the message was already\
    \ done\n   within its trust boundary, and those results are being presented. \
    \ It\n   is not intended to provide message parameters to consumers so that\n\
    \   they can perform authentication protocols on their own.\n"
- title: 1.4.  Requirements
  contents:
  - "1.4.  Requirements\n   This document establishes no new requirements on existing\
    \ protocols\n   or servers.\n   In particular, this document establishes no requirement\
    \ on MTAs to\n   reject or filter arriving messages that do not pass authentication\n\
    \   checks.  The data conveyed by the specified header field's contents\n   are\
    \ for the information of MUAs and filters and are to be used at\n   their discretion.\n"
- title: 1.5.  Definitions
  contents:

    \ document.\n"
- title: 1.5.1.  Key Words

    SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\"\
    , and \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n   document are to be interpreted as described in\
    \ [KEYWORDS].\n"
- title: 1.5.2.  Security
  contents:
  - "1.5.2.  Security\n   \"Guidelines for Writing RFC Text on Security Considerations\"\
    \n   ([SECURITY]) discusses authentication and authorization and the\n   conflation\
    \ of the two concepts.  The use of those terms within the\n   context of recent\
    \ message security work has given rise to slightly\n   different definitions,\
    \ and this document reflects those current\n   usages, as follows:\n   o  \"Authorization\"\
    \ is the establishment of permission to use a\n      resource or represent an\
    \ identity.  In this context, authorization\n      indicates that a message from\
    \ a particular ADMD arrived via a\n      route the ADMD has explicitly approved.\n\
    \   o  \"Authentication\" is the assertion of validity of a piece of data\n  \
    \    about a message (such as the sender's identity) or the message in\n     \
    \ its entirety.\n   As examples: SPF and Sender ID are authorization mechanisms\
    \ in that\n   they express a result that shows whether or not the ADMD that\n\
    \   apparently sent the message has explicitly authorized the connecting\n   Simple\
    \ Mail Transfer Protocol ([SMTP]) client to relay messages on\n   its behalf,\
    \ but they do not actually validate any other property of\n   the message itself.\
    \  By contrast, DKIM is agnostic as to the routing\n   of a message but uses cryptographic\
    \ signatures to authenticate\n   agents, assign (some) responsibility for the\
    \ message (which implies\n   authorization), and ensure that the listed portions\
    \ of the message\n   were not modified in transit.  Since the signatures are not\
    \ tied to\n   SMTP connections, they can be added by either the ADMD of origin,\n\
    \   intermediate ADMDs (such as a mailing list server), other handling\n   agents,\
    \ or any combination.\n   Rather than create a separate header field for each\
    \ class of\n   solution, this proposal groups them both into a single header field.\n"
- title: 1.5.3.  Email Architecture
  contents:
  - "1.5.3.  Email Architecture\n   o  A \"border MTA\" is an MTA that acts as a gateway\
    \ between the\n      general Internet and the users within an organizational boundary.\n\
    \      (See also Section 1.2.)\n   o  A \"delivery MTA\" (or Mail Delivery Agent\
    \ or MDA) is an MTA that\n      actually enacts delivery of a message to a user's\

    \ are some sites at which the entire mail infrastructure consists\n   of a single\
    \ host.  In such cases, such terms as \"border MTA\" and\n   \"delivery MTA\"\

    \ also possible that some message authentication\n   tests could take place on\

- title: 1.6.  Trust Environment
  contents:
  - "1.6.  Trust Environment\n   This header field permits one or more message validation\
    \ mechanisms\n   to communicate output to one or more separate assessment mechanisms.\n\
    \   These mechanisms operate within a unified trust boundary that defines\n  \
    \ an Administrative Management Domain (ADMD).  An ADMD contains one or\n   more\
    \ entities that perform validation and generate the header field\n   and one or\
    \ more that consume it for some type of assessment.  The\n   field often contains\
    \ no integrity or validation mechanism of its own,\n   so its presence must be\
    \ trusted implicitly.  Hence, valid use of the\n   header field requires removing\
    \ any occurrences of it that are present\n   when the message enters the ADMD.\
    \  This ensures that later\n   occurrences have been added within the trust boundary\
    \ of the ADMD.\n   The authserv-id token defined in Section 2.2 can be used to\
    \ reference\n   an entire ADMD or a specific validation engine within an ADMD.\n\

  - "2.1.  General Description\n   The header field specified here is called Authentication-Results.\
    \  It\n   is a Structured Header Field as defined in Internet Message Format\n\
    \   ([MAIL]), and thus all of the related definitions in that document\n   apply.\n\
    \   This header field is added at the top of the message as it transits\n   MTAs\
    \ that do authentication checks, so some idea of how far away the\n   checks were\
    \ done can be inferred.  It is therefore considered to be a\n   trace field as\
    \ defined in [MAIL], and thus all of the related\n   definitions in that document\
    \ apply.\n   The value of the header field (after removing comments) consists\
    \ of\n   an authentication identifier, an optional version, and then a series\n\
    \   of statements and supporting data.  The statements are of the form\n   \"\
    method=result\" and indicate which authentication method(s) were\n   applied and\
    \ their respective results.  For each such statement, the\n   supporting data\
    \ can include a \"reason\" string and one or more\n   \"property=value\" statements\
    \ indicating which message properties were\n   evaluated to reach that conclusion.\n\
    \   The header field can appear more than once in a single message, more\n   than\
    \ one result can be represented in a single header field, or a\n   combination\

- title: 2.3.  The "policy" ptype
  contents:
  - "2.3.  The \"policy\" ptype\n   A special ptype value of \"policy\" is defined.\
    \  This ptype is provided\n   to indicate that some local policy mechanism was\
    \ applied that\n   augments or even replaces (i.e., overrides) the result returned\
    \ by\n   the authentication mechanism.  The property and value in this case\n\
    \   identify the local policy that was applied and the result it\n   returned.\n\
    \   For example, a DKIM signature is not required to include the Subject\n   header\
    \ field in the set of fields that are signed.  An ADMD receiving\n   such a message\
    \ might decide that such a signature is unacceptable,\n   even if it passes, because\
    \ the content of the Subject header field\n   could be altered post-signing without\
    \ invalidating the signature.\n   Such an ADMD could replace the DKIM \"pass\"\
    \ result with a \"policy\"\n   result and then also include the following in the\
    \ corresponding\n   Authentication-Result field:\n      ... dkim=fail policy.dkim-rules=unsigned-subject\
    \ ...\n   In this case, the property is \"dkim-rules\", indicating some local\n\
    \   check by that name took place and that check returned a result of\n   \"unsigned-subject\"\
    .  These are arbitrary names selected by (and\n   presumably used within) the\
    \ ADMD making use of them, so they are not\n   normally registered with IANA or\
    \ otherwise specified apart from\n   setting syntax restrictions that allow for\
    \ easy parsing within the\n   rest of the header field.\n   This ptype existed\
    \ in the original specification for this header\n   field, but without a complete\
    \ description or example of intended use.\n   As a result, it has not seen any\
    \ practical use to date that matches\n   its intended purpose.  These added details\
    \ are provided to guide\n   implementers toward proper use.\n"
- title: 2.4.  Authentication Identifier Field
  contents:
  - "2.4.  Authentication Identifier Field\n   Every Authentication-Results header\
    \ field has an authentication\n   service identifier field (authserv-id above).\
    \  Specifically, this is\n   any string intended to identify the authentication\
    \ service within the\n   ADMD that conducted authentication checks on the message.\
    \  This\n   identifier is intended to be machine-readable and not necessarily\n\
    \   meaningful to users.\n   Since agents consuming this field will use this identifier\
    \ to\n   determine whether its contents are of interest (and are safe to use),\n\
    \   the uniqueness of the identifier MUST be guaranteed by the ADMD that\n   generates\
    \ it and MUST pertain to that ADMD.  MUAs or downstream\n   filters SHOULD use\
    \ this identifier to determine whether or not the\n   data contained in an Authentication-Results\
    \ header field ought to be\n   used or ignored.\n   For simplicity and scalability,\
    \ the authentication service identifier\n   SHOULD be a common token used throughout\
    \ the ADMD.  Common practice\n   is to use the DNS domain name used by or within\
    \ that ADMD, sometimes\n   called the \"organizational domain\", but this is not\
    \ strictly\n   necessary.\n   For tracing and debugging purposes, the authentication\
    \ identifier can\n   instead be the specific hostname of the MTA performing the\n\
    \   authentication check whose result is being reported.  Moreover, some\n   implementations\
    \ define a substructure to the identifier; these are\n   outside of the scope\
    \ of this specification.\n   Note, however, that using a local, relative identifier\
    \ like a flat\n   hostname, rather than a hierarchical and globally unique ADMD\n\
    \   identifier like a DNS domain name, makes configuration more difficult\n  \
    \ for large sites.  The hierarchical identifier permits aggregating\n   related,\
    \ trusted systems together under a single, parent identifier,\n   which in turn\
    \ permits assessing the trust relationship with a single\n   reference.  The alternative\
    \ is a flat namespace requiring\n   individually listing each trusted system.\
    \  Since consumers will use\n   the identifier to determine whether to use the\
    \ contents of the header\n   field:\n   o  Changes to the identifier impose a\
    \ large, centralized\n      administrative burden.\n   o  Ongoing administrative\
    \ changes require constantly updating this\n      centralized table, making it\
    \ difficult to ensure that an MUA or\n      downstream filter will have access\
    \ to accurate information for\n      assessing the usability of the header field's\
    \ content.  In\n      particular, consumers of the header field will need to know\
    \ not\n      only the current identifier(s) in use but previous ones as well to\n\
    \      account for delivery latency or later re-assessment of the header\n   \
    \   field's contents.\n   Examples of valid authentication identifiers are \"\
    example.com\",\n   \"mail.example.org\", \"ms1.newyork.example.com\", and \"example-auth\"\
    .\n"
- title: 2.5.  Version Tokens
  contents:
  - "2.5.  Version Tokens\n   The grammar above provides for the optional inclusion\
    \ of versions on\n   both the header field itself (attached to the authserv-id\
    \ token) and\n   on each of the methods being reported.  The method version refers\
    \ to\n   the method itself, which is specified in the documents describing\n \
    \  those methods, while the authserv-id version refers to this document\n   and\
    \ thus the syntax of this header field.\n   The purpose of including these is\
    \ to avoid misinterpretation of the\n   results.  That is, if a parser finds a\
    \ version after an authserv-id\n   that it does not explicitly know, it can immediately\
    \ discontinue\n   trying to parse since what follows might not be in an expected\n\
    \   format.  For a method version, the parser SHOULD ignore a method\n   result\
    \ if the version is not supported in case the semantics of the\n   result have\
    \ a different meaning than what is expected.  For example,\n   if a hypothetical\
    \ DKIM version 2 yielded a \"pass\" result for\n   different reasons than version\
    \ 1 does, a consumer of this field might\n   not want to use the altered semantics.\
    \  Allowing versions in the\n   syntax is a way to indicate this and let the consumer\
    \ of the header\n   field decide.\n"
- title: 2.6.  Defined Methods and Result Values
  contents:

    \ returns one of a set of\n   specific result values.  The subsections below provide\
    \ references to\n   the documents defining the authentication methods specifically\n\
    \   supported by this document, and their corresponding result values.\n   Verifiers\
    \ SHOULD use these values as described below.  New methods\n   not specified in\
    \ this document, but intended to be supported by the\n   header field defined\
    \ here, MUST include a similar result table either\n   in their defining documents\

  contents:
  - "2.6.1.  DKIM and DomainKeys\n   DKIM is represented by the \"dkim\" method and\

    \ it is to be\n   treated as an unsigned message.  A report of \"fail\" here permits\
    \ the\n   receiver of the report to decide how to handle the failure.  A report\n\

- title: 3.  The "iprev" Authentication Method
  contents:
  - "3.  The \"iprev\" Authentication Method\n   This section defines an additional\
    \ authentication method called\n   \"iprev\".\n   \"iprev\" is an attempt to verify\
    \ that a client appears to be valid\n   based on some DNS queries, which is to\
    \ say that the IP address is\n   explicitly associated with a domain name.  Upon\
    \ receiving a session\n   initiation of some kind from a client, the IP address\
    \ of the client\n   peer is queried for matching names (i.e., a number-to-name\n\
    \   translation, also known as a \"reverse lookup\" or a \"PTR\" record\n   query).\
    \  Once that result is acquired, a lookup of each of the names\n   (i.e., a name-to-number\
    \ translation, or an \"A\" or \"AAAA\" record\n   query) thus retrieved is done.\
    \  The response to this second check\n   will typically result in at least one\
    \ mapping back to the client's IP\n   address.\n   Expressed as an algorithm:\
    \ If the client peer's IP address is I, the\n   list of names to which I maps\
    \ (after a \"PTR\" query) is the set N, and\n   the union of IP addresses to which\
    \ each member of N maps (after\n   corresponding \"A\" and \"AAAA\" queries) is\
    \ L, then this test is\n   successful if I is an element of L.\n   The response\
    \ to a PTR query could contain multiple names.  To prevent\n   heavy DNS loads,\
    \ agents performing these queries MUST be implemented\n   such that the number\
    \ of names evaluated by generation of\n   corresponding A or AAAA queries is limited\
    \ so as not to be unduly\n   taxing to the DNS infrastructure, though it MAY be\
    \ configurable by an\n   administrator.  As an example, Section 5.5 of [SPF] chose\
    \ a limit of\n   10 for its implementation of this algorithm.\n   \"DNS Extensions\
    \ to Support IP Version 6\" ([DNS-IP6]) discusses the\n   query formats for the\
    \ IPv6 case.\n   There is some contention regarding the wisdom and reliability\
    \ of this\n   test.  For example, in some regions, it can be difficult for this\n\
    \   test ever to pass because the practice of arranging to match the\n   forward\
    \ and reverse DNS is infrequently observed.  Therefore, the\n   precise implementation\
    \ details of how a verifier performs an \"iprev\"\n   test are not specified here.\
    \  The verifier MAY report a successful or\n   failed \"iprev\" test at its discretion\
    \ having done some kind of check\n   of the validity of the connection's identity\
    \ using DNS.  It is\n   incumbent upon an agent making use of the reported \"\
    iprev\" result to\n   understand what exactly that particular verifier is attempting\
    \ to\n   report.\n   Extensive discussion of reverse DNS mapping and its implications\
    \ can\n   be found in \"Considerations for the use of DNS Reverse Mapping\"\n\
    \   ([DNSOP-REVERSE]).  In particular, it recommends that applications\n   avoid\
    \ using this test as a means of authentication or security.  Its\n   presence\
    \ in this document is not an endorsement but is merely\n   acknowledgement that\
    \ the method remains common and provides the means\n   to relay the results of\
    \ that test.\n"
- title: 4.  Adding the Header Field to a Message
  contents:
  - "4.  Adding the Header Field to a Message\n   This specification makes no attempt\
    \ to evaluate the relative\n   strengths of various message authentication methods\
    \ that may become\n   available.  The methods listed are an order-independent\
    \ set; their\n   sequence does not indicate relative strength or importance of\
    \ one\n   method over another.  Instead, the MUA or downstream filter consuming\n\
    \   this header field is to interpret the result of each method based on\n   its\
    \ own knowledge of what that method evaluates.\n   Each \"method\" MUST refer\
    \ to an authentication method declared in the\n   IANA registry or an extension\
    \ method as described in Section 2.6.6,\n   and each \"result\" MUST refer to\
    \ a result code declared in the IANA\n   registry or an extension result code\
    \ as defined in Section 2.6.7.\n   See Section 6 for further information about\
    \ the registered methods\n   and result codes.\n   An MTA compliant with this\
    \ specification adds this header field\n   (after performing one or more message\
    \ authentication tests) to\n   indicate which MTA or ADMD performed the test,\
    \ which test got\n   applied, and what the result was.  If an MTA applies more\
    \ than one\n   such test, it adds this header field either once per test or once\n\
    \   indicating all of the results.  An MTA MUST NOT add a result to an\n   existing\
    \ header field.\n   An MTA MAY add this header field containing only the authentication\n\
    \   identifier portion and the \"none\" token (see Section 2.2) to indicate\n\
    \   explicitly that no message authentication schemes were applied prior\n   to\
    \ delivery of this message.\n   An MTA adding this header field has to take steps\
    \ to identify it as\n   legitimate to the MUAs or downstream filters that will\
    \ ultimately\n   consume its content.  One process to do so is described in Section\
    \ 5.\n   Further measures may be necessary in some environments.  Some\n   possible\
    \ solutions are enumerated in Section 7.1.  This document does\n   not mandate\
    \ any specific solution to this issue as each environment\n   has its own facilities\
    \ and limitations.\n   Most known message authentication methods focus on a particular\n\
    \   identifier to evaluate.  SPF and Sender ID differ in that they can\n   yield\
    \ a result based on more than one identifier; specifically, SPF\n   can evaluate\
    \ the RFC5321.HELO parameter or the RFC5321.MailFrom\n   parameter, and Sender\
    \ ID can evaluate the RFC5321.MailFrom parameter\n   or the Purported Responsible\
    \ Address (PRA) identity.  When generating\n   this field to report those results,\
    \ only the parameter that yielded\n   the result is included.\n   For MTAs that\
    \ add this header field, adding header fields in order\n   (at the top), per Section\
    \ 3.6 of [MAIL], is particularly important.\n   Moreover, this header field SHOULD\
    \ be inserted above any other trace\n   header fields such MTAs might prepend.\
    \  This placement allows easy\n   detection of header fields that can be trusted.\n\
    \   End users making direct use of this header field might inadvertently\n   trust\
    \ information that has not been properly vetted.  If, for\n   example, a basic\
    \ SPF result were to be relayed that claims an\n   authenticated addr-spec, the\
    \ local-part of that addr-spec has\n   actually not been authenticated.  Thus,\
    \ an MTA adding this header\n   field SHOULD NOT include any data that has not\
    \ been authenticated by\n   the method(s) being applied.  Moreover, MUAs SHOULD\
    \ NOT render to\n   users such information if it is presented by a method known\
    \ not to\n   authenticate it.\n"

  contents:
  - "4.1.  Header Field Position and Interpretation\n   In order to ensure non-ambiguous\
    \ results and avoid the impact of\n   false header fields, MUAs and downstream\
    \ filters SHOULD NOT interpret\n   this header field unless specifically configured\
    \ to do so by the user\n   or administrator.  That is, this interpretation should\
    \ not be \"on by\n   default\".  Naturally then, users or administrators ought\
    \ not activate\n   such a feature unless they are certain the header field will\
    \ be\n   validly added by an agent within the ADMD that accepts the mail that\n\
    \   is ultimately read by the MUA, and instances of the header field\n   appearing\
    \ to originate within the ADMD but are actually added by\n   foreign MTAs will\
    \ be removed before delivery.\n   Furthermore, MUAs and downstream filters SHOULD\
    \ NOT interpret this\n   header field unless the authentication service identifier\
    \ it bears\n   appears to be one used within its own ADMD as configured by the\
    \ user\n   or administrator.\n   MUAs and downstream filters MUST ignore any result\
    \ reported using a\n   \"result\" not specified in the IANA \"Result Code\" registry\
    \ or a\n   \"ptype\" not listed in the corresponding registry for such values\
    \ as\n   defined in Section 6.  Moreover, such agents MUST ignore a result\n \
    \  indicated for any \"method\" they do not specifically support.\n   An MUA SHOULD\
    \ NOT reveal these results to end users, absent careful\n   human factors design\
    \ considerations and testing, for the presentation\n   of trust-related materials.\
    \  For example, an attacker could register\n   examp1e.com (note the digit \"\
    one\") and send signed mail to intended\n   victims; a verifier would detect that\
    \ the signature was valid and\n   report a \"pass\" even though it's clear the\
    \ DNS domain name was\n   intended to mislead.  See Section 7.2 for further discussion.\n\
    \   As stated in Section 2.1, this header field MUST be treated as though\n  \
    \ it were a trace header field as defined in Section 3.6.7 of [MAIL]\n   and hence\
    \ MUST NOT be reordered and MUST be prepended to the message,\n   so that there\
    \ is generally some indication upon delivery of where in\n   the chain of handling\
    \ MTAs the message authentication was done.\n   Note that there are a few message\
    \ handlers that are only capable of\n   appending new header fields to a message.\
    \  Strictly speaking, these\n   handlers are not compliant with this specification.\
    \  They can still\n   add the header field to carry authentication details, but\
    \ any signal\n   about where in the handling chain the work was done may be lost.\n\
    \   Consumers SHOULD be designed such that this can be tolerated,\n   especially\
    \ from a producer known to have this limitation.\n   MUAs SHOULD ignore instances\
    \ of this header field discovered within\n   message/rfc822 MIME attachments.\n\
    \   Further discussion of these topics can be found in Section 7 below.\n"
- title: 4.2.  Local Policy Enforcement
  contents:
  - "4.2.  Local Policy Enforcement\n   Some sites have a local policy that considers\
    \ any particular\n   authentication policy's non-recoverable failure results (typically\n\
    \   \"fail\" or similar) as justification for rejecting the message.  In\n   such\
    \ cases, the border MTA SHOULD issue an SMTP rejection response to\n   the message,\
    \ rather than adding this header field and allowing the\n   message to proceed\
    \ toward delivery.  This is more desirable than\n   allowing the message to reach\
    \ an internal host's MTA or spam filter,\n   thus possibly generating a local\
    \ rejection such as a Delivery Status\n   Notification (DSN) [DSN] to a forged\
    \ originator.  Such generated\n   rejections are colloquially known as \"backscatter\"\
    .\n   The same MAY also be done for local policy decisions overriding the\n  \
    \ results of the authentication methods (e.g., the \"policy\" result\n   codes\
    \ described in Section 2.6).\n   Such rejections at the SMTP protocol level are\
    \ not possible if local\n   policy is enforced at the MUA and not the MTA.\n"
- title: 5.  Removing Existing Header Fields
  contents:
  - "5.  Removing Existing Header Fields\n   For security reasons, any MTA conforming\
    \ to this specification MUST\n   delete any discovered instance of this header\
    \ field that claims, by\n   virtue of its authentication service identifier, to\
    \ have been added\n   within its trust boundary but that did not come directly\
    \ from another\n   trusted MTA.  For example, an MTA for example.com receiving\
    \ a message\n   MUST delete or otherwise obscure any instance of this header field\n\
    \   bearing an authentication service identifier indicating that the\n   header\
    \ field was added within example.com prior to adding its own\n   header fields.\
    \  This could mean each MTA will have to be equipped\n   with a list of internal\
    \ MTAs known to be compliant (and hence\n   trustworthy).\n   For simplicity and\
    \ maximum security, a border MTA could remove all\n   instances of this header\
    \ field on mail crossing into its trust\n   boundary.  However, this may conflict\
    \ with the desire to access\n   authentication results performed by trusted external\
    \ service\n   providers.  It may also invalidate signed messages whose signatures\n\
    \   cover external instances of this header field.  A more robust border\n   MTA\
    \ could allow a specific list of authenticating MTAs whose\n   information is\
    \ to be admitted, removing the header field originating\n   from all others.\n\
    \   As stated in Section 1.2, a formal definition of \"trust boundary\" is\n \
    \  deliberately not made here.  It is entirely possible that a border\n   MTA\
    \ for example.com will explicitly trust authentication results\n   asserted by\
    \ upstream host example.net even though they exist in\n   completely disjoint\
    \ administrative boundaries.  In that case, the\n   border MTA MAY elect not to\
    \ delete those results; moreover, the\n   upstream host doing some authentication\
    \ work could apply a signing\n   technology such as [DKIM] on its own results\
    \ to assure downstream\n   hosts of their authenticity.  An example of this is\
    \ provided in\n   Appendix C.\n   Similarly, in the case of messages signed using\
    \ [DKIM] or other\n   message-signing methods that sign header fields, this removal\
    \ action\n   could invalidate one or more signatures on the message if they\n\
    \   covered the header field to be removed.  This behavior can be\n   desirable\
    \ since there's little value in validating the signature on a\n   message with\
    \ forged header fields.  However, signing agents MAY\n   therefore elect to omit\
    \ these header fields from signing to avoid\n   this situation.\n   An MTA SHOULD\
    \ remove any instance of this header field bearing a\n   version (express or implied)\
    \ that it does not support.  However, an\n   MTA MUST remove such a header field\
    \ if the [SMTP] connection relaying\n   the message is not from a trusted internal\
    \ MTA.  This means the MTA\n   needs to be able to understand versions of this\
    \ header field at least\n   as late as the ones understood by the MUAs or other\
    \ consumers within\n   its ADMD.\n"

- title: 7.1.  Forged Header Fields
  contents:
  - "7.1.  Forged Header Fields\n   An MUA or filter that accesses a mailbox whose\
    \ messages are handled\n   by a non-conformant MTA, and understands Authentication-Results\n\
    \   header fields, could potentially make false conclusions based on\n   forged\
    \ header fields.  A malicious user or agent could forge a header\n   field using\
    \ the DNS domain of a receiving ADMD as the authserv-id\n   token in the value\
    \ of the header field and, with the rest of the\n   value, claim that the message\
    \ was properly authenticated.  The non-\n   conformant MTA would fail to strip\
    \ the forged header field, and the\n   MUA could inappropriately trust it.\n \
    \  For this reason, it is best not to have processing of the\n   Authentication-Results\
    \ header field enabled by default; instead, it\n   should be ignored, at least\
    \ for the purposes of enacting filtering\n   decisions, unless specifically enabled\
    \ by the user or administrator\n   after verifying that the border MTA is compliant.\
    \  It is acceptable\n   to have an MUA aware of this specification but have an\
    \ explicit list\n   of hostnames whose Authentication-Results header fields are\n\
    \   trustworthy; however, this list should initially be empty.\n   Proposed alternative\
    \ solutions to this problem were made some time\n   ago and are listed below.\
    \  To date, they have not been developed due\n   to lack of demand but are documented\
    \ here should the information be\n   useful at some point in the future:\n   1.\
    \  Possibly the simplest is a digital signature protecting the\n       header\
    \ field, such as using [DKIM], that can be verified by an\n       MUA by using\
    \ a posted public key.  Although one of the main\n       purposes of this document\
    \ is to relieve the burden of doing\n       message authentication work at the\
    \ MUA, this only requires that\n       the MUA learn a single authentication scheme\
    \ even if a number of\n       them are in use at the border MTA.  Note that [DKIM]\
    \ requires\n       that the From header field be signed, although in this\n  \
    \     application, the signing agent (a trusted MTA) likely cannot\n       authenticate\
    \ that value, so the fact that it is signed should be\n       ignored.  Where\
    \ the authserv-id is the ADMD's domain name, the\n       authserv-id matching\
    \ this valid internal signature's \"d=\" DKIM\n       value is sufficient.\n \
    \  2.  Another would be a means to interrogate the MTA that added the\n      \
    \ header field to see if it is actually providing any message\n       authentication\
    \ services and saw the message in question, but this\n       isn't especially\
    \ palatable given the work required to craft and\n       implement such a scheme.\n\
    \   3.  Yet another might be a method to interrogate the internal MTAs\n     \
    \  that apparently handled the message (based on Received header\n       fields)\
    \ to determine whether any of them conform to Section 5 of\n       this memo.\
    \  This, too, has potentially high barriers to entry.\n   4.  Extensions to [IMAP],\
    \ [SMTP], and [POP3] could be defined to\n       allow an MUA or filtering agent\
    \ to acquire the authserv-id in use\n       within an ADMD, thus allowing it to\
    \ identify which\n       Authentication-Results header fields it can trust.\n\
    \   5.  On the presumption that internal MTAs are fully compliant with\n     \
    \  Section 3.6 of [MAIL] and the compliant internal MTAs are using\n       their\
    \ own hostnames or the ADMD's DNS domain name as the\n       authserv-id token,\
    \ the header field proposed here should always\n       appear above a Received\
    \ header added by a trusted MTA.  This can\n       be used as a test for header\
    \ field validity.\n   Support for some of these is being considered for future\
    \ work.\n   In any case, a mechanism needs to exist for an MUA or filter to\n\
    \   verify that the host that appears to have added the header field (a)\n   actually\
    \ did so and (b) is legitimately adding that header field for\n   this delivery.\
    \  Given the variety of messaging environments deployed\n   today, consensus appears\
    \ to be that specifying a particular mechanism\n   for doing so is not appropriate\
    \ for this document.\n   Mitigation of the forged header field attack can also\
    \ be accomplished\n   by moving the authentication results data into metadata\
    \ associated\n   with the message.  In particular, an [SMTP] extension could be\n\
    \   established to communicate authentication results from the border MTA\n  \
    \ to intermediate and delivery MTAs; the latter of these could arrange\n   to\
    \ store the authentication results as metadata retrieved and\n   rendered along\
    \ with the message by an [IMAP] client aware of a\n   similar extension in that\
    \ protocol.  The delivery MTA would be told\n   to trust data via this extension\
    \ only from MTAs it trusts, and border\n   MTAs would not accept data via this\
    \ extension from any source.  There\n   is no vector in such an arrangement for\
    \ forgery of authentication\n   data by an outside agent.\n"

  - "7.3.  Header Field Position\n   Despite the requirements of [MAIL], header fields\
    \ can sometimes be\n   reordered en route by intermediate MTAs.  The goal of requiring\n\
    \   header field addition only at the top of a message is an\n   acknowledgement\
    \ that some MTAs do reorder header fields, but most do\n   not.  Thus, in the\
    \ general case, there will be some indication of\n   which MTAs (if any) handled\
    \ the message after the addition of the\n   header field defined here.\n"

  - "7.4.  Reverse IP Query Denial-of-Service Attacks\n   Section 5.5 of [SPF] describes\
    \ a DNS-based denial-of-service attack\n   for verifiers that attempt DNS-based\

    \ to do this check and\n   report this information needs to take care not to go\
    \ to unbounded\n   lengths to resolve \"A\" and \"PTR\" queries.  MUAs or other\
    \ filters\n   making use of an \"iprev\" result specified by this document need\

  - "7.6.  Internal MTA Lists\n   Section 5 describes a procedure for scrubbing header\

    \ A compliant\n   installation will have to include, at each MTA, a list of other\
    \ MTAs\n   known to be compliant and trustworthy.  Failing to keep this list\n\
    \   current as internal infrastructure changes may expose an ADMD to\n   attack.\n"
- title: 7.7.  Attacks against Authentication Methods
  contents:
  - "7.7.  Attacks against Authentication Methods\n   If an attack becomes known against\
    \ an authentication method, clearly\n   then the agent verifying that method can\
    \ be fooled into thinking an\n   inauthentic message is authentic, and thus the\
    \ value of this header\n   field can be misleading.  It follows that any attack\
    \ against the\n   authentication methods supported by this document is also a\
    \ security\n   consideration here.\n"
- title: 7.8.  Intentionally Malformed Header Fields
  contents:
  - "7.8.  Intentionally Malformed Header Fields\n   It is possible for an attacker\
    \ to add an Authentication-Results\n   header field that is extraordinarily large\
    \ or otherwise malformed in\n   an attempt to discover or exploit weaknesses in\
    \ header field parsing\n   code.  Implementers must thoroughly verify all such\
    \ header fields\n   received from MTAs and be robust against intentionally as\
    \ well as\n   unintentionally malformed header fields.\n"
- title: 7.9.  Compromised Internal Hosts
  contents:
  - "7.9.  Compromised Internal Hosts\n   An internal MUA or MTA that has been compromised\
    \ could generate mail\n   with a forged From header field and a forged Authentication-Results\n\
    \   header field that endorses it.  Although it is clearly a larger\n   concern\
    \ to have compromised internal machines than it is to prove the\n   value of this\
    \ header field, this risk can be mitigated by arranging\n   that internal MTAs\
    \ will remove this header field if it claims to have\n   been added by a trusted\
    \ border MTA (as described above), yet the\n   [SMTP] connection is not coming\
    \ from an internal machine known to be\n   running an authorized MTA.  However,\
    \ in such a configuration,\n   legitimate MTAs will have to add this header field\
    \ when legitimate\n   internal-only messages are generated.  This is also covered\
    \ in\n   Section 5.\n"
- title: 7.10.  Encapsulated Instances
  contents:
  - "7.10.  Encapsulated Instances\n   MIME messages can contain attachments of type\
    \ \"message/rfc822\", which\n   contain other messages.  Such an encapsulated\
    \ message can also\n   contain an Authentication-Results header field.  Although\
    \ the\n   processing of these is outside of the intended scope of this document\n\
    \   (see Section 1.3), some early guidance to MUA developers is\n   appropriate\
    \ here.\n   Since MTAs are unlikely to strip Authentication-Results header fields\n\
    \   after mailbox delivery, MUAs are advised in Section 4.1 to ignore\n   such\
    \ instances within MIME attachments.  Moreover, when extracting a\n   message\
    \ digest to separate mail store messages or other media, such\n   header fields\
    \ should be removed so that they will never be\n   interpreted improperly by MUAs\
    \ that might later consume them.\n"

- title: Appendix B.  Legacy MUAs
  contents:
  - "Appendix B.  Legacy MUAs\n   Implementers of this protocol should be aware that\
    \ many MUAs are\n   unlikely to be retrofitted to support the new header field\
    \ and its\n   semantics.  In the interests of convenience and quicker adoption,\
    \ a\n   delivery MTA might want to consider adding things that are processed\n\
    \   by existing MUAs in addition to the Authentication-Results header\n   field.\
    \  One suggestion is to include a Priority header field, on\n   messages that\
    \ don't already have such a header field, containing a\n   value that reflects\
    \ the strength of the authentication that was\n   accomplished, e.g., \"low\"\
    \ for weak or no authentication, \"normal\" or\n   \"high\" for good or strong\
    \ authentication.\n   Some modern MUAs can already filter based on the content\
    \ of this\n   header field.  However, there is keen interest in having MUAs make\n\
    \   some kind of graphical representation of this header field's meaning\n   to\
    \ end users.  Until this capability is added, other interim means of\n   conveying\
    \ authentication results may be necessary while this proposal\n   and its successors\

    \ Once again, the authserv-id used\n   is the recipient's DNS domain name.  The\
    \ header field is present\n   twice because two different MTAs in the chain of\
    \ delivery did\n   authentication tests.  The first MTA, mail-router.example.com,\n\
    \   reports that SMTP AUTH and SPF were both used and that the former\n   passed\
    \ while the latter failed.  In the SMTP AUTH case, additional\n   information\
    \ is provided in the comment field, which the MUA can\n   choose to render if\
    \ desired.\n   The second MTA, auth-checker.example.com, reports that it did a\n\
    \   Sender ID test (which failed) and a DKIM test (which passed).  Again,\n  \
    \ additional data about one of the tests is provided as a comment,\n   which the\
    \ MUA may choose to render.  Also noteworthy here is the fact\n   that there is\
    \ a DKIM signature added by example.com that assured the\n   integrity of the\
    \ lower Authentication-Results field.\n   Since different hosts did the two sets\
    \ of authentication checks, the\n   header fields cannot be consolidated in this\
    \ example.\n   This example illustrates more typical transmission of mail into\n\
    \   example.com from a user on a dialup connection example.net.  The user\n  \
    \ appears to be legitimate as he/she had a valid password allowing\n   authentication\
    \ at the border MTA using SMTP AUTH.  The SPF and Sender\n   ID tests failed since\
    \ example.com has not granted example.net\n   authority to relay mail on its behalf.\
    \  However, the DKIM test passed\n   because the sending user had a private key\
    \ matching one of\n   example.com's published public keys and used it to sign\
    \ the message.\n"

    \                            in Different ADMDs\n   In this example, we see multi-tiered\
    \ authentication with an extended\n   trust boundary.\n   The message was sent\
    \ from someone at example.com's New York office\n   (newyork.example.com) to a\
    \ mailing list managed at an intermediary.\n   The message was signed at the origin\
    \ using DKIM.\n   The message was sent to a mailing list service provider called\n\
    \   example.net, which is used by example.com.  There,\n   meetings@example.net\
    \ is expanded to a long list of recipients, one of\n   whom is at the Chicago\
    \ office.  In this example, we will assume that\n   the trust boundary for chicago.example.com\
    \ includes the mailing list\n   server at example.net.\n   The mailing list server\
    \ there first authenticated the message and\n   affixed an Authentication-Results\
    \ header field indicating such using\n   its DNS domain name for the authserv-id.\
    \  It then altered the message\n   by affixing some footer text to the body, including\
    \ some\n   administrivia such as unsubscription instructions.  Finally, the\n\
    \   mailing list server affixes a second DKIM signature and begins\n   distribution\
    \ of the message.\n   The border MTA for chicago.example.com explicitly trusts\
    \ results from\n   mail-router.example.net, so that header field is not removed.\
    \  It\n   performs evaluation of both signatures and determines that the first\n\
    \   (most recent) is a \"pass\" but, because of the aforementioned\n   modifications,\
    \ the second is a \"fail\".  However, the first signature\n   included the Authentication-Results\
    \ header added at mail-\n   router.example.net that validated the second signature.\
    \  Thus,\n   indirectly, it can be determined that the authentications claimed\
    \ by\n   both signatures are indeed valid.\n   Note that two styles of presenting\
    \ metadata about the result are in\n   use here.  In one case, the \"reason=\"\
    \ clause is present, which is\n   intended for easy extraction by parsers; in\
    \ the other case, the CFWS\n   production of the ABNF is used to include such\
    \ data as a header field\n   comment.  The latter can be harder for parsers to\
    \ extract given the\n   varied supported syntaxes of mail header fields.\n"

- title: Appendix D.  Operational Considerations about Message Authentication
  contents:
  - "Appendix D.  Operational Considerations about Message Authentication\n   This\
    \ protocol is predicated on the idea that authentication (and\n   presumably in\
    \ the future, reputation) work is typically done by\n   border MTAs rather than\
    \ MUAs or intermediate MTAs; the latter merely\n   make use of the results determined\
    \ by the former.  Certainly this is\n   not mandatory for participation in electronic\
    \ mail or message\n   authentication, but this protocol and its deployment to\
    \ date are\n   based on that model.  The assumption satisfies several common ADMD\n\
    \   requirements:\n   1.  Service operators prefer to resolve the handling of\
    \ problem\n       messages as close to the border of the ADMD as possible.  This\n\
    \       enables, for example, rejection of messages at the SMTP level\n      \
    \ rather than generating a DSN internally.  Thus, doing any of the\n       authentication\
    \ or reputation work exclusively at the MUA or\n       intermediate MTA renders\
    \ this desire unattainable.\n   2.  Border MTAs are more likely to have direct\
    \ access to external\n       sources of authentication or reputation information\
    \ since modern\n       MUAs are more likely to be heavily firewalled.  Thus, some\
    \ MUAs\n       might not even be able to complete the task of performing\n   \
    \    authentication or reputation evaluations without complex proxy\n       configurations\
    \ or similar burdens.\n   3.  MUAs rely upon the upstream MTAs within their trust\
    \ boundaries to\n       make correct (as much as is possible) evaluations about\
    \ the\n       message's envelope, header, and content.  Thus, MUAs don't need\n\
    \       to know how to do the work that upstream MTAs do; they only need\n   \
    \    the results of that work.\n   4.  Evaluations about the quality of a message,\
    \ from simple token\n       matching (e.g., a list of preferred DNS domains) to\
    \ cryptanalysis\n       (e.g., public/private key work), are at least a little\
    \ bit\n       expensive and thus need to be minimized.  To that end, performing\n\
    \       those tests at the border MTA is far preferred to doing that work\n  \
    \     at each MUA that handles a message.  If an ADMD's environment\n       adheres\
    \ to common messaging protocols, a reputation query or an\n       authentication\
    \ check performed by a border MTA would return the\n       same result as the\
    \ same query performed by an MUA.  By contrast,\n       in an environment where\
    \ the MUA does the work, a message arriving\n       for multiple recipients would\
    \ thus cause authentication or\n       reputation evaluation to be done more than\
    \ once for the same\n       message (i.e., at each MUA), causing needless amplification\
    \ of\n       resource use and creating a possible denial-of-service attack\n \
    \      vector.\n   5.  Minimizing change is good.  As new authentication and reputation\n\
    \       methods emerge, the list of methods supported by this header\n       field\
    \ would presumably be extended.  If MUAs simply consume the\n       contents of\
    \ this header field rather than actually attempt to do\n       authentication\
    \ and/or reputation work, then MUAs only need to\n       learn to parse this header\
    \ field once; emergence of new methods\n       requires only a configuration change\
    \ at the MUAs and software\n       changes at the MTAs (which are presumably fewer\
    \ in number).  When\n       choosing to implement these functions in MTAs vs.\
    \ MUAs, the\n       issues of individual flexibility, infrastructure inertia,\
    \ and\n       scale of effort must be considered.  It is typically easier to\n\
    \       change a single MUA than an MTA because the modification affects\n   \
    \    fewer users and can be pursued with less care.  However, changing\n     \
    \  many MUAs is more effort than changing a smaller number of MTAs.\n   6.  For\
    \ decisions affecting message delivery and display, assessment\n       based on\
    \ authentication and reputation is best performed close to\n       the time of\
    \ message transit, as a message makes its journey\n       toward a user's inbox,\
    \ not afterwards.  DKIM keys and IP address\n       reputations, etc., can change\
    \ over time or even become invalid,\n       and users can take a long time to\
    \ read a message once delivered.\n       The value of this work thus degrades,\
    \ perhaps quickly, once the\n       delivery process has completed.  This seriously\
    \ diminishes the\n       value of this work when done other than at MTAs.\n  \
    \ Many operational choices are possible within an ADMD, including the\n   venue\
    \ for performing authentication and/or reputation assessment.\n   The current\
    \ specification does not dictate any of those choices.\n   Rather, it facilitates\
    \ those cases in which information produced by\n   one stage of analysis needs\
    \ to be transported with the message to the\n   next stage.\n"
