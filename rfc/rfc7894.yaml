- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   \"PKCS #9: Selected Object Classes and Attribute Types Version\
    \ 2.0\"\n   [RFC2985] defined a challengePassword attribute that has been\n  \
    \ overloaded by modern protocol usage with the appropriate\n   interpretation\
    \ being provided by context rather than OID definition.\n   PKCS #9 defines the\
    \ challengePassword attribute as \"a password by\n   which an entity may request\
    \ certificate revocation\".  The parsing and\n   embedding of this attribute within\
    \ Certificate Signing Requests is\n   well supported by common PKI toolsets, but\
    \ many workflows leverage\n   this supported field as a one-time password for\
    \ authentication.  For\n   example, this is codified in many Simple Certificate\
    \ Enrollment\n   Protocol (SCEP) implementations as indicated by [SCEP].  Continuing\n\
    \   this trend, Enrollment over Secure Transport (EST) [RFC7030] defines\n   an\
    \ additional semantic for the challengePassword attribute in\n   Section 3.5,\
    \ in order to provide a linking of the Certificate Signing\n   Request (CSR) to\
    \ the secure transport.\n   Where the context of the protocol operation fully\
    \ defined the proper\n   semantic, and when only one use was required at a time,\
    \ the\n   overloading of this field did not cause difficulties.  Implementation\n\
    \   experience with EST has shown this to be a limitation though.  There\n   are\
    \ plausible use cases where it is valuable to use either of the\n   existing methods\
    \ separately or in concert.  For example, an EST\n   server might require the\
    \ client to authenticate itself using the\n   existing client X.509 certificate\
    \ as well as the user's username and\n   password, and to include a one-time password\
    \ within the CSR, all\n   while maintaining identity linking to bind the CSR to\
    \ the secure\n   transport.  The overloading of a single attribute type should\
    \ not be\n   the limiting factor for administrators attempting to meet their\n\
    \   security requirements.\n   This document defines the otpChallenge attribute\
    \ for use when a one-\n   time password (OTP) value within the CSR is a requirement.\
    \  The\n   revocationChallenge attribute is defined to allow disambiguated usage\n\
    \   of the original challenge password attribute semantics for\n   certificate\
    \ revocation.  The estIdentityLinking attribute is defined\n   to reference existing\
    \ EST challenge password semantics with no\n   potential for confusion with legacy\
    \ challenge password practices.\n   The attributes defined in this specification\
    \ supplement existing EST\n   mechanisms and are not intended to displace current\
    \ usage of any\n   existing EST authentication mechanisms.  Conveying the authentication\n\
    \   value itself as an attribute may be preferable to using an HTTP or\n   Transport\
    \ Layer Security (TLS) password or other TLS authentication\n   mechanism in environments\
    \ where the certificate request processing\n   component is removed from the HTTP/TLS\
    \ termination point, for\n   example, when a web application firewall is used.\n"

- title: 3.  Alternative Challenge Password Attributes
  contents:
  - "3.  Alternative Challenge Password Attributes\n   The following sections describe\
    \ three alternative challenge password\n   attributes for use with EST [RFC7030].\
    \  Appendix A provides an ASN.1\n   module containing the new definitions.\n \
    \  Each attribute described below is defined as a DirectoryString with a\n   maximum\
    \ length of 255, which features several possible encoding\n   options.  Attribute\
    \ values generated in accordance this document\n   SHOULD use the PrintableString\
    \ encoding whenever possible.  If\n   internationalization issues make this impossible,\
    \ the UTF8String\n   alternative SHOULD be used.  Attribute processing systems\
    \ MUST be\n   able to recognize and process the PrintableString and UTF8String\n\
    \   string types in DirectoryString values.  Support for other string\n   types\
    \ is OPTIONAL.\n"

  contents:
  - "3.1.  OTP Challenge Attribute\n   The otpChallenge attribute is defined as a\
    \ DirectoryString with a\n   maximum length of 255.  This is consistent with the\
    \ challengePassword\n   attribute as originally defined in PKCS #9 [RFC2985].\
    \  The\n   otpChallenge attribute is identified by the id-aa-otpChallenge object\n\
    \   identifier.  This facilitates reuse of the existing challengePassword\n  \
    \ code by associating the new object identifiers with the existing\n   parsing\
    \ and generation code.  This attribute provides a means of\n   conveying a one-time\
    \ password value as part of a CSR request.\n   Generation, verification, storage,\
    \ etc., of the value is not\n   addressed by this specification.  [RFC4226] and\

- title: 3.2.  Revocation Challenge Attribute
  contents:
  - "3.2.  Revocation Challenge Attribute\n   The original PKCS #9 challengePassword\
    \ field has been overloaded, and\n   the common use is unclear.  The revocationChallenge\
    \ attribute defined\n   here provides an unambiguous method of indicating the\

- title: 4.  Indicating Support for the Alternative Challenge Attributes
  contents:
  - "4.  Indicating Support for the Alternative Challenge Attributes\n   The EST server\
    \ MUST indicate these attributes, as the particular use\n   case requires, in\
    \ every CSR Attributes Response.  An EST server MAY\n   send both the estIdentityLinking\
    \ attribute and the challengePassword\n   attribute [RFC7030] in a CSR Attributes\
    \ Response to ensure support\n   for legacy clients.\n   The client MUST include\
    \ every indicated attribute for which it has\n   values in the subsequent CSR.\
    \  If a client sees an estIdentityLinking\n   attribute in a CSR Attributes Response,\
    \ it SHOULD prefer that and not\n   include a challengePassword attribute [RFC7030]\
    \ in the resulting CSR.\n   EST clients that include an unsolicited estIdentityLinking\
    \ attribute\n   MAY also include the challengePassword attribute [RFC7030] to\
    \ ensure\n   support for legacy servers.\n   EST servers MUST evaluate each challenge\
    \ attribute independently.\n   All challenge attributes included by an EST client\
    \ MUST be\n   successfully processed by an EST server for a request to be\n  \
    \ considered valid.  The EST server MAY ignore challenge attributes\n   according\
    \ to local policy, for example, if the EST client is an\n   authenticated Registration\
    \ Authority, the EST server may ignore the\n   estIdentityLinking attribute within\
    \ a CSR (see Section 3.7 of\n   [RFC7030]).  The EST server MAY refuse enrollment\
    \ requests that are\n   not encoded according to the policy of the Certification\
    \ Authority\n   (CA).\n"

  contents:
  - "5.  Security Considerations\n   In addition to the security considerations expressed\
    \ in the EST\n   specification [RFC7030], additional security considerations may\
    \ be\n   associated with the mechanism used to generate and verify the\n   otpChallenge\
    \ value.  Where a one-time password is used, the security\n   considerations expressed\
    \ in \"HOTP: An HMAC-Based One-Time Password\n   Algorithm\" [RFC4226] or \"TOTP:\
    \ Time-Based One-Time Password\n   Algorithm\" [RFC6238] may be relevant.  Similarly,\
