  - "1 Introduction\n   A \"security incident\" as defined in [RFC2828] is a security-relevant\n\
    \   system event in which the system's security policy is disobeyed or\n   otherwise\
    \ breached.  The purpose of this document is to provide\n   System Administrators\
    \ with guidelines on the collection and archiving\n   of evidence relevant to\
    \ such a security incident.  It's not our\n   intention to insist that all System\
    \ Administrators rigidly follow\n   these guidelines every time they have a security\
    \ incident.  Rather,\n   we want to provide guidance on what they should do if\
    \ they elect to\n   collect and protect information relating to an intrusion.\n\
    \   Such collection represents a considerable effort on the part of the\n   System\
    \ Administrator.  Great progress has been made in recent years\n   to speed up\
    \ the re-installation of the Operating System and to\n   facilitate the reversion\
    \ of a system to a 'known' state, thus making\n   the 'easy option' even more\
    \ attractive.  Meanwhile little has been\n   done to provide easy ways of archiving\
    \ evidence (the difficult\n   option).  Further, increasing disk and memory capacities\
    \ and the more\n   widespread use of stealth and cover-your-tracks tactics by\
    \ attackers\n   have exacerbated the problem.\n   If evidence collection is done\
    \ correctly, it is much more useful in\n   apprehending the attacker, and stands\
    \ a much greater chance of being\n   admissible in the event of a prosecution.\n\
    \   You should use these guidelines as a basis for formulating your\n   site's\
    \ evidence collection procedures, and should incorporate your\n   site's procedures\
    \ into your Incident Handling documentation.  The\n   guidelines in this document\
    \ may not be appropriate under all\n   jurisdictions.  Once you've formulated\
    \ your site's evidence\n   collection procedures, you should have law enforcement\
    \ for your\n   jurisdiction confirm that they're adequate.\n"

- title: 2 Guiding Principles during Evidence Collection
  contents:
  - "2 Guiding Principles during Evidence Collection\n      -  Adhere to your site's\
    \ Security Policy and engage the\n         appropriate Incident Handling and Law\
    \ Enforcement personnel.\n      -  Capture as accurate a picture of the system\
    \ as possible.\n      -  Keep detailed notes.  These should include dates and\
    \ times.  If\n         possible generate an automatic transcript.  (e.g., On Unix\n\
    \         systems the 'script' program can be used, however the output\n     \
    \    file it generates should not be to media that is part of the\n         evidence).\
    \  Notes and print-outs should be signed and dated.\n      -  Note the difference\
    \ between the system clock and UTC.  For each\n         timestamp provided, indicate\
    \ whether UTC or local time is used.\n      -  Be prepared to testify (perhaps\
    \ years later) outlining all\n         actions you took and at what times.  Detailed\
    \ notes will be\n         vital.\n      -  Minimise changes to the data as you\
    \ are collecting it.  This is\n         not limited to content changes; you should\
    \ avoid updating file\n         or directory access times.\n      -  Remove external\
    \ avenues for change.\n      -  When confronted with a choice between collection\
    \ and analysis\n         you should do collection first and analysis later.\n\
    \      -  Though it hardly needs stating, your procedures should be\n        \
    \ implementable.  As with any aspect of an incident response\n         policy,\
    \ procedures should be tested to ensure feasibility,\n         particularly in\
    \ a crisis.  If possible procedures should be\n         automated for reasons\
    \ of speed and accuracy.  Be methodical.\n      -  For each device, a methodical\
    \ approach should be adopted which\n         follows the guidelines laid down\
    \ in your collection procedure.\n         Speed will often be critical so where\
    \ there are a number of\n         devices requiring examination it may be appropriate\
    \ to spread\n         the work among your team to collect the evidence in parallel.\n\
    \         However on a single given system collection should be done step\n  \
    \       by step.\n      -  Proceed from the volatile to the less volatile (see\
    \ the Order\n         of Volatility below).\n      -  You should make a bit-level\
    \ copy of the system's media.  If you\n         wish to do forensics analysis\
    \ you should make a bit-level copy\n         of your evidence copy for that purpose,\
    \ as your analysis will\n         almost certainly alter file access times.  Avoid\
    \ doing\n         forensics on the evidence copy.\n"
- title: 2.1 Order of Volatility
  contents:
  - "2.1 Order of Volatility\n   When collecting evidence you should proceed from\
    \ the volatile to the\n   less volatile.  Here is an example order of volatility\
    \ for a typical\n   system.\n      -  registers, cache\n      -  routing table,\
    \ arp cache, process table, kernel statistics,\n         memory\n      -  temporary\
    \ file systems\n      -  disk\n      -  remote logging and monitoring data that\
    \ is relevant to the\n         system in question\n      -  physical configuration,\
    \ network topology\n      -  archival media\n"
- title: 2.2 Things to avoid
  contents:
  - "2.2 Things to avoid\n   It's all too easy to destroy evidence, however inadvertently.\n\
    \      -  Don't shutdown until you've completed evidence collection.\n       \
    \  Much evidence may be lost and the attacker may have altered the\n         startup/shutdown\
    \ scripts/services to destroy evidence.\n      -  Don't trust the programs on\
    \ the system.  Run your evidence\n         gathering programs from appropriately\
    \ protected media (see\n         below).\n      -  Don't run programs that modify\
    \ the access time of all files on\n         the system (e.g., 'tar' or 'xcopy').\n\
    \      -  When removing external avenues for change note that simply\n       \
    \  disconnecting or filtering from the network may trigger\n         \"deadman\
    \ switches\" that detect when they're off the net and\n         wipe evidence.\n"
- title: 2.3 Privacy Considerations
  contents:
  - "2.3 Privacy Considerations\n      -  Respect the privacy rules and guidelines\
    \ of your company and\n         your legal jurisdiction.  In particular, make\
    \ sure no\n         information collected along with the evidence you are searching\n\
    \         for is available to anyone who would not normally have access\n    \
    \     to this information.  This includes access to log files (which\n       \
    \  may reveal patterns of user behaviour) as well as personal data\n         files.\n\
    \      -  Do not intrude on people's privacy without strong\n         justification.\
    \  In particular, do not collect information from\n         areas you do not normally\
    \ have reason to access (such as\n         personal file stores) unless you have\
    \ sufficient indication\n         that there is a real incident.\n      -  Make\
    \ sure you have the backing of your company's established\n         procedures\
    \ in taking the steps you do to collect evidence of an\n         incident.\n"
- title: 2.4 Legal Considerations
  contents:
  - "2.4 Legal Considerations\n   Computer evidence needs to be\n      -  Admissible:\
    \  It must conform to certain legal rules before it\n         can be put before\
    \ a court.\n      -  Authentic:  It must be possible to positively tie evidentiary\n\
    \         material to the incident.\n      -  Complete:  It must tell the whole\
    \ story and not just a\n         particular perspective.\n      -  Reliable: \
    \ There must be nothing about how the evidence was\n         collected and subsequently\
    \ handled that casts doubt about its\n         authenticity and veracity.\n  \
    \    -  Believable:  It must be readily believable and understandable\n      \
    \   by a court.\n"
- title: 3 The Collection Procedure
  contents:
  - "3 The Collection Procedure\n   Your collection procedures should be as detailed\
    \ as possible.  As is\n   the case with your overall Incident Handling procedures,\
    \ they should\n   be unambiguous, and should minimise the amount of decision-making\n\
    \   needed during the collection process.\n"
- title: 3.1 Transparency
  contents:
  - "3.1 Transparency\n   The methods used to collect evidence should be transparent\
    \ and\n   reproducible.  You should be prepared to reproduce precisely the\n \
    \  methods you used, and have those methods tested by independent\n   experts.\n"
- title: 3.2 Collection Steps
  contents:
  - "3.2 Collection Steps\n      -  Where is the evidence?  List what systems were\
    \ involved in the\n         incident and from which evidence will be collected.\n\
    \      -  Establish what is likely to be relevant and admissible.  When\n    \
    \     in doubt err on the side of collecting too much rather than not\n      \
    \   enough.\n      -  For each system, obtain the relevant order of volatility.\n\
    \      -  Remove external avenues for change.\n      -  Following the order of\
    \ volatility, collect the evidence with\n         tools as discussed in Section\
    \ 5.\n      -  Record the extent of the system's clock drift.\n      -  Question\
    \ what else may be evidence as you work through the\n         collection steps.\n\
    \      -  Document each step.\n      -  Don't forget the people involved.  Make\
    \ notes of who was there\n         and what were they doing, what they observed\
    \ and how they\n         reacted.\n   Where feasible you should consider generating\
    \ checksums and\n   cryptographically signing the collected evidence, as this\
    \ may make it\n   easier to preserve a strong chain of evidence.  In doing so\
    \ you must\n   not alter the evidence.\n"
- title: 4 The Archiving Procedure
  contents:
  - "4 The Archiving Procedure\n   Evidence must be strictly secured.  In addition,\
    \ the Chain of Custody\n   needs to be clearly documented.\n"
- title: 4.1 Chain of Custody
  contents:
  - "4.1 Chain of Custody\n   You should be able to clearly describe how the evidence\
    \ was found,\n   how it was handled and everything that happened to it.\n   The\
    \ following need to be documented\n      -  Where, when, and by whom was the evidence\
    \ discovered and\n         collected.\n      -  Where, when and by whom was the\
    \ evidence handled or examined.\n      -  Who had custody of the evidence, during\
    \ what period.  How was\n         it stored.\n      -  When the evidence changed\
    \ custody, when and how did the\n         transfer occur (include shipping numbers,\
    \ etc.).\n"
- title: 4.2 Where and how to Archive
  contents:
  - "4.2 Where and how to Archive\n   If possible commonly used media (rather than\
    \ some obscure storage\n   media) should be used for archiving.\n   Access to\
    \ evidence should be extremely restricted, and should be\n   clearly documented.\
    \  It should be possible to detect unauthorised\n   access.\n"
- title: 5 Tools you'll need
  contents:
  - "5 Tools you'll need\n   You should have the programs you need to do evidence\
    \ collection and\n   forensics on read-only media (e.g., a CD).  You should have\
    \ prepared\n   such a set of tools for each of the Operating Systems that you\
    \ manage\n   in advance of having to use it.\n   Your set of tools should include\
    \ the following:\n      -  a program for examining processes (e.g., 'ps').\n \
    \     -  programs for examining system state (e.g., 'showrev',\n         'ifconfig',\
    \ 'netstat', 'arp').\n      -  a program for doing bit-to-bit copies (e.g., 'dd',\
    \ 'SafeBack').\n      -  programs for generating checksums and signatures (e.g.,\n\
    \         'sha1sum', a checksum-enabled 'dd', 'SafeBack', 'pgp').\n      -  programs\
    \ for generating core images and for examining them\n         (e.g., 'gcore',\
    \ 'gdb').\n      -  scripts to automate evidence collection (e.g., The Coroner's\n\
    \         Toolkit [FAR1999]).\n   The programs in your set of tools should be\
    \ statically linked, and\n   should not require the use of any libraries other\
    \ than those on the\n   read-only media.  Even then, since modern rootkits may\
    \ be installed\n   through loadable kernel modules, you should consider that your\
    \ tools\n   might not be giving you a full picture of the system.\n   You should\
    \ be prepared to testify to the authenticity and reliability\n   of the tools\
    \ that you use.\n"
