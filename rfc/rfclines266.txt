NETWORK HOST STATUS This RFC reports on the status of most.
Network Hosts from October 26 to November 5.
(Massachusetts celebrated Armistice day on Monday, October 25.)
During these two weeks the general status of these hosts remained as it had been previously.
The table on the following page summarizes the daily information on host status for this period.
F 10/26 10/27 10/28 10/29 11/1
(Destination Host returned a CLS to the initial RFC.)
(Destination Host did not respond in any way to the initial RFC, although not dead.)
H   1/2 Open (Destination Host opened a connection but then either immediately closed it, or did not respond any further.)
(Destination Host opened a connection and was accessible to users.)
The UCLA IBM 360/91 currently has Remote Job Service (NETRJS), but has not implemented a full server Telnet System.
The BBN Terminal IMP is not equipped to test NETRJS;
however, we are assuming that receipt of the UCLA explanatory message indicates that NETRJS is also functioning.
