    protocol.\n   IAC DO SUPDUP\n      The sender of this  command REQUESTS that  the
    receiver use,  or\n      grants the receiver permission to use, the SUPDUP protocol.\n
    \  IAC DON'T\n      The sender of this command DEMANDS that the receiver not use
    the\n      SUPDUP protocol.\n"

  - "4.  Motivation for the option.\n   Since the publication of RFC 734,  I have
    been requested to  design\n   an option to  the TELNET  protocol to provide  for
    SUPDUP  service.\n   This option allows a host to  provide SUPDUP service on the
    \ normal\n   TELNET socket (27 octal) instead of 137 (octal) which is the normal\n
    \  SUPDUP ICP socket.\n"
  title: 4.  Motivation for the option.

  - "5.  Description of the option.\n   A user  TELNET  program which  wishes  to
    use  the  SUPDUP  display\n   protocol instead of the NVT terminal service should
    send an IAC  DO\n   SUPDUP.  If  the  server  is  willing to  use  the  SUPDUP
    \ display\n   protocol, it  should respond  with IAC  WILL SUPDUP;  otherwise
    \ it\n   should refuse with IAC WONT SUPDUP.\n   For hosts  which normally  provide
    \ SUPDUP terminal  services,  the\n   server can send IAC  WILL SUPDUP upon ICP
    \ which the user may  then\n   accept or refuse.\n   If the SUPDUP option is  in
    effect, no further TELNET  negotiations\n   are allowed.   They  are  meaningless,
    since  SUPDUP  has  its  own\n   facilities to perform  the functions that are
    needed.  Hence, octal\n   377 will become an ordinary transmitted character (in
    this case  an\n   invalid %TD code) instead of an IAC.\n   Following the mutual
    \ acceptance of the  SUPDUP option, the  SUPDUP\n   negotiation proceeds as described
    in RFC 734.\n"
