- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   Null Packets are neither sent nor acknowledged when not\
    \ received.\n   They are perfect in their simplicity and they are very true, as\
    \ they\n   extrapolate from the twelfth Truth of networking [RFC1925]:  there\
    \ is\n   *literally* nothing left to take away.\n   An early mention of the Null\
    \ Packet is attributed to Van Jacobson in\n   the context of TCP/IP Header Compression\
    \ [RFC1144].  Mind you, the\n   Null Packet is not created by compressing a packet\
    \ until it\n   disappears into nothingness.  Such a compression scheme might not\
    \ be\n   reversible; instead, Section 3.2.4 of [RFC1144] describes an explicit\n\
    \   lack of response as \"Nothing (a null packet) is returned\".\n   Many documents\
    \ attempt to define in-the-wire code points and protocol\n   identifiers (PIDs)\
    \ for a Null Packet [RFC4259] [RFC4571] [RFC5320].\n   However, such an exercise\
    \ is futile.  This memo postulates that a\n   Null Packet cannot have a PID, as\
    \ the existence of a protocol\n   construct or value would null the null; this\
    \ includes the inability\n   to use 0x0, 0x0000, or even 0x00000000, but excludes\
    \ the restriction\n   to use \"\" (see Section 2.1).\n   An IPv6 Next Header value\
    \ of 59 (No Next Header) (see Section 4.7 of\n   [RFC2460]) does not create a\
    \ Null Packet.\n"
- title: 2.  The Null Packet
  contents:
  - "2.  The Null Packet\n   The Null Packet is a zero-dimensional packet.  The Null\
    \ Packet exists\n   since it is non-self-contradictorily definable.\n"
- title: 2.1.  Formal Definition
  contents:
  - "2.1.  Formal Definition\n   [This section is intentionally left blank, see also\
    \ Section 0 of\n   [NULL].]\n"
- title: 2.2.  Faux Amis
  contents:
  - "2.2.  Faux Amis\n   Many experts naively confuse the Null Packet with an Imaginary\n\
    \   Packet, in a rationalization attempt when faced with the inability to\n  \
    \ prove the existence of the Null Packet.  For reference, an Imaginary\n   Packet\
    \ contains the IP Version of 4i or 6i.  However, protocol\n   purists are not\
    \ fooled and quickly plea with experts to get real.\n   The Null Packet's qualities\
    \ should not be confused with the bit-\n   bucket blackhole nature of the null\
    \ device, since the Null Packet\n   does not discard packets.  Confusion might\
    \ stem from the fact that\n   the behavior is similar to that of input streams\
    \ reading from /dev/\n   null (i.e., \"nothing is returned\").\n"
- title: 3.  Performance Metrics Considerations
  contents:
  - "3.  Performance Metrics Considerations\n   A protocol sending Null Packets effectively\
    \ sends packets of zero\n   length.  One characteristic of flow streams of Null\
    \ Packet traffic is\n   that increasing the rate at which Null Packets are sent\
    \ does not\n   increase the bit rate of the Null Packet traffic.  The bit rate\n\
    \   continues being unequivocally null, unless an infinite number of Null\n  \
    \ Packets per unit of time could be sent.  Similarly, should a user\n   stop sending\
    \ Null Packets, the bit rate of Null Packets would not\n   vary.  Traditional\
    \ traffic performance metrics are not well suited to\n   qualify Null Packet traffic;\
    \ this fact argues for the creation of new\n   sets of performance metrics that\
    \ test positive for \"usefulness\" (see\n   Section 5.2 of [RFC6390]).\n"
- title: 4.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "4.  Security Considerations\n   When used in a Multiprotocol Label Switching\
    \ (MPLS) environment, the\n   Null Packet can only use an Implicit NULL label\
    \ (see Section 4.1.5 of\n   [RFC3031].  The Implicit NULL label is a label that\
    \ can be\n   distributed, but which never actually appears in the encapsulation.\n\
    \   The Nil FEC is not used.\n   The security considerations for the Null Packet\
    \ are undefined, as\n   hereby described.  The \"good\" nature of Null Packets\
    \ is quite\n   useless, and the \"bad\" nature of Null Packets is rather inefficient.\n"
- title: 4.1.  The Paradoxical Firewall
  contents:
  - "4.1.  The Paradoxical Firewall\n   Many firewalls and other security devices\
    \ have trouble identifying\n   the Null Packet.  Others claim to filter out Null\
    \ Packets quite\n   effectively and effortlessly.  Interestingly, or not, both\
    \ might be\n   correct, which begs the omnipotence paradox:  Can a firewall create\
    \ a\n   rule to filter out the Null Packet coming from the \"outside\", and not\n\
    \   see Null Packets being allowed on the \"inside\"?\n"
- title: 4.2.  The Null Packet is Good
  contents:
  - "4.2.  The Null Packet is Good\n   The Null Packet cannot have the Evil Bit (\"\
    E\") [RFC3514] set, by\n   definition (see Section 2.1).  Consequently, it is\
    \ rather clear and\n   undeniable that the Null Packet is harmless, having no\
    \ evil intent.\n"
- title: 4.3.  Just Encrypt It, Carefully
  contents:
  - "4.3.  Just Encrypt It, Carefully\n   A commonly accepted practice for Security\
    \ Considerations sections is\n   to wrap a blanket \"encrypt around foo\" statement,\
    \ for almost any\n   value of \"foo\".  This document is no exception.  However,\
    \ surgical\n   care must be taken to not apply NULL encryption [RFC2410] to the\
    \ Null\n   Packet; such a careless act can bring discontinuities and \"Oops\"\
    \ more\n   epic than dividing by zero or Googling the word \"Google\" (it has\
    \ been\n   rumored that such action can break the Internet, although this can\
    \ be\n   easily disproved by reductio ad absurdum.)\n"
- title: 4.4.  Denial of Denial of Service
  contents:
  - "4.4.  Denial of Denial of Service\n   Even when sysadmins, netadmins, secadmins,\
    \ and other NOC engineers\n   are faced with the undisputed inability to block\
    \ Null Packets (see\n   Section 4.1), attacks leveraging Null Packets are not\
    \ quite so common\n   in the wild and are not seen in the seek^Wsecurity news.\
    \  Perhaps\n   because these unusual packets are hard to spoof in the data plane,\
    \ or\n   because their Time to Live (TTL) or Hop Limit cannot be altered since\n\
    \   it does not exist [RFC5082], the fact is that Null Packets present a\n   denial\
    \ of denial of service (DoDoS).\n   An important corollary is that dropping Null\
    \ Packets does not\n   generate packets.\n"
