This Network Working Group Request for Comments documents the currently assigned values from several series of numbers used in network protocol implementations.
This RFC will be updated periodically, and in any case current information can be obtained from Joyce Reynolds.
The assignment of numbers is also handled by Joyce.
If you are developing a protocol or application that will require the use of a link, socket, port, protocol, network number, etc., please contact Joyce to receive a number assignment.

JKREYNOLDS@ISI.EDU Most of the protocols mentioned here are documented in the RFC series of notes.
Some of the items listed are undocumented.
Further information on protocols can be found in the memo "Official ARPA Internet Protocols" [114].
The more prominent and more generally used are documented in the "DDN Protocol Handbook" [46] prepared by the NIC.
Other collections of older or obsolete protocols are contained in the "Internet Protocol Transition Workbook [47], or in the "ARPANET Protocol Handbook" [48].
For further information on ordering the complete 1985 DDN Protocol Handbook, write:
SRI International, DDN Network Information Center, Room EJ291, 333 Ravenswood Avenue, Meno Park, California, 94025.
In the entries below the name and mailbox of the responsible individual is indicated.
The bracketed entry, e.g., [nn,iii], at the right hand margin of the page indicates a reference for the listed protocol, where the number ("nn") cites the document and the letters ("iii") cites the person.
Whenever possible, the letters are a NIC Ident as used in the WhoIs (NICNAME) service.
The convention in the documentation of Internet Protocols is to express numbers in decimal and to picture data in "big endian" order [131].
That is, fields are described left to right, with the most significant octet on the left and the least significant octet on the right.
The order of transmission of the header and data described in this document is resolved to the octet level.
Whenever a diagram shows a group of octets, the order of transmission of those octets is the normal order in which they are read in English.
For example, in the following diagram the octets are transmitted in the order they are numbered. 0
Whenever an octet represents a numeric quantity the left most bit in the diagram is the high order or most significant bit.
That is, the bit labeled 0 is the most significant bit.
For example, the following diagram represents the value 170 (decimal).
the left most bit of the whole field is the most significant bit.
When a multi octet quantity is transmitted the most significant octet is transmitted first.
Network Numbers ASSIGNED NETWORK NUMBERS
The network numbers listed here are used as internet addresses by the Internet Protocol (IP) [46,101].
The IP uses a 32 bit address field and divides that address into a network part and a "rest" or local address part.
The division takes 3 forms or classes.
The first type of address, or class A, has a 7 bit network number and a 24 bit local address.
The highest order bit is set to 0.
This allows 128 class A networks.
The second type of address, class B, has a 14 bit network number and a 16 bit local address.
The two highest order bits are set to 1 0.
This allows 16,384 class B networks.
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0
The third type of address, class C, has a 21 bit network number and a 8 bit local address.
The three highest order bits are set to 1 1 0.
This allows 2,097,152 class C networks.
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0
The fourth type of address, class D, is used as a multicast address [44].
The four highest order bits are set to 1 1 1 0.
No addresses are allowed with the four highest order bits set to 1 1 1 1.
These addresses, called "class E", are reserved.
One commonly used notation for internet host addresses divides the 32 bit address into four 8 bit fields and specifies the value of each field as a decimal number with the fields separated by periods.
This is called the "dotted decimal" notation.
For example, the internet address of B.ISI.EDU in dotted decimal is 010.003.000.052, or 10.3.0.52.
The dotted decimal notation will be used in the listing of assigned network numbers.
A networks will have nnn.rrr.rrr.rrr, the class B networks will have nnn.nnn.rrr.rrr, and the class C networks will have nnn.nnn.nnn.rrr, where nnn represents part or all of a network number and rrr represents part or all of a local address.
There are four catagories of users of Internet Addresses: Research, Defense, Government (Non Defense), and Commercial.
To reflect the allocation of network identifiers among the categories, a one character code is placed to the left of the network number: R for Research, D for Defense, G for Government, and C for Commercial (see Appendix A for further details on this division of the network identification).
Network numbers are assigned for networks that are connected to the ARPA Internet and DDN Internet, and for independent networks that use the IP family protocols (these are usually commercial).
These independent networks are marked with an asterisk preceding the number.
The administrators of independent networks must apply separately for permission to interconnect their network with either the ARPA Internet of the DDN Internet.
Independent networks should not be listed in the working tables of either the ARPA Internet or DDN Internet hosts or gateways.
For various reasons, the assigned numbers of networks are sometimes changed.
To ease the transition the old number will be listed for a transition period as well.
These "old number" entries will be marked with a "T" following the number and preceding the name, and the network name will be suffixed " TEMP".
: In certain contexts, it is useful to have fixed addresses with functional significance rather than as identifiers of specific hosts.
The address zero is to be interpreted as meaning "this", as in "this network".
For example, the address 0.0.0.37 could be interpreted as meaning host 37 on this network.
The address of all ones are to be interpreted as meaning "all", as in "all hosts".
For example, the address 128.9.255.255 could be interpreted as meaning all hosts on the network 128.9.
The class A network number 127 is assigned the "loopback" function, that is, a datagram sent by a higher level protocol to a network 127 address should loop back inside the host.
No datagram "sent" to a network 127 address should ever appear on any network anywhere.

[JBP] Other Reserved Internet Addresses
In the Internet Protocol (IP) [46,101] there is a field to identify the version of the internetwork general protocol.
This field is 4 bits in size.
Protocol Numbers ASSIGNED PROTOCOL NUMBERS
In the Internet Protocol (IP)
[46,101] there is a field, called Protocol, to identify the the next level protocol.
This is an 8 bit field.
PORT NUMBERS Ports are used in the TCP [46,102] to name the ends of logical connections which carry long term conversations.
For the purpose of providing services to unknown callers, a service contact port is defined.
This list specifies the port used by the server process as its contact port.
The contact port is sometimes called the "well known port".
To the extent possible, these same port assignments are used with the UDP [46,100].
To the extent possible, these same port assignments are used with the ISO TP4 [64].
The assigned ports use a small portion of the possible port numbers.
The assigned ports have all except the low order eight bits cleared to zero.
The low order eight bits are specified here.

Autonomous System Numbers ASSIGNED AUTONOMOUS SYSTEM
The Exterior Gateway Protocol (EGP) [115,118] specifies that groups of gateways may form autonomous systems.
The EGP provides a 16 bit field for identifying such systems.
The values of this field are registered here.
[RTL] 64  MITRE B AS
Autonomous System Numbers 83  PICANET
Domain System Parameters DOMAIN SYSTEM
The Internet Domain Naming System (DOMAIN) includes several parameters.
These are documented in RFC 883 [80].
The CLASS parameter is listed here.
The per CLASS parameters are defined in separate RFCs as indicated.
The ARPANET facility for "logical addressing" is described in RFC 878 [74].
A portion of the possible logical addresses are reserved for standard uses.
There are 49,152 possible logical host addresses.
Of these, 256 are reserved for assignment to well known functions.
Assignments for well known functions are made by Joyce Reynolds.
Assignments for other logical host addresses are made by the NIC.
ARPANET Link Numbers ASSIGNED ARPANET LINK
The word "link" here refers to a field in the original ARPANET Host/IMP interface leader.
The link was originally defined as an 8 bit field.
Later specifications defined this field as the "message id" with a length of 12 bits.
The name link now refers to the high order 8 bits of this 12 bit message id field.
The Host/IMP interface is defined in BBN Report 1822 [10].
The low order 4 bits of the message id field are called the sub link.
Unless explicitly specified otherwise for a particular protocol, there is no sender to receiver significance to the sub link.
The sender may use the sub link in any way he chooses (it is returned in the RFNM by the destination IMP), the receiver should ignore the sub link.
802 Numbers IEEE 802 NUMBERS OF INTEREST
Some of the networks of all classes are IEEE 802 Networks.
These systems may use a Link Service Access Point (LSAP) field in much the same way the ARPANET uses the "link" field, further, there is a extension of the LSAP header called the Sub Network Access Protocol (SNAP).
The IEEE likes to describe numbers in binary in bit transmission order, which is the opposite of the big endian order used throughout the Internet protocol documentation.
These numbers (and others) are assigned by the IEEE Standards Office.
The address is: IEEE Standards Office, 345 East 47th Street, New York, N.Y. 10017,
At an ad hoc special session on "IEEE 802 Networks and ARP" held during the TCP Vendors Workshop (August 1986), an approach to a consistent way to sent DOD IP datagrams and other IP related protocols on 802 networks was developed.
Due to some evolution of the IEEE 802.2 standards and the need to provide for a standard way to do additional DOD IP related protocols (such as Address Resolution Protocol (ARP)) on IEEE 802 networks, the following new policy is established, which will replace the old policy (see RFC 960 and RFC 948 [138]).
Numbers SNAP with an organization code indicating that the following 16 bits specify the Ethertype code (where IP   2048 (0800 hex), see Ethernet Numbers of Interest).
Dsap K1  Ssap K1  control
The values of K1 and K2 must be assigned by the IEEE.
There is already assigned a value of K1 that indicates that the 5 octet SNAP header follows.
There may be a value of K2 that is already assigned that indicates that the last two octets of the SNAP header holds the EtherType.
The total length of the SAP Header and the SNAP header is 8 octets, making the 802.2 protocol overhead come out on a nice octet boundary.
The IEEE like to talk about things in bit transmission order and specifies this value as 01010101.
In big endian order, as used in Internet specifications, this becomes 10101010 binary, or AA hex, or 170 decimal.
We believe that K2 is 0 (zero).
This must be further investigated.
As an interim measure use K2   0.
The use of the IP LSAP (K1   6) is to be phased out as quickly as possible.
Ethernet Numbers ETHERNET NUMBERS OF INTEREST
Many of the networks of all classes are Ethernets (10Mb) or Experimental Ethernets (3Mb).
These systems use a message "type" field in much the same way the ARPANET uses the "link" field.
If you need an Ethernet type number, contact the XEROX Corporation, 2300 Geng Road, Palo Alto, California 94303, ATTN:
[HGM] The standard for transmission of IP datagrams over Ethernets and Experimental Ethernets is specified in RFC 894 [99] and RFC 895 [85] respectively.
Ethernet 48 bit address blocks are now assigned by the IEEE Standards Office (see section "IEEE 802 Numbers of Interest").
Address Resolution Protocol ASSIGNED ADDRESS RESOLUTION PROTOCOL PARAMETERS
The Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) specified in RFC 826 [83] has several parameters.
The assigned values for these parameters are listed here.
Public Data Network Numbers ASSIGNED PUBLIC DATA NETWORK NUMBERS
One of the Internet Class A Networks is the international system of Public Data Networks.
This section lists the mapping between the Internet Addresses and the Public Data Network Addresses (X.121).
The numbers below are assigned for networks that are connected to the ARPA Internet and DDN Internet, and for independent networks.
These independent networks are marked with an asterisk preceding the number.
The standard for transmission of IP datagrams over the Public Data Network is specified in RFC 877 [68].
The Telnet Protocol has a number of options that may be negotiated.
These options are listed here.
"Official ARPA Internet Protocols" [114] provides more detailed information.

The network numbers in class A, B, and C network addresses are allocated among Research, Defense, Government (Non Defense) and Commercial uses.
Class A (highest order bit 0)
12286 Reserved Addresses: (0, 16383)
1572862 Reserved Addresses: (0, 2097151)
All addresses in this class are used for multicast addresses.
Class E (highest order bits 1 1 1 1)
All addresses in this class are reserved for future use.
Within the Research community, network identifiers will only be granted to applicants who show evidence that they are acquiring standard Bolt Beranek and Newman gateway software or have implemented or are acquiring a gateway meeting the Exterior Gateway Protocol requirements.
Acquisition of the Berkeley BSD 4.3 UNIX software might be considered evidence of the latter.
Experimental networks which later become operational need not be renumbered.
Rather, the identifiers could be moved from Research to Defense, Government or Commercial status.
Thus, network identifiers may change state among Research, Defense, Government and Commercial, but the number of identifiers allocated to each use must remain within the limits indicated above.
To make possible this fluid assignment, the network identifier spaces are not allocated by simple partition, but rather by specific assignment.
These assignments are shared by the four communities.
These assignments are shared by the four communities.
These assignments are shared by the four communities.
These assignments are shared by the four communities.
TCP, IP and Telnet Option Identifiers
These assignments are shared by the four communities.
Joyce Reynolds is the coordinator for all number assignments.
