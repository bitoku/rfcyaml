  - "Introduction\n   As the use of Internet covers more and more Chinese people in\
    \ the\n   world, the need has increased for the ability to send documents\n  \
    \ containing Chinese characters on the Internet.  The methods described\n   in\
    \ this document provide means of transporting existing Chinese\n   character sets\
    \ as well as leaving space for future extension.\n   This document describes two\
    \ encodings, ISO-2022-CN and\n   ISO-2022-CN-EXT.  These are designed with interoperability\
    \ in mind\n   and are encouraged in this document for current Chinese interchange;\n\
    \   they are 7-bit, support both simplified and traditional characters\n   using\
    \ both GB and CNS/Big5, and do not impose any unusual quoting\n   requirements\
    \ on ASCII characters.\n   As important related issues, this document gives detailed\n\
    \   descriptions of the two encodings CN-GB and CN-Big5, and a brief\n   description\
    \ of ISO/IEC 10646 [ISO-10646].  CN-GB and CN-Big5 are\n   currently used as the\
    \ internal codes for Chinese documents.\n   ISO-10646 is the universal multi-octet\
    \ character set defined by ISO;\n   we feel that in the future it may become the\
    \ preferred technology for\n   Chinese documents and electronic mail when it is\
    \ widely available.\n"

- title: 1.1.  Description
  contents:
  - "1.1.  Description\n   ISO-2022-CN is based on ISO 2022 [ISO-2022], similar to\
    \ earlier work\n   on ISO-2022-JP [RFC-1468] and ISO-2022-KR [RFC-1557] for the\
    \ Japanese\n   and Korean languages respectively.  It is 7-bit, and supports both\n\
    \   simplified Chinese characters using GB 2312-80 [GB-2312] and\n   traditional\
    \ Chinese characters using the first two planes of CNS\n   11643 [CNS-11643],\
    \ as well as ASCII [ASCII] characters.\n   ISO-2022-CN-EXT is a superset of ISO-2022-CN\
    \ that additionally\n   supports other GB character sets and planes of CNS 11643.\n\
    \   Since ISO-2022-CN and ISO-2022-CN-EXT are 7-bit encodings, they do\n   not\
    \ require the 8-bit SMTP extensions.  ISO-2022-CN supports all the\n   Chinese\
    \ characters that appear in Big5 [BIG5].\n"

  - "1.2.  ISO-2022-CN\n   The starting code of ISO-2022-CN is ASCII.  ASCII and Chinese\n\
    \   characters are distinguished by designations (ESC sequences) and\n   shift\
    \ functions.\n   Designations define the Chinese character sets used in the text.\n\
    \   There are three kinds of designations: SOdesignation, SS2designation\n   and\
    \ SS3designation.\n   The SOdesignation is in the form ESC $ ) <F>, where <F>\
    \ is the \"final\n   character\" assigned to the character set by ISO (refer to\
    \ the ISO\n   registry [ISOREG] for more details).  The SS2designation is in the\n\
    \   form ESC $ * <F>, and the SS3designation is in the form ESC $ + <F>.\n   A\
    \ designation overrides any previous designation for subsequent bytes\n   in the\
    \ text.\n   There are four kinds of shifts: SI, SO, SS2 and SS3.  Shift functions\n\
    \   specify how to interpret the subsequent bytes.\n   The shift SI (one byte\
    \ with hexadecimal value 0F) declares that\n   subsequent bytes are interpreted\
    \ in ASCII.\n   The shift SO (one byte with hexadecimal value 0E) declares that\n\
    \   subsequent bytes are interpreted in the character set defined by\n   SOdesignation.\n\
    \   The shift SS2 (two bytes with hexadecimal values 1B 4E) declares that\n  \
    \ the subsequent TWO bytes are interpreted in the character set defined\n   by\
    \ SS2designation, after which the previous interpretation (from SI\n   or SO)\
    \ is restored.\n   The shift SS3 (two bytes with hexadecimal values 1B 4F) declares\
    \ that\n   the subsequent TWO bytes are interpreted in the character set defined\n\
    \   by SS3designation, after which the previous interpretation (from SI\n   or\
    \ SO) is restored.\n   The escape sequences, shift functions and character sets\
    \ used in an\n   ISO-2022-CN text are as follows:\n    Character sets        \

    \                       appears\n   If there are any GB or CNS characters on a\

    \ displayed\n   correctly when scroll back in a window.  Also, there must be a\
    \ shift\n   to ASCII (SI) before the end of the line (i.e., before the CRLF).\
    \  In\n   other words, each line starts in ASCII, and ends in ASCII.\n      Example:\
    \ the hex sequence\n         1b 24 29 41 0e 3d 3b 3b 3b 1b 24 29 47 47 28 5f 50\
    \ 0f\n      represents the Chinese word for \"Interchange\" (jiao huan) twice;\n\
    \      the first time in simplified form using GB-2312 (the 3d 3b 3b 3b\n    \
    \  sequence above), and the second time in traditional form using\n      CNS-11643\
    \ (the 47 28 5f 50 sequence above).  The sequence 1b 24 29\n      41 is the SOdesignation\
    \ for GB-2312, the 0e is SO to switch to\n      Chinese from ASCII, the 1b 24\
    \ 29 47 is the SOdesignation for\n      CNS-11643 plane 1, and finally the 0f\
    \ is the SI to return to ASCII\n      at the end of the line.\n   The name given\
    \ to this character encoding is \"ISO-2022-CN\". This name\n   is intended to\
    \ be used as the \"charset\" parameter in MIME [MIME-1,\n   MIME-2] messages.\n\
    \      Content-Type: text/plain; charset=iso-2022-cn\n   The ISO-2022-CN encoding\
    \ is already in 7-bit form, so it is not\n   necessary to use a Content-Transfer-Encoding\
    \ header.\n   Other restrictions are given in the \"Formal Syntax of ISO-2022-CN\"\

    \ way:\n   Big5 is used with ASCII.  The MSB of ASCII characters is always 0.\n\
    \   The MSB of the first byte of a Big5 character is always 1; this\n   distinguishes\

    \ CN-Big5 is an 8-bit encoding with a\n   15-bit codespace.\n   To use this character\

- title: 4.1.  "charset-edition"
  contents:
  - "4.1.  \"charset-edition\"\n   This parameter is used after the MIME \"charset\"\
    \ parameter, using four\n   digits (AD) to indicate what the year of edition is\
    \ for the character\n   set standard shown in \"charset\".  Its use is optional.\n\
    \   Implementations should ignore this parameter unless the\n   implementation\
    \ has specific support for that particular character set\n   edition.\n   The\
    \ reason for defining this parameter is that there are often\n   differences in\
    \ the defined characters between editions of a character\n   set standard.  Sometimes,\
    \ the difference can not be ignored,\n   otherwise implementations would have\
    \ problems when processing it.\n   There are only two ways to indicate this difference,\
    \ in the current\n   MIME syntax.  One way is to indicate the edition in the charset\
    \ name,\n   such as CN-GB-1988-80 (the 1980's edition of GB 1988).  The other\
    \ way\n   is to define a new optional parameter such as \"charset-edition\". \
    \ The\n   latter way is better because receiving applications that can only\n\
    \   process an older edition can still recognize the character set and\n   offer\
    \ to display the text in the older edition.  This display may\n   have a few mistakes,\
    \ but it is better than refusing to display any\n   text at all or defaulting\
    \ to an inappropriate character set such as\n   US-ASCII or ISO-8859-1.\n"
- title: 4.2.  "charset-extension"
  contents:
  - "4.2.  \"charset-extension\"\n   This parameter is also used after the MIME \"\
    charset\" parameter.  It\n   is case-insensitive and optional, and any value of\
    \ this parameter\n   should be registered in IANA.  Unregistered value should\
    \ start with\n   \"x-\" as with any MIME extension-token.  Implementations should\
    \ ignore\n   this parameter unless the implementation has specific support for\n\
    \   that particular character set extension.\n   A character set extension has\
    \ displayed glyphs for code points that\n   are not assigned in the character\
    \ set, for example, vendor-specific\n   extensions of standard character sets.\
    \  This parameter provides the\n   option of using these extensions.  Although\
    \ character set extensions\n   may cause interoperability problems, we recognize\
    \ the existence of\n   such extensions.\n   For example:\n      Content-Type:\
    \ text/plain; charset=CN-Big5; charset-edition=1984;\n       charset-extension=ETen-2.00.03-DOS\n\
