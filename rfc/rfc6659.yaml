  - "Abstract\n   The Rapid Acquisition of Multicast RTP Sessions (RAMS) solution\
    \ is a\n   method based on RTP and the RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) that enables\n\
    \   an RTP receiver to rapidly acquire and start consuming the RTP\n   multicast\
    \ data.  Upon a request from the RTP receiver, an auxiliary\n   unicast RTP retransmission\
    \ session is set up between a retransmission\n   server and the RTP receiver,\
    \ over which the reference information\n   about the new multicast stream the\
    \ RTP receiver is about to join is\n   transmitted at an accelerated rate.  This\
    \ often precedes, but may\n   also accompany, the multicast stream itself.  When\
    \ there is only one\n   multicast stream to be acquired, the RAMS solution works\
    \ in a\n   straightforward manner.  However, when there are two or more\n   multicast\
    \ streams to be acquired from the same or different multicast\n   RTP sessions,\
    \ care should be taken to configure each RAMS session\n   appropriately.  This\

  - "1.  Introduction\n   The Rapid Acquisition of Multicast RTP Sessions (RAMS) solution\
    \ is a\n   method based on RTP and the RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) that enables\n\
    \   an RTP receiver to rapidly acquire and start consuming the RTP\n   multicast\
    \ data.  Through an auxiliary unicast RTP retransmission\n   session [RFC4588],\
    \ the RTP receiver receives reference information\n   about the new multicast\
    \ stream it is about to join.  This often\n   precedes, but may also accompany,\
    \ the multicast stream itself.  The\n   RAMS solution is documented in detail\
    \ in [RFC6285].\n   The RAMS specification [RFC6285] has provisions for concurrently\n\
    \   acquiring multiple streams inside a multicast RTP session.  However,\n   the\
    \ RAMS specification does not discuss scenarios where an RTP\n   receiver makes\
    \ use of the RAMS method to rapidly acquire multiple and\n   associated multicast\
    \ streams in parallel, or where different RTP\n   sessions are part of the same\
    \ Source-Specific Multicast (SSM)\n   session.  The example presented in Section\
    \ 8.3 of [RFC6285] addresses\n   only the simple case of an RTP receiver rapidly\
    \ acquiring only one\n   multicast stream to explain the protocol details.\n \
    \  There are certain deployment models where a multicast RTP session\n   might\
    \ have two or more multicast streams associated with it.  There\n   are also cases\
    \ where an RTP receiver might be interested in acquiring\n   one or more multicast\
    \ streams from several multicast RTP sessions.\n   Close coordination is required\
    \ for multiple RAMS sessions\n   simultaneously started by an RTP server, where\
    \ each session is\n   initiated with an individual RAMS Request message to a different\n\
    \   feedback target.  In this document, we present scenarios from real-\n   life\
    \ deployments and discuss how the RAMS solution could be used in\n   such scenarios.\n"
- title: 2.  Background
  contents:
  - "2.  Background\n   In the following discussion, we assume that there are two\
    \ RTP streams\n   (1 and 2) that are in some manner associated with each other.\
    \  These\n   could be audio and video elementary streams for the same TV channel,\n\
    \   or they could be an MPEG2 Transport Stream (that has audio and video\n   multiplexed\
    \ together) and its Forward Error Correction (FEC) stream.\n   An SSM session\
    \ is defined by its (distribution) source address and\n   (destination) multicast\
    \ group, and there can be only one feedback\n   target per SSM session [RFC5760].\
    \  So, if the RTP streams are\n   distributed by different sources or over different\
    \ multicast groups,\n   they are considered different SSM sessions.  While different\
    \ SSM\n   sessions can normally share the same feedback target address and/or\n\
    \   port, RAMS requires each unique feedback target (i.e., the\n   combination\
    \ of address and port) to be associated with at most one\n   RTP session (See\
    \ Section 6.2 of [RFC6285]).\n   Two or more multicast RTP streams can be transmitted\
    \ in the same RTP\n   session (e.g., in a single UDP flow).  This is called Synchronization\n\
    \   Source (SSRC) multiplexing.  In this case, (de)multiplexing is done\n   at\
    \ the SSRC level.  Alternatively, the multicast RTP streams can be\n   transmitted\
    \ in different RTP sessions (e.g., in different UDP flows),\n   which is called\
    \ session multiplexing.  In practice, there are\n   different deployment models\
    \ for each multiplexing scheme.\n   Generally, to avoid complications in RTCP\
    \ reports, it is suggested\n   that two different media streams with different\
    \ clock rates use\n   different SSRCs or be carried in different RTP sessions.\
    \  Some of the\n   fields in RAMS messages might depend on the clock rate.  Thus,\
    \ in a\n   single RTP session, RTP streams carrying payloads with different\n\
    \   clock rates need to have different SSRCs.  Since RTP streams with\n   different\
    \ SSRCs do not share the sequence numbering, each stream\n   needs to be acquired\
    \ individually.\n   In the remaining sections, only the relevant portions of the\
    \ Session\n   Description Protocol (SDP) descriptions [RFC4566] will be provided.\n\
    \   For an example of a full SDP description, refer to Section 8.3 of\n   [RFC6285].\n"

    \ in the request.\n   In this case, the RTP receiver can first acquire the primary\
    \ video\n   stream at the full receive bitrate.  But, upon the multicast join,\n\
    \   the available bandwidth for the burst drops to 11 Mbps instead of\n   12 Mbps.\
    \  Regardless of whether FEC is desired or not by the RTP\n   receiver, its bitrate\
    \ needs to be taken into account once the RTP\n   receiver joins the SSM session.\n"

    \   Similar to scenario #2, both the primary video and audio streams can\n   be\

    \ primary video stream, if desired, by indicating its specific\n   SSRC in the\
    \ request.\n   Note that based on the \"a=fmtp\" line for the FEC stream, it could\
    \ be\n   possible to infer the bitrate of this FEC stream and set the Max\n  \
    \ Receive Bitrate value accordingly.\n"
