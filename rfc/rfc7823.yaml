  - "Abstract\n   In certain networks, it is critical to consider network performance\n\
    \   criteria when selecting the path for an explicitly routed RSVP-TE\n   Label\
    \ Switched Path (LSP).  Such performance criteria can include\n   latency, jitter,\
    \ and loss or other indications such as the\n   conformance to link performance\
    \ objectives and non-RSVP TE traffic\n   load.  This specification describes how\
    \ a path computation function\n   may use network performance data, such as is\
    \ advertised via the OSPF\n   and IS-IS TE metric extensions (defined outside\
    \ the scope of this\n   document) to perform such path selections.\n"

  - "1.  Introduction\n   In certain networks, such as financial information networks,\
    \ network\n   performance information is becoming as critical to data-path\n \
    \  selection as other existing metrics.  Network performance information\n   can\
    \ be obtained via either the TE Metric Extensions in OSPF [RFC7471]\n   or IS-IS\
    \ [RFC7810] or via a management system.  As with other TE\n   information flooded\
    \ via OSPF or IS-IS, the TE metric extensions have\n   a flooding scope limited\
    \ to the local area or level.  This document\n   describes how a path computation\
    \ function, whether in an ingress LSR\n   or a PCE [RFC4655], can use that information\
    \ for path selection for\n   explicitly routed LSPs.  The selected path may be\
    \ signaled via RSVP-\n   TE [RFC3209] [RFC3473] or simply used by the ingress\
    \ with segment\n   routing [SEG-ROUTE-MPLS] to properly forward the packet.  Methods\
    \ of\n   optimizing path selection for multiple parameters are generally\n   computationally\
    \ complex.  However, there are good heuristics for the\n   delay-constrained lowest-cost\
    \ (DCLC) computation problem\n   [k-Paths_DCLC] that can be applied to consider\
    \ both path cost and a\n   maximum delay bound.  Some of the network performance\
    \ information can\n   also be used to prune links from a topology before computing\
    \ the\n   path.\n   The path selection mechanisms described in this document apply\
    \ to\n   paths that are fully computed by the head-end of the LSP and then\n \
    \  signaled in an Explicit Route Object (ERO) where every sub-object is\n   strict.\
    \  This allows the head-end to consider IGP-distributed\n   performance data without\
    \ requiring the ability to signal the\n   performance constraints in an object\
    \ of the RSVP Path message.\n   When considering performance-based data, it is\
    \ obvious that there are\n   additional contributors to latency beyond just the\
    \ links.  Clearly\n   end-to-end latency is a combination of router latency (e.g.,\
    \ latency\n   from traversing a router without queueing delay), queuing latency,\n\
    \   physical link latency, and other factors.  While traversing a router\n   can\
    \ cause delay, that router latency can be included in the\n   advertised link\
    \ delay.  As described in [RFC7471] and [RFC7810],\n   queuing delay must not\
    \ be included in the measurements advertised by\n   OSPF or IS-IS.\n   Queuing\
    \ latency is specifically excluded to insure freedom from\n   oscillations and\
    \ stability issues that have plagued prior attempts to\n   use delay as a routing\
    \ metric.  If application traffic follows a path\n   based upon latency constraints,\
    \ the same traffic might be in an\n   Expedited Forwarding Per-Hop Behavior (PHB)\
    \ [RFC3246] with minimal\n   queuing delay or another PHB with potentially very\
    \ substantial per-\n   hop queuing delay.  Only traffic that experiences relatively\
    \ low\n   congestion, such as Expedited Forwarding traffic, will experience\n\
    \   delays very close to the sum of the reported link delays.\n   This document\
    \ does not specify how a router determines what values to\n   advertise by the\
    \ IGP; it does assume that the constraints specified\n   in [RFC7471] and [RFC7810]\
    \ are followed.  Additionally, the end-to-\n   end performance that is computed\
    \ for an LSP path should be built from\n   the individual link data.  Any end-to-end\
    \ characterization used to\n   determine an LSP's performance compliance should\
    \ be fully reflected\n   in the Traffic Engineering Database so that a path calculation\
    \ can\n   also determine whether a path under consideration would be in\n   compliance.\n"

- title: 1.2.  Oscillation and Stability Considerations
  contents:
  - "1.2.  Oscillation and Stability Considerations\n   Past attempts to use unbounded\
    \ delay or loss as a metric suffered\n   from severe oscillations.  The use of\
    \ performance based data must be\n   such that undamped oscillations are not possible\
    \ and stability cannot\n   be impacted.\n   The use of timers is often cited as\
    \ a cure.  Oscillation that is\n   damped by timers is known as \"slosh\".  If\
    \ advertisement timers are\n   very short relative to the jitter applied to RSVP-TE\
    \ Constrained\n   Shortest Path First (CSPF) timers, then a partial oscillation\
    \ occurs.\n   If RSVP-TE CSPF timers are short relative to advertisement timers,\n\
    \   full oscillation (all traffic moving back and forth) can occur.  Even\n  \
    \ a partial oscillation causes unnecessary reordering that is\n   considered at\
    \ least minimally disruptive.\n   Delay variation or jitter is affected by even\
    \ small traffic levels.\n   At even tiny traffic levels, the probability of a\
    \ queue occupancy of\n   one can produce a measured jitter proportional to or\
    \ equal to the\n   packet serialization delay.  Very low levels of traffic can\
    \ increase\n   the probability of queue occupancies of two or three packets enough\n\
    \   to further increase the measured jitter.  Because jitter measurement\n   is\
    \ extremely sensitive to very low traffic levels, any use of jitter\n   is likely\
    \ to oscillate.  However, there may be uses of a jitter\n   measurement in path\
    \ computation that can be considered free of\n   oscillation.\n   Delay measurements\
    \ that are not sensitive to traffic loads may be\n   safely used in path computation.\
    \  Delay measurements made at the link\n   layer or measurements made at a queuing\
    \ priority higher than any\n   significant traffic (such as Differentiated Services\
    \ Code Point\n   (DSCP) CS7 or CS6 [RFC4594], but not CS2 if traffic levels at\
    \ CS3 and\n   higher or Expedited Forwarding and Assured Forwarding can affect\
    \ the\n   measurement).  Making delay measurements at the same priority as the\n\
    \   traffic on affected paths is likely to cause oscillations.\n"

  contents:
  - "2.1.  End-to-End Constraints\n   The per-link performance data available in the\
    \ IGP [RFC7471]\n   [RFC7810] includes: unidirectional link delay, unidirectional\
    \ delay\n   variation, and link loss.  Each (or all) of these parameters can be\n\
    \   used to create the path-level link-based parameter.\n   It is possible to\
    \ compute a CSPF where the link latency values are\n   used instead of TE metrics;\
    \ this results in ignoring the TE metrics\n   and causing LSPs to prefer the lowest-latency\
    \ paths.  In practical\n   scenarios, latency constraints are typically a bound\
    \ constraint\n   rather than a minimization objective.  An end-to-end latency\
    \ upper\n   bound merely requires that the path computed be no more than that\n\
    \   bound and does not require that it be the minimum latency path.  The\n   latter\
    \ is exactly the DCLC problem to which good heuristics have been\n   proposed\
    \ in the literature (e.g., [k-Paths_DCLC]).\n   An end-to-end bound on delay variation\
    \ can be used similarly as a\n   constraint in the path computation on what links\
    \ to explore where the\n   path's delay variation is the sum of the used links'\
    \ delay\n   variations.\n   For link loss, the path loss is not the sum of the\
    \ used links'\n   losses.  Instead, the path loss fraction is 1 - (1 - loss_L1)*\n\
    \   (1 - loss_L2)*...*(1 - loss_Ln), where the links along the path are\n   L1\
    \ to Ln with loss_Li in fractions.  This computation is discussed in\n   more\
    \ detail in Sections 5.1.4 and 5.1.5 in [RFC6049].  The end-to-end\n   link loss\
    \ bound, computed in this fashion, can also be used as a\n   constraint in the\
    \ path computation.\n   The heuristic algorithms for DCLC only address one constraint\
    \ bound\n   but having a CSPF that limits the paths explored (i.e., based on hop\n\
    \   count) can be combined [hop-count_DCLC].\n"
- title: 2.2.  Link Constraints
  contents:
  - "2.2.  Link Constraints\n   In addition to selecting paths that conform to a bound\
    \ on performance\n   data, it is also useful to avoid using links that do not\
    \ meet a\n   necessary constraint.  Naturally, if such a parameter were a known\n\
    \   fixed value, then resource attribute flags could be used to express\n   this\
    \ behavior.  However, when the parameter associated with a link\n   may vary dynamically,\
    \ there is not currently a configuration-time\n   mechanism to enforce such behavior.\
    \  An example of this is described\n   in Section 2.3, where links may move in\
    \ and out of conformance for\n   link performance objectives with regards to latency,\
    \ delay variation,\n   and link loss.\n   When doing path selection for TE tunnels,\
    \ it has not been possible to\n   know how much actual bandwidth is available\
    \ that includes the\n   bandwidth used by non-RSVP-TE traffic.  In [RFC7471] and\
    \ [RFC7810],\n   the Unidirectional Available Bandwidth is advertised as is the\n\
    \   Residual Bandwidth.  When computing the path for a TE tunnel, only\n   links\
    \ with at least a minimum amount of Unidirectional Available\n   Bandwidth might\
    \ be permitted.\n   Similarly, only links whose loss is under a configurable value\
    \ might\n   be acceptable.  For these constraints, each link can be tested\n \
    \  against the constraint and only explored in the path computation if\n   the\
    \ link passes.  In essence, a link that fails the constraint test\n   is treated\
    \ as if it contained a resource attribute in the exclude-any\n   filter.\n"

    \  It can also be\n   considered an indication that something is changing that\
