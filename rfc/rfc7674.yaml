  - "1.  Introduction\n   \"Dissemination of Flow Specification Rules\" [RFC5575],\
    \ commonly known\n   as BGP Flowspec, provided for a BGP Extended Community [RFC4360]\
    \ that\n   served to redirect traffic to a Virtual Routing and Forwarding (VRF)\n\
    \   instance that matched the flow specification's Network Layer\n   Reachability\
    \ Information (NLRI).  In RFC 5575, the Redirect Extended\n   Community was documented\
    \ as follows:\n   : +--------+--------------------+--------------------------+\n\
    \   : | type   | extended community | encoding                 |\n   : +--------+--------------------+--------------------------+\n\
    \   : | 0x8008 | redirect           | 6-byte Route Target      |\n   : +--------+--------------------+--------------------------+\n\
    \   :\n   : [...]\n   :\n   : Redirect:  The redirect extended community allows\
    \ the traffic to be\n   : redirected to a VRF routing instance that lists the\
    \ specified\n   : route-target in its import policy.  If several local instances\n\
    \   : match this criteria, the choice between them is a local matter\n   : (for\
    \ example, the instance with the lowest Route Distinguisher\n   : value can be\
    \ elected).  This extended community uses the same\n   : encoding as the Route\
    \ Target extended community [RFC4360].\n   : [...]\n   :\n   : 11. IANA Considerations\n\
    \   : [...]\n   :\n   : The following traffic filtering flow specification rules\
    \ have been\n   : allocated by IANA from the \"BGP Extended Communities Type -\n\
    \   : Experimental Use\" registry as follows:\n   : [...]\n   :\n   : 0x8008 -\
    \ Flow spec redirect\n   The IANA registry of BGP Extended Communities clearly\
    \ identifies\n   communities of specific formats.  For example, \"Two-octet AS\
    \ Specific\n   Extended Community\" [RFC4360], \"Four-octet AS Specific Extended\n\
    \   Community\" [RFC5668], and \"IPv4 Address Specific Extended Community\"\n\
    \   [RFC4360].  Route Targets [RFC4360] identify this format in the high-\n  \
    \ order (Type) octet of the Extended Community and set the value of the\n   low-order\
    \ (Sub-Type) octet to 0x02.  The Value field of the Route\n   Target Extended\
    \ Community is intended to be interpreted in the\n   context of its format.\n\
    \   Since the Redirect Extended Community only registered a single\n   codepoint\
    \ in IANA's BGP Extended Community registry, a common\n   interpretation of the\
    \ Redirect Extended Community's \"6-byte Route\n   Target\" has been to look,\
    \ at a receiving router, for a Route Target\n   value that matches the Route Target\
    \ value in the received Redirect\n   Extended Community and import the advertised\
    \ route to the\n   corresponding VRF instance subject to the rules defined in\
    \ [RFC5575].\n   However, because the Route Target format in the Redirect Extended\n\
    \   Community is not clearly defined, the wrong match may occur.\n   This \"value\
    \ wildcard\" matching behavior, which does not take into\n   account the format\
    \ of the Route Target defined for a local VRF and\n   may result in the wrong\
    \ matching decision, does not match deployed\n   implementations of BGP Flowspec.\
    \  Deployed implementations of BGP\n   Flowspec solve this problem by defining\
    \ different Redirect Extended\n   Communities that are specific to the format\
    \ of the Route Target\n   value.  This document defines the following Redirect\
    \ Extended\n   Communities:\n   +--------+--------------------+-------------------------------------+\n\
    \   | type   | extended community | encoding                            |\n  \
    \ +--------+--------------------+-------------------------------------+\n   |\
    \ 0x8008 | redirect AS-2byte  | 2-octet AS, 4-octet Value           |\n   | 0x8108\
    \ | redirect IPv4      | 4-octet IPv4 Address, 2-octet Value |\n   | 0x8208 |\
    \ redirect AS-4byte  | 4-octet AS, 2-octet Value           |\n   +--------+--------------------+-------------------------------------+\n\
    \   It should be noted that the low-order nibble of the Redirect's Type\n   field\
    \ corresponds to the Route Target Extended Community format field\n   (Type).\
    \  (See Sections 3.1, 3.2, and 4 of [RFC4360] plus Section 2 of\n   [RFC5668].)\
    \  The low-order octet (Sub-Type) of the Redirect Extended\n   Community remains\
    \ 0x08, in contrast to 0x02 for Route Targets.\n   The IANA registries for the\
    \ BGP Extended Communities document\n   [RFC7153] was written to update the previously\
    \ mentioned IANA\n   registries to better document BGP Extended Community formats.\
    \  The\n   IANA Considerations section below further amends those registry\n \
    \  updates in order to properly document the Flowspec redirect\n   communities.\n"
