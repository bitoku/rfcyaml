  - "1.  Introduction\n   Original uses of an underscore character as a domain node\
    \ name\n   [RFC1035] prefix, which creates a space for constrained\n   interpretation\
    \ of resource records, were specified without the\n   benefit of an IANA registry\
    \ [IANA-reg].  This produced an entirely\n   uncoordinated set of name-creation\
    \ activities, all drawing from the\n   same namespace.  A registry has now been\
    \ defined (see Section 4 of\n   [RFC8552]); the RFC that defined it discusses\
    \ the background for the\n   use of underscored domain names [RFC8552].\n   The\
    \ basic model for underscored name registration, as specified in\n   [RFC8552],\
    \ is to have each registry entry be unique in terms of the\n   combination of\
    \ a resource record type and a \"global\" (highest-level)\n   underscored node\
    \ name; that is, the node name beginning with an\n   underscore that is the closest\
    \ to the DNS root.\n   The specifications describing the existing uses of underscored\
    \ naming\n   do not reflect the existence of this integrated registry.  For the\n\
    \   new reader or the new editor of one of those documents, there is\n   currently\
    \ nothing signaling that the underscored name(s) defined in\n   the document are\
    \ now processed through an IANA registry.  This\n   document remedies that, by\
    \ marking such a published document with an\n   update that indicates the nature\
    \ of the change.\n   Further, the documents that define the SRV [RFC2782] and\
    \ URI\n   [RFC7553] DNS resource records provide a meta-template for\n   underscored\
    \ name assignments, partially based on separate registries\n   [RFC6335].  For\
    \ the portion that selects the global (highest-level)\n   underscored node name,\
    \ this perpetuates uncoordinated assignment\n   activities by separate technical\
    \ specifications, out of the same\n   namespace.  This document remedies that\
    \ by providing detail for\n   revisions to the SRV and URI specifications to bring\
    \ their use in\n   line with the single, integrated \"Underscored and Globally\
    \ Scoped DNS\n   Node Names\" registry.\n   The result of these changes preserves\
    \ existing software and\n   operations practices while adapting the technical\
    \ specifications to\n   the newer underscore registry model.\n   The key words\
    \ \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\"\
    , \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"NOT RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and\n   \"OPTIONAL\"\
    \ in this document are to be interpreted as described in\n   BCP 14 [RFC2119]\
    \ [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all\n   capitals, as shown here.\n"
- title: 2.  Underscored RRset Use in Specifications
  contents:
  - "2.  Underscored RRset Use in Specifications\n   The use of underscored node names\
    \ is specific to each RR TYPE that is\n   being scoped.  Each name defines a place\
    \ but does not define the\n   rules for what appears underneath that place, either\
    \ as additional\n   underscored naming or as a leaf node with resource records.\
    \  Details\n   for those rules are provided by specifications for individual RR\n\
    \   TYPEs.  The sections below describe the way that existing underscored\n  \
