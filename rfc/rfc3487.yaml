  - "1.  Introduction\n   During emergencies, communications resources including telephone\n\
    \   circuits, IP bandwidth and gateways between the circuit-switched and\n   IP\
    \ networks may become congested.  Congestion can occur due to heavy\n   usage,\
    \ loss of resources caused by the natural or man-made disaster\n   and attacks\
    \ on the network during man-made emergencies.  This\n   congestion may make it\
    \ difficult for persons charged with emergency\n   assistance, recovery or law\
    \ enforcement to coordinate their efforts.\n   As IP networks become part of converged\
    \ or hybrid networks along with\n   public and private circuit-switched (telephone)\
    \ networks, it becomes\n   necessary to ensure that these networks can assist\
    \ during such\n   emergencies.\n   There are many IP-based services that can assist\
    \ during emergencies.\n   This memo only covers requirements for real-time communications\n\
    \   applications involving the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) [1],\n   including\
    \ voice-over-IP, multimedia conferencing and instant\n   messaging/presence.\n\
    \   This document takes no position as to which mode of communication is\n   preferred\
    \ during an emergency, as such discussion appears to be of\n   little practical\
    \ value.  Based on past experience, real-time\n   communications is likely to\
    \ be an important component of any overall\n   suite of applications, particularly\
    \ for coordination of emergency-\n   related efforts.\n   As we will describe\
    \ in detail below, such Session Initiation Protocol\n   (SIP) [1] applications\
    \ involve at least five different resources that\n   may become scarce and congested\
    \ during emergencies.  In order to\n   improve emergency response, it may become\
    \ necessary to prioritize\n   access to such resources during periods of emergency-induced\
    \ resource\n   scarcity.  We call this \"resource prioritization\".\n   This document\
    \ describes requirements rather than possible existing or\n   new protocol features.\
    \  Although it is scoped to deal with SIP-based\n   applications, this should\
    \ not be taken to imply that mechanisms have\n   to be SIP protocol features such\
    \ as header fields, methods or URI\n   parameters.\n   The document is organized\
    \ as follows.  In Section 2, we explain core\n   technical terms and acronyms\
    \ that are used throughout the document.\n   Section 3 describes the five types\
    \ of resources that may be subject\n   to resource prioritization.  Section 4\
    \ enumerates four network\n   hybrids that determine which of these resources\
    \ are relevant.  Since\n   the design choices may be constrained by the assumptions\
    \ placed on\n   the IP network, Section 5 attempts to classify networks into\n\
    \   categories according to the restrictions placed on modifications and\n   traffic\
    \ classes.\n   Since this is a major source of confusion due to similar names,\n\
    \   Section 6 attempts to distinguish emergency call services placed by\n   civilians\
    \ from the topic of this document.\n   Request routing is a core component of\
    \ SIP, covered in Section 7.\n   Providing resource priority entails complex implementation\
    \ choices,\n   so that a single priority scheme leads to a set of algorithms that\n\
    \   manage queues, resource consumption and resource usage of existing\n   calls.\
    \  Even within a single administrative domain, the combination\n   of mechanisms\
    \ is likely to vary.  Since it will also depend on the\n   interaction of different\
    \ policies, it appears inappropriate to have\n   SIP applications specify the\
    \ precise mechanisms.  Section 8 discusses\n   the call-by-value (specification\
    \ of mechanisms) and call-by-reference\n   (invoke labeled policy) distinction.\n\
    \   Based on these discussions, Section 9 summarizes some general\n   requirements\
    \ that try to achieve generality and feature-transparency\n   across hybrid networks.\n\
    \   The most challenging component of resource prioritization is likely\n   to\
    \ be security (Section 10).  Without adequate security mechanisms,\n   resource\
    \ priority may cause more harm than good, so that the section\n   attempts to\
    \ enumerate some of the specific threats present when\n   resource prioritization\
    \ is being employed.\n"

  - "2.  Terminology\n   CSN: Circuit-switched network, encompassing both private\n\
    \      (closed) networks and the public switched telephone network\n      (PSTN).\n\
    \   ETS: Emergency telecommunications service, identifying a\n      communications\
    \ service to be used during large-scale emergencies\n      that allows authorized\
    \ individuals to communicate.  Such\n      communication may reach end points\
    \ either within a closed network\n      or any endpoint on the CSN or the Internet.\
    \  The communication\n      service may use voice, video, text or other multimedia\
    \ streams.\n   Request: In this document, we define \"request\" as any SIP\n \
    \     request.  This includes call setup requests, instant message\n      requests\
    \ and event notification requests.\n"
- title: 3.  Resources
  contents:
  - "3.  Resources\n   Prioritized access to at least five resource types may be useful:\n\
    \   Gateway resources: The number of channels (trunks) on a CSN\n      gateway\
    \ is finite.  Resource prioritization may prioritize access\n      to these channels,\
    \ by priority queuing or preemption.\n   CSN resources: Resources in the CSN itself,\
    \ away from the access\n      gateway, may be congested.  This is the domain of\
    \ traditional\n      resource prioritization mechanisms such as MLPP and GETS,\
    \ where\n      circuits are granted to ETS communications based on queuing\n \
    \     priority or preemption (if allowed by local telecommunication\n      regulatory\
    \ policy and local administrative procedures).  A gateway\n      may also use\
    \ alternate routing (Section 8) to increase the\n      probability of call completion.\n\
    \      Specifying CSN behavior is beyond the scope of this document, but\n   \
    \   as noted below, a central requirement is to be able to invoke all\n      such\
    \ behaviors from an IP endpoint.\n   IP network resources: SIP may initiate voice\
    \ and multimedia\n      sessions.  In many cases, audio and video streams are\
    \ inelastic\n      and have tight delay and loss requirements.  Under conditions\
    \ of\n      IP network overload, emergency services applications may not be\n\
    \      able to obtain sufficient bandwidth in any network.  When there\n     \
    \ are insufficient network resources for all users and it is not\n      practical\
    \ to simply add more resources, quality of service\n      management is necessary\
    \ to solve this problem.  This is orthogonal\n      to SIP, out of the scope for\
    \ SIP, and as such these requirements\n      will be discussed in another document.\n\
    \      Bandwidth used for SIP signaling itself may be subject to\n      prioritization.\n\
    \   Receiving end system resources: End systems may include\n      automatic call\
    \ distribution systems (ACDs) or media servers as\n      well as traditional telephone-like\
    \ devices.  Gateways are also end\n      systems, but have been discussed earlier.\n\
    \      Since the receiving end system can only manage a finite number of\n   \
    \   sessions, a prioritized call may need to preempt an existing call\n      or\
    \ indicate to the callee that a high-priority call is waiting.\n      (The precise\
    \ user agent behavior is beyond the scope of this\n      document and considered\
    \ a matter of policy and implementation.)\n      Such terminating services may\
    \ be needed to avoid overloading, say,\n      an emergency coordination center.\
    \ However, other approaches beyond\n      prioritization, e.g., random request\
    \ dropping by geographic\n      origin, need to be employed if the number of prioritized\
    \ calls\n      exceeds the terminating capacity.  Such approaches are beyond the\n\
    \      scope of this memo.\n   SIP proxy resources: While SIP proxies often have\
    \ large request\n      handling capacities, their capacity is likely to be smaller\
    \ than\n      their access network bandwidth.  (This is true in particular since\n\
    \      different SIP requests consume vastly different amounts of proxy\n    \
    \  computational resources, depending on whether they invoke external\n      services,\
    \ sip-cgi [2] and CPL [3] scripts, etc.  Thus, avoiding\n      proxy overload\
    \ by restricting access bandwidth is likely to lead\n      to inefficient utilization\
    \ of the proxy.)  Therefore, some types\n      of proxies may need to silently\
    \ drop selected SIP requests under\n      overload, reject requests, with overload\
    \ indication or provide\n      multiple queues with different drop and scheduling\
    \ priorities for\n      different types of SIP requests.  However, this is strictly\
    \ an\n      implementation issue and does not appear to influence the protocol\n\
    \      requirements nor the on-the-wire protocol.  Thus, it is out of\n      scope\
    \ for the protocol requirements discussion pursued here.\n      Responses should\
    \ naturally receive the same treatment as the\n      corresponding request.  Responses\
    \ already have to be securely\n      mapped to requests, so this requirement does\
    \ not pose a\n      significant burden.  Since proxies often do not maintain call\n\
    \      state, it is not generally feasible to assign elevated priority to\n  \
    \    requests originating from a lower-privileged callee back to the\n      higher-privileged\
    \ caller.\n   There is no requirement that a single mechanism be used for all\
    \ five\n   resources.\n"
- title: 4.  Network Topologies
  contents:
  - "4.  Network Topologies\n   We consider four types of combinations of IP and circuit-switched\n\
    \   networks.\n   IP end-to-end: Both request originator and destination are on\
    \ an\n      IP network, without intervening CSN-IP gateways.  Here, any SIP\n\
    \      request could be subject to prioritization.\n   IP-to-CSN (IP at the start):\
    \ The request originator is in the IP\n      network, while the callee is in the\
    \ CSN.  Clearly, this model only\n      applies to SIP-originated phone calls,\
    \ not generic SIP requests\n      such as those supporting instant messaging services.\n\
    \   CSN-to-IP (IP at the end): A call originates in the CSN and\n      terminates,\
    \ via an Internet telephony gateway, in the IP network.\n   CSN-IP-CSN (IP bridging):\
    \ This is a concatenation of the two\n      previous ones.  It is worth calling\
    \ out specifically to note that\n      the two CSN sides may use different signaling\
    \ protocols.  Also,\n      the originating CSN endpoint and the gateway to the\
    \ IP network may\n      not know the nature of the terminating CSN.  Thus, encapsulation\n\
    \      of originating CSN information is insufficient.\n   The bridging model\
    \ (IP-CSN-IP) can be treated as the concatenation of\n   the IP-to-CSN and CSN-to-IP\
    \ cases.\n   It is worth emphasizing that CSN-to-IP gateways are unlikely to know\n\
    \   whether the final destination is in the IP network, the CSN or, via\n   SIP\
    \ forking, in both.\n   These models differ in the type of controllable resources,\
    \ identified\n   as gateway, CSN, IP network resources, proxy and receiver.  Items\n\
    \   marked as (x) are beyond the scope of this document.\n   Topology       Gateway\

- title: 5.  Network Models
  contents:
  - "5.  Network Models\n   There are at least four IP network models that influence\
    \ the\n   requirements for resource priority.  Each model inherits the\n   restrictions\
    \ of the model above it.\n   Pre-configured for ETS: In a pre-configured network,\
    \ an ETS\n      application can use any protocol carried in IP packets and modify\n\
    \      the behavior of existing protocols.  As an example, if an ETS\n      agency\
    \ owns the IP network, it can add traffic shaping, scheduling\n      or support\
    \ for a resource reservation protocol to routers.\n   Transparent: In a transparent\
    \ network, an ETS application can\n      rely on the network to forward all valid\
    \ IP packets, however, the\n      ETS application cannot modify network elements.\
    \  Commercial ISP\n      offer transparent networks as long as they do not filter\
    \ certain\n      types of packets.  Networks employing firewalls, NATs and\n \
    \     \"transparent\" proxies are not transparent.  Sometimes, these types\n \
    \     of networks are also called common-carrier networks since they\n      carry\
    \ IP packets without concern as to their content.\n   SIP/RTP transparent: Networks\
    \ that are SIP/RTP transparent allow\n      users to place and receive SIP calls.\
    \  The network allows ingress\n      and egress for all valid SIP messages, possibly\
    \ subject to\n      authentication.  Similarly, it allows RTP media streams in\
    \ both\n      directions.  However, it may block, in either inbound or outbound\n\
    \      direction, other protocols such as RSVP or it may disallow non-\n     \
    \ zero DSCPs.  There are many degrees of SIP/RTP transparency, e.g.,\n      depending\
    \ on whether firewalls require inspection of SDP content,\n      thus precluding\
    \ end-to-end encryption of certain SIP message\n      bodies, or whether only\
    \ outbound calls are allowed.  Many\n      firewalled corporate networks and semi-public\
    \ access networks such\n      as in hotels are likely to fall into this category.\n\
    \   Restricted SIP networks: In restricted SIP networks, users may\n      be restricted\
    \ to particular SIP applications and cannot add SIP\n      protocol elements such\
    \ as header fields or use SIP methods beyond\n      a prescribed set.  It appears\
    \ likely that 3GPP/3GPP2 networks will\n      fall into this category, at least\
    \ initially.\n      A separate and distinct problem are SIP networks that\n  \
    \    administratively prohibit or fail to configure access to special\n      access\
    \ numbers, e.g., the 710 area code used by GETS.  Such\n      operational failures\
    \ are beyond the reach of a protocol\n      specification.\n   It appears desirable\
    \ that ETS users can employ the broadest possible\n   set of networks during an\
    \ emergency.  Thus, it appears preferable\n   that protocol enhancements work\
    \ at least in SIP/RTP transparent\n   networks and are added explicitly to restricted\
    \ SIP networks.\n   The existing GETS system relies on a transparent network,\
    \ allowing\n   use from most unmodified telephones, while MLPP systems are typically\n\
    \   pre-configured.\n"
- title: 6.  Relationship to Emergency Call Services
  contents:
  - "6.  Relationship to Emergency Call Services\n   The resource priority mechanisms\
    \ are used to have selected\n   individuals place calls with elevated priority\
    \ during times when the\n   network is suffering from a shortage of resources.\
    \  Generally, calls\n   for emergency help placed by non-officials (e.g., \"911\"\
    \ and \"112\"\n   calls) do not need resource priority under normal circumstances.\
    \  If\n   such emergency calls are placed during emergency-induced network\n \
    \  resource shortages, the call identifier itself is sufficient to\n   identify\
    \ the emergency nature of the call.  Adding an indication of\n   resource priority\
    \ may be less appropriate, as this would require that\n   all such calls carry\
    \ this indicator.  Also, it opens another attack\n   mechanism, where non-emergency\
    \ calls are marked as emergency calls.\n   (If network elements can recognize\
    \ the request URI as an emergency\n   call, they would not need the resource priority\
    \ mechanism.)\n"
- title: 7.  SIP Call Routing
  contents:
  - "7.  SIP Call Routing\n   The routing of a SIP request, i.e., the proxies it visits\
    \ and the UAs\n   it ends up at, may depend on the fact that the SIP request is\
    \ an ETS\n   request.  The set of destinations may be larger or smaller, depending\n\
    \   on the SIP request routing policies implemented by proxies.  For\n   example,\
    \ certain gateways may be reserved for ETS use and thus only\n   be reached by\
    \ labeled SIP requests.\n"
- title: 8.  Policy and Mechanism
  contents:
  - "8.  Policy and Mechanism\n   Most priority mechanisms can be roughly categorized\
    \ by whether they:\n   o  use a priority queue for resource attempts,\n   o  make\
    \ additional resources available (e.g., via alternate routing\n      (ACR)), or\n\
    \   o  preempt existing resource users (e.g., calls.)\n   For example, in GETS,\
    \ alternate routing attempts to use alternate\n   GETS-enabled interexchange carriers\
    \ (IXC) if it cannot be completed\n   through the first-choice carrier.\n   Priority\
    \ mechanisms may also exempt certain calls from network\n   management traffic\
    \ controls.\n   The choice between these mechanisms depends on the operational\
    \ needs\n   and characteristics of the network, e.g., on the number of active\n\
    \   requests in the system and the fraction of prioritized calls.\n   Generally,\
    \ if the number of prioritized calls is small compared to\n   the system capacity\
    \ and the system capacity is large, it is likely\n   that another call will naturally\
    \ terminate in short order when a\n   higher-priority call arrives.  Thus, it\
    \ is conceivable that the\n   priority indication can cause preemption in some\
    \ network entities,\n   while elsewhere it just influences whether requests are\
    \ queued\n   instead of discarded and what queueing policy is being applied.\n\
    \   Some namespaces may inherently imply a preemption policy, while\n   others\
    \ may be silent on whether preemption is to be used or not,\n   leaving this to\
    \ local entity policy.\n   Similarly, the precise relationships between labels,\
    \ e.g., what\n   fraction of capacity is set aside for each priority level, is\
    \ also a\n   matter of local policy.  This is similar to how differentiated\n\
    \   services labels are handled.\n"
- title: 9.  Requirements
  contents:
  - "9.  Requirements\n   In the PSTN and certain private circuit-switched networks,\
    \ such as\n   those run by military organizations, calls are marked in various\
    \ ways\n   to indicate priorities.  We call this a \"priority scheme\".\n   Below\
    \ are some requirements for providing a similar feature in a SIP\n   environment;\
    \ security requirements are discussed in Section 10.  We\n   will refer to the\
    \ feature as a \"SIP indication\" and to requests\n   carrying such an indication\
    \ as \"labelled requests\".\n   Note:  Not all the following requirements are\
    \ possible to meet at\n   once.  They may represent in some case tradeoffs that\
    \ must be\n   considered by the designer.\n   REQ-1: Not specific to one scheme\
    \ or country: The SIP indication\n      should support existing and future priority\
    \ schemes.  For example,\n      there are currently at least four priority schemes\
    \ in widespread\n      use: Q.735, also implemented by the U.S.  defense telephone\n\
    \      network (\"DSN\" or \"Autovon\") and NATO, has five levels, the United\n\
    \      States GETS (Government Emergency Telecommunications Systems)\n      scheme\
    \ with implied higher priority and the British Government\n      Telephone Preference\
    \ Scheme (GTPS) system, which provides three\n      priority levels for receipt\
    \ of dial tone.\n      The SIP indication may support these existing CSN priority\
    \ schemes\n      through the use of different namespaces.\n      Private-use namespaces\
    \ may also be useful for certain\n      applications.\n   REQ-2: Independent of\
    \ particular network architecture: The SIP\n      indication should work in the\
    \ widest variety of SIP-based systems.\n      It should not be restricted to particular\
    \ operators or types of\n      networks, such as wireless networks or protocol\
    \ profiles and\n      dialects in certain types of networks.  The originator of\
    \ a SIP\n      request cannot be expected to know what kind of circuit-switched\n\
    \      technology is used by the destination gateway.\n   REQ-3: Invisible to\
    \ network (IP) layer: The SIP indication must\n      be usable in IP networks\
    \ that are unaware of the enhancement and\n      in SIP/RTP-transparent networks.\n\
    \      This requirement can be translated to mean that the request has to\n  \
    \    be a valid SIP request and that out-of-band signaling is not\n      acceptable.\n\
    \   REQ-4: Mapping of existing schemes: Existing CSN schemes must be\n      translatable\
    \ to SIP-based systems.\n   REQ-5: No loss of information: For the CSN-IP-CSN\
    \ case, there\n      should be no loss of signaling information caused by translation\n\
    \      from CSN signaling SIP and back from SIP to CSN signaling if both\n   \
    \   circuit-switched networks use the same priority scheme.  Loss of\n      information\
    \ may be unavoidable if the destination CSN uses a\n      different priority scheme\
    \ from the origin.\n      One cannot assume that both CSNs are using the same\
    \ signaling\n      protocol or protocol version, such as ISUP, so that transporting\n\
    \      ISUP objects in MIME [4,5] is unlikely to be sufficient.\n   REQ-6: Extensibility:\
    \ Any naming scheme specified as part of the\n      SIP indication should allow\
    \ for future expansion.  Expanded naming\n      schemes may be needed as resource\
    \ priority is applied in\n      additional private networks, or if VoIP-specific\
    \ priority schemes\n      are defined.\n   REQ-7: Separation of policy and mechanism:\
    \ The SIP indication\n      should not describe a particular detailed treatment,\
    \ as it is\n      likely that this depends on the nature of the resource and local\n\
    \      policy.  Instead, it should invoke a particular named policy.  As\n   \
    \   an example, instead of specifying that a certain SIP request\n      should\
    \ be granted queueing priority, not cause preemption, but be\n      restricted\
    \ to three-minute sessions, the request invokes a certain\n      named policy\
    \ that may well have those properties in a particular\n      implementation. \
    \ An IP-to-CSN gateway may need to be aware of the\n      specific actions required\
    \ for the policy, but the protocol\n      indication itself should not.\n    \
    \  Even in the CSN, the same MLPP indication may result in different\n      behavior\
    \ for different networks.\n   REQ-8: Method-neutral: The SIP indication chosen\
    \ should work for\n      any SIP method, not just, say, INVITE.\n   REQ-9: Default\
    \ behavior: Network terminals configured to use a\n      priority scheme may occasionally\
    \ end up making calls in a network\n      that does not support such a scheme.\
    \  In those cases, the protocol\n      must support a sensible default behavior\
    \ that treats the call no\n      worse than a call that did not invoke the priority\
    \ scheme.  Some\n      networks may choose to disallow calls unless they have\
    \ a suitable\n      priority marking and appropriate authentication.  This is\
    \ a matter\n      of local policy.\n   REQ-10: Address-neutral: Any address or\
    \ URI scheme may be a\n      valid destination and must be usable with the priority\
    \ scheme.\n      The SIP indication cannot rely on identifying a set of destination\n\
    \      addresses or URI schemes for special treatment.  This requirement\n   \
    \   is motivated by existing ETS systems.  For example, in GETS and\n      similar\
    \ systems, the caller can reach any PSTN destination with\n      increased probability\
    \ of call completion, not just a limited set.\n      (This does not preclude local\
    \ policy that allows or disallows,\n      say, calls to international numbers\
    \ for certain users.)\n      Some schemes may have an open set of destinations,\
    \ such as any\n      valid E.164 number or any valid domestic telephone number,\
    \ while\n      others may only reach a limited set of destinations.\n   REQ-11:\
    \ Identity-independent: The user identity, such as the\n      From header field\
    \ in SIP, is insufficient to identify the priority\n      level of the request.\
    \  The same identity can issue non-prioritized\n      requests as well as prioritized\
    \ ones, with the range of priorities\n      determined by the job function of\
    \ the caller.  The choice of the\n      priority is made based on human judgement,\
    \ following a set of\n      general rules that are likely to be applied by analogy\
    \ rather than\n      precise mapping of each condition.  For example, a particular\n\
    \      circumstance may be considered similarly grave compared to one\n      which\
    \ is listed explicitly.\n   REQ-12: Independent of network location: While some\
    \ existing CSN\n      schemes restrict the set of priorities based on the line\
    \ identity,\n      it is recognized that future IP-based schemes should be flexible\n\
    \      enough to avoid such reliance.  Instead, a combination of\n      authenticated\
    \ user identity, user choice and policy determines the\n      request treatment.\n\
    \   REQ-13: Multiple simultaneous schemes: Some user agents will\n      need to\
    \ support multiple different priority schemes, as several\n      will remain in\
    \ use in networks run by different agencies and\n      operators.  (Not all user\
    \ agents will have the means of\n      authorizing callers using different schemes,\
    \ and thus may be\n      configured at run-time to only recognize certain namespaces.)\n\
    \   REQ-14: Discovery: A terminal should be able to discover which,\n      if\
    \ any, priority namespaces are supported by a network element.\n      Discovery\
    \ may be explicit, where a user agent requests a list of\n      the supported\
    \ namespaces or it may be implicit, where it attempts\n      to use a particular\
    \ namespace and is then told that this namespace\n      is not supported.  This\
    \ does not imply that every element has to\n      support the priority scheme.\
    \  However, entities should be able\n      discover whether a network element\
    \ supports it or not.\n   REQ-15: Testing: It must be possible to test the system\
    \ outside\n      of emergency conditions, to increase the chances that all elements\n\
    \      work during an actual emergency.  In particular, critical elements\n  \
    \    such as indication, authentication, authorization and call routing\n    \
    \  must be testable.  Testing under load is desirable.  Thus, it is\n      desirable\
    \ that the SIP indication is available continuously, not\n      just during emergencies.\n\
    \   REQ-16: 3PCC: The system has to work with SIP third-party call\n      control.\n\
    \   REQ-17: Proxy-visible: Proxies may want to use the indication to\n      influence\
    \ request routing (see Section 7) or impose additional\n      authentication requirements.\n"

    \ to obtain resources and\n   thus deny service to other users.  While the indication\
    \ itself does\n   not have to provide separate authentication, any SIP request\
    \ carrying\n   such information has more rigorous authentication requirements\
    \ than\n   regular requests.  Below, we describe authentication and\n   authorization\
    \ aspects, confidentiality and privacy requirements,\n   protection against denial\
    \ of service attacks and anonymity\n   requirements.  Additional discussion can\
    \ be found in [6].\n"
- title: 10.1 Authentication and Authorization
  contents:
  - "10.1 Authentication and Authorization\n   SEC-1: More rigorous: Prioritized access\
    \ to network and end\n      system resources enumerated in Section 3 imposes particularly\n\
    \      stringent requirements on authentication and authorization\n      mechanisms\
    \ since access to prioritized resources may impact\n      overall system stability\
    \ and performance, not just result in theft\n      of, say, a single phone call.\n\
    \      The authentication and authorization requirements for ETS calls\n     \
    \ are, in particular, much stronger than for emergency calls (112,\n      911),\
    \ where wide access is the design objective, sacrificing\n      caller identification\
    \ if necessary.\n   SEC-2: Attack protection: Under certain emergency conditions,\n\
    \      the network infrastructure, including its authentication and\n      authorization\
    \ mechanism, may be under attack.  Thus,\n      authentication and authorization\
    \ must be able to survive such\n      attacks and defend the resources against\
    \ these attacks.\n      Mechanisms to delegate authentication and to authenticate\
    \ as early\n      as possible are required.  In particular, the number of packets\n\
    \      and the amount of other resources such as computation or storage\n    \
    \  that an unauthorized user can consume needs to be minimized.\n      Unauthorized\
    \ users must not be able to block CSN resources, as\n      they are likely to\
    \ be more scarce than packet resources. This\n      implies that authentication\
    \ and authorization must take place on\n      the IP network side rather than\
    \ using, say, a CSN circuit to\n      authenticate the caller via a DTMF sequence.\n\
    \      Given the urgency during emergency events, normal statistical\n      fraud\
    \ detection may be less effective, thus placing a premium on\n      reliable authentication.\n\
    \      SIP nodes should be able to independently verify the authorization\n  \
    \    of requests to receive prioritized service and not rely on\n      transitive\
    \ trust within the network.\n   SEC-3: Independent of mechanism: Any indication\
    \ of the resource\n      priority must be independent of the authentication mechanism,\n\
    \      since end systems will impose different constraints on the\n      applicable\
    \ authentication mechanisms. For example, some end\n      systems may only allow\
    \ user input via a 12-digit keypad, while\n      others may have the ability to\
    \ acquire biometrics or read\n      smartcards.\n   SEC-4: Non-trusted end systems:\
    \ Since ETS users may use devices\n      that are not their own, systems should\
    \ support authentication\n      mechanisms that do not require the user to reveal\
    \ her secret, such\n      as a PIN or password, to the device.\n   SEC-5: Replay:\
    \ The authentication mechanisms must be resistant\n      to replay attacks.\n\
    \   SEC-6: Cut-and-paste: The authentication mechanisms must be\n      resistant\
    \ to cut-and-paste attacks.\n   SEC-7: Bid-down: The authentication mechanisms\
    \ must be resistant\n      to bid down attacks.\n"
