  contents:
  - "Abstract\n   RFC 3966 explicitly states that 'tel' URIs may not represent a dial\n\
    \   string.  That leaves no way specify a dial string in a standardized\n   way.\
    \  Great confusion exists with the SIP URI parameter \"user=phone\",\n   and specifically,\
    \ if it can represent a dial string.  This memo\n   creates a new value for the\
    \ user parameter \"dialstring\", so that one\n   may specify \"user=dialstring\"\
    \ to encode a dial string as a 'sip:' or\n   'sips:' URI.\n"

- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   A user at a phone often has a limited User Interface, and\
    \ in some\n   cases, is limited to a 10 key pad (and sometimes a \"flash\" function\n\
    \   with the switchhook).  The user enters a series of digits that invoke\n  \
    \ some kind of function.  The entered sequence, called a \"dial string\",\n  \
    \ may be translated to a telephone number, or it may invoke a special\n   service.\
    \  In many newer designs, the mapping between a dial string\n   and a phone number\
    \ or service URI is contained within the phone\n   (digitmap).  However, there\
    \ are many phones and terminal adapters\n   that do not have internal translation\
    \ mechanisms.  Without a\n   translation mechanism in the phone, the phone must\
    \ send the dial\n   string in a 'sip:' or 'sips:' URI [RFC3261] to an intermediary\
    \ that\n   can transform the dial string to a phone number or a service\n   invocation.\
    \  The intermediary is able to perform this transform\n   provided that it knows\
    \ the context (i.e., dialing plan) within which\n   the number was dialed.\n \
    \  There is a problem here.  The intermediary can apply its\n   transformation\
    \ only if it recognizes that the user part of the SIP\n   URI is a dial string.\
    \  However, there is currently no way to\n   distinguish a user part consisting\
    \ of a dial string from a user part\n   that happens to be composed of characters\
    \ that would appear in a dial\n   string.\n   Use of DTMF (dual tone multi-frequency)\
    \ detectors after the initial\n   number has been dialed is not uncommon.  A common\
    \ function some\n   systems have is to express a string that incorporates fixed\
    \ time\n   delays, or in some cases, an actual \"wait for call completion\" after\n\
    \   which additional DTMF signals are emitted.  For example, many\n   voicemail\
    \ systems use a common phone number, after which the system\n   expects the desired\
    \ mailbox number as a series of DTMF digits to\n   deposit a message for.  Many\
    \ gateways have the ability to interpret\n   such strings, but there is no standardized\
    \ way to express them,\n   leading to interoperability problems between endpoints.\
    \  This is\n   another case where the ability to indicate that a dial string is\n\
    \   being presented would be useful.\n"

    , \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and\

    \   It is assumed that the reader is familiar with the terminology and\n   acronyms\
    \ defined in [RFC3261].\n"
- title: 3.  Requirements
  contents:
  - "3.  Requirements\n   A mechanism to express a dial string in a 'sip:' or 'sips:'\
    \ URI is\n   required.  A dial string consists of a sequence of\n   *  the digits\
    \ 0-9\n   *  the special characters # and *\n   *  the DTMF digits A-D\n   * \
    \ characters representing a short pause, and a \"Wait for call\n      completion\"\
    \ in a dial string\n   Note: DTMF = dual tone multi-frequency.  Each \"tone:\"\
    \ is actually two\n   frequencies superimposed.  DTMF is a 4 x 4 matrix with four\
    \ row\n   frequencies (697, 770, 852, 941 Hz) and four column frequencies\n  \
    \ (1209, 1336, 1477, 1633).  Most telephones only implement 3 of the 4\n   columns,\
    \ which are used just as the telephone dial pad implies.\n   Thus, the digit 2\
    \ is the first row, second column, and consists of\n   770Hz and 1209Hz frequencies\
    \ mixed together.  The fourth column is\n   not used in the PSTN (Public Switched\
    \ Telephone Network).  The\n   \"digits\" for the fourth column are usually expressed\
    \ using the\n   letters A through D.  Thus, \"C\" is 852/1633Hz.  Some systems\
    \ do use\n   these digits, so we include them in the definition of the dial\n\
    \   string.\n   A dial string always exists within a context.  The context MUST\
    \ be\n   specified when expressing a dial string.\n   It MUST be possible to distinguish\
    \ between a dial string and a user\n   part that happens to consist of the same\
    \ characters.\n"
- title: 4.  Solution
  contents:
  - "4.  Solution\n   A new alternative value for the \"userinfo\" parameter of the\
    \ 'sip:' or\n   'sips:' URI schemes is defined, \"dialstring\".  This value may\
    \ be used\n   in a 'sip:' or 'sips:' URI when the user part is a dial string.\
    \  The\n   dial string is a sequence of the characters 0-9, A-F, P, X, '*' and\n\
    \   '#'.  E represents *, F represents #, P is a pause (short wait, like\n   a\
    \ comma in a modem string) and X represents \"wait for call\n   completion\".\n\
    \   When the \"user=dialstring\" is used, a context parameter, as defined\n  \
    \ in [RFC3966], MUST be specified.  The context parameter would\n   normally be\
    \ a domain name.  The domain name does not have to resolve\n   to any actual host\
    \ but MUST be under the administrative control of\n   the entity managing the\
    \ local phone context.  The context parameter\n   value is normally configured\
    \ in the user agent.\n   The syntax of the context parameter follows the same\
    \ conventions as\n   the same parameter in [RFC3966], that is, it appears between\
    \ the\n   digits and the \"@\" in the userinfo [RFC3261] of the URI:\n       dialstring\
    \ = dialstring-digits context; context from RFC 3966\n       dialstring-digits\
    \ = *dialstring-element dialstring-digit\n                  *dialstring-element\n\
    \       dialstring-digit = HEXDIG / \"*\" / \"#\"; HEXDIG from RFC 3966\n    \
    \   dialstring-element =  dialstring-digit  / \"P\" / \"X\" /\n              \
    \    visual-separator; visual-separator from RFC 3966\n   A dial string SHOULD\
    \ NOT be used for an AoR (Address of Record) in a\n   REGISTER.  Parameters are\
    \ ignored in registration.  Thus, two\n   registrations with different phone-contexts\
    \ would be considered\n   equivalent, which is probably not desirable.\n   A proxy\
    \ server or Back to Back User Agent (B2BUA) [RFC3261], which is\n   authoritative\
    \ for the context, may translate the dial string to a\n   telephone number or\
    \ service invocation URI.  The telephone number MAY\n   be expressed as a global\
    \ or local tel: URI, or it MAY be left as a\n   sip: or sips: URI with the URI\
    \ parameter value changed from \"user= \"\n   to \"user=phone\".\n   Examples\
    \ of dial string use include:\n   ;what a SIP Phone might emit when a user dials\
    \ extension 123\n"

    \   systems.  Dial strings normally SHOULD NOT be sent beyond the domain\n   of\
    \ the UAC (User Agent Client).  If they are sent across the\n   Internet, they\
    \ SHOULD be protected against eavesdropping with TLS\n   (Transport Layer Security)\
