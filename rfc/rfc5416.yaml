  - "1.  Introduction\n   The CAPWAP protocol [RFC5415] defines an extensible protocol
    to allow\n   an Access Controller to manage wireless agnostic Wireless Termination\n
    \  Points.  The CAPWAP protocol itself does not include any specific\n   wireless
    technologies; instead, it relies on a binding specification\n   to extend the
    technology to a particular wireless technology.\n   This specification defines
    the Control And Provisioning of Wireless\n   Access Points (CAPWAP) Protocol Binding
    Specification for use with\n   the IEEE 802.11 Wireless Local Area Network protocol.
    \ Use of CAPWAP\n   control message fields, new control messages, and message
    elements\n   are defined.  The minimum required definitions for a binding-specific\n
    \  Statistics message element, Station message element, and WTP Radio\n   Information
    message element are included.\n   Note that this binding only supports the IEEE
    802.11-2007\n   specification.  Of note, this binding does not support the ad
    hoc\n   network mode defined in the IEEE 802.11-2007 standard.  This\n   specification
    also does not cover the use of data frames with the\n   four-address format, commonly
    referred to as Wireless Bridges, whose\n   use is not specified in the IEEE 802.11-2007
    standard.  This protocol\n   specification does not currently officially support
    IEEE 802.11n.\n   That said, the protocol does allow a WTP to advertise support
    for an\n   IEEE 802.11n radio; however, the protocol does not allow for any of\n
    \  the protocol's additional features to be configured and/or used.  New\n   IEEE
    protocol specifications published outside of this document\n   (e.g., IEEE 802.11v,
    IEEE 802.11r) are also not supported through\n   this binding, and in addition
    to IEEE 802.11n, must be addressed\n   either through a separate CAPWAP binding,
    or an update to this\n   binding.\n   In order to address immediate market needs
    for standards still being\n   developed by the IEEE 802.11 standards body, the
    WiFi Alliance\n   created interim pseudo-standards specifications.  Two such\n
    \  specifications are widely used in the industry, namely the WiFi\n   Protect
    Access [WPA] and the WiFi MultiMedia [WMM] specifications.\n   Given their widespread
    adoption, this CAPWAP binding requires the use\n   of these two specifications.\n"
  - contents:
    - "1.1.  Goals\n   The goals of this CAPWAP protocol binding are to make the\n
      \  capabilities of the CAPWAP protocol available for use in conjunction\n   with
      IEEE 802.11 wireless networks.  The capabilities to be made\n   available can
      be summarized as:\n   1. To centralize the authentication and policy enforcement
      functions\n      for an IEEE 802.11 wireless network.  The AC may also provide\n
      \     centralized bridging, forwarding, and encryption of user traffic.\n      Centralization
      of these functions will enable reduced cost and\n      higher efficiency by
      applying the capabilities of network\n      processing silicon to the wireless
      network, as in wired LANs.\n   2. To enable shifting of the higher-level protocol
      processing from\n      the WTP.  This leaves the time-critical applications
      of wireless\n      control and access in the WTP, making efficient use of the\n
      \     computing power available in WTPs that are subject to severe cost\n      pressure.\n
      \  The CAPWAP protocol binding extensions defined herein apply solely to\n   the
      interface between the WTP and the AC.  Inter-AC and station-to-AC\n   communication
      are strictly outside the scope of this document.\n"

      \  throughout this document.  However, many additional definitions can\n   be
      found in [IEEE.802-11.2007].\n   Access Controller (AC): The network entity
      that provides WTP access\n   to the network infrastructure in the data plane,
      control plane,\n   management plane, or a combination therein.\n   Basic Service
      Set (BSS): A set of stations controlled by a single\n   coordination function.\n
      \  Distribution: The service that, by using association information,\n   delivers
      medium access control (MAC) service data units (MSDUs)\n   within the distribution
      system (DS).\n   Distribution System Service (DSS): The set of services provided
      by\n   the distribution system (DS) that enable the medium access control\n
      \  (MAC) layer to transport MAC service data units (MSDUs) between\n   stations
      that are not in direct communication with each other over a\n   single instance
      of the wireless medium (WM).  These services include\n   the transport of MSDUs
      between the access points (APs) of basic\n   service sets (BSSs) within an extended
      service set (ESS), transport\n   of MSDUs between portals and BSSs within an
      ESS, and transport of\n   MSDUs between stations in the same BSS in cases where
      the MSDU has a\n   multicast or broadcast destination address, or where the
      destination\n   is an individual address but the station sending the MSDU chooses
      to\n   involve the DSS.  DSSs are provided between pairs of IEEE 802.11\n   MACs.\n
      \  Integration: The service that enables delivery of medium access\n   control
      (MAC) service data units (MSDUs) between the distribution\n   system (DS) and
      an existing, non-IEEE 802.11 local area network (via\n   a portal).\n   Station
      (STA): A device that contains an IEEE 802.11 conformant\n   medium access control
      (MAC) and physical layer (PHY) interface to the\n   wireless medium (WM).\n
      \  Portal: The logical point at which medium access control (MAC)\n   service
      data units (MSDUs) from a non-IEEE 802.11 local area network\n   (LAN) enter
      the distribution system (DS) of an extended service set\n   (ESS).\n   WLAN:
      In this document, WLAN refers to a logical component\n   instantiated on a WTP
      device.  A single physical WTP may operate a\n   number of WLANs.  Each Basic
      Service Set Identifier (BSSID) and its\n   constituent wireless terminal radios
      is denoted as a distinct WLAN on\n   a physical WTP.\n   Wireless Termination
      Point (WTP): The physical or network entity that\n   contains an IEEE 802.11
      RF antenna and wireless PHY to transmit and\n   receive station traffic for
      wireless access networks.\n"

        Architecture, the Distribution and Integration\n   services reside on the

        \ As noted above, all real-time IEEE\n   802.11 services, including the Beacon
        and Probe Response frames, are\n   handled on the WTP.\n   All remaining IEEE
        802.11 MAC management frames are supported on the\n   AC, including the Association
        Request frame that allows the AC to be\n   involved in the access policy enforcement
        portion of the IEEE 802.11\n   protocol.  The IEEE 802.1X [IEEE.802-1X.2004],

        \  Network Association (RSNA) Key Management [IEEE.802-11.2007]\n   functions
        are also located on the AC.  This implies that the\n   Authentication, Authorization,
        and Accounting (AAA) client also\n   resides on the AC.\n   While the admission
        control component of IEEE 802.11 resides on the\n   AC, the real-time scheduling

        Flow\n   Figure 2 provides an illustration of the division of labor in a Split\n
        \  MAC architecture.  In this example, a WLAN has been created that is\n   configured
        for IEEE 802.11, using 802.1X-based end user\n   authentication and Advanced
        Encryption Standard-Counter Mode with\n   CBC-MAC Protocol (AES-CCMP) link
        layer encryption (CCMP, see\n   [FIPS.197.2001]).  The following process occurs:\n
        \  o  The WTP generates the IEEE 802.11 Beacon frames, using information\n
        \     provided to it through the IEEE 802.11 Add WLAN (see Section 6.1)\n
        \     message element, including the Robust Security Network Information\n
        \     Element (RSNIE), which indicates support of 802.1X and AES-CCMP.\n   o
        \ The WTP processes the Probe Request frame and responds with a\n      corresponding
        Probe Response frame.  The Probe Request frame is\n      then forwarded to
        the AC for optional processing.\n   o  The WTP forwards the IEEEE 802.11 Authentication
        and Association\n      frames to the AC, which is responsible for responding
        to the\n      client.\n   o  Once the association is complete, the AC transmits
        a Station\n      Configuration Request message, which includes an Add Station\n
        \     message element, to the WTP (see Section 4.6.8 in [RFC5415]).  In\n
        \     the above example, the WLAN was configured for IEEE 802.1X, and\n      therefore
        the IEEE 802.11 Station Session Key is included with the\n      flag field's
        'A' bit set.\n   o  If the WTP is providing encryption/decryption services,
        once the\n      client has completed the IEEE 802.11 key exchange, the AC\n
        \     transmits another Station Configuration Request message, which\n      includes:\n
        \     -  An Add Station message element.\n      -  An IEEE 802.11 Add Station
        message element, which includes the\n         WLAN Identifier with which the
        station has associated.\n      -  An IEEE 802.11 Station Session Key message
        element, which\n         includes the pairwise encryption key.\n      -  An
        IEEE 802.11 Information Element message element, which\n         includes
        the Robust Security Network Information Element\n         (RSNIE) to the WTP,
        stating the security policy to enforce for\n         the client (in this case
        AES-CCMP).\n   o  If the WTP is providing encryption/decryption services,
        once the\n      client has completed the IEEE 802.11 key exchange, the AC\n
        \     transmits another Station Configuration Request message, which\n      includes:\n
        \     -  An Add Station message element.\n      -  An IEEE 802.11 Add Station
        message element, which includes the\n         WLAN Identifier with which the
        station has associated.\n      -  An IEEE 802.11 Station Session Key message
        element, which\n         includes the pairwise encryption key.\n      -  An
        IEEE 802.11 Information Element message element, which\n         includes
        the Robust Security Network Information Element\n         (RSNIE) to the WTP,
        stating the security policy to enforce for\n         the client (in this case
        AES-CCMP).\n   o  If the AC is providing encryption/decryption services, once
        the\n      client has completed the IEEE 802.11 key exchange, the AC\n      transmits
        another Station Configuration Request message, which\n      includes:\n      -
        \ An Add Station message element.\n      -  An IEEE 802.11 Add Station message
        element, which includes the\n         WLAN Identifier with which the station
        has associated.\n      -  An IEEE 802.11 Station Session Key message element
        with the\n         flag field's 'C' bit enabled (indicating that the AC will\n
        \        provide crypto services).\n   o  The WTP forwards any IEEE 802.11
        Management Action frames received\n      to the AC.\n   o  All IEEE 802.11
        station data frames are tunneled between the WTP\n      and the AC.\n   Note
        that during the EAP over LAN (EAPOL)-Key exchange between the\n   Station
        and the AC, the Receive Sequence Counter (RSC) field for the\n   Group Key
        (GTK) needs to be included in the frame.  The value of zero\n   (0) is used
        by the AC during this exchange.  Additional details are\n   available in Section
        9.1.\n   The WTP SHALL include the IEEE 802.11 MAC header contents in all\n
        \  frames transmitted to the AC.\n   When 802.11 encryption/decryption is
        performed at the WTP, the WTP\n   MUST decrypt the uplink frames, MUST set
        the Protected Frame field to\n   0, and MUST make the frame format consistent
        with that of an\n   unprotected 802.11 frame prior to transmitting the frames
        to the AC.\n   The fields added to an 802.11 protected frame (i.e., Initialization\n
        \  Vector/Extended Initialization Vector (IV/EIV), Message Integrity\n   Code
        (MIC), and Integrity Check Value (ICV)) MUST be stripped off\n   prior to
        transmission from the WTP to AC.  For downlink frames, the\n   Protected Frame
        field MUST be set to 0 by the AC as the frame being\n   sent is unencrypted.
        \ The WTP MUST apply the required protection\n   policy for the WLAN, and
        set the Protected Frame field on\n   transmission over the air.  The Protected
        Frame field always needs to\n   accurately indicate the status of the 802.11
        frame that is carrying\n   it.\n   When 802.11 encryption/decryption is performed
        at the AC, the WTP\n   SHALL NOT decrypt the uplink frames prior to transmitting
        the frames\n   to the AC.  The AC and WTP SHALL populate the IEEE 802.11 MAC
        header\n   fields as described in Figure 3.\n           MAC header field        Location\n

        (FCS) field is not included in 802.11 frames exchanged\n   between the WTP
        and the AC.  Upon sending data frames to the AC, the\n   WTP is responsible
        for validating and stripping the FCS field.  Upon\n   receiving data frames
        from the AC, the WTP is responsible for adding\n   the FCS field, and populating
        the field as described in\n   [IEEE.802-11.2007].\n   Note that when the WTP
        tunnels data packets to the AC (and vice\n   versa), the CAPWAP protocol does
        not guarantee in-order delivery.\n   When the protocol being transported over
        IEEE 802.11 is IP, out-of-\n   order delivery is not an issue as IP has no
        such requirements.\n   However, implementers need to be aware of this protocol\n
        \  characteristic before deciding to use CAPWAP.\n"

        Request frames to the AC.  The AC\n   MAY reply with a failed Association
        Response frame if it deems it\n   necessary, and upon receipt of a failed

    - contents:
      - "2.6.1.  IEEE 802.11 Data Frames\n   When the WLAN is created on the WTP,
        a default Quality of Service\n   policy is established through the IEEE 802.11
        WTP Quality of Service\n   message element (see Section 6.22).  This default
        policy will cause\n   the WTP to use the default QoS values for any station
        associated with\n   the WLAN in question.  The AC MAY also override the policy
        for a\n   given station by sending the IEEE 802.11 Update Station QoS message\n
        \  element (see Section 6.20), known as a station-specific QoS policy.\n   Beyond
        the default, and per station QoS policy, the IEEE 802.11\n   protocol also
        allows a station to request special QoS treatment for a\n   specific flow
        through the Traffic Specification (TSPEC) Information\n   Elements found in
        the IEEE 802.11-2007's QoS Action Frame.\n   Alternatively, stations MAY also
        use the WiFi Alliance's WMM\n   specification instead to request QoS treatment
        for a flow (see\n   [WMM]).  This requires the WTP to observe the Status Code

        the type of QoS to be used by the WTP.  The first is the\n   'P' bit, which
        is set to inform the WTP it is to use the 802.1p QoS\n   mechanism.  When
        set, the 'Q' bit is used to inform the WTP which\n   802.1p priority values
        it is to use.\n   The 'D' bit is set to inform the WTP it is to use the Differentiated\n
        \  Services Code Point (DSCP) QoS mechanism.  When set, the 'I' and 'O'\n
        \  bits are used to inform the WTP which values it is to use in the\n   inner

        priority or DSCP values may change for a\n   given station, known as the station
        specific policy, the original\n   Tagging Policy (the use of the five bits)
        remains the same.\n   The use of the DSCP and 802.1p QoS mechanisms are not

          the priority field set\n   according to the policy provided.  Note that

          which is used by the\n   WTP when the 'D' bit is set to mark the DSCP field
          of both the IPv4\n   and IPv6 headers (see [RFC2474]).  When DSCP is used,
          the WTP marks\n   the inner packet (the original packet received by the

          packet\n   (tunnel header's DSCP field) when the 'O' bit is set.\n   When
          the 'D' bit is set, the treatment of the packet differs based on\n   whether
          the WTP is tunneling the station's packets to the AC.\n   Tunneling does

          (added by the WTP).  In this\n   mode of operation, the bits are treated

          \         field, in which case it uses the behavior described when the\n
          \         'O' bit is set.  This occurs also if the inner packet is not\n
          \         IPv4 or IPv6, and thus does not have a DSCP field.\n   I=1:   The

          \ If encryption services are provided by the AC (see\n          Section

          the inner DSCP field, in which case it uses the\n          behavior described
          when the 'I' bit is not set.  This occurs\n          also if the inner packet

      by the WTP.  This control\n   message is used to either create, update, or delete
      a WLAN on the\n   WTP.\n   The IEEE 802.11 WLAN Configuration Request is sent
      as a result of\n   either some manual administrative process (e.g., deleting
      a WLAN), or\n   automatically to create a WLAN on a WTP.  When sent automatically
      to\n   create a WLAN, this control message is sent after the CAPWAP\n   Configuration
      Update Response message (see Section 8.5 in [RFC5415])\n   has been received
      by the AC.\n   Upon receiving this control message, the WTP will modify the\n
      \  necessary services and transmit an IEEE 802.11 WLAN Configuration\n   Response.\n
      \  A WTP MAY provide service for more than one WLAN; therefore, every\n   WLAN
      is identified through a numerical index.  For instance, a WTP\n   that is capable
      of supporting up to 16 Service Set Identifiers\n   (SSIDs), could accept up
      to 16 IEEE 802.11 WLAN Configuration Request\n   messages that include the Add
      WLAN message element.\n   Since the index is the primary identifier for a WLAN,
      an AC MAY\n   attempt to ensure that the same WLAN is identified through the
      same\n   index number on all of its WTPs.  An AC that does not follow this\n
      \  approach MUST find some other means of maintaining a WLAN-Identifier-\n   to-SSID
      mapping table.\n   The following message elements MAY be included in the IEEE
      802.11\n   WLAN Configuration Request message.  Only one message element MUST
      be\n   present.\n   o  IEEE 802.11 Add WLAN, see Section 6.1\n   o  IEEE 802.11

  - "4.  CAPWAP Data Message Bindings\n   This section describes the CAPWAP data message
    bindings to support\n   transport of IEEE 802.11 frames.\n   Payload encapsulation:
    \ The CAPWAP protocol defines the CAPWAP data\n      message, which is used to
    encapsulate a wireless payload.  For\n      IEEE 802.11, the IEEE 802.11 header
    and payload are encapsulated\n      (excluding the IEEE 802.11 FCS checksum).
    \ The IEEE 802.11 FCS\n      checksum is handled by the WTP.  This allows the
    WTP to validate\n      an IEEE 802.11 frame prior to sending it to the AC.  Similarly,\n
    \     when an AC wishes to transmit a frame to a station, the WTP\n      computes
    and adds the FCS checksum.\n   Optional Wireless Specific Information:  This optional
    CAPWAP header\n      field (see Section 4.3 in [RFC5415]) is only used with CAPWAP
    data\n      messages, and it serves two purposes, depending upon the direction\n
    \     of the message.  For messages from the WTP to the AC, the field\n      uses
    the format described in the \"IEEE 802.11 Frame Info\" field\n      (see below).
    \ However, for messages sent by the AC to the WTP, the\n      format used is described
    in the \"Destination WLANs\" field (also\n      defined below).\n      Note that
    in both cases, the two optional headers fit in the\n      \"Data\" field of the
    Wireless Specific Information header.\n   IEEE 802.11 Frame Info:  When an IEEE
    802.11 frame is received from a\n      station over the air, it is encapsulated
    and this field is used to\n      include radio and PHY-specific information associated
    with the\n      frame.\n      The IEEE 802.11 Frame Info field has the following
    format:\n      0                   1                   2                   3\n
    \     0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1\n     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+\n
    \    |     RSSI      |     SNR       |           Data Rate           |\n     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+\n
    \     RSSI:   Received Signal Strength Indication (RSSI) is a signed,\n         8-bit
    value.  It is the received signal strength indication, in\n         dBm.\n      SNR:
    \  SNR is a signed, 8-bit value.  It is the signal-to-noise\n         ratio of
    the received IEEE 802.11 frame, in dB.\n      Data Rate:   The data rate field
    is a 16-bit unsigned value.  The\n         data rate field is a 16-bit unsigned
    value expressing the data\n         rate of the packets received by the WTP in
    units of 0.1 Mbps.\n         For instance, a packet received at 5.5 Mbps would
    be set to 55,\n         while 11 Mbps would be set to 110.\n   Destination WLANs:
    \ The Destination WLANs field is used to specify\n      the target WLANs for a
    given frame, and is only used with\n      broadcast and multicast frames.  This
    field allows the AC to\n      transmit a single broadcast or multicast frame to
    the WTP and\n      allows the WTP to perform the necessary frame replication.
    \ The\n      field uses the following format:\n      0                   1                   2
    \                  3\n      0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4

    \     WLAN ID bitmap:   This bit field indicates the WLAN ID (see\n         Section
    6.1) on which the WTP will transmit the included frame.\n         For instance,
    if a multicast packet is to be transmitted on\n         WLANs 1 and 3, the bits
    for WLAN 1 and 3 of this field would be\n         enabled.  WLAN 1 is represented
    by bit 15 in the figure above,\n         or the least significant bit, while WLAN
    16 would be\n         represented by bit zero (0), or the most significant bit,
    in\n         the figure.  This field is to be set to all zeroes for unicast\n
    \        packets and is unused if the WTP is not providing IEEE 802.11\n         encryption.\n
    \     Reserved:   All implementations complying with this protocol MUST\n         set
    to zero any bits that are reserved in the version of the\n         protocol supported
    by that implementation.  Receivers MUST\n         ignore all bits not defined
    for the version of the protocol\n         they support.\n"

      the key usage and its status:\n      0 -  A value of zero, with the inclusion
      of the RSN Information\n           Element means that the WLAN uses per-station
      encryption keys,\n           and therefore the key in the 'Key' field is only
      used for\n           multicast traffic.\n      1 -  When set to one, the WLAN
      employs a shared Wired Equivalent\n           Privacy (WEP) key, also known
      as a static WEP key, and uses\n           the encryption key for both unicast
      and multicast traffic for\n           all stations.\n      2 -  The value of
      2 indicates that the AC will begin rekeying the\n           GTK with the STA's
      in the BSS.  It is only valid when IEEE\n           802.11 is enabled as the
      security policy for the BSS.\n      3 -  The value of 3 indicates that the AC
      has completed rekeying\n           the GTK and broadcast packets no longer need
      to be duplicated\n           and transmitted with both GTK's.\n   Key Length:
      \  A 16-bit value representing the length of the Key\n      field.\n   Key:
      \  A Session Key, whose length is known via the Key Length field,\n      used

      encryption key for unicast and multicast traffic, the\n      key included here
      only applies to multicast frames, and the cipher\n      suite is specified in

      message element,\n      see Section 6.15.  When used with WEP, the key field
      includes the\n      broadcast key.  When used with CCMP, the Key field includes
      the\n      128-bit Group Temporal Key.  When used with TKIP, the Key field\n
      \     includes the 256-bit Group Temporal Key (which consists of a 128-\n      bit

      \  Group TSC:   A 48-bit value containing the Transmit Sequence Counter\n      (TSC)
      for the updated group key.  The WTP will set the TSC for\n      broadcast/multicast
      frames to this value for the updated group\n      key.\n   QoS:   An 8-bit value
      specifying the default QoS policy for the WTP\n      to apply to network traffic
      received for a non-WMM enabled STA.\n      The following enumerated values are

      \ Open System\n      1 -  WEP Shared Key\n   MAC Mode:   This field specifies
      whether the WTP should support the\n      WLAN in Local or Split MAC mode.  Note
      that the AC MUST NOT\n      request a mode of operation that was not advertised
      by the WTP\n      during the discovery process (see Section 4.6.43 in [RFC5415]).\n
      \     The following enumerated values are supported:\n      0 - Local MAC:   Service
      for the WLAN is to be provided in Local\n         MAC mode.\n      1 - Split
      MAC:   Service for the WLAN is to be provided in Split\n         MAC mode.\n
      \  Tunnel Mode:   This field specifies the frame tunneling type to be\n      used
      for 802.11 data frames from all stations associated with the\n      WLAN.  The
      AC MUST NOT request a mode of operation that was not\n      advertised by the
      WTP during the discovery process (see Section\n      4.6.42 in [RFC5415]).  All
      IEEE 802.11 management frames MUST be\n      tunneled using 802.11 Tunnel mode.
      \ The following enumerated\n      values are supported:\n      0 - Local Bridging:
      \  All user traffic is to be locally bridged.\n      1 - 802.3 Tunnel:   All
      user traffic is to be tunneled to the AC\n         in 802.3 format (see Section
      4.4.2 in [RFC5415]).  Note that\n         this option MUST NOT be selected with
      Split MAC mode.\n      2 - 802.11 Tunnel:   All user traffic is to be tunneled
      to the AC\n         in 802.11 format.\n   Suppress SSID:   A boolean indicating
      whether the SSID is to be\n      advertised by the WTP.  A value of zero suppresses
      the SSID in the\n      802.11 Beacon and Probe Response frames, while a value
      of one will\n      cause the WTP to populate the field.\n   SSID:   The SSID
      attribute is the service set identifier that will be\n      advertised by the
      WTP for this WLAN.  The SSID field contains any\n      ASCII character and MUST
      NOT exceed 32 octets in length, as\n      defined in [IEEE.802-11.2007].\n"

      \  Element's Encryption Capabilities field (see Section 8.1).\n   When the Key
      field is non-zero in length, the RSN Information Element\n   MUST be sent along
      with the IEEE 802.11 Station Session Key in order\n   to instruct the WTP on
      the usage of the Key field.  The WTP MUST\n   observe the Authentication and
      Key Management (AKM) field of the RSN\n   Information Element in order to identify
      the authentication protocol\n   to be enforced with the station.\n   If cryptographic
      services are provided at the WTP, the WTP MUST\n   observe the algorithm dictated
      in the Pairwise Cipher Suite field of\n   the RSN Information Element sent by
      the AC.  The RSN Information\n   Element included here is the one sent by the
      AC in the third message\n   of the 4-Way Key Handshake, which specifies which

      encryption key (note, this is used\n      when WEP is used in conjunction with
      802.1X, and therefore a\n      unicast encryption key exists).  When used with
      CCMP, the Key\n      field includes the 128-bit Temporal Key.  When used with
      TKIP, the\n      Key field includes the 256-bit Temporal Key (which consists

      traffic.\n      1 -  When set to one, the WLAN employs a shared WEP key, also\n
      \          known as a static WEP key, and uses the encryption key for\n           both
      unicast and multicast traffic for all stations.\n      2 -  The value of 2 indicates
      that the AC will begin rekeying the\n           GTK with the STA's in the BSS.
      \ It is only valid when IEEE\n           802.11 is enabled as the security policy
      for the BSS.\n      3 -  The value of 3 indicates that the AC has completed
      rekeying\n           the GTK and broadcast packets no longer need to be duplicated\n
      \          and transmitted with both GTK's.\n   Key Length:   A 16-bit value
      representing the length of the Key\n      field.\n   Key:   A Session Key, whose
      length is known via the Key Length field,\n      used to provide data privacy.
      \ For static WEP keys, which is true\n      when the 'Key Status' bit is set
      to one, this key is used for both\n      unicast and multicast traffic.  For
      encryption schemes that employ\n      a separate encryption key for unicast
      and multicast traffic, the\n      key included here only applies to multicast
      data, and the cipher\n      suite is specified in an accompanied RSN Information
      Element.  In\n      these scenarios, the key, and cipher information, is communicated\n
      \     via the Add Station message element, see Section 4.6.8 in\n      [RFC5415].
      \ When used with WEP, the Key field includes the\n      broadcast key.  When
      used with CCMP, the Key field includes the\n      128-bit Group Temporal Key.
      \ When used with TKIP, the Key field\n      includes the 256-bit Group Temporal
      Key (which consists of a 128-\n      bit key used as input for TKIP key mixing,
      and two 64-bit keys\n      used for Michael).\n"

    - "9.1.  IEEE 802.11 Security\n   When used with an IEEE 802.11 infrastructure
      with WEP encryption, the\n   CAPWAP protocol does not add any new vulnerabilities.
      \ Derived\n   Session Keys between the STA and WTP can be compromised, resulting
      in\n   many well-documented attacks.  Implementers SHOULD discourage the use\n
      \  of WEP and encourage the use of technically-sound cryptographic\n   solutions
      such as those in an IEEE 802.11 RSN.\n   STA authentication is performed using
      IEEE 802.lX, and consequently\n   EAP.  Implementers SHOULD use EAP methods
      meeting the requirements\n   specified [RFC4017].\n   When used with IEEE 802.11
      RSN security, the CAPWAP protocol may\n   introduce new vulnerabilities, depending
      on whether the link security\n   (packet encryption and integrity verification)
      is provided by the WTP\n   or the AC.  When the link security function is provided
      by the AC, no\n   new security concerns are introduced.\n   However, when the
      WTP provides link security, a new vulnerability\n   will exist when the following
      conditions are true:\n   o  The client is not the first to associate to the
      WTP/ESSID (i.e.,\n      other clients are associated), a GTK already exists,
      and\n   o  traffic has been broadcast under the existing GTK.\n   Under these
      circumstances, the receive sequence counter (KeyRSC)\n   associated with the
      GTK is non-zero, but because the AC anchors the\n   4-way handshake with the
      client, the exact value of the KeyRSC is not\n   known when the AC constructs
      the message containing the GTK.  The\n   client will update its Key RSC value
      to the current valid KeyRSC upon\n   receipt of a valid multicast/broadcast
      message, but prior to this,\n   previous multicast/broadcast traffic that was
      secured with the\n   existing GTK may be replayed, and the client will accept
      this traffic\n   as valid.\n   Typically, busy networks will produce numerous
      multicast or broadcast\n   frames per second, so the window of opportunity with
      respect to such\n   replay is expected to be very small.  In most conditions,
      it is\n   expected that replayed frames could be detected (and logged) by the\n
      \  WTP.\n   The only way to completely close this window is to provide the exact\n
      \  KeyRSC value in message 3 of the 4-way handshake; any other approach\n   simply
      narrows the window to varying degrees.  Given the low relative\n   threat level
      this presents, the additional complexity introduced by\n   providing the exact
      KeyRSC value is not warranted.  That is, this\n   specification provides for
      a calculated risk in this regard.\n   The AC SHOULD use an RSC of 0 when computing
      message-3 of the 4-way\n   802.11i handshake, unless the AC has knowledge of
      a more optimal RSC\n   value to use.  Mechanisms for determining a more optimal
      RSC value\n   are outside the scope of this specification.\n"
