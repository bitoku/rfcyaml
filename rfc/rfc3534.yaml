  - "Abstract\n   The Ogg Bitstream Format aims at becoming a general, freely-available\n\
    \   standard for transporting multimedia content across computing\n   platforms\
    \ and networks.  The intention of this document is to define\n   the MIME media\
    \ type application/ogg to refer to this kind of content\n   when transported across\
    \ the Internet.  It is the intention of the Ogg\n   Bitstream Format developers\
    \ that it be usable without intellectual\n   property concerns.\n"

- title: 1. The Ogg Bitstream Format
  contents:
  - "1. The Ogg Bitstream Format\n   The Ogg Bitstream format has been developed as\
    \ a part of a larger\n   project aimed at creating a set of components for the\
    \ coding and\n   decoding of multimedia content (codecs) which are to be freely\n\
    \   available and freely re-implementable both in software and in\n   hardware\
    \ for the computing community at large, including the Internet\n   community.\n\
    \   Raw packets from these codecs may be used directly by transport\n   mechanisms\
    \ that provide their own framing and packet-separation\n   mechanisms (such as\
    \ UDP datagrams).\n   One such framing and content-separation mechanism is the\
    \ real-time\n   transport protocol (RTP).  RTP allows the streaming of synchronous\n\
    \   lossy data for broadcasting and similar purposes.  If this function\n   is\
    \ desired then a separate RTP wrapping mechanism should be used.  A\n   wrapping\
    \ mechanism is currently under development.\n   For stream based storage (such\
    \ as files) and transport (such as TCP\n   streams or pipes), Ogg codecs use the\
    \ Ogg Bitstream Format to provide\n   framing/sync, sync recapture after error,\
    \ landmarks during seeking,\n   and enough information to properly separate data\
    \ back into packets at\n   the original packet boundaries without relying on decoding\
    \ to find\n   packet boundaries.  The application/ogg MIME type refers to this\
    \ kind\n   of bitstreams, when no further knowledge of the bitstream content\n\
    \   exists.\n   The bitstream format in itself is documented in [1].\n"
- title: 2. Registration Information
  contents:
  - "2. Registration Information\n   To: ietf-types@iana.org\n   Subject: Registration\
    \ of MIME media type application/ogg\n   MIME media type name: application\n \
    \  MIME subtype name: ogg\n   Required parameters: none\n   Optional parameters:\
    \ none\n   Encoding Considerations:\n   The Ogg bitstream format is binary data,\
    \ and must be encoded for\n   non-binary transport; the Base64 encoding is suitable\
    \ for Email.\n   Binary encoding could also be used.\n   Security Considerations:\n\
    \   As the Ogg bitstream file is a container format and only a carrier of\n  \
    \ content (such as Vorbis audio) with a very rigid definition (see\n   [1]), this\
    \ format in itself is not more vulnerable than any other\n   content framing mechanism.\
    \  The main security consideration for the\n   receiving application is to ensure\
    \ that manipulated packages can not\n   cause buffer overflows and the like. \
    \ It is possible to encapsulate\n   even executable content in the bitstream,\
    \ so for such uses additional\n   security considerations must be taken.\n   Ogg\
    \ bitstream files are not signed or encrypted using any applicable\n   encryption\
    \ schemes.  External security mechanisms must be added if\n   content confidentiality\
    \ and authenticity is to be achieved.\n   Interoperability considerations:\n \
    \  The Ogg bitstream format has proved to be widely implementable across\n   different\
    \ computing platforms.  A broadly portable reference\n   implementation is available\
    \ under a BSD license.\n   The Ogg bitstream format is not patented and can be\
    \ implemented by\n   third parties without patent considerations.\n   Published\
    \ specification:\n   See [1].\n   Applications which use this media type:\n  \
    \ Any application that implements the specification will be able to\n   encode\
    \ or decode Ogg bitstream files.  Specifically, the format is\n   supposed to\
    \ be used by subcodecs that implement, for example, Vorbis\n   audio.\n   Additional\
    \ information:\n   Magic number(s):\n   In Ogg bitstream files, the first four\
    \ bytes are 0x4f 0x67 0x67 0x53\n   corresponding to the string \"OggS\".\n  \
    \ File extension: .ogg\n   Macintosh File Type Code(s): OggS\n   Object Identifier(s)\
    \ or OID(s): none\n   Person & email address to contact for further information:\n\
    \   Questions about this proposal should be directed to Linus Walleij\n   <triad@df.lth.se>.\
    \  Technical questions about the Ogg bitstream\n   standard may be asked on the\
    \ mailing lists for the developer\n   community.  <http://www.xiph.org/archives/>\n\
    \   Intended usage: COMMON\n   Author/Change controller:\n   This document was\
    \ written by Linus Walleij <triad@df.lth.se>.\n   Changes to this document will\
    \ either be handled by him, a\n   representative of the Xiph.org, or the associated\
    \ development\n   communities.\n   The Ogg bitstream format is controlled by the\
    \ Xiph.org and the\n   respective development communities.\n"
