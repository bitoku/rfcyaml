Abstract The registration policy for the "Network Configuration Protocol (NETCONF) Capability URNs" registry, set up by RFC 6241, has turned out to be unnecessarily strict.
This document changes that registration policy to "IETF Review", allowing registrations from certain well reviewed Experimental RFCs, in addition to Standards Track RFCs.
The "Network Configuration Protocol (NETCONF) Capability URNs" registry [RFC6241] was set up with a registration policy of "Standards Action" [RFC5226], allowing registrations only from Standards Track RFCs.
This provided thorough review of the specifications that are requesting NETCONF Capability URNs.
It has turned out to be desirable to allocate capability URNs for certain Experimental RFCs also, provided those specifications are also carefully reviewed.
The existing registration policy is, therefore, unnecessarily strict, requiring exception handling by the IESG.
This document changes that registration policy to "IETF Review", which also allows registrations from certain well reviewed Experimental RFCs, or, for example, corrections to registry errors from Informational RFCs, with IETF review and consensus.
IANA Considerations IANA has changed the registration policy for the "Network Configuration Protocol (NETCONF) Capability URNs" registry to "IETF Review" and has added this document to the registry's reference field.
Registrations made from RFCs that are not on the Standards Track need to be carefully reviewed through IETF Last Call and in consultation with relevant working groups, such as NETCONF.
The Operations and Management Area Directors should confirm that the document has received the appropriate level of review during IESG Evaluation.
Security Considerations This document is purely procedural, and there are no related security considerations.
