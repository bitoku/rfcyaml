  - "                  SMFS Login and Logout\n        Two new commands have been added\
    \ to UCSB's Simple Minded\nFile System (SMFS).  They are described below.\n  \
    \      Login (LGI)\n        The login command is the means whereby the user\n\
    identifies himself and specifies the account number to which his\nuse of SMFS\
    \ is to be billed.  The user should issue a LGI command\ndirectly after completing\
    \ the ICP and before any command\nreferencing a file.  The user name and account\
    \ number specified\nremain in effect until another LGI command is issued, a LGO\n\
    command is issued, or the connection is closed.\n        At present, the use of\
    \ SMFS is not billed, and therefore\nuse of the accounting commands is optional.\
    \  It is requested,\nhowever, that users and user processes begin to use this\
    \ command\nas soon as possible, since we would like to collect statistics on\n\
    SMFS utilization before implementing billing.  Therefore, at\npresent the user\
    \ name can be any name that identfies the user,\nand the account number is completely\
    \ arbitrary.\n        The format of the LGI command is given below.  Note that\n\
    the lengths of the fixed-length fields are given in bits.  The op\ncode for LGI\
    \ is decimal 13.\n            8\n        <op code><user name><account number>\n\
    The <user name> and <account number> fields are further divided\nas follows:\n\
    \            8     8*length\n        <length><user name>\nwhere <length> gives\
    \ the length in 8-bit characters of the <user\nname> or <account number> subfield.\
    \  The maximum length of <user\nname> is eight characters and of <account number>\
    \ is four\ncharacters.  The <user name> and <account number> fields must\nconsist\
    \ of characters chosen from the same character set as\nfilenames.\n        Logout\
    \ (LGO)\n        The logout command terminates the association between the\nuser\
    \ and the accounting information specified in the last LGI\ncommand issued, if\
    \ any; it does not cause SMFS to close the\nconnection.  The user should then\
    \ issue another LGI command\nbefore attempting any operation referencing a file.\
    \  It is not\nnecessary to issue a LGO command before issuing another LGI\ncommand,\
    \ or before closing the connection.\n        Again, at the present time the LGO\
    \ command is optional,\nand does not affect the user's ability to reference files.\n\
    \        The format of the LGO command is as follows:\n            8\n       \
    \ <op code>\nThe op code for LGO is decimal 14.\n    [ This RFC was put into machine\
    \ readable form for entry ]\n    [ into the online RFC archives by BBN Corp. under\
