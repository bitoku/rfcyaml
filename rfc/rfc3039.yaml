- title: 1  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1  Introduction\n   This specification is one part of a family of standards for\
    \ the X.509\n   Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) for the Internet.  It is based\
    \ on RFC\n   2459, which defines underlying certificate formats and semantics\n\
    \   needed for a full implementation of this standard.\n   The standard profiles\
    \ the format for a specific type of certificates\n   named Qualified Certificates.\
    \  The term Qualified Certificates and\n   the assumptions that affects the scope\
    \ of this document are discussed\n   in Section 2.\n   Section 3 defines requirements\
    \ on information content in Qualified\n   Certificates.  This profile addresses\
    \ two fields in the basic\n   certificate as well as five certificate extensions.\
    \  The certificate\n   fields are the subject and issuer fields.  The certificate\
    \ extensions\n   are subject directory attributes, certificate policies, key usage,\
    \ a\n   private extension for storage of biometric data and a private\n   extension\
    \ for storage of statements related to Qualified\n   Certificates.  The private\
    \ extensions are presented in the 1993\n   Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1),\
    \ but in conformance with RFC\n   2459 the 1988 ASN.1 module in Appendix A contains\
    \ all normative\n   definitions (the 1993 module in Appendix A is informative).\n\
    \   In Section 4, some security considerations are discussed in order to\n   clarify\
    \ the security context in which Qualified Certificates are\n   assumed to be utilized.\
    \  Section 5 contains the references.\n   Appendix A contains all relevant ASN.1\
    \ [X.680] structures that are\n   not already defined in RFC 2459.  Appendix B\
    \ contains a note on\n   attributes.  Appendix C contains an example certificate.\
    \  Appendix D\n   contains authors' addresses and Appendix E contains the IETF\n\
    \   Copyright Statement.\n   It should be noted that this specification does not\
    \ define the\n   specific semantics of Qualified Certificates, and does not define\
    \ the\n   policies that should be used with them.  That is, this document\n  \
    \ defines what information should go into Qualified Certificates, but\n   not\
    \ what that information means.  A system that uses Qualified\n   Certificates\
    \ must define its own semantics for the information in\n   Qualified Certificates.\
    \  It is expected that laws and corporate\n   policies will make these definitions.\n"
- title: 2  Requirements and Assumptions
  contents:
  - "2  Requirements and Assumptions\n   The term \"Qualified Certificate\" has been\
    \ used by the European\n   Commission to describe a certain type of certificates\
    \ with specific\n   relevance for European legislation.  This specification is\
    \ intended\n   to support this class of certificates, but its scope is not limited\n\
    \   to this application.\n   Within this standard the term \"Qualified Certificate\"\
    \ is used more\n   generally, describing the format for a certificate whose primary\n\
    \   purpose is identifying a person with high level of assurance in\n   public\
    \ non-repudiation services.  The actual mechanisms that will\n   decide whether\
    \ a certificate should or should not be considered to be\n   a \"Qualified Certificate\"\
    \ in regard to any legislation are outside\n   the scope of this standard.\n \
    \  Harmonization in the field of Qualified Certificates is essential\n   within\
    \ several aspects that fall outside the scope of RFC 2459.  The\n   most important\
    \ aspects that affect the scope of this specification\n   are:\n   -  Definition\
    \ of names and identity information in order to identify\n      the associated\
    \ subject in a uniform way.\n   -  Definition of information which identifies\
    \ the CA and the\n      jurisdiction under which the CA operates when issuing\
    \ a particular\n      certificate.\n   -  Definition of key usage extension usage\
    \ for Qualified\n      Certificates.\n   -  Definition of information structure\
    \ for storage of biometric\n      information.\n   -  Definition of a standardized\
    \ way to store predefined statements\n      with relevance for Qualified Certificates.\n\
    \   -  Requirements for critical extensions.\n"
- title: 2.1  Properties
  contents:
  - "2.1  Properties\n   A Qualified Certificate as defined in this standard is assumed\
    \ to\n   have the following properties:\n   -  The certificate is issued by a\
    \ CA that makes a public statement\n      that the certificate serves the purpose\
    \ of a Qualified\n      Certificate, as discussed in Section 2.2\n   -  The certificate\
    \ indicates a certificate policy consistent with\n      liabilities, practices\
    \ and procedures undertaken by the CA, as\n      discussed in 2.3\n   -  The certificate\
    \ is issued to a natural person (living human\n      being).\n   -  The certificate\
    \ contains an identity based on a pseudonym or a\n      real name of the subject.\n"
- title: 2.2  Statement of Purpose
  contents:
  - "2.2  Statement of Purpose\n   For a certificate to serve the purpose of being\
    \ a Qualified\n   Certificate, this profile assumes that the CA will have to include\
    \ in\n   the certificate information that explicitly defines this intent.\n  \
    \ The function of this information is thus to assist any concerned\n   entity\
    \ in evaluating the risk associated with creating or accepting\n   signatures\
    \ that are based on a Qualified Certificate.\n   This profile defines two complementary\
    \ ways to include this\n   information:\n   -  As information defined by a certificate\
    \ policy included in the\n      certificate policies extension, and\n   -  As\
    \ a statement included in the Qualified Certificates Statements\n      extension.\n"
- title: 2.3  Policy Issues
  contents:
  - "2.3  Policy Issues\n   Certain policy aspects define the context in which this\
    \ profile is to\n   be understood and used.  It is however outside the scope of\
    \ this\n   profile to specify any policies or legal aspects that will govern\n\
    \   services that issue or utilize certificates according to this\n   profile.\n\
    \   It is however assumed that the issuing CA will undertake to follow a\n   publicly\
    \ available certificate policy that is consistent with its\n   liabilities, practices\
    \ and procedures.\n"
- title: 2.4  Uniqueness of names
  contents:
  - "2.4  Uniqueness of names\n   Distinguished name is originally defined in X.501\
    \ [X.501] as a\n   representation of a directory name, defined as a construct\
    \ that\n   identifies a particular object from among the set of all objects. \
    \ An\n   object can be assigned a distinguished name without being represented\n\
    \   by an entry in the Directory, but this name is then the name its\n   object\
    \ entry could have had if it were represented in the Directory.\n   In the context\
    \ of qualified certificates, a distinguished name\n   denotes a set of attribute\
    \ values [X.501] which forms a name that is\n   unambiguous within a certain domain\
    \ that forms either a real or a\n   virtual DIT (Directory Information Tree)[X.501].\
    \  In the case of\n   subject names the domain is assumed to be at least the issuing\
    \ domain\n   of the CA.  The distinguished name MUST be unique for each subject\n\
    \   entity certified by the one CA as defined by the issuer name field,\n   during\
    \ the whole life time of the CA.\n"
- title: 3  Certificate and Certificate Extensions Profile
  contents:
  - "3  Certificate and Certificate Extensions Profile\n   This section defines a\
    \ profile for Qualified Certificates.  The\n   profile is based on the Internet\
    \ certificate profile RFC 2459 which\n   in turn is based on the X.509 version\
    \ 3 format.  For full\n   implementation of this section implementers are REQUIRED\
    \ to consult\n   the underlying formats and semantics defined in RFC 2459.\n \
    \  ASN.1 definitions relevant for this section that are not supplied by\n   RFC\
    \ 2459 are supplied in Appendix A.\n"
- title: 3.1  Basic Certificate Fields
  contents:
  - "3.1  Basic Certificate Fields\n   This specification provides additional details\
    \ regarding the contents\n   of two fields in the basic certificate.  These fields\
    \ are the issuer\n   and subject fields.\n"
- title: 3.1.1  Issuer
  contents:
  - "3.1.1  Issuer\n   The issuer field SHALL identify the organization responsible\
    \ for\n   issuing the certificate.  The name SHOULD be an officially registered\n\
    \   name of the organization.\n   The identity of the issuer SHALL be specified\
    \ using an appropriate\n   subset of the following attributes:\n         domainComponent;\n\
    \         countryName;\n         stateOrProvinceName;\n         organizationName;\n\
    \         localityName; and\n         serialNumber.\n   Additional attributes\
    \ MAY be present but they SHOULD NOT be necessary\n   to identify the issuing\
    \ organization.\n   Attributes present in the issuer field SHOULD be consistent\
    \ with the\n   laws under which the issuer operates.\n   A relying party MAY have\
    \ to consult associated certificate policies\n   and/or the issuer's CPS, in order\
    \ to determine the semantics of name\n   fields and the laws under which the issuer\
    \ operates.\n"
- title: 3.1.2  Subject
  contents:
  - "3.1.2  Subject\n   The subject field of a certificate compliant with this profile\
    \ SHALL\n   contain a distinguished name of the subject (see 2.4 for definition\n\
    \   of distinguished name).\n   The subject field SHALL contain an appropriate\
    \ subset of the\n   following attributes:\n      countryName;\n      commonName;\n\
    \      surname;\n      givenName;\n      pseudonym;\n      serialNumber;\n   \
    \   organizationName;\n      organizationalUnitName;\n      stateOrProvinceName\n\
    \      localityName and\n      postalAddress.\n   Other attributes may be present\
    \ but MUST NOT be necessary to\n   distinguish the subject name from other subject\
    \ names within the\n   issuer domain.\n   Of these attributes, the subject field\
    \ SHALL include at least one of\n   the following:\n      Choice   I:  commonName\n\
    \      Choice  II:  givenName\n      Choice III:  pseudonym\n   The countryName\
    \ attribute value specifies a general context in which\n   other attributes are\
    \ to be understood.  The country attribute does\n   not necessarily indicate the\
    \ subject's country of citizenship or\n   country of residence, nor does it have\
    \ to indicate the country of\n   issuance.\n   Note: Many X.500 implementations\
    \ require the presence of countryName\n   in the DIT.  In cases where the subject\
    \ name, as specified in the\n   subject field, specifies a public X.500 directory\
    \ entry, the\n   countryName attribute SHOULD always be present.\n   The commonName\
    \ attribute value SHALL, when present, contain a name of\n   the subject.  This\
    \ MAY be in the subject's preferred presentation\n   format, or a format preferred\
    \ by the CA, or some other format.\n   Pseudonyms, nicknames and names with spelling\
    \ other than defined by\n   the registered name MAY be used.  To understand the\
    \ nature of the\n   name presented in commonName, complying applications MAY have\
    \ to\n   examine present values of the givenName and surname attributes, or\n\
    \   the pseudonym attribute.\n   Note: Many client implementations presuppose\
    \ the presence of the\n   commonName attribute value in the subject field and\
    \ use this value to\n   display the subject's name regardless of present givenName,\
    \ surname\n   or pseudonym attribute values.\n   The surname and givenName attribute\
    \ types SHALL, if present, contain\n   the registered name of the subject, in\
    \ accordance with the laws under\n   which the CA prepares the certificate.  These\
    \ attributes SHALL be\n   used in the subject field if the commonName attribute\
    \ is not present.\n   In cases where the subject only has a single name registered,\
    \ the\n   givenName attribute SHALL be used and the surname attribute SHALL be\n\
    \   omitted.\n   The pseudonym attribute type SHALL, if present, contain a pseudonym\n\
    \   of the subject.  Use of the pseudonym attribute MUST NOT be combined\n   with\
    \ use of any of the attributes surname and/or givenName.\n   The serialNumber\
    \ attribute type SHALL, when present, be used to\n   differentiate between names\
    \ where the subject field would otherwise\n   be identical.  This attribute has\
    \ no defined semantics beyond\n   ensuring uniqueness of subject names.  It MAY\
    \ contain a number or\n   code assigned by the CA or an identifier assigned by\
    \ a government or\n   civil authority.  It is the CA's responsibility to ensure\
    \ that the\n   serialNumber is sufficient to resolve any subject name collisions.\n\
    \   The organizationName and the organizationalUnitName attribute types\n   SHALL,\
    \ when present, be used to store the name and relevant\n   information of an organization\
    \ with which the subject is associated.\n   The type of association between the\
    \ organization and the subject is\n   beyond the scope of this document.\n   The\
    \ postalAddress, the stateOrProvinceName and the localityName\n   attribute types\
    \ SHALL, when present, be used to store address and\n   geographical information\
    \ with which the subject is associated.  If an\n   organizationName value also\
    \ is present then the postalAddress,\n   stateOrProvinceName and localityName\
    \ attribute values SHALL be\n   associated with the specified organization.  The\
    \ type of association\n   between the postalAddress, stateOrProvinceName and the\
    \ localityName\n   and either the subject or the organizationName is beyond the\

    \   Other statements suitable for inclusion in this extension MAY be\n   statements\

- title: 4  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "4  Security Considerations\n   The legal value of a digital signature that is\
    \ validated with a\n   Qualified Certificate will be highly dependent upon the\
    \ policy\n   governing the use of the associated private key.  Both the private\n\
    \   key holder as well as the relying party should make sure that the\n   private\
    \ key is used only with the consent of the legitimate key\n   holder.\n   Since\
    \ the public keys are for public use with legal implications for\n   involved\
    \ parties, certain conditions should exist before CAs issue\n   certificates as\
    \ Qualified Certificates.  The associated private keys\n   must be unique for\
    \ the subject, and must be maintained under the\n   subject's sole control.  That\
    \ is, a CA should not issue a qualified\n   certificate if the means to use the\
    \ private key is not protected\n   against unintended usage.  This implies that\
    \ the CA have some\n   knowledge about the subject's cryptographic module.\n \
    \  The CA must further verify that the public key contained in the\n   certificate\
    \ is legitimately representing the subject.\n   CAs should not issue CA certificates\
    \ with policy mapping extensions\n   indicating acceptance of another CA's policy\
    \ unless these conditions\n   are met.\n   Combining the nonRepudiation bit in\
    \ the keyUsage certificate\n   extension with other keyUsage bits may have security\
    \ implications and\n   this specification therefore recommends against such practices.\n\
    \   The ability to compare two qualified certificates to determine if\n   they\
    \ represent the same physical entity is dependent on the semantics\n   of the\
    \ subjects' names.  The semantics of a particular attribute may\n   be different\
    \ for different issuers.  Comparing names without\n   knowledge of the semantics\
    \ of names in these particular certificates\n   may provide misleading results.\n\
    \   This specification is a profile of RFC 2459.  The security\n   considerations\
    \ section of that document applies to this specification\n   as well.\n"
