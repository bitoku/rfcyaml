    \ Status Notifications\nStatus of this Memo\n   This document specifies an Internet\
    \ standards track protocol for the\n   Internet community, and requests discussion\
    \ and suggestions for\n   improvements.  Please refer to the current edition of\
    \ the \"Internet\n   Official Protocol Standards\" (STD 1) for the standardization\
    \ state\n   and status of this protocol.  Distribution of this memo is unlimited.\n\
    1. Abstract\n   This memo defines an extension to the SMTP service, which allows\
    \ an\n   SMTP client to specify (a) that delivery status notifications (DSNs)\n\
    \   should be generated under certain conditions, (b) whether such\n   notifications\
    \ should return the contents of the message, and (c)\n   additional information,\
    \ to be returned with a DSN, that allows the\n   sender to identify both the recipient(s)\
    \ for which the DSN was\n   issued, and the transaction in which the original\
    \ message was sent.\n   Any questions, comments, and reports of defects or ambiguities\
    \ in\n   this specification may be sent to the mailing list for the NOTARY\n \
    \  working group of the IETF, using the address\n   <notifications@cs.utk.edu>.\
    \  Requests to subscribe to the mailing\n   list should be addressed to <notifications-request@cs.utk.edu>.\n\
    \   Implementors of this specification are encouraged to subscribe to the\n  \
    \ mailing list, so that they will quickly be informed of any problems\n   which\
    \ might hinder interoperability.\n   NOTE: This document is a Proposed Standard.\
    \  If and when this\n   protocol is submitted for Draft Standard status, any normative\
    \ text\n   (phrases containing SHOULD, SHOULD NOT, MUST, MUST NOT, or MAY) in\n\
    \   this document will be re-evaluated in light of implementation\n   experience,\
    \ and are thus subject to change.\n2. Introduction\n   The SMTP protocol [1] requires\
    \ that an SMTP server provide\n   notification of delivery failure, if it determines\
    \ that a message\n   cannot be delivered to one or more recipients.  Traditionally,\
    \ such\n   notification consists of an ordinary Internet mail message (format\n\
    \   defined by [2]), sent to the envelope sender address (the argument of\n  \
    \ the SMTP MAIL command), containing an explanation of the error and at\n   least\
    \ the headers of the failed message.\n   Experience with large mail distribution\
    \ lists [3] indicates that such\n   messages are often insufficient to diagnose\
    \ problems, or even to\n   determine at which host or for which recipients a problem\
    \ occurred.\n   In addition, the lack of a standardized format for delivery\n\
    \   notifications in Internet mail makes it difficult to exchange such\n   notifications\
    \ with other message handling systems.\n   Such experience has demonstrated a\
    \ need for a delivery status\n   notification service for Internet electronic\
    \ mail, which:\n(a) is reliable, in the sense that any DSN request will either\
    \ be\n    honored at the time of final delivery, or result in a response\n   \
    \ that indicates that the request cannot be honored,\n(b) when both success and\
    \ failure notifications are requested,\n    provides an unambiguous and nonconflicting\
    \ indication of whether\n    delivery of a message to a recipient succeeded or\
    \ failed,\n(c) is stable, in that a failed attempt to deliver a DSN should never\n\
    \    result in the transmission of another DSN over the network,\n(d) preserves\
    \ sufficient information to allow the sender to identify\n    both the mail transaction\
    \ and the recipient address which caused\n    the notification, even when mail\
    \ is forwarded or gatewayed to\n    foreign environments, and\n(e) interfaces\
    \ acceptably with non-SMTP and non-822-based mail\n    systems, both so that notifications\
    \ returned from foreign mail\n    systems may be useful to Internet users, and\
    \ so that the\n    notification requests from foreign environments may be honored.\n\
    \    Among the requirements implied by this goal are the ability to\n    request\
    \ non-return-of-content, and the ability to specify whether\n    positive delivery\
    \ notifications, negative delivery notifications,\n    both, or neither, should\
    \ be issued.\n   In an attempt to provide such a service, this memo uses the mechanism\n\
    \   defined in [4] to define an extension to the SMTP protocol.  Using\n   this\
    \ mechanism, an SMTP client may request that an SMTP server issue\n   or not issue\
    \ a delivery status notification (DSN) under certain\n   conditions.  The format\
    \ of a DSN is defined in [5].\n3. Framework for the Delivery Status Notification\
    \ Extension\n   The following service extension is therefore defined:\n(1) The\
    \ name of the SMTP service extension is \"Delivery Status\n    Notification\"\
    ;\n(2) the EHLO keyword value associated with this extension is \"DSN\",\n   \
    \ the meaning of which is defined in section 4 of this memo;\n(3) no parameters\
    \ are allowed with this EHLO keyword value;\n(4) two optional parameters are added\
    \ to the RCPT command, and two\n    optional parameters are added to the MAIL\
    \ command:\n    An optional parameter for the RCPT command, using the\n    esmtp-keyword\
    \ \"NOTIFY\", (to specify the conditions under which a\n    delivery status notification\
    \ should be generated), is defined in\n    section 5.1,\n    An optional parameter\
    \ for the RCPT command, using the\n    esmtp-keyword \"ORCPT\", (used to convey\
    \ the \"original\"\n    (sender-specified) recipient address), is defined in section\
    \ 5.2,\n    and\n    An optional parameter for the MAIL command, using the\n \
    \   esmtp-keyword \"RET\", (to request that DSNs containing an\n    indication\
    \ of delivery failure either return the entire contents\n    of a message or only\
    \ the message headers), is defined in section\n    5.3,\n    An optional parameter\
    \ for the MAIL command, using the\n    esmtp-keyword \"ENVID\", (used to propagate\
    \ an identifier for this\n    message transmission envelope, which is also known\
    \ to the sender\n    and will, if present, be returned in any DSNs issued for\
    \ this\n    transmission), is defined in section 5.4;\n(5) no additional SMTP\
    \ verbs are defined by this extension.\n   The remainder of this memo specifies\
    \ how support for the extension\n   effects the behavior of a message transfer\
    \ agent.\n4.  The Delivery Status Notification service extension\n   An SMTP client\
    \ wishing to request a DSN for a message may issue the\n   EHLO command to start\
    \ an SMTP session, to determine if the server\n   supports any of several service\
    \ extensions.  If the server responds\n   with code 250 to the EHLO command, and\
    \ the response includes the EHLO\n   keyword DSN, then the Delivery Status Notification\
    \ extension (as\n   described in this memo) is supported.\n   Ordinarily, when\
    \ an SMTP server returns a positive (2xx) reply code\n   in response to a RCPT\
    \ command, it agrees to accept responsibility for\n   either delivering the message\
    \ to the named recipient, or sending a\n   notification to the sender of the message\
    \ indicating that delivery\n   has failed.  However, an extended SMTP (\"ESMTP\"\
    ) server which\n   implements this service extension will accept an optional NOTIFY\n\
    \   parameter with the RCPT command. If present, the NOTIFY parameter\n   alters\
    \ the conditions for generation of delivery status notifications\n   from the\
    \ default (issue notifications only on failure) specified in\n   [1].  The ESMTP\
    \ client may also request (via the RET parameter)\n   whether the entire contents\
    \ of the original message should be\n   returned (as opposed to just the headers\
    \ of that message), along with\n   the DSN.\n   In general, an ESMTP server which\
    \ implements this service extension\n   will propagate delivery status notification\
    \ requests when relaying\n   mail to other SMTP-based MTAs which also support\
    \ this extension, and\n   make a \"best effort\" to ensure that such requests\
    \ are honored when\n   messages are passed into other environments.\n   In order\
    \ that any delivery status notifications thus generated will\n   be meaningful\
    \ to the sender, any ESMTP server which supports this\n   extension will attempt\
    \ to propagate the following information to any\n   other MTAs that are used to\
    \ relay the message, for use in generating\n   DSNs:\n(a) for each recipient,\
    \ a copy of the original recipient address, as\n    used by the sender of the\
    \ message.\n    This address need not be the same as the mailbox specified in\
    \ the\n    RCPT command.  For example, if a message was originally addressed\n\
    \    to A@B.C and later forwarded to A@D.E, after such forwarding has\n    taken\
    \ place, the RCPT command will specify a mailbox of A@D.E.\n    However, the original\
    \ recipient address remains A@B.C.\n    Also, if the message originated from an\
    \ environment which does not\n    use Internet-style user@domain addresses, and\
    \ was gatewayed into\n    SMTP, the original recipient address will preserve the\
    \ original\n    form of the recipient address.\n(b) for the entire SMTP transaction,\
    \ an envelope identification\n    string, which may be used by the sender to associate\
    \ any delivery\n    status notifications with the transaction used to send the\n\
    \    original message.\n5.  Additional parameters for RCPT and MAIL commands\n\
    \   The extended RCPT and MAIL commands are issued by a client when it\n   wishes\
    \ to request a DSN from the server, under certain conditions,\n   for a particular\
    \ recipient.  The extended RCPT and MAIL commands are\n   identical to the RCPT\
    \ and MAIL commands defined in [1], except that\n   one or more of the following\
    \ parameters appear after the sender or\n   recipient address, respectively. \
    \ The general syntax for extended\n   SMTP commands is defined in [4].\n   NOTE:\
    \ Although RFC 822 ABNF is used to describe the syntax of these\n   parameters,\
    \ they are not, in the language of that document,\n   \"structured field bodies\"\
    .  Therefore, while parentheses MAY appear\n   within an emstp-value, they are\
    \ not recognized as comment delimiters.\n   The syntax for \"esmtp-value\" in\
    \ [4] does not allow SP, \"=\", control\n   characters, or characters outside\
    \ the traditional ASCII range of 1-\n   127 decimal to be transmitted in an esmtp-value.\
    \  Because the ENVID\n   and ORCPT parameters may need to convey values outside\
    \ this range,\n   the esmtp-values for these parameters are encoded as \"xtext\"\
    .\n   \"xtext\" is formally defined as follows:\n     xtext = *( xchar / hexchar\
    \ )\n     xchar = any ASCII CHAR between \"!\" (33) and \"~\" (126) inclusive,\n\
    \          except for \"+\" and \"=\".\n; \"hexchar\"s are intended to encode\
    \ octets that cannot appear\n; as ASCII characters within an esmtp-value.\n  \
    \   hexchar = ASCII \"+\" immediately followed by two upper case\n          hexadecimal\
    \ digits\nWhen encoding an octet sequence as xtext:\n+ Any ASCII CHAR between\
    \ \"!\" and \"~\" inclusive, except for \"+\" and \"=\",\n  MAY be encoded as\
    \ itself.  (A CHAR in this range MAY instead be\n  encoded as a \"hexchar\", at\
    \ the implementor's discretion.)\n+ ASCII CHARs that fall outside the range above\
    \ must be encoded as\n  \"hexchar\".\n5.1  The NOTIFY parameter of the ESMTP RCPT\
    \ command\n   A RCPT command issued by a client may contain the optional esmtp-\n\
    \   keyword \"NOTIFY\", to specify the conditions under which the SMTP\n   server\
    \ should generate DSNs for that recipient.  If the NOTIFY\n   esmtp-keyword is\
    \ used, it MUST have an associated esmtp-value,\n   formatted according to the\
    \ following rules, using the ABNF of RFC\n   822:\n     notify-esmtp-value = \"\
    NEVER\" / 1#notify-list-element\n     notify-list-element = \"SUCCESS\" / \"FAILURE\"\
    \ / \"DELAY\"\nNotes:\na. Multiple notify-list-elements, separated by commas,\
    \ MAY appear in a\n   NOTIFY parameter; however, the NEVER keyword MUST appear\
    \ by itself.\nb. Any of the keywords NEVER, SUCCESS, FAILURE, or DELAY may be\
    \ spelled\n   in any combination of upper and lower case letters.\nThe meaning\
    \ of the NOTIFY parameter values is generally as follows:\n+ A NOTIFY parameter\
    \ value of \"NEVER\" requests that a DSN not be\n  returned to the sender under\
    \ any conditions.\n+ A NOTIFY parameter value containing the \"SUCCESS\" or \"\
    FAILURE\"\n  keywords requests that a DSN be issued on successful delivery or\n\
    \  delivery failure, respectively.\n+ A NOTIFY parameter value containing the\
    \ keyword \"DELAY\" indicates the\n  sender's willingness to receive \"delayed\"\
    \ DSNs.  Delayed DSNs may be\n  issued if delivery of a message has been delayed\
    \ for an unusual amount\n  of time (as determined by the MTA at which the message\
    \ is delayed),\n  but the final delivery status (whether successful or failure)\
    \ cannot\n  be determined.  The absence of the DELAY keyword in a NOTIFY parameter\n\
    \  requests that a \"delayed\" DSN NOT be issued under any conditions.\n   The\
    \ actual rules governing interpretation of the NOTIFY parameter are\n   given\
    \ in section 6.\n   For compatibility with SMTP clients that do not use the NOTIFY\n\
    \   facility, the absence of a NOTIFY parameter in a RCPT command may be\n   interpreted\
    \ as either NOTIFY=FAILURE or NOTIFY=FAILURE,DELAY.\n5.2 The ORCPT parameter to\
    \ the ESMTP RCPT command\n   The ORCPT esmtp-keyword of the RCPT command is used\
    \ to specify an\n   \"original\" recipient address that corresponds to the actual\
    \ recipient\n   to which the message is to be delivered.  If the ORCPT esmtp-keyword\n\
    \   is used, it MUST have an associated esmtp-value, which consists of\n   the\
    \ original recipient address, encoded according to the rules below.\n   The ABNF\
    \ for the ORCPT parameter is:\n     orcpt-parameter = \"ORCPT=\" original-recipient-address\n\
    \     original-recipient-address = addr-type \";\" xtext\n     addr-type = atom\n\
    \   The \"addr-type\" portion MUST be an IANA-registered electronic mail\n   address-type\
    \ (as defined in [5]), while the \"xtext\" portion contains\n   an encoded representation\
    \ of the original recipient address using the\n   rules in section 5 of this document.\
    \  The entire ORCPT parameter MAY\n   be up to 500 characters in length.\n   When\
    \ initially submitting a message via SMTP, if the ORCPT parameter\n   is used,\
    \ it MUST contain the same address as the RCPT TO address\n   (unlike the RCPT\
    \ TO address, the ORCPT parameter will be encoded as\n   xtext).  Likewise, when\
    \ a mailing list submits a message via SMTP to\n   be distributed to the list\
    \ subscribers, if ORCPT is used, the ORCPT\n   parameter MUST match the new RCPT\
    \ TO address of each recipient, not\n   the address specified by the original\
    \ sender of the message.)\n   The \"addr-type\" portion of the original-recipient-address\
    \ is used to\n   indicate the \"type\" of the address which appears in the ORCPT\n\
    \   parameter value.  However, the address associated with the ORCPT\n   keyword\
    \ is NOT constrained to conform to the syntax rules for that\n   \"addr-type\"\
    .\n   Ideally, the \"xtext\" portion of the original-recipient-address should\n\
    \   contain, in encoded form, the same sequence of characters that the\n   sender\
    \ used to specify the recipient.  However, for a message\n   gatewayed from an\
    \ environment (such as X.400) in which a recipient\n   address is not a simple\
    \ string of printable characters, the\n   representation of recipient address\
    \ must be defined by a\n   specification for gatewaying between DSNs and that\
    \ environment.\n5.3 The RET parameter of the ESMTP MAIL command\n   The RET esmtp-keyword\
    \ on the extended MAIL command specifies whether\n   or not the message should\
    \ be included in any failed DSN issued for\n   this message transmission.  If\
    \ the RET esmtp-keyword is used, it MUST\n   have an associated esmtp-value, which\
    \ is one of the following\n   keywords:\n   FULL  requests that the entire message\
    \ be returned in any \"failed\"\n         delivery status notification issued\
    \ for this recipient.\n   HDRS  requests that only the headers of the message\
    \ be returned.\n   The FULL and HDRS keywords may be spelled in any combination\
    \ of upper\n   and lower case letters.\n   If no RET parameter is supplied, the\
    \ MTA MAY return either the\n   headers of the message or the entire message for\
    \ any DSN containing\n   indication of failed deliveries.\n   Note that the RET\
    \ parameter only applies to DSNs that indicate\n   delivery failure for at least\
    \ one recipient.  If a DSN contains no\n   indications of delivery failure, only\
    \ the headers of the message\n   should be returned.\n5.4  The ENVID parameter\
    \ to the ESMTP MAIL command\n   The ENVID esmtp-keyword of the SMTP MAIL command\
    \ is used to specify\n   an \"envelope identifier\" to be transmitted along with\
    \ the message and\n   included in any DSNs issued for any of the recipients named\
    \ in this\n   SMTP transaction.  The purpose of the envelope identifier is to\
    \ allow\n   the sender of a message to identify the transaction for which the\
    \ DSN\n   was issued.\n   The ABNF for the ENVID parameter is:\n     envid-parameter\
    \ = \"ENVID=\" xtext\n   The ENVID esmtp-keyword MUST have an associated esmtp-value.\
    \  No\n   meaning is assigned by the mail system to the presence or absence of\n\
    \   this parameter or to any esmtp-value associated with this parameter;\n   the\
    \ information is used only by the sender or his user agent.  The\n   ENVID parameter\
    \ MAY be up to 100 characters in length.\n5.5 Restrictions on the use of Delivery\
    \ Status Notification parameters\n   The RET and ENVID parameters MUST NOT appear\
    \ more than once each in\n   any single MAIL command.  If more than one of either\
    \ of these\n   parameters appears in a MAIL command, the ESMTP server SHOULD respond\n\
    \   with \"501 syntax error in parameters or arguments\".\n   The NOTIFY and ORCPT\
    \ parameters MUST NOT appear more than once in any\n   RCPT command.  If more\
    \ than one of either of these parameters appears\n   in a RCPT command, the ESMTP\
    \ server SHOULD respond with \"501 syntax\n   error in parameters or arguments\"\
    .\n6. Conformance requirements\n   The Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) is\
    \ used by Message Transfer\n   Agents (MTAs) when accepting, relaying, or gatewaying\
    \ mail, as well\n   as User Agents (UAs) when submitting mail to the mail transport\n\
    \   system.  The DSN extension to SMTP may be used to allow UAs to convey\n  \
    \ the sender's requests as to when DSNs should be issued.  A UA which\n   claims\
    \ to conform to this specification must meet certain\n   requirements as described\
    \ below.\n   Typically, a message transfer agent (MTA) which supports SMTP will\n\
    \   assume, at different times, both the role of a SMTP client and an\n   SMTP\
    \ server, and may also provide local delivery, gatewaying to\n   foreign environments,\
    \ forwarding, and mailing list expansion.  An MTA\n   which, when acting as an\
    \ SMTP server, issues the DSN keyword in\n   response to the EHLO command, MUST\
    \ obey the rules below for a\n   \"conforming SMTP client\" when acting as a client,\
    \ and a \"conforming\n   SMTP server\" when acting as a server.  The term \"conforming\
    \ MTA\"\n   refers to an MTA which conforms to this specification, independent\
    \ of\n   its role of client or server.\n6.1 SMTP protocol interactions\n   The\
    \ following rules apply to SMTP transactions in which any of the\n   ENVID, NOTIFY,\
    \ RET, or ORCPT keywords are used:\n(a) If an SMTP client issues a MAIL command\
    \ containing a valid ENVID\n    parameter and associated esmtp-value and/or a\
    \ valid RET parameter\n    and associated esmtp-value, a conforming SMTP server\
    \ MUST return\n    the same reply-code as it would to the same MAIL command without\n\
    \    the ENVID and/or RET parameters.  A conforming SMTP server MUST\n    NOT\
    \ refuse a MAIL command based on the absence or presence of\n    valid ENVID or\
    \ RET parameters, or on their associated\n    esmtp-values.\n    However, if the\
    \ associated esmtp-value is not valid (i.e. contains\n    illegal characters),\
    \ or if there is more than one ENVID or RET\n    parameter in a particular MAIL\
    \ command, the server MUST issue the\n    reply-code 501 with an appropriate message\
    \ (e.g.  \"syntax error in\n    parameter\").\n(b) If an SMTP client issues a\
    \ RCPT command containing any valid\n    NOTIFY and/or ORCPT parameters, a conforming\
    \ SMTP server MUST\n    return the same response as it would to the same RCPT\
    \ command\n    without those NOTIFY and/or ORCPT parameters.  A conforming SMTP\n\
    \    server MUST NOT refuse a RCPT command based on the presence or\n    absence\
    \ of any of these parameters.\n    However, if any of the associated esmtp-values\
    \ are not valid, or\n    if there is more than one of any of these parameters\
    \ in a\n    particular RCPT command, the server SHOULD issue the response \"501\n\
    \    syntax error in parameter\".\n6.2 Handling of messages received via SMTP\n\
    \   This section describes how a conforming MTA should handle any\n   messages\
    \ received via SMTP.\n   NOTE: A DSN MUST NOT be returned to the sender for any\
    \ message for\n   which the return address from the SMTP MAIL command was NULL\
    \ (\"<>\"),\n   even if the sender's address is available from other sources (e.g.\n\
    \   the message header).  However, the MTA which would otherwise issue a\n   DSN\
    \ SHOULD inform the local postmaster of delivery failures through\n   some appropriate\
    \ mechanism that will not itself result in the\n   generation of DSNs.\n   DISCUSSION:\
    \ RFC 1123, section 2.3.3 requires error notifications to\n   be sent with a NULL\
    \ return address (\"reverse-path\").  This creates an\n   interesting situation\
    \ when a message arrives with one or more\n   nonfunctional recipient addresses\
    \ in addition to a nonfunctional\n   return address.  When delivery to one of\
    \ the recipient addresses\n   fails, the MTA will attempt to send a nondelivery\
    \ notification to the\n   return address, setting the return address on the notification\
    \ to\n   NULL.  When the delivery of this notification fails, the MTA\n   attempting\
    \ delivery of that notification sees a NULL return address.\n   If that MTA were\
    \ not to inform anyone of the situation, the original\n   message would be silently\
    \ lost.  Furthermore, a nonfunctional return\n   address is often indicative of\
    \ a configuration problem in the\n   sender's MTA.  Reporting the condition to\
    \ the local postmaster may\n   help to speed correction of such errors.\n6.2.1\
    \ Relay of messages to other conforming SMTP servers\n   The following rules govern\
    \ the behavior of a conforming MTA, when\n   relaying a message which was received\
    \ via the SMTP protocol, to an\n   SMTP server that supports the Delivery Status\
    \ Notification service\n   extension:\n(a) Any ENVID parameter included in the\
    \ MAIL command when a message was\n    received, MUST also appear on the MAIL\
    \ command with which the\n    message is relayed, with the same associated esmtp-value.\
    \  If no\n    ENVID parameter was included in the MAIL command when the message\n\
    \    was received, the ENVID parameter MUST NOT be supplied when the\n    message\
    \ is relayed.\n(b) Any RET parameter included in the MAIL command when a message\
    \ was\n    received, MUST also appear on the MAIL command with which the\n   \
    \ message is relayed, with the same associated esmtp-value.  If no RET\n    parameter\
    \ was included in the MAIL command when the message was\n    received, the RET\
    \ parameter MUST NOT supplied when the message is\n    relayed.\n(c) If the NOTIFY\
    \ parameter was supplied for a recipient when the\n    message was received, the\
    \ RCPT command issued when the message is\n    relayed MUST also contain the NOTIFY\
    \ parameter along with its\n    associated esmtp-value.  If the NOTIFY parameter\
    \ was not supplied\n    for a recipient when the message was received, the NOTIFY\
    \ parameter\n    MUST NOT be supplied for that recipient when the message is relayed.\n\
    (d) If any ORCPT parameter was present in the RCPT command for a\n    recipient\
    \ when the message was received, an ORCPT parameter with the\n    identical original-recipient-address\
    \ MUST appear in the RCPT command\n    issued for that recipient when relaying\
    \ the message.  (For example,\n    the MTA therefore MUST NOT change the case\
    \ of any alphabetic\n    characters in an ORCPT parameter.)\n    If no ORCPT parameter\
    \ was present in the RCPT command when the\n    message was received, an ORCPT\
    \ parameter MAY be added to the RCPT\n    command when the message is relayed.\
    \  If an ORCPT parameter is added\n    by the relaying MTA, it MUST contain the\
    \ recipient address from the\n    RCPT command used when the message was received\
    \ by that MTA.\n6.2.2  Relay of messages to non-conforming SMTP servers\n   The\
    \ following rules govern the behavior of a conforming MTA (in the\n   role of\
    \ client), when relaying a message which was received via the\n   SMTP protocol,\
    \ to an SMTP server that does not support the Delivery\n   Status Notification\
    \ service extension:\n(a) ENVID, NOTIFY, RET, or ORCPT parameters MUST NOT be\
    \ issued when\n    relaying the message.\n(b) If the NOTIFY parameter was supplied\
    \ for a recipient, with an esmtp-\n    value containing the keyword SUCCESS, and\
    \ the SMTP server returns a\n    success (2xx) reply-code in response to the RCPT\
    \ command, the client\n    MUST issue a \"relayed\" DSN for that recipient.\n\
    (c) If the NOTIFY parameter was supplied for a recipient with an esmtp-\n    value\
    \ containing the keyword FAILURE, and the SMTP server returns a\n    permanent\
    \ failure (5xx) reply-code in response to the RCPT command,\n    the client MUST\
    \ issue a \"failed\" DSN for that recipient.\n(d) If the NOTIFY parameter was\
    \ supplied for a recipient with an esmtp-\n    value of NEVER, the client MUST\
    \ NOT issue a DSN for that recipient,\n    regardless of the reply-code returned\
    \ by the SMTP server.  However,\n    if the server returned a failure (5xx) reply-code,\
    \ the client MAY\n    inform the local postmaster of the delivery failure via\
    \ an\n    appropriate mechanism that will not itself result in the generation\n\
    \    of DSNs.\n    When attempting to relay a message to an SMTP server that does\
    \ not\n    support this extension, and if NOTIFY=NEVER was specified for some\n\
    \    recipients of that message, a conforming SMTP client MAY relay the\n    message\
    \ for those recipients in a separate SMTP transaction, using\n    an empty reverse-path\
    \ in the MAIL command.  This will prevent DSNs\n    from being issued for those\
    \ recipients by MTAs that conform to [1].\n(e) If a NOTIFY parameter was not supplied\
    \ for a recipient, and the SMTP\n    server returns a success (2xx) reply-code\
    \ in response to a RCPT\n    command, the client MUST NOT issue any DSN for that\
    \ recipient.\n(f) If a NOTIFY parameter was not supplied for a recipient, and\
    \ the SMTP\n    server returns a permanent failure (5xx) reply-code in response\
    \ to a\n    RCPT command, the client MUST issue a \"failed\" DSN for that\n  \
    \  recipient.\n6.2.3  Local delivery of messages\n   The following rules govern\
    \ the behavior of a conforming MTA upon\n   successful delivery of a message that\
    \ was received via the SMTP\n   protocol, to a local recipient's mailbox:\n  \
    \ \"Delivery\" means that the message has been placed in the recipient's\n   mailbox.\
    \  For messages which are transmitted to a mailbox for later\n   retrieval via\
    \ IMAP [6], POP [7] or a similar message access protocol,\n   \"delivery\" occurs\
    \ when the message is made available to the IMAP\n   (POP, etc.) service, rather\
    \ than when the message is retrieved by the\n   recipient's user agent.\n   Similarly,\
    \ for a recipient address which corresponds to a mailing\n   list exploder, \"\
    delivery\" occurs when the message is made available\n   to that list exploder,\
    \ even though the list exploder might refuse to\n   deliver that message to the\
    \ list recipients.\n(a) If the NOTIFY parameter was supplied for that recipient,\
    \ with an\n    esmtp-value containing the SUCCESS keyword, the MTA MUST issue\
    \ a\n    \"delivered\" DSN for that recipient.\n(b) If the NOTIFY parameter was\
    \ supplied for that recipient which did\n    not contain the SUCCESS keyword,\
    \ the MTA MUST NOT issue a DSN for\n    that recipient.\n(c) If the NOTIFY parameter\
    \ was not supplied for that recipient, the MTA\n    MUST NOT issue a DSN.\n6.2.4\
    \  Gatewaying a message into a foreign environment\n   The following rules govern\
    \ the behavior of a conforming MTA, when\n   gatewaying a message that was received\
    \ via the SMTP protocol, into a\n   foreign (non-SMTP) environment:\n(a) If the\
    \ the foreign environment is capable of issuing appropriate\n    notifications\
    \ under the conditions requested by the NOTIFY\n    parameter, and the conforming\
    \ MTA can ensure that any notification\n    thus issued will be translated into\
    \ a DSN and delivered to the\n    original sender, then the MTA SHOULD gateway\
    \ the message into the\n    foreign environment, requesting notification under\
    \ the desired\n    conditions, without itself issuing a DSN.\n(b) If a NOTIFY\
    \ parameter was supplied with the SUCCESS keyword, but the\n    destination environment\
    \ cannot return an appropriate notification on\n    successful delivery, the MTA\
    \ SHOULD issue a \"relayed\" DSN for that\n    recipient.\n(c) If a NOTIFY parameter\
    \ was supplied with an esmtp-keyword of NEVER, a\n    DSN MUST NOT be issued.\
    \  If possible, the MTA SHOULD direct the\n    destination environment to not\
    \ issue delivery notifications for that\n    recipient.\n(d) If the NOTIFY parameter\
    \ was not supplied for a particular recipient,\n    a DSN SHOULD NOT be issued\
    \ by the gateway. The gateway SHOULD\n    attempt to ensure that appropriate notification\
    \ will be provided by\n    the foreign mail environment if eventual delivery failure\
    \ occurs,\n    and that no notification will be issued on successful delivery.\n\
    (e) When gatewaying a message into a foreign environment, the return-of-\n   \
    \ content conditions specified by any RET parameter are nonbinding;\n    however,\
    \ the MTA SHOULD attempt to honor the request using whatever\n    mechanisms exist\
    \ in the foreign environment.\n6.2.5  Delays in delivery\n   If a conforming MTA\
    \ receives a message via the SMTP protocol, and is\n   unable to deliver or relay\
    \ the message to one or more recipients for\n   an extended length of time (to\
    \ be determined by the MTA), it MAY\n   issue a \"delayed\" DSN for those recipients,\
    \ subject to the following\n   conditions:\n(a) If the NOTIFY parameter was supplied\
    \ for a recipient and its value\n    included the DELAY keyword, a \"delayed\"\
    \ DSN MAY be issued.\n(b) If the NOTIFY parameter was not supplied for a recipient,\
    \ a\n    \"delayed\" DSN MAY be issued.\n(c) If the NOTIFY parameter was supplied\
    \ which did not contain the DELAY\n    keyword, a \"delayed\" DSN MUST NOT be\
    \ issued.\n   NOTE: Although delay notifications are common in present-day\n \
    \  electronic mail, a conforming MTA is never required to issue\n   \"delayed\"\
    \ DSNs.  The DELAY keyword of the NOTIFY parameter is\n   provided to allow the\
    \ SMTP client to specifically request (by\n   omitting the DELAY parameter) that\
    \ \"delayed\" DSNs NOT be issued.\n6.2.6  Failure of a conforming MTA to deliver\
    \ a message\n   The following rules govern the behavior of a conforming MTA which\n\
    \   received a message via the SMTP protocol, and is unable to deliver a\n   message\
    \ to a recipient specified in the SMTP transaction:\n(a) If a NOTIFY parameter\
    \ was supplied for the recipient with an esmtp-\n    keyword containing the value\
    \ FAILURE, a \"failed\" DSN MUST be issued\n    by the MTA.\n(b) If a NOTIFY parameter\
    \ was supplied for the recipient which did not\n    contain the value FAILURE,\
    \ a DSN MUST NOT be issued for that\n    recipient.  However, the MTA MAY inform\
    \ the local postmaster of the\n    delivery failure via some appropriate mechanism\
    \ which does not\n    itself result in the generation of DSNs.\n(c) If no NOTIFY\
    \ parameter was supplied for the recipient, a \"failed\"\n    DSN MUST be issued.\n\
    \   NOTE: Some MTAs are known to forward undeliverable messages to the\n   local\
    \ postmaster or \"dead letter\" mailbox.  This is still considered\n   delivery\
    \ failure, and does not diminish the requirement to issue a\n   \"failed\" DSN\
    \ under the conditions defined elsewhere in this memo.  If\n   a DSN is issued\
    \ for such a recipient, the Action value MUST be\n   \"failed\".\n6.2.7 Forwarding,\
    \ aliases, and mailing lists\n   Delivery of a message to a local email address\
    \ usually causes the\n   message to be stored in the recipient's mailbox.  However,\
    \ MTAs\n   commonly provide a facility where a local email address can be\n  \
    \ designated as an \"alias\" or \"mailing list\"; delivery to that address\n \
    \  then causes the message to be forwarded to each of the (local or\n   remote)\
    \ recipient addresses associated with the alias or list.  It is\n   also common\
    \ to allow a user to optionally \"forward\" her mail to one\n   or more alternate\
    \ addresses.  If this feature is enabled, her mail is\n   redistributed to those\
    \ addresses instead of being deposited in her\n   mailbox.\n   Following the example\
    \ of [9] (section 5.3.6), this document defines\n   the difference between an\
    \ \"alias\" and \"mailing list\" as follows: When\n   forwarding a message to\
    \ the addresses associated with an \"alias\", the\n   envelope return address\
    \ (e.g. SMTP MAIL FROM) remains intact.\n   However, when forwarding a message\
    \ to the addresses associated with a\n   \"mailing list\", the envelope return\
    \ address is changed to that of the\n   administrator of the mailing list.  This\
    \ causes DSNs and other\n   nondelivery reports resulting from delivery to the\
    \ list members to be\n   sent to the list administrator rather than the sender\
    \ of the original\n   message.\n   The DSN processing for aliases and mailing\
    \ lists is as follows:\n6.2.7.1 mailing lists\n   When a message is delivered\
    \ to a list submission address (i.e. placed\n   in the list's mailbox for incoming\
    \ mail, or accepted by the process\n   that redistributes the message to the list\
    \ subscribers), this is\n   considered final delivery for the original message.\
    \  If the NOTIFY\n   parameter for the list submission address contained the SUCCESS\n\
    \   keyword, a \"delivered\" DSN MUST be returned to the sender of the\n   original\
    \ message.\n   NOTE: Some mailing lists are able to reject message submissions,\n\
    \   based on the content of the message, the sender's address, or some\n   other\
    \ criteria.  While the interface between such a mailing list and\n   its MTA is\
    \ not well-defined, it is important that DSNs NOT be issued\n   by both the MTA\
    \ (to report successful delivery to the list), and the\n   list (to report message\
    \ rejection using a \"failure\" DSN.)\n   However, even if a \"delivered\" DSN\
    \ was issued by the MTA, a mailing\n   list which rejects a message submission\
    \ MAY notify the sender that\n   the message was rejected using an ordinary message\
    \ instead of a DSN.\n   Whenever a message is redistributed to an mailing list,\n\
    (a) The envelope return address is rewritten to point to the list\n    maintainer.\
    \  This address MAY be that of a process that recognizes\n    DSNs and processes\
    \ them automatically, but it MUST forward\n    unrecognized messages to the human\
    \ responsible for the list.\n(b) The ENVID, NOTIFY, RET, and ORCPT parameters\
    \ which accompany the\n    redistributed message MUST NOT be derived from those\
    \ of the original\n    message.\n(c) The NOTIFY and RET parameters MAY be specified\
    \ by the local\n    postmaster or the list administrator.  If ORCPT parameters\
    \ are\n    supplied during redistribution to the list subscribers, they SHOULD\n\
    \    contain the addresses of the list subscribers in the format used by\n   \
    \ the mailing list.\n6.2.7.2 single-recipient aliases\n   Under normal circumstances,\
    \ when a message arrives for an \"alias\"\n   which has a single forwarding address,\
    \ a DSN SHOULD NOT be issued.\n   Any ENVID, NOTIFY, RET, or ORCPT parameters\
    \ SHOULD be propagated with\n   the message as it is redistributed to the forwarding\
    \ address.\n6.2.7.3 multiple-recipient aliases\n   An \"alias\" with multiple\
    \ recipient addresses may be handled in any of\n   the following ways:\n(a) Any\
    \ ENVID, NOTIFY, RET, or ORCPT parameters are NOT propagated when\n    relaying\
    \ the message to any of the forwarding addresses.  If the\n    NOTIFY parameter\
    \ for the alias contained the SUCCESS keyword, the\n    MTA issues a \"relayed\"\
    \ DSN.  (In effect, the MTA treats the message\n    as if it were being relayed\
    \ into an environment that does not\n    support DSNs.)\n(b) Any ENVID, NOTIFY,\
    \ RET, or ORCPT parameters (or the equivalent\n    requests if the message is\
    \ gatewayed) are propagated to EXACTLY one\n    of the forwarding addresses. \
    \ No DSN is issued.  (This is\n    appropriate when aliasing is used to forward\
    \ a message to a\n    \"vacation\" auto-responder program in addition to the local\
    \ mailbox.)\n(c) Any ENVID, RET, or ORCPT parameters are propagated to all forwarding\n\
    \    addresses associated with that alias.  The NOTIFY parameter is\n    propagated\
    \ to the forwarding addresses, except that it any SUCCESS\n    keyword is removed.\
    \  If the original NOTIFY parameter for the alias\n    contained the SUCCESS keyword,\
    \ an \"expanded\" DSN is issued for the\n    alias.  If the NOTIFY parameter for\
    \ the alias did not contain the\n    SUCCESS keyword, no DSN is issued for the\
    \ alias.\n6.2.7.4 confidential forwarding addresses\n   If it is desired to maintain\
    \ the confidentiality of a recipient's\n   forwarding address, the forwarding\
    \ may be treated as if it were a\n   mailing list.  A DSN will be issued, if appropriate,\
    \ upon \"delivery\"\n   to the recipient address specified by the sender.  When\
    \ the message\n   is forwarded it will have a new envelope return address. Any\
    \ DSNs\n   which result from delivery failure of the forwarded message will not\n\
    \   be returned to the original sender of the message and thus not expose\n  \
    \ the recipient's forwarding address.\n6.2.8 DSNs describing delivery to multiple\
    \ recipients\n   A single DSN may describe attempts to deliver a message to multiple\n\
    \   recipients of that message.  If a DSN is issued for some recipients\n   in\
    \ an SMTP transaction and not for others according to the rules\n   above, the\
    \ DSN SHOULD NOT contain information for recipients for whom\n   DSNs would not\
    \ otherwise have been issued.\n6.3 Handling of messages from other sources\n \
    \  For messages which originated from \"local\" users (whatever that\n   means),\
    \ the specifications under which DSNs should be generated can\n   be communicated\
    \ to the MTA via any protocol agreed on between the\n   sender's mail composer\
    \ (user agent) and the MTA.  The local MTA can\n   then either relay the message,\
    \ or issue appropriate delivery status\n   notifications.  However, if such requests\
    \ are transmitted within the\n   message itself (for example in the message headers),\
    \ the requests\n   MUST be removed from the message before it is transmitted via\
    \ SMTP.\n   For messages gatewayed from non-SMTP sources and further relayed by\n\
    \   SMTP, the gateway SHOULD, using the SMTP extensions described here,\n   attempt\
    \ to provide the delivery reporting conditions expected by the\n   source mail\
    \ environment.  If appropriate, any DSNs returned to the\n   source environment\
    \ SHOULD be translated into the format expected in\n   that environment.\n6.4\
    \  Implementation limits\n   A conforming MTA MUST accept ESMTP parameters of\
    \ at least the\n   following sizes:\n   (a) ENVID parameter: 100 characters.\n\
    \   (b) NOTIFY parameter: 28 characters.\n   (c) ORCPT parameter: 500 characters.\n\
    \   (d) RET parameter: 8 characters.\n   The maximum sizes for the ENVID and ORCPT\
    \ parameters are intended to\n   be adequate for the transmission of \"foreign\"\
    \ envelope identifier and\n   original recipient addresses.  However, user agents\
    \ which use SMTP as\n   a message submission protocol SHOULD NOT generate ENVID\
    \ parameters\n   which are longer than 38 characters in length.\n   A conforming\
    \ MTA MUST be able to accept SMTP command-lines which are\n   at least 1036 characters\
    \ long (530 characters for the ORCPT and\n   NOTIFY parameters of the RCPT command,\
    \ in addition to the 512\n   characters required by [1]).  If other SMTP extensions\
    \ are supported\n   by the MTA, the MTA MUST be able to accept a command-line\
    \ large\n   enough for each SMTP command and any combination of ESMTP parameters\n\
    \   which may be used with that command.\n7.  Format of delivery notifications\n\
    \   The format of delivery status notifications is defined in [5], which\n   uses\
    \ the framework defined in [8].  Delivery status notifications are\n   to be returned\
    \ to the sender of the original message as outlined\n   below.\n7.1 SMTP Envelope\
    \ to be used with delivery status notifications\n   The DSN sender address (in\
    \ the SMTP MAIL command) MUST be a null\n   reverse-path (\"<>\"), as required\
    \ by section 5.3.3 of [9].  The DSN\n   recipient address (in the RCPT command)\
    \ is copied from the MAIL\n   command which accompanied the message for which\
    \ the DSN is being\n   issued.  When transmitting a DSN via SMTP, the RET parameter\
    \ MUST NOT\n   be used.  The NOTIFY parameter MAY be used, but its value MUST\
    \ be\n   NEVER.  The ENVID parameter (with a newly generated envelope-id)\n  \
    \ and/or ORCPT parameter MAY be used.\n7.2 Contents of the DSN\n   A DSN is transmitted\
    \ as a MIME message with a top-level content-type\n   of multipart/report (as\
    \ defined in [5]).\n   The multipart/report content-type may be used for any of\
    \ several\n   kinds of reports generated by the mail system.  When multipart/report\n\
    \   is used to convey a DSN, the report-type parameter of the\n   multipart/report\
    \ content-type is \"delivery-status\".\n   As described in [8], the first component\
    \ of a multipart/report\n   content-type is a human readable explanation of the\
    \ report.  For a\n   DSN, the second component of the multipart/report is of content-type\n\
    \   message/delivery-status (defined in [5]).  The third component of the\n  \
    \ multipart/report consists of the original message or some portion\n   thereof.\
    \  When the value of the RET parameter is FULL, the full\n   message SHOULD be\
    \ returned for any DSN which conveys notification of\n   delivery failure.  (However,\
    \ if the length of the message is greater\n   than some implementation-specified\
    \ length, the MTA MAY return only\n   the headers even if the RET parameter specified\
    \ FULL.)  If a DSN\n   contains no notifications of delivery failure, the MTA\
    \ SHOULD return\n   only the headers.\n   The third component must have an appropriate\
    \ content-type label.\n   Issues concerning selection of the content-type are\
    \ discussed in [8].\n7.3 Message/delivery-status fields\n   The message/delivery-status\
    \ content-type defines a number of fields,\n   with general specifications for\
    \ their contents.  The following\n   requirements for any DSNs generated in response\
    \ to a message received\n   by the SMTP protocol by a conforming SMTP server,\
    \ are in addition to\n   the requirements defined in [5] for the message/delivery-status\
    \ type.\n   When generating a DSN for a message which was received via the SMTP\n\
    \   protocol, a conforming MTA will generate the following fields of the\n   message/delivery-status\
    \ body part:\n(a) if an ENVID parameter was present on the MAIL command, an Original-\n\
    \    Envelope-ID field MUST be supplied, and the value associated with\n    the\
    \ ENVID parameter must appear in that field.  If the message was\n    received\
    \ via SMTP with no ENVID parameter, the Original-Envelope-ID\n    field MUST NOT\
    \ be supplied.\n    Since the ENVID parameter is encoded as xtext, but the Original-\n\
    \    Envelope-ID header is NOT encoded as xtext, the MTA must decode the\n   \
    \ xtext encoding when copying the ENVID value to the Original-\n    Envelope-ID\
    \ field.\n(b) The Reporting-MTA field MUST be supplied.  If Reporting MTA can\n\
    \    determine its fully-qualified Internet domain name, the MTA-name-\n    type\
    \ subfield MUST be \"dns\", and the field MUST contain the fully-\n    qualified\
    \ domain name of the Reporting MTA. If the fully-qualified\n    Internet domain\
    \ name of the Reporting MTA is not known (for example,\n    for an SMTP server\
    \ which is not directly connected to the Internet),\n    the Reporting-MTA field\
    \ may contain any string identifying the MTA,\n    however, in this case the MTA-name-type\
    \ subfield MUST NOT be \"dns\".\n    A MTA-name-type subfield value of \"x-local-hostname\"\
    \ is suggested.\n(c) Other per-message fields as defined in [5] MAY be supplied\
    \ as\n    appropriate.\n(d) If the ORCPT parameter was provided for this recipient,\
    \ the\n    Original-Recipient field MUST be supplied, with its value taken from\n\
    \    the ORCPT parameter.  If no ORCPT parameter was provided for this\n    recipient,\
    \ the Original-Recipient field MUST NOT appear.\n(e) The Final-Recipient field\
    \ MUST be supplied. It MUST contain the\n    recipient address from the message\
    \ envelope.  If the message was\n    received via SMTP, the address-type will\
    \ be \"rfc822\".\n(f) The Action field MUST be supplied.\n(g) The Status field\
    \ MUST be supplied, using a status-code from [10].\n    If there is no specific\
    \ code which suitably describes a delivery\n    failure, either 4.0.0 (temporary\
    \ failure), or 5.0.0 (permanent\n    failure) MUST be used.\n(h) For DSNs resulting\
    \ from attempts to relay a message to one or more\n    recipients via SMTP, the\
    \ Remote-MTA field MUST be supplied for each\n    of those recipients.  The mta-name-type\
    \ subfields of those Remote-\n    MTA fields will be \"dns\".\n(i) For DSNs resulting\
    \ from attempts to relay a message to one or more\n    recipients via SMTP, the\
    \ Diagnostic-Code MUST be supplied for each\n    of those recipients.  The diagnostic-type\
    \ subfield will be \"smtp\".\n    See section 9.2(a) of this document for a description\
    \ of the \"smtp\"\n    diagnostic-code.\n(j) For DSNs resulting from attempts\
    \ to relay a message to one or more\n    recipients via SMTP, an SMTP-Remote-Recipient\
    \ extension field MAY be\n    supplied for each recipient, which contains the\
    \ address of that\n    recpient which was presented to the remote SMTP server.\n\
    (k) Other per-recipient fields defined in [5] MAY appear, as\n    appropriate.\n\

    9. Appendix - Type-Name Definitions\n   The following type names are defined for\
    \ use in DSN fields generated\n   by conforming SMTP-based MTAs:\n9.1 \"rfc822\"\
    \ address-type\n   The \"rfc822\" address-type is to be used when reporting Internet\n\
    \   electronic mail address in the Original-Recipient and Final-Recipient\n  \
    \ DSN fields.\n(a) address-type name: rfc822\n(b) syntax for mailbox addresses\n\
    \    RFC822 mailbox addresses are generally expected to be of the form\n    [route]\
    \ addr-spec\n    where \"route\" and \"addr-spec\" are defined in [2], and the\
    \ \"domain\"\n    portions of both \"route\" and \"addr-spec\" are fully-qualified\
    \ domain\n    names that are registered in the DNS.  However, an MTA MUST NOT\n\
    \    modify an address obtained from the message envelope to force it to\n   \
    \ conform to syntax rules.\n(c) If addresses of this type are not composed entirely\
    \ of graphic\ncharacters from the US-ASCII repertoire, a specification for how\
    \ they\nare to be encoded as graphic US-ASCII characters in a DSN Original-\n\
    Recipient or Final-Recipient DSN field.\n    RFC822 addresses consist entirely\
    \ of graphic characters from the US-\n    ASCII repertoire, so no translation\
    \ is necessary.\n9.2 \"smtp\" diagnostic-type\n   The \"smtp\" diagnostic-type\
    \ is to be used when reporting SMTP reply-\n   codes in Diagnostic-Code DSN fields.\n\
    (a) diagnostic-type name: SMTP\n(b) A description of the syntax to be used for\
    \ expressing diagnostic\ncodes of this type as graphic characters from the US-ASCII\
    \ repertoire.\n    An SMTP diagnostic-code is of the form\n    *( 3*DIGIT \"-\"\
    \ *text ) 3*DIGIT SPACE *text\n    For a single-line SMTP reply to an SMTP command,\
    \ the diagnostic-code\n    SHOULD be an exact transcription of the reply.  For\
    \ multi-line SMTP\n    replies, it is necessary to insert a SPACE before each\
    \ line after\n    the first.  For example, an SMTP reply of:\n    550-mailbox\
    \ unavailable\n    550 user has moved with no forwarding address\n    could appear\
    \ as follows in a Diagnostic-Code DSN field:\n    Diagnostic-Code: smtp ; 550-mailbox\
    \ unavailable\n     550 user has moved with no forwarding address\n(c) A list\
    \ of valid diagnostic codes of this type and the meaning of\neach code.\n    SMTP\
    \ reply-codes are currently defined in [1], [4], and [9].\n    Additional codes\
    \ may be defined by other RFCs.\n9.3 \"dns\" MTA-name-type\n   The \"dns\" MTA-name-type\
    \ should be used in the Reporting-MTA field.\n   An MTA-name of type \"dns\" is\
    \ a fully-qualified domain name.  The name\n   must be registered in the DNS,\
    \ and the address Postmaster@{mta-name}\n   must be valid.\n(a) MTA-name-type\
    \ name: dns\n(b) A description of the syntax of MTA names of this type, using\
    \ BNF,\nregular expressions, ASN.1, or other non-ambiguous language.\n    MTA\
    \ names of type \"dns\" SHOULD be valid Internet domain names.  If\n    such domain\
    \ names are not available, a domain-literal containing the\n    internet protocol\
    \ address is acceptable.  Such domain names\n    generally conform to the following\
    \ syntax:\n    domain = real-domain / domain-literal\n    real-domain = sub-domain\
    \ *(\".\" sub-domain)\n    sub-domain = atom\n    domain-literal = \"[\" 1*3DIGIT\
    \ 3(\".\" 1*3DIGIT) \"]\"\n    where \"atom\" and \"DIGIT\" are defined in [2].\n\
    (c) If MTA names of this type do not consist entirely of graphic\ncharacters from\
    \ the US-ASCII repertoire, a specification for how an MTA\nname of this type should\
    \ be expressed as a sequence of graphic US-ASCII\ncharacters.\n    MTA names of\
    \ type \"dns\" consist entirely of graphic US-ASCII\n    characters, so no translation\
    \ is needed.\n10. Appendix - Example\n   This example traces the flow of a single\
    \ message addressed to\n   multiple recipients.  The message is sent by Alice@Pure-Heart.ORG\
    \ to\n   Bob@Big-Bucks.COM, Carol@Ivory.EDU, Dana@Ivory.EDU,\n   Eric@Bombs.AF.MIL,\
    \ Fred@Bombs.AF.MIL, and George@Tax-ME.GOV, with a\n   variety of per-recipient\
    \ options.  The message is successfully\n   delivered to Bob, Dana (via a gateway),\
    \ Eric, and Fred.  Delivery\n   fails for Carol and George.\n   NOTE: Formatting\
    \ rules for RFCs require that no line be longer than\n   72 characters.  Therefore,\
    \ in the following examples, some SMTP\n   commands longer than 72 characters\
    \ are printed on two lines, with the\n   first line ending in \"\\\".  In an actual\
    \ SMTP transaction, such a\n   command would be sent as a single line (i.e. with\
    \ no embedded CRLFs),\n   and without the \"\\\" character that appears in these\
    \ examples.\n10.1 Submission\n   Alice's user agent sends the message to the SMTP\
    \ server at Pure-\n   Heart.ORG.  Note that while this example uses SMTP as a\
    \ mail\n   submission protocol, other protocols could also be used.\n<<< 220 Pure-Heart.ORG\

    \   The SMTP at Pure-Heart.ORG then relays the message to Big-Bucks.COM.\n   (For\
    \ the purpose of this example, mail.Big-Bucks.COM is the primary\n   mail exchanger\
    \ for Big-Bucks.COM).\n<<< 220 mail.Big-Bucks.COM says hello\n>>> EHLO Pure-Heart.ORG\n\

    \ received\n>>> QUIT\n<<< 221 bcnu\n10.3 Relay to Ivory.EDU\n   The SMTP at Pure-Heart.ORG\
    \ relays the message to Ivory.EDU, which (as\n   it happens) is a gateway to a\
    \ LAN-based mail system that accepts SMTP\n   mail and supports the DSN extension.\n\

    \ accept mail for\n   Carol@Ivory.EDU, and the sender specified NOTIFY=FAILURE,\
    \ the\n   sender-SMTP (in this case Pure-Heart.ORG) must generate a DSN.\n10.4\
    \ Relay to Bombs.AF.MIL\n   The SMTP at Pure-Heart.ORG relays the message to Bombs.AF.MIL,\
    \ which\n   does not support the SMTP extension.  Because the sender specified\n\
    \   NOTIFY=NEVER for recipient Fred@Bombs.AF.MIL, the SMTP at Pure-\n   Heart.ORG\
    \ chooses to send the message for that recipient in a\n   separate transaction\
    \ with a reverse-path of <>.\n<<< 220-Bombs.AF.MIL reporting for duty.\n<<< 220\

    \ closing connection\n10.5 Forward from George@Tax-ME.GOV to Sam@Boondoggle.GOV\n\
    \   The SMTP at Pure-Heart.ORG relays the message to Tax-ME.GOV.  (this\n   step\
    \ is not shown).  MTA Tax-ME.GOV then forwards the message to\n   Sam@Boondoggle.GOV\
    \ (shown below).  Both Tax-ME.GOV and Pure-Heart.ORG\n   support the SMTP DSN\
    \ extension.  Note that RET, ENVID, and ORCPT all\n   retain their original values.\n\
    <<< 220 BoonDoggle.GOV says hello\n>>> EHLO Pure-Heart.ORG\n<<< 250-mail.Big-Bucks.COM\n\
