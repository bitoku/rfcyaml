This RFC describes the interface to the IBM 5250 Telnet implementation.
The purpose of this memo is to describe the details of the interface so that a person wanting to implement a client Telnet which emulates an IBM 5250 work station would be able to do so.
This memo does not describe all of the 5250 commands, aid codes, and other information specific to the 5250 data stream.
That information is contained in the IBM 5250 Information Display System, Functions Reference Manual, IBM publication number SA21 9247.
Corrections and additions to this manual are documented in this RFC in section 5.
No new Telnet options are defined for 5250 mode of operation.
However, to enable 5250 mode, both the client and server must agree to at least support the Binary, End Of Record (EOR), and Terminal  Type Telnet options.
The complete list of 5250 terminal types is maintained in the Assigned Numbers RFC and includes the following: IBM 5555 C01   24 x 80 Double Byte Character Set color display IBM 5555 B01   24 x 80 Double Byte Character Set (DBCS)
27 x 132 color display
27 x 132 monochrome display IBM 3180
color display IBM 5291 1
24 x 80 monochrome display IBM 5251 11
24 x 80 monochrome display An example of a typical negotiation process to establish 5250 mode of operation is shown below.
In this example, the server initiates the negotiation by sending the DO TERMINAL TYPE request.
Server: IAC DO TERMINAL TYPE Client:
IAC WILL TERMINAL TYPE Server:
IAC SB TERMINAL TYPE SEND IAC SE Client
: IAC SB TERMINAL TYPE IS IBM 5251
11 IAC SE (The client has specified its terminal type is an IBM 5251 11)
Server: IAC DO END OF RECORD Client:
IAC WILL END OF RECORD Server
: IAC WILL END OF RECORD Client: IAC DO END OF RECORD
(The server and client have both agreed to transmit EORs)
: IAC DO TRANSMIT BINARY Client:
IAC WILL TRANSMIT BINARY Server:
IAC WILL TRANSMIT BINARY Client:
IAC DO TRANSMIT BINARY (The server and client have both agreed to binary transmission)
The actual data stream that is exchanged between the client and server is composed of a header followed by the 5250 work station data stream.
For information about the 5250 work station data stream refer to the IBM 5250 Information Display System, Functions Reference Manual (SA21 9247).
The header which prefixes the 5250 data stream was originally designed for the 5250 Display Station Pass Through (DSPT) application.
5250 DSPT is an application similar to Telnet which runs on the IBM AS/400, System/36, and System/38 over an SNA network.
This header is designed to be variable in length and is composed of two parts.
The first, fixed part is always 6 octets long and has the following format:
The length is calculated BEFORE doubling any IAC characters in the data stream.
The length does not include the <IAC><EOR> that is appended to the end of the data stream to mark the end of this logical record.
The length is specified with the most significant octet first.
For example, a length of 36 (decimal) would be specified as '0024'X. Record Type:  16 bits This field indicates the SNA record type.
It should always be set to '12A0'X to indicate the General Data Stream (GDS) record type.
Reserved:  16 bits This field is currently not used.
The second part of the header is designed to be variable in length.
The length of this variable part is specified in the first octet.
Currently this portion of the header will always be 4 octets long and has the following format:
The length, in octets, of the variable portion of the header.
This bit is set to indicate a data stream output error.
The negative response code is sent as data following the opcode field.
This bit is set to indicate that the 5250 attention key was pressed.
These bits are reserved (set to zero).
This bit is set to indicate that the 5250 System Request key was pressed.
This bit is set to indicate that the 5250 Test Request key was pressed.
This bit is set to indicate the Help in Error State function.
The error code is sent as data following the header and is a four digit packed decimal number.
For example, an error code of '0005'X indicates the operator attempted to type in an area of the display that is not enabled for input.
These bits are reserved (set to zero).
This field contains the operation code.
It is set to indicate the type of operation requested by the sender.
The following are the valid values: '00'X:  No Operation '01'X:  Invite Operation '02'X:  Output Only '03'X:  Put/Get Operation '04'X:  Save Screen Operation '05'X:  Restore Screen Operation '06'X
:  Read Immediate Operation '07'X
:  Reserved '08'X:  Read Screen Operation '09'X:  Reserved '0A'X:  Cancel Invite Operation '0B'X:
The actual 5250 work station data stream will immediately follow the opcode field in the header and will be terminated by the <IAC><EOR> pair.
For some operations the header will be immediately followed by an <IAC><EOR> without any 5250 work station data stream in between.
For example, the following request to turn on the message light could be sent by the server: 000A 12A0 0000 0400 000B
In this example the requested operation is indicated by the opcode and there is no associated work station data stream.
The following examples illustrate the flow of data between the client and server for some of the more common operations.
These examples are intended to show the order in which the logical records are sent between the client and server and the content of those records.
The hex representation of the records which are exchanged between the client and server is shown.
The way in which a client implements the various operations will differ between implementations and those details are not discussed here.
In these examples, when the value of a field is dependent on the length of the screen data for a particular logical record, it will be represented as 'LLLL'.
4.1  Query Device Example A Query command may be sent by the server system in order to determine the attributes of the device it is talking to.
When a client receives a Query command, it must send the Query Reply back to the server.
See section 5 for a complete description of the format for the Query command and Query Reply.
: Sends Write Structured    001112A0 00000400 000304F3
The server will send a Cancel Invite when it needs to reverse the normal flow direction.
When a client receives a Cancel Invite, it should reply with a Cancel Invite and not send any user data until the server has once again "invited" the work station.
A work station is said to be "invited" when the server has sent a read command to the client.
Invite flow is as follows:
Opcode   Cancel Invite to indicate that the work station is no longer invited.
The 5250 System Request operation is invoked when a client wants to interrupt the server job to perform some function.
It is possible for a client to include user data in this record following the header.
This data would be interpreted by the server as an option to be selected from the system request menu.
If this were the case, the server would not send the system request menu and the flow would continue based on the option selected.
For this example, the client does not send any user data and the flow would continue as follows:
Opcode   Cancel Invite to indicate that the work station is no longer invited.
00040402 FFEF command with Opcode   Save Screen.
Client: Sends the screen image    LLLL12A0 00000400 00040412 to be saved.
User Input> FFEF Note: What happens next will depend on the System Request option selected by the user.
After any System Request processing has completed, the server will continue with the following restore operation:
(No reply is necessary from the client)
Data Tag (MDT) command, opcode   Invite.
At this point the client would "invite" the workstation and enter the state that it was in prior to the System Request key being hit.
This section is intended to be used as an addendum to the IBM 5250 Information Display System, Functions Reference Manual.
Described here are enhancements to the 5250 data stream which are not yet documented in the current version of that manual.
The current version of that manual at the time of this writing has the IBM publication number SA21 9247 6.
Also described in this section are corrections to erroneous information contained in SA21 9247 6.
Listed below are the specific corrections and enhancements, with an approximate page number reference to the above manual.
5.1  Errors or Inconsistencies in SA21 9247 6
The Insert Cursor (IC) order on pages 2 136 and 2 137 is incorrectly listed with a value of Hex 03; the correct value is Hex 13.
On page 2 137, the listed "Restrictions" for the Insert Cursor, Repeat to Address, and Set Buffer Address orders should be updated to describe how Row and Column values must be valid for the current display screen size (either 24 x 80 or 27 x 132).
5.2  Enhancements to Existing 5250
A new flag is added to the second byte of the Control Character on page 2 40.
This flag is used to specify whether the cursor should be moved or not moved at the end of the Write to Display processing.
Bit 1 of the second byte, which was previously reserved, will now be used for this flag.
If bit 1 is a 0, the cursor continues to be moved to the system
IC address on a Lock to Unlock keyboard transition.
If bit 1 is a 1, the cursor is not moved.
A new Field Control Word (FCW) will be added on page 2 65 to indicate an entry field contains transparent data.
This means the entry field contents are sent from the display screen directly to the host at read time with no formatting.
Therefore, an entry field can contain any values (Hex 00 to Hex FF).
A transparent field is indicated by a Hex 84xx FCW, where xx is any value.
Note: unpredictable results will occur if a field is defined as both signed numeric and a transparent field.
The Read Immediate, Read Input Fields, and Read MDT Fields commands have been enhanced to include support for transparent fields (page 2 5).
If a transparent FCW is found for an input field, the field data is not formatted (for example, nulls are not converted to blanks).
The restriction listed for the Set Buffer Address (SBA) order (page 2 138) on the column address equal to zero is no longer always the case.
A reference to Start of Field
(SF) row 1/column 1 field support should be made.
A note should be added in SF to describe Row 1/Column 1 field support.
A Row 1/Column 1 field is defined by a SBA of row 1/column 0, followed by an SF.
For a Row 1/Column 1 input field, the first input capable position is row 1/column 1.
If the SF defines an input field, the screen attribute is not allowed to be nondisplay.
Writing of the screen attribute is suppressed for a Row 1/Column 1 field and the attribute discarded.
New 5250 Data Stream Commands/Orders
The Read MDT Fields Alternate input command has been added.
It is the same as the Read MDT Fields command except: The command is indicated by a X'82' Leading and embedded nulls within the field remain as nulls
The Read MDT Fields Immediate Alternate input command has been added.
It is the same as the Read MDT Fields Alternate command except:
The command is indicated by a X'83' The command is an immediate read command like Read Immediate; therefore, no control characters follow the command byte, field data is returned immediately, and the aid code is X'00'.
The Move Cursor order (MC) has been added (page 2 137).
The MC order moves the cursor to the location specified by the two bytes following the order.
Byte 1 gives the row address and byte 2 gives the column address.
The MC order is useful when the cursor is to be moved without affecting the system IC address.
The MC order is unaffected by the Write to Display control character values including the "Leave Cursor" flag (CC1 bit 1).
If more than one MC or IC are found in the data stream, the cursor will move to the address specified in the last MC or IC.
A parameter error will be posted when: There are fewer then two bytes following the order.
The row address is zero or greater than the number of rows on the display screen.
The column address is zero or greater than the number of columns on the display screen.
The address specified by the MC order is used to move the cursor when the Write to Display is completed.
The Transparent Data order (TD) has been added (page 2 137).
The TD order is followed by two length bytes and transparent data.
The transparent data is written to the display screen at the current display address; any values (Hex 00 to Hex FF) are allowed in the transparent data.
All length values are valid as long as the end of the display screen is not overwritten.
A parameter error will be posted when: There are fewer then two bytes following the order.
There are fewer bytes in the data stream then specified in the length field.
Attempting to write beyond the end of the display screen.
Transparent data data (not counting length bytes)
The transparent data is written to the display.
The Query command is a new input command (page 2 5) and is used by the server to obtain information on the functional capabilities of the client 5250 display.
When the client receives a Query command, the client sends a Query Reply describing its capabilities back to the server.
The Query command must follow an Escape ('04'X) and Write Structured Field command ('F3'X).
The format of the Query command is as follows:
The format of the Query Reply is as follows:
Cursor Row/Column (set to zero)
X'003A'   Length of Query Reply 5
Local ASCII Controller X'0101'   SDLC/X.21/X.25 Twinax Controller (5394 emulating a 5294)
