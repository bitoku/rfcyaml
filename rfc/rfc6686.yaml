  contents:
  - "Abstract\n   In 2006, the IETF published a suite of protocol documents comprising\n\
    \   the Sender Policy Framework (SPF) and Sender ID: two proposed email\n   authentication\
    \ protocols.  Both of these protocols enable one to\n   publish, via the Domain\
    \ Name System, a policy declaring which mail\n   servers were authorized to send\
    \ email on behalf of the domain name\n   being queried.  There was concern that\
    \ the two would conflict in some\n   significant operational situations, interfering\
    \ with message\n   delivery.\n   The IESG required all of these documents (RFC\
    \ 4405, RFC 4406, RFC\n   4407, and RFC 4408) to be published as Experimental\
    \ RFCs and\n   requested that the community observe deployment and operation of\
    \ the\n   protocols over a period of two years from the date of publication to\n\
    \   determine a reasonable path forward.\n   After six years, sufficient experience\
    \ and evidence have been\n   collected that the experiments thus created can be\

- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   In April 2006, the IETF published the [SPF] and Sender ID\
    \ email\n   authentication protocols, the latter consisting of three documents\n\
    \   ([SUBMITTER], [SENDER-ID], and [PRA]).  Both of these protocols\n   enable\
    \ one to publish, via the Domain Name System, a policy declaring\n   which mail\
    \ servers are authorized to send email on behalf of the\n   selected domain name.\n\
    \   Consensus did not clearly support one protocol over the other, and\n   there\
    \ was significant concern that the two would conflict in some\n   significant\
    \ operational situations, interfering with message\n   delivery.  The IESG required\
    \ the publication of all of these\n   documents as Experimental, and requested\
    \ that the community observe\n   deployment and operation of the protocols over\
    \ a period of two years\n   from the date of publication in order to determine\
    \ a reasonable path\n   forward.\n   In line with the IESG's request to evaluate\
    \ after a period of time,\n   this document concludes the experiments by presenting\
    \ evidence\n   regarding both deployment and comparative effect of the two\n \
    \  protocols.  At the end, it presents conclusions based on the data\n   collected.\n\
    \   It is important to note that this document makes no direct technical\n   comparison\
    \ of the two protocols in terms of correctness, weaknesses,\n   or use case coverage.\
    \  The email community at large has already done\n   that through its deployment\
    \ choices.  Rather, the analysis presented\n   here is merely an observation of\
    \ what has been deployed and supported\n   in the time since the protocols were\
    \ published and lists conclusions\n   based on those observations.\n   The data\
    \ collected and presented here are presumed to be a reasonable\n   representative\
    \ view of the global deployment data, which could never\n   itself be fully surveyed\
    \ within a reasonable period of time.\n"
- title: 2.  Definitions
  contents:
  - "2.  Definitions\n   The term \"RRTYPE\" is used to refer to a Domain Name System\
    \ ([DNS])\n   Resource Record (RR) type.  These are always expressed internally\
    \ in\n   software as numbers, assigned according to the procedures in\n   [DNS-IANA]\
    \ Assigned RRTYPEs also have names.  The two of interest in\n   this work are\
    \ the TXT RRTYPE (16) and the SPF RRTYPE (99).\n"

    \ to determine what\n   parts of the two protocol suites are in general use as\
    \ well as\n   related issues like [DNS] support.\n"
- title: 3.1.  DNS Resource Record Types
  contents:
  - "3.1.  DNS Resource Record Types\n   Three large-scale DNS surveys were run that\
    \ looked for the two\n   supported kinds of RRTYPEs that can contain SPF policy\
    \ statements.\n   These surveys selected substantial sets of distinct domain names\
    \ from\n   email headers and logs over long periods, regardless of whether the\n\
    \   DNS data for those domains included A, MX, or any other RRTYPEs.  The\n  \
    \ nameservers for these domains were queried, asking for both of the\n   RRTYPEs\
    \ that could be used for SPF and/or Sender ID.\n   In the tables below, replies\
    \ were counted only if they included\n   prefixes that indicated the record was\
    \ intended to be of a form\n   defined in either [SPF] or [SENDER-ID], though\
    \ complete syntax\n   validation of the replies was not done.  That is, the records\
    \ started\n   either \"v=spf1\" or \"spf2.0/\", or they were not counted as replies.\n\
    \   The tables are broken down into three parts: (a) the size of the\n   sample\
    \ set, (b) a report about RRTYPE use independent of content, and\n   (c) a report\
    \ about content independent of RRTYPE.\n   \"SPF+TXT\" indicates the count of\
    \ domains where both types were in\n   use.\n   DNS Survey #1 (Cisco)\n     +------------------+-----------+-------+\n\

    \ 7,285 |  2.7% |\n     +------------------+-----------+-------+\n   This survey\
    \ selected its domains from data observed in email headers\n   and previous SPF\
    \ and Sender ID evaluations, collected from 23\n   reporting hosts across a handful\
    \ of unrelated operators over a period\n   of 22 months.\n   During this second\
    \ survey, some domains were observed to provide\n   immediate answers for RRTYPE\
    \ 16 queries, but would time out waiting\n   for replies to RRTYPE 99 queries.\
    \  For example, it was observed that\n   4,360 (over 1.6%) distinct domains in\
    \ the survey returned a result of\n   some kind (a record or an error) for the\
    \ TXT query in time N, while\n   the SPF query ultimately failed after at least\
    \ time 4N.\n   DNS Survey #3 (Hotmail)\n     +------------------+-----------+-------+\n\
    \     | Domains queried  |   100,000 |   -   |\n     +------------------+-----------+-------+\n\
    \     | TXT replies      |    46,221 | 46.2% |\n     | SPF replies      |    \
    \   954 | <1.0% |\n     | SPF+TXT replies  |     1,383 |  1.4% |\n     +------------------+-----------+-------+\n\
    \   Hotmail's domain set was selected from live email traffic at the time\n  \
    \ the sample was extracted.  Only the RRTYPE portion of the report is\n   available.\n\
    \   A separate survey was done of queries for RRTYPE 16 and RRTYPE 99\n   records\
    \ by observing nameserver traffic records.  Only a few queries\n   were ever received\
    \ for RRTYPE 99 records, and those almost\n   exclusively came from one large\
    \ email service provider that queried\n   for both RRTYPEs.  The vast majority\
    \ of other querying agents only\n   ever requested RRTYPE 16.\n"
- title: 3.2.  Implementations
  contents:
  - "3.2.  Implementations\n   It is likely impossible to determine from a survey\
    \ which Mail\n   Transfer Agents (MTAs) have SPF and/or Sender ID checking enabled\
    \ at\n   message ingress since it does not appear, for example, in the reply\n\
    \   to the EHLO command from extended [SMTP].  Therefore, we relied on\n   evidence\
    \ found via web searches and observed the following:\n   o  A web site [SID-IMPL]\
    \ dedicated to highlighting Sender ID\n      implementations, last updated in\
    \ late 2007, listed 13 commercial\n      implementations, which we assume means\
    \ they implement the\n      Purported Responsible Address (PRA) checks.  At least\
    \ one of them\n      is known no longer to be supported by its vendor.  There\
    \ were no\n      free open-source implementations listed.\n   o  The [OPENSPF]\
    \ web site maintains a list of implementations of SPF.\n      At the time of this\
    \ document's writing, it listed six libraries,\n      22 MTAs with built-in SPF\
    \ implementations, and numerous patches\n      for MTAs and mail clients.  The\
    \ set included a mix of commercial\n      and free open-source implementations.\n"
- title: 3.3.  The SUBMITTER SMTP Extension
  contents:
  - "3.3.  The SUBMITTER SMTP Extension\n   The PRA is the output of a heuristic that\
    \ seeks to scan a message\n   header and extract from it the email address most\
    \ likely to be the\n   one responsible for injection of that message into the\
    \ mail stream.\n   The SUBMITTER extension to SMTP is a mechanism to provide an\
    \ early\n   hint (i.e., as part of the MAIL command in an SMTP session) to the\n\
    \   receiving MTA of what the PRA would be on full receipt of the\n   message.\n\
    \   In a review of numerous MTAs in current or recent use, two\n   (Santronics\
    \ WinServer and McAfee MxLogic) were found to contain\n   implementations of the\
    \ SMTP SUBMITTER extension as part of the MTA\n   service, which could act as\
    \ an enabler to Sender ID.\n   An unknown number of SMTP clients implement the\
    \ SUBMITTER SMTP\n   extension.  Although information from MTA logs indicates\
    \ substantial\n   use of the SMTP extension, it is not possible to determine whether\n\
    \   the usage is from multiple instances of the same SMTP client or\n   different\
    \ SMTP client implementations.\n   An active survey of MTAs accessible over the\
    \ Internet was performed.\n   The MTAs selected were found by querying for MX\
    \ and A resource\n   records of a subset of all domains observed by The Trusted\
    \ Domain\n   Project's data collection system in the preceding 20 months.  The\n\
    \   results were as follows:\n   SUBMITTER Survey (The Trusted Domain Project)\n\
    \     +-------------------+-----------+-------+\n     | MTAs selected     |  \
    \ 484,980 |   -   |\n     | MTAs responding   |   371,779 | 76.7% |\n     | SUBMITTER\
    \ enabled |    17,425 |  4.7% |\n     | MXLogic banner    |    16,914 |  4.6%\
    \ |\n     +-------------------+-----------+-------+\n   Note: The bottom two rows\
    \ indicate the percentage of responding MTAs\n   with the stated property, not\
    \ the percentage of selected MTAs.\n   Based on the SMTP banner presented upon\
    \ connection, the entire set of\n   SUBMITTER-enabled MTAs consisted of the two\
    \ found during the review\n   (above) and a third whose identity could not be\
    \ positively\n   determined.\n   Of those few responding MTAs advertising the\
    \ SUBMITTER SMTP\n   extension, 97% were different instances of one MTA.  The\
    \ service\n   operating that MTA (MXLogic, a division of McAfee) reported that\n\
    \   about 11% of all observed SMTP sessions involved SMTP clients that\n   make\
    \ use of the SUBMITTER extension.  Note that this represents about\n   11% of\
    \ the clients of 4.6% of the responding MTAs in the survey.\n"
- title: 4.  Evidence of Differences
  contents:
  - "4.  Evidence of Differences\n   Separate surveys from Hotmail and The Trusted\
    \ Domain Project compared\n   the cases where the PRA (used by Sender ID) and\
    \ the RFC5321.MailFrom\n   address (used by SPF) differed.  The results of these\
    \ tests showed\n   that, at least 50% of the time, the two addresses were the\
    \ same, but,\n   beyond that, the percentage varied substantially from one sampling\n\
    \   location to the next due to the nature of the mail streams they each\n   receive.\n\
    \   Further, The Trusted Domain Project analyzed approximately 150,000\n   messages\
    \ and found that in more than 95% of those cases, Sender ID\n   and SPF reach\
    \ the same conclusion about a message, meaning either\n   both protocols return\
    \ a \"pass\" result or both return a \"fail\" result.\n   Note that this does\
    \ not include an evaluation of whether \"fail\" meant\n   spam or other abusive\
    \ mail was thus detected or that \"pass\" mail is\n   good mail; it is merely\
    \ a measure of how often the two protocols\n   concurred.  The data set yielding\
    \ this response could not further\n   characterize the cases in which the answers\
    \ differed.\n   A second analysis of the same nature by Hotmail found that the\
    \ two\n   protocols yielded the same result approximately 80% of the time when\n\
    \   evaluated across billions of messages.\n   Anecdotally, the differences in\
    \ conclusions have not been noted as\n   causing significant operational problems\
    \ by the email-receiving\n   community.\n"
- title: 5.  Analysis
  contents:
  - "5.  Analysis\n   Given the six years that have passed since the publication of\
    \ the\n   Experimental RFCs, and the evidence reported in the earlier sections\n\
    \   of this document, the following analysis appears to be supported:\n   1. \
    \ There has not been substantial adoption of the RRTYPE 99 (SPF)\n       DNS resource\
    \ record.  In all large-scale surveys performed for\n       this work, fewer than\
    \ 2% of responding domains published RRTYPE\n       99 records, and almost no\
    \ clients requested them.\n   2.  Of the DNS resource records retrieved, fewer\
    \ than 3% included\n       specific requests for processing of messages using\
    \ the PRA\n       algorithm, which is an essential part of Sender ID.\n   3. \
    \ Although the two protocols often used different email address\n       fields\
    \ as the subject being evaluated, no data collected showed\n       any substantial\
    \ operational benefit, in terms of improved\n       accuracy, to using one mechanism\
    \ over the other.\n   4.  A review of known implementations shows significant\
    \ support for\n       both protocols, though there were more implementations in\
    \ support\n       of SPF than of Sender ID.  Further, the SPF implementations\n\
    \       showed better upkeep and current interest than the Sender ID\n       implementations.\n\
    \   5.  A survey of running MTAs shows fewer than 5% of them advertised\n    \
    \   the SUBMITTER extension, which is a Sender ID enabler.  Only\n       three\
    \ implementations of it were found.\n   6.  There remain obstacles to deployment\
    \ of protocols that use DNS\n       RRTYPEs other than the most common ones, including\
    \ firewalls and\n       DNS servers that block or discard requests for unknown\
    \ RRTYPEs.\n       Further, few if any web-based DNS configuration tools offer\n\
    \       support for RRTYPE 99 records.\n"
- title: 6.  Conclusions
  contents:
  - "6.  Conclusions\n   In light of the analysis in the previous section, the following\n\
    \   conclusions are supported:\n   1.  The experiments comprising the series of\
    \ RFCs defining the\n       SUBMITTER SMTP extension (RFC4405), the Sender ID\
    \ mechanism\n       (RFC4406), the Purported Responsible Address algorithm (RFC4407),\n\
    \       and SPF (RFC4408), should be considered concluded.\n   2.  The absence\
    \ of significant adoption of the RRTYPE 99 DNS Resource\n       Record suggests\
    \ that it has not attracted enough support to be\n       useful.\n   3.  Unavailability\
    \ of software implementing the protocols was not a\n       gating factor in terms\
    \ of the selection of which to use.\n   4.  The absence of significant adoption\
    \ of the [SUBMITTER] extension,\n       [SENDER-ID], and [PRA], indicates that\
    \ there is not a strong\n       community deploying and using these protocols.\n\
    \   5.  [SPF] has widespread implementation and deployment, comparable to\n  \
    \     that of many Standards Track protocols.\n   Appendix A is offered as a cautionary\
    \ review of problems that\n   affected the process of developing SPF and Sender\
    \ ID in terms of\n   their use of the DNS.\n"

- title: Appendix A.  Background on the RRTYPE Issue
  contents:
  - "Appendix A.  Background on the RRTYPE Issue\n   SPF was originally created by\
    \ a community of interested developers\n   outside the IETF, with the intent of\
    \ bringing it to the IETF for\n   standardization after it had become relatively\
    \ mature and ready for\n   the IETF Standards process.\n   At the time of SPF's\
    \ initial development, the prospect of getting an\n   RRTYPE allocated for SPF\
    \ was not seriously considered, partly because\n   doing so had high barriers\
    \ to entry.  As a result, at the time it was\n   brought to the IETF for development\
    \ and publication, there was\n   already a substantial and growing installed base\
    \ that had SPF running\n   using TXT RRs.  Eventually, the application was made\
    \ for the new\n   RRTYPE as a result of pressure from the DNS experts in the community,\n\
    \   who insisted upon doing so as the preferred path toward using the DNS\n  \
    \ for storing such things as policy data.\n   Later, after RRTYPE 99 was assigned\
    \ (long after IESG approval of\n   [SPF], in fact), a plan was put into place\
    \ to effect a gradual\n   transition to using RRTYPE 99 instead of using RRTYPE\
    \ 16.  This plan\n   failed to take effect for four primary reasons:\n   1.  there\
    \ was hesitation to make the transition because existing\n       nameservers (and,\
    \ in fact, DNS-aware firewalls) would drop or\n       reject requests for unknown\
    \ RRTYPEs (see Section 3 for evidence\n       of this), which means successful\
    \ rollout of a new RRTYPE is\n       contingent upon widespread adoption of updated\
    \ nameservers and\n       resolver functions;\n   2.  many DNS provisioning tools\
    \ (e.g., web interfaces to controlling\n       DNS zone data) were, and still\
    \ are, typically lethargic about\n       adding support for new RRTYPEs;\n   3.\
    \  the substantial deployed base was already using RRTYPE 16, and it\n       was\
    \ working just fine, leading to inertia;\n   4.  [SPF] itself included a faulty\
    \ transition plan, likely because of\n       the late addition of a requirement\
    \ to develop one -- it said:\n         An SPF-compliant domain name SHOULD have\
    \ SPF records of both RR\n         types.  A compliant domain name MUST have a\
    \ record of at least\n         one type.\n       which means both can claim to\
    \ be fully compliant while failing\n       utterly to interoperate.  Publication\
    \ occurred without proper\n       IETF review, so this was not detected prior\
    \ to publication.\n   It is likely that this will happen again if the bar to creating\
    \ new\n   RRTYPEs even for experimental development purposes is not lowered,\n\
    \   and handling of unknown RRTYPEs in software becomes generally more\n   graceful.\
    \  Also, important in this regard is encouragement of support\n   for new RRTYPEs\
    \ in DNS record provisioning tools.\n   Fortunately, in the meantime, the requirements\
    \ for new RRTYPE\n   assignments was changed to be less stringent (see [DNS-IANA]).\
    \  Also,\n   the publication of [DNS-EXPAND] has provided some useful guidance\
    \ in\n   this regard.  However, there is still a common perception that adding\n\
    \   new types of data to the DNS will face resistance due to the lack of\n   appropriate\
    \ software support.\n   There are DNS experts within the community that will undoubtedly\n\
    \   point to DNS servers and firewalls that mistreat queries for unknown\n   RRTYPEs,\
    \ and to overly simplistic provisioning tools, and claim they\n   are broken as\
    \ a way of answering these concerns.  This is undoubtedly\n   correct, but the\
    \ reality is that they are among us and likely will be\n   for some time, and\
    \ this needs to be considered as new protocols and\n   IETF procedures are developed.\n"
