  contents:
  - "1.1.  MPEG2 Transport Stream Decodability Metrics\n   The European Telecommunications\
    \ Standards Institute (ETSI) has\n   defined a set of syntax and information consistency\
    \ tests and\n   corresponding indicators [ETSI] that are recommended for the\n\
    \   monitoring of MPEG2 Transport Streams [ISO-IEC.13818-1.2007].  The\n   tests\
    \ and corresponding indicators are grouped according to priority:\n   First priority:\
    \  Necessary for decodability (basic monitoring)\n   Second priority:  Recommended\
    \ for continuous or periodic monitoring\n   Third priority:  Recommended for application-dependent\
    \ monitoring\n   This memo defines a new block type for use with MPEG2 Transport\n\
    \   Streams [ISO-IEC.13818-1.2007] to augment those defined in [RFC3611].\n  \
    \ The new block type supports reporting of the number of occurrences of\n   each\
    \ Program Specific Information (PSI) indicator in the first and\n   second priorities\
    \ listed in Sections 5.2.1 and 5.2.2, respectively,\n   of [ETSI].  The third\
    \ priority indicators are not supported.  The\n   metrics defined here supplement\
    \ information from the PSI-Independent\n   Decodability Statistics Metrics Block\
    \ [RFC6990].\n"
- title: 1.2.  RTCP and RTCP XR Reports
  contents:
  - "1.2.  RTCP and RTCP XR Reports\n   The use of RTCP for reporting is defined in\
    \ [RFC3550].  [RFC3611]\n   defines an extensible structure for reporting using\
    \ an RTCP Extended\n   Report (XR).  This document defines a new Extended Report\
    \ block for\n   use with [RFC3550] and [RFC3611].\n"
- title: 1.3.  Performance Metrics Framework
  contents:
  - "1.3.  Performance Metrics Framework\n   The Performance Metrics Framework [RFC6390]\
    \ provides guidance on the\n   definition and specification of performance metrics.\
    \  The RTP\n   Monitoring Architectures [RFC6792] provides guidelines for RTCP\
    \ XR\n   block formats.  The new report block described in this memo is in\n \
    \  compliance with the monitoring architecture specified in [RFC6792]\n   and\
    \ the Performance Metrics Framework [RFC6390].\n"
- title: 1.4.  Applicability
  contents:
  - "1.4.  Applicability\n   These metrics are applicable to any type of RTP application\
    \ that uses\n   the MPEG2 TS standard format for multimedia data, for example,\
    \ MPEG4\n   over MPEG2 TS over RTP.  This new block type can be useful for\n \
    \  measuring content stream or TS quality by checking TS header\n   information\
    \ [ETSI] and identifying the existence (and characterizing\n   the severity) of\
    \ bitstream packetization problems that may affect\n   users' perception of a\
    \ service delivered over RTP.  It may also be\n   useful for verifying the continued\
    \ correct operation of an existing\n   system management tool.\n"

  contents:
  - "3.  MPEG2 TS PSI Decodability Statistics Metrics Block\n   ETSI TR 101 290 [ETSI]\
    \ generally defines indicators related to error\n   events whereas the XR block\
    \ defined in this document contains counts\n   of occurrences of the [ETSI] indicators.\
    \  The block defined in this\n   document reports MPEG2 TS PSI decodability statistics\
    \ metrics beyond\n   the information carried in the standard RTCP packet format\
    \ and PSI-\n   Independent Decodability Statistics Metrics Block [RFC6990], which\n\
    \   are measured at the receiving end of the RTP stream.  It contains\n   counts\
    \ of seven metrics defined in ETSI TR 101 290 [ETSI].\n   Information is reported\
    \ about basic monitoring parameters necessary\n   to ensure that the TS can be\
    \ decoded, including:\n   o  Program Association Table (PAT) errors\n   o  PAT2\
    \ errors\n   o  Program Map Table (PMT) errors\n   o  PMT2 errors\n   o  Packet\
    \ Identifier (PID) errors\n   Information is also reported about continuous monitoring\
    \ parameters\n   necessary to ensure continuous decoding, including:\n   o  Cyclic\
    \ Redundancy Check (CRC) errors\n   o  Conditional Access Table (CAT) errors\n\
    \   In these parameters, PAT2 errors and PMT2 errors are actually\n   replacements\
    \ for and improvements on PAT errors and PMT errors,\n   respectively, and are\
    \ therefore preferred in future implementations.\n   In addition, measurement\
    \ results for some of these parameters (e.g.,\n   PAT errors or PMT errors) may\
    \ be different based on whether\n   scrambling is employed.  The other parameters\
    \ defined in Section 5 of\n   [ETSI] are ignored since they do not apply to all\
    \ MPEG2\n   implementations.  For further detailed information on these\n   parameters,\
