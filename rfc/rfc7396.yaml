  - "1.  Introduction\n   This specification defines the JSON merge patch document
    format,\n   processing rules, and associated MIME media type identifier.  The\n
    \  merge patch format is primarily intended for use with the HTTP PATCH\n   method
    [RFC5789] as a means of describing a set of modifications to a\n   target resource's
    content.\n   A JSON merge patch document describes changes to be made to a target\n
    \  JSON document using a syntax that closely mimics the document being\n   modified.
    \ Recipients of a merge patch document determine the exact\n   set of changes
    being requested by comparing the content of the\n   provided patch against the
    current content of the target document.\n   If the provided merge patch contains
    members that do not appear\n   within the target, those members are added.  If
    the target does\n   contain the member, the value is replaced.  Null values in
    the merge\n   patch are given special meaning to indicate the removal of existing\n
    \  values in the target.\n   For example, given the following original JSON document:\n
    \  {\n     \"a\": \"b\",\n     \"c\": {\n       \"d\": \"e\",\n       \"f\": \"g\"\n
    \    }\n   }\n   Changing the value of \"a\" and removing \"f\" can be achieved
    by\n   sending:\n   PATCH /target HTTP/1.1\n   Host: example.org\n   Content-Type:
    application/merge-patch+json\n   {\n     \"a\":\"z\",\n     \"c\": {\n       \"f\":
    null\n     }\n   }\n   When applied to the target resource, the value of the \"a\"
    member is\n   replaced with \"z\" and \"f\" is removed, leaving the remaining
    content\n   untouched.\n   This design means that merge patch documents are suitable
    for\n   describing modifications to JSON documents that primarily use objects\n
    \  for their structure and do not make use of explicit null values.  The\n   merge
    patch format is not appropriate for all JSON syntaxes.\n"

  - "2.  Processing Merge Patch Documents\n   JSON merge patch documents describe,
    by example, a set of changes\n   that are to be made to a target resource.  Recipients
    of merge patch\n   documents are responsible for comparing the merge patch with
    the\n   current content of the target resource to determine the specific set\n
    \  of change operations to be applied to the target.\n   To apply the merge patch
    document to a target resource, the system\n   realizes the effect of the following
    function, described in\n   pseudocode.  For this description, the function is
    called MergePatch,\n   and it takes two arguments: the target resource document
    and the\n   merge patch document.  The Target argument can be any JSON value or\n
    \  undefined.  The Patch argument can be any JSON value.\n   define MergePatch(Target,
    Patch):\n     if Patch is an Object:\n       if Target is not an Object:\n         Target
    = {} # Ignore the contents and set it to an empty Object\n       for each Name/Value
    pair in Patch:\n         if Value is null:\n           if Name exists in Target:\n
    \            remove the Name/Value pair from Target\n         else:\n           Target[Name]
    = MergePatch(Target[Name], Value)\n       return Target\n     else:\n       return
    Patch\n   There are a few things to note about the function.  If the patch is\n
    \  anything other than an object, the result will always be to replace\n   the
    entire target with the entire patch.  Also, it is not possible to\n   patch part
    of a target that is not an object, such as to replace just\n   some of the values
    in an array.\n   The MergePatch operation is defined to operate at the level of
    data\n   items, not at the level of textual representation.  There is no\n   expectation
    that the MergePatch operation will preserve features at\n   the textual-representation
    level such as white space, member\n   ordering, number precision beyond what is
    available in the target's\n   implementation, and so forth.  In addition, even
    if the target\n   implementation allows multiple name/value pairs with the same
    name,\n   the result of the MergePatch operation on such objects is not\n   defined.\n"

    \"Goodbye!\",\n     \"author\" : {\n       \"givenName\" : \"John\",\n       \"familyName\"
    : \"Doe\"\n     },\n     \"tags\":[ \"example\", \"sample\" ],\n     \"content\":
    \"This will be unchanged\"\n   }\n   A user agent wishing to change the value
    of the \"title\" member from\n   \"Goodbye!\" to the value \"Hello!\", add a new
    \"phoneNumber\" member,\n   remove the \"familyName\" member from the \"author\"
    object, and replace\n   the \"tags\" array so that it doesn't include the word
    \"sample\" would\n   send the following request:\n   PATCH /my/resource HTTP/1.1\n
    \  Host: example.org\n   Content-Type: application/merge-patch+json\n   {\n     \"title\":
    \"Hello!\",\n     \"phoneNumber\": \"+01-123-456-7890\",\n     \"author\": {\n
    \      \"familyName\": null\n     },\n     \"tags\": [ \"example\" ]\n   }\n   The
    resulting JSON document would be:\n   {\n     \"title\": \"Hello!\",\n     \"author\"
    : {\n       \"givenName\" : \"John\"\n     },\n     \"tags\": [ \"example\" ],\n
    \    \"content\": \"This will be unchanged\",\n     \"phoneNumber\": \"+01-123-456-7890\"\n

  - "5.  Security Considerations\n   The \"application/merge-patch+json\" media type
    allows user agents to\n   indicate their intention for the server to determine
    the specific set\n   of change operations to be applied to a target resource.
    \ As such, it\n   is the server's responsibility to determine the appropriateness
    of\n   any given change as well as the user agent's authorization to request\n
    \  such changes.  How such determinations are made is considered out of\n   the
    scope of this specification.\n   All of the security considerations discussed
    in Section 5 of\n   [RFC5789] apply to all uses of the HTTP PATCH method with
    the\n   \"application/merge-patch+json\" media type.\n"
