  - "1.   Introduction\n   ITU-T Recommendations H.323 [3] and H.225.0 [4] define\
    \ a system for\n   multimedia communications services over packet based networks.\n\
    \   H.225.0 [4] defines an alias type for carrying any standard Uniform\n   Resource\
    \ Locator (URL).  H.323 version 4 [3] introduced an H.323-\n   specific URL, which\
    \ may be used to resolve the address of a network\n   entity to which H.323 calls\
    \ may be directed.\n   This document reproduces the H323-URL definition found\
    \ in ITU-T\n   recommendation H.323 [3] and is published as an RFC for ease of\n\

  contents:
  - "2.   URL Scheme Formal Syntax Definition and Character Encoding\n   The H.323\

    \ ]\n   address     =   user / \"@\" hostport / user \"@\" hostport\n   user \
    \       =   1*(%x21-24 / %x26-3F / %x41-7F / escaped)\n                      \
    \  ; The symbols \"%\", \"@\", and symbols with\n                        ; a character\

    \ then escaped as necessary.  In the \"user\" field, the characters\n   with a\
    \ numeric value below 0x80 are case insensitive and the\n   characters with a\
    \ numeric value above or equal to 0x80 are case\n   sensitive.\n   The character\
    \ set and case sensitivity of the \"url-parameter\" is\n   specified in each parameter\
    \ definition.\n"
- title: 3.   Intended Usage
  contents:
  - "3.   Intended Usage\n   The H.323 URL is intended to help an entity resolve the\
    \ address of\n   another H.323 entity, where an \"entity\" may be a user, a device,\
    \ or a\n   service.  The \"user\" portion of the URL specifies an alias for the\n\
    \   entity, without carrying any information about the location of the\n   entity.\
    \  The \"hostport\", on the other hand, is the domain name of an\n   Endpoint,\
    \ Gatekeeper, Border Element, or other functional element to\n   which H.323 calls\
    \ may be directed or for which services may be\n   performed.\n"
- title: 4.   Applications and/or protocols, which may use H.323 URL scheme
  contents:
  - "4.   Applications and/or protocols, which may use H.323 URL scheme\n   H.323\
    \ URLs may be carried by other protocols, such as SIP [6] or TRIP\n   [9].  H.323\
    \ URLs may be also contained within web pages or within XML\n   data, which may\
    \ be utilized by H.323 entities in order to initiate\n   calls or perform services.\n"
- title: 5.   Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "5.   Security Considerations\n   When an H.323 URL is carried within H.225.0\
    \ [4] messages, security is\n   addressed by the H.235 security framework [5].\
    \  When an H.323 URL\n   carried within other protocols (such as SIP [6]), the\
    \ security is\n   addressed within the corresponding protocol.\n   In general,\
    \ security, as it relates to the usage and carriage of the\n   H.323 URLs, is\
    \ considered as an issue that should be addressed within\n   scope of H.323 or\
    \ other relevant protocols and is not within the\n   scope of this document.\n"
- title: 6.   IANA Considerations
  contents:
  - "6.   IANA Considerations\n   The purpose of this document is serving as a reference\
    \ point for the\n   purposes of registering the H.323 URL scheme with IANA.\n\
    \   Having the URL registered with IANA will ensure that there is no\n   duplication\
    \ of the URL scheme \"h323\".  This document reproduces the\n   exact H323-URL\
    \ definition as published in ITU-T Recommendation H.323\n   [3].\n   Registration\
