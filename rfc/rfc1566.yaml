  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information\
    \ Base (MIB)\n   for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.\n\
    \   In particular, this memo extends the basic Network Services\n   Monitoring\
    \ MIB [5] to allow monitoring of Message Transfer Agents\n   (MTAs). It may also\
    \ be used to monitor MTA components within\n   gateways.\n"
- title: 2.  The SNMPv2 Network Management Framework
  contents:
  - "2.  The SNMPv2 Network Management Framework\n   The SNMPv2 Network Management\
    \ Framework consists of four major\n   components.  They are:\n      o  RFC 1442\
    \ [1] which defines the SMI, the mechanisms used for\n         describing and\
    \ naming objects for the purpose of management.\n      o  STD 17, RFC 1213 [2]\
    \ defines MIB-II, the core set of managed\n         objects for the Internet suite\
    \ of protocols.\n      o  RFC 1445 [3] which defines the administrative and other\n\
    \         architectural aspects of the framework.\n      o  RFC 1448 [4] which\
    \ defines the protocol used for network\n         access to managed objects.\n\
    \   The Framework permits new objects to be defined for the purpose of\n   experimentation\
    \ and evaluation.\n"
- title: 2.1  Object Definitions
  contents:
  - "2.1  Object Definitions\n   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information\
    \ store, termed\n   the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB\
    \ are\n   defined using the subset of Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1)\n \
    \  defined in the SMI.  In particular, each object type is named by an\n   OBJECT\
    \ IDENTIFIER, an administratively assigned name.  The object\n   type together\
    \ with an object instance serves to uniquely identify a\n   specific instantiation\
    \ of the object.  For human convenience, we\n   often use a textual string, termed\
    \ the descriptor, to refer to the\n   object type.\n"
- title: 3.  Message Flow Model
  contents:
  - "3.  Message Flow Model\n   A general model of message flow inside an MTA has\
    \ to be presented\n   before a MIB can be described. Generally speaking, message\
    \ flow\n   occurs in four steps:\n   (1)  Messages are received by the MTA from\
    \ User Agents, Message\n        Stores, other MTAs, and gateways.\n   (2)  The\
    \ \"next hop\" for the each message is determined. This is\n        simply the\
    \ destination the message is to be transmitted to;\n        it may or may not\
    \ be the final destination of the message.\n        Multiple \"next hops\" may\
    \ exist for a single message (as a\n        result of either having multiple recipients\
    \ or distribution\n        list expansion); this may make it necessary to duplicate\n\
    \        messages.\n   (3)  Messages are converted into the format that's appropriate\n\
    \        for the next hop.\n   (4)  Messages are transmitted to the appropriate\
    \ destination,\n        which may be a User Agent, Message Store, another MTA,\
    \ or\n        gateway.\n   Storage of messages in the MTA occurs at some point\
    \ during this\n   process. However, it is important to note that storage may occur\
    \ at\n   different and possibly even multiple points during this process. For\n\
    \   example, some MTAs expand messages into multiple copies as they are\n   received.\
    \ In this case (1), (2), and (3) may all occur prior to\n   storage.  Other MTAs\
    \ store messages precisely as they are received\n   and perform all expansions\
    \ and conversions during retransmission\n   processing. So here only (1) occurs\
    \ prior to storage.  This leads to\n   situations where, in general, a measurement\
    \ of messages received may\n   not equal a measurement of messages in store, or\
    \ a measurement of\n   messages stored may not equal a measurement of messages\n\
    \   retransmitted, or both.\n"
- title: 4.  MTA Objects
  contents:
  - "4.  MTA Objects\n   If there are one or more MTAs on the host, the following\
    \ mta group\n   may be used to monitor them. Any number of the MTAs on a host\
    \ may be\n   monitored. Each MTA is dealt with as a separate application and has\n\
    \   its own applTable entry in the Network Services Monitoring MIB.\n   The MIB\
    \ described in this document covers only the portion which is\n   specific to\
    \ the monitoring of MTAs. The network service related part\n   of the MIB is covered\
    \ in a separate document [5].\n"
