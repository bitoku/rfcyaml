  - "1.  Introduction\n   The Conference Event Package [RFC4575] defines means for\
    \ a SIP User\n   Agent (UA) to obtain information about the state of the conference,\n\
    \   the types of media that are being used, the number and state of\n   current\
    \ participants, additional sources of information (e.g., web\n   page), availability\
    \ of recordings, and more.\n   Details describing auxiliary services available\
    \ for a conference are\n   included within a <service-uris> child element of the\n\
    \   <conference-description> element.  Such details are presented as a\n   set\
    \ of <entry> child elements, each containing the URI allowing\n   access the corresponding\
    \ auxiliary service.  In addition to the URI,\n   entries can also contain a descriptive\
    \ <display-text> element and are\n   expected to have a <purpose> element that\
    \ specifies their nature as\n   illustrated in the following example:\n   <conference-description>\n\
    \   <subject>Agenda: This sprint's goals</subject>\n     <service-uris>\n    \
    \   <entry>\n         <uri>http://conference.example.com/dev-group/</uri>\n  \
    \       <purpose>web-page</purpose>\n       </entry>\n     </service-uris>\n \
    \  </conference-description>\n   In addition to the \"web-page\" purpose mentioned\
    \ above, [RFC4575] also\n   defines several other possible values in the \"URI\
    \ Purposes\" sub-\n   registry under the existing \"Session Initiation Protocol\
    \ (SIP)\n   Parameters\" registry.\n   This specification adds the \"grouptextchat\"\
    \ value to this \"URI\n   Purposes\" sub-registry.  The new value allows conference\
    \ mixers or\n   focus agents to advertise a multi-user chat location (i.e., a\
    \ chat\n   room) associated with the current conference.\n   The actual URI carried\
    \ by the entry with the \"grouptextchat\" purpose\n   can be of any type as long\
    \ as the content that it points to allows\n   for instant text communication between\
    \ participants of the\n   conference.  Suitable URI schemes include sip: and sips:\
    \ [RFC3261]\n   for SIP-signaled Message Session Relay Protocol (MSRP) conferences,\n\
    \   xmpp: [RFC5122] for XMPP Multi-User Chat (MUC), irc: for Internet\n   Relay\
    \ Chat, http: or https: for web-based chat, and others.\n   The following example\
    \ shows one possible use case:\n   <conference-description>\n   <subject>Agenda:\
    \ The goals for this development sprint.</subject>\n     <service-uris>\n    \
    \   <entry>\n         <uri>xmpp:dev-sprint@conference.example.com</uri>\n    \
    \     <purpose>grouptextchat</purpose>\n       </entry>\n     </service-uris>\n\
    \   </conference-description>\n   It is worth pointing out that, in addition to\
    \ simply adding text\n   messaging capabilities to an audio/video conference,\
    \ group chats can\n   also be used for defining roles, giving permissions, muting,\
    \ kicking\n   out and banning participants, etc.  A conference mixer or focus\
    \ agent\n   can mimic these settings within the conference call, actually muting,\n\
    \   kicking out, or banning participants on the call as these actions\n   occur\
    \ in the chat room.  Such an approach requires no additional\n   specification\
    \ and is purely an implementation decision for the\n   conferencing software.\n\
    \   It is also worth mentioning that it is possible for the grouptextchat\n  \
    \ URI to match the URI of the conference.  This would typically be the\n   case\
    \ in scenarios where the conference focus agent also provides a\n   SIP-signaled\
    \ MSRP chat service at the same URI.\n   Also, in some cases, servers could potentially\
    \ advertise more than a\n   single chat room for a specific conference.  When\
    \ this happens,\n   clients supporting the \"grouptextchat\" purpose could either\
    \ present\n   the user with a choice of joining individual chats or simply opening\n\
    \   all of them simultaneously.  Either way, there is to be no\n   expectation\
    \ about any content synchronization between chat rooms.  If\n   synchronization\
    \ exists, such behavior would be entirely\n   implementation specific.\n"
- title: 2.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "2.  Security Considerations\n   Advertising group text chats over SIP could provide\
    \ malicious\n   entities with the following attack vector: if a malicious entity\
    \ is\n   capable of intercepting and modifying conference package event\n   notifications,\
    \ it could trick participants into joining a third-party\n   chat room where the\
    \ attacker could eavesdrop on the conversation and\n   potentially even impersonate\
    \ some of the participants.\n   Similar attacks are already possible with the\
    \ \"participation\"\n   <conference-uris> defined in [RFC4575], which is why it\
    \ recommends \"a\n   strong means for authentication and conference information\n\
    \   protection\" as well as \"comprehensive authorization rules\".  Clients\n\
    \   can integrity protect and encrypt notification messages using end-to-\n  \
    \ end mechanisms such as S/MIME or hop-by-hop mechanisms such as TLS.\n   When\
    \ none of these are possible, clients need to clearly display the\n   address\
    \ of the destination chat room (before and after it has been\n   joined) so that\
    \ users can notice possible discrepancies.\n   As an example, let's consider a\
    \ situation in which an attacker tricks\n   participants into joining a conference\
    \ chat at\n   xmpp:attack@evil.example.com rather than the chat at\n   xmpp:dev-sprint@conference.example.com,\
    \ which was originally\n   advertised for this conference.  In the absence of\
    \ any SIP-layer\n   security, displaying the full URI of the target chat room\
    \ to the user\n   would be the only way of actually detecting the problem.\n \
    \  Obviously, relying on human-performed string comparison is a rather\n   meek\
    \ form of protection.  Therefore, client developers are encouraged\n   to implement\
    \ additional checks that would allow users to request via\n   configuration that\
    \ a target chat room satisfy some basic criteria,\n   such as:\n   o  target chat\
    \ rooms belong to the same domain as the conference\n      service that is advertising\
    \ them.\n   o  chat room names (user part of the chat room URI) match the name\
    \ of\n      the conference.\n   Once again, these conditions are only satisfied\
    \ if the corresponding\n   deployment conventions have been followed and they\
    \ cannot be\n   universally required by clients.  Therefore, they are suggested\n\
    \   configuration options.\n   An additional security consideration might be the\
    \ possibility for\n   using a large-scale conference as leverage to perform a\
    \ flooding\n   attack on a chat room.  To help prevent this, clients could to\n\
    \   require an explicit user action before joining chat rooms on behalf\n   of\
    \ users.  In cases where such a constraint could be considered to\n   have a negative\
    \ impact on usability and where automatic joins are\n   seen as important, clients\
    \ may still perform the joins but only when\n   they can confirm a relationship\
    \ between the room and the conference\n   (e.g., they both belong to the same\
    \ administrative domain, or domains\n   that the client is provisioned to consider\
    \ as related).\n   Furthermore, an attack on an auxiliary chat room might be easier\
    \ (or\n   harder) than an attack on the main conference chat room depending on\n\
    \   the security policies in effect.  Once again, clients would have to\n   make\
    \ sure that users are appropriately notified about the security\n   levels of\
    \ each component of the conference and that user-specified\n   privacy restrictions\
    \ are applied to all of them.\n"
