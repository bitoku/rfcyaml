    \  document, \"IPv6 over Non Broadcast Multiple Access (NBMA) networks\".\n   It
    provides specific details on how to apply the IPv6 over NBMA\n   architecture
    to ATM networks. This architecture allows conventional\n   host-side operation
    of the IPv6 Neighbor Discovery protocol, while\n   also supporting the establishment
    of 'shortcut' ATM forwarding paths\n   (when using SVCs).  Operation over administratively

  - "3. PVC Environments\n   When the ATM network is used in PVC mode, each PVC will
    connect\n   exactly two nodes and the use of Neighbor Discovery and other IPv6\n
    \  features is limited.  IPv6/ATM interfaces have only one neighbor on\n   each
    Link. The MARS and NHRP protocols are NOT necessary, since\n   multicast and broadcast
    operations collapse down to an ATM level\n   unicast operation. Dynamically discovered
    shortcuts are not\n   supported.\n   The actual details of encapsulations, MTU,
    and link token generation\n   are provided in the following sections.\n   This
    use of PVC links does not mandate, nor does it prohibit the use\n   of extensions
    to the Neighbor Discovery protocol which may be\n   developed for either general
    use of for use in PVC connections (for\n   example, Inverse Neighbor Discovery).\n
    \  Since ATM PVC links do not use link-layer addresses, the link-layer\n   address
    options SHOULD not be included in any ND message [11].  If a\n   link-layer address
    option is present in an ND message, then the\n   option SHOULD be ignored.\n   A
    minimally conforming IPv6/ATM driver SHALL support the PVC mode of\n   operation.
