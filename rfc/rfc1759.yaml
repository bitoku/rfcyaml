  - "1.1.  Network Printing Environment\n   The management of producing a printed\
    \ document, in any computer\n   environment, is a complex subject. Basically,\
    \ the task can be divided\n   into two overlapping pieces, the management of printing\
    \ and the\n   management of the printer. Printing encompasses the entire process\
    \ of\n   producing a printed document from generation of the file to be\n   printed,\
    \ selection of a printer, choosing printing properties,\n   routing, queuing,\
    \ resource management, scheduling, and final printing\n   including notifying\
    \ the user.  Most of the printing process is outside\n   the scope of the model\
    \ presented here; only the management of the\n   printer is covered.\n       \

- title: 1.2.  Printer Device Overview
  contents:
  - "1.2.  Printer Device Overview\n   A printer is the physical device that takes\
    \ media from an input\n   source, produces marks on that media according to some\
    \ page\n   description or page control language and puts the result in some\n\
    \   output destination, possibly with finishing applied. Printers are\n   complex\
    \ devices that consume supplies, produce waste and have\n   mechanical problems.\
    \ In the management of the physical printing\n   device the description, status\
    \ and alert information concerning the\n   printer and its various subparts has\
    \ to be made available to the\n   management application so that it can be reported\
    \ to the end user,\n   key operators for the replenishment of supplies or the\
    \ repair or\n   maintenance of the device. The information needed in the management\n\
    \   of the physical printer and the management of a printing job overlap\n   highly\
    \ and many of the tasks in each management area require the same\n   or similar\
    \ information.\n"
- title: 1.3.  Categories of Printer Information
  contents:
  - "1.3.  Categories of Printer Information\n   Information about printers is classified\
    \ into three basic categories,\n   descriptions, status and alerts.\n"
- title: 1.3.1.  Descriptions
  contents:
  - "1.3.1.  Descriptions\n   Descriptions convey information about the configuration\
    \ and\n   capabilities of the printer and its various sub-units. This\n   information\
    \ is largely static information and does not generally\n   change during the operation\
    \ of the system but may change as the\n   printer is repaired, reconfigured or\
    \ upgraded. The descriptions are\n   one part of the visible state of the printer\
    \ where state means the\n   condition of being of the printer at any point in\
    \ time.\n"
- title: 1.3.2.  Status
  contents:
  - "1.3.2.  Status\n   Status is the information regarding the current operating\
    \ state of\n   the printer and its various sub-units. Status is the rest of the\n\
    \   visible state of the printer. As an example of the use of status, a\n   management\
    \ application must be able to determine if the various sub-\n   units are ready\
    \ to print or are in some state that prevents printing\n   or may prevent printing\
    \ in the future.\n"
- title: 1.3.3.  Alerts
  contents:
  - "1.3.3.  Alerts\n   An Alert is the representation of a reportable event in the\
    \ printer.\n   An event is a change in the state of the printer. Some of those\
    \ state\n   changes are of interest to a management application and are therefore\n\
    \   reportable. Typically, these are the events that affect the printer's\n  \
    \ ability to print. Alerts usually occur asynchronously to the\n   operation of\
    \ the computer system(s) to which the printer is attached.\n   For convenience\
    \ below, \"alert\" will be used for both the event caused\n   by a change in the\
    \ printer's state and for the representation of that\n   event.\n   Alerts can\
    \ be classified into two basic categories, critical and\n   non-critical.  A critical\
    \ alert is one that is triggered by entry\n   into a state in which the printer\
    \ is stopped and printing can not\n   continue until the condition that caused\
    \ critical alert is\n   eliminated. \"Out of paper\", \"toner empty\" and \"output\
    \ bin full\" are\n   examples of critical alerts. Non-critical alerts are triggered\
    \ by\n   those events that enter a state in which printing is not stopped.\n \
    \  Such a non-critical state may, at some future time, lead to a state\n   in\
    \ which printing may be stopped.  Examples of this kind of non-\n   critical alerts\
    \ are \"input media low\", \"toner low\" and \"output bin\n   nearly full\". Or,\
    \ a non-critical alert may simply provide\n   information, such as signaling a\
    \ configuration changed in the\n   printer.\n   Description, status and alert\
    \ information about printer can be\n   thought of as a data base describing the\
    \ printer. The management\n   application for a printer will want to view the\
    \ printer data base\n   differently depending on how and for what purposes the\
    \ information in\n   the data base is needed.\n"
- title: 2.  Printer Model
  contents:
  - "2.  Printer Model\n   In order to accomplish the management of the printer, an\
    \ abstract\n   model of the printer is needed to represent the sub-units from\
    \ which\n   the printer is composed. A printer can be described as consisting\
    \ of\n   13 types of sub-units. It is important to note that the sub-units of\n\
    \   a printer do not necessarily relate directly to any physically\n   identifiable\
    \ mechanism. Sub-units can also be a set of definable\n   logical processes, such\
    \ as interpreters for page description\n   languages or command processors that\
    \ set various operating modes of\n   the printer.\n   Figure 2 shows a block diagram\
    \ of the printer and its basic 13 sub-\n   units.\n                     Figure\

- title: 2.1.  Overview of the Printer Model
  contents:
  - "2.1.  Overview of the Printer Model\n   The model has three basic parts: (1)\
    \ the flow of a print file into an\n   interpreter and onto the marker, (2) the\
    \ flow of media through the\n   marker and (3) the auxiliary sub-units that control\
    \ and facilitate\n   the two prior flows.  The flow of the print data comes through\
    \ a\n   physical connection on which some form of transport protocol stack is\n\
    \   running.  The data provided by the transport protocol (interface)\n   appears\
    \ on a channel which is the input to an interpreter. The\n   interpreter converts\
    \ the print data into a form suitable for marking\n   on the media.\n   The media\
    \ resides in Input sub-units from which the media is selected\n   and then transported\
    \ via a Media Path first to a Marking sub-unit and\n   then onto an Output sub-unit\
    \ with (optionally) some finishing\n   operations being performed.  The auxiliary\
    \ sub-units facilitate\n   control of the printer, inquiry/control of the operator\
    \ panel,\n   reporting of alerts, and the adaptation of the printer to various\n\
    \   natural languages and characters sets. All the software sub-units run\n  \
    \ on the System Controller which represents the processor, memory and\n   storage\
    \ systems of the Printer.  Each of the sub-units is discussed\n   in more detail\
    \ below.\n   All of the sub-units other than the Alerts report only state\n  \
    \ information, either a description or a status. The Alerts sub-unit\n   reports\
    \ event information.\n"
- title: 2.2.  Printer Sub-Units
  contents:
  - "2.2.  Printer Sub-Units\n   A printer is composed of 13 types of sub-units, called\
    \ groups.  The\n   following sections describe the different types of sub-units.\n"
- title: 2.2.1.  General Printer
  contents:
  - "2.2.1.  General Printer\n   The general printer sub-unit is responsible for the\
    \ overall control\n   and status of the printer. There is exactly one general\
    \ printer sub-\n   unit in a printer. The general printer sub-unit is represented\
    \ by the\n   General Printer Group in the model. In addition to the providing\
    \ the\n   status of the whole printer and allowing the printer to be reset,\n\
    \   this Group provides information on the status of the packaging of the\n  \
    \ printer, in particular, the covers. The general printer sub-unit is\n   usually\
    \ implemented on the system controller.\n   The localization portion of the general\
    \ printer sub-unit is\n   responsible for identifying the natural language, country,\
    \ and\n   character set in which character strings are expressed. There may be\n\
    \   one or more localizations supported per printer. The available\n   localizations\
    \ are represented by the Localization table.\n   Localization is only performed\
    \ on those strings in the MIB that are\n   explicitely marked as being localized.\
    \  All other character strings\n   are returned in ASCII.\n   The character set\
    \ portion of the general printer sub-unit is\n   responsible for identifying the\
    \ possible character sets that are used\n   by the interpreters, the operator\
    \ console, and in network management\n   requests for display objects. There may\
    \ be one or more character sets\n   per printer.  The understood character sets\
    \ are represented by the\n   Character Set Table.\n"
- title: 2.2.2.  Inputs
  contents:
  - "2.2.2.  Inputs\n   Input sub-units are mechanisms that feed media to be marked\
    \ on into\n   the printer. A printer contains one or more input sub-units. These\n\
    \   are represented by the Input Group in the model. The model does not\n   distinguish\
    \ fixed input bins from removable trays, except to report\n   when a removable\
    \ tray has been removed.\n   There are as many input sub-units as there are distinctly\
    \ selectable\n   input \"addresses\".  For example, if a tray has an option for\
    \ manually\n   feeding paper as well as automatically feeding from the tray, then\n\
    \   this is two input sub-units if these two sources can be (must be)\n   separately\
    \ selected and is one input sub-unit if putting a sheet in\n   the manual feed\
    \ slot overrides feeding from the contents of the tray;\n   that is, in the second\
    \ case there is no way to separately select or\n   address the manual feed slot.\n"
- title: 2.2.3.  Media
  contents:
  - "2.2.3.  Media\n   An input sub-unit can hold one or more instances of the media\
    \ on\n   which marking is to be done. Typically, there is a large set of\n   possible\
    \ media that can be associated with an input. The Media Group\n   is an extension\
    \ of the Input Group which represents that media that\n   is in an input sub-unit.\
    \ The Media Group only describes the current\n   contents of each input and not\
    \ the possible content of the input\n   sub-unit.\n"
- title: 2.2.4.  Outputs
  contents:
  - "2.2.4.  Outputs\n   Output sub-units are mechanisms that receive media that has\
    \ been\n   marked on. A printer contains one or more output mechanisms. These\n\
    \   are represented by the Output Group in the model. The model does not\n   distinguish\
    \ fixed output bins from removable output bins, except to\n   report when a removable\
    \ bin has been removed.\n   There are as many output sub-units as there are distinctly\
    \ selectable\n   output \"addresses\".  Output sub-units can be addressed in two\n\
    \   different ways: (1) as a set of \"mailboxes\" which are addressed by a\n \
    \  specific mailbox selector such as a bin number or a bin name, or (2)\n   as\
    \ a set of \"slots\" into which multiple copies are collated.\n   Sometimes both\
    \ modes of using the output sub-units can be used on the\n   same printer.  All\
    \ that is important from the viewpoint of the model\n   is that the output units\
    \ can be separately selected.\n"
- title: 2.2.5.  Finishers
  contents:
  - "2.2.5.  Finishers\n   A finisher is a sub-unit that performs some operations\
    \ on the media\n   other than marking.  The finisher sub-units are represented\
    \ by the\n   Finisher Group in the model.  Some examples of finishing processes\n\
    \   are stapling, punching, binding, inserting, or folding.  Finishing\n   processes\
    \ may have supplies asssociated with the process.  Stapling,\n   binding, and\
    \ punching are examples of processes that have supplies. A\n   printer may have\
    \ more than one finishing sub-unit and each finishing\n   sub-unit may be associated\
    \ with one or more output sub-units.\n   Finishers are not described in this MIB.\n\
    \   The exact interaction and sequencing between an output device and its\n  \
    \ associated finisher is not specified by the model. It depends on the\n   type\
    \ of finishing process and the exact implementation of the printer\n   system.\
    \ This standard allows for the logical association of a\n   finishing process\
    \ with an output device but does not put any\n   restrictions on the exact sequence\
    \ or interaction with the associated\n   output device. The output and finisher\
    \ sub-units may or may not be\n   separate identifiable physical mechanisms depending\
    \ on the exact\n   implementation of a printer.  In addition, a single output\
    \ device may\n   be associated with multiple finishing sub-units and a single\n\
    \   finishing sub-unit may be associated with multiple output devices.\n"
- title: 2.2.6.  Markers
  contents:
  - "2.2.6.  Markers\n   A marker is the mechanism that produces marks on the print\
    \ media. The\n   marker sub-units and their associated supplies are represented\
    \ by the\n   Marker Group in the model. A printer can contain one or more marking\n\
    \   mechanisms.  Some examples of multiple marker sub-units are: a\n   printer\
    \ with separate markers for normal and magnetic ink or an\n   imagesetter that\
    \ can output to both a proofing device and final film.\n   Each marking device\
    \ can have its own set of  characteristics\n   associated with it, such as marking\
    \ technology and resolution.\n   In this model the marker sub-unit is viewed as\
    \ very generalized and\n   encompasses all aspects of a marking process. For example,\
    \ in a\n   xero-graphic process, the marking process as well as the fusing\n \
    \  process would be included in the generalized concept of the marker.\n   With\
    \ the generalized concept of a marking process, the concept of\n   multiple marking\
    \ supplies associated with a single marking sub-unit\n   results. For example,\
    \ in the xerographic process, there is not only a\n   supply of toner, but there\
    \ can also be other supplies such as a fuser\n   supply that can be consumed and\
    \ replaced separately. In addition\n   there can be multiple supplies of toner\
    \ for a single marker device,\n   as in a color process.\n"
- title: 2.2.7.  Media Paths
  contents:
  - "2.2.7.  Media Paths\n   The media paths encompass the mechanisms in the printer\
    \ that move the\n   media through the printer and connect all other media related\
    \ sub-\n   units: inputs, outputs, markers and finishers. A printer contains one\n\
    \   or more media paths. These are represented by the Media Path Group in\n  \
    \ the model.  The Media Path group has some objects that apply to all\n   paths\
    \ plus a table of the separate media paths.\n   In general, the design of the\
    \ media paths determines the maximum\n   speed of the printer as well as the maximum\
    \ media size that the\n   printer can handle. Media paths are complex mechanisms\
    \ and can\n   contain many different identifiable sub-mechanisms such as media\n\
    \   movement devices, media buffers, duplexing units and interlocks. Not\n   all\
    \ of the various sub-mechanisms reside on every media path.  For\n   example,\
    \ one media path may provide printing only on one surface of\n   the media (a\
    \ simplex path) and another media path may have a sub-\n   mechanism that turns\
    \ the media over and feeds it a second time\n   through the marker sub-unit (a\
    \ duplex path).  The duplex path may\n   even have a buffer sub-mechanism that\
    \ allows multiple copies of the\n   obverse side to be held before the reverse\
    \ side of all the copies are\n   marked.\n"
- title: 2.2.8.  System Controller
  contents:
  - "2.2.8.  System Controller\n   The System Controller is the sub-unit upon which\
    \ the software\n   components of the Printer run. The System Controller is represented\n\
    \   in the model by the Host MIB. This MIB allows for the specification\n   of\
    \ the processor(s), memory, disk storage, file system and other\n   underlying\
    \ sub-mechanisms of the printer. The controller can range\n   from simple single\
    \ processor systems to multiprocessor systems. In\n   addition, controllers can\
    \ have a full range of resources such as hard\n   disks. The printer is modeled\
    \ to have one system controller even\n   though it may have more than one processor\
    \ and multiple other\n   resources associated with it.\n"
- title: 2.2.9.  Interfaces
  contents:
  - "2.2.9.  Interfaces\n   An interface is the communications port and associated\
    \ protocols that\n   are responsible for the transport of data to the printer.\
    \ A printer\n   has one or more interface sub-units. The interfaces are represented\n\
    \   by the Interfaces Group of MIB-II (RFC 1213). Some examples of\n   interfaces\
    \ are serial ports (with little or no protocol) and EtherNet\n   ports on which\
    \ one might run InterNet IP, Novell IPX, etc.\n"
- title: 2.2.10.  Channels
  contents:
  - "2.2.10.  Channels\n   The channel sub-units identify the independent sources\
    \ of print data\n   (here print data is the information that is used to construct\
    \ printed\n   pages and may have both data and control aspects).  A printer may\n\
    \   have one or more channels. The channel sub-units are represented by\n   the\
    \ Channel Group in the Model. Each channel is typically identified\n   by the\
    \ electronic path and service protocol used to deliver print\n   data to the printer.\
    \ A channel sub-unit may be independently enabled\n   (allowing print data to\
    \ flow) or disabled (stopping the flow of print\n   data). It has a current Control\
    \ Language which can be used to specify\n   which interpreter is to be used for\
    \ the print data and to query and\n   change environment variables used by the\
    \ interpreters (and SNMP).\n   There is also a default interpreter that is to\
    \ be used if an\n   interpreter is not explicitly specified using the Control\
    \ Language.\n   Channel sub-units are based on an underlying interface.\n"
- title: 2.2.11.  Interpreters
  contents:
  - "2.2.11.  Interpreters\n   The interpreter sub-units are responsible for the conversion\
    \ of a\n   description of intended print instances into images that are to be\n\
    \   marked on the media. A printer may have one or more interpreters. The\n  \
    \ interpreter sub-units are represented by the Interpreter Group in the\n   Model.\
    \ Each interpreter is generally implemented with software\n   running on the System\
    \ Controller sub-unit. The Interpreter Table has\n   one entry per interpreter\
    \ where the interpreters include both Page\n   Description Language (PDL) Interpreters\
    \ and Control Language\n   Interpreters.\n"
- title: 2.2.12.  Console
  contents:
  - "2.2.12.  Console\n   Many printers have a console on the printer, the operator\
    \ console,\n   that is used to display and modify the state of the printer.  The\n\
    \   console can be as simple as a few indicators and switches or as\n   complicated\
    \ as full screen displays and keyboards. There can be at\n   most one such console.\
    \  This console sub-unit is represented by the\n   Console Group in the model.\
    \  Although most of the information\n   displayed there is also available in the\
    \ state of the printer as\n   represented by the various Groups, it is useful\
    \ to be able to query\n   and modify the operator console remotely.  For example,\
    \ a management\n   application might like to display to its user the current message\
    \ on\n   the operator console of the remote printer or the management\n   application\
    \ user might like to modify the current message on the\n   operators console of\
    \ the remote printer.  As another example, one\n   might have a remote application\
    \ that puts up a pseudo console on a\n   workstation screen. Since the rules by\
    \ which the printer state is\n   mapped onto the console and vice versa are not\
    \ standardized, it is\n   not possible to reproduce the console state or the action\
    \ of console\n   buttons and menus. Therefore, the Console Group provides access\
    \ to\n   the console. The operator console is usually implemented on the\n   system\
    \ controller with additional hardware for input and display.\n"
- title: 2.2.13.  Alerts
  contents:
  - "2.2.13.  Alerts\n   The alert sub-unit is responsible for detecting reportable\
    \ events,\n   making an entry in the alert table and, if and only if the event\
    \ is a\n   critical event, initiating a trap. The alert sub-unit is represented\n\
    \   by the Alerts Group and, in particular, the Alert Table. This table\n   contains\
    \ information on the severity, sub-unit, detailed location\n   within the sub-unit,\
    \ alert code and description of each critical\n   alert that is currently active\
    \ within the printer. Each reportable\n   event causes an entry to be made in\
    \ the Alert Table.\n"
- title: 2.2.13.1.  Status and Alerts
  contents:
  - "2.2.13.1.  Status and Alerts\n   Summary information about the state of the printer\
    \ is reported at\n   three separate levels: (1) there is the status of the printer\
    \ as a\n   whole reported in the Host MIB, (2) there is the status of various\n\
    \   sub-units reported in the principle table of the Group that\n   represents\
    \ the sub-unit, and (3) there are alert codes reported in\n   the Alert Table.\n"
- title: 2.2.13.2.  Overall Printer Status
  contents:
  - "2.2.13.2.  Overall Printer Status\n   Of the many states a printer can be in,\
    \ certain states are more\n   \"interesting\" because of the distinct actions\
    \ they are likely to\n   provoke in the administrator.  These states may be applied\
    \ to the\n   printer as a whole, or to a particular sub-unit of the printer.\n\
    \   These named states are:\n   Non Critical Alert Active - For the printer this\
    \ means that one or\n   more sub-units have a non-critical alert active.  For\
    \ a sub-unit,\n   this means that the sub-unit has a non-critical alert active.\n\
    \   Critical Alert Active - For the printer this means that one or more\n   sub-units\
    \ have a critical alert active.  For a sub-unit, this means\n   that the sub-unit\
    \ has a critical alert active.\n   Unavailable - The printer or sub-unit is unavailable\
    \ for use (this is\n   the same as \"broken\" or \"down\" in other terminologies).\
    \  A trained\n   service person is typically necessary to make it available.\n\
    \   Busy / Temporarily Unavailable - The printer or sub-unit is\n   operational\
    \ but currently occupied with a request for activity. The\n   sub-unit will become\
    \ available without the need of human interaction.\n   Moving on-line or off-line\
    \ - The printer is either off-line, in the\n   process of moving off-line or in\
    \ the process of moving back on-line;\n   for example on high end printers reloading\
    \ paper involves a\n   transition to off-line to open the paper bin, it is then\
    \ filled and,\n   finally, there is a transition back to on-line as the paper\
    \ bin is\n   repositioned for printing.\n   Standby - The printer or sub-unit\
    \ is unavailable for use because it\n   is partially powered down and may need\
    \ some period of time to become\n   fully operational again.  A unit in Standby\
    \ state shall respond to\n   network management requests.\n   The Host MIB provides\
    \ three status objects that can be used to\n   describe the status of a printer:\
    \ (1) hrDeviceStatus in the entry in\n   the Host MIB hrDeviceTable; (2) hrPrinterStatus\
    \ in the\n   hrPrinterTable; and (3) hrPrinterDetectedErrorState in the\n   hrPrinterTable.\
    \  These objects describe many of the states that a\n   printer can be in.  The\
    \ following table shows how the \"interesting\"\n   states named above can be\
    \ recognized by inspecting the values of the\n   three printer-related objects\

- title: 2.2.13.3.  Alert Tables
  contents:
  - "2.2.13.3.  Alert Tables\n   The Alert Group consists of a single table in which\
    \ all active alerts\n   are represented.  This section provides and overview of\
    \ the table and\n   a description of how it is managed.  The basic content of\
    \ the alert\n   table is the severity (critical or non-critical) of the alert,\
    \ the\n   Group and entry where a state change caused the alert, additional\n\
    \   information about the alert (a more detailed location, an alert code,\n  \
    \ and a description), and an indication of the level of training needed\n   to\
    \ service the alert.\n   The Alert Table contains some information that is redundant,\
    \ for\n   example that an event has occurred, and some information that is only\n\
    \   represented in the Alert Table, for example the additional\n   information.\
    \  A single table was used because a single entry in a\n   Group could cause more\
    \ than one alert, for example paper jams in more\n   than one place in a media\
    \ path. Associating the additional\n   information with the entry in the affected\
    \ group would only allow one\n   report where associating the additional information\
    \ with the alert\n   makes multiple reports possible.\n   Every time an alert\
    \ occurs in the printer, the printer makes one or\n   more entries into the Alert\
    \ Table. The printer determines if an event\n   is to be classified as critical\
    \ or non-critical. If the severity of\n   the Alert is \"critical\", the printer\
    \ sends a trap or event\n   notification to the host indicating that the table\
    \ has changed.\n   Whether or not a trap is sent, the management application is\
    \ expected\n   to poll the printer on a regular basis and to read and parse the\n\
    \   table to determine what conditions have changed, in order to provide\n   reliable\
    \ information to the management application user.\n"
- title: 2.2.13.4.  Alert Table Management
  contents:
  - "2.2.13.4.  Alert Table Management\n   The alert tables are sparsely populated\
    \ tables. This means the tables\n   will only contain entries of the alerts that\
    \ are currently active and\n   the number of rows, or entries in the table will\
    \ be dynamic. More\n   than one event can be added or removed from the event tables\
    \ at a\n   time depending on the implementation of the printer.\n   There are\
    \ basically two kinds of events that produce alerts: binary\n   change events\
    \ and simple change events. Binary change events come in\n   pairs: the leading\
    \ edge event and the trailing edge event. The\n   leading edge event enters a\
    \ state from which there is only one exit;\n   for example, going from running\
    \ to stopped with a paper jam. The only\n   exit from this state is fixing the\
    \ paper jam and it is clear when\n   that is accomplished.  The trailing edge\
    \ event is the event which\n   exits the state the was entered by the leading\
    \ edge event; in the\n   example above fixing the paper jam is the trailing edge\
    \ event.\n   It is relatively straightforward to manage binary change events in\n\
    \   the Alert Table. Only the leading edge event makes an entry in the\n   alert\
    \ table.  This entry persists in the Alert Table until the\n   trailing edge event\
    \ occurs at which point this event is signal by the\n   removal of the leading\
    \ edge event entry in the Alert Table.  That is,\n   a trailing edge event does\
    \ not create an entry; it removes the\n   corresponding leading edge event. With\
    \ binary events it is possible\n   to compute the maximum number that can occur\
    \ at the same time and\n   construct an Alert Table that would hold that many\
    \ events. There\n   would be no possibility of table overflow and no information\
    \ about\n   outstanding events would be lost.\n   Unfortunately, there are some\
    \ events that are not binary changes.\n   This other category of event, the simple\
    \ change event,  is\n   illustrated by the configuration change event. With this\
    \ kind of\n   event the state of the machine has changed, but to a state which\
    \ is\n   (often) just as valid as the state that was left and from which no\n\
    \   return is necessary.  For example, an operator may change the paper\n   that\
    \ is in the primary input source from letter to legal. At some\n   time in the\
    \ future the paper may be changed back to letter, but it\n   might be changed\
    \ to executive instead.  This is where the problem\n   occurs. It is not obvious\
    \ how long to keep simple change event\n   entries in the Alert Table. It they\
    \ were never removed, the Alert\n   Table would continue to grow indefinitely.\n\
    \   The agent needs to have an algorithm implemented for the management\n   of\
    \ the alert table, especially in the face of combinations of binary\n   and simple\
    \ alerts that would overflow the storage capaciity of the\n   table.  When the\
    \ table is full and a new alert needs to be added, an\n   old alert needs to be\
    \ deleted.  The alert to be deleted should be\n   chosen using the following rules:\n\
    \    1. Find a non-critical simple alert and delete it.  If there are\n      \
    \ multiple non-critical simple alerts, it is suggested that the\n       oldest\
    \ one be chosen.  If there are no non-critical simple\n       alerts, then,\n\
    \    2. Find a non-critical binary alert and delete it.  If there are\n      \
    \ multiple non-critical binary alerts, it is suggested that the\n       oldest\
    \ one be chosen.  If there are no non-critical binary\n       alerts, then,\n\
    \    3. Find a critical (binary) alert and delete it.  If there are\n       multiple\
    \ critical alerts, it is suggested that the\n       oldest one be chosen.  Agent\
    \ implementors are encouraged to\n       provide at least enough storage space\
    \ for the maximum number\n       of critical alerts that could occur simultaneously.\
    \  Note that\n       all critical alerts are binary.\n   Note that because the\
    \ Alert Index is a monotonically increasing\n   integer there will be gaps in\
    \ the values in the table when an alert\n   is deleted.  Such gaps can be detected\
    \ by the management application\n   to indicate that the management application\
    \ may want to re-acquire\n   the Printer state and check for state changes it\
    \ did not observe in\n   the Alert Table.\n"
- title: 2.3.  Read-Write Objects
  contents:
  - "2.3.  Read-Write Objects\n   Some of the objects in the printer MIB report on\
    \ the existence of or\n   amount of a given resource used with the printer.  Some\
    \ examples of\n   such resources are the size and number of sheets of paper in\
    \ a paper\n   tray or the existence of certain output options.  On some printers\n\
    \   there are sensors that allow these resources to be sensed.  Other\n   printers,\
    \ however, lack sensors that can detect (all of) the\n   properties of the resource.\
    \  Because the printer needs to know of the\n   existence or properties of these\
    \ resources for the printer to\n   function properly some other way of providing\
    \ this information is\n   needed.  The chosen way to solve this problem is to\
    \ allow a\n   management application to write into objects which hold the\n  \
    \ descriptive or existence values for printers that cannot sense the\n   values.\
    \  Thus many of the objects in the MIB are given read-write\n   access, but a\
    \ printer implementation might only permit a management\n   operation to change\
    \ the value if the printer could not sense the\n   value itself.  Therefore, the\
    \ ability to change the value of a read-\n   write object may depend on the implementation\
    \ of the agent.  Note\n   that even though some objects explicitely state the\
    \ behaviour of\n   conditional ability to change values, any read-write object\
    \ may act\n   that way.\n   Generally, an object is given read-write access in\
    \ the Printer MIB\n   specification if:\n  1.The object involves installation\
    \ of a resource that some\n    printers cannot themselves detect.  Therefore,\
    \ external means are\n    needed to inform the printer of the installation.  (Here\
    \ external\n    means include using the operator console, or remote management\n\
    \    application) and\n  2.The printer will behave differently if the installation\
    \ of the\n    resource is reported than the printer would if the installation\n\
    \    were not reported; that is, the object is not to be used\n    as a place\
    \ to put information not used by the printer, i.e., not a\n    \"PostIt\".  Another\
    \ way of saying this is that the printer believes\n    that information given\
    \ it and acts as if the information were\n    true.  For example, on a printer\
    \ that cannot sense the size, if\n    one paper size is loaded, but another size\
    \ is set into the paper\n    size object, then the printer will use the size that\
    \ was\n    set as its current paper size in its imaging and paper handling.\n\
    \   The printer may get hints that it may not know about the existence or\n  \
    \ properties of certain resources.  For example, a paper tray may be\n   removed\
    \ and re-inserted.  When this removal and insertion happens,\n   the printer may\
    \ either assume that a property, such as the size of\n   paper in the tray, has\
    \ not changed or the printer may change the\n   value of the associated object\
    \ to \"unknown\", as might be done for the\n   amount of paper in the tray.  As\
    \ long as the printer acts according\n   to the value in  the object either strategy\
    \ is acceptable.\n   It is an implementation-specific matter as to whether or\
    \ not MIB\n   object values are persistent across power cycles or cold starts.\
    \  It\n   is particularly important that the values of the prtMarkerLifeCount\n\
    \   object persist throughout the lifetime of the printer.  Therefore, if\n  \
    \ the value of any MIB object persists across power cycles, then the\n   prtMarkerLifeCount\
    \ object must also persist.\n"

    \ value that specifies both a set of\n          characters that may be used and\
    \ an encoding (as one or more\n          octets) that is used to represent the\
    \ characters in the\n          set. These values are to be used to identify the\
    \ encoding\n          employed for strings in the MIB where this is not fixed\
    \ by\n          the MIB.\n          Some objects that allow a choice of coded\
    \ character set\n          are: the prtLocalizationCharacterSet object in the\n\
    \          LocalizationTable and prtInterpreterDefaultCharSetIn.\n          The\
    \ prtGeneralCurrentLocalization and prtConsoleLocalization\n          objects\
    \ in turn contain the index in the LocalizationTable\n          of the current\
    \ localization (country, language, and coded\n          character set) of the\
    \ `description' objects and the console,\n          respectively.\n          The\
    \ space of the coded character set enumeration has been\n          divide into\
    \ three regions. The first region (3-999) consists\n          of coded character\
    \ sets that have been standardized by some\n          standard setting organization.\
    \ This region is intended for\n          standards that do not have subset implementations.\
    \ The\n          second region (1000-1999) is for the Unicode and ISO/IEC 10646\n\
    \          coded character sets together with a specification of a (set\n    \
    \      of) sub-repetoires that may occur.  The third region (>1999)\n        \
    \  is intended for vendor specific coded character sets.\n          NOTE: Unicode\
    \ and ISO 10646 character coded data may be\n          processed and stored in\
    \ either Big Endian (most significant\n          octet first) or Little Endian\
    \ (least significant octet\n          first) order.  Intel x86, VAX, and Alpha/AXP\
    \ architectures are\n          examples of Little Endian processor architectures.\n\
    \          Furthermore, in environments where either order may occur,\n      \
    \    so-called Unicode BYTE ORDER MARK (BOM) character (which is\n          ISO\
    \ 10646 ZERO WIDTH NO BREAK SPACE), coded as FEFF in two\n          octets and\
    \ 0000FEFF in four octets is used at the beginning\n          of the data as a\
    \ signature to indicate the order of the\n          following data (See ISO 10646\
    \ Annex F).  Thus either\n          ordering and BOM may occur in print data streams\
    \ sent to the\n          interpreter.  However, ISO 8824/8825 (ASN.1/BER) used\
    \ by\n          SNMP is quite clear that Big Endian order shall be used and\n\
    \          BOM shall NOT be used in transmission in the protocol.\n          Transmitting\
    \ Unicode in Big Endian order in SNMP should\n          not prove to be a hardship\
    \ for Little Endian machines,\n          since SNMP ASN.1/BER requires integers\
    \ to be transmitted\n          in Big Endian order as well.  So SNMP implementations\
    \ on\n          Little Endian machines are already reversing the order of\n  \
    \        integers to make them Big Endian for transmission via\n          SNMP.\
    \  Also Unicode characters are usually treated as\n          two-octet integers,\
    \ not short text strings, so that it will\n          be straightforward for Little\
    \ Endian machines to reverse the\n          order of Unicode character octets\
    \ as well before\n          transmitting them and after receiving them via the\
    \ SNMP\n          protocol.\n          Where a given coded character set may be\
    \ known by more than\n          one name, the most commonly known name is used\
    \ as the name\n          of the enumeration and other names are shown in the\n\
    \          comments.  The comments also indicate where to find detailed\n    \
    \      information on the coded character set and briefly\n          characterize\
    \ its relationship to other similar coded\n          character sets.\n       \
    \   The current list of character sets and their enumerated\n          values\
    \ used to reference them is contained in the IANA\n          Character Set registry.\
    \  The enum value is indicated by\n          the MIBenum entry in the registry.\
    \  The enum symbol is\n          indicated by the Alias that starts with `cs'\
    \ for character\n          set.\n          The IANA character sets registry is\
    \ available via\n          anonymous ftp.\n          The ftp server is ftp.isi.edu.\n\
    \          The subdirectory is /in-notes/iana/assignments/.\n          The file\
    \ name is character-sets.\n          To add a character set to the IANA Registry:\n\
    \             1. Format an entry like those in the current list,\n           \
    \     omitting the MIBenum value.\n             2. Send the entry with a request\
    \ to add the entry\n                to the character set list to iana@ISI.EDU.\n\
    \             3. The IANA will supply a unique MIBenum value\n               \
    \ and update the list.\"\n      -- This is a type 3 enumeration.\n      SYNTAX\

    The level of training required to handle this alert. The\n        training level\
    \ is an enumeration that is determined and\n        assigned by the printer manufacturer\
    \ based on the information\n        or the training required to handle this alert.\
    \  The printer\n        will break alerts into these different training levels.\
    \  It is\n        the responsibility of the management application in the system\n\
    \        to determine how a particular alert is handled and how and to\n     \
    \   whom that alert is routed.  The following are the four\n        training levels\
    \ of alerts:\n               Field Service - Alerts that typically require advanced\n\
    \                      training and technical knowledge of the printer\n     \
    \                 and its sub-units. An example of a technical\n             \
    \         person would be a manufacture's Field Service\n                    \
    \  representative, or other person formally\n                      trained by\
    \ the manufacturer or similar\n                      representative.\n       \
    \        Trained - Alerts that require an intermediate or moderate\n         \
    \             level of knowledge of the printer and its\n                    \
    \  sub-units. A typical examples of alerts that\n                      a trained\
    \ operator can handle is replacing\n                      toner cartridges.\n\
    \               Untrained - Alerts that can be fixed without prior\n         \
    \             training either because the action to correct\n                \
    \      the alert is obvious or the printer can help the\n                    \
    \  untrained person fix the problem. A typical\n                      example\
    \ of such an alert is reloading paper\n                      trays and emptying\
    \ output bins on a low end\n                      printer.\n               Management\

  - "Appendix A - Glossary of Terms\n   Addressability -- on the marker, the number\
    \ of distinctly setable\n   marking units (pels) per unit of addressability unit;\
    \ for example,\n   300 dots per inch is expressed as 300 per 1000 Thousandths\
    \ Of Inches\n   and 4 dots per millimeter is 4 per 1000 Micrometers. Addressability\n\
    \   is not resolution because marks that are one addressability position\n   apart\
    \ may not be independently resolvable by the eye due to factors\n   such as gain\
    \ in the area of marks so they overlap or nearly touch.\n   Alert -- a reportable\
    \ event for which there is an entry in the alert\n   table\n   Bin -- an output\
    \ sub-unit which may or may not be removable\n   Bursting -- the process by which\
    \ continuous media is separated into\n   individual sheets, typically by bursting\
    \ along pre-formed\n   perforations.\n   Channel -- A term used to describe a\
    \ single source of data which is\n   presented to a printer.  The model that we\
    \ use in describing a\n   printer allows for an arbitrary number of channels.\
    \  Multiple\n   channels can exist on the same physical port.  This is commonly\
    \ done\n   over EtherNet ports where EtherTalk, TCP/IP, and SPX/IPX protocols\n\
    \   can be supplying different data streams simultaneously to a single\n   printer\
    \ on the same physical port.\n   Collation -- in multiple copy output, placing\
    \ the pages from separate\n   copies into separte output bins\n   Control Language\
    \ - a data syntax or language for controlling the\n   printer through the print\
    \ data channel.\n   Critical Alert -- an alert triggered by an event which leads\
    \ to a\n   state in which printing is no longer possible; the printer is stopped\n\
    \   Decollating -- the process by which the individual parts within a\n   multi-part\
    \ form are separated and sorted into separate stacks for\n   each part.\n   Description\
    \ -- information about the configuration and capabilities\n   of the printer and\
    \ its various sub-units\n   DPA - ISO 10175 Document Printing Application standard.\
    \  A standard\n   for a client server protocol for a print system, including (1)\n\
    \   submitting print jobs to and (2) managing print jobs in a spooler\n   Event\
    \ - a state change in the printer\n   Group -- a collection of objects that represent\
    \ a type of sub-unit of\n   the printer\n   IANA - Internet Assigned Numbers Authority.\
    \  See STD 2, RFC 1700.\n   Idempotent -- Idempotence is the property of an operation\
    \ that\n   results in the same state no matter how many times it is executed (at\n\
    \   least once).  This is a property that is shared by true databases in\n   which\
    \ operations on data items only change the state of the data item\n   and do not\
    \ have other side effects.  Because the SNMP data model is\n   that of operations\
    \ on a database, SNMP MIB objects should be assumed\n   to be idempotent.  If\
    \ a MIB object is defined in a non-idempotent\n   way, the this data model can\
    \ break in subtle ways when faced with\n   packet loss, multiple managers, and\
    \ other common conditions.\n   In order to fulfill the common need for actions\
    \ to result from SNMP\n   Set operations, SNMP MIB objects can be modeled such\
    \ that the change\n   in state from one state to another has the side effect of\
    \ causing an\n   action.  It is important to note that with this model, an SNMP\n\
    \   operation that sets a value equal to its current value will cause no\n   action.\
    \  This retains the idempotence of a single command, while\n   allowing actions\
    \ to be initiated by SNMP SET requests.\n   For example, a switch like the foot\
    \ switch that changes from high\n   beams to low beams is not idempotent. If the\
    \ command is received\n   multiple times the result may be different than if the\
    \ command was\n   received a single time.  In the SNMP world preferred commands\
    \ would\n   be \"set lights to high beam\" and \"set lights to low beam\".  These\n\
    \   commands yield predictable results when executed perhaps multiple\n   times.\
    \  A command like \"press foot toggle switch\", is not idempotent\n   because\
    \ when executed an unknown number of times, it yields an\n   indeterminate result.\n\

  contents:
  - "Background\n   The need for Role Models stemmed in large part from the need to\n\
    \   understand the importance any given managed object under\n   consideration\
    \ for inclusion in the specification.  Many times the\n   presence or nature of\
    \ a particular proposed object would be debated\n   within the group; the debate\
    \ would typically end when one or more\n   persons would describe the potential\
    \ usage for the object, usually in\n   terms of a \"live\" person operating in\
    \ some target environment.\n   Steve Zilles (Adobe) first mentioned that he had\
    \ considered this\n   general problem and had come up with a short list of categories\
    \ by\n   which the group can evaluate the relative utility of a proposed\n   object.\
    \  The list Steve described was:\n    - User\n    - Trained Operator\n    - Service\n\
    \   Upon further examination of the overall problem I found it useful to\n   expand\
    \ the list of categories, as well as attempt to define a basic\n   set of \"requirements\
    \ areas\" that can help define the basic nature of\n   each category.\n   Every\
    \ concept needs a name, and this concept is no different.  For\n   lack of better\
    \ alternatives, I refer to these categories as \"Role\n   Models\" in this document.\
    \  This name was chosen in light of the fact\n   that many times we try to find\
    \ a \"person\" (or similar entity) for\n   which the use of a proposed object\
    \ is targeted.  (I resisted the\n   temptation to use the term \"Usage Models,\"\
    \ as I felt the term was too\n   generic in nature.)\n   In presenting the initial\
    \ list of Role Models, the initial set of\n   \"requirements areas\" are presented,\
    \ followed by the set of Role Model\n   definitions.  Finally, a simple matrix\
    \ is presented in which Role\n   Models and requirements areas are cross-compared.\n\
    \   It should be emphasized at this point that all of this is proposed as\n  \
    \ initial information for further discussion.  No doubt major changes\n   will\
    \ be proposed by members of the group as time goes on.\n"

  - "Proposed Print System Requirements Areas\n   Surrounding printers and printing\
    \ systems, the following list of\n   \"requirement areas\" is proposed as a \"\
    check list\" of needs for the\n   various Role Models:\n  Printer job state -\
    \ Determine the status of a job without a printer.\n  Printer capabilities - Determine\
    \ the current capabilities of a\n     printer, for example, the available media\
    \ sizes, two-sided\n     printing, a particular type of interpreter, etc.\n  Printer\
    \ job submission - Submit a print job to a printer.\n  Printer job removal - Remove\
    \ a job from a printer.\n  Notification of events - Receive notification of the\
    \ existence of a\n     defined printer event.  An event can be of many types,\
    \ including\n     warnings, errors, job stage completion (e.g., \"job done\"),\
    \ etc.\n  Printer configuration - Query the current configuration of a\n     printer.\n\
    \  Printer consumables - Determine the current state of any and all\n     consumables\
    \ within a printer.\n  Print job identification - Determine the identification\
    \ of a job\n     within a printer.\n  Internal printer status - Determine the\
    \ current status of the\n     printer.\n  Printer identification - Determine the\
    \ identify of a printer.\n  Printer location - Determine the physical location\
    \ of a printer.\n  Local system configuration - Determine various aspects of the\n\
    \     current configuration of the local system involved with the\n     operation\
    \ of a printer.\n   These \"requirements\" cover a large spectrum of requirements\n\
    \   surrounding the operation of a printer in a network environment.\n   This\
    \ list is by no means complete, but serves as a starting point for\n   assessing\
    \ major requirements of the various Role Models described\n   below.\n"
- title: Proposed Role Models
  contents:
  - "Proposed Role Models\n   Following is a proposed list of \"Role Models\" to be\
    \ used in\n   evaluating the requirements for any given object defined within\
    \ the\n   Printer MIB.  Note that the keyword enclosed in parentheses\n   represents\
    \ an abbreviation for the particular Role Model in the\n   matrix described later\
    \ in this document.\n  User  (USER) - A person or application that submits print\
    \ jobs to\n     the printer; typically viewed as the \"end user\" within the overall\n\
    \     printing environment.\n  Operator  (OP) - A person responsible for maintaining\
    \ a printer on a\n     day-to-day basis, including such tasks as filling empty\
    \ media\n     trays, emptying full output trays, replacing toner cartridges,\n\
    \     etc.\n  Technician  (TECH) - A person responsible for repairing a\n    \
    \ malfunctioning printer, performing routine preventive maintenance,\n     and\
    \ other tasks that typically require advanced training on the\n     printer internals.\
    \  An example of a \"technician\" would be a\n     manufacturer's Field Service\
    \ representative, or other person\n     formally trained by the manufacturer or\
    \ similar representative.\n  System Manager  (MGR) - A person responsible for\
    \ configuration and\n     troubleshooting of components involved in the overall\
    \ printing\n     environment, including printers, print queues and network\n \
    \    connectivity issues.  This person is typically responsible for\n     ensuring\
    \ the overall operational integrity of the print system\n     components, and\
    \ is typically viewed as the central point of\n     coordination among all other\
    \ Role Models.\n  Help Desk  (HELP) - A person responsible for supporting Users\
    \ in\n     their printing needs, including training Users and troubleshooting\n\
    \     Users' printing problems.\n  Asset Manager  (AM) - A person responsible\
    \ for managing an\n     organizations printing system assets (primarily printers).\
    \  Such a\n     person needs to be able to identify and track the location of\n\
    \     printing assets on an ongoing basis.\n  Capacity Planner  (CP) - A person\
    \ responsible for tracking the usage\n     of printing resources on an ongoing\
    \ basis.  An optional related\n     activity might be to acquire printing resource\
    \ utilization\n     information for the purposes of charging Users for resources\
    \ used.\n  Installer  (INST) - A person or application responsible for\n     installing\
    \ or configuring printing system components on a local\n     system.\n   The purpose\
    \ of these Role Models is to evaluate the relative merit of\n   any given managed\
    \ object.  Whenever a managed object is proposed for\n   inclusion into the specification,\
    \ discussion on its expected value\n   should be geared around which Role Models\
    \ benefit from its presence\n   and operation.\n"
- title: Matrix of Requirement Areas and Role Models
  contents:
  - "Matrix of Requirement Areas and Role Models\n   To better understand the relationship\
    \ between the set of defined\n   \"Requirements Areas\" and the various \"Role\
    \ Models,\" the following\n   matrix is offered.\n   It is important to recognize\
    \ that many of the requirements areas will\n   appear to be applicable to many\
    \ of the Role Models.  However, when\n   considering the actual context of a requirement\
    \ area, it is very\n   important to realize that often the actual context of a\
    \ requirement\n   is such the Role Model can change.\n   For example, it is obvious\
    \ that a \"System Manager\" must be able to\n   submit print jobs to a printer;\
    \ however, when submitting a print job\n   a person identified as a \"System Manager\"\
    \ is actually operating in\n   the context of a \"User\" in this case; hence,\
    \ the requirement to\n   submit a print job is not listed as a requirement for\
    \ a System\n   Manager.\n   Conversely, while a \"User\" must be able to remove\
    \ a job previously\n   submitted to a printer, an \"Operator\" is often expected\
    \ to be able to\n   remove any print job from any printer; hence, print job removal\
    \ is a\n   (subtly different) requirement for both \"User\" and an \"Operator\"\
    \ Role\n   Models.\n   That being said, I'm sure you'll find some inconsistencies\
    \ in the\n   following matrix, depending on your particular interpretations of\
    \ the\n   various requirements areas.\n                       Role Models\n  \
