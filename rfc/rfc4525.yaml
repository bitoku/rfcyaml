  - "Abstract\n   This document describes an extension to the Lightweight Directory\n\
    \   Access Protocol (LDAP) Modify operation to support an increment\n   capability.\
    \  This extension is useful in provisioning applications,\n   especially when\
    \ combined with the assertion control and/or the pre-\n   read or post-read control\
    \ extension.\n"

- title: 1.  Background and Intended Use
  contents:
  - "1.  Background and Intended Use\n   The Lightweight Directory Access Protocol\
    \ (LDAP) [RFC4510] does not\n   currently provide an operation to increment values\
    \ of an attribute.\n   A client must read the values of the attribute and then\
    \ modify those\n   values to increment them by the desired amount.  As the values\
    \ may be\n   updated by other clients between this add and modify, the client\
    \ must\n   be careful to construct the modify request so that it fails in this\n\
    \   case, and upon failure, to re-read the values and construct a new\n   modify\
    \ request.\n   This document extends the LDAP Modify Operation [RFC4511] to support\n\
    \   an increment values capability.  This feature is intended to be used\n   with\
    \ either the LDAP pre-read or post-read control extensions\n   [RFC4527].  This\
    \ feature may also be used with the LDAP assertion\n   control extension [RFC4528]\
    \ to provide test-and-increment\n   functionality.\n   In this document key words\
    \ \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\",\n   \"SHALL NOT\", \"SHOULD\"\
    , \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and\n   \"OPTIONAL\" are to be interpreted\
    \ as described in BCP 14 [RFC2119].\n"
- title: 2.  The Modify-Increment Extension
  contents:
  - "2.  The Modify-Increment Extension\n   This document extends the LDAP Modify\
    \ request to support a increment\n   values capability.  Implementations of this\
    \ extension SHALL support\n   an additional ModifyRequest operation enumeration\
    \ value increment\n   (3), as described herein.  Implementations not supporting\
    \ this\n   extension will treat this value as they would an unlisted value,\n\
    \   e.g., as a protocol error.\n   The increment (3) operation value specifies\
    \ that an increment values\n   modification is requested.  All existing values\
    \ of the modification\n   attribute are to be incremented by the listed value.\
    \  The\n   modification attribute must be appropriate for the request (e.g., it\n\
    \   must have INTEGER or other increment-able values), and the\n   modification\
    \ must provide one and only one value.  If the attribute\n   is not appropriate\
    \ for the request, a constraintViolation or other\n   appropriate error is to\
    \ be returned.  If multiple values are\n   provided, a protocolError is to be\
    \ returned.\n   Servers supporting this feature SHOULD publish the object identifier\n\
    \   (OID) 1.3.6.1.1.14  as a value of the 'supportedFeatures' [RFC4512]\n   attribute\
    \ in the root DSE.  Clients supporting this feature SHOULD\n   NOT use the feature\
    \ unless they know the server supports it.\n"
- title: 3. LDIF Support
  contents:
  - "3. LDIF Support\n   To represent Modify-Increment requests in LDAP Data Interchange\n\
    \   Format [RFC2849], the ABNF [RFC4234] production <mod-spec> is\n   extended\
    \ as follows:\n       mod-spec =/ \"increment:\" FILL AttributeDescription SEP\n\
    \            attrval-spec \"-\" SEP\n   For example,\n       # Increment uidNumber\n\
    \       dn: cn=max-assigned uidNumber,dc=example,dc=com\n       changetype: modify\n\
    \       increment: uidNumber\n       uidNumber: 1\n       -\n   This LDIF fragment\
    \ represents a Modify request to increment the\n   value(s) of uidNumber by 1.\n"
- title: 4.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "4.  Security Considerations\n   General LDAP security considerations [RFC4510],\
    \ as well as those\n   specific to the LDAP Modify [RFC4511], apply to this Modify-Increment\n\
    \   extension.  Beyond these considerations, it is noted that\n   introduction\
    \ of this extension should reduce application complexity\n   (by providing one\
    \ operation for what presently requires multiple\n   operations) and, hence, it\
    \ may aid in the production of correct and\n   secure implementations.\n"
