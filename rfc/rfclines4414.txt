Abstract This document describes an Internet Registry Information Service (IRIS)
registry schema for registered ENUM information.
The schema extends the necessary query and result operations of IRIS to provide the functional information service needs for syntaxes and results used by ENUM registries.
This document describes an IRIS registry schema for registries of ENUM data using an XML Schema [4] derived from and using the IRIS [5] schema.
The schema given is this document is specified using the Extensible Markup Language (XML) 1.0 as described in XML [1], XML Schema notation as described in XML SD [3] and XML SS [4], and XML Namespaces as described in XML NS [2].
The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [10].
This document uses the term "ENUM" as the fully qualified domain name following the conventions of ENUM [17].
Schema Description IRIS requires the derivation of both query and result elements by a registry schema.
References to XML elements with no namespace qualifier are from the schema defined in Section 4.
References to elements and attributes with the "iris" XML namespace qualifier are from the schema defined in IRIS [5].
The descriptions contained within this section refer to XML elements and attributes and their relation to the exchange of data within the protocol.
These descriptions also contain specifications outside the scope of the formal XML syntax.
Therefore, this section will use terms defined by RFC 2119 [10] to describe the specification outside the scope of the formal XML syntax.
While reading this section, please reference Section 4 for needed details on the formal XML syntax.
<findEnumsByE164> Query <findEnumsByE164> finds ENUM domains by searching on prefixes of E.164 numbers and returns <enum
The E.164 prefix is specified using the <e164Prefix> child of <findEnumsByE164>.
An optional child element of <findEnumsByE164>, <specificity>, can narrow the search to ENUM domains associated with E.164 numbers that are either more specific or less specific.
If the <specificity> element is present and has the content 'less', then the search is to be narrowed to E.164 numbers that are less specific (i.e., have fewer digits).
If the <specificity> element is present and has the content 'more', then the search is to be narrowed to E.164 numbers that are more specific (i.e., have more digits).
<findEnumsByContact> Query <findEnumsByContact> finds ENUM domains by searches on fields associated with an ENUM domain's contact.
The allowable search fields are handled with either the <contactHandle> element or one of the elements in the "contactSearchGroup" (see Section 3.1.5).
The <contactHandle> element allows for the ENUM domains to be selected based on the contact having the specified contact handle.
The query MAY also be constrained further using the optional <role> element.
The contents of this element signify the role the contact has with the ENUM domain.
This query also provides optional <language> elements containing language tags.
Clients MAY use these elements to give a hint about the natural language(s) of the affected element.
Servers MAY use this information in processing the query, such as tailoring normalization routines to aid in more effective searches.
<findContacts> Query <findContacts> searches for contacts given search constraints.
The allowable search fields are handled by one of the elements in the "contactSearchGroup" (see Section 3.1.5).
This query also provides optional <language> elements containing language tags.
Clients MAY use these elements to give a hint about the natural language(s) of the affected element.
Servers MAY use this information in processing the query, such as tailoring normalization routines to aid in more effective searches.
> Query This query does a simple search for the ENUM domains being hosted by a name server.
The search is constrained using either the host name [12], host handle, IPv4 address, or IPv6 address of the name server.
Some of the queries above have similar query constraints for searching on contacts.
This section describes those common parameters.
> allows the query to be constrained based on the common name of the contact.
The constraint can either constrain the query by an exact match using the <exactMatch> element, or it may constrain the query by a subset of the common name using the <beginsWith> and <endsWith> elements.
<organization> allows the query to be constrained based on the organization name of the contact.
It has the same semantics as the <commonName> element.
> constrains the query based on the e mail address of the contact.
This may be done by an exact e mail address using the <exactMatch
> element or by any e mail address in a domain using the <inDomain> element.
If either the contents of the <inDomain> element or domain part of the contents of the <exactMatch> element contain a name with non ASCII characters, they MUST be normalized according to the processes of RFC 3491 [15].
The <city>, <region>, and <postalCode> elements restrict the scope of the query based on the city, region, or postal code of the contact, respectively.
Each one must only contain an <exactMatch> element containing the exact city, region, or postal code (i.e., no substring searches).
Privacy Labels Several of the results in this registry type have values that cannot be given but must be specified as present or must be flagged so that clients do not divulge them.
In order to achieve this, some of the results use the following element types:
"dateTimePrivacyType" contains the XML Schema [3] data type "dateTime".
The contents of this element MUST be specified using the 'Z' indicator for Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).
"stringPrivacyType" contains the XML Schema [3] data type "string".
"normalizedStringPrivacyType" contains the XML Schema [3] data type "normalizedString".
"tokenPrivacyType" contains the XML Schema [3] data type "token".
"enumStatusType" describes a state for an ENUM domain.
'disposition' contains either the value "pending", meaning that initial processing for this status has begun and is not yet complete, or the value "prohibited", meaning this ENUM domain cannot achieve this status according to either the registry or registrar of this ENUM domain.
'actor' contains either the value "registry", meaning this status value has been associated with this ENUM domain by the registry, or the value "registrar", meaning this status value has been associated with this ENUM domain by the registrar.
> indicates the date and time the status was applied.
<description> provides a textual description of the status.
This element has a required 'language' attribute.
> indicates a jurisdictional dependent reason for this status value.
This element has a required 'authority' attribute to indicate the jurisdictional authority associated with this sub status.
"contactTypeType" contains an optional <description> child elements.
Each <description> child element requires a 'language' attribute.
As specified, they are nillable and therefore may be present with empty content or present with their specified content.
The use of these elements is also optional.
If present without content, each of these element types MUST have one or more of the following boolean attributes:  'private'
if true, this specifies that the content is absent because it may never be published.
'denied' if true, this specifies that the content is absent because policy does not allow it to be given under the current level of access.
If present with content, each of these element types MAY have one or more of the following boolean attributes:  'doNotRedistribute'
if true, this specifies that the content is not to be redistributed.
'specialAccess' if true, this specifies that the content has been provided due to special access rights.
These boolean attributes SHOULD be used in accordance with the level of access being granted the recipient of the data.
For example, marking data as 'private' or 'denied' is to be expected if the user is anonymous or has some other low level of access that does not warrant viewing of that particular data.
Likewise, data marked with 'doNotRedistribute' or 'specialAccess'
is to be expected if the user is authenticated and has a high level of access.
Contact Group Many of the results share a set of references to contacts regarding an associated role.
These are represented by the following elements:  <billingContact
> Each of these elements contains an entity reference.
The referent of each MUST be a <contact> (Section 3.2.5).
An example of a <enum> result:
> <nameServer iris:referentType "ereg:host" authority "3.0.7.1.e164.arpa" registryType "ereg1" entityClass "host handle"
host" authority "3.0.7.1.e164.arpa" registryType "ereg1" entityClass "host handle" entityName "ns2.001
<registrant iris:referentType "ereg:contact" authority "3.0.7.1.e164.arpa" registryType "ereg1" entityClass "contact handle" entityName "beb140"
displayName language "en"> Bill Eckels </iris:displayName> </registrant> <technicalContact iris:
referentType "ereg:contact" authority "3.0.7.1.e164.arpa" registryType "ereg1" entityClass "contact handle" entityName "mak21"
:displayName> </technicalContact> <status> <create/> <active/> <delete actor "registrar" disposition "prohibited"> <subStatus authority "regr.example">
> </delete> <update actor "registrar" disposition "prohibited"> <subStatus authority "regr.example">
> </update> <transfer actor "registrar" disposition "prohibited"
> <subStatus authority "registrar.example"> AUTO LOCK </subStatus
> </transfer> <redemptionPeriod actor "registry" disposition "pending"> <subStatus authority "policy body.example">
The <enum> result represents an instance of an ENUM domain assignment.
The children of the <enum> element are as follows:  <e164Number>

It is RECOMMENDED that only space characters be used between the digits of these E.164 numbers, as of the international number format defined in [14].
a registry unique assigned identifier to an ENUM domain.
<nameServer> MUST contain an entity reference to a referent of type <host> (Section 3.2.4).
<registrant> elements containing an entity reference to the registrant of this ENUM domain.
The referent MUST be a <contact> (Section 3.2.5) result.
ENUM domain contacts see Section 3.2.2.
<status> may contain at least one of the following elements of type 'enumStatusType' (see Section 3.2.1).
registrant assignment is in dispute
> period at the creation or activation of this ENUM domain (see RFC 3915 [18])
<renewPeriod> period at the renewal of this ENUM domain
> period at the transfer of this ENUM domain (see RFC 3915 [18])
> period at the redemption of this ENUM domain
> change to previous status of this ENUM domain
a status only defined by its <subStatus> child element As stated in Section 3.2.1, each status value may have flags to indicate the entity responsible for assigning the status (e.g., actor 'registrar') and the nature of the status (e.g., disposition "prohibited").
Any one status value MUST NOT imply other status values.
For instance, <reserved> is just an indication that the ENUM domain is given special reserved status; the <create disposition "prohibited"/> status value must also be present to indicate that the ENUM domain cannot be registered.
<registrationReference> an element containing an entity reference, the referent of which MUST be an <enum> (Section 3.2.3).
The intention of this element is to point to the downstream registration reference.
Therefore, if this is a result given back by an ENUM domain registry, it should point to the ENUM domain in the ENUM domain registrar or registrant service.

Blocks Extensible Exchange Protocol (BEEP)
Transport Compliance IRIS allows several extensions of the core capabilities.
This section outlines those extensions allowable by IRIS BEEP [6].
This registry type uses the default message pattern as described in IRIS BEEP [6].
This registry type only uses the basic Transport Layer Security (TLS) server authentication method as described in IRIS BEEP [6].
The application service label associated with this registry type MUST be "EREG1".
This is the abbreviated form of the URN for this registry type, urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:ereg1.
Internationalization Considerations Implementers should be aware of considerations for internationalization in IRIS [5].
The social data associated with contacts may be non ASCII, and could contain virtually any Unicode character.
The <language> element is provided in queries that have potential to traverse such data.
Clients should use these elements to indicate to the server of the target languages desired, and servers should use these elements to better enable normalization and search processes (see <http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr15/>).
Clients needing to localize the data tags in this protocol should take note that localization is only needed on the names of XML elements and attributes with the exception of elements containing date and time information.
The schema for this registry has been designed so that clients need not interpret the content of elements or attributes for localization, other than those elements containing date and time information.
Clients should also make use of the <language> elements provided in many of the results.
Results containing data that may be in Unicode are accompanied by these elements in order to aid better presentation of the data to the user.
The "dateTimePrivacyType" element content conforms to the XML Schema [3] data type "dateTime".
The contents of this element MUST be specified using the 'Z' indicator for Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).
This document makes use of a proposed XML namespace and schema registry specified in XML URN [16].
Accordingly, the following registration information is provided for the IANA:
The XML Schema specified in Section 4  URN
The following S NAPTR application service tag [20] has been registered with IANA according to the IANA considerations defined in IRIS [5]:
The following BEEP Profile URI has been registered with IANA (http://www.iana.org/assignments/beep parameters), in addition to the registration provided in IRIS BEEP [6].
This document lays out no new considerations for security precautions beyond that specified in IRIS [5].
