- title: 1. Introduction
  contents:
  - "1. Introduction\n   Many different Internet standards and RFCs define headers\
    \ which may\n   occur on Internet Mail Messages and Usenet News Articles. The\n\
    \   intention of this document is to list all such headers in one\n   document\
    \ as an aid to people developing message systems or interested\n   in Internet\
    \ Mail standards.\n   The document contains all headers which the author has found\
    \ in the\n   following Internet standards: , RFC 822 [2], RFC 1036 [3], RFC 1123\n\
    \   [5], RFC 1327 [7], RFC 1496 [8], RFC 1521 [11], RFC 1766 [12], RFC\n   1806\
    \ [14], RFC 1864[17] and RFC 1911[20]. Note in particular that\n   heading attributes\
    \ defined in PEM (RFC 1421-1424) and MOSS (RFC 1848\n   [16]) are not included.\
    \ PEM and MOSS headers only appear inside the\n   body of a message, and thus\
    \ are not headers in the RFC 822 sense.\n   Mail attributes in envelopes, i.e.\
    \ attributes controlling the message\n   transport mechanism between mail and\
    \ news servers, are not included.\n   This means that attributes from SMTP [1],\
    \ UUCP [18] and NNTP [15] are\n   mainly not covered either. Headings used only\
    \ in HTTP [19] are not\n   included yet, but may be included in future version\
    \ of this memo. A\n   few additional headers which often can be found in e-mail\
    \ headings\n   but are not part of any Internet standard are also included.\n\
    \   For each header, the document gives a short description and a\n   reference\
    \ to the Internet standard or RFC, in which they are defined.\n   The header names\
    \ given here are spelled the same way as when they are\n   actually used. This\
    \ is usually American but sometimes English\n   spelling.  One header in particular,\
    \ \"Organisation/Organization\",\n   occurs in e-mail headers sometimes with the\
    \ English and other times\n   with the American spelling.\n   The following words\
    \ are used in this memo with the meaning specified\n   below:\n   heading    \
    \       Formatted text at the top of a message, ended by a\n                 \
    \    blank line\n   header = heading  One field in the heading, beginning with\
    \ a field\n   field             name, colon, and followed by the field value(s)\n\
    \   It is my intention to continue updating this document after its\n   publication\
    \ as an RFC. The latest version, which may be more up-to-\n   date (but also less\
    \ fully checked out) will be kept available for\n   downloading from URL\n   http://www.dsv.su.se/~jpalme/ietf-mail-attributes.pdf.\n\
    \   Please e-mail me (Jacob Palme <jpalme@dsv.su.se>) if you have noted\n   headers\
    \ which should be included in this memo but are not.\n"
- title: 2. Use of gatewaying headers
  contents:
  - "2. Use of gatewaying headers\n   RFC 1327 defines a number of new headers in\
    \ Internet mail, which are\n   defined to map headers which X.400 has but which\
    \ were previously not\n   standardized in Internet mail. The fact that a header\
    \ occurs in RFC\n   1327 indicates that it is recommended for use in gatewaying\
    \ messages\n   between X.400 and Internet mail, but does not mean that the header\
    \ is\n   recommended for messages wholly within Internet mail. Some of these\n\
    \   headers may eventually see widespread implementation and use in\n   Internet\
    \ mail, but at the time of this writing (1996) they are not\n   widely implemented\
    \ or used.\n   Headers defined only in RFC 1036 for use in Usenet News sometimes\n\
    \   appear in mail messages, either because the messages have been\n   gatewayed\
    \ from Usenet News to e-mail, or because the messages were\n   written in combined\
    \ clients supporting both e-mail and Usenet News in\n   the same client. These\
    \ headers are not standardized for use in\n   Internet e-mail and should be handled\
    \ with caution by e-mail agents.\n"

    \ When appearing in\n                           e-mail, they should be handled\
    \ with caution.\n                           Note that RFC 1036, although generally\
    \ used as\n                           a de-facto standard for Usenet News, is\
    \ not an\n                           official IETF standard or even on the IETF\n\
    \                           standards track.\n   \"non-standard\"          This\
    \ header is not specified in any of\n                           referenced RFCs\
    \ which define Internet\n                           protocols, including Internet\
    \ Standards, draft\n                           standards or proposed standards.\
    \ The header\n                           appears here because it often appears\
    \ in e-\n                           mail or Usenet News. Usage of these headers\
    \ is\n                           not in general recommended. Some header\n   \
    \                        proposed in ongoing IETF standards development\n    \
    \                       work, but not yet accepted, are also marked in\n     \
    \                      this way.\n   \"discouraged\"           This header, which\
    \ is non-standard, is known\n                           to create problems and\
    \ should not be\n                           generated. Handling of such headers\
    \ in\n                           incoming mail should be done with great\n   \
    \                        caution.\n   \"controversial\"         The meaning and\
    \ usage of this header is\n                           controversial, i.e. different\
    \ implementors\n                           have chosen to implement the header\
    \ in\n                           different ways. Because of this, such headers\n\
    \                           should be handled with caution and\n             \
    \              understanding of the different possible\n                     \
    \      interpretations.\n   \"experimental\"          This header is used for\
    \ newly defined headers,\n                           which are to be tried out\
    \ before entering the\n                           IETF standards track. These\
    \ should only be\n                           used if both communicating parties\
    \ agree on\n                           using them. In practice, some experimental\n\
    \                           protocols become de-facto-standards before\n     \
    \                      they are made into IETF standards.\n"
