  contents:
  - "Observations\n   Sometimes an implementation is mistaken for a standard.  POP3\
    \ servers\n   and clients are no exception.  The widely-used UCB POP3 server,\n\
    \   popper, which has been further developed by Qualcomm, always has\n   additional\
    \ information following the status indicator.  So, the\n   status indicator always\
    \ has a space following it.  Two POP3 clients\n   have been observed to expect\
    \ that space, and fail when it has not\n   been found.  The RFC does not require\
    \ the space, hence this memo.\n   These clients are the freely copyable Unix \"\
    popclient\" and the\n   proprietary \"netApp Systems Internet Series\".  The authors\
    \ of both of\n   these have been contacted, and new releases will not expect the\n\
    \   space, but old versions should be supported.\n   In addition, two popular\
    \ clients require optional parts of the RFC.\n   Netscape requires UIDL, and Eudora\
    \ requires TOP.\n   The optional APOP authentication command has not achieved\
    \ wide\n   penetration yet.  Newer versions of the Qualcomm POP server implement\n\
    \   it.  Known client implementations of APOP include GNU Emacs VM client\n  \
    \ and Eudora Lite and Eudora Pro.\n"
