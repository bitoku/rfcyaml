- title: Abstract
  contents:
  - "Abstract\n   Many transport services require that user traffic, in the form of\n\
    \   Pseudowires (PWs), be delivered via either a single co-routed\n   bidirectional\
    \ tunnel or two unidirectional tunnels that share the\n   same routes.  This document\
    \ defines an optional extension to the\n   Label Distribution Protocol (LDP) that\
    \ enables the binding between\n   PWs and the underlying Traffic Engineering (TE)\
    \ tunnels.  The\n   extension applies to both single-segment and multi-segment\
    \ PWs.\n"

  - "1.  Introduction\n   Pseudo Wire Emulation Edge-to-Edge (PWE3) [RFC3985] is a\
    \ mechanism to\n   emulate Layer 2 services, such as Ethernet Point-to-Point circuits.\n\
    \   Such services are emulated between two Attachment Circuits, and the\n   Pseudowire-encapsulated\
    \ Layer 2 service payload is transported via\n   Packet Switching Network (PSN)\
    \ tunnels between Provider Edges (PEs).\n   PWE3 typically uses the Label Distribution\
    \ Protocol (LDP) [RFC5036]\n   or Resource Reservation Protocol - Traffic Engineering\
    \ (RSVP-TE)\n   [RFC3209] Label Switched Paths (LSPs) as PSN tunnels.  The PEs\
    \ select\n   and bind the Pseudowires to PSN tunnels independently.  Today, there\n\
    \   is no standardized protocol-based provisioning mechanism to associate\n  \
    \ PWs with PSN tunnels; such associations must be managed via\n   provisioning\
    \ or other private methods.\n   PW-to-PSN Tunnel Binding has become increasingly\
    \ common and important\n   in many deployment scenarios, as it allows service\
    \ providers to offer\n   service level agreements to their customers for such\
    \ traffic\n   attributes as bandwidth, latency, and availability.\n   The requirements\
    \ for explicit control of PW-to-LSP mapping are\n   described in Section 5.3.2\
    \ of [RFC6373].  Figure 1 illustrates how\n   PWs can be bound to particular LSPs.\n\
    \                      +------+                  +------+\n            ---AC1\

    \               Figure 1: Explicit PW-to-LSP Binding Scenario\n   There are two\
    \ PEs (PE1 and PE2) connected through multiple parallel\n   links that may be\
    \ on different physical fibers.  Each link is managed\n   and controlled as a\
    \ bidirectional LSP.  At each PE, there are a large\n   number of bidirectional\
    \ user flows from multiple Ethernet interfaces\n   (access circuits in the figure).\
    \  Each user flow utilizes a pair of\n   unidirectional PWs to carry bidirectional\
    \ traffic.  The operators\n   need to make sure that the user flows (that is,\
    \ the PW-pairs) are\n   carried on the same fiber or bidirectional LSP.\n   There\
    \ are a number of reasons behind this requirement.  First, due to\n   delay and\
    \ latency constraints, traffic going over different fibers\n   may require a large\
    \ amount of expensive buffer memory to compensate\n   for the differential delay\
    \ at the head-end nodes.  Further, the\n   operators may apply different protection\
    \ mechanisms on different\n   parts of the network (e.g., to deploy 1:1 protection\
    \ in one part and\n   1+1 protection in other parts).  As such, operators may\
    \ prefer to\n   have a user's traffic traverse the same fiber.  That implies that\n\
    \   both forwarding and reserve direction PWs that belong to the same\n   user\
    \ flow need to be mapped to the same co-routed bidirectional LSP\n   or two LSPs\
    \ with the same route.\n   Figure 2 illustrates a scenario where PW-LSP binding\
    \ is not applied.\n                    +----+   +--+ LSP1 +--+   +----+\n    \

    \ SS-PW-to-LSP Binding Scenario\n   LSP1 and LSP2 are two bidirectional connections\
    \ on diverse paths.\n   The operator needs to deliver a bidirectional flow between\
    \ PE1 and\n   PE2.  Using existing mechanisms, it's possible that PE1 may select\n\
    \   LSP1 (PE1-P1-P2-PE2) as the PSN tunnel for traffic from PE1 to PE2,\n   while\
    \ selecting LSP2 (PE2-P3-PE1) as the PSN tunnel for traffic from\n   PE2 to PE1.\n\
    \   Consequently, the user traffic is delivered over two disjointed LSPs\n   that\
    \ may have very different service attributes in terms of latency\n   and protection.\
    \  This may not be acceptable as a reliable and\n   effective transport service\
    \ to the customer.\n   A similar problem may also exist in multi-segment PWs (MS-PWs),\
    \ where\n   user traffic on a particular PW may hop over different networks in\n\
    \   forward and reverse directions.\n   One way to solve this problem is by introducing\
    \ manual provisioning\n   at each PE to bind the PWs to the underlying PSN tunnels.\
    \  However,\n   this is prone to configuration errors and does not scale.\n  \
    \ This document introduces an automatic solution by extending\n   Forwarding Equivalence\
    \ Class (FEC) 128/129 PW based on [RFC4447].\n"

  - "3.  LDP Extensions\n   This document defines a new optional TLV, the PSN Tunnel\
    \ Binding TLV,\n   to communicate tunnel/LSP selection and binding requests between\
    \ PEs.\n   The TLV carries a PW's binding profile and provides explicit or\n \
    \  implicit information for the underlying PSN Tunnel Binding operation.\n   The\
    \ binding operation applies in both single-segment (SS) and multi-\n   segment\
    \ (MS) scenarios.\n   The extension supports two types of binding requests:\n\
    \   1.  Strict binding: The requesting PE will choose and explicitly\n       indicate\
    \ the LSP information in the requests; the receiving PE\n       MUST obey the\
    \ requests; otherwise, the PW will not be\n       established.\n   2.  Co-routed\
    \ binding: The requesting PE will suggest an underlying\n       LSP to a remote\
    \ PE.  Upon receipt, the remote PE has the option\n       to use the suggested\
    \ LSP or reply to the information for an\n       alternative.\n   In this document,\

    \ ID.  The term \"LSP\" is identical\n   to the \"LSP tunnel\" defined in Section\
    \ 2.1 of [RFC3209], which is\n   uniquely identified by the SESSION object together\
    \ with the\n   SENDER_TEMPLATE (or FILTER_SPEC) object that consists of the LSP\

    \ T-bit is set, the Source/Destination LSP\n   Number fields MUST be zero and\
    \ ignored during processing.  Otherwise,\n   both Source/Destination LSP Number\
    \ fields MUST have the actual LSP\n   IDs of specific LSPs.\n   Each PSN Tunnel\
    \ Binding TLV MUST only have one such sub-TLV.  When\n   sending, only one sub-TLV\
    \ MUST be carried.  When received, if there\n   are more than one sub-TLVs carried,\

    \ desired\n   reverse tunnels/LSPs.\n   Specifically, to set up a PW (or PW Segment),\
    \ a PE may select a\n   candidate tunnel/LSP to act as the PSN tunnel.  If no\
    \ candidate is\n   available or none satisfy the constraints, the PE will trigger\
    \ and\n   establish a new tunnel/LSP.  The selected tunnel/LSP information is\n\
    \   carried in the PSN Tunnel Binding TLV and sent with the Label Mapping\n  \
    \ message to the target PE.\n   Upon the reception of the Label Mapping message,\
    \ the receiving PE\n   will process the PSN Tunnel Binding TLV, determine whether\
    \ it can\n   accept the suggested tunnel/LSP or to find the reverse tunnel/LSP\n\
    \   that meets the request, and respond with a Label Mapping message,\n   which\
    \ contains the corresponding PSN Tunnel Binding TLV.\n   It is possible that two\

    \ at the same time.  This may cause\n   collisions of tunnel/LSPs selection as\
    \ both PEs assume the active\n   role.\n   As defined in (Section 7.2.1, [RFC6073]),\
    \ each PE may be categorized\n   into active and passive roles:\n   1.  Active\
    \ PE: The PE that initiates the selection of the tunnel/LSPs\n       and informs\
    \ the remote PE;\n   2.  Passive PE: The PE that obeys the active PE's suggestion.\n\
    \   In the rest of this document, we will elaborate upon the operation\n   for\
    \ SS-PW and MS-PW:\n   1.  SS-PW: In this scenario, both PEs for a particular\
    \ PW may assume\n       the active roles.\n   2.  MS-PW: One PE is active, while\

    \ in SS-PW Environment\n   As outlined previously, there are two types of binding\
    \ requests:\n   co-routed and strict.\n   In strict binding, a PE (e.g., PE1)\
    \ will mandate that the other PE\n   (e.g., PE2) use a specified tunnel/LSP (e.g.,\
    \ LSP1) as the PSN tunnel\n   on the reverse direction.  In the PSN Tunnel Binding\
    \ TLV, the S-bit\n   MUST be set, the C-bit MUST be cleared, and the Source and\n\
    \   Destination IDs/Numbers MUST be filled.\n   Upon receipt, if the S-bit is\
    \ set, as well as following the\n   processing procedure defined in Section 5.3.3\
    \ of [RFC4447], the\n   receiving PE (i.e., PE2) needs to determine whether to\
    \ accept the\n   indicated tunnel/LSP in PSN Tunnel Sub-TLV.\n   The receiving\
    \ PE (PE2) may also be an active PE, and it may have\n   initiated the PSN Binding\
    \ requests to the other PE (PE1); if the\n   received PSN tunnel/LSP is the same\
    \ as was sent in the Label Mapping\n   message by PE2, then the signaling has\
    \ converged on a mutually agreed\n   upon Tunnel/LSP.  The binding operation is\
    \ completed.\n   Otherwise, the receiving PE (PE2) MUST compare its own Node ID\n\
    \   against the received Source Node ID as unsigned integers.  If the\n   received\
    \ Source Node ID is larger, the PE (PE2) will reply with a\n   Label Mapping message\
    \ to complete the PW setup and confirm the\n   binding request.  The PSN Tunnel\
    \ Binding TLV in the message MUST\n   contain the same Source and Destination\
    \ IDs/Numbers as in the\n   received binding request, in the appropriate order\
    \ (where the source\n   is PE2 and PE1 becomes the destination).  On the other\
    \ hand, if the\n   receiving PE (PE2) has a Node ID that is larger than the Source\
    \ Node\n   ID carried in the PSN Tunnel Binding TLV, it MUST reply with a Label\n\
    \   Release message with the status code set to \"Reject - unable to use\n   the\
    \ suggested tunnel/LSPs\", and the received PSN Tunnel Binding TLV,\n   and the\
    \ PW will not be established.\n   To support co-routed binding, the receiving\
    \ PE can select the\n   appropriate PSN tunnel/LSP for the reverse direction of\
    \ the PW, so\n   long as the forwarding and reverse PSNs share the same route\
    \ (links\n   and nodes).\n   Initially, a PE (PE1) sends a Label Mapping message\
    \ to the remote PE\n   (PE2) with the PSN Tunnel Binding TLV, with C-bit set,\
    \ S-bit cleared,\n   and the appropriate Source and Destination IDs/Numbers. \
    \ In case of\n   unidirectional LSPs, the PSN Tunnel Binding TLV may only contain\
    \ the\n   Source IDs/Numbers; the Destination IDs/Numbers are set to zero and\n\
    \   left for PE2 to complete when responding to the Label Mapping\n   message.\n\
    \   Upon receipt, since PE2 is also an active PE, and may have initiated\n   the\
    \ PSN Binding requests to the other PE (PE1), if the received PSN\n   tunnel/LSP\
    \ has the same route as the one that has been sent in the\n   Label Mapping message\
    \ to PE1, then the signaling has converged.  The\n   binding operation is completed.\n\
    \   Otherwise, PE2 needs to compare its own Node ID against the received\n   Source\
    \ Node ID as unsigned integers.  If the received Source Node ID\n   is larger,\
    \ PE2 needs to find/establish a tunnel/LSP that meets the\n   co-routed constraint,\
    \ and reply with a Label Mapping message that has\n   a PSN Binding TLV that contains\
    \ the Source and Destination IDs/\n   Numbers of the tunnel/LSP.  On the other\
    \ hand, if the receiving PE\n   (PE2) has a Node ID that is larger than the Source\
    \ Node ID carried in\n   the PSN Tunnel Binding TLV, it MUST reply with a Label\
    \ Release\n   message that has a status code set to \"Reject - unable to use the\n\
    \   suggested tunnel/LSPs\" (0x0000003B) and the received PSN Tunnel\n   Binding\
    \ TLV.\n   In addition, if the received PSN tunnel/LSP endpoints do not match\n\
    \   the PW endpoints, PE2 MUST reply with a Label Release message with\n   the\
    \ status code set to \"Reject - unable to use the suggested\n   tunnel/LSPs\"\
    \ (0x0000003B) and the received PSN Tunnel Binding TLV\n   MUST also be carried.\n\
    \   In both strict and co-routed bindings, if the T-bit is set, the LSP\n   Number\
    \ field MUST be set to zero.  Otherwise, the field MUST contain\n   the actual\
    \ LSP number for the related PSN LSP.\n   After a PW is established, the operators\
    \ may choose to move the PWs\n   from the current tunnel/LSPs to other tunnel/LSPs.\
    \  Also, the\n   underlying PSN tunnel may break due to a network failure.  When\n\
    \   either of these scenarios occur, a new Label Mapping message MUST be\n   sent\
    \ to notify the remote PE of the changes.  Note that when the\n   T-bit is set,\
    \ the working LSP broken will not provide this update if\n   there are protection\
    \ LSPs in place.\n   The message may carry a new PSN Tunnel Binding TLV, which\
    \ contains\n   the new Source and Destination Numbers/IDs.  The handling of the\
    \ new\n   message should be identical to what has been described in this\n   section.\n\
    \   However, if the new Label Mapping message does not contain the PSN\n   Tunnel\
    \ Binding TLV, it declares the removal of any co-routed/strict\n   constraints.\
    \  The current independent PW-to-PSN Binding will be used.\n   Further, as an\
    \ implementation option, the PEs may choose not to\n   remove the traffic from\
    \ an operational PW until the completion of the\n   underlying PSN tunnel/LSP\
    \ changes.\n"

    \ Binding\n   TLV includes the PSN Tunnel sub-TLV that carries the desired\n \
    \  tunnel/LSP of T-PE1.\n   For strict binding, the initiating PE MUST set the\
    \ S-bit, clear the\n   C-bit, and indicate the binding tunnel/LSP to the next-hop\
    \ S-PE.\n   When S-PE1 receives the Label Mapping message, it needs to determine\n\
    \   if the signaling is for the forward or reverse direction, as defined\n   in\
    \ Section 4.2.3 of [RFC7267].\n   If the Label Mapping message is for the forward\
    \ direction, and S-PE1\n   accepts the requested tunnel/LSPs from T-PE1, S-PE1\

    \   Otherwise, S-PE1 relays the Label Mapping message to the next S-PE\n   (that\
    \ is, S-PE2), with the PSN Tunnel sub-TLV carrying the\n   information of the\

    \ it will reply with a\n   Label Mapping message to initiate the binding process\
    \ in the reverse\n   direction.  The Label Mapping message contains the received\
    \ PSN\n   Tunnel Binding TLV for confirmation purposes.\n   When its upstream\
    \ S-PE (S-PE2) receives the Label Mapping message,\n   the S-PE relays the Label\
    \ Mapping message to its upstream adjacent\n   S-PE (S-PE1), with the previously\
    \ saved PSN tunnel/LSP information in\n   the PSN Tunnel sub-TLV.  The same procedure\
    \ will be applied on\n   subsequent S-PEs, until the message reaches T-PE1 to\
    \ complete the PSN\n   Binding setup.\n   During the binding process, if any PE\
    \ does not agree to the requested\n   tunnel/LSPs, it can send a Label Release\
    \ Message to its upstream\n   adjacent PE with the status code set to \"Reject\
    \ - unable to use the\n   suggested tunnel/LSPs\" (0x0000003B).  In addition,\

    \   code set to \"Reject - unable to use the suggested tunnel/LSPs\"\n   (0x0000003B)\
    \ and the received PSN Tunnel Binding TLV MUST also be\n   carried.\n   For co-routed\

    \ PW between itself and its upstream PE in reverse direction\n   only if the tunnel/LSP\
    \ is co-routed with the forward one.  Otherwise,\n   the procedure is the same\

  - "7.  PSN Tunnel Select Considerations\n   As stated in Section 1, the PSN tunnel\
    \ that is used for binding can\n   be either a co-routed bidirectional LSP or\
    \ two LSPs with the same\n   route.  The co-routed bidirectional LSP has the characteristics\
    \ that\n   both directions not only cross the same nodes and links, but have the\n\
    \   same life span.  But for the two LSPs case, even if they have the\n   same\
    \ route at the beginning, it cannot be guaranteed that they will\n   always have\
    \ the same route all the time.  For example, when Fast\n   ReRoute (FRR) [RFC4090]\
    \ is deployed for the LSPs, link or node\n   failure may make the two LSPs use\
    \ different routes.  So, if the\n   network supports co-routed bidirectional LSPs,\
