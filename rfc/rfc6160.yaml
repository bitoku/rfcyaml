- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   This document describes the conventions for using several\n\
    \   cryptographic algorithms with the Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS)\n   [RFC5652]\
    \ to protect the symmetric key package content type defined\n   in [RFC6031].\
    \  Specifically, it includes conventions necessary to\n   implement the following\
    \ CMS content types: SignedData [RFC5652],\n   EnvelopedData [RFC5652], EncryptedData\
    \ [RFC5652], and\n   AuthEnvelopedData [RFC5083].  Familiarity with [RFC5083],\
    \ [RFC5652],\n   [RFC5753], and [RFC6031] is assumed.\n   This document does not\
    \ define any new algorithms; instead, it refers\n   to previously defined algorithms.\n"

    SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\"\
    , and \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n   document are to be interpreted as described in\
    \ [RFC2119].\n"
- title: 2.  SignedData
  contents:
  - "2.  SignedData\n   If an implementation supports SignedData, then it MUST support\
    \ the\n   signature scheme RSA [RFC3370] and SHOULD support the signature\n  \
    \ schemes RSA Probabilistic Signature Scheme (RSASSA-PSS) [RFC4056] and\n   Digital\
    \ Signature Algorithm (DSA) [RFC3370].  Additionally,\n   implementations MUST\
    \ support the hash function SHA-256 [RFC5754] in\n   concert with these signature\
    \ schemes, and they SHOULD support the\n   hash function SHA-1 [RFC3370].  If\
    \ an implementation supports\n   SignedData, then it MAY support Elliptic Curve\
    \ Digital Signature\n   Algorithm (ECDSA) [RFC6090][RFC5753].\n"
- title: 3.  EnvelopedData
  contents:
  - "3.  EnvelopedData\n   If an implementation supports EnvelopedData, then it MUST\
    \ implement\n   key transport, and it MAY implement key agreement.\n   When key\
    \ transport is used, RSA encryption [RFC3370] MUST be\n   supported, and RSA Encryption\
    \ Scheme - Optimal Asymmetric Encryption\n   Padding (RSAES-OAEP) [RFC3560] SHOULD\
    \ be supported.\n   When key agreement is used, Diffie-Hellman (DH) ephemeral-static\n\
    \   [RFC3370] MUST be supported.  When key agreement is used, Elliptic\n   Curve\
    \ Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) [RFC6090][RFC5753] MAY be supported.\n   Regardless of\
    \ the key management technique choice, implementations\n   MUST support AES-128\
    \ Key Wrap with Padding [RFC5649] as the content-\n   encryption algorithm.  Implementations\
    \ SHOULD support AES-256 Key\n   Wrap with Padding [RFC5649] as the content-encryption\
    \ algorithm.\n   When key agreement is used, the same key-wrap algorithm MUST\
    \ be used\n   for both key and content encryption.  If the content-encryption\n\
    \   algorithm is AES-128 Key Wrap with Padding, then the key-wrap\n   algorithm\
    \ MUST be AES-128 Key Wrap with Padding [RFC5649].  If the\n   content-encryption\
    \ algorithm is AES-256 Key Wrap with Padding, then\n   the key-wrap algorithm\
    \ MUST be AES-256 Key Wrap with Padding\n   [RFC5649].\n"
- title: 4.  EncryptedData
  contents:
  - "4.  EncryptedData\n   If an implementation supports EncryptedData, then it MUST\
    \ implement\n   AES-128 Key Wrap with Padding [RFC5649] and SHOULD implement AES-256\n\
    \   Key Wrap with Padding [RFC5649].\n   NOTE: EncryptedData requires that keys\
    \ be managed by other means;\n   therefore, the only algorithm specified is the\
    \ content-encryption\n   algorithm.\n"
- title: 5.  AuthEnvelopedData
  contents:
  - "5.  AuthEnvelopedData\n   If an implementation supports AuthEnvelopedData, then\
    \ it MUST\n   implement the EnvelopedData recommendations except for the content-\n\
    \   encryption algorithm, which, in this case, MUST be AES-GCM [RFC5084];\n  \
    \ the 128-bit version MUST be implemented, and the 256-bit version\n   SHOULD\
    \ be implemented.  Implementations MAY also support AES-CCM\n   [RFC5084].\n"
- title: 6.  Public Key Sizes
  contents:
  - "6.  Public Key Sizes\n   The easiest way to implement SignedData, EnvelopedData,\
    \ and\n   AuthEnvelopedData is with public key certificates [RFC5280].  If an\n\
    \   implementation supports RSA, RSASSA-PSS, DSA, RSAES-OAEP, or Diffie-\n   Hellman,\
    \ then it MUST support key lengths from 1024-bit to 2048-bit,\n   inclusive. \
    \ If an implementation supports ECDSA or ECDH, then it MUST\n   support keys on\
    \ P-256.\n"
- title: 7.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "7.  Security Considerations\n   The security considerations from [RFC3370], [RFC3560],\
    \ [RFC4056],\n   [RFC5083], [RFC5084], [RFC5649], [RFC5652], [RFC5753], [RFC5754],\
    \ and\n   [RFC6031] apply.\n   The choice of content-encryption algorithms for\
    \ this document was\n   based on [RFC5649]:\n      In the design of some high\
    \ assurance cryptographic modules, it is\n      desirable to segregate cryptographic\
    \ keying material from other\n      data.  The use of a specific cryptographic\
    \ mechanism solely for\n      the protection of cryptographic keying material\
    \ can assist in this\n      goal.\n   Unfortunately, there is no AES-GCM or AES-CCM\
    \ mode that provides the\n   same properties.  If an AES-GCM and AES-CCM mode\
    \ that provides the\n   same properties is defined, then this document will be\
    \ updated to\n   adopt that algorithm.\n   [SP800-57] provides comparable bits\
    \ of security for some algorithms\n   and key sizes.  [SP800-57] also provides\
    \ time frames during which\n   certain numbers of bits of security are appropriate,\
    \ and some\n   environments may find these time frames useful.\n"
