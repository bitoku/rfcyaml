- title: Abstract
  contents:
  - "Abstract\n   The DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC) requires the use of\n   cryptographic\
    \ algorithm suites for generating digital signatures over\n   DNS data.  There\
    \ is currently an IANA registry for these algorithms,\n   but there is no record\
    \ of the recommended implementation status of\n   each algorithm.  This document\
    \ provides an applicability statement on\n   algorithm implementation status for\
    \ DNSSEC component software.  This\n   document lists each algorithm's status\
    \ based on the current\n   reference.  In the case that an algorithm is specified\
    \ without an\n   implementation status, this document assigns one.  This document\n\
    \   updates RFCs 2536, 2539, 3110, 4034, 4398, 5155, 5702, and 5933.\n"

    \ ([RFC4033],\n   [RFC4034], [RFC4035], [RFC4509], [RFC5155], and [RFC5702]) uses\n\
    \   digital signatures over DNS data to provide source authentication and\n  \
    \ integrity protection.  DNSSEC uses an IANA registry to list codes for\n   digital\
    \ signature algorithms (consisting of a cryptographic algorithm\n   and one-way\
    \ hash function).\n   The original list of algorithm status is found in [RFC4034].\
    \  Other\n   DNSSEC RFCs have added new algorithms or changed the status of\n\
    \   algorithms in the registry.  However, implementers must read through\n   all\
    \ the documents in order to discover which algorithms are\n   considered wise\
    \ to implement, which are not, and which algorithms may\n   become widely used\
    \ in the future.\n   This document defines the current implementation status for\
    \ all\n   registered algorithms.  If the status of algorithms changes, this\n\
    \   document will be replaced with a new one establishing the new status;\n  \
    \ see Section 2.4.\n   This document updates the following: [RFC2536], [RFC2539],\

    \ to interoperate\n      with other implementations of this specification.\n \
    \  Must Not Implement:  The algorithm MUST NOT be implemented.  An\n      algorithm\

    \      there might be occasions where it is reasonable not to implement\n    \

    \ of choosing not to implement this particular\n      algorithm.\n   Optional:\
    \  The algorithm MAY be implemented, but all implementations\n      MUST be prepared\

- title: 2.2.  Algorithm Implementation Status Assignment Rationale
  contents:
  - "2.2.  Algorithm Implementation Status Assignment Rationale\n   RSASHA1 has an\
    \ implementation status of Must Implement, consistent\n   with [RFC4034].  RSAMD5\
    \ has an implementation status of Must Not\n   Implement because of known weaknesses\
    \ in MD5.\n   The status of RSASHA1-NSEC3-SHA1 is set to Recommended to Implement\n\
    \   as many deployments use NSEC3.  The status of RSA/SHA-256 and RSA/\n   SHA-512\
    \ are also set to Recommended to Implement as major deployments\n   (such as the\
    \ root zone) use these algorithms [ROOTDPS].  It is\n   believed that RSA/SHA-256\
    \ or RSA/SHA-512 algorithms will replace\n   older algorithms (e.g., RSA/SHA-1)\
    \ that have a perceived weakness.\n   Likewise, ECDSA with the two identified\
    \ curves (ECDSAP256SHA256 and\n   ECDSAP384SHA384) is an algorithm that may see\
    \ widespread use due to\n   the perceived similar level of security offered with\
    \ smaller key size\n   compared to the key sizes of algorithms such as RSA.  Therefore,\n\
    \   ECDSAP256SHA256 and ECDSAP384SHA384 are Recommended to Implement.\n   All\
    \ other algorithms used in DNSSEC specified without an\n   implementation status\
    \ are currently set to Optional.\n"

    \   [RFC6014] establishes a parallel procedure for adding a registry\n   entry\
    \ for a new algorithm other than a standards track document.\n   Because any algorithm\
    \ not listed in the foregoing table is Optional,\n   algorithms entered into the\
    \ registry using the [RFC6014] procedure\n   are automatically Optional.\n   It\
    \ has turned out to be useful for implementations to refer to a\n   single document\
    \ that specifies the implementation status of every\n   algorithm.  Accordingly,\
    \ when a new algorithm is to be registered\n   with a status other than Optional,\
    \ this document shall be made\n   obsolete by a new document that adds the new\
    \ algorithm to the table\n   in Section 2.3.  Similarly, if the status of any\
    \ algorithm in the\n   table in Section 2.3 changes, a new document shall make\
    \ this document\n   obsolete; that document shall include a replacement of the\
    \ table in\n   Section 2.3.  This way, the goal of having one authoritative document\n\
