  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) provides\
    \ a framework\n   for passing configuration information to hosts on an IP network\n\
    \   [RFC2131].  DHCP is based on the Bootstrap Protocol (BOOTP) [RFC951]\n   adding\
    \ the capability of automatic allocation of reusable network\n   addresses and\
    \ additional configuration options [RFC2131,RFC2132].\n   The DHCP server receives\
    \ a broadcast request from a client.  The DHCP\n   server uses the client interface's\
    \ hardware address to unicast a\n   reply when the client does not yet have an\
    \ IP address assigned to it.\n   The \"chaddr\" field in the DHCP message carries\
    \ the client's hardware\n   address.\n   The \"chaddr\" field is 16 octets in\
    \ length.  The IPoIB link-layer\n   address is 20 octets in length [RFC4391].\
    \  Therefore, the IPoIB\n   link-layer address will not fit in the \"chaddr\"\
    \ field making it\n   impossible for the DHCP server to unicast a reply to the\
    \ client.\n   To ensure interoperability, the usage of the fields and the method\n\
    \   for DHCP interaction must be clarified.  This document describes the\n   IPoIB-specific\
    \ usage of some fields of DHCP.  See [RFC2131] for the\n   mechanism of DHCP and\
    \ the explanations of each field.\n   The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"\
    REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\"\
    , \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n   document are to be interpreted as described\
    \ in [RFC2119].\n"
- title: 2.  The DHCP over IPoIB Mechanism
  contents:
  - "2.  The DHCP over IPoIB Mechanism\n   As described above, the link-layer address\
    \ is unavailable to the DHCP\n   server because the link-layer address is larger\
    \ than the \"chaddr\"\n   field length.  As a result, the server cannot unicast\
    \ its reply to\n   the client.  Therefore, a DHCP client MUST request that the\
    \ server\n   send a broadcast reply by setting the BROADCAST flag when IPoIB\n\
    \   Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) is not possible, i.e., in\n   situations\
    \ where the client does not know its IP address.\n   [RFC1542] discourages the\
    \ use of a broadcast reply.  But in the case\n   of IPoIB, this is a necessity\
    \ because the server does not receive the\n   link-layer address.  To desynchronise\
    \ broadcasts at subnet startup,\n   [RFC2131] suggests that a client wait a random\
    \ time (1 to 10 seconds)\n   before initiating server discovery.  The same timeout\
    \ will spread out\n   the DHCP server broadcast responses generated due to the\
    \ use of the\n   BROADCAST bit.\n   The client hardware address, \"chaddr\", is\
    \ unique in the subnet and\n   hence can be used to identify a client interface.\
    \  But in the absence\n   of a unique \"chaddr\", another unique client identifier\
    \ must be used.\n   The DHCP protocol states that the \"client identifier\" option\
    \ may be\n   used as the unique identifying value for the client [RFC2132].  This\n\
    \   value must be unique within the client's subnet.\n   The \"client identifier\"\
    \ option includes a type and identifier pair.\n   The identifier included in the\
    \ \"client identifier\" option may consist\n   of a hardware address or any other\
    \ unique value such as the DNS name\n   of the client.  When a hardware address\
    \ is used, the type field\n   should be one of the ARP hardware types listed in\
    \ [ARPPARAM].\n"

  contents:
  - "2.1.  IPoIB-specific Usage of DHCP Message Fields\n   A DHCP client, when working\
    \ over an IPoIB interface, MUST follow the\n   following rules:\n    \"htype\"\
    \ (hardware address type) MUST be 32 [ARPPARAM].\n    \"hlen\" (hardware address\
    \ length) MUST be 0.\n    \"chaddr\" (client hardware address) field MUST be zeroed.\n\
    \    \"client-identifier\" option MUST be used in DHCP messages.\n   The \"client\
    \ identifier\" used in DHCP messages MUST conform to\n   [RFC4361].\n"
- title: 2.2.  Use of the BROADCAST flag
  contents:
  - "2.2.  Use of the BROADCAST flag\n   A DHCP client on IPoIB MUST set the BROADCAST\
    \ flag in DHCPDISCOVER\n   and DHCPREQUEST messages (and set \"ciaddr\" to zero)\
    \ to ensure that\n   the server (or the relay agent) broadcasts its reply to the\
    \ client.\n   Note: As described in [RFC2131], \"ciaddr\" MUST be filled in with\
    \ the\n         client's IP address during BOUND, RENEWING or REBINDING states;\n\
    \         therefore, the BROADCAST flag MUST NOT be set.  In these cases,\n  \
    \       the DHCP server unicasts DHCPACK message to the address in\n         \"\
    ciaddr\".  The link address will be resolved by ARP.\n"
