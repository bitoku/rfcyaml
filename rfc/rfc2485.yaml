    \ Technical Standard [2].\n"
- title: Introduction
  contents:
  - "Introduction\n   The Open Group Network Computing Client Technical Standard,\
    \ a product\n   of The Open Group's Network Computing Working Group (NCWG), defines\
    \ a\n   network computing client user authentication facility named the User\n\
    \   Authentication Protocol (UAP).\n   UAP provides two levels of authentication,\
    \ basic and secure.  Basic\n   authentication uses the Basic Authentication mechanism\
    \ defined in the\n   HTTP 1.1 [3] specification.  Secure authentication is simply\
    \ basic\n   authentication encapsulated in an SSLv3 [4] session.\n   In both cases,\
    \ a UAP client needs to obtain the IP address and port\n   of the UAP service.\
    \  Additional path information may be required,\n   depending on the implementation\
    \ of the service.  A URL [5] is an\n   excellent mechanism for encapsulation of\
    \ this information since many\n   UAP servers will be implemented as components\
    \ within legacy HTTP/SSL\n   servers.\n   Most UAP clients have no local state\
    \ and are configured when booted\n   through DHCP.  No existing DHCP option [6]\
    \ has a data field that\n   contains a URL.  Option 72 contains a list of IP addresses\
    \ for WWW\n   servers, but it is not adequate since a port and/or path can not\
    \ be\n   specified.  Hence there is a need for an option that contains a list\n\
    \   of URLs.\n"
- title: User Authentication Protocol Option
  contents:
  - "User Authentication Protocol Option\n   This option specifies a list of URLs,\
    \ each pointing to a user\n   authentication service that is capable of processing\
    \ authentication\n   requests encapsulated in the User Authentication Protocol\
    \ (UAP).  UAP\n   servers can accept either HTTP 1.1 or SSLv3 connections.  If\
    \ the list\n   includes a URL that does not contain a port component, the normal\n\
    \   default port is assumed (i.e., port 80 for http and port 443 for\n   https).\
    \  If the list includes a URL that does not contain a path\n   component, the\
    \ path /uap is assumed.\n   0                   1                   2        \

- title: Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "Security Considerations\n   DHCP currently provides no authentication or security\
    \ mechanisms.\n   Potential exposures to attack are discussed in section 7 of\
    \ the DHCP\n   protocol specification.\n   The User Authentication Protocol does\
    \ not have a means to detect\n   whether or not the client is communicating with\
    \ a rogue\n   authentication service that the client contacted because it received\n\
    \   a forged or otherwise compromised UAP option from a DHCP service\n   whose\
    \ security was compromised.  Even secure authentication does not\n   provide relief\
    \ from this type of attack.  This security exposure is\n   mitigated by the environmental\
    \ assumptions documented in the Network\n   Computing Client Technical Standard.\n"
