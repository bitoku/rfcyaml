  - "1.  Introduction\n   The Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) [RFC4271] is heavily used\
    \ in\n   Service Provider networks for both Internet and BGP/MPLS VPN services\n\
    \   [RFC4364].  For resiliency purposes, redundant routers and BGP\n   sessions\
    \ can be deployed to reduce the consequences of an Autonomous\n   System Border\
    \ Router (ASBR) or BGP session breakdown on customers' or\n   peers' traffic.\n\
    \   We place ourselves in the context where a Service Provider performs a\n  \
    \ maintenance operation and needs to shut down one or multiple BGP\n   peering\
    \ link(s) or a whole ASBR.  If an alternate path is available\n   within the Autonomous\
    \ System (AS), the requirement is to avoid or\n   reduce customer or peer traffic\
    \ loss during the BGP convergence.\n   Indeed, as an alternate path is available\
    \ in the AS, it should be\n   made possible to reroute the customer or peer traffic\
    \ on this backup\n   path before the BGP session(s) is/are torn down, the nominal\
    \ path\n   withdrawn, and the forwarding stopped.\n   The requirements also cover\
    \ the subsequent re-establishment of the\n   BGP session as even this \"UP\" case\
    \ can currently trigger route loss,\n   and thus traffic loss, at some routers.\n\
    \   BGP [RFC4271] and MP-BGP [RFC4760] do not currently have a mechanism\n   to\
    \ gracefully migrate traffic from one BGP next-hop to another\n   without interrupting\
    \ the flow of traffic.  When a BGP session is\n   taken down, BGP behaves as if\
    \ there were a sudden link or router\n   failure and withdraws the prefixes learned\
    \ over that session, which\n   may trigger traffic loss.  While still being advertised\
    \ as reachable,\n   there is no mechanism to advertise to its BGP peers that the\
    \ prefix\n   will soon be unreachable.  When applicable, such mechanism would\n\
    \   reduce or prevent traffic loss.  It would typically be applicable in\n   case\
    \ of a maintenance operation requiring the shutdown of a\n   forwarding resource.\
    \  Typical examples would be a link or line card\n   maintenance, replacement,\
    \ or upgrade.  It may also be applicable for\n   a software upgrade, as it may\
    \ involve a firmware reset on the line\n   cards and hence forwarding interruption.\n\
    \   The introduction of route reflectors (RRs) as per [RFC4456] to solve\n   scalability\
    \ issues bound to Internal BGP (IBGP) full-meshes has\n   worsened the duration\
    \ of routing convergence as some route reflectors\n   may hide the backup path.\
    \  Thus, depending on RR topology, more IBGP\n   hops may be involved in the IBGP\
    \ convergence.\n   Note that these planned maintenance operations cannot be addressed\
    \ by\n   Graceful Restart (GR) extensions [RFC4724] as GR only applies when\n\
    \   the forwarding is preserved during the control plane restart.  On the\n  \
    \ contrary, graceful shutdown applies when the forwarding is\n   interrupted.\n\
    \   Also, note that some protocols are already considering such a\n   graceful\
    \ shutdown procedure (e.g., GMPLS in [RFC5817]).\n   A metric of success is the\
    \ degree to which such a mechanism\n   eliminates traffic loss during maintenance\
    \ operations.\n"

- title: 3.  Problem Statement
  contents:
  - "3.  Problem Statement\n   As per [RFC4271], when one (or many) BGP session(s)\
    \ are shut down, a\n   BGP NOTIFICATION message is sent to the peer and the session\
    \ is then\n   closed.  A protocol convergence is then triggered both by the local\n\
    \   router and by the peer.  Alternate paths to the destination are\n   selected,\
    \ if known.  If those alternate paths are not known prior to\n   the BGP session\
    \ shutdown, additional BGP convergence steps are\n   required in each AS to search\
    \ for an alternate path.\n   This behavior is not satisfactory in a maintenance\
    \ situation because\n   the traffic that was directed towards the removed next-hops\
    \ may be\n   lost until the end of the BGP convergence.  As it is a planned\n\
    \   operation, a make-before-break solution should be made possible.\n   As maintenance\
    \ operations are frequent in large networks [Reliable],\n   the global availability\
    \ of the network is significantly impaired by\n   this BGP maintenance issue.\n"

  contents:
  - "3.1.  Example of Undesirable BGP Routing Behavior\n   To illustrate these problems,\
    \ let us consider the following simple\n   example where one customer router \"\
    CUST\" is dual-attached to two\n   Service Providers' routers, \"ASBR1\" and \"\
    ASBR2\".\n   ASBR1 and ASBR2 are in the same AS and are owned by the same Service\n\
    \   Provider.  Both are IBGP clients of the route reflector R1.\n            \

    \       '\n         Figure 1. Dual-Attached Customer\n   Before the maintenance,\
    \ packets for destination Z/z use the ASBR1-\n   CUST link because R1 selects\
    \ ASBR1's route based on the IGP cost.\n   Let's assume the Service Provider wants\
    \ to shut down the ASBR1-CUST\n   link for maintenance purposes.  Currently, when\
    \ the shutdown is\n   performed on ASBR1, the following steps are performed:\n\
    \      1. ASBR1 withdraws its prefix Z/z to its route reflector, R1.\n      2.\
    \ R1 runs its decision process, selects the route from ASBR2, and\n         advertises\
    \ the new path to ASBR1.\n      3. ASBR1 runs its decision process and recovers\
    \ the reachability\n         of Z/z.\n   Traffic is lost at step 1 when ASBR1\
    \ looses its route until step 3\n   when it discovers a new path.\n   Note that\
    \ this is a simplified description for illustrative purposes.\n   In a bigger\
    \ AS, multiple steps of BGP convergence may be required to\n   find and select\
    \ the best alternate path (e.g., ASBR1 may be chosen\n   based on a higher LOCAL_PREF,\
    \ hierarchical route reflectors may be\n   used, etc.).  When multiple BGP routers\
    \ are involved and plenty of\n   prefixes are affected, the recovery process can\
    \ take longer than\n   application requirements.\n"
- title: 3.2.  Causes of Packet Loss
  contents:
  - "3.2.  Causes of Packet Loss\n   The loss of packets during maintenance has two\
    \ main causes:\n      - lack of an alternate path on some routers, and\n     \
    \ - transient routing inconsistency.\n   Some routers may lack an alternate path\
    \ because another router is\n   hiding the backup path.  This router can be:\n\
    \      - a route reflector only propagating its best path.\n      - the backup\
    \ ASBR not advertising the backup path because it\n        prefers the nominal\
    \ path.\n   This lack of knowledge regarding the alternate path is the first\n\
    \   target of this requirements document.\n   Transient routing inconsistencies\
    \ happen during IBGP convergence\n   because routers do not simultaneously update\
    \ their Routing\n   Information Bases (RIBs) and hence do not simultaneously update\
    \ their\n   Forwarding Information Bases (FIBs) entries.  This can lead to\n \
    \  forwarding loops, which result in both link congestion and packet\n   drops.\
    \  The duration of these transient micro-loops is dependent on\n   the IBGP topology\
    \ (e.g., number of route reflectors between ingress\n   and egress ASBR), implementation\
    \ differences among router platforms\n   (which result in differences in the time\
    \ taken to update specific\n   prefix in the FIB), and forwarding mode (hop-by-hop\
    \ IP forwarding\n   versus tunneling).\n   Note that when an IP lookup is only\
    \ performed on entry to the AS, for\n   example, prior to entry into a tunnel\
    \ across the AS, micro-loops will\n   not occur.  An example of this is when BGP\
    \ is being used as the\n   routing protocol for MPLS VPN as defined in [RFC4364].\n\
    \   Note that [RFC5715] defines a framework for loop-free convergence.\n   It\
    \ has been written in the context of IP fast reroute for link state\n   IGP [RFC5714],\
    \ but some concepts are also of interest for BGP\n   convergence.\n"

- title: 5.  Goals and Requirements
  contents:
  - "5.  Goals and Requirements\n   Currently, when a BGP session of the router under\
    \ maintenance is shut\n   down, the router removes the routes and then triggers\
    \ the BGP\n   convergence on its BGP peers by withdrawing its route.\n   The goal\
    \ of BGP graceful shutdown of a (set of) BGP session(s) is to\n   minimize traffic\
    \ loss during a planned shutdown.  Ideally, a solution\n   should reduce this\
    \ traffic loss to zero.\n   Another goal is to minimize and, preferably, to eliminate\
    \ packet loss\n   when the BGP session is re-established following the maintenance.\n\
    \   As the event is known in advance, a make-before-break solution can be\n  \
    \ used in order to initiate the BGP convergence, find and install the\n   alternate\
    \ paths before the nominal paths are removed.  As a result,\n   before the nominal\
    \ BGP session is shut down, all affected routers\n   learn and use the alternate\
    \ paths.  Those alternate paths are\n   computed by BGP, taking into account the\
    \ known status of the network,\n   which includes known failures that the network\
    \ is processing\n   concurrently with the BGP session graceful shutdown and possibly\n\
    \   other known graceful shutdowns under way.  Therefore, multiple BGP\n   graceful\
    \ shutdowns overlapping within a short time frame are\n   gracefully handled.\
    \  Indeed, a given graceful shutdown takes into\n   account all previous ones.\n\
    \   As a result, provided an alternate path with enough remaining\n   capacity\
    \ is available, the packets are rerouted before the BGP\n   session termination\
    \ and fewer packets (possibly none) are lost during\n   the BGP convergence process\
    \ since, at any time, all routers have a\n   valid path.\n   From the above goals,\
    \ we can derive the following requirements:\n   a)   A mechanism to advertise\
    \ the maintenance action to all affected\n        routers is REQUIRED.  Such a\
    \ mechanism may be either implicit or\n        explicit.  Note that affected routers\
    \ can be located both in the\n        local AS and in neighboring ASes.  Note\
    \ also that the\n        maintenance action can either be the shutdown of a BGP\
    \ session\n        or the establishment of a BGP session.\n        The mechanism\
    \ SHOULD allow BGP routers to minimize and,\n        preferably, eliminate packet\
    \ loss when a path is removed or\n        advertised.  In particular, it SHOULD\
    \ be ensured that the old\n        path is not removed from the routing tables\
    \ of the affected\n        routers before the new path is known.\n        The\
    \ solution mechanism MUST significantly reduce and, ideally,\n        eliminate\
    \ packet loss.  A trade-off may be made between the\n        degree of packet\
    \ loss and the simplicity of the solution.\n   b)   An Internet-wide convergence\
    \ is OPTIONAL.  However, if the\n        initiator AS and the neighbor AS(es)\
    \ have a backup path, they\n        SHOULD be able to gracefully converge before\
    \ the nominal path is\n        shut down.\n   c)   The proposed solution SHOULD\
    \ be applicable to any kind of BGP\n        sessions (External BGP (EBGP), IBGP,\
    \ IBGP route reflector\n        client, EBGP confederations, EBGP multi hop, MultiProtocol\
    \ BGP\n        extension, etc.) and any address family.  If a BGP\n        implementation\
    \ allows the closing or enabling of a subset of\n        Address Family Identifiers\
    \ (AFIs) carried in an MP-BGP session,\n        this mechanism MAY be applicable\
    \ to this subset of AFIs.\n        Depending on the kind of session, there may\
    \ be some variations\n        in the proposed solution in order to fulfill the\
    \ requirements.\n        The following cases should be handled in priority:\n\
    \        - The shutdown of an inter-AS link and therefore the shutdown of\n  \
    \        an EBGP session;\n        - The shutdown of an ASBR and therefore the\
    \ shutdown of all its\n          BGP sessions.\n        Service Providers and\
    \ platforms implementing a graceful shutdown\n        solution should note that\
    \ in BGP/MPLS VPN as per [RFC4364], the\n        Provider Edge - Customer Edge\
    \ (PE-CE) routing can be performed\n        by protocols other than BGP (e.g.,\
    \ static routes, RIPv2, OSPF,\n        IS-IS).  This is out of scope of this document.\n\
    \   d)   The proposed solution SHOULD NOT change the BGP convergence\n       \
    \ behavior for the ASes exterior to the maintenance process,\n        namely,\
    \ ASes other than the initiator AS and its neighbor\n        AS(es).\n   e)  \
    \ An incremental deployment on a per-AS or per-BGP session basis\n        MUST\
    \ be made possible.  In case of partial deployment, the\n        proposed solution\
    \ SHOULD incrementally improve the maintenance\n        process.  It should be\
    \ noted that in an inter-domain relation,\n        one AS may have more incentive\
    \ to use graceful shutdown than the\n        other.  Similarly, in a BGP/MPLS\
    \ VPN environment, it's much\n        easier to upgrade the PE routers than the\
    \ CE ones, mainly\n        because there is at least an order of magnitude more\
    \ CE and CE\n        locations than PE and PE locations.  As a consequence, when\n\
    \        splitting the cost of the solution between the g-shut initiator\n   \
    \     and the g-shut neighbor, the solution SHOULD favor a low-cost\n        solution\
    \ on the neighbor AS side in order to reduce the impact\n        on the g-shut\
    \ neighbor.  Impact should be understood as a\n        generic term that includes\
    \ first hardware, then software, then\n        configuration upgrade.\n   f) \
    \  Redistribution or advertisement of (static) IP routes into BGP\n        SHOULD\
    \ also be covered.\n   g)   The proposed solution MAY be designed in order to\
    \ avoid\n        transient forwarding loops.  Indeed, forwarding loops increase\n\
    \        packet transit-delay and may lead to link saturation.\n   h)   The specific\
    \ procedure SHOULD end when the BGP session is closed\n        following the g-shut\
    \ and once the BGP session is gracefully\n        opened following the g-noshut.\
    \  In the end, once the planned\n        maintenance is finished, the nominal\
    \ BGP routing MUST be re-\n        established.  The duration of the g-shut procedure,\
    \ and hence\n        the time before the BGP session is safely closed, SHOULD\
    \ be\n        discussed by the solution document.  Examples of possible\n    \
    \    solutions are the use of a pre-configured timer, the use of a\n        message\
    \ to signal the end of the BGP convergence, or the\n        monitoring of the\
    \ traffic on the g-shut interface.\n   i)   The solution SHOULD be simple and\
    \ simple to operate.  Hence, it\n        MAY only cover a subset of the cases.\
    \  As a consequence, most of\n        the above requirements are expressed as\
    \ \"SHOULD\" rather than\n        \"MUST\".\n        The metrics to evaluate and\
    \ compare the proposed solutions are:\n        - The duration of the remaining\
    \ loss of connectivity when the\n          BGP session is brought down or up;\n\
    \        - The applicability to a wide range of BGP and network\n          topologies;\n\
    \        - The simplicity;\n        - The duration of transient forwarding loops;\n\
    \        - The additional load introduced in BGP (e.g., BGP messages sent\n  \
    \        to peer routers, peer ASes, the Internet).\n"
