  - "1. The Network Management Framework\n   The Internet-standard Network Management
    Framework consists of three\n   components.  They are:\n      STD 16/RFC 1155
    which defines the SMI, the mechanisms used for\n         describing and naming
    objects for the purpose of management.\n      STD 16/RFC 1212 defines a more concise
    description mechanism,\n         which is wholly consistent with the SMI.\n      RFC
    1156 which defines MIB-I, the core set of managed objects for\n         the Internet
    suite of protocols.  STD 17/RFC 1213 defines MIB-\n         II, an evolution of
    MIB-I based on implementation experience\n         and new operational requirements.\n
    \     STD 15/RFC 1157 which defines the SNMP, the protocol used for\n         network
    access to managed objects.\n   The Framework permits new objects to be defined
    for the purpose of\n   experimentation and evaluation.\n"
  title: 1. The Network Management Framework
- contents:
  - "2. Objects\n   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store,
    termed\n   the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are\n   defined
    using the subset of Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1) [7]\n   defined in the
    SMI.  In particular, each object has a name, a syntax,\n   and an encoding.  The
    name is an object identifier, an\n   administratively assigned name, which specifies
    an object type.  The\n   object type together with an object instance serves to
    uniquely\n   identify a specific instantiation of the object.  For human\n   convenience,
    we often use a textual string, termed the OBJECT\n   DESCRIPTOR, to also refer
    to the object type.\n   The syntax of an object type defines the abstract data
    structure\n   corresponding to that object type.  The ASN.1 language is used for\n
    \  this purpose.  However, the SMI [3] purposely restricts the ASN.1\n   constructs
    which may be used.  These restrictions are explicitly made\n   for simplicity.\n
    \  The encoding of an object type is simply how that object type is\n   represented
    using the object type's syntax.  Implicitly tied to the\n   notion of an object
    type's syntax and encoding is how the object type\n   is represented when being
    transmitted on the network.\n   The SMI specifies the use of the basic encoding
    rules of ASN.1 [8],\n   subject to the additional requirements imposed by the
    SNMP.\n"
  title: 2. Objects
- contents:
  - "2.1 Format of Definitions\n   Section 4 contains the specification of all object
    types contained in\n   this MIB module.  The object types are defined using the
    conventions\n   defined in the SMI, as amended by the extensions specified in
    [9].\n"

  title: 3. Overview
- contents:
  - "3.1 Textual Conventions\n   Several new data types are introduced as a textual
    convention in this\n   MIB document.  These textual conventions enhance the readability
    of\n   the specification and can ease comparison with other specifications\n   if
    appropriate.  It should be noted that the introduction of the\n   these textual
    conventions has no effect on either the syntax nor the\n   semantics of any managed
    objects.  The use of these is merely an\n   artifact of the explanatory method
    used.  Objects defined in terms of\n   one of these methods are always encoded
    by means of the rules that\n   define the primitive type.  Hence, no changes to
    the SMI or the SNMP\n   are necessary to accommodate these textual conventions
    which are\n   adopted merely for the convenience of readers and writers in pursuit\n
    \  of the elusive goal of clear, concise, and unambiguous MIB documents.\n   The
    new data type is RouteTag. The RouteTag type represents the\n   contents of the
    Route Domain field in the packet header or route\n   entry.\n"
  title: 3.1 Textual Conventions
- contents:
  - "3.2 Structure of MIB\n   The RIP-2 MIB contains global counters, useful for detecting
    the\n   deleterious effects of RIP incompatibilities; two \"interfaces\"\n   tables,
    which contains interface-specific statistics and\n   configuration information;
    and an optional \"peer\" table, containing\n   information that may be helpful
    in debugging neighbor relationships.\n   Like the protocol itself, this MIB takes
    great care to preserve\n   compatibility with RIP-1 systems and controls for monitoring
    and\n   controlling system interactions.\n"
  title: 3.2 Structure of MIB
- contents:
  - "3.3 Modifications from RFC 1389\n   The RIP-2 MIB was originally published in
    RFC 1389.  It encoded the\n   concept of a Routing Domain, and did not address
    unnumbered\n   interfaces.\n   In the current version of the protocol, Route Domains
    are deprecated;\n   therefore, they are deprecated in the MIB as well.  This means
    that\n   the object rip2IfConfDomain is deprecated, and the object\n   rip2PeerDomain
    (which cannot be deprecated, being an instance object)\n   must always be zero.\n
    \  Unnumbered interfaces are supported in this version.  Since the IP\n   Address
    that the neighbor uses may be unknown to the system, a\n   pseudo-address is used
    to identify these interfaces.  The pseudo-\n   address is in the class A network
    0.0.0.0, and the host number (the\n   least significant 24 bits of the address)
    are the ifIndex value of\n   the relevant IP Interface.  This is an additional
    new meaning of the\n   objects rip2IfStatAddress and rip2IfConfAddress, backward
    compatible\n   with the RFC 1389 usage.  The object rip2IfConfSrcAddress is added,\n
    \  to permit the configuration of the source address on an unnumbered\n   interface,
    and the meaning of the object rip2PeerAddress is broadened\n   to remain relevant
    on unnumbered interfaces.\n   rip2IfConfSend is augmented with two values for
    the use of Demand RIP\n   under RIP-I and RIP-II rules.  This avoids the necessity
    of a Demand\n   RIP MIB.\n   MD5 Authentication is supported.\n"
