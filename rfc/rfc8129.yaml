  - "Abstract\n   This document updates RFC 4120, as it specifies an extension in\
    \ the\n   Kerberos protocol.  It defines a new authorization data type,\n   AD-AUTHENTICATION-INDICATOR.\
    \  The purpose of introducing this data\n   type is to include an indicator of\
    \ the strength of a client's\n   authentication in service tickets so that application\
    \ services can\n   use it as an input into policy decisions.\n"

- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   Kerberos [RFC4120] allows secure interaction among users\
    \ and services\n   over a network.  It supports a variety of authentication mechanisms\n\
    \   using its pre-authentication framework [RFC6113].  The Kerberos\n   authentication\
    \ service has been architected to support password-based\n   authentication as\
    \ well as multi-factor authentication using one-time\n   password devices, public-key\
    \ cryptography, and other\n   pre-authentication schemes.  Implementations that\
    \ offer\n   pre-authentication mechanisms supporting significantly different\n\
    \   strengths of client authentication may choose to keep track of the\n   strength\
    \ of the authentication that was used, for use as an input\n   into policy decisions.\n\
    \   This document specifies a new authorization data type to convey\n   authentication\
    \ strength information to application services.\n   Elements of this type appear\
    \ within an AD-CAMMAC (Authorization Data\n   type Container Authenticated by\
    \ Multiple Message Authentication\n   Codes) [RFC7751] container.\n"

    \ in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].\n"
- title: 3.  AD Type Specification
  contents:
  - "3.  AD Type Specification\n   The Key Distribution Center (KDC) MAY include authorization\
    \ data of\n   ad-type 97, wrapped in AD-CAMMAC, in initial credentials.  The KDC\n\
    \   MAY copy it from a ticket-granting ticket into service tickets.\n   The corresponding\
    \ ad-data field contains the DER encoding [X.690] of\n   the following ASN.1 [X.680]\
    \ type:\n   AD-AUTHENTICATION-INDICATOR ::= SEQUENCE OF UTF8String\n   Each UTF8String\
    \ value is a short string that indicates that a\n   particular set of requirements\
    \ was met during the initial\n   authentication.  These strings are intended to\
    \ be compared against\n   known values.  They are not intended to store structured\
    \ data.  Each\n   string MUST be either:\n   o  A URI that references a Level\
    \ of Assurance Profile [RFC6711], or\n   o  A site-defined string, which MUST\
    \ NOT contain a colon, whose\n      meaning is determined by the realm administrator.\n\
    \   Authorization data elements of type AD-AUTHENTICATION-INDICATOR MUST\n   be\
    \ included in an AD-CAMMAC container so that their contents can be\n   verified\
    \ as originating from the KDC.  Elements of type\n   AD-AUTHENTICATION-INDICATOR\
    \ MAY safely be ignored by applications and\n   KDCs that do not implement this\
    \ element.\n"
- title: 4.  Assigned Numbers
  contents:
  - "4.  Assigned Numbers\n   RFC 4120 [RFC4120] is updated in the following way:\n\
    \   o  The ad-type number 97 is assigned for AD-AUTHENTICATION-INDICATOR,\n  \
    \    updating the table in Section 7.5.4 of RFC 4120 [RFC4120].\n   o  The table\
    \ in Section 5.2.6 of RFC 4120 [RFC4120] is updated to map\n      the ad-type\
    \ 97 to \"DER encoding of AD-AUTHENTICATION-INDICATOR\".\n"
- title: 5.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "5.  Security Considerations\n   Elements of type AD-AUTHENTICATION-INDICATOR\
    \ are wrapped in AD-CAMMAC\n   containers.  AD-CAMMAC supersedes AD-KDC-ISSUED\
    \ and allows both\n   application services and the KDC to verify the authenticity\
    \ of the\n   contained authorization data.\n   KDC implementations MUST use AD-CAMMAC\
    \ verifiers as described in the\n   security considerations of RFC 7751 [RFC7751]\
    \ to ensure that\n   AD-AUTHENTICATION-INDICATOR elements are not modified by\
    \ an attacker.\n   Application servers MUST validate the AD-CAMMAC container before\n\
    \   making authorization decisions based on AD-AUTHENTICATION-INDICATOR\n   elements.\
    \  Application servers MUST NOT make authorization decisions\n   based on AD-AUTHENTICATION-INDICATOR\
    \ elements that appear outside of\n   AD-CAMMAC containers.\n   Using multiple\
    \ strings in AD-AUTHENTICATION-INDICATOR may lead to\n   ambiguity when a service\
    \ tries to make a decision based on the\n   AD-AUTHENTICATION-INDICATOR values.\
    \  This ambiguity can be avoided if\n   indicator values are always used as a\
    \ positive indication of certain\n   requirements being met during the initial\
    \ authentication.  For\n   example, if a \"without-password\" indicator is inserted\
    \ whenever\n   authentication occurs without a password, a service might assume\
    \ this\n   is an indication that a higher-strength client authentication\n   occurred.\
    \  However, this indicator might also be inserted when no\n   authentication occurred\
    \ at all (such as anonymous PKINIT).\n   Application service evaluation of site-defined\
    \ indicators MUST\n   consider the realm of original authentication in order to\
    \ avoid\n   cross-realm indicator collisions.  Failure to enforce this property\n\
    \   can result in invalid authorization decisions.\n"
