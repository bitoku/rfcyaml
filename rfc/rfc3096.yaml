  - "Abstract\n   This document contains requirements for robust IP/UDP/RTP (Internet\n\
    \   Protocol/User Datagram Protocol/Real-Time Transport Protocol) header\n   compression\
    \ to be developed by the ROHC (Robust Header Compression)\n   WG.  It is based\
    \ on the ROHC charter, discussions in the WG, the 3GPP\n   document \"3GPP TR\
    \ 23.922\", version 1.0.0 of October 1999, as well as\n   contributions from 3G.IP.\n"
- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   The goal of the ROHC WG is to develop header compression\
    \ schemes that\n   perform well over links with high error rates and long link\
    \ round\n   trip times.  The schemes must perform well for cellular links built\n\
    \   using technologies such as WCDMA, EDGE, and CDMA-2000.  However, the\n   schemes\
    \ should also be applicable to other future link technologies\n   with high loss\
    \ and long round trip times.\n   The following requirements have, more or less\
    \ arbitrarily, been\n   divided into three groups.  The first group deals with\
    \ requirements\n   concerning the impact of an header compression scheme on the\
    \ rest of\n   the Internet infrastructure.  The second group concerns what kind\
    \ of\n   headers that must be compressed efficiently.  The final group\n   concerns\
    \ efficiency requirements and requirements which stem from the\n   properties\
    \ of the anticipated link technologies.\n"
- title: 2. Header compression requirements
  contents:
  - "2. Header compression requirements\n   Several current standardization efforts\
    \ in the cellular arena aim at\n   supporting voice over IP and other real-time\
    \ services over IP, e.g.,\n   GERAN (specified by the ETSI SMG2 standards group),\
    \ and UTRAN\n   (specified by the 3GPP standards organization).  It is critical\
    \ for\n   these standardization efforts that a suitable header compression\n \
    \  scheme is developed before completion of the Release 2000 standards.\n   Therefore,\
    \ it is imperative that the ROHC WG keeps its schedule.\n"
- title: 2.1 Impact on Internet infrastructure
  contents:
  - "2.1 Impact on Internet infrastructure\n   1. Transparency: When a header is compressed\
    \ and then decompressed,\n   the resulting header must be semantically identical\
    \ to the original\n   header.  If this cannot be achieved, the packet containing\
    \ the\n   erroneous header must be discarded.\n   Justification: The header compression\
    \ process must not produce\n   headers that might cause problems for any current\
    \ or future part of\n   the Internet infrastructure.\n   2. Ubiquity: Must not\
    \ require modifications to existing IP (v4 or\n   v6), UDP, or RTP implementations.\n\
    \   Justification: Ease of deployment.\n   Note: The ROHC WG may recommend changes\
    \ that would increase the\n   compression efficiency for the RTP streams emitted\
    \ by\n   implementations.  However, ROHC cannot rely on such recommendations\n\
    \   being followed.\n"
- title: 2.2 Supported headers and kinds of RTP streams
  contents:
  - "2.2 Supported headers and kinds of RTP streams\n   1. IPv4 and IPv6: Must support\
    \ both IPv4 and IPv6.\n   Justification: IPv4 and IPv6 will both be around during\
    \ the\n   foreseeable future.\n   2. Mobile IP: The kinds of headers used by Mobile\
    \ IP{v4,v6} should be\n   compressed efficiently.  For IPv4 these include headers\
    \ of tunneled\n   packets.  For IPv6 these include headers containing the Routing\n\
    \   Header, the Binding Update Destination Option, and the Home Address\n   option.\n\
    \   Justification: It is very likely that Mobile IP will be used by\n   cellular\
    \ devices.\n   3. Genericity: Must support compression of headers of arbitrary\
    \ RTP\n   streams.\n   Justification: There must be a generic scheme which can\
    \ compress\n   reasonably well for any payload type and traffic pattern.  This\
    \ does\n   not preclude optimizations for certain media types where the traffic\n\
    \   pattern is known, e.g., for low-bandwidth voice and low-bandwidth\n   video.\n\
    \   Note: This applies to the RTP stream before as well as after it has\n   passed\
    \ through an internet.\n   4. IPSEC: ROHC should be able to compress headers containing\
    \ IPSEC\n   subheaders.\n   Note: It is of course not possible to compress the\
    \ encrypted part of\n   an ESP header, nor the cryptographic data in an AH header.\n"
- title: 2.3 Efficiency
  contents:
  - "2.3 Efficiency\n   1. Performance/Spectral Efficiency: Must provide low relative\n\
    \   overhead under expected operating conditions; compression efficiency\n   should\
    \ be better than for RFC 2508 under equivalent operating\n   conditions.  The\
    \ error rate should only marginally increase the\n   overhead under expected operating\
    \ conditions.\n   Justification: Spectrum efficiency is a primary goal.  RFC 2508\
    \ does\n   not perform well enough.\n   Note: The relative overhead is the average\
    \ header overhead relative\n   to the payload.  Any auxiliary (e.g., control or\
    \ feedback) channels\n   used by the scheme should be taken into account when\
    \ calculating the\n   header overhead.\n   2. Error propagation: Error propagation\
    \ due to header compression\n   should be kept at an absolute minimum.  Error\
    \ propagation is defined\n   as the loss or damage of headers subsequent to headers\
    \ lost or\n   damaged by the link, even if those subsequent headers are not lost\
    \ or\n   damaged.\n   Justification: Error propagation reduces spectral efficiency\
    \ and\n   reduces quality.  CRTP suffers severely from error propagation.\n  \
    \ Note: There are at least two kinds of error propagation; loss\n   propagation,\
    \ where an error causes subsequent headers to be lost, and\n   damage propagation,\
    \ where an error causes subsequent headers to be\n   damaged.\n   3a. Handover\
    \ loss events: There must be a way to run ROHC where loss\n   events of length\
    \ 150 milliseconds are handled efficiently and where\n   loss or damage propagation\
    \ is not introduced by ROHC during such\n   events.\n   Justification: Such loss\
    \ events can be introduced by handover\n   operations in a (radio) network between\
    \ compressor and decompressor.\n   Handover operations can be frequent in cellular\
    \ systems.  Failure to\n   handle handover well can adversely impact spectrum\
    \ efficiency and\n   quality.\n   3b. Handover context recreation: There must\
    \ be a way to run ROHC that\n   deals well with events where the route of an RTP\
    \ conversation changes\n   such that either the compressor or the decompressor\
    \ of the\n   conversation is relocated to another node, where the context needs\
    \ to\n   be recreated.  ROHC must not introduce erroneous headers during such\n\
    \   events, and should not introduce packet loss during such events.\n   Justification:\
    \ Such events can be frequent in cellular systems where\n   the compressor/decompressor\
    \ on the network side is close to the radio\n   base stations.\n   Note: In order\
    \ to aid developers of context recreation schemes where\n   context is transfered\
    \ to the new node, the specification shall\n   outline what parts of the context\
    \ is to be transfered, as well as\n   conditions for its use.  Procedures for\
    \ context recreation (and\n   discard) without such context transfer will also\
    \ be provided.\n   4. Link delay: Must operate under all expected link delay conditions.\n\
    \   5. Processing delay: The scheme must not contribute significantly to\n   system\
    \ delay budget.\n   6. Multiple links: The scheme must perform well when there\
    \ are two or\n   more cellular links in the end-to-end path.\n   Justification:\
    \ Such paths will occur.\n   Note: loss on previous links will cause irregularities\
    \ in the RTP\n   stream reaching the compressor.  Such irregularities should only\n\
    \   marginally affect performance.\n   7a. Packet Misordering: The scheme should\
    \ be able to compress when\n   there are misordered packets in the RTP stream\
    \ reaching the\n   compressor.  No misordering is expected on the link between\n\
    \   compressor and decompressor.\n   Justification: Misordering happens regularly\
    \ in the Internet.\n   However, since the Internet is engineered to run TCP reasonably\
    \ well,\n   excessive misordering will not be common and need not be handled with\n\
    \   optimum efficiently.\n   7b. Moderate Packet Misordering: The scheme should\
    \ efficiently handle\n   moderate misordering (2-3 packets) in the packet stream\
    \ reaching the\n   compressor.\n   Note: This kind of reordering is common.\n\
    \   8. Unidirectional links/multicast: Must operate (possibly with less\n   efficiency)\
    \ over links where there is no feedback channel or where\n   there are several\
    \ receivers.\n   9. Configurable frame size fluctuation: It should be possible\
    \ to\n   restrict the number of different frame sizes used by the scheme.\n  \
    \ Justification: Some radio technologies support only a limited number\n   of\
    \ frame sizes efficiently.\n   Note: Somewhat degraded performance is to be expected\
    \ when such\n   restrictions are applied.\n   Note: This implies that a list of\
    \ \"good\" frame sizes must be made\n   available and that ROHC may pick a suitable\
    \ header format to utilize\n   available space as well as possible.\n   10. Delay:\
    \ ROHC should not noticeably add to the end-to-end delay.\n   Justification: RTP\
    \ packets carrying data for interactive voice or\n   video have a limited end-to-end\
    \ delay budget.\n   Note: This requirement is intended to prevent schemes that\
    \ achieve\n   robustness at the expense of delay, for example schemes that require\n\
    \   that header i+x, x>0, is received before header i can be\n   decompressed.\n\
    \   Note: Together with 2.3.5, this requirement implies that ROHC will\n   not\
    \ noticeably add to the jitter of the RTP stream, other than what\n   is caused\
    \ by variations in header size.\n   Note: This requirement does not prevent a\
    \ queue from forming upstream\n   a bottleneck link.  Nor does it prevent a compressor\
    \ from utilizing\n   information from more than one header in such a queue.\n\
    \   11. Residual errors: For a residual bit-error rate of at most 1e-5,\n   the\
    \ ROHC scheme must not increase the error rate.\n   Justification: Some target\
    \ links have a residual error rate, i.e,\n   rate of undetected errors, of this\
    \ magnitude.\n   Note: In the presence of residual bit-errors, ROHC will need\
    \ error\n   detection mechanisms to prevent damage propagation.  These mechanisms\n\
    \   will catch some residual errors, but those not caught might cause\n   damage\
    \ propagation.  This requirement states that the reduction of\n   the damage rate\
    \ due to the error detection mechanisms must not be\n   less than the increase\
    \ in error rate due to damage propagation.\n"
