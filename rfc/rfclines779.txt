SEND LOCATION TELNET SEND LOCATION Option 4.
Many network sites now provide a listing of the users currently logged in giving their names and locations (see the NAME/FINGER protocol, RFC 742).
The location is useful for physically locating the user if he or she is nearby, or for calling them (a nearby phone number is often included).
However, for users logged in via the network, the location printed is often no more than the originating site name.
This TELNET option allows the user's TELNET program to send the user's location to the server TELNET so that it can be displayed in addition to the site name.
This functionality is already present in the SUPDUP protocol (RFC 734).
When the user TELNET program knows the user's location, it should offer to transmit this information to the server TELNET by sending IAC WILL SEND LOCATION.
If the server's system is able to make use of this information (as can the ITS sites), then the server will reply with IAC DO SEND LOCATION.
The user TELNET is then free to send the location in a subnegotiation at any time.
