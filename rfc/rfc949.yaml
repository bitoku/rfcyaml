  - "STATUS OF THIS MEMO\n   This RFC proposes an extension to the File Transfer Protocol\
    \ for the\n   ARPA-Internet community, and requests discussion and suggestions\
    \ for\n   improvements.  Distribution of this memo is unlimited.\n"
- title: DISCUSSION
  contents:
  - "DISCUSSION\n   There are various contexts in which it would be desirable to have\
    \ an\n   FTP command that had the effect of the present STOR but rather than\n\
    \   requiring the sender to specify a file name instead caused the\n   resultant\
    \ file to have a unique name relative to the current\n   directory.  This would\
    \ be useful for all sorts of \"pool\" directories;\n   the directories that serve\
    \ as queues for printer daemons come\n   immediately to mind (so do fax and even\
    \ cardpunch daemons' queues),\n   although naturally the sort of printer queue\
    \ that a local command has\n   to manage the interface to isn't what's meant by\
    \ \"pool\" in this\n   context.\n   If we accept the need for such an FTP extension,\
    \ and that it should\n   not be done with an \"X\" command because it needs to\
    \ be relied on\n   \"everywhere,\" the interesting question then becomes how to\
    \ mechanize\n   it.  Probably the most natural way to do it would be either to\
    \ add a\n   \"control argument\" of -UNM to the syntax of STOR, now that there\
    \ are\n   enough UNIXtm's around so that this good old Multics trick isn't\n \
    \  alien any more, or even to declare that STOR with no argument should\n   cause\
    \ a directory-unique name to be generated.  However, either of\n   these would\
    \ necessitate \"reopening\" the STOR command code, which is a\n   distasteful\
    \ sort of exercise.  Since most FTP's presumably do a\n   dispatch sort of thing\
    \ off a list of command names to begin with,\n   then, an additional command would\
    \ seem to be the way to go.\n   Naming the command calls for a bit of thought.\
    \  STore Uniquely Named\n   (-> STUN) is silly; UNIQue comes to close to free\
    \ advertising or even\n   trademark infringement (and confuses fingers if you're\
    \ typing); Store\n   Uniquely NaMed (-> SUNM) doesn't avoid free advertising either;\n\
    \   Uniquely Named STore (-> UNST) might look like a synonym for DELEte,\n   though\
    \ it's not all that bad; SToRe Uniquely named (-> STRU) is\n   taken; and so it\
    \ goes.  The best bet seems to be STOU.\n   Of somewhat more practical import,\
    \ there's also the question of\n   whether the sender needs to be apprised of\
    \ what the unique name\n   turned out to be.  Intuitively, sometimes this would\
    \ be the case and\n   sometimes it wouldn't.  Making it optional is almost certainly\
    \ too\n"

- title: FTP Unique-Named Store Command
  contents:
  - "FTP Unique-Named Store Command\n   much like work, though--even if it does have\
    \ the subtle virtue of\n   finally getting control arguments into FTP.  Therefore,\
    \ why not just\n   include it in a suitable response-code's free text field (unless,\
    \ of\n   course, an avalanche of comments comes in urging it not be done at\n\
    \   all)?\n   Note, by the way, that the intent here is emphatically not to\n\
    \   sidestep whatever access control, authentication, and accounting\n   mechanisms\
    \ Hosts might have in play before the user can do an old\n   STOR or a new STOU,\
    \ but with suitable publicized ID's and passwords\n   it could be almost as good\
    \ as the proposal made in RFC 505.\n"
- title: RECOMMENDATION
  contents:
  - "RECOMMENDATION\n   Add a new command, STOU, to FTP, which behaves like STOR except\
    \ that\n   the resultant file is to be created in the current directory under\
    \ a\n   name unique to that directory.   The 250 Transfer Started response\n \
    \  should include the name generated (unless the copy of FTP I have is\n   so\
    \ old that 250 isn't the right number any more).\n"
