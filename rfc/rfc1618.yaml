- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   PPP was designed as a standard method of communicating over\
    \ point-\n   to-point links.  Initial deployment has been over short local lines,\n\
    \   leased lines, and plain-old-telephone-service (POTS) using modems.\n   As\
    \ new packet services and higher speed lines are introduced, PPP is\n   easily\
    \ deployed in these environments as well.\n   This specification is primarily\
    \ concerned with the use of the PPP\n   encapsulation over ISDN links.  Since\
    \ the ISDN B-channel is by\n   definition a point-to-point circuit, PPP is well\
    \ suited to use over\n   these links.\n   The ISDN Primary Rate Interface (PRI)\
    \ may support many concurrent B-\n   channel links.  The PPP LCP and NCP mechanisms\
    \ are particularly\n   useful in this situation in reducing or eliminating hand\n\
    \   configuration, and facilitating ease of communication between diverse\n  \
    \ implementations.\n   The ISDN D-channel can also be used for sending PPP packets\
    \ when\n   suitably framed, but is limited in bandwidth and often restricts\n\
    \   communication links to a local switch.\n   The terminology of ISDN can be\
    \ confusing.  Here is a simple graphical\n   representation of the points used\
    \ in subsequent descriptions:\n                   +-------+     +-------+    \
    \ +-------+\n               R   |       |  S  |       |  T  |       |   U\n  \

    \     +-------+\n   These elements are frequently combined into a single device.\n"
- title: 2.  Physical Layer Requirements
  contents:
  - "2.  Physical Layer Requirements\n   PPP treats ISDN channels as bit or octet\
    \ oriented synchronous links.\n   These links MUST be full-duplex, but MAY be\
    \ either dedicated or\n   circuit-switched.\n   Interface Format\n      PPP presents\
    \ an octet interface to the physical layer.  There is\n      no provision for\
    \ sub-octets to be supplied or accepted.  The octet\n      stream is applied primarily\
    \ at the R or T reference points.\n   Transmission Rate\n      PPP does not impose\
    \ any restrictions regarding transmission rate,\n      other than that of the\
    \ particular ISDN channel interface.\n   Control Signals\n      PPP does not require\
    \ the use of control signals.  When available,\n      using such signals can allow\
    \ greater functionality and\n      performance.  Implications are discussed in\
    \ [2].\n      Control signals MAY be required by some of the framing techniques\n\
    \      described, and is outside the scope of this specification.\n   Encoding\n\
    \      The definition of various encodings and scrambling is the\n      responsibility\
    \ of the DTE/DCE equipment in use, and is outside the\n      scope of this specification.\n\
    \      While PPP will operate without regard to the underlying\n      representation\
    \ of the bit stream, lack of standards for\n      transmission will hinder interoperability\
    \ as surely as lack of\n      data link standards.  The D-channel LAPD interface\
    \ requires NRZ\n      encoding at the T reference point.  Therefore, as a default,\
    \ it is\n      recommended that NRZ be used over the B-channel interface at the\
    \ T\n      reference point.  This will allow frames to be easily exchanged\n \
    \     between the B and D channels.\n      When configuration of the encoding\
    \ is allowed, NRZI is recommended\n      as an alternative in order to ensure\
    \ a minimum ones density where\n      required over the clear B-channel, with\
    \ caveats regarding FCS [2].\n      Historically, some implementations have used\
    \ Inverted NRZ (merely\n      switching the sense of mark and space), in order\
    \ to ensure a\n      minimum ones density with bit-synchronous HDLC.  The use\
    \ of\n      Inverted NRZ is deprecated.\n      Automatic Detection\n         Implementations\
    \ which desire to interoperate with multiple\n         encodings MAY choose to\
    \ detect those encodings automatically.\n         Automatic encoding detection\
    \ is particularly important for\n         Primary Rate Interfaces, to avoid extensive\
    \ pre-configuration.\n         Only simple encodings are currently distinguished.\n\
    \         The only reliable method of detection available is to switch\n     \
    \    modes between the supported encodings.  Transmission of the LCP\n       \
    \  Configure-Request SHOULD be tried twice for each mode before\n         switching\
    \ in rotation.  This ensures that sufficient time is\n         available for a\
    \ response to arrive from the peer.\n         Max-Configure MUST be set such that\
    \ the cumulative attempts\n         result in no more than 59 seconds of time\
    \ before disconnect.\n         It is preferable that the usual limit of 30 seconds\
    \ be\n         observed.\n      Prior Configuration\n         By prior configuration,\
    \ PPP MAY also be used with other\n         encodings.  Because of difficulty\
    \ distinguishing them, it is\n         not recommended that these encodings be\
    \ automatically detected.\n         Terminal adapters conforming to V.120 [4]\
    \ can be used as a\n         simple interface to workstations.  Asynchronous HDLC\
    \ framing\n         [2] is accepted at the R reference point.  The terminal adapter\n\
    \         provides async-sync conversion.  Multiple B-channels can be\n      \
    \   used in parallel.  Unfortunately, V.120 has a framing mode of\n         its\
    \ own for rate adaptation, which is difficult to distinguish\n         from Frame\
    \ Relay, and which can confuse in-band frame\n         detection.  V.120 is not\
    \ interoperable with bit-synchronous\n         links, since V.120 does not provide\
    \ octet-stuffing to bit-\n         stuffing conversion.  Therefore, V.120 is deprecated\
    \ in favor\n         of more modern standards, such as \"PPP in Frame Relay\"\
    .\n         The \"Bandwidth On Demand Interoperability Group\" has defined a\n\
    \         proposal called BONDING.  Multiple B-channels can be used in\n     \
    \    parallel.  BONDING has an initialization period of its own,\n         which\
    \ might conflict with the simple detection technique\n         described above,\
    \ and requires extensive individual\n         configuration in some current implementations\
    \ when multiple B-\n         channels are involved.  It is recommended that the\
    \ PPP Multi-\n         Link Procedure be used instead of BONDING.\n"
- title: 3.  Framing
  contents:
  - "3.  Framing\n   For B-channels, in the absence of prior configuration, the\n\
    \   implementation MUST first use bit-synchronous HDLC [2], as opposed to\n  \
    \ other framings, for initial link establishment.  This assumes that\n   circuit-switched\
    \ communications are generally [host | router] to\n   [host | router].\n   By\
    \ prior configuration, octet-synchronous HDLC [2] is recommended\n   where the\
    \ network termination equipment interfaces directly to the T\n   reference point,\
    \ and octet boundaries are available at the time of\n   framing.  Such equipment\
    \ is likely to be highly integrated, and the\n   elimination of bit-synchronous\
    \ hardware can reduce the part count,\n   resulting in lower cost interfaces and\
    \ simpler configuration.\n   Octet-synchronous HDLC MUST be used with NRZ bit\
    \ encoding.\n   For D-channels, by default no data service is expected.  By prior\n\
    \   configuration, \"PPP in X.25\" or \"PPP in Frame Relay\" framing MAY be\n\
    \   used.\n   Despite the fact that HDLC, LAPB, LAPD, and LAPF are nominally\n\
    \   distinguishable, multiple methods of framing SHOULD NOT be used\n   concurrently\
    \ on the same ISDN channel.  There is no requirement that\n   PPP recognize alternative\
    \ framing techniques, or switch between\n   framing techniques without specific\
    \ configuration.\n"
- title: 4.  Out-of-Band signaling
  contents:
  - "4.  Out-of-Band signaling\n   Experience has shown that the LLC Information Element\
    \ is not reliably\n   transmitted end to end.  The deployment of compatible switches\
    \ is too\n   limited, and the subscription policies of the providers are too\n\
    \   diverse.  Therefore, transmission of the LLC-IE SHOULD NOT be relied\n   upon\
    \ for framing or encoding determination.\n   No LLC-IE values which pertain to\
    \ PPP have been assigned.  Any other\n   values which are received are not valid\
    \ for PPP links, and can be\n   ignored for PPP service.\n   As an alternative\
    \ administrative measure, multiple directory numbers\n   can point to the same\
    \ physical access facility, by binding particular\n   services to each directory\
    \ number.  The called party identifier has\n   proven to be reliably provided\
    \ by the local switch.\n   When a called party identifier is used, or when a future\
    \ LLC-IE value\n   is assigned to PPP and the PPP value is received, if the LCP\
    \ has not\n   had the administrative Open event, the call MUST be rejected.\n\
    \   Receivers MUST NOT accept an incoming call, only to close the circuit\n  \
    \ or ignore packets from the circuit.\n"
- title: 5.  Configuration Details
  contents:
  - "5.  Configuration Details\n   The LCP recommended sync configuration options\
    \ apply to ISDN links.\n   The standard LCP sync configuration defaults apply\
    \ to ISDN links.\n   The typical network feeding the link is likely to have a\
    \ MRU of\n   either 1500, or 2048 or greater.  To avoid fragmentation, the\n \
    \  Maximum-Transmission-Unit (MTU) at the network layer SHOULD NOT\n   exceed\
    \ 1500, unless a peer MRU of 2048 or greater is specifically\n   negotiated.\n\
    \   Instead of a constant value for the Restart timer, the exponential\n   backoff\
    \ method is recommended.  The Restart Timer SHOULD be 250\n   milliseconds for\
    \ the initial value, and 3 seconds for the final\n   value.\n   Implementations\
    \ that include persistent dialing features, such as\n   \"demand dialing\" or\
    \ \"redialing\", SHOULD use mechanisms to limit their\n   persistence.  Examples\
    \ of such mechanisms include exponential\n   backoff, and discarding packet queues\
    \ after failure to complete link\n   establishment.  In some implementations,\
    \ discarding the transmit\n   queue can temporarily remove the stimulus to retry\
    \ the connection.\n"
