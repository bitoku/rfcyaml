  - "1.  Introduction and Scope\n   The Content Delivery Network Interconnection (CDNI)\
    \ working group is\n   developing a set of protocols to enable the interconnection\
    \ of\n   multiple content delivery networks (CDNs), as discussed in [RFC6770].\n\
    \   The CDNI protocol suite consists of multiple HTTP-based interfaces,\n   many\
    \ of which transfer various payloads encoded in JSON (JavaScript\n   Object Notation)\
    \ [RFC7159].  The main interfaces (i.e., CDNI Control\n   interface, CDNI Footprint\
    \ & Capabilities Advertisement interface,\n   CDNI Request Routing Redirection\
    \ interface, CDNI Metadata interface,\n   and CDNI Logging interface) are described\
    \ in [RFC7336].  It is\n   desirable to be able to indicate the type of object\
    \ carried in the\n   HTTP entity-body without having to register separate media\
    \ types for\n   each CDNI object.  To accomplish this aim, this document defines\
    \ a\n   single new media type for CDNI that includes a required payload-type\n\
    \   parameter.  A separate registry of CDNI payload-type parameters is\n   also\
    \ defined.  CDNI protocol specifications may register interface-\n   specific\
    \ payload types, specifying the payload encoding and parsing\n   semantics for\
    \ that message (e.g., JSON serialization for a CDNI\n   metadata object).  The\
    \ same payload-type parameter may also be used\n   as references for other purposes\
    \ (e.g., referencing CDNI metadata\n   objects from CDNI capability advertisement\
    \ objects).\n"

  - "2.  IANA Considerations\n   This section contains the CDNI media type registration\
    \ as well as the\n   payload-type parameter registry definition for IANA.\n"
- title: 2.1.  CDNI Media Type
  contents:
  - "2.1.  CDNI Media Type\n   Type name: application\n   Subtype name: cdni\n   Required\
    \ parameters:\n      ptype\n         The required parameter \"ptype\" describes\
    \ the type of CDNI\n         message contained in the message payload, as registered\
    \ in the\n         \"Content Delivery Network Interconnection (CDNI) Parameters\"\
    \n         registry (Section 2.2) defined below.\n   Optional parameters: none\n\
    \   Encoding considerations:\n      The CDNI protocol suite includes interfaces\
    \ with encoded messages\n      that may be 8bit or binary, as well as generic\
    \ logging information\n      that may be 7bit or binary.\n   Security considerations:\n\
    \      CDNI interfaces that return encoded data may be (mis)interpreted\n    \
    \  if parsed by non-CDNI or non-compliant CDNI implementations.  In\n      addition,\
    \ CDNI logging information is likely to transfer large\n      amounts of data\
    \ that may overload unexpecting clients.  The\n      individual CDNI interface\
    \ specifications provide more detailed\n      analysis of security and privacy\
    \ concerns, and define the\n      requirements for authentication, authorization,\
    \ confidentiality,\n      integrity, and privacy for each interface.\n      The\
    \ application/cdni media type is a generic media type to be used\n      by multiple\
    \ CDNI interfaces for transporting different types of\n      control and logging\
    \ information.  Proper validation of message\n      data requires parsing and\
    \ understanding the ptype parameter and\n      the associated data encoding. \
    \ Failure to properly validate\n      payloads may allow data extrusion under\
    \ the auspices of the\n      application/cdni media type.\n   Interoperability\
    \ considerations:\n      The required ptype field is intended to fully describe\
    \ the\n      structure and parsing of CDNI messages, as enforced by the ptype\n\
    \      registry designated expert.\n   Published specification: RFC 7736\n   Applications\
    \ that use this media type:\n      CDNI is intended for use between interconnected\
    \ CDNs for sharing\n      configuration and logging data, as well as for issuing\
    \ content\n      management and redirection requests.\n   Fragment identifier\
    \ considerations: N/A\n   Additional information: N/A\n      Deprecated alias\

- title: 2.2.  CDNI Payload-Types Parameters Registry
  contents:
  - "2.2.  CDNI Payload-Types Parameters Registry\n   IANA has created a new \"CDNI\
    \ Payload Types\" subregistry within the\n   \"Content Delivery Network Interconnection\
    \ (CDNI) Parameters\"\n   registry.  The \"CDNI Payload Types\" namespace defines\
    \ the valid\n   values for the required \"ptype\" parameter of the \"application/cdni\"\
    \n   media type.  The CDNI payload type is an ASCII string value that\n   consists\
    \ of only visible (printing) characters but excludes equal\n   signs (=), double\
    \ quotes (\"), and semicolons (;).  It will not exceed\n   256 characters in length.\
    \  The following Augmented Backus-Naur Form\n   (ABNF) definition of the CDNI\
    \ payload type is provided for clarity\n   [RFC5234]\n        ptype = 1*256(ptype-char)\n\
    \        ptype-char = %x21 / %x23-3A / %x3C / %x3E-7E\n          ; Includes ALPHA,\
    \ DIGIT, and other printables\n          ; Excludes equal signs (=), double quotes\
    \ (\"), semicolons (;)\n   Additions to the \"CDNI Payload Types\" namespace will\
    \ be made via\n   \"Specification Required\" as defined in [RFC5226].  The designated\n\
    \   expert will verify that new type definitions do not duplicate\n   existing\
    \ type definitions (in name or functionality), prevent\n   gratuitous additions\
    \ to the namespace, and prevent any additions to\n   the namespace that would\
    \ impair the interoperability of CDNI\n   implementations.  The designated expert\
    \ will review the\n   specification, even if it is a Standards Track RFC, to verify\
    \ that it\n   contains the following information:\n   o  The review will verify\
    \ that the specification contains a\n      reasonably defined purpose for the\
    \ new payload type.  A reasonably\n      defined purpose will relate to an existing\
    \ or proposed CDNI\n      interface and will not duplicate the functionality of\
    \ any existing\n      CDNI protocol feature without specifying a rational reason\
    \ (e.g.,\n      updating an obsolete feature), a method for detecting and handling\n\
    \      conflicts (e.g., a versioning system with prioritization matrix),\n   \
    \   and a suggested migration path (e.g., deprecation of the\n      overlapped\
    \ feature, or justification for co-existence).\n   o  The review will verify that\
    \ the specification contains information\n      as to which CDNI interface the\
    \ new payload type pertains or\n      affects.  The payload type may be applicable\
    \ to multiple CDNI\n      interfaces, but the justification for the new payload\
    \ type will\n      include a reasonable relationship to at least one Standards\
    \ Track\n      CDNI interface.\n   o  The review will verify that the specification\
    \ contains sufficient\n      detail about the data encoding (e.g., JSON serialization\
    \ for new\n      CDNI metadata or capability advertisement objects, or ABNF and\n\
    \      description for new CDNI logging file formats) to allow senders\n     \
    \ and receivers of the new payload type to implement compliant and\n      interoperable\
    \ payload parsers.\n   The registry contains the payload type and the specification\n\
    \   describing the payload type.  The registry will initially be\n   unpopulated.\n\
