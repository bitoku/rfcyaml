  - "    Illinois' reply to Maxwell's Request for Graphics Information,\n        \
    \                  NIC Document 14925.\nThis is a reply to Craig Maxwell's (UCLA-NMC)\
    \ \"Request for graphics\ninformation\" of 3/7/73.  Further details can be obtained\
    \ by contacting\nme directly.\nTo date, our work in graphics has been primarily\
    \ centered about support\nfor several applications groups.  To make the generation\
    \ of beam-\noriented graphics as painless as possible for these groups, our policy\n\
    for supporting this type of graphics has been to emulate as closely as\npossible\
    \ the CALCOMP plotter support package on the host machine, but\nwith NGP0 output.\
    \  (Presently, before the resulting NGP can be sent to\nsome of our peripherals,\
    \ e.g., Gould 4800, it must be converted to\ndevice specifics.  With the advent\
    \ of ANTS MARK II and a PDP-11/45, all\nconversions will be handled locally, so\
    \ all graphics flowing into our\nsystem will be NGP).  We find this approach very\
    \ labor-saving, even at\nthe present slightly kludgey level.\nWe also have some\
    \ grey-scale work taking place on our GOULD and IMLAC.\nOne group is processing\
    \ satellite pictures on Illiac and will soon need\ngrey-scale output, another\
    \ is producing natural-resource maps, and a\nthird is generating holograms.  No\
    \ standardization plans have been made\nfor grey scale work, but if an acceptable\
    \ standard is established, we\nwill most likely use it.\nA small group, including\
    \ myself, is currently planning an interactive\ngraphics system.  The system will\
    \ use multiple hosts, possibly using a\nremote E&S machine for rotation, scaling,\
    \ etc.  We have a number of\nlarge hurdles that have to be jumped before we can\
    \ do anything, though.\nSeveral of these are not graphics-specific, such as process-controlled\n\
    FTP, inter-process coordination among hosts, and others.  We had\nintended to\
    \ let efficiency dictate the format of intermediate results\nshipped via the Net,\
    \ with standardization being applied where it is\nhelpful for minimizing effort.\
    \  Since the system will be highly\ninteractive and will also manipulate grey-scale\
    \ data, we will need a\nhigher level of graphics protocol to handle the user interface.\
    \  A\n\"proto-prototype\" system is being used now to do some simple\nmanipulations\
    \ of meteorological data (e.g., contouring, 3-D plotting)\nwith an IMLAC passively\
    \ displaying the NGP0 pictures created.  Soon, I\nhope to finish an IMLAC program\
    \ that will handle some interaction with\nthe mouse/keyset.  I have decided to\
    \ implement the following (outgoing)\ncommands.\n    MOVE  beam to mouse position\n\
    \    DRAW  from last to present beam position.\n    TEXT  at present beam position.\n\
    \    UNDO  the last command (to facilitate freehand drawing and\n          backspacing\
    \ in TEXT).\nOther commands may be implemented as needed to do what people want\
    \ to\ndo, at least until an adequate interaction standard comes along.\nNote that\
    \ there is implicit in the UNDO command the assumption that\nthe other end of\
    \ the line possesses a certain amount of memory and\nintelligence.  Two possible\
    \ philosophies for standardizing interaction\nare that (1) all \"nodes\" (\"generators\"\
    \ or \"users\" of data) understand\nsome set of commands and possess at least\
    \ a certain amount of\nintelligence, and (2) a distinction is made between \"\
    displays\" and\n\"computers\" (quotes because the line is fuzzy).  I favor the\
    \ first for\nits generality, but I suggest that the lowest level of interactive\n\
    graphics might want to use the second for ease of implementation with\nunintelligent\
    \ devices, e.g., COMPUTEK 400's.  (I do not mean to\nimply in (1) that the actual\
    \ \"computer\" would not have a larger\nvocabulary than the actual \"display\"\
    \ --this is inevitable with higher\nlevel capabilities in the protocol).\nSince\
    \ we have almost no local computing power for applications work,\nall our graphics\
    \ computation is done remotely (our work has been\nprimarily at UCSD (B6700),\
    \ USC-ISI (TENEX), and UCLA-CCN (360)).\nBecause we do our work at scattered sites\
    \ and are basically economic\nof labor (pronounced \"lazy\"), we have a lot to\
    \ gain by standards and\nwill be glad to cooperate as much as possible with standardization\n\
    efforts.\nSteve Bunch\n       [ This RFC was put into machine readable form for\
