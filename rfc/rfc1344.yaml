    \            Implications of MIME for Internet Mail Gateways\n          Status\
    \ of This Memo\n            This is an informational memo for  the  Internet \
    \ community,\n            and  requests  discussion  and suggestions for improvements.\n\
    \            This  memo  does   not   specify   an   Internet   standard.\n  \
    \          Distribution of this memo is unlimited.\n          Abstract\n     \
    \       The recent development of MIME (Multipurpose  Internet  Mail\n       \
    \     Extensions)  offers  a  wide  range of new opportunities for\n         \
    \   electronic mail system systems.  Most of these  opportunites\n           \
    \ are relevant only to user agents, the programs that interact\n            with\
    \ human users when they send and receive mail.   However,\n            some  opportunities\
    \  are  also  opened up for mail transport\n            systems.  While MIME was\
    \ carefully designed so that it  does\n            not  require  any  changes\
    \  to  Internet  electronic message\n            transport  facilities,  there\
    \  are  several  ways  in  which\n            message  transport  systems  may\
    \  want  to take advantage of\n            MIME.  These opportunities are the\
    \ subject of this memo.\n          Background -- The MIME Format\n           \
    \ Recently, a new standardized format  has  been  defined  for\n            enhanced\
    \  electronic  mail  messages  on the Internet.  This\n            format, known\
    \ as MIME, permits messages  to  include,  in  a\n            standardized  manner,\
    \  non-ASCII  text, images, audio, and a\n            variety of other kinds of\
    \ interesting data.\n            The  MIME  effort  was  explicitly  focused \
    \  on   requiring\n            absolutely  no  changes  at  the  message  transport\
    \  level.\n            Because of this fact, MIME-format mail runs transparently\
    \ on\n            all  known  Internet  or  Internet-style mail systems.  This\n\
    \            means that those concerned solely with the  maintenance  and\n  \
    \          development  of message transport services can safely ignore\n    \
    \        MIME completely, if they so choose.\n            However, the fact that\
    \ MIME can be ignored, for the  purpose\n            of  message  transport, \
    \ does  not  necessarily mean that it\n            should be  ignored.   In  particular,\
    \  MIME  offers  several\n            features that should be of interest to those\
    \ responsible for\n            message transport services. By  exploiting  these\
    \  features,\n            transport  systems  can  provide certain additional\
    \ kinds of\n            service that are currently unavailable, and can alleviate\
    \  a\n            few existing problems.\n            The remainder of this document\
    \  is  an  attempt  to  briefly\n            point  out  and  summarize some important\
    \ ways in which MIME\n            RFC 1344           MIME and Mail Gateways  \
    \        June 1992\n            may be of use for message transport systems. \
    \ This  document\n            makes no attempt to present a complete technical\
    \ description\n            of MIME, however.  For that, the reader is  refered\
    \  to  the\n            MIME document itself [RFC-1341].\n          Mail Transport\
    \ and Gateway Services:  A Key Distinction\n            Before implementing any\
    \ of the mechanisms discussed in  this\n            memo,  one  should  be familiar\
    \ with the distinction between\n            mail transport service and mail gateway\
    \ service.  Basically,\n            mail  transport software is responsible for\
    \ moving a message\n            within a homogeneous electronic mail service network.\
    \   Mail\n            gateways,  on  the  other  hand,  exchange  mail between\
    \ two\n            significantly different  mail  environments,  including  via\n\
    \            non-electronic services, such as postal mail.\n            In general,\
    \ it is widely considered  unacceptable  for  mail\n            transport  services\
    \  to  alter the contents of messages.  In\n            the case of mail gateways,\
    \ however, such alteration is often\n            inevitable.  Thus, strictly speaking,\
    \ many of the mechanisms\n            described here apply only to gateways, \
    \ and  should  not  be\n            used  in  simple  mail  transport  systems.\
    \   However, it is\n            possible that some very special situations --\
    \ e.g., an  SMTP\n            relay   that  transports  mail  across  extremely\
    \  expensive\n            intercontinental network  links  --  might  need  to\
    \  modify\n            messages,  in order to provide appropriate service for\
    \ those\n            situations, and hence must redefine its role to be that of\
    \ a\n            gateway.\n            In this memo, it is assumed that transformations\
    \ which alter\n            a message's contents will be performed only by gateways,\
    \ but\n            it is recognized that some existing  mail  transport  agents\n\
    \            may  choose to reclassify themselves as gateways in order to\n  \
    \          perform the functions described here.\n          Rejected Messages\n\
    \            An unfortunately frequent duty of message transport services\n  \
    \          is  the  rejection  of  mail to the sender.  This may happen\n    \
    \        because the mail was undeliverable, or because  it  did  not\n      \
    \      conform  to  the requirements of a gateway (e.g., it was too\n        \
    \    large).\n            There has never been a standard format for rejected\
    \ messages\n            in  the  past.   This has been an annoyance, but not a\
    \ major\n            problem for text messages.  For non-text messages,  however,\n\
    \            the  lack  of  a  standard rejection format is more crucial,\n  \
    \          because rejected messages typically appear to be  text,  and\n    \
    \        the  user  who  finds  himself viewing images or audio as if\n      \
    \      they were text is rarely happy with the result.\n            MIME makes\
    \ it very easy to encapsulate messages  in  such  a\n            way  that  their\
    \  semantics  are  completely preserved.  The\n            simplest way to do\
    \ this is to make each rejection  notice  a\n            RFC 1344           MIME\
    \ and Mail Gateways          June 1992\n            MIME  \"multipart/mixed\"\
    \  message.   That  multipart  message\n            would contain two parts, a\
    \ text part explaining  the  reason\n            for  the  rejection,  and  an\
    \ encapsulated message part that\n            contained the rejected message itself.\n\
    \            It should be stressed that the transport software  does  not\n  \
    \          need  to understand the structure of the rejected message at\n    \
    \        all.  It  merely  needs  to  encapsulate  it  properly.  The\n      \
    \      following,  for  example,  shows how any MIME message may be\n        \
    \    encapsulated in a rejection message in such a way  that  all\n          \
    \  information  will be immediately visible in the correct form\n            if\
    \ the  recipient  reads  it  with  a  MIME-conformant  mail\n            reader:\n\

    \ MESSAGE, starting with the headers,\n                 goes here.\n         \
    \        --unique-boundary--\n            In  the  above  example,  the  ONLY\
    \  thing   that   is   not\n            'boilerplate\"  is the choice of boundary\
    \ string.  The phrase\n            \"unique-boundary\" should be replaced by a\
    \ string  that  does\n            not  appear  (prefixed  by  two  hyphens) in\
    \ any of the body\n            parts.\n            Encapsulating a message in\
    \ this manner is very easily  done,\n            and  will  constitute  a  significant\
    \  service  that message\n            transport services can perform for MIME\
    \ users.\n            IMPORTANT NOTE:  The format given above  is  simply  one\
    \  of\n            many possible ways to format a rejection message using MIME.\n\
    \            Independent IETF efforts are needed in order to  standardize\n  \
    \          the format of rejections and acknowledgements.\n            RFC 1344\
    \           MIME and Mail Gateways          June 1992\n          Fragmenting and\
    \ Reassembling Large Messages\n            One  problem  that  occurs  with  increasing\
    \  frequency   in\n            Internet  mail  is the rejection of messages because\
    \ of size\n            limitations.   This  problem  can  be   expected   to \
    \  grow\n            substantially  more  severe  with the acceptance of MIME,\
    \ as\n            MIME invites the use of very large objects  such  as  images\n\
    \            and audio clips.  Fortunately, MIME also provides mechanisms\n  \
    \          that can help alleviate the problem.\n            One particularly\
    \ relevant MIME  type  is  \"message/partial\",\n            which  can  be  used\
    \  for  the  automatic  fragmentation and\n            reassembly of large mail\
    \ messages.  The message/partial type\n            can be handled entirely at\
    \ the user agent level, but message\n            transport services can also make\
    \ use of this type to provide\n            more intelligent behavior at gateways.\n\
    \            In particular, when gatewaying mail to or from a  system  or\n  \
    \          network  known  to enforce size limitations that are more or\n    \
    \        less stringent than are enforced locally, message  transport\n      \
    \      services  might  choose either to break a large message into\n        \
    \    fragments, or (perhaps less likely) to reassemble  fragments\n          \
    \  into  a  larger  message.   The  combination  of  these  two\n            behaviors\
    \ can make the  overall  Internet  mail  environment\n            appear more\
    \ complete and seamless than it actually is.\n            Details on the message/partial\
    \ format may be  found  in  the\n            MIME  document.   What follows is\
    \ an example of how a simple\n            short message  might  be  broken  into\
    \  two  message/partial\n            messages.   In  practice,  of  course,  the\
    \  message/partial\n            facility would only be likely to be  used  for\
    \  much  longer\n            messages.\n            The following initial message:\n\

    \            Fragmenting such messages rather than rejecting  them  might\n  \
    \          be  a  reasonable option for some gateway services, at least\n    \
    \        for a certain range of message  sizes.   Of  course,  it  is\n      \
    \      often  difficult for a gateway to know what size limitations\n        \
    \    will  be encountered \"downstream\",  but intelligent  guesses\n        \
    \    are often possible.  Moreover, an IETF working group on SMTP\n          \
    \  extensions has proposed augmenting SMTP with a  \"SIZE\"  verb\n          \
    \  that   would   facilitate  this  process,  thereby  possibly\n            requiring\
    \  fragmentation   on   the   fly   during   message\n            transmission.\n\
    \            Note also that fragmentation or reassembly might  reasonably\n  \
    \          be  performed,  in  differing  circumstances,  by either the\n    \
    \        sending or receiving gateway  systems,  depending  on  which\n      \
    \      system knew more about the capabilities of the other.\n          Using\
    \ or Removing External-Body Pointers\n            Another MIME type oriented to\
    \ extremely  large  messages  is\n            the  \"message/external-body\" type.\
    \  In this type of message,\n            all or part of the body data is not included\
    \ in  the  actual\n            message  itself.   Instead,  the  Content-Type\
    \  header field\n            includes information that tells how the  body  data\
    \  can  be\n            retrieved -- either via a file system, via anonymous ftp,\
    \ or\n            via other mechanisms.\n            The message/external-body\
    \ type provides  a  new  option  for\n            mail  transport  services  that\
    \  wishes  to optimize the way\n            bandwidth resources are used in a\
    \  given  environment.   For\n            example, the basic use of message/external-body\
    \ is to reduce\n            bandwidth in email traffic. However, when  email \
    \ crosses  a\n            RFC 1344           MIME and Mail Gateways          June\
    \ 1992\n            slow and expensive boundary -- e.g., a satellite link across\n\
    \            the Pacific -- it might make  sense  to  retrieve  the  data\n  \
    \          itself  and  transform  the external-body reference into the\n    \
    \        actual data.  Alternately, it might make sense to  copy  the\n      \
    \      data  itself  to  a  new  location,  closer  to  the message\n        \
    \    recipients, and  change  the  location  pointed  to  in  the\n          \
    \  message.    Because   the  external-body  specification  can\n            include\
    \ an expiration date, message transport  services  can\n            trade  off\
    \  storage  and  bandwidth  capabilities  to try to\n            optimize  the\
    \  overall  use  of  resources  for  very  large\n            messages.\n    \
    \        Such behaviors by a  gateway  require  careful  analysis  of\n      \
    \      cost/benefit   tradeoffs  and  would be a dramatic departure\n        \
    \    from  typical  mail  transport   services.    However,   the\n          \
    \  potential  benefits  are quite significant, so that such the\n            appropriate\
    \ use of these service options should be explored.\n            For example, the\
    \ following message includes PostScript  data\n            by external reference:\n\

    \            A gateway to Australia might choose to copy the file  to  an\n  \

    \ a message is copied to a  local\n            FTP  site,  one  could  offer two\
    \ external body parts as the\n            alternatives, allowing the user agent\
    \ to  choose  which  FTP\n            site is preferred.\n          Image and\
    \ other Format Conversions\n            MIME currently defines  two  image  formats,\
    \  image/gif  and\n            image/jpeg.   The  former  is  much more convenient\
    \ for many\n            users, and can be displayed more quickly  on  many  systems.\n\
    \            The  latter  is  a  much  more  compact  representation, and\n  \
    \          therfore places less stress on mail transport facilities.\n       \
    \     Message  transport  services  can  optimize  both  transport\n         \
    \   bandwidth  and  user  convenience by intelligent translation\n           \
    \ between these formats (and other formats that might be added\n            later).\
    \   When  a message of type image/gif is submitted for\n            RFC 1344 \
    \          MIME and Mail Gateways          June 1992\n            long-haul delivery,\
    \ it might  reasonably  be  translated  to\n            image/jpeg.   Conversely,\
    \  when  image/jpeg data is received\n            for  final  delivery  on  a\
    \  system  with  adequate  storage\n            resources,  it  might  be  translated\
    \  to  image/gif for the\n            convenience of the recipient.   Software\
    \  to  perform  these\n            translations  is  widely  available.   It \
    \ should  be noted,\n            however,  that  performance  of  such  conversions\
    \  presumes\n            support for the new format by the recipient.\n      \
    \      Although MIME currently only defines one audio format,  more\n        \
    \    are  likely  to  be  defined and registered with IANA in the\n          \
    \  future.  In that case, similar format conversion  facilities\n            might\
    \ be appropriate for audio.\n            If format conversion is done,  it  is\
    \  STRONGLY  RECOMMENDED\n            that some kind of trace information (probably\
    \ in the form of\n            a Received header field) should be added  to  a\
    \  message  to\n            document the conversion that has been performed.\n\
    \            Some people have expressed concerns,  or  even  the  opinion\n  \
    \          that  conversions  should  never be done.  To accomodate the\n    \
    \        desires of those who dislike the idea  of  automatic  format\n      \
    \      conversion.   For  this  reason,  it  is suggested that such\n        \
    \    transformations be generally restricted to  gateways  rather\n          \
    \  than  general  message transport services, and that services\n            which\
    \ perform such conversions  should  be  sensitive  to  a\n            header field\
    \ that indicates that the sender does not wish to\n            have any such conversions\
    \ performed.  A suggested value  for\n            this header field is:\n    \
    \        Content-Conversion: prohibited\n            User agents that wish to\
    \ explicitly indicate  a  willingness\n            for such conversions to be\
    \ performed may use:\n            Content-Conversion: permitted\n            However,\
    \  this  will  be  the  default  assumption  of  many\n            gateways, \
    \ so  this  header field is not strictly necessary.\n            It also should\
    \ be noted  that  such  control  of  conversion\n            would only be available\
    \ to the sender, rather than to any of\n            the recipients.\n        \
    \    RFC 1344           MIME and Mail Gateways          June 1992\n          Robust\
    \ Encoding of Data\n            In addition to all the  reasons  given  above\
    \  for  possible\n            transformation  of  body data, it will sometimes\
    \ be the case\n            that a gateway can tell that the body data, as  given,\
    \  will\n            not  robustly  survive  the  next  step  of  transport. \
    \ For\n            example, mail crossing an ASCII-to-EBCDIC gateway will  lose\n\
    \            information  if certain characters are used.  In such cases,\n  \
    \          a gateway can make the data more robust simply  by  applying\n    \
    \        one of the MIME Content-Transfer-Encoding algorithms (base64\n      \
    \      or quoted-printable) to the body or body  part.   This  will\n        \
    \    generally  be  a  loss-less transformation, but care must be\n          \
    \  taken  to  ensure  that  the  resulting  message  is   MIME-\n            conformant\
    \  if  the inital message was not.  (For example, a\n            MIME-Version\
    \ header field may need to be added.)\n          User-oriented concerns\n    \
    \        If a gateway is going to perform major transformations on  a\n      \
    \      mail  message,  such as translating image formats or mapping\n        \
    \    between included data and external-reference data, it  seems\n          \
    \  inevitable that there will be situations in which users will\n            object\
    \ to these transformations.  This is, in large part, an\n            implementation\
    \  issue,  but  it  seems  advisable,  wherever\n            possible, to provide\
    \ a mechanism whereby users can  specify,\n            to  the  transport  system,\
    \  whether  or  not they want such\n            services performed automatically\
    \ on their behalf. The use of\n            the  \"Content-Conversion\"  header\
    \ field, as mentioned above,\n            is suggested for this purpose, since\
    \ it  it  least  provides\n            some control by the sender, if not the\
    \ recipient.\n          References\n            [RFC-1341]    Borenstein,   N.,\
