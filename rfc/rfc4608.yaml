  - "1.  Introduction\n   Current Protocol Independent Multicast - Sparse Mode (PIM-SM)\n\
    \   [RFC4601] relies on the shared Rendezvous Point (RP) tree to learn\n   about\
    \ active sources for a group and to support group-generic (Any\n   Source Multicast\
    \ or ASM) data distribution.  The IP Multicast group\n   address range 232/8 has\
    \ been designated for Source-Specific Multicast\n   [RFC3569] applications and\
    \ protocols [IANA] and SHOULD support\n   source-only trees only, precluding the\
    \ requirement of an RP and a\n   shared tree; active sources in the 232/8 range\
    \ will be discovered out\n   of band.  PIM Sparse Mode Designated Routers (DR)\
    \ with local\n   membership are capable of joining the shortest path tree for\
    \ the\n   source directly using SSM functionality of PIM-SM.\n   Operational best\
    \ common practices in the 232/8 group address range\n   are necessary to ensure\
    \ shortest path source-only trees across\n   multiple domains in the Internet\
    \ [RFC3569], and to prevent data from\n   sources sending to groups in the 232/8\
    \ range from arriving via shared\n   trees.  This avoids unwanted data arrival\
    \ and allows several sources\n   to use the same group address without conflict\
    \ at the receivers.\n   The operational practices SHOULD:\n      o  Prevent local\
    \ sources from sending to shared tree\n      o  Prevent receivers from joining\
    \ the shared tree\n      o  Prevent RPs as candidates for 232/8\n      o  Prevent\
    \ remote sources from being learned/joined via Multicast\n         Source Discovery\
    \ Protocol (MSDP) [RFC3618]\n"
- title: 1.1.  BCP, Experimental Protocols, and Normative References
  contents:
  - "1.1.  BCP, Experimental Protocols, and Normative References\n   This document\
    \ describes the best current practice for a widely\n   deployed Experimental protocol,\
    \ MSDP.  There is no plan to advance\n   MSDP's status (for example, to Proposed\
    \ Standard).  The reasons for\n   this include:\n      o  MSDP was originally\
    \ envisioned as a temporary protocol to be\n         supplanted by whatever the\
    \ Inter-Domain Multicast Routing\n         (IDMR) working group produced as an\
    \ inter-domain protocol.\n         However, the IDMR WG (or subsequently, the\
    \ Border Gateway\n         Multicast Protocol (BGMP) WG) never produced a protocol\
    \ that\n         could be deployed to replace MSDP.\n      o  One of the primary\
    \ reasons given for MSDP to be classified as\n         Experimental was that the\
    \ MSDP Working Group came up with\n         modifications to the protocol that\
    \ the WG thought made it\n         better but that implementors didn't see any\
    \ reasons to deploy.\n         Without these modifications (e.g., UDP or GRE encapsulation),\n\
    \         MSDP can have negative consequences to initial packets in\n        \
    \ datagram streams.\n      o  Scalability: Although we don't know what the hard\
    \ limits might\n         be, readvertising everything you know every 60 seconds\
    \ clearly\n         limits the amount of state you can advertise.\n      o  MSDP\
    \ reached nearly ubiquitous deployment as the de facto\n         standard inter-domain\
    \ multicast protocol in the IPv4 Internet.\n      o  No consensus could be reached\
    \ regarding the reworking of MSDP\n         to address the many concerns of various\
    \ constituencies within\n         the IETF.  As a result, a decision was taken\
    \ to document what\n         is (ubiquitously) deployed and to move that document\
    \ to\n         Experimental.  Although advancement of MSDP to Proposed\n     \
    \    Standard was considered, for the reasons mentioned above, it\n         was\
    \ immediately discarded.\n      o  The advent of protocols such as source-specific\
    \ multicast and\n         bi-directional PIM, as well as embedded RP techniques\
    \ for IPv6,\n         have further reduced consensus that a replacement protocol\
    \ for\n         MSDP for the IPv4 Internet is required.\n   The RFC Editor's policy\
    \ regarding references is that they be split\n   into two categories known as\
    \ \"normative\" and \"informative\".\n   Normative references specify those documents\
    \ that must be read for\n   one to understand or implement the technology in an\
    \ RFC (or whose\n   technology must be present for the technology in the new RFC\
    \ to work)\n   [RFCED].  In order to understand this document, one must also\n\
    \   understand both the PIM [RFC4601] and MSDP [RFC3618] documents.  As a\n  \
    \ result, references to these documents are normative.\n   The IETF has adopted\
    \ the policy that BCPs must not have normative\n   references to Experimental\
    \ protocols.  However, this document is a\n   special case in that the underlying\
    \ Experimental document (MSDP) is\n   not planned to be advanced to Proposed Standard.\n\
    \   The MBONED Working Group requests approval under the Variance\n   Procedure\
    \ as documented in RFC 2026 [RFC2026].  The IESG followed the\n   Variance Procedure\
    \ and, after an additional 4-week IETF Last Call,\n   evaluated the comments and\
    \ status and has approved the document.\n   The key words \"MUST\"\", \"MUST NOT\"\
    , \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\"\
    , \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n   document are to be interpreted as described\
    \ in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].\n"

  contents:
  - "2.1.  Preventing Local Sources from Sending to Shared Tree\n   In order to eliminate\
    \ the use of shared trees for groups in 232/8,\n   while maintaining coexistence\
    \ with ASM in PIM-SM, the behavior of the\n   RP and/or the DR needs to be modified.\
    \  This can be accomplished by\n      -  preventing data for 232/8 groups from\
    \ being sent encapsulated\n         to the RP by the DR,\n      -  preventing\
    \ the RP from accepting registers for 232/8 groups\n         from the DR, and\n\
    \      -  preventing the RP from forwarding accepted data down (*,G) tree\n  \
    \       for 232/8 groups.\n"
- title: 2.2.  Preventing Remote Sources from Being Learned/Joined via MSDP
  contents:
  - "2.2.  Preventing Remote Sources from Being Learned/Joined via MSDP\n   SSM does\
    \ not require active source announcements via MSDP.  All\n   source announcements\
    \ are received out of band, and the last hop\n   router is responsible for sending\
    \ (S,G) joins directly to the source.\n   To prevent propagation of SAs in the\
    \ 232/8 range, an RP SHOULD\n      -  never originate an SA for any 232/8 groups,\
    \ and\n      -  never accept or forward an SA for any 232/8 groups.\n"
- title: 2.3.  Preventing Receivers from Joining the Shared Tree
  contents:
  - "2.3.  Preventing Receivers from Joining the Shared Tree\n   Local PIM domain\
    \ practices need to be enforced to prevent local\n   receivers from joining the\
    \ shared tree for 232/8 groups.  This can be\n   accomplished by\n      -  preventing\
    \ DR from sending (*,G) joins for 232/8 groups, and\n      -  preventing RP from\
    \ accepting (*,G) join for 232/8 groups.\n   However, within a local PIM domain,\
    \ any last-hop router NOT\n   preventing (*,G) joins may trigger unwanted (*,G)\
    \ state toward the RP\n   that intersects an existing (S,G) tree, allowing the\
    \ receiver on the\n   shared tree to receive the data, which breaks the source-specific\n\
    \   [RFC3569] service model.  It is therefore recommended that ALL\n   routers\
    \ in the domain MUST reject AND never originate (*,G) joins for\n   232/8 groups.\n\
    \   In those cases in which an ISP is offering its customers (or others)\n   the\
    \ use of the ISP's RP, the ISP SHOULD NOT allow (*,G) joins in the\n   232/8 range.\n"
- title: 2.4.  Preventing RPs as Candidates for 232/8
  contents:
  - "2.4.  Preventing RPs as Candidates for 232/8\n   Because SSM does not require\
    \ an RP, all RPs SHOULD NOT offer\n   themselves as candidates in the 232/8 range.\
    \  This can be\n   accomplished by\n      -  preventing RP/BSR from announcing\
    \ in the 232/8 range,\n      -  preventing ALL routers from accepting RP delegations\
    \ in the\n         232/8 range, and\n      -  precluding RP functionality on RP\
    \ for the 232/8 range.\n   Note that in typical practice, RPs announce themselves\
    \ as candidates\n   for the 224/4 (which obviously includes 232/8).  It is still\n\
    \   acceptable to allow the advertisement of 224/4 (or any other superset\n  \
    \ of 232/8); however, this approach relies on the second point, above;\n   namely,\
    \ that routers silently ignore the RP delegation in the 232/8\n   range and prevent\
    \ sending or receiving using the shared tree, as\n   described previously.  Finally,\
    \ an RP SHOULD NOT be configured as a\n   candidate RP for 232/8 (or for a more\
    \ specific range).\n"

  contents:
  - "4.  Security Considerations\n   This document describes operational practices\
    \ that introduce no new\n   security issues to PIM-SM [RFC4601] in either or SSM\
    \ [RFC3569] or ASM\n   operation.\n   However, in the event that the operational\
    \ practices described in\n   this document are not adhered to, some problems may\
    \ surface.  In\n   particular, Section 2.3 describes the effects of non-compliance\
    \ of\n   last-hop routers (or, to some degree, rogue hosts sending PIM\n   messages\
    \ themselves) on the source-specific service model.  Creating\n   the (*,G) state\
    \ for source-specific (S,G) could enable a receiver to\n   receive data it should\
    \ not get.  This can be mitigated by host-side\n   multicast source filtering.\n"
