  - "Abstract\n   This document defines an extension to the DHCP protocols that allows\n\
    \   a relay agent to use any available source port for upstream\n   communications.\
    \  The extension also allows inclusion of a DHCP option\n   that can be used to\
    \ statelessly route responses back to the\n   appropriate source port on downstream\
    \ communications.\n"

  - "1.  Introduction\n   RFC 2131 [RFC2131] and RFC 3315 [RFC3315] specify the use\
    \ of UDP as\n   the transport protocol for DHCP.  They also define both the server-\n\
    \   and client-side port numbers.  The IPv4 server port is UDP number\n   (67)\
    \ and the client port is UDP number (68); for IPv6, the server\n   port is (547)\
    \ and the client port is (546).\n   The fixed UDP port combinations for the DHCP\
    \ protocol scheme creates\n   challenges in certain DHCP relay operations.  For\
    \ instance, in a\n   large-scale DHCP relay implementation on a single-switch\
    \ node, the\n   DHCP relay functionality may be partitioned among multiple relay\n\
    \   processes.  All of these DHCP relay processes may share the same IP\n   address\
    \ of the switch node.  If the UDP source port has to be a fixed\n   number as\
    \ currently specified, the transport socket operation of DHCP\n   packets would\
    \ need to go through a central entity or process, which\n   would defeat the purpose\
    \ of distributing DHCP relay functionality.\n   In some large-scale deployments,\
    \ the decision to split the DHCP\n   functionality into multiple processes on\
    \ a node may not be purely\n   based on DHCP relay computational load.  Rather,\
    \ DHCP relay could\n   just be one of the functions in a multi-process implementation.\n\
    \   Although assigning a different IPv4/IPv6 source address for each DHCP\n  \
    \ relay process can be a solution, this would introduce operational and\n   network\
    \ management complexities, especially given the scarceness of\n   IPv4 addresses.\n\
    \   This document defines an extension to relax the fixed UDP source port\n  \
    \ requirement for the DHCP relay agents.  This extension requires a\n   DHCP server\
    \ to remember the inbound packet's UDP port number along\n   with the IPv4/IPv6\
    \ address.  When sending back replies, the DHCP\n   server MUST use the UDP port\
    \ number that the incoming relay agent\n   uses instead of the fixed DHCP port\
    \ number.  In the case of\n   IPv6-cascaded relay agents [RFC3315], the upstream\
    \ relay agent needs\n   to use the \"Relay Source Port Option\" to record the\
    \ downstream source\n   port, and it MUST use this recorded port number instead\
    \ of the fixed\n   DHCP port number when replaying the reply messages.\n"

    \ when\n   it uses a non-DHCP UDP port (not 547) to communicate to a DHCPv6\n\
    \   server or an upstream IPv6 relay agent.  Also, when an IPv6 relay\n   agent\
    \ detects that a downstream relay agent uses a non-DHCP UDP port\n   in the packet,\
    \ it MUST record the port number in the \"Downstream\n   Source Port\" field of\
    \ this option.  If this option is included to\n   indicate only the local non-DHCP\
    \ UDP port usage and the port is not\n   being used by a downstream relay agent,\
    \ the Downstream Source Port\n   field MUST be set to zero.\n   The IPv6 relay\
    \ agent MUST include this option in the following three\n   cases:\n   1.  The\
    \ local relay agent uses a non-DHCP UDP port (not 547).\n   2.  The downstream\
    \ relay agent uses a non-DHCP UDP port (not 547).\n   3.  The local relay agent\
    \ and the downstream relay agent both use\n       non-DHCP UDP ports (not 547).\n\
    \   In the first case, the value of the \"Downstream Source Port\" field is\n\
    \   set to zero.  In the other two cases, the value of the field is set\n   to\
    \ the UDP port number that the downstream relay agent uses.\n   When an IPv6 server\

    \ it MUST copy the option when constructing the\n   Relay-reply chain in response\
    \ to the Relay-forward message.  This\n   option MUST NOT appear in any message\
    \ other than a Relay-forward or\n   Relay-reply message.  Additionally, the IPv6\
    \ server MUST check and\n   use the UDP source port from the UDP packet of the\
    \ Relay-forward\n   message in replying to the relay agent.\n   When a relay agent\
    \ receives a Relay-reply message with the \"Relay\n   Source Port Option\" from\
    \ a server or from an upstream relay agent, if\n   the \"Downstream Source Port\"\

- title: 5.4.  Deployment Considerations
  contents:
  - "5.4.  Deployment Considerations\n   During deployment, the operator and/or user\
    \ of the new DHCP play port\n   implementation should upgrade the DHCP server\
    \ before the relay\n   implementations are deployed.  This would ensure that the\
    \ erroneous\n   case noted in Section 5.3 is not encountered.  If the upstream\
    \ relay\n   agent or server does not support this extension, this DHCP relay port\n\
    \   feature needs to be disabled.\n   When the DHCP relay port implementation\
    \ is deployed, the default\n   relay agent behavior should use the DHCP UDP port,\
    \ and it is\n   recommended that the configuration be set up to allow for the\
    \ mode of\n   operation where a non-DHCP port can be used for the DHCP relay\n\
    \   agents.\n   If the network uses a firewall to block or allow DHCP packets\
    \ with\n   both static UDP source and destination port numbers, this may no\n\
    \   longer match the packets from new DHCP relay agent and server\n   software\
    \ with this extension.  The firewall rules need to be modified\n   to match only\
    \ the DHCP server side of the UDP port number and, if\n   necessary, IP addresses\

    \       <----------        <----------        <----------\n   In the above diagram,\
    \ all the IPv6 devices support this generalized\n   UDP source port extension\
    \ except for Relay3.  Relay1 is the only\n   relay agent device that uses a non-DHCP\
    \ UDP port (not 547).  Relay2\n   is the upstream device of Relay1.\n   Both Relay1\
    \ and Relay2 include the \"Relay Source Port Option\" in the\n   Relay-forward\
    \ message.  Relay1 sets the \"Downstream Source Port\"\n   field in the option\
    \ to zero.  Relay2 notices that the \"Relay Source\n   Port Option\" is included\
    \ in the message from Relay1, and it\n   determines that the UDP source port used\
    \ by Relay1 is 1000.  Relay2\n   will include the \"Relay Source Port Option\"\
    , and it sets the\n   \"Downstream Source Port\" field in the option to 1000.\
    \  The IPv6\n   server copies the \"Relay Source Port Option\" when replying with\
    \ the\n   Relay-reply message.\n   When Relay2 receives the Relay-reply message\
    \ with the \"Relay Source\n   Port Option\", it finds that the \"Downstream Source\
    \ Port\" field has\n   the value of 1000.  Relay2 then uses this port number in\
    \ the UDP\n   packet when sending the Relay-reply message to Relay1.\n   When\
    \ Relay1 receives the Relay-reply message with the \"Relay Source\n   Port Option\"\
    , it finds that the \"Downstream Source Port\" field has\n   the value of zero.\
    \  Relay1 then uses the normal IPv6 port 547 in the\n   packet sending the Relay-reply\
    \ message to its downstream relay agent\n   or uses UDP port 546 to an IPv6 client.\n\
    \   This DHCP extension works with any combination of IPv6-cascaded relay\n  \
    \ agents, as long as the relay agent that uses a non-DHCP UDP port (not\n   547)\
    \ and its upstream relay device support this generalized UDP\n   source port extension.\n\
    \   Similar to the above example, but now assume that Relay2 uses the UDP\n  \
    \ source port of 2000 instead of 547 as in the diagram.  The Relay3\n   device\
    \ needs to support this DHCP extension and it will set 2000 in\n   its \"Downstream\
    \ Source Port\" field of the option in the Relay-forward\n   message.  When the\
    \ DHCP server sends the DHCP Relay-reply to Relay3,\n   Relay3 finds that its\
    \ own relay option has this \"Downstream Source\n   Port\" with the value of 2000.\
    \  Relay3 will use this UDP port when\n   sending the Relay-reply message to Relay2.\
    \  Relay2 finds its own\n   relay option also has this \"Downstream Source Port\"\
    \ with the value of\n   1000.  Relay2 will use this UDP port when sending the\
    \ Relay-reply\n   message to Relay1.\n"
