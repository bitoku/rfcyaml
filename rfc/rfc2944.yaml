  contents:
  - "2. Command Meanings\n   IAC SB AUTHENTICATION IS <authentication-type-pair> AUTH\
    \ IAC SE\n      This command indicates that the client has supplied the\n    \
    \  username and is ready to receive that user's field parameters.\n      There\
    \ is no authentication information to be sent to the remote\n      side of the\
    \ connection yet.  This should only be sent after the\n      IAC SB AUTHENTICATION\
    \ NAME command has been issued.  If the\n      modifier byte (second byte of the\
    \ authentication-type-pair)\n      has any bits other than AUTH_WHO_MASK or AUTH_HOW_MASK\
    \ set,\n      both bytes are included in the session key hash described later.\n\
    \      This ensures that the authentication type pair was correctly\n      negotiated,\
    \ while maintaining backward-compatibility with existing\n      software.\n  \
    \ IAC SB AUTHENTICATION REPLY <authentication-type-pair> PARAMS <values\n   of\
    \ modulus, generator, and salt> IAC SE\n      This command is used to pass the\
    \ three parameter values used\n      in the exponentiation to the client.  These\
    \ values are often\n      called n, g, and s.\n   IAC SB AUTHENTICATION IS <authentication-type-pair>\
    \ EXP <client's\n   exponential residue> IAC SE\n      This command is used to\
    \ pass the client's exponential residue,\n      otherwise known as A, computed\
    \ against the parameters exchanged\n      earlier.\n   IAC SB AUTHENTICATION REPLY\
    \ <authentication-type-pair> CHALLENGE\n   <server's exponential residue> IAC\
    \ SE\n      This command is used to pass the server's exponential residue,\n \
    \     computed against the same parameters.  This quantity is actually\n     \
    \ the sum of two residues, i.e. g^x + g^b.  For details see [SRP]\n      and [RFC2945].\n\
    \   IAC SB AUTHENTICATION IS <authentication-type-pair> RESPONSE\n   <response\
    \ from client> IAC SE\n      This command gives the server proof of the client's\
    \ authenticity\n      with a 160-bit (20 byte) response.\n   IAC SB AUTHENTICATION\
    \ REPLY <authentication-type-pair> ACCEPT\n   <server's response> IAC SE\n   \
    \   This command indicates that the authentication was successful.\n      The\
    \ server will construct its own proof of authenticity and\n      include it as\
    \ sub-option data.\n   IAC SB AUTHENTICATION REPLY <authentication-type-pair>\
    \ REJECT\n   <optional reason for rejection> IAC SE\n      This command indicates\
    \ that the authentication was not successful,\n      and if there is any more\
    \ data in the sub-option, it is an ASCII\n      text message of the reason for\
    \ the rejection.\n   For the PARAMS command, since three pieces of data are being\n\
    \   transmitted, each parameter is preceded by a 16-bit (two byte) length\n  \
    \ specifier in network byte order.  The EXP commands do not have a\n   count in\
    \ front of the data because there is only one piece of data in\n   that suboption.\
    \  The CHALLENGE, RESPONSE, and ACCEPT data also do not\n   have a count because\
    \ they are all fixed in size.\n"
- title: 3. Implementation Rules
  contents:
  - "3. Implementation Rules\n   Currently, only AUTH_CLIENT_TO_SERVER mode is supported.\
    \  Although\n   the SRP protocol effectively performs implicit mutual authentication\n\
    \   as a result of the two-way proofs, only the AUTH_HOW_ONE_WAY\n   authentication\
    \ mode is currently defined.  The AUTH_HOW_MUTUAL\n   setting is being reserved\
    \ for an explicit mutual-authentication\n   variant of the SRP protocol to be\
    \ defined in future specifications.\n   All large number data sent in the arguments\
    \ of the PARAMS and EXP\n   commands must be in network byte order, i.e. most\
    \ significant byte\n   first.  No padding is used.\n   The SRP-SHA1 mechanism,\
    \ as described in [RFC2945] generates a 40-byte\n   session key, which allows\
    \ implementations to use different keys for\n   incoming and outgoing traffic,\
    \ increasing the security of the\n   encrypted session.  It is recommended that\
    \ the Telnet ENCRYPT method,\n   if it is used, be able to take advantage of the\
    \ longer session keys.\n"

- title: 5. Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "5. Security Considerations\n   The ability to negotiate a common authentication\
    \ mechanism between\n   client and server is a feature of the authentication option\
    \ that\n   should be used with caution.  When the negotiation is performed, no\n\
    \   authentication has yet occurred.  Therefore, each system has no way\n   of\
    \ knowing whether or not it is talking to the system it intends.  An\n   intruder\
    \ could attempt to negotiate the use of an authentication\n   system which is\
    \ either weak, or already compromised by the intruder.\n   Since SRP relies on\
    \ the security of the underlying public-key\n   cryptosystem, the modulus \"n\"\
    \ should be large enough to resist\n   brute-force attack.  A length of at least\
    \ 1024 bits is recommended,\n   and implementations should reject attempts to\
    \ use moduli that are\n   shorter than 512 bits, or attempts to use invalid moduli\
    \ and\n   generator parameters (non-safe-prime \"n\" or non-primitive \"g\").\n"

  - "6. IANA Considerations\n   The authentication type SRP and its associated suboption\
    \ values are\n   registered with IANA.  Any suboption values used to extend the\n\
    \   protocol as described in this document must be registered with IANA\n   before\
    \ use.  IANA is instructed not to issue new suboption values\n   without submission\
    \ of documentation of their use.\n"
