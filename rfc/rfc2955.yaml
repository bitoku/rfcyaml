- title: 1.  The SNMP Management Framework
  contents:
  - "1.  The SNMP Management Framework\n   The SNMP Management Framework presently\
    \ consists of five major\n   components:\n   o  An overall architecture, described\
    \ in RFC 2571 [1].\n   o  Mechanisms for describing and naming objects and events\
    \ for the\n      purpose of management.  The first version of this Structure of\n\
    \      Management Information (SMI) is called SMIv1 and described in STD\n   \
    \   16, RFC 1155 [2], STD 16, RFC 1212 [3] and RFC 1215 [4].  The\n      second\
    \ version, called SMIv2, is described in STD 58, RFC 2578\n      [5], STD 58,\
    \ RFC 2579 [6] and STD 58, RFC 2580 [7].\n   o  Message protocols for transferring\
    \ management information.  The\n      first version of the SNMP message protocol\
    \ is called SNMPv1 and\n      described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [8].  A second version\
    \ of the SNMP\n      message protocol, which is not an Internet standards track\n\
    \      protocol, is called SNMPv2c and described in RFC 1901 [9] and RFC\n   \
    \   1906 [10].  The third version of the message protocol is called\n      SNMPv3\
    \ and described in RFC 1906 [10], RFC 2572 [11] and RFC 2574\n      [12].\n  \
    \ o  Protocol operations for accessing management information.  The\n      first\
    \ set of protocol operations and associated PDU formats is\n      described in\
    \ STD 15, RFC 1157 [8].  A second set of protocol\n      operations and associated\
    \ PDU formats is described in RFC 1905\n      [13].\n   o  A set of fundamental\
    \ applications described in RFC 2573 [14] and\n      the view-based access control\
    \ mechanism described in RFC 2575\n      [15].\n   A more detailed introduction\
    \ to the current SNMP Management Framework\n   can be found in RFC 2570 [16].\n\
    \   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed\n   the\
    \ Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are\n   defined using\
    \ the mechanisms defined in the SMI.\n   This memo specifies a MIB module that\
    \ is compliant to the SMIv2.  A\n   MIB conforming to the SMIv1 can be produced\
    \ through the appropriate\n   translations.  The resulting translated MIB must\
    \ be semantically\n   equivalent, except where objects or events are omitted because\
    \ no\n   translation is possible (use of Counter64).  Some machine readable\n\
    \   information in SMIv2 will be converted into textual descriptions in\n   SMIv1\
    \ during the translation process.  However, this loss of machine\n   readable\
    \ information is not considered to change the semantics of the\n   MIB.\n"

- title: 3.1.  Frame Relay/ATM Service Interworking Background
  contents:
  - "3.1.  Frame Relay/ATM Service Interworking Background\n   Frame relay to ATM\
    \ interworking is a function that exchanges Protocol\n   Data Units (PDU) between\
    \ a frame relay service user and an ATM\n   service user. Two types of interworking\
    \ functions are specified for\n   frame relay and ATM permanent virtual connection\
    \ (PVC) service users:\n   network interworking and service interworking.\n  \
    \ Network interworking provides PDU forwarding between frame relay\n   service\
    \ users inter-connected by an ATM service. Both endpoints are\n   frame relay\
    \ PVCs. Frame Relay to ATM PVC Network Interworking is\n   defined in [20].\n\
    \   Service interworking provides PDU forwarding so that the ATM service\n   user\
    \ performs no frame relaying service-specific functions and the\n   frame relay\
    \ service user performs no ATM service-specific functions.\n   Optionally, the\
    \ service IWF translates particular higher layer\n   protocols to satisfy the\
    \ requirements of end-systems.  Frame Relay to\n   ATM PVC Service Interworking\
    \ is defined in [17].\n   This MIB describes management objects used to provision,\
    \ monitor, and\n   control a Frame Relay/ATM PVC Service IWF.\n   FRF.8 [17] does\
    \ not address point-to-multipoint applications of the\n   IWF.  Implementations\
    \ MAY provide support for point-to-multipoint\n   capability using this MIB.\n\
    \   Consult FRF.8 [17] for more details on the operation of a Frame\n   Relay/ATM\
    \ PVC Service IWF.\n"
- title: 3.2.  Structure of the MIB
  contents:
  - "3.2.  Structure of the MIB\n   The Frame Relay/ATM PVC Service IWF managed objects\
    \ are organized as\n   follows:\n   (1) FR/ATM PVC Service IWF cross-connect table,\n\
    \   (2) Connection description table, and\n   (3) Notification object\n   The\
    \ IWF cross-connect table contains one or more rows for each\n   inter-worked\
    \ connection.  Each inter-worked connection is uniquely\n   identified by the\
    \ frAtmIwfConnIndex object. In the case of point-to-\n   point, a single row is\
    \ present.  In the case of point-to-multipoint,\n   one row exists for each multipoint\
    \ destination.  Index objects for\n   the ATM port, VPI, VCI, frame relay port,\
    \ and frame relay DLCI\n   distinguish the constituent rows used in a point-to-multipoint\
    \ case.\n   Each inter-worked connection has attributes governing behavior of\
    \ the\n   IWF.  These attributes describe how the IWF should transform a PDU\n\
    \   during the forwarding process and provide rules for:\n   (1) Mapping the ATM\
    \ CLP bit to frame relay DE bit\n   (2) Mapping the ATM congestion notification\
    \ bit to frame relay\n       congestion bits\n   (3) Mapping higher protocol encapsulations\
    \ between ATM and frame\n       relay\n   (4) Performing fragmentation and reassembly\n\
    \   (5) Performing ARP translation between ATM and frame relay\n   Typically,\
    \ most connections share the same attributes.  The\n   attributes are represented\
    \ in this MIB by the connection description\n   table.  Each row of the connection\
    \ description table contains the\n   attribute settings common to one or more\
    \ inter-worked connections.\n   One example would be full mapping and translation.\
    \  All cross-connect\n   table entries that require full mapping and translation\
    \ services set\n   the frAtmIwfConnectionDescriptor object to the index value\
    \ for the\n   connection description table row that contains objects set to values\n\
    \   that provide full mapping and translation services.\n   A notification object\
    \ provides cross-connect status change alerts.\n"

  - "3.3.  Relationship to Other MIBs\n   The Frame Relay/ATM PVC Service IWF MIB\
    \ describes the cross-\n   connections between frame relay and ATM service users.\
    \  Each PVC\n   endpoint is provisioned and managed with a technology-specific\
    \ MIB as\n   described below.\n   Each technology-specific MIB has a table of\
    \ PVC endpoints (indexed by\n   ifIndex and logical link address such as the DLCI\
    \ or VPI/VCI).  In\n   the absence of interworking, two endpoints are cross-connected\
    \ via a\n   technology-specific cross connect table (e.g., the\n   atmVcCrossConnectTable\
    \ in the ATM MIB).  However, a connection\n   between a frame relay endpoint and\
    \ an ATM endpoint requires a cross-\n   connect in the ATM IWF MIB.\n   The following\
    \ sections describe the relationship between the\n   technology-specific MIBs\

    \   Step 1 - Create the frame relay PVC endpoint\n   a) Manager requests creation\
    \ of a new row in the frPVCEndptTable\n   b) Agent receives management request\

    \      -  remaining row objects initialized as needed for DLCI X on\n        \
    \ ifIndex Y\n   Step 2 - Create the ATM PVC endpoint\n   a) Agent receives management\
    \ request to create a row in atmVclTable\n      for the ATM side\n   b) A new\
    \ row is created in atmVclTable and frAtmIwfVclTable (the\n      AUGMENT to the\

    \ connection descriptor\n   a) If an existing connection descriptor is appropriate\
    \ for the new\n      connection, go to Step 4 using the selected connection descriptor\n\
    \      index value L\n   b) Manager requests a new connection descriptor index\
    \ value by\n      reading frAtmIwfConnectionDescriptorIndexNext from the agent\n\
    \   c) Agent receives GET request for\n      frAtmIwfConnectionDescriptorIndexNext\

    \ a new connection descriptor row entry using the\n      value L as the index\n\
    \   e) Agent receives SET request to create the\n      frAtmIwfConnectionDescriptorTable\
    \ row entry causes the system to\n      create a row in the table.\n   Step 4\
    \ - Create the FR/ATM cross-connect\n   a) Manager requests a new cross-connect\
    \ index value by reading\n      frAtmIwfConnIndexNext from the agent\n   b) Agent\
    \ receives GET request for frAtmIwfConnIndexNext and responds\n      with the\
    \ next available value K\n   c) Manager requests a new cross-connect row entry\
    \ using the value K\n      as the index\n   d) Agent receives SET request to create\

    \ PVC endpoints MUST exist\n      and be specified as part of the index fields\

    \   -  frAtmIwfConnectionDescriptor of L\n   Step 5 - The system sets the frame\
    \ relay PVC endpoint and ATM VCL\n   endpoint to point to the FR/ATM cross-connect\
    \ row (as a side-effect\n   of Step 4).\n   a) System sets frPVCEndptAtmIwfConnIndex\

    \ Manager signals activation by issuing a SET for the\n   frAtmIwfConnAdminStatus\

    \ frAtmIwfConnAdminStatus and\n   executes internal system mechanisms to activate\
    \ each PVC segment and\n   the IWF cross-connect. The successful activation permits\
    \ the agent to\n   respond with 'up(1)' when a GET request is received for the\

- title: 10.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "10.  Security Considerations\n   There are a number of management objects defined\
    \ in this MIB that\n   have a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.\
    \  Such\n   objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network\n\
    \   environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure\n   environment\
    \ without proper protection can have a negative effect on\n   network operations.\n\
    \   No managed objects in this MIB contain sensitive information.\n   SNMPv1 by\
    \ itself is not a secure environment.  Even if the network\n   itself is secure\
    \ (for example by using IPSec), even then, there is no\n   control as to who on\
    \ the secure network is allowed to access and\n   GET/SET (read/change/create/delete)\
    \ the objects in this MIB.\n   It is recommended that the implementers consider\
    \ the security\n   features as provided by the SNMPv3 framework.  Specifically,\
    \ the use\n   of the User-based Security Model RFC 2574 [12] and the View-based\n\
    \   Access Control Model RFC 2575 [15] is recommended.\n   It is then a customer/user\
    \ responsibility to ensure that the SNMP\n   entity giving access to an instance\
    \ of this MIB, is properly\n   configured to give access to the objects only to\
    \ those principals\n   (users) that have legitimate rights to indeed GET or SET\n\
    \   (change/create/delete) them.\n"
