  - "Abstract\n   Management of name servers for the Domain Name System (DNS) has\n\
    \   traditionally been done using vendor-specific monitoring,\n   configuration,\
    \ and control methods.  Although some service monitoring\n   platforms can test\
    \ the functionality of the DNS itself, there is not\n   an interoperable way to\
    \ manage (monitor, control, and configure) the\n   internal aspects of a name\
    \ server itself.\n   This document discusses the requirements of a management\
    \ system for\n   name servers and can be used as a shopping list of needed features\n\
    \   for such a system.\n"

  - "1.  Introduction\n   Management of name servers for the Domain Name System (DNS)\
    \ [RFC1034]\n   [RFC1035] has traditionally been done using vendor-specific\n\
    \   monitoring, configuration, and control methods.  Although some\n   service\
    \ monitoring platforms can test the functionality of the DNS\n   itself, there\
    \ is not an interoperable way to manage (monitor,\n   control, and configure)\
    \ the internal aspects of a name server itself.\n   Previous standardization work\
    \ within the IETF resulted in the\n   creation of two SNMP MIB modules [RFC1611]\
    \ [RFC1612], but they failed\n   to achieve significant implementation and deployment.\
    \  The perceived\n   reasons behind the failure for the two MIB modules are documented\
    \ in\n   [RFC3197].\n   This document discusses the requirements of a management\
    \ system for\n   name servers and can be used as a shopping list of needed features\n\
    \   for such a system.  This document only discusses requirements for\n   managing\
    \ the name server component of a system -- not other elements\n   of the system\
    \ itself.\n   Specifically out of scope for this document are requirements\n \
    \  associated with the management of stub resolvers.  It is not the\n   intent\
    \ of this document to document stub resolver requirements,\n   although some of\
    \ the requirements listed are applicable to stub\n   resolvers as well.\n   The\
    \ task of creating a management system for managing DNS servers is\n   not expected\
    \ to be a small one.  It is likely that components of the\n   solution will need\
    \ to be designed in parts over time; these\n   requirements take this into consideration.\
    \  In particular,\n   Section 5.1 discusses the need for future extensibility\
    \ of the base\n   management solution.  This document is intended to be a roadmap\n\
    \   towards a desired outcome and is not intended to define an \"all-or-\n   nothing\"\
    \ system.  Successful interoperable management of name\n   servers, even in part,\
    \ is expected to be beneficial to network\n   operators compared to the entirely\
    \ custom solutions that are used at\n   the time of this writing.\n"

    , \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"\
    MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n   document are to be interpreted as described\
    \ in [RFC2119].\n"
- title: 1.2.  Terminology
  contents:
  - "1.2.  Terminology\n   This document is consistent with the terminology defined\
    \ in Section 2\n   of [RFC4033].  Additional terminology needed for this document\
    \ is\n   described below:\n   Name Server:  When we are discussing servers that\
    \ don't fall into a\n      more specific type of server category defined in other\
    \ documents,\n      this document will refer to them generically as \"name servers\"\
    .\n      In particular, \"name servers\" can be considered to be any valid\n \
    \     combination of authoritative, recursive, validating, or security-\n    \
    \  aware.  The more specific name server labels will be used when\n      this\
    \ document refers only to a specific type of server.  However,\n      the term\
    \ \"name server\", in this document, will not include stub\n      resolvers.\n"
- title: 1.3.  Document Layout and Requirements
  contents:
  - "1.3.  Document Layout and Requirements\n   This document is written so that each\
    \ numbered section will contain\n   only a single requirement if it contains one\
    \ at all.  Each\n   requirement will contain needed wording from the terminology\n\
    \   described in Section 1.1.  Subsections, however, might exist with\n   additional\
    \ related requirements.  The document is laid out in this\n   way so that a specific\
    \ requirement can be uniquely referred to using\n   the section number itself\
    \ and the document version from which it\n   came.\n"
- title: 2.  Management Architecture Requirements
  contents:
  - "2.  Management Architecture Requirements\n   This section discusses requirements\
    \ that reflect the needs of the\n   expected deployment environments.\n"
- title: 2.1.  Expected Deployment Scenarios
  contents:
  - "2.1.  Expected Deployment Scenarios\n   DNS zones vary greatly in the type of\
    \ content published within them.\n   Name servers, too, are deployed with a wide\
    \ variety of configurations\n   to support the diversity of the deployed content.\
    \  It is important\n   that a management solution trying to meet the criteria\
    \ specified in\n   this document consider supporting the largest number of potential\n\
    \   deployment cases as possible.  Further deployment scenarios that are\n   not\
    \ used as direct examples of specific requirements are listed in\n   Appendix\
    \ A.\n"
- title: 2.1.1.  Zone Size Constraints
  contents:
  - "2.1.1.  Zone Size Constraints\n   The management solution MUST support both name\
    \ servers that are\n   serving a small number of potentially very large zones\
    \ (e.g., Top\n   Level Domains (TLDs)) as well as name servers that are serving\
    \ a very\n   large number of small zones.  Both deployment scenarios are common.\n"
- title: 2.1.2.  Name Server Discovery
  contents:
  - "2.1.2.  Name Server Discovery\n   Large enterprise network deployments may contain\
    \ multiple name\n   servers operating within the boundaries of the enterprise\
    \ network.\n   These name servers may each be serving multiple zones both in and\
    \ out\n   of the parent enterprise's zone.  Finding and managing large numbers\n\
    \   of name servers would be a useful feature of the resulting management\n  \
    \ solution.  The management solution MAY support the ability to\n   discover previously\
    \ unknown instances of name servers operating\n   within a deployed network.\n"
- title: 2.1.3.  Configuration Data Volatility
  contents:
  - "2.1.3.  Configuration Data Volatility\n   Configuration data is defined as data\
    \ that relates only to the\n   configuration of a server and the zones it serves.\
    \  It specifically\n   does not include data from the zone contents that is served\
    \ through\n   DNS itself.  The solution MUST support servers that remain statically\n\
    \   configured over time as well as servers that have numerous zones\n   being\
    \ added and removed within an hour.  Both deployment scenarios\n   are common.\n"
- title: 2.1.4.  Protocol Selection
  contents:
  - "2.1.4.  Protocol Selection\n   There are many requirements in this document for\
    \ many different types\n   of management operations (see Section 3 for further\
    \ details).  It is\n   possible that no one protocol will ideally fill all the\
    \ needs of the\n   requirements listed in this document, and thus multiple protocols\n\
    \   might be needed to produce a completely functional management system.\n  \
    \ Multiple protocols might be used to create the complete management\n   solution,\
    \ but the solution SHOULD require only one.\n"
- title: 2.1.5.  Common Data Model
  contents:
  - "2.1.5.  Common Data Model\n   Defining a standardized protocol (or set of protocols)\
    \ to use for\n   managing name servers would be a step forward in achieving an\n\
    \   interoperable management solution.  However, just defining a protocol\n  \
    \ to use by itself would not achieve the entire end goal of a complete\n   interoperable\
    \ management solution.  Devices also need to represent\n   their internal management\
    \ interface using a common management data\n   model.  The solution MUST create\
    \ a common data model that management\n   stations can make use of when sending\
    \ or collecting data from a\n   managed device so it can successfully manage equipment\
    \ from vendors\n   as if they were generic DNS servers.  This common data model\
    \ is\n   needed for the operations discussion in Section 3.  Note that this\n\
    \   does not preclude the fact that name server vendors might provide\n   additional\
    \ management infrastructure beyond a base management\n   specification, as discussed\
    \ further in Section 5.1.\n"
- title: 2.1.6.  Operational Impact
  contents:
  - "2.1.6.  Operational Impact\n   It is impossible to add new features to an existing\
    \ server (such as\n   the inclusion of a management infrastructure) and not impact\
    \ the\n   existing service and/or server in some fashion.  At a minimum, for\n\
    \   example, more memory, disk, and/or CPU resources will be required to\n   implement\
    \ a new management system.  However, the impact to the\n   existing DNS service\
    \ MUST be minimized since the DNS service itself\n   is still the primary service\
    \ to be offered by the modified name\n   server.  The management solution MUST\
    \ NOT result in an increase of\n   the number of unhandled DNS requests.\n"
- title: 2.2.  Name Server Types
  contents:
  - "2.2.  Name Server Types\n   There are multiple ways in which name servers can\
    \ be deployed.  Name\n   servers can take on any of the following roles:\n   o\
    \  Master Servers\n   o  Slave Servers\n   o  Recursive Servers\n   The management\
    \ solution SHOULD support all of these types of name\n   servers as they are all\
    \ equally important.  Note that \"Recursive\n   Servers\" can be further broken\
    \ down by the security sub-roles they\n   might implement, as defined in section\
    \ 2 of [RFC4033].  These sub-\n   roles are also important to support within any\
    \ management solution.\n   As stated earlier, the management of stub resolvers\
    \ is considered out\n   of scope for this document.\n"
- title: 3.  Management Operation Types
  contents:
  - "3.  Management Operation Types\n   Management operations can traditionally be\
    \ broken into four\n   categories:\n   o  Control\n   o  Configuration\n   o \
    \ Health and Monitoring\n   o  Alarms and Events\n   This section discusses detailed\
    \ requirements for each of these four\n   management categories.\n"
- title: 3.1.  Control Requirements
  contents:
  - "3.1.  Control Requirements\n   The management solution MUST be capable of performing\
    \ basic service\n   control operations.\n"
- title: 3.1.1.  Needed Control Operations
  contents:
  - "3.1.1.  Needed Control Operations\n   These operations SHOULD include, at a minimum,\
    \ the following\n   operations:\n   o  Starting the name server\n   o  Reloading\
    \ the service configuration\n   o  Reloading all of the zone data\n   o  Reloading\
    \ individual zone data sets\n   o  Restarting the name server\n   o  Stopping\
    \ the name server\n   Note that no restriction is placed on how the management\
    \ system\n   implements these operations.  In particular, at least \"starting\
    \ the\n   name server\" will require a minimal management system component to\n\
    \   exist independently of the name server itself.\n"
- title: 3.1.2.  Asynchronous Status Notifications
  contents:
  - "3.1.2.  Asynchronous Status Notifications\n   Some control operations might take\
    \ a long time to complete.  As an\n   example, some name servers take a long time\
    \ to perform reloads of\n   large zones.  Because of these timing issues, the\
    \ management solution\n   SHOULD take this into consideration and offer a mechanism\
    \ to ease the\n   burden associated with awaiting the status of a long-running\
    \ command.\n   This could, for example, result in the use of asynchronous\n  \
    \ notifications for returning the status of a long-running task, or it\n   might\
    \ require the management station to poll for the status of a\n   given task using\
    \ monitoring commands.  These and other potential\n   solutions need to be evaluated\
    \ carefully to select one that balances\n   the result delivery needs with the\
    \ perceived implementation costs.\n   Also, see the related discussion in Section\
    \ 3.4 on notification\n   messages for supporting delivery of alarm and event\
    \ messages.\n"
- title: 3.2.  Configuration Requirements
  contents:
  - "3.2.  Configuration Requirements\n   Many features of name servers need to be\
    \ configured before the server\n   can be considered functional.  The management\
    \ solution MUST be able\n   to provide name servers with configuration data. \
    \ The most important\n   data to be configured, for example, is the served zone\
    \ data itself.\n"
- title: 3.2.1.  Served Zone Modification
  contents:
  - "3.2.1.  Served Zone Modification\n   The ability to add, modify, and delete zones\
    \ being served by name\n   servers is needed.  Although there are already solutions\
    \ for zone\n   content modification (such as Dynamic DNS (DDNS) [RFC2136] [RFC3007],\n\
    \   full zone transfer (AXFR) [RFC5936], and incremental zone transfer\n   (IXFR)\
    \ [RFC1995]) that might be used as part of the final management\n   solution,\
    \ the management system SHOULD still be able to create a new\n   zone (with enough\
    \ minimal data to allow the other mechanisms to\n   function as well) and to delete\
    \ a zone.  This might be, for example,\n   a management operation that allows\
    \ for the creation of at least the\n   initial SOA (Start of Authority) record\
    \ for a new zone, since that is\n   the minimum amount of zone data needed for\
    \ the other operations to\n   function.\n"
- title: 3.2.2.  Trust Anchor Management
  contents:
  - "3.2.2.  Trust Anchor Management\n   The solution SHOULD support the ability to\
    \ add, modify, and delete\n   trust anchors that are used by DNS Security (DNSSEC)\
    \ [RFC4033]\n   [RFC4034] [RFC4035] [RFC4509] [RFC5011] [RFC5155].  These trust\n\
    \   anchors might be configured using the data from the DNSKEY Resource\n   Records\
    \ (RRs) themselves or by using Delegation Signer (DS)\n   fingerprints.\n"
- title: 3.2.3.  Security Expectations
  contents:
  - "3.2.3.  Security Expectations\n   DNSSEC validating resolvers need to make policy\
    \ decisions about the\n   requests being processed.  For example, they need to\
    \ be configured\n   with a list of zones expected to be secured by DNSSEC.  The\n\
    \   management solution SHOULD be able to add, modify, and delete\n   attributes\
    \ of DNSSEC security policies.\n"
- title: 3.2.4.  TSIG Key Management
  contents:
  - "3.2.4.  TSIG Key Management\n   TSIG [RFC2845] allows transaction-level authentication\
    \ of DNS\n   traffic.  The management solution SHOULD be able to add, modify,\
    \ and\n   delete TSIG keys known to the name server.\n"
- title: 3.2.5.  DNS Protocol Authorization Management
  contents:
  - "3.2.5.  DNS Protocol Authorization Management\n   The management solution SHOULD\
    \ have the ability to add, modify, and\n   delete authorization settings for the\
    \ DNS protocols itself.  Do not\n   confuse this with the ability to manage the\
    \ authorization associated\n   with the management protocol itself, which is discussed\
    \ later in\n   Section 4.4.  There are a number of authorization settings that\
    \ are\n   used by a name server.  Example authorization settings that the\n  \
    \ solution might need to cover are:\n   o  Access to operations on zone data (e.g.,\
    \ DDNS)\n   o  Access to certain zone data from certain sources (e.g., from\n\
    \      particular network subnets)\n   o  Access to specific DNS protocol services\
    \ (e.g., recursive service)\n   Note: the above list is expected to be used as\
    \ a collection of\n   examples and is not a complete list of needed authorization\n\
    \   protections.\n"
- title: 3.3.  Monitoring Requirements
  contents:
  - "3.3.  Monitoring Requirements\n   Monitoring is the process of collecting aspects\
    \ of the internal state\n   of a name server at a given moment in time.  The solution\
    \ MUST be\n   able to monitor the health of a name server to determine its\n \
    \  operational status, load, and other internal attributes.  Example\n   parameters\

    \   o  List of zones being served\n   o  Detailed statistics about clients interacting\

    \ trigger alarm notifications\n   can quickly inform a management station about\
    \ critical issues.  A\n   management solution SHOULD include support for delivery\
    \ of alarm\n   conditions.\n   Example alarm conditions might include:\n   o \
    \ The server's status is changing (e.g., it is starting up,\n      reloading configuration,\
    \ restarting or shutting down).\n   o  A needed resource (e.g., memory or disk\

- title: 4.4.  Authorization
  contents:
  - "4.4.  Authorization\n   The solution SHOULD provide an authorization model capable\
    \ of\n   selectively authorizing individual management requests for any\n   management\
    \ protocols it introduces to the completed system.  This\n   authorization differs\
    \ from the authorization previously discussed in\n   Section 3.2.5 in that this\
    \ requirement is concerned solely with\n   authorization of the management system\
    \ itself.\n   There are a number of authorization settings that might be used\
    \ by a\n   managed system to determine whether the managing entity has\n   authorization\
    \ to perform the given management task.  Example\n   authorization settings that\
    \ the solution might need to cover are:\n   o  Access to the configuration that\
    \ specifies which zones are to be\n      served\n   o  Access to the management\
    \ system infrastructure\n   o  Access to other control operations\n   o  Access\
    \ to other configuration operations\n   o  Access to monitoring operations\n \

    \ risks introduced to the\n   complete name server system.  It is impossible to\
    \ add new\n   infrastructure to a server and not impact the security in some\n\
    \   fashion as the introduction of a management protocol alone will\n   provide\
    \ a new avenue for potential attack.  Although the added\n   management benefits\
    \ will be worth the increased risks, the solution\n   still needs to minimize\

    \ the\n   solution MUST be flexible and able to accommodate new future\n   management\
    \ operations.  The solution might, for example, make use of\n   protocol versioning\
    \ or capability description exchanges to ensure\n   that management stations and\

- title: A.1.  Non-Standard Zones
  contents:
  - "A.1.  Non-Standard Zones\n   If an organization uses non-standard zones (for\
    \ example a purely\n   local TLD), synchronizing all the name servers for these\
    \ zones is\n   usually a time-consuming task.  It is made worse when two\n   organizations\
    \ with conflicting zones merge.  This situation is not a\n   recommended deployment\
    \ scenario (and is even heavily discouraged),\n   but it is, unfortunately, seen\
    \ in the wild.\n   It is typically implemented using \"forwarding\" zones.  But\
    \ there is\n   no way to ensure automatically that all the resolvers have the\
    \ same\n   set of zones to forward at any given time.  New zones might be added\n\
    \   to a local forwarding recursive server, for example, without\n   modifying\
    \ the rest of the deployed forwarding servers.  It is hoped\n   that a management\
    \ solution that could handle the configuration of\n   zone forwarding would finally\
    \ allow management of servers deployed in\n   this fashion.\n"
- title: A.2.  Redundancy Sharing
  contents:
  - "A.2.  Redundancy Sharing\n   For reliability reasons, it is recommended that\
    \ zone operators follow\n   the guidelines documented in [RFC2182], which recommends\
    \ that\n   multiple name servers be configured for each zone and that the name\n\
    \   servers be separated both physically and via connectivity routes.  A\n   common\
    \ solution is to establish DNS-serving partnerships: \"I'll host\n   your zones\
    \ and you'll host mine\".  Both entities benefit from\n   increased DNS reliability\
    \ via the wider service distribution.  This\n   frequently occurs between cooperating\
    \ but otherwise unrelated\n   entities (such as between two distinct companies)\
    \ as well as between\n   affiliated organizations (such as between branch offices\
    \ within a\n   single company).\n   The configuration of these relationships are\
    \ currently required to be\n   manually configured and maintained.  Changes to\
    \ the list of zones\n   that are cross-hosted are manually negotiated between\
    \ the cooperating\n   network administrators and configured by hand.  A management\
    \ protocol\n   with the ability to provide selective authorization, as discussed\
    \ in\n   Section 4.4, would solve many of the management difficulties between\n\
    \   cooperating organizations.\n"

    \   strategies.\n      All contents and DNSSEC keying information controlled and\

    \ and operated\n      by a third organization.\n   Although this list is not exhaustive\

    \ to illustrate the\n   potential ways in which zone data can be controlled by\
    \ multiple\n   entities.\n   The end result of all of these strategies, however,\
    \ will be the same:\n   a live zone containing DNSSEC-related resource records.\
    \  Many of the\n   above strategies are merely different ways of preparing a zone\
