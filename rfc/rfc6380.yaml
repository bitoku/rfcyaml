  - "Abstract\n   The United States Government has published guidelines for \"NSA\n\
    \   Suite B Cryptography\" dated July, 2005, which defines cryptographic\n   algorithm\
    \ policy for national security applications.  This document\n   specifies the\
    \ conventions for using Suite B cryptography in IP\n   Security (IPsec).\n   Since\
    \ many of the Suite B algorithms are used in other environments,\n   the majority\
    \ of the conventions needed for the Suite B\n   algorithms are already specified\
    \ in other documents.  This document\n   references the source of these conventions,\
    \ with some relevant\n   detail repeated to aid developers who choose to support\

  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   This document specifies the conventions for using NSA Suite\
    \ B\n   Cryptography [SuiteB] in IP Security (IPsec).\n   IP Security (IPsec)\
    \ provides confidentiality, data integrity, access\n   control, and data source\
    \ authentication to IP datagrams.  The\n   Internet Key Exchange (IKE) provides\
    \ an automated key management for\n   IPsec, performing mutual authentication\
    \ between two parties and\n   establishing security associations (SAs) that protects\
    \ both IKE and\n   IPsec communications.  Suite B compliant implementations for\
    \ IPsec\n   MUST use IKEv2 [RFC5996].\n   [RFC6379] defines a set of four cryptographic\
    \ user interface suites\n   for IPsec that are comprised of Suite B algorithms.\
    \  The four suites\n   specify options for IKEv2 and for the IP Encapsulating\
    \ Security\n   Payload (ESP), [RFC4303].  Suite B compliant implementations for\n\
    \   IPsec MUST use one of these four suites depending upon the desired\n   security\
    \ level and security services.\n"

  contents:
  - "3.  Suite B Requirements\n   Suite B requires that key establishment and signature\
    \ algorithms be\n   based upon Elliptic Curve Cryptography and that the encryption\n\
    \   algorithm be AES [FIPS197].  Suite B includes [SuiteB]:\n   Encryption:  \

    \ these DH groups in [IKEV2IANA].\n"
- title: 4.  Minimum Levels of Security (minLOS)
  contents:
  - "4.  Minimum Levels of Security (minLOS)\n   Suite B provides for two levels of\
    \ cryptographic security, namely a\n   128-bit minimum level of security (minLOS_128)\
    \ and a 192-bit minimum\n   level of security (minLOS_192).  Each level defines\

- title: 4.2.  Suite B IPsec Cryptographic Suites
  contents:
  - "4.2.  Suite B IPsec Cryptographic Suites\n   Each system MUST specify a security\

- title: 4.3.  Suite B IKEv2 Authentication
  contents:
  - "4.3.  Suite B IKEv2 Authentication\n   Digital signatures using ECDSA MUST be\
    \ used for authentication by\n   Suite B compliant implementations.  [RFC4754]\
    \ defines two digital\n   signature algorithms: ECDSA-256 and ECDSA-384.  Following\
    \ the\n   direction of RFC 4754, ECDSA-256 represents an instantiation of the\n\
    \   ECDSA algorithm using the P-256 curve and the SHA-256 hash function.\n   ECDSA-384\
    \ represents an instantiation of the ECDSA algorithm using\n   the P-384 curve\
    \ and the SHA-384 hash function.\n   If configured at a minimum level of security\
    \ of 128 bits, a system\n   MUST use either ECDSA-256 or ECDSA-384 for IKE authentication.\
    \  It is\n   allowable for one party to authenticate with ECDSA-256 and the other\n\
    \   party to authenticate with ECDSA-384.  This flexibility will allow\n   interoperability\
    \ between an initiator and a responder that have\n   different sizes of ECDSA\
    \ authentication keys.\n   Initiators and responders in a system configured at\
    \ a minimum level\n   of security of 128 bits MUST be able to verify ECDSA-256\
    \ signatures\n   and SHOULD be able to verify ECDSA-384 signatures.\n   If configured\

    \ parties for IKEv2 authentication.\n   Initiators and responders in a system\
    \ configured at a minimum level\n   of security of 192 bits MUST be able to verify\
    \ ECDSA-384 signatures.\n   For Suite B compliant systems, authentication methods\
    \ other than\n   ECDSA-256 and ECDSA-384 MUST NOT be used for IKEv2 authentication.\n\
    \   If a relying party receives a message signed with any other\n   authentication\
    \ method, it MUST return an AUTHENTICATION_FAILED\n   notification and stop processing\
    \ the message.\n"
- title: 4.4.  Digital Signatures and Certificates
  contents:
  - "4.4.  Digital Signatures and Certificates\n   The initiator and responder, at\

  contents:
  - "5.  Suite B Security Associations (SAs) for IKEv2 and IPsec\n   The four suites\
    \ in [RFC6379] specify options for ESP [RFC4303] and\n   IKEv2 [RFC5996].  The\
    \ four suites are differentiated by cryptographic\n   algorithm strength and a\
    \ choice of whether ESP is to provide both\n   confidentiality and integrity or\
    \ integrity only.  The suite names are\n   based upon the AES mode (\"GCM\" or\
    \ \"GMAC\") and the AES key length\n   specified for ESP (\"128\" or \"256\").\
    \  Suites with \"GCM\" in their name\n   MUST be used when ESP integrity protection\
    \ and encryption are both\n   needed.  Suites with \"GMAC\" in their name MUST\
    \ be used only when\n   there is no need for ESP encryption.\n   An initiator\
    \ in a system configured at a minimum level of security of\n   128 bits MUST offer\
    \ one or more of the four suites: Suite-B-GCM-128,\n   Suite-B-GMAC-128, Suite-B-GCM-256,\

    \ offered, MUST appear in the\n   IKEv2 and IPsec SA payloads before any offerings\
    \ of Suite-B-GCM-256\n   and Suite-B-GMAC-256.\n   A responder in a system configured\
    \ at a minimum level of security of\n   128 bits MUST support one or both of the\

    \ exchange.  If the 256-bit random ECP group\n   for Transform Type 4 is selected,\

- title: 7.  Generating Keying Material for the IKE SA
  contents:
  - "7.  Generating Keying Material for the IKE SA\n   The ECDH shared secret established\
    \ during the key exchange consists\n   of the x value of the ECDH common value\
    \ [RFC5903].  The x value is\n   256 or 384 bits when using the P-256 or P-384\
    \ curve, respectively.\n   IKEv2 [RFC5996] allows for the reuse of Diffie-Hellman\
    \ ephemeral\n   keys.  Section 5.6.4.3 of NIST SP800-56A states that an ephemeral\n\
    \   private key MUST be used in exactly one key establishment transaction\n  \
    \ and MUST be zeroized after its use.  Section 5.8 of SP800-56A states\n   that\
    \ the Diffie-Hellman shared secret MUST be zeroized immediately\n   after its\
    \ use.  Suite B compliant IPsec systems MUST follow the\n   mandates in SP800-56A.\n\
    \   If using PRF-HMAC-SHA-256, SKEYSEED, SK_d, SK_pi, and SK_pr MUST each\n  \

- title: 8.  Additional Requirements
  contents:
  - "8.  Additional Requirements\n   AH is not supported in Suite B compliant implementations.\n\
    \   Per [RFC5996], although ESP does not directly include a Diffie-\n   Hellman\
    \ exchange, a Diffie-Hellman group MAY be negotiated for the\n   Child SA.  This\
    \ allows the peers to employ Diffie-Hellman in the\n   CREATE_CHILD_SA exchange.\
    \  If a transform Type 4 is specified for an\n   SA for ESP, the value of the\
    \ transform MUST match that of the\n   transform used by the IKE SA.\n   Per RFC\
    \ 5996, if a CREATE_CHILD_SA exchange includes a KEi payload,\n   at least one\
    \ of the SA offers MUST include the Diffie-Hellman group\n   of the KEi.  For\
    \ Suite B IPsec compliant implementations, the Diffie-\n   Hellman group of the\
    \ KEi MUST use the same random ECP group used in\n   the IKE_INIT_SA.\n   For\
    \ IKEv2, rekeying of the CREATE_CHILD_SA MUST be supported by both\n   parties.\
    \  The initiator of this exchange MAY include a new Diffie-\n   Hellman key; if\
    \ it is included, it MUST use the same random ECP group\n   used in the IKE_INIT_SA.\
    \  If the initiator of the exchange includes a\n   Diffie-Hellman key, the responder\
    \ MUST include a Diffie-Hellman key,\n   and it MUST use the same random ECP group.\n\
    \   Suite B IPsec compliant systems MUST support IKEv2 and MUST NOT use\n   IKEv1\
    \ between a Suite B compliant initiator and responder.  To\n   accommodate backward\
    \ compatibility, a Suite B IPsec compliant system\n   can be configured to use\
    \ IKEv1 so long as only IKEv2 is used between\n   a Suite B compliant initiator\
    \ and responder.  However, when IKEv1 is\n   being used, the system is not being\
    \ operated in a Suite B compliant\n   mode.\n   IKEv2 does not specify how Identification\
    \ Payloads (IDi and IDr) in\n   the IKE_AUTH exchanges are used for policy lookup.\
    \  For Suite B\n   compliant systems, the IKEv2 authentication method MUST NOT\
    \ use the\n   Identification Payloads for policy lookup.  Instead, the\n   authentication\
    \ method MUST use an end-entity found in the end-entity\n   certificate provided\
    \ by the authenticating party.\n   The administrative user interface (UI) for\
    \ a system that conforms to\n   this profile MUST allow the operator to specify\
    \ a single suite.  If\n   only one suite is specified in the administrative UI,\
    \ the IKEv2\n   implementation MUST only offer algorithms for that one suite.\n\
    \   The administrative UI MAY allow the operator to specify more than one\n  \
    \ suite; if it allows this, it MUST allow the operator to specify a\n   preferred\
    \ order for the suites that are to be offered or accepted.\n   The preferred order\
    \ MUST follow the direction provided in Section 4.\n   If more than one suite\
    \ is specified in the administrative UI, the\n   IKEv2 implementation MUST only\
    \ offer algorithms for those suites.\n"
