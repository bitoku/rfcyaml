  - "1.  Introduction\n   IP packets are often terminated by network devices.  In\
    \ some cases,\n   control-plane packets are terminated and processed by the local\n\
    \   device, while in other cases packets are terminated (discarded) due\n   to\
    \ a packet filtering mechanism.  Packet filtering is widely employed\n   in network\
    \ devices for sanity checking, policy enforcement, and\n   security.  IP routers\
    \ and middleboxes, such as firewalls, often\n   terminate packets that do not\
    \ comply with a predefined policy.\n   Unfortunately, some filtering policies\
    \ cause false positive or\n   unnecessary packet termination.  Moreover, these\
    \ wrongful\n   terminations are sometimes biased and discriminate against packets\n\
    \   based on their color, age, origin, length, or IP version.\n   This memo discusses\
    \ some of the most common scenarios of wrongful\n   termination of IP packets\
    \ and presents recommendations for preventing\n   such discrimination.\n"

- title: 3.1.  Color-Based Termination
  contents:
  - "3.1.  Color-Based Termination\n   Synopsis\n      IP packets are terminated due\
    \ to their color.\n   Description\n      Routers often employ metering mechanisms\
    \ [RFC4115].  These\n      mechanisms often support a color-aware mode, in which\
    \ the packet's\n      color (green, yellow, or red) is used as a criterion in\
    \ the\n      metering algorithm.  This mode has been known to prefer green\n \
    \     packets over red and yellow packets.\n   Recommendation\n      Use of color-blind\
    \ metering is recommended, as it allows equal\n      opportunity for packets of\
    \ different colors.\n"
- title: 3.2.  Age-Based Termination
  contents:
  - "3.2.  Age-Based Termination\n   Synopsis\n      IP packets are terminated based\
    \ on their TTL.\n   Description\n      The IPv4 TTL field [RFC791] and the IPv6\
    \ Hop Limit field [RFC8200]\n      are used for loop prevention.  These fields\
    \ essentially represent\n      the packet's age.  A router that receives an IP\
    \ packet with a TTL\n      value of 0 or 1 typically terminates the packet.  In\
    \ this\n      document, packets with a TTL or Hop Limit of 0 or 1 are referred\n\
    \      to as 'senior packets'.\n   Recommendation\n      When possible, the practice\
    \ of reverse discrimination is\n      recommended.  Notably, senior packets have\
    \ been known to be highly\n      effective for OAM tasks, such as Hello [RFC2328]\
    \ and Traceroute\n      [RFC2151].  Therefore, senior packets should not be easily\n\
    \      dismissed; to the extent possible, senior packets should be used\n    \
    \  in control-plane protocols.\n"
- title: 3.3.  Origin-Based Termination
  contents:
  - "3.3.  Origin-Based Termination\n   Synopsis\n      IP packets are terminated\
    \ based on their origin (source IP address\n      prefix).\n   Description\n \
    \     Routers and middleboxes often perform IP address filtering.\n      Packets\
    \ are often discarded based on the prefix of their source IP\n      address. \
    \ In this memo, prefix-based source address filtering is\n      referred to as\
    \ origin-based filtering.  While source IP address\n      filtering is an acceptable\
    \ technique for preventing security\n      attacks performed by known attackers,\
    \ filtering an entire prefix\n      may lead to unnecessary termination of legitimate\
    \ traffic.\n   Recommendation\n      Origin-based filtering should be limited,\
    \ to the extent possible,\n      so as not to punish an entire autonomous system\
    \ for the crime of a\n      single host.  Individual address-based filtering should\
    \ be\n      preferred in cases where the address of the potential threat is\n\
    \      well known.\n"
- title: 3.4.  Length-Based Termination
  contents:
  - "3.4.  Length-Based Termination\n   Synopsis\n      Short IP packets are wrongfully\
    \ terminated due to their length.\n   Description\n      The minimum permissible\
    \ size of an IPv4 [RFC791] packet is 20\n      octets, and the minimum size of\
    \ an IPv6 [RFC8200] packet is 40\n      octets.  However, due to the size limits\
    \ of Ethernet, it is often\n      the case that IP packets that are shorter than\
    \ 46 octets are\n      discarded.  This is because the minimal Ethernet frame\
    \ size is 64\n      octets, the minimal Ethernet header size is 14 octets, and\
    \ the\n      Ethernet Frame Check Sequence is 4 octets long (i.e., 64 - 14 - 4\n\
    \      = 46). In the context of this memo, legitimate IP packets that are\n  \
    \    less than 46 octets long are referred to as 'short IP packets'.\n   Recommendation\n\
    \      Short IP packets should not be discarded.  The Ethernet frame\n      length\
    \ should be enforced at the Ethernet layer, while the IP\n      layer should avoid\
    \ discrimination of short IP packets.\n"
- title: 3.5.  IP-Version-Based Termination
  contents:
  - "3.5.  IP-Version-Based Termination\n   Synopsis\n      IPv6 packets are terminated\
    \ due to their version.\n   Description\n      Many routers and middleboxes are\
    \ configured to process only IPv4\n      [RFC791] packets and to reject IPv6 [RFC8200]\
    \ packets.\n   Recommendation\n      It is quite unsettling that there are still\
    \ networks in which IPv6\n      packets are deemed unwanted in the second decade\
    \ of the 21st\n      century.  Indeed, IPv6 packets have a slightly shorter payload\n\
    \      than IPv4 packets.  However, they are essential to the future\n      growth\
    \ of the Internet.  It is time for operators to finally give\n      IPv6 its well-deserved\
    \ opportunity.\n"
- title: 3.6.  Flag-Based Termination
  contents:
  - "3.6.  Flag-Based Termination\n   Synopsis\n      IPv4 packets are terminated\
    \ because their More Fragments (MF) flag\n      is set.\n   Description\n    \
    \  Many routers and middleboxes are configured to discard fragmented\n      packets.\n\
    \   Recommendation\n      A packet should not be discarded on the grounds of a\
    \ flag it\n      supports.  All flags should be respected, as well as the features\n\
    \      they represent.\n"
- title: 4.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "4.  Security Considerations\n   This memo proposes to practice liberality with\
    \ respect to IP packet\n   filtering in routers and middleboxes.  Arguably, such\

    \ characteristics, higher-layer protocols, or any other\n   IP characteristic.\n"
