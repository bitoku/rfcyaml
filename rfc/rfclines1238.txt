The Internet standard Network Management Framework consists of three components.
They are: RFC 1155 which defines the SMI, the mechanisms used for describing and naming objects for the purpose of management.
RFC 1212 defines a more concise description mechanism, which is wholly consistent with the SMI.
RFC 1156 which defines MIB I, the core set of managed objects for the Internet suite of protocols.
RFC 1213, defines MIB II, an evolution of MIB I based on implementation experience and new operational requirements.
RFC 1157 which defines the SNMP, the protocol used for network access to managed objects.
The Framework permits new objects to be defined for the purpose of experimentation and evaluation.
Objects Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed the Management Information Base or MIB.
Objects in the MIB are defined using the subset of Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1)
[7] defined in the SMI.
In particular, each object has a name, a syntax, and an encoding.
The name is an object identifier, an administratively assigned name, which specifies an object type.
The object type together with an object instance serves to uniquely identify a specific instantiation of the object.
For human convenience, we often use a textual string, termed the OBJECT DESCRIPTOR, to also refer to the object type.
The syntax of an object type defines the abstract data structure corresponding to that object type.
The ASN.1 language is used for this purpose.
However, the SMI [3] purposely restricts the ASN.1 constructs which may be used.
These restrictions are explicitly made for simplicity.
The encoding of an object type is simply how that object type is represented using the object type's syntax.
Implicitly tied to the notion of an object type's syntax and encoding
is how the object type is represented when being transmitted on the network.
The SMI specifies the use of the basic encoding rules of ASN.1 [8], subject to the additional requirements imposed by the SNMP.
Format of Definitions Section 4 contains the specification of all object types contained in this MIB module.
The object types are defined using the conventions defined in the SMI, as amended by the extensions specified in [9].
The objects defined in this MIB module are be used when the ISO Connectionless mode Network Protocol [10] and End System to Intermediate System [11] protocols are present.
No assumptions are made as to what underlying protocol is being used to carry the SNMP.
This memo uses the string encoding of [12] to textually describe OSI addresses.
A new data type is introduced as a textual convention in this MIB document.
This textual conventions enhance the readability of the specification and can ease comparison with other specifications if appropriate.
It should be noted that the introduction of this textual convention has no effect on either the syntax nor the semantics of any managed objects.
The use of this is merely an artifact of the explanatory method used.
Objects defined in terms of this methods are always encoded by means of the rules that define the primitive type.
Hence, no changes to the SMI or the SNMP are necessary to accommodate this textual convention which are adopted merely for the convenience of readers and writers in pursuit of the elusive goal of clear, concise, and unambiguous MIB documents.
The ASN.1 type ClnpAddress is used to denote an OSI address.
This consists of a string of octets.
The first octet of the string contains a binary value in the range of 0..20, and indicates the the length in octets of the NSAP.
Following the first octet, is the NSAP, expressed in concrete binary notation, starting with the most significant octet.
length NSAP is used as a "special" address meaning "the default NSAP" (analogous to the IP address of 0.0.0.0).
Such an NSAP is encoded as a single octet, containing the value 0.
All other NSAPs are encoded in at least 4 octets.
Changes from RFC 1162 Features of this MIB include: (1)
The managed objects in this document have been defined using the conventions defined in the Internet standard SMI, as amended by the extensions specified in [9].
It must be emphasized that definitions made using these extensions are semantically identically to those in RFC 1162.
(2)  The PhysAddress textual convention from MIB II has been introduced to represent media addresses.
(3)  The clnpRoutingDiscards, clnpRouteMetric5, and clnpRouteInfo objects have been defined.
The ClnpAddress type was mistakenly given a tag in RFC 1162.
This error has been corrected.
