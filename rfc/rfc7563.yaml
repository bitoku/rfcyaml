  - "1.  Introduction\n   \"Access Network Identifier (ANI) Option for Proxy Mobile\
    \ IPv6\"\n   [RFC6757] introduced the ANI mobility option.  This enabled a Mobile\n\
    \   Access Gateway (MAG) to provide the Network-Identifier, Geo-Location,\n  \
    \ and Operator-Identifier sub-options.  When the access network is\n   WLAN, the\
    \ Network-Identifier sub-option may contain the Service Set\n   Identifier (SSID)\
    \ and the Basic Service Set Identifier (BSSID) of the\n   Access Point (AP) and\
    \ the geolocation of the AP, and the Operator-\n   Identifier may contain the\
    \ realm of the operator managing the WLAN.\n   The MAG sends the above information\
    \ to the Local Mobility Anchor\n   (LMA).  The LMA may use this information to\
    \ determine access-network-\n   specific policies (in terms of Quality of Service\
    \ (QoS), Deep Packet\n   Inspection (DPI), etc.).  Further, the LMA may make this\
    \ information\n   available to location-based applications.\n   While the above\
    \ mentioned sub-options provide a rich set of\n   information, in this document\
    \ we describe the need for extending the\n   ANI sub-options that are particularly\
    \ useful in WLAN deployments.  In\n   WLAN deployments (especially indoor AP deployments),\
    \ it is difficult\n   to provide geospatial coordinates of APs.  At the same time,\
    \ for many\n   location-based applications the civic location is sufficient. \
    \ This\n   motivates the need for an ANI Civic-Location sub-option.  In many\n\
    \   deployments, operators tend to create groups of APs into \"AP-Groups\".\n\
    \   These groups have a group identifier.  The group identifier is used\n   as\
    \ a proxy for coarse location (such as the floor of a building or a\n   small\
    \ building).  The group identifier may also be used to provide a\n   common policy\
    \ (e.g., QoS, charging, DPI) for all APs in that group.\n   This specification\
    \ provides a sub-option for the MAG to convey a\n   group identifier to the LMA.\
    \  The provisioning of the group\n   identifier is outside the scope of this specification\
    \ and is\n   typically done via a configuration mechanism such as CLI (Command-\n\
    \   line Interface) or via Control and Provisioning of Wireless Access\n   Points\
    \ (CAPWAP) [RFC5415] [RFC5416].\n   This document also provides a new sub-option\
    \ that determines how\n   often the MAG will update the ANI.  In typical deployments,\
    \ it is\n   expected that the MAG will update the ANI as soon as it changes.\n\
    \   This is certainly true when the MAG is co-located with the AP.  When\n   a\
    \ client roams from one AP to another AP, the MAG on the roamed (or\n   sometimes\
    \ referred to as the target) AP will provide the new ANI (for\n   example, the\
    \ network identifier and geolocation of the new AP).\n   However, if the MAG is\
    \ co-located with an Access Controller (also\n   known as Wireless LAN Controller\
    \ (WLC)), then a client roaming from\n   one AP to another AP does not necessarily\
    \ perform an ANI update.  The\n   WLC handles client mobility between APs and\
    \ as a result, intra-WLC\n   mobility is hidden from the LMA.\n   In such deployments,\
    \ the information conveyed in the ANI sub-options\n   (e.g., location) becomes\
    \ stale and is only refreshed at the time of\n   lifetime expiry.  The MAG could\
    \ deal with this by sending a Proxy\n   Binding Update (PBU) whenever a client\
    \ moves between APs just for the\n   purpose of updating the ANI sub-option. \
    \ Alternately, this document\n   allows the LMA to determine how often it wants\
    \ to know about the\n   changes in the ANI sub-option; for example, in some cases\
    \ the LMA may\n   not care about the ANI sub-option except at the time of initial\n\
    \   binding, or in some cases it may care about every AP transition.  The\n  \
    \ sub-option allows the LMA to tell the MAG the desired update\n   frequency.\
    \  As always, mobility events or re-registration events will\n   update the ANI\
    \ sub-options.  The LMA can use the ANI Update-Timer\n   option to set the maximum\
    \ frequency at which it wants to receive ANI\n   updates.  This is particularly\
    \ useful in environments where a MAG\n   covers a large number of Wi-Fi APs and\
    \ there is high client mobility\n   between the APs; for example, in a stadium\
    \ Wi-Fi deployment, if a LMA\n   does not want ANI updates any more often than\
    \ 100 seconds, then it\n   can propose 100 seconds as the value for ANI Update-Timer.\n\
    \   [RFC6757] provides ANI sub-options to carry geolocation information.\n   In\
    \ this document, we provide additional sub-options to carry the\n   civic location\
    \ and group identifier.  This document also defines an\n   ANI sub-option to enable\
    \ a MAG to communicate how often the MAG will\n   update the ANI information.\n"

    \     information elements associated with the current session.\n      Specifically,\
    \ the following parameters are defined:\n      *  civic location\n      *  MAG\
    \ group identifier\n      *  ANI Update-Timer\n   o  If the mobile access gateway\
    \ is configured to support the Access\n      Network Information sub-options defined\
    \ in this specification, it\n      includes this option with the specific sub-options\
    \ in all PBU\n      messages (including PBUs for lifetime extension and for\n\
    \      deregistration) that it sends to the LMA.  The Access Network\n      Information\
    \ option is constructed as specified in Section 3.\n   o  ANI Update-Timer Considerations:\
    \ The MAG sets the Update-Timer\n      based on an exchange of timer values with\
    \ the LMA.  When the ANI\n      Update-Timer sub-option is carried in a PBU, it\
    \ is considered as a\n      proposed value for the Update-Timer.  The LMA may\
    \ change the value\n      of the Update-Timer received in the PBU.  When the LMA-provided\n\
    \      value for the Update-Timer is different than what is sent by the\n    \
    \  MAG, the MAG should use the LMA-provided value.  If the MAG does\n      not\
    \ receive an ANI Update-Timer sub-option in the Proxy Binding\n      Acknowledgement\
    \ (PBA) (in response to sending the sub-option in\n      the PBU), then MAG behavior\
    \ is in accordance to [RFC6757].  When\n      ANI parameters of a mobility session\
    \ change, the MAG checks\n      whether the Update-Timer has expired.  If the\
    \ Update-Timer has\n      expired, the MAG sends a PBU with the ANI option.  The\
    \ ANI option\n      reflects the updated access network parameters for that mobility\n\
    \      session.  If the Update-Timer has not expired, the MAG does not\n     \
    \ send a PBU.  When the Update-Timer for a mobility session expires,\n      the\
    \ MAG checks whether the ANI parameters have changed.  If the\n      parameters\
    \ have changed from the last reported values, the MAG\n      sends a PBU with\
    \ an ANI option.  If the parameters have not\n      changed, the MAG does not\
    \ send a PBU (and the Update-Timer remains\n      expired).  Note that the MAG\
    \ may send a PBU even before the\n      Update-Timer expires.  This could be,\
    \ for example, to initiate a\n      QoS service request to the LMA (see [RFC7222]).\
    \  In such cases,\n      the MAG must reset the Update-Timer when it sends a PBU.\n\
    \   o  If the mobile access gateway had any of the Access Network\n      Information\
    \ mobility options included in the PBU sent to an LMA,\n      then the PBA received\
    \ from the LMA should contain the Access\n      Network Information mobility option\
    \ with the specific sub-options.\n      If the mobile access gateway receives\
    \ a PBA with a successful\n      Status Value but without an Access Network Information\
    \ mobility\n      option, then the mobile access gateway may log the event and,\n\
    \      based on its local policy, even proceed to terminate the mobility\n   \
    \   session.  In this case, the mobile access gateway knows the LMA\n      does\
    \ not understand the Access Network Information mobility\n      option.\n"

  - "6.  Security Considerations\n   The Civic-Location sub-option defined in this\
    \ specification is\n   carried in the Access Network Identifier option defined\
    \ in [RFC6757].\n   This sub-option is carried in PBU and PBA messages.  This\
    \ sub-option\n   is carried like any other Access Network Identifier sub-option\
    \ as\n   defined in [RFC6757].  Therefore, it inherits its security guidelines\n\
    \   from [RFC5213] and [RFC6757] and does not require any additional\n   security\
    \ considerations.\n   The Civic-Location sub-option exposes the civic location\
    \ of the\n   network to which the mobile node is attached.  This information is\n\
    \   considered to be very sensitive, so care must be taken to secure the\n   Proxy\
    \ Mobile IPv6 signaling messages when carrying this sub-option.\n   The base Proxy\
    \ Mobile IPv6 specification [RFC5213] specifies the use\n   of IPsec for securing\
    \ the signaling messages, and those mechanisms\n   can be enabled for protecting\
    \ this information.  Operators can\n   potentially apply IPsec Encapsulating Security\
    \ Payload (ESP) with\n   confidentiality and integrity protection for protecting\
    \ the location\n   information.  The other way to protect the sensitive location\n\
    \   information of network users is of course to not send it in the first\n  \
    \ place.  Users of the Civic-Location sub-option should provision\n   location\
    \ values with the highest possible level of granularity, e.g.,\n   to the province\
    \ or city level rather than provisioning specific\n   addresses.\n   Access-network-specific\
    \ information elements that the mobile access\n   gateway sends may have been\
    \ dynamically learned over DHCP or using\n   other protocols.  If proper security\
    \ mechanisms are not in place, the\n   exchanged information between the MAG and\
    \ LMA may be compromised.\n   This situation may result in incorrect service policy\
    \ enforcement at\n   the LMA and impact other services that depend on this access\
    \ network\n   information.  This threat can be mitigated by ensuring the\n   communication\
    \ path between the mobile access gateway and the access\n   points is properly\
    \ secured by the use of IPsec, Transport Layer\n   Security (TLS), or other security\
    \ protocols.\n"
