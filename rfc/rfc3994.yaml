    \ of a message of any type, including text,\n   voice, or video.  The status messages\
    \ are delivered to the instant\n   messaging recipient in the same manner as the\
    \ instant messages\n   themselves.\n"

- title: 1.  Introduction

  - "1.  Introduction\n   By definition, instant messaging (IM) is message based:\
    \  A user\n   composes a message by, for example, typing, speaking, or recording\
    \ a\n   video clip.  This message is then sent to one or more recipients.\n  \
    \ Unlike email, instant messaging is often conversational, so the other\n   party\
    \ is waiting for a response.  If no response is forthcoming, a\n   participant\
    \ in an instant messaging conversation may erroneously\n   assume either that\
    \ the communication partner has left or that it is\n   her turn to type again,\
    \ leading to two messages \"crossing on the\n   wire\".\n   To avoid this uncertainty,\
    \ a number of commercial instant messaging\n   systems feature an \"is-typing\"\
    \ indication sent as soon as one party\n   starts typing a message.  In this document,\
    \ we describe a generalized\n   version of this indication, called the isComposing\
    \ status message.\n   As described in Section 3 in more detail, a status message\
    \ is\n   delivered to the instant message recipient in the same manner as are\n\
    \   the messages themselves.  The isComposing status messages can\n   announce\
    \ the composition of any media type, not just text.  For\n   example, it might\
    \ be used if somebody is recording an audio or video\n   clip.  In addition, it\
    \ can be extended to convey other instant\n   messaging user states in the future.\
    \  Below, we will call these\n   messages \"status messages\" for brevity.\n \
    \  The status messages are carried as XML, as instances of the XML\n   schema\
    \ defined in Section 6, and labeled as an\n   application/im-iscomposing+xml content\
    \ type.\n   These status messages can be considered somewhat analogous to the\n\
    \   comfort noise packets that are transmitted in silence-suppressed\n   interactive\
    \ voice conversations.\n      Events and extensions to presence, such as PIDF\
    \ [6], were also\n      considered but have a number of disadvantages.  They add\
    \ more\n      overhead, as an explicit and periodic subscription is required.\n\
    \      For page-mode delivery, subscribing to the right user agent and\n     \
    \ set of messages may not be easy.  An in-band, message-based\n      mechanism\
    \ is also easier to translate across heterogeneous instant\n      messaging systems.\n\
    \   The mechanism described here aims to satisfy the requirements in [7].\n"
- title: 2.  Terminology and Conventions
  contents:
  - "2.  Terminology and Conventions\n   This memo makes use of the vocabulary defined\
    \ in the IMPP Model\n   document [1].  In this memo, terms such as CLOSED, INSTANT\
    \ MESSAGE,\n   OPEN, PRESENCE SERVICE, PRESENTITY, WATCHER, and WATCHER USER AGENT\n\
    \   are used with the same meaning defined therein.  The key words MUST,\n   MUST\
    \ NOT, REQUIRED, SHOULD, SHOULD NOT, RECOMMENDED, MAY, and\n   OPTIONAL in this\
    \ document are to be interpreted as described in BCP\n   14, RFC 2119 [2].\n \
    \  This document discusses two kinds of messages; namely, the instant\n   message\
    \ (IM) conveying actual content between two or more users\n   engaged in an instant\
    \ messaging conversation, and the status message,\n   described in this document,\
    \ which indicates the current composing\n   status to the other participants in\
    \ a conversation.  We use the terms\n   \"content message\" and \"status message\"\
    \ for these two message types.\n"

- title: 3.1.  Overview
  contents:
  - "3.1.  Overview\n   We model the user of an instant messaging system as being\
    \ in one of\n   several states, in this document limited to \"idle\" and \"active\"\
    .  By\n   default, the user is in \"idle\" state, both before starting to compose\n\
    \   a message and after sending it.\n"
- title: 3.2.  Message Composer Behavior
  contents:
  - "3.2.  Message Composer Behavior\n   Only the instant messaging user agent actively\
    \ composing a content\n   message generates status messages indicating the current\
    \ state.  When\n   the user starts composing a content message (the actual instant\n\
    \   message), the state becomes \"active\", and an isComposing status\n   message\
    \ containing a <state> element indicating \"active\" is sent to\n   the recipient\
    \ of the content message being composed.  As long as the\n   user continues to\
    \ produce instant message content, the user remains\n   in state \"active\".\n\
    \   There are two sender timers: the active-state refresh interval, and\n   the\
    \ idle time-out interval.\n   The active-state refresh interval determines how\
    \ often \"active\" state\n   messages are sent while the composer remains in \"\
    active\" state.  The\n   interval is chosen by the composing user and indicated\
    \ in the\n   <refresh> element in the status message, expressed in integer\n \
    \  seconds.  Each transmission of the isComposing message resets the\n   timer.\
    \  The interval SHOULD be no shorter than 60 seconds.  A message\n   composer\
    \ MAY decide not to send active-state refresh messages at all.\n   This is indicated\
    \ by omitting the refresh interval; this will cause\n   the receiver to assume\
    \ that it has gone idle after 120 seconds.  (In\n   most cases, the content message\
    \ will have been sent by then.)  No\n   refresh messages are sent in \"idle\"\
    \ state.\n      The active-state refresh mechanism deals with the case in which\n\
    \      the user logs off or the application crashes before the content\n     \
    \ message is completed.\n   If the user stops composing for more than a configured\
    \ time interval,\n   the idle timeout, the state transitions to \"idle\", and\
    \ an \"idle\"\n   status message is sent.  If the user starts composing again\
    \ while in\n   \"idle\" state, the state transitions to \"active\", and the\n\
    \   corresponding status message is sent.  Unless otherwise configured by\n  \
    \ the user, the idle timeout SHOULD have a default value of 15 seconds.\n   If\
    \ a content message is sent before the idle threshold expires, no\n   \"idle\"\
    \ state indication is needed.  Thus, in most cases, only one\n   status message\
    \ is generated for each content message.  In any event,\n   the message rate is\
    \ limited to one status message per refresh\n   threshold interval.\n   The state\
    \ transitions are shown in Figure 1.\n                      +-------------+\n\

  - "3.5.  Additional Status Information\n   The status message contains additional\
    \ optional elements to provide\n   further details on the composition activity.\
    \  Any of these can appear\n   in both \"active\" and \"idle\" state messages.\n\
    \   The optional <lastactive> element describes the absolute time when\n   the\
    \ user last added or edited content.\n   The optional <contenttype> element indicates\
    \ the type of medium in\n   which the messaging terminal is currently composing.\
    \  It can contain\n   either just a MIME media type, such as \"audio\" or \"text\"\
    , or a media\n   type and subtype, such as \"text/html\".  It is best understood\
    \ as a\n   hint to the user, not a guarantee, that the actual content message\n\
    \   will indeed contain only the content indicated.  It allows the human\n   recipient\
    \ to be prepared for the likely message format.\n   To further describe message\
    \ composition, the XML schema or the set of\n   allowable state names can be extended\
    \ in future documents.\n   Recipients of status messages implementing this specification\
    \ without\n   extensions MUST treat state tokens other than \"idle\" and \"active\"\
    \ as\n   \"idle\".  Additional elements MUST use their own namespaces and MUST\n\
    \   be designed so that receivers can safely ignore such extensions.\n   Adding\
    \ elements to the namespace defined in this document is not\n   permitted.\n \
    \  The isComposing status message MAY be carried in CPIM messages [3].\n     \
    \ Such a wrapper is particularly useful if messages are relayed by a\n      conference\
    \ server since the CPIM message maintains the identity of\n      the original\
    \ composer.\n"
- title: 4.  Using the Status Message
  contents:
  - "4.  Using the Status Message\n   The isComposing status message can be used with\
    \ either page mode or\n   session mode, although session mode is a more natural\
    \ fit.  In\n   session mode, the status message is sent as part of the messaging\n\
    \   stream.  Its usage is negotiated just like any other media type in\n   that\
    \ stream, with details depending on the session mode protocol.\n   Sending the\
    \ status messages within the session-mode messaging stream\n   has at least three\
    \ benefits.  First, it ensures proper ordering and\n   synchronization with the\
    \ actual content messages being composed.  In\n   messaging systems that guarantee\
    \ in-order delivery of messages, this\n   approach avoids having an active indication\
    \ appear at the receiver\n   after the actual message has been delivered, due\
    \ to message\n   reordering across two delivery mechanisms.\n   Secondly, end-to-end\
    \ security can be applied to the messages.\n   Thirdly, session negotiation mechanisms\
    \ can be used to turn it on and\n   off at any time, and even to negotiate its\
    \ use in a single direction\n   at a time.\n   Usage with page mode is also straightforward:\
    \ The status message is\n   carried as the body of a page mode message.  In SIP-based\
    \ IM, The\n   composer MUST cease transmitting status messages if the receiver\n\
    \   returned a 415 status code (Unsupported Media Type) in response to a\n   MESSAGE\
    \ request containing the status indication.\n   The sender cannot be assured that\
    \ the status message is delivered\n   before the actual content being composed\
    \ arrives.  However, SIP page\n   mode is limited to one unacknowledged message,\
    \ so out-of-order\n   delivery is unlikely, albeit still possible if proxies are\
    \ involved.\n"

  - "7.  Security Considerations\n   The isComposing indication provides a fine-grained\
    \ view of the\n   activity of the entity composing and thus deserves particularly\n\
    \   careful confidentiality protection so that only the intended\n   recipient\
    \ of the message will receive the isComposing indication.\n   Since the status\
    \ messages are carried by using the IM protocol\n   itself, all security considerations\
    \ of the underlying IM protocol\n   also apply to the isComposing status messages.\n\
    \   There are potential privacy issues in sending isComposing status\n   messages\
    \ before an actual conversation has been established between\n   the communicating\
    \ users.  A status message may be sent even if the\n   user later abandons the\
    \ message.  It is RECOMMENDED that isComposing\n   indications in page mode are\
    \ only sent when a message is being\n   composed as a reply to an earlier message.\
    \  This document does not\n   prescribe how an implementation detects whether\
    \ a message is in\n   response to an earlier one in page mode, but elapsed time\
    \ or user\n   interface behavior might be used as hints.\n"
