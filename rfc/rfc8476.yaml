  - "1.  Introduction\n   When Segment Routing (SR) paths are computed by a centralized\n
    \  controller, it is critical that the controller learn the Maximum SID\n   Depth
    (MSD) that can be imposed at each node/link on a given SR path.\n   This ensures
    that the Segment Identifier (SID) stack depth of a\n   computed path doesn't exceed
    the number of SIDs the node is capable\n   of imposing.\n   [PCEP-EXT] defines
    how to signal MSD in the Path Computation Element\n   Communication Protocol (PCEP).
    \ However, if PCEP is not supported/\n   configured on the head-end of an SR tunnel
    or a Binding-SID anchor\n   node, and the controller does not participate in IGP
    routing, it has\n   no way of learning the MSD of nodes and links.  BGP-LS (Distribution\n
    \  of Link-State and TE Information Using BGP) [RFC7752] defines a way\n   to
    expose topology and associated attributes and capabilities of the\n   nodes in
    that topology to a centralized controller.  MSD signaling by\n   BGP-LS has been
    defined in [MSD-BGP].  Typically, BGP-LS is\n   configured on a small number of
    nodes that do not necessarily act as\n   head-ends.  In order for BGP-LS to signal
    MSD for all the nodes and\n   links in the network for which MSD is relevant,
    MSD capabilities\n   SHOULD be advertised by every OSPF router in the network.\n
    \  Other types of MSDs are known to be useful.  For example, [ELC-ISIS]\n   defines
    Entropy Readable Label Depth (ERLD), which is used by a\n   head-end to insert
    an Entropy Label (EL) at a depth where it can be\n   read by transit nodes.\n
    \  This document defines an extension to OSPF used to advertise one or\n   more
    types of MSDs at node and/or link granularity.  In the future,\n   it is expected
    that new MSD-Types will be defined to signal\n   additional capabilities, e.g.,
    ELs, SIDs that can be imposed through\n   recirculation, or SIDs associated with
    another data plane such\n   as IPv6.\n   MSD advertisements MAY be useful even
    if SR itself is not enabled.\n   For example, in a non-SR MPLS network, MSD defines
    the maximum label\n   depth.\n"

    Opaque LSA [RFC7770]\n   is defined to carry the provisioned SID depth of the
    router\n   originating the RI LSA.  Node MSD is the smallest MSD supported by\n

  - "4.  Procedures for Defining and Using Node and Link MSD Advertisements\n   When
    Link MSD is present for a given MSD-Type, the value of the Link\n   MSD MUST take
    precedence over the Node MSD.  When a Link MSD-Type is\n   not signaled but the
    Node MSD-Type is, then the Node MSD-Type value\n   MUST be considered as the MSD
    value for that link.\n   In order to increase flooding efficiency, it is RECOMMENDED
    that\n   routers with homogenous Link MSD values advertise just the Node MSD\n
    \  value.\n   The meaning of the absence of both Node and Link MSD advertisements\n
    \  for a given MSD-Type is specific to the MSD-Type.  Generally, it can\n   only
    be inferred that the advertising node does not support\n   advertisement of that
    MSD-Type.  However, in some cases the lack of\n   advertisement might imply that
    the functionality associated with the\n   MSD-Type is not supported.  Per [RFC8491],
    the correct interpretation\n   MUST be specified when an MSD-Type is defined.\n"
