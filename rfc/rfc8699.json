This document describes such a method for\nflows that have the same sender, in a way that is as flexible and\nsimple as possible while minimizing the number of changes needed to\nexisting RTP applications. This document also specifies how to apply\nthe method for the Network-Assisted Dynamic Adaptation (NADA)\ncongestion control algorithm and provides suggestions on how to apply\nit to other congestion control algorithms.","pub_date":"January 1970","keywords":["tcp"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":null,"errata_url":null}
