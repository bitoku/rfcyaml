  - "1.  Introduction\n   A typical enterprise network consists of users connecting\
    \ to the\n   services from a trusted network (intranet), and from an untrusted\n\
    \   network (Internet).  The trusted and untrusted networks are typically\n  \
    \ separated by a demilitarized zone (DMZ).  Access to the intranet is\n   controlled\
    \ by a firewall and a Virtual Private Network (VPN) gateway\n   in the DMZ.\n\
    \   Enterprise users, when roaming on untrusted networks, most often have\n  \
    \ to authenticate themselves to the VPN gateway and set up a secure\n   tunnel\
    \ in order to access the intranet.  The use of IPsec VPNs is\n   very common to\
    \ enable such secure connectivity to the intranet.  When\n   the user is on the\
    \ trusted network, VPNs are not used.  However, the\n   users benefit tremendously\
    \ when session mobility between subnets,\n   through the use of Mobile IPv4, is\
    \ available.\n   There has been some work done on using Mobile IPv4 and IPsec\
    \ VPNs to\n   provide roaming and secure connectivity to an enterprise [RFC5265]\n\
    \   [RFC4093].  The solution described in [RFC5265] was designed with\n   certain\
    \ restrictions, including requiring no modifications to the VPN\n   gateways,\
    \ and involves the use of two layers of MIPv4, with one home\n   agent inside\
    \ the intranet and one in the Internet or in the DMZ\n   before the VPN gateway.\
    \  The per-packet overhead is very high in this\n   solution.  It is also challenging\
    \ to implement and have two instances\n   of MIPv4 active at the same time on\
    \ a mobile node.  However, the\n   solution described here is only applicable\
    \ when Internet Key Exchange\n   Protocol version 2 (IKEv2) IPsec VPNs are used.\n\
    \   This document describes an alternate solution that does not require\n   two\
    \ layers of MIPv4.  The solution described in this document uses\n   Mobile IPv4\
    \ when the mobile node is on the trusted network and\n   MOBIKE-capable IPsec\
    \ VPNs when the mobile node is on the untrusted\n   network.  The mobile node\
    \ uses the tunnel inner address (TIA) given\n   out by the IPsec VPN gateway as\
    \ the co-located care-of address (CoA)\n   for MIPv4 registration.  This eliminates\
    \ the need for using an\n   external MIPv4 home agent and the need for encapsulating\
    \ the VPN\n   tunnel inside a MIPv4 tunnel.\n   The following assumptions are\
    \ made for the solution described in this\n   document.\n   o  IKEv2 [RFC4306]\
    \ and IPsec [RFC4301] are used to set up the VPN\n      tunnels between the mobile\
    \ node and the VPN gateway.\n   o  The VPN gateway and the mobile node support\
    \ MOBIKE extensions as\n      defined in [RFC4555].\n   o  When the mobile node\
    \ is on the trusted network, traffic should not\n      go through the DMZ.  Current\
    \ deployments of firewalls and DMZs\n      consider the scenario where only a\
    \ small amount of the total\n      enterprise traffic goes through the DMZ.  Routing\
    \ through the DMZ\n      typically involves stateful inspection of each packet\
    \ by the\n      firewalls in the DMZ.  Moreover, the DMZ architecture assumes\
    \ that\n      the DMZ is less secure than the internal network.  Therefore, the\n\
    \      DMZ-based architecture allows the least amount of traffic to\n      traverse\
    \ the DMZ, that is, only traffic between the trusted\n      network and the external\
    \ network.  Requiring all normal traffic to\n      the mobile nodes to traverse\
    \ the DMZ would negate this\n      architecture.\n   o  When the mobile node is\
    \ on the trusted network and uses a wireless\n      access technology, confidentiality\
    \ protection of the data traffic\n      is provided by the particular access technology.\
    \  In some\n      networks, confidentiality protection MAY be available between\
    \ the\n      mobile node and the first hop access router, in which case it is\n\
    \      not required at layer 2.\n   This document also presents a solution for\
    \ the mobile node to detect\n   when it is on a trusted network, so that the IPsec\
    \ tunnel can be\n   dropped and the mobile node can use Mobile IP in the intranet.\n\
    \   IPsec VPN gateways that use IKEv1 [RFC2409] are not addressed in this\n  \
    \ document.\n"

  - "3.  Solution Overview\n   The mobile node is configured with a home address that\
    \ remains the\n   same irrespective of whether the mobile node is inside or outside\
    \ the\n   enterprise network.  The mobile node is also reachable at the same\n\
    \   home address irrespective of its current point of attachment.  When\n   the\
    \ mobile node is connected to the intranet directly, it uses Mobile\n   IP for\
    \ internal mobility.\n   When the mobile node roams and connects to an untrusted\
    \ network\n   outside the enterprise, it sets up a VPN tunnel to the VPN gateway.\n\
    \   However, it still maintains a valid binding cache entry at the i-HA.\n   It\
    \ uses the VPN-TIA, allocated by the VPN gateway, as the co-located\n   CoA for\
    \ registration with the i-HA.  If the VPN-TIA changes or if the\n   mobile node\
    \ moves and connects to another VPN gateway, then it sends\n   a Registration\
    \ Request to the i-HA using the new co-located CoA.\n   If the mobile node moves\
    \ while outside the enterprise and its access\n   network changes, it uses the\
    \ MOBIKE protocol to update the VPN\n   gateway of its current address.  The internal\
    \ home agent is not aware\n   of the mobile node's movement as long as the mobile\
    \ node is attached\n   to the same VPN gateway and the TIA remains the same.\n\

    \ 1: Network Topology Using MIPv4 and MOBIKE\n   The solution described above\
    \ results in a Mobile IP tunnel inside an\n   IPsec tunnel.  The Mobile IP tunnel\
    \ is between the mobile node and\n   the home agent, and the IPsec tunnel is between\
    \ the mobile node (MN)\n   and the mVPN gateway.  The mobile node MUST reverse\
    \ tunnel through\n   the home agent [RFC3024] when the Mobile IP tunnel is inside\
    \ an IPsec\n   tunnel.\n   The overhead of running a Mobile IP tunnel inside an\
    \ IPsec tunnel can\n   be avoided by having the Mobile IP foreign agent functionality\
    \ on the\n   VPN gateway.  This is out of scope for this document and is further\n\
    \   described in [MEGHANA].\n   Whenever the mobile node attaches to a new link,\
    \ it may encounter a\n   foreign agent.  The mobile node MUST not use the foreign\
    \ agent\n   care-of address with the i-HA when attached to an untrusted access\n\
    \   network.  The default behavior for the mobile node is to always\n   configure\
    \ an address from the access link using DHCP.  The mobile\n   node then checks\
    \ if it is attached to a trusted access network by\n   sending a Registration\
    \ Request to the i-HA in the co-located care-of\n   address mode.  If the mobile\
    \ node discovers that it is attached to a\n   trusted access network, then it\
    \ MAY start using a foreign agent\n   care-of address with the i-HA.  In order\
    \ to do this, the mobile node\n   has to perform a new registration with the i-HA.\n\
    \   The mobile node can use a foreign agent on a untrusted access\n   network,\
    \ if there is an external home agent that the mobile node is\n   able to use.\
    \  The use of an external home agent in the untrusted\n   access network and a\
    \ home agent in the trusted access network at the\n   same time is described in\
    \ detail in [RFC5265].\n   Some IPsec VPN implementations allow a host to send\
    \ traffic directly\n   to the Internet when attached to an untrusted network.\
    \  This traffic\n   bypasses the IPsec tunnel with the VPN gateway.  This document\
    \ does\n   not prevent such traffic from being sent out from the host, but there\n\
    \   will be no mobility or session continuity for the traffic.  Any data\n   traffic\
    \ that is sent through the Mobile IP tunnel with the home agent\n   is always\
    \ sent through the VPN gateway.\n"

    \   mobile node is attached to an untrusted network and is required to\n   set\
    \ up an IPsec tunnel with a VPN gateway to gain access to the\n   trusted network.\n"
- title: 3.2.  Mobility within the Enterprise
  contents:
  - "3.2.  Mobility within the Enterprise\n   When the mobile node is inside the enterprise\
    \ network and attached to\n   the intranet, it uses Mobile IPv4 [RFC3344] for\
    \ subnet mobility.  The\n   mobile node always configures a care-of address through\
    \ DHCP on the\n   access link and uses it as the co-located care-of address. \
    \ The\n   mobile node MAY use a foreign agent care-of address, if a foreign\n\
    \   agent is available.  However, the foreign agent care-of address is\n   used\
    \ only when the mobile node is attached to the trusted access\n   network.  The\
    \ mobile node attempts Foreign Agent discovery and CoA\n   address acquisition\
    \ through DHCP simultaneously in order to avoid the\n   delay in discovering a\
    \ foreign agent when there is no foreign agent\n   available.  The mobile node\
    \ maintains a valid binding cache entry at\n   all times at the home agent mapping\
    \ the home address to the current\n   CoA.  Whenever the mobile node moves, it\
    \ sends a Registration Request\n   to update the binding cache entry.\n   The\
    \ Mobile IP signaling messages between the mobile node and the home\n   agent\
    \ are authenticated as described in [RFC3344].\n   The mobile node maintains a\
    \ valid binding cache entry at the home\n   agent even when it is outside the\
    \ enterprise network.\n"

  contents:
  - "3.3.  Mobility When outside the Enterprise\n   When the mobile node is attached\
    \ to an untrusted network, it sets up\n   an IPsec VPN tunnel with the VPN gateway\
    \ to gain access to the\n   enterprise network.  If the mobile node moves and\
    \ its IP address\n   changes, it initiates the MOBIKE protocol [RFC4555] to update\
    \ the\n   address on the VPN gateway.\n   The mobile node maintains a binding\
    \ at the home agent even when it is\n   outside the enterprise network.  If the\
    \ TIA changes due to the mobile\n   node re-connecting to the VPN gateway or attaching\
    \ to a different VPN\n   gateway, the mobile node should send a Registration Request\
    \ to its\n   home agent to update the binding cache with the new TIA.\n"
- title: 3.4.  Crossing Security Boundaries
  contents:
  - "3.4.  Crossing Security Boundaries\n   Security boundary detection is based on\
    \ the reachability of the i-HA\n   from the mobile node's current point of attachment.\
    \  Whenever the\n   mobile node detects a change in network connectivity, it sends\
    \ a\n   Registration Request to the i-HA without any VPN encapsulation.  If\n\
    \   the mobile node receives a Registration Reply with the Trusted\n   Networks\
    \ Configured (TNC) extension from the i-HA, then it assumes\n   that it is on\
    \ a trusted network.  The TNC extension is described in\n   [RFC5265].  The mobile\
    \ node MUST check that the Registration Reply is\n   integrity protected using\
    \ the mobile node-home agent mobility\n   security association before concluding\
    \ it is attached to a trusted\n   network.  This security boundary detection is\
    \ based on the mechanism\n   described in [RFC5265] to detect attachment to the\
    \ internal trusted\n   network.  The mobile node should re-transmit the Registration\
    \ Request\n   if it does not receive the Registration Reply within a timeout\n\
    \   period.  The number of times the mobile node should re-transmit the\n   Registration\
    \ Request and the timeout period for receiving the\n   Registration Reply are\
    \ configurable on the mobile node.\n   When the mobile node is attached to an\
    \ untrusted network and is using\n   an IPsec VPN to the enterprise network, the\
    \ ability to send a\n   Registration Request to the i-HA without VPN encapsulation\
    \ would\n   require some interaction between the IPsec and MIPv4 modules on the\n\
    \   mobile node.  This is local to the mobile node and out of scope for\n   this\
    \ document.\n   If the mobile node has an existing VPN tunnel to its VPN gateway,\
    \ it\n   MUST send a MOBIKE message at the same time as the registration\n   request\
    \ to the i-HA whenever the IP address changes.  If the mobile\n   node receives\
    \ a response from the VPN gateway, but not from the i-HA,\n   it assumes it is\
    \ outside the enterprise network.  If it receives a\n   response from the i-HA,\
    \ then it assumes it is inside the enterprise\n   network.\n   There could also\
    \ be some out-of-band mechanisms that involve\n   configuring the wireless access\
    \ points with some information that the\n   mobile node can recognize as access\
    \ points that belong to the trusted\n   network in an enterprise network.  Such\
    \ mechanisms are beyond the\n   scope of this document.\n   The mobile node should\

  - "3.4.2.  Operation When Moving from a Trusted Network\n   When the mobile node\
    \ is inside the enterprise and attached to the\n   intranet, it does not use a\
    \ VPN tunnel for data traffic.  It has a\n   valid binding cache entry at its\
    \ home agent.  If the VPN gateway is\n   reachable from the trusted network, the\
    \ mobile node MAY have valid\n   IKEv2 security associations with its VPN gateway.\
    \  The IPsec security\n   associations can be created when required.  The mobile\
    \ node may have\n   to re-negotiate the IKEv2 security associations to prevent\
    \ them from\n   expiring.\n   If the mobile node moves and its IP address changes,\
    \ it performs the\n   following steps:\n   1.  Initiate an IKE mobility exchange\
    \ to update the VPN gateway with\n       the current address, or if there is no\
    \ VPN connection, then\n       establish a VPN tunnel with the gateway from the\
    \ new local IP\n       address.  If the new network is trusted, and if the VPN\
    \ gateway\n       is reachable, this exchange will allow the mobile node to keep\n\
    \       the VPN state alive, while in the trusted side.  If the new\n       network\
    \ is trusted and if the VPN gateway is not reachable from\n       inside, then\
    \ this exchange will fail.\n   2.  At the same time as step 1, send a Mobile IPv4\
    \ Registration\n       Request to the internal home agent without VPN encapsulation.\n\
    \   3.  If the mobile node receives a Registration Reply to the request\n    \
    \   sent in step 2, then the current subnet is a trusted subnet, and\n       the\
    \ mobile node can communicate without VPN tunneling, using only\n       Mobile\
    \ IP with the new care-of address.\n   4.  If the mobile node didn't receive the\
    \ response in step 3, and if\n       the VPN tunnel is successfully established\
    \ and registered in step\n       1, then the mobile node sends a Registration\
    \ Request over the VPN\n       tunnel to the internal home agent.  After receiving\
    \ a\n       Registration Reply from the home agent, the mobile node can start\n\
    \       communicating over the VPN tunnel with the Mobile IP home\n       address.\n"

  - "4.  NAT Traversal\n   There could be a Network Address Translation (NAT) device\
    \ between the\n   mobile node and the home agent in any of the access modes, 'c',\
    \ 'f',\n   and 'mc', and between the mobile node and the VPN gateway in the\n\
    \   access mode 'mc'.  Mobile IPv4 NAT traversal, as described in\n   [RFC3519],\
    \ should be used by the mobile node and the home agent in\n   access modes 'c'\
    \ or 'f', when there is a NAT device present.  When\n   using access mode, 'mc',\
    \ IPsec NAT traversal [RFC3947] [RFC3948]\n   should be used by the mobile node\
    \ and the VPN gateway, if there is a\n   NAT device present.  Typically, the TIA\
    \ would be a routable address\n   inside the enterprise network.  But in some\
    \ cases, the TIA could be\n   from a private address space associated with the\
    \ VPN gateway.  In\n   such a case, Mobile IPv4 NAT traversal should be used in\
    \ addition to\n   IPsec NAT traversal in the 'mc' mode.\n"

    \ keeping this in\n   mind.\n   Security concerns related to the mobile node detecting\
    \ that it is on\n   a trusted network and thereafter dropping the VPN tunnel are\n\
    \   described in [RFC5265].\n   When the mobile node sends a Registration Request\
    \ to the i-HA from an\n   untrusted network that does not go through the IPsec\
    \ tunnel, it will\n   reveal the i-HA's address, its own identity including the\
    \ NAI and the\n   home address, and the Authenticator value in the authentication\n\
    \   extensions to the untrusted network.  This may be a concern in some\n   deployments.\n\

    \     Figure 2: Network Topology of a Mobile Operator with Trusted and\n     \
    \                       Untrusted Networks\n   An IPsec VPN gateway provides secure\
    \ connectivity to the Operator's\n   internal network for mobile nodes attached\
    \ to an untrusted access\n   network.  The VPN gateway supports MOBIKE extensions\
    \ so that the\n   IPsec tunnels survive any IP address change when the mobile\
    \ node\n   moves while attached to the untrusted access networks.\n   When the\
    \ mobile node is attached to the trusted access network, it\n   uses Mobile IP\
    \ with the i-HA.  It uses the IP address obtained from\n   the trusted access\
    \ network as the co-located care-of address to\n   register with the i-HA.  If\
    \ a foreign agent is available in the\n   trusted access network, the mobile node\
    \ may use a foreign agent\n   care-of address.  If the mobile node moves and attaches\
    \ to an\n   untrusted access network, it sets up an IPsec tunnel with the VPN\n\
    \   gateway to access the Operator's internal network.  It uses the IPsec\n  \
    \ TIA as the co-located care-of address to register with the i-HA\n   thereby\
    \ creating a Mobile IP tunnel inside an IPsec tunnel.\n   When the mobile node\
    \ is attached to the trusted access network, it\n   can either be attached to\
    \ a foreign link in the trusted network or to\n   the home link directly.  This\
    \ document does not impose any\n   restrictions.\n"
