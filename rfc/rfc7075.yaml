- title: Abstract
  contents:
  - "Abstract\n   The Diameter protocol includes a capability for message redirection,\n\
    \   controlled by an application-independent \"redirect agent\".  In some\n  \
    \ circumstances, an operator may wish to redirect messages to an\n   alternate\
    \ domain without specifying individual hosts.  This document\n   specifies an\
    \ application-specific mechanism by which a Diameter\n   server or proxy (node)\
    \ can perform such a redirection when the\n   Straightforward-Naming Authority\
    \ Pointer (S-NAPTR) is not used for\n   dynamic peer discovery.  A node performing\
    \ this new function is\n   referred to as a \"Realm-based Redirect Server\".\n\
    \   This memo updates Sections 6.13 and 6.14 of RFC 6733 with respect to\n   the\
    \ usage of the Redirect-Host-Usage and Redirect-Max-Cache-Time\n   Attribute-Value\
    \ Pairs (AVPs).\n"

  - "1.  Introduction\n   The Diameter base protocol [RFC6733] specifies a basic redirection\n\
    \   service provided by a redirect agent.  The redirect indication\n   returned\
    \ by the redirect agent is described in Section 6.1.8 and\n   Sections 6.12 through\
    \ 6.14 of [RFC6733].  It provides one or more\n   individual hosts to the message\
    \ sender as the destination of the\n   redirected message.\n   However, consider\
    \ the case where an operator has offered a specific\n   service but no longer\
    \ wishes to do so.  The operator has arranged for\n   an alternative domain to\
    \ provide the service.  To aid in the\n   transition to the new arrangement, the\
    \ original operator maintains a\n   redirect server to indicate to the message\
    \ sender the alternative\n   domain to which the redirect the request should be\
    \ sent.  However,\n   the original operator should not have to configure the redirect\n\
    \   server with a list of hosts to contact in the alternative operator's\n   domain;\
    \ the original operator should simply be able to provide\n   redirect indications\
    \ to the domain as a whole.\n"
- title: 1.1.  Terminology
  contents:
  - "1.1.  Terminology\n   The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"\
    SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\"\
    , and \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n   document are to be interpreted as described in\
    \ [RFC2119].\n   Within this specification, the term \"realm-based redirection\"\
    \ is used\n   to refer to a mode of operation where a realm, rather than an\n\
    \   individual host, is returned as the redirect indication.\n   The term \"Realm-based\
    \ Redirect Server\" denotes the Diameter node\n   (Diameter server or proxy) that\
    \ returns the realm-based redirection.\n   The behavior of the Realm-based Redirect\
    \ Server itself is a slight\n   modification to the behavior of a basic redirect\
    \ agent as described\n   in Section 6.1.8 of [RFC6733].\n   The use of a number\
    \ of terms in this document is consistent with the\n   usage in [RFC6733]: \"\
    Diameter client\", \"Diameter node\", \"Diameter\n   peer\", \"Diameter server\"\
    , \"proxy\", \"realm\" or \"domain\", \"redirect\n   agent\", and \"session\"\
    \ as defined in Section 1.2, and \"application\" as\n   defined implicitly by\
    \ Sections 1.3.4, 2.3, and 2.4.\n"
- title: 2.  Support of Realm-Based Redirection Within Applications
  contents:
  - "2.  Support of Realm-Based Redirection Within Applications\n   The DNS-based\
    \ dynamic peer discovery mechanism defined in the\n   Diameter base protocol [RFC6733]\
    \ provides a simple mechanism for\n   realm-based redirection using the S-NAPTR\
    \ DDDS application [RFC3958].\n   When S-NAPTR is used for peer discovery, redirection\
    \ of Diameter\n   requests from the original realm to a new realm may be performed\
    \ by\n   updating the existing NAPTR resource records (RRs) for the original\n\
    \   realm as follows: the NAPTR RR for the desired application(s) and\n   supported\
    \ application protocol(s) provided by the new realm will have\n   an empty FLAG\
    \ field and the REPLACEMENT field will contain the new\n   realm to use for the\
    \ next DNS lookup.  The new realm can be\n   arbitrary; the restriction in [RFC6733]\
    \ that the NAPTR replacement\n   field match the domain of the original query\
    \ does not apply for\n   realm-based redirect purposes.\n   However, the use of\
    \ DNS-based dynamic peer discovery is optional for\n   Diameter implementations.\
    \  For deployments that do not make use of\n   S-NAPTR peer discovery, support\
    \ of realm-based redirection needs to\n   be specified as part of the functionality\
    \ supported by a Diameter\n   application.  In this way, support of the considered\
    \ Diameter\n   application (discovered during capabilities exchange phase as defined\n\
    \   in Diameter base protocol [RFC6733]) indicates implicit support of\n   the\
    \ realm-based redirection mechanism.  A new application\n   specification can\
    \ incorporate the mechanism specified here by making\n   it mandatory to implement\
    \ for the application and referencing this\n   specification normatively.\n  \
    \ The result of making realm-based redirection an application-specific\n   behavior\
    \ is that it cannot be performed by a redirect agent as\n   defined in [RFC6733],\
    \ but MUST be performed instead by an\n   application-aware Diameter node (Diameter\
    \ server or proxy) (hereafter\n   called a \"Realm-based Redirect Server\").\n\
    \   An application can specify that realm-based redirection operates only\n  \
    \ on complete sessions beginning with the initial message or on every\n   message\
    \ within the application, even if earlier messages of the same\n   session were\
    \ not redirected.  This distinction matters only when\n   realm-based redirection\
    \ is first initiated.  In the former case,\n   existing sessions will not be disrupted\
    \ by the deployment of realm-\n   based redirection.  In the latter case, existing\
    \ sessions will be\n   disrupted if they are stateful.\n"
- title: 3.  Realm-Based Redirection
  contents:
  - "3.  Realm-Based Redirection\n   This section specifies an extension of the Diameter\
    \ base protocol\n   [RFC6733] to achieve realm-based redirection.  The elements\
    \ of this\n   solution are:\n   o  a new result code, DIAMETER_REALM_REDIRECT_INDICATION\
    \ (3011);\n   o  a new attribute-value pair (AVP), Redirect-Realm (620); and\n\
    \   o  associated behavior at Diameter nodes implementing this\n      specification.\n\
    \   This behavior includes the optional use of the Redirect-Host-Usage\n   and\
    \ Redirect-Max-Cache-Time AVPs.  In this document, these AVPs apply\n   to the\
    \ peer discovered by a node acting on the redirect server's\n   response, an extension\
    \ to their normal usage as described in Sections\n   6.13 and 6.14 of [RFC6733].\n\
    \   Section 3.2.2 and Section 3.2.3 describe how a proxy or client may\n   update\
    \ its routing table for the application and initial realm as a\n   result of selecting\
    \ a peer in the new realm after realm-based\n   redirection.  Note that as a result,\
    \ the proxy or client will\n   automatically route subsequent requests for that\
    \ application to the\n   new realm (with the possible exception of requests within\
    \ sessions\n   already established with the initial realm) until the cached routing\n\
    \   entry expires.  This should be borne in mind if the rerouting is\n   intended\
    \ to be temporary.\n"

  contents:
  - "3.1.  Configuration of the Realm-Based Redirect Server\n   A Diameter node (Diameter\
    \ server or proxy) acting as a Realm-based\n   Redirect Server MUST be configured\
    \ as follows to execute realm-based\n   redirection:\n   o  configured with an\
    \ application that incorporates realm-based\n      redirection;\n   o  the Local\
    \ Action field of the routing table described in\n      Section 2.7 of [RFC6733]\
    \ is set to LOCAL;\n   o  an application-specific field is set to indicate that\
    \ the required\n      local action is to perform realm-based redirection;\n  \

  contents:
  - "3.2.1.  Behavior at the Realm-Based Redirect Server\n   As mentioned in Section\
    \ 2, an application can specify that realm-\n   based redirection operates only\
    \ on complete sessions beginning with\n   the initial message (i.e., to prevent\
    \ disruption of established\n   sessions) or on every message within the application,\
    \ even if earlier\n   messages of the same session were not redirected.\n   If\
    \ a Realm-based Redirect Server configured as described in\n   Section 3.1 receives\
    \ a request to which realm-based redirection\n   applies, the Realm-based Redirect\
    \ Server MUST reply with an answer\n   message with the 'E' bit set, while maintaining\
    \ the Hop-by-Hop\n   Identifier in the header.  The Realm-based Redirect Server\
    \ MUST\n   include the Result-Code AVP set to\n   DIAMETER_REALM_REDIRECT_INDICATION.\

  contents:
  - "4.  Security Considerations\n   The general recommendations given in Section\
    \ 13 of the Diameter base\n   protocol [RFC6733] apply.  Specific security recommendations\
    \ related\n   to the realm-based redirection defined in this document are described\n\
    \   below.\n   Realm-based redirection implies a change in the business relationship\n\
    \   between organizations.  Before redirecting a request towards a realm\n   different\
    \ from the initial realm, the client or proxy MUST ensure\n   that the authorization\
    \ checks have been performed at each connection\n   along the path toward the\
    \ realm identified in the realm-based\n   redirect indication.  Details on Diameter\
    \ authorization path set-up\n   are given in Section 2.9 of [RFC6733].  Section\
    \ 13 of [RFC6733]\n   provides recommendations on how to authenticate and secure\
    \ each peer-\n   to-peer connection (using TLS, DTLS, or IPsec) along the way,\
    \ thus\n   permitting the necessary hop-by-hop authorization checks.\n   Although\
    \ it is assumed that the administrative domains are secure, a\n   compromised\
    \ Diameter node acting as a Realm-based Redirect Server\n   would be able to redirect\
    \ a large number of Diameter requests towards\n   a victim domain that would then\
    \ be flooded with undesired Diameter\n   requests.  Such an attack is nevertheless\
    \ discouraged by the use of\n   secure Diameter peer-to-peer connections and authorization\
    \ checks,\n   since these would enable a potential victim domain to discover from\n\
    \   where an attack is coming.  That in itself, however, does not prevent\n  \
    \ such a DoS attack.\n   Because realm-based redirection defined in this document\
    \ implies that\n   the Destination-Realm AVP in a client-initiated request can\
    \ be\n   changed by a Diameter proxy in the path between the client and the\n\
    \   server, any cryptographic algorithm that would use the Destination-\n   Realm\
    \ AVP as input to the calculation performed by the client and the\n   server would\
    \ be broken by this form of redirection.  Application\n   specifications that\
    \ would rely on such cryptographic algorithms\n   SHOULD NOT incorporate this\
