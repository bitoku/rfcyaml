    \   technical specification, RFC 1798, was published in 1995 as a\n   Proposed\
    \ Standard.  This document discusses the reasons why the CLDAP\n   technical specification\
    \ has not been furthered on the Standard Track.\n   This document recommends that\
    \ RFC 1798 be moved to Historic status.\n"

  - "1. Background\n   Connection-less Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (CLDAP)\n\
    \   [RFC1798] was published in 1995 as a Proposed Standard.  The protocol\n  \
    \ was targeted at applications which require lookup of small amounts of\n   information\
    \ held in the directory.  The protocol avoids the overhead\n   of establishing\
    \ (and closing) a connection and the session bind and\n   unbind operations needed\
    \ in connection-oriented directory access\n   protocols.  The CLDAP was designed\
    \ to complement version 2 of the\n   Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAPv2)\
    \ [RFC1777], now\n   Historic [HISTORIC].\n   In the seven years since its publication,\
    \ CLDAP has not become widely\n   deployed on the Internet.  There are a number\
    \ of probable reasons for\n   this:\n   - Limited functionality:\n        + anonymous\
    \ only,\n        + read only,\n        + small result sizes only, and\n   - Insufficient\
    \ security capabilities:\n        + no integrity protection,\n        + no confidentiality\
    \ protection\n   - Inadequate internationalization support;\n   - Insufficient\
    \ extensibility; and\n   - Lack of multiple independently developed implementations.\n\
    \   The CLDAP technical specification has normative references to\n   multiple\
    \ obsolete technical specifications including X.501(88),\n   X.511(88), RFC 1487\
    \ (the predecessor to RFC 1777, the now Historic\n   LDAPv2 technical specification).\
    \  Unless the technical specification\n   were to be updated, CLDAP cannot remain\
    \ on the standards track\n   because of the Normative reference to a Historic\
    \ RFC.\n   The community recognized in the mid-1990s that CLDAP needed to be\n\
    \   updated.  In response to this, the IETF chartered the LDAP Extensions\n  \
    \ Working Group (LDAPext WG) in 1997 to undertake this update.  The\n   LDAPext\
    \ WG is concluding without producing an update to CLDAP.\n   Currently, there\
    \ is no standardization effort to update CLDAP.\n   It should be noted that the\
    \ community still has interest in\n   developing a \"connection-less\" directory\
    \ access protocol.  However,\n   based on operational experience, has determined\
    \ that further\n   experimentation is necessary to address outstanding technical\
    \ issues.\n   In particular, security considerations associated with\n   \"connection-less\"\
    \ services need to be addressed.\n"

  contents:
  - "2. Recommendation\n   As there is no viable standardization effort to update\
    \ CLDAP as\n   necessary to keep it on the standards track and the community\n\
    \   currently considers this an area requiring further experimentation,\n   RFC\
    \ 1798 must be moved to Historic status.\n   It is recommended that those interested\
    \ in connection-less access to\n   X.500-based directory services experiment with\
    \ [LDAPUDP] and other\n   alternatives which might become available.\n"
