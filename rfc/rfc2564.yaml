  - "1.  Introduction and Overview\n   This document furthers the work begun in the\
    \ systems application MIB\n   [31].\n   The development of the \"Host Resources\
    \ MIB\" [10], \"Network Services\n   Monitoring MIB\" [23], \"Mail Monitoring\
    \ MIB\" [24], \"Relational\n   Database Management System (RDBMS) Management Information\
    \ Base (MIB)\n   using SMIv2\" [12], \"Entity MIB using SMIv2\" [20], and \"Applicability\n\
    \   of Standards Track MIBs to Management of World Wide Web Servers\" [21]\n \
    \  provides us with a base of experience in making a variety of\n   applications\
    \ visible to management; this specification abstracts out\n   the common aspects\
    \ of applications management and provides a generic\n   base usable for the management\
    \ of almost any application.\n   The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\"\
    , \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \
    \ \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n   document are to be interpreted as described\
    \ in RFC 2119 [22].\n   Due to the design decision to not require application\n\
    \   instrumentation, many important topics were not handled in system\n   application\
    \ MIB [31].  The following topics are within the scope of\n   this document:\n\
    \     -      Support for generic application throughput measurements;\n     -\
    \      Providing MIB definitions that allow managed entities to\n            report\
    \ what they considered to be units of work;\n     -      Providing support for\
    \ generic application response time\n            monitoring capabilities; (Note\
    \ that APIs for this purpose\n            have already been developed, an example\
    \ of such an API is to\n            be found in the \"Application Response Measurement\
    \ (ARM) API\n            Guide, Version 2\" [1].)\n     -      Provide explicit\
    \ support for the management of applications\n            distributed within a\
    \ single managed system (\"local\"\n            distribution);\n     -      Address\
    \ generic resource management issues, including:\n            -      files in\
    \ use;\n            -      I/O statistics (from the application's perspective,\n\
    \                   not at the operating system or device driver level);\n   \
    \         -      application-layer networking resource usage\n     -      Facilities\
    \ for the control of applications, including:\n            -      Stopping application\
    \ elements\n            -      Suspending and resuming application elements;\n\
    \            -      Requesting reconfiguration (e.g., SIGHUP).\n   Note that these\
    \ issues are addressed at least in part by other (non-\n   IETF) standards work,\
    \ including \"ITU-T Recommendation X.744 | ISO/IEC\n   IS 10164-18:1996\" [3]\
    \ and \"IEEE P1387.2, POSIX System Administration\n   - Part 2: Software Administration\"\

- title: 2.  The SNMP Management Framework
  contents:
  - "2.  The SNMP Management Framework\n   The SNMP Management Framework presently\
    \ consists of five major\n   components:\n     An overall architecture, described\
    \ in RFC 2571 [26].\n     Mechanisms for describing and naming objects and events\
    \ for the\n     purpose of management.  The first version of this Structure of\n\
    \     Management Information (SMI) is called SMIv1 and described in STD\n    \
    \ 16, RFC 1155 [4], STD 16, RFC 1212 [6] and RFC 1215 [7].  The\n     second version,\
    \ called SMIv2, is described in STD 58, RFC 2578\n     [15], RFC 2579 [16] and\
    \ RFC 2580 [17].\n     Message protocols for transferring management information.\
    \  The\n     first version of the SNMP message protocol is called SNMPv1 and\n\
    \     described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [5].  A second version of the SNMP\n     message\
    \ protocol, which is not an Internet standards track\n     protocol, is called\
    \ SNMPv2c and described in RFC 1901 [14] and RFC\n     1906 [19].  The third version\
    \ of the message protocol is called\n     SNMPv3 and described in RFC 1906 [19],\
    \ RFC 2572 [27] and RFC 2574\n     [29].\n     Protocol operations for accessing\
    \ management information.  The\n     first set of protocol operations and associated\
    \ PDU formats is\n     described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [5].  A second set of protocol\n\
    \     operations and associated PDU formats is described in RFC 1905\n     [18].\n\
    \     A set of fundamental applications described in RFC 2573 [28] and\n     the\
    \ view-based access control mechanism described in RFC 2575 [30].\n   Managed\
    \ objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed\n   the Management\
    \ Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are\n   defined using the mechanisms\
    \ defined in the SMI.\n   This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to\
    \ the SMIv2.  A\n   MIB conforming to the SMIv1 can be produced through the appropriate\n\
    \   translations.  The resulting translated MIB must be semantically\n   equivalent,\
    \ except where objects or events are omitted because no\n   translation is possible\
    \ (use of Counter64).  Some machine readable\n   information in SMIv2 will be\
    \ converted into textual descriptions in\n   SMIv1 during the translation process.\
    \  However, this loss of machine\n   readable information is not considered to\
    \ change the semantics of the\n   MIB.\n"
- title: 3.  Architecture
  contents:
  - "3.  Architecture\n   Object-oriented modeling techniques like subclassing and\
    \ multiple\n   inheritance can be emulated in the SNMP information model through\
    \ the\n   use of tables with common indexes.\n   The challenge for the developer\
    \ of management applications is to\n   recognize those situations in which various\
    \ aspects of a single\n   logical resource are represented in several different\
    \ tables,\n   possibly defined in different MIBs.\n   Most of the management information\
    \ defined here may pertain to any\n   number of applications in a managed system.\
    \  The simplest way of\n   supporting this requirement within the SNMP information\
    \ model is to\n   use tables.  This means that the management information for\
    \ a\n   particular resource may be found in one or more rows of one or more\n\
    \   tables; the fact that this information pertains to a single resource\n   may\
    \ be inferred from the index values used, possibly with the support\n   of mapping\
    \ tables.  This also means that a single table may contain\n   management information\
    \ relevant to a number of applications.  This\n   has significant implementation\
    \ implications; see the implementation\n   issues section below for more information.\n"
- title: 3.1.  Relationships to other MIBs
  contents:
  - "3.1.  Relationships to other MIBs\n   This section outlines the relationships\
    \ of the components of this MIB\n   (usually in the form of common indexing structures)\
    \ to:\n     -      the systems applications MIB [31]\n     -      the host resources\
    \ MIB [10]\n     -      the network services monitoring MIB [23]\n"
- title: 3.1.1.  Relationship to the System Application MIB
  contents:
  - "3.1.1.  Relationship to the System Application MIB\n   The system application\
    \ MIB defines attributes for management of\n   applications which can be realized\
    \ without instrumenting the\n   application itself.  This specification extends\
    \ that framework to\n   include additional attributes which will typically require\n\
    \   instrumentation within the managed resource.  The sysApplRunElmtIndex\n  \
    \ is the key connection between these two MIBs; it is essential that\n   implementations\
    \ of this MIB and of the system applications MIB\n   running concurrently on a\
    \ given platform employ a consistent policy\n   for assigning this value to identify\
    \ running application elements.\n"
- title: 3.1.2.  Relationship to the Host Resources MIB
  contents:
  - "3.1.2.  Relationship to the Host Resources MIB\n   The Host Resources MIB [10]\
    \ supplies information on the hardware,\n   operating system, installed and running\
    \ software on a host.\n   The Host Resources MIB has three hardware groups (\"\
    hrSystem\",\n   \"hrStorage\" and \"hrDevice\") and three software groups (\"\
    hrSWRun\",\n   \"hrSWRunPerf\" and \"hrSWInstalled\").  Of these, the software\
    \ groups\n   are of greatest significance to this MIB.\n   The software groups\
    \ define management information on the software\n   used in the system. The information\
    \ provided is grouped into (1) the\n   currently running, (2) the performance\
    \ and (3) the installed\n   applications.\n   The index \"hrSWRunIndex\" used\
    \ in the \"hrSWRunTable\" and other tables\n   to identify running software by\
    \ process identifier (or equivalent)\n   relates information in the Host Resources\
    \ MIB to information in the\n   System Applications MIB and this MIB. It is essential\
    \ that the values\n   assigned to hrSWRunIndex from the Host Resources MIB be\
    \ consistent\n   with the values used for sysApplRunElmtIndex.\n"
- title: 3.1.3.  Relationship to NSM
  contents:
  - "3.1.3.  Relationship to NSM\n   The Network Services Monitoring MIB [23] is defined\
    \ as the base set\n   of attributes for managing network applications.  The Application\
    \ MIB\n   includes information normally obtainable only from the managed\n   resource\
    \ itself, rather than the supporting system.  Due to\n   differences in index\
    \ representation, the relationship between the\n   Network Services Monitoring\
    \ MIB and the Application MIB is not\n   formally defined.\n"
- title: 4.  MIB Structure
  contents:
  - "4.  MIB Structure\n   This MIB is organized into several groups, which in turn\
    \ are\n   organized into tables to provide the monitoring and control of\n   information\
    \ relevant to the management of applications.  The groups\n   model:\n     - \
    \     the service-level view of applications\n     -      information on open\
    \ channels (files, connections,\n            transaction streams) in use by applications\n\
    \     -      historical information on former channels\n     -      process-level\
    \ status and control information\n   These groups are organized into various tables.\
    \  Information for a\n   particular running managed application appears in the\
    \ form of entries\n   in the appropriate tables.  The tables are:\n     -    \
    \  the tables providing a service-level view, including:\n            -      the\
    \ service name to service instance table\n            -      the service instance\
    \ to service name table\n            -      the service instance to running application\
    \ element\n                   table\n            -      the running application\
    \ element to service instance\n                   table\n     -      the tables\
    \ providing information on I/O channels, including:\n            -      the table\
    \ of open channels\n            -      the table of open files\n            -\
    \      the open connections table\n            -      the transaction statistics\
    \ tables\n     -      historical information on I/O channels\n     -      the\
    \ running application element status and control group\n            -      the\
    \ running application element status table\n            -      the running application\
    \ element control table\n   In order to support SNMPv1, SNMPv2, and SNMPv3 environments,\
    \ in cases\n   where counter objects may potentially advance very rapidly, where\n\
    \   sixty-four bit counters have been used thirty-two bit counters\n   reporting\
    \ the low-order thirty-two bits of the value have also been\n   defined.\n   Since\
    \ rows in most of these tables will come and go with the running\n   application\
    \ elements whose information is contained in them,\n   sysUpTime.0 is not appropriate\
    \ as a discontinuity indicator for\n   counters in these tables.  By defining\
    \ separate discontinuity\n   indicators for the rows in these tables, entries\
    \ can come and go as\n   needed without causing other objects to appear to have\n\
    \   discontinuities.  As required by [15], the discontinuity indicators\n   for\
    \ the various information objects in these tables are identified in\n   the relevant\
    \ DESCRIPTION clauses.  Note that a discontinuity in one\n   of these counters\
    \ does not imply a sysUpTime.0 discontinuity, nor\n   does a sysUpTime.0 discontinuity\
    \ imply a discontinuity in any of\n   these counters.\n"
- title: 4.1.  The service-level tables
  contents:
  - "4.1.  The service-level tables\n   The service-level tables permit the identification\
    \ of one or more\n   instances of named services on a system, and the association\
    \ of\n   running application elements to these services.\n   Service names are\
    \ represented as human-readable strings, using values\n   assigned by IANA where\
    \ possible.  The allocation of unique values for\n   service instance identifiers\
    \ is a local administrative issue; the\n   values allocated must be constant for\
    \ the lifetime of the service\n   instance, and re-use of values should be avoided.\n\
    \   It is important to understand that a service is not the same thing as\n  \
    \ a protocol.  Rather, some services may be at least partially\n   described by\
    \ the protocol(s) used to provide that service.\n   In deciding what should or\
    \ should not be considered a service, the\n   following factors merit consideration:\n\
    \     -      is there an identifiable set of resources associated with\n     \
    \       providing this service?\n     -      is there a reasonably long-lived\
    \ server or client process?\n   Following this reasoning, one can see where SMTP\
    \ and HTTP service\n   providers would be good candidates for classification as\
    \ services for\n   purposes of application management, where finger probably would\
    \ not.\n   Of course, implementors of this MIB are free to define additional\n\
    \   services.  An applicability statement may be an appropriate vehicle\n   for\
    \ standardizing how a specific service's information is reported\n   using this\
    \ MIB.\n"

    \ be structured as\n   transactions.  When the information flow on a channel is\

    \ or file) in\n   the context of a running application element or service instance.\n\
    \   The transaction stream summary table contains per-stream summaries of\n  \
    \ transaction statistics.  The transaction flow statistics table\n   contains\

    \   application, the sysApplRunTable to find the running instances of\n   that\
    \ application, and the sysApplElmtRunTable to find the relevant\n   values of\
    \ sysApplElmtRunIndex.  The manager, armed with a set of\n   values for sysApplElmtRunIndex,\
    \ is now able to retrieve the relevant\n   portions of the applOpenFileTable and\
    \ other tables in this MIB.\n   The following information is available in this\
    \ table:\n     -      file name\n     -      file size\n     -      current mode\
    \ (read/write) of this file\n   By convention, the names \"stdin\", \"stdout\"\
    \ and \"stderr\" are used when\n   these streams cannot be resolved to actual\
    \ file names.\n"

- title: 6.  Implementation Issues
  contents:
  - "6.  Implementation Issues\n   Unlike the system application MIB [31], in many\
    \ environments support\n   for much of this MIB requires instrumentation built\
    \ into the managed\n   resource.  Some tables may be implemented by a single monitor\n\
    \   process; for others, the implementation may be distributed within the\n  \
    \ managed system with the resources being managed.\n   As a practical matter,\
    \ this means that the management infrastructure\n   of the managed system must\
    \ support different subagents taking\n   responsibility for different rows of\
    \ a single table.  This can be\n   supported by AgentX [25], as well as some other\
    \ subagent protocols\n   such as [8], [9], and [11].\n   The sysApplRunElmtIndex\
    \ is the key connection between this MIB and\n   the systems application MIB.\
    \  Implementations of these two MIBs\n   intended to run concurrently on a given\
    \ platform must employ a\n   consistent policy for assigning this value to running\
    \ application\n   elements.\n   Some of the objects defined in this MIB may carry\
    \ a high run-time\n   cost in some environments.  For example, tracking transaction\
    \ elapsed\n   time could be expensive if it required two kernel calls (start and\n\
    \   finish) per transaction.  Similarly, maintaining tables of per-\n   transaction\
    \ information, rather than aggregating information by\n   transaction type or\
    \ transaction stream, could have significant\n   storage and performance impacts.\n\
    \   Unless a collision-free mechanism for allocating service instance\n   indexes\
    \ is in place, the structure of the service-level tables makes\n   an index-reservation\
    \ mechanism necessary.  AgentX [25] is an example\n   of a subagent protocol capable\
    \ of satisfying this requirement.\n"

- title: 9.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "9.  Security Considerations\n   By making potentially sensitive information externally\
    \ accessible,\n   the capabilities supported by the MIB have the potential of\
    \ becoming\n   security problems.  How security fits into SNMP frameworks is\n\
    \   described in [26], and a specific access control model is described\n   in\
    \ [30].\n   The tables in this MIB are organized to separate sensitive control\n\
    \   capabilities from less sensitive usage information.  For example, the\n  \
    \ objects to control application suspend/resume are separated from\n   those to\
    \ handle reconfiguration, which in turn are distinct from\n   those for termination.\
    \  This recognizes the need to support\n   configurations where the level of authorization\
    \ needed by a manager\n   to do a \"reconfigure\" might be substantially less\
    \ than the level\n   needed to terminate an application element.  By keeping these\
    \ in\n   separate columns, we make it possible to set up access control that\n\
    \   allows, for example, \"reconfigure\" but not \"kill\".\n   The MIB is structured\
    \ to be useful for managers with read-only access\n   rights.  In some environments,\
    \ it may be approprate to restrict even\n   read-only access to these MIBs.\n\
    \   The capabilities supported by this MIB include several that may be of\n  \
    \ value to a security administrator.  These include the ability to\n   monitor\
    \ the level of usage of a given application, and to check the\n   integrity of\
    \ application components.\n"
