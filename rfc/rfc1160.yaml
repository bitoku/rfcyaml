  - "1. Introduction\n   In 1968, the U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency\
    \ (DARPA)\n   initiated an effort to develop a technology which is now known as\n\
    \   packet switching.  This technology had its roots in message switching\n  \
    \ methods, but was strongly influenced by the development of low-cost\n   minicomputers\
    \ and digital telecommunications techniques during the\n   mid-1960's [BARAN 64,\
    \ ROBERTS 70, HEART 70, ROBERTS 78].  A very\n   useful survey of this technology\
    \ can be found in [IEEE 78].\n   During the early 1970's, DARPA initiated a number\
    \ of programs to\n   explore the use of packet switching methods in alternative\
    \ media\n   including mobile radio, satellite and cable [IEEE 78].  Concurrently,\n\
    \   Xerox Palo Alto Research Center (PARC) began an exploration of packet\n  \
    \ switching on coaxial cable which ultimately led to the development of\n   Ethernet\
    \ local area networks [METCALFE 76].\n   The successful implementation of packet\
    \ radio and packet satellite\n   technology raised the question of interconnecting\
    \ ARPANET with other\n   types of packet nets.  A possible solution to this problem\
    \ was\n   proposed by Cerf and Kahn [CERF 74] in the form of an internetwork\n\
    \   protocol and a set of gateways to connect the different networks.\n   This\
    \ solution was further developed as part of a research program in\n   internetting\
    \ sponsored by DARPA and resulted in a collection of\n   computer communications\
    \ protocols based on the original Transmission\n   Control Protocol (TCP) and\
    \ its lower level counterpart, Internet\n   Protocol (IP).  Together, these protocols,\
    \ along with many others\n   developed during the course of the research, are\
    \ referred to as the\n   TCP/IP Protocol Suite [RFC 1140, LEINER 85, POSTEL 85,\
    \ CERF 82, CLARK\n   86].\n   In the early stages of the Internet research program,\
    \ only a few\n   researchers worked to develop and test versions of the internet\n\
    \   protocols.  Over time, the size of this activity increased until, in\n   1979,\
    \ it was necessary to form an informal committee to guide the\n   technical evolution\
    \ of the protocol suite.  This group was called the\n   Internet Configuration\
    \ Control Board (ICCB) and was established by\n   Dr. Vinton Cerf who was then\
    \ the DARPA program manager for the\n   effort. Dr. David C. Clark of the Laboratory\
    \ for Computer Science at\n   Massachusetts Institute of Technology was named\
    \ the chairman of this\n   committee.\n   In January, 1983, the Defense Communications\
    \ Agency, then responsible\n   for the operation of the ARPANET, declared the\
    \ TCP/IP protocol suite\n   to be standard for the ARPANET and all systems on\
    \ the network\n   converted from the earlier Network Control Program (NCP) to\
    \ TCP/IP.\n   Late that year, the ICCB was reorganized by Dr. Barry Leiner, Cerf's\n\
    \   successor at DARPA, around a series of task forces considering\n   different\
    \ technical aspects of internetting.  The re-organized group\n   was named the\
    \ Internet Activities Board.\n   As the Internet expanded, it drew support from\
    \ U.S. Government\n   organizations including DARPA, the National Science Foundation\
    \ (NSF),\n   the Department of Energy (DOE) and the National Aeronautics and Space\n\
    \   Administration (NASA).  Key managers in these organizations,\n   responsible\
    \ for computer networking research and development, formed\n   an informal Federal\
    \ Research Internet Coordinating Committee (FRICC)\n   to coordinate U.S. Government\
    \ support for and development and use of\n   the Internet system.  The FRICC sponsored\
    \ most of the U.S. research\n   on internetting, including support for the Internet\
    \ Activities Board\n   and its subsidiary organizations.\n   In 1990, the FRICC\
    \ was reorganized as part of a larger initiative\n   sponsored by the networking\
    \ subcommittee of the Federal Coordinating\n   Committee on Science, Engineering\
    \ and Technology (FCCSET).  The\n   reorganization created the Federal Networking\
    \ Council (FNC) and its\n   Working Groups.  The membership of the FNC included\
    \ all the former\n   FRICC members and many other U.S. Government representatives.\
    \  The\n   first chairman of the FNC is Dr. Charles Brownstein of the National\n\
    \   Science Foundation.  The FNC is the Federal Government's body for\n   coordinating\
    \ the agencies that support the Internet.  It provides\n   liaison to the Office\
    \ of Science and Technology Policy (headed by the\n   President's Science Advisor)\
    \ which is responsible for setting science\n   and technology policy affecting\
    \ the Internet.  It endorses and\n   employs the existing planning and operational\
    \ activities of the\n   community-based bodies that have grown up to manage the\
    \ Internet in\n   the United States.  The FNC plans to involve user and supplier\n\
    \   communities through creation of an external advisory board and will\n   coordinate\
    \ Internet activities with other Federal initiatives ranging\n   from the Human\
    \ Genome and Global Change programs to educational\n   applications.  The FNC\
    \ has also participated in planning for the\n   creation of a National Research\
    \ and Education Network in the United\n   States.\n   At the international level,\
    \ a Coordinating Committee for\n   Intercontinental Research Networks (CCIRN)\
    \ has been formed which\n   includes the U.S. FNC and its counterparts in North\
    \ America and\n   Europe.  Co-chaired by the executive directors of the FNC and\
    \ the\n   European Association of Research Networks (RARE), the CCIRN provides\n\
    \   a forum for cooperative planning among the principal North American\n   and\
    \ European research networking bodies.\n"

  - "2. Internet Activities Board\n   The Internet Activities Board (IAB) is the coordinating\
    \ committee for\n   Internet design, engineering and management.  The Internet\
    \ is a\n   collection of over two thousand of packet switched networks located\n\
    \   principally in the U.S., but also in many other parts of the world,\n   all\
    \ interlinked and operating using the protocols of the TCP/IP\n   protocol suite.\
    \  The IAB is an independent committee of researchers\n   and professionals with\
    \ a technical interest in the health and\n   evolution of the Internet system.\
    \  Membership changes with time to\n   adjust to the current realities of the\
    \ research interests of the\n   participants, the needs of the Internet system\
    \ and the concerns of\n   constituent members of the Internet.\n   IAB members\
    \ are deeply committed to making the Internet function\n   effectively and evolve\
    \ to meet a large scale, high speed future.  New\n   members are appointed by\
    \ the chairman of the IAB, with the advice and\n   consent of the remaining members.\
    \  The chairman serves a term of two\n   years and is elected by the members of\
    \ the IAB.  The IAB focuses on\n   the TCP/IP protocol suite, and extensions to\
    \ the Internet system to\n   support multiple protocol suites.\n   The IAB has\
    \ two principal subsidiary task forces:\n      1)  Internet Engineering Task Force\
    \ (IETF)\n      2)  Internet Research Task Force (IRTF)\n   Each of these Task\
    \ Forces is led by a chairman and guided by a\n   Steering Group which reports\
    \ to the IAB through its chairman.  Each\n   task force is organized, by the chairman,\
    \ as required, to carry out\n   its charter.  For the most part, a collection\
    \ of Working Groups\n   carries out the work program of each Task Force.\n   All\
    \ decisions of the IAB are made public.  The principal vehicle by\n   which IAB\
    \ decisions are propagated to the parties interested in the\n   Internet and its\
    \ TCP/IP protocol suite is the Request for Comment\n   (RFC) note series.  The\
    \ archival RFC series was initiated in 1969 by\n   Dr. Stephen D. Crocker as a\
    \ means of documenting the development of\n   the original ARPANET protocol suite\
    \ [RFC 1000].  The editor-in-chief\n   of this series, Dr. Jonathan B. Postel,\
    \ has maintained the quality of\n   and managed the archiving of this series since\
    \ its inception.  A\n   small proportion of the RFCs document Internet standards.\
    \  Most of\n   them are intended to stimulate comment and discussion.  The small\n\
    \   number which document standards are especially marked in a \"status\"\n  \
    \ section to indicate the special status of the document.  An RFC\n   summarizing\
    \ the status of all standard RFCs is published regularly\n   [RFC 1140].\n   RFCs\
    \ describing experimental protocols, along with other submissions\n   whose intent\
    \ is merely to inform, are typically submitted directly to\n   the RFC editor.\
    \  A Standard Protocol starts out as a Proposed\n   Standard and may be promoted\
    \ to Draft Standard and finally Standard\n   after suitable review, comment, implementation\
    \ and testing.\n   Prior to publication of a Proposed Standard RFC, it is made\
    \ available\n   for comment through an on-line Internet-Draft directory.  Typically,\n\
    \   these Internet-Drafts are working documents of the IAB or of the\n   working\
    \ groups of the Internet Engineering and Research Task Forces.\n   Internet-Drafts\
    \ are either submitted to the RFC editor for\n   publication or discarded within\
    \ 3-6 months.  Prior to promotion to\n   Draft Standard or Standard, an Internet-Draft\
    \ publication and review\n   cycle may be initiated if significant changes to\
    \ the RFC are\n   contemplated.\n   The IAB performs the following functions:\n\
    \      1)   Sets Internet Standards,\n      2)   Manages the RFC publication process,\n\
    \      3)   Reviews the operation of the IETF and IRTF,\n      4)   Performs strategic\
    \ planning for the Internet, identifying\n           long-range problems and opportunities,\n\
    \      5)   Acts as an international technical policy liaison and\n          \
    \ representative for the Internet community, and\n      6)   Resolves technical\
    \ issues which cannot be treated within\n           the IETF or IRTF frameworks.\n\
    \   To supplement its work via electronic mail, the IAB meets quarterly\n   to\
    \ review the condition of the Internet, to review and approve\n   proposed changes\
    \ or additions to the TCP/IP suite of protocols, to\n   set technical development\
    \ priorities, to discuss policy matters which\n   may need the attention of the\
    \ Internet sponsors, and to agree on the\n   addition or retirement of IAB members\
    \ and on the addition or\n   retirement of task forces reporting to the IAB. \
    \ Typically, two of\n   the quarterly meetings are by means of video teleconferencing\n\
    \   (provided, when possible, through the experimental Internet packet\n   video-conferencing\
    \ system).  The minutes of the IAB meetings are\n   published in the Internet\

  - "3.  The Internet Engineering Task Force\n   The Internet has grown to encompass\
    \ a large number of widely\n   geographically dispersed networks in academic and\

    \  To help coordinate the operation, management and\n   evolution of the Internet,\
    \ the IAB established the Internet\n   Engineering Task Force (IETF).  The IETF\
    \ is chaired by Mr. Phillip\n   Gross and managed by its Internet Engineering\

    \ open community of\n   network designers, operators, vendors, and researchers\
    \ concerned with\n   the Internet and the Internet protocol suite.  It is organized\
    \ around\n   a set of eight technical areas, each managed by a technical area\n\
    \   director.  In addition to the IETF Chairman, the area directors make\n   up\
    \ the IESG membership.  Each area director has primary\n   responsibility for\

  - "4.  The Internet Research Task Force\n   To promote research in networking and\
    \ the development of new\n   technology, the IAB established the Internet Research\
    \ Task Force\n   (IRTF).\n   In the area of network protocols, the distinction\
    \ between research\n   and engineering is not always clear, so there will sometimes\
    \ be\n   overlap between activities of the IETF and the IRTF.  There is, in\n\
    \   fact, considerable overlap in membership between the two groups.\n   This\
    \ overlap is regarded as vital for cross-fertilization and\n   technology transfer.\
    \  In general, the distinction between research\n   and engineering is one of\
    \ viewpoint and sometimes (but not always)\n   time-frame.  The IRTF is generally\
    \ more concerned with understanding\n   than with products or standard protocols,\
    \ although specific\n   experimental protocols may have to be developed, implemented\
    \ and\n   tested in order to gain understanding.\n   The IRTF is a community of\
    \ network researchers, generally with an\n   Internet focus.  The work of the\
    \ IRTF is governed by its Internet\n   Research Steering Group (IRSG).  The chairman\
    \ of the IRTF and IRSG is\n   David Clark.  The IRTF is organized into a number\

- title: 5.  The Near-term Agenda of the IAB
  contents:
  - "5.  The Near-term Agenda of the IAB\n   There are seven principal foci of IAB\
    \ attention for the period 1989 -\n   1990:\n      1) Operational Stability\n\
    \      2) User Services\n      3) OSI Coexistence\n      4) Testbed Facilities\n\
    \      5) Security\n      6) Getting Big\n      7) Getting Fast\n   Operational\
    \ stability of the Internet is a critical concern for all\n   of its users.  Better\
    \ tools are needed for gathering operational\n   data, to assist in fault isolation\
    \ at all levels and to analyze the\n   performance of the system.  Opportunities\
    \ abound for increased\n   cooperation among the operators of the various Internet\
    \ components\n   [RFC 1109].  Specific, known problems should be dealt with, such\
    \ as\n   implementation deficiencies in some versions of the BIND domain name\n\
    \   service resolver software.  To the extent that the existing Exterior\n   Gateway\
    \ Protocol (EGP) is only able to support limited topologies,\n   constraints on\
    \ topological linkages and allowed transit paths should\n   be enforced until\
    \ a more general Inter-Autonomous System routing\n   protocol can be specified.\
    \  Flexiblity for Internet implementation\n   would be enhanced by the adoption\
    \ of a common internal gateway\n   routing protocol by all vendors of internet\
    \ routers.  A major effort\n   is recommended to achieve conformance to the Host\
    \ Requirements RFCs\n   which were published in the fourth quarter of calendar\
    \ 1989.\n   Among the most needed user services, the White Pages (electronic\n\
    \   mailbox directory service) seems the most pressing.  Efforts should\n   be\
    \ focused on widespread deployment of these capabilities in the\n   Internet by\
    \ mid-1990.  The IAB recommends that existing white pages\n   facilities and newer\
    \ ones, such as X.500, be populated with up-to-\n   date user information and\
    \ made accessible to Internet users and users\n   of other systems (e.g., commercial\
    \ email carriers) linked to the\n   Internet. Connectivity with commercial electronic\
    \ mail carriers\n   should be vigorously pursued, as well as links to other network\n\
    \   research communities in Europe and the rest of the world.\n   Development\
    \ and deployment of privacy-enhanced electronic mail\n   software should be accelerated\
    \ in 1990 after release of public domain\n   software implementing the private\
    \ electronic mail standards [RFC\n   1113, RFC 1114 and RFC 1115].  Finally, support\
    \ for new or enhanced\n   applications such as computer-based conferencing, multi-media\n\
    \   messaging and collaboration support systems should be developed.\n   The National\
    \ Network Testbed (NNT) resources planned by the FRICC\n   should be applied to\
    \ support conferencing and collaboration protocol\n   development and application\
    \ experiments and to support multi-vendor\n   router interoperability testing\
    \ (e.g., interior and exterior routing,\n   network management, multi-protocol\
    \ routing and forwarding).\n   With respect to growth in the Internet, architectural\
    \ attention\n   should be focused on scaling the system to hundreds of millions\
    \ of\n   users and hundreds of thousands of networks.  The naming, addressing,\n\
    \   routing and navigation problems occasioned by such growth should be\n   analyzed.\
    \  Similarly, research should be carried out on analyzing the\n   limits to the\
    \ existing Internet architecture, including the ability\n   of the present protocol\
    \ suite to cope with speeds in the gigabit\n   range and latencies varying from\
    \ microseconds to seconds in duration.\n   The Internet should be positioned to\
    \ support the use of OSI protocols\n   by the end of 1990 or sooner, if possible.\
    \  Provision for multi-\n   protocol routing and forwarding among diverse vendor\
    \ routes is one\n   important goal.  Introduction of X.400 electronic mail services\
    \ and\n   interoperation with RFC 822/SMTP [RFC 822, RFC 821, RFC 987, RFC\n \
    \  1026, and RFC 1148] should be targeted for 1990 as well.  These\n   efforts\
    \ will need to work in conjunction with the White Pages\n   services mentioned\
    \ above.  The IETF, in particular, should establish\n   liaison with various OSI\
    \ working groups (e.g., at NIST, RARE, Network\n   Management Forum) to coordinate\
    \ planning for OSI introduction into\n   the Internet and to facilitate registration\
    \ of information pertinent\n   to the Internet with the various authorities responsible\
    \ for OSI\n   standards in the United States.\n   Finally, with respect to security,\
    \ a concerted effort should be made\n   to develop guidance and documentation\
    \ for Internet host managers\n   concerning configuration management, known security\
    \ problems (and\n   their solutions) and software and technologies available to\
    \ provide\n   enhanced security and privacy to the users of the Internet.\n"
