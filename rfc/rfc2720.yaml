    \ in\n   controlling an RTFM Traffic Meter, in particular for specifying the\n\
    \   flows to be measured.  It also provides an efficient mechanism for\n   retrieving\
    \ flow data from the meter using SNMP. Security issues\n   concerning the operation\
    \ of traffic meters are summarised.\n"

  - "1  Introduction\n   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information\
    \ Base (MIB)\n   for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.\n\
    \   In particular, it describes objects for managing and collecting data\n   from\
    \ network Realtime Traffic Flow Meters, as described in [RTFM-\n   ARC].\n   The\
    \ MIB is 'basic' in the sense that it provides more than enough\n   information\
    \ for everyday traffic measurment.  Furthermore, it can be\n   easily extended\
    \ by adding new attributes as required.  The RTFM\n   Working group is actively\
    \ pursuing the development of the meter in\n   this way.\n"
- title: 2  The SNMP Management Framework
  contents:
  - "2  The SNMP Management Framework\n   The SNMP Management Framework presently\
    \ consists of five major\n   components:\n   - An overall architecture, described\
    \ in RFC 2571 [RFC2571].\n   - Mechanisms for describing and naming objects and\
    \ events for the\n     purpose of management.  The first version of this Structure\
    \ of\n     Management Information (SMI) is called SMIv1 and described in STD\n\
    \     16, RFC 1155 [RFC1155], STD 16, RFC 1212 [RFC1212] and RFC 1215\n     [RFC1215].\
    \  The second version, called SMIv2, is described in STD\n     58, RFC 2578 [RFC2578],\
    \ RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and RFC 2580 [RFC2580].\n   - Message protocols for transferring\
    \ management information.  The\n     first version of the SNMP message protocol\
    \ is called SNMPv1 and\n     described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [RFC1157].  A second\
    \ version of the\n     SNMP message protocol, which is not an Internet standards\
    \ track\n     protocol, is called SNMPv2c and described in RFC 1901 [RFC1901]\
    \ and\n     RFC 1906 [RFC1906].  The third version of the message protocol is\n\
    \     called SNMPv3 and described in RFC 1906 [RFC1906], RFC 2572\n     [RFC2572]\
    \ and RFC 2574 [RFC2574].\n   - Protocol operations for accessing management information.\
    \  The\n     first set of protocol operations and associated PDU formats is\n\
    \     described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [RFC1157].  A second set of protocol\n   \
    \  operations and associated PDU formats is described in RFC 1905\n     [RFC1905].\n\
    \   - A set of fundamental applications described in RFC 2573 [RFC2573]\n    \
    \ and the view-based access control mechanism described in RFC 2575\n     [RFC2575].\n\
    \   A more detailed introduction to the current SNMP Management Framework\n  \
    \ can be found in [RFC2570].\n   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information\
    \ store, termed\n   the Management Information Base or MIB. Objects in the MIB\
    \ are\n   defined using the mechanisms defined in the SMI.\n   This memo specifies\
    \ a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2.  A\n   MIB conforming to the SMIv1\
    \ can be produced through the appropriate\n   translations.  The resulting translated\
    \ MIB must be semantically\n   equivalent, except where objects or events are\
    \ omitted because no\n   translation is possible (use of Counter64).  Some machine\
    \ readable\n   information in SMIv2 will be converted into textual descriptions\
    \ in\n   SMIv1 during the translation process.  However, this loss of machine\n\
    \   readable information is not considered to change the semantics of the\n  \
    \ MIB.\n"
- title: 3  Overview
  contents:
  - "3  Overview\n   Traffic Flow Measurement seeks to provide a well-defined method\
    \ for\n   gathering traffic flow information from networks and internetworks.\n\
    \   The background for this is given in \"Internet Accounting Background\"\n \
    \  [ACT-BKG]. The Realtime Traffic Flow Measurement (rtfm) Working Group\n   has\
    \ produced a measurement architecture to achieve this goal; this is\n   documented\
    \ in \"Traffic Flow Measurement:  Architecture\" [RTFM-ARC].\n   The architecture\
    \ defines three entities:\n   - METERS, which observe network traffic flows and\
    \ build up a table of\n     flow data records for them,\n   - METER READERS, which\
    \ collect traffic flow data from meters, and\n   - MANAGERS, which oversee the\
    \ operation of meters and meter readers.\n   This memo defines the SNMP management\
    \ information for a Traffic Flow\n   Meter (TFM). Work in this field was begun\
    \ by the Internet Accounting\n   Working Group.  It has been further developed\
    \ and expanded by the\n   Realtime Traffic Flow Measurement Working Group.\n"
- title: 3.1  Scope of Definitions, Textual Conventions
  contents:
  - "3.1  Scope of Definitions, Textual Conventions\n   All objects defined in this\
    \ memo are registered in a single subtree\n   within the mib-2 namespace [MIB-II,\
    \ RFC2578], and are for use in\n   network devices which may perform a PDU forwarding\
    \ or monitoring\n   function.  For these devices, this MIB defines a group of\
    \ objects\n   with an SMI Network Management MGMT Code [ASG-NBR] of 40, i.e.\n\
    \   flowMIB OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::=  mib-2 40\n   as defined below.\n   The RTFM\
    \ Meter MIB was first produced and tested using SNMPv1.  It\n   was converted\
    \ into SNMPv2 following the guidelines in [RFC1908].\n"
- title: 3.2  Usage of the MIB variables
  contents:
  - "3.2  Usage of the MIB variables\n   The MIB is organised in four parts - control,\
    \ data, rules and\n   conformance statements.\n   The rules implement the set\
    \ of packet-matching actions, as described\n   in the \"Traffic Flow Measurment:\
    \  Architecture\" document [RTFM-ARC].\n   In addition they provide for BASIC-style\
    \ subroutines, allowing a\n   network manager to dramatically reduce the number\
    \ of rules required\n   to monitor a large network.\n   Traffic flows are identified\
    \ by a set of attributes for each of their\n   end-points.  Attributes include\
    \ network addresses for each layer of\n   the network protocol stack, and 'subscriber\
    \ ids', which may be used\n   to identify an accountable entity for the flow.\n\
    \   The conformance statements are set out as defined in [RFC2580].  They\n  \
    \ explain what must be implemented in a meter which claims to conform\n   to this\
    \ MIB.\n   To retrieve flow data one could simply do a linear scan of the flow\n\
    \   table.  This would certainly work, but would require a lot of\n   protocol\
    \ exchanges.  To reduce the overhead in retrieving flow data\n   the flow table\
    \ uses a TimeFilter variable, defined as a Textual\n   Convention in the RMON2\
    \ MIB [RMON2-MIB].\n   As an alternative method of reading flow data, the MIB\
    \ provides a\n   view of the flow table called the flowDataPackageTable.  This\
    \ is\n   (logically) a four-dimensional array, subscripted by package\n   selector,\
    \ RuleSet, activity time and starting flow number.  The\n   package selector is\
    \ a sequence of bytes which specifies a list of\n   flow attributes.\n   A data\
    \ package (as returned by the meter) is a sequence of values for\n   the attributes\
    \ specified in its selector, encoded using the Basic\n   Encoding Rules [ASN-BER].\
    \ It allows a meter reader to retrieve all\n   the attribute values it requires\
    \ in a single MIB object.  This, when\n   used together with SNMPv2's GetBulk\
    \ request, allows a meter reader to\n   scan the flow table and upload a specified\
    \ set of attribute values\n   for flows which have changed since the last reading,\
    \ and which were\n   created by a specified rule set.\n   One aspect of data collection\
    \ which needs emphasis is that all the\n   MIB variables are set up to allow multiple\
    \ independent meter readers\n   to work properly, i.e. the flow table indexes\
    \ are stateless.  An\n   alternative approach would have been to 'snapshot' the\
    \ flow table,\n   which would mean that the meter readers would have to be\n \
    \  synchronized.  The stateless approach does mean that two meter\n   readers\
    \ will never return exactly the same set of traffic counts, but\n   over long\
    \ periods (e.g. 15-minute collections over a day) the\n   discrepancies are acceptable.\
    \  If one really needs a snapshot, this\n   can be achieved by switching to an\
    \ identical rule set with a\n   different RuleSet number, hence asynchronous collections\
    \ may be\n   regarded as a useful generalisation of synchronised ones.\n   The\
    \ control variables are the minimum set required for a meter\n   reader.  Their\
    \ number has been whittled down as experience has been\n   gained with the MIB\
    \ implementation.  A few of them are 'general',\n   i.e. they control the overall\
    \ behaviour of the meter.  These are set\n   by a single 'master' manager, and\
    \ no other manager should attempt to\n   change their values.  The decision as\
    \ to which manager is the '\n   master' must be made by the network operations\
    \ personnel responsible;\n   this MIB does not attempt to define any interaction\
    \ between managers.\n   There are three other groups of control variables, arranged\
    \ into\n   tables in the same way as in the RMON2 MIB [RMON2-MIB]. They are used\n\
    \   as follows:\n   - RULE SET INFO: Before attempting to download a RuleSet,\
    \ a manager\n     must create a row in the flowRuleSetInfoTable and set its\n\
    \     flowRuleInfoSize to a value large enough to hold the RuleSet.  When\n  \
    \   the rule set is ready the manager must set flowRuleInfoRulesReady\n     to\
    \ 'true', indicating that the rule set is ready for use (but not\n     yet 'running').\n\
    \   - METER READER INFO: Any meter reader wishing to collect data\n     reliably\
    \ for all flows from a RuleSet should first create a row in\n     the flowReaderInfoTable\
    \ with flowReaderRuleSet set to that\n     RuleSet's index in the flowRuleSetInfoTable.\
    \  It should write that\n     row's flowReaderLastTime object each time it starts\
    \ a collection\n     pass through the flow table.  The meter will not recover\
    \ a flow's\n     memory until every meter reader holding a row for that flow's\n\
    \     RuleSet has collected the flow's data.\n   - MANAGER INFO: Any manager wishing\
    \ to run a RuleSet in the meter\n     must create a row in the flowManagerInfo\
    \ table, specifying the\n     desired RuleSet to run and its corresponding 'standby'\
    \ RuleSet (if\n     one is desired).  A current RuleSet is 'running' if its\n\
    \     flowManagerRunningStandby value is false(2), similarly a standby\n     RuleSet\
    \ is 'running' if flowManagerRunningStandby is true(1).\n   Times within the meter\
    \ are in terms of its Uptime, i.e. centiseconds\n   since the meter started. \
    \ For meters implemented as self-contained\n   SNMP agents this will be the same\
    \ as sysUptime, but this may not be\n   true for meters implemented as subagents.\
    \  Managers can read the\n   meter's Uptime when neccessary (e.g. to set a TimeFilter\
    \ value) by\n   setting flowReaderLastTime, then reading its new value.\n"

    \  \"An array of information about the RuleSets held in the\n        meter.\n\
    \        Any manager may configure a new RuleSet for the meter by\n        creating\
    \ a row in this table with status active(1), and setting\n        values for all\
    \ the objects in its rules.  At this stage the new\n        RuleSet is available\
    \ but not 'running', i.e. it is not being\n        used by the meter to produce\
    \ entries in the flow table.\n        To actually 'run' a RuleSet a manager must\
    \ create a row in\n        the flowManagerInfoTable, set it's flowManagerStatus\
    \ to\n        active(1), and set either its CurrentRuleSet or StandbyRuleSet\n\
    \        to point to the RuleSet to be run.\n        Once a RuleSet is running\
    \ a manager may not change any of the\n        objects within the RuleSet itself.\
    \  Any attempt to do so should\n        result in a notWritable(17) SNMP error-status\
    \ for such objects.\n        A manager may stop a RuleSet running by removing\
    \ all\n        references to it in the flowManagerInfoTable (i.e. by setting\n\
    \        CurrentRuleSet and StandbyRuleSet values to 0).  This provides\n    \
    \    a way to stop RuleSets left running if a manager fails.\n        For example,\
    \ when a manager is started, it could search the\n        meter's flowManager\
    \ table and stop all RuleSets having a\n        specified value of flowRuleInfoOwner.\n\
    \        To prevent a manager from interfering with variables belonging\n    \
    \    to another manager, the meter should use MIB views [RFC2575] so\n       \
    \ as to limit each manager's access to the meter's variables,\n        effectively\
    \ dividing the single meter into several virtual\n        meters, one for each\

    \ access to meter resources by Managers and\n   Meter Readers) and those in the\
    \ Flow Table (since they hold the\n   collected traffic flow data).\n   It is\
    \ thus important to control even GET access to these objects and\n   possibly\
    \ to even encrypt the values of these object when sending them\n   over the network\
    \ via SNMP. Not all versions of SNMP provide features\n   for such a secure environment.\n\
    \   SNMPv1 by itself is not a secure environment.  Even if the network\n   itself\
    \ is secure (for example by using IPSec), even then, there is no\n   control as\
    \ to who on the secure network is allowed to access and\n   GET/SET (read/change/create/delete)\
    \ the objects in this MIB.\n   It is recommended that the implementers consider\
    \ the security\n   features as provided by the SNMPv3 framework.  Specifically,\
    \ the use\n   of the User-based Security Model [RFC2574] and the View-based Access\n\
    \   Control Model [RFC2575] is recommended.\n   It is then a customer/user responsibility\
    \ to ensure that the SNMP\n   entity giving access to an instance of this MIB\
    \ is properly\n   configured to give access to the objects only to those principals\n\
    \   (users) that have legitimate rights to indeed GET or SET\n   (change/create/delete)\
    \ them.\n"
- title: 5.2  Traffic Meter Concerns
  contents:
  - "5.2  Traffic Meter Concerns\n   This MIB describes how an RTFM traffic meter\
    \ is controlled, and\n   provides a way for traffic flow data to be retrieved\
    \ from it by a\n   meter reader.  This is essentially an application using SNMP\
    \ as a\n   method of communication between co-operating hosts; it does not - in\n\
    \   itself - have any inherent security risks.\n   Since, however, the traffic\
    \ flow data can be extremely valuable for\n   network management purposes it is\
    \ vital that sensible precautions be\n   taken to keep the meter and its data\
    \ secure.  In particular, an\n   attacker must not be permitted to write any of\
    \ the meter's variables!\n   This requires that access to the meter for control\
    \ purposes (e.g.\n   loading RuleSets and reading flow data) be restricted.  Such\n\
    \   restriction could be achieved in many ways, for example:\n   - Physical Separation.\
    \  Meter(s) and meter reader(s) could be\n     deployed so that control capabilities\
    \ are kept within a separate\n     network, access to which is carefully controlled.\n\
    \   - Application-layer Security.  A minimal level of security for SNMP\n    \
    \ can be provided by using 'community' strings (which are essentially\n     clear-text\
    \ passwords) with SNMPv2C [RFC1157].  Where stronger\n     security is needed,\
    \ users should consider using the User-based\n     Security Model [RFC2574] and\
    \ the View-based Access Control Model\n     [RFC2575].\n   - Lower-layer Security.\
    \  Access to the meter can be protected using\n     encryption at the network\
    \ layer.  For example, one could run SNMP\n     to the meter through an encrypted\
    \ TCP tunnel.\n   When implementing a meter it may be sensible to use separate\
    \ network\n   interfaces for control and for metering.  If this is done the control\n\
    \   network can be set up so that it doesn't carry any 'user' traffic,\n   and\
    \ the metering interfaces can ignore any user attempts to take\n   control of\
    \ the meter.\n   Users should also consider how they will address attempts to\n\
    \   circumvent a meter, i.e. to prevent it from measuring flows.  Such\n   attempts\
    \ are essentially denial-of-service attacks on the metering\n   interfaces.  For\
    \ example\n   - Port Scan attacks.  The attacker sends packets to each of a very\n\
    \     large number of IP (Address :  Port) pairs.  Each of these packets\n   \
    \  creates a new flow in the meter; if there are enough of them the\n     meter\
    \ will recognise a 'flood' condition, and will probably stop\n     creating new\
    \ flows.  As a minimum, users (and implementors) should\n     ensure that meters\
    \ can recover from flood conditions as soon as\n     possible after they occur.\n\
    \   - Counter Wrap attacks:  The attacker sends enough packets to cause\n    \
    \ the counters in a flow to wrap several times between meter\n     readings, thus\
    \ causing the counts to be artificially low.  The\n     change to using 64-bit\
    \ counters in this MIB reduces this problem\n     significantly.\n   Users can\
    \ reduce the severity of both the above attacks by ensuring\n   that their meters\
    \ are read often enough to prevent them being\n   flooded.  The resulting flow\
    \ data will contain a record of the\n   attacking packets, which may well be useful\
    \ in determining where any\n   attack came from.\n"

  - "6  IANA Considerations\n   The RTFM Architecture document [RTFM-ARC], has two\
    \ sets of assigned\n   numbers:  Opcodes for the PME (Pattern Matching Engine)\

    \ MIB\n   appear in Textual Conventions.  The numbers they use are derived as\n\

- title: '7  Appendix A: Changes Introduced Since RFC 2064'
  contents:
  - "7  Appendix A: Changes Introduced Since RFC 2064\n   The first version of the\
    \ Meter MIB was published as RFC 2064 in\n   January 1997.  The most significant\
    \ changes since then are summarised\n   below.\n   - TEXTUAL CONVENTIONS: Greater\
    \ use is made of textual conventions to\n     describe the various types of addresses\
    \ used by the meter.\n   - PACKET MATCHING ATTRIBUTES: Computed attributes (e.g.\
    \ FlowClass and\n     FlowKind) may now be tested.  This allows one to use these\n\
    \     variables to store information during packet matching.\n     A new attribute,\
    \ MatchingStoD, has been added.  Its value is 1\n     while a packet is being\
    \ matched with its adresses in 'wire'\n     (source-to-destination) order.\n \
    \  - FLOOD MODE: This is now a read-write variable.  Setting it to\n     false(2)\
    \ switches the meter out of flood mode and back to normal\n     operation.\n \
    \  - CONTROL TABLES: Several variables have been added to the RuleSet,\n     Reader\
    \ and Manager tables to provide more effective control of the\n     meter's activities.\n\
    \   - FLOW TABLE: 64-bit counters are used for octet and PDU counts.\n     This\
    \ reduces the problems caused by the wrap-around of 32-bit\n     counters in earlier\
    \ versions.\n     flowDataRuleSet is now used as an index to the flow table. \
    \ This\n     allows a meter reader to collect only those flow table rows created\n\
    \     by a specified RuleSet.\n   - DATA PACKAGES: This is a new table, allowing\
    \ a meter reader to\n     retrieve values for a list of attributes from a flow\
    \ as a single\n     object (a BER-encoded sequence [ASN-1, ASN-BER]). It provides\
    \ an\n     efficient way to recover flow data, particularly when used with\n \
    \    SNMP GetBulk requests.\n     Earlier versions had a 'Column Activity Table';\
    \ using this it was\n     difficult to collect all data for a flow efficiently\
    \ in a single\n     SNMP request.\n"
