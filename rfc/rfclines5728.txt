Abstract This document describes the MIB module for the Digital Video Broadcasting Return Channel via Satellite system (DVB RCS), as defined by the SatLabs Group.
It defines a set of MIB objects to characterize the behavior and performance of network layer entities deploying DVB RCS.
The SatLabs Group [SATLABS] is an international non profit EEIG (European Economic Interest Grouping) committed to large scale adoption and deployment of the Digital Video Broadcasting Return Channel via Satellite (DVB RCS) standard [ETSI RCS].
SatLabs members are service providers, satellite operators, system integrators, terminal manufacturers, and technology providers with an interest in DVB RCS.
Since its creation in 2001, the main goal of the SatLabs Group has been to achieve interoperability between DVB RCS terminals and systems.
Therefore, the Group has defined the SatLabs Qualification Program, which provides an independent certification process for DVB  RCS terminals based on System Recommendations defined by SatLabs.
To enhance product interoperability, beyond the physical layer and MAC  layer mechanisms defined in the DVB RCS standard, SatLabs has expanded its Recommendations in the field of DVB RCS terminal management [SATLABS].
As part of this effort, SatLabs has specified a common Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) Management Information Base (MIB) for DVB RCS terminals, which is defined in this document.
A DVB RCS terminal is denoted as a Return Channel Satellite Terminal (RCST) in the remainder of this document.
This consists of an Indoor Unit (IDU) and an Outdoor Unit (ODU) connected through an Inter  Facility Link (IFL), usually a coaxial L band interface.
On the user side, the IDU is connected to the user network through a Local Area Network (LAN) interface (usually Ethernet).
On the network side, the ODU is connected via a satellite link (the air interface).
The SatLabs Group DVB RCS MIB is implemented in the IDU of an RCST.
RCST management can be performed either through the LAN interface (local management) or through the air interface (remote management from the Network Control Center, NCC).
RCST and NCC elements are shown on Figure 1.

This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB) for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current Internet Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of RFC 3410 [RFC3410].
Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed the Management Information Base or MIB.
MIB objects are generally accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the Structure of Management Information (SMI).
This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58, RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58

The terms in this document are derived either from DVB RCS standard specifications [ETSI RCS] or from SatLabs System Recommendations [SATLABS].
This denotes a hub and spoke configuration where all communications pass through a central hub, which usually also includes the NCC.
Peer to peer communication between RCSTs is possible through a double satellite hop (this traffic has to pass through the hub).
This denotes a mesh configuration that supports peer to peer communications in a single satellite hop directly between RCSTs.
This denotes a network using transparent satellite transponders.
Star or mesh network configurations can be supported.
In the case of a mesh configuration, RCSTs need to incorporate a TDMA receiver in addition to the TDM receiver.
This denotes a network that uses regenerative satellite transponders, i.e.  includes some On Board Processing functionality, which allows demodulation and decoding of the uplink TDMA signals and re multiplex of the traffic into TDM signals on the downlink.
Star or mesh network configurations can be supported.
The DVB RCS MAC layer represents the air interface of an RCST, as specified in [ETSI RCS].
The interface is bi directional and supports IP traffic over hub spoke (star) and mesh satellite network topologies.
The DVB RCS TDM corresponds to the forward link of a DVB RCS transparent system or the downlink of a DVB RCS regenerative system.
It is based on either the DVB S or DVB S2 standard, specified in [ETSI DVBS] and [ETSI DVBS2] respectively.
In the DVB RCS context, this interface is uni  or bi directional, as it may also be used for a return channel dedicated to a single terminal.
The DVB RCS TDMA corresponds to the return or mesh link of an RCS transparent system or the uplink of an RCS regenerative system.
It is specified in [ETSI RCS].
In the context of star transparent and mesh regenerative DVB RCS systems, this interface is uni directional.
In the context of mesh transparent DVB RCS systems, this interface is bi directional.
This is the indoor part of the RCST (including at least the power supply, and usually also the modem and networking functions).
This is the outdoor part of the RCST (including at least the aerial, and usually also the LNB and BUC).
This is the Satellite Terminal, installed on the customer premises.
It is composed of the IDU and ODU.
The NCC provides Control and Monitoring Functions.
It generates control and timing signals for the operation of the DVB RCS Network.
The configuration file is an XML formatted file, storing configuration parameters for the RCST and their values.
The log file is stored at the RCST.
This is used to log particular events that occur on the RCST side.
The installation log file is stored at the RCST.
This logs particular events that occur on the RCST side and are related to RCST installation phase.
This is the process to align the RCST antenna, part of the ODU, in order to enable bi directional communication (uplink, downlink) with the satellite network.
The CW frequency is the frequency of a Continuous Wave signal.
It is a narrowband carrier transmitted for the duration of measurements during the installation of an RCST.
Request Class A Request Class (RC) is a representation of a Per Hop Behavior (PHB) at the MAC layer.
It defines a behavior of the MAC layer for a given aggregation of traffic.
This behavior includes a combination of Capacity Categories associated to the RC and a priority with respect to the other RCs supported by an RCST.
Each Request Class is identified by a unique Channel ID in the communication between the RCST and the NCC.
The ATM profile is one of the two profiles for traffic burst format on a DVB RCS TDMA.
It is based on one or more concatenated ATM cells, each of length 53 bytes, plus an optional prefix.
The MPEG profile is one of the two profiles for traffic burst format on the DVB RCS TDMA.
It is based on a number of concatenated MPEG2 TS packets, each of length 188 bytes.
PID Pool For the MPEG profile, several RCs may be mapped within a pool of several PIDs to allow cross RC Section Packing [ETSI DAT].
Section Packing can be used on all PIDs and higher priority traffic can always preempt lower priority streams.
This reduces the need for padding.
The TDMA timeslot allocation process for the DVB RCS uplink supports several Capacity Categories.
The Capacity Categories CRA, RBDC, and A/VBDC, when authorized for an RC, have to be configured from the NCC.
Their configuration parameters are used to inform the RCST of the configuration of each category at the NCC side and thus help in Capacity Requests computation.
The categories are treated independently for each RC.
A SatLabs optional feature is defined that allows their configuration at the RCST level in addition to configuration per RC.
This feature is denoted RCST PARA.
Continuous Rate Assignment (CRA) CRA is a rate capacity that is provided in full in a continuous manner to the RCST while required.
Rate Based Dynamic Capacity (RBDC)
RBDC is a rate capacity that is requested dynamically by an RCST.
RBDC is provided in response to explicit requests from the RCST to the NCC, such requests being absolute (i.e., corresponding to the full rate currently being requested).
Each request overrides all previous RBDC requests from the same RCST and is subject to a maximum rate limit.
Volume Based Dynamic Capacity (VBDC) VBDC is a volume capacity that is requested dynamically by an RCST.
VBDC is provided in response to explicit requests from the RCST to the NCC, such requests being cumulative (i.e., each request adds to all previous requests from the same RCST).
AVBDC is a volume capacity that is requested dynamically by an RCST.
This capacity is provided in response to explicit requests from the RCST to the NCC, such requests being absolute (i.e., this request replaces the previous ones from the same RCST).
The combination of AVBDC and VBDC is seen as a single Capacity Category, denoted A/VBDC.
This defines a group of RCSTs within a network.
This is the satellite transponder on which the communication is initiated from an RCST point of view when in the installation mode.
The parameters corresponding to this transponder (satellite orbital position, frequency, etc.) are stored at the RCST as power up configuration data.
DVB S DVB S is the Digital Video Broadcast over Satellite [ETSI DVBS].
It is a framework and set of associated standards published by ETSI for the transmission of video, audio, and data, using the ISO MPEG 2 standard [ISO MPEG], over satellite links.
DVB S2 and CCM/VCM/ACM DVB S2 is the Second Generation of the Digital Video Broadcast for Satellite applications standard [ETSI DVBS2].
It is a framework and set of associated standards published by ETSI for the transmission of video, audio, and data.
The main framing unit of the DVB S2 protocol stack.
In CCM transmission mode, the forward link uses a constant set of transmission parameters (FEC coding rate and modulation scheme) for all receivers.
In VCM transmission mode, the forward link uses transmission parameters that are variable on a BBFRAME by BBFRAME but fixed on a Receiver basis, according to fixed link and propagation conditions for each Receiver.
In ACM transmission mode, the forward link uses transmission parameters that are dynamically adjusted on a BBFRAME by BBFRAME and Receiver per Receiver basis, according to actual link and propagation conditions.
In order to implement ACM, feedback from each Receiver has to be provided by DVB RCS return channel.
This is another name for a DVB RCS based satellite network.
This MIB module provides a set of objects required for the management of a SatLabs compliant RCST.
The specification is derived from the parameters and protocols described in [SATLABS].
Object Identifiers for the MIB
These values have been assigned for this MIB under the 'mib 2.transmission' subtree.
This MIB module defines new textual conventions for RCST indications of SatLabs defined capabilities, including profiles, options, and optional features.
DvbRcsSystemSatLabsProfileMap represents the SatLabs profiles supported as defined in [SATLABS].
DvbRcsSystemSatLabsOptionMap represents the SatLabs options supported as defined in [SATLABS].
These are options that are used for the certification of SatLabs terminals.
They represent important functionality, with impact on interoperability, and their support is advertised with the RCST certification level.
DvbRcsSystemSatLabsFeatureMap represents the SatLabs optional features supported as defined in [SATLABS].
These represent minor features, not necessary for interoperability.
They are not used for the certification of SatLabs terminals.
This MIB module is structured into two top level groups:
The dvbRcsMibObjects group includes all the managed objects of the DVB RCS MIB.
The dvbRcsConformance group includes the compliance statements for DVB RCS terminals that are compliant with [SATLABS].
The managed objects are grouped into formal object groups (i.e., units of conformance) according to their relation to specific SatLabs options or features.
The conformance statements (MODULE  COMPLIANCE specification) are described within the dvbRcsRcstCompliances group, while the units of conformance are described within the dvbRcsRcstGroups group.
The dvbRcsMibObjects group is further structured into three groups: dvbRcsRcst, dvbRcsFwdLink, and dvbRcsRtnLink.
The dvbRcsRcst group covers management related to the RCST equipment.
It is structured into six groups:  dvbRcsRcstSystem
The dvbRcsFwdLink group covers management information related to the RCST forward link.
It is structured into two groups:  dvbRcsFwdConfig
The dvbRcsRtnLink group covers management information related to the RCST return link.
It is structured into two groups:
dvbRcsRtnStatus Tables within each of these groups cover different functions like return link traffic management (packet classes, Request Classes, PID pools) and forward link configuration and status.
Rows created automatically (e.g., by the device according to the hardware configuration) may, and generally will, have a mixture of configuration and status objects within them.
Rows that are meant to be created by the management station are generally restricted to configuration (read create) objects.
Relationship to the Interfaces MIB Module
This section clarifies the relationship of this MIB module to the Interfaces MIB [RFC2863].
Several areas of correlation are addressed in the following.
The implementer is referred to the Interfaces MIB document in order to understand the general intent of these areas.
IANA has assigned three ifType labels for DVB RCS.
DVB RCS MAC Layer represents the complete air interface of an RCST, as specified in [ETSI RCS].
This interface supports star and mesh networks and is bi directional.
Only star networks are considered by the present MIB module.
It corresponds to the forward link of an RCS transparent system or the downlink of an RCS regenerative system.
It is based on either the DVB S or DVB S2 standard, specified in [ETSI DVBS] and [ETSI DVBS2] respectively.
Only transparent systems are considered by the present MIB module.
In the DVB RCS context, this interface is uni  or bi directional.
In the present MIB module, only a uni directional (i.e., forward link, or downstream) dvbTdm interface is considered.
It corresponds to the return or mesh link of an RCS transparent system or the uplink of an RCS regenerative system.
It is based on the DVB RCS standard specified in [ETSI RCS].
In the context of star transparent and mesh regenerative DVB RCS systems, this interface is uni directional.
In the context of mesh transparent DVB RCS systems, this interface is bi directional.
Only star transparent systems are considered by the present MIB module (i.e., return link, or upstream).
The protocol stack (as reflected in ifStackTable) will be as follows:
An additional Ethernet interface is used on the LAN side of the RCST (see Figure 1).
An instance of ifEntry exists for each dvbTdm interface, for each dvbRcsTdma (normally only one), and for each dvbRcsMac layer (normally only one).
The interface counters relate to:  dvbRcsMacLayer: DVB RCS
two way MAC interface that counts aggregate Multi Protocol Encapsulation (MPE) frames, Generic Stream Encapsulation (GSE) encapsulated PDUs (equals IP packets), and ATM Adaptation Layer 5 (AAL5) frames.
MPE is specified in [ETSI DAT] and is transported over MPEG, which is specified in [ISO MPEG].
MPEG is transported over GS or TS (Transport Stream) carriers.
The TS carrier is specified in [ETSI DVBS] for DVB S and [ETSI DVBS2] for DVB S2.
GSE is specified in [ETSI GSE] and is transported over the GS (Generic Stream) carrier, which is specified in [ETSI DVBS2].
ATM is specified in [ITU ATM].
AAL5 is specified in [ITU AAL5].
The DVB RCS TDM interface that counts MPEG TS packets at stream level, if the TS format is used.
If the Generic Stream (GS) format is used, it counts GSE packets.
: The DVB RCS TDMA interface that counts aggregate ATM and MPEG TS packets.
[RFC2863] MUST be implemented to identify the relationships among sub interfaces.
The following example is a DVB RCS star network with DVB S and DVB  RCS.
As illustrated on Figure 3, it shows a DVB RCS MAC interface with one downstream and one upstream interface.
In this network, ATM encapsulation is used in the DVB RCS uplink.
Two ATM Logical Ports are shown.
DVB S2 or DVB S can be used in the downlink.
ifType 214 'mpegTransport' can also be used for counting TS packets and bytes for sub interfaces of dvbRcsTdma or dvbTdm, e.g., per PID  oriented or per TS oriented, as desired and applicable.
Example Stacking As can be seen from this example, the dvbRcsMacLayer interface is layered on top of the downstream and upstream interfaces, and the upstream interface is layered on top of upstream ATM logical links.
In this example, the assignment of index values could be as follows:
The corresponding ifStack entries would then be:
The MIB objects in this group gather some basic information that would allow anyone to trace the history   the life   of the RCST, as well as to get a complete description of its constitution on the component point of view, including the SatLabs options/features support statement.
Many of the parameters will be defined at installation.
This group contains description parameters related to the RCST type (ODU type) and location.
These parameters are believed to stay unchanged once it has been defined during installation.
Modification of hardware equipment, maintenance operations, and geographical re  location may require an update of those MIB objects.
Note that the dvbRcsRcstSystem.dvbRcsSystemLocation object gives the location of the ODU antenna, which is needed for network operation, while the system.sysLocation (MIB II SNMP OID) provides the location of the IDU unit, which cannot be used for the same purpose.
The RCST must provide either Read Write access to dvbRcsSystemOdu parameters or, alternatively, provide the list of supported devices through the dvbRcsRcstOduListGroup (see conformance section).
This group of parameters, defined in the dvbRcsRcstSystem group, allows the selection by the RCST installer of the actual ODU type.
In such a case, the installer must set dvbRcsOduTxType, dvbRcsOduRxType, and dvbRcsOduAntennaType according to the selected BUC, LNB, and antenna respectively.
This group contains all the MIB objects related to network parameters.
In this subgroup, two objects have been defined in order to differentiate between control and user traffic and associate them with a physical interface.
Both dvbRcsRcstNetwork.dvbRcsNetworkLanIpAddress (Traffic) and dvbRcsRcstNetwork.dvbRcsNetworkOamInetAddress (OAM)
provide the value of the IP address of, respectively, the user traffic and the control and management traffic.
This group contains all the information related to the RCST installation and commissioning.
Many parameters are believed to stay unchanged once it has been defined during installation.
Modification of hardware equipment, maintenance operations, and geographical re  location may require an update of those MIB objects.
This group contains objects to configure the Quality of Service (QoS) of the RCST by the NCC.
The dvbRcsPktClass table defines the packet classification for IP layer 3 classifications.
dvbRcsPktClass entry is mapped to a dvbRcsPhbEntry in the dvbRcsPhbMappingTable.
The dvbRcsPhbMappingTable makes the relation between a packet classification entry, a Per Hop Behavior (PHB) identifier, and a Request Class entry.
The dvbRcsRequestClassTable defines all the layer 2 DVB RCS QoS parameters.
This MIB group contains objects a network manager can use to invoke actions and tests supported by the RCST agent and to retrieve the action/test results.
This MIB group describes the fault state, software versions, and configuration file versions of the RCST.
dvbRcsFwdLink (dvbRcsFwdConfig and dvbRcsFwdStatus groups)
This MIB group contains parameters that enable access to data about the forward link.
Configuration information is kept in the dvbRcsFwdLink.dvbRcsFwdConfig subgroup.
Status information is kept into the dvbRcsFwdLink.dvbRcsFwdStatus subgroup.
The information in dvbRcsFwdLink.dvbRcsFwdConfig.dvbRcsFwdStartTable is used for the first time the RCST tries to acquire the forward link.
All these object values are aligned with the Satellite Delivery System Descriptor in the Network Information Table (NIT) table [ETSI SI].
The objects in the dvbRcsFwdLink.dvbRcsFwdConfig.dvbRcsFwdStatusTable are aligned with the satellite forward path descriptor from the RCS Map Table (RMT)
[ETSI RCS] and with the Physical Layer (PL)
Header [ETSI DVBS2], which specifies the MODCOD (modulation and FEC rate) and the Type (frame length short or long and the presence/absence of pilots).
dvbRcsRtnLink (dvbRcsRtnConfig and dvbRcsRtnStatus groups)
This MIB group contains parameters that enable access to data about the return link.
Configuration information is kept in the dvbRcsRtnLink.dvbRcsRtnConfig subgroup.
Status information is kept into the dvbRcsRtnLink.dvbRcsRtnStatus subgroup.
The RCST is only able to deal with one return link at a time.
Hence, there is no need to define a table to collect the different SNMP objects, as it is done for the forward.

This MIB module relates to a system that allows end users to access a private network or public Internet access.
As such, improper manipulation of the MIB objects represented by this MIB module may result in denial of service to a large number of end users.
There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB module with a MAX ACCESS clause of read write and/or read  create.
Such objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.
The support for SET operations in a non secure environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on network operations.
These are the tables and objects and their sensitivity/vulnerability:
The use of the dvbRcsNetworkNccMgtInetAddress object to specify management stations is considered only limited protection and does not protect against attacks that spoof the management station's IP address.
The use of stronger mechanisms, such as SNMPv3 security, should be considered, where possible.
The dvbRcsSystemOdu objects, dvbRcsCtrlCwEnable, dvbRcsRtnConfigMaxEirp, dvbRcsRtnConfigDefIfLevel objects, and dvbRcsRcstInstall sub tree can, if improperly or maliciously used, lead to unwanted emissions or emission levels on the satellite uplink, thereby resulting in potential degradation of the RCS service or other services using the frequency band being used.
The RCST may have its configuration file changed by the actions of the management system using a combination of the following objects: dvbRcsNetworkInstallLogFileDownloadUrl, dvbRcsCtrlDownloadFileCommand, dvbRcsCtrlActivateConfigFileCommand, or dvbRcsCtrlRebootCommand.
An improper configuration file download may result in substantial vulnerabilities and the loss of the ability of the management system to control the satellite terminal.
Setting dvbRcsNetworkLogFileUploadUrl to a wrong address may potentially impact debugging/troubleshooting efforts.
Setting objects in dvbRcsPktClassTable could cause significant changes to default traffic filtering on an RCST.
Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a MAX ACCESS other than not accessible) may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.
It is thus important to control
even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over the network via SNMP.
These are the tables and objects and their sensitivity/vulnerability:
The dvbRcsNetworkNccMgtInetAddress object may provide sufficient information for attackers to spoof management stations that have management access to the device.
The dvbRcsRcstCurrentSoftwareVersion object may provide hints as to the software vulnerabilities of the RCST.
The object dvbRcsNetworkOamInetAddress and the table dvbRcsPktClassTable may provide clues for attacking the RCST and other subscriber devices.
SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPsec), even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is allowed to access and
the objects in this MIB module.
It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8), including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for authentication and privacy).
Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT RECOMMENDED.
Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to enable cryptographic security.
It is then a customer/operator responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an instance of this MIB module, is properly configured to give access to the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate rights to indeed GET or SET
The transmission and ifType numbers described in Section 3 have already been assigned under the smi numbers registry.
