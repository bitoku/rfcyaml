  - "1.  Introduction\n   The DNS [6][7] NSEC [5] Resource Record (RR) is used for\n\
    \   authenticated proof of the non-existence of DNS owner names and\n   types.\
    \  The NSEC RR is based on the NXT RR as described in RFC 2535\n   [2], and is\
    \ similar except for the name and typecode.  The RDATA\n   format for the NXT\
    \ RR has the limitation in that the RDATA could only\n   carry information about\
    \ the existence of the first 127 types.  RFC\n   2535 did reserve a bit to specify\
    \ an extension mechanism, but the\n   mechanism was never actually defined.\n\
    \   In order to avoid needing to develop an extension mechanism into a\n   deployed\
    \ base of DNSSEC aware servers and resolvers once the first\n   127 type codes\
    \ are allocated, this document redefines the wire format\n   of the \"Type Bit\
    \ Map\" field in the NSEC RDATA to cover the full RR\n   type space.\n   This\
    \ document introduces a new format for the type bit map.  The\n   properties of\
    \ the type bit map format are that it can cover the full\n   possible range of\
    \ typecodes, that it is relatively economical in the\n   amount of space it uses\
    \ for the common case of a few types with an\n   owner name, that it can represent\
    \ owner names with all possible types\n   present in packets of approximately\
    \ 8.5 kilobytes, and that the\n   representation is simple to implement.  Efficient\
    \ searching of the\n   type bitmap for the presence of certain types is not a\
    \ requirement.\n   For convenience and completeness, this document presents the\
    \ syntax\n   and semantics for the NSEC RR based on the specification in RFC 2535\n\
    \   [2] and as updated by RFC 3755 [5], thereby not introducing changes\n   except\
    \ for the syntax of the type bit map.\n   This document updates RFC 2535 [2] and\
    \ RFC 3755 [5].\n   The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\"\
    , \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and\
    \ \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n   document are to be interpreted as described in BCP\
    \ 14, RFC 2119 [1].\n"
- title: 2.  The NSEC Resource Record
  contents:
  - "2.  The NSEC Resource Record\n   The NSEC resource record lists two separate\
    \ things: the owner name of\n   the next RRset in the canonical ordering of the\
    \ zone, and the set of\n   RR types present at the NSEC RR's owner name.  The\
    \ complete set of\n   NSEC RRs in a zone indicate which RRsets exist in a zone,\
    \ and form a\n   chain of owner names in the zone.  This information is used to\n\
    \   provide authenticated denial of existence for DNS data, as described\n   in\
    \ RFC 2535 [2].\n   The type value for the NSEC RR is 47.\n   The NSEC RR RDATA\
    \ format is class independent and defined for all\n   classes.\n   The NSEC RR\
    \ SHOULD have the same TTL value as the SOA minimum TTL\n   field.  This is in\
    \ the spirit of negative caching [8].\n"

- title: 2.1.1.  The Next Domain Name Field
  contents:
  - "2.1.1.  The Next Domain Name Field\n   The Next Domain Name field contains the\
    \ owner name of the next RR in\n   the canonical ordering of the zone.  The value\
    \ of the Next Domain\n   Name field in the last NSEC record in the zone is the\
    \ name of the\n   zone apex (the owner name of the zone's SOA RR).\n   A sender\
    \ MUST NOT use DNS name compression on the Next Domain Name\n   field when transmitting\
    \ an NSEC RR.\n   Owner names of RRsets that are not authoritative for the given\
    \ zone\n   (such as glue records) MUST NOT be listed in the Next Domain Name\n\
    \   unless at least one authoritative RRset exists at the same owner\n   name.\n"
- title: 2.1.2.  The List of Type Bit Map(s) Field
  contents:
  - "2.1.2.  The List of Type Bit Map(s) Field\n   The RR type space is split into\
    \ 256 window blocks, each representing\n   the low-order 8 bits of the 16-bit\
    \ RR type space.  Each block that\n   has at least one active RR type is encoded\
    \ using a single octet\n   window number (from 0 to 255), a single octet bitmap\
    \ length (from 1\n   to 32) indicating the number of octets used for the window\
    \ block's\n   bitmap, and up to 32 octets (256 bits) of bitmap.\n   Window blocks\
    \ are present in the NSEC RR RDATA in increasing\n   numerical order.\n   \"|\"\
    \ denotes concatenation\n   Type Bit Map(s) Field = ( Window Block # | Bitmap\
    \ Length | Bitmap ) +\n   Each bitmap encodes the low-order 8 bits of RR types\
    \ within the\n   window block, in network bit order.  The first bit is bit 0.\
    \  For\n   window block 0, bit 1 corresponds to RR type 1 (A), bit 2 corresponds\n\
    \   to RR type 2 (NS), and so forth.  For window block 1, bit 1\n   corresponds\
    \ to RR type 257, and bit 2 to RR type 258.  If a bit is\n   set to 1, it indicates\
    \ that an RRset of that type is present for the\n   NSEC RR's owner name.  If\
    \ a bit is set to 0, it indicates that no\n   RRset of that type is present for\
    \ the NSEC RR's owner name.\n   Since bit 0 in window block 0 refers to the non-existing\
    \ RR type 0,\n   it MUST be set to 0.  After verification, the validator MUST\
    \ ignore\n   the value of bit 0 in window block 0.\n   Bits representing Meta-TYPEs\
    \ or QTYPEs, as specified in RFC 2929 [3]\n   (section 3.1), or within the range\
    \ reserved for assignment only to\n   QTYPEs and Meta-TYPEs MUST be set to 0,\
    \ since they do not appear in\n   zone data.  If encountered, they must be ignored\
    \ upon reading.\n   Blocks with no types present MUST NOT be included.  Trailing\
    \ zero\n   octets in the bitmap MUST be omitted.  The length of each block's\n\
    \   bitmap is determined by the type code with the largest numerical\n   value\
    \ within that block, among the set of RR types present at the\n   NSEC RR's owner\
    \ name.  Trailing zero octets not specified MUST be\n   interpreted as zero octets.\n"
- title: 2.1.3.  Inclusion of Wildcard Names in NSEC RDATA
  contents:
  - "2.1.3.  Inclusion of Wildcard Names in NSEC RDATA\n   If a wildcard owner name\
    \ appears in a zone, the wildcard label (\"*\")\n   is treated as a literal symbol\
    \ and is treated the same as any other\n   owner name for purposes of generating\
    \ NSEC RRs.  Wildcard owner names\n   appear in the Next Domain Name field without\
    \ any wildcard expansion.\n   RFC 2535 [2] describes the impact of wildcards on\
    \ authenticated\n   denial of existence.\n"
- title: 2.2.  The NSEC RR Presentation Format
  contents:
  - "2.2.  The NSEC RR Presentation Format\n   The presentation format of the RDATA\
    \ portion is as follows:\n   The Next Domain Name field is represented as a domain\
    \ name.\n   The List of Type Bit Map(s) Field is represented as a sequence of\
    \ RR\n   type mnemonics.  When the mnemonic is not known, the TYPE\n   representation\
    \ as described in RFC 3597 [4] (section 5) MUST be used.\n"
- title: 2.3.  NSEC RR Example
  contents:
  - "2.3.  NSEC RR Example\n   The following NSEC RR identifies the RRsets associated\
    \ with\n   alfa.example.com. and the next authoritative name after\n   alfa.example.com.\n\
    \   alfa.example.com. 86400 IN NSEC host.example.com. A MX RRSIG NSEC\n   TYPE1234\n\
    \   The first four text fields specify the name, TTL, Class, and RR type\n   (NSEC).\
    \  The entry host.example.com. is the next authoritative name\n   after alfa.example.com.\
    \ in canonical order.  The A, MX, RRSIG, NSEC,\n   and TYPE1234 mnemonics indicate\
