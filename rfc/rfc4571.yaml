  contents:
  - "1. Introduction\n   The Audio/Video Profile (AVP, [RFC3550]) for the Real-time\
    \ Transport\n   Protocol (RTP, [RFC3551]) does not define a method for framing\
    \ RTP\n   and RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) packets onto connection-oriented\n \
    \  transport protocols (such as TCP).  However, earlier versions of\n   RTP/AVP\
    \ did define a framing method, and this method is in use in\n   several implementations.\n\
    \   In this memo, we document the framing method that was defined by\n   earlier\
    \ versions of RTP/AVP.  In addition, we introduce a mechanism\n   for a session\
    \ description [SDP] to signal the use of the framing\n   method.  Note that session\
    \ description signalling for the framing\n   method is new and was not defined\
    \ in earlier versions of RTP/AVP.\n"

    \        Figure 1: The bit field definition of the framing method\n   A 16-bit\
    \ unsigned integer LENGTH field, coded in network byte order\n   (big-endian),\
    \ begins the frame.  If LENGTH is non-zero, an RTP or\n   RTCP packet follows\
    \ the LENGTH field.  The value coded in the LENGTH\n   field MUST equal the number\
    \ of octets in the RTP or RTCP packet.\n   Zero is a valid value for LENGTH, and\
    \ it codes the null packet.\n   This framing method does not use frame markers\
    \ (i.e., an octet of\n   constant value that would precede the LENGTH field).\
    \  Frame markers\n   are useful for detecting errors in the LENGTH field.  In\
    \ lieu of a\n   frame marker, receivers SHOULD monitor the RTP and RTCP header\
    \ fields\n   whose values are predictable (for example, the RTP version number).\n\
    \   See Appendix A.1 of [RFC3550] for additional guidance.\n"
- title: 3.  Packet Stream Properties
  contents:
  - "3.  Packet Stream Properties\n   In most respects, the framing method does not\
    \ specify properties\n   above the level of a single packet.  In particular, Section\
    \ 2 does\n   not specify the following:\n   Bi-directional issues\n      Section\
    \ 2 defines a framing method for use in one direction on a\n      connection.\
    \  The relationship between framed packets flowing in a\n      defined direction\
    \ and in the reverse direction is not specified.\n   Packet loss and reordering\n\
    \      The reliable nature of a connection does not imply that a framed\n    \
    \  RTP stream has a contiguous sequence number ordering.  For\n      example,\
    \ if the connection is used to tunnel a UDP stream through\n      a network middlebox\
    \ that only passes TCP, the sequence numbers in\n      the framed stream reflect\
    \ any packet loss or reordering on the UDP\n      portion of the end-to-end flow.\n\
    \   Out-of-band semantics\n      Section 2 does not define the RTP or RTCP semantics\
    \ for closing a\n      TCP socket, or of any other \"out of band\" signal for\
    \ the\n      connection.\n   Memos that normatively include the framing method\
    \ MAY specify these\n   properties.  For example, Section 4 of this memo specifies\
    \ these\n   properties for RTP/AVP sessions specified in session descriptions.\n\
    \   In one respect, the framing protocol does indeed specify a property\n   above\
    \ the level of a single packet.  If a direction of a connection\n   carries RTP\
    \ packets, the streams carried in this direction MUST\n   support the use of multiple\
    \ synchronization sources (SSRCs) in those\n   RTP packets.  If a direction of\
    \ a connection carries RTCP packets,\n   the streams carried in this direction\
    \ MUST support the use of\n   multiple SSRCs in those RTCP packets.\n"
- title: 4.  Session Descriptions for RTP/AVP over TCP
  contents:
  - "4.  Session Descriptions for RTP/AVP over TCP\n   Session management protocols\
    \ that use the Session Description\n   Protocol [SDP] in conjunction with the\
    \ Offer/Answer Protocol\n   [RFC3264] MUST use the methods described in [COMEDIA]\
    \ to set up\n   RTP/AVP streams over TCP.  In this case, the use of Offer/Answer\
    \ is\n   REQUIRED, as the setup methods described in [COMEDIA] rely on\n   Offer/Answer.\n\
    \   In principle, [COMEDIA] is capable of setting up RTP sessions for any\n  \
    \ RTP profile.  In practice, each profile has unique issues that must\n   be considered\
    \ when applying [COMEDIA] to set up streams for the\n   profile.\n   In this memo,\
    \ we restrict our focus to the Audio/Video Profile (AVP,\n   [RFC3551]).  Below,\
    \ we define a token value (\"TCP/RTP/AVP\") that\n   signals the use of RTP/AVP\
    \ in a TCP session.  We also define the\n   operational procedures that a TCP/RTP/AVP\
    \ stream MUST follow.\n   We expect that other standards-track memos will appear\
    \ to support the\n   use of the framing method with other RTP profiles.  The support\
    \ memo\n   for a new profile MUST define a token value for the profile, using\n\
    \   the style we used for AVP.  Thus, for profile xyz, the token value\n   MUST\
    \ be \"TCP/RTP/xyz\".  The memo SHOULD adopt the operational\n   procedures we\
    \ define below for AVP, unless these procedures are in\n   some way incompatible\
    \ with the profile.\n   The remainder of this section describes how to setup and\
    \ use an AVP\n   stream in a TCP session.  Figure 2 shows the syntax of a media\
    \ (m=)\n   line [SDP] of a session description:\n      \"m=\" media SP port [\"\
    /\" integer] SP proto 1*(SP fmt) CRLF\n       Figure 2: Syntax for an SDP media\
    \ (m=) line (from [SDP])\n   The <proto> token value \"TCP/RTP/AVP\" specifies\
    \ an RTP/AVP [RFC3550]\n   [RFC3551] stream that uses the framing method over\
    \ TCP.\n   The <fmt> tokens that follow <proto> MUST be unique unsigned integers\n\
    \   in the range 0 to 127.  The <fmt> tokens specify an RTP payload type\n   associated\
    \ with the stream.\n   In all other respects, the session description syntax for\
    \ the framing\n   method is identical to [COMEDIA].\n   The TCP <port> on the\
    \ media line carries RTP packets.  If a media\n   stream uses RTCP, a second connection\
    \ carries RTCP packets.  The port\n   for the RTCP connection is chosen using\
    \ the algorithms defined in\n   [SDP] or by the mechanism defined in [RFC3605].\n\
    \   The TCP connections MAY carry bi-directional traffic, following the\n   semantics\
    \ defined in [COMEDIA].  Both directions of a connection MUST\n   carry the same\
    \ type of packets (RTP or RTCP).  The packets MUST\n   exclusively code the RTP\
    \ or RTCP streams specified on the media\n   line(s) associated with the connection.\n\
    \   As noted in [RFC3550], the use of RTP without RTCP is strongly\n   discouraged.\
    \  However, if a sender does not wish to send RTCP packets\n   in a media session,\
    \ the sender MUST add the lines \"b=RS:0\" AND\n   \"b=RR:0\" to the media description\
    \ (from [RFC3556]).\n   If the session descriptions of the offer AND the answer\
    \ both contain\n   the \"b=RS:0\" AND \"b=RR:0\" lines, an RTCP TCP flow for the\
    \ media\n   session MUST NOT be created by either endpoint in the session.  In\n\
    \   all other cases, endpoints MUST establish two TCP connections for an\n   RTP/AVP\
    \ stream, one for RTP and one for RTCP.\n   As described in [RFC3264], the use\
    \ of the \"sendonly\" or \"sendrecv\"\n   attribute in an offer (or answer) indicates\
    \ that the offerer (or\n   answerer) intends to send RTP packets on the RTP TCP\
    \ connection.  The\n   use of the \"recvonly\" or \"sendrecv\" attributes in an\
    \ offer (or\n   answer) indicates that the offerer (or answerer) wishes to receive\n\
    \   RTP packets on the RTP TCP connection.\n"

    \ Figure 4: TCP session description for the second participant\n   The session\
    \ descriptions define two parties that participate in a\n   connection-oriented\
    \ RTP/AVP session.  The first party (Figure 3) is\n   capable of receiving stereo\
    \ L16 streams (static payload type 11).\n   The second party (Figure 4) is capable\
    \ of receiving mono (static\n   payload type 10) or stereo L16 streams.\n   The\
    \ \"setup\" attribute in Figure 3 specifies that the first party is\n   \"active\"\
    \ and initiates connections, and the \"setup\" attribute in\n   Figure 4 specifies\
    \ that the second party is \"passive\" and accepts\n   connections [COMEDIA].\n\
    \   The first party connects to the network address (192.0.2.94) and port\n  \
    \ (16112) of the second party.  Once the connection is established, it\n   is\
    \ used bi-directionally: the first party sends framed RTP packets to\n   the second\
    \ party in one direction of the connection, and the second\n   party sends framed\
    \ RTP packets to the first party in the other\n   direction of the connection.\n\
    \   The first party also initiates an RTCP TCP connection to port 16113\n   (16112\
    \ + 1, as defined in [SDP]) of the second party.  Once the\n   connection is established,\
    \ the first party sends framed RTCP packets\n   to the second party in one direction\
    \ of the connection, and the\n   second party sends framed RTCP packets to the\
    \ first party in the\n   other direction of the connection.\n"
- title: 6.  Congestion Control
  contents:
  - "6.  Congestion Control\n   The RTP congestion control requirements are defined\
    \ in [RFC3550].  As\n   noted in [RFC3550], all transport protocols used on the\
    \ Internet need\n   to address congestion control in some way, and RTP is not\
    \ an\n   exception.\n   In addition, the congestion control requirements for the\
    \ Audio/Video\n   Profile are defined in [RFC3551].  The basic congestion control\n\
    \   requirement defined in [RFC3551] is that RTP sessions should compete\n   fairly\
    \ with TCP flows that share the network.  As the framing method\n   uses TCP,\
    \ it competes fairly with other TCP flows by definition.\n"

  - "8.  Security Considerations\n   Implementors should carefully read the Security\
    \ Considerations\n   sections of the RTP [RFC3550] and RTP/AVP [RFC3551] documents,\
    \ as\n   most of the issues discussed in these sections directly apply to RTP\n\
    \   streams framed over TCP.\n   Session descriptions that specify connection-oriented\
    \ media sessions\n   (such as the example session shown in Figures 3 and 4 of\
    \ Section 5)\n   raise unique security concerns for streaming media.  The Security\n\
    \   Considerations section of [COMEDIA] describes these issues in detail.\n  \
    \ Below, we discuss security issues that are unique to the framing\n   method\
    \ defined in Section 2.\n   Attackers may send framed packets with large LENGTH\
    \ values to exploit\n   security holes in applications.  For example, a C implementation\
    \ may\n   declare a 1500-byte array as a stack variable, and use LENGTH as the\n\
    \   bound on the loop that reads the framed packet into the array.  This\n   code\
    \ would work fine for friendly applications that use Etherframe-\n   sized RTP\
    \ packets, but may be open to exploit by an attacker.  Thus,\n   an implementation\
    \ needs to handle packets of any length, from a NULL\n   packet (LENGTH == 0)\
    \ to the maximum-length packet holding 64K octets\n   (LENGTH = 0xFFFF).\n"
