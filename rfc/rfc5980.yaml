  - "1.  Introduction\n   Mobility of IP-based nodes incurs route changes, usually\
    \ at the edge\n   of the network.  Since IP addresses are usually part of flow\n\
    \   identifiers, the change of IP addresses implies the change of flow\n   identifiers\
    \ (i.e., the General Internet Signaling Transport (GIST)\n   message routing information\
    \ or Message Routing Information (MRI)\n   [RFC5971]).  Local mobility usually\
    \ does not cause the change of the\n   global IP addresses, but affects the routing\
    \ paths within the local\n   access network.\n   The NSIS protocol suite consists\
    \ of two layers: the NSIS Transport\n   Layer Protocol (NTLP) and the NSIS Signaling\
    \ Layer Protocol (NSLP).\n   The General Internet Signaling Transport (GIST) [RFC5971]\
    \ implements\n   the NTLP, which is a protocol that is independent of the signaling\n\
    \   application and that transports service-related information between\n   neighboring\
    \ GIST nodes.  Each specific service has its own NSLP\n   protocol; currently\
    \ there are two specified NSLP protocols, the QoS\n   NSLP [RFC5974] and the Network\
    \ Address Translator / Firewall (NAT/FW)\n   NSLP [RFC5973].\n   The goals of\
    \ this document are to present the effects of mobility on\n   the NTLP/NSLPs and\
    \ to provide guides on how such NSIS protocols work\n   in basic mobility scenarios,\
    \ including support for Mobile IPv4 and\n   Mobile IPv6 scenarios.  We also show\
    \ how these protocols fulfill the\n   requirements regarding mobility set forth\
    \ in [RFC3726].  In general,\n   the NSIS protocols work well in mobile environments.\
    \  The Session ID\n   (SID) used in NSIS signaling enables the separation of the\
    \ signaling\n   state and the IP addresses of the communicating hosts.  This makes\
    \ it\n   possible to directly update a signaling state in the network due to\n\
    \   mobility without being forced to first remove the old state and then\n   re-establish\
    \ a new one.  This is the fundamental reason why NSIS\n   signaling works well\
    \ in mobile environments.  Additional information\n   and mobility-specific enhanced\
    \ operations, e.g., operations with\n   crossover node (CRN), are also introduced.\n\
    \   This document focuses on basic mobility scenarios.  Key management\n   related\
    \ to handovers, multihoming, and interactions between NSIS and\n   other mobility\
    \ management protocols than Mobile IP are out of scope\n   of this document. \
    \ Also, practical implementations typically need\n   various APIs across components\
    \ within a node.  API issues, e.g., APIs\n   from GIST to the various mobility\
    \ and routing schemes, are also out\n   of scope of this work.  The generic GIST\
    \ API towards NSLP is flexible\n   enough to fulfill most mobility-related needs\
    \ of the NSLP layer.\n"
- title: 2.  Requirements Notation and Terminology
  contents:
  - "2.  Requirements Notation and Terminology\n   The terminology in this document\
    \ is based on [RFC5971] and [RFC3753].\n   In addition, the following terms are\
    \ used.  Note that in this\n   document, a generic route change caused by regular\
    \ IP routing is\n   referred to as a 'route change', and the route change caused\
    \ by\n   mobility is referred to as 'mobility'.\n   (1) Downstream\n   The direction\
    \ from a data sender towards the data receiver.\n   (2) Upstream\n   The direction\
    \ from a data receiver towards the data sender.\n   (3) Crossover Node (CRN)\n\
    \   A Crossover Node is a node that for a given function is a merging\n   point\
    \ of two or more paths belonging to flows of the same session\n   along which\
    \ states are installed.\n   In the mobility scenarios, there are two different\
    \ types of merging\n   points in the network according to the direction of signaling\
    \ flows\n   followed by data flows, where we assume that the Mobile Node (MN)\
    \ is\n   the data sender.\n      Upstream CRN (UCRN): the node closest to the\
    \ data sender from\n      which the state information in the direction from data\
    \ receiver to\n      data sender begins to diverge after a handover.\n      Downstream\
    \ CRN (DCRN): the node closest to the data sender from\n      which the state\
    \ information in the direction from the data sender\n      to the data receiver\
    \ begins to converge after a handover.\n   In general, the DCRN and the UCRN may\
    \ be different due to the\n   asymmetric characteristics of routing, although\
    \ the data receiver is\n   the same.\n   (4) State Update\n   State Update is\
    \ the procedure for the re-establishment of NSIS state\n   on the new path, the\
    \ teardown of NSIS state on the old path, and the\n   update of NSIS state on\
    \ the common path due to the mobility.  The\n   State Update procedure is used\
    \ to address mobility for the affected\n   flows.\n      Upstream State Update:\
    \ State Update for the upstream signaling\n      flow.\n      Downstream State\
    \ Update: State Update for the downstream signaling\n      flow.\n"
- title: 3.  Challenges with Mobility
  contents:
  - "3.  Challenges with Mobility\n   This section identifies problems that are caused\
    \ by mobility and\n   affect the operations of NSIS protocol suite.\n   1.  Change\
    \ of route and possible change of the MN's IP address\n   Topology changes or\
    \ network reconfiguration might lead to path\n   changes for data packets sent\
    \ to or from the MN and can cause an IP\n   address change of the MN.  Traditional\
    \ route changes usually do not\n   cause address changes of the flow endpoints.\
    \  When an IP address\n   changes due to mobility, information within the path-coupled\
    \ MRI is\n   affected (the source or destination address).  Consequently, this\n\
    \   concerns GIST as well as NSLPs, e.g., the packet classifier in QoS\n   NSLP\
    \ or some rules carried in NAT/FW NSLP.  So, firewall rules, NAT\n   bindings,\
    \ and QoS reservations that are already installed may become\n   invalid because\
    \ the installed states refer to a non-existent flow.\n   If the affected nodes\
    \ are also on the new path, this information must\n   be updated accordingly.\n\
    \   2.  Double state problem\n   After a handover, packets may end up getting\
    \ delivered through a new\n   path.  Since the state on the old path still remains\
    \ as it was after\n   re-establishing the state along the new path, we have two\
    \ separate\n   states for the same signaling session.  Although the state on the\
    \ old\n   path will be deleted automatically based on the soft state timeout,\n\
    \   the state timer value may be quite long (e.g., 90 s as a default\n   value).\
    \  With the QoS NSLP, this problem might result in the waste of\n   resources\
    \ and lead to failure of admitting new reservations (due to\n   lack of resources).\
    \  With the NAT/FW NSLP, it is still possible to\n   re-use this installed state\
    \ although an MN roams to a new location;\n   this means that another host can\
    \ send data through a firewall without\n   any prior NAT/FW NSLP signaling because\
    \ the previous state did not\n   yet expire.\n   3.  End-to-end signaling and\
    \ frequency of route changes\n   The change of route and IP addresses in mobile\
    \ environments is\n   typically much faster and more frequent than traditional\
    \ route\n   changes caused by node or link failure.  This may result in a need\
    \ to\n   speed up the update procedure of NSLP states.\n   4.  Identification\
    \ of the crossover node\n   When a handover at the edge of a network has happened,\
    \ in the typical\n   case, only some parts of the end-to-end path used by the\
    \ data packets\n   change.  In this situation, the crossover node (CRN) plays\
    \ a central\n   role in managing the establishment of the new signaling application\n\
    \   state, and removing any useless state, while localizing the signaling\n  \
    \ to only the affected part of the network.\n   5.  Upstream State Update vs.\
    \ Downstream State Update\n   Due to the asymmetric nature of Internet routing,\
    \ the upstream and\n   downstream paths are likely not to be exactly the same.\
    \  Therefore,\n   state update needs to be handled independently for upstream\
    \ and\n   downstream paths.\n   6.  Upstream signaling\n   If the MN is the receiver\
    \ and moves to a new point of attachment, it\n   is difficult to signal upstream\
    \ towards the Correspondent Node (CN).\n   New signaling states have to be established\
    \ along the new path, but\n   for a path-coupled Message Routing Method (MRM),\
    \ this has to be\n   initiated in downstream direction.  So, NTLP signaling state\
    \ in the\n   upstream direction cannot be initiated by the MN, i.e., GIST cannot\n\
    \   easily send a Query in the upstream direction (there is an upstream\n   Q-mode,\
    \ but this is only applicable in a limited scope).  The use of\n   additional\
    \ protocols such as application-level signaling (e.g,\n   Session Initiation Protocol\
    \ (SIP)) or mobility management signaling\n   (e.g., Mobile IP) may help to trigger\
    \ NSLP and NTLP signaling from\n   the CN side in the downstream direction though.\n\
    \   7.  Authorization issues\n   The procedure of State Update may be initiated\
    \ by the MN, the CN, or\n   even nodes within the network (e.g., crossover node,\
    \ Mobility Anchor\n   Point (MAP) in Hierarchical Mobile IP (HMIP)).  This State\
    \ Update on\n   behalf of the MN raises authorization issues about the entity\
    \ that is\n   allowed to make these state modifications.\n   8.  Dead peer and\
    \ invalid NSIS Receiver (NR) problem\n   When the MN is on the path of a signaling\
    \ exchange, after handover\n   the old Access Router (AR) cannot forward NSLP\
    \ messages towards the\n   MN.  In this case, the old AR's mobility or routing\
    \ protocol (or even\n   the NSLP) may trigger an error message to indicate that\
    \ the last node\n   fails or is truncated.  This error message is forwarded and\
    \ may\n   mistakenly cause the removal of the state on the existing common\n \
    \  path, if the state is not updated before the error message is\n   propagated\
    \ through the signaling peers.  This is called the 'invalid\n   NSIS Receiver\
    \ (NR) problem'.\n   9.  IP-in-IP encapsulation\n   Mobility protocols may use\
    \ IP-in-IP encapsulation on the segment of\n   the end-to-end path for routing\
    \ traffic from the CN to the MN, and\n   vice versa.  Encapsulation harms any\
    \ attempt to identify and filter\n   data traffic belonging to, for example, a\
    \ QoS reservation.  Moreover,\n   encapsulation of data traffic may lead to changes\
    \ in the routing\n   paths since the source and the destination IP addresses of\
    \ the inner\n   header differ from those of the outer header.  Mobile IP uses\n\
    \   tunneling mechanisms to forward data packets among end hosts.\n   Traversing\
    \ through the tunnel, NSIS signaling messages are\n   transparent on the tunneling\
    \ path due to the change of flow's\n   addresses.  In case of interworking with\
    \ Mobile IP tunneling, CRNs\n   can be discovered on the tunneling path.  It enables\
    \ NSIS protocols\n   to perform the State Update procedure over the IP tunnel.\
    \  In this\n   case, GIST needs to cope with the change of Message Routing\n \
    \  Information (MRI) for the CRN discovery on the tunnel.  Also, NSLP\n   signaling\
    \ needs to determine when to remove the tunneling segment on\n   the signaling\
    \ path and/or how to tear down the old state via\n   interworking with the IP\
    \ tunneling operation.  Furthermore, tunneling\n   adds additional IP header as\
    \ overhead that must be taken into account\n   by QoS NSLP, for example, when\
    \ resources must be reserved\n   accordingly.  So an NSLP must usually be aware\
    \ whether tunneling or\n   route optimization is actually used for a flow [RFC5979].\n"
- title: 4.  Basic Operations for Mobility Support
  contents:
  - "4.  Basic Operations for Mobility Support\n   This section presents the basic\
    \ operations of the NSIS protocol suite\n   after mobility-related route changes.\
    \  Details of the operation of\n   Mobile IP with respect to NSIS protocols are\
    \ discussed in the\n   subsequent section.\n"
- title: 4.1.  General Functionality
  contents:
  - "4.1.  General Functionality\n   The NSIS protocol suite decouples state and flow\
    \ identification.  A\n   state is stored and referred by the Session ID (SID).\
    \  Flows\n   associated with a given NSLP state are defined by the Message Routing\n\
    \   Information (MRI).  GIST notices when a routing path associated with\n   a\
    \ SID changes, and provides a notification to the NSLP.  It is then\n   up to\
    \ the NSLP to update the state information in the network.  Thus,\n   the effect\
    \ is an update to the states, not a full new request.  This\n   decoupling also\
    \ effectively solves a typical problem with certain\n   signaling protocols, where\
    \ protocol state is identified by flow\n   endpoints, and when flow endpoint addresses\
    \ change, the whole session\n   state becomes invalid.\n   A further benefit of\
    \ the decoupling is that if the MRI, i.e., the IP\n   addresses associated with\
    \ the data flow, remain the same after\n   movement, the NSIS signaling will repair\
    \ only the affected path of\n   the end-to-end session.  Thus, updating the session\
    \ information in\n   the network will be localized, and no end-to-end signaling\
    \ will be\n   needed.  If the MRI changes, end-to-end signaling usually cannot\
    \ be\n   avoided since new information for proper data flow identification\n \
    \  must be provided all the way between the data sender and receiver,\n   e.g.,\
    \ in order to update filters, QoS profiles, or other flow-related\n   session\
    \ data.\n   GIST provides NSLPs with an identifier of the next signaling peer,\n\
    \   the Source Identification Information (SII) handle.  When this SII-\n   Handle\
    \ changes, the NSLP knows a routing change has happened.  Yet,\n   the NSLP can\
    \ also figure out whether it is also the crossover node\n   for the session. \
    \ Thus, CRN discovery is always done at the NSLP\n   layer because only NSLPs\
    \ have a notion of end-to-end signaling.\n   When a path changes, the session\
    \ information on the old path needs to\n   be removed.  Normally, the information\
    \ is released when the session\n   timer is expired after a routing change.  But\
    \ the NSLP running on the\n   end-host or the CRN, depending on the direction\
    \ of the session, may\n   use the SII-Handle (provided by GIST) to explicitly\
    \ remove states on\n   the old path; new session information is simultaneously\
    \ set up on the\n   new path.  Both current NSLPs use sequence numbers to identify\
    \ the\n   order of messages, and this information can be used by the protocols\n\
    \   to recover from a routing change.\n   Since NSIS operates on a hop-by-hop\
    \ basis, any peer can perform state\n   updates.  This is possible because a chain\
    \ of trust is expected\n   between NSIS nodes.  If this weren't the case (e.g.,\
    \ true resource\n   reservations are not possible), one misbehaving or compromised\
    \ node\n   would effectively break everything.  Thus, currently the NSIS\n   protocols\
    \ do not limit the roles of each NSIS signaling peer on a\n   path, and any node\
    \ can make updates.  Yet, some updates are reflected\n   back to the signaling\
    \ endpoints, and they can decide whether or not\n   the signaling actually succeeded.\n\
    \   If the signaling packets are encapsulated in a tunnel, it is\n   necessary\
    \ to perform a separate signaling exchange for the tunneled\n   region.  Furthermore,\
    \ a binding is needed to tie the end-to-end and\n   tunneled session together.\n\
    \   In some cases, the NSLP must be aware whether tunneling is used,\n   since\
    \ additional tunneling overhead must be taken into account, e.g.,\n   for resource\
    \ reservations, etc.\n"
- title: 4.2.  QoS NSLP
  contents:
  - "4.2.  QoS NSLP\n   Figure 1 illustrates an example of QoS NSLP signaling in a\
    \ Mobile\n   IPv6 route optimization case, for a data flow from the MN to the\
    \ CN,\n   where sender-initiated reservation is used.  Once a handover event is\n\
    \   detected in the MN, the MN needs to acquire the new Care-of Address\n   (CoA)\
    \ and update the path coupled MRI accordingly.  Then, the MN\n   issues towards\
    \ the CN a QoS NSLP RESERVE message that carries the\n   unique session ID and\
    \ other identification information for the\n   session, as well as the reservation\
    \ requirements (steps (1)-(4) in\n   Figure 1).  Upon receipt of the RESERVE message,\
    \ the QoS NSLP nodes\n   (which will be discovered by the underlying NTLP) establish\
    \ the\n   corresponding QoS NSLP state, and forward the message towards the CN.\n\
    \   When there is already an existing NSLP state with the same session\n   ID,\
    \ the state will be updated.  If all the QoS NSLP nodes along the\n   path support\
    \ the required QoS, the CN in turn responds with a\n   RESPONSE message to confirm\
    \ the reservation (steps (5)-(6) in\n   Figure 1).\n   In a bidirectional tunneling\
    \ case, the only difference is that the\n   RESERVE message should be sent to\
    \ the home agent (HA) instead of the\n   CN, and the node that responds with a\
    \ RESPONSE should be the HA\n   instead of the CN, too.  More details are given\
    \ in Section 5.\n   Therefore, for the basic operation there is no fundamental\
    \ difference\n   among different operation modes of Mobile IP, and the main issue\
    \ of\n   mobility support in NSIS is to trigger NSLP signaling appropriately\n\
    \   when a handover event is detected.  Also, the destination of the NSLP\n  \
    \ signaling shall follow the Mobile IP data path using path-coupled\n   signaling.\n\
    \   In this process, the obsoleted state in the old path is not\n   explicitly\

    \ up the process, it may be possible to localize\n   the signaling.  When the\
    \ RESERVE message reaches a node, depicted as\n   CRN in this document (step (2)\
    \ in Figure 1), where a state is\n   determined for the first time to reflect\
    \ the same session, the node\n   may issue a NOTIFY message towards the MN's old\
    \ CoA (step (9) in\n   Figure 1).  The QoS NSIS Entity (QNE) adjacent to the MN's\
    \ old\n   position stops the NOTIFY message (step (10) in Figure 1) and sends\
    \ a\n   RESERVE message (with Teardown bit set) towards the CN to release the\n\
    \   obsoleted state (step (11) in Figure 1).  This RESERVE with tear\n   message\
    \ is stopped by the CRN (step (12) in Figure 1).  The\n   Reservation Sequence\
    \ Number (RSN) is used in the messages to\n   distinguish the order of the signaling.\

  - "4.3.  NATFW NSLP\n   Figure 2 illustrates an example of NATFW NSLP signaling\
    \ in a Mobile\n   IPv6 route optimization case, for a data flow from the MN to\
    \ the CN.\n   The difference to the QoS NSLP is that for the NATFW NSLP only the\n\
    \   NSIS initiator (NI) can update the signaling session, in any case.\n   Once\
    \ a handover event is detected in the MN, the MN must get to know\n   the new\
    \ Care-of Address and update the path coupled MRI accordingly.\n   Then the MN\
    \ issues a NATFW NSLP CREATE message towards the CN, that\n   carries the unique\
    \ session ID and other identification information\n   for the session (steps (1)-(4)\
    \ in Figure 2).  Upon receipt of the\n   CREATE message, the NATFW NSLP nodes\
    \ (which will be discovered by the\n   underlying NTLP) establish the corresponding\
    \ NATFW NSLP state, and\n   forward the message towards the CN.  When there is\
    \ already an\n   existing NSLP state with the same session ID, the state will\
    \ be\n   updated.  If all the NATFW NSLP nodes along the path accept the\n   required\
    \ NAT/firewall configuration, the CN in turn responds with a\n   RESPONSE message,\
    \ to confirm the configuration (steps (5)-(8) in\n   Figure 2).\n   In a bidirectional\
    \ tunneling case, the only difference is that the\n   CREATE message should be\
    \ sent to the HA instead of the CN, and the\n   node that responds with a RESPONSE\
    \ should be the HA instead of the CN\n   too.\n   Therefore, for the basic operation\
    \ there is no fundamental difference\n   among different operation modes of Mobile\
    \ IP, and the main issue of\n   mobility support in NSIS is to trigger NSLP signaling\
    \ appropriately\n   when a handover event is detected, and the destination of\
    \ the NSLP\n   signaling shall follow the Mobile IP data path as being path-coupled\n\
    \   signaling.\n   In this process, the obsoleted state in the old path is not\n\
    \   explicitly released because the state can be released by timer\n   expiration.\
    \  To speed up the process, when the CREATE message reaches\n   a node, depicted\
    \ as CRN in this document (step (2) in Figure 2),\n   where a state is determined\
    \ for the first time to reflect the same\n   session, the node may issue a NOTIFY\
    \ message towards the MN's old CoA\n   (steps (9)-(10) in Figure 2).  When the\
    \ NI notices this, it sends a\n   CREATE message towards the CN to release the\

    \  In addition, NSIS state needs to be established\n   along the new path and\

    \ oriented reservations, respectively.  Also, the QNE realizes it is\n   implicitly\
    \ the CRN.\n"
- title: 4.4.2.  Localized State Update
  contents:
  - "4.4.2.  Localized State Update\n   In the downstream State Update, the MN initiates\
    \ the RESERVE with a\n   new RSN for state setup toward a CN, and also the implicit\
    \ DCRN\n   discovery is performed by the procedure of signaling as described in\n\
    \   Section 4.4.1.  The MRI from the DCRN to the CN (i.e., common path)\n   is\
    \ updated by the RESERVE message.  The DCRN may also send a NOTIFY\n   with \"\
    Route Change\" (0x02) to the previous upstream peer.  The NOTIFY\n   is forwarded\
    \ hop-by-hop and reaches the edge QNE (i.e., QNE1 in\n   Figure 1).  After the\
    \ QNE is aware that the MN as QNI has disappeared\n   (how this can be noticed\
    \ is out of scope for NSIS, yet, e.g., GIST\n   will eventually know this through\
    \ undelivered messages), the QNE\n   sends a tearing RESERVE towards downstream.\
    \  When the tearing RESERVE\n   reaches the DCRN, it stops forwarding and drops\
    \ it.  Note that,\n   however, it is not necessary for GIST state to be explicitly\
    \ removed\n   because of the inexpensiveness of the state maintenance at the GIST\n\
    \   layer [RFC5971].  Note that the sender-initiated approach leads to\n   faster\
    \ setup than the receiver-initiated approach as in RSVP\n   [RFC2205].\n   In\
    \ the scenario of an upstream State Update, there are two possible\n   methods\
    \ for state update.  One is the CN (or the HA, Gateway Foreign\n   Agent (GFA),\
    \ or MAP) sends the refreshing RESERVE message toward the\n   MN to perform State\
    \ Update upon receiving the trigger (e.g., Mobile\n   IP (MIP) binding update).\
    \  The UCRN is discovered implicitly by the\n   CN-initiated signaling along the\
    \ common path as described in\n   Section 4.4.1.  When the refreshing RESERVE\
    \ reaches to the adjacent\n   QNE of UCRN, the QNE sends back a RESPONSE saying\
    \ \"Reduced refreshes\n   not supported; full QSPEC required\" (0x03).  Then,\
    \ the UCRN sends the\n   RESERVE with full QSPEC towards the MN to set up a new\
    \ reservation.\n   The UCRN may also send a tearing RESERVE to the previous downstream\n\
    \   peer.  The tearing RESERVE is forwarded hop-by-hop and reaches the\n   edge\
    \ QNE.  After the QNE is aware that the MN as QNI has disappeared,\n   the QNE\
    \ drops the tearing peer.  Another method is: if a GIST hop is\n   already established\
    \ on the new path (e.g., by QUERY from the CN, or\n   the HA, GFA, or MAP) when\
    \ MN gets a hint from GIST that routing has\n   changed, the MN sends a NOTIFY\
    \ upstream saying \"Route Change\" (0x02).\n   When the NOTIFY hits the UCRN,\
    \ the UCRN is aware that the NOTIFY is\n   for a known session and comes from\
    \ a new SII-Handle.  Then, the UCRN\n   sends towards the MN a RESERVE with a\
    \ new RSN and an RII.  By\n   receiving the RESERVE, the MN replies with a RESPONSE.\
    \  The UCRN may\n   also send tearing RESERVE to previous downstream peer.  The\
    \ tearing\n   RESERVE is forwarded hop-by-hop and reaches to the edge QNE.  After\n\
    \   the QNE is aware that the MN as QNI has disappeared, the QNE drops\n   the\
    \ tearing peer.\n   The State Update on the common path to reflect the changed\
    \ MRI brings\n   issues on the end-to-end signaling addressed in Section 3.  Although\n\
    \   the State Update over the common path does not give rise to re-\n   processing\
    \ of AAA and admission control, it may lead to increased\n   signaling overhead\
    \ and latency.\n   One of the goals of the State Update is to avoid the double\n\
    \   reservation on the common path as described in Section 3.  The double\n  \
    \ reservation problem on the common path can be solved by establishing\n   a signaling\
    \ association using a unique SID and by updating the packet\n   classifier / MRI.\
    \  In this case, even though the flows on the common\n   path have different MRIs,\
    \ they refer to the same NSLP state.\n"

    \ and avoiding\n   address changes.  On the other hand, the MRI [RFC5971] contains\
    \ flow\n   addresses and will change if the CoA changes.  This makes an impact\n\
    \   on some NSLPs such as QoS NSLP and NAT/FW NSLP.\n   QoS NSLP must be mobility-aware\
    \ because it needs to care about the\n   resources on the actual current path,\
    \ and sending a new RESERVE or\n   QUERY for the new path.  Applications on top\
    \ of Mobile IP communicate\n   along logical flows that use home addresses, whereas\
    \ QoS NSLP has to\n   be aware of the actual flow path, e.g., whether the flow\
    \ is currently\n   tunneled or route-optimized, etc.  QoS NSLP may have to obtain\n\
    \   current link properties; especially there may be additional overhead\n   due\
    \ to mobility header extensions that must be taken into account in\n   QSPEC (e.g.,\
    \ the m parameter in the traffic model (TMOD); see\n   [RFC5975]).  Therefore,\
    \ NSLPs must interact with mobility management\n   implementations in order to\
    \ request information about the current\n   flow address (CoAs), source addresses,\
    \ tunneling, or overhead.\n   Furthermore, an implementation must select proper\
    \ interface addresses\n   in the natural language interface (NLI) in order to\
    \ ensure that a\n   corresponding Messaging Association is established along the\
    \ same\n   path as the flow in the MRI.  Moreover, the home agent needs to\n \
    \  perform additional actions (e.g., reservations) for the tunnel.  If\n   the\
    \ home agent lacks support of a mobility-aware QoS NSLP, a missing\n   tunnel\
    \ reservation is usually the result.  Practical problems may\n   occur in situations\
    \ where a home agent needs to send a GIST query\n   (with S-flag=1) towards the\
    \ MN's home address and the query is not\n   tunneled due to route optimization\
    \ between HA and MN: the query will\n   be wrongly intercepted by QNEs within\
    \ the tunnel.\n   NAT/FW box needs to be configured before MIP signaling, hence\
    \ NAT/FW\n   signaling will have to be performed to allow Return Routability Test\n\
    \   (RRT) and Binding Update (BU) / Binding Acknowledgement (BA) messages\n  \
    \ to traverse the NAT/FWs in the path.  After RRT and BU/BA messages\n   are completed,\
    \ more NAT/FW signaling needs to be performed for\n   passing the data.  Optimized\
    \ version can include a combined NAT/FW\n   message to cover both RRT and BU/BA\
    \ messages pattern.  However, this\n   may require NAT/FW NSLP to do a slight\
    \ update to support carrying\n   multiple NAT/FW rules in one signaling round\
    \ trip.\n   This section analyzes NSIS operation with the tunneled route case\n\
    \   especially for QoS NSLP.\n"

  - "5.1.  Interaction with Mobile IPv4\n   In Mobile IPv4 [RFC5944], the data flows\
    \ are forwarded based on\n   triangular routing, and an MN retains a new CoA from\
    \ the Foreign\n   Agent (FA) (or an external method such as DHCP) in the visited\
    \ access\n   network.  When the MN acts as a data sender, the data and signaling\n\
    \   flows sent from the MN are directly transferred to the CN, not\n   necessarily\
    \ through the HA or indirectly through the HA using the\n   reverse tunneling.\
    \  On the other hand, when the MN acts as a data\n   receiver, the data and signaling\
    \ flows sent from the CN are routed\n   through the IP tunneling between the HA\
    \ and the FA (or the HA and the\n   MN in the case of the co-located CoA).  With\
    \ this approach, routing\n   is dependent on the HA, and therefore the NSIS protocols\
    \ interact\n   with the IP tunneling procedure of Mobile IP for signaling.\n \

    \ MIPv4: CN-->MN with co-located CoA\n   Figure 4: NSIS Signaling Flows under\
    \ Different Mobile IPv4 Scenarios\n   When an MN (as a signaling sender) arrives\
    \ at a new FA and the\n   corresponding binding process is completed (Figure 4\
    \ (a), (b), and\n   (c)), the MN performs the CRN discovery (DCRN) and the State\
    \ Update\n   toward the CN (as described in Section 4) to establish the NSIS state\n\
    \   along the new path between the MN and the CN.  In case the reverse\n   tunnel\
    \ is not used (Figure 4 (a)), a new NSIS state is established on\n   the direct\
    \ path from the MN to the CN.  If the reverse tunnel and FA\n   CoA are used (Figure\
    \ 4 (b)), a new NSIS state is established along a\n   tunneling path from the\
    \ FA to the HA separately from the end-to-end\n   path.  CRN discovery and State\
    \ Update in tunneling path is also\n   separately performed if necessary.  If\
    \ the reverse tunnel and co-\n   located CoA are used (Figure 4 (c)), the NSIS\
    \ signaling for the DCRN\n   discovery and for the State Update is the same as\
    \ the case of using\n   the FA CoA above, except for the use of the reverse tunneling\
    \ path\n   from the MN to the HA.  That is, in this case, one of the tunnel\n\
    \   endpoints is the MN, not the FA.\n   When an MN (as a signaling receiver)\
    \ arrives at a new FA and the\n   corresponding binding process is completed (Figure\
    \ 4 (d) and (e)),\n   the MN sends a NOTIFY message to the signaling sender, i.e.,\
    \ the CN.\n   In case the FA CoA is used (Figure 4 (d)), the CN initiates an NSIS\n\
    \   signaling to update an existing state between the CN and the HA, and\n   afterwards\
    \ the NSIS signaling messages are forwarded to the FA and\n   reach the MN.  A\
    \ new NSIS state is established along the tunneling\n   path from the HA to the\
    \ FA separately from end-to-end path.  During\n   this operation, a UCRN is discovered\
    \ on the tunneling path, and a new\n   MRI for the State Update on the tunnel\
    \ may need to be created.  CRN\n   discovery and State Update in the tunneling\
    \ path is also separately\n   performed if necessary.  In case co-located CoA\
    \ is used (Figure 4\n   (d)), the NSIS signaling for the UCRN discovery and for\
    \ the State\n   Update is also the same as the case of using the FA CoA, above\
    \ except\n   for the endpoint of the tunneling path from the HA to the MN.\n \
    \  Note that Mobile IPv4 optionally supports route optimization.  In the\n   case\
    \ route optimization is supported, the signaling operation will be\n   the same\
    \ as Mobile IPv6 route optimization.\n"
- title: 5.2.  Interaction with Mobile IPv6
  contents:
  - "5.2.  Interaction with Mobile IPv6\n   Unlike Mobile IPv4, with Mobile IPv6 [RFC3775],\
    \ the FA is not\n   required on the data path.  If an MN moves to a visited network,\
    \ a\n   CoA at the network is allocated like co-located CoA in Mobile IPv4.\n\
    \   In addition, the route optimization process between the MN and CN can\n  \
    \ be used to avoid the triangular routing in the Mobile IPv4 scenarios.\n   If\
    \ the route optimization is not used, data flow routing and NSIS\n   signaling\
    \ procedures (including the CRN discovery and the State\n   Update) will be similar\
    \ to the case of using Mobile IPv4 with the co-\n   located CoA.  However, if\
    \ route optimization is used, signaling\n   messages are sent directly from the\
    \ MN to the CN, or from the CN to\n   the MN.  Therefore, route change procedures\
    \ described in Section 4\n   are applicable to this case.\n"

  - "5.3.  Interaction with Mobile IP Tunneling\n   In this section, we assume that\
    \ the MN acts as an NI and the CN acts\n   as an NR in interworking between Mobile\
    \ IP and NSIS signaling.\n   Scenarios for interaction with Mobile IP tunneling\
    \ vary depending on:\n   -  Whether a tunneling entry point (Tentry) is an MN\
    \ or other node.\n      For a Mobile IPv4 co-located CoA or Mobile IPv6 CoA, Tentry\
    \ is an\n      MN.  For a Mobile IPv4 FA CoA, Tentry is an FA.  In both cases,\

    \ Whether the operation mode over the tunnel is with preconfigured\n      QoS\

- title: 5.3.1.  Sender-Initiated Reservation with Mobile IP Tunnel
  contents:
  - "5.3.1.  Sender-Initiated Reservation with Mobile IP Tunnel\n   The following\
    \ scenario assumes that an FA is a Tentry.  However, the\n   procedure is the\
    \ same when an MN is a Tentry if the MN and the FA are\n   considered the same\
    \ node.\n   -  When an MN moves into a new network attachment point, QoS NSLP\
    \ in\n      the MN initiates the RESERVE (end-to-end) message to start the\n \
    \     State Update procedure.  The GIST below the QoS NSLP adds the GIST\n   \
    \   header and then sends the encapsulated RESERVE message to peer\n      GIST\
    \ node with the corresponding QoS NSLP.  In this case, the peer\n      GIST node\
    \ is an FA if the FA is an NSIS-aware node.  The FA is one\n      of the endpoints\
    \ of Mobile IP tunneling: Tentry.  For proper NSIS\n      tunneling operation,\
    \ a Mobile IP endpoint is required to be NSIS\n      tunneling aware.  In case\
    \ of interaction with tunnel signaling\n      originated from the FA, there can\
    \ be two scenarios depending on\n      whether or not the tunnel already has preconfigured\
    \ QoS sessions.\n      In the former case, the FA map end-to-end QoS signaling\
    \ requests\n      directly to existing tunnel sessions.  In the latter case, the\
    \ FA\n      dynamically initiates and maintains tunnel QoS sessions that are\n\
    \      then associated with the corresponding end-to-end QoS sessions.\n     \
    \ [RFC5979].\n   -  Figure 5 shows the typical NSIS operation over tunnels with\n\
    \      preconfigured QoS sessions.  Both the FA and the HA are configured\n  \
    \    with information about the Flow ID of the tunnel QoS session.\n      Upon\
    \ receiving a RESERVE message from the MN, the FA checks tunnel\n      QoS configuration,\
    \ and determines whether and how this end-to-end\n      session can be mapped\
    \ to a preconfigured tunnel session.  The FA\n      then tunnels the RESERVE message\
    \ to the HA.  The CN replies with a\n      RESPONSE message which arrives at the\
    \ HA, the FA, and the MN.\n   -  Figure 6 shows the typical NSIS operation over\
    \ tunnels with\n      dynamically created QoS sessions.  When the FA receives\
    \ an end-to-\n      end RESERVE message from the MN, the FA chooses the tunnel\
    \ Flow\n      ID, creates the tunnel session, and associates the end-to-end\n\
    \      session with the tunnel session.  The FA then sends a tunnel\n      RESERVE'\
    \ message (matching the request of the end-to-end session)\n      towards the\
    \ HA to reserve tunnel resources.  The tunnel RESERVE'\n      message is processed\
    \ hop-by-hop inside the tunnel for the flow\n      identified by the chosen tunnel\
    \ Flow ID, while the end-to-end\n      RESERVE message passes through the tunnel\
    \ intermediate nodes\n      (Tmid).  When these two messages arrive at the HA,\
    \ the HA creates\n      the reservation state for the tunnel session, and sends\
    \ a tunnel\n      RESPONSE' message to the FA.  At the same time, the HA updates\
    \ the\n      end-to-end RESERVE message based on the result of the tunnel\n  \
    \    session reservation and forwards the end-to-end RESERVE message\n      along\
    \ the path towards the CN.  When the CN receives the end-to-\n      end RESERVE\
    \ message, it sends an end-to-end RESPONSE message back\n      to the MN.\n  \

  - "5.3.3.  CRN Discovery and State Update with Mobile IP Tunneling\n   If a tunnel\
    \ is in the mode of using dynamically created QoS sessions,\n   the Mobile IP\
    \ tunneling scenario can include two types of CRNs, i.e.,\n   a CRN on an end-to-end\
    \ path and a CRN on a tunneling path.  If a\n   tunnel is in the mode of using\
    \ preconfigured QoS sessions, it can\n   only have CRNs on end-to-end paths. \
    \ CRN discovery and State Update\n   for these two paths are operated independently.\n\
    \   CRN discovery for an end-to-end path is initiated by the MN by\n   sending\
    \ a RESERVE (sender-initiated case) or QUERY (receiver-\n   initiated case) message.\
    \  As the MN uses HoA as the source address\n   even after handover, a CRN is\
    \ found by normal route change process\n   (i.e., the same SID and Flow ID, but\
    \ a different SII-Handle).  If an\n   HA is QoS NSLP aware, the HA is found as\
    \ the CRN.  The CRN initiates\n   the tearing-down process on the old path as\
    \ described in [RFC5974].\n   CRN discovery for the tunneling path is initiated\
    \ by Tentry by\n   sending a RESERVE' (sender-initiated case) or QUERY' (receiver-\n\
    \   initiated case) message.  The route change procedures described in\n   Section\
    \ 4 are applicable to this case.\n   The end-to-end state inside the tunnel should\
    \ not be torn down until\n   all states inside the tunnel have been torn from\
    \ the implementation\n   perspective.  However, detailed discussions are out of\

  contents:
  - "6.1.1.  Selecting the Best Interface(s) or CoA(s)\n   In the MIPv6 route optimization\
    \ case, if registrations of multiple\n   CoAs are provided [RFC5648], the contents\
    \ of QUERYs sent by candidate\n   CoAs can be used to select the best interface(s)\
    \ or CoA(s).\n   Assume that an MN is a data sender and has multiple interfaces.\
    \  Now\n   the MN moves to a new location and acquires CoA(s) for multiple\n \
    \  interfaces.  After the MN performs the BU/BA procedure, it sends\n   QUERY\
    \ messages toward the CN through the interface(s) associated with\n   the CoA(s).\
    \  On receiving the QUERY messages, the CN or gateway,\n   determines the best\
    \ (primary) CoA(s) by checking the 'QoS Available'\n   object in the QUERY messages.\
    \  Then, a RESERVE message is sent toward\n   the MN to reserve resources along\
    \ the path that the primary CoA\n   takes.  If the reservation is not successful,\
    \ the CN transmits\n   another RESERVE message using the CoA with the next highest\
    \ priority.\n   The CRN may initiate a teardown (RESERVE with the TEAR flag set)\n\
    \   message toward old access router (OAR) to release the reserved\n   resources\
    \ on the old path.\n   For a sender-initiated reservation, a similar approach\

  - "6.1.2.  Differentiation of Two Types of CRNs\n   When multiple interfaces of\
    \ the MN are simultaneously used for load-\n   balancing purposes, a possible\
    \ approach for distinguishing the LB-CRN\n   and HO-CRN will introduce an identifier\
    \ to determine the relationship\n   between interfaces and paths.\n   An MN uses\
    \ interface 1 and interface 2 for the same session, where\n   the paths (say path\
    \ 1 and path 2) have the same SID but different\n   Flow IDs as shown in (a) of\
    \ Figure 10.  Then, one of the interfaces\n   of the MN performs a handover and\
    \ obtains a new CoA, and the MN will\n   try to establish a new path (say Path\
    \ 3) with the new Flow ID, as\n   shown in (b) of Figure 10.  In this case, the\

    \   Update can be localized by address mapping.  However, how the State\n   Update\
    \ is performed with scoped signaling messages within the access\n   network under\
    \ the MAP is for future study.\n   In the interdomain handover, a possible way\
    \ to mitigate the latency\n   penalty is to use the multihomed MN.  It is also\
    \ possible to allow\n   the NSIS protocols to interact with mobility protocols\
    \ such as\n   Seamoby protocols (e.g., Candidate Access Router Discovery (CARD)\n\
    \   [RFC4066] and the Context Transfer Protocol (CXTP) [RFC4067]) and\n   Fast\
    \ Mobile IP (FMIP).  Another scenario is to use a peering\n   agreement that allows\
    \ aggregation authorization to be performed for\n   aggregate reservation on an\
    \ interdomain link without authorizing each\n   individual session.  How these\
    \ approaches can be used in NSIS\n   signaling is for further study.\n"

  - "6.3.  Intermediate Node Becomes a Dead Peer\n   The failure of a (potential)\
    \ NSIS CRN may result in incomplete state\n   re-establishment on the new path\
    \ and incomplete teardown on the old\n   path after handover.  In this case, a\
    \ new CRN should be rediscovered\n   immediately by the CRN discovery procedure.\n\
    \   The failure of an AR may make the interactions with Seamoby protocols\n  \
    \ (such as CARD and CXTP) impossible.  In this case, the neighboring\n   peer\
    \ closest to the dead AR may need to interact with such protocols.\n   A more\
    \ detailed analysis of interactions with Seamoby protocols is\n   left for future\
    \ work.\n   In Mobile-IP-based scenarios, the failures of NSIS functions at an\
    \ FA\n   and an HA may result in incomplete interaction with IP tunneling.  In\n\
    \   this case, recovery for NSIS functions needs to be performed\n   immediately.\
    \  In addition, a more detailed analysis of interactions\n   with IP tunneling\
    \ is left for future work.\n"

    \ concerns.  The security\n   considerations pertaining to the NSIS protocol specifications,\n\
    \   especially [RFC5971], [RFC5973], and [RFC5974], remain relevant.\n   When\
    \ deployed in service provider networks, it is mandatory to ensure\n   that only\
    \ authorized entities are permitted to initiate re-\n   establishment and removal\
    \ of NSIS states in mobile environments,\n   including the use of NSIS proxies\
    \ and CRNs.\n"
