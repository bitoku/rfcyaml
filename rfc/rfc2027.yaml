  - "1.  Introduction\n   By 1992, many aspects of the operation of the Internet Architecture\n\
    \   Board (IAB), Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), and the Internet\n  \
    \ Engineering Steering Group (IESG) had been reviewed and changes were\n   being\
    \ implemented.  Included in those changes was the process by\n   which members\
    \ of the IAB and IESG are selected, confirmed, and\n   recalled.  Since 1992,\
    \ the process of selection and confirmation has\n   been exercised four times:\
    \ 1992, 1993, 1994, and 1995.  The recall\n   process has not been exercised.\n\
    \   A single paragraph in RFC1602 is the extent to which the process has\n   been\
    \ formally recorded to date.  Informally, following the 1992\n   exercise of the\
    \ process, an internet draft was distributed recording\n   many of the details\
    \ of the operation of that first nominating\n   committee.  In addition, in both\
    \ 1994 and 1995, the POISED working\n   group met, which facilitated the \"oral\
    \ tradition\" transference of the\n   selection and confirmation process lessons\
    \ learned, including the\n   email archives of the working group mailing list.\
    \  This document is a\n   self-consistent, organized compilation of the process\
    \ as described by\n   each of these sources.\n   The process described here includes\
    \ only items for which the\n   consensus of those participating in the various\
    \ discussions was\n   easily recognized.  As a result, two assumptions are made.\n\
    \   (1)  The Internet Research Task Force (IRTF) and Internet\n        Research\
    \ Steering Group (IRSG) are not a part of the process\n        described here.\n\
    \   (2)  The organization (and re-organization) of the IESG is not a\n       \
    \ part of the process described here.\n   In addition, this document specifies\
    \ time frames for which the frame\n   of reference is IETF meetings.  The time\
    \ frames assume that the IETF\n   meets at least once per year with that meeting\
    \ occurring during the\n   North American Spring time, i.e., the IETF meets at\
    \ least on or about\n   March of each year.\n   The remainder of this document\
    \ is divided into four major topics as\n   follows.\n   General\n        This\
    \ a set of rules and constraints that apply to the\n        selection and confirmation\
    \ process as a whole.\n   Nominating Committee Selection\n        This is the\
    \ process by which volunteers from the IETF\n        community are recognized\
    \ to serve on the committee that\n        nominates candidates to serve on the\
    \ IESG and IAB.\n   Nominating Committee Operation\n        This is the set of\
    \ principles, rules, and constraints\n        that guide the activities of the\
    \ nominating committee,\n        including the confirmation process.\n   Member\
    \ Recall\n        This is the process by which the behavior of a sitting\n   \
    \     member of the IESG or IAB may be questioned, perhaps\n        resulting\
    \ in the removal of the sitting member.\n"

  contents:
  - "2.  General\n   The following set of rules apply to the selection and confirmation\n\
    \   process as a whole.  If necessary, a paragraph discussing the\n   interpretation\
    \ of each rule is included.\n   (1)  The principal function of the nominating\
    \ committee is to\n        recruit and nominate candidates for open IESG and IAB\n\
    \        positions.\n        The nominating committee does not select the open\
    \ positions\n        to be filled; it is instructed as to which positions to fill.\n\
    \        At a minimum, the nominating committee will be given the title\n    \
    \    of the position to be filled.  The nominating committee may be\n        given\
    \ a desirable set of qualifications for the candidates\n        nominated to fill\
    \ a position.  The nominating committee does not\n        confirm its candidates;\
    \ it presents its candidates to the\n        appropriate confirming body as indicated\
    \ below.\n   (2)  The annual selection and confirmation process is expected to\
    \ be\n        completed within 3 months.\n        The annual selection and confirmation\
    \ process is expected to be\n        completed one month prior to the friday of\
    \ the week before the\n        Spring IETF.  It is expected to begin 4 months\
    \ prior to the\n        friday of the week before the Spring IETF.\n   (3)  One-half\
    \ of each of the then current IESG and IAB positions is\n        selected to be\
    \ refilled each year.\n        A given position is selected every other year.\
    \  The intent is to\n        replace no more than 50% of the sitting IESG and\
    \ IAB members in\n        any one year.\n        A position may be refilled with\
    \ its sitting member, if the\n        sitting member is nominated by the nominating\
    \ committee.\n   (4)  Confirmed candidates are expected to serve at least a 2\
    \ year\n        term.\n        All member terms end during the Spring IETF meeting\n\
    \        corresponding to the end of the term for which they were\n        confirmed.\
    \  The term ends no later than the second to last\n        day and no sooner than\
    \ the Open Plenary session of the Spring\n        IETF, as determined by the mutual\
    \ agreement of the confirmed\n        candidate and the currently sitting member.\
    \  The term begins no\n        later than the last day and no sooner than the\
    \ Open Plenary\n        session of the Spring IETF meeting, as determined by the\
    \ mutual\n        agreement of the confirmed candidate and the currently sitting\n\
    \        member.\n   (5)  Mid-term IESG vacancies are filled by the same rules\
    \ as\n        documented here with four qualifications.  First, the most\n   \
    \     recently constituted nominating committee is reconvened to\n        nominate\
    \ a candidate to fill the vacancy.  Second, the\n        selection and confirmation\
    \ process is expected to be completed\n        within 1 month, with a prorated\
    \ time period for all other time\n        periods not otherwise specified.  Third,\
    \ the confirming body\n        has two weeks from the day it is notified of a\
    \ candidate to\n        reject the candidate, otherwise the candidate is assumed\
    \ to\n        have been confirmed.  Fourth, the term of the confirmed\n      \
    \  candidate will be either:\n   a.   the remainder of the term of the open position\
    \ if that remainder\n        is not less than one year.\n   b.   the remainder\
    \ of the term of the open position plus the next\n        2 year term if that\
    \ remainder is less than one year.\n   (6)  Mid-term IAB vacancies are filled\
    \ by the same rules as\n        documented here with four qualifications.  First,\
    \ the most\n        recently constituted nominating committee is reconvened to\n\
    \        nominate a candidate to fill the vacancy.  Second, the selection\n  \
    \      and confirmation process is expected to be completed within\n        1\
    \ month, with a prorated time period for all other time periods\n        not otherwise\
    \ specified.  Third, the confirming body has two\n        weeks from the day it\
    \ is notified of a candidate to reject the\n        candidate, otherwise the candidate\
    \ is assumed to have been\n        confirmed.  Fourth, the term of the confirmed\
    \ candidate will\n        be either:\n   a.   the remainder of the term of the\
    \ open position if that remainder\n        is not less than one year.\n   b. \
    \  the remainder of the term of the open position plus the next\n        2 year\
    \ term if that remainder is less than one year.\n   (7)  All deliberations and\
    \ supporting information of all the\n        participants in the selection and\
    \ confirmation process are\n        private. The nominating committee and confirming\
    \ body members\n        will be exposed to confidential information as a result\
    \ of\n        their deliberations, their interactions with those they consult,\n\
    \        and from nominees who provide requested supporting information.\n   \
    \     All members and all other participants are expected to handle\n        this\
    \ information in a manner consistent with its sensitivity.\n   (8)  Unless otherwise\
    \ specified, the advise and consent model is used\n        throughout the process.\
    \  This model is characterized as follows.\n   a.   The IETF Executive Director\
    \ advises the nominating committee of\n        the IESG and IAB positions to be\
    \ refilled.\n   b.   The nominating committee selects candidates and advises the\n\
    \        confirming bodies of them.\n   c.   The sitting IAB members review the\
    \ IESG candidates, consenting\n        to some, all, or none.\n        If all\
    \ of the candidates are confirmed, the job of the\n        nominating committee\
    \ with respect to filling the open IESG\n        positions is considered complete.\
    \  If some or none of the\n        candidates are confirmed, the nominating committee\
    \ must\n        reconvene to select alternate candidates for the rejected\n  \
    \      candidates.  Any additional time required by the nominating\n        committee\
    \ should not exceed its maximum time allotment.\n   d.   The Internet Society\
    \ Board of Trustees reviews the IAB\n        candidates, consenting to some, all,\
    \ or none.\n        If all of the candidates are confirmed, the job of the\n \
    \       nominating committee with respect to filling the open IAB\n        positions\
    \ is considered complete.  If some or none of the\n        candidates are confirmed,\
    \ the nominating committee must\n        reconvene to select alternate candidates\
    \ for the rejected\n        candidates.  Any additional time required by the nominating\n\
    \        committee should not exceed its maximum time allotment.\n   e.   The\
    \ confirming bodies decide their consent according to a\n        mechanism of\
    \ their own choosing, which must ensure that at\n        least one-half of the\
    \ sitting members agree with the\n        decision.\n        At least one-half\
    \ of the sitting members of the confirming\n        bodies must agree to either\
    \ confirm or reject each individual\n        nominee. The agreement must be decided\
    \ within a reasonable\n        timeframe.  The agreement may be decided by conducting\
    \ a\n        formal vote, by asserting consensus based on informal\n        exchanges\
    \ (email), or by whatever mechanism is used to\n        conduct the normal business\
    \ of the confirming body.\n"

  - "4.  Nominating Committee Operation\n   The following rules apply to the operation\
    \ of the nominating\n   committee.  If necessary, a paragraph discussing the interpretation\n\
    \   of each rule is included.\n   The rules are organized approximately in the\
    \ order in which they\n   would be invoked.\n   The term nominee refers to an\
    \ individual under consideration by the\n   nominating committee.  The term candidate\
    \ efers to a nominee that has\n   been selected by the nominating committee to\
    \ be considered for\n   confirmation by a confirming body.  A confirmed candidate\
    \ is a\n   candidate that has been reviewed and approved by a confirming body.\n\
    \   (1)  All rules and special circumstances not otherwise specified\n       \
    \ are at the discretion of the Chair.\n        Exceptional circumstances will\
    \ occasionally arise during the\n        normal operation of the nominating committee.\
    \  This rule is\n        intended to foster the continued forward progress of\
    \ the\n        committee.  All members of the committee should consider\n    \
    \    whether the exception is worthy of mention in the next\n        revision\
    \ of this document and followup accordingly.\n   (2)  The Chair must establish\
    \ and publicize milestones, which must\n        include at least a call for nominations.\n\
    \        There is a defined time period during which the selection and\n     \
    \   confirmation process must be completed.  The Chair must\n        establish\
    \ a set of milestones which, if met in a timely\n        fashion, will result\
    \ in the completion of the process on\n        time.  The Chair should allow time\
    \ for iterating the\n        activities of the committee if one or more candidates\n\
    \        is not confirmed.\n        The milestones must be publicized using at\
    \ least the same\n        mechanism used by the IETF secretariat for its announcements.\n\
    \   (3)  The Chair must establish a voting mechanism.\n        The committee must\
    \ be able to objectively determine when\n        a decision has been made during\
    \ its deliberations.  The\n        criteria for determining closure must be established\
    \ and\n        known to all members of the nominating committee.\n   (4)  At least\
    \ a quorum of committee members must participate in\n        a vote. A quorum\
    \ is comprised of at least 7 voting members.\n   (5)  The Chair may establish\
    \ a process by which a member of the\n        nominating committee may be recalled.\n\
    \        The process, if established, must be agreed to by a 3/4\n        majority\
    \ of the members of the nominating committee,\n        including the non-voting\
    \ members since they would be\n        subject to the same process.\n   (6)  All\
    \ members of the nominating committee may participate in all\n        deliberations.\n\
    \        The emphasis of this rule is that no member, whether voting or\n    \
    \    non-voting, can be explicitly excluded from any deliberation.\n        However,\
    \ a member may individually choose not to participate\n        in a deliberation.\n\
    \   (7)  The Chair announces the open positions to be filled and\n        the\
    \ call for nominees.\n        The announcements must be publicized using at least\
    \ the same\n        mechanism used by the IETF secretariat for its announcements.\n\
    \   (8)  Any member of the IETF community may nominate any member\n        of\
    \ the IETF community for any open position.\n        A self-nomination is permitted.\n\
    \   (9)  Nominating committee members must not be nominees.\n        To be a nominee\
    \ is to enter the process of being selected\n        as a candidate and confirmed.\
    \  Nominating committee members\n        are not eligible to be considered for\
    \ filling any open\n        position.\n   (10) Members of the IETF community who\
    \ were recalled from any\n        IESG or IAB position during the previous two\
    \ years must\n        not be nominees.\n   (11) The nominating committee selects\
    \ candidates based on its\n        understanding of the IETF community's consensus\
    \ of the\n        qualifications required to fill the open positions.\n   (12)\
    \ Nominees should be advised that they are being considered\n        and must\
    \ consent to their nomination prior to being\n        confirmed.\n        The\
    \ nominating committee should help nominees provide\n        justification to\
    \ their employers.\n        A nominee's consent must be written (email is acceptable)\n\
    \        and include a commitment to provide the resources necessary\n       \
    \ to fill the open position and an assurance that the nominee\n        will perform\
    \ the duties of the position for which they are\n        being considered in the\
    \ best interests of the IETF community.\n   (13) The nominating committee advises\
    \ the confirming bodies of\n        their candidates, specifying a single candidate\
    \ for each\n        open position and a testament as to how each candidate\n \
    \       meets the qualifications of an open position.\n        The testament may\
    \ include a brief resume of the candidate\n        and a summary of the deliberations\
    \ of the nominating committee.\n   (14) With respect to any action to be taken\
    \ in the context of\n        notifying and announcing confirmed candidates, and\
    \ notifying\n        rejected nominees and candidates, the action must be valid\n\
    \        according to all of the rules specified below prior to its\n        execution.\n\
    \   a.   Up until a candidate is confirmed, the identity of the\n        candidate\
    \ must be kept strictly confidential.\n   b.   The identity of all nominees must\
    \ be kept strictly confidential\n        (except that the nominee may publicize\
    \ their intentions).\n   c.   Rejected nominees may be notified as soon as they\
    \ are rejected.\n   d.   Rejected candidates may be notified as soon as they are\
    \ rejected.\n   e.   Rejected nominees and candidates must be notified prior to\n\
    \        announcing confirmed candidates.\n   f.   Confirmed candidates may be\
    \ notified and announced as soon as\n        they are confirmed.\n        It is\
    \ consistent with these rules for a nominee to never know if\n        they were\
    \ a candidate or not.\n        It is consistent with these rules for a nominating\
    \ committee to\n        reject some nominees early in the process and to keep\
    \ some\n        nominees as alternates in case a candidate is rejected by a\n\
    \        confirming body. In the matter of whether a confirmed candidate\n   \
    \     was a first choice or an alternate, that information need not\n        ever\
    \ be disclosed and, in fact, probably never should be.\n        It is consistent\
    \ with these rules for confirmed candidates\n        to be notified and announced\
    \ as quickly as possible instead\n        of requiring all confirmed candidates\
    \ to wait until all open\n        positions have been refilled.\n        The announcements\
    \ must be publicized using at least the same\n        mechanism used by the IETF\
    \ secretariat for its announcements.\n"
