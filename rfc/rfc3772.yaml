    \  (LCP) and a method for negotiating the use of multi-protocol traffic\n   over
    point-to-point links.  The PPP Vendor Extensions document adds\n   vendor-specific
    general-purpose Configuration Option and Code\n   numbers.  This document extends
    these features to cover vendor-\n   specific Network, Authentication, and Control
    Protocols.\n"
  title: Abstract
- contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   PPP's [1] Vendor Extensions [3] defines a general-purpose
    mechanism\n   for the negotiation of various vendor-proprietary options and\n
    \  extensions to the kinds of control messages that may be sent via the\n   Code
    field.\n   Some implementors may want to define proprietary network and control\n
    \  protocols in addition to the already-described features.  While it\n   would
    be possible for such an implementor to use the existing LCP\n   Vendor-Specific
    Option to enable the use of the proprietary protocol,\n   this staged negotiation
    (enable via LCP, then negotiate via some\n   locally-assigned protocol number)
    suffers from at least three\n   problems:\n   First, because it would be in LCP,
    the negotiation of the use of the\n   protocol would begin before identification
    and authentication of the\n   peer had been done.  This complicates the security
    analysis of the\n   feature and constrains the way in which the protocol might
    be\n   deployed.\n   Second, where compulsory tunneling is in use, the system
    performing\n   the initial LCP negotiation may be unrelated to the system that
    uses\n   the proprietary protocol.  In such a scenario, enabling the protocol\n
    \  at LCP time would require either LCP renegotiation or support of the\n   proprietary
    protocol in the initial negotiator, both of which raise\n   deployment problems.\n
    \  Third, the fact that any protocol negotiated via such a mechanism\n   would
    necessarily use a protocol number that is not assigned by IANA\n   complicates
    matters for diagnostic tools used to monitor the\n   datastream.  Having a fixed
    number allows these tools to display such\n   protocols in a reasonable, albeit
    limited, format.\n   A cleaner solution is thus to define a set of vendor-specific\n
    \  protocols, one in each of the four protocol number ranges defined by\n   [1].
    \ This specification reserves the following values:\n   Value (in hex)  Protocol
    Name\n   005b            Vendor-Specific Network Protocol (VSNP)\n   405b            Vendor-Specific
    Protocol (VSP)\n   805b            Vendor-Specific Network Control Protocol (VSNCP)\n
    \  c05b            Vendor-Specific Authentication Protocol (VSAP)\n   The key
    words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\",
    \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n   document
    are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, RFC 2119 [2].\n"

  - "2.  PPP Vendor-Specific Network Control Protocol (VSNCP)\n   The Vendor-Specific
    Network Control Protocol (VSNCP) is responsible\n   for negotiating the use of
    the Vendor-Specific Network Protocol\n   (VSNP).  VSNCP uses the same packet exchange
    and option negotiation\n   mechanism as LCP, but with a different set of options.\n
    \  VSNCP packets MUST NOT be exchanged until PPP has reached the\n   Network-Layer
    Protocol phase.  Any VSNCP packets received when not in\n   that phase MUST be
    silently ignored.  If a VSNCP packet with an\n   unrecognized OUI is received,
    an LCP Protocol-Reject SHOULD be sent\n   in response.\n   The network layer data,
    carried in VSNP packets, MUST NOT be sent\n   unless VSNCP is in Opened state.
    \ If a VSNP packet is received when\n   VSNCP is not in Opened state and LCP is
    Opened, the implementation\n   MAY respond using LCP Protocol-Reject.\n"

    Unique Identifier (OUI) used in the\n   messages described in this document identifies
    an organization\n   (\"vendor\") that defines the meaning of the message.  This
    OUI is\n   based on IEEE 802 vendor assignments.\n   Vendors that desire to use
    their IEEE 802 OUI for a PPP Vendor\n   Protocol SHOULD also register the assigned
    OUI with IANA for the\n   benefit of the community.\n   A vendor that does not
    otherwise need an IEEE-assigned OUI can\n   request a PPP-specific OUI from the
    IANA.  This OUI shall be assigned\n   from the CF0000 series.  This procedure
    is defined for vendors that\n   are not able to use IEEE assignments, such as
    software-only vendors.\n"
  title: 5.  Organizationally Unique Identifiers
- contents:
  - "6.  Multiple Vendor-Specific Protocols\n   Vendors are encouraged to define their
    protocols to allow for future\n   expansion, where necessary.  For example, it
    may be appropriate for a\n   VSNP to include a locally-defined selector field
    to distinguish among\n   multiple proprietary protocols carried via this mechanism,
    and\n   appropriate Configuration Options in VSNCP to enable and disable\n   these
    sub-protocols.  Because the requirements of such a selector are\n   known only
    to the vendor defining such protocols, they are not\n   described further in this
    document.\n   An implementation MAY also support more than one vendor-specific\n
    \  protocol, distinguished by OUI.  In this case, the implementation\n   MUST
    also treat LCP Protocol-Reject specially by examining the OUI\n   field in the
    rejected message and disabling only the protocol to\n   which it refers, rather
    than all use of the vendor-specific protocol\n   number.  Note that such an implementation
    is compatible with a simple\n   implementation that supports only one OUI: that
    implementation will\n   respond with LCP Protocol-Reject for unrecognized OUIs
    and otherwise\n   leave the negotiation state unmodified.\n   An OUI-distinguished
    mechanism is expected to be used only in the\n   case of cooperating vendors.
    \ Vendors are encouraged to use just a\n   single OUI for all protocols defined
    by that vendor, if possible.\n"

  - "7.  Multilink, Compression, and Encryption Considerations\n   The Vendor-Specific
    Network Protocol (VSNP) is defined to operate at\n   the bundle level if Multilink
    PPP [6] is in use, and also above any\n   Compression Protocols [7] and Encryption
    Protocols [8] in use.\n   The Vendor-Specific Protocol (VSP) is defined to operate
    at the per-\n   link level if Multilink PPP is in use, and MUST NOT be subjected
    to\n   data compression.  If a per-link encryption protocol is in use, then\n
    \  VSP packets MUST be encrypted.\n   Note that because VSP is defined at the
    per-link level, bundle level\n   encryption does not affect VSP.\n"

  - "8.  Security Considerations\n   The security of any vendor-specific authentication
    protocol is\n   subject to the provisions of that proprietary mechanism.\n   Implementations
    that wish to avoid security problems associated with\n   such protocols SHOULD
    send LCP Configure-Nak in response to an LCP\n   Configure-Request specifying
    VSAP, or MAY terminate operation.\n   When operating with PPP encryption, but
    without Multilink PPP, VSP\n   packets are sent in the clear.  Implementations
    that require PPP\n   encryption as part of a security mechanism should consider
    whether to\n   employ per-link encryption or forego use of VSP in favor of VSNP.\n
    \  The security of vendor-specific networking protocols is likewise\n   subject
    to the security mechanisms defined by those protocols.\n   Independent analysis
    of the security of any such protocol is\n   RECOMMENDED.\n"

    \  document.\n   As described in Section 5 above and in [3], the IANA also maintains
    a\n   CF0000 series block of non-IEEE OUIs that may be allocated for\n   vendors
