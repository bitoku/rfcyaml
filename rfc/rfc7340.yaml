  - "Abstract\n   Over the past decade, Voice over IP (VoIP) systems based on SIP\
    \ have\n   replaced many traditional telephony deployments.  Interworking VoIP\n\
    \   systems with the traditional telephone network has reduced the\n   overall\
    \ level of calling party number and Caller ID assurances by\n   granting attackers\
    \ new and inexpensive tools to impersonate or\n   obscure calling party numbers\
    \ when orchestrating bulk commercial\n   calling schemes, hacking voicemail boxes,\
    \ or even circumventing\n   multi-factor authentication systems trusted by banks.\
    \  Despite\n   previous attempts to provide a secure assurance of the origin of\
    \ SIP\n   communications, we still lack effective standards for identifying the\n\
    \   calling party in a VoIP session.  This document examines the reasons\n   why\
    \ providing identity for telephone numbers on the Internet has\n   proven so difficult\
    \ and shows how changes in the last decade may\n   provide us with new strategies\
    \ for attaching a secure identity to SIP\n   sessions.  It also gives high-level\
    \ requirements for a solution in\n   this space.\n"

  - "1.  Introduction\n   In many communication architectures that allow users to\
    \ communicate\n   with other users, the need arises for identifying the originating\n\
    \   party that initiates a call or a messaging interaction.  The desire\n   to\
    \ identify communication parties in end-to-end communication derives\n   from\
    \ the need to implement authorization policies (to grant or reject\n   call attempts)\
    \ but has also been utilized for charging.  While there\n   are a number of ways\
    \ to enable identification, this functionality has\n   been provided by the Session\
    \ Initiation Protocol (SIP) [RFC3261] by\n   using two main types of approaches,\
    \ namely, P-Asserted-Identity (PAI)\n   [RFC3325] and SIP Identity [RFC4474],\
    \ which are described in more\n   detail in Section 5.  The goal of these mechanisms\
    \ is to validate\n   that the originator of a call is authorized to claim an originating\n\
    \   identifier.  Protocols like the Extensible Messaging and Presence\n   Protocol\
    \ (XMPP) use mechanisms that are conceptually similar to those\n   offered by\
    \ SIP.\n   Although solutions have been standardized, it turns out that the\n\
    \   current deployment situation is unsatisfactory, and even worse, there\n  \
    \ is little indication that it will improve in the future.  In\n   [SECURE-ORIGIN],\
    \ we illustrate what challenges arise.  In particular,\n   interworking with different\
    \ communication architectures (e.g., SIP,\n   Public Switched Telephone Network\
    \ (PSTN), XMPP, Real-Time\n   Communications on the Web (RTCWeb)) or other forms\
    \ of mediation\n   breaks the end-to-end semantic of the communication interaction\
    \ and\n   destroys any identification capabilities.  (In this document, we use\n\
    \   the term \"PSTN\" colloquially rather than in a legal or policy sense,\n \
    \  as a common shorthand for the circuit-switched analog and time-\n   division\
    \ multiplexing (TDM) digital telephone system, often using\n   Signaling System\
    \ #7 (SS7) to control call setup and teardown.)\n   Furthermore, the use of different\
    \ identifiers (e.g., E.164 numbers\n   vs. SIP URIs) creates challenges for determining\
    \ who is able to claim\n   \"ownership\" for a specific identifier; although domain-based\n\
    \   identifiers (sip:user@example.com) might use certificate or DNS-\n   related\
    \ approaches to determine who is able to claim \"ownership\" of\n   the URI, telephone\
    \ numbers do not yet have any similar mechanism\n   defined.\n   After the publication\
    \ of the PAI and SIP Identity specifications\n   ([RFC3325] and [RFC4474], respectively),\
    \ further attempts have been\n   made to tackle the topic but, unfortunately,\
    \ with little success, due\n   to the complexity of deploying solutions and the\
    \ long list of (often\n   conflicting) requirements.  A number of years have passed\
    \ since the\n   last attempts were made to improve the situation, and we therefore\n\
    \   believe it is time to give it another try.  With this document, we\n   would\
    \ like to start to develop a common understanding of the problem\n   statement\
    \ as well as basic requirements to develop a vision on how to\n   advance the\
    \ state of the art and to initiate technical work to enable\n   secure call origin\
    \ identification.\n"
- title: 2.  Problem Statement
  contents:
  - "2.  Problem Statement\n   In the classical Public Switched Telephone Network,\
    \ there were a\n   limited number of carriers, all of whom trusted each other\
    \ to provide\n   accurate caller origination information in an environment without\
    \ any\n   cryptographic validation.  In some cases, national telecommunication\n\
    \   regulation codified these obligations.  This model worked as long as\n   the\
    \ number of entities was relatively small, easily identified (e.g.,\n   in the\
    \ manner carriers are certified in the United States), and\n   subject to effective\
    \ legal sanctions in case of misbehavior.\n   However, for some time, these assumptions\
    \ have no longer held true.\n   For example, entities that are not traditional\
    \ telecommunication\n   carriers, possibly located outside the country whose country\
    \ code\n   they are using, can act as voice service providers.  While there was\n\
    \   a clear distinction between customers and service providers in the\n   past,\
    \ VoIP service providers can now easily act as customers or\n   either originating\
    \ or transit providers.  Moreover, the problem is\n   not limited to voice communications,\
    \ as growth in text messaging has\n   made it another vector for bulk unsolicited\
    \ commercial messaging\n   relying on impersonation of a source telephone number\
    \ or, sometimes,\n   an SMS short code.  For telephony, Caller ID spoofing has\
    \ become\n   common, with a small subset of entities either ignoring abuse of\n\
    \   their services or willingly serving to enable fraud and other illegal\n  \
    \ behavior.\n   For example, recently, enterprises and public safety organizations\n\
    \   have been subjected to telephony denial-of-service attacks [TDOS].\n   In\
    \ this case, an individual claiming to represent a collections\n   company for\
    \ payday loans starts the extortion scheme with a phone\n   call to an organization.\
    \  Failing to get payment from an individual\n   or organization, the criminal\
    \ organization launches a barrage of\n   phone calls with spoofed numbers, preventing\
    \ the targeted\n   organization from receiving legitimate phone calls.  Other\
    \ boiler-\n   room organizations use number spoofing to place illegal \"robocalls\"\
    \n   (automated telemarketing; see, for example, the US Federal\n   Communications\
    \ Commission webpage on this topic [ROBOCALL-FCC]).\n   Robocalls are a problem\
    \ that has been recognized already by various\n   regulators; for example, the\
    \ US Federal Trade Commission (FTC)\n   recently organized a robocall competition\
    \ to solicit ideas for\n   creating solutions that will block illegal robocalls\n\
    \   [ROBOCALL-CHALLENGE].  Criminals may also use number spoofing to\n   impersonate\
    \ banks or bank customers to gain access to information or\n   financial accounts.\n\
    \   In general, number spoofing is used in two ways: impersonation and\n   anonymization.\
    \  For impersonation, the attacker pretends to be a\n   specific individual. \
    \ Impersonation can be used for pretexting, where\n   the attacker obtains information\
    \ about the individual impersonated\n   and, for example, activates credit cards,\
    \ or for harassment, e.g.,\n   causing utility services to be disconnected, take-out\
    \ food to be\n   delivered, or police to respond to a non-existing hostage situation\n\
    \   (\"swatting\"; see [SWATTING]).  Some voicemail systems can be set up\n  \
    \ so that they grant access to stored messages without a password,\n   relying\
    \ solely on the caller identity.  As an example, in the News\n   International\
    \ phone-hacking scandal [NEWS-HACK], employees of the\n   newspaper were accused\
    \ of engaging in phone hacking by utilizing\n   Caller ID spoofing to get access\
    \ to voicemail.  For numbers where the\n   caller has suppressed textual caller\
    \ identification, number spoofing\n   can be used to retrieve this information,\
    \ stored in the so-called\n   Calling Name (CNAM) database.  For anonymization,\
    \ the caller does not\n   necessarily care whether the number is in service or\
    \ who it is\n   assigned to and may switch rapidly and possibly randomly between\n\
    \   numbers.  Anonymization facilitates automated illegal telemarketing\n   or\
    \ telephony denial-of-service attacks, as described above, as it\n   makes it\
    \ difficult to identify perpetrators and craft policies to\n   block them.  It\
    \ also makes tracing such calls much more labor-\n   intensive, as each call has\
    \ to be identified in each transit carrier\n   hop-by-hop, based on destination\
    \ number and time of call.\n   It is insufficient to simply outlaw all spoofing\
    \ of originating\n   telephone numbers because the entities spoofing numbers are\
    \ already\n   committing other crimes and are thus unlikely to be deterred by\
    \ legal\n   sanctions.  Secure origin identification should prevent impersonation\n\
    \   and, to a lesser extent, anonymization.  However, if numbers are easy\n  \
    \ and cheap to obtain, and if the organizations assigning identifiers\n   cannot\
    \ or will not establish the true corporate or individual\n   identity of the entity\
    \ requesting such identifiers, robocallers will\n   still be able to switch between\
    \ many different identities.\n   The problem space is further complicated by a\
    \ number of use cases\n   where entities in the telephone network legitimately\
    \ send calls on\n   behalf of others, including \"Find-Me/Follow-Me\" services.\n\
    \   Ultimately, any SIP entity can receive an INVITE request and forward\n   it\
    \ to any other entity, and the recipient of a forwarded message has\n   little\
    \ means to ascertain which recipient a call should legitimately\n   target (see\
    \ [SIP-SECURITY]).  Also, in some cases, third parties may\n   need to temporarily\
    \ use the identity of another individual or\n   organization with full consent\
    \ of the \"owner\" of the identifier.  For\n   example:\n   Doctors' offices:\
    \  Physicians calling their patients using their cell\n      phones would like\
    \ to replace their mobile phone number with the\n      number of their office\
    \ to avoid being called back by patients on\n      their personal phone.\n   Call\
    \ centers:  Call centers operate on behalf of companies, and the\n      called\
    \ party expects to see the Caller ID of the company, not the\n      call center.\n"
- title: 3.  Terminology
  contents:
  - "3.  Terminology\n   The following terms are defined in this document:\n   In-band\
    \ Identity Conveyance:  In-band conveyance is the presence of\n      call origin\
    \ identification information conveyed within the control\n      plane protocol(s)\
    \ setting up a call.  Any in-band solution must\n      accommodate in-band intermediaries\
    \ such as Back-to-Back User\n      Agents (B2BUAs).\n   Out-of-Band Identity Verification:\
    \  Out-of-band verification\n      determines whether the telephone number used\
    \ by the calling party\n      actually exists, whether the calling entity is entitled\
    \ to use the\n      number, and whether a call has recently been made from this\
    \ phone\n      number.  This approach is needed because the in-band technique\n\
    \      does not work in all cases, as when certain intermediaries are\n      involved\
    \ or due to interworking with circuit-switched networks.\n   Authority Delegation\
    \ Infrastructure:  The delegation authority\n      infrastructure determines how\
    \ the authority over telephone numbers\n      is used when numbers are ported\
    \ and delegated.  It also describes\n      how the existing numbering infrastructure\
    \ is reused to maintain\n      the lifecycle of number assignments.\n   Canonical\
    \ Telephone Number:  In order for either in-band conveyance\n      or out-of-band\
    \ verification to work, entities must be able to\n      canonicalize telephone\
    \ numbers to arrive at a common syntactical\n      form.\n"

    \ we\n   will explain some of the scenarios that need to be supported by any\n\
    \   solution.  To reduce clutter, the figures do not show call-routing\n   elements\
    \ such as SIP proxies of voice or text service providers.  We\n   generally assume\

  - "5.  Limitations of Current Solutions\n   From the inception of SIP, the From\
    \ header field value has held an\n   arbitrary user-supplied identity, much like\
    \ the From header field\n   value of an SMTP email message.  During work on [RFC3261],\
    \ efforts\n   began to provide a secure origin for SIP requests as an extension\
    \ to\n   SIP.  The so-called \"short term\" solution, the P-Asserted-Identity\n\
    \   header described in [RFC3325], is deployed fairly widely, even though\n  \
    \ it is limited to closed trusted networks where end-user devices\n   cannot alter\
    \ or inspect SIP messages and offers no cryptographic\n   validation.  As P-Asserted-Identity\
    \ is used increasingly across\n   multiple networks, it cannot offer any protection\
    \ against identity\n   spoofing by intermediaries or entities that allow untrusted\
    \ entities\n   to set the P-Asserted-Identity information.  An overview of\n \
    \  addressing spam in SIP and an explanation of how it differs from\n   similar\
    \ problems with email appeared in [RFC5039].\n   Subsequent efforts to prevent\
    \ calling-origin identity spoofing in SIP\n   include the SIP Identity effort\
    \ (the \"long-term\" identity solution)\n   [RFC4474] and Verification Involving\
    \ PSTN Reachability (VIPR)\n   [VIPR-OVERVIEW].  SIP Identity attaches a new header\
    \ field to SIP\n   requests containing a signature over the From header field\
    \ value\n   combined with other message components to prevent replay attacks.\n\
    \   SIP Identity is meant to prevent both (a) SIP UAs from originating\n   calls\
    \ with spoofed From headers and (b) intermediaries, such as SIP\n   proxies, from\
    \ launching man-in-the-middle attacks by altering calls\n   as they pass through\
    \ the intermediaries.  The VIPR architecture\n   attacked a broader range of problems\
    \ relating to spam, routing, and\n   identity with a new infrastructure for managing\
    \ rendezvous and\n   security, which operated alongside of SIP deployments.\n\
    \   As we will describe in more detail below, both SIP Identity and VIPR\n   suffer\
    \ from serious limitations that have prevented their deployment\n   on a significant\
    \ scale, but they may still offer ideas and protocol\n   building blocks for a\
    \ solution.\n"
- title: 5.1.  P-Asserted-Identity
  contents:
  - "5.1.  P-Asserted-Identity\n   The P-Asserted-Identity header field of SIP [RFC3325]\
    \ provides a way\n   for trusted network entities to share with one another an\n\
    \   authoritative identifier for the originator of a call.  The value of\n   P-Asserted-Identity\
    \ cannot be populated by a user, though if a user\n   wants to suggest an identity\
    \ to the trusted network, a separate\n   header (P-Preferred-Identity) enables\
    \ them to do so.  The features of\n   the P-Asserted-Identity header evolved as\
    \ part of a broader effort to\n   reach parity with traditional telephone network\
    \ signaling mechanisms\n   for selectively sharing and restricting presentation\
    \ of the calling\n   party number at the user level while still allowing core\
    \ network\n   elements to know the identity of the user for abuse prevention and\n\
    \   accounting.\n   In order for P-Asserted-Identity to have these properties,\
    \ it\n   requires the existence of a trust domain as described in [RFC3324].\n\
    \   Any entity in the trust domain may add a P-Asserted-Identity header\n   to\
    \ a SIP message, and any entity in the trust domain may forward a\n   message\
    \ with a P-Asserted-Identity header to any other entity in the\n   trust domain.\
    \  If a trusted entity forwards a SIP request to an\n   untrusted entity, however,\
    \ the P-Asserted-Identity header must first\n   be removed; most end-user devices\
    \ are outside trust domains.  Sending\n   a P-Asserted-Identity request to an\
    \ untrusted entity could leak\n   potentially private information, such as the\
    \ network-asserted calling\n   party number in a case where a caller has requested\
    \ presentation\n   restriction.  This concept of a trust domain is modeled on\
    \ the\n   trusted network of devices that operate the traditional telephone\n\
    \   network.\n   P-Asserted-Identity has been very successful in telephone replacement\n\
    \   deployments of SIP.  It is an extremely simple in-band mechanism,\n   requiring\
    \ no cryptographic operations.  Since it is so reminiscent of\n   legacy mechanisms\
    \ in the traditional telephone network and interworks\n   so seamlessly with those\
    \ protocols, it has naturally been favored by\n   providers comfortable with these\
    \ operating principles.\n   In practice, a trust domain exhibits many of the same\
    \ merits and\n   flaws as the traditional telephone network when it comes to securing\n\
    \   a calling party number.  Any trusted entity may provide P-Asserted-\n   Identity,\
    \ and a recipient of a SIP message has no direct assurance of\n   who generated\
    \ the P-Asserted-Identity header field value: all trust\n   is transitive.  Trust\
    \ domains are dictated by business arrangements\n   more than by security standards;\
    \ thus, the level of assurance of\n   P-Asserted-Identity is only as good as the\
    \ least trustworthy member\n   of a trust domain.  Since the contents of P-Asserted-Identity\
    \ are not\n   intended for consumption by end users, end users must trust that\n\
    \   their service provider participates in an appropriate trust domain,\n   as\
    \ there will be no direct evidence of the trust domain in the SIP\n   signaling\
    \ that end-user devices receive.  Since the mechanism is so\n   closely modeled\
    \ on the traditional telephone network, it is unlikely\n   to provide a higher\
    \ level of security than that.\n   Since [RFC3325] was written, the whole notion\
    \ of \"P-\" headers\n   intended for use in private SIP domains has also been\
    \ deprecated (see\n   [RFC5727]) largely because of overwhelming evidence that\
    \ these\n   headers were being used outside of private contexts and leaking into\n\
    \   the public Internet.  It is unclear how many deployments that make\n   use\
    \ of P-Asserted-Identity in fact conform to the Spec(T)\n   requirements of [RFC3324].\n\
    \   P-Asserted-Identity also complicates the question of which URI should\n  \
    \ be presented to a user when a call is received.  Per [RFC3261], SIP\n   user\
    \ agents would render the contents of the From header field to a\n   user when\
    \ receiving an INVITE request, but what if the P-Asserted-\n   Identity contains\
    \ a more trustworthy URI, and presentation is not\n   restricted?  Subsequent\
    \ proposals have suggested additional header\n   fields to carry different forms\
    \ of identity related to the caller,\n   including billing identities.  As the\
    \ calling identities in a SIP\n   request proliferate, the question of how to\
    \ select one to render to\n   the end user becomes more difficult to answer.\n"
- title: 5.2.  SIP Identity
  contents:
  - "5.2.  SIP Identity\n   The SIP Identity mechanism [RFC4474] provides two header\
    \ fields for\n   securing identity information in SIP requests: the Identity and\n\
    \   Identity-Info header fields.  Architecturally, the SIP Identity\n   mechanism\
    \ assumes a classic \"SIP trapezoid\" deployment in which an\n   authentication\
    \ service, acting on behalf of the originator of a SIP\n   request, attaches identity\
    \ information to the request that provides\n   partial integrity protection; a\
    \ verification service acting on behalf\n   of the recipient validates the integrity\
    \ of the request when it is\n   received.\n   The Identity header field value\
    \ contains a signature over a hash of\n   selected elements of a SIP request,\
    \ including several header field\n   values (most significantly, the From header\
    \ field value) and the\n   entirety of the body of the request.  The set of header\
    \ field values\n   was chosen specifically to prevent cut-and-paste attacks; it\
    \ requires\n   the verification service to retain some state to guard against\n\
    \   replays.  The signature over the body of a request has different\n   properties\
    \ for different SIP methods, but all prevent tampering by\n   man-in-the-middle\
    \ attacks.  For a SIP MESSAGE request, for example,\n   the signature over the\
    \ body covers the actual message conveyed by the\n   request: it is pointless\
    \ to guarantee the source of a request if a\n   man in the middle can change the\
    \ content of the message, as in that\n   case the message content is created by\
    \ an attacker.  Similar threats\n   exist against the SIP NOTIFY method.  For\
    \ a SIP INVITE request, a\n   signature over the Session Description Protocol\
    \ (SDP) body is\n   intended to prevent a man in the middle from changing properties\
    \ of\n   the media stream, including the IP address and port to which media\n\
    \   should be sent, as this provides a means for the man in the middle to\n  \
    \ direct session media to a resource that the originator did not\n   specify and\
    \ thus impersonate an intended listener.\n   The Identity-Info header field value\
    \ contains a URI designating the\n   location of the certificate corresponding\
    \ to the private key that\n   signed the hash in the Identity header.  That certificate\
    \ could be\n   passed by-value along with the SIP request, in which case a cid\
    \ URI\n   appears in Identity-Info, or by-reference, for example, when the\n \
    \  Identity-Info header field value has the URL of a service that\n   delivers\
    \ the certificate.  [RFC4474] imposes further constraints\n   governing the subject\
    \ of that certificate, namely, that it must cover\n   the domain name indicated\
    \ in the domain component of the URI in the\n   From header field value of the\
    \ request.\n   The SIP Identity mechanism, however, has two fundamental limitations\n\
    \   that have precluded its deployment: first, it provides identity only\n   for\
    \ domain names rather than other identifiers, and second, it does\n   not tolerate\
    \ intermediaries that alter the bodies, or certain header\n   fields, of SIP requests.\n\
    \   As deployed, SIP predominantly mimics the structures of the telephone\n  \
    \ network and thus uses telephone numbers as identifiers.  Telephone\n   numbers\
    \ in the From header field value of a SIP request may appear as\n   the user part\
    \ of a SIP URI or, alternatively, in an independent tel\n   URI.  The certificate\
    \ designated by the Identity-Info header field as\n   specified, however, corresponds\
    \ only to the domain portion of a SIP\n   URI in the From header field.  As such,\
    \ [RFC4474] does not have any\n   provision to identify the assignee of a telephone\
    \ number.  While it\n   could be the case that the domain name portion of a SIP\
    \ URI signifies\n   a carrier (like \"att.com\") to whom numbers are assigned,\
    \ the SIP\n   Identity mechanism provides no assurance that a particular number\
    \ has\n   been assigned to any specific carrier.  For a tel URI, moreover, it\n\
    \   is unclear in [RFC4474] what entity should hold a corresponding\n   certificate.\
    \  A caller may not want to reveal the identity of its\n   service provider to\
    \ the callee and may thus prefer tel URIs in the\n   From header field.\n   This\
    \ lack of authority gives rise to a whole class of SIP Identity\n   problems when\
    \ dealing with telephone numbers, as is explored in\n   [CONCERNS].  That document\
    \ shows how the Identity header of a SIP\n   request targeting a telephone number\
    \ (embedded in a SIP URI) could be\n   dropped by an intermediate domain, which\
    \ then modifies and re-signs\n   the request, all without alerting the verification\
    \ service: the\n   verification service has no way of knowing which original domain\n\
    \   signed the request.  Provided that the local authentication service\n   is\
    \ complicit, an originator can claim virtually any telephone number,\n   impersonating\
    \ any chosen Caller ID from the perspective of the\n   verifier.  Both of these\
    \ attacks are rooted in the inability of the\n   verification service to ascertain\
    \ a specific certificate that is\n   authoritative for a telephone number.\n \
    \  Moreover, as deployed, SIP is highly mediated and is mediated in ways\n   that\
    \ [RFC3261] did not anticipate.  As request routing commonly\n   depends on policies\
    \ dissimilar to [RFC3263], requests transit\n   multiple intermediate domains\
    \ to reach a destination; some forms of\n   intermediaries in those domains may\
    \ effectively reinitiate the\n   session.\n   One of the main reasons that SIP\
    \ deployments mimic the PSTN\n   architecture is because the requirement for interconnection\
    \ with the\n   PSTN remains paramount: a call may originate in SIP and terminate\
    \ on\n   the PSTN, or vice versa.  Worse still, a PSTN-to-PSTN call may\n   transit\
    \ a SIP network in the middle, or vice versa.  This necessarily\n   reduces SIP's\
    \ feature set to the least common denominator of the\n   telephone network and\
    \ mandates support for telephone numbers as a\n   primary calling identifier.\n\
    \   Interworking with non-SIP networks makes end-to-end identity\n   problematic.\
    \  When a PSTN gateway sends a call to a SIP network, it\n   creates the INVITE\
    \ request anew, regardless of whether a previous leg\n   of the call originated\
    \ in a SIP network that later delivered the call\n   to the PSTN.  As these gateways\
    \ are not necessarily operated by\n   entities that have any relationship to the\
    \ number assignee, it is\n   unclear how they could provide an identity signature\
    \ that a verifier\n   should trust.  Moreover, how could the gateway know that\
    \ the calling\n   party number it receives from the PSTN is actually authentic?\
    \  And\n   when a gateway receives a call via SIP and terminates a call to the\n\
    \   PSTN, how can that gateway verify that a telephone number in the From\n  \
    \ header field value is authentic before it presents that number as the\n   calling\
    \ party number in the PSTN?\n   Similarly, some SIP networks deploy intermediaries\
    \ that act as back-\n   to-back user agents (B2BUAs), typically in order to provide\
    \ policy or\n   interworking functions at network boundaries (hence, the nickname\n\
    \   \"Session Border Controller\").  These functions range from topology\n   hiding,\
    \ to alterations necessary to interoperate successfully with\n   particular SIP\
    \ implementations, to simple network address translation\n   from private address\
    \ space.  To implement these functions, these\n   entities modify SIP INVITE requests\
    \ in transit, potentially changing\n   the From, Contact, and Call-ID header field\
    \ values, as well as\n   aspects of the SDP, including especially the IP addresses\
    \ and ports\n   associated with media.  Consequently, a SIP request exiting a\
    \ B2BUA\n   does not necessarily bear much resemblance to the original request\n\
    \   received by the B2BUA, just as an SS7 request exiting a PSTN gateway\n   may\
    \ transform all aspects of the SIP request in the VoIP leg of the\n   call.  An\
    \ Identity signature provided for the original INVITE has no\n   bearing on the\
    \ post-B2BUA INVITE, and, were the B2BUA to preserve the\n   original Identity\
    \ header, any verification service would detect a\n   violation of the integrity\
    \ protection.\n   The SIP community has long been aware of these problems with\n\
    \   [RFC4474] in practical deployments.  Some have therefore proposed\n   weakening\
    \ the security constraints of [RFC4474] so that at least some\n   deployments\
    \ of B2BUAs will be compatible with integrity protection of\n   SIP requests.\
    \  However, such solutions do not address the key\n   problems identified above:\
    \ the lack of any clear authority for\n   telephone numbers and the fact that\
    \ some INVITE requests are\n   generated by intermediaries rather than endpoints.\
    \  Removing the\n   signature over the SDP from the Identity header will not,\
    \ for\n   example, make it any clearer how a PSTN gateway should assert\n   identity\
    \ in an INVITE request.\n"
- title: 5.3.  VIPR
  contents:
  - "5.3.  VIPR\n   Verification Involving PSTN Reachability (VIPR) directly attacks\
    \ the\n   twin problems of identifying number assignees on the Internet and\n\
    \   coping with intermediaries that may modify signaling.  To address the\n  \
    \ first problem, VIPR relies on the PSTN itself: it discovers which\n   endpoints\
    \ on the Internet are reachable via a particular PSTN number\n   by calling the\
    \ number on the PSTN to determine whom a call to that\n   number will reach. \
    \ As VIPR-enabled Internet endpoints associated\n   with PSTN numbers are discovered,\
    \ VIPR provides a rendezvous service\n   that allows the endpoints of a call to\
    \ form an out-of-band connection\n   over the Internet; this connection allows\
    \ the endpoints to exchange\n   information that secures future communications\
    \ and permits direct,\n   unmediated SIP connections.\n   VIPR provides these\
    \ services within a fairly narrow scope of\n   applicability.  Its seminal use\
    \ case is the enterprise IP Private\n   Branch Exchange (IPBX), a device that\
    \ has both PSTN connectivity and\n   Internet connectivity, which serves a set\
    \ of local users with\n   telephone numbers; after a PSTN call has connected successfully\
    \ and\n   then ended, the PBX searches a distributed hash table to see if any\n\
    \   VIPR-compatible devices have advertised themselves as a route for the\n  \
    \ unfamiliar number on the Internet.  If advertisements exist, the\n   originating\
    \ PBX then initiates a verification process to determine\n   whether the entity\
    \ claiming to be the assignee of the unfamiliar\n   number in fact received the\
    \ successful call: this involves verifying\n   details such as the start and stop\
    \ times of the call.  If the\n   destination verifies successfully, the originating\
    \ PBX provisions a\n   local database with a route for that telephone number to\
    \ the URI\n   provided by the proven destination.  Moreover, the destination gives\n\
    \   a token to the originator that can be inserted in future call setup\n   messages\
    \ to authenticate the source of future communications.\n   Through this mechanism,\
    \ the VIPR system provides a suite of\n   properties, ones that go well beyond\
    \ merely securing the origins of\n   communications.  It also provides a routing\
    \ system that dynamically\n   discovers mappings between telephone numbers and\
    \ URIs, effectively\n   building an ad hoc ENUM database in every VIPR implementation.\
    \  The\n   tokens exchanged over the out-of-band connection established by VIPR\n\
    \   also provide an authorization mechanism for accepting calls over the\n   Internet,\
    \ which significantly reduces the potential for spam.\n   Because the token can\
    \ act as a cookie due to the presence of this\n   out-of-band connectivity, the\
    \ VIPR token is less susceptible to cut-\n   and-paste attacks and thus needs\
    \ to cover far less of a SIP request\n   with its signature.\n   Due to its narrow\
    \ scope of applicability and the details of its\n   implementation, VIPR has some\
    \ significant limitations.  The most\n   salient for the purposes of this document\
    \ is that it only has bearing\n   on repeated communications between entities:\
    \ it has no solution to\n   the classic \"robocall\" problem, where the target\
    \ typically receives a\n   call from a number that has never called before.  All\
    \ of VIPR's\n   strengths in establishing identity and spam prevention kick in\
    \ only\n   after an initial PSTN call has been completed and subsequent attempts\n\
    \   at communication begin.  Every VIPR-compliant entity, moreover,\n   maintains\
    \ its own stateful database of previous contacts and\n   authorizations, which\
    \ lends itself more to aggregators like IP PBXs\n   that may front for thousands\
    \ of users than to individual phones.\n   That database must be refreshed by periodic\
    \ PSTN calls to determine\n   that control over the number has not shifted to\
    \ some other entity;\n   figuring out when data has grown stale is one of the\
    \ challenges of\n   the architecture.  As VIPR requires compliant implementations\
    \ to\n   operate both a PSTN interface and an IP interface, it has little\n  \
    \ apparent applicability to ordinary desktop PCs or similar devices\n   with no\
    \ ability to place direct PSTN calls.\n   The distributed hash table (DHT) also\
    \ creates a new attack surface\n   for impersonation.  Attackers who want to pose\
    \ as the owners of\n   telephone numbers can advertise themselves as routes to\
    \ a number in\n   the hash table.  VIPR has no inherent restriction on the number\
    \ of\n   entities that may advertise themselves as routes for a number; thus,\n\
    \   an originator may find multiple advertisements for a number on the\n   DHT\
    \ even when an attack is not in progress.  Attackers may learn from\n   these\
    \ validation attempts which VIPR entities recently placed calls\n   to the target\
    \ number, even if they cannot impersonate the target\n   since they lack the PSTN\
    \ call detail information.  It may be that\n   this information is all the attacker\
    \ hopes to glean.  The fact that\n   advertisements and verifications are public\
    \ results from the public\n   nature of the DHT that VIPR creates.  The public\
    \ DHT prevents any\n   centralized control or attempts to impede communications,\
    \ but those\n   come at the cost of apparently unavoidable privacy losses.\n \
    \  Because of these limitations, VIPR, much like SIP Identity, has had\n   little\
    \ impact in the marketplace.  Ultimately, VIPR's utility as an\n   identity mechanism\
    \ is limited by its reliance on the PSTN, especially\n   its need for an initial\
    \ PSTN call to complete before any of VIPR's\n   benefits can be realized, and\
    \ by the drawbacks of the highly public\n   exchanges required to create the out-of-band\
    \ connection between VIPR\n   entities.  As such, there is no obvious solution\
    \ to providing secure\n   origin services for SIP on the Internet today.\n"

    \ there have been a number\n   of fundamental shifts in the communications marketplace.\
    \  The most\n   transformative has been the precipitous rise of mobile smartphones,\n\
    \   which are now arguably the dominant communications device in the\n   developed\
    \ world.  Smart phones have both a PSTN and an IP interface,\n   as well as SMS\
    \ and Multimedia Messaging Service (MMS) capabilities.\n   This suite of tools\
    \ suggests that some of the techniques proposed by\n   VIPR could be adapted to\
    \ the smartphone environment.  The installed\n   base of smartphones is, moreover,\
    \ highly upgradable and permits rapid\n   adoption of out-of-band rendezvous services\
    \ for smartphones that\n   bypass the PSTN.  Mobile messaging services that use\
    \ telephone\n   numbers as identities allow smartphone users to send text messages\
    \ to\n   one another over the Internet rather than over the PSTN.  Like VIPR,\n\
    \   such services create an out-of-band connection over the Internet\n   between\
    \ smartphones; unlike VIPR, the rendezvous service is provided\n   by a trusted\
    \ centralized database rather than by a DHT, and it is the\n   centralized database\
    \ that effectively verifies and asserts the\n   telephone number of the sender\
    \ of a message.  While such messaging\n   services are specific to the users of\
    \ the specific service, it seems\n   clear that similar databases could be provided\

    \ national authorities for telephone numbers\n   are migrating their provisioning\

- title: 6.7.  Relationship with Number Assignment and Management
  contents:
  - "6.7.  Relationship with Number Assignment and Management\n   Currently, telephone\
    \ numbers are typically managed in a loose\n   delegation hierarchy.  For example,\
    \ a national regulatory agency may\n   task a private, neutral entity with administering\
    \ numbering\n   resources, such as area codes, and a similar entity with assigning\n\
    \   number blocks to carriers and other authorized entities, who in turn\n   then\
    \ assign numbers to customers.  Resellers with looser regulatory\n   obligations\
    \ can complicate the picture, and in many cases, it is\n   difficult to distinguish\
    \ the roles of enterprises from carriers.  In\n   many countries, individual numbers\
    \ are portable between carriers, at\n   least within the same technology (e.g.,\
    \ wireline-to-wireline).\n   Separate databases manage the mapping of numbers\
    \ to switch\n   identifiers, companies, and textual Caller ID information.\n \
    \  As the PSTN transitions to using VoIP technologies, new assignment\n   policies\
    \ and management mechanisms are likely to emerge.  For\n   example, it has been\
    \ proposed that geography could play a smaller\n   role in number assignments,\
    \ that individual numbers could be assigned\n   to end users directly rather than\
    \ only to service providers, and that\n   the assignment of numbers does not have\
    \ to depend on providing actual\n   call delivery services.\n   Databases today\
    \ already map telephone numbers to entities that have\n   been assigned the number,\
    \ e.g., through the LERG (Local Exchange\n   Routing Guide) in the United States.\
    \  Thus, the transition to IP-\n   based networks may offer an opportunity to\
    \ integrate cryptographic\n   bindings between numbers or number ranges and service\
