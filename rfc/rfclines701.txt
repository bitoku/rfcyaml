THIS IS THE FIRST OF WHAT ARE PLANNED TO BE MONTHLY REPORTS ON THE STATUS OF THE NEW PROTOCOL TELNET IMPLEMENTAIONS
HOSTS ON THE ARPA NETWORK.
INCLUDED IN THIS REPORT ARE DATA ONLY ON SERVER TELNETS AT THE VARIOUS SITES.
ONE WOULD HOPE THAT ANY SITE WITH AN OPERATIONAL NEW PROTOCOL SERVER TELNET WOULD ALSO BOAST A NEW PROTOCOL USER TELNET; WE CAN CERTAINLY ASSUME THIS FOR TENEX SITES AT WHICH TENEX 1.32 IS OPERATING.
HOWEVER, NO FURTHER CLAIMS ARE MADE FOR THE SERVER DATA CONTAINED IN THIS REPORT.
I AM SORRY TO REPORT
AT THIS LATE DATE, A MONTH AFTER THE RELEASE OF TENEX 1.32, LESS THAN ONE THIRD OF THE SERVER SITES HAVE ANY NEW  PROTOCOL SERVER OPERATING, ACCORDING TO MY SURVEYS , AND ONLY HALF OF THOSE ARE USING CORRECTLY THE LOGGER SOCKET CONVENTIONS,
AT THE END OF THIS REPORT
IS A COMPLETE TABULATION COMPILED FROM MY SURVEYS;
THE FOLLOWING IS A SUMMARY:
NO NEW PROT SERVER		19	 59% TOTAL NEW PROT IMPLEM.
NEW PROT ON SOCKET 27, OLD ON SOCKET 1 (2)		 5	 16% NEW PROT
(3)	 4	 13% NEW PROT
ALL DATA IN THIS REPORT
RUN AT VARIOUS TIMES, PLUS A FEW MANUAL CHECKS TO FILL OUT THE DATA.
WHAT IS REPORTED HERE IS THE WAY
THE VARIOUS SERVERS WORK AS SEEN BY THE NEW PROTOCOL USER TELNET
AT BBNA, AS OF 15 AUG.
THERE MAY BE DISCREPANCIES BETWEEN THESE RESULTS AND THOSE FROM SURVEYS
(1) NUMEROUS ATTEMPTS TO CONNECT TO THESE SITES
ALL FAILED DUE TO THE SITES' BEING DOWN TO THE NETWORK.
(2) THESE ARE THE SITES
WHOSE OPERATION IS 100% CORRECT
ACCORDING TO ALL PROTOCOLS AND CONVENTIONS, AS I UNDERSTAND THEM.
(3) WE REALIZE THAT SOME OF THE SERVERS

THERE APPEARS TO BE A MINOR BUG IN SU AI'S SERVER:
IT SEEMS TO SEND AN IMPROPER RESPONSE TO A REQUEST FOR OPTION O.
