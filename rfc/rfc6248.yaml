- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   The IP Performance Metrics (IPPM) framework [RFC2330] describes\n\
    \   several ways to record options and metric parameter settings, in\n   order\
    \ to account for sources of measurement variability.  For\n   example, Section\
    \ 13 of [RFC2330] describes the notion of \"Type P\" so\n   that metrics can be\
    \ specified in general, but the specifics (such as\n   payload length in octets\
    \ and protocol type) can replace P to\n   disambiguate the results.\n   When the\
    \ IPPM Metrics Registry [RFC4148] was designed, the\n   variability of the \"\
    Type P\" notion, and the variability possible with\n   the many metric parameters\
    \ (see Section 4.2 of [RFC2679]), were not\n   fully appreciated.  Further, some\
    \ of the early metric definitions\n   only indicate Poisson streams [RFC2330]\
    \ (see the metrics in\n   [RFC2679], [RFC2680], and [RFC3393]), but later work\
    \ standardized the\n   methods for Periodic Stream measurements [RFC3432], adding\
    \ to the\n   variability possible when characterizing a metric exactly.\n   It\
    \ is not believed to be feasible or even useful to register every\n   possible\
    \ combination of Type P, metric parameters, and Stream\n   parameters using the\
    \ current structure of the IPPM Metrics Registry.\n   The IPPM Metrics Registry\
    \ is believed to have very few users, if any.\n   Evidence of this was provided\
    \ by the fact that one registry entry was\n   syntactically incorrect for months\
    \ after [RFC5644] was published.\n   The text \":=\" was used for the metrics\
    \ in that document instead of\n   \"::=\".  It took eight months before someone\
    \ offered that a parser\n   found the error.  Even the original registry author\
    \ agrees that the\n   current registry is not efficient, and has submitted a proposal\
    \ to\n   effectively create a new registry.\n   Despite apparent efforts to find\
    \ current or even future users, no one\n   responded to the call for interest\
    \ in the RFC 4148 registry during\n   the second half of 2010.  Therefore, the\
    \ IETF now declares the\n   registry Obsolete without any further reservations.\n\
    \   When a registry is designated Obsolete, it simply prevents the IANA\n   from\
    \ registering new objects, in this case new metrics.  So, even if\n   a registry\
    \ user was eventually found, they could continue to use the\n   current registry,\
    \ and its contents will continue to be available.\n   The most recently published\
    \ memo that added metrics to the registry\n   is [RFC6049].  This memo updates\
    \ all previous memos that registered\n   new metrics, including [RFC4737] and\
    \ [RFC5560], so that the\n   registry's Obsolete status will be evident.\n"

  contents:
  - "2.  Action to Reclassify RFC 4148 and the Corresponding IANA Registry as\n  \
    \  Obsolete\n   Due to the ambiguities between the current metrics registrations\
    \ and\n   the metrics used, and the apparent minimal adoption of the registry\n\
    \   in practice, it is required that:\n   o  the IETF reclassify [RFC4148] as\
    \ Obsolete.\n   o  the IANA withdraw the current IPPM Metrics Registry from further\n\
    \      updates and note that it too is Obsolete.\n   It is assumed that parties\
    \ who wish to establish a replacement\n   registry function will work to specify\
    \ such a registry.\n"
- title: 3.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "3.  Security Considerations\n   This memo and its recommendations have no known\
    \ impact on the\n   security of the Internet (especially if there is a zombie\
    \ apocalypse\n   on the day it is published; humans will have many more security\n\
    \   issues to worry about stemming from the rise of the un-dead).\n"
- title: 4.  IANA Considerations
  contents:
  - "4.  IANA Considerations\n   Metrics defined in the IETF have been typically registered\
    \ in the\n   IANA IPPM Metrics Registry as described in the initial version of\
    \ the\n   registry [RFC4148].  However, areas for improvement of this registry\n\
    \   have been identified, and the registry structure has to be revisited\n   when\
    \ there is working group consensus to do so.\n   The current consensus is to designate\
    \ the IPPM Metrics Registry,\n   originally described in [RFC4148], as Obsolete.\n\
    \   The DESCRIPTION of the registry MIB has been modified as follows, and\n  \
    \ the first two sentences should be included on any IANA-maintained web\n   page\
    \ describing this registry or its contents:\n   DESCRIPTION\n      \"With the\
    \ approval and publication of RFC 6248, this module is\n      designated Obsolete.\n\
    \      The registry will no longer be updated, and the current contents\n    \
    \  will be maintained as-is on the day that RFC 6248 was published.\n      The\
    \ original Description text follows below:\n      This module defines a registry\
    \ for IP Performance Metrics.\n      ... \"\n"
