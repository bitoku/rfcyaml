  - "1.  Introduction\n   This document gives some observations on the role of simple\
    \ best-\n   effort traffic in the Internet.  For the purposes of this document,\n\
    \   we define \"simple best-effort traffic\" as traffic that does not\n   *rely*\
    \ on the *differential treatment* of flows either in routers or\n   in policers,\
    \ enforcers, or other middleboxes along the path and that\n   does not use admissions\
    \ control.  We define the term \"simple best-\n   effort traffic\" to avoid unproductive\
    \ semantic discussions about what\n   the phrase \"best-effort traffic\" does\
    \ or does not include.  We note\n   that our definition of \"simple best-effort\
    \ traffic\" includes traffic\n   that is not necessarily \"simple\", including\
    \ mechanisms common in the\n   current Internet such as pairwise agreements between\
    \ ISPs, volume-\n   based pricing, firewalls, and a wide range of mechanisms in\n\
    \   middleboxes.\n   \"Simple best-effort traffic\" in the current Internet uses\
    \ end-to-end\n   transport protocols (e.g., TCP, UDP, or others), with minimal\n\
    \   requirements of the network in terms of resource allocation.\n   However,\
    \ other implementations of simple best-effort service would be\n   possible, including\
    \ those that would rely on Fair Queueing or some\n   other form of per-flow scheduling\
    \ in congested routers.  Our\n   intention is to define \"simple best-effort traffic\"\
    \ to include the\n   dominant traffic class in the current Internet.\n   In contrast\
    \ to \"simple best-effort traffic\", intserv- or diffserv-\n   enabled traffic\
    \ relies on differential scheduling mechanisms at\n   congested routers, with\
    \ packets from different intserv or diffserv\n   classes receiving different treatment.\
    \  Similarly, in contrast to\n   \"simple best-effort traffic\", cost-based fairness\
    \ [B07] would most\n   likely require the deployment of traffic marking (e.g.,\
    \ Explicit\n   Congestion Notification (ECN)) at congested routers, along with\n\
    \   policing mechanisms near the two ends of the connection providing\n   differential\
    \ treatment for packets in different flows or in different\n   traffic classes.\
    \  Intserv/diffserv, cost-based fairness, and\n   congestion-based pricing could\
    \ also require more complex pairwise\n   economic relationships among Internet\
    \ Service Providers (ISPs), and\n   between end-users and ISPs.\n   This document\
    \ suggests that it is important to retain the class of\n   \"simple best-effort\
    \ traffic\" (though hopefully augmented by a wider\n   deployment of other classes\
    \ of service).  Further, this document\n   suggests that some form of rough flow-rate\
    \ fairness is an appropriate\n   goal for simple best-effort traffic.  We do not\
    \ argue in this\n   document that flow-rate fairness is the *only possible* or\
    \ *only\n   desirable* resource allocation goal for simple best-effort traffic.\n\
    \   We maintain, however, that it is an appropriate resource allocation\n   goal\
    \ for simple best-effort traffic in the current Internet, evolving\n   from the\
    \ Internet's past of end-point congestion control.\n   This document was motivated\
    \ by [B07], a paper titled \"Flow Rate\n   Fairness:  Dismantling a Religion\"\
    \ that asserts in the abstract that\n   \"comparing flow rates should never again\
    \ be used for claims of\n   fairness in production networks.\"  This document\
    \ does not attempt to\n   be a rebuttal to [B07], or to answer any or all of the\
    \ issues raised\n   in [B07], or to give the \"intellectual heritage\" for flow-based\n\
    \   fairness in philosophy or social science, or to commit the authors of\n  \
    \ this document to an extended dialogue with the author of [B07].  This\n   document\
    \ is simply a separate viewpoint on some related topics.\n"

  - "2.  On Simple Best-Effort Traffic\n   This section makes some observations on\
    \ the usefulness and\n   limitations of the class of simple best-effort traffic,\
    \ in comparison\n   with traffic receiving differential treatment.\n"
- title: 2.1.  The Usefulness of Simple Best-Effort Traffic
  contents:
  - "2.1.  The Usefulness of Simple Best-Effort Traffic\n   We now list some useful\
    \ aspects of simple best-effort traffic.\n   Minimal technical demands on the\
    \ network infrastructure:\n      Simple best-effort traffic, as implemented in\
    \ the current\n      Internet, makes minimal technical demands on the infrastructure.\n\
    \      There are no technical requirements for scheduling, queue\n      management,\
    \ or enforcement mechanisms in routers.\n   Minimal demands in terms of economic\
    \ infrastructure:\n      Simple best-effort traffic makes minimal demands in terms\
    \ of\n      economic infrastructure, relying on fairly simple pair-wise\n    \
    \  economic relationships among ISPs, and between a user and its\n      immediate\
    \ ISP.  In contrast, Section 4 discusses some of the\n      difficulties in the\
    \ incremental deployment of infrastructure for\n      additional classes of service.\n\
    \   Usefulness in the real world:\n      Simple best-effort traffic has been shown\
    \ to work in the Internet\n      for the past 20 years, however imperfectly. \
    \ Simple best-effort\n      traffic has supported everything from simple file\
    \ and e-mail\n      transfer and web traffic to video and audio streaming and\
    \ voice\n      communications.\n      As discussed below, simple best-effort traffic\
    \ is not optimal.\n      However, experience in the Internet has shown that there\
    \ has been\n      significant value in the mechanism of simple best-effort traffic,\n\
    \      generally allowing all users to get a portion of the resources\n      while\
    \ still preventing congestion collapse.\n"

  - "2.2.  The Limitations of Simple Best-Effort Traffic\n   We now discuss some limitations\
    \ of simple best-effort traffic.\n"
- title: 2.2.1.  Quality of Service (QoS)
  contents:
  - "2.2.1.  Quality of Service (QoS)\n   Some users would be happy to pay for more\
    \ bandwidth, less delay, less\n   jitter, or fewer packet drops.  It is desirable\
    \ to accommodate such\n   goals within the Internet architecture while preserving\
    \ a sufficient\n   amount of bandwidth for simple best-effort traffic.\n   One\
    \ of the obvious dangers of simple differential traffic treatment\n   implementations\
    \ that do not take steps to protect simple best-effort\n   traffic would be that\
    \ the users with more money *could* starve users\n   with less money in times\
    \ of congestion.  There seems to be fairly\n   widespread agreement that this\
    \ would not be a desirable goal.  As a\n   sample of the range of positions, the\
    \ Internet Society's Internet\n   2020 Initiative, titled \"The Internet is (still)\
    \ for Everyone\",\n   states that \"we remain committed to the openness that ensures\
    \ equal\n   access and full participation for every user\" [Internet2020].\n \
    \  The wide-ranging discussion of \"network neutrality\" in the United\n   States\
    \ includes advocates of several positions, including that of\n   \"absolute non-discrimination\"\
    \ (with no QoS considerations), \"limited\n   discrimination without QoS tiering\"\
    \ (no fees charged for higher-\n   quality service), and \"limited discrimination\
    \ and tiering\" (including\n   higher fees allowed for QoS) [NetNeutral].  The\
    \ proponents of\n   \"network neutrality\" are opposed to charging based on content\
    \ (e.g.,\n   based on applications or the content provider).\n   As the \"network\
    \ neutrality\" discussion makes clear, there are many\n   voices in the discussion\
    \ that would disagree with a resource\n   allocation goal of maximizing the combined\
    \ aggregate utility\n   (advocated in [B07a]), particularly where a user's utility\
    \ is\n   measured by the user's willingness to pay.  \"You get what you pay\n\
    \   for\" ([B07], page 5) does not appear to be the consensus goal for\n   resource\
    \ allocation in the community or in the commercial or\n   political realms of\
    \ the Internet.  However, there is a reasonable\n   agreement that higher-priced\
    \ services, as an adjunct to simple best-\n   effort traffic, can play an important\
    \ role in helping to finance the\n   Internet infrastructure.\n   Briscoe argues\
    \ for cost-fairness [B07], so that senders are made\n   accountable for the congestion\
    \ they cause.  There are, of course,\n   differences of opinion about how well\
    \ cost-based fairness could be\n   enforced, and how well it fits the commercial\
    \ reality of the\n   Internet, with [B07] presenting an optimistic view.  Another\
    \ point of\n   view, e.g., from an earlier paper by Roberts titled \"Internet\n\
    \   Traffic, QoS, and Pricing\", is that \"many proposed schemes are overly\n\
    \   concerned with congestion control to the detriment of the primary\n   pricing\
    \ function of return on investment\" [R04].\n   With *only* simple best-effort\
    \ traffic, there would be fundamental\n   limitations to the performance that\
    \ real-time applications could\n   deliver to users.  In addition to the obvious\
    \ needs for high\n   bandwidth, low delay or jitter, or low packet drop rates,\
    \ some\n   applications would like a fast start-up, or to be able to resume\n\
    \   their old high sending rate after a relatively long idle period, or\n   to\
    \ be able to rely on a call-setup procedure so that the application\n   is not\
    \ even started if network resources are not sufficient.  There\n   are severe\
    \ limitations to how effectively these requirements can be\n   accommodated by\
    \ simple best-effort service in a congested\n   environment.  Of course, Quality\
    \ of Service architectures for the\n   Internet have their own limitations and\
    \ difficulties, as discussed in\n   [RFC2990] and elsewhere.  We are not going\
    \ to discuss these\n   difficulties further here.\n"

- title: 3.  On Flow-Rate Fairness for Simple Best-Effort Traffic
  contents:
  - "3.  On Flow-Rate Fairness for Simple Best-Effort Traffic\n   This section argues\
    \ that rough flow-rate fairness is an acceptable\n   goal for simple best-effort\
    \ traffic.  We do not, however, claim that\n   flow-rate fairness is necessarily\
    \ an *optimal* fairness goal or\n   resource allocation mechanism for simple best-effort\
    \ traffic.  Simple\n   best-effort traffic and flow-rate fairness are in general\
    \ not about\n   optimality, but instead are about a low-overhead service (best-effort\n\
    \   traffic) along with a rough, simple fairness model (flow-rate\n   fairness).\n\
    \   Within simple best-effort traffic, it would be possible to have\n   explicit\
    \ fairness mechanisms that are implemented by the end-hosts in\n   the network\
    \ (as in proportional fairness or TCP fairness), explicit\n   fairness mechanisms\
    \ enforced by the routers (as in max-min fairness\n   with Fair Queueing), or\
    \ a traffic class with no explicit fairness\n   mechanisms at all (as in the Internet\
    \ before TCP congestion control).\n   This document does *not* address the issues\
    \ about the implementation\n   of flow-rate fairness.  In the current Internet,\
    \ rough flow-rate\n   fairness is achieved by the fact that *most* of the traffic\
    \ in the\n   Internet uses TCP, and *most* of the TCP connections in fact use\n\
    \   conformant TCP congestion control [MAF05].  However, rough flow-rate\n   fairness\
    \ could also be achieved by the use of per-flow scheduling at\n   congested routers\
    \ [DKS89] [LLSZ96], by related router mechanisms\n   [SSZ03], or by congestion-controlled\
    \ transport protocols other than\n   TCP.  This document does not address the\
    \ pros and cons of TCP-\n   friendly congestion control, equation-based congestion\
    \ control\n   [FHPW00], or any of the myriad of other issues concerning mechanisms\n\
    \   for approximating flow-rate fairness.  Le Boudec's tutorial on rate\n   adaption,\
    \ congestion control, and fairness gives an introduction to\n   some of these\
    \ issues [B00].\n"
- title: 3.1.  The Usefulness of Flow-Rate Fairness
  contents:
  - "3.1.  The Usefulness of Flow-Rate Fairness\n   We note that the limitations of\
    \ flow-rate fairness are many, with a\n   long history in the literature.  We\
    \ discuss these limitations in the\n   next section.  While the benefits of simple\
    \ best-effort traffic and\n   rough flow-rate fairness are rarely discussed, this\
    \ does *not* mean\n   that benefits do not exist.  In this section, we discuss\
    \ the benefits\n   of flow-rate fairness.  We note that many of the useful aspects\
    \ of\n   simple best-effort traffic discussed above also qualify as useful\n \
    \  aspects of rough flow-rate fairness.  For simple best-effort traffic\n   with\
    \ rough flow-rate fairness, the quote from Winston Churchill about\n   democracy\
    \ comes to mind: \"Democracy is the worst form of government\n   except all those\
    \ other forms that have been tried from time to time\"\n   [C47].\n   Minimal\
    \ technical demands on the network infrastructure:\n      First, the rough flow-rate\
    \ fairness for best-effort traffic\n      provided by TCP or other transport protocols\
    \ makes minimal\n      technical demands on the infrastructure, as TCP's congestion\n\
    \      control algorithms are wholly implemented in the end-hosts.\n      However,\
    \ mechanisms for *enforcement* of the flow-rate fairness\n      *would* require\

    \ infrastructure:\n      A system based on rough flow-rate fairness for simple\

    \      among ISPs or between users and ISPs.  In contrast, Section 4\n      discusses\
    \ some of the difficulties in the incremental deployment\n      of infrastructure\

- title: 3.2.1.  The Enforcement of Flow-Rate Fairness
  contents:
  - "3.2.1.  The Enforcement of Flow-Rate Fairness\n   One of the limitations of rough\
    \ flow-rate fairness is the difficulty\n   of enforcement.  One possibility for\
    \ implementing flow-rate fairness\n   would be an infrastructure designed from\
    \ the start with a requirement\n   for ubiquitous per-flow scheduling in routers.\
    \  However, when\n   starting with an infrastructure such as the current Internet\
    \ with\n   best-effort traffic largely served by First-In First-Out (FIFO)\n \
    \  scheduling in routers and a design preference for intelligence at the\n   ends,\
    \ enforcement of flow-rate fairness is difficult at best.\n   Further, a transition\
    \ to an infrastructure that provides actual\n   flow-rate fairness for best-effort\
    \ traffic enforced in routers would\n   be difficult.\n   A second possibility,\
    \ which is largely how the current Internet is\n   operated, would be simple best-effort\
    \ traffic where most of the\n   connections, packets, and bytes belong to connections\
    \ using similar\n   congestion-control mechanisms (in this case, those of TCP\
    \ congestion\n   control), with few if any enforcement mechanisms.  Of course,\
    \ when\n   this happens, the result is a rough approximation of flow-rate\n  \
    \ fairness, with no guarantees that the simple best-effort traffic will\n   continue\
    \ to be dominated by connections using similar congestion-\n   control mechanisms\
    \ or that users or applications cannot game the\n   system for their benefit.\
    \  That is our current state of affairs.  The\n   good news is that the current\
    \ Internet continues to successfully\n   carry traffic for many users.  In particular,\
    \ we are not aware of\n   reports of frequent congestion collapse, or of the Internet\
    \ being\n   dominated by severe congestion or intolerable unfairness.\n   A third\
    \ possibility would be simple best-effort traffic with flow-\n   rate fairness\
    \ provided by the congestion control mechanisms in the\n   transport protocols,\
    \ with some level of enforcement, either in\n   congested routers, in middleboxes,\
    \ or by other mechanisms [MBFIPS01]\n   [MF01] [SSZ03].  There seems to us to\
    \ be considerable promise that\n   incentives among the various players (ISPs,\
    \ vendors, customers,\n   standards bodies, political entities, etc.) will align\
    \ somewhat, and\n   that further progress will be made on the deployment of various\n\
    \   enforcement mechanisms for flow-rate fairness for simple best-effort\n   traffic.\
    \  Of course, this is not likely to turn in to a fully\n   reliable and ubiquitous\
    \ enforcement of flow-rate fairness, or of any\n   related fairness goals, for\
    \ simple best-effort traffic, so this is\n   not likely to be satisfactory to\
    \ purists in this area.  However, it\n   may be enough to continue to encourage\
    \ most systems to use standard\n   congestion control.\n"
- title: 3.2.2.  The Precise Definition of Flow-Based Fairness
  contents:
  - "3.2.2.  The Precise Definition of Flow-Based Fairness\n   A second limitation\
    \ of flow-based fairness is that there is seemingly\n   no consensus within the\
    \ research, standards, or technical communities\n   about the precise form of\
    \ flow-based fairness that should be desired\n   for simple best-effort traffic.\
    \  This area is very much still in\n   flux, as applications, transport protocols,\
    \ and the Internet\n   infrastructure evolve.\n   Some of the areas where there\
    \ is a range of opinions about the\n   desired goals for rough flow-based fairness\
    \ for simple best-effort\n   traffic include the following:\n   *  Granularity:\
    \ What is the appropriate fairness granularity?  That\n      is, for flow-based\
    \ fairness, what is the definition of a 'flow'?\n      (This question has been\
    \ explicitly posed in [RFC2309], [RFC2914],\n      and many other places.)  Should\
    \ fairness be assessed on a per-\n      connection basis?  Should fairness take\
    \ into account multiple\n      connections between a pair of end-hosts (e.g.,\
    \ as suggested by\n      [RFC3124])?  If congestion control applies to each individual\n\
    \      connection, what controls (if any) should constrain the number of\n   \
    \   connections opened between a pair of end-hosts?  As an example,\n      RFC\
    \ 2616 specifies that with HTTP 1.1, a single-user client SHOULD\n      NOT maintain\
    \ more than two persistent connections with any server\n      or proxy [RFC2616]\
    \ (Section 8.1.4).  For peer-to-peer traffic,\n      different operating systems\
    \ have different limitations on the\n      maximum number of peer-to-peer connections;\
    \ Windows XP Pro has a\n      limit of ten simultaneous peer-to-peer connections,\
    \ Windows XP\n      Home (for the client) has a limit of five, and an OS X client\
    \ has\n      a limit of ten [P2P].\n   *  RTT fairness: What is the desired relationship\
    \ between flow\n      bandwidth and round-trip times, for simple best-effort traffic?\n\
    \      As shown in Section 3.3 of [FJ92], it would be straightforward to\n   \
    \   modify TCP's congestion control algorithms so that flows with\n      similar\
    \ packet drop rates but different round-trip times would\n      receive roughly\
    \ the same throughput.  This question is further\n      studied in [HSMK98]. \
    \ It remains an open question what would be\n      the desired relationship between\
    \ throughput and round-trip times\n      for simple best-effort traffic, particularly\
    \ for applications or\n      transport protocols using some form of feedback-based\
    \ congestion\n      control.\n   *  Multiple congested routers: What is the desired\
    \ relationship\n      between flow bandwidth and the number of congested routers\
    \ along\n      the path, for simple best-effort traffic?  It is well established\n\
    \      that for TCP traffic in particular, flows that traverse multiple\n    \
    \  congested routers receive a higher packet drop rate, and therefore\n      lower\
    \ throughput, than flows with the same round-trip time that\n      traverse only\
    \ one congested router [F91].  There is also a long-\n      standing debate between\
    \ max-min fairness [HG86] and proportional\n      fairness [KMT98], and no consensus\
    \ within the research community\n      on the desired fairness goals in this area.\n\
    \   *  Bursty vs. smooth traffic: What is the desired relationship\n      between\
    \ flow bandwidth and the burstiness in the sending rate of\n      the flow?  Is\
    \ it a goal for a bursty flow to receive the same\n      average or maximum bandwidth\
    \ as a flow with a smooth sending rate?\n      How does the goal depend on the\
    \ time scale of the burstiness of\n      the flow [K96]?  For instance, a flow\
    \ that is bursty on time\n      scales of less than a round-trip time has different\
    \ dynamics than\n      a flow that is bursty on a time scale of seconds or minutes.\n\
    \   *  Packets or bytes: Should the rough fairness goals be in terms of\n    \
    \  packets per second or bytes per second [RFC3714]?  And if the\n      fairness\
    \ goals are in terms of bytes per second, does this include\n      the bandwidth\
    \ used by packet headers (e.g., TCP and IP headers)?\n   *  Different transport\
    \ protocols: Should the transport protocol used\n      (e.g., UDP, TCP, SCTP,\
    \ DCCP) or the application affect the rough\n      fairness goals for simple best-effort\
    \ traffic?\n   *  Unicast vs. multicast: What should the fairness goals be between\n\
    \      unicast and multicast traffic [FD04] [ZOX05]?\n   *  Precision of fairness:\
    \  How precise should the fairness goals be?\n      Is the precision that is possible\
    \ from per-flow scheduling the\n      right benchmark?  Or, is a better touchstone\
    \ the rough fairness\n      over multiple round-trip times achieved by TCP flows\
    \ over FIFO\n      scheduling?  Or, is a goal of even more rough fairness of an\
    \ order\n      of magnitude or more between flows using different transport\n\
    \      protocols right?\n      There is a range of literature for each of these\
    \ topics, and we\n      have not attempted to cite it all above.  Rough flow-based\n\
    \      fairness for simple best-effort traffic could evolve with a range\n   \
    \   of possibilities for fairness in terms of round-trip times, the\n      number\
    \ of congested routers, packet size, or the number of\n      receivers per flow.\
    \  (Further discussion can be found in\n      [RFC5166].)\n   Fairness over time:\n\
    \      One issue raised in [B07] concerns how fairness should be\n      integrated\
    \ over time.  For example, for simple best-effort\n      traffic, should long\
    \ flows receive less bandwidth in bits per\n      second than short flows?  For\
    \ cost-based fairness or for QoS-based\n      traffic, it seems perfectly viable\
    \ for there to be some scenarios\n      where the cost is a function of flow or\
    \ session lifetime.  It also\n      seems viable for there to be some scenarios\
    \ where the cost of\n      QoS-enabled traffic is independent of flow or session\
    \ lifetime\n      (e.g., for a private Intranet that is measured only by the\n\
    \      bandwidth of the access link, but where any traffic sent on that\n    \
    \  Intranet is guaranteed to receive a certain QoS).\n      However, for simple\
    \ best-effort traffic, the current form of rough\n      fairness seems acceptable,\
    \ with fairness that is independent of\n      session length.  That is, in the\
    \ current Internet, a user who\n      opens a single TCP connection for ten hours\
    \ *might* receive the\n      same average throughput in bits per second, during\
    \ that TCP\n      connection, as a user who opens a single TCP connection for\
    \ ten\n      minutes and then goes off-line.  Similarly, a user who is online\n\
    \      for ten hours each day *might* receive the same throughput in bits\n  \
    \    per second, and pay roughly the same cost, as a user who is online\n    \
    \  for ten minutes each day.  That seems acceptable to us.  Other\n      pricing\
    \ mechanisms between users and ISPs seem acceptable also.\n      The current Internet\
    \ includes a wide range of pricing mechanisms\n      between users and ISPs for\
    \ best-effort traffic.\n"

  - "4.  On the Difficulties of Incremental Deployment\n   One of the advantages of\
    \ simple best-effort service is that it is\n   currently operational in the Internet,\
    \ along with the rough flow-rate\n   fairness that results from the dominance\
    \ of TCP's congestion control.\n   While additional classes of service would clearly\
    \ be of use in the\n   Internet, the deployment difficulties of such mechanisms\
    \ have been\n   non-trivial [B03].  The problems of deploying interlocking changes\
    \ to\n   the infrastructure do not necessarily have an easy fix as they stem\n\
    \   in part from the underlying architecture of the Internet.  As\n   explained\
    \ in RFC 1958 titled \"Architectural Principles of the\n   Internet\":  \"Fortunately,\
    \ nobody owns the Internet, there is no\n   centralized control, and nobody can\
    \ turn it off\" [RFC1958].  Some of\n   the difficulties of making changes in\
    \ the Internet infrastructure,\n   including the difficulties imposed by the political\
    \ and economic\n   context, have been discussed elsewhere (e.g., [CMB07]).  The\n\
    \   difficulty of making changes to the Internet infrastructure is in\n   contrast\
    \ to the comparative ease in making changes in Internet\n   applications.\n  \
    \ The difficulties of deployment for end-to-end intserv or diffserv\n   mechanisms\
    \ are well-known, having in part to do with the difficulties\n   of deploying\
    \ the required economic infrastructure [B03].  It seems\n   likely that cost-based\
    \ schemes based on re-ECN could also have a\n   difficult deployment path, involving\
    \ the deployment of ECN-marking at\n   routers, policers at both ends of a connection,\
    \ and a change in\n   pairwise economic relationships to include a congestion\
    \ metric [B07].\n   Some infrastructure deployment problems are sufficiently difficult\n\
    \   that they have their own working groups in the IETF [MBONED].\n"

  - "5.1.  From the IETF\n   This section discusses IETF documents relating to simple\
    \ best-effort\n   service and flow-rate fairness.\n   RFC 896 on congestion control:\
    \ Nagle's RFC 896 titled \"Congestion\n   Control in IP/TCP\", from 1984, raises\
    \ the issue of congestion\n   collapse, and says that \"improved handling of congestion\
    \ is now\n   mandatory\" [RFC896].  RFC 896 was written in the context of a heavily\n\
    \   loaded network, the only private TCP/IP long-haul network in\n   existence\
    \ at the time (that of Ford Motor Company, in 1984).  In\n   addition to introducing\
    \ the Nagle algorithm for minimizing the\n   transmission of small packets in\
    \ TCP, RFC 896 considers the\n   effectiveness of ICMP Source Quench for congestion\
    \ control, and\n   comments that future gateways should be capable of defending\n\
    \   themselves against obnoxious or malicious hosts.  However, RFC 896\n   does\
    \ not raise the question of fairness between competing users or\n   flows.\n \
    \  RFC 2309 on unresponsive flows: RFC 2309, an Informational document\n   from\
    \ the End-to-End Research Group titled \"Recommendations on Queue\n   Management\
    \ and Congestion Avoidance in the Internet\" from 2000,\n   contains the following\
    \ recommendation: \"It is urgent to begin or\n   continue research, engineering,\
    \ and measurement efforts contributing\n   to the design of mechanisms to deal\
    \ with flows that are unresponsive\n   to congestion notification or are responsive\
    \ but more aggressive than\n   TCP\" [RFC2309].\n   RFC 2616 on opening multiple\
    \ connections: RFC 2616, the standards-\n   track document for HTTP/1.1, specifies\
    \ that \"clients that use\n   persistent connections SHOULD limit the number of\
    \ simultaneous\n   connections that they maintain to a given server\" (Section\
    \ 8.1.4 of\n   [RFC2616]).\n   RFC 2914 on congestion control principles: RFC\
    \ 2914, a Best Current\n   Practice document, from 2000 titled \"Congestion Control\
    \ Principles\",\n   discusses the issues of preventing congestion collapse, maintaining\n\
    \   some form of fairness for best-effort traffic, and optimizing a\n   flow's\
    \ performance in terms of throughput, delay, and loss for the\n   flow in question.\
    \  In the discussion of fairness, RFC 2914 outlines\n   policy issues concerning\
    \ the appropriate granularity of a \"flow\", and\n   acknowledges that end nodes\
    \ can easily open multiple concurrent flows\n   to the same destination.  RFC\
    \ 2914 also discusses open issues\n   concerning fairness between reliable unicast,\
    \ unreliable unicast,\n   reliable multicast, and unreliable multicast transport\
    \ protocols.\n   RFC 3714 on the amorphous problem of fairness: Section 3.3 of\
    \ RFC\n   3714, an Informational document from the IAB (Internet Architecture\n\
    \   Board) discussing congestion control for best-effort voice traffic,\n   has\
    \ a discussion of \"the amorphous problem of fairness\", discussing\n   complicating\
    \ issues of packet sizes, round-trip times, application-\n   level functionality,\
    \ and the like [RFC3714].\n   RFCs on QoS: There is a long history in the IETF\
    \ of the development\n   of QoS mechanisms for integrated and differentiated services\n\
    \   [RFC2212, RFC2475].  These include lower effort per-domain behaviors\n   that\
    \ could be used to protect best-effort traffic from lower-priority\n   traffic\
    \ [RFC3662].\n"

  - "5.2.  From Elsewhere\n   This section briefly mentions some of the many papers\
    \ in the\n   literature on best-effort traffic or on fairness for competing flows\n\
    \   or users.  [B07] also has a section on some of the literature\n   regarding\
    \ fairness in the Internet.\n   Fairness with AIMD: Fairness with AIMD (Additive\
    \ Increase\n   Multiplicative Decrease) congestion control was studied by Chiu\
    \ and\n   Jain in 1987, where fairness is maximized when each user or flow gets\n\
    \   equal allocations of the bottleneck bandwidth [CJ89].  Van Jacobson's\n  \
    \ 1988 paper titled \"Congestion Avoidance and Control\" defined TCP's\n   AIMD-based\
    \ congestion control mechanisms [J88].\n   Fair Queueing: The 1989 paper on Fair\
    \ Queueing by Demers et al.\n   promoted Fair Queueing scheduling at routers as\
    \ providing fair\n   allocation of bandwidth, lower delay for low-bandwidth traffic,\
    \ and\n   protection from ill-behaved sources [DKS89].\n   Congestion-based pricing:\
    \ One of the early papers on congestion-based\n   pricing in networks is the 1993\
    \ paper titled \"Pricing the Internet\"\n   by MacKie-Mason and Varian [MV93].\
    \  This paper proposed a \"Smart\n   Market\" to price congestion in real time,\
    \ with a per-packet charge\n   reflecting marginal congestion costs.  Frank Kelly's\
    \ web page at\n   [Proportional] has citations to papers on proportional fairness,\n\
    \   including [K97] titled \"Charging and Rate Control for Elastic\n   Traffic\"\
    .\n   Other papers on pricing in computer networks include [SCEH96], which\n \
    \  is in part a critique of some of the pricing proposals in the\n   literature\
    \ at the time.  [SCEH96] argues that usage charges must\n   remain at significant\
    \ levels even if congestion is extremely low.\n"
