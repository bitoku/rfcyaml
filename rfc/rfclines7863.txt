Abstract This document provides the External Data Representation (XDR) description for NFS version 4 minor version 2.
This document contains the External Data Representation (XDR)
[RFC4506] description of the NFSv4.2 protocol [RFC7862]. 1.1.
The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119
In order to facilitate implementations that support all of NFSv4.0, NFSv4.1, and NFSv4.2, the description includes operations and other features of NFSv4.0 and NFSv4.1 that do not apply to NFSv4.2.
This XDR specification is fully compatible with the specification for NFSv4.0 [RFC7531], with the exception of the clientaddr4 structure, which has been replaced by (strictly, aliased to) netaddr4, which has the same members with the same purposes but the names have changed:
na r netid, r addr   na r addr)
This effectively fully reconverges the NFSv4.0 [RFC7531] and NFSv4.1 [RFC5662] strands of the XDR.
The XDR description is provided in this document in a way that makes it simple for the reader to extract it into a form that is ready to compile.
That is, if the above script is stored in a file called "extract.sh" and this document is in a file called "spec.txt", then the reader can do: <CODE BEGINS> sh extract.sh < spec.txt > nfs4
The XDR description, with the sentinel sequence, follows: <
