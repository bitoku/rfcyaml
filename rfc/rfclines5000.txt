Internet Official Protocol Standards Status of This Memo
This memo provides information for the Internet community.
It does not specify an Internet standard of any kind.
Distribution of this memo is unlimited.
This document obsoletes RFC 3700.
It also reclassifies RFCs that were previously published as STD 1 as Historic.
More specifically, this RFC moves RFCs 3000, 3300, 3600, and 3700 to Historic status.
Abstract This document is published by the RFC Editor to provide a summary of the current standards protocols (as of 18 February 2008).
It lists those official protocol standards, Best Current Practice, and Experimental RFCs that have not been obsoleted; it is not a complete index to the RFC series.
Newly published RFCs and RFCs whose status has changed are starred.
For an up to date list, see
http://www.rfc editor.org/rfcxx00.html, which is updated daily.
This memo contains a snapshot of the state of standardization of protocols used in the Internet, as determined by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF).
It is a 18 February 2008 snapshot of the current official protocol standards list and the Best Current Practice list, which is updated daily and is available from the RFC Editor Web site.
The RFC Editor publishes Request for Comments (RFC) documents that are the output of 4 streams: IAB, IETF, IRTF, and Independent Submission via the RFC Editor.
This memo is published by the RFC Editor for the IESG and IAB, in which the categorizations are in accordance with Section 2.1 of "The Internet Standards Process   Revision 3", RFC 2026, which specifies the rules and procedures by which all Internet standards are set.
Sections 3.1 3.7 of this memo contain the lists of protocols in each stage of standardization Standard, Draft Standard, Proposed Standard, Experimental, as well as Best Current Practice documents.
Protocols that are new to this document or have been moved from one protocol level to another, or that differ from the previous edition of this document are marked with an asterisk.
Informational and Historic RFCs are not included.
This list is not a complete index to RFCs.
This list is a live document that is updated daily on the RFC Editor site at: http://www.rfc
editor.org/rfcxx00.html RFCs are available online via http and ftp as: http://www.rfc editor.org/rfc/rfcXXXX.txt ftp://ftp.rfc editor.org/in notes/rfcXXXX.txt where XXXX represents the corresponding RFC number.
The RFC Editor maintains the official repository of all RFCs and indexes to them.
The site also provides additional information about the history of the RFC Editor, current submission and review procedures, and editorial and publication procedures.
Please see the RFC Editor site for all other RFC related information:
