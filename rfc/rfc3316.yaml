  - "1 Introduction\n   Technologies such as GPRS (General Packet Radio Service),\
    \ UMTS\n   (Universal Mobile Telecommunications System) and CDMA2000 (Code\n \
    \  Division Multiple Access 2000) are making it possible for cellular\n   hosts\
    \ to have an always-on connection to the Internet.  IPv6 becomes\n   necessary,\
    \ as it is expected that the number of such cellular hosts\n   will increase rapidly.\
    \  Standardization organizations working with\n   cellular technologies have recognized\
    \ this and are making IPv6\n   mandatory in their specifications.\n   Support\
    \ for IPv6 and the introduction of UMTS starts with 3GPP\n   Release 99 networks\
    \ and hosts.  IPv6 is specified as the only IP\n   version supported for IP Multimedia\
    \ Subsystem (IMS) starting from\n   Release 5.\n"

  contents:
  - "1.1 Scope of this Document\n   For the purposes of this document, a cellular\
    \ interface is considered\n   to be the interface to a cellular access network\
    \ based on the\n   following standards: 3GPP GPRS and UMTS Release 99, Release\
    \ 4,\n   Release 5, as well as future UMTS releases.  A cellular host is\n   considered\
    \ to be a host with such a cellular interface.\n   This document lists IPv6 specifications\
    \ with discussion on the use of\n   these specifications when operating over cellular\
    \ interfaces.  Such a\n   specification is necessary in order for the optimal\
    \ use of IPv6 in a\n   cellular environment.  The description is made from a cellular\
    \ host\n   point of view.  Important considerations are given in order to\n  \
    \ eliminate unnecessary user confusion over configuration options,\n   ensure\
    \ interoperability and to provide an easy reference for those\n   implementing\
    \ IPv6 in a cellular host.  It is necessary to ensure that\n   cellular hosts\
    \ are good citizens of the Internet.\n   This document is informational in nature,\
    \ and it is not intended to\n   replace, update, or contradict any IPv6 standards\
    \ documents [RFC-\n   2026].\n   The main audience of this document are:  the\
    \ implementers of cellular\n   hosts that will be used with GPRS, 3GPP UMTS Release\
    \ 99, Release 4,\n   Release 5, or future releases of UMTS.  The document provides\n\
    \   guidance on which parts of IPv6 to implement in such cellular hosts.\n   Parts\
    \ of this document may also apply to other cellular link types,\n   but no such\
    \ detailed analysis has been done yet and is a topic of\n   future work.  This\
    \ document should not be used as a definitive list\n   of IPv6 functionality for\
    \ cellular links other than those listed\n   above.  Future changes in 3GPP networks\
    \ that require changes in host\n   implementations may result in updates to this\
    \ document.\n   There are different ways to implement cellular hosts:\n   - The\
    \ host can be a \"closed 2G or 3G host\" with a very compact size\n     and optimized\
    \ applications, with no possibility to add or download\n     applications that\
    \ can have IP communications.  An example of such a\n     host is a very simple\
    \ form of a mobile phone.\n   - The host can be an \"open 2G or 3G host\" with\
    \ a compact size, but\n     where it is possible to download applications; such\
    \ as a PDA-type\n     of phone.\n   If a cellular host has additional interfaces\
    \ on which IP is used,\n   (such as Ethernet, WLAN, Bluetooth, etc.) then there\
    \ may be\n   additional requirements for the device, beyond what is discussed\
    \ in\n   this document.  Additionally, this document does not make any\n   recommendations\
    \ on the functionality required on laptop computers\n   having a cellular interface\
    \ such as a PC card, other than\n   recommending link specific behavior on the\
    \ cellular link.\n   This document discusses IPv6 functionality as specified when\
    \ this\n   document has been written.  Ongoing work on IPv6 may affect what is\n\
    \   needed from future hosts.  The reader should also be advised other\n   relevant\
    \ work exists for various other layers.  Examples of this\n   include the header\
    \ compression work done in the IETF ROHC group, the\n   analysis of the effects\
    \ of error-prone links to performance in [RFC-\n   3155], or the TCP work in [RFC-3481].\n\
    \   Transition mechanisms used by cellular hosts are not described in\n   this\
    \ document and are left for further study.\n"

  contents:
  - "2.1 RFC1981 - Path MTU Discovery for IP Version 6\n   Path MTU Discovery [RFC-1981]\
    \ may be used.  Cellular hosts with a\n   link MTU larger than the minimum IPv6\
    \ link MTU (1280 octets) can use\n   Path MTU Discovery in order to discover the\
    \ real path MTU.  The\n   relative overhead of IPv6 headers is minimized through\
    \ the use of\n   longer packets, thus making better use of the available bandwidth.\n\
    \   The IPv6 specification [RFC-2460] states in Section 5 that \"a minimal\n \
    \  IPv6 implementation (e.g., in a boot ROM) may simply restrict itself\n   to\
    \ sending packets no larger than 1280 octets, and omit\n   implementation of Path\
    \ MTU Discovery.\"\n   If Path MTU Discovery is not implemented then the sending\
    \ packet size\n   is limited to 1280 octets (standard limit in [RFC-2460]).  However,\n\
    \   if this is done, the cellular host must be able to receive packets\n   with\
    \ size up to the link MTU before reassembly.  This is because the\n   node at\
    \ the other side of the link has no way of knowing less than\n   the MTU is accepted.\n"

  - "2.3 RFC2460 - Internet Protocol Version 6\n   The Internet Protocol Version 6\
    \ is specified in [RFC-2460].  This\n   specification is a mandatory part of IPv6.\n\
    \   By definition, a cellular host acts as a host, not as a router.\n   Implementation\
    \ requirements for a cellular router are not defined in\n   this document.\n \
    \  Consequently, the cellular host must implement all non-router packet\n   receive\
    \ processing as described in RFC 2460.  This includes the\n   generation of ICMPv6\
    \ error reports, and the processing of at least\n   the following extension headers:\n\
    \   - Hop-by-Hop Options header: at least the Pad1 and PadN options\n   - Destination\
    \ Options header: at least the Pad1 and PadN options\n   - Routing (Type 0) header:\
    \ final destination (host) processing only\n   - Fragment header\n   - AH and\

    \ Options or Destination Options\n   extensions must be processed as described\

    \ in RFC\n   2460.\n   The cellular host must always be able to receive and reassemble\n\
    \   fragment headers.  It will also need to be able to send a fragment\n   header\
    \ in cases where it communicates with an IPv4 host through a\n   translator (see\
    \ Section 5 of RFC2460).\n   Cellular hosts should only process routing headers\
    \ when they are the\n   final destination and return errors if the processing\
    \ of the routing\n   header requires them to forward the packet to another node.\
    \  This\n   will also ensure that the cellular hosts will not be inappropriately\n\
    \   used as relays or components in Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks.\n   Acting\
    \ as the destination involves the following:  the cellular hosts\n   must check\
    \ the Segments Left field in the header, and proceed if it\n   is zero or one\
    \ and the next address is one of the host's addresses.\n   If not, however, the\
    \ host must implement error checks as specified in\n   Section 4.4 of RFC 2460.\
    \  There is no need for the host to send\n   Routing Headers.\n"

  contents:
  - "2.4.1 Neighbor Discovery in 3GPP Networks\n   A cellular host must support Neighbor\
    \ Solicitation and Advertisement\n   messages.\n   In GPRS and UMTS networks,\
    \ some Neighbor Discovery messages can be\n   unnecessary in certain cases.  GPRS\
    \ and UMTS links resemble a point-\n   to-point link; hence, the cellular host's\
    \ only neighbor on the\n   cellular link is the default router that is already\
    \ known through\n   Router Discovery.  There are no link layer addresses.  Therefore,\n\
    \   address resolution and next-hop determination are not needed.\n   The cellular\
    \ host must support neighbor unreachability detection as\n   specified in [RFC-2461].\n\
    \   In GPRS and UMTS networks, it is very desirable to conserve\n   bandwidth.\
    \  Therefore, the cellular host should include a mechanism\n   in upper layer\
    \ protocols to provide reachability confirmation when\n   two-way IP layer reachability\
    \ can be confirmed (see RFC-2461, Section\n   7.3.1).  These confirmations will\
    \ allow the suppression of most NUD-\n   related messages in most cases.\n   Host\
    \ TCP implementation should provide reachability confirmation in\n   the manner\
    \ explained in RFC 2461, Section 7.3.1.\n   The common use of UDP in 3GPP networks\
    \ poses a problem for providing\n   reachability confirmation.  UDP itself is\
    \ unable to provide such\n   confirmation.  Applications running over UDP should\
    \ provide the\n   confirmation where possible.  In particular, when UDP is used\
    \ for\n   transporting RTP, the RTCP protocol feedback should be used as a\n \
    \  basis for the reachability confirmation.  If an RTCP packet is\n   received\
    \ with a reception report block indicating some packets have\n   gone through,\
    \ then packets are reaching the peer.  If they have\n   reached the peer, they\
    \ have also reached the neighbor.\n   When UDP is used for transporting SIP, responses\
    \ to SIP requests\n   should be used as the confirmation that packets sent to\
    \ the peer are\n   reaching it.  When the cellular host is acting as the server\
    \ side SIP\n   node, no such confirmation is generally available.  However, a\
    \ host\n   may interpret the receipt of a SIP ACK request as confirmation that\n\
    \   the previously sent response to a SIP INVITE request has reached the\n   peer.\n"

  - "2.11 RFC3041 - Privacy Extensions for Address Configuration in IPv6\n   Privacy\
    \ Extensions for Stateless Address Autoconfiguration [RFC-3041]\n   should be\
    \ supported.  RFC 3041, and privacy in general, is important\n   for the Internet.\
    \  Cellular hosts may use the temporary addresses as\n   described in RFC 3041.\
    \  However, the use of the Privacy Extension in\n   an environment where IPv6\
    \ addresses are short-lived may not be\n   necessary.  At the time this document\
    \ has been written, there is no\n   experience on how long-lived cellular network\
    \ address assignments\n   (i.e., attachments to the network) are.  The length\
    \ of the address\n   assignments depends upon many factors such as radio coverage,\
    \ device\n   status and user preferences.  Additionally, the use of temporary\n\
    \   address with IPsec may lead to more frequent renegotiation for the\n   Security\
    \ Associations.\n   Refer to Section 5 for a discussion of the benefits of privacy\n\
    \   extensions in a 3GPP network.\n"

  contents:
  - "3 IP Security\n   IPsec [RFC-2401] is a fundamental part of IPv6, and support\
    \ for AH\n   and ESP is described as mandatory in the specifications.\n   The\
    \ first part of this section discusses the applicability of IP\n   Security and\
    \ other security mechanisms for common tasks in cellular\n   hosts.  The second\
    \ part, Sections 3.1 to 3.13, lists the\n   specifications related to IPsec and\
    \ discusses the use of these parts\n   of IPsec in a cellular context.\n   In\
    \ general, the need to use a security mechanism depends on the\n   intended application\
    \ for it.  Different security mechanisms are\n   useful in different contexts,\
    \ and have different limitations.  Some\n   applications require the use of TLS\
    \ [RFC-2246], in some situations\n   IPsec is used.\n   It is not realistic to\
    \ list all possible services here, and it is\n   expected that application protocol\
    \ specifications have requirements\n   on what security services they require.\
    \  Note that cellular hosts\n   able to download applications must be prepared\
    \ to offer sufficient\n   security services for these applications regardless\
    \ of the needs of\n   the initial set of applications in those hosts.\n   The\
    \ following sections list specifications related to the IPsec\n   functionality,\
    \ and discuss their applicability in a cellular context.\n   This discussion focuses\
    \ on the use of IPsec.  In some applications, a\n   different set of protocols\
    \ may need to be employed.  In particular,\n   the below discussion is not relevant\
    \ for applications that use other\n   security services than IPsec.\n"

  - "3.8 RFC2407 - The Internet IP Security DoI for ISAKMP\n   Automatic key management,\
    \ [RFC-2408] and [RFC-2409], is not a\n   mandatory part of the IP Security Architecture.\
    \  Note, however, that\n   in the cellular environment the IP addresses of a host\
    \ may change\n   dynamically.  For this reason the use of manually configured\
    \ Security\n   Associations is not practical, as the newest host address would\
    \ have\n   to be updated to the SA database of the peer as well.\n   Even so,\
    \ it is not clear that all applications would use IKE for key\n   management.\
    \  For instance, hosts may use IPsec ESP [RFC-2406] for\n   protecting SIP signaling\
    \ in the IMS [3GPP-ACC] but provide\n   authentication and key management through\
    \ another mechanism such as\n   UMTS AKA (Authentication and Key Agreement) [UMTS-AKA].\n\
    \   It is likely that several simplifying assumptions can be made in the\n   cellular\
    \ environment, with respect to the mandated parts of the IP\n   Security DoI,\

  contents:
  - "3.10 RFC2409 - The Internet Key Exchange (IKE)\n   This specification [RFC-2409]\
    \ is optional according to the IPv6\n   specifications, but may be necessary in\
    \ some applications, as\n   described in Section 3.8.\n   Interactions with the\
    \ ICMPv6 packets and IPsec policies may cause\n   unexpected behavior for IKE-based\
    \ SA negotiation unless some special\n   handling is performed in the implementations.\n\
    \   The ICMPv6 protocol provides many functions, which in IPv4 were\n   either\
    \ non-existent or provided by lower layers.  For instance, IPv6\n   implements\
    \ address resolution using an IP packet, ICMPv6 Neighbor\n   Solicitation message.\
    \  In contrast, IPv4 uses an ARP message at a\n   lower layer.\n   The IPsec architecture\
    \ has a Security Policy Database that specifies\n   which traffic is protected,\
    \ and how.  It turns out that the\n   specification of policies in the presence\
    \ of ICMPv6 traffic is not\n   easy.  For instance, a simple policy of protecting\
    \ all traffic\n   between two hosts on the same network would trap even address\n\
    \   resolution messages, leading to a situation where IKE can't establish\n  \
    \ a Security Association since in order to send the IKE UDP packets one\n   would\
    \ have had to send the Neighbor Solicitation Message, which would\n   have required\
    \ an SA.\n   In order to avoid this problem, Neighbor Solicitation, Neighbor\n\
    \   Advertisement, Router Solicitation, and Router Advertisement messages\n  \
    \ must not lead to the use of IKE-based SA negotiation.  The Redirect\n   message\
    \ should not lead to the use of IKE-based SA negotiation.\n   Other ICMPv6 messages\
    \ may use IKE-based SA negotiation as is desired\n   in the Security Policy Data\
    \ Base.\n   Note that the above limits the usefulness of IPsec in protecting all\n\
    \   ICMPv6 communications.  For instance, it may not be possible to\n   protect\
    \ the ICMPv6 traffic between a cellular host and its next hop\n   router.  (Which\
    \ may be hard in any case due to the need to establish\n   a suitable public key\
    \ infrastructure.  Since roaming is allowed, this\n   infrastructure would have\
    \ to authenticate all hosts to all routers.)\n"

- title: 5. Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "5. Security Considerations\n   This document does not specify any new protocols\
    \ or functionality,\n   and as such, it does not introduce any new security vulnerabilities.\n\
    \   However, specific profiles of IPv6 functionality are proposed for\n   different\
    \ situations, and vulnerabilities may open or close depending\n   on which functionality\
    \ is included and what is not.  There are also\n   aspects of the cellular environment\
    \ that make certain types of\n   vulnerabilities more severe.  The following issues\
    \ are discussed:\n   - The suggested limitations (Section 2.3) in the processing\
    \ of\n     routing headers limits also exposure to DoS attacks through\n     cellular\
    \ hosts.\n   - IPv6 addressing privacy [RFC3041] may be used in cellular hosts.\n\
    \     However, it should be noted that in the 3GPP model, the network\n     would\
    \ assign new addresses, in most cases, to hosts in roaming\n     situations and\
    \ typically, also when the cellular hosts activate a\n     PDP context.  This\
    \ means that 3GPP networks will already provide a\n     limited form of addressing\
    \ privacy, and no global tracking of a\n     single host is possible through its\
    \ address.  On the other hand,\n     since a GGSN's coverage area is expected\
    \ to be very large when\n     compared to currently deployed default routers (no\
    \ handovers\n     between GGSNs are possible), a cellular host can keep an address\n\
    \     for a long time.  Hence, IPv6 addressing privacy can be used for\n     additional\
    \ privacy during the time the host is on and in the same\n     area.  The privacy\
    \ features can also be used to e.g., make\n     different transport sessions appear\
    \ to come from different IP\n     addresses.  However, it is not clear that these\
    \ additional efforts\n     confuse potential observers any further, as they could\
    \ monitor only\n     the network prefix part.\n   - The use of various security\
    \ services such as IPsec or TLS in the\n     connection of typical applications\
    \ in cellular hosts is discussed\n     in Section 3 and recommendations are given\
    \ there.\n   - Section 3 also discusses under what conditions it is possible to\n\
    \     provide IPsec protection of e.g., ICMPv6 communications.\n   - The airtime\
    \ used by cellular hosts is expensive.  In some cases,\n     users are billed\
    \ according to the amount of data they transfer to\n     and from their host.\
    \  It is crucial for both the network and the\n     users that the airtime is\
    \ used correctly and no extra charges are\n     applied to users due to misbehaving\
    \ third parties.  The cellular\n     links also have a limited capacity, which\
    \ means that they may not\n     necessarily be able to accommodate more traffic\
    \ than what the user\n     selected, such as a multimedia call.  Additional traffic\
    \ might\n     interfere with the service level experienced by the user.  While\n\
    \     Quality of Service mechanisms mitigate these problems to an extent,\n  \
    \   it is still apparent that DoS aspects may be highlighted in the\n     cellular\
    \ environment.  It is possible for existing DoS attacks that\n     use for instance\
    \ packet amplification to be substantially more\n     damaging in this environment.\
    \  How these attacks can be protected\n     against is still an area of further\
    \ study.  It is also often easy\n     to fill the cellular link and queues on\
    \ both sides with additional\n     or large packets.\n   - Within some service\
    \ provider networks, it is possible to buy a\n     prepaid cellular subscription\
    \ without presenting personal\n     identification.  Attackers that wish to remain\
    \ unidentified could\n     leverage this.  Note that while the user hasn't been\
    \ identified,\n     the equipment still is; the operators can follow the identity\
    \ of\n     the device and block it from further use.  The operators must have\n\
    \     procedures in place to take notice of third party complaints\n     regarding\
    \ the use of their customers' devices.  It may also be\n     necessary for the\
    \ operators to have attack detection tools that\n     enable them to efficiently\
    \ detect attacks launched from the\n     cellular hosts.\n   - Cellular devices\
    \ that have local network interfaces (such as IrDA\n     or Bluetooth) may be\
    \ used to launch attacks through them, unless\n     the local interfaces are secured\
    \ in an appropriate manner.\n     Therefore, local network interfaces should have\
    \ access control to\n     prevent others from using the cellular host as an intermediary.\n"

- title: Appendix A - Cellular Host IPv6 Addressing in the 3GPP Model
  contents:
  - "Appendix A - Cellular Host IPv6 Addressing in the 3GPP Model\n   The appendix\
    \ aims to very briefly describe the 3GPP IPv6 addressing\n   model for 2G (GPRS)\
    \ and 3G (UMTS) cellular networks from Release 99\n   onwards.  More information\
    \ can be found from 3GPP Technical\n   Specification 23.060.\n   There are two\
    \ possibilities to allocate the address for an IPv6 node:\n   stateless and stateful\
    \ autoconfiguration.  The stateful address\n   allocation mechanism needs a DHCP\
    \ server to allocate the address for\n   the IPv6 node.  On the other hand, the\
    \ stateless autoconfiguration\n   procedure does not need any external entity\
    \ involved in the address\n   autoconfiguration (apart from the GGSN).\n   In\
    \ order to support the standard IPv6 stateless address\n   autoconfiguration mechanism,\
    \ as recommended by the IETF, the GGSN\n   shall assign a prefix that is unique\
    \ within its scope to each primary\n   PDP context that uses IPv6 stateless address\
    \ autoconfiguration.  This\n   avoids the necessity to perform Duplicate Address\
    \ Detection at the\n   network level for every address built by the mobile host.\
    \  The GGSN\n   always provides an Interface Identifier to the mobile host.  The\n\
    \   Mobile host uses the interface identifier provided by the GGSN to\n   generate\
    \ its link-local address.  The GGSN provides the cellular host\n   with the interface\
    \ identifier, usually in a random manner.  It must\n   ensure the uniqueness of\
    \ such identifier on the link (i.e., no\n   collisions between its own link-local\
    \ address and the cellular\n   host's).\n   In addition, the GGSN will not use\
    \ any of the prefixes assigned to\n   cellular hosts to generate any of its own\
    \ addresses.  This use of the\n   interface identifier, combined with the fact\
    \ that each PDP context is\n   allocated a unique prefix, will eliminate the need\
    \ for DAD messages\n   over the air interface, and consequently allows an efficient\
    \ use of\n   bandwidth.  Furthermore, the allocation of a prefix to each PDP\n\
    \   context will allow hosts to implement the privacy extensions in RFC\n   3041\
    \ without the need for further DAD messages.\n"
