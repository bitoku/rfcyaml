  - "1.  Introduction\n   The contents of this Informational RFC is technically equivalent\
    \ to\n   ETSI TS 102 023 V 1.2.1 (2002-06) [TS 102023].  The ETSI TS is under\n\
    \   the ETSI Copyright (C).  Individual copies of this ETSI deliverable\n   can\
    \ be downloaded from http://www.etsi.org\n   In creating reliable and manageable\
    \ digital evidence it is necessary\n   to have an agreed upon method of associating\
    \ time data to transaction\n   so that they might be compared to each other at\
    \ a later time.  The\n   quality of this evidence is based on creating and managing\
    \ the data\n   structure that represent the events and the quality of the parametric\n\
    \   data points that anchor them to the real world.  In this instance\n   this\
    \ being the time data and how it was applied.\n   A typical transaction is a digitally\
    \ signed document, where it is\n   necessary to prove that the digital signature\
    \ from the signer was\n   applied when the signer's certificate was valid.\n \
    \  A timestamp or a time mark (which is an audit record kept in a secure\n   audit\
    \ trail from a trusted third party) applied to a digital\n   signature value proves\
    \ that the digital signature was created before\n   the date included in the time-stamp\
    \ or time mark.\n   To prove the digital signature was generated while the signer's\n\
    \   certificate was valid, the digital signature must be verified and the\n  \
    \ following conditions satisfied:\n      1. the time-stamp (or time mark) was\
    \ applied before the end of the\n         validity period of the signer's certificate,\n\
    \      2. the time-stamp (or time mark) was applied either while the\n       \
    \  signer's certificate was not revoked or before the revocation\n         date\
    \ of the certificate.\n   Thus a time-stamp (or time mark) applied in this manner\
    \ proves that\n   the digital signature was created while the signer's certificate\
    \ was\n   valid. This concept proves the validity of a digital signature over\n\
    \   the whole of any certificate chain.\n   Policy requirements to cover that\
    \ case is the primary reason of this\n   document.  However, it should be observed\
    \ that these policy\n   requirements can be used to address other needs.\n   The\
    \ electronic time stamp is gaining interest from the business\n   sector as an\
    \ important component of electronic signatures.  It is\n   also featured by the\
    \ ETSI Electronic Signature Format standard [TS\n   101733] or Electronic Signature\
    \ Formats for long term electronic\n   signatures [RFC 3126], built upon the Time-Stamp\
    \ Protocol [RFC 3161].\n   Agreed minimum security and quality requirements are\
    \ necessary in\n   order to ensure trustworthy validation of long-term electronic\n\
    \   signatures.\n   The European Directive 1999/93/EC [Dir 99/93/EC] defines\n\
    \   certification service provider as \"an entity or a legal or natural\n   person\
    \ who issues certificates or provides other services related to\n   electronic\
    \ signatures\".  One example of a certification-service-\n   provider is a Time-Stamping\
    \ Authority.\n   The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\"\
    , \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and\
    \ \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n   document are to be interpreted as described in BCP\
    \ 14, RFC 2119\n   [RFC 2119].\n"

  - "2.  Overview\n   These policy requirements are aimed at time-stamping services\
    \ used in\n   support of qualified electronic signatures (i.e., in line with\n\
    \   article 5.1 of the European Directive on a community framework for\n   electronic\
    \ signatures) but may be applied to any application\n   requiring to prove that\
    \ a datum existed before a particular time.\n   These policy requirements are\
    \ based on the use of public key\n   cryptography, public key certificates and\
    \ reliable time sources. The\n   present document may be used by independent bodies\
    \ as the basis for\n   confirming that a TSA may be trusted for providing time-stamping\n\
    \   services.\n   This document addresses requirements for synchronizing TSAs\
    \ issuing\n   time-stamp tokens with Coordinated universal time (UTC) and digitally\n\
    \   signed by TSUs.\n   Subscriber and relying parties should consult the TSA's\
    \ practice\n   statement to obtain further details of precisely how this time-stamp\n\
    \   policy is implemented by the particular TSA (e.g., protocols used in\n   providing\
    \ this service).\n   This document does not specify:\n      - protocols used to\
    \ access the TSUs;\n   NOTE 1: A time-stamping protocol is defined in RFC 3161\
    \ [RFC 3161]\n   and profiled in TS 101 861 [TS 101861].\n      -  how the requirements\
    \ identified herein may be assessed by an\n         independent body;\n      -\

    \ down into the\n   following component services for the purposes of classifying\n\
    \   requirements:\n   -  Time-stamping provision: This service component generates\n\

    \      service component is responsibile  for the installation and\n      de-installation\
    \ of the time-stamping provision service. For\n      example, time-stamping management\
    \ ensures that the clock used for\n      time-stamping is correctly synchronized\
    \ with UTC.\n   This subdivision of services is only for the purposes of clarifying\n\
    \   the requirements specified in the current document and places no\n   restrictions\
    \ on any subdivision of an implementation of time-stamping\n   services.\n"
- title: 4.2.  Time-Stamping Authority
  contents:
  - "4.2.  Time-Stamping Authority\n   The authority to issue time-stamp tokens, trusted\
    \ by the users of the\n   time-stamping services, i.e., subscribers and relying\
    \ parties, is\n   called the Time-Stamping Authority (TSA).  TSA has overall\n\
    \   responsibility for time-stamping services identified in clause 4.1.\n   The\
    \ TSA has responsibility for the operation of one or more TSU's\n   which creates\
    \ and signs on behalf of the TSA.  The TSA responsible\n   for issuing a time-stamp\
    \ token is identifiable (see 7.3.1 h).\n   The TSA may use other parties to provide\
    \ parts of the Time-Stamping\n   Services.  However, the TSA always maintains\
    \ overall responsibility\n   and ensures that the policy requirements identified\
    \ in the present\n   document are met.  For example, a TSA may sub-contract all\
    \ the\n   component services, including the services which generate time-stamp\n\
    \   tokens using the TSU's keys.  However, the private key or keys used\n   to\
    \ generate the time-stamp tokens belong to the TSA which maintains\n   overall\
    \ responsibility for meeting the requirements in this document.\n   A TSA may\
    \ operate several identifiable time-stamping units.  Each\n   unit has a different\
    \ key.  See Annex B for possible implementations.\n   A TSA is a certification-service-provider,\
    \ as defined in the EU\n   Directive on Electronic Signatures (see article 2(11)),\
    \ which issues\n   time-stamp tokens.\n"
- title: 4.3.  Subscriber
  contents:
  - "4.3.  Subscriber\n   The subscriber may be an organization comprising several\
    \ end-users or\n   an individual end-user.\n   When the subscriber is an organization,\
    \ some of the obligations that\n   apply to that organization will have to apply\
    \ as well to the end-\n   users. In any case the organization will be held responsible\
    \ if the\n   obligations from the end-users are not correctly fulfilled and\n\
    \   therefore the organization is expected to suitably inform its end\n   users.\n\
    \   When the subscriber is an end-user, the end-user will be held\n   directly\
    \ responsible if its obligations are not correctly fulfilled.\n"
- title: 4.4.  Time-Stamp Policy and TSA Practice Statement
  contents:
  - "4.4.  Time-Stamp Policy and TSA Practice Statement\n   This section explains\
    \ the relative roles of Time-stamp policy and TSA\n   practice statement.  It\
    \ places no restriction on the form of a time-\n   stamp policy or practice statement\
    \ specification.\n"
- title: 4.4.1.  Purpose
  contents:
  - "4.4.1.  Purpose\n   In general, the time-stamp policy states \"what is to be\
    \ adhered to,\"\n   while a TSA practice statement states \"how it is adhered\
    \ to\", i.e.,\n   the processes it will use in creating time-stamps and maintaining\
    \ the\n   accuracy of its clock.  The relationship between the time-stamp\n  \
    \ policy and TSA practice statement is similar in nature to the\n   relationship\
    \ of other business policies which state the requirements\n   of the business,\
    \ while operational units define the practices and\n   procedures of how these\
    \ policies are to be carried out.\n   The present document specifies a time-stamp\
    \ policy to meet general\n   requirements for trusted time-stamping services.\
    \  TSAs specify in TSA\n   practice statements how these requirements are met.\n"
- title: 4.4.2.  Level of Specificity
  contents:
  - "4.4.2.  Level of Specificity\n   The TSA practice statement is more specific\
    \ than a time-stamp policy.\n   A TSA practice statement is a more detailed description\
    \ of the terms\n   and conditions as well as business and operational practices\
    \ of a TSA\n   in issuing and otherwise managing time-stamping services.  The\
    \ TSA\n   practice statement of a TSA enforces the rules established by a\n  \
    \ time-stamp policy.  A TSA practice statement defines how a specific\n   TSA\
    \ meets the technical, organizational and procedural requirements\n   identified\
    \ in a time-stamp policy.\n   NOTE: Even lower-level internal documentation may\
    \ be appropriate for\n   a TSA detailing the specific procedures necessary to\
    \ complete the\n   practices identified in the TSA practice statement.\n"
- title: 4.4.3.  Approach
  contents:
  - "4.4.3.  Approach\n   The approach of a time-stamp policy is significantly different\
    \ from a\n   TSA practice statement.  A time-stamp policy is defined independently\n\
    \   of the specific details of the specific operating environment of a\n   TSA,\
    \ whereas a TSA practice statement is tailored to the\n   organizational structure,\
    \ operating procedures, facilities, and\n   computing environment of a TSA.  A\
    \ time-stamp policy may be defined\n   by the user of times-stamp services, whereas\
    \ the TSA practice\n   statement is always defined by the provider.\n"

  - "5.1.  Overview\n   A time-stamp policy is a \"named set of rules that indicates\
    \ the\n   applicability of a time-stamp token to a particular community and/or\n\
    \   class of application with common security requirements\" (see clauses\n  \
    \ 3.1 and 4.4).\n   The present document defines requirements for a baseline time-stamp\n\
    \   policy for TSAs issuing time-stamp tokens, supported by public key\n   certificates,\
    \ with an accuracy of 1 second or better.\n   NOTE 1: Without additional measures\
    \ the relying party may not be able\n   to ensure the validity of a time-stamp\
    \ token beyond the end of the\n   validity period of the supporting certificate.\
    \  See Annex C on\n   verification of the validity of a time-stamp token beyond\
    \ the\n   validity period of the TSU's certificate.\n   A TSA may define its own\
    \ policy which enhances the policy defined in\n   this document.  Such a policy\
    \ shall incorporate or further constrain\n   the requirements identified in this\
    \ document.\n   If an accuracy of better than 1 second is provided by a TSA and\
    \ if\n   all the TSUs have that same characteristics, then the accuracy shall\n\
    \   be indicated in the TSA's disclosure statement (see section 7.1.2)\n   that\
    \  each time-stamp token is issued with an accuracy of better than\n   1 second.\n\
    \   NOTE 2: It is required that a time-stamp token includes an identifier\n  \
    \ for the applicable policy (see section 7.3.1).\n"

    \ Directive on Electronic\n   Signatures) for long term validity (e.g., as defined\
    \ in TS 101 733\n   [TS 101733]), but is generally applicable to any requirement\
    \ for an\n   equivalent quality.\n   This policy may be used for public time-stamping\
    \ services or time-\n   stamping services used within a closed community.\n"
- title: 5.4.  Conformance
  contents:
  - "5.4.  Conformance\n   The TSA shall use the identifier for the time-stamp policy\
    \ in time-\n   stamp tokens as given in section 5.2, or define its own time-stamp\n\
    \   policy that incorporates or further constrains the requirements\n   identified\
    \ in the present document:\n   a) if the TSA claims conformance to the identified\
    \ time-stamp policy\n      and makes available to subscribers and relying parties\
    \ on request\n      the evidence to support the claim of conformance; or\n   b)\
    \ if the TSA has been assessed to conform to the identified time-\n      stamp\
    \ policy by an independent party.\n   A conformant TSA must demonstrate that:\n\
    \   a) it meets its obligations as defined in section 6.1;\n   b) it has implemented\
    \ controls which meet the requirements specified\n      in section 7.\n"

  - "8.  Security Considerations\n   When verifying time-stamp tokens it is necessary\
    \ for the verifier to\n   ensure that the TSU certificate is trusted and not revoked.\
    \  This\n   means that the security is dependent upon the security of the CA that\n\
    \   has issued the TSU certificate for both issuing the certificate and\n   providing\
    \ accurate revocation status information for that\n   certificate.\n   When a\
    \ time-stamp is verified as valid at a given point of time, this\n   does not\
    \ mean that it will necessarily remain valid later on.  Every\n   time, a time-stamp\
    \ token is verified during the validity period of\n   the TSU certificate, it\
    \ must be verified again against the current\n   revocation status information,\
    \ since in case of compromise of a TSU\n   private key, all the time-stamp tokens\
    \ generated by that TSU become\n   invalid.  Annex C provides guidance about the\
    \ long term verification\n   of time-stamp tokens.\n   In applying time-stamping\
    \ to applications, consideration also needs\n   to be given to the security of\
    \ the application.  In particular, when\n   applying time-stamps it is necessary\
    \ to ensure that the integrity of\n   data is maintained before the time-stamp\
    \ is applied.  The requester\n   ought to really make sure that the hash value\
    \ included in the time-\n   stamp token matches with the hash of the data.\n"

  - "Annex A (informative): Coordinated Universal Time\n   Coordinated Universal Time\
    \ (UTC) is the international time standard\n   that became effective on January\
    \ 1, 1972.  UTC has superseded\n   Greenwich Mean Time (GMT), but in practice\
    \ they are never more than 1\n   second different.  Hence many people continue\
    \ to refer to GMT when in\n   fact they operate to UTC.\n   Zero (0) hours UTC\
    \ is midnight in Greenwich, England, which lies on\n   the zero longitudinal meridian.\
    \  Universal time is based on a 24 hour\n   clock, therefore, afternoon hours\
    \ such as 4 pm UTC are expressed as\n   16:00 UTC (sixteen hours, zero minutes).\n\
    \   International Atomic Time (TAI) is calculated by the Bureau\n   International\
    \ des Poids et Mesures (BIPM) from the readings of more\n   than 200 atomic clocks\
    \ located in metrology institutes and\n   observatories in more than 30 countries\
    \ around the world.\n   Information on TAI is made available every month in the\
    \ BIPM Circular\n   T (ftp://62.161.69.5/pub/tai/publication).  It is that TAI\
    \ does not\n   lose or gain with respect to an imaginary perfect clock by more\
    \ than\n   about one tenth of a microsecond (0.0000001 second) per year.\n   Coordinated\
    \ Universal Time (UTC): Time scale, based on the second, as\n   defined and recommended\
    \ by the International Telecommunications Radio\n   Committee (ITU-R), and maintained\
    \ by the Bureau International des\n   Poids et Mesures (BIPM).  The maintenance\
    \ by BIPM includes\n   cooperation among various national laboratories around\
    \ the world.\n   The full definition of UTC is contained in ITU-R Recommendation\n\
    \   TF.460-4.\n   Atomic Time, with the unit of duration the Systeme International\
    \ (SI)\n   second defined as the duration of 9 192 631 770 cycles of radiation,\n\
    \   corresponds to the transition between two hyperfine levels of the\n   ground\
    \ state of caesium 133.  TAI is the International Atomic Time\n   scale, a statistical\
    \ timescale based on a large number of atomic\n   clocks.\n   Universal Time (UT)\
    \ is counted from 0 hours at midnight, with unit of\n   duration the mean solar\
    \ day, defined to be as uniform as possible\n   despite variations in the rotation\
    \ of the Earth.\n      -  UT0 is the rotational time of a particular place of\n\
    \         observation. It is observed as the diurnal motion of stars or\n    \
    \     extraterrestrial radio sources.\n      -  UT1 is computed by correcting\
    \ UT0 for the effect of polar\n         motion on the longitude of the observing\
    \ site.  It varies from\n         uniformity because of the irregularities in\
    \ the Earth's\n         rotation. UT1, is based on the somewhat irregular rotation\
    \ of\n         the Earth. Rotational irregularities usually result in a net\n\
    \         decrease in the Earth's average rotational velocity, and\n         ensuing\
    \ lags of UT1 with respect to UTC.\n   Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) is the\
    \ basis for international\n   time-keeping and follows TAI exactly except for\
    \ an integral number of\n   seconds, 32 in year 2001.  These leap seconds are\
    \ inserted on the\n   advice of the International Earth Rotation Service (IERS)\n\
    \   (http://hpiers.obspm.fr/) to ensure that, having taken into account\n   irregularities,\
    \ the Sun is overhead within 0,9 seconds of 12:00:00\n   UTC on the meridian of\
    \ Greenwich.  UTC is thus the modern successor\n   of Greenwich Mean Time, GMT,\
    \ which was used when the unit of time was\n   the mean solar day.\n   Adjustments\
    \ to the atomic, i.e., UTC, time scale consist of an\n   occasional addition or\
    \ deletion of one full second, which is called a\n   leap second.  Twice yearly,\
    \ during the last minute of the day of June\n   30 and December 31, Universal\
    \ Time, adjustments may be made to ensure\n   that the accumulated difference\
    \ between UTC and UT1 will not exceed\n   0,9 s before the next scheduled adjustment.\
    \  Historically,\n   adjustments, when necessary, have usually consisted of adding\
    \ an\n   extra second to the UTC time scale in order to allow the rotation of\n\
    \   the Earth to \"catch up\". Therefore, the last minute of the UTC time\n  \
    \ scale, on the day when an adjustment is made, will have 61 seconds.\n   Adjustments\
    \ dates are typically announced several months in advance\n   in IERS Bulletin\
    \ C:\n   ftp://hpiers.obspm.fr/iers/bul/bulc/bulletinc.dat.\n   Coordinated Universal\
    \ Time (UTC) differs thus from TAI by an integral\n   number of seconds.  UTC\
    \ is kept within 0,9 s of UT1 by the\n   introduction of one-second steps to UTC,\
    \ the \"leap second\".  To date\n   these steps have always been positive.\n"

  - "Annex C (informative): Long Term Verification of Time-Stamp Tokens\n   Usually,\
    \ a time-stamp token becomes unverifiable beyond the end of\n   the validity period\
    \ of the certificate from the TSU, because the CA\n   that has issued the certificate\
    \ does not warrant any more that it\n   will publish revocation data, including\
    \ data about revocations due to\n   key compromises.  However, verification of\
    \ a time-stamp token might\n   still be performed beyond the end of the validity\
    \ period of the\n   certificate from the TSU, if, at the time of verification,\
    \ it can be\n   known that:\n      - the TSU private key has not been compromised\
    \ at any time up to\n        the time that a relying part verifies a time-stamp\
    \ token;\n      - the hash algorithms used in the time-stamp token exhibits no\n\
    \        collisions at the time of verification;\n      - the signature algorithm\
    \ and signature key size under which the\n        time-stamp token has been signed\
    \ is still beyond the reach of\n        cryptographic attacks at the time of verification.\n\
    \   If these conditions cannot be met, then the validity may be\n   maintained\
    \ by applying an additional time-stamp to protect the\n   integrity of the previous\
    \ one.\n   The present document does not specify the details of how such\n   protection\
    \ may be obtained.  For the time being, and until some\n   enhancements are defined\
    \ to support these features, the information\n   may be obtained using-out-of\
    \ bands means or alternatively in the\n   context of closed environments.  As\
    \ an example, should a CA guaranty\n   to maintain the revocation status of TSU\
    \ certificates after the end\n   of its validity period, this would fulfill the\
    \ first requirement.\n   NOTE 1: An alternative to Time-Stamping is for a Trusted\
    \ Service\n   Provider to record a representation of a datum bound to a particular\n\
    \   time in an audit trail, thus establishing evidence that the datum\n   existed\
    \ before that time.  This technique, which is called Time-\n   Marking, can be\
    \ a valuable alternative for checking the long term\n   validity of signatures.\n\
