  - "1.  Introduction\n   HTTP defines a set of status codes for the purpose of redirecting
    a\n   request to a different URI ([RFC3986]).  The history of these status\n   codes
    is summarized in Section 6.4 of [RFC7231], which also\n   classifies the existing
    status codes into four categories.\n   The first of these categories contains
    the status codes 301 (Moved\n   Permanently), 302 (Found), and 307 (Temporary
    Redirect), which can be\n   classified as below:\n   +-------------------------------------------+-----------+-----------+\n
    \  |                                           | Permanent | Temporary |\n   +-------------------------------------------+-----------+-----------+\n
    \  | Allows changing the request method from   | 301       | 302       |\n   |
    POST to GET                               |           |           |\n   | Does
    not allow changing the request       | -         | 307       |\n   | method from
    POST to GET                   |           |           |\n   +-------------------------------------------+-----------+-----------+\n
    \  Section 6.4.7 of [RFC7231] states that it does not define a permanent\n   variant
    of status code 307; this specification adds the status code\n   308, defining
    this missing variant (Section 3).\n   This specification contains no technical
    changes from the\n   Experimental RFC 7238, which it obsoletes.\n"

    \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\",
    and \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].\n"
  title: 2.  Notational Conventions
- contents:
  - "3.  308 Permanent Redirect\n   The 308 (Permanent Redirect) status code indicates
    that the target\n   resource has been assigned a new permanent URI and any future\n
    \  references to this resource ought to use one of the enclosed URIs.\n   Clients
    with link editing capabilities ought to automatically re-link\n   references to
    the effective request URI (Section 5.5 of [RFC7230]) to\n   one or more of the
    new references sent by the server, where possible.\n   The server SHOULD generate
    a Location header field ([RFC7231],\n   Section 7.1.2) in the response containing
    a preferred URI reference\n   for the new permanent URI.  The user agent MAY use
    the Location field\n   value for automatic redirection.  The server's response
    payload\n   usually contains a short hypertext note with a hyperlink to the new\n
    \  URI(s).\n   A 308 response is cacheable by default; i.e., unless otherwise\n
    \  indicated by the method definition or explicit cache controls (see\n   [RFC7234],
    Section 4.2.2).\n      Note: This status code is similar to 301 (Moved Permanently)\n
    \     ([RFC7231], Section 6.4.2), except that it does not allow changing\n      the
    request method from POST to GET.\n"
  title: 3.  308 Permanent Redirect
- contents:
  - "4.  Deployment Considerations\n   Section 6 of [RFC7231] requires recipients
    to treat unknown 3xx\n   status codes the same way as status code 300 (Multiple
    Choices)\n   ([RFC7231], Section 6.4.1).  Thus, servers will not be able to rely\n
    \  on automatic redirection happening similar to status codes 301, 302,\n   or
    307.\n   Therefore, the use of status code 308 is restricted to cases where\n
    \  the server has sufficient confidence in the client's understanding\n   the
    new code or when a fallback to the semantics of status code 300\n   is not problematic.
    \ Server implementers are advised not to vary the\n   status code based on characteristics
    of the request, such as the\n   User-Agent header field (\"User-Agent Sniffing\")
    -- doing so usually\n   results in code that is both hard to maintain and hard
    to debug and\n   would also require special attention to caching (i.e., setting
    a\n   \"Vary\" response header field, as defined in Section 7.1.4 of\n   [RFC7231]).\n
    \  Note that many existing HTML-based user agents will emulate a refresh\n   when
    encountering an HTML <meta> refresh directive ([HTML],\n   Section 4.2.5.3).  This
    can be used as another fallback.  For\n   example:\n   Client request:\n     GET
    / HTTP/1.1\n     Host: example.com\n   Server response:\n     HTTP/1.1 308 Permanent
    Redirect\n     Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8\n     Location: http://example.com/new\n
    \    Content-Length: 356\n     <!DOCTYPE HTML>\n     <html>\n        <head>\n
    \          <title>Permanent Redirect</title>\n           <meta http-equiv=\"refresh\"\n
    \                content=\"0; url=http://example.com/new\">\n        </head>\n
    \       <body>\n           <p>\n              The document has been moved to\n
    \             <a href=\"http://example.com/new\"\n              >http://example.com/new</a>.\n
    \          </p>\n        </body>\n     </html>\n"

  - "5.  Security Considerations\n   All security considerations that apply to HTTP
    redirects apply to the\n   308 status code as well (see Section 9 of [RFC7231]).\n
    \  Unsecured communication over the Internet is subject to man-in-the-\n   middle
    modification of messages, including changing status codes or\n   redirect targets.
    \ Use of Transport Layer Security (TLS) is one way\n   to mitigate those attacks.
    \ See Section 9 of [RFC7230] for related\n   attacks on authority and message
    integrity.\n"
