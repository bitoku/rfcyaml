- title: Abstract
  contents:
  - "Abstract\n   Over the last two years, the attendance at Internet Engineering\
    \ Task\n   Force (IETF) plenary meetings has grown phenomenally.  Approximately\n\
    \   one third of the attendees are new to the IETF at each meeting, and\n   many\
    \ of those go on to become regular attendees.  When the meetings\n   were smaller,\
    \ it wasn't very difficult for a newcomer to get into the\n   swing of things.\
    \  Today, however, a newcomer meets many more new\n   people, some previously\
    \ known only as the authors of documents or\n   thought provoking e-mail messages.\n\
    \   The purpose of this For Your Information (FYI) RFC is to explain to\n   the\
    \ newcomers how the IETF works.  This will give them a warm, fuzzy\n   feeling\
    \ and enable them to make the meeting more productive for\n   everyone.  This\
    \ FYI will also provide the mundane bits of information\n   which everyone who\
    \ attends an IETF meeting should know.\n"

- title: What is the IETF?
  contents:
  - "What is the IETF?\n   The Internet Engineering Task Force is a loosely self-organized\
    \ group\n   of people who make technical and other contributions to the\n   engineering\
    \ and evolution of the Internet and its technologies.  It\n   is the principal\
    \ body engaged in the development of new Internet\n   standard specifications.\
    \  Its mission includes:\n   o  Identifying, and proposing solutions to, pressing\
    \ operational and\n      technical problems in the Internet;\n   o  Specifying\
    \ the development or usage of protocols and the near-term\n      architecture\
    \ to solve such technical problems for the Internet;\n   o  Making recommendations\
    \ to the Internet Engineering Steering Group\n      (IESG) regarding the standardization\
    \ of protocols and protocol\n      usage in the Internet;\n   o  Facilitating\
    \ technology transfer from the Internet Research Task\n      Force (IRTF) to the\
    \ wider Internet community; and\n   o  Providing a forum for the exchange of information\
    \ within the\n      Internet community between vendors, users, researchers, agency\n\
    \      contractors and network managers.\n   The IETF meeting is not a conference,\
    \ although there are technical\n   presentations.  The IETF is not a traditional\
    \ standards organization,\n   although many specifications are produced that become\
    \ standards.  The\n   IETF is made up of volunteers who meet three times a year\
    \ to fulfill\n   the IETF mission.\n   There is no membership in the IETF.  Anyone\
    \ may register for and\n   attend any meeting.  The closest thing there is to\
    \ being an IETF\n   member is being on the IETF or working group mailing lists\
    \ (see the\n   IETF Mailing Lists section).  This is where the best information\n\
    \   about current IETF activities and focus can be found.\n"
- title: Humble Beginnings
  contents:
  - "Humble Beginnings\n   The 1st IETF meeting was held in January, 1986 at Linkabit\
    \ in San\n   Diego with 15 attendees.  The 4th IETF, held at SRI in Menlo Park\
    \ in\n   October, 1986, was the first at which non-government vendors\n   attended.\
    \  The concept of working groups was introduced at the 5th\n   IETF meeting at\
    \ the NASA Ames Research Center in California in\n   February, 1987.  The 7th\
    \ IETF, held at MITRE in McLean, Virginia in\n   July, 1987, was the first meeting\
    \ with over 100 attendees.\n   The 14th IETF meeting was held at Stanford University\
    \ in July, 1989.\n   It marked a major change in the structure of the IETF universe.\
    \  The\n   IAB (then Internet Activities Board, now Internet Architecture\n  \
    \ Board), which until that time oversaw many \"task forces,\" changed its\n  \
    \ structure to leave only two: the IETF and the IRTF.  The IRTF is\n   tasked\
    \ to consider the long-term research problems in the Internet.\n   The IETF also\
    \ changed at that time.\n   After the Internet Society (ISOC) was formed in January,\
    \ 1992, the\n   IAB proposed to ISOC that the IAB's activities should take place\n\
    \   under the auspices of the Internet Society.  During INET92 in Kobe,\n   Japan,\
    \ the ISOC Trustees approved a new charter for the IAB to\n   reflect the proposed\
    \ relationship.\n   The IETF met in Amsterdam, The Netherlands, in July, 1993.\
    \ This was\n   the the first IETF meeting held in Europe, and the US/non-US attendee\n\
    \   split was nearly 50/50.  A second European meeting is scheduled for\n   July\
    \ 1995 in Stockholm, Sweden.\n"
- title: The Hierarchy
  contents:
  - "The Hierarchy\n   To completely understand the structure of the IETF, it is useful\
    \ to\n   understand the overall structure in which the IETF resides.  There\n\
    \   are four groups in the structure: the ISOC and its Board of Trustees,\n  \
    \ the IAB, the IESG and the IETF itself.\n   The Internet Society is a professional\
    \ society that is concerned with\n   the growth and evolution of the worldwide\
    \ Internet, with the way in\n   which the Internet is and can be used, and with\
    \ the social,\n   political, and technical issues which arise as a result.  The\
    \ ISOC\n   Trustees are responsible for approving appointments to the IAB from\n\
    \   among the nominees submitted by the IETF nominating committee.\n   The IAB\
    \ is a technical advisory group of the ISOC.  It is chartered\n   to provide oversight\
    \ of the architecture of the Internet and its\n   protocols, and to serve, in\
    \ the context of the Internet standards\n   process, as a body to which the decisions\
    \ of the IESG may be\n   appealed.  The IAB is responsible for approving appointments\
    \ to the\n   IESG from among the nominees submitted by the IETF nominations\n\
    \   committee.\n   The IESG is responsible for technical management of IETF activities\n\
    \   and the Internet standards process.  As part of the ISOC, it\n   administers\
    \ the process according to the rules and procedures which\n   have been ratified\
    \ by the ISOC Trustees.  The IESG is directly\n   responsible for the actions\
    \ associated with entry into and movement\n   along the Internet \"standards track,\"\
    \ including final approval of\n   specifications as Internet Standards.\n   The\
    \ IETF is divided into eight functional areas.  They are:\n   Applications, Internet,\
    \ Network Management, Operational Requirements,\n   Routing, Security, Transport\
    \ and User Services.  Each area has one or\n   two area directors.  The area directors,\
    \ along with the IETF/IESG\n   Chair, form the IESG.  Paul Mockepetris is the\
    \ current IETF/IESG\n   Chair.\n   Each area has several working groups.  A working\
    \ group is a group of\n   people who work under a charter to achieve a certain\
    \ goal.  That goal\n   may be the creation of an Informational document, the creation\
    \ of a\n   protocol specification, or the resolution of problems in the\n   Internet.\
    \  Most working groups have a finite lifetime.  That is, once\n   a working group\
    \ has achieved its goal, it disbands.  As in the IETF,\n   there is no official\
    \ membership for a working group.  Unofficially, a\n   working group member is\
    \ somebody who is on that working group's\n   mailing list; however, anyone may\
    \ attend a working group meeting (see\n   the Be Prepared section below).\n  \
    \ Areas may also have Birds of a Feather (BOF) sessions.  They\n   generally have\
    \ the same goals as working groups, except that they\n   have no charter and usually\
    \ only meet once or twice.  BOFs are often\n   held to determine if there is enough\
    \ interest to form a working\n   group.\n"
- title: IETF Mailing Lists
  contents:
  - "IETF Mailing Lists\n   Anyone who plans to attend an IETF meeting should join\
    \ the IETF\n   announcement mailing list.  This is where all of the meeting\n\
    \   information, Internet-Draft and RFC announcements, and IESG Protocol\n   Actions\
    \ and Last Calls are posted.  People who would like to \"get\n   technical\" may\
    \ also join the IETF discussion list,\n   \"ietf@cnri.reston.va.us\".  This is\
    \ where discussions of cosmic\n   significance are held (most working groups have\
    \ their own mailing\n   lists for discussions related to their work).  To join\
    \ the IETF\n   announcement list, send a request to:\n        ietf-announce-request@cnri.reston.va.us\n\
    \   To join the IETF discussion list, send a request to:\n        ietf-request@cnri.reston.va.us\n\
    \   To join both of the lists, simply send a single message, to either\n   \"\
    -request\" address, and indicate that you'd like to join both lists.\n   Do not,\
    \ ever, under any circumstances, for any reason, send a request\n   to join a\
    \ list to the list itself!  The thousands of people on the\n   list don't need,\
    \ or want, to know when a new person joins.\n   Similarly, when changing e-mail\
    \ addresses or leaving a list, send\n   your request only to the \"-request\"\
    \ address, not to the main list.\n   This means you!!\n   The IETF discussion\
    \ list is unmoderated.  This means that anyone can\n   express their opinions\
    \ about issues affecting the Internet.  However,\n   it is not a place for companies\
    \ or individuals to solicit or\n   advertise.  Only the Secretariat can send messages\
    \ to the\n   announcement list.\n   Even though the IETF mailing lists \"represent\"\
    \ the IETF membership at\n   large, it is important to note that attending an\
    \ IETF meeting does\n   not automatically include addition to either mailing list.\n"
- title: Registration
  contents:
  - "Registration\n   As previously mentioned, all meeting announcements are sent\
    \ to the\n   IETF announcement list.  Within the IETF meeting announcement is\
    \ a\n   registration form and complete instructions for registering,\n   including,\
    \ of course, the cost.  The Secretariat highly recommends\n   that attendees preregister.\
    \  Early registration, which ends about one\n   month before the meeting, carries\
    \ a lower registration fee.  As the\n   size of the meetings has grown, so has\
    \ the length of the lines at the\n   registration desk.  There are two lines:\
    \ \"paid\" (which moves very\n   quickly), and \"not paid\" (which moves slowly).\n\
    \   Registration is open all week.  However, the Secretariat highly\n   recommends\
    \ that attendees arrive for early registration, beginning at\n   18:00 (meeting\
    \ local time), on the Sunday before the opening plenary.\n   Not only will there\
    \ be fewer people, but there will also be a\n   reception at which people can\
    \ get a bite to eat.  If the registration\n   lines are long, one can eat first\
    \ and try again when the lines are\n   shorter.\n   Registered attendees (and\
    \ there isn't any other kind) receive a\n   registration packet.  It contains\
    \ a general orientation sheet, the\n   at-a-glance sheet, a list of working group\
    \ acronyms, the most recent\n   agenda and a name tag.  The at-a-glance is a very\
    \ important reference\n   and is used throughout the week.  It contains working\
    \ group and BOF\n   room assignments and a map of room locations.  Attendees who\
    \ prepaid\n   will also find their receipt in their packet.\n"
- title: Newcomers' Orientation
  contents:
  - "Newcomers' Orientation\n   Newcomers are encouraged to attend the IETF Newcomers'\
    \ Orientation.\n   As the name implies, it is an orientation for first-time attendees\
    \ to\n   IETF meetings.  The orientation is organized and conducted by the\n \
    \  IETF Secretariat and is intended to provide useful introductory\n   information.\
    \  The IETF Secretariat is made up of Cynthia Clark, Steve\n   Coya, Debra Legare,\
    \ John Stewart and Megan Walnut.\n   The orientation is typically about an hour\
    \ long and covers a number\n   of topics: what's in the attendee packets, what\
    \ all the dots on name\n   tags mean and how to read the at-a-glance.  There is\
    \ also discussion\n   about the structure of the IETF and the Internet standards\
    \ process.\n   There is ample time at the end for questions.  The Secretariat\
    \ also\n   provides handouts which include an overview of the IETF, a list of\n\
    \   important files available on-line and hard copies of the slides of\n   the\
    \ \"structure and standards\" presentation.\n   The orientation is held on Sunday\
    \ afternoon before the registration\n   reception.  However, attending the orientation\
    \ does NOT mean you can\n   go to the reception early!\n"
- title: Dress Code
  contents:
  - "Dress Code\n   Since attendees must wear their name tags, they must also wear\
    \ shirts\n   or blouses.  Pants or skirts are also highly recommended.  Seriously\n\
    \   though, many newcomers are often embarrassed when they show up Monday\n  \
    \ morning in suits, to discover that everybody else is wearing t-\n   shirts,\
    \ jeans (shorts, if weather permits) and sandals.  There are\n   those in the\
    \ IETF who refuse to wear anything other than suits.\n   Fortunately, they are\
    \ well known (for other reasons) so they are\n   forgiven this particular idiosyncrasy.\
    \  The general rule is \"dress\n   for the weather\" (unless you plan to work\
    \ so hard that you won't go\n   outside, in which case, \"dress for comfort\"\
    \ is the rule!).\n"
- title: Seeing Spots Before Your Eyes
  contents:
  - "Seeing Spots Before Your Eyes\n   Some of the people at the IETF will have a\
    \ little colored dot on\n   their name tag.  A few people have more than one.\
    \  These dots\n   identify people who are silly enough to volunteer to do a lot\
    \ of\n   extra work.  The colors have the following meanings:\n      blue   -\
    \ working group/BOF chair\n      green  - local Host\n      red    - IAB member\n\
    \      yellow - IESG member\n   Local hosts are the people who can answer questions\
    \ about the\n   terminal room, restaurants and points of interest in the area.\n\
    \   Some people have gold stars on their name tags.  The stars indicate\n   that\
    \ those people chaired working groups or BOFs in the IETF area\n   which submitted\
    \ all of its working group/BOF minutes and area report\n   from the previous meeting\
    \ first.  The stars are the Secretariat's way\n   of saying \"thank you\" for\
    \ providing the necessary information\n   quickly.\n   It is important that newcomers\
    \ to the IETF not be afraid to strike up\n   conversations with people who wear\
    \ these dots.  If the IAB and IESG\n   members and working group and BOF chairs\
    \ didn't want to talk to\n   anybody, they wouldn't be wearing the dots in the\
    \ first place.\n   In addition, members of the Secretariat wear blue tinted name\
    \ badges\n   so they can be spotted at a distance.\n   To make life simpler for\
    \ the Secretariat, registration packets are\n   also coded with little colored\
    \ dots.  These are only for Secretariat\n   use, so nobody else needs to worry\
    \ about them.  Please, don't peel\n   them off your packet and put them on your\
    \ name tag.\n"
- title: Terminal Room
  contents:
  - "Terminal Room\n   One of the most important (depending on your point of view)\
    \ things\n   the local host does is provide Internet access to the meeting\n \
    \  attendees.  In general, the connectivity is excellent.  This is\n   entirely\
    \ due to the Olympian efforts of the local hosts, and their\n   ability to beg,\
    \ borrow and steal.  The people and companies who\n   donate their equipment,\
    \ services and time are to be heartily\n   congratulated and thanked.\n   While\
    \ preparation far in advance of the meeting is encouraged, there\n   may be some\
    \ unavoidable \"last minute\" things which can be\n   accomplished in the terminal\
    \ room.  It may also be useful to people\n   who need to make trip reports or\
    \ status reports while things are\n   still fresh in their minds.\n"
- title: Social Event
  contents:
  - "Social Event\n   Another of the most important things organized and managed by\
    \ the\n   local hosts is the IETF social event.  The social event has become\n\
    \   something of a tradition at the IETF meetings.  It has been\n   immortalized\
    \ by Marshal T. Rose with his reference to \"many fine\n   lunches and dinners\"\
    \ [ROSE], and by Claudio and Julia Topolcic with\n   their rendition of \"Nerds\
    \ in Paradise\" on a pink T-shirt.\n   Sometimes, the social event is a computer\
    \ or high-tech related event.\n   At the Boston IETF, for example, the social\
    \ was dinner at the\n   Computer Museum.  Other times, the social might be a dinner\
    \ cruise or\n   a trip to an art gallery.\n   Newcomers to the IETF are encouraged\
    \ to attend the social event.\n   Everyone is encouraged to wear their name tags.\
    \  The social event is\n   designed to give people a chance to meet on a social,\
    \ rather than\n   technical, level.\n"
- title: Agenda
  contents:
  - "Agenda\n   The agenda for the IETF meetings is a very fluid thing.  It is sent,\n\
    \   in various forms, to the IETF announcement list three times prior to\n   the\
    \ meeting.  The final agenda is included in the registration\n   packets.  Of\
    \ course, \"final\" in the IETF doesn't mean the same thing\n   as it does elsewhere\
    \ in the world.  The final agenda is simply the\n   version that went to the printers.\n\
    \   The Secretariat will announce agenda changes during the morning\n   plenary\
    \ sessions.  Changes will also be posted on the bulletin board\n   near the IETF\
    \ registration desk (not the hotel registration desk).\n   Assignments for breakout\
    \ rooms (where the working groups and BOFs\n   meet) and a map showing the room\
    \ locations make up the at-a-glance\n   sheet (included in the registration packets).\
    \  Room assignments are\n   as flexible as the agenda.  Some working groups meet\
    \ multiple times\n   during a meeting and every attempt is made to have a working\
    \ group\n   meet in the same room each session.  Room assignment changes are not\n\
    \   necessarily permanent for the week.  Always check the at-a-glance\n   first,\
    \ then the bulletin board.  When in doubt, check with a member\n   of the Secretariat\
    \ at the registration desk.\n"
- title: Other General Things
  contents:
  - "Other General Things\n   The opening plenary on Monday morning is the most heavily\
    \ attended\n   session.  It is where important introductory remarks are made,\
    \ so\n   people are encouraged to attend.\n   The IETF Secretariat, and IETFers\
    \ in general, are very approachable.\n   Never be afraid to approach someone and\
    \ introduce yourself.  Also,\n   don't be afraid to ask questions, especially\
    \ when it comes to jargon\n   and acronyms!\n   Hallway conversations are very\
    \ important.  A lot of very good work\n   gets done by people who talk together\
    \ between meetings and over\n   lunches and dinners.  Every minute of the IETF\
    \ can be considered work\n   time (much to some people's dismay).\n   A \"bar\
    \ BOF\" is an unofficial get-together, usually in the late\n   evening, during\
    \ which a lot of work gets done over drinks.\n   It's unwise to get between a\
    \ hungry IETFer (and there isn't any other\n   kind) and coffee break brownies\
    \ and cookies, no matter how\n   interesting a hallway conversation is.\n   IETFers\
    \ are fiercely independent.  It's safe to question opinions and\n   offer alternatives,\
    \ but don't expect an IETFer to follow orders.\n   The IETF, and the plenary sessions\
    \ in particular, are not places for\n   vendors to try to sell their wares.  People\
    \ can certainly answer\n   questions about their company and its products, but\

    \ this RFC twice!\n   This is the \"very important registration bullets\" section.\n\
    \   o  To attend an IETF meeting you have to register and you have to pay\n  \
    \    the registration fee.\n   o  All you need to do to be registered is to send\
    \ in a completed\n      registration form.\n   o  You may register by mail, e-mail\
    \ or fax.  Generally, e-mail and\n      fax registration forms will be accepted\
    \ until 13:00 US/Eastern on\n      the Thursday before the meeting.\n   o  You\
    \ may preregister and pay, preregister and pay later,\n      preregister and pay\
    \ on-site, or register and pay on-site.\n   o  To get the lower registration fee,\
    \ you must register by the early\n      registration deadline (about one month\
    \ before the meeting).  You\n      can still pay later or on-site.\n   o  If you\
    \ don't register by the early registration deadline, a late\n      fee is added.\n\
    \   o  Everyone pays the same fees.  There are no educational or group\n     \
    \ discounts.  There are no discounts for attending only part of the\n      week.\n\
    \   o  Register only ONE person per registration form.  Substitutions are\n  \
    \    NOT allowed.\n   o  You may register then pay later, but you may not pay\
    \ then register\n      later.  Payment MUST be accompanied by a completed registration\n\
    \      form.\n   o  Purchase orders are NOT accepted.  DD Form 1556 is accepted.\n\
    \      Invoice for payment cannot be accepted.\n   o  Refunds are subject to a\
    \ US$20 service charge.  Late fees will not\n      be refunded.\n   o  The registration\

- title: Mailing Lists and Archives
  contents:
  - "Mailing Lists and Archives\n   As previously mentioned, the IETF announcement\
    \ and discussion mailing\n   lists are the central mailing lists for IETF activities.\
    \  However,\n   there are many other mailing lists related to IETF work.  For\n\
    \   example, every working group has its own discussion list.  In\n   addition,\
    \ there are some long-term technical debates which have been\n   moved off of\
    \ the IETF list onto lists created specifically for those\n   topics.  It is highly\
    \ recommended that everybody follow the\n   discussions on the mailing lists of\
    \ the working groups which they\n   wish to attend.  The more work that is done\
    \ on the mailing lists, the\n   less work that will need to be done at the meeting,\
    \ leaving time for\n   cross pollination (i.e., attending working groups outside\
    \ one's\n   primary area of interest in order to broaden one's perspective).\n\
    \   The mailing lists also provide a forum for those who wish to follow,\n   or\
    \ contribute to, the working groups' efforts, but cannot attend the\n   IETF meetings.\n\
    \   All IETF discussion lists have a \"-request\" address which handles the\n\
    \   administrative details of joining and leaving the list.  It is\n   generally\
    \ frowned upon when such administrivia appears on the\n   discussion mailing list.\n\
    \   Most IETF discussion lists are archived.  That is, all of the\n   messages\
    \ sent to the list are automatically stored on a host for\n   anonymous FTP access.\
    \  To find out where a particular list is\n   archived, send a message to the\

- title: InterNIC Archives
  contents:
  - "InterNIC Archives\n   There is a tremendous amount of material available for\
    \ those who\n   follow the work of the IETF.  To make it easier to know what to\
    \ read\n   to prepare for a meeting, the InterNIC has established a document\n\
    \   archive.  Beginning about one month prior to an IETF meeting, working\n  \
    \ group/BOF chairs and area directors put documents relevant to the\n   discussions\
    \ to be held into the archives.  Those people who plan to\n   attend a working\
    \ group/BOF session should check the archives for\n   documents which need to\
    \ be read.  The documents are left in the\n   archives for about two months after\
    \ the end of the IETF meeting.\n   On the host \"ds.internic.net\", documents\
    \ are stored in the directory\n   \"/pub/current-ietf-docs\" under subdirectories\
    \ named for each area and\n   then for each working group.  For example, a document\
    \ for the NISI\n   Working Group, which is in the User Services Area, would be\
    \ stored as\n   \"current-ietf-docs/usv/nisi/nisi-doc1.txt\".  Each area will\
    \ also have\n   a subdirectory called \"bof\", where documents to be discussed\
    \ in BOF\n   sessions will be placed.  A directory called \"plenary\" will also\
    \ be\n   created under \"/pub/current-ietf-docs\" to put documents or viewgraphs\n\
    \   related to a plenary session.  Any filename conflicts will be\n   resolved\
    \ by the archive administrator working with the submitter of\n   the document\
    \ via e-mail.\n   It is important to note that the service is provided by the\
    \ InterNIC\n   and that the documents are submitted by the people who work on\
    \ them.\n   The IETF Secretariat does not manage or monitor the archive service.\n\

- title: Be Prepared
  contents:
  - "Be Prepared\n   This topic cannot be stressed enough.  As the IETF grows, it\
    \ becomes\n   more and more important for attendees to arrive prepared for the\n\
    \   working group meetings they plan to attend.  This doesn't apply only\n   to\
    \ newcomers--everybody should come prepared.\n   Being prepared means having read\
    \ the documents which the working\n   group or BOF chair has distributed.  It\
    \ means having followed the\n   discussions on the working group's mailing list\
    \ or having reviewed\n   the archives.  For the working group/BOF chairs, it means\
    \ getting all\n   of the documents out early (i.e., several weeks) to give everybody\n\
    \   time to read them and announcing an agenda and sticking to it.\n   At the\
    \ chair's discretion, some time may be devoted to bringing new\n   working group\
    \ attendees up to speed.  In fact, long lived working\n   groups have occasionally\
    \ held entire sessions which were introductory\n   in nature.  As a rule, however,\
    \ a working group is not the place to\n   go for training.  Observers are always\
    \ welcome, but they must realize\n   that the work effort cannot be delayed for\
    \ education.  Anyone wishing\n   to attend a working group for the first time\
    \ might seek out the chair\n   prior to the meeting and ask for some introduction.\n\
    \   Another thing for everybody to consider is that working groups go\n   through\
    \ phases.  In the initial phase (say, the first two meetings),\n   all ideas are\
    \ welcome.  The idea is to gather all the possible\n   solutions together for\
    \ consideration.  In the development phase, a\n   solution is chosen and developed.\
    \  Trying to reopen issues which were\n   decided more than a couple of meetings\
    \ back is considered bad form.\n   The final phase (the last two meetings) is\
    \ where the \"spit and\n   polish\" are applied to the architected solution. \
    \ This is not the\n   time to suggest architectural changes or open design issues\
    \ already\n   resolved.  It's a bad idea to wait until the last minute to speak\
    \ out\n   if a problem is discovered.  This is especially true for people whose\n\
    \   excuse is that they hadn't read the documents until the day before a\n   comments\
    \ period ended.\n   Time at the IETF meetings is a precious thing.  Working groups\
    \ are\n   encouraged to meet between IETF meetings, either in person or by\n \
    \  video or telephone conference.  Doing as much work as possible over\n   the\
    \ mailing lists would also reduce the amount of work which must be\n   done at\
    \ the meeting.\n"
- title: RFCs and Internet-Drafts
  contents:
  - "RFCs and Internet-Drafts\n   Originally, RFCs were just what the name implies:\
    \  requests for\n   comments.  The early RFCs were messages between the ARPANET\n\
    \   architects about how to resolve certain problems.  Over the years,\n   RFCs\
    \ became more formal.  It reached the point that they were being\n   cited as\
    \ standards, even when they weren't.\n   To help clear up some confusion, there\
    \ are now two special sub-series\n   within the RFCs: FYIs and STDs.  The For\
    \ Your Information RFC sub-\n   series was created to document overviews and topics\
    \ which are\n   introductory.  Frequently, FYIs are created by groups within the\
    \ IETF\n   User Services Area.  The STD RFC sub-series was created to identify\n\
    \   those RFCs which do in fact specify Internet standards.\n   Every RFC, including\
    \ FYIs and STDs, have an RFC number by which they\n   are indexed and by which\
    \ they can be retrieved.  FYIs and STDs have\n   FYI numbers and STD numbers,\
    \ respectively, in addition to RFC\n   numbers.  This makes it easier for a new\
    \ Internet user, for example,\n   to find all of the helpful, informational documents\
    \ by looking for\n   the FYIs amongst all the RFCs.  If an FYI or STD is revised,\
    \ its RFC\n   number will change, but its FYI or STD number will remain constant\n\
    \   for ease of reference.\n   There is also an RTR subseries of RFCs for Reseaux\
    \ Associes pour la\n   Recherche Europeenne (RARE) Technical Reports.  These are\
    \ technical\n   reports developed in the RARE community that are published as\
    \ RFCs to\n   provide easy access to the general Internet community.\n   Internet-Drafts\
    \ are working documents of the IETF.  Any group or\n   individual may submit a\
    \ document for distribution as an Internet-\n   Draft.  These documents are valid\
    \ for six months, and may be updated,\n   replaced or obsoleted at any time. \
    \ Guidelines require that an\n   expiration date appear on every page of an Internet-Draft.\
    \  It is not\n   appropriate to use Internet-Drafts as reference material or to\
    \ cite\n   them, other than as \"working drafts\" or \"works in progress.\"\n\
    \   For additional information, read the following documents:\n   o  Request for\
