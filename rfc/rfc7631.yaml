  - "1.  Introduction\n   This document reorganizes and rationalizes the naming of\
    \ TLVs (type-\n   length-value structures) defined by [RFC5444] and recorded by\
    \ IANA in\n   the following subregistries of the \"Mobile Ad hoc NETwork (MANET)\n\
    \   Parameters\" registry: \"Packet TLV Types\", \"Message TLV Types\", and\n\
    \   \"Address Block TLV Types\".\n   This document reorganizes the naming of already-allocated\
    \ Packet,\n   Message, and Address Block TLV types, and their corresponding type\n\
    \   extensions.  It also updates the corresponding IANA registries.\n   TLVs have\
    \ a type (one octet) and a type extension (one octet) that\n   together form a\
    \ full type (of two octets).  A TLV may omit the type\n   extension when it is\
    \ zero.  However, that applies only to its\n   representation; it still has a\
    \ type extension of zero.  A TLV type\n   defines an IANA registry of type extensions\
    \ for that type.\n   There have been two forms of TLV allocation.\n   The first,\
    \ but less common, form of allocation has been that\n   allocation of the TLV\
    \ type has defined (but not necessarily\n   allocated) all the type extensions\
    \ for that TLV type.  This applies,\n   for example, to the Address Block TLV\
    \ LINK_METRIC specified in\n   [RFC7181].  The LINK_METRIC type extensions are\
    \ all available for\n   allocation for different definitions of link metric. \
    \ It is\n   appropriate in this case to apply the name LINK_METRIC to the type,\n\
    \   and also to all the full types corresponding to that type, as has\n   been\
    \ done.  Type extensions can then be individually named or can be\n   simply referred\
    \ to by their number.\n   The second, more common, form of allocation has been\
    \ that allocation\n   of the TLV type has defined only type extension 0, and possibly\
    \ type\n   extension 1, for that TLV type.  An example is the Address Block TLV\n\
    \   LINK_STATUS defined in [RFC6130], where only type extension 0 is\n   allocated.\
    \  It is not reasonable to assume that the remaining 255\n   type extensions will\
    \ be allocated to forms of LINK_STATUS.  (Other\n   forms of link status are already\
    \ catered to by the introduction, in\n   [RFC7188], of a registry for values of\
    \ the LINK_STATUS TLV.)  Thus,\n   the name LINK_STATUS should be attached to\
    \ the specific type\n   extension for that type, i.e., to the full type and not\
    \ to the TLV\n   type when used with any other type extensions.  This was, however,\n\
    \   not done as part of the initial registration of this TLV type.\n   Effectively,\
    \ this leaves, for the LINK_STATUS TLV type, the type\n   extensions 1-255 either\
    \ unavailable for allocation (if applying\n   strictly the interpretation that\
    \ they must relate to a LINK_STATUS)\n   or counterintuitively named for their\
    \ intended function.\n   The purpose of this document is to change how names of\
    \ the second\n   form are applied and recorded in IANA registries, and to provide\n\
    \   guidelines and instructions for future TLV type allocations.  This is\n  \
    \ to facilitate the addition of new TLVs using type extensions other\n   than\
    \ 0, but without them having inappropriate names attached.  So,\n   for example,\
    \ LINK_STATUS will become the name of the full type\n   (composed of the TLV type\
    \ 3 and the TLV type extension 0) and will\n   cease being the name of the TLV\
    \ type 3.  This leaves the question of\n   how to name the type.  As it is not\
    \ clear what other TLVs might be\n   defined for other type extensions of the\
    \ same type, the type is\n   currently left unnamed and specified only by number.\n\
    \   This document also updates the Expert Review guidelines from\n   [RFC5444],\
    \ so as to establish a policy for consistent naming of\n   future TLV type and\
    \ type extension allocations.\n   For clarity, all currently allocated TLVs in\
    \ [RFC5497], [RFC6130],\n   [RFC6621], [RFC7181], and [RFC7182] are listed in\
    \ the IANA\n   Considerations section of this document, each specifying the updates\n\
    \   or indicating no change when that is appropriate (such as the\n   LINK_METRIC\
    \ TLV and both TLVs defined in [RFC6621]).  The only\n   changes are of naming.\n\
    \   Note that nothing in this document changes the operation of any\n   protocol.\
    \  This naming is already used, in effect, in [RFC6130] and\n   [RFC7181], currently\
    \ the main users of allocated TLVs.  For example,\n   the former indicates that\
    \ all usage of LINK_STATUS refers to that TLV\n   with type extension 0.\n"

    \ guidelines for\n   allocations in [RFC5444] in the \"Packet TLV Types\", \"\

  contents:
  - "3.1.  Expert Review: Evaluation Guidelines\n   For registration in the \"Packet\
    \ TLV Types\", \"Message TLV Types\", and\n   \"Address Block TLV Types\" registries,\
    \ the following guidelines apply,\n   in addition to those given in Section 6.1\
    \ in [RFC5444]:\n   o  If the requested TLV type immediately defines (but not\
    \ necessarily\n      allocates) all the corresponding type extensions for versions\
    \ of\n      that type, then a common name SHOULD be assigned for the TLV type.\n\
    \      This case is unchanged by this specification.  This currently\n      includes\
    \ TLV types named ICV, TIMESTAMP, and LINK_METRIC; it also\n      includes the\
    \ HELLO Message-Type-specific TLVs defined in\n      [RFC6621].\n   o  Otherwise,\
    \ if the requested TLV type does not immediately define\n      all the corresponding\
    \ type extensions for versions of that type,\n      then a common name SHOULD\
    \ NOT be assigned for that TLV type.\n      Instead, it is RECOMMENDED that:\n\
    \      *  The \"description\" for the allocated TLV type be \"Defined by\n   \
    \      Type Extension\".\n      *  For Packet TLV Types, the type extension registry,\
    \ created for\n         the TLV type, be named \"Type XX Packet TLV Type Extensions\"\
    ,\n         with XX replaced by the numerical value of the TLV type.\n      *\
    \  For Message TLV Types, the type extension registry, created for\n         the\
    \ TLV type, be named \"Type XX Message TLV Type Extensions\",\n         with XX\
    \ replaced by the numerical value of the TLV type.\n      *  For Address Block\
    \ TLV Types, the type extension registry,\n         created for the TLV type,\
    \ be named \"Type XX Address Block TLV\n         Type Extensions\", with XX replaced\
    \ by the numerical value of\n         the TLV type.\n      *  When a new type\
    \ extension is required, unless there are reasons\n         to the contrary, the\
    \ next consecutive type extension is\n         allocated and given a name.  (Reasons\
    \ to the contrary MAY\n         include maintaining a correspondence between corresponding\n\
    \         Packet, Message, and Address Block TLVs, and reserving type\n      \
    \   extension zero if not yet allocated.)\n"
