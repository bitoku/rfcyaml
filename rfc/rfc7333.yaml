- title: 1.  Introduction

  - "1.  Introduction\n   In the past decade, a fair number of network-layer mobility\
    \ protocols\n   have been standardized [RFC6275] [RFC5944] [RFC5380] [RFC6301]\n\
    \   [RFC5213].  Although these protocols differ in terms of functions and\n  \
    \ associated message formats, they all employ a mobility anchor to\n   allow a\
    \ mobile node to remain reachable after it has moved to a\n   different network.\
    \  Among other tasks that the anchor point performs,\n   the anchor point ensures\
    \ connectivity by forwarding packets destined\n   to, or sent from, the mobile\
    \ node.  It is a centrally deployed\n   mobility anchor in the sense that the\
    \ deployed architectures today\n   have a small number of these anchors and the\
    \ traffic of millions of\n   mobile nodes in an operator network is typically\
    \ managed by the same\n   anchor.  Such a mobility anchor may still have to reside\
    \ in the\n   subscriber's provider network even when the subscriber is roaming\
    \ to\n   a visited network, in order that certain functions such as charging\n\
    \   and billing can be performed more readily by the provider's network.\n   An\
    \ example provider network is a Third Generation Partnership Project\n   (3GPP)\
    \ network.\n   Distributed mobility management (DMM) is an alternative to the\
    \ above-\n   mentioned centralized deployment.  The background behind the interest\n\
    \   in studying DMM is primarily as follows.\n   (1)  More than ever, mobile users\
    \ are consuming Internet content,\n        including that of local Content Delivery\
    \ Networks (CDNs).  Such\n        traffic imposes new requirements on mobile core\
    \ networks for\n        data traffic delivery.  To prevent exceeding the available\
    \ core\n        network capacity, service providers need to implement new\n  \
    \      strategies such as selective IPv4 traffic offload (e.g.,\n        [RFC6909],\
    \ 3GPP Local IP Access (LIPA) and Selected IP Traffic\n        Offload (SIPTO)\
    \ work items [TS.23.401]) through alternative\n        access networks such as\
    \ Wireless Local Area Networks (WLANs)\n        [MOB-DATA-OFFLOAD].  In addition,\
    \ a gateway selection mechanism\n        takes user proximity into account within\
    \ the Evolved Packet Core\n        (EPC) [TS.29.303].  However, these mechanisms\
    \ were not pursued\n        in the past, owing to charging and billing considerations\
    \ that\n        require solutions beyond the mobility protocol.  Consequently,\n\
    \        assigning a gateway anchor node from a visited network when\n       \
    \ roaming to the visited network has only recently been done and\n        is limited\
    \ to voice services.\n        Both traffic offloading and CDN mechanisms could\
    \ benefit from\n        the development of mobile architectures with fewer hierarchical\n\
    \        levels introduced into the data path by the mobility management\n   \
    \     system.  This trend of \"flattening\" the mobile networks works\n      \
    \  best for direct communications among peers in the same\n        geographical\
    \ area.  Distributed mobility management in the\n        flattening mobile networks\
    \ would anchor the traffic closer to\n        the point of attachment of the user.\n\
    \   (2)  Today's mobile networks present service providers with new\n        challenges.\
    \  Mobility patterns indicate that mobile nodes often\n        remain attached\
    \ to the same point of attachment for considerable\n        periods of time [LOCATING-USER].\
    \  Specific IP mobility\n        management support is not required for applications\
    \ that launch\n        and complete their sessions while the mobile node is connected\n\
    \        to the same point of attachment.  However, IP mobility support\n    \
    \    is currently designed for always-on operation, maintaining all\n        parameters\
    \ of the context for each mobile subscriber for as long\n        as they are connected\
    \ to the network.  This can result in a\n        waste of resources and unnecessary\
    \ costs for the service\n        provider.  Infrequent node mobility coupled with\
    \ application\n        intelligence suggest that mobility support could be provided\n\
    \        selectively, e.g., as described in [DHCPv6-CLASS-BASED-PREFIX]\n    \
    \    and [IPv6-PREFIX-PROPERTIES], thus reducing the amount of\n        context\
    \ maintained in the network.\n   DMM may distribute the mobility anchors in the\
    \ data plane in\n   flattening the mobility network such that the mobility anchors\
    \ are\n   positioned closer to the user; ideally, mobility agents could be\n \
    \  collocated with the first-hop router.  Facilitated by the\n   distribution\
    \ of mobility anchors, it may be possible to selectively\n   use or not use mobility\
    \ protocol support, depending on whether such\n   support is needed or not.  DMM\
    \ can thus reduce the amount of state\n   information that must be maintained\
    \ in various mobility agents of the\n   mobile network and can then avoid the\
    \ unnecessary establishment of\n   mechanisms to forward traffic from an old mobility\
    \ anchor to a new\n   mobility anchor.\n   This document compares distributed\
    \ mobility management with\n   centralized mobility management in Section 3. \
    \ The problems that can\n   be addressed with DMM are summarized in Section 4.\
    \  The mandatory\n   requirements as well as the optional requirements for network-layer\n\
    \   distributed mobility management are given in Section 5.  Security\n   considerations\
    \ are mentioned in Section 6.\n   The problem statement and use cases [DMM-SCENARIO]\
    \ can be found in\n   [DIST-MOB-REVIEW].\n"

- title: 3.  Centralized versus Distributed Mobility Management
  contents:
  - "3.  Centralized versus Distributed Mobility Management\n   Mobility management\
    \ is needed because the IP address of a mobile node\n   may change as the node\
    \ moves.  Mobility management functions may be\n   implemented at different layers\
    \ of the protocol stack.  At the IP\n   (network) layer, mobility management can\
    \ be client-based or\n   network-based.\n   An IP-layer mobility management protocol\
    \ is typically based on the\n   principle of distinguishing between a session\
    \ identifier and a\n   forwarding address and maintaining a mapping between the\
    \ two.  In\n   Mobile IP, the new IP address of the mobile node after the node\
    \ has\n   moved is the forwarding address, whereas the original IP address\n \
    \  before the mobile node moves serves as the session identifier.  The\n   location\
    \ management (LM) information is kept by associating the\n   forwarding address\
    \ with the session identifier.  Packets addressed to\n   the session identifier\
    \ will first route to the original network,\n   which redirects them using the\
    \ forwarding address to deliver to the\n   session.  Redirecting packets this\
    \ way can result in long routes.  An\n   existing optimization routes directly,\
    \ using the forwarding address\n   of the host, and as such is a host-based solution.\n\
    \   The next two subsections explain centralized and distributed mobility\n  \
    \ management functions in the network.\n"
- title: 3.1.  Centralized Mobility Management
  contents:
  - "3.1.  Centralized Mobility Management\n   In centralized mobility management,\
    \ the location information in terms\n   of a mapping between the session identifier\
    \ and the forwarding\n   address is kept at a single mobility anchor, and packets\
    \ destined to\n   the session identifier are forwarded via this anchor.  In other\n\
    \   words, such mobility management systems are centralized in both the\n   control\
    \ plane and the data plane (mobile node IP traffic).\n   Many existing mobility\
    \ management deployments make use of centralized\n   mobility anchoring in a hierarchical\
    \ network architecture, as shown\n   in Figure 1.  Examples are the home agent\
    \ (HA) and local mobility\n   anchor (LMA) serving as the anchors for the mobile\
    \ node (MN) and\n   mobile access gateway (MAG) in Mobile IPv6 [RFC6275] and in\
    \ Proxy\n   Mobile IPv6 [RFC5213], respectively.  Cellular networks, such as 3GPP\n\
    \   General Packet Radio System (GPRS) networks and 3GPP Evolved Packet\n   System\
    \ (EPS) networks, also employ centralized mobility management.\n   In the 3GPP\
    \ GPRS network, the Gateway GPRS Support Node (GGSN),\n   Serving GPRS Support\
    \ Node (SGSN), and Radio Network Controller (RNC)\n   constitute a hierarchy of\
    \ anchors.  In the 3GPP EPS network, the\n   Packet Data Network Gateway (P-GW)\
    \ and Serving Gateway (S-GW)\n   constitute another hierarchy of anchors.\n  \

    \   in [PMIP-CP-UP-SPLIT].  While mobility management can be distributed,\n  \
    \ it is not necessary for other functions such as subscription\n   management,\

    \ distributed.\n   A distributed mobility management scheme for a flattening mobile\n\

- title: 4.  Problem Statement
  contents:
  - "4.  Problem Statement\n   The problems that can be addressed with DMM are summarized\
    \ as\n   follows:\n   PS1:  Non-optimal routes\n         Forwarding via a centralized\
    \ anchor often results in\n         non-optimal routes, thereby increasing the\
    \ end-to-end delay.\n         The problem is manifested, for example, when accessing\
    \ a nearby\n         server or servers of a Content Delivery Network (CDN), or\
    \ when\n         receiving locally available IP multicast packets or sending IP\n\
    \         multicast packets.  (Existing route optimization is only a\n       \
    \  host-based solution.  On the other hand, localized routing with\n         PMIPv6\
    \ [RFC6705] addresses only a part of the problem where\n         both the MN and\
    \ the correspondent node (CN) are attached to the\n         same MAG, and it is\
    \ not applicable when the CN does not behave\n         like an MN.)\n   PS2: \
    \ Divergence from other evolutionary trends in network\n         architectures\
    \ such as distribution of content delivery\n         Mobile networks have generally\
    \ been evolving towards a flatter\n         and flatter network.  Centralized\
    \ mobility management, which is\n         non-optimal with a flatter network architecture,\
    \ does not\n         support this evolution.\n   PS3:  Lack of scalability of\
    \ centralized tunnel management and\n         mobility context maintenance\n \
    \        Setting up tunnels through a central anchor and maintaining\n       \
    \  mobility context for each MN usually requires more concentrated\n         resources\
    \ in a centralized design, thus reducing scalability.\n         Distributing the\
    \ tunnel maintenance function and the mobility\n         context maintenance function\
    \ among different network entities\n         with proper signaling protocol design\
    \ can avoid increasing the\n         concentrated resources with an increasing\
    \ number of MNs.\n   PS4:  Single point of failure and attack\n         Centralized\
    \ anchoring designs may be more vulnerable to a\n         single point of failure\
    \ and attacks than a distributed system.\n         The impact of a successful\
    \ attack on a system with centralized\n         mobility management can be far\
    \ greater as well.\n   PS5:  Unnecessary mobility support to clients that do not\
    \ need it\n         IP mobility support is usually provided to all MNs.  However,\n\
    \         it is not always required, and not every parameter of mobility\n   \
    \      context is always used.  For example, some applications or\n         nodes\
    \ do not need a stable IP address during a handover to\n         maintain session\
    \ continuity.  Sometimes, the entire application\n         session runs while\
    \ the MN does not change the point of\n         attachment.  Besides, some sessions,\
    \ e.g., SIP-based sessions,\n         can handle mobility at the application layer\
    \ and hence do not\n         need IP mobility support; it is then unnecessary\
    \ to provide IP\n         mobility support for such sessions.\n   PS6:  Mobility\
    \ signaling overhead with peer-to-peer communication\n         Resources may be\
    \ wasted when mobility signaling (e.g.,\n         maintenance of the tunnel, keep-alive\
    \ signaling, etc.) is not\n         turned off for peer-to-peer communication.\n\
    \   PS7:  Deployment with multiple mobility solutions\n         There are already\
    \ many variants and extensions of MIP as well\n         as mobility solutions\
    \ at other layers.  Deployment of new\n         mobility management solutions\
    \ can be challenging, and debugging\n         difficult, when they coexist with\
    \ solutions already deployed in\n         the field.\n   PS8:  Duplicate multicast\
    \ traffic\n         IP multicast distribution over architectures using IP mobility\n\
    \         solutions (e.g., [RFC6224]) may lead to convergence of\n         duplicated\
    \ multicast subscriptions towards the downstream\n         tunnel entity (e.g.,\
    \ MAG in PMIPv6).  Concretely, when\n         multicast subscription for individual\
    \ mobile nodes is coupled\n         with mobility tunnels (e.g., a PMIPv6 tunnel),\
    \ duplicate\n         multicast subscription(s) is prone to be received through\n\
    \         different upstream paths.  This problem may also exist or be\n     \
    \    more severe in a distributed mobility environment.\n"

  - "5.  Requirements\n   Now that distributed mobility management has been compared\
    \ with\n   centralized deployment (Section 3) and the problems have been\n   described\
    \ (Section 4), this section identifies the following\n   requirements:\n   REQ1:\
    \  Distributed mobility management\n          IP mobility, network access solutions,\
    \ and forwarding\n          solutions provided by DMM MUST enable traffic to avoid\n\
    \          traversing a single mobility anchor far from the optimal\n        \
    \  route.\n          This requirement on distribution applies to the data plane\n\
    \          only.  It does not impose constraints on whether the control\n    \
    \      plane should be distributed or centralized.  However, if the\n        \
    \  control plane is centralized while the data plane is\n          distributed,\
    \ it is implied that the control plane and data\n          plane need to separate\
    \ (Section 3.2).\n          Motivation: This requirement is motivated by current\
    \ trends in\n          network evolution: (a) it is cost- and resource-effective\
    \ to\n          cache contents, and the caching (e.g., CDN) servers are\n    \
    \      distributed so that each user in any location can be close to\n       \
    \   one of the servers; (b) the significantly larger number of\n          mobile\
    \ nodes and flows call for improved scalability; (c)\n          single points\
    \ of failure are avoided in a distributed system;\n          and (d) threats against\
    \ centrally deployed anchors, e.g., a\n          home agent and a local mobility\
    \ anchor, are mitigated in a\n          distributed system.\n          This requirement\
    \ addresses the problems PS1, PS2, PS3, and PS4\n          described in Section\
    \ 4.\n   REQ2:  Bypassable network-layer mobility support for each application\n\
    \          session\n          DMM solutions MUST enable network-layer mobility,\
    \ but it MUST\n          be possible for any individual active application session\n\
    \          (flow) to not use it.  Mobility support is needed, for\n          example,\
    \ when a mobile host moves and an application cannot\n          cope with a change\
    \ in the IP address.  Mobility support is\n          also needed when a mobile\
    \ router changes its IP address as it\n          moves together with a host and,\
    \ in the presence of ingress\n          filtering, an application in the host\
    \ is interrupted.\n          However, mobility support at the network layer is\
    \ not always\n          needed; a mobile node can often be stationary, and mobility\n\
    \          support can also be provided at other layers.  It is then not\n   \
    \       always necessary to maintain a stable IP address or prefix for\n     \
    \     an active application session.\n          Different active sessions can\
    \ also differ in whether network-\n          layer mobility support is needed.\
    \  IP mobility, network access\n          solutions, and forwarding solutions\
    \ provided by DMM MUST then\n          provide the possibility of independent\
    \ handling for each\n          application session of a user or mobile device.\n\
    \          The handling of mobility management to the granularity of an\n    \
    \      individual session of a user/device SHOULD need proper session\n      \
    \    identification in addition to user/device identification.\n          Motivation:\
    \ The motivation of this requirement is to enable\n          more efficient forwarding\
    \ and more efficient use of network\n          resources by selecting an IP address\
    \ or prefix according to\n          whether mobility support is needed and by\
    \ not maintaining\n          context at the mobility anchor when there is no such\
    \ need.\n          This requirement addresses the problems PS5 and PS6 described\n\
    \          in Section 4.\n   REQ3:  IPv6 deployment\n          DMM solutions SHOULD\
    \ target IPv6 as the primary deployment\n          environment and SHOULD NOT\
    \ be tailored specifically to support\n          IPv4, particularly in situations\
    \ where private IPv4 addresses\n          and/or NATs are used.\n          Motivation:\
    \ This requirement conforms to the general\n          orientation of IETF work.\
    \  DMM deployment is foreseen as \"on\n          the mid- to long-term horizon\"\
    , when IPv6 is expected to be\n          far more common than today.\n       \
    \   This requirement avoids the unnecessarily complex solution of\n          trying\
    \ to provide the same level of functionality to both IPv4\n          and IPv6.\
    \  Some of the IPv6-specific features are not\n          available for IPv4.\n\
    \   REQ4:  Existing mobility protocols\n          A DMM solution MUST first consider\
    \ reusing and extending IETF\n          standard protocols before specifying new\
    \ protocols.\n          Motivation: Reuse of existing IETF work is more efficient\
    \ and\n          less error-prone.\n          This requirement attempts to avoid\
    \ the need for development of\n          new protocols and therefore their potential\
    \ for being time-\n          consuming and error-prone.\n   REQ5:  Coexistence\
    \ with deployed networks/hosts and operability\n          across different networks\n\
    \          A DMM solution may require loose, tight, or no integration\n      \
    \    into existing mobility protocols and host IP stacks.\n          Regardless\
    \ of the integration level, DMM implementations MUST\n          be able to coexist\
    \ with existing network deployments, end\n          hosts, and routers that may\
    \ or may not implement existing\n          mobility protocols.  Furthermore, a\
    \ DMM solution SHOULD work\n          across different networks, possibly operated\
    \ as separate\n          administrative domains, when the needed mobility management\n\
    \          signaling, forwarding, and network access are allowed by the\n    \
    \      trust relationship between them.\n          Motivation: to (a) preserve\
    \ backwards compatibility so that\n          existing networks and hosts are not\
    \ affected and continue to\n          function as usual, and (b) enable inter-domain\
    \ operation if\n          desired.\n          This requirement addresses the problem\
    \ PS7 described in\n          Section 4.\n   REQ6:  Operation and management considerations\n\
    \          A DMM solution needs to consider configuring a device,\n          monitoring\
    \ the current operational state of a device, and\n          responding to events\
    \ that impact the device, possibly by\n          modifying the configuration and\
    \ storing the data in a format\n          that can be analyzed later.  Different\
    \ management protocols\n          are available.  For example:\n          (a)\
    \  the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) [RFC1157],\n               with\
    \ definitions of standardized management information\n               base (MIB)\
    \ objects for DMM that allow the monitoring of\n               traffic steering\
    \ in a consistent manner across different\n               devices\n          (b)\
    \  the Network Configuration Protocol (NETCONF) [RFC6241],\n               with\
    \ definitions of standardized YANG [RFC6020] modules\n               for DMM to\
    \ achieve a standardized configuration\n          (c)  syslog [RFC5424], which\
    \ is a one-way protocol allowing a\n               device to report significant\
    \ events to a log analyzer in\n               a network management system\n  \
    \        (d)  the IP Flow Information Export (IPFIX) Protocol, which\n       \
    \        serves as a means for transmitting traffic flow\n               information\
    \ over the network [RFC7011], with a formal\n               description of IPFIX\
    \ Information Elements [RFC7012]\n          It is not the goal of this requirements\
    \ document to impose\n          which management protocol(s) should be used. \
    \ An inventory of\n          the management protocols and data models is covered\
    \ in\n          [RFC6632].\n          The following paragraphs list the operation\
    \ and management\n          considerations required for a DMM solution; this list\
    \ of\n          considerations may not be exhaustive and may be expanded\n   \
    \       according to the needs of the solutions:\n          A DMM solution MUST\
    \ describe how, and in what types of\n          environments, it can be scalably\
    \ deployed and managed.\n          A DMM solution MUST support mechanisms to test\
    \ whether the DMM\n          solution is working properly.  For example, when\
    \ a DMM\n          solution employs traffic indirection to support a mobility\n\
    \          session, implementations MUST support mechanisms to test that\n   \
    \       the appropriate traffic indirection operations are in place,\n       \
    \   including the setup of traffic indirection and the subsequent\n          teardown\
    \ of the indirection to release the associated network\n          resources when\
    \ the mobility session has closed.\n          A DMM solution SHOULD expose the\
    \ operational state of DMM to\n          the administrators of the DMM entities.\
    \  For example, when a\n          DMM solution employs separation between a session\
    \ identifier\n          and forwarding address, it should expose the association\n\
    \          between them.\n          When flow mobility is supported by a DMM solution,\
    \ the\n          solution SHOULD support means to correlate the flow routing\n\
    \          policies and the observed forwarding actions.\n          A DMM solution\
    \ SHOULD support mechanisms to check the liveness\n          of a forwarding path.\
    \  If the DMM solution sends periodic\n          update refresh messages to configure\
    \ the forwarding path, the\n          refresh period SHOULD be configurable and\
    \ a reasonable default\n          configuration value proposed.  Information collected\
    \ can be\n          logged or made available with protocols such as SNMP\n   \
    \       [RFC1157], NETCONF [RFC6241], IPFIX [RFC7011], or syslog\n          [RFC5424].\n\
    \          A DMM solution MUST provide fault management and monitoring\n     \
    \     mechanisms to manage situations where an update of the\n          mobility\
    \ session or the data path fails.  The system must also\n          be able to\
    \ handle situations where a mobility anchor with\n          ongoing mobility sessions\
    \ fails.\n          A DMM solution SHOULD be able to monitor usage of the DMM\n\
    \          protocol.  When a DMM solution uses an existing protocol, the\n   \
    \       techniques already defined for that protocol SHOULD be used to\n     \
    \     monitor the DMM operation.  When these techniques are\n          inadequate,\
    \ new techniques MUST be developed.\n          In particular, the DMM solution\
    \ SHOULD\n          (a)  be able to monitor the number of mobility sessions per\n\
    \               user, as well as their average duration\n          (b)  provide\
    \ an indication of DMM performance, such as\n               (1)  handover delay,\
    \ which includes the time necessary to\n                    reestablish the forwarding\
    \ path when the point of\n                    attachment changes\n           \
    \    (2)  protocol reactivity, which is the time between\n                   \
    \ handover events such as the attachment to a new\n                    access\
    \ point and the completion of the mobility\n                    session update\n\
    \          (c)  provide means to measure the signaling cost of the DMM\n     \
    \          protocol\n          (d)  if tunneling is used for traffic redirection,\
    \ monitor\n               (1)  the number of tunnels\n               (2)  their\
    \ transmission and reception information\n               (3)  the encapsulation\
    \ method used, and its overhead\n               (4)  the security used at the\
    \ node level\n          DMM solutions SHOULD support standardized configuration\
    \ with\n          NETCONF [RFC6241], using YANG [RFC6020] modules, which SHOULD\n\
    \          be created for DMM when needed for such configuration.\n          However,\
    \ if a DMM solution creates extensions to MIPv6 or\n          PMIPv6, the allowed\
    \ addition of definitions of management\n          information base (MIB) objects\
    \ to the MIPv6 MIB [RFC4295] or\n          the PMIPv6 MIB [RFC6475] that are needed\
    \ for the control and\n          monitoring of the protocol extensions SHOULD\
    \ be limited to\n          read-only objects.\n          Motivation: A DMM solution\
    \ that is designed from the beginning\n          for operability and manageability\
    \ can implement efficient\n          operations and management solutions.\n  \
    \        These requirements avoid DMM designs that make operations and\n     \
    \     management difficult or costly.\n   REQ7:  Security considerations\n   \
    \       A DMM solution MUST support any security protocols and\n          mechanisms\
    \ needed to secure the network and to make continuous\n          security improvements.\
    \  In addition, with security taken into\n          consideration early in the\
    \ design, a DMM solution MUST NOT\n          introduce new security risks or amplify\
    \ existing security\n          risks that cannot be mitigated by existing security\
    \ protocols\n          and mechanisms.\n          Motivation: Various attacks\
    \ such as impersonation, denial of\n          service, man-in-the-middle attacks,\
    \ and so on may be launched\n          in a DMM deployment.  For instance, an\
    \ illegitimate node may\n          attempt to access a network providing DMM.\
    \  Another example is\n          that a malicious node can forge a number of signaling\n\
    \          messages, thus redirecting traffic from its legitimate path.\n    \
    \      Consequently, the specific node or nodes to which the traffic\n       \
    \   is redirected may be under a denial-of-service attack and\n          other\
    \ nodes do not receive their traffic.  Accordingly,\n          security mechanisms/protocols\
    \ providing access control,\n          integrity, authentication, authorization,\
    \ confidentiality,\n          etc. should be used to protect the DMM entities\
    \ as they are\n          already used to protect existing networks and existing\n\
    \          mobility protocols defined in the IETF.  However, if a\n          candidate\
    \ DMM solution is such that these existing security\n          mechanisms/protocols\
    \ are unable to provide sufficient security\n          protection even when properly\
    \ used, then that candidate DMM\n          solution is causing uncontrollable\
    \ security problems.\n          This requirement prevents a DMM solution from\
    \ introducing\n          uncontrollable problems of potentially insecure mobility\n\
    \          management protocols that make deployment infeasible, because\n   \
    \       platforms conforming to such protocols are at risk for data\n        \
    \  loss and numerous other dangers, including financial harm to\n          the\
    \ users.\n   REQ8:  Multicast considerations\n          DMM SHOULD enable multicast\
    \ solutions to be developed to avoid\n          network inefficiency in multicast\
    \ traffic delivery.\n          Motivation: Existing multicast deployments have\
    \ been\n          introduced after completing the design of the reference\n  \
    \        mobility protocol, often leading to network inefficiency and\n      \
    \    non-optimal forwarding for the multicast traffic.  DMM should\n         \
    \ instead consider multicast early in the process, so that the\n          multicast\
    \ solutions can better consider the efficient nature\n          of multicast traffic\
    \ delivery (such as duplicate multicast\n          subscriptions towards the downstream\
    \ tunnel entities).  The\n          multicast solutions should then avoid restricting\
    \ the\n          management of all IP multicast traffic to a single host\n   \
    \       through a dedicated (tunnel) interface on multicast-capable\n        \
    \  access routers.\n          This requirement addresses the problems PS1 and\
    \ PS8 described\n          in Section 4.\n"
