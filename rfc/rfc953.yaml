  - "STATUS OF THIS MEMO\n   This RFC is the official specification of the Hostname\
    \ Server\n   Protocol.  This edition of the specification includes minor revisions\n\
    \   to RFC 811 which brings it up to date.  Distribution of this memo is\n   unlimited.\n"
- title: INTRODUCTION
  contents:
  - "INTRODUCTION\n   The NIC Internet Hostname Server is a TCP-based host information\n\
    \   program and protocol running on the SRI-NIC machine.  It is one of a\n   series\
    \ of internet name services maintained by the DDN Network\n   Information Center\
    \ (NIC) at SRI International on behalf of the\n   Defense Communications Agency\
    \ (DCA).  The function of this particular\n   server is to deliver machine-readable\
    \ name/address information\n   describing networks, gateways, hosts, and eventually\
    \ domains, within\n   the internet environment.  As currently implemented, the\
    \ server\n   provides the information outlined in the DoD Internet Host Table\n\
    \   Specification [See RFC-952].  For a discussion of future developments\n  \
    \ see also RFC-921 concerning the Domain Name System.\n"
- title: PROTOCOL
  contents:
  - "PROTOCOL\n   To access this server from a program, establish a TCP connection\
    \ to\n   port 101 (decimal) at the service host, SRI-NIC.ARPA (26.0.0.73 or\n\
    \   10.0.0.51).  Send the information request (a single line), and read\n   the\
    \ resulting response.  The connection is closed by the server upon\n   completion\
    \ of the response, so only one request can be made for each\n   connection.\n"
- title: QUERY/RESPONSE FORMAT
  contents:
  - "QUERY/RESPONSE FORMAT\n   The name server accepts simple text query requests\
    \ of the form\n      <command key> <argument(s)> [<options>]\n   where square\
    \ brackets (\"[]\") indicate an optional field.  The command\n   key is a keyword\
    \ indicating the nature of the request.  The defined\n   keys are explained below.\n\
    \   The response, on the other hand, is of the form\n      <response key> : <rest\
    \ of response>\n"

    \ the\n   response, and the rest of the response is interpreted in the context\n\
    \   of the key.\n   NOTE:  Care should be taken to interpret the nature of the\
    \ reply\n   (e.g, single record or multiple record), so that no confusion about\n\
    \   the state of the reply results.  An \"ALL\" request will likely return\n \
    \  several hundred or more records of all types, whereas \"HNAME\" or\n   \"HADDR\"\
    \ will usually return one HOST record.\n"

    \ entries that match\n   the name.  For example:\n      HNAME SRI-NIC.ARPA <CRLF>\n\
    \         where <CRLF> is a carriage return/ linefeed, and 'SRI-NIC.ARPA'\n  \
    \       is a host name\n      The likely response is:\n      HOST : 26.0.0.73,\
    \ 10.0.0.51 : SRI-NIC.ARPA,SRI-NIC,NIC :\n             DEC-2060 : TOPS20 : TCP/TELNET,TCP/SMTP,TCP/TIME,TCP/FTP,\n\
    \             TCP/ECHO,ICMP :\n      A response may stretch across more than one\
    \ line.  Continuation\n      lines always begin with at least one space.\n   2.\
    \ HADDR Query - Given an internet address (as specified in RFC 796)\n   find the\
    \ entry or entries that match that address. For example:\n      HADDR 26.0.0.73\
    \ <CRLF>\n         where <CRLF> is a carriage return/ linefeed, and '26.0.0.73'\
    \ is\n         a host address.\n      The likely response is the same as for the\
    \ previous HNAME request.\n"

    \     ERR : <code> : <string> :\n        as in\n      ERR : NAMNFD : Name not\
    \ found :\n   The error code is a unique descriptor, limited to 8 characters in\n\
    \   length for any given error.  It may be used by the access program to\n   identify\
    \ the error and, in some cases, to handle it automatically.\n   The string is\
    \ an accompanying message for a given error for that case\n   where the access\
    \ program simply logs the error message.  Current\n   codes and their associated\
    \ interpretations are\n      NAMNFD    Name not found; name not in table\n   \
    \   ADRNFD    Address not found; address not in table\n      ILLCOM    Illegal\
