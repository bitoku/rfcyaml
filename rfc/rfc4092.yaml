  - "1.  Introduction\n   SIP [3] UAs (User Agents) often support different network\
    \ address\n   types.  For example, a UA may have an IPv6 address and an IPv4\n\
    \   address.  Such a UA will typically be willing to use any of its\n   addresses\
    \ to establish a media session with a remote UA.  If the\n   remote UA only supports\
    \ IPv6, for instance, both UAs will use IPv6 to\n   send and receive media.\n\
    \   The Alternative Network Address Types (ANAT) semantics [7] of the SDP\n  \
    \ [2] grouping framework [5] allow UAs to offer [4] alternative\n   addresses\
    \ of different types in an SDP session description.  The\n   IPv4/IPv6 dual-stack\
    \ SIP UA of our previous example would generate an\n   offer grouping an IPv6\
    \ media line and an IPv4 media line using ANAT.\n   Upon receipt of this offer,\
    \ the answerer [4] would accept one media\n   line and reject the other.\n   If\
    \ the recipient of an offer that uses ANAT supports the ANAT\n   semantics, everything\
    \ works as described in the ANAT specification\n   [7].  Nevertheless, the recipient\
    \ of such an offer (i.e., the\n   answerer) may not support ANAT.  In this case,\
    \ different\n   implementations of the answerer would react in different ways.\
    \  This\n   document discusses the answerer's behaviors that are most likely to\n\
    \   be found and describes their consequences.  To avoid these\n   consequences,\
    \ we define the sdp-anat SIP option-tag.\n   The sdp-anat option-tag can be used\
    \ to ensure that an offer using\n   ANAT is not processed by answerers without\
    \ support for ANAT.  This\n   option-tag can also be used to explicitly discover\
    \ the capabilities\n   of a UA (i.e., whether it supports ANAT).\n"

    \ the Require and\n   Supported SIP [3] header fields.  SIP user agents that place\
    \ this\n   option-tag in a Supported header field understand the ANAT semantics\n\
    \   as defined in [7].\n"
- title: 4.  Backward Compatibility
  contents:
  - "4.  Backward Compatibility\n   Answerers without support for ANAT will react\
    \ in different ways upon\n   receipt of an offer using ANAT.  We expect that,\
    \ even under the same\n   circumstances, different implementations will behave\
    \ in different\n   ways.  In this section, we analyze these behaviors (i.e., the\n\
    \   following subsections assume that the answerer does not support\n   ANAT).\n"
- title: 4.1.  Answerer Supports All the Network Types Offered
  contents:
  - "4.1.  Answerer Supports All the Network Types Offered\n   If the answerer supports\
    \ all the network types in the offer, it may\n   accept the offer and establish\
    \ all the media streams in it.  This\n   behavior is not what the offerer expects\
    \ because it results in too\n   many media streams being established.  If the\
    \ answerer starts sending\n   media over all of them, the result may be a high\
    \ bandwidth usage.\n   The answerer may also reject the offer, because although\
    \ it supports\n   all the network types in it, the answerer may not support them\n\
    \   simultaneously.  The error response sent by the answerer will most\n   likely\
    \ not be explicit enough about the situation.  So, the offerer\n   will not understand\
    \ what went wrong.\n   In the previous scenarios, the sdp-anat option-tag would\
    \ avoid the\n   establishment of too many media streams and would allow the answerer\n\
    \   to explicitly inform the offerer that the answerer did not support\n   ANAT.\n"
- title: 4.2.  Answerer Does Not Support All the Network Types Offered
  contents:
  - "4.2.  Answerer Does Not Support All the Network Types Offered\n   If the answerer\
    \ does not support all the network types in the offer,\n   it may only establish\
    \ the media streams whose address types it\n   understands and reject the rest.\
    \  This would be an acceptable\n   behavior from the offerer's point of view.\n\
    \   On the other hand, the answerer may also reject the offer because it\n   contains\
    \ unknown address types.  The error response sent by the\n   answerer will most\
    \ likely not be explicit enough about the situation.\n   So, the offerer will\
    \ not understand what went wrong.\n   In the previous scenario, the sdp-anat option-tag\
    \ would allow the\n   answerer to explicitly inform the offerer that the answerer\
    \ did not\n   support ANAT.\n"
- title: 4.3.  OPTIONS Requests
  contents:
  - "4.3.  OPTIONS Requests\n   Although RFC 3388 [5] provides servers with a means\
    \ to indicate\n   support for ANAT in an SDP description, many servers do not\
    \ include\n   an SDP description in their responses to OPTIONS requests.  The\n\
    \   sdp-anat option-tag makes it possible to discover if any server\n   supports\
    \ ANAT, since they would include this option-tag in a\n   Supported header field\
    \ in their responses.\n"
- title: 5.  Option-Tag Usage
  contents:
  - "5.  Option-Tag Usage\n   As discussed in the previous section, the use of the\
    \ sdp-anat\n   option-tag makes SIP messages more explicit about ANAT support.\
    \  So,\n   SIP entities generating an offer that uses the ANAT semantics SHOULD\n\
    \   place the sdp-anat option-tag in a Require header field.  SIP\n   entities\
    \ that support the ANAT semantics MUST understand the sdp-anat\n   option-tag.\n"
- title: 6.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "6.  Security Considerations\n   An attacker may attempt to add the sdp-anat option\
    \ tag to the Require\n   header field of a message to perform a DoS attack.  If\
    \ the UAS does\n   not support ANAT, it will return an error response instead\
    \ of\n   processing the message.\n   An attacker may attempt to remove the sdp-anat\
    \ option-tag from the\n   Require header field of a message.  This may result\
    \ in the\n   establishment of too many media streams.\n   To avoid the previous\
    \ attacks, integrity protection of the Require\n   header field is RECOMMENDED.\
    \  The natural choice to integrity protect\n   header fields in SIP is S/MIME\
    \ [6].\n"
