- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   RFC 5586 generalized the PW-ACH into the G-ACh.  However,\
    \ registries\n   and allocations of G-ACh namespaces had been distributed throughout\n\
    \   different registries.  This document coalesces these into a new\n   \"Generic\
    \ Associated Channel (G-ACh) Parameters\" registry in the\n   \"Multiprotocol\
    \ Label Switching Architecture (MPLS)\" name space.  This\n   reorganization achieves\
    \ two purposes: it allocates the G-ACh\n   registries in their natural place in\
    \ the MPLS names space, and it\n   provides a single view of the G-ACh registries,\
    \ to simplify future\n   assignments and avoid potential conflicts.  This is an\
    \ update to RFC\n   5586 [RFC5586].\n   Further, the \"Pseudowire Associated Channel\
    \ Types\" registry is\n   renamed to \"Generalized Associated Channel (G-ACh)\
    \ Types (including\n   Pseudowire Associated Channel Types)\" to make its generalized\
    \ status\n   explicit, and it is moved into the newly created registry.\n   Additionally,\
    \ RFC 6374 [RFC6374], RFC 6378 [RFC6378], RFC 6427\n   [RFC6427], and RFC 6428\
    \ [RFC6428] specify allocations within the\n   G-ACh that are now moved into the\
    \ new registry.\n   With respect to where to find these IANA registries, the RFCs\
    \ listed\n   above are updated as indicated in Section 3; however, the registries\n\
    \   themselves are not changed (with the exception of one being renamed).\n  \
    \ They are moved unchanged to the new registry.\n"
- title: 2.  IANA Considerations
  contents:
  - "2.  IANA Considerations\n   IANA has added this document as a reference for each\
    \ registry that\n   has been moved or renamed as a result of actions requested\
    \ by this\n   document.\n   IANA has replaced all the relocated registries with\
    \ pointers to the\n   new URL or with a redirect.\n"

    \ IANA Registry\n   IANA has created a new \"Generic Associated Channel (G-ACh)\n\
    \   Parameters\" registry.  This is the common registry that will include\n  \
    \ all the registries being moved in Sections 2.2 and 2.3.\n"
- title: 2.2.  Renaming and Moving the Pseudowire Associated Channel Types
  contents:
  - "2.2.  Renaming and Moving the Pseudowire Associated Channel Types\n      Registry\n\
    \   This document renames the \"Pseudowire Associated Channel Types\"\n   registry\
    \ [IANA-PWE3] to \"MPLS Generalized Associated Channel (G-ACh)\n   Types (including\
    \ Pseudowire Associated Channel Types)\".  This\n   registry has been moved and\
    \ included in the \"Generic Associated\n   Channel (G-ACh) Parameters\" registry\
    \ created in Section 2.1 because\n   any additional registries are dependent upon\
    \ the Associated Channel\n   Header Type.\n   At the time of publishing this document\
    \ and moving the registry, the\n   following RFCs have G-ACh Types allocated:\
    \ [RFC4385], [RFC5586],\n   [RFC5718], [RFC5885], [RFC6374], [RFC6378], [RFC6426],\

- title: 2.3.  Consolidating G-ACh Registries
  contents:
  - "2.3.  Consolidating G-ACh Registries\n   This document further updates the following\
    \ RFCs by moving the\n   registries related to G-ACh to the common \"Generic Associated\

    \ the PWE Parameters Registry [IANA-PWE3]:\n      *  MPLS Generalized Associated\
    \ Channel (G-ACh) Types [RFC5586]\n      *  CC/CV MEP-ID TLV Registry [RFC6428]\n\

    \ Label Switching (MPLS) Operations,\n      Administration, and Management (OAM)\
    \ Parameters\" registry.\n      Therefore, the IANA has removed the MPLS OAM registry,\

- title: 3.  RFC Updates

    \ registry: RFCs 6374, 6378, 6427, and 6428.\n   All the registries listed above\
    \ are moved without any changes to\n   their content.  The reason to move them\
