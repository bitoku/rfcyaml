  - "2.0  Overview\n   Over the last several years the OSPF routing protocol [OSPF]\
    \ has been\n   widely deployed throughout the Internet.  As a result of this\n\
    \   deployment and the evolution of networking technology, OSPF has been\n   extended\
    \ to support many options; this evolution will obviously\n   continue.\n   This\
    \ memo defines enhancements to the OSPF protocol to support a new\n   class of\
    \ link-state advertisements (LSA) called Opaque LSAs.  Opaque\n   LSAs provide\
    \ a generalized mechanism to allow for the future\n   extensibility of OSPF. The\
    \ information contained in Opaque LSAs may\n   be used directly by OSPF or indirectly\
    \ by some application wishing to\n   distribute information throughout the OSPF\
    \ domain.  For example, the\n   OSPF LSA may be used by routers to distribute\
    \ IP to link-layer\n   address resolution information (see [ARA] for more information).\
    \  The\n   exact use of Opaque LSAs is beyond the scope of this memo.\n   Opaque\
    \ LSAs consist of a standard LSA header followed by a 32-bit\n   qaligned application-specific\
    \ information field.  Like any other LSA,\n   the Opaque LSA uses the link-state\
    \ database distribution mechanism\n   for flooding this information throughout\
    \ the topology.  The link-\n   state type field of the Opaque LSA identifies the\
    \ LSA's range of\n   topological distribution. This range is referred to as the\
    \ Flooding\n   Scope.\n   It is envisioned that an implementation of the Opaque\
    \ option provides\n   an application interface for 1) encapsulating application-specific\n\
    \   information in a specific Opaque type, 2) sending and receiving\n   application-specific\
    \ information, and 3) if required, informing the\n   application of the change\
    \ in validity of previously received\n   information when topological changes\
    \ are detected.\n"

- title: 3.0 The Opaque LSA
  contents:
  - "3.0 The Opaque LSA\n   Opaque LSAs are types 9, 10 and 11 link-state advertisements.\
    \  Opaque\n   LSAs consist of a standard LSA header followed by a 32-bit aligned\n\
    \   application-specific information field.  Standard link-state database\n  \
    \ flooding mechanisms are used for distribution of Opaque LSAs.  The\n   range\
    \ of topological distribution (i.e., the flooding scope) of an\n   Opaque LSA\
    \ is identified by its link-state type.  This section\n   documents the flooding\
    \ of Opaque LSAs.\n   The flooding scope associated with each Opaque link-state\
    \ type is\n   defined as follows.\n     o Link-state type 9 denotes a link-local\
    \ scope. Type-9 Opaque\n       LSAs are not flooded beyond the local (sub)network.\n\
    \     o Link-state type 10 denotes an area-local scope. Type-10 Opaque\n     \
    \  LSAs are not flooded beyond the borders of their associated area.\n     o Link-state\
    \ type 11 denotes that the LSA is flooded throughout\n       the Autonomous System\
    \ (AS). The flooding scope of type-11\n       LSAs are equivalent to the flooding\
    \ scope of AS-external (type-5)\n       LSAs.  Specifically type-11 Opaque LSAs\
    \ are 1) flooded throughout\n       all transit areas, 2) not flooded into stub\
    \ areas from the\n       backbone and 3) not originated by routers into their\
    \ connected\n       stub areas.  As with type-5 LSAs, if a type-11 Opaque LSA\
    \ is\n       received in a stub area from a neighboring router within the\n  \
    \     stub area the LSA is rejected.\n   The link-state ID of the Opaque LSA is\
    \ divided into an Opaque type\n   field (the first 8 bits) and a type-specific\
    \ ID (the remaining 24\n   bits).  The packet format of the Opaque LSA is given\
    \ in Appendix A.\n   Section 7.0 describes Opaque type allocation and assignment.\n\
    \   The responsibility for proper handling of the Opaque LSA's flooding\n   scope\
    \ is placed on both the sender and receiver of the LSA.  The\n   receiver must\
    \ always store a valid received Opaque LSA in its link-\n   state database.  The\
    \ receiver must not accept Opaque LSAs that\n   violate the flooding scope (e.g.,\
    \ a type-11 (domain-wide) Opaque LSA\n   is not accepted in a stub area).  The\
    \ flooding scope effects both the\n   synchronization of the link-state database\
    \ and the flooding\n   procedure.\n   The following describes the modifications\
    \ to these procedures that\n   are necessary to insure conformance to the Opaque\
    \ LSA's Scoping\n   Rules.\n"
- title: 3.1  Flooding Opaque LSAs
  contents:
  - "3.1  Flooding Opaque LSAs\n   The flooding of Opaque LSAs must follow the rules\
    \ of Flooding Scope\n   as specified in this section.  Section 13 of [OSPF] describes\
    \ the\n   OSPF flooding procedure.  The following describes the Opaque LSA's\n\
    \   type-specific flooding restrictions.\n     o If the Opaque LSA is type 9 (the\
    \ flooding scope is link-local)\n       and the interface that the LSA was received\
    \ on is not the same as\n       the target interface (e.g., the interface associated\
    \ with a\n       particular target neighbor), the Opaque LSA must not be flooded\n\
    \       out that interface (or to that neighbor).  An implementation\n       should\
    \ keepk track of the IP interface associated with each\n       Opaque LSA having\
    \ a link-local flooding scope.\n     o If the Opaque LSA is type 10 (the flooding\
    \ scope is area-local)\n       and the area associated with Opaque LSA (upon reception)\
    \ is not\n       the same as the area associated with the target interface, the\n\
    \       Opaque LSA must not be flooded out the interface.  An\n       implementation\
    \ should keep track of the OSPF area associated\n       with each Opaque LSA having\
    \ an area-local flooding scope.\n     o If the Opaque LSA is type 11 (the LSA\
    \ is flooded throughout the\n       AS) and the target interface is associated\
    \ with a stub area the\n       Opaque LSA must not be flooded out the interface.\
    \  A type-11\n       Opaque LSA that is received on an interface associated with\
    \ a\n       stub area must be discarded and not acknowledged (the\n       neighboring\
    \ router has flooded the LSA in error).\n   When opaque-capable routers and non-opaque-capable\
    \ OSPF routers are\n   mixed together in a routing domain, the Opaque LSAs are\
    \ not flooded\n   to the non-opaque-capable routers. As a general design principle,\n\
    \   optional OSPF advertisements are only flooded to those routers that\n   understand\
    \ them.\n   An opaque-capable router learns of its neighbor's opaque capability\n\
    \   at the beginning of the \"Database Exchange Process\" (see Section 10.6\n\
    \   of [OSPF], receiving Database Description packets from a neighbor in\n   state\
    \ ExStart). A neighbor is opaque-capable if and only if it sets\n   the O-bit\
    \ in the Options field of its Database Description packets;\n   the O-bit is not\
    \ set in packets other than Database Description\n   packets.  Then, in the next\
    \ step of the Database Exchange process,\n   Opaque LSAs are included in the Database\
    \ summary list that is sent to\n   the neighbor (see Sections 3.2 below and 10.3\
    \ of [OSPF]) if and only\n   if the neighbor is opaque capable.\n   When flooding\
    \ Opaque-LSAs to adjacent neighbors, a opaque-capable\n   router looks at the\
    \ neighbor's opaque capability.  Opaque LSAs are\n   only flooded to opaque-capable\
    \ neighbors. To be more precise, in\n   Section 13.3 of [OSPF], Opaque LSAs are\
    \ only placed on the link-state\n   retransmission lists of opaque-capable neighbors.\
    \  However, when send\n   ing Link State Update packets as multicasts, a non-opaque-capable\n\
    \   neighbor may (inadvertently) receive Opaque LSAs. The non-opaque-\n   capable\
    \ router will then simply discard the LSA (see Section 13 of\n   [OSPF], receiving\
    \ LSAs having unknown LS types).\n"

    \ in section 10.3 of [OSPF] remains\n   unchanged except for the action associated\
    \ with State: ExStart,\n   Event: NegotiationDone which is where the Database\

- title: 5.0 Management Considerations
  contents:
  - "5.0 Management Considerations\n   This section identifies the current OSPF MIB\
    \ [OSPFMIB] capabilities\n   that are applicable to the Opaque option and lists\
    \ the additional\n   management information which is required for its support.\n\
    \   Opaque LSAs are types 9, 10 and 11 link-state advertisements.  The\n   link-state\
    \ ID of the Opaque LSA is divided into an Opaque type field\n   (the first 8 bits)\
    \ and a type-specific ID (the remaining 24 bits).\n   The packet format of the\
    \ Opaque LSA is given in Appendix A.  The\n   range of topological distribution\
    \ (i.e., the flooding scope) of an\n   Opaque LSA is identified by its link-state\
    \ type.\n     o Link-State type 9 Opaque LSAs have a link-local scope. Type-9\n\
    \       Opaque LSAs are flooded on a single local (sub)network but are\n     \
    \  not flooded beyond the local (sub)network.\n     o Link-state type 10 Opaque\
    \ LSAs have an area-local scope. Type-10\n       Opaque LSAs are flooded throughout\
    \ a single area but are not\n       flooded beyond the borders of the associated\
    \ area.\n     o Link-state type 11 Opaque LSAs have an Autonomous-System-wide\n\
    \       scope.  The flooding scope of type-11 LSAs are equivalent to the\n   \
    \    flooding scope of AS-external (type-5) LSAs.\n   The OSPF MIB provides a\
    \ number of objects that can be used to manage\n   and monitor an OSPF router's\
    \ Link-State Database.  The ones that are\n   relevant to the Opaque option are\
    \ as follows.\n     The ospfGeneralGroup defines two objects for keeping track\
    \ of newly\n     originated and newly received LSAs (ospfOriginateNewLsas and\n\
    \     ospfRxNewLsas respectively).\n     The OSPF MIB defines a set of optional\
    \ traps.  The ospfOriginateLsa\n     trap signifies that a new LSA has been originated\
    \ by a router and\n     the ospfMaxAgeLsa trap signifies that one of the LSAs\
    \ in the\n     router's link-state database has aged to MaxAge.\n     The ospfAreaTable\
    \ describes the configured parameters and\n     cumulative statistics of the router's\
    \ attached areas. This table\n     includes a count of the number of LSAs contained\
    \ in the area's\n     link-state database (ospfAreaLsaCount), and a sum of the\
    \ LSA's LS\n     checksums contained in this area (ospfAreaLsaCksumSum).  This\
    \ sum\n     can be used to determine if there has been a change in a router's\n\
    \     link-state database, and to compare the link-state database of two\n   \
    \  routers.\n     The ospfLsdbTable describes the OSPF Process's link-state database\n\
    \     (excluding AS-external LSAs).  Entries in this table are indexed\n     with\
    \ an Area ID, a link-state type, a link-state ID and the\n     originating router's\
    \ Router ID.\n   The management objects that are needed to support the Opaque\
    \ option\n   are as follows.\n     An Opaque-option-enabled object is needed to\
    \ indicate if the Opaque\n     option is enabled on the router.\n     The origination\
    \ and reception of new Opaque LSAs should be\n     reflected in the counters ospfOriginateNewLsas\
    \ and ospfRxNewLsas\n     (inclusive for types 9, 10 and 11 Opaque LSAs).\n  \
    \   If the OSPF trap option is supported, the origination of new Opaque\n    \
    \ LSAs and purging of MaxAge Opaque LSAs should be reflected in the\n     ospfOriginateLsa\
    \ and ospfMaxAgeLsa traps (inclusive for types 9, 10\n     and 11 Opaque LSAs).\n\
    \     The number of type-10 Opaque LSAs should be reflected in\n     ospfAreaLsaCount;\
    \ the checksums of type-10 Opaque LSAs should be\n     included in ospfAreaLsaChksumSum.\n\
    \     Type-10 Opaque LSAs should be included in the ospfLsdbTable.  Note\n   \
    \  that this table does not include a method of examining the Opaque\n     type\
    \ field (in the Opaque option this is a sub-field of the link-\n     state ID).\n\
    \     Up until now, LSAs have not had a link-local scope so there is no\n    \
    \ method of requesting the number of, or examining the LSAs that are\n     associated\
    \ with a specific OSPF interface. A new group of\n     management objects are\
    \ required to support type-9 Opaque LSAs.\n     These objects should include a\
    \ count of type-9 Opaque LSAs, a\n     checksum sum and a table for displaying\
    \ the link-state database for\n     type-9 Opaque LSAs on a per-interface basis.\
    \  Entries in this table\n     should be indexed with an Area ID, interface's\
    \ IP address, Opaque\n     type, link-state ID and the originating router's Router\
    \ ID.\n     Prior to the introduction of type-11 Opaque LSAs, AS-External\n  \
    \   (type-5) LSAs have been the only link-state types which have an\n     Autonomous-System-wide\
    \ scope.  A new group of objects are required\n     to support type-11 Opaque\
    \ LSAs.  These objects should include a\n     count of type-11 Opaque LSAs, a\
    \ type-11 checksum sum and a table\n     for displaying the type-11 link-state\
    \ database.  Entries in this\n     table should be indexed with the Opaque type,\
    \ link-state ID and the\n     originating router's Router ID.  The type-11 link-state\
    \ database\n     table will allow type-11 LSAs to be displayed once for the router\n\
    \     rather than once in each non-stub area.\n"
- title: 6.0 Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "6.0 Security Considerations\n   There are two types of issues that need be addressed\
    \ when looking at\n   protecting routing protocols from misconfigurations and\
    \ malicious\n   attacks.  The first is authentication and certification of routing\n\
    \   protocol information.  The second is denial of service attacks\n   resulting\
    \ from repetitive origination of the same router\n   advertisement or origination\
    \ a large number of distinct\n   advertisements resulting in database overflow.\
    \  Note that both of\n   these concerns exist independently of a router's support\
    \ for the\n   Opaque option.\n   To address the authentication concerns, OSPF\
    \ protocol exchanges are\n   authenticated.  OSPF supports multiple types of authentication;\
    \ the\n   type of authentication in use can be configured on a per network\n \
    \  segment basis. One of OSPF's authentication types, namely the\n   Cryptographic\
    \ authentication option, is believed to be secure against\n   passive attacks\
    \ and provide significant protection against active\n   attacks. When using the\
    \ Cryptographic authentication option, each\n   router appends a \"message digest\"\
    \ to its transmitted OSPF packets.\n   Receivers then use the shared secret key\
    \ and received digest to\n   verify that each received OSPF packet is authentic.\n\
    \   The quality of the security provided by the Cryptographic\n   authentication\
    \ option depends completely on the strength of the\n   message digest algorithm\
    \ (MD5 is currently the only message digest\n   algorithm specified), the strength\
    \ of the key being used, and the\n   correct implementation of the security mechanism\
    \ in all communicating\n   OSPF implementations. It also requires that all parties\
    \ maintain the\n   secrecy of the shared secret key.  None of the standard OSPF\n\
    \   authentication types provide confidentiality. Nor do they protect\n   against\
    \ traffic analysis.  For more information on the standard OSPF\n   security mechanisms,\
    \ see Sections 8.1, 8.2, and Appendix D of [OSPF].\n   [DIGI] describes the extensions\
    \ to OSPF required to add digital\n   signature authentication to Link State data\
    \ and to provide a\n   certification mechanism for router data.  [DIGI] also describes\
    \ the\n   added LSA processing and key management as well as a method for\n  \
    \ migration from, or co-existence with, standard OSPF V2.\n   Repetitive origination\
    \ of advertisements are addressed by OSPF by\n   mandating a limit on the frequency\
    \ that new instances of any\n   particular LSA can be originated and accepted\
    \ during the flooding\n   procedure.  The frequency at which new LSA instances\
    \ may be\n   originated is set equal to once every MinLSInterval seconds, whose\n\
    \   value is 5 seconds (see Section 12.4 of [OSPF]).  The frequency at\n   which\
    \ new LSA instances are accepted during flooding is once every\n   MinLSArrival\
    \ seconds, whose value is set to 1 (see Section 13,\n   Appendix B and G.5 of\
    \ [OSPF]).\n   Proper operation of the OSPF protocol requires that all OSPF routers\n\
    \   maintain an identical copy of the OSPF link-state database.  However,\n  \
    \ when the size of the link-state database becomes very large, some\n   routers\
    \ may be unable to keep the entire database due to resource\n   shortages; we\
    \ term this \"database overflow\".  When database overflow\n   is anticipated,\
    \ the routers with limited resources can be\n   accommodated by configuring OSPF\
    \ stub areas and NSSAs.  [OVERFLOW]\n   details a way of gracefully handling unanticipated\
    \ database\n   overflows.\n"

    \ Field followed by\n   the packet format of the Opaque LSA.\n"
- title: A.1 The Options Field
  contents:
  - "A.1 The Options Field\n   The OSPF Options field is present in OSPF Hello packets,\
    \ Database\n   Description packets and all link-state advertisements.  The Options\n\
    \   field enables OSPF routers to support (or not support) optional\n   capabilities,\
    \ and to communicate their capability level to other OSPF\n   routers. Through\
    \ this mechanism routers of differing capabilities can\n   be mixed within an\
    \ OSPF routing domain.\n   When used in Hello packets, the Options field allows\
    \ a router to\n   reject a neighbor because of a capability mismatch.  Alternatively,\n\
    \   when capabilities are exchanged in Database Description packets a\n   router\
    \ can choose not to forward certain link-state advertisements to\n   a neighbor\
    \ because of its reduced functionality.  Lastly, listing\n   capabilities in link-state\
    \ advertisements allows routers to forward\n   traffic around reduced functionality\
    \ routers by excluding them from\n   parts of the routing table calculation.\n\
    \   Six bits of the OSPF Options field have been assigned, although only\n   the\
    \ O-bit is described completely by this memo.  Each bit is\n   described briefly\
    \ below. Routers should reset (i.e., clear)\n   unrecognized bits in the Options\
    \ field when sending Hello packets or\n   Database Description packets and when\
    \ originating link-state\n   advertisements. Conversely, routers encountering\
    \ unrecognized Option\n   bits in received Hello Packets, Database Description\
    \ packets or\n   link-state advertisements should ignore the capability and process\n\
    \   the packet/advertisement normally.\n                +------------------------------------+\n\

  - "A.2 The Opaque LSA\n   Opaque LSAs are Type 9, 10 and 11 link-state advertisements.\
    \  These\n   advertisements may be used directly by OSPF or indirectly by some\n\
    \   application wishing to distribute information throughout the OSPF\n   domain.\
    \  The function of the Opaque LSA option is to provide for\n   future extensibility\
    \ of OSPF.\n   Opaque LSAs contain some number of octets (of application-specific\n\
    \   data) padded to 32-bit alignment.  Like any other LSA, the Opaque LSA\n  \
    \ uses the link-state database distribution mechanism for flooding this\n   information\
    \ throughout the topology.  However, the Opaque LSA has a\n   flooding scope associated\
    \ with it so that the scope of flooding may\n   be link-local (type 9), area-local\
    \ (type 10) or the entire OSPF\n   routing domain (type 11).  Section 3 of this\
    \ document describes the\n   flooding procedures for the Opaque LSA.\n       0\

    \   The link-state type of the Opaque LSA identifies the LSA's range of\n    \
    \ topological distribution. This range is referred to as the Flooding\n     Scope.\
    \  The following explains the flooding scope of each of the\n     link-state types.\n\
    \     o A value of 9 denotes a link-local scope. Opaque LSAs with a\n     link-local\
    \ scope are not flooded beyond the local (sub)network.\n     o A value of 10 denotes\
    \ an area-local scope. Opaque LSAs with a\n     area-local scope are not flooded\
    \ beyond the area that they are\n     originated into.\n     o A value of 11 denotes\
    \ that the LSA is flooded throughout the\n     Autonomous System (e.g., has the\
    \ same scope as type-5 LSAs).\n     Opaque LSAs with AS-wide scope are not flooded\
    \ into stub areas.\n   Syntax Of The Opaque LSA's Link-State ID\n   The link-state\
    \ ID of the Opaque LSA is divided into an Opaque Type\n   field (the first 8 bits)\
    \ and an Opaque ID (the remaining 24 bits).\n   See section 7.0 of this document\
    \ for a description of Opaque type\n   allocation and assignment.\n"
