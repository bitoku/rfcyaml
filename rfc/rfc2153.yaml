  contents:
  - "Abstract\n   The Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) [1] provides a standard method\
    \ for\n   transporting multi-protocol datagrams over point-to-point links.  PPP\n\
    \   defines an extensible Link Control Protocol (LCP) for establishing,\n   configuring,\
    \ and testing the data-link connection; and a family of\n   Network Control Protocols\
    \ (NCPs) for establishing and configuring\n   different network-layer protocols.\n\
    \   This document defines a general mechanism for proprietary vendor\n   extensions.\n"

- title: 3.  Organizationally Unique Identifiers
  contents:
  - "3.  Organizationally Unique Identifiers\n   The three-octet Organizationally\
    \ Unique Identifier (OUI) identifies\n   an organization that administers the\
    \ meaning of the message.  This\n   OUI is based on IEEE 802 vendor assignments.\n\
    \   IEEE contact details for assignment of an OUI are given in [RFC-\n   1700].\
    \  Vendors that desire to use their IEEE 802 OUI for PPP Vendor\n   Extensions\
    \ should also register the OUI with IANA.\n   In the alternative, a vendor that\
    \ does not otherwise need an IEEE\n   assigned OUI can request a PPP specific\
    \ OUI from IANA.  This OUI\n   shall be assigned from the 'CF0000' series.  This\
    \ has both the\n   \"locally-assigned\" and \"broadcast/multicast\" bits set to\
    \ 1; that is,\n   the least significant two bits of the most significant octet\
    \ are both\n   set to 1.\n   Appearance in memory, bits transmitted right-to-left\
    \ within octets,\n   octets transmitted left-to-right:\n   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+\n\
    \   |1 1 0 0 1 1 1 1|x x x x x x x x|x x x x x x x x|\n   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+\n\
    \                | |\n                | Multicast\n                Local\n   Rationale:\n\
    \      This is defined for vendors that are not able to use IEEE\n      assignments,\
    \ such as software-only vendors.\n      It is not clear how the IEEE assigns blocks.\
    \  In some instances,\n      the \"locally-assigned\" bit is known to have been\
    \ used.\n      However, multicast has no meaning in PPP.  Therefore, an IEEE\n\
    \      assigned OUI would have the multicast bit cleared to 0.\n      The 'CF0000'\
    \ series was arbitrarily chosen to match the PPP NLPID\n      'CF', as a matter\
    \ of mnemonic convenience.\n"
