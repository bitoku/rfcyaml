  - "1.  Introduction\n   OSPF (Open Shortest Path First) Version 2 [N1] defines the\
    \ fields\n   AuType and Authentication in its protocol header to provide security.\n\
    \   In OSPF for IPv6 (OSPFv3) [N2], both of the authentication fields\n   were\
    \ removed from OSPF headers.  OSPFv3 relies on the IPv6\n   Authentication Header\
    \ (AH) and IPv6 Encapsulating Security Payload\n   (ESP) to provide integrity,\
    \ authentication, and/or confidentiality.\n   This document describes how IPv6\
    \ AH/ESP extension headers can be used\n   to provide authentication/confidentiality\
    \ to OSPFv3.\n   It is assumed that the reader is familiar with OSPFv3 [N2], AH\
    \ [N5],\n   ESP [N4], the concept of security associations, tunnel and transport\n\
    \   mode of IPsec, and the key management options available for AH and\n   ESP\
    \ (manual keying [N3] and Internet Key Exchange (IKE)[I1]).\n"

- title: 2.  Transport Mode vs. Tunnel Mode
  contents:
  - "2.  Transport Mode vs. Tunnel Mode\n   The transport mode Security Association\
    \ (SA) is generally used\n   between two hosts or routers/gateways when they are\
    \ acting as hosts.\n   The SA must be a tunnel mode SA if either end of the security\n\
    \   association is a router/gateway.  Two hosts MAY establish a tunnel\n   mode\
    \ SA between themselves.  OSPFv3 packets are exchanged between\n   routers.  However,\
    \ since the packets are locally delivered, the\n   routers assume the role of\
    \ hosts in the context of tunnel mode SA.\n   All implementations conforming to\
    \ this specification MUST support\n   transport mode SA to provide required IPsec\
    \ security to OSPFv3\n   packets.  They MAY also support tunnel mode SA to provide\
    \ required\n   IPsec security to OSPFv3 packets.\n"

    \ support\n   authentication for OSPFv3.\n   In order to provide authentication\
    \ to OSPFv3, implementations MUST\n   support ESP and MAY support AH.\n   If ESP\
    \ in transport mode is used, it will only provide authentication\n   to OSPFv3\

    \   If AH in transport mode is used, it will provide authentication to\n   OSPFv3\
    \ protocol packets, selected portions of IPv6 header, selected\n   portions of\
    \ extension headers, and selected options.\n   When OSPFv3 authentication is enabled,\n\
    \      o  OSPFv3 packets that are not protected with AH or ESP MUST be\n     \

- title: 5.  Distinguishing OSPFv3 from OSPFv2
  contents:
  - "5.  Distinguishing OSPFv3 from OSPFv2\n   The IP/IPv6 Protocol Type for OSPFv2\
    \ and OSPFv3 is the same (89), and\n   OSPF distinguishes them based on the OSPF\
    \ header version number.\n   However, current IPsec standards do not allow using\
    \ arbitrary\n   protocol-specific header fields as the selectors.  Therefore,\
    \ the\n   OSPF version field in the OSPF header cannot be used to distinguish\n\
    \   OSPFv3 packets from OSPFv2 packets.  As OSPFv2 is only for IPv4 and\n   OSPFv3\
    \ is only for IPv6, the version field in the IP header can be\n   used to distinguish\
    \ OSPFv3 packets from OSPFv2 packets.\n"
- title: 6.  IPsec Requirements
  contents:
  - "6.  IPsec Requirements\n   In order to implement this specification, the following\
    \ IPsec\n   capabilities are required.\n   Transport mode\n      IPsec in transport\
    \ mode MUST be supported. [N3]\n   Multiple Security Policy Databases (SPDs)\n\
    \      The implementation MUST support multiple SPDs with an SPD\n      selection\
    \ function that provides an ability to choose a specific\n      SPD based on interface.\
    \ [N3]\n   Selectors\n      The implementation MUST be able to use source address,\
    \ destination\n      address, protocol, and direction as selectors in the SPD.\n\
    \   Interface ID tagging\n      The implementation MUST be able to tag the inbound\
    \ packets with\n      the ID of the interface (physical or virtual) via which\
    \ it\n      arrived. [N3]\n   Manual key support\n      Manually configured keys\
    \ MUST be able to secure the specified\n      traffic. [N3]\n   Encryption and\
    \ authentication algorithms\n      The implementation MUST NOT allow the user\
    \ to choose stream\n      ciphers as the encryption algorithm for securing OSPFv3\
    \ packets\n      since the stream ciphers are not suitable for manual keys.\n\
    \      Except when in conflict with the above statement, the key words\n     \
    \ \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHOULD\", and \"SHOULD NOT\" that\n\
    \      appear in the [N6] document for algorithms to be supported are to\n   \
    \   be interpreted as described in [N7] for OSPFv3 support as well.\n   Dynamic\
    \ IPsec rule configuration\n      The routing module SHOULD be able to configure,\
    \ modify, and delete\n      IPsec rules on the fly.  This is needed mainly for\
    \ securing\n      virtual links.\n   Encapsulation of ESP packet\n      IP encapsulation\
    \ of ESP packets MUST be supported.  For\n      simplicity, UDP encapsulation\
    \ of ESP packets SHOULD NOT be used.\n   Different SAs for different Differentiated\
    \ Services Code Points\n      (DSCPs)\n      As per [N3], the IPsec implementation\
    \ MUST support the\n      establishment and maintenance of multiple SAs with the\
    \ same\n      selectors between a given sender and receiver.  This allows the\n\
    \      implementation to associate different classes of traffic with the\n   \
    \   same selector values in support of Quality of Service (QoS).\n"
- title: 7.  Key Management
  contents:
  - "7.  Key Management\n   OSPFv3 exchanges both multicast and unicast packets. \
    \ While running\n   OSPFv3 over a broadcast interface, the authentication/confidentiality\n\
    \   required is \"one to many\".  Since IKE is based on the Diffie-Hellman\n \
    \  key agreement protocol and works only for two communicating parties,\n   it\
    \ is not possible to use IKE for providing the required \"one to\n   many\" authentication/confidentiality.\
    \  This specification mandates\n   the usage of Manual Keying with current IPsec\
    \ implementations.\n   Future specifications can explore the usage of protocols\
    \ like\n   Kerberized Internet Negotiation of Keys/Group Secure Association Key\n\
    \   Management Protocol (KINK/GSAKMP) when they are widely available.  In\n  \
    \ manual keying, SAs are statically installed on the routers and these\n   static\
    \ SAs are used to authenticate/encrypt packets.\n   The following discussion explains\
    \ that it is not scalable and is\n   practically infeasible to use different security\
    \ associations for\n   inbound and outbound traffic to provide the required \"\
    one to many\"\n   security.  Therefore, the implementations MUST use manually\n\
    \   configured keys with the same SA parameters (Security Parameter Index\n  \
    \ (SPI), keys, etc.) for both inbound and outbound SAs (as shown in\n   Figure\
    \ 3).\n          A                  |\n        SAa     ------------>|\n      \

    \ Figure 1, everything\n   seems to be fine.  A uses security association SAa\
    \ for outbound\n   packets and B uses the same for inbound packets and vice versa.\
    \  Now\n   if we include C in the group and C sends a packet using SAa, then\n\
    \   only A will be able to understand it.  Similarly, if C sends a packet\n  \
    \ using SAb, then only B will be able to understand it.  Since the\n   packets\
    \ are multicast and they are going to be processed by both A\n   and B, there\
    \ is no SA for C to use so that both A and B can\n   understand them.\n      \

- title: 8.  SA Granularity and Selectors
  contents:
  - "8.  SA Granularity and Selectors\n   The user SHOULD be given the choice of sharing\
    \ the same SA among\n   multiple interfaces or using a unique SA per interface.\n\
    \   OSPFv3 supports running multiple instances over one interface using\n   the\
    \ \"Instance Id\" field contained in the OSPFv3 header.  As IPsec\n   does not\
    \ support arbitrary fields in the protocol header to be used\n   as the selectors,\
    \ it is not possible to use different SAs for\n   different OSPFv3 instances running\
    \ over the same interface.\n   Therefore, all OSPFv3 instances running over the\
    \ same interface will\n   have to use the same SA.  In OSPFv3 RFC terminology,\
    \ SAs are per-link\n   and not per-interface.\n"
- title: 9.  Virtual Links
  contents:
  - "9.  Virtual Links\n   A different SA than the SA of the underlying interface\
    \ MUST be\n   provided for virtual links.  Packets sent on virtual links use\n\
    \   unicast non-link local IPv6 addresses as the IPv6 source address,\n   while\
    \ packets sent on other interfaces use multicast and unicast link\n   local addresses.\
    \  This difference in the IPv6 source address\n   differentiates the packets sent\
    \ on virtual links from other OSPFv3\n   interface types.\n   As the virtual link\
    \ end point IPv6 addresses are not known, it is not\n   possible to install SPD/Security\
    \ Association Database (SAD) entries\n   at the time of configuration.  The virtual\
    \ link end point IPv6\n   addresses are learned during the routing table computation\
    \ process.\n   The packet exchange over the virtual links starts only after the\n\
    \   discovery of the end point IPv6 addresses.  In order to protect these\n  \
    \ exchanges, the routing module must install the corresponding SPD/SAD\n   entries\
    \ before starting these exchanges.  Note that manual SA\n   parameters are preconfigured\
    \ but not installed in the SAD until the\n   end point addresses are learned.\n\
    \   According to the OSPFv3 RFC [N2], the virtual neighbor's IP address\n   is\
    \ set to the first prefix with the \"LA-bit\" set from the list of\n   prefixes\
    \ in intra-area-prefix-Link State Advertisements (LSAs)\n   originated by the\
    \ virtual neighbor.  But when it comes to choosing\n   the source address for\
    \ the packets that are sent over the virtual\n   link, the RFC [N2] simply suggests\
    \ using one of the router's own\n   global IPv6 addresses.  In order to install\
    \ the required security\n   rules for virtual links, the source address also needs\
    \ to be\n   predictable.  Hence, routers that implement this specification MUST\n\
    \   change the way the source and destination addresses are chosen for\n   packets\
    \ exchanged over virtual links when IPsec is enabled.\n   The first IPv6 address\
    \ with the \"LA-bit\" set in the list of prefixes\n   advertised in intra-area-prefix-LSAs\
    \ in the transit area MUST be used\n   as the source address for packets exchanged\
    \ over the virtual link.\n   When multiple intra-area-prefix-LSAs are originated,\
    \ they are\n   considered concatenated and are ordered by ascending Link State\
    \ ID.\n   The first IPv6 address with the \"LA-bit\" set in the list of prefixes\n\
    \   received in intra-area-prefix-LSAs from the virtual neighbor in the\n   transit\
    \ area MUST be used as the destination address for packets\n   exchanged over\
    \ the virtual link.  When multiple intra-area-prefix-\n   LSAs are received, they\
    \ are considered concatenated and are ordered\n   by ascending Link State ID.\n\
    \   This makes both the source and destination addresses of packets\n   exchanged\
    \ over the virtual link predictable when IPsec is enabled.\n"

- title: 10.1.  Rekeying Procedure
  contents:
  - "10.1.  Rekeying Procedure\n   The following three-step procedure SHOULD be provided\
    \ to rekey the\n   routers on a link without dropping OSPFv3 protocol packets\
    \ or\n   disrupting the adjacency.\n   (1) For every router on the link, create\
    \ an additional inbound SA for\n       the interface being rekeyed using a new\
    \ SPI and the new key.\n   (2) For every router on the link, replace the original\
    \ outbound SA\n       with one using the new SPI and key values.  The SA replacement\n\
    \       operation should be atomic with respect to sending OSPFv3 packets\n  \
    \     on the link so that no OSPFv3 packets are sent without\n       authentication/encryption.\n\
    \   (3) For every router on the link, remove the original inbound SA.\n   Note\
    \ that all routers on the link must complete step 1 before any\n   begin step\
    \ 2.  Likewise, all the routers on the link must complete\n   step 2 before any\
    \ begin step 3.\n   One way to control the progression from one step to the next\
    \ is for\n   each router to have a configurable time constant KeyRolloverInterval.\n\
    \   After the router begins step 1 on a given link, it waits for this\n   interval\
    \ and then moves to step 2.  Likewise, after moving to step 2,\n   it waits for\
    \ this interval and then moves to step 3.\n   In order to achieve smooth key transition,\
    \ all routers on a link\n   should use the same value for KeyRolloverInterval\
    \ and should initiate\n   the key rollover process within this time period.\n\
    \   At the end of this procedure, all the routers on the link will have a\n  \
    \ single inbound and outbound SA for OSPFv3 with the new SPI and key\n   values.\n"

    \     ESP/OSPF or AH/OSPF  protect\n   For rules 2 and 4, action \"protect\" means\
    \ encrypting/calculating\n   Integrity Check Value (ICV) and adding an ESP or\
    \ AH header.  For\n   rules 3 and 5, action \"protect\" means decrypting/authenticating\
    \ the\n   packets and stripping the ESP or AH header.\n   Rule 1 will bypass the\
    \ OSPFv3 packets without any IPsec processing on\n   the interfaces that have\
    \ OSPFv3 authentication/confidentiality\n   disabled.\n   Rules 2 and 4 will drop\
    \ the inbound OSPFv3 packets that have not been\n   secured with ESP/AH headers.\n\
    \   ESP/OSPF or AH/OSPF in rules 3 and 5 mean that it is an OSPF packet\n   secured\
    \ with ESP or AH.\n   Rules 2 and 3 are meant to secure the unicast and multicast\
    \ OSPF\n   packets that are not being exchanged over the virtual links.\n   Rules\
    \ 4 and 5 are meant to secure the packets being exchanged over\n   virtual links.\
    \  These rules are installed after learning the virtual\n   link end point IPv6\
    \ addresses.  These rules MUST be installed in the\n   SPD for the interfaces\
    \ that are connected to the transit area for the\n   virtual link.  These rules\
    \ MAY alternatively be installed on all the\n   interfaces.  If these rules are\
    \ not installed on all the interfaces,\n   clear text or malicious OSPFv3 packets\
    \ with the same source and\n   destination addresses as the virtual link end point\
    \ IPv6 addresses\n   will be delivered to OSPFv3.  Though OSPFv3 drops these packets\
    \ as\n   they were not received on the right interface, OSPFv3 receives some\n\
    \   clear text or malicious packets even when the security is enabled.\n   Installing\
    \ these rules on all the interfaces ensures that OSPFv3 does\n   not receive these\
    \ clear text or malicious packets when security is\n   enabled.  On the other\
    \ hand, installing these rules on all the\n   interfaces increases the processing\
    \ overhead on the interfaces where\n   there is no other IPsec processing.  The\
    \ decision of whether to\n   install these rules on all the interfaces or on just\
    \ the interfaces\n   that are connected to the transit area is a private decision\
    \ and\n   doesn't affect the interoperability in any way.  Hence it is an\n  \
    \ implementation choice.\n"

    \ to configure the\n   cryptographic and authentication keys in hexadecimal format\
    \ rather\n   than restricting it to a subset of ASCII characters (letters,\n \

  - "13.  Replay Protection\n   Since it is not possible using the current standards\
    \ to provide\n   complete replay protection while using manual keying, the proposed\n\
    \   solution will not provide protection against replay attacks.\n   Detailed\
    \ analysis of various vulnerabilities of the routing protocols\n   and OSPF in\
    \ particular is discussed in [I3] and [I2].  The conclusion\n   is that replay\
    \ of OSPF packets can cause adjacencies to be disrupted,\n   which can lead to\
    \ a DoS attack on the network.  It can also cause\n   database exchange process\
    \ to occur continuously thus causing CPU\n   overload as well as micro loops in\
    \ the network.\n"
- title: 14.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "14.  Security Considerations\n   This memo discusses the use of IPsec AH and\
    \ ESP headers to provide\n   security to OSPFv3 for IPv6.  Hence, security permeates\
    \ throughout\n   this document.\n   OSPF Security Vulnerabilities Analysis [I2]\
    \ identifies OSPF\n   vulnerabilities in two scenarios -- one with no authentication\
    \ or\n   simple password authentication and the other with cryptographic\n   authentication.\
    \  The solution described in this specification\n   provides protection against\
    \ all the vulnerabilities identified for\n   scenarios with cryptographic authentication\
    \ with the following\n   exceptions:\n   Limitations of manual key:\n   This specification\
    \ mandates the usage of manual keys.  The following\n   are the known limitations\
    \ of the usage of manual keys.\n      o  As the sequence numbers cannot be negotiated,\
    \ replay protection\n         cannot be provided.  This leaves OSPF insecure against\
    \ all the\n         attacks that can be performed by replaying OSPF packets.\n\
    \      o  Manual keys are usually long lived (changing them often is a\n     \
    \    tedious task).  This gives an attacker enough time to discover\n        \
    \ the keys.\n      o  As the administrator is manually configuring the keys, there\
    \ is\n         a chance that the configured keys are weak (there are known\n \
    \        weak keys for DES/3DES at least).\n   Impersonating attacks:\n   The\
    \ usage of the same key on all the OSPF routers connected to a link\n   leaves\
    \ them all insecure against impersonating attacks if any one of\n   the OSPF routers\
    \ is compromised, malfunctioning, or misconfigured.\n   Detailed analysis of various\
    \ vulnerabilities of routing protocols is\n   discussed in [I3].\n"
