- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   A prominent member of the IETF community has developed a\
    \ set of tools\n   to produce statistics about the authors of RFCs and Internet-Drafts.\n\
    \   These tools analyze the documents themselves to produce statistics\n   about\
    \ the documents and their authors.  The goal of the IETF\n   Datatracker enhancements\
    \ described in this document is to provide\n   similar statistics and ensure that\
    \ the software is maintained as part\n   of the IETF information services.  While\
    \ some data may still need to\n   be extracted from the documents themselves,\
    \ as much data as possible\n   should be maintained in the IETF Datatracker database\
    \ [DATATRACKER].\n   Current statistics are available on the web at\n   http://www.arkko.com/tools/docstats.html.\n\
    \   The code that is used to produce these statistics is available at\n   http://www.arkko.com/tools/authorstats.html.\n"
- title: 2.  Purpose
  contents:
  - "2.  Purpose\n   Author statistics allow the community to understand where work\
    \ is\n   being done and by whom.  The statistics make it visible which\n   individuals,\
    \ companies, and geographic regions are the most active\n   contributors.  The\
    \ statistics also show how these are changing over\n   the years.\n   Some of\
    \ the statistics provide \"nice to know\" information; however,\n   others are\
    \ sometimes used to refer to a particular participant's\n   contributions in the\
    \ IETF or used to study trends within IETF work.\n   For instance, the IETF has\
    \ been trying to increase the diversity of\n   participants, and the statistics\
    \ are one way to see the impact of\n   those efforts.  Also, the most active individuals\
    \ are potential\n   candidates for various leadership positions.\n"

  contents:
  - "3.  Statistics\n   The enhancements to the IETF Datatracker shall provide statistics\
    \ and\n   graphs about documents, document authors, author affiliation, author\n\
    \   country, and author continent.\n   The statistics should also include trends\
    \ relating to IETF meeting\n   attendees, which the current tools do not track.\n\
    \   For the purposes of these requirements, \"recent Internet-Drafts\" and\n \
    \  \"recent RFCs\" cover documents that have been published in the last\n   five\
    \ years.\n"

- title: 5.  Existing Code
  contents:
  - "5.  Existing Code\n   Since the new code will be driven by the Datatracker database\
    \ to the\n   greatest extent possible, the existing code may be of limited value.\n\
    \   The existing code was intended as a temporary solution and requires a\n  \
    \ rewrite.  However, a set of heuristics used by the code may be\n   useful. \
    \ These heuristics are provided in a separate rule database\n   and are used as\
    \ a last resort when there is otherwise too little\n   information.  The heuristics\
    \ include author aliases, some recognized\n   authors and some recognized affiliations,\
    \ domain name data for\n   determining location and affiliation, and mappings\
    \ for some ways that\n   people represent their countries in a post address.\n\
    \   Authors are not consistent about the way their names appear in\n   various\
    \ documents.  For example, one document may include their given\n   name and another\
    \ document may include a nickname.  The Datatracker\n   database provides a way\
    \ to capture aliases, but not all of the\n   aliases in the documents have been\
    \ added to the database.\n   The current Datatracker database does not have tables\
    \ for heuristics\n   other than author aliases that are used in the current tool.\n\
    \   Appropriate tables to hold the additional heuristics from the current\n  \
    \ rule database should be added to the Datatracker database in a manner\n   agreed\
    \ by the group of people that maintain the Datatracker source\n   code.\n   A\
    \ workable web interface, possibly using Django Admin, to update the\n   new heuristics\
    \ tables shall be provided.\n   The current code can be found at\n   http://www.arkko.com/tools/authorstats.html\
    \ and is openly available\n   but without any warranty.\n   The software is split\
    \ in two parts, with the code itself being\n   separate from the heuristics database.\
    \  The two main components of\n   the code are authorstats, which produces the\
    \ statistics and generates\n   the statistics web pages, and getauthors, which\
    \ performs document\n   analysis.\n"
- title: 6.  Deployment
  contents:
  - "6.  Deployment\n   The current tools analyze the documents themselves to produce\n\
    \   statistics.  Some of the data needed to produce the statistics is not\n  \
    \ currently in the Datatracker database.  This development effort will\n   include\
    \ adding the capability to capture this data in the Datatracker\n   database and\
    \ populate it for all RFCs and Internet-Drafts posted over\n   the last five years.\
    \  It may be cost-effective to leverage the\n   existing code to extract the information\
    \ and then verify it one time.\n   The URLs for the current tools exist in many\
    \ places in the Web.  Once\n   a suitable replacement tool is available, the author\
    \ of the original\n   tools has promised to provide a suitable form of redirection.\n"
- title: 7.  Thoughts on Future Enhancements
  contents:
  - "7.  Thoughts on Future Enhancements\n   With the planned change in document format,\
    \ some of the information\n   obtained through heuristics might be more directly\
    \ extracted from the\n   XML file.  Once this format is being used by a significant\
    \ number of\n   authors, a future effort might move away from heuristics toward\n\
    \   extraction from the XML file.  To support this approach, it would be\n   desirable\
    \ for the new XML schema to make the author's continent of\n   residence available,\
    \ even if it not used in the formatting of the\n   human-readable document.\n\
    \   Currently, the Datatracker has information about document authors,\n   but\
    \ not other contributors.  If information is added to the\n   Datatracker in the\
    \ future to cover contributors, then the statistics\n   can be expanded to cover\
    \ contributors as well as authors.\n"
