  - "1.  Introduction\n   ATM-Based Multi-Pair Bonding, a.k.a. G.Bond/ATM, is specified\
    \ in\n   ITU-T Recommendation G.998.1 [G.998.1], which defines a method for\n\
    \   bonding (or aggregating) multiple xDSL lines (or individual bearer\n   channels\
    \ in multiple xDSL lines) into a single bidirectional logical\n   link carrying\
    \ an ATM stream.\n   This specification can be viewed as an evolution of the legacy\n\
    \   Inverse Multiplexing for ATM (IMA) technology [AF-PHY-0086], applied\n   to\
    \ xDSL with variable rates on each line/bearer channel.  As with the\n   other\
    \ bonding schemes, ATM bonding also allows bonding of up to 32\n   individual\
    \ sub-layers with variable rates, providing common\n   functionality for the configuration,\
    \ initialization, operation, and\n   monitoring of the bonded link.\n   The MIB\
    \ module defined in this document defines a set of managed\n   objects for the\
    \ management of G.998.1 bonded interfaces, extending\n   the common objects specified\
    \ in the GBOND-MIB module [RFC6765].\n"

  contents:
  - "2.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework\n   For a detailed overview of\
    \ the documents that describe the current\n   Internet-Standard Management Framework,\
    \ please refer to section 7 of\n   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].\n   Managed objects are\
    \ accessed via a virtual information store, termed\n   the Management Information\
    \ Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally\n   accessed through the Simple Network\
    \ Management Protocol (SNMP).\n   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms\
    \ defined in the\n   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies\
    \ a MIB\n   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,\n\
    \   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580\n   [RFC2580].\n\

- title: 4.  Relationship to Other MIB Modules
  contents:
  - "4.  Relationship to Other MIB Modules\n   This section outlines the relationship\
    \ of the MIB modules defined in\n   this document with other MIB modules described\
    \ in the relevant RFCs.\n   Specifically, the following MIB modules are discussed:\
    \ the Interfaces\n   Group MIB (IF-MIB) and the G.Bond MIB (GBOND-MIB).\n"
- title: 4.1.  Relationship to Interfaces Group MIB Module
  contents:
  - "4.1.  Relationship to Interfaces Group MIB Module\n   A G.Bond/ATM port is a\
    \ private case of a bonded multi-pair xDSL\n   interface and as such is managed\
    \ using generic interface management\n   objects defined in the IF-MIB [RFC2863].\
    \  In particular, an interface\n   index (ifIndex) is used to index instances\
    \ of G.Bond/ATM ports, as\n   well as xDSL lines/channels, in a managed system.\n"
- title: 4.2.  Relationship to G.Bond MIB Module
  contents:
  - "4.2.  Relationship to G.Bond MIB Module\n   The GBOND-MIB module [RFC6765] defines\
    \ management objects common for\n   all bonded multi-pair xDSL interfaces.  In\
    \ particular, it describes\n   the bonding management, bonded port and channel\
    \ configuration,\n   initialization sequence, etc.\n   Both the GBOND-MIB and\
    \ G9981-MIB modules are REQUIRED to manage a\n   G.Bond/ATM port.\n"
- title: 4.3.  Relationship to ATM MIB Module
  contents:
  - "4.3.  Relationship to ATM MIB Module\n   The ATM-MIB [RFC2515] module defines\

- title: 5.1.  Overview
  contents:
  - "5.1.  Overview\n   All management objects defined in the G9981-MIB module are\
    \ contained\n   in a single group g9981Port.  This group is further split into\
    \ 4\n   sub-groups, structured as recommended by RFC 4181 [RFC4181]:\n   o  g9981PortNotifications\
    \ - containing notifications (Up/Downstream\n      Differential Delay Tolerance\
    \ Exceeded).\n   o  g9981PortConfTable - containing objects for configuration\
    \ of a\n      G.Bond/ATM port.\n   o  g9981PortStatusTable - containing objects\
    \ providing overall status\n      information of a G.Bond/ATM port, complementing\
    \ the generic status\n      information from the ifTable of the IF-MIB and the\
    \ gBondFltStatus\n      of the GBOND-MIB.\n   o  g9981PM - containing objects\
    \ providing historical Performance\n      Monitoring (PM) information of a G.Bond/ATM\
    \ port, complementing\n      the PM information from the gBondPortPM of the GBOND-MIB.\n\
    \   Note that the rest of the objects for the Generic Bonding Sub-layer\n   (GBS)\
    \ port configuration, capabilities, status, notifications, and\n   Performance\
    \ Monitoring are located in the GBOND-MIB module.\n"
- title: 5.2.  Performance Monitoring
  contents:
  - "5.2.  Performance Monitoring\n   The OPTIONAL Performance Monitoring counters,\
    \ thresholds, and history\n   buckets (interval-counters) are implemented using\
    \ the textual\n   conventions defined in the HC-PerfHist-TC-MIB [RFC3705].  The\n\
    \   HC-PerfHist-TC-MIB defines 64-bit versions of the textual conventions\n  \
    \ found in the PerfHist-TC-MIB [RFC3593].\n   The agent SHOULD align the beginning\
    \ of each interval to a fifteen-\n   minute boundary of a wall clock.  Likewise,\
    \ the beginning of each\n   one-day interval SHOULD be aligned with the start\
    \ of a day.\n   Counters are not reset when a GBS is re-initialized, but rather\
    \ only\n   when the agent is reset or re-initialized.\n   Note that the accumulation\
    \ of certain performance events for a\n   monitored entity is inhibited (counting\
    \ stops) during periods of\n   service unavailability on that entity.  The DESCRIPTION\
    \ clause of\n   Performance Monitoring counters in this MIB module specifies which\
    \ of\n   the counters are inhibited during periods of service unavailability.\n"

  - "7.  Security Considerations\n   There are a number of managed objects defined\
    \ in this MIB module with\n   a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write.  Such objects\
    \ may be considered\n   sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.\
    \  The support\n   for SET operations in a non-secure environment without proper\n\
    \   protection can have a negative effect on network operations.  These\n   are\
    \ the tables and objects and their sensitivity/vulnerability:\n   o  Changing\
    \ of g9981PortConfTable configuration parameters MAY lead\n      to a potential\
    \ Service Level Agreement (SLA) breach, for example,\n      if a traffic delay\
    \ is increased as a result of the higher delay\n      tolerance (increased g9981PortConfUpDiffDelayTolerance\
    \ and/or\n      g9981PortConfDnDiffDelayTolerance), or the differential delay\n\
    \      tolerance notifications are disabled by manipulating the\n      g9981PortConfDiffDelayToleranceExceededEnable\
    \ parameter.\n   Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects\
    \ with a\n   MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered sensitive\
    \ or\n   vulnerable in some network environments since, collectively, they\n \
    \  provide information about the performance of network interfaces and\n   can\
    \ reveal some aspects of their configuration.\n   It is thus important to control\
    \ even GET and/or NOTIFY access to\n   these objects and possibly to even encrypt\
    \ the values of these\n   objects when sending them over the network via SNMP.\n\
    \   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.\n   Even\
    \ if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPsec),\n   there is no\
    \ control as to who on the secure network is allowed to\n   access and GET/SET\
    \ (read/change/create/delete) the objects in this\n   MIB module.\n   Implementations\
    \ SHOULD provide the security features described by the\n   SNMPv3 framework (see\
    \ [RFC3410]), and implementations claiming\n   compliance to the SNMPv3 standard\
    \ MUST include full support for\n   authentication and privacy via the User-based\
    \ Security Model (USM)\n   [RFC3414] with the AES cipher algorithm [RFC3826].\
    \  Implementations\n   MAY also provide support for the Transport Security Model\
    \ (TSM)\n   [RFC5591] in combination with a secure transport such as SSH\n   [RFC5592]\
    \ or TLS/DTLS [RFC6353].\n   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3\
    \ is NOT\n   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to\n\
    \   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator\n   responsibility\
    \ to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an\n   instance of this MIB\
    \ module is properly configured to give access to\n   the objects only to those\
    \ principals (users) that have legitimate\n   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete)\
    \ them.\n"
