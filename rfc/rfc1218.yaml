  - "Summary\n   This RFC is a near-verbatim copy of a document, known as NADF-123,\n\
    \   which has been produced by the North American Directory Forum (NADF).\n  \
    \ The NADF is a collection of organizations which offer, or plan to\n   offer,\
    \ public Directory services in North America, based on the CCITT\n   X.500 Recommendations.\
    \  As a part of its charter, the NADF must reach\n   agreement as to how entries\
    \ are named in the public portions of the\n   North American Directory.  NADF-123\
    \ is a scheme proposed for this\n   purpose.  The NADF is circulating NADF-123\
    \ widely, expressly for the\n   purpose of gathering comments.  The next meeting\
    \ of the NADF is in\n   mid-July, and it is important for comments to be received\
    \ prior to\n   the meeting, so that the scheme may receive adequate review.\n\

- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   Computer networks form the infrastructure between the users\
    \ they\n   interconnect.  For example, the electronic mail service offered by\n\
    \   computer networks provides a means for users to collaborate towards\n   some\
    \ common goal.  In the simplest cases, this collaboration may be\n   solely for\
    \ the dissemination of information.  In other cases, two\n   users may work on\
    \ a joint research project, using electronic mail as\n   their primary means of\
    \ communication.\n   However, networks themselves are built on an underlying naming\
    \ and\n   numbering infrastructure, usually in the form of names and addresses.\n\
    \   For example, some authority must exist to assign network addresses to\n  \
    \ ensure that numbering collisions do not occur.  This is of paramount\n   importance\
    \ for an environment which consists of multiple service\n   providers.\n"
- title: 2.  Approach
  contents:
  - "2.  Approach\n   It should be observed that there are several different naming\n\
    \   universes that can be realized in the Directory Information Tree\n   (DIT).\
    \  For example, geographical naming, community naming, political\n   naming, organizational\
    \ naming, and so on.  The choice of naming\n   universe largely determines the\
    \ difficulty in mapping a user's query\n   into a series of Directory operations.\
    \  Although it is possible to\n   simultaneously support multiple naming universes\
    \ with the DIT, this\n   is likely to be unnatural.  As such, this proposal focuses\
    \ on a\n   single naming universe.\n   The naming universe in this proposal is\
    \ based on civil authority.\n   That is, it uses the existing civil naming infrastructure\
    \ and\n   suggests a (nearly) straight-forward mapping on the DIT.  There are\n\
    \   four components to the naming architecture:\n   (1)  civil naming and optimized\
    \ civil naming, which reflects\n        names assigned by civil authority;\n \
    \  (2)  organizational naming, which reflects names assigned\n        within organizations;\n\
    \   (3)  ADDMD naming, which reflects names assigned to public\n        providers\
    \ within the Directory service; and,\n   (4)  application naming, which reflects\
    \ names assigned to OSI\n        entities.\n   An important characteristic is\
    \ that entries should be listed wherever\n   searches for them are likely to occur.\
    \  This implies that a single\n   object may be listed under several entries.\n"
- title: 2.1.  Names and User-Friendliness
  contents:
  - "2.1.  Names and User-Friendliness\n   It must be emphasized that there are three\
    \ distinct concepts which\n   are often confused when discussing a naming scheme:\n\
    \   (1)  user-friendly naming: a property of a Directory which\n        allows\
    \ users to easily identity objects;\n   (2)  user-friendly name: a technique for\
    \ naming an object\n        which exhibits \"friendliness\" according to an arbitrary\n\
    \        set of user-criteria; and,\n   (3)  Distinguished Name: the administratively\
    \ assigned name\n        for an entry in the OSI Directory.\n   It must be emphasized\
    \ that Distinguished Names are not necessarily\n   user-friendly names, and further,\
    \ that user-friendly naming in the\n   Directory is a property of the Directory\
    \ Service, not of\n   Distinguished Names.\n"
- title: 2.2.  Choice of RDN Names
  contents:
  - "2.2.  Choice of RDN Names\n   The key aspect to appreciate for choice of RDNs\
    \ is that they should\n   provide a large name space to avoid collisions: the\
    \ naming strategy\n   must provide enough \"real estate\" to accommodate a large\
    \ demand for\n   entries.  This is the primary requirement for RDNs.  A secondary\n\
    \   requirement is that RDNs should be meaningful (friendly to people)\n   and\
    \ should not impede searching.\n   However, it is important to understand that\
    \ this second requirement\n   can be achieved by using additional (non-distinguished)\
    \ attribute\n   values.  For example, if the RDN of an entry is\n            \
    \    organizationName is Performance Systems International\n   then it is perfectly\
    \ acceptable (and indeed desirable) to have other\n   values for the organizationName\
    \ attribute, e.g.,\n                organizationName is PSI\n   The use of these\
    \ abbreviated names greatly aids searching whilst\n   avoiding unnecessary Distinguished\
    \ Name conflicts.\n   In order to appreciate the naming scheme which follows,\
    \ it is\n   important to understand that it leverages, wherever possible,\n  \
    \ existing naming infrastructure.  That is, it relies heavily on non-\n   OSI\
    \ naming authorities which already exist.  Note that inasmuch as it\n   relies\
    \ on existing naming authorities, there is little chance that\n   any \"final\"\
    \ national decision could obsolete it.  [Footnote: Any\n   naming scheme may be\
    \ subject to the jurisdiction of certain national\n   agencies.  For example,\
    \ the US State Department is concerned with any\n   impact on US telecommunications\
    \ treaty obligations.] (To do so would\n   require a national decision that disregards\
    \ existing national and\n   regional infrastructure, and establishes some entirely\
    \ new and\n   different national naming infrastructure.)\n"

    \ how an interrogation algorithm might locate a residential\n   person, given:\n\
    \   (1)  a string denoting the person's real-world name;\n   (2)  a string denoting\
    \ the real-world name of the populated\n        place in which the person lives;\
    \ and,\n   (3)  the Distinguished Name of the state or state-equivalent.\n   A\
    \ straight-forward approach is to initiate a single-level search to\n   locate\
    \ the desired populated place.  The search results in zero or\n   more Distinguished\
    \ Names being returned which correspond to the\n   string provided by the user.\
    \  Then, for each populated place, a\n   subtree search might be initiated to\
    \ locate the desired residential\n   person.  If the number of populated places\
    \ returned by the first\n   search is large, then this strategy is inefficient.\n\
    \   A better approach would be to initiate a single search, with a filter\n  \
    \ combining the strings for both the person's real-world name and the\n   place's\
    \ real-world name.  Unfortunately, such a search would have to\n   involve the\
    \ whole-subtree anchored at the Distinguished Name for the\n   state or state-equivalent,\
    \ which would be inefficient.\n   As such, it may be desirable to optimize the\
    \ civil naming component\n   by listing some entries at a higher level.  This\
    \ is accomplished by\n   using a multi-valued RDN formed by combining the RDNs\
    \ of the entry\n   and its superior.\n   There are three cases in civil naming:\n\
    \   (1)  listing an organization with regional standing at the\n        national\
    \ level;\n   (2)  listing an organization with local standing at the\n       \
    \ regional level; and,\n   (3)  listing a person with local standing at the regional\n\
    \        level.\n   Hence, under the optimized civil naming component, a single-level\n\
    \   search, anchored at the Distinguished Name for the state or state-\n   equivalent,\
    \ could be used.  Further, the implementation of a DSA\n   supporting this optimization\
    \ would highly-index the attributes used\n   for searching, in order to achieve\
    \ high-performance.\n   In order to clearly indicate that optimized civil naming\
    \ is in\n   effect, a new attribute type, nadfSearchGuide, is introduced.  An\n\
    \   attribute value of this type is placed in an entry to indicate which\n   optimizations\
    \ are in effect.  Using the residential example above,\n   the entry for the state\
    \ or state-equivalent would contain an\n   nadfSearchGuide value indicating that\
    \ when searching for entries of\n   type residentialPerson, a single-level search\
    \ should be performed\n   with a filter containing the logical-and of two terms,\
    \ one involving\n   the commonName attribute, and the other involving the localityName\n\
    \   attribute.  The nadfSearchGuide is a refinement of the X.500\n   searchGuide\
    \ in that it indicates the depth of the search which should\n   be performed,\
    \ and always contains an indication of the object class\n   for which the optimization\
    \ exists.\n   Finally, note that for naming within organizations, this technique\n\
    \   might also be used.\n"

  - "Appendix B:  Revision History of this Scheme\n   The first version of this scheme\
    \ (NADF-71) was contributed to the\n   North American Directory Forum at its November\
    \ 27--30, 1990 meeting.\n   The (mis)features were:\n   (1)  Because of the lack\
    \ of confidence in ANSI registration\n        procedures, it was proposed that\
    \ the US trademarks be\n        used as the basis for RDNs of organizations with\n\
    \        national-standing.\n        This proved unworkable since the same trademark\
    \ may be\n        issued to different organizations in different\n        industries.\n\
    \   (2)  There was no pre-existing registry used for populated\n        places.\n\
    \        This proved unworkable since the effort to define a new\n        registry\
    \ is problematic.\n   The second version of this scheme was contributed to the\
    \ ANSI\n   Registration Authority Committee at its January 30, 1991 meeting, and\n\
    \   the IETF OSI Directory Services Working Group at its February 12--13,\n  \
    \ 1991 meeting.  The (mis)features were:\n   (1)  The ANSI numeric name form registry\
    \ was used as the basis\n        for RDNs of organizations with national standings.\n\
    \   (2)  The FIPS 5 state numeric code was used as the basis for\n        RDNs\
    \ of states and state-equivalents.\n   (3)  The FIPS 55 place numeric code was\
    \ used as the basis for\n        RDNs of populated places.\n   The choice of numeric\
    \ rather than alphanumeric name forms was\n   unpopular, but was motivated by\
    \ the desire to avoid using the ANSI\n   alphanumeric name form registry, which\
    \ was perceived as unstable.\n   The third version of this scheme was contributed\
    \ to US State\n   Department Study Group D's MHS-MD subcommittee at its March\
    \ 7--8 1991\n   meeting.  That version used alphanumeric name forms for all objects,\n\
    \   under the perception that the ANSI alphanumeric name form registry\n   will\
    \ prove stable.  If the ANSI alphanumeric name form registry\n   proves unstable,\
    \ then two alternatives are possible:\n   (1)  disallow organizations with national-standing\
    \ in the US\n        portion of the DIT; or,\n   (2)  use the ANSI numeric name\
    \ form registry instead.\n   Hopefully neither of these two undesirable alternatives\
    \ will prove\n   necessary.\n   The fourth version of this scheme (NADF-103) was\
    \ contributed to the\n   North American Directory Forum at its March 18--22, 1990\
    \ meeting.\n   This version introduced the notion of organizations with regional\n\
    \   standing being listed at the national level through the use of alias\n   names\
    \ and multi-valued RDNs.\n   The current (fifth) version of this scheme (NADF-123)\
    \ generalized the\n   listing concept by introducing the notion of optimized civil\
    \ naming.\n   Further, the document was edited to clearly note the different naming\n\
    \   components and the relation between them.\n"
