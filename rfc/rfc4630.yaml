  - "1.  Introduction\n   At the time that RFC 3280 [PKIX1] was published, it was\
    \ very unclear\n   how international character sets ought to be supported.\n \
    \  Implementation experience and deployment experience have made the\n   picture\
    \ much less fuzzy.  This update to RFC 3280 aligns the document\n   with this\
    \ experience and the direction of the IETF PKIX Working\n   Group.\n   The use\
    \ of UTF8String and PrintableString are the preferred encoding.\n   UTF8String\
    \ provides support for international character sets, and\n   PrintableString preserves\
    \ support for the vast bulk of the\n   certificates that have already been deployed.\n"

  contents:
  - "3.  Update to RFC 3280, Section 4.1.2.4: Issuer\n   In Section 4.1.2.4, RFC 3280\
    \ says:\n      The DirectoryString type is defined as a choice of\n      PrintableString,\
    \ TeletexString, BMPString, UTF8String, and\n      UniversalString.  The UTF8String\
    \ encoding [RFC 2279] is the\n      preferred encoding, and all certificates issued\
    \ after December 31,\n      2003 MUST use the UTF8String encoding of DirectoryString\
    \ (except\n      as noted below).  Until that date, conforming CAs MUST choose\
    \ from\n      the following options when creating a distinguished name,\n    \
    \  including their own:\n         (a)  if the character set is sufficient, the\
    \ string MAY be\n              represented as a PrintableString;\n         (b)\
    \  failing (a), if the BMPString character set is sufficient\n              the\
    \ string MAY be represented as a BMPString; and\n         (c)  failing (a) and\
    \ (b), the string MUST be represented as a\n              UTF8String.  If (a)\
    \ or (b) is satisfied, the CA MAY still\n              choose to represent the\
    \ string as a UTF8String.\n   Exceptions to the December 31, 2003 UTF8 encoding\
    \ requirements\n   are as follows:\n         (a)  CAs MAY issue \"name rollover\"\
    \ certificates to support an\n              orderly migration to UTF8String encoding.\
    \  Such\n              certificates would include the CA's UTF8String encoded\n\
    \              name as issuer and the old name encoding as subject,\n        \
    \      or vice-versa.\n         (b)  As stated in section 4.1.2.6, the subject\
    \ field MUST be\n              populated with a non-empty distinguished name matching\
    \ the\n              contents of the issuer field in all certificates issued by\n\
    \              the subject CA regardless of encoding.\n      The TeletexString\
    \ and UniversalString are included for backward\n      compatibility, and SHOULD\
    \ NOT be used for certificates for new\n      subjects.  However, these types\
    \ MAY be used in certificates where\n      the name was previously established.\
    \  Certificate users SHOULD be\n      prepared to receive certificates with these\
    \ types.\n      In addition, many legacy implementations support names encoded\
    \ in\n      the ISO 8859-1 character set (Latin1String) [ISO 8859-1] but tag\n\
    \      them as TeletexString.  TeletexString encodes a larger character\n    \
    \  set than ISO 8859-1, but it encodes some characters differently.\n      Implementations\
    \ SHOULD be prepared to handle both encodings.\n   This block of text is replaced\
    \ with the following:\n      The DirectoryString type is defined as a choice of\n\
    \      PrintableString, TeletexString, BMPString, UTF8String, and\n      UniversalString.\
    \  CAs conforming to this profile MUST use either\n      the PrintableString or\
    \ UTF8String encoding of DirectoryString,\n      with one exception.  When CAs\
    \ have previously issued certificates\n      with issuer fields with attributes\
    \ encoded using the\n      TeletexString, BMPString, or UniversalString, the CA\
    \ MAY continue\n      to use these encodings of the DirectoryString to preserve\
    \ the\n      backward compatibility.\n"
- title: '4.  Update to RFC 3280, Section 4.1.2.6: Subject'
  contents:
  - "4.  Update to RFC 3280, Section 4.1.2.6: Subject\n   In Section 4.1.2.6, RFC\
    \ 3280 says:\n      The subject name field is defined as the X.501 type Name.\n\
    \      Implementation requirements for this field are those defined for\n    \
    \  the issuer field (section 4.1.2.4).  When encoding attribute\n      values\
    \ of type DirectoryString, the encoding rules for the issuer\n      field MUST\
    \ be implemented.\n   This block of text is replaced with the following:\n   \
    \   The subject name field is defined as the X.501 type Name.\n      Implementation\
    \ requirements for this field are those defined for\n      the issuer field (Section\
    \ 4.1.2.4).  CAs conforming to this\n      profile MUST use either the PrintableString\
    \ or UTF8String encoding\n      of DirectoryString, with one exception.  When\
    \ CAs have previously\n      issued certificates with subject fields with attributes\
    \ encoded\n      using the TeletexString, BMPString, or UniversalString, the CA\
    \ MAY\n      continue to use these encodings of the DirectoryString in new\n \
    \     certificates for the same subject to preserve backward\n      compatibility.\n\
    \      Since name comparison assumes that attribute values encoded in\n      different\
    \ types (e.g., PrintableString and UTF8String) are assumed\n      to represent\
    \ different strings, any name components that appear in\n      both the subject\
    \ field and the issuer field SHOULD use the same\n      encoding throughout the\
    \ certification path.\n"

  contents:
  - "5.  Update to RFC 3280, Section 4.2.1.7: Subject Alternative Name\n   In Section\
    \ 4.2.1.7, RFC 3280 says:\n      When the subjectAltName extension contains a\
    \ DN in the\n      directoryName, the DN MUST be unique for each subject entity\n\
    \      certified by the one CA as defined by the issuer name field.  A CA\n  \
    \    MAY issue more than one certificate with the same DN to the same\n      subject\
    \ entity.\n   This block of text is replaced with the following:\n      When the\
    \ subjectAltName extension contains a DN in the\n      directoryName, the encoding\
    \ preference is defined in Section\n      4.1.2.4.  The DN MUST be unique for\
    \ each subject entity certified\n      by the one CA as defined by the issuer\
    \ name field.  A CA MAY issue\n      more than one certificate with the same DN\
    \ to the same subject\n      entity.\n"
- title: 6.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "6.  Security Considerations\n   The use of consistent encoding for name components\
    \ will ensure that\n   the name constraints specified in [PKIX1] work as expected.\n\
    \   When strings are mapped from internal representations to visual\n   representations,\
    \ sometimes two different strings will have the same\n   or similar visual representations.\
    \  This can happen for many\n   different reasons, including the use of similar\
    \ glyphs and use of\n   composed characters (such as e + ' equaling U+00E9, the\
    \ Korean\n   composed characters, and vowels above consonant clusters in certain\n\
    \   languages).  As a result of this situation, people doing visual\n   comparisons\
    \ between to different names may think they are the same\n   when in fact they\
    \ are not.  Also, people may mistake one string for\n   another.  Issuers of certificates\
    \ and relying parties both need to be\n   aware of this situation.\n"
