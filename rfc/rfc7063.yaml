- title: 1.1.  Overview of PIM-SM
  contents:
  - "1.1.  Overview of PIM-SM\n   Protocol Independent Multicast - Sparse Mode (PIM-SM)\
    \ was first\n   published as [RFC2117] in 1997.  This version was then obsoleted\
    \ by\n   [RFC2362] in 1998.  The protocol was classified as Experimental in\n\
    \   both documents.  The protocol specification was then rewritten in\n   whole\
    \ and advanced to Proposed Standard as [RFC4601] in 2006.\n   Considering its\
    \ multiple independent implementations developed and\n   sufficient successful\
    \ operational experience gained, the PIM WG\n   decided to advance the PIM-SM\
    \ protocol to Internet Standard.  The\n   conducted survey and this document are\
    \ part of the work.\n"
- title: 1.2.  Requirements of RFCs 2026 and 6410
  contents:
  - "1.2.  Requirements of RFCs 2026 and 6410\n   [RFC2026] defines the stages in\
    \ the standardization process, the\n   requirements for moving a document between\
    \ stages, and the types of\n   documents used during this process.  Section 4.1.2\
    \ of [RFC2026]\n   states that:\n      The requirement for at least two independent\
    \ and interoperable\n      implementations applies to all of the options and features\
    \ of the\n      specification.  In cases in which one or more options or features\n\
    \      have not been demonstrated in at least two interoperable\n      implementations,\
    \ the specification may advance to the Draft\n      Standard level only if those\
    \ options or features are removed.\n   [RFC6410] updates the IETF Standards Process\
    \ defined in [RFC2026].\n   Primarily, it reduces the Standards Process from three\
    \ Standards\n   Track maturity levels to two.  The second maturity level is a\n\
    \   combination of Draft Standard and Standard as specified in [RFC2026].\n  \
    \ Section 2.2 of [RFC6410] states that:\n      (1) There are at least two independent\
    \ interoperating\n      implementations with widespread deployment and successful\n\
    \      operational experience.\n      (2)...\n      (3) There are no unused features\
    \ in the specification that greatly\n      increase implementation complexity.\n\
    \   Optional features that do not meet the aforesaid criteria have been\n   identified\
    \ by the PIM Working Group and will be removed.  This\n   document provides supporting\
    \ documentation to advance the IETF\n   stream's Protocol Independent Multicast\
    \ - Sparse Mode (PIM-SM)\n   protocol from Proposed Standard to Internet Standard.\n"

- title: 2.1.  Methodology
  contents:
  - "2.1.  Methodology\n   A questionnaire was issued by the PIM WG co-chairs and\
    \ announced\n   widely to the vendors and operational community to obtain information\n\
    \   on PIM-SM implementations and deployments.  The survey concluded on\n   22\
    \ Oct 2012.  The responses remain confidential and only combined\n   results are\
    \ published here, while responders chose whether to keep\n   their affiliations\
    \ confidential.  The raw questionnaire is shown in\n   Appendix A, and a compilation\
    \ of the responses is included in the\n   following section.\n"
- title: 2.2.  Operator Responses
  contents:
  - "2.2.  Operator Responses\n   Nine operators responded to the survey.  They are\
    \ SWITCH, National\n   Research Council Canada, South Dakota School of Mines and\
    \ Technology,\n   Motorola Solutions, and five anonymous operators.\n"
- title: 2.2.1.  Description of PIM-SM Deployments
  contents:
  - "2.2.1.  Description of PIM-SM Deployments\n   Since 1998, PIM-SM has been deployed\
    \ for a wide variety of\n   applications: Campus, Enterprise, Research and WAN\
    \ networks,\n   Broadband ISP, and Digital TV.  There are five deployments based\
    \ on\n   [RFC4601] implementations and two on [RFC2362] implementations.  PIM-\n\
    \   SM for IPv6 has been deployed by three operators.  Out of the nine\n   operators,\
    \ six have deployed PIM-SM implementations from multiple\n   vendors.\n   Operators\
    \ reported minor interoperability issues and these were\n   addressed by the vendors.\
    \  There was no major interoperability\n   concern reported by the operators.\n"
- title: 2.2.2.  PIM-SM Deployment with Other Multicast Technologies
  contents:
  - "2.2.2.  PIM-SM Deployment with Other Multicast Technologies\n   Except for one\
    \ deployment of PIM-SM with Multicast Extensions to OSPF\n   (MOSPF), all other\
    \ operators have deployed PIM-SM exclusively.  No\n   operators acknowledged deployments\
    \ of either (*,*,RP) or PIM\n   Multicast Border Route (PMBR) for interconnection\
    \ between PIM-SM and\n   other multicast domains.\n"
- title: 2.2.3.   PIM-SM Rendezvous Points (RPs) and RP Discovery Mechanisms
  contents:
  - "2.2.3.   PIM-SM Rendezvous Points (RPs) and RP Discovery Mechanisms\n   The number\
    \ of PIM-SM RPs deployed by operators ranges from a few\n   (e.g., sixteen) to\
    \ a massively scaled number (four hundred).  Both\n   static configuration and\
    \ Bootstrap Router (BSR) have been deployed as\n   RP discovery mechanisms.\n\
    \   Anycast-RP has been deployed for RP redundancy.  Two operators have\n   deployed\
    \ Anycast-RP using the Multicast Source Discovery Protocol\n   (MSDP) [RFC3446].\
    \  Three operators have deployed Anycast-RP using\n   both MSDP [RFC3446] and\
    \ PIM [RFC4610] for different scenarios.  The\n   best common practice seems to\
    \ be to use static-RP configuration with\n   Anycast-RP for redundancy.\n"
- title: 2.3.  Vendor Responses
  contents:
  - "2.3.  Vendor Responses\n   Eight vendors reported PIM-SM implementations.  They\
    \ are XORP, Huawei\n   Technologies, Cisco Systems, Motorola Solutions, Juniper\
    \ Networks,\n   and three other anonymous vendors.\n"
- title: 2.3.1.  Implementations Based on RFCs 4601 and 2362
  contents:
  - "2.3.1.  Implementations Based on RFCs 4601 and 2362\n   Four vendors reported\
    \ PIM-SM implementations based on [RFC4601] and\n   two reported PIM-SM implementations\
    \ based on [RFC2362].  Two other\n   reported implementations are hybrids.\n \
    \  Minor interoperability issues have been addressed by the vendors over\n   the\
    \ years and no concerns were reported by any vendor.\n"
- title: 2.3.2.  Lack of (*,*,RP) and PMBR Implementations
  contents:
  - "2.3.2.  Lack of (*,*,RP) and PMBR Implementations\n   Most vendors have not implemented\
    \ (*,*,RP) state as specified in\n   [RFC4601] either due to lack of deployment\
    \ requirements or due to\n   security concerns.  Similarly, most vendors have\
    \ also not implemented\n   PMBR due to lack of deployment requirements or because\
    \ it was\n   considered too complex and non-scalable.\n   Only one vendor, XORP,\
    \ reported (*,*,RP) and PMBR implementation and\n   they were implemented just\
    \ because these were part of the [RFC4601]\n   specification.\n"
- title: 2.3.3.  Implementations of Other Features of RFC 4601
  contents:
  - "2.3.3.  Implementations of Other Features of RFC 4601\n   Most vendors have implemented\
    \ all of the following from the [RFC4601]\n   specification:\n   o  Source-Specific\
    \ Multicast (SSM)\n   o  Join suppression\n   o  Explicit tracking\n   o  Register\
    \ mechanism\n   o  Shortest Path Tree (SPT) switchover at last-hop router\n  \
    \ o  Assert mechanism\n   o  Hashing of group to RP mappings\n   Some vendors\
    \ do not implement explicit tracking and SSM.\n"
- title: 2.4.  Key Findings
  contents:
  - "2.4.  Key Findings\n   PIM-SM has been widely implemented and deployed for different\n\
    \   applications.  The protocol is sufficiently well specified in\n   [RFC4601]\
    \ resulting in interoperable implementation deployed by\n   operators.\n   There\
    \ are no deployments and only one known implementation of\n   (*,*,RP) and PMBR\
    \ as specified in [RFC4601].  Hence, it is necessary\n   to remove these features\
    \ from the specification as required by\n   [RFC2026] and [RFC6410].\n"
- title: 3.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "3.  Security Considerations\n   The PIM WG is aware of at least three (and believes\
    \ there are more)\n   PIM-SM implementations that support the use of IPsec to\
    \ protect PIM\n   messages.  For at least one of them, IPsec is not part of the\
    \ PIM\n   implementation itself -- one just configures IPsec with Security\n \
    \  Policy Databases (SPDs) where interface, the ALL_PIM_ROUTERS\n   multicast\
    \ address, etc., can be used as selectors, according to\n   [RFC5796].\n"
