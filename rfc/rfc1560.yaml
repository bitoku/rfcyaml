  - "Abstract\n   This document was prepared by the authors on behalf of the Internet\n\
    \   Architecture Board (IAB).  It is offered by the IAB to stimulate\n   discussion.\n\
    \   There has recently been considerable discussion on two topics:\n   MultiProtocol\
    \ approaches in the Internet and the selection of a next\n   generation Internet\
    \ Protocol. This document suggests a strawman\n   position for goals and approaches\
    \ for the IETF/IESG/IAB in these\n   areas. It takes the view that these two topics\
    \ are related, and\n   proposes directions for the IETF/IESG/IAB to pursue.\n\
    \   In particular, it recommends that the IETF/IESG/IAB should continue\n   to\
    \ be a force for consensus on a single protocol suite and internet\n   layer protocol.\
    \ The IETF/IESG/IAB should:\n      - maintain its focus on the TCP/IP protocol\
    \ suite,\n      - work to select a single next-generation internet protocol and\n\
    \        develop mechanisms to aid in transition from the current IPv4,\n    \
    \    and\n      - continue to explore mechanisms to interoperate and share\n \
    \       resources with other protocol suites within the Internet.\n"
- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   The major purpose of the Internet is to enable ubiquitous\n\
    \   communication services between endpoints. In a very real way, the\n   Internet\
    \ IS inter-enterprise networking. Therefore, the issue of\n   multiprotocol Internet\
    \ is not just the issue of multiple network\n   layers, but the issue of multiple\
    \ comparable services implemented\n   over different protocols.\n   The issue\
    \ of multiprotocol Internet is multidimensional and should be\n   analyzed with\
    \ respect to two simultaneous principles:\n      - It is desirable to have a single\
    \ protocol stack. The community\n        should try to avoid unconstrained proliferation\
    \ of various\n        protocol stacks.\n      - In reality there will always be\
    \ more than one protocol stack.\n        Presence of multiple network layers is\
    \ just one of the\n        corollaries of this observation, as even within a single\n\
    \        protocol stack, forces of evolution of that stack will lead\n       \
    \ to periods of multiple protocols.  We need to develop\n        mechanisms that\
    \ maximize the services that can be provided\n        across all the protocol\
    \ stacks (multiprotocol Internet).\n"

    \ Evolution Process\n   The figure describes the process from the perspective\
    \ of a community\n   working on a single primary protocol suite (such as the IETF/IESG/IAB\n\
    \   working on the TCP/IP protocol suite.) (Note: It must be kept in mind\n  \
    \ throughout this paper that, while the discussion is oriented from the\n   perspective\
    \ of the IETF/IESG/IAB and the TCP/IP protocol suite, there\n   is a complementary\
    \ viewpoint from the perspective of each of the\n   communities whose primary\
    \ focus is on one of the other protocol\n   suites.) There are other protocol\
    \ suites (for example, IPX, OSI,\n   SNA).  Although the primary emphasis of the\
    \ community is developing a\n   system based on a single set of protocols (protocol\
    \ suite), the\n   existence of other protocol suites demands that the community\
    \ deal\n   with two aspects of multiprotocolism. The first is interoperability\n\
    \   between the primary protocol suite and other protocol suites. The\n   second\
    \ is resource sharing between the primary protocol suite and\n   other protocol\
    \ suites.  Both interoperability and sharing may happen\n   at multiple levels\
    \ in the protocol suites.\n   Achieving interoperability and resource sharing\
    \ is difficult, and\n   often unanticipated interactions occur. Interoperability\
    \ can be\n   difficult for reasons such as lack of common semantics. Resource\n\
    \   sharing can run into problems due to lack of common operational\n   paradigms.\
    \ For example, sharing bandwidth on a link may not work\n   effectively if one\
    \ protocol suite backs off in its demands and the\n   other does not. Interoperability\
    \ and resource sharing both require\n   cooperation between the developers/users\
    \ of the different protocol\n   suites. The challenge in this area, then, is to\
    \ develop mechanisms\n   for interoperability and resource sharing that have minimal\
    \ negative\n   affect on the primary protocol suite.\n   The very attempts to\
    \ achieve interoperability and resource sharing\n   therefore lead to an attempt\
    \ to bring the multiple protocol suites\n   into some level of harmonization,\
    \ even if it is just to simplify the\n   problems of interoperability and sharing.\
    \ Furthermore, the\n   communications between the communities also leads to a\
    \ level of\n   harmonization. These processes, together with the normal process\
    \ of\n   evolution, lead to changes in the primary protocol suite, as well as\n\
    \   the other suites.\n   Thus, the need for new technologies and the need to\
    \ accommodate\n   multiple protocols leads to a natural process of diversion.\
    \ The\n   process of harmonization leads to conversion.\n   While this discussion\
    \ was oriented around the relation between\n   multiple protocol suites, it can\
    \ also be applied somewhat to the\n   process of evolution within the primary\
    \ protocol suite. So, for\n   example, as new technologies develop, multiple approaches\
    \ for\n   exploiting those technologies will also develop. The process then\n\
    \   hopefully leads to a process of harmonization of those different\n   approaches.\n"
- title: 2.2.  The Basis of the Internet
  contents:
  - "2.2.  The Basis of the Internet\n   The rapid growth of the Internet has resulted\
    \ from several forces.\n   Some of them are \"practical\", such as the bundling\
    \ of TCP/IP with\n   Berkeley Unix and the early decision to base NSFNet on TCP/IP.\n\
    \   However, we believe that there is a more fundamental reason for this\n   growth.\
    \ The Internet (and the TCP/IP protocol suite) were targeted at\n   Inter-Enterprise\
    \ Networking. Although the availability of TCP/IP on\n   workstations and the\
    \ desire to have a single environment serve both\n   intra- and inter-enterprise\
    \ networking led to the use of TCP/IP\n   within organizations, the major contribution\
    \ of the Internet and\n   TCP/IP was to provide to user communities the ability\
    \ to communicate\n   with other organizations/communities in a straightforward\
    \ manner\n   using a set of common and basic services.\n   Fundamental to this\
    \ ability was the fact that the Internet was based\n   on a single, common, virtual\
    \ network service (IP) with a supporting\n   administrative infrastructure. This\
    \ allowed a ubiquitous underlying\n   communication infrastructure to develop\
    \ serving the global community,\n   upon which a set of services could be provided\
    \ to the user\n   communities. This also allowed for a large market to develop\
    \ for\n   application services that were built upon the underlying\n   communications.\n\
    \   An important corollary to having a single common virtual network\n   service\
    \ available to the end user (open network service) is that the\n   selection of\
    \ applications becomes the province of the end-user\n   community rather than\
    \ the intermediate network provider. By having\n   this common underlying infrastructure,\
    \ user communities are able to\n   select their desired/required application services\
    \ based on their\n   unique needs, with assurance that the intermediate networking\
    \ service\n   will support their communication requirements.  We believe that\
    \ this\n   has been of considerable importance in the success of the Internet.\n\
    \   In addition to providing network layer services for TCP/IP transport\n   layer\
    \ and applications, IP may be used to provide network layer\n   services for non-TCP/IP\
    \ transport layer and applications. Such use is\n   clearly beneficial, since\
    \ it allows preservation of all the benefits\n   of a single, common, virtual\
    \ network service (IP), while at the same\n   time widening the set of applications\
    \ available to the end users.\n"
- title: 3.  Directions for Multiprotocolism
  contents:
  - "3.  Directions for Multiprotocolism\n   Over the past few years, with the increasing\
    \ scope of the Internet,\n   has come an increasing need to develop mechanisms\
    \ for accommodating\n   other protocol suites. Most techniques have fallen into\
    \ the regime of\n   either interoperability (techniques that allow for communications\n\
    \   between users of different protocol suites) or resource sharing\n   (allowing\
    \ common resources such as links or switches to jointly\n   service communities\
    \ using different protocol suites.) It must be\n   noted that such techniques\
    \ have been quite limited, with\n   interoperability happening primarily at application\
    \ layers and\n   resource sharing happening to limited extent.\n   This need to\
    \ deal with multiple protocol suites has led to discussion\n   within the community\
    \ concerning the role of the IETF/IESG/IAB\n   regarding the TCP/IP protocol suite\
    \ versus other protocol suites.\n   Questions are asked as to whether the TCP/IP\
    \ protocol suite is the\n   sole domain of interest of the IETF/IESG/IAB or if\
    \ the community\n   needs also to deal with other protocol suites, and if so,\
    \ in what\n   manner, given these other protocol suites have their own communities\n\
    \   of interest pursuing their development and evolution.\n   The answer to this\
    \ question lies in understanding the role of the\n   IETF/IESG/IAB with respect\
    \ to the process described above (Figure 1).\n   The continued success of the\
    \ Internet relies on a continued strong\n   force for convergence, making sure\
    \ that the primary protocol suite\n   (TCP/IP) is successful through an evolutionary\
    \ process in\n   accommodating both the changing user requirements and emerging\n\
    \   technologies.\n   Since this process requires a continued effort to accommodate\
    \ other\n   protocol suites within the overall Internet, efforts at\n   interoperability\
    \ and sharing must continue. Thus, we can summarize\n   the directions for the\
    \ IETF/IESG/IAB as two-fold:\n      - Have as a primary focus the evolution of\
    \ the primary protocol\n        suite (TCP/IP), acting as a force for convergence\
    \ at all times\n        towards a single set of protocols, and\n      - Make provision\
    \ for other protocol suites within the global\n        Internet through mechanisms\
    \ for interoperability and resource\n        sharing.\n"
- title: 4.  Next Generation Internet Protocol
  contents:
  - "4.  Next Generation Internet Protocol\n   The principles described above for\
    \ multiprotocolism can also be\n   applied to the discussions regarding the next\
    \ generation internet\n   protocol. Currently, there are several candidates for\
    \ IPng, which\n   raises the question of how to deal with multiple protocols at\
    \ that\n   level. We note that even if just one is selected, there is an issue\n\
    \   involved in transitioning from IPv4 to IPng.\n   Selection of a single Internet\
    \ protocol is not the only way of\n   dealing with this issue. Even if a layer\
    \ of ubiquity is required\n   (such as that provided currently by IP), we might\
    \ consider providing\n   ubiquity at a different layer. For example, we could\
    \ imagine having a\n   common transport protocol running over multiple internet\
    \ protocols.\n   We also could imagine achieving interoperability by use of common\n\
    \   application services (such as directory services) running over\n   diverse\
    \ communication services (both transport and network layers).\n   These alternatives\
    \ do not provide the considerable benefits of a\n   single internet protocol,\
    \ and therefore would be undesirable.  Having\n   a single internet protocol provides\
    \ a common communication\n   infrastructure across the various networks, thereby\
    \ achieving the\n   following:\n      - Communities of end users can select their\
    \ desired applications,\n        independent of the technologies used to support\
    \ the intermediate\n        networks.\n      - The common underlying infrastructure\
    \ provides a common\n        marketplace upon which application developers can\
    \ create new and\n        exciting applications. Installation of these applications\
    \ does\n        not require end users to select a corresponding network protocol\n\
    \        (although some advanced applications may require enhancements,\n    \
    \    such as high-bandwidth approaches).\n   Thus, the community (IETF/IESG/IAB)\
    \ should continue to act as a force\n   for convergence by selecting a single\
    \ next generation Internet\n   protocol and developing methods to ease the transition\
    \ from IPv4 to\n   IPng. Specifically, at the applications layer, it is desirable\
    \ to\n   promote different approaches and \"let the marketplace decide.\"\n  \
    \ However, it is unacceptable to treat the internet protocol layer in\n   the\
    \ same way.\n"

  - "5.  Conclusion\n   Historically, the IETF/IESG/IAB has acted as a strong force\
    \ for the\n   development of the Internet by acting as a force for convergence\

    \   the community well, and this approach should be continued for the\n   future.\
    \  In particular, the IETF/IESG/IAB should:\n      - maintain its focus on the\
