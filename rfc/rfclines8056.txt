Abstract This document describes the mapping of the Extensible Provisioning Protocol (EPP) statuses with the statuses registered for use in the Registration Data Access Protocol (RDAP).
This document identifies gaps in the mapping, and registers RDAP statuses to fill those gaps to ensure that all of the EPP statuses specified in RFCs are supported in RDAP.
This document maps the statuses defined in the Extensible Provisioning Protocol (EPP) RFCs to the list of statuses registered for use in the Registration Data Access Protocol (RDAP), in the "RDAP JSON Values" registry [rdap json values].
The "RDAP JSON Values" registry is described in Section 10.2 of [RFC7483] and is available in the "RDAP JSON Values" registry [rdap json values].
The EPP statuses used as the source of the mapping include Section 2.3 of the Extensible Provisioning Protocol (EPP)
Domain Name Mapping [RFC5731], Section 2.3 of "Extensible Provisioning Protocol (EPP)
Host Mapping" [RFC5732], Section 2.2 of "Extensible Provisioning Protocol (EPP) Contact Mapping" [RFC5733], and Section 3.1 of "Domain Registry Grace Period Mapping for the Extensible Provisioning Protocol (EPP)" [RFC3915].
Each EPP status MUST map to a single RDAP status to ensure that data in the Domain Name Registries (DNRs) that use EPP can be accurately presented in RDAP.
Conventions Used in This Document
The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "
SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119
<RDAP Status>, where a blank <RDAP Status> indicates a gap in the mapping.
The "RDAP JSON Values" registry [rdap json values] does have a set of prohibited statuses including "renew prohibited", "update prohibited", "transfer prohibited", and "delete prohibited", but these statuses do not directly map to the EPP prohibited statuses.
EPP provides status codes that allow distinguishing the case that an action is prohibited because of server policy from the case that an action is prohibited because of a client request.
The ability to make this distinction needs to be preserved in RDAP.
Each of the EPP status values that don't map directly to an RDAP status value is described below.
Each EPP status value includes a proposed new RDAP status value and a description of the value.
The RDAP status value is derived from the EPP status value by converting the EPP "camelCase" representation to lowercase with a space character inserted between word boundaries.
This grace period is provided after the initial registration of the object.
If the object is deleted by the client during this period, the server provides a credit to the client for the cost of the registration.
This grace period is provided after an object registration period expires and is extended (renewed) automatically by the server.
If the object is deleted by the client during this period, the server provides a credit to the client for the cost of the auto renewal.
The client requested that requests to delete the object MUST be rejected.
clientHold   client hold;  The client requested that the DNS delegation information MUST NOT be published for the object.
clientRenewProhibited   client renew prohibited;  The client requested that requests to renew the object MUST be rejected.
clientTransferProhibited   client transfer prohibited;  The client requested that requests to transfer the object MUST be rejected.
clientUpdateProhibited   client update prohibited;  The client requested that requests to update the object (other than to remove this status) MUST be rejected.
pending restore;  An object is in the process of being restored after being in the redemption period state.
redemption period;  A delete has been received, but the object has not yet been purged because an opportunity exists to restore the object and abort the deletion process.
This grace period is provided after an object registration period is explicitly extended (renewed) by the client.
If the object is deleted by the client during this period, the server provides a credit to the client for the cost of the renewal.
serverDeleteProhibited   server delete prohibited;  The server set the status so that requests to delete the object MUST be rejected.
The server set the status so that requests to renew the object MUST be rejected.
The server set the status so that requests to transfer the object MUST be rejected.
serverUpdateProhibited   server update prohibited;  The server set the status so that requests to update the object (other than to remove this status) MUST be rejected.
The server set the status so that DNS delegation information MUST NOT be published for the object.
This grace period is provided after the successful transfer of object registration sponsorship from one client to another client.
If the object is deleted by the client during this period, the server provides a credit to the client for the cost of the transfer.
The resulting mapping after registering the new RDAP statuses is: addPeriod
clientRenewProhibited   client renew prohibited clientTransferProhibited   client transfer prohibited clientUpdateProhibited   client update prohibited inactive   inactive linked   associated
server delete prohibited serverRenewProhibited   server renew prohibited serverTransferProhibited   server transfer prohibited
serverUpdateProhibited   server update prohibited serverHold   server hold transferPeriod   transfer period 3.

The status values described in this document can be subject to server side information disclosure policies that restrict display of the values to authorized clients.
Implementers may wish to review [RFC7481] for a description of the RDAP security services that can be used to implement information disclosure policies.
