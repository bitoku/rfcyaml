  - "Abstract\n   The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) has been asked to take\
    \ a\n   position on the inclusion into IETF standards-track documents of\n   functionality\
    \ designed to facilitate wiretapping.\n   This memo explains what the IETF thinks\
    \ the question means, why its\n   answer is \"no\", and what that answer means.\n"
- title: 1. Summary position
  contents:
  - "1. Summary position\n   The IETF has decided not to consider requirements for\
    \ wiretapping as\n   part of the process for creating and maintaining IETF standards.\n\
    \   It takes this position for the following basic reasons:\n   - The IETF, an\
    \ international standards body, believes itself to be\n     the wrong forum for\
    \ designing protocol or equipment features that\n     address needs arising from\
    \ the laws of individual countries,\n     because these laws vary widely across\
    \ the areas that IETF standards\n     are deployed in.  Bodies whose scope of\
    \ authority correspond to a\n     single regime of jurisdiction are more appropriate\
    \ for this task.\n   - The IETF sets standards for communications that pass across\n\
    \     networks that may be owned, operated and maintained by people from\n   \
    \  numerous jurisdictions with numerous requirements for privacy.  In\n     light\
    \ of these potentially divergent requirements, the IETF\n     believes that the\
    \ operation of the Internet and the needs of its\n     users are best served by\
    \ making sure the security properties of\n     connections across the Internet\
    \ are as well known as possible.  At\n     the present stage of our ignorance\
    \ this means making them as free\n     from security loopholes as possible.\n\
    \   - The IETF believes that in the case of traffic that is today going\n    \
    \ across the Internet without being protected by the end systems (by\n     encryption\
    \ or other means), the use of existing network features,\n     if deployed intelligently,\
    \ provides extensive opportunities for\n     wiretapping, and should be sufficient\
    \ under presently seen\n     requirements for many cases. The IETF does not see\
    \ an engineering\n     solution that allows such wiretapping when the end systems\
    \ take\n     adequate measures to protect their communications.\n   - The IETF\
    \ believes that adding a requirement for wiretapping will\n     make affected\
    \ protocol designs considerably more complex.\n     Experience has shown that\
    \ complexity almost inevitably jeopardizes\n     the security of communications\
    \ even when it is not being tapped by\n     any legal means; there are also obvious\
    \ risks raised by having to\n     protect the access to the wiretap. This is in\
    \ conflict with the\n     goal of freedom from security loopholes.\n   - The IETF\
    \ restates its strongly held belief, stated at greater\n     length in [RFC 1984],\
    \ that both commercial development of the\n     Internet and adequate privacy\
    \ for its users against illegal\n     intrusion requires the wide availability\
    \ of strong cryptographic\n     technology.\n   - On the other hand, the IETF\
    \ believes that mechanisms designed to\n     facilitate or enable wiretapping,\
    \ or methods of using other\n     facilities for such purposes, should be openly\
    \ described, so as to\n     ensure the maximum review of the mechanisms and ensure\
    \ that they\n     adhere as closely as possible to their design constraints. The\
    \ IETF\n     believes that the publication of such mechanisms, and the\n     publication\
    \ of known weaknesses in such mechanisms, is a Good\n     Thing.\n"
- title: 2. The Raven process
  contents:
  - "2. The Raven process\n   The issue of the IETF doing work on legal intercept\
    \ technologies came\n   up as a byproduct of the extensive work that the IETF\
    \ is now doing in\n   the area if IP-based telephony.\n   In the telephony world,\
    \ there has been a tradition of cooperation\n   (often mandated by law) between\
    \ law enforcement agencies and\n   telephone equipment operators on wiretapping,\
    \ leading to companies\n   that build telephone equipment adding wiretapping features\
    \ to their\n   telephony-related equipment, and an emerging consensus in the\n\
    \   industry of how to build and manage such features. Some traditional\n   telephony\
    \ standards organizations have supported this by adding\n   intercept features\
    \ to their telephony-related standards.\n   Since the future of the telephone\
    \ seems to be intertwined with the\n   Internet it is inevitable that the primary\
    \ Internet standards\n   organization would be faced with the issue sooner or\
    \ later.\n   In this case, some of the participants of one of the IETF working\n\
    \   groups working on a new standard for communication between components\n  \
    \ of a distributed phone switch brought up the issue. Since adding\n   features\
    \ of this type would be something the IETF had never done\n   before, the IETF\
    \ management decided to have a public discussion\n   before deciding if the working\
    \ group should go ahead. A new mailing\n   list was created (the Raven mailing\
    \ list, see\n   http://www.ietf.org/mailman/listinfo/raven) for this discussion.\n\
    \   Close to 500 people subscribed to the list and about 10% of those\n   sent\
    \ at least one message to the list. The discussion on this list\n   was a precursor\
    \ to a discussion held during the IETF plenary in\n   Washington, D.C.\n   Twenty-nine\
    \ people spoke during the plenary session. Opinions ranged\n   from libertarian:\
    \ 'governments have no right to wiretap' - to\n   pragmatic: 'it will be done\
    \ somewhere, best have it done where the\n   technology was developed'. At the\
    \ end of the discussion there was a\n   show of hands to indicate opinions: should\
    \ the IETF add special\n   features, not do this or abstain. Very few people spoke\
    \ out strongly\n   in support for adding the intercept features, while many spoke\
    \ out\n   against it, but a sizable portion of the audience refused to state an\n\
    \   opinion (raised their hands when asked for \"abstain\" in the show of\n  \
    \ hands).\n   This is the background on the basis of which the Internet Engineering\n\
    \   Steering Group (IESG) and the Internet Architecture Board (IAB) was\n   asked\
    \ to formulate a policy.\n"
- title: 3. A definition of wiretapping
  contents:
  - "3. A definition of wiretapping\n   The various legal statutes defining wiretapping\
    \ do not give adequate\n   definitions to distinguish between wiretapping and\
    \ various other\n   activities at the technical level. For the purposes of this\
    \ memo, the\n   following definition of wiretapping is used:\n   Wiretapping is\
    \ what occurs when information passed across the\n   Internet from one party to\
    \ one or more other parties is delivered to\n   a third party:\n   1. Without\
    \ the sending party knowing about the third party\n   2. Without any of the recipient\
    \ parties knowing about the delivery to\n      the third party\n   3. When the\
    \ normal expectation of the sender is that the transmitted\n      information\
    \ will only be seen by the recipient parties or parties\n      obliged to keep\
    \ the information in confidence\n   4. When the third party acts deliberately\
    \ to target the transmission\n      of the first party, either because he is of\
    \ interest, or because\n      the second party's reception is of interest.\n \
    \  The term \"party\", as used here, can refer to one person, a group of\n   persons,\
    \ or equipment acting on behalf of persons; the term \"party\"\n   is used for\
    \ brevity.\n   Of course, many wiretaps will be bidirectional, monitoring traffic\n\
    \   sent by two or more parties to each other.\n   Thus, for instance, monitoring\
    \ public newsgroups is not wiretapping\n   (condition 3 violated), random monitoring\
    \ of a large population is\n   not wiretapping (condition 4 violated), a recipient\
    \ passing on\n   private email is not wiretapping (condition 2 violated).\n  \
    \ An Internet equivalent of call tracing by means of accounting logs\n   (sometimes\
    \ called \"pen registers\") that is a feature of the telephone\n   network is\
    \ also wiretapping by this definition, since the normal\n   expectation of the\
    \ sender is that the company doing the accounting\n   will keep this information\
    \ in confidence.\n   Wiretapping may logically be thought of as 3 distinct steps:\n\
    \   - Capture - getting information off the wire that contains the\n     information\
    \ wanted.\n   - Filtering - selecting the information wanted from information\n\
    \     gathered by accident.\n   - Delivery - transmitting the information wanted\
    \ to the ones who want\n     it.\n   The term applies to the whole process; for\
    \ instance, random\n   monitoring followed by filtering to extract information\
    \ about a\n   smaller group of parties would be wiretapping by this definition.\n\
    \   In all these stages, the possibility of using or abusing mechanisms\n   defined\
    \ for this purpose for other purposes exists.\n   This definition deliberately\
    \ does not include considerations of:\n   - Whether the wiretap is legal or not,\
    \ since that is a legal, not a\n     technical matter.\n   - Whether the wiretap\
    \ occurs in real time, or can be performed after\n     the fact by looking at\
    \ information recorded for other purposes\n     (such as the accounting example\
    \ given above).\n   - What the medium targeted by the wiretap is - whether it\
    \ is email,\n     IP telephony, Web browsing or EDI transfers.\n   These questions\
    \ are believed to be irrelevant to the policy outlined\n   in this memo.\n   Wiretapping\
    \ is also sometimes called \"interception\", but that term is\n   also used in\
    \ a sense that is considerably wider than the monitoring\n   of data crossing\
    \ networks, and is therefore not used here.\n"
- title: 4. Why the IETF does not take a moral position
  contents:
  - "4. Why the IETF does not take a moral position\n   Much of the debate about wiretapping\
    \ has centered around the question\n   of whether wiretapping is morally evil,\
    \ no matter who does it,\n   necessary in any civilized society, or an effective\
    \ tool for catching\n   criminals that has been abused in the past and will be\
    \ abused again.\n   The IETF has decided not to take a position in this matter,\
    \ since:\n   - There is no clear consensus around a single position in the IETF.\n\
    \   - There is no means of detecting the morality of an act \"on the\n     wire\"\
    .  Since the IETF deals with protocol standardization, not\n     protocol deployment,\
    \ it is not in a position to dictate that its\n     product is only used in moral\
    \ or legal ways.\n   However, a few observations can be made:\n   - Experience\
    \ shows that tools which are effective for a purpose tend\n     to be used for\
    \ that purpose.\n   - Experience shows that tools designed for one purpose that\
    \ are\n     effective for another tend to be used for that other purpose too,\n\
    \     no matter what its designers intended.\n   - Experience shows that if a\
    \ vulnerability exists in a security\n     system, it is likely that someone will\
    \ take advantage of it sooner\n     or later.\n   - Experience shows that human\
    \ factors, not technology per se, is the\n     biggest single source of such vulnerabilities.\n\
    \   What this boils down to is that if effective tools for wiretapping\n   exist,\
    \ it is likely that they will be used as designed, for purposes\n   legal in their\
    \ jurisdiction, and also in ways they were not intended\n   for, in ways that\
    \ are not legal in that jurisdiction. When weighing\n   the development or deployment\
    \ of such tools, this should be borne in\n   mind.\n"
- title: 5. Utility considerations
  contents:
  - "5. Utility considerations\n   When designing any communications function, it\
    \ is a relevant question\n   to ask if such functions efficiently perform the\
    \ task they are\n   designed for, or whether the work spent in developing them\
    \ is not, in\n   fact, worth the benefit gained.\n   Given that there are no specific\
    \ proposals being developed in the\n   IETF, the IETF cannot weigh proposals for\
    \ wiretapping directly in\n   this manner.\n   However, as above, a few general\
    \ observations can be made:\n   - Wiretapping by copying the bytes passed between\
    \ two users of the\n     Internet with known, static points of attachment is not\
    \ hard.\n     Standard functions designed for diagnostic purposes can accomplish\n\
    \     this.\n   - Correlating users' identities with their points of attachment\
    \ to\n     the Internet can be significantly harder, but not impossible, if\n\
    \     the user uses standard means of identification. However, this means\n  \
    \   linking into multiple Internet subsystems used for address\n     assignment,\
    \ name resolution and so on; this is not trivial.\n   - An adversary has several\
    \ simple countermeasures available to defeat\n     wiretapping attempts, even\
    \ without resorting to encryption. This\n     includes Internet cafes and anonymous\
    \ dialups, anonymous remailers,\n     multi-hop login sessions and use of obscure\
    \ communications media;\n     these are well known tools in the cracker community.\n\
    \   - Of course, communications where the content is protected by strong\n   \
    \  encryption can be easily recorded, but the content is still not\n     available\
    \ to the wiretapper, defeating all information gathering\n     apart from traffic\
    \ analysis.  Since Internet data is already in\n     digital form, encrypting\
    \ it is very simple for the end-user.\n   These things taken together mean that\
    \ while wiretapping is an\n   efficient tool for use in situations where the target\
    \ of a wiretap is\n   either ignorant or believes himself innocent of wrongdoing,\n\
    \   Internet-based wiretapping is a less useful tool than might be\n   imagined\
    \ against an alerted and technically competent adversary.\n"
- title: 6. Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "6. Security Considerations\n   Wiretapping, by definition (see above), releases\
    \ information that the\n   information sender did not expect to be released.\n\
    \   This means that a system that allows wiretapping has to contain a\n   function\
    \ that can be exercised without alerting the information\n   sender to the fact\
    \ that his desires for privacy are not being met.\n   This, in turn, means that\
    \ one has to design the system in such a way\n   that it cannot guarantee any\
    \ level of privacy; at the maximum, it can\n   only guarantee it as long as the\
    \ function for wiretapping is not\n   exercised.\n   For instance, encrypted telephone\
    \ conferences have to be designed in\n   such a way that the participants cannot\
    \ know to whom any shared\n   keying material is being revealed.\n   This means:\n\
    \   - The system is less secure than it could be had this function not\n     been\
    \ present.\n   - The system is more complex than it could be had this function\
    \ not\n     been present.\n   - Being more complex, the risk of unintended security\
    \ flaws in the\n     system is larger.\n   Wiretapping, even when it is not being\
    \ exercised, therefore lowers\n   the security of the system.\n"
