- title: Abstract
  contents:
  - "Abstract\n   This document defines the initial principles of operation for the\n\
    \   tpc.int subdomain, a collection of service listings accessible over\n   the\
    \ Internet infrastructure through an administered namespace\n   contained within\
    \ the Domain Name System [1,2].\n   This document is informational and applies\
    \ only to those Internet\n   sites that choose to register themselves within the\
    \ tpc.int\n   subdomain.  The tpc.int subdomain is organized as a cooperative\
    \ of\n   the sites that provide access within the context of the subdomain.\n\
    \   Policy for the subdomain is set by a board responsible to the\n   cooperative.\n\
    \   The primary purpose of the tpc.int subdomain is to provide\n   transparent\
    \ mapping between general-purpose computers on the Internet\n   and special-purpose\
    \ devices directly connected to the telephone\n   network.  Initially, a remote\
    \ printing service is defined [3,4] which\n   ties together G3-compatible facsimile\
    \ devices on the telephone\n   network with users of electronic mail in the Internet\
    \ and associated\n   message-handling domains connected to the Internet by application-\n\
    \   layer gateways.\n   It should be noted that remote printer gateways have long\
    \ been\n   technically feasible and have become an integral part of many\n   individual\
    \ networks.  The tpc.int subdomain integrates individual\n   sites into a common\
    \ namespace, transforming remote printing from a\n   single-site, value-added\
    \ service into an integral transparent service\n   in the global Internet.\n"

  - "Overview of Services in the TPC.INT Subdomain\n   The tpc.int subdomain is organized\
    \ as a cooperative, an association\n   organized for the purpose, without gain\
    \ to itself, of rendering\n   service as defined in this document and as further\
    \ defined by the\n   membership of the cooperative.  Members of the tpc.int subdomain\n\
    \   cooperative are defined as those Internet sites who provide access to\n  \
    \ services as defined in this document and as periodically amended by\n   the\
    \ membership as represented by the Board of Arbitration and\n   Conciliation for\
    \ the tpc.int subdomain.\n   The primary purpose of the tpc.int subdomain is to\
    \ provide\n   transparent mappings between users of general-purpose computers\
    \ on\n   the Internet and special-purpose devices directly connected to the\n\
    \   telephone network.  This mapping extends the population reachable\n   from\
    \ the Internet by providing a communications path to devices not\n   otherwise\
    \ directly addressable.\n   The initial remote printing facility is built on top\
    \ of the\n   electronic mail protocols of the Internet, including RFC 822 [5]\
    \ and\n   MIME [6].  Because the remote printing service uses the message-\n \
    \  handling facilities of the Internet, this service is also available\n   to\
    \ message-handling domains that are connected to the Internet\n   through application-layer\
    \ gateways (e.g., X.400-compatible systems\n   [7], UUCP-based message-handling\
    \ environments [8], and commercial\n   services such as AT&T Mail), MCI Mail),\
    \ SprintMail), and CompuServe)\n   [9]).\n"
- title: Operation of Name Service in the TPC.INT Subdomain
  contents:
  - "Operation of Name Service in the TPC.INT Subdomain\n   Services in the Internet\
    \ are identified with a service target name as\n   listed in the Domain Name System\
    \ (DNS).  These target names are\n   looked up in the DNS and the appropriate\
    \ resource records associated\n   with the name are returned.  After the name\
    \ lookup has been\n   completed, the initiator exchanges a series of IP packets\
    \ with an\n   Internet site which provides access to a service accessible through\n\
    \   the tpc.int subdomain.\n   In the case of remote printing, the DNS MX resource\
    \ record is used to\n   register those Internet sites that provide access to the\
    \ remote\n   printing facility.  Specifically, an Internet site running a remote\n\
    \   printer server registers itself in the DNS as being willing to\n   provide\
    \ access to some portion of the telephone system numbering plan\n   as registered\
    \ by one or more MX records within the tpc.int subdomain.\n   For example, if\
    \ the host hewes.radio.com is willing to provide remote\n   printing to devices\
    \ with telephone numbers beginning with the prefix\n   +1-415-336, the host would\
    \ be listed in the Domain Name System with\n   the following MX resource record:\n\
    \      *.6.3.3.5.1.4.1.tpc.int.    IN MX    10 hewes.radio.com.\n   Note that\
    \ the resource records can have an arbitrary level of\n   precision. For example,\
    \ the North American numbering plan (IDDD\n   country code 1) is structured by\
    \ a 3-digit area code, followed by a\n   3-digit exchange prefix, followed by\
    \ a 4-digit station number.  As\n   such, one might expect that resource records\
    \ in this zone would be\n   similar to\n      *.5.1.4.1.tpc.int.         IN MX\
    \    10  hewes.radio.com.\n   which accesses any printer with a telephone number\
    \ prefix of +1-415\n   (i.e., any printer in area code 415).  Another record might\
    \ be\n   similar to\n      *.8.6.9.5.1.4.1.tpc.int.   IN MX    10  hewes.radio.com.\n\
    \   allowing access to any printer in area code 415, exchange prefix 968.\n  \
    \ However, the level of precision is arbitrary. For example, if all of\n   the\
    \ printers in an organization had a telephone number prefix of +1-\n   415-96,\
    \ the following resource record could be used:\n      *.6.9.5.1.4.1.tpc.int. \
    \    IN MX    10  hewes.radio.com.\n   It is the responsibility of administrators\
    \ of the tpc.int namespace\n   to register only those Internet sites that are\
    \ willing to confirm to\n   the principles of  operation as defined in this document\
    \ and as\n   periodically amended by the Board of Arbitration and Conciliation\
    \ for\n   the tpc.int subdomain.\n   It is a key principle in the tpc.int subdomain\
    \ that all Internet\n   sites meeting the principles of operation as stated in\
    \ this document\n   shall be registered in the tpc.int subdomain without bias\
    \ and that\n   the subdomain should encourage the largest number of Internet sites\n\
    \   possible.\n   If multiple Internet sites are willing to provide access in\
    \ the same\n   area, multiple resource records for the same target name are\n\
    \   maintained.  In response to a query, the Domain Name System returns\n   the\
    \ resource records in an unordered list. In practice, however, the\n   initiator\
    \ will consult the list in the order returned. To provide an\n   unbiased environment,\
    \ an authoritative name server for the tpc.int\n   subdomain shall alternate the\
    \ ordering of the list frequently, and\n   shall return a small TTL with the resource\
    \ records.\n"
- title: Policy Determination in the TPC.INT Subdomain
  contents:
  - "Policy Determination in the TPC.INT Subdomain\n   The tpc.int subdomain is organized\
    \ as a cooperative, an association\n   organized for the purpose of rendering\
    \ service, without gain to\n   itself, within the scope of service defined in\
    \ this document and as\n   further defined by the membership of the cooperative.\
    \  Members of the\n   tpc.int subdomain cooperative are defined as those Internet\
    \ sites who\n   provide access to services as defined in this document and as\n\
    \   periodically amended by the membership as represented by the Board of\n  \
    \ Arbitration and Conciliation for the TPC.INT Subdomain.\n   The primary purpose\
    \ of the tpc.int subdomain is to provide\n   transparent mappings between users\
    \ of general-purpose computers on\n   the Internet and special-purpose devices\
    \ directly connected to the\n   telephone network.  The listing of services in\
    \ the tpc.int subdomain\n   is for the necessity and convenience of the general\
    \ public with\n   special emphasis on providing a general-purpose link between\
    \ the\n   Internet infrastructure and communications devices connected to the\n\
    \   telephone network.\n   Policies for the tpc.int subdomain are determined by\
    \ its Board of\n   Arbitration and Conciliation.  A Board of Arbitration and\n\
    \   Conciliation has its roots in English law, which permitted members of\n  \
    \ a trade to appoint masters and workmen among them to serve as\n   councils of\
    \ arbitration and conciliation for matters incapable of\n   being otherwise settled\
    \ [10].  The Board of Arbitration and\n   Conciliation in the tpc.int subdomain\
    \ consists of members of the\n   tpc.int subdomain cooperative appointed to hear\
    \ and determine all\n   questions between members which may be submitted to them\
    \ arising out\n   of the operation of services listed in the subdomain.\n   The\
    \ initial Board of Arbitration and Conciliation is defined in this\n   document.\
    \  Members of the Board shall serve for two-year terms except\n   that 50 percent\
    \ or more of the initial Board shall serve for a one-\n   year term.  The Board\
    \ shall determine and publish procedures which\n   allow members of the tpc.int\
    \ subdomain cooperative to select new\n   members of the Board as their terms\
    \ expire.\n   If an issue relating to the definition of service or operation of\n\
    \   service listed within in the subdomain is raised and is incapable of\n   being\
    \ settled otherwise, the matter shall be submitted by a member to\n   the Board\
    \ of Arbitration and Conciliation.  The Board shall hear the\n   question, making\
    \ provisions for comments by other members of the\n   tpc.int subdomain cooperative\
    \ and by the general public and shall\n   make and publish a determination of\
    \ policy.\n   Secretariat services for the tpc.int subdomain are initially provided\n\
    \   by the Internet Multicasting Service, a non-profit corporation\n   located\
    \ in Washington, D.C.  The tpc.int subdomain cooperative may\n   contract with\
    \ other groups for the provision of secretariat services\n   at any time.\n  \
    \ The tpc.int subdomain is organized as a cooperative to encourage\n   policy\
    \ determination to be in the hands of those that are offering\n   the services.\
    \  The subdomain encourages the establishment of a large\n   number of sites,\
    \ combining the distributed local efforts of many\n   individuals and small groups\
    \ into a global service.\n"

    \ to provide similar\n   mappings. The Internet sites participating in those other\
    \ subdomains\n   might also be registered under the tpc.int subdomain, or could\
    \ choose\n   to be registered solely within those other subdomains with different\n\
    \   policies.\n   It is the policy of the tpc.int subdomain cooperative to encourage\n\
    \   the establishment of other service listing domains, either as a\n   public\
    \ trust or cooperative or as a purely commercial venture.\n"
