- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   At the time of this writing there are quite a number of\
    \ proposed\n   solutions to the problem of multihoming within IPv6, and related\n\
    \   problems such as the locator/identifier split.\n   This document contains\
    \ several sets of questions that attempt to\n   focus these solutions on operational\
    \ problems.  This document does\n   not suggest methods to solve the problem.\
    \  Rather, we simply want to\n   ensure that while solving a problem the medicine\
    \ is not worse than\n   the cure.  We focus on practical operational problems\
    \ that both\n   single-homed and multihomed deployments may face.\n   It is the\
    \ hope of the author that perhaps the authors of other\n   proposed solutions\
    \ will use this document to identify gaps in their\n   solutions, and cooperate\
    \ to close those gaps.\n"
- title: 1.1.  Reading this Document
  contents:
  - "1.1.  Reading this Document\n   The questions are organized along the following\
    \ lines:\n   o  changes to on the wire behavior;\n   o  routing system interactions;\n\
    \   o  identifier/mapping split;\n   o  application concerns and backward compatibility;\n\
    \   o  name service interactions;\n   o  legal concerns; and\n   o  security considerations.\n\
    \   In reality many questions cut across all of these concerns.  For\n   instance,\
    \ the identifier / locator split has substantial application\n   implications,\
    \ and every area has security considerations.\n   Unless it is blatantly obvious,\
    \ each question contains some reasoning\n   as to why it is being asked.  It is\
    \ envisioned that no solution will\n   answer every question with completeness,\
    \ but that there will be\n   tradeoffs to be made.  The answers by the various\
    \ designers of\n   solutions will hopefully shed some light on which tradeoffs\
    \ we as a\n   community wish to make.\n   It would seem silly for people who have\
    \ written detailed answers to\n   these questions to have to repeat the exercise.\
    \  Therefore, a simple\n   reference to existing documents will suffice, so long\
    \ as the answer\n   is complete.  If it is not complete, then feel free to reference\
    \ it\n   and add what text is necessary to make the answer complete.\n   This\
    \ document presumes a familiarity with RFC 3582 [2], and does not\n   attempt\
    \ to repeat the requirements work gathered there.\n"

- title: 2.3.  Why is the layer you chose the correct one?
  contents:
  - "2.3.  Why is the layer you chose the correct one?\n   Each layer has its benefits\
    \ and tradeoffs.  For instance, transport\n   layer solutions would require that\
    \ EVERY transport be modified, while\n   IP layer solutions may entail expansion\
    \ of the packet or a change to\n   the pseudo-header (thus requiring changes to\
    \ the transport layer).\n"

  contents:
  - "2.6.  Will your solution add additional latency?\n   Latency is an important\
    \ factor in many applications, including voice.\n   Any substantial amount of\
    \ additional latency, including session\n   initiation would be highly undesirable.\n"

  contents:
  - "2.7.  Can multihoming capabilities be negotiated end-to-end during a\n      connection?\n\
    \   If the proposal introduces additional overhead, can the information\n   be\
    \ somehow piggybacked on messages that are already used?  This would\n   be useful\
    \ in order to keep connection setup constant.  Please also\n   indicate any drawbacks\
    \ that might apply due to this piggybacking.\n"

  contents:
  - "2.8.  Do you change the way fragmenting is handled?\n   If you use a shim approach,\
    \ do you fragment above or below the shim?\n   How are fragments identified, so\
    \ that they can be reassembled?  If\n   you use any additional names, do they\
    \ need to be associated with\n   fragments?  If not, why not?  If so, how will\
    \ that happen?\n"
- title: 2.9.  Are there any layer 2 implications to your proposal?
  contents:
  - "2.9.  Are there any layer 2 implications to your proposal?\n   While IPv6 has\

    \   solution?  For instance, are there implication for ingress filters?\n   If\
    \ so, what are they?\n   When considering this question, there are really two\
    \ issues.  First,\n   will middleboxes impede your solution by rewriting headers\
    \ in some\n   way, as NATs do for IP addresses, and web caches do at higher layers?\n\
    \   Second, is there a way in which middleboxes are actually part of your\n  \
