Attached are the Host traffic statistics for the month of September 1973.
It is my intention to issue Traffic Statistics for October, November, and December in RFC form, and then to remove these reports from the RFC series.
I will continue to produce the reports, and so could have the NIC distribute them to technical Liaisons if there is any interest.
Alternatively, I could continue issuing them as RFC's if there is great interest.
RECEIVED AT NIC OCTOBER 19, 1973.
