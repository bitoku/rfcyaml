  - "1.  Introduction\n   TLS 1.2 [RFC5246] and earlier versions of TLS support renegotiation,\n
    \  a mechanism for changing parameters and keys partway through a\n   connection.
    \ This was sometimes used to implement reactive client\n   authentication in HTTP/1.1
    [RFC7230], where the server decides\n   whether or not to request a client certificate
    based on the HTTP\n   request.\n   HTTP/2 [RFC7540] multiplexes multiple HTTP
    requests over a single\n   connection, which is incompatible with the mechanism
    above.  Clients\n   cannot correlate the certificate request with the HTTP request
    that\n   triggered it.  Thus, Section 9.2.1 of [RFC7540] forbids\n   renegotiation.\n
    \  TLS 1.3 [RFC8446] removes renegotiation and replaces it with separate\n   post-handshake
    authentication and key update mechanisms.  Post-\n   handshake authentication
    has the same problems with multiplexed\n   protocols as TLS 1.2 renegotiation,
    but the prohibition in [RFC7540]\n   only applies to renegotiation.\n   This document
    updates HTTP/2 [RFC7540] to similarly forbid TLS 1.3\n   post-handshake authentication.\n"

  - "2.  Requirements Language\n   The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\",
    \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"NOT
    RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and\n   \"OPTIONAL\" in this document are to be interpreted
    as described in\n   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear
    in all\n   capitals, as shown here.\n"
  title: 2.  Requirements Language
- contents:
  - "3.  Post-Handshake Authentication in HTTP/2\n   HTTP/2 servers MUST NOT send
    post-handshake TLS 1.3\n   CertificateRequest messages.  HTTP/2 clients MUST treat
    such messages\n   as connection errors (see Section 5.4.1 of [RFC7540]) of type\n
    \  PROTOCOL_ERROR.\n   [RFC7540] permitted renegotiation before the HTTP/2 connection\n
    \  preface to provide confidentiality of the client certificate.  TLS\n   1.3
    encrypts the client certificate in the initial handshake, so this\n   is no longer
    necessary.  HTTP/2 servers MUST NOT send post-handshake\n   TLS 1.3 CertificateRequest
    messages before the connection preface.\n   The above applies even if the client
    offered the\n   \"post_handshake_auth\" TLS extension.  This extension is advertised\n
    \  independently of the selected Application-Layer Protocol Negotiation\n   (ALPN)
    protocol [RFC7301], so it is not sufficient to resolve the\n   conflict with HTTP/2.
    \ HTTP/2 clients that also offer other ALPN\n   protocols, notably HTTP/1.1, in
    a TLS ClientHello MAY include the\n   \"post_handshake_auth\" extension to support
    those other protocols.\n   This does not indicate support in HTTP/2.\n"
  title: 3.  Post-Handshake Authentication in HTTP/2
- contents:
  - "4.  Other Post-Handshake TLS Messages in HTTP/2\n   [RFC8446] defines two other
    messages that are exchanged after the\n   handshake is complete: KeyUpdate and
    NewSessionTicket.\n   KeyUpdate messages only affect TLS itself and do not require
    any\n   interaction with the application protocol.  HTTP/2 implementations\n   MUST
    support key updates when TLS 1.3 is negotiated.\n   NewSessionTicket messages
    are also permitted.  Though these interact\n   with HTTP when early data is enabled,
    these interactions are defined\n   in [RFC8470] and are allowed for in the design
    of HTTP/2.\n   Unless the use of a new type of TLS message depends on an interaction\n
    \  with the application-layer protocol, that TLS message can be sent\n   after
    the handshake completes.\n"

- contents:
  - "5.  Security Considerations\n   This document resolves a compatibility concern
    between HTTP/2 and TLS\n   1.3 when supporting post-handshake authentication with
    HTTP/1.1.\n   This lowers the barrier for deploying TLS 1.3, a major security\n
    \  improvement over TLS 1.2.\n"
