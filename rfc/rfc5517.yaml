- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   In an Ethernet switch, a VLAN is a broadcast domain in which\
    \ hosts\n   can establish direct communication with one another at Layer 2.  If\n\
    \   untrusted devices are introduced into a VLAN, security issues may\n   arise\
    \ because trusted and untrusted devices end up sharing the same\n   broadcast\
    \ domain.\n   The traditional solution to this kind of problem is to assign a\n\
    \   separate VLAN to each user concerned about Layer 2 security issues.\n   However,\
    \ the IEEE 802.1Q standard [802.1Q] specifies that the VLAN ID\n   field in an\
    \ Ethernet frame is 12 bits wide.  That allows for a\n   theoretical maximum of\
    \ 4094 VLANs in an Ethernet network (VLAN\n   numbers 0 and 4095 are reserved).\
    \  If the network administrator\n   assigns one VLAN per user, then that equates\
    \ to a maximum of 4094\n   users that can be supported.  The private VLANs technology\
    \ described\n   in this memo addresses this scalability problem by offering more\n\
    \   granular and more flexible Layer 2 segregation, as explained in the\n   following\
    \ sections.\n"
- title: 1.1.  Security Concerns with Sharing a VLAN
  contents:
  - "1.1.  Security Concerns with Sharing a VLAN\n   Companies who have Internet presence\
    \ can either host their servers in\n   their own premises or, alternatively, they\
    \ can locate their servers\n   at the Internet Service Provider's premises.  A\
    \ typical ISP would\n   have a server farm that offers web-hosting functionality\
    \ for a number\n   of customers.  Co-locating the servers in a server farm offers\
    \ ease\n   of management but, at the same time, may raise security concerns.\n\
    \   Let us assume that the ISP puts all the servers in one big VLAN.\n   Servers\
    \ residing in the same VLAN can listen to Layer 2 broadcasts\n   from other servers.\
    \  Once a server learns the Media Access Control\n   (MAC) address associated\
    \ to the IP address of another computer in the\n   same VLAN, it can establish\
    \ direct Layer 2 communication with that\n   device without having to go through\
    \ a Layer 3 gateway/firewall.  If,\n   for example, an attacker gets access to\
    \ one of the servers, he or she\n   can use that compromised host to launch an\
    \ attack on other servers in\n   the server farm.  To protect themselves from\
    \ malicious attacks, ISP\n   customers want their machines to be isolated from\
    \ other machines in\n   the same server farm.\n   The security concerns become\
    \ even more apparent in metropolitan area\n   networks.  Metropolitan Service\
    \ Providers may want to provide Layer 2\n   Ethernet access to homes, rental communities,\
    \ businesses, etc.  In\n   this scenario, the subscriber next door could very\
    \ well be a\n   malicious network user.\n   It is therefore very important to\
    \ offer Layer 2 traffic isolation\n   among customers.  Customer A would not want\
    \ his Layer 2 frames being\n   broadcast to customer B, who happens to be in the\
    \ same VLAN.  Also,\n   customer A would not want customer B to bypass a router\
    \ or a firewall\n   and establish direct Layer 2 communication with him/her.\n"
- title: 1.2.  The Traditional Solution and Its Related Problems
  contents:
  - "1.2.  The Traditional Solution and Its Related Problems\n   The traditional solution\
    \ would be to assign a separate VLAN to each\n   customer.  That way, each user\
    \ would be assured of Layer 2 isolation\n   from devices belonging to other users.\n\
    \   However, with the VLAN-per-customer model, if an ISP wanted to offer\n   web-hosting\
    \ services to, say, 4000 customers, it would consume 4000\n   VLANs.  Theoretically,\
    \ the maximum number of VLANs that an 802.1Q-\n   compliant networking device\
    \ can support is 4094.  In reality, many\n   devices support a much smaller number\
    \ of active VLANs.  Even if all\n   devices supported all 4094 VLANs, there would\
    \ still be a scalability\n   problem when the 4095th customer signed up.\n   A\
    \ second problem with assigning a separate VLAN per customer is\n   management\
    \ of IP addresses.  Since each VLAN requires a separate\n   subnet, there can\
    \ be potential wastage of IP addresses in each\n   subnet.  This issue has been\
    \ described by RFC 3069 [RFC3069] and will\n   not be discussed in detail in this\
    \ document.\n"
- title: 2.  Private VLANs Architecture
  contents:
  - "2.  Private VLANs Architecture\n   The private VLANs architecture is similar\
    \ to but more elaborate than\n   the aggregated VLAN model proposed in RFC 3069.\
    \  The concepts of\n   'super VLAN' and 'sub VLAN' used in that RFC are functionally\
    \ similar\n   to the concepts of 'primary VLAN' and 'secondary VLAN' used in this\n\
    \   document.\n   On the other hand, the private VLANs technology differs from\
    \ the\n   mechanism described in [RFC4562] because instead of using a MAC-\n \
    \  address-based 'forced forwarding' scheme it uses a VLAN-based one.\n   A regular\
    \ VLAN is a single broadcast domain.  The private VLANs\n   technology partitions\
    \ a larger VLAN broadcast domain into smaller\n   sub-domains.  So far, two kinds\
    \ of special sub-domains specific to\n   the private VLANs technology have been\
    \ defined: an 'isolated' sub-\n   domain and a 'community' sub-domain.  Each sub-domain\
    \ is defined by\n   assigning a proper designation to a group of switch ports.\n\
    \   Within a private VLAN domain, three separate port designations exist.\n  \
    \ Each port designation has its own unique set of rules, which regulate\n   a\
    \ connected endpoint's ability to communicate with other connected\n   endpoints\
    \ within the same private VLAN domain.  The three port\n   designations are promiscuous,\
    \ isolated, and community.\n   An endpoint connected to a promiscuous port has\
    \ the ability to\n   communicate with any endpoint within the private VLAN.  Multiple\n\
    \   promiscuous ports may be defined within a single private VLAN domain.\n  \
    \ In most networks, Layer 3 default gateways or network management\n   stations\
    \ are commonly connected to promiscuous ports.\n   Isolated ports are typically\
    \ used for those endpoints that only\n   require access to a limited number of\
    \ outgoing interfaces on a\n   private-VLAN-enabled device.  An endpoint connected\
    \ to an isolated\n   port will only possess the ability to communicate with those\n\
    \   endpoints connected to promiscuous ports.  Endpoints connected to\n   adjacent\
    \ isolated ports cannot communicate with one another.  For\n   example, within\
    \ a web-hosting environment, isolated ports can be used\n   to connect hosts that\
    \ require access only to default gateways.\n   A community port is a port that\
    \ is part of a private VLAN community,\n   which is a grouping of ports connected\
    \ to devices belonging to the\n   same entity (for example, a group of hosts of\
    \ the same ISP customer\n   or a pool of servers in a data center).  Within a\
    \ community,\n   endpoints can communicate with one another and can also communicate\n\
    \   with any configured promiscuous port.  Endpoints belonging to one\n   community\
    \ cannot instead communicate with endpoints belonging to a\n   different community\
    \ or with endpoints connected to isolated ports.\n   The aforementioned three\
    \ port designations directly correspond to\n   three different VLAN types (primary,\
    \ isolated, and community) with\n   well-defined, port-related characteristics,\
    \ which are described in\n   detail in Section 2.1 below.\n   Figure 1 below illustrates\
    \ the private VLAN model from a switch port\n   classification perspective.\n\

    \ of switch ports\n   With reference to Figure 1, each of the port types is described\n\
    \   below.\n   Isolated ports: An isolated port, e.g., i1 or i2, cannot talk to\
    \ any\n      other port in the private VLAN domain except for promiscuous ports\n\
    \      (e.g., p1).  If a customer device needs to have access only to a\n    \
    \  gateway router, then it should be attached to an isolated port.\n   Community\
    \ ports: A community port, e.g., c1 or c2, is part of a group\n      of ports.\
    \  The ports within a community can have Layer 2\n      communications with one\
    \ another and can also talk to any\n      promiscuous port.  If an ISP customer\
    \ has, say, 2 devices that\n      he/she wants to be isolated from other customers'\
    \ devices but to\n      be able to communicate among themselves, then community\
    \ ports\n      should be used.\n   Promiscuous ports: As the name suggests, a\
    \ promiscuous port (p1) can\n      talk to all other types of ports.  A promiscuous\
    \ port can talk to\n      isolated ports as well as community ports and vice versa.\
    \  Layer 3\n      gateways, DHCP servers, and other 'trusted' devices that need\
    \ to\n      communicate with the customer endpoints are typically connected\n\
    \      via promiscuous ports.\n   Please note that isolated, community, and promiscuous\
    \ ports can\n   either be access ports or hybrid/trunk ports (according to the\n\

- title: 2.1.  VLAN Pairings and Their Port-Related Characteristics
  contents:
  - "2.1.  VLAN Pairings and Their Port-Related Characteristics\n   In practice, the\
    \ Layer 2 communication constraints described in the\n   table above can be enforced\
    \ by creating sub-domains within the same\n   VLAN domain.  However, a sub-domain\
    \ within a VLAN domain cannot be\n   easily implemented with only one VLAN ID.\
    \  Instead, a mechanism of\n   pairing VLAN IDs can be used to achieve this notion.\
    \  Specifically,\n   sub-domains can be represented by pairs of VLAN numbers:\n\
    \     <Vp,Vs>   Vp is the primary VLAN ID               ------\n             \
    \  Vs is the secondary VLAN ID             | Vp |\n                          \
    \                             ------\n               where Vs can be:        \
    \               /      \\\n                  - Vi (an isolated VLAN)         \
    \   /        \\\n                  - Vc (a community VLAN)           /       \
    \   \\\n                                                 ------       ------\n\
    \                                                 | Vi |       | Vc |\n      \
    \                                           ------       ------\n            \
    \                                     <Vp,Vi>      <Vp,Vc>\n                 \
    \ Figure 2. A private VLAN domain can be\n                implemented with one\
    \ or more VLAN ID pairs.\n   A private VLAN domain is built with at least one\
    \ pair of VLAN IDs:\n   one (and only one) primary VLAN ID (Vp) plus one or more\
    \ secondary\n   VLAN IDs (Vs).  Secondary VLANs can be of two types: isolated\
    \ VLANs\n   (Vi) or community VLANs (Vc).\n   A primary VLAN is the unique and\
    \ common VLAN identifier of the whole\n   private VLAN domain and of all its VLAN\
    \ ID pairs.\n   An isolated VLAN is a secondary VLAN whose distinctive characteristic\n\
    \   is that all hosts connected to its ports are isolated at Layer 2.\n   Therefore,\
    \ its primary quality is that it allows a design based on\n   private VLANs to\
    \ use a total of only two VLAN identifiers (i.e., a\n   single private VLAN pairing)\
    \ to provide port isolation and serve any\n   number of end users (vs. a traditional\
    \ design in which one separate\n   plain VLAN ID would be assigned to each port).\n\
    \   A community VLAN is a secondary VLAN that is associated to a group of\n  \
    \ ports that connect to a certain \"community\" of end devices with\n   mutual\
    \ trust relationships.\n   While only one isolated VLAN is allowed in a private\
    \ VLAN domain,\n   there can be multiple distinct community VLANs.\n   Please\
    \ note that this VLAN pairing scheme simply requires that all\n   traffic transported\
    \ within primary and secondary VLANs be tagged\n   according to the IEEE 802.1Q\
    \ standard (see for example [802.1Q],\n   Section B.1.3), with at most a single\
    \ standard VLAN tag.  No special\n   double-tagging is necessary due to the 1:1\
    \ correspondence between a\n   secondary VLAN and its associated primary VLAN.\n\
    \   (Also note that this document makes use of the \"traditional\" VLAN\n   terminology,\
    \ whereas the IEEE 802.1ag standard [802.1ag] amends key\n   sections of IEEE\
    \ 802.1Q-2005 to make the distinction between \"VLANs\"\n   and \"VLAN IDs\" so\
    \ that every \"VLAN\" can be assigned one or more VLAN\n   IDs, similarly to the\
    \ pairing scheme described in this document.)\n   The ports in a private VLAN\
    \ domain derive their special\n   characteristics (as described in Section 2)\
    \ from the VLAN pairing(s)\n   they are configured with.  In particular, a promiscuous\
    \ port is a\n   port that can communicate with all other private VLAN port types\
    \ via\n   the primary VLAN and any associated secondary VLANs, whereas isolated\n\
    \   or community ports can communicate over their respective secondary\n   VLANs\
    \ only.\n   For example, with reference to Figure 1, a router R connected to the\n\
    \   promiscuous port can have Layer 2 communication with a device A\n   connected\
    \ to an isolated port and also with a device C connected to a\n   community port.\
    \  Devices C and D can also have Layer 2 communication\n   between themselves\
    \ since they are part of the same community VLAN.\n   However, devices A and B\
    \ cannot communicate at Layer 2 due to the\n   special port segregation property\
    \ of the isolated VLAN.  Also,\n   devices A and C cannot communicate at Layer\
    \ 2 since they belong to\n   different secondary VLANs.\n   The impact of these\
    \ enforced forwarding restrictions is two-fold.\n   Firstly, service providers\
    \ can assign multiple customers to the same\n   isolated VLAN, thereby conserving\
    \ VLAN IDs.  Secondly, end users can\n   be assured that their Layer 2 traffic\
    \ cannot be sniffed by other end\n   users sharing the same isolated VLAN or connected\
    \ to a different\n   secondary VLAN.\n"

    \ multiple switches, there is no standard mechanism\n   to propagate port-level\
    \ isolation information to other switches and,\n   consequently, the isolation\
    \ behavior fails in other switches.\n   In this document, the proposal is to implement\
    \ the port isolation\n   information implicitly at the VLAN level.  A particular\
    \ VLAN ID can\n   be configured to be the isolated VLAN.  All switches in the\
    \ network\n   would give special \"isolated VLAN\" treatment to frames tagged\
    \ with\n   this particular VLAN ID.  Thereby, the isolated VLAN behavior can be\n\
    \   maintained consistently across all switches in a Layer 2 network.\n   In general,\
    \ isolated, community, and primary VLANs can all span\n   multiple switches, just\
    \ like regular VLANs.  Inter-switch link ports\n   need not be aware of the special\
    \ VLAN type and will carry frames\n   tagged with these VLANs just like they do\
    \ any other frames.\n   One of the objectives of the private VLANs architecture\
    \ is to ensure\n   that traffic from an isolated port in one switch does not reach\n\
    \   another isolated or community port in a different switch even after\n   traversing\
    \ an inter-switch link.  By implicitly embedding the\n   isolation information\
    \ at the VLAN level and by transporting it along\n   with the packet, it is possible\
    \ to maintain a consistent behavior\n   throughout the network.  Therefore, the\
    \ mechanism discussed in\n   Section 2, which will restrict Layer 2 communication\
    \ between two\n   isolated ports in the same switch, will also restrict Layer\
    \ 2\n   communication between two isolated ports in two different switches.\n"

  - "4. A More Flexible IP Addressing Scheme\n   The common practice of deploying\
    \ multiple VLANs in a network for\n   security reasons and of allocating a subnet\
    \ to each VLAN has led to a\n   certain number of inefficiencies in network designs,\
    \ such as the\n   suboptimal utilization of the IP addressing space (as exemplified\
    \ in\n   the introduction of RFC 3069 [RFC3069]).  Moreover, each subnet\n   requires\
    \ addresses to be set aside for internetworking purposes (a\n   subnetwork address,\
    \ a directed broadcast address, default gateway\n   address(es), etc.).  So a\
    \ high number of used VLANs traditionally\n   translates into a significant number\
    \ of special addresses to be\n   consumed.\n   On the other hand, in a private\
    \ VLAN domain, all members can share a\n   common address space that is part of\
    \ a single subnet associated to\n   the primary VLAN.  An end device can be assigned\
    \ an IP address\n   statically or by using a DHCP server connected to a promiscuous\
    \ port.\n   Since IP addresses are no longer allocated on a smaller subnet basis\n\
    \   but are assigned from a larger address pool shared by all members in\n   the\
    \ private VLAN domain, address allocation becomes much more\n   efficient: fewer\
    \ addresses are consumed for internetworking purposes,\n   while most of the address\
    \ space is allotted to end devices, leaving\n   ample flexibility in the way available\
    \ addresses are (re-)assigned.\n"

  - "5.  Routing Considerations\n   The entire private VLANs architecture confines\
    \ secondary VLANs within\n   the 2nd layer of the OSI model.  With reference to\
    \ Figure 2, the\n   secondary VLANs are internal to a private VLAN domain.  Layer\
    \ 3\n   entities are not directly aware of their existence: to them it\n   appears\
    \ as if all the end devices are part of the primary VLAN.\n   With reference to\
    \ Figure 1, the isolation behavior between devices A\n   and B is at the Layer\
    \ 2 level only.  Devices A and B can still\n   communicate at the Layer 3 level\
    \ via the router R.  Since A and B are\n   part of the same subnet, the router\
    \ assumes that they should be able\n   to talk directly to each other.  That however\
    \ is prevented by the\n   isolated VLAN's specific behavior.  So, in order to\
    \ enable A and B to\n   communicate via the router, a proxy-ARP-like functionality\
    \ needs to\n   be supported on the router interface.\n   With regard to the specific\
    \ version of the IP protocol in use, all\n   routing considerations apply to both\
    \ IPv4 and IPv6 for the case of\n   unicast traffic.  On the other hand, due to\
    \ their complexity,\n   considerations about multicast bridging and routing within\
    \ a private\n   VLAN domain transcend the scope of this introductory document,\
    \ and\n   are therefore omitted.\n"

  - "6.  Security Considerations\n   In a heterogeneous Layer 2 network that is built\
    \ with switches from\n   multiple vendors, the private VLAN feature should be\
    \ supported and\n   configured on all the switches.  If a switch S in that network\
    \ does\n   not support this feature, then there may be undesired forwarding of\n\
    \   packets, including permanent flooding of Layer 2 unicast frames.\n   That\
    \ is because switch S is not aware of the association between\n   primary and\
    \ secondary VLANs and consequently cannot apply the\n   segregation rules and\
    \ constraints characteristic of the private VLANs\n   architecture (an example\
    \ of one such constraint is explained in\n   [802.1Q], Section B.1.3).  This impact\
    \ is limited to traffic within\n   the private VLAN domain and will not affect\
    \ the regular Layer 2\n   forwarding behavior on other VLANs.\n   If the private\
    \ VLAN feature is properly deployed, it can be used at\n   Layer 2 to segregate\
    \ individual users or groups of users from each\n   other: this segregation allows\
    \ a network designer to more effectively\n   constrain Layer 2 forwarding so as\
    \ to, for instance, block or contain\n   unwanted inter-device communication like\
    \ port scans or Address\n   Resolution Protocol (ARP) poisoning attacks.\n"
