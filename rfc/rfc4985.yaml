  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   This document specifies a name form for inclusion in X.509\n\
    \   certificates that may be used by a certificate relying party to\n   verify\
    \ that a particular host is authorized to provide a specific\n   service within\
    \ a domain.\n   RFC 2782 [N3] defines a DNS RR (Resource Record) for specifying\
    \ the\n   location of services (SRV RR), which allows clients to ask for a\n \
    \  specific service/protocol for a specific domain and get back the\n   names\
    \ of any available servers.\n   Existing name forms in X.509 certificates support\
    \ authentication of a\n   host name.  This is useful when the name of the host\
    \ is known by the\n   client prior to authentication.\n   When a server host name\
    \ is discovered through DNS RR lookup query\n   based on service name, the client\
    \ may need to authenticate the\n   server's authorization to provide the requested\
    \ service in addition\n   to the server's host name.\n   While DNS servers may\
    \ have the capacity to provide trusted\n   information, there may be many other\
    \ situations where the binding\n   between the name of the host and the provided\
    \ service needs to be\n   supported by additional credentials.\n   Current dNSName\
    \ GeneralName Subject Alternative name form only\n   provides for DNS host names\
    \ to be expressed in \"preferred name\n   syntax\", as specified by RFC 1034 [N4].\
    \  This definition is therefore\n   not broad enough to allow expression of a\
    \ service related to that\n   domain.\n"

- title: 2.  Name Definitions
  contents:
  - "2.  Name Definitions\n   This section defines the SRVName name as a form of otherName\
    \ from the\n   GeneralName structure in SubjectAltName defined in RFC 3280 [N2].\n\
    \      id-on-dnsSRV OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { id-on 7 }\n      SRVName ::= IA5String\
    \ (SIZE (1..MAX))\n   The SRVName, if present, MUST contain a service name and\
    \ a domain\n   name in the following form:\n      _Service.Name\n   The content\
    \ of the components of this name form MUST be consistent\n   with the corresponding\
    \ definition of these components in an SRV RR\n   according to RFC 2782 [N3].\n\
    \   The content of these components are:\n      Service\n         The symbolic\
    \ name of the desired service, as defined in\n         Assigned Numbers [N5] or\
    \ locally.  An underscore (_) is\n         prepended to the service identifier\
    \ to avoid collisions with\n         DNS labels that occur in nature.  Some widely\
    \ used services,\n         notably POP, don't have a single universal name.  If\
    \ Assigned\n         Numbers names the service indicated, that name is the only\
    \ name\n         that is allowed in the service component of this name form.\n\
    \         The Service is case insensitive.\n      Name\n         The DNS domain\
    \ name of the domain where the specified service\n         is located.\n     \
    \    If the domain name is an Internationalized Domain Name (IDN),\n         then\
    \ encoding in ASCII form SHALL be done as defined in section\n         3.\n  \
    \ Even though this name form is based on the service resource record\n   (SRV\
    \ RR) definition in RFC 2782 [N3] and may be used to enhance\n   subsequent authentication\
    \ of DNS-based service discovery, this\n   standard does not define any new conditions\
    \ or requirements regarding\n   use of SRV RR for service discovery or where and\
    \ when such use is\n   appropriate.\n   The format of a DNS RR, according to RFC\
    \ 2782, also includes a\n   protocol component (_Service._Proto.Name).  This protocol\
    \ component\n   is not included in the SRVName specified in this document.  The\n\
    \   purpose of the SRVName is limited to authorization of service\n   provision\
    \ within a domain.  It is outside the scope of the SRVName to\n   provide any\
    \ means to verify that the host is using any intended\n   protocol.  By omitting\
    \ the protocol component from the SRVName two\n   important advantages have been\
    \ achieved:\n   * One certificate with a single SRVName can be issued to a host\
    \ that\n     offers multiple protocol alternatives.\n   * Name constraints processing\
    \ rules (specified in section 4)are\n     significantly less complex to define\
    \ without the protocol\n     component.\n   A present SRVName in a certificate\
    \ MUST NOT be used to identify a\n   host unless one of the following conditions\
    \ applies:\n   *  Use of this name form is specified by the security protocol\
    \ being\n      used and the identified service has a defined service name\n  \
    \    according to RFC 2782, or;\n   *  Use of this name form is configured by\
    \ local policy.\n"

  contents:
  - "3.  Internationalized Domain Names\n   IA5String is limited to the set of ASCII\
    \ characters.  To accommodate\n   internationalized domain names in the current\
    \ structure, conforming\n   implementations MUST convert internationalized domain\
    \ names to the\n   ASCII Compatible Encoding (ACE) format as specified in section\
    \ 4 of\n   RFC 3490 [N6] before storage in the Name part of SRVName.\n   Specifically,\
    \ conforming implementations MUST perform the conversion\n   operation specified\
    \ in section 4 of RFC 3490 [N6], with the following\n   clarifications:\n    \
    \  *  in step 1, the domain name SHALL be considered a \"stored\n         string\"\
    .  That is, the AllowUnassigned flag SHALL NOT be set;\n      *  in step 3, set\
    \ the flag called \"UseSTD3ASCIIRules\";\n      *  in step 4, process each label\
    \ with the \"ToASCII\" operation; and\n      *  in step 5, change all label separators\
    \ to U+002E (full stop).\n   When comparing DNS names for equality, conforming\
    \ implementations\n   MUST perform a case-insensitive exact match on the entire\
    \ domain\n   name.  When evaluating name constraints, conforming implementations\n\
    \   MUST perform a case-insensitive exact match on a label-by-label\n   basis.\n\
    \   Implementations SHOULD convert IDNs to Unicode before display.\n   Specifically,\
    \ conforming implementations SHOULD perform the\n   conversion operation specified\
    \ in section 4 of RFC 3490 [N6], with\n   the following clarifications:\n    \
    \  *  in step 1, the domain name SHALL be considered a \"stored\n         string\"\
    .  That is, the AllowUnassigned flag SHALL NOT be set;\n      *  in step 3, set\
    \ the flag called \"UseSTD3ASCIIRules\";\n      *  in step 4, process each label\
    \ with the \"ToUnicode\" operation;\n         and\n      *  skip step 5.\n   Note:\
    \  Implementations MUST allow for increased space requirements\n   for IDNs. \
    \ An IDN ACE label will begin with the four additional\n   characters \"xn--\"\
    \ and may require as many as five ASCII characters to\n   specify a single international\
    \ character.\n"
- title: 4.  Name Constraints Matching Rules
  contents:
  - "4.  Name Constraints Matching Rules\n   Name constraining, as specified in RFC\
    \ 3280, MAY be applied to the\n   SRVName by adding name restriction in the name\
    \ constraints extension\n   in the form of an SRVName.\n   SRVName restrictions\
    \ are expressed as a complete SRVName\n   (_mail.example.com), just a service\
    \ name (_mail), or just as a DNS\n   name (example.com).  The name restriction\
    \ of the service name part\n   and the DNS name part of SRVName are handled separately.\n\
    \   If a service name is included in the restriction, then that\n   restriction\
    \ can only be satisfied by an SRVName that includes a\n   corresponding service\
    \ name.  If the restriction has an absent service\n   name, then that restriction\
    \ is satisfied by any SRVName that matches\n   the domain part of the restriction.\n\
    \   DNS name restrictions are expressed as host.example.com.  Any DNS\n   name\
    \ that can be constructed by simply adding subdomains to the\n   left-hand side\
    \ of the name satisfies the DNS name part of the name\n   constraint.  For example,\
    \ www.host.example.com would satisfy the\n   constraint (host.example.com) but\
    \ 1host.example.com would not.\n   Examples:\n      Name Constraints\n      SRVName\
