A "MULTI TELNET" SUBSYSTEM FOR
TENEX INTRODUCTION MLTNET is a TELNET like facility for TENEX which enables a user to control a number of jobs, running on different ARPANET hosts.
It multiplexes the user's local console among the remote jobs.
MLTNET is useful in applications which require coordinated behavior of several network hosts.
In particular, we have found it helpful in debugging programs which make use of the network.
The MLTNET program is designed to be easy to use and, while used in remote mode, to be as transparent as possible to the user.
It is somewhat less sophisticated than the TENEX user TELNET program.
MLTNET is currently a subsystem on the BBN  TENEX host.
MLTNET MLTNET operates in two modes:
Local Mode Operation: When in local mode MLTNET interprets input types by the user as commands to it.
Commands consist of a mnemonic command name followed by zero or more parameters.
Included in the commands recognized by MLTNET are ones which enable the user to associate a name of his choice with a connection to an ARPANET site, to establish a connection with a named site, to list the network status as seen from the user's TENEX etc.
Remote Mode Operation When operating in remote mode MLTNET makes the user's console appear to be directly connected to a remote site.
It transmits input typed by the user to the remote site and prints output recieved from the remote site.
Output received from a remote site while the user is in local mode or is interacting with another remote site is buffered for the user by MLTNET.
MLTNET has been designed to be transparent to the user while operating in remote mode.
In particular, when in remote mode it transmits user types ^C
(CONTROL C, the TENEX "attention" character) and ^T
(CONTROL T, the TENEX "time used query" character) to the remote site.
Occasinally a user may find it necessary to modify the characteristics of a connection to a particular remote site.
For example, he may want to have MLTNET echo typed input as it is transmitted.
Or, he may be using a remote host which requires both upper and lower case characters from a local terminal which has only upper case; in such a case he would want MLTNET to transmit upper and lower case as appropriate.
In remote mode operation MLTNET recognizes "!"
as an escape character and interprets the character following it as a command to change the characterristics of the connection currently in use.
Commands recognized by MLTNET in remote mode are summerized in the next section.
Commands and command parameters may be editted as they are input.
The character ^A (CONTROL A) deletes the last character input.
In response to a ^A MLTNET types " deleted.
(CONTROL R) causes the input string as collected so far to be retyped (with all editting carried out).
The ALTMODE character (octal 175) may be used to invoke command recognition and completion.
If insufficient information is availble to recognize an input string as a command MLTNET responds to ALTMODE by ringing the terminal bell.
Any prefix which uniquely identifies a command is recognized as that command by MLTNET.
In the following, <name> and <site> denote command parameters.
They are strings terminated by a space or carriage return.
> is a user chosen string of 14 characters or less; site is either the name of an ARPANET host or the string "LOCAL".
The commands recognized by MLTNET in local mode are: ASSIGN:
syntax: ASSIGN <name> <site> effect:
Associates the user chosen string <name> with a connection to the ARPANET site <site
Switches from command mode to remote mode directing subsequent console input to the site associated with <name>.
If no ARPANET site is currently associated with <name>, the user is asked to spesify a site.
The first time the user "talks" to a particular named site MLTNET goes through the ARPANET initial connection protocol with the remote site in order to establish a duplex connection with it.
effect: Prints on the console the <name>/<site> associatins currently known to MLTNET.
: syntax: QUIT effect: Returns control to the TENEX
EXEC breaking all connections with remote hosts.
It is good practice to log out of each remote host before using the QUIT command.
NETSTAT effect: Prints on the console the network status as seen from the local TENEX.
syntax: RENAME <name>1 <name>2 effect:
Associates <name>2 with the ARPANET site previously associated with <name>1.
Breaks the network connection with the ARPANET site associated with <name> and, in addition, breaks the association between <name> and that site.
Prints on the console the list of hosts currently known to the MLTNET subsystem.
syntax: HELP Remote Mode Commands
In remote mode MLTNET recognizes the escape character "!"
as a signal to interpret the following character as a command.
Currently MLTNET recognizes the following characters as commands to it:
;L is the inverse of R. The default case.
: Causes MLTNET to transmit upper case letters typed to it as lower case letters.
The following is an annotated scenario which illustrates the use of MLTNET; in it characters typed by
