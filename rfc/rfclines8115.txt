Abstract This document defines a Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol version 6 (DHCPv6) Option for multicast IPv4 service continuity solutions, which is used to carry the IPv6 prefixes to be used to build unicast and multicast IPv4 embedded IPv6 addresses.
Introduction Several solutions (e.g., [RFC8114]) are proposed for the delivery of multicast services in the context of transition to IPv6.
Even if these solutions may have different applicable use cases, they all use specific IPv6 addresses that embed IPv4 addresses, for both multicast group and source addresses.
This document defines a DHCPv6 option [RFC3315] that carries the IPv6 prefixes to be used for constructing these IPv4 embedded IPv6 addresses.
In particular, this option can be used in the context of Dual Stack Lite (DS Lite)
[RFC6333], Stateless Address plus Port
[RFC6346], and other IPv4 IPv6 transition techniques.
The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119
This document makes use of the following terms: IPv4 embedded IPv6 address:  an IPv6 address that embeds a 32 bit  encoded IPv4 address
An IPv4 embedded IPv6 address can be a unicast or a multicast address.
an IPv6 prefix used for synthesizing IPv4 embedded IPv6 addresses.
A Prefix64 can be unicast or multicast.
Note: "64" is used as an abbreviation for IPv6 IPv4 interconnection.
ASM mPrefix64:  a multicast Prefix64 that belongs to the Any Source Multicast (ASM) range.
SSM mPrefix64:  a multicast Prefix64 which belongs to the Source  Specific Multicast (SSM)
uPrefix64:  a unicast Prefix64 for building the IPv4 embedded IPv6 addresses of multicast sources in SSM mode.
OPTION V6 PREFIX64 DHCPv6 Option OPTION V6 PREFIX64
(Figure 1) conveys the IPv6 prefix(es)
to be used (e.g., by an mB4 [RFC8114]) to synthesize IPv4 embedded IPv6 addresses.
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
The fields of the option shown in Figure 1 are as follows:
option length:  length of the option, in octets.
asm length:  the prefix length for the ASM IPv4 embedded prefix, as an 8 bit unsigned integer.
This field represents the number of valid leading bits in the prefix.
This field MUST be set to 96.
ASM mPrefix64:  this field identifies the IPv6 multicast prefix to be used to synthesize the IPv4 embedded IPv6 addresses of the multicast groups in the ASM mode.
The conveyed multicast IPv6 prefix MUST belong to the ASM range.
ssm length:  the prefix length for the SSM IPv4 embedded prefix, as an 8 bit unsigned integer.
This field represents the number of valid leading bits in the prefix.
This field MUST be set to 96.
this field identifies the IPv6 multicast prefix to be used to synthesize the IPv4 embedded IPv6 addresses of the multicast groups in SSM mode.
The conveyed multicast IPv6 prefix MUST belong to the SSM range.
unicast length:  the prefix length for the IPv6 unicast prefix to be used to synthesize the IPv4 embedded IPv6 addresses of the multicast sources, as an 8 bit unsigned integer.
As specified in [RFC6052], the unicast length MUST be one of 32, 40, 48, 56, 64, or 96.
This field represents the number of valid leading bits in the prefix.
uPrefix64:  this field identifies the IPv6 unicast prefix to be used in SSM mode for constructing the IPv4 embedded IPv6 addresses representing the IPv4 multicast sources in the IPv6 domain.
uPrefix64 may also be used to extract the IPv4 address from the received multicast data flows.
It is a variable size field with the length of the field defined by the unicast length field and is rounded up to the nearest octet boundary.
In this case, any additional padding bits must be zeroed.
The address mapping MUST follow the guidelines documented in [RFC6052].
Multiple instances of OPTION V6 PREFIX64 may be returned to a DHCPv6 client.
Configuration recommendations for DHCP servers are listed in Appendix A. Note that it was tempting to define three distinct DHCPv6 options, but that approach was not adopted because it has a side effect: the specification of a DHCPv6 option that could be used to discover unicast Prefix64s in environments where multicast is not enabled.
Such a side effect conflicts with the recommendation to support the Well Known DNS Name heuristic discovery based method for unicast only environments (Section 6 of [RFC7051]).
To retrieve the IPv6 prefixes that will be used to synthesize unicast and multicast IPv4 embedded IPv6 addresses, the DHCPv6 client MUST include the OPTION V6 PREFIX64 code in its OPTION ORO.
If the DHCPv6 client receives more than one OPTION V6 PREFIX64 option from the DHCPv6 server:
If each enclosed IPv6 multicast prefix has a distinct scope [RFC7346], the client MUST select the appropriate IPv6 multicast prefix whose scope matches the IPv4 multicast address used to synthesize an IPv4 embedded IPv6 multicast address.
If at least two of the received options convey IPv6 multicast prefixes that have the same scope, the said options MUST be discarded.
If asm length, ssm length and unicast length fields are all set to 0, the DHCPv6 client MUST behave as if OPTION V6 PREFIX64 had not been received in the response received from the DHCPv6 server.
If the asm length field is non null,
the IPv6 prefix identified by ASM mPrefix64 is used to synthesize IPv4 embedded IPv6 multicast addresses in the ASM range.
This is achieved by concatenating the ASM mPrefix64 and the IPv4 multicast address; the IPv4 multicast address is inserted in the last 32 bits of the IPv4 embedded IPv6 multicast address.
If the ssm length field is non null,
the IPv6 prefix identified by SSM mPrefix64 is used to synthesize IPv4 embedded IPv6 multicast addresses in the SSM range.
This is achieved by concatenating the SSM mPrefix64 and the IPv4 multicast address; the IPv4 multicast address is inserted in the last 32 bits of the IPv4 embedded IPv6 multicast address.
If the unicast length field is non null,
the IPv6 prefix identified by uPrefix64 is used to synthesize IPv4 embedded IPv6 unicast addresses as specified in [RFC6052].
The security considerations documented in [RFC3315] and [RFC6052] are to be considered.

113 Appendix A.  Configuration Recommendations for DHCP Servers
This appendix details a set of non normative configuration recommendations:
DHCP servers supporting OPTION V6 PREFIX64 must be configured with ASM mPrefix64 or SSM mPrefix64, and may be configured with both.
uPrefix64 must also be configured when SSM mPrefix64 is provided.
uPrefix64 may be configured when ASM mPrefix64 is provided.
Note that uPrefix64 is not mandatory for the ASM case if, for example, a local address mapping algorithm is supported or the Well Known Prefix (64:ff9b::/96) is used.
Both ASM mPrefix64 and SSM mPrefix64 may be configured and therefore be returned to a requesting DHCP client in the same OPTION V6 PREFIX64.
In particular, if both SSM and ASM modes are supported, ASM mPrefix64 and SSM mPrefix64 prefixes must be configured.
For SSM deployments, both SSM mPrefix64 and uPrefix64 must be configured.
When a multicast Prefix64 (
ASM mPrefix64 or SSM mPrefix64) is configured, the length of the prefix must be /96.
When distinct IPv6 multicast address scopes [RFC7346] are required to preserve the scope when translating IPv4 multicast addresses (Section 8 of [RFC2365])
, each scope is configured as a separate OPTION V6 PREFIX64.
How DHCP servers are configured to separate multicast Prefix64 per scope is implementation specific and not covered by this document.
When scope preservation is not required, only one instance of OPTION V6 PREFIX64 is configured.
