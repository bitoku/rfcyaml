  - "Abstract\n   This document gives a more concrete definition of \"the IETF\" as\
    \ it\n   understood today.  Many RFCs refer to \"the IETF\".  Many important\n\
    \   IETF documents speak of the IETF as if it were an already-defined\n   entity.\
    \  However, no IETF document correctly defines what the IETF\n   is.\n"

    \ speak\n   of the IETF as if it were an already-defined entity.  However, no\n\
    \   IETF document correctly defines what the IETF is.  This document\n   gives\
    \ a more concrete definition of \"the IETF\" as it understood\n   today.\n"
- title: 2. Defining the IETF
  contents:
  - "2. Defining the IETF\n   BCP 9 (\"The Internet Standards Process -- Revision\
    \ 3\") [BCP 9], the\n   primary document that describes the Internet standards\
    \ process, never\n   defines the IETF.  As described in BCP 11 (\"The Organizations\n\
    \   Involved in the IETF Standards Process\") [BCP 11], the Internet\n   Engineering\
    \ Task Force (IETF) is an open global community of network\n   designers, operators,\
    \ vendors, and researchers producing technical\n   specifications for the evolution\
    \ of the Internet architecture and the\n   smooth operation of the Internet.\n\
    \   It is important to note that the IETF is not a corporation: it is an\n   unincorporated,\
    \ freestanding organization.  The IETF is partially\n   supported by the Internet\
    \ Society (ISOC).  ISOC is an international\n   non-profit organization incorporated\
    \ in the US with thousands of\n   individual and corporate members throughout\
    \ the world who pay\n   membership fees to join.  The Internet Society provides\
    \ many services\n   to the IETF, including insurance and some financial and logistical\n\
    \   support.\n   As described in BCP 11, Internet standardization is an organized\n\
    \   activity of the ISOC, with the ISOC Board of Trustees being\n   responsible\
    \ for ratifying the procedures and rules of the Internet\n   standards process.\
    \  However, the IETF is not a formal subset of ISOC;\n   for example, one does\
    \ not have to join ISOC to be a member of the\n   IETF.\n   There is no board\
    \ of directors for the IETF, no formally signed\n   bylaws, no treasurer, and\
    \ so on.  The structure of the IETF (its\n   leadership, its working groups, the\
    \ definition of IETF membership,\n   and so on) are described in detail in BCP\
    \ 11.  Procedures for\n   choosing leadership are described in detail in BCP 10.\n\
    \   Thus, when RFCs say \"the IETF\", they are describing the group that\n   acts\
    \ in accordance with BCP 9, BCP 10, and BCP 11.\n"
- title: 3. Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "3. Security Considerations\n   All IETF protocols must describe the security\
    \ aspects of the\n   environment in which they will be used.  Also, the IETF has\
    \ a\n   Security Area which discusses the security aspects of IETF protocols.\n\
    \   However, descriptive documents such as this one do not affect the\n   security\
    \ of the Internet.\n"
