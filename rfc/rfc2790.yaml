- title: 1.  The SNMP Management Framework
  contents:
  - "1.  The SNMP Management Framework\n   The SNMP Management Framework presently\
    \ consists of five major\n   components:\n   o   An overall architecture, described\
    \ in RFC 2571 [RFC2571].\n   o   Mechanisms for describing and naming objects\
    \ and events for the\n       purpose of management. The first version of this\
    \ Structure of\n       Management Information (SMI) is called SMIv1 and described\
    \ in STD\n       16, RFC 1155 [RFC1155], STD 16, RFC 1212 [RFC1212] and RFC 1215\n\
    \       [RFC1215]. The second version, called SMIv2, is described in STD\n   \
    \    58, RFC 2578 [RFC2578], RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and RFC 2580\n       [RFC2580].\n\
    \   o   Message protocols for transferring management information. The\n     \
    \  first version of the SNMP message protocol is called SNMPv1 and\n       described\
    \ in STD 15, RFC 1157 [RFC1157]. A second version of the\n       SNMP message\
    \ protocol, which is not an Internet standards track\n       protocol, is called\
    \ SNMPv2c and described in RFC 1901 [RFC1901]\n       and RFC 1906 [RFC1906].\
    \ The third version of the message protocol\n       is called SNMPv3 and described\
    \ in RFC 1906 [RFC1906], RFC 2572\n       [RFC2572] and RFC 2574 [RFC2574].\n\
    \   o   Protocol operations for accessing management information. The\n      \
    \ first set of protocol operations and associated PDU formats is\n       described\
    \ in STD 15, RFC 1157 [RFC1157]. A second set of protocol\n       operations and\
    \ associated PDU formats is described in RFC 1905\n       [RFC1905].\n   o   A\
    \ set of fundamental applications described in RFC 2573 [RFC2573]\n       and\
    \ the view-based access control mechanism described in RFC 2575\n       [RFC2575].\n\
    \   A more detailed introduction to the current SNMP Management Framework\n  \
    \ can be found in RFC 2570 [RFC2570].\n   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual\
    \ information store, termed\n   the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects\
    \ in the MIB are\n   defined using the mechanisms defined in the SMI.\n   This\
    \ memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2. A\n   MIB conforming\
    \ to the SMIv1 can be produced through the appropriate\n   translations. The resulting\
    \ translated MIB must be semantically\n   equivalent, except where objects or\
    \ events are omitted because no\n   translation is possible (use of Counter64).\
    \ Some machine readable\n   information in SMIv2 will be converted into textual\
    \ descriptions in\n   SMIv1 during the translation process.  However, this loss\
    \ of machine\n   readable information is not considered to change the semantics\
    \ of the\n   MIB.\n"
- title: 2.  Host Resources MIB
  contents:
  - "2.  Host Resources MIB\n   The Host Resources MIB defines a uniform set of objects\
    \ useful for\n   the management of host computers.  Host computers are independent\
    \ of\n   the operating system, network services, or any software application.\n\
    \   The Host Resources MIB defines objects which are common across many\n   computer\
    \ system architectures.\n   In addition, there are objects in the SNMPv2-MIB [RFC1907]\
    \ and IF-MIB\n   [RFC2233] which also provide host management functionality.\n\
    \   Implementation of the System and Interfaces groups is mandatory for\n   implementors\
    \ of the Host Resources MIB.\n   The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\"\
    , \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\",\"\
    MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n   document are to be interpreted as described\
    \ in [RFC2119].\n"
- title: 3.  IANA Considerations
  contents:
  - "3.  IANA Considerations\n   This MIB contains type definitions for storage types,\
    \ device types,\n   and file system types for use as values for the hrStorageType,\n\
    \   hrDeviceType, and hrFSType objects, respectively. As new computing\n   technologies\
    \ are developed, new types need to be registered for these\n   technologies. The\
    \ IANA (Internet Assigned Numbers Authority) is\n   designated as the registration\
    \ authority for new registrations beyond\n   those published in this document.\
    \ The IANA will maintain the HOST-\n   RESOURCES-TYPES module as new registrations\
    \ are added and publish new\n   versions of this module.\n   Given the large number\
    \ of such technologies and potential confusion\n   in naming of these technologies\
    \ (such as a technology known by two\n   names or a name and an acronym), there\
    \ is a real danger that more\n   than one registration might be created for what\
    \ is essentially the\n   same technology. In order to ensure that future type\
    \ registrations\n   are performed correctly, applications for new types will be\
    \ reviewed\n   by a Designated Expert appointed by the IESG.\n"

- title: 6.  Internationalization Considerations
  contents:
  - "6.  Internationalization Considerations\n   This MIB has many objects that identify\
    \ file-system pathnames on the\n   managed host. Many file systems allow pathnames\
    \ to be encoded in a\n   variety of character sets (other than ASCII), but do\
    \ not support the\n   encoding of the actual character set used with the pathname.\
    \ The\n   implementation strategy is that user interfaces (i.e. character-based\n\
    \   shells or graphical applications) will have configuration options\n   that\
    \ control with which character set they will interpret and display\n   all pathnames.\
    \ This is often a per-user configuration (e.g. an\n   environment variable), so\
    \ that users using different languages and\n   character sets on a multi-user\
    \ system may each work effectively with\n   their preferred character set. A human\
    \ usually controls this\n   configuration. If an application is not configured\
    \ or is configured\n   incorrectly, it will often have trouble displaying pathnames\
    \ in the\n   intended character set.\n   This situation made it important for\
    \ this MIB to handle two issues:\n   1) Pathname objects must be able to transfer\
    \ a variety of character\n      sets with potentially multi-byte encodings; and,\n\
    \   2) HostMIB agents will generally not be correctly configured for the\n   \
    \   appropriate character set to be used for all files on the system,\n      particularly\
    \ on a system with multiple users using different\n      character sets. It was\
    \ thus impossible to mandate that the agent\n      tag pathnames with the character\
    \ set in use.\n   These issues were solved with the introduction of the\n   InternationalDisplayString\
    \ textual convention, which supports multi-\n   byte encodings. Network management\
    \ stations should use a local\n   algorithm to determine which character set is\
    \ in use and how it\n   should be displayed. It is expected that network management\
    \ station\n   applications will rely on human configuration to choose which\n\
    \   character set in which to interpret InternationalDisplayString\n   objects,\
    \ much like an application running locally on that host.\n"
- title: 7.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "7.  Security Considerations\n   There are a number of management objects defined\
    \ in this MIB that\n   have a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write.  Such objects may\
    \ be\n   considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.  The\n\
    \   support for SET operations in a non-secure environment without proper\n  \
    \ protection can have a negative effect on system operations.\n   There are a\
    \ number of managed objects in this MIB that may contain\n   sensitive information.\
    \ The objects in the Running Software Group list\n   information about running\
    \ software on the system (including the\n   operating system software and version).\
    \  Some may wish not to\n   disclose to others what software they are running.\
    \ Further, an\n   inventory of the running software and versions may be helpful\
    \ to an\n   attacker who hopes to exploit software bugs in certain applications.\n\
    \   The same issues exist for the objects in the Installed Software\n   Group.\n\
    \   It is thus important to control even GET access to these objects and\n   possibly\
    \ to even encrypt the values of these object when sending them\n   over the network\
    \ via SNMP.  Not all versions of SNMP provide features\n   for such a secure environment.\n\
    \   SNMPv1 by itself is not a secure environment.  Even if the network\n   itself\
    \ is secure (for example by using IPSec), even then, there is no\n   control as\
    \ to who on the secure network is allowed to access and\n   GET/SET (read/change/create/delete)\
    \ the objects in this MIB.\n   It is recommended that the implementers consider\
    \ the security\n   features as provided by the SNMPv3 framework.  Specifically,\
    \ the use\n   of the User-based Security Model RFC 2574 [RFC2574] and the View-\n\
    \   based Access Control Model RFC 2575 [RFC2575] is recommended.\n   It is then\
    \ a customer/user responsibility to ensure that the SNMP\n   entity giving access\
    \ to an instance of this MIB, is properly\n   configured to give access to the\
    \ objects only to those principals\n   (users) that have legitimate rights to\
    \ indeed GET or SET\n   (change/create/delete) them.\n"
