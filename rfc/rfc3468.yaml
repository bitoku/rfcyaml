- title: 2. Background
  contents:
  - "2. Background\n   Very early (1997) in the MPLS standardization it was clear\
    \ that a\n   protocol would be needed that would enable providers to setup LSPs\n\
    \   that took other information (e.g., various QoS parameters) into\n   account.\n\
    \   Development of this type of signalling protocol took two different\n   tracks:\n\
    \   -  extensions to RSVP for setting up MPLS tunnels [RFC3209]\n   -  extensions\
    \ to LDP for setting constraint based LSPs [RFC3212]\n   The motivation for the\
    \ choice of protocol in both cases was\n   straightforward.  Extending RSVP-TE\
    \ to do in an MPLS environment what\n   it already was doing (handling QoS information\
    \ and reserving\n   resources) in an IP environment is comprehensible; you only\
    \ have to\n   add the label distribution capability.  Extending a native MPLS\n\
    \   protocol like LDP, which was designed to do label distribution, to\n   handle\
    \ some extra TLVs with QoS information is also not\n   revolutionary.\n   The\
    \ MPLS group never reached a consensus on which way to go.  Both\n   protocols\
    \ were progressed to proposed standard.\n"
- title: 3.  CCAMP implementation study
  contents:
  - "3.  CCAMP implementation study\n   An implementation survey of GMPLS implementations\
    \ was published in\n   June 2002 [GMPLS].  The survey includes responses from\
    \ 22 different\n   implementers.  Twenty-one of 22 implementations include the\
    \ GMPLS\n   signalling based on [RFC3209], while only 3 include signalling based\n\
    \   on [RFC3212].\n"
- title: 4.  MPLS Working Group discussion

  - '4.  MPLS Working Group discussion

    '
- title: 4.1 Phase 1
  contents:
  - "4.1 Phase 1\n   The GMPLS implementation report prompted questions asking if\
    \ it was\n   reasonable to have two different protocols for the same thing.  The\n\
    \   discussion was brought to the MPLS Working Group at the meeting in\n   Yokohama\
    \ in July 2002.  After discussion at the meeting it was\n   decided to \"bring\
    \ this to the list\" and also invite comments from the\n   other Sub-IP Area Working\
    \ Groups.\n   The following question sent to the mailing lists:\n   \"As there\
    \ are issues with having two similar standards (potentially\n   diverging), and\
    \ it generates duplicate work in several IETF working\n   groups, the question\
    \ was asked whether we should make CR-LDP\n   informational (which still make\
    \ it available and possible to work\n   with) and progress only RSVP-TE on the\
    \ standards track.\"\n   The response to this question was largely positive, but\
    \ some problems\n   were immediately pointed out:\n   -  there are non-IETF standards\
    \ which reference RFC 3212.  Taking\n      CR-LDP off the standards track would\
    \ cause un-necessary problems\n      for those organizations and should be done\
    \ only after co-\n      ordinating with those organizations\n   -  there is, e.g.,\
    \ in RFC 2026 [RFC2026], no documented process\n      according to which a document\
    \ on the standards track may be move\n      to a status that is non-standards\
    \ track\n   Each of these arguments is by themselves strong and would have led\
    \ to\n   some reformulation of the proposal to move CR-LDP to informational.\n\
    \   Moreover, in combination it was clear that the original proposal was\n   not\
    \ viable.\n   On the other hand the support for doing additional development of\n\
    \   CR-LDP as an IETF standards track alternative to RSVP-TE was\n   extremely\
    \ small.\n"
- title: 4.2 IETF process
  contents:
  - "4.2 IETF process\n   The current IETF process for managing changes in RFC status\
    \ does not\n   include any information on how to move an existing standard track\
    \ RFC\n   to a non-standard track status, nor does it include a prohibition of\n\
    \   such an action.  It has been shown that such actions have been\n   previously\
    \ taken e.g., RFCs 2673 and 2874 were moved from Proposed\n   Standard to Experimental.\
    \  Though the cases are not exactly parallel\n   to the MPLS signalling case it\
    \ shows that the IETF and IESG are\n   prepared to take such decisions given that\
    \ the arguments are\n   sufficiently strong.\n"
- title: 4.3  Relationship to other standards organizations
  contents:
  - "4.3  Relationship to other standards organizations\n   The relationship with\
    \ other standard organizations is an important\n   part of IETF work.  We are\
    \ dependent on their work and they make use\n   of our technology; each organization\
    \ has their own area of expertise.\n   It is therefore necessary that both sides\
    \ handle their standards\n   documentation in such a way that no unnecessary updates\
    \ or revisions\n   are introduced simply by sloppy handling of documents.\n  \
    \ Consequently we need to keep CR-LDP referenceable, i.e., on the\n   standards\
    \ track, for the foreseeable future.  The implication of this\n   is not that\
    \ we need to progress it further, or need to undertake\n   further work in the\
    \ area.  One implication however is that standards\n   organizations which reference\
    \ the document, need to be notified of\n   our decision so that they (at their\
    \ own pace) can change their\n   references to more appropriate documents.  It\
    \ is also expected that\n   they will notify us when they no longer have a need\
    \ to normative\n   reference to CR-LDP.\n"
- title: 4.4 Phase 2
  contents:
  - "4.4 Phase 2\n   Based on the feed back from this first discussion the question\
    \ to the\n   working group were reformulated as:\n   \"Should the MPLS WG focus\
    \ its efforts on a signalling protocol for\n   traffic engineering applications\
    \ on RSVP-TE, and hence the WG effort\n   with CR-LDP be discontinued?  This would\
    \ not involve any change in\n   document status for CR-LDP, nor would it hinder\
    \ continued individual\n   contributions in the CR-LDP space.  It would involve\
    \ a change in the\n   MPLS WG charter to reflect this.\"\n   It was pointed out\
    \ that \"nor would it hinder continued individual\n   contributions\" is too weak.\
    \  We actually discourage, while it is not\n   prohibited, continued work in the\
    \ CR-LDP area.  That is the whole\n   point with taking this decision.\n   It\
    \ was also pointed out that while it is quite acceptable to not\n   accept further\
    \ working group documents, it would also be appropriate\n   to take the existing\
    \ CR-LDP related working group Internet Drafts\n   through the process to proposed\
    \ standard or informational as\n   intended.  This is applicable to the following\
    \ documents, since much\n   of the work has already been completed on them:\n\
    \      - in MPLS WG\n       -- Multi Protocol Label Switching Label Distribution\
    \ Protocol\n          Query Message Description\n       -- Improving Topology\
    \ Data Base Accuracy with Label Switched Path\n       -- Feedback in Constraint\
    \ Based Label Distribution Protocol\n       -- Signalling Unnumbered Links in\
    \ CR-LDP\n       -- Fault Tolerance for the Label Distribution Protocol (LDP)\n\
    \      - in CCAMP WG\n       -- Generalized MPLS Signaling - CR-LDP Extensions\n\
    \       -- Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching Extensions for\n       \
    \   SONET and SDH Control\n       -- Generalized MPLS Signalling Extensions for\
    \ G.709 Optical\n          Transport Networks Control\n       -- Generalized Multiprotocol\
    \ Label Switching Extensions to\n          Control Non-Standard SONET and SDH\
    \ Features\n   Some of the documents listed above are not in themselves extensions\n\
    \   to CR-LDP, but in one way or another are deemed to be \"equally\n   applicable\
    \ to CR-LDP\".  For those documents it will be fully\n   appropriate to progress\
    \ them beyond proposed standard in the future\n   if they meet the requirements.\n\
    \   RFCs that are extensions to CR-LDP, e.g., RFCs 3213 and 3214, will\n   remain\
    \ proposed standard documents.\n   After this compromise was proposed a good consensus\
    \ quickly formed\n   supporting the proposal.  Close to 90% of the people participating\n\
    \   discussion said that they support or at least accept this outcome of\n   the\
    \ working group discussion.\n"
