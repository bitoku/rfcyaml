Abstract This document updates RFC 3161.
It allows the use of ESSCertIDv2, as defined in RFC 5035, to specify the hash of a signer certificate when the hash is calculated with a function other than the Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA 1).
The time stamping protocol defined in RFC 3161 [RFC3161] requires that the Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) SignedData [RFC5652], used to apply a digital signature on the time stamp token, include a signed attribute that identifies the signer's certificate.
This identifier only allows SHA 1 [SHA1] to be used as the hash algorithm to generate the identifier value.
The mechanism used in [RFC3161] employed ESSCertID from RFC 2634
[ESSV2] updated ESSCertID with ESSCertIDv2 to allow the use of any hash algorithm.
The changes to RFC 3161
[RFC3161] defined in this document allow ESSCertIDv2 to be used to include an identifier of the signing certificate as defined in RFC 5035
The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119
Updates to RFC 3161 2.1.
Changes to Section 2.4.1, Request Format Last paragraph on Page 5.
Old: If the certReq field is present and set to true, the TSA's public key certificate that is referenced by the ESSCertID identifier inside a SigningCertificate attribute in the response MUST be provided by the TSA in the certificates field from the SignedData structure in that response.
That field may also contain other certificates.
If the certReq field is present and set to true, the TSA's public key certificate that is referenced by the ESSCertID [ESS] field inside a SigningCertificate attribute or by the ESSCertIDv2 [ESSV2] field inside a SigningCertificateV2 attribute in the response MUST be provided by the TSA in the certificates field from the SignedData structure in that response.
That field may also contain other certificates.
Changes to Section 2.4.2, Response Format 2.2.1.
Signature of Time Stamp Token Fifth paragraph on Page 8, just before the definition of TSTInfo.
The time stamp token MUST NOT contain any signatures other than the signature of the TSA.
The certificate identifier (ESSCertID) of the TSA certificate MUST be included as a signerInfo attribute inside a SigningCertificate attribute.
The time stamp token MUST NOT contain any signatures other than the signature of the TSA.
The certificate identifier (either ESSCertID [ESS] or ESSCertIDv2 [ESSV2]) of the TSA certificate MUST be included as a signerInfo attribute inside a SigningCertificate attribute.
Note: As mentioned in RFC 5035 [ESSV2], the SigningCertificateV2 attribute MUST be used if any algorithm other than SHA 1 is used and SHOULD NOT be used for SHA 1.
Note: For backwards compatibility, in line with RFC 5035, both ESSCertID and ESSCertIDv2 MAY be present.
Systems MAY ignore ESSCertIDv2 if RFC 5035 has not been implemented.
Verifying the Time Stamp Token Third paragraph on Page 11.
Old: The purpose of the tsa field is to give a hint in identifying the name of the TSA.
If present, it MUST correspond to one of the subject names included in the certificate that is to be used to verify the token.
However, the actual identification of the entity that signed the response will always occur through the use of the certificate identifier (ESSCertID Attribute) inside a SigningCertificate attribute which is part of the signerInfo (See Section 5 of [ESS]).
New: The purpose of the tsa field is to give a hint in identifying the name of the TSA.
If present, it MUST correspond to one of the subject names included in the certificate that is to be used to verify the token.
However, the actual identification of the entity that signed the response will always occur through the use of the certificate identifier (ESSCertID inside a SigningCertificate attribute or ESSCertIDv2 inside a SigningCertificateV2 attribute)
that is part of the signerInfo (see Section 5 of [ESS] and Section 3 of [ESSV2]).
This document incorporates the security considerations of RFC 5035 [ESSV2] with further explanations in this section.
ESSCertID provides a means based on the SHA 1 hash algorithm for identifying the certificate used to verify the signature on a time stamp.
The use of ESSCertIDv2 aims to enable implementers to comply with policies that require phasing out all uses of the SHA 1 algorithm.
The update provided by this document is motivated by reasons of interoperability and migration to other hash algorithms rather than mitigating new security issues.
