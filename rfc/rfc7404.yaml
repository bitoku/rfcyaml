- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   An infrastructure link between a set of routers typically\
    \ does not\n   require global or unique local addresses [RFC4193].  Using only\
    \ link-\n   local addressing on such links has a number of advantages; for\n \
    \  example, routing tables do not need to carry link addressing and can\n   therefore\
    \ be significantly smaller.  This helps to decrease failover\n   times in certain\
    \ routing convergence events.  An interface of a\n   router is also not reachable\
    \ beyond the link boundaries, therefore\n   reducing the attack surface.\n   This\
    \ document discusses the advantages and caveats of this approach.\n   Note that\
    \ some traditional techniques used to operate a network, such\n   as pinging interfaces\
    \ or seeing interface information in a\n   traceroute, do not work with this approach.\
    \  Details are discussed\n   below.\n   During WG and IETF last call, the technical\
    \ correctness of the\n   document was reviewed; however, debate exists as to whether\
    \ to\n   recommend this technique.  The deployment of this technique is\n   appropriate\
    \ where it is found to be necessary.\n"
- title: 2.  Using Link-Local Addressing on Infrastructure Links
  contents:
  - "2.  Using Link-Local Addressing on Infrastructure Links\n   This document discusses\
    \ the approach of using only link-local\n   addresses (LLAs) on all router interfaces\
    \ on infrastructure links.\n   Routers don't typically need to receive packets\
    \ from hosts or nodes\n   outside the network.  For a network operator, there\
    \ may be reasons to\n   use addresses that are greater than link-local scope on\n\
    \   infrastructure interfaces for certain operational tasks, such as\n   pings\
    \ to an interface or traceroutes across the network.  This\n   document discusses\
    \ such cases and proposes alternative procedures.\n"
- title: 2.1.  The Approach
  contents:
  - "2.1.  The Approach\n   In this approach, neither globally routed IPv6 addresses\
    \ nor unique\n   local addresses are configured on infrastructure links.  In the\n\
    \   absence of specific global or unique local address definitions, the\n   default\
    \ behavior of routers is to use link-local addresses, notably\n   for routing\
    \ protocols.\n   The sending of ICMPv6 [RFC4443] error messages (\"packet-too-big\"\
    ,\n   \"time-exceeded\", etc.) is required for routers.  Therefore, another\n\
    \   interface must be configured with an IPv6 address that has a greater\n   scope\
    \ than link-local.  This address will usually be a loopback\n   interface with\
    \ a global scope address belonging to the operator and\n   part of an announced\
    \ prefix (with a suitable prefix length) to avoid\n   being dropped by other routers\
    \ implementing ingress filtering\n   [RFC3704].  This is implementation dependent.\
    \  For the remainder of\n   this document, we will refer to this interface as\
    \ a \"loopback\n   interface\".\n   [RFC6724] recommends that IPv6 addresses that\
    \ are greater than link-\n   local scope be used as the source IPv6 address for\
    \ all generated\n   ICMPv6 messages sent to a non-link-local address, with the\
    \ exception\n   of ICMPv6 redirect messages (as defined in Section 4.5 of [RFC4861]).\n\
    \   The effect on specific traffic types is as follows:\n   o  Most control plane\
    \ protocols (such as BGP [RFC4271], IS-IS\n      [IS-IS], OSPFv3 [RFC5340], Routing\
    \ Information Protocol Next\n      Generation (RIPng) [RFC2080], and PIM [RFC4609])\
    \ work by default\n      or can be configured to work with link-local addresses.\n\
    \      Exceptions are explained in the caveats section (Section 2.3).\n   o  Management\
    \ plane traffic (such as Secure SHell (SSH) Protocol\n      [RFC4251], Telnet\
    \ [RFC0495], Simple Network Management Protocol\n      (SNMP) [RFC1157], and ICMPv6\
    \ Echo Request [RFC4443]) can use the\n      address of the router loopback interface\
    \ as the destination\n      address.  Router management can also be done over\
    \ out-of-band\n      channels.\n   o  ICMP error messages are usually sourced\
    \ from a loopback interface\n      with a scope that is greater than link-local.\
    \  Section 4.5 of\n      [RFC4861] explains one exception: ICMP redirect messages\
    \ can also\n      be sourced from a link-local address.\n   o  Data plane traffic\
    \ is forwarded independently of the link address\n      type.\n   o  Neighbor\
    \ discovery (neighbor solicitation and neighbor\n      advertisement) is done\
    \ by using link-local unicast and multicast\n      addresses.  Therefore, neighbor\
    \ discovery is not affected.\n   Thus, we conclude that it is possible to construct\
    \ a working network\n   in this way.\n"
- title: 2.2.  Advantages
  contents:
  - "2.2.  Advantages\n   The following list of advantages is in no particular order.\n\
    \   Smaller routing tables: Since the routing protocol only needs to\n   carry\
    \ one global address (the loopback interface) per router, it is\n   smaller than\
    \ the traditional approach where every infrastructure link\n   address is carried\
    \ in the routing protocol.  This reduces memory\n   consumption and increases\
    \ the convergence speed in some routing\n   failover cases.  Because the Forwarding\
    \ Information Base to be\n   downloaded to line cards is smaller, and there are\
    \ fewer prefixes in\n   the Routing Information Base, the routing algorithm is\
    \ accelerated.\n   Note that smaller routing tables can also be achieved by putting\n\
    \   interfaces in passive mode for the Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP).\n   Simpler\
    \ address management: Only loopback interface addresses need to\n   be considered\
    \ in an addressing plan.  This also allows for easier\n   renumbering.\n   Lower\
    \ configuration complexity: Link-local addresses require no\n   specific configuration,\
    \ thereby lowering the complexity and size of\n   router configurations.  This\
    \ also reduces the likelihood of\n   configuration mistakes.\n   Simpler DNS:\
    \ Less routable address space in use also means less\n   reverse and forward mapping\
    \ DNS resource records to maintain.  Of\n   course, if the operator selects not\
    \ to enter any global interface\n   addresses in the DNS anyway, then this is\
    \ less of an advantage.\n   Reduced attack surface: Every routable address on\
    \ a router\n   constitutes a potential attack point; a remote attacker can send\n\
    \   traffic to that address, for example, a TCP SYN flood (see\n   [RFC4987]).\
    \  If a network only uses the addresses of the router\n   loopback interface(s),\
    \ only those addresses need to be protected from\n   outside the network.  This\
    \ may ease protection measures, such as\n   Infrastructure Access Control Lists\
    \ (iACL).  Without using link-local\n   addresses, it is still possible to achieve\
    \ the simple iACL if the\n   network addressing scheme is set up such that all\
    \ link and loopback\n   interfaces have addresses that are greater than link-local\
    \ and are\n   aggregatable, and if the infrastructure access list covers that\n\
    \   entire aggregated space.  See also [RFC6752] for further discussion\n   on\
    \ this topic.  [RFC6860] describes another approach to hide\n   addressing on\
    \ infrastructure links for OSPFv2 and OSPFv3 by modifying\n   the existing protocols.\
    \  This document does not modify any protocol\n   and applies only to IPv6.\n"
- title: 2.3.  Caveats
  contents:
  - "2.3.  Caveats\n   The caveats listed in this section are in no particular order.\n\
    \   Interface ping: If an interface doesn't have a routable address, it\n   can\
    \ only be pinged from a node on the same link.  Therefore, it is\n   not possible\
    \ to ping a specific link interface remotely.  A possible\n   workaround is to\
    \ ping the loopback address of a router instead.  In\n   most cases today, it\
    \ is not possible to see which link the packet was\n   received on; however, [RFC5837]\
    \ suggests including the interface\n   identifier of the interface a packet was\
    \ received on in the ICMPv6\n   response.  It must be noted that there are few\
    \ implementations of\n   this ICMPv6 extension.  With this approach, it would\
    \ be possible to\n   ping a router on the addresses of loopback interfaces, yet\
    \ see which\n   interface the packet was received on.  To check liveliness of\
    \ a\n   specific interface, it may be necessary to use other methods, such as\n\
    \   connecting to the router via SSH and checking locally or using SNMP.\n   Traceroute:\
    \ Similar to the ping case, a reply to a traceroute packet\n   would come from\
    \ the address of a loopback interface, and current\n   implementations do not\
    \ display the specific interface the packets\n   came in on.  Again, [RFC5837]\
    \ provides a solution.  As in the ping\n   case above, it is not possible to traceroute\
    \ to a particular\n   interface if it only has a link-local address.  Conversely,\
    \ this\n   approach may make network topology discovery from outside the network\n\
    \   simpler: instead of responding with multiple different interface IP\n   addresses,\
    \ which have to be correlated by the outsider, a router will\n   always respond\
    \ with the same loopback address.  If reverse DNS\n   mapping is used, the mapping\
    \ is trivial in either case.\n   Hardware dependency: LLAs have usually been based\
    \ on 64-bit Extended\n   Unique Identifiers (EUI-64); hence, they change when\
    \ the Message\n   Authentication Code (MAC) address is changed.  This could pose\
    \ a\n   problem in a case where the routing neighbor must be configured\n   explicitly\
    \ (e.g., BGP) and a line card needs to be physically\n   replaced, hence changing\
    \ the EUI-64 LLA and breaking the routing\n   neighborship.  LLAs can be statically\
    \ configured, such as fe80::1 and\n   fe80::2, which can be used to configure\
    \ any required static routing\n   neighborship.  However, this static LLA configuration\
    \ may be more\n   complex to operate than statically configured addresses that\
    \ are\n   greater than link-local scope.  This is because LLAs are inherently\n\
    \   ambiguous.  For a multi-link node, such as a router, to deal with the\n  \
    \ ambiguity, the link zone index must also be considered explicitly,\n   e.g.,\
    \ using the extended textual notation described in [RFC4007], as\n   in this example,\
    \ 'BGP neighbor fe80::1%eth0 is down'.\n   Network Management System (NMS) toolkits:\
    \ If there is any NMS tool\n   that makes use of an interface IP address of a\
    \ router to carry out\n   any of its NMS functions, then it would no longer work\
    \ if the\n   interface does not have a routable address.  A possible workaround\n\
    \   for such tools is to use the routable address of the router loopback\n   interface\
    \ instead.  Most vendor implementations allow the\n   specification of loopback\
    \ interface addresses for SYSLOG, IPFIX, and\n   SNMP.  The Link Layer Discovery\
    \ Protocol (LLDP) (IEEE 802.1AB-2009)\n   runs directly over Ethernet and does\
    \ not require any IPv6 address, so\n   dynamic network discovery is not hindered\
    \ by using only LLA when\n   using LLDP.  But, network discovery based on Neighbor\
    \ Discovery\n   Protocol (NDP) cache content will only display the link-local\n\
    \   addresses and not the addresses of the loopback interfaces;\n   therefore,\
    \ network discovery should rather be based on the Route\n   Information Base to\
    \ detect adjacent nodes.\n   MPLS and RSVP-Traffic Engineering (RSVP-TE) [RFC3209]\
    \ allow the\n   establishment of an MPLS Label Switched Path (LSP) on a path that\
    \ is\n   explicitly identified by a strict sequence of IP prefixes or\n   addresses\
    \ (each pertaining to an interface or a router on the path).\n   This is commonly\
    \ used for Fast Reroute (FRR).  However, if an\n   interface uses only a link-local\
    \ address, then such LSPs cannot be\n   established.  At the time of writing this\
    \ document, there is no\n   workaround for this case; therefore, where RSVP-TE\
    \ is being used, the\n   approach described in this document does not work.\n"
- title: 2.4.  Internet Exchange Points
  contents:
  - "2.4.  Internet Exchange Points\n   Internet Exchange Points (IXPs) have a special\
    \ importance in the\n   global Internet because they connect a high number of\
    \ networks in a\n   single location and because a significant part of Internet\
    \ traffic\n   passes through at least one IXP.  An IXP requires, therefore, a\
    \ very\n   high level of security.  The address space used on an IXP is\n   generally\
    \ known, as it is registered in the global Internet Route\n   Registry, or it\
    \ is easily discoverable through traceroute.  The IXP\n   prefix is especially\
    \ critical because practically all addresses on\n   this prefix are critical systems\
    \ in the Internet.\n   Apart from general device security guidelines, there are\
    \ basically\n   two additional ways to raise security (see also [BGP-OPSEC]):\n\
    \   1.  Not to announce the prefix in question, and\n   2.  To drop all traffic\
    \ from remote locations destined to the IXP\n       prefixes.\n   Not announcing\
    \ the prefix of the IXP would frequently result in\n   traceroute and similar\
    \ packets (required for Path MTU Discovery\n   (PMTUD)) being dropped due to unicast\
    \ Reverse Path Forwarding (uRPF)\n   checks.  Given that PMTUD is critical, this\
    \ is generally not\n   acceptable.  Dropping all external traffic to the IXP prefix\
    \ is hard\n   to implement because if only one service provider connected to an\
    \ IXP\n   does not filter correctly, then all IXP routers are reachable from at\n\
    \   least that service provider network.\n   As the prefix used in the IXP is\
    \ usually longer than a /48, it is\n   frequently dropped by route filters on\
    \ the Internet having the same\n   net effect as not announcing the prefix.\n\
    \   Using link-local addresses on the IXP may help in this scenario.  In\n   this\
    \ case, the generated ICMPv6 packets would be generated from\n   loopback interfaces\
    \ or from any other interface with a globally\n   routable address without any\
    \ configuration.  However, in this case,\n   each service provider would use their\
    \ own address space, making a\n   generic attack against all devices on the IXP\
    \ harder.  All of an\n   IXP's loopback interface addresses can be discovered\
    \ by a potential\n   attacker with a simple traceroute; a generic attack is, therefore,\n\
    \   still possible, but it would require more work.\n   In some cases, service\
    \ providers carry the IXP addresses in their IGP\n   for certain forms of traffic\
    \ engineering across multiple exit points.\n   Link-local addresses cannot be\
    \ used for this purpose; in this case,\n   the service provider would have to\
    \ employ other methods of traffic\n   engineering.\n   If an Internet Exchange\
    \ Point is using a global prefix registered for\n   this purpose, a traceroute\
    \ will indicate whether the trace crosses an\n   IXP rather than a private interconnect.\
    \  If link-local addressing is\n   used instead, a traceroute will not provide\
    \ this distinction.\n"
