  - "1.  Introduction\n   In order to help ensure interworking between instant messaging\
    \ (IM)\n   systems that conform to the instant messaging / presence requirements\n\
    \   [RFC2779], it is important to clearly define protocol mappings\n   between\
    \ such systems.  Within the IETF, work has proceeded on two\n   instant messaging\
    \ technologies:\n   o  Various extensions to the Session Initiation Protocol ([RFC3261])\n\
    \      for instant messaging, in particular the MESSAGE method extension\n   \
    \   [RFC3428]; collectively the capabilities of SIP with these\n      extensions\
    \ are commonly called SIP for Instant Messaging and\n      Presence Leveraging\
    \ Extensions (SIMPLE).\n   o  The Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP),\
    \ which\n      consists of a formalization of the core XML streaming protocols\n\
    \      developed originally by the Jabber open-source community; the\n      relevant\
    \ specifications are [RFC6120] for the XML streaming layer\n      and [RFC6121]\
    \ for basic presence and instant messaging extensions.\n   One approach to helping\
    \ ensure interworking between these protocols\n   is to map each protocol to the\
    \ abstract semantics described in\n   [RFC3860]; that is the approach taken by\
    \ [SIMPLE-CPIM] and [RFC3922].\n   In contrast, the approach taken in this document\
    \ is to directly map\n   semantics from one protocol to another (i.e., from SIP\
    \ / SIMPLE to\n   XMPP and vice versa), since that is how existing systems solve\
    \ the\n   interworking problem.\n   Both XMPP systems and IM-capable SIP systems\
    \ enable entities to\n   exchange \"instant messages\".  The term \"instant message\"\
    \ usually\n   refers to a message sent between two entities for delivery in close\n\
    \   to real time (rather than a message that is stored and forwarded to\n   the\
    \ intended recipient upon request).  This document specifies\n   mappings only\
    \ for single messages (sometimes called \"pager-mode\"\n   messaging), since they\
    \ form the lowest common denominator for IM.\n   Separate documents cover \"session-mode\"\
    \ instant messaging in the form\n   of one-to-one chat sessions [RFC7573] and\
    \ multi-party chat sessions\n   [GROUPCHAT].  In particular, session-mode instant\
    \ messaging supports\n   several features that are not part of pager-mode instant\
    \ messaging,\n   such as a higher level of assurance regarding end-to-end message\n\
    \   delivery.  As with all of these documents, the architectural\n   assumptions\
    \ underlying such direct mappings are provided in\n   [RFC7247], including mapping\
    \ of addresses and error conditions.\n"

  contents:
  - "2.  Intended Audience\n   The documents in this series are intended for use by\
    \ software\n   developers who have an existing system based on one of these\n\
    \   technologies (e.g., SIP) and who would like to enable communication\n   from\
    \ that existing system to systems based on the other technology\n   (e.g., XMPP).\
    \  We assume that readers are familiar with the core\n   specifications for both\
    \ SIP [RFC3261] and XMPP [RFC6120], with the\n   base document for this series\
    \ [RFC7247], and with the following\n   IM-related specifications:\n   o  \"Session\
    \ Initiation Protocol (SIP) Extension for Instant\n      Messaging\" [RFC3428]\n\
    \   o  \"Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP): Instant\n      Messaging\
    \ and Presence\" [RFC6121]\n   Note well that not all protocol-compliant messages\
    \ are shown (such as\n   SIP 100 TRYING messages), in order to focus the reader\
    \ on the\n   essential aspects of the protocol flows.\n"

- title: 4.  XMPP to SIP
  contents:
  - "4.  XMPP to SIP\n   As described in [RFC6121], a single instant message is an\
    \ XML\n   <message/> stanza of type \"normal\" sent over an XML stream (since\n\
    \   \"normal\" is the default for the 'type' attribute of the <message/>\n   stanza,\
    \ the attribute is often omitted).\n   When the XMPP user Juliet with a Jabber\
    \ Identifier (JID) of\n   <juliet@example.com> wants to send an instant message\
    \ to Romeo, she\n   interacts with her XMPP client, which generates an XMPP <message/>\n\
    \   stanza.  The syntax of the <message/> stanza, including required and\n   optional\
    \ elements and attributes, is defined in [RFC6121] (for single\n   instant messages,\
    \ Section 5.1 of [RFC6121] recommends that the value\n   of the 'to' address be\
    \ a \"bare JID\" of the form\n   \"localpart@domainpart\").  The following is\
    \ an example of such a\n   stanza:\n   Example 1: XMPP User Sends Message\n  \
    \ |  <message from='juliet@example.com/yn0cl4bnw0yr3vym'\n   |           to='romeo@example.net'>\n\
    \   |    <body>Art thou not Romeo, and a Montague?</body>\n   |  </message>\n\
    \   Upon receiving such a message stanza, the XMPP server needs to\n   determine\
    \ the identity of the domainpart in the 'to' address, which\n   it does by following\
    \ the procedures explained in Section 5 of\n   [RFC7247].  If the domain is a\
    \ SIP domain, the XMPP server will hand\n   off the message stanza to an XMPP-to-SIP\
    \ gateway or connection\n   manager that natively communicates with IM-aware SIP\
    \ servers.\n   The XMPP-to-SIP gateway is then responsible for translating the\
    \ XMPP\n   message stanza into a SIP MESSAGE request from the XMPP user to the\n\
    \   SIP user:\n   Example 2: XMPP User Sends Message (SIP Transformation)\n  \
    \ |  MESSAGE sip:romeo@example.net SIP/2.0\n   |  Via: SIP/2.0/TCP x2s.example.com;branch=z9hG4bK776sgdkse\n\
    \   |  Max-Forwards: 70\n   |  To: sip:romeo@example.net\n   |  From: <sip:juliet@example.com;gr=yn0cl4bnw0yr3vym>;tag=12345\n\
    \   |  Call-ID: D9AA95FD-2BD5-46E2-AF0F-6CFAA96BDDFA\n   |  CSeq: 1 MESSAGE\n\
    \   |  Content-Type: text/plain\n   |  Content-Length: 35\n   |\n   |  Art thou\
    \ not Romeo, and a Montague?\n   The destination SIP server is responsible for\
    \ delivering the message\n   to the intended recipient, and the recipient is responsible\
    \ for\n   generating a response (e.g., 200 OK).\n   Example 3: SIP User Agent\
    \ Indicates Receipt of Message\n   |  SIP/2.0 200 OK\n   |  Via: SIP/2.0/TCP x2s.example.com;branch=z9hG4bK776sgdkse\n\
    \   |  From: sip:juliet@example.com;tag=12345\n   |  To: sip:romeo@example.net;tag=vwxyz\n\
    \   |  Call-ID: D9AA95FD-2BD5-46E2-AF0F-6CFAA96BDDFA\n   |  CSeq: 1 MESSAGE\n\
    \   |  Content-Length: 0\n   As described in [RFC3428], a downstream proxy could\
    \ fork a MESSAGE\n   request, but it would return only one 200 OK to the gateway.\n\
    \      Note: This document does not specify handling of the 200 OK by the\n  \
    \    XMPP-to-SIP gateway (e.g., to enable message acknowledgements).\n      See\
    \ [RFC7573] for a mapping of message acknowledgements in the\n      context of\
    \ one-to-one chat sessions.\n   The mapping of XMPP syntax to SIP syntax MUST\
    \ be as shown in the\n   following table.\n   Table 1: Message Syntax Mapping\
    \ from XMPP to SIP\n      +-----------------------------+--------------------------+\n\
    \      |  XMPP Element or Attribute  |  SIP Header or Contents  |\n      +-----------------------------+--------------------------+\n\

    \                   |  Content-Language        |\n      +-----------------------------+--------------------------+\n\
    \   1.  As shown in the foregoing example and described in [RFC7247], the\n  \
    \     XMPP-to-SIP gateway MUST map the bare JID\n       (\"localpart@domainpart\"\
    ) of the XMPP sender to the SIP From\n       header and include the resourcepart\
    \ of the \"full JID\"\n       (\"localpart@domainpart/resourcepart\") as the Globally\
    \ Routable\n       User Agent URI (GRUU) portion [RFC5627] of the SIP URI.\n \
    \  2.  Because there is no SIP header field that matches the meaning of\n    \
    \   the XMPP message 'type' values (\"normal\", \"chat\", \"groupchat\",\n   \
    \    \"headline\", \"error\"), no general mapping is possible here.\n"
- title: 5.  SIP to XMPP
  contents:
  - "5.  SIP to XMPP\n   As described in [RFC3428], a single instant message is a\
    \ SIP MESSAGE\n   request sent from a SIP user agent to an intended recipient\
    \ who is\n   most generally referenced by an Instant Messaging (IM) URI [RFC3861]\n\
    \   of the form <im:user@domain> but who might be referenced by a SIP or\n   SIPS\
    \ URI of the form <sip:user@domain> or <sips:user@domain>.\n   When a SIP user\
    \ Romeo with a SIP URI of <sip:romeo@example.net> wants\n   to send an instant\
    \ message to Juliet, he interacts with his SIP user\n   agent, which generates\
    \ a SIP MESSAGE request.  The syntax of the\n   MESSAGE request is defined in\
    \ [RFC3428].  The following is an example\n   of such a request:\n   Example 4:\
    \ SIP User Sends Message\n   |  MESSAGE sip:juliet@example.com SIP/2.0\n   | \
    \ Via: SIP/2.0/TCP s2x.example.net;branch=z9hG4bKeskdgs677\n   |  Max-Forwards:\
    \ 70\n   |  To: sip:juliet@example.com\n   |  From: sip:romeo@example.net;tag=vwxyz\n\
    \   |  Call-ID: 9E97FB43-85F4-4A00-8751-1124FD4C7B2E\n   |  CSeq: 1 MESSAGE\n\
    \   |  Content-Type: text/plain\n   |  Content-Length: 44\n   |\n   |  Neither,\
    \ fair saint, if either thee dislike.\n   Section 5 of [RFC3428] stipulates that\
    \ a SIP user agent presented\n   with an im: URI should resolve it to a sip: or\
    \ sips: URI.  Therefore,\n   we assume that the Request-URI of a request received\
    \ by an IM-capable\n   SIP-to-XMPP gateway will contain a sip: or sips: URI. \
    \ Upon receiving\n   the MESSAGE, the SIP server needs to determine the identity\
    \ of the\n   domain portion of the Request-URI or To header, which it does by\n\
    \   following the procedures explained in Section 5 of [RFC7247].  If the\n  \
    \ domain is an XMPP domain, the SIP server will hand off the MESSAGE to\n   an\
    \ associated SIP-to-XMPP gateway or connection manager that natively\n   communicates\
    \ with XMPP servers.\n   The SIP-to-XMPP gateway is then responsible for translating\
    \ the\n   request into an XMPP message stanza from the SIP user to the XMPP\n\
    \   user and returning a SIP 200 OK message to the sender:\n   Example 5: SIP\
    \ User Sends Message (XMPP Transformation)\n   |  <message from='romeo@example.net/dr4hcr0st3lup4c'\n\
    \   |           to='juliet@example.com'>\n   |    <body>Neither, fair saint, if\
    \ either thee dislike.</body>\n   |  </message>\n   Note that the stanza-handling\
    \ rules specified in [RFC6121] allow the\n   receiving XMPP server to deliver\
    \ a message stanza whose 'to' address\n   is a bare JID (\"localpart@domainpart\"\
    ) to multiple connected devices.\n   This is similar to the \"forking\" of messages\
    \ in SIP.\n   The mapping of SIP syntax to XMPP syntax MUST be as shown in the\n\

    \ resourcepart.\n   When transforming SIP pager-mode messages, an IM-capable SIP-to-XMPP\n\
    \   gateway MUST specify no XMPP 'type' attribute or, equivalently, a\n   'type'\
    \ attribute whose value is \"normal\" [RFC6121].\n   See Section 7 of this document\

- title: 6.  Message Size
  contents:
  - "6.  Message Size\n   [RFC3428] specifies that (outside of a media session) the\
    \ size of a\n   MESSAGE request is not allowed to exceed 1300 bytes.  Although,\
    \ in\n   practice, XMPP instant messages do not often exceed that size,\n   neither\
    \ [RFC6120] nor [RFC6121] sets an upper limit on the size of\n   XMPP stanzas.\
    \  However, XMPP server deployments usually do limit the\n   size of stanzas in\
    \ order to help prevent denial-of-service attacks,\n   and [RFC6120] states that\
    \ if a server sets a maximum stanza size,\n   then the limit is not allowed to\
    \ be less than 10,000 bytes.  Because\n   of this mismatch, an XMPP-to-SIP gateway\
    \ SHOULD return a <policy-\n   violation/> stanza error if an XMPP user attempts\
    \ to send an XMPP\n   message stanza that would result in a SIP MESSAGE greater\
    \ than 1300\n   bytes.  Although such a gateway might decide to \"upgrade\" from\
    \ page\n   mode to session mode using the Message Session Relay Protocol (MSRP)\n\
    \   -- thus treating the instant message as part of a chat session as\n   described\
    \ in [RFC7573] -- such behavior is application-specific and\n   this document\
    \ provides no guidelines for how to complete such an\n   upgrade.\n"
- title: 7.  Content Types
  contents:
  - "7.  Content Types\n   SIP requests of type \"MESSAGE\" are allowed to contain\
    \ essentially any\n   content type.  The recommended procedures for SIP-to-XMPP\
    \ gateways to\n   use in handling these content types are as follows.\n   An IM-aware\
    \ SIP-to-XMPP gateway MUST process SIP messages that\n   contain message bodies\
    \ of type \"text/plain\" and MUST encapsulate such\n   message bodies as the XML\
    \ character data of the XMPP <body/> element.\n   An IM-aware SIP-to-XMPP gateway\

    ; if so, a gateway MUST\n   transform the \"text/html\" content into XHTML content\
    \ that conforms to\n   the XHTML-IM Integration Set specified in [XEP-0071].\n\
    \   Although an IM-aware SIP-to-XMPP gateway MAY process SIP messages\n   that\
    \ contain message bodies of types other than \"text/plain\" and\n   \"text/html\"\

  - "9.  Security Considerations\n   Detailed security considerations are given in\
    \ the following\n   documents:\n   o  For instant messaging protocols in general,\
    \ see [RFC2779]\n   o  For SIP-based instant messaging, see [RFC3428] and also\
    \ [RFC3261]\n   o  For XMPP-based instant messaging, see [RFC6121] and also [RFC6120]\n\
    \   o  For SIP-XMPP interworking in general, see [RFC7247]\n   This document specifies\
    \ methods for exchanging \"pager-mode\" instant\n   messages through a gateway\
    \ that translates between SIP and XMPP, and\n   [RFC7573] specifies such methods\
    \ for \"session-mode\" instant messaging\n   between MSRP and XMPP.  Such a gateway\
    \ MUST be compliant with the\n   minimum security requirements of the textual\
    \ chat protocols for which\n   it translates (i.e., SIP or MSRP and XMPP).\n \
    \  The addition of gateways to the security model of instant messaging\n   specified\
    \ in [RFC2779] introduces some new risks.  In particular,\n   end-to-end security\
    \ properties (especially confidentiality and\n   integrity) between instant messaging\
    \ clients that interface through a\n   gateway can be provided only if common\
    \ formats are supported.\n   Specification of those common formats is out of scope\
    \ for this\n   document.  For instant messages, it is possible to use the methods\n\
    \   described in [RFC3862] and [RFC3923], but those methods are not\n   widely\
    \ implemented.  A more widely implemented, albeit\n   nonstandardized, method\
    \ for interoperable end-to-end encryption would\n   be Off-the-Record Messaging\
    \ [OTR].\n"
