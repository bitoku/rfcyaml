  - "Abstract\n   RFC 3261 constrained several SIP header fields whose grammar contains\n\
    \   the \"name-addr / addr-spec\" alternative to use name-addr when certain\n\
    \   characters appear.  Unfortunately, it expressed the constraints with\n   prose\
    \ copied into each header field definition, and at least one\n   header field\
    \ was missed.  Further, the constraint has not been copied\n   into documents\
    \ defining extension headers whose grammar contains the\n   alternative.\n   This\
    \ document updates RFC 3261 to state the constraint generically\n   and clarifies\
    \ that the constraint applies to all SIP header fields\n   where there is a choice\
    \ between using name-addr or addr-spec.  It\n   also updates the RFCs that define\
    \ extension SIP header fields using\n   the alternative to clarify that the constraint\
    \ applies (RFCs 3325,\n   3515, 3892, 4508, 5002, 5318, 5360, and 5502).\n"

  - "1.  Introduction\n   [RFC3261] defines several header fields that contain URIs\
    \ to allow\n   both a form that contains the bare URI (addr-spec) and one that\n\
    \   provides a name and the URI (name-addr).  This subset, taken from the\n  \
    \ ABNF [RFC5234] specified in [RFC3261], shows the relevant part of the\n   definition\
    \ of the syntax of the \"From\" header field:\n     From        =  ( \"From\"\
    \ / \"f\" ) HCOLON from-spec\n     from-spec   =  ( name-addr / addr-spec )\n\
    \                    *( SEMI from-param )\n     name-addr      =  [ display-name\
    \ ] LAQUOT addr-spec RAQUOT\n     addr-spec      =  SIP-URI / SIPS-URI / absoluteURI\n\
    \   The prose in Section 20.20 of [RFC3261], which discusses the \"From\"\n  \
    \ header field, constrains how the production may be used by saying:\n      Even\
    \ if the \"display-name\" is empty, the \"name-addr\" form\n      MUST be used\
    \ if the \"addr-spec\" contains a comma, question\n      mark, or semicolon.\n\
    \   Section 20.39 of [RFC3261], which discusses the \"To\" header field,\n   contains\
    \ no such constraining text.\n   This constraint is specified slightly differently,\
    \ but with the same\n   intent, in the introduction to Section 20 of [RFC3261]:\n\
    \     The Contact, From, and To header fields contain a URI.  If the URI\n   \
    \  contains a comma, question mark or semicolon, the URI MUST be\n     enclosed\
    \ in angle brackets (< and >).\n   Unfortunately, this can be read to only apply\
    \ to the Contact, From,\n   and To header fields, making it necessary to provide\
    \ the constraint\n   explicitly in the prose discussing any other header field\
    \ using the\n   name-addr or addr-spec alternative.\n   As extension header fields\
    \ were standardized, the specifications\n   sometimes failed to include the constraint.\
    \  Many errata have been\n   entered to correct this omission.  When the constraint\
    \ has been\n   included, the requirement to use the name-addr form has not been\n\
    \   consistently stated.\n   This memo updates the specifications of SIP and its\
    \ extensions to\n   clarify that the constraint to use the name-addr form applies\n\
    \   anywhere there is a choice between the name-addr and addr-spec\n   production\
    \ rules in the grammar for SIP header fields.\n   It is important to note that\
    \ a message formed without honoring the\n   constraint will still be syntactically\
    \ valid, but it would very\n   likely be interpreted differently.  The characters\
    \ after the comma,\n   question mark, or semicolon will, in most cases, be interpreted\
    \ as\n   header field parameters or additional header field values as\n   discussed\
    \ in Section 7.3.1 of [RFC3261].  (An exception is the\n   degenerate case of\
    \ a URL like sip:10.0.0.1,@10.0.0.0 where it is\n   possible to parse the comma\
    \ via the 'user' production).\n"

    \  contains a comma, question mark or semicolon, the URI MUST be\n     enclosed\

    \ these brackets.  If the URI is not enclosed in\n     angle brackets, any semicolon-delimited\
    \ parameters are\n     header-parameters, not URI parameters.\n   is replaced\

    \     allows choosing between name-addr and addr-spec, such as those\n     that\
    \ use the form '(name-addr / addr-spec)', the addr-spec form\n     MUST NOT be\
    \ used if its value would contain a comma, semicolon,\n     or question mark.\n\
    \     When a URI appears in such a header field, any URI parameters MUST\n   \
