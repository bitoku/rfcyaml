Abstract This document describes implementation codepoints within Intermediate System to Intermediate System (IS IS) used today by several ISPs for routing within their clouds.
IS is an interior gateway routing protocol developed originally by OSI and used with IP extensions as Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP).
This document summarizes all Table, Length and Value (TLV) codepoints that are being used by the protocol and its pending extensions.

This document is provided to avoid possible future conflicts in the assignment of TLV numbers.
It does not constitute or represent any standard or authority assigning TLV numbers.
TLV assignment happens on a shared, informational basis between the ISO, SIF and the IETF working groups.
The core ISIS protocol is being specified in the ISO standards body, IP extensions to it however are products of the ISIS working group in IETF.
Since ISO does not provide a numbering authority and IANA is only responsible for IP related coding points, no plausible central authority to assign TLV numbers exists as of today.
This document will be periodically updated by newer versions in the fashion of [RP94] and successors.
It may be replaced at any given point in time by some type of official registry.
This document will not indicate specific documents using the codepoints, nor will it resolve the sub TLV codepoints.
Security Consideration ISIS security applies to the work presented.
No specific security issues are being introduced.
