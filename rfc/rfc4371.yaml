- title: 1.  Introduction

  - "1.  Introduction\n   The first version of BCP 101, i.e., RFC 4071 [1], assumed\
    \ that the\n   vehicle for certain IETF-related Intellectual Property Rights (IPR)\n\
    \   would be the Internet Society (ISOC).  Since that time, an IETF Trust\n  \
    \ has been created to hold such IPR.  This document appropriately\n   updates\
    \ RFC 4071.\n   This update comes into force as soon as it has been approved by\
    \ the\n   IESG and the IETF Trust Agreement [2] has been formally signed by its\n\
    \   Settlors and initial Trustees.\n   Terms and abbreviations used in this document\
    \ are defined in RFC\n   4071.\n"
- title: 2.  Updates to RFC 4071
  contents:
  - "2.  Updates to RFC 4071\n   A Trust (\"the IETF Trust\") has been formed for\
    \ the purpose of\n   acquiring, holding, maintaining, and licensing certain existing\
    \ and\n   future intellectual property and other property used in connection\n\
    \   with the administration of the IETF.  The Trust was formed by the\n   signatures\
    \ of its Settlors and initial Trustees.  The Settlors, who\n   contributed initial\
    \ intellectual property to the Trust, were ISOC and\n   the Corporation for National\
    \ Research Initiatives.  The Trustees of\n   the IETF Trust are the members of\
    \ the IAOC, and the Beneficiary of\n   the IETF Trust is the IETF as a whole.\n\
    \   In its administration of IPR under the terms of BCP 101, the IASA,\n   including\
    \ the IAD and the IAOC, will treat the IETF Trust rather than\n   ISOC as the\
    \ proper entity for ownership and licensing of IETF IPR.\n   Specifically, references\
    \ to ISOC in sections 3.1, 5.3, and 7 of [1]\n   shall be interpreted as referring\
    \ to the IETF Trust wherever IPR\n   issues are concerned.  The duty to serve\
    \ as Trustees is added to\n   section 3.2 of [1].\n"
