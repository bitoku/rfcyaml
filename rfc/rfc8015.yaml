    - "1.1.  Independent Burst/Gap Discard Metrics Block\n   This document defines
      a new block type that extends the metrics\n   defined in [RFC7003].  The new
      block type reports the proportion of\n   packets discarded in a burst by the
      de-jitter buffer at the receiver.\n   The number of packets discarded depends
      on the de-jitter buffer\n   algorithm implemented by the endpoint.\n   The new
      report block defined in this document is different from the\n   one defined
      in [RFC7003].  The metrics in [RFC7003] depend on the\n   metrics in the burst/gap
      loss metric defined in [RFC6958].\n   Consequently, an endpoint that sends a
      Burst/Gap Discard Metrics\n   Block [RFC7003] also needs to send a Burst/Gap
      Loss Metrics Block\n   [RFC6958].  The combined usage is useful when an endpoint
      observes\n   correlated packet losses and discard.  However, when the burst
      of\n   packet losses and discards do not occur simultaneously, the\n   application
      could prefer to send a concise report block that just\n   reports the burst/gap
      of discarded packets.  The report block in this\n   document provides the complete
      information and does not require\n   additional report blocks.  That is, this
      block reports the total\n   number of packets discarded, the total burst duration,
      and the total\n   number of bursts.  All of these metrics are missing in [RFC7003].\n
      \  This block provides information on transient network issues.  Burst/\n   gap
      metrics are typically used in cumulative reports; however, they\n   can also
      be used in interval reports (see the Interval Metric flag in\n   Section 3.2).
      \ The variation in the number of packet discards in a\n   burst affects the
      user experience.  Based on the metrics reported in\n   the block, the sending
      endpoint can change the packetization\n   interval, vary the bitrate, etc.  The
      report can additionally be used\n   for diagnostics [RFC6792].  The metric belongs
      to the class of\n   transport-related end-system metrics defined in [RFC6792].\n
      \  The definitions of \"burst\", \"gap\", \"loss\", and \"discard\" are\n   consistent
      with the definitions in [RFC3611].  To accommodate a range\n   of de-jitter
      buffer algorithms and packet discard logic that can be\n   used by implementers,
      the method used to distinguish between bursts\n   and gaps uses an equivalent
      method to that defined in Section 4.7.2\n   of [RFC3611].  Note that reporting
      the specific de-jitter buffer\n   algorithm and/or the packet discard logic
      is out of the scope of this\n   document.\n"

  - "2.  Terminology\n   The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\",
    \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\"
    in this\n   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].\n
    \  In addition, the following terms are defined:\n   Received, Lost, and Discarded\n
    \     A packet is regarded as \"lost\" if it fails to arrive within an\n      implementation-specific
    time window.  A packet that arrives within\n      this time window but is too
    early to be played out, too late to be\n      played out, or thrown away before
    playout due to packet\n      duplication or redundancy is be recorded as \"discarded\".
    \ A packet\n      SHALL NOT be regarded as \"discarded\" if it arrives within
    this\n      time window but is dropped during decoding by some higher-layer\n
    \     decoder, e.g., due to a decoding error.  Each packet is classified\n      as
    one of \"received\" (or \"OK\"), \"discarded\", or \"lost\".  The\n      metric
    \"cumulative number of packets lost\" defined in [RFC3550]\n      reports a count
    of packets lost from the media stream (single\n      synchronization source (SSRC)
    within a single RTP session).\n      Similarly, the metric \"number of packets
    discarded\" defined in\n      [RFC7002] reports a count of packets discarded from
    the media\n      stream (single SSRC within a single RTP session) arriving at
    the\n      receiver.  Another metric, defined in [RFC5725], is available to\n
    \     report on packets that are not recovered by any repair techniques\n      that
    are in use.  Note that the term \"discard\" defined here builds\n      on the
    \"discard\" definition in [RFC3611] but extends the concept\n      to take into
    account packet duplication and reports different\n      types of discard counts
    [RFC7002].\n   Bursts and Gaps\n      The terms \"burst\" and \"gap\" are used
    in a manner consistent with\n      that of RTCP XR [RFC3611].  RTCP XR views an
    RTP stream as being\n      divided into bursts, which are periods during which
    the discard\n      rate is high enough to cause noticeable quality degradation\n
    \     (generally a discard rate over 5 percent), and gaps, which are\n      periods
    during which discarded packets are infrequent, and hence\n      quality is generally
    acceptable.\n"

    separate\n   auxiliary Measurement Information Block [RFC6776], which describes\n
    \  measurement periods in use (see [RFC6776], Section 4.2).\n   This metrics block
    relies on the measurement period in the\n   Measurement Information Block indicating

      \  Block Type (BT): 8 bits\n      An Independent Burst/Gap Discard Metrics Block
      is identified by\n      the constant 35.\n   Interval Metric flag (I): 2 bits\n
      \     This field is used to indicate whether the burst/gap discard\n      metrics
      are Sampled, Interval, or Cumulative metrics [RFC6792]:\n         I=10: Interval
      Duration - the reported value applies to the\n         most recent measurement
      interval duration between successive\n         metrics reports.\n         I=11:
      Cumulative Duration - the reported value applies to the\n         accumulation
      period characteristic of cumulative measurements.\n      In this document, burst/gap
      discard metrics can only be measured\n      over definite intervals and cannot
      be sampled.  Also, the value\n      I=00 is reserved for future use.  Senders
      MUST NOT use the values\n      I=00 or I=01.  If a block is received with I=00
      or I=01, the\n      receiver MUST discard the block.\n   Reserved (resv): 6
      bits\n      These bits are reserved.  They MUST be set to zero by senders and\n
      \     ignored by receivers (see [RFC6709], Section 4.2).\n   Block Length: 16
      bits\n      The length of this report block in 32-bit words, minus one.  For\n
      \     the Independent Burst/Gap Discard Metrics Block, the block length\n      is
      equal to 5.  The block MUST be discarded if the block length is\n      set to
      a different value.\n   SSRC of Source: 32 bits\n      As defined in Section
      4 of [RFC3611].\n   Threshold: 8 bits\n      The Threshold is equivalent to
      Gmin in [RFC3611], i.e., the number\n      of successive packets that have to
      be received prior to, and\n      following, a discarded packet in order for
      that discarded packet\n      to be regarded as part of a gap.  Note that the

      4.7.2\n      of [RFC3611].\n   Sum of Burst Durations (ms): 24 bits\n      The
      total duration of bursts of discarded packets in the period of\n      the report
      (Interval or Cumulative).\n      The measured value is an unsigned value.  If
      the measured value\n      exceeds 0xFFFFFD, the value 0xFFFFFE MUST be reported
      to indicate\n      an over-range measurement.  If the measurement is unavailable,
      the\n      value 0xFFFFFF MUST be reported.\n   Packets Discarded in Bursts:
      24 bits\n      The total number of packets discarded during discard bursts,
      as\n      defined in Section 3.2 of [RFC7002].\n   Number of Bursts: 16 bits\n
      \     The number of discard bursts in the period of the report (Interval\n      or
      Cumulative).\n      The measured value is an unsigned value.  If the measured
      value\n      exceeds 0xFFFD, the value 0xFFFE MUST be reported to indicate an\n
      \     over-range measurement.  If the measurement is unavailable, the\n      value
      0xFFFF MUST be reported.\n   Total Packets Expected in Bursts: 24 bits\n      The
      total number of packets expected during the discard bursts\n      (that is,
      the sum of received packets and lost packets).  The\n      metric is defined
      in [RFC7003].\n   Discard Count: 32 bits\n      Number of packets discarded

    (VoIP)\n   application and the stream repair means is not available, the\n   following
    considerations apply.\n   RTCP XR views a call as being divided into bursts, which
    are periods\n   during which the discard rate is high enough to cause noticeable
    call\n   quality degradation (generally a discard rate over 5 percent) and\n   gaps,
    which are periods during which discarded packets are\n   infrequent, and hence
    call quality is generally acceptable.\n   If voice activity detection is used,
    the burst/gap duration is\n   determined as if silence packets had been sent,
    i.e., a period of\n   silence in excess of Gmin packets will terminate a burst
    condition.\n   The RECOMMENDED value for the threshold Gmin in [RFC3611] results
    in\n   a burst being a period of time during which the call quality is\n   degraded

    so the risk to\n   confidentiality documented in Section 7, paragraph 3 of [RFC3611]\n
    \  does not apply.  However, the gap indicated within this block could\n   be
    used to detect the timing of other events on the path between the\n   sender and
    receiver.  For example, a competing multimedia stream\n   might cause a discard
    burst for the duration of the stream, allowing\n   the receiver of this block
    to know when the competing stream was\n   active.  This risk is not a significant
    threat since the only\n   information leaked is the timing of the discard, not
    the cause.\n   Where this is a concern, the implementation SHOULD apply encryption\n
    \  and authentication to this report block.  For example, this can be\n   achieved
    by using the Audio-Visual Profile with Feedback (AVPF)\n   profile together with

    of those two profiles (\"SAVPF\")\n   is specified in [RFC5124].  Besides this,
    it is believed that this\n   RTCP XR block introduces no new security considerations
    beyond those\n   described in [RFC3611].\n"
