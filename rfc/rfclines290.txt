COMPUTER NETWORKS AND DATE SHARING:
The bibliography is broken into seven subject areas general data structures, data description, data conversion, data management, data security, data transmission, and computer network design.
Two of these areas, general data structures and data management, cover a very broad range of subjects: however, in these two areas, only entries that seem to be specially pertinent to computer networks and data sharing are included.
The bibliography also contains an index of authors.
