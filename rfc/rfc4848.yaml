- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   The purpose of this document is to define a new, straightforward\n\
    \   Dynamic Delegation Discovery Service (DDDS) [7] application to allow\n   mapping\
    \ of domain names to URIs for particular application services\n   and protocols.\
    \  This allows the \"lookup\" of particular services\n   available for given domains,\
    \ for example.\n   Although this is defining a new and separate DDDS Application,\
    \ dubbed\n   U-NAPTR, it is built from the same principles as the Straightforward\n\
    \   NAPTR (S-NAPTR) application, specified in [2].  This specification is\n  \
    \ not an update of S-NAPTR, but the reader is encouraged to review that\n   document\
    \ for extensive coverage of motivation and implementation\n   considerations.\n\
    \   S-NAPTR provides for application service location that does not rely\n   on\
    \ rigid domain naming conventions.  It is deemed \"straightforward\"\n   in part\
    \ because it rules out the use of regular expressions in NAPTR\n   records (for\
    \ the S-NAPTR DDDS Application).  However, that also rules\n   out the possibility\
    \ of providing a URI as the target of DDDS\n   resolution.  A number of applications,\
    \ specified (e.g., [9]) and\n   proposed, find the restriction too limiting, making\
    \ S-NAPTR a near\n   miss to suit their needs.\n   This U-NAPTR is effectively\
    \ a modest extension to S-NAPTR, to\n   accommodate the use of URIs as targets,\
    \ without allowing the full\n   range of possible regular expressions in NAPTR\
    \ records.\n"
- title: 2.  Straightforward URI-Enabled NAPTR (U-NAPTR)
  contents:
  - "2.  Straightforward URI-Enabled NAPTR (U-NAPTR)\n   This document assumes the\
    \ reader is familiar with the S-NAPTR\n   specification [2].  The intention of\
    \ U-NAPTR is to provide everything\n   that S-NAPTR does, except that it allows\
    \ the use of the \"U\" flag in\n   the NAPTR record, and a specific form of REGEXP.\n"
- title: 2.1.  Permitted Flags
  contents:
  - "2.1.  Permitted Flags\n   U-NAPTR permits the same flags as S-NAPTR (\"S\", \"\
    A\", or empty), plus\n   the \"U\" Flag.  For the U-NAPTR DDDS Application, the\
    \ presence of the\n   \"U\" Flag in the NAPTR record indicates the REGEXP field\
    \ must be\n   populated (and, consequently, the REPLACEMENT field is empty). \
    \ The\n   regular expression in the REGEXP field must be of the limited form\n\
    \   described below, and the result of the regular expression evaluation\n   will\
    \ be a URI that is the result of the DDDS resolution.\n"
- title: 2.2.  Permitted Regular Expressions
  contents:
  - "2.2.  Permitted Regular Expressions\n   U-NAPTR permits regular expressions of\
    \ a form that does a complete\n   replacement of the matched string with a URI,\
    \ expressed as a constant\n   string.  This is essentially a dodge around the\
    \ fact that the\n   REPLACEMENT field in NAPTR is required to produce only a fully\n\
    \   qualified domain name (and, therefore, cannot be used for a URI).\n   The\
    \ specific allowed syntax for U-NAPTR regular expressions is:\n        u-naptr-regexp\
    \ = \"!.*!\"<URI>\"!\"\n   where <URI> is as defined in STD 66 [8], the URI syntax\n\
    \   specification.\n   With this limited form of regular expression, applications\
    \ using\n   U-NAPTR need not implement full regular expression parsers.\n"

- title: 4.4.  Flags
  contents:
  - "4.4.  Flags\n   This DDDS Application uses only 3 of the Flags defined for the\
    \ URI/\n   URN Resolution Application [5]: \"S\", \"A\", and \"U\".  No other\
    \ Flags\n   are valid.  If a client obtains a NAPTR RR for a U-NAPTR-using\n \
    \  application that contains any other flag, that NAPTR RR should be\n   ignored\
    \ and processing continues with the next record (if any).\n   These flags are\
    \ for terminal lookups.  This means that the Rule is\n   the last one and that\
    \ the flag determines what the next stage should\n   be.  The \"S\" flag means\
    \ that the output of this Rule is a FQDN for\n   which one or more SRV [3] records\
    \ exist.  \"A\" means that the output\n   of the Rule is a domain name and should\
    \ be used to lookup address\n   records for that domain.  \"U\" means that the\
    \ output of the Rule is a\n   URI that should be resolved in order to obtain access\
    \ to the\n   described service.\n   Consistent with the DDDS algorithm, if the\
    \ Flag string is empty the\n   next lookup is for another NAPTR record (for the\
    \ replacement target).\n"

    \   Note that this is similar to, but not the same as the syntax used in\n   the\
    \ URI DDDS application [5].  The DDDS DNS database requires each\n   DDDS application\
    \ to define the syntax of allowable service strings.\n   The syntax here is expanded\
    \ to allow the characters that are valid in\n   any URI scheme name (see [8]).\
    \  Since \"+\" (the separator used in the\n   RFC3404 service parameter string)\
    \ is an allowed character for URI\n   scheme names, \":\" is chosen as the separator\
    \ here.\n"

- title: 5.  IANA Considerations
  contents:
  - "5.  IANA Considerations\n   This document does not itself place any requirements\
    \ on IANA, but\n   provides the basis upon which U-NAPTR-using services can make\
    \ use of\n   the existing IANA registries for application service tags and\n \
    \  application protocol tags (defined in RFC 3958 [2]).\n   As is the case for\
    \ S-NAPTR, all application service and protocol tags\n   that start with \"x-\"\
    \ are considered experimental, and no provision is\n   made to prevent duplicate\
    \ use of the same string.  Use them at your\n   own risk.\n   All other application\
    \ service and protocol tags are registered based\n   on the \"specification required\"\
    \ option defined in [6], with the\n   further stipulation that the \"specification\"\
    \ is an RFC (of any\n   category).\n   There are no further restrictions placed\
    \ on the tags other than that\n   they must conform with the syntax defined above\
    \ (Section 4.5).\n   The defining RFC must clearly identify and describe, for\
    \ each tag\n   being registered:\n   o  Application protocol or service tag\n\
    \   o  Intended usage\n   o  Interoperability considerations\n   o  Security considerations\
    \ (see Section 6 of this document for\n      further discussion of the types of\
    \ considerations that are\n      applicable)\n   o  Any relevant related publications\n\
    \   The defining RFC may also include further application-specific\n   restrictions,\
    \ such as limitations on the types of URIs that may be\n   returned for the application\
    \ service.\n"
- title: 6.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "6.  Security Considerations\n   U-NAPTR has the same considerations for security\
    \ as S-NAPTR; see\n   Section 8 of [2].  U-NAPTR has the additional consideration\
    \ that\n   resolving URIs (from the result of the DDDS resolution) has its own\n\
    \   set of security implications, covered in the URI specification (in\n   particular,\
    \ Section 7 of [8]).  In essence, using DNSSEC, client\n   software can be confident\
    \ that the URI obtained using U-NAPTR is\n   indeed the one specified by the administrator\
    \ of the domain from\n   which it was retrieved; but the validity of the service\
    \ reached by\n   resolving that URI is a matter of URI resolution security practices.\n"
