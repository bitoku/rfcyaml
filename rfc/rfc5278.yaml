  - "1.  Introduction\n   ENUM (E.164 Number Mapping, RFC 3761 [1]) is a technology\
    \ that\n   transforms E.164 numbers (the International Public Telecommunication\n\
    \   Numbering Plan, ITU-T Recommendation E.164 [2]) into domain names and\n  \
    \ then uses DNS (Domain Name System, RFC 1034 [3]) delegation through\n   NS records\
    \ and Naming Authority Pointer (NAPTR) records (Dynamic\n   Delegation Discovery\
    \ System (DDDS) Part Three: The Domain Name System\n   (DNS) Database, RFC 3403\
    \ [4]) to look up what services are available\n   for a specific domain name.\n\
    \   This document registers Enumservices according to the guidelines\n   given\
    \ in RFC 3761 [1] to be used for provisioning in the services\n   field of a NAPTR\
    \ [4] resource record to indicate the types of\n   functionality associated with\
    \ an end point and/or telephone number.\n   The registration is defined within\
    \ the DDDS (Dynamic Delegation\n   Discovery System [4][5][6][7][8]) hierarchy,\
    \ for use with the \"E2U\"\n   DDDS Application defined in RFC 3761.\n   Voice\
    \ messaging systems are used widely with telephony and voice\n   communication\
    \ services.  The need for a voice messaging service type\n   has become clear\
    \ in order to provide certain applications with direct\n   access to various voice\
    \ messaging services (for example, voicemail),\n   most typically via the use\
    \ of SIP.\n   The authors considered the use of Voice Profile for Internet Mail\n\
    \   (VPIM) [14] but found that VPIM was best suited to the non-real-time\n   and\
    \ non-session-based routing of a voice message once it had been\n   deposited\
    \ into a voice messaging system.  Thus, VPIM was a good\n   solution for the non-real-time\
    \ and non-session-based routing of voice\n   messages between and within domains,\
    \ but it did not enable real-time\n   interaction with a voice messaging system.\n\
    \   Thus, a need has been identified for this voice messaging service\n   type\
    \ that would enable, for example, some of the use cases listed in\n   this section.\n\
    \   Video messaging systems, sometimes called visual voice messaging\n   systems,\
    \ are beginning to be used with real-time communication\n   services.  The need\
    \ for a video messaging service type has become\n   clear in order to provide\
    \ certain applications with direct access to\n   various video messaging services,\
    \ most typically via the use of SIP.\n   Thus, a need has been identified for\
    \ this video messaging service\n   type that would enable, for example, some of\
    \ the use cases listed in\n   this section.\n   Finally, several service providers\
    \ and software developers have\n   indicated that their system for voice messaging\
    \ and video messaging\n   either have been or soon will be unified into a single\
    \ system.  As\n   such, they desired to have the option of using an Enumservice\
    \ type\n   that represents a subscriber's mailbox as being a so-called unified\n\
    \   messaging repository.  Thus, a need has been identified for this\n   unified\
    \ voice and video messaging service type that would enable, for\n   example, some\
    \ of the use cases listed in this section.\n"
- title: 1.1.  Selected Use Cases for Illustrative Purposes
  contents:
  - "1.1.  Selected Use Cases for Illustrative Purposes\n   The following is a partial,\
    \ non-exclusive list of use cases that the\n   vmsg Enumservice could address:\n\
    \   * A called party is busy or does not answer a call.  A client or\n     server\
    \ then determines that a messaging service should be used and\n     sends the\
    \ calling party's session to such a service.  The client or\n     server needs\
    \ to be able to determine which server to direct this\n     real-time session\
    \ to, whether that is within or outside of the\n     called party's domain.\n\
    \   * Similar to the above use case, a real-time session is attempted to\n   \
    \  a messaging system, but that system is currently unavailable.\n     Since multiple\
    \ service type records may be returned by the original\n     ENUM query, the client\
    \ or server could then attempt to initiate a\n     session with one or more backup\
    \ messaging servers in a manner that\n     is transparent to the calling party\
    \ and that supports better\n     overall availability of a messaging service.\n\
    \   * Similar to the above use case, this service type could be used to\n    \
    \ balance load across multiple messaging servers, whether those are\n     in the\
    \ same or in different physical locations.\n   * A user with an account on a messaging\
    \ service needs to connect to\n     the messaging service in order to retrieve\
    \ messages.  They initiate\n     a real-time session, and an ENUM query is performed\
    \ to discover the\n     messaging server that holds its mailbox.\n   * In the\
    \ process of invoking and supporting a real-time, automated\n     and interactive\
    \ session with a user, whether for message deposit or\n     retrieval, VoiceXML\
    \ files are referenced and utilized, via either\n     HTTP or HTTPS.  Multiple\
    \ VoiceXML servers could be associated with\n     a user and returned via ENUM\
    \ query, for the purposes of load\n     balancing, for example.\n"
- title: 1.2.  Consideration of Other Existing Enumservices
  contents:
  - "1.2.  Consideration of Other Existing Enumservices\n   The authors considered\
    \ whether this service type could simply use the\n   SIP Enumservice type [19],\
    \ but found that it does not satisfy their\n   voice messaging requirements, particularly\
    \ given the non-SIP URI sub-\n   types specified herein.  Even with sub-types\
    \ for SIP URIs, however,\n   there are challenges to using the SIP Enumservice\
    \ type.  For example,\n   a request for access to such a service could be extended\
    \ to the\n   requesting SIP client, or User Agent Client (UAC), rather than\n\
    \   relying upon the local policy of a SIP server, or User Agent Server\n   (UAS),\
    \ which means that special routing logic within a UAS cannot be\n   relied upon\
    \ to solve this problem.  More importantly, however, the\n   authors have found\
    \ that without this service type, a UAC or UAS will\n   be presented with multiple\
    \ SIP URIs, with no ability other than in\n   non-standards-based routing rules\
    \ or application logic to recognize\n   which one is related to a voice messaging,\
    \ video messaging, or\n   unified voice and video messaging service.\n"
- title: 2.  Distribution of Data
  contents:
  - "2.  Distribution of Data\n   The authors believe that it is more likely that\
    \ these records will be\n   distributed on a purely private basis, but they may\
    \ also be\n   distributed in public ENUM trees.  Distribution of this NAPTR data\n\
    \   could be either (a) on a private basis within a service provider's\n   internal\
    \ network, (b) on a private basis between one or more parties\n   using a variety\
    \ of security mechanisms to prohibit general public\n   access, or (c) openly\
    \ available.\n"
- title: 3.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "3.  Security Considerations\n   DNS, as used by ENUM, is a global, distributed\
    \ database.  Should\n   implementers of this specification use e164.arpa or any\
    \ other\n   publicly available domain as the tree for maintaining voicemsg\n \
    \  Enumservice data, this information would be visible to anyone\n   anonymously.\
    \  While this is not qualitatively different from\n   publication in a Telephone\
    \ Directory, it does open or ease access to\n   such data without any indication\
    \ that such data has been accessed or\n   by whom it has been accessed.\n   Such\
    \ data harvesting by third parties is often used to generate lists\n   of targets\
    \ for unsolicited information.  Thus, a third party could\n   use this to generate\
    \ a list that it can use to make unsolicited\n   telemarketing phone calls, or\
    \ so-called SPAM over Internet Telephony\n   (SPIT).  Many countries have do-not-call\
    \ registries or other legal or\n   regulatory mechanisms in place to deal with\
    \ such abuses.\n   As noted earlier, carriers, service providers, and other users\
    \ may\n   simply choose not to publish such information in the public e164.arpa\n\
    \   tree, but may instead simply publish this in their internal ENUM\n   routing\
    \ database that is only able to be queried by trusted elements\n   of their network\
    \ and/or partner networks, such as softswitches and\n   SIP proxy servers.  They\
    \ may also choose to publish such information\n   in a carrier-only branch of\
    \ the e164.arpa tree, should one be\n   created.\n   Although an E.164 telephone\
    \ number does not appear to reveal as much\n   identity information about a user\
    \ as a name in the format\n   sip:username@hostname or email:username@hostname,\
    \ the information is\n   still publicly available; thus, there is still the risk\
    \ of unwanted\n   communication.\n   An analysis of threats specific to the dependence\
    \ of ENUM on the DNS\n   and the applicability of DNSSEC [16] to this is provided\
    \ in RFC 3761\n   [1].  A thorough analysis of threats to the DNS itself is covered\
    \ in\n   RFC 3833 [17].\n"

- title: 8.1.  Call Processing When Multiple Records Are Returned
  contents:
  - "8.1.  Call Processing When Multiple Records Are Returned\n   It is likely that\
    \ both E2U+sip and E2U+voicemsg, E2U+videomsg, and/or\n   E2U+unifmsg Enumservice\
    \ type records will be returned for a given\n   query.  In this case, this could\
    \ result in what is essentially\n   E2U+sip records for real-time communications\
    \ with an end user, while,\n   for example, the E2U+voicemsg records will be used\
    \ for real-time\n   communications with a voice messaging service, when the called\
    \ party\n   is not available or does not wish to be disturbed.  Therefore, the\n\
    \   network element that receives the results of this ENUM query will\n   need\
    \ to know enough information in order to select the voicemsg\n   service type,\
    \ rather than the sip service type.\n   In addition, it is likely that multiple\
    \ E2U+voicemsg, E2U+videomsg,\n   and/or E2U+unifmsg Enumservice type records\
    \ will be returned for a\n   given query.  In this case, multiple records may\
    \ include order and\n   preference to allow recursion or load balancing.  Order\
    \ could be used\n   to designate a primary and a backup voice, video, or unified\
    \ voice\n   and video messaging service.  Preference could be used to load\n \
    \  balance across multiple voice, video, and/or unified voice and video\n   messaging\
    \ servers by weight, for example.\n   Finally, as with multiple records resulting\
    \ from a typical ENUM query\n   of the e164.arpa tree, it is up to the application\
    \ using an ENUM\n   resolver to determine which record(s) to use and which record(s)\
    \ to\n   ignore.  Implementers should take this into consideration and build\n\
    \   logic into their applications that can select appropriately from\n   multiple\
    \ records based on business, network, or other rules.\n"
- title: 8.2.  NAPTR Configuration Issues
  contents:
  - "8.2.  NAPTR Configuration Issues\n   Implementers may wish to consider using\
