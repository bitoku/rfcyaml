  contents:
  - "Abstract\n   The Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) is the protocol almost exclusively\n\
    \   used in the Internet to exchange routing information between network\n   domains.\
    \  Due to this central nature, it is important to understand\n   the security\
    \ measures that can and should be deployed to prevent\n   accidental or intentional\
    \ routing disturbances.\n   This document describes measures to protect the BGP\
    \ sessions itself\n   such as Time to Live (TTL), the TCP Authentication Option\
    \ (TCP-AO),\n   and control-plane filtering.  It also describes measures to better\n\
    \   control the flow of routing information, using prefix filtering and\n   automation\
    \ of prefix filters, max-prefix filtering, Autonomous System\n   (AS) path filtering,\
    \ route flap dampening, and BGP community\n   scrubbing.\n"

- title: 4.  Protection of the BGP Speaker
  contents:
  - "4.  Protection of the BGP Speaker\n   The BGP speaker needs to be protected from\
    \ attempts to subvert the\n   BGP session.  This protection SHOULD be achieved\
    \ by an Access Control\n   List (ACL) that would discard all packets directed\
    \ to TCP port 179 on\n   the local device and sourced from an address not known\
    \ or permitted\n   to become a BGP neighbor.  Experience has shown that the natural\n\
    \   protection TCP should offer is not always sufficient, as it is\n   sometimes\
    \ run in control-plane software.  In the absence of ACLs, it\n   is possible to\
    \ attack a BGP speaker by simply sending a high volume\n   of connection requests\
    \ to it.\n   If supported, an ACL specific to the control plane of the router\n\
    \   SHOULD be used (receive-ACL, control-plane policing, etc.), to avoid\n   configuration\
    \ of data-plane filters for packets transiting through\n   the router (and therefore\
    \ not reaching the control plane).  If the\n   hardware cannot do that, interface\
    \ ACLs can be used to block packets\n   addressed to the local router.\n   Some\
    \ routers automatically program such an ACL upon BGP\n   configuration.  On other\
    \ devices, this ACL should be configured and\n   maintained manually or using\
    \ scripts.\n   In addition to strict filtering, rate-limiting MAY be configured\
    \ for\n   accepted BGP traffic.  Rate-limiting BGP traffic consists in\n   permitting\
    \ only a certain quantity of bits per second (or packets per\n   second) of BGP\
    \ traffic to the control plane.  This protects the BGP\n   router control plane\
    \ in case the amount of BGP traffic surpasses\n   platform capabilities.\n   Filtering\
    \ and rate-limiting of control-plane traffic is a wider topic\n   than \"just\
    \ for BGP\".  (If a network administrator brings down a\n   router by overloading\
    \ one of the other protocols remotely, BGP is\n   harmed as well.)  For a more\
    \ detailed recommendation on how to\n   protect the router's control plane, see\
    \ RFC 6192 [11].\n"
- title: 5.  Protection of BGP Sessions
  contents:
  - "5.  Protection of BGP Sessions\n   Current security issues of TCP-based protocols\
    \ (therefore including\n   BGP) have been documented in RFC 6952 [14].  The following\n\
    \   subsections list the major points raised in this RFC and give the\n   best\
    \ practices related to TCP session protection for BGP operation.\n"
- title: 5.1.  Protection of TCP Sessions Used by BGP
  contents:
  - "5.1.  Protection of TCP Sessions Used by BGP\n   Attacks on TCP sessions used\
    \ by BGP (aka BGP sessions), for example,\n   sending spoofed TCP RST packets,\
    \ could bring down a BGP peering.\n   Following a successful ARP spoofing attack\
    \ (or other similar man-in-\n   the-middle attack), the attacker might even be\
    \ able to inject packets\n   into the TCP stream (routing attacks).\n   BGP sessions\
    \ can be secured with a variety of mechanisms.  MD5\n   protection of the TCP\
    \ session header, described in RFC 2385 [7], was\n   the first such mechanism.\
    \  It has been obsoleted by the TCP\n   Authentication Option (TCP-AO; RFC 5925\
    \ [4]), which offers stronger\n   protection.  While MD5 is still the most used\
    \ mechanism due to its\n   availability in vendors' equipment, TCP-AO SHOULD be\
    \ preferred when\n   implemented.\n   IPsec could also be used for session protection.\
    \  At the time of\n   publication, there is not enough experience of the impact\
    \ of using\n   IPsec for BGP peerings, and further analysis is required to define\n\
    \   guidelines.\n   The drawback of TCP session protection is additional configuration\n\
    \   and management overhead for the maintenance of authentication\n   information\
    \ (for example, MD5 passwords).  Protection of TCP sessions\n   used by BGP is\
    \ thus NOT REQUIRED even when peerings are established\n   over shared networks\
    \ where spoofing can be done (like IXPs), but\n   operators are RECOMMENDED to\
    \ consider the trade-offs and to apply TCP\n   session protection where appropriate.\n\
    \   Furthermore, network administrators SHOULD block spoofed packets\n   (packets\
    \ with a source IP address belonging to their IP address\n   space) at all edges\
    \ of their network (see RFC 2827 [8] and RFC 3704\n   [9]).  This protects the\
    \ TCP session used by Internal BGP (IBGP) from\n   attackers outside the Autonomous\
    \ System.\n"
- title: 5.2.  BGP TTL Security (GTSM)
  contents:
  - "5.2.  BGP TTL Security (GTSM)\n   BGP sessions can be made harder to spoof with\
    \ the Generalized TTL\n   Security Mechanisms (GTSM aka TTL security), defined\
    \ in RFC 5082 [3].\n   Instead of sending TCP packets with TTL value of 1, the\
    \ BGP speakers\n   send the TCP packets with TTL value of 255, and the receiver\
    \ checks\n   that the TTL value equals 255.  Since it's impossible to send an\
    \ IP\n   packet with TTL of 255 to an IP host that is not directly connected,\n\
    \   BGP TTL security effectively prevents all spoofing attacks coming\n   from\
    \ third parties not directly connected to the same subnet as the\n   BGP-speaking\
    \ routers.  Network administrators SHOULD implement TTL\n   security on directly\
    \ connected BGP peerings.\n   GTSM could also be applied to multi-hop BGP peering\
    \ as well.  To\n   achieve this, TTL needs to be configured with a proper value\n\
    \   depending on the distance between BGP speakers (using the principle\n   described\
    \ above).  Nevertheless, it is not as effective because\n   anyone inside the\
    \ TTL diameter could spoof the TTL.\n   Like MD5 protection, TTL security has\
    \ to be configured on both ends\n   of a BGP session.\n"
- title: 6.  Prefix Filtering
  contents:
  - "6.  Prefix Filtering\n   The main aspect of securing BGP resides in controlling\
    \ the prefixes\n   that are received and advertised on the BGP peerings.  Prefixes\n\
    \   exchanged between BGP peers are controlled with inbound and outbound\n   filters\
    \ that can match on IP prefixes (as described in this section),\n   AS paths (as\
    \ described in Section 9) or any other attributes of a BGP\n   prefix (for example,\
    \ BGP communities, as described in Section 11).\n"

    \ accept routing\n   table prefixes that are not allocated by IANA and/or RIRs.\
    \  This\n   section details the options for building a list of allocated prefixes\n\
    \   at every level.  It is important to understand that filtering\n   unallocated\
    \ prefixes requires constant updates, as prefixes are\n   continually allocated.\
    \  Therefore, automation of such prefix filters\n   is key for the success of\
    \ this approach.  Network administrators\n   SHOULD NOT consider solutions described\
    \ in this section if they are\n   not capable of maintaining updated prefix filters:\
    \ the damage would\n   probably be worse than the intended security policy.\n"
- title: 6.1.2.1.  IANA-Allocated Prefix Filters
  contents:
  - "6.1.2.1.  IANA-Allocated Prefix Filters\n   IANA has allocated all the IPv4 available\
    \ space.  Therefore, there is\n   no reason why network administrators would keep\
    \ checking that\n   prefixes they receive from BGP peers are in the IANA-allocated\
    \ IPv4\n   address space [25].  No specific filters need to be put in place by\n\
    \   administrators who want to make sure that IPv4 prefixes they receive\n   in\
    \ BGP updates have been allocated by IANA.\n   For IPv6, given the size of the\
    \ address space, it can be seen as wise\n   to accept only prefixes derived from\
    \ those allocated by IANA.\n   Administrators can dynamically build this list\
    \ from the IANA-\n   allocated IPv6 space [26].  As IANA keeps allocating prefixes\
    \ to\n   RIRs, the aforementioned list should be checked regularly against\n \
    \  changes, and if they occur, prefix filters should be computed and\n   pushed\
    \ on network devices.  The list could also be pulled directly by\n   routers when\
    \ they implement such mechanisms.  As there is delay\n   between the time a RIR\
    \ receives a new prefix and the moment it starts\n   allocating portions of it\
    \ to its LIRs, there is no need for doing\n   this step quickly and frequently.\
    \  However, network administrators\n   SHOULD ensure that all IPv6 prefix filters\
    \ are updated within a\n   maximum of one month after any change in the list of\
    \ IPv6 prefixes\n   allocated by IANA.\n   If the process in place (whether manual\
    \ or automatic) cannot\n   guarantee that the list is updated regularly, then\
    \ it's better not to\n   configure any filters based on allocated networks.  The\
    \ IPv4\n   experience has shown that many network operators implemented filters\n\
    \   for prefixes not allocated by IANA but did not update them on a\n   regular\
    \ basis.  This created problems for the latest allocations, and\n   required extra\
    \ work for RIRs that had to \"de-bogonize\" the newly\n   allocated prefixes.\

    \  They are described in the following\n   subsections.\n"
- title: 6.1.2.2.1.  Prefix Filters Created from Internet Routing Registries
  contents:
  - "6.1.2.2.1.  Prefix Filters Created from Internet Routing Registries\n       \
    \     (IRRs)\n   An Internet Routing Registry (IRR) is a database containing Internet\n\
    \   routing information, described using Routing Policy Specification\n   Language\
    \ objects as described in RFC 4012 [10].  Network\n   administrators are given\
    \ privileges to describe routing policies of\n   their own networks in the IRR,\
    \ and that information is published,\n   usually publicly.  A majority of Regional\
    \ Internet Registries do also\n   operate an IRR and can control whether registered\
    \ routes conform to\n   the prefixes that are allocated or directly assigned.\
    \  However, it\n   should be noted that the list of such prefixes is not necessarily\
    \ a\n   complete list, and as such the list of routes in an IRR is not the\n \
    \  same as the set of RIR-allocated prefixes.\n   It is possible to use the IRR\
    \ information to build, for a given\n   neighbor AS, a list of originated or transited\
    \ prefixes that one may\n   accept.  This can be done relatively easily using\
    \ scripts and\n   existing tools capable of retrieving this information from the\n\
    \   registries.  This approach is exactly the same for both IPv4 and\n   IPv6.\n\
    \   The macro-algorithm for the script is as follows.  For the peer that\n   is\
    \ considered, the distant network administrator has provided the AS\n   and may\
    \ be able to provide an AS-SET object (aka AS-MACRO).  An\n   AS-SET is an object\
    \ that contains AS numbers or other AS-SETs.  An\n   operator may create an AS-SET\
    \ defining all the AS numbers of its\n   customers.  A Tier 1 transit provider\
    \ might create an AS-SET\n   describing the AS-SET of connected operators, which\
    \ in turn describe\n   the AS numbers of their customers.  Using recursion, it\
    \ is possible\n   to retrieve from an AS-SET the complete list of AS numbers that\
    \ the\n   peer is likely to announce.  For each of these AS numbers, it is also\n\
    \   easy to look in the corresponding IRR for all associated prefixes.\n   With\
    \ these two mechanisms, a script can build, for a given peer, the\n   list of\
    \ allowed prefixes and the AS number from which they should be\n   originated.\
    \  One could decide not use the origin information and only\n   build monolithic\
    \ prefix filters from fetched data.\n   As prefixes, AS numbers, and AS-SETs may\
    \ not all be under the same\n   RIR authority, it is difficult to choose for each\
    \ object the\n   appropriate IRR to poll.  Some IRRs have been created and are\
    \ not\n   restricted to a given region or authoritative RIR.  They allow RIRs\n\
    \   to publish information contained in their IRR in a common place.\n   They\
    \ also make it possible for any subscriber (probably under\n   contract) to publish\
    \ information too.  When doing requests inside\n   such an IRR, it is possible\
    \ to specify the source of information in\n   order to have the most reliable\
    \ data.  One could check a popular IRR\n   containing many sources (such as RADb\
    \ [27], the Routing Assets\n   Database) and only select as sources some desired\
    \ RIRs and trusted\n   major ISPs (Internet Service Providers).\n   As objects\
    \ in IRRs may frequently vary over time, it is important\n   that prefix filters\
    \ computed using this mechanism are refreshed\n   regularly.  Refreshing the filters\
    \ on a daily basis SHOULD be\n   considered because routing changes must sometimes\
    \ be done in an\n   emergency and registries may be updated at the very last moment.\n\
    \   Note that this approach significantly increases the complexity of the\n  \

- title: 6.1.2.2.2.  SIDR - Secure Inter-Domain Routing
  contents:
  - "6.1.2.2.2.  SIDR - Secure Inter-Domain Routing\n   An infrastructure called SIDR\
    \ (Secure Inter-Domain Routing),\n   described in RFC 6480 [12], has been designed\
    \ to secure Internet\n   advertisements.  At the time of writing this document,\
    \ many documents\n   have been published and a framework with a complete set of\
    \ protocols\n   is proposed so that advertisements can be checked against signed\n\
    \   routing objects in RIRs.  There are basically two services that SIDR\n   offers:\n\
    \   o  Origin validation, described in RFC 6811 [5], seeks to make sure\n    \
    \  that attributes associated with routes are correct.  (The major\n      point\
    \ is the validation of the AS number originating a given\n      route.)  Origin\
    \ validation is now operational (Internet\n      registries, protocols, implementations\
    \ on some routers), and in\n      theory it can be implemented knowing that the\
    \ number of signed\n      resources is still low at the time of writing this document.\n\
    \   o  Path validation provided by BGPsec [29] seeks to make sure that no\n  \
    \    one announces fake/wrong BGP paths that would attract traffic for\n     \
    \ a given destination; see RFC 7132 [16].  BGPsec is still an\n      ongoing work\
    \ item at the time of writing this document and\n      therefore cannot be implemented.\n\
    \   Implementing SIDR mechanisms is expected to solve many of the BGP\n   routing\
    \ security problems in the long term, but it may take time for\n   deployments\
    \ to be made and objects to become signed.  Also, note that\n   the SIDR infrastructure\
    \ is complementing (not replacing) the security\n   best practices listed in this\
    \ document.  Therefore, network\n   administrators SHOULD implement any SIDR proposed\
    \ mechanism (for\n   example, route origin validation) on top of the other existing\n\
    \   mechanisms even if they could sometimes appear to be targeting the\n   same\
    \ goal.\n   If route origin validation is implemented, the reader SHOULD refer\
    \ to\n   the rules described in RFC 7115 [15].  In short, each external route\n\
    \   received on a router SHOULD be checked against the Resource Public\n   Key\
    \ Infrastructure (RPKI) data set:\n   o  If a corresponding ROA (Route Origin\
    \ Authorization) is found and\n      is valid, then the prefix SHOULD be accepted.\n\
    \   o  If the ROA is found and is INVALID, then the prefix SHOULD be\n      discarded.\n\
    \   o  If a ROA is not found, then the prefix SHOULD be accepted, but the\n  \
    \    corresponding route SHOULD be given a low preference.\n   In addition to\
    \ this, network administrators SHOULD sign their routing\n   objects so their\
    \ routes can be validated by other networks running\n   origin validation.\n \
    \  One should understand that the RPKI model brings new, interesting\n   challenges.\
    \  The paper \"On the Risk of Misbehaving RPKI Authorities\"\n   [31] explains\
    \ how the RPKI model can impact the Internet if\n   authorities don't behave as\
    \ they are supposed to.  Further analysis\n   is certainly required on RPKI, which\
    \ carries part of BGP security.\n"

    \ 2-byte or 4-byte AS paths that\n      must not be accepted if advertised by\
    \ the customer, such as\n      upstream transit providers or peer ASNs.\n   o\
    \  Network administrators SHOULD NOT accept prefixes with private AS\n      numbers\

    \ administrators SHOULD NOT accept prefixes when the first\n      AS number in\
    \ the AS path is not the one of the peer's unless the\n      peering is done toward\
    \ a BGP route server [17] (for example, on an\n      IXP) with transparent AS\
    \ path handling.  In that case, this\n      verification needs to be deactivated,\
    \ as the first AS number will\n      be the one of an IXP member, whereas the\
    \ peer AS number will be\n      the one of the BGP route server.\n   o  Network\
    \ administrators SHOULD NOT advertise prefixes with a\n      nonempty AS path\
    \ unless they intend to provide transit for these\n      prefixes.\n   o  Network\
    \ administrators SHOULD NOT advertise prefixes with upstream\n      AS numbers\
    \ in the AS path to their peering AS unless they intend\n      to provide transit\
    \ for these prefixes.\n   o  Private AS numbers are conventionally used in contexts\

    \ peers\n      that are not party to such private arrangements, and they SHOULD\n\
    \      be stripped when received from BGP peers that are not party to\n      such\

    \ is common, and mechanisms exist to allow\n   smooth ASN migration [28].  The\
    \ usual migration technique, local to a\n   router, consists in modifying the\
    \ AS path so it is presented to a\n   peer with the previous ASN, as if no renumbering\
    \ was done.  This\n   makes it possible to change the ASN of a router without\
    \ reconfiguring\n   all EBGP peers at the same time (as that operation would require\n\
    \   synchronization with all peers attached to that router).  During this\n  \
    \ renumbering operation, the rules described above may be adjusted.\n"
- title: 10.  Next-Hop Filtering
  contents:
  - "10.  Next-Hop Filtering\n   If peering on a shared network, like an IXP, BGP\
    \ can advertise\n   prefixes with a third-party next hop, thus directing packets\
    \ not to\n   the peer announcing the prefix but somewhere else.\n   This is a\
    \ desirable property for BGP route-server setups [17], where\n   the route server\
    \ will relay routing information but has neither the\n   capacity nor the desire\
    \ to receive the actual data packets.  So, the\n   BGP route server will announce\
    \ prefixes with a next-hop setting\n   pointing to the router that originally\
    \ announced the prefix to the\n   route server.\n   In direct peerings between\
    \ ISPs, this is undesirable, as one of the\n   peers could trick the other one\
    \ into sending packets into a black\n   hole (unreachable next hop) or to an unsuspecting\
    \ third party who\n   would then have to carry the traffic.  Especially for black-holing,\n\
    \   the root cause of the problem is hard to see without inspecting BGP\n   prefixes\
    \ at the receiving router of the IXP.\n   Therefore, an inbound route policy SHOULD\
    \ be applied on IXP peerings\n   in order to set the next hop for accepted prefixes\
    \ to the BGP peer IP\n   address (belonging to the IXP LAN) that sent the prefix\
    \ (which is\n   what \"next-hop-self\" would enforce on the sending side).\n \
    \  This policy SHOULD NOT be used on route-server peerings or on\n   peerings\
    \ where network administrators intentionally permit the other\n   side to send\
    \ third-party next hops.\n   This policy also SHOULD be adjusted if the best practice\
    \ of Remote\n   Triggered Black Holing (aka RTBH as described in RFC 6666 [13])\
    \ is\n   implemented.  In that case, network administrators would apply a\n  \
    \ well-known BGP next hop for routes they want to filter (if an\n   Internet threat\
    \ is observed from/to this route, for example).  This\n   well-known next hop\
    \ will be statically routed to a null interface.\n   In combination with a unicast\
    \ RPF check, this will discard traffic\n   from and toward this prefix.  Peers\
    \ can exchange information about\n   black holes using, for example, particular\
    \ BGP communities.  Network\n   administrators could propagate black-hole information\
    \ to their peers\n   using an agreed-upon BGP community: when receiving a route\
    \ with that\n   community, a configured policy could change the next hop in order\
    \ to\n   create the black hole.\n"
- title: 11.  BGP Community Scrubbing
  contents:
  - "11.  BGP Community Scrubbing\n   Optionally, we can consider the following rules\
    \ on BGP AS paths:\n   o  Network administrators SHOULD scrub inbound communities\
    \ with their\n      number in the high-order bits, and allow only those communities\n\
    \      that customers/peers can use as a signaling mechanism\n   o  Networks administrators\
    \ SHOULD NOT remove other communities\n      applied on received routes (communities\
    \ not removed after\n      application of the previous statement).  In particular,\
    \ they\n      SHOULD keep original communities when they apply a community.\n\
    \      Customers might need them to communicate with upstream providers.\n   \
    \   In particular, network administrators SHOULD NOT (generally)\n      remove\
    \ the no-export community, as it is usually announced by\n      their peer for\
    \ a certain purpose.\n"

  - "Appendix A.  IXP LAN Prefix Filtering - Example\n   An IXP in the RIPE region\
    \ is allocated an IPv4 /22 prefix by RIPE NCC\n   (X.Y.0.0/22 in this example)\
    \ and uses a /23 of this /22 for the IXP\n   LAN (let say X.Y.0.0/23).  This IXP\
    \ LAN prefix is the one used by IXP\n   members to configure EBGP peerings.  The\
    \ IXP could also be allocated\n   an AS number (AS64496 in our example).\n   Any\
    \ IXP member SHOULD make sure it filters prefixes more specific\n   than X.Y.0.0/23\
    \ from all its EBGP peers.  If it received X.Y.0.0/24\n   or X.Y.1.0/24 this could\
    \ seriously impact its routing.\n   The IXP SHOULD originate X.Y.0.0/22 and advertise\
    \ it to its members\n   through an EBGP peering (most likely from its BGP route\
    \ servers,\n   configured with AS64496).\n   The IXP members SHOULD accept the\

    \   IXP members SHOULD then advertise X.Y.0.0/22 prefix to their\n   downstreams.\
    \  This announce would pass IRR based filters as it is\n   originated by the IXP.\n"
