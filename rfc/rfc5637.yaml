  - "Abstract\n   In commercial and enterprise deployments, Mobile IPv6 can be a\n\

    \  Integrating the Authentication, Authorization, and\n   Accounting (AAA) infrastructure\
    \ (e.g., Network Access Server and AAA\n   server) also offers a solution component\
    \ for Mobile IPv6\n   bootstrapping.  This document describes various scenarios\
    \ where a AAA\n   interface for Mobile IPv6 is required.  Additionally, it lists\
    \ design\n   goals and requirements for such an interface.\n"

  - "1.  Introduction\n   Mobile IPv6 [1] provides the basic IP mobility functionality\
    \ for\n   IPv6.  When Mobile IPv6 is used in tightly managed environments with\n\
    \   the use of the AAA (Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting)\n   infrastructure,\
    \ an interface between Mobile IPv6 and AAA protocols\n   needs to be defined.\
    \  Also, two scenarios for bootstrapping Mobile\n   IPv6 service [2], i.e., split\
    \ [3] and integrated [6] scenarios,\n   require the specification of a message\
    \ exchange between the Home\n   Agent (HA) and AAA infrastructure for authentication\
    \ and\n   authorization purposes and a message exchange between the AAA server\n\
    \   and the NAS in order to provide the visited network with the\n   necessary\
    \ configuration information (e.g., Home Agent address).\n   This document describes\
    \ various scenarios where a AAA interface is\n   required.  Additionally, it lists\
    \ design goals and requirements for\n   the communication between the HA and the\
    \ AAA server and between the\n   NAS and the AAA server needed in the split and\
    \ integrated scenarios.\n   Requirements are listed in case either IPsec or RFC\
    \ 4285 [4] is used\n   for Mobile IPv6 authentication.\n   This document only\
    \ describes requirements, goals, and scenarios.  It\n   does not provide solutions.\n\
    \   Notice that this document builds on the security model of the AAA\n   infrastructure.\
    \  As such, the end host/user shares credentials with\n   the home AAA server\
    \ and the communication between the AAA server and\n   the AAA client may be protected.\
    \  If the AAA server and the AAA\n   client are not part of the same administrative\
    \ domain, then some sort\n   of contractual relationship between the involved\
    \ administrative\n   domains is typically in place in the form of roaming agreements.\n"
- title: 2.  Terminology
  contents:
  - "2.  Terminology\n   The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\"\
    , \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and\
    \ \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC\
    \ 2119 [5], with the\n   qualification that, unless otherwise stated, these words\
    \ apply to the\n   design of the AAA protocol extension, not its implementation\
    \ or its\n   usage.\n   The following terms are extracted from [2].\n   o  Access\
    \ Service Authorizer (ASA).  A network operator that\n      authenticates a Mobile\
    \ Node and establishes the Mobile Node's\n      authorization to receive Internet\
    \ service.\n   o  Access Service Provider (ASP).  A network operator that provides\n\
    \      direct IP packet forwarding to and from the end host.\n   o  Mobility Service\
    \ Authorizer (MSA).  A service provider that\n      authorizes Mobile IPv6 service.\n\
    \   o  Mobility Service Provider (MSP).  A service provider that provides\n  \
    \    Mobile IPv6 service.  In order to obtain such service, the Mobile\n     \
    \ Node must be authenticated and prove authorization to obtain the\n      service.\n"
- title: 3.  Motivation
  contents:
  - "3.  Motivation\n   Mobile IPv6 specification [1] requires that Mobile Nodes (MNs)\
    \ are\n   provisioned with a set of configuration parameters -- namely, the\n\
    \   Home Address and the Home Agent Address, in order to accomplish a\n   home\
    \ registration.  Moreover, MNs and Home Agents (HAs) must share\n   the cryptographic\
    \ material needed in order to set up IPsec security\n   associations to protect\
    \ Mobile IPv6 signaling (e.g., shared keys or\n   certificates).  This is referred\
    \ as the bootstrapping problem: as\n   described in [2], the AAA infrastructure\
    \ can be used as the central\n   element to enable dynamic Mobile IPv6 bootstrapping.\
    \  In this case,\n   the AAA infrastructure can be exploited to offload the end\
    \ host's\n   authentication to the AAA server as well as to deliver the necessary\n\
    \   configuration parameters to the visited network (e.g., Home Agent\n   address\
    \ as specified in [6]).\n   Moreover, in case Mobile IPv6 is a service offered\
    \ by a Mobility\n   Service Provider (MSP), all protocol operations (e.g., home\n\
    \   registrations) may need to be explicitly authorized and monitored\n   (e.g.,\
    \ for accounting purposes).  This can be accomplished relying on\n   the AAA infrastructure\
    \ of the Mobility Service Authorizer (MSA) that\n   stores user profiles and credentials.\n"
- title: 4.  Bootstrapping Scenarios
  contents:
  - "4.  Bootstrapping Scenarios\n   This section describes some bootstrapping scenarios\
    \ in which\n   communication between the AAA infrastructure of the Mobility Service\n\
    \   Provider and the Home Agent is needed.  The need of MIPv6-aware\n   communication\
    \ between the AAA server and the Network Access Server\n   (NAS) is also described.\
    \  The purpose of this section is only to\n   explain the situation where bootstrapping\
    \ is required.  The actual\n   mechanisms and additional details are specified\
    \ elsewhere or are left\n   for future work (see, e.g., [2], [3], and [6]).\n"
- title: 4.1.  Split Scenario
  contents:
  - "4.1.  Split Scenario\n   In the split scenario [3], there is the assumption that\
    \ the mobility\n   service and network access service are not provided by the\
    \ same\n   administrative entity.  This implies that the mobility service is\n\
    \   authorized by the MSA that is a different entity from the ASA.\n   In this\
    \ scenario, the Mobile Node discovers the Home Agent Address\n   using the Domain\
    \ Name Service (DNS).  It queries the address based on\n   the Home Agent name\
    \ or by service name.  In the former case, the\n   Mobile Node is configured with\
    \ the Fully Qualified Domain Name (FDQN)\n   of the Home Agent.  In the latter\
    \ case, [3] defines a new service\n   resource record (SRV RR).\n   Then the Mobile\
    \ Node performs an IKEv2 [7] exchange with the HA to\n   set up IPsec Security\
    \ Associations (SAs) to protect Mobile IPv6\n   signaling and to configure its\
    \ Home Address (HoA).  Mutual\n   authentication for IKEv2 between Mobile Node\
    \ and Home Agent can be\n   done with or without use of the Extensible Authentication\
    \ Protocol\n   (EAP).\n   If EAP is used for authentication, the operator can\
    \ choose any\n   available EAP methods.  Use of EAP with the AAA infrastructure\
    \ allows\n   the HA to check the validity of each MN's credentials with the AAA\n\
    \   infrastructure, rather than having to maintain credentials for each\n   MN\
    \ itself.  It also allows roaming in terms of Mobile IPv6 service\n   where the\
    \ MSP and MSA belong to different administrative domains.  In\n   this case, the\
    \ HA in the MSP can check the validity of the\n   credentials provided by the\
    \ MN with the AAA infrastructure of MSA,\n   receiving the relevant authorization\
    \ information.\n   The Mobile Node may also want to update its FQDN in the DNS\
    \ with the\n   newly allocated Home Address. [3] recommends that the HA performs\
    \ the\n   DNS entry update on behalf of the Mobile Node.  For that purpose, the\n\
    \   Mobile Node indicates its FDQN in the IKEv2 exchange (in the IDi\n   field\
    \ in IKE_AUTH) and adds a DNS Update Option in the Binding Update\n   message\
    \ sent to the HA.\n   When the Mobile Node uses a Home Agent belonging to a different\n\
    \   administrative domain (MSP != MSA), the local HA may not share a\n   security\
    \ association with the home DNS server.  In this case, [3]\n   suggests that the\
    \ home AAA server is responsible for the update.\n   Thus, the HA should send\
    \ to the home AAA server the (FDQN, HoA) pair.\n"
- title: 4.2.  Integrated Scenario
  contents:
  - "4.2.  Integrated Scenario\n   In the integrated scenario, the assumption is that\
    \ the Access Service\n   Authorizer (ASA) is the same as the Mobility Service\
    \ Authorizer\n   (MSA).  Further details of this type of a scenario are being\
    \ worked\n   on separately [6].\n   The Home Agent can be assigned either in the\
    \ Access Service\n   Provider's network or in the separate network.  In the former\
    \ case,\n   the MSP is the same entity as the ASP, whereas in the latter case\
    \ the\n   MSP and ASP are different entities.\n   In this scenario, the Mobile\
    \ Node discovers the Home Agent Address\n   using DHCPv6.  If the user is authorized\
    \ for Mobile IPv6 service,\n   during the network access authentication the AAAH\
    \ (the AAA server in\n   the home network) sends the information about the assigned\
    \ Home Agent\n   to the NAS where the Mobile Node is currently attached.  To request\n\
    \   Home Agent data, the Mobile Node sends a DHCPv6 Information Request\n   to\
    \ the All_DHCP_Relay_Agents_and_Servers multicast address.  With\n   this request,\
    \ the Mobile Node can specify if it wants a Home Agent\n   provided by the visited\
    \ domain (ASP/MSP) or by the home domain\n   (ASA/MSA).  In both cases, the NAS\
    \ acts a DHCPv6 relay.  When the NAS\n   receives the DHCPv6 Information Request,\
    \ it passes Home Agent\n   information received from the AAAH server to the DHCP\
    \ server, for\n   instance using mechanisms defined in [6].\n   In case the Mobile\
    \ Node cannot acquire Home Agent information via\n   DHCPv6, it can try the default\
    \ mechanism based on DNS described in\n   [3].  After the Mobile Node has acquired\
    \ the Home Agent information,\n   the mechanisms used to bootstrap the HoA, the\
    \ IPsec Security\n   Association, and the authentication and authorization with\
    \ the MSA\n   are the same as described in the bootstrapping solution for the\
    \ split\n   scenario [3].\n"
