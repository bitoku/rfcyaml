  - "1.  Introduction\n   Section 11.5 of [RFC6455] sets up a WebSocket Subprotocol
    Name\n   Registry at IANA and directs IANA to use First Come First Serve\n   registration
    procedures as set out in [RFC5226].  The reuse of this\n   registry by other protocols
    has indicated that some clarification of\n   the instructions to IANA would be
    useful.\n"
  title: 1.  Introduction
- contents:
  - "2.  Clarified Instructions\n   The tokens registered in the WebSocket Subprotocol
    Name Registry\n   created by Section 11.5 of RFC 6455 are matched using case-sensitive\n
    \  string match.  IANA is, however, instructed to decline registrations\n   in
    the registry which differ only as to case, in order to minimize\n   potential
    confusion among different registered versions.  For other\n   useful advice on
    avoiding collision, registrants are encouraged to\n   consult the non-normative
    Section 1.9 of RFC 6455.\n"

    policy, not a protocol.\n"

  - "4.  IANA Considerations\n   This document is, in its entirety, a clarification
    of the registry\n   policy for the WebSocket Subprotocol Name Registry.  As part
    of this\n   clarification, IANA has listed both this document and RFC 6455 as\n
    \  references for the WebSocket Subprotocol Name Registry.  In addition,\n   IANA
    has included the following note under the registry's\n   Registration Procedures:
    \"Please see Section 2 of RFC 7936, which\n   clarifies that registrations which
    differ from existing registrations\n   only by case will be refused.\"\n"
