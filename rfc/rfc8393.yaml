  - "Abstract\n   This document describes a network that supports Service Function\n\
    \   Chaining (SFC) using the Network Service Header (NSH) with no payload\n  \
    \ data and carrying only metadata.  This is achieved by defining a new\n   NSH\
    \ \"Next Protocol\" type value of \"None\".\n   This document illustrates some\

  - "1.  Introduction\n   An architecture for Service Function Chaining (SFC) is presented\
    \ in\n   [RFC7665].  That architecture enables packets to be forwarded along\n\
    \   Service Function Paths (SFPs) to pass through various Service\n   Functions\
    \ (SFs) that act on the packets.  Each packet is encapsulated\n   with a Network\
    \ Service Header (NSH) [RFC8300] that identifies the SFP\n   that the packet travels\
    \ along (by means of a Service Path Identifier\n   -- SPI) and the hop (i.e.,\
    \ the next SF to be executed) along the SFP\n   that the packet has reached (by\
    \ means of a Service Index -- SI).  The\n   SPI and SI are fields encoded in the\
    \ NSH.\n   Packets are classified at the SFC network ingress boundaries by\n \
    \  classifiers (Section 4.4 of [RFC7665]) and have an NSH applied to\n   them.\
    \  Such packets are forwarded between Service Function Forwarders\n   (SFFs) using\
    \ tunnels across the underlay network, and each SFF may\n   hand the packet off\
    \ to one or more Service Function Instances (SFIs)\n   according to the definition\
    \ of the SFP.\n   The SFC classifier or any SFC-aware SFI may wish to share information\n\
    \   (possibly state information) about the SFP, the traffic flow, or a\n   specific\
    \ packet, and they may do this by adding metadata to packets\n   as part of the\
    \ NSH.  Metadata may be used to enhance or enable the\n   function performed by\
    \ SFC-aware SFs, may enable coordination and data\n   exchange between SFIs, or\
    \ may be used to assist a network operator in\n   the diagnosis and monitoring\
    \ of an SFP.  The nature of metadata to be\n   supplied and consumed is implementation-\
    \ and deployment-specific.\n   This document defines a mechanism for metadata\
    \ to be carried on an\n   SFP without the need for payload data.  This mechanism\
    \ enables\n   diagnosis and monitoring of SFPs, and coordination between SFC-aware\n\
    \   SFIs.  The mechanism can be applied without the need for traffic to\n   be\
    \ flowing; if traffic is flowing, it can be applied without the need\n   to insert\
    \ what might be substantial amounts of metadata into data\n   packets (an operation\
    \ that may be costly in some hardware).\n   This document describes how this function\
    \ is achieved through the use\n   of a new value for the NSH \"Next Protocol\"\
    \ field to indicate \"None\".\n   Like any NSH packets, such packets are contained\
    \ within the\n   SFC-enabled domain.\n   This document illustrates some of the\
    \ functions that may be achieved\n   or enhanced by this mechanism, but it does\
    \ not provide an exhaustive\n   list of use cases, nor is it intended to be definitive\
    \ about the\n   functions it describes (see Section 6).\n   This document uses\
    \ the terms defined in [RFC7665] and [RFC8300].\n"

    , \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"\
    NOT RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and\n   \"OPTIONAL\" in this document are to be interpreted\
    \ as described in\n   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear\
    \ in all\n   capitals, as shown here.\n"
- title: 3.  The Network Service Header
  contents:
  - "3.  The Network Service Header\n   The NSH includes a field called \"Next Protocol\"\
    \ that is used to\n   indicate the nature of the payload data that follows the\
    \ NSH.  The\n   field can be used by any component that processes the NSH (for\n\
    \   example, to understand how to interpret and parse the payload) and by\n  \
    \ nodes at the end of the SFP that remove the NSH and forward the\n   payload\
    \ data.\n"
- title: 3.1.  Next Protocol "None"
  contents:
  - "3.1.  Next Protocol \"None\"\n   This document defines a new value (0x00) for\
    \ the \"Next Protocol\"\n   field to indicate that the next protocol is \"None\"\
    , which means that\n   there is no user/payload data following the NSH.\n   When\
    \ the next protocol is \"None\", the rest of the NSH still has\n   meaning; in\
    \ particular, the metadata carried in the NSH may still be\n   present.  It is\
    \ not intended that a packet with next protocol set to\n   \"None\" be sent with\
    \ no metadata (see Section 4).  Thus, an SFC-aware\n   node SHOULD NOT create\
    \ a packet with \"Next Protocol\" set to \"None\",\n   Metadata Type set to 0x2,\
    \ and with an NSH Length of 0x2.\n"
- title: 4.  Processing Rules
  contents:
  - "4.  Processing Rules\n   A packet with no payload data may be inserted at the\
    \ head end of an\n   SFP (such as at a classifier) and may be easily forwarded\
    \ by an SFF\n   or SFI on the SFP using the processing rules defined in [RFC8300].\n\
    \   A packet with no payload may also be generated by an SFC-aware SFI as\n  \
    \ a result of processing an incoming packet (i.e., triggered by a\n   condition\
    \ arising from processing a normal NSH packet with a\n   payload).  In such cases,\
    \ the SPI/SI can be inherited from the\n   original packet or can be set according\
    \ to information supplied in\n   one of three ways:\n   o  through the control\
    \ plane,\n   o  through the management plane, or\n   o  through information carried\
    \ in the metadata of the data packet.\n   This document does not further specify\
    \ the triggers to generate an\n   NSH packet with a \"Next Protocol\" set to \"\
    None\".\n   An SFC-aware node wishing to send metadata without a data packet\n\
    \   (i.e., a node that conforms to this specification):\n   o  MUST create a packet\
    \ carrying an NSH and the desired metadata.\n   o  MUST set the \"Next Protocol\"\
    \ field to 0x00.\n   o  SHOULD ensure that there are no bytes following the end\
    \ of the NSH\n      (i.e., that there is no payload data).\n   o  MUST encapsulate\
    \ and send the packet as normal for tunneling to\n      the next hop on the SFP\
    \ as would be done for any NSH packet (i.e.,\n      for a data packet following\
    \ the SFP).\n   A transit node (SFF, SFI, or classifier) that conforms to this\n\
    \   specification and that receives a packet with \"Next Protocol\"\n   indicating\
    \ \"None\" MUST NOT attempt to parse or process beyond the end\n   of the NSH,\
    \ but it SHOULD process the NSH and the metadata as normal.\n   Processing for\
    \ nodes that do not support \"Next Protocol\" set to\n   \"None\" is described\
    \ in Section 5.  Note, however, that an\n   intermediate node that is instructed\
    \ to strip all metadata from\n   packets will create a packet with an NSH but\
    \ no metadata and no\n   payload.  Such packets SHOULD NOT continue to be forwarded\
    \ along the\n   SFP.\n   A node that is the egress of an SFP would normally strip\
    \ the NSH and\n   forward the payload according to the setting of the \"Next Protocol\"\
    \n   field.  Such nodes MUST NOT forward packets with \"Next Protocol\"\n   indicating\
    \ \"None\" even if there are some bytes after the NSH.\n   In deployments where\
    \ use of next protocol \"None\" is not desired,\n   administrators SHOULD instruct\
    \ SFC-aware nodes to not create such\n   packets and to discard packets with next\
    \ protocol \"None\".\n"
- title: 5.  Backward Compatibility
  contents:
  - "5.  Backward Compatibility\n   SFC-aware nodes that do not understand the meaning\
    \ of a value\n   contained in the \"Next Protocol\" field of the NSH are unable\
    \ to parse\n   the payload.  Such nodes silently drop packets with unknown \"\
    Next\n   Protocol\" values unless explicitly configured to forward them\n   (Section\
    \ 2.2 of [RFC8300]).\n   This means that legacy SFC-aware nodes that are unaware\
    \ of the\n   meaning of the \"Next Protocol\" value \"None\" will act as follows:\n\
    \   o  SFFs can be configured to forward the packets.\n   o  SFC proxies will\
    \ drop the packets.\n   o  SFIs will most likely drop the packets.\n   o  Classifiers\
    \ (i.e., nodes performing reclassification) will most\n      likely drop the packets.\n\
    \   SFC-aware nodes at the end of an SFP possibly forward packets with no\n  \
    \ knowledge of the payload in a \"pop and forward\" form of processing\n   where\
    \ the NSH is removed, the packet is simply put on an interface,\n   and the payload\
    \ protocol is known a priori (or assumed).  It is a\n   general processing rule\
    \ for all packet forwarding engines that they\n   should not attempt to send packets\
    \ with zero length.  Packets with\n   the NSH \"Next Protocol\" field set to \"\
    None\" are expected to have zero\n   payload length and so should not be forwarded\
    \ once the NSH has been\n   stripped.  In any case, as noted in Section 4, SFC-aware\
    \ nodes at the\n   end of an SFP do not forward packets with \"Next Protocol\"\
    \ set to\n   \"None\".\n"

- title: 6.1.  Per-SFP Metadata
  contents:
  - "6.1.  Per-SFP Metadata\n   Per-SFP metadata is metadata that applies to an SFP\
    \ and any data\n   packets on that SFP.  It does not need to be transmitted with\
    \ every\n   packet, but it can be installed at the points of consumption (such\
    \ as\n   at SFIs) and applied to all packets on the SFP as they pass through\n\
    \   this point.  It could be installed by inclusion in the NSH of a data\n   packet\
    \ sent on the SFP by out-of-band control- or management-plane\n   mechanisms,\
    \ or by separate metadata-only packets using \"Next\n   Protocol\" set to \"None\"\
    \ as described in this document.\n   Per-SFP metadata-only packets may be sent\
    \ along the path of an SFP\n   simply by setting the correct SPI in the NSH, and\
    \ setting the SI to\n   the correct value for the hop of the SFP at which the\
    \ metadata is to\n   be introduced.  SFC-aware nodes (e.g., classifiers) will\
    \ know the\n   correct SI values to be used from information supplied by the control\n\
    \   or management plane as is the case for NSH packets with payload data.\n"
- title: 6.2.  Per-Flow Metadata
  contents:
  - "6.2.  Per-Flow Metadata\n   Per-flow metadata is metadata that applies to a subset\
    \ of the packets\n   on an SFP, such as packets matching a particular 5-tuple\
    \ of source\n   address, destination address, source port, destination port, and\n\
    \   payload protocol.  Also, this metadata does not need to be\n   transmitted\
    \ with every packet, but it can be installed at the SFIs on\n   the SFP and applied\
    \ to the packets that match the flow description.\n   If there is just one flow\
    \ on an SFP, then there is no difference\n   between per-flow metadata and per-SFP\
    \ metadata as described in\n   Section 6.1.\n   In normal processing, the flow\
    \ to which per-flow metadata applies can\n   be deduced by looking at the payload\
    \ data in the context of the value\n   of the \"Next Protocol\" field.  However,\
    \ when \"Next Protocol\"\n   indicates \"None\", this cannot be done.  In this\
    \ case, the identity of\n   the flow is carried in the metadata itself.\n"
- title: 6.3.  Coordination between SFC-Aware SFIs
  contents:
  - "6.3.  Coordination between SFC-Aware SFIs\n   A pair of SFC-aware SFIs (adjacent\
    \ or not) on an SFP may desire to\n   coordinate state and may do this by sending\
    \ information encoded in\n   metadata.\n   To do this using the mechanisms defined\
    \ in this document:\n   o  There must be an SFP that passes through the two SFIs\
    \ in the\n      direction of sender to receiver.\n   o  The sender must know the\
    \ correct SPI to use.\n   o  The sender must know the correct SI to use for the\
    \ point at which\n      it resides on the SFP.\n   o  Ideally, the receiver will\
    \ know to remove the packet from the SFP\n      and not forward it further as\
    \ this might share metadata wider than\n      desirable and would cause unnecessary\
    \ packets in the network.\n      Note, however, that continued forwarding of such\
    \ packets would not\n      be substantially harmful in its own right.\n   Note\
    \ that technically (according to the SFC architecture) the process\n   of inserting\
    \ a packet into an SFP is performed by a classifier.\n   However, a classifier\
    \ may be co-resident with an SFI so that an\n   implementation of an SF may also\
    \ be able to generate NSH packets as\n   described in this document.\n   Note\
    \ also that a system with SFIs that need to coordinate between\n   each other\
    \ may be configured so that there is a specific, dedicated\n   SFP between those\
    \ service functions that is used solely for this\n   purpose.  Thus, such an SFI\
    \ does not need to insert NSH packets onto\n   SFPs used to carry payload data,\
    \ but it can use (and know the SPI of)\n   this special, dedicated SFP.\n"

    \ in [SFC-OAM-FRAME].  The NSH definition in\n   [RFC8300] includes an O bit that\

    \ is carried in packets that also include payload\n   data, that information might\
    \ be carried between the NSH and the\n   payload.  Therefore, the mechanism defined\

  contents:
  - "6.5.  Control-Plane and Management-Plane Uses\n   As described in Section 6.3,\
    \ SFPs can be established specifically to\n   carry metadata-only packets.  And\
    \ as described in Section 6.1,\n   metadata-only packets can be sent down existing\
    \ SFPs.  This means\n   that metadata-only packets can be used to carry control-plane\

    \   In effect, SFPs can be established to serve as a Data Control Network\n  \

    \ are out of scope for this document, but it should be\n   understood that, just\
    \ as for OAM, an essential feature of using a\n   control channel is that the\
    \ various speakers are assigned identifiers\n   (i.e., addresses).  In this case,\

    \ described in this document are not applicable to per-\n   packet metadata because,\
    \ by definition, if the \"Next Protocol\"\n   indicates \"None\", then there is\
    \ no packet following the NSH for the\n   metadata to be associated with.\n"
- title: 7.  Management and Congestion Control Considerations
  contents:
  - "7.  Management and Congestion Control Considerations\n   The mechanisms described\
    \ in this document allow SFC-aware nodes in an\n   SFC network to generate additional\
    \ packets.  These are not intended\n   to be sent frequently for any flow, but\
    \ there is still a risk that\n   they might flood the network.  For example, if\
    \ an attempt is made to\n   use this mechanism for \"per-packet metadata\" (see\
    \ Section 6.6) then\n   this might double the number of packets in the network.\
    \  Similarly,\n   if this mechanism is used for a form of aliveness detection\
    \ OAM that\n   requires very frequent test messages, then the number of additional\n\
    \   messages may be very high.  Such additional messages risk causing\n   congestion\
    \ in the network.\n   The underlay network (that is, the tunnels across the underlay\n\
    \   between SFC nodes) will not distinguish between data-carrying packets\n  \
    \ and those packets with \"Next Protocol\" set to \"None\".  All packets\n   will\
    \ be treated the same and will need to fall within the\n   capabilities of the\
    \ underlay network to process and forward packets.\n   Nodes in the SFC overlay\
    \ network will need to perform special\n   processing on the additional packets\
    \ according to their roles and\n   according to the application for the metadata.\
    \  For example, an SFF\n   will likely only have to forward per-SFP metadata,\
    \ while an SF will\n   need to extract it and process it as it would if the metadata\
    \ was\n   carried in a packet with user data.  On the other hand, metadata\n \
    \  might also be used to cause actions at all nodes (see Sections 6.3,\n   6.4,\
    \ and 6.5) and could increase the processing load.\n   In view of these potential\
    \ issues, all implementations SHOULD\n   implement rate limits on the generation\
    \ of per-SFP packets with \"Next\n   Protocol\" set to \"None\".  Furthermore,\
    \ these rate limits SHOULD be\n   configurable and applied per SFP and per application\
    \ so that one\n   application on one SFP does not encumber a different application\
    \ on\n   this or a different SFP.  When an implementation finds that it is\n \
    \  unable to generate or send a packet, it SHOULD increment a counter\n   that\
    \ is accessible by the operator and MAY raise an alert (although\n   such alerts\
    \ SHOULD, themselves, be rate limited).\n   Additionally, an SFC node needs to\
    \ protect itself against another\n   node in the network not applying suitable\
    \ rate limits.  Therefore,\n   implementations SHOULD apply incoming rate limits\
    \ for SFC packets\n   with \"Next Protocol\" set to \"None\".  Such rate limits\
    \ MAY be\n   application aware, per SFC or interface, and SHOULD be configurable,\n\
    \   but implementations MAY be more subtle if they are aware of internal\n   processing\
    \ loads and have access to queues/buffers.  In any case,\n   when an implementation\
    \ drops a received packet because of these rate\n   limits, it SHOULD increment\
    \ a counter that is accessible by the\n   operator and MAY raise an alert (although\
    \ such alerts SHOULD,\n   themselves, be rate limited).\n   Suitable default rate\
    \ limits will restrict an SFC node to not send\n   more than one packet with \"\
    Next Protocol\" set to \"None\" per ten data\n   packets on any flow in a unit\
    \ of time equal to the end-to-end\n   delivery time on the flow.\n"

  - "8.  Security Considerations\n   Metadata-only packets as enabled by this document\
    \ provide a covert\n   channel.  However, this is only different from the metadata\
    \ feature\n   in the normal NSH in that it can be sent without the presence of\
    \ a\n   data flow.\n   Metadata may, of course, contain sensitive data and may\
    \ also contain\n   information used to control the behavior of SFIs in the network.\
    \  As\n   such, this data needs to be protected according to its value and\n \
    \  according to the perceived vulnerabilities of the network.\n   Protection of\
    \ metadata may be achieved by using encrypted transport\n   between SFC entities\
    \ or by encrypting the metadata in its own right,\n   and by authenticating the\
    \ sender of the metadata.  The need to\n   protect the metadata is not modified\
    \ by this document and forms part\n   of the NSH definition found in [RFC8300].\n\
    \   The mechanism described in this document might be used to introduce\n   packets\
    \ into the SFC overlay network and might be used to\n   illegitimately introduce\
    \ false metadata to the nodes on an SFC.\n   Therefore, measures SHOULD be taken\
    \ to ensure authorization of\n   sources of such packets, and tunneling of such\
    \ packets into the\n   network SHOULD be prevented.\n   The amount of packets\
    \ with \"Next Protocol\" set to \"None\" on an SFP\n   SHOULD be rate limited\
    \ at each point on the SFP to provide additional\n   network security.\n   Further\
    \ discussion of NSH security is presented in [RFC8300].\n"
