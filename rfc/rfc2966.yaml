  - "Abstract\n   This document describes extensions to the Intermediate System to\n\
    \   Intermediate System (IS-IS) protocol to support optimal routing\n   within\
    \ a two-level domain.  The IS-IS protocol is specified in ISO\n   10589, with\
    \ extensions for supporting IPv4 (Internet Protocol)\n   specified in RFC 1195\
    \ [2].\n   This document extends the semantics presented in RFC 1195 so that a\n\
    \   routing domain running with both level 1 and level 2 Intermediate\n   Systems\
    \ (IS) [routers] can distribute IP prefixes between level 1 and\n   level 2 and\
    \ vice versa.  This distribution requires certain\n   restrictions to insure that\
    \ persistent forwarding loops do not form.\n   The goal of this domain-wide prefix\
    \ distribution is to increase the\n   granularity of the routing information within\
    \ the domain.\n"
- title: 1. Introduction
  contents:
  - "1. Introduction\n   An IS-IS routing domain (a.k.a., an autonomous system running\
    \ IS-IS)\n   can be partitioned into multiple level 1 (L1) areas, and a level\
    \ 2\n   (L2) connected subset of the topology that interconnects all of the\n\
    \   L1 areas.  Within each L1 area, all routers exchange link state\n   information.\
    \  L2 routers also exchange L2 link state information to\n   compute routes between\
    \ areas.\n   RFC 1195 [2] defines the Type, Length and Value (TLV) tuples that\
    \ are\n   used to transport IPv4 routing information in IS-IS.  RFC 1195 also\n\
    \   specifies the semantics and procedures for interactions between\n   levels.\
    \  Specifically, routers in a L1 area will exchange information\n   within the\
    \ L1 area.  For IP destinations not found in the prefixes in\n   the L1 database,\
    \ the L1 router should forward packets to the nearest\n   router that is in both\
    \ L1 and L2 (i.e., an L1L2 router) with the\n   \"attached bit\" set in its L1\
    \ Link State Protocol Data Unit (LSP).\n   Also per RFC 1195, an L1L2 router should\
    \ be manually configured with\n   a set of prefixes that summarizes the IP prefixes\
    \ reachable in that\n   L1 area.  These summaries are injected into L2.  RFC 1195\
    \ specifies\n   no further interactions between L1 and L2 for IPv4 prefixes.\n"
- title: 1.1 Motivations for domain-wide prefix distribution
  contents:
  - "1.1 Motivations for domain-wide prefix distribution\n   The mechanisms specified\
    \ in RFC 1195 are appropriate in many\n   situations, and lead to excellent scalability\
    \ properties.  However,\n   in certain circumstances, the domain administrator\
    \ may wish to\n   sacrifice some amount of scalability and distribute more specific\n\
    \   information than is described by RFC 1195.  This section discusses\n   the\
    \ various reasons why the domain administrator may wish to make\n   such a tradeoff.\n\
    \   One major reason for distributing more prefix information is to\n   improve\
    \ the quality of the resulting routes.  A well know property of\n   prefix summarization\
    \ or any abstraction mechanism is that it\n   necessarily results in a loss of\
    \ information.  This loss of\n   information in turn results in the computation\
    \ of a route based upon\n   less information, which will frequently result in\
    \ routes that are not\n   optimal.\n   A simple example can serve to demonstrate\
    \ this adequately.  Suppose\n   that a L1 area has two L1L2 routers that both\
    \ advertise a single\n   summary of all prefixes within the L1 area.  To reach\
    \ a destination\n   inside the L1 area, any other L2 router is going to compute\
    \ the\n   shortest path to one of the two L1L2 routers for that area.  Suppose,\n\
    \   for example, that both of the L1L2 routers are equidistant from the\n   L2\
    \ source, and that the L2 source arbitrarily selects one L1L2\n   router.  This\
    \ router may not be the optimal router when viewed from\n   the L1 topology. \
    \ In fact, it may be the case that the path from the\n   selected L1L2 router\
    \ to the destination router may traverse the L1L2\n   router that was not selected.\
    \  If more detailed topological\n   information or more detailed metric information\
    \ was available to the\n   L2 source router, it could make a more optimal route\
    \ computation.\n   This situation is symmetric in that an L1 router has no information\n\
    \   about prefixes in L2 or within a different L1 area.  In using the\n   nearest\
    \ L1L2 router, that L1L2 is effectively injecting a default\n   route without\
    \ metric information into the L1 area.  The route\n   computation that the L1\
    \ router performs is similarly suboptimal.\n   Besides the optimality of the routes\
    \ computed, there are two other\n   significant drivers for the domain wide distribution\
    \ of prefix\n   information.\n   When a router learns multiple possible paths\
    \ to external destinations\n   via BGP, it will select only one of those routes\
    \ to be installed in\n   the forwarding table.  One of the factors in the BGP\
    \ route selection\n   is the IGP cost to the BGP next hop address.  Many ISP networks\n\
    \   depend on this technique, which is known as \"shortest exit routing\".\n \
    \  If a L1 router does not know the exact IGP metric to all BGP speakers\n   in\
    \ other L1 areas, it cannot do effective shortest exit routing.\n   The third\
    \ driver is the current practice of using the IGP (IS-IS)\n   metric as part of\
    \ the BGP Multi-Exit Discriminator (MED).  The value\n   in the MED is advertised\
    \ to other domains and is used to inform other\n   domains of the optimal entry\
    \ point into the current domain.  Current\n   practice is to take the IS-IS metric\
    \ and insert it as the MED value.\n   This tends to cause external traffic to\
    \ enter the domain at the point\n   closest to the exit router.  Note that the\
    \ receiving domain may,\n   based upon policy, choose to ignore the MED that is\
    \ advertised.\n   However, current practice is to distribute the IGP metric in\
    \ this way\n   in order to optimize routing wherever possible.  This is possible\
    \ in\n   current networks that only are a single area, but becomes problematic\n\
    \   if hierarchy is to be installed into the network.  This is again\n   because\
    \ the loss of end-to-end metric information means that the MED\n   value will\
    \ not reflect the true distance across the advertising\n   domain.  Full distribution\
    \ of prefix information within the domain\n   would alleviate this problem as\
    \ it would allow accurate computation\n   of the IS-IS metric across the domain,\
    \ resulting in an accurate value\n   presented in the MED.\n"
- title: 1.2 Scalability
  contents:
  - "1.2 Scalability\n   The disadvantage to performing the domain-wide prefix distribution\n\
    \   described above is that it has an impact to the scalability of IS-IS.\n  \
    \ Areas within IS-IS help scalability in that LSPs are contained within\n   a\
    \ single area.  This limits the size of the link state database, that\n   in turn\
    \ limits the complexity of the shortest path computation.\n   Further, the summarization\
    \ of the prefix information aids scalability\n   in that the abstraction of the\
    \ prefix information removes the sheer\n   number of data items to be transported\
    \ and the number of routes to be\n   computed.\n   It should be noted quite strongly\
    \ that the distribution of prefixes\n   on a domain wide basis impacts the scalability\
    \ of IS-IS in the second\n   respect.  It will increase the number of prefixes\
    \ throughout the\n   domain.  This will result in increased memory consumption,\n\
    \   transmission requirements and computation requirements throughout the\n  \
    \ domain.\n   It must also be noted that the domain-wide distribution of prefixes\n\
    \   has no effect whatsoever on the first aspect of scalability, namely\n   the\
    \ existence of areas and the limitation of the distribution of the\n   link state\
    \ database.\n   Thus, the net result is that the introduction of domain-wide prefix\n\
    \   distribution into a formerly flat, single area network is a clear\n   benefit\
    \ to the scalability of that network.  However, it is a\n   compromise and does\
    \ not provide the maximum scalability available\n   with IS-IS.  Domains that\
    \ choose to make use of this facility should\n   be aware of the tradeoff that\
    \ they are making between scalability and\n   optimality and provision and monitor\
    \ their networks accordingly.\n   Normal provisioning guidelines that would apply\
    \ to a fully\n   hierarchical deployment of IS-IS will not apply to this type\
    \ of\n   configuration.\n"
- title: 2. Proposed syntax and semantics for L2->L1 inter-area routes
  contents:
  - "2. Proposed syntax and semantics for L2->L1 inter-area routes\n   This document\
    \ defines the syntax of how to advertise level 2 routes\n   in level 1 LSPs. \
    \ The encoding is an extension of the encoding in RFC\n   1195.\n   To some extent,\
    \ in IS-IS the level 2 backbone can be seen as a\n   separate area itself.  RFC\
    \ 1195 defines that L1L2 routers can\n   advertise IP routes that were learned\
    \ via L1 routing into L2.  These\n   routes can be regarded as inter-area routes.\
    \  RFC 1195 defines that\n   these L1->L2 inter-area routes must be advertised\
    \ in L2 LSPs in the\n   \"IP Internal Reachability Information\" TLV (TLV 128).\
    \  Intra-area L2\n   routes are also advertised in L2 LSPs in an \"IP Internal\
    \ Reachability\n   Information\" TLV.  Therefore, L1->L2 inter-area routes are\n\
    \   indistinguishable from L2 intra-area routes.\n   RFC 1195 does not define\
    \ L2->L1 inter-area routes.  A simple\n   extension would be to allow a L1L2 router\
    \ to advertise routes learned\n   via L2 routing in its L1 LSP.  However, to prevent\
    \ routing-loops,\n   L1L2 routers must never advertise L2->L1 inter-area routes\
    \ that they\n   learn via L1 routing, back into L2.  Therefore, there must be\
    \ a way\n   to distinguish L2->L1 inter-area routes from L1 intra-area routes.\n\
    \   Draft-ietf-isis-traffic-01.txt defines the \"up/down bit\" for this\n   purpose.\
    \  RFC 1195 defines TLVs 128 and 130 to contain IP routes.\n   TVLs 128 and 130\
    \ have a metric field that consists of 4 TOS metrics.\n   The first metric, the\
    \ so-called \"default metric\", has the high-order\n   bit reserved (bit 8). \
    \ Routers must set this bit to zero on\n   transmission, and ignore it on receipt.\n\
    \   This document redefines this high-order bit in the default metric\n   field\
    \ in TLVs 128 and 130 to be the up/down bit.  L1L2 routers must\n   set this bit\
    \ to one for prefixes that are derived from L2 routing and\n   are advertised\
    \ into L1 LSPs.  The bit must be set to zero for all\n   other IP prefixes in\
    \ L1 or L2 LSPs.  Prefixes with the up/down bit\n   set that are learned via L1\
    \ routing, must never be advertised by L1L2\n   routers back into L2.\n"
- title: 2.1 Clarification of external route-type and external metric-type
  contents:
  - "2.1 Clarification of external route-type and external metric-type\n   RFC 1195\
    \ defines two TLVs for carrying IP prefixes.  TLV 128 is\n   defined as \"IP Internal\
    \ Reachability Information\", and should be used\n   to carry IP prefixes that\
    \ are directly connected to IS-IS routers.\n   TLV 130 is defined as \"IP External\
    \ Reachability Information\", and\n   should be used to carry routes learned from\
    \ outside the IS-IS domain.\n   RFC 1195 documents TLV type 130 only for level\
    \ 2 LSPs.\n   RFC 1195 also defines two types of metrics.  Metrics of the internal\n\
    \   metric-type should be used when the metric is comparable to metrics\n   used\
    \ to weigh links inside the ISIS domain.  Metrics of the external\n   metric-type\
    \ should be used if the metric of an IP prefix cannot be\n   directly compared\
    \ to internal metrics. External metric-type can only\n   be used for external\
    \ IP prefixes.  A direct result is that metrics of\n   external metric-type should\
    \ never be seen in TLV 128.\n   To prevent confusion, this document states again\
    \ that when a router\n   computes IP routes, it must give the same preference\
    \ to IP routes\n   advertised in an \"IP Internal Reachability Information\" TLV\
    \ and IP\n   routes advertised in an \"IP External Reachability Information\"\
    \ TLV.\n   RFC 1195 states this quite clearly in the note in paragraph 3.10.2,\n\
    \   item 2c).  This document does not alter this rule of preference.\n       NOTE:\
    \ Internal routes (routes to destinations announced in the\n       \"IP Internal\
    \ Reachability Information\" field), and external\n       routes using internal\
    \ metrics (routes to destinations announced\n       in the \"IP External Reachability\
    \ Information\" field, with a\n       metric of type \"internal\") are treated\
    \ identically for the\n       purpose of the order of preference of routes, and\
    \ the Dijkstra\n       calculation.\n   However, IP routes advertised in \"IP\
    \ External Reachability\n   Information\" with external metric-type must be given\
    \ less preference\n   than the same IP routes advertised with internal-metric\
    \ type,\n   regardless of the value of the metrics.\n   While IS-IS routers must\
    \ not give different preference to IP prefixes\n   learned via \"IP Internal Reachability\
    \ Information\" and \"IP External\n   Reachability Information\" when executing\
    \ the Dijkstra calculation,\n   routers that implement multiple IGPs are free\
    \ to use this distinction\n   between internal and external routes when comparing\
    \ routes derived\n   from different IGPs for inclusion in their global RIB.\n"
- title: 2.2 Definition of external IP prefixes in level 1 LSPs
  contents:
  - "2.2 Definition of external IP prefixes in level 1 LSPs\n   RFC 1195 does not\
    \ define the \"IP External Reachability Information\"\n   TLV for L1 LSPs.  However,\
    \ there is no reason why an IS-IS\n   implementation could not allow for redistribution\
    \ of external routes\n   into L1.  Some IS-IS implementations already allow network\n\
    \   administrators to do this.  This document loosens the restrictions in\n  \
    \ RFC 1195, and allows for the inclusion of the \"IP External\n   Reachability\
    \ Information\" TLV in L1 LSPs.\n   RFC 1195 defines that IP routes learned via\
    \ L1 routing must always be\n   advertised in L2 LSPs in a \"IP Internal Reachability\
    \ Information\"\n   TLV.  Now that this document allows \"IP External Reachability\n\
    \   Information\" TLVs in L1 LSPs, and allows for the advertisement of\n   routes\
    \ learned via L2 routing into L1, the above rule needs a\n   extensions.\n   When\
    \ a L1L2 router advertises a L1 route into L2, where that L1 route\n   was learned\
    \ via a prefix advertised in a \"IP External Reachability\n   Information\" TLV,\
    \ that L1L2 router should advertise that prefix in\n   its L2 LSP within an \"\

    \ Internal Reachability Information\" TLV\n   should still be advertised within\
    \ a \"IP Internal Reachability\n   Information\" TLV.  These rules should also\
    \ be applied when\n   advertising IP routes derived from L2 routing into L1. Of\
    \ course in\n   this case also the up/down bit must be set.\n   RFC 1195 defines\
    \ that if a router sees the same external prefix\n   advertised by two or more\
    \ routers with the same external metric, it\n   must select the route that is\
    \ advertised by the router that is\n   closest to itself.  It should be noted\
    \ that now that external routes\n   can be advertised from L1 into L2, and vice\
    \ versa, that the router\n   that advertises an external prefix in its LSP might\
    \ not be the router\n   that originally injected this prefix into the IS-IS domain.\n\
    \   Therefore, it is less useful to advertise external routes with\n   external\
    \ metrics into other levels.\n"

    \ reason\n   is that this maximum value of 63 does not mean infinity (e.g. like\

  - "3.3 Additional notes on what prefixes to accept or advertise\n   Paragraphs 4.1\
    \ and 4.2 enumerate all used IP route types in IS-IS.\n   Besides these defined\
    \ route types, the encoding used would allow for\n   a few more potential combinations.\
    \  One of them is the combination of\n   \"IP Internal Reachability Information\"\
    \ and external metric type.\n   This combination should never be used when building\
    \ an LSP.  Upon\n   receipt of an IP prefix with this combination, routers must\
    \ ignore\n   this prefix.\n   Another issue would be the usage of the up/down\
    \ bit in L2 LSPs.\n   Because IS-IS is currently defined with two levels of hierarchy,\n\
    \   there should never be a need to set the up/down bit in L2 LSPs.\n   However,\
    \ if IS-IS would ever be extended with more than two levels of\n   hierarchy,\
    \ L2-only (or L1L2) routers will need to be able to accept\n   L2 IP routes with\
    \ the up/down bit set.  Therefore, it is recommended\n   that implementations\
    \ ignore the up/down bit in L2 LSPs, and accept\n   the prefixes in L2 LSPs regardless\
    \ whether the up/down bit is set.\n   This will allow for simpler migration once\
    \ more than two levels of\n   hierarchy are defined.\n   Another detail that implementors\
    \ should be aware of is the fact that\n   L1L2 routers should only advertise in\
    \ their L2 LSP those L1 routes\n   that they use for forwarding themselves.  They\
    \ should not\n   unconditionally advertise into L2 all prefixes from LSPs in the\
    \ L1\n   database.\n   Not all prefixes need to be advertised up or down the hierarchy.\n\
    \   Implementations might allow for additional manual filtering or\n   summarization\
    \ to further bring down the number of inter-area prefixes\n   they advertise in\
    \ their LSPs.  It is also recommended that the\n   default configuration of L1L2\
    \ routers is to not advertise any L2\n   routes into L1 (see also paragraph 5.0).\n"
- title: 4. Inter-operability with older implementations
  contents:
  - "4. Inter-operability with older implementations\n   The solution in this document\
    \ is not fully compatible with RFC 1195.\n   It is an extension to RFC 1195. \
    \ If routers do not use the new\n   functionality of external L1 routes, nor L2->L1\
    \ inter-area routes,\n   older implementations that strictly follow RFC 1195 will\
    \ be\n   compatible with newer implementations that follow this document.\n  \
    \ Implementations that do not accept the \"IP External Reachability\n   Information\"\
    \ TLV in L1 LSPs will not be able to compute external L1\n   routes.  This could\
    \ cause routing loops between L1-only routers that\n   do understand external\
    \ L1 routes for a particular destination, and\n   L1-only routers that use the\
    \ default route pointing the closest\n   attached L1L2 router for that destination.\n\
    \   Implementations that follow RFC 1195 should ignore bit 8 in the\n   default\
    \ metric field when computing routes.  Therefore, even older\n   implementations\
    \ that do not know of the up/down bit should be able to\n   accept the new L2->L1\
    \ inter-area routes.  These older implementations\n   will install the new L2->L1\
    \ inter-area routes as L1 intra-area\n   routes, but that in itself does not cause\
    \ routing loops among L1-only\n   routers.\n   However, it is vital that the up/down\
    \ bit is recognized by L1L2\n   routers.  As has been stated before, L1L2 routers\
    \ must never\n   advertise L2->L1 inter-area routes back into L2.  Therefore,\
    \ if L2\n   routes are advertised down into L1 area, it is required that all L1L2\n\
    \   routers in that area run software that understands the new up/down\n   bit.\
    \  Older implementations that follow RFC 1195 and do not\n   understand the new\
    \ up/down bit will threat the L2->L1 inter-area\n   routes as L1 intra-area routes,\
    \ and they will advertise these routes\n   back into L2.  This can cause routing\
    \ loops, sub-optimal routing or\n   extra routing instability.  For this reason\
    \ it is recommended that\n   implementations by default do not advertise any L2\
    \ routes into L1.\n   Implementations should force the network administrator to\
    \ manually\n   configure L1L2 routers to advertise any L2 routes into L1.\n"
- title: 5. Comparisons with other proposals
  contents:
  - "5. Comparisons with other proposals\n   In [3], a new TLV is defined to transport\
    \ IP prefix information.\n   This TLV format also defines an up/down bit to allow\
    \ for L2->L1\n   inter-area routes.  [3] also defines a new TLV to describe links.\n\
    \   Both TLVs have wider metric space, and have the possibility to define\n  \
    \ sub-TLVs to advertise extra information belonging to the link or\n   prefix.\
    \  The wider metric space in IP prefix TLVs allows for more\n   granular metric\
    \ information about inter-area path costs.  To make\n   full use of the wider\
    \ metric space, network administrators must\n   deploy both new TLVs at the same\
    \ time.\n   Deployment of [3] requires an upgrade of all routers in the network\n\
    \   and a transition to the new TLVs.  Such a network-wide upgrade and\n   transition\
    \ might not be an easy task.  In this case, the solution\n   defined in this document,\
    \ which requires only an upgrade of L1L2\n   routers in selected areas, might\
    \ be a good alternative to the\n   solution defined in [3].\n"
