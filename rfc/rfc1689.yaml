  - "1.   Introduction\n   As the network has grown, along with it there has been\
    \ an increase in\n   the number of software tools and applications to navigate\
    \ the network\n   and make use of the many, varied resources which are part of\
    \ the\n   network.  Within the past two and a half years we have seen a\n   widespread\
    \ adoption of tools such as the archie servers, the Wide\n   Area Information\
    \ Servers (WAIS), the Internet gopher, and the\n   Worldwide Web (WWW).  In addition\
    \ to the acceptance of these tools\n   there are also diverse efforts to enhance\
    \ and customise these tools\n   to meet the needs of particular network communities.\n\
    \   There are many organisations and associations that are focusing on\n   the\
    \ proliferating resources and tools for networked information\n   retrieval (NIR).\
    \  The Networked Information Retrieval Group is a\n   cooperative effort of three\
    \ major players in the field of NIR: The\n   Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF),\
    \ the Association of European\n   Research Networks (RARE) and the Coalition for\
    \ Networked Information\n   (CNI), specifically tasked to collect and disseminate\
    \ information\n   about the tools and to discuss and encourage cooperative development\n\
    \   of current and future tools.\n   The purpose of this report is to increase\
    \ the awareness of NIR by\n   bringing together in one place information about\
    \ the various\n   networked information retrieval tools, their developers, interested\n\
    \   organisations, and other activities that relate to the production,\n   dissemination,\
    \ and support of NIR tools.  The intention is to make\n   this a \"living document\"\
    .  It will be held on-line so that each\n   section may be updated separately\
    \ as appropriate.  In addition, it is\n   intended that the full document will\
    \ be updated once a year so that\n   it provides a \"snapshot\" report on activities\
    \ in this area.\n   Whilst the NIR tools in this report are being used on a wide\
    \ variety\n   of information sources including files and databases there remains\n\
    \   much that is currently not accessible by these means.  On the other\n   hand,\
    \ the majority of the NIR Tools described here are freely\n   available to the\
    \ networked Research and Education community.  Tools\n   for accessing specialised\
    \ datasets are often only available at a\n   cost.\n   It should be noted that\
    \ in many ways networked information retrieval\n   is in its infancy compared\
    \ with traditional information retrieval\n   systems.  Thesaurus construction,\
    \ boolean searching and\n   classification control are issues which are under\
    \ discussion for the\n   popular NIR Tools but as yet are not in widespread use.\
    \  However it\n   should be said that, with the vast amount of effort that is\
    \ currently\n   going into the NIR field, rapid progress is being made.  Much\
    \ work is\n   currently being done on expanding some of the NIR tools to include\n\
    \   handling of multimedia information services.  Progress has also been\n   made\
    \ in the discussions on classifying and cataloguing electronic\n   information\
    \ resources.\n"
- title: 2.  How the information was collected
  contents:
  - "2.  How the information was collected\n   The information contained in this report\
    \ was collected over the\n   network from the contacts for each NIR Tool or Group\
    \ using two\n   templates:\n     - the NIR Tool Template, included in Appendix\
    \ A;\n     - the NIR Group Template, included in Appendix B.\n   The contents\
    \ of these templates were discussed by the NIR WG in\n   Boston (July, 1992) and\
    \ subsequently on the email list.  (See the\n   Section on the NIR-WG for details\
    \ of how to join this mailing list.)\n   The initial draft report was discussed\
    \ at the NIR Working Group in\n   Washington (November, 1992) and updated and\
    \ added to at subsequent WG\n   meetings.  Before the final submission as an RFC\
    \ the individual\n   templates were reviewed by independent reviewers from around\
    \ the\n   world.  Their efforts are acknowledged in Section 9.\n   The NIR Tool\
    \ template was used to collect the information necessary\n   to identify and track\
    \ the development of networked information\n   retrieval tools.  This template\
    \ asked for information such as how and\n   where to get the software for each\
    \ NIR Tool, documentation,\n   demonstration sites, etc.  The main part of the\
    \ template has been\n   completed by the main individual responsible for the tool.\
    \  Sections\n   of the template (e.g., on clients) may have required completion\
    \ by\n   others.\n   The NIR Group template requested information on the aim and\
    \ purpose\n   of the group, the current tasks being undertaken, mailing lists,\n\
    \   document archives, etc.\n"

- title: 5.  Overview of the types of NIR Tools
  contents:
  - "5.  Overview of the types of NIR Tools\n   The following is an overview of major\
    \ networked information retrieval\n   (NIR) tools available on the Internet. \
    \ There are many excellent\n   books which discuss the Internet and NIR Tools\
    \ in detail.  Such books\n   include \"The Whole Internet User's Guide and Catalog\"\
    \ by Ed Krol and\n   published by O'Reilly and Associates, Inc and \"The Internet\
    \ Guide for\n   New Users\" by Daniel Dearn and published by Meckler.\n   The\
    \ number of these NIR tools is large and growing quickly.  Certain\n   techniques\
    \ reappear regularly and seemingly different tools may\n   perform similar tasks,\
    \ allowing a simple classification of projects\n   encompassing most of the existing\
    \ tools and services.\n   The classification presented here is only one possible\
    \ ordering.  The\n   goal is to define in broad outlines what can be done with\
    \ particular\n   tools, realizing that users will always find novel unanticipated\
    \ ways\n   of applying them.\n   Interactive Information Delivery Services (Gopher,\
    \ World Wide Web)\n      Basic Internet services such as electronic mail and anonymous\
    \ FTP\n      can be used to share information across the Internet, but neither\n\
    \      allows simple browsing and neither is particularly easy for the\n     \
    \ newcomer to learn to use.  Gopher and the World Wide Web (W3) are\n      two\
    \ recent developments that attempt to make it easier to\n      distribute information\
    \ over the Internet.  Both allow the user to\n      browse information across\
    \ the network without the necessity of\n      logging in or knowing in advance\
    \ where to look for information.\n      The Gopher project was first developed\
    \ at the University of\n      Minnesota to provide a simple campus-wide on-line\
    \ information\n      system.  Gopher represents information as a simple hierarchy\
    \ of\n      menus and files.  It has limited capability to recognize different\n\
    \      types of files, allowing, for example, the display of selected\n      types\
    \ of image files.  Gateways to other services are provided\n      (usually in\
    \ a manner that is transparent to the user).  The\n      underlying Gopher protocol\
    \ is simple, and has facilitated the\n      creation of freely available clients\
    \ for use on a variety of\n      hardware platforms and operating systems.  The\
    \ more recent Gopher+\n      protocol adds the ability to provide documents in\
    \ alternate forms\n      (PDF, PostScript, RTF, Word).  These features and the\
    \ ease of\n      installing and administering gopher servers has led to an\n \
    \     explosive growth of gopher sites since its initial deployment.  As\n   \
    \   of November 1993, there were over 2200 known servers.\n      World Wide Web\
    \ relies on hypertext; formatted documents are\n      displayed, and hypertext\
    \ links within the document can be selected\n      to travel from the current\
    \ document to another.  W3 allows a user\n      to annotate documents (using hypertext\
    \ links), provides gateways\n      to other services, and has multimedia support\
    \ (for example, on\n      appropriate hardware platforms it can intermix text\
    \ and images in\n      a displayed document).  There is a range of free W3 clients,\n\
    \      supporting many environments.  World Wide Web was originally\n      developed\
    \ at CERN for the High Energy Physics Community.\n      Gopher and WWW share a\
    \ maintenance problem in that there is no\n      automated way to update links\
    \ to other documents when those\n      documents are moved or removed.\n   Directory\
    \ Services (WHOIS, X.500)\n      Directory Service tools are intended to provide\
    \ a lookup service\n      for locating information about users (often referred\
    \ to as White\n      Pages), or services and service providers (Yellow Pages).\
    \  For\n      example, a White Pages service might be used to locate an\n    \
    \  electronic mail address, given a name and organization, while a\n      Yellow\
    \ Pages service could be used to locate an online library\n      catalog or file\
    \ archive site.\n      One of the first directory services deployed on the Internet\
    \ was\n      WHOIS, a simple White Pages service created to track key network\n\
    \      contacts for the early DARPA-sponsored incarnation of the\n      Internet.\
    \  A number of sites currently operate WHOIS servers,\n      based on a range\
    \ of extensions and enhancements to the original\n      model.  WHOIS enjoys the\
    \ advantages of simplicity and the presence\n      of WHOIS client software on\
    \ a preponderance of Internet-connected\n      hosts.  Work is underway on a more\
    \ powerful protocol, known as\n      WHOIS++, which is backwards-compatible with\
    \ WHOIS.\n      The X.500 Directory Service is a much more ambitious Directory\n\
    \      project that has been under development for a number of years\n      under\
    \ the aegis of ISO/OSI.  Implementations, concerned primarily\n      with White\
    \ pages services, are available in the public domain and\n      from commercial\
    \ sources.  There are LDAP based X.500 clients\n      available for most major\
    \ platforms, as well as a LDAP based gopher\n      gateway to X.500.\n      Despite\
    \ years of effort, there is still no single White Pages\n      Directory Service\
    \ for the entire Internet; Yellow Pages services\n      remain even less well\
    \ developed and deployed.  The cost of setting\n      up the service is one obstacle;\
    \ maintaining the required databases\n      is even more daunting.\n   Indexing\
    \ Services (archie, Veronica, online library catalogs)\n      There are several\
    \ Internet-based projects that build indexed\n      catalogs of information to\
    \ facilitate searching and retrieval.\n      The first such services provided\
    \ network access to library card\n      catalogs, with more recent projects indexing\
    \ network-based\n      information.\n   archie:\n      The archie service began\
    \ as a simple project to catalog the\n      contents of hundreds of ftp-accessible\
    \ online file archives.  The\n      archie service gathers location information,\
    \ name, and other\n      details describing such files and creates an index database.\n\
    \      Users can contact an archie server and search this database for\n     \
    \ files they require.\n      The archie service is accessible through a range\
    \ of access\n      methods, including telnet, stand-alone client programs running\
    \ on\n      a user's own machine, gopher, WWW, or via electronic mail.  The\n\
    \      initial implementation of archie tracks over 2,100,000 filenames\n    \
    \  on over 1,200 sites around the world (as of November 1993).  There\n      are\
    \ about 30 (geographically distributed) archie servers.  Both\n      commercial\
    \ and freely available versions of the archie client\n      software are available.\n\
    \      Work continues on extending the archie service to provide\n      additional\
    \ types of information.  The latest version is being used\n      to provide a\
    \ prototype Yellow Pages service and directories of\n      online library catalogs\
    \ and electronic mailing lists.\n   Veronica:\n      Veronica arose as an attempt\
    \ to do for the world of Gopher what\n      archie did for the world of ftp. \
    \ A central server periodically\n      scans the complete menu hierarchies of\
    \ Gopher servers appearing on\n      an ever-expanding list (over 2000 sites as\
    \ of November 1993).  The\n      resulting index is provided by a veronica server\
    \ and can be\n      accessed by any gopher client.\n   Online library catalogs:\n\
    \      A large number of libraries make their computerized library\n      catalogs\
    \ available over the Internet.  Most are available through\n      telnet sessions\
    \ in which the user connects to a specific address\n      and logs in using a\
    \ specific login name.  Some are also available\n      through other tools, such\
    \ as Gopher.\n   Text-based Indexing Services (WAIS)\n   WAIS:\n      Wide Area\
    \ Information Servers (WAIS) is a system for indexing and\n      serving information\
    \ in a network-based environment.  It is\n      distinct from indexing tools such\
    \ as archie and veronica in that\n      it is used to index text-based target\
    \ documents on a server, as\n      well as descriptions of the contents of a server.\n\
    \      A WAIS server allows the administrator to set up an index of the\n    \
    \  documents (or resources) to be published.  The user employs a WAIS\n      client\
    \ to attach to a particular WAIS server, and specifies a\n      search pattern\
    \ which is matched against the server's index.  In\n      early WAIS clients,\
    \ searches are specified as simple natural-\n      language queries; common (\"\
    stop\") words are removed, and Boolean\n      \"ORs\" are implicitly added between\
    \ the remaining list of words.\n      Matching documents are rank-ordered according\
    \ to a simple\n      statistical weighting scheme which attempts to indicate likely\n\
    \      relevance.  The user may choose to view selected documents, or\n      further\
    \ refine the search.  The results of one search may be used\n      to successively\
    \ refine future searches (\"relevance feedback\").\n      Gopher clients can also\
    \ access WAIS servers via a transparent\n      gateway.\n      Both freely available\
    \ and commercial versions of WAIS servers and\n      clients are available.  Current\
    \ work is attempting to add Boolean\n      expressions and proximity and field\
    \ specifications to queries.\n      There are currently (as of November 1993)\
    \ some 500 registered WAIS\n      databases with an estimated 2000 additional\
    \ databases that are not\n      yet registered.  There are approximately another\
    \ 100 commercial\n      WAIS databases.\n"

    \ NIR Tool Name:      Alex\n Brief Description of Tool:\n   OVERVIEW:\n      The\
    \ Alex filesystem provides users and applications transparent\n      read access\
    \ to files in anonymous FTP sites on the Internet.\n      Today there are thousands\
    \ of anonymous FTP sites with a total of a\n      few millions of files and roughly\
    \ a terabyte of data.  The\n      standard approach to accessing these files involves\
    \ logging in to\n      the remote machine.  This means that an application can\
    \ not access\n      remote files like local files.  This also means that users\
    \ do not\n      have any of their aliases or local tools available.  Users who\n\
    \      want to use an application on a remote file first have to manually\n  \
    \    make a local copy of the file.  There is no mechanism for\n      automatically\
    \ updating this local copy when the remote file\n      changes.  The users must\
    \ keep track of where they get their files\n      from and check to see if there\
    \ are updates, and then fetch these.\n      In this approach many different users\
    \ at the same site may have\n      made copies of the same remote file each using\
    \ up disk space for\n      the same data.\n      Alex addresses the problems with\
    \ the existing approach while\n      remaining within the existing FTP protocol\
    \ so that the large\n      collection of currently available files can be used.\
    \  To get\n      reasonable performance long term file caching is used.  Thus\n\
    \      consistency is an issue.  Traditional solutions to the cache\n      consistency\
    \ problem do not work in the Internet FTP domain:\n      callbacks are not an\
    \ option as the FTP protocol has no provisions\n      for this and polling over\
    \ the Internet is slow.  Therefore, Alex\n      relaxes file cache consistency\
    \ semantics, on a per file basis, and\n      uses special caching algorithms that\
    \ take into account the\n      properties of the files and of the network to allow\
    \ a simple\n      stateless filesystem to scale to the size of the Internet.\n\
    \   USER'S VIEW:\n      To a user or application, Alex is just a normal filesystem.\
    \  Any\n      command that works on local files will work on Alex files.  Since\n\
    \      Alex is a real filesystem, nothing needs to be recompiled and no\n    \
    \  libraries are changed.  Thus, users can apply all of their\n      existing\
    \ skills and tools for using files.\n      The user sees a filesystem with a hierarchical\
    \ name space.  At the\n      top level (/alex) there are top-level Internet domains\
    \ like \"edu\",\n      \"com\", \"uk\", and \"jp\".  Each component of the hostname\
    \ becomes a\n      directory name. Then the remote path is added at the end. \
    \ If the\n      user does a \"ls /alex/edu/berkeley\" he sees some machine names\n\
    \      such as \"ucbvax\" and \"sprite\" and some directories on\n      berkeley.edu.\
    \  From the \"ls\" it is not clear what is where.  The\n      user may or may\
    \ not be aware of host boundaries.\n   INFORMATION PROVIDER'S VIEW:\n      Alex\
    \ is implemented as a user level NFS server.  NFS was chosen\n      because it\
    \ makes it easy to add Alex to a wide range of machines.\n      Most machines\
    \ can simply use the mount command.\n      The model of usage is that there is\
    \ one Alex server running at\n      each institution (though this is not required\
    \ in any way).  Users\n      mount the local server which caches files for users\
    \ at that site.\n      Any information put into any anonymous FTP site becomes\
    \ available\n      via Alex.\n ----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\

    \ NIR Tool Name:                  archie\n Brief Description of Tool:\n   The\
    \ archie system is a tool for gathering, indexing and serving\n   information\
    \ from around the Internet.  The current version serves a\n   collection of filenames\
    \ found at anonymous FTP sites, as well as a\n   smaller collection of text descriptions\
    \ for software, data and other\n   information found at anonymous FTP archives.\
    \  Additional databases\n   are under development.\n   User's View:\n      Users\
    \ run a client program to connect to an archie server and\n      issue search\
    \ commands to find information in an archie database.\n      In the case of an\
    \ anonymous FTP filename, this information can\n      then be used to fetch the\
    \ file directly from the archive site\n      using the `ftp' command.  To the\
    \ user, archie could be seen as a\n      `secondary source' of information which,\
    \ because of the high cost\n      of locating and serving, would not otherwise\
    \ be available.\n      The user searches the archie databases through either a\
    \ telnet\n      session to a machine running an archie server, or by using a\n\
    \      stand-alone client program (which uses the Prospero protocol for\n    \
    \  sending and receiving requests).  There is also an email interface\n      which\
    \ allows users to send and receive search requests via\n      electronic mail.\n\
    \      Freely available archie clients exist for most operating systems\n    \
    \  and can be fetched using anonymous FTP from most of the current\n      archie\
    \ servers.  There are also gateways to the archie system from\n      many other\
    \ NIR tools, including Gopher, WAIS and WWW.  An X.500\n      interface to archie\
    \ is currently under development.\n   Information Provider's View:\n      There\
    \ are two types of information providers who would be\n      interested in archie.\
    \  Primary information providers are\n      interested in having a summary of\
    \ the information provided by\n      their service tracked by an archie server.\
    \  Secondary service\n      providers, or those sites wishing to provide a \"\
    value-added\"\n      service for the Internet can elect to run an archie server\
    \ at\n      their site to provide a useful service to users, to raise the\n  \
    \    profile of their institution on the Internet, or to provide market\n    \
    \  differentiation (for commercial service providers).\n      The archie system\
    \ is of particular utility serving information\n      where there are many sites\
    \ to be searched and/or where the cost of\n      searching each site is high.\n\
    \      For example, there are currently over 1,200 anonymous FTP sites on\n  \
    \    the Internet, and the number continues to grow.  Searching for a\n      specific\
    \ filename at a single site may involve scanning hundreds,\n      or even thousands\
    \ of filenames.  Thus, most operators of anonymous\n      FTP archives welcome\
    \ the fact that archie indexes and serves the\n      names of all files available\
    \ from each site tracked.\n   Information Types Supported:\n      The archie system\
    \ allows the gathering and serving of arbitrary\n      information types, although\
    \ the current system serves only\n      freeform text and a dedicated text format\
    \ for filename listings.\n      Internally, the archie system now supports a WAIS\
    \ search engine\n      and frontends for Gopher, WWW and WHOIS++ for accessing\
    \ archie\n      information through Gopher clients is now being tested.\n    \
    \  Additional collections of information to be served by the archie\n      software\
    \ will be announced.\n -----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\

    \   Protocols:\n   What is supported:\n      The current archie system clients\
    \ use the Prospero protocol for\n      communication with the search engine on\
    \ the archie server.  Freely\n      available clients are available which include\
    \ source to perform\n      this communication for those wishing to implement additional\n\
    \      clients.\n      The archie server is capable of building arbitrary databases,\n\
    \      using arbitrary search and access engines and the current release\n   \
    \   ships with the public domain implementation of WAIS.  We expect\n      future\
    \ archie servers to serve information using this protocol.\n      The current\
    \ server system assumes the TCP/IP protocol suite is\n      available, and in\
    \ particular the ftp protocol for data gathering.\n      The archie system can\
    \ be accessed through systems operating the\n      Gopher, WAIS and WWW (HDDL)\
    \ protocols.  A gateway from the X.500\n      system is under development.\n \
    \  What it runs over:\n      The Prospero protocol implementation runs over its\
    \ own\n      implementation of a reliable datagram protocol based upon UDP.\n\
    \      Data gathering runs over the TCP/IP protocol suite.\n   Other NIR tools\
    \ this interworks with:\n      Prospero, Gopher, WAIS, WWW.\n   Future plans:\n\
    \      The archie system became a commercial product in October, 1992,\n     \
    \ marketed by Bunyip Information Systems Inc.  The company plans to\n      market\
    \ additional data gathering modules to allow the server code\n      to build additional\
    \ types of databases.  Work is also underway to\n      integrate extensions to\
    \ WHOIS to allow the building and\n      maintaining of White Pages (names) directories.\
    \  The company is\n      also working on other Internet information tools that\
    \ will work\n      with the archie system.\n -----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\

    \ NIR Tool Name:  Internet Gopher\n Brief Description of Tool:\n   The Internet\
    \ Gopher protocol is a client/distributed-server document\n   search and retrieval\
    \ protocol originally developed at the University\n   of Minnesota.  Gopher was\
    \ originally created as a fast, simple,\n   distributed, campus-wide information\
    \ search and retrieval system;\n   ease of use and implementation has made Gopher\
    \ increasingly popular\n   on the Internet.  Since its original release, many\
    \ folks on the\n   Internet have contributed to its growth, submitting patches,\
    \ servers,\n   clients, and linking their local servers into the worldwide network\n\
    \   of Gopher servers.  Gateways exist to seamlessly access a variety of\n   non-Gopher\
    \ services such as ftp, WAIS, USENET news, Archie, Z39.50\n   (1992 rev), X.500\
    \ directories, Sybase and Oracle SQL servers, etc.\n   In addition, an \"archie\
    \ for gopherspace\" called Veronica (very easy\n   rodent-oriented net-wide index\
    \ to computerized archives) has been\n   developed at the University of Nevada.\
    \  Veronica makes it easy to\n   search for items in gopherspace by title.\n \
    \  The gopher protocol is often described as \"fiercely simple\"; it is\n   connectionless\
    \ (stateless), and uses TCP reliable streams.  A client\n   connects to a server\
    \ using TCP, and sends a one-line text \"selector\n   string\".  The server responds\
    \ by returning the item (a file, a\n   directory listing, or a link to some other\
    \ service) corresponding to\n   the selector string and immediately closing the\
    \ connection.  Items in\n   directory listings are returned as a series of lines\
    \ terminated by\n   carriage-return line-feed.  Each item (line) is defined by\
    \ a one-\n   character tag to specify the item type, a display string or item-name\n\
    \   that the client should display to the user, and a number of tab\n   delimited\
    \ fields to specify the selector string, host domain name and\n   port number.\
    \  Because of its simple and connectionless nature, gopher\n   servers make very\
    \ minimal demands on their host machines and gopher\n   clients are extremely\
    \ easy to implement.\n   The users view the Gopher world as a series of networked\
    \ hierarchical\n   directories much like a familiar filesystem.  However, the\
    \ links\n   define a graph rather than a simple rooted tree.  Links in the Gopher\n\
    \   graph may define services other than simple files or directories;\n   these\
    \ include cso (qi) servers, telnet sessions, links to other\n   gopher servers,\
    \ and links to gateway servers.\n   The information provider's simplest view is\
    \ that files and\n   directories below a certain root directory on their machine\
    \ are all\n   visible and available for retrieval by gopher clients.  More features\n\
    \   like long names, item types, links, and gateway services are\n   available\
    \ to the more sophisticated information provider.\n   Servers and clients run\
    \ on most popular hardware, including Macs,\n   UNIX boxes, PC-DOS boxes.  The\
    \ Internet Gopher name is copyright (c)\n   1991-1992 by the University of Minnesota.\
    \  The Internet Gopher\n   protocol is described in an informational RFC (1436)\
    \ available at\n   better RFC archives everywhere.  Extensions to the base gopher\n\
    \   protocol allow for associating meta-information with gopher items,\n   alternate\
    \ views of documents (i.e., text, postscript, rtf, etc.) and\n   electronic forms.\
    \  Collectively, these extensions are referred to as\n   Gopher+.  Gopher+ is\
    \ upward compatible with the orginal gopher\n   protocol.  The gopher software\
    \ may be retrieved from numerous Gopher\n   or FTP archive sites, including the\
    \ University of Minnesota Gopher\n   server, the Info-Mac Archive Gopher server,\
    \ and by anonymous FTP from\n   boombox.micro.umn.edu and sumex-aim.stanford.edu.\
    \ As of December\n   1993, about 1/3 of the approximately 4800 Gopher servers\
    \ on the\n   internet support Gopher+.\n -----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\

    \ NIR Tool Name: Netfind\n Brief Description of Tool:\n   Given the name of a\
    \ person on the Internet and a rough description of\n   where the person works,\
    \ Netfind attempts to locate information about\n   the person.  People can be\
    \ specified by first, last, or login name.\n   Their place of work can be described\
    \ by name and/or the\n   city/state/country.\n   Netfind provides textual information\
    \ about people, when it is able to\n   locate such information.  It is not a directory\
    \ in the usual sense of\n   the word.  Rather, it searches for people using a\
    \ number of Internet\n   services and heuristics about how to locate user information.\n\
    \   Because of the techniques it uses, Netfind can locate information\n   about\
    \ more people than any other Internet user directory - over 5\n   million people\
    \ in over 9,000 domains worldwide when last measured.\n   You can use the University\
    \ of Colorado Netfind server by telnet to\n   bruno.cs.colorado.edu: login as\
    \ \"netfind\" (with no password).  Help\n   screens providing more detailed instructions\
    \ and technical\n   information are available there.  There is currently no way\
    \ for non-\n   Internet users to access Netfind (e.g., using an email interface).\n\

    \ about Netfind, available\n  in\n  ftp://ftp.cs.colorado.edu/pub/cs/techreports/schwartz/PostScript/\n\
    \      Netfind.Gathering.ps.Z  (compressed PostScript)\n  or\n  ftp://ftp.cs.colorado.edu/pub/cs/techreports/schwartz/ASCII/\n\

    \      White.Pages.txt.Z,\n  containing some of the original ideas in Netfind\
    \ and measurements of\n  the system.  The Netfind.Gathering paper contains an\
    \ up-to-date\n  description of the data gathering and integration algorithms.\n\
    \  The third source of information focuses particularly on the URL-based\n  remote\

    \ Tool Name: Prospero\n Brief Description of Tool:\n   The Prospero directory\
    \ service supports a user centered view of files\n   scattered across the Internet.\
    \  It can be used to organize references\n   to files as if they were on your\
    \ local system, without the need to\n   physically move them.\n   Prospero provides\
    \ access to existing directories and indices that can\n   be used to find files\
    \ of interest that are available from Internet\n   archive sites.  Among the indices\
    \ available is the archie database\n   and a gateway to all Gopher menus, files,\
    \ and searches.  We hope to\n   have WAIS indices and World Wide Web documents\
    \ online in the near\n   future.\n   Prospero also provides a mechanism to make\
    \ directories and indices\n   available to end-users and applications in a format\
    \ that allows\n   information from different sources to be integrated into a coherent\n\
    \   whole.\n   Prospero does not interpret the data that it organizes.  It does\n\
    \   provide mechanisms to retrieve the data, but the display and use of\n   the\
    \ data is up to the user's application.  Prospero is intended to\n   serve as\
    \ infrastructure that integrates information from a variety of\n   sources and\
    \ supports a variety of user applications.\n   Prospero allows fine grained authorization\
    \ of requests to all\n   objects, including directories and indices.  Prospero\
    \ supports the\n   authentication of clients through four mechanisms: (a) simple\
    \ client\n   assertion of the user's identity; (b) a trusted port mechanism\n\
    \   similar to that used by the Berkeley UNIX R commands; (c) a simple\n   cleartext\
    \ passwording mechanism; (d) Kerberos (version 5).  The\n   maintainer of an ACL\
    \ chooses which of these mechanisms he or she\n   wishes to accept as proof of\
    \ the client's identity.\n -----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\

    \   Via Prospero: /releases/prospero/prospero.tar.Z, in the\n       \"#/INET/EDU/ISI/GUEST/prototype\"\
    \ virtual system.\n   Note that the name prospero.tar.Z refers to the most stable\
    \ release\n   (currently Beta version 5.1).  If you want the latest version of\n\
    \   the server (which includes the Gopher gateway), you should retrieve\n   it\
    \ by version number; the name for the latest version is\n   prospero-alpha.5.2.tar.Z\n\
    \  Location of more information:\n   Contained within the release.\n  Latest version\
    \ number:\n   Alpha Version 5.3\n  Brief Scope and Characteristics:\n   The server\
    \ allows the maintainer to make directory information\n   available about selected\
    \ portions of the server's filesystem, such as\n   anonymously FTPable files.\
    \  The server also is used to publish\n   information from other databases, such\
    \ as Archie.  The server also\n   allows users and maintainers to store their\
    \ own customized organizing\n   views of the namespace.  Release Alpha.5.2 of\
    \ the server includes a\n   gateway feature which treats all Gopher servers as\
    \ a Prospero\n   database.\n  Approximate number of such servers in use:\n   50\n\
    \  General comments:\n  Future plans:\n   We have a prototype NFS server that\
    \ makes Prospero queries, but it is\n   not yet ready to release.  We plan to\
    \ develop a gateway similar to\n   the existing Gopher gateway feature for World\
    \ Wide Web.  There is\n   also active work being done on exporting WAIS indices\
    \ through\n   Prospero in a way similar to the way the archie database is exported.\n\

    \ it by version number; the name for the latest version is\n   prospero-alpha.5.2.tar.Z\n\
    \  Latest Version number:\n   Alpha Version 5.2\n  Brief Scope and Characteristics:\n\
    \   We provide two client interfaces.  The older one is a command-line\n   client,\
    \ which can be configured to use the same syntax to navigate\n   through the Prospero\
    \ namespace that a user uses to navigate through\n   the UNIX filesystem.  (\"\
    cd\", \"ls\", etc.) The newer one is a menu-\n   based file and directory browser\
    \ similar to the UNIX Gopher client.\n  General comments:\n   Archie clients also\
    \ make queries in the Prospero namespace, so all\n   Archie clients are Prospero\
    \ clients too.  They are better described\n   in the Archie report.\n  Future\
    \ plans:\n   We are working on enhancing the menu browser client to allow users\
    \ to\n   remotely customize and update virtual systems.  We plan to develop a\n\
    \   Prospero hypertext browser.\n -----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\
    \ Demonstration sites:\n  A guest virtual system is available on PROSPERO.ISI.EDU.\
    \  However, to\n  use it, you must compile the Prospero command-line client on\
    \ your own\n  machine.  Instructions for using it come with the Prospero\n  distribution.\n\

    \ Other Information:\n  We provide three documented library interfaces to Prospero\

    \ directly make Prospero requests\n  and parse the results and to manipulate Prospero\
    \ objects as\n  abstractions.  The PCOMPAT library is an interface to the PFS\
    \ library\n  which uses the same interface as the UNIX filesystem; one can link\n\
    \  many existing programs with the PCOMPAT library in order to get it to\n  resolve\
    \ names in the Prospero namespace.  It is not as portable as the\n  PFS library\
    \ and does not provide as much functionality.\n  The third library interface is\
    \ the menu-browser API library.  It is\n  documented in the menu-based browser\
    \ API manual and is used by our\n  menu-based browser.\n =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=\n\

    \ Tool Name:  veronica\n Brief Description of Tool:\n   veronica: Very Easy Rodent-Oriented\
    \ Net-wide Index to Computerized\n             Archives.\n   veronica is the comprehensive\
    \ title-index of the world's gopher\n   servers.  Because of veronica, the Gopher\
    \ web is a search-and-\n   retrieval system as well as a browsing system.  veronica\
    \ is popular\n   because the ubiquitous Gopher client can both access the search\n\
    \   server, and provide immediate access to the discovered resources.\n   Taking\
    \ advantage of Gopher's linked menus, and of the policy of open\n   access at\
    \ most gopher sites, veronica finds and indexes almost all\n   items on publicly-accessible\
    \ gopher servers.\n   As of February, 1994, veronica holds indexes to more than\
    \ 3200 gopher\n   servers on approximately 2500 internet hosts.  In February 1994\
    \ the\n   public-access veronica sites served an estimated 1,200,000 queries.\n\
    \   Most queries are resolved in less than twenty seconds.  Eight server\n   sites\
    \ offer searches to the internet community, and several other\n   institutions\
    \ run servers for internal access.\n   veronica is easily accessed via any Gopher\
    \ client.  It offers various\n   types of searches, ranging from single-keyword\
    \ searches to boolean\n   queries of indefinite complexity.\n   A veronica search\
    \ originates with a user's request for a search,\n   submitted from a gopher client.\
    \  The searches may include boolean\n   operators ( AND, OR, NOT, and parentheses\
    \ ) and several options to\n   control the number of items returned, and to restrict\
    \ the search to\n   certain gopher types.  The result of a veronica search is\
    \ a set of\n   gopher-type data items, which is returned to the gopher client\
    \ as a\n   gopher menu.  Each item on this menu contains the user's desired\n\
    \   keyword or keywords in the item title.\n   The user can access any of the\
    \ gopher items by selecting from the\n   returned menu.  Items on this menu may\
    \ be drawn from many gopher\n   servers.  Because veronica is accessed through\
    \ gopher clients, it\n   provides immediate access to all types of data supported\
    \ by the\n   gopher protocol and the client implementation.\n   The veronica service\
    \ comprises two functions:\n   1) Harvesting menu data from gopher servers, and\
    \ preparing it for\n      use;\n   2) Offering searches of that database to gopher\
    \ clients.\n   These two functions are not necessarily provided by the same host\n\
    \   computer.  Currently collection and preparation of data are done at\n   University\
    \ of Nevada, and datasets are distributed to the other\n   veronica servers.\n\
    \   The veronica service infrastructure has been fairly stable since\n   July,\
    \ 1993, with eight server sites offering searches for the\n   internet community\
    \ (March 1994).  These servers are supported by the\n   participating institutions:\
    \ NYSERNET, PSI, SERRA, CNIDR, University\n   of Koeln, SUNET, University of Bergen\
    \ and the University of Nevada\n   System Computing Services.  Several additional\
    \ servers offer searches\n   with access limited to internal users; in this class\
    \ are servers at\n   MSU, SUNET, and the Australian University system.\n   An\
    \ auxiliary tool to build a locally held menu of Public available\n   has been\
    \ created.  Called \"maltshop\", it has been distributed since\n   January, 1994.\
    \  It appears that maltshop is rapidly being accepted,\n   but its long-term effect\
    \ on loading of the servers may be\n   problematic.\n -----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\

    \      0.6.5\n  Next planned version:         0.7b   (March 1994)\n  Brief Scope\
    \ and Characteristics:\n   Two modules:    a data-collection module and a data-server\
    \ module.\n   1.      Data-collector runs on any Unix computer that does TCP\n\
    \           and compiles perl.  This has not been distributed yet.\n         \
    \  Data collection, data preparation, and indexing are being\n           done\
    \ at veronica.scs.unr.edu.  The harvester \"walks\" all\n           advertised\
    \ gopher servers, and any newly-discovered servers.\n           Almost all redundant\
    \ links are removed, leaving the\n           ( hopefully ) canonical reference\
    \ for each item.\n           Indexes are built at Nevada, and the indexed dataset\
    \ is\n           distributed to server sites.\n   2.      Server module.\n   \
    \        Servers run on unix computers and answer to gopher-type-7\n         \
    \  requests.  Boolean keyword logic is implemented.  See file\n           \"how-to-compose-veronica-queries\"\
    .  Several options allow\n           retrieval of items with specified gopher-types,\
    \ retrieval\n           of a file of links containing the search results, and\n\
    \           override for the default limit on number of results returned,\n  \
    \         which is 200 items.\n           Server software runs on most flavors\
    \ of unix, requires dbm\n           and perl, and requires about 1.4 GB of data\
    \ on disk, with\n           considerable /tmp space available.\n           Server\
    \ software is available to any site which wants to run\n           a server. \
    \ Server sites are encouraged to offer the service\n           to the net at large.\n\
    \  Approximate number of such servers in use:  twelve.\n  Auxiliary tool:  Maltshop\

    \   Basic veronica service has been fairly stable since July 1993.\n   Indexing\
    \ is quite efficient, and most queries are resolved in ten\n   seconds or quicker.\
    \  More than 1,000,000 queries were resolved in\n   February, 1994.\n   Though\
    \ veronica is well-accepted at this level of service, we are\n   undertaking significant\
    \ upgrade efforts during Winter 93-94.\n -----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\

    \ NIR Tool Name:   WAIS\n Brief Description of Tool:\n   WAIS - The Wide Area\
    \ Information Servers system - is an electronic\n   publishing software set which\
    \ allows you to search out and retrieve\n   multimedia information from databases\
    \ anywhere in the world.  WAIS\n   databases may be accessed by WAIS, gopher,\
    \ and WWW clients (such as\n   Mosaic), and via online services such as Delphi\
    \ and America OnLine.\n   WAIS software includes user interfaces for most platforms,\
    \ and server\n   software that provides automatic indexing of databases.\n   WAIS\
    \ was developed by Thinking Machines Corporation of Cambridge,\n   Massachusetts\
    \ in collaboration with Apple Computer, Inc., Dow Jones &\n   Company, and KPMG\
    \ Peat Marwick.  With over 100 databases and 5,000\n   users worldwide, WAIS is\
    \ rapidly becoming a standard for information\n   distribution within the Internet\
    \ environment.\n   WAIS is a client-server application.  Most of the clients remain\n\
    \   freely available with a few exceptions.  WAIS, Inc.  develops and\n   sells\
    \ commercial versions of WAIS and the Clearinghouse for Networked\n   Information\
    \ Discovery and Retrieval (CNIDR) develops freeWAIS, a\n   version free for distribution\
    \ and use.  A few freely distributable\n   versions remain available from Thinking\
    \ Machines, Inc.  and other\n   organizations.\n   What does WAIS do?\n      WAIS\
    \ allows multimedia information to be stored anywhere on any\n      platform.\
    \  Using your interface of choice, WAIS enables you to\n      find personal, corporate\
    \ and public information.  The information\n      is accessible regardless of\
    \ format: text, formatted documents,\n      pictures, spreadsheets, graphics,\
    \ sound, or video.\n      WAIS recognizes natural language queries. The search\
    \ and retrieval\n      of relevant information is made using your native language.\
    \  To\n      date, we have used English, French, Italian, and Latin!  The most\n\
    \      relevant documents, regardless of size, can be sent back to the\n     \
    \ server in their entirety to further refine your search (telling\n      the server,\
    \ \"Find me more like this document.\") Proven searches\n      can be automatically\
    \ repeated, monitoring and alerting you to new\n      information as it becomes\
    \ available.\n   How does WAIS work?\n      WAIS uses a single computer-to-computer\
    \ protocol (NISO Z39.50-\n      1988).  Each WAIS server reads your question and\
    \ based on its\n      words, searches the full text of the database for the most\n\
    \      relevant documents, and ranks them using automatic word weighting.\n  \
    \    Servers need not fully understand your query; the retrieval\n      process\
    \ is based on a search method called relevance feedback.\n -----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\

    \ NIR Tool Name: Whois\n Brief Description of Tool:\n   As currently defined,\
    \ NICNAME/WHOIS services is a TCP transaction\n   based query/response server,\
    \ running on a few specific central\n   machines, that provides netwide directory\
    \ service to internet users.\n   Since the WHOIS service was defined in 1985,\
    \ it has evolved into a\n   distributed service.\n   The InterNIC Registration\
    \ Services is located at Network Solutions,\n   Inc., Herndon, VA, and is funded\
    \ by a cooperative agreement from the\n   National Science Foundations to provide\
    \ assistance in registering\n   networks, domains, asn's, and other entities to\
    \ the Internet\n   community via telephone, electronic mail, and U.S. postal mail.\n\
    \   Databases and information servers of interest to network users are\n   provided,\
    \ including the WHOIS registry of domains, networks, asn's\n   and their associated\
    \ poc's.  Gopher and Wais interfaces are also\n   available for retrieving information\
    \ and accessing whois.  Online\n   documents maintained at registration services\
    \ include registration\n   related rfc's, registration templates, and various\
    \ netinfo files.\n   Many of the online files are available through our automatic\
    \ mail\n   service, MAILSERV@RS.INTERNIC.NET.  Whois queries can also be\n   directed\
    \ to rs.internic.net.  From a host, use the TELNET program to\n   connect to host\
    \ RS.INTERNIC.NET.  When greeted by the Registration\n   host, type \"WHOIS\"\
    \ and press RETURN.\n   MAILSERV@RS.INTERNIC.NET is an automated service provided\
    \ by InterNIC\n   Registration Services.  It allows access to documents and information\n\
    \   via ordinary electronic mail.  This is especially useful for users\n   who\
    \ do not have access to the NIC via a direct Internet link, such as\n   users\
    \ of BITNET, CSNET and UUCP sites.\n   To use the mail service, send a mail message\
    \ to\n   MAILSERV@RS.INTERNIC.NET.  In the SUBJECT field, request the type of\n\
    \   service you wish followed by any needed arguments.  The message body\n   is\
    \ normally ignored.  Large files will be broken into smaller\n   separate messages.\
    \  The information you request will be sent back to\n   you as soon as possible.\n\
    \   WHOIS xxx       Returns information about xxx from the WHOIS service.\n  \
    \                 Use \"WHOIS HELP\" for information on how to use WHOIS.\n  \
    \ The MILNET Network Information Center, maintains the central NICNAME\n   database\
    \ and server, providing online look-up of individuals, network\n   organizations,\
    \ MILNET nodes, and other information of interest to\n   those involved in management\
    \ of the Internet.  Whois queries can be\n   sent to nic.ddn.mil.\n -----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\

    \ NIR Tool Name:            World-Wide Web\n Brief Description of Tool:\n   The\
    \ WWW project merges the techniques of networked information and\n   hypertext\
    \ to make an easy but powerful global information system.  W3\n   uses the concept\
    \ of a seamless information space (the \"web\"), in\n   which all objects including\
    \ those accessed by earlier protocols\n   (wais, gopher, ftp, etc.) exist.\n \
    \  The project allows information sharing within internationally\n   dispersed\
    \ teams, and the dissemination of information by support\n   groups.  Originally\
    \ aimed at the High Energy Physics community, it\n   has spread to other areas\
    \ and attracted much interest in user\n   support, resource discovery and collaborative\
    \ work areas.  It is\n   currently the most advanced information system deployed\
    \ on the\n   Internet.\n   READER VIEW\n      The WWW world consists of documents,\
    \ and links.  Indexes are\n      special documents which, rather than being read,\
    \ may be searched.\n      The result of such a search is another (\"virtual\"\
    ) document\n      containing links to the documents found.  A simple protocol\
    \ (\"\n      HTTP \") is used to allow a browser program to request a keyword\n\
    \      search by a remote information server.\n      The web contains documents\
    \ in many formats.  Those documents which\n      are hypertext, (real or virtual)\
    \ contain links to other documents,\n      or places within documents.  All documents,\
    \ whether real, virtual\n      or indexes, look similar to the reader and are\
    \ contained within\n      the same addressing scheme.\n      To follow a link,\
    \ a reader clicks with a mouse (or types in a\n      number if he or she has no\
    \ mouse).  To search and index, a reader\n      gives keywords (or other search\
    \ criteria).  These are the only\n      operations necessary to access the entire\
    \ world of data.\n   INFORMATION PROVIDER VIEW\n      The WWW browsers can access\
    \ many existing data systems via\n      existing protocols (FTP, NNTP) or via\
    \ HTTP and a gateway.  In this\n      way, the critical mass of data is quickly\
    \ exceeded, and the\n      increasing use of the system by readers and information\
    \ suppliers\n      encourage each other.\n      Providing information is as simple\
    \ as running the W3 server and\n      pointing it at an existing directory structure.\
    \  The server\n      automatically generates the hypertext view of your files\
    \ to guide\n      the user around.\n      To personalize it, you can write a few\
    \ SGML hypertext files to\n      give an even more friendly view.  Also, any file\
    \ available by\n      anonymous FTP, or any internet newsgroup can be immediately\
    \ linked\n      into the web.  The very small start-up effort is designed to allow\n\
    \      small contributions.  At the other end of the scale, large\n      information\
    \ providers may provide an HTTP server with full text or\n      keyword indexing.\
    \  This may allow access to a large existing\n      database without changing\
    \ the way that database is managed.  Such\n      gateways have already been made\
    \ into Oracle(tm), WAIS, and\n      Digital's VMS/Help systems, to name but a\
    \ few.\n      The WWW model gets over the frustrating incompatibilities of data\n\
    \      format between suppliers and reader by allowing negotiation of\n      format\
    \ between a smart browser and a smart server.  This should\n      provide a basis\
    \ for extension into multimedia, and allow those who\n      share application\
    \ standards to make full use of them across the\n      web.\n      This summary\
    \ does not describe the many exciting possibilities\n      opened up by the WWW\
    \ project, such as efficient document caching.\n      The reduction of redundant\
    \ out-of-date copies, and the use of\n      knowledge daemons.  There is more\
    \ information in the online\n      project documentation, including some background\
    \ on hypertext and\n      many technical notes.\n   GETTING STARTED\n      You\
    \ can bootstrap yourself into the web by telnetting to\n      info.cern.ch (no\
    \ user or password). You can try a full screen\n      interface \"Lynx\" by telnetting\
    \ to ukanaix.cc.ukans.edu, login in\n      as \"www\".  You can also find out\
    \ more about WWW in this way.\n      These are the least sophisticated browsers\
    \ -- remember that the\n      window-oriented ones are much smarter!  It is much\
    \ more efficient\n      to install a browser on your own machine, and you have\
    \ many more\n      facilities.\n      If you have an X-windows based workstation,\
    \ PC or Mac just FTP to\n      FTP.NCSA.UIUC.EDU and get the binary of NCSA's\
    \ \"Mosaic\" browser in\n      directory /Web/Mosaic-binaries. Download it, uncompress\
    \ it, set it\n      executable, and run it.  It will tell you all you need to\
    \ know.\n      Mosaic is now available for PCs and Apple Macs.\n      If you have\
    \ an MSDOS machine with Windows, you could try the\n      \"Cello\" browser from\
    \ FATTY.LAW.CORNELL.EDU in directory\n      /pub/LII/Cello.\n      The line mode\
    \ browser is currently available in source form by\n      anonymous FTP from node\
    \ info.cern.ch [currently 128.141.201.74] if\n      you take both files\n    \
    \            /pub/www/src/WWWLibrary_v.vv.tar.Z.\n                /pub/www/src/WWWLineMode_v.vv.tar.Z.\n\
    \      (v.vv is the version number - take the latest.)\n   Also available is a\
    \ hypertext editor for the NeXT (in\n   /pub/www/bin/next), the MidasWWW and ViolaWWW\
    \ browsers for X11, an\n   alpha-test Mac browser, and and a basic server\n  \
    \ (/pub/www/src/WWWDaemon_v.vv.tar.Z).  Documentation, including the\n   latest\
    \ list of software available , is readable using www.  A plain\n   text version\
    \ of the installation instructions is included in the tar\n   file!\n   Printable\
    \ (postscript) documentation and articles are in /pub/www/doc\n   on info.cern.ch.\n\

    \ X.500 White Pages\n  Date completed or updated: 10 March, 1994\n  By: Name:\
    \          Chris Weider\n      Email address: clw@bunyip.com\n -----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\
    \ NIR Tool Name: X.500\n Brief Description of Tool:\n   X.500 is an international\
    \ standard designed to provide a distributed\n   global directory service.  It\
    \ is primarily used today to provide\n   'White Pages' services, although other\
    \ types of services which have\n   directory components (automated mail aliasing,\
    \ for example) are\n   beginning to be run over X.500.  In addition to information\
    \ about\n   people and organizations, the Directory also contains a pilot K-12\n\
    \   Directory, pilot Information Resource information, and some other\n   non-White\
    \ Pages information.  X.500 contains a number of security\n   features, which\
    \ are implemented on different paradigms in the various\n   servers.\n   User's\
    \ View:\n      Users (either human or electronic) run a client program to connect\n\
    \      to a local X.500 server.  Since X.500 is distributed, it appears\n    \
    \  that the entire global X.500 directory is available from the local\n      server.\
    \  From this server connection, the user can add, delete, or\n      modify information\
    \ held by the Directory, or issue powerful search\n      commands to locate individuals\
    \ or other information.\n      The first solid version of the X.500 protocol was\
    \ released in\n      1988, and has been the subject of much research in the past\
    \ 5\n      years.  Consequently, there are a large number of clients, for\n  \
    \    almost every platform, and a healthy number of servers.  There are\n    \
    \  mail interfaces to some parts of the X.500 directory, and there is\n      a\
    \ X.500 to Gopher gateway.  An X.500 interface to archie is\n      currently under\
    \ development, as well as an X.500 to WWW interface.\n   Information Provider's\
    \ View:\n      X.500 provides a set of mechanisms to allow distributed location\n\
    \      of, maintenance of, and access to a large set of data.  However,\n    \
    \  current servers force a hierarchical view on the location of the\n      data,\
    \ so it may not be suitable for all applications.  Also, the\n      X.500 directory\
    \ is today unable to provide access to information\n      at a rate which would\
    \ allow 'real-time' applications (such as\n      keeping routing information in\
    \ the directory).\n      Also, there is a great effort underway to reduce the\
    \ startup costs\n      of X.500 access by providing a lightweight X.500 access\
    \ protocol\n      for client-server applications.  This work is detailed in RFC\n\
    \      1487:\n      \"Lightweight Directory Access Protocol\", by Yeong, Howes,\
    \ and\n      Kille.  This protocol is expected to make the cost of entry for a\n\
    \      service provider much less that it has been.\n   Information Types Supported:\n\
    \      X.500 allows information to be served in an attribute:value\n      paradigm,\
    \ with related attributes grouped into 'objects'. Each\n      entry in the directory\
    \ can be described by multiple objects.\n      Attributes can have values which\
    \ are text strings, dereferenceable\n      file names, or text-encoded photographs,\
    \ and experimentation is\n      underway to keep digitally encoded sounds in the\
    \ directory.\n -----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\

    \ group:\n   The Coalition for Networked Information was founded in March 1990\
    \ to\n   help realize the promise of high performance networks and computers\n\
    \   for the advancement of scholarship and the enrichment of intellectual\n  \
    \ productivity.  The Coalition is a partnership of the Association of\n   Research\
    \ Libraries (ARL), CAUSE, and EDUCOM.  ARL is dedicated to\n   equitable access\
    \ to, and effective use of, recorded knowlege in\n   support of teaching, research,\
    \ scholarship, and community service,\n   and CAUSE and EDUCOM are dedicated to\
    \ different aspects of the\n   introduction, use, and management of information\
    \ technology and\n   related resources in research and education in general and\
    \ higher\n   education in particular.  The Coalition pursues its mission with\
    \ the\n   assistance of a task force that provides a common vehicle by which\n\
    \   more than 190 institutions and organizations are exploring a shared\n   vision\
    \ of how information management must change in the 1990s to meet\n   the social\
    \ and economic opportunities and challenges of the 21st\n   century.  Members\
    \ of the Coalition Task Force include, among others,\n   higher education institutions,\
    \ publishers, network service providers,\n   computer hardware, software, and\
    \ systems companies, library networks\n   and organizations, and public and state\
    \ libraries. A truly diverse\n   collaboration of institutions and organizations.\n\

    \ main group:\n   (from ARL Newsletter #164 -- September 9, 1992)\n      The Coalition's\
    \ TopNode Project is creating a directory of\n      directories, catalogs and\
    \ aids of networked information resources,\n      services and tools.  The project\
    \ is intended to facilitate the\n      network navigational duties, responsibilities\
    \ and tasks of staff\n      in libraries, computer centers, networking offices\
    \ and other\n      similar operations.  The primary product of the TopNode project\n\
    \      will be a set of records describing these networked information\n     \
    \ resources, records that can be loaded into a wide range of\n      database management\
    \ systems.\n      Based on their response to a Call for Statements of Interest\
    \ and\n      Experience, Indiana University and Merit Network, Inc.  were\n  \
    \    chosen to lead the development effort on the Coalition TopNode\n      project.\
    \  Pete Percival, Manager, Academic Information Environment\n      at Indiana\
    \ University and Craig Summerhill, Coalition Systems\n      Coordinator, have\
    \ completed the design for the database structure\n      which is being built\
    \ on the Coalition's Internet fileserver using\n      BRS/SEARCH.  Based on earlier\
    \ work of the leaders of the\n      Directories and Resource Information Services\
    \ Working Group,\n      George Brett II of the University of North Carolina General\n\
    \      Administration and Peggy Seiden of Skidmore College Library,\n      Percival\
    \ and Summerhill have developed a data structure that they\n      believe to be\
    \ both flexible and responsive to the needs of the\n      many interested parties\
    \ who have been consulted.\n      Under the direction of Gary Charbonneau of the\
    \ Indiana University\n      Libraries, records are being created and prepared\
    \ for loading.  A\n      thesaurus of added descriptor terms is being maintained.\
    \  As of\n      mid-August 1992, close to 200 records had been verified and had\n\
    \      received descriptive cataloging.\n      When the database is complete,\
    \ libraries will be alerted and\n      encouraged to mount the TopNode records\
    \ into their online\n      catalogs.  Records will be available from the Coalition.\
    \  In\n      addition, MERIT will use the TopNode database in an experiment to\n\
    \      test the viability of the X.500 directory format standard for\n      providing\
    \ yellow pages-type services (e.g., with subject access).\n      After its initial\
    \ release, the database will be maintained by\n      Indiana University libraries\
    \ on the Coalition server; BRS has\n      assisted in the development of procedures\
    \ for online data entry.\n -----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\

    \ subgroup:\n    Mailinglist-Address:\n Description of main group:\n  Several\
    \ user-friendly client-server software tools have  been\n  developed recently\
    \ for locating and retrieving information\n  published on computer platforms reachable\
    \ over wide-area data\n  communications networks like the Internet. Among them,\
    \ freeWAIS\n  (freely available wide-area information system), the Internet\n\
    \  Gopher, archie, and the WorldWide Web (WWW) have become popular.\n  freeWAIS,\
    \ archie, and Gopher indicate where information of\n  interest is likely to reside\
    \ and then assist the user in locating\n  specific information. WWW permits a\
    \ user to thread a path through\n  the network by selecting tagged hypertext items.\n\
    \  While focused on the evolution of wide-area information retrieval\n  systems,\
    \ the Clearinghouse for Networked Information Discovery\n  and Retrieval (CNIDR)\
    \ works closely with developers of other\n  tools toward providing compatibility,\
    \ consistency, and, to the\n  extent possible, convergence of the tools.\n  Specific\
    \ activities are to provide a central focus and forum for\n  networked information\
    \ discovery and retrieval (NIDR) tools and to\n  minimize the divergence of individual\
    \ implementations by\n  providing a repository for the collection, evaluation,\
    \ and\n  distribution of protocol-compliant releases and enhanced\n  versions.\n\
    \  CNIDR participates in standards and policy associations such as\n  the Internet\
    \ Engineering Task Force and the Coalition for\n  Networked Information, with\
    \ the goal of increasing consensus\n  among developers and exploring appropriate\
    \ uses of networked\n  information. CNIDR also actively promotes the use of networked\n\
    \  information discovery and retrieval tools at many national and\n  international\
    \ conferences to inform and educate implementors and\n  end users.\n -----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\

    \ NIR Group Name:    Uniform Resource Identifiers (uri)\n Sponsoring Organisation:\
    \ Internet Engineering Task Forces (IETF)\n Working subgroups:    NONE\n Description\
    \ of main group:\n   The Uniform Resource Identifiers Archives Working Group is\
    \ chartered\n   to define a set of standards for the encoding of system independent\n\
    \   Resource Location and Identification information for the use of\n   Internet\
    \ information services.  There are three classes of\n   information being standardized\
    \ in this group:\n      1)  Uniform Resource Locators (URLs), which specify a\
    \ standardized\n          method for encoding location and access information\
    \ to\n          resources across multiple information systems,\n      2)  Uniform\
    \ Resource Names (URNs), which specify a standardized\n          method for encoding\
    \ a unique resource identifier for a given\n          content, and\n      3) \
    \ Uniform Resource Citations (URCs), which specify a\n          standardized method\
    \ for encoding information about a given\n          instantiation of a content.\n\
    \   The URLs allow an information service to give a user access and\n   location\
    \ information for a resource.  The URN allows an information\n   service to determine\
    \ if the contents of two information resources are\n   the same or not.  The URC\
    \ allows an information service to select\n   which of a number of different encodings\
    \ of a resource are\n   appropriate for a given user's retrieval capabilities,\
    \ and may\n   contain such things as file size and compression techniques.\n \
    \  Membership is open, and is not limited to IETF attendees.  A full\n   charter\

    \ of main group:\n This description is the current WNILS-WG charter.\n   The Network\
    \ Information Center (NIC) maintains the central NICNAME\n   database and server,\
    \ defined in RFC 954, providing online look-up of\n   individuals, network organizations,\
    \ key nodes, and other information\n   of interest to those who use the Internet.\
    \  Other distributed\n   directory information servers and information retrieval\
    \ tools have\n   been developed and it is anticipated more will be created.  Many\n\
    \   sites now maintain local directory servers with information about\n   individuals,\
    \ departments and services at that specific site.\n   Typically these directory\
    \ servers are network accessible.  Because\n   these servers are local, there\
    \ are now wide variations in the type of\n   data stored, access methods, search\
    \ schemes, and user interfaces.\n   The purpose of the Whois and Network Information\
    \ Lookup Service\n   (WNILS) working group is to expand and define the standard\
    \ for WHOIS\n   services, to resolve issues associated with the variations in\
    \ access\n   and to promote a consistent and predictable service across the\n\
    \   network.\n Goals and Milestones:\n  Done    Review and approve the charter\
    \ making any changes deemed\n          necessary. Examine the particular functional\
    \ needs for\n          expanded whois directory service. Begin work on a framework\n\
    \          for recommendations.  Assign writing assignments for first\n      \
    \    draft of document.\n  12/1/93 Submit the Whois and Network Information Lookup\
    \ Service\n          Recommendations document to the IESG as an Internet Draft.\n\
    \  12/1/93 Submit the WHOIS++ protocol document to the IESG as an\n          Internet\
    \ Draft.\n  12/1/93 Submit the \"Architecture of the Whois++ Index Service\"\n\
    \          document to the IESG as a revised Internet Draft.\n  12/1/93 Freeze\
    \ all work on the Internet Drafts for 6 months for\n          software development.\n\

    \               Discovery and Directory Service (IRTF-RD)\n Sponsoring Organisation:\
    \ Internet Society\n Working subgroups: None\n Description of main group:\n  The\
    \ IRTF-RD group is focused on problems of scale that will arise in\n  resource\
    \ discovery systems in the next 3-5 years.  We divide these\n  scaling problems\
    \ into three dimensions: volume of information, size of\n  the user base, and\
    \ information diversity.\n  Our goal is to explore techniques for dealing with\
    \ these problems\n  through a set of interrelated prototypes demonstrating advances\
    \ in\n  each of these dimensions.  Briefly, our current approaches are:\n    \
    \ - deal with information diversity through a coordinated set\n       of techniques\
    \ to gather, transform, and manage entropy of data\n     - deal with user scale\
    \ through large scale replication\n     - deal with information volume using a\
    \ combination of\n       views, space efficient indexing, and customization w.r.t.\n\
    \       vocabulary, search methods, and personal user history\n  We expect these\
    \ approaches to evolve significantly over time.\n  Membership of this group is\
    \ closed.  We will consider new members,\n  with two constraints.  First, the\
    \ group must be kept small and focused\n  to make substantive progress - at most\
    \ 4 or 5 members seems\n  appropriate at this time.  Second, prospective members\
    \ must be active\n  resource discovery researchers, who will bring clear strengths\
    \ to the\n  group.  Prospective members should send a vitae and a one page\n \
    \ position paper describing what they propose to do to advance the\n  group's\
    \ efforts, addressed to the group chair.\n  The group currently consists of:\n\

    \ Group name: Z39.50 Implementors Group\n Description of main group:\n   The Z39.50\
    \ Implementors group (ZIG) is a volunteer organization\n   consisting of representatives\
    \ of most of the organizations in the\n   United States and Canada that are actively\
    \ engaged in implementing\n   the Z39.50 protocol.  This includes the United States\
    \ Library of\n   Congress, The National Library of Canada, the major bibliographic\n\
    \   utilities, many library automation vendors, and other information\n   service\
    \ providers.  The group is a volunteer effort whose meetings\n   are open at no\
    \ charge to all.  The group meets about 3 times a year\n   and conducts its activities\
    \ extensively on its mailing list which is\n   also open to any interested party.\n\
    \   The group was originally formed to deal with interoperability issues\n   among\
    \ the Z39.50 implementations that were beginning to emerge in\n   1989 and 1990\
    \ but the group has since expanded its role and has now\n   become the primary\
    \ forum in which new features and versions of the\n   Z39.50 are developed.\n\

    \ Other Information:\n Brief Description of the Z39.50 Protocol\n   Z39.50 is\
    \ a US ANSI standard protocol for information retrieval.  It\n   uses a client\
    \ server model that allows clients ( or origins in Z39.50\n   terminology) to\
    \ search servers (targets in Z39.50 usage) and retrieve\n   records from remote\
    \ databases.  The type and format of the data\n   retrieved is not constrained\
    \ by the protocol but is agreed to by the\n   origin and the target.  There is\
    \ a mechanism that allows popular\n   record syntax's to be registered and then\
    \ referred to by well known\n   identifiers.  Z39.50 is an OSI application layer\
    \ protocol; that is,\n   it is designed to make use of the OSI presentation layer\
    \ protocol.\n   It may be used with or without the presentation protocol, and\
    \ below\n   that, it is irrelevant (to the Z39.50 protocol) what protocols are\n\
    \   used.  Most implementations of Z39.50 currently run directly over\n   TCP/IP.\n\
    \ User's View:\n   Users (either human or electronic) run client software to connect\n\
    \   with servers to retrieve information using the Z39.50 protocol.  Many\n  \
    \ clients already exist at least in prototype version today and more\n   are being\
    \ written.  Most of the major library automation vendors have\n   announced that\
    \ they will be supporting Z39.50 in either client or\n   server mode or both.\
    \  Many of the major information vendors either\n   currently have or are working\
    \ on implementations of Z39.50 for their\n   systems.  There are also a couple\
    \ of Z39.50 implementations that are\n   expected to be put in the public domain\
    \ at some point.  The recently\n   announced FREEWAIS software incorporates Z39.50\
    \ Version 2 into it\n   (the older version used a variant of the 1988 version\
    \ 1 protocol).\n   The Library of Congress acts as the maintenance agency for\
    \ Z39.50 and\n   can be contacted for a list of registered Implementors.\n   Z39.50\
    \ provides a protocol mechanism for accessing remote information\n   sources.\
    \  It defines the model for the interaction between two sides,\n   a client and\
    \ a server.  It makes no assumptions or presumptions about\n   how the data is\
    \ actually organized in the server, nor about how the\n   data is presented to\
    \ the end user by the client.\n   The model postulates one or more databases on\
    \ the remote system that\n   can be searched using attributes from defined search\
    \ attribute sets,\n   creating a result set.  Records can be retrieved from the\
    \ result set\n   using agreed upon record formats.\n Information types supported:\n\
    \   The Z39.50 protocol was designed as a general purpose search and\n   retrieval\
    \ mechanism that could be used with a wide variety of data\n   types.  The MARC\
    \ format (a format used for cataloging library\n   material among other things)\
    \ and a search attribute set suitable for\n   bibliographic and similar types\
    \ of data are registered within the\n   current version of the standard.  It is\
    \ assumed that, as the protocol\n   begins to be used by other communities and\
    \ for other types of data,\n   other attribute sets and record syntaxes will be\
    \ developed.  This\n   process has already begun and a generic record syntax and\
    \ attribute\n   set are already under development, as well as some others,\n \
    \  specifically those supporting chemical structures, general science\n   and\
    \ technology, and business information.  The design philosophy\n   behind Z39.50\
    \ is that it will be used with other standards such as\n   Postscript, SGML, ODIF\
    \ (and others), to communicate a wide variety of\n   data types, including full\
    \ text, images, and many others.\n =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=\n\

    \ Advisory Group\n Working subgroups:  None\n Description of main group:\n  OCLC\
    \ and the Library of Congress have formed a working group to\n  consider how libraries\
    \ can create cataloging records for online\n  information resources.  The group\
    \ initiated a cataloging experiment\n  designed to test and verify the applicability\
    \ of the cataloging rules\n  and the USMARC format for computer files.  Guidelines\
    \ have been\n  written for cataloging Internet resources and were considered by\
    \ the\n  American Library Association committee responsible for maintaining the\n\
    \  Anglo- American Cataloging Rules.  Changes to the USMARC format were\n  initiated\
    \ to accommodate a subset of these materials (electronic data\n  resources, such\
    \ as software, electronic text, bibliographic and\n  nonbibliographic databases).\
    \  USMARC format changes which were\n  approved included an identification of\
    \ type of file and a field for\n  location and access of the resource (very much\
    \ like a URL).\n  The group is continuing its work by looking at how online systems\
    \ and\n  services can be accommodated in USMARC.  This work will be done within\n\
    \  the USMARC Advisory Group of the American Library Association, which\n  considers\
    \ changes to the USMARC formats.  Data elements will be\n  defined with mapping\
    \ to MARC fields; in some cases new fields will be\n  proposed.  This will be\
    \ accomplished in conjunction with efforts by\n  other working groups (e.g., Government\
    \ Information Locator Service, or\n  GILS).\n  A proposal was presented and approved\
    \ in February 1994 to the USMARC\n  Advisory Group to add data elements to the\
    \ Electronic Location and\n  Access Field (USMARC field 856).  Included among\
    \ these was a subfield\n  for URL (Uniform Resource Locator).  It is intended\
    \ to be used instead\n  of or in addition to other data identifying location of\
    \ and access to\n  a networked information resource.\n  Membership is closed at\
    \ this point.\n -----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\

    \ time to submit and update descriptions of their NIR tools\n   and groups; their\
    \ names are included in the templates in Sections 6\n   and 7.\n   Before final\
    \ submission of the report as an RFC, independent\n   reviewers from around the\

    \ NIR Tool Name: Hyper-G\n Brief Description of Tool:\n  Hyper-G is the name of\
    \ an ambitious hypermedia project currently being\n  developed as a joint effort\
    \ by a number of institutes of the IIG\n  (Institutes for Information-Processing\
    \ Graz) and the Computing and\n  Information Services Center of the Graz University\
    \ of Technology and\n  the Austrian Computer Society.\n  Hyper-G is designed as\
    \ a general-purpose, large-scale, multi-user,\n  distributed hypermedia information\
    \ system.  As such, it combines\n  concepts of hypermedia, information retrieval\
    \ systems, documentation\n  systems with aspects of communication and collaboration,\
    \ and computer\n  supported teaching and learning.  It also provides seamless\n\
    \  integration of other systems (e.g., World-Wide Web, Gopher, WAIS) that\n  also\
    \ operate under the client/server paradigm and allows remote logins\n  to interactive\
    \ services.\n  In addition to hypertext links, Hyper-G allows navigation through\n\
    \  hierarchies, queries (including full text), guided tours, and is\n  multilingual.\n\
    \  Hyper-G is currently operated at some 10 locations throughout the\n  world,\
    \ including a University Information System at the Graz Technical\n  University.\
    \  Clients and the server are available without fee for\n  educational institutions,\
    \ and are distributed as binaries for a number\n  of platforms.\n -----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\

    \ NIR Tool Name:    SoftPages\n Brief Description of Tool:\n  A tool to aid users\
    \ in the efficient retrieval of documents, s/w, and\n  the like from servers (\
    \ anonymous FTP, FTAM, ..  ) connected to the\n  network.  In principle, it uses\
    \ the X.500 Directory framework to store\n  information about the network.  This\
    \ includes the network\n  configuration, the properties of the links that connect\
    \ the network\n  elements, location of servers and their contents.  When a user\
    \ looks\n  for a particular document or s/w the above information is used to\n\
    \  search for the object starting from the server that is\n  \"nearest\" (cheapest)\
    \ to the user.\n  The X.500 directory services is used in several stages\n   \
    \    get list of file-servers\n       get path to file servers\n       get attributes\
    \ for computing cost of paths\n       search for file that is being sought\n \
    \ However, under present circumstances, due to lack of deployment of\n  network\
    \ information in the directory, when information is unavailable\n  from X.500,\
    \ alternate sources/methods are used.  [Static-lists of\n  file-servers, or lists\
    \ of file servers from other clients (e.g.,\n  archie); Paths and/or costs are\
    \ obtained from static lists or derived\n  by other direct means (e.g., ping,\
    \ traceroute); file information is\n  sought from other servers (e.g., archie).]\n\
    \  User's View:\n  A \"single window\" view of the public archives connected to\
    \ the\n  network.  It locates the server that contains the sought object and is\n\
    \  near(/cheap/fast) server.\n  Query of files based on incomplete name is supported.\
    \  The system also\n  supports queries based on keywords.\n  Information Provider's\
    \ View:\n  The information about the server contents have to be updated\n  at\
    \ a single place- namely, the local Directory Service Agent.\n  The Directory\
    \ Service Agent makes the information globally\n  accessible.\n  It is not necessary\
    \ to carry out periodic updates on one or\n  more information servers.\n  - information\
    \ types supported (e.g., text, sound, etc.)\n  Since the system supports query\
    \ on name and keywords (not on\n  contents) all kinds of information may be supported.\n\

    \ NIR Tool Name: whois++ and the whois++ index service\n Brief Description of\
    \ Tool:\n  whois++ and the whois++ index service are extensions of the WHOIS\n\
    \  protocol.  They are designed to a) subsume in a standardized fashion\n  the\
    \ many enhancements which have been added to individual WHOIS\n  servers; b) extend\
    \ the flexibility of WHOIS by enriching the query\n  syntax, and c) provide a\
    \ distributed indexing system to tie the\n  various whois++ servers into a distributed\
    \ information lookup service.\n  The protocols describe two logically distinct\
    \ types of servers that an\n  information provider can set up.  The first type\
    \ is the base-level\n  whois++ server.  This contains primary information, such\
    \ as entries\n  for individual people or entries describing resources available\n\
    \  locally.  For example, if one wished to provide a campus directory\n  through\
    \ whois++, one would set up a base-level whois++ server that\n  contained entries\
    \ for each student.  In addition, this base-level\n  server must be able to generate\
    \ 'forward knowledge' for the\n  information it contains.  The second type of\
    \ server collects the\n  'forward knowledge' generated by a number of base-level\
    \ servers, and\n  can take a query sent to it and determine which of the base-level\n\
    \  servers it indexes might contain information relevant for the query.\n  A single\
    \ physical server may contain both primary information and\n  'forward knowledge'\
    \ for a number of other servers, and an index server\n  can also index 'forward\
    \ knowledge' for a number of other index\n  servers, allowing a hierarchical mesh\
    \ of index servers to be built.\n  For more details on the information provider's\
    \ point of view, see the\n  'Documentation' section of this template.\n  The basic\
    \ information model is centered on the concept of 'templates'.\n  A template is\
    \ a collection of attribute:value pairs, where the\n  allowable attributes are\
    \ specified by the template type.  The whois++\n  templates are based on the templates\
    \ defined by the IAFA working group\n  of the IETF.  The values associated with\
    \ given attributes are not\n  necessarily limited to text, they can be digitized\
    \ sound clips, etc.\n  Depending on the client she uses, the user will see a connection\
    \ to\n  the local whois++ base-level server.  The user can ask the server for\n\
    \  a list of templates supported by that server, and can then call up a\n  blank\
    \ version of the template so that she can fill in values for the\n  attributes\
    \ she knows.  Once she has filled in the template as much as\n  she wants, she\
    \ issues a query to the server to find all the entries\n  which have these attribute:value\
    \ pairs.  If she is not satisfied with\n  the responses, she can then start traversing\
    \ the index service to\n  locate a server which can adequately answer her query.\
    \  In addition,\n  if a user makes frequent use of the index service, she can\
    \ set\n  'bookmarks' which can be used later to directly contact servers she's\n\
    \  found useful in the past, without having to traverse the index service\n  again.\n\
