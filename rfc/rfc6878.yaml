  - "1.  Introduction\n   This document defines a new IANA registry to keep track
    of the values\n   defined for the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) \"Priority\"
    header\n   field.  This header field was defined in [RFC3261], Section 20.26.\n
    \  It was clearly specified in a way that allows for the creation of new\n   values
    beyond those originally specified; however, no registry has\n   been established
    for it.\n"

  - "2.  IANA Considerations\n   This document adds a new sub-registry, \"Priority
    Header Field\n   Values\", to the \"Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Parameters\"\n
    \  registry page.  Its format and initial values are as shown in the\n   following
    table:\n                        +------------+-----------+\n                        |
    Priority   | Reference |\n                        +------------+-----------+\n
    \                       | non-urgent | RFC 3261  |\n                        |
    normal     | RFC 3261  |\n                        | urgent     | RFC 3261  |\n
    \                       | emergency  | RFC 3261  |\n                        +------------+-----------+\n
    \  The policy for registration of values in this registry is \"IETF\n   Review\"
    as that term is defined by [RFC5226].  This policy was chosen\n   over lighter-weight
    policies due the potential architectural impact\n   of the semantics associated
    with new values.  Efforts contemplating\n   adding a Priority value should consider
    whether the SIP Resource-\n   Priority [RFC4412] or even a different protocol
    would be more\n   appropriate for achieving their requirements.\n"
