- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   The ICNRG charter identifies deployment guidelines as an\
    \ important\n   topic area for the ICN community.  Specifically, the charter states\n\
    \   that defining concrete migration paths for ICN deployments that avoid\n  \
    \ forklift upgrades and defining practical ICN interworking\n   configurations\
    \ with the existing Internet paradigm are key topic\n   areas that require further\
    \ investigation [ICNRGCharter].  Also, it is\n   well understood that results\
    \ and conclusions from any mid- to large-\n   scale ICN experiments in the live\
    \ Internet will also provide useful\n   guidance for deployments.\n   So far,\
    \ outside of some preliminary investigations, such as\n   [ICN-DEP-CON], there\
    \ has not been much progress on this topic.  This\n   document attempts to fill\
    \ some of these gaps by defining clear\n   deployment configurations for ICN and\
    \ associated migration pathways\n   for these configurations.  Also, selected\
    \ deployment trial\n   experiences of ICN technology are summarized.  Recommendations\
    \ are\n   also made for potential future IETF standardization of key protocol\n\
    \   functionality that will facilitate interoperable ICN deployments\n   going\
    \ forward.\n   The major configurations of possible ICN deployments are identified\n\
    \   in this document as (1) Clean-slate ICN replacement of existing\n   Internet\
    \ infrastructure, (2) ICN-as-an-Overlay, (3) ICN-as-an-\n   Underlay, (4) ICN-as-a-Slice,\
    \ and (5) Composite-ICN.  Existing ICN\n   trial systems primarily fall under\
    \ the ICN-as-an-Overlay, ICN-as-an-\n   Underlay, and Composite-ICN configurations.\
    \  Each of these deployment\n   configurations have their respective strengths\
    \ and weaknesses.  This\n   document will aim to provide guidance for current\
    \ and future members\n   of the ICN community when they consider deployment of\
    \ ICN\n   technologies.\n   This document represents the consensus of the Information-Centric\n\
    \   Networking Research Group (ICNRG).  It has been reviewed extensively\n   by\
    \ the Research Group (RG) members active in the specific areas of\n   work covered\
    \ by the document.\n"
- title: 2.  Terminology
  contents:
  - "2.  Terminology\n   This document assumes readers are, in general, familiar with\
    \ the\n   terms and concepts that are defined in [RFC7927] and [ICN-TERM].  In\n\
    \   addition, this document defines the following terminology:\n   Deployment:\n\
    \      The final stage of the process of setting up an ICN network that\n    \
    \  is (1) ready for useful work (e.g., transmission of end-user video\n      and\
    \ text) in a live environment and (2) integrated and\n      interoperable with\
    \ the Internet.  We consider the Internet in its\n      widest sense where it\
    \ encompasses various access networks (e.g.,\n      Wi-Fi or mobile radio network),\
    \ service edge networks (e.g., for\n      edge computing), transport networks,\
    \ Content Distribution Networks\n      (CDNs), core networks (e.g., mobile core\
    \ network), and back-end\n      processing networks (e.g., data centers).  However,\
    \ throughout\n      this document, the discussion is typically limited to edge\n\

    \ Networking (ICN):\n      A data-centric network architecture where accessing\
    \ data by name\n      is the essential network primitive.  See [ICN-TERM] for\
    \ further\n      information.\n   Network Functions Virtualization (NFV):\n  \
    \    A networking approach where network functions (e.g., firewalls or\n     \
    \ load balancers) are modularized as software logic that can run on\n      general\
    \ purpose hardware and, thus, are specifically decoupled\n      from the previous\
    \ generation of proprietary and dedicated\n      hardware.  See [RFC8568] for\
    \ further information.\n   Software-Defined Networking (SDN):\n      A networking\
    \ approach where the control and data planes for\n      switches are separated,\
    \ allowing for realizing capabilities, such\n      as traffic isolation and programmable\
    \ forwarding actions.  See\n      [RFC7426] for further information.\n"

  - "4.  Deployment Configurations\n   In this section, we present various deployment\
    \ options for ICN.\n   These are presented as \"configurations\" that allow for\
    \ studying these\n   options further.  While this document will outline experiences\
    \ with a\n   number of these configurations (in Section 6), we will not provide\
    \ an\n   in-depth technical or commercial evaluation for any of them -- for\n\
    \   this, we refer to existing literature in this space, such as\n   [Tateson].\n"
- title: 4.1.  Clean-Slate ICN
  contents:
  - "4.1.  Clean-Slate ICN\n   ICN has often been described as a \"clean-slate\" approach\
    \ with the\n   goal to renew or replace the complete IP infrastructure of the\n\
    \   Internet.  As such, existing routing hardware and ancillary services,\n  \
    \ such as existing applications that are typically tied directly to the\n   TCP/IP\
    \ stack, are not taken for granted.  For instance, a Clean-slate\n   ICN deployment\
    \ would see existing IP routers being replaced by ICN-\n   specific forwarding\
    \ and routing elements, such as NFD [NFD], CCNx\n   routers [Jacobson], or Publish-Subscribe\
    \ Internet Technology\n   (PURSUIT) forwarding nodes [IEEE_Communications].\n\
    \   While such clean-slate replacement could be seen as exclusive for ICN\n  \
    \ deployments, some ICN approaches (e.g., [POINT]) also rely on the\n   deployment\
    \ of general infrastructure upgrades, in this case, SDN\n   switches.  Different\
    \ proposals have been made for various ICN\n   approaches to enable the operation\
    \ over an SDN transport [Reed]\n   [CONET] [C_FLOW].\n"
- title: 4.2.  ICN-as-an-Overlay
  contents:
  - "4.2.  ICN-as-an-Overlay\n   Similar to other significant changes to the Internet\
    \ routing fabric,\n   particularly the transition from IPv4 to IPv6 or the introduction\
    \ of\n   IP multicast, this deployment configuration foresees the creation of\n\
    \   an ICN overlay.  Note that this overlay approach is sometimes,\n   informally,\
    \ also referred to as a tunneling approach.  The overlay\n   approach can be implemented\
    \ directly (e.g., ICN-over-UDP), as\n   described in [CCNx_UDP].  Alternatively,\
    \ the overlay can be\n   accomplished via ICN-in-L2-in-IP as in [IEEE_Communications],\
    \ which\n   describes a recursive layering process.  Another approach used in\
    \ the\n   Network of Information (NetInf) is to define a convergence layer to\n\
    \   map NetInf semantics to HTTP [NetInf].  Finally, [Overlay_ICN]\n   describes\
    \ an incremental approach to deploying an ICN architecture\n   particularly well\
    \ suited to SDN-based networks by also segregating\n   ICN user- and control-plane\
    \ traffic.\n   However, regardless of the flavor, the overlay approach results\
    \ in\n   islands of ICN deployments over existing IP-based infrastructure.\n \
    \  Furthermore, these ICN islands are typically connected to each other\n   via\
    \ ICN/IP tunnels.  In certain scenarios, this requires\n   interoperability between\
    \ existing IP routing protocols (e.g., OSPF,\n   RIP, or IS-IS) and ICN-based\
    \ ones.  ICN-as-an-Overlay can be deployed\n   over the IP infrastructure in either\
    \ edge or core networks.  This\n   overlay approach is thus very attractive for\
    \ ICN experimentation and\n   testing, as it allows rapid and easy deployment\
    \ of ICN over existing\n   IP networks.\n"
- title: 4.3.  ICN-as-an-Underlay
  contents:
  - "4.3.  ICN-as-an-Underlay\n   Proposals, such as [POINT] and [White], outline\
    \ the deployment option\n   of using an ICN underlay that would integrate with\
    \ existing\n   (external) IP-based networks by deploying application-layer gateways\n\
    \   at appropriate locations.  The main reasons for such a configuration\n   option\
    \ is the introduction of ICN technology in given islands (e.g.,\n   inside a CDN\
    \ or edge IoT network) to reap the benefits of native ICN,\n   in terms of underlying\
    \ multicast delivery, mobility support, fast\n   indirection due to location independence,\
    \ in-network computing, and\n   possibly more.  The underlay approach thus results\
    \ in islands of\n   native ICN deployments that are connected to the rest of the\
    \ Internet\n   through protocol conversion gateways or proxies.  Routing domains\
    \ are\n   strictly separated.  Outside of the ICN island, normal IP routing\n\
    \   protocols apply.  Within the ICN island, ICN-based routing schemes\n   apply.\
    \  The gateways transfer the semantic content of the messages\n   (i.e., IP packet\
    \ payload) between the two routing domains.\n"
- title: 4.3.1.  Edge Network
  contents:
  - "4.3.1.  Edge Network\n   Native ICN networks may be located at the edge of the\
    \ network where\n   the introduction of new network architectures and protocols\
    \ is easier\n   in so-called greenfield deployments.  In this context, ICN is\
    \ an\n   attractive option for scenarios, such as IoT [ICN-IoT].  The\n   integration\
    \ with the current IP protocol suite takes place at an\n   application gateway/proxy\
    \ at the edge network boundary, e.g.,\n   translating incoming CoAP request/response\
    \ transactions [RFC7252]\n   into ICN message exchanges or vice versa.\n   The\
    \ work in [VSER] positions ICN as an edge service gateway driven by\n   a generalized\
    \ ICN-based service orchestration system with its own\n   compute and network\
    \ virtualization controllers to manage an ICN\n   infrastructure.  The platform\
    \ also offers service discovery\n   capabilities to enable user applications to\
    \ discover appropriate ICN\n   service gateways.  To exemplify a scenario in a\
    \ use case, the [VSER]\n   platform shows the realization of a multi-party audio/video\n\
    \   conferencing service over such an edge cloud deployment of ICN\n   routers\
    \ realized over commodity hardware platforms.  This platform\n   has also been\
    \ extended to offer seamless mobility as a service that\n   [VSER-Mob] features.\n"
- title: 4.3.2.  Core Network
  contents:
  - "4.3.2.  Core Network\n   In this suboption, a core network would utilize edge-based\
    \ protocol\n   mapping onto the native ICN underlay.  For instance, [POINT] proposes\n\
    \   to map HTTP transactions or some other IP-based transactions, such as\n  \
    \ CoAP, directly onto an ICN-based message exchange.  This mapping is\n   realized\
    \ at the NAP, for example, in access points or customer\n   premise equipment,\
    \ which, in turn, provides a standard IP interface\n   to existing user devices.\
    \  Thus, the NAP provides the apparent\n   perception of an IP-based core network\
    \ toward any external peering\n   network.\n   The work in [White] proposes a\
    \ similar deployment configuration.\n   There, the goal is to use ICN for content\
    \ distribution within CDN\n   server farms.  Specifically, the protocol mapping\
    \ is realized at the\n   ingress of the server farm where the HTTP-based retrieval\
    \ request is\n   served, while the response is delivered through a suitable egress\n\
    \   node translation.\n"
- title: 4.4.  ICN-as-a-Slice
  contents:
  - "4.4.  ICN-as-a-Slice\n   The objective of network slicing [NGMN-5G] is to multiplex\
    \ a general\n   pool of compute, storage, and bandwidth resources among multiple\n\
    \   service networks with exclusive SLA requirements on transport and\n   compute-level\
    \ QoS and security.  This is enabled through NFV and SDN\n   technology functions\
    \ that enable functional decomposition (hence,\n   modularity, independent scalability\
    \ of control, and/or the user-plane\n   functions), agility, and service-driven\
    \ programmability.  Network\n   slicing is often associated with 5G but is clearly\
    \ not limited to\n   such systems.  However, from a 5G perspective, the definition\
    \ of\n   slicing includes access networks enabling dynamic slicing of the\n  \
    \ spectrum resources among various services, hence naturally extending\n   itself\
    \ to end points and cloud resources across multiple domains, to\n   offer end-to-end\
    \ guarantees.  Once instantiated, these slices could\n   include a mix of connectivity\
    \ services (e.g., LTE-as-a-service),\n   Over-the-Top (OTT) services (e.g., VoD),\
    \ or other IoT services\n   through composition of a group of virtual and/or physical\
    \ network\n   functions at the control-, user-, and service-plane levels.  Such\
    \ a\n   framework can also be used to realize ICN slices with its own control\n\
    \   and forwarding plane, over which one or more end-user services can be\n  \
    \ delivered [NGMN-Network-Slicing].\n   The 5G next generation architecture [fiveG-23501]\
    \ provides the\n   flexibility to deploy the ICN-as-a-Slice over either the edge\
    \ (RAN)\n   or mobile core network; otherwise, the ICN-as-a-Slice may be deployed\n\
    \   end to end.  Further discussions on extending the architecture\n   presented\
    \ in [fiveG-23501] and the corresponding procedures in\n   [fiveG-23502] to support\
    \ ICN has been provided in [ICN-5GC].  The\n   document elaborates on two possible\
    \ approaches to enable ICN: (1) as\n   an edge service using the local data network\
    \ (LDN) feature in 5G\n   using User Plane Function (UPF) classification functions\
    \ to fast\n   handover to the ICN forwarder and (2) as a native deployment using\n\
    \   the non-IP Protocol Data Unit (PDU) support that would allow new\n   network\
    \ layer PDU to be handed over to ICN UPFs collocated with the\n   Generation NodeB\
    \ (gNB) functions without invoking any IP functions.\n   While the former deployment\
    \ would still rely on 3GPP-based mobility\n   functions, the later would allow\
    \ mobility to be handled natively by\n   ICN.  However, both these deployment\
    \ modes should benefit from other\n   ICN features, such as in-network caching\
    \ and computing.  Associated\n   with this ICN user-plane enablement, control-plane\
    \ extensions are\n   also proposed leveraging 5th Generation Core Network (5GC)'s\n\
    \   interface to other application functions (AFs) to allow new network\n   service-level\
    \ programmability.  Such a generalized network slicing\n   framework should be\
    \ able to offer service slices over both IP and\n   ICN.  Coupled with the view\
    \ of ICN functions as being \"service\n   function chaining\" [RFC7665], an ICN\
    \ deployment within such a slice\n   could also be realized within the emerging\
    \ control plane that is\n   targeted for adoption in future (e.g., 5G mobile)\
    \ network\n   deployments.  Finally, it should be noted that ICN is not creating\n\
    \   the network slice but instead that the slice is created to run a 5G-\n   ICN\
    \ instance [Ravindran].\n   At the level of the specific technologies involved,\
    \ such as ONAP\n   [ONAP] (which can be used to orchestrate slices), the 5G-ICN\
    \ slice\n   requires compatibility, for instance, at the level of the forwarding/\n\
    \   data plane depending on if it is realized as an overlay or using\n   programmable\
    \ data planes.  With SDN emerging for new network\n   deployments, some ICN approaches\
    \ will need to integrate as a data-\n   plane forwarding function with SDN, as\
    \ briefly discussed in\n   Section 4.1.  Further cross-domain ICN slices can also\
    \ be realized\n   using frameworks, such as [ONAP].\n"

  contents:
  - "5.1.  Application and Service Migration\n   The Internet supports a multitude\
    \ of applications and services using\n   the many protocols defined over the packet-level\
    \ IP service.  HTTP\n   provides one convergence point for these services with\
    \ many web\n   development frameworks based on the semantics provided by it. \
    \ In\n   recent years, even services such as video delivery have been\n   migrating\
    \ from the traditional RTP-over-UDP delivery to the various\n   HTTP-level streaming\
    \ solutions, such as DASH [DASH] and others.\n   Nonetheless, many non-HTTP services\
    \ exist, all of which need\n   consideration when migrating from the IP-based\
    \ Internet to an ICN-\n   based one.\n   The underlay deployment configuration\
    \ option presented in Section 4.3\n   aims at providing some level of compatibility\
    \ to the existing\n   ecosystem through a proxy-based message flow mapping mechanism\
    \ (e.g.,\n   mapping of existing HTTP/TCP/IP message flows to HTTP/ICN message\n\
    \   flows).  A related approach of mapping TCP/IP to TCP/ICN message\n   flows\
    \ is described in [Moiseenko].  Another approach described in\n   [Marchal] uses\
    \ HTTP/NDN gateways and focuses, in particular, on the\n   right strategy to map\
    \ HTTP to NDN to guarantee a high level of\n   compatibility with HTTP while enabling\
    \ an efficient caching of data\n   in the ICN island.  The choice of approach\
    \ is a design decision based\n   on how to configure the protocol stack.  For\
    \ example, the approach\n   described in [Moiseenko] carries the TCP layer into\
    \ the ICN underlay,\n   while the [Marchal] approach terminates both HTTP and\
    \ TCP at the edge\n   of the ICN underlay and maps these functionalities onto\
    \ existing ICN\n   functionalities.\n   Alternatively, ICN-as-an-Overlay (Section\
    \ 4.2) and ICN-as-a-Slice\n   (Section 4.4) allow for the introduction of the\
    \ full capabilities of\n   ICN through new application/service interfaces, as\
    \ well as operations\n   in the network.  With that, these approaches of deployment\
    \ are likely\n   to aim at introducing new application/services capitalizing on\
    \ those\n   ICN capabilities, such as in-network multicast and/or caching.\n \
    \  Finally, [ICN-LTE-4G] outlines a dual-stack end-user device approach\n   that\
    \ is applicable for all deployment configurations.  Specifically,\n   it introduces\
    \ middleware layers (called the TCL) in the device that\n   will dynamically adapt\
    \ existing applications to either an underlying\n   ICN protocol stack or standard\
    \ IP protocol stack.  This involves end\n   device signaling with the network\
    \ to determine which protocol stack\n   instance and associated middleware adaptation\
    \ layers to utilize for a\n   given application transaction.\n"

    \ 4.3.1, application gateways/proxies can\n   integrate such edge deployments\
    \ into IP-based services, e.g.,\n   utilizing CoAP-based [RFC7252] M2M platforms,\
    \ such as oneM2M [oneM2M]\n   or others.\n   Another area of increased edge network\
    \ innovation is that of mobile\n   (access) networks, particularly in the context\

    \ service\n   orchestration frameworks leveraging NFV and SDN concepts) are now\n\
    \   common in access networks and other network segments.  Therefore, the\n  \
    \ ICN-as-a-Slice deployment configuration in Section 4.4 provides a\n   suitable\
    \ migration path for the integration of non-IP-based edge\n   networks into the\
    \ overall system by virtue of realizing the relevant\n   (ICN) protocols in an\
    \ access network slice.\n   With the advent of SDN and NFV capabilities, so-called\
    \ campus or\n   site-specific deployments could see the introduction of ICN islands\n\

    \   Environments\".  The project aims to run NDN over virtualized NFV\n   infrastructure\
    \ [Doctor] (based on Docker technology) and focuses on\n   the NFV MANO aspects\
    \ to build an operational NDN network focusing on\n   important performance criteria,\
    \ such as security, performance, and\n   interoperability.\n   The data plane\
    \ relies on an HTTP/NDN gateway [Marchal] that processes\n   HTTP traffic and\
    \ transports it in an optimized way over NDN to\n   benefit from the properties\
    \ of the NDN island (i.e., by mapping HTTP\n   semantics to NDN semantics within\
    \ the NDN island).  The testbed\n   carries real Web traffic of users and has\
    \ been currently evaluated\n   with the top 1000 most popular websites.  The users\
    \ only need to set\n   the gateway as the web proxy.  The control plane relies\
    \ on a central\n   manager that uses machine-learning-based detection methods\
    \ [Mai-1]\n   from the date gathered by distributed probes and applies orchestrated\n\
    \   countermeasures against NDN attacks [Nguyen-1] [Nguyen-2] [Mai-2] or\n   performance\
    \ issues.  A remediation can be, for example, the scale up\n   of a bottleneck\
    \ component or the deployment of a security function,\n   like a firewall or a\
    \ signature verification module.  Test results\n   thus far have indicated that\
    \ key attacks can be detected accurately.\n   For example, content poisoning attacks\
    \ can be detected at up to over\n   95% accuracy (with less than 0.01% false positives)\

  - "6.3.  Composite-ICN Approach\n   Hybrid ICN [H-ICN_1] [H-ICN_2] is an approach\
    \ where the ICN names are\n   mapped to IPv6 addresses and other ICN information\
    \ is carried as\n   payload inside the IP packet.  This allows standard (ICN-unaware)\
    \ IP\n   routers to forward packets based on IPv6 info but enables ICN-aware\n\
    \   routers to apply ICN semantics.  The intent is to enable rapid hybrid\n  \
    \ deployments and seamless interconnection of IP and Hybrid ICN\n   domains. \
    \ Hybrid ICN uses [CICN] open-source software.  Initial tests\n   have been done\
    \ with 150 clients consuming DASH videos, which showed\n   good scalability properties\
    \ at the server side using the Hybrid ICN\n   transport [H-ICN_3] [H-ICN_2].\n"

  - "6.4.  Summary of Deployment Trials\n   In summary, there have been significant\
    \ trials over the years with\n   all the major ICN protocol flavors (e.g., CCNx,\
    \ NDN, and POINT) using\n   both the ICN-as-an-Overlay and ICN-as-an-Underlay\
    \ deployment\n   configurations.  The major limitations of the trials include\
    \ the fact\n   that only a limited number of applications have been tested.\n\
    \   However, the tested applications include both native ICN and existing\n  \
    \ IP-based applications (e.g., videoconferencing and IPTV).  Another\n   limitation\
    \ of the trials is that all of them involve less than 1k\n   users.\n   Huawei\
    \ and China Unicom have just started trials of the ICN-as-\n   a-Slice configuration\
    \ to demonstrate ICN features of security,\n   mobility, and bandwidth efficiency\
    \ over a wired infrastructure using\n   videoconferencing as the application scenario\
    \ [Chakraborti]; also,\n   this prototype has been extended to demonstrate this\
    \ over a 5G-NR\n   access.\n   The Clean-slate ICN approach has obviously never\
    \ been in trials, as\n   complete replacement of Internet infrastructure (e.g.,\
    \ existing\n   applications, TCP/IP protocol stack, IP routers, etc.) is no longer\n\
    \   considered a viable alternative.\n   Finally, Hybrid ICN is a Composite-ICN\
    \ approach that offers an\n   interesting alternative, as it allows ICN semantics\
    \ to be embedded in\n   standard IPv6 packets so the packets can be routed through\
    \ either IP\n   routers or Hybrid ICN routers.  Note that some other trials, such\
    \ as\n   the DOCTOR testbed (Section 6.2.6), could also be characterized as a\n\
    \   Composite-ICN approach, because it contains both ICN gateways (as in\n   ICN-as-an-Underlay)\
    \ and virtualized infrastructure (as in ICN-as-\n   a-Slice).  However, for the\
    \ DOCTOR testbed, we have chosen to\n   characterize it as an ICN-as-an-Underlay\
    \ configuration because that\n   is a dominant characteristic.\n"

  - "7.2.  Protocols for Content Delivery Network Migration\n   A key issue in CDNs\
    \ is to quickly find a location of a copy of the\n   object requested by an end\
    \ user.  In ICN, a Named Data Object (NDO)\n   is typically defined by its name.\
    \  [RFC6920] defines a mechanism that\n   is suitable for static naming of ICN\
    \ data objects.  Other ways of\n   encoding and representing ICN names have been\
    \ described in [RFC8609]\n   and [RFC8569].  Naming dynamically generated data\
    \ requires different\n   approaches(e.g., hash-digest-based names would normally\
    \ not work),\n   and there is a lack of established conventions and standards.\n\
    \   Another CDN issue for ICN is related to multicast distribution of\n   content.\
    \  Existing CDNs have started using multicast mechanisms for\n   certain cases,\
    \ such as for broadcasting streaming TV.  However, as\n   discussed in Section\
    \ 6.2.1, certain ICN approaches provide\n   substantial improvements over IP multicast,\
    \ such as the implicit\n   support for multicast retrieval of content in all ICN\
    \ flavors.\n   Caching is an implicit feature in many ICN architectures that can\n\
    \   improve performance and availability in several scenarios.  The ICN\n   in-network\
    \ caching can augment managed CDN and improve its\n   performance.  The details\
    \ of the interplay between ICN caching and\n   managed CDN need further consideration.\n"

  - "7.3.  Protocols for Edge and Core Network Migration\n   ICN provides the potential\

    \ results available\n   independent of location can enable a lightweight insertion\
    \ of traffic\n   into the network without relying on redirection of DNS requests.\
    \  For\n   this, proxies that translate from commonly used protocols in the\n\
    \   general Internet to ICN message exchanges in the ICN domain could be\n   used\
    \ for the migration of application and services within deployments\n   at the\
    \ network edge but also in core networks.  This is similar to\n   existing approaches\
    \ for IoT scenarios where a proxy translates CoAP\n   request/responses to other\
    \ message formats.  For example, [RFC8075]\n   specifies proxy mapping between\
    \ CoAP and HTTP protocols.  Also,\n   [RFC8613] is an example of how to pass end-to-end\
    \ encrypted content\n   between HTTP and CoAP by an application-layer security\

- title: 8.  Conclusion
  contents:
  - "8.  Conclusion\n   This document provides high-level deployment considerations\
    \ for\n   current and future members of the ICN community.  Specifically, the\n\
    \   major configurations of possible ICN deployments are identified as\n   (1)\
    \ Clean-slate ICN replacement of existing Internet infrastructure,\n   (2) ICN-as-an-Overlay,\
    \ (3) ICN-as-an-Underlay, (4) ICN-as-a-Slice,\n   and (5) Composite-ICN.  Existing\
    \ ICN trial systems primarily fall\n   under the ICN-as-an-Overlay, ICN-as-an-Underlay,\
    \ and Composite-ICN\n   configurations.\n   In terms of deployment migration paths,\
    \ ICN-as-an-Underlay offers a\n   clear migration path for CDN, edge, or core\
    \ networks to go to an ICN\n   paradigm (e.g., for an IoT deployment) while leaving\
    \ the critical\n   mass of existing end-user applications untouched.  ICN-as-an-Overlay\n\
    \   is the easiest configuration to deploy rapidly, as it leaves the\n   underlying\
    \ IP infrastructure essentially untouched.  However, its\n   applicability for\
    \ general deployment must be considered on a case-by-\n   case basis.  (That is,\
    \ can it support all required user\n   applications?).  ICN-as-a-Slice is an attractive\
    \ deployment option\n   for upcoming 5G systems (i.e., for 5G radio and core networks)\
    \ that\n   will naturally support network slicing, but this still has to be\n\
    \   validated through more trial experiences.  Composite-ICN, by its\n   nature,\
    \ can combine some of the best characteristics of the other\n   configurations,\
    \ but its applicability for general deployment must\n   again be considered on\
    \ a case-by-case basis (i.e., can enough IP\n   routers be upgraded to support\
    \ Composite-ICN functionality to provide\n   sufficient performance benefits?).\n\
    \   There has been significant trial experience with all the major ICN\n   protocol\
    \ flavors (e.g., CCNx, NDN, and POINT).  However, only a\n   limited number of\
    \ applications have been tested so far, and the\n   maximum number of users in\
    \ any given trial has been less than 1k\n   users.  It is recommended that future\
    \ ICN deployments scale their\n   users gradually and closely monitor network\
    \ performance as they go\n   above 1k users.  A logical approach would be to increase\
    \ the number\n   of users in a slowly increasing linear manner and monitor network\n\
    \   performance and stability, especially at every multiple of 1k users.\n   Finally,\
    \ this document describes a set of technical features in ICN\n   that warrant\
    \ potential future IETF specification work.  This will aid\n   initial and incremental\
    \ deployments to proceed in an interoperable\n   manner.  The fundamental details\
    \ of the potential protocol\n   specification effort, however, are best left for\
    \ future study by the\n   appropriate IETF WGs and/or BoFs.  The ICNRG can aid\
    \ this process in\n   the near and mid-term by continuing to examine key system\
    \ issues like\n   QoS mechanisms, flexible naming schemes, and OAM support for\
    \ ICN.\n"

- title: 10.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "10.  Security Considerations\n   ICN was purposefully designed from the start\
    \ to have certain\n   intrinsic security properties.  The most well known of which\
    \ are\n   authentication of delivered content and (optional) encryption of the\n\
    \   content.  [RFC7945] has an extensive discussion of various aspects of\n  \
    \ ICN security, including many that are relevant to deployments.\n   Specifically,\
    \ [RFC7945] points out that ICN access control, privacy,\n   security of in-network\
    \ caches, and protection against various network\n   attacks (e.g., DoS) have\
    \ not yet been fully developed due to the lack\n   of a sufficient mass of deployments.\
    \  [RFC7945] also points out\n   relevant advances occurring in the ICN research\
    \ community that hold\n   promise to address each of the identified security gaps.\
    \  Lastly,\n   [RFC7945] points out that as secure communications in the existing\n\
    \   Internet (e.g., HTTPS) become the norm, major gaps in ICN security\n   will\
    \ inevitably slow down the adoption of ICN.\n   In addition to the security findings\
    \ of [RFC7945], this document has\n   highlighted that all anticipated ICN deployment\
    \ configurations will\n   involve coexistence with existing Internet infrastructure\
    \ and\n   applications.  Thus, even the basic authentication and encryption\n\
    \   properties of ICN content will need to account for interworking with\n   non-ICN\
    \ content to preserve end-to-end security.  For example, in the\n   edge network\
    \ underlay deployment configuration described in\n   Section 4.3.1, the gateway/proxy\
    \ that translates HTTP or CoAP\n   request/responses into ICN message exchanges\
    \ will need to support a\n   security model to preserve end-to-end security. \
    \ One alternative\n   would be to consider an approach similar to [RFC8613], which\
    \ is used\n   to pass end-to-end encrypted content between HTTP and CoAP by an\n\
    \   application-layer security mechanism.  Further investigation is\n   required\
    \ to see if this approach is suitable to preserve ICN message\n   security through\
    \ future protocol translation functions (e.g., ICN to\n   HTTP or CoAP to ICN)\
    \ of gateways/proxies.\n   Finally, the DOCTOR project discussed in Section 6.2.6\
    \ is an example\n   of an early deployment that is looking at specific attacks\
    \ against\n   ICN infrastructure, in this case, looking at Interest Flooding\n\
    \   Attacks [Nguyen-2] and Content Poisoning Attacks [Nguyen-1] [Mai-2]\n   [Nguyen-3]\
    \ and evaluating potential countermeasures based on MANO-\n   orchestrated actions\
    \ on the virtualized infrastructure [Mai-1].\n"
