  - "Introduction\n   A debate has begun about the future of America's communications\n\
    \   infrastructure.  At stake is the future of the web of information\n   links\
    \ organically evolving from computer and telephone systems.  By\n   the end of\
    \ the next decade, these links will connect nearly all homes\n   and businesses\
    \ in the U.S.  They will serve as the main channels for\n   commerce, learning,\
    \ education, and entertainment in our society.  The\n   new information infrastructure\
    \ will not be created in a single step:\n   neither by a massive infusion of public\
    \ funds, nor with the private\n   capital of a few tycoons, such as those who\
    \ built the railroads.\n   Rather the national, public broadband digital network\
    \ will emerge\n   from the \"convergence\" of the public telephone network, the\
    \ cable\n   television distribution system, and other networks such as the\n \
    \  Internet.\n   The United States Congress is now taking a critical step toward\
    \ what\n   I call the National Public Network, with its authorization of the\n\
    \   National Research and Education Network (NREN, pronounced \"en-ren\").\n \
    \  Not only will the NREN meet the computer and communication needs of\n   scientists,\
    \ researchers, and educators, but also, if properly\n   implemented, it could\
    \ demonstrate how a broadband network can be used\n   in the future.  As policy\
    \ makers debate the role of the public\n   telephone and other existing information\
    \ networks in the nation's\n   information infrastructure, the NREN can serve\
    \ as a working test-bed\n   for new technologies, applications, and governing\
    \ policies that will\n   ultimately shape the larger national network.  Congress\
    \ has indicated\n   its intention that the NREN\n      would provide American\
    \ researchers and educators with the computer\n      and information resources\
    \ they need, while demonstrating how\n      advanced computer, high speed networks,\
    \ and electronic databases\n      can improve the national information infrastructure\
    \ for use by all\n      Americans. (1)\n   As currently envisioned, the NREN\n\
    \      would connect more than one million people at more than one\n      thousand\
    \ colleges, universities, laboratories, and hospitals\n      throughout the country,\
    \ giving them access to computing power and\n      information -- resources unavailable\
    \ anywhere today -- and making\n      possible the rapid proliferation of a truly\
    \ nationwide, ubiquitous\n      network... (2)\n   The combined demand of these\
    \ users would develop innovative new\n   services and further stimulate demand\
    \ for existing network\n   applications.  Library information services, for example,\
    \ have\n   already grown dramatically on the NREN's predecessor, the Internet,\n\
    \   because the\n      enhanced connectivity permits scholars and researchers\
    \ to\n      communicate in new and different ways.... Clearly, to be\n      successful,\
    \ effective, and of use to the academic and research\n      communities, the NREN\
    \ must be designed to nurture and accommodate\n      both the current as will\
    \ as future yet unknown uses of valuable\n      information resources. (3)\n \
    \  So as the NREN implementation process progresses, it is vital that\n   the\
    \ opportunities to stimulate innovative new information\n   technologies be kept\
    \ in mind, along with the specific needs of the\n   mission agencies which will\
    \ come to depend on the network.\n   Far from evolving into the whole of the National\
    \ Public Network\n   itself, the NREN is best thought of as a prototype for the\
    \ NPN, which\n   will emerge over time from the phone system, cable television,\
    \ and\n   many computer networks.  But the NREN is a growth site which, unlike\n\
    \   privately controlled systems, can be consciously shaped to meet\n   public\
    \ needs.  For a wide variety of services, some of which might\n   not be commercially\
    \ viable at the outset, the NREN can\n      provide selective access that proves\
    \ feasibility and leads to the\n      creation of a commercial infrastructure\
    \ that can support universal\n      services.... If we fully focus on ...[current]\
    \ goals and work our\n      way through a multitude of technical and operational\
    \ issues in the\n      process, then the success of the NREN will fully support\
    \ its\n      extension to broader uses in the years to follow. (4)\n   In order\
    \ to function as an effective test-bed, one that promotes\n   broad access to\
    \ a range of innovative, developing services, the NREN\n   must be built so that\
    \ it is easy for developers to offer new kinds of\n   applications, and is accessible\
    \ to a diversity of users.  For\n   example, to encourage the development of creative,\
    \ advanced library\n   services, it must be easy for libraries to open their data\
    \ bases to\n   users all across the network.  And if these library services are\
    \ to\n   flourish through the NREN, then the services must be available to\n \
    \  researchers and students all over the country, through a variety of\n   channels.\
    \  Though the NREN itself is intended to meet the\n   supercomputing and networking\
    \ needs of the government-financed\n   research community, Congress has wisely\
    \ recognized that it can also\n   function as a channel for delivery of a wide\
    \ range of privately-\n   developed information services.  To\n      encourage\
    \ use of the Network by commercial information service\n      providers, where\
    \ technically feasible, the Network shall have\n      accounting mechanisms which\
    \ allow, where appropriate, users or\n      groups of users to be charged for\
    \ their usage of copyrighted\n      materials over the Network. (5)\n   Congress\
    \ can create an environment that stimulates information\n   entrepreneurship by\
    \ mandating that the NREN rely on open technical\n   standards whose specifications\
    \ are not controlled by any private\n   parties and which are freely available\
    \ for all to use.  Such non-\n   proprietary standards will ensure that different\
    \ parts of the network\n   built and operated by independent parties, will all\
    \ work together\n   properly.  By employing widely-used, non-proprietary standards\
    \ the\n   NREN will make it easy for new information providers to offer their\n\
    \   wares on the network.  The market will snowball: as more services are\n  \
    \ offered, more users will be attracted, who will increase overall\n   demand.\
    \  The NREN will also be a test-bed for development and\n   experimentation with\
    \ new networking standards that facilitate even\n   broader, more efficient interconnection\
    \ than now possible on the\n   Internet.  But throughout the stages of the NREN,\
    \ all concerned\n   should be sure that these functionalities are fostered.\n\
    \   The NREN design and construction process is complex and will have\n   significant\
    \ effects on future communications infrastructure design:\n      Building the\
    \ NREN has frequently been described as akin to\n      building a house, with\
    \ various layers of the network architecture\n      compared to parts of the house.\
    \  In an expanded view of this\n      analogy, planning the NII [national information\
    \ infrastructure] is\n      like designing a large, urban city.\n      The NREN\
    \ is a big new subdivision on the edge of the metropolis,\n      reserved for\
    \ researchers and educators.  It is going to be built\n      first and is going\
    \ to look lonely out there in the middle of the\n      pasture for a while.  But\
    \ the city will grow up around it in time,\n      and as construction proceeds,\
    \ the misadventures encountered in the\n      NREN subdivision will not have to\
    \ be repeated in others.  And\n      there will be many house designs, not just\
    \ those the NREN families\n      are comfortable with.... The lessons we learn\
    \ today in building\n      the NREN will be used tomorrow in building the NII.\
    \ (6)\n   The coming implementation and design of the NREN offers us a critical\n\
    \   opportunity to shape a small but important part of the National\n   Public\
    \ Network.\n"
- title: VISIONS
  contents:
  - "VISIONS\n   At its best, the National Public Network would be the source of\n\
    \   immense social benefits.  As a means of increasing social\n   cohesiveness,\
    \ while retaining the diversity that is an American\n   strength, the network\
    \ could help revitalize this country's business\n   and culture.  As Senator Gore\
    \ has said, the new national network that\n   is emerging is one of the \"smokestack\
    \ industries of the information\n   age.\" (7)  It will increase the amount of\
    \ individual participation in\n   common enterprise and politics.  It could also\
    \ galvanize a new set of\n   relationships -- business and personal -- between\
    \ Americans and the\n   rest of the world.\n   The names and particular visions\
    \ of the emerging information\n   infrastructure vary from one observer to another.\
    \ (8)  Senator Gore\n   calls it the \"National Information Superhighway.\"  Prof.\
    \ Michael\n   Dertouzos imagines a \"National Information Infrastructure [which]\
    \ ...\n   would be a common resource of computer-communications services, as\n\
    \   easy to use and as important as the telephone network, the electric\n   power\
    \ grid, and the interstate highways.\" (9)  I call it the National\n   Public\
    \ Network (NPN), in recognition of the vital role information\n   technology has\
    \ come to play in public life and all that it has to\n   offer, if designed with\
    \ the public good in mind.\n   To what uses can we reasonably expect people to\
    \ use a National Public\n   Network?  We don't know.  Indeed, we probably can't\
    \ know -- the users\n   of the network will surprise us.  That's exactly what\
    \ happened in the\n   early days of the personal computer industry, when the first\n\
    \   spreadsheet program, VisiCalc, spurred sales of the Apple II\n   computer.\
    \  Apple founders Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak did not design\n   the spreadsheet;\
    \ they did not even conceive of it.  They created a\n   platform which allowed\
    \ someone else to bring the spreadsheet into\n   being, and all the parties profited\
    \ as a result, including the users.\n   Based on today's systems, however, we\
    \ can make a few educated guesses\n   about the National Public Network.  We know\
    \ that, like the telephone,\n   it will serve both business and recreation needs,\
    \ as well as offering\n   crucial community services.  Messaging will be popular:\
    \ time and time\n   again, from the ARPAnet to Prodigy, people have surprised\
    \ network\n   planners with their eagerness to exchange mail.  \"Mail\" will not\
    \ just\n   mean voice and text, but also pictures and video -- no doubt with\n\
    \   many new variations.  One might imagine two people poring over a\n   manuscript\
    \ from opposite ends of the country, marking it up\n   simultaneously and seeing\
    \ each others' markings appear on the screen.\n   We know from past demand on\
    \ the Internet and commercial personal\n   computer networks that the network\
    \ will be used for electronic\n   assembly -- virtual town halls, village greens,\
    \ and coffee houses,\n   again taking place not just through shared text (as in\
    \ today's\n   computer networks), but with multi-media transmissions, including\n\
    \   images, voice, and video.  Unlike the telephone, this network will\n   also\
    \ be a publications medium, distributing electronic newsletters,\n   video clips,\
    \ and interpreted reports. (10)\n   We can speculate but cannot be sure about\
    \ novel uses of the network.\n   An information marketplace will include electronic\
    \ invoicing,\n   billing, listing, brokering, advertising, comparison-shopping,\
    \ and\n   matchmaking of various kinds.  \"Video on demand\" will not just mean\n\
    \   ordering current movies, as if they were spooling down from the local\n  \
    \ videotape store, but opening floodgates to vast new amounts of\n   independent\
    \ work, with high quality thanks to plummeting prices of\n   professional-quality\
    \ desktop video editors.  Customers will grow used\n   to dialing up two-minute\
    \ demos of homemade videos before ordering the\n   full program and storing it\
    \ on their own blank tape.\n   There will be other important uses of the network\
    \ as a simulation\n   medium for experiences which are impossible to obtain in\
    \ the mundane\n   world.  If scientists want to explore the surface of a molecule,\n\
    \   they'll do it in simulated form, using wrap-around three-dimensional\n   animated\
    \ graphics that create a convincing illusion of being in a\n   physical place.\
    \  This visualization of objects from molecules to\n   galaxies is already becoming\
    \ an extraordinarily powerful scientific\n   tool.  Networks will amplify this\
    \ power to the point that these\n   simulation tools take their place as fundamental\
    \ scientific apparatus\n   alongside microscopes and telescopes.  Less exotically,\
    \ a consumer or\n   student might walk around the inside of a working internal\
    \ combustion\n   engine -- without getting burned.\n   Perhaps the most significant\
    \ change the National Public Network will\n   afford us is a new mode of building\
    \ communities -- as the telephone,\n   radio, and television did.  People often\
    \ think of electronic\n   \"communities\" as far-flung communities of interest\
    \ between followers\n   of a particular discipline.  But we are learning, through\
    \ examples\n   like the PEN system in Santa Monica and the Old Colorado City system\n\
    \   in Colorado Springs, that digital media can serve as a local nexus,\n   an\
    \ evanescent meeting-ground, that adds levels of texture to\n   relationships\
    \ between people in a particular locale.  As Jerry Berman\n   of the ACLU Information\
    \ Technology Project has said:\n      Computer and communications technologies\
    \ are transforming speech\n      into electronic formats and shifting the locus\
    \ of the marketplace\n      of ideas from traditional public places to the new\
    \ electronic\n      public forums established over telephone, cable, and related\n\
    \      electronic communications networks. (11)\n   To both local and long-distance\
    \ communities, accessible digital\n   communications will be increasingly important;\
    \ by the end of this\n   decade, the \"body politic,\" the \"body social,\" and\
    \ the \"body\n   commercial\" of this country will depend on a nervous system\
    \ of\n   fiber-optic lines and computer switches.\n   But whatever details of\
    \ the vision and names gives to the final\n   product, a network that is responsive\
    \ to a wide spectrum of human\n   needs will not evolve by default.  Just as it\
    \ is necessary for an\n   architect to know how to make a home suitable for human\
    \ habitation,\n   it is necessary to consider how humans will actually use the\
    \ network\n   in order to design it.\n   In that spirit, I offer a set of recommendations\
    \ for the evolution of\n   the National Public Network.  I first encountered many\
    \ of the\n   fundamental ideas underlying these proposals in the computer\n  \
    \ networking community.  Some of these recommendations address\n   immediate concerns;\
    \ others are more long-term.  There is a focus on\n   the role of public access\
    \ and commercial experiments in the NREN,\n   which complement its research and\
    \ education mission.  The\n   recommendations are organized here according to\
    \ the main needs which\n   they will serve: first ensuring that the design and\
    \ use of the\n   network remains open to diversity, second, safeguarding the freedom\n\
    \   of users.  The ultimate goal is to develop a habitable, usable and\n   sustainable\
    \ system -- a nation of electronic neighborhoods that\n   people will feel comfortable\
    \ living within.\n"
- title: I.  Encourage Competition Among Carriers
  contents:
  - "I.  Encourage Competition Among Carriers\n   In the context of the NREN, act\
    \ now to create a level and competitive\n   playing field for private network\
    \ carriers, (whether for-profit or\n   not-for-profit) to compete.  Do not give\
    \ a monopoly to any carrier.\n   The growing network must be a site where competitive\
    \ energy produces\n   innovation for the public benefit, not the refuge of monopolists.\n\
    \   The post-divestiture phone system offers us a valuable lesson: a\n   telecommunications\
    \ network can be managed effectively by separate\n   companies -- even including\
    \ bitter opponents like AT&T and MCI -- as\n   long as they can connect equitably\
    \ and seamlessly from the user's\n   standpoint.  The deregulated telecommunications\
    \ system may not work\n   perfectly and may produce too much litigation, but it\
    \ does work.  We\n   should never go back to any monopoly arrangement like the\
    \ pre-\n   divestiture AT&T which held back market-driven innovation in\n   telecommunications\
    \ for half a century.  Given the interconnection\n   technology now available,\
    \ we should never again have to accept the\n   argument that we have to sacrifice\
    \ interoperability for efficiency,\n   reliability, or easy-of-use.\n   Similarly,\
    \ the NREN, and later the National Public Network, must be\n   allowed to grow\
    \ without being dominated by any single company.\n   Contracting requirements\
    \ in the current legislation advance this\n   goal.\n      The Network shall be\
    \ established in a manner which fosters and\n      maintains competition within\
    \ the telecommunications industry and\n      promotes the development of interconnected\
    \ high-speed data\n      networks by the private sector. (12)\n   Absent a truly\
    \ competitive environment, a dominant carrier might use\n   its privileged access\
    \ to stifle competitors unfairly: \"Use our local\n   service to connect to our\
    \ undersea international links, without the\n   $3 surcharge we tack on for other\
    \ carriers.\" The greatest danger is\n   \"balkanization\" -- in which the net\
    \ is broken up into islands, each\n   developing separately, without enough interconnecting\
    \ bridges to\n   satisfy users' desires for universal connectivity.  Strong\n\
    \   interoperability requirements and adherence to standards must be\n   built\
    \ into the design of the NREN from the outset. (13)\n   After 1992, private companies\
    \ will manage an ever-greater share of\n   the NREN cables and switches.  The\
    \ NSF should use both carrot and\n   stick to encourage as much interconnection\
    \ as possible.  For example,\n   the NSF could make funding to NREN backbone carriers\
    \ contingent on\n   participation in an internetwork exchange agreement that would\
    \ serve\n   as a framework for a standards-based environment.  As the NREN is\n\
    \   implemented, some formal affirmation of fair access is needed --\n   ideally\
    \ by an \"Internet Exchange Association\" formed to settle common\n   rules and\
    \ standards.  (Their efforts, if strong enough, could\n   forestall a costly,\
    \ wasteful crazy-quilt of new regulations from the\n   FCC and 50 State Public\
    \ Utilities Commissions.) This association\n   should decide upon a \"basket\"\
    \ of standard services -- including\n   messaging, directories, international\
    \ connections, access to\n   information providers, billing, and probably more\
    \ -- that are\n   guaranteed for universal interconnection.  The Commercial Internet\n\
    \   Exchange (CIX) formed in 1991 by three commercial inter-networking\n   carriers\
    \ represents a substantive, initial move in this direction.\n"
- title: II.  Create an Open Platform for Innovation
  contents:
  - "II.  Create an Open Platform for Innovation\n   Encourage information entrepreneurship\
    \ through an open architecture\n   (non-proprietary) platform, with low barriers\
    \ to entry for\n   information providers.\n   The most valuable contribution of\
    \ the computer industry in the past\n   generation is not a machine, but an idea\
    \ -- the principle of open\n   architecture.  Typically, a hardware company (an\
    \ Apple or IBM, for\n   instance) neither designs its own applications software\
    \ nor requires\n   licenses of its application vendors.  Both practices were the\
    \ norm in\n   the mainframe era of computing.  Instead, in the personal computer\n\
    \   market, the hardware company creates a \"platform\" -- a common set of\n \
    \  specifications, published openly so that other, often smaller,\n   independent\
    \ firms can develop their own products (like the\n   spreadsheet program) to work\
    \ with it.  In this way, the host company\n   takes advantage of the smaller companies'\
    \ ingenuity and creativity.\n   Even interfaces rigidly controlled by a single\
    \ manufacturer, like the\n   Macintosh, embrace the platform concept.  Two years\
    \ ago, when Apple\n   began planning the System 7 release of its Macintosh operating\n\
    \   system, one of its first steps was to invite comment from software\n   companies\
    \ like Macromind, Aldus, Silicon Beach, and T/Maker.  In\n   substantive, sometimes\
    \ very argumentative sessions, Apple revealed\n   the capabilities it planned\
    \ to these independents, who knew their\n   customers and needs much better than\
    \ Apple.  One multi-media company,\n   after arguing that Apple should take a\
    \ different technical turn,\n   actually found itself doing the work in a joint\
    \ project.  The most\n   useful job of Apple's famous \"evangelists\" is not selling\
    \ the Mac\n   specs, but listening to outsiders, and helping Apple itself stay\n\
    \   flexible enough to work with independent innovators effectively.\n   In the\
    \ design of the NREN, information entrepreneurship can best be\n   promoted by\
    \ building with open standards, and by making the network\n   attractive to as\
    \ many service providers and developers as possible.\n   The standards adopted\
    \ must meet the needs of a broad range of users,\n   not just narrow needs of\
    \ the mission agencies that are responsible\n   for overseeing the early stages\
    \ of the NREN.  Positive efforts should\n   be made to encourage the development\
    \ of experimental commercial\n   services of all kinds without requiring the negotiation\
    \ of any\n   bureaucratic procedures.\n   In the early stages of development of\
    \ an industry, low barriers to\n   entry stimulate competition.  They enable a\
    \ very large initial set of\n   products for consumers to choose from.  Out of\
    \ these the market will\n   learn to ignore almost all in order to standardize\
    \ on a few, such as\n   a Lotus 1-2-3.  The winners will be widely emulated in\
    \ the next\n   generation of products, which will in turn generate a more refined\n\
    \   form of marketplace feedback.  In this fashion, early chaos evolves\n   quickly\
    \ a set of high-demand products and product categories.\n   This process of market-mediated\
    \ innovation is best catalyzed by\n   creating an environment in which it is inexpensive\
    \ and easy for\n   entrepreneurs to develop products.  The greater the number\
    \ of\n   independent enterprises, each of which puts at voluntary risk the\n \
    \  intellectual and economic capital of risk-takers, is the best way to\n   find\
    \ out what the market really wants.  The businesses which succeed\n   in this\
    \ are the ones which will prosper.\n   It is worthwhile to note that not a single\
    \ major PC software company\n   today dates from the mainframe era.  Yesterday's\
    \ garage shop is\n   today's billion-dollar enterprise.  Policies for the NPN\
    \ should\n   therefore not only accommodate existing information industry\n  \
    \ interests, but anticipate and promote the next generate of\n   entrepreneurs.\n\
    \   The diverse needs of these many users will create demand for\n   thousands\
    \ of information proprietors on the net, just as there are\n   thousands of producers\
    \ of personal computer software today and\n   thousands of publishers of books\
    \ and magazines.  It should be as easy\n   to provide an information service as\
    \ to order a business telephone.\n   Large and small information providers will\
    \ probably coexist as they\n   do in book publishing, where the players range\
    \ from multi-billion-\n   dollar international conglomerates to firms whose head\
    \ office is a\n   kitchen table.  They can coexist because everyone has access\
    \ to\n   production and distribution facilities -- printing presses,\n   typography,\
    \ and the U.S.  mails and delivery services -- on a non-\n   discriminatory basis.\
    \  In fact, the sub-commercial print publications\n   are an ecological breeding\
    \ ground, through which mainstream authors\n   and editors rise.  No one can guarantee\
    \ when an application as useful\n   as the spreadsheet will emerge for the NPN\
    \ (as it did for personal\n   computers), but open architecture is the best way\
    \ for it to happen\n   and let it spread when it does.\n   The PC revolution was\
    \ brought about without direct public support.\n   Entrepreneurs risked their\
    \ investors' capital for the sake of\n   opportunity.  Some succeeded, but many\
    \ others lost their entire\n   investment.  This is the way of the marketplace.\
    \  We should take a\n   much more cautious attitude about the commitment of public\
    \ monies.\n   In the absence of proven demand for new applications, government\n\
    \   should not be spending billions of dollars on the creation of\n   broadband\
    \ networks.  Neither should telephone companies be allowed to\n   pass on the\
    \ costs of the NPN in a way which would raise the rates for\n   ordinary voice\
    \ telephone service.\n   Instead, we should position the NREN to show there is\
    \ a market for\n   network applications.  The commercial experiments just beginning\
    \ on\n   the Internet provides one source of innovation.  Deployment of a\n  \
    \ national ISDN platform in the next few years represents another\n   relatively\
    \ inexpensive seed bed.  As such experiments demonstrate\n   more of a proven\
    \ demand for public network services, it should be\n   possible for the private\
    \ sector to make the investments to build the\n   broadband NPN using experience\
    \ from the NREN.\n   At the same time as the NREN is being debated and developed,\n\
    \   telephone companies continue to push at the limits imposed on them by\n  \
    \ the \"Modification of Final Judgment\" (MFJ) of divestiture, the 1982\n   anti-trust\
    \ agreement which split up the Bell system. (14)  Under\n   pressure from the\
    \ D.C. Court of Appeals, Judge Greene recently lifted\n   the information services\
    \ restrictions on the BOCs -- despite the\n   competitive tension between the\
    \ telephone companies, cable TV\n   carriers, and newspapers.  Thus, in the next\
    \ year or so, Congress may\n   well be forced to define a new set of rules for\
    \ regulated\n   telecommunications. (15)  Like the AT&T divestiture decision,\
    \ this\n   would represent a fundamental shift in national policy with enormous\n\
    \   and unpredictable consequences.\n   Many consumer and industry groups are\
    \ concerned that as the MFJ\n   restrictions are lifted, the RBOCs will come to\
    \ dominate the design\n   of the emerging National Public Network, shaping it\
    \ more to\n   accommodate their business goals than the public interest.  The\n\
    \   Communications Policy Forum, a coalition of public interest and\n   industry\
    \ groups, has recently begun to consider what kinds of\n   safeguards will be\
    \ needed to maintain a competitive information\n   services market that allows\
    \ RBOC participation.  The role that the\n   RBOCs come to play in the nation's\
    \ telecommunications infrastructure\n   is, of course, an issue that must be carefully\
    \ considered on its own.\n   But in this context, the NREN represents a critical\
    \ opportunity to\n   create a model for what a public network has to offer, free\
    \ from\n   commercial pressures.\n   With all of the uncertainty that surrounds\
    \ the RBOCs entry into the\n   information services market, we should use the\
    \ NREN to learn how to\n   develop a network environment where competitive entry\
    \ is easy enough\n   that the RBOCs opportunity to engage in anti-competitive\
    \ behavior\n   would be minimized.  There is evidence that the RBOCs are resisting\n\
    \   attempts to transform the public telephone system into a truly open\n   public\
    \ network (16) notwithstanding the FCCs stated intention do\n   implement Open\
    \ Network Architecture. (17)  But since the NREN\n   standards and procedures\
    \ can be designed away from the dominance of\n   the RBOCs, a fully open network\
    \ design is within reach.  In this\n   sense the NREN can be a test-bed for \"\
    safeguards\" against market\n   abuse just as it is a test ground for new technical\
    \ standards and\n   innovative network applications.\n   An open platform network\
    \ model carrier from the NREN to the National\n   Public Network would actually\
    \ make some MFJ restrictions less\n   necessary.  Phone companies were originally\
    \ prohibited from being\n   information providers because their bottleneck control\
    \ over the local\n   exchange hubs gives them an unfair advantage.  But on a network\
    \ in\n   which the local switch is open to information providers -- because\n\
    \   the platform itself is so rich and well-designed -- creativity and\n   quality\
    \ triumph over monopoly power.  Instead of restricting\n   information providers,\
    \ the National Public Network developers should\n   encourage the entry of as\
    \ many new parties as possible. Just as\n   personal computer companies started\
    \ in garages and attics, so will\n   tomorrow's information entrepreneurs, if\
    \ we give them a chance.\n   Their prototypes today, small computer networks,\
    \ electronic\n   newsletters, and chat lines, are among the most vibrant and\n\
    \   imaginative \"publishers\" in the world.\n"

  - "III.  Encourage Pricing for Universal Access\n   Everyone agrees in the abstract\
    \ with universal service -- the idea\n   that any individual who wishes should\
    \ be able to connect to a\n   National Public Network. But that's only a platitude\
    \ unless\n   accompanied by an inclusive pricing plan.\n   The importance of extending\
    \ universal access to information and\n   communication resources has been widely\
    \ recognized:\n      In light of the possibilities for new service offerings by\
    \ the\n      21st century, as well as the growing importance of\n      telecommunications\
    \ and information services to US economic and\n      social development, limiting\
    \ our concept of universal service to\n      the narrow provision of basic voice\
    \ telephone service no longer\n      services the public interest.  Added to universal\
    \ basic telephone\n      service should be the broader concept of universal opportunity\
    \ to\n      access these new technologies and applications. (18)\n   The problem\
    \ of disparate access to information resources has been\n   recognized in other\
    \ telecommunications arenas as well.  Congressman\n   Edward Markey (D-Mass.),\
    \ Chairman of the Subcommittee of\n   Telecommunications and Finance of the House\
    \ Energy and Commerce\n   Committee warns that:\n      [i]nformation services\
    \ are beginning to proliferate.  The\n      challenge before us is how to make\
    \ them available swiftly to the\n      largest number of Americans at costs which\
    \ don't divide the\n      society into information haves and havenots and in a\
    \ manner which\n      does not compromise our adherence to the long-cherished\
    \ principles\n      of diversity, competition and common carriage. (19)\n   To\
    \ address this problem in the long-term, there is legislation now\n   pending\
    \ which would broaden the guarantee of universal phone service\n   to universal\
    \ access to advanced telecommunications services.  Senator\n   Burns has proposed\
    \ that the universal service guarantee statement in\n   the Communications Act\
    \ of 1934 should be amended to include access to\n      a nation-wide, advanced,\
    \ interactive, interoperable, broadband\n      communications system available\
    \ to all people, businesses,\n      services, organizations, and households...\"\
    \ (20)\n   In the near term, the NREN can serve as a laboratory for testing a\n\
    \   variety of pricing and access schemes in order to determine how best\n   to\
    \ bring basic network services to large numbers of users.  The NREN\n   platform\
    \ should facilitate the offering of fee-based services for\n   individuals.\n\
    \   Cable TV is one good model: joining a service requires an investment\n   of\
    \ $100 for a TV set, which 99% of households already own, about $50\n   for a\
    \ cable hookup, and perhaps $15 per month in basic service.\n   Anything beyond\
    \ that, like premium movie channels or pay-per-events\n   is available at extra\
    \ cost. Similarly, a carrier providing connection\n   to the mature National Public\
    \ Network might charge a one-time startup\n   fee and then a low fixed monthly\
    \ rate for access to basic services,\n   which would include a voice telephone\
    \ capability.\n   Because regulators are concerned about any telephone service\
    \ that\n   might cause the price of basic voice service to rise, they are\n  \
    \ unwilling to approve new services which don't immediately recover\n   their\
    \ own costs.  They are concerned that any deficit will be passed\n   on to consumers\
    \ in the form of higher charges for standard services.\n   As a result, telephone\
    \ companies tend to be very conservative in\n   estimating the demand for new\
    \ services.  Prices for new services turn\n   out to be much higher than what\
    \ would be required for universal\n   digital service.  This is a kind of catch-22,\
    \ in which lower prices\n   won't be set until demand goes up, but demand will\
    \ never go up if\n   prices aren't low enough.\n   Open architecture could help\
    \ phone companies offer lower rates for\n   digital services. If opportunities\
    \ and incentives exist for\n   information entrepreneurs, they will create the\
    \ services which will\n   stimulate demand, increase volume, and create more revenue-generating\n\
    \   traffic for the carriers.  In a competitive market, with higher\n   volumes,\
    \ lower prices follow.\n"

  - "IV.  Make the Network Simple to Use\n   The ideal means of accessing the NPN\
    \ will not be a personal computer\n   as we know it today, but a much simpler,\
    \ streamlined information\n   appliance - a hybrid of the telephone and the computer.\n\
    \   \"Transparency\" is the Holy Grail of software designers. When a\n   program\
    \ is perfectly transparent, people forget about the fact that\n   they are using\
    \ a computer. The mechanics of the program no longer\n   intrude on their thoughts.\
    \ The most successful computer programs are\n   nearly always transparent: a spreadsheet,\
    \ for instance, is as self-\n   evident as a ledger page. Once users grasp a few\
    \ concepts (like rows,\n   cells, and formula relationships), they can say to\
    \ themselves,\n   \"What's in cell A-6?\" without feeling that they are using\
    \ an alien\n   language.\n   Personal computer communications, by contrast, are\
    \ practically\n   opaque.  Users must be aware of baud rates, parity, duplex,\
    \ and file\n   transfer protocols -- all of which a reasonably well-designed network\n\
    \   could handle for them. It's as if, every time you wanted to drive to\n   the\
    \ store, you had to open up the hood and adjust the sparkplugs. On\n   most Internet\
    \ systems, it's even worse; newcomers find themselves\n   confronting what John\
    \ Perry Barlow calls a \"savage user interface.\"\n   Messages bounce, conferencing\
    \ commands are confusing, headers look\n   like gibberish, none of it is documented,\
    \ and nobody seems to care.\n   The excitement about being part of an extended\
    \ community quickly\n   vanishes. On a National Public Network, this invites failure.\
    \  People\n   without the time to invest in learning arcane commands would simply\n\
    \   not participate. The network would become needlessly exclusionary.\n   Part\
    \ of the NREN goal of \"expand[ing] the number of researchers,\n   educators,\
    \ and students with ... access to high performance computing\n   resources\" (21)\
    \ is to make all network applications easy-to-use.  As\n   the experience of the\
    \ personal computer industry has shown, the only\n   way to bring information\
    \ resources to large numbers of people is with\n   simple, easy-to-learn tools.\
    \  The NREN can be a place where various\n   approaches to user-friendly networks\
    \ are tested and evaluated.\n   Technically trained people are not troglodytes;\
    \ they approve of\n   human-oriented design, even as they manage to use the network\
    \ today\n   without it.  For years, leaders within the Internet community have\n\
    \   been taking steps to improve ease of use on the network.  But the\n   training\
    \ of the technical community as a whole has given them little\n   practice making\
    \ their digital artifacts appropriate for non-technical\n   consumption.  Nor\
    \ are they often rewarded for doing so.  To a phone\n   company engineer designing\
    \ a new high-speed telephone switch, or to a\n   computer scientist pushing the\
    \ limits of a data compression\n   algorithm, the notion of making electronic\
    \ mail as simple as fax\n   machine may make sense, but it also feels like someone\
    \ else's job.\n   Being technically minded themselves, they feel comfortable with\
    \ the\n   specialized software they use and seldom empathize with the neophyte.\n\
    \   The result is a proliferation of arcane, clumsy tools in both\n   hardware\
    \ and software, defended by the cognoscenti: \"I use the \"vi\"\n   editor all\
    \ the time -- why would anyone have trouble with it?\"\n   If we have the vision\
    \ and commitment to try this, the transformation\n   of the network frontier from\
    \ wilderness to civilization need not\n   display the brutality of 19th century\
    \ imperialism.  As commercial\n   opportunities to offer applications and services\
    \ develop,\n   entrepreneurs will discover that ease of use sells. The normal,\n\
    \   sometimes slow, play of competitive markets should cause industry to\n   commit\
    \ the resources to serve the market by making access more\n   transparent.  But\
    \ at the start transparency will need deliberate\n   encouragement -- if only\

    \ presentation and\n   exchange standards on the road towards an internationally-accepted\n\
    \   set of standards for the National Public Network.\n   Standards -- the internal\
    \ language of networks -- are arranged in a\n   series of layers. The lower levels\
    \ detail how the networks'\n   subterranean \"wiring\" and \"plumbing\" is managed.\
    \  Well-developed sets\n   of lower-level standards such as TCP/IP are in wide\
    \ use and continue\n   to be refined and extended, but these alone are not sufficient.\
    \  The\n   uppermost layers contain specifications such as how text appears on\n\
    \   the screen and the components of which documents are composed.  These\n  \
    \ are the kinds of concerns which are directly relevant to users who\n   wish\

    \ need additional standards\n   beyond what have been developed for message addresses\

    \  of high-performance computers in networks and for common user\n      interfaces\
    \ to systems. (22)\n   As the implementation of the NREN moves forward, we must\
    \ ensure that\n   standards development remains both a public and private priority.\n\
    \   Failure to make a commitment to an environment with robust standards\n   would\
    \ be \"the beginning of a Tower of Babel that we can ill afford.\"\n   (23)  Since\

  - "VI.  Promote First Amendment Free Expression by\n     Affirming the Principles\
    \ of Common Carriage\n   In a society which relies more and more on electronic\
    \ communications\n   media as its primary conduit for expression, full support\
    \ for First\n   Amendment values requires extension of the common carrier principle\n\
    \   to all of these new media.\n   Common carriers are companies which provide\
    \ conduit services for the\n   general public.  They include railroads, trucking\
    \ companies, and\n   airlines as well as telecommunications firms.  A communications\n\
    \   common carrier, such as a telephone company is required to provide\n   its\
    \ services on a non-discriminatory basis.  It has no liability for\n   the content\
    \ of any transmission. A telephone company does not concern\n   itself with the\
    \ content of a phone call.  Neither can it arbitrarily\n   deny service to anyone.\
    \ (25)  The common carrier's duties have\n   evolved over hundreds of years in\
    \ the common law and later statutory\n   provisions.  The rules governing their\
    \ conduct can be roughly\n   distilled in a few basic principles. (26)  Common\
    \ carriers have a\n   duty to:\n        o provide services in a non-discriminatory\
    \ manner at a fair\n          price\n        o interconnect with other carriers\n\
    \        o provide adequate services\n   The carriers of the NREN and the National\
    \ Public Network, whether\n   telephone companies, cable television companies,\
    \ or other firms\n   should be treated in a similar fashion. (27)\n   Unlike many\
    \ other countries, our communications infrastructure is\n   owned by private corporations\
    \ instead of by the government.  Given\n   Congress' plan to build the NREN with\
    \ services from privately-owned\n   carriers, a legislatively-imposed duty of\
    \ common carriage is\n   necessary to protect free expression effectively.  As\
    \ Professor Eli\n   Noam, a former New York State Public Utility Commissioner,\
    \ explains:\n      [C]ommon carriage is the practical analog to [the] First Amendment\n\
    \      for electronic speech over privately-owned networks, where the\n      First\
    \ Amendment does not necessarily govern directly. (28)\n   To foster free expression\
    \ and move the national communications\n   infrastructure toward a full common\
    \ carrier regime, all NREN carriers\n   should be subject to common carriage obligations.\
    \  Given that the\n   NREN is designed to promote the development of science,\
    \ ensuring free\n   expression is especially important.  As on academic said:\n\
    \      I share with many researchers strong belief that much of the power\n  \
    \    of science (whether practiced by scientists, engineers, or\n      clinical\
    \ researchers) derives from the steadfast commitment to\n      free and unfettered\
    \ communication of information and knowledge.\n      (29)\n   A telecommunications\
    \ providers under a common carrier obligation\n   would have to carry any legal\
    \ message regardless of its content\n   whether it is voice, data, images, or\
    \ sound.  For example, if full\n   common carrier protections were in place for\
    \ all of the conduit\n   services offered by the phone company, the terminations\
    \ of\n   \"controversial\" 900 services such as political fundraising would not\n\
    \   be allowed, just as the phone company is now prohibited by the\n   Communications\
    \ Act from discriminating in the provision of basic\n   telephone services. (30)\
    \ Neither BOCs not IXCs would be allowed to\n   terminate service because of anticipated\
    \ harm to their \"corporate\n   image.\"  Though providers of 900 information\
    \ services did have their\n   freedom of expression abridged by the BOC/IXC action,\
    \ First Amendment\n   protection was not available to them because there was no\
    \ state\n   action underlying the termination.\n   As important as common carriage\
    \ is to the NPN, it is equally\n   important that it be implemented in such a\
    \ way as to avoid sinking\n   the carriers of these new networks into the same\
    \ regulatory gridlock\n   that characterizes much of telecommunications regulation.\
    \ (31)  This\n   would have a crippling effect of the pace of innovation and is\
    \ to be\n   avoided.  The controlled environment of the NREN should be taken\n\
    \   advantage of to experiment with various open access, common carriage\n   rules\
    \ and enforcement mechanisms to seek regulatory alternatives\n   other than what\
    \ has evolved in the public telephone system\n   Along with promoting free expression,\
    \ common carriage rules are\n   important for ensuring a competitive market in\
    \ information services\n   on the National Public Network.  Our society supports\
    \ the publication\n   of many thousands of periodicals and fifty thousand of new\
    \ books a\n   year as well as countless brochures, mailings, and other printed\n\
    \   communications.  Historically, the expense of producing\n   professional-quality\
    \ video programming has been a barrier to the\n   creation of similar diversity\
    \ in video.  Now the same advances in\n   computing which created desktop publishing\
    \ are delivering \"desktop\n   video\" which will make it affordable for the smallest\
    \ business,\n   agency, or group to create video consumables.  The NPN must\n\
    \   incorporate a distribution system of individual choice for the video\n   explosion.\n\
    \   If the cable company wants to offer a package of program channels, it\n  \
    \ should be free to do so.  But so should anyone else.  There will\n   continue\
    \ to be major demand for mass market video entertainment, but\n   the vision of\
    \ the NPN should not be limited to this form of content.\n   Anyone who wishes\
    \ to offer services to the public should be\n   guaranteed access over the same\
    \ fiber optic cable under the principle\n   of common carriage.  From this access\
    \ will come the entrepreneurial\n   innovation, and this innovation will create\
    \ the new forms of media\n   that exploit the interactive, multimedia capabilities\
    \ of the NPN.\n"

    \ matter the law is unenforceable.  Imported scanners capable\n   of receiving\
    \ all 850 cellular channels are widely available through\n   the gray market.\n\
    \   Cellular telephone transmissions are carried on radio waves which\n   travel\
    \ through the open air.  The ECPA provision which makes it\n   illegal to eavesdrop\

    \ for the NPN are too crucial to be left to special interests.\n   If we act now\
    \ to be inclusive rather than exclusive in the design of\n   the NPN we can create\
    \ an open and free electronic community in\n   America.  To fail to do so, and\
    \ to lose this opportunity, would be\n   tragic.\n"

    \   8.  Details of the visions vary in their content and expression.\n   Senator\
    \ Gore's bill mandates that federal agencies will serve as\n   information providers,\
    \ side by side with commercial services, making\n   (for instance) government-created\
    \ information available to the public\n   over the network. Individuals will gain\
    \ \"access to supercomputers,\n   computer data bases, other research facilities,\
    \ and libraries.\" (Gore\n   imagines junior high school students dialing in to\
    \ the Library of\n   Congress to look up facts for a term paper.)  Apple CEO John\
    \ Sculley\n   has predicted that \"knowledge navigators\" will use personal computers\n\
    \   to travel through realms of virtual information via public digital\n   networks.\n\
    \   Such visions are powerful, but they sometimes seem too much like\n   sales\
    \ tools; too vague and overconfident to set direction for\n   research.  People\
    \ often infer from the Apple's \"knowledge navigator\"\n   videotape, for instance,\
    \ that human-equivalent computer speech\n   recognition is just around the corner;\
    \ but in truth, it still\n   requires fundamental research breakthroughs. Network\
    \ users will still\n   need keyboards or pointing devices for many years. Nor\
    \ will the\n   network be able (as some have suggested) to translate automatically\n\
    \   between languages. (It will allow translators to work more\n   effectively,\
    \ posting their work online.)\n   9.  M. Dertouzos, Building the Information Marketplace,\

    \  S.272, section 5(d). This section continues: \"(1) to the maximum\n   extent\
    \ possible, operating facilities need for the Network should be\n   procured on\
    \ a competitive basis from private industry; (2) Federal\n   agencies shall promote\
    \ research and development leading to deployment\n   of commercial data communications\
    \ and telecommunications standards;\n   and (3) the Network shall be phased into\
    \ commercial operation as\n   commercial networks can meet the needs of American\
    \ researchers and\n   educators.\"\n   13.  The distinction between strong support\
    \ for interoperability and\n   something less is illustrated in the NREN compromise\
    \ debate occurring\n   as this paper is being written.  The bill from the Senate\
    \ Commerce\n   Committee (S.272) calls for \"interoperability among computer\n\
    \   networks,\" section 701(a)(6)(A), while the compromise currently being\n \
    \  discussed with the Energy Committee adopts a more watered down goal\n   of\
    \ \"software availability, productivity, capability, portability.\"\n   section\
    \ 701(a)(3)(B).\n   14.  552 F.Supp 151 (D.D.C. 1982)(Greene, J.).  The MFJ restrictions\n\
    \   barred the BOCs from providing long distance services, from\n   manufacturing\
    \ telephone equipment, and from providing information\n   services.\n   15.  The\
    \ Senate, under the leadership of Sen. Hollings, has just\n   recently voted to\

    \ 15, 1991) [hereinafter, ACLU Report].\n   \"Non-discriminatory access to new\
    \ communications systems must be\n   guaranteed not simply because it is the economically\
    \ efficient thing\n   to do, but more importantly because it is the only way to\
    \ ensure that\n   freedom of expression is preserved in the Information Age.\"\
    \n   27.  Though common carriage principles have historically been applied\n \
    \  to telephone and telegraph systems, the preservation of First\n   Amendment\
    \ values of free expression and free press was not the\n   motivating factor.\
    \  Professor de Sola Pool notes that telephone and\n   telegraph systems inherited\
    \ their common carrier obligations not so\n   much out of First Amendment concerns,\
    \ but in order to promote\n   commerce.  The more appropriate model to look to\
    \ in extending First\n   Amendment values to new communications technologies is\
    \ the mails.  As\n   reflected in the post clause, empowering Congress to \"establish\
    \ post\n   offices and post roads,\" the Constitutional drafters felt that\n \
    \  creation of a robust postal system was vital in order to ensure free\n   expression\
    \ and healthy political debate.  As Sen. John Calhoun said\n   in 1817:\n    \
    \  Let us conquer space.  It is thus that . . . a citizen of the West\n      will\
    \ read the news of Boston still moist from the press.  The mail\n      and the\
    \ press are the nerves of the body politic.\n   Non-discriminatory access to the\
    \ mails has been secured by the\n   Supreme Court as a vital extension of First\
    \ Amendment expression.  In\n   a dissent which is now reflective of current law,\
    \ Justice Holmes\n   argued that\n      [t]he United States may give up the Post\
    \ Office when it sees fit,\n      but while it carries it on the use of the mails\
    \ is almost as much\n      a part of free speech as the right to use our tongues.\

    \      (Holmes, J., dissenting)(emphasis added).  This principle was\n      finally\
    \ affirmed in Hannegan v. Esquire, 327 US 146 (1945) (cited\n      in de Sola\

    \ about obscene or\n   indecent dial-a-message services, a number of BOCs and\
    \ interexchange\n   carriers (IXCs, ie. MCI, Sprint, etc.) have adopted policies\
    \ which\n   limit the kinds of information services for which they will provide\n\
    \   billing and collection services.  Recently, some carriers have gone\n   so\
    \ far as to refuse to carry the services at all, even if the service\n   handles\
    \ its own billing.  See ACLU Report.\n   31.  See J. Berman & W. Miller, Communications\
