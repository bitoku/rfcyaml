  - "Abstract\n   This specification defines some common media features for describing\n\
    \   image resolution, size, color, and image representation methods that\n   are\
    \ common to web browsing, printing, and facsimile applications.\n   These features\
    \ are registered for use within the framework of [REG].\n"
- title: 1. Introduction
  contents:
  - "1. Introduction\n   This work was originally motivated by the requirements from\
    \ web\n   browsers to send the browser's display characteristics to the web\n\
    \   server to allow the server to choose an appropriate representation.\n   This\
    \ specification defines some common media features [REG] by which\n   a recipient\
    \ may inform a sender as to the characteristics of its\n   message handling. \
    \ The sender may then provide the variant of the\n   message that is most suitable\
    \ for the recipient.\n   Different variants would typically be higher or lower\
    \ resolution\n   images (for example) as appropriate.  In the case of a sending\
    \ to a\n   printer, the result would be higher quality output.  In the case of\
    \ a\n   small screen device (cellphone, portable digital assistant), the\n   result\
    \ would be faster transmission.\n   Media features may be used in many different\
    \ protocol situations.\n   Those defined in this specification can indicate the\
    \ display or\n   printer dimensions, resolution, color capability.  The physical\n\
    \   dimensions of a display may be inferred from the display size and\n   display\
    \ resolution. In the case of paper output, the paper size may\n   be expressed\
    \ as a token from a list of standard paper sizes.  These\n   are presented formally\
    \ in the Notation section.\n"
- title: 2. Media Feature Registrations
  contents:
  - "2. Media Feature Registrations\n   This section defines several media features,\
    \ using the form specified\n   in [REG].\n"
- title: 2.1 Image Size
  contents:
  - "2.1 Image Size\n   - Media Feature tag name(s):\n     pix-x\n     pix-y\n   -\
    \ ASN.1 identifier associated with this feature tag:\n     1.3.6.1.8.1.1\n   \
    \  1.3.6.1.8.1.2\n   - Summary of the media features indicated by this feature\
    \ tag:\n     These features indicate the display size of the recipient for\n \
    \    display or print, measured in pixels; they indicate horizontal\n     (pix-x)\
    \ and vertical (pix-y) dimensions.\n   - Values appropriate for use with this\
    \ feature tag:\n     Signed Integer\n   - The feature tag is intended primarily\
    \ for use in the following\n     applications, protocols, services, or negotiation\
    \ mechanisms:\n     Display and print applications where different media choices\
    \ will\n     be made depending on the size of the recipient device. For\n    \
    \ example, a web application for use on a 240x480 display might use\n     different\
    \ HTML pages than one intended for use on a 1024x768\n     display.\n"
- title: 2.2 Resolution
  contents:
  - "2.2 Resolution\n   - Media Feature tag name:\n     dpi\n   - ASN.1 identifier\
    \ associated with this feature tag:\n     1.3.6.1.8.1.3\n   - Summary of the media\
    \ features indicated by this feature tag:\n     This feature indicates the resolution\
    \ that the recipient can\n     display or print without loss, measured in pixels\
    \ per inch.\n     Typically resolution capability is represented as dots-per-inch\n\
    \     rather than in SI units [SI]. Values for dpi may be expressed as a\n   \
    \  rational to accomodate resolution of SI-based devices; for example\n     dpi=19558/100\
    \ can be used to represent a resolution of 77 dots per\n     centimeter.\n   -\
    \ Values appropriate for use with this feature tag:\n     Rational\n   - The feature\
    \ tag is intended primarily for use in the following\n     applications, protocols,\
    \ services, or negotiation mechanisms:\n     Printing and fax applications typically\
    \ choose representations of\n     a transmitted document depending on the resolution\
    \ of the\n     recipient rather than pixel size.\n   - Examples of typical use:\n\
    \     Choosing a version of a printable document to send to a printer.\n   - Considerations\
    \ particular to use in individual applications,\n     protocols, services, or\
    \ negotiation mechanisms:\n     Software applications are typically unaware of\
    \ the resolution of\n     the display. Note that there exist devices with different\n\
    \     resolution in different directions, i.e., individual pixels are\n     not\
    \ square. However, this feature only encompasses the\n     uniform resolution.\n"

  contents:
  - "2.3 Registration of 'ua-media'\n   - Media Feature tag name(s):\n     ua-media\n\
    \   - ASN.1 identifier associated with this feature tag:\n     1.3.6.1.8.1.4\n\
    \     - Summary of the media features indicated by this feature tag:\n     This\
    \ feature indicates the recipients device media, indicated with\n     an simple\
    \ token.\n   - Values appropriate for use with this feature tag:\n     Token with\
    \ an equality relationship. Values include:\n     screen           A refreshable\

    \ primarily for use in the following\n     applications, protocols, services,\
    \ or negotiation mechanisms:\n     Most of the feature values are useful for printing\
    \ applications, or\n     to distinguish printing from display.\n   - Examples\
    \ of typical use:\n     This might typically be used for selecting between a rendition\
    \ that\n     is intended to be printed and one that is intended to be displayed.\n\
    \   - Considerations particular to use in individual applications,\n     protocols,\
    \ services, or negotiation mechanisms:\n     Other media values were not included\
    \ because their utility seemed\n     relative.\n   - Interoperability considerations:\n\
    \     Interoperability with the Internet Print Protocol means that some\n    \
    \ additional feature values may need to be registered.\n"

    \ of the media features indicated by this feature tag:\n     For stationery, it\
    \ is often useful to have information about the\n     size of display used.  While\
    \ it is more precise and predictable to\n     use absolute resolution and pixel\
    \ sizes, some applications find it\n     useful to provide paper size in addition\
    \ to this information. Note\n     that not all of the paper may have a printable\
    \ area.\n   - Values appropriate for use with this feature tag:\n     Token with\
