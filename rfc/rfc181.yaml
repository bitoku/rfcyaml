    \ FIELD, CALIFORNIA\n                       MODIFICATIONS TO RFC #177\nCATEGORY\
    \  D.6\n    This RFC is intended to modifiy the proposal for a device\nindependent\
    \ graphical display description discussed in RFC #177.  Thanks\nare due to Stan\
    \ Mantiply of Ames for his ideas.  The main changes are in\nthe defini- tion of\
    \ coordinate areas to avoid one problem encountered\nwith the old definition and\
    \ to provide more flexibility.  Terms used are\nthose defined in RFC #177.\n \
    \   The problem encountered in the previous proposal was that the areas\nof the\
    \ NGS (network standard graphics screen), which were supposed to be\nabsolute\
    \ boundaries, could be crossed when a list was executed within\nthat space.  Scaling\
    \ of lists was also awkwardly done with specific\ncommands in the network standard\
    \ graphic display list (NGDL).\n    Coordinates will still be defined with 16\
    \ bit unsigned normalized\nfractions.  This will leave the resolution of the picture\
    \ up to the de-\nvice which eventually receives the NGDL.  The values will not\
    \ now be\ntied to the NGS or an area of the screen, but will be fractional\ndisplace-\
    \ ments from the lower left corner of the screen, an area, or an\nimage space.\n\
    \    Areas will still be rectangular and will be allowed to overlap, but\nnot\
    \ contain another area completely.  The attributes of an area are: its\n16 bit\
    \ integer name, by which it may be manipulated, two (x,y) pairs\nwhich will define\
    \ its lower left and upper right corners with respect to\nthe NGS.  No list executed\
    \ in an area may cross its boundaries.  Within\nan area may be any number of image\
    \ spaces which are dynamically defined\nwith the execution of a list and define\
    \ its relationship to the contain-\ning area.\n    The list item types 7 and 8\
    \ shall be changed from EXECUTE LIST\n(Name,x,y) and COPY LIST (Name,x,y) to EXECUTE\
    \ LIST\n(Name,(Xl,Yl),(Xr,Yr)) and COPY LIST (Name,(Xl,Yl),(Xr,Yr))\nrespectively.\
    \  The coordinate pairs (Xl,Yl) and (Xr,Yr) define the image\narea of that list\
    \ as displacements from the lower left corner of the\ncontaining area.  If the\
    \ list executes other lists within it, their\nimage areas are defined as displacements\
    \ from the image area of the list\ncontaining the execute command.  Thus each\
    \ list can be scaled\ndifferently each time it is executed and may even be distorted\
    \ if the\nimage area defined has different ratios of X and Y lengths.  Lists\n\
    executed within other lists will have the same relationship to their\ncontaining\
    \ lists regardless of that lists's rela- tionship to the NGS\narea.  Since the\
    \ initial image area is defined rela- tive to the NGSD\narea, no overlaps can\
    \ occur.\ncution.\n    A change to the NGLI is implied.  Whenever an EXECUTE LIST\
    \ command\nis encountered, the current state is saved, a new current origin is\
    \ com-\nputed, NGLP is reset to zero, and new X and Y scale factors must be cal-\n\
    culated to transform the coordinates in the new list to actual screen\ncoor- dinates.\n\
    \    Another construct for graphics processing will be added.  This is\nthe mode\
    \ stack for each graphics mode.  It will be used for saving and\nrestoring character\
    \ and vector mode values as lists are recursively exe-\ncuted.  Four new list\
    \ items will be added to handle these operations.\n   PUSH CHARACTER MODE    (item\
    \ type = 14)\n   PUSH VECTOR MODE       (item type = 15)\n   POP CHARACTER MODE\
    \     (item type = 16)\n   POP VECTOR MODE        (item type = 17)\n    The DEFINE\
    \ LIST command (type = 1) shall have its parameters\nchanged.  It shall have two\
    \ parameters, a 16 bit integer name, by which\nit may be manipulated and referenced,\
    \ and a 16 bit integer defining the\nlength of the list in bytes rather than items.\
    \  This change is intended\nto make processing the NGDS easier and will eliminate\
    \ the TABLE item\n(type = 11).\n    The first three list items should have the\
    \ WORD IMAGE eliminated\nfrom them, since they are defining NGS areas now.\n \
    \   The list command DEFINE IMAGE ARE (type = 2) shall be changed to\nDEFINE AREA\
    \ for the same reasons.\n       [ This RFC was put into machine readable form\
    \ for entry ]\n         [ into the online RFC archives by Gert Doering 6/97 ]\n"
