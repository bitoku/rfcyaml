  - "1.  Introduction\n   This document describes a standard definition of MIME types\n
    \  associated with MP4 files and the guidelines for using them.\n   MPEG-4 (ISO/IEC
    14496) is a standard designed for the representation\n   and delivery of multimedia
    information over a variety of transport\n   protocols [1].  It includes interactive
    scene management and visual\n   and audio representations, as well as system functionality
    like\n   multiplexing, synchronization, and an object descriptor framework\n   [2].\n
    \  The historical approach for MPEG data has been to declare it under\n   \"video\",
    and this approach is followed for ISO/IEC 14496.  In\n   addition, some MIME types
    are defined under \"audio\" and \"application\"\n   for the streams not containing
    visual presentation.\n   Amendment 1 of the ISO/IEC 14496 standard (also known
    as version 2)\n   introduced a standard file type, called MP4 files, for encapsulating\n
    \  ISO/IEC 14496 data.  This is now separately specified as the MP4 file\n   format
    [4], which in turn is based on the ISO base media file format\n   [3].  A separate
    specification [5] covers the storage of Advanced\n   Video Coding (AVC) (also
    known as H.264) [6] material in files based\n   on the ISO base media file format.
    \ The MP4 file type can be used in\n   a number of ways; perhaps the most important
    of these is its use as\n   an interchange format for ISO/IEC 14496 data, as a
    content-download\n   format, and as the format read by streaming media servers.\n
    \  These first two uses will be greatly facilitated if there is a\n   standard
    MIME type for serving these files (e.g., over HTTP).\n   The ISO/IEC 14496 standard
    is broad, and therefore the type of data\n   that may be in such a file can vary.
    \ In brief, simple compressed\n   video and audio (using a number of different
    compression algorithms)\n   can be included; interactive scene information; meta-data
    about the\n   presentation; references to ISO/IEC 14496 media streams outside
    the\n   file and so on.  Different top-level MIME types are used to identify\n
    \  the type of the contents in the file.\n"
  title: 1.  Introduction

  - "2.  Selection of MIME Types for MP4 Files\n   The MIME types to be assigned to
    MP4 files are selected according to\n   the contents.  Basic guidelines for selecting
    MIME types are as\n   follows:\n   a) if the file contains neither visual nor
    audio presentations, but\n      only, for example, MPEG-J or MPEG-7, use application/mp4;\n
    \  b) for all other files, including those that have MPEG-J, etc., in\n      addition
    to video or audio streams, video/mp4 should be used;\n      however:\n   c) for
    files with audio but no visual aspect, including those that\n      have MPEG-J,
    etc., in addition to audio streams, audio/mp4 may be\n      used.\n   In any case,
    these indicate files conforming to the \"MP4\"\n   specification, ISO/IEC 14496-1:2000,
    systems file format.\n"

  title: 3.  IANA Considerations
- contents:
  - "4.  Security Considerations\n   It is possible to inject non-compliant MPEG streams
    (Audio, Video,\n   and Systems) in the MP4 file to overload the receiver/decoder's\n
    \  buffers.  This might compromise the functionality of the receiver or\n   even
    crash it.  This is especially true for end-to-end systems like\n   MPEG, where
    the buffer models are precisely defined.\n   An MP4 file supports the storage
    of stream types, including commands\n   that are executed on the terminal such
    as OD command and BIFS\n   commands, and programmatic content such as MPEG-J (Java(TM)
    Byte\n   Code) and ECMASCRIPT.  It is possible to use one or more of the above\n
    \  in a manner non-compliant to MPEG to crash the receiver or\n   temporarily
    make it unavailable.\n   Authentication mechanisms can be used to validate of
    the sender and\n   the data to prevent security problems due to non-compliant
    malignant\n   MP4 files.\n   A security model is defined in ISO/IEC 14496 Systems
    MP4 files\n   containing MPEG-J contents that comprises Java(TM) classes and\n
    \  objects.  MPEG-J defines a set of Java(TM) APIs and a secure\n   execution
    model.  MPEG-J content can call this set of APIs and\n   Java(TM) methods from
    a set of Java packages supported in the\n   receiver within the defined security
    model.  According to this\n   security model, downloaded byte code is forbidden
    to load libraries,\n   to define native methods, to start programs, to read or
    write files,\n   or to read system properties.\n"
