- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   This document describes the conventions for using several\n\
    \   cryptographic algorithms with the EncryptedPrivateKeyInfo structure\n   [RFC5958].\
    \  The EncryptedPrivateKeyInfo is used by [P12] to encrypt\n   PrivateKeyInfo\
    \ [RFC5958].  It is similar to EncryptedData [RFC5652]\n   in that it has no recipients,\
    \ no originators, and no content\n   encryption keys and requires keys to be managed\
    \ by other means.\n   This document also includes conventions necessary to protect\
    \ the\n   AsymmetricKeyPackage content type [RFC5958] with Cryptographic\n   Message\
    \ Syntax (CMS) protecting content types: SignedData [RFC5652],\n   EnvelopedData\
    \ [RFC5652], EncryptedData [RFC5652], AuthenticatedData\n   [RFC5652], and AuthEnvelopedData\
    \ [RFC5083].  Implementations of\n   AsymmetricKeyPackage do not require support\
    \ for any CMS protecting\n   content type; however, if the AsymmetricKeyPackage\
    \ is CMS protected\n   it is RECOMMENDED that conventions defined herein be followed.\n\
    \   This document does not define any new algorithms instead it refers to\n  \
    \ previously defined algorithms.\n"

    SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\"\
    , and \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n   document are to be interpreted as described in\
    \ [RFC2119].\n"
- title: 2.  EncryptedPrivateKeyInfo
  contents:
  - "2.  EncryptedPrivateKeyInfo\n   The de facto standard used to encrypt the PrivateKeyInfo\
    \ structure,\n   which is subsequently placed in the EncryptedPrivateKeyInfo\n\
    \   encryptedData field, is Password Based Encryption (PBE) based on PKCS\n  \
    \ #5 [RFC2898] and PKCS #12 [P12].  The major difference between PKCS\n   #5 and\
    \ PKCS #12 is the supported encoding for the password: ASCII for\n   PKCS #5 and\
    \ Unicode for PKCS #12, encoded as specified in Section B.1\n   of [P12].  [RFC2898]\
    \ specifies two PBE Schemes (PBES) 1 and 2;\n   [RFC2898] recommends PBES2 for\
    \ new specification.  PBES2 with a key\n   derivation algorithm of PBKDF2 using\
    \ HMAC with SHA-256 [RFC5754] and\n   an encryption algorithm of AES Key Wrap\
    \ with Padding as defined in\n   [RFC5649] MUST be supported.  AES-256 Key Wrap\
    \ with Padding [RFC5649]\n   MAY also be supported as an encryption algorithm.\n"
- title: 3.  AsymmetricKeyPackage
  contents:
  - "3.  AsymmetricKeyPackage\n   As noted in Asymmetric Key Packages [RFC5958], CMS\
    \ can be used to\n   protect the AsymmetricKeyPackage.  The following provides\
    \ guidance\n   for SignedData [RFC5652], EnvelopedData [RFC5652], EncryptedData\n\
    \   [RFC5652], AuthenticatedData [RFC5652], and AuthEnvelopedData\n   [RFC5083].\n"
- title: 3.1.  SignedData
  contents:
  - "3.1.  SignedData\n   If an implementation supports SignedData, then it MUST support\
    \ the\n   signature scheme RSA [RFC3370] [RFC5754] and SHOULD support the\n  \
    \ signature schemes RSASSA-PSS [RFC4056] and DSA [RFC3370] [RFC5754].\n   Additionally,\
    \ implementations MUST support in concert with these\n   signature schemes the\
    \ hash function SHA-256 [RFC5754] and SHOULD\n   support the hash function SHA-1\
    \ [RFC3370].\n"
- title: 3.2.  EnvelopedData
  contents:
  - "3.2.  EnvelopedData\n   If an implementation supports EnvelopedData, then it\
    \ MUST implement\n   key transport and it MAY implement key agreement.\n   When\
    \ key transport is used, RSA encryption [RFC3370] MUST be\n   supported and RSAES-OAEP\
    \ (RSA Encryption Scheme - Optimal Asymmetric\n   Encryption Padding) [RFC3560]\
    \ SHOULD be supported.\n   When key agreement is used, Diffie-Hellman (DH) ephemeral-static\n\
    \   [RFC3370] MUST be supported.\n   Since the content type is used to carry a\
    \ cryptographic key and its\n   attributes, an algorithm that is traditionally\
    \ used to encrypt one\n   key with another is employed.  Regardless of the key\
    \ management\n   technique choice, implementations MUST support AES-128 Key Wrap\
    \ with\n   Padding [RFC5649] as the content encryption algorithm.\n   Implementations\
    \ SHOULD support AES-256 Key Wrap with Padding\n   [RFC5649] as the content encryption\
    \ algorithm.\n   When key agreement is used, a key wrap algorithm is also specified\
    \ to\n   wrap the content encryption key.  If the content encryption algorithm\n\
    \   is AES-128 Key Wrap with Padding, then the key wrap algorithm MUST be\n  \
    \ AES-128 Key Wrap with Padding [RFC5649].  If the content encryption\n   algorithm\
    \ is AES-256 Key Wrap with Padding, then the key wrap\n   algorithm MUST be AES-256\
    \ Key Wrap with Padding [RFC5649].\n"
- title: 3.3.  EncryptedData
  contents:
  - "3.3.  EncryptedData\n   If an implementation supports EncryptedData, then it\
    \ MUST implement\n   AES-128 Key Wrap with Padding [RFC5649] and SHOULD implement\
    \ AES-256\n   Key Wrap with Padding [RFC5649].\n   NOTE: EncryptedData requires\
    \ that keys be managed by other means;\n   therefore, the only algorithm specified\
    \ is the content encryption\n   algorithm.  Since the content type is used to\
    \ carry a cryptographic\n   key and its attributes, an algorithm that is traditionally\
    \ used to\n   encrypt one key with another is employed.\n"
- title: 3.4.  AuthenticatedData
  contents:
  - "3.4.  AuthenticatedData\n   If an implementation supports AuthenticatedData,\
    \ then it MUST\n   implement SHA-256 [RFC5754] and SHOULD support SHA-1 [RFC3370]\
    \ as the\n   message digest algorithm.  Additionally, HMAC with SHA-256 [RFC4231]\n\
    \   MUST be supported and HMAC with SHA-1 [RFC3370] SHOULD be supported.\n"
- title: 3.5.  AuthEnvelopedData
  contents:
  - "3.5.  AuthEnvelopedData\n   If an implementation supports AuthEnvelopedData,\
    \ then it MUST\n   implement the EnvelopedData recommendations except for the\
    \ content\n   encryption algorithm, which in this case MUST be AES-GCM [RFC5084];\n\
    \   the 128-bit version MUST be implemented and the 256-bit version\n   SHOULD\
    \ be implemented.  Implementations MAY also support for AES-CCM\n   [RFC5084].\n"
- title: 4.  Public Key Sizes
  contents:
  - "4.  Public Key Sizes\n   The easiest way to implement the SignedData, EnvelopedData,\
    \ and\n   AuthEnvelopedData is with public key certificates [RFC5280].  If an\n\
    \   implementation support RSA, RSASSA-PSS, DSS, RSAES-OAEP, or DH, then\n   it\
    \ MUST support key lengths from 1024-bit to 2048-bit, inclusive.\n"
- title: 5.  SMIMECapabilities Attribute
  contents:
  - "5.  SMIMECapabilities Attribute\n   [RFC5751] defines the SMIMECapabilities attribute\
    \ as a mechanism for\n   recipients to indicate their supported capabilities including\
    \ the\n   algorithms they support.  The following are values for the\n   SMIMECapabilities\
    \ attribute for AES Key Wrap with Padding [RFC5649]\n   when used as a content\
    \ encryption algorithm:\n   AES-128 KW with Padding: 30 0d 06 09 60 86 48 01 65\
    \ 03 04 01 08\n   AES-192 KW with Padding: 30 0d 06 09 60 86 48 01 65 03 04 01\
    \ 1C\n   AES-256 KW with Padding: 30 0d 06 09 60 86 48 01 65 03 04 01 30\n"
- title: 6.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "6.  Security Considerations\n   The security considerations from [RFC3370], [RFC3560],\
    \ [RFC4056],\n   [RFC4231], [RFC5083], [RFC5084], [RFC5649], [RFC5652], [RFC5754],\
    \ and\n   [RFC5958] apply.\n   The strength of any encryption scheme is only as\
    \ good as its weakest\n   link, which in the case of a PBES is the password. \
    \ Passwords need to\n   provide sufficient entropy to ensure they cannot be easily\
    \ guessed.\n   The U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)\n\
    \   Electronic Authentication Guidance [SP800-63] provides some\n   information\
    \ on password entropy.  [SP800-63] indicates that a user-\n   chosen 20-character\
    \ password from a 94-character keyboard with no\n   checks provides 36 bits of\
    \ entropy.  If the 20-character password is\n   randomly chosen, then the amount\
    \ of entropy is increased to roughly\n   131 bits of entropy.  The amount of entropy\
    \ in the password does not\n   correlate directly to bits of security but in general\
    \ the more than\n   the better.\n   The choice of content encryption algorithms\
    \ for this document was\n   based on [RFC5649]: \"In the design of some high assurance\n\
    \   cryptographic modules, it is desirable to segregate cryptographic\n   keying\
    \ material from other data.  The use of a specific cryptographic\n   mechanism\
    \ solely for the protection of cryptographic keying material\n   can assist in\
    \ this goal\".  Unfortunately, there is no AES-GCM or AES-\n   CCM mode that provides\
    \ the same properties.  If an AES-GCM and AES-\n   CCM mode that provides the\
    \ same properties is defined, then this\n   document will be updated to adopt\
    \ that algorithm.\n   [SP800-57] provides comparable bits of security for some\
    \ algorithms\n   and key sizes.  [SP800-57] also provides time frames during which\n\
    \   certain numbers of bits of security are appropriate and some\n   environments\
    \ may find these time frames useful.\n"
