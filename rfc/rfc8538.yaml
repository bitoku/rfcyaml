  contents:
  - "Abstract\n   The BGP Graceful Restart mechanism defined in RFC 4724 limits the\n\
    \   usage of BGP Graceful Restart to BGP messages other than BGP\n   NOTIFICATION\
    \ messages.  This document updates RFC 4724 by defining an\n   extension that\
    \ permits the Graceful Restart procedures to be\n   performed when the BGP speaker\
    \ receives a BGP NOTIFICATION message or\n   the Hold Time expires.  This document\
    \ also defines a new subcode for\n   BGP Cease NOTIFICATION messages; this new\
    \ subcode requests a full\n   session restart instead of a Graceful Restart.\n"

  - "1.  Introduction\n   For many classes of errors, BGP must send a NOTIFICATION\
    \ message and\n   reset the peering session to handle the error condition.  The\
    \ BGP\n   Graceful Restart mechanism defined in [RFC4724] requires that normal\n\
    \   BGP procedures defined in [RFC4271] be followed when a NOTIFICATION\n   message\
    \ is sent or received.  This document defines an extension to\n   BGP Graceful\
    \ Restart that permits the Graceful Restart procedures to\n   be performed when\
    \ the BGP speaker receives a NOTIFICATION message or\n   the Hold Time expires.\
    \  This permits the BGP speaker to avoid\n   flapping reachability and continue\
    \ forwarding while the BGP speaker\n   restarts the session to handle errors detected\
    \ in BGP.\n   At a high level, this document can be summed up as follows.  When\
    \ a\n   BGP session is reset, both speakers operate as \"Receiving Speakers\"\n\
    \   according to [RFC4724], meaning they retain each other's routes.\n   This\
    \ is also true for HOLDTIME expiration.  The functionality can be\n   defeated\
    \ by sending a BGP Cease NOTIFICATION message with the Hard\n   Reset subcode.\
    \  If a Hard Reset is used, a full session reset is\n   performed.\n"

  contents:
  - "1.1.  Requirements Language\n   The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\"\
    , \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"\
    NOT RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and\n   \"OPTIONAL\" in this document are to be interpreted\
    \ as described in\n   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear\
    \ in all\n   capitals, as shown here.\n"
- title: 2.  Modifications to BGP Graceful Restart Capability
  contents:
  - "2.  Modifications to BGP Graceful Restart Capability\n   The BGP Graceful Restart\
    \ Capability is augmented to signal the\n   Graceful Restart support for BGP NOTIFICATION\
    \ messages.  The Restart\n   Flags field is augmented as follows (following the\
    \ diagram in\n   Section 3 of [RFC4724]).\n   Restart Flags:\n         This field\
    \ contains bit flags relating to restart.\n                0 1 2 3\n         \
    \      +-+-+-+-+\n               |R|N|   |\n               +-+-+-+-+\n   The most\
    \ significant bit is defined in [RFC4724] as the Restart State\n   (\"R\") bit.\n\
    \   The second most significant bit is defined in this document as the\n   Graceful\
    \ Notification (\"N\") bit.  It is used to indicate Graceful\n   Restart support\
    \ for BGP NOTIFICATION messages.  A BGP speaker\n   indicates support for the\
    \ procedures in this document by advertising\n   a Graceful Restart Capability\
    \ with its \"N\" bit set (value 1).\n   If a BGP speaker that previously advertised\
    \ a given set of Graceful\n   Restart parameters opens a new session with a different\
    \ set of\n   parameters, these new parameters apply once the session has\n   transitioned\
    \ into ESTABLISHED state.\n"
- title: 3.  BGP Hard Reset Subcode
  contents:
  - "3.  BGP Hard Reset Subcode\n   This document defines a new subcode for BGP Cease\
    \ NOTIFICATION\n   messages, called the Hard Reset subcode.  The value of this\
    \ subcode\n   is discussed in Section 8.  In this document, a BGP Cease\n   NOTIFICATION\
    \ message with the Hard Reset subcode is referred to as a\n   \"Hard Reset message\"\
    \ or simply as a \"Hard Reset\".\n   When the \"N\" bit has been exchanged by\
    \ two peers, NOTIFICATION\n   messages other than Hard Reset messages are referred\
    \ to as\n   \"Graceful\", since such messages invoke Graceful Restart semantics.\n"
- title: 3.1.  Sending a Hard Reset
  contents:
  - "3.1.  Sending a Hard Reset\n   When the \"N\" bit has been exchanged, a Hard\
    \ Reset message is used to\n   indicate to the peer that the session is to be\
    \ fully terminated.\n   When sending a Hard Reset, the data portion of the NOTIFICATION\n\
    \   message is encoded as follows:\n       +--------+--------+--------\n     \
    \  | ErrCode| Subcode| Data\n       +--------+--------+--------\n   ErrCode is\
    \ a BGP Error Code (as documented in the IANA \"BGP Error\n   (Notification) Codes\"\
    \ registry) that indicates the reason for the\n   Hard Reset.  Subcode is a BGP\
    \ Error Subcode (as documented in the\n   IANA \"BGP Error Subcodes\" registry)\
    \ as appropriate for the ErrCode.\n   Similarly, Data is as appropriate for the\
    \ ErrCode and Subcode.  In\n   short, the Hard Reset encapsulates another NOTIFICATION\
    \ message in\n   its data portion.\n"
- title: 3.2.  Receiving a Hard Reset
  contents:
  - "3.2.  Receiving a Hard Reset\n   Whenever a BGP speaker receives a Hard Reset,\
    \ the speaker MUST\n   terminate the BGP session following the standard procedures\
    \ in\n   [RFC4271].\n"
- title: 4.  Operation
  contents:
  - "4.  Operation\n   A BGP speaker that is willing to receive and send BGP NOTIFICATION\n\
    \   messages according to the procedures of this document MUST advertise\n   the\
    \ \"N\" bit using the Graceful Restart Capability as defined in\n   [RFC4724].\n\
    \   When such a BGP speaker has received the \"N\" bit from its peer, and\n  \
    \ receives from that peer a BGP NOTIFICATION message other than a Hard\n   Reset,\
    \ it MUST follow the rules for the Receiving Speaker mentioned\n   in Section\
    \ 4.1.  The BGP speaker generating the BGP NOTIFICATION\n   message MUST also\
    \ follow the rules for the Receiving Speaker.\n   When a BGP speaker resets its\
    \ session due to a HOLDTIME expiry, it\n   should generate the relevant BGP NOTIFICATION\
    \ message as mentioned in\n   [RFC4271] but subsequently MUST follow the rules\
    \ for the Receiving\n   Speaker mentioned in Section 4.1.\n   A BGP speaker SHOULD\
    \ NOT send a Hard Reset to a peer from which it\n   has not received the \"N\"\
    \ bit.  We note, however, that if it did so,\n   the effect would be as desired\
    \ in any case because, according to\n   [RFC4271] and [RFC4724], any NOTIFICATION\
    \ message, whether recognized\n   or not, results in a session reset.  Thus, the\
    \ only negative effect\n   to be expected from sending the Hard Reset to a peer\
    \ that hasn't\n   advertised compliance to this specification would be that the\
    \ peer\n   would be unable to properly log the associated information.\n   Once\
    \ the session is re-established, both BGP speakers SHOULD set\n   their Forwarding\
    \ State bit to 1.  If the Forwarding State bit is not\n   set, then, according\
    \ to the procedures in Section 4.2 of [RFC4724],\n   the relevant routes will\
    \ be flushed, defeating the goals of this\n   specification.\n"
- title: 4.1.  Rules for the Receiving Speaker
  contents:
  - "4.1.  Rules for the Receiving Speaker\n   Section 4.2 of [RFC4724] defines rules\
    \ for the Receiving Speaker.\n   This document modifies those rules as follows:\n\
    \   The sentence \"To deal with possible consecutive restarts, a route\n   (from\
    \ the peer) previously marked as stale MUST be deleted\" only\n   applies when\
    \ the \"N\" bit has not been exchanged with the peer:\n   OLD: When the Receiving\
    \ Speaker detects termination of the TCP\n        session for a BGP session with\
    \ a peer that has advertised the\n        Graceful Restart Capability, it MUST\
    \ retain the routes received\n        from the peer for all the address families\
    \ that were previously\n        received in the Graceful Restart Capability and\
    \ MUST mark them\n        as stale routing information.  To deal with possible\
    \ consecutive\n        restarts, a route (from the peer) previously marked as\
    \ stale\n        MUST be deleted.  The router MUST NOT differentiate between\n\
    \        stale and other routing information during forwarding.\n   NEW: When\
    \ the Receiving Speaker detects termination of the TCP\n        session for a\

  - "5.1.  When to Send a Hard Reset\n   Although when to send a Hard Reset is an\
    \ implementation-specific\n   decision, we offer some advice.  Many Cease NOTIFICATION\
    \ subcodes\n   represent permanent or long-term, rather than transient, session\n\
    \   termination.  Because of this, it's appropriate to use Hard Reset\n   with\
    \ them.  As of publication of this document, subcodes 1-9 have\n   been defined\
    \ for Cease.  The following table lists each of these\n   subcodes along with\

    \ can continue or that the session\n   will be re-established within the deadline,\
    \ Hard Reset should be\n   used.\n   For all NOTIFICATION codes other than Cease,\
