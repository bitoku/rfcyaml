  - "1.  Introduction\n   The RFC Editor is both the publisher and the archivist for\
    \ the RFC\n   Series, a series of technical specifications and policy documents\n\
    \   that includes foundational Internet standards [RFC6635] [RFC-SERIES].\n  \
    \ The goal of the RFC Editor is to is to produce clear, consistent, and\n   readable\
    \ documents for the Internet community.  Over time, the RFC\n   Editor will use\
    \ as many modern features, such as hyperlinks and\n   content markup, within the\
    \ document as necessary to convey the\n   information the authors intended for\
    \ their audience.  As the\n   archivist, however, the main goal is to preserve\
    \ both the information\n   described and the documents themselves for the indefinite\
    \ future.  To\n   meet both of these goals, the RFC Editor must find the necessary\n\
    \   balance between the publication needs of today and the archival needs\n  \
    \ of tomorrow, while acknowledging a finite set of resources to\n   complete both\
    \ aspects of the RFC Editor function.\n   While many files are created during\
    \ the editing process, this\n   document focuses on the archival needs of the\
    \ Internet-Drafts (I-Ds)\n   that were approved for publication and the RFCs that\
    \ resulted from\n   these I-Ds; I-Ds before they are approved for publication\
    \ by the\n   appropriate stream-approving body are out of scope.\n   To summarize,\
    \ the key areas of tension between the roles of publisher\n   and archivist are:\n\
    \   o  the desire of the publisher to meet the needs expressed by authors\n  \
    \    who want to use the latest technology (e.g., vector graphics, live\n    \
    \  links, and a rich set of metadata) within their documents; and\n   o  the desire\
    \ of the archivist to support only the simplest format\n      for documents possible\
    \ -- currently held by the Series to be\n      plain-text, ASCII-only documents\
    \ -- so that the tools needed to\n      view the documents are equally simple\
    \ and resistant to changes in\n      technology, resulting in a set of documents\
    \ that will be easier to\n      archive for at least the next several decades,\
    \ if not centuries.\n   Through most of the history of the RFC Series, the file\
    \ format for\n   RFCs has been plain text with an ASCII-only character set.  This\n\
    \   choice offered the simplest format likely to remain available to the\n   largest\
    \ number of consumers and the format most likely to be\n   resistant to changes\
    \ in technology over time.  Increasingly, however,\n   consumers and authors are\
    \ requesting additional features that would\n   allow for easy reading on a wider\
    \ array of devices while retaining\n   all the metadata authors intended in their\
    \ documents.  In 2013, RFC\n   6949 (\"RFC Series Format Requirements and Future\
    \ Development\")\n   captured the high-level requirements for the Series; the\
    \ fundamental\n   issue was that plain-text, ASCII-only documents no longer meet\
    \ the\n   needs of the communities interested in using and producing RFCs\n  \
    \ [RFC6949].\n   The assertion that plain-text, ASCII-only documents no longer\
    \ meet\n   the needs of the community suggests that the simple archival process\n\
    \   maintained by the RFC Editor is also no longer sufficient.  More\n   complex\
    \ tools and file formats require a more complex process to\n   ensure that RFCs\
    \ can be read and rendered far into the future.  This\n   document describes the\
    \ considerations that must inform any changes in\n   policy and procedure, and\
    \ it describes a model for the RFC Series to\n   follow when additional formats\
    \ beyond plain-text, ASCII-only RFCs are\n   published.  The functional model\
    \ that provides the framework for the\n   archival process described in this document\
    \ was derived from the ISO\n   Open Archival Information System (OAIS) reference\
    \ model, defined in\n   \"Space data and information transfer systems -- Open\
    \ archival\n   information system (OAIS) -- Reference model\" [ISO14721].\n"

- title: 1.2.  Life Cycle of Digital Preservation
  contents:
  - "1.2.  Life Cycle of Digital Preservation\n   The basic process for preserving\
    \ digital information has been\n   described by a variety of organizations.  From\
    \ the Life cycle\n   Information For E-Literature (LIFE) project [LIFE] in the\
    \ United\n   Kingdom to the ongoing digital preservation work in the U.S. Library\n\
    \   of Congress [USLOC], the basic digital preservation process is\n   straightforward.\
    \  Documents are acquired and processed, metadata is\n   recorded, physical media\
    \ is refreshed, and content is regularly\n   checked to see if it is still accessible\
    \ by interested parties.\n   Complexities arise when one considers the need to\
    \ preserve both the\n   bits of the digital objects themselves and the tools with\
    \ which to\n   express those bits in an environment that experiences rapid changes\n\
    \   in technology.\n   For most of the existence of the RFC Series, the digital\
    \ preservation\n   process has been fairly simple, focusing on bitstream preservation\n\
    \   and relying on paper copies of digital files.\n   The current archival process\
    \ for the RFC Series is as follows:\n   1.  Acquisition: The RFC Editor database\
    \ is updated to indicate an\n       I-D has been approved for publication.  At\
    \ this point, the\n       document is taken through the editorial process on the\
    \ way to\n       publication [RFC-PUB].\n   2.  Ingestion: The RFC is added to\
    \ the archive at the time of\n       publication.\n   3.  Metadata creation: The\
    \ details regarding an RFC, including RFC\n       number, author, title, abstract,\
    \ etc., are created at time of\n       publication.  Additional metadata in the\
    \ form of status and\n       errata can be added or changed at any time, following\
    \ the process\n       of the originating document stream.\n   4.  Bitstream preservation:\
    \ This part of the process is handled as\n       part of the IT system administration;\
    \ all servers, disks, and\n       backup technology are refreshed on a regular\
    \ cycle.\n   5.  Content preservation: All RFCs since January 2010 have been\n\
    \       printed out on standard office paper at time of publication, and\n   \
    \    the electronic files have been preserved on disk and in backups\n       with\
    \ no particular focus on preserving the entire computing\n       environment used\
    \ to create the electronic documents.  Most RFCs\n       prior to January 2010\
    \ are also available on paper, but there are\n       gaps in the record and issues\
    \ of ownership around the paper\n       copies before that date.\n   When the\
    \ format for RFCs transitions from plain-text, ASCII-only\n   files to an XML\
    \ format with multiple outputs, the overall archival\n   process will become more\
    \ complex.  Additional metadata and some (or\n   possibly all) of the computing\
    \ environment may need to be added to\n   the archive.\n"
- title: 2.  Updating Policy and Procedure
  contents:
  - "2.  Updating Policy and Procedure\n   RFCs are created and published as digital\
    \ objects.  Unlike paper-\n   based publications, a digital collection requires\
    \ a focus on\n   retaining the details of the technology as well as retaining\
    \ the\n   object itself.  Specifically, a digital archive needs to:\n   o  consider\
    \ the inherent instability of digital media,\n   o  plan for a relatively short\
    \ path to technological obsolescence,\n   o  schedule regular media updates,\n\
    \   o  apply predefined criteria for technology evaluation, and\n   o  ensure\
    \ the continued authenticity and integrity of documents\n      through any changes\
    \ in technology.\n   As the custodian and canonical source of RFCs and associated\
    \ errata,\n   the RFC Editor must consider how to ensure the availability and\n\
    \   integrity of this document series far into the future and determine\n   whether\
    \ the focus must be on bitstream preservation, content\n   preservation, or both.\n\
    \   The RFC Editor has several advantages in acting as the digital\n   archivist\
    \ for the Series.  Since the RFC Editor is the publisher as\n   well as the archivist,\
    \ the RFC Editor controls the format of the\n   material and the process for adding\
    \ that material to an archive and\n   can add any additional metadata considered\
    \ necessary.  External\n   material, while a major consideration for more general\
    \ archives, is\n   no longer accepted by the RFC Editor.  (See \"Internet Archaeology:\n\
    \   Documents from Early History\" [RFC-HISTORY] for the list of non-RFC\n   digital\
    \ objects held by the RFC Editor.)\n   This document describes several different\
    \ preservation models that\n   may fit the needs of the Series and raises several\
    \ points for\n   community consideration.  Specifically, this document covers\n\
    \   information on:\n   o  Acquisition of documents\n   o  Ingestion of documents\n\
    \   o  Metadata and document registration\n   o  Normalization and standardization\
    \ of canonical file structure and\n      format\n   o  Transformation/migration\
    \ to current publication formats\n   o  Content and computing environment preservation\n\
    \   o  System parameters\n   o  Financial impact\n"
- title: 2.1.  Acquisition of Documents
  contents:
  - "2.1.  Acquisition of Documents\n   The acquisition process for documents intended\
    \ for the archive starts\n   with the submission of an approved I-D for publication.\
    \  During the\n   editorial process, information such as the document metadata\
    \ is\n   finalized prior to publication.  However, the initial I-D as\n   submitted\
    \ and the RFC produced from it do not formally enter the\n   archive until the\
    \ time of publication, which is considered the point\n   of ingestion from an\
    \ archival perspective.\n"
- title: 2.2.  Ingestion of Documents
  contents:
  - "2.2.  Ingestion of Documents\n   Once an RFC is published, the canonical format\
    \ is considered\n   immutable.  At this point, the RFC Production Center, one\
    \ of the\n   internal roles within the RFC Editor, assigns the document metadata\n\
    \   that an archivist needs to identify the unique object.\n   In the case of\
    \ RFCs, the metadata assigned to a document at the time\n   of publication includes:\n\
    \   o  the RFC number\n   o  ISSN\n   o  publication date\n   o  Digital Object\
    \ Identifier (DOI)\n   Additional metadata, such as author name, is assigned earlier\
    \ in the\n   document creation process, but it is subject to change up to the\n\
    \   point of publication.  More information on metadata is available in\n   Section\
    \ 2.3 (\"Metadata and Document Registration\").\n   In terms of deciding what\
    \ to accept in the archive -- a major\n   question for most archives and yet a\
    \ simple one for the RFC Series --\n   the RFC Editor accepts documents that are\
    \ approved for publication by\n   the approving body of one of the document streams:\
    \ the IETF, IAB,\n   IRTF, or Independent Submission streams [RFC7841].  Each\
    \ document\n   stream has defined processes on when and how I-Ds are approved\
    \ and\n   submitted to the RFC Editor for publication.  The RFC Editor does not\n\
    \   select documents for publication and archiving; the RFC Editor edits\n   and\
    \ publishes documents approved for publication by the document\n   streams.\n\
    \   The RFC Editor holds no copyright on I-Ds or RFCs.  As per the IETF\n   Trust\
    \ Legal Provisions [TLP], the copyright for RFCs is held by the\n   authors and\
    \ the IETF Trust.  At any point in time, the current\n   entities providing RFC\
    \ Editor services must be able to release the\n   archive of RFCs to the IETF\
    \ Trust.\n   Note: The RFC Editor is currently only responsible for RFCs; any\n\
    \   associated datasets or other research data is not considered within\n   the\
    \ RFC Editor's mandate at this time; therefore, no consideration to\n   the archival\
    \ requirements of such datasets is covered in this\n   document.\n"
- title: 2.3.  Metadata and Document Registration
  contents:
  - "2.3.  Metadata and Document Registration\n   Metadata is data about data.  In\
    \ the field of digital archiving, this\n   is the data that clearly identifies\
    \ every aspect of a document, from\n   its identifier (i.e., the RFC number and\
    \ the I-D draft string) to the\n   size and file format of the document and more.\
    \  Metadata is stored in\n   a central registry that records information on exactly\
    \ what is being\n   preserved and where it is located, information on authenticity\
    \ and\n   provenance, and details on the hardware and/or software needed to\n\
    \   view or create the documents.\n   The RFC Editor maintains this registry in\
    \ the form of a database that\n   includes all metadata available for documents\
    \ being edited and for\n   published RFCs.  This database feeds the search engine\
    \ on the RFC\n   Editor website and the info pages available for every RFC (e.g.,\n\
    \   http://www.rfc-editor.org/info/rfc####).\n   Following is the current list\

    \ practice, all documents used as normative references\n   within an RFC would\
    \ also be stored in the archive.  While this is\n   done automatically when the\
    \ normative reference is another RFC (the\n   usual case), retaining a copy of\

  - "2.4.  Normalization and Standardization of Canonical File Structure and\n   \
    \   Format\n   The normalization process is perhaps the most technically critical\n\
    \   part of digital archiving.  The purpose is content preservation --\n   making\
    \ sure the data accepted for archiving are in the most stable\n   and easily accessed\
    \ formats possible for the long-term future and\n   require the least amount of\
    \ re-engineering and emulation of\n   environments in order to view the document\
    \ in the future.\n   Normalization is about enabling long-term access to the information\n\
    \   within a document.\n   Over the history of the RFC Series, documents have\
    \ been submitted for\n   publication in a variety of formats, including paper\
    \ for the earliest\n   RFCs.  Today, the majority of RFCs are available in both\
    \ a canonical\n   plain-text format and PDF format.  For exceptions, see the RFC\
    \ Online\n   Project [RFC-ONLINE].\n   Currently, all RFCs are printed out to\
    \ paper and stored at time of\n   publication.  This has been a reasonable backup\
    \ plan for several\n   decades.  With few of the features one might expect from\
    \ a digital\n   document format (such as links, metadata within the document,\
    \ and\n   line drawings), plain-text files do not lose much, if any,\n   information\
    \ when printed out to paper.  However, as the published\n   formats change (see\
    \ RFC 6949), printing to paper provides less value\n   as much of the metadata\
    \ that is an intrinsic yet invisible part of\n   the rendered document will be\
    \ lost in such printing.  With that in\n   mind, the focus needs to change to\
    \ preserving the new file formats\n   electronically.\n   While each RFC today\
    \ is printed to paper and all electronic versions\n   stored on multiple hard\
    \ drives, no particular effort is made to\n   ensure copies of the software used\
    \ to render or read the canonical\n   plain-text RFC are also archived.  The RFC\
    \ Editor has several choices\n   on how to adapt to the need to archive a more\
    \ complex set of data and\n   follow best practice as defined by the digital archive\
    \ community:\n   o  a simplified bitstream preservation model that focuses on\
    \ standard\n      \"best effort\" data-retention practices, which rely on backups,\n\
    \      upgrades, and regular equipment change to preserve the data.  This\n  \
    \    model assumes that emulators may be built when needed if the\n      formats\
    \ used go out of common use (a significant part of the model\n      currently\
    \ followed by the RFC Editor).\n   o  a content preservation model that focuses\
    \ on one publication\n      format as the version most likely to be viewable and\
    \ provide all\n      necessary metadata in the future.  This is a viable option\n\
    \      considering that PDF/A-3 [PDF], one of the intended publication\n     \
    \ formats, was designed for this type of archiving.\n   o  a complex bitstream\
    \ and content preservation model that focuses on\n      archiving the canonical\
    \ XML and the entire computing environment\n      required to create, view and\
    \ render all outputs from that file.\n      This is the \"best practice\" from\
    \ an archivist's perspective.\n   Those options are listed in order of least to\
    \ greatest complexity and\n   expense.  More detail on each option is described\
    \ below.\n"

  contents:
  - "2.4.1.  'Best Effort' Data Retention\n   When dealing with very simple data structures\
    \ such as plain-text,\n   ASCII-only files, the experience of the RFC Series suggests\
    \ that for\n   the last few decades, hardware and operating system changes have\
    \ had\n   minimal impact on the document files being stored.  While a complete\n\
    \   failure of an operating system migration corrupted the dataset in the\n  \
    \ past, that situation represents a somewhat different problem than the\n   tools\
    \ themselves changing such that plain-text files are not easily\n   read with\
    \ existing technology.  Given that the basic plain-text\n   format and ASCII encoding\
    \ remain in common use, the standard\n   protections against file corruption and\
    \ data loss, such as disk\n   mirroring, off-site backups, and periodic restoration\
    \ testing, will\n   continue to provide access to the entirety of the RFC Series\
    \ for the\n   foreseeable future.  As has been pointed out, both in this document\n\
    \   and in broader community discussion, that is not sufficient for\n   complex\
    \ formats such as XML, HTML, PDF, or other proprietary formats\n   offered by\
    \ today's large IT companies.  The risk of technological\n   change resulting\
    \ in the file formats mentioned being deprecated or\n   changed without backwards\
    \ compatibility is fairly high when looking\n   decades or centuries into the\
    \ future.\n   It is recommended that this model of archiving the RFC Series cease\n\
    \   to be the primary model after the plain-text, ASCII-only format is no\n  \
    \ longer the canonical format.  Best effort data retention is a\n   necessary\
    \ but not sufficient level of effort for preserving a digital\n   archive.  For\
    \ more guidance on how to define best effort data\n   retention, the section on\
    \ \"Media and Formats, Summary\n   Recommendations\" in the 2009 version of the\

    \ this route, such\n   as Archivematica [ARCHIVEMATICA].  By selecting a feature-rich\
    \ yet\n   fundamentally stable file format for documents, an organization may\n\
    \   avoid expensive whole-environment reconstruction in order to view the\n  \
    \ document.  The PDF/A formats were designed to be an archival format\n   for\
    \ electronic documents, and PDF/A-3 is one of the options intended\n   for publication\
    \ as the RFC Series moves from a plain-text canonical\n   format to an XML canonical\
    \ format with multiple publication formats.\n   A PDF/A-3 file can be produced\
    \ that embeds the XML from which the\n   PDF/A-3 file was created; this allows\
    \ for both original and rendered\n   document validation if one has the correct\
    \ tools available to see the\n   source of the PDF/A-3 file [RFC7995].  The XML\
    \ is not otherwise\n   visible when viewing the PDF/A-3 file through typical PDF\
    \ reader\n   software.\n   When looking at the need to archive RFCs in a resource-limited\n\
    \   environment, a content-preservation-only model has merit, but it is\n   not\
    \ without risks.  First, PDF/A-3 will not be the canonical format;\n   it is intended\
    \ to be one of the rendered outputs.  It may contain\n   rendering bugs that were\
    \ not intended to be in the document.  Second,\n   while the various PDF/A formats\
    \ were designed to be archival, they\n   have not been put to the test of time\
    \ to determine if they will\n   actually live up to the design goals.\n   This\
    \ is a valid option to consider, but the risks, priorities, and\n   costs must\
    \ be discussed by the community before a decision is made to\n   follow this path.\
    \  The best option may be to combine this with one of\n   the other methods of\
    \ archiving described in this document to help\n   minimize both risk and cost.\n"

  - "2.4.3.  Holistic Archiving of the Computing Environment\n   Preserving everything\
    \ published by the RFC Editor in order to have a\n   permanent record of information,\
    \ standards, and best practice is\n   arguably the whole point of being an archival\
    \ series.  One can argue\n   that it is not only about the information described\
    \ in an RFC, it is\n   also about supporting Intellectual Property Rights (IPR)\
    \ and\n   retaining the history of the Internet.  In following this model,\n \
    \  however, one must consider the complexity of the archival environment\n   as\
    \ matching, and possibly exceeding, the complexity of the file\n   formats being\
    \ preserved.\n   Consider a future where XML has been obsoleted for half a century,\n\
    \   HTML5 was a format used three to four human generations ago, and PDF/\n  \
    \ A-3 is no longer supported by any existing company's reading\n   software. \
    \ For RFCs that were produced with XML as their canonical\n   format, an archive\
    \ must not only hold the data, it must also hold the\n   entire computing environment\
    \ that allows the data to be rendered and\n   viewed.  Operating systems and hardware\
    \ on which those OSs can run,\n   each major version of each piece of software\
    \ used or relied upon\n   during the publication of an RFC, browsers and readers\
    \ for HTML, PDF,\n   and any other publication format must be preserved in some\
    \ fashion.\n   This is considered best practice when archiving digital documents.\n\
    \   This is also the most expensive method, and the cost only increases\n   over\
    \ time as more and more instances of the computing environment\n   must be preserved\
    \ over the lifetime of the Series.\n   This is a valid option to consider, but\
    \ the sheer scope of resources\n   required suggests that this must be discussed\
    \ by the community before\n   a decision is made.  Pursuing this may require an\
    \ entirely different\n   paradigm for the RFC Editor from what has been considered\
    \ in the\n   past; expanding the scope and resources for the RFC Editor, finding\
    \ a\n   third party to take over the responsibilities of archiving, or some\n\
    \   other option may be necessary.\n"

  - "2.5.  Transformation/Migration to Current Publication Formats\n   Because normalization\
    \ is a complex subject, it is important to\n   consider how to mitigate the risk\
    \ of failure of the normalization\n   process.\n   The RFC Editor is responsible\
    \ for making RFCs available to the\n   Internet community.  The canonical version\
    \ of an RFC does not change\n   once published; any formats officially rendered\
    \ from the canonical\n   version, however, may change.  One way to mitigate the\
    \ need to\n   preserve the entire computing environment for an RFC, including\
    \ web\n   browsers and PDF readers, would be to take advantage of the non-\n \
    \  canonical nature of the publication formats and re-render them from\n   the\
    \ canonical source at the point that browser or reader technology\n   has changed\
    \ sufficiently to make RFCs largely unavailable to 'modern'\n   tools.\n   For\
    \ example, the RFC Editor may develop the practice of annually\n   reviewing the\
    \ tools needed to view the publication formats created by\n   the RFC Editor to\
    \ determine whether or not the current common and\n   popular reader technologies\
    \ (i.e., web browsers, PDF viewers,\n   e-readers) can view the existing publication\
    \ formats.  During that\n   review, the RFC Editor would work with the community\
    \ to determine if\n   the current publication formats meet the needs of the community\
    \ and\n   whether any should be retired or added to improve the availability of\n\
    \   information to the community at that time.\n"

  - "3.  Recommendations\n   Given the need to balance cost and complexity with retention\
    \ of\n   information for historic, legal, and informational purposes,\n   preservation\
    \ efforts should focus on the XML canonical format files,\n   the PDF/A-3 format\
    \ files, the xml2rfc tool and its documentation, and\n   at least two PDF reader\
    \ applications capable of extracting the\n   embedded XML.  Care should be taken\
    \ that the software being included\n   in this archive has a provision for free\
    \ copies for backup or\n   archival purposes.  All other formats and the overall\
    \ computing\n   environment should be stored as described in \"best effort\" data\n\
    \   retention (Section 2.4.1), which should in turn be described in the\n   appropriate\
    \ vendor contract for the RFC Publisher.\n   Particular preservation efforts should\
    \ be made by:\n   o  choosing a format designed for archiving RFCs (PDF/A-3 as\n\
    \      indicated by [RFC7995])\n   o  embedding the canonical XML format within\
    \ the PDF/A-3 file for\n      RFCs\n   o  retaining a copy of the plain-text or\
    \ XML file submitted for\n      approved I-Ds\n   o  retaining all major versions\
    \ of the tools and their associated\n      documentation used to acquire and ingest\
    \ an RFC\n   o  retaining the final XML file as well as the PDF/A-3 file with\
    \ the\n      embedded XML\n   o  retaining at least two software reader applications\
    \ to ensure the\n      PDF/A-3 and XML files can be viewed in the future\n   o\
    \  partnering with other digital archives around the world to mirror\n      copies\
    \ of the target data\n   In order to control costs and focus the archiving effort\
    \ on the\n   entire content of an RFC, including the metadata and other features\n\
    \   embedded within each RFC published in more than just plain text,\n   printing\
    \ each RFC to paper upon publication is no longer reasonable.\n   Proper data\
    \ storage and mirrored copies of RFCs provide more\n   efficient and effective\
    \ copies in case of catastrophic failure of the\n   existing archive of material.\n\
    \   Particular focus should be given to finding partners that specialize\n   in\
    \ digital preservation to ingest RFCs.  Ideally, they will ingest\n   all material\
    \ associated with an RFC, including all metadata, digital\n   signatures, and\
    \ the approved I-D that was submitted to the RFC\n   Editor.  The possibilities\
    \ and options should be discussed with each\n   archival partner; at minimum,\
    \ they must ingest copies of RFCs as they\n   are published, with the basic metadata\
    \ associated with each document.\n   Preservation efforts should be reviewed and\
    \ validated through a\n   biennial audit that will verify that the targeted content\
    \ and all its\n   associated metadata can be read with existing tools.  The full\n\
    \   process from acquisition to ingestion should be reviewed to ensure\n   that\
    \ best current practice is being followed from the perspective of\n   the digital\
    \ archive community.  Since the overall model for the\n   digital archive maintained\
    \ by the RFC Editor follows the OAIS\n   reference model, the associated audit\
    \ guidelines should also be\n   followed.  While the RFC Editor does not seek\
    \ to be recognized as\n   'OAIS-compliant' at this time, use of the ISO standard\
    \ \"Space data\n   and information transfer systems -- Audit and certification\
    \ of\n   trustworthy digital repositories\" [ISO16363] would provide a solid,\n\
    \   accepted method for structuring an audit for this digital archive.\n"
