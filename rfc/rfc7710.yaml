- title: Abstract
  contents:
  - "Abstract\n   In many environments offering short-term or temporary Internet access\n\
    \   (such as coffee shops), it is common to start new connections in a\n   captive-portal\
    \ mode.  This highly restricts what the customer can do\n   until the customer\
    \ has authenticated.\n   This document describes a DHCP option (and a Router Advertisement\n\
    \   (RA) extension) to inform clients that they are behind some sort of\n   captive-portal\
    \ device and that they will need to authenticate to get\n   Internet access. \
    \ It is not a full solution to address all of the\n   issues that clients may\
    \ have with captive portals; it is designed to\n   be used in larger solutions.\
    \  The method of authenticating to and\n   interacting with the captive portal\
    \ is out of scope for this\n   document.\n"

  - "1.  Introduction\n   In many environments, users need to connect to a captive-portal\n\
    \   device and agree to an Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) and/or provide\n   billing\
    \ information before they can access the Internet.  It is\n   anticipated that\
    \ the IETF will work on a more fully featured protocol\n   at some point, to ease\
    \ interaction with captive portals.  Regardless\n   of how that protocol operates,\
    \ it is expected that this document will\n   provide needed functionality because\
    \ the client will need to know\n   when it is behind a captive portal and how\
    \ to contact it.\n   In order to present users with the payment or AUP pages,\
    \ the captive-\n   portal device has to intercept the user's connections and redirect\n\
    \   the user to the captive portal, using methods that are very similar\n   to\
    \ man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks.  As increasing focus is placed\n   on security,\
    \ and end nodes adopt a more secure stance, these\n   interception techniques\
    \ will become less effective and/or more\n   intrusive.\n   This document describes\
    \ a DHCP ([RFC2131]) option (Captive-Portal)\n   and an IPv6 Router Advertisement\
    \ (RA) ([RFC4861]) extension that\n   inform clients that they are behind a captive-portal\
    \ device and how\n   to contact it.\n"

- title: 2.  The Captive-Portal Option
  contents:
  - "2.  The Captive-Portal Option\n   The Captive-Portal DHCP/RA option informs the\
    \ client that it is\n   behind a captive portal and provides the URI to access\
    \ an\n   authentication page.  This is primarily intended to improve the user\n\
    \   experience by getting them to the captive portal faster; for the\n   foreseeable\
    \ future, captive portals will still need to implement the\n   interception techniques\
    \ to serve legacy clients, and clients will\n   need to perform probing to detect\
    \ captive portals.\n   In order to support multiple \"classes\" of clients (e.g.,\
    \ IPv4 only,\n   IPv6 only with DHCPv6 ([RFC3315]), IPv6 only with RA), the captive\n\
    \   portal can provide the URI via multiple methods (IPv4 DHCP, IPv6\n   DHCP,\
    \ IPv6 RA).  The captive-portal operator should ensure that the\n   URIs handed\
    \ out are equivalent to reduce the chance of operational\n   problems.  The maximum\
    \ length of the URI that can be carried in IPv4\n   DHCP is 255 bytes, so URIs\
    \ longer than 255 bytes should not be used\n   in IPv6 DHCP or IPv6 RA.\n   In\
    \ order to avoid having to perform DNS interception, the URI SHOULD\n   contain\
    \ an address literal.  If the captive portal allows the client\n   to perform\
    \ DNS requests to resolve the name, it is then acceptable\n   for the URI to contain\
    \ a DNS name.  The URI parameter is not null\n   terminated.\n"

- title: 4.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "4.  Security Considerations\n   An attacker with the ability to inject DHCP messages\
    \ could include\n   this option and so force users to contact an address of his\
    \ choosing.\n   As an attacker with this capability could simply list himself\
    \ as the\n   default gateway (and so intercept all the victim's traffic), this\n\
    \   does not provide the attacker with significantly more capabilities,\n   but\
    \ because this document removes the need for interception, the\n   attacker may\
    \ have an easier time performing the attack.  As the\n   operating systems and\
    \ application that make use of this information\n   know that they are connecting\
    \ to a captive-portal device (as opposed\n   to intercepted connections), they\
    \ can render the page in a sandboxed\n   environment and take other precautions,\
    \ such as clearly labeling the\n   page as untrusted.  The means of sandboxing\
    \ and how the user\n   interface presents this information are not covered in\
    \ this document\n   -- by their nature, those are implementation specific and\
    \ best left\n   to the application and user-interface designers.\n   Devices and\
    \ systems that automatically connect to an open network\n   could potentially\
    \ be tracked using the techniques described in this\n   document (forcing the\
    \ user to continually authenticate, or exposing\n   their browser fingerprint).\
    \  However, similar tracking can already be\n   performed with the standard captive-portal\
    \ mechanisms, so this\n   technique does not give the attackers more capabilities.\n\
    \   Captive portals are increasingly hijacking TLS connections to force\n   browsers\
    \ to talk to the portal.  Providing the portal's URI via a\n   DHCP or RA option\
    \ is a cleaner technique and reduces user\n   expectations of being hijacked;\
    \ this may improve security by making\n   users more reluctant to accept TLS hijacking,\
    \ which can be performed\n   from beyond the network associated with the captive\
    \ portal.\n   By simplifying the interaction with the captive-portal systems and\n\
    \   doing away with the need for interception, we think that users will\n   be\
    \ less likely to disable useful security safeguards like DNSSEC\n   validation,\
    \ VPNs, etc.  In addition, because the system knows that it\n   is behind a captive\
    \ portal, it can know not to send cookies,\n   credentials, etc.  By handing out\
    \ a URI that is protected with TLS,\n   the captive-portal operator can attempt\
    \ to reassure the user that the\n   captive portal is not malicious.\n"
