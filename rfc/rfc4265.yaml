    \ the documents that describe the current\n   Internet-Standard Management Framework,\
    \ please refer to section 7 of\n   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].\n   Managed objects are\
    \ accessed via a virtual information store, termed\n   the Management Information\
    \ Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally\n   accessed through the Simple Network\
    \ Management Protocol (SNMP).\n   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms\
    \ defined in the\n   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies\
    \ a MIB\n   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,\n\
    \   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580\n   [RFC2580].\n"

  - "3.1.  Description\n   The VPN-TC-STD-MIB defines a Textual Convention for the\
    \ Global VPN\n   Identifier, or VPN-ID, as specified in [RFC2685].  The purpose\
    \ of a\n   VPN-ID is to uniquely identify a VPN.  It MUST be 7 octets in length,\n\
    \   and SHOULD be comprised of a 3 octet Organizationally Unique\n   Identifier\
    \ (OUI) that uniquely identifies the VPN Authority, followed\n   by a 4 octet\
    \ value assigned by the VPN Authority that uniquely\n   identifies the VPN within\
    \ the context of the OUI.\n"

    \ can only be written in the MIB\n   modules that define management objects. \
