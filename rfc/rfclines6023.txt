This document describes an extension to the Internet Key Exchange version 2 (IKEv2) protocol that allows an IKEv2 Security Association (SA) to be created and authenticated without generating a Child SA.
Introduction IKEv2, as specified in [RFC5996], requires that the IKE AUTH exchange try to create a Child SA along with the IKEv2 SA.
This requirement is sometimes inconvenient or superfluous, as some implementations need to use IKEv2 for authentication only, while others would like to set up the IKEv2 SA before there is any actual traffic to protect.
The extension described in this document allows the creation of an IKEv2 SA without also attempting to create a Child SA.
The terms IKEv2, IKEv2 SA, and Child SA and the various IKEv2 exchanges are defined in [RFC5996]
An IKEv2 SA without any Child SA is not a fruitless endeavor.
Even without Child SAs, an IKEv2 SA allows:  Checking the liveness status of the peer via liveness checks.
Quickly setting up Child SAs without public key operations and without user interaction.
Detection of NAT boxes between two hosts on the Internet.
Conventions Used in This Document
The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "
SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].
Several scenarios motivated this proposal:  Interactive remote access
VPN: the user tells the client to "connect", which may involve interactive authentication.
There is still no traffic, but some may come later.
Since there is no traffic, it is impossible for the gateway to know what selectors to use (how to narrow down the client's proposal).
Location aware security, as in [SecureBeacon].
The user is roaming between trusted and untrusted networks.
While in an untrusted network, all traffic should be encrypted, but on the trusted network, only the IKEv2 SA needs to be maintained.
An IKEv2 SA may be needed between peers even when there is not IPsec traffic.
Such IKEv2 peers use liveness checks, and report to the administrator the status of the "VPN links".
IKEv2 may be used on some physically secure links, where authentication is necessary but traffic protection is not.
An example of this is the Passive Optical Network (PON) links as described in [3GPP.33.820].
Childless IKEv2 can be used for [RFC5106] where we use IKEv2 as a method for user authentication.
A node receiving IPsec traffic with an unrecognized Security Parameter Index (SPI) should send an INVALID SPI notification.
If this traffic comes from a peer, which it recognizes based on its IP address, then this node may set up an IKEv2 SA so as to be able to send the notification in a protected INFORMATIONAL exchange.
A future extension may have IKEv2 SAs used for generating keying material for applications, without ever requiring Child SAs.
This is similar to what [RFC5705] is doing in Transport Layer Security (TLS).
In some of these cases, it may be possible to create a dummy Child SA and then remove it, but this creates undesirable side effects and race conditions.
Moreover, the IKEv2 peer might see the deletion of the Child SA as a reason to delete the IKEv2 SA.
The decision of whether or not to support an IKE AUTH exchange without the piggy backed Child SA negotiation is ultimately up to the responder.
A supporting responder MUST include the Notify payload, described in Section 4, within the IKE SA INIT response.
A supporting initiator MAY send the modified IKE AUTH request, described in Section 5, if the notification was included in the IKE SA INIT response.
The initiator MUST NOT send the modified IKE AUTH request if the notification was not present.
A supporting responder that has advertised support by including the notification in the IKE SA INIT response MUST process a modified IKE AUTH request, and MUST reply with a modified IKE AUTH response.
Such a responder MUST NOT reply with a modified IKE AUTH response if the initiator did not send a modified IKE AUTH request.
A supporting responder that has been configured not to support this extension to the protocol MUST behave as the same as if it didn't support this extension.
It MUST NOT advertise the capability with a notification, and it SHOULD reply with an INVALID SYNTAX Notify payload if the client sends an IKE AUTH request that is modified as described in Section 5.
Childless Notify Message Type !
Protocol ID (1 octet) MUST be 1, as this message is related to an IKEv2 SA.
SPI Size (1 octet) MUST be zero, in conformance with section 3.10 of [RFC5996].
Childless Notify Message Type (2 octets) MUST be 16418, the value assigned for CHILDLESS IKEV2 SUPPORTED.
Modified IKE AUTH Exchange For brevity, only the Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) version of an AUTH exchange will be presented here.
The non EAP version is very similar.
The figures below are based on Appendix C.3 of [RFC5996].
, [V ][N ] Note what is missing:
IPCOMP SUPPORTED, USE TRANSPORT MODE,
ESP TFC PADDING NOT SUPPORTED, and NON FIRST FRAGMENTS ALSO.
Any notification, extension payload or VendorID that has to do with Child SA negotiation.
This protocol variation inherits all the security properties of regular IKEv2 as described in [RFC5996].
The new notification carried in the initial exchange advertises the capability, and cannot be forged or added by an adversary without being detected, because the response to the initial exchange is authenticated with the AUTH payload of the IKE AUTH exchange.
Furthermore, both peers have to be configured to use this variation of the exchange in order for the responder to accept a childless proposal from the initiator.
IANA Considerations IANA has assigned a notify message type from the "IKEv2 Notify Message Types" registry with the name "CHILDLESS IKEV2 SUPPORTED" and the value "16418".
