  - "                            TELNET Protocol\n   This is a request for comment\
    \ and is being distributed in advance of\n   the Atlantic City meetings for review\
    \ and comment prior to or during\n   discussions on TELNET in preparation for\
    \ issuing an official\n   document.\n   It is also being distributed so that selected\
    \ installations planning\n   to implement early versions of TELNET will have a\
    \ common basis for\n   such implementation.\n   The proposed document is the result\
    \ of the work of the committee.  It\n   represents a TELNET protocol felt to be\
    \ adequate for initial\n   implementation.  A few recent suggestions by committee\
    \ members and\n   others have been incorporated where even though not thoroughly\n\
    \   cleared with all members, the chairman felt that they clarified the\n   protocol\
    \ or would tend to simplify implementation but not\n   substantially change the\
    \ agreed-upon approach.\n   Readers are referenced to the following previous releases\
    \ of\n   information:\n   1. Conventions for Using an IBM 2741 Terminal or a User\
    \ Console for\n      Access to Network Server HOSTS\n         Joel Winett, RFC\
    \ 110 (NIC #5809)\n   2. Level III Server Protocol for the Lincoln Laboratory\
    \ 360/67 HOST\n         Joel Winett, RFC 109 (NIC #5808)\n   3. First Cut at a\

    \                   MIT-LL\n   TELNET is a third-level protocol, the function\
    \ of which is to make a\n   terminal (or process) at a using site appear to the\
    \ system or a\n   process at a serving site as logically equivalent to a terminal\n\
    \   \"directly\" connected to the serving site.  In performing this\n   function,\
    \ the protocol attempts to minimize the amount of information\n   each HOST must\
    \ keep about the characteristics of other HOSTS.\n   Definitions\n   Protocol\
    \ Levels (see Figure 1)\n      Level 1\n         HOST-IMP protocol specified by\
    \ BBN in NIC 5735, Specifications\n         for the Interconnection of a HOST,\
    \ and an IMP (BBN Report 1822)\n      Level 2\n         HOST-HOST protocol performed\
    \ by NCPs as described in Document\n         Number 1 (NIC 5413) and subsequent\
    \ amendments, see RFC 107 (NIC\n         #5806)\n            One view of the NCP's\
    \ function is that it takes information\n            from the net and routes it\
    \ to receiving processes via\n            mechanisms internal to each HOST; conversely,\
    \ processes use\n            the NCP, via internal system calls, to have information\n\
    \            routed to other processes in the net (via the other\n           \
    \ processes' NCPs).\n      Level 3 (see Figure 2)\n         Level 3 is, by definition,\
    \ the place to which and from which\n         the NCP communicates internally\
    \ in its own host.\n            This level may be equivalent to the user process\
    \ level in\n            some systems, but this may not be the case in all systems.\n\
    \            In using sites, the TELNET process operates at this level.\n    \
    \        In serving sites, the TELNET server operates at this level.\n   Initial\
    \ Connection Protocol (ICP)\n      An agreed-upon sequence of level 3 exchanges\
    \ between two processes\n      which is, in general, used to synchronize the dialogue\
    \ between the\n      processes, e.g., RFC 80 (NIC #5608) #1.\n   Serving Site\n\
    \      The HOST into which the TELNET process is directing the user's\n      keyboard\
    \ input and from which the TELNET process is receiving\n      control information\
    \ and data effecting the user's terminal.  At\n      the serving site, a TELNET\
    \ server is executing.\n   Using Site\n      The HOST in which the TELNET process\
    \ is executing.\n   Sending Site\n      The HOST transmitting data, could be either\
    \ using site or serving\n      site.\n   Receiving Site\n      Converse of sending\
    \ site.\n   User\n      The person or process \"driving\" the TELNET process.\n\
    \   In providing services the TELNET protocol will use established\n   network\
    \ conventions, specifically the Network Control Program, and\n   Initial Connection\
    \ Protocol referenced in the above definitions.\n   The TELNET protocol provides\
    \ for a Network Virtual Terminal (NVT)\n   through which users may transmit and\
    \ receive data over connections\n   between the using site and the serving site.\n\
    \   The code of the NVT will be full ASCII.  The seven-bit code will be\n   transmitted\
    \ in eight-bit bytes, the high order bit set to zero.\n   It will be the responsibility\
    \ of the using site to provide its users\n   with a means of producing all 128\
    \ ASCII codes, as well as a selected\n   set of special TELNET control signals\
    \ (see Figure 3).\n   The ASCII character ESC will be employed by the user as\
    \ an escape\n   signal indicating that the next character(s) has special meaning.\n\
    \   The meaning assigned to escape code will be serving site defined and\n   therefore\
    \ may not be consistant across the network.\n   It will be the responsibility\
    \ of the serving site to specify for\n   users how the NVT code will be used to\
    \ represent the codes normally\n   generated by a local terminal.  The serving\
    \ sites specification of\n   this representation is expected, where reasonable,\
    \ to map on a one-\n   for-one basis for ASCII graphics and controls that are\
    \ provided\n   through local terminals.  The serving site will also specify how\
    \ the\n   escape conventions will be interpreted by the system.\n   The end of\
    \ a line will be represented in the NVT as carriage return\n   followed by line\
    \ feed.\n   The protocol assumes that at initially the serving site will not\n\
    \   provide any echo to the using site.\n   Each TELNET control signal for which\
    \ code must be sent over the\n   connection will be represented in the NVT by\
    \ an eight-bit code, with\n   the high order bit set to one.  Following are the\
    \ special codes\n   established to date. (U) indicates that in most implementations\
    \ the\n   user would be expected to have the ability to signal the TELNET\n  \
    \ process from his terminal to initiate the code.\n   Code X'A0'\n      Source:\
    \  Both Sites (U)\n      Meaning: A DATA TYPE[1] signal indicating that code will\
    \ be\n               transmitted by NVT, i.e., using the seven-bit ASCII\n   \
    \            conventions.\n   Code X'80'\n      Source:  Using Site (U)\n    \
    \  Meaning: Order using site NCP to send an INS and insert X'80' in\n        \
    \       data stream.\n   Code X'81'\n      Source:  Using Site (U)\n      Meaning:\
    \ Break or Attention\n   Code X'82'\n      Source:  Serving System\n      Meaning:\
    \ Reverse Break\n   Code X'83'\n      Source:  Both Sites\n      Meaning: I Echo\n\
    \   Code X'84'\n      Source:  Both Sites\n      Meaning: You Echo\n   Code X'85'\n\
    \      Reserved\n   Code X'86'\n      Reserved\n   Code X'87'\n      Source: \
    \ Both Sites\n      Meaning: This site has not implemented the following control\
    \ code.\n   Code X'88'\n      Source:  Both Sites\n      Meaning: [2]Return to\
    \ control mode, i.e. next byte will be a\n               control signal, possible\
    \ a new DATA TYPE.\n   Some special TELNET control signals are required to permit\
    \ the user\n   on some systems to send control information to the using site TELNET\n\
    \   process.  These do not require a corresponding control code for\n   transmission.\
    \  The local TELNET control signals are:\n      1. Transmit all data to this point.\n\
    \      2. Suppress transmission of end of line, send all other data.\n   Data\
    \ is to be forwarded to the NCP for transmission as convenient,\n   but at least\
    \ at the end of line, end of line suppression, and\n   transmit signals.  If the\
    \ normal line length of the sending site is\n   greater than the allocation given\
    \ by the receiving site, the sending\n   sites TELNET process or TELNET server\
    \ will be responsible for\n   breaking the line into convenient lengths and turning\
    \ them over to\n   the NCP for transmission.\n   This document will be revised\
    \ as necessary to provide conventions for\n   data types, in addition to the NVT\
    \ ASCII type.\n"

  - "Footnotes:\n   [1] A one-byte DATA TYPE signal is sent as the first byte of data\n\
    \   over a connection.  A default is employed if the first byte over a\n   connection\
    \ has the high order bit set to zero, and it is assumed that\n   the seven-bit\
    \ ASCII NVT convention will be employed.  After initial\n   connection, the DATA\
    \ TYPE may be changed (see code X'88').  Most\n   implementations and applications\
    \ may expect the DATA TYPES to be\n   symmetrical at any point in time,(i.e. both\
    \ using a serving site\n   using the same DATA TYPE.).\n   [2] A site receiving\
    \ a DATA TYPE signal is to respond with a double\n   X'88' if the new DATA TYPE\
    \ is acceptable.\n"
