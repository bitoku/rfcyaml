  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   In order to use the Token Binding protocol [RFC8471], the\
    \ client and\n   server need to agree on the Token Binding protocol version and\
    \ the\n   parameters (signature algorithm and length) of the Token Binding key.\n\
    \   This document specifies a new TLS [RFC5246] extension to accomplish\n   this\
    \ negotiation without introducing additional network round trips\n   in TLS 1.2\
    \ and earlier versions.  [TOKENBIND-TLS13] addresses Token\n   Binding in TLS\
    \ 1.3.  The negotiation of the Token Binding protocol\n   and key parameters in\
    \ combination with TLS 1.3 and later versions is\n   beyond the scope of this\
    \ document.  (Note: This document deals with\n   TLS 1.2 and therefore refers\
    \ to RFC 5246 (which has been obsoleted by\n   RFC 8446).  [TOKENBIND-TLS13] addresses\
    \ Token Binding in TLS 1.3).\n"

    \ protocol version and key parameters.\n   enum {\n       token_binding(24), (65535)\n\

    \ one with the highest\n   TB_ProtocolVersion.major and TB_ProtocolVersion.minor)\
    \ in\n   TokenBindingParameters.token_binding_version.  For example, if the\n\
    \   client supports versions {1, 0} and {0, 13} of the Token Binding\n   protocol,\
    \ it SHOULD indicate version {1, 0}. Please note that the\n   server MAY select\
    \ any lower protocol version; see Section 3\n   (\"Token Binding Negotiation ServerHello\
    \ Extension\") for more details.\n   If the client does not support the Token\
    \ Binding protocol version\n   selected by the server, then the connection proceeds\
    \ without Token\n   Binding.  [RFC8471] describes version {1, 0} of the protocol.\n\
    \   Please note that the representation of the Token Binding protocol\n   version\
    \ using two octets (\"major\" and \"minor\") is for human\n   convenience only\
    \ and carries no protocol significance.\n   \"key_parameters_list\" contains the\
    \ list of identifiers of the Token\n   Binding key parameters supported by the\
    \ client, in descending order\n   of preference.  [RFC8471] establishes an IANA\
    \ registry for Token\n   Binding key parameters identifiers.\n"
- title: 3.  Token Binding Negotiation ServerHello Extension
  contents:
  - "3.  Token Binding Negotiation ServerHello Extension\n   The server uses the \"\
    token_binding\" TLS extension to indicate support\n   for the Token Binding protocol\
    \ and to select the protocol version and\n   key parameters.\n   The server that\
    \ supports Token Binding and receives a ClientHello\n   message containing the\
    \ \"token_binding\" extension will include the\n   \"token_binding\" extension\
    \ in the ServerHello if all of the following\n   conditions are satisfied:\n \
    \  1.  The server supports the Token Binding protocol version offered by\n   \
    \    the client, or a lower version.\n   2.  The server finds acceptable Token\
    \ Binding key parameters in the\n       client's list.\n   3.  The server is also\
    \ negotiating the extended master secret\n       [RFC7627] and renegotiation indication\
    \ [RFC5746] TLS extensions.\n       This requirement applies when TLS 1.2 or an\
    \ older TLS version is\n       used (see Section 6 (\"Security Considerations\"\
    ) for more\n       details).\n   The server will ignore any key parameters that\
    \ it does not recognize.\n   The \"extension_data\" field of the \"token_binding\"\
    \ extension is\n   structured the same as described above for the client\n   \"\
    extension_data\".\n   \"token_binding_version\" contains the lower of:\n   o \
    \ the Token Binding protocol version offered by the client in the\n      \"token_binding\"\
    \ extension, and\n   o  the highest Token Binding protocol version supported by\
    \ the\n      server.\n   \"key_parameters_list\" contains exactly one Token Binding\
    \ key\n   parameters identifier selected by the server from the client's list.\n"
- title: 4.  Negotiating Token Binding Protocol Version and Key Parameters
  contents:
  - "4.  Negotiating Token Binding Protocol Version and Key Parameters\n   It is expected\
    \ that a server will have a list of Token Binding key\n   parameters identifiers\
    \ that it supports, in preference order.  The\n   server MUST only select an identifier\
    \ that the client offered.  The\n   server SHOULD select the most highly preferred\
    \ key parameters\n   identifier it supports, which is also advertised by the client.\
    \  In\n   the event that the server supports none of the key parameters that\n\
    \   the client advertises, then the server MUST NOT include the\n   \"token_binding\"\
    \ extension in the ServerHello.\n   The client receiving the \"token_binding\"\
    \ extension MUST terminate the\n   handshake with a fatal \"unsupported_extension\"\
    \ alert if any of the\n   following conditions are true:\n   1.  The client did\
    \ not include the \"token_binding\" extension in the\n       ClientHello.\n  \
    \ 2.  \"token_binding_version\" is higher than the Token Binding protocol\n  \
    \     version advertised by the client.\n   3.  \"key_parameters_list\" includes\
    \ more than one Token Binding key\n       parameters identifier.\n   4.  \"key_parameters_list\"\
    \ includes an identifier that was not\n       advertised by the client.\n   5.\
    \  TLS 1.2 or an older TLS version is used, but the extended master\n       secret\
    \ [RFC7627] and TLS renegotiation indication [RFC5746]\n       extensions are\
    \ not negotiated (see Section 6\n       (\"Security Considerations\") for more\
    \ details).\n   If the \"token_binding\" extension is included in the ServerHello\
    \ and\n   the client supports the Token Binding protocol version selected by\n\
    \   the server, it means that the version and key parameters have been\n   negotiated\
    \ between the client and the server and SHALL be definitive\n   for the TLS connection.\
    \  TLS 1.2 and earlier versions support\n   renegotiation, which allows the client\
    \ and server to renegotiate the\n   Token Binding protocol version and key parameters\
    \ on the same\n   connection.  The client MUST use the negotiated key parameters\
    \ in the\n   \"provided_token_binding\" as described in [RFC8471].\n   If the\
    \ client does not support the Token Binding protocol version\n   selected by the\
    \ server, then the connection proceeds without Token\n   Binding.  There is no\
    \ requirement for the client to support any Token\n   Binding versions other than\
    \ the one advertised in the client's\n   \"token_binding\" extension.\n   Client\
    \ and server applications can choose to handle failure to\n   negotiate Token\
    \ Binding in a variety of ways: continue using the\n   connection as usual, shorten\
    \ the lifetime of tokens issued during\n   this connection, require stronger authentication,\
    \ terminate the\n   connection, etc.\n   The Token Binding protocol version and\
    \ key parameters are negotiated\n   for each TLS connection, which means that\
    \ the client and server\n   include their \"token_binding\" extensions in both\
    \ the full TLS\n   handshake that establishes a new TLS session and the subsequent\n\
    \   abbreviated TLS handshakes that resume the TLS session.\n"

  contents:
  - "6.1.  Downgrade Attacks\n   The Token Binding protocol version and key parameters\
    \ are negotiated\n   via the \"token_binding\" extension within the TLS handshake.\
    \  TLS\n   detects handshake message modification by active attackers;\n   therefore,\
    \ it is not possible for an attacker to remove or modify the\n   \"token_binding\"\
    \ extension without breaking the TLS handshake.  The\n   signature algorithm and\
    \ key length used in the Token Binding of type\n   \"provided_token_binding\"\
    \ MUST match the parameters negotiated via the\n   \"token_binding\" extension.\n"
- title: 6.2.  Triple Handshake Vulnerability in TLS 1.2 and Older TLS Versions
  contents:
  - "6.2.  Triple Handshake Vulnerability in TLS 1.2 and Older TLS Versions\n   The\
    \ Token Binding protocol relies on the TLS exporters [RFC5705] to\n   associate\
    \ a TLS connection with a Token Binding.  The triple\n   handshake attack [TRIPLE-HS]\
    \ is a known vulnerability in TLS 1.2 and\n   older TLS versions; it allows an\
    \ attacker to synchronize keying\n   material between TLS connections.  The attacker\
    \ can then successfully\n   replay bound tokens.  For this reason, the Token Binding\
    \ protocol\n   MUST NOT be negotiated with these TLS versions, unless the extended\n\
    \   master secret [RFC7627] and renegotiation indication [RFC5746] TLS\n   extensions\
    \ have also been negotiated.\n"
