Abstract This memo defines the "ipp" URL (Uniform Resource Locator) scheme.
Encoding and Transport (RFC 2910), by expanding and clarifying Section 5, "IPP URL Scheme", of RFC 2910.
An "ipp" URL is used to specify the network location of a print service that supports the IPP Protocol (RFC 2910), or of a network resource (for example, a print job) managed by such a print service.
This memo conforms to all of the requirements in Registration Procedures for URL Scheme Names [RFC2717].
This memo also follows all of the recommendations in Guidelines for new URL Schemes [RFC2718].
See section 1, "Introduction", of [RFC2911] and section 1, "Introduction", of [RFC3196] for overview information about IPP.
See section 10, "Description of the Base IPP Documents", of [RFC3196] for a full description of the IPP document set.
Encoding and Transport (RFC 2910), by expanding and clarifying Section 5, "IPP URL Scheme", of RFC 2910, but does not define any new parameters or other new extensions to the syntax of IPP URLs.
The IPP URL scheme defined in this document is based on the ABNF for the HTTP URL scheme defined in HTTP [RFC2616], which in turn is derived from the URI Generic Syntax [RFC2396] and further updated for IPv6 by [RFC2732].
An IPP URL is transformed into an HTTP URL according to the rules specified in section 5 of IPP Protocol [RFC2910].
This document defines IPP URL scheme applicability, associated port (631), associated MIME type ("application/ipp"), character encoding, and syntax.
This document is laid out as follows:  Section 2 defines the terminology used throughout the document.
Section 3 supplies references to the IPP Printer and IPP Job object model defined in IPP Model [RFC2911].
Section 4 specifies the IPP URL scheme.
Section 5 specifies the conformance requirements for IPP Clients and IPP Printers that claim conformance to this document.
Sections 6, 7, and 8 specify IANA, internationalization, and security considerations.
Sections 9, 10, 11, 12, and 13 specify normative references, informative references, acknowledgements, authors' addresses, and full IETF copyright statement.
Section 14 (Appendix A) is a completed registration template for the IPP URL Scheme (see section 6.0 of [RFC2717]).
This specification document uses the terminology defined in this section.
The uppercase terms "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "
SHALL NOT" "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].
These terms are used to specify conformance requirements for all implementations (both print clients and print services) of this specification.
Model Terminology See section 12.2,
"Model Terminology", in IPP Model [RFC2911].
IPP Model for Printers and Jobs See section 2, "IPP Objects", section 2.1, "Printer Object", and section 2.2, "Job Object", in [RFC2911] for a full description of the IPP object model and terminology.
In this document, "IPP Client" means the software (on some hardware platform) that submits, monitors,
and/or manages print jobs via the IPP Protocol [RFC2910] to a print spooler, print gateway, or physical printing device.
In this document, "IPP Printer object" means the software (on some hardware platform) that receives print jobs and/or printer/job operations via the IPP Protocol [RFC2910] from an "IPP Client".
In this document, "IPP Printer" is a synonym for "IPP Printer object".
In this document, "IPP Job object" means the set of attributes and documents for one print job instantiated on an "IPP Printer".
In this document, "IPP Job" is a synonym for "IPP Job object".
In this document, "IPP URL" means a URL with the "ipp" scheme.
In this document, "IPP URL" is a synonym for "ipp URL" (in section 4, "IPP URL Scheme", of this document) and "ipp URL" (in section 5, "IPP URL Scheme", of [RFC2910]).
The "ipp" URL scheme MUST only be used to specify absolute URLs (relative IPP URLs are not allowed) for IPP print services and their associated network resources.
The "ipp" URL scheme MUST only be used to specify the use of the abstract protocol defined in IPP Model [RFC2911] over an HTTP [RFC2616] transport, as defined in IPP Protocol [RFC2910].
Any other transport binding for the abstract protocol defined in IPP Model [RFC2911] would require a different URL scheme.
The "ipp" URL scheme allows an IPP client to choose an appropriate IPP print service (for example, from a directory).
The IPP client can establish an HTTP connection to the specified IPP print service.
The IPP client can send IPP protocol requests (for example, a "Print Job" request) and receive IPP protocol responses over that HTTP connection.
IPP URL Scheme Associated Port
All IPP URLs which do NOT explicitly specify a port MUST be resolved to IANA assigned well known port 631, as registered in [IANA PORTREG].
See:  IANA Port Numbers Registry [IANA PORTREG].
IPP URL Scheme Associated MIME Type All IPP URLs MUST be used to specify network print services which support the "application/ipp" MIME media type as registered in [IANA MIMEREG] for IPP protocol requests and responses.
See:  IANA MIME Media Types Registry [IANA MIMEREG].
IPP URL Scheme Character Encoding IPP URLs MUST use [RFC2396] encoding, as do their equivalent HTTP URLs.
The abstract protocol defined in IPP Model [RFC2911] places a limit of 1023 octets (NOT characters) on the length of a URI (see section 4.1.5, "uri", in [RFC2911]).
Note:  IPP Printers ought to be cautious about depending on URI lengths above 255 bytes, because some older client implementations might not properly support these lengths.
IPP URLs MUST be represented in absolute form.
Absolute URLs MUST always begin with a scheme name followed by a colon.
For definitive information on URL syntax and semantics, see "Uniform Resource Identifiers (URI):
Generic Syntax and Semantics" [RFC2396].
This specification adopts the definitions of "host", "port", "abs path", and "query" from [RFC2396], as updated for IPv6 by [RFC2732].
The IPP URL scheme syntax in ABNF is as follows:
If the port is empty or not given, port 631 is assumed.
The semantics are that the identified resource (see section 5.1.2 of [RFC2616]) is located at the IPP print service listening for HTTP connections on that port of that host, and the Request URI for the identified resource is 'abs path'.
Literal IPv4 or IPv6 addresses SHOULD NOT be used in IPP URLs.
The following are examples of well formed IPP URLs for IPP Printers (for example, to be used as protocol elements in 'printer uri' operation attributes of 'Print Job' request messages):
ipp://example.com ipp://example.com/printer ipp://example.com/printer/tiger ipp://example.com/printer/fox ipp://example.com/printer/tiger/bob ipp://example.com/printer/tiger/ira Each of the above URLs are well formed URLs for IPP Printers and each would reference a logically different IPP Printer, even though some of those IPP Printers might share the same host system.
The 'bob' or 'ira' last path components might represent two different physical printer devices, while 'tiger' might represent some grouping of IPP Printers (for example, a load balancing spooler).
Or the 'bob' and 'ira'
last path components might represent separate human recipients on the same physical printer device (for example, a physical printer supporting two job queues).
In either case, both 'bob' and 'ira' would behave as different and independent IPP Printers.
The following are examples of well formed IPP URLs for IPP Printers with (optional) ports and paths: ipp://example.com ipp://example.com/~smith/printer ipp://example.com:631/~smith/printer
The first and second IPP URLs above MUST be resolved to port 631 (IANA assigned well known port for IPP).
The second and third IPP URLs above are equivalent (see section 4.7 below).
The following are examples of well formed IPP URLs for IPP Jobs (for example, to be used as protocol elements in 'job uri' attributes of 'Print Job' response messages):
ipp://example.com/printer/tiger/job123 IPP Job URLs are valid and meaningful only until Job completion and possibly an implementation defined optional period of persistence after Job completion (see IPP Model [RFC2911]).
Ambiguously, section 4.3.1 'job uri' of IPP Model [RFC2911] states that: "the precise format of a Job URI is implementation dependent."
Thus, the relationship between the value of the "printer uri" operation attribute used in a 'Print Job' request and the value of the "job uri" attribute returned in the corresponding 'Print Job' response is implementation dependent.
Also, section 4.3.3 'job  printer uri' of IPP Model [RFC2911
] states that the 'job printer uri' attribute of a Job object: "permits a client to identify the Printer object that created this Job
object when only the Job object's URI is available to the client."
However, the above statement is false, because the transform from an IPP Job URL to the corresponding IPP Printer URL is unspecified in either IPP Model [RFC2911] or IPP Protocol [RFC2910].
IPP Printers that conform to this specification SHOULD only generate IPP Job URLs (for example, in the "job uri" attribute in a 'Print  Job' response) by appending exactly one path component to the corresponding IPP Printer URL (for interoperability).
When comparing two IPP URLs to decide if they match or not, an IPP Client MUST use the same rules as those defined for HTTP URI comparisons in [RFC2616], with the sole following exception:  A port that is empty or not given MUST be treated as equivalent to the well known port for that IPP URL (port 631); See:  Section 3.2.3, "URI Comparison", in [RFC2616].
IPP Client Conformance Requirements IPP Clients that conform to this specification: a) MUST only send IPP protocol connections to the port specified in each given IPP URL (if present) or otherwise to IANA assigned well known port 631; b) MUST only send IPP URLs used as protocol elements in outgoing IPP protocol request messages (for example, in the "printer uri" operation attribute in a 'Print Job' request) that conform to the ABNF specified in section 4.5, "IPP URL Scheme Syntax, of this document; c) MUST only convert IPP URLs to their corresponding HTTP URL forms according to the rules in section 5, "IPP URL Scheme", in [RFC2910].
IPP Printer Conformance Requirements IPP Printers that conform to this specification
: a) MUST listen for incoming IPP protocol connections on IANA assigned well known port 631,
unless explicitly configured by system administrators or site policies; b) SHOULD NOT listen for incoming IPP protocol connections on any other port, unless explicitly configured by system administrators or site policies; c) SHOULD only accept IPP URLs used as protocol elements in incoming IPP protocol request messages (for example, in the "printer uri" operation attribute in a 'Print Job' request) that conform to the ABNF specified in section 4.5,
"IPP URL Scheme Syntax", of this document; d) SHOULD only send IPP URLs used as protocol elements in outgoing IPP protocol response messages (for example, in the "job uri" attribute in a 'Print Job' response) that conform to the ABNF specified in section 4.5, "IPP URL Scheme Syntax", of this document;
e) SHOULD only generate IPP Job URLs (for example, in the "job uri" attribute in a 'Print Job' response) by appending exactly one path component to the corresponding IPP Printer URL (for interoperability); f) SHOULD NOT use literal IPv6 or IPv4 addresses in configured or locally generated IPP URLs.
This IPP URL Scheme specification does not introduce any additional IANA considerations, beyond those described in [RFC2910] and [RFC2911].
See:  Section 6, "IANA Considerations" in [RFC2910]
See:  Section 6, "IANA Considerations" in [RFC2911].
This IPP URL Scheme specification does not introduce any additional internationalization considerations, beyond those described in [RFC2910] and [RFC2911].
See:  Section 7, "Internationalization Considerations", in [RFC2910].
See:  Section 7, "Internationalization Considerations", in [RFC2911].
This IPP URL Scheme specification does not introduce any additional security considerations, beyond those described in [RFC2910] and [RFC2911], except the following: a)
An IPP URL might be faked to point to a rogue IPP print service, thus collecting confidential document contents from IPP clients.
Server authentication mechanisms and security mechanisms specified in the IPP Protocol [RFC2910] are sufficient to address this threat.
An IPP URL might be used to access an IPP print service by an unauthorized IPP client.
Client authentication mechanisms and security mechanisms specified in the IPP Protocol [RFC2910] are sufficient to address this threat.
An IPP URL might be used to access an IPP print service at a print protocol application layer gateway (for example, an IPP to LPD gateway [RFC2569]) causing silent compromise of IPP security mechanisms.
There is no practical defense against this threat by a client system.
System administrators should avoid such compromising configurations.
An IPP URL does not have parameters to specify the required client authentication mechanism (for example, 'certificate' as defined in section 4.4.2, "uri authentication supported", of IPP Model [RFC2911]) and required security mechanism (for example, 'tls' as defined in section 4.4.3, "uri security supported", of IPP Model [RFC2911]).
Service discovery or directory protocols might be used to discover the required client authentication and security mechanisms associated with given IPP URLs.
During the development of this document, consideration was given to the addition of standard IPP URL parameters for the client authentication and security mechanisms.
However, based on a strong IETF IPP Working Group consensus, no parameters were added to the "ipp" URL scheme as originally defined in IPP Protocol [RFC2910] in September 2000, for reasons of backwards compatibility with the many currently shipping implementations of IPP/1.1.

Appendix A Registration of "ipp" URL Scheme Note:
The following registration obsoletes section 5, "IPP URL Scheme", of IPP Protocol [RFC2911].
Character Encoding Considerations: IPP URLs MUST use [RFC2396] encoding, as do their equivalent HTTP URLs.
The intended usage of the "ipp" URL scheme is COMMON.
An "ipp" URL is used to specify the network location of a print service that supports the IPP Protocol [RFC2910], or of a network resource (for example, a print job) managed by such a print service.
An IPP client can choose to establish an HTTP connection to the specified print service for transmission of IPP protocol requests (for example, IPP print job submission requests).
