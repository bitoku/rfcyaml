  - "1.  Introduction\n   The GMPLS control plane consists of several building blocks\
    \ as\n   described in [RFC3945].  The building blocks include signaling,\n   routing,\
    \ and link management for establishing LSPs.  For scalability\n   purposes, multiple\
    \ physical resources can be combined to form a\n   single TE link for the purposes\
    \ of path computation and GMPLS control\n   plane signaling.\n   As manual provisioning\
    \ and management of these links are impractical\n   in large networks, LMP was\
    \ specified to manage TE links.  Two\n   mandatory management capabilities of\
    \ LMP are control channel\n   management and TE link property correlation.  Additional\
    \ optional\n   capabilities include verifying physical connectivity and fault\n\
    \   management.  [LMP] defines the messages and procedures for GMPLS TE\n   link\
    \ management.  [LMP-TEST] defines SONET/SDH-specific messages and\n   procedures\
    \ for link verification.\n   ITU-T Recommendation G.8080 Amendment 1 [G.8080]\
    \ defines control\n   plane discovery as two separate processes; one process occurs\
    \ within\n   the transport plane space and the other process occurs within the\n\
    \   control plane space.\n   The ITU-T has developed Recommendation G.7714, \"\
    Generalized automatic\n   discovery techniques\" [G.7714], defining the functional\
    \ processes and\n   information exchange related to transport plane discovery\
    \ aspects,\n   i.e., layer adjacency discovery and physical media adjacency\n\
    \   discovery.  Specific methods and protocols are not defined in\n   Recommendation\
    \ G.7714.  ITU-T Recommendation G.7714.1, \"Protocol for\n   automatic discovery\
    \ in SDH and OTN networks\" [G.7714.1], defines a\n   protocol and procedure for\
    \ transport plane layer adjacency discovery\n   (e.g., discovering the transport\
    \ plane layer endpoint relationships\n   and verifying their connectivity).  The\
    \ ITU-T is currently working to\n   extend discovery to control plane aspects\
    \ providing detail on a\n   discovery framework architecture in G.8080 and a new\
    \ Recommendation\n   on \"Control plane initial establishment, reconfiguration\"\
    .\n"

- title: 2.1.  Terminology
  contents:
  - "2.1.  Terminology\n   The reader is assumed to be familiar with the terminology\
    \ in [LMP]\n   and [LMP-TEST].  The following ITU-T terminology/abbreviations\
    \ are\n   used in this document:\n   Connection Point (CP): A \"reference point\"\
    \ that consists of a pair of\n   co-located \"unidirectional connection points\"\
    \ and therefore\n   represents the binding of two paired bidirectional \"connections\"\
    .\n   Connection Termination Point (CTP): A connection termination point\n   represents\
    \ the state of a CP [M.3100].\n   Characteristic Information:  Signal with a specific\
    \ format, which is\n   transferred on \"network connections\".  The specific formats\
    \ will be\n   defined in the technology-specific recommendations.  For trails,\
    \ the\n   Characteristic Information is the payload plus the overhead.  The\n\
    \   information transferred is characteristic of the layer network.\n   Link:\
    \ A subset of ports at the edge of a subnetwork or access group\n   that are associated\
    \ with a corresponding subset of ports at the edge\n   of another subnetwork or\
    \ access group.\n   Link Connection (LC): A transport entity that transfers information\n\
    \   between ports across a link.\n   Network Connection (NC): A concatenation\
    \ of link and subnetwork\n   connections.\n   Subnetwork: A set of ports that\
    \ are available for the purpose of\n   routing 'characteristic information'.\n\
    \   Subnetwork Connection (SNC): A flexible connection that is set up and\n  \
    \ released using management or control plane procedures.\n   Subnetwork Point\
    \ (SNP): SNP is an abstraction that represents an\n   actual or potential underlying\
    \ connection point (CP) or termination\n   connection point (TCP) for the purpose\
    \ of control plane\n   representation.\n   Subnetwork Point Pool (SNPP): A set\
    \ of SNPs that are grouped together\n   for the purpose of routing.\n   Termination\
    \ Connection Point (TCP): A reference point that represents\n   the output of\
    \ a Trail Termination source function or the input to a\n   Trail Termination\
    \ sink function.  A network connection represents a\n   transport entity between\
    \ TCPs.\n   Trail Termination source/sink function: A \"transport processing\n\
    \   function\" that accepts the characteristic information of the layer\n   network\
    \ at its input, removes the information related to \"trail\"\n   monitoring, and\
    \ presents the remaining information at its output.\n   Unidirectional Connection:\
    \ A \"transport entity\" that transfers\n   information transparently from input\
    \ to output.\n   Unidirectional Connection Point: A \"reference point\" that represents\n\
    \   the binding of the output of a \"unidirectional connection\" to the\n   input\
    \ of another \"unidirectional connection\".\n"

  - "3.  Transport Network Architecture\n   A generic functional architecture for\
    \ transport networks is defined\n   in International Telecommunication Union (ITU-T)\
    \ Recommendation\n   [G.805].  This recommendation describes the functional architecture\n\
    \   of transport networks in a technology-independent way.  This\n   architecture\
    \ forms the basis for a set of technology-specific\n   architectural recommendations\
    \ for transport networks (e.g., SDH, PDH,\n   OTN, etc.).\n   The architecture\
    \ defined in G.805 is designed using a layered model\n   with a client-server\
    \ relationship between layers.  The architecture\n   is recursive in nature; a\
    \ network layer is both a server to the\n   client layer above it and a client\
    \ to the server layer below it.\n   There are two basic building blocks defined\
    \ in G.805: \"subnetworks\"\n   and \"links\".  A subnetwork is defined as a set\
    \ of ports that are\n   available for the purpose of routing \"characteristic\
    \ information\".  A\n   link consists of a subset of ports at the edge of one\
    \ subnetwork (or\n   \"access group\") and is associated with a corresponding\
    \ subset of\n   ports at the edge of another subnetwork or access group.\n   Two\
    \ types of connections are defined in G.805: link connection (LC)\n   and subnetwork\
    \ connection (SNC).  A link connection is a fixed and\n   inflexible connection,\
    \ while a subnetwork connection is flexible and\n   is set up and released using\
    \ management or control plane procedures.\n   A network connection is defined\
    \ as a concatenation of subnetwork and\n   link connections.  Figure 1 illustrates\
    \ link and subnetwork\n   connections.\n                  (++++++++)         \

    \ for the purpose of\n   identification in both the management and the control\
    \ planes.  These\n   identifiers are NOT required to be the same.  A link connection\
    \ or a\n   subnetwork connection is delimited by connection points (CPs).  A\n\
    \   network connection is delimited by a termination connection point\n   (TCP).\
    \  A link connection in the client layer is represented by a\n   pair of adaptation\
    \ functions and a trail in the server layer network.\n   A trail represents the\
    \ transfer of monitored adapted characteristics\n   information of the client\
    \ layer network between access points (APs).\n   A trail is delimited by two access\
    \ points, one at each end of the\n   trail.  Figure 2 shows a network connection\
    \ and its relationship with\n   link and subnetwork connections.  Figure 2 also\

- title: 3.1.  G.8080 Discovery Framework
  contents:
  - "3.1.  G.8080 Discovery Framework\n   G.8080 provides a reference control plane\
    \ architecture based on the\n   descriptive use of functional components representing\
    \ abstract\n   entities and abstract component interfaces.  The description is\n\
    \   generic, and no particular physical partitioning of functions is\n   implied.\
    \  The input/output information flows associated with the\n   functional components\
    \ serve for defining the functions of the\n   components and are considered to\
    \ be conceptual, not physical.\n   Components can be combined in different ways,\
    \ and the description is\n   not intended to limit implementations.  Control plane\
    \ discovery is\n   described in G.8080 by using three components: Discovery Agent\
    \ (DA),\n   Termination and Adaptation Performer (TAP), and Link Resource Manager\n\
    \   (LRM).\n   The objective of the discovery framework in G.8080 is to establish\n\
    \   the relationship between CP-CP link connections (transport plane) and\n  \
    \ SNP-SNP link connections (control plane).  The fundamental\n   characteristics\
    \ of G.8080 discovery framework is the functional\n   separation between the control\
    \ and the transport plane discovery\n   processes and name spaces.  From G.8080:\
    \ \"This separation allows\n   control plane names to be completely separate from\
    \ transport plane\n   names, and completely independent of the method used to\
    \ populate the\n   DAs with those transport names.  In order to assign an SNP-SNP\
    \ link\n   connection to an SNPP link, it is only necessary for the transport\n\
    \   name for the link connection to exist\".  Thus, it is possible to\n   assign\
    \ link connections to the control plane without the link\n   connection being\
    \ physically connected.\n   Discovery encompasses two separate processes: (1)\
    \ transport plane\n   discovery, i.e., CP-to-CP and TCP-to-TCP connectivity; and\
    \ (2)\n   control plane discovery, i.e., SNP-to-SNP and SNPP links.\n   G.8080\
    \ Amendment 1 defines the Discovery Agent (DA) as the entity\n   responsible for\
    \ discovery in the transport plane.  The DA operates in\n   the transport name\
    \ space only and in cooperation with the Termination\n   and Adaptation Performer\
    \ (TAP), provides the separation between that\n   space and the control plane\
    \ names.  A local DA is only aware of the\n   CPs and TCPs that are assigned to\
    \ it.  The DA holds the CP-CP link\n   connection in the transport plane to enable\
    \ SNP-SNP link connections\n   to be bound to them at a later time by the TAP.\
    \  The CP-CP\n   relationship may be discovered (e.g., per G.7714.1) or provided\
    \ by a\n   management system.\n   Control plane discovery takes place entirely\
    \ within the control plane\n   name space (SNPs).  The Link Resource Manager (LRM)\
    \ holds the SNP-SNP\n   binding information necessary for the control plane name\
    \ of the link\n   connection, while the termination adaptation performer (TAP)\
    \ holds\n   the relation between the control plane name (SNP) and the transport\n\
    \   plane name (CP) of the resource.  Figure 3 shows the relationship and\n  \
    \ the different entities for transport and control discoveries.\n          LRM\

    \ including\n   optical/transport networks and their resources (i.e., wavelengths,\n\
    \   timeslots, etc.) and without assuming any restriction on the control\n   plane\
    \ architecture (see [RFC3945]).  On the other hand, G.8080\n   defines a control\
    \ plane reference architecture for optical/transport\n   networks without any\
    \ restriction on the control plane implementation.\n   Being developed in separate\
    \ standards forums, and with different\n   scopes, they use different terms and\
    \ definitions.\n   Terminology mapping between LMP and ASON (G.805/G.8080) is\
    \ an\n   important step towards the understanding of the two architectures and\n\
    \   allows for potential cooperation in areas where cooperation is\n   possible.\
    \  To facilitate this mapping, we differentiate between the\n   two types of data\
    \ links in LMP.  According to LMP, a data link may be\n   considered by each node\
    \ that it terminates on as either a 'port' or a\n   'component link'.  The LMP\
    \ notions of port and component link are\n   supported by the G.805/G.8080 architecture.\
    \  G.8080's variable\n   adaptation function is broadly equivalent to LMP's component\
    \ link,\n   i.e., a single server-layer trail dynamically supporting different\n\
    \   multiplexing structures.  Note that when the data plane delivers its\n   own\
    \ addressing space, LMP Interface_IDs and Data Links IDs are used\n   as handles\
    \ by the control plane to the actual CP Name and CP-to-CP\n   Name, respectively.\n\
    \   The terminology mapping is summarized in the following table: Note\n   that\
    \ the table maps ASON terms to GMPLS terms that refer to\n   equivalent objects,\
    \ but in many cases there is not a one-to-one\n   mapping.  Additional information\
    \ beyond discovery terminology can be\n   found in [LEXICO].\n   +----------------+--------------------+-------------------+\n\

- title: 4.2.1.  TE Link Definition and Scope
  contents:
  - "4.2.1.  TE Link Definition and Scope\n   In the table, TE link/resource is equated\
    \ with the concept of SNP,\n   SNP LC, SNPP, and SNPP link.  The definition of\
    \ the TE link is broad\n   in scope, and it is useful to repeat it here.  The\
    \ original\n   definition appears in [GMPLS-RTG]:\n   \"A TE link is a logical\
    \ construct that represents a way to group/map\n   the information about certain\
    \ physical resources (and their\n   properties) that interconnects LSRs into the\
    \ information that is used\n   by Constrained SPF for GMPLS path computation,\
    \ and GMPLS signaling\".\n   While this definition is concise, it is probably\
    \ worth pointing out\n   some of the implications of the definition.\n   A component\
    \ of the TE link may follow different paths between the\n   pair of LSRs.  For\
    \ example, a TE link comprising multiple STS-3cs,\n   the individual STS-3cs component\
    \ links may take identical or\n   different physical (OC-3 and/or OC-48) paths\
    \ between LSRs.\n   The TE link construct is a logical construction encompassing\
    \ many\n   layers in networks [RFC3471].  A TE link can represent either\n   unallocated\
    \ potential or allocated actual resources.  Further\n   allocation is represented\
    \ by bandwidth reservation, and the resources\n   may be real or, in the case\
    \ of packets, virtual to allow for\n   overbooking or other forms of statistical\
    \ multiplexing schemes.\n   Since TE links may represent large numbers of parallel\
    \ resources,\n   they can be bundled for efficient summarization of resource capacity.\n\
    \   Typically, bundling represents a logical TE link resource at a\n   particular\
    \ Interface Switching Capability.  Once TE link resources\n   are allocated, the\
    \ actual capacity may be represented as LSP\n   hierarchical (tunneled) TE link\
    \ capability in another logical TE link\n   [HIER].\n   TE links also incorporate\
    \ the notion of a Forwarding Adjacency (FA)\n   and Interface Switching Capability\
    \ [RFC3945].  The FA allows\n   transport resources to be represented as TE links.\
    \  The Interface\n   Switching Capability specifies the type of transport capability\
    \ such\n   as Packet Switch Capable (PSC), Layer-2 Switch Capable (L2SC), Time-\n\
    \   Division Multiplex (TDM), Lambda Switch Capable (LSC), and Fiber-\n   Switch\
    \ Capable (FSC).\n   A TE link between GMPLS-controlled optical nodes may consist\
    \ of a\n   bundled TE link, which itself consists of a mix of point-to-point\n\
    \   component links [BUNDLE].  A TE link is identified by the tuple (link\n  \
    \ Identifier (32-bit number), Component link Identifier (32-bit\n   number), and\
    \ generalized label (media specific)).\n"
- title: 4.3.  LMP and G.8080 Discovery Relationship
  contents:
  - "4.3.  LMP and G.8080 Discovery Relationship\n   LMP currently consists of four\
    \ primary procedures, of which the first\n   two are mandatory and the last two\
    \ are optional:\n         1.  Control channel management\n         2.  Link property\
    \ correlation\n         3.  Link verification\n         4.  Fault management\n\
    \   LMP procedures that are relevant to G.8080 control plane discovery\n   are\
    \ control channel management, link property correlation, and link\n   verification.\
    \  Key to understanding G.8080 discovery aspects in\n   relation to [LMP] is that\
    \ LMP procedures are specific for an IP-based\n   control plane abstraction of\
    \ the transport plane.\n   LMP control channel management is used to establish\
    \ and maintain\n   control channel connectivity between LMP adjacent nodes.  In\
    \ GMPLS,\n   the control channels between two adjacent nodes are not required\
    \ to\n   use the same physical medium as the TE links between those nodes.\n \
    \  The control channels that are used to exchange the GMPLS control\n   plane\
    \ information exist independently of the TE links they manage\n   (i.e., control\
    \ channels may be in-band or out-of-band, provided the\n   associated control\
    \ points terminate the LMP packets).  The Link\n   Management Protocol [LMP] was\
    \ designed to manage TE links,\n   independently of the physical medium capabilities\
    \ of the data links.\n   Link property correlation is used to aggregate multiple\
    \ data links\n   into a single TE link and to synchronize the link properties.\n\
    \   Link verification is used to verify the physical connectivity of the\n   data\
    \ links and verify the mapping of the Interface-ID to Link-ID (CP\n   to SNP).\
    \  The local-to-remote associations can be obtained using a\n   priori knowledge\
    \ or using the link verification procedure.\n   Fault management is primarily\
    \ used to suppress alarms and to localize\n   failures.  It is an optional LMP\
    \ procedure; its use will depend on\n   the specific technology's capabilities.\n\
    \   [LMP] supports distinct transport and control plane name spaces with\n   the\
    \ (out-of-band) TRACE object (see [LMP-TEST]).  The LMP TRACE\n   object allows\
    \ transport plane names to be associated with interface\n   identifiers [LMP-TEST].\n\
    \   Aspects of LMP link verification appear similar to G.7714.1\n   discovery;\
    \ however, the two procedures are different.  G.7714.1\n   provides discovery\
    \ of the transport plane layer adjacencies.  It\n   provides a generic procedure\
    \ to discover the connectivity of two\n   endpoints in the transport plane.  On\
    \ the other hand, the LMP link\n   verification procedure is a control-plane-driven\
    \ procedure and\n   assumes either (1) a priori knowledge of the associated data\
    \ plane's\n   local and remote endpoint connectivity and Interface_IDs (e.g.,\
    \ via\n   management plane or use of G.7714.1), or (2) support of the remote\n\
    \   node for associating the data interface being verified with the\n   content\
    \ of the TRACE object (inferred mapping).  For SONET/SDH\n   transport networks,\
    \ LMP verification uses the SONET/SDH Trail Trace\n   identifier (see [G.783]).\n\
    \   G.7714.1 supports the use of transport plane discovery independent of\n  \
    \ the platform using the capability.  Furthermore, G.7714.1 specifies\n   the\
    \ use of a Discovery Agent that could be located in an external\n   system and\
    \ the need to support the use of text-oriented man-machine\n   language to provide\
    \ the interface.  Therefore, G.7714.1 limits the\n   discovery messages to printable\
    \ characters defined by [T.50] and\n   requires Base64 encoding for the TCP-ID\
    \ and DA ID.  External name-\n   servers may be used to resolve the G.7714.1 TCP\
    \ name, allowing the\n   TCP to have an IP, Network Service Access Protocol (NSAP),\
    \ or any\n   other address format.  On the other hand, LMP is based on the use\
    \ of\n   an IP-based control plane, and the LMP interface ID uses IPv4, IPv6,\n\
    \   or unnumbered interface IDs.\n"

  contents:
  - "4.4.  Comparing LMP and G.8080\n   LMP exists to support GMPLS TE resource and\
    \ TE link discovery.  In\n   section 4.2.1, we elaborated on the definition of\
    \ the TE link.  LMP\n   enables the aspects of TE links to be discovered and reported\
    \ to the\n   control plane, more specifically, the routing plane.  G.8080 and\n\
    \   G.7714 are agnostic to the type of control plane and discovery\n   protocol\
    \ used.  LMP is a valid realization of a control plane\n   discovery process under\
    \ a G.8080 model.\n   G.7714 specifies transport plane discovery with respect\
    \ to the\n   transport layer CTPs or TCPs using ASON conventions and naming for\n\
    \   the elements of the ASON control plane and the ASON management plane.\n  \
    \ This discovery supports a centralized management model of\n   configuration\
    \ as well as a distributed control plane model; in other\n   words, discovered\
    \ items can be reported to the management plane or\n   the control plane.  G.7714.1\
    \ provides one realization of a transport\n   plane discovery process.\n   Today,\
    \ LMP and G.7714, G7714.1 are defined in different standards\n   organizations.\
    \  They have evolved out of different naming schemes and\n   architectural concepts.\
    \  Whereas G.7714.1 supports a transport plane\n   layer adjacency connectivity\
    \ verification that can be used by a\n   control plane or a management plane,\
    \ LMP is a control plane procedure\n   for managing GMPLS TE links (GMPLS's control\
    \ plane representation of\n   the transport plane connections).\n"
