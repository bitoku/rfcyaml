- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   As shown by [RFC6036], many service providers are actively\
    \ planning\n   to deploy IPv6 to alleviate the imminent shortage of IPv4 addresses.\n\
    \   This will affect all service providers who have implemented\n   [RFC1149].\
    \  It is therefore necessary, indeed urgent, to specify a\n   method of transmitting\
    \ IPv6 datagrams [RFC2460] over the RFC 1149\n   medium, rather than obliging\
    \ those service providers to migrate to a\n   different medium.  This document\
    \ offers such a specification.\n"
- title: 2.  Normative Notation
  contents:
  - "2.  Normative Notation\n   The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\"\
    , \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"\
    MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n   document are to be interpreted as described\
    \ in [RFC2119].\n"
- title: 3.  Detailed Specification
  contents:
  - "3.  Detailed Specification\n   Unless otherwise stated, the provisions of [RFC1149]\
    \ and [RFC2460]\n   apply throughout.\n"
- title: 3.1.  Maximum Transmission Unit
  contents:
  - "3.1.  Maximum Transmission Unit\n   As noted in RFC 1149, the MTU is variable,\
    \ and generally increases\n   with increased carrier age.  Since the minimum link\
    \ MTU allowed by\n   RFC 2460 is 1280 octets, this means that older carriers MUST\
    \ be used\n   for IPv6.  RFC 1149 does not provide exact conversion factors between\n\
    \   age and milligrams, or between milligrams and octets.  These\n   conversion\
    \ factors are implementation dependent, but as an\n   illustrative example, we\
    \ assume that the 256 milligram MTU suggested\n   in RFC 1149 corresponds to an\
    \ MTU of 576 octets.  In that case, the\n   typical MTU for the present specification\
    \ will be at least\n   256*1280/576, which is approximately 569 milligrams.  Again\
    \ as an\n   illustrative example, this is likely to require a carrier age of at\n\
    \   least 365 days.\n   Furthermore, the MTU issues are non-linear with carrier\
    \ age.  That\n   is, a young carrier can only carry small payloads, an adult carrier\n\
    \   can carry jumbograms [RFC2675], and an elderly carrier can again\n   carry\
    \ only smaller payloads.  There is also an effect on transit time\n   depending\
    \ on carrier age, affecting bandwidth-delay product and hence\n   the performance\
    \ of TCP.\n"
- title: 3.2.  Frame Format
  contents:
  - "3.2.  Frame Format\n   RFC 1149 does not specify the use of any link layer tag\
    \ such as an\n   Ethertype or, worse, an OSI Link Layer or SNAP header [RFC1042].\n\
    \   Indeed, header snaps are known to worsen the quality of service\n   provided\
    \ by RFC 1149 carriers.  In the interests of efficiency and to\n   avoid excessive\
    \ energy consumption while packets are in flight\n   through the network, no such\
    \ link layer tag is required for IPv6\n   packets either.  The frame format is\
    \ therefore a pure IPv6 packet as\n   defined in [RFC2460], encoded and decoded\
    \ as defined in [RFC1149].\n   One important consequence of this is that in a\
    \ dual-stack deployment\n   [RFC4213], the receiver MUST inspect the IP protocol\
    \ version number\n   in the first four bits of every packet, as the only means\
    \ to\n   demultiplex a mixture of IPv4 and IPv6 packets.\n"
- title: 3.3.  Address Configuration
  contents:
  - "3.3.  Address Configuration\n   The lack of any form of link layer protocol means\
    \ that link-local\n   addresses cannot be formed, as there is no way to address\
    \ anything\n   except the other end of the link.\n   Similarly, there is no method\
    \ to map an IPv6 unicast address to a\n   link layer address, since there is no\
    \ link layer address in the first\n   place.  IPv6 Neighbor Discovery [RFC4861]\
    \ is therefore impossible.\n   Implementations SHOULD NOT even try to use stateless\
    \ address auto-\n   configuration [RFC4862].  This recommendation is because this\n\
    \   mechanism requires a stable interface identifier formed in a way\n   compatible\
    \ with [RFC4291].  Unfortunately the transmission elements\n   specified by RFC\
    \ 1149 are not generally stable enough for this and\n   may become highly unstable\
    \ in the presence of a cross-wind.\n   In most deployments, either the end points\
    \ of the link remain\n   unnumbered, or a /127 prefix and static addresses MAY\
    \ be assigned.\n   See [IPv6-PREFIXLEN] for further discussion.\n"
- title: 3.4.  Multicast
  contents:
  - "3.4.  Multicast\n   RFC 1149 does not specify a multicast address mapping.  It\
    \ has been\n   reported that attempts to implement IPv4 multicast delivery have\n\
    \   resulted in excessive noise in transmission elements, with subsequent\n  \
    \ drops of packet digests.  At the present time, an IPv6 multicast\n   mapping\
    \ has not been specified, to avoid such problems.\n"
- title: 4.  Quality-of-Service Considerations
  contents:
  - "4.  Quality-of-Service Considerations\n   [RFC2549] is also applicable in the\
    \ IPv6 case.  However, the author\n   of RFC 2549 did not take account of the\
    \ availability of the\n   Differentiated Services model [RFC2474].  IPv6 packets\
    \ carrying a\n   non-default Differentiated Services Code Point (DSCP) value in\
    \ their\n   Traffic Class field [RFC2460] MUST be specially encoded using green\n\
    \   or blue ink such that the DSCP is externally visible.  Note that red\n   ink\
    \ MUST NOT be used to avoid confusion with the usage of red paint\n   specified\
    \ in RFC 2549.\n   RFC 2549 did not consider the impact on quality of service\
    \ of\n   different types of carriers.  There is a broad range.  Some are very\n\
    \   fast but can only carry small payloads and transit short distances,\n   others\
    \ are slower but carry large payloads and transit very large\n   distances.  It\
    \ may be appropriate to select the individual carrier\n   for a packet on the\
    \ basis of its DSCP value.  Indeed, different\n   carriers will implement different\
    \ per-hop behaviors according to RFC\n   2474.\n"
- title: 5.  Routing and Tunneling Considerations
  contents:
  - "5.  Routing and Tunneling Considerations\n   Routing carriers through the territory\
    \ of similar carriers, without\n   peering agreements, will sometimes cause abrupt\
    \ route changes,\n   looping packets, and out-of-order delivery.  Similarly, routing\n\
    \   carriers through the territory of predatory carriers may potentially\n   cause\
    \ severe packet loss.  It is strongly recommended that these\n   factors be considered\
    \ in the routing algorithm used to create carrier\n   routing tables.  Implementers\
    \ should consider policy-based routing to\n   ensure reliable packet delivery\
    \ by routing around areas where\n   territorial and predatory carriers are prevalent.\n\
    \   There is evidence that some carriers have a propensity to eat other\n   carriers\
    \ and then carry the eaten payloads.  Perhaps this provides a\n   new way to tunnel\
    \ an IPv4 packet in an IPv6 payload, or vice versa.\n   However, the decapsulation\
    \ mechanism is unclear at the time of this\n   writing.\n"
- title: 6.  Multihoming Considerations
  contents:
  - "6.  Multihoming Considerations\n   Some types of carriers are notoriously good\
    \ at homing.  Surprisingly,\n   this property is not mentioned in RFC 1149.  Unfortunately,\
    \ they\n   prove to have no talent for multihoming, and in fact enter a routing\n\
    \   loop whenever multihoming is attempted.  This appears to be a\n   fundamental\
    \ restriction on the topologies in which both RFC 1149 and\n   the present specification\
    \ can be deployed.\n"
- title: 7.  Internationalization Considerations
  contents:
  - "7.  Internationalization Considerations\n   In some locations, such as New Zealand,\
    \ a significant proportion of\n   carriers are only able to execute short hops,\
    \ and only at times when\n   the background level of photon emission is extremely\
    \ low.  This will\n   impact the availability and throughput of the solution in\
    \ such\n   locations.\n"
- title: 8.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "8.  Security Considerations\n   The security considerations of [RFC1149] apply.\
    \  In addition, recent\n   experience suggests that the transmission elements\
    \ are exposed to\n   many different forms of denial-of-service attacks, especially\
    \ when\n   perching.  Also, the absence of link layer identifiers referred to\n\
    \   above, combined with the lack of checksums in the IPv6 header,\n   basically\
    \ means that any transmission element could be mistaken for\n   any other, with\
    \ no means of detecting the substitution at the network\n   layer.  The use of\
    \ an upper-layer security mechanism of some kind\n   seems like a really good\
    \ idea.\n   There is a known risk of infection by the so-called H5N1 virus.\n\
    \   Appropriate detection and quarantine measures MUST be available.\n"
- title: 9.  IANA Considerations
  contents:
  - "9.  IANA Considerations\n   This document requests no action by IANA.  However,\
    \ registry clean-up\n   may be necessary after interoperability testing, especially\
    \ if\n   multicast has been attempted.\n"

  contents:
  - "10.  Acknowledgements\n   Steve Deering was kind enough to review this document\
    \ for conformance\n   with IPv6 requirements.  We acknowledge in advance the many\
    \ errata in\n   this document that will be reported by Alfred Hoenes.\n   This\
