- contents:
  - "Status of this Memo\n   This document specifies a standard method of encapsulating
    the\n   Internet Protocol [1] (IP) datagrams on NetBIOS [2] networks.\n   Distribution
    of this memo is unlimited.\n"
  title: Status of this Memo
- contents:
  - "Introduction\n   The goal of this specification is to allow compatible and\n
    \  interoperable implementations for transmitting IP datagrams over\n   NetBIOS
    networks.\n   NetBIOS is a standard which specifies a means of creating virtual\n
    \  circuits and of transmitting and receiving point-to-point, multicast,\n   and
    broadcast datagrams.  This specification uses only the datagram\n   services.\n
    \  Previous versions of this memo specified the use of the NetBIOS\n   broadcast
    datagram services instead of the NetBIOS group name\n   services to implement
    IP broadcasting.  These versions are now\n   obsolete.\n"
  title: Introduction
- contents:
  - "Description\n   NetBIOS networks may be used to support IP networks and subnets
    [3]\n   of any class.  By means of encapsulating IP datagrams within NetBIOS\n
    \  datagrams and assigning IP numbers to the hosts on a NetBIOS network,\n   IP-based
    applications are supported on these hosts.  The addition of\n   a router capable
    of encapsulating IP packets within ordinary data-\n   link protocols (such as
    802.3 [4]) as well as within NetBIOS\n   datagrams allows these NetBIOS hosts
    to communicate with the Internet\n   at large.\n"

  - "Address Mappings\n   In general, NetBIOS names may be any series of 16 bytes,
    however, a\n   few values are reserved or used by common networking packages.\n
    \  NetBIOS names for the IP applications on each host are chosen on the\n   basis
    of the internet number of that host.  Since NetBIOS names are a\n   mapping of
    IP addresses, no physical address query mechanism (e.g.,\n   ARP [5]) is required.\n
    \  For these internet protocol applications, IP.XX.XX.XX.XX is the\n   NetBIOS
    name for any IP over NetBIOS host where XX represents the\n   ascii hexadecimal
    representation of that byte of the internet\n   address.\n   This addressing scheme
    allows for the multiplexing of standard\n   datagram protocols over NetBIOS as
    well as easy visual confirmation\n   of the correctness of a given packet's address.\n"

  - "Broadcast and Multicast Addresses\n   Broadcast Internet addresses are represented
    by the NetBIOS group\n   name IP.FF.FF.FF.FF.  Currently, no attempt is made to
    provide\n   support of IP multicast addresses using NetBIOS group names.\n"

  - "Maximum Transmission Unit\n   The maximum data size of a NetBIOS datagram, and
    therefore the\n   Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU) for IP over NetBIOS networks,
    is 512\n   bytes.  Therefore, any hosts communicating with a host on a NetBIOS\n
    \  network may be required to reassemble fragmented datagrams.\n"

  - "Implementation\n   To support IP on a NetBIOS host for any given IP address the\n
    \  initialization code must:\n       1) Add IP.XX.XX.XX.XX to the host's NetBIOS
    name table.\n       2) Add IP.FF.FF.FF.FF to the host's NetBIOS group name table.\n
    \      3) Submit a receive datagram request for the reception of NetBIOS\n          datagrams
    destined for IP.XX.XX.XX.XX.\n       4) Submit a receive datagram request for
    the reception of NetBIOS\n          datagrams destined for IP.FF.FF.FF.FF.\n   When
    a NetBIOS datagram to either address is received, it is\n   processed by the protocol
    stack and another receive datagram request\n   is submitted.\n   When an IP datagram
    is sent, it is considered to be NetBIOS datagram\n   data and sent by a send datagram
    request to either IP.XX.XX.XX.XX or\n   IP.FF.FF.FF.FF.\n   Optionally, the IP
    software may desire to make adapter status queries\n   of the NetBIOS network.
    \ As support for SNMP becomes a requirement\n   for IP hosts, these adapter status
    queries may become mandatory.\n   Finally, when the IP support for a given NetBIOS
    host is\n   discontinued, a cancel command request should be submitted for every\n
    \  pending receive datagram, and a delete name request should be\n   submitted
    for both the IP.XX.XX.XX.XX and IP.FF.FF.FF.FF address\n   added during initialization.\n"

  - "Acknowledgements\n   This document would not have been possible without the efforts
    of\n   John Bartas, James Davidson, and Dan Ladermann in the early design\n   and
    implementation of IP over NetBIOS.\n"
