  - "1.  Definitions for this document\n   The NSFNET is the backbone network of the\
    \ National Science\n   Foundation's computer network infrastructure.  It interconnects\n\
    \   multiple autonomously administered mid-level networks, which in turn\n   connect\
    \ autonomously administered networks of campuses and research\n   centers.  The\
    \ NSFNET connects to multiple peer networks consisting of\n   national network\
    \ infrastructures of other federal agencies.  One of\n   these peer networks is\
    \ the Defense Data Network (DDN) which, for the\n   sake of this discussion, should\
    \ be viewed as the combination of the\n   DoD's MILNET and ARPANET component networks,\
    \ both of which are\n   national in scope.\n   It should be pointed out that network\
    \ announcements in one direction\n   result in traffic the other direction, e.g.,\
    \ a network announcement\n   via a specific interconnection between the NSFNET\
    \ to the DDN results\n   in packet traffic via the same interconnection between\
    \ the DDN to the\n   NSFNET.\n"

  - "2.  NSFNET/DDN routing until mid '89\n   Until mid-1989, the NSFNET and the DDN\
    \ were connected via a few\n   intermediate routers which in turn were connected\
    \ to the ARPANET.\n   These routers exchanged network reachability information\
    \ via the\n   Exterior Gateway Protocol (EGP) with the NSFNET nodes as well as\
    \ with\n   the DDN Mailbridges.  In the context of network routing these\n   Mailbridges\
    \ can be viewed as route servers, which exchange external\n   network reachability\
    \ information via EGP while using a proprietary\n   protocol to exchange routing\
    \ information among themselves.\n   Currently, there are three Mailbridges at\
    \ east coast locations and\n   three Mailbridges at west coast locations.  Besides\
    \ functioning as\n   route servers the Mailbridges also provide for connectivity,\
    \ i.e,\n   packet switching, between the ARPANET and the MILNET.\n   The intermediate\
    \ systems between the NSFNET and the ARPANET were\n   under separate administrative\
    \ control, typically by a NSFNET mid-\n   level network.\n   For a period of time,\
    \ the traffic between the NSFNET and the DDN was\n   carried by three ARPANET\
    \ gateways.  These ARPANET gateways were under\n   the administrative control\
    \ of a NSFNET mid-level network or local\n   site and had direct connections to\
    \ both a NSFNET NSS and an ARPANET\n   PSN.  These routers had simultaneous EGP\
    \ sessions with a NSFNET NSS\n   as well as a DDN Mailbridge.  This resulted in\
    \ making them function\n   as packet switches between the two peer networks. \
    \ As network routes\n   were established packets were switched between the NSFNET\
    \ and the\n   DDN.\n   The NSFNET used three NSFNET/ARPANET gateways which had\
    \ been provided\n   by three different sites for redundancy purposes.  Those three\
    \ sites\n   were initially at Cornell University, the University of Illinois\n\
    \   (UC), and Merit.  When the ARPANET connections at Cornell University\n   and\
    \ the University of Illinois (UC) were terminated, a similar setup\n   was introduced\
    \ at the Pittsburgh Supercomputer Center and at the John\n   von Neumann Supercomputer\
    \ Center which, together with the Merit\n   connection, allowed for continued\
    \ redundancy.\n   As described in RFC1092 and RFC1093, NSFNET routing is controlled\
    \ by\n   a distributed policy routing database that controls the acceptance\n\
    \   and distribution of routing information.  This control also extends\n   to\
    \ the NSFNET/ARPANET gateways.\n"

  - "2.1  Inbound announcement -- Routes announced from the DDN to the\n     NSFNET\n\
    \   In the case of the three NSFNET/ARPANET gateways, each of the\n   associated\
    \ NSSs accepted the DDN routes at a different metric.  The\n   route with the\
    \ lowest metric then was favored for the traffic towards\n   the specific DDN\
    \ network, but had that specific gateway to the DDN\n   experienced problems with\
    \ loss of routing information, one of the\n   redundant gateways would take over\
    \ and carry the load as a fallback\n   path.  Assuming consistent DDN routing\
    \ information at any of the\n   three gateways, as received from the Mailbridges,\
    \ only a single\n   NSFNET/ARPANET gateway was used at a given time for traffic\
    \ from the\n   NSFNET towards the DDN, with two further gateways standing by as\
    \ hot\n   backups.  The metric for network announcements from the DDN to the\n\
    \   NSFNET was coordinated by the Merit/NSFNET project.\n"

  contents:
  - "2.2  Outbound announcement -- Routes announced from the NSFNET to the\n     DDN\n\
    \   Each NSS involved with NSFNET/DDN routing had an EGP peer relation\n   with\
    \ the NSFNET/ARPANET gateway.  Via EGP it announced a certain set\n   of NSFNET\
    \ connected networks, again, as controlled by the distributed\n   policy routing\
    \ database, to its peer.  The NSFNET/ARPANET gateway\n   then redistributed the\
    \ networks it had learned from the NSS to the\n   DDN via a separate EGP session.\
    \  Each of the NSFNET/ARPANET gateways\n   used a separate Autonomous System number\
    \ to communicate EGP\n   information with the DDN.  Also these Autonomous System\
    \ numbers were\n   not the same as the NSFNET backbone uses to communicate with\
    \ directly\n   attached client networks.  The NSFNET/ARPANET gateways used the\n\
    \   Autonomous System number of the local network.  The metrics for\n   announcing\
    \ network numbers to the DDN Mailbridges were set according\n   to the requests\
    \ of the mid-level network of which the specific\n   individual network was a\
    \ client.  Mid-level network also influenced\n   the specific NSFNET/ARPANET gateway\
    \ used, including primary/secondary\n   selection.  These primary/secondary selections\
    \ among the\n   NSFNET/ARPANET gateways allowed for redundancy, while the preference\n\
    \   of network announcements was modulated by the metric used for the\n   announcements\
    \ to the DDN from the NSFNET/ARPANET gateways.  Some of\n   the selection decisions\
    \ were based on reliability of a specific\n   gateway or congestion expected in\
    \ a specific PSN that connected to\n   the NSFNET/ARPANET gateway.\n"

- title: 3.  NSFNET/DDN routing via attached Mailbridges
  contents:
  - "3.  NSFNET/DDN routing via attached Mailbridges\n   During the first half of\
    \ 1989 a new means of interconnectivity\n   between the NSFNET and the DDN was\
    \ designed and implemented.\n   Ethernet adapters were installed in two of the\
    \ Mailbridges, which\n   previously just connected the MILNET and the ARPANET,\
    \ allowing a\n   direct interface to NSFNET nodes.  Of these two Mailbridges one\
    \ is\n   located on the west coast at NASA-Ames located at Moffett Field, CA,\n\
    \   and the other one is located on the east coast at Mitre in Reston,\n   VA.\
    \  With this direct interconnection it became possible for the\n   NSFNET to exchange\
    \ routing information directly with the DDN route\n   servers, without a gateway\
    \ operated by a mid-level network in the\n   middle.  This also eliminated the\
    \ need to traverse the ARPANET in\n   order to reach MILNET sites.  It furthermore\
    \ allows the Defense\n   Communication Agency as well as the National Science\
    \ Foundation to\n   exercise control over the interconnection on a need basis,\
    \ e.g., the\n   connectivity can now be easily disabled from either site at times\
    \ of\n   tighter network security concerns.\n"

  contents:
  - "3.1  Inbound announcement -- Routes announced from the DDN to the\n     NSFNET\n\
    \   The routing setup for the direct Mailbridge connections is somewhat\n   different,\
    \ as compared to the previously used NSFNET/ARPANET\n   gateways.  Instead of\
    \ a single NSFNET/ARPANET gateway carrying all\n   the traffic from the DDN to\
    \ the NSFNET at any moment, the\n   distribution of network numbers is now split\
    \ between the two\n   Mailbridges.  This results in a distributed load, with specific\n\
    \   network numbers always preferring a particular Mailbridge under\n   normal\
    \ operating circumstances.  In the case of an outage at one of\n   the Mailbridge\
    \ connections, the other one fully takes over the load\n   for all the involved\
    \ network numbers.  For this setup, the two DDN\n   links are known as two different\
    \ Autonomous System numbers by the\n   NSFNET.  The routes learned via the NASA-Ames\
    \ Mailbridges are part of\n   the Autonomous System 164 which is also the Autonomous\
    \ System number\n   which the Mailbridges are using by themselves during the EGP\
    \ session.\n   In the case of the EGP sessions with the Mitre Mailbridge, the\
    \ DDN-\n   internal Autonomous System number of 164 is overwritten with a\n  \
    \ different Autonomous System number (in this case 184) and the routes\n   learned\
    \ via the Mitre Mailbridge will therefore become part of\n   Autonomous System\
    \ 184 within the NSFNET.\n   The NSFNET-inbound routing is controlled by the distributed\
    \ policy\n   routing database.  In particular, the network number is verified\n\
    \   against a list of legitimate networks, and a metric is associated\n   with\
    \ an authorized network number for a particular site.  For\n   example, both NSSs\
    \ in Palo Alto and College Park learn net 10 (the\n   ARPANET network number)\
    \ from the Mailbridges they are connected to\n   and have EGP sessions.  The Palo\
    \ Alto NSS will accept Net 10 with a\n   metric of 10, while the College Park\
    \ NSS will accept the same network\n   number with a metric of 12.  Therefore,\
    \ traffic destinated to net 10\n   will prefer the path via the Palo Alto NSS\
    \ and the NASA-Ames\n   Mailbridge.  If the connection via the NASA-Ames Mailbridge\
    \ is not\n   functioning, the traffic will be re-routed via the Mailbridge link\
    \ at\n   Mitre.  Each of the two NSS accepts half of the network routes via\n\
    \   EGP from its co- located Mailbridge at a lower metric and the other\n   half\
    \ at a higher metric.  The half with the lower metric at the Palo\n   Alto NSS\
    \ will be the same set which uses a higher metric at the\n   College Park NSS\
    \ and vice versa.\n   There are at least three different possibilities about how\
    \ the NSFNET\n   could select a path to a DDN network via a specific Mailbridge,\
    \ i.e.,\n   the one at NASA-Ames versus the one at Mitre:\n      1.  Assign a\
    \ primary path for all DDN networks to a single\n          Mailbridge and use\
    \ the other purely as a backup path.\n      2.  Distribute the DDN networks randomly\
    \ across the two\n          Mailbridges.\n      3.  Let the DDN administration\
    \ inform the NSFNET which networks\n          on the DDN are closer to a specific\
    \ Mailbridge so that the\n          particular Mailbridge would accept these networks\
    \ at a lower\n          metric.  The second Mailbridge would then function as\
    \ a backup\n          path.  From a NSFNET point of view, this would mean treating\
    \ the\n          DDN like other NSFNET peer networks such as the NASA Science\n\
    \          network (NSN) or DOE's Energy Science Network (ESNET).\n   We are currently\
    \ using alternative (2) as an interim solution.  At\n   this time, the DDN administration\
    \ is having discussions with NSFNET\n   about moving to alternative (3), which\
    \ would allow them control over\n   how the DDN networks would be treated in the\
    \ NSFNET.\n"

    \   The selection of metrics for announcements of NSFNET networks to the\n   DDN\
    \ is controlled by the NSFNET.  The criteria for the metric\n   decisions is based\
    \ on distances between the NSS, which introduces a\n   specific network into the\
    \ NSFNET, and either one of the NSSs that has\n   a co-located Mailbridge.  In\
    \ this context, the distance translates\n   into the hop count between NSSs in\
    \ the NSFNET backbone.  For example,\n   the Princeton NSS is currently one hop\
    \ away from the NSS co-located\n   with the Mitre Mailbridge, but is three hops\
    \ away from the NSS with\n   the NASA-Ames Mailbridge.  Therefore, in the case\
    \ of networks with\n   primary paths via the Princeton NSS, the Mitre Mailbridge\
    \ will\n   receive the announcements for those networks at a lower metric than\n\
    \   the NASA-Ames Mailbridge.  This means that the traffic from the DDN\n   to\
    \ networks connected to the Princeton NSS will be routed through the\n   Mailbridge\
    \ at Mitre to the College Park NSS and then through the\n   Princeton NSS to its\
    \ final destination.  This will guarantee that\n   traffic entering the NSFNET\

    \   For networks that do not have a DDN connection other than via NSFNET,\n  \
    \ the NSFNET will announce the nets via one of the Mailbridges with a\n   low\
    \ metric to create a primary path (e.g., metric \"1\") and via the\n   second\
    \ Mailbridge as a secondary path (e.g., metric \"3\").  For\n   networks that\

  - "4.  Shortcomings of the current NSFNET/DDN interconnection routing\n   The current\
    \ setup makes full use of the two Mailbridges that connect\n   to the NSFNET directly,\
    \ with regard to redundancy and load sharing.\n   However, with regard to performance\
    \ optimization, such as packet\n   propagation delay between source/destination\
    \ pairs located on\n   disjoint peer networks, there are some shortcomings.  These\n\
    \   shortcomings are not easy to overcome because of the limitations of\n   the\
    \ current architecture.  However, it is a worthwhile topic for\n   discussion\
    \ to aid future improvements.\n   To make the discussion easier, the following\
    \ assumptions and\n   terminology will be used:\n      The NSFNET is viewed as\
    \ a cloud and so is the DDN.  The two have\n      two connections, one at east\

    \ -- networks connected to NSFNET and physically closer\n                    \
    \  to NSS-west\n   The traffic between NSFNET<->DDN will fall into the following\n\
    \   patterns:\n      a) NSF.east-net <-> DDN.east-net or\n         NSF.west-net\

    \        the DDN backbone\n        The traffic for a) will transcontinentally\
    \ traverse NEITHER the\n        NSFNET backbone, NOR the DDN backbone.\n     \
    \   The traffic for b) will transcontinentally traverse NSFNET once\n        and\
    \ DDN once and only once for each.\n   For the current set up,\n   The traffic\
    \ path for pattern a) would have chances to\n   transcontinentally traverse both\
    \ NSFNET and DDN.\n   The traffic path for pattern b) would have chances to\n\
    \   transcontinentally traverse the DDN in both directions.\n   To achieve the\
    \ ideal traffic path it requires the NSFNET to implement\n   (3) as stated above,\
    \ i.e., to treat the DDN like other NSFNET peer or\n   mid-level networks.  As\
    \ mentioned before, discussions between NSFNET\n   and DDN people are underway\
    \ and the DDN is considering providing the\n   NSFNET with the required information\
    \ to accomplish the outlined goals\n   in the near future.\n   At such time as\
    \ this is accomplished, it will reduce the likelihood\n   of packet traffic unnecessarily\
    \ traversing national backbones.\n   One of the best ways to optimize the traffic\
    \ between two peer\n   networks, not necessary limited to the NSFNET and the DDN,\
    \ is to try\n   to avoid letting traffic traverse a backbone with a comparatively\n\
    \   slower speed and/or a backbone with a significantly larger diameter\n   network.\
    \  For example, in the case of traffic between the NSFNET and\n   the DDN, the\
    \ NSFNET has a T1 backbone and a maximum diameter of three\n   hops, while the\
    \ DDN is a relatively slow network running largely at\n   56Kbps.  In this case\
    \ the overall performance would be better if\n   traffic would traverse the DDN\
    \ as little as possible, i.e., whenever\n   the traffic has to reach a destination\
    \ network outside of the DDN, it\n   should find the closest Mailbridge to exit\
    \ the DDN.\n   The current architecture employed for DDN routing is not able to\n\
    \   accomplish this.  Firstly, the technology is designed based on a core\n  \
    \ model.  It does not expect a single network to be announced by\n   multiple\
    \ places.  An example for multiple announcements could be two\n   NSSs announcing\
    \ a single network number to the two Mailbridges at\n   their different locations.\
    \  Secondly, the way all the existing\n   Mailbridges exchange routing information\
    \ among themselves is done via\n   a protocol similar to EGP, and the information\
    \ is then distributed\n   via EGP to the DDN-external networks.  In this case\
    \ the physical\n   distance information and locations of network numbers is lost\
    \ and\n   neither the Mailbridges nor the external gateways will be able to do\n\
    \   path optimization based on physical distance and/or propagation\n   delay.\
    \  This is not easy to change, as in the DDN the link level\n   routing information\
    \ is decoupled from the IP level routing, i.e., the\n   IP level routing has no\
    \ information about topology of the physical\n   infrastructure.  Thus, even if\
    \ an external gateway to a DDN network\n   were to learn a particular network\
    \ route from two Mailbridges, it\n   would not be able to favor one over the other\
    \ DDN exit point based on\n   the distance to the respective Mailbridge.\n"
