GCM Based Cipher Suites .
PSK Based Cipher Suites .
The Camellia cipher suites are already specified in RFC 5932 [15] with SHA 256 based Hashed Message Authentication Code (HMAC) using asymmetric key encryption.
This document proposes the addition of new cipher suites to the Transport Layer Security (TLS) [8] protocol to support the Camellia [4] cipher algorithm as a block cipher algorithm.
The proposed cipher suites include variants using the SHA 2 family of cryptographic hash functions [13] and Galois Counter Mode (GCM) [14].
Elliptic curve cipher suites and pre shared key (PSK)
[5] cipher suites are also included.
The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [3].
The eight cipher suites use Camellia
[4] in Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) [4] mode with a SHA 2 family HMAC using the elliptic curve cryptosystem:
CipherSuite TLS ECDHE ECDSA WITH CAMELLIA 128
; CipherSuite TLS ECDHE ECDSA WITH CAMELLIA 256 CBC SHA384   {0xC0,0x73}; CipherSuite TLS ECDH ECDSA WITH CAMELLIA 128
The twenty cipher suites use the same asymmetric key algorithms as those in the previous section but use the authenticated encryption modes defined in TLS 1.2 [8] with Camellia in GCM [14].
CipherSuite TLS RSA WITH CAMELLIA 128
; CipherSuite TLS ECDH ECDSA WITH CAMELLIA 128 GCM
The fourteen cipher suites describe PSK cipher suites.
The first six cipher suites use Camellia with GCM, and
the next eight cipher suites use Camellia with SHA 2 family HMAC using asymmetric key encryption or the elliptic curve cryptosystem.
CipherSuite TLS PSK WITH CAMELLIA 128
CipherSuite TLS DHE PSK WITH CAMELLIA 128
The RSA, DHE RSA, DH RSA, DHE DSS, DH DSS, ECDH, DH anon, and ECDHE key exchanges are performed as defined in RFC 5246 [8].
This document describes cipher suites based on Camellia cipher using CBC mode and GCM.
The details are as follows.
The CAMELLIA 128 CBC cipher suites use Camellia [4] in CBC mode with a 128 bit key and 128 bit Initialization Vector (IV); the CAMELLIA 256 CBC cipher suites use a 256 bit key and 128 bit IV.
[19] authenticated encryption with additional data algorithms, AEAD AES 128 GCM and AEAD AES 256 GCM, are described in RFC 5116 [7].
AES GCM cipher suites for TLS are described in RFC 5288 [9].
AES and Camellia share common characteristics including key sizes and block length.
CAMELLIA 128 GCM and CAMELLIA 256 GCM are defined according to those of AES.
The hash algorithms and pseudorandom function (PRF) algorithms for TLS 1.2 [8] SHALL be as follows:
The cipher suites ending with  SHA256 use HMAC SHA 256
[1] as the MAC algorithm.
The PRF is the TLS PRF [8] with SHA 256 [13] as the hash function.
The cipher suites ending with  SHA384 use HMAC SHA 384 [1] as the MAC algorithm.
The PRF is the TLS PRF [8] with SHA 384 [13] as the hash function.
When used with TLS versions prior to 1.2 (TLS 1.0 [2] and TLS 1.1 [6]), the PRF is calculated as specified in the appropriate version of the TLS specification.
PSK cipher suites for TLS are described in RFC 5487 [11] as to SHA  256/384 and RFC 5489
[12] as to ECDHE PSK.
At the time of writing this document, there are no known weak keys for Camellia.
Additionally, no security problems with Camellia have been found (see NESSIE [16], CRYPTREC [17], and LNCS 5867[18]).
The security considerations in previous RFCs (RFC 5116 [7], RFC 5289 [10], and RFC 5487 [11]) apply to this document as well.
IANA Considerations IANA allocated the following numbers in the TLS Cipher Suite Registry:
CipherSuite TLS ECDHE ECDSA WITH CAMELLIA 128
; CipherSuite TLS ECDH ECDSA WITH CAMELLIA 128 GCM
CipherSuite TLS DHE PSK WITH CAMELLIA 128
CipherSuite TLS DHE PSK WITH CAMELLIA 256
; CipherSuite TLS RSA PSK WITH CAMELLIA 256
