1.  Introduction A management system contains:
several (potentially many) nodes, each with a processing entity, termed an agent, which has access to management instrumentation; at least one management station; and, a management protocol, used to convey management information between the agents and management stations.
Operations of the protocol are carried out under an administrative framework which defines authentication, authorization, access control, and privacy policies.
Management stations execute management applications which monitor and control managed elements.
Managed elements are devices such as hosts, routers, terminal servers, etc., which are monitored and controlled via access to their management information.
Management information is viewed as a collection of managed objects, residing in a virtual information store, termed the Management Information Base (MIB).
Collections of related objects are defined in MIB modules.
These modules are written using a subset of OSI's Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1) [1], termed the Structure of Management Information (SMI)
This document is the MIB module which defines managed objects for managing implementations of the User Datagram Protocol (UDP) [3].
The managed objects in this MIB module were originally defined using the SNMPv1 framework as a part of MIB II [4].
This document defines the same objects for UDP using the SNMPv2 framework.

kzm@cisco.com" DESCRIPTION "The MIB module for managing UDP implementations.
The initial revision of this MIB module was part of MIB  II."
"The total number of UDP datagrams delivered to UDP users."
"The total number of received UDP datagrams for which there was no application at the destination port."
SEQUENCE OF UdpEntry MAX ACCESS
A table containing UDP listener information."
current DESCRIPTION "Information about a particular current UDP listener.
The local IP address for this UDP listener.
In the case of a UDP listener which is willing to accept datagrams for any IP interface associated with the node, the value 0.0.0.0 is used."
"The local port number for this UDP listener."
MODULE COMPLIANCE STATUS  current DESCRIPTION
"The compliance statement for SNMPv2 entities which implement UDP."
{ udpInDatagrams, udpNoPorts, udpInErrors, udpOutDatagrams,
udpLocalAddress, udpLocalPort } STATUS    current DESCRIPTION "
The udp group of objects providing for management of UDP entities."
