- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   This document specifies the IANA guidelines [RFC5226] for\
    \ allocating\n   new values for the Routing Type field in the IPv6 Routing Header\n\
    \   [RFC2460].  Previously, no IANA guidance existed for such\n   allocations.\n"
- title: 2.  IANA Considerations
  contents:
  - "2.  IANA Considerations\n   New Routing Type values are allocated through IETF\
    \ Review or IESG\n   Approval [RFC5226].\n   Note that two experimental values\
    \ (253 and 254) are already available\n   for use [RFC4727].\n"
- title: 3.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "3.  Security Considerations\n   This specification does not change the security\
    \ properties of the\n   Routing Header.  However, past experience shows that it\
    \ is easy to\n   design routing headers that have significant problems [RFC5095].\n"
