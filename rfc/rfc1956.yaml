  - "Introduction\n   This RFC describes the policy for the registration of second\
    \ level\n   domains under the \".MIL\" domain.\n"
- title: Policy
  contents:
  - "Policy\n   A.  The \".MIL\" domain is delegated from the root authority to the\
    \ US\n   Department of Defense (DoD).  Only US military services, unified or\n\
    \   specified commands, and operating agencies of the DoD which do not\n   report\
    \ through military service chains can be registered as a second\n   level domain\
    \ under the \".MIL\" domain.  All other DoD organizations\n   will register through\
    \ their respective second level domain\n   administrators using the registration\
    \ procedures established by those\n   offices.  The \".MIL\" domain is administered\
    \ by the DoD Network\n   Information Center (NIC).\n   B.  The domain names under\
    \ the \".MIL\" will be descriptive of the\n   organization they will service.\
    \  The domain name length is preferred\n   to be 12 characters or less, and must\
    \ be unique (first come first\n   serve if duplicates occur).\n   C.  Each second\
    \ level domain under the \".MIL\" domain will be\n   supported by at least two\
    \ name servers.  Preferably these servers\n   will be located in two separate\
    \ networks.  All DNS servers supporting\n   subdomains of the \".MIL\" domain\
    \ must be in the \".MIL\" domain.\n   D.  Prospective second level domain administrators\
    \ in the \".MIL\"\n   domain will request registration using the template provided\
    \ by the\n   DoD NIC.  The templates are available via anonymous FTP or\n   interactively\
    \ via the DoD NIC World Wide Web Homepage.  The domain\n   request template shall\
    \ be submitted to the DoD NIC hostmaster\n   (hostmaster@nic.ddn.mil).  The DoD\
    \ NIC hostmaster will only accept\n   domain registration templates from registered\
    \ \".MIL\" users.\n"
