  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   Throughout its history, the Internet has employed a central\
    \ Internet\n   Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) responsible for the allocation\
    \ and\n   assignment of various identifiers needed for the operation of the\n\
    \   Internet [RFC1174].  In the case of the IPv4 address space, the IANA\n   allocates\
    \ parts of the address space to Regional Internet Registries\n   (RIRs) according\
    \ to their established needs.  These RIRs are\n   responsible for the registration\
    \ of IPv4 addresses to operators and\n   users of the Internet within their regions.\n\
    \   On an ongoing basis, the IANA has been designated by the IETF to make\n  \
    \ assignments in support of the Internet Standards Process [RFC2860].\n   Section\
    \ 4 of that document describes that assignment process.\n   Small portions of\
    \ the IPv4 address space have been allocated or\n   assigned directly by the IANA\
    \ for global or other specialized\n   purposes.  These allocations and assignments\
    \ have been documented in\n   a variety of RFCs and other documents.  This document\
    \ is intended to\n   collect these scattered references and provide a current\
    \ list of\n   special use IPv4 addresses.\n   This document is a revision of RFC\
    \ 3330 [RFC3330], which it\n   obsoletes; its primary purpose is to reflect the\
    \ changes to the list\n   of special IPv4 assignments since the publication of\
    \ RFC 3330.  It is\n   a companion to [RFC5156], which describes special IPv6\
    \ addresses.\n"

- title: 3.  Global and Other Specialized Address Blocks
  contents:
  - "3.  Global and Other Specialized Address Blocks\n   0.0.0.0/8 - Addresses in\
    \ this block refer to source hosts on \"this\"\n   network.  Address 0.0.0.0/32\
    \ may be used as a source address for this\n   host on this network; other addresses\
    \ within 0.0.0.0/8 may be used to\n   refer to specified hosts on this network\
    \ ([RFC1122], Section\n   3.2.1.3).\n   10.0.0.0/8 - This block is set aside for\
    \ use in private networks.\n   Its intended use is documented in [RFC1918].  As\
    \ described in that\n   RFC, addresses within this block do not legitimately appear\
    \ on the\n   public Internet.  These addresses can be used without any\n   coordination\
    \ with IANA or an Internet registry.\n   127.0.0.0/8 - This block is assigned\
    \ for use as the Internet host\n   loopback address.  A datagram sent by a higher-level\
    \ protocol to an\n   address anywhere within this block loops back inside the\
    \ host.  This\n   is ordinarily implemented using only 127.0.0.1/32 for loopback.\
    \  As\n   described in [RFC1122], Section 3.2.1.3, addresses within the entire\n\
    \   127.0.0.0/8 block do not legitimately appear on any network anywhere.\n  \
    \ 169.254.0.0/16 - This is the \"link local\" block.  As described in\n   [RFC3927],\
    \ it is allocated for communication between hosts on a\n   single link.  Hosts\
    \ obtain these addresses by auto-configuration,\n   such as when a DHCP server\
    \ cannot be found.\n   172.16.0.0/12 - This block is set aside for use in private\
    \ networks.\n   Its intended use is documented in [RFC1918].  As described in\
    \ that\n   RFC, addresses within this block do not legitimately appear on the\n\
    \   public Internet.  These addresses can be used without any\n   coordination\
    \ with IANA or an Internet registry.\n   192.0.0.0/24 - This block is reserved\
    \ for IETF protocol assignments.\n   At the time of writing this document, there\
    \ are no current\n   assignments.  Allocation policy for future assignments is\
    \ given in\n   [RFC5736].\n   192.0.2.0/24 - This block is assigned as \"TEST-NET-1\"\
    \ for use in\n   documentation and example code.  It is often used in conjunction\
    \ with\n   domain names example.com or example.net in vendor and protocol\n  \
    \ documentation.  As described in [RFC5737], addresses within this\n   block do\
    \ not legitimately appear on the public Internet and can be\n   used without any\
    \ coordination with IANA or an Internet registry.  See\n   [RFC1166].\n   192.88.99.0/24\
    \ - This block is allocated for use as 6to4 relay\n   anycast addresses, in [RFC3068].\
    \  In contrast with previously\n   described blocks, packets destined to addresses\
    \ from this block do\n   appear in the public Internet.  [RFC3068], Section 7,\
    \ describes\n   operational practices to prevent the malicious use of this block\
    \ in\n   routing protocols.\n   192.168.0.0/16 - This block is set aside for use\
    \ in private networks.\n   Its intended use is documented in [RFC1918].  As described\
    \ in that\n   RFC, addresses within this block do not legitimately appear on the\n\
    \   public Internet.  These addresses can be used without any\n   coordination\
    \ with IANA or an Internet registry.\n   198.18.0.0/15 - This block has been allocated\
    \ for use in benchmark\n   tests of network interconnect devices.  [RFC2544] explains\
    \ that this\n   range was assigned to minimize the chance of conflict in case\
    \ a\n   testing device were to be accidentally connected to part of the\n   Internet.\
    \  Packets with source addresses from this range are not\n   meant to be forwarded\
    \ across the Internet.\n   198.51.100.0/24 - This block is assigned as \"TEST-NET-2\"\
    \ for use in\n   documentation and example code.  It is often used in conjunction\
    \ with\n   domain names example.com or example.net in vendor and protocol\n  \
    \ documentation.  As described in [RFC5737], addresses within this\n   block do\
    \ not legitimately appear on the public Internet and can be\n   used without any\
    \ coordination with IANA or an Internet registry.\n   203.0.113.0/24 - This block\
    \ is assigned as \"TEST-NET-3\" for use in\n   documentation and example code.\
    \  It is often used in conjunction with\n   domain names example.com or example.net\
    \ in vendor and protocol\n   documentation.  As described in [RFC5737], addresses\
    \ within this\n   block do not legitimately appear on the public Internet and\
    \ can be\n   used without any coordination with IANA or an Internet registry.\n\
    \   224.0.0.0/4 - This block, formerly known as the Class D address\n   space,\
    \ is allocated for use in IPv4 multicast address assignments.\n   The IANA guidelines\
    \ for assignments from this space are described in\n   [RFC3171].\n   240.0.0.0/4\
    \ - This block, formerly known as the Class E address\n   space, is reserved for\
    \ future use; see [RFC1112], Section 4.\n   The one exception to this is the \"\
    limited broadcast\" destination\n   address 255.255.255.255.  As described in\
    \ [RFC0919] and [RFC0922],\n   packets with this destination address are not forwarded\
    \ at the IP\n   layer.\n"

  - "5.  Assignments of IPv4 Blocks for New Specialized Uses\n   The IANA has responsibility\
    \ for making assignments of protocol\n   parameters used in the Internet according\
    \ to the requirements of the\n   \"Memorandum of Understanding Concerning the\
    \ Technical Work of the\n   Internet Assigned Numbers Authority\" [RFC2860]. \
    \ Among other things,\n   [RFC2860] requires that protocol parameters be assigned\
    \ according to\n   the criteria and procedures specified in RFCs, including Proposed,\n\
    \   Draft, and full Internet Standards and Best Current Practice\n   documents,\
    \ and any other RFC that calls for IANA assignment.\n   The domain name and IP\
    \ address spaces involve policy issues (in\n   addition to technical issues) so\
    \ that the requirements of [RFC2860]\n   do not apply generally to those spaces.\
    \  Nonetheless, the IANA is\n   responsible for ensuring assignments of IPv4 addresses\
    \ as needed in\n   support of the Internet Standards Process.  When a portion\
    \ of the\n   IPv4 address space is specifically required by an RFC, the technical\n\
    \   requirements (e.g., size, prefix length) for the portion should be\n   described\

    \ notify the RFC Editor of the\n   particulars for inclusion in the RFC as published.\n\
    \   As required by [RFC2860], the IANA will also make necessary\n   experimental\

    \   a private address space such as the 10.0.0.0/8 block or the link\n   local\
    \ block 169.254.0.0/16 originate within your subnet, all routers\n   at the border\
    \ of your network should filter such packets that\n   originate from outside your\
    \ network.  Attacks have been mounted that\n   depend on the unexpected use of\
    \ some of these addresses.\n   It should also be noted that some of these address\
    \ spaces may be used\n   legitimately outside a single administrative domain,\
    \ and may appear\n   on the global Internet.  Security policy SHOULD NOT blindly\
    \ filter\n   all of these address spaces without due consideration, and network\n\
    \   operators are encouraged to review this document, and references\n   contained\
