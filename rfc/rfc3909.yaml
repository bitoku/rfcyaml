  contents:
  - "Abstract\n   This specification describes a Lightweight Directory Access Protocol\n\
    \   (LDAP) extended operation to cancel (or abandon) an outstanding\n   operation.\
    \  Unlike the LDAP Abandon operation, but like the X.511\n   Directory Access\
    \ Protocol (DAP) Abandon operation, this operation has\n   a response which provides\
    \ an indication of its outcome.\n"
- title: 1.  Background and Intent of Use
  contents:
  - "1.  Background and Intent of Use\n   The Lightweight Directory Access Protocol\
    \ (LDAP) [RFC3377] provides\n   an Abandon operation [RFC2251] which clients may\
    \ use to cancel other\n   operations.  The Abandon operation does not have a response\
    \ and\n   requires no response from the abandoned operation.  These semantics\n\
    \   provide the client with no clear indication of the outcome of the\n   Abandon\
    \ operation.\n   The X.511 Directory Access Protocol (DAP) [X.511] provides an\
    \ Abandon\n   operation which has a response and also requires the abandoned\n\
    \   operation to return a response indicating it was canceled.  The LDAP\n   Cancel\
    \ operation is modeled after the DAP Abandon operation.\n   The LDAP Cancel operation\
    \ SHOULD be used instead of the LDAP Abandon\n   operation when the client needs\
    \ an indication of the outcome.  This\n   operation may be used to cancel both\
    \ interrogation and update\n   operations.\n   Protocol elements are described\
    \ using ASN.1 [X.680] with implicit\n   tags.  The term \"BER-encoded\" means\
    \ the element is to be encoded\n   using the Basic Encoding Rules [X.690] under\
    \ the restrictions\n   detailed in Section 5.1 of [RFC2251].\n   DSA stands for\
    \ Directory System Agent (or server).\n   DSE stands for DSA-specific Entry.\n\
    \   The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\"\
    ,\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in\
    \ this\n   document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14 [RFC2119].\n"

  contents:
  - "2.  Cancel Operation\n   The Cancel operation is defined as an LDAP Extended\
    \ Operation\n   [RFC2251, Section 4.12] identified by the object identifier\n\
    \   1.3.6.1.1.8.  This section details the syntax of the Cancel request\n   and\
    \ response messages and defines additional LDAP resultCodes.\n"
- title: 2.1.  Cancel Request
  contents:
  - "2.1.  Cancel Request\n   The Cancel request is an ExtendedRequest with the requestName\

    \ cannotCancel    (121)\n"
- title: 3.  Operational Semantics
  contents:
  - "3.  Operational Semantics\n   The function of the Cancel Operation is to request\
    \ that the server\n   cancel an outstanding operation issued within the same session.\n\
    \   The client requests the cancelation of an outstanding operation by\n   issuing\
    \ a Cancel Response with a cancelID set to the message ID of\n   the outstanding\
    \ operation.  The Cancel Request itself has a distinct\n   message ID.  Clients\
    \ SHOULD NOT request the cancelation of an\n   operation multiple times.\n   If\
    \ the server is willing and able to cancel the outstanding operation\n   identified\
    \ by the cancelId, the server SHALL return a Cancel Response\n   with a success\
    \ resultCode, and the canceled operation SHALL fail with\n   canceled resultCode.\
    \  Otherwise the Cancel Response SHALL have a\n   non-success resultCode and SHALL\
    \ NOT have an impact upon the\n   outstanding operation (if it exists).\n   The\
    \ protocolError resultCode is returned if the server is unable to\n   parse the\
    \ requestValue or the requestValue is absent,\n   The noSuchOperation resultCode\
    \ is returned if the server has no\n   knowledge of the operation requested for\
    \ cancelation.\n   The cannotCancel resultCode is returned if the identified operation\n\
    \   does not support cancelation or the cancel operation could not be\n   performed.\
    \  The following classes of operations are not cancelable:\n   -  operations which\
    \ have no response,\n   -  operations which create, alter, or destroy authentication\
    \ and/or\n      authorization associations,\n   -  operations which establish,\
    \ alter, or tear-down security services,\n      and\n   -  operations which abandon\
    \ or cancel other operations.\n   Specifically, the Abandon, Bind, Start TLS [RFC2830],\
    \ Unbind, and\n   Cancel operations are not cancelable.\n   The Cancel operation\
    \ cannot be abandoned.\n   The tooLate resultCode is returned to indicate that\
    \ it is too late to\n   cancel the outstanding operation.  For example, the server\
    \ may return\n   tooLate for a request to cancel an outstanding modify operation\
    \ which\n   has already committed updates to the underlying data store.\n   Servers\
    \ SHOULD indicate their support for this extended operation by\n   providing 1.3.6.1.1.8\
    \ as a value of the 'supportedExtension'\n   attribute type in their root DSE.\
    \  A server MAY choose to advertise\n   this extension only when the client is\
    \ authorized to use it.\n"
- title: 4.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "4.  Security Considerations\n   This operation is intended to allow a user to\
    \ cancel operations they\n   previously issued during the current LDAP association.\
    \  In certain\n   cases, such as when the Proxy Authorization Control is in use,\n\
    \   different outstanding operations may be processed under different\n   LDAP\
    \ associations.  Servers MUST NOT allow a user to cancel an\n   operation belonging\
    \ to another user.\n   Some operations should not be cancelable for security reasons.\
    \  This\n   specification disallows the cancelation of the Bind operation and\n\
    \   Start TLS extended operation so as to avoid adding complexity to\n   authentication,\
    \ authorization, and security layer semantics.\n   Designers of future extended\
    \ operations and/or controls should\n   disallow abandonment and cancelation when\
    \ appropriate.\n"
