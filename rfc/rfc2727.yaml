  - "1.  Introduction\n   This document is a revision of and supercedes RFC2282. \
    \ It is a\n   complete specification of the process by which members of the IAB\
    \ and\n   IESG are selected, confirmed, and recalled as of the date of its\n \
    \  approval.  However, these procedures are subject to change and such\n   change\
    \ takes effect immediately upon its approval, regardless of\n   whether this document\
    \ has yet been revised.\n   The following two assumptions continue to be true\
    \ of this\n   specification.\n   (1)  The Internet Research Task Force (IRTF)\
    \ and Internet Research\n        Steering Group (IRSG) are not a part of the process\
    \ described\n        here.\n   (2)  The organization (and re-organization) of\
    \ the IESG is not a part\n        of the process described here.\n   The time\
    \ frames specified here use IETF meetings as a frame of\n   reference.  The time\
    \ frames assume that the IETF meets at least once\n   per calendar year.  This\
    \ document specifies time frames relative to\n   the first IETF of the calendar\
    \ year, or simply \"First IETF\".\n   The remainder of this document is divided\
    \ into four major topics as\n   follows.\n   General This a set of rules and constraints\
    \ that apply to the\n        selection and confirmation process as a whole.\n\
    \   Nominating Committee Selection This is the process by which\n        volunteers\
    \ from the IETF community are recognized to serve on\n        the committee that\
    \ nominates candidates to serve on the IESG and\n        IAB.\n   Nominating Committee\
    \ Operation This is the set of principles, rules,\n        and constraints that\
    \ guide the activities of the nominating\n        committee, including the confirmation\
    \ process.\n   Member Recall This is the process by which the behavior of a sitting\n\
    \        member of the IESG or IAB may be questioned, perhaps resulting\n    \
    \    in the removal of the sitting member.\n   A final section describes how this\
    \ document differs from its\n   predecessor: RFC2282.\n"

  contents:
  - "2.  General\n   The following set of rules apply to the selection and confirmation\n\
    \   process as a whole.  If necessary, a paragraph discussing the\n   interpretation\
    \ of each rule is included.\n   (1)  The principal functions of the nominating\
    \ committee are to\n        review the open IESG and IAB positions and to either\
    \ nominate\n        its incumbent or recruit a superior candidate.\n      The\
    \ nominating committee does not select the open positions to be\n      reviewed;\
    \ it is instructed as to which positions to review.\n      At a minimum, the nominating\
    \ committee will be given the title of\n      the position to be reviewed.  The\
    \ nominating committee may be\n      given a desirable set of qualifications for\
    \ the candidate\n      nominated to fill each position.\n      Incumbents must\
    \ notify the nominating committee if they do not\n      wish to be nominated.\n\
    \      The nominating committee does not confirm its candidates; it\n      presents\
    \ its candidates to the appropriate confirming body as\n      indicated below.\n\
    \   (2)  The annual selection and confirmation process is expected to be\n   \
    \     completed within 3 months.\n      The annual selection and confirmation\
    \ process is expected to be\n      completed one month prior to the friday of\
    \ the week before the\n      First IETF.  It is expected to begin 4 months prior\
    \ to the Friday\n      of the week before the First IETF.\n   (3)  One-half of\
    \ each of the then current IESG and IAB positions is\n        selected to be reviewed\
    \ each year.\n      The intent of this rule to ensure the review of approximately\n\
    \      one-half of each of the sitting IESG and IAB members each year.\n     \
    \ It is recognized that circumstances may exist that will require\n      the nominating\
    \ committee to review more or less than one-half of\n      the current positions,\
    \ e.g., if the IESG or IAB have re-organized\n      prior to this process and\
    \ created new positions, or if there are\n      an odd number of current positions.\n\
    \   (4)  Confirmed candidates are expected to serve at least a 2 year\n      \
    \  term.\n      The intent of this rule is to ensure that members of the IESG\
    \ and\n      IAB serve the number of years that best facilitates the review of\n\
    \      one-half of the members each year.\n      It is consistent with this rule\
    \ for the nominating committee to\n      choose one or more of the currently open\
    \ positions to which it may\n      assign a term greater than 2 years in order\
    \ to ensure the ideal\n      application of this rule in the future.\n      It\
    \ is consistent with this rule for the nominating committee to\n      choose one\
    \ or more of the currently open positions that share\n      responsibilities with\
    \ other positions (both those being reviewed\n      and those sitting) to which\
    \ it may assign a term greater than 2\n      years to ensure that all such members\
    \ will not be reviewed at the\n      same time.\n      All sitting member terms\
    \ end during the First IETF meeting\n      corresponding to the end of the term\
    \ for which they were\n      confirmed.  All confirmed candidate terms begin during\
    \ the First\n      IETF meeting corresponding to the beginning of the term for\
    \ which\n      they were confirmed.  Normally, the confirmed candidate's term\n\
    \      begins when the currently sitting member's term ends on the last\n    \
    \  day of the meeting.  A term may begin or end no sooner than the\n      first\
    \ day of the meeting and no later than the last day of the\n      meeting as determined\
    \ by the mutual agreement of the currently\n      sitting member and the confirmed\
    \ candidate.  The confirmed\n      candidate's term may overlap the sitting member's\
    \ term during the\n      meeting as determined by their mutual agreement.\n  \
    \ (5)  Mid-term vacancies are filled by the same rules as documented\n       \
    \ here with four qualifications.  First, the most recently\n        constituted\
    \ nominating committee is reconvened to nominate a\n        candidate to fill\
    \ the vacancy.  Second, the selection and\n        confirmation process is expected\
    \ to be completed within 1 month,\n        with all other time periods otherwise\
    \ unspecified prorated\n        accordingly.  Third, the confirming body has two\
    \ weeks from the\n        day it is notified of a candidate to reject the candidate,\n\
    \        otherwise the candidate is assumed to have been confirmed.\n        Fourth,\
    \ the term of the confirmed candidate will be either:\n   a. the remainder of\
    \ the term of the open position if that remainder\n      is not less than one\
    \ year.\n   b. the remainder of the term of the open position plus the next 2\n\
    \      year term if that remainder is less than one year.\n   (6)  All deliberations\
    \ and supporting information that relates to\n        specific nominees, candidates,\
    \ and confirmed candidates are\n        confidential.\n      The nominating committee\
    \ and confirming body members will be\n      exposed to confidential information\
    \ as a result of their\n      deliberations, their interactions with those they\
    \ consult, and\n      from those who provide requested supporting information.\
    \  All\n      members and all other participants are expected to handle this\n\
    \      information in a manner consistent with its sensitivity.\n      It is consistent\
    \ with this rule for current nominating committee\n      members who have served\
    \ on prior nominating committees to advise\n      the current committee on deliberations\
    \ and results of the prior\n      committee, as necessary and appropriate.\n \
    \  (7)  Unless otherwise specified, the advise and consent model is used\n   \
    \     throughout the process.  This model is characterized as follows.\n   a.\
    \ The IETF Executive Director advises the nominating committee of\n      the IESG\
    \ and IAB positions to be reviewed.\n   b. The nominating committee selects candidates\
    \ and advises the\n      confirming bodies of them.\n   c. The sitting IAB members\
    \ review the IESG candidates, consenting to\n      some, all, or none.\n     \
    \ If all of the candidates are confirmed, the job of the nominating\n      committee\
    \ with respect to reviewing the open IESG positions is\n      considered complete.\
    \  If some or none of the candidates are\n      confirmed, the nominating committee\
    \ must reconvene to select\n      alternate candidates for the rejected candidates.\
    \  Any additional\n      time required by the nominating committee should not\
    \ exceed its\n      maximum time allotment.\n   d. The Internet Society Board\
    \ of Trustees reviews the IAB candidates,\n      consenting to some, all, or none.\n\
    \      If all of the candidates are confirmed, the job of the nominating\n   \
    \   committee with respect to reviewing the open IAB positions is\n      considered\
    \ complete.  If some or none of the candidates are\n      confirmed, the nominating\
    \ committee must reconvene to select\n      alternate candidates for the rejected\
    \ candidates.  Any additional\n      time required by the nominating committee\
    \ should not exceed its\n      maximum time allotment.\n   e. The confirming bodies\
    \ decide their consent according to a\n      mechanism of their own choosing,\
    \ which must ensure that at least\n      one-half of the sitting members agree\
    \ with the decision.\n      At least one-half of the sitting members of the confirming\
    \ bodies\n      must agree to either confirm or reject each individual nominee.\n\
    \      The agreement must be decided within a reasonable timeframe.  The\n   \
    \   agreement may be decided by conducting a formal vote, by asserting\n     \
    \ consensus based on informal exchanges (email), or by whatever\n      mechanism\
    \ is used to conduct the normal business of the confirming\n      body.\n"

  - "3.  Nominating Committee Selection\n   The following set of rules apply to the\
    \ creation of the nominating\n   committee and the selection of its members.\n\
    \   (1)  The committee comprises at least a non-voting Chair, 10 voting\n    \
    \    volunteers, and 3 non-voting liaisons.\n      Any committee member may propose\
    \ the addition of a non-voting\n      advisor to participate in some or all of\
    \ the deliberations of the\n      committee.  The addition must be approved by\
    \ both the voting and\n      non-voting members of the committee according to\
    \ its established\n      voting mechanism.  Advisors participate as individuals.\n\
    \      Any committee member may propose the addition of a non-voting\n      liaison\
    \ from other unrepresented organizations to participate in\n      some or all\
    \ of the deliberations of the committee.  The addition\n      must be approved\
    \ by both the voting and non-voting members of the\n      committee according\
    \ to its established voting mechanism.  Liaisons\n      participate as representatives\
    \ of their respective organizations.\n      Advisors and liaisons must meet the\
    \ usual requirements for\n      membership in the nominating committee.  In the\
    \ case of liaisons\n      the requirements apply to the organization not to the\
    \ individual.\n   (2)  The Internet Society President appoints the non-voting\
    \ Chair,\n        who must meet the usual requirements for membership in the\n\
    \        nominating committee.\n      The nominating committee Chair must agree\
    \ to invest the time\n      necessary to ensure that the nominating committee\
    \ completes its\n      assigned duties and to perform in the best interests of\
    \ the IETF\n      community in that role.\n   (3)  The Chair obtains the list\
    \ of IESG and IAB positions to be\n        reviewed and publishes it along with\
    \ a solicitation for names of\n        volunteers from the IETF community willing\
    \ to serve on the\n        nominating committee.\n      The list of open positions\
    \ is published with the solicitation to\n      facilitate community members choosing\
    \ between volunteering for an\n      open position and volunteering for the nominating\
    \ committee.\n      The list and solicitation must be publicized using at least\
    \ the\n      same mechanism used by the IETF secretariat for its announcements.\n\
    \   (4)  Members of the IETF community must have attended at least 2 of\n    \
    \    the last 3 IETF meetings in order to volunteer.\n   (5)  Internet Society\
    \ Board of Trustees, sitting members of the IAB,\n        and sitting members\
    \ of the IESG may not volunteer.\n   (6)  The Chair announces the pool of volunteers\
    \ from which the 10\n        voting volunteers will be randomly selected.\n  \
    \    The announcement must be made using at least the same mechanism\n      used\
    \ by the IETF secretariat for its announcements.\n   (7)  The Chair randomly selects\
    \ the 10 voting volunteers from the\n        pool of names of volunteers using\
    \ a method that can be\n        independently verified to be unbiased and fair.\n\
    \      A method is fair if each eligible volunteer is equally likely to\n    \
    \  be selected.  A method is unbiased if no one can influence its\n      outcome\
    \ in favor of a specific outcome.\n      The method must include an announcement\
    \ of an enumerated list of\n      the pool of names together with the specific\
    \ algorithm for how\n      names will be chosen from the list.  The output of\
    \ the selection\n      algorithm must depend on random data whose value is not\
    \ known at\n      the time the list and algorithm are announced.\n      One possible\
    \ method is described in [1].\n      All announcements must be made using at least\
    \ the mechanism used\n      by the IETF secretariat for its announcements.\n \
    \  (8)  The sitting IAB and IESG members each appoint a non-voting\n        liaison\
    \ to the nominating committee from their current\n        membership who are not\
    \ sitting in an open position.\n   (9)  The Chair of the prior year's nominating\
    \ committee serves as a\n        non-voting liaison.\n      The prior year's Chair\
    \ may select a designee from a pool composed\n      of the voting members of the\
    \ prior year's committee and all prior\n      Chairs if the Chair is unavailable.\
    \  If the prior year's Chair is\n      unavailable and is unable or unwilling\
    \ to make such a designation\n      in a timely fashion, the Chair of the current\
    \ committee may do so.\n      Selecting a prior year's committee member as the\
    \ designee permits\n      the experience of the prior year's deliberations to\
    \ be readily\n      available to the current committee.  Selecting an earlier\
    \ prior\n      year Chair as the designee permits the experience of being a Chair\n\
    \      as well as that Chair's committee deliberations to be readily\n      available\
    \ to the current committee.\n"
- title: 4.  Nominating Committee Operation
  contents:
  - "4.  Nominating Committee Operation\n   The following rules apply to the operation\
    \ of the nominating\n   committee.  If necessary, a paragraph discussing the interpretation\n\
    \   of each rule is included.\n   The rules are organized approximately in the\
    \ order in which they\n   would be invoked.\n   The term nominee refers to an\
    \ individual under consideration by the\n   nominating committee.  The term candidate\
    \ refers to a nominee that\n   has been selected by the nominating committee to\
    \ be considered for\n   confirmation by a confirming body.  A confirmed candidate\
    \ is a\n   candidate that has been reviewed and approved by a confirming body.\n\
    \   (1)  All rules and special circumstances not otherwise specified are\n   \
    \     at the discretion of the committee.\n      Exceptional circumstances will\
    \ occasionally arise during the\n      normal operation of the nominating committee.\
    \  This rule is\n      intended to foster the continued forward progress of the\n\
    \      committee.\n      Any member of the committee may propose a rule for adoption\
    \ by the\n      committee.  The rule must be approved by both the voting and non-\n\
    \      voting members of the committee according to its established\n      voting\
    \ mechanism.\n      All members of the committee should consider whether the exception\n\
    \      is worthy of mention in the next revision of this document and\n      followup\
    \ accordingly.\n   (2)  The Chair must establish and publicize milestones, which\
    \ must\n        include at least a call for nominations.\n      There is a defined\
    \ time period during which the selection and\n      confirmation process must\
    \ be completed.  The Chair must establish\n      a set of milestones which, if\
    \ met in a timely fashion, will result\n      in the completion of the process\
    \ on time.  The Chair should allow\n      time for iterating the activities of\
    \ the committee if one or more\n      candidates is not confirmed.\n      The\
    \ milestones must be publicized using at least the same\n      mechanism used\
    \ by the IETF secretariat for its announcements.\n   (3)  The Chair must establish\
    \ a voting mechanism.\n      The committee must be able to objectively determine\
    \ when a\n      decision has been made during its deliberations.  The criteria\
    \ for\n      determining closure must be established and known to all members\n\
    \      of the nominating committee.\n   (4)  At least a quorum of committee members\
    \ must participate in a\n        vote.  A quorum comprises at least 7 voting members.\n\
    \   (5)  The Chair may establish a process by which a member of the\n        nominating\
    \ committee may be recalled.\n      The process, if established, must be agreed\
    \ to by a 3/4 majority\n      of the members of the nominating committee, including\
    \ the non-\n      voting members since they would be subject to the same process.\n\
    \   (6)  All members of the nominating committee may participate in all\n    \
    \    deliberations.\n      The emphasis of this rule is that no member, whether\
    \ voting or\n      non-voting, can be explicitly excluded from any deliberation.\n\
    \      However, a member may individually choose not to participate in a\n   \
    \   deliberation.\n   (7)  The Chair announces the open positions to be reviewed\
    \ and the\n        call for nominees.\n      The call for nominees must include\
    \ a request for comments\n      regarding the past performance of incumbents,\
    \ which will be\n      considered during the deliberations of the nominating committee.\n\
    \      The announcements must be publicized using at least the same\n      mechanism\
    \ used by the IETF secretariat for its announcements.\n   (8)  Any member of the\
    \ IETF community may nominate any member of the\n        IETF community for any\
    \ open position.\n      A self-nomination is permitted.\n   (9)  Nominating committee\
    \ members must not be nominees.\n      To be a nominee is to enter the process\
    \ of being selected as a\n      candidate and confirmed.  Nominating committee\
    \ members are not\n      eligible to be considered for filling any open position.\
    \  They\n      become ineligible as soon as their role is announced to the IETF\n\
    \      community and they remain ineligible for the duration of this\n      nominating\
    \ committee's term.\n   (10) Members of the IETF community who were recalled from\
    \ any IESG or\n        IAB position during the previous two years must not be\
    \ nominees.\n   (11) The nominating committee selects candidates based on its\n\
    \        understanding of the IETF community's consensus of the\n        qualifications\
    \ required to fill the open positions.\n      The intent of this rule is to ensure\
    \ that the nominating committee\n      consults with a broad base of the IETF\
    \ community for input to its\n      deliberations.\n      The consultations are\
    \ permitted to include a slate of nominees, if\n      all parties to the consultation\
    \ agree to observe customary and\n      reasonable rules of confidentiality.\n\
    \      A broad base of the community should include the existing members\n   \
    \   of the IAB and IESG, especially sitting members who share\n      responsibilities\
    \ with open positions, e.g., co-Area Directors.\n   (12) Nominees should be advised\
    \ that they are being considered and\n        must consent to their nomination\
    \ prior to being confirmed.\n      The nominating committee should help nominees\
    \ provide\n      justification to their employers.\n      A nominee's consent\
    \ must be written (email is acceptable) and\n      include a commitment to provide\
    \ the resources necessary to fill\n      the open position and an assurance that\
    \ the nominee will perform\n      the duties of the position for which they are\
    \ being considered in\n      the best interests of the IETF community.\n   (13)\
    \ The nominating committee advises the confirming bodies of their\n        candidates,\
    \ specifying a single candidate for each open position\n        and a testament\
    \ as to how each candidate meets the\n        qualifications of an open position.\n\
    \      The testament may include a brief resume of the candidate and a\n     \
    \ summary of the deliberations of the nominating committee.\n   (14) With respect\
    \ to any action to be taken in the context of\n        notifying and announcing\
    \ confirmed candidates, and notifying\n        rejected nominees and candidates,\
    \ the action must be valid\n        according to all of the rules specified below\
    \ prior to its\n        execution.\n   a. Up until a candidate is confirmed, the\
    \ identity of the candidate\n      must be kept confidential.\n   b. The identity\
    \ of all nominees must be kept confidential (except\n      that the nominee may\

    \ to be rejected\n      early in the process and for some nominees to be kept\
    \ as\n      alternates in case a candidate is rejected by a confirming body.\n\
    \      In the matter of whether a confirmed candidate was a first choice\n   \
    \   or an alternate, that information need not ever be disclosed and,\n      in\
    \ fact, probably never should be.\n      It is consistent with these rules for\
    \ confirmed candidates to be\n      notified and announced as quickly as possible\
    \ instead of requiring\n      all confirmed candidates to wait until all open\
    \ positions have\n      been reviewed.\n      When consulting with individual\
    \ members of the IETF community, if\n      all parties to the consultation agree\
    \ to observe customary and\n      reasonable rules of confidentiality the consultations\
    \ are\n      permitted to include a slate of nominees.\n      The announcements\
    \ must be publicized using at least the same\n      mechanism used by the IETF\
    \ secretariat for its announcements.\n"
- title: 5.  Member Recall
  contents:
  - "5.  Member Recall\n   The following rules apply to the recall process.  If necessary,\
    \ a\n   paragraph discussing the interpretation of each rule is included.\n  \
    \ (1)  Anyone may request the recall of any sitting IAB or IESG member,\n    \
    \    at any time, upon written (email is acceptable) request with\n        justification\
    \ to the Internet Society President.\n   (2)  Internet Society President shall\
    \ appoint a Recall Committee\n        Chair.\n      The Internet Society President\
    \ must not evaluate the recall\n      request.  It is explicitly the responsibility\
    \ of the IETF\n      community to evaluate the behavior of its leaders.\n   (3)\
    \  The recall committee is created according to the same rules as\n        is\
    \ the nominating committee with the qualifications that the\n        person being\
    \ investigated and the person requesting the recall\n        must not be a member\
    \ of the recall committee in any capacity.\n   (4)  The recall committee operates\
    \ according to the same rules as the\n        nominating committee with the qualification\
    \ that there is no\n        confirmation process.\n   (5)  The recall committee\
    \ investigates the circumstances of the\n        justification for the recall\
    \ and votes on its findings.\n      The investigation must include at least both\
    \ an opportunity for\n      the member being recalled to present a written statement\
    \ and\n      consultation with third parties.\n   (6)  A 3/4 majority of the members\
    \ who vote on the question is\n        required for a recall.\n   (7)  If a sitting\
    \ member is recalled the open position is to be\n      filled according to the\
    \ mid-term vacancy rules.\n"

  contents:
  - "6.  Changes From RFC2282\n   Editorial changes are not described here, only substantive\
    \ changes.\n   They are listed here in the order in which they appear in the\n\
    \   document.\n   (1)  The frame of reference for timeframes was changed from\
    \ the\n        seasonal \"Spring IETF\" reference to the less geographic and more\n\
    \        temporal \"First IETF\" reference.\n   (2)  The terms of the sitting\
    \ members and their respective confirmed\n        candidates is explicitly permitted\
    \ to overlap during the First\n        IETF as determined by their mutual agreement.\n\
    \   (3)  Nominating committee members who have served on prior committees\n  \
    \      are explicitly permitted to advise the current committee on the\n     \
    \   deliberations and results of the prior committee.\n   (4)  The role and opportunity\
    \ for additional advisors and liaisons to\n        the nominating committee was\
    \ clarified.\n   (5)  A reference to a documented and accepted fair and unbiased\n\
    \        mechanism for randomly selecting nominating committee members\n     \
    \   from the pool of volunteers was added.\n   (6)  The option for the prior year's\
    \ Chair to select a designee to\n        serve as liaison to the current year's\
    \ committee was clarified\n        to ensure the Chair selected a non-voting liaison\
    \ from a pool\n        composed of the prior year's voting members and all prior\n\
    \        committee Chairs.\n   (7)  The responsibility and authority for the activities\
    \ of the\n        nominating committee rests with the committee as a whole, not\n\
    \        with the Chair.  The operation of the committee was clarified to\n  \
    \      require changes in process and the handling of exceptions to be\n     \
    \   approved by the committee as a whole as opposed to being at the\n        discretion\
    \ of the Chair.\n   (8)  The rule that prevented nominating committee members\
    \ from being\n        eligible to be considered for any open position was clarified\
    \ to\n        explicitly state that the rule applies from the point in time\n\
    \        that the committee membership is announced through the entire\n     \
    \   term of the current committee.\n"

    \ fine work and oral tradition that became the\n   first version of this document.\
    \  Of course we can not overlook the\n   bug discovery burden that each of the\

    \ 1999 - Donald Eastlake\n   Of course the bulk of the credit goes to the members\
    \ of the POISSON\n   Working Group, previously the POISED Working Group.  The\
    \ prose here\n   would not be what it is were it not for the attentive and insightful\n\
