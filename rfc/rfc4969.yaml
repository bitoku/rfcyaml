- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   E.164 Number Mapping (ENUM) [1] uses the Domain Name System\
    \ (DNS) [2]\n   to refer from E.164 numbers [3] to Uniform Resource Identifiers\n\
    \   (URIs) [6].  The registration process for Enumservices is described\n   in\
    \ Section 3 of RFC 3761.\n   \"vCard\" [4] is a transport-independent data format\
    \ for the exchange\n   of information about an individual.  For the purpose of\
    \ this\n   document, the term \"vCard\" refers to a specific instance of this\
    \ data\n   format -- an \"electronic business card\". vCards are exchanged via\n\
    \   several protocols; most commonly, they are distributed as electronic\n   mail\
    \ attachments or published on web servers.  Most popular personal\n   information\
    \ manager applications are capable of reading and writing\n   vCards.\n   The\
    \ Enumservice specified in this document deals with the relation\n   between an\
    \ E.164 number and vCards.  An ENUM record using this\n   Enumservice identifies\
    \ a resource from where a vCard corresponding to\n   the respective E.164 number\
    \ could be fetched.\n   Clients could use those resources to, e.g., automatically\
    \ update\n   local address books (a Voice over IP phone could try to fetch vCards\n\
    \   for all outbound and inbound calls taking place on that phone and\n   display\
    \ them together with the call journal).  In a more integrated\n   scenario, information\
    \ gathered from those vCards could even be\n   automatically incorporated into\
    \ the personal information manager\n   application of the respective user.\n"

  contents:
  - "3.  Enumservice Registration - vCard\n   Enumservice Name: \"vCard\"\n   Enumservice\
    \ Type: \"vcard\"\n   Enumservice Subtype: n/a\n   URI Schemes: \"http\", \"https\"\
    \n   Functional Specification:\n      This Enumservice indicates that the resource\
    \ identified is a plain\n      vCard, according to RFC 2426, which may be accessed\
    \ using HTTP/\n      HTTPS [7].\n      Clients fetching the vCard from the resource\
    \ indicated should\n      expect access to be restricted.  Additionally, the comprehension\n\
    \      of the data provided may vary depending on the client's identity.\n   Security\

- title: 4.  Example
  contents:
  - "4.  Example\n   An example ENUM entry referencing to a vCard could look like:\n\
    \      $ORIGIN 6.4.9.0.6.4.9.7.0.2.4.4.e164.arpa.\n      @  IN NAPTR 100 10 \"\

- title: 5.  Security and Privacy Considerations
  contents:
  - "5.  Security and Privacy Considerations\n   As with any Enumservice, the security\
    \ considerations of ENUM itself\n   (Section 6 of RFC 3761) apply.\n"
- title: 5.1.  The ENUM Record Itself
  contents:
  - "5.1.  The ENUM Record Itself\n   Since ENUM uses DNS -- a publicly available\
    \ database -- any\n   information contained in records provisioned in ENUM domains\
    \ must be\n   considered public as well.  Even after revoking the DNS entry and\n\
    \   removing the referred resource, copies of the information could still\n  \
    \ be available.\n   Information published in ENUM records could reveal associations\n\
    \   between E.164 numbers and their owners - especially if URIs contain\n   personal\
    \ identifiers or domain names for which ownership information\n   can be obtained\
    \ easily.  For example, the following URI makes it easy\n   to guess the owner\
    \ of an E.164 number, as well as his location and\n   association, by just examining\
    \ the result from the ENUM lookup:\n      http://sandiego.company.example.com/joe-william-user.vcf\n\
    \   However, it is important to note that the ENUM record itself does not\n  \
    \ need to contain any personal information.  It just points to a\n   location\
    \ where access to personal information could be granted.  For\n   example, the\
    \ following URI only reveals the service provider hosting\n   the vCard (who probably\
    \ even provides anonymous hosting):\n      http://anonhoster.example.org/file_adfa001.vcf\n\
    \   ENUM records pointing to third-party resources can easily be\n   provisioned\
    \ on purpose by the ENUM domain owner - so any assumption\n   about the association\
    \ between a number and an entity could therefore\n   be completely bogus unless\
    \ some kind of identity verification is in\n   place.  This verification is out\
    \ of scope for this memo.\n"
- title: 5.2.  The Resource Identified
  contents:
  - "5.2.  The Resource Identified\n   In most cases, vCards provide information about\
    \ individuals.  Linking\n   telephone numbers to such Personally Identifiable\
    \ Information (PII)\n   is a very sensitive topic, because it provides a \"reverse\
    \ lookup\"\n   from the number to its owner.  Publication of such PII is covered\
    \ by\n   data-protection law in many legislations.  In most cases, the\n   explicit\
    \ consent of the affected individual is required.\n   Users MUST therefore carefully\
    \ consider information they provide in\n   the resource identified by the ENUM\
    \ record as well as in the record\n   itself.  Considerations SHOULD include serving\
    \ information only to\n   entities of the user's choice and/or limiting the comprehension\
    \ of\n   the information provided based on the identity of the requestor.\n  \
    \ The use of HTTP in this Enumservice allows using built-in\n   authentication,\
    \ authorization, and session control mechanisms to be\n   used to maintain access\
    \ controls on vCards.  Most notable, Digest\n   Authentication [8] could be used\
    \ to challenge requestors, and even\n   synthesize vCards based on the client's\
    \ identity (or refuse access\n   entirely).  This could especially be useful in\
    \ private ENUM\n   deployments (like within enterprises), where clients would\
    \ more\n   likely have a valid credential to access the indicated resource.\n\
    \   Even public deployments could synthesize vCards based on the identity\n  \
    \ of the client.  Social network sites, for example, could (based on\n   HTTP\
    \ session data like cookies [9]) provide more comprehensive vCards\n   to their\
    \ members than to anonymous clients.\n   If access restrictions on the vCard resource\
    \ are deployed, standard\n   HTTP authentication, authorization, and state management\
    \ mechanisms\n   (as described in RFCs 2617 and 2695) MUST be used to enforce\
    \ those\n   restrictions.  HTTPS SHOULD be preferred if the deployed mechanisms\n\
    \   are prone to eavesdropping and replay attacks.\n   ENUM deployments using\
    \ this Enumservice together with DNS Security\n   Extensions (DNSSEC) [10] should\
    \ consider using Minimally Covering\n   NSEC Records [11] to prevent zone walking,\
    \ as the PII data contained\n   in vCards constitutes a rich target for such attempts.\n"
