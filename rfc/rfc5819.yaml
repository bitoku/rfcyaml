  title: 1.  Introduction
- contents:
  - "2.  STATUS Return Option to LIST Command\n   [RFC3501] explicitly disallows mailbox
    patterns in the STATUS\n   command.  The main reason was to discourage frequent
    use of the\n   STATUS command by clients, as it might be quite expensive for an
    IMAP\n   server to perform.  However, this prohibition had resulted in an\n   opposite
    effect: a new generation of IMAP clients appeared, that\n   issues a STATUS command
    for each mailbox returned by the LIST\n   command.  This behavior is suboptimal
    to say at least.  It wastes\n   extra bandwidth and, in the case of a client that
    doesn't support\n   IMAP pipelining, also degrades performance by using too many
    round\n   trips.  This document tries to remedy the situation by specifying a\n
    \  single command that can be used by the client to request all the\n   necessary
    information.  In order to achieve this goal, this document\n   is extending the
    LIST command with a new return option, STATUS.  This\n   option takes STATUS data
    items as parameters.  For each selectable\n   mailbox matching the list pattern
    and selection options, the server\n   MUST return an untagged LIST response followed
    by an untagged STATUS\n   response containing the information requested in the
    STATUS return\n   option.\n   If an attempted STATUS for a listed mailbox fails
    because the mailbox\n   can't be selected (e.g., if the \"l\" ACL right [ACL]
    is granted to the\n   mailbox and the \"r\" right is not granted, or due to a
    race condition\n   between LIST and STATUS changing the mailbox to \\NoSelect),
    the\n   STATUS response MUST NOT be returned and the LIST response MUST\n   include
    the \\NoSelect attribute.  This means the server may have to\n   buffer the LIST
    reply until it has successfully looked up the\n   necessary STATUS information.\n
    \  If the server runs into unexpected problems while trying to look up\n   the
    STATUS information, it MAY drop the corresponding STATUS reply.\n   In such a
    situation, the LIST command would still return a tagged OK\n   reply.\n"

    * LIST () \".\"  \"INBOX\"\n   S: * STATUS \"INBOX\" (MESSAGES 17 UNSEEN 16)\n
    \  S: * LIST () \".\" \"foo\"\n   S: * STATUS \"foo\" (MESSAGES 30 UNSEEN 29)\n
    \  S: * LIST (\\NoSelect) \".\" \"bar\"\n   S: A01 OK List completed.\n   The
    \"bar\" mailbox isn't selectable, so it has no STATUS reply.\n   C: A02 LIST (SUBSCRIBED
    RECURSIVEMATCH)\"\" % RETURN (STATUS\n      (MESSAGES))\n   S: * LIST (\\Subscribed)
    \".\"  \"INBOX\"\n   S: * STATUS \"INBOX\" (MESSAGES 17)\n   S: * LIST () \".\"
    \"foo\" (CHILDINFO (\"SUBSCRIBED\"))\n   S: A02 OK List completed.\n   The LIST
    reply for \"foo\" is returned because it has matching\n   children, but no STATUS
    reply is returned because \"foo\" itself\n   doesn't match the selection criteria.\n"

    \  Form (BNF) as described in [ABNF].  Terms not defined here are taken\n   from
    [RFC3501] and [LISTEXT].\n   return-option =/ status-option\n   status-option
    = \"STATUS\" SP \"(\" status-att *(SP status-att) \")\"\n                   ;;

  - "5.  Security Considerations\n   This extension makes it a bit easier for clients
    to overload the\n   server by requesting STATUS information for a large number
    of\n   mailboxes.  However, as already noted in the introduction, existing\n   clients
    already try to do that by generating a large number of STATUS\n   commands for
    each mailbox in which they are interested.  While\n   performing STATUS information
    retrieval for big lists of mailboxes, a\n   server implementation needs to make
    sure that it can still serve\n   other IMAP connections and yield execution to
    other connections, when\n   necessary.\n"
