Abstract The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has recently specified the Cipher based Message Authentication Code (CMAC), which is equivalent to the One Key CBC MAC1 (OMAC1) algorithm submitted by Iwata and Kurosawa.
OMAC1 efficiently reduces the key size of Extended Cipher Block Chaining mode (XCBC).
This memo specifies the use of CMAC mode on the authentication mechanism of the IPsec Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) and the Authentication Header (AH) protocols.
This new algorithm is named AES CMAC 96.
The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has recently specified the Cipher based Message Authentication Code (CMAC).
CMAC [NIST CMAC] is a message authentication code that is based on a symmetric key block cipher such as the Advanced Encryption Standard [NIST AES].
CMAC is equivalent to the One Key CBC MAC1 (OMAC1) submitted by Iwata and Kurosawa [OMAC1a, OMAC1b].
OMAC1 is an improvement of the eXtended Cipher Block Chaining mode (XCBC) submitted by Black and Rogaway [XCBCa, XCBCb], which itself is an improvement of the basic CBC MAC.
XCBC efficiently addresses the security deficiencies of CBC MAC, and OMAC1 efficiently reduces the key size of XCBC.
This memo specifies the usage of CMAC on the authentication mechanism of the IPsec Encapsulating Security Payload [ESP] and Authentication Header [AH] protocols.
This new algorithm is named AES CMAC 96.
For further information on AH and ESP, refer to [AH] and [ROADMAP].
A bit string of a fixed length, computed by the MAC generation algorithm, that is used to establish the authority and, hence, the integrity of a message.
Denoted by M. Length (len)
The length of message M in octets.
The minimum value is 0.
The maximum value is not specified in this document.
Truncate T (MAC) in most significant bit first (MSB first) order to a length of l octets.
The output of AES CMAC.
The truncated output of AES CMAC 128 in MSB first order.
The core of AES CMAC 96 is the AES CMAC [AES CMAC].
The underlying algorithms for AES CMAC are the Advanced Encryption Standard cipher block [NIST AES] and the recently defined CMAC mode of operation [NIST CMAC].
AES CMAC provides stronger assurance of data integrity than a checksum or an error detecting code.
The verification of a checksum or an error detecting code detects only accidental modifications of the data, while CMAC is designed to detect intentional, unauthorized modifications of the data, as well as accidental modifications.
The output of AES CMAC can validate the input message.
Validating the message provides assurance of the integrity and authenticity over the message from the source.
According to [NIST CMAC], at least 64 bits should be used against guessing attacks.
AES CMAC achieves the similar security goal of HMAC [RFC HMAC].
Since AES CMAC is based on a symmetric key block cipher (AES), while HMAC is based on a hash function (such as SHA 1), AES CMAC is appropriate for information systems in which AES is more readily available than a hash function.
Detailed information about AES CMAC is available in [AES CMAC] and [NIST CMAC].
For IPsec message authentication on AH and ESP, AES CMAC 96 should be used.
AES CMAC 96 is a AES CMAC with 96 bit truncated output in MSB first order.
The output is a 96 bit MAC that will meet the default authenticator length as specified in [AH].
The result of truncation is taken in MSB first order.
For further information on AES CMAC, refer to [AES CMAC] and [NIST CMAC].
In step 1, AES CMAC is applied to the message M in length len with key K.
In step 2, the output block T is truncated to 12 octets in MSB first order, and Truncated T (TT) is returned.
Algorithm AES CMAC 96 5.
These test cases are the same as those defined in [NIST CMAC], with the exception of 96 bit truncation.
