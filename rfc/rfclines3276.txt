Abstract This document defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB) module for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
In particular, it describes objects used for managing
High Bit Rate DSL 2nd generation (HDSL2) and Single Pair High Speed Digital Subscriber Line (SHDSL) interfaces.
This document defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB) module for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
In particular, it describes objects used for managing High Bit Rate DSL 2nd generation (HDSL2)
High Speed Digital Subscriber Line (SHDSL) interfaces [19].
The SNMP Management Framework presently consists of five major components:  An overall architecture, described in RFC 2571 [1].
Mechanisms for describing and naming objects and events for the purpose of management.
The first version of this Structure of Management Information (SMI) is called SMIv1 and is described in STD 16, RFC 1155 [2], STD 16, RFC 1212 [3], and RFC 1215 [4].
The second version, called SMIv2, is described in STD 58, RFC 2578 [5], RFC 2579 [6], and RFC 2580 [7].
Message protocols for transferring management information.
The first version of the SNMP message protocol is called SNMPv1 and is described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [8].
A second version of the SNMP message protocol, which is not an Internet standards track protocol, is called SNMPv2c and described is in RFC 1901 [9] and RFC 1906 [10].
The third version of the message protocol is called SNMPv3 and is described in RFC 1906 [10], RFC 2572 [11], and RFC 2574 [12].
Protocol operations for accessing management information.
The first set of protocol operations and associated PDU formats is described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [8].
A second set of protocol operations and associated PDU formats is described in RFC 1905 [13].
A set of fundamental applications described in RFC 2573 [14] and the view based access control mechanism described in RFC 2575 [15].
A more detailed introduction to the current SNMP Management Framework can be found in RFC 2570 [16].
Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed the Management Information Base or MIB.
Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the SMI.
This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2.
A MIB conforming to the SMIv1 can be produced through the appropriate translations.
The resulting translated MIB must be semantically equivalent, except where objects or events are omitted because no translation is possible (use of Counter64).
Some machine readable information in SMIv2 will be converted into textual descriptions in SMIv1 during the translation process.
However, this loss of machine readable information is not considered to change the semantics of the MIB.
The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [17].
This document describes an SNMP MIB for managing HDSL2/SHDSL Lines.
These definitions are based upon the specifications for the HDSL2 and SHDSL Embedded Operations Channel (EOC) as defined in ANSI
[18] and ITU G.991.2 [19].
The MIB is located in the MIB tree under MIB 2 transmission, as discussed in the MIB 2 Integration (RFC 1213 [20] and RFC 2863 [21]) section of this document.
Relationship of the HDSL2/SHDSL Line MIB to other MIBs
This section outlines the relationship of this MIB with other MIBs described in RFCs.
Specifically, IF MIB as presented in RFC 2863 [21] is discussed.
3.1.1  General IF MIB Integration (RFC 2863)
The HDSL2/SHDSL Line MIB specifies the detailed attributes of a data interface.
As such, it needs to integrate with RFC 2863 [21].
The IANA has assigned the following ifTypes to HDSL2 and SHDSL:
The MIB branch identified by this ifType contains tables appropriate for this interface type.
Most such tables extend the ifEntry table, and are indexed by ifIndex.
For interfaces in systems implementing this MIB, those table entries indexed by ifIndex MUST be persistent.
The following attributes are part of the mandatory ifGeneral group in RFC 2863 [21], and are not duplicated in the HDSL2/SHDSL Line MIB.
(This is fixed at 1552000 for HDSL2 lines)
This object MUST have an octet string with zero length.
(For HDSL2 lines, this is fixed at 2)
Use of ifTable Objects 3.2 IANA Considerations
The HDSL2 SHDSL LINE MIB module requires the allocation of a single object identifier for its MODULE IDENTITY.
The IANA has allocated this object identifier in the transmission subtree (48), defined in the SNMPv2 SMI MIB module.
Conventions used in the MIB 4.1.
Naming Conventions A.  xtuC refers to a central site terminal unit;
H2TU C for HDSL2, or STU C for SHDSL.
B.  xtuR refers to a remote site terminal unit; H2TU R for HDSL2, or STU R for SHDSL.
C.  xtu refers to a terminal unit; either an xtuC or xtuR. D.  xru refer to a regenerator unit; H2RU for HDSL2, or SRU for SHDSL.
E.  xU refers to any HDSL2/SHDSL unit; either an xtu or xru.
F.  CRC is cyclic redundancy check [19].
G.  ES means errored second [19].
H.  LOSW means loss of sync word [19].
I.  LOSWS means LOSW seconds [19].
J.  SES means severely errored second [19].
K.  SNR means signal to noise ratio [19].
L.  UAS means unavailable second [19].
The following textual conventions are defined to reflect the line topology in the MIB (further discussed in the following section) and to define the behavior of the statistics to be maintained by an agent.

The MIB is structured into following MIB groups:
This group supports MIB objects for configuring parameters for the HDSL2/SHDSL span.
It contains the following table:
Span Status Group: This group supports MIB objects for retrieving span status information.
It contains the following table:
: This group supports MIB objects for retrieving unit inventory information about units in HDSL2/SHDSL lines via the EOC.
It contains the following table: hdsl2ShdslInventoryTable   Segment Endpoint Configuration Group: This group supports MIB objects for configuring parameters for the HDSL2/SHDSL segment endpoints.
It contains the following table:
hdsl2ShdslEndpointConfTable   Segment Endpoint Current Status/Performance Group: This group supports MIB objects that provide the current status/performance information relating to segment endpoints.
It contains the following table:
hdsl2ShdslEndpointCurrTable   Segment Endpoint 15 Minute Interval Status/Performance Group:
This group supports MIB objects that provide historic status/performance information relating to segment endpoints in 15  minute intervals.
It contains the following table:
hdsl2Shdsl15MinIntervalTable   Segment Endpoint 1 Day Interval Status/Performance Group: This group supports MIB objects that provide historic status/performance information relating to segment endpoints in 1 day intervals.
It contains the following table: hdsl2Shdsl1DayIntervalTable
This group supports MIB objects for performing maintenance operations such as loopbacks for HDSL2/SHDSL lines.
It contains the following table(s):
Span Configuration Profile Group: This group supports MIB objects for defining configuration profiles for HDSL2/SHDSL Spans.
It contains the following table: hdsl2ShdslSpanConfProfileTable
Segment Endpoint Alarm Configuration Profile Group: This group supports MIB objects for defining alarm configuration profiles for HDSL2/SHDSL Segment Endpoints.
It contains the following table: hdsl2ShdslEndpointAlarmConfProfileTable
Notifications Group: This group defines the notifications supported for HDSL2/SHDSL lines: hdsl2ShdslLoopAttenCrossing hdsl2ShdslSNRMarginCrossing hdsl2ShdslPerfESThresh hdsl2ShdslPerfSESThresh
hdsl2ShdsldeviceFault hdsl2ShdsldcContinuityFault hdsl2ShdslconfigInitFailure hdsl2ShdslprotocolInitFailure hdsl2ShdslnoNeighborPresent hdsl2ShdslLocalPowerLoss
An HDSL2/SHDSL Line consists of a minimum of two units
(the central termination unit) and an xtuR (the remote termination unit).
The line may optionally support up to 8 repeater/regenerator units (xru) as shown in the figure below.
Figure 2: General topology for an HDSL2/SHDSL Line 4.4.
Counters, Interval Buckets and Thresholds For SNR Margin, Loop Attenuation, ES, SES, CRC anomalies, LOSW, and UAS, there are event counters, current 15 minute and 0 to 96 15  minute history bucket(s) of "interval counters", as well as current and 0 to 30 previous 1 day interval counter(s).
Each current 15  minute event bucket has an associated threshold notification.
Unlike RFC 2493 [22] and RFC 2662 [23], there is no representation in the MIB for invalid buckets.
In those cases where the data for an interval is suspect or known to be invalid, the agent MUST NOT report the interval.
If the current 15 minute event bucket is determined to be invalid, notifications based upon the value of the event bucket MUST NOT be generated.
Not reporting an interval will result in holes in the associated table.
For example, the table, hdsl2Shdsl15MinIntervalTable, is indexed by { ifIndex, hdsl2ShdslInvIndex, hdsl2ShdslEndpointSide, hdsl2ShdslEndpointWirePair, hdsl2Shdsl15MinIntervalNumber}.
If interval 12 is determined to be invalid but intervals 11 and 13 are valid, a Get Next operation on the indices .1.1.1.1.11 would return indices .1.1.1.1.13.
There is no requirement for an agent to ensure a fixed relationship between the start of a fifteen minute interval and any wall clock; however some implementations may align the fifteen minute intervals with quarter hours.
Likewise, an implementation may choose to align one day intervals with the start of a day.
Counters are not reset when an xU is reinitialized, only when the agent is reset or reinitialized (or under specific request outside the scope of this MIB).
As a managed node can handle a large number of xUs, (e.g., hundreds or perhaps thousands of lines), provisioning every parameter on every xU may become burdensome.
Moreover, most lines are provisioned identically with the same set of parameters.
To simplify the provisioning process, this MIB makes use of profiles.
A profile is a set of parameters that can be shared by multiple lines using the same configuration.
The following profiles are used in this MIB:
Span Configuration Profiles Span configuration profiles contain parameters for configuring HDSL2/SHDSL spans.
They are defined in the hdsl2ShdslSpanConfProfileTable.
Since span configuration parameters are only applicable for SHDSL, the support for span configuration profiles are optional for HDSL2 interfaces.
Note that the configuration of the span dictates the behavior for each individual segment end point in the span.
If a different configuration is provisioned for any given segment end point within the span, the new configuration for this segment end point will override the span configuration for this segment end point only.
Segment Endpoint Alarm Configuration Profiles
These profiles contain parameters for configuring alarm thresholds for HDSL2/SHDSL segment endpoints.
These profiles are defined in the hdsl2ShdslEndpointAlarmConfProfileTable.
The index value for this profile is a locally unique administratively assigned name for the profile having the textual convention `SnmpAdminString' (RFC 2571 [1]).
One or more lines may be configured to share parameters of a single profile (e.g., hdsl2ShdslEndpointAlarmConfProfile   `silver') by setting its hdsl2ShdslEndpointAlarmConfProfile objects to the value of this profile.
If a change is made to the profile, all lines that refer to it will be reconfigured to the changed parameters.
Before a profile can be deleted or taken out of service it must be first unreferenced from all associated lines.
Implementations MUST provide a default profile whose name is `DEFVAL' for each profile type.
The values of the associated parameters will be vendor specific unless otherwise indicated in this document.
Before a line's profiles have been set, these profiles will be automatically used by setting hdsl2ShdslEndpointAlarmConfProfile and hdsl2ShdslSpanConfProfile to `DEFVAL' where appropriate.
This default profile name, 'DEFVAL', is considered reserved in the context of profiles defined in this MIB.
Profiles are created, assigned, and deleted dynamically using the profile name and profile row status in each of the four profile tables.
Profile changes MUST take effect immediately.
These changes MAY result in a restart (hard reset or soft restart) of the units on the line.
The ability to generate the SNMP notifications coldStart/WarmStart (per [21]) which are per agent (e.g., per Digital Subscriber Line Access Multiplexer, or DSLAM, in such a device), and linkUp/linkDown (per [21]) which are per interface (i.e., HDSL2/SHDSL line) is required.
A linkDown notification MAY be generated whenever any of ES, SES, CRC Anomaly, LOSW, or UAS event occurs.
The corresponding linkUp notification MAY be sent when all link failure conditions are cleared.
The notifications defined in this MIB are for initialization failure and for the threshold crossings associated with the following events: ES, SES, CRC Anomaly, LOSW, and UAS.
Each threshold has its own enable/threshold value.
When that value is 0, the notification is disabled.
The hdsl2ShdslEndpointCurrStatus is a bitmask representing all outstanding error conditions associated with a particular Segment Endpoint.
that since status of remote endpoints is obtained via the EOC, this information may be unavailable for units that are unreachable via EOC during a line error condition.
Therefore, not all conditions may always be included in its current status.
Notifications corresponding to the bit fields in this object are defined.
Two alarm conditions, SNR Margin Alarm and Loop Attenuation Alarm, are organized in a manner slightly different from that implied in the EOC specifications.
In the MIB, these alarm conditions are tied to the two thresholds hdsl2ShdslEndpointThreshSNRMargin and hdsl2ShdslEndpointThreshLoopAttenuation found in the hdsl2ShdslEndpointAlarmConfProfileTable.
In the EOC, the alarm conditions associated with these thresholds are per unit.
In the MIB, these alarm conditions are per endpoint.
For terminal units, this has no impact.
For repeaters, this implies an implementation variance where the agent in the terminal unit is responsible for detecting a threshold crossing.
As the reporting of a repeater detected alarm condition to the polling terminal unit occurs in the same EOC message as the reporting of the current SNR Margin and Loop Attenuation values, it is anticipated that this will have very little impact on agent implementation.
A threshold notification occurs whenever the corresponding current 15 minute interval error counter becomes equal to, or exceeds the threshold value.
One notification may be sent per interval per interface.
Since the current 15 minute counter is reset to 0 every 15 minutes, and if the condition persists, the notification may recur as  often as every 15 minutes.
For example, to get a notification whenever a "loss of" event occurs (but at most once every 15 minutes), set the corresponding threshold to 1.
The agent will generate a notification when the event originally occurs.
Note that the Network Management System, or NMS, may receive a linkDown notification, as well, if enabled (via ifLinkUpDownTrapEnable [21]).
At the beginning of the next 15 minute interval, the counter is reset.
When the first second goes by and the event occurs, the current interval bucket will be 1, which equals the threshold, and the notification will be sent again.
A hdsl2ShdslSpanInvalidNumRepeaters notification may be generated following completion of the discovery phase if the number of repeaters discovered on the line differs from the number of repeaters specified in hdsl2ShdslSpanConfNumRepeaters.
For those conditions where the number of provisioned repeaters is greater than those encountered during span discovery, all table entries associated with the nonexistent repeaters are to be discarded.
For those conditions where the number of provisioned repeaters is less than those encountered during span discovery, additional table entries are to be created using the default span configuration profile.
Conformance and Compliance For both HDSL2 and SHDSL lines, the following group(s) are mandatory:
hdsl2ShdslSpanConfGroup hdsl2ShdslSpanStatusGroup hdsl2ShdslInventoryGroup hdsl2ShdslEndpointConfGroup hdsl2Shdsl15MinIntervalGroup hdsl2Shdsl1DayIntervalGroup hdsl2ShdslMaintenanceGroup hdsl2ShdslEndpointAlarmConfGroup hdsl2ShdslNotificationGroup For HDSL2 lines, the following group(s) are optional:

This MIB module defines a collection of objects for managing HDSL2/SHDSL lines.
An agent may reside at either end of the line, however the MIB is designed to require no management communication between the modems beyond that inherent in the low level EOC line protocol as defined in ANSI
(for HDSL2 lines), or in ITU G.991.2 (for SHDSL lines).
" REVISION "200205090000Z"   May 9, 2002 DESCRIPTION "
"A gauge associated with interface performance measurements in a current 1 day (24 hour) measurement interval.
The value of this gauge starts at zero at the beginning of an interval and is increased when associated events occur, until the end of the 1 day interval.
At that time the value of the gauge is stored in the previous 1 day history interval, as defined in a companion object of type Hdsl2Shdsl1DayIntevalCount, and the current interval gauge is restarted at zero.
In the case where the agent has no valid data available for this interval the corresponding object instance is not available and upon a retrieval request a corresponding error message shall be returned to indicate that this instance does not exist.
Please note that zero is a valid value."
"A counter associated with interface performance measurements during the most previous 1 day (24 hour) measurement interval.
The value of this gauge is equal to the value of the current day gauge, as defined in a companion object of type Hdsl2ShdslPerfCurrDayCount, at the end of its most recent interval.
In the case where the agent has no valid data available for this interval the corresponding object instance is not available and upon a retrieval request a corresponding error message shall be returned to indicate that this instance does not exist."
TEXTUAL CONVENTION STATUS    current DESCRIPTION
"The number of seconds that have elapsed since the beginning of the current measurement period.
If, for some reason, such as an adjustment in the system's time of day clock or the addition of a leap second, the current interval exceeds the maximum value, the agent will return the maximum value.
For 15 minute intervals, the range is limited to (0..899).
For 24 hour intervals, the range is limited to (0..86399)."
TEXTUAL CONVENTION STATUS    current DESCRIPTION
"This convention defines a range of values that may be set in a fault threshold alarm control.
As the number of seconds in a 15 minute interval numbers at most 900, objects of this type may have a range of 0...900, where the value of 0 disables the alarm."

Security Considerations Blocking unauthorized access to the HDSL2 SHDSL MIB via the element management system is outside the scope of this document.
It should be noted that access to the MIB permits the unauthorized entity to modify the profiles (section 6.4) such that both subscriber service and network operations can be interfered with.
Subscriber service can be altered by modifying any of a number of service characteristics such as rate partitioning and maximum transmission rates.
Network operations can be impacted by modification of notification thresholds such as SES thresholds.
There are a number of managed objects in this MIB that may be considered to contain sensitive information.
Access to these objects would allow an intruder to obtain information about which vendor's equipment is in use on the network.
Further, such information is considered sensitive in many environments for competitive reasons.
These identifying objects in the inventory group are: hdsl2ShdslInvVendorID hdsl2ShdslInvVendorModelNumber hdsl2ShdslInvVendorSerialNumber
Therefore, it may be important in some environments to control read access to these objects and possibly to even encrypt the values of these object when sending them over the network via SNMP.
Not all versions of SNMP provide features for such a secure environment.
It is recommended that the implementors consider the security features as provided by the SNMPv3 framework.
Specifically, the use of the User based Security Model RFC 2574 [12] and the View based Access Control Model RFC 2575
It is then the customer/user's responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an instance of this MIB, is properly configured to give access to those objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate rights to access them.
HDSL2 SHDSL layer connectivity from the xtuR will permit the subscriber to manipulate both the HDSL2 SHDSL link directly and the HDSL2 SHDSL embedded  operations channel (EOC) for their own loop.
For example, unchecked or unfiltered fluctuations initiated by the subscriber could generate sufficient notifications to potentially overwhelm either the management interface to the network or the element manager.
It should be noted that interface indices in this MIB are maintained persistently.
VACM data relating to these should be stored persistently.
There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB that have a MAX ACCESS clause of read write and/or read create.
Such objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.
The support for SET operations in a non secure environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on network operations.
