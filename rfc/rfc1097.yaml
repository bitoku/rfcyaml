  - "2.  Command meanings.\n   IAC WILL SUBLIMINAL-MESSAGE\n      The sender of this\
    \ command REQUESTS permission to, or confirms\n      that it will, display subliminal\
    \ messages.\n   IAC WONT SUBLIMINAL-MESSAGE\n      The sender of this command\
    \ REFUSES to display subliminal messages.\n   IAC DO SUBLIMINAL-MESSAGE\n    \
    \  The sender of this command REQUESTS that the receiver, or grants\n      the\
    \ receiver permission to, display subliminal messages.\n   IAC DONT SUBLIMINAL-MESSAGE\n\

    \  subliminal messages.\n   IAC SB SUBLIMINAL-MESSAGE <16-bit value> <16-bit value>\
    \ <string> IAC\n      SE\n      The sender specifies a message to be subliminaly\
    \ displayed by the\n      remote host.  If the client has agreed (via the standard\
    \ WILL WONT\n      DO DONT mechanism) to display subliminal messages, it must\
    \ accept\n      this subnegotiation and attempt to display the message string\
    \ on\n      the users console for the specified duration and continue to do so\n\
    \      at fixed intervals until another SUBLIMINAL-MESSAGE subnegotiation\n  \
    \    is received.  The position and rendering of the message of\n      implementation\
    \ dependent.\n      The first 16-bit value specifies the duration of the message\
    \ in\n      milliseconds.  It is sent MSB first.  The second 16-bit value\n  \
    \    specifies the frequency with which the message is displayed.  It\n      represents\
    \ the number of seconds between displays and is also sent\n      MSB first.  The\
    \ final parameter is the message itself.\n      The syntax for this subnegotiation\
    \ is:\n                IAC SB SUBLIMINAL-MESSAGE\n                    DURATION[1]\
    \ DURATION[0]\n                    FREQUENCY[1] FREQUENCY[0]\n               \
    \     MESSAGE_STRING\n                IAC SE\n      As required by the Telnet\
    \ protocol, any occurence of 255 in the\n      subnegotiation must be doubled\
    \ to destinguish it from the IAC\n      character (which has a value of 255).\n"

- title: 4.  Motivation for the option
  contents:
  - "4.  Motivation for the option\n   Frequently the use of \"Message of the day\"\
    \ banners and newsletters is\n   insufficient to convince stubborn users to upgrade\
    \ to the latest\n   version of telnet.  Some users will use the same outdated\
    \ version for\n   years.  I ran across this problem trying to convince people\
    \ to use\n   the REMOTE-FLOW-CONTROL Telnet option.  These users need to be gently\n\
    \   \"persuaded\".\n"

  - "5.  Description and implementation notes.\n   The quality of the client implementation\
    \ will depend on it's ability\n   to display and erase text strings in a small\
    \ amount of time.  The\n   current implementation at CMU takes into acount terminal\
    \ line speed,\n   advanced video capabilities, and screen phospher persistance\
    \ when\n   calculating how long to wait before erasing a message.\n   While it\
    \ is permitted for the client to display the message text\n   \"in-line\", best\
    \ results at obtained by printing the message at the\n   top or side of console\
    \ screen where it will just catch the corner of\n   the user's visual field.\n\
    \   A version is currently under development at CMU to display the\n   message\
    \ using morse-code over the keyboard caps-lock LED.\n"

    \         [The server is \"suggesting\" that the user employ a stable\n      \
    \   operating system, not an unreasonable request...]\n      The client should\
    \ immediately begin displaying the message and\n      should continue to do so\
    \ at regular intervals.\n   2.  Server preempts previous subliminal message.\n\
    \      (Server sends) IAC SB SUBLIMINAL-MESSAGE 0 5 0 20 \"Go home\" IAC SE\n\
    \      The client should now no longer display the previous message and\n    \
    \  should immediately begin displaying the new one.\n   3.  Server has messed\
    \ with user enough for one day.\n      (Server sends) IAC SB SUBLIMINAL-MESSAGE\
    \ 0 0 0 0 \"\" IAC SE\n      The client must cease display of any subliminal messages.\n"
