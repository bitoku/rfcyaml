- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   As an adjunct to the usual, two-way electronic mail service,\
    \ it is at\n   times useful to employ a one-way text notification service, called\n\
    \   radio paging.  This memo describes a technique for radio paging using\n  \
    \ the Internet mail infrastructure.  In particular, this memo focuses\n   on the\
    \ case in which radio pagers are identified via the\n   international telephone\
    \ network.\n   The technique described by this memo, mapping telephone numbers\
    \ to\n   domain names, is derived from the TPC.INT subdomain.  Consult RFC\n \
    \  1530, \"Principles of Operation for the TPC.INT Subdomain: General\n   Principles\
    \ and Policy\" for overview information.\n"
- title: 2.  Naming, Addressing, and Routing
  contents:
  - "2.  Naming, Addressing, and Routing\n   A radio pager is identified by a telephone\
    \ number, e.g.,\n     +1 415 940 8776\n   where \"+1\" indicates the IDDD country\
    \ code, and the remaining string\n   is a telephone number within that country.\n"
- title: 2.1.  Addressing
  contents:
  - "2.1.  Addressing\n   This number is used to construct the address of a radio\
    \ pager server,\n   which forms the recipient address for the message, e.g., one\
    \ of:\n     pager-alpha@6.7.7.8.0.4.9.5.1.4.1.tpc.int\n     pager-numeric@6.7.7.8.0.4.9.5.1.4.1.tpc.int\n\
    \   where the domain-part is constructed by reversing the telephone\n   number,\
    \ converting each digit to a domain-label, and being placed\n   under \"tpc.int.\"\
    \ (The telephone number must not include any\n   international access codes.)\n\
    \   In addition, addresses of the form\n     pager.ATOM@6.7.7.8.0.4.9.5.1.4.1.tpc.int\n\
    \     pager-alpha.ATOM@6.7.7.8.0.4.9.5.1.4.1.tpc.int\n     pager-numeric.ATOM@6.7.7.8.0.4.9.5.1.4.1.tpc.int\n\
    \   where \"ATOM\" is an (optional) RFC 822 atom [1], are reserved for\n   future\
    \ use.  Note that the mailbox syntax is purposefully restricted\n   in the interests\
    \ of pragmatism.  To paraphrase RFC 822, an atom is\n   defined as:\n     atom\
    \    = 1*atomchar\n     atomchar=   <any upper or lowercase alphabetic character\n\
    \                  (A-Z a-z)>\n               / <any digit (0-9)>\n          \
    \     / \"!\" / \"#\" / \"$\" / \"%\" / \"&\" / \"'\" / \"*\" / \"+\"\n      \
    \         / \"-\" / \"/\" / \"=\" / \"?\" / \"^\" / \"_\" / \"`\" / \"{\"\n  \
    \             / \"|\" / \"}\" / \"~\"\n   Finally, note that some Internet mail\
    \ software (especially gateways\n   from outside the Internet) impose stringent\
    \ limitations on the size\n   of a mailbox-string.  Thus, originating user agents\
    \ should take care\n   in limiting the local-part to no more than 70 or so characters.\n"
- title: 2.2.  Routing
  contents:
  - "2.2.  Routing\n   The message is routed in exactly the same fashion as all other\n\
    \   electronic mail, i.e., using the MX algorithm [2].  Since a radio\n   pager\
    \ server might be able to access many radio pagers, the\n   wildcarding facilities\
    \ of the DNS [3,4] are used accordingly.  For\n   example, if a radio pager server\
    \ residing at \"dbc.mtview.ca.us\" is\n   willing to access any radio pager with\
    \ a telephone number prefix of\n     +1 415 940\n   then this resource record\
    \ might be present\n     *.0.4.9.5.1.4.1.tpc.int.    IN MX 10 dbc.mtview.ca.us.\n\
    \   Naturally, if several radio pager servers were willing to access any\n   radio\
    \ pager in that prefix, multiple MX resource records would be\n   present.\n \
    \  It should be noted that the presence of a wildcard RR which matches a\n   radio\
    \ pager server's address does not imply that the corresponding\n   telephone number\
    \ is valid, or, if valid, that a radio pager is\n   identified by the phone number.\
    \  Rather, the presence of a wildcard\n   RR indicates that a radio pager server\
    \ is willing to attempt access.\n"
- title: 3.  Procedure
  contents:
  - "3.  Procedure\n   When information is to be sent to a radio pager, the user application\n\
    \   constructs an RFC 822 message, containing a \"Message-ID\" field and a\n \
    \  textual content (e.g., a \"text/plain\" content [5]).\n   The message is then\
    \ sent to the radio pager server's electronic mail\n   address.\n   The radio\
    \ pager server begins by looking at the local part of the\n   address.  If the\
    \ local-part is the literal string \"pager-alpha\" then\n   this indicates that\
    \ the recipient is using an alpha-numeric pager.\n   The radio pager server consults\
    \ a local database to determine how to\n   send the page based on the domain-part.\
    \  This local knowledge\n   includes information about the protocol used to talk\
    \ to the paging\n   network and the access number.  As such, a radio pager server\
    \ will\n   register itself in the DNS as providing service only to those phone\n\
    \   numbers for which it has such knowledge.\n   Otherwise, if the local-part\
    \ is the literal string \"pager-numeric\"\n   then this indicates that the recipient\
    \ is using a numeric pager.  The\n   radio pager server may consult a local database\
    \ to determine how to\n   send the page based on the domain-part; or, it may dial\
    \ the number\n   specified in the domain-part directly.\n   For alpha-numeric\
    \ pagers, the radio pager server determines which\n   information found in the\
    \ headers and body of the message are used\n   when constructing the paging message.\
    \  For example, some radio pager\n   servers might choose to examine the \"To\"\
    \ and \"Subject\" fields, in\n   addition to the body, whilst other radio pager\
    \ servers might choose\n   to simply send the body verbatim.\n   For numeric pagers,\
    \ the radio pager server sends only the body, which\n   must consistent solely\
    \ of digits.\n"
- title: 3.1.  MAILing versus SENDing
  contents:
  - "3.1.  MAILing versus SENDing\n   An SMTP client communicating with a radio pager\
    \ server may use\n   attempt either the MAIL or SEND command.  The radio pager\
    \ server MUST\n   support the MAIL command, and MAY support any of the SEND, SOML,\
    \ or\n   SAML commands.\n   If the MAIL command is used, then a positive completion\
    \ reply to both\n   the RCPT and DATA commands indicates, at a minimum, that the\
    \ message\n   has been queued for transmission into the radio paging network for\n\
    \   the recipient, but is at least queued for transmission into the radio\n  \
    \ paging network.\n   If the SEND command is used, then a positive completion\
    \ reply to both\n   the RCPT and DATA commands indicates that the message has\
    \ been\n   accepted by the radio paging network for delivery to the recipient.\n\
    \   If the SOML or SAML command is used, then a positive completion reply\n  \
    \ to both the RCPT and DATA commands indicates that the message may\n   have been\
    \ accepted by the radio paging network for delivery to the\n   recipient.\n"
- title: 3.2.  Latency
  contents:
  - "3.2.  Latency\n   Although the Internet electronic mail service tends to perform\n\
    \   delivery in a timely and reliable manner, some paging services will\n   wish\
    \ to provide a higher degree of assurance to their clients, in\n   particular\
    \ guaranteeing that a positive reply code means that the\n   page has been sent\
    \ on the radio network.  For such requirements, the\n   primary constraints are\
    \ server implementation and client/server\n   network connectivity.\n   A client\
    \ that uses the SEND or SAML commands is explicitly requesting\n   real-time transmission\
    \ on the radio network and is requiring that the\n   server reply code will carry\
    \ a statement of success or failure about\n   that transmission.\n   The IP level\
    \ of the Internet performs datagram store-and-forward\n   service, but gives the\
    \ end system hosts the appearance of direct\n   connectivity, by virtue of allowing\
    \ interactive service.  The\n   Internet electronic mail service adds another\
    \ layer of store-and-\n   forward indirection, so that messages may go through\
    \ any number of\n   relays (and/or gateways).  This may introduce arbitrarily\
    \ large\n   delays of minutes, hours, or days.\n   A client that configures their\
    \ Internet attachment to permit \"direct\"\n   SMTP connectivity to a pager server\
    \ will be able to submit paging\n   requests to the server directly, without additional\
    \ SMTP-relaying.\n   That is, transmission from paging client to paging server\
    \ will be one\n   \"SMTP-hop\"only.  This will eliminate any possibility of non-\n\
    \   deterministic delay by the Internet itself.\n   The combination of configuring\
    \ paging server and paging client to\n   allow direct IP/SMTP-level interaction\
    \ and ensuring that they use\n   SEND or SAML commands only will mean that a client\
    \ receiving a\n   positive reply from the server is assured that the page has\
    \ been sent\n   on the radio network.\n"
