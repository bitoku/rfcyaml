  - "Abstract\n   This document describes a mobility services framework design (MSFD)\n\
    \   for the IEEE 802.21 Media Independent Handover (MIH) protocol that\n   addresses\
    \ identified issues associated with the transport of MIH\n   messages.  The document\
    \ also describes mechanisms for Mobility\n   Services (MoS) discovery and transport-layer\
    \ mechanisms for the\n   reliable delivery of MIH messages.  This document does\
    \ not provide\n   mechanisms for securing the communication between a mobile node\
    \ (MN)\n   and the Mobility Server.  Instead, it is assumed that either lower-\n\
    \   layer (e.g., link-layer) security mechanisms or overall system-\n   specific\
    \ proprietary security solutions are used.\n"

- title: IESG Note
  contents:
  - "IESG Note\n   As described later in this specification, this protocol does not\n\
    \   provide security mechanisms.  In some deployment situations lower-\n   layer\
    \ security services may be sufficient.  Other situations require\n   proprietary\
    \ mechanisms or as yet incomplete standard mechanisms, such\n   as the ones currently\
    \ considered by IEEE.  For these reasons, the\n   specification recommends careful\
    \ analysis before considering any\n   deployment.\n   The IESG emphasizes the\
    \ importance of these recommendations.  The\n   IESG also notes that this specification\
    \ deviates from the traditional\n   IETF requirement that support for security\
    \ in the open Internet\n   environment is a mandatory part of any Standards Track\
    \ protocol\n   specification.  An exception has been made for this specification,\n\
    \   but this should not be taken to mean that other future specifications\n  \
    \ are free from this requirement.\n"

- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   This document proposes a solution to the issues identified\
    \ in the\n   problem statement document [RFC5164] for the layer 3 transport of\n\
    \   IEEE 802.21 MIH protocols.\n   The MIH Layer 3 transport problem is divided\
    \ into two main parts: the\n   discovery of a node that supports specific Mobility\
    \ Services (MoS)\n   and the transport of the information between a mobile node\
    \ (MN) and\n   the discovered node.  The discovery process is required for the\
    \ MN to\n   obtain the information needed for MIH protocol communication with\
    \ a\n   peer node.  The information includes the transport address (e.g., the\n\
    \   IP address) of the peer node and the types of MoS provided by the\n   peer\
    \ node.\n   This document lists the major MoS deployment scenarios.  It describes\n\
    \   the solution architecture, including the MSFD reference model and\n   MIHF\
    \ identifiers.  MoS discovery procedures explain how the MN\n   discovers Mobility\
    \ Servers in its home network, in a visited network\n   or in a third-party network.\
    \  The remainder of this document\n   describes the MIH transport architecture,\
    \ example message flows for\n   several signaling scenarios, and security issues.\n\
    \   This document does not provide mechanisms for securing the\n   communication\
    \ between a mobile node and the Mobility Server.\n   Instead, it is assumed that\
    \ either lower layer (e.g., link layer)\n   security mechanisms, or overall system-specific\
    \ proprietary security\n   solutions, are used.  The details of such lower layer\
    \ and/or\n   proprietary mechanisms are beyond the scope of this document.  It\
    \ is\n   RECOMMENDED against using this protocol without careful analysis that\n\
    \   these mechanisms meet the desired requirements, and encourages future\n  \
    \ standardization work in this area.  The IEEE 802.21a Task Group has\n   recently\
    \ started work on MIH security issues that may provide some\n   solution in this\
    \ area.  For further information, please refer to\n   Section 8.\n"
- title: 2.  Terminology
  contents:
  - "2.  Terminology\n   The following acronyms and terminology are used in this document:\n\
    \   Media Independent Handover (MIH): the handover support architecture\n    \
    \  defined by the IEEE 802.21 working group that consists of the MIH\n      Function\
    \ (MIHF), MIH Network Entities, and MIH protocol messages.\n   Media Independent\
    \ Handover Function (MIHF): a switching function that\n      provides handover\
    \ services including the Event Service (ES),\n      Information Service (IS),\
    \ and Command Service (CS), through\n      service access points (SAPs) defined\
    \ by the IEEE 802.21 working\n      group [IEEE80221].\n   MIHF User: An entity\
    \ that uses the MIH SAPs to access MIHF services,\n      and which is responsible\
    \ for initiating and terminating MIH\n      signaling.\n   Media Independent Handover\
    \ Function Identifier (MIHFID): an\n      identifier required to uniquely identify\
    \ the MIHF endpoints for\n      delivering mobility services (MoS); it is implemented\
    \ as either a\n      FQDN or NAI.\n   Mobility Services (MoS): composed of Information\
    \ Service, Command\n      Service, and Event Service provided by the network to\
    \ mobile nodes\n      to facilitate handover preparation and handover decision,\
    \ as\n      described in [IEEE80221] and [RFC5164].\n   MoSh:  Mobility Services\
    \ provided by the mobile node's Home Network.\n   MoSv:  Mobility Services provided\
    \ by the Visited Network.\n   MoS3: Mobility Services provided by a third-party\
    \ network, which is a\n      network that is neither the Home Network nor the\
    \ current Visited\n      Network.\n   Mobile Node (MN): an Internet device whose\
    \ location changes, along\n      with its point of connection to the network.\n\
    \   Mobility Services Transport Protocol (MSTP): a protocol that is used\n   \
    \   to deliver MIH protocol messages from an MIHF to other MIH-aware\n      nodes\
    \ in a network.\n   Information Service (IS): a MoS that originates at the lower\
    \ or upper\n      layers of the protocol stack and sends information to the local\
    \ or\n      remote upper or lower layers of the protocol stack.  The purpose\n\
    \      of IS is to exchange information elements (IEs) relating to\n      various\
    \ neighboring network information.\n   Event Service (ES): a MoS that originates\
    \ at a remote MIHF or the\n      lower layers of the local protocol stack and\
    \ sends information to\n      the local MIHF or local higher layers.  The purpose\
    \ of the ES is\n      to report changes in link status (e.g., Link Going Down\
    \ messages)\n      and various lower layer events.\n   Command Service (CS): a\
    \ MoS that sends commands from the remote MIHF\n      or local upper layers to\
    \ the remote or local lower layers of the\n      protocol stack to switch links\
    \ or to get link status.\n   Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN): a complete domain\
    \ name for a host\n      on the Internet, showing (in reverse order) the full\
    \ delegation\n      path from the DNS root and top-level domain down to the host\
    \ name\n      (e.g., myexample.example.org).\n   Network Access Identifier (NAI):\
    \ the user ID that a user submits\n      during network access authentication\
    \ [RFC4282].  For mobile users,\n      the NAI identifies the user and helps to\
    \ route the authentication\n      request message.\n   Network Address Translator\
    \ (NAT): a device that implements the\n      Network Address Translation function\
    \ described in [RFC3022], in\n      which local or private network layer addresses\
    \ are mapped to\n      routable (outside the NAT domain) network addresses and\
    \ port\n      numbers.\n   Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP): protocols\
    \ described in\n      [RFC2131] and [RFC3315] that allow Internet devices to obtain\n\
    \      respectively IPv4 and IPv6 addresses, subnet masks, default\n      gateway\
    \ addresses, and other IP configuration information from\n      DHCP servers.\n\
    \   Domain Name System (DNS): a protocol described in [RFC1035] that\n      translates\
    \ domain names to IP addresses.\n   Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting\
    \ (AAA): a set of network\n      management services that respectively determine\
    \ the validity of a\n      user's ID, determine whether a user is allowed to use\
    \ network\n      resources, and track users' use of network resources.\n   Home\
    \ AAA (AAAh): an AAA server located on the MN's home network.\n   Visited AAA\
    \ (AAAv): an AAA server located in a visited network that\n      is not the MN's\
    \ home network.\n   MIH Acknowledgement (MIH ACK): an MIH signaling message that\
    \ an MIHF\n      sends in response to an MIH message from a sending MIHF.\n  \
    \ Point of Service (PoS): a network-side MIHF instance that exchanges\n      MIH\
    \ messages with an MN-based MIHF.\n   Network Access Server (NAS): a server to\
    \ which an MN initially\n      connects when it is trying to gain a connection\
    \ to a network and\n      that determines whether the MN is allowed to connect\
    \ to the NAS's\n      network.\n   User Datagram Protocol (UDP): a connectionless\
    \ transport-layer\n      protocol used to send datagrams between a source and\
    \ a destination\n      at a given port, defined in RFC 768.\n   Transmission Control\
    \ Protocol (TCP): a stream-oriented transport-\n      layer protocol that provides\
    \ a reliable delivery service with\n      congestion control, defined in RFC 793.\n\
    \   Round-Trip Time (RTT): an estimation of the time required for a\n      segment\
    \ to travel from a source to a destination and an\n      acknowledgement to return\
    \ to the source that is used by TCP in\n      connection with timer expirations\
    \ to determine when a segment is\n      considered lost and should be resent.\n\
    \   Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU): the largest size of an IP packet\n      that\
    \ can be sent on a network segment without requiring\n      fragmentation [RFC1191].\n\
    \   Path MTU (PMTU): the largest size of an IP packet that can be sent on\n  \
    \    an end-to-end network path without requiring IP fragmentation.\n   Transport\
    \ Layer Security Protocol (TLS): an application layer\n      protocol that primarily\
    \ assures privacy and data integrity between\n      two communicating network\
    \ entities [RFC5246].\n   Sender Maximum Segment Size (SMSS): size of the largest\
    \ segment that\n      the sender can transmit as per [RFC5681].\n"

    \ divided into\n   two functional domains: discovery and transport.  The following\n\
    \   assumptions have been made:\n   o  The solution is primarily aimed at supporting\
    \ IEEE 802.21 MIH\n      services -- namely, Information Service (IS), Event Service\
    \ (ES),\n      and Command Service (CS).\n   o  If the MIHFID is available, FQDN\
    \ or NAI's realm is used for\n      mobility service discovery.\n   o  The solutions\
    \ are chosen to cover all possible deployment\n      scenarios as described in\
    \ Section 3.\n   o  MoS discovery can be performed during initial network attachment\n\
    \      or at any time thereafter.\n   The MN may know the realm of the Mobility\
    \ Server to be discovered.\n   The MN may also be pre-configured with the address\
    \ of the Mobility\n   Server to be used.  In case the MN does not know what realm\
    \ /\n   Mobility Server to query, dynamic assignment methods are described in\n\
    \   Section 5.\n   The discovery of the Mobility Server (and the related configuration\n\
    \   at MIHF level) is required to bind two MIHF peers (e.g., MN and\n   Mobility\
    \ Server) with their respective IP addresses.  Discovery MUST\n   be executed\
    \ in the following conditions:\n   o  Bootstrapping: upon successful Layer 2 network\
    \ attachment, the MN\n      MAY be required to use DHCP for address configuration.\
    \  These\n      procedures can carry the required information for MoS\n      configuration\
    \ in specific DHCP options.\n   o  If the MN does not receive MoS information\
    \ during network\n      attachment and the MN does not have a pre-configured Mobility\n\
    \      Server, it MUST run a discovery procedure upon initial IP address\n   \
    \   configuration.\n   o  If the MN changes its IP address (e.g., upon handover),\
    \ it MUST\n      refresh MIHF peer bindings (i.e., MIHF registration process).\
    \  In\n      case the Mobility Server used is not suitable anymore (e.g., too\n\
    \      large RTT experienced), the MN MAY need to perform a new discovery\n  \
    \    procedure.\n   o  If the MN is a multi-homed device and it communicates with\
    \ the\n      same Mobility Server via different IP addresses, it MAY run\n   \
    \   discovery procedures if one of the IP addresses changes.\n   Once the MIHF\
    \ peer has been discovered, MIH information can be\n   exchanged between MIH peers\
    \ over a transport protocol such as UDP or\n   TCP.  The usage of transport protocols\
    \ is described in Section 6 and\n   packing of the MIH messages does not require\
    \ extra framing since the\n   MIH protocol defined in [IEEE80221] already contains\
    \ a length field.\n"

    \   MIH peers MAY exchange information over TCP, UDP, or any other\n   transport\

- title: 6.1.  MIH Message Size
  contents:
  - "6.1.  MIH Message Size\n   Although the MIH message size varies widely from about\
    \ 30 bytes (for\n   a capability discovery request) to around 65000 bytes (for\
    \ an IS\n   MIH_Get_Information response primitive), a typical MIH message size\n\
    \   for the ES or CS ranges between 50 to 100 bytes [IEEE80221].  Thus,\n   considering\
    \ the effects of the MIH message size on the performance of\n   the transport\
    \ protocol brings us to discussing two main issues,\n   related to fragmentation\
    \ of long messages in the context of UDP and\n   the concatenation of short messages\
    \ in the context of TCP.\n   Since transporting long MIH messages may require\
    \ fragmentation that\n   is not available in UDP, if MIH is using UDP a limit\
    \ MUST be set on\n   the size of the MIH message based on the path MTU to destination\
    \ (or\n   the Minimum MTU where PMTU is not implemented).  The Minimum MTU\n \
    \  depends on the IP version used for transmission, and is the lesser of\n   the\
    \ first hop MTU, and 576 or 1280 bytes for IPv4 [RFC1122] or for\n   IPv6 [RFC2460],\
    \ respectively, although applications may reduce these\n   values to guard against\
    \ the presence of tunnels.\n   According to [IEEE80221], when an MIH message is\
    \ sent using an L3 or\n   higher-layer transport, L3 takes care of any fragmentation\
    \ issue and\n   the MIH protocol does not handle fragmentation in such cases.\
    \  Thus,\n   MIH layer fragmentation MUST NOT be used together with IP layer\n\
    \   fragmentation and MUST not be used when MIH packets are carried over\n   TCP.\n\
    \   The loss of an IP fragment leads to the retransmission of an entire\n   MIH\
    \ message, which in turn leads to poor end-to-end delay performance\n   in addition\
    \ to wasted bandwidth.  Additional recommendations in\n   [RFC5405] apply for\
    \ limiting the size of the MIH message when using\n   UDP and assuming IP layer\
    \ fragmentation.  In terms of dealing with\n   short messages, TCP has the capability\
    \ to concatenate very short\n   messages in order to reduce the overall bandwidth\
    \ overhead.  However,\n   this reduced overhead comes at the cost of additional\
    \ delay to\n   complete an MIH transaction, which may not be acceptable for CS\
    \ and\n   ES.  Note also that TCP is a stream-oriented protocol and measures\n\
    \   data flow in terms of bytes, not messages.  Thus, it is possible to\n   split\
    \ messages across multiple TCP segments if they are long enough.\n   Even short\
    \ messages can be split across two segments.  This can also\n   cause unacceptable\
    \ delays, especially if the link quality is severely\n   degraded as is likely\
    \ to happen when the MN is exiting a wireless\n   access coverage area.  The use\
    \ of the TCP_NODELAY option can\n   alleviate this problem by triggering transmission\
    \ of a segment less\n   than the SMSS.  (It should be noted that [RFC4960] addresses\
    \ both of\n   these problems, but discussion of SCTP is omitted here, as it is\n\
    \   generally not used for the mobility services discussed in this\n   document.)\n"
- title: 6.2.  MIH Message Rate
  contents:
  - "6.2.  MIH Message Rate\n   The frequency of MIH messages varies according to\
    \ the MIH service\n   type.  It is expected that CS/ES messages arrive at a rate\
    \ of one in\n   hundreds of milliseconds in order to capture quick changes in\
    \ the\n   environment and/or process handover commands.  On the other hand, IS\n\
    \   messages are exchanged mainly every time a new network is visited,\n   which\
    \ may be in order of hours or days.  Therefore, a burst of either\n   short CS/ES\
    \ messages or long IS message exchanges (in the case where\n   multiple MIH nodes\
    \ request information) may lead to network\n   congestion.  While the built-in\
    \ rate-limiting controls available in\n   TCP may be well suited for dealing with\
    \ these congestion conditions,\n   this may result in large transmission delays\
    \ that may be unacceptable\n   for the timely delivery of ES or CS messages. \
    \ On the other hand, if\n   UDP is used, a rate-limiting effect similar to the\
    \ one obtained with\n   TCP SHOULD be obtained by adequately adjusting the parameters\
    \ of a\n   token bucket regulator as defined in the MIH specifications\n   [IEEE80221].\
    \  Recommendations for token bucket parameter settings are\n   as follows:\n \
    \  o If the MIHF knows the RTT (e.g., based on the request/response MIH\n    \
    \  protocol exchange between two MIH peers), the rate can be based\n      upon\
    \ this as specified in [IEEE80221].\n   o  If not, then on average it SHOULD NOT\

    \  Communication failures are experienced when\n   middleboxes destroy the per-flow\

    \ does not exchange any UDP\n   traffic.  Hence, communication between the MN\

    \ and in\n   order to avoid such failures, MIH messages MAY be sent periodically,\n\
    \   similarly to keep-alive messages, in an attempt to refresh middlebox\n   state.\
    \  As [RFC4787] requires a minimum state timeout of 2 minutes or\n   more, MIH\

  - "6.5.  General Guidelines\n   The ES and CS messages are small in nature and have\
    \ tight latency\n   requirements.  On the other hand, IS messages are more resilient\
    \ in\n   terms of latency constraints, and some long IS messages could exceed\n\
    \   the MTU of the path to the destination.  TCP SHOULD be used as the\n   default\
    \ transport for all messages.  However, UDP in combination with\n   MIH acknowledgement\
    \ SHOULD be used for transporting ES and CS\n   messages that are shorter than\
    \ or equal to the path MTU as described\n   in Section 6.1.\n   For both UDP and\
    \ TCP cases, if a port number is not explicitly\n   assigned (e.g., by the DNS\
    \ SRV), MIH messages sent over UDP, TCP, or\n   other supported transport MUST\
    \ use the default port number defined in\n   Section 9 for that particular transport.\n\
    \   A Mobility Server MUST support both UDP and TCP for MIH transport and\n  \
    \ the MN MUST support TCP.  Additionally, the server and MN MAY support\n   additional\
    \ transport mechanisms.  The MN MAY use the procedures\n   defined in [RFC5679]\
    \ to discover additional transport protocols\n   supported by the server (e.g.,\
    \ SCTP).\n"
- title: 7.  Operation Flows
  contents:
  - "7.  Operation Flows\n   Figure 9 gives an example operation flow between MIHF\
    \ peers when an\n   MIH user requests an IS and both the MN and the Mobility Server\
    \ are\n   in the MN's home network.  DHCP is used for Mobility Services (MoS)\n\
    \   discovery, and TCP is used for establishing a transport connection to\n  \
    \ carry the IS messages.  When the Mobility Server is not pre-\n   configured,\
    \ the MIH user needs to discover the IP address of the\n   Mobility Server to\
    \ communicate with the remote MIHF.  Therefore, the\n   MIH user sends a discovery\
    \ request message to the local MIHF as\n   defined in [IEEE80221].\n   In this\
    \ example (one could draw similar mechanisms with DHCPv6), we\n   assume that\
    \ MoS discovery is performed before a transport connection\n   is established\
    \ with the remote MIHF, and the DHCP client process is\n   invoked via some internal\
    \ APIs.  The DHCP client sends a DHCP INFORM\n   message according to standard\
    \ DHCP and with the MoS option as defined\n   in [RFC5678].  The DHCP server replies\
    \ via a DHCP ACK message with\n   the IP address of the Mobility Server.  The\
    \ Mobility Server address\n   is then passed to the MIHF locally via some internal\
    \ APIs.  The MIHF\n   generates the discovery response message and passes it on\
    \ to the\n   corresponding MIH user.  The MIH user generates an IS query addressed\n\
    \   to the remote Mobility Server.  The MIHF invokes the underlying TCP\n   client,\
    \ which establishes a transport connection with the remote\n   peer.  Once the\
    \ transport connection is established, the MIHF sends\n   the IS query via an\
    \ MIH protocol REQUEST message.  The message and\n   query arrive at the destination\
    \ MIHF and MIH user, respectively.  The\n   Mobility Server MIH user responds\
    \ to the corresponding IS query and\n   the Mobility Server MIHF sends the IS\
    \ response via an MIH protocol\n   RESPONSE message.  The message arrives at the\
    \ source MIHF, which\n   passes the IS response on to the corresponding MIH user.\n\
    \                MN                                         MoS\n"

- title: 8.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "8.  Security Considerations\n   There are two components to the security considerations:\
    \ MoS\n   discovery and MIH transport.  For MoS discovery, DHCP and DNS\n   recommendations\
    \ are hereby provided per IETF guidelines.  For MIH\n   transport, we describe\
    \ the security threats and expect that the\n   system deployment will have means\
    \ to mitigate such threats when\n   sensitive information is being exchanged between\
    \ the mobile node and\n   Mobility Server.  Since IEEE 802.21 base specification\
    \ does not\n   provide MIH protocol level security, it is assumed that either\
    \ lower\n   layer security (e.g., link layer) or overall system-specific (e.g.,\n\
    \   proprietary) security solutions are available.  The present document\n   does\
    \ not provide any guidelines in this regard.  It is stressed that\n   the IEEE\
    \ 802.21a Task Group has recently started work on MIH security\n   issues that\
    \ may provide some solution in this area.  Finally,\n   authorization of an MN\
    \ to use a specific Mobility Server, as stated\n   in Section 5, is neither in\
    \ scope of this document nor is currently\n   specified in [IEEE80221].\n"
- title: 8.1.  Security Considerations for MoS Discovery
  contents:
  - "8.1.  Security Considerations for MoS Discovery\n   There are a number of security\
    \ issues that need to be taken into\n   account during node discovery.  In the\
    \ case where DHCP is used for\n   node discovery and authentication of the source\
    \ and content of DHCP\n   messages is required, network administrators SHOULD\
    \ use the DHCP\n   authentication option described in [RFC3118], where available,\
    \ or\n   rely upon link layer security.  [RFC3118] provides mechanisms for\n \
    \  both entity authentication and message authentication.  In the case\n   where\
    \ the DHCP authentication mechanism is not available,\n   administrators may need\
    \ to rely upon the underlying link layer\n   security.  In such cases, the link\
    \ between the DHCP client and Layer\n   2 termination point may be protected,\
    \ but the DHCP message source and\n   its messages cannot be authenticated or\
    \ the integrity of the latter\n   checked unless there exits a security binding\
    \ between link layer and\n   DHCP layer.\n   In the case where DNS is used for\
    \ discovering MoS, fake DNS requests\n   and responses may cause denial of service\
    \ (DoS) and the inability of\n   the MN to perform a proper handover, respectively.\
    \  Where networks\n   are exposed to such DoS, it is RECOMMENDED that DNS service\
    \ providers\n   use the Domain Name System Security Extensions (DNSSEC) as described\n\
    \   in [RFC4033].  Readers may also refer to [RFC4641] to consider the\n   aspects\
    \ of DNSSEC operational practices.\n"
- title: 8.2.  Security Considerations for MIH Transport
  contents:
  - "8.2.  Security Considerations for MIH Transport\n   The communication between\
    \ an MN and a Mobility Server is exposed to a\n   number of security threats:\n\
    \   o  Mobility Server identity spoofing.  A fake Mobility Server could\n    \
    \  provide the MNs with bogus data and force them to select the wrong\n      network\
    \ or to make a wrong handover decision.\n   o  Tampering.  Tampering with the\
    \ information provided by a Mobility\n      Server may result in the MN making\
    \ wrong network selection or\n      handover decisions.\n   o  Replay attack.\
    \  Since Mobility Services as defined in [IEEE80221]\n      support a 'PUSH model',\
    \ they can send large amounts of data to the\n      MNs whenever the Mobility\
    \ Server thinks that the data is relevant\n      for the MN.  An attacker may\
    \ intercept the data sent by the\n      Mobility Server to the MNs and replay\
    \ it at a later time, causing\n      the MNs to make network selection or handover\
    \ decisions that are\n      not valid at that point in time.\n   o  Eavesdropping.\
    \  By snooping the communication between an MN and a\n      Mobility Server, an\
    \ attacker may be able to trace a user's\n      movement between networks or cells,\
    \ or predict future movements,\n      by inspecting handover service messages.\n\
    \   There are many deployment-specific system security solutions\n   available,\
    \ which can be used to countermeasure the above mentioned\n   threats.  For example,\
    \ for the MoSh and MoSv scenarios (including\n   roaming scenarios), link layer\
    \ security may be sufficient to protect\n   the communication between the MN and\
    \ Mobility Server.  This is a\n   typical mobile operator environment where link\
    \ layer security\n   provides authentication, data confidentiality, and integrity.\
    \  In\n   other scenarios, such as the third-party MoS, link layer security\n\
    \   solutions may not be sufficient to protect the communication path\n   between\
    \ the MN and the Mobility Server.  The communication channel\n   between MN and\
    \ Mobility Server needs to be secured by other means.\n   The present document\
    \ does not provide any specific guidelines about\n   the way these security solutions\
    \ should be deployed.  However, if in\n   the future the IEEE 802.21 Working Group\
    \ amends the specification\n   with MIH protocol level security or recommends\
    \ the deployment\n   scenarios, IETF may revisit the security considerations and\
    \ recommend\n   specific transport-layer security as appropriate.\n"
