  - "Abstract\n   This document discusses the issues associated with mobility\n  \
    \ management for dual stack mobile nodes.  Currently, two mobility\n   management\
    \ protocols are defined for IPv4 and IPv6.  Deploying both\n   in a dual stack\
    \ mobile node introduces a number of problems.\n   Deployment and operational\
    \ issues motivate the use of a single\n   mobility management protocol.  This\
    \ document discusses such\n   motivations.  The document also discusses requirements\
    \ for the Mobile\n   IPv4 (MIPv4) and Mobile IPv6 (MIPv6) protocol so that they\
    \ can\n   support mobility management for a dual stack node.\n"

- title: 1.  Terminology
  contents:
  - "1.  Terminology\n   This document uses the following terms as defined in Stateless\
    \ IP/\n   ICMP Translation (SIIT) [RFC2765]: IPv4-capable node, IPv4-enabled\n\
    \   node, IPv6-capable node, IPv6-enabled node.\n   The following terms are introduced\
    \ in this document:\n   - MIPv4-capable node:\n      A node that supports MIPv4\
    \ [RFC3344] in its implementation.  This\n      allows the mobile node to configure\
    \ a home address (statically or\n      dynamically) and use such address in its\
    \ Mobile IPv4 signaling.  A\n      MIPv4-capable node may also be IPv6-capable\
    \ or IPv6-enabled and\n      must be IPv4-capable.\n   - MIPv6-capable node:\n\
    \      A node that supports MIPv6 [RFC3775] by configuring a home address\n  \
    \    and using such address in its Mobile IPv6 signaling.  A MIPv6-\n      enabled\
    \ node may also be IPv4-capable or IPv4-enabled and must be\n      IPv6-capable.\n"
- title: 2.  Introduction and Motivation
  contents:
  - "2.  Introduction and Motivation\n   A MIPv4-capable node can use Mobile IPv4\
    \ [RFC3344] to maintain\n   connectivity while moving between IPv4 subnets.  Similarly,\
    \ a MIPv6-\n   capable node can use Mobile IPv6 [RFC3775] to maintain connectivity\n\
    \   while moving between IPv6 subnets.\n   One of the ways of migrating to IPv6\
    \ is to deploy nodes that are both\n   IPv4 and IPv6 capable.  Such nodes will\
    \ be able to get both IPv4 and\n   IPv6 addresses and thus can communicate with\
    \ the current IPv4\n   Internet as well as any IPv6 nodes and networks as they\
    \ become\n   available.\n   A node that is both IPv4 and IPv6 capable can use\
    \ Mobile IPv4 for its\n   IPv4 stack and Mobile IPv6 for its IPv6 stack so that\
    \ it can move\n   between IPv4 and IPv6 subnets.  While this is possible, it does\
    \ not\n   ensure connectivity since that also depends on the IP version support\n\
    \   of the network accessed.  Supporting Mobile IPv4 and Mobile IPv6 is\n   also\
    \ more inefficient since it requires:\n   -  Mobile nodes to be both MIPv4 and\
    \ MIPv6 capable.\n   -  Mobile nodes to send two sets of signaling messages on\
    \ every\n      handoff.\n   -  Network Administrators to run and maintain two\
    \ sets of mobility\n      management systems on the same network, with each of\
    \ these systems\n      requiring its own set of optimizations.\n   This document\
    \ discusses the potential inefficiencies, IP connectivity\n   problems, and operational\
    \ issues that are evident when running both\n   mobility management protocols\
    \ simultaneously.  It also proposes a\n   work area to be taken up by the IETF\
    \ on the subject and discusses\n   requirements for appropriate solutions.\n"
- title: 3.  Problem Description
  contents:
  - "3.  Problem Description\n   Mobile IP (v4 and v6) uses a signaling protocol (Registration\n\
    \   requests in MIPv4 [RFC3344] and Binding updates in MIPv6 [RFC3775])\n   to\
    \ set up tunnels between two end points.  At the moment, Mobile IP\n   signaling\
    \ is tightly coupled to the address family (i.e., IPv4 or\n   IPv6) used, in the\
    \ connections it attempts to manipulate.  There are\n   no fundamental technical\
    \ reasons for such coupling.  If Mobile IP\n   were viewed as a tunnel-setup protocol,\
    \ it should be able to set up\n   IP in IP tunnels, independently of the IP version\
    \ used in the outer\n   and inner headers.  Other protocols -- for example, SIP\
    \ [RFC3261] --\n   are able to use either an IPv4- or IPv6-based signaling plane\
    \ to\n   manipulate IPv4 and IPv6 connections.\n   A node that is both MIPv4 and\
    \ MIPv6 capable, will require the\n   following to roam within the Internet:\n\
    \   -  The network operator needs to ensure that the home agent supports\n   \
    \   both protocols or that it has two separate Home Agents supporting\n      the\
    \ two protocols, each requiring its own management.\n   -  Double the amount of\
    \ configuration in the mobile node and the home\n      agent (e.g., security associations).\n\
    \   -  IP-layer local network optimizations for handovers will also need\n   \
    \   to be duplicated.\n   We argue that all of the above will make the deployment\
    \ of Mobile\n   IPv6, as well as any dual stack solution in a mobile environment,\n\
    \   harder.  We will discuss some of the issues with the current approach\n  \
    \ separately in the following sections.\n"
- title: 3.1.  The Impossibility of Maintaining IP Connectivity
  contents:
  - "3.1.  The Impossibility of Maintaining IP Connectivity\n   Even if a mobile node\
    \ is both MIPv4 and MIPv6 capable, connectivity\n   across different networks\
    \ would not, in fact, be guaranteed since\n   that also depends on the IPv4/IPv6\
    \ capabilities of the networks the\n   mobile is visiting; i.e., a node attempting\
    \ to connect via a IPv4-\n   only network would not be able to maintain connectivity\
    \ of its IPv6\n   applications and vice versa.  This is potentially the most serious\n\
    \   problem discussed in this document.\n"
- title: 3.2.  Implementation Burdens
  contents:
  - "3.2.  Implementation Burdens\n   As mentioned above, a node that is IPv4 and\
    \ IPv6 capable must also be\n   MIPv4 and MIPv6 capable to roam within the Internet.\
    \  The ability to\n   employ both IP versions from one mobility protocol makes\
    \ it possible\n   to implement just that one protocol, assuming the protocol choice\
    \ is\n   known.  However, in situations where the mobile node must be capable\n\
    \   of working in any network, it may still need two protocols.\n"
- title: 3.3.  Operational Burdens
  contents:
  - "3.3.  Operational Burdens\n   As mentioned earlier, deploying both protocols\
    \ will require managing\n   both protocols in the mobile node and the home agent.\
    \  This adds\n   significant operational issues for the network operator.  It\
    \ would\n   certainly require the network operator to have deep knowledge in both\n\
    \   protocols, which is something an operator may not be able to justify\n   due\
    \ to the lack of substantial gains.\n   In addition, deploying both protocols\
    \ will require duplication of\n   security credentials on mobile nodes and home\
    \ agents.  This includes\n   IPsec security associations, keying material, and\
    \ new authentication\n   protocols for Mobile IPv6, in addition to the security\
    \ credentials\n   and associations required by Mobile IPv4.  Depending on the\
    \ security\n   mechanisms used and with some further work, it might be possible\
    \ to\n   rely on one set of common credentials.  Assuming nothing else\n   changes,\
    \ however, such duplication is again significant with no gain\n   to the operator\
    \ or the mobile node.\n"
- title: 3.4.  Mobility Management Inefficiencies
  contents:
  - "3.4.  Mobility Management Inefficiencies\n   Suppose that a mobile node is moving\
    \ within a dual stack access\n   network.  Every time the mobile node moves, it\
    \ needs to send two\n   mobile IP messages to its home agent to allow its IPv4\
    \ and IPv6\n   connections to survive.  There is no reason for such duplication.\
    \  If\n   local mobility optimizations were deployed (e.g., Hierarchical Mobile\n\
    \   IPv6 (HMIPv6) [RFC4140], Fast handovers for Mobile IPv4 [RFC4068]),\n   the\
    \ mobile node will need to update the local agents running each\n   protocol.\
    \  Ironically, one local agent might be running both HMIPv6\n   and local MIPv4\
    \ home agent.  Clearly, it is not desirable to have to\n   send two messages and\
    \ complete two sets of transactions for the same\n   fundamental optimization.\n\
    \   Hence, such parallel operation of Mobile IPv4 and Mobile IPv6 will\n   complicate\
    \ mobility management within the Internet and increase the\n   amount of bandwidth\
    \ needed at the critical handover time for no\n   apparent gain.\n"
- title: 3.5.  IPv4 to IPv6 Transition Mechanisms
  contents:
  - "3.5.  IPv4 to IPv6 Transition Mechanisms\n   The IETF has standardized a number\
    \ of transition mechanisms to allow\n   networks and end nodes to gain IPv6 connectivity\
    \ while the Internet\n   is migrating from IPv4 to IPv6.  However, while some\
    \ transition\n   mechanisms can be combined with Mobile IPv4 or Mobile IPv6, none\
    \ of\n   the known mechanisms have been shown to assist with the issues\n   described\
    \ in this document.\n"
- title: 4.  Conclusions and Recommendations
  contents:
  - "4.  Conclusions and Recommendations\n   The points above highlight the tight\
    \ coupling in both Mobile IPv4 and\n   Mobile IPv6 between signaling and the IP\
    \ addresses used by upper\n   layers.  Given that Mobile IPv4 is currently deployed\
    \ and Mobile IPv6\n   is expected to be deployed, there is a need for gradual\
    \ transition\n   from IPv4 mobility management to IPv6.  Running both protocols\n\
    \   simultaneously is inefficient and has the problems described above.\n   The\
    \ gradual transition can be done when needed or deemed appropriate\n   by operators\
    \ or implementers.  In the meantime, it is important to\n   ensure that the problems\
    \ listed above can be avoided.  Hence, this\n   section lists some actions that\
    \ should be taken by the IETF to\n   address the problems listed above, without\
    \ mandating the use of two\n   mobility management protocols simultaneously.\n\
    \   The Mobile IPv6 Working Group has reached the view that to allow for\n   a\
    \ gradual transition based on current standards and deployment, the\n   following\
    \ work areas would be reasonable:\n   -  It should be possible to run one mobility\
    \ management protocol that\n      can manage mobility for both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses\
    \ used by upper\n      layers.  Both Mobile IPv4 and Mobile IPv6 should be able\
    \ to\n      perform such tasks.  It may not be possible to support route\n   \
    \   optimization for Mobile IPv6 in all cases; however, mobility\n      management\
    \ and session continuity can be supported.\n   -  It should be possible to create\
    \ IPv4 extensions to Mobile IPv6 so\n      that an IPv4 and IPv6 capable mobile\
    \ node can register its IPv4\n      and IPv6 home addresses to an IPv4- and IPv6-enabled\
    \ Home Agent\n      using MIPv6 signaling only.\n   -  It should be possible to\
    \ create IPv6 extensions to Mobile IPv4 so\n      that an IPv4 and IPv6 capable\
    \ mobile node can register its IPv4\n      and IPv6 home addresses to an IPv4-\
    \ and IPv6-enabled Home Agent\n      using Mobile IPv4 signaling only.\n   - \
    \ It should also be possible to extend MIPv4 [RFC3344] and MIPv6\n      [RFC3775]\
    \ so that a mobile node can register a single care-of\n      address (IPv4 or\
    \ IPv6) to which IPv4 and/or IPv6 packets can be\n      tunneled.\n   If the IETF\
    \ chooses to pursue all these paths, a vendor could choose\n   to support one\
    \ mobility management protocol while avoiding the\n   incompatibility and inefficiency\
    \ problems listed in this document.\n   Similarly, operators could decide to continue\
    \ using one mobility\n   management protocol throughout the period of IPv4 and\
    \ IPv6\n   coexistence.  However, a mobile node would be forced to choose one\n\
    \   approach or the other, or nevertheless to install both and use one or\n  \
    \ the other according to circumstances.\n"
