  - "1.  Introduction\n   \"IETF Working Group Guidelines and Procedures\" [RFC2418]\
    \ describes\n   the Working Group formation process within the Internet Engineering\n\
    \   Task Force (IETF).  As noted in RFC 2418 [RFC2418] Section 2.1:\n      When\
    \ determining whether it is appropriate to create a working\n      group, the\
    \ Area Director(s) and the IESG will consider several\n      issues:\n      -\
    \ Are the issues that the working group plans to address clear and\n        relevant\
    \ to the Internet community?\n      - Are the goals specific and reasonably achievable,\
    \ and achievable\n        within a reasonable time frame?\n      - What are the\
    \ risks and urgency of the work, to determine the\n        level of effort required?\n\
    \      - Do the working group's activities overlap with those of another\n   \
    \     working group?\n        ...\n      - Is there sufficient interest within\
    \ the IETF in the working\n        group's topic with enough people willing to\
    \ expend the effort to\n        produce the desired result (e.g., a protocol specification)?\n\
    \        ...\n      - Is there enough expertise within the IETF in the working\
    \ group's\n        topic, and are those people interested in contributing in the\n\
    \        working group?\n        ...\n      - Does a base of interested consumers\
    \ (end-users) appear to exist\n        for the planned work?\n        ...\n  \
    \    - Does the IETF have a reasonable role to play in the\n        determination\
    \ of the technology?\n        ...\n      - Are all known intellectual property\
    \ rights relevant to the\n        proposed working group's efforts issues understood?\n\
    \      - Is the proposed work plan an open IETF effort or is it an\n        attempt\
    \ to \"bless\" non-IETF technology where the effect of input\n        from IETF\
    \ participants may be limited?\n      - Is there a good understanding of any existing\
    \ work that is\n        relevant to the topics that the proposed working group\
    \ is to\n        pursue?  This includes work within the IETF and elsewhere.\n\
    \      - Do the working group's goals overlap with known work in another\n   \
    \     standards body, and if so is adequate liaison in place?\n   In some situations,\
    \ while interest on the part of IETF participants\n   and end-users may be evident,\
    \ and the relevance to the Internet\n   community may be demonstrated, the answer\
    \ to other questions (such as\n   an understanding of existing work, clarity or\
    \ achievability of goals,\n   or overlap with existing working groups or standards\
    \ bodies) may not\n   be as clear.  In the past, the likely outcome in this circumstance\n\
    \   has been to postpone Working Group formation or even Birds of a\n   Feather\
    \ (BOF) sessions until satisfactory answers are forthcoming.\n   However, in practice\
    \ this may leave the status of the potential\n   Working Group officially undetermined\
    \ for months or even years.\n   While the Area Directors should provide potential\
    \ Working Group\n   participants timely updates on the status of the potential\
    \ Working\n   Group and insight into IESG or IAB concerns, currently there is\
    \ no\n   mechanism to track progress toward Working Group creation, and as a\n\
    \   result, participants may not have a clear understanding of the status\n  \
    \ or the next steps.  Also, the lack of formal recognition may\n   negatively\
    \ affect the motivation of the participants, and may leave\n   those who have\
    \ not followed the effort closely with an impression\n   that no work is going\
    \ on.\n   This document describes an RFC 3933 [RFC3933] experiment in the\n  \
    \ Working Group (WG) formation process, known as the Exploratory Group\n   (EG).\
    \  Exploratory Group milestones are focused on completion of\n   prerequisites\
    \ for Working Group formation, and as a result they are\n   expected to conclude\
    \ within a short time frame, with limited\n   opportunities for milestone extension.\n\
    \   This Exploratory Group experiment does not alter the Working Group\n   formation\
    \ guidelines described in RFC 2418 [RFC2418] Section 2.1, or\n   the Internet\
    \ Standards Process described in RFC 2026 [RFC2026].\n   Rather, it builds on\
    \ these existing processes, introducing an element\n   of formality which may\
    \ be useful in clarifying IESG and/or IAB\n   concerns relating to Working Group\
    \ formation criteria and motivating\n   more rapid progress toward their resolution.\
    \  Since Exploratory Group\n   documents (including the EG Charter and potential\
    \ WG Charter) are\n   reviewed and comments are tracked using existing tools and\
    \ processes,\n   feedback is available to Exploratory Group chairs and authors,\n\
    \   providing for transparency and accountability.\n"

- title: 2.  Exploratory Group Formation
  contents:
  - "2.  Exploratory Group Formation\n   If at any point during the Working Group\
    \ formation process, relevance\n   to the Internet community and interest within\
    \ the IETF and end-user\n   community has been demonstrated, but one or more Working\
    \ Group\n   formation criteria outlined in RFC 2418 [RFC2418] Section 2.1 has\
    \ not\n   yet been met, the IESG MAY propose that an Exploratory Group be\n  \
    \ formed.  Exploratory Groups MAY be created as the first step toward\n   Working\
    \ Group formation, or as an intermediate step between an\n   initial Birds of\
    \ a Feather (BOF) session and Working Group creation.\n   The formation of an\
    \ Exploratory Group after a second BOF is NOT\n   RECOMMENDED.\n   Since the goal\
    \ of an Exploratory Group is to put in place the\n   prerequisites for formation\
    \ of a Working Group more rapidly than\n   might otherwise be possible, Exploratory\
    \ Groups SHOULD initially be\n   chartered for a period of six months to twelve\
    \ months, with six\n   months being the default.  While the IESG MAY extend the\
    \ initial\n   Exploratory Group milestones by an additional six months, extensions\n\
    \   beyond this are NOT RECOMMENDED.  The Exploratory Group Charter\n   SHOULD\
    \ include at least the following \"basic milestones\":\n      o Development of\
    \ a Working Group Charter.\n      o Development of a document demonstrating fulfillment\
    \ of the\n        Working Group formation criteria described in RFC 2418 [RFC2418]\n\
    \        Section 2.1.\n   The IESG MAY also include additional milestones within\
    \ an Exploratory\n   Group charter (such as development of a problem statement\
    \ or\n   requirements document and/or completion of a review of the literature\n\
    \   or current practices), as long as these additional milestones do not\n   compromise\
    \ the ability of the Exploratory Group to deliver on the\n   basic milestones\
    \ in a timely way.  A Exploratory Group charter MUST\n   NOT include milestones\
    \ relating to development of standards track\n   documents or protocol specifications.\n\
    \   Since the Exploratory Group experiment is not intended as a\n   substitute\
    \ for the existing Working Group formation process,\n   Exploratory Groups SHOULD\
    \ be formed only in situations where the\n   prerequisites for formation of a\
    \ WG are likely to be met if the EG\n   successfully completes the basic milestones.\n"
- title: 3.  The Experiment
  contents:
  - "3.  The Experiment\n   This experiment runs for a period of 18 months from IESG\
    \ approval of\n   the experiment.  During the period of the experiment, the IESG\
    \ MAY\n   approve formation of as many as three Exploratory Groups.  The IESG\n\
    \   MUST inform the community in a public statement of any decisions for\n   Exploratory\
    \ Group formation approved under this experiment.  Such a\n   statement SHOULD\
    \ include a description of specific Exploratory Group\n   that was formed.\n \
    \  Given that this is an experiment, the intent is for Exploratory\n   Groups\
    \ to be handled identically to Working Groups in terms of IETF\n   process, tools\
    \ and infrastructure; no additional burden is to be\n   imposed on the IETF Secretariat.\
    \  Other than the abbreviated\n   Exploratory Group charter, the process for formation\
    \ of an\n   Exploratory Group is identical to that of a Working Group, including\n\
    \   review by the IAB and IESG, announcement of the potential Exploratory\n  \
    \ Group, and request for review by the IETF community.  The operating\n   rules\
    \ of an Exploratory Group (openness, meeting requirements, etc.)\n   are identical\
    \ to Working Groups.  From the point of view of IETF\n   infrastructure (tools,\
    \ membership in the WGCHAIRS mailing list,\n   process rules, Exploratory Group\
    \ Charter pages, etc.)  Exploratory\n   Groups are treated identically to Working\
    \ Groups, with the exception\n   that Exploratory Group names should include \"\
    EG\" within the name\n   (e.g. \"EXAMPLEEG\"), so as to clearly differentiate\
    \ them from Working\n   Groups.\n   Review of Exploratory Group documents will\
    \ utilize the same tracking\n   tools and processes (including PROTO shepherding)\
    \ as other IETF\n   documents; this allows feedback to be viewed by Exploratory\
    \ Group\n   Chairs and participants, as well as providing additional clarity on\n\
    \   next steps.  Formation of an Exploratory Group requires the\n   appointment\
    \ of an Exploratory Group Chair, and a well defined set of\n   Working Group formation\
    \ criteria (agreement on the Working Group\n   Charter, review of the formation\
    \ criteria, problem statement or\n   requirements document, etc.).\n"
- title: 3.1.  Success Metrics
  contents:
  - "3.1.  Success Metrics\n   Since one of the goals of this experiment is to enable\
    \ the more rapid\n   formation of Working Groups, the success of an individual\
    \ Exploratory\n   Group, as well as the experiment, can be measured based on the\n\
    \   progress made toward Working Group formation.  Useful metrics\n   include:\n\
    \   Progress on Basic Milestones\n        A Exploratory Group that does not make\
    \ progress on its basic\n        milestones cannot be judged successful, regardless\
    \ of its other\n        achievements, such as progress on a literature review\
    \ or\n        requirements document.  Progress on the basic milestones is\n  \
    \      measured by whether they are completed within the time-frame\n        specified\
    \ in the initial Exploratory Group Charter, and whether\n        feedback from\
    \ the IESG, IAB and IETF community is positive,\n        leading the IESG to vote\
    \ to form a Working Group.\n   Mailing List Activity\n        Since one of the\
    \ goals of the Exploratory Group experiment is to\n        avoid a potential loss\
    \ of interest among participants, evidence\n        of continued engagement on\
    \ the part of Exploratory Group\n        participants based on mailing list activity\
    \ is a potential\n        success metric.  Conversely, an Exploratory Group whose\
    \ mailing\n        list shows minimal traffic would probably not be a good\n \
    \       candidate for milestone extension.\n"
