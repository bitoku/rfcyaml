- title: Abstract
  contents:
  - "Abstract\n   This memo defines a new Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) [1]\n\
    \   reply code, 521, which one may use to indicate that an Internet host\n   does\
    \ not accept incoming mail.\n"
- title: 1. Motivations
  contents:
  - "1. Motivations\n   Hosts on the Internet have shifted from large, general-purpose\
    \ hosts\n   to smaller, more specialized hosts.  There is an increasing number\
    \ of\n   hosts which are dedicated to specific tasks, such as serving NTP or\n\
    \   DNS.  These dedicated hosts frequently do not provide mail service.\n   Usually,\
    \ these mailless hosts do not run an SMTP server.\n   Unfortunately, users will\
    \ occasionally misaddress mail to these\n   hosts.  Regular SMTP clients attempting\
    \ to deliver this misaddressed\n   mail must treat the lack of an SMTP server\
    \ on the host as a temporary\n   error.  They must queue the mail for later delivery,\
    \ should an SMTP\n   server be started at a later time.\n   This causes the mail\
    \ to remain queued for days, until it is returned\n   with what is usually a confusing\
    \ error message.\n"
- title: 2. Two  complementary solutions
  contents:
  - "2. Two  complementary solutions\n   Two complementary solutions MAY be implemented\
    \ to deal with this\n   issue.  The first one is to use MX relays to bounce misaddressed\n\
    \   mails.  The second one is to implement a  minimal smtp server on the\n   mailless\
    \ host to bounce all mails.\n   The choice between the two solutions is site dependent.\n"
- title: 3. The MX relays solution
  contents:
  - "3. The MX relays solution\n   MX relays may be used to indicate SMTP clients\
    \ that an Internet host\n   does not accept mail.\n   During the SMTP dialog,\
    \ these MX relays MAY bounce any message\n   destinated to this particular host\
    \ with an SMTP 521 reply code.\n   SMTP dialog example:\n   ---> 220 relay.imag.fr\
    \ ready\n   <--- HELO client.inria.fr\n   ---> 250 relay.imag.fr Hello client.inria.fr\n\
    \   <--- MAIL FROM: <user1@client.inria.fr>\n   ---> 250 <user1@client.inria.fr>...\
    \ Sender Ok\n   <--- RCPT TO: <user2@nomail.imag.fr>\n   ---> 521 nomail.imag.fr\
    \ does not accept mail\n   <--- QUIT\n   ---> 221 relay.imag.fr closing connection\n\
    \   If an MX relay of precedence n for a mailless host bounces mails on\n   its\
    \ behalf, then any other MX relay of precedence lower than n for\n   this mailless\
    \ host SHOULD do the same.\n"

- title: 4.1 521 greeting
  contents:
  - "4.1 521 greeting\n   A host may indicate that it does not accept mail by sending\
    \ an\n   initial 521 \"Host does not accept mail\" reply to an incoming SMTP\n\
    \   connection.  The official name of the server host or its IP address\n   MUST\
    \ be sent as the first word following the reply code.\n   For example: 521 canon.inria.fr\
    \ does not accept mail\n"
- title: 4.2 SMTP dialog
  contents:
  - "4.2 SMTP dialog\n   After issuing the initial 521 reply, the server host MUST\
    \ do one of\n   the following two options:\n   a) Close the SMTP connection.\n\
    \   b) Read commands, issuing 521 replies to all commands except QUIT.\n     \
    \ If the SMTP client does not issue the QUIT command after a\n      reasonable\
    \ time, the SMTP server MUST time out and close the\n      connection.  A suggested\
    \ time-out value is 5 minutes.\n   DISCUSSION:\n   When an SMTP server closes\
    \ the connection immediatly after issuing\n   the initial 521 reply, some existing\
    \ SMTP clients treat the\n   condition as a transient error and requeue the mail\
    \ for later\n   delivery.  If the SMTP server leaves the connection open, those\n\
    \   clients immediately send the QUIT command and return the mail.\n"
- title: 4.3 MX
  contents:
  - "4.3 MX\n   A host which sends a 521 greeting message MUST NOT be listed as an\
    \ MX\n   record for any domain.\n"
- title: 4.4 Postmaster
  contents:
  - "4.4 Postmaster\n   An SMTP server which sends a 521 greeting message IS NOT subject\
    \ to\n   the postmaster requirement of STD 3, RFC 1123 ([2]).\n   DISCUSSION:\n\
    \   Postmaster exists so you can report mail errors.  A host that doesn't\n  \
    \ support mail doesn't need a Postmaster.\n"
- title: 5. SMTP client behavior
  contents:
  - "5. SMTP client behavior\n   If an SMTP client encounters a host in an MX record\
    \ that issues a 521\n   greeting message, it must do one of the following two\
    \ options:\n   a) Attempt to deliver it to a different MX host for that domain.\n\
    \   b) Return the mail with an appropriate non-delivery report.\n   If an SMTP\
    \ client encounters a 521 reply code in any other part of\n   the SMTP dialog,\
    \ it MUST return the mail with an appropriate non-\n   delivery report.\n"
- title: 6. Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "6. Security Considerations\n   Not running any SMTP server, or running an SMTP\
    \ server which simply\n   emits fixed strings in response to incoming connection\
    \ should provide\n   significantly fewer opportunities for security problems than\
    \ running\n   a complete SMTP implementation.\n"
