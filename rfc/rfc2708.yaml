    \   The Job Monitoring MIB [JobMIB] is intended to be implemented in a\n   device\
    \ or server that supports any job submission protocol.  However,\n   the information\
    \ available and the method of presentation varies\n   significantly by job submission\
    \ protocol.  A common method of mapping\n   job submission information to the\
    \ Job Monitoring MIB is essential for\n   interoperability of Job MIB agents and\
    \ monitoring applications.  This\n   document defines recommended mappings for\
    \ most popular job submission\n   protocols to ensure this compatibility.\n  \
    \ All mappings are unidirectional from the job submission protocol to\n   the\
    \ MIB.  It is assumed that support of the job submission protocol\n   in the printer\
    \ implies that the reverse information flow is presently\n   defined and does\
    \ not require interaction from the MIB.  This mapping\n   is not defined in this\
    \ document as it should be obvious.\n   This document refers to system configurations\
    \ that are defined in the\n   Job Monitoring MIB [JobMIB].  For those readers\
    \ that are familiar\n   with the configuration descriptions, a short summary appears\
    \ here.\n   Please see the Job MIB document for further details.\n   Configuration\
    \ 1:  This is a simple peer-to-peer system which contains\n                  \
    \   only a client and a printer.  The Job MIB agent is\n                     resident\
    \ in the printer.\n   Configuration 2:  This system contains a client, server,\
    \ and a\n                     printer.  The Jib MIB agent is resident in the\n\
    \                     server.\n   Configuration 3:  This system, as in configuration\
    \ 2, contains a\n                     client, server, and a printer.  In this\
    \ case the\n                     Job MIB agent is implemented within the printer.\n\
    \   The most important object to be mapped is jmJobSubmissionID, since\n   this\
    \ is a method for the user or client to determine the jmJobIndex\n   for a submitted\
    \ job.  Therefore, jmJobSubmissionID is specified for\n   all job submission protocols\
    \ defined in this document.  The remaining\n   objects mapped include only those\
    \ items that have the equivalent\n   information presented to the printer by the\
    \ job submission protocol.\n   While this document places a strong emphasis on\
    \ jmJobSubmissionID\n   mapping to obtain jmJobIndex, the preferred method is\
    \ through the use\n   of a bi-directional job submission protocol that returns\
    \ the\n   equivalent value of jmJobIndex to the client, such as IPP.  When a\n\
    \   bi-directional protocol that returns jmJobIndex is in use, the\n   jmJobSubmissionID\
    \ object has no value to the client.  When the\n   jmJobIndex cannot be returned,\
    \ the use of a client defined\n   jmJobSubmissionID is preferred over an agent\
    \ derived value.  The\n   client defined version allows for retrieval of jmJobIndex\
    \ using a\n   single SNMP Get operation, since jmJobSubmissionID is the index\
    \ into\n   the jmJobIDTable.  An agent derived value will require a search\n \
    \  through multiple entries in the jmJobIDTable.\n   The majority of the protocols\
    \ mapped in this document are oriented\n   towards network job submission.  However,\
    \ the Job Monitoring MIB is\n   also intended to monitor print jobs received from\
    \ other than network\n   ports, such as parallel and serial ports.  Some of the\
    \ job submission\n   protocols included that are used with non-networked ports\
    \ are PJL,\n   PostScript, and TIP/SI.  In addition, the Job Monitoring MIB can\
    \ be\n   used with print jobs that are internally generated, such as self test\n\
    \   pages.  In this latter case, no mapping is required since all job\n   submission\
    \ protocols are bypassed.\n2.0  LINE PRINTER DAEMON (LPR/LPD) PROTOCOL\n   The\
    \ LPR/LPD printing protocol [LPD] is used with BSD UNIX systems in\n   the client-server-printer\
    \ configuration.  Usage of the Job Monitoring\n   MIB with LPR/LPD will most likely\
    \ conform to Configuration 3, where\n   the monitor application or the server\
    \ uses SNMP to obtain job\n   information from the printer.  The client communicates\
    \ with the UNIX\n   server using the existing LPD protocol to obtain job information.\n\
    \   The LPR/LPD protocol is also used in the Windows environment to\n   implement\
    \ peer-to-peer printing, as shown in configuration 1.  In\n   this case, SNMP\
    \ is used by the client and/or the monitor application\n   to obtain the job information.\n\
    \   One of the major problems of LPR/LPD is the large number of vendor\n   unique\
    \ extensions currently used with the protocol and the resulting\n   compatibility\
    \ issues between available implementations.  To avoid\n   these issues, this mapping\
    \ of LPR/LPD is restricted to the protocol\n   as defined by RFC 1179.\n   The\
    \ LPR/LPD protocol transfers print job data and control information\n   in separate\
    \ files, known as the Data File and Control File,\n   respectively.  Most of the\
    \ information concerning the print job is\n   contained in the Control File. \
    \ In many LPD implementations, the\n   Control File is transferred following the\
    \ Data File.  Thus much of\n   the information concerning the job may not be available\
    \ until the\n   completion of the data transmission.\n2.1  jmJobSubmissionID Mapped\
    \ to LPR/LPD\n   The LPR/LPD Receive Data File command contains a parameter which\n\
    \   defines the name of the data file.  This name field is structured as\n   follows:\n\
    \      dfaXXX<host-name>  or  daXXXX<host-name>\n   Where XXX or XXXX is the numeric\
    \ job number assigned by the network\n   entity submitting the print job to the\
    \ printer.  The recommended\n   mapping of this name field to jmJobSubmissionID\
    \ is:\n   octet 1:   '9'\n   octets 2-40:  Contains the <host-name> portion of\
    \ the name field.  If\n                 the <host-name> portion is less than 40\
    \ octets, the\n                 left-most character in the string shall appear\
    \ in octet\n                 position 2.  Any unused portion of this field shall\
    \ be\n                 filled with spaces.  Otherwise, only the last 39 bytes\n\
    \                 shall be included.\n   octets 41-48:  '00000XXX' or '0000XXXX',\
    \ where XXX or XXXX is the\n               decimal (ASCII coded) representation\
    \ of the LPR/LPD job\n               number.\n2.2  jmJobIndex Mapped to LPR/LPD\n\
    \   The job index (jmJobIndex) is assigned by the SNMP job monitoring\n   agent\
    \ and is independent of the XXX (or XXXX) index assigned by the\n   LPR/LPD client.\
    \  This will allow the SNMP agent to track jobs\n   received from multiple sources.\n\
    2.3  Other MIB Objects Mapped to LPR/LPD\nMIB Object                    | LPR/LPD\

    \ attributes that are applicable, but not defined in this section\n   such as\
    \ attributes that map to a vendor unique extension, may also be\n   included.\n\

    \ Source File Name (notes 1, 3)   | Octet String\nNotes:\n------\n   1. The information\
    \ is optional in the Control File.  The attribute\n      should be included if\
    \ present in the Control File.\n   2. Control file command code = J.  If this\
    \ optional field is omitted\n      from the control file, then the agent returns\
    \ the file name\n      (command code = N), if present.\n   3. Control file command\
    \ code = N.\n3.0  APPLETALK PROTOCOL\n   AppleTalk was originally developed as\
    \ a peer-to-peer network\n   protocol, as described in configuration 1, for use\
    \ with Apple\n   Macintosh computers.  Today, print spoolers are also available\
    \ for\n   use with Macintosh computer networks that conform to configurations\n\
    \   2/3.  In addition, printing with the AppleTalk protocol is supported\n   from\
    \ both Windows NT servers and Novell servers also per\n   configurations 2/3.\n\
    \   The AppleTalk protocol provides very little information that can be\n   used\
    \ with the Job Monitoring MIB.  The Macintosh print drivers are\n   able to provide\
    \ information concerning the user and document name but\n   imbed this information\
    \ in the PDL, which is typically PostScript.\n   The preferred jmJobSubmissionID\
    \ is constructed from the information\n   in the PostScript file, as defined in\
    \ section 9.0.\n3.1  jmJobSubmissionID Mapped to AppleTalk\n   An alternative\
    \ jmJobSubmissionID may be constructed from the\n   Connection Identifier contained\
    \ in the AppleTalk Printer Access\n   Protocol (PAP) header.  Since the Connection\
    \ Id is not readily\n   available in any of the defined AppleTalk implementations,\
    \ this\n   approach may be of little utility.\n   octet 1:   'A'\n   octets 2-40:\
    \  Contains the AppleTalk printer name, with the first\n                 character\
    \ of the name in octet 2.  AppleTalk printer\n                 names are a maximum\
    \ of 31 characters.  Any unused\n                 portion of this field shall\
    \ be filled with spaces.\n   octets 41-48:  '00000XXX', where 'XXX' is the decimal\
    \ (ASCII coded)\n                  representation of the Connection Id.\n3.2 \
    \ Other AppleTalk Mappings\n   No other Job MIB objects or parameters can be derived\
    \ from\n   information available in the AppleTalk headers\n4.0  INTERNET PRINTING\
    \ PROTOCOL (IPP)\n   The Internet Printing Protocol [IPP] supports printing using\
    \ any one\n   of the three possible configurations.  For configuration 2, the\n\
    \   mapping defined herein is performed on an agent within the server.\n   Otherwise,\
    \ the mapping is performed on an agent within the printer.\n4.1  jmJobSubmissionID\
    \ Mapped to IPP\n   IPP contains a rich set of parameters which allow several\
    \ methods of\n   creating the jmJobSubmissionID object.  To prevent interoperability\n\
    \   problems, the preferred method is to use the IPP job-uri attribute as\n  \
    \ follows:\n   octet 1:   '4'\n   octets 2-40:  Contains the IPP job-uri job description\
    \ attribute\n                 generated by the printer.  (The job-uri is returned\
    \ to\n                 the client by IPP.)  If the job-uri is less than 40\n \
    \                octets, the left-most character in the string shall\n       \
    \          appear in octet position 2.  Any unused portion of this\n         \
    \        field shall be filled with spaces.  Otherwise, only the\n           \
    \      last 39 bytes shall be included.\n   octets 41-48:  Contains the decimal\
    \ (ASCII coded) representation of\n                  the job-id job description\
    \ attribute.  Leading zeros\n                  shall be inserted to fill the entire\
    \ 8 octet field.\n   NOTE - Since IPP returns the \"job-identifier\" attribute\
    \ with the\n   jmJobIndex value for a job when the job is submitted, the use of\
    \ the\n   jmJobSubmissionID table should not be needed by a management\n   application.\
    \  See Section 1.0.\n4.2  jmJobIndex Mapped to IPP\n   The job index (jmJobIndex)\
    \ assigned by the SNMP job monitoring agent\n   is returned to the client by IPP\
    \ as the job-id job description\n   attribute.  (Since IPP does not require consecutively\
    \ generated job-\n   ids, the agent may receive jobs from multiple clients and\
    \ can assign\n   jmJobIndex in an ascending sequence independent of the submitting\
    \ job\n   client.)  The IPP job-id must be restricted to the range of 1 to\n \
    \  99,999,999 (decimal) to allow the value to be properly represented in\n   jmJobSubmissionID.\n\

    \ job\n      state reasons.  Also the IPP \"job-state-reasons\" attribute is a\n\
    \      multi-valued attribute with each value being a keyword.  The IPP\n    \
    \  condition may change multiple bits in this object.  The IPP \"job-\n      state-reasons\"\
    \ attribute may also change one or more of the\n      jobStateReasonsN attributes\
    \ (see section 4.4).\n4.4  The Attribute Group Mapped to IPP\n   The following\

    \ from the IANA registry which is also\n      used in the Printer MIB.  The IPP\
    \ attributes-charset is the name\n      (MIME preferred name) of the character\
    \ set.\n   2. The Job MIB sides attribute uses the integer values \"1\" and \"\
    2\".\n      The IPP sides attribute uses three keywords.\n   3. jobStateReasonsN\
    \ are three attributes (N=2, 3, 4).  Also the IPP\n      \"job-state-reasons\"\
    \ attribute is a multi-valued attribute with\n      each value being a keyword.\
    \  The IPP condition may change multiple\n      bits in one or more of these Job\
    \ MIB attributes.  See also\n      jmJobStateReasons1 in section 4.3.\n   4. The\
    \ IPP \"copies\" attribute maps to the Job MIB:\n      (1) jobCopiesRequested\
    \ when the job has only one document OR IPP\n          \"multiple-document-handling\"\
    \ is 'single-valued'\n      (2) documentCopiesRequested, in which case the MIB\
    \ value is the\n          total number of document copies that the job will produce\

    \ IPDS datastream facilitates a close relationship between the\n   print supervisor\
    \ (Print Services Facility - PSF) and the printer.\n   There are PSF applications\
    \ for UNIX, Windows, OS/2, OS/400 and host\n   operating systems such as VM, MVS\
    \ and VSE. Together, PSF and IPDS\n   represent a complete, mature and robust\
    \ job management framework\n   which includes font and resource management, page\
    \ progress tracking,\n   job cancellation, complete error recovery and end-user\
    \ notification.\n   Because PSF and the printer correspond via the use of locally\n\
    \   assigned IDs, there is a limited amount of clear text information\n   provided\
    \ during submission for use by the Job MIB.\n5.1  jmJobSubmissionId Mapped to\

    \ PRINTING APPLICATION (DPA)\n   The ISO 10175 Document Printing Application (DPA)\
    \ [DPA] supports\n   printing using any one of the three possible configurations.\
    \  For\n   configuration 2, the mapping defined herein is performed on a server.\n\
    \   Otherwise, the mapping is performed on an agent within the printer.\n6.1 \
    \ jmJobSubmissionID Mapped to DPA\n   DPA contains a rich set of parameters which\
    \ allow several methods of\n   creating the jmJobSubmissionID object.  To prevent\
    \ interoperability\n   problems, the preferred method is to use the DPA job-owner\
    \ attribute\n   as follows:\n   octet 1:   '0'\n   octets 2-40:  Contains the\
    \ DPA job-owner attribute supplied by the\n                 submitter.  If the\
    \ job-owner is less than 40 octets,\n                 the left-most character\
    \ in the string shall appear in\n                 octet position 2.  Any unused\
    \ portion of this field\n                 shall be filled with spaces.  Otherwise,\
    \ only the last\n                 39 bytes shall be included.\n   octets 41-48:\
    \  Contains an 8-digit sequential decimal number.\n6.2  jmJobIndex Mapped to DPA\n\
    \   The job index (jmJobIndex) assigned by the SNMP job monitoring agent\n   is\
    \ returned to the client by DPA as a decimal digit string as the\n   value of\
    \ the DPA job-identifier attribute.  (Since DPA does not\n   require consecutively\
    \ generated job-identifiers, the agent may\n   receive jobs from multiple clients\
    \ and can assign the jmJobIndex in\n   an ascending sequence independent of the\
    \ submitting job client.)  The\n   DPA job-identifier must be restricted to the\
    \ range of 1 to 99,999,999\n   (decimal) to allow the value to be properly represented\
    \ in\n   jmJobSubmissionID.\n   NOTE - Since DPA returns the \"job-identifier\"\
    \ attribute with the\n   jmJobIndex value for a job when the job is submitted,\
    \ the use of the\n   jmJobSubmissionID table should not be needed by a management\n\
    \   application.  See Section 1.0.\n6.3  Other MIB Objects Mapped to DPA\n   MIB\

    \ for use in the Job\n   MIB.  The PJL JOB command is presented at the start of\
    \ a print job\n   with options that apply only the attached job.  The syntax for\
    \ this\n   command option is:\n      @PJL JOB SUBMISSIONID = \"id string\"\n \
    \  Driver software that implements this PJL command option must provide\n   the\
    \ \"id string\" in one of the client version formats specified in the\n   Job\
    \ MIB for jmJobSubmissionID.\n   For drivers that are not able to create the SUBMISSIONID\
    \ option, it\n   is recommended that jmJobSubmissionID format 0 be created by\
    \ the\n   agent using the PJL attribute DocOwner or DocOwnerId.\n   octet 1: \
    \  '0'\n   octets 2-40:  Contains the string associated with DocOwner or\n   \

    \ fields which can be used by\n   application drivers to include job information.\
    \  Although there are\n   no restrictions or requirements as to what information\
    \ may be\n   included, many drivers include job owner and/or document name.\n\
    9.1  jmJobSubmissionID Mapped to PostScript\n   The use of a standard format job\
    \ submission id comment string will\n   allow interoperability of printers and\
    \ drivers from multiple vendors.\n   The following comment string format is recommended\
    \ for use with\n   PostScript level 1 and level 2 data streams.\n      %%JMPJobSubmissionId:(id-string)\n\
    \   where \"id string\" can be any jmJobSubmissionID format reserved for\n   clients.\n\
    9.2  Other MIB Objects and Attributes Mapped to PostScript\n   No Other mappings\
    \ from PostScript comment strings are recommended,\n   but many Job MIB objects\
    \ and attributes can be defined using vendor\n   unique comment strings.\n10.0\
    \  NETWARE PSERVER\n   The NetWare PServer job submission protocol is implemented\
    \ in a\n   client- server-printer system on the server to printer link as\n  \
    \ defined in configuration 3.\n10.1  jmJobSubmissionID Mapped to PServer\n   octet\
    \ 1:   'B'\n   octets 2-40:  Contains the Directory Path Name of the agent as\n\
    \                 recorded by the Novell File Server in the queue\n          \
    \       directory.  If the string is less than 40 octets, the\n              \
    \   left-most character in the string shall appear in octet\n                \
    \ position 2.  Otherwise, only the last 39 bytes shall be\n                 included.\
    \  Any unused portion of this field shall be\n                 filled with spaces.\n\
    \   octets 41-48:  '000XXXXX'  The decimal (ASCII coded) representation\n    \
    \              of the Job Number as per the NetWare File Server Queue\n      \
    \            Management Services.\n10.2  jmJobIndex Mapped to PServer\n   The\
    \ job index (jmJobIndex) is assigned by the SNMP job monitoring\n   agent and\
    \ is independent of the Job Number assigned by the NetWare\n   File Server Queue\
    \ Management Services.  This will allow the SNMP\n   agent to track jobs received\
    \ from multiple sources.\n10.3  Other MIB Objects Mapped to PJL\n   MIB Object\

    \   ------\n   1. The job priority is determined by the priority assigned to the\n\
    \      queue that contains the job.  Each queue can be assigned a unique\n   \
    \   priority and the priority of the job is inherited from the queue.\n11.0  NETWARE\
    \ NPRINTER or RPRINTER\n   The NetWare NPrinter/RPrinter protocol was designed\
    \ to transfer print\n   data from a Novell File Server to a printer attached directly\
    \ to a\n   local port (e.g. parallel or serial) on a PC.  NPrinter/RPrinter is\n\
    \   an extremely lightweight printing protocol.  Consequently, no\n   information\
    \ required by the Job Monitoring MIB is provided and a\n   meaningful jmJobSubmissionID\
    \ cannot be generated.\n   It is recommended that an additional job submission\
    \ layer, such as\n   PJL or another vendor private protocol,  be included on top\
    \ of\n   NPrinter/RPrinter to provide the required information.  The mapping\n\
    \   should then be performed according to the recommendations of the\n   higher\
    \ layer submission protocol.\n12.0  SERVER MESSAGE BLOCK (SMB) PROTOCOL\n   The\
    \ Server Message Block protocol is used with several PC Network\n   operating\
    \ systems, such as Microsoft Windows for Workgroups, IBM LAN\n   Server, and Artisoft\
    \ Lantastic.  SMB systems supporting the Job\n   Monitoring MIB will conform to\
    \ either configuration 1 or 3.\n12.1  jmJobSubmissionID Mapped to SMB\n   octet\
    \ 1:   'C'\n   octets 2-40:  Contains a decimal (ASCII coded) representation of\
    \ the\n                 16 bit SMB Tree Id field, which uniquely identifies the\n\
    \                 connection that submitted the job to the printer.  The\n   \
    \              most significant digit of the numeric string shall be\n       \
    \          placed in octet position 2.  All unused portions of\n             \
    \    this field shall be filled with spaces.  The SMB Tree\n                 Id\
    \ has a maximum value of 65,535.\n   octets 41-48:  Contains a decimal (ASCII\
    \ coded) representation of the\n                  File Handle returned from the\
    \ printer agent to the\n                  client in response to a Create Print\
    \ File command.\n                  Leading zeros shall be inserted to fill the\
    \ entire 8\n                  octet field.\n12.2  jmJobIndex Mapped to SMB\n \
    \  It is strongly recommended that the File Handle returned from the\n   printer\
    \ agent be identical to jmJobIndex.  If these items are\n   identical, there is\
    \ no need for the client application to perform a\n   search on jmJobSubmissionID.\
    \  To be compatible with the 16 bit field\n   allocated to this value by SMB,\
    \ the maximum jmJobIndex is 65,535.\n12.3  Other MIB objects Mapped to SMB\n \
    \  MIB Object      | SMB Parameter\n   ----------------+------------------------------------------------\n\
    \   jmJobOwner      | SMB User Id field (note 1)\n   Notes:\n   ------\n   1.\
    \ A decimal (ASCII coded) representation of the SMB User Id numeric\n      shall\
    \ be presented as jmJobOwner.\n13.0  TRANSPORT INDEPENDENT PRINTER/SYSTEM INTERFACE\
    \ (TIP/SI)\n   The TIP/SI protocol, although currently specified as a part of\
    \ the\n   IEEE 1284 parallel port standards [TIP/SI], was originally developed\n\
    \   as a network protocol.  TIP/SI thus has the potential of being\n   integrated\
    \ into any network or non-network configuration.\n13.1  jmJobSubmissionID Mapped\
    \ to TIP/SI\n   octet 1:   'D'\n   octets 2-40:  Contains the Job Name from the\
    \ Job Control-Start Job\n                 (JC-SJ) command.  If the Job Name portion\
    \ is less than\n                 40 octets, the left-most character in the string\
    \ shall\n                 appear in octet position 2.  Any unused portion of this\n\
    \                 field shall be filled with spaces.  Otherwise, only the\n  \
    \               last 39 bytes shall be included.\n   octets 41-48:  Contains a\
    \ decimal (ASCII coded) representation of the\n                  jmJobIndex assigned\
    \ by the agent.  Leading zeros shall\n                  be inserted to fill the\
    \ entire 8 octet field.\n13.2  jmJobIndex Mapped to TIP/SI\n   jmJobIndex is returned\
    \ to the client as the Printer Assigned Job Id\n   in a Job Control-Start Job\
    \ (JC-SJ) response packet.  To be compatible\n   with the 16 bit field allocated\
    \ to this value by TIP/SI, the maximum\n   jmJobIndex is 65,535.\n13.3  Other\

    \ Considerations\n   This document provides mapping recommendations of job submission\n\
    \   protocols for use with the Job Monitoring MIB. The mapping procedures\n  \
    \ defined do not enhance or compromise any security provisions\n   available within\
    \ the job submission protocols contained within this\n   document.\n   The security\
    \ considerations specified for the Job Monitoring MIB\n   [JobMIB] are also unaffected\
    \ by any of the recommendations in this\n   document.\n   The security provisions\
    \ available in the job submission protocols are\n   documented in the appropriate\
    \ specifications that define the\n   protocols.  The degree of security available\
    \ varies from very good,\n   for protocols such as the Internet Printing Protocol\
    \ [IPP], to non-\n   existent, for example the Line Printer Daemon Protocol [LPD].\n\
    \   Since the defined mapping operation occurs as a secondary operation\n   after\
    \ the user has been authenticated and there is no storage of any\n   authorization\
    \ credentials other than the user name, no security\n   breaches are anticipated.\
    \  Also, the Job MIB does not provide any\n   back-door mechanism for access to\
    \ any other security parameters.\n   However, implementers must always consider\
    \ the impact of the defined\n   mapping procedures upon the security model desired\
    \ from the protocol.\n15.0  REFERENCES\n   [DPA]        ISO/IEC 10175-1:1996(E),\
