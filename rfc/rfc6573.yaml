- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   RFC 5988 standardized a means of indicating the relationships\
    \ between\n   resources on the Web. This specification defines a pair of reciprocal\n\
    \   link relation types that may be used to express the relationship\n   between\
    \ a collection and its members.\n   These link relation types can be applied to\
    \ a wide range of use cases\n   across multiple media types.  For example, the\
    \ 'collection' and\n   'item' link relation types are used in these media types:\n\
    \   1.  OpenSearch 1.1: see Section 4.5.4.1 of [OpenSearch]\n   2.  Maze+XML:\
    \ see [Maze]\n   3.  Collection+JSON: see [CollectionJSON]\n"
- title: 2.  Link Relations
  contents:
  - "2.  Link Relations\n   The following link relations are defined.\n"
- title: 2.1.  'item'
  contents:
  - "2.1.  'item'\n   When included in a resource that represents a collection, the\
    \ 'item'\n   link relation identifies a target resource that represents a member\n\
    \   of that collection.\n   For example, if a resource represents a catalog of\
    \ products, that\n   same representation may include one or more links to resources\
    \ that\n   represent members of that catalog.\n   <html>\n   ...\n     <h1>Product\
    \ Group X Listing</h1>\n     ...\n     <a href=\"...\" rel=\"item\">View Product\
    \ X001</a>\n     <a href=\"...\" rel=\"item\">View Product X002</a>\n     ...\n\
    \   </html>\n   or, in the case of a Link Header field\n   Link: <...>; rel=\"\
    item\"; title=\"View Product X001\"\n   Link: <...>; rel=\"item\"; title=\"View\
    \ Product X002\"\n"
- title: 2.2.  'collection'
  contents:
  - "2.2.  'collection'\n   When included in a resource that represents a member of\
    \ a collection,\n   the 'collection' link relation identifies a target resource\
    \ that\n   represents a collection of which the context resource is a member.\n\
    \   For example, if a resource represents a single product in a catalog,\n   that\
    \ same representation may include a link to a resource that\n   represents a product\
    \ group to which this single product belongs:\n   <a href=\"...\" rel=\"collection\"\
    >Return to Product Group X</a>\n   or, in the case of a Link Header field\n  \
    \ Link: <...>; rel=\"collection\"; title=\"Return to Product Group X\"\n   Since\
    \ it is possible that a resource could be a member of multiple\n   collections,\
    \ multiple 'collection' link relations may appear within\n   the same representation:\n\
    \   <a href=\"...\" rel=\"collection\">View other widgets</a>\n   <a href=\"...\"\
    \ rel=\"collection\">View all discontinued items</a>\n   The target resource representation\
    \ need not be restricted to\n   representing a list.  It may simply be a document\
    \ that provides\n   details on the collection of which the context resource is\
    \ a member:\n   Link: <...>; rel=\"collection\";\n         title=\"Shakespeare's\
    \ Collected Works - A History\"\n   It should also be noted that the same link\
    \ might represent an 'item'\n   in one collection as well as a 'collection' itself.\
    \  In this case,\n   both link relation values can be applied to the same link:\n\
    \   Link: <...>; rel=\"collection item\";\n         title=\"A Review of Issac\
    \ Asimov's Collected Works - Vol. I\"\n"
