  title: Abstract
- contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   This document specifies the operation of RADIUS [4]-[8]
    over IPv6\n   [13] as well as the RADIUS attributes used to support IPv6 network\n
    \  access.\n   Note that a NAS sending a RADIUS Access-Request may not know a-priori\n
    \  whether the host will be using IPv4, IPv6, or both.  For example,\n   within
    PPP, IPv6CP [11] occurs after LCP, so that address assignment\n   will not occur
    until after RADIUS authentication and authorization\n   has completed.\n   Therefore
    it is presumed that the IPv6 attributes described in this\n   document MAY be
    sent along with IPv4-related attributes within the\n   same RADIUS message and
    that the NAS will decide which attributes to\n   use.  The NAS SHOULD only allocate
    addresses and prefixes that the\n   client can actually use, however.  For example,
    there is no need for\n   the NAS to reserve use of an IPv4 address for a host
    that only\n   supports IPv6; similarly, a host only using IPv4 or 6to4 [12] does\n
    \  not require allocation of an IPv6 prefix.\n   The NAS can provide IPv6 access
    natively, or alternatively, via other\n   methods such as IPv6 within IPv4 tunnels
    [15] or 6over4 [14].  The\n   choice of method for providing IPv6 access has no
    effect on RADIUS\n   usage per se, although if it is desired that an IPv6 within
    IPv4\n   tunnel be opened to a particular location, then tunnel attributes\n   should
    be utilized, as described in [6], [7].\n"

  - "5.  Security Considerations\n   This document describes the use of RADIUS for
    the purposes of\n   authentication, authorization and accounting in IPv6-enabled\n
    \  networks.  In such networks, the RADIUS protocol may run either over\n   IPv4
    or over IPv6.  Known security vulnerabilities of the RADIUS\n   protocol are described
    in [3], [4] and [8].\n   Since IPSEC [9] is mandatory to implement for IPv6, it
    is expected\n   that running RADIUS implementations supporting IPv6 will typically\n
    \  run over IPSEC.  Where RADIUS is run over IPSEC and where\n   certificates
    are used for authentication, it may be desirable to\n   avoid management of RADIUS
    shared secrets, so as to leverage the\n   improved scalability of public key infrastructure.\n
    \  Within RADIUS, a shared secret is used for hiding of attributes such\n   as
    User-Password [4] and Tunnel-Password [7].  In addition, the\n   shared secret
    is used in computation of the Response Authenticator\n   [4], as well as the Message-Authenticator
    attribute [8].  Therefore,\n   in RADIUS a shared secret is used to provide confidentiality
    as well\n   as integrity protection and authentication.  As a result, only use
    of\n   IPSEC ESP with a non-null transform can provide security services\n   sufficient
    to substitute for RADIUS application-layer security.\n   Therefore, where IPSEC
    AH or ESP null is used, it will typically\n   still be necessary to configure
    a RADIUS shared secret.\n   However, where RADIUS is run over IPSEC ESP with a
    non-null\n   transform, the secret shared between the NAS and the RADIUS server\n
    \  MAY NOT be configured.  In this case, a shared secret of zero length\n   MUST
    be assumed.\n"
