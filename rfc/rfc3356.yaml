    \   collaboration on standards development between the ITU-T and the\n   Internet\
    \ Society (ISOC) / Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF).\n   In the IETF, work\
    \ is done in Working Groups (WG), mostly through\n   open, public mailing lists\
    \ rather than face-to-face meetings.  WGs\n   are organized into Areas, each Area\
    \ being managed by two co-Area\n   Directors.  Collectively, the Area Directors\
    \ comprise the Internet\n   Engineering Steering Group (IESG).\n   In the ITU-T,\
    \ work is defined by study Questions which are worked on\n   mostly through meetings\
    \ led by Rapporteurs.  Questions are generally\n   grouped within Working Parties\
    \ (WPs) led by a WP Chairman.  Working\n   Parties report to a parent Study Group\
    \ led by a SG Chairman.\n"

  - "2. Introduction\n   The telecommunication industry is faced with an explosion\
    \ in growth\n   of the Internet and other IP (Internet Protocol) based networks.\n\
    \   Operators, manufacturers and software/application providers alike are\n  \
    \ reconsidering their business directions and Standards Development\n   Organizations\
    \ and Forums and Consortia are facing an immense\n   challenge to address this\
    \ situation.\n   These challenges were considered by TSAG in September 1998 and\
    \ IETF\n   shortly thereafter, when it was initially recognized that the ITU-T\n\
    \   and ISOC/IETF were already collaborating in a number of areas, and\n   that\
    \ this collaboration must be strengthened within the context of\n   changes in\
    \ work emphasis and direction within the ITU-T on studies\n   related to IP based\
    \ networks.\n   For example, many Study Groups already address aspects of IP based\n\
    \   networks.  There are many topics of interest to ITU-T Study Groups in\n  \
    \ the IP area that should be investigated (e.g., signaling, routing,\n   security,\
    \ numbering & addressing, integrated management, performance,\n   IP - telecom\
    \ interworking, access).  Since many of these topics are\n   also being investigated\
    \ by the IETF, there is a requirement for close\n   collaboration.\n   The current\
    \ level of cooperation between the ITU-T and the IETF\n   should be built upon\
    \ to ensure that the competence and experience of\n   each organization is brought\
    \ to bear in the most effective manner and\n   in collaboration with the other.\
    \  This document provides guidelines\n   for collaboration between the ITU-T and\
    \ the IETF.\n"

  contents:
  - "3.1 How to Interact on ITU-T or IETF Work Items\n   Study Groups that have identified\
    \ work topics that are IP-related\n   should evaluate the relationship with topics\
    \ defined in the IETF.\n   Current IETF Working Groups and their charters (IETF\
    \ definition of\n   the scope of work) are listed in the IETF archives (see section\
    \ 3.5).\n   A Study Group may decide that development of a Recommendation on a\n\
    \   particular topic may benefit from collaboration with the IETF.  The\n   Study\
    \ Group should identify this collaboration in its work plan\n   (specifically\
    \ in that of each Question involved), describing the goal\n   of the collaboration\
    \ and its expected outcome.\n   An IETF Working Group should also evaluate and\
    \ identify areas of\n   relationship with the ITU-T and document the collaboration\
    \ with the\n   ITU-T Study Group in its charter.  The following sections outline\
    \ a\n   process that can be used to enable each group to learn about the\n   other's\
    \ new work items.\n"

    \ is on individual Study Groups to review the\n   current IETF Working Groups\
    \ to determine if there are any topics of\n   mutual interest.  Should a Study\
    \ Group believe that there is an\n   opportunity for collaboration on a topic\

    \ and the Area\n   Director(s) responsible.\n"
- title: 3.1.2 How the ITU-T learns about proposed new IETF work items
  contents:
  - "3.1.2 How the ITU-T learns about proposed new IETF work items\n   The IETF maintains\
    \ a mailing list for the distribution of proposed\n   new work items among standards\
    \ development organizations.  The IETF\n   forwards draft charters for all new\
    \ and revised Working Groups and\n   Birds Of a Feather session announcements\
    \ to the IETF NewWork mailing\n   list.  An ITU-T mail exploder is subscribed\
    \ to this list.  It is\n   recommended that each Study Group subscribe to this\
    \ ITU-T exploder,\n   which is maintained by the TSB.  Members of the SG-specific\
    \ listname\n   may include the SG Chairman, SG Vice Chairmen, Working Party\n\
    \   Chairmen, concerned Rapporteurs, other experts designated by the SG\n   and\
    \ the SG Counselor.  This will enable the SGs to monitor the new\n   work items\
    \ for possible overlap or interest to their Study Group.  It\n   is expected that\
    \ this mailing list will see a few messages per month.\n   Each SG Chairman, or\
    \ designated representative, may provide comments\n   on these charters by responding\
    \ to the IESG mailing list at\n   iesg@ietf.org clearly indicating their ITU-T\
    \ position and the nature\n   of their concern.  Plain-text email is preferred\
    \ on the IESG mailing\n   list.\n   It should be noted that the IETF turnaround\
    \ time for new Working\n   Group charters is two weeks.  As a result, the mailing\
    \ list should be\n   consistently monitored.\n"

- title: 3.2 Representation
  contents:
  - "3.2 Representation\n   ISOC, including its standards body IETF, is a Sector Member\
    \ of the\n   ITU-T.  As a result, ISOC delegates are therefore afforded the same\n\
    \   rights as other ITU-T Sector Members (see 3.2.1).  Conversely, ITU-T\n   delegates\
    \ may participate in the work of the IETF as representatives\n   of the ITU-T\
    \ (see 3.2.2).  To promote collaboration it is useful to\n   facilitate communication\
    \ between the organizations as further\n   described below.\n"

- title: 3.2.3 Communication Contacts
  contents:
  - "3.2.3 Communication Contacts\n   To foster ongoing communication between the\
    \ ITU-T and IETF, it is\n   important to identify and establish contact points\
    \ within each\n   organization.  Contact points may include:\n   1) ITU-T Study\
    \ Group Chairman and IETF Area Director\n      An IETF Area Director is the individual\
    \ responsible for overseeing\n      a major focus of activity with a scope similar\
    \ to that of an ITU-T\n      Study Group Chairman.  These positions are both relatively\
    \ long-\n      term (of several years) and offer the stability of contact points\n\
    \      between the two organizations for a given topic.\n   2) ITU-T Rapporteur\
    \ and IETF Working Group Chair\n      An IETF Working Group Chair is an individual\
    \ who is assigned to\n      lead the work on a specific task within one particular\
    \ Area with a\n      scope similar to that of an ITU-T Rapporteur.  These positions\
    \ are\n      working positions (of a year or more) that typically end when the\n\
    \      work on a specific topic ends.  Collaboration here is very\n      beneficial\
    \ to ensure the actual work gets done.\n   3) Other Contact Points\n      It may\
    \ be beneficial to establish additional contact points for\n      specific topics\
    \ of mutual interest.  These contact points should\n      be established early\
    \ in the work effort, and in some cases the\n      contact point identified by\
    \ each organization may be the same\n      individual.\n   Note that the current\
    \ IETF Area Directors and Working Group Chairs\n   can be found in the IETF Working\
    \ Group charters.  The current ITU-T\n   Study Group Chairmen and Rapporteurs\
    \ are listed on the ITU-T web\n   page.\n"
- title: 3.2.4 Communication
  contents:
  - "3.2.4 Communication\n   Informal communication between contact points and experts\
    \ of both\n   organizations is encouraged.  However, note that formal communication\n\
    \   from an ITU-T Study Group, Working Party or Rapporteur to an\n   associated\
    \ IETF contact point must be explicitly approved and\n   identified as coming\
    \ from the Study Group, Working Party or\n   Rapporteur Group, respectively. \
    \ Formal communication from the ITU-T\n   to the IETF should be addressed to the\
    \ appropriate Working Group\n   Chairs and Area Directors with a copy to the email\
    \ address\n   \"statements@ietf.org.\"  These communications are placed by the\
    \ IETF\n   onto a liaison statements web page at\n   http://www.ietf.org/IESG/liaison.html.\
    \  An individual at the IETF is\n   assigned responsibility for dealing with each\
    \ communication that is\n   received.  The name and contact information of the\
    \ responsible person\n   is listed with the links to the communications on this\
    \ web page.\n   Conversely, formal communication from an IETF Working Group or\
    \ Area\n   Director must also be explicitly approved and identified before\n \
    \  forwarding to any ITU-T contact.  This approval is indicated in IETF\n   communication\
    \ by copying the appropriate Working Group Chairs and\n   Area Directors.  Formal\
    \ communication is intended to allow the\n   sharing of positions between the\
    \ IETF and the ITU-T outside of actual\n   documents (as described in 3.3).  This\
    \ would cover such things as\n   comments on documents and requests for input.\

    \ topics within Study Groups (more detail can\n   be found on the ITU website).\
    \  These mailing lists are typically used\n   for discussion of ITU-T contributions.\
    \  Note that individual\n   subscribers to this list must be affiliated with an\
    \ ITU-T member (at\n   this time, there is no blanket inclusion of all IETF participants\
    \ as\n   members, however, as a member, ISOC may designate representatives to\n\

    \ places, a few\n   additional references have been provided, and the details\
    \ of the\n   cooperation process have been modified slightly.\n   Sec 3.2.1 -\

    \ IAB Chair instead of the ISOC VP for Standards.\n   Sec 3.2.2 - Notice of ITU-T\
    \ delegates to IETF Working Group meetings\n      is now sent to the Working Group\
    \ chairs and appropriate Area\n      Directors instead of the ISOC VP for Standards.\n\
    \   Sec 3.2.4 - Official communications from the ITU-T to the IETF now\n     \
    \ are sent to the appropriate Working Group Chairs and Area\n      Directors with\
    \ a copy to the email address \"statements@ietf.org\"\n      instead of to the\
    \ ISOC VP for Standards.  A description of the new\n      IETF liaison statements\
    \ web page was added.  Official approval of\n      messages from the IETF to the\
    \ ITU-T is now indicated by having the\n      appropriate Working Group Chairs\
    \ and Area Directors copied on the\n      message.\n   Sec 3.3 - A description\
    \ of the new ITU-T common FTP area was added.\n   Sec 3.3.1 - The appropriate\
