  contents:
  - "2.  Kerberos V GSS Mechanism PRF\n   The GSS-API PRF [RFC4401] function for the\
    \ Kerberos V mechanism\n   [RFC4121] shall be the output of a PRF+ function based\
    \ on the\n   encryption type's PRF function keyed with the negotiated session\
    \ key\n   of the security context corresponding to the 'prf_key' input\n   parameter\
    \ of GSS_Pseudo_random().\n   This PRF+ MUST be keyed with the key indicated by\
    \ the 'prf_key' input\n   parameter as follows:\n   o  GSS_C_PRF_KEY_FULL -- use\
    \ the sub-session key asserted by the\n      acceptor, if any, or the sub-session\
    \ asserted by the initiator, if\n      any, or the Ticket's session key\n   o\
    \  GSS_C_PRF_KEY_PARTIAL -- use the sub-session key asserted by the\n      initiator,\
    \ if any, or the Ticket's session key\n   The PRF+ function is a simple counter-based\
    \ extension of the Kerberos\n   V pseudo-random function [RFC3961] for the encryption\
    \ type of the\n   security context's keys:\n         PRF+(K, L, S) = truncate(L,\
    \ T1 || T2 || .. || Tn)\n         Tn = pseudo-random(K, n || S)\n   where '||'\
    \ is the concatenation operator, 'n' is encoded as a network\n   byte order 32-bit\
    \ unsigned binary number, truncate(L, S) truncates\n   the input octet string\
    \ S to length L, and pseudo-random() is the\n   Kerberos V pseudo-random function\
    \ [RFC3961].\n   The maximum output size of the Kerberos V mechanism's GSS-API\
    \ PRF\n   then is, necessarily, 2^32 times the output size of the pseudo-\n  \
    \ random() function for the encryption type of the given key.\n   When the input\
    \ size is longer than 2^14 octets as per [RFC4401] and\n   exceeds an implementation's\
    \ resources, then the mechanism MUST return\n   GSS_S_FAILURE and GSS_KRB5_S_KG_INPUT_TOO_LONG\
    \ as the minor status\n   code.\n"

  contents:
  - "3.  IANA Considerations\n   This document has no IANA considerations currently.\
    \  If and when a\n   relevant IANA registry of GSS-API symbols and constants is\
    \ created,\n   then the GSS_KRB5_S_KG_INPUT_TOO_LONG minor status code should\
    \ be\n   added to such a registry.\n"
- title: 4.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "4.  Security Considerations\n   Kerberos V encryption types' PRF functions use\
    \ a key derived from\n   contexts' session keys and should preserve the forward\
    \ security\n   properties of the mechanisms' key exchanges.\n   Legacy Kerberos\
    \ V encryption types may be weak, particularly the\n   single-DES encryption types.\n\
    \   See also [RFC4401] for generic security considerations of\n   GSS_Pseudo_random().\n\
    \   See also [RFC3961] for generic security considerations of the\n   Kerberos\
    \ V cryptographic framework.\n   Use of Ticket session keys, rather than sub-session\
    \ keys, when\n   initiators and acceptors fail to assert sub-session keys, is\n\
    \   dangerous as ticket reuse can lead to key reuse; therefore,\n   initiators\
    \ should assert sub-session keys always, and acceptors\n   should assert sub-session\
    \ keys at least when initiators fail to do\n   so.\n   The computational cost\
    \ of computing this PRF+ may vary depending on\n   the Kerberos V encryption types\
    \ being used, but generally the\n   computation of this PRF+ gets more expensive\
    \ as the input and output\n   octet string lengths grow (note that the use of\
    \ a counter in the PRF+\n   construction allows for parallelization).  This means\
    \ that if an\n   application can be tricked into providing very large input octet\n\
    \   strings and requesting very long output octet strings, then that may\n   constitute\
    \ a denial of service attack on the application; therefore,\n   applications SHOULD\
    \ place appropriate limits on the size of any input\n   octet strings received\
    \ from their peers without integrity protection.\n"
