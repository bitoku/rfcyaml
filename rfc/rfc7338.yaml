  contents:
  - "1.1.  Problem Statement\n   As defined in the pseudowire architecture [RFC3985],\
    \ a pseudowire\n   (PW) is a mechanism that emulates the essential attributes\
    \ of a\n   telecommunications service (such as a T1 leased line or Frame Relay)\n\
    \   over an IP or MPLS Packet Switched Network (PSN).  It provides a\n   single\
    \ service that is perceived by its user as an unshared link or\n   circuit of\
    \ the chosen service.  A pseudowire is used to transport\n   Layer 1 or Layer\
    \ 2 traffic (e.g., Ethernet, Time-Division\n   Multiplexing (TDM), ATM, and Frame\
    \ Relay) over a Layer 3 PSN.\n   Pseudowire Emulation Edge-to-Edge (PWE3) operates\
    \ \"edge to edge\" to\n   provide the required connectivity between the two endpoints\
    \ of the\n   PW.\n   The point-to-multipoint (P2MP) topology described in [VPMS-REQS]\
    \ and\n   required to provide P2MP Layer 2 VPN service can be achieved using\n\
    \   one or more P2MP PWs.  The use of PW encapsulation enables P2MP\n   services\
    \ to transport Layer 1 or Layer 2 data.  This could be\n   achieved using a set\
    \ of point-to-point PWs, with traffic replication\n   at the Root Provider Edge\
    \ (PE), but at the cost of bandwidth\n   efficiency, as duplicate traffic would\
    \ be carried multiple times on\n   shared links.\n   This document defines the\
    \ requirements for a point-to-multipoint PW\n   (P2MP PW).  A P2MP PW is a mechanism\
    \ that emulates the essential\n   attributes of a P2MP telecommunications service\
    \ such as a P2MP ATM\n   Virtual Circuit over a Packet Switched Network.\n   The\
    \ required functions of P2MP PWs include encapsulating service-\n   specific Protocol\
    \ Data Units (PDUs) arriving at an ingress Attachment\n   Circuit (AC), carrying\
    \ them across a tunnel to one or more egress\n   ACs, managing their timing and\
    \ order, and any other operations\n   required to emulate the behavior and characteristics\
    \ of the service\n   as faithfully as possible.\n"

    \ Model\n   This architecture applies to the case where a P2MP PSN tunnel extends\n\
    \   between edge nodes of a single PSN domain to transport a\n   unidirectional\
    \ P2MP PW with endpoints at these edge nodes.  In this\n   model, a single copy\
    \ of each PW packet is sent over the PW on the\n   P2MP PSN tunnel and is received\
    \ by all Leaf PEs due to the P2MP\n   nature of the PSN tunnel.  The P2MP PW SHOULD\
    \ be traffic optimized,\n   i.e., only one copy of a P2MP PW packet or PSN tunnel\
    \ (underlying\n   layer) packet is sent on any single link along the P2MP path.\
    \  P\n   routers participate in P2MP PSN tunnel operation but not in the\n   signaling\
    \ of P2MP PWs.\n   The Reference Model outlines the basic pieces of a P2MP PW.\
    \  However,\n   several levels of replication need to be considered when designing\
    \ a\n   P2MP PW solution:\n   -  Ingress PE replication to CEs: traffic is replicated\
    \ to a set of\n      local receiver CEs\n   -  P router replication in the core:\
    \ traffic is replicated by means\n      of a P2MP PSN tunnel (P2MP LSP)\n   -\
    \  Egress PE replication to CEs: traffic is replicated to local\n      receiver\
    \ CEs\n   Theoretically, it is also possible to consider Ingress PE replication\n\
    \   in the core; that is, all traffic is replicated to a set of P2P PSN\n   transport\
    \ tunnels at ingress, not using P router replication at all.\n   However, this\
    \ approach may lead to duplicate copies of each PW packet\n   being sent over\
    \ the same physical link, specifically in the case\n   where multiple PSN tunnels\
    \ transit that physical link.  Hence, this\n   approach is not preferred.\n  \
    \ Specific operations that MUST be performed at the PE on the native\n   data\
    \ units are not described here since the required pre-processing\n   (Forwarder\
    \ (FWRD) and Native Service Processing (NSP)) defined in\n   Section 4.2 of [RFC3985]\
    \ is also applicable to P2MP PW.\n   P2MP PWs are generally unidirectional, but\
    \ a Root PE may need to\n   receive unidirectional P2P return traffic from any\
    \ Leaf PE.  For that\n   purpose, the P2MP PW solution MAY support an optional\
    \ return path\n   from each Leaf PE to the Root PE.\n"
- title: 3.2.  P2MP PW and Underlying Layer
  contents:
  - "3.2.  P2MP PW and Underlying Layer\n   The definition of MPLS multicast encapsulation\
    \ [RFC5332] specifies\n   the procedure to carry MPLS packets that are to be replicated\
    \ and a\n   copy of the packet sent to each of the specified next hops.  This\n\
    \   notion is also applicable to a P2MP PW packet carried by a P2MP PSN\n   tunnel.\n\
    \   To be more precise, a P2MP PSN tunnel corresponds to a \"point-to-\n   multipoint\
    \ data link or tunnel\" described in Section 3 of [RFC5332].\n   Similarly, P2MP\
    \ PW labels correspond to \"the top labels (before\n   applying the data link\
    \ or tunnel encapsulation) of all MPLS packets\n   that are transmitted on a particular\
    \ point-to-multipoint data link or\n   tunnel\".\n   In the P2MP PW architecture\
    \ using the SS-PW network model, the PW-PDU\n   [RFC3985] is replicated by the\
    \ underlying P2MP PSN tunnel layer.\n   Note that the PW label is unchanged, and\
    \ hidden in switching, by the\n   transit P routers.\n   In a solution, a P2MP\
    \ PW MUST be supported over a single P2MP PSN\n   tunnel as the underlying layer\
    \ of traffic distribution.  Figure 2\n   gives an example of P2MP PW topology\
    \ relying on a single P2MP LSP.\n   The PW tree is composed of one Root PE (i1)\
    \ and several Leaf PEs (e1,\n   e2, e3, e4).\n   The mechanisms for establishing\
    \ the PSN tunnel are outside the scope\n   of this document, as long as they enable\
    \ the essential attributes of\n   the service to be emulated.\n              \

    \          Figure 2: Example of P2MP Underlying Layer for P2MP PW\n   A single\
    \ P2MP PSN tunnel MUST be able to serve the traffic from more\n   than one P2MP\
    \ PW in an aggregated way, i.e., multiplexing.\n   A P2MP PW solution MAY support\
    \ different P2MP PSN tunneling\n   technology (e.g., MPLS over GRE [RFC4023] or\
    \ P2MP MPLS LSP) or\n   different setup protocols (e.g., multipoint extensions\
    \ for LDP (mLDP)\n   [RFC6388] and P2MP RSVP-TE [RFC4875]).\n   The P2MP LSP associated\
    \ to the P2MP PW can be selected either by user\n   configuration or by dynamically\
    \ using a multiplexing/demultiplexing\n   mechanism.\n   The P2MP PW multiplexing\
    \ SHOULD be used based on the overlap rate\n   between P2MP LSP and P2MP PW. \
    \ As an example, an existing P2MP LSP\n   may attach more leaves than the ones\
    \ defined as Leaf PEs for a given\n   P2MP PW.  It may be attractive to reuse\
    \ it to minimize new\n   configuration, but using this P2MP LSP would cause non-Leaf\
    \ PEs\n   (i.e., not part of the P2MP PW) to receive unwanted traffic.\n   Note:\
    \ no special configuration is needed for non-Leaf PEs to drop\n   that unwanted\
    \ traffic because they do not have forwarding information\n   entries unless they\
    \ process the setup operation for corresponding\n   P2MP PWs (e.g., signaling).\n\
    \   The operator SHOULD determine whether it is acceptable to partially\n   multiplex\
    \ the P2MP PW onto a P2MP LSP, and a minimum congruency rate\n   may be defined\
    \ to enable the Root PE to make this determination.  The\n   congruency rate SHOULD\
    \ take into account several items, including:\n   -  the amount of overlap between\
    \ the Leaf PEs of the P2MP PW and the\n      existing egress PE routers of the\
    \ P2MP LSP.  If there is a\n      complete overlap, the congruency is perfect\
    \ and the rate is 100%.\n   -  the impact on other traffic (e.g., from other VPNs)\
    \ supported over\n      the P2MP LSP.\n   With this procedure, a P2MP PW is nested\
    \ within a P2MP LSP.  This\n   allows multiplexing several PWs over a common P2MP\
    \ LSP.  Prior to the\n   P2MP PW signaling phase, the Root PE determines which\
    \ P2MP LSP will\n   be used for this P2MP PW.  The PSN tunnel can be an existing\
    \ PSN\n   tunnel or the Root PE can create a new P2MP PSN tunnel.  Note that\n\
    \   the ingress PE may modify or re-create an existing P2MP PSN tunnel in\n  \
    \ order to add one or more leaf PEs to enable it to transport the P2MP\n   PW.\n"

    \ out-of-band or in-band Operations, Administration, and\n   Maintenance (OAM)\
    \ messages for monitoring.\n   It MUST be possible for the operator to choose\
    \ the out-of-band or in-\n   band monitoring tools or both to monitor the Leaf\
    \ PE status.  For\n   management purposes, the solution SHOULD allow the Root\
    \ PE to be\n   informed of Leaf PEs' failure.\n   Based on these failure notifications,\
    \ solutions MUST allow the Root\n   PE to update the remaining leaves of the PW\
    \ tree.\n   -  A solution MUST support an in-band status notification mechanism\n\
    \      to detect failures: unidirectional point-to-multipoint traffic\n      failure.\
    \  This MUST be realized by enhancing existing unicast PW\n      methods, such\
    \ as Virtual Circuit Connectivity Verification (VCCV)\n      for seamless and\
    \ familiar operation as defined in [RFC5085].\n   -  In case of failure, it MUST\
    \ correctly report which Leaf PEs are\n      affected.  This MUST be realized\
    \ by enhancing existing PW methods,\n      such as LDP Status Notification.  The\
    \ notification message SHOULD\n      include the type of fault (P2MP PW, AC, or\
    \ PSN tunnel).\n   -  A Leaf PE MAY be notified of the status of the Root PE's\
    \ AC.\n   -  A solution MUST support OAM message mapping [RFC6310] at the Root\n\
    \      PE and Leaf PE if a failure is detected on the source CE.\n"

- title: 4.  Backward Compatibility
  contents:
  - "4.  Backward Compatibility\n   Solutions MUST be backward compatible with current\
    \ PW standards.\n   Solutions SHOULD utilize existing capability advertisement\
    \ and\n   negotiation procedures for the PEs implementing P2MP PW endpoints.\n\
    \   The implementation of OAM mechanisms also implies the advertisement\n   of\
    \ PE capabilities to support specific OAM features.  The solution\n   MAY allow\
    \ advertising P2MP PW OAM capabilities.  A solution MUST NOT\n   allow a P2MP\
    \ PW to be established to PEs that do not support P2MP PW\n   functionality. \
    \ It MUST have a mechanism to report an error for\n   incompatible PEs.\n   In\
    \ some cases, upstream traffic is needed from downstream CEs to\n   upstream CEs.\
    \  The P2MP PW solution SHOULD allow a return path (i.e.,\n   from the Leaf PE\
    \ to the Root PE) that provides upstream connectivity.\n   In particular, the\
    \ same ACs MAY be shared between the downstream and\n   upstream directions. \
    \ For downstream, a CE receives traffic\n   originated by the Root PE over its\
    \ AC.  For upstream, the CE MAY also\n   send traffic destined to the same Root\
    \ PE over the same AC.\n"
- title: 5.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "5.  Security Considerations\n   The security requirements common to PW are raised\
    \ in Section 11 of\n   [RFC3916].  P2MP PW is a variant of the initial P2P PW\
    \ definition,\n   and those requirements (and the security considerations from\n\
    \   [RFC3985]) also apply.  The security considerations from [RFC5920]\n   and\
    \ [RFC6941] also apply to the IP/MPLS and MPLS-TP deployment\n   scenarios, respectively.\n\
    \   Some issues specifically due to P2MP topology need to be addressed in\n  \
    \ the definition of the solution:\n   -  The solution SHOULD provide means to\
    \ protect the traffic delivered\n      to receivers (Integrity, Confidentiality,\
    \ Endpoint\n      Authentication).\n   -  The solution SHOULD support means to\
    \ protect the P2MP PW as a\n      whole against attacks that would lead to any\
    \ kind of denial of\n      service.\n   Specifically, safeguard mechanisms should\
    \ be considered to avoid any\n   negative impact on the whole PW tree when any\
    \ one receiver or any\n   group of receivers is attacked.  Safeguard mechanisms\
    \ for both the\n   data plane and the control plane need to be considered.\n"
