  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   The International Telecommunication Union (ITU-T) Recommendation\n\
    \   G.729.1 [ITU-G.729.1] is a scalable and wideband extension of the\n   Recommendation\
    \ G.729 [ITU-G.729] audio codec.  [RFC4749] specifies\n   the payload format for\
    \ packetization of G.729.1-encoded audio signals\n   into the Real-time Transport\
    \ Protocol (RTP) [RFC3550].\n   Annex C of G.729.1 [ITU-G.729.1-C] adds Discontinuous\
    \ Transmission\n   (DTX) support to G.729.1.  This document updates the RTP payload\n\
    \   format to allow usage of this Annex.\n   Only changes or additions to [RFC4749]\
    \ will be described in the\n   following sections.\n   The key words \"MUST\"\
    , \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD\
    \ NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n   document are to\
    \ be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].\n"
- title: 2.  Background
  contents:
  - "2.  Background\n   G.729.1 supports Discontinuous Transmission (DTX), a.k.a.\
    \ \"silence\n   suppression\".  It means that the coder includes a Voice Activity\n\
    \   Detection (VAD) algorithm to determine if an audio frame contains\n   silence\
    \ or actual audio.  During silence periods, the coder may\n   significantly decrease\
    \ the transmitted bit rate by sending a small\n   frame called a Silence Insertion\
    \ Descriptor (SID) and then stop\n   transmission.  The receiver's decoder will\
    \ generate comfort noise\n   (CNG) according to the parameters contained in the\
    \ SID.  This DTX/CNG\n   scheme is specified in [ITU-G.729.1-C].\n   The G.729.1\
    \ SID has an embedded structure.  The core SID is the same\n   as the legacy G.729\
    \ SID [ITU-G.729-B].  The first enhancement layer\n   adds some parameters for\
    \ narrowband comfort noise, while a second\n   enhancement layer adds wideband\
    \ information.  The G.729.1 SID can be\n   2, 3, or 6 octets long.\n"
- title: 3.  RTP Header Usage
  contents:
  - "3.  RTP Header Usage\n   The fields of the RTP header must be used as described\
    \ in [RFC4749],\n   except for the Marker (M) bit.\n   If DTX is used, the first\
    \ packet of a talkspurt -- that is, the first\n   packet after a silence period\
    \ during which packets have not been\n   transmitted contiguously -- MUST be distinguished\
    \ by setting the M\n   bit in the RTP data header to 1.  The M bit in all other\
    \ packets MUST\n   be set to 0.  The beginning of a talkspurt MAY be used to adjust\
    \ the\n   playout delay to reflect changing network delays.\n   If DTX is not\
    \ used, the M bit MUST be set to 0 in all packets.\n"
- title: 4.  Payload Format
  contents:
  - "4.  Payload Format\n   The payload format is the same as in [RFC4749], with the\
    \ option to\n   add a SID at the end.\n   So the complete payload consists of\
    \ a payload header of 1 octet (MBS\n   (maximum bit rate supported) and FT (frame\
    \ type) fields), followed by\n   zero or more consecutive audio frames at the\
    \ same bit rate, followed\n   by zero or one SID.\n      Note that this is consistent\
    \ with the payload format of G.729\n      described in section 4.5.6 of [RFC3551].\n\
    \   To be able to transport a SID alone -- that is, without actual audio\n   frames\
    \ -- we assign the FT value 14 to the SID.  When using FT=14,\n   only a single\
    \ SID frame SHALL be included in the payload.  The actual\n   SID size (2, 3,\
    \ or 6 octets) is inferred from the payload size: it is\n   the size of what is\
    \ left after the payload header.\n   When a SID is appended to actual audio frames,\
    \ the FT value remains\n   the one describing the encoding rate of the audio frames.\
    \  Since the\n   SID is much smaller than any other frame, it can be easily detected\n\
    \   at the receiver side, and it will not hinder the calculation of the\n   number\
    \ of frames.  The actual SID size is inferred from the payload\n   size: it is\
    \ the size of what is left after the audio frames.\n   Section 5.4 of [RFC4749]\
    \ mandates to ignore the remaining bytes after\n   complete frames.  This document\
    \ overrides that statement: the\n   receiver of the payload must consider these\
    \ remaining bytes as a SID\n   frame.  If the size of this remainder is not a\
    \ valid SID frame size\n   (2, 3, or 6 octets), the receiver MUST ignore these\
    \ bytes.\n   The full FT table is given for convenience:\n               +-------+---------------+-------------------+\n\
    \               |   FT  | encoding rate |     frame size    |\n              \

  contents:
  - "5.  Payload Format Parameters\n   Parameters defined in [RFC4749] are not modified.\
    \  We add a new\n   optional parameter to configure DTX.\n"
- title: 5.1.  Media Type Registration Update
  contents:
  - "5.1.  Media Type Registration Update\n   We add a new optional parameter to the\
    \ audio/G7291 media subtype:\n   dtx: indicates that Discontinuous Transmission\
    \ (DTX) is used or\n      preferred.  Permissible values are 0 and 1. 0 means\
    \ no DTX. 1\n      means DTX support, as described in Annex C of ITU-T Recommendation\n\
    \      G.729.1. 0 is implied if this parameter is omitted.\n   When DTX is turned\
    \ off, the RTP payload MUST NOT contain a SID, and\n   the FT value 14 MUST NOT\
    \ be used.\n"
- title: 5.2.  Mapping to SDP Parameters
  contents:
  - "5.2.  Mapping to SDP Parameters\n   The information carried in the media type\
    \ specification has a\n   specific mapping to fields in the Session Description\
    \ Protocol (SDP)\n   [RFC4566], which is commonly used to describe RTP sessions.\n\
    \   The mapping described in [RFC4749] remains unchanged.\n   The \"dtx\" parameter\
    \ goes in the SDP \"a=fmtp\" attribute.\n   Some example partial SDP session descriptions\
    \ utilizing G.729.1\n   encodings follow.\n   Example 1: default parameters (DTX\
    \ off)\n      m=audio 57586 RTP/AVP 96\n      a=rtpmap:96 G7291/16000\n   Example\

- title: 5.2.1.  DTX Offer-Answer Model Considerations
  contents:
  - "5.2.1.  DTX Offer-Answer Model Considerations\n   The offer-answer model considerations\
    \ of [RFC4749] fully apply.  In\n   this section, we only define the management\
    \ of the \"dtx\" parameter.\n   The \"dtx\" parameter concerns both sending and\
    \ receiving, so both\n   sides of a bi-directional session MUST have the same\
    \ DTX setting.  If\n   one party indicates that it does not support DTX, DTX must\
    \ be\n   deactivated both ways.  In other words, DTX is actually activated if,\n\
    \   and only if, \"dtx=1\" in the offer and in the answer.\n   A special rule\
    \ applies for multicast: the \"dtx\" parameter becomes\n   declarative and MUST\
    \ NOT be negotiated.  This parameter is fixed, and\n   a participant MUST use\
    \ the configuration that is provided for the\n   session.\n   An RTP receiver\
    \ compliant with only RFC 4749 and not this\n   specification will ignore the\
    \ \"dtx\" parameter and will not include it\n   in its answer, so DTX will not\
    \ be activated in this case.  As a\n   remark, if that happened, this kind of\
    \ receiver would not be confused\n   by an RTP stream with DTX because RFC 4749\
    \ requires that the bytes\n   that are now used for SID frames be ignored.  But\
    \ during the silence\n   period, the receiver would then react using packet loss\
    \ concealment\n   instead of comfort noise generation, leading to bad audio quality.\n\
    \   This justifies the use of the \"dtx\" parameter, even if the payload\n   format\
    \ is backward-compatible at the binary level.\n"
- title: 5.2.2.  DTX Declarative SDP Considerations
  contents:
  - "5.2.2.  DTX Declarative SDP Considerations\n   The \"dtx\" parameter is declarative\
    \ and provides the parameter that\n   SHALL be used when receiving and/or sending\
    \ the configured stream.\n"
- title: 6.  Congestion Control
  contents:
  - "6.  Congestion Control\n   The congestion control considerations of [RFC4749]\
    \ apply.\n   The use of DTX can help congestion control by reducing the number\
    \ of\n   transmitted RTP packets and the average bandwidth of audio streams.\n"
- title: 7.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "7.  Security Considerations\n   The security considerations of [RFC4749] apply.\n\
    \   By observing the RTP flow with DTX, an attacker could see when and\n   for\
    \ how long people are speaking.  This is a general fact for DTX,\n   and G.729.1\
    \ DTX introduces no new specific issue.\n"
