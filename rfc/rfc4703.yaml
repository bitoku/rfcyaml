  - "1.  Introduction\n   \"The Client FQDN Option\" [8] includes a description of\
    \ the operation\n   of [4] clients and servers that use the DHCPv4 client FQDN\
    \ option.\n   \"The DHCPv6 Client FQDN Option\" [9] includes a description of\
    \ the\n   operation of [5] clients and servers that use the DHCPv6 client FQDN\n\
    \   option.  Through the use of the client FQDN option, DHCP clients and\n   servers\
    \ can negotiate the client's FQDN and the allocation of\n   responsibility for\
    \ updating the DHCP client's A and/or AAAA RRs.\n   This document identifies situations\
    \ in which conflicts in the use of\n   FQDNs may arise among DHCP clients and\
    \ servers, and it describes a\n   strategy for the use of the DHCID DNS resource\
    \ record [2] in\n   resolving those conflicts.\n   In any case, whether a site\
    \ permits all, some, or no DHCP servers and\n   clients to perform DNS updates\
    \ ([3], [10]) into the zones that it\n   controls is entirely a matter of local\
    \ administrative policy.  This\n   document does not require any specific administrative\
    \ policy, and\n   does not propose one.  The range of possible policies is very\
    \ broad,\n   from sites where only the DHCP servers have been given credentials\n\
    \   that the DNS servers will accept, to sites where each individual DHCP\n  \
    \ client has been configured with credentials that allow the client to\n   modify\
    \ its own FQDN.  Compliant implementations MAY support some or\n   all of these\
    \ possibilities.  Furthermore, this specification applies\n   only to DHCP client\
    \ and server processes; it does not apply to other\n   processes that initiate\
    \ DNS updates.\n"

- title: 3.  Issues with DNS Update in DHCP Environments
  contents:
  - "3.  Issues with DNS Update in DHCP Environments\n   There are two DNS update\
    \ situations that require special\n   consideration in DHCP environments: cases\
    \ where more than one DHCP\n   client has been configured with the same FQDN,\
    \ and cases where more\n   than one DHCP server has been given authority to perform\
    \ DNS updates\n   in a zone.  In these cases, it is possible for DNS records to\
    \ be\n   modified in inconsistent ways unless the updaters have a mechanism\n\
    \   that allows them to detect anomalous situations.  If DNS updaters can\n  \
    \ detect these situations, site administrators can configure the\n   updaters'\
    \ behavior so that the site's policies can be enforced.  This\n   specification\
    \ describes a mechanism designed to allow updaters to\n   detect these situations\
    \ and suggests that DHCP implementations use\n   this mechanism by default.\n"
- title: 3.1.  Client Misconfiguration
  contents:
  - "3.1.  Client Misconfiguration\n   Administrators may wish to maintain a one-to-one\
    \ relationship between\n   active DHCP clients and FQDNs, and to maintain consistency\
    \ between a\n   client's A, AAAA, and PTR RRs.  Clients that are not represented\
    \ in\n   the DNS, or clients that inadvertently share an FQDN with another\n \
    \  client may encounter inconsistent behavior or may not be able to\n   obtain\
    \ access to network resources.  Whether each DHCP client is\n   configured with\
    \ an FQDN by its administrator or whether the DHCP\n   server is configured to\
    \ distribute the clients' FQDN, the consistency\n   of the DNS data is entirely\
    \ dependent on the accuracy of the\n   configuration procedure.  Sites that deploy\
    \ [10] may configure\n   credentials for each client and its assigned FQDN in\
    \ a way that is\n   more error-resistant, as both the FQDN and credentials must\
    \ match.\n   Consider an example in which two DHCP clients in the \"example.com\"\
    \n   network are both configured with the hostname \"foo\".  The clients are\n\
    \   permitted to perform their own DNS updates.  The first client, client\n  \
    \ A, is configured via DHCP.  It adds an A RR to \"foo.example.com\", and\n  \
    \ its DHCP server adds a PTR RR corresponding to its assigned IP\n   address.\
    \  When the second client, client B, boots, it is also\n   configured via DHCP,\
    \ and it also begins to update \"foo.example.com\".\n   At this point, the \"\
    example.com\" administrators may wish to establish\n   some policy about DHCP\
    \ clients' FQDNs.  If the policy is that each\n   client that boots should replace\
    \ any existing A RR that matches its\n   FQDN, Client B can proceed, though Client\
    \ A may encounter problems.\n   In this example, Client B replaces the A RR associated\
    \ with\n   \"foo.example.com\".  Client A must have some way to recognize that\
    \ the\n   RR associated with \"foo.example.com\" now contains information for\n\
    \   Client B, so that it can avoid modifying the RR.  When Client A's\n   assigned\
    \ IP address expires, for example, it should not remove an RR\n   that reflects\
    \ Client B's DHCP-assigned IP address.\n   If the policy is that the first DHCP\
    \ client with a given FQDN should\n   be the only client associated with that\
    \ FQDN, Client B needs to be\n   able to determine if it is not the client associated\
    \ with\n   \"foo.example.com\".  It could be that Client A booted first, and that\n\
    \   Client B should choose another FQDN.  Or it could be that B has\n   booted\
    \ on a new subnet and received a new IP address assignment, in\n   which case\
    \ B should update the DNS with its new IP address.  It must\n   either retain\
    \ persistent state about the last IP address it was\n   assigned (in addition\
    \ to its current IP address) or it must have some\n   other way to detect that\
    \ it was the last updater of \"foo.example.com\"\n   in order to implement the\
    \ site's policy.\n"
- title: 3.2.  Multiple DHCP Servers
  contents:
  - "3.2.  Multiple DHCP Servers\n   It is possible to arrange for DHCP servers to\
    \ perform A and/or AAAA\n   RR updates on behalf of their clients.  If a single\
    \ DHCP server\n   manages all of the DHCP clients at a site, it can maintain a\
    \ database\n   of the FQDNs in use and can check that database before assigning\
    \ an\n   FQDN to a client.  Such a database is necessarily proprietary,\n   however,\
    \ and the approach does not work once more than one DHCP\n   server is deployed.\n\
    \   When multiple DHCP servers are deployed, the servers require a way to\n  \
    \ coordinate the identities of DHCP clients.  Consider an example in\n   which\
    \ DHCPv4 Client A boots, obtains an IP address from Server S1,\n   presenting\
    \ the hostname \"foo\" in a Client FQDN option [8] in its\n   DHCPREQUEST message.\
    \  Server S1 updates the FQDN \"foo.example.com\",\n   adding an A RR containing\
    \ the IP address assigned to A.  The client\n   then moves to another subnet,\
    \ served by Server S2.  When Client A\n   boots on the new subnet, Server S2 will\
    \ assign it a new IP address\n   and will attempt to add an A RR containing the\
    \ newly assigned IP\n   address to the FQDN \"foo.example.com\".  At this point,\
    \ without some\n   communication mechanism that S2 can use to ask S1 (and every\
    \ other\n   DHCP server that updates the zone) about the client, S2 has no way\
    \ to\n   know whether Client A is currently associated with the FQDN, or\n   whether\
    \ A is a different client configured with the same FQDN.  If\n   the servers cannot\
    \ distinguish between these situations, they cannot\n   enforce the site's naming\
    \ policies.\n"
- title: 4.  Use of the DHCID RR
  contents:
  - "4.  Use of the DHCID RR\n   A solution to both of these problems is for the updater\
    \ (a DHCP\n   client or DHCP server) to be able to determine which DHCP client\
    \ has\n   been associated with an FQDN, in order to offer administrators the\n\
    \   opportunity to configure updater behavior.\n   For this purpose, a DHCID RR,\
    \ specified in [2], is used to associate\n   client identification information\
    \ with an FQDN and the A, AAAA, and\n   PTR RRs associated with that FQDN.  When\
    \ either a client or server\n   adds A, AAAA, or PTR RRs for a client, it also\
    \ adds a DHCID RR that\n   specifies a unique client identity, based on data from\
    \ the client's\n   DHCP message.  In this model, only one client is associated\
    \ with a\n   given FQDN at a time.\n   By associating this ownership information\
    \ with each FQDN, cooperating\n   DNS updaters may determine whether their client\
    \ is currently\n   associated with a particular FQDN and implement the appropriately\n\
    \   configured administrative policy.  In addition, DHCP clients that\n   currently\
    \ have FQDNs may move from one DHCP server to another without\n   losing their\
    \ FQDNs.\n   The specific algorithm utilizing the DHCID RR to signal client\n\
    \   ownership is explained below.  The algorithm only works in the case\n   where\
    \ the updating entities all cooperate -- this approach is\n   advisory only and\
    \ is not a substitute for DNS security, nor is it\n   replaced by DNS security.\n"

  contents:
  - "5.1.  Error Return Codes\n   Certain RCODEs defined in [3] indicate that the\
    \ destination DNS\n   server cannot perform an update, i.e., FORMERR, SERVFAIL,\
    \ REFUSED,\n   NOTIMP.  If one of these RCODEs is returned, the updater MUST\n\
    \   terminate its update attempt.  Other RCODEs [13] may indicate that\n   there\
    \ are problems with the key being used and may mean to try a\n   different key,\
    \ if available, or to terminate the operation.  Because\n   some errors may indicate\
    \ a misconfiguration of the updater or the DNS\n   server, the updater MAY attempt\
    \ to signal to its administrator that\n   an error has occurred, e.g., through\
    \ a log message.\n"
- title: 5.2.  Dual IPv4/IPv6 Client Considerations
  contents:
  - "5.2.  Dual IPv4/IPv6 Client Considerations\n   At the time of publication of\
    \ this document, a small minority of DHCP\n   clients support both IPv4 and IPv6.\
    \  We anticipate, however, that a\n   transition will take place over a period\
    \ of time, and more sites will\n   have dual-stack clients present.  IPv6 clients\
    \ require updates of\n   AAAA RRs; IPv4 client require updates of A RRs.  The\
    \ administrators\n   of mixed deployments will likely wish to permit a single\
    \ FQDN to\n   contain A and AAAA RRs from the same client.\n   Sites that wish\
    \ to permit a single FQDN to contain both A and AAAA\n   RRs MUST make use of\
    \ DHCPv4 clients and servers that support using\n   the DHCP Unique Identifier\
    \ (DUID) for DHCPv4 client identifiers such\n   that this DUID is used in computing\
    \ the RDATA of the DHCID RR by both\n   DHCPv4 and DHCPv6 for the client; see\
    \ [11].  Otherwise, a dual-stack\n   client that uses older-style DHCPv4 client\
    \ identifiers (see [4] and\n   [12]) will only be able to have either its A or\
    \ AAAA records in DNS\n   under a single FQDN because of the DHCID RR conflicts\
    \ that result.\n"
- title: 5.3.  Adding A and/or AAAA RRs to DNS
  contents:
  - "5.3.  Adding A and/or AAAA RRs to DNS\n   When a DHCP client or server intends\
    \ to update A and/or AAAA RRs, it\n   starts with the UPDATE request in Section\
    \ 5.3.1.\n   As the update sequence below can result in loops, implementers SHOULD\n\
    \   limit the total number of attempts for a single transaction.\n"
- title: 5.3.1.  Initial DHCID RR Request
  contents:
  - "5.3.1.  Initial DHCID RR Request\n   The updater prepares a DNS UPDATE request\
    \ that includes as a\n   prerequisite the assertion that the FQDN does not exist.\
    \  The update\n   section of the request attempts to add the new FQDN and its\
    \ IP\n   address mapping (A and/or AAAA RRs) and the DHCID RR with its unique\n\

    \ FQDN is in use and proceeds to\n   Section 5.3.2.\n   If any other status is\
    \ returned, the updater SHOULD NOT attempt an\n   update (see Section 5.1).\n"
- title: 5.3.2.  DNS UPDATE When FQDN in Use
  contents:
  - "5.3.2.  DNS UPDATE When FQDN in Use\n   The updater next attempts to confirm\
    \ that the FQDN is not being used\n   by some other client by preparing an UPDATE\
    \ request in which there\n   are two prerequisites.  The first prerequisite is\
    \ that the FQDN\n   exists.  The second is that the desired FQDN has attached\
    \ to it a\n   DHCID RR whose contents match the client identity.  The update\n\
    \   section of the UPDATE request contains:\n   1.  A delete of any existing A\
    \ RRs on the FQDN if this is an A update\n       or an AAAA update and the updater\
    \ does not desire A records on\n       the FQDN, or if this update is adding an\
    \ A and the updater only\n       desires a single IP address on the FQDN.\n  \
    \ 2.  A delete of the existing AAAA RRs on the FQDN if the updater does\n    \
    \   not desire AAAA records on the FQDN, or if this update is adding\n       an\
    \ AAAA and the updater only desires a single IP address on the\n       FQDN.\n\
    \   3.  An add (or adds) of the A RR that matches the DHCP binding if\n      \
    \ this is an A update.\n   4.  Adds of the AAAA RRs that match the DHCP bindings\
    \ if this is an\n       AAAA update.\n   Whether A or AAAA RRs are deleted depends\
    \ on the updater or updater's\n   policy.  For example, if the updater is the\
    \ client or configured as\n   the only DHCP server for the link on which the client\
    \ is located, the\n   updater may find it beneficial to delete all A and/or AAAA\
    \ RRs and\n   then add the current set of A and/or AAAA RRs, if any, for the\n\
    \   client.\n   If the UPDATE request succeeds, the updater can conclude that\
    \ the\n   current client was the last client associated with the FQDN, and that\n\
    \   the FQDN now contains the updated A and/or AAAA RRs.  The update is\n   now\
    \ complete (and a client updater is finished, while a server would\n   then proceed\
    \ to perform a PTR RR update).\n   If the response to the UPDATE request returns\
    \ NXDOMAIN, the FQDN is\n   no longer in use, and the updater proceeds back to\
    \ Section 5.3.1.\n   If the response to the UPDATE request returns NXRRSET, there\
    \ are two\n   possibilities: there are no DHCID RRs for the FQDN, or the DHCID\
    \ RR\n   does not match.  In either case, the updater proceeds to\n   Section\
    \ 5.3.3.\n"

  contents:
  - "5.3.3.  FQDN in Use by Another Client\n   As the FQDN appears to be in use by\
    \ another client or is not\n   associated with any client, the updater SHOULD\

    \ FQDN or terminate\n   the update with a failure.\n   Techniques that may be\
    \ considered to disambiguate FQDNs include\n   adding some suffix or prefix to\
    \ the hostname portion of the FQDN or\n   randomly generating a hostname.\n"
- title: 5.4.  Adding PTR RR Entries to DNS
  contents:
  - "5.4.  Adding PTR RR Entries to DNS\n   The DHCP server submits a DNS UPDATE request\
    \ that deletes all of the\n   PTR RRs associated with the client's assigned IP\
    \ address and adds a\n   PTR RR whose data is the client's (possibly disambiguated)\
    \ FQDN.  The\n   server MAY also add a DHCID RR as specified in Section 4, in\
    \ which\n   case it would include a delete of all of the DHCID RRs associated\n\
    \   with the client's assigned IP address and would add a DHCID RR for\n   the\
    \ client.\n   There is no need to validate the DHCID RR for PTR updates as the\
    \ DHCP\n   server (or servers) only assigns an address to a single client at a\n\
    \   time.\n"
- title: 5.5.  Removing Entries from DNS
  contents:
  - "5.5.  Removing Entries from DNS\n   The most important consideration in removing\
    \ DNS entries is to be\n   sure that an entity removing a DNS entry is only removing\
    \ an entry\n   that it added, or for which an administrator has explicitly assigned\n\
    \   it responsibility.\n   When an address' lease time or valid lifetime expires\
    \ or a DHCP\n   client issues a DHCPRELEASE [4] or Release [5] request, the DHCP\n\
    \   server SHOULD delete the PTR RR that matches the DHCP binding, if one\n  \
    \ was successfully added.  The server's UPDATE request SHOULD assert\n   that\
    \ the domain name (PTRDNAME field) in the PTR record matches the\n   FQDN of the\
    \ client whose address has expired or been released and\n   should delete all\
    \ RRs for the FQDN.\n   The entity chosen to handle the A or AAAA records for\
    \ this client\n   (either the client or the server) SHOULD delete the A or AAAA\
    \ records\n   that were added when the address was assigned to the client.\n \
    \  However, the updater should only remove the DHCID RR if there are no\n   A\
    \ or AAAA RRs remaining for the client.\n   In order to perform this A or AAAA\
    \ RR delete, the updater prepares an\n   UPDATE request that contains a prerequisite\
    \ that asserts that the\n   DHCID RR exists whose data is the client identity\
    \ described in\n   Section 4 and contains an update section that deletes the client's\n\
    \   specific A or AAAA RR.\n   If the UPDATE request succeeds, the updater prepares\
    \ a second UPDATE\n   request that contains three prerequisites and an update\
    \ section that\n   deletes all RRs for the FQDN.  The first prerequisite asserts\
    \ that\n   the DHCID RR exists whose data is the client identity described in\n\
    \   Section 4.  The second prerequisite asserts that there are no A RRs.\n   The\
    \ third prerequisite asserts that there are no AAAA RRs.\n   If either request\
    \ fails, the updater MUST NOT delete the FQDN.  It\n   may be that the client\
    \ whose address has expired has moved to another\n   network and obtained an address\
    \ from a different server, which has\n   caused the client's A or AAAA RR to be\
    \ replaced.  Or, the DNS data\n   may have been removed or altered by an administrator.\n"

    \  Both\n   DHCP clients and servers SHOULD use some form of update request\n\
    \   authentication (e.g., TSIG [13]) when performing DNS updates.\n   Whether\
    \ a DHCP client may be responsible for updating an FQDN-to-IP-\n   address mapping,\
    \ or whether this is the responsibility of the DHCP\n   server, is a site-local\
    \ matter.  The choice between the two\n   alternatives may be based on the security\
    \ model that is used with the\n   Dynamic DNS Update protocol (e.g., only a client\
    \ may have sufficient\n   credentials to perform updates to the FQDN-to-IP-address\
    \ mapping for\n   its FQDN).\n   Whether a DHCP server is always responsible for\

    \ DHCP server should be sure of the FQDN to\n   use for the client, and of the\
    \ identity of the client.\n   Currently, it is difficult for DHCP servers to develop\
    \ much\n   confidence in the identities of their clients, given the absence of\n\
    \   entity authentication from the DHCP protocol itself.  There are many\n   ways\
    \ for a DHCP server to develop an FQDN to use for a client, but\n   only in certain\
    \ relatively rare circumstances will the DHCP server\n   know for certain the\
    \ identity of the client.  If [14] becomes widely\n   deployed, this may become\
    \ more customary.\n   One example of a situation that offers some extra assurances\
    \ is when\n   the DHCP client is connected to a network through a DOCSIS cable\n\
    \   modem, and the Cable Modem Termination System (head-end) of the cable\n  \
    \ modem ensures that MAC address spoofing simply does not occur.\n   Another example\
    \ of a configuration that might be trusted is when\n   clients obtain network\
    \ access via a network access server using PPP.\n   The Network Access Server\
    \ (NAS) itself might be obtaining IP\n   addresses via DHCP, encoding client identification\
    \ into the DHCP\n   client-id option.  In this case, the NAS as well as the DHCP\
    \ server\n   might be operating within a trusted environment, in which case the\n\
    \   DHCP server could be configured to trust that the user authentication\n  \
    \ and authorization processing of the NAS was sufficient, and would\n   therefore\
    \ trust the client identification encoded within the DHCP\n   client-id.\n"
