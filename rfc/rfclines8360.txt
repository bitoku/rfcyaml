Abstract This document specifies an alternative to the certificate validation procedure specified in RFC 6487 that reduces aspects of operational fragility in the management of certificates in the Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI), while retaining essential security features.
The procedure specified in RFC 6487 requires that Resource Certificates are rejected entirely if they are found to overclaim any resources not contained on the issuing certificate, whereas the validation process defined here allows an issuing Certification Authority (CA) to chose to communicate that such Resource Certificates should be accepted for the intersection of their resources and the issuing certificate.
It should be noted that the validation process defined here considers validation under a single trust anchor (TA) only.
In particular, concerns regarding overclaims where multiple configured TAs claim overlapping resources are considered out of scope for this document.
This choice is signaled by a set of alternative Object Identifiers (OIDs) per "X.509 Extensions for IP Addresses and AS Identifiers" (RFC 3779) and "Certificate Policy (CP) for the Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI)" (RFC 6484).
It should be noted that in case these OIDs are not used for any certificate under a trust anchor, the validation procedure defined here has the same outcome as the procedure defined in RFC 6487.
Furthermore, this document provides an alternative to Route Origin Authorization (ROA) (RFC 6482) and BGPsec Router Certificate (BGPsec PKI Profiles   publication requested) validation.
This document specifies an alternative to the certificate validation procedure specified in RFC 6487.
Where the procedure specified in RFC 6487 will require that Resource Certificates be rejected entirely if they are found to overclaim any resources not contained on the issuing certificate, the procedure defined here dictates that these Resource Certificates be accepted for the intersection of their resources and the issuing certificate only.
The outcome of both procedures is the same as long as no overclaims occur.
Furthermore, the new procedure can never lead to the acceptance of resources that are not validly held on the path of issuing certificates.
However, the procedure defined here will limit the impact in case resources are no longer validly held on the path of issuing certificates to attestations, such as Route Origin Authorizations [RFC6482] that refer to these resources only. 1.1.
The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14
when, and only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here.
Certificate Validation in the RPKI
As currently defined in Section 7.2 of [RFC6487], validation of PKIX certificates that conform to the RPKI profile relies on the use of a path validation process where each certificate in the validation path is required to meet the certificate validation criteria.
These criteria require, in particular, that the Internet Number Resources (INRs) of each certificate in the validation path are "encompassed" by INRs on the issuing certificate.
The first certificate in the path is required to be a trust anchor, and its resources are considered valid by definition.
For example, in the following sequence: Certificate 1 (trust anchor): Issuer TA, Subject TA, Resources 192.0.2.0/24, 198.51.100.0/24, 2001:db8::/32, AS64496 AS64500 Certificate 2:
Issuer TA, Subject CA1, Resources 192.0.2.0/24, 198.51.100.0/24, 2001:db8::/32 Certificate 3:
Issuer CA1, Subject CA2, Resources 192.0.2.0/24, 198.51.100.0/24, 2001:db8::/32 ROA 1: Embedded Certificate 4 (EE certificate): Issuer CA2, Subject R1, Resources 192.0.2.0/24 Prefix 192.0.2.0/24, Max Length 24, ASN 64496
All certificates in this scenario are considered valid since the INRs of each certificate are encompassed by those of the issuing certificate.
ROA1 is valid because the specified prefix is encompassed by the embedded end entity (EE) certificate, as required by [RFC6482].
The allocations recorded in the RPKI change as a result of resource transfers.
For example, the CAs involved in transfer might choose to modify CA certificates in an order that causes some of these certificates to "overclaim" temporarily.
A certificate is said to "overclaim" if it includes INRs not contained in the INRs of the CA that issued the certificate in question.
It may also happen that a child CA does not voluntarily request a shrunk Resource Certificate when resources are being transferred or reclaimed by the parent.
Furthermore, operational errors that may occur during management of RPKI databases also may create CA certificates that, temporarily, no longer encompass all of the INRs of subordinate certificates.
Certificate 1 (trust anchor): Issuer TA, Subject TA, Resources 192.0.2.0/24, 198.51.100.0/24, 2001:
db8::/32, AS64496 AS64500 Certificate 2:
Issuer TA, Subject CA1, Resources 192.0.2.0/24, 2001:db8::/32 Certificate 3 (invalid): Issuer CA1, Subject CA2, Resources 192.0.2.0/24, 198.51.100.0/24, 2001:db8::/32 ROA 1 (invalid): Embedded Certificate 4 (EE certificate, invalid): Issuer CA2, Subject R1, Resources 192.0.2.0/24 Prefix 192.0.2.0/24, Max Length 24, ASN 64496
Here, Certificate 2 from the previous example was reissued by TA to CA1, and the prefix 198.51.100.0/24 was removed.
However, CA1 failed to reissue a new Certificate 3 to CA2.
As a result, Certificate 3 is now overclaiming and considered invalid; by recursion, the embedded Certificate 4 used for ROA1 is also invalid.
And ROA1 is invalid because the specified prefix contained in the ROA is no longer encompassed by a valid embedded EE certificate, as required by [RFC6482].
However, it should be noted that ROA1 does not make use of any of the address resources that were removed from CA1's certificate; thus, it would be desirable if ROA1 could still be viewed as valid.
Technically, CA1 should reissue a Certificate 3 to CA2 without 198.51.100.0/24, and then ROA1 would be considered valid according to [RFC6482].
But as long as CA1 does not take this action, ROA1 remains invalid.
It would be preferable if ROA1 could be considered valid, since the assertion it makes was not affected by the reduced scope of CA1's certificate.
An Amended RPKI Certification Validation Process 4.1.
The problem described above can be considered a low probability problem today.
However, the potential impact on routing security would be high if an overclaiming occurred near the apex of the RPKI hierarchy, as this would invalidate the entirety of the subtree located below this point.
The changes specified here to the validation procedure in [RFC6487] do not change the probability of this problem, but they do limit the impact to just the overclaimed resources.
This revised validation algorithm is intended to avoid causing CA certificates to be treated as completely invalid as a result of overclaims.
However, these changes are designed to not degrade the security offered by the RPKI.
Specifically, ROAs and router certificates will be treated as valid only if all of the resources contained in them are encompassed by all superior certificates along a path to a trust anchor.
The way this is achieved conceptually is by maintaining a Verified Resource Set (VRS) for each certificate that is separate from the INRs found in the resource extension [RFC3779] in the certificate.
Differences with Existing Standards 4.2.1.
Certificate Policy (CP) for Use with Validation Reconsidered in the RPKI Note that Section 1.2 of [RFC6484] defines the "Certificate Policy (CP) for the Resource PKI (RPKI)" with the following OID:
cp(14) 2 } Per this document, a new OID for an alternative "Certificate Policy (CP) for use with validation reconsidered in the Resource PKI (RPKI)" has been assigned as follows:
} This alternative Certificate Policy is the same as the Certificate Policy described in [RFC6484], except that it is used to drive the decision in Step 8 of the validation procedure described in Section 4.2.4.4.
An Alternative to X.509 Extensions for IP Addresses and AS Identifiers (RFC 3779)
This document defines an alternative to [RFC3779].
All specifications and procedures described in [RFC3779] apply, with the notable exceptions described in the following subsections.

An Alternative to the Profile for X.509 PKIX Resource Certificates
This document defines an alternative profile for X.509 PKIX Resource Certificates.
This profile follows all definitions and procedures described in [RFC6487] with the following notable exceptions.
The following is an amended specification to be used in this profile, in place of Section 4.8.9 of [RFC6487].
This extension MUST be present and MUST be marked critical.
It MUST include exactly one policy of type
id cp ipAddr asNumber v2, as specified in the updated RPKI CP in Section 4.2.1.
The following is an amended specification to be used in this profile, in place of Section 4.8.10 of [RFC6487].
Either the IP resources extension or the AS resources extension, or both, MUST be present in all RPKI certificates and MUST be marked critical.
This extension contains the list of IP address resources as per Section 4.2.2.1.
The value may specify the "inherit" element for a particular Address Family Identifier (AFI) value.
In the context of Resource Certificates describing public number resources for use in the public Internet, the Subsequent AFI (SAFI) value MUST NOT be used.
This extension MUST either specify a non empty set of IP address records or use the "inherit" setting to indicate that the IP address resource set of this certificate is inherited from that of the certificate's issuer.
The following is an amended specification to be used in this profile, in place of Section 4.8.11 of [RFC6487].
Either the AS resources extension or the IP resources extension, or both, MUST be present in all RPKI certificates and MUST be marked critical.
This extension contains the list of AS number resources as per Section 4.2.2.3, or it may specify the "inherit" element.
Routing Domain Identifier (RDI) values are NOT supported in this profile and MUST NOT be used.
This extension MUST either specify a non empty set of AS number records or use the "inherit" setting to indicate that the AS number resource set of this certificate is inherited from that of the certificate's issuer.
Amended Resource Certificate Path Validation
The following is an amended specification for path validation to be used in place of Section 7.2 of [RFC6487], which allows for the validation of both certificates following the profile defined in [RFC6487], as well as certificates following the profile described above.
The following algorithm is employed to validate CA and EE resource certificates.
It is modeled on the path validation algorithm from [RFC5280] but is modified to make use of the IP Address Delegation and AS Identifier Delegation extensions from [RFC3779].
There are two inputs to the validation algorithm: 1.
a certificate to be validated The algorithm is initialized with two new variables for use in the RPKI: Verified Resource Set IP (VRS IP) and Verified Resource Set AS (VRS AS).
These sets are used to track the set of INRs (IP address space and AS numbers) that are considered valid for each CA certificate.
The VRS IP and VRS AS sets are initially set to the IP Address Delegation and AS Identifier Delegation values, respectively, from the trust anchor used to perform validation.
x' is the issuer of certificate ('x'   1); b.  certificate '1' is issued by a trust anchor; c.  certificate 'n' is the certificate to be validated; and d.  for all 'x
Certificate validation requires verifying that all of the following conditions hold, in addition to the certification path validation criteria specified in Section 6 of [RFC5280].
(x>1) is verified using the public key of the issuer's certificate (x 1), using the signature algorithm specified for that public key (in certificate x 1).
The current time lies within the interval defined by the NotBefore and NotAfter values in the Validity field of certificate x. 3.
The Version, Issuer, and Subject fields of certificate
x satisfy the constraints established in Sections 4.1 to 4.7 of RFC 6487.
If certificate x uses the Certificate Policy defined in Section 4.8.9 of [RFC6487], then the certificate MUST contain all extensions defined in Section 4.8 of [RFC6487] that must be present.
The value(s) for each of these extensions MUST satisfy the constraints established for each extension in the respective sections.
Any extension not thus identified MUST NOT appear in certificate x. 5.
If certificate x uses the Certificate Policy defined in Section 4.2.4.1, then all extensions defined in Section 4.8 of [RFC6487], except Sections 4.8.9, 4.8.10, and 4.8.11 MUST be present.
The certificate MUST contain an extension as defined in Sections 4.2.4.2 or 4.2.4.3, or both.
The value(s) for each of these extensions MUST satisfy the constraints established for each extension in the respective sections.
Any extension not thus identified MUST NOT appear in certificate x. 6.
Certificate x MUST NOT have been revoked, i.e., it MUST NOT appear on a Certificate Revocation List (CRL) issued by the CA represented by certificate x 1
and x 1, set the VRS IP to the resources found in this extension.
If the IP Address Delegation extension is present in certificate x and x>1, set the VRS IP to the intersection of the resources between this extension and the value of the VRS IP computed for certificate x 1.
If the IP Address Delegation extension is absent in certificate x, set the VRS IP to NULL.
If the IP Address Delegation extension is present in certificate
and x 1, set the VRS IP to the resources found in this extension.
If the AS Identifier Delegation extension is present in certificate x and x>1, set the VRS AS to the intersection of the resources between this extension and the value of the VRS AS computed for certificate x 1.
If the AS Identifier Delegation extension is absent in certificate x, set the VRS AS to NULL.
If there is any difference in resources in the VRS IP and the IP Address Delegation extension on certificate x, or the VRS AS and the AS Identifier Delegation extension on certificate x, then:
If certificate x uses the Certificate Policy defined in Section 4.2.4.1, a warning listing the overclaiming resources for certificate x SHOULD be issued.
If certificate x uses the Certificate Policy defined in Section 4.8.9 of [RFC6487], then certificate x MUST be rejected.
These rules allow a CA certificate to contain resources that are not present in (all of)
the certificates along the path from the trust anchor to the CA certificate.
If none of the resources in the CA certificate are present in all certificates along the path, no subordinate certificates could be valid.
However, the certificate is not immediately rejected as this may be a transient condition.
Not immediately rejecting the certificate does not result in a security problem because the associated VRS sets accurately reflect the resources validly associated with the certificate in question.
An Alternative ROA Validation Section 4 of [RFC6482] currently has the following text on the validation of resources on a ROA:
The IP address delegation extension [RFC3779] is present in the end entity (EE) certificate (contained within the ROA), and each IP address prefix(es) in the ROA is contained within the set of IP addresses specified by the EE certificate's IP address delegation extension.
If the end entity certificate uses the Certificate Policy defined in Section 4.2.4.1, then the following approach must be used instead.
The amended IP Address Delegation extension described in Section 4.2.4.2 is present in the end entity (EE) certificate (contained within the ROA), and each IP address prefix(es) in the ROA is contained within the VRS IP set that is specified as an outcome of EE certificate validation described in Section 4.2.4.4.
Note that this ensures that ROAs can be valid only if all IP address prefixes in the ROA are encompassed by the VRS IP of all certificates along the path to the trust anchor used to verify it.
Operators MAY issue separate ROAs for each IP address prefix, so that the loss of one or more IP address prefixes from the VRS IP of any certificate along the path to the trust anchor would not invalidate authorizations for other IP address prefixes.
An Alternative to BGPsec Router Certificate Validation
If a BGPsec Router Certificate [RFC8209] uses the Certificate Policy defined in Section 4.2.4.1, then in addition to the BGPsec Router Certificate Validation defined in Section 3.3 of [RFC8209], the following constraint MUST be met:
The VRS AS of BGPsec Router Certificates MUST encompass all Autonomous System Numbers (ASNs) in the AS Resource Identifier Delegation extension.
Operators MAY issue separate BGPsec Router Certificates for different ASNs, so that the loss of an ASN from the VRS AS of any certificate along the path to the trust anchor would not invalidate router keys for other ASNs.
In this section, we will demonstrate the outcome of RPKI validation performed using the algorithm and procedures described in Sections 4.2.4.4, 4.2.5, and 4.2.6, under three deployment scenarios:  An RPKI tree consisting of certificates using the old OIDs only  An RPKI tree consisting of certificates using the new OIDs only  An RPKI tree consisting of a mix of certificates using either the old or the new OIDs
In this context, we refer to a certificate as using the 'old' OIDs, if the certificate uses a combination of the OIDs defined in Section 1.2 of [RFC6484], Section 2.2.1 of [RFC3779], and/or Section 3.2.1 of [RFC3779].
We refer to a certificate as using the 'new' OIDS, if the certificate uses a combination of OIDs defined in Sections 4.2.4.1, 4.2.2.1, and/or Section 4.2.2.3.
An RPKI Tree Using the Old OIDs Only Consider the following example: Certificate 1 (trust anchor)
TA, OIDs: OLD, Resources: 0/0, ::0, AS0 4294967295

ROA2 is considered invalid because Certificate 3 is invalid.

An RPKI Tree Using the New OIDs Only Consider the following example under the amended approach: Certificate 1 (trust anchor)
TA, OIDs: NEW, Resources: 0/0, ::0, AS0 4294967295
(all resources) Verified Resource Set: 0/0, :

AS64496 BGPsec Certificate 2 is invalid because not all of its resources are contained in the Verified Resource Set.
Note that this problem can be mitigated by issuing separate certificates for each AS number.
An RPKI Tree Using a Mix of Old and New OIDs
In the following example, new OIDs are used only for CA certificates where the issuing CA anticipates that an overclaim could occur and has a desire to limit the impact of this to just the overclaimed resources in question: Certificate 1 (trust anchor)
TA, OIDs: OLD, Resources: 0/0, ::0, AS0 4294967295
(all resources) Verified Resource Set: 0/0, :
:0, AS0 4294967295 (all resources
) Warnings: none Note that a trust anchor certificate cannot be found to overclaim.
So, using the new OIDs here would not change anything with regards to the validity of this certificate.
Subject: CA1, OIDs: OLD, Resources: 192.0.2.0/24, 2001:
db8::/32, AS64496 Verified Resource Set: 192.0.2.0/24, 2001:
, AS64496 Warnings: none Note that since the TA certificate claims all resources, it is impossible to issue a certificate below it that could be found to be overclaiming.
Therefore, there is no benefit in using the new OIDs for Certificate 2.
Certificate 3: Issuer: CA1, Subject: CA2, OIDs: NEW,
, AS64496 Verified Resource Set: 192.0.2.0/24
, AS64496 Warnings: overclaim for 198.51.100.0/24 Note that CA1 anticipated that it might invalid Certificate 3 issued to CA2, if its own resources on Certificate 2 were modified and old OIDs were used on Certificate 3.
Embedded Certificate 4 (EE certificate): Issuer: CA2, Subject: R1, OIDs: OLD, Resources: 192.0.2.0/24 Prefix 192.0.2.0/24, Max Length 24, ASN 64496
192.0.2.0/24 Warnings: none ROA1 is considered valid because the prefix matches the Verified Resource Set on the embedded EE certificate.
ROA 2 (invalid): Embedded Certificate 5 (EE certificate invalid): Issuer: CA2, Subject: R2, OIDs: OLD,
Prefix 198.51.100.0/24, Max Length 24, ASN 64496 Verified Resource Set: none (empty set)
ROA2 is considered invalid because resources on its EE certificate contains 198.51.100.0/24, which is not contained in its Verified Resource Set.
Note that if new OIDs were used here (as in example 2), ROA 2 would be considered invalid because the prefix is not contained in the Verified Resource Set.
So, if there is no difference in the validity outcome, one could argue that using old OIDs here is clearest, because any overclaim of ROA prefixes MUST result in it being considered invalid (as described in Section 4.2.5).
BGPsec Certificate 1 (valid): Issuer: CA2, Subject: ROUTER 64496, OIDs: OLD,
AS64496 Warnings: none BGPsec Certificate 2 (invalid): Issuer: CA2, Subject:
ALL ROUTERS, OIDs: OLD, Resources:
AS64496 AS64497 Verified Resource Set:
AS64496 BGPsec Certificate 2 is considered invalid because resources contains AS64497, which is not contained in its Verified Resource Set.
Note that if new OIDs were used here (as in example 2), BGPsec Certificate 2 would be considered invalid because the prefix is not contained in the Verified Resource Set.
So, if there is no difference in the validity outcome, one could argue that using old OIDs here is the clearest, because any overclaim on this certificate MUST result in it being considered invalid (as described in Section 4.2.6).
Also note that, as in example 2, this problem can be mitigated by issuing separate certificates for each AS number.
This document defines an alternative RPKI validation algorithm, but it does not dictate how this algorithm will be deployed.
This should be discussed as a separate effort.
That said, the following observations may help this discussion.
Because this document introduces new OIDs and an alternative to the profile for X.509 PKIX Resource Certificates described in [RFC6487], the use of such certificates in the global RPKI will lead to the rejection of such certificates by Relying Party tools that do not (yet) implement the alternative profile described in this document.
For this reason, it is important that such tools are updated before Certification Authorities start to use this specification.
However, because the OIDs are defined in each RPKI certificate, there is no strict requirement for all Certification Authorities, or even for all the certificates they issue, to migrate to the new OIDs at the same time.
The example in Section 5.3 illustrates a possible deployment where the new OIDs are used only in CA certificates where an accidental overclaim may occur.
The authors believe that the revised validation algorithm introduces no new security vulnerabilities into the RPKI, because it cannot lead to any ROA and/or router certificates to be accepted if they contain resources that are not held by the issuer.
