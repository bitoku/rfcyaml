- title: 1. Introduction
  contents:
  - "1. Introduction\n   This document defines the policies and procedures for inserting\n\
    \   Naming Authority Pointer (NAPTR) records into the 'URI.ARPA' and\n   'URN.ARPA'\
    \ zones for the purpose of resolving Uniform Resource\n   Identifiers (URIs) according\
    \ to \"Dynamic Delegation Discovery System\n   (DDDS) Part Four:  The URI Resolution\
    \ Application\" (RFC 3402) [2],\n   which is an Application that uses the Domain\
    \ Name System (DNS) based\n   DDDS Database.  All of these concepts are defined\
    \ in RFC 3401 [1].\n   It is very important to note that it is impossible to correctly\n\
    \   understand this document without reading RFC 3401 and the documents\n   it\
    \ specifies.\n   RFC 3403 defines a how DNS is used as a DDDS database that contains\n\
    \   URI delegation rules (sometimes called resolution hints).  That\n   document\
    \ specifies that the first step in that algorithm is to append\n   'URI.ARPA'\
    \ to the URI scheme and retrieve the NAPTR record for that\n   domain-name.  I.e.,\
    \ the first step in resolving \"http://foo.com/\"\n   would be to look up a NAPTR\
    \ record for the domain \"http.URI.ARPA\".\n   URN resolution also follows a similar\
    \ procedure but uses the\n   'URN.ARPA' zone as its root.  This document describes\
    \ the procedures\n   for inserting a new rule into the 'URI.ARPA' and 'URN.ARPA'\
    \ zones.\n"
- title: 2. URI Resolution vs URN Resolution
  contents:
  - "2. URI Resolution vs URN Resolution\n   RFC 3402 [2] defines how both URI [7]\
    \ resolution and URN [6]\n   resolution work when DNS is used as the delegation\
    \ rule (or hint)\n   database.  Specifically it says that the initial instructions\n\
    \   ('hints') for DNS-based resolution of URIs are stored as resource\n   records\
    \ in the 'URI.ARPA' DNS zone.\n   Since a URN is a URI scheme, a hint for resolution\
    \ of the URI prefix\n   'urn:' will also be stored in the 'URI.ARPA' zone.  This\
    \ rule states\n   that the namespace id [6] is extracted, 'URN.ARPA' is appended\
    \ to the\n   end of the namespace id, and the result is used as the key for\n\
    \   retrieval of a subsequent NAPTR record [4].\n"
- title: 3. Registration Policies
  contents:
  - "3. Registration Policies\n   The creation of a given URI scheme or URN namespace\
    \ id (NID) follows\n   the appropriate registration documents for those spaces.\
    \  URI schemes\n   follow \"Registration Procedures for URL Scheme Names\" (RFC\
    \ 2717)\n   [10].  URN namespace ids follow \"URN Namespace Definition Mechanisms\"\
    \n   (RFC 2611) (or updates thereto) [9].\n"

    \ or its designated\n   expert will review the request for\n      1.  correctness\
    \ and technical soundness\n      2.  consistency with the published URI specification,\
    \ and\n      3.  to ensure that the NAPTR record for a DNS-based URI does not\n\
    \          delegate resolution of the URI to a party other than the\n        \
    \  holder of the DNS name.  This last rule is to insure that a\n          given\

- title: 4. Requirements on hints
  contents:
  - "4. Requirements on hints\n   Delegation of a namespace can happen in two ways.\
    \  In the case of\n   most URIs, the key being delegated to is hard-coded into\
    \ the\n   identifier itself (e.g., a hostname in an HTTP URI).  The syntax of\n\
    \   where this new key is located is predetermined by the syntax of the\n   scheme.\
    \  In other cases, the new key can be part of the hint itself.\n   This is the\
    \ functional equivalent of saying, \"if this rule matches\n   then this is always\
    \ the key.\"\n   In order to minimize the query load on the URI.ARPA and URN.ARPA\n\
    \   zones, it is anticipated that the resource records in those zones\n   will\
    \ have extremely long \"times to live\" (TTLs), perhaps measured in\n   years.\n\
    \   Thus, for any URI prefix or URN namespace for which the resolution\n   hints\
    \ are likely to change, the actual rule should be stored in some\n   other (less\
    \ stable) DNS zone, and within URI.ARPA or URN.ARPA a\n   stable NAPTR record\
    \ should be used to delegate queries to that less\n   stable zone.\n   For example,\
    \ the 'foo' URN namespace has flexible rules for how\n   delegation takes place.\
    \  Instead of putting those rules in the\n   URN.ARPA zone, the entry instead\
    \ punts those rules off to a\n   nameserver that has a shorter time to live. \
    \ The record in URN.ARPA\n   would look like this:\n      foo     IN NAPTR 100\
    \ 10  \"\"  \"\" \"\" urn-resolver.foo.com.\n   Thus, when the client starts out\
    \ in the resolution process, the first\n   step will be to query foo.URN.ARPA\
    \ to find the above record, the\n   second step is to begin asking 'urn-resolver.foo.com'\
    \ for the NAPTR\n   records that contain the resolution rules.  The TTL at the\
    \ root is\n   very long.  The TTL at the 'urn-resolver.foo.com' is much shorter.\n\
    \   Conversely, the 'http' URI scheme adheres to a particular syntax that\n  \
    \ specifies that the host to ask is specified in the URI in question.\n   Since\
    \ this syntax does not change, that rule can be specified in the\n   URI.ARPA\
    \ zone.  The record would look like this:\n      http    IN NAPTR 100 100 \"\"\
    \ \"\"  \"/http:\\\\/\\\\/([^\\\\/:]+)/\\\\2/i\" .\n   Thus, the second step of\
    \ resolution is to use the domain-name found\n   in the URI as the next key in\
    \ the cycle.  If, for example, that NAPTR\n   was terminal and contains some hostname\
    \ in the replacement field,\n   then the client could contact that host in order\
    \ to ask questions\n   about this particular URI.\n"
- title: 5. Submission Procedure
  contents:
  - "5. Submission Procedure\n   Using the MIME Content-Type registration  mechanism\
    \ [8] as a model\n   for a successful registration mechanism, the 'URI.ARPA' and\n\
    \   'URN.ARPA' procedures consist of a request template submitted to an\n   open\
    \ mailing list made up of interested parties.  If no objections\n   are made within\
    \ a two week period, a representative of the\n   registration authority considers\
    \ the submission to be accepted and\n   enters that submission into the nameserver.\n\
    \       o  Registrations for the 'URI.ARPA' zone are sent to\n           'register@URI.ARPA'.\n\
    \       o  Registrations for the 'URN.ARPA' zone are sent to\n           'register@URN.ARPA'.\n\
    \       The registration authority is the Internet Assigned Numbers\n       Authority\
    \ (IANA).\n   Objections are restricted to those that point out impacts on the\
    \ zone\n   itself or to DNS in general.  Objections to the URI scheme or to the\n\
    \   URN namespace-id are not allowed, as these should be raised in their\n   respective\
    \ forums.  The logical conclusion of this is that ANY\n   sanctioned URI scheme\
    \ or URN namespace MUST be allowed to be\n   registered if it meets the requirements\
    \ specified in this document as\n   regards times to live and general impact to\
    \ the DNS.\n"
