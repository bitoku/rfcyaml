- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   DNSSEC Lookaside Validation (DLV) was introduced to assist\
    \ with the\n   adoption of DNSSEC [RFC4033] [RFC4034] [RFC4035] in a time when\
    \ the\n   root zone and many top-level domains (TLDs) were unsigned.  DLV\n  \
    \ allowed entities with signed zones under an unsigned parent zone or\n   entities\
    \ with registrars that did not accept DS records to publish\n   trust anchors\
    \ outside of the normal DNS delegation chain.  The root\n   zone was signed in\
    \ July 2010, and as of May 2019, 1389 out of 1531\n   TLDs have a secure delegation\
    \ from the root; thus, DLV has served its\n   purpose and can now retire.\n"
- title: 2.  Requirements Language
  contents:
  - "2.  Requirements Language\n   The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\"\
    , \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"\
    NOT RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and\n   \"OPTIONAL\" in this document are to be interpreted\
    \ as described in\n   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear\
    \ in all\n   capitals, as shown here.\n"
- title: 3.  Discussion
  contents:
  - "3.  Discussion\n   One could argue that DLV is still useful because there are\
    \ still some\n   unsigned TLDs and entities under those zones that will not benefit\n\
    \   from signing their zone.  However, keeping the DLV mechanism also has\n  \
    \ disadvantages:\n   *  It reduces the pressure to get the parent zone signed.\n\
    \   *  It reduces the pressure on registrars to accept DS records.\n   *  It complicates\
    \ validation code.\n   In addition, not every validator actually implemented DLV\
    \ (only BIND\n   9 and Unbound), so even if an entity can use DLV to set up an\n\
    \   alternate path to its trust anchor, its effect is limited.\n   Furthermore,\
    \ there was one well-known DLV registry (dlv.isc.org),\n   which was deprecated\
    \ (replaced with a signed empty zone) on September\n   30, 2017.  With the absence\
    \ of a well-known DLV registry service, it\n   is unlikely that there is a real\
    \ benefit for the protocol on the\n   Internet nowadays.\n   One other possible\
    \ reason to keep DLV is to distribute trust anchors\n   for private enterprises.\
    \  There are no known uses of DLV for this.\n   All things considered, it is probably\
    \ not worth the effort of\n   maintaining the DLV mechanism.\n"
- title: 4.  Moving DLV to Historic Status
  contents:
  - "4.  Moving DLV to Historic Status\n   There are two RFCs that specify DLV:\n\
    \   1.  RFC 4431 [RFC4431] specifies the DLV resource record.\n   2.  RFC 5074\
    \ [RFC5074] specifies the DLV mechanism for publishing\n       trust anchors outside\
    \ the DNS delegation chain and how validators\n       can use them to validate\
    \ DNSSEC-signed data.\n   This document moves both RFC 4431 [RFC4431] and RFC\
    \ 5074 [RFC5074] to\n   Historic status.  This is a clear signal to implementers\
    \ that the DLV\n   resource record and the DLV mechanism SHOULD NOT be implemented\
    \ or\n   deployed.\n"
- title: 4.1.  Documents That Reference the DLV RFCs
  contents:
  - "4.1.  Documents That Reference the DLV RFCs\n   The RFCs being moved to Historic\
    \ status are referenced by a couple of\n   other RFCs.  The sections below describe\
    \ the changes to those\n   documents due to the DLV RFCs being reclassified as\
    \ Historic.\n"
- title: 4.1.1.  Documents That Reference RFC 4431
  contents:
  - "4.1.1.  Documents That Reference RFC 4431\n   One RFC makes reference to RFC\
    \ 4431 [RFC4431].\n"
- title: 4.1.1.1.  RFC 5074
  contents:
  - "4.1.1.1.  RFC 5074\n   RFC 5074 (\"DNSSEC Lookaside Validation (DLV)\") [RFC5074]\
    \ describes\n   the DLV mechanism itself.  This document moves RFC 5074 [RFC5074]\
    \ to\n   Historic status as well.\n"

- title: 4.1.2.1.  RFC 6698
  contents:
  - "4.1.2.1.  RFC 6698\n   RFC 6698 (\"The DNS-Based Authentication of Named Entities\
    \ (DANE)\n   Transport Layer Security (TLS) Protocol: TLSA\") [RFC6698] specifies:\n\
    \   |  DNSSEC forms certificates (the binding of an identity to a key) by\n  \
    \ |  combining a DNSKEY, DS, or DLV resource record with an associated\n   | \
    \ RRSIG record.  These records then form a signing chain extending\n   |  from\
    \ the client's trust anchors to the RR of interest.\n   This document updates\
    \ RFC 6698 [RFC6698] to exclude the DLV resource\n   record from certificates.\n"
- title: 4.1.2.2.  RFC 6840
  contents:
  - "4.1.2.2.  RFC 6840\n   RFC 6840 (\"Clarifications and Implementation Notes for\
    \ DNS Security\n   (DNSSEC)\") [RFC6840] states that when trust anchors come from\n\
    \   different sources, a validator may choose between them based on the\n   perceived\
    \ reliability of those sources.  But in reality, this does\n   not happen in validators\
    \ (both BIND 9 and Unbound have an option for\n   a DLV trust anchor that can\
    \ be used solely as a fallback).\n   This document updates RFC 6840 [RFC6840]\
    \ to exclude the DLV\n   registries from the trust anchor selection.\n"
- title: 4.1.2.3.  RFC 8198
  contents:
  - "4.1.2.3.  RFC 8198\n   RFC 8198 (\"Aggressive Use of DNSSEC-Validated Cache\"\
    ) [RFC8198] only\n   references RFC 5074 [RFC5074] because aggressive negative\
    \ caching was\n   first proposed there.\n"
- title: 5.  IANA Considerations
  contents:
  - "5.  IANA Considerations\n   IANA has updated the annotation of the DLV RR type\
    \ (code 32769) to\n   \"Obsolete\" in the \"Domain Name System (DNS) Parameters\"\
    \ registry.\n"
- title: 6.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "6.  Security Considerations\n   Once the DLV mechanism is retired, zones that\
    \ rely on DLV for their\n   validation will be treated as insecure.  The chance\
    \ that this\n   scenario actually occurs is very low, since no well-known DLV\n\
    \   registry exists.\n"
