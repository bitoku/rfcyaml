The Current Flow control Scheme for IMPSYS.
While Vint's notes on IMPSYS flow control from the March 16, 1972, meeting (RFC 442) seem reasonably accurate and while he does cite our Quarterly Technical Report #13, he might have done better to cite BBN's two formal publications relevant to the IMPSYS flow control scheme: 1.
McQuillan et al, Improvements in the Design and Performance of the ARPA Network, Proceedings AFIPS 1972 FJCC, pp.
BBN Report 1822, Specifications for the Interconnection of a Host and an IMP, December 1972 Revision, section 3, pp.
things have recently changed somewhat.
The inter IMP acknowledgement mechanism, described in the last section of Vint's RFC 442, is also described in reference 1 and an almost identical mechanism is described in Appendix F of reference 2.
The acknowledgement is of only intellectual interest to most Hosts as it is transparent to network users.
However, the description in reference 2 is of vital interest to so called Very Distant Hosts.
