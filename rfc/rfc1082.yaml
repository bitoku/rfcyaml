  - "Status of This Memo\n   This memo suggests a simple method for workstations to\
    \ dynamically\n   access mail from a discussion group server, as an extension\
    \ to an\n   earlier memo which dealt with dynamically accessing mail from a\n\
    \   mailbox server using the Post Office Protocol -  Version 3 (POP3).\n   This\
    \ RFC specifies a proposed protocol for the Internet community,\n   and requests\
    \ discussion and suggestions for improvements.  All of the\n   extensions described\
    \ in this memo to the POP3 are OPTIONAL.\n   Distribution of this memo is unlimited.\n"
- title: Introduction and Motivation
  contents:
  - "Introduction and Motivation\n   It is assumed that the reader is familiar with\
    \ RFC 1081 that\n   discusses the Post Office Protocol - Version 3 (POP3) [RFC1081].\n\
    \   This memo describes extensions to the POP3 which enhance the service\n   it\
    \ offers to clients.  This additional service permits a client host\n   to access\
    \ discussion group mail, which is often kept in a separate\n   spool area, using\
    \ the general POP3 facilities.\n   The next section describes the evolution of\
    \ discussion groups and the\n   technologies currently used to implement them.\
    \  To summarize:\n       o An exploder is used to map from a single address to\n\
    \       a list of addresses which subscribe to the list, and redirects\n     \
    \  any subsequent error reports associated with the delivery of\n       each message.\
    \  This has two primary advantages:\n             - Subscribers need know only\
    \ a single address\n             - Responsible parties get the error reports and\
    \ not\n               the subscribers\n       o Typically, each subscription address\
    \ is not a person's private\n       maildrop, but a system-wide maildrop, which\
    \ can be accessed\n       by more than one user.  This has several advantages:\n\
    \             - Only a single copy of each message need traverse the\n       \
    \        net for a given site (which may contain several local\n             \
    \  hosts).  This conserves bandwidth and cycles.\n             - Only a single\
    \ copy of each message need reside on each\n               subscribing host. \
    \ This conserves disk space.\n             - The private maildrop for each user\
    \ is not cluttered\n               with discussion group mail.\n   Despite this\
    \ optimization of resources, further economy can be\n   achieved at sites with\
    \ more than one host.  Typically, sites with\n   more than one host either:\n\
    \        1.  Replicate discussion group mail on each host.  This\n        results\
    \ in literally gigabytes of disk space committed to\n        unnecessarily store\
    \ redundant information.\n        2.  Keep discussion group mail on one host and\
    \ give all users a\n        login on that host (in addition to any other logins\
    \ they may\n        have).  This is usually a gross inconvenience for users who\n\
    \        work on other hosts, or a burden to users who are forced to\n       \
    \ work on that host.\n   As discussed in [RFC1081], the problem of giving workstations\
    \ dynamic\n   access to mail from a mailbox server has been explored in great\n\
    \   detail (originally there was [RFC918], this prompted the author to\n   write\
    \ [RFC1081], independently of this [RFC918] was upgraded to\n   [RFC937]).  A\
    \ natural solution to the problem outlined above is to\n   keep discussion group\
    \ mail on a mailbox server at each site and\n   permit different hosts at that\
    \ site to employ the POP3 to access\n   discussion group mail.  If implemented\
    \ properly, this avoids the\n   problems of both strategies outlined above.\n\
    \        ASIDE:     It might be noted that a good distributed filesystem\n   \
    \                could also solve this problem.  Sadly, \"good\"\n           \
    \        distributed filesystems, which do not suffer\n                   unacceptable\
    \ response time for interactive use, are\n                   few and far between\
    \ these days!\n   Given this motivation, now let's consider discussion groups,\
    \ both in\n   general and from the point of view of a user agent.  Following this,\n\
    \   extensions to the POP3 defined in [RFC1081] are presented.  Finally,\n   some\
    \ additional policy details are discussed along with some initial\n   experiences.\n"
- title: What's in a Discussion Group
  contents:
  - "What's in a Discussion Group\n   Since mailers and user agents first crawled\
    \ out of the primordial\n   ARPAnet, the value of discussion groups have been\
    \ appreciated,\n   (though their implementation has not always been well-understood).\n\
    \   Described simply, a discussion group is composed of a number of\n   subscribers\
    \ with a common interest.  These subscribers post mail to a\n   single address,\
    \ known as a distribution address.  From this\n   distribution address, a copy\
    \ of the message is sent to each\n   subscriber.  Each group has a moderator,\
    \ which is the person that\n   administrates the group.  The moderator can usually\
    \ be reached at a\n   special address, known as a request address.  Usually, the\n\
    \   responsibilities of the moderator are quite simple, since the mail\n   system\
    \ handles the distribution to subscribers automatically.  In\n   some cases, the\
    \ interest group, instead of being distributed directly\n   to its subscribers,\
    \ is put into a digest format by the moderator and\n   then sent to the subscribers.\
    \  Although this requires more work on\n   the part of the moderator, such groups\
    \ tend to be better organized.\n   Unfortunately, there are a few problems with\
    \ the scheme outlined\n   above.  First, if two users on the same host subscribe\
    \ to the same\n   interest group, two copies of the message get delivered.  This\
    \ is\n   wasteful of both processor and disk resources.\n   Second, some of these\
    \ groups carry a lot of traffic.  Although\n   subscription to an group does indicate\
    \ interest on the part of a\n   subscriber, it is usually not interesting to get\
    \ 50 messages or so\n   delivered to the user's private maildrop each day, interspersed\
    \ with\n   personal mail, that is likely to be of a much more important and\n\
    \   timely nature.\n   Third, if a subscriber on the distribution list for a group\
    \ becomes\n   \"bad\" somehow, the originator of the message and not the moderator\
    \ of\n   the group is notified.  It is not uncommon for a large list to have\n\
    \   10 or so bogus addresses present.  This results in the originator\n   being\
    \ flooded with \"error messages\" from mailers across the Internet\n   stating\
    \ that a given address on the list was bad.  Needless to say,\n   the originator\
    \ usually could not care less if the bogus addresses got\n   a copy of the message\
    \ or not.  The originator is merely interested in\n   posting a message to the\
    \ group at large.  Furthermore, the moderator\n   of the group does care if there\
    \ are bogus addresses on the list, but\n   ironically does not receive notification.\n\
    \   There are various approaches which can be used to solve some or all\n   of\
    \ these problems.  Usually these involve placing an exploder agent\n   at the\
    \ distribution source of the discussion group, which expands the\n   name of the\
    \ group into the list of subscription addresses for the\n   group.  In the process,\
    \ the exploder will also change the address\n   that receives error notifications\
    \ to be the request address or other\n   responsible party.\n   A complementary\
    \ approach, used in order to cut down on resource\n   utilization of all kinds,\
    \ replaces all the subscribers at a single\n   host (or group of hosts under a\
    \ single administration) with a single\n   address at that host.  This address\
    \ maps to a file on the host,\n   usually in a spool area, which all users can\
    \ access.  (Advanced\n   implementations can also implement private discussion\
    \ groups this\n   way, in which a single copy of each message is kept, but is\n\
    \   accessible to only a select number of users on the host.)\n   The two approaches\
    \ can be combined to avoid all of the problems\n   described above.\n   Finally,\
    \ a third approach can be taken, which can be used to aid user\n   agents processing\
    \ mail for the discussion group:  In order to speed\n   querying of the maildrop\
    \ which contains the local host's copy of the\n   discussion group, two other\
    \ items are usually associated with the\n   discussion group, on a local basis.\
    \  These are the maxima and the\n   last-date.  Each time a message is received\
    \ for the group on the\n   local host, the maxima is increased by at least one.\
    \  Furthermore,\n   when a new maxima is generated, the current date is determined.\
    \  This\n   is called the last date.  As the message is entered into the local\n\
    \   maildrop, it is given the current maxima and last-date.  This permits\n  \
    \ the user agent to quickly determine if new messages are present in\n   the maildrop.\n\
    \       NOTE:      The maxima may be characterized as a monotonically\n      \
    \            increasing quanity.  Although sucessive values of the\n         \
    \         maxima need not be consecutive, any maxima assigned\n              \
    \    is always greater than any previously assigned value.\n"

    \ maildrop, and older mail is kept\n   off-line.  With this scheme, in addition\
    \ to having a \"standard\"\n   maildrop for each discussion group, an \"archive\"\
    \ maildrop may also be\n   available.  This permits a user agent to examine the\
    \ most recent\n   archive using the same mechanisms as those used on the current\

- title: The XTND Command
  contents:
  - "The XTND Command\n   The following commands are valid only in the TRANSACTION\
    \ state of the\n   POP3.  This implies that the POP3 server has already opened\
    \ the\n   user's maildrop (which may be empty).  This maildrop is called the\n\
    \   \"default maildrop\".  The phrase \"closes the current maildrop\" has two\n\
    \   meanings, depending on whether the current maildrop is the default\n   maildrop\
    \ or is a maildrop associated with a discussion group.\n   In the former context,\
    \ when the current maildrop is closed any\n   messages marked as deleted are removed\
    \ from the maildrop currently in\n   use.  The exclusive-access lock on the maildrop\
    \ is then released\n   along with any implementation-specific resources (e.g.,\
    \ file-\n   descriptors).\n   In the latter context, a maildrop associated with\
    \ a discussion group\n   is considered to be read-only to the POP3 client.  In\
    \ this case, the\n   phrase \"closes the current maildrop\" merely means that\
    \ any\n   implementation-specific resources are released.  (Hence, the POP3\n\
    \   command DELE is a no-op.)\n   All the new facilities are introduced via a\
    \ single POP3 command,\n   XTND.  All positive reponses to the XTND command are\
    \ multi-line.\n   The most common multi-line response to the commands contains\
    \ a\n   \"discussion group listing\" which presents the name of the discussion\n\
    \   group along with it's maxima.  In order to simplify parsing all POP3\n   servers\
    \ are required to use a certain format for discussion group\n   listings:\n  \

    \ agents, this memo requires an extension to the\n   scan listing when an \"XTND\

    \ by the LIST, takes the form:\n          MSGNO SIZE\n   where MSGNO is the number\

  - "Policy Notes\n   Depending on the particular entity administrating the POP3 service\n\
    \   host, two additional policies might be implemented:\n   1.  Private Discussion\
    \ Groups\n   In the general case, discussion groups are world-readable, any user,\n\
    \   once logged in (via a terminal, terminal server, or POP3, etc.), is\n   able\
    \ to read the maildrop for each discussion group known to the POP3\n   service\
    \ host.  Nevertheless, it is desirable, usually for privacy\n   reasons, to implement\
    \ private discussion groups as well.\n   Support of this is consistent with the\
    \ extensions outlined in this\n   memo.  Once the AUTHORIZATION state has successfully\
    \ concluded, the\n   POP3 server grants the user access to exactly those discussion\
    \ groups\n   the POP3 service host permits the authenticated user to access. \
    \ As a\n   \"security\" feature, discussion groups associated with unreadable\n\
    \   maildrops should not be listed in a positive response to the XTND\n   BBOARDS\
    \ command.\n   2.  Anonymous POP3 Users\n   In order to minimize the authentication\
    \ problem, a policy permitting\n   \"anonymous\" access to the world-readable\
    \ maildrops for discussion\n   groups on the POP3 server may be implemented.\n\
    \   Support of this is consistent with the extensions outlined in this\n   memo.\
    \  The POP3 server can be modified to accept a USER command for a\n   well-known\
    \ pseudonym (i.e., \"anonymous\") which is valid with any PASS\n   command.  As\
    \ a \"security\" feature, it is advisable to limit this kind\n   of access to\
    \ only hosts at the local site, or to hosts named in an\n   access list.\n"
- title: Experiences and Conclusions
  contents:
  - "Experiences and Conclusions\n   All of the facilities described in this memo\
    \ and in [RFC1081] have\n   been implemented in MH #6.1.  Initial experiences\
    \ have been, on the\n   whole, very positive.\n   After the first implementation,\
    \ some performance tuning was required.\n   This consisted primarily of caching\
    \ the datastructures which describe\n   discussion groups in the POP3 server.\
    \  A second optimization\n   pertained to the client:  the program most commonly\
    \ used to read\n   BBoards in MH was modified to retrieve messages only when needed.\n\
    \   Two schemes are used:\n         o If only the headers (and the first few lines\
    \ of the body) of\n           the message are required (e.g., for a scan listing),\
    \ then only\n           these are retrieved.  The resulting output is then cached,\
    \ on\n           a per-message basis.\n         o If the entire message is required,\
    \ then it is retrieved intact,\n            and cached locally.\n   With these\
    \ optimizations, response time is quite adequate when the\n   POP3 server and\
    \ client are connected via a high-speed local area\n   network.  In fact, the\
    \ author uses this mechanism to access certain\n   private discussion groups over\
    \ the Internet.  In this case, response\n   is still good.  When a 9.6Kbps modem\
    \ is inserted in the path,\n   response went from good to almost tolerable (fortunately\
    \ the author\n   only reads a few discussion groups in this fashion).\n   To conclude:\
    \ the POP3 is a good thing, not only for personal mail but\n   for discussion\
    \ group mail as well.\n"
