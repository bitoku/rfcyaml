Abstract This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB) for use with network management protocols in the Internet community
In particular, it describes managed objects used for managing the Border Gateway Protocol Version 4 or lower.
The origin of this memo is from RFC 1269 "Definitions of Managed Objects for the Border Gateway Protocol (Version 3)", which was updated to support BGP 4 in RFC 1657.
This memo fixes errors introduced when the MIB module was converted to use the SMIv2 language.
This memo also updates references to the current SNMP framework documents.
This memo is intended to document deployed implementations of this MIB module in a historical context, to provide clarifications of some items, and to note errors where the MIB module fails to fully represent the BGP protocol.
Work is currently in progress to replace this MIB module with a new one representing the current state of the BGP protocol and its extensions.
This document obsoletes RFC 1269 and RFC 1657.
This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB) for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
In particular, it describes managed objects used for managing the Border Gateway Protocol Version 4 or lower [BGP4, BGP4APP].
This memo obsoletes RFC 1657 and RFC 1269.
The Internet Standard Management Framework
For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current Internet Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of RFC 3410 [RFC3410].
Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed the Management Information Base or MIB.
MIB objects are generally accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the Structure of Management Information (SMI).
This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58, RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58
, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
These objects are used to control and manage a BGP 4 implementation.
Apart from a few system wide scalar objects, this MIB is broken into three tables:
the BGP Peer Table, the BGP Received Path Attribute Table, and the BGP 4 Received Path Attribute Table.
The BGP Peer Table contains information about state and current activity of connections with the BGP peers.
The BGP Received Path Attribute Table
contains path attributes received from all peers running BGP version 3 or less.
The BGP 4 Received Path Attribute Table contains path attributes received from all BGP 4 peers.
The actual attributes used in determining a route are a subset of the received attribute tables after local routing policy has been applied.

REVISION "200601110000Z" DESCRIPTION "Changes from RFC 1657: 1) Fixed the definitions of the notifications to make them equivalent to their initial definition in RFC 1269.
2) Added compliance and conformance info.
3) Updated information for the values of bgpPeerNegotiatedVersion, bgp4PathAttrLocalPref, bgp4PathAttrCalcLocalPref, bgp4PathAttrMultiExitDisc, bgp4PathAttrASPathSegement. 4
) Added additional clarification comments where needed.
Noted where objects do not fully reflect the protocol as Known Issues.
6) Updated the DESCRIPTION for the bgp4PathAttrAtomicAggregate object.
The following objects have had their DESCRIPTION clause modified to remove the text that suggested (using 'should' verb) initializing the counter to zero on a transition to the established state: bgpPeerInUpdates,
Those implementations that still do this are still compliant with this new wording.
Applications should not assume counters have started at zero.

REVISION "199110261839Z" DESCRIPTION "Initial version, published as RFC 1269."
Each peer negotiates the version from this vector.
Versions are identified via the string of bits contained within this object.
The first octet contains bits 0 to 7, the second octet contains bits 8 to 15, and so on, with the most significant bit referring to the lowest bit number in the octet (e.g., the MSB of the first octet refers to bit 0).
If a bit, i, is present and set, then the version (i 1) of the BGP is supported.

This MIB relates to a system providing inter domain routing.
As such, improper manipulation of the objects represented by this MIB may result in denial of service to a large number of end users.
There are several management objects defined in this MIB that have a MAX ACCESS clause of read write and/or read create.
Such objects should be considered sensitive or vulnerable in most network environments.
The support for SET operations in a non secure environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on network operations.
These objects include: bgpPeerAdminStatus Improper change of bgpPeerAdminStatus, from start to stop, can cause significant disruption of the connectivity to those portions of the Internet reached via the applicable remote BGP peer.
bgpPeerConnectRetryInterval Improper change of this object can cause connections to be disrupted for extremely long time periods when otherwise they would be restored in a relatively short period of time.
bgpPeerHoldTimeConfigured, bgpPeerKeepAliveConfigured Misconfiguration of these objects can make BGP sessions more fragile and less resilient to denial of service attacks on the inter domain routing system.
bgpPeerMinRouteAdvertisementInterval Misconfiguration of these objects may adversely affect global Internet convergence of the routes advertised by this BGP speaker.
This may result in long lived routing loops and blackholes for the portions of the Internet that utilize these routes.
There are a number of managed objects in this MIB that contain sensitive information regarding the operation of a network.
For example, a BGP peer's local and remote addresses might be sensitive for ISPs who want to keep interface addresses on routers confidential in order to prevent router addresses used for a denial of service attack or spoofing.
Therefore, it is important in most environments to control read access to these objects and possibly to even encrypt the values of these object when sending them over the network via SNMP.
SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPsec), even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is allowed to access and
the objects in this MIB module.
It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8), including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for authentication and privacy).
Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT RECOMMENDED.
Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to enable cryptographic security.
It is then a customer/operator responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate rights to indeed GET or SET
