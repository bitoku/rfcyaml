Abstract This document defines a Management Information Base (MIB) module for use with network management protocols in TCP/IP based internets.
This document proposes an extension to the GBOND MIB module with a set of objects for managing ATM based multi pair bonded xDSL interfaces, as defined in ITU T Recommendation G.998.1.
Based Multi Pair Bonding, a.k.a. G.Bond/ATM, is specified in ITU T Recommendation G.998.1 [G.998.1], which defines a method for bonding (or aggregating)
multiple xDSL lines (or individual bearer channels in multiple xDSL lines) into a single bidirectional logical link carrying an ATM stream.
This specification can be viewed as an evolution of the legacy Inverse Multiplexing for ATM (IMA) technology [AF PHY 0086], applied to xDSL with variable rates on each line/bearer channel.
As with the other bonding schemes, ATM bonding also allows bonding of up to 32 individual sub layers with variable rates, providing common functionality for the configuration, initialization, operation, and monitoring of the bonded link.
The MIB module defined in this document defines a set of managed objects for the management of G.998.1 bonded interfaces, extending the common objects specified in the GBOND MIB module [RFC6765].
The Internet Standard Management Framework
For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current Internet Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of RFC 3410 [RFC3410].
Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed the Management Information Base or MIB.
MIB objects are generally accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the Structure of Management Information (SMI).
This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58, RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58
, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, RFC 2119 [RFC2119].
The Broadband Forum Management Framework for xDSL Bonding
This document makes use of the Broadband Forum technical report "Management Framework for xDSL Bonding" [TR 159], defining a management model and a hierarchy of management objects for the bonded xDSL interfaces.
Relationship to Other MIB Modules
This section outlines the relationship of the MIB modules defined in this document with other MIB modules described in the relevant RFCs.
Specifically, the following MIB modules are discussed: the Interfaces Group MIB (IF MIB) and the G.Bond MIB (GBOND MIB).
Relationship to Interfaces Group MIB Module A G.Bond/ATM port is a private case of a bonded multi pair xDSL interface and as such is managed using generic interface management objects defined in the IF MIB
In particular, an interface index (ifIndex) is used to index instances of G.Bond/ATM ports, as well as xDSL lines/channels, in a managed system.
Relationship to G.Bond MIB Module
The GBOND MIB module [RFC6765] defines management objects common for all bonded multi pair xDSL interfaces.
In particular, it describes the bonding management, bonded port and channel configuration, initialization sequence, etc.
Both the GBOND MIB and G9981 MIB modules are REQUIRED to manage a G.Bond/ATM port.
Relationship to ATM MIB Module
The ATM MIB [RFC2515] module defines management objects for an ATM interface.
The ATM MIB module can be used to manage the ATM aspects of a G.Bond/ ATM port.
All management objects defined in the G9981 MIB module are contained in a single group g9981Port.
This group is further split into 4 sub groups, structured as recommended by RFC 4181
[RFC4181]:  g9981PortNotifications containing notifications (Up/Downstream Differential Delay Tolerance Exceeded).
g9981PortConfTable containing objects for configuration of a G.Bond/ATM port.
g9981PortStatusTable containing objects providing overall status information of a G.Bond/ATM port, complementing the generic status information from the ifTable of the IF MIB and the gBondFltStatus of the GBOND MIB.
g9981PM containing objects providing historical Performance Monitoring (PM) information of a G.Bond/ATM port, complementing the PM information from the gBondPortPM of the GBOND MIB.
Note that the rest of the objects for the Generic Bonding Sub layer (GBS) port configuration, capabilities, status, notifications, and Performance Monitoring are located in the GBOND MIB module.
The OPTIONAL Performance Monitoring counters, thresholds, and history buckets (interval counters) are implemented using the textual conventions defined in the HC PerfHist TC MIB [RFC3705].
PerfHist TC MIB defines 64 bit versions of the textual conventions found in the PerfHist TC MIB [RFC3593].
The agent SHOULD align the beginning of each interval to a fifteen  minute boundary of a wall clock.
Likewise, the beginning of each one day interval SHOULD be aligned with the start of a day.
Counters are not reset when a GBS is re initialized, but rather only when the agent is reset or re initialized.
Note that the accumulation of certain performance events for a monitored entity is inhibited (counting stops) during periods of service unavailability on that entity.
The DESCRIPTION clause of Performance Monitoring counters in this MIB module specifies which of the counters are inhibited during periods of service unavailability.
Mapping of Broadband Forum TR 159 Managed Objects
This section contains the mapping between relevant managed objects (attributes) defined in [TR 159] and the managed objects defined in this document.
Mapping of TR 159 Managed Objects Note that some of the mapping between the objects defined in TR 159 and the ones defined in this MIB module is not one to one; for example, while TR 159 PM attributes aGroupPerf  map to the corresponding gBondPortPm  objects of the GBOND MIB module, there are no dedicated PM attributes for the g9981PortPm  objects introduced in this MIB module.
However, since their definition is identical to the definition of gBondPortPm  objects of the GBOND MIB module, we can map g9981PortPm  to the relevant aGroupPerf  attributes of TR 159 and use the term 'partial mapping' to denote the fact that this mapping is not one to one.
The G9981 MIB module IMPORTS objects from SNMPv2
CONF [RFC2580], IF MIB [RFC2863], and HC PerfHist TC MIB [
The module has been structured as recommended by [RFC4181].

"The compliance statement for G.Bond/ATM interfaces.
Compliance with the following external compliance statements is REQUIRED:
There are a number of managed objects defined in this MIB module with a MAX ACCESS clause of read write.
Such objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.
The support for SET operations in a non secure environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on network operations.
These are the tables and objects and their sensitivity/vulnerability:  Changing of g9981PortConfTable configuration parameters
MAY lead to a potential Service Level Agreement (SLA) breach, for example, if a traffic delay is increased as a result of the higher delay tolerance (increased g9981PortConfUpDiffDelayTolerance and/or g9981PortConfDnDiffDelayTolerance), or the differential delay tolerance notifications are disabled by manipulating the g9981PortConfDiffDelayToleranceExceededEnable parameter.
Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a MAX ACCESS other than not accessible) may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments since, collectively, they provide information about the performance of network interfaces and can reveal some aspects of their configuration.
It is thus important to control even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over the network via SNMP.
SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPsec), there is no control as to who on the secure network is allowed to access and
the objects in this MIB module.
Implementations SHOULD provide the security features described by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410]), and implementations claiming compliance to the SNMPv3 standard MUST include full support for authentication and privacy via the User based Security Model (USM)
[RFC3414] with the AES cipher algorithm [RFC3826].
Implementations MAY also provide support for the Transport Security Model (TSM)
[RFC5591] in combination with a secure transport such as SSH [RFC5592] or TLS/DTLS [RFC6353].
Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT RECOMMENDED.
Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to enable cryptographic security.
It is then a customer/operator responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate rights to indeed GET or SET
