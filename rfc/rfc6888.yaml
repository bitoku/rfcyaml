  - "1.  Introduction\n   With the shortage of IPv4 addresses, it is expected that\
    \ more\n   Internet Service Providers (ISPs) may want to provide a service where\n\
    \   a public IPv4 address would be shared by many subscribers.  Each\n   subscriber\
    \ is assigned a private address, and a Network Address\n   Translator (NAT) [RFC2663]\
    \ situated in the ISP's network translates\n   the traffic between private and\
    \ public addresses.  When a second IPv4\n   NAT is located at the customer edge,\
    \ this results in two layers of\n   NAT.\n   This service can conceivably be offered\
    \ alongside others, such as\n   IPv6 services or regular IPv4 service assigning\
    \ public addresses to\n   subscribers.  Some ISPs started offering such a service\
    \ long before\n   there was a shortage of IPv4 addresses, showing that there are\n\
    \   driving forces other than the shortage of IPv4 addresses.  One\n   approach\
    \ to CGN deployment is described in [RFC6264].\n   This document describes behavior\
    \ that is required of those multi-\n   subscriber NATs for interoperability. \
    \ It is not an IETF endorsement\n   of CGNs or a real specification for CGNs;\
    \ rather, it is just a\n   minimal set of requirements that will increase the\
    \ likelihood of\n   applications working across CGNs.\n   Because subscribers\
    \ do not receive unique IPv4 addresses, Carrier-\n   Grade NATs introduce substantial\
    \ limitations in communications\n   between subscribers and with the rest of the\
    \ Internet.  In\n   particular, it is considerably more involved to establish\
    \ proxy\n   functionality at the border between internal and external realms.\n\
    \   Some applications may require substantial enhancements, while some\n   others\
    \ may not function at all in such an environment.  Please see\n   \"Issues with\
    \ IP Address Sharing\" [RFC6269] for details.\n   This document builds upon previous\
    \ works describing requirements for\n   generic NATs [RFC4787][RFC5382][RFC5508].\
    \  These documents, and their\n   updates if any, still apply in this context.\
    \  What follows are\n   additional requirements, to be satisfied on top of previous\
    \ ones.\n"
- title: 2.  Terminology
  contents:
  - "2.  Terminology\n   The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\"\
    , \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and\
    \ \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].\n\
    \   Readers are expected to be familiar with \"Network Address Translation\n \
    \  (NAT) Behavioral Requirements for Unicast UDP\" [RFC4787] and the\n   terms\
    \ defined there.  The following additional term is used in this\n   document:\n\
    \   Carrier-Grade NAT (CGN):  A NAT-based [RFC2663] logical function used\n  \
    \    to share the same IPv4 address among several subscribers.  A CGN\n      is\
    \ not managed by the subscribers.\n         Note that the term \"carrier-grade\"\
    \ has nothing to do with the\n         quality of the NAT; that is left to discretion\
    \ of implementers.\n         Rather, it is to be understood as a topological qualifier:\
    \ the\n         NAT is placed in an ISP's network and translates the traffic of\n\
    \         potentially many subscribers.  Subscribers have limited or no\n    \
    \     control over the CGN, whereas they typically have full control\n       \
    \  over a NAT placed on their premises.\n         Note also that the CGN described\
    \ in this document is IPv4-only.\n         IPv6 address translation is not considered.\n\
    \         However, the scenario in which the IPv4-only CGN logical\n         function\
    \ is used may include IPv6 elements.  For example, Dual-\n         Stack Lite\
    \ (DS-Lite) [RFC6333] uses an IPv4-only CGN logical\n         function in a scenario\
    \ making use of IPv6 encapsulation.\n         Therefore, this document would also\
    \ apply to the CGN part of\n         DS-Lite.\n   Figure 1 summarizes a common\
    \ network topology in which a CGN\n   operates.\n                            \

    \ Topology\n   Another possible topology is one for hotspots, where there is no\n\
    \   customer premise or customer premises equipment (CPE), but where a\n   CGN\
    \ serves a bunch of customers who don't trust each other; hence,\n   fairness\
    \ is an issue.  One important difference with the previous\n   topology is the\
    \ absence of a second layer of NAT.  This, however, has\n   no impact on CGN requirements\
    \ since they are driven by fairness and\n   robustness in the service provided\
    \ to customers, which applies in\n   both cases.\n"
- title: 3.  Requirements for CGNs
  contents:
  - "3.  Requirements for CGNs\n   What follows is a list of requirements for CGNs.\
    \  They are in\n   addition to those found in other documents such as [RFC4787],\n\
    \   [RFC5382], and [RFC5508].\n   REQ-1:  If a CGN forwards packets containing\
    \ a given transport\n      protocol, then it MUST fulfill that transport protocol's\n\
    \      behavioral requirements.  Current applicable documents are as\n      follows:\n\
    \      a.  \"NAT Behavioral Requirements for Unicast UDP\" [RFC4787]\n      b.\
    \  \"Network Address Translation (NAT) Behavioral Requirements for\n         \
    \ TCP\" [RFC5382]\n      c.  \"NAT Behavioral Requirements for ICMP\" [RFC5508]\n\
    \      d.  \"Network Address Translation (NAT) Behavioral Requirements for\n \
    \         the Datagram Congestion Control Protocol (DCCP)\" [RFC5597]\n      Any\
    \ future NAT behavioral requirements documents for IPv4\n      transport protocols\
    \ will impose additional requirements for CGNs\n      on top of those stated here.\n\
    \   Justification:  It is crucial for CGNs to maximize the set of\n      applications\
    \ that can function properly across them.  The IETF has\n      documented the\
    \ best current practices for UDP, TCP, ICMP, and\n      DCCP.\n   REQ-2:  A CGN\
    \ MUST have a default \"IP address pooling\" behavior of\n      \"Paired\" (as\
    \ defined in Section 4.1 of [RFC4787]).  A CGN MAY\n      provide a mechanism\
    \ for administrators to change this behavior on\n      an application protocol\
    \ basis.\n      *  When multiple overlapping internal IP address ranges share\
    \ the\n         same external IP address pool (e.g., DS-Lite [RFC6333]), the\n\
    \         \"IP address pooling\" behavior applies to mappings between\n      \
    \   external IP addresses and internal subscribers rather than\n         between\
    \ external and internal IP addresses.\n   Justification:  This stronger form of\
    \ REQ-2 from [RFC4787] is\n      justified by the stronger need for not breaking\
    \ applications that\n      depend on the external address remaining constant.\n\
    \      Note that this requirement applies regardless of the transport\n      protocol.\
    \  In other words, a CGN must use the same external IP\n      address mapping\
    \ for all sessions associated with the same internal\n      IP address, be they\
    \ TCP, UDP, ICMP, something else, or a mix of\n      different protocols.\n  \
    \    The justification for allowing other behaviors is to allow the\n      administrator\
    \ to save external addresses and ports for application\n      protocols that are\
    \ known to work fine with other behaviors in\n      practice.  However, the default\
    \ behavior MUST be \"Paired\".\n   REQ-3:  The CGN function SHOULD NOT have any\
    \ limitations on the size\n      or the contiguity of the external address pool.\
    \  In particular,\n      the CGN function MUST be configurable with contiguous\
    \ or non-\n      contiguous external IPv4 address ranges.\n   Justification: \
    \ Given the increasing rarity of IPv4 addresses, it is\n      becoming harder\
    \ for an operator to provide large contiguous\n      address pools to CGNs.  Additionally,\
    \ operational flexibility may\n      require non-contiguous address pools for\
    \ reasons such as\n      differentiated services, routing management, etc.\n \
    \     The reason for having SHOULD instead of MUST is to account for\n      limitations\
    \ imposed by available resources as well as constraints\n      imposed for security\
    \ reasons.\n   REQ-4:  A CGN MUST support limiting the number of external ports\
    \ (or,\n      equivalently, \"identifiers\" for ICMP) that are assigned per\n\
    \      subscriber.\n      a.  Per-subscriber limits MUST be configurable by the\
    \ CGN\n          administrator.\n      b.  Per-subscriber limits MAY be configurable\
    \ independently per\n          transport protocol.\n      c.  Additionally, it\
    \ is RECOMMENDED that the CGN include\n          administrator-adjustable thresholds\
    \ to prevent a single\n          subscriber from consuming excessive CPU resources\
    \ from the CGN\n          (e.g., rate-limit the subscriber's creation of new mappings).\n\
    \   Justification:  A CGN can be considered a network resource that is\n     \
    \ shared by competing subscribers.  Limiting the number of external\n      ports\
    \ assigned to each subscriber mitigates the denial-of-service\n      (DoS) attack\
    \ that a subscriber could launch against other\n      subscribers through the\
    \ CGN in order to get a larger share of the\n      resource.  It ensures fairness\
    \ among subscribers.  Limiting the\n      rate of allocation mitigates a similar\
    \ attack where the CPU is the\n      resource being targeted instead of port numbers.\
    \  However, this\n      requirement is not a MUST because it is very hard to explicitly\n\
    \      call out all CPU-consuming events.\n   REQ-5:  A CGN SHOULD support limiting\
    \ the amount of state memory\n      allocated per mapping and per subscriber.\
    \  This may include\n      limiting the number of sessions, the number of filters,\
    \ etc.,\n      depending on the NAT implementation.\n      a.  Limits SHOULD be\
    \ configurable by the CGN administrator.\n      b.  Additionally, it SHOULD be\
    \ possible to limit the rate at which\n          memory-consuming state elements\
    \ are allocated.\n   Justification:  A NAT needs to keep track of TCP sessions\
    \ associated\n      with each mapping.  This state consumes resources for which,\
    \ in\n      the case of a CGN, subscribers may compete.  It is necessary to\n\
    \      ensure that each subscriber has access to a fair share of the\n      CGN's\
    \ resources.  Limiting the rate of allocation is intended to\n      prevent CPU\
    \ resource exhaustion.  Item \"B\" is at the SHOULD level\n      to account for\
    \ the fact that means other than rate limiting may be\n      used to attain the\
    \ same goal.\n   REQ-6:  It MUST be possible to administratively turn off translation\n\
    \      for specific destination addresses and/or ports.\n   Justification:  It\
    \ is common for a CGN administrator to provide\n      access for subscribers to\
    \ servers installed in the ISP's network\n      in the external realm.  When such\
    \ a server is able to reach the\n      internal realm via normal routing (which\
    \ is entirely controlled by\n      the ISP), translation is unneeded.  In that\
    \ case, the CGN may\n      forward packets without modification, thus acting like\
    \ a plain\n      router.  This may represent an important efficiency gain.\n \
    \     Figure 2 illustrates this use-case.\n                  X1:x1           \

    \    Figure 2: CGN Pass-Through\n   REQ-7:  It is RECOMMENDED that a CGN use an\
    \ \"endpoint-independent\n      filtering\" behavior (as defined in Section 5\
    \ of [RFC4787]).  If it\n      is known that \"Address-Dependent Filtering\" does\
    \ not cause the\n      application-layer protocol to break (how to determine this\
    \ is out\n      of scope for this document), then it MAY be used instead.\n  \
    \ Justification:  This is a stronger form of REQ-8 from [RFC4787].\n      This\
    \ is based on the observation that some games and peer-to-peer\n      applications\
    \ require EIF for the NAT traversal to work.  In the\n      context of a CGN,\
    \ it is important to minimize application\n      breakage.\n   REQ-8:  Once an\
    \ external port is deallocated, it SHOULD NOT be\n      reallocated to a new mapping\
    \ until at least 120 seconds have\n      passed, with the exceptions being:\n\
    \      a.  If the CGN tracks TCP sessions (e.g., with a state machine, as\n  \
    \        in Section 3.5.2.2 of [RFC6146]), TCP ports MAY be reused\n         \
    \ immediately.\n      b.  If external ports are statically assigned to internal\n\
    \          addresses (e.g., address X with port range 1000-1999 is\n         \
    \ assigned to subscriber A, 2000-2999 to subscriber B, etc.),\n          and the\
    \ assignment remains constant across state loss, then\n          ports MAY be\
    \ reused immediately.\n      c.  If the allocated external ports used address-dependent\
    \ or\n          address-and-port-dependent filtering before state loss, they\n\
    \          MAY be reused immediately.\n      The length of time and the maximum\
    \ number of ports in this state\n      MUST be configurable by the CGN administrator.\n\
    \   Justification:  This is necessary in order to prevent collisions\n      between\
    \ old and new mappings and sessions.  It ensures that all\n      established sessions\
    \ are broken instead of redirected to a\n      different peer.\n      The exceptions\
    \ are for cases where reusing a port immediately does\n      not create a possibility\
    \ that packets would be redirected to the\n      wrong peer.  One can imagine\
    \ other exceptions where mapping\n      collisions are avoided, thus justifying\
    \ the SHOULD level for this\n      requirement.\n      The 120 seconds value corresponds\
    \ to the Maximum Segment Lifetime\n      (MSL) from [RFC0793].\n      Note that\
    \ this requirement also applies to the case when a CGN\n      loses state (due\
    \ to a crash, reboot, failover to a cold standby,\n      etc.).  In that case,\
    \ ports that were in use at the time of state\n      loss SHOULD NOT be reallocated\
    \ until at least 120 seconds have\n      passed.\n   REQ-9:  A CGN MUST implement\
    \ a protocol giving subscribers explicit\n      control over NAT mappings.  That\
    \ protocol SHOULD be the Port\n      Control Protocol [RFC6887].\n   Justification:\
    \  Allowing subscribers to manipulate the NAT state\n      table with PCP greatly\
    \ increases the likelihood that applications\n      will function properly.\n\
    \      A study of PCP-less CGN impacts can be found in [NAT444].  Another\n  \
    \    study considering the effects of PCP on a peer-to-peer file\n      sharing\
    \ protocol can be found in [BITTORRENT].\n   REQ-10: CGN implementers SHOULD make\
    \ their equipment manageable.\n      Standards-based management using standards\
    \ such as \"Definitions of\n      Managed Objects for NAT\" [RFC4008] is RECOMMENDED.\n\
    \   Justification:  It is anticipated that CGNs will be primarily\n      deployed\
    \ in ISP networks where the need for management is\n      critical.  This requirement\
    \ is at the SHOULD level to account for\n      the fact that some CGN operators\
    \ may not need management\n      functionality.\n      Note also that there are\
    \ efforts within the IETF toward creating a\n      MIB tailored for CGNs (e.g.,\
    \ [NAT-MIB]).\n   REQ-11: When a CGN is unable to create a dynamic mapping due\
    \ to\n      resource constraints or administrative restrictions (i.e.,\n     \
    \ quotas):\n      a.  it MUST drop the original packet;\n      b.  it SHOULD send\
    \ an ICMP Destination Unreachable message with\n          code 1 (Host Unreachable)\
    \ to the sender;\n      c.  it SHOULD send a notification (e.g., SNMP trap) towards\
    \ a\n          management system (if configured to do so); and\n      d.  it MUST\
    \ NOT delete existing mappings in order to \"make room\"\n          for the new\
    \ one.  (This only applies to normal CGN behavior,\n          not to manual operator\
    \ intervention.)\n   Justification:  This is a slightly different form of REQ-8\
    \ from\n      [RFC5508].  Code 1 is preferred to code 13 because it is listed\
    \ as\n      a \"soft error\" in [RFC1122], which is important because we don't\n\
    \      want TCP stacks to abort the connection attempt in this case.  See\n  \
    \    [RFC5461] for details on TCP's reaction to soft errors.\n      Sending ICMP\
    \ errors and SNMP traps may be rate-limited for\n      security reasons, which\
    \ is why requirements B and C are SHOULDs,\n      not MUSTs.\n      Applications\
    \ generally handle connection establishment failure\n      better than established\
    \ connection failure.  This is why dropping\n      the packet initiating the new\
    \ connection is preferred over\n      deleting existing mappings.  See also the\
    \ rationale in Section 6\n      of [RFC5508].\n"
- title: 4.  Logging
  contents:
  - "4.  Logging\n   It may be necessary for CGN administrators to be able to identify\
    \ a\n   subscriber based on external IPv4 address, port, and timestamp in\n  \
    \ order to deal with abuse.  When multiple subscribers share a single\n   external\
    \ address, the source address and port that are visible at the\n   destination\
    \ host have been translated from the ones originated by the\n   subscriber.\n\
    \   In order to be able to do this, the CGN would need to log the\n   following\
    \ information for each mapping created (this list is for\n   informational purposes\
    \ only and does not constitute a requirement):\n   o  transport protocol\n   o\
    \  subscriber identifier (e.g., internal source address or tunnel\n      endpoint\
    \ identifier)\n   o  external source address\n   o  external source port\n   o\
    \  timestamp\n   By \"subscriber identifier\" we mean information that uniquely\n\
    \   identifies a subscriber.  For example, in a traditional NAT scenario,\n  \
    \ the internal source address would be sufficient.  In the case of DS-\n   Lite,\
    \ many subscribers share the same internal address and the\n   subscriber identifier\
    \ is the tunnel endpoint identifier (i.e., the\n   B4's IPv6 address).\n   A disadvantage\
    \ of logging mappings is that CGNs under heavy usage may\n   produce large amounts\
    \ of logs, which may require large storage\n   volume.\n   REQ-12: A CGN SHOULD\
    \ NOT log destination addresses or ports unless\n      required to do so for administrative\
    \ reasons.\n   Justification:  Destination logging at the CGN creates privacy\n\
    \      issues.  Furthermore, readers should be aware of logging\n      recommendations\
    \ for Internet-facing servers [RFC6302].  With\n      compliant servers, the destination\
    \ address and port do not need to\n      be logged by the CGN.  This can help\
    \ reduce the amount of logging.\n      This requirement is at the SHOULD level\
    \ to account for the fact\n      that there may be other reasons for logging destination\
    \ addresses\n      or ports.  One such reason might be that the remote server\
    \ is not\n      following [RFC6302].\n"
- title: 5.  Port Allocation Scheme
  contents:
  - "5.  Port Allocation Scheme\n   A CGN's port allocation scheme is subject to three\
    \ competing\n   requirements:\n   REQ-13: A CGN's port allocation scheme SHOULD\
    \ maximize port\n      utilization.\n   Justification:  External ports are one\
    \ of the resources being shared\n      by a CGN.  Efficient management of that\
    \ resource directly impacts\n      the quality of a subscriber's Internet connection.\n\
    \      Some schemes are very efficient in their port utilization.  In\n      that\
    \ sense, they have good scaling properties (nothing is wasted).\n      Others\
    \ will systematically waste ports.\n   REQ-14: A CGN's port allocation scheme\
    \ SHOULD minimize log volume.\n   Justification:  Huge log volumes can be problematic\
    \ to CGN operators.\n      Some schemes create one log entry per mapping.  Others\
    \ allow\n      multiple mappings to generate a single log entry, which sometimes\n\
    \      can be expressed very compactly.  With some schemes, the logging\n    \
    \  frequency can approach that of DHCP servers.\n   REQ-15: A CGN's port allocation\
    \ scheme SHOULD make it hard for\n      attackers to guess port numbers.\n   Justification:\
    \  Easily guessed port numbers put subscribers at risk\n      of the attacks described\
    \ in [RFC6056].\n      Some schemes provide very good security in that ports numbers\
    \ are\n      not easily guessed.  Others provide poor security to subscribers.\n\
    \   A CGN implementation's choice of port allocation scheme optimizes to\n   satisfy\
    \ one requirement at the expense of another.  Therefore, these\n   are soft requirements\
    \ (SHOULD as opposed to MUST).\n"
- title: 6.  Deployment Considerations
  contents:
  - "6.  Deployment Considerations\n   Several issues are encountered when CGNs are\
    \ used [RFC6269].  There\n   is current work in the IETF toward alleviating some\
    \ of these issues.\n   For example, see [NAT-REVEAL].\n"
- title: 7.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "7.  Security Considerations\n   If a malicious subscriber can spoof another subscriber's\
    \ CPE, it may\n   cause a DoS to that subscriber by creating mappings up to the\
    \ allowed\n   limit.  An ISP can prevent this with ingress filtering, as described\n\
    \   in [RFC2827].\n   This document recommends endpoint-independent filtering\
    \ (EIF) as the\n   default filtering behavior for CGNs.  EIF has security considerations\n\
    \   that are discussed in [RFC4787].\n   NATs sometimes perform fragment reassembly.\
    \  CGNs would do so at\n   presumably high data rates.  Therefore, the reader\
    \ should be familiar\n   with the potential security issues described in [RFC4963].\n"
