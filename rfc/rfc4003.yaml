  title: Abstract
- contents:
  - "1.  Background\n   The ability to control the label used on the output/downstream\n
    \  interface of an egress node was one of the early requirements for\n   GMPLS.
    \ In the initial GMPLS documents, this was called \"Egress\n   Control\".  As
    the GMPLS documents progressed, the ability to control\n   a label on an egress
    interface was generalized to support control of\n   a label on any interface.
    \ This generalization is seen in Section 6\n   of [RFC3471] and Section 5.1 of
    [RFC3473].  When this functionality\n   was generalized, the procedures to support
    control of a label at the\n   egress were also generalized.  Although the result
    was intended to\n   cover egress control, this intention is not clear to all.
    \ This note\n   reiterates the procedures to cover control of a label used on
    an\n   egress output/downstream interface.\n   For context, the following is the
    text from the GMPLS signalling\n   document dated June 2000 about how ERO (Explicit
    Route Object) for\n   egress control:\n      6. Egress Control\n      The LSR
    at the head-end of an LSP can control the termination of\n      the LSP by using
    the ERO.  To terminate an LSP on a particular\n      outgoing interface of the
    egress LSR, the head-end may specify the\n      IP address of that interface as
    the last element in the ERO,\n      provided that interface has an associated
    IP address.\n      There are cases where the use of IP address doesn't provide
    enough\n      information to uniquely identify the egress termination.  One case\n
    \     is when the outgoing interface on the egress LSR is a component\n      link
    of a link bundle.  Another case is when it is desirable to\n      \"splice\" two
    LSPs together, i.e., where the tail of the first LSP\n      would be \"spliced\"
    into the head of the second LSP.  This last\n      case is more likely to be used
    in the non-PSC classes of links.\n      6.2. Procedures\n      The Egress Label
    subobject may appear only as the last subobject\n      in the ERO/ER.  Appearance
    of this subobject anywhere else in the\n      ERO/ER is treated as a \"Bad strict
    node\" error.\n      During an LSP setup, when a node processing the ERO/RR performs\n
    \     Next Hop selection finds that the second subobject is an Egress\n      Label
    Subobject, the node uses the information carried in this\n      subobject to determine
    the handling of the data received over that\n      LSP.  Specifically, if the
    Link ID field of the subobject is non\n      zero, then this field identifies
    a specific (outgoing) link of the\n      node that should be used for sending
    all the data received over\n      the LSP.  If the Label field of the subobject
    is not Implicit NULL\n      label, this field specifies the label that should
    be used as an\n      outgoing label on the data received over the LSP.\n      Procedures
    by which an LSR at the head-end of an LSP obtains the\n      information needed
    to construct the Egress Label subobject are\n      outside the scope of this document.\n"

    5.1.1 and 5.2.1 of\n   [RFC3473].  The procedures described in those sections
    are not\n   modified.  This section clarifies procedures related to the label\n
    \  used on an egress output/downstream interface.\n   The key words \"MUST\",
    \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD
    NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n   document are to
    be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].\n"

    - "2.1.  ERO Procedures\n   Egress Control occurs when the node processing an
      ERO is the egress\n   and the ERO contains one or more subobjects related to
      the\n   output/downstream interface.  In this case, the outgoing/downstream\n
      \  interface is indicated in the ERO as the last listed local interface.\n   Note
      that an interface may be numbered or unnumbered.\n   To support Egress Control,
      an egress checks to see whether the\n   received ERO contains an outgoing/downstream
      interface.  If it does,\n   the type of the subobject or subobjects following
      the interface is\n   examined.  If the associated LSP is unidirectional, one
      subobject is\n   examined.  Two subobjects are examined for bidirectional LSPs.
      \ If\n   the U-bit of the subobject being examined is clear (0), then the\n
      \  value of the label MUST be used for transmitting traffic associated\n   with
      the LSP on the indicated outgoing/downstream interface.\n   If the U-bit of
      the subobject being examined is set (1), then the\n   value of the label is
      used for upstream traffic associated with the\n   bidirectional LSP.  Specifically,
      the label value will be used for\n   the traffic associated with the LSP that
      will be received on the\n   indicated outgoing/downstream interface.\n   Per
      [RFC3473], any errors encountered while processing the ERO,\n   including if
      the listed label(s) are not acceptable or cannot be\n   supported in forwarding,
      SHOULD result in the generation of a PathErr\n   message with the error code
      \"Routing Error\" and error value of \"Bad\n   Explicit Route Object\".\n"
