  - "1.  Introduction\n   For many years, the assignment of new service names and\
    \ port number\n   values for use with the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)\
    \ [RFC0793]\n   and the User Datagram Protocol (UDP) [RFC0768] has had less than\n\
    \   clear guidelines.  New transport protocols have been added -- the\n   Stream\
    \ Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) [RFC4960] and the\n   Datagram Congestion\
    \ Control Protocol (DCCP) [RFC4342] -- and new\n   mechanisms like DNS SRV records\
    \ [RFC2782] have been developed, each\n   with separate registries and separate\
    \ guidelines.  The community also\n   recognized the need for additional procedures\
    \ beyond just assignment;\n   notably modification, revocation, and release.\n\
    \   A key element of the procedural streamlining specified in this\n   document\
    \ is to establish identical assignment procedures for all IETF\n   transport protocols.\
    \  This document brings the IANA procedures for\n   TCP and UDP in line with those\
    \ for SCTP and DCCP, resulting in a\n   single process that requesters and IANA\
    \ follow for all requests for\n   all transport protocols, including future protocols\
    \ not yet defined.\n   In addition to detailing the IANA procedures for the initial\n\
    \   assignment of service names and port numbers, this document also\n   specifies\
    \ post-assignment procedures that until now have been handled\n   in an ad hoc\
    \ manner.  These include procedures to de-assign a port\n   number that is no\
    \ longer in use, to take a port number assigned for\n   one service that is no\
    \ longer in use and reuse it for another\n   service, and the procedure by which\
    \ IANA can unilaterally revoke a\n   prior port number assignment.  Section 8\
    \ discusses the specifics of\n   these procedures and processes that requesters\
    \ and IANA follow for\n   all requests for all current and future transport protocols.\n\
    \   IANA is the authority for assigning service names and port numbers.\n   The\
    \ registries that are created to store these assignments are\n   maintained by\
    \ IANA.  For protocols developed by IETF working groups,\n   IANA now also offers\
    \ a method for the \"early assignment\" [RFC4020] of\n   service names and port\
    \ numbers, as described in Section 8.1.\n   This document updates IANA's procedures\
    \ for UDP and TCP port numbers\n   by obsoleting Sections 8 and 9.1 of the IANA\
    \ Allocation Guidelines\n   [RFC2780].  (Note that other sections of the IANA\
    \ Allocation\n   Guidelines, relating to the protocol field values in IPv4 headers,\n\
    \   were also updated in February 2008 [RFC5237].)  This document also\n   updates\
    \ the IANA assignment procedures for DCCP [RFC4340] [RFC5595]\n   and SCTP [RFC4960].\n\
    \   The Lightweight User Datagram Protocol (UDP-Lite) shares the port\n   space\
    \ with UDP.  The UDP-Lite specification [RFC3828] says: \"UDP-Lite\n   uses the\
    \ same set of port number values assigned by the IANA for use\n   by UDP\".  An\
    \ update of the UDP procedures therefore also results in a\n   corresponding update\
    \ of the UDP-Lite procedures.\n   This document also clarifies what a service\
    \ name is and how it is\n   assigned.  This will impact the DNS SRV specification\
    \ [RFC2782],\n   because that specification merely makes a brief mention that\
    \ the\n   symbolic names of services are defined in \"Assigned Numbers\"\n   [RFC1700],\
    \ without stating to which section it refers within that\n   230-page document.\
    \  The DNS SRV specification may have been referring\n   to the list of Port Assignments\
    \ (known as /etc/services on Unix), or\n   to the \"Protocol And Service Names\"\
    \ section, or to both, or to some\n   other section.  Furthermore, \"Assigned\
    \ Numbers\" [RFC1700] has been\n   obsoleted [RFC3232] and has been replaced by\
    \ on-line registries\n   [PORTREG] [PROTSERVREG].\n   The development of new transport\
    \ protocols is a major effort that the\n   IETF does not undertake very often.\
    \  If a new transport protocol is\n   standardized in the future, it is expected\
    \ to follow these guidelines\n   and practices around using service names and\
    \ port numbers as much as\n   possible, for consistency.\n   At the time of writing\
    \ of this document, the internal procedures of\n   \"Expert Review\" teams, including\
    \ that of IANA's port review team, are\n   not documented in any RFC and this\
    \ document doesn't change that.\n"
- title: 2.  Motivation
  contents:
  - "2.  Motivation\n   Information about the assignment procedures for the port registry\
    \ has\n   existed in three locations: the forms for requesting port number\n \
    \  assignments on the IANA web site [SYSFORM] [USRFORM], an introductory\n   text\
    \ section in the file listing the port number assignments\n   themselves (known\
    \ as the port numbers registry) [PORTREG], and two\n   brief sections of the IANA\
    \ Allocation Guidelines [RFC2780].\n   Similarly, the procedures surrounding service\
    \ names have been\n   historically unclear.  Service names were originally created\
    \ as\n   mnemonic identifiers for port numbers without a well-defined syntax,\n\
    \   apart from the 14-character limit mentioned on the IANA website\n   [SYSFORM]\
    \ [USRFORM].  Even that length limit has not been\n   consistently applied, and\
    \ some assigned service names are 15\n   characters long.  When service identification\
    \ via DNS SRV Resource\n   Records (RRs) was introduced [RFC2782], it became useful\
    \ to start\n   assigning service names alone, and because IANA had no procedure\
    \ for\n   assigning a service name without an associated port number, this led\n\
    \   to the creation of an informal temporary service name registry\n   outside\
    \ of the control of IANA, which now contains roughly 500\n   service names [SRVREG].\n\
    \   This document aggregates all this scattered information into a single\n  \
    \ reference that aligns and clearly defines the management procedures\n   for\
    \ both service names and port numbers.  It gives more detailed\n   guidance to\
    \ prospective requesters of service names and ports than\n   the existing documentation,\
    \ and it streamlines the IANA procedures\n   for the management of the registry,\
    \ so that requests can be completed\n   in a timely manner.\n   This document\
    \ defines rules for assignment of service names without\n   associated port numbers,\
    \ for such usages as DNS SRV records\n   [RFC2782], which was not possible under\
    \ the previous IANA procedures.\n   The document also merges service name assignments\
    \ from the non-IANA\n   ad hoc registry [SRVREG] and from the IANA Protocol and\
    \ Service Names\n   registry [PROTSERVREG] into the IANA Service Name and Transport\n\
    \   Protocol Port Number registry [PORTREG], which from here on is the\n   single\
    \ authoritative registry for service names and port numbers.\n   An additional\
    \ purpose of this document is to describe the principles\n   that guide the IETF\
    \ and IANA in their role as the long-term joint\n   stewards of the service name\
    \ and port number registry.  TCP and UDP\n   have had remarkable success over\
    \ the last decades.  Thousands of\n   applications and application-level protocols\
    \ have service names and\n   port numbers assigned for their use, and there is\
    \ every reason to\n   believe that this trend will continue into the future. \
    \ It is hence\n   extremely important that management of the registry follow principles\n\
    \   that ensure its long-term usefulness as a shared resource.  Section 7\n  \
    \ discusses these principles in detail.\n"
- title: 3.  Background
  contents:
  - "3.  Background\n   The Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) [RFC0793] and the\
    \ User\n   Datagram Protocol (UDP) [RFC0768] have enjoyed a remarkable success\n\
    \   over the decades as the two most widely used transport protocols on\n   the\
    \ Internet.  They have relied on the concept of \"ports\" as logical\n   entities\
    \ for Internet communication.  Ports serve two purposes:\n   first, they provide\
    \ a demultiplexing identifier to differentiate\n   transport sessions between\
    \ the same pair of endpoints, and second,\n   they may also identify the application\
    \ protocol and associated\n   service to which processes connect.  Newer transport\
    \ protocols, such\n   as the Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) [RFC4960]\
    \ and the\n   Datagram Congestion Control Protocol (DCCP) [RFC4342], have also\n\
    \   adopted the concept of ports for their communication sessions and use\n  \
    \ 16-bit port numbers in the same way as TCP and UDP (and UDP-Lite\n   [RFC3828],\
    \ a variant of UDP).\n   Port numbers are the original and most widely used means\
    \ for\n   application and service identification on the Internet.  Ports are\n\
    \   16-bit numbers, and the combination of source and destination port\n   numbers\
    \ together with the IP addresses of the communicating end\n   systems uniquely\
    \ identifies a session of a given transport protocol.\n   Port numbers are also\
    \ known by their associated service names such as\n   \"telnet\" for port number\
    \ 23 and \"http\" (as well as \"www\" and\n   \"www-http\") for port number 80.\n\
    \   All involved parties -- hosts running services, hosts accessing\n   services\
    \ on other hosts, and intermediate devices (such as firewalls\n   and NATs) that\
    \ restrict services -- need to agree on which service\n   corresponds to a particular\
    \ destination port.  Although this is\n   ultimately a local decision with meaning\
    \ only between the endpoints\n   of a connection, it is common for many services\
    \ to have a default\n   port upon which those servers usually listen, when possible,\
    \ and\n   these ports are recorded by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority\n\
    \   (IANA) through the service name and port number registry [PORTREG].\n   Over\
    \ time, the assumption that a particular port number necessarily\n   implies a\
    \ particular service may become less true.  For example,\n   multiple instances\
    \ of the same service on the same host cannot\n   generally listen on the same\
    \ port, and multiple hosts behind the same\n   NAT gateway cannot all have a mapping\
    \ for the same port on the\n   external side of the NAT gateway, whether using\
    \ static port mappings\n   configured by hand by the user, or dynamic port mappings\
    \ configured\n   automatically using a port mapping protocol like the NAT Port\
    \ Mapping\n   Protocol [NAT-PMP] or Internet Gateway Device [IGD].\n   Applications\
    \ may use port numbers directly, look up port numbers\n   based on service names\
    \ via system calls such as getservbyname() on\n   UNIX, look up port numbers by\
    \ performing queries for DNS SRV records\n   [RFC2782] [DNS-SD], or determine\
    \ port numbers in a variety of other\n   ways like the TCP Port Service Multiplexer\
    \ (TCPMUX) [RFC1078].\n   Designers of applications and application-level protocols\
    \ may apply\n   to IANA for an assigned service name and port number for a specific\n\
    \   application, and may -- after assignment -- assume that no other\n   application\
    \ will use that service name or port number for its\n   communication sessions.\
    \  Application designers also have the option\n   of requesting only an assigned\
    \ service name without a corresponding\n   fixed port number if their application\
    \ does not require one, such as\n   applications that use DNS SRV records to look\
    \ up port numbers\n   dynamically at run-time.  Because the port number space\
    \ is finite\n   (and therefore conservation is an important goal), the alternative\
    \ of\n   using service names instead of port numbers is RECOMMENDED whenever\n\
    \   possible.\n"

- title: 5.  Service Names
  contents:
  - "5.  Service Names\n   Service names are the unique key in the Service Name and\
    \ Transport\n   Protocol Port Number registry.  This unique symbolic name for\
    \ a\n   service may also be used for other purposes, such as in DNS SRV\n   records\
    \ [RFC2782].  Within the registry, this unique key ensures that\n   different\
    \ services can be unambiguously distinguished, thus\n   preventing name collisions\
    \ and avoiding confusion about who is the\n   Assignee for a particular entry.\n\
    \   There may be more than one service name associated with a particular\n   transport\
    \ protocol and port.  There are three ways that such port\n   number overloading\
    \ can occur:\n   o  Overloading occurs when one service is an extension of another\n\
    \      service, and an in-band mechanism exists for determining if the\n     \
    \ extension is present or not.  One example is port 3478, which has\n      the\
    \ service name aliases \"stun\" and \"turn\".  Traversal Using\n      Relays around\
    \ NAT (TURN) [RFC5766] is an extension to the Session\n      Traversal Utilities\
    \ for NAT (STUN) [RFC5389] service.  TURN-\n      enabled clients wishing to locate\
    \ TURN servers could attempt to\n      discover \"stun\" services and then check\
    \ in-band if the server also\n      supports TURN, but this would be inefficient.\
    \  Enabling them to\n      directly query for \"turn\" servers by name is a better\
    \ approach.\n      (Note that TURN servers in this case should also be locatable\
    \ via\n      a \"stun\" discovery, because every TURN server is also a STUN\n\
    \      server.)\n   o  By historical accident, the service name \"http\" has two\
    \ synonyms\n      \"www\" and \"www-http\".  When used in SRV records [RFC2782]\
    \ and\n      similar service discovery mechanisms, only the service name \"http\"\
    \n      should be used, not these additional names.  If a server were to\n   \
    \   advertise \"www\", it would not be discovered by clients browsing\n      for\
    \ \"http\".  Advertising or browsing for the aliases as well as\n      the primary\
    \ service name is inefficient, and achieves nothing that\n      is not already\
    \ achieved by using the service name \"http\"\n      exclusively.\n   o  As indicated\
    \ in this document in Section 10.1, overloading has\n      been used to create\
    \ replacement names that are consistent with the\n      syntax this document prescribes\
    \ for legacy names that do not\n      conform to this syntax already.  For such\
    \ cases, only the new name\n      should be used in SRV records, to avoid the\
    \ same issues as with\n      historical cases of multiple names, and also because\
    \ the legacy\n      names are incompatible with SRV record use.\n   Assignment\
    \ requests for new names for existing registered services\n   will be rejected,\
    \ as a result.  Implementers are requested to inform\n   IANA if they discover\
    \ other cases where a single service has multiple\n   names, so that one name\
    \ may be recorded as the primary name for\n   service discovery purposes.\n  \
    \ Service names are assigned on a \"first come, first served\" basis, as\n   described\
    \ in Section 8.1.  Names should be brief and informative,\n   avoiding words or\
    \ abbreviations that are redundant in the context of\n   the registry (e.g., \"\
    port\", \"service\", \"protocol\", etc.)  Names\n   referring to discovery services,\
    \ e.g., using multicast or broadcast\n   to identify endpoints capable of a given\
    \ service, SHOULD use an\n   easily identifiable suffix (e.g., \"-disc\").\n"
- title: 5.1.  Service Name Syntax
  contents:
  - "5.1.  Service Name Syntax\n   Valid service names are hereby normatively defined\
    \ as follows:\n   o  MUST be at least 1 character and no more than 15 characters\
    \ long\n   o  MUST contain only US-ASCII [ANSI.X3.4-1986] letters 'A' - 'Z' and\n\
    \      'a' - 'z', digits '0' - '9', and hyphens ('-', ASCII 0x2D or\n      decimal\
    \ 45)\n   o  MUST contain at least one letter ('A' - 'Z' or 'a' - 'z')\n   o \
    \ MUST NOT begin or end with a hyphen\n   o  hyphens MUST NOT be adjacent to other\
    \ hyphens\n   The reason for requiring at least one letter is to avoid service\n\
    \   names like \"23\" (could be confused with a numeric port) or \"6000-\n   6063\"\
    \ (could be confused with a numeric port range).  Although\n   service names may\

    \ example, a company called \"Example\" may choose\n   to register service names\
    \ \"Example-Foo\" and \"Example-Bar\" for its\n   \"Foo\" and \"Bar\" products,\
    \ but the \"Example\" company cannot claim to\n   \"own\" all service names beginning\
    \ with \"Example-\"; they cannot\n   prevent someone else from registering \"\
    Example-Baz\" for a different\n   service, and they cannot prevent other developers\
    \ from using the\n   \"Example-Foo\" and \"Example-Bar\" service types in order\
    \ to\n   interoperate with the \"Foo\" and \"Bar\" products.  Technically\n  \
    \ speaking, in service discovery protocols, service names are merely a\n   series\
    \ of byte values on the wire; for the mnemonic convenience of\n   human developers,\
    \ it can be convenient to interpret those byte values\n   as human-readable ASCII\
    \ characters, but software should treat them as\n   purely opaque identifiers\
    \ and not attempt to parse them for any\n   additional embedded meaning.\n   As\
    \ of August 5, 2009, approximately 98% of the so-called \"Short\n   Names\" [SYSFORM]\
    \ [USRFORM] for existing port number assignments\n   [PORTREG] already met the\
    \ rules for legal service names stated in\n   Section 8.1, and hence for these\
    \ services their service name is\n   exactly the same as their historical \"Short\
    \ Name\".  In approximately\n   2% of cases, the new \"service name\" is derived\
    \ based on the old\n   \"Short Name\" as described below in Section 10.1.\n  \
    \ The rules for valid service names, excepting the limit of 15\n   characters\
    \ maximum, are also expressed below (as a non-normative\n   convenience) using\
    \ ABNF [RFC5234].\n      SRVNAME = *(1*DIGIT [HYPHEN]) ALPHA *([HYPHEN] ALNUM)\n\
    \      ALNUM   = ALPHA / DIGIT     ; A-Z, a-z, 0-9\n      HYPHEN  = %x2D     \

    \ as the Private or Ephemeral Ports,\n      from 49152-65535 (never assigned)\n\
    \   Of the assignable port ranges (System Ports and User Ports, i.e.,\n   port\

- title: 7.1.  Past Principles

  - "7.1.  Past Principles\n   The principles for service name and port number management\

    \ on the review experience from previous assignment requests.\n   These original\
    \ guidelines, although informal, had never been publicly\n   documented.  They\
    \ are recorded here for historical purposes only; the\n   current guidelines are\
    \ described in Section 7.2.  These guidelines\n   previously were:\n   o  TCP\
    \ and UDP ports were simultaneously assigned when either was\n      requested\n\
    \   o  Port numbers were the primary assignment; service names were\n      informative\
    \ only, and did not have a well-defined syntax\n   o  Port numbers were conserved\
    \ informally, and sometimes\n      inconsistently (e.g., some services were assigned\
    \ ranges of many\n      port numbers even where not strictly necessary)\n   o\
    \  SCTP and DCCP service name and port number registries were managed\n      separately\
    \ from the TCP/UDP registries\n   o  Service names could not be assigned in the\
    \ old ports registry\n      without assigning an associated port number at the\
    \ same time\n"
- title: 7.2.  Updated Principles
  contents:
  - "7.2.  Updated Principles\n   This section summarizes the current principles by\
    \ which IANA both\n   handles the Service Name and Transport Protocol Port Number\
    \ registry\n   and attempts to conserve the port number space.  This description\
    \ is\n   intended to inform applicants requesting service names and port\n   numbers.\
    \  IANA has flexibility beyond these principles when handling\n   assignment requests;\
    \ other factors may come into play, and exceptions\n   may be made to best serve\
    \ the needs of the Internet.  Applicants\n   should be aware that IANA decisions\
    \ are not required to be bound to\n   these principles.  These principles and\
    \ general advice to users on\n   port use are expected to change over time.\n\
    \   IANA strives to assign service names that do not request an\n   associated\
    \ port number assignment under a simple \"First Come First\n   Served\" policy\
    \ [RFC5226].  IANA MAY, at its discretion, refer service\n   name requests to\
    \ \"Expert Review\" in cases of mass assignment requests\n   or other situations\
    \ where IANA believes \"Expert Review\" is advisable\n   [RFC5226]; use of the\
    \ \"Expert Review\" helps advise IANA informally in\n   cases where \"IETF Review\"\
    \ or \"IESG Approval\" is used, as with most\n   IETF protocols.\n   The basic\
    \ principle of service name and port number registry\n   management is to conserve\
    \ use of the port space where possible.\n   Extensions to support larger port\
    \ number spaces would require\n   changing many core protocols of the current\
    \ Internet in a way that\n   would not be backward compatible and interfere with\
    \ both current and\n   legacy applications.\n   Conservation of the port number\
    \ space is required because this space\n   is a limited resource, so applications\
    \ are expected to participate in\n   the traffic demultiplexing process where\
    \ feasible.  The port numbers\n   are expected to encode as little information\
    \ as possible that will\n   still enable an application to perform further demultiplexing\
    \ by\n   itself.  In particular, the principles form a goal that IANA strives\n\
    \   to achieve for new applications (with exceptions as deemed\n   appropriate,\
    \ especially as for extensions to legacy services) as\n   follows:\n   o  IANA\
    \ strives to assign only one assigned port number per service\n      or application.\n\
    \      Note: At the time of writing of this document, there is no IETF\n     \
    \ consensus on when it is appropriate to use a second port for an\n      insecure\
    \ version of a protocol.\n   o  IANA strives to assign only one assigned port\
    \ number for all\n      variants of a service (e.g., for updated versions of a\
    \ service).\n   o  IANA strives to encourage the deployment of secure protocols.\n\
    \   o  IANA strives to assign only one assigned port number for all\n      different\
    \ types of devices using or participating in the same\n      service.\n   o  IANA\
    \ strives to assign port numbers only for the transport\n      protocol(s) explicitly\
    \ named in an assignment request.\n   o  IANA may recover unused port numbers,\
    \ via the new procedures of\n      de-assignment, revocation, and transfer.\n\
    \   Where possible, a given service is expected to demultiplex messages\n   if\
    \ necessary.  For example, applications and protocols are expected\n   to include\
    \ in-band version information, so that future versions of\n   the application\
    \ or protocol can share the same assigned port.\n   Applications and protocols\
    \ are also expected to be able to\n   efficiently use a single assigned port for\
    \ multiple sessions, either\n   by demultiplexing multiple streams within one\
    \ port or by using the\n   assigned port to coordinate using dynamic ports for\
    \ subsequent\n   exchanges (e.g., in the spirit of FTP [RFC0959]).\n   Ports are\
    \ used in various ways, notably:\n   o  as endpoint process identifiers\n   o\
    \  as application protocol identifiers\n   o  for firewall-filtering purposes\n\
    \   Both the process-identifier and the protocol-identifier uses suggest\n   that\
    \ anything a single process can demultiplex, or that can be\n   encoded into a\
    \ single protocol, should be.  The firewall-filtering\n   use suggests that some\
    \ uses that could be multiplexed or encoded\n   could instead be separated to\
    \ allow for easier firewall management.\n   Note that this latter use is much\
    \ less sound, because port numbers\n   have meaning only for the two endpoints\
    \ involved in a connection, and\n   drawing conclusions about the service that\
    \ generated a given flow\n   based on observed port numbers is not always reliable.\n\
    \   Effective with the publication of this document, IANA will begin\n   assigning\
    \ port numbers for only those transport protocols explicitly\n   included in an\
    \ assignment request.  This ends the long-standing\n   practice of automatically\
    \ assigning a port number to an application\n   for both TCP and UDP, even if\
    \ the request is for only one of these\n   transport protocols.  The new assignment\
    \ procedure conserves\n   resources by assigning a port number to an application\
    \ for only those\n   transport protocols (TCP, UDP, SCTP, and/or DCCP) it actually\
    \ uses.\n   The port number will be marked as Reserved -- instead of Assigned\
    \ --\n   in the port number registries of the other transport protocols.  When\n\
    \   applications start supporting the use of some of those additional\n   transport\
    \ protocols, the Assignee for the assignment MUST request\n   that IANA convert\
    \ these reserved ports into assignments.  An\n   application MUST NOT assume that\
    \ it can use a port number assigned to\n   it for use with one transport protocol\
    \ with another transport\n   protocol without IANA converting the reservation\
    \ into an assignment.\n   When the available pool of unassigned numbers has run\
    \ out in a port\n   range, it will be necessary for IANA to consider the Reserved\
    \ ports\n   for assignment.  This is part of the motivation for not automatically\n\
    \   assigning ports for transport protocols other than the requested\n   one(s).\
    \  This will allow more ports to be available for assignment at\n   that point.\
    \  To help conserve ports, application developers SHOULD\n   request assignment\
    \ of only those transport protocols that their\n   application currently uses.\n\
    \   Conservation of port numbers is improved by procedures that allow\n   previously\
    \ assigned port numbers to become Unassigned, either through\n   de-assignment\
    \ or through revocation, and by a procedure that lets\n   application designers\
    \ transfer an assigned but unused port number to\n   a new application.  Section\
    \ 8 describes these procedures, which until\n   now were undocumented.  Port number\
    \ conservation is also improved by\n   recommending that applications that do\
    \ not require an assigned port\n   should register only a service name without\
    \ an associated port\n   number.\n"

- title: 8.1.2.  Variances for Specific Port Number Ranges
  contents:
  - "8.1.2.  Variances for Specific Port Number Ranges\n   Section 6 describes the\
    \ different port number ranges.  It is\n   important to note that IANA applies\
    \ slightly different procedures\n   when managing the different port ranges of\
    \ the service name and port\n   number registry:\n   o  Ports in the Dynamic Ports\
    \ range (49152-65535) have been\n      specifically set aside for local and dynamic\
    \ use and cannot be\n      assigned through IANA.  Application software may simply\
    \ use any\n      dynamic port that is available on the local host, without any\
    \ sort\n      of assignment.  On the other hand, application software MUST NOT\n\
    \      assume that a specific port number in the Dynamic Ports range will\n  \
    \    always be available for communication at all times, and a port\n      number\
    \ in that range hence MUST NOT be used as a service\n      identifier.\n   o \
    \ Ports in the User Ports range (1024-49151) are available for\n      assignment\
    \ through IANA, and MAY be used as service identifiers\n      upon successful\
    \ assignment.  Because assigning a port number for a\n      specific application\
    \ consumes a fraction of the shared resource\n      that is the port number registry,\
    \ IANA will require the requester\n      to document the intended use of the port\
    \ number.  For most IETF\n      protocols, ports in the User Ports range will\
    \ be assigned under\n      the \"IETF Review\" or \"IESG Approval\" procedures\
    \ [RFC5226] and no\n      further documentation is required.  Where these procedures\
    \ do not\n      apply, then the requester must input the documentation to the\n\
    \      \"Expert Review\" procedure [RFC5226], by which IANA will have a\n    \
    \  technical expert review the request to determine whether to grant\n      the\
    \ assignment.  Regardless of the path (\"IETF Review\", \"IESG\n      Approval\"\
    , or \"Expert Review\"), the submitted documentation is\n      expected to be\
    \ the same, as described in this section, and MUST\n      explain why using a\
    \ port number in the Dynamic Ports range is\n      unsuitable for the given application.\
    \  Further, IANA MAY utilize\n      the \"Expert Review\" process informally to\
    \ inform their position in\n      participating in \"IETF Review\" and \"IESG\
    \ Approval\".\n   o  Ports in the System Ports range (0-1023) are also available\
    \ for\n      assignment through IANA.  Because the System Ports range is both\n\
    \      the smallest and the most densely assigned, the requirements for\n    \
    \  new assignments are more strict than those for the User Ports\n      range,\
    \ and will only be granted under the \"IETF Review\" or \"IESG\n      Approval\"\
    \ procedures [RFC5226].  A request for a System Port\n      number MUST document\
    \ *both* why using a port number from the\n      Dynamic Ports range is unsuitable\
    \ *and* why using a port number\n      from the User Ports range is unsuitable\
    \ for that application.\n"

  contents:
  - "8.3.  Service Name and Port Number Reuse\n   If the Assignee of a granted port\
    \ number assignment no longer has a\n   need for the assigned number, but would\
    \ like to reuse it for a\n   different application, they can submit a request\
    \ to IANA to do so.\n   Logically, port number reuse is to be thought of as a\
    \ de-assignment\n   (Section 8.2) followed by an immediate (re-)assignment (Section\
    \ 8.1)\n   of the same port number for a new application.  Consequently, the\n\
    \   information that needs to be provided about the proposed new use of\n   the\
    \ port number is identical to what would need to be provided for a\n   new port\
    \ number assignment for the specific ports range.\n   Because there is much less\
    \ danger of exhausting the service name\n   space compared to the port number\
    \ space, it is RECOMMENDED that the\n   original service name associated with\
    \ the prior use of the port\n   number remains assigned, and a new service name\
    \ be created and\n   associated with the port number.  This is again consistent\
    \ with\n   viewing a reuse request as a de-assignment followed by an immediate\n\
    \   (re-)assignment.  Reusing an assigned service name for a different\n   application\
    \ is NOT RECOMMENDED.\n   IANA needs to carefully review such requests before\
    \ approving them.\n   In some instances, the Expert Reviewer will determine that\
    \ the\n   application the port number was assigned to has found usage beyond\n\
    \   the original Assignee, or that there is a concern that it may have\n   such\
    \ users.  This determination MUST be made quickly.  A community\n   call concerning\
    \ revocation of a port number (see below) MAY be\n   considered, if a broader\

  contents:
  - "8.4.  Service Name and Port Number Revocation\n   A port number revocation can\
    \ be thought of as an IANA-initiated de-\n   assignment (Section 8.2), and has\
    \ exactly the same effect on the\n   registry.\n   Sometimes, it will be clear\
    \ that a specific port number is no longer\n   in use and that IANA can revoke\
    \ it and mark it as Reserved.  At other\n   times, it may be unclear whether a\
    \ given assigned port number is\n   still in use somewhere in the Internet.  In\
    \ those cases, IANA must\n   carefully consider the consequences of revoking the\
    \ port number, and\n   SHOULD only do so if there is an overwhelming need.\n \
    \  With the help of their IESG-appointed Expert Reviewer, IANA SHALL\n   formulate\
    \ a request to the IESG to issue a four-week community call\n   concerning the\
    \ pending port number revocation.  The IESG and IANA,\n   with the Expert Reviewer's\
    \ support, SHALL determine promptly after\n   the end of the community call whether\

    \   As of August 5, 2009, approximately 98% of the so-called \"Short\n   Names\"\
    \ from existing port number assignments [PORTREG] met the rules\n   for legal\

  - "10.3.  Updates to DCCP Registries\n   This document updates the IANA assignment\
    \ procedures for the DCCP\n   Port Number and DCCP Service Codes Registries [RFC4340].\n"
- title: 10.3.1.  DCCP Service Code Registry
  contents:
  - "10.3.1.  DCCP Service Code Registry\n   Service codes are assigned on a \"first\
    \ come, first served\" basis\n   according to Section 19.8 of the DCCP specification\
    \ [RFC4340].  This\n   document updates that section by extending the guidelines\
    \ given there\n   in the following ways:\n   o  IANA MAY assign new service codes\
    \ without seeking \"Expert Review\"\n      using their discretion, but SHOULD\
    \ seek \"Expert Review\" if a\n      request asks for more than five service codes.\n\
    \   o  IANA should feel free to contact the DCCP Expert Reviewer with any\n  \
    \    questions related to requests for DCCP-related codepoints.\n"
- title: 10.3.2.  DCCP Port Numbers Registry
  contents:
  - "10.3.2.  DCCP Port Numbers Registry\n   The DCCP ports registry is defined by\
    \ Section 19.9 of the DCCP\n   specification [RFC4340].  Assignments in this registry\
    \ require prior\n   assignment of a service code.  Not all service codes require\
    \ IANA-\n   assigned ports.  This document updates that section by extending the\n\
    \   guidelines given there in the following way:\n   o  IANA should normally assign\
    \ a value in the range 1024-49151 to a\n      DCCP server port.  IANA requests\
    \ to assign port numbers in the\n      System Ports range (0 through 1023) require\
    \ an \"IETF Review\"\n      [RFC5226] prior to assignment by IANA [RFC4340].\n\
    \   o  IANA MUST NOT assign more than one DCCP server port to a single\n     \
    \ service code value.\n   o  The assignment of multiple service codes to the same\
    \ DCCP port is\n      allowed, but subject to \"Expert Review\".\n   o  The set\
    \ of service code values associated with a DCCP server port\n      should be recorded\
    \ in the service name and port number registry.\n   o  A request for additional\
    \ service codes to be associated with an\n      already assigned port number requires\
    \ \"Expert Review\".  These\n      requests will normally be accepted when they\
    \ originate from the\n      contact associated with the port assignment.  In other\
    \ cases,\n      these applications will be expected to use an unassigned port,\n\
    \      when this is available.\n   The DCCP specification [RFC4340] notes that\
    \ a short port name MUST be\n   associated with each DCCP server port that has\
    \ been assigned.  This\n   document clarifies that this short port name is the\
    \ service name as\n   defined here, and this name MUST be unique.\n"
