  - "                     An Official Protocol Mechanism\nDuring the Spring Joint\
    \ Computer Conference in Atlantic City, Larry\nRoberts, Barry Wessler, Cordell\
    \ Green, Jon Postel and I discussed rules\nfor establishing and modifying an official\
    \ Host-Host protocol.\nThe following decisions were made:\n      1.  A new set\
    \ of documents will be created.  This set of\n          documents will specify\
    \ the official Host-Host protocol.  When\n          it becomes appropriate, these\
    \ documents will be maintained at\n          the Network Information Center on\
    \ SRI's computer.\n      2.  I will distribute proposals for the initial version\
    \ of the\n          official protocol and all subsequent changes as NWG/RFC's.\n\
    \          These proposals will be formulated from suggestions made by\n     \
    \     any interested parties.\n      3.  After a proposal for a change in the\
    \ official protocol\n          has been issued as an NWG/RFC, networkers are requested\
    \ to\n          respond with approval, criticism, etc.  A cutoff date will be\n\
    \          included with each protocol.\n      4.  After the cutoff date, one\
    \ of two situations will prevail.\n          Either the proposal will have been\
    \ substantially accepted by\n          the network community, or substantial criticism\
    \ will have been\n          generated.  In the latter case, the process stops\
    \ and no\n          change occurs to the official protocol.\n      5.  If the\
    \ proposal has been substantially accepted, the\n          proposal, together\
    \ with its minor revisions will be forwarded\n          to the ARPA office.  Barry\
    \ Wessler or his successor will then\n          either approve or disapprove the\
    \ whole proposal.  His decision\n          will be returned to me by letter.\n\
    \      6.  After the ARPA office approves the proposal, I will send\n        \
    \  out the new protocol (as mentioned in item 1 above).\nThe first version of\
    \ an official protocol will be proferred this month.\n       [ This RFC was put\
    \ into machine readable form for entry ]\n[ into the online RFC archives by Kathy\
    \ de Graaf 2/98 ]\n"
