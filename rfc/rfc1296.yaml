    \   This document provides statistics on the growth of the Internet by\n   examining\
    \ the number of Internet hosts and domains over a 10-year\n   period.  Before\
    \ the Domain Name System was established, practically\n   all hosts on the Internet\
    \ were registered with the Network\n   Information Center (SRI-NIC) and entries\
    \ were placed in the Official\n   Host Table for each one.  Data on the number\
    \ of hosts for pre-DNS\n   years comes from copies of the host table at selected\
    \ times.  The DNS\n   system was introduced around 1984 but took almost 4 years\
    \ before it\n   was fully implemented on the Internet.  However, by this time\
    \ many\n   hosts were no longer registered in the Host Table.\n   In 1986, the\
    \ ZONE (Zealot Of Name Edification) program was written.\n   ZONE was originally\
    \ intended to be used during the host-table-to-DNS\n   transition period.  ZONE\
    \ would \"walk\" the DNS tree and build a host\n   table of all the information\
    \ it collected.  This host table could\n   then be used by sites that had not\
    \ yet made the DNS transition.\n   However, ZONE was never used for this purpose.\
    \  Instead, it was found\n   to be useful for collecting statistics on the size\
    \ of the domain\n   system and the Internet.\n   ZONE could not collect complete\
    \ data on the DNS until around 1988,\n   because early versions of BIND (the popular\
    \ Unix DNS implementation)\n   had major problems with the zone transfer function\
    \ of the DNS\n   protocol.  ZONE has been used in varying ways ever since to collect\n\
    \   this information.  In the first few years, it was used to produce a\n   wall-size\
    \ chart of the domain tree.  However, the number of domains\n   quickly outgrew\
    \ the size of the wall and the charts were abandoned.\n   In later years, statistics\
    \ on the number of hosts and domains were\n   extracted from the resulting host\
    \ table, sometimes categorizing data\n   based on top-level domain names or on\
    \ computer system type or\n   manufacturer.\n   The time to gather the data also\
    \ grew from hours to a week, and the\n   size of the host table produced soon\
    \ reached 50 megabytes.  In order\n   to reduce the amount of data collected,\
    \ ZONE is now run in a mode\n   collecting only host names and IP addresses, ignoring\
    \ protocol, host\n   information and MX record data.  The host table is then groveled\
    \ over\n   by some utilities (such as sort, uniq and grep) to produce the\n  \
    \ statistics required.  ZONE is currently run every 3 months at SRI.\nHow ZONE\
    \ Works\n   ZONE maintains a list of domains and their servers and a flag\n  \
    \ indicating whether information for a domain has been successfully\n   loaded\
    \ from one of the servers. Because of another bug in BIND, ZONE\n   must be primed\
    \ with a list of all the top-level domains and their\n   name servers.  It then\
    \ cycles through the domain list, attempting to\n   contact one of the servers\
    \ for each domain not yet transferred.  When\n   a server is contacted (via TCP),\
    \ a Start of Authority (SOA) query is\n   first sent to make sure the server is\
    \ authoritative for the domain\n   being requested.  If so, then a zone transfer\
    \ query (AXFR) is sent to\n   request all the resource records for the domain\
    \ to be retrieved.\n   When a name server record (NS) is received, the referenced\
    \ domain and\n   server are added to the list of domains to process.  When host\n\
    \   records (A, CNAME, HINFO, MX) are received, they are added to an in-\n   core\
    \ table of host information.  The program ends when it has cycled\n   through\
    \ the entire list of domains without receiving any new\n   information.  It then\
    \ dumps the table of host information to a\n   HOSTS.TXT format file.\nProblems\
    \ with Data Collection\n   For various reasons, some Internet sites do not allow\
    \ zone transfers\n   of their domain servers.  ZONE also eventually gives up trying\
    \ to\n   transfer a domain after too many failures.  The number of domains\n \
    \  that could not be zone transferred during the 1-Jan-92 ZONE run was\n   around\
    \ 800 out of 17,000.  Additionally, it is assumed that not all\n   hosts on the\
    \ Internet are registered in a domain server.  These\n   problems cause the statistics\
    \ gathered by ZONE to be lower than the\n   actual amounts.\n   Manual review\
    \ of some of the data collected by ZONE also shows a lot\n   of random entries\
    \ in the DNS.  Misformatted entries may cause bogus\n   server or host records\
    \ to appear.  Many times a server is found to\n   not be authoritative for the\
    \ domain listed.  Sometimes entire domains\n   are renamed and their old entries\
    \ left in place for a transition\n   period, thus causing each host within that\
    \ domain to be counted\n   twice.  These problems cause the results of ZONE to\
    \ be higher than\n   the actual amounts.\n   Manual scanning of the data indicates\
    \ that the additional entries are\n   insignificant compared to the missing entries\
    \ discussed earlier.\n   ZONE data can thus be viewed as the minimum number of\
    \ Internet hosts,\n   and not the actual figures.\n   A final problem with data\
    \ collection is that of expense.  Downloading\n   domain information from every\
    \ domain on the Internet generates a\n   large amount of network traffic.  It\
    \ also puts an extra CPU load on\n   each domain server it must contact.  An organized\
    \ effort might be\n   considered to have only one such program doing this on the\
    \ Internet\n   at regularly scheduled intervals to keep the problem of multiple\
    \ data\n   collectors from occurring.\nScope of the Study\n   A problem with counting\
    \ hosts and domains on the Internet is defining\n   what the Internet really is.\
    \  Finding host entries in the DNS does\n   not necessarily indicate that the\
    \ host is reachable from the\n   Internet.  Many companies have mail gateways\
    \ between the Internet and\n   their local nets, thus disallowing direct access.\
    \  However, some of\n   these companies advertise all their hosts, and some advertise\
    \ only\n   the gateway.  Are these hosts on the Internet or not?\n   Furthermore,\
    \ many domains in the DNS are just mail-forwarding (MX)\n   entries for off-Internet\
    \ (such as Usenet) sites.  Are these domains\n   really part of the Internet and\
    \ should they be counted in an Internet\n   size study?\n   For the purposes of\
    \ this study, a host has been defined as a\n   [name(s),IP-address(es)] grouping\
    \ discovered from the DNS.  This\n   prevents us from counting a host with multiple\
    \ names or addresses\n   more than once.  However, this does not consider whether\
    \ the host is\n   directly accessible or not.  When ZONE counts the number of\
    \ domains\n   it includes all domains referenced by an NS record in the DNS, thus\n\
    \   including MX-only domain sites in the final results.\nN. Results\n   This\

    \ runs on a DECsystem-20 and is written in assembler.\n   The amount of data is\
    \ quickly reaching the limits of the DEC-20\n   section address space, and the\
    \ hardware's ability to survive gets\n   slimmer each day.  ZONE assembles all\
    \ its data in core before dumping\n   it to disk.  The implementation does this\
    \ in order to be able to\n   match host nicknames with official names before dumping\
    \ complete host\n   records.  Sometimes a nickname can be in a different domain\
    \ than the\n   official name, complicating simpler methods.\n   A new version\
    \ of ZONE needs to be written to run on a modern computer\n   system.  A completely\
    \ new architecture should be designed to handle\n   the enormous amount of data\
    \ collected and expected in the future.\n   Data should be kept on disk so that\
    \ a system crash will not wipe out\n   days of collection.  Multiple zone transfers\
    \ could be occurring in\n   parallel to reduce the time needed for data gathering.\
    \  A new ZONE\n   might run continuously, cycling through the domain system on\
    \ a cycle\n   lasting weeks to a month, updating a local database with statistics\n\
    \   collected for each domain.  In this way, current statistics on the\n   size\
    \ of the Internet would always be known.  The resulting database\n   may also\
    \ be useful for other network information services.\nRFC References\n   Libes,\
