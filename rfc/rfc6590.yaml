  - "1.  Introduction\n   The Abuse Reporting Format [ARF] defines a message format\
    \ for sending\n   reports of abuse in the messaging infrastructure, with an eye\
    \ toward\n   automating both the generation and consumption of those reports.\n\
    \   For privacy considerations, it might be the policy of a report\n   generator\
    \ to anonymize, or obscure, portions of the report that might\n   identify an\
    \ end user who caused the report to be generated.  This has\n   come to be known\
    \ in feedback loop parlance as \"redaction\".  Precisely\n   how this is done\
    \ is unspecified in [ARF], as it will generally be a\n   matter of local policy.\
    \  That specification does admonish generators\n   against being too overzealous\
    \ with this practice, as obscuring too\n   much data makes the report non-actionable.\n\
    \   Previous redaction practices, such as replacing local-parts of\n   addresses\
    \ with a uniform string like \"xxxxxxxx\", frustrated any kind\n   of prioritizing\
    \ or grouping of reports.  This memo presents a\n   practice for conducting redaction\
    \ in a manner that allows a report\n   receiver to detect that two reports were\
    \ caused by the same end user,\n   without revealing the identity of that user.\
    \  That is, the report\n   receiver can use the redacted string, such as an obscured\
    \ email\n   address, to determine that two such unredacted strings were\n   identical;\
    \ the reports originally contained the same address.\n   Generally, it is assumed\
    \ that the recipient-identifying fields of a\n   message, when copied into a report,\
    \ are to be obscured to protect the\n   identity of the end user who submitted\
    \ the complaint about the\n   message.  However, it is also presumed that other\
    \ data will be left\n   intact, and those data could be correlated against log\
    \ files or other\n   resources to determine the intended recipient of the original\n\
    \   message.\n"

  contents:
  - "2.  Key Words\n   The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\"\
    , \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and\
    \ \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n   document are to be interpreted as described in [KEYWORDS].\n"
- title: 3.  Recommended Practice
  contents:
  - "3.  Recommended Practice\n   When redacting of reports is desired, in order to\
    \ enable a report\n   receiver to correlate reports that might refer to a common\
    \ but\n   anonymous source, the report generator SHOULD use the following\n  \
    \ practice:\n   1.  Select a transformation mechanism (see Section 4) that is\n\
    \       consistent (i.e., the same input string produces the same output\n   \
    \    each time) and reasonably collision-resistant (i.e., two\n       different\
    \ inputs are unlikely to produce the same output).\n   2.  Identify string(s)\
    \ (such as local-parts of email addresses) in a\n       message that need to be\
    \ redacted.  Call these strings the\n       \"private data\".\n   3.  For each\
    \ piece of private data, apply the selected transformation\n       mechanism.\n\
    \   4.  If the output of the transformation can contain bytes that are\n     \
    \  not printable ASCII, or if the output can include characters not\n       appropriate\
    \ to replace the private data directly, encode the\n       output with the base64\
    \ algorithm as defined in Section 4 of\n       [BASE64], or some similar translation,\
    \ to form a valid\n       replacement in the original context.  For example, replacing\
    \ a\n       local-part in an email address with transformation output\n      \
    \ containing an \"@\" character (ASCII 0x40) or a space character\n       (ASCII\
    \ 0x20) is not permitted by the specification for local-part\n       [SMTP], so\
    \ the transformation output needs to be encoded as\n       described.\n   5. \
    \ Replace each instance of private data with the corresponding\n       (possibly\
    \ encoded) transformation when generating the report.\n       Note that the replaced\
    \ text could also be in a context that has\n       constraints, such as length\
    \ limits that need to be observed.\n   This has the effect of obscuring the data\
    \ (in a potentially\n   irreversible way) while still allowing the report recipient\
    \ to\n   observe that numerous reports are about one particular end user.\n  \
    \ Such detection enables the receiver to prioritize its reactions based\n   on\
    \ problems that appear to be focused on specific end users that may\n   be under\
    \ attack.\n"
- title: 4.  Transformation Mechanisms
  contents:
  - "4.  Transformation Mechanisms\n   This memo does not specify a particular transformation\
    \ mechanism as a\n   requirement.  The interoperability that this memo seeks to\
    \ provide is\n   enabled by the consistency of the transformation.\n   Dealing\
    \ with the issue of the security of the transformation (i.e.,\n   frustrating\
    \ attempts to reverse the transformation) is a matter of\n   local policy.  A\
    \ continuum of possible transformations exists, from\n   trivial ones such as\
    \ rot13, CRC32, and base64, through strong\n   cryptographic encodings such as\
    \ the Hashed Message Authentication\n   Code [HMAC] and even full encryption,\
    \ or private transformations such\n   as mapping an email address to an internal\
    \ customer number.  An\n   operator wishing to perform report redaction needs\
    \ to select a\n   consistent transformation that obscures the private data and\
    \ is\n   resilient to attempts to extract the original data to the extent\n  \
    \ required by local policy, keeping in mind that the environment in\n   which\
    \ the transformation is operating is not a highly secure one.\n   See Section\
    \ 5.3 for further details of this issue.\n   An implementation MAY choose any\
    \ transformation that has a reasonably\n   low likelihood of collision.\n"

  contents:
  - "5.1.  General\n   General security issues with respect to these reports are found\n\
    \   in [ARF].\n"
- title: 5.2.  Digest Collisions
  contents:
  - "5.2.  Digest Collisions\n   Message digest collisions are a well-understood issue.\
    \  Their\n   application here involves a report receiver improperly concluding\n\
    \   that two pieces of redacted information were originally the same when\n  \
    \ in fact they are not.  This can lead to a denial of service, where\n   the inadvertently\
    \ improper application of complaint data causes\n   unjustified corrective action.\
    \  Such cases are sufficiently unlikely\n   as to be of little concern.\n"
- title: 5.3.  Information Not Redacted
  contents:
  - "5.3.  Information Not Redacted\n   Although the identity of the user causing\
    \ a report to be generated\n   can be obscured using this mechanism, other properties\
    \ of a message\n   (such as the Message-ID field) that are not redacted could\
    \ be used to\n   recover the original data by locating them in the message logs\
    \ of the\n   originating system or via other data correlation techniques.  It\
    \ is\n   incumbent on the report generator to anticipate and redact or\n   otherwise\
    \ obscure such data, or accept that such recovery is possible\n   even from the\
    \ very simplest kinds of feedback.\n   It is for this reason that the normative\
    \ portions of this memo do not\n   include stronger assertions about cryptography\
    \ used in the\n   transformation.  Given the ultimate recoverability of the redacted\n\
    \   information, the cryptographic strength of the transformation is not\n   a\
    \ critical security measure.\n   The process of redacting a feedback report satisfies\
    \ a privacy\n   requirement established by local policy, and is not meant to provide\n\
    \   strong security properties.\n   [FBL-BCP] and Section 8 of [ARF] discuss topics\
    \ related to\n   establishment of bilateral agreements between report producers\
    \ and\n   consumers.  The issues raised here are also things to be considered\n\
    \   when establishing such agreements.\n"
- title: 6.  Privacy Considerations
  contents:
  - "6.  Privacy Considerations\n   While the method of redaction described in this\
    \ document may reduce\n   the likelihood of some types of private data from leaking\
    \ between\n   ADministrative Management Domains (ADMDs), it is extremely unlikely\n\
    \   that report generation software could ever be created to recognize\n   all\
    \ of the different ways that private information could be expressed\n   through\
    \ human written language.  If further protections are required,\n   implementers\
    \ may wish to consider establishing some sort of out-of-\n   band arrangements\
    \ between the relevant entities, to contain private\n   data as much as possible.\n"

    \     To: bob@example.net\n     Subject: Make money fast!\n     Message-ID: <123456789@mailer.example.com>\n\

    \ really fast?  Check it out!\n     http://www.example.com/scam/0xd0d0cafe\n \
    \  On receipt, bob@example.net reports this message as abusive through\n   whatever\
    \ mechanism his mailbox provider has established.  This causes\n   an [ARF] message\
    \ to be generated.  However, example.net wishes to\n   obscure Bob's email address\
    \ lest it be relayed to the offending\n   agent, which could lead to more trouble\
    \ for Bob.\n   Thus, example.net plans to redact the local-part of the recipient\n\
    \   address in the To: field.  Local policy and security requirements\n   suggest\
    \ that the algorithm known as \"H\" (a hash of a key concatenated\n   with the\
    \ data to be obscured) using SHA1 is adequate.  It has thus\n   selected a redaction\
    \ key of \"potatoes\", and the private data in this\n   case is the string \"\
    bob\".  The concatenation of \"potatoesbob\" is\n   digested with SHA1 and then\
    \ base64-encoded to the string\n   \"rZ8cqXWGiKHzhz1MsFRGTysHia4=\".\n   Therefore,\
    \ when constructing the ARF message in response to Bob's\n   complaint, the following\

    \     From: alice@example.com\n     To: rZ8cqXWGiKHzhz1MsFRGTysHia4=@example.net\n\

    \  Note, however, that it is possible that the redacted information can\n   be\
    \ recovered by agents at example.com searching their logs for the\n   original\
    \ envelope associated with the message, by correlating with\n   the Message-ID\
