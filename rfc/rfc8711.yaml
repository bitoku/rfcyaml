  - "Abstract\n   The IETF Administrative Support Activity (IASA) was originally\n\
    \   established in 2005.  In the years since then, the needs of the IETF\n   evolved\
    \ in ways that required changes to its administrative\n   structure.  The purpose\
    \ of this RFC is to document and describe the\n   IETF Administrative Support\
    \ Activity, version 2.0 (IASA 2.0).  It\n   defines the roles and responsibilities\
    \ of the IETF Administration LLC\n   Board (IETF LLC Board), the IETF Executive\
    \ Director, and the Internet\n   Society in the fiscal and administrative support\
    \ of the IETF\n   standards process.  It also defines the membership and selection\n\
    \   rules for the IETF LLC Board.\n   This document obsoletes RFC 4071, RFC 4333,\

  - "1.  Introduction\n   The IETF Administrative Support Activity (IASA) was originally\n\
    \   established in 2005.  In the years since then, the needs of the IETF\n   evolved\
    \ in ways that required changes to its administrative\n   structure.  The purpose\
    \ of this document is to document and describe\n   the IASA 2.0 structure.\n \
    \  Under IASA 2.0, the work of the IETF's administrative and fundraising\n   tasks\
    \ is conducted by an administrative organization, the IETF\n   Administration\
    \ LLC (IETF LLC).  Under this structure, the IETF\n   Administrative Oversight\
    \ Committee (IAOC) is eliminated, and its\n   oversight and advising functions\
    \ transferred to the IETF LLC Board.\n   The IETF LLC provides the corporate legal\
    \ home for the IETF, the\n   Internet Architecture Board (IAB), and the Internet\
    \ Research Task\n   Force (IRTF), and financial support for the operation of the\
    \ RFC\n   Editor.\n   [IASA2RECS] discusses the challenges facing the original\
    \ IASA\n   structure as well as several options for reorganizing the IETF's\n\
    \   administration under different legal structures.  This document\n   outlines\
    \ how the chosen option is structured and describes how the\n   organization fits\
    \ together with existing and new IETF community\n   structures.\n   Under IASA\
    \ 2.0, most of the responsibilities that [RFC4071] assigned\n   to the IETF Administrative\
    \ Director (IAD) and the Internet Society\n   (ISOC) were transferred to the IETF\
    \ LLC and IETF Administration LLC\n   Executive Director (IETF Executive Director).\
    \  It is the job of the\n   IETF LLC to meet the administrative needs of the IETF\
    \ and to ensure\n   that the IETF LLC meets the needs of the IETF community.\n\
    \   Eliminating the IAOC meant that changes were required in how trustees\n  \
    \ could be appointed to the IETF Trust.  The details of how this is\n   done are\
    \ outside the scope of this document but are covered in\n   [RFC8714].\n   This\
    \ document obsoletes [RFC4071], which specified the original IASA,\n   [RFC4333],\
    \ which specified the selection guidelines and process for\n   IAOC members, and\
    \ [RFC7691], which specified terms for IAOC members.\n"
- title: 2.  Scope Limitation
  contents:
  - "2.  Scope Limitation\n   The document does not propose any changes related to\
    \ the standards\n   process as currently conducted by the Internet Engineering\
    \ Steering\n   Group (IESG) and Internet Architecture Board (IAB) (see BCP 9\n\
    \   [RFC2026] and BCP 39 [RFC2850]).  In addition, no changes are made to\n  \
    \ the appeals chain, the process for making and confirming IETF and IAB\n   appointments\
    \ (see BCP 10 [RFC8713]), the technical work of the\n   Internet Research Task\
    \ Force (IRTF) (see [RFC2014]), or to ISOC's\n   membership in or support of other\
    \ organizations.\n"
- title: 3.  LLC Agreement with the Internet Society
  contents:
  - "3.  LLC Agreement with the Internet Society\n   The LLC Agreement between the\
    \ IETF LLC and ISOC is available at\n   [IETF-LLC-A].  This IASA 2.0 structure,\
    \ and thus this document,\n   depends on the LLC Agreement and will refer to it\
    \ to help explain\n   certain aspects of the legal relationship between the IETF\
    \ LLC and\n   ISOC.\n   The LLC Agreement was developed between legal representatives\
    \ of the\n   IETF and ISOC and includes all critical terms of the relationship,\n\
    \   while still enabling maximum unilateral flexibility for the IETF LLC\n   Board.\
    \  The LLC Agreement includes only basic details about how the\n   Board manages\
    \ itself or manages IETF LLC staff, so that the Board has\n   flexibility to make\
    \ changes without amending the agreement.  The\n   Board can independently develop\
    \ policy or procedures documents that\n   fill gaps.\n"

  contents:
  - "4.1.  Terminology\n   Although most of the terms, abbreviations, and acronyms\
    \ used in this\n   document are reasonably well known, first-time readers may\
    \ find some\n   terminology confusing.  This section therefore attempts to provide\
    \ a\n   quick summary.\n   IAB:  Internet Architecture Board (see [RFC2026] and\
    \ [RFC2850]).\n   IAD:  IETF Administrative Director, a role obsoleted by this\
    \ document\n      and the ISOC / IETF LLC Agreement (see [IETF-LLC-A]) and replaced\n\
    \      by the IETF LLC Executive Director.\n   IAOC:  IETF Administrative Oversight\
    \ Committee, a committee that\n      oversaw IETF administrative activity.  The\
    \ IAOC is obsoleted by\n      this document and replaced by the IETF LLC Board.\
    \  The IETF Trust\n      was formerly populated by IAOC members.  Its membership\
    \ is now\n      distinct from that of the IETF LLC Board (see [RFC8714]).\n  \
    \ IASA:  The IETF Administrative Support Activity, consists of the IETF\n    \
    \  LLC Board, employees, and contractors.  Uses of the term 'IASA' as\n      a\
    \ proper noun may imply a subset of these roles, or all of them.\n   IASA 2.0:\
    \  The IETF Administrative Support Activity, version 2.0\n      (defined by this\
    \ document).\n   IESG:  Internet Engineering Steering Group (see [RFC2026] and\n\

    \ a corporate legal framework for facilitating current and\n      future activities\
    \ related to the IETF, IAB, and IRTF.  It was\n      established by the ISOC /\
    \ IETF LLC Agreement (see [IETF-LLC-A])\n      and is referred to as \"IETF LLC\"\
    .\n   IETF LLC Executive Director:  the Executive Director for the IETF\n    \
    \  LLC, responsible for day-to-day administrative and operational\n      direction\
    \ (see Section 5.1).  Also referred to as \"IETF Executive\n      Director\".\n\
    \   IETF LLC Board:  The Board of Directors of the IETF LLC.  The IETF\n     \
    \ LLC Board is formally a multi-member \"manager\" of the IETF LLC on\n      behalf\
    \ of ISOC (see Section 5.2).\n   ISOC:  Internet Society (see [RFC8712] and [ISOC]).\n"

  contents:
  - "4.3.  General IETF LLC Responsibilities\n   The IETF LLC is established to provide\
    \ administrative support to the\n   IETF.  It has no authority over the standards\
    \ development activities\n   of the IETF.\n   The responsibilities of the IETF\
    \ LLC are:\n   *  Operations.  The IETF LLC is responsible for supporting the\n\
    \      ongoing operations of the IETF, including meetings and non-meeting\n  \
    \    activities.\n   *  Finances.  The IETF LLC is responsible for managing the\
    \ IETF's\n      finances and budget.\n   *  Fundraising.  The IETF LLC is responsible\
    \ for raising money on\n      behalf of the IETF.\n   *  Compliance.  The IETF\
    \ LLC is responsible for establishing and\n      enforcing policies to ensure\
    \ compliance with applicable laws,\n      regulations, and rules.\n   The manner\
    \ by which these responsibilities under the IETF LLC are\n   organized is intended\
    \ to address the problems described in Sections\n   3.1.1, 3.1.2, and 3.1.3 of\
    \ [IASA2RECS].  Specifically, this is\n   intended to bring greater clarity around\
    \ roles, responsibilities,\n   representation, decision-making, and authority.\n\
    \   In addition, by having the IETF LLC manage the IETF's finances and\n   conduct\
    \ the IETF's fundraising, confusion about who is responsible\n   for representing\
    \ the IETF to sponsors and who directs the uses of\n   sponsorship funds should\
    \ be eliminated.  Finally, having the IETF LLC\n   reside in a defined, distinct\
    \ legal entity, and taking responsibility\n   for operations, enables the organization\
    \ to execute its own contracts\n   without the need for review and approval by\
    \ ISOC.\n"
- title: 4.4.  IETF LLC Working Principles
  contents:
  - "4.4.  IETF LLC Working Principles\n   The IETF LLC is expected to conduct its\
    \ work according to the\n   following principles:\n   *  Transparency.  The IETF\
    \ LLC is expected to keep the IETF community\n      informed about its work, subject\
    \ to reasonable confidentiality\n      concerns, and to engage with the community\
    \ to obtain consensus-\n      based community input on key issues and otherwise\
    \ as needed.  The\n      IETF community expects complete visibility into the financial\
    \ and\n      legal structure of the IETF LLC.  This includes information about\n\
    \      the IETF LLC annual budget and associated regular financial\n      reports,\
    \ results of financial and any other independent audits,\n      tax filings, significant\
    \ contracts, or other significant long-term\n      financial commitments that\
    \ bind the IETF LLC.  Whatever doesn't\n      have a specific justification for\
    \ being kept confidential is\n      expected to be made public.  The Board is\
    \ expected to develop and\n      maintain a public list of confidential items,\
    \ describing the\n      nature of the information and the reason for confidentiality.\
    \  The\n      Board will also publish its operating procedures.\n   *  Responsiveness\
    \ to the community.  The IETF LLC is expected to act\n      consistently with\
    \ the documented consensus of the IETF community,\n      to be responsive to the\
    \ community's needs, and to adapt its\n      decisions in response to consensus-based\
    \ community feedback.\n   *  Diligence.  The IETF LLC is expected to act responsibly\
    \ so as to\n      minimize risks to IETF participants and to the future of the\
    \ IETF\n      as a whole, such as financial risks.\n   *  Unification: The IETF\
    \ LLC provides the corporate legal home for\n      the IETF, the Internet Architecture\
    \ Board (IAB), and the Internet\n      Research Task Force (IRTF), and financial\
    \ support for the\n      operation of the RFC Editor.\n   *  Transfer or Dissolution:\
    \ Consistent with [IETF-LLC-A], the IETF\n      LLC subsidiary may be transferred\
    \ from ISOC to another\n      organization, at the request of either party.  Similarly,\
    \ the IETF\n      LLC may be dissolved if necessary.  Should either event occur,\
    \ the\n      IETF community should be closely involved in any decisions and\n\
    \      plans.  Any transfer, transition, or dissolution should be\n      conducted\
    \ carefully and with minimal potential disruption to the\n      IETF.\n   The\
    \ transparency and responsiveness principles are designed to\n   address the concern\
    \ outlined in Section 3.3 of [IASA2RECS] about the\n   need for improved timeliness\
    \ of sharing of information and decisions\n   and seeking community comments.\
    \  The issue of increased transparency\n   was important throughout the IASA 2.0\
    \ process, with little to no\n   dissent.  It was recognized that there will naturally\
    \ be\n   confidentiality requirements about some aspects of contracting,\n   personnel\
    \ matters, and other narrow areas.\n"

- title: 5.1.  IETF Executive Director and Staff Responsibilities
  contents:
  - "5.1.  IETF Executive Director and Staff Responsibilities\n   The IETF LLC is\
    \ led by an IETF Executive Director chosen by the\n   Board.  The IETF Executive\
    \ Director is responsible for managing the\n   day-to-day operations of the IETF\
    \ LLC, including hiring staff to\n   perform various operational functions.  The\
    \ IETF Executive Director\n   and any staff may be employees or independent contractors.\n\
    \   Allowing for the division of responsibilities among multiple staff\n   members\
    \ and contractors is designed to address some of the concerns\n   raised in Section\
    \ 3.2 (Lack of Resources) and Section 3.4 (Funding/\n   Operating Model Mismatch\
    \ and Rising Costs) of [IASA2RECS].\n   Based on the amount of work previously\
    \ undertaken by the IAD and\n   others involved in the IETF administration, the\
    \ design of the IETF\n   LLC anticipated that the IETF Executive Director may\
    \ need to hire\n   multiple additional staff members.  For example, resources\
    \ to manage\n   fundraising, to manage the various contractors that are engaged\
    \ to\n   fulfill the IETF's administrative needs, and to support outreach and\n\
    \   communications were envisioned.\n   The IETF has historically benefited from\
    \ the use of contractors for\n   accounting, finance, meeting planning, administrative\
    \ assistance,\n   legal counsel, tools, and web site support, as well as other\
    \ services\n   related to the standards process (e.g., RFC Editor and IANA). \
    \ Prior\n   to making the transition from IASA to IASA 2.0, the IETF budget\n\
    \   reflected specific support from ISOC for communications and\n   fundraising\
    \ as well as some general support for accounting, finance,\n   legal, and other\
    \ services.  The division of responsibilities between\n   staff and contractors\
    \ is at the discretion of the IETF Executive\n   Director and their staff.\n \
    \  The IETF has a long history of community involvement in the execution\n   of\
    \ certain administrative functions, in particular development of\n   IETF tools,\
    \ the operation of the meeting network by the Network\n   Operations Center (NOC),\
    \ and some outreach and communications\n   activities conducted by the Education\
    \ and Mentoring Directorate.  The\n   IETF LLC staff is expected to respect the\
    \ IETF community's wishes\n   about community involvement in these and other functions\
    \ going\n   forward as long as the staff feels that they can meet the otherwise-\n\
    \   stated needs of the community.  Establishing the framework to allow\n   the\
    \ IETF LLC to staff each administrative function as appropriate may\n   require\
    \ the IETF community to document its consensus expectations in\n   areas where\
    \ no documentation currently exists.\n   In summary, the IETF Executive Director,\
    \ with support from the team\n   that they alone direct and lead, is responsible\
    \ for:\n   *  Developing and refining an annual budget and other strategic\n \
    \     financial planning documents at the direction of the Board.\n   *  Executing\
    \ on the annual budget, including reporting to the Board\n      regularly with\
    \ forecasts and actual performance to budget.\n   *  Hiring and/or contracting\
    \ the necessary resources to meet their\n      goals, within the defined limits\
    \ of the IETF Executive Director's\n      authority and within the approved budget.\

    \ binding\n   responsibilities are defined in the LLC Agreement [IETF-LLC-A] and\n\
    \   applicable law.  If there are unintentional differences or other\n   confusion,\
    \ the LLC Agreement and applicable law are authoritative.\n   Board members have\
    \ fiduciary obligations imposed by the LLC Agreement\n   and applicable law, including\
    \ duties of loyalty, care, and good\n   faith.  The Board is responsible for setting\
    \ broad strategic\n   direction for the LLC, adopting an annual budget, hiring\
    \ or\n   terminating an IETF Executive Director (or amending the terms of\n  \
    \ their engagement), adopting any employee benefit plans, consulting\n   the relevant\
    \ IETF communities on matters related to the LLC as\n   appropriate, approving\
    \ any changes to the LLC governance structure,\n   incurring any debt, and approving\
    \ entering into agreements that meet\n   a significant materiality threshold to\

    \ community with an opportunity to\n   review and discuss any proposed changes\
    \ to the IETF LLC structure\n   prior to their adoption.\n   The role of the Board\
    \ is to ensure that the strategy and conduct of\n   the IETF LLC is consistent\
    \ with the IETF's needs -- both its concrete\n   needs and its needs for transparency\
    \ and accountability.  The Board\n   is not intended to directly define the IETF's\

- title: 5.3.  Board Design Goals
  contents:
  - "5.3.  Board Design Goals\n   A goal of this Board composition is to balance the\
    \ need for the IETF\n   LLC to be accountable to the IETF community with the need\
    \ for this\n   Board to have the expertise necessary to oversee a small non-profit\n\
    \   company.  The Board is smaller than the previous IAOC and the other\n   leadership\
    \ bodies of the IETF, in part to keep the Board focused on\n   its rather limited\
    \ set of strategic responsibilities as noted in\n   Section 5.2.\n   This board\
    \ structure, with limited strategic responsibilities noted\n   in Section 5.2\
    \ and limited size, together with the staff\n   responsibilities noted in Section\
    \ 5.1, is designed to overcome the\n   challenges described in Section 3.1.4 of\
    \ [IASA2RECS] concerning\n   oversight.  This establishes a clear line of oversight\
    \ over staff\n   performance: the IETF LLC Board oversees the IETF Executive\n\
    \   Director's performance and has actual legal authority to remove a\n   non-performing\
    \ IETF Executive Director.  The IETF Executive Director\n   is responsible for\
    \ the day-to-day operation of the IETF LLC.\n   Finally, the Board is expected\
    \ to operate transparently, to further\n   address the concern raised in Section\
    \ 3.3 of [IASA2RECS].  The\n   default transparency rule arrived at during the\
    \ IASA 2.0 design\n   process is detailed in Section 4.4.  The Board will need\
    \ to establish\n   how it will meet that commitment.\n"

    \     applies regardless of whether the appointed individual is on the\n     \
    \ IESG, rotates off the IESG during the two-year term, or is not on\n      the\
    \ IESG.  This makes the term length for this slot the same as\n      the term\
    \ lengths established in [RFC8713], Section 3.4.\n"
- title: 6.5.  IETF LLC Board Director Limit
  contents:
  - "6.5.  IETF LLC Board Director Limit\n   A director may serve no more than two\
    \ consecutive terms.  A director\n   cannot serve a third term until three years\
    \ have passed since their\n   second consecutive term.  An exception is if a Director\
    \ role is\n   occupied by the IETF Chair ex officio, since that person's service\
    \ is\n   governed instead by the term lengths established in [RFC8713],\n   Section\
    \ 3.4.\n   The term limits specified above apply to an individual, even if that\n\
    \   individual is appointed in different ways over time.  For example, an\n  \
    \ individual appointed to two terms by the ISOC Board of Trustees may\n   not\
    \ immediately be appointed to a third term by the IETF NomCom.  A\n   Director\
    \ appointed by the IETF LLC itself may only serve for one term\n   by that appointment\
    \ method, and any subsequent terms would have to be\n   via other methods; in\
    \ any case, the term limits above apply to that\n   individual.\n   Lastly, partial\
    \ terms of less than three years for the initial\n   appointments to the first\
    \ full Board, for which some Directors will\n   have terms of one or two years,\
    \ do not count against the term limit.\n   The limit on consecutive terms supports\
    \ the healthy regular\n   introduction of new ideas and energy into the Board\
    \ and mitigates\n   potential long-term risk of ossification or conflict, without\n\
    \   adversely impacting the potential pool of director candidates over\n   time.\n"
