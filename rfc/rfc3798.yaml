  - "Abstract\n   This memo defines a MIME content-type that may be used by a mail\
    \ user\n   agent (MUA) or electronic mail gateway to report the disposition of\
    \ a\n   message after it has been successfully delivered to a recipient.\n   This\
    \ content-type is intended to be machine-processable.  Additional\n   message\
    \ headers are also defined to permit Message Disposition\n   Notifications (MDNs)\
    \ to be requested by the sender of a message.  The\n   purpose is to extend Internet\
    \ Mail to support functionality often\n   found in other messaging systems, such\
    \ as X.400 and the proprietary\n   \"LAN-based\" systems, and often referred to\
    \ as \"read receipts,\"\n   \"acknowledgements\", or \"receipt notifications.\"\
    \  The intention is to\n   do this while respecting privacy concerns, which have\
    \ often been\n   expressed when such functions have been discussed in the past.\n\
    \   Because many messages are sent between the Internet and other\n   messaging\
    \ systems (such as X.400 or the proprietary \"LAN-based\"\n   systems), the MDN\
    \ protocol is designed to be useful in a multi-\n   protocol messaging environment.\
    \  To this end, the protocol described\n   in this memo provides for the carriage\
    \ of \"foreign\" addresses, in\n   addition to those normally used in Internet\
    \ Mail.  Additional\n   attributes may also be defined to support \"tunneling\"\
    \ of foreign\n   notifications through Internet Mail.\n"

- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   This memo defines a [RFC-MIME-MEDIA] content-type for message\n\
    \   disposition notifications (MDNs).  An MDN can be used to notify the\n   sender\
    \ of a message of any of several conditions that may occur after\n   successful\
    \ delivery, such as display of the message contents,\n   printing of the message,\
    \ deletion (without display) of the message,\n   or the recipient's refusal to\
    \ provide MDNs.  The\n   \"message/disposition-notification\" content-type defined\
    \ herein is\n   intended for use within the framework of the \"multipart/report\"\
    \n   content type defined in [RFC-REPORT].\n   This memo defines the format of\
    \ the notifications and the [RFC-\n   MSGFMT] headers used to request them.\n"
- title: 1.1.  Purposes
  contents:
  - "1.1.  Purposes\n   The MDNs defined in this memo are expected to serve several\
    \ purposes:\n   (a)  Inform human beings of the disposition of messages after\n\
    \        successful delivery, in a manner that is largely independent of\n   \
    \     human language;\n   (b)  Allow mail user agents to keep track of the disposition\
    \ of\n        messages sent, by associating returned MDNs with earlier message\n\
    \        transmissions;\n   (c)  Convey disposition notification requests and\
    \ disposition\n        notifications between Internet Mail and \"foreign\" mail\
    \ systems\n        via a gateway;\n   (d)  Allow \"foreign\" notifications to\
    \ be tunneled through a MIME-\n        capable message system and back into the\
    \ original messaging\n        system that issued the original notification, or\
    \ even to a third\n        messaging system;\n   (e)  Allow language-independent,\
    \ yet reasonably precise, indications\n        of the disposition of a message\
    \ to be delivered.\n"
- title: 1.2.  Requirements
  contents:
  - "1.2.  Requirements\n   These purposes place the following constraints on the\
    \ notification\n   protocol:\n   (a)  It must be readable by humans, and must\
    \ be machine-parsable.\n   (b)  It must provide enough information to allow message\
    \ senders (or\n        their user agents) to unambiguously associate an MDN with\
    \ the\n        message that was sent and the original recipient address for\n\
    \        which the MDN was issued (if such information is available),\n      \
    \  even if the message was forwarded to another recipient address.\n   (c)  It\
    \ must also be able to describe the disposition of a message\n        independent\
    \ of any particular human language or of the\n        terminology of any particular\
    \ mail system.\n   (d)  The specification must be extensible in order to accommodate\n\
    \        future requirements.\n"
- title: 1.3.  Terminology
  contents:
  - "1.3.  Terminology\n   The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"\
    SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\"\
    , and \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n   document are to be interpreted as described in\
    \ [RFC-KEYWORDS].\n   All syntax descriptions use the ABNF specified by [RFC-MSGFMT],\
    \ in\n   which the lexical tokens (used below) are defined: \"atom\", \"CRLF\"\
    ,\n   \"mailbox\", \"msg-id\", and \"text\".  The following lexical tokens are\n\
    \   defined in the definition of the Content-Type header in [RFC-MIME-\n   BODY]:\
    \ \"attribute\" and \"value\".\n"
- title: 2.  Requesting Message Disposition Notifications
  contents:
  - "2.  Requesting Message Disposition Notifications\n   Message disposition notifications\
    \ are requested by including a\n   Disposition-Notification-To header in the message.\
    \  Further\n   information to be used by the recipient's MUA in generating the\
    \ MDN\n   may be provided by also including Original-Recipient and/or\n   Disposition-Notification-Options\
    \ headers in the message.\n"
- title: 2.1.  The Disposition-Notification-To Header
  contents:
  - "2.1.  The Disposition-Notification-To Header\n   A request for the receiving\
    \ user agent to issue message disposition\n   notifications is made by placing\
    \ a Disposition-Notification-To header\n   into the message.  The syntax of the\
    \ header is\n   mdn-request-header = \"Disposition-Notification-To\" \":\"\n \
    \            mailbox *(\",\" mailbox)\n   The presence of a Disposition-Notification-To\
    \ header in a message is\n   merely a request for an MDN.  The recipients' user\
    \ agents are always\n   free to silently ignore such a request.  Alternatively,\
    \ an explicit\n   denial of the request for information about the disposition\
    \ of the\n   message may be sent using the \"denied\" disposition in an MDN.\n\
    \   An MDN MUST NOT itself have a Disposition-Notification-To header.  An\n  \
    \ MDN MUST NOT be generated in response to an MDN.\n   A user agent MUST NOT issue\
    \ more than one MDN on behalf of each\n   particular recipient.  That is, once\
    \ an MDN has been issued on behalf\n   of a recipient, no further MDNs may be\
    \ issued on behalf of that\n   recipient, even if another disposition is performed\
    \ on the message.\n   However, if a message is forwarded, an MDN may have been\
    \ issued for\n   the recipient doing the forwarding and the recipient of the forwarded\n\
    \   message may also cause an MDN to be generated.\n   While Internet standards\
    \ normally do not specify the behavior of user\n   interfaces, it is strongly\
    \ recommended that the user agent obtain the\n   user's consent before sending\
    \ an MDN.  This consent could be obtained\n   for each message through some sort\
    \ of prompt or dialog box, or\n   globally through the user's setting of a preference.\
    \  The user might\n   also indicate globally that MDNs are to never be sent or\
    \ that a\n   \"denied\" MDN is always sent in response to a request for an MDN.\n\
    \   MDNs SHOULD NOT be sent automatically if the address in the\n   Disposition-Notification-To\
    \ header differs from the address in the\n   Return-Path header (see [RFC-MSGFMT]).\
    \  In this case, confirmation\n   from the user SHOULD be obtained, if possible.\
    \  If obtaining consent\n   is not possible (e.g., because the user is not online\
    \ at the time),\n   then an MDN SHOULD NOT be sent.\n   Confirmation from the\
    \ user SHOULD be obtained (or no MDN sent) if\n   there is no Return-Path header\
    \ in the message, or if there is more\n   than one distinct address in the Disposition-Notification-To\
    \ header.\n   The comparison of the addresses should be done using only the addr-\n\
    \   spec (local-part \"@\" domain) portion, excluding any phrase and route.\n\
    \   The comparison MUST be case-sensitive for the local-part and case-\n   insensitive\
    \ for the domain part.\n   If the message contains more than one Return-Path header,\
    \ the\n   implementation may pick one to use for the comparison, or treat the\n\
    \   situation as a failure of the comparison.\n   The reason for not automatically\
    \ sending an MDN if the comparison\n   fails or more than one address is specified\
    \ is to reduce the\n   possibility of mail loops and of MDNs being used for mail\
    \ bombing.\n   A message that contains a Disposition-Notification-To header SHOULD\n\
    \   also contain a Message-ID header as specified in [RFC-MSGFMT].  This\n   will\
    \ permit automatic correlation of MDNs with their original\n   messages by user\
    \ agents.\n   If the request for message disposition notifications for some\n\
    \   recipients and not others is desired, two copies of the message\n   should\
    \ be sent, one with a Disposition-Notification-To header and one\n   without.\
    \  Many of the other headers of the message (e.g., To, Cc)\n   will be the same\
    \ in both copies.  The recipients in the respective\n   message envelopes determine\
    \ for whom message disposition\n   notifications are requested and for whom they\
    \ are not.  If desired,\n   the Message-ID header may be the same in both copies\
    \ of the message.\n   Note that there are other situations (e.g., Bcc) in which\
    \ it is\n   necessary to send multiple copies of a message with slightly\n   different\
    \ headers.  The combination of such situations and the need\n   to request MDNs\
    \ for a subset of all recipients may result in more\n   than two copies of a message\
    \ being sent, some with a Disposition-\n   Notification-To header and some without.\n\
    \   Messages posted to newsgroups SHOULD NOT have a Disposition-\n   Notification-To\
    \ header.\n"
- title: 2.2.  The Disposition-Notification-Options Header
  contents:
  - "2.2.  The Disposition-Notification-Options Header\n   Future extensions to this\
    \ specification may require that information\n   be supplied to the recipient's\
    \ MUA for additional control over how\n   and what MDNs are generated.  The Disposition-Notification-Options\n\
    \   header provides an extensible mechanism for such information.  The\n   syntax\
    \ of this header is as follows:\n   Disposition-Notification-Options =\n     \
    \        \"Disposition-Notification-Options\" \":\"\n                        \
    \    disposition-notification-parameters\n   disposition-notification-parameters\
    \ = parameter *(\";\" parameter)\n   parameter = attribute \"=\" importance \"\
    ,\" value *(\",\" value)\n   importance = \"required\" / \"optional\"\n   An importance\
    \ of \"required\" indicates that interpretation of the\n   parameter is necessary\
    \ for proper generation of an MDN in response to\n   this request.  If an MUA\
    \ does not understand the meaning of the\n   parameter, it MUST NOT generate an\
    \ MDN with any disposition type\n   other than \"failed\" in response to the request.\
    \  An importance of\n   \"optional\" indicates that an MUA that does not understand\
    \ the meaning\n   of this parameter MAY generate an MDN in response anyway, ignoring\n\
    \   the value of the parameter.\n   No parameters are defined in this specification.\
    \  Parameters may be\n   defined in the future by later revisions or extensions\
    \ to this\n   specification.  Parameter attribute names beginning with \"X-\"\
    \ will\n   never be defined as standard names; such names are reserved for\n \
    \  experimental use.  MDN parameter names not beginning with \"X-\" MUST\n   be\
    \ registered with the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) and\n   described\
    \ in a standards-track RFC or an experimental RFC approved by\n   the IESG.  (See\
    \ Section 10 for a registration form.)\n   If a required parameter is not understood\
    \ or contains some sort of\n   error, the receiving MUA SHOULD issue an MDN with\
    \ a disposition type\n   of \"failed\" (see Section 3.2.6), and include a Failure\
    \ field (see\n   Section 3.2.7) that further describes the problem.  MDNs with\
    \ the\n   disposition type of \"failed\" and a \"Failure\" field MAY also be\n\
    \   generated when other types of errors are detected in the parameters\n   of\
    \ the Disposition-Notification-Options header.\n   However, an MDN with a disposition\
    \ type of \"failed\" MUST NOT be\n   generated if the user has indicated a preference\
    \ that MDNs are not to\n   be sent.  If user consent would be required for an\
    \ MDN of some other\n   disposition type to be sent, user consent SHOULD also\
    \ be obtained\n   before sending an MDN with a disposition type of \"failed\"\
    .\n"
- title: 2.3.  The Original-Recipient Header
  contents:
  - "2.3.  The Original-Recipient Header\n   Since electronic mail addresses may be\
    \ rewritten while the message is\n   in transit, it is useful for the original\
    \ recipient address to be\n   made available by the delivering MTA.  The delivering\
    \ MTA may be able\n   to obtain this information from the ORCPT parameter of the\
    \ SMTP RCPT\n   TO command, as defined in [RFC-SMTP] and [RFC-DSN-SMTP].\n   [RFC-DSN-SMTP]\
    \ is amended as follows: If the ORCPT information is\n   available, the delivering\
    \ MTA SHOULD insert an Original-Recipient\n   header at the beginning of the message\
    \ (along with the Return-Path\n   header).  The delivering MTA MAY delete any\
    \ other Original-Recipient\n   headers that occur in the message.  The syntax\
    \ of this header is as\n   follows:\n   original-recipient-header =\n        \
    \       \"Original-Recipient\" \":\" address-type \";\" generic-address\n   The\
    \ address-type and generic-address token are as specified in the\n   description\
    \ of the Original-Recipient field in section 3.2.3.\n   The purpose of carrying\
    \ the original recipient information and\n   returning it in the MDN is to permit\
    \ automatic correlation of MDNs\n   with the original message on a per-recipient\
    \ basis.\n"
- title: 2.4.  Use with the Message/Partial Content Type
  contents:
  - "2.4.  Use with the Message/Partial Content Type\n   The use of the headers Disposition-Notification-To,\
    \ Disposition-\n   Notification-Options, and Original-Recipient with the MIME\n\
    \   message/partial content type ([RFC-MIME-MEDIA]) requires further\n   definition.\n\
    \   When a message is segmented into two or more message/partial\n   fragments,\
    \ the three headers mentioned in the above paragraph SHOULD\n   be placed in the\
    \ \"inner\" or \"enclosed\" message (using the terms of\n   [RFC-MIME-MEDIA]).\

- title: 3.  Format of a Message Disposition Notification
  contents:
  - "3.  Format of a Message Disposition Notification\n   A message disposition notification\
    \ is a MIME message with a top-level\n   content-type of multipart/report (defined\
    \ in [RFC-REPORT]).  When\n   multipart/report content is used to transmit an\
    \ MDN:\n   (a)  The report-type parameter of the multipart/report content is\n\
    \        \"disposition-notification\".\n   (b)  The first component of the multipart/report\
    \ contains a human-\n        readable explanation of the MDN, as described in\
    \ [RFC-REPORT].\n   (c)  The second component of the multipart/report is of content-type\n\
    \        message/disposition-notification, described in section 3.1 of\n     \
    \   this document.\n   (d)  If the original message or a portion of the message\
    \ is to be\n        returned to the sender, it appears as the third component\
    \ of the\n        multipart/report.  The decision of whether or not to return\
    \ the\n        message or part of the message is up to the MUA generating the\n\
    \        MDN.  However, in the case of encrypted messages requesting\n       \
    \ MDNs, encrypted message text MUST be returned, if it is returned\n        at\
    \ all, only in its original encrypted form.\n    NOTE:  For message disposition\
    \ notifications gatewayed from foreign\n    systems, the headers of the original\
    \ message may not be available.\n    In this case, the third component of the\
    \ MDN may be omitted, or it\n    may contain \"simulated\" [RFC-MSGFMT] headers\
    \ that contain equivalent\n    information.  In particular, it is very desirable\
    \ to preserve the\n    subject and date fields from the original message.\n  \
    \ The MDN MUST be addressed (in both the message header and the\n   transport\
    \ envelope) to the address(es) from the Disposition-\n   Notification-To header\
    \ from the original message for which the MDN is\n   being generated.\n   The\
    \ From field of the message header of the MDN MUST contain the\n   address of\
    \ the person for whom the message disposition notification\n   is being issued.\n\
    \   The envelope sender address (i.e., SMTP MAIL FROM) of the MDN MUST be\n  \
    \ null (<>), specifying that no Delivery Status Notification messages\n   or other\
    \ messages indicating successful or unsuccessful delivery are\n   to be sent in\
    \ response to an MDN.\n   A message disposition notification MUST NOT itself request\
    \ an MDN.\n   That is, it MUST NOT contain a Disposition-Notification-To header.\n\
    \   The Message-ID header (if present) for an MDN MUST be different from\n   the\
    \ Message-ID of the message for which the MDN is being issued.\n   A particular\
    \ MDN describes the disposition of exactly one message for\n   exactly one recipient.\
    \  Multiple MDNs may be generated as a result of\n   one message submission, one\
    \ per recipient.  However, due to the\n   circumstances described in Section 2.1,\
    \ MDNs may not be generated for\n   some recipients for which MDNs were requested.\n"

    \ and comments\n   apply. Notification fields may be continued onto multiple lines\
    \ by\n   beginning each additional line with a SPACE or HTAB.  Text that\n   appears\
    \ in parentheses is considered a comment and not part of the\n   contents of that\
    \ notification field.  Field names are case-\n   insensitive, so the names of\
    \ notification fields may be spelled in\n   any combination of upper and lower\
    \ case letters.  Comments in\n   notification fields may use the \"encoded-word\"\

- title: 3.1.2.  "*-type" subfields
  contents:
  - "3.1.2.  \"*-type\" subfields\n   Several fields consist of a \"-type\" subfield,\
    \ followed by a semi-\n   colon, followed by \"*text\".  For these fields, the\
    \ keyword used in\n   the address-type or MTA-type subfield indicates the expected\
    \ format\n   of the address or MTA-name that follows.\n   The \"-type\" subfields\
    \ are defined as follows:\n   (a)  An \"address-type\" specifies the format of\
    \ a mailbox address.\n        For example, Internet Mail addresses use the \"\
    rfc822\" address-\n        type.\n        address-type = atom\n   (b)  An \"MTA-name-type\"\
    \ specifies the format of a mail transfer agent\n        name.  For example, for\
    \ an SMTP server on an Internet host, the\n        MTA name is the domain name\
    \ of that host, and the \"dns\" MTA-\n        name-type is used.\n        mta-name-type\
    \ = atom\n   Values for address-type and mta-name-type are case-insensitive.\n\
    \   Thus, address-type values of \"RFC822\" and \"rfc822\" are equivalent.\n \
    \  The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) maintains a registry\n   of\
    \ address-type and mta-name-type values, along with descriptions of\n   the meanings\
    \ of each, or a reference to one or more specifications\n   that provide such\
    \ descriptions.  (The \"rfc822\" address-type is\n   defined in [RFC-DSN-SMTP].)\
    \  Registration forms for address-type and\n   mta-name-type appear in [RFC-DSN-FORMAT].\n"

- title: 5.  Conformance and Usage Requirements
  contents:
  - "5.  Conformance and Usage Requirements\n   An MUA or gateway conforms to this\
    \ specification if it generates MDNs\n   according to the protocol defined in\
    \ this memo.  It is not necessary\n   to be able to generate all of the possible\
    \ values of the Disposition\n   field.\n   MUAs and gateways MUST NOT generate\
    \ the Original-Recipient field of\n   an MDN unless the mail protocols provide\
    \ the address originally\n   specified by the sender at the time of submission.\
    \  Ordinary SMTP\n   does not make that guarantee, but the SMTP extension defined\
    \ in\n   [RFC-DSN-SMTP] permits such information to be carried in the envelope\n\
    \   if it is available.  The Original-Recipient header defined in this\n   document\
    \ provides a way for the MTA to pass the original recipient\n   address to the\
    \ MUA.\n   Each sender-specified recipient address may result in more than one\n\
    \   MDN.  If an MDN is requested for a recipient that is forwarded to\n   multiple\
    \ recipients of an \"alias\" (as defined in [RFC-DSN-SMTP],\n   section 6.2.7.3),\
    \ each of the recipients may issue an MDN.\n   Successful distribution of a message\
    \ to a mailing list exploder\n   SHOULD be considered the final disposition of\
    \ the message.  A mailing\n   list exploder MAY issue an MDN with a disposition\
    \ type of \"processed\"\n   and disposition modes of \"automatic-action\" and\
    \ \"MDN-sent-\n   automatically\" indicating that the message has been forwarded\
    \ to the\n   list.  In this case, the request for MDNs is not propagated to the\n\
    \   members of the list.\n   Alternatively, the mailing list exploder MAY issue\
    \ no MDN and\n   propagate the request for MDNs to all members of the list.  The\n\
    \   latter behavior is not recommended for any but small, closely knit\n   lists,\
    \ as it might cause large numbers of MDNs to be generated and\n   may cause confidential\
    \ subscribers to the list to be revealed.  The\n   mailing list exploder MAY also\
    \ direct MDNs to itself, correlate them,\n   and produce a report to the original\
    \ sender of the message.\n   This specification places no restrictions on the\
    \ processing of MDNs\n   received by user agents or mailing lists.\n"

  - "6.2.  Privacy\n   Another dimension of security is privacy.  There may be cases\
    \ in\n   which a message recipient does not wish the disposition of messages\n\
    \   addressed to him to be known, or is concerned that the sending of\n   MDNs\
    \ may reveal other sensitive information (e.g., when the message\n   was read).\
    \  In this situation, it is acceptable for the MUA to issue\n   \"denied\" MDNs\
    \ or to silently ignore requests for MDNs.\n   If the Disposition-Notification-To\
    \ header is passed on unmodified\n   when a message is distributed to the subscribers\
    \ of a mailing list,\n   the subscribers to the list may be revealed to the sender\
    \ of the\n   original message by the generation of MDNs.\n   Headers of the original\
    \ message returned in part 3 of the\n   multipart/report could reveal confidential\
    \ information about host\n   names and/or network topology inside a firewall.\n\
    \   An unencrypted MDN could reveal confidential information about an\n   encrypted\
    \ message, especially if all or part of the original message\n   is returned in\
    \ part 3 of the multipart/report.  Encrypted MDNs are\n   not defined in this\
    \ specification.\n   In general, any optional MDN field may be omitted if the\
    \ Reporting\n   MUA site or user determines that inclusion of the field would\
    \ impose\n   too great a compromise of site confidentiality.  The need for such\n\
    \   confidentiality must be balanced against the utility of the omitted\n   information\
    \ in MDNs.\n   In some cases, someone with access to the message stream may use\
    \ the\n   MDN request mechanism to monitor the mail reading habits of a target.\n\
    \   If the target is known to generate MDN reports, they could add a\n   disposition-notification-to\
    \ field containing the envelope from\n   address along with a source route.  The\
    \ source route is ignored in\n   the comparison so the addresses will always match.\
    \  But if the source\n   route is honored when the notification is sent, it could\
    \ direct the\n   message to some other destination.  This risk can be minimized\
    \ by not\n   sending MDN's automatically.\n"

  contents:

    \  Within\n   the framework of today's Internet Mail, the MDNs defined in this\n\
    \   document provide valuable information to the mail user; however, MDNs\n  \
    \ cannot be relied upon as a guarantee that a message was or was not\n   seen\
    \ by the recipient.  Even if MDNs are not actively forged, they\n   may be lost\
    \ in transit.  The recipient may bypass the MDN issuing\n   mechanism in some\
    \ manner.\n   One possible solution for this purpose can be found in RFC 2634\n\
    \   [SEC-SERVICES].\n"
- title: 6.4.  Mail Bombing
  contents:
  - "6.4.  Mail Bombing\n   The MDN request mechanism introduces an additional way\

    \ to which\n   MDN's should be sent.  It is possible for an attacking agent to\
    \ send\n   a potentially large set of messages to otherwise unsuspecting third\n\
    \   party recipients with a false \"disposition-notification-to:\" address.\n\
    \   Automatic, or simplistic processing of such requests would result in\n   a\
    \ flood of MDN notifications to the target of the attack.  Such an\n   attack\
    \ could overrun the capacity of the targeted mailbox and deny\n   service.\n \
    \  For that reason, MDN's SHOULD NOT be sent automatically where the\n   \"disposition-notification-to:\"\

    \ pair\n   of mail systems may be defined by other documents.\n"
- title: 8.1.  Gatewaying from other mail systems to MDNs
  contents:
  - "8.1.  Gatewaying from other mail systems to MDNs\n   A mail gateway may issue\
    \ an MDN to convey the contents of a \"foreign\"\n   disposition notification\
    \ over Internet Mail.  When there are\n   appropriate mappings from the foreign\
    \ notification elements to MDN\n   fields, the information may be transmitted\
    \ in those MDN fields.\n   Additional information (such as might be needed to\
    \ tunnel the foreign\n   notification through the Internet) may be defined in\
    \ extension MDN\n   fields.  (Such fields should be given names that identify\
    \ the foreign\n   mail protocol, e.g., X400-* for X.400 protocol elements).\n\
    \   The gateway must attempt to supply reasonable values for the\n   Reporting-UA,\
    \ Final-Recipient, and Disposition fields.  These will\n   normally be obtained\
    \ by translating the values from the foreign\n   notification into their Internet-style\
    \ equivalents.  However, some\n   loss of information is to be expected.\n   The\
    \ sender-specified recipient address and the original message-id,\n   if present\
    \ in the foreign notification, should be preserved in the\n   Original-Recipient\
    \ and Original-Message-ID fields.\n   The gateway should also attempt to preserve\
    \ the \"final\" recipient\n   address from the foreign system.  Whenever possible,\
    \ foreign protocol\n   elements should be encoded as meaningful printable ASCII\
    \ strings.\n   For MDNs produced from foreign disposition notifications, the name\
    \ of\n   the gateway MUST appear in the MDN-Gateway field of the MDN.\n"
- title: 8.2.  Gatewaying from MDNs to other mail systems
  contents:
  - "8.2.  Gatewaying from MDNs to other mail systems\n   It may be possible to gateway\
    \ MDNs from the Internet into a foreign\n   mail system.  The primary purpose\
    \ of such gatewaying is to convey\n   disposition information in a form that is\
    \ usable by the destination\n   system.  A secondary purpose is to allow \"tunneling\"\
    \ of MDNs through\n   foreign mail systems in case the MDN may be gatewayed back\
    \ into the\n   Internet.\n   In general, the recipient of the MDN (i.e., the sender\
    \ of the\n   original message) will want to know, for each recipient:  the closest\n\
    \   available approximation to the original recipient address, and the\n   disposition\
    \ (displayed, printed, etc.).\n   If possible, the gateway should attempt to preserve\
    \ the Original-\n   Recipient address and Original-Message-ID (if present) in\
    \ the\n   resulting foreign disposition report.\n   If it is possible to tunnel\
    \ an MDN through the destination\n   environment, the gateway specification may\
    \ define a means of\n   preserving the MDN information in the disposition reports\
    \ used by\n   that environment.\n"
- title: 8.3.  Gatewaying of MDN-requests to other mail systems
  contents:
  - "8.3.  Gatewaying of MDN-requests to other mail systems\n   By use of the separate\
    \ disposition-notification-to request header,\n   this specification offers a\
    \ richer functionality than most, if not\n   all, other email systems.  In most\
    \ other email systems, the\n   notification recipient is identical to the message\
    \ sender as\n   indicated in the \"from\" address.  There are two interesting\
    \ cases\n   when gatewaying into such systems:\n   1) If the address in the disposition-notification-to\
    \ header is\n      identical to the address in the SMTP \"MAIL FROM\", the expected\n\
    \      behavior will result, even if the disposition-notification-to\n      information\
    \ is lost.  Systems should propagate the MDN request.\n   2) If the address in\
    \ the disposition-notification-to header is\n      different from the address\
    \ in the SMTP \"MAIL FROM\", gatewaying\n      into a foreign system without a\
    \ separate notification address will\n      result in unintended behavior.  This\
    \ is especially important when\n      the message arrives via a mailing list expansion\
    \ software that may\n      specifically replace the SMTP \"MAIL FROM\" address\
    \ with an\n      alternate address.  In such cases, the MDN request should not\
    \ be\n      gatewayed and should be silently dropped.  This is consistent with\n\
    \      other forms of non-support for MDN.\n"
