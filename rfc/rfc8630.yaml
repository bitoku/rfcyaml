  - "Abstract\n   This document defines a Trust Anchor Locator (TAL) for the Resource\n\
    \   Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI).  The TAL allows Relying Parties in\n   the\
    \ RPKI to download the current Trust Anchor (TA) Certification\n   Authority (CA)\
    \ certificate from one or more locations and verify that\n   the key of this self-signed\
    \ certificate matches the key on the TAL.\n   Thus, Relying Parties can be configured\
    \ with TA keys but can allow\n   these TAs to change the content of their CA certificate.\
    \  In\n   particular, it allows TAs to change the set of IP Address Delegations\n\
    \   and/or Autonomous System Identifier Delegations included in the\n   extension(s)\
    \ (RFC 3779) of their certificate.\n   This document obsoletes the previous definition\

  - "1.  Introduction\n   This document defines a Trust Anchor Locator (TAL) for the\
    \ Resource\n   Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) [RFC6480].  This format may be\
    \ used\n   to distribute Trust Anchor (TA) material using a mix of out-of-band\n\
    \   and online means.  Procedures used by Relying Parties (RPs) to verify\n  \
    \ RPKI signed objects SHOULD support this format to facilitate\n   interoperability\
    \ between creators of TA material and RPs.  This\n   document obsoletes [RFC7730]\
    \ by adding support for Uniform Resource\n   Identifiers (URIs) [RFC3986] that\
    \ use HTTP over TLS (HTTPS) [RFC7230]\n   as the scheme.\n"

  contents:
  - "1.2.  Changes from RFC 7730\n   The TAL format defined in this document differs\
    \ from the definition\n   in [RFC7730] in that:\n   o  it allows for the use of\
    \ the HTTPS scheme in URIs [RFC7230], and\n   o  it allows for the inclusion of\
    \ an optional comment section.\n   Note that current RPs may not support this\
    \ new format yet.\n   Therefore, it is RECOMMENDED that a TA operator maintain\
    \ a TAL file\n   as defined in [RFC7730] for a time as well, until they are satisfied\n\
    \   that RP tooling has been updated.\n"

- title: 2.1.  Trust Anchor Locator Motivation
  contents:
  - "2.1.  Trust Anchor Locator Motivation\n   This document does not propose a new\
    \ format for TA material.  A TA in\n   the RPKI is represented by a self-signed\
    \ X.509 Certification\n   Authority (CA) certificate, a format commonly used in\
    \ PKIs and widely\n   supported by RP software.  This document specifies a format\
    \ for data\n   used to retrieve and verify the authenticity of a TA in a very\
    \ simple\n   fashion.  That data is referred to as the TAL.\n   The motivation\
    \ for defining the TAL is to enable selected data in the\n   TA to change, without\
    \ needing to redistribute the TA per se.\n   In the RPKI, certificates contain\
    \ one or more extensions [RFC3779]\n   that can contain a set of IP Address Delegations\
    \ and/or Autonomous\n   System Identifier Delegations.  In this document, we refer\
    \ to these\n   delegations as the Internet Number Resources (INRs) contained in\
    \ an\n   RPKI certificate.\n   The set of INRs associated with an entity acting\
    \ as a TA is likely to\n   change over time.  Thus, if one were to use the common\
    \ PKI convention\n   of distributing a TA to RPs in a secure fashion, then this\
    \ procedure\n   would need to be repeated whenever the INR set for the entity\
    \ acting\n   as a TA changed.  By distributing the TAL (in a secure fashion)\n\
    \   instead of distributing the TA, this problem is avoided, i.e., the\n   TAL\
    \ is constant so long as the TA's public key and its location do\n   not change.\n\
    \   The TAL is analogous to the TrustAnchorInfo data structure specified\n   in\
    \ [RFC5914], which is on the Standards Track.  That specification\n   could be\
    \ used to represent the TAL, if one defined an rsync or HTTPS\n   URI extension\
    \ for that data structure.  However, the TAL format was\n   adopted by RPKI implementors\
    \ prior to the PKIX TA work, and the RPKI\n   implementor community has elected\
    \ to utilize the TAL format rather\n   than define the requisite extension.  The\
    \ community also prefers the\n   simplicity of the ASCII encoding of the TAL,\
    \ versus the binary\n   (ASN.1) encoding for TrustAnchorInfo.\n"
- title: 2.2.  Trust Anchor Locator File Format
  contents:
  - "2.2.  Trust Anchor Locator File Format\n   In this document, we define a TA URI\
    \ as a URI that can be used to\n   retrieve a current TA certificate.  This URI\
    \ MUST be either an rsync\n   URI [RFC5781] or an HTTPS URI [RFC7230].\n   The\
    \ TAL is an ordered sequence of:\n   1.  an optional comment section consisting\
    \ of one or more lines each\n       starting with the \"#\" character, followed\
    \ by human-readable\n       informational UTF-8 text, conforming to the restrictions\
    \ defined\n       in Section 2 of [RFC5198], and ending with a line break,\n \
    \  2.  a URI section that is comprised of one or more ordered lines,\n       each\
    \ containing a TA URI, and ending with a line break,\n   3.  a line break, and\n\
    \   4.  a subjectPublicKeyInfo [RFC5280] in DER format [X.509], encoded\n    \
    \   in base64 (see Section 4 of [RFC4648]).  To avoid long lines,\n       line\
    \ breaks MAY be inserted into the base64-encoded string.\n   Note that line breaks\
    \ in this file can use either \"<CRLF>\" or \"<LF>\".\n"
- title: 2.3.  TAL and TA Certificate Considerations
  contents:
  - "2.3.  TAL and TA Certificate Considerations\n   Each TA URI in the TAL MUST reference\
    \ a single object.  It MUST NOT\n   reference a directory or any other form of\
    \ collection of objects.\n   The referenced object MUST be a self-signed CA certificate\
    \ that\n   conforms to the RPKI certificate profile [RFC6487].  This certificate\n\
    \   is the TA in certification path discovery [RFC4158] and validation\n   [RFC5280]\
    \ [RFC3779].\n   The validity interval of this TA is chosen such that (1) the\n\
    \   \"notBefore\" time predates the moment that this certificate is\n   published\
    \ and (2) the \"notAfter\" time is after the planned time of\n   reissuance of\
    \ this certificate.\n   The INR extension(s) of this TA MUST contain a non-empty\
    \ set of\n   number resources.  It MUST NOT use the \"inherit\" form of the INR\n\
    \   extension(s).  The INR set described in this certificate is the set\n   of\
    \ number resources for which the issuing entity is offering itself\n   as a putative\
    \ TA in the RPKI [RFC6480].\n   The public key used to verify the TA MUST be the\
    \ same as the\n   subjectPublicKeyInfo in the CA certificate and in the TAL.\n\
    \   The TA MUST contain a stable key that does not change when the\n   certificate\
    \ is reissued due to changes in the INR extension(s), when\n   the certificate\
    \ is renewed prior to expiration.\n   Because the public key in the TAL and the\
    \ TA MUST be stable, this\n   motivates operation of that CA in an offline mode.\
    \  In that case, a\n   subordinate CA certificate containing the same INRs, or,\
    \ in theory,\n   any subset of INRs, can be issued for online operations.  This\
    \ allows\n   the entity that issues the TA to keep the corresponding private key\n\
    \   of this certificate offline, while issuing all relevant child\n   certificates\
    \ under the immediate subordinate CA.  This measure also\n   allows the Certificate\
    \ Revocation List (CRL) issued by that entity to\n   be used to revoke the subordinate\
    \ CA certificate in the event of\n   suspected key compromise of this online operational\
    \ key pair that is\n   potentially more vulnerable.\n   The TA MUST be published\
    \ at a stable URI.  When the TA is reissued\n   for any reason, the replacement\
    \ CA certificate MUST be accessible\n   using the same URI.\n   Because the TA\
    \ is a self-signed certificate, there is no\n   corresponding CRL that can be\
    \ used to revoke it, nor is there a\n   manifest [RFC6486] that lists this certificate.\n\
    \   If an entity wishes to withdraw a self-signed CA certificate as a\n   putative\
    \ TA, for any reason, including key rollover, the entity MUST\n   remove the object\
    \ from the location referenced in the TAL.\n   Where the TAL contains two or more\
    \ TA URIs, the same self-signed\n   CA certificate MUST be found at each referenced\
    \ location.  In order\n   to increase operational resilience, it is RECOMMENDED\
    \ that\n   (1) the domain name parts of each of these URIs resolve to distinct\n\
    \   IP addresses that are used by a diverse set of repository publication\n  \
    \ points and (2) these IP addresses be included in distinct Route\n   Origin Authorization\
    \ (ROA) objects signed by different CAs.\n"

- title: 3.  Relying Party Use
  contents:
  - "3.  Relying Party Use\n   In order to use the TAL to retrieve and validate a\
    \ (putative) TA, an\n   RP SHOULD:\n   1.  Retrieve the object referenced by (one\
    \ of) the TA URI(s)\n       contained in the TAL.\n   2.  Confirm that the retrieved\
    \ object is a current, self-signed RPKI\n       CA certificate that conforms to\
    \ the profile as specified in\n       [RFC6487].\n   3.  Confirm that the public\
    \ key in the TAL matches the public key in\n       the retrieved object.\n   4.\
    \  Perform other checks, as deemed appropriate (locally), to ensure\n       that\
    \ the RP is willing to accept the entity publishing this\n       self-signed CA\
    \ certificate to be a TA.  These tests apply to the\n       validity of attestations\
    \ made in the context of the RPKI relating\n       to all resources described\
    \ in the INR extension(s) of this\n       certificate.\n   An RP SHOULD perform\
    \ these functions for each instance of a TAL that\n   it is holding for this purpose\
    \ every time the RP performs a\n   resynchronization across the local repository\
    \ cache.  In any case, an\n   RP also SHOULD perform these functions prior to\
    \ the expiration of the\n   locally cached copy of the retrieved TA referenced\
    \ by the TAL.\n   In the case where a TAL contains multiple TA URIs, an RP MAY\
    \ use a\n   locally defined preference rule to select the URI to retrieve the\n\
    \   self-signed RPKI CA certificate that is to be used as a TA.  Some\n   examples\
    \ are:\n   o  Using the order provided in the TAL\n   o  Selecting the TA URI\
    \ randomly from the available list\n   o  Creating a prioritized list of URIs\
    \ based on RP-specific\n      parameters, such as connection establishment delay\n\
    \   If the connection to the preferred URI fails or the retrieved CA\n   certificate\
    \ public key does not match the TAL public key, the RP\n   SHOULD retrieve the\
    \ CA certificate from the next URI, according to\n   the local preference ranking\
    \ of URIs.\n"
- title: 4.  URI Scheme Considerations
  contents:
  - "4.  URI Scheme Considerations\n   Please note that the RSYNC protocol provides\
    \ neither transport\n   security nor any means by which the RP can validate that\
    \ they are\n   connected to the proper host.  Therefore, it is RECOMMENDED that\n\
    \   HTTPS be used as the preferred scheme.\n   Note that, although a Man in the\
    \ Middle (MITM) cannot produce a CA\n   certificate that would be considered valid\
    \ according to the process\n   described in Section 3, this type of attack can\
    \ prevent the RP from\n   learning about an updated CA certificate.\n   RPs MUST\
    \ do TLS certificate and host name validation when they fetch\n   a CA certificate\
    \ using an HTTPS URI on a TAL.  RPs SHOULD log any TLS\n   certificate or host\
    \ name validation issues found so that an operator\n   can investigate the cause.\n\
    \   It is RECOMMENDED that RPs and Repository Servers follow the Best\n   Current\
    \ Practices outlined in [RFC7525] on the use of HTTPS\n   [RFC7230].  RPs SHOULD\
    \ do TLS certificate and host name validation\n   using subjectAltName dNSName\
    \ identities as described in [RFC6125].\n   The rules and guidelines defined in\
    \ [RFC6125] apply here, with the\n   following considerations:\n   o  RPs and\
    \ Repository Servers SHOULD support the DNS-ID identifier\n      type.  The DNS-ID\
    \ identifier type SHOULD be present in Repository\n      Server certificates.\n\
    \   o  DNS names in Repository Server certificates SHOULD NOT contain the\n  \
    \    wildcard character \"*\".\n   o  This protocol does not require the use of\
    \ SRV-IDs.\n   o  This protocol does not require the use of URI-IDs.\n"
- title: 5.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "5.  Security Considerations\n   Compromise of a TA private key permits unauthorized\
    \ parties to\n   masquerade as a TA, with potentially severe consequences.  Reliance\n\
    \   on an inappropriate or incorrect TA has similar potentially severe\n   consequences.\n\
    \   This TAL does not directly provide a list of resources covered by the\n  \
    \ referenced self-signed CA certificate.  Instead, the RP is referred\n   to the\
    \ TA itself and the INR extension(s) within this certificate.\n   This provides\
    \ necessary operational flexibility, but it also allows\n   the certificate issuer\
    \ to claim to be authoritative for any resource.\n   RPs should either (1) have\
    \ great confidence in the issuers of such\n   certificates that they are configuring\
    \ as TAs or (2) issue their own\n   self-signed certificate as a TA and, in doing\
    \ so, impose constraints\n   on the subordinate certificates.\n"
