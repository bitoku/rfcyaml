- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) defined in\
    \ [RFC2131]\n   provides configuration parameters to hosts on an IP-based network.\n\
    \   DHCP is built on a client-server model, where designated DHCP servers\n  \
    \ allocate network addresses and deliver configuration parameters to\n   dynamically\
    \ configured hosts.\n   The changes to [RFC2131] defined in this document clarify\
    \ the use of\n   the 'client identifier' option by the DHCP servers.  The\n  \
    \ clarification addresses the issues (as mentioned in Problem\n   Statement) arising\
    \ out of the point specified by [RFC2131] that the\n   server MUST NOT return\
    \ the 'client identifier' option to the client.\n"

    MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n   document are to be interpreted as described\
    \ in [RFC2119].\n"
- title: 2.  Problem Statement
  contents:
  - "2.  Problem Statement\n   [RFC2131] specifies that a combination of 'client identifier'\
    \ or\n   'chaddr' and assigned network address constitute a unique identifier\n\
    \   for the client's lease and are used by both the client and server to\n   identify\
    \ a lease referred in any DHCP messages.  [RFC2131] also\n   specifies that the\
    \ server MUST NOT return the 'client identifier'\n   option in DHCPOFFER and DHCPACK\
    \ messages.  Furthermore, DHCP relay\n   agents and servers implementing [RFC2131]\
    \ MAY drop the DHCP packets\n   in the absence of both the 'client identifier'\
    \ and 'chaddr' option.\n   In some cases, a client may not have a valid hardware\
    \ address to\n   populate the 'chaddr' field and may set the field to all zeroes.\
    \  One\n   such example is when DHCP is used to assign an IP address to a mobile\n\
    \   phone or a tablet and where the 'chaddr' field is set to zero in DHCP\n  \
    \ request packets.  In such cases, the client usually sets the 'client\n   identifier'\
    \ option field (to a value as permitted in [RFC2131]), and\n   both the client\
    \ and server use this field to uniquely identify the\n   client with in a subnet.\n\
    \   Note that due to aforementioned recommendations in [RFC2131], valid\n   downstream\
    \ DHCP packets (DHCPOFFER, DHCPACK, and DHCPNAK) from the\n   server MAY get dropped\
    \ at the DHCP relay agent in the absence of the\n   'client identifier' option\
    \ when the 'chaddr' field is set to zero.\n   The problem may get aggravated when\
    \ a client receives a response from\n   the server without 'client identifier'\
    \ and with the 'chaddr' value\n   set to zero, as it cannot guarantee that the\
    \ response is intended for\n   it.  This is due to the fact that even though the\
    \ 'xid' field is\n   present to map responses with requests, this field alone\
    \ cannot\n   guarantee that a particular response is for a particular client,\
    \ as\n   'xid' values generated by multiple clients within a subnet need not\n\
    \   be unique.\n   Lack of the 'client identifier' option in DHCP reply messages\
    \ also\n   affects the scenario where multiple DHCP clients may be running on\n\
    \   the same host sharing the same 'chaddr'.\n   This document attempts to address\
    \ these problems faced by the DHCP\n   relay agent and client by proposing modification\
    \ to DHCP server\n   behavior.  The solution specified in this document is in\
    \ line with\n   DHCPv6 [RFC3315] where the server always includes the Client\n\
    \   Identifier option in the Reply messages.\n   The requirement for DHCP servers\
    \ not to return the 'client\n   identifier' option was made purely to conserve\
    \ the limited space in\n   the packet.  It is possible, though unlikely, that\
    \ clients will drop\n   packets that contain this formerly unexpected option.\
    \  There are no\n   known client implementations that will drop packets, but the\
    \ benefit\n   provided by this change outweighs any small risk of such behavior.\n\
    \   More harm is being done by not having the 'client identifier' option\n   present\
    \ than might be done by adding it now.\n"
- title: 3.  Modification to RFC 2131
  contents:
  - "3.  Modification to RFC 2131\n   If the 'client identifier' option is present\
    \ in a message received\n   from a client, the server MUST return the 'client\
    \ identifier' option,\n   unaltered, in its response message.\n   The following\
    \ table is extracted from Section 4.3.1 of [RFC2131] and\n   relevant fields are\
    \ modified accordingly to overcome the problems\n   mentioned in this document.\n\
    \   Option                    DHCPOFFER    DHCPACK            DHCPNAK\n   ------\
    \                    ---------    -------            -------\n   Client identifier\
    \ (if     MUST         MUST               MUST\n     sent by client)\n   Client\
    \ identifier (if     MUST NOT     MUST NOT           MUST NOT\n     not sent by\
    \ client)\n   When a client receives a DHCP message containing a 'client\n   identifier'\
    \ option, the client MUST compare that client identifier to\n   the one it is\
    \ configured to send.  If the two client identifiers do\n   not match, the client\
    \ MUST silently discard the message.\n"
- title: 4.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "4.  Security Considerations\n   This specification does not add any new security\
    \ considerations other\n   than the ones already mentioned in [RFC2131].  It is\
    \ worth noting\n   that DHCP clients routinely connect to different IP networks\
    \ managed\n   by different network providers.  DHCP clients have no a priori\n\
    \   knowledge of which network they are connecting to.  Consequently, the\n  \
    \ client identifier will, by definition, be routinely shared with\n   network\
    \ operators and could be used in ways that violate the user's\n   privacy.  This\
    \ is a problem that existed in [RFC2131].  This document\n   does nothing to address\
    \ this problem.\n"
