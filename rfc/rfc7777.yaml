  - "Abstract\n   This document describes an extension to the OSPF protocol to add
    an\n   optional operational capability that allows tagging and grouping of\n   the
    nodes in an OSPF domain.  This allows simplification, ease of\n   management and
    control over route and path selection based on\n   configured policies.  This
    document describes an extension to the\n   OSPF protocol to advertise node administrative
    tags.  The node tags\n   can be used to express and apply locally defined network
    policies,\n   which are a very useful operational capability.  Node tags may be\n
    \  used by either OSPF itself or other applications consuming\n   information
    propagated via OSPF.\n   This document describes the protocol extensions to disseminate
    node\n   administrative tags to the OSPFv2 and OSPFv3 protocol.  It provides\n
    \  example use cases of administrative node tags.\n"

  - "1.  Introduction\n   It is useful to assign a node administrative tag to a router
    in the\n   OSPF domain and use it as an attribute associated with the node.  The\n
    \  node administrative tag can be used in a variety of applications, for\n   example:\n
    \  (a)  Traffic Engineering (TE) applications to provide different path-\n        selection
    criteria.\n   (b)  Prefer or prune certain paths in Loop-Free Alternate (LFA)\n
    \       backup selection via local policies as defined in [LFA-MANAGE].\n   This
    document provides mechanisms to advertise node administrative\n   tags in OSPF
    for route and path selection.  Route and path selection\n   functionality applies
    to both TE and non-TE applications; hence, a\n   new TLV for carrying node administrative
    tags is included in Router\n   Information (RI) Link State Advertisement (LSA)
    [RFC7770].\n   The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\",
    \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\"
    in this\n   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].\n"

  - "2.  OSPF Node Admin Tag TLV\n   An administrative tag is a 32-bit integer value
    that can be used to\n   identify a group of nodes in the OSPF domain.\n   The
    newly defined TLV is carried within an RI LSA for OSPFV2 and\n   OSPFV3.  RI LSA
    [RFC7770] can have flooding scope at the link, area,\n   or Autonomous System
    (AS) level.  The choice of what scope at which\n   to flood the group tags is
    a matter of local policy.  It is expected\n   that node administrative tag values
    will not be portable across\n   administrative domains.\n   The TLV specifies
    one or more administrative tag values.  An OSPF\n   node advertises the set of
    groups it is part of in the OSPF domain\n   (for example, all PE nodes are configured
    with a certain tag value,\n   and all P nodes are configured with a different
    tag value in the\n   domain).  Multiple TLVs MAY be added in same RI LSA or in

      - "2.2.1.  Interpretation of Node Administrative Tags\n   The meaning of the
        node administrative tags is generally opaque to\n   OSPF.  Routers advertising
        the node administrative tag (or tags) may\n   be configured to do so without
        knowing (or even without supporting\n   processing of) the functionality implied
        by the tag.  This section\n   describes general rules, regulations, and guidelines
        for using and\n   interpreting an administrative tag that will facilitate
        interoperable\n   implementations by vendors.\n   Interpretation of tag values
        is specific to the administrative domain\n   of a particular network operator;
        hence, tag values SHOULD NOT be\n   propagated outside the administrative
        domain to which they apply.\n   The meaning of a node administrative tag is
        defined by the network\n   local policy and is controlled via the configuration.
        \ If a receiving\n   node does not understand the tag value or does not have
        a local\n   policy corresponding to the tag, it ignores the specific tag and\n
        \  floods the RI LSA without any change as defined in [RFC7770].\n   The semantics
        of the tag order has no meaning.  That is, there is no\n   implied meaning
        to the ordering of the tags that indicates a certain\n   operation or set
        of operations that need to be performed based on the\n   ordering.\n   Each
        tag must be treated as an independent identifier that may be\n   used in the
        policy to perform a policy action.  Each tag carried by\n   the Node Admin
        Tag TLV should be used to indicate a characteristic of\n   a node that is
        independent of the characteristics indicated by other\n   administrative tags.
        \ The administrative-tag list within the TLV MUST\n   be considered an unordered
        list.  While policies may be implemented\n   based on the presence of multiple
        tags (e.g., if tag A AND tag B are\n   present), they MUST NOT be reliant
        upon the order of the tags (i.e.,\n   all policies should be considered commutative
        operations, such that\n   tag A preceding or following tag B does not change
        their outcome).\n"

      - "2.2.2.  Use of Node Administrative Tags\n   The node administrative tags
        are not meant to be extended by future\n   OSPF standards.  New OSPF extensions
        are not expected to require use\n   of node administrative tags or define
        well-known tag values.  Node\n   administrative tags are for generic use and
        do not require IANA\n   registration.  Future OSPF extensions requiring well-known
        values MAY\n   define their own data signaling tailored to the needs of the
        feature\n   or MAY use the capability TLV as defined in [RFC7770].\n   Being
        part of the RI LSA, the Node Admin Tag TLV must be reasonably\n   small and
        stable.  In particular, implementations supporting node\n   administrative
        tags MUST NOT be used to convey attributes of the\n   routing topology or
        associate tags with changes in the network\n   topology (both within and outside
        the OSPF domain) or reachability of\n   routes.\n"

        Tag TLVs MAY appear in an RI LSA or multiple Node\n   Admin Tag TLVs MAY be
        contained in different instances of the RI LSA.\n   The administrative tags
        associated with a node that originates tags\n   for the purpose of any computation
        or processing at a receiving node\n   SHOULD be a superset of node administrative
        tags from all the TLVs in\n   all the received RI LSA instances in the Link-State
        Database (LSDB)\n   advertised by the corresponding OSPF router.  When an
        RI LSA is\n   received that changes the set of tags applicable to any originating\n
        \  node, which has features depending on node administrative tags, a\n   receiving
        node MUST repeat any computation or processing that is\n   based on those
        administrative tags.\n   When there is a change or removal of an administrative
        affiliation of\n   a node, the node MUST re-originate the RI LSA with the
        latest set of\n   node administrative tags.  On the receiver, when there is
        a change in\n   the Node Admin Tag TLV or removal/addition of a TLV in any
        instance\n   of the RI LSA, implementations MUST take appropriate measures
        to\n   update their state according to the changed set of tags.  The exact\n

    supporting this specification are not required to\n   implement any of these use

    - "3.1.  Service Auto-Discovery\n   Router tagging may be used to automatically
      discover a group of\n   routers sharing a particular service.\n   For example,
      a service provider might desire to establish a full mesh\n   of MPLS TE tunnels
      between all PE routers in the area of the MPLS VPN\n   network.  Marking all
      PE routers with a tag and configuring devices\n   with a policy to create MPLS
      TE tunnels to all other devices\n   advertising this tag will automate maintenance
      of the full mesh.\n   When a new PE router is added to the area, all other PE
      devices will\n   open TE tunnels to it without needing to reconfigure them.\n"

    - "3.2.  Fast-Rerouting Policy\n   Increased deployment of Loop-Free Alternates
      (LFA) as defined in\n   [RFC5286] poses operation and management challenges.
      \ [LFA-MANAGE]\n   proposes policies which, when implemented, will ease LFA
      operation\n   concerns.\n   One of the proposed refinements is to be able to
      group the nodes in\n   an IGP domain with administrative tags and engineer the
      LFA based on\n   configured policies.\n   (a)  Administrative limitation of
      LFA scope\n       Service provider access infrastructure is frequently designed
      in\n       a layered approach with each layer of devices serving different\n
      \      purposes and thus having different hardware capabilities and\n       configured
      software features.  When LFA repair paths are being\n       computed, it may
      be desirable to exclude devices from being\n       considered as LFA candidates
      based on their layer.\n       For example, if the access infrastructure is divided
      into the\n       Access, Distribution, and Core layers, it may be desirable
      for a\n       Distribution device to compute LFA only via Distribution or Core\n
      \      devices but not via Access devices.  This may be due to features\n       enabled
      on Access routers, due to capacity limitations, or due to\n       the security
      requirements.  Managing such a policy via\n       configuration of the router
      computing LFA is cumbersome and error\n       prone.\n       With the node administrative
      tags, it is possible to assign a tag\n       to each layer and implement LFA
      policy of computing LFA repair\n       paths only via neighbors that advertise
      the Core or Distribution\n       tag.  This requires minimal per-node configuration
      and the\n       network automatically adapts when new links or routers are added.\n
      \  (b)  LFA calculation optimization\n       Calculation of LFA paths may require
      significant resources of the\n       router.  One execution of Dijkstra's algorithm
      is required for\n       each neighbor eligible to become the next hop of repair
      paths.\n       Thus, a router with a few hundred neighbors may need to execute\n
      \      the algorithm hundreds of times before the best (or even valid)\n       repair
      path is found.  Manually excluding from the calculation\n       neighbors that
      are known to provide no valid LFA (such as single-\n       connected routers)
      may significantly reduce the number of\n       Dijkstra algorithm runs.\n       LFA
      calculation policy may be configured so that routers\n       advertising certain
      tag values are excluded from LFA calculation,\n       even if they are otherwise
      suitable.\n"

    - "3.3.  Controlling Remote LFA Tunnel Termination\n   [RFC7490] defined a method
      of tunneling traffic to extend the basic\n   LFA coverage after connection failure
      of a link and defined an\n   algorithm to find tunnel tail-end routers meeting
      the LFA\n   requirement.  In most cases, the proposed algorithm finds more than\n
      \  one candidate tail-end router.  In a real-life network, it may be\n   desirable
      to exclude some nodes from the list of candidates based on\n   the local policy.
      \ This may be either due to known limitations of the\n   node (the router does
      not accept the targeted LDP sessions required\n   to implement remote LFA tunneling)
      or due to administrative\n   requirements (for example, it may be desirable
      to choose the tail-end\n   router among colocated devices).\n   The node administrative
      tag delivers a simple and scalable solution.\n   Remote LFA can be configured
      with a policy to accept only routers\n   advertising a certain tag as candidates
      during the tail-end router\n   calculation.  Tagging routers allows both exclusion
      of nodes not\n   capable of serving as remote LFA tunnel tail ends and definition
      of a\n   region from which a tail-end router must be selected.\n"

      Backhaul Network\n   A typical mobile backhaul network with access rings and
      aggregate\n   links is shown in the figure above.  The mobile backhaul networks\n
      \  deploy traffic engineering due to strict Service Level Agreements\n   (SLAs).
      \ The TE paths may have additional constraints to avoid\n   passing via different
      access rings or to get completely disjoint\n   backup TE paths.  The mobile
      backhaul networks towards the access\n   side change frequently due to the growing
      mobile traffic and addition\n   of new eNodeBs.  It's complex to satisfy the
      requirements using cost,\n   link color, or explicit path configurations.  The
      node administrative\n   tag defined in this document can be effectively used
      to solve the\n   problem for mobile backhaul networks.  The nodes in different
      rings\n   can be assigned with specific tags.  TE path computation can be\n
      \  enhanced to consider additional constraints based on node\n   administrative
      tags.\n"

    - "3.5.  Explicit Routing Policy\n   A partially meshed network provides multiple
      paths between any two\n   nodes in the network.  In a data centre environment,
      the topology is\n   usually highly symmetric with many/all paths having equal
      cost.  In a\n   long distance network, this is usually not the case, for a variety
      of\n   reasons (e.g., historic, fibre availability constraints, different\n
      \  distances between transit nodes, and different roles).  Hence,\n   between
      a given source and destination, a path is typically preferred\n   over the others,
      while between the same source and another\n   destination, a different path
      may be preferred.\n        +----------------------+   +----------------+\n        |

      \                   Figure 3: Explicit Routing topology\n   In the above topology,
      an operator may want to enforce the following\n   high-level explicit routing
      policies:\n   o  Traffic from A nodes to A nodes should preferably go through
      R or\n      T nodes (rather than through I nodes);\n   o  Traffic from A nodes
      to I nodes must not go through R and T nodes.\n   With node admin tags, tag
      A (resp. I, R, T) can be configured on all\n   A (resp.  I, R, T) nodes to advertise
      their role.  The first policy\n   is about preferring one path over another.
      \ Given the chosen metrics,\n   it is achieved with regular SPF routing.  The
      second policy is about\n   prohibiting (pruning) some paths.  It requires an
      explicit routing\n   policy.  With the use of node tags, this may be achieved
      with a\n   generic Constrained Shortest Path First (CSPF) policy configured
      on A\n   nodes: for destination nodes, having the tag \"A\" runs a CSPF with
      the\n   exclusion of nodes having the tag \"I\".\n"

  - "4.  Security Considerations\n   Node administrative tags may be used by operators
    to indicate\n   geographical location or other sensitive information.  As indicated\n
    \  in [RFC2328] and [RFC5340], OSPF authentication mechanisms do not\n   provide
    confidentiality and the information carried in node\n   administrative tags could
    be leaked to an IGP snooper.\n   Confidentiality for the OSPF control packets
    can be achieved by\n   either running OSPF on top of IP Security (IPsec) tunnels
    or by\n   applying IPsec-based security mechanisms as described in [RFC4552].\n
    \  Advertisement of tag values for one administrative domain into\n   another
    risks misinterpretation of the tag values (if the two domains\n   have assigned
    different meanings to the same values), which may have\n   undesirable and unanticipated
    side effects.\n   [RFC4593] and [RFC6863] discuss the generic threats to routing\n
    \  protocols and OSPF, respectively.  These security threats are also\n   applicable
    to the mechanisms described in this document.  OSPF\n   authentication described
    in [RFC2328] and [RFC5340] or extended\n   authentication mechanisms described
    in [RFC7474] or [RFC7166] SHOULD\n   be used in deployments where attackers have
    access to the physical\n   networks and nodes included in the OSPF domain are
    vulnerable.\n"
  title: 4.  Security Considerations
- contents:
  - "5.  Operational Considerations\n   Operators can assign meaning to the node administrative
    tags, which\n   are local to the operator's administrative domain.  The operational\n
    \  use of node administrative tags is analogical to the IS-IS prefix\n   tags
    [RFC5130] and BGP communities [RFC1997].  Operational discipline\n   and procedures
    followed in configuring and using BGP communities and\n   IS-IS prefix tags is
    also applicable to the usage of node\n   administrative tags.\n   Defining language
    for local policies is outside the scope of this\n   document.  As is the case
    of other policy applications, the pruning\n   policies can cause the path to be
    completely removed from forwarding\n   plane, and hence have the potential for
    more severe operational\n   impact (e.g., node unreachability due to path removal)
    by comparison\n   to preference policies that only affect path selection.\n"

  - "6.  Manageability Considerations\n   Node administrative tags are configured
    and managed using routing\n   policy enhancements.  The YANG data definition language
    is the latest\n   model to describe and define configuration for network devices.
    \ The\n   OSPF YANG data model is described in [OSPF-YANG] and the routing\n   policy
    configuration model is described in [RTG-POLICY].  These two\n   documents will
    be enhanced to include the configurations related to\n   the node administrative
    tag.\n"
