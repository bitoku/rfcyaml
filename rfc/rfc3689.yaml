- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   Effective telecommunications capabilities can be imperative\
    \ to\n   facilitate immediate recovery operations for serious disaster events,\n\
    \   such as, hurricanes, floods, earthquakes, and terrorist attacks.\n   Disasters\
    \ can happen any time, any place, unexpectedly.  Quick\n   response for recovery\
    \ operations requires immediate access to any\n   public telecommunications capabilities\
    \ at hand.  These capabilities\n   include:  conventional telephone, cellular\
    \ phones, and Internet\n   access via online terminals, IP telephones, and wireless\
    \ PDAs.  The\n   commercial telecommunications infrastructure is rapidly evolving\
    \ to\n   Internet-based technology.  Therefore, the Internet community needs\n\
    \   to consider how it can best support emergency management and recovery\n  \
    \ operations.\n   The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\"\
    , \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and\
    \ \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n   document are to be interpreted as described in BCP\
    \ 14, RFC 2119 [1].\n"
- title: 1.1.  Terminology
  contents:
  - "1.1.  Terminology\n   Label:\n      The term label has been used for a number\
    \ of years in various IETF\n      protocols.  It is simply an identifier.  It\
    \ can be manifested in\n      the form of a numeric, alphanumeric value, or a\
    \ specific bit\n      pattern, within a field of a packet header.  The exact form\
    \ is\n      dependent on the protocol in which it is used.\n      An example of\
    \ a label can be found in RFC 3031; the Multiprotocol\n      Label Switching Architecture.\
    \  Another example can be found in RFC\n      2597 (and updated by RFC 3260);\
    \ a bit pattern for the Assured\n      Forwarding PHB group.  This latter case\
    \ is a type of label that\n      does not involve routing.  Note that specification\
    \ of labels is\n      outside the scope of this document.  Further comments on\
    \ labels\n      are discussed below in section 3.\n"
- title: 1.2.  Existing Emergency Related Standards
  contents:
  - "1.2.  Existing Emergency Related Standards\n      The following are standards\
    \ from other organizations that are\n      specifically aimed at supporting emergency\
    \ communications.  Most\n      of these standards specify telephony mechanisms\
    \ or define\n      telephony related labels.\n       Standard   / Organization\n\
    \      --------------------------\n      1) T1.631   /   ANSI\n      2) E.106\
    \    /   ITU\n      3) F.706    /   ITU\n      4) H.460.4  /   ITU\n      5) I.255.3\
    \  /   ITU\n   The first specifies an indicator for SS7 networks that signals\
    \ the\n   need for a High Probability of Completion (HPC) service.  This\n   indicator\
    \ is termed National Security / Emergency Preparedness\n   (NS/EP) The T1.631\
    \ standard [2] is the basis for the U.S. Government\n   Emergency Telecommunications\
    \ Service (GETS) [7].\n   The second standard describes functional capabilities\
    \ for the Public\n   Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) to support International\
    \ Emergency\n   Preparedness System (IEPS) [3].  From the PSTN perspective, one\
    \ can\n   view NS/EP as a standard with national boundaries, while IEPS is an\n\
    \   extension to international boundaries for telephony.\n   The third standard\
    \ extends IEPS beyond the scope of telephony into\n   other forms that encompass\
    \ multimedia [4].\n   The fourth and fifth standard focuses on a multi-level labeling\n\
    \   mechanism distinguishing emergency type traffic from that which is\n   not.\
    \  The former case focuses on call signaling for H.323 networks\n   [5], while\
    \ the latter has been applied for both SS7 [6] and data\n   networks.\n   While\
    \ the above standards are outside the scope of the IETF, they do\n   represent\
    \ existing efforts in the area of emergency communications,\n   as opposed to\
    \ conceptual of potential possibilities.  They act as\n   example manifestations\
    \ of Emergency Telecommunications Service (ETS).\n"
- title: 1.3.  Problem
  contents:
  - "1.3.  Problem\n   One problem faced by the IEPREP working group entails how,\
    \ and to\n   what degree, support for these standards are to be realized within\n\
    \   the Internet architecture and the existing suite of IETF standards\n   and\
    \ associated working groups.  This support could be in the form of\n   interoperability\
    \ with corresponding IETF protocols.\n   A subsequent problem is to ensure that\
    \ requirements associated with\n   potential support is not focused just on IP\
    \ telephony applications.\n   The I-Am-Alive (IAA) database system is an example\
    \ of an ETS type\n   application used in Japan that supports both signaled and\
    \ non-\n   signaled access by users [10].  It is a distributed database system\n\
    \   that provides registration, querying, and reply primitives to\n   participants\
    \ during times of an emergency (e.g., an earthquake) so\n   that others can make\
    \ an after-the-event determination about the\n   status of a person.  In this\
    \ case, a separate signaling protocol like\n   SIP is not always required to establish\
    \ or maintain a connection.\n   Given the case where signaling is optional, requirements\
    \ and\n   subsequent solutions that address these problems must not assume the\n\
    \   existence of signaling and must be able to support applications that\n   only\
    \ have labels in data packets.  These label(s) may be in various\n   places, such\
    \ as the application or IP header.\n"
- title: 2.  Scope
  contents:
  - "2.  Scope\n   This document defines a set of general system requirements to achieve\n\
    \   support for ETS and addressing the problem space presented in Section\n  \
    \ 1.3.  In defining these requirements, we consider known systems such\n   as\
    \ GETS and IAA that represent existing manifestations of emergency\n   related\
    \ systems.  These two examples also represent a broad spectrum\n   of characteristics\
    \ that range from signaling & interactive non-\n   elastic applications to non-signaled\
    \ & elastic applications.\n   We stress that ETS, and its associated requirements,\
    \ is not the only\n   means of supporting authorized emergency communications.\
    \  It is\n   simply an approach influenced by existing systems and standards.\n\
    \   Solutions to requirements are not defined.  This document does not\n   specify\
    \ protocol enhancements or specifications.  Requirements for\n   specific types\
    \ of applications that go beyond the general set stated\n   in section 3 are to\
    \ be specified in other document(s).  At the\n   current writing of this document,\
    \ [9] has been written for the case\n   of IP telephony.\n   The current IEPREP\
    \ charter stipulates that any proposed solution to\n   support ETS that responds\
    \ to the requirements of this document are to\n   be developed in other working\
    \ groups.  We note that other specific\n   requirements (like that of IP telephony)\
    \ may be defined as an\n   extension of the general requirements presented in\
    \ section 3 below.\n"
- title: 2.1.  Out of Scope
  contents:
  - "2.1.  Out of Scope\n   While the problem space stated in section 1.3 includes\
    \ standards\n   related to telephony, this document is meant to be broader in\
    \ scope.\n   Hence, emulation of specific architectures, like the PSTN, or focus\n\
    \   on a specific application is out of scope.  Further, the\n   specifications\
    \ of requirements that are aimed at adhering to\n   regulations or laws of governments\
    \ is also out of the scope of this\n   document.  The focus of the IETF and its\
    \ working groups is technical\n   positions that follow the architecture of the\
    \ Internet.\n   Another item that is not in scope of this document is mandating\n\
    \   acceptance and support of the requirements presented in this\n   document.\
    \  There is an expectation that business contracts, (e.g.,\n   Service Level Agreements),\
    \ will be used to satisfy those requirements\n   that apply to service providers.\
    \  Absence of an SLA implies best\n   effort service is provided.\n"
- title: 3.  General Requirements
  contents:
  - "3.  General Requirements\n   These are general requirements that apply to authorized\
    \ emergency\n   telecommunications service.  The first requirement is presented\
    \ as a\n   conditional one since not all applications use or are reliant on\n\
    \   signaling.\n   1) Signaling\n      IF signaling is to be used to convey the\
    \ state or existence of\n      emergency, then signaling mechanism(s) MUST exist\
    \ to carry\n      applicable labels.\n   2) Labels\n      Labels may exist in\
    \ various forms at different layers.  They might\n      be carried as part of\
    \ signaling, and/or as part of the header of a\n      data packet.  Labels from\
    \ different layers are NOT required to be\n      the same, but MAY be related\
    \ to each other.\n   3) Policy\n      Policy MUST be kept separate from label(s).\
    \  This topic has\n      generated a fair amount of debate, and so we provide\
    \ additional\n      guidance from the following:\n      A set of labels may be\
    \ defined as being related to each other.\n      Characteristics (e.g., drop precedence)\
    \ may also be attributed to\n      these labels.  [11] is an example of a related\
    \ set of labels based\n      on a specific characteristic.\n      However, the\
    \ mechanisms used to achieve a stated characteristic\n      MUST NOT be stated\
    \ in the definition of a label.  Local policy\n      determines mechanism(s) used\
    \ to achieve or support a specific\n      characteristic.  This allows for the\
    \ possibility of different\n      mechanisms to achieve the same stated characteristic.\n\
    \      The interaction between unrelated labels MUST NOT be embedded\n      within\
    \ the definition of a label.  Local policy states the actions\n      (if any)\
    \ to be taken if unrelated labeled traffic merges at a\n      node.\n      Finally,\
    \ labels may have additional characteristics added to them\n      as a result\
    \ of local policy.\n   4) Network Functionality\n      Functionality to support\
    \ a better than best effort SHOULD focus on\n      probability versus guarantees.\
    \  Probability can be realized in\n      terms of reduced probability of packet\
    \ loss, and/or minimal\n      jitter, and/or minimal end-to-end delay.  There\
    \ is NO requirement\n      that a better than best effort functionality MUST exist.\
    \  There is\n      NO requirement that if a better than best effort functionality\n\
    \      exists then it must be ubiquitous between end users.\n"
- title: 3.1.  General Security Related Requirements
  contents:
  - "3.1.  General Security Related Requirements\n   The following are security related\
    \ requirements that emerge given the\n   requirements 1 through 4 above.\n   5)\
    \ Authorization\n      Authorization is a method of validating that a user or\
    \ some\n      traffic is allowed by policy to use a particular service offering.\n\
    \      Mechanisms must be implemented so that only authorized users have\n   \
    \   access to emergency telecommunications services.  Any mechanism\n      for\
    \ providing such authorization beyond closed private networks\n      SHOULD meet\
    \ IETF Security Area criterion (e.g., clear-text\n      passwords would not generally\
    \ be acceptable).  Authorization\n      protects network resources from excessive\
    \ use, from abuse, and\n      might also support billing and accounting for the\
    \ offered service.\n      Such authorization mechanisms SHOULD be flexible enough\
    \ to provide\n      various levels of restriction and authorization depending\
    \ on the\n      expectations of a particular service or customer.\n   6) Integrity\
    \ & Authentication\n      In practice, authentication and integrity for IP based\n\
    \      communications are generally bound within a single mechanism, even\n  \
    \    though conceptually they are different.  Authentication ensures\n      that\
    \ the user or traffic is who it claims to be.  Integrity offers\n      assurance\
    \ that unauthorized modifications to objects can be\n      detected.\n      Authorized\
    \ emergency traffic needs to have reduced risk of adverse\n      impact from denial\
    \ of service.  This implies a need to ensure\n      integrity of the authorized\
    \ emergency network traffic.  It should\n      be noted, though, that mechanisms\
    \ used to ensure integrity can\n      also be subject to Denial of Service attacks.\n\
    \      Users of emergency network services SHOULD consider deploying\n      end-to-end\
    \ integrity and authentication, rather than relying on\n      services that might\
    \ be offered by any single provider of emergency\n      network services.  Users\
    \ SHOULD also carefully consider which\n      application-layer security services\
    \ might be appropriate to use.\n   7) Confidentiality\n      Some emergency communications\
    \ might have a requirement that they\n      not be susceptible to interception\
    \ or viewing by others, due to\n      the sensitive and urgent nature of emergency\
    \ response activities.\n      An emergency telecommunications service MAY offer\
    \ options to\n      provide confidentiality for certain authorized user traffic.\n\
    \      Consistent with other IETF standards and the Internet\n      Architecture,\
    \ this document recommends that IEPREP users SHOULD\n      deploy end-to-end security\
    \ mechanisms, rather than rely on\n      security services that might be offered\
    \ by a single network\n      operator.  IEPREP users SHOULD carefully consider\
    \ security\n      alternatives (e.g., PGP, TLS, IPsec transport-mode) at different\n\
    \      layers (e.g., Application Layer, Session Layer, Transport Layer)\n    \
    \  of the Internet Architecture before deployment.\n"
- title: 4.  Issues
  contents:
  - "4.  Issues\n   This section presents issues that arise in considering solutions\
    \ for\n   the requirements that have been defined for ETS.  This section does\n\
    \   not specify solutions nor is it to be confused with requirements.\n   Subsequent\
    \ documents that articulate a more specific set of\n   requirements for a particular\
    \ service may make a statement about the\n   following issues.\n   1) Accounting\n\
    \      Accounting represents a method of tracking actual usage of a\n      service.\
    \  We assume that the usage of any service better than best\n      effort will\
    \ be tracked and subsequently billed to the user.\n      Accounting is not addressed\
    \ as a general requirement for ETS.\n      However, solutions used to realize\
    \ ETS should not preclude an\n      accounting mechanism.\n   2) Admission Control\n\
    \      The requirements of section 3 discuss labels and security.  Those\n   \
    \   developing solutions should understand that the ability labels\n      provide\
    \ to distinguish emergency flows does not create an ability\n      to selectively\
    \ admit flows.  Admission control as it is commonly\n      understood in circuit-switched\
    \ networks is not present in IP-based\n      networks, and schemes which presume\
    \ the ability to selectively\n      admit flows when resources are scarce will\
    \ fail outside of very\n      controlled environments.  In cases where emergency\
    \ related flows\n      occur outside of controlled environments, the development\
    \ of\n      technologies based on admission control is not recommended as the\n\
    \      foundation of emergency services.\n   3) Digital Signatures\n      Verification\
    \ of digital signatures is computationally expensive.\n      If an operator acts\
    \ upon a label and hence needs to verify the\n      authenticity of the label,\
    \ then there is a potential denial-of-\n      service attack on the entity performing\
    \ the authentication.  The\n      DoS attack works by flooding the entity performing\
    \ the\n      authentication with invalid (i.e., not authentic) labelled\n    \
    \  information, causing the victim to spend excessive amounts of\n      computing\
    \ resources on signature validation.  Even though the\n      invalid information\
    \ might get discarded after the signature\n      validation fails, the adversary\
    \ has already forced the victim to\n      expend significant amounts of computing\
    \ resource.  Accordingly,\n      any system requiring such validation SHOULD define\
    \ operational and\n      protocol measures to reduce the vulnerability to such\
    \ a DoS\n      attack.\n"
