  contents:
  - "Abstract\n   This document describes a URN (Uniform Resource Name) namespace\
    \ for\n   identifying content resources within federated content collections.\n\
    \   A federated content collection often does not have a strong\n   centralized\
    \ authority but relies upon shared naming, metadata, and\n   access conventions\
    \ to provide interoperability among its members.\n"
- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   Federated content collections are often loose constructs\
    \ of both\n   small and large content providers, with an active community, but\n\
    \   without significant central authority.  Members are bound together by\n  \
    \ shared purpose and interoperate through shared naming, metadata, and\n   access\
    \ conventions.  Federations may also consist of other\n   federations, creating\
    \ complex associations and dependencies.\n   A content provider may join or leave\
    \ a federation at any time and may\n   be part of more than one federation at\
    \ the same time.  Content\n   providers may also cease as organizations altogether,\
    \ freeing their\n   domain names for use by others.  In addition, content identifiers\
    \ are\n   spread throughout the members of a federation.  These identifiers are\n\
    \   stored on various media, sometimes for long durations before being\n   used.\
    \  Therefore, although they work well in situations without a\n   strong content\
    \ naming authority, URLs are insufficient as content\n   identifiers within a\
    \ federation because they cannot be uniquely and\n   permanently tied to a specific\
    \ content resource.\n   This URN namespace provides a mechanism whereby a central\
    \ naming\n   authority is not required.  Providers maintain naming authority over\n\
    \   their own content within guidelines that guarantee URNs to be unique\n   and\
    \ permanent.\n   A simple identifier resolution convention is also recommended\
    \ to\n   provide a consistent URN resolver interface across all providers.\n \
    \  This namespace specification is for a formal namespace.\n"

    \   Declaration of syntactic structure:\n      The NSS has the following ABNF\
    \ [2] specification:\n      NSS         = ProviderId \":\" DateId \":\" ResourceId\n\
    \      ProviderId  = 1*(label \".\") toplabel\n      DateId      = (CCYY [MM [DD]])\
    \ / 1*3(DIGIT)\n      ResourceId  = 1*(alphanum / other / (\"%\" hex hex))\n \
    \     label       = alphanum / alphanum *(alphanum / \"-\") alphanum\n      toplabel\
    \    = ALPHA / ALPHA *(alphanum / \"-\") alphanum\n      CCYY        = 4(DIGIT)\n\
    \      MM          = (\"0\" %x31-39) / (\"1\" %x30-32)\n      DD          = (\"\
    0\" %x31-39) / (%x31-32 DIGIT) / \"30\" / \"31\"\n      alphanum    = ALPHA /\
    \ DIGIT\n      hex         = DIGIT / %x41-46 / %x61-66\n      other       = \"\
    (\" / \")\" / \"+\" / \",\" / \"-\" / \".\" / \":\" / \"=\" /\n              \
    \      \"@\" / \";\" / \"$\" / \"_\" / \"!\" / \"*\" / \"'\"\n      ProviderId\
    \ is the content provider's identifier.  ProviderId MUST\n      be an Internet\
    \ domain name and MUST be owned by the organization\n      creating the resource\
    \ and allocating the URN to the resource.\n      DateId is a date in ISO 8601\
    \ Basic Format (CCYY[MM[DD]]), and MUST\n      correspond to a specific day on\
    \ which the organization allocating\n      the URN owned the domain name specified\
    \ in the ProviderId.  If not\n      included, the default value for MM and DD\
    \ is \"01\".  DateIds of 1\n      to 3 digits are reserved.\n      ResourceId\
    \ MUST be unique among all ResourceIds emanating from the\n      same provider\
    \ and having the same DateId.\n   Relevant ancillary documentation:\n      None.\n\
    \   Identifier uniqueness considerations:\n      The combination of ProviderId\
    \ and DateId serves to uniquely\n      identify the organization that is allocating\
    \ the URN.  That\n      organization is responsible for ensuring the uniqueness\
    \ of the\n      ResourceId.\n   Identifier persistence considerations:\n     \
    \ A URN of this namespace may only be allocated by an organization\n      that\
    \ owns an Internet domain name.  The URN identifies a date on\n      which the\
    \ organization owned that domain name.  The combination of\n      domain name\
    \ and date will serve to uniquely identify that\n      organization for all time.\n\
    \   Process of identifier assignment:\n     The organization identified by the\
    \ ProviderId/DateId combination is\n     responsible for allocating a ResourceId\
    \ that is unique among all\n     those that it allocates with that DateId.\n \
    \  Process of identifier resolution:\n     Content providers are responsible for\
    \ the provision of a URN\n     resolution service, if any, for URNs they have\
    \ assigned with a\n     valid ProviderId/DateId combination.\n     Content providers\
    \ SHOULD support URN resolution by using the HTTP\n     protocol convention described\
    \ in RFC 2169 [3].  The ProviderId\n     SHOULD be used as the HTTP server location.\n\
    \   Rules for Lexical Equivalence:\n      In addition to the rules defined in\
    \ RFC 2141 [4], normalize the\n      case of the ProviderId to lower case before\
    \ comparison.\n   Conformance with URN Syntax:\n      There are no additional\
    \ characters reserved.\n   Validation mechanism:\n      None additional to resolution\
    \ specified.\n   Scope:\n      Global\n"

  contents:
  - "6.  Namespace Considerations\n   Distribution of naming authority, identifier\
    \ flexibility, and a\n   recommended URN resolution mechanism make this namespace\
    \ a unique and\n   valuable tool to meet the URN requirements of small content\
    \ providers\n   and federated content collections.\n"
- title: 7.  Community Considerations
  contents:
  - "7.  Community Considerations\n   By establishing a simple, flexible, and efficient\
    \ means for smaller\n   content providers to uniquely identify and publish their\
    \ content,\n   this namespace reduces the effort required for these providers\
    \ to\n   participate in federated collections.  A consistent identifier format\n\
    \   and resolution mechanism also increases the ability of federations to\n  \
    \ accept content references from smaller providers and to aggregate\n   themselves\
    \ into federations of federations.  Increased participation\n   and aggregation\
    \ results in a larger selection of distinctive content\n   that is more accessible\
    \ to the community.\n   To make use of this namespace, a content provider should\
    \ further\n   decompose the ResourceId portion of the namespace syntactic structure\n\
    \   to meet their internal content identification needs and establish an\n   internal\
    \ governance mechanism to ensure that all identifiers created\n   follow the requirements\
    \ of this namespace.  It is also recommended\n   that the identifier resolution\
    \ mechanism described in RFC 2169 [3] be\n   provisioned within an HTTP server\
    \ designated by the ProviderId\n   portion of the namespace syntactic structure.\n"
