- title: Abstract
  contents:
  - "Abstract\n   Software that handles electronic mailing list messages (servers\
    \ and\n   user agents) needs a way to reliably identify messages that belong to\n\
    \   a particular mailing list.  With the advent of list management\n   headers,\
    \ it has become even more important to provide a unique\n   identifier for a mailing\
    \ list regardless of the particular host that\n   serves as the list processor\
    \ at any given time.\n   The List-Id header provides a standard location for such\
    \ an\n   identifier.  In addition, a namespace for list identifiers based on\n\
    \   fully qualified domain names is described.  This namespace is\n   intended\
    \ to guarantee uniqueness for list owners who require it,\n   while allowing for\
    \ a less rigorous namespace for experimental and\n   personal use.\n   By including\
    \ the List-Id field, list servers can make it easier for\n   mail clients to provide\
    \ automated tools for users to perform list\n   functions.  The list identifier\
    \ can serve as a key to make many\n   automated processing tasks easier, and hence\
    \ more widely available.\n"
- title: 1. Introduction
  contents:
  - "1. Introduction\n   Internet mailing lists have evolved into fairly sophisticated\
    \ forums\n   for group communication and collaboration; however, corresponding\n\
    \   changes in the underlying infrastructure have lagged behind.  Recent\n   proposals\
    \ like [RFC2369] have expanded the functionality that the MUA\n   can provide\
    \ by providing more information in each message sent by the\n   mailing list distribution\
    \ software.\n   Actually implementing such functionality in the MUA depends on\
    \ the\n   ability to accurately identify messages as belonging to a particular\n\
    \   mailing list.  The problem then becomes what attribute or property to\n  \
    \ use to identify a mailing list.  The most likely candidate is the\n   submission\
    \ address of the mailing list itself.  Unfortunately, when\n   the list server\
    \ host, the list processing software, or the submission\n   policy of the list\
    \ changes the submission address itself can change.\n   This causes great difficulty\
    \ for automated processing and filtering.\n   In order to further automate (and\
    \ make more accurate) the processing\n   a software agent can do, there needs\
    \ to be some unique identifier to\n   use as an identifier for the mailing list.\
    \  This identifier can be\n   simply used for string matching in a filter, or\
    \ it can be used in\n   more sophisticated systems to uniquely identify messages\
    \ as belonging\n   to a particular mailing list independent of the particular\
    \ host\n   delivering the actual messages.  This identifier can also act as a\n\
    \   key into a database of mailing lists.\n   The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\"\
    , \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\"\
    , \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n   document are to be interpreted as described\
    \ in RFC 2119.\n"
- title: 2. The List Identifier Syntax
  contents:
  - "2. The List Identifier Syntax\n   The list identifier will, in most cases, appear\
    \ like a host name in a\n   domain of the list owner.  In other words, the domain\
    \ name system is\n   used to delegate namespace authority for list identifiers\
    \ just as it\n   has been used to distribute that authority for other internet\n\
    \   resources.\n   Using the domain name system as a basis for the list identifier\n\
    \   namespace is intended to leverage an existing authority structure\n   into\
    \ a new area of application.  By using the domain name system to\n   delegate\
    \ list identifier namespace authority, it becomes instantly\n   clear who has\
    \ the right to create a particular list identifier, and\n   separates the list\
    \ identifier from any particular delivery host or\n   mechanism.  Only the rights-holder\
    \ of a domain or subdomain has the\n   authority to create list identifiers in\
    \ the namespace of that domain.\n   For example, only the rights-holder to the\
    \ \"acm.org\" domain has the\n   authority to create list identifiers in \"acm.org\"\
    \ domain.\n   While it is perfectly acceptable for a list identifier to be\n \
    \  completely independent of the domain name of the host machine\n   servicing\
    \ the mailing list, the owner of a mailing list MUST NOT\n   generate list identifiers\
    \ in any domain namespace for which they do\n   not have authority.  For example,\
    \ a mailing list hosting service may\n   choose to assign list identifiers in\
    \ their own domain based\n   namespace, or they may allow their clients (the list\
    \ owners) to\n   provide list identifiers in a namespace for which the owner has\n\
    \   authority.\n   If the owner of the list does not have the authority to create\
    \ a list\n   identifier in a domain-based namespace, they may create unmanaged\n\
    \   list identifiers in the special unmanaged domain \"localhost\".  This\n  \
    \ would apply to personal users, or users unable to afford domain name\n   registration\
    \ fees.\n   The syntax for a list identifier in ABNF [RFC2234] follows:\n   list-id\
    \ = list-label \".\" list-id-namespace\n   list-label = dot-atom-text\n   list-id-namespace\
    \ = domain-name / unmanaged-list-id-namespace\n   unmanaged-list-id-namespace\
    \    = \"localhost\"\n   domain-name = dot-atom-text\n   Where:\n       dot-atom-text\
    \ is defined in [DRUMS]\n       \"localhost\" is a reserved domain name is defined\
    \ in [RFC2606]\n   In addition, a list identifier (list-id) MUST NOT be longer\
    \ than 255\n   octets in length, for future compatibility.  It should be noted\
    \ that\n   \"localhost\" is not valid for the domain-name rule.\n"
- title: 3. The List-Id Header Field
  contents:
  - "3. The List-Id Header Field\n   This document presents a header field which will\
    \ provide an\n   identifier for an e-mail distribution list.  This header SHOULD\
    \ be\n   included on all messages distributed by the list (including command\n\
    \   responses to individual users), and on other messages where the\n   message\
    \ clearly applies to this particular distinct list.  There MUST\n   be no more\
    \ than one of each field present in any given message.\n   This field MUST only\
    \ be generated by mailing list software, not end\n   users.\n   The contents of\
    \ the List-Id header mostly consist of angle-bracket\n   ('<', '>') enclosed identifier,\
    \ with internal whitespace being\n   ignored.  MTAs MUST NOT insert whitespace\
    \ within the brackets, but\n   client applications should treat any such whitespace,\
    \ that might be\n   inserted by poorly behaved MTAs, as characters to ignore.\n\
    \   The list header fields are subject to the encoding and character\n   restrictions\
    \ for mail headers as described in [RFC822].\n   The List-Id header MAY optionally\
    \ include a description by including\n   it as a \"phrase\" [DRUMS] before the\
    \ angle-bracketed list identifier.\n   The MUA MAY choose to use this description\
    \ in its user interface;\n   however, any MUA that intends to make use of the\
    \ description should\n   be prepared to properly parse and decode any encoded\
    \ strings or other\n   legal phrase components.  For many MUAs the parsing of\
    \ the List-Id\n   header will simply consist of extracting the list identifier\
    \ from\n   between the delimiting angle brackets.\n   The syntax of the List-Id\
    \ header follows:\n   list-id-header = \"List-ID:\" [phrase] \"<\" list-id \"\
    >\" CRLF\n   where phrase and CRLF are as defined in [DRUMS].  Unlike most headers\n\
    \   in [RFC822], the List-Id header does not allow free insertion of\n   whitespace\
    \ and comments around tokens.  Any descriptive text must be\n   presented in the\
    \ optional phrase component of the header.\n   Examples:\n"

- title: 4. Persistence of List Identifiers
  contents:
  - "4. Persistence of List Identifiers\n   Although the list identifier MAY be changed\
    \ by the mailing list\n   administrator this is not desirable.  (Note that there\
    \ is no\n   disadvantage to changing the description portion of the List-Id\n\
    \   header.)  A MUA may not recognize the change to the list identifier\n   because\
    \ the MUA SHOULD treat a different list identifier as a\n   different list.  As\
    \ such the mailing list administrator SHOULD avoid\n   changing the list identifier\
    \ even when the host serving the list\n   changes.  On the other hand, transitioning\
    \ from an informal\n   unmanaged-list-id-namespace to a domain namespace is an\
    \ acceptable\n   reason to change the list identifier.  Also if the focus of the\
    \ list\n   changes sufficiently the administrator may wish to retire the\n   previous\
    \ list and its associated identifier to start a new list\n   reflecting the new\
    \ focus.\n"
- title: 5. Uniqueness of List Identifiers
  contents:
  - "5. Uniqueness of List Identifiers\n   This proposal seeks to leverage the existing\
    \ administrative process\n   already in place for domain name allocation.  In\
    \ particular, we\n   exploit the fact that domain name ownership creates a namespace\
    \ that\n   by definition can be used to create unique identifiers within the\n\
    \   domain.\n   In addition, there must be a mechanism for identification of mailing\n\
    \   lists that are administrated by some entity without administrative\n   access\
    \ to a domain.  In this case, general heuristics can be given to\n   reduce the\
    \ chance of collision, but it cannot be guaranteed.  If a\n   list owner requires\
    \ a guarantee, they are free to register a domain\n   name under their control.\n\
    \   It is suggested, but not required, that list identifiers be created\n   under\
    \ a subdomain of \"list-id\" within any given domain.  This can\n   help to reduce\
    \ internal conflicts between the administrators of the\n   subdomains of large\
    \ organizations.  For example, list identifiers at\n   \"within.com\" are generated\
    \ in the subdomain of \"list-id.within.com\".\n   List-IDs not ending with \"\
    .localhost\" MUST be globally unique in\n   reference to all other mailing lists.\n\
    \   List owners wishing to use the special \"localhost\" namespace for\n   their\
    \ list identifier SHOULD use the month and year (in the form\n   MMYYYY) that\
    \ they create the list identifier as a \"subdomain\" of the\n   \"localhost\"\
    \ namespace.  In addition, some portion of the list\n   identifier MUST be a randomly\
    \ generated string.  List owners\n   generating such identifiers should refer\
    \ to [MSGID] for further\n   suggestions on generating a unique identifier, and\
    \ [RFC1750] for\n   suggestions on generating random numbers.  In particular,\
    \ list\n   identifiers that have a random component SHOULD contain a hex\n   encoding\
    \ of 128 bits of randomness (resulting in 32 hex characters)\n   as part of the\
    \ list identifier\n   Thus, list identifiers such as\n   <lenas-jokes.da39efc25c530ad145d41b86f7420c3b.021999.localhost>\
    \ and\n   <da39efc25c530ad145d41b86f7420c3b.051998.localhost> conform to these\n\
    \   guidelines, while <lenas-jokes.021999.localhost> and\n   <mylist.localhost>\
    \ do not.  A particular list owner with several\n   lists MAY choose to use the\
    \ same random number subdomain when\n   generating list identifiers for each of\
    \ the lists.\n   List-IDs ending with \".localhost\" are not guaranteed to be\
    \ globally\n   unique.\n"
- title: 6. Operations on List Identifiers
  contents:
  - "6. Operations on List Identifiers\n   There is only one operation defined for\
    \ list identifiers, that of\n   case insensitive equality (See Section 3.4.7.,\
    \ CASE INDEPENDENCE\n   [RFC822]).  The sole use of a list identifier is to identify\
    \ a\n   mailing list, and the sole use of the List-Id header is to mark a\n  \
    \ particular message as belonging to that list.  The comparison\n   operation\
    \ MUST ignore any part of the List-Id header outside of the\n   angle brackets,\
    \ the MUA MAY choose to inform the user if the\n   descriptive name of a mailing\
    \ list changes.\n"
- title: 7. Supporting Nested Lists
  contents:
  - "7. Supporting Nested Lists\n   A list that is a sublist for another list in a\
    \ nested mailing list\n   hierarchy MUST NOT modify the List-Id header field;\
    \ however, this\n   will only be possible when the nested mailing list is aware\
    \ of the\n   relationship between it and its \"parent\" mailing lists.  If a mailing\n\
    \   list processor encounters a List-Id header field from any unexpected\n   source\
    \ it SHOULD NOT pass it through to the list.  This implies that\n   mailing list\
    \ processors may have to be updated to properly support\n   List-Ids for nested\
    \ lists.\n"
- title: 8. Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "8. Security Considerations\n   There are very few new security concerns generated\
    \ with this\n   proposal.  Message headers are an existing standard, designed\
    \ to\n   easily accommodate new types.  There may be concern with headers\n  \
    \ being forged, but this problem is inherent in Internet e-mail, not\n   specific\
    \ to the header described in this document.  Further, the\n   implications are\
    \ relatively harmless.\n   As mentioned above, mail list processors SHOULD NOT\
    \ allow any user-\n   originated List-Id fields to pass through to their lists,\
    \ lest they\n   confuse the user and have the potential to create security problems.\n\
    \   On the client side, a forged list identifier may break automated\n   processing.\
    \  The list identifier (in its current form) SHOULD NOT be\n   used as an indication\
    \ of the authenticity of the message.\n"
