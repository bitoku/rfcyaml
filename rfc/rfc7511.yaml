  - "1.  Introduction\n   In times of Green IT, a lot of effort is put into reducing\
    \ the energy\n   consumption of routers, switches, servers, hosts, etc., to preserve\n\
    \   our environment.  This document looks at Green IT from a different\n   angle\
    \ and focuses on network packets being routed and switched around\n   the world.\n\
    \   Most likely, no one ever thought about the millions of packets being\n   disassembled\
    \ into bits every second and forced through copper wires\n   or being shot through\
    \ dark fiber lines by powerful lasers at\n   continuously increasing speeds. \
    \ Although RFC 5841 [RFC5841] provided\n   some thoughts about Packet Moods and\
    \ began to represent them as a TCP\n   option, this doesn't help the packets escape\
    \ their torturous routine.\n   This document defines another way to deal with\
    \ Green IT for traffic\n   and network engineers and will hopefully aid the wellbeing\
    \ of a\n   myriad of network packets around the world.  It proposes Scenic\n \
    \  Routing, which incorporates the green-ness of a network path into the\n   routing\
    \ decision.  A routing engine implementing Scenic Routing\n   should therefore\
    \ choose paths based on Avian IP Carriers [RFC1149]\n   and/or wireless technologies\
    \ so the packets will get out of the\n   miles/kilometers of dark fibers that\
    \ are in the ground and get as\n   much fresh-air time and sunlight as possible.\n\
    \   As of the widely known acceptance of the current version of the\n   Internet\
    \ Protocol (IPv6), this document only focuses on version 6 and\n   ignores communication\
    \ still based on Vintage IP [RFC791].\n"

- title: 6.  Related Work
  contents:
  - "6.  Related Work\n   As Scenic Routing is heavily dependent on network paths\
    \ and routing\n   information, it might be worth looking at designing extensions\
    \ for\n   popular routing protocols like BGP or OSPF to leverage the full\n  \
    \ potential of Scenic Routing in large networks built upon lots of\n   wireless\
    \ links and/or Avian IP Carriers.  When incorporating\n   information about links\
    \ compatible with Scenic Routing, the routing\n   algorithms could easily calculate\
    \ the optimal paths providing the\n   most fresh-air time for a packet for any\
    \ given destination.\n   This would even allow preference for wireless paths going\
    \ alongside\n   popular or culturally important places.  This way, the packets\
    \ don't\n   only avoid the dark fibers, but they get to see the world outside\
    \ of\n   the Internet and are exposed to different cultures around the globe,\n\
    \   which may help build an understanding of cultural differences and\n   promote\
    \ acceptance of these differences.\n"
