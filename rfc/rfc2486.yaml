- title: 2.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "2.  Introduction\n   Considerable interest has arisen recently in a set of features\
    \ that\n   fit within the general category of \"roaming capability\" for dialup\n\
    \   Internet users.  Interested parties have included:\n        Regional Internet\
    \ Service Providers (ISPs) operating within a\n        particular state or province,\
    \ looking to combine their efforts\n        with those of other regional providers\
    \ to offer dialup service\n        over a wider area.\n        National ISPs wishing\
    \ to combine their operations with those of\n        one or more ISPs in another\
    \ nation to offer more comprehensive\n        dialup service in a group of countries\
    \ or on a continent.\n        Businesses desiring to offer their employees a comprehensive\n\
    \        package of dialup services on a global basis.  Those services\n     \
    \   may include Internet access as well as secure access to\n        corporate\
    \ intranets via a Virtual Private Network (VPN), enabled\n        by tunneling\
    \ protocols such as PPTP, L2F, L2TP, and IPSEC tunnel\n        mode.\n   In order\
    \ to enhance the interoperability of roaming and tunneling\n   services, it is\
    \ desirable to have a standardized method for\n   identifying users.  This document\
    \ proposes syntax for the Network\n   Access Identifier (NAI).  Examples of implementations\
    \ that use the\n   NAI, and descriptions of its semantics, can be found in [1].\n"
- title: 2.1.  Terminology
  contents:
  - "2.1.  Terminology\n   This document frequently uses the following terms:\n  \
    \ Network Access Identifier\n             The Network Access Identifier (NAI)\
    \ is the userID submitted\n             by the client during PPP authentication.\
    \  In roaming, the\n             purpose of the NAI is to identify the user as\
    \ well as to\n             assist in the routing of the authentication request.\n\
    \             Please note that the NAI may not necessarily be the same as\n  \
    \           the user's e-mail address or the userID submitted in an\n        \
    \     application layer authentication.\n   Network Access Server\n          \
    \   The Network Access Server (NAS) is the device that clients\n             dial\
    \ in order to get access to the network. In PPTP\n             terminology this\
    \ is referred to as the PPTP Access\n             Concentrator (PAC), and in L2TP\
    \ terminology, it is referred\n             to as the L2TP Access Concentrator\
    \ (LAC).\n   Roaming Capability\n             Roaming capability can be loosely\
    \ defined as the ability to\n             use any one of multiple Internet service\
    \ providers (ISPs),\n             while maintaining a formal, customer-vendor\
    \ relationship\n             with only one. Examples of cases where roaming capability\n\
    \             might be required include ISP \"confederations\" and ISP-\n    \
    \         provided corporate network access support.\n   Tunneling Service\n \
    \            A tunneling service is any network service enabled by\n         \
    \    tunneling protocols such as PPTP, L2F, L2TP, and IPSEC\n             tunnel\
    \ mode.  One example of a tunneling service is secure\n             access to\
    \ corporate intranets via a Virtual Private Network\n             (VPN).\n"
- title: 2.2.  Requirements language
  contents:
  - "2.2.  Requirements language\n   In this document, the key words \"MAY\", \"MUST,\
    \ \"MUST NOT\", \"optional\",\n   \"recommended\", \"SHOULD\", and \"SHOULD NOT\"\
    , are to be interpreted as\n   described in [9].\n"
- title: 2.3.  Purpose
  contents:
  - "2.3.  Purpose\n   As described in [1], there are now a number of services implementing\n\
    \   dialup roaming, and the number of Internet Service Providers involved\n  \
    \ in roaming consortia is increasing rapidly.\n   In order to be able to offer\
    \ roaming capability, one of the\n   requirements is to be able to identify the\
    \ user's home authentication\n   server.  For use in roaming, this function is\
    \ accomplished via the\n   Network Access Identifier (NAI) submitted by the user\
    \ to the NAS in\n   the initial PPP authentication.  It is also expected that\
    \ NASes will\n   use the NAI as part of the process of opening a new tunnel, in\
    \ order\n   to determine the tunnel endpoint.\n"
- title: 2.4.  Notes for Implementors
  contents:
  - "2.4.  Notes for Implementors\n   As proposed in this document, the Network Access\
    \ Identifier is of the\n   form user@realm.  Please note that while the user portion\
    \ of the NAI\n   conforms to the BNF described in [5], the BNF of the realm portion\n\
    \   allows the realm to begin with a digit, which is not permitted by the\n  \
    \ BNF described in [4]. This change was made to reflect current\n   practice;\
    \ although not permitted by the BNF described in [4], FQDNs\n   such as 3com.com\
    \ are commonly used, and accepted by current software.\n   Please note that NAS\
    \ vendors may need to modify their devices so as\n   to support the NAI as described\
    \ in this document. Devices handling\n   NAIs MUST support an NAI length of at\
    \ least 72 octets.\n"

- title: 5.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "5.  Security Considerations\n   Since an NAI reveals the home affiliation of\
    \ a user, it may assist an\n   attacker in further probing the username space.\
    \ Typically this\n   problem is of most concern in protocols which transmit the\
    \ user name\n   in clear-text across the Internet, such as in RADIUS, described\
    \ in\n   [2] and [3].  In order to prevent snooping of the user name,\n   protocols\
    \ may use confidentiality services provided by IPSEC,\n   described in [8].\n"
- title: 6.  IANA Considerations
  contents:
  - "6.  IANA Considerations\n   This document defines a new namespace that will need\
    \ to be\n   administered, namely the NAI realm namespace. In order to to avoid\n\
    \   creating any new administrative procedures, administration of the NAI\n  \
    \ realm namespace will piggyback on the administration of the DNS\n   namespace.\n\
    \   NAI realm names are required to be unique and the rights to use a\n   given\
    \ NAI realm for roaming purposes are obtained coincident with\n   acquiring the\
    \ rights to use a particular fully qualified domain name\n   (FQDN).  Those wishing\
    \ to use an NAI realm name should first acquire\n   the rights to use the corresponding\
    \ FQDN. Using an NAI realm without\n   ownership of the corresponding FQDN creates\
    \ the possibility of\n   conflict and therefore is to be discouraged.\n   Note\
    \ that the use of an FQDN as the realm name does not imply use of\n   the DNS\
    \ for location of the authentication server or for\n   authentication routing.\
    \  Since to date roaming has been implemented\n   on a relatively small scale,\
    \ existing implementations typically\n   handle location of authentication servers\
    \ within a domain and perform\n   authentication routing based on local knowledge\
    \ expressed in proxy\n   configuration files. The implementations described in\
    \ [1] have not\n   found a need for use of DNS for location of the authentication\
    \ server\n   within a domain, although this can be accomplished via use of the\
    \ DNS\n   SRV record, described in [6].  Similarly, existing implementations\n\
    \   have not found a need for dynamic routing protocols, or propagation\n   of\
    \ global routing information.  Note also that there is no\n   requirement that\
    \ the NAI represent a valid email address.\n"
