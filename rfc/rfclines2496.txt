Abstract This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB) for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
In particular, it describes objects used for managing DS3 and E3 interfaces.
This document is a companion document with Definitions of Managed Objects for the DS0 (RFC 2494 [25]), DS1/E1/DS2/E2 (RFC 2495 [17]), and the work in progress SONET/SDH Interface Types.
This memo specifies a MIB module in a manner that is both compliant to the SNMPv2 SMI, and semantically identical to the peer SNMPv1 definitions.
The SNMP Management Framework presently consists of five major components:   An overall architecture, described in RFC 2271 [1].
Mechanisms for describing and naming objects and events for the purpose of management.
The first version of this Structure of Management Information (SMI) is called SMIv1 and described in STD 16, RFC 1155 [2], STD 16, RFC 1212 [3] and RFC 1215 [4].
The second version, called SMIv2, is described in RFC 1902 [5], RFC 1903 [6] and RFC 1904 [7].
Message protocols for transferring management information.
The first version of the SNMP message protocol is called SNMPv1 and described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [8].
A second version of the SNMP message protocol, which is not an Internet standards track protocol, is called SNMPv2c and described in RFC 1901 [9] and RFC 1906 [10].
The third version of the message protocol is called SNMPv3 and described in RFC 1906 [10], RFC 2272 [11] and RFC 2274 [12].
Protocol operations for accessing management information.
The first set of protocol operations and associated PDU formats is described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [8].
A second set of protocol operations and associated PDU formats is described in RFC 1905 [13].
A set of fundamental applications described in RFC 2273 [14] and the view based access control mechanism described in RFC 2275 [15].
Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed the Management Information Base or MIB.
Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the SMI.
This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2.
A MIB conforming to the SMIv1 can be produced through the appropriate translations.
The resulting translated MIB must be semantically equivalent, except where objects or events are omitted because no translation is possible (use of Counter64).
Some machine readable information in SMIv2 will be converted into textual descriptions in SMIv1 during the translation process.
However, this loss of machine readable information is not considered to change the semantics of the MIB.
The changes from RFC1407 are the following: (1)  The Fractional Table has been deprecated (2)  This document uses SMIv2
(3)  Values are given for ifTable and ifXTable (4)  Example usage of ifStackTable is included (5)  dsx3IfIndex has been deprecated (6)
The definition of valid intervals has been clarified for the case where the agent proxied for other devices.
In particular, the treatment of missing intervals has been clarified.
(7)  An inward loopback has been added.
(8)  Additional lineStatus bits have been added for Near End in Unavailable Signal State, Carrier Equipment Out of Service, DS@ Payload AIS, and DS@ Performance Threshold (9)
A read write line Length object has been added.
(10) Added a lineStatus last change, trap and enabler.
Textual Conventions for statistics objects have been used.
A new object, dsx3LoopbackStatus, has been introduced to reflect the loopbacks established on a DS3/E3 interface and the source to the requests.
dsx3LoopbackConfig continues to be the desired loopback state while dsx3LoopbackStatus reflects the actual state.
A dual loopback has been added to allow the setting of an inward loopback and a line loopback at the same time.
An object has been added to indicated whether or not this is a channelized DS3/E3.
A new object has been added to indicate which DS1 is to set for remote loopback.
These objects are used when the particular media being used to realize an interface is a DS3/E3 interface.
At present, this applies to these values of the ifType variable in the Internet standard MIB: ds3 (30)
The DS3 definitions contained herein are based on the DS3 specifications in ANSI T1.102 1987, ANSI T1.107 1988, ANSI T1.107a  1990, and ANSI T1.404 1989 [8,9,9a,10].
The E3 definitions contained herein are based on the E3 specifications in CCITT G.751 [12].
Use of ifTable for DS3 Layer
Only the ifGeneralGroup needs to be supported.
The value of the Circuit Identifier.
If no Circuit Identifier has been assigned this object should have an octet string with zero length.
See interfaces MIB [5] ifName
Set to true(1) normally, except for cases such as DS3/E3 over AAL1/ATM where false(2) is appropriate 2.2.
The assignment of the index values could for example be:
The ifStackTable is then used to show the relationships between the various DS3 interfaces.
If the CSU shelf is managed by itself by a local SNMP Agent, the situation would be identical, except the Ethernet and the 4 router interfaces are deleted.
Interfaces would also be numbered from 1 to 8.
Usage of Channelization for DS3, DS1
An example is given here to explain the channelization objects in the DS3, DS1, and DS0 MIBs to help the implementor use the objects correctly.
Treatment of E3 and E1 would be similar, with the number of DS0s being different depending on the framing of the E1.
Assume that a DS3 (with ifIndex 1) is Channelized into DS1s (without DS2s).
The object dsx3Channelization is set to enabledDs1.
When this object is set to enabledDS1, 28 ifEntries of type DS1 will be created by the agent.
If dsx3Channelization is set to disabled, then the DS1s are destroyed.
Assume the entries in the ifTable for the DS1s are created in channel order and the ifIndex values are 2 through 29.
In the DS1 MIB, there will be an entry in the dsx1ChanMappingTable for each ds1.
The entries will be as follows: dsx1ChanMappingTable
In addition, the DS1s are channelized into DS0s.
The object dsx1Channelization is set to enabledDS0 for each DS1.
There will be 24 DS0s in the ifTable for each DS1.
Assume the entries in the ifTable are created in channel order and the ifIndex values for the DS0s in the first DS1 are 30 through 53.
In the DS0 MIB, there will be an entry in the dsx0ChanMappingTable for each DS0.
The entries will be as follows: dsx0ChanMappingTable
Usage of Channelization for DS3, DS2, DS1
An example is given here to explain the channelization objects in the DS3 and DS1 MIBs to help the implementor use the objects correctly.
Assume that a DS3 (with ifIndex 1) is Channelized into DS2s.
The object dsx3Channelization is set to enabledDs2.
There will be 7 DS2s (ifType of DS1) in the ifTable.
Assume the entries in the ifTable for the DS2s are created in channel order and the ifIndex values are 2 through 8.
In the DS1 MIB, there will be an entry in the dsx1ChanMappingTable for each DS2.
The entries will be as follows: dsx1ChanMappingTable
In addition, the DS2s are channelized into DS1s.
The object dsx1Channelization is set to enabledDS1 for each DS2.
There will be 4 DS1s in the ifTable for each DS2.
Assume the entries in the ifTable are created in channel order and the ifIndex values for the DS1s in the first DS2 are 9 through 12, then 13 through 16 for the second DS2, and so on.
In the DS1 MIB, there will be an entry in the dsx1ChanMappingTable for each DS1.
The entries will be as follows: dsx1ChanMappingTable
This section discusses the behaviour of objects related to loopbacks.
The object dsx3LoopbackConfig represents the desired state of loopbacks on this interface.
Using this object a Manager can request:
LineLoopback PayloadLoopback (if ESF framing)
The remote end can also request lookbacks either through the FDL channel if ESF or inband if D4.
The loopbacks that can be request this way are: LineLoopback PayloadLoopback (if ESF framing)
To model the current state of loopbacks on a DS3 interface, the object dsx3LoopbackStatus defines which loopback is currently applies to an interface.
This objects, which is a bitmap, will have bits turned on which reflect the currently active loopbacks on the interface as well as the source of those loopbacks.
The following restrictions/rules apply to loopbacks:
The far end cannot undo loopbacks set by a manager.
A manager can undo loopbacks set by the far end.
Both a line loopback and an inward loopback can be set at the same time.
Only these two loopbacks can co exist and either one may be set by the manager or the far end.
A LineLoopback request from the far end is incremental to an existing Inward loopback established by a manager.
When a NoLoopback is received from the far end in this case, the InwardLoopback remains in place.
Objectives of this MIB Module There are numerous things that could be included in a MIB for DS3/E3 signals:  the management of multiplexors, CSUs, DSUs, and the like.
The intent of this document is to facilitate the common management of all devices with DS3/E3 interfaces.
As such, a design decision was made up front to very closely align the MIB with the set of objects that can generally be read from DS3/E3 devices that are currently deployed.
The terminology used in this document to describe error conditions on a DS3 interface as monitored by a DS3 device are based on the late but not final draft of what became the ANSI T1.231 standard [11].
If the definition in this document does not match the definition in the ANSI T1.231 document, the implementer should follow the definition described in this document.
Error Events Bipolar Violation (BPV) Error Event
A bipolar violation error event, for B3ZS(HDB3) coded signals, is the occurrence of a pulse of the same polarity as the previous pulse without being part of the zero substitution code, B3ZS(HDB3).
For B3ZS(HDB3) coded signals, a bipolar violation error event may also include other error patterns such as:  three(four) or more consecutive zeros and incorrect polarity.
Excessive Zeros (EXZ) Error Event
An EXZ is the occurrence of any zero string length equal to or greater than 3 for B3ZS, or greater than 4 for HDB3.
This parameter is a count of both BPVs and EXZs occurring over the accumulation period.
An EXZ increments the LCV by one regardless of the length of the zero string.
(Also known as CV L.
P bit Coding Violation (PCV) Error Event For all DS3 applications, a coding violation error event is a P bit Parity Error event.
A P bit Parity Error event is the occurrence of a received P bit code on the DS3 M frame that is not identical to the corresponding locally  calculated code.
C bit Coding Violation (CCV)
For C bit Parity and SYNTRAN DS3 applications, this is the count of coding violations reported via the C bits.
For C bit Parity, it is a count of CP bit parity errors occurring in the accumulation interval.
For SYNTRAN, it is a count of CRC 9 errors occurring in the accumulation interval.
Performance Parameters All performance parameters are accumulated in fifteen minute intervals and up to 96 intervals (24 hours worth) are kept by an agent.
Fewer than 96 intervals of data will be available if the agent has been restarted within the last 24 hours.
In addition, there is a rolling 24 hour total of each performance parameter.
There is no requirement for an agent to ensure fixed relationship between the start of a fifteen minute interval and any wall clock; however some agents may align the fifteen minute intervals with quarter hours.
Performance parameters are of types PerfCurrentCount, PerfIntervalCount and PerfTotalCount.
These textual conventions are all Gauge32, and they are used because it is possible for these objects to decrease.
Objects may decrease when Unavailable Seconds occurs across a fifteen minutes interval boundary.
See Unavailable Seconds discussion later in this section.
Errored Second is a second in which one or more CV occurred OR one or more LOS defects.
(Also known as ES L. See T1.231 section 7.4.1.2) P bit Errored Seconds (PES)
An PES is a second with one or more PCVs OR one or more Out of Frame defects OR a detected incoming AIS.
This gauge is not incremented when UASs are counted.
(Also known as ESP P. See T1.231 section 7.4.2.2)
A PSES is a second with 44 or more PCVs OR one or more Out of Frame defects OR a detected incoming AIS.
This gauge is not incremented when UASs are counted.
(Also known as SESP P. See T1.231 section 7.4.2.5)
C bit Errored Seconds (CES)
An CES is a second with one or more CCVs OR one or more Out of Frame defects OR a detected incoming AIS.
This count is only for the SYNTRAN and C bit Parity DS3 applications.
This gauge is not incremented when UASs are counted.
(Also known as ESCP P. See T1.231 section 7.4.2.2)
A CSES is a second with 44 or more CCVs OR one or more Out of Frame defects OR a detected incoming AIS.
This count is only for the SYNTRAN and C bit Parity DS3 applications.
This gauge is not incremented when UASs are counted.
(Also known as SESCP P. See T1.231 section 7.4.2.5)
Severely Errored Framing Seconds (SEFS)
A SEFS is a second with one or more Out of Frame defects OR a detected incoming AIS.
This item is not incremented during unavailable seconds.
(Also known as SAS P. See T1.231 section 7.4.2.6)
(UAS) UAS are calculated by counting the number of seconds that the interface is unavailable.
The DS3 interface is said to be unavailable from the onset of 10 contiguous PSESs, or the onset of the condition leading to a failure (see Failure States).
If the condition leading to the failure was immediately preceded by one or more contiguous PSESs, then the DS3 interface unavailability starts from the onset of these PSESs.
Once unavailable, and if no failure is present, the DS3 interface becomes available at the onset of 10 contiguous seconds with no PSESs.
Once unavailable, and if a failure is present, the DS3 interface becomes available at the onset of 10 contiguous seconds with no PSESs, if the failure clearing time is less than or equal to 10 seconds.
If the failure clearing time is more than 10 seconds, the DS3 interface becomes available at the onset of 10 contiguous seconds with no PSESs, or the onset period leading to the successful clearing condition, whichever occurs later.
With respect to the DS3 error counts, all counters are incremented while the DS3 interface is deemed available.
While the interface is deemed unavailable, the only count that is incremented is UASs.
Note that this definition implies that the agent cannot determine until after a ten second interval has passed whether a given one second interval belongs to available or unavailable time.
If the agent chooses to update the various performance statistics in real time then it must be prepared to retroactively reduce the PES, PSES, CES, and CSES counts by 10 and increase the UAS count by 10 when it determines that available time has been entered.
It must also be prepared to adjust the PCV, CCV, and SEFS count as necessary since these parameters are not accumulated during unavailable time.
It must be similarly prepared to retroactively decrease the UAS count by 10 and increase the PES, CES, PCV, and CCV counts as necessary upon entering available time.
A special case exists when the 10 second period leading to available or unavailable time crosses a 900 second statistics window boundary, as the foregoing description implies that the PCV, CCV, PES, CES, PSES, CSEC, SEFS, and UAS counts for the PREVIOUS interval must be adjusted.
In this case successive GETs of the affected dsx3IntervalPSESs and dsx3IntervalUASs objects will return differing values if the first GET occurs during the first few seconds of the window.
The agent may instead choose to delay updates to the various statistics by 10 seconds in order to avoid retroactive adjustments to the counters.
A way to do this is sketched in Appendix B.
In any case, a linkDown trap shall be sent only after the agent has determined for certain that the unavailable state has been entered, but the time on the trap will be that of the first UAS (i.e., 10 seconds earlier).
A linkUp trap shall be handled similarly.
According to ANSI T1.231 unavailable time begins at the  onset  of 10 contiguous severely errored seconds
that is, unavailable time starts with the  first  of the 10 contiguous SESs.
Also, while an interface is deemed unavailable all counters for that interface are frozen except for the UAS count.
It follows that an implementation which strictly complies with this standard must  not  increment any counters other than the UAS count   even temporarily   as a result of anything that happens during those 10 seconds.
Since changes in the signal state lag the data to which they apply by 10 seconds, an ANSI compliant implementation must pass the the one second statistics through a 10 second delay line prior to updating any counters.
That can be done by performing the following steps at the end of each one second interval.
Read near/far end CV counter and alarm status flags from the hardware.
the CV counts for the preceding second and compare them to the ES and SES threshold for the layer in question.
Update the signal state and shift the one second CV counts and ES/SES flags into the 10 element delay line.
Note that far end one second statistics are to be flagged as "absent" during any second in which there is an incoming defect at the layer in question or at any lower layer.
iii) Update the current interval statistics using the signal state from the  previous  update cycle and the one second CV counts and ES/SES flags shifted out of the 10 element delay line.
This approach is further described in Appendix B. 2.4.3.
Performance Defects Failure States: The Remote Alarm Indication (RAI) failure, in SYNTRAN applications, is declared after detecting the Yellow Alarm Signal on the alarm channel.
The Remote Alarm Indication failure, in C bit Parity DS3 applications, is declared as soon as the presence of either one or two alarm signals are detected on the Far End Alarm Channel.
The Remote Alarm Indication failure may also be declared after detecting the far end SEF/AIS defect (aka yellow).
The Remote Alarm Indication failure is cleared as soon as the presence of the any of the above alarms are removed.
Also, the incoming failure state is declared when a defect persists for at least 2 10 seconds.
The defects are the following:  Loss of Signal (LOS), an Out of Frame (OOF) or an incoming Alarm Indication Signal (AIS).
The Failure State is cleared when the defect is absent for less than or equal to 20 seconds.
A Far End SEF/AIS defect is the occurrence of the two X bits in a M frame set to zero.
The Far End SEF/AIS defect is terminated when the two X bits in a M frame are set to one.
(Also known as SASCP PFE.
Out of Frame (OOF) defect A DS3 OOF defect is detected when any three or more errors in sixteen or fewer consecutive F bits occur within a DS3 M  frame.
An OOF defect may also be called a Severely Errored Frame (SEF) defect.
An OOF defect is cleared when reframe occurs.
A DS3 Loss of Frame (LOF) failure is declared when the DS3 OOF defect is consistent for 2 to 10 seconds.
The DS3 OOF defect ends when reframe occurs.
The DS3 LOF failure is cleared when the DS3 OOF defect is absent for 10 to 20 seconds.
An E3 OOF defect is detected when four consecutive frame alignment signals have been incorrectly received in there predicted positions in an E3 signal.
E3 frame alignment occurs when the presence of three consecutive frame alignment signals have been detected.
Loss of Signal (LOS) defect
Alarm Indication Signal (AIS) defect
The DS3 AIS is framed with "stuck stuffing."
This implies that it has a valid M subframe alignments bits, M frame alignment bits, and P bits.
The information bits are set to a 1010...
sequence, starting with a one (1) after each M  subframe alignment bit, M frame alignment bit, X bit, P bit, and C bit.
The C bits are all set to zero giving what is called "stuck stuffing."
The X bits are set to one.
The DS3 AIS defect is declared after DS3 AIS is present in contiguous M frames for a time equal to or greater than T, where 0.2 ms <  T <  100 ms.
The DS3 AIS defect is terminated after AIS is absent in contiguous M frames for a time equal to or greater than T.
The E3 binary content of the AIS is nominally a continuous stream of ones.
AIS detection and the application of consequent actions, should be completed within a time limit of 1 ms. 2.4.4.
This is a character string specified by the circuit vendor, and is useful when communicating with the vendor during the troubleshooting process.
In this document, the word proxy is meant to indicate an application which receives SNMP messages and replies to them on behalf of the devices which implement the actual DS3/E3 interfaces.
The proxy may have already collected the information about the DS3/E3 interfaces into its local database and may not necessarily forward the requests to the actual DS3/E3 interface.
It is expected in such an application that there are periods of time where the proxy is not communicating with the DS3/E3 interfaces.
In these instances the proxy will not necessarily have up to date configuration information and will most likely have missed the collection of some statistics data.
Missed statistics data collection will result in invalid data in the interval table.

"This table is deprecated in favour of using ifStackTable.
Implementation of this table was optional.
It was designed for those systems dividing a DS3/E3 into channels containing different data streams that are of local interest.
The DS3/E3 fractional table identifies which DS3/E3 channels associated with a CSU are being used to support a logical interface, i.e., an entry in the interfaces table from the Internet  standard MIB.
For example, consider a DS3 device with 4 high speed links carrying router traffic, a feed for voice, a feed for video, and a synchronous channel for a non routed protocol.
We might describe the allocation of channels, in the dsx3FracTable, as follows:
For dsx3M23, dsx3 SYNTRAN, dsx3CbitParity, and dsx3ClearChannel  there are 28 legal channels, numbered 1 throug h 28.
For e3Framed there are 16 legal channels, numbered 1 through 16.
The channels (1..16) correspond directly to the equivalently numbered time slots."

Appendix A Use of dsx3IfIndex and dsx3LineIndex This Appendix exists to document the previous use if dsx3IfIndex and dsx3LineIndex and to clarify the relationship of dsx3LineIndex as defined in rfc1407 with the dsx3LineIndex as defined in this document.
The following shows the old and new definitions and the relationship: [New Definition]: "This object should be made equal to ifIndex.
The next paragraph describes its previous usage.
Making the object equal to ifIndex allows proper use of ifStackTable.
[Old Definition]: "this object is the identifier of a DS3/E3 Interface on a managed device.
If there is an ifEntry that is directly associated with this and only this DS3/E3 interface, it should have the same value as ifIndex.
Otherwise, number the dsx3LineIndices with an unique identifier following the rules of choosing a number that is greater than ifNumber and numbering the inside interfaces (e.g., equipment side) with even numbers and outside interfaces (e.g, network side) with odd numbers.
" When the "Old Definition" was created, my understanding was that it was described this way to allow a manager to treat the value  as if  it were and
ifIndex, i.e. the value would either be:  1) an ifIndex value or 2)
a value that was guaranteed to be different from all valid ifIndex values.
The new definition is a subset of that definition, i.e. the value is always an ifIndex value.
The following is Section 3.1 from rfc1407:
Different physical configurations for the support of SNMP with DS3/E3 equipment exist.
To accommodate these scenarios, two different indices for DS3/E3 interfaces are introduced in this MIB.
These indices are dsx3IfIndex and dsx3LineIndex.
External interface scenario: the SNMP Agent represents all managed DS3/E3 lines as external interfaces (for example, an Agent residing on the device supporting DS3/E3 interfaces directly): For this scenario, all interfaces are assigned an integer value equal to ifIndex, and the following applies:
ifIndex dsx3IfIndex dsx3LineIndex for all interfaces.
The dsx3IfIndex column of the DS3/E3 Configuration table relates each DS3/E3 interface to its corresponding interface (ifIndex) in the Internet standard MIB
(MIB II STD 17, RFC1213).
interface scenario: the SNMP Agents resides on an host external from the device supporting DS3/E3 interfaces (e.g., a router).
The Agent represents both the host and the DS3/E3 device.
The index dsx3LineIndex is used to not only represent the DS3/E3 interfaces external from the host/DS3/E3 device combination, but also the DS3/E3 interfaces connecting the host and the DS3/E3 device.
The index dsx3IfIndex is always equal to ifIndex.
A shelf full of CSUs connected to a Router.
An SNMP Agent residing on the router proxies for itself and the CSU.
For this example, ifNumber is equal to 5.
Note the following description of dsx3LineIndex:  the dsx3LineIndex identifies a DS3/E3 Interface on a managed device.
If there is an ifEntry that is directly associated with this and only this DS3/E3 interface, it should have the same value as ifIndex.
Otherwise, number the dsx3LineIndices with an unique identifier following the rules of choosing a number greater than ifNumber and numbering inside interfaces (e.g., equipment side) with even numbers and outside interfaces (e.g, network side) with odd numbers.
The delay approach to Unavialable Seconds.
This procedure is illustrated below for a DS3 C Bit parity application.
Similar rules would apply for other interfaces covered by this MIB.
The procedure guarantees that the statistical counters are correctly updated at all times, although they lag real time by 10 seconds.
At the end of each 15 minutes interval the current interval counts are transferred to the  most recent interval entry and each interval is shifted up by one position, with the oldest being discarded if necessary in order to make room.
The current interval counts then start over from zero.
Note, however, that the signal state calculation does not start afresh at each interval boundary; rather, signal state information is retained across interval boundaries.
V    V    V    V   V   V   V    V    V   V
Note that if such a procedure is adopted there is no current interval data for the first ten seconds after a system comes up.
noSuchInstance must be returned if a management station attempts to access the current interval counters during this time.
It is an implementation specific matter whether an agent assumes that the initial state of the interface is available or unavailable.
Security Considerations SNMPv1 by itself is such an insecure environment.
Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec), even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is allowed to access and GET (read)
the objects in this MIB.
It is recommended that the implementors consider the security features as provided by the SNMPv3 framework.
Specifically, the use of the User based Security Model RFC 2274 [12] and the View based Access Control Model RFC 2275
It is then a customer/user responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an instance of this MIB, is properly configured to give access to those objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate rights to access them.
Setting any of the following objects to an inappropriate value can cause loss of traffic.
The definition of inappropriate varies for each object.
In the case of dsx3LineType, for example, both ends of a ds3/e3 must have the same value in order for traffic to flow.
In the case of dsx3SendCode and dsx3LoopbackConfig, for another example, traffic may stop transmitting when particular loopbacks are applied.
Setting the following object is mischevious, but not harmful to
traffic dsx3CircuitIdentifier Setting the following object can cause an increase in the number of traps received by the network management station.
