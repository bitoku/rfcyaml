- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   BGP routing security issues need to be addressed in order\
    \ to make the\n   Internet more stable.  Route leaks [RFC7908] are part of the\
    \ problem,\n   but software defects or operator misconfiguration can also\n  \
    \ contribute.  This document updates [RFC4271] so that routes are\n   neither\
    \ imported nor exported unless specifically enabled by\n   configuration.  This\
    \ change reduces the consequences of these\n   problems and improves the default\
    \ level of Internet routing security.\n   Many deployed BGP speakers send and\
    \ accept any and all route\n   announcements between their BGP neighbors by default.\
    \  This practice\n   dates back to the early days of the Internet, where operators\
    \ were\n   permissive in sending routing information to allow all networks to\n\
    \   reach each other.  As the Internet has become more densely\n   interconnected,\
    \ the risk of a misbehaving BGP speaker poses\n   significant risks to Internet\
    \ routing.\n   This specification intends to improve this situation by requiring\
    \ the\n   explicit configuration of both BGP Import and Export Policies for any\n\
    \   External BGP (EBGP) session such as customers, peers, or\n   confederation\
    \ boundaries for all enabled address families.  Through\n   codification of the\
    \ aforementioned requirement, operators will\n   benefit from consistent behavior\
    \ across different BGP\n   implementations.\n   BGP speakers following this specification\
    \ do not use or send routes\n   on EBGP sessions, unless specifically configured\
    \ to do so.\n"
- title: 2.  Terminology
  contents:
  - "2.  Terminology\n   [RFC4271] describes a Policy Information Base (PIB) that\
    \ contains\n   local policies that can be applied to the information in the Routing\n\
    \   Information Base (RIB).  This document distinguishes the type of a\n   policy\
    \ based on its application.\n   Import Policy: a local policy to be applied to\
    \ the information\n   contained in the Adj-RIBs-In.  As described in Section 3.2\
    \ [RFC4271],\n   the Adj-RIBs-In contain information learned from other BGP speakers,\n\
    \   and the application of the Import Policy results in the routes that\n   will\
    \ be considered in the Decision Process by the local BGP speaker.\n   Export Policy:\
    \ a local policy to be applied in selecting the\n   information contained in the\
    \ Adj-RIBs-Out.  As described in\n   Section 3.2 [RFC4271], the Adj-RIBs-Out contain\
    \ information that has\n   been selected for advertisement to other BGP speakers.\n"

    , \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"\
    NOT RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and\n   \"OPTIONAL\" in this document are to be interpreted\
    \ as described in\n   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear\
    \ in all\n   capitals, as shown here.\n"
- title: 3.  Changes to RFC 4271
  contents:
  - "3.  Changes to RFC 4271\n   This section updates [RFC4271] to specify the default\
    \ behavior of a\n   BGP speaker when there are no Import or Export Policies associated\n\
    \   with a particular EBGP session.  A BGP speaker MAY provide a\n   configuration\
    \ option to deviate from the following updated behaviors.\n   The following paragraph\
    \ is added to Section 9.1 (Decision Process)\n   after the fifth paragraph, which\
    \ ends in \"route aggregation and route\n   information reduction\":\n      Routes\
    \ contained in an Adj-RIB-In associated with an EBGP peer\n      SHALL NOT be\
    \ considered eligible in the Decision Process if no\n      explicit Import Policy\
    \ has been applied.\n   The following paragraph is added to Section 9.1.3 (Phase\
    \ 3: Route\n   Dissemination) after the third paragraph, which ends in \"by means\
    \ of\n   an UPDATE message (see 9.2).\":\n      Routes SHALL NOT be added to an\
    \ Adj-RIB-Out associated with an\n      EBGP peer if no explicit Export Policy\
    \ has been applied.\n"
- title: 4.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "4.  Security Considerations\n   Permissive default routing policies can result\
    \ in inadvertent effects\n   such as route leaks [RFC7908], in general resulting\
    \ in routing of\n   traffic through an unexpected path.  While it is possible\
    \ for an\n   operator to use monitoring to detect unexpected flows, there is no\n\
    \   general framework that can be applied.  These policies also have the\n   potential\
    \ to expose software defects or misconfiguration that could\n   have unforeseen\
    \ technical and business impacting effects.\n   The update to [RFC4271] specified\
    \ in this document is intended to\n   eliminate those inadvertent effects.  Operators\
    \ must explicitly\n   configure Import and Export Policies to achieve their expected\
    \ goals.\n   There is of course no protection against a malicious or incorrect\n\
    \   explicit configuration.\n   The security considerations described in [RFC4271]\
    \ and the\n   vulnerability analysis discussed in [RFC4272] also apply to this\n\
    \   document.\n"

- title: A.1.  "N+1 N+2" Release Strategy
  contents:
  - "A.1.  \"N+1 N+2\" Release Strategy\n   An implementer could leverage an approach\
    \ described as the \"N+1 and\n   N+2\" release strategy.  In release N+1, the\
    \ implementer introduces a\n   new default configuration parameter to indicate\
    \ that the BGP speaker\n   is operating in \"ebgp insecure-mode\".  In addition\
    \ to the\n   introduction of the new parameter, an implementer could begin to\n\
    \   display informational warnings to the operator that certain parts of\n   the\
    \ configuration are incomplete.  In release N+1, operators of the\n   BGP implementation\
    \ become aware that a configurable default exists in\n   the implementation, and\
    \ can prepare accordingly.  In release N+2 or\n   later, the inverse of the previous\
    \ default configuration parameter\n   that was introduced in release N+1 becomes\
    \ the new default.\n   As a result, any new installation of release N+2 will adhere\
    \ to this\n   document.  Installations upgraded from version release N+1 will\n\
    \   adhere to the previous insecure behavior, if no modification was made\n  \
    \ to the \"ebgp insecure-mode\" configuration parameter.\n"
