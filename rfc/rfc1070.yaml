- title: Introduction
  contents:
  - "Introduction\n   Since the International Organization for Standardization (ISO)\
    \ Open\n   Systems Interconnection (OSI) network layer protocols are in their\n\
    \   infancy, both interest in their development and concern for their\n   potential\
    \ impact on internetworking are widespread.  This interest\n   has grown substantially\
    \ with the introduction of the US Government\n   OSI Profile (GOSIP), which mandates,\
    \ for the US Government, the use\n   of OSI products in the near future.  The\
    \ OSI network layer protocols\n   have not yet received significant experimentation\
    \ and testing.  The\n   status of the protocols in the OSI network layer varies\
    \ from ISO\n   International Standard to \"contribution\" (not yet a Draft Proposal).\n\
    \   We believe that thorough testing of the protocols and implementations\n  \
    \ of the protocols should take place concurrently with the progression\n   of\
    \ the protocols to ISO standards.  For this reason, the creation of\n   an environment\
    \ for experimentation with these protocols is timely.\n   Thorough testing of\
    \ network and transport layer protocols for\n   internetworking requires a large,\
    \ varied, and complex environment.\n   While an implementor of the OSI protocols\
    \ may of course test an\n   implementation locally, few implementors have the\
    \ resources to create\n   a sufficiently large dynamic topology in which to test\
    \ the protocols\n   and implementations well.\n   One way to create such an environment\
    \ is to implement the OSI network\n   layer protocols in the existing routers\
    \ in an existing internetwork.\n   This solution is likely to be disruptive due\
    \ to the immature state of\n   the OSI network layer protocols and implementations,\
    \ coupled with the\n   fact that a large set of routers would have to implement\
    \ the OSI\n   network layer in order to do realistic testing.\n   This memo suggests\
    \ a scenario that will make it easy for implementors\n   to test with other implementors,\
    \ exploiting the existing connectivity\n   of the Internet without disturbing\
    \ existing gateways.\n   The method suggested is to treat the Internet as a subnetwork,\n\
    \   hereinafter called the \"IP subnet.\"  We do this by encapsulating OSI\n \
    \  connectionless network layer protocol (ISO 8473) packets in IP\n   datagrams,\
    \ where IP refers to the Internet network layer protocol,\n   RFC 791.  This encapsulation\
    \ occurs only with packets travelling over\n   the IP subnet to sites not reachable\
    \ over a local area network.  The\n   intent is for implementations to use OSI\
    \ network layer protocols\n   directly over links locally, and to use the IP subnet\
    \ as a link only\n   when necessary to reach a site that is separated from the\
    \ source by\n   an IP gateway.  While it is true that almost any system at a\n\
    \   participating site may be reachable with IP, it is expected that\n   experimenters\
    \ will configure their systems so that a subset of their\n   systems will consider\
    \ themselves to be directly connected to the IP\n   subnet for the purpose of\
    \ testing the OSI network layer protocols or\n   their implementations.  The proposed\
    \ scheme permits systems to change\n   their topological relationship to the IP\
    \ subnet at any time, also to\n   change their behavior as an end system (ES),\
    \ intermediate system\n   (IS), or both at any time.  This flexibility is necessary\
    \ to test the\n   dynamic adaptive properties of the routing exchange protocols.\n\
    \   A variant of this scheme is proposed for implementors who do not have\n  \
    \ direct access to the IP layer in their systems.  This variation uses\n   the\
    \ User Datagram Protocol over IP (UDP/IP) as the subnetwork.\n   In this memo\
    \ we will call the experiment based on the IP subnet EON,\n   an acronym for \"\
    Experimental OSI-based Network\".  We will call the\n   experiment based on the\
    \ UDP/IP subnet EON-UDP.\n   It is assumed that the reader is familiar with the\
    \ OSI connectionless\n   network layer and, in particular, with the following\
    \ documents:\n   RFC 768\n      User Datagram Protocol.\n   RFC 791\n      Internet\
    \ Protocol.\n   ISO 8473\n      Protocol for Providing the Connectionless mode\
    \ Network Service.\n   ISO DP 9542\n      End System to Intermediate System Routing\

    \   The mapping between NSAP-addresses and SNPA-addresses (Internet\n   addreses)\
    \ on the proposed IP subnet is straightforward.  The SNPA-\n   address is embeded\
    \ in the NSAP-address.\n   There are several ways in which the LOC-AREA field\
    \ could be used.\n   (1) Assign local areas, administered by the Internet Assigned\
    \ Numbers\n       Authority (IANA).  The advantage of this is that it permits\n\
    \       experimentation with area routing.  The disadvantage is that it\n    \
    \   will require an additional directory service to map host names to\n      \
    \ NSAP-addresses.  We would like to use the existing domain name\n       servers\
    \ to derive Internet addresses from names, and we would\n       like NSAP-addresses\
    \ to be derivable from the Internet addresses\n       alone.\n   (2) Have one\
    \ local area in the EON, with LOC-AREA value 0.  This\n       would eliminate\
    \ the problem of name-toNSAP-address binding, but\n       would not permit experimentation\
    \ with area routing.  It would\n       not, however preclude the use of areas\
    \ later, for example, when\n       OSI directory services are widely available.\n\
    \   (3) Make the local area a simple function of the Internet address.\n     \
    \  The advantage of this is that it would permit experimentation\n       with\
    \ area addressing without requiring additional directory\n       services, but\
    \ the areas derived would not be under the control of\n       the experimenters\
    \ and may not correspond to anything useful or\n       meaningful for the purposes\
    \ of this experiment.\n   We believe that initially, the preferred alternative\
    \ is to use only\n   zero-valued local areas.  Later editions of this memo may\
    \ contain\n   proposals for use of the local area field, when the IS-IS proposal\
    \ is\n   more mature and perhaps when OSI directory services are in use among\n\
    \   experimenters.\n   The value of the high-order portion of the DSP will be\
    \ set in\n   accordance with RFC 1069.\n"

- title: Multicast Addresses on the IP Subnet
  contents:
  - "Multicast Addresses on the IP Subnet\n   The ES-IS and IS-IS routing exchange\
    \ protocols assume that broadcast\n   subnetworks support two multicast addresses:\
    \ one for all ESs and the\n   other for all ISs.  While one could obviate this\
    \ issue by treating\n   the IP subnet as a general topology subnetwork or as a\
    \ set of point-\n   to-point links, it is also desirable to treat the IP subnet\
    \ as a\n   broadcast subnetwork for the purpose of testing those parts of an\n\
    \   implementation that run over broadcast subnets.  A participating\n   implementor\
    \ not having access to several local machines running the\n   OSI CLNL may test\
    \ the protocols over the IP subnet as if the IP\n   subnet were a broadcast subnet.\n\
    \   The multicasting assumed by the OSI CLNL can be simulated by a small\n   sublayer\
    \ lying between the OSI CLNL and the IP subnet layer.  For the\n   purpose of\
    \ this discussion, call this sublayer an SNAcP, a SubNetwork\n   Access Protocol,\
    \ in OSI argot.  In each system the SNAcP caches a\n   table of the Internet addresses\
    \ of systems that it considers to be\n   reachable in one ISO 8473-hop over the\
    \ IP subnet.  These are called\n   \"core\" systems.  In this sense, the use of\
    \ the cache simulates a set\n   of links over which a system will send ISO configuration\
    \ messages (ES\n   Hello, IS Hello, etc.) when it comes up.  As a local matter,\
    \ the\n   table of core systems may or may not expand during the system's\n  \
    \ lifetime, in response to configuration messages from other core\n   systems.\n\
    \   On the outgoing path, the SNAcP accepts an ISO-gram and a parameter\n   indicating\
    \ the intended use of this ISO-gram: send to a single\n   system, to all ESs,\
    \ to all ISs, or to all systems.  If the indended\n   destination is a single\
    \ system, the ISO-gram is sent only to its\n   destination.  Otherwise, the SNAcP\
    \ makes a copy of the ISO-gram for\n   each of the SNPA-addresses in the cache,\
    \ effecting a broadcast to all\n   participating systems.  Before passing an ISO-gram\
    \ to the IP subnet\n   layer, the SNAcP prepends an SNAcP header to each outgoing\
    \ ISO-gram.\n   This header will take the form:\n                          SNAcP\
    \ Header Format\n       Octet   Value                       Meaning\n       --------------------------------------------------------\n\

    \     Not a multicast address\n               01            All ESs\n        \
    \       02            All ISs\n               03            Broadcast\n      \

    \            OSI checksum as defined in ISO 8473\n   The SNAcP header has three\
    \ fields, a version number field, a\n   semantics field, and a checksum field.\
    \  The version number will take\n   the value 01.  The checksum field will take\
    \ the two octet ISO\n   (Fletcher) checksum of the SNAcP header.  The checksum\
    \ algorithm is\n   described in ISO 8473.\n   The semantics field will take one\
    \ of 4 values, indicating \"all ESs\",\n   \"all ISs\", \"broadcast\", or \"not\
    \ a multicast address\".  The value of\n   the semantics field is determined by\
    \ a parameter passed to the SNAcP\n   by the calling OSI network entity.  A participant\
    \ in the experiment\n   may test the OSI network layer over a set of point-to-point\
    \ links by\n   choosing not to use the multicast capabilities provided by the\
    \ SNAcP\n   on the outgoing path.\n   On the incoming path, the SNAcP inspects\
    \ the SNAcP header and decides\n   whether or not to accept the ISO-gram.  If\
    \ it accepts the ISO-gram,\n   the SNAcP removes the SNAcP header and passes the\
    \ ISO-gram to the OSI\n   CLNL, otherwise, it discards the ISO-gram.  The SNAcP\
    \ will always\n   accept ISO-grams with SNAcP headers indicating \"not a multicast\n\
    \   address\" (value zero in the semantics field) and \"broadcast\" (value\n \
    \  03).  Whether an SNAcP will accept ISO-grams for either of the two\n   multicast\
    \ groups \"all ESs\" (value 1) and \"all ISs\" (value 2) will\n   depend on local\
    \ configuration information.  If the system on which\n   the SNAcP resides is\
    \ configured as an end system, it will accept\n   ISO-grams destined for \"all\
    \ ESs\" and if it is configured as an\n   intermediate system, it will accept\
    \ ISO-grams destined for \"all ISs\".\n   A participant who is testing the OSI\
    \ network layer over a set of\n   point-to-point links will accept ISO-grams according\
    \ to these rules\n   as well.\n   Consideration was given to making the SNAcP\
    \ extensible by making the\n   semantics and checksum fields variable-length parameters,\
    \ in the\n   manner of ISO 8473.  We feel that the presence of a version number\n\
    \   provides sufficient extensibility.\n"

    \ follows.\n   When the SNAcP attempts to broadcast or multicast an ISO-gram,\n\
    \   addresses in the cache that are marked as unusable are ignored.  When\n  \
    \ the SNAcP attempts to send a non-multicast ISO-gram to an unusable\n   cached\
    \ address, the SNAcP returns an error indication to the OSI\n   CLNL.  In this\
    \ way, when the OSI CLNL uses the SNAcP to simulate a\n   set of point-to-point\
    \ links, it is notified when a link fails, but\n   when the OSI CLNL uses the\
    \ SNAcP to simulate a multicast subnet, it\n   is not notified when one system\
    \ on the subnet goes down.\n"

  - "Use of UDP/IP in Lieu of IP\n   In addition to using IP directly, for testing\
    \ purposes it may be\n   useful to support the OSI CLNL over the User Datagram\
    \ Protocol (UDP).\n   This is because some implementors do not have direct access\
    \ to IP,\n   but do have access to the UDP.  For example, an implementor may have\n\
    \   an a binary license for an operating system that provides TCP/IP and\n   UDP/IP,\
    \ but no direct access to IP.  These implementors may\n   participate in a parallel\
    \ experiment, called EON-UDP, by using UDP/IP\n   as a subnetwork instead of using\
    \ the IP subnet.  In this case, the\n   OSI NPDU (after fragmentation, if applicable)\
    \ will be placed in the\n   data portion of a UDP datagram.  UDP port 147 (decimal)\
    \ has been\n   assigned for this purpose.  These participants will place an SNAcP\n\
    \   between UDP and ISO 8473 rather than between IP and ISO 8473.  In all\n  \
    \ other respects, the EON-UDP experiment is identical to the EON\n   experiment.\n\
    \   Of course, network layers entities using the UDP/IP subnet will not\n   interoperate\
    \ directly with network layers entities using the IP\n   subnet.  The procedures\
    \ proposed in this memo do not prevent an\n   implementor from building an EON\
    \ to EON-UDP gateway, however the\n   issues related to building and routing to\
    \ such a gateway are not\n   addressed in this memo.  This memo simply proposes\
    \ two distinct\n   parallel experiments for two groups of experimenters having\
    \ different\n   resources.\n   The preferred method of experimentation is to use\
    \ the IP subnet, in\n   other words, EON.  The EON-UDP variant is intended for\
    \ use only by\n   those who cannot participate in EON.\n"

    \ Topology\n   The U of Fordor system 192.5.2.1 may, in addition to acting as\
    \ an IS,\n   begin acting as an ES at any time, by participating in the ES-IS\n\
    \   protocol as an ES and by beginning to serve a set of NSAPs.  It may\n   act\
    \ as an ES or as an IS or as both.  In fact, the U of Fordor\n   systems 192.5.2.1\
    \ and 192.5.2.2 could reverse roles at any time,\n   regardless of their physical\
    \ connectivity to the Internet, merely by\n   modifying their use of the ES-IS\
    \ protocol and by their serving or not\n   serving NSAPs.  Suppose that these\
    \ two systems reverse roles:\n   192.5.2.1 becomes an ES, not a core system, and\
    \ 192.5.2.2 becomes a\n   core system and an IS.  Suppose further that the experimenters\
    \ at the\n   U of Fordor do not inform the IANA of the change immediately, so\
    \ the\n   core.EON file is out-of-date for a while.  The effect will be that\n\
    \   other core systems will continue to send configuration messages to\n   192.5.2.1,\
    \ which will respond as an ES, not as an IS, and it will\n   appear that 192.5.2.2\
    \ is not reachable from the rest of the topology\n   because the other core systems\
    \ will not know to send configuration\n   information to it.  However, when 192.5.2.2\
    \ is booted, it will send\n   configuration messages to all core systems informing\
    \ them of its\n   existence via the IS-IS protocol.  Those core systems that are\
    \ acting\n   as ISs will respond with their configuration messages, update their\n\
    \   core system caches, thereby establishing a set of logical links\n   between\
    \ 192.5.2.2 and the rest of the core systems.\n"
