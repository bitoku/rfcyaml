Abstract This RFC describes a PICS Proforma translated into an Internet acceptable form.
The Original document was developed according to ISO 9646 for conformance test purposes.
This document is intended for both developers and users of the NTP (Network Time Protocol).
This document contains specific information and performance characteristics for the use of NTP within the context of Internet usage.
It is suggested, that users wishing to use the synchronization capabilities of the Internet abide by the characteristics set within this document.
For more information please contact Dr. David Mills at Mills@udel.edu or review RFC 1305 for more information.
To evaluate conformance of a particular implementation, it is necessary to have a statement of the capabilities and options that have been implemented for a given protocol.
Such a statement is called a Protocol Implementation Conformance Statement (PICS).
This document provides the PICS proforma for the Network Time Protocol (NTP) in compliance with the relevant requirements, and in accordance with the relevant guidance, given in ISO/IEC 9646 2.

INSTRUCTIONS FOR COMPLETION OF PICS
The supplier of a protocol implementation which is claimed to conform to NTP version 3 is required to complete a copy of the PICS proforma provided in this document and is required to provide the information necessary to identify both the supplier and the implementation.
