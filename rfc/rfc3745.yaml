  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   This document describes the registration of the MIME [MIME1]\
    \ sub-\n   types image/jp2, video/mj2, image/jpx, and image/jpm.  The image\n\
    \   encoding is defined by [ISO-JPEG2000-1].\n   The still image file format to\
    \ which this document refers is defined\n   in Annex I of [ISO-JPEG2000-1].  Note\
    \ that a file format is optional\n   in [ISO-JPEG2000-1], but mandatory for the\
    \ MIME sub-type.  This\n   document is not related to the definition of the MIME\
    \ sub-type\n   image/jpeg, which is partly defined by [ISO-JPEG-1], and partly\
    \ by\n   the file format specification defined in [JFIF].\n   JPEG 2000 is a new\
    \ standard, intended to create a image coding system\n   for many types of still\
    \ images (bi-level, gray-level, color, multi-\n   component) with different characteristics\
    \ (natural images,\n   scientific, medical, remote sensing, imagery, text, rendered\n\
    \   graphics, etc.) allowing different imaging models (client/server,\n   real-time\
    \ transmission, image library archival, limited buffer and\n   bandwidth resources,\
    \ etc.) within a unified system.  This coding\n   system is intended to provide\
    \ low bit-rate operation with rate-\n   distortion and subjective image quality\
    \ performance superior to\n   existing standards, without sacrificing performance\
    \ at other points\n   in the rate-distortion spectrum.\n   This standard is intended\
    \ to serve still image compression needs that\n   are currently not served by\
    \ the current JPEG standards [ISO-JPEG-1],\n   [ISO-JPEG-2], [ISO-JPEG-3], and\
    \ [ISO-JPEG-4], and is intended to\n   compliment, not replace, the current JPEG\
    \ standards.  JPEG 2000 is a\n   modern wavelet-based codec that is expected to\
    \ be widely used for\n   still images.  Its use for motion sequences is expected\
    \ to be similar\n   to JPEG:  in those environments where only a single codec\
    \ is\n   required, and JPEG 2000 is available (e.g., digital still cameras\n \
    \  recording short motion sequences) or where frame-by-frame coding is\n   desired\
    \ (no inter-frame coding).\n   There is a standard file format for Motion JPEG\
    \ 2000 sequences.  This\n   file format permits the carriage of audio in addition\
    \ to the video.\n   The format is derived from the ISO Base Media File Format\
    \ as defined\n   in [ISO-JPEG2000-12].  The visual coder in a Motion JPEG 2000\
    \ file is\n   JPEG 2000.  The Motion JPEG 2000 standard is specified in [ISO-\n\
    \   JPEG2000-3].  The ISO Base Media File Format is jointly maintained by\n  \
    \ the ISO/IEC JPEG and MPEG committees.  The MP4 format is also derived\n   from\
    \ the ISO Base Media File Format.\n   Therefore, to identify this restricted usage,\
    \ a new mime type is\n   desirable.\n   This file type is intended always to contain\
    \ a video sequence, though\n   simple audio is permitted in addition to the video.\
    \  Therefore it\n   falls correctly under the \"video\" branch of mime types.\n\
    \   Also within WG1 of ISO there is an effort underway to define a\n   standard\
    \ file format for Compound Images.  This file format\n   optionally supports other\
    \ coding systems, in addition to JPEG 2000,\n   as needed.\n"
- title: 2.  JPEG 2000 Definition
  contents:
  - "2.  JPEG 2000 Definition\n   JPEG 2000 is defined in detail in [ISO-JPEG2000-1].\
    \  The\n   documentation can be obtained from any national standards body or\n\
    \   from ISO at http://www.iso.ch.\n   Information as to its latest status, and\
    \ downloads of the initial\n   documents and some supporting documentation are\
    \ available through the\n   JPEG committee's official Web site at http://www.jpeg.org.\n\
    \   While a brief scope and feature description is provided in this\n   section\
    \ as background information, the reader is directed to the\n   original JPEG 2000\
    \ specification [ISO-JPEG2000-1] to obtain complete\n   feature and technical\
    \ details.\n"
- title: 2.1.  JPEG 2000 Scope
  contents:
  - "2.1.  JPEG 2000 Scope\n   JPEG 2000 is used to compress image data that typically\
    \ comes from\n   digital cameras, scanners, frame grabbers, complex image capture\n\
    \   devices such as medical or satellite systems, and paint- and photo-\n   retouching\
    \ programs.  Unlike previous JPEG standards, it includes\n   information necessary\
    \ to allow its use as a complete coding\n   architecture.  [ISO-JPEG2000-1] defines\
    \ a set of lossless (bit-\n   preserving) and lossy compression methods for coding\
    \ continuous-tone,\n   bi-level, gray-scale, or colour digital still images. \
    \ It therefore:\n   -  specifies decoding processes for converting compressed\
    \ image data\n      to reconstructed image data;\n   -  specifies a codestream\
    \ syntax containing information for\n      interpreting the compressed image data;\n\
    \   -  specifies a file format;\n   -  provides guidance on encoding processes\
    \ for converting source\n      image data to compressed image data;\n   -  provides\
    \ guidance on how to implement these processes in practice.\n   [ISO-JPEG2000-1]\
    \ is one of a series of standards which will cover the\n   full range of facilities\
    \ the new architecture is intended to offer.\n   Approval has been given for JPEG\
    \ to develop the following documents\n   in addition to [ISO-JPEG2000-1].\n  \
    \ -  Part 2 - Coding extensions [ISO-JPEG2000-2].  This includes a more\n    \
    \  comprehensive file format and other extensions to the definitions\n      in\
    \ [ISO-JPEG2000-1].  The mime sub-type image/jpx is recommended\n      to describe\
    \ files based on this Part, and a separate RFC is\n      planned to describe this\
    \ usage and its associated file extensions\n      of jpf and jpx.\n   -  Part\
    \ 3 - Motion JPEG 2000 [ISO-JPEG2000-3].  This provides\n      definitions of\
    \ how the standard may be extended for use in\n      recording time series of\
    \ JPEG 2000 images with associated metadata\n      such as audio objects.  This\
    \ document registers the mime sub-type\n      video/mj2 for motion JPEG 2000,\
    \ with associated file extensions\n      mj2 and mjp2.\n   -  Part 4 - Conformance\
    \ [ISO-JPEG2000-4].  This deals with testing of\n      equipment and systems claimed\
    \ to conform to the JPEG 2000\n      standards.\n   -  Part 5 - Reference software\
    \ [ISO-JPEG2000-5].  This will provide\n      developers with a source of publicly\
    \ available reference software.\n      Its role is envisaged as similar in concept\
    \ to that played by the\n      Independent JPEG Group (IJG) in publicizing the\
    \ current [ISO-\n      JPEG-1] standard.\n   -  Part 6 - Compound Image File Format\
    \ [ISO-JPEG2000-6].  This\n      describes a file format used to store compound\
    \ documents using\n      JPEG 2000 compression.  These may contain scanned images,\n\
    \      synthetic images or both.  This work is based on the multi-layer\n    \
    \  Mixed Raster Content (MRC) imaging model, defined in ITU-T T.44 |\n      ISO\
    \ 16485.  The mime sub-type image/jpm is recommended to describe\n      files\
    \ based on this Part.\n   -  Part 7 - Has been withdrawn\n   -  Part 8 - JPSEC\
    \ (Security aspects) [ISO-JPEG2000-8].  This provides\n      standardised tools\
    \ and solutions in terms of specifications in\n      order to ensure the security\
    \ of transaction, protection of\n      contents (IPR), and protection of technologies\
    \ (IP), and to allow\n      applications to generate, consume, and exchange JPEG\
    \ 2000 Secured\n      bitstreams.\n   -  Part 9 - JPIP (Interactive protocols)\
    \ [ISO-JPEG2000-9].  This\n      client-server protocol has been designed to exploit\
    \ JPEG 2000's\n      flexibility with respect to random access, codestream reordering\n\
    \      and incremental decoding in a networked environment.\n   -  Part 10 - JP3D\
    \ (Volumetric imaging) [ISO-JPEG2000-10].  This will\n      provide extensions\
    \ of JPEG 2000 for logically rectangular 3-\n      dimensional data sets with\
    \ no time component.\n   -  Part 11 - JPWL (Wireless applications) [ISO-JPEG2000-11].\
    \  This\n      extends the elements in [ISO-JPEG2000-1] with mechanisms for error\n\
    \      protection and correction.\n   -  Part 12 - ISO Base Media File Format\
    \ [ISO-JPEG2000-12].  This is\n      the part of the file format used by JPEG\
    \ 2000 which is common with\n      that used within MPEG-4 [ISO-MPEG4].\n"
- title: 2.2.  JPEG 2000 Features
  contents:
  - "2.2.  JPEG 2000 Features\n   Some of the features of JPEG 2000 include:\n   -\
    \  JPEG 2000 is capable of describing bi-level, grayscale, palette-\n      color,\
    \ and full-color image data in several color spaces.\n   -  JPEG 2000 includes\
    \ a number of compression schemes that allow\n      developers to choose the best\
    \ space or time tradeoff for their\n      applications.\n   -  JPEG 2000 is designed\
    \ to be extensible and to evolve gracefully as\n      new needs arise.\n   - \
    \ JPEG 2000 allows the inclusion of an unlimited amount of private\n      or special-purpose\
    \ information within the metadata of its file\n      format.\n   -  These are\
    \ features that JPEG 2000 shares with the definition of\n      TIFF [RFC-TIFF].\
    \  In addition, JPEG 2000 offers:\n   -  state of the art lossless and lossy compression,\
    \ based on wavelet\n      technology, within a single codestream\n   -  low bit-rate\
    \ compression performance effective down to below 0.25\n      bits per pixel for\
    \ high resolution gray-scale images\n   -  large image handling (greater than\
    \ 64k x 64k pixels) without\n      tiling\n   -  single decompression architecture.\
    \  The current JPEG standard\n      [ISO-JPEG-1] has 44 modes, many of which are\
    \ application specific\n      and not used by the majority of JPEG decoders.\n\
    \   -  features to improve transmission in noisy environments, for\n      example\
    \ mobile radio / telephony\n   -  capability to handle both natural and computer\
    \ generated imagery\n"
- title: 3.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "3.  Security Considerations\n   JPEG 2000 utilizes a structure that can store\
    \ image data, and\n   metadata corresponding to this image data.  The fields defined\
    \ in the\n   JPEG 2000 standards are of a descriptive nature and provide\n   information\
    \ that may be useful to facilitate viewing, rendering and\n   cataloging of images\
    \ by a recipient.  As such, the fields currently\n   defined in the JPEG 2000\
    \ standards do not in themselves create\n   additional security risks, since the\
    \ fields are not used to induce\n   any particular behavior by the recipient application.\
    \  It should be\n   noted that selected metadata fields may encompass information\
    \ partly\n   intended to protect the image against unauthorized use or\n   distribution.\
    \  In this case the intention is that alteration or\n   removal of the data in\
    \ the field would be treated as an offense under\n   national agreements based\
    \ World Intellectual Property Organization\n   (WIPO) treaties.\n   JPEG 2000\
    \ has an extensible structure, so that it is theoretically\n   possible that metadata\
    \ fields could be defined in the future which\n   could be used to induce particular\
    \ actions on the part of the\n   recipient, thus presenting additional security\
    \ risks, but this type\n   of capability is currently not supported in the referenced\
    \ JPEG 2000\n   specification.\n   Encryption, signing, or authentication of these\
    \ file formats can use\n   mechanisms defined in [ISO-JPEG2000-8].\n"
