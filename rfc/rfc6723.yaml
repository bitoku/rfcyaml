  - "1.  Introduction\n   The control-word negotiation mechanism specified in [RFC4447],\n\
    \   Section 6.2, encounters a problem when a PE changes the preference\n   for\
    \ the use of the control word from NOT PREFERRED to PREFERRED.\n   [RFC4447] specifies\
    \ that if both endpoints prefer the use of the\n   control word, then the pseudowire\
    \ control word should be used.\n   However, in the case where a PE changes its\
    \ preference from NOT\n   PREFERRED to PREFERRED and both ends of the PW (pseudowire)\
    \ PE have\n   the use of control word set as PREFERRED, an incorrect negotiated\n\
    \   result of the control word as \"not used\" occurs.  This document\n   updates\
    \ the control-word negotiation mechanism in [RFC4447] by adding\n   a Label Request\
    \ message to resolve this negotiation issue for single-\n   segment PW.  Multi-segment\
    \ PW in [RFC6073] inherits the control-word\n   negotiation mechanism in [RFC4447],\
    \ and this document updates\n   [RFC6073] by adding the processing of Label Request\
    \ message on the\n   S-PE (Switching Provider Edge).  When the PE changes the\
    \ preference\n   for the use of control word from PREFERRED to NOT PREFERRED,\
    \ it\n   should follow [RFC4447], and there is no problem.\n"

- title: 3.  Problem Statement
  contents:
  - "3.  Problem Statement\n   [RFC4447], Section 6, describes the control-word negotiation\n\
    \   mechanism.  Each PW endpoint has a configurable parameter that\n   specifies\
    \ whether the use of the control word is PREFERRED or NOT\n   PREFERRED.  During\
    \ control-word negotiation, if one PE advertises a C\n   bit set to 0 in the Label\
    \ Mapping message with its locally configured\n   use of control word as PREFERRED,\
    \ and a corresponding peer PE changes\n   its use of control word from NOT PREFERRED\
    \ to PREFERRED, this causes\n   an incorrect negotiated control-word result of\
    \ \"not used\".\n   The following case will describe the negotiation problem in\
    \ detail:\n                +-------+                    +-------+\n          \
    \      |       |         PW         |       |\n                |  PE1  |====================|\
    \  PE2  |\n                |       |                    |       |\n          \
    \      +-------+                    +-------+\n                              \
    \   Figure 1\n   1.  Initially, the use of control word on PE1 is configured as\n\
    \       PREFERRED, and on PE2 as NOT PREFERRED.\n   2.  The negotiation result\
    \ for the control word of this PW is not\n       used, and ultimately PE1 sends\
    \ the Label Mapping message with C\n       bit set to 0 according to [RFC4447],\
    \ Section 6.2.\n   3.  PE2 then changes its use of control-word configuration\
    \ from NOT\n       PREFERRED to PREFERRED, by deleting PW configuration with NOT\n\
    \       PREFERRED use of control word, and configuring the PW again with\n   \
    \    PREFERRED use of control word.\n   4.  PE2 will then send the Label Withdraw\
    \ message to PE1, and\n       correspondingly will receive the Label Release message\
    \ from PE1.\n   5.  According to the control-word negotiation mechanism, the\n\
    \       previously received Label Mapping message on PE2 from PE1 carries\n  \
    \     the C bit set to 0; therefore, PE2 will still send the Label\n       Mapping\
    \ message with the C bit set to 0.\n   The negotiation result for the control\
    \ word is still not used, even\n   though the use of control-word configuration\
    \ on both PE1 and PE2 are\n   PREFERRED.\n"
- title: 4.  Control-Word Renegotiation by Label Request Message
  contents:
  - "4.  Control-Word Renegotiation by Label Request Message\n   The control-word\
    \ negotiation mechanism in [RFC4447], Section 6, is\n   updated to add the Label\
    \ Request message described in this section.\n   The renegotiation process begins\
    \ when the local PE has received the\n   remote Label Mapping message with the\
    \ C bit set to 0, and at the\n   point its use of control word is changed from\
    \ NOT PREFERRED to\n   PREFERRED.  The following additional procedure will be\
    \ carried out:\n   i.    The local PE MUST send a Label Release message to remote\
    \ PE.\n         If local PE has previously sent a Label Mapping message, it\n\
    \         MUST send a Label Withdraw message to remote PE and wait until\n   \
    \      it has received a Label Release message from the remote PE.\n         Note:\
    \ the above-mentioned sending of the Label Release message\n         and Label\
    \ Withdraw message does not require a specific\n         sequence.\n   ii.   The\
    \ local PE MUST send a Label Request message to the peer PE,\n         and then\
    \ MUST wait until it receives a Label Mapping message\n         containing the\
    \ peer's current configured preference for use of\n         control word.\n  \
    \ iii.  After receiving the remote peer PE Label Mapping message with\n      \
    \   the C bit, the local PE MUST follow the procedures defined in\n         [RFC4447],\
    \ Section 6, when sending its Label Mapping message.\n   The remote PE will follow\
    \ [RFC4447], and once the remote PE has\n   successfully processed the Label Withdraw\
    \ message and Label Release\n   message, it will reset its use of control word\
    \ with the locally\n   configured preference.  Then, the remote PE will send a\
    \ Label Mapping\n   message with locally configured preference for use of control\
    \ word as\n   a response to Label Request message as specified in [RFC5036].\n\
    \   Note: for the local PE, before processing new request to change the\n   configuration,\
    \ the above message-exchanging process should be\n   finished.  The FEC (Forwarding\
    \ Equivalence Class) element in the\n   Label Request message should be the PE's\
    \ local PW FEC element.  As a\n   response to the Label Request message, the peer\
    \ PE should send a\n   Label Mapping message with its own local PW FEC element.\
    \  The Label\n   Request message format and procedure is described in [RFC5036].\n"
- title: 4.1.  Control-Word Renegotiation for Multi-Segment PW
  contents:
  - "4.1.  Control-Word Renegotiation for Multi-Segment PW\n   The multi-segment PW\
    \ case for a T-PE (Terminating Provider Edge)\n   operates similarly as the PE\
    \ in single-segment PW described in the\n   above section.  An initial passive\
    \ role is defined in [RFC6073] for\n   the S-PE when processing of the Label Mapping\
    \ message.  [RFC6073] is\n   updated by applying this passive role to the processing\
    \ of Label\n   Request message.  When an S-PE receives a Label Request message\
    \ from\n   one of its adjacent PEs (which may be an S-PE or another T-PE), it\n\
    \   MUST send a matching Label Request message to other adjacent PE\n   (again,\
    \ it may be an S-PE or a T-PE).  This is necessary since an\n   S-PE does not\
    \ have complete information of the interface parameter\n   field in the FEC advertisement.\
    \  When the S-PE receives a Label\n   Release message from remote PE, it MUST\
    \ send a corresponding Label\n   Release message to the other remote PE when it\
    \ holds a label for the\n   PW from the remote PE.\n   Note: because the local\
    \ T-PE will send a Label Withdraw message\n   before sending a Label Request message\
    \ to the remote peer, the S-PE\n   MUST process the Label Withdraw message before\
    \ the Label Request\n   message.  When the S-PE receives the Label Withdraw message,\
    \ it\n   should process this message to send a Label Release message as a\n  \
    \ response and a Label Withdraw message to an upstream S-PE/T-PE.  The\n   S-PE\
    \ will then process the next LDP message, e.g. the Label Request\n   message.\n\
    \   When the local PE changes the use of control word from PREFERRED to\n   NOT\
    \ PREFERRED, the local PE would then renegotiate the control word\n   so that\
    \ it is not used by deleting the PW configuration with\n   PREFERRED use of control\
    \ word, and configuring the PW again with NOT\n   PREFERRED use of control word.\
    \  All of these procedures have been\n   defined in [RFC4447], Section 5.4.1.\n\
    \   The diagram in Appendix A of this document updates the control-word\n   negotiation\
    \ diagram in [RFC4447] Appendix A.\n"
- title: 4.2.  Control-Word Renegotiation Use Case
  contents:
  - "4.2.  Control-Word Renegotiation Use Case\n   The procedure of PE1 and PE2 for\
    \ the use case in Figure 1 will become\n   as follows:\n   1.  PE2 changes locally\
    \ configured preference for use of control word\n       to PREFERRED.\n   2. \
    \ PE2 will then send the Release messages to PE1.  PE2 will also\n       send\
    \ the Label Withdraw message, and wait until it has received\n       the Label\
    \ Release message from PE1.\n   3.  PE1 will send the Label Release message in\
    \ response to the Label\n       Withdraw message from PE2.  After processing the\
    \ Label Release\n       from PE2, PE1 will then reset the use of control word\
    \ to the\n       locally configured preference as PREFERRED.\n   4.  Upon receipt\
    \ of the Label Release message from PE1, PE2 will send\n       the Label Request\
    \ message to PE1, and proceed to wait until a\n       Label Mapping message is\
    \ received.\n   5.  PE1 will send a Label Mapping message with the C bit set to\
    \ 1\n       again to PE2 in response to the Label Request message.\n   6.  PE2\
    \ receives the Label Mapping message from PE1 and gets the\n       remote label\
    \ binding information.  PE2 will wait for the PE1\n       Label Mapping message\
    \ before sending its Label Mapping message\n       with the C bit set.\n   7.\
    \  PE2 will send the Label Mapping to PE1 with C bit set to 1, and\n       follow\
    \ procedures defined in [RFC4447], Section 6.\n   While it is assumed that PE1\
    \ is configured to prefer the use of the\n   control word, in step 5, if PE1 doesn't\
    \ prefer or support the control\n   word, PE1 would then send the Label Mapping\
    \ message with the C bit\n   set to 0.  As a result, PE2 in step 7 would send\
    \ a Label Mapping\n   message with the C bit set 0 as per [RFC4447], Section 6.\n\
    \   By sending a Label Request message, PE2 will get the locally\n   configured\
    \ preference for use of control word of peer PE1 in the\n   received Label Mapping\
    \ message.  By using the new C bit from the\n   Label Mapping message received\
    \ from peer PE1 and the locally\n   configured preference for use of control word,\
    \ PE2 should determine\n   the use of PW control word according to [RFC4447],\
    \ Section 6.\n"
- title: 5.  Backward Compatibility
  contents:
  - "5.  Backward Compatibility\n   Since control-word negotiation mechanism is updated\
    \ by adding the\n   Label Request message, and still follows the basic procedure\n\
    \   described in [RFC4447], Section 6, this document is fully compatible\n   with\
    \ existing implementations.  For single-segment pseudowire, the\n   remote PE\
    \ (PE1 in Figure 1) which already implements [RFC4447], and\n   the Label Request\
    \ message as defined in [RFC5036] could be compatible\n   with the PE (PE2 in\
    \ Figure 1) following the mechanism of this\n   document.  For the multi-segment\
    \ pseudowire, the T-PE is the same as\n   PE in single-segment pseudowire; the\
    \ S-PE should be upgraded with the\n   mechanism defined in this document.\n"
