- title: Abstract
  contents:
  - "Abstract\n   To provide Multicast VPN (MVPN) service, Provider Edge routers\n\
    \   originate BGP Update messages that carry Multicast-VPN (\"MCAST-VPN\")\n \
    \  BGP routes; they also originate unicast VPN routes that carry MVPN-\n   specific\
    \ attributes.  These routes encode addresses from the\n   customer's address space,\
    \ as well as addresses from the provider's\n   address space.  These two address\
    \ spaces are independent, and the\n   address family (IPv4 or IPv6) of the two\
    \ spaces may or may not be the\n   same.  These routes always contain an \"address\
    \ family\" field that\n   specifies whether the customer addresses are IPv4 addresses\
    \ or\n   whether they are IPv6 addresses.  However, there is no field that\n \
    \  explicitly specifies the address family of the provider addresses.\n   To ensure\
    \ interoperability, this document specifies that provider\n   IPv4 addresses are\
    \ always encoded in these update messages as 4-octet\n   addresses, and that the\
    \ distinction between IPv4 and IPv6 is signaled\n   solely by the length of the\
    \ address field.  Specific cases are\n   explained in detail.  This document updates\
    \ RFC 6514.\n"

- title: 1.1.  IPv4 and IPv6 Addresses in MCAST-VPN Routes
  contents:
  - "1.1.  IPv4 and IPv6 Addresses in MCAST-VPN Routes\n   [MVPN-BGP] defines a new\
    \ set of BGP route types that are used by\n   service providers (SPs) to provide\
    \ Multicast Virtual Private Network\n   service to their customers.  These routes\
    \ have a newly defined BGP\n   NLRI, the \"MCAST-VPN\" NLRI.  The MCAST-VPN NLRI\
    \ is carried in the\n   NLRI field of the MP_REACH_NLRI/MP_UNREACH_NLRI attributes\
    \ defined in\n   [BGP-MP].  The SAFI field of the MP_REACH_NLRI/MP_UNREACH_NLRI\n\
    \   attribute is used to identify the NLRI as being an MCAST-VPN NLRI.\n   When\
    \ the SAFI field of an MP_REACH_NLRI/MP_UNREACH_NLRI attribute has\n   the \"\
    MCAST-VPN\" value, the AFI field has two defined values: 1 and 2.\n   AFI 1 indicates\
    \ that any customer multicast addresses occurring in\n   the MP_REACH_NLRI/MP_UNREACH_NLRI\
    \ attribute are IPv4 addresses; AFI 2\n   indicates that such addresses are IPv6\
    \ addresses.\n   However, some of the MCAST-VPN routes also contain addresses\
    \ of\n   Provider Edge (PE) routers in the SP network.  An SP with an IPv4\n \
    \  network may provide MVPN service for customers using IPv6, and an SP\n   with\
    \ an IPv6 network may provide MVPN service for customers that use\n   IPv4.  Therefore,\
    \ the address family of the PE addresses MUST NOT be\n   inferred from the AFI\
    \ field of the associated\n   MP_REACH_NLRI/MP_UNREACH_NLRI attribute.\n   The\
    \ purpose of this document is to make clear that whenever a PE\n   address occurs\
    \ in an MCAST-VPN route (whether in the NLRI or in an\n   attribute), the IP address\
    \ family of that address is determined by\n   the length of the address (a length\
    \ of 4 octets for IPv4 addresses, a\n   length of 16 octets for IPv6 addresses),\
    \ NOT by the AFI field of the\n   route.\n   In particular, if a SP with an IPv4\
    \ core network is providing\n   MVPN/IPv6 service to a customer, the PE addresses\
    \ in the MCAST-VPN\n   routes will be 4-octet IPv4 routes, even though the AFI\
    \ of those\n   routes will have the value 2.\n   Some previous specifications\
    \ (e.g., [RFC4659] and [RFC4798]) have\n   taken a different approach, requiring\
    \ that in any routes containing\n   IPv6 or VPN-IPv6 customer addresses, the IPv4\
    \ PE addresses be\n   represented as IPv6-mapped IPv4 addresses [RFC4291].  This\
    \ document\n   does not use that approach.  Rather, this specification uses the\n\
    \   approach adopted in [RFC4684] and [RFC5549].  The MCAST-VPN routes\n   contain\
    \ enough information to enable the IP address family of the PE\n   addresses to\
    \ be inferred from the address lengths.\n   [MVPN-BGP] also defines an attribute,\
    \ the \"VRF Route Import Extended\n   Community\", that is attached to unicast\
    \ VPN-IPv4 or VPN-IPv6 routes.\n   This extended community contains a PE address,\
    \ and this document\n   specifies how to encode an IPv6 address in this attribute,\n\
    \   independent of whether the attribute is attached to a VPN-IPv4 route\n   or\
    \ a VPN-IPv6 route.\n   This document also clarifies an issue with respect to\
    \ the\n   significance of the Address Family field of an Intra-AS I-PMSI A-D\n\
    \   route that carries a PMSI Tunnel Attribute.\n"

- title: 2.  PE Addresses in MCAST-VPN Routes
  contents:
  - "2.  PE Addresses in MCAST-VPN Routes\n     PE addresses occur in MCAST-VPN routes\
    \ in the following places:\n   1. \"Network Address of Next Hop\" field in the\
    \ MP_REACH_NLRI\n      attribute, as defined in Section 3 of [BGP-MP].  This field\
    \ is\n      preceded by a \"length of next hop address\" field.  Hence, it is\n\
    \      always clear whether the address is an IPv4 address (length is 4)\n   \
    \   or an IPv6 address (length is 16).  If the length of the next hop\n      address\
    \ is neither 4 nor 16, the MP_REACH_NLRI attribute MUST be\n      considered to\
    \ be \"incorrect\", and MUST be handled as specified in\n      Section 7 of [BGP-MP].\n\
    \   2. \"Intra-AS I-PMSI A-D route\", defined in Section 4.1 of [MVPN-BGP].\n\
    \      All MCAST-VPN routes begin with a 1-octet route type field,\n      followed\
    \ by a 1-octet \"NLRI length\" field.  In the Intra-AS I-PMSI\n      A-D route,\
    \ the length is followed by an 8-octet Route\n      Distinguisher (RD), which\
    \ is then followed by the \"Originating\n      Router's IP Address\" field.  The\
    \ length of this field (4 octets\n      for IPv4 or 16 octets for IPv6) can thus\
    \ be inferred from the NLRI\n      length field (which will be either 12 or 24,\
    \ respectively).  If\n      the inferred length of the \"Originating Router's\
    \ IP Address\" field\n      is neither 4 nor 16, the MP_REACH_NLRI attribute MUST\
    \ be\n      considered to be \"incorrect\", and MUST be handled as specified in\n\
    \      Section 7 of [BGP-MP].\n   3. \"S-PMSI A-D Route\", defined in Section\
    \ 4.3 of [MVPN-BGP].  In this\n      route, the \"NLRI length\" field is followed\
    \ by an 8-octet RD, a\n      variable-length \"multicast source\" field, a variable-length\n\
    \      \"multicast group\" field, and an \"Originating Router's IP Address\"\n\
    \      field.  The two variable-length fields have their own length\n      fields.\
    \  From these two length fields and the NLRI length field,\n      one can compute\
    \ the length of the \"Originating Router's IP\n      Address\" field, which again\
    \ is either 4 for IPv4 or 16 for IPv6.\n      If the computed length of the \"\
    Originating Router's IP Address\"\n      field is neither 4 nor 16, the MP_REACH_NLRI\
    \ attribute MUST be\n      considered to be \"incorrect\", and MUST be handled\
    \ as specified in\n      Section 7 of [BGP-MP].\n   4. \"Leaf A-D Route\", defined\
    \ in Section 4.4 of [MVPN-BGP].  In this\n      route, the \"NLRI length\" field\
    \ is following by a variable-length\n      \"route key\", which is followed by\
    \ the \"Originating Router's IP\n      Address\" field.  The Route Key has its\
    \ own length field.  From the\n      NLRI length and the route key length, one\
    \ can compute the length\n      of the \"Originating Router's IP Address\" field.\
    \  If the computed\n      length of the \"Originating Router's IP Address\" field\
    \ is neither 4\n      nor 16, the MP_REACH_NLRI attribute MUST be considered to\
    \ be\n      \"incorrect\", and MUST be handled as specified in Section 7 of\n\
    \      [BGP-MP].\n"

    , specified in [MVPN-BGP],\n   is an attribute carried by unicast VPN-IPv4 or\

    \ of type \"VRF Route\n   Import\"; hence, it can only carry an IPv4 address.\

  contents:
  - "4.  PMSI Tunnel Attributes in I-PMSI A-D Routes\n   When a PMSI Tunnel Attribute\
    \ occurs in an I-PMSI A-D route originated\n   by a particular PE or Autonomous\
    \ System Border Router (ASBR), it\n   identifies a tunnel that the PE/ASBR uses\
    \ by default for carrying the\n   multicast traffic of a particular customer MVPN.\
    \  The proper encoding\n   and interpretation of the PMSI Tunnel attribute is\
    \ affected by both\n   the AFI and \"Network Address of Next Hop\" fields.\n"
- title: 4.1.  Relationship to AFI Value
  contents:
  - "4.1.  Relationship to AFI Value\n   When the PMSI Tunnel Attribute occurs in\
    \ a BGP Update message with a\n   MP_REACH_NLRI attribute whose AFI is 1, the\
    \ meaning is that the\n   identified tunnel is used by default to carry IPv4 MVPN\
    \ traffic for a\n   particular customer MVPN. When the PMSI Tunnel Attribute occurs\
    \ in a\n   BGP Update message with a MP_REACH_NLRI attribute whose AFI is 2, the\n\
    \   meaning is that the identified tunnel is used by default to carry\n   IPv6\
    \ MVPN traffic for a particular customer MVPN.  To assign both\n   IPv4 and IPv6\
    \ MVPN traffic to an I-PMSI tunnel, two I-PMSI A-D routes\n   MUST be used --\
    \ one whose MP_REACH_NLRI has an AFI of 1 and one whose\n   MP_REACH_NLRI has\
    \ an AFI of 2.  To use the same tunnel for both IPv4\n   and IPv6 traffic, the\
    \ same value of the PMSI Tunnel attribute can be\n   used in each route.\n"
- title: 4.2.  Relationship to Next Hop Address Family
  contents:
  - "4.2.  Relationship to Next Hop Address Family\n   If the \"Network Address of\
    \ Next Hop\" field in the MP_REACH_NLRI\n   attribute contains an IPv4 address,\
    \ then any IP addresses appearing\n   in the \"Tunnel Identifier\" field of the\
    \ PMSI Tunnel Attribute MUST be\n   IPv4 addresses.\n   If the \"Network Address\
    \ of Next Hop\" field in the MP_REACH_NLRI\n   attribute contains an IPv6 address,\
    \ then any IP addresses appearing\n   in the \"Tunnel Identifier\" field of the\
    \ PMSI Tunnel Attribute MUST be\n   IPv6 addresses.\n   If these conditions are\
    \ not met, the PMSI Tunnel Attribute MUST be\n   handled as a \"malformed\" PMSI\
    \ Tunnel Attribute, as specified in\n   Section 5 of [MVPN-BGP].\n"
