- title: 1.  Introduction

  - "1.  Introduction\n   This document is part of the ILNP document set, which has\
    \ had\n   extensive review within the IRTF Routing RG.  ILNP is one of the\n \
    \  recommendations made by the RG Chairs.  Separately, various refereed\n   research\
    \ papers on ILNP have also been published during this decade.\n   So, the ideas\
    \ contained herein have had much broader review than the\n   IRTF Routing RG.\
    \  The views in this document were considered\n   controversial by the Routing\
    \ RG, but the RG reached a consensus that\n   the document still should be published.\
    \  The Routing RG has had\n   remarkably little consensus on anything, so virtually\
    \ all Routing RG\n   outputs are considered controversial.\n   At present, the\
    \ Internet research and development community is\n   exploring various approaches\
    \ to evolving the Internet Architecture to\n   solve a variety of issues including,\
    \ but not limited to, scalability\n   of inter-domain routing [RFC4984].  A wide\
    \ range of other issues\n   (e.g., site multihoming, node multihoming, site/subnet\
    \ mobility, node\n   mobility) are also active concerns at present.  Several different\n\
    \   classes of evolution are being considered by the Internet research\n   and\
    \ development community.  One class is often called \"Map and\n   Encapsulate\"\
    , where traffic would be mapped and then tunnelled\n   through the inter-domain\
    \ core of the Internet.  Another class being\n   considered is sometimes known\
    \ as \"Identifier/Locator Split\".  This\n   document relates to a proposal that\
    \ is in the latter class of\n   evolutionary approaches.\n   ILNP is, in essence,\
    \ an end-to-end architecture: the functions\n   required for ILNP are implemented\
    \ in, and controlled by, only those\n   end-systems that wish to use ILNP, as\
    \ described in [RFC6740].  Other\n   nodes, such as Site Border Routers (SBRs)\
    \ need only support IP to\n   allow operation of ILNP, e.g., an SBR should support\
    \ IPv6 in order to\n   enable end-systems to operate ILNPv6 within the site network\
    \ for\n   which an SBR provides a service [RFC6741].\n   However, some features\
    \ of ILNP could be optimised, from an\n   engineering perspective, by the use\
    \ of an intermediate system (a\n   router, security gateway or \"middlebox\")\
    \ that modifies (rewrites)\n   Locator values of transit ILNP packets.  It would\
    \ also perform other\n   control functions for an entire site, as an administrative\n\
    \   convenience, such as providing a centralised point of management for\n   a\
    \ site.  For example, an SBR might manipulate the topological\n   presence of\
    \ the packet, providing an elegant solution to the\n   provision of functions\
    \ such as site (network) mobility for an entire\n   end site [ABH09a].\n   This\
    \ document discusses several such optional advanced deployment\n   scenarios for\
    \ ILNP.  These typically use an ILNP-capable Site Border\n   Router (SBR).\n \
    \  Nothing in this document is a requirement for any ILNP implementation\n   or\
    \ any ILNP deployment.\n   Readers are strongly advised to first read the ILNP\
    \ Architecture\n   Description [RFC6740], as this document uses the notation and\n\
    \   terminology described or referenced in that document.\n"
- title: 1.1.  Document Roadmap
  contents:
  - "1.1.  Document Roadmap\n   This document describes engineering and implementation\
    \ considerations\n   that are common to ILNP for both IPv4 and IPv6.\n   The ILNP\
    \ architecture can have more than one engineering\n   instantiation.  For example,\
    \ one can imagine a \"clean-slate\"\n   engineering design based on the ILNP architecture.\
    \  In separate\n   documents, we describe two specific engineering instances of\
    \ ILNP.\n   The term \"ILNPv6\" refers precisely to an instance of ILNP that is\n\
    \   based upon, and backwards compatible with, IPv6.  The term \"ILNPv4\"\n  \
    \ refers precisely to an instance of ILNP that is based upon, and\n   backwards\
    \ compatible with, IPv4.\n   Many engineering aspects common to both ILNPv4 and\
    \ ILNPv6 are\n   described in [RFC6741].  A full engineering specification for\
    \ either\n   ILNPv6 or ILNPv4 is beyond the scope of this document.\n   Readers\
    \ are referred to other related ILNP documents for details not\n   described here:\n\
    \   a) [RFC6740] is the main architectural description of ILNP, including\n  \
    \    the concept of operations.\n   b) [RFC6741] describes engineering and implementation\
    \ considerations\n      that are common to both ILNPv4 and ILNPv6.\n   c) [RFC6742]\
    \ defines additional DNS resource records that support\n      ILNP.\n   d) [RFC6743]\
    \ defines a new ICMPv6 Locator Update message used by an\n      ILNP node to inform\
    \ its correspondent nodes of any changes to its\n      set of valid Locators.\n\
    \   e) [RFC6744] defines a new IPv6 Nonce Destination Option used by\n      ILNPv6\
    \ nodes (1) to indicate to ILNP correspondent nodes (by\n      inclusion within\
    \ the initial packets of an ILNP session) that the\n      node is operating in\
    \ the ILNP mode and (2) to prevent off-path\n      attacks against ILNP ICMP messages.\
    \  This Nonce is used, for\n      example, with all ILNP ICMPv6 Locator Update\
    \ messages that are\n      exchanged among ILNP correspondent nodes.\n   f) [RFC6745]\
    \ defines a new ICMPv4 Locator Update message used by an\n      ILNP node to inform\
    \ its correspondent nodes of any changes to its\n      set of valid Locators.\n\
    \   g) [RFC6746] defines a new IPv4 Nonce Option used by ILNPv4 nodes to\n   \
    \   carry a security nonce to prevent off-path attacks against ILNP\n      ICMP\
    \ messages and also defines a new IPv4 Identifier Option used\n      by ILNPv4\
    \ nodes.\n   h) [RFC6747] describes extensions to Address Resolution Protocol\n\
    \      (ARP) for use with ILNPv4.\n"

- title: 2.  Localised Numbering
  contents:
  - "2.  Localised Numbering\n   Today, Network Address Translation (NAT) [RFC3022]\
    \ is used for a\n   number of purposes.  Whilst one of the original intentions\
    \ of NAT was\n   to reduce the rate of use of global IPv4 addresses, through use\
    \ of\n   IPv4 private address space [RFC1918], NAT also offers to site\n   administrators\
    \ a convenient localised address management capability\n   combined with a local-scope/private\
    \ address space, for example,\n   [RFC1918] for IPv4.\n   For IPv6, NAT would\
    \ not necessarily be required to reduce the rate of\n   IPv6 address depletion,\
    \ because the availability of addresses is not\n   such an issue as for IPv4.\
    \  The IETF has standardised Unique Local\n   IPv6 Unicast Addresses [RFC4193],\
    \ which provide local-scope IPv6\n   unicast address space that can be used by\
    \ end sites.  However,\n   localised address management, in a manner similar to\
    \ that provided by\n   IPv4 NAT and private address space [RFC1918], is still\
    \ desirable for\n   IPv6 [RFC5902], even though there is debate about the efficacy\
    \ of\n   such an approach [RFC4864].\n   One of the major concerns that many have\
    \ had with NAT is the loss of\n   end-to-end transport-layer and network-layer\
    \ session state\n   invariance, which is still considered an important architectural\n\
    \   principle by the IAB [RFC4924].  Nevertheless, the use of localised\n   addressing\
    \ remains in wide use and there is interest in its continued\n   use in IPv6,\
    \ e.g., proposals such as [RFC6296].\n   It is possible to have the benefits of\
    \ NAT-like functions for ILNP\n   without losing end-to-end state.  Indeed, such\
    \ a mechanism -- the use\n   of Locator rewriting in ILNP -- forms the basis of\
    \ many of the\n   optional functions described in this document.  In ILNP, we\
    \ call this\n   feature \"localised numbering\".\n   Recall, that a Locator value\
    \ in ILNP has the same semantics as a\n   routing prefix in IP: indeed, in ILNPv4\
    \ and ILNPv6 [RFC6741], routing\n   prefixes from IPv4 and IPv6, respectively,\
    \ are used as Locator\n   values.\n   We note that a deployment using private/local\
    \ numbering can also\n   provide a convenient solution to centralised management\
    \ of site\n   multihoming and network mobility by deploying SBRs in this manner\
    \ --\n   this is described below.\n   Please note that with this proposal, localised\
    \ numbering (e.g., using\n   the equivalent of IP NAT on the ILNP Locator bits)\
    \ would work in\n   harmony with multihoming, mobility (for individual hosts and\
    \ whole\n   networks), and IP Security (IPsec), plus the other advanced functions\n\
    \   described in this document [BA11] [LABH06] [ABH07a] [ABH07b] [ABH08a]\n  \

    \           SBR = Site Border Router\n   Figure 2.1: A Simple Localised Numbering\
    \ Example for ILNP\n   In this scenario, the SBR is allocated global locator value\
    \ L_1 from\n   the upstream provider.  However, the SBR advertises internally\
    \ a\n   \"local\" Locator value L_L.  By \"local\" we mean that the Locator value\n\
    \   only has significance within the site network, and any packets that\n   have\
    \ L_L as a source Locator cannot be forwarded beyond the SBR with\n   value L_L\
    \ as the source Locator.  In engineering terms, L_L would,\n   for example, in\
    \ ILNPv6, be an IPv6 prefix based on the assignments\n   possible according to\
    \ IPv6 Unique Local Addresses (ULAs) [RFC4193].\n   If we assume that H uses Identifier\
    \ I_H, then it will use Identifier-\n   Locator Vector (I-LV) [I_H, L_L], and\
    \ that the correspondent node\n   (CN) uses IL-V [I_CN, L_CN].  If we consider\
    \ that H will send a UDP\n   packet from its port P_H to CN's port P_CN, then\
    \ H could send a\n   UDP/ILNP packet with the tuple expression:\n     <UDP: I_H,\
    \ I_CN, P_H, P_CN><ILNP: L_L, L_CN>           --- (1a)\n   When this packet reaches\
    \ the SBR, it knows that L_L is a local\n   Locator value and so rewrites the\
    \ source Locator on the egress packet\n   to L_1 and forwards that out onto its\
    \ external-facing interface.  The\n   value L_1 is a global prefix, which allows\
    \ the packet to be routed\n   globally:\n     <UDP: I_H, I_CN, P_H, P_CN><ILNP:\
    \ L_1, L_CN>           --- (1b)\n   This packet reaches CN using normal routing\
    \ based on the Locator\n   value L_1, as it is a routing prefix.\n   Note that\
    \ from expressions (1a) and (1b), the end-to-end state (in\n   the UDP tuple)\
    \ remains unchanged -- end-to-end state invariance is\n   honoured, for UDP. \
    \ CN would send a UDP packet to H as:\n     <UDP: I_CN, I_H, P_CN, P_H><ILNP:\
    \ L_CN, L_1>           --- (2a)\n   and the SBR would rewrite the Locator value\
    \ on the ingress packet\n   before forwarding the packet on its internal interface:\n\
    \     <UDP: I_CN, I_H, P_CN, P_H><ILNP: L_CN, L_L>           --- (2b)\n   Again,\
    \ this preserves the end-to-end transport-layer session state\n   invariance.\n\
    \   As the Locator values are not used in the transport-layer pseudo-\n   header\
    \ for ILNP [RFC6741], the checksum would not have to be\n   rewritten.  That is,\
    \ the Locator rewriting function is stateless and\n   has low overhead.\n   (A\
    \ discussion on the generation of Identifier values for initial use\n   is presented\
    \ in [RFC6741].)\n"

    \ both L_1 and L_L within the\n   site, and for hosts within the site to have\
    \ IL-Vs using both L_1 and\n   L_L.  For example, host H may have IL-Vs [I_H,\
    \ L_1] and [I_H, L_L].\n   The configuration and use of such a mechanism can be\
    \ controlled\n   through local policy.\n"
- title: 2.3.  Dealing with Internal Subnets with Locator Rewriting
  contents:
  - "2.3.  Dealing with Internal Subnets with Locator Rewriting\n   Where the site\
    \ network uses subnets, packets will need to be routed\n   correctly, internally.\
    \  That is, the site network may have several\n   internal Locator values, e.g.,\
    \ L_La, L_Lb, and L_Lc.  When an ingress\n   packet has I-LV [I_H, L_1], it is\
    \ expected that the SBR is capable of\n   identifying the correct internal network\
    \ for I_H, and so the correct\n   Locator value to rewrite for the ingress packet.\
    \  This is not obvious\n   as the I value and the L value are not related in any\
    \ way.\n   There are numerous ways the SBR could facilitate the correct lookup\n\
    \   of the internal Locator value.  This document does not prescribe any\n   specific\
    \ method.  Of course, we do not preclude mappings directly\n   from Identifier\
    \ values to internal Locator values.\n   Of course, such a \"flat\" mapping (between\
    \ Identifier values and\n   Locators) would serve, but maintaining such a mapping\
    \ would be\n   impractical for a large site.  So, we propose the following solution.\n\
    \   Consider that the Locator value, L_x consists of two parts, L_pp and\n   L_ss,\
    \ where L_pp is a network prefix and L_ss is a subnet selector.\n   Also, consider\
    \ that this structure is true for both the local\n   identifier, L_L, as well\
    \ as the global Identifier, L_1.  Then, an SBR\n   need only know the mapping\
    \ from the values of L_ss as visible in L_1\n   and the values of L_ss used locally.\n\
    \   Such a mapping could be mechanical, e.g., the L_ss part of L_L and\n   L_1\
    \ are the same and it is only the L_pp part that is different.\n   Where this\
    \ is not desirable (e.g., for obfuscation of interior\n   topology), an administrator\
    \ would need to configure a suitable\n   mapping policy in the SBR, which could\
    \ be realised as a simple lookup\n   table.  Note that with such a policy, the\
    \ L_pp for L_L and L_1 do not\n   need to be of the same size.\n   From a practical\
    \ perspective, this is possible for both ILNPv6\n   [RFC6177] and ILNPv4 [RFC4632].\
    \  For ILNPv6, recall that the Locator\n   value is encoded to be syntactically\
    \ similar to an IPv6 address\n   prefix, as shown in Figure 2.2, taken from [RFC6741].\n\

- title: 2.4.  Localised Name Resolution with DNS
  contents:
  - "2.4.  Localised Name Resolution with DNS\n   To support private numbering with\
    \ IPv4 and IPv6 today, some sites use\n   a split-horizon DNS service for the\
    \ site [appDNS].\n   If a site using localised numbering chooses to deploy a split-horizon\n\
    \   DNS server, then the DNS server would return the global-scope\n   Locator(s)\
    \ (L_1 in our example above) of the SBR to DNS clients\n   outside the site, and\
    \ would advertise the local-scope Locator(s) (L_L\n   in our example above) specific\
    \ to that internal node to DNS clients\n   inside the site.  Such deployments\
    \ of split-horizon DNS servers are\n   not unusual in the IPv4 Internet today.\
    \  If an internal node (e.g.,\n   portable computer) moves outside the site, it\
    \ would follow the normal\n   ILNP methods to update its authoritative DNS server\
    \ with its current\n   Locator set.  In this deployment model, the authoritative\
    \ DNS server\n   for that mobile device will be either the split-horizon DNS server\n\
    \   itself or the master DNS server providing data to the split-horizon\n   DNS\
    \ server.\n   If a site using localised numbering chooses not to deploy a split-\n\
    \   horizon DNS server, then each internal node would advertise the\n   global-scope\
    \ Locator(s) of the site border routers in its respective\n   DNS entries.  To\
    \ deliver packets from one internal node to another\n   internal node, the site\
    \ would choose to use either Layer 2 bridging\n   (e.g., IEEE Spanning Tree or\
    \ IEEE Rapid Spanning Tree [IEEE04], or a\n   link-state Layer 2 algorithm such\
    \ as the IETF TRILL group or IEEE\n   802.1 are developing), or the interior routers\
    \ would forward packets\n   up to the nearest site border router, which in turn\
    \ would then\n   rewrite the Locators to appropriate local-scope values, and forward\n\
    \   the packet towards the interior destination node.\n   Alternately, for sites\
    \ using localised numbering but not deploying a\n   split-horizon DNS server,\
    \ the DNS server could return all global-\n   scope and local-scope Locators to\
    \ all queriers, and assume that nodes\n   would use normal, local address/route\
    \ selection criteria to choose\n   the best Locator to use to reach a given remote\
    \ node ([RFC3484] for\n   older IPv6 nodes, [RFC6724] for newer IPv6 nodes). \
    \ Hosts within the\n   same site as the correspondent node would only have a ULA\
    \ configured;\n   hence, they would select the ULA destination Locator for the\n\
    \   correspondent (L_L in our example).  Hosts outside the site would not\n  \
    \ have the same ULA configured (L_CN for the CN in our example).\n   However,\
    \ ILNP allows use of Locator Preference values [RFC6742]\n   [RFC6743].  These\
    \ values would indicate explicitly the relative\n   preference value given to\
    \ Locator values and so result in the\n   selection of the appropriate Locator\
    \ (and therefore interface) to use\n   for the transmission of an outgoing packet\
    \ with respect to the value\n   to be inserted into the IPv6 Source Address field\
    \ (see Section 3 of\n   [RFC6741]).  A similar argument, with respect to use of\
    \ Locator\n   preference values, applies to the value to be inserted into the\
    \ IPv6\n   Destination Address field.  Certainly, by using appropriate\n   Preference\
    \ values for a host with multiple Locator values, it would\n   be possible to\
    \ emulate some level of resemblance to the address\n   selection rules in [RFC3484]\
    \ and [RFC6724], and this could be\n   controlled via DNS entries for ILNP nodes,\
    \ for example.\n   Indeed, with appropriate use of localised or site-wide policy,\
    \ and\n   appropriate mechanisms in the devices (e.g. in end hosts operating\n\
    \   systems or in Site Border Routers), Preference values for Locator\n   values\
    \ within the DNS could be used for allowing options for multi-\n   homed transport\
    \ sessions and/or site-controlled traffic engineering\n   [ABH09a].  However,\
    \ the details for this are left for further study,\n   and overall, the rules\
    \ defined in [RFC3484] and [RFC6724] cannot be\n   applied directly to ILNPv6\
    \ nodes.\n   Note that for split-horizon operation, there needs to be a DNS\n\
    \   management policy for mobile hosts, as when such hosts are away from\n   their\
    \ \"home\" network, they will need to update DNS entries so that\n   the global-scope\
    \ Locator(s) only is (are) used, and these are\n   consistent with the current\
    \ topological position of the mobile host.\n   Such updates would need to be done\
    \ using Secure Dynamic DNS Update.\n   For an ILNP mobile network using LP records,\
    \ there are likely to\n   separate LP records for internal and external use.\n"

  contents:
  - "2.6.  Site Network Name in DNS\n   In this scenario, if H expects incoming ILNP\

    \ IP, and\n   as already described in [RFC6740], a Fully Qualified Domain Name\n\
    \   (FQDN) lookup for H should resolve to the correct NID and L32/L64\n   records.\
    \  If there are many hosts like H that need to keep DNS\n   records (for any reason,\
    \ including to allow incoming ILNP session\n   requests), then, potentially, there\
    \ are many such DNS resource\n   records.\n   As an optimisation, the network\
    \ as a whole may be configured with one\n   or more L32 and L64 records (to store\

    \ same time, individual hosts\n   now have an FQDN that returns one or more LP\

  contents:
  - "2.7.  Site Interior Topology Obfuscation\n   In some situations, it can be desirable\
    \ to obfuscate the details of\n   the interior topology of an end site.  Alternately,\

    \ described in Section 2.3 would be followed, with the\n   following additional\
    \ modification of the use of Locator values:\n   (1) Only the aggregated Locator\
    \ value, i.e., L_pp, is advertised\n       outside the site (e.g., in an L32 or\

    \ for received packets, for example, by using\n       a mapping table from I values\
    \ to either L_ss values or internal\n       Locator values.\n   (3) The SBR needs\
    \ to zero the L_ss values for all Source Locators of\n       egress packets, as\
    \ well as perform a Locator rewriting that\n       affects the L_pp bits of the\

    \ site, not\n   the exterior connectivity of the site.  In order for the site\
    \ to be\n   reachable from the global Internet, the site's DNS entries need to\n\

    \ ILNPv6, this means\n   that the SBR need not be aware if ILNPv6 is operating\
    \ as described in\n   [RFC6740] and [RFC6741].  For ILNPv4, again, the SBR need\
    \ not be\n   aware of the operation if ILNPv4 is operating as it will not need\
    \ to\n   inspect the extension header carrying the I value.\n   In order to support\

    \ addresses (for whatever reason), the\n   SBR MUST support the \"hair pinning\"\
    \ behaviour commonly used in\n   existing NAT/NAPT devices.  (This behaviour is\
    \ described in Section 6\n   of RFC 4787 [RFC4787].)\n   In the near-term, a more\
    \ common deployment scenario will be to deploy\n   ILNP incrementally, with some\
    \ ordinary classic IP traffic still\n   existing.  In this case, the SBR should\
    \ maintain flow state that\n   contains a flag for each flow indicating whether\
    \ or not that flow is\n   using ILNP.  If that flag indicated ILNP were enabled\
    \ for a given\n   flow, and ILNP local numbering were also enabled, then the SBR\
    \ would\n   know that it should perform the simpler ILNP Locator rewriting\n \
    \  mapping.  If that flag indicated ILNP were not enabled for a given\n   flow\
    \ and IP NAT or IP NAPT were also enabled, then the SBR would know\n   that it\
    \ should perform the more complex NAT/NAPT translation (e.g.,\n   including TCP\
    \ or UDP checksum recalculation).\n      NOTE: Existing commercial security-aware\
    \ routers (e.g., Juniper\n      SRX routers) already can maintain flow state for\
    \ millions of\n      concurrent IP flows.  This feature would add one flag to\
    \ each\n      flow's state, so this approach is believed scalable today using\n\
    \      existing commercial technology.\n   Those applications that do not use\
    \ IP Address values in application\n   state or configuration data are considered\
    \ to be \"well behaved\".  For\n   well-behaved applications, no further enhancements\
    \ are required.\n   Where application-layer protocols are not well behaved, for\
    \ example,\n   the File Transfer Protocol (FTP), then the SBR might need to perform\n\
    \   additional stateful processing -- just as NAT and NAPT equipment\n   needs\
    \ to do today for FTP.  See the description in Section 7.6 of\n   [RFC6741].\n\
    \   When the SBR rewrites a Locator in an ILNP packet, that obscures\n   information\
    \ about how well a particular path is working between the\n   sender and the receiver\
    \ of that ILNP packet.  So, the SBR that\n   rewrites Locator values needs to\
    \ include mechanisms to ensure that\n   any packet with a new Destination Locator\
    \ will travel along a valid\n   path to the intended destination node.  For ILNPv4,\
    \ the path liveness\n   will be no worse than IPv4, and mechanisms already in\
    \ use for IPv4\n   can be reused.  For ILNPv6, the path liveness will be no worse\
    \ than\n   for IPv6, and mechanisms already in use for IPv6 can be reused.\n \
    \  In the future, the Border Router Discovery Protocol (BRDP) also might\n   be\
    \ used in some deployments to indicate which routing prefixes are\n   currently\
    \ valid and which site border routers currently have a\n   working uplink [BRDP11].\n"

- title: 3.2.  Dealing with Link/Connectivity Changes
  contents:
  - "3.2.  Dealing with Link/Connectivity Changes\n   One of the key uses for multihoming\
    \ is providing resilience to link\n   failure.  If either link breaks, then the\
    \ SBR can manage the change\n   in connectivity locally.  For example, assume\
    \ SBR has been configured\n   to use sbr1 for all traffic, and sbr2 only as backup\
    \ link.  So, SBR\n   directs packets from H to communicate with CN using sbr1,\
    \ and CN will\n   receive packets as in expression (1b) and respond with packets\
    \ as in\n   expression (2a).\n   However, if sbr1 goes down then SBR will move\
    \ the communication to\n   interface sbr2.  As H is not aware of the actions of\
    \ the SBR, the SBR\n   must maintain some state about IL-V \"pairs\" in order\
    \ to hand off the\n   connectivity from sbr1 to sbr2.  So, when moving the communication\
    \ to\n   sbr2, the SBR would firstly send a Locator Update (LU) message\n   [RFC6745]\
    \ [RFC6743], to CN informing it that L_2 is now the valid\n   Locator for the\
    \ communication.  This operation would not be visible\n   to H, although there\
    \ might be some disruption to transmission, e.g.,\n   packets being sent from\
    \ CN to H that are in flight when sbr1 goes\n   down may be lost.  The SBR might\
    \ also need to update DNS entries (see\n   Section 3.3).  Since ILNP requires\
    \ that all Locator Update messages\n   be authenticated by the ILNP Nonce, the\
    \ SBR will need to include the\n   appropriate Nonce values as part of its cache\
    \ of information about\n   ILNP sessions traversing the SBR.  (NOTE: Since commercial\
    \ security\n   gateways available as of this writing reportedly can handle full\n\
    \   stateful packet inspection for millions of flows at multi-gigabit\n   speeds,\
    \ it should be practical for such devices to cache the ILNP\n   flow information,\
    \ including Nonce values.)\n   This approach has some efficiency gains over the\
    \ approach for\n   multihoming described in [RFC6740], where each hosts manages\
    \ its own\n   connectivity.\n   If sbr1 was to be reinstated, now with Locator\
    \ value L_3, then local\n   policy would determine if the communication should\
    \ be moved back to\n   sbr1, with appropriate additional actions, such as transmission\
    \ of LU\n   messages with the new Locator values and also the updates to DNS.\n\
    \   Note that in such movement of an ILNP session across interfaces at\n   the\
    \ SBR, only Locator values in ILNP packets are changed.  As already\n   noted\
    \ in [RFC6740], end-to-end transport-layer session state\n   invariance is maintained.\n"

  - "3.3.  SBR Updates to DNS\n   When the SBR manages connectivity as described above,\
    \ the internal\n   hosts, such as H, are not necessarily aware of any connectivity\n\

    \  So, if H was a server expecting incoming connections, the SBR\n   must update\
    \ the relevant DNS entries when the site connectivity\n   changes.\n   There are\
    \ two possibilities: each host could have its own L32 or L64\n   records; or the\
    \ site might use a combination of LP and L32/L64\n   records (see Section 2.4).\
    \  Either way, the SBR would need to update\n   the relevant DNS entries.  For\
    \ our example, with ILNPv6 and LP\n   records in use, the SBR would need to manage\
    \ two L64 records (one for\n   each uplink) that would resolve from a FQDN, for\

    \ need to know to\n   use L_2 and not L_1.  L_1 and L_2 would be stored in DNS\
    \ records\n   (e.g., L32 for ILNPv4 or L64 for ILNPv6).  If a remote host has\n\
    \   already resolved from DNS that L_1 is the correct Locator for sending\n  \
    \ packets to the site, then that host might be holding stale\n   information.\n\
    \   DNS allows values returned to be aged using Time-To-Live (TTL), which\n  \
    \ is specified in the time unit of seconds.  So that remote nodes do\n   not hold\
    \ on to stale values from DNS, the L64 records for our site\n   should have low\
    \ TTL values.  An appropriate value must be considered\n   carefully.  For example,\
    \ let us assume that the site administrator\n   knows that when sbr1 fails, it\
    \ takes 20 seconds to failover to sbr2.\n   Then, 20 s would seem to be an appropriate\
    \ time to use for the TTL\n   value of an L64 for the site: if a remote node had\
    \ just resolved the\n   value L_1 for the site, and the link to sbr1 went down,\
    \ that remote\n   node would not hold the stale value of L_1 for any longer than\
    \ it\n   takes the site to failover to sbr2 and use L_2.\n   Our studies for a\
    \ university school site network show that low TTL\n   values, as low as zero,\
    \ are feasible for operational use [BA11].\n   NOTE: From 01 November 2010, the\
    \ site network of the School of\n         Computer Science, University of St Andrews,\
    \ UK, has been\n         running operational DNS with DNS A records that have\
    \ TTL of\n         zero.  At the time of writing of this document (November 2012),\n\
    \         a zero DNS TTL was still in use at the school.\n"

    \ local numbering, and the\n   SBR would send LU messages for H (for any correspondent\
    \ nodes, not\n   shown in Figure 4.1), and would update DNS entries as required.\n\
    \   The difference to the S-MH scenario described earlier in this\n   document\
    \ is that in the situation of Figure 4.1b, the SBR can opt to\n   use soft handover\
    \ has previously described in [RFC6740].\n   Again, there is an efficiency gain\
    \ compared to the situation\n   described in [RFC6740]: the SBR provides a convenient\
    \ point at which\n   to centrally manage the movement of the site as a whole.\
    \  Note that\n   in Figure 4.1b, the site is multihomed.\n   As for S-MH, L_1\
    \ and L_2 could be advertised internally, as a local\n   policy decision, for\
    \ those hosts that require direct control of their\n   connectivity.\n   Note\
    \ that for handover, immediate handover will have a similar\n   behaviour to a\
    \ link outage as described for S-MH.  However, as ILNP\n   allows soft-handover,\
    \ during the handover period, this should help to\n   reduce (perhaps even remove)\
    \ packet loss.\n"

    \ subject to local policy, to try to\n   control load across the external links.\
    \  For example, it could be\n   configured initially with the following mappings:\n\
    \     srcI=I_1, sbr1                                        --- (3a)\n     srcI=I_2,\

    \                                      --- (3c)\n   These mappings direct packets\
    \ matching course Identifier values to\n   particular outgoing interfaces.  As\
    \ load changes, these mappings\n   could be changed.  For example, expression\
    \ (3c) could be changed to:\n     srcI=I_3, sbr2                             \
    \           --- (4)\n   and the SBR would need to send LU message to the correspondents\
    \ of H3\n   (sbr to uses L_2 while sbr1 uses L_1).  The egress connectivity is\n\
    \   totally within control of the SBR under administrative policy, as\n   already\
    \ seen in the descriptions of multihoming and mobility in this\n   document.\n\
    \   Of course, more complex policies are possible, based on:\n    - whether ILNP\
    \ sessions are incoming or outgoing\n    - time of day\n    - internal subnets\n\
    \   and any number of criteria already in use for control of traffic.\n   In expressions\

    \ could be used\n    - source or destination L values could be used\n    - mappings\
    \ could be to L values, not to specific interfaces\n   and, again, any number\
    \ of criteria could be used to manipulate the\n   packet path, based on filtering\
    \ of values in header fields and local\n   policy.\n   With ILNP, hosts do not\
    \ need to be aware of the operation of the SBR\n   in this manner.\n   Note, again,\
    \ that in this scenario, there is nothing to prevent SBR\n   from also advertising\
    \ L_1 and L_2 into the site network.  If\n   required, administrative controls\
    \ could be used to enable selective\n   hosts in the site network to use L_1 and\

    \ is great\n   potential for it to be used in datacentre scenarios.  Further details\n\
    \   of possibilities are in [BA12], with a summary presented here.\n   There are\
    \ several scenarios that could be beneficial to datacentres,\n   in order to provide\
    \ functions such as load balancing, resilience and\n   fault tolerance, and resource\
    \ management:\n   - Same datacentre, internal Virtual Machine (VM) mobility: This\
    \ could\n     be beneficial in load balancing, dynamically, where load changes\n\
    \     are taking place.  The remote user does not see the VM has moved.\n   -\
    \ Different datacentres, transparent mobility: This is where the\n     datacentre\
    \ resources may be geographically distributed, but the\n     geographical movement\
    \ is transparent to the remote user.\n   - Different datacentres, mobility is\
    \ visible: This is where the\n     datacentre resources may be geographically\
    \ distributed, but the\n     geographical movement is visible to the remote user.\n\
    \   These are three situations that may be supported by ILNP, but they\n   are\
    \ not the only ones: we provide these here as examples, and they\n   are not intended\
    \ to be prescriptive.  The intention is only to show\n   the flexibility that\
    \ is possible through the use of ILNP.\n   This section describes some Virtual\
    \ Machine (VM) mobility\n   capabilities that are possible with ILNP.  Depending\
    \ on the internal\n   details and virtualisation model provided by a VM platform,\
    \ it might\n   be sufficient for the guest operating system to support ILNP. \
    \ In\n   some cases, again depending on the internal details and\n   virtualisation\

    \ be beneficial, for a number of reasons, for\n   communication to V to be routed\
    \ via SBR2 rather than SBR1.\n   When V moves from site network 1 to site network\
    \ 2, this visibility\n   of mobility could be by V sending ILNP Locator Update\
    \ messages to the\n   CN during the mobility process.  Also, V would update any\

    \ Relay\n     Figure 7.1: Locator Rewriting Relay (LRR) Example\n   The operation\
    \ of the LRR is conceptually very simple.  We assume that\n   the LRR first has\
    \ mappings as given in expressions (7b) and (7c) (see\n   next subsection).  Expression\
    \ (7b) says that for packets with src\n   IL-V [I_H, L_1], the packet's source\
    \ Locator value should be\n   rewritten to value L_X and then forwarded.  Expression\
    \ (7c) has the\n   complimentary mapping for packets with destination IL-V [I_H,\
    \ L_1]\n   (for the reverse direction).\n   Expression (6a) is a UDP/ILNP packet\
    \ as might be sent in Figure 2.1\n   from H to CN.  However, instead of going\
    \ directly to L_CN, the packet\n   with destination Locator L_1 goes to a LRR.\
    \  Expression (7d) is the\n   result of the mapping of packet (7a) using expression\
    \ (7b).\n   Note that it is entirely possible that the packet of expression (7d)\n\
    \   then is processed by another LRR for source Locator value L_X.\n   Effectively,\
    \ this creates and LRR path for the packet, as an overlay\n   path on top of the\
    \ normal IP routing.\n   In this way, there is a level of protection, without\
    \ the need for\n   cryptographic techniques, for the (topological) Location of\
    \ the\n   packet.  Of course, an extremely well-resourced adversary could,\n \
    \  potentially, backtrack the LRR path, but, depending on the LRR\n   overlay\
    \ path that is created, could be very difficult to trace in\n   reality.  For\
    \ example, the mechanism will protect against off-path\n   attacks, but where\
    \ the threat regime includes the potential for on-\n   path attacks, cryptographically\
    \ protected tunnels between H and LRR\n   might be required.\n   Again, as the\
    \ Locator value is not part of the end-to-end state, this\n   mechanism is very\
    \ general and has a low overhead.\n"
- title: 7.2.  Options for Installing LRR Packet Forwarding State
  contents:
  - "7.2.  Options for Installing LRR Packet Forwarding State\n   There are many options\
    \ for managing the \"network\" of LRRs that could\n   be in place if such a system\
    \ was used on a large scale, including the\n   setting up and removal of LRR state\
    \ for packet relaying, as for\n   expressions (7b) and (7c).  We consider this\
    \ function to be outside\n   the scope of these ILNP specifications, but note\
    \ that there are many\n   existing mechanisms that could modified for use, and\
    \ also many\n   possibilities for new mechanisms that would be specific to the\
    \ use of\n   ILNP LRRs.\n   (Note also that the control/management communication\
    \ with the LRR\n   does not need to use ILNP: IPv4 or IPv6 could be used.)\n \
    \  The host, H, by itself could install the required state, assuming it\n   was\
    \ aware of suitable information to contact the LRR.  The first\n   packet in an\
    \ ILNP session might contain a header option called a\n   Locator Redirection\
    \ Option (LRO).  The LRO would contain the Locator\n   value that should be rewritten\
    \ into the source Locator of the packet.\n   When a LRR receives such a packet,\
    \ it would install the required\n   state.  Such a mechanism could be soft-state,\
    \ requiring periodic use\n   of the LRO in order to maintain the state in the\
    \ LRR.  The LRO could\n   also be delivered using an ICMP ECHO packet sent from\
    \ H to the LRR,\n   periodically, again to maintain a soft-state update.\n   It\
    \ would, of course, be prudent to protect the LRR state control\n   packets with\
    \ some sort of authentication token, to prevent an\n   adversary from easily installing\
    \ false LRR state and causing packets\n   from H or its correspondent to be subject\
    \ to man-in-the-middle\n   attacks, or black-holing.  Again, such attacks are\
    \ not specific to\n   ILNP or new to ILNP.\n   It would also be possible to use\
    \ proprietary application level\n   protocols, with strong authentication for\
    \ the control of the LRR\n   state.  For example, an application level protocol\
    \ based on XMPP\n   (http://xmpp.org/) operating over SSL.\n   Above, we have\
    \ offered very brief and incomplete descriptions of some\n   possibilities, and\
    \ we do not necessarily mandate any one of them:\n   they serve only as examples.\n"
