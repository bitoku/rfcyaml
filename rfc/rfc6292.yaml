  - "1.  Introduction\n   [RFC2418] describes the guidelines and procedures for formation\
    \ and\n   operation of IETF Working Groups (WGs).  Since the publication of RFC\n\
    \   2418 in 1998, the IETF has started many dozen new WGs, and has shut\n   down\
    \ many dozen.  In that time, many WGs have had some (often dozens)\n   changes\
    \ to their charters.\n   Today, virtually all of the tasks associated with creating,\n\
    \   rechartering, and closing a WG are performed manually.  An Area\n   Director\
    \ (AD) requests one of these actions by manually sending a\n   message to the\
    \ Secretariat's ticket system.  A member of the\n   Secretariat staff manually\
    \ updates the internal Secretariat database\n   and the IETF Datatracker, manually\
    \ places the WG on the IESG\n   teleconference agenda (when appropriate), and\
    \ manually sends out all\n   of the required messages and announcements.\n   The\
    \ IETF Administrative Oversight Committee (IAOC) would like to\n   create a better\
    \ tool for those tasks, and this document lists the\n   requirements for such\
    \ a tool.  When complete, this document may be\n   used to issue an RFP for the\
    \ design and development of the tool.\n   This document was prepared at the request\
    \ of the IAOC.\n"
- title: 1.1.  WG Charter Process Overview
  contents:
  - "1.1.  WG Charter Process Overview\n   As described in [RFC2418], a key responsibility\
    \ of the IESG is the\n   creation, re-chartering, and closing of WGs.  Creation\
    \ and\n   rechartering of WGs is a multi-step process that involves internal\n\
    \   review of a draft charter by the IESG and IAB, an external review of\n   the\
    \ draft charter by the IETF community and by other standards\n   bodies, and (likely)\
    \ approval of a final charter by the IESG.  The\n   internal review by the IESG\
    \ and IAB, and the external review by the\n   IETF community, often result in\
    \ revisions to the draft charter.\n   Closing of a WG does not require review\
    \ or approval by the IESG.\n   Rather, a WG may be closed at the request of an\
    \ AD, normally the Area\n   Advisor for the WG.\n   Note that the charter and\
    \ recharter processes do not involve changing\n   of WG milestones.  A tool that\
    \ handles milestone updates will likely\n   be created in the future.\n"
- title: 2.  General Requirements
  contents:
  - "2.  General Requirements\n   The tool described here holds records for new WGs\
    \ that are being\n   considered as well as for all WGs whose charter are under\
    \ review.\n"
- title: 2.1.  WG Records
  contents:
  - "2.1.  WG Records\n   A WG record contains the following fields:\n   o  name of\
    \ the WG\n   o  the WG's acronym\n   o  names of the WG chairs (if known)\n  \
    \ o  names of the WG secretary (if any)\n   o  names of the WG technical advisors\
    \ (if any)\n   o  shepherding AD\n   o  IETF area\n   o  charter text\n   o  mailing\
    \ list address and archive location\n   o  previous mailing list (if any)\n  \
    \ o  other web sites (such as wikis, trackers, and/or project sites, if\n    \
    \  any) including web sites existing prior to the WG formation\n   o  earlier\
    \ acronyms for the WG\n   o  explanation for why the WG is being chartered or\
    \ rechartered (if\n      any)\n   In addition, a WG record contains the state\
    \ of the WG in the review\n   process.  That state has one annotation: whether\
    \ or not the state is\n   for a proposed WG or for an existing WG undergoing rechartering.\n\
    \   Some changes in state cause messages to be sent to the Secretariat so\n  \
    \ that the Secretariat can perform additional steps, such as sending\n   out mail\
    \ to various parties about the latest version of the charter\n   text, deadlines\
    \ for an upcoming decision, and so on.\n   When a WG record is displayed, that\
    \ display should also reflect\n   whether the WG currently exists or has been\
    \ closed; that data comes\n   from a different part of the Datatracker database.\n\
    \   Any AD can modify fields in an existing WG record.  Any AD can use\n   the\
    \ tool to change the review state of a WG record.  The normal order\n   for steps\
    \ is shown in this document, but an AD can set the state to\n   any valid value\
    \ at any time.\n"
- title: 2.2.  Comments
  contents:
  - "2.2.  Comments\n   During the reviews for WG creation and rechartering, ADs can\
    \ comment\n   on the reviews.  Any AD can add a comment to the record of a WG\
    \ that\n   is under review.  Each comment can be flagged as either \"blocking\"\
    \n   (meaning blocking forward movement until it is resolved) and \"non-\n   blocking\"\
    \ (meaning that it is only informative or editorial).\n"
- title: 2.3.  Naming of Charter Text Proposals
  contents:
  - "2.3.  Naming of Charter Text Proposals\n   Charter text proposals are to be kept\
    \ for historical purposes.  They\n   are kept in files with a specific naming\
    \ pattern.  The pattern for\n   charters before a WG is formed is:\n   charter-ietf-wgacronym-nn[-mm]\n\
    \   o  \"wgacronym\" is the acronym of the proposed WG.\n   o  \"nn\" is a two-digit\
    \ charter number assigned in sequence.  It\n      starts at \"00\" for before\
    \ the WG is first chartered; the first\n      finished charter has a value of\
    \ \"01\".\n   o  \"mm\" is a two-digit proposal number assigned in sequence. \
    \ It\n      starts at \"00\" for the first proposal for a particular version of\n\
    \      charter.  It is omitted in the actual charter file.\n   For instance, if\
    \ the \"example\" WG is chartered and then rechartered\n   twice, you might have\
    \ the following sequence of files:\n   charter-ietf-example-00-00.txt (first proposal)\n\
    \   charter-ietf-example-00-01.txt (second proposal)\n   charter-ietf-example-00-02.txt\
    \ (third proposal)\n   charter-ietf-example-01.txt (first charter)\n   charter-ietf-example-01-00.txt\
    \ (first recharter proposal)\n   charter-ietf-example-01-01.txt (second recharter\
    \ proposal)\n   charter-ietf-example-01-02.txt (third recharter proposal)\n  \
    \ charter-ietf-example-02.txt (second charter)\n   charter-ietf-example-02-00.txt\
    \ (next recharter proposal)\n   . . .\n   charter-ietf-example-03.txt (third charter)\n"
- title: 2.4.  Wording of Announcements
  contents:
  - "2.4.  Wording of Announcements\n   An AD can view and edit the standard \"WG\
    \ Review\" and \"WG Action\"\n   announcements before they are sent out during\
    \ the WG creation,\n   rechartering, and closing processes.  If the AD edits the\
    \ message,\n   the Secretariat is alerted to that fact when they receive the\n\
    \   request.\n"
- title: 2.5.  Access to the Tool
  contents:
  - "2.5.  Access to the Tool\n   Area Directors and the IETF Secretariat currently\
    \ have access to\n   perform some actions in the Datatracker that other community\
    \ members\n   do not; this access control continues to be used in many of the\n\
    \   extensions listed in this document.  Further, the IETF Secretariat\n   can\
    \ perform all actions that can be performed by any AD in this tool.\n"
- title: 2.6.  Initializing the Tool
  contents:
  - "2.6.  Initializing the Tool\n   Records for all WGs that are being created, or\
    \ are in the process of\n   charter updates, will be added before the tool is\
    \ first publicly\n   deployed.\n   The database should also be initialized with\
    \ current and historical\n   data, namely as much information as is currently\
    \ known about existing\n   and closed WGs that can be done in a mostly-automated\
    \ fashion.\n"

- title: 3.1.  Chartering a New WG
  contents:
  - "3.1.  Chartering a New WG\n   Any AD can create a new WG record using a simple\
    \ web form.  Creating\n   a record should succeed as long as there is no other\
    \ WG with the same\n   name.  Names must be unique, so the tool will warn the\
    \ AD if the\n   acronym that is being proposed has been used in earlier WG charter\n\
    \   proposals and suggest against its use for a new charter.  By default,\n  \
    \ the field in the form listing the shepherding AD will be prepopulated\n   with\
    \ the name of the AD who is filling in the form.  The AD can fill\n   in all the\
    \ fields for the proposed WG.  The names of the WG chairs\n   can be left off\
    \ during the initial chartering process.\n   (Some Secretariat tools have trouble\
    \ with acronyms of more than eight\n   characters: they truncate the name.  This\
    \ will probably be fixed in\n   the future.  The new tool should have a configuration\
    \ setting that is\n   set to 8 initially, and it should be adjusted when the Secretariat\n\
    \   tools are updated.  There may also be problems with names that have\n   hyphens\
    \ in them.  However, WGs that have more than eight characters\n   in their names,\
    \ and WGs with hyphens in their names, have existed for\n   over a year.)\n  \
    \ Creating a new WG record causes the Datatracker state for this\n   potential\
    \ new WG to be \"Informal IESG review\".  When the record is\n   created, the\
    \ AD proposes a length of time (in weeks) for the internal\n   review time; the\
    \ default is one week.\n   The review states in which a WG can exist during its\
    \ initial\n   chartering are:\n   o  Informal IESG review -- This is the initial\
    \ state, moved into by\n      the tool when an AD creates a WG record.  When the\
    \ WG record is\n      moved to this state, a message is sent to the Secretariat.\
    \  The\n      normal next state is \"Internal review\" if the idea is accepted,\
    \ or\n      \"Not currently under review\" if the idea is abandoned.  The tool\n\
    \      should prompt the AD if they try to move to the next state in less\n  \
    \    than the minimum elapsed time set by the AD when creating the WG,\n     \
    \ but allow the move if the AD responds to the prompt.\n   o  Internal review\
    \ -- The IESG and IAB are reviewing the early draft\n      of the charter; this\
    \ is the initial IESG and IAB review.  When\n      moved to this state, a note\
    \ is sent to the Secretariat to place\n      this on the next IESG telechat and\
    \ to inform the IAB.  The usual\n      next state is \"External review\" if the\
    \ idea is adopted, or\n      \"Informal IESG review\" if the IESG decides the\
    \ idea needs more\n      work, or \"Not currently under review\" if the idea is\
    \ abandoned.\n   o  External review -- The IETF community and possibly other standards\n\
    \      development organizations (SDOs) are reviewing the proposed\n      charter.\
    \  When moved to this state, a note is sent to the\n      Secretariat to send\
    \ out the external review announcement to the\n      appropriate lists.  The external\
    \ review announcement will be sent\n      out to the normal IETF-related mailing\
    \ lists.  The AD can specify\n      whether or not to send the announcement to\
    \ other SDOs (with the\n      default being that it should be), and the AD can\
    \ also specify\n      additional recipients who should receive the announcement.\
    \  When\n      moved to this state, a separate note is sent to the Secretariat\
    \ to\n      schedule discussion for the next IESG telechat.  The usual next\n\
    \      state is \"IESG review\", although it might move to \"Not currently\n \
    \     under review\" if the idea is abandoned during the external review.\n  \
    \ o  IESG review -- The IESG is reviewing the discussion from the\n      external\
    \ review of the proposed charter.  The usual next state is\n      \"WG exists\"\
    , or \"Not currently under review\" if the idea is\n      abandoned.\n   o  WG\
    \ exists -- The WG was approved by the IESG.  When moved to this\n      state,\
    \ a note is sent to the Secretariat to publish the charter\n      and send the\
    \ appropriate announcements.  The WG remains in this\n      state until there\
    \ is a request to update the charter.\n   o  Not currently under review -- The\
    \ proposed WG is not being\n      considered at this time.  A proposed WG charter\
    \ will remain in\n      this state until an AD moves it to \"Informa1 IESG review\"\
    .\n   All states above, except for \"WG exists\", are given the annotation\n \
    \  \"Initial chartering\".\n   The chartering process involves the proposed charter\
    \ appearing on two\n   IESG telechats.  The tool should allow an AD and/or the\
    \ Secretariat\n   to select the telechat date for the approval events.  When the\n\
    \   telechat is selected, the state determines where it appears on that\n   telechat's\
    \ agenda.\n"
- title: 3.2.  Rechartering an Existing WG
  contents:
  - "3.2.  Rechartering an Existing WG\n   Any AD can request that a WG be rechartered\
    \ using a simple web form.\n   This form prompts with the current charter and\
    \ allows all fields to\n   be edited.  Asking for a recharter causes the Datatracker\
    \ state for\n   this WG to be \"Informal IESG review\".  When the recharter record\
    \ is\n   created, the AD proposes a length of time (in weeks) for the internal\n\
    \   review time; the default is one week.\n   The review states in which a WG\
    \ can exist during rechartering are:\n   o  WG exists; Informal IESG recharter\

    \ to the normal IETF-\n      related mailing lists.  The AD can specify whether\
    \ or not to send\n      the announcement to other SDOs (with the default being\
    \ that it\n      should be), and the AD can also specify additional recipients\

  - "5.2.  Seeing Differences between Versions of Pre-Approval Wordings\n   It needs\
    \ to be easy to compare differences between different versions\n   of proposed\
    \ charter language, up to and including the approved\n   version.  Using the naming\
    \ formats given in Section 2, this means\n   that it must be easy to compare wgacronym-charter-ss\
    \ (for the highest\n   value of \"ss\") with wgacronym-recharter-ss-nn.  It must\
    \ also be\n   possible to compare any two versions of approved charters (that\
    \ is,\n   of two values for \"ss\" in wgacronym-charter-ss).  It also must be\n\
    \   easy to compare two versions that have different acronyms in the case\n  \
    \ that the acronym changes during the chartering process.\n"
