  - "Abstract\n   Two common ways to communicate timezone information are POSIX 1003.1\n\
    \   timezone strings and timezone database names.  This memo specifies\n   DHCP\
    \ options for each of those methods.  The DHCPv4 time offset\n   option is deprecated.\n"
- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   This memo specifies a means to provide hosts with more accurate\n\
    \   timezone information than was previously available.  To do this we\n   make\
    \ use of two commonly used methods to configure timezones:\n   o  POSIX TZ strings\n\
    \   o  Reference to the name of the time zone entry in the TZ Database\n   POSIX\
    \ [1] provides a standard for how to express timezone information\n   in a character\
    \ string.  Use of such a string can provide accuracy for\n   at least one transition\
    \ into and out of daylight saving time (DST),\n   and possibly for more transitions\
    \ if the transitions are regular\n   enough (e.g., \"second Sunday in March at\
    \ 02:00 local time\").\n   However, for accuracy over longer periods that involve\
    \ daylight-\n   saving rule changes or other irregular changes, a more detailed\n\
    \   mechanism is necessary.\n   The TZ Database [7] that is used in many operating\
    \ systems provides\n   backwards consistency and accuracy for almost all real-world\n\
    \   locations since 1970.  The TZ database also attempts to provide a\n   stable\
    \ set of human readable timezone identifiers.  In addition, many\n   systems already\
    \ make use of the TZ database, and so the names used\n   are a de facto standard.\
    \  Because the TZ database contains more\n   information, one can heuristically\
    \ derive the POSIX information from\n   a TZ identifier (see [10] for an example),\
    \ but the converse is not\n   true.\n   The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\",\
    \ \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\"\
    , \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n   document are to be interpreted as described\
    \ in RFC 2119 [2].\n"
- title: 1.1.  Related Work
  contents:
  - "1.1.  Related Work\n   Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) [3] provides\
    \ a means for\n   hosts to receive configuration information relating to their\
    \ current\n   location within an IP version 4 network. [5] similarly does so for\
    \ IP\n   version 6 networks.  RFC 2132 [4] specifies an option to provide\n  \
    \ client timezone information in the form of an offset in seconds from\n   UTC.\
    \  The information provided in that option is insufficient for the\n   client\
    \ to determine whether it is in daylight saving time, and when\n   to change into\
    \ and out of daylight saving time.  In order for the\n   client to properly represent\
    \ local wall clock time in a consistent\n   and accurate fashion the DHCP server\
    \ would have to time lease\n   expirations of affected clients to the beginning\
    \ or end of DST, thus\n   effecting a self stress test (to say the least) at the\
    \ appointed\n   hour.\n   In addition, an offset is not sufficient to determine\
    \ the actual\n   timezone in which a client resides, and thus there is no means\
    \ to\n   derive a human readable abbreviation such as \"EST\" or \"EDT\".\n  \
    \ VTIMEZONE elements are defined in the iCalendar specification [9].\n   Fully\
    \ specified they provide a level of accuracy similar to the TZ\n   database. \
    \ However, because there is currently no global registry of\n   VTIMEZONE TZIDs\
    \ (although one has been proposed; see [8]), complete\n   accuracy requires that\
    \ a full entry must be specified.  To achieve\n   the same information would range\
    \ from 300 octets upwards with no\n   particular bound.  Furthermore, at the time\
    \ of this writing the\n   authors are aware of no operating system that natively\
    \ takes\n   advantage of VTIMEZONE entries.  It might be possible to include an\n\
    \   option for a TZURL.  However, in a cold start environment, it will be\n  \
    \ bad enough that devices are stressing the DHCP server, and perhaps\n   unwise\
    \ to similarly afflict other components.\n"

- title: 4.  The TZ POSIX String
  contents:
  - "4.  The TZ POSIX String\n   TZ POSIX string is a string suitable for the TZ variable\
    \ as specified\n   by [1] in Section 8.3, with the exception that a string may\
    \ not begin\n   with a colon (\":\").  This string is NOT terminated by an ASCII\
    \ NULL.\n   Here is an example:\n   EST5EDT4,M3.2.0/02:00,M11.1.0/02:00\n   In\
    \ this case, the string is interpreted as a timezone that is\n   normally five\
    \ hours behind UTC, and four hours behind UTC during DST,\n   which runs from\
    \ the second Sunday in March at 02:00 local time\n   through the first Sunday\
    \ in November at 02:00 local time.  Normally\n   the timezone is abbreviated \"\
    EST\" but during DST it is abbreviated\n   \"EDT\".\n   Clients and servers implementing\
    \ other timezone options MUST support\n   this option for basic compatibility.\n"
- title: 5.  The TZ Name
  contents:
  - "5.  The TZ Name\n   TZ Name is the name of a Zone entry in the database commonly\
    \ referred\n   to as the TZ database.  Specifically, in the database's textual\
    \ form,\n   the string refers to the name field of a zone line.  In order for\n\
    \   this option to be useful, the client must already have a copy of the\n   database.\
    \  This string is NOT terminated with an ASCII NULL.\n   An example string is\
    \ Europe/Zurich.\n   Clients must already have a copy of the TZ Database for this\
    \ option\n   to be useful.  Configuration of the database is beyond the scope\
    \ of\n   this document.  A client that supports this option SHOULD prefer this\n\
    \   option to POSIX string if it recognizes the TZ Name that was\n   returned.\
    \  If it doesn't recognize the TZ Name, the client MUST\n   ignore this option.\n"
- title: 6.  Use of the Timezone String(s) Returned from the Server
  contents:
  - "6.  Use of the Timezone String(s) Returned from the Server\n   This specification\
    \ presumes the DHCP server has some means of\n   identifying which timezone the\
    \ client is in.  One obvious approach\n   would be to associate a subnet or group\
    \ of subnets with a timezone,\n   and respond with this option accordingly.\n\
    \   When considering which option to implement on a client, one must\n   choose\
    \ between the TZ Name, which should be easier for users to\n   configure and which\
    \ provides accuracy over longer historical periods,\n   and the TZ POSIX string,\
    \ which does not require regular updating of a\n   copy of the TZ Database.  The\
    \ TZ Name is better for most uses, in\n   particular those cases where the timezone\
    \ name might persist in a\n   database for long periods of time, but the TZ POSIX\
    \ string may be\n   more suitable for small-footprint applications that are expertly\n\
    \   maintained.\n   So that clients need not request both options, servers who\
    \ implement\n   either timezone option SHOULD implement the other one as well.\
    \  This\n   association can be established by the server's administrator.  A\n\
    \   basic server can transmit option values to the client without parsing\n  \
    \ or validating them.  A more advanced server might have a copy of the\n   TZ\
    \ database and validate TZ names against this copy, or derive TZ\n   POSIX strings\
    \ heuristically from TZ names to simplify administration.\n   As a matter of practicality,\
    \ the client will use this information at\n   its discretion to configure the\
    \ current timezone in which it resides.\n   It will periodically be necessary\
    \ for a DHCP server to update the\n   timezone string, based on administrative\
    \ changes made by local\n   jurisdictions (say, for instance, counties in Indiana).\
    \  While the\n   authors do not expect this to be a lower bound on a lease time\
    \ in the\n   vast majority of cases, there may be times when anticipation of a\n\
    \   change dictates prudence, as certain governments give little if any\n   notification.\n\
    \   The effect of a changed timezone on client applications is not\n   specified\
    \ by this memo, but it may be helpful to note common problems\n   in this area.\
    \  Often, client applications consult the timezone\n   setting only during process\
    \ initialization, or inherit the setting\n   from a parent process, so existing\
    \ processes on a client may ignore a\n   timezone change returned from the server.\
    \  Sometimes it is normal and\n   expected for processes on the same client to\
    \ have different timezone\n   settings (e.g., remote logins), and so client implementations\
    \ should\n   consider these ramifications of changing timezone settings of\n \
    \  existing processes.\n"
- title: 7.  The New Timezone Option and Lease Times
  contents:
  - "7.  The New Timezone Option and Lease Times\n   When a lease has expired and\
    \ new information is not forthcoming, the\n   client MAY continue to use timezone\
    \ information returned by the\n   server.  This follows the principle of least\
    \ astonishment.\n"
- title: 8.  Deprecation of Time Offset Option
  contents:
  - "8.  Deprecation of Time Offset Option\n   Because this option provides a superset\
    \ of functionality to the\n   previous IPv4 time offset option (tag 2), and in\
    \ order to maintain\n   consistency between IPv4 and IPv6 implementation, the\
    \ older option is\n   deprecated.  Current implementations that support the time\
    \ offset\n   IPv4 option SHOULD implement this option also.  Other implementations\n\
    \   SHOULD implement this option, and SHOULD NOT implement the time\n   offset\
    \ IPv4 option.  As a matter of transition, clients that already\n   use the time\
    \ offset option MAY request the time offset option and the\n   timezone option.\n"
- title: 9.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "9.  Security Considerations\n   An attacker could provide erroneous information\
    \ to a client.  It is\n   possible that someone might miss a meeting or otherwise\
    \ show up\n   early, or that heavy machinery or other critical functions might\
    \ act\n   at the wrong time or fail to act.  If clients have job processing\n\
    \   tools, such as cron that operate on wall clock time, it is possible\n   that\
    \ certain jobs could be triggered either earlier or later, or even\n   repeated\
    \ or skipped entirely if scheduled during a DST transition.\n   In such cases,\
    \ the client operating system might do well to confirm\n   timezone changes with\
    \ a human.\n   Clients using the POSIX option should beware of any time zone setting\n\
    \   specifying unusual characters (e.g., control characters) in the\n   standard\
    \ or daylight-saving abbreviations, as this might well trigger\n   security-relevant\
    \ bugs in applications.\n   Clients using the POSIX option should also be suspicious\
    \ of any\n   timezone setting whose UTC offset exceeds 25 hours (the POSIX limit,\n\
    \   if the default daylight-saving offset is used).  As of this writing,\n   the\
    \ maximum UTC offset is 14 hours in practice, but governments may\n   extend this\
    \ somewhat in the future.\n"
