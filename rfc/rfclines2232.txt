This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB) for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
In particular, it defines objects for monitoring and controlling network devices with DLUR (Dependent LU Requester) capabilities.
This memo identifies managed objects for the DLUR protocol.
The SNMP Network Management Framework
The SNMP Network Management Framework consists of several components.
For the purpose of this specification, the applicable components of the Framework are the SMI and related documents [1, 2, 3], which define the mechanisms used for describing and naming objects for the purpose of management.
The Framework permits new objects to be defined for the purpose of experimentation and evaluation.
This document identifies objects for monitoring the configuration and active characteristics of devices with DLUR capabilities.
Dependent LU requester/server (DLUR/S) is an extension to the Advanced Peer  to Peer Networking (APPN) architecture that provides dependent LU services in APPN networks.
See the SNANAU APPN MIB [4] for management of APPN networks.
The base APPN architecture only provided for transport of data between independent logical units (LUs).
However, customers have an enormous investment in applications based on dependent LU types.
DLUR/S provides for support of dependent LU sessions in an APPN network.
A dependent LU server (DLUS) is an APPN node that provides System Services Control Point (SSCP) services over an APPN network to remote secondary dependent LUs by using SSCP PU (physical unit) and SSCP LU sessions whose flows are encapsulated on LU 6.2 session flows between the DLUS node and
the appropriate dependent LU requester (DLUR) node.
The secondary dependent LUs may be local to the DLUR node, or in adjacent type 2.0 or 2.1 nodes.
The LU 6.2 control sessions between a DLUS node and a DLUR node are referred to as a CPSVRMGR pipe.
CPSVRMGR refers to the mode used for the sessions.
In this document, we describe DLUR managed objects.
The DLUR terms and overall architecture are described in [5].
Changing the state of control session to the DLUS
this node is supporting    Traps.
The APPN MIB contains a trap for Alert conditions that may affect DLUR resources.
The value for the affectedObject object contained in the alertTrap is determined by the implementation.
It may contain a VariablePointer from the DLUR MIB.
The APPN/DLUR Alerts are defined in [6].
Although DLUR is an extension to APPN, the DLUR MIB relies very little upon the APPN MIB.
The dlurNodeCpName object in this MIB has the same value as the appnNodeCpName object in the APPN MIB.
If the dlurPuLsName object in the MIB has the same value as the appnLsName object in the APPN MIB, then the two objects are referring to the same link station.
dlurPuInfo objects describing the PUs that this APPN node is supporting with DLUR.
dlurDlusInfo objects describing the control sessions with DLUSs.
These are described below in more detail.
The dlurNodeInfo group consists of the following objects and table:
These objects represent the capabilities and options of the DLUR implementation, such as the release level of the implementation 2) dlurDefaultDefBackupDlusTable
This table identifies the list of defined backup DLUSs for all PUs served by this DLUR, if there is no specific DLUS backup list for the PU.
The list is in descending order of preference as a backup DLUS.
The dlurPuInfo group consists of the following tables: 1) dlurPuTable This table has an entry for each PU this node is supporting via DLUR, including the locally known name,
the SSCP supplied name (if known), and the PU status.
This table contains the backup DLUS list defined on a PU basis.
The table has an entry for each specifically defined backup DLUS on each PU.
The first index to the entry is the PU name, which organizes the table by PU name.
The second index is a ranking which further sorts the table in descending order of preference as a backup DLUS for the PU.
If a PU name is not found in this table, the dlurDefaultDefBackupDlusNameTable is used as a backup list for that PU.
This group consists of the following table: 1) dlurDlusTable
This table contains information about the control sessions (CPSVRMGR pipes) with the DLUS, including the control point (CP) name of the DLUS and the status of the control session.

This is the MIB module for objects used to manage network devices with DLUR capabilities.
This MIB contains information that is useful for managing an APPN product that implements a DLUR (Dependent Logical Unit Requester).
The DLUR product has a client/server relationship with an APPN product that implements a DLUS (Dependent Logical Unit Server)."
This group represents the capabilities and options of the DLUR    implementation.

If this object has the same value as the appnNodeCpName object in the APPN MIB, then the two objects are referring to the same APPN node."
{ dlurNodeCapabilities 1 } dlurReleaseLevel OBJECT
MAX ACCESS read only STATUS current DESCRIPTION "
The DLUR release level of this implementation.
This is the value that is encoded in the DLUR/DLUS Capabilites (CV 51).
To insure consistent display, this one byte value is encoded here as two displayable characters that are equivalent to a hexadecimal display.
For example, if the one byte value as encoded in CV51 is X'01', this object will contain the displayable string '01'."
MAX ACCESS read only STATUS current DESCRIPTION "Automatic Network Shutdown (ANS) capability of this node.
'continueOrStop' indicates that the DLUR implementation supports either ANS value (continue or stop) as specified by the DLUS on ACTPU for each PU.
'stopOnly' indicates that the DLUR implementation only supports the ANS value of stop.
ANS   continue means that the DLUR node will keep LU LU sessions active even if SSCP PU and SSCP LU control sessions are interrupted.
ANS   stop means that LU LU sessions will be interrupted when the SSCP PU and SSCP LU sessions are interrupted."

Security Considerations In most cases, MIBs are not themselves security risks; if SNMP security is operating as intended, the use of a MIB to view information about a system, or to change some parameter at the system, is a tool, not a threat.
None of the read only objects in the DLUR MIB reports a password, user data, or anything else that is particularly sensitive.
Some enterprises view their network configuration itself, as well as information about network usage and performance, as corporate assets; such enterprises may wish to restrict SNMP access to most of the objects in the MIB.
There are no read write objects in the DLUR MIB.
