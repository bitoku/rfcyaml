- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   The IMAP4 specification allows the searching of only the\
    \ selected\n   mailbox.  A user often wants to search multiple mailboxes, and\
    \ a\n   client that wishes to support this must issue a series of SELECT and\n\
    \   SEARCH commands, waiting for each to complete before moving on to the\n  \
    \ next.  The commands can't be pipelined, because the server might run\n   them\
    \ in parallel, and the untagged SEARCH responses could not then be\n   distinguished\
    \ from each other.\n   This extension allows a client to search multiple mailboxes\
    \ with one\n   command, and includes MAILBOX and TAG fields in the ESEARCH response,\n\
    \   yielding the following advantages:\n   o  A single command limits the number\
    \ of round trips needed to search\n      a set of mailboxes.\n   o  A single command\
    \ eliminates the need to wait for one search to\n      complete before starting\
    \ the next.\n   o  A single command allows the server to optimize the search,\
    \ if it\n      can.\n   o  A command that is not dependent upon the selected mailbox\n\
    \      eliminates the need to disrupt the selection state or to open\n      another\
    \ IMAP connection.\n   o  The MAILBOX, UIDVALIDITY, and TAG fields in the responses\
    \ allow a\n      client to distinguish which responses go with which search (and\n\
    \      which mailbox).  A client can safely pipeline these search\n      commands\
    \ without danger of confusion.  The addition of the MAILBOX\n      and UIDVALIDITY\
    \ fields updates the search-correlator item defined\n      in [RFC4466].\n"

- title: 2.  New ESEARCH Command
  contents:
  - "2.  New ESEARCH Command\n   Arguments:  OPTIONAL source options\n           \
    \    OPTIONAL result options\n               OPTIONAL charset specification (see\
    \ [RFC2978])\n               searching criteria (one or more)\n   Responses: \
    \ REQUIRED untagged response: ESEARCH\n   Result:     OK -- search completed\n\
    \               NO -- error: cannot search that charset or criteria\n        \
    \       BAD -- command unknown or arguments invalid\n   This section defines a\
    \ new ESEARCH command, which works similarly to\n   the UID SEARCH command described\
    \ in Section 2.6.1 of [RFC4466]\n   (initially described in Section 6.4.4 of [RFC3501]\
    \ and extended by\n   [RFC4731]).\n   The ESEARCH command further extends searching\
    \ by allowing for\n   optional source and result options.  This document does\
    \ not define\n   any new result options (see Section 3.1 of [RFC4731]).  A server\
    \ that\n   supports this extension includes \"MULTISEARCH\" in its IMAP capability\n\
    \   string.\n   Because there has been confusion about this, it is worth pointing\
    \ out\n   that with ESEARCH, as with *any* SEARCH or UID SEARCH command, it\n\
    \   MUST NOT be considered an error if the search terms include a range\n   of\
    \ message numbers that extends (or, in fact, starts) beyond the end\n   of the\
    \ mailbox.  For example, a client might want to establish a\n   rolling window\
    \ through the search results this way:\n   C: tag1 UID ESEARCH FROM \"frobozz\"\
    \ 1:100\n   ...followed later by this:\n   C: tag1 UID ESEARCH FROM \"frobozz\"\
    \ 101:200\n   ...and so on.  This tells the server to match only the first hundred\n\
    \   messages in the mailbox the first time, the second hundred the second\n  \
    \ time, etc.  In fact, it might likely allow the server to optimize the\n   search\
    \ significantly.  In the above example, whether the mailbox\n   contains 50 or\
    \ 150 or 250 messages, neither of the search commands\n   shown will result in\
    \ an error.  It is up to the client to know when\n   to stop moving its search\
    \ window.\n"
- title: 2.1.  The ESEARCH Response
  contents:
  - "2.1.  The ESEARCH Response\n   In response to an ESEARCH command, the server\
    \ MUST return ESEARCH\n   responses [RFC4731] (that is, not SEARCH responses).\
    \  Because message\n   numbers are not useful for mailboxes that are not selected,\
    \ the\n   responses MUST contain information about UIDs, not message numbers.\n\
    \   This is true even if the source options specify that only the\n   selected\
    \ mailbox be searched.\n   Presence of a source option in the absence of a result\
    \ option implies\n   the \"ALL\" result option (see Section 3.1 of [RFC4731]).\
    \  Note that\n   this is not the same as the result from the SEARCH command described\n\
    \   in the IMAP base protocol [RFC3501].\n   Source options describe which mailboxes\
    \ must be searched for\n   messages.  An ESEARCH command with source options does\
    \ not affect\n   which mailbox, if any, is currently selected, regardless of which\n\
    \   mailboxes are searched.\n   For each mailbox satisfying the source options,\
    \ a single ESEARCH\n   response MUST be returned if any messages in that mailbox\
    \ match the\n   search criteria.  An ESEARCH response MUST NOT be returned for\n\
    \   mailboxes that contain no matching messages.  This is true even when\n   result\
    \ options such as MIN, MAX, and COUNT are specified (see\n   Section 3.1 of [RFC4731]),\
    \ and the values returned (lowest UID\n   matched, highest UID matched, and number\
    \ of messages matched,\n   respectively) apply to the mailbox reported in that\
    \ ESEARCH response.\n   Note that it is possible for an ESEARCH command to return\
    \ *no*\n   untagged responses (no ESEARCH responses at all), in the case that\n\
    \   there are no matches to the search in any of the mailboxes that\n   satisfy\
    \ the source options.  Clients can detect this situation by\n   finding the tagged\
    \ OK response without having received any matching\n   untagged ESEARCH responses.\n\
    \   Each ESEARCH response MUST contain the MAILBOX, TAG, and UIDVALIDITY\n   correlators.\
    \  Correlators allow clients to issue several ESEARCH\n   commands at once (pipelined).\
    \  If the SEARCHRES [RFC5182] extension\n   is used in an ESEARCH command, that\
    \ ESEARCH command MUST be executed\n   by the server after all previous SEARCH/ESEARCH\
    \ commands have\n   completed and before any subsequent SEARCH/ESEARCH commands\
    \ are\n   executed.  The server MAY perform consecutive ESEARCH commands in\n\
    \   parallel as long as none of them use the SEARCHRES extension.\n"
- title: '2.2.  Source Options: Specifying Mailboxes to Search'
  contents:
  - "2.2.  Source Options: Specifying Mailboxes to Search\n   The source options,\
    \ if present, MUST contain a mailbox specifier as\n   defined in the IMAP NOTIFY\
    \ extension [RFC5465], Section 6 (using the\n   \"filter-mailboxes\" ABNF item),\
    \ with the following differences:\n   1.  The \"selected-delayed\" specifier is\
    \ not valid here.\n   2.  A \"subtree-one\" specifier is added.  The \"subtree\"\
    \ specifier\n       results in a search of the specified mailbox and all selectable\n\
    \       mailboxes that are subordinate to it, through an indefinitely\n      \
    \ deep hierarchy.  The \"subtree-one\" specifier results in a search\n       of\
    \ the specified mailbox and all selectable child mailboxes, one\n       hierarchy\
    \ level down.\n   If \"subtree\" is specified, the server MUST defend against\
    \ loops in\n   the hierarchy (for example, those caused by recursive file-system\n\
    \   links within the message store).  The server SHOULD do this by\n   keeping\
    \ track of the mailboxes that have been searched, and\n   terminating the hierarchy\
    \ traversal when a repeat is found.  If it\n   cannot do that, it MAY do it by\
    \ limiting the hierarchy depth.\n   If the source options are not present, the\
    \ value \"selected\" is\n   assumed -- that is, only the currently selected mailbox\
    \ is searched.\n   The \"personal\" source option is a particularly convenient\
    \ way to\n   search all of the current user's mailboxes.  Note that there is no\n\
    \   way to use wildcard characters to search all mailboxes; the\n   \"mailboxes\"\
    \ source option does not do wildcard expansion.\n   If the source options include\
    \ (or default to) \"selected\", the IMAP\n   session MUST be in \"selected\" state.\
    \  If the source options specify\n   other mailboxes and NOT \"selected\", then\
    \ the IMAP session MUST be in\n   either \"selected\" or \"authenticated\" state.\
    \  If the session is not in\n   a correct state, the ESEARCH command MUST return\
    \ a \"BAD\" result.\n   If the server supports the SEARCHRES [RFC5182] extension,\
    \ then the\n   \"SAVE\" result option is valid *only* if \"selected\" is specified\
    \ or\n   defaulted as the sole mailbox to be searched.  If any source option\n\
    \   other than \"selected\" is specified, the ESEARCH command MUST return a\n\
    \   \"BAD\" result.\n   If the server supports the CONTEXT=SEARCH and/or CONTEXT=SORT\n\
    \   extension [RFC5267], then the following additional rules apply:\n   o  The\
    \ CONTEXT return option (Section 4.2 of [RFC5267]) can be used\n      with an\
    \ ESEARCH command.\n   o  If the UPDATE return option is used (Section 4.3 of\
    \ [RFC5267]), it\n      MUST apply ONLY to the currently selected mailbox.  If\
    \ UPDATE is\n      used and there is no mailbox currently selected, the ESEARCH\n\
    \      command MUST return a \"BAD\" result.\n   o  The PARTIAL search return\
    \ option (Section 4.4 of [RFC5267]) can be\n      used and applies to each mailbox\
    \ searched by the ESEARCH command.\n   If the server supports the Access Control\
    \ List (ACL) [RFC4314]\n   extension, then the logged-in user is required to have\
    \ the \"r\" right\n   for each mailbox she wants to search.  In addition, any\
    \ mailboxes\n   that are not explicitly named (accessed through \"personal\" or\n\
    \   \"subtree\", for example) are required to have the \"l\" right.\n   Mailboxes\
    \ matching the source options for which the logged-in user\n   lacks sufficient\
    \ rights MUST be ignored by the ESEARCH command\n   processing.  In particular,\
    \ ESEARCH responses MUST NOT be returned\n   for those mailboxes.\n"

- title: 5.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "5.  Security Considerations\n   This new IMAP ESEARCH command allows a single\
    \ command to search many\n   mailboxes at once.  On the one hand, a client could\
    \ do that by\n   sending many IMAP SEARCH commands.  On the other hand, this makes\
    \ it\n   easier for a client to overwork a server, by sending a single command\n\
    \   that results in an expensive search of tens of thousands of\n   mailboxes.\
    \  Server implementations need to be aware of that, and\n   provide mechanisms\
    \ that prevent a client from adversely affecting\n   other users.  Limitations\
    \ on the number of mailboxes that may be\n   searched in one command, and/or on\
    \ the server resources that will be\n   devoted to responding to a single client,\
    \ are reasonable limitations\n   for an implementation to impose.\n   Implementations\
    \ MUST, of course, apply access controls appropriately,\n   limiting a user's\
    \ access to ESEARCH in the same way its access is\n   limited for any other IMAP\
    \ commands.  This extension has no data-\n   access risks beyond what may be there\
    \ in the unextended IMAP\n   implementation.\n   Mailboxes matching the source\
    \ options for which the logged-in user\n   lacks sufficient rights MUST be ignored\
    \ by the ESEARCH command\n   processing (see the paragraph about this in Section\
    \ 2.2).  In\n   particular, any attempt to distinguish insufficient access from\n\
    \   non-existent mailboxes may expose information about the mailbox\n   hierarchy\
    \ that isn't otherwise available to the client.\n   If \"subtree\" is specified,\
    \ the server MUST defend against loops in\n   the hierarchy (see the paragraph\
    \ about this in Section 2.2).\n"
