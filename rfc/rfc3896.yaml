  contents:
  - "2.2.1.  Usage of ifStackTable\n   The object dsx3IfIndex has been deprecated.\
    \  This object previously\n   allowed a very special proxy situation to exist\
    \ for Routers and CSUs.\n   This section now describes how to use ifStackTable\
    \ to represent this\n   relationship.\n   The paragraphs discussing dsx3IfIndex\
    \ and dsx3LineIndex have been\n   preserved in Appendix A for informational purposes.\n\
    \   The ifStackTable is used in the proxy case to represent the\n   association\
    \ between pairs of interfaces, e.g., this DS3 is attached\n   to that DS3.  This\
    \ use is consistent with the use of the ifStackTable\n   to show the association\
    \ between various sub-layers of an interface.\n   In both cases entire PDUs are\
    \ exchanged between the interface pairs -\n   in the case of a DS3, entire DS3\
    \ frames are exchanged; in the case of\n   PPP and HDLC, entire HDLC frames are\
    \ exchanged.  This usage is not\n   meant to suggest the use of the ifStackTable\
    \ to represent Time\n   Division Multiplexing (TDM) connections in general.\n\
    \   External&Internal interface scenario: the SNMP Agent resides on a\n   host\
    \ external from the device supporting DS3/E3 interfaces (e.g., a\n   router).\
    \  The Agent represents both the host and the DS3/E3 device.\n   Example:\n  \
    \ A shelf full of CSUs connected to a Router.  An SNMP Agent residing\n   on the\
    \ router proxies for itself and the CSU.  The router has also an\n   Ethernet\

    \ related to loopbacks.\n   The object dsx3LoopbackConfig represents the desired\
    \ state of\n   loopbacks on this interface.  Using this object a Manager can\n\
    \   request:\n       LineLoopback\n       PayloadLoopback (if ESF framing)\n \
    \      InwardLoopback\n       DualLoopback (Line + Inward)\n       NoLoopback\n\
    \   The remote end can also request lookbacks either through the FDL\n   channel\
    \ if ESF or inband if D4.  The loopbacks that can be requested\n   this way are:\n\
    \       LineLoopback\n       PayloadLoopback (if ESF framing)\n       NoLoopback\n\
    \   To model the current state of loopbacks on a DS3 interface, the\n   object\
    \ dsx3LoopbackStatus defines which loopback is currently applied\n   to an interface.\
    \  This object, which is a bitmap, will have bits\n   turned on which reflect\
    \ the currently active loopbacks on the\n   interface as well as the source of\
    \ those loopbacks.\n   The following restrictions/rules apply to loopbacks:\n\
    \   The far end cannot undo loopbacks set by a manager.\n   A manager can undo\
    \ loopbacks set by the far end.\n   Both a line loopback and an inward loopback\
    \ can be set at the same\n   time.  Only these two loopbacks can co-exist and\
    \ either one may be\n   set by the manager or the far end.  A LineLoopback request\
    \ from the\n   far end is incremental to an existing Inward loopback established\
    \ by\n   a manager.  When a NoLoopback is received from the far end in this\n\
    \   case, the InwardLoopback remains in place.\n"

    \ of a pulse of the same polarity as the\n         previous pulse without being\
    \ part of the zero substitution\n         code, B3ZS(HDB3).  For B3ZS(HDB3)-coded\

    \ patterns\n         such as:  three(four) or more consecutive zeros and incorrect\n\
    \         polarity (See T1.231 section 7.1.1.1.1).\n   Excessive Zeros (EXZ) Error\
    \ Event\n         An EXZ is the occurrence of any zero string length equal to\

    \     unavailable seconds.  (Also known as SAS-P.  See T1.231\n           section\
    \ 7.4.2.6.)\n   Unavailable Seconds (UAS)\n           UAS are calculated by counting\
    \ the number of seconds that the\n           interface is unavailable.  The DS3\
    \ interface is said to be\n           unavailable from the onset of 10 contiguous\
    \ PSESs, or the\n           onset of the condition leading to a failure (see Failure\n\
    \           States).  If the condition leading to the failure was\n          \
    \ immediately preceded by one or more contiguous PSESs, then\n           the DS3\
    \ interface unavailability starts from the onset of\n           these PSESs. \
    \ Once unavailable, and if no failure is present,\n           the DS3 interface\
    \ becomes available at the onset of 10\n           contiguous seconds with no\
    \ PSESs.  Once unavailable, and if a\n           failure is present, the DS3 interface\
    \ becomes available at\n           the onset of 10 contiguous seconds with no\
    \ PSESs, if the\n           failure clearing time is less than or equal to 10\
    \ seconds.\n           If the failure clearing time is more than 10 seconds, the\
    \ DS3\n           interface becomes available at the onset of 10 contiguous\n\
    \           seconds with no PSESs, or the onset period leading to the\n      \
    \     successful clearing condition, whichever occurs later.  With\n         \
    \  respect to the DS3 error counts, all counters are incremented\n           while\
    \ the DS3 interface is deemed available.  While the\n           interface is deemed\
    \ unavailable, the only count that is\n           incremented is UASs.\n     \
    \      Note that this definition implies that the agent cannot\n           determine\
    \ until after a ten second interval has passed\n           whether a given one-second\
    \ interval belongs to available or\n           unavailable time.  If the agent\
    \ chooses to update the various\n           performance statistics in real time\
    \ then it must be prepared\n           to retroactively reduce the PES, PSES,\
    \ CES, and CSES counts\n           by 10 and increase the UAS count by 10 when\
    \ it determines\n           that available time has been entered.  It must also\
    \ be\n           prepared to adjust the PCV, CCV, and SEFS count as necessary\n\
    \           since these parameters are not accumulated during unavailable\n  \
    \         time.  Similarly, it must be prepared to retroactively\n           decrease\
    \ the UAS count by 10 and increase the PES, CES, PCV,\n           and CCV counts\
    \ as necessary upon entering available time.  A\n           special case exists\
    \ when the 10 second period leading to\n           available or unavailable time\
    \ crosses a 900 second statistics\n           window boundary, as the foregoing\
    \ description implies that\n           the PCV, CCV, PES, CES, PSES, CSEC, SEFS,\
    \ and UAS counts for\n           the PREVIOUS interval must be adjusted.  In this\
    \ case\n           successive GETs of the affected dsx3IntervalPSESs and\n   \
    \        dsx3IntervalUASs objects will return differing values if the\n      \
    \     first GET occurs during the first few seconds of the window.\n         \
    \  The agent may instead choose to delay updates to the various\n           statistics\
    \ by 10 seconds in order to avoid retroactive\n           adjustments to the counters.\
    \  A way to do this is sketched in\n           Appendix B.\n   In any case, a\
    \ linkDown trap shall be sent only after the agent has\n   determined for certain\
    \ that the unavailable state has been entered,\n   but the time on the trap will\
    \ be that of the first UAS (i.e., 10\n   seconds earlier).  A linkUp trap shall\
    \ be handled similarly.\n   According to [ANSI-T1.231] unavailable time begins\
    \ at the _onset_ of\n   10 contiguous severely errored seconds -- that is, unavailable\
    \ time\n   starts with the _first_ of the 10 contiguous SESs.  Also, while an\n\
    \   interface is deemed unavailable all counters for that interface are\n   frozen\
    \ except for the UAS count.  It follows that an implementation\n   which strictly\
    \ complies with this standard must _not_ increment any\n   counters other than\
    \ the UAS count -- even temporarily -- as a result\n   of anything that happens\
    \ during those 10 seconds.  Since changes in\n   the signal state lag the data\
    \ to which they apply by 10 seconds, an\n   ANSI-compliant implementation must\
    \ pass the one-second statistics\n   through a 10-second delay line prior to updating\
    \ any counters.  That\n   can be done by performing the following steps at the\
    \ end of each one\n   second interval.\n      i)   Read near/far end CV counter\
    \ and alarm status flags from the\n           hardware.\n      ii)  Accumulate\
    \ the CV counts for the preceding second and compare\n           them to the ES\
    \ and SES threshold for the layer in question.\n           Update the signal state\
    \ and shift the one-second CV counts\n           and ES/SES flags into the 10-element\
    \ delay line.  Note that\n           far-end one-second statistics are to be flagged\
    \ as \"absent\"\n           during any second in which there is an incoming defect\
    \ at the\n           layer in question or at any lower layer.\n      iii) Update\
    \ the current interval statistics using the signal state\n           from the\
    \ _previous_ update cycle and the one-second CV counts\n           and ES/SES\
    \ flags shifted out of the 10-element delay line.\n   This approach is further\
    \ described in Appendix B.\n"

    \ specified by the circuit vendor,\n           and is useful when communicating\
    \ with the vendor during the\n           troubleshooting process (see M.1400 [ITU-T-M.1400]\

    \ the word proxy is meant to indicate an\n           application which receives\
    \ SNMP messages and replies to them\n           on behalf of the devices which\
    \ implement the actual DS3/E3\n           interfaces.  The proxy may have already\
    \ collected the\n           information about the DS3/E3 interfaces into its local\n\
    \           database and may not necessarily forward the requests to the\n   \
    \        actual DS3/E3 interface.  It is expected in such an\n           application\
    \ that there are periods of time where the proxy is\n           not communicating\
    \ with the DS3/E3 interfaces.  In these\n           instances the proxy will not\
    \ necessarily have up-to-date\n           configuration information and will most\
    \ likely have missed\n           the collection of some statistics data.  Missed\
    \ statistics\n           data collection will result in invalid data in the interval\n\

  contents:
  - "4.  Appendix A - Use of dsx3IfIndex and dsx3LineIndex\n   This Appendix exists\
    \ to document the previous use if dsx3IfIndex and\n   dsx3LineIndex and to clarify\
    \ the relationship of dsx3LineIndex as\n   defined in RFC 1407 with the dsx3LineIndex\
    \ as defined in this\n   document.\n   The following shows the old and new definitions\
    \ and the relationship:\n   [New Definition]: \"This object should be made equal\
    \ to ifIndex.  The\n   next paragraph describes its previous usage.  Making the\
    \ object equal\n   to ifIndex allows proper use of ifStackTable.\n   [Old Definition]:\
    \ \"this object is the identifier of a DS3/E3\n   Interface on a managed device.\
    \  If there is an ifEntry that is\n   directly associated with this and only this\
    \ DS3/E3 interface, it\n   should have the same value as ifIndex.  Otherwise,\
    \ number the\n   dsx3LineIndices with an unique identifier following the rules\
    \ of\n   choosing a number that is greater than ifNumber and numbering the\n \
    \  inside interfaces (e.g., equipment side) with even numbers and\n   outside\
    \ interfaces (e.g, network side) with odd numbers.\"\n   When the \"Old Definition\"\
    \ was created, it was described this way to\n   allow a manager to treat the value\
    \ _as if_ it were an ifIndex, i.e.,\n   the value would either be:  1) an ifIndex\
    \ value or 2) a value that\n   was guaranteed to be different from all valid ifIndex\
    \ values.\n   The new definition is a subset of that definition, i.e., the value\
    \ is\n   always an ifIndex value.\n   The following is Section 3.1 from [RFC1407]:\n\
    \   Different physical configurations for the support of SNMP with DS3/E3\n  \
    \ equipment exist.  To accommodate these scenarios, two different\n   indices\
    \ for DS3/E3 interfaces are introduced in this MIB.  These\n   indices are dsx3IfIndex\
    \ and dsx3LineIndex.\n   External interface scenario: the SNMP Agent represents\
    \ all managed\n   DS3/E3 lines as external interfaces (for example, an Agent residing\n\
    \   on the device supporting DS3/E3 interfaces directly):\n   For this scenario,\
    \ all interfaces are assigned an integer value equal\n   to ifIndex, and the following\
    \ applies:\n      ifIndex=dsx3IfIndex=dsx3LineIndex for all interfaces.\n   The\
    \ dsx3IfIndex column of the DS3/E3 Configuration table relates each\n   DS3/E3\
    \ interface to its corresponding interface (ifIndex) in the\n   Internet-standard\
    \ MIB (MIB-II STD 17, [RFC1213]).\n   External&Internal interface scenario: the\
    \ SNMP Agents resides on an\n   host external from the device supporting DS3/E3\
    \ interfaces (e.g., a\n   router).  The Agent represents both the host and the\
    \ DS3/E3 device.\n   The index dsx3LineIndex is used to not only represent the\

  - "5.  Appendix B - The delay approach to Unavialable Seconds.\n   This procedure\
    \ is illustrated below for a DS3 C-Bit parity\n   application.  Similar rules\
    \ would apply for other interfaces covered\n   by this MIB.  The procedure guarantees\

    \ the current interval\n   counts are transferred to the most recent interval\

    \   discarded if necessary in order to make room.  The current interval\n   counts\
    \ then start over from zero.  Note, however, that the signal\n   state calculation\

- title: 8.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "8.  Security Considerations\n   There are a number of management objects defined\
    \ in this MIB module\n   with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write.  Such objects\
    \ may be\n   considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.\
    \  The\n   support for SET operations in a non-secure environment without proper\n\
    \   protection can have a negative effect on network operations.  The\n   specific\
    \ the objects and their sensitivities/vulnerabilities are as\n   follows.\n  \
    \ Setting the following objects to incorrect values may result in\n   traffic\
    \ interruptions:\n      dsx3LineType\n      dsx3LineCoding\n      dsx3SendCode\n\
    \      dsx3LoopbackConfig\n      dsx3TransmitClockSource\n      dsx3LineLength\n\
    \      dsx3Channelization\n      dsx3Ds1ForRemoteLoop\n   In the case of dsx3LineType,\
    \ for example, both ends of a DS3/E3 must\n   have the same value in order for\
    \ traffic to flow.  In the case of\n   dsx3SendCode and dsx3LoopbackConfig, for\
    \ another example, traffic may\n   stop transmitting when particular loopbacks\
    \ are applied.\n   Setting the following objects to an incorrect value will result\
    \ in\n   the remote end receiving an incorrect Path Identification message,\n\
    \   which may result in a connectivity inconsistency:\n      dsx3FarEndEquipCode\n\
    \      dsx3FarEndLocationIDCode\n      dsx3FarEndFrameIDCode\n      dsx3FarEndUnitCode\n\
    \      dsx3FarEndFacilityIDCode\n   Setting the following object to an incorrect\
    \ value will not harm the\n   traffic, but it may cause a circuit to be mis-identified\
    \ and thereby\n   create difficulties for service personnel when attempting to\n\
    \   troubleshoot a problem:\n      dsx3CircuitIdentifier\n   Setting the following\
    \ object can cause an increase in the number of\n   traps received by the network\
    \ management station:\n      dsx3LineStatusChangeTrapEnable\n   The readable objects\
    \ in this MIB module (i.e., the objects with a\n   MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible)\
    \ may be considered sensitive in\n   some environments since, collectively, they\
    \ provide extensive\n   information about the performance of interfaces in DS3/E3\
    \ equipment\n   or networks and can reveal some aspects of their configuration.\
    \  In\n   such environments it is important to control even GET and NOTIFY\n \
    \  access to these objects and possibly to encrypt the values of these\n   objects\
    \ when sending them over the network via SNMP.\n   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3\
    \ did not include adequate security.\n   Even if the network itself is secure\
    \ (for example by using IPSec),\n   even then, there is no control as to who on\
    \ the secure network is\n   allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete)\
    \ the objects\n   in this MIB module.\n   It is RECOMMENDED that implementers\
    \ consider the security features as\n   provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see\
    \ [RFC3410], section 8),\n   including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic\
    \ mechanisms (for\n   authentication and privacy).\n   Further, deployment of\
    \ SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT\n   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED\
    \ to deploy SNMPv3 and to\n   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator\n\
    \   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an\n   instance\
    \ of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to\n   the objects\
    \ only to those principals (users) that have legitimate\n   rights to indeed GET\
    \ or SET (change/create/delete) them.\n"
