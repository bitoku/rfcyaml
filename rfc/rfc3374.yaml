  - "1.0 Introduction\n   In networks where the hosts are mobile, the routing path\
    \ through the\n   network must often be changed in order to deliver the host's\
    \ IP\n   traffic to the new point of access.  Changing the basic routing path\n\
    \   is the job of a IP mobility protocol, such as Mobile IPv4 [1] and\n   Mobile\
    \ IPv6 [2].  But the success of real time services such as VoIP\n   telephony,\
    \ video, etc., in a mobile environment depends heavily upon\n   the minimization\
    \ of the impact of this traffic redirection.  In the\n   process of establishing\
    \ the new routing path, the nodes along the new\n   path must be prepared to provide\
    \ similar routing treatment to the IP\n   packets as was provided along the old\
    \ routing path.\n   In many cases, the routing treatment of IP packets within\
    \ a network\n   may be regulated by a collection of context transfer-candidate\n\
    \   services that influence how packets for the host are treated.  For\n   example,\
    \ whether a particular host has the right to obtain any\n   routing at all out\
    \ of the local subnet may depend on whether the host\n   negotiated a successful\
    \ AAA exchange with a network access server at\n   some point in the past.  Establishing\
    \ these services initially\n   results in a certain amount of related state within\
    \ the network and\n   requires a perhaps considerable amount of time for the protocol\n\
    \   exchanges.  If the host is required to re-establish those services by\n  \
    \ the same process as it uses to initially establish them, delay-\n   sensitive\
    \ real time traffic may be seriously impacted.\n   An alternative is to transfer\
    \ enough information on the context\n   transfer-candidate service state, or context,\
    \ to the new subnet so\n   that the services can be re-established quickly, rather\
    \ than require\n   the mobile host to establish them from scratch.  The transfer\
    \ of\n   service context may be advantageous in minimizing the impact of host\n\
    \   mobility on, for example, AAA, header compression, QoS, policy, and\n   possibly\
    \ sub-IP protocols and services such as PPP.  Context transfer\n   at a minimum\
    \ can be used to replicate the configuration information\n   needed to establish\
    \ the respective protocols and services.  In\n   addition, it may also provide\
    \ the capability to replicate state\n   information, allowing stateful protocols\
    \ and services at the new node\n   to be activated along the new path with less\
    \ delay and less signaling\n   overhead.\n   In this document, a case is made\
    \ for why the Seamoby Working Group\n   should investigate context transfer.\n"

  contents:
  - "3.0 Scope of the Context Transfer Problem\n   The context transfer problem examined\
    \ in this document is restricted\n   to re-establishing services for a mobile\
    \ host that are, in some\n   sense, related to the forwarding treatment of the\
    \ mobile host's\n   packets or network access for the mobile host.  It is not\
    \ concerned\n   with actually re-establishing routing information.  Routing changes\n\
    \   due to mobility are the domain of the IP mobility protocol.  In\n   addition,\
    \ transfer of context related to application-level services,\n   such as those\
    \ associated with the mobile host's HTTP proxy, is also\n   not considered in\
    \ this document, although a generic context transfer\n   protocol for transferring\
    \ the context of services related to\n   forwarding treatment or network access\
    \ may also function for\n   application-level services as well.\n   An important\
    \ consideration in whether a service is a candidate for\n   context transfer is\
    \ whether it is possible to obtain a \"correct\"\n   context transfer for the\
    \ service in a given implementation and\n   deployment, that is, one which will\
    \ result in the same context at the\n   new access router as would have resulted\
    \ had the mobile host\n   undergone a protocol exchange with the access router\
    \ from scratch.\n   For some services, the circumstances under which context transfer\
    \ may\n   result in correctness may be very limited [11].\n"
- title: 4.0 The Need for Context Transfer
  contents:
  - "4.0 The Need for Context Transfer\n   There are two basic motivations for context\
    \ transfer:\n   1) The primary motivation, as mentioned in the introduction, is\
    \ the\n      need to quickly re-establish context transfer-candidate services\n\
    \      without requiring the mobile host to explicitly perform all\n      protocol\
    \ flows for those services from scratch.\n   2) An additional motivation is to\
    \ provide an interoperable solution\n      that works for any Layer 2 radio access\
    \ technology.\n   These points are discussed in more detail in the following\n\
    \   subsections.\n"
- title: 4.1 Fast Context Transfer-candidate Service Re-establishment
  contents:
  - "4.1 Fast Context Transfer-candidate Service Re-establishment\n   As mentioned\
    \ in the introduction, there are a variety of context\n   transfer-candidate services\
    \ that could utilize a context transfer\n   solution.  In this section, three\
    \ representative services are\n   examined.  The consequences of not having a\
    \ context transfer solution\n   are examined as a means of motivating the need\
    \ for such a solution.\n"
- title: 4.1.1 Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA)
  contents:
  - "4.1.1 Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA)\n   One of the more\
    \ compelling applications of context transfer is\n   facilitating the re-authentication\
    \ of the mobile host and\n   re-establishment of the mobile host's authorization\
    \ for network\n   access in a new subnet by transferring the AAA context from\
    \ the\n   mobile host's previous AAA server to another.  This would allow the\n\
    \   mobile host to continue access in the new subnet without having to\n   redo\
    \ an AAA exchange with the new subnet's AAA server.  Naturally, a\n   security\
    \ association between the AAA servers is necessary so that the\n   mobile host's\
    \ sensitive authentication information can be securely\n   transferred.\n   In\
    \ the absence of context transfer, there are two ways that can\n   currently be\
    \ used for AAA:\n   1) Layer 2 mechanisms, such as EAP [3] in PPP [4] or 802.1x\
    \ [5] can\n      be used to redo the initial protocol exchange, or possibly to\n\
    \      update it.  Currently, there is no general Layer 3 mechanism for\n    \
    \  conducting an AAA exchange between a host and an AAA server in the\n      network.\n\
    \   2) If the mobile host is using Mobile IPv4 (but not Mobile IPv6\n      currently),\
    \ the host can use the AAA registration keys [6]\n      extension for Mobile IPv4\
    \ to establish a security association with\n      the new Foreign Agent.\n   Since\
    \ 2) is piggybacked on the Mobile IPv4 signaling, the performance\n   is less\
    \ likely to be an issue, but 2) is not a general solution.  The\n   performance\
    \ of 1) is likely to be considerably less than is necessary\n   for maintaining\
    \ good real time stream performance.\n"
- title: 4.1.2 Header Compression
  contents:
  - "4.1.2 Header Compression\n   In [7], protocols are described for efficient compression\
    \ of IP\n   headers to avoid sending large headers over low bandwidth radio\n\
    \   network links.  Establishing header compression generally requires\n   from\
    \ 1 to 4 exchanges between the last hop router and the mobile host\n   with full\
    \ or partially compressed headers before full compression is\n   available.  During\
    \ this period, the mobile host will experience an\n   effective reduction in the\
    \ application-available bandwidth equivalent\n   to the uncompressed header information\
    \ sent over the air.  Limiting\n   the uncompressed traffic required to establish\
    \ full header\n   compression on a new last hop router facilitates maintaining\
    \ adequate\n   application-available bandwidth for real time streams, especially\
    \ for\n   IPv6 where the headers are larger.\n   Context transfer can help in\
    \ this case by allowing the network entity\n   performing header compression,\
    \ usually the last hop router, to\n   transfer the header compression context\
    \ to the new router.  The\n   timing of context transfer must be arranged so that\
    \ the header\n   context is transferred from the old router as soon as the mobile\
    \ host\n   is no longer receiving packets through the old router, and installed\n\
    \   on the new router before any packets are delivered to or forwarded\n   from\
    \ the mobile host.\n"
- title: 4.1.3 Quality of Service (QoS)
  contents:
  - "4.1.3 Quality of Service (QoS)\n   Significant QoS protocol exchanges between\
    \ the mobile host and\n   routers in the network may be required in order to establish\
    \ the\n   initial QoS treatment for a mobile host's packets.  The exact\n   mechanism\
    \ whereby QoS for a mobile host should be established is\n   currently an active\
    \ topic of investigation in the IETF.  For existing\n   QoS approaches (Diffsrv\
    \ and Intsrv) preliminary studies have\n   indicated that the protocol flows necessary\
    \ to re-establish QoS in a\n   new subnet from scratch can be very time consuming\
    \ for Mobile IP, and\n   other mobility protocols may suffer as well.\n   A method\
    \ of transferring the mobile host's QoS context from the old\n   network to the\
    \ new could facilitate faster re-establishment of the\n   mobile host's QoS treatment\
    \ on the new subnet.  However, for QoS\n   mechanisms that are end-to-end, transferring\
    \ context at the last hop\n   router may be insufficient to completely re-initialize\
    \ the mobile\n   host's QoS treatment, since some number of additional routers\
    \ in the\n   path between the mobile host and corresponding node may also need\
    \ to\n   be involved.\n"
- title: 4.2 Interoperability
  contents:
  - "4.2 Interoperability\n   A particular concern for seamless handover is that different\
    \ Layer 2\n   radio protocols may define their own solutions for context transfer.\n\
    \   There are ongoing efforts within 3GPP [8] and IEEE [9] to define such\n  \
    \ solutions.  These solutions are primarily designed to facilitate the\n   transfer\
    \ of Layer 2-related context over a wired IP network between\n   two radio access\
    \ networks or two radio access points.  However, the\n   designs can include extensibility\
    \ features that would allow Layer 3\n   context to be transferred.  Such is the\
    \ case with [10], for example.\n   If Layer 2 protocols were to be widely adopted\
    \ as an optimization\n   measure for Layer 3 context transfer, seamless mobility\
    \ of a mobile\n   host having Layer 2 network interfaces that support multiple\
    \ radio\n   protocols would be difficult to achieve.  Essentially, a gateway or\n\
    \   translator between Layer 2 protocols would be required, or the mobile\n  \
    \ host would be required to perform a full re-initialization of its\n   context\
    \ transfer-candidate services on the new radio network, if no\n   translator were\
    \ available, in order to hand over a mobile host\n   between two access technologies.\n\
    \   A general Layer 3 context transfer solution may also be useful for\n   Layer\
    \ 2 protocols that do not define their own context transfer\n   protocol.  Consideration\
    \ of this issue is outside the scope of the\n   Seamoby Working Group, however,\
    \ since it depends on the details of\n   the particular Layer 2 protocol.\n"

    \ best solution for\n   re-establishing context transfer-candidate services on\
    \ a new subnet.\n   There are certain limitations on when context transfer may\
    \ be\n   useful. These limitations are discussed in the following subsections.\n"
- title: 5.1 Router Compatibility
  contents:
  - "5.1 Router Compatibility\n   Context transfer between two routers is possible\
    \ only if the\n   receiving router supports the same context transfer-candidate\n\
    \   services as the sending router.  This does not mean that the two\n   nodes\
    \ are identical in their implementation, nor does it even imply\n   that they\
    \ must have identical capabilities.  A router that cannot\n   make use of received\
    \ context should refuse the transfer.  This\n   results in a situation no different\
    \ than a mobile host handover\n   without context transfer, and should not be\
    \ considered an error or\n   failure situation.\n"

    \ is of no benefit.\n"
- title: 7.0 Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "7.0 Security Considerations\n   Any context transfer standard must provide mechanism\
    \ for adequately\n   securely the context transfer process, and a recommendation\
    \ to deploy\n   security, as is typically the case for Internet standards.  Some\n\
    \   general considerations for context transfer security include:\n   - Information\
    \ privacy: the context may contain information which the\n     end user or network\
    \ operator would prefer to keep hidden from\n     unauthorized viewers.\n   -\
    \ Transfer legitimacy: a false or purposely corrupted context\n     transfer could\
    \ have a severe impact upon the operation of the\n     receiving router, and therefore\
    \ could potentially affect the\n     operation of the access network itself. \
    \ The potential threats\n     include denial of service and theft of service attacks.\n\
    \    - Security preservation: part of the context transfer may include\n     information\
    \ pertinent to a security association established between\n     the mobile host\
    \ and another entity on the network.  For this\n     security association to be\
    \ preserved during handover, the transfer\n     of the security context must include\
    \ the appropriate security\n     measures.\n   It is expected that the measures\
    \ used to secure the transport of\n   information between peers (e.g., IPSEC [10])\
    \ in an IP network should\n   be sufficient for context transfer.  However, given\
    \ the above\n   considerations, there may be reason to provide for additional\n\
    \   security measures beyond the available IETF solutions.\n   Since context transfer\
    \ requires a trust relationship between network\n   entities, the compromise of\
    \ only one of the network entities that\n   transfer context may be sufficient\
    \ to reduce the security of the\n   whole system, if for example the context transferred\
    \ includes\n   encryption keying material.  When the host moves from the compromised\n\
    \   network entity to an uncompromised network entity in the presence of\n   context\
    \ transfer, the compromised context may be used to decrypt the\n   communication\
    \ channel.  When context transfer is not used, a\n   compromise of only one network\
    \ entity only gives access to what that\n   network entity can see.  When the\
    \ mobile host moves to an\n   uncompromised network entity in the absence of context\
    \ transfer,\n   security can be re-established at the new entity.  However, to\
    \ the\n   extent that context transfer happens primarily between routers, the\n\
    \   security of context transfer will depend on the security of the\n   routers.\
    \  Any compromise of security on a router that affects context\n   transfer may\
    \ also lead to other, equally serious disruptions in\n   network traffic.\n  \
    \ The context transfer investigation must identify any novel security\n   measures\
    \ required for context transfer that exceed the capabilities\n   of the existing\
    \ or emerging IETF solutions.\n"
