Abstract This document updates RFC 3978 "IETF Rights in Contributions" to recognize that the IETF Trust is now the proper custodian of all IETF related intellectual property rights.
This document does not constrain how the IETF Trust exercises those rights.
Currently the IETF requires that authors of Contributions to the IETF grant to the IETF (meaning the full set of participants in the IETF Standards Process) a limited set of non exclusive rights and permissions as part of the process of submitting such Contribution.
These rights and permissions are detailed in "IETF Rights in Contributions" (RFC 3978 BCP 78)
The IETF Trust was recently formed to act as the administrative custodian of all copyrights and other intellectual property rights relating to the IETF Standards Process that had previously been held by ISOC and the Corporation for National Research Initiatives (CNRI)
The IETF is supported by an IETF Administrative Support Activity (IASA) defined in BCP 101 [BCP101].
BCP 101 was updated by [RFC4371] to recognize the creation of the IETF Trust.
This document updates RFC 3978 in order to recognize the IETF Trust and to implement the structure needed to support it.
Most importantly, it alters the license grant path as follows:
whereas previously, authors of Contributions to the IETF would grant a license to ISOC, such authors will grant a license to the IETF Trust (in Section 3.3).
This document concerns itself only with changes to RFC 3978 needed to recognize the creation of the IETF Trust.
This introductory section is to provide context for the reader.
Section 2 of this document is intended to be normative.
The text of RFC 3978 is hereby updated as set forth below to reflect the creation of the IETF Trust.
In the third paragraph of Section 2, replace "IETF and Internet Society
(ISOC)" with "IETF Trust and the IETF" and replace "IETF and ISOC" with "IETF Trust and the IETF".
In Section 3.3, replace two instances of "ISOC and the IETF" and one instance of "IETF and ISOC" with "IETF Trust and the IETF".
In Section 3.4(b), add "IETF Trust, " after "IETF,".
In Section 4.2, replace two instances of "ISOC and the IETF" and one instance of "IETF and ISOC" with "IETF Trust and the IETF".
In Section 5 change two instances of "ISOC" to "IETF Trust".
Update Copyright Statement Replace "Internet Society" with "IETF Trust" in the copyright statement in Section 5.4. 2.7.
In Section 5.5 insert ", THE IETF TRUST" after "INTERNET SOCIETY".
In Section 5.6, replace all occurrences of "Internet Society" or "ISOC" with "IETF Trust".
In Section 7.1, replace two instances of "IETF/ISOC" with "IETF Trust and IETF". 2.10.
In Section 8, insert ", the IETF Trust" after "ISOC".
This type of process document does not have a direct impact on the security of the Internet or Internet protocols.
