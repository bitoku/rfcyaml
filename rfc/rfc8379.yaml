  - "Abstract\n   When a link is being prepared to be taken out of service, the traffic\n
    \  needs to be diverted from both ends of the link.  Increasing the\n   metric
    to the highest value on one side of the link is not sufficient\n   to divert the
    traffic flowing in the other direction.\n   It is useful for the routers in an
    OSPFv2 or OSPFv3 routing domain to\n   be able to advertise a link as being in
    a graceful-shutdown state to\n   indicate impending maintenance activity on the
    link.  This\n   information can be used by the network devices to reroute the
    traffic\n   effectively.\n   This document describes the protocol extensions to
    disseminate\n   graceful-link-shutdown information in OSPFv2 and OSPFv3.\n"

  - "1.  Introduction\n   This document describes a mechanism for gracefully taking
    a link out\n   of service while allowing it to be used if no other path is\n   available.
    \ It also provides a mechanism to divert the traffic from\n   both directions
    of the link.\n   Many OSPFv2 or OSPFv3 deployments run on overlay networks provisioned\n
    \  by means of pseudowires or L2 circuits.  Prior to devices in the\n   underlying
    network going offline for maintenance, it is useful to\n   divert the traffic
    away from the node before maintenance is actually\n   performed.  Since the nodes
    in the underlying network are not visible\n   to OSPF, the existing stub-router
    mechanism described in [RFC6987]\n   cannot be used.  In a service provider's
    network, there may be many\n   CE-to-CE connections that run over a single PE.
    \ It is cumbersome to\n   change the metric on every CE-to-CE connection in both
    directions.\n   This document provides a mechanism to change the metric of the
    link\n   on the remote side and also use the link as a last-resort link if no\n
    \  alternate paths are available.  An application specific to this use\n   case
    is described in detail in Section 7.1.\n   This document provides mechanisms to
    advertise graceful-link-shutdown\n   state in the flexible encodings provided
    by \"OSPFv2 Prefix/Link\n   Attribute Advertisement\" [RFC7684] and the E-Router-LSA
    [RFC8362] for\n   OSPFv3.  Throughout this document, OSPF is used when the text
    applies\n   to both OSPFv2 and OSPFv3.  OSPFv2 or OSPFv3 is used when the text
    is\n   specific to one version of the OSPF protocol.\n"

  - "2.  Motivation\n   The motivation of this document is to reduce manual intervention\n
    \  during maintenance activities.  The following objectives help to\n   accomplish
    this in a range of deployment scenarios.\n   1.  Advertise impending maintenance
    activity so that traffic from\n       both directions can be diverted away from
    the link.\n   2.  Allow the solution to be backward compatible so that nodes that\n
    \      do not understand the new advertisement do not cause routing\n       loops.\n
    \  3.  Advertise the maintenance activity to other nodes in the network\n       so
    that Label Switched Path (LSP) ingress routers/controllers can\n       learn about
    the impending maintenance activity and apply specific\n       policies to reroute
    the LSPs for deployments based on Traffic\n       Engineering (TE).\n   4.  Allow
    the link to be used as a last-resort link to prevent\n       traffic disruption
    when alternate paths are not available.\n"

      I.x represent the interface\n   address on Router A's side, and I.y and I.z
      represent interface\n   addresses on Router B's side.  The Extended Link Opaque
      LSA as\n   defined in [RFC7684] describes links using Link Type, Link ID, and\n
      \  Link Data.  For example, a link with the address I.w is described as\n   below
      on Router A.\n      Link Type = Point-to-point\n      Link ID = Router ID of
      B\n      Link Data = I.w\n   A third node (controller or head-end) in the network
      cannot\n   distinguish the interface on Router B, which is connected to this\n
      \  particular Interface on Router A based on the link information\n   described
      above.  The interface with address I.y or I.z could be\n   chosen due to this
      ambiguity.  In such cases, a Remote IPv4 Address\n   sub-TLV should be originated
      and added to the Extended Link TLV.  The\n   use cases as described in Section
      7 require controller or head-end\n   nodes to interpret the graceful-link-shutdown
      information and hence\n   the need for the Remote IPv4 Address sub-TLV.  I.y
      is carried in the\n   Extended Link TLV, which unambiguously identifies the
      interface on\n   the remote side.  The OSPFv3 Router-Link TLV as described in\n
      \  [RFC8362] contains an Interface ID and a neighbor's Interface ID,\n   which
      can uniquely identify connecting the interface on the remote\n   side; hence,
      OSPFv3 does not require a separate remote IPv6 address\n   to be advertised
      along with the OSPFv3 Graceful-Link-Shutdown\n   sub-TLV.\n"

  - "5.  Elements of Procedure\n   As defined in [RFC7684], every link on the node
    will have a separate\n   Extended Link Opaque LSA.  The node that has the link
    to be taken out\n   of service MUST advertise the Graceful-Link-Shutdown sub-TLV
    in the\n   Extended Link TLV of the Extended Link Opaque LSA for OSPFv2, as\n
    \  defined in [RFC7684], and in the Router-Link TLV of E-Router-LSA for\n   OSPFv3.
    \ The Graceful-Link-Shutdown sub-TLV indicates that the link\n   identified by
    the sub-TLV is subjected to maintenance.\n   For the purposes of changing the
    metric OSPFv2 and OSPFv3 Router-LSAs\n   need to be reoriginated.  To change the
    Traffic Engineering metric,\n   TE Opaque LSAs in OSPFv2 [RFC3630] and Intra-area-TE-LSAs
    in OSPFv3\n   [RFC5329] need to be reoriginated.\n   The graceful-link-shutdown
    information is advertised as a property of\n   the link and is flooded through
    the area.  This information can be\n   used by ingress routers or controllers
    to take special actions.  An\n   application specific to this use case is described
    in Section 7.2.\n   When a link is ready to carry traffic, the Graceful-Link-Shutdown\n
    \  sub-TLV MUST be removed from the Extended Link TLV/Router-Link TLV,\n   and
    the corresponding LSAs MUST be readvertised.  Similarly, the\n   metric MUST be
    set to original values, and the corresponding LSAs\n   MUST be readvertised.\n
    \  The procedures described in this document may be used to divert the\n   traffic
    away from the link in scenarios other than link-shutdown or\n   link-replacement
    activity.\n   The precise action taken by the remote node at the other end of
    the\n   link identified for graceful-shutdown depends on the link type.\n"
  - contents:
    - "5.1.  Point-to-Point Links\n   The node that has the link to be taken out of
      service MUST set the\n   metric of the link to MaxLinkMetric (0xffff) and reoriginate
      its\n   Router-LSA.  The Traffic Engineering metric of the link SHOULD be set\n
      \  to (0xffffffff), and the node SHOULD reoriginate the corresponding TE\n   Link
      Opaque LSAs.  When a Graceful-Link-Shutdown sub-TLV is received\n   for a point-to-point
      link, the remote node MUST identify the local\n   link that corresponds to the
      graceful-shutdown link and set its\n   metric to MaxLinkMetric (0xffff), and
      the remote node MUST\n   reoriginate its Router-LSA with the changed metric.
      \ When TE is\n   enabled, the Traffic Engineering metric of the link SHOULD
      be set to\n   (0xffffffff) and follow the procedures in [RFC5817].  Similarly,
      the\n   remote node SHOULD set the Traffic Engineering metric of the link to\n
      \  0xffffffff and SHOULD reoriginate the TE Link Opaque LSA for the link\n   with
      the new value.\n   The Extended Link Opaque LSAs and the Extended Link TLV are

      networks in OSPF are\n   represented by a star topology where the Designated
      Router (DR) is\n   the central point to which all other routers on the broadcast
      or NBMA\n   network logically connect.  As a result, routers on the broadcast
      or\n   NBMA network advertise only their adjacency to the DR.  Routers that\n
      \  do not act as DRs do not form or advertise adjacencies with each\n   other.
      \ For the broadcast links, the MaxLinkMetric on the remote link\n   cannot be
      changed since all the neighbors are on same link.  Setting\n   the link cost
      to MaxLinkMetric would impact all paths that traverse\n   any of the neighbors
      connected on that broadcast link.\n   The node that has the link to be taken
      out of service MUST set the\n   metric of the link to MaxLinkMetric (0xffff)
      and reoriginate the\n   Router-LSA.  The Traffic Engineering metric of the link
      SHOULD be set\n   to (0xffffffff), and the node SHOULD reoriginate the corresponding

      connecting\n   different locations.  The customer's IGP protocol creates a seamless\n
      \  private network (overlay network) across the locations for the\n   customer.
      \ Service providers want to offer graceful-shutdown\n   functionality when the
      PE device is taken out for maintenance.  There\n   can be large number of customers
      attached to a PE node, and the\n   remote endpoints for these L2 attachment
      circuits are spread across\n   the service provider's network.  Changing the
      metric for all\n   corresponding L2 circuits in both directions is a tedious
      and error-\n   prone process.  The graceful-link-shutdown feature simplifies
      the\n   process by increasing the metric on the CE-CE overlay link so that\n
      \  traffic in both directions is diverted away from the PE undergoing\n   maintenance.
      \ The graceful-link-shutdown feature allows the link to\n   be used as a last-resort
      link so that traffic is not disrupted when\n   alternate paths are not available.\n
