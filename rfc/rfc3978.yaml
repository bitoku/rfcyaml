  - "Abstract\n   The IETF policies about rights in Contributions to the IETF are\n\
    \   designed to ensure that such Contributions can be made available to\n   the\
    \ IETF and Internet communities while permitting the authors to\n   retain as\
    \ many rights as possible.  This memo details the IETF\n   policies on rights\
    \ in Contributions to the IETF.  It also describes\n   the objectives that the\
    \ policies are designed to meet.  This memo\n   updates RFC 2026, and, with RFC\

    \ places on\n      the Internet, and not all of these places remove expired\n\
    \      Internet-Drafts.  Internet-Drafts that are under active\n      consideration\
    \ by the IESG are not removed from the Secretariat's\n      public directory until\
    \ that consideration is complete.  In\n      addition, the author of an Internet-Draft\

    \  Note that under Section 3.3(a) the grant of rights\n      in regards to IETF\
    \ Internet-Drafts as specified in this document\n      is perpetual and irrevocable\
    \ and thus survives the Secretariat's\n      removal of an Internet-Draft from\
    \ the public directory, except as\n      limited by Section 3.3(a)(C).  (See [RFC2026]\
    \ Sections 2.2 and 8)\n   h. \"IETF Documents\":  RFCs and Internet-Drafts except\
    \ for Internet-\n      Drafts that are RFC Editor Contributions and the RFCs that\
    \ are\n      published from them.\n   i. \"RFC Editor Documents\":  RFCs and Internet-Drafts\

    \ from them.\n   j. \"Contribution\": IETF Contributions and RFC Editor Contributions.\n\
    \   k. \"Contributor\": an individual submitting a Contribution.\n   l. \"Reasonably\
    \ and personally known\": means something an individual\n      knows personally\
    \ or, because of the job the individual holds,\n      would reasonably be expected\
    \ to know.  This wording is used to\n      indicate that an organization cannot\
    \ purposely keep an individual\n      in the dark about patents or patent applications\
    \ just to avoid the\n      disclosure requirement.  But this requirement should\
    \ not be\n      interpreted as requiring the IETF Contributor or participant (or\n\
    \      his or her represented organization, if any) to perform a patent\n    \
    \  search to find applicable IPR.\n"
- title: 2.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "2.  Introduction\n   Under the laws of most countries and current international\
    \ treaties\n   (for example the \"Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary\
    \ and\n   Artistic Work\" [Berne]), authors obtain numerous rights in the works\n\
    \   they produce automatically upon producing them.  These rights include\n  \
    \ copyrights, moral rights and other rights.  In many cases, if the\n   author\
    \ produces a work within the scope of his or her employment,\n   most of those\
    \ rights are usually assigned to the employer, either by\n   operation of law\
    \ or, in many cases, under contract.  (The Berne\n   Convention names some rights\
    \ as \"inalienable\", which means that the\n   author retains them in all cases.)\n\
    \   This document details the rights that the IETF requires in IETF\n   Contributions\
    \ and rights the IETF, as publisher of Internet-Drafts,\n   requires in all such\
    \ Drafts including RFC Editor Contributions.  The\n   RFC Editor may also define\
    \ additional rights required for RFC Editor\n   Contributions.\n   In order for\
    \ works to be used within the IETF Standards Process or to\n   be published as\
    \ Internet-Drafts, certain limited rights in all\n   Contributions must be granted\
    \ to the IETF and Internet Society\n   (ISOC).  In addition, Contributors must\
    \ make representations to IETF\n   and ISOC regarding their ability to grant these\
    \ rights.  These\n   necessary rights and representations have until now been\
    \ laid out in\n   Section 10 of [RFC2026].  In the years since [RFC2026] was published\n\
    \   there have been a number of times when the exact intent of Section 10\n  \
    \ has been the subject of vigorous debate within the IETF community.\n   The aim\
    \ of this document is to clarify various ambiguities in Section\n   10 of [RFC2026]\
    \ that led to these debates and to amplify the policy\n   in order to clarify\
    \ what the IETF is currently doing.\n   Section 1 gives definitions used in describing\
    \ these policies.\n   Sections 3, 4, 5, and 6 of this document address the rights\
    \ in\n   Contributions previously covered by Section 10 of [RFC2026] and the\n\
    \   \"Note Well\" explanatory text presented at many IETF activities.\n   Sections\
    \ 7 and 8 then explain the rationale for these provisions,\n   including some\
    \ of the clarifications that have become understood\n   since the adoption of\
    \ [RFC2026].  The rules and procedures set out in\n   this document are not intended\
    \ to substantially modify or alter the\n   IETF's current policy toward Contributions.\n\
    \   A companion document [RFC3979] deals with rights in technologies\n   developed\
    \ or specified as part of the IETF Standards Process.  This\n   document is not\
    \ intended to address those issues.\n   The rights addressed in this document\
    \ fall into the following\n   categories:\n   o  rights to make use of contributed\
    \ material\n   o  copyrights in IETF documents\n   o  rights to produce derivative\
    \ works\n   o  rights to use trademarks\n   This document is not intended as legal\
    \ advice.  Readers are advised\n   to consult their own legal advisors if they\
    \ would like a legal\n   interpretation of their rights or the rights of the IETF\
    \ in any\n   Contributions they make.\n"

    \   the IETF Standards Process, and there must be no assumption of any\n   confidentiality\
    \ obligation with respect to any Contribution.  Each\n   Contributor agrees that\

    \ IETF Documents\n   (including copies, derivative works and translations of IETF\n\
    \   Documents, but subject to the limited exceptions noted in Section\n   5.2).\
    \  This requirement protects IETF and its participants from\n   liabilities connected\

    \ aspects of the document, such\n   as its layout, the RFC numbering convention\
    \ and the prefatory\n   language of the document.  This legend is not intended\
    \ to imply that\n   ISOC has obtained ownership of the IETF Contribution itself,\

    \ document or\n   with most working group documents, except as discussed in Section\
    \ 7.3\n   below, since the IETF must retain change control over its documents\n\
    \   and the ability to augment, clarify and enhance the original IETF\n   Contribution\
    \ in accordance with the IETF Standards Process.\n   Notice 5.2(a) may be appropriate\
    \ when republishing standards produced\n   by other (non-IETF) standards organizations,\
    \ industry consortia or\n   companies.  These are typically published as Informational\
    \ RFCs, and\n   do not require that change control be ceded to the IETF.  Basically,\n\

  contents:
  - "7.1.  Rights Granted in IETF Contributions\n   The IETF/ISOC must obtain the\
    \ right to publish an IETF Contribution\n   as an RFC or an Internet-Draft from\
    \ the Contributors.\n   A primary objective of this policy is to obtain from the\
    \ document\n   authors only the non-exclusive rights that are needed to develop\
    \ and\n   publish IETF Documents and to use the IETF Contributions in the IETF\n\
    \   Standards Process while leaving all other rights with the authors.\n   The\
    \ non-exclusive rights that the IETF needs are:\n   a. the right to publish the\
    \ document\n   b. the right to let the document be freely reproduced in the formats\n\
    \      that the IETF publishes it in\n   c. the right to let third parties translate\
    \ it into languages other\n      than English\n   d. except where explicitly excluded\
    \ (see Section 5.2), the right to\n      make derivative works within the IETF\
    \ process.\n   e. the right to let third parties extract some logical parts, for\n\
    \      example MIB modules\n   The authors retain all other rights, but cannot\
    \ withdraw the above\n   rights from the IETF/ISOC.\n"
- title: 7.2.  Rights to use Contributed Material
  contents:
  - "7.2.  Rights to use Contributed Material\n   Because, under the laws of most\
    \ countries and applicable\n   international treaties, copyright rights come into\
    \ existence whenever\n   a work of authorship is created (but see Section 8 below\
    \ regarding\n   public domain documents), and IETF cannot make use of IETF\n \
    \  Contributions if it does not have sufficient rights with respect to\n   these\
    \ copyright rights, it is important that the IETF receive\n   assurances from\
    \ all Contributors that they have the authority to\n   grant the IETF the rights\
    \ that they claim to grant.  Without this\n   assurance, IETF and its participants\
    \ would run a greater risk of\n   liability to the owners of these rights.\n \
    \  To this end, IETF asks Contributors to give the assurances in Section\n   3.4\
    \ above.  These assurances are requested, however, only to the\n   extent of the\
    \ Contributor's reasonable and personal knowledge.  (See\n   Section 1(l))\n"
- title: 7.3.  Right to Produce Derivative Works
  contents:
  - "7.3.  Right to Produce Derivative Works\n   The IETF needs to be able to evolve\
    \ IETF Documents in response to\n   experience gained in the deployment of the\
    \ technologies described in\n   such IETF Documents, to incorporate developments\
    \ in research and to\n   react to changing conditions on the Internet and other\
    \ IP networks.\n   In order to do this the IETF must be able to produce derivatives\
    \ of\n   its documents; thus the IETF must obtain the right from Contributors\n\
    \   to produce derivative works.  Note though that the IETF only requires\n  \
    \ this right for the production of derivative works within the IETF\n   Standards\
    \ Process.  The IETF does not need, nor does it obtain, the\n   right to let derivative\
    \ works be created outside of the IETF\n   Standards Process other than as noted\
    \ in Section 3.3 (E).\n   The right to produce derivative works is required for\
    \ all IETF\n   standards track documents and for most IETF non-standards track\n\
    \   documents.  There are two exceptions to this requirement:  documents\n   describing\
    \ proprietary technologies and documents that are\n   republications of the work\
    \ of other standards organizations.\n   The right to produce derivative works\
    \ must be granted in order for an\n   IETF working group to accept an IETF Contribution\
    \ as a working group\n   document or otherwise work on it.  For non-working group\
    \ IETF\n   Contributions where the Contributor requests publication as a\n   standards\
    \ track RFC the right to produce derivative works must be\n   granted before the\
    \ IESG will issue an IETF Last-Call and, for most\n   non-standards track non-working\
    \ group IETF Contributions, before the\n   IESG will consider the Internet-Draft\
    \ for publication.\n   Occasionally a Contributor may not want to grant publication\
    \ rights\n   or the right to produce derivative works before finding out if an\n\
    \   IETF Contribution has been accepted for development in the IETF\n   Standards\
    \ Process.  In these cases the Contributor may include the\n   Derivative Works\
    \ Limitation described in Section 5.2 and the\n   Publication Limitation described\
    \ in Section 5.3 in their IETF\n   Contribution.  A working group can discuss\
    \ the Internet-Draft with\n   the aim to decide if it should become a working\
    \ group document, even\n   though the right to produce derivative works or to\
    \ publish the IETF\n   Contribution as an RFC has not yet been granted.  If the\
    \ IETF\n   Contribution is accepted for development the Contributor must then\n\
    \   resubmit the IETF Contribution without the limitation notices before\n   a\
    \ working group can formally adopt the IETF Contribution as a working\n   group\
    \ document.\n   The IETF has historically encouraged organizations to publish\
    \ details\n   of their technologies, even when the technologies are proprietary,\n\
    \   because understanding how existing technology is being used helps\n   when\
    \ developing new technology.  But organizations that publish\n   information about\
    \ proprietary technologies are frequently not willing\n   to have the IETF produce\
    \ revisions of the technologies and then claim\n   that the IETF version is the\
    \ \"new version\" of the organization's\n   technology.  Organizations that feel\
    \ this way can specify that an\n   IETF Contribution can be published with the\
    \ other rights granted\n   under this document but may withhold the right to produce\
    \ derivative\n   works other than translations.  The right to produce translations\
    \ is\n   required before any IETF Contribution can be published as an RFC to\n\
    \   ensure the widest possible distribution of the material in RFCs.\n   In addition,\
    \ IETF Documents frequently make normative references to\n   standards or recommendations\
    \ developed by other standards\n   organizations.  Since the publications of some\
    \ standards\n   organizations are not public documents, it can be quite helpful\
    \ to\n   the IETF to republish, with the permission of the other standards\n \
    \  organization, some of these documents as RFCs so that the IETF\n   community\
    \ can have open access to them to better understand what they\n   are referring\
    \ to.  In these cases the RFCs can be published without\n   the right for the\
    \ IETF to produce derivative works.\n   In both of the above cases in which the\
    \ production of derivative\n   works is excluded, the Contributor must include\
    \ a special legend in\n   the IETF Contribution, as specified in Section 5.2,\
    \ in order to\n   notify IETF participants about this restriction.\n"

    \ rights.\n   However, the IETF requires each Contributor, under the licenses\n\
    \   described in Section 3.3 above, to grant IETF a perpetual license to\n   use\
    \ any such trademarks or service marks solely in exercising its\n   rights to\
