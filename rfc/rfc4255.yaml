  - "1.  Introduction\n   The SSH [6] protocol provides secure remote login and other\
    \ secure\n   network services over an insecure network.  The security of the\n\
    \   connection relies on the server authenticating itself to the client\n   as\
    \ well as the user authenticating itself to the server.\n   If a connection is\
    \ established to a server whose public key is not\n   already known to the client,\
    \ a fingerprint of the key is presented to\n   the user for verification.  If\
    \ the user decides that the fingerprint\n   is correct and accepts the key, the\
    \ key is saved locally and used for\n   verification for all following connections.\
    \  While some security-\n   conscious users verify the fingerprint out-of-band\
    \ before accepting\n   the key, many users blindly accept the presented key.\n\
    \   The method described here can provide out-of-band verification by\n   looking\
    \ up a fingerprint of the server public key in the DNS [1][2]\n   and using DNSSEC\
    \ [5] to verify the lookup.\n   In order to distribute the fingerprint using DNS,\
    \ this document\n   defines a new DNS resource record, \"SSHFP\", to carry the\
    \ fingerprint.\n   Basic understanding of the DNS system [1][2] and the DNS security\n\
    \   extensions [5] is assumed by this document.\n   The key words \"MUST\", \"\
    MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\"\
    , \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n   document are to be interpreted\
    \ as described in RFC 2119 [3].\n"

  contents:
  - "2.1.  Method\n   Upon connection to an SSH server, the SSH client MAY look up\
    \ the\n   SSHFP resource record(s) for the host it is connecting to.  If the\n\
    \   algorithm and fingerprint of the key received from the SSH server\n   match\
    \ the algorithm and fingerprint of one of the SSHFP resource\n   record(s) returned\
    \ from DNS, the client MAY accept the identity of\n   the server.\n"
- title: 2.2.  Implementation Notes
  contents:
  - "2.2.  Implementation Notes\n   Client implementors SHOULD provide a configurable\
    \ policy used to\n   select the order of methods used to verify a host key.  This\
    \ document\n   defines one method: Fingerprint storage in DNS.  Another method\n\
    \   defined in the SSH Architecture [6] uses local files to store keys\n   for\
    \ comparison.  Other methods that could be defined in the future\n   might include\
    \ storing fingerprints in LDAP or other databases.  A\n   configurable policy\
    \ will allow administrators to determine which\n   methods they want to use and\
    \ in what order the methods should be\n   prioritized.  This will allow administrators\
    \ to determine how much\n   trust they want to place in the different methods.\n\
    \   One specific scenario for having a configurable policy is where\n   clients\
    \ do not use fully qualified host names to connect to servers.\n   In this scenario,\
    \ the implementation SHOULD verify the host key\n   against a local database before\
    \ verifying the key via the fingerprint\n   returned from DNS.  This would help\
    \ prevent an attacker from\n   injecting a DNS search path into the local resolver\
    \ and forcing the\n   client to connect to a different host.\n"
- title: 2.3.  Fingerprint Matching
  contents:
  - "2.3.  Fingerprint Matching\n   The public key and the SSHFP resource record are\
    \ matched together by\n   comparing algorithm number and fingerprint.\n      The\
    \ public key algorithm and the SSHFP algorithm number MUST\n      match.\n   \
    \   A message digest of the public key, using the message digest\n      algorithm\
    \ specified in the SSHFP fingerprint type, MUST match the\n      SSHFP fingerprint.\n"
- title: 2.4.  Authentication
  contents:
  - "2.4.  Authentication\n   A public key verified using this method MUST NOT be\
    \ trusted if the\n   SSHFP resource record (RR) used for verification was not\n\
    \   authenticated by a trusted SIG RR.\n   Clients that do validate the DNSSEC\
    \ signatures themselves SHOULD use\n   standard DNSSEC validation procedures.\n\
    \   Clients that do not validate the DNSSEC signatures themselves MUST\n   use\
    \ a secure transport (e.g., TSIG [9], SIG(0) [10], or IPsec [8])\n   between themselves\
    \ and the entity performing the signature\n   validation.\n"

- title: 4.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "4.  Security Considerations\n   Currently, the amount of trust a user can realistically\
    \ place in a\n   server key is proportional to the amount of attention paid to\n\
    \   verifying that the public key presented actually corresponds to the\n   private\
    \ key of the server.  If a user accepts a key without verifying\n   the fingerprint\
    \ with something learned through a secured channel, the\n   connection is vulnerable\
    \ to a man-in-the-middle attack.\n   The overall security of using SSHFP for SSH\
    \ host key verification is\n   dependent on the security policies of the SSH host\
    \ administrator and\n   DNS zone administrator (in transferring the fingerprint),\
    \ detailed\n   aspects of how verification is done in the SSH implementation,\
    \ and in\n   the client's diligence in accessing the DNS in a secure manner.\n\
    \   One such aspect is in which order fingerprints are looked up (e.g.,\n   first\
    \ checking local file and then SSHFP).  We note that, in addition\n   to protecting\
    \ the first-time transfer of host keys, SSHFP can\n   optionally be used for stronger\
    \ host key protection.\n      If SSHFP is checked first, new SSH host keys may\
    \ be distributed by\n      replacing the corresponding SSHFP in DNS.\n      If\
    \ SSH host key verification can be configured to require SSHFP,\n      SSH host\
    \ key revocation can be implemented by removing the\n      corresponding SSHFP\
    \ from DNS.\n   As stated in Section 2.2, we recommend that SSH implementors provide\n\
    \   a policy mechanism to control the order of methods used for host key\n   verification.\
    \  One specific scenario for having a configurable policy\n   is where clients\
    \ use unqualified host names to connect to servers.\n   In this case, we recommend\
    \ that SSH implementations check the host\n   key against a local database before\
    \ verifying the key via the\n   fingerprint returned from DNS.  This would help\
    \ prevent an attacker\n   from injecting a DNS search path into the local resolver\
    \ and forcing\n   the client to connect to a different host.\n   A different approach\
    \ to solve the DNS search path issue would be for\n   clients to use a trusted\
    \ DNS search path, i.e., one not acquired\n   through DHCP or other autoconfiguration\
    \ mechanisms.  Since there is\n   no way with current DNS lookup APIs to tell\
    \ whether a search path is\n   from a trusted source, the entire client system\
    \ would need to be\n   configured with this trusted DNS search path.\n   Another\
    \ dependency is on the implementation of DNSSEC itself.  As\n   stated in Section\
    \ 2.4, we mandate the use of secure methods for\n   lookup and that SSHFP RRs\
    \ are authenticated by trusted SIG RRs.  This\n   is especially important if SSHFP\
    \ is to be used as a basis for host\n   key rollover and/or revocation, as described\
    \ above.\n   Since DNSSEC only protects the integrity of the host key fingerprint\n\
    \   after it is signed by the DNS zone administrator, the fingerprint\n   must\
    \ be transferred securely from the SSH host administrator to the\n   DNS zone\
    \ administrator.  This could be done manually between the\n   administrators or\
    \ automatically using secure DNS dynamic update [11]\n   between the SSH server\
    \ and the nameserver.  We note that this is no\n   different from other key enrollment\
    \ situations, e.g., a client\n   sending a certificate request to a certificate\
    \ authority for signing.\n"
