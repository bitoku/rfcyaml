  - "1.  Introduction\n   When outages in a network are planned (e.g., for maintenance\n\
    \   purposes), some mechanisms can be used to avoid traffic disruption.\n   This\
    \ is in contrast with unplanned network element failure, where\n   traffic disruption\
    \ can be minimized thanks to recovery mechanisms,\n   but may not be avoided.\
    \  Therefore, a Service Provider may desire to\n   gracefully (temporarily or\
    \ indefinitely) remove a TE link, a group of\n   TE links, or an entire node for\
    \ administrative reasons such as link\n   maintenance, software/hardware upgrade\
    \ at a node, or significant TE\n   configuration changes.  In all these cases,\
    \ the goal is to minimize\n   the impact on the traffic carried over TE LSPs in\
    \ the network by\n   triggering notifications so as to gracefully reroute such\
    \ flows\n   before the administrative procedures are started.\n   These operations\
    \ are equally applicable to both MPLS-TE [RFC3209] and\n   its Generalized MPLS\
    \ (GMPLS) extensions [RFC3471] [RFC3473].\n   This document describes the mechanisms\
    \ that can be used to gracefully\n   shut down MPLS-TE / GMPLS-TE on a resource\
    \ such as a TE link, a\n   component link within a bundled TE link, a label resource,\
    \ or an\n   entire TE node.\n   Graceful shutdown of a resource may require several\
    \ steps.  These\n   steps can be broadly divided into two sets: disabling the\
    \ resource in\n   the control plane and disabling the resource in the data plane.\
    \  The\n   node initiating the graceful shutdown condition introduces a delay\n\
    \   between the two sets to allow the control plane to gracefully divert\n   the\
    \ traffic away from the resource being gracefully shut down.  The\n   trigger\
    \ for the graceful shutdown event is a local matter at the node\n   initiating\
    \ the graceful shutdown.  Typically, graceful shutdown is\n   triggered for administrative\
    \ reasons, such as link maintenance or\n   software/hardware upgrade.\n"

- title: 3.  Requirements for Graceful Shutdown
  contents:
  - "3.  Requirements for Graceful Shutdown\n   This section lists the requirements\
    \ for graceful shutdown in the\n   context of GMPLS.\n   - Graceful shutdown is\
    \ required to address graceful removal of one TE\n     link, one component link\
    \ within a bundled TE link, a set of TE\n     links, a set of component links,\
    \ label resources, or an entire\n     node.\n   - Once an operator has initiated\
    \ graceful shutdown of a network\n     resource, no new TE LSPs may be set up\
    \ that use the resource.  Any\n     signaling message for a new TE LSP that explicitly\
    \ specifies the\n     resource, or that would require the use of the resource\
    \ due to\n     local constraints, is required to be rejected as if the resource\n\
    \     were unavailable.\n   - It is desirable for new TE LSP set-up attempts that\
    \ would be\n     rejected because of graceful shutdown of a resource (as described\n\
    \     in the previous requirement) to avoid any attempt to use the\n     resource\
    \ by selecting an alternate route or other resources.\n   - If the resource being\
    \ shut down is a last-resort resource, based on\n     a local decision, the node\
    \ initiating the graceful shutdown\n     procedure can cancel the shutdown operation.\n\
    \   - It is required to give the ingress node the opportunity to take\n     actions\
    \ in order to reduce or eliminate traffic disruption on the\n     TE LSPs that\
    \ are using the network resources that are about to be\n     shut down.\n   -\
    \ Graceful shutdown mechanisms are equally applicable to intra-domain\n     TE\
    \ LSPs and those spanning multiple domains, as defined in\n     [RFC4726].  Examples\
    \ of such domains include IGP areas and\n     Autonomous Systems.\n   - Graceful\
    \ shutdown is equally applicable to packet and non-packet\n     networks.\n  \
    \ - In order to make rerouting effective, it is required that when a\n     node\
    \ initiates the graceful shutdown of a resource, it notifies all\n     other network\
    \ nodes about the TE resource under graceful shutdown.\n   - Depending on switching\
    \ technology, it may be possible to shut down\n     a label resource, e.g., shutting\
    \ down a lambda in a Lambda Switch\n     Capable (LSC) node.\n"
- title: 4.  Mechanisms for Graceful Shutdown
  contents:
  - "4.  Mechanisms for Graceful Shutdown\n   An IGP-only solution based on [RFC3630],\
    \ [RFC5305], [RFC4203] and\n   [RFC5307] is not applicable when dealing with inter-area\
    \ and inter-AS\n   traffic engineering, as IGP flooding is restricted to IGP\n\
    \   areas/levels.  An RSVP-based solution is proposed in this document to\n  \
    \ handle TE LSPs spanning multiple domains.  In addition, in order to\n   discourage\
    \ nodes from establishing new TE LSPs through the resources\n   being shut down,\
    \ existing IGP mechanisms are used for the shutdown\n   notification.\n   A node\
    \ where a link or the whole node is being shut down first\n   triggers the IGP\
    \ updates as described in Section 4.1 and then, with\n   some delay to allow network\
    \ convergence, uses the signaling mechanism\n   described in Section 4.2.\n"
- title: 4.1.  OSPF / IS-IS Mechanisms for Graceful Shutdown
  contents:
  - "4.1.  OSPF / IS-IS Mechanisms for Graceful Shutdown\n   This section describes\
    \ the use of existing OSPF and IS-IS mechanisms\n   for the graceful shutdown\
    \ in GMPLS networks.\n   The OSPF and IS-IS procedures for graceful shutdown of\
    \ TE links are\n   similar to the graceful restart of OSPF and IS-IS as described\
    \ in\n   [RFC4203] and [RFC5307], respectively.  Specifically, the node where\n\
    \   graceful shutdown of a link is desired originates the TE LSA or IS-\n   IS-LSP\
    \ containing a Link TLV for the link under graceful shutdown\n   with the Traffic\
    \ Engineering metric set to 0xffffffff, 0 as\n   unreserved bandwidth.  If the\
    \ TE link has LSC or FSC as its Switching\n   Capability, then it also has 0 in\
    \ the \"Max LSP Bandwidth\" field of\n   the Interface Switching Capability Descriptor\
    \ (ISCD) sub-TLV.  A node\n   may also specify a value that is greater than the\
    \ available bandwidth\n   in the \"Minimum LSP bandwidth\" field of the same ISCD\
    \ sub-TLV.  This\n   would discourage new TE LSP establishment through the link\
    \ under\n   graceful shutdown.\n   If the graceful shutdown procedure is performed\
    \ for a component link\n   within a TE link bundle and it is not the last component\
    \ link\n   available within the TE link, the link attributes associated with the\n\
    \   TE link are recomputed.  Similarly, if the graceful shutdown\n   procedure\
    \ is performed on a label resource within a TE link, the link\n   attributes associated\
    \ with the TE link are recomputed.  If the\n   removal of the component link or\
    \ label resource results in a\n   significant bandwidth change event, a new LSA\
    \ is originated with the\n   new traffic parameters.  If the last component link\
    \ is being shut\n   down, the routing procedure related to TE link removal is\
    \ used.\n   Neighbors of the node where graceful shutdown procedure is in\n  \
    \ progress continue to advertise the actual unreserved bandwidth of the\n   TE\
    \ links from the neighbors to that node, without any routing\n   adjacency change.\n\
    \   When graceful shutdown at node level is desired, the node in question\n  \
    \ follows the procedure specified in the previous section for all TE\n   links.\n"
- title: 4.2 RSVP-TE Signaling Mechanisms for Graceful Shutdown
  contents:
  - "4.2 RSVP-TE Signaling Mechanisms for Graceful Shutdown\n   As discussed in Section\
    \ 3, one of the requirements for the signaling\n   mechanism for graceful shutdown\
    \ is to carry information about the\n   resource under graceful shutdown.  For\
    \ this purpose, the graceful\n   shutdown procedure uses TE LSP rerouting mechanism\
    \ as defined in\n   [RFC5710].\n   Specifically, the node where graceful shutdown\
    \ of an unbundled TE\n   link or an entire bundled TE link is desired triggers\
    \ a PathErr\n   message with the error code \"Notify\" and error value \"Local\
    \ link\n   maintenance required\", for all affected TE LSPs.  Similarly, the node\n\
    \   that is being gracefully shut down triggers a PathErr message with\n   the\
    \ error code \"Notify\" and error value \"Local node maintenance\n   required\"\
    , for all TE LSPs.  For graceful shutdown of a node, an\n   unbundled TE link,\
    \ or an entire bundled TE link, the PathErr message\n   may contain either an\
    \ [RFC2205] format ERROR_SPEC object or an IF_ID\n   [RFC3473] format ERROR_SPEC\
    \ object.  In either case, it is the\n   address and TLVs carried by the ERROR_SPEC\
    \ object and not the error\n   value that indicate the resource that is to be\
    \ gracefully shut down.\n   MPLS-TE link bundling [RFC4201] requires that an TE\
    \ LSP is pinned\n   down to a component link.  Consequently, graceful shutdown\
    \ of a\n   component link in a bundled TE link differs from graceful shutdown\
    \ of\n   unbundled TE link or entire bundled TE link.  Specifically, in the\n\
    \   former case, when only a subset of component links and not the entire\n  \
    \ bundled TE link is being shut down, the remaining component links of\n   the\
    \ bundled TE link may still be able to admit new TE LSPs.  The node\n   where\
    \ graceful shutdown of a component link is desired triggers a\n   PathErr message\
    \ with the error code \"Notify\" and error value of\n   \"Local link maintenance\
    \ required\".  The rest of the ERROR_SPEC object\n   is constructed using Component\
    \ Reroute Request procedure defined in\n   [RFC5710].\n   If graceful shutdown\
    \ of a label resource is desired, the node\n   initiating this action triggers\
    \ a PathErr message with the error\n   codes and error values of \"Notify/Local\
    \ link maintenance required\".\n   The rest of the ERROR_SPEC object is constructed\
    \ using the Label\n   Reroute Request procedure defined in [RFC5710].\n   When\
    \ a head-end node, a transit node, or a border node receives a\n   PathErr message\
    \ with the error code \"Notify\" and error value \"Local\n   link maintenance\
    \ required\" or \"Local node maintenance required\", it\n   follows the procedures\
    \ defined in [RFC5710] to reroute the traffic\n   around the resource being gracefully\
    \ shut down.  When performing path\n   computation for the new TE LSP, the head-end\
    \ node or border node\n   avoids using the TE resources identified by the ERROR_SPEC\
    \ object.\n   If the PCE is used for path computation, the head-end (or border)\n\
    \   node acting as PCC specifies in its requests to the PCE that path\n   computation\
    \ should avoid the resource being gracefully shut down.\n   The amount of time\
    \ the head-end node or border node avoids using the\n   TE resources identified\
    \ by the IP address contained in the PathErr is\n   based on a local decision\
    \ at that node.\n   If the node initiating the graceful shutdown procedure receives\
    \ a\n   path setup request for a new tunnel-using resource being gracefully\n\
    \   shut down, it sends a PathErr message with \"Notify\" error code in the\n\
    \   ERROR SPEC object and an error value consistent with the type of\n   resource\
    \ being gracefully shut down.  However, based on a local\n   decision, if an existing\
    \ tunnel continues to use the resource being\n   gracefully shut down, the node\
    \ initiating the graceful shutdown\n   procedure may allow that resource being\
    \ gracefully shut down to be\n   used as a \"last resort\".  The node initiating\
    \ the graceful shutdown\n   procedure can distinguish between new and existing\
    \ tunnels by\n   inspecting the SENDER TEMPLATE and SESSION objects.\n   If the\
    \ resource being shut down is a last-resort resource, it can be\n   used; i.e.,\
    \ based on a local decision, the node initiating the\n   graceful shutdown procedure\
    \ can cancel the shutdown operation.\n   Similarly, based on a local decision,\
    \ the node initiating the\n   graceful shutdown procedure can delay the actual\
    \ removal of resource\n   for forwarding.  This is to give time to the network\
    \ to move traffic\n   from the resource being shut down.  For this purpose, the\
    \ node\n   initiating graceful shutdown procedure follows the Reroute Request\n\
    \   Timeout procedure defined in [RFC5710].\n"
