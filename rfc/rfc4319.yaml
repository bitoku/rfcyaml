    \ the documents that describe the current\n   Internet-Standard Management Framework,\
    \ please refer to Section 7 of\n   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].\n   Managed objects are\
    \ accessed via a virtual information store, termed\n   the Management Information\
    \ Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally\n   accessed through the Simple Network\
    \ Management Protocol (SNMP).\n   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms\
    \ defined in the\n   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies\
    \ a MIB\n   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,\n\

    \ for\n   use with network management protocols in the Internet community for\n\
    \   the purpose of managing HDSL2/SHDSL lines.\n   The MIB module described in\
    \ RFC 3276 [RFC3276] describes objects used\n   for managing High Bit-Rate DSL\
    \ - 2nd generation (HDSL2) [T1E1.4] and\n   Single-Pair High-Speed Digital Subscriber\
    \ Line (SHDSL) interfaces\n   [G.991.2].  These object descriptions are based\
    \ upon the\n   specifications for the HDSL2 and SHDSL Embedded Operations Channel\n\
    \   (EOC), as defined in the American National Standards Institute (ANSI)\n  \
    \ T1E1.4/2000-006 [T1E1.4] and International Telecommunication Union\n   (ITU)\
    \ G.991.2 [G.991.2].\n   This document obsoletes RFC 3276 [RFC3276], which supports\
    \ G.shdsl in\n   that the MIB module described herein supports G.shdsl.bis as\n\
    \   described in the G.991.2 [G.991.2].  In addition, objects have been\n   added\
    \ to improve the management of SHDSL lines.\n   The MIB module is located in the\

  contents:
  - "2.6.  Counters, Interval Buckets, and Thresholds\n   For SNR Margin, Loop Attenuation,\
    \ ES, SES, CRC anomalies, LOSW, and\n   UAS, there are event counters, current\
    \ 15-minute and 0 to 96 15-\n   minute history bucket(s) of \"interval-counters\"\
    , as well as current\n   and 0 to 30 previous 1-day interval-counter(s).  Each\
    \ current 15-\n   minute event bucket has an associated threshold notification.\n\
    \   Unlike RFC 3593 [RFC3593] and RFC 2662 [RFC2662], there is no\n   representation\
    \ in the MIB module for invalid buckets.  In those cases\n   where the data for\
    \ an interval is suspect or known to be invalid, the\n   agent MUST NOT report\
    \ the interval.  If the current 15-minute event\n   bucket is determined to be\
    \ invalid, notifications based upon the\n   value of the event bucket MUST NOT\
    \ be generated.\n   Not reporting an interval will result in holes in the associated\n\
    \   table.  For example, the table hdsl2Shdsl15MinIntervalTable is\n   indexed\
    \ by { ifIndex, hdsl2ShdslInvIndex, hdsl2ShdslEndpointSide,\n   hdsl2ShdslEndpointWirePair,\
    \ hdsl2Shdsl15MinIntervalNumber}.  If\n   interval 12 is determined to be invalid\
    \ but intervals 11 and 13 are\n   valid, a Get Next operation on the indices .1.1.1.1.11\
    \ would return\n   indices .1.1.1.1.13.\n   There is no requirement for an agent\
    \ to ensure a fixed relationship\n   between the start of a 15-minute interval\
    \ and any wall clock;\n   however, some implementations may align the 15-minute\
    \ intervals with\n   quarter hours.  Likewise, an implementation may choose to\

  contents:
  - "2.7.  Profiles\n   As a managed node can handle a large number of xUs (e.g.,\
    \ hundreds or\n   perhaps thousands of lines), provisioning every parameter on\
    \ every xU\n   may become burdensome.  Moreover, most lines are provisioned\n\
    \   identically with the same set of parameters.  To simplify the\n   provisioning\
    \ process, this MIB module makes use of profiles.  A\n   profile is a set of parameters\
    \ that can be shared by multiple lines\n   using the same configuration.\n   The\
    \ following profiles are used in this MIB module:\n   o  Span Configuration Profiles\
    \ - Span configuration profiles contain\n      parameters for configuring HDSL2/SHDSL\
    \ spans.  They are defined in\n      the hdsl2ShdslSpanConfProfileTable.  Since\
    \ span configuration\n      parameters are only applicable for SHDSL, the support\
    \ for span\n      configuration profiles is optional for HDSL2 interfaces.\n \
    \     Note that the configuration of the span dictates the behavior for\n    \
    \  each individual segment endpoint in the span.  If a different\n      configuration\
    \ is provisioned for any given segment endpoint within\n      the span, the new\
    \ configuration for this segment endpoint will\n      override the span configuration\
    \ for this segment endpoint only.\n   o  Segment Endpoint Alarm Configuration\
    \ Profiles - These profiles\n      contain parameters for configuring alarm thresholds\
    \ for HDSL2/\n      SHDSL segment endpoints.  These profiles are defined in the\n\
    \      hdsl2ShdslEndpointAlarmConfProfileTable.\n      The index value for this\
    \ profile is a locally-unique\n      administratively-assigned name for the profile\
    \ having the textual\n      convention 'SnmpAdminString' (RFC 3411 [RFC3411]).\n\
    \   One or more lines may be configured to share parameters of a single\n   profile\
    \ (e.g., hdsl2ShdslEndpointAlarmConfProfile = 'silver') by\n   setting its hdsl2ShdslEndpointAlarmConfProfile\
    \ objects to the value\n   of this profile.  If a change is made to the profile,\
    \ all lines that\n   refer to it will be reconfigured to the changed parameters.\
    \  Before a\n   profile can be deleted or taken out of service, it must be first\n\
    \   unreferenced from all associated lines.\n   Implementations MUST provide a\
    \ default profile whose name is 'DEFVAL'\n   for each profile type.  The values\
    \ of the associated parameters will\n   be vendor specific unless otherwise indicated\
    \ in this document.\n   Before a line's profiles have been set, these profiles\
    \ will be\n   automatically used by setting hdsl2ShdslEndpointAlarmConfProfile\
    \ and\n   hdsl2ShdslSpanConfProfile to 'DEFVAL' where appropriate.  This\n   default\
    \ profile name, 'DEFVAL', is considered reserved in the context\n   of profiles\
    \ defined in this MIB module.\n   Profiles are created, assigned, and deleted\
    \ dynamically using the\n   profile name and profile row status in each of the\
    \ four profile\n   tables.\n   Profile changes MUST take effect immediately. \
    \ These changes MAY\n   result in a restart (hard reset or soft restart) of the\
    \ units on the\n   line.\n"
- title: 2.8.  Notifications
  contents:
  - "2.8.  Notifications\n   The ability to generate the SNMP notifications coldStart/warmStart\n\
    \   (per [RFC3418]), which are per agent (e.g., per Digital Subscriber\n   Line\
    \ Access Multiplexer, or DSLAM, in such a device), and linkUp/\n   linkDown (per\
    \ [RFC2863]), which are per interface (i.e., HDSL2/SHDSL\n   line) is required.\n\
    \   A linkDown notification MAY be generated whenever any ES, SES, CRC\n   anomaly,\
    \ LOSW, or UAS event occurs.  The corresponding linkUp\n   notification MAY be\
    \ sent when all link failure conditions are\n   cleared.\n   The notifications\
    \ defined in this MIB module are for initialization\n   failure and for the threshold\
    \ crossings associated with the following\n   events: ES, SES, CRC anomaly, LOSW,\
    \ and UAS.  Each threshold has its\n   own enable/threshold value.  When that\
    \ value is 0, the notification\n   is disabled.\n   The hdsl2ShdslEndpointCurrStatus\
    \ is a bitmask representing all\n   outstanding error conditions associated with\
    \ a particular segment\n   endpoint.  Note that since the status of remote endpoints\
    \ is obtained\n   via the EOC, this information may be unavailable for units that\
    \ are\n   unreachable via EOC during a line error condition.  Therefore, not\n\
    \   all conditions may always be included in its current status.\n   Notifications\
    \ corresponding to the bit fields in this object are\n   defined.\n   Two alarm\
    \ conditions, SNR Margin Alarm and Loop Attenuation Alarm,\n   are organized in\
    \ a manner slightly different from that implied in the\n   EOC specifications.\
    \  In the MIB module, these alarm conditions are\n   tied to the two thresholds,\
    \ hdsl2ShdslEndpointThreshSNRMargin and\n   hdsl2ShdslEndpointThreshLoopAttenuation,\
    \ found in the\n   hdsl2ShdslEndpointAlarmConfProfileTable.  In the EOC, the alarm\n\
    \   conditions associated with these thresholds are per unit.  In the MIB\n  \
    \ module, these alarm conditions are per endpoint.  For terminal units,\n   this\
    \ has no impact.  For repeaters, this implies an implementation\n   variance where\
    \ the agent in the terminal unit is responsible for\n   detecting a threshold\
    \ crossing.  As the reporting of a repeater\n   detected alarm condition to the\
    \ polling terminal unit occurs in the\n   same EOC message as the reporting of\
    \ the current SNR Margin and Loop\n   Attenuation values, it is anticipated that\
    \ this will have very little\n   impact on agent implementation.\n   A threshold\
    \ notification occurs whenever the corresponding current\n   15-minute interval\
    \ error counter becomes equal to, or exceeds, the\n   threshold value.  Only one\
    \ notification SHOULD be sent per interval\n   per interface.  Since the current\
    \ 15-minute counter is reset to 0\n   every 15 minutes, and if the condition persists,\
    \ the notification may\n   recur as often as every 15 minutes.  For example, to\
    \ get a\n   notification whenever a \"loss of\" event occurs (but at most once\n\
    \   every 15 minutes), set the corresponding threshold to 1.  The agent\n   will\
    \ generate a notification when the event originally occurs.\n   Notifications,\
    \ other than the threshold notifications listed above,\n   SHOULD be rate limited\
    \ (throttled) such that there is at least a\n   1-minute gap between the generation\
    \ of consecutive notifications of\n   the same event.  When notifications are\
    \ rate limited, they are\n   dropped and not queued for sending at a future time.\
    \  This is\n   intended to be a general rate-limiting statement for notifications\n\
    \   that have no explicit rate-limiting assertions in this document\n   otherwise.\n\
    \   Note that the Network Management System, or NMS, may receive a\n   linkDown\
    \ notification as well, if enabled (via ifLinkUpDownTrapEnable\n   [RFC2863]).\
    \  At the beginning of the next 15-minute interval, the\n   counter is reset.\
    \  When the first second goes by and the event\n   occurs, the current interval\
    \ bucket will be 1, which equals the\n   threshold, and the notification will\
    \ be sent again.\n   An hdsl2ShdslSpanInvalidNumRepeaters notification may be\
    \ generated\n   following completion of the discovery phase if the number of\n\
    \   repeaters discovered on the line differs from the number of repeaters\n  \
    \ specified in hdsl2ShdslSpanConfNumRepeaters.  For those conditions\n   where\
    \ the number of provisioned repeaters is greater than those\n   encountered during\
    \ span discovery, all table entries associated with\n   the nonexistent repeaters\
    \ are to be discarded.  For those conditions\n   where the number of provisioned\
    \ repeaters is less than those\n   encountered during span discovery, additional\
    \ table entries are to be\n   created using the default span configuration profile.\n"

  - "5.  Security Considerations\n   There are a number of management objects defined\
    \ in this MIB module\n   with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.\
    \  Such\n   objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network\n\
    \   environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure\n   environment\
    \ without proper protection can have a negative effect on\n   network operations.\
    \  These are the tables and objects and their\n   sensitivity/vulnerability:\n\
    \   o  hdsl2ShdslSpanConfTable\n      The table consists of the following objects\
    \ that support SET\n      operations:\n      *  hdsl2ShdslSpanConfNumRepeaters\n\
    \      *  hdsl2ShdslSpanConfProfile\n      *  hdsl2ShdslSpanConfAlarmProfile\n\
    \      Unauthorized changes to hdsl2ShdslSpanConfNumRepeaters could\n      result\
    \ in an hdsl2ShdslSpanInvalidNumRepeaters notification.  Note\n      the discussion\
    \ on hdsl2ShdslSpanInvalidNumRepeaters in the\n      Notifications section above.\n\
    \      Unauthorized changes to hdsl2ShdslSpanConfProfile could have an\n     \
    \ adverse operational effect on a span.  Reference the\n      hdsl2ShdslSpanConfProfileTable\
    \ discussion below.\n      Unauthorized changes to hdsl2ShdslSpanConfAlarmProfile\
    \ could have\n      a contrary effect on notifications.  Reference the\n     \
    \ hdsl2ShdslEndpointAlarmConfProfileTable discussion below.\n   o  hdsl2ShdslEndpointConfTable\n\
    \      This table contains one object,\n      hdsl2ShdslEndpointAlarmConfProfile,\

    \  *  hdsl2ShdslMaintLoopbackConfig\n      *  hdsl2ShdslMaintPowerBackoff\n  \
    \    *  hdsl2ShdslMaintSoftRestart\n      Unauthorized changes to hdsl2ShdslMaintLoopbackConfig\

    \    loopback.\n      Unauthorized changes to hdsl2ShdslMaintPowerBackoff could\
    \ result\n      in an increased in bundle interference.\n      Unauthorized changes\
    \ to hdsl2ShdslMaintSoftRestart could result in\n      a temporary interruption\
    \ of end-to-end data transfer as the result\n      of the triggering of a soft\
    \ restart.\n   o  hdsl2ShdslUnitMaintTable\n      This table contains one object,\
    \ hdsl2ShdslMaintLoopbackTimeout,\n      that supports SET operations.  An unauthorized\
    \ change to this\n      object could result in the timeout value for loopbacks\
    \ being\n      increased, decreased, or disabled.\n   o  hdsl2ShdslSpanConfProfileTable\n\
    \      The table consists of the following objects that support SET\n      operations:\n\

    \      *  hdsl2ShdslSpanConfProfileRowStatus\n      Setting any of the objects\
    \ to an incorrect value could have an\n      adverse operational effect on a span.\n\
    \      Unauthorized changes to the hdsl2ShdslSpanConfWireInterface could\n   \
    \   result in the failure of a span to achieve activation to a state\n      that\
    \ would permit data flow.  For example, setting this object to\n      six-wire\
    \ or eight-wire operation when one of the units in the span\n      only supports\
    \ two-wire or four-wire operation would likely prevent\n      an expected end-to-end\
    \ data transfer capability.\n      Unauthorized changes to hdsl2ShdslSpanConfMinLineRate\
    \ or\n      hdsl2ShdslSpanConfMaxLineRate could have an adverse effect on\n  \
    \    performance.  The range of allowable line rates could be altered\n      such\
    \ that the span may not be able to train to a line rate that\n      would permit\
    \ any end-user data to traverse the span or the span\n      could train to a line\
    \ rate that is either greater than or less\n      than the line rate that the\
    \ provider has pledged.\n      Unauthorized changes to hdsl2ShdslSpanConfPSD or\n\
    \      hdsl2ShdslSpanConfTransmissionMode could have a detrimental effect\n  \
    \    on loop reach, performance, or spectral compatibility.\n      Unauthorized\
    \ changes to hdsl2ShdslSpanConfRemoteEnable could alter\n      the remote management\
    \ ability of units.\n      Unauthorized changes to hdsl2ShdslSpanConfPowerFeeding\
    \ could\n      shutdown units that are expected to be fed power remotely.\n  \
    \    Changing the configuration such that wetting current is not\n      supplied\
    \ may result in corrosion of electrical contacts.\n      Unauthorized changes\
    \ to\n      hdsl2ShdslSpanConfCurrCondTargetMarginDown,\n      hdsl2ShdslSpanConfWorstCaseTargetMarginDown,\n\
    \      hdsl2ShdslSpanConfCurrCondTargetMarginUp,\n      hdsl2ShdslSpanConfWorstCaseTargetMarginUp,\
    \ or\n      hdsl2ShdslSpanConfUsedTargetMargins could result in invalid\n    \
    \  parameters used to determine if a data rate can be supported under\n      current\
    \ and worst-case noise.\n      Unauthorized changes to hdsl2ShdslSpanConfReferenceClock\
    \ could\n      result in the selection of a clock source that might either\n \
    \     prevent any data from being transferred or impair data transfer.\n     \
    \ In addition, an increase in CRC anomalies may be experienced.\n      Unauthorized\
    \ changes to hdsl2ShdslSpanConfLineProbeEnable could\n      have a negative effect\
    \ on selecting the optimum rate or power\n      level based on current line conditions.\n\
    \      Unauthorized changes to row status could result in unwanted\n      profiles\
    \ being created or brought into service.  Also, changes to\n      the row status\
    \ could result in profiles being inadvertently\n      deleted or taken out of\
    \ service.\n   o  hdsl2ShdslEndpointAlarmConfProfileTable\n      The table consists\
    \ of the following objects that support SET\n      operations:\n      *  hdsl2ShdslEndpointThreshLoopAttenuation\n\
    \      *  hdsl2ShdslEndpointThreshSNRMargin\n      *  hdsl2ShdslEndpointThreshES\n\
    \      *  hdsl2ShdslEndpointThreshSES\n      *  hdsl2ShdslEndpointThreshCRCanomalies\n\
    \      *  hdsl2ShdslEndpointThreshLOSWS\n      *  hdsl2ShdslEndpointThreshUAS\n\
    \      *  hdsl2ShdslEndpointAlarmConfProfileRowStatus\n      Increasing any of\
    \ the threshold values could result in a\n      notification being suppressed\
    \ or deferred.  Setting a threshold to\n      0 could result in a notification\
    \ being suppressed.  Suppressing or\n      deferring a notification could prevent\
    \ the timely delivery of\n      important diagnostic information.  Decreasing\
    \ any of the threshold\n      values could result in a notification being sent\
    \ from the network\n      falsely reporting a threshold crossing.\n      Changing\
    \ a threshold value could also have an impact on the amount\n      of notifications\
    \ the agent sends.  This document adds a paragraph,\n      which was not in RFC\
    \ 3276 [RFC3276], to the Notifications section\n      that provides general guidance\
    \ to the rate limiting of\n      notifications.  Agent implementations not adhering\
    \ to the rate-\n      limiting desires could result in notifications being generated\
    \ at\n      an uncontrolled rate.  Unauthorized changes to a threshold value\n\
    \      could result in an undesired notification rate.\n      Unauthorized changes\
    \ to row status could result in unwanted\n      profiles being created or brought\
    \ into service.  Also, changes to\n      the row status could result in profiles\
    \ being inadvertently\n      deleted or taken out of service.\n   Some of the\
    \ readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a\n   MAX-ACCESS other\
    \ than not-accessible) may be considered sensitive or\n   vulnerable in some network\
    \ environments.  It is thus important to\n   control even GET and/or NOTIFY access\
    \ to these objects and possibly\n   to even encrypt the values of these objects\
    \ when sending them over\n   the network via SNMP.  These are the tables and objects\
    \ and their\n   sensitivity/vulnerability:\n   o  hdsl2ShdslInventoryTable\n \
    \     Access to these objects would allow an intruder to obtain\n      information\
    \ about which vendor's equipment is in use on the\n      network.  Further, such\
    \ information is considered sensitive in\n      many environments for competitive\
    \ reasons.\n      *  hdsl2ShdslInvVendorID\n      *  hdsl2ShdslInvVendorModelNumber\n\
    \      *  hdsl2ShdslInvVendorSerialNumber\n      *  hdsl2ShdslInvVendorEOCSoftwareVersion\n\
    \      *  hdsl2ShdslInvStandardVersion\n      *  hdsl2ShdslInvVendorListNumber\n\
    \      *  hdsl2ShdslInvVendorIssueNumber\n      *  hdsl2ShdslInvVendorSoftwareVersion\n\
    \      *  hdsl2ShdslInvEquipmentCode\n      *  hdsl2ShdslInvVendorOther\n    \
    \  *  hdsl2ShdslInvTransmissionModeCapability\n   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3\
    \ did not include adequate security.\n   Even if the network itself is secure\
    \ (for example by using IPsec),\n   even then, there is no control as to who on\
    \ the secure network is\n   allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete)\
    \ the objects\n   in this MIB module.\n   It is RECOMMENDED that implementers\
    \ consider the security features as\n   provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see\
    \ [RFC3410], Section 8),\n   including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic\
    \ mechanisms (for\n   authentication and privacy).\n   Further, deployment of\
    \ SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT\n   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED\
    \ to deploy SNMPv3 and to\n   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator\n\
    \   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an\n   instance\
    \ of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to\n   the objects\
    \ only to those principals (users) that have legitimate\n   rights to indeed GET\
    \ or SET (change/create/delete) them.\n"
