Abstract This memo defines an SMIv2 MIB module for managing the Rapid Spanning Tree capability defined by the IEEE P802.1t and P802.1w amendments to IEEE Std 802.1D 1998 for bridging between Local Area Network (LAN) segments.
The objects in this MIB are defined to apply both to transparent bridging and to bridges connected by subnetworks other than LAN segments.
The Internet Standard Management Framework
For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current Internet Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of RFC 3410 [RFC3410].
Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed the Management Information Base or MIB.
MIB objects are generally accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the Structure of Management Information (SMI).
This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58, RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58
, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
This memo defines an SMIv2 MIB module for managing the Rapid Spanning Tree (RSTP) capability defined by the IEEE P802.1t [802.1t] and P802.1w [802.1w] amendments to IEEE Std 802.1D 1998 [802.1D 1998] for bridging between Local Area Network (LAN) segments.
The objects in this MIB are defined to apply both to transparent bridging and to bridges connected by subnetworks other than LAN segments.
Relationship to IEEE 802.1t and 802.1w Amendments
This document defines managed objects for the Rapid Spanning Tree Protocol defined by the IEEE P802.1t and IEEE P802.1w amendments to 802.1D 1998.
There are concerns that there may be changes made in the 802.1D 2004 edition that would lead to non backward compatible SMI changes for 802.1t and 802.1w managed objects in the MIB modules.
The Bridge MIB working group decided to 'freeze' the technical content of the MIB modules at a level that is compatible with the 802.1t and 802.1w versions, and leave to the IEEE 802.1 working group any updates beyond this.
For informational purposes only, these are the references for the above objects in 802.1D 2004
The objects in the RSTP MIB supplement those defined in the Bridge MIB [RFC4188].
The Original BRIDGE MIB [RFC1493] has been updated in an SMIv2  compliant version [RFC4188].
Conformance statements have been added and some description and reference clauses have been updated.
The interpretations of some objects were changed to accommodate IEEE 802.1t and 802.1w amendments.
The object dot1dStpPortPathCost32 was added to support IEEE 802.1t, and the permissible values of dot1dStpPriority and dot1dStpPortPriority have been clarified for bridges supporting IEEE
The interpretation of dot1dStpTimeSinceTopologyChange has been clarified for bridges supporting the RSTP.
See the updated BRIDGE MIB [RFC4188] for details.

" DESCRIPTION "The Bridge MIB Extension module for managing devices that support the Rapid Spanning Tree Protocol defined by IEEE 802.1w.
This version of this MIB module is part of RFC 4318; See the RFC itself for full legal notices."
The initial version of this MIB module as published in RFC 4318."
"The version of Spanning Tree Protocol the bridge is currently running.
The value 'stpCompatible(0)' indicates the Spanning Tree Protocol specified in IEEE 802.1D 1998 and 'rstp(2)'
indicates the Rapid Spanning Tree Protocol specified in IEEE 802.1w and clause 17 of 802.1D 2004.
The values are directly from the IEEE standard.
New values may be defined as future versions of the protocol become available.
The value of this object MUST be retained across reinitializations of the management system."
"The value used by the Port Transmit state machine to limit the maximum transmission rate.
The value of this object MUST be retained across reinitializations of the management system."
REFERENCE "IEEE 802.1w clause 17.16.6
It has since been   obsoleted, and should not be used.
A table that contains port specific Rapid Spanning Tree information."
A list of Rapid Spanning Tree information maintained by each port."
When operating in RSTP (version 2) mode, writing true(1) to this object forces this port to transmit RSTP BPDUs.
Any other operation on this object has no effect and it always returns false(2) when read.
clause 14.8.2.4, 17.18.10, 17.26" ::
{ dot1dStpExtPortEntry 1 } dot1dStpPortAdminEdgePort OBJECT TYPE SYNTAX
"The administrative value of the Edge Port parameter.
A value of true(1) indicates that this port should be assumed as an edge port, and a value of false(2) indicates that this port should be assumed as a non edge port.
Setting this object will also cause the corresponding instance of dot1dStpPortOperEdgePort to change to the same value.
Note that even when this object's value is true, the value of the corresponding instance of dot1dStpPortOperEdgePort can be false if a BPDU has been received.
The value of this object MUST be retained across reinitializations of the management system.
" REFERENCE "IEEE 802.1t clause 14.8.2, 18.3.3" ::
{ dot1dStpExtPortEntry 2 } dot1dStpPortOperEdgePort OBJECT
The operational value of the Edge Port parameter.
The object is initialized to the value of the corresponding instance of dot1dStpPortAdminEdgePort.
When the corresponding instance of dot1dStpPortAdminEdgePort is set, this object will be changed as well.
This object will also be changed to false on reception of a BPDU.
REFERENCE "IEEE 802.1t clause 14.8.2, 18.3.4" ::
{ dot1dStpExtPortEntry 3 } dot1dStpPortAdminPointToPoint OBJECT TYPE
"The administrative point to point status of the LAN segment attached to this port, using the enumeration values of the IEEE 802.1w clause.
A value of forceTrue(0) indicates that this port should always be treated as if it is connected to a point to point link.
A value of forceFalse(1) indicates that this port should be treated as having a shared media connection.
A value of auto(2) indicates that this port is considered to have a point to point link if it is an Aggregator and all of its members are aggregatable, or if the MAC entity is configured for full duplex operation, either through auto negotiation or by management means.
this object changes the underlying adminPortToPortMAC.
The value of this object MUST be retained across reinitializations of the management system."
"The operational point to point status of the LAN segment attached to this port.
It indicates whether a port is considered to have a point to point connection.
If adminPointToPointMAC is set to auto(2), then the value of operPointToPointMAC is determined in accordance with the specific procedures defined for the MAC entity concerned, as defined in IEEE 802.1w, clause 6.5.
The value is determined dynamically; that is, it is re evaluated whenever the value of adminPointToPointMAC changes, and whenever the specific procedures defined for the MAC entity evaluate a change in its point to point status.
MAX ACCESS  read write STATUS
The administratively assigned value for the contribution of this port to the path cost of paths toward the spanning tree root.
Writing a value of '0' assigns the automatically calculated default Path Cost value to the port.
If the default Path Cost is being used, this object returns '0' when read.
This complements the object dot1dStpPortPathCost or dot1dStpPortPathCost32, which returns the operational value of the path cost.
The value of this object MUST be retained across reinitializations of the management system.
"The compliance statement for device support of Rapid Spanning Tree Protocol (RSTP) bridging services."
The IANA has assigned the following OID:
There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB module with a MAX ACCESS clause of read write and/or read create.
Such objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.
The support for SET operations in a non secure environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on network operations.
These are the tables and objects and their sensitivity/vulnerability: Writable objects that could be misused to cause network delays and spanning tree instabilities include dot1dStpVersion, dot1dStpTxHoldCount, dot1dStpPortProtocolMigration, dot1dStpPortAdminEdgePort, and dot1dStpPortAdminPathCost.
Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a MAX ACCESS other than not accessible) may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.
It is thus important to control
even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over the network via SNMP.
These are the tables and objects and their sensitivity/vulnerability: dot1dStpVersion could be read by an attacker to identify environments containing applications or protocols that are potentially sensitive to RSTP mode.
dot1dStpPortAdminPointToPoint could be used to mislead an access control protocol, such as 802.1x, to believe that only one other system is attached to a LAN segment and to enable network access based on that assumption.
This situation could permit potential man in the middle attacks.
SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPsec), even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is allowed to access and
the objects in this MIB module.
It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8), including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for authentication and privacy).
Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT RECOMMENDED.
Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to enable cryptographic security.
It is then a customer/operator responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate rights to indeed GET or SET
