  - "1.  Introduction\n   PASSporT [RFC8225] is a token format based on JSON Web Token\
    \ (JWT)\n   [RFC7519] for conveying cryptographically signed information about\n\
    \   the identities involved in personal communications.  PASSporT with\n   Secure\
    \ Telephone Identity Revisited (STIR) [RFC8224] provides a\n   mechanism by which\
    \ an authority on the originating side of a call,\n   using a protocol like SIP\
    \ [RFC3261], can provide a cryptographic\n   assurance of the validity of the\
    \ calling party telephone number in\n   order to prevent impersonation attacks.\n\
    \   [RFC4412] defines a mechanism to prioritize access to SIP-signaled\n   resources\
    \ during periods of communications resource scarcity using\n   the SIP 'Resource-Priority'\
    \ header.  As specified in [RFC4412], the\n   SIP 'Resource-Priority' header field\
    \ may be used by SIP user agents\n   (UAs) [RFC3261] (including Public Switched\
    \ Telephone Network (PSTN)\n   gateways and SIP proxy servers) to influence prioritization\
    \ afforded\n   to communication sessions, including PSTN calls (e.g., to manage\n\
    \   scarce network resources during network congestion scenarios).\n   However,\
    \ the SIP 'Resource-Priority' header field could be spoofed\n   and abused by\
    \ unauthorized entities, the threat models and use cases\n   of which are described\
    \ in [RFC7375] and [RFC7340], respectively.\n   Compromise of the SIP 'Resource-Priority'\
    \ header field [RFC4412]\n   could lead to misuse of network resources (i.e.,\
    \ during congestion\n   scenarios), impacting the application services supported\
    \ using the\n   SIP 'Resource-Priority' header field.\n   [RFC8225] allows extensions\
    \ by which an authority on the originating\n   side verifying the authorization\
    \ of a particular communication for\n   the SIP 'Resource-Priority' header field\
    \ can use a PASSPorT claim to\n   cryptographically sign the SIP 'Resource-Priority'\
    \ header field and\n   convey assertion of the authorization for the SIP 'Resource-Priority'\n\
    \   header field.  A signed SIP 'Resource-Priority' header field will\n   allow\
    \ a receiving entity (including entities located in different\n   network domains/boundaries)\
    \ to verify the validity of assertions\n   authorizing the SIP 'Resource-Priority'\
    \ header field and to act on\n   the information with confidence that the information\
    \ has not been\n   spoofed or compromised.\n   This specification documents an\
    \ extension to PASSporT and the\n   associated STIR mechanisms to provide a function\
    \ to cryptographically\n   sign the SIP 'Resource-Priority' header field.  This\
    \ PASSporT object\n   is used to provide attestation of a calling-user authorization\
    \ for\n   priority communications.  This is necessary in addition to the\n   PASSporT\
    \ object that is used for calling-user telephone-number\n   attestation.  How\
    \ this extension to PASSporT is used for real-time\n   communications supported\
    \ using the SIP 'Resource-Priority' header\n   field is outside the scope of this\
    \ document.  In addition, the\n   PASSPorT extension defined in this document\
    \ is intended for use in\n   environments where there are means to verify that\
    \ the signer of the\n   SIP 'Resource-Priority' header field is authoritative.\n"

- title: 3.  PASSporT "rph" Claim
  contents:
  - "3.  PASSporT \"rph\" Claim\n   This specification defines a new JSON Web Token\
    \ claim for \"rph\" that\n   provides an assertion for information in the SIP\
    \ 'Resource-Priority'\n   header field.\n   The creator of a PASSporT object adds\
    \ a \"ppt\" value of \"rph\" to the\n   header of a PASSporT object.  The PASSporT\
    \ claims MUST contain an\n   \"rph\" claim, and any entities verifying the PASSporT\
    \ object will be\n   required to understand the \"ppt\" extension in order to\
    \ process the\n   PASSporT in question.  A PASSPorT header with the \"ppt\" included\
    \ will\n   look as follows:\n   {\n   \"typ\":\"passport\",\n     \"ppt\":\"rph\"\
    ,\n     \"alg\":\"ES256\",\n     \"x5u\":\"https://www.example.org/cert.cer\"\n\
    \   }\n   The \"rph\" claim will provide an assertion of authorization, \"auth\"\
    ,\n   for information in the SIP 'Resource-Priority' header field based on\n \
    \  [RFC4412].  The syntax is:\n   {\n   Resource-Priority = \"Resource-Priority\"\
    \ : r-value,\n   r-value = namespace  \".\"  r-priority\n   }\n   Specifically,\
    \ the \"rph\" claim includes an assertion of the priority\n   level of the user\
    \ to be used for a given communication session.  The\n   value of the \"rph\"\
    \ claim is an object with one or more keys.  Each\n   key is associated with a\
    \ JSON array.  These arrays contain strings\n   that correspond to the r-values\
    \ indicated in the SIP 'Resource-\n   Priority' header field.\n   The following\
    \ is an example \"rph\" claim for a SIP 'Resource-Priority'\n   header field with\
    \ one r-value of \"ets.0\" and with another r-value of\n   \"wps.0\":\n    {\n\
    \     \"orig\":{\"tn\":\"12155550112\"},\n     \"dest\":{[\"tn\":\"12125550113\"\
    ]},\n     \"iat\":1443208345,\n     \"rph\":{\"auth\":[\"ets.0\", \"wps.0\"]}\n\
    \    }\n   After the header and claims PASSporT objects have been constructed,\n\
    \   their signature is generated normally per the guidance in [RFC8225]\n   using\
    \ the full form of PASSPorT.  The credentials (i.e., Certificate)\n   used to\
    \ create the signature must have authority over the namespace\n   of the \"rph\"\
    \ claim, and there is only one authority per claim.  The\n   authority MUST use\
    \ its credentials associated with the specific\n   service supported by the resource\
    \ priority namespace in the claim.\n   If r-values are added or dropped by the\
    \ intermediaries along the\n   path, the intermediaries must generate a new \"\
    rph\" header and sign\n   the claim with their own authority.\n   The use of the\
    \ compact form of PASSporT is not specified in this\n   document.\n"

    \ that are based on\n   [RFC4412].  The construction of the \"rph\" claim follows\
    \ the steps\n   described in Section 4.1 of [RFC8224].\n   The resulting Identity\
    \ header for \"rph\" might look as follows\n   (backslashes shown for line folding\

    \ org/cert.cer>;alg=ES256;ppt=\"rph\"\n   A SIP authentication service will derive\
    \ the value of \"rph\" from the\n   SIP 'Resource-Priority' header field based\
    \ on policy associated with\n   service-specific use of r-values, defined as follows\
    \ in [RFC4412]:\n      r-value = namespace \".\" r-priority\n   The authentication\
    \ service derives the value of the PASSPorT claim by\n   verifying the authorization\
    \ for the SIP 'Resource-Priority' header\n   field (i.e., verifying a calling-user\
    \ privilege for the SIP\n   'Resource-Priority' header field based on its identity).\
    \  The\n   authorization might be derived from customer-profile data or access\n\
    \   to external services.\n   [RFC4412] allows multiple \"namespace \".\" priority\
    \ value\" pairs,\n   either in a single SIP 'Resource-Priority' header field or\
    \ across\n   multiple SIP 'Resource-Priority' header fields.  An authority is\n\
    \   responsible for signing all the content of a SIP 'Resource-Priority'\n   header\
    \ field for which it has the authority.\n"
- title: 4.2.  Verification Service Behavior
  contents:
  - "4.2.  Verification Service Behavior\n   [RFC8224], Section 6.2, Step 5 requires\
    \ that specifications defining\n   \"ppt\" values describe any additional verifier\
    \ behavior.  The behavior\n   specified for the \"ppt\" values of \"rph\" is as\
    \ follows:\n   The verification service MUST extract the value associated with\
    \ the\n   \"auth\" key in a full-form PASSPorT with a \"ppt\" value of \"rph\"\
    .  If\n   the signature validates, then the verification service can use the\n\
    \   value of the \"rph\" claim as validation that the calling party is\n   authorized\
    \ for SIP 'Resource-Priority' header fields as indicated in\n   the claim.  This\
    \ value would, in turn, be used for priority treatment\n   in accordance with\
    \ local policy for the associated communication\n   service.  If the signature\
    \ validation fails, the verification service\n   should infer that the calling\
    \ party is not authorized for SIP\n   'Resource-Priority' header fields as indicated\
    \ in the claim.  In such\n   cases, the priority treatment for the associated\
    \ communication\n   service is handled as per the local policy of the verifier.\
    \  In such\n   scenarios, the SIP 'Resource-Priority' header field SHOULD be\n\
    \   stripped from the SIP request, and the network entities should treat\n   the\
    \ call as an ordinary call.\n   In addition, [RFC8224], Section 6.2, Step 4 requires\
    \ the \"iat\" value\n   in \"rph\" claim to be verified.\n   The behavior of a\
    \ SIP UA upon receiving an INVITE containing a\n   PASSporT object with an \"\
    rph\" claim will largely remain a matter of\n   implementation policy for the\
    \ specific communication service.  In\n   most cases, implementations would act\
    \ based on confidence in the\n   veracity of this information.\n"
