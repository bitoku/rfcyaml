- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   The Dynamic Link Exchange Protocol (DLEP) is a protocol\
    \ for modems to\n   advertise the status of wireless links between reachable destinations\n\
    \   to attached routers.  The core specification of the protocol\n   [RFC8175]\
    \ assumes that every modem in the radio network has an\n   attached DLEP router\
    \ and requires that the MAC address of the DLEP\n   interface on the attached\
    \ router be used to identify the destination\n   in the network, for purposes\
    \ of reporting the state and quality of\n   the link to that destination.\n  \
    \ This document describes a DLEP extension that allows modems that do\n   not\
    \ meet the strict requirement above to use DLEP to describe link\n   availability\
    \ and quality to one or more destinations reachable beyond\n   a device on the\
    \ Layer 2 domain.\n   As with core DLEP [RFC8175], a router can use this knowledge\
    \ to\n   influence any routing or flow-control decisions regarding traffic to\n\
    \   this destination, understanding that such traffic flows via Layer 3.\n"
- title: 1.1.  Terminology
  contents:
  - "1.1.  Terminology\n   Local Layer 2 domain:  The Layer 2 domain that links the\
    \ router and\n      modem participants of the current DLEP session.\n   Layer\
    \ 3 DLEP Destination:  A DLEP Destination that is not directly\n      addressable\
    \ within the local Layer 2 domain but is reachable via a\n      node addressable\
    \ within the local Layer 2 domain.\n   Gateway Node:  The last device with a MAC\
    \ address reachable in the\n      local Layer 2 domain on the path from the DLEP\
    \ router participant\n      towards the Layer 3 DLEP Destination.  This device\
    \ is commonly the\n      DLEP peer modem but could be another DLEP Destination\
    \ in the Layer\n      2 domain.\n"
- title: 1.2.  Applicability
  contents:
  - "1.2.  Applicability\n   This extension was designed primarily to address the\
    \ following use\n   cases:\n   1.  A radio system that does not operate in Layer\
    \ 2 bridge mode but\n       instead provides Layer 3 connectivity between destinations,\
    \ often\n       using its own embedded Layer 3 routing function.\n   2.  A point-to-multipoint\
    \ tunnel system, such as a software-defined\n       wide-area network (SD-WAN)\
    \ deployment, where the tunnel provider\n       acts as a modem that has knowledge\
    \ of the characteristics of the\n       underlay network and provides that information\
    \ as availability\n       and metrics between tunnel endpoints in the overlay\
    \ network.\n   3.  A modem that provides connectivity to a remote wide-area network\n\
    \       via a wireless link, but the concept of a Layer 2 reachable\n       remote\
    \ router does not apply.  An example of such a modem would\n       be an LTE device\
    \ or 802.11 station that provides variable\n       connectivity to the Internet.\n\
    \   This list of use cases is not exhaustive, and this extension may well\n  \
    \ be applicable to future, currently unforeseen, use cases.\n"

    \ in all\n   capitals, as shown here.\n"
- title: 2.  Operation
  contents:
  - "2.  Operation\n   To refer to a Layer 3 DLEP Destination, the DLEP session participant\n\
    \   adds a Link Identifier Data Item (Section 3.2) to the relevant\n   Destination\
    \ Message and (as usual) includes a MAC Address Data Item.\n   When paired with\
    \ a Link Identifier Data Item, the MAC Address Data\n   Item MUST contain the\
    \ MAC address of the Gateway Node.\n   As only modems are initially aware of Layer\
    \ 3 DLEP Destinations, Link\n   Identifier Data Items referring to a new link\
    \ MUST first appear in a\n   DLEP Destination Up Message from the modem to the\
    \ router.  Once a\n   link has been identified in this way, Link Identifier Data\
    \ Items may\n   be used by either DLEP participant during the lifetime of a DLEP\n\
    \   session.  Because of this, a router MUST NOT send a DLEP Destination\n   Announce\
    \ Message containing a Link Identifier Data Item referring to\n   a link that\
    \ has not been mentioned in a prior DLEP Destination Up\n   Message.  If a modem\
    \ receives such a message, it MUST terminate the\n   session by issuing a Session\
    \ Termination Message containing a Status\n   Data Item with status code set to\
    \ 131 ('Invalid Destination') and\n   transition to the Session Termination state.\
    \  If a router receives a\n   Destination Up Message specifying a Link Identifier\
    \ that has already\n   been used, the router MUST respond with a Destination Up\
    \ Response\n   Message containing a Status Data Item with status code set to 130\n\
    \   ('Invalid Data') and transition to the Session Termination state.\n   Because\
    \ the MAC address associated with any DLEP Destination Message\n   containing\
    \ a Link Identifier Data Item is not the Layer 2 address of\n   the final destination,\
    \ all DLEP Destination Up Messages containing a\n   Link Identifier Data Item\
    \ MUST contain Layer 3 information.  In the\n   case of modems that provide Layer\
    \ 3 wide area network connectivity\n   between devices, this means one or more\
    \ IPv4 or IPv6 Address Data\n   Items providing the Layer 3 address of the final\
    \ destination.  When\n   referring to some upstream backbone network infrastructures,\
    \ this\n   means one or more IPv4 or IPv6 Attached Subnet Data Items, for\n  \
    \ example: '0.0.0.0/0' or '::/0'.  This mechanism allows the DLEP peer\n   router\
    \ to understand the properties of the link to those routes.  The\n   address or\
    \ addresses in the IPv4 or IPv6 Address Data Items MUST be\n   the addresses in\
    \ use on the public side of any Network Address\n   Translation.\n   When the\
    \ DLEP peer router wishes to route packets to the Layer 3 DLEP\n   Destination,\
    \ the MAC address associated with the Gateway Node MUST be\n   used as the Layer\
    \ 2 destination of the packet if it wishes to use the\n   modem network to forward\
    \ the packet.\n   As routers populate their Routing Information Base with the\
    \ IP\n   address of the next-hop router towards a destination, implementations\n\
    \   supporting this extension SHOULD announce at least one valid IPv4 or\n   IPv6\
    \ addresses of the Gateway Node; this removes the need for the\n   router to use\
    \ an additional IP address resolution protocol before\n   adding the route to\
    \ its Routing Information Base.\n"
- title: 2.1.  Identifier Restrictions
  contents:
  - "2.1.  Identifier Restrictions\n   A Link Identifier is, by default, 4 octets\
    \ in length.  If a modem\n   wishes to use a Link Identifier of a different length,\
    \ it MUST be\n   announced using the Link Identifier Length Data Item (Section\
    \ 3.1)\n   contained in the DLEP Session Initialization Response Message sent\
    \ by\n   the modem to the router.\n   During the lifetime of a DLEP session, the\
    \ length of Link Identifiers\n   MUST remain constant, i.e., the Length field\
    \ of the Link Identifier\n   Data Item MUST NOT differ between destinations.\n\
    \   The method for generating Link Identifiers is a modem implementation\n   matter\
    \ and out of scope of this document.  Routers must not make any\n   assumptions\
    \ about the meaning of Link Identifiers or how Link\n   Identifiers are generated.\n\
    \   Within a single DLEP session, all Link Identifiers MUST be unique per\n  \
    \ MAC address.  This means that a Layer 3 DLEP Destination is uniquely\n   identified\
    \ by the pair: {MAC Address,Link Identifier}.\n   Link Identifiers MUST NOT be\
    \ reused, i.e., a {MAC Address,Link\n   Identifier} pair that has been used to\
    \ refer to one Layer 3 DLEP\n   Destination MUST NOT be used again within the\
    \ lifetime of a single\n   DLEP peer-to-peer session.\n"
- title: 2.2.  Negotiation
  contents:
  - "2.2.  Negotiation\n   To use this extension, as with all DLEP extensions, the\
    \ extension\n   MUST be announced during DLEP session initialization.  A router\n\
    \   advertises support by including the value 3 ('Link Identifiers')\n   (Section\
    \ 5), in the Extension Data Item within the Session\n   Initialization Message.\
    \  A modem advertises support by including the\n   value 3 ('Link Identifiers')\
    \ in the Extension Data Item within the\n   Session Initialization Response Message.\
    \  If both DLEP peers\n   advertise support for this extension, then Link Identifier\
    \ Data Items\n   can be included in DLEP Messages.\n   If a modem requires support\
    \ for this extension in order to describe\n   destinations and the router does\
    \ not advertise support, then the\n   modem MUST NOT include a Link Identifier\
    \ Data Item in any DLEP\n   Message.  However, the modem SHOULD NOT immediately\
    \ terminate the\n   DLEP session; rather, it SHOULD use a combination of DLEP\
    \ Session\n   Messages and DLEP Attached Subnet Data Items to provide general\n\
    \   information.\n"
- title: 3.  New Data Items
  contents:
  - "3.  New Data Items\n   This extension introduces two new DLEP Data Items: 1)\
    \ the Link\n   Identifier Length Data Item (Section 3.1) used to announce the\
    \ length\n   of Link Identifiers at session initialization and 2) the Link\n \
    \  Identifier Data Item (Section 3.2) used to identify a Layer 3 link at\n   or\
    \ beyond a destination.\n"

    \   Identifiers') in the Extension Data Item inside the Session\n   Initialization\
    \ Message, this Data Item MAY be used in the Session\n   Initialization Response\
