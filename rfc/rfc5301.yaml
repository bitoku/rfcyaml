  - "Abstract\n   RFC 2763 defined a simple and dynamic mechanism for routers running\n\
    \   IS-IS to learn about symbolic hostnames.  RFC 2763 defined a new TLV\n   that\
    \ allows the IS-IS routers to flood their name-to-systemID mapping\n   information\
    \ across the IS-IS network.\n   This document obsoletes RFC 2763.  This document\
    \ moves the capability\n   provided by RFC 2763 to the Standards Track.\n"

  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   IS-IS uses a variable 1-8 byte system ID (normally 6 bytes)\
    \ to\n   represent a node in the network.  For management and operation\n   reasons,\
    \ network operators need to check the status of IS-IS\n   adjacencies, entries\
    \ in the routing table, and the content of the\n   IS-IS link state database.\
    \  It is obvious that, when looking at\n   diagnostics information, hexadecimal\
    \ representations of system IDs\n   and Link State Protocol Data Unit (LSP) identifiers\
    \ are less clear\n   than symbolic names.\n   One way to overcome this problem\
    \ is to define a name-to-systemID\n   mapping on a router.  This mapping can be\
    \ used bidirectionally, e.g.,\n   to find symbolic names for system IDs and to\
    \ find system IDs for\n   symbolic names.  One way to build this table of mappings\
    \ is by static\n   definitions.  Among network administrators who use IS-IS as\
    \ their\n   IGP, it is current practice to define such static mappings.\n   Thus,\
    \ every router has to maintain a statically-configured table with\n   mappings\
    \ between router names and system IDs.  These tables need to\n   contain the names\
    \ and system IDs of all routers in the network, and\n   must be modified each\
    \ time an addition, deletion, or change occurs.\n   There are several ways one\
    \ could build such a table.  One is via\n   static configurations.  Another scheme\
    \ that could be implemented is\n   via DNS lookups.  In this document, we provide\
    \ a third solution,\n   which in wide-scale implementation and deployment has\
    \ proven to be\n   easier and more manageable than static mapping or DNS schemes.\n"

  - "1.1.  Specification of Requirements\n   The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\"\
    , \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\"\
    , \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n   document are to be interpreted as described\
    \ in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].\n"
- title: 2.  Possible Solutions
  contents:
  - "2.  Possible Solutions\n   The obvious drawback of static configuration of mappings\
    \ is the issue\n   of scalability and maintainability.  The network operators\
    \ have to\n   maintain the name tables.  They have to maintain an entry in the\n\
    \   table for every router in the network, on every router in the\n   network.\
    \  The effort to create and maintain these static tables grows\n   with the total\
    \ number of routers on the network.  Changing the name\n   or system ID of one\
    \ router, or adding a new router will affect the\n   configurations of all the\
    \ other routers on the network.  This will\n   make it very likely that those\
    \ static tables are outdated.\n   Having one table that can be updated in a centralized\
    \ place would be\n   helpful.  One could imagine using the DNS system for this.\
    \  A\n   drawback is that during the time of network problems, the response\n\
    \   time of DNS services might not be satisfactory or the DNS services\n   might\
    \ not even be available.  Another possible drawback might be the\n   added complexity\
    \ of DNS.  Also, some DNS implementations might not\n   support A and PTR records\
    \ for Connection Network Service (CLNS)\n   Network Service Access Points (NSAPs).\n\
    \   A third way to build dynamic mappings would be to use the transport\n   mechanism\
    \ of the routing protocol itself to advertise symbolic names\n   in IS-IS link-state\
    \ PDUs.  This document defines a new TLV that\n   allows the IS-IS routers to\
    \ include the name-to-systemID mapping data\n   in their LSPs.  This will allow\
    \ simple and reliable transport of name\n   mapping information across the IS-IS\
    \ network.\n"
- title: 3.  Dynamic Hostname TLV
  contents:
  - "3.  Dynamic Hostname TLV\n   The Dynamic hostname TLV is defined here as TLV\
    \ type 137.\n         Length - total length of the value field.\n         Value\
    \ - a string of 1 to 255 bytes.\n   The Dynamic hostname TLV is optional.  This\
    \ TLV may be present in any\n   fragment of a non-pseudonode LSP.  The value field\
    \ identifies the\n   symbolic name of the router originating the LSP.  This symbolic\
    \ name\n   can be the FQDN for the router, it can be a subset of the FQDN, or\
    \ it\n   can be any string operators want to use for the router.  The use of\n\
    \   FQDN or a subset of it is strongly recommended.  The content of this\n   value\
    \ is a domain name, see [RFC2181].  The string is not null-\n   terminated.  The\
    \ system ID of this router can be derived from the LSP\n   identifier.\n   If\
    \ this TLV is present in a pseudonode LSP, then it SHOULD NOT be\n   interpreted\
    \ as the DNS hostname of the router.\n   The Value field is encoded in 7-bit ASCII.\
    \  If a user-interface for\n   configuring or displaying this field permits Unicode\
    \ characters, that\n   user-interface is responsible for applying the ToASCII\
    \ and/or\n   ToUnicode algorithm as described in [RFC3490] to achieve the correct\n\
    \   format for transmission or display.\n"
- title: 4.  Implementation
  contents:
  - "4.  Implementation\n   The Dynamic hostname TLV is optional.  When originating\
    \ an LSP, a\n   router may decide to include this TLV in its LSP.  Upon receipt\
    \ of an\n   LSP with the Dynamic hostname TLV, a router may decide to ignore this\n\
    \   TLV, or to install the symbolic name and system ID in its hostname\n   mapping\
    \ table for the IS-IS network.\n   A router may also optionally insert this TLV\
    \ in its pseudonode LSP\n   for the association of a symbolic name to a local\
    \ LAN.\n   If a system receives a mapping for a name or system ID that is\n  \
    \ different from the mapping in the local cache, an implementation\n   SHOULD\
    \ replace the existing mapping with the latest information.\n"
- title: 5.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "5.  Security Considerations\n   Since the name-to-systemID mapping relies on\
    \ information provided by\n   the routers themselves, a misconfigured or compromised\
    \ router can\n   inject false mapping information.  Thus, this information needs\
    \ to be\n   treated with suspicion when, for example, doing diagnostics about\
    \ a\n   suspected security incident.\n   This document raises no other new security\
    \ issues for IS-IS.\n   Security issues with IS-IS are discussed in [RFC5304].\n"
