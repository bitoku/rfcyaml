  - "Abstract\n   This document specifies a mechanism to signal Pseudowire (PW) status\n\
    \   messages using a PW associated channel (ACh).  Such a mechanism is\n   suitable\
    \ for use where no PW dynamic control plane exits, known as\n   static PWs, or\
    \ where a Terminating Provider Edge (T-PE) needs to send\n   a PW status message\
    \ directly to a far-end T-PE.  The mechanism allows\n   PW Operations, Administration,\
    \ and Maintenance (OAM) message mapping\n   and PW redundancy to operate on static\
    \ PWs.  This document also\n   updates RFC 5885 in the case when Bi-directional\
    \ Forwarding Detection\n   (BFD) is used to convey PW status-signaling information.\n"

  - "1.  Introduction\n   The default control plane for Pseudowire (PW) technology,\
    \ as defined\n   in [RFC4447], is based on the Label Distribution Protocol (LDP).\n\
    \   However, that document also describes a static provisioning mode\n   without\
    \ a control plane.  When a static PW is used, there is no\n   method to transmit\
    \ the status of the PW or attachment circuit (AC)\n   between the two Provider\
    \ Edge (PE) devices at each end of the PW.\n   This document defines a method\
    \ to transport the PW status codes\n   defined in Section 5.4.2 of [RFC4447] and\
    \ elsewhere [REDUNDANCY] in-\n   band with the PW data using a generic associated\
    \ channel [RFC5586].\n"

  contents:
  - "4.  Applicability\n   As described in [RFC4447] and [RFC6310], a PE that establishes\
    \ an\n   MPLS PW using means other than LDP, e.g., by static configuration,\n\
    \   MUST support some alternative method of status reporting.  The\n   procedures\
    \ described in this document are for use when PWs are\n   statically configured\
    \ and an LDP control plane is not available.\n   As defined in [RFC4447], a PE\
    \ that establishes a PW using LDP MUST\n   use the PW status TLV mechanism for\
    \ AC and PW status and defect\n   notification on that PW.  In order to avoid\
    \ duplicate notifications\n   and potentially conflicting notifications, such\
    \ PEs MUST NOT use the\n   mechanisms described in this document for those PWs,\
    \ except that the\n   S-PE bypass mode described in Section 5.5 MAY be used when\
    \ both T-PEs\n   at each end of the PW use LDP to establish the PW.\n   In order\
    \ to protect against duplicate notifications and potentially\n   conflicting notifications,\
    \ when the Pseudowire Status protocol for\n   Static Pseudowires described in\
    \ this document is used, the BFD VCCV\n   (Virtual Circuit Connectivity Verification)\
    \ status-signaling\n   mechanisms described in [RFC5885] (CV Types 0x08 and 0x20)\
    \ MUST NOT\n   be used.  BFD VCCV for fault detection (CV types 0x04 and 0x10)\
    \ MAY\n   still be used.\n"

- title: 5.3.  PW OAM Status Message Transmit and Receive
  contents:
  - "5.3.  PW OAM Status Message Transmit and Receive\n   Unlike the PW status procedures\
    \ defined in [RFC4447], with this\n   method there is no TCP/IP session or session\
    \ management.  Therefore,\n   unlike the TCP/IP case, where each message is sent\
    \ only once, the PW\n   OAM message containing the PW status TLV needs to be transmitted\n\
    \   repeatedly to ensure reliable message delivery.  If a malformed TLV\n   or\
    \ an unknown TLV is received in a PW OAM status message, the TLV\n   MUST be ignored,\
    \ and the PE SHOULD report the event to the operator.\n   A PW OAM message containing\
    \ a PW status TLV with a new status bit set\n   or reset will be transmitted immediately\
    \ by the PE.  Unless the\n   message is acknowledged within a second, the PW OAM\
    \ message will then\n   be repeated twice more at an initial interval of one second.\n\
    \   Subsequently, the PW OAM message will be transmitted with an interval\n  \
    \ specified by the refresh timer value in the packet.  Note that this\n   value\
    \ MAY be updated in the new PW OAM message packet, in which case\n   the new refresh\
    \ timer value becomes the new packet transmit interval.\n   The suggested default\
    \ value for the refresh timer is 600 seconds.\n   This default is adequate for\
    \ typical deployments, and PEs are\n   designed to take into account processing\
    \ these messages at the\n   required rate.\n   When a PW OAM message containing\
    \ a status TLV is received, a timer is\n   started according to the refresh rate\
    \ specified in the packet.  If\n   another non-zero PW status message is not received\
    \ within 3.5 times\n   the specified timer value, the status condition will timeout\
    \ in 3.5\n   times the last refresh timer value received, and the default status\n\
    \   of zero is assumed on the PW.  It is also a good practice to\n   introduce\
    \ some jitter in the delay between refresh transmissions, as\n   long as the maximum\
    \ jitter delay is within the prescribed maximum\n   refresh time of 3.5 times\
    \ the specified timer value for 3 consecutive\n   refresh packets.\n   To clear\
    \ a particular status fault, the PE need only send an updated\n   message with\
    \ the corresponding bit cleared.  If the PW status code is\n   zero, the PW OAM\
    \ message will be sent like any other PW OAM status\n   message using the procedures\
    \ described above; however, transmission\n   will cease after 3 PW status messages\
    \ have been sent at one second\n   intervals and before the refresh timer expires.\
    \  A PW status message\n   of zero MAY be acknowledged using the procedures described\
    \ in Section\n   5.3.1.  If it is acknowledged, then a timer value of zero MUST\
    \ be\n   used.  This SHOULD cause the PE sending the PW status notification\n\
    \   message with a PW status code equal to zero to stop sending and to\n   continue\
    \ normal operation.\n"
- title: 5.3.1.  Acknowledgment of PW Status
  contents:
  - "5.3.1.  Acknowledgment of PW Status\n   A PE receiving a PW OAM message containing\
    \ a PW status message MAY\n   acknowledge the PW status message by simply building\
    \ a reply packet\n   with the same format and status code as the received PW OAM\
    \ message,\n   but with the A bit set, and transmitting it on the PW ACh back\
    \ to the\n   source of the PW OAM message.  The receiving PE MAY use the refresh\n\
    \   timer field in the acknowledgement packet to request a new refresh\n   interval\
    \ from the originator of the PW OAM message.  The timer value\n   set in the reply\
    \ packet SHOULD then be used by the originator of the\n   PW OAM message as the\
    \ new transmit interval.  If the requested\n   refresh timer value is to be used,\
    \ then, when the the current timer\n   expires, the PW OAM message transmission\
    \ interval is set to the new\n   value and the new value is sent in the PW OAM\
    \ message.  If the\n   transmitting PE does not want to use the new timer value\
    \ (for local\n   policy reasons, or because it simply cannot support it), it MUST\n\
    \   refresh the PW OAM message with the timer value it desires.  The\n   receiving\
    \ PE will then set its timeout timer according to the new\n   refresh timer value\
    \ that is in the packet received, regardless of\n   what timer value it requested.\
    \  The receiving PE MUST NOT request a\n   new refresh timer value more than once\
    \ per refresh interval.\n   The suggested default value for the refresh timer\
    \ value in the\n   acknowledgment packet is 600 seconds.\n   If the sender PE\
    \ receives an acknowledgment message that does not\n   match the current active\
    \ PW status message being sent, it simply\n   ignores the acknowledgment packet.\n\
    \   If a PE that has received a non-zero status code for a PW detects by\n   any\
    \ means that the far end PE has become unreachable, it will follow\n   the standard\
    \ defect entry procedures of [RFC6310], Section 6.2.\n"

  contents:

  - "6.  S-PE Operation\n   The S-PE will operate according to the procedures defined\
    \ in\n   [RFC6073].  The following additional procedures apply to the case\n \

  contents:
  - "6.1.  Static PW to Another Static PW\n   The procedures that are described in\
    \ [RFC6073] Section 10 also apply\n   to the case of a static PW switched to another\
    \ static PW.  The LDP\n   header is simply replaced by the PW OAM header; otherwise,\
    \ the packet\n   format will be identical.  The information that is necessary\
    \ to form\n   an SP-PE TLV MUST be configured in the S-PE, or no SP-PE TLV will\
    \ be\n   sent.  [RFC6073] defines the IANA \"Pseudowire Switching Point PE TLV\n\
    \   Type\" registry.  In order to support the static PW configuration and\n  \
    \ addressing scheme, the following new code point has been assigned:\n      Type\
    \  Length   Description\n      ----  ------   -----------\n      0x07      24\
    \   Static PW/MPLS-TP PW segment ID of last\n                     PW segment traversed\n\

    \ in [RFC6426].\n"
- title: 6.2.  Dynamic PW to Static PW or Vice Versa
  contents:
  - "6.2.  Dynamic PW to Static PW or Vice Versa\n   The procedures that are described\
    \ in Section 10 of [RFC6073] also\n   apply to this situation.  However, if the\
    \ PW label of the LDP-\n   controlled PW segment is withdrawn by the adjacent\
    \ PE, the S-PE will\n   set the PW status code \"0x00000001 - Pseudowire Not Forwarding\"\
    \ to\n   the adjacent PW on the static PW segment.\n   The S-PE will only withdraw\
    \ its label for the dynamic, LDP-controlled\n   PW segment if the S-PE is not\
    \ provisioned.\n"
