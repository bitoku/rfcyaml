- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   For a number of years, the ITU-T has been designing a connection-\n\
    \   oriented packet switched technology to be used in Transport Networks.\n  \
    \ A Transport Network can be considered to be the network that provides\n   wide\
    \ area connectivity upon which other services, such as IP or the\n   phone network,\
    \ run.  The ITU-T chose to adapt the IETF's MPLS to this\n   task, and introduced\
    \ a protocol suite known as T-MPLS.\n   Quite late in the ITU-T design and specification\
    \ cycle, there were a\n   number of liaison exchanges between the ITU-T and the\
    \ IETF concerning\n   this technology.  These liaisons can be found on the IETF\
    \ Liaison\n   Statement web page [LIAISON].  In addition, the chairs of the MPLS,\n\
    \   PWE3, BFD, and CCAMP working groups as well as the Routing and\n   Internet\
    \ Area Directors attended a number of ITU-T meetings.  During\n   this process,\
    \ the IETF became increasingly concerned that the\n   incompatibility of IETF\
    \ MPLS and ITU-T T-MPLS would \"represent a\n   mutual danger to both the Internet\
    \ and the Transport network\".  These\n   concerns led the chairs of the IESG\
    \ and IAB to take the step of\n   sending a liaison to the ITU-T, stating that\
    \ either T-MPLS should\n   become fully compliant MPLS protocol, standardized\
    \ under the IETF\n   process (the so-called \"Option 1\"), or it should become\
    \ a completely\n   disjoint protocol with a new name and completely new set of\
    \ code\n   points (the so-called \"Option 2\") [Ethertypes].\n   Option 1 and\
    \ Option 2 were discussed at an ITU-T meeting of Question\n   12 Study Group 15\
    \ in Stuttgart [Stuttgart], where it was proposed\n   that a Joint (ITU-T - IETF)\
    \ Team should be formed to evaluate the\n   issues, and make a recommendation\
    \ to ITU-T management on the best way\n   forward.\n   Following discussion between\
    \ the management of the IETF and the\n   ITU-T, a Joint Working Team (JWT) was\
    \ established; this was supported\n   by an IETF Design Team and an Ad Hoc Group\
    \ on T-MPLS in the ITU-T\n   [ahtmpls].  The first meeting of the Ad Hoc group\
    \ occurred during the\n   ITU-T Geneva Plenary in February 2008.  As a result\
    \ of the work of\n   the JWT and the resulting agreement on a way forward, the\
    \ fears that\n   a set of next-generation network transport specifications developed\n\
    \   by ITU-T could cause interoperability problems were allayed.\n   The JWT submitted\
    \ their report to the ITU-T and IETF management in\n   the form of a set of Power\
    \ Point slides [MPLS-TP-22].  (See the PDF\n   of this RFC.)  The ITU-T have accepted\
    \ the JWT recommendations, as\n   documented in [MPLS-TP].  This RFC archives\
    \ the JWT report in a\n   format that is accessible to the IETF.\n   This RFC\
    \ is available in ASCII (which contains a summary of the\n   slides) and in PDF\
    \ (which contains the summary and a copy of the\n   slides).  In the case of a\
    \ conflict between the summary and the\n   slides, the slides take precedence.\
    \  Since those slides were the\n   basis of an important agreement between the\
    \ IETF and the ITU-T, it\n   should further be noted that in the event that the\
    \ PDF version of the\n   slides differs from those emailed to ITU-T and IETF management\
    \ on 18\n   April 2008 by the co-chairs of the JWT, the emailed slides take\n\
    \   precedence.\n"
- title: 2.  Executive Summary
  contents:
  - "2.  Executive Summary\n   Slides 4 to 10 provide an executive summary of the\
    \ JWT Report.  The\n   following is a summary of those slides:\n   The JWT achieved\
    \ consensus on the recommendation of Option 1: to\n   jointly agree to work together\
    \ and bring transport requirements into\n   the IETF and extend IETF MPLS forwarding,\
    \ OAM, survivability, network\n   management, and control plane protocols to meet\
    \ those requirements\n   through the IETF Standards Process.  The Joint Working\
    \ Team believed\n   that this would fulfill the mutual goals of improving the\n\
    \   functionality of the transport networks and the Internet and\n   guaranteeing\
    \ complete interoperability and architectural soundness.\n   This technology would\
    \ be referred to as the Transport Profile for\n   MPLS (MPLS-TP).\n   The JWT\
    \ recommended that future work should focus on:\n   In the IETF:\n      Definition\
    \ of the MPLS \"Transport Profile\" (MPLS-TP).\n   In the ITU-T:\n      Integration\
    \ of MPLS-TP into the transport network,\n      Alignment of the current T-MPLS\
    \ ITU-T Recommendations with MPLS-TP\n      and,\n      Termination of the work\
    \ on current T-MPLS.\n   The technical feasibility analysis concluded there were\
    \ no \"show\n   stopper\" issues in the recommendation of Option 1 and that the\
    \ IETF\n   MPLS and Pseudowire architecture could be extended to support\n   transport\
    \ functional requirements.  Therefore, the team believed that\n   there was no\
    \ need for the analysis of any other option.\n   The JWT proposed that the MPLS\
    \ Interoperability Design Team (MEAD\n   Team), JWT, and Ad Hoc T-MPLS groups\
    \ continue as described in SG15\n   TD515/PLEN [JWTcreation] with the following\
    \ roles:\n      Facilitate the rapid exchange of information between the IETF\
    \ and\n      ITU-T,\n      Ensure that the work is progressing with a consistent\
    \ set of\n      priorities,\n      Identify gaps/inconsistencies in the solutions\
    \ under development,\n      Propose solutions for consideration by the appropriate\
    \ WG/\n      Question,\n      Provide guidance when work on a topic is stalled\
    \ or a technical\n      decision must be mediated.\n   None of these groups would\
    \ have the authority to create or modify\n   IETF RFCs or ITU-T Recommendations.\
    \  Any such work would be\n   progressed via the normal process of the respective\
    \ standards body.\n   Direct participation in the work by experts from the IETF\
    \ and ITU-T\n   would be required.\n   The JWT recommended that the normative\
    \ definition of the MPLS-TP that\n   supports the ITU-T transport network requirements\
    \ be captured in IETF\n   RFCs.  It proposed that the ITU-T should:\n      Develop\
    \ ITU-T Recommendations to allow MPLS-TP to be integrated\n      with current\
    \ transport equipment and networks, including in\n      agreement with the IETF,\
    \ the definition of any ITU-T-specific\n      functionality within the MPLS-TP\
    \ architecture via the MPLS change\n      process [RFC4929],\n      Revise existing\
    \ ITU-T Recommendations to align with MPLS-TP,\n      ITU-T Recommendations will\
    \ make normative references to the\n      appropriate RFCs.\n   The executive\
    \ summary contains a number of detailed JWT\n   recommendations to both IETF and\
    \ ITU-T management together with\n   proposed document structure and timetable.\n\
    \   These JWT recommendations were accepted by ITU-T management\n   [MPLS-TP1].\n"
- title: 3.  Introduction and Background Material
  contents:
  - "3.  Introduction and Background Material\n   Slides 11 to 22 provide introductory\
    \ and background material.\n   The starting point of the analysis was to attempt\
    \ to satisfy Option 1\n   by showing the high-level architecture, any show stoppers,\
    \ and the\n   design points that would need to be addressed after the decision\
    \ had\n   been made to work together.  Option 1 was stated as preferred by the\n\
    \   IETF and because Option 1 was shown to be feasible, Option 2 was not\n   explored.\n\
    \   The work was segmented into five groups looking at: Forwarding, OAM,\n   Protection,\
    \ Control Plane, and Network Management.  The outcome of\n   each review was reported\
    \ in the following sections and is summarized\n   below.\n   There follows a detailed\
    \ description of the overall requirements and\n   architectural assumptions that\
    \ would be used in the remainder of the\n   work.\n"
- title: 4.  High-Level Architecture
  contents:
  - "4.  High-Level Architecture\n   Slides 23 to 28 provide a high-level architectural\
    \ view of the\n   proposed design.\n   The spectrum of services that the MPLS-TP\
    \ needs to address and the\n   wider MPLS context is described, together with\
    \ the provisioning\n   issues.  Some basic terminology needed in order to understand\
    \ the\n   MPLS-TP is defined and some context examples are provided.\n"
- title: 5.  OAM and Forwarding
  contents:
  - "5.  OAM and Forwarding\n   Slides 29 to 32 describe the OAM requirements and\
    \ talk about segment\n   recovery and node identification.\n   Slides 33 to 38\
    \ introduce OAM hierarchy and describe Label Switched\n   Path (LSP) monitoring,\
    \ the Maintenance End Point (MEP) and\n   Maintenance Intermediate Point (MIP)\
    \ relationship and the LSP and\n   pseudowire (PW) monitoring relationship.\n\
    \   Sides 39 to 46 introduce the Associated Channel Header (ACH) and its\n   generalization\
    \ to carry the OAM over LSPs through the use of the\n   \"Label for You\" (LFU).\n\
    \   Slides 47 to 48 provide a description of how the forwarding and the\n   ACH\
    \ OAM mechanism work in detail.  A significant number of scenarios\n   are described\
    \ to work through the operation on a case-by-case basis.\n   These slides introduce\
    \ a new textual notation to simplify the\n   description of complex MPLS stacks.\n\
    \   Note that the MPLS forwarding, as specified by IETF RFCs, requires no\n  \
    \ changes to support MPLS-TP.\n"
- title: 6.  Control Plane
  contents:
  - "6.  Control Plane\n   Sides 79 to 83 discuss various aspects of the control plane\
    \ design.\n   Control plane sub-team stated that existing IETF protocols can be\n\
    \   used to provide required functions for transport network operation\n   and\
    \ for data-communications-network/switched-circuit-network\n   operation.  IETF\
    \ GMPLS protocols have already applied to Automatic\n   Switched Optical Network\
    \ (ASON) architecture, and the JWT considered\n   that any protocol extensions\
    \ needed will be easy to make.  The slides\n   provide a number of scenarios to\
    \ demonstrate this conclusion.\n"
- title: 7.  Survivability
  contents:
  - "7.  Survivability\n   The survivability considerations are provided in slides\
    \ 95 to 104.\n   The survivability sub-team did not find any issues that prevented\
    \ the\n   creation of an MPLS-TP, and therefore recommended that Option 1 be\n\
    \   selected.  Three potential solutions were identified.  Each solution\n   has\
    \ different attributes and advantages, and it was thought that\n   further work\
    \ in the design phase should eliminate one or more of\n   these options and/or\
    \ provide an applicability statement.\n   After some clarifications and discussion,\
    \ there follow in the slide\n   set a number of linear and ring protection scenarios\
    \ with examples of\n   how they might be addressed.\n"
- title: 8.  Network Management
  contents:
  - "8.  Network Management\n   Slide 106 states the conclusion of the Network Management\
    \ sub-team :\n   that it found no issues that prevent the creation of an MPLS-TP\
    \ and\n   hence Option 1 can be selected.\n"
- title: 9.  Summary
  contents:
  - "9.  Summary\n   Slide 113 provides a summary of the JWT report.\n   The JWT found\
    \ no show stoppers and unanimously agreed that they had\n   identified a viable\
    \ solution.  They therefore recommend Option 1.\n   They stated that in their\
    \ view, it is technically feasible that the\n   existing MPLS architecture can\
    \ be extended to meet the requirements\n   of a Transport profile, and that the\
    \ architecture allows for a single\n   OAM technology for LSPs, PWs, and a deeply\
    \ nested network.  From\n   probing various ITU-T Study Groups and IETF Working\
    \ Groups it appears\n   that MPLS reserved label 14 has had wide enough implementation\
    \ and\n   deployment that the solution may have to use a different reserved\n\
    \   label (e.g., Label 13).  The JWT recommended that extensions to Label\n  \
    \ 14 should cease.\n   The JWT further recommended that this architecture appeared\
    \ to\n   subsume Y.1711, since the requirements can be met by the mechanism\n\
    \   proposed in their report.\n"

  contents:
  - "10.  IANA Considerations\n   There are no IANA considerations that arise from\
    \ this document.\n   Any IANA allocations needed to implement the JWT recommendation\
    \ will\n   be requested in the Standards-Track RFCs that define the MPLS-TP\n\
    \   protocol.\n"
- title: 11.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "11.  Security Considerations\n   The only security consideration that arises\
    \ as a result of this\n   document is the need to ensure that this is a faithful\
    \ representation\n   of the JWT report.\n   The protocol work that arises from\
    \ this agreement will have technical\n   security requirements that will be identified\
    \ in the RFCs that define\n   MPLS-TP.\n"
