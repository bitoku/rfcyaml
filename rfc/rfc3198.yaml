  - "1. Introduction\n   This document provides abbreviations, definitions, and explanations\n\
    \   of terms related to network policy.  All definitions are provided in\n   Section\
    \ 3, with the terms listed in alphabetical order.\n   The intent is to improve\
    \ the comprehensibility and consistency of\n   Internet Standards documents (ISDs)\
    \ -- i.e., RFCs, Internet-Drafts,\n   and other material produced as part of the\
    \ Internet Standards Process\n   [RFC2026].  Benefits across the ISDs are well-stated\
    \ in the\n   Introduction to RFC 2828 [RFC2828]:\n   o  \"Clear, Concise, and\
    \ Easily Understood Documentation\" - Requires\n      that the set of terms and\
    \ definitions be consistent, self-\n      supporting and uniform across all ISDs.\n\
    \   o  Technical Excellence - Where all ISDs use terminology accurately,\n   \
    \   precisely, and unambiguously.\n   o  Prior Implementation and Testing - Requires\
    \ that terms are used in\n      their plainest form, that private and \"made-up\"\
    \ terms are avoided\n      in ISDs, and that new definitions are not created that\
    \ conflict\n      with established ones.\n   o  \"Openness, Fairness, and Timeliness\"\
    \ - Where ISDs avoid terms that\n      are proprietary or otherwise favor a particular\
    \ vendor, or that\n      create a bias toward a particular technology or mechanism.\n\
    \   Common and/or controversial policy terms are defined.  These terms\n   are\
    \ directly related and specific to network policy.\n   Wherever possible, this\
    \ document takes definitions from existing\n   ISDs.  It should be noted that:\n\
    \   o  Expired Internet-Drafts are not referenced, nor are their\n      terminology\
    \ and definitions used in this document.\n   o  Multiple definitions may exist\
    \ across the ISDs.  Each definition\n      is listed, with its source.\n"
- title: 2. Explanation of Paragraph Markings
  contents:
  - "2. Explanation of Paragraph Markings\n   Section 3 marks terms and definitions\
    \ as follows:\n   o  Capitalization: Only terms that are proper nouns are capitalized.\n\
    \   o  Paragraph Marking: Definitions and explanations are stated in\n      paragraphs\
    \ that are marked as follows:\n      -  \"P\" identifies basic policy-related\
    \ terms.\n      -  \"T\" identifies various techniques to create or convey policy-\n\
    \         related information in a network.  For example, COPS and an\n      \
    \   \"Information Model\" are two techniques for communicating and\n         describing\
    \ policy-related data.  SNMP and MIBs are another.\n      -  \"A\" identifies\
    \ specific Work Groups and general \"areas of use\"\n         of policy.  For\
    \ example, AAA and QoS are two \"areas of use\"\n         where policy concepts\
    \ are extremely important to their function\n         and operation.\n"

  - "3. Terms\n   Note:  In providing policy definitions, other \"technology specific\"\
    \n   terms (for example, related to Differentiated Services) may be used\n   and\
    \ referenced.  These non-policy terms will not be defined in this\n   document,\
    \ and the reader is requested to go to the referenced ISD for\n   additional detail.\n\
    \   $ AAA\n      See \"Authentication, Authorization, Accounting\".\n   $ abstraction\
    \ levels\n      See \"policy abstraction\".\n   $ action\n      See \"policy action\"\
    .\n   $ Authentication, Authorization, Accounting (AAA)\n      (A) AAA deals with\
    \ control, authentication, authorization and\n          accounting of systems\
    \ and environments based on policies set\n          by the administrators and\
    \ users of the systems.  The use of\n          policy may be implicit - as defined\
    \ by RADIUS [RFC2138]. In\n          RADIUS, a network access server sends dial-user\
    \ credentials to\n          an AAA server, and receives authentication that the\
    \ user is\n          who he/she claims, along with a set of attribute-value pairs\n\
    \          authorizing various service features. Policy is implied in\n      \
    \    both the authentication, which can be restricted by time of\n          day,\
    \ number of sessions, calling number, etc., and the\n          attribute-values\
    \ authorized.\n   $ CIM\n      See \"Common Information Model\".\n   $ Common\
    \ Information Model (CIM)\n      (T) An object-oriented information model published\
    \ by the DMTF\n          (Distributed Management Task Force) [DMTF].  It consists\
    \ of a\n          Specification detailing the abstract modeling constructs and\n\
    \          principles of the Information Model, and a textual language\n     \
    \     definition to represent the Model.  CIM's schemas are defined\n        \
    \  as a set of files, written in the language of the\n          Specification,\
    \ with graphical renderings using UML [UML].\n          Sets of classes and associations\
    \ represent CIM's Core and\n          Common Models, defining an information model\
    \ for the\n          \"enterprise\" - addressing general concepts (in Core), and\n\
    \          systems, devices, users, software distribution, the physical\n    \
    \      environment, networks and policy (in the Common Models).  (See\n      \
    \    also \"information model\".)\n   $ Common Open Policy Service (COPS)\n  \
    \    (T) A simple query and response TCP-based protocol that can be\n        \
    \  used to exchange policy information between a Policy Decision\n          Point\
    \ (PDP) and its clients (Policy Enforcement Points, PEPs)\n          [RFC2748].\
    \  The COPS protocol is used to provide for the\n          outsourcing of policy\
    \ decisions for RSVP [RFC2749]. Another\n          usage is for the provisioning\
    \ of policy [RFC3084]. (See also\n          \"Policy Decision Point\" and \"Policy\
    \ Enforcement Point\".)\n   $ condition\n      See \"policy condition\".\n   $\
    \ configuration\n      (P) \"Configuration\" can be defined from two perspectives:\n\
    \          -  The set of parameters in network elements and other systems\n  \
    \           that determine their function and operation. Some\n             parameters\
    \ are static, such as packet queue assignment and\n             can be predefined\
    \ and downloaded to a network element.\n             Others are more dynamic,\
    \ such as the actions taken by a\n             network device upon the occurrence\
    \ of some event.  The\n             distinction between static (predefined) \"\
    configuration\" and\n             the dynamic state of network elements blurs\
    \ as setting\n             parameters becomes more responsive, and signaling controls\n\
    \             greater degrees of a network device's behavior.\n          -  A\
    \ static setup of a network element, done before shipment\n             to a customer\
    \ and which cannot be modified by the customer.\n          The first is the accepted\
    \ usage in the Internet community.\n   $ COPS\n      See \"Common Open Policy\
    \ Service\".\n   $ data model\n      (T) A mapping of the contents of an information\
    \ model into a form\n          that is specific to a particular type of data store\
    \ or\n          repository.  A \"data model\" is basically the rendering of an\n\
    \          information model according to a specific set of mechanisms\n     \
    \     for representing, organizing, storing and handling data.  It\n         \
    \ has three parts [DecSupp]:\n          -  A collection of data structures such\
    \ as lists, tables,\n             relations, etc.\n          -  A collection of\
    \ operations that can be applied to the\n             structures such as retrieval,\
    \ update, summation, etc.\n          -  A collection of integrity rules that define\
    \ the legal\n             states (set of values) or changes of state (operations\
    \ on\n             values).\n          (See also \"information model\".)\n   $\
    \ DEN\n      See \"Directory Enabled Networks\".\n   $ Differentiated Services\
    \ (DS)\n      (T) The IP header field, called the DS-field.  In IPv4, it defines\n\
    \          the layout of the ToS (Type of Service) octet; in IPv6, it is\n   \
    \       the Traffic Class octet [RFC2474].\n      (A) \"Differentiated Services\"\
    \ is also an \"area of use\" for QoS\n          policies.  It requires policy\
    \ to define the correspondence\n          between codepoints in the packet's DS-field\
    \ and individual\n          per-hop behaviors (to achieve a specified per-domain\n\
    \          behavior).  In addition, policy can be used to specify the\n      \
    \    routing of packets based on various classification criteria.\n          (See\
    \ also \"Quality of Service\" and \"filter\".)\n   $ diffserv\n      See \"Differentiated\
    \ Services\".\n   $ Directory Enabled Networks (DEN)\n      (T) A data model that\
    \ is the LDAP mapping of CIM (the Common\n          Information Model).  Its goals\
    \ are to enable the deployment\n          and use of policy by starting with common\
    \ service and user\n          concepts (defined in the information model), specifying\
    \ their\n          mapping/storage in an LDAP-based repository, and using these\n\
    \          concepts in vendor/device-independent policy rules [DMTF].\n      \
    \    (See also \"Common Information Model\" and \"data model\".)\n   $ domain\n\
    \      (P) A collection of elements and services, administered in a\n        \
    \  coordinated fashion.  (See also \"policy domain\".)\n   $ DS\n      See \"\
    Differentiated Services\".\n   $ filter\n      (T) A set of terms and/or criteria\
    \ used for the purpose of\n          separating or categorizing.  This is accomplished\
    \ via single-\n          or multi-field matching of traffic header and/or payload\
    \ data.\n          \"Filters\" are often manipulated and used in network operation\n\
    \          and policy.  For example, packet filters specify the criteria\n   \
    \       for matching a pattern (for example, IP or 802 criteria) to\n        \
    \  distinguish separable classes of traffic.\n   $ goal\n      See \"policy goal\"\
    .\n   $ information model\n      (T) An abstraction and representation of the\
    \ entities in a managed\n          environment, their properties, attributes and\
    \ operations, and\n          the way that they relate to each other.  It is independent\
    \ of\n          any specific repository, software usage, protocol, or\n      \
    \    platform.\n   $ Management Information Base (MIB)\n      (T) A collection\
    \ of information that can be accessed via the\n          Simple Network Management\
    \ Protocol.  Management information is\n          defined in MIB modules using\
    \ the rules contained in SNMP's\n          Structure of Management Information\
    \ (SMI) specifications\n          [RFC2570].  Management information is an abstract\
    \ concept, and\n          definitions can be created for high level policy\n \
    \         specifications, low level policy, as well as technology and\n      \
    \    vendor specific configurations, status and statistics.  (See\n          also\
    \ \"Simple Network Management Protocol\" and \"Structure of\n          Management\
    \ Information\".)\n   $ MIB\n      See \"Management Information Base\".\n   $\
    \ MPLS\n      See \"Multiprotocol Label Switching\".  (Also, MPLS may refer to\n\
    \      Multi-Protocol Lambda Switching in optical networks.  But, this is\n  \
    \    unrelated to policy and not discussed further in this document.)\n   $ Multiprotocol\
    \ Label Switching (MPLS)\n      (T) Integrates a label swapping and switching\
    \ framework with\n          network layer routing [RFC2702].  The basic idea involves\n\
    \          assigning short fixed length labels to packets at the ingress\n   \
    \       to an MPLS cloud.  Throughout the interior of the MPLS domain,\n     \
    \     the labels attached to packets are used to make forwarding\n          decisions\
    \ (usually without recourse to the original packet\n          headers).\n   $\
    \ outsourced policy\n      (P) An execution model where a policy enforcement device\
    \ issues a\n          query to delegate a decision for a specific policy event\
    \ to\n          another component, external to it.  For example, in RSVP, the\n\
    \          arrival of a new RSVP message to a PEP requires a fast policy\n   \
    \       decision (not to delay the end-to-end setup). The PEP may use\n      \
    \    COPS-RSVP to send a query to the PDP, asking for a policy\n          decision\
    \ [RFC2205, RFC2748].  \"Outsourced policy\" is\n          contrasted with \"\
    provisioned policy\", but they are not\n          mutually exclusive and operational\
    \ systems may combine the\n          two.\n   $ PCIM\n      See \"Policy Core\
    \ Information Model\".\n   $ PDP\n      See \"Policy Decision Point\".\n   $ PEP\n\
    \      See \"Policy Enforcement Point\".\n   $ PIB\n      See \"Policy Information\
    \ Base\".\n   $ policy\n      (P) \"Policy\" can be defined from two perspectives:\n\
    \          -  A definite goal, course or method of action to guide and\n     \
    \        determine present and future decisions.  \"Policies\" are\n         \
    \    implemented or executed within a particular context (such\n             as\
    \ policies defined within a business unit).\n          -  Policies as a set of\
    \ rules to administer, manage, and\n             control access to network resources\
    \ [RFC3060].\n          Note that these two views are not contradictory since\n\
    \          individual rules may be defined in support of business goals.\n   \
    \       (See also \"policy goal\", \"policy abstraction\" and \"policy\n     \
    \     rule\".)\n   $ policy abstraction\n      (P) Policy can be represented at\
    \ different levels, ranging from\n          business goals to device-specific\
    \ configuration parameters.\n          Translation between different levels of\
    \ \"abstraction\" may\n          require information other than policy, such as\
    \ network and\n          host parameter configuration and capabilities.  Various\n\
    \          documents and implementations may specify explicit levels of\n    \
    \      abstraction.  However, these do not necessarily correspond to\n       \
    \   distinct processing entities or the complete set of levels in\n          all\
    \ environments.  (See also \"configuration\" and \"policy\n          translation\"\
    .)\n   $ policy action\n      (P) Definition of what is to be done to enforce\
    \ a policy rule,\n          when the conditions of the rule are met.  Policy actions\
    \ may\n          result in the execution of one or more operations to affect\n\
    \          and/or configure network traffic and network resources.\n         \
    \ -  In [RFC3060], a rule's actions may be ordered.\n   $ policy condition\n \
    \     (P) A representation of the necessary state and/or prerequisites\n     \
    \     that define whether a policy rule's actions should be\n          performed.\
    \  This representation need not be completely\n          specified, but may be\
    \ implicitly provided in an implementation\n          or protocol.  When the policy\
    \ condition(s) associated with a\n          policy rule evaluate to TRUE, then\
    \ (subject to other\n          considerations such as rule priorities and decision\n\
    \          strategies) the rule should be enforced.\n      (T) In [RFC3060], a\
    \ rule's conditions can be expressed as either\n          an ORed set of ANDed\
    \ sets of statements (disjunctive normal\n          form), or an ANDed set of\
    \ ORed sets of statements (conjunctive\n          normal form).  Individual condition\
    \ statements can also be\n          negated.\n   $ policy conflict\n      (P)\
    \ Occurs when the actions of two rules (that are both satisfied\n          simultaneously)\
    \ contradict each other.  The entity\n          implementing the policy would\
    \ not be able to determine which\n          action to perform.  The implementers\
    \ of policy systems must\n          provide conflict detection and avoidance or\
    \ resolution\n          mechanisms to prevent this situation.  \"Policy conflict\"\
    \ is\n          contrasted with \"policy error\".\n   $ policy conversion\n  \
    \    See \"policy translation\".\n   $ Policy Core Information Model (PCIM) [RFC3060]\n\
    \      (T) An information model describing the basic concepts of policy\n    \
    \      groups, rules, conditions, actions, repositories and their\n          relationships.\
    \  This model is described as a \"core\" model\n          since it cannot be applied\
    \ without domain-specific extensions\n          (for example, extensions for QoS\
    \ or IPsec).  PCIM is \"core\"\n          with respect to the area of policy.\
    \  However, it is a \"Common\n          Model,\" with respect to CIM - in that\
    \ it extends the basic CIM\n          concepts for policy.  (See also \"Common\
    \ Information Model\".)\n   $ policy decision\n      (P) Two perspectives of \"\
    policy decision\" exist:\n          -  A \"process\" perspective that deals with\
    \ the evaluation of a\n             policy rule's conditions\n          -  A \"\
    result\" perspective that deals with the actions for\n             enforcement,\
    \ when the conditions of a policy rule are TRUE\n   $ Policy Decision Point (PDP)\n\
    \      (P) A logical entity that makes policy decisions for itself or for\n  \
    \        other network elements that request such decisions [RFC2753].\n     \
    \     (See also \"policy decision\".)\n   $ policy domain\n      (P) A collection\
    \ of elements and services, and/or a portion of an\n          Internet over which\
    \ a common and consistent set of policies\n          are administered in a coordinated\
    \ fashion [RFC2474]. This\n          definition of a policy domain does not preclude\
    \ multiple\n          sources of policy creation within an organization, but does\n\
    \          require that the resultant policies be coordinated.\n          -  Policies\
    \ defined in the context of one domain may need to\n             be communicated\
    \ or negotiated outside of that domain. (See\n             also \"policy negotiation\"\
    .)\n   $ policy enforcement\n      (P) The execution of a policy decision.\n \
    \  $ Policy Enforcement Point (PEP)\n      (P) A logical entity that enforces\
    \ policy decisions [RFC2753].\n          (See also \"policy enforcement\".)\n\
    \   $ policy error\n      (P) \"Policy errors\" occur when attempts to enforce\
    \ policy actions\n          fail, whether due to temporary state or permanent\
    \ mismatch\n          between the policy actions and the device enforcement\n\
    \          capabilities.  This is contrasted with \"policy conflict\".\n   $ policy\
    \ goal\n      (P) Goals are the business objectives or desired state intended\
    \ to\n          be maintained by a policy system.  As the highest level of\n \
    \         abstraction of policy, these goals are most directly described\n   \
    \       in business rather than technical terms.  For example, a goal\n      \
    \    might state that a particular application operate on a network\n        \
    \  as though it had its own dedicated network, despite using a\n          shared\
    \ infrastructure. 'Policy goals' can include the\n          objectives of a service\
    \ level agreement, as well as the\n          assignment of resources to applications\
    \ or individuals.  A\n          policy system may be created that automatically\
    \ strives to\n          achieve a goal through feedback regarding whether the\
    \ goal\n          (such as a service level) is being met.\n   $ Policy Information\
    \ Base (PIB)\n      (T) Collections of related PRovisioning Classes (PRCs), defined\
    \ as\n          a module.  (See also \"PRovisioning Class\".)\n   $ policy mapping\n\
    \      See \"policy translation\".\n   $ policy negotiation\n      (P) Exposing\
    \ the desired or appropriate part of a policy to\n          another domain.  This\
    \ is necessary to support partial\n          interconnection between domains,\
    \ which are operating with\n          different sets of policies.\n   $ policy\
    \ repository\n      (P) \"Policy repository\" can be defined from three perspectives:\n\
    \          -  A specific data store that holds policy rules, their\n         \
    \    conditions and actions, and related policy data.  A\n             database\
    \ or directory would be an example of such a store.\n          -  A logical container\
    \ representing the administrative scope\n             and naming of policy rules,\
    \ their conditions and actions,\n             and related policy data.  A \"QoS\
    \ policy\" domain would be an\n             example of such a container.\n   \
    \       -  In [RFC3060], a more restrictive definition than the prior\n      \
    \       one exists.  A PolicyRepository is a model abstraction\n             representing\
    \ an administratively defined, logical container\n             for reusable policy\
    \ elements.\n   $ policy request\n      (P) A message requesting a policy-related\
    \ service.  This may refer\n          to a request to retrieve a specific set\
    \ of policy rules, to\n          determine the actions to enforce, or other policy\
    \ requests.\n          When sent by a PEP to a PDP, it is more accurately qualified\n\
    \          as a \"policy decision request\" [RFC2753].  (See also \"policy\n \
    \         decision\".)\n   $ policy rule\n      (P) A basic building block of\
    \ a policy-based system.  It is the\n          binding of a set of actions to\
    \ a set of conditions - where the\n          conditions are evaluated to determine\
    \ whether the actions are\n          performed [RFC3060].\n   $ policy server\n\
    \      (P) A marketing term whose definition is imprecise. Originally,\n     \
    \     [RFC2753] referenced a \"policy server\".  As the RFC evolved,\n       \
    \   this term became more precise and known as the Policy Decision\n         \
    \ Point (PDP).  Today, the term is used in marketing and other\n          literature\
    \ to refer specifically to a PDP, or for any entity\n          that uses/services\
    \ policy.\n   $ policy translation\n      (P) The transformation of a policy from\
    \ a representation and/or\n          level of abstraction, to another representation\
    \ or level of\n          abstraction.  For example, it may be necessary to convert\
    \ PIB\n          data to a command line format.  In this \"conversion,\" the\n\
    \          translation to the new representation is likely to require a\n    \
    \      change in the level of abstraction (becoming more or less\n          specific).\
    \  Although these are logically distinct tasks, they\n          are (in most cases)\
    \ blurred in the act of\n          translating/converting/mapping.  Therefore,\
    \ this is also known\n          as \"policy conversion\" or \"policy mapping\"\
    .\n   $ PolicyGroup\n      (T) An abstraction in the Policy Core Information Model\
    \ [RFC3060].\n          It is a class representing a container, aggregating either\n\
    \          policy rules or other policy groups.  It allows the grouping\n    \
    \      of rules into a Policy, and the refinement of high-level\n          Policies\
    \ to lower-level or different (i.e., converted or\n          translated) peer\
    \ groups.\n   $ PRC\n      See \"PRovisioning Class\".\n   $ PRI\n      See \"\
    PRovisioning Instance\".\n   $ provisioned policy\n      (P) An execution model\
    \ where network elements are pre-configured,\n          based on policy, prior\
    \ to processing events. Configuration is\n          pushed to the network device,\
    \ e.g., based on time of day or at\n          initial booting of the device. \
    \ The focus of this model is on\n          the distribution of configuration information,\
    \ and is\n          exemplified by Differentiated Services [RFC2475].  Based on\n\
    \          events received, devices use downloaded (pre-provisioned)\n       \
    \   mechanisms to implement policy. \"Provisioned policy\" is\n          contrasted\
    \ with \"outsourced policy\".\n   $ PRovisioning Class (PRC)\n      (T) An ordered\
    \ set of attributes representing a type of policy\n          data.  PRCs are defined\
    \ in PIB modules (encoded using SPPI)\n          and registered in the Object\
    \ Identifier tree.  Instances of\n          each PRC are organized in tables,\
    \ similar to conceptual tables\n          in SMIv2.  (See also \"Structure of\
    \ Policy Provisioning\n          Information\" and \"Policy Information Base\"\
    .)\n          The acronym, PRC, has evolved from \"policy rule class\" to\n  \
    \        \"provisioning class\".  The reason for the change is that a\n      \
    \    discrepancy existed between the use of the words, \"policy\n          rule\"\
    \ in the PRC context versus other uses in PCIM and the\n          industry.  In\
    \ the latter, rules are If/Then statements - a\n          binding of conditions\
    \ to actions.  PRCs are not \"rules\" by\n          this definition, but the encoding\
    \ of (network-wide)\n          configuration information for a device.\n   $ PRovisioning\
    \ Instance (PRI)\n      (T) An instantiation of a PRovisioning Class.  (See also\n\
    \          \"PRovisioning Class\".)\n   $ QoS\n      See \"Quality of Service\"\
    .\n   $ Quality of Service (QoS)\n      (A) At a high level of abstraction, \"\
    Quality of Service\" refers to\n          the ability to deliver network services\
    \ according to the\n          parameters specified in a Service Level Agreement.\
    \ \"Quality\"\n          is characterized by service availability, delay, jitter,\n\
    \          throughput and packet loss ratio.  At a network resource\n        \
    \  level, \"Quality of Service\" refers to a set of capabilities\n          that\
    \ allow a service provider to prioritize traffic, control\n          bandwidth,\
    \ and network latency.  There are two different\n          approaches to \"Quality\
    \ of Service\" on IP networks: Integrated\n          Services [RFC1633], and Differentiated\
    \ Service [RFC2475].\n          Integrated Services require policy control over\
    \ the creation\n          of signaled reservations, which provide specific quantitative\n\
    \          end-to-end behavior for a (set of) flow(s).  In contrast,\n       \
    \   Differentiated Services require policy to define the\n          correspondence\
    \ between codepoints in the packet's DS-field and\n          individual per-hop\
    \ behaviors (to achieve a specified per-\n          domain behavior).  A maximum\
    \ of 64 per-hop behaviors limit the\n          number of classes of service traffic\
    \ that can be marked at any\n          point in a domain.  These classes of service\
    \ signal the\n          treatment of the packets with respect to various QoS aspects,\n\
    \          such as flow priority and packet drop precedence.  In\n          addition,\
    \ policy can be used to specify the routing of packets\n          based on various\
    \ classification criteria.  Policy controls the\n          set of configuration\
    \ parameters and routing for each class in\n          Differentiated Service,\
    \ and the admission conditions for\n          reservations in Integrated Services.\
    \  (See also \"policy\n          abstraction\" and \"Service Level Agreement\"\
    .)\n   $ Resource reSerVation Protocol (RSVP)\n      (T) A setup protocol designed\
    \ for an Integrated Services Internet,\n          to reserve network resources\
    \ for a path [RFC2205]. And, a\n          signaling mechanism for managing application\
    \ traffic's QoS in\n          a Differentiated Service network.\n   $ role\n \
    \     (P) \"Role\" is defined from three perspectives:\n          -  A business\
    \ position or function, to which people and\n             logical entities are\
    \ assigned [X.500]\n          -  The labeled endpoints of a UML (Unified Modeling\
    \ Language)\n             association.  Quoting from [UML], \"When a class\n \
    \            participates in an association, it has a specific role that\n   \
    \          it plays in that relationship; a role is just the face the\n      \
    \       class at the near end of the association presents to the\n           \
    \  class at the other end of the association\".  The Policy\n             Core\
    \ Information Model [RFC3060] uses UML to depict its\n             class hierarchy.\
    \ Relationships/associations are significant\n             in the model.\n   \
    \       -  An administratively specified characteristic of a managed\n       \
    \      element (for example, an interface).  It is a selector for\n          \
    \   policy rules and PRovisioning Classes (PRCs), to determine\n             the\
    \ applicability of the rule/PRC to a particular managed\n             element\
    \ [RFC3060].\n          Only the third definition (roles as selectors of policy)\
    \ is\n          directly related to the management of network policy. However,\n\
    \          the first definition (roles as business positions and\n          functions)\
    \ may be referenced in policy conditions and actions.\n   $ role combination\n\
    \      (P) A lexicographically ordered set of roles that characterize\n      \
    \    managed elements and indicate the applicability of policy\n          rules\
    \ and PRovisioning Classes (PRCs).  A policy system uses\n          the set of\
    \ roles reported by the managed element to determine\n          the correct rules/PRCs\
    \ to be sent for enforcement.  That\n          determination may examine all applicable\
    \ policy rules\n          identified by the role combination, its sub-combinations\
    \ and\n          the individual roles in the combination [RFC3060].  In the\n\
    \          case of PRCs, a PRC must explicitly match the role combination\n  \
    \        of the managed element in order to be applicable and/or\n          enforced.\
    \  (The comparison is typically case-sensitive.)  The\n          final set of\
    \ rules/PRCs for enforcement are defined by the\n          policy system, as appropriate\
    \ for the specified role\n          combination of the managed element.\n   $\
    \ RSVP\n      See \"Resource reSerVation Protocol\".\n   $ rule\n      See \"\
    policy rule\".\n   $ rule based engine\n      (T) A rule based engine is able\
    \ to evaluate policy condition(s)\n          and trigger appropriate policy actions.\
    \  A particular rule\n          based engine may only be capable of acting upon\
    \ policy rules\n          that are formatted in a specified way or adhere to a\
    \ specific\n          language.\n   $ schema\n      (T) Two different perspectives\
    \ of schema are defined:\n          -  A set of rules that determines what data\
    \ can be stored in a\n             database or directory service [DirServs]\n\
    \          -  A collection of data models that are each bound to the same\n  \
    \           type of repository.\n          The latter is the preferred and recommended\
    \ one for Internet\n          Standards documents.  (See also \"data model\".)\n\
    \   $ service\n      (P) The behavior or functionality provided by a network,\
    \ network\n          element or host [DMTF, RFC2216].  Quoting from RFC 2216\n\
    \          [RFC2216], in order to completely specify a \"service\", one\n    \
    \      must define the \"functions to be performed ..., the\n          information\
    \ required ... to perform these functions, and the\n          information made\
    \ available by the element to other elements of\n          the system\".  Policy\
    \ can be used to configure a \"service\" in a\n          network or on a network\
    \ element/host, invoke its\n          functionality, and/or coordinate services\
    \ in an interdomain or\n          end-to-end environment.\n   $ Service Level\
    \ Agreement (SLA)\n      (P) The documented result of a negotiation between a\n\
    \          customer/consumer and a provider of a service, that specifies\n   \
    \       the levels of availability, serviceability, performance,\n          operation\
    \ or other attributes of the service [RFC2475]. (See\n          also \"Service\
    \ Level Objective\".)\n   $ Service Level Objective (SLO)\n      (P) Partitions\
    \ an SLA into individual metrics and operational\n          information to enforce\
    \ and/or monitor the SLA.  \"Service Level\n          Objectives\" may be defined\
    \ as part of an SLA, an SLS, or in a\n          separate document.  It is a set\
    \ of parameters and their\n          values.  The actions of enforcing and reporting\
    \ monitored\n          compliance can be implemented as one or more policies.\
    \  (See\n          also \"Service Level Agreement\".)\n   $ Service Level Specification\
    \ (SLS)\n      (P) Specifies handling of customer's traffic by a network\n   \
    \       provider.  It is negotiated between a customer and the\n          provider,\
    \ and (for example) in a DiffServ environment, defines\n          parameters such\
    \ as specific Code Points and the Per-Hop-\n          Behavior, profile characteristics\
    \ and treatment of the traffic\n          for those Code Points.  An SLS is a\
    \ specific SLA (a negotiated\n          agreement) and its SLOs (the individual\
    \ metrics and\n          operational data to enforce) to guarantee quality of\
    \ service\n          for network traffic.  (See also \"Service Level Agreement\"\
    \ and\n          \"Service Level Objective\".)\n   $ Simple Network Management\
    \ Protocol (SNMP)\n      (T) SNMP is a framework (including a protocol) for managing\n\
    \          systems in a network environment [RFC2570].  It can be used\n     \
    \     for policy-based configuration and control using a specific\n          MIB\
    \ Module designed to execute policies on managed elements\n          via scripts.\
    \  The elements (instances) in a network device are\n          evaluated using\
    \ a policy filter, to determine where policy\n          will be applied.\n   $\

    \ that request.\n   $ target\n      (P) An entity, or collection of entities,\
    \ which is affected by a\n          policy.  For example, the \"targets\" of a\
