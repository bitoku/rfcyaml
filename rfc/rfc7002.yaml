- title: 1.1.  Discard Count Report Block
  contents:
  - "1.1.  Discard Count Report Block\n   This document defines a new block type to\
    \ augment those defined in\n   [RFC3611] for use in a range of RTP applications.\
    \  The new block type\n   supports the reporting of the number of packets that\
    \ are received\n   correctly but are never played out, typically because they\
    \ arrive too\n   late (buffer underflow) or too early (buffer overflow) to be\
    \ played\n   out.  The metric is applicable both to systems that use packet loss\n\
    \   repair techniques (such as forward error correction [RFC5109] or\n   retransmission\
    \ [RFC4588]) and to those that do not.\n   This metric is useful for identifying\
    \ the existence, and\n   characterizing the severity, of packet transport problems\
    \ that may\n   affect users' perceptions of a service delivered over RTP.\n  \
    \ This block may be used in conjunction with [RFC7003], which provides\n   additional\
    \ information on the pattern of discarded packets.  However,\n   the metric in\
    \ [RFC7003] may be used independently of the metrics in\n   this block.\n   When\
    \ a Discard Count Metrics Block is sent together with a Burst/Gap\n   Discard\
    \ Metrics Block (defined in [RFC7003]) to the media sender or\n   RTP-based network\
    \ management system, the information carried in the\n   Discard Count Metrics\
    \ Block and the Burst/Gap Discard Metrics Block\n   allows systems receiving the\
    \ blocks to calculate burst/gap summary\n   statistics (e.g., the gap discard\
    \ rate).\n   The metric belongs to the class of transport-related end-system\n\
    \   metrics defined in [RFC6792].\n"
- title: 1.2.  RTCP and RTCP Extended Reports
  contents:
  - "1.2.  RTCP and RTCP Extended Reports\n   The use of RTCP for reporting is defined\
    \ in [RFC3550].  [RFC3611]\n   defined an extensible structure for reporting using\
    \ an RTCP Extended\n   Report (XR).  This document defines a new Extended Report\
    \ block for\n   use with [RFC3550] and [RFC3611].\n"
- title: 1.3.  Performance Metrics Framework
  contents:
  - "1.3.  Performance Metrics Framework\n   \"Guidelines for Considering New Performance\
    \ Metric Development\"\n   [RFC6390] provides guidance on the definition and specification\
    \ of\n   performance metrics.  \"Guidelines for Use of the RTP Monitoring\n  \
    \ Framework\" [RFC6792] provides guidance for reporting block format\n   using\
    \ RTCP XR.  The metrics block described in this document is in\n   accordance\
    \ with the guidelines in [RFC6390] and [RFC6792].\n"
- title: 1.4.  Applicability
  contents:
  - "1.4.  Applicability\n   This metric is believed to be applicable to a large class\
    \ of RTP\n   applications that use a de-jitter buffer [RFC5481].\n   Discards\
    \ due to late or early arriving packets affect user\n   experience.  The reporting\
    \ of discards alerts senders and other\n   receivers to the need to adjust their\
    \ transmission or reception\n   strategies.  The reports allow network managers\
    \ to diagnose these\n   user experience problems.\n   The ability to detect duplicate\
    \ packets can be used by managers to\n   detect network layer or sender behavior,\
    \ which may indicate network\n   or device issues.  Based on the reports, these\
    \ issues may be\n   addressed prior to any impact on user experience.\n"
- title: 2.  Terminology
  contents:
  - "2.  Terminology\n   The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\"\
    , \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and\
    \ \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC\
    \ 2119 [RFC2119].\n   In addition, the following terms are defined:\n   Received,\
    \ Lost, and Discarded\n      A packet shall be regarded as lost if it fails to\
    \ arrive within an\n      implementation-specific time window.  A packet that\
    \ arrives within\n      this time window but is either too early or too late to\
    \ be played\n      out or is thrown away before playout due to packet duplication\
    \ or\n      redundancy shall be regarded as discarded.  A packet shall not be\n\
    \      regarded as discarded if it arrives within this time window but is\n  \
    \    dropped during decoding by some higher layer decoder, e.g., due to\n    \
    \  a decoding error.  A packet shall be classified as one of the\n      following:\
    \ received (or OK), discarded, or lost.  The discard\n      count metric counts\
    \ only discarded packets.  The metric\n      \"cumulative number of packets lost\"\
    \ defined in [RFC3550] reports a\n      count of packets lost from the media stream\
    \ (single\n      synchronization source (SSRC) within a single RTP session).\n\
    \      Similarly, the metric \"number of packets discarded\" reports a\n     \
    \ count of packets discarded from the media stream (single SSRC\n      within\
    \ a single RTP session) arriving at the receiver.  Another\n      metric defined\
    \ in [RFC5725] is available to report on packets that\n      are not recovered\
    \ by any repair techniques that may be in use.\n"
- title: 3.  Discard Count Metrics Block
  contents:
  - "3.  Discard Count Metrics Block\n   Metrics in this block report on the number\
    \ of packets discarded in\n   the stream arriving at the RTP end system.  The\
    \ measurement of these\n   metrics is made at the receiving end of the RTP stream.\
    \  Instances of\n   this metrics block use the SSRC to refer to the separate auxiliary\n\
    \   Measurement Information Block [RFC6776], which describes measurement\n   periods\
    \ in use (see [RFC6776], Section 4.2).  This metrics block\n   relies on the measurement\
    \ interval in the Measurement Information\n   Block indicating the span of the\
    \ report and MUST be sent in the same\n   compound RTCP packet as the Measurement\
    \ Information Block.  If the\n   measurement interval is not received in the same\
    \ compound RTCP packet\n   as this metrics block, this metrics block MUST be discarded.\n"

- title: 3.2.  Definition of Fields in the Discard Count Metrics Block
  contents:
  - "3.2.  Definition of Fields in the Discard Count Metrics Block\n   Block Type\
    \ (BT): 8 bits\n      A Discard Count Metrics Block is identified by the constant\
    \ 24.\n   Interval Metric flag (I): 2 bits\n      This field indicates whether\
    \ the reported metric is an Interval,\n      Cumulative, or Sampled metric [RFC6792]:\n\
    \         I=10: Interval Duration - the reported value applies to the\n      \
    \   most recent measurement interval duration between successive\n         metrics\
    \ reports.\n         I=11: Cumulative Duration - the reported value applies to\
    \ the\n         accumulation period characteristic of cumulative measurements.\n\
    \         I=01: Sampled Value - the reported value is a sampled\n         instantaneous\
    \ value.\n      In this document, the discard count metric can only be measured\n\
    \      over definite intervals and cannot be sampled.  Accordingly, the\n    \
    \  value I=01, indicating a sampled value, MUST NOT be sent, and MUST\n      be\
    \ discarded when received.  In addition, the value I=00 is\n      reserved and\
    \ also MUST NOT be sent, and MUST be discarded when\n      received.\n   Discard\
    \ Type (DT): 2 bits\n      This field is used to identify the discard type used\
    \ in this\n      report block.  The discard type is defined as follows:\n    \
    \     00: Report packet discarded or being thrown away before playout\n      \
    \   due to packet duplication.\n         01: Report packet discarded due to too\
    \ early to be played out.\n         10: Report packet discarded due to too late\
    \ to be played out.\n      The value DT=11 is reserved for future definition and\
    \ MUST NOT be\n      sent, and MUST be discarded when received.\n      An endpoint\
    \ MAY report any combination of discard types in each\n      reporting interval\
    \ by including several Discard Count Metrics\n      Blocks in a single RTCP XR\
    \ packet.\n      Some systems send duplicate RTP packets for robustness or error\n\
    \      resilience.  This is NOT RECOMMENDED since it breaks RTCP packet\n    \
    \  statistics.  If duplication is desired for error resilience, the\n      mechanism\
    \ described in [RTPDUP] can be used, since this will not\n      cause breakage\
    \ of RTP streams or RTCP statistics.\n   Reserved (resv): 4 bits\n      These\
    \ bits are reserved.  They MUST be set to zero by senders and\n      ignored by\
    \ receivers (see [RFC6709], Section 4.2).\n   Block Length: 16 bits\n      The\
    \ length of this report block in 32-bit words, minus one, in\n      accordance\
    \ with the definition in [RFC3611].  This field MUST be\n      set to 2 to match\
    \ the fixed length of the report block.  The block\n      MUST be discarded if\
    \ the block length is set to a different value.\n   SSRC of Source: 32 bits\n\
    \      As defined in Section 4.1 of [RFC3611].\n   Discard Count\n      Number\
    \ of packets discarded over the period (Interval or\n      Cumulative) covered\
    \ by this report.\n      The measured value is an unsigned value.  If the measured\
    \ value\n      exceeds 0xFFFFFFFD, the value 0xFFFFFFFE MUST be reported to\n\
    \      indicate an over-range measurement.  If the measurement is\n      unavailable,\
    \ the value 0xFFFFFFFF MUST be reported.\n      Note that the number of packets\
    \ expected in the period associated\n      with this metric (whether Interval\
    \ or Cumulative) is available\n      from the difference between a pair of extended\
    \ sequence numbers in\n      the Measurement Information Block [RFC6776], so it\
    \ need not be\n      repeated in this block.\n"

  - "6.  Security Considerations\n   In some situations, returning very detailed error\
    \ information (e.g.,\n   over-range measurement or measurement unavailable) using\
    \ this report\n   block can provide an attacker with insight into the security\n\
    \   processing.  Where this is a concern, the implementation should apply\n  \
    \ encryption and authentication to this report block.  For example,\n   this can\
    \ be achieved by using the Audio-Visual Profile with Feedback\n   (AVPF) profile\
    \ together with the Secure RTP profile, as defined in\n   [RFC3711]; an appropriate\
    \ combination of those two profiles (\"SAVPF\")\n   is specified in [RFC5124].\n\
    \   Besides this, it is believed that this RTCP XR block introduces no\n   new\
    \ security considerations beyond those described in [RFC3611].\n   This block\
    \ does not provide per-packet statistics, so the risk to\n   confidentiality documented\
