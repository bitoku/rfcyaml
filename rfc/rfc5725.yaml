  contents:
  - "Abstract\n   This document defines a new report block type within the framework\
    \ of\n   RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) Extended Reports (XRs).  One of the\n   initial\
    \ XR report block types is the Loss Run Length Encoding (RLE)\n   Report Block.\
    \  This report conveys information regarding the\n   individual Real-time Transport\
    \ Protocol (RTP) packet receipt and loss\n   events experienced during the RTCP\
    \ interval preceding the\n   transmission of the report.  The new report, which\
    \ is referred to as\n   the Post-repair Loss RLE report, carries information regarding\
    \ the\n   packets that remain lost after all loss-repair methods are applied.\n\
    \   By comparing the RTP packet receipts/losses before and after the loss\n  \
    \ repair is completed, one can determine the effectiveness of the loss-\n   repair\
    \ methods in an aggregated fashion.  This document also defines\n   the signaling\
    \ of the Post-repair Loss RLE report in the Session\n   Description Protocol (SDP).\n"

  - "1.  Introduction\n   The RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) is the out-of-band control\
    \ protocol\n   for applications that are using the Real-time Transport Protocol\n\
    \   (RTP) for media delivery and communications [RFC3550].  RTCP allows\n   RTP\
    \ entities to monitor data delivery and provides them minimal\n   control functionality\
    \ via sender and receiver reports as well as\n   other control packets.  [RFC3611]\
    \ expands the RTCP functionality\n   further by introducing the RTCP Extended\
    \ Reports (XRs).\n   One of the initial XR report block types defined in [RFC3611]\
    \ is the\n   Loss Run Length Encoding (RLE) Report Block.  This report conveys\n\
    \   information regarding the individual RTP packet receipt and loss\n   events\
    \ experienced during the RTCP interval preceding the\n   transmission of the report.\
    \  However, the Loss RLE in an RTCP XR\n   report is usually collected only on\
    \ the primary source stream before\n   any loss-repair method is applied.  Once\
    \ one or more loss-repair\n   methods, e.g., Forward Error Correction (FEC) [RFC5109]\
    \ and/or\n   retransmission [RFC4588], are applied, some or all of the lost\n\
    \   packets on the primary source stream may be recovered.  However, the\n   pre-repair\
    \ Loss RLE cannot indicate which source packets were\n   recovered and which are\
    \ still missing.  Thus, the pre-repair Loss RLE\n   cannot specify how well the\
    \ loss repair performed.\n   This issue can be addressed by generating an additional\
    \ report block\n   (within the same or a different RTCP XR report), which reflects\
    \ the\n   packet receipt/loss events after all loss-repair methods are applied.\n\
    \   This report block, which we refer to as the post-repair Loss RLE,\n   indicates\
    \ the remaining missing, i.e., unrepairable, source packets.\n   When the pre-repair\
    \ and post-repair Loss RLEs are compared, the RTP\n   sender or another third-party\
    \ entity can evaluate the effectiveness\n   of the loss-repair methods in an aggregated\
    \ fashion.  To avoid any\n   ambiguity in the evaluation, it is RECOMMENDED that\
    \ the post-repair\n   Loss RLE be generated for the source packets that have no\
    \ further\n   chance of being repaired.  If the loss-repair method(s) may still\n\
    \   recover one or more missing source packets, the post-repair Loss RLE\n   SHOULD\
    \ NOT be sent until the loss-recovery process has been\n   completed.  However,\
    \ a potential ambiguity may result from sequence-\n   number wrapping in the primary\
    \ source stream.  Thus, the Post-repair\n   Loss RLE reports may not be delayed\
    \ arbitrarily.  In case of an\n   ambiguity in the incoming reports, it is the\
    \ sender's or the\n   monitoring entity's responsibility to understand which packets\
    \ the\n   Post-repair Loss RLE report is related to.\n   Similar to the pre-repair\
    \ Loss RLE, the post-repair Loss RLE conveys\n   the receipt/loss events at the\
    \ packet level and considers partially\n   repaired packets as unrepaired.  Thus,\
    \ the methods that can partially\n   recover the missing data SHOULD NOT be evaluated\
    \ based on the\n   information provided by the Post-repair Loss RLE reports since\
    \ such\n   information may underestimate the effectiveness of such methods.\n\
    \   Note that the idea of using pre-repair and post-repair Loss RLEs can\n   be\
    \ further extended when multiple sequential loss-repair methods are\n   applied\
    \ to the primary source stream.  Reporting the Loss RLEs before\n   and after\
    \ each loss-repair method can provide specific information\n   about the individual\
    \ performances of these methods.  However, it can\n   be a difficult task to quantify\
    \ the specific contribution made by\n   each loss-repair method in hybrid systems,\
    \ where different methods\n   collectively work together to repair the lost source\
    \ packets.  Thus,\n   in this specification we only consider reporting the Loss\
    \ RLE after\n   all loss-repair methods have been applied.\n   This document registers\
    \ a new report block type to cover the post-\n   repair Loss RLE within the framework\
    \ of RTCP XR.  Applications that\n   are employing one or more loss-repair methods\
    \ MAY use Post-repair\n   Loss RLE reports for every packet they receive or for\
    \ a set of\n   specific packets they have received.  In other words, the coverage\
    \ of\n   the post-repair Loss RLEs may or may not be contiguous.\n"

    \  every 32,768 (amounting to two packets within each 16-bit sequence\n      space).\n\
    \      If thinning is desired, it is RECOMMENDED to use the same thinning\n  \
    \    value in the Pre-repair and Post-repair Loss RLE reports.  This\n      will\
    \ allow easier report processing and correlation.  However,\n      based on the\

    \   Note that the sequence numbers that are included in the report refer\n   to\
    \ the primary source stream.\n   When using Post-repair Loss RLE reports, the\

- title: 5.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "5.  Security Considerations\n   The security considerations of [RFC3611] apply\
    \ in this document as\n   well.  Additional security considerations are briefly\
    \ mentioned\n   below.\n   An attacker who monitors the regular Pre-repair Loss\
    \ RLE reports sent\n   by a group of receivers in the same multicast distribution\
    \ network\n   may infer the network characteristics (Multicast Inference of Network\n\
    \   Characteristics).  However, monitoring the Post-repair Loss RLE\n   reports\
    \ will not reveal any further information about the network.\n   Without the regular\
    \ Pre-repair Loss RLE reports, the Post-repair ones\n   will not be any use to\
    \ attackers.  Even when used with the regular\n   Pre-repair Loss RLE reports,\
    \ the Post-repair Loss RLE reports only\n   reveal the effectiveness of the repair\
    \ process.  However, this does\n   not enable any new attacks, nor does it provide\
    \ information to an\n   attacker that could not be similarly obtained by watching\
    \ the RTP\n   packets fly by himself, performing the repair algorithms and\n \
    \  computing the desired output.\n   An attacker may interfere with the repair\
    \ process for an RTP stream.\n   In that case, if the attacker is able to see\
    \ the post-repair Loss\n   RLEs, the attacker may infer whether or not the attack\
    \ is effective.\n   If not, the attacker may continue attacking or alter the attack.\
    \  In\n   practice, however, this does not pose a security risk.\n   An attacker\
    \ may put incorrect information in the regular Pre-repair\n   and Post-repair\
    \ Loss RLE reports such that it impacts the proactive\n   decisions made by the\
    \ sender in the repair process or the reactive\n   decisions when responding to\
    \ the feedback messages coming from the\n   receiver.  A sender application should\
    \ be aware of such risks and\n   should take the necessary precautions to minimize\
    \ the chances for\n   (or, better, eliminate) such attacks.\n   Similar to other\
    \ RTCP XR reports, the Post-repair Loss RLE reports\n   MAY be protected by using\
    \ the Secure RTP (SRTP) and Secure RTP\n   Control Protocol (SRTCP) [RFC3711].\n"
