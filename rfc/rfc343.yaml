  - "                     IMP System Change Notification\n   As most of you probably\
    \ know, our attempt to release IMPSYS 2600 on\n   May 15 (as discussed in RFC\
    \ #331) was unsuccessful.  Briefly, the\n   primary reasons for failure (all operational\
    \ rather than programming\n   bugs) were:\n      1) The network appears to have\
    \ grown too large for us to\n         successfully coordinate operator intervention\
    \ at all sites.\n      2) An unanticipated aspect of the gradual release of the\
    \ new\n         system was the \"poisoning\" of IMP's running the new system by\n\
    \         adjacent IMP's running the old system, and vice versa.  Working\n  \
    \       around this problem made the dissemination of the new system\n       \
    \  take much longer than anticipated.\n   We believe we see solutions to both\
    \ of these problems and are now\n   ready to schedule the next attempt(s) to release\
    \ IMPSYS 2600.  We\n   hereby request all sites to cooperate with this effort\
    \ in the\n   following ways.\n"

    \ Nevertheless, we are not omniscient and may again be thwarted by\n     difficulties.\
    \  Accordingly, we are scheduling the next attempt for\n     Wednesday, May 31,\
    \ and subsequently every Tuesday (June 6, 13, 20,\n     ...) until the release\
    \ is successfully accomplished.  We will\n     arrange the release process so\
    \ that site operator coverage is not\n     required; nevertheless we hope that\
    \ the normal site operator\n     coverage is available in case unanticipated problems\
    \ develop.\n     Release of the new system will begin early in the day\n     (approximately\
    \ 7 a.m. EDT).  We again suggest that sites do not\n     schedule production work\
    \ over the network during the release\n     attempt(s).  We will notify each site\
    \ by phone after the release\n     has been successfully completed.\n     Finally,\
    \ we apologize in advance for any inconvenience caused by\n     the contortions\
    \ required to release this new system, and thank all\n     of the site operations'\
    \ staffs who worked with us on May 15 for\n     their cooperation.\n     AAM/jm\n\
