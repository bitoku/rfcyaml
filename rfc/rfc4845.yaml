- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   From time to time, the IAB has cause to publish documents\
    \ as Requests\n   for Comments (RFCs).  These occasions include the following:\n\
    \   o  documents that arise from consideration of an issue by the IAB and\n  \
    \    are authored by the IAB through a nominated editor.\n   o  documents that\
    \ report on IAB activities, such as workshop reports,\n      and are authored\
    \ by a nominated editor, generally from among the\n      activity participants.\n\
    \   o  documents that are not the outcome of an Internet Engineering Task\n  \
    \    Force (IETF) Working Group effort but that the IAB has determined\n     \
    \ would be of benefit to the IETF community to publish.  Such\n      documents\
    \ need not necessarily be authored or revised by the IAB.\n   The majority of\
    \ documents published by the IAB will be classified as\n   Informational RFCs\
    \ (see [RFC2026]).  Generally speaking, the IAB does\n   not publish Standards-Track\
    \ or Experimental RFCs.  If the IAB has\n   cause to publish a document as a Best\
    \ Current Practice (BCP), it\n   would fall under the approval process of the\
    \ IETF standards stream of\n   RFCs (see [RFC4844]).\n"
- title: 2.  Review and Approval
  contents:
  - "2.  Review and Approval\n   In many cases, the IAB publishes documents to provide\
    \ a permanent\n   record of an IAB statement or position.  In such cases, the\
    \ IAB uses\n   its internal discussion processes to refine the expression and\n\
    \   technical content of the document, and the document is approved for\n   publication\
    \ if, and only if, the IAB is in agreement on its\n   substantive content.\n \
    \  For certain documents, it may not be appropriate for the IAB to take\n   responsibility\
    \ for technical correctness.  For example, where the IAB\n   has sponsored a workshop\
    \ in which not all the participants were\n   members of the IAB and/or not all\
    \ the members of the IAB were\n   present, approval by the IAB of a report of\
    \ the workshop is used only\n   to assert that the report is a faithful report\
    \ of the proceedings of\n   the workshop and that the matter is of interest to\
    \ the community.\n   Documents for which the IAB takes responsibility for technical\n\
    \   correctness (the most usual case) will be indicated by noting the IAB\n  \
    \ as an author of the document, with individuals noted as editors or\n   text\
    \ authors.  Other documents, such as workshop reports, will not\n   specify the\
    \ IAB as an author (although this does not preclude\n   individual IAB members\
    \ from being authors or editors).\n   In general, the document (introductory)\
    \ text should make plain the\n   role of the IAB in publishing and supporting\
    \ the text.  Should the\n   IAB have significant issues with any individual item\
    \ in the document,\n   a note may be included in the document explaining the issue.\n"
- title: 3.  IAB RFC Publication Process
  contents:
  - "3.  IAB RFC Publication Process\n   The following is a description of the process\
    \ used by the IAB to\n   publish IAB documents as RFCs.\n   1.  The document is\
    \ determined to be an IAB document by the IAB, as\n       described in Section\
    \ 1.\n   2.  The IAB publishes an IAB draft (draft-iab-*).  Comments on the\n\
    \       draft are reviewed and may be integrated into successive\n       iterations\
    \ of the draft.  In addition to considering comments\n       received on the draft,\
    \ the IAB may elect to refer the document to\n       individuals or groups and\
    \ explicitly solicit comments as\n       appropriate.\n   3.  For documents intended\
    \ to be published as BCPs, the document is\n       passed to the Internet Engineering\
    \ Steering Group (IESG) with a\n       sponsoring Area Director (AD), and follows\
    \ the process outlined\n       in [SPONSOR].\n   4.  For documents intended to\
    \ be Informational RFCs, the remainder of\n       this process is followed.\n\
    \   5.  The chair of the IAB issues an IETF-wide Call for Comment on the\n   \
    \    IETF Announce mailing list.  The comment period is normally no\n       shorter\
    \ than four weeks.\n   6.  Comments received are considered for integration into\
    \ the\n       document.  The IAB shall determine whether the document is ready\n\
    \       for publication based on the comments received, or whether\n       another\
    \ round of document editing and, optionally, a further call\n       for input\
    \ is required.\n   7.  The document is passed to the RFC Editor for publication\
    \ as an\n       IAB document Informational RFC.\n"
