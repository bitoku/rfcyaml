  - "Abstract\n   This memo describes a new IPv6 Hop-by-Hop Option type that alerts\n
    \  transit routers to more closely examine the contents of an IP\n   datagram.
    \ This option is useful for situations where a datagram\n   addressed to a particular
    destination contains information that may\n   require special processing by routers
    along the path.\n"
  title: Abstract
- contents:
  - "1.0  Introduction\n   New protocols, such as RSVP, use control datagrams which,
    while\n   addressed to a particular destination, contain information that needs\n
    \  to be examined, and in some case updated, by routers along the path\n   between
    the source and destination.  It is desirable to forward\n   regular datagrams
    as rapidly as possible, while ensuring that the\n   router processes these special
    control datagrams appropriately.\n   Currently, however, the only way for a router
    to determine if it\n   needs to examine a datagram is to at least partially parse
    upper\n   layer data in all datagrams.  This parsing is expensive and slow.\n
    \  This situation is undesirable.\n   This document defines a new option within
    the IPv6 Hop-by-Hop Header.\n   The presence of this option in an IPv6 datagram
    informs the router\n   that the contents of this datagram is of interest to the
    router and\n   to handle any control data accordingly.  The absence of this option\n
    \  in an IPv6 datagram informs the router that the datagram does not\n   contain
    information needed by the router and hence can be safely\n   routed without further
    datagram parsing.  Hosts originating IPv6\n   datagrams are required to include
    this option in certain\n   circumstances.\n   The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\",
    \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\",
    \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n   document are to be interpreted as described
    in [RFC-2119].\n"
  title: 1.0  Introduction
- contents:
  - "2.0  Approach\n   The goal is to provide an efficient mechanism whereby routers
    can\n   know when to intercept datagrams not addressed to them without having\n
    \  to extensively examine every datagram.  The described solution is to\n   define
    a new IPv6 Hop-by-Hop Header option having the semantic\n   \"routers should examine
    this datagram more closely\" and require\n   protocols such as RSVP to use this
    option.  This approach incurs\n   little or no performance penalty on the forwarding
    of normal\n   datagrams.  Not including this option tells the router that there
    is\n   no need to closely examine the contents of the datagram.\n"
  title: 2.0  Approach
- contents:
  - "2.1  Syntax\n   The router alert option has the following format:\n   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+\n
    \  |0 0 0|0 0 1 0 1|0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0|        Value (2 octets)       |\n   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+\n
    \                     length = 2\n      The first three bits of the first byte
    are zero and the value 5 in\n      the remaining five bits is the Hop-by-Hop Option
    Type number.\n      [RFC-2460] specifies the meaning of the first three bits.
    \ By\n      zeroing all three, this specification requires that nodes not\n      recognizing
    this option type should skip over this option and\n      continue processing the
    header and that the option must not change\n      en route.\n      There MUST
    only be one option of this type, regardless of value,\n      per Hop-by-Hop header.\n
    \     Value:  A 2 octet code in network byte order with the following\n      values:\n
    \        0        Datagram contains a Multicast Listener Discovery\n                  message
    [RFC-2710].\n         1        Datagram contains RSVP message.\n         2        Datagram
    contains an Active Networks message.\n         3-65535  Reserved to IANA for future
    use.\n      Alignment requirement: 2n+0\n      Values are registered and maintained
    by the IANA.  See section 5.0\n      for more details.\n"
  title: 2.1  Syntax
- contents:
  - "2.2  Semantics\n   The option indicates that the contents of the datagram may
    be\n   interesting to the router.  The router's interest and the actions\n   taken
    by employing Router Alert MUST be specified in the RFC of the\n   protocol that
    mandates or allows the use of Router Alert.\n   The final destination of the IPv6
    datagram MUST ignore this option\n   upon receipt to prevent multiple evaluations
    of the datagram.\n   Unrecognized value fields MUST be silently ignored and the
    processing\n   of the header continued.\n   Routers that recognize the option
    will examine datagrams carrying it\n   more closely to determine whether or not
    further processing is\n   necessary.  The router only needs to parse the packet
    in sufficient\n   detail to decide whether the packet contains something of interest.\n
    \  The value field can be used by an implementation to speed processing\n   of
    the datagram within the transit router.\n   Observe that further processing can
    involve protocol layers above\n   IPv6.  E.g., for RSVP messages, the datagram
    will have to undergo UDP\n   and RSVP protocol processing.  Once the datagram
    leaves the IPv6\n   layer, there is considerable ambiguity about whether the router
    is\n   acting as an IPv6 host or an IPv6 router.  Precisely how the router\n   handles
    the contents is value-field specific.  However, if the\n   processing required
    for the datagram involves examining the payload\n   of the IPv6 datagram, then
    the interim router is performing a host\n   function and SHOULD interpret the
    data as a host.\n"
  title: 2.2  Semantics
- contents:
  - "3.0  Impact on Other Protocols\n   For this option to be effective, its use MUST
    be mandated in\n   protocols that expect routers to perform significant processing
    on\n   datagrams not directly addressed to them.  Routers are not required\n   to
    examine the datagrams not addressed to them unless the datagrams\n   include the
    router alert option.\n   All IPv6 datagrams containing an RSVP message MUST contain
    this\n   option within the IPv6 Hop-by-Hop Options Header of such datagrams.\n"
  title: 3.0  Impact on Other Protocols
- contents:
  - "4.0  Security Considerations\n   Gratuitous use of this option can cause performance
    problems in\n   routers.  A more severe attack is possible in which the router
    is\n   flooded by bogus datagrams containing router alert options.\n   The use
    of the option, if supported in a router, MAY therefore be\n   limited by rate
    or other means by the transit router.\n"

  - "5.0 IANA Considerations\n   The value field described in Section 2.1 is registered
    and maintained\n   by IANA. New values are to be assigned via IETF Consensus as
