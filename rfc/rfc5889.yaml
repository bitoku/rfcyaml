  - "1.  Introduction\n   The appropriate configuration of IP addresses and subnet\
    \ masks for\n   router network interfaces is generally a prerequisite to the correct\n\
    \   functioning of routing protocols.  Consideration of various items,\n   including\
    \ underlying link capabilities and connectivity, geographical\n   topology, available\
    \ address blocks, assumed traffic patterns etc.,\n   are used when determining\
    \ the appropriate network topology and the\n   associated IP interface configuration.\n\
    \   When the capabilities and connectivity of the links that connect\n   routers\
    \ are well-known and stable, logical network topology design\n   and corresponding\
    \ IP interface configuration are straightforward.\n   Absent any assumption about\
    \ link-level connectivity, however, there\n   is no canonical method for determining\
    \ a given IP interface\n   configuration.\n   Link-level connectivity is generally\
    \ qualified as undetermined when\n   it is unplanned and/or time-varying in character.\
    \  Ad hoc networks\n   are typical examples of networks with undetermined link-level\n\
    \   connectivity.  Routing protocols for ad hoc networks are purposely\n   designed\
    \ to detect and maintain paths across the network, even when\n   faced with links\
    \ with undetermined connectivity, assuming that\n   routers' interfaces are configured\
    \ with IP addresses.  This document\n   thus proposes a model for configuration\
    \ of IP addresses and subnet\n   prefixes on router interfaces to links with undetermined\
    \ connectivity\n   properties, to allow routing protocols and data packet forwarding\
    \ to\n   function.\n   Note that routers may ultimately need additional IP prefixes\
    \ for the\n   diverse applications that could run directly on the routers\n  \
    \ themselves, or for assignment to attached hosts or networks.  For\n   IPv6,\
    \ these addresses may be global [RFC3587], Unique-Local [RFC4193]\n   or Link-Local\
    \ [RFC4291].  For IPv4, the addresses may be global\n   (i.e., public) or private\
    \ [RFC1918].  In general, global scope is\n   desired over local scope, though\
    \ it is understood that this may not\n   always be achievable via automatic configuration\
    \ mechanisms.  In this\n   document however, automatic configuration of the prefixes\
    \ used for\n   general applications is considered as a problem that is separable\n\
    \   from that of automatic configuration of addresses and prefixes\n   necessary\
    \ for routing protocols to function.  This document thus\n   focuses on the latter:\
    \ the type of IP address and subnet mask\n   configuration necessary for routing\
    \ protocols and data packet\n   forwarding to function.\n"
- title: 2.  Terminology
  contents:
  - "2.  Terminology\n   This document uses the vocabulary and the concepts defined\
    \ in\n   [RFC1918] and [RFC4632] for IPv4, as well as [RFC4291] for IPv6.\n"
- title: 3.  Applicability Statement
  contents:
  - "3.  Applicability Statement\n   This model gives guidance about the configuration\
    \ of IP addresses and\n   the IP subnet prefixes on a router's IP interfaces,\
    \ which connect to\n   links with undetermined connectivity properties.\n   When\
    \ more specific assumptions can be made regarding the connectivity\n   between\
    \ interfaces or the (persistent) reachability of some\n   addresses, these should\
    \ be considered when configuring subnet\n   prefixes.\n"
- title: 4.  IP Subnet Prefix Configuration
  contents:
  - "4.  IP Subnet Prefix Configuration\n   If the link to which an interface connects\
    \ enables no assumptions of\n   connectivity to other interfaces, the only addresses\
    \ that can be\n   assumed \"on link\", are the address(es) of that interface itself.\n\
    \   Note that while link-local addresses are assumed to be \"on link\", the\n\
    \   utility of link-local addresses is limited as described in Section 6.\n  \
    \ Thus, subnet prefix configuration on such interfaces must not make\n   any promises\
    \ in terms of direct (one hop) IP connectivity to IP\n   addresses other than\
    \ that of the interface itself.  This suggests the\n   following principle:\n\
    \   o  no on-link subnet prefix should be configured on such an\n      interface.\n\
    \   Note that if layer 2 communication is enabled between a pair of\n   interfaces,\
    \ IP packet exchange is also enabled, even if IP subnet\n   configuration is absent\
    \ or different on each of these interfaces.\n   Also note that if, on the contrary,\
    \ assumptions can be made regarding\n   the connectivity between interfaces, or\
    \ regarding the persistent\n   reachability of some addresses, these should be\
    \ considered when\n   configuring IP subnet prefixes, and the corresponding interface(s)\n\
    \   may in such case be configured with an on-link subnet prefix.\n"
- title: 5.  IP Address Configuration
  contents:
  - "5.  IP Address Configuration\n   Routing protocols running on a router may exhibit\
    \ different\n   requirements for uniqueness of interface addresses; some have\
    \ no such\n   requirements, others have requirements ranging from local uniqueness\n\
    \   only, to uniqueness within, at least, the routing domain (as defined\n   in\
    \ [RFC1136]).\n   Routing protocols that do not require unique IP addresses within\
    \ the\n   routing domain utilize a separate unique identifier within the\n   routing\
    \ protocol itself; such identifiers could be based on factory\n   assignment or\
    \ configuration.\n   Nevertheless, configuring an IP address that is unique within\
    \ the\n   routing domain satisfies the less stringent uniqueness requirements,\n\
    \   while also enabling protocols that have the most stringent\n   requirements\
    \ of uniqueness within the routing domain.  As a result,\n   the following principle\
    \ allows for IP autoconfiguration to apply to\n   the widest array of routing\
    \ protocols:\n   o  an IP address assigned to an interface that connects to a\
    \ link\n      with undetermined connectivity properties should be unique, at\n\
    \      least within the routing domain.\n"
- title: 6.  Addressing Model
  contents:
  - "6.  Addressing Model\n   Sections 4 and 5 describe principles for IP address\
    \ and subnet prefix\n   configuration on an interface of a router, when that interface\n\
    \   connects to a link with undetermined connectivity properties.  The\n   following\
    \ describes guidelines that follow from these principles,\n   respectively for\
    \ IPv6 and IPv4.\n   Note that the guidelines provided in this document slightly\
    \ differ\n   for IPv6 and IPv4, as IPv6 offers possibilities that IPv4 does not\n\
    \   (i.e., the possibility to simply not configure any on-link subnet\n   prefix\
    \ on an IPv6 interface), which provide a \"cleaner\" model.\n"
- title: 6.1.  IPv6 Model
  contents:
  - "6.1.  IPv6 Model\n   For IPv6, the principles described in Sections 4 and 5 suggest\
    \ the\n   following rules:\n   o  An IP address configured on this interface should\
    \ be unique, at\n      least within the routing domain, and\n   o  No on-link\
    \ subnet prefix is configured on this interface.\n   Note that while an IPv6 link-local\
    \ address is assigned to each\n   interface as per [RFC4291], in general link-local\
    \ addresses are of\n   limited utility on links with undetermined connectivity,\
    \ as\n   connectivity to neighbors may be constantly changing.  The known\n  \
    \ limitations are:\n   o  In general, there is no mechanism to ensure that IPv6\
    \ link-local\n      addresses are unique across multiple links, though link-local\n\
    \      addresses using an IID that are of the modified EUI-64 form should\n  \
    \    be globally unique.\n   o  Routers cannot forward any packets with link-local\
    \ source or\n      destination addresses to other links (as per [RFC4291]), while\n\
    \      most of the time, routers need to be able to forward packets to/\n    \
    \  from different links.\n   Therefore, autoconfiguration solutions should be\
    \ encouraged to\n   primarily focus on configuring IP addresses that are not IPv6\
    \ link-\n   local.\n"
- title: 6.2.  IPv4 Model
  contents:
  - "6.2.  IPv4 Model\n   For IPv4, the principles described in Sections 4 and 5 suggest\
    \ rules\n   similar to those mentioned for IPv6 in Section 6.1, that are:\n  \
    \ o  An IP address configured on this interface should be unique, at\n      least\
    \ within the routing domain, and\n   o  Any subnet prefix configured on this interface\
    \ should be 32 bits\n      long.\n   Note that the use of IPv4 link-local addresses\
    \ [RFC3927] in this\n   context should be discouraged for most applications, as\
    \ the\n   limitations outlined in Section 6.1 for IPv6 link-local addresses\n\
    \   also concern IPv4 link-local addresses.  These limitations are\n   further\
    \ exacerbated by the smaller pool of IPv4 link-local addresses\n   to choose from\
    \ and thus increased reliance on Duplicate Address\n   Detection (DAD).\n"
- title: 7.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "7.  Security Considerations\n   This document focuses on the IP address and subnet\
    \ mask configuration\n   necessary for routing protocols and data packet forwarding\
    \ to\n   function.  [RFC4593] describes generic threats to routing protocols,\n\
    \   whose applicability is not altered by the presence of interfaces with\n  \
    \ undetermined connectivity properties.  As such, the addressing model\n   described\
    \ in this document does not introduce new security threats.\n   However, the possible\
    \ lack of pre-established infrastructure or\n   authority, as enabled by the use\
    \ of interfaces with undetermined\n   connectivity properties, may render some\
    \ of the attacks described in\n   [RFC4593] easier to undertake.  In particular,\
    \ detection of\n   malevolent misconfiguration may be more difficult to detect\
    \ and to\n   locate.\n"
