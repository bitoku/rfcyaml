Abstract This MIB module defines textual conventions to represent Facility and Severity information commonly used in syslog messages.
The intent is that these textual conventions will be imported and used in MIB modules that would otherwise define their own representations.
The Internet Standard Management Framework
For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current Internet Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of RFC 3410 [RFC3410].
Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed the Management Information Base or MIB.
MIB objects are generally accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the Structure of Management Information (SMI).
This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58, RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58
, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
Background Operating systems, processes, and applications, collectively termed "Facilities" in the following, generate messages indicating their own status or the occurrence of events.
These messages have come to be known as syslog messages.
A syslog message in general will contain among other things a code representing the Facility that generated the message and a code representing the Severity of the message.
The Facility and the Severity codes are commonly used to categorize and select received syslog messages for processing and display.
The Facility codes have been useful in qualifying the originator of the content of the messages but in some cases they are not specific enough to explicitly identify the originator.
Implementations of the syslog protocol [RFC5424] that contain structured data elements (SDEs) should use these SDEs to clarify the entity that originated the content of the message.
This document defines a set of textual conventions (TCs) that can be used to represent Facility and Severity codes commonly used in syslog messages.
The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119

"This textual convention enumerates the Facilities that originate syslog messages.
The Facilities of syslog messages are numerically coded with decimal values.
For interoperability and backwards  compatibility reasons, this document specifies a normative mapping between a label, which represents a Facility, and the corresponding numeric value.
This label could be used in, for example, SNMP Manager user interfaces.
The label itself is often semantically meaningless because it is impractical to attempt to enumerate all possible Facilities, and many daemons and processes do not have an explicitly assigned Facility code or label.
For example, there is no Facility label corresponding to an HTTP service.
An HTTP service implementation might log messages as coming from, for example, 'local7' or 'uucp'.
This is typical current practice, and originators, relays, and collectors can be configured to properly handle this situation.
For improved accuracy, an application can also include an APP NAME structured data element.
Note that operating system mechanisms for configuring syslog, such as syslog.conf, have not yet been standardized and might use different sets of Facility labels and/or mapping between Facility labels and Facility codes than the MIB.
In particular, the labels corresponding to Facility codes 4, 10, 13, and 14, and the code corresponding to the Facility label 'cron' are known to vary across different operating systems.
To distinguish between the labels corresponding to Facility codes 9 and 15, a label of 'cron2' is assigned to the Facility code 15.
This list is not intended to be exhaustive; other differences might exist, and new differences might be introduced in the future.
The mapping specified here MUST be used in a MIB network management interface, even though a particular syslog implementation might use a different mapping in a different network management interface.
" REFERENCE "The Syslog Protocol (RFC5424):
"This textual convention enumerates the Severity levels of syslog messages.
The Severity levels of syslog messages are numerically coded with decimal values.
For interoperability and backwards compatibility reasons, this document specifies a normative mapping between a label, which represents a Severity level, and the corresponding numeric value.
This label could be used in, for example, SNMP Manager user interfaces.
The label itself is often semantically meaningless because it is impractical to attempt to strictly define the criteria for each Severity level, and the criteria that is used by syslog originators is, and has historically been, implementation dependent.
Note that operating system mechanisms for configuring syslog, such as syslog.conf, have not yet been standardized and might use different sets of Severity labels and/or mapping between Severity labels and Severity codes than the MIB.
For example, the foobar application might log messages as 'crit' based on some subjective criteria.
Yet the operator can configure syslog to forward these messages, even though the criteria for 'crit' may differ from one originator to another.
This is typical current practice, and originators, relays, and collectors can be configured to properly handle this situation.
" REFERENCE "The Syslog Protocol (RFC5424):
This module does not define any management objects.
Instead, it defines a set of textual conventions which may be used by other MIB modules to define management objects.
Meaningful security considerations can only be written in the MIB modules that define management objects.
This document has therefore no impact on the security of the Internet.
Since objects defined using the TCs defined in this document may introduce security issues, the user of these TCs should read the security considerations section of [RFC5424].
The MIB modules in this document use the following IANA assigned OBJECT IDENTIFIER values recorded in the SMI Numbers registry:
{ mib 2 173 }
