- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   [AUTHRES] defined a new header field for electronic mail\
    \ messages\n   that presents the results of a message authentication effort in\
    \ a\n   machine-readable format.  In the interim, a proposal for rudimentary\n\
    \   domain-level reputation assessment, called Vouch By Reference, [VBR]\n   was\
    \ published and is now beginning to see popular use.\n   This memo thus registers\
    \ an additional reporting property allowing a\n   VBR result to be relayed as\
    \ an annotation in a message header.\n"
- title: 2.  Keywords
  contents:
  - "2.  Keywords\n   The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\"\
    , \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and\
    \ \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n   document are to be interpreted as described in [KEYWORDS].\n"
- title: 3.  Discussion
  contents:
  - "3.  Discussion\n   Vouch By Reference [VBR] introduced a mechanism by which a\
    \ message\n   receiver can query a \"vouching\" service to determine whether or\
    \ not a\n   trusted third party is willing to state that mail from a particular\n\
    \   source can be considered legitimate.  When this assessment is done at\n  \
    \ an inbound border mail gateway, it would be useful to relay the\n   result of\
    \ that assessment to internal mail entities such as filters\n   or user agents.\n\
    \   Reactions to the information contained in an Authentication-Results\n   header\
    \ field that contains VBR (or any) results are not specified\n   here, as they\
    \ are entirely a matter of local policy at the receiver.\n"
- title: 4.  Definition
  contents:
  - "4.  Definition\n   This memo adds to the \"Email Authentication Methods\" registry,\n\
    \   created by IANA upon publication of [AUTHRES], the following:\n   o  The method\
    \ \"vbr\"; and\n   o  Associated with that method, the properties (reporting items)\n\
    \      \"header.md\" and \"header.mv\".\n   If \"header.md\" is present, its value\
    \ MUST be the DNS domain name\n   about which a VBR query was made.  If \"header.mv\"\
    \ is present, its\n   value MUST be the DNS domain name that was queried as the\
    \ potential\n   voucher for the \"header.md\" domain.\n   If the VBR query was\
    \ made based on the content of a \"VBR-Info\" header\n   field present on an incoming\
    \ message, \"header.md\" is typically taken\n   from the \"md\" tag of the \"\
    VBR-Info\" header field, and \"header.mv\" is\n   typically one of the values\
    \ of the \"mv\" tag in the \"VBR-Info\" header\n   field on that message.  However,\
    \ [VBR] permits a different mechanism\n   for selection of the subject domain\
    \ and/or list of vouchers, ignoring\n   those present in any \"VBR-Info\" header\
    \ field the message might have\n   included.  A server could even conduct a VBR\
    \ query when no \"VBR-Info\"\n   field was present, based on locally configured\
    \ policy options.  Where\n   such mechanisms are applied, the verifying server\
    \ MAY generate an\n   Authentication-Results field to relay the results of the\
    \ VBR query.\n   This memo also adds to the \"Email Authentication Result Names\"\
    \n   registry the following result codes and definitions:\n   none:  No valid\
    \ VBR-Info header was found in the message, or a domain\n      name to be queried\
    \ could not be determined.\n   pass:  A VBR query was completed, and the vouching\
    \ service queried\n      gave a positive response.\n   fail:  A VBR query was\
    \ completed, and the vouching service queried\n      did not give a positive response,\
    \ or the message contained\n      multiple VBR-Info header fields with different\
    \ \"mc\" values\n      (see [VBR]).\n   temperror:  A VBR query was attempted\
    \ but could not be completed due\n      to some error that is likely transient\
    \ in nature, such as a\n      temporary DNS error.  A later attempt may produce\
    \ a final result.\n   permerror:  A VBR query was attempted but could not be completed\
    \ due\n      to some error that is likely not transient in nature, such as a\n\
    \      permanent DNS error.  A later attempt is unlikely to produce a\n      final\
    \ result.\n"
