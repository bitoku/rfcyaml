  - "Discussion\n   As a result of the NREN NIS award by National Science Foundation,\n\
    \   non-DDN registration services will soon be transferred from the DDN\n   NIC\
    \ to the new Internet Registration Service, which is a part of an\n   entity referred\
    \ to as the InterNIC.  References in this document to\n   the InterNIC apply to\
    \ the Registration Services portion only.\n   Internet registration services are\
    \ gradually transitioning to the\n   InterNIC.  We expect that the full transition\
    \ will be accomplished by\n   April 1, 1993.  During this transitional period,\
    \ EMail, Fax, and U.S.\n   mail received at either site will be processed.  DDN\
    \ users will\n   continue to receive full registration support from the DDN NIC,\
    \ and\n   the transition should be transparent to them.  DDN users should\n  \
    \ continue to send registration requests to hostmast@nic.ddn.mil (IP,\n   .mil\
    \ domain, inaddr for 26.x.x.x) or registrar@nic.ddn.mil (user\n   registrations\
    \ or TAC card requests) using the DISA approved\n   registration forms.\n   From\
    \ now through March 31, 1993, non-DDN Internet registration\n   requests will\
    \ be handled as follows:\n      The current DDN NIC registration templates may\
    \ be filled out and\n      submitted to either hostmaster@internic.net or\n  \
    \    hostmaster@nic.ddn.mil through March 31.  The new InterNIC\n      templates\
    \ will be accepted effective April 1, 1993, but not until\n      that time.\n\

    \            Chantilly, VA 2200\n   Effective April 1, 1993, non-DDN Internet\
    \ requests will be handled as\n   described below.\n      New registration requests\
    \ should be sent to autoreg@internic.net\n      using the new template.  Old templates\
    \ sent to\n      autoreg@internic.net will be returned with the parsing error\n\
    \      messages and the new form attached. Old templates mailed to\n      hostmaster@interic.net\
    \ will be accepted through June 30, 1993.\n      After that date, templates in\
    \ the old format will be returned to\n      the sender with the new template attached.\n\

    \   In an effort to keep those who are likely to submit a high volume of\n   registration\
    \ requests informed during the transition period,\n   information regarding Internet\
    \ registration issues will be\n   distributed via the mail list rs-info@internic.net.\
    \  Send\n   subscription requests to:\n                     rs-info-request@internic.net.\n\
    \   Information on the location of the new autoreg templates and how to\n   retrieve\
    \ them will be sent to those who have subscribed to this list.\n   Comments are\
    \ solicited.  The new registration templates have been\n   modified to facilitate\
    \ automatic processing and to remove all DDN-\n   specific references.\n   WHOIS\
    \ services will be available at both the DDN NIC and InterNIC\n   sites:\n   \
    \  whois.nic.ddn.mil (192.112.36.5)\n     whois.internic.net (198.41.0.5)\n  \
    \ Effective April 1, 1993, only DDN information will be available from\n   whois.nic.ddn.mil.\
    \  The WHOIS service available from\n   whois.internic.net will contain all information\
    \ on IP addresses,\n   domains, and ASNs.  The WHOIS service available from the\n\
    \   whois.internic.net will contain individual user records only for\n   those\
    \ who serve as a Point of Contact for an active node.  Those who\n   are interested\
    \ in establishing a whois service for information on\n   individual users (e.g.,\
    \ for Internet hosts or campus networks) are\n   encouraged to participate in\
    \ one of the many distributed WHOIS-like\n   information projects.\n   Root zone\
    \ files will be available at both sites through March 31,\n   1993.  After that\
    \ time, the root zone file will be available only\n   from ftp.rs.internic.net.\n\
    \   After the transition, the host.txt file will be available only from\n   nic.ddn.mil\
    \ and hosts.txt will include ONLY MILNET HOSTS.  On April\n   1, 1993, a new root\
    \ DNS server will be placed in service.  It will be\n   available at ns.internic.net\
    \ ( 198.41.0.4 ).\n   The T1 service currently available to the DDN NIC will be\n\
    \   disconnected by June 1, 1993.  This will leave only 56K access to the\n  \
    \ DDN NIC site. Excessive traffic to this site after that date will\n   cause\
    \ congestion. Therefore, it is important that all Internet\n   registration data\
    \ be directed to the new InterNIC site.  The InterNIC\n   registration services\
    \ facility will be connected to SuraNET via T1\n   around March 10, 1993.\n  \
    \ Automated Internet registration services will be available from the\n   InterNIC\
    \ registration service host.  This new automated system will\n   allow more accurate\
    \ and timely processing of registration requests.\n   The basic functions/features\
    \ of the new automated registration\n   process (autoreg) are outlined below:\n\
    \   * Requestor sends a completed new template to\n     autoreg@internic.net.\n\
    \   * The mailserver/parser on the InterNIC registration host parses\n     the\
    \ template and makes a quick check of all verifiable\n     information (such as\
    \ Domain name conflicts).  The server\n     then sends an E-mail verification\
    \ or rejection with error message\n     back to the requestor.\n   * After receiving\
    \ the verification form for review, the requestor\n     should ensure that the\
    \ information was interpreted correctly by the\n     parser.  If the information\
    \ is correct, the requestor returns the\n     verify form to verify@internic.net.\
    \  If the information is not\n     correct, the requestor should make the necessary\
    \ corrections before\n     returning the form.  If a rejection was received the\
    \ requesstor\n     must make the necessary adjustments and resend the registration\n\
    \     request to autoreg@internic.net for processing.\n   * On receipt of a corrected\
    \ verification form from the original\n     requestor, the data will be rechecked\
    \ and a new verification form\n     will be sent.  Once a good verification has\
    \ been received by\n     Registration Services, the request will be released for\
    \ final\n     processing by the InterNIC registration staff.\n     NOTE: If the\
    \ requestor does not return the verification form to the\n     InterNIC within\
    \ seven days after it is mailed, the original\n     registration request will\
    \ expire, and it must be resubmitted.\n   Information on the status of all registration\
    \ requests will be\n   available to users via two methods.  The first method employs\
    \ the\n   \"finger\" utility.  The finger utility is executed specifying the\n\
    \   \"trouble ticket\" (tt) number returned with the registration request\n  \
    \ verification/ confirmation message.\n   Example:     finger tt-930303.1034@rs.internic.net\n\
    \   Users will also be able to obtain status information by connecting to\n  \
    \ rs.internic.net via telnet and executing the \"status <ticket number>\"\n  \
    \ command.  Status information will appear as follows.\n   [BEGIN SCRIPT]__________________________________________________________\n\

    \   Other services will also be available via telnet to rs.internic.net.\n   The\
    \ interface is similar to the telnet service currently offered by\n   the DDN-NIC.\
    \ However, the commands used on the InterNIC system are\n   slightly different.\
    \ The services that will be available via telnet\n   are:  WHOIS, Gopher, wais,\
    \ finger, and status.\n   Below is a short scripted session on the new InterNIC\
