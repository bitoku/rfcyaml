Abstract This document defines binary formats for IPv4 and IPv6 traffic selectors to be used in conjunction with flow bindings for Mobile IPv6.
This document defines binary formats for IPv4 and IPv6 traffic selector sub options, as defined in [RFC6089].
The binary traffic selector format defined here, allows for efficient identification of flow(s) based on well known fields in IPv4 [RFC0791], IPv6 [RFC2460], and transport layer headers like TCP [RFC0793] and UDP [RFC0768].
The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].
Traffic Selector Sub Options [RFC6089] defines the format for the traffic selector sub option.
The following values of the TS Format field are defined in this specification for binary traffic selectors.
TS Format: 1 IPv4 binary traffic selector 2 IPv6 binary traffic selector 3.1.
If the TS Format field of the traffic selector sub option indicates "IPv4 binary traffic selector", then the traffic selector is formatted as shown below.
The alignment requirement for this sub option is: 4n if A, B, C, D, E, or F
is set 2n if G, H, I, or J is set n if K, L, M, or N is set
A B C D E F G H I J K L M N
Figure 1: IPv4 binary traffic selector Flags
Each flag indicates whether the corresponding field is present in the message.
This field identifies the first source address, from the range of 32 bit IPv4 addresses to be matched, on data packets sent from a corresponding node to the mobile node as seen by the home agent.
In other words, this is one of the addresses of the correspondent node.
If more than one contiguous source address needs to be matched, then this field can be used to indicate the end value of a range starting from the value of the Start Source Address field.
This field MUST NOT be included unless the Start Source Address field is included.
When this field is included, the receiver will match all of the addresses between fields (A) and (B), inclusive of (A) and (B).
This field identifies the first destination address, from the range of 32 bit IPv4 addresses to be matched, on data packets sent from a corresponding node to the mobile node as seen by the home agent.
In other words, this is one of the registered home addresses of the mobile node.
If more than one contiguous destination address needs to be matched, then this field can be used to indicate the end value of a range starting from the value of the Start Destination Address field.
This field MUST NOT be included unless the Start Destination Address field is included.
When this field is included, the receiver will match all of the addresses between fields (C) and (D), inclusive of (C) and (D).
(E)Start IPsec SPI Security Parameter Index This field identifies the first 32 bit IPsec SPI value, from the range of SPI values to be matched, on data packets sent from a corresponding node to the mobile node as seen by the home agent.
This field is defined in [RFC4303].
(F)End IPsec SPI Security Parameter Index
If more than one contiguous SPI value needs to be matched, then this field can be used to indicate the end value of a range starting from the value of the Start IPsec SPI field.
This field MUST NOT be included unless the Start IPsec SPI field is included.
When this field is included, the receiver will match all of the SPI values between fields (E) and (F), inclusive of (E) and (F).
This field identifies the first 16 bit source port number, from the range of port numbers to be matched, on data packets sent from a corresponding node to the mobile node as seen by the home agent.
This is from the range of port numbers defined by IANA (http://www.iana.org).
If more than one contiguous source port number needs to be matched, then this field can be used to indicate the end value of a range starting from the value of the Start Source Port field.
This field MUST NOT be included unless the Start Source Port field is included.
When this field is included, the receiver will match all of the port numbers between fields (G) and (H), inclusive of (G) and (H).
This field identifies the first 16 bit destination port number, from the range of port numbers to be matched, on data packets sent from a corresponding node to the mobile node as seen by the home agent.
If more than one contiguous destination port number needs to be matched, then this field can be used to indicate the end value of a range starting from the value of the Start Destination Port field.
This field MUST NOT be included unless the Start Destination Port field is included.
When this field is included, the receiver will match all of the port numbers between fields (I) and (J), inclusive of (I) and (J).
This field identifies the first differential services value, from the range of differential services values to be matched, on data packets sent from a corresponding node to the mobile node as seen by the home agent.
Note that this field is called a "Type of Service field" in [RFC0791].
[RFC3260] then clarified that the field has been redefined as a 6 bit DS field with 2 bits reserved, later claimed by Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) [RFC3168].
For the purpose of this specification, the (K)Start DS field is 8 bits long, where the 6 most significant bits indicate the DS field to be matched and the 2 least significant bits' values MUST be ignored in any comparison.
If more than one contiguous DS value needs to be matched, then this field can be used to indicate the end value of a range starting from the value of the Start DS field.
This field MUST NOT be included unless the Start DS field is included.
When this field is included, it MUST be coded the same way as defined for (K).
When this field is included, the receiver will match all of the values between fields (K) and (L), inclusive of (K) and (L).
(M)Start Protocol This field identifies the first 8 bit protocol value, from the range of protocol values to be matched, on data packets sent from a corresponding node to the mobile node as seen by the home agent.
If more than one contiguous protocol value needs to be matched, then this field can be used to indicate the end value of a range starting from the value of the Start Protocol field.
This field MUST NOT be included unless the Start Protocol field is included.
When this field is included, the receiver will match all of the values between fields (M) and (N), inclusive of (M) and (N).
Reserved Reserved for future use.
These bits MUST be set to zero by the sender and ignored by the receiver.
If the TS Format field of the traffic selector sub option indicates "IPv6 binary traffic selector", then the traffic selector is formatted as follows:
The alignment requirement for this sub option is: 8n if A, B, C, or D
is set 4n if E, F, G, or H is set 2n if I, J, K, or L is set n if M, N, O, or P is set
A B C D E F G H I
J K L M N
IPv6 binary traffic selector Flags (A P)

For the purpose of this specification, the (M)Start TC field is 8 bits long, where the 6 most significant bits indicate the DS field to be matched and the 2 least significant bits' values MUST be ignored in any comparison.
If more than one contiguous TC value needs to be matched, then this field can be used to indicate the end value of a range starting from the value of the Start TC field.
