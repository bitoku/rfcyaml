- title: 3.  Common Definitions
  contents:
  - "3.  Common Definitions\n   Definitions in this section are well-known industry\
    \ and benchmarking\n   terms that may be defined elsewhere.\n   o    White Box\
    \ (Internal) Measurements\n        -    Definition\n             White box measurements\
    \ are those reported and collected on\n             the Device Under Test (DUT)\
    \ itself.\n        -    Discussion\n             These measurements rely on output\
    \ and event recording,\n             along with the clocking and time stamping\
    \ available on the\n             DUT itself.  Taking measurements on the DUT may\
    \ impact the\n             actual outcome of the test, since it can increase processor\n\
    \             loading, memory utilization, and timing factors.  Some\n       \
    \      devices may not have the required output readily available\n          \
    \   for taking internal measurements.\n             Note: White box measurements\
    \ can be influenced by the\n             vendor's implementation of various timers\
    \ and processing\n             models.  Whenever possible, internal measurements\
    \ should be\n             compared to external measurements to verify and validate\n\
    \             them.\n             Because of the potential for variations in collection\
    \ and\n             presentation methods across different DUTs, white box\n  \
    \           measurements MUST NOT be used as a basis for comparison in\n     \
    \        benchmarks.  This has been a guiding principle of the\n             Benchmarking\
    \ Methodology Working Group.\n   o    Black Box (External) Measurements\n    \
    \    -    Definition\n             Black box measurements infer the performance\
    \ of the DUT\n             through observation of its communications with other\n\
    \             devices.\n        -    Discussion\n             One example of a\
    \ black box measurement is when a downstream\n             device receives complete\
    \ routing information from the DUT,\n             it can be inferred that the\
    \ DUT has transmitted all the\n             routing information available.  External\
    \ measurements of\n             internal operations may suffer in that they include\
    \ not\n             just the protocol action times, but also propagation\n   \
    \          delays, queuing delays, and other such factors.\n             For the\
    \ purposes of [BENCHMARK], external techniques are\n             more readily\
    \ applicable.\n   o    Multi-device Measurements\n        -    Measurements assessing\
    \ communications (usually in\n             combination with internal operations)\
    \ between two or more\n             DUTs.  Multi-device measurements may be internal\
    \ or\n             external.\n"

  - "4.  Terms Defined Elsewhere\n   Terms in this section are defined elsewhere and\
    \ are included only as\n   they apply to [BENCHMARK].\n   o    Point-to-Point\
    \ Links\n        -    Definition\n             See [OSPF], Section 1.2.\n    \
    \    -    Discussion\n             A point-to-point link can take less time to\
    \ converge than a\n             broadcast link of the same speed because it does\
    \ not have\n             the overhead of DR election.  Point-to-point links can\
    \ be\n             either numbered or unnumbered.  However, in the context of\n\
    \             [BENCHMARK] and [OSPF], the two can be regarded as the\n       \
    \      same.\n   o    Broadcast Link\n        -    Definition\n             See\
    \ [OSPF], Section 1.2.\n        -    Discussion\n             The adjacency formation\
    \ time on a broadcast link can be\n             greater than that on a point-to-point\
    \ link of the same\n             speed because DR election has to take place.\
    \  All routers\n             on a broadcast network form adjacency with the DR\
    \ and BDR.\n             Asynchronous flooding also takes place through the DR.\
    \  In\n             the context of convergence, it may take more time for an\n\
    \             LSA to be flooded from one DR-other router to another\n        \
    \     because the LSA first has to be processed at the DR.\n   o    Shortest Path\
    \ First Execution Time\n        -    Definition\n             The time taken by\
    \ a router to complete the SPF process, as\n             described in [OSPF].\n\
    \        -    Discussion\n             This does not include the time taken by\
    \ the router to\n             install routes in the forwarding engine.\n     \
    \        Some implementations may force two intervals, the SPF hold\n        \
    \     time and the SPF delay, between successive SPF\n             calculations.\
    \  If an SPF hold time exists, it should be\n             subtracted from the\
    \ total SPF execution time.  If an SPF\n             delay exists, it should be\
    \ noted in the test results.\n        -    Measurement Units\n             The\
    \ SPF time is generally measured in milliseconds.\n   o Hello Interval\n     \
    \   -    Definition\n             See [OSPF], Section 7.1.\n        -    Discussion\n\
    \             The hello interval must be the same for all routers on a\n     \
    \        network.\n             Decreasing the hello interval can allow the router\
    \ dead\n             interval (below) to be reduced, thus reducing convergence\n\
    \             times in those situations where the router dead interval's\n   \
    \          timing out causes an OSPF process to notice an adjacency\n        \
    \     failure.  Further discussion of small hello intervals is\n             given\
    \ in [OSPF-SCALING].\n   o    Router Dead Interval\n        -    Definition\n\
    \             See [OSPF], Section 7.1.\n        -    Discussion\n            \
    \ This is advertised in the router's Hello Packets in the\n             Router-DeadInterval\
    \ field.  The router dead interval should\n             be some multiple of the\
    \ HelloInterval (perhaps 4 times the\n             hello interval) and must be\
    \ the same for all routers\n             attached to a common network.\n"

- title: 5.1.  The Meaning of Single Router Control Plane Convergence
  contents:
  - "5.1.  The Meaning of Single Router Control Plane Convergence\n   A network is\
    \ termed as converged when all the devices within the\n   network have a loop-free\
    \ path to each possible destination.  However,\n   because we are not testing\
    \ network convergence but testing\n   performance for a particular device within\
    \ a network, this definition\n   needs to be streamlined to fit within a single\
    \ device view.\n   In this case, convergence will mean the point in time when\
    \ the DUT\n   has performed all actions needed in order to react to the change\
    \ in\n   the topology represented by the test condition.  For instance, an\n \
    \  OSPF device must flood any new information it has received, rebuild\n   its\
    \ shortest path first (SPF) tree, and install any new paths or\n   destinations\
    \ in the local routing information base (RIB, or routing\n   table).\n   Note\
    \ that the word \"convergence\" has two distinct meanings: the\n   process of\
    \ a group of individuals meeting at the same place, and the\n   process of an\
    \ individual coming to the same place as an existing\n   group.  This work focuses\
    \ on the second meaning of the word, so we\n   consider the time required for\
    \ a single device to adapt to a network\n   change to be Single Router Convergence.\n\
    \   This concept does not include the time required for the control plane\n  \
    \ of the device to transfer the information required to forward packets\n   to\
    \ the data plane.  It also does not include the amount of time\n   between when\
    \ the data plane receives that information and when it is\n   able to forward\
    \ traffic.\n"
- title: 5.2.  Measuring Convergence
  contents:
  - "5.2.  Measuring Convergence\n   Obviously, there are several elements to convergence,\
    \ even under the\n   definition given above for a single device, including (but\
    \ not\n   limited to) the following:\n   o    The time it takes for the DUT to\
    \ pass the information about a\n        network event on to its neighbors.\n \
    \  o    The time it takes for the DUT to process information about a\n       \
    \ network event and to calculate a new Shortest Path Tree (SPT).\n   o    The\
    \ time it takes for the DUT to make changes in its local RIB\n        reflecting\
    \ the new shortest path tree.\n"
