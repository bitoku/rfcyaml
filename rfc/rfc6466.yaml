- title: 1.  Overview
  contents:
  - "1.  Overview\n   In an earlier version of the SDP specification [RFC2327] of\n\
    \   packetized media types, such as those used with the Real-time\n   Transport\
    \ Protocol (RTP) [RFC3550], share the namespace with\n   Multipurpose Internet\
    \ Mail Extensions (MIME) media types registry\n   [RFC4288] [RFC4289] (i.e., \"\
    MIME media types\").  This is in contrast\n   to the latest version of the SDP\
    \ specification [RFC4566], which\n   requested that an SDP-specific media type\
    \ registry be created and\n   maintained by IANA.  The top-level SDP media content\
    \ types registered\n   by RFC 4566 [RFC4566] are 'audio', 'video', 'text', 'application',\n\
    \   and 'message'.  A glaring omission from this list is the 'image'\n   media\
    \ type.\n   The 'image' media type is an existing top-level MIME media type and\n\
    \   is widely used in SDP implementations for setting up T.38 Real-Time\n   Facsimile\
    \ [T38] media streams.  This media type is extensively\n   referenced by examples\
    \ in ITU-T T.38 [T38] and IETF Standards Track\n   documents like RFC 4145 [RFC4145].\
    \  The following example shows the\n   media description of a T.38 media stream\
    \ as commonly found in a\n   Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) [RFC3261] INVITE;\
    \ it contains an\n   SDP offer for T.38 over both UDP Transport Layer (UDPTL)\
    \ and TCP.\n   For the sake of brevity, only the SDP body of the SIP INVITE request\n\
    \   is displayed in this example.\n       v=0\n       o=alice 53655765 2353687637\
    \ IN IP4 pc33.example.com\n       s=SDP image example\n       c=IN IP4 192.0.2.2\n\
    \       t=0 0\n       m=image 49170 udptl t38\n       a=T38FaxVersion:0\n    \
    \   a=T38MaxBitRate:14400\n       a=T38FaxRateManagement:transferredTCF\n    \

    \   The purpose of this document is to register with IANA the 'image'\n   media\
    \ type as a top-level SDP media type.  This ensures seamless\n   continuity with\
    \ documentation that uses the 'image' MIME media type\n   and the previously registered\
    \ MIME media sub-types like 'image/t38'\n   [RFC3362] that are used as SDP media\
    \ descriptors for T.38 [T38].\n   This document complies with the request of Section\
    \ 8.2.1 of RFC 4566\n   [RFC4566] that indicates:\n      The same rules should\
    \ apply for media names as for top-level media\n      content types, and where\
    \ possible the same name should be\n      registered for SDP as for MIME.  For\
    \ media other than existing\n      top-level media content types, a Standards\
    \ Track RFC MUST be\n      produced for a new top-level content type to be registered,\
    \ and\n      the registration MUST provide good justification why no existing\n\
    \      media name is appropriate.\n"

- title: 3.  IANA Considerations
  contents:
  - "3.  IANA Considerations\n   IANA has registered an 'image' token in the media\
    \ sub-registry of the\n   Session Description Protocols (SDP) Parameters registry.\
    \  This\n   registration contains the required information elements outlined in\n\
    \   the SDP registration procedure defined in Section 8.2.8 of RFC 4566\n   [RFC4566].\n\

    \ Email: gsalguei@cisco.com\n           Telephone Number: (919) 392-3266\n   (2)\
    \  Name being registered (as it will appear in SDP): image\n   (3)  Long-form\
    \ name in English: image\n   (4)  Type of name ('media', 'proto', 'fmt', 'bwtype',\
    \ 'nettype', or\n        'addrtype'): media\n   (5)  Purpose of the registered\
    \ name:\n           The 'image' media type for the Session Description Protocol\n\
    \           is used to describe a media stream whose content consists of\n   \
    \        one or more separate images that require appropriate hardware\n     \
    \      to display.  The media subtype further describes the specific\n       \
    \    format of the image.  Currently, the 'image' media type for\n           SDP\
    \ is used ubiquitously by the SIP control protocol to\n           establish T.38\
    \ media streams.\n   (6)  Specification for the registered name: RFC 6466\n"
- title: 4.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "4.  Security Considerations\n   The 'image' media type registered by this document\
    \ in the SDP\n   parameters registry maintained by IANA is primarily for use by\
    \ the\n   offer/answer model of the Session Description Protocol [RFC3264] for\n\
    \   the negotiation and establishment of T.38 [T38] media streams using\n   SIP\
    \ [RFC3261].  This additional SDP media type does not introduce any\n   security\
    \ considerations beyond those detailed in Section 7 of RFC\n   4566 [RFC4566].\n\
    \   The security vulnerabilities in T.38 [T38] and its associated\n   transport\
    \ protocols (TCP [RFC0793], UDP [RFC0768], and RTP [RFC3550])\n   are well documented\
    \ in each of their respective specifications.  The\n   ability to exchange images\
    \ other than T.38 can expose the recipient\n   to potentially malicious executable\
    \ code.\n"
