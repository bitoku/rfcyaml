  - "1.  Introduction\n   The LDP Capabilities specification [RFC5561] introduced
    a mechanism\n   to negotiate LDP capabilities for a given feature between peer
    Label\n   Switching Routers (LSRs).  The capability mechanism ensures that no\n
    \  unnecessary state is exchanged between peer LSRs unless the\n   corresponding
    feature capability is successfully negotiated between\n   the peers.\n   Newly
    defined LDP features and applications, such as Typed Wildcard\n   Forwarding Equivalence
    Class (FEC) [RFC5918], Inter-Chassis\n   Communication Protocol [RFC7275], mLDP
    [RFC6388], and L2VPN Point-to-\n   multipoint (P2MP) PW [RFC7338] make use of
    LDP capabilities framework\n   for their feature negotiation.  However, the earlier
    LDP applications\n   allowed LDP speakers to exchange application state without
    any\n   capability negotiation.  This, in turn, results in the unnecessary\n   advertisement
    of state when a given application is not enabled on one\n   of the LDP speakers.
    \ These earlier LDP applications include (i)\n   application to establish LSPs
    for IP unicast prefixes and (ii)\n   application to signal when L2VPN P2P PW [RFC4447]
    [RFC4762].  For\n   example, when bringing up and using an LDP peer session with
    a remote\n   Provider Edge (PE) LSR for purely ICCP-signaling reasons, an LDP\n
    \  speaker may unnecessarily advertise labels for IP (unicast) prefixes\n   to
    this ICCP-related LDP peer.\n   Another example of unnecessary state advertisement
    can be cited when\n   LDP is to be deployed in an IP dual-stack environment.  For
    instance,\n   an LSR that is locally enabled to set up LSPs for both IPv4 and
    IPv6\n   prefixes may advertise (address and label) bindings for both IPv4 and\n
    \  IPv6 address families towards an LDP peer that is interested in IPv4\n   bindings
    only.  In this case, the advertisement of IPv6 bindings to\n   the peer is unnecessary,
    as well as wasteful, from the point of view\n   of LSR memory/CPU and network
    resource consumption.\n   To avoid this unnecessary state advertisement and exchange,
    currently\n   an operator is typically required to configure and define filtering\n
    \  policies on the LSR, which introduces unnecessary operational\n   overhead
    and complexity for such deployments.\n   This document defines a solution based
    on LDP Capabilities [RFC5561]\n   by which an LDP speaker may announce to its
    peer(s) its disinterest\n   (or non-support) for state to set up IP Prefix LSPs
    and/or to signal\n   L2VPN P2P PW at the time of session establishment.  This
    capability\n   helps in avoiding unnecessary state advertisement for such feature\n
    \  applications.  This document also states the mechanics to dynamically\n   disable
    or enable the state advertisement for such applications\n   during the session
    lifetime.  The \"uninteresting\" state of an\n   application depends on the type
    of application and is described later\n   in Section 3.1.\n"

  - "3.  Non-negotiated LDP Applications\n   For the applications that existed prior
    to the definition of the LDP\n   Capabilities framework [RFC5561], an LDP speaker
    typically\n   advertises, without waiting for any capabilities exchange and\n
    \  negotiation, its corresponding application state to its peers after\n   the
    session establishment.  These early LDP applications include:\n      o IPv4/IPv6
    Prefix LSPs Setup\n      o L2VPN P2P FEC 128 and FEC 129 PWs Signaling\n   The
    rest of This document uses the following shorthand terms for\n   these earlier
    LDP applications:\n   o  \"Prefix-LSPs\": Refers to an application that sets up
    LDP LSPs\n      corresponding to IP routes/prefixes by advertising label bindings\n
    \     for Prefix FEC (as defined in RFC 5036).\n   o  \"P2P-PWs\": Refers to an
    application that signals FEC 128 and/or\n      FEC 129 L2VPN P2P PWs using LDP
    (as defined in RFC 4447).\n   To disable unnecessary state exchange for such LDP
    applications over\n   an established LDP session, a new capability is being introduced
    in\n   this document.  This new capability controls the advertisement of\n   application
    state and enables an LDP speaker to notify its peer its\n   disinterest in the
    state of one or more of these \"Non-negotiated\" LDP\n   applications at the time
    of session establishment.  Upon receipt of\n   such a capability, the receiving
    LDP speaker, if supporting the\n   capability, disables the advertisement of the
    state related to the\n   application towards the sender of the capability.  This
    new\n   capability can also be sent later in a Capability message either to\n
    \  disable a previously enabled application's state advertisement or to\n   enable
    a previously disabled application's state advertisement.\n"

    - "3.1.  Uninteresting State\n   A uninteresting state of a non-negotiated LDP
      application:\n   -  is the application state that is of no interest to an LSR
      and need\n      not be advertised to the LSR;\n   -  need not be advertised
      in any of the LDP protocol messages;\n   -  is dependent on application type
      and specified accordingly.\n"
    - contents:
      - "3.1.1.  Prefix-LSPs\n   For the Prefix-LSP application type, the uninteresting
        state refers\n   to any state related to IP Prefix FEC (such as FEC label
        bindings,\n   LDP Status).  This document, however, does not classify IP address\n
        \  bindings (advertised via ADDRESS message) as a uninteresting state\n   and
        allows the advertisement of IP address bindings.  The reason for\n   this
        allowance is that an LSR typically uses peer IP address(es) to\n   map an
        IP routing next hop to an LDP peer in order to implement its\n   control plane
        procedures.  For example, mLDP [RFC6388] uses a peer's\n   IP address(es)
        to determine its upstream LSR to reach the Root node\n   as well as to select
        the forwarding interface towards its downstream\n   LSR.  Hence, in an mLDP-only
        network, while it is desirable to\n   disable advertisement of label bindings
        for IP (unicast) prefixes,\n   disabling advertisement of IP address bindings
        will break mLDP\n   functionality.  Similarly, other LDP applications may
        also depend on\n   learnt peer IP addresses; hence, this document does not
        put IP\n   address binding into a uninteresting state category to facilitate\n
        \  such LDP applications.\n"

      \  For example, if there are two SAC elements present, then the \"Length\"\n
      \  field is set to 3 octets.  A receiver of this capability TLV can\n   deduce
      the number of elements present in the TLV by using the\n   \"Length\" field.\n
      \  This document uses the term \"element\" to refer to a SAC Element.\n   As
      described earlier, the SAC Capability TLV MAY be included by an\n   LDP speaker
      in an Initialization message to signal to its peer LSR\n   that state exchange
      for one or more applications needs to be disabled\n   on the given peer session.
      \ This TLV can also be sent later in a\n   Capability message to selectively
      enable or disable these\n   applications.  If there is more than one element
      present in a SAC\n   Capability TLV, the elements MUST belong to distinct app
      types and\n   the app type MUST NOT appear more than once.  If a receiver receives\n
      \  such a malformed TLV, it SHOULD discard this TLV and continue\n   processing
      the rest of the message.  If an LSR receives a message\n   with a SAC capability
      TLV containing an element with the \"App\" field\n   set to a value other than
      defined above, the receiver MUST ignore and\n   discard the element and continue
      processing the rest of the TLV.\n   To control more than one application state,
      a sender LSR can either\n   send a single capability TLV in a message with multiple
      elements\n   present or send separate messages with a capability TLV specifying\n
      \  one or more elements.  A receiving LSR, however, MUST treat each\n   incoming
      capability TLV with an element corresponding to a given\n   application type
      as an update to its existing policy for the given\n   type.\n   To understand
      capability updates from an example, let us consider two\n   LSRs, S (LDP speaker)
      and P (LDP peer), both of which support all the\n   non-negotiated applications
      listed earlier.  By default, these LSRs\n   will advertise state for these applications,
      as configured, to their\n   peer as soon as an LDP session is established.  Now
      assume that P\n   receives from S a SAC capability in an Initialization message
      with\n   \"IPv6 Prefix-LSPs\" and \"FEC 129 P2P-PW\" applications disabled.
      \ This\n   updates P's outbound policy towards S to advertise state related
      to\n   only IPv4 Prefix-LSPs and FEC 128 P2P-PW applications.  Later, P\n   receives
      another capability update from S via a Capability message\n   with \"IPv6 Prefix-LSPs\"
      enabled and \"FEC 128 P2P-PWs\" disabled.  This\n   results in P's outbound
      policy towards S to advertise both IPv4 and\n   IPv6 Prefix-LSPs application
      state and disable both FEC 128 and FEC\n   129 P2P-PWs signaling.  Finally,
      P receives another update from S via\n   a Capability message that specifies
      to disable all four non-\n   negotiated applications states, resulting in P
      outbound policy\n   towards S to block/disable state for all these applications
      and only\n   advertise state for any other application, as applicable.\n"

    - "4.2.  Capabilities Procedures\n   The SAC capability conveys the desire of
      an LSR to disable the\n   receipt of unwanted/unnecessary state from its LDP
      peer.  This\n   capability is unilateral and unidirectional in nature, and a\n
      \  receiving LSR is not required to send a similar capability TLV in an\n   Initialization
      or Capability message towards the sender of this\n   capability.  This unilateral
      behavior conforms to the procedures\n   defined in the Section 6 of LDP Capabilities
      [RFC5561].\n   After this capability is successfully negotiated (i.e., sent
      by an\n   LSR and received/understood by its peer), then the receiving LSR MUST\n
      \  NOT advertise any state related to the disabled applications towards\n   the
      capability-sending LSR until and unless these application states\n   are explicitly
      enabled again via a capability update.  Upon receipt\n   of a capability update
      to disable an enabled application state during\n   the lifetime of a session,
      the receiving LSR MUST also withdraw from\n   the peer any previously advertised
      state corresponding to the\n   disabled application.\n   If a receiving LDP
      speaker does not understand the SAC capability\n   TLV, then it MUST respond
      to the sender with an \"Unsupported TLV\"\n   notification as described in \"LDP
      Capabilities\" [RFC5561].  If a\n   receiving LDP speaker does not understand
      or does not support an\n   application specified in an application control element,
      it SHOULD\n   silently ignore/skip such an element and continue processing rest
      of\n   the TLV.\n"
    - contents:
      - "4.2.1.  State Control Capability in an Initialization Message\n   The LDP
        Capabilities framework [RFC5561] dictates that the S-bit of\n   the capability
        parameter in an Initialization message MUST be set to\n   1 and SHOULD be
        ignored on receipt.\n   An LDP speaker determines (e.g., via some local configuration
        or\n   default policy) if it needs to disable Prefix-LSPs and/or P2P-PW\n
        \  applications with a peer LSR.  If there is a need to disable, then\n   the
        SAC TLV needs to be included in the Initialization message with\n   respective
        SAC elements included with their D-bit set to 1.\n   An LDP speaker that supports
        the SAC capability MUST interpret the\n   capability TLV in a received Initialization
        message such that it\n   disables the advertisement of the application state
        towards the\n   capability sending LSR for Prefix-LSPs and/or P2P-PW applications
        if\n   their SAC element's D-bit is set to 1.\n"

        supports \"Dynamic Announcement Capability\" [RFC5561],\n   then an LDP speaker
        may send a SAC capability in a Capability message\n   towards the peer.  Once
        advertised, these capabilities cannot be\n   withdrawn; hence, the S-bit of
        the TLV MUST be set to 1 when sent in\n   a Capability message.\n   An LDP
        speaker may decide to send this TLV towards an LDP peer if one\n   or more
        of its Prefix-LSPs and/or P2P-PW applications get disabled,\n   or if a previously
        disabled application gets enabled again.  In this\n   case, the LDP speaker
        constructs the TLV with appropriate SAC\n   elements and sends the corresponding
        capability TLV in a Capability\n   message.\n   Upon receipt of this TLV in
        a Capability message, the receiving LDP\n   speaker reacts in the same manner
        as it reacts upon the receipt of\n   this TLV in an Initialization message.

    an LSR towards a neighbor\n   only if it is known that such bindings advertisement
    and exchange\n   with the neighbor is unnecessary and wasteful.\n   The following
    table summarizes a non-exhaustive list of typical LDP\n   session types on which
    this new SAC capability and its procedures are\n   expected to be applied to disable
    advertisement of uninteresting\n   state:\n   +===============================+=================================+\n

    \  It is to be noted that if an application state needs changing after\n   session
    initialization (e.g., to enable a previously disabled\n   application or to disable
    a previously enabled application), the\n   procedures defined in this document
    expect LSR peers to support the\n   LDP \"Dynamic Announcement\" Capability to
    announce the change in SAC\n   capability via an LDP Capability message.  However,
    if any of the\n   peering LSRs do not support this capability, the alternate option
    is\n   to force reset the LDP session to advertise the new SAC capability\n   accordingly
    during the following session initialization.\n   The following are some additional
    important points that an operator\n   needs to consider regarding the applicability
    of this new capability\n   and associated procedures defined in this document:\n
    \  -  An operator SHOULD disable Prefix-LSP state on any Targeted LDP\n      (tLDP)
    session that is established for ICCP-only and/or PW-only\n      purposes.\n   -
    \ An operator MUST NOT disable Prefix-LSP state on any tLDP session\n      that
    is established for reasons related to remote Loop-Free\n      Alternate (LFA)
    Fast Re-Route (FRR) [RLFA].\n   -  In a remote network that is LFA FRR [RLFA]
    enabled, it is\n      RECOMMENDED not to disable Prefix-LSP state on a tLDP session
    even\n      if the current session type is PW-only and/or ICCP-only.  This is\n
    \     recommended because any remote/tLDP neighbor could potentially be\n      picked
    as a remote LFA PQ node.\n   -  This capability SHOULD be enabled for Prefix-LSPs
    in the scenarios\n      when it is desirable to disable (or enable) advertisement
    of \"all\"\n      the prefix label bindings.  For scenarios in which a \"subset\"
    of\n      bindings need to be filtered, the existing filtering procedures\n      pertaining
    to label binding announcement should be used.\n   -  Using label advertisement
    filtering policies in conjunction with\n      the procedures defined in this document
    for Prefix-LSPs is\n      allowed.  In such cases, the label bindings will be
    announced as\n      per the label filtering policy for the given neighbor when
    Prefix-\n      LSP application is enabled.\n"
