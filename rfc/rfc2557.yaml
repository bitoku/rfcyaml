  - "Abstract\n   HTML [RFC 1866] defines a powerful means of specifying multimedia\n
    \  documents. These multimedia documents consist of a text/html root\n   resource
    (object) and other subsidiary resources (image, video clip,\n   applet, etc. objects)
    referenced by Uniform Resource Identifiers\n   (URIs) within the text/html root
    resource. When an HTML multimedia\n   document is retrieved by a browser, each
    of these component resources\n   is individually retrieved in real time from a
    location, and using a\n   protocol, specified by each URI.\n   In order to transfer
    a complete HTML multimedia document in a single\n   e-mail message, it is necessary
    to: a) aggregate a text/html root\n   resource and all of the subsidiary resources
    it references into a\n   single composite message structure, and b) define a means
    by which\n   URIs in the text/html root can reference subsidiary resources within\n
    \  that composite message structure.\n   This document a) defines the use of a
    MIME multipart/related\n   structure to aggregate a text/html root resource and
    the subsidiary\n   resources it references, and b) specifies a MIME content-header\n
    \  (Content-Location) that allow URIs in a multipart/related text/html\n   root
    body part to reference subsidiary resources in other body parts\n   of the same
    multipart/related structure.\n   While initially designed to support e-mail transfer
    of complete\n   multi-resource HTML multimedia documents, these conventions can
    also\n   be employed to resources retrieved by other transfer protocols such\n
    \  as HTTP and FTP to retrieve a complete multi-resource HTML multimedia\n   document
    in a single transfer or for storage and archiving of\n   complete HTML-documents.\n
    \  Differences between this and a previous version of this standard,\n   which
    was published as RFC 2110, are summarized in chapter 12.\n"

  - "1.  Introduction\n   There are a number of document formats (Hypertext Markup
    Language\n   [HTML2], Extended Markup Language [XML], Portable Document format\n
    \  [PDF] and Virtual Reality Markup Language [VRML]) that specify\n   documents
    consisting of a root resource and a number of distinct\n   subsidiary resources
    referenced by URIs within that root resource.\n   There is an obvious need to
    be able to send such multi-resource\n   documents in e-mail [SMTP], [RFC822] messages.\n
    \  The standard defined in this document specifies how to aggregate such\n   multi-resource
    documents in MIME-formatted [MIME1 to MIME5] messages\n   for precisely this purpose.\n
    \  While this specification was developed to satisfy the specific\n   aggregation
    requirements of multi-resource HTML documents, it may\n   also be applicable to
    other multi-resource document representations\n   linked by URIs. While this is
    the case, there is no requirement that\n   implementations claiming conformance
    to this standard be able to\n   handle any URI linked document representations
    other than those whose\n   root is HTML.\n   This aggregation into a single message
    of a root resource and the\n   subsidiary resources it references may also be
    applicable to\n   resources retrieved by other protocols such as HTTP or FTP,
    or to the\n   archiving of complete web pages as they appeared at a particular\n
    \  point in time.\n   An informational RFC will be published as a supplement to
    this\n   standard. The informational RFC will discuss implementation methods\n
    \  and some implementation problems. Implementers are strongly\n   recommended
    to read this informational RFC when developing\n   implementations of this standard.
    You can find it through URL\n   http://www.dsv.su.se/~jpalme/ietf/mhtml.html.\n
    \  This standard specifies that body parts to be referenced can be\n   identified
    either by a Content-ID (containing a Message-ID value) or\n   by a Content-Location
    (containing an arbitrary URL). The reason why\n   this standard does not only
    recommend the use of Content-ID-s is that\n   it should be possible to forward
    existing web pages via e-mail\n   without having to rewrite the source text of
    the web pages. Such\n   rewriting has several disadvantages, one of them that
    security\n   checksums will probably be invalidated.\n"

  - "3.  Overview\n   An aggregate document is a MIME-encoded message that contains
    a root\n   resource (object) as well as other resources linked to it via URIs.\n
    \  These other resources may be required to display a multimedia\n   document
    based on the root resource (inline pictures, style sheets,\n   applets, etc.),
    or be the root resources of other multimedia\n   documents. It is important to
    keep in mind that aggregate documents\n   need to satisfy the differing needs
    of several audiences.\n   Mail sending agents might send aggregate documents as
    an encoding of\n   normal day-to-day electronic mail. Mail sending agents might
    also\n   send aggregate documents when a user wishes to mail a particular\n   document
    from the web to someone else. Finally mail sending agents\n   might send aggregate
    documents as automatic responders, providing\n   access to WWW resources for non-IP
    connected clients. Also with other\n   protocols such as HTTP or FTP, there may
    sometimes be a need to\n   retrieve aggregate documents. Receiving agents also
    have several\n   differing needs. Some receiving agents might be able to receive
    an\n   aggregate document and display it just as any other text content type\n
    \  would be displayed.  Others might have to pass this aggregate\n   document
    to a browsing program, and provisions need to be made to\n   make this possible.\n
    \  Finally several other constraints on the problem arise. It is\n   important
    that it be possible for a document to be signed and for it\n   to be transmitted
    and displayed without breaking the message\n   integrity (MIC) checksum that is
    part of the signature.\n"

    title: 4.1 MIME content headers
  - contents:
    - "4.2 The Content-Location Header\n   A Content-Location header specifies an
      URI that labels the content of\n   a body part in whose heading it is placed.
      Its value CAN be an\n   absolute or a relative URI. Any URI or URL scheme may
      be used, but\n   use of non-standardized URI or URL schemes might entail some
      risk\n   that recipients cannot handle them correctly.\n   An URI in a Content-Location
      header need not refer to an resource\n   which is globally available for retrieval
      using this URI (after\n   resolution of relative URIs). However, URI-s in Content-Location\n
      \  headers (if absolute, or resolvable to absolute URIs) SHOULD still be\n   globally
      unique.\n   A Content-Location header can thus be used to label a resource which\n
      \  is not retrievable by some or all recipients of a message. For\n   example
      a Content-Location header may label an object which is only\n   retrievable
      using this URI in a restricted domain, such as within a\n   company-internal
      web space. A Content-Location header can even\n   contain a fictitious URI.
      Such an URI need not be globally unique.\n   A single Content-Location header
      field is allowed in any message or\n   content heading, in addition to a Content-ID
      header (as specified in\n   [MIME1]) and, in Message headings, a Message-ID
      (as specified in\n   [RFC822]). All of these constitute different, equally valid
      body part\n   labels, and any of them may be used to satisfy a reference to
      a body\n   part. Multiple Content-Location header fields in the same message\n
      \  heading are not allowed.\n   Example of a multipart/related structure containing
      body parts with\n   both Content-Location and Content-ID labels:\n      Content-Type:
      multipart/related; boundary=\"boundary-example\";\n                    type=\"text/html\"\n
      \     --boundary-example\n      Content-Type: text/html; charset=\"US-ASCII\"\n

    - "4.3 URIs of MHTML aggregates\n   The URI of an MHTML aggregate is not the same

      retrieve\n   in-line linked resources. If a Content-Location header field is
      used\n   in the heading of a multipart/related, this Content-Location SHOULD\n
      \  apply to the whole aggregate, not to its root part.\n   When an URI referring
      to an MHTML aggregate is used to retrieve this\n   aggregate, the set of resources
      retrieved can be different from the\n   set of resources retrieved using the
      Content-Locations of its parts.\n   For example, retrieving an MHTML aggregate

        to [URL] or the URI syntax standard\n   has been changed to allow characters
        not previously allowed in MIME\n   headers. These URIs cannot be sent directly
        in a message header. If\n   such a URI occurs, all spaces and other illegal
        characters in it must\n   be encoded using one of the methods described in
        [MIME3] section 4.\n   This encoding MUST only be done in the header, not
        in the HTML text.\n   Receiving clients MUST decode the [MIME3] encoding in
        the heading\n   before comparing URIs in body text to URIs in Content-Location\n
        \  headers.\n   The charset parameter value \"US-ASCII\" SHOULD be used if
        the URI\n   contains no octets outside of the 7-bit range. If such octets
        are\n   present, the correct charset parameter value (derived e.g. from\n
        \  information about the HTML document the URI was found in) SHOULD be\n   used.
        If this cannot be safely established, the value \"UNKNOWN-8BIT\"\n   [RFC
        1428] MUST be used.\n   Note, that for the matching of URIs in text/html body
        parts to URIs\n   in Content-Location headers, the value of the charset parameter
        is\n   irrelevant, but that it may be relevant for other purposes, and that\n
        \  incorrect labeling MUST, therefore, be avoided. Warning: Irrelevance\n
        \  of the charset parameter may not be true in the future, if different\n

  - "6.  Sending documents without linked objects\n   If a text/html resource (object)
    is sent without subsidiary\n   resources, to which it refers, it MAY be sent by
    itself. In this\n   case, embedding it in a multipart/related structure is not
    necessary.\n   Such a text/html resource may either contain no URIs, or URIs which\n
    \  the recipient is expected to retrieve (if possible) via a URI\n   specified
    protocol. A text/html resource may also be sent with\n   unresolvable links in
    special cases, such as when two authors\n   exchange drafts of unfinished resources.\n
    \  Inclusion of URIs referencing resources which the recipient has to\n   retrieve
    via an URI specified protocol may not work for some\n   recipients. This is because
    not all e-mail recipients have full\n   Internet connectivity, or because URIs
    which work for a sender will\n   not work for a recipient. This occurs, for example,
    when an URI\n   refers to a resource within a company-internal network that is
    not\n   accessible from outside the company.\n"

  - "7.  Use of the Content-Type \"multipart/related\"\n   If a message contains one
    or more MIME body parts containing URIs and\n   also contains as separate body
    parts, resources, to which these URIs\n   (as defined, for example, in HTML 2.0
    [HTML2]) refer, then this whole\n   set of body parts (referring body parts and
    referred-to body parts)\n   SHOULD be sent within a multipart/related structure
    as defined in\n   [REL].\n   Even though headers can occur in a message that lacks
    an associated\n   multipart/related structure, this standard only covers their
    use for\n   resolution of URIs between body parts inside a multipart/related\n
    \  structure. This standard does cover the case where a resource in a\n   nested
    multipart/related structure contains URIs that reference MIME\n   body parts in
    another  multipart/related structure, in which it is\n   enclosed. This standard
    does not cover the case where a resource in a\n   multipart/related structure
    contains URIs that reference MIME body\n   parts in another parallel or nested
    multipart/related structure, or\n   in another MIME message, even if methods similar
    to those described\n   in this standard are used. Implementers who employ such
    URIs are\n   warned that receiving agents implementing this standard may not be\n
    \  able to process such references.\n   When the start body part of a multipart/related
    structure is an\n   atomic object, such as a text/html resource, it SHOULD be
    employed as\n   the root resource of that multipart/related structure. When the
    start\n   body part of a multipart/related structure is a multipart/alternative\n
    \  structure, and that structure contains at least one alternative body\n   part
    which is a suitable atomic object, such as a text/html resource,\n   then that
    body part SHOULD be employed as the root resource of the\n   aggregate document.
    \ Implementers are warned, however, that some\n   receiving agents treat multipart/alternative
    as if it had been\n   multipart/mixed (even though MIME [MIME1] requires support
    for\n   multipart/alternative).\n   [REL] specifies that a type parameter is mandatory
    in a \"Content-\n   Type:  multipart/related\" header, and requires that it be
    employed to\n   specify the type of the multipart/related start object. Thus,
    the\n   type parameter value shall be \"multipart/alternative\", when the start\n
    \  part is of \"Content-type multipart/alternative\", even if the actual\n   root
    resource is of type \"text/html\". In addition, if the\n   multipart/related start
    object is not the first body part in a\n   multipart/related structure, [REL]
    further requires that its\n   Content-ID MUST be specified as the value of a start
    parameter in the\n   \"Content-Type:  multipart/related\" header.\n   When rendering
    a resource in a multipart/related structure, URI\n   references within that resource
    can be satisfied by body parts within\n   the same multipart/related structure
    (see section 8.2 below). This is\n   useful:\n   (a) For those recipients who
    only have email but not full Internet\n       access.\n   (b) For those recipients
    who for other reasons, such as firewalls or\n       the use of company-internal
    links, cannot retrieve URI referenced\n       resources via URI specified protocols.\n
    \      Note, that this means that you can, via e-mail, send text/html\n       objects
    which includes URIs which the recipient cannot resolve\n       via HTTP or other
    connectivity-requiring URIs.\n   (c) To send a document whose content is preserved
    even if the\n       resources to which embedded URIs refer are later changed or\n
    \      deleted.\n   (d) For resources which are not available for protocol based\n
    \      retrieval.\n   (e) To speed up access.\n   When a sending MUA sends objects
    which were retrieved from the WWW,\n   it SHOULD maintain their WWW URIs. It SHOULD
    not transform these URIs\n   into some other URI form prior to transmitting them.
    This will allow\n   the receiving MUA to both verify MICs included with the message,
    as\n   well as verify the documents against their WWW counterpoints, if this\n
    \  is appropriate.\n   In certain cases this will not work - for example, if a
    resource\n   contains URIs as parameters to objects and applets. In such a case,\n
    \  it might be better to rewrite the document before sending it. This\n   problem
    is discussed in more detail in the informational RFC which\n   will be published
    as a supplement to this standard.\n   Within a multipart/related structure, each
    body part MUST have, if\n   assigned, a different Content-ID header value and
    a Content-Location\n   header field values which resolve to a different URI.\n
    \  Two body parts in the same multipart/related structure can have the\n   same
    relative Content-Location header value, only if when resolved to\n   absolute
    URIs they become different.\n"

    - "8.1 General principle\n   A body part, such as a text/html body part, may contain
      URIs that\n   reference resources which are included as body parts in the same\n
      \  message -- in detail, as body parts within the same multipart/related\n   structure.
      Often such URI linked resources are meant to be displayed\n   inline to the
      viewer of the referencing body part; for example,\n   objects referenced with
      the SRC attribute of the IMG element in HTML\n   2.0 [HTML2]. New elements and
      attributes with this property are\n   proposed in the ongoing development of
      HTML (examples: applet, frame,\n   profile, OBJECT, classid, codebase, data,
      SCRIPT). A sender might\n   also want to send a set of HTML documents which
      the reader can\n   traverse, and which are related with the attribute href of
      the A\n   element.\n   If a user retrieves and displays a web page formed from
      a text/html\n   resource, and the subsidiary resources it references, and merely\n
      \  saves the text/html resource, that user may not at a later time be\n   able
      to retrieve and display the web page as it appeared when saved.\n   The format
      described in this standard can be used to archive and\n   retrieve all of the
      resources required to display the web page, as it\n   originally appeared at
      a certain moment of time, in one aggregate\n   file.\n   In order to send or
      store complete such messages, there is a need to\n   specify how a URI in one
      body part can reference a resource in\n   another body part.\n"

  - contents:
    - "8.2 Resolution of URIs in text/html body parts\n   The resolution of inline,
      retrieval and other kinds of URIs in\n   text/html body parts is performed in
      the following way:\n   (a) Unfold multiple line header values according to [URLBODY].
      Do NOT\n       however translate character encodings of the kind described in\n
      \      [URL]. Example: Do not transform \"a%2eb/c%20d\" into \"a/b/c d\".\n
      \  (b) Remove all MIME encodings, such as content-transfer encoding and\n       header
      encodings as defined in MIME part 3 [MIME3] Do NOT however\n       translate
      character encodings of the kind described in [URL].\n       Example: Do not
      transform \"a%2eb/c%20d\" into \"a/b/c d\".\n   (c) Try to resolve all relative
      URIs in the HTML content and in\n       Content-Location headers using the procedure
      described in chapter\n       5 above. The result of this resolution can be an
      absolute URI, or\n       an absolute URI with the base \"thismessage:/\" as
      specified in\n       chapter 5.\n   (d) For each referencing URI in a text/html
      body part, compare the\n       value of the referencing URI after resolution
      as described in (a)\n       and (b), with the URI derived from Content-ID and
      Content-\n       Location headers for other body parts within the same or a\n
      \      surrounding Multipart/related structure. If the strings are\n       identical,
      octet by octet, then the referencing URI references\n       that body part.
      This comparison will only succeed if the two URIs\n       are identical. This
      means that if one of the two URIs to be\n       compared was a fictitious absolute
      URI with the base\n       \"thismessage:/\", the other must also be such a fictitious\n
      \      absolute URI, and not resolvable to a real absolute URI.\n   (e) If (d)
      fails, try to retrieve the URI referenced resource\n       hyperlink through
      ordinary Internet lookup. Resolution of URIs of\n       the URL-types \"mid\"
      or \"cid\" to other content-parts, outside the\n       same multipart/related
      structure, or in other separately sent\n       messages, is not covered by this
      standard, and is thus neither\n       encouraged nor forbidden.\n"

      other body parts in an MHTML\n   multipart/related structure, they MUST only
      be matched against\n   Content-ID header values, and not against Content-Location
      header\n   with CID: values. Thus, even though the following two headers are\n
      \  identical in meaning, only the Content-ID value will be matched, and\n   the

  - "10.  Character encoding issues and end-of-line issues\n   For the encoding of
    characters in HTML documents and other text\n   documents into a MIME-compatible
    octet stream, the following\n   mechanisms are relevant:\n   -  HTML [HTML2],
    [HTML-I18N] as an application of SGML [SGML] allows\n      characters to be denoted
    by character entities as well as by\n      numeric character references (e.g.
    \"Latin small letter a with\n      acute accent\" may be represented by \"&aacute;\"
    or \"&#225;\") in the\n      HTML markup.\n   -  HTML documents, in common with
    other documents of the MIME\n      Content-Type \"text\", can be represented in
    MIME using one of\n      several character encodings. The MIME Content-Type \"charset\"\n
    \     parameter value indicates the particular encoding used. For the\n      exact
    meaning and use of the \"charset\" parameter, please see\n      [MIME2] chapter
    4.\n      Note that the \"charset\" parameter refers only to the MIME\n      character
    encoding. For example, the string \"&aacute;\" can be sent\n      in MIME with
    \"charset=US-ASCII\", while the raw character \"Latin\n      small letter a with
    acute accent\" cannot.\n   The above mechanisms are well defined and documented,
    and therefore\n   not further explained here. In sending a message, all the above\n
    \  mentioned mechanisms MAY be used, and any mixture of them MAY occur\n   when
    sending the document in MIME format. Receiving user agents\n   (together with
    any Web browser they may use to display the document)\n   MUST be capable of handling
    any combinations of these mechanisms.\n   Also note that:\n   -  Any documents
    including HTML documents that contain octet values\n      outside the 7-bit range
    need a content-transfer-encoding applied\n      before transmission over certain
    transport protocols [MIME1,\n      chapter 5].\n   -  The MIME standard [MIME2]
    requires that e-mailed documents of\n      \"Content-Type: Text/ MUST be in canonical
    form before a Content-\n      Transfer-Encoding is applied, i.e. that line breaks
    are encoded as\n      CRLFs, not as bare CRs or bare LFs or something else.  This
    is in\n      contrast to [HTTP] where section 3.6.1 allows other\n      representations
    of line breaks.\n   Note that this might cause problems with integrity checks
    based on\n   checksums, which might not be preserved when moving a document from\n
    \  the HTTP to the MIME environment. If a document has to be converted\n   in
    such a way that a checksum based message integrity check becomes\n   invalid,
    then this integrity check header SHOULD be removed from the\n   document.\n   Other
    sources of problems are Content-Encoding used in HTTP but not\n   allowed in MIME,
    and character sets that are not able to represent\n   line breaks as CRLF. A good
    overview of the differences between HTTP\n   and MIME with regards to Content-Type:
    \"text\" can be found in [HTTP],\n   appendix C.\n   Some transport mechanisms
    may specify a default \"charset\" parameter\n   if none is supplied [HTTP, MIME1].
    Because the default differs for\n   different mechanisms, when HTML is transferred
    through e-mail, the\n   charset parameter SHOULD be included, rather than relying
    on the\n   default.\n"

    - "11.1 Security considerations not related to caching\n   It is possible for
      a message sender to misrepresent the source of a\n   multipart/related body
      part to a message recipient by labeling it\n   with a Content-Location URI that
      references another resource.\n   Therefore, message recipients should only interpret
      Content-Location\n   URIs as labeling a body part for the resolution of references
      from\n   body parts in the same multipart/related message structure, and not\n
      \  as the source of a resource, unless this can be verified by other\n   means.\n
      \  URIs, especially File URIs, if used without change in a message, may\n   inadvertently
      reveal information that was not intended to be revealed\n   outside a particular
      security context. Message senders should take\n   care when constructing messages
      containing the new header fields,\n   defined in this standard, that they are
      not revealing information\n   outside of any security contexts to which they
      belong.\n   Some resource servers hide passwords and tickets (access tokens
      to\n   information which should not be reveled to others) and other\n   sensitive
      information in non-visible  fields or URIs within a\n   text/html resource.
      \ If such a text/html resource is forwarded in an\n   email message, this sensitive
      information may be inadvertently\n   revealed to others.\n   Since HTML documents
      can either directly contain executable content\n   (i.e., JavaScript) or indirectly
      reference executable content (The\n   \"INSERT\" specification, Java). It is
      exceedingly dangerous for a\n   receiving User Agent to execute content received
      in a mail message\n   without careful attention to restrictions on the capabilities
      of that\n   executable content.\n   HTML-formatted messages can be used to investigate
      user behaviour,\n   for example to break anonymity, in ways which invade the
      privacy of\n   individuals. If you send a message with a inline link to an object\n
      \  which is not itself included in the message, the recipients mailer or\n   browser
      may request that object through HTTP. The HTTP transaction\n   will then reveal
      who is reading the message. Example: A person who\n   wants to find out who
      is behind an anonymous user identity, or from\n   which workstation a user is
      reading his mail, can do this by sending\n   a message with an inline link and
      then observe from where this link\n   is used to request the object.\n"
    title: 11.1 Security considerations not related to caching
  - contents:
    - "11.2 Security considerations related to caching\n   There is a well-known problem
      with the caching of directly retrieved\n   web resources. A resource retrieved
      from a cache may differ from that\n   re-retrieved from its source. This problem,
      also manifests itself\n   when a copy of a resource is delivered in a multipart/related\n
      \  structure.\n   When processing (rendering) a text/html body part in an MHTML\n
      \  multipart/related structure, all URIs in that text/html body part\n   which
      reference subsidiary resources within the same\n   multipart/related structure
      SHALL be satisfied by those resources and\n   not by resources from any another
      local or remote source.\n   Therefore, if a sender wishes a recipient to always
      retrieve an URI\n   referenced resource from its source, an URI labeled copy
      of that\n   resource MUST NOT be included in the same multipart/related\n   structure.\n
      \  In addition, since the source of a resource received in a\n   multipart/related
      structure can be misrepresented (see 11.1 above),\n   if a resource received
      in multipart/related structure is stored in a\n   cache, it MUST NOT be retrieved
      from that cache other than by a\n   reference contained in a body part of the
      same multipart/related\n   structure. Failure to honor this directive will allow
      a\n   multipart/related structure to be employed as a Trojan Horse. For\n   example,
      to inject bogus resources (i.e. a misrepresentation of a\n   competitor's Web
      site) into a recipient's generally accessible Web\n   cache.\n"

    in RFC 2110\n   The specification has been changed to show that the formats described\n
    \  do not only apply to multipart MIME in email, but also to multipart\n   MIME
    transferred through other protocols such as HTTP or FTP.\n   In order to agree
    with [RELURL], Content-Location headers in\n   multipart Content-Headings can
    now be used as a base to resolve\n   relative URIs in their component parts, but
    only if no base URI can\n   be derived from the component part itself. Base URIs
    in Content-\n   Location header fields in inner headings have precedence over
    base\n   URIs in outer multipart headings.\n   The Content-Base header, which
    was present in RFC 2110, has been\n   removed. A conservative implementor may
    choose to accept this header\n   in input for compatibility with implementations
    of RFC 2110, but MUST\n   never send any Content-Base header, since this header
    is not any more\n   a part of this standard.\n   A section 4.4.1 has been added,
    specifying how to handle the case of\n   sending a body part whose URI does not
    agree with the correct URI\n   syntax.\n   The handling of relative and absolute
    URIs for matching between body\n   parts have been merged into a single description,
    by specifying that\n   relative URIs, which cannot be resolved otherwise, should
    be handled\n   as if they had been given the URL \"thismessage:/\".\n"
