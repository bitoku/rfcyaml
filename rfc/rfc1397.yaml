- title: Abstract
  contents:
  - "Abstract\n   This document specifies the recommendation of the BGP Working Group\n\
    \   on default route advertisement support in BGP2 [1] and BGP3 [2]\n   versions\
    \ of the Border Gateway Protocol.\n   This recommendation only applies to BGP2\
    \ and BGP3 versions of the\n   Border Gateway Protocol since starting with the\
    \ BGP4 [3] version a\n   default route advertisement capability is built in the\
    \ protocol.\n"
- title: 1. Overview
  contents:
  - "1. Overview\n   The purpose of the default route advertisement capability is\
    \ to\n   advertise the IP address of a border gateway which can be used as the\n\
    \   default next hop to destinations that are not listed explicitly in\n   the\
    \ BGP peer's routing table.\n   This capability will allow routers, that are unable\
    \ to maintain a\n   complete routing table (e.g., due to its size) to learn a\
    \ border\n   gateway that is ready to handle the default traffic.  Also, in\n\
    \   contrast to static defaults, if there is more than one default\n   gateway,\
    \ this would make it possible for a BGP speaker to express a\n   preference for\
    \ one over the other.  It also reduces the need to\n   configure default routes\
    \ in routers.\n"
- title: 2. Default Route Advertisement
  contents:
  - "2. Default Route Advertisement\n   A default route is advertised in an UPDATE\
    \ message that carries\n   reachability information for network 0.0.0.0.  A Network\
    \ field of\n   such an UPDATE message must contain the IP address 0.0.0.0 as the\n\
    \   indication that it carries a default route.  The NEXT_HOP path\n   attribute\
    \ of such a message provides the IP address of a border\n   gateway that can be\
    \ used as a default next hop to destinations that\n   are not listed in the BGP\
    \ peer's routing table.  The value of the\n   ORIGIN attribute should be 2 (INCOMPLETE).\
    \  The AS_PATH attribute\n   should be constructed according to the same rules\
    \ that apply to a\n   conventional network advertisement.\n   If multiple default\
    \ routes are advertised by a BGP speaker,  the\n   INTER-AS-METRIC path attribute\
    \ can be included in the corresponding\n   UPDATE messages to express  preference\
    \ levels for entry points to the\n   same AS.\n   The UNREACHABLE path attribute\
    \ is used to indicate that a previously\n   advertised default route has become\
    \ unreachable.\n   UPDATE messages containing the default route advertisements\
    \ should be\n   handled according to the rules that apply to all other UPDATE\n\
    \   messages.  If multiple default route are acquired by a BGP speaker, a\n  \
    \ route is selected according to the local policies adopted by this BGP\n   speaker.\n"
