  - "1.  Introduction\n   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information
    Base (MIB)\n   for use with network management protocols.  In particular, it defines\n
    \  objects for managing Multiprotocol Label Switching - Transport\n   Profile
    (MPLS-TP) linear protection.\n   This MIB module should be used for configuring
    and managing MPLS-TP\n   linear protection for MPLS-TP Label Switched Paths (LSPs).\n
    \  At the time of this writing, Simple Network Management Protocol\n   (SNMP)
    SET is no longer recommended as a way to configure MPLS\n   networks as described
    in RFC 3812 [RFC3812].  However, since the MIB\n   module specified in this document
    is intended to work in parallel\n   with the MIB module for MPLS specified in
    [RFC3812] and the MIB\n   module for MPLS-TP Operations, Administration, and Maintenance
    (OAM)\n   identifiers in RFC 7697 [RFC7697], certain objects defined here are\n
    \  specified with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write or read-create so\n   that
    specifications of the base tables in [RFC3812] and [RFC7697] and\n   the new MIB
    module in this document are consistent.\n"

    please refer to section 7 of\n   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].\n   Managed objects are accessed
    via a virtual information store, termed\n   the Management Information Base or
    MIB.  MIB objects are generally\n   accessed through the Simple Network Management
    Protocol (SNMP).\n   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined
    in the\n   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB\n
    \  module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,\n   RFC

  - "4.  Overview\n   RFC 6378 [RFC6378] defines the protocol to provide a linear\n
    \  protection switching mechanism for MPLS-TP for a point-to-point LSP\n   within
    the protection domain bounded by the endpoints of the LSP.\n   RFC 7271 [RFC7271]
    describes alternative mechanisms to perform some\n   of the functions defined
    in [RFC6378] and also defines additional\n   mechanisms to provide operator control
    and experience that more\n   closely model the behavior of linear protection seen
    in other\n   transport networks.  Two modes are defined for MPLS-TP linear\n   protection
    switching: the Protection State Coordination (PSC) mode\n   and the Automatic
    Protection Switching (APS) mode, as specified in\n   [RFC6378] and [RFC7271],
    respectively.  The detailed protocol\n   specification of MPLS-TP linear protection
    is described in [RFC6378]\n   and [RFC7271].\n   This document specifies a MIB
    module for Label Edge Routers (LERs)\n   that support MPLS-TP linear protection
    as described in [RFC6378] and\n   [RFC7271].  Objects defined in this document
    are generally applied to\n   both the PSC mode and the APS mode.  If an object
    is valid for a\n   particular mode only, it is noted in the description for the
    object.\n"

    - "5.4.  The Table Structures\n   The MPLS-TP linear protection MIB module has
      four tables.  The tables\n   are as follows:\n   o  mplsLpsConfigTable\n      This
      table is used to configure MPLS-TP linear protection domains.\n      An MPLS-TP
      linear protection domain (or a protection domain) is\n      identified by mplsLpsConfigDomainIndex.
      \ A protection domain\n      consists of two LERs, as well as the working path
      and protection\n      path that connect the two LERs.  The objects in this table
      are\n      used to configure properties that are specific to the protection\n
      \     domain.  Two Maintenance Entities (MEs) MUST be defined for each\n      protection
      domain: one for the working path and the other for the\n      protection path.
      \ Therefore, two entries in the\n      mplsLpsMeConfigTable, which is for configuring
      the MEs used in\n      protection switching, are associated to one entry in
      this table.\n   o  mplsLpsStatusTable\n      This table provides the current
      status information of MPLS-TP\n      linear protection domains that have been
      configured on the system.\n      The entries in the mplsLpsStatusTable have
      an AUGMENTS\n      relationship with the entries in the mplsLpsConfigTable.
      \ When a\n      protection domain is configured or deleted in the\n      mplsLpsConfigTable,
      then the corresponding row of that session in\n      the mplsLpsStatusTable
      is automatically created or deleted,\n      respectively.\n   o  mplsLpsMeConfigTable\n
      \     This table is used to associate MEs to the protection domain.\n      Each
      protection domain requires two MEs.  One entry in the\n      mplsLpsConfigTable
      is associated with two entries in this table:\n      one for the working path
      and the other for the protection path of\n      the protection domain.  The
      mplsLpsMeConfigPath object in this\n      table indicates that the path is either
      the working path or the\n      protection path.  The ME is identified by mplsOamIdMegIndex,\n
      \     mplsOamIdMeIndex, and mplsOamIdMeMpIndex, which are the same index\n      values
      as the entry in the mplsOamIdMeTable defined in [RFC7697].\n      The relationship
      to the mplsOamIdMeTable is described in\n      Section 6.1.\n   o  mplsLpsMeStatusTable\n
      \     This table provides current information about the protection\n      status
      of MEs that have been configured on the system.  When an ME\n      is configured
      or deleted in the mplsLpsMeConfigTable, then the\n      corresponding row of
      that session in the mplsLpsMeStatusTable is\n      automatically created or
      deleted, respectively.\n"

    - "6.1.  Relationship to the MPLS OAM Identifiers MIB Module\n   Entries in the
      mplsOamIdMeTable [RFC7697] are extended by entries in\n   the mplsLpsMeConfigTable.
      \ Note that the nature of the \"extends\"\n   relationship is a sparse augmentation
      so that the entry in the\n   mplsLpsMeConfigTable has the same index values
      as the entry in the\n   mplsOamIdMeTable.  Each time that an entry is created
      in the\n   mplsOamIdMeTable for which the LER supports MPLS-TP linear\n   protection,
      a row is created automatically in the\n   mplsLpsMeConfigTable.\n   When a point-to-point
      transport path needs to be monitored, one ME is\n   needed for the path and
      one entry in the mplsOamIdMeTable will be\n   created.  But the ME entry in
      the mplsOamIdMeTable may or may not\n   participate in protection switching.
      \ If an ME participates in\n   protection switching, an entry in the mplsLpsMeConfigTable
      MUST be\n   created, and the objects in the entry indicate which protection\n
      \  domain this ME belongs to and whether this ME is for the working path\n   or
      the protection path.  If the ME does not participate in protection\n   switching,
      an entry in the mplsLpsMeConfigTable does not need to be\n   created.\n"

  - "7.  Example of Protection Switching Configuration\n   This example considers
    the protection domain configuration on an LER\n   to provide protection for a
    co-routed bidirectional MPLS tunnel.  For\n   the working path and protection
    path of the protection domain, two\n   Maintenance Entity Groups (MEGs) need to
    be configured, and each MEG\n   contains one ME for a point-to-point transport
    path.  For more\n   information on the mplsOamIdMegTable and the mplsOamIdMeTable,
    see\n   [RFC7697].\n   Although the example described in this section shows a
    way to\n   configure linear protection for MPLS-TP tunnels, this also indicates\n
    \  how the MIB values would be returned if they had been configured by\n   alternative
    means.\n   The following table configures a protection domain.\n   In the mplsLpsConfigTable:\n
    \  mplsLpsConfigEntry ::= SEQUENCE\n   {\n      -- Protection domain index (index
    to the table)\n      mplsLpsConfigDomainIndex  = 3,\n      -- Protection domain

  - "9.  Security Considerations\n   There are a number of management objects defined
    in this MIB module\n   with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.
    \ Such\n   objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network\n
    \  environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure\n   environment
    without proper protection opens devices to attack.  These\n   are the tables and
    objects and their sensitivity/vulnerability:\n   o  The mplsLpsConfigTable is
    used to configure MPLS-TP linear\n      protection domains.  Improper manipulation
    of the objects in this\n      table may result in different behaviors than what
    network\n      operators originally intended, such as delaying traffic switching\n
    \     or causing a race condition with server-layer protection after\n      network
    failure (mplsLpsConfigHoldOff), delaying or speeding up\n      reversion after
    recovering from network failure\n      (mplsLpsConfigWaitToRestore), unexpected
    traffic switching\n      (mplsLpsConfigCommand), or the discontinuance of the
    operation of\n      a protection switching control process (mplsLpsConfigMode,\n
    \     mplsLpsConfigProtectionType).\n   o  The mplsLpsMeConfigTable is used to
    assign each ME to either the\n      working path or the protection path.  Improper
    manipulation of\n      this object may result in the discontinuance of the operation
    of a\n      protection switching control process.\n   o  The notification is controlled
    by the mplsLpsNotificationEnable\n      object.  In the case of the discontinuance
    of a protection\n      switching control process, network operators may not be
    notified\n      if the mplsLpsNotificationEnable object is compromised.\n   Some
    of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a\n   MAX-ACCESS
    other than not-accessible) may be considered sensitive or\n   vulnerable in some
    network environments.  It is thus important to\n   control even GET and/or NOTIFY
    access to these objects and possibly\n   to even encrypt the values of these objects
    when sending them over\n   the network via SNMP.  These are the tables and objects
    and their\n   sensitivity/vulnerability:\n   o  The mplsLpsStatusTable and the
    mplsLpsMeStatusTable collectively\n      show the history and current status of
    the MPLS-TP linear\n      protection domains.  They can be used to estimate the
    performance\n      and qualities of networks configured to use MPLS-TP linear\n
    \     protection.  If an administrator does not want to reveal this\n      information,
    then these tables should be considered\n      sensitive/vulnerable.\n   SNMP versions
    prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.\n   Even if the network itself
    is secure (for example by using IPsec),\n   there is no control as to who on the
    secure network is allowed to\n   access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete)
    the objects in this\n   MIB module.\n   Implementations SHOULD provide the security
    features described by the\n   SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410]), and implementations
    claiming\n   compliance to the SNMPv3 standard MUST include full support for\n
    \  authentication and privacy via the User-based Security Model (USM)\n   [RFC3414]
    with the AES cipher algorithm [RFC3826].  Implementations\n   MAY also provide
    support for the Transport Security Model (TSM)\n   [RFC5591] in combination with
    a secure transport such as SSH\n   [RFC5592] or TLS/DTLS [RFC6353].\n   Further,
    deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is\n   NOT RECOMMENDED.  Instead,
    it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to\n   enable cryptographic security.  It
    is then a customer/operator\n   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity
    giving access to an\n   instance of this MIB module is properly configured to
    give access to\n   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate\n
    \  rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.\n"
