- title: 3.  Codec Requirements
  contents:
  - "3.  Codec Requirements\n   To ensure a baseline level of interoperability between\
    \ WebRTC\n   endpoints, a minimum set of required codecs are specified below.\
    \  If\n   other suitable audio codecs are available for the WebRTC endpoint to\n\
    \   use, it is RECOMMENDED that they also be included in the offer in\n   order\
    \ to maximize the possibility of establishing the session without\n   the need\
    \ for audio transcoding.\n   WebRTC endpoints are REQUIRED to implement the following\
    \ audio\n   codecs:\n   o  Opus [RFC6716] with the payload format specified in\
    \ [RFC7587].\n   o  PCMA and PCMU (as specified in ITU-T Recommendation G.711\
    \ [G.711])\n      with the payload format specified in Section 4.5.14 of [RFC3551].\n\
    \   o  [RFC3389] comfort noise (CN).  WebRTC endpoints MUST support\n      [RFC3389]\
    \ CN for streams encoded with G.711 or any other supported\n      codec that does\
    \ not provide its own CN.  Since Opus provides its\n      own CN mechanism, the\
    \ use of [RFC3389] CN with Opus is NOT\n      RECOMMENDED.  Use of Discontinuous\
    \ Transmission (DTX) / CN by\n      senders is OPTIONAL.\n   o  the 'audio/telephone-event'\
    \ media type as specified in [RFC4733].\n      The endpoints MAY send DTMF events\
    \ at any time and SHOULD suppress\n      in-band dual-tone multi-frequency (DTMF)\
    \ tones, if any.  DTMF\n      events generated by a WebRTC endpoint MUST have\
    \ a duration of no\n      more than 8000 ms and no less than 40 ms.  The recommended\
    \ default\n      duration is 100 ms for each tone.  The gap between events MUST\
    \ be\n      no less than 30 ms; the recommended default gap duration is 70 ms.\n\
    \      WebRTC endpoints are not required to do anything with tones (as\n     \
    \ specified in RFC 4733) sent to them, except gracefully drop them.\n      There\
    \ is currently no API to inform JavaScript about the received\n      DTMF or other\
    \ tones (as specified in RFC 4733).  WebRTC endpoints\n      are REQUIRED to be\
    \ able to generate and consume the following\n      events:\n         +------------+--------------------------------+-----------+\n\

    \   For all cases where the endpoint is able to process audio at a\n   sampling\
    \ rate higher than 8 kHz, it is RECOMMENDED that Opus be\n   offered before PCMA/PCMU.\
    \  For Opus, all modes MUST be supported on\n   the decoder side.  The choice\
    \ of encoder-side modes is left to the\n   implementer.  Endpoints MAY use the\
    \ offer/answer mechanism to signal\n   a preference for a particular mode or ptime.\n\
    \   For additional information on implementing codecs other than the\n   mandatory-to-implement\
    \ codecs listed above, refer to [RFC7875].\n"
- title: 4.  Audio Level
  contents:
  - "4.  Audio Level\n   It is desirable to standardize the \"on the wire\" audio\
    \ level for\n   speech transmission to avoid users having to manually adjust the\n\
    \   playback and to facilitate mixing in conferencing applications.  It\n   is\
    \ also desirable to be consistent with ITU-T Recommendations G.169\n   and G.115,\
    \ which recommend an active audio level of -19 dBm0.\n   However, unlike G.169\
    \ and G.115, the audio for WebRTC is not\n   constrained to have a passband specified\
    \ by G.712 and can in fact be\n   sampled at any sampling rate from 8 to 48 kHz\
    \ and higher.  For this\n   reason, the level SHOULD be normalized by only considering\n\
    \   frequencies above 300 Hz, regardless of the sampling rate used.  The\n   level\
    \ SHOULD also be adapted to avoid clipping, either by lowering\n   the gain to\
    \ a level below -19 dBm0 or through the use of a\n   compressor.\n   Assuming\
    \ linear 16-bit PCM with a value of +/-32767, -19 dBm0\n   corresponds to a root\
    \ mean square (RMS) level of 2600.  Only active\n   speech should be considered\
    \ in the RMS calculation.  If the endpoint\n   has control over the entire audio-capture\
    \ path, as is typically the\n   case for a regular phone, then it is RECOMMENDED\
    \ that the gain be\n   adjusted in such a way that an average speaker would have\
    \ a level of\n   2600 (-19 dBm0) for active speech.  If the endpoint does not\
    \ have\n   control over the entire audio capture, as is typically the case for\
    \ a\n   software endpoint, then the endpoint SHOULD use automatic gain\n   control\
    \ (AGC) to dynamically adjust the level to 2600 (-19 dBm0) +/-\n   6 dB.  For\
    \ music- or desktop-sharing applications, the level SHOULD\n   NOT be automatically\
    \ adjusted, and the endpoint SHOULD allow the user\n   to set the gain manually.\n\
    \   The RECOMMENDED filter for normalizing the signal energy is a second-\n  \
    \ order Butterworth filter with a 300 Hz cutoff frequency.\n   It is common for\
    \ the audio output on some devices to be \"calibrated\"\n   for playing back pre-recorded\
    \ \"commercial\" music, which is typically\n   around 12 dB louder than the level\
    \ recommended in this section.\n   Because of this, endpoints MAY increase the\
    \ gain before playback.\n"
- title: 5.  Acoustic Echo Cancellation (AEC)
  contents:
  - "5.  Acoustic Echo Cancellation (AEC)\n   It is plausible that the dominant near-to-medium-term\
    \ WebRTC usage\n   model will be people using the interactive audio and video\n\
    \   capabilities to communicate with each other via web browsers running\n   on\
    \ a notebook computer that has a built-in microphone and speakers.\n   The notebook-as-communication-device\
    \ paradigm presents challenging\n   echo cancellation problems, the specific remedy\
    \ of which will not be\n   mandated here.  However, while no specific algorithm\
    \ or standard will\n   be required by WebRTC-compatible endpoints, echo cancellation\
    \ will\n   improve the user experience and should be implemented by the endpoint\n\
    \   device.\n   WebRTC endpoints SHOULD include an AEC or some other form of echo\n\
    \   control.  On general-purpose platforms (e.g., a PC), it is common for\n  \
    \ the analog-to-digital converter (ADC) for audio capture and the\n   digital-to-analog\
    \ converter (DAC) for audio playback to use different\n   clocks.  In these cases,\
    \ such as when a webcam is used for capture\n   and a separate soundcard is used\
    \ for playback, the sampling rates are\n   likely to differ slightly.  Endpoint\
    \ AECs SHOULD be robust to such\n   conditions, unless they are shipped along\
    \ with hardware that\n   guarantees capture and playback to be sampled from the\
    \ same clock.\n   Endpoints SHOULD allow the entire AEC and/or the nonlinear processing\n\
    \   (NLP) to be turned off for applications, such as music, that do not\n   behave\
    \ well with the spectral attenuation methods typically used in\n   NLP.  Similarly,\
    \ endpoints SHOULD have the ability to detect the\n   presence of a headset and\
    \ disable echo cancellation.\n   For some applications where the remote endpoint\
    \ may not have an echo\n   canceller, the local endpoint MAY include a far-end\
    \ echo canceller,\n   but when included, it SHOULD be disabled by default.\n"
- title: 6.  Legacy VoIP Interoperability
  contents:
  - "6.  Legacy VoIP Interoperability\n   The codec requirements above will ensure,\
    \ at a minimum, voice\n   interoperability capabilities between WebRTC endpoints\
    \ and legacy\n   phone systems that support G.711.\n"
- title: 7.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "7.  Security Considerations\n   For security considerations regarding the codecs\
    \ themselves, please\n   refer to their specifications, including [RFC6716], [RFC7587],\n\
    \   [RFC3551], [RFC3389], and [RFC4733].  Likewise, consult the RTP base\n   specification\
    \ for RTP-based security considerations.  WebRTC security\n   is further discussed\
    \ in [WebRTC-SEC], [WebRTC-SEC-ARCH], and\n   [WebRTC-RTP-USAGE].\n   Using the\
    \ guidelines in [RFC6562], implementers should consider\n   whether the use of\
    \ variable bitrate is appropriate for their\n   application.  Encryption and authentication\
    \ issues are beyond the\n   scope of this document.\n"
