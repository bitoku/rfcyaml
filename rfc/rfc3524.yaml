- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   Resource reservation protocols assign network resources\
    \ to particular\n   flows of IP packets.  When a router receives an IP packet,\
    \ it applies\n   a filter in order to map the packet to the flow it belongs. \
    \ The\n   router provides the IP packet with the Quality of Service (QoS)\n  \
    \ corresponding to its flow.  Routers typically use the source and the\n   destination\
    \ IP addresses and port numbers to filter packets.\n   Multimedia sessions typically\
    \ contain multiple media streams (e.g. an\n   audio stream and a video stream).\
    \  In order to provide QoS for a\n   multimedia session it is necessary to map\
    \ all the media streams to\n   resource reservation flows.  This mapping can be\
    \ performed in\n   different ways.  Two possible ways are to map all the media\
    \ streams\n   to a single resource reservation flow or to map every single media\n\
    \   stream to a different resource reservation flow.  Some applications\n   require\
    \ that the former type of mapping is performed while other\n   applications require\
    \ the latter.  It is even possible that a mixture\n   of both mappings is required\
    \ for a particular media session.  For\n   instance, a multimedia session with\
    \ three media streams might require\n   that two of them are mapped into a single\
    \ reservation flow while the\n   third media stream uses a second reservation\
    \ flow.\n   This document defines the SDP [1] syntax needed to express how media\n\
    \   streams need to be mapped into reservation flows.  For this purpose,\n   we\
    \ use the SDP grouping framework [2] and define a new \"semantics\"\n   attribute\
    \ called Single Reservation Flow (SRF).\n"

  contents:
  - "1.1 Terminology\n   In this document, the key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"\
    REQUIRED\",\n   \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\", \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\"\
    , \"MAY\",\n   and \"OPTIONAL\" are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14,\
    \ RFC 2119\n   [3] and indicate requirement levels for compliant SIP\n   implementations.\n"
- title: 2.  SRF Semantics
  contents:
  - "2.  SRF Semantics\n   We define a new \"semantics\" attribute within the SDP\
    \ grouping\n   framework [2]: Single Reservation Flow (SRF).\n   Media lines grouped\
    \ using SRF semantics SHOULD be mapped into the\n   same resource reservation\
    \ flow.  Media lines that do not belong to a\n   particular SRF group SHOULD NOT\
    \ be mapped into the reservation flow\n   used for that SRF group.\n   Note that\
    \ an SRF group MAY consist of a single media line.  In that\n   case, following\
    \ the definition above, that media line will be mapped\n   into one reservation\
    \ flow.  That reservation flow will carry traffic\n   from that media line, and\
    \ from no other media lines.\n"
- title: 3. Applicability Statement
  contents:
  - "3. Applicability Statement\n   The way resource reservation works in some scenarios\
    \ makes it\n   unnecessary to use the mechanism described in this document.  Some\n\
    \   resource reservation protocols allow the entity generating the SDP\n   session\
    \ description to allocate resources in both directions (i.e.,\n   sendrecv) for\
    \ the session.  In this case, the generator of the\n   session description can\
    \ chose any particular mapping of media flows\n   and reservation flows.\n   The\
    \ mechanism described in this document is useful when the remote\n   party needs\
    \ to be involved in the resource reservation.\n"
- title: 4.  Examples
  contents:
  - "4.  Examples\n   For this example, we have chosen to use SIP [4] to transport\
    \ SDP\n   sessions and RSVP [5] to establish reservation flows.  However, other\n\
    \   protocols or mechanisms could be used instead without affecting the\n   SDP\
    \ syntax.\n   A user agent receives a SIP INVITE with the SDP below:\n      v=0\n\
    \      o=Laura 289083124 289083124 IN IP4 one.example.com\n      t=0 0\n     \
    \ c=IN IP4 192.0.0.1\n      a=group:SRF 1 2\n      m=audio 30000 RTP/AVP 0\n \
    \     a=mid:1\n      m=video 30002 RTP/AVP 31\n      a=mid:2\n   This user agent\
    \ uses RSVP to perform resource reservation.  Since\n   both media streams are\
    \ part of an SRF group, the user agent will\n   establish a single RSVP session.\
    \  An RSVP session is defined by the\n   triple:  (DestAddress, ProtocolId[, DstPort]).\
    \  Table 1 shows the\n   parameters used to establish the RSVP session.\n   If\
    \ the same user agent received an SDP session description with the\n   same media\
    \ streams but without the group line, it would be free to\n   map the two media\
    \ streams into two different RSVP sessions.\n      Session Number  DestAddress\
    \  ProtocolId  DstPort\n      ________________________________________________\n\
    \            1          192.0.0.1      UDP        any\n      Table 1: Parameters\
    \ needed to establish the RSVP session\n"
- title: 5.  IANA Considerations
  contents:
  - "5.  IANA Considerations\n   IANA has registered the following new \"semantics\"\
    \ attribute for the\n   SDP grouping framework [2].  It has been registered in\
    \ the SDP\n   parameters registry (http://www.iana.org/assignments/sdp-parameters)\n\
    \   under Semantics for the \"group\" SDP Attribute:\n   Semantics           \

- title: 6.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "6.  Security Considerations\n   An attacker adding group lines using the SRF\
    \ semantics to an SDP\n   session description could force a user agent to establish\
    \ a larger or\n   a smaller number of resource reservation flows than needed.\
    \  This\n   could consume extra resources in the end-point or degrade the quality\n\
    \   of service for a particular session.  It is thus STRONGLY RECOMMENDED\n  \
    \ that integrity protection be applied to the SDP session descriptions.\n   For\
    \ session descriptions carried in SIP, S/MIME is the natural choice\n   to provide\
    \ such end-to-end integrity protection, as described in RFC\n   3261 [4]. Other\
    \ applications MAY use a different form of integrity\n   protection.\n"
