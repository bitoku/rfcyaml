- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   IEEE Std 802.15.4 [IEEE802.15.4] is a standard, referred\
    \ to by RFC\n   4944 [RFC4944] and other documents, that enables very low-cost\
    \ and\n   low-power communications.  The standard defines numerous optional\n\
    \   Physical Layers (PHYs) operating in many different frequency bands\n   with\
    \ a simple and effective Medium Access Control (MAC).\n   IEEE Std 802.15.4 defines\
    \ Information Elements (IEs) that can be used\n   to extend 802.15.4 in an interoperable\
    \ manner.  An IE provides a\n   flexible, extensible, and easily implementable\
    \ method of\n   encapsulating information.  The general format of an IE as defined\
    \ in\n   Section 7.4 of IEEE Std 802.15.4-2015 [IEEE802.15.4] consists of an\n\
    \   identification (ID) field, a length field, and a content field.\n   Multiple\
    \ IEs may be concatenated, and elements with unknown ID values\n   in a list of\
    \ IEs can be skipped since their length is known.  IEs\n   provide a flexible\
    \ container for information that allows the addition\n   of new IE definitions\
    \ in future versions of the standard in a\n   backwards-compatible manner.\n \
    \  There are two different IE types, Header IE and Payload IE.  A Header\n   IE\
    \ is part of the MAC header; it is never encrypted, but it may be\n   authenticated.\
    \  Most of the Header IE processing is done by the MAC,\n   and IETF protocols\
    \ should not have any direct effect on that\n   processing.  A Payload IE is part\
    \ of the MAC payload and may be\n   encrypted and authenticated.\n   IETF protocols\
    \ will need to insert information in the 802.15.4\n   frames; the 802.15.4 standard\
    \ enables that by including one or more\n   payload IEs in the frame that will\
    \ contain the information.  For this\n   purpose, the IETF requests a dedicated\
    \ Payload IE from the IEEE\n   802.15 Assigned Numbers Authority (ANA) [IEEE802.15-ANA].\
    \  The\n   current 802.15 ANA database can be found at [IEEE802.15-ANA-DB].\n\
    \   The 802.15.4 operations manual [IEEE802.15-OPS] describes how a\n   Standards\
    \ Development Organization (SDO) may request an allocation of\n   one IE.  To\
    \ make this request the SDO has to provide (i) the reason\n   for the request,\
    \ (ii) a description of the protocol format that shows\n   an appropriate subtype\
    \ capability, and (iii) an agreement that only\n   one IE number will be allocated\
    \ for use by the SDO.\n   This document provides the information needed for the\
    \ request.\n"

  - "2.  Terminology\n    The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\"\
    , \"SHALL\n    NOT\", \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"NOT RECOMMENDED\"\
    ,\n    \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in this document are to be interpreted as\n \
    \   described in BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they\n    appear\

- title: 3.  Working Groups Benefiting from the IETF 802.15.4 IE
  contents:
  - "3.  Working Groups Benefiting from the IETF 802.15.4 IE\n   There are several\
    \ IETF working groups such as 6TiSCH, 6lo, and CoRE\n   that could benefit from\
    \ the IETF IE.  The 6TiSCH Working Group has\n   already expressed the need for\
    \ the IE; this allocation is expected to\n   satisfy that need.\n"
- title: 4.  IETF IE Subtype Format
  contents:
  - "4.  IETF IE Subtype Format\n   The maximum length of the Payload IE content is\
    \ 2047 octets, and the\n   802.15.4 frame contains a list of payload IEs.  A single\
    \ frame can\n   have multiple payload IEs, terminated with the payload IE terminator,\n\
    \   which may then be followed by the payload.\n   Since the 802.15.4 standard\
    \ defines a list of payload IEs along with\n   their structures, there is no need\
    \ for this document to specify the\n   internal nesting structure of the IETF\
    \ IE.  The Payload IE format of\n   802.15.4 standard contains the Length field.\
    \  The length of the\n   subtype content can be calculated from the 802.15.4 Payload\
    \ IE Length\n   field of the IETF IE.\n   The format of the IETF IE is as follows:\n\
    \                        1                   2                   3\n    0 1 2\
    \ 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1\n   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+\n\
    \   | Subtype ID    |                                               |\n   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+\
    \                                               |\n   ~                      \
    \ subtype content                         ~\n   |                            \
    \                                   |\n   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+\n\
    \                     Figure 1: IETF IE Subtype Format\n   o  Subtype ID is the\
    \ IANA-allocated number specifying the subtype of\n      the IETF IE.  Value 0\
    \ is reserved for future extensibility, i.e.,\n      in case a longer subtype\
    \ ID field is needed.\n   o  Subtype content is the actual content of the Information\
    \ Element,\n      and its length can be calculated from the Length field of the\
    \ IETF\n      IE.\n   One IEEE 802.15.4 frame MAY contain multiple IETF IEs with\
    \ the same\n   or different subtypes.\n"
- title: 5.  Request to Allocate an IETF IE
  contents:
  - "5.  Request to Allocate an IETF IE\n   Per the IETF's request, the IEEE 802.15\
    \ Working Group has allocated\n   an ID (5) for a Payload IE for IETF use.  The\
    \ IETF understands that\n   this is the only ID it will be issued.\n"
- title: 6.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "6.  Security Considerations\n   This document creates an IANA registry for IETF\
    \ IE subtype IDs (see\n   Section 7).  The security of the protocols using the\
    \ IEs MUST be\n   described in the documents requesting allocations from this\
    \ registry.\n   The IEEE Std 802.15.4 [IEEE802.15.4] contains methods in which\n\
    \   security of the IE can be enforced when a frame is received, but this\n  \
    \ is only per IE type.  Therefore, all IETF IEs will have the same\n   security-level\
    \ requirements regardless of the subtype ID used.  This\n   can cause issues if\
    \ different security processing would be needed and\n   any of those IEs would\
    \ need to be processed in the MAC level.  Since\n   all IETF protocols should\
    \ operate at a higher level than the MAC\n   level, the higher-layer processing\
    \ for these IEs SHOULD perform\n   separate security policy checking based on\
    \ the IETF IE subtype ID in\n   addition to the checks done by the MAC.\n"
- title: 7.  IANA Considerations
  contents:
  - "7.  IANA Considerations\n   The \"IEEE Std 802.15.4 IETF IE Subtype IDs\" registry\
    \ has been created\n   as follows:\n   Value     Subtype ID\n   0         Reserved\n\
    \   1-200     Unassigned\n   201-255   Experimental Use\n   Any change or addition\
    \ to this registry requires Expert Review\n   [RFC5226].\n   Note that there are\
    \ vendor-specific IEs already defined in IEEE\n   802.15.4 (see Appendix A); because\
    \ of this, there is no need to\n   reserve any subtype IDs for the vendor-specific\
    \ uses.\n"
