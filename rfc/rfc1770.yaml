  contents:
  - "Abstract\n   This memo defines an IPv4 option to provide a sender directed multi-\n\
    \   destination delivery mechanism called Selective Directed Broadcast\n   Mode\
    \ (SDBM).  The SDBM provides unreliable UDP delivery to a set of\n   IP addresses\
    \ included in the option field of an IPv4 datagram.  Data\n   reliability if required\
    \ will be provided by the application layer.\n   This approach was developed to\
    \ support sender directed multi-\n   destination delivery to sparsely populated\
    \ groups with no additional\n   control traffic.  This approach will find application\
    \ in the\n   extremely bandwidth constrained tactical military environment, as\n\
    \   well as in some commercial applications requiring sender control of\n   data\
    \ delivery.\n"
- title: Background
  contents:
  - "Background\n   The Selective Directed Broadcast Mode (SDBM) is an integral part\
    \ of\n   the U.S. Army standard for tactical data communication networks as\n\
    \   defined in MIL-STD-188-220() (Reference 1). The MIL-STD-188-220()\n   defines\
    \ a protocol architecture for the lower four layers of the\n   ISO-OSI Reference\
    \ model. The MIL-STD-188-220() is currently\n   undergoing a reformatting to be\
    \ consistent with other DoD standards\n   that deal with IP networking. These\
    \ efforts will provide tactical IP\n   internetting of tactical Army broadcast\
    \ radio networks, and will\n   support fully IP compliant internetworking to other\
    \ types of IP\n   networks via commercial IP routers.  It is the goal of the U.S.\
    \ Army\n   to move toward a fully IP compliant internetwork architecture for all\n\
    \   tactical battlefield data communications. The Army does, however,\n   have\
    \ a critical need for a reliable, sender directed multi-\n   destination data\
    \ transfer capability that is not currently supported\n   by the existing or emerging\
    \ internet standards. The SDBM IP option\n   was developed to meet this need.\
    \ The required data reliability will\n   be provided by incorporating an acknowledgement\
    \ strategy at the\n   application layer. It is hoped that this IP option, providing\
    \ multi-\n   destination capability not currently provided by the current and\n\
    \   emerging internet standards, will be embraced by the internet\n   community\
    \ and become an integal part of the IP family of protocols\n   and be incorporated\
    \ in commercial IP software products.\n"
- title: SDBM Format
  contents:
  - "SDBM Format\n   The SDBM provides the ability for an application to explicitly\
    \ list a\n   set of intended IP destinations. This capability will be implemented\n\
    \   as an option in the IP layer, as shown in Figure 1. This option field\n  \
    \ is variable in length, up to a maximum of 40 octets due to the\n   limitation\
    \ of the HLEN field as specified in STD 5, RFC 791\n   (Reference 2). Under this\
    \ option 38 of the 40 octets would be used to\n   contain the 2 octet control\
    \ field and a maximum of 9 IP addresses.\n       1            8           16 \

- title: Transmission of SDBM datagrams
  contents:
  - "Transmission of SDBM datagrams\n   The procedures for a source host, transit\
    \ router, and destination\n   router are provided below. When a source host has\
    \ a message to send\n   to multiple destination hosts, it shall,\n   a. Group\
    \ the destination host internet addresses by their network\n      identifiers\
    \ (Net IDs). If there are N distinct Net IDs, there will\n      be at least N\
    \ distinct directed broadcast packets. If there are\n      more that 9 destination\
    \ hosts on a single net, multiple directed\n      broadcast datagrams must be\
    \ sent to that net.\n   b. For each Net ID, form the directed broadcast address\
    \ as defined in\n      STD 3, RFC 1122 (Reference 3) for that network. The directed\n\
    \      broadcast address is used as the destination address in the IP\n      datagram\
    \ and the source address is the address of the host sending\n      the message.\n\
    \   c. Place the entire IP address for up to 9 destination hosts in the in\n \
    \     the same net in the option field defined above. The total length of\n  \
    \    all IP options in a given datagram is limited to 40 octets as\n      determined\
    \ by the HLEN (Header Length) field which defines the\n      number of 32 bit\
    \ words in the header. If other options are to be\n      included in addition\
    \ to the SDBM option, the number of addresses in\n      the option field must\
    \ be reduced accordingly.\n   d. The thusly formed datagram shall be transmitted\
    \ and processed\n      according to normal datagram handling procedures.\n   When\
    \ a IP SDBM datagram encounters a transit router (router not\n   connected to\
    \ the destination network), the datagram shall be\n   processed in accordance\
    \ with normal IP datagram handling procedures.\n   When encountering the destination\
    \ router (the destination network is\n   directly attached to the router), the\
    \ destination router shall\n   perform a, b or c below:\n   a. If the local subnet\
    \ has a broadcast capability, broadcast to all\n      hosts in the network and\
    \ let the hosts perform address filtering.\n   b. If the local subnet does not\
    \ support broadcast, form a local subnet\n      packet for each destination host\
    \ in the SDBM datagram and transmit\n      into the network.\n   c. If the local\
    \ subnet supports reliable layer 2 multi-address\n      capability as provided\
    \ by MIL-STD-188-220() networks, use a layer 2\n      multi-address frame to deliver\
    \ the datagram to addresses found in\n      the IP option field.\n"
- title: Reception of SDBM datagrams
  contents:
  - "Reception of SDBM datagrams\n   In processing received SDBM datagrams, receiving\
    \ hosts shall look\n   inside the IP option field for their address. Processing\
    \ shall\n   continue only if the host's IP address is found inside this option\n\
    \   field. Thus the source host has explicit control over which hosts\n   will\
    \ process its datagrams. Since SDBM uses a broadcast address in\n   its destination\
    \ field, the SDBM can only be used with UDP (Reference\n   4) and not TCP (Reference\
    \ 5) as the TCP supports only point-to-point\n   connections and not point-to-multi-point.\n"
