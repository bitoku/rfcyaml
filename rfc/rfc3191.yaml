    \  Telephone Network (GSTN) addresses (commonly called \"telephone\n   numbers\")
    in the local-part of Internet email addresses, along with\n   an extension mechanism
    to allow encoding of additional standard\n   attributes needed for email gateways
    to GSTN-based services.\n"

  - "1. Introduction\n   As with all Internet mail addresses, the left-hand-side (local-part)\n
    \  of an address generated according to this specification, is not to be\n   interpreted
    except by an MTA that handles messages for the domain\n   given in the right-hand-side.\n
    \  Since the very first e-mail to GSTN services gateway appeared, a\n   number
    of different methods to specify a GSTN address as an e-mail\n   address have been
    used by implementors.  Several objectives for this\n   methods have been identified,
    like to enable an e-mail user to access\n   GSTN services from his/her e-mail
    interface, to allow some kind of\n   \"GSTN over e-mail service\" transport (possibly
    reducing the costs of\n   GSTN long distance transmissions) while using the existing
    e-mail\n   infrastructure.\n   This memo describes the MINIMAL addressing method
    to encode GSTN\n   addresses into e-mail addresses and the standard extension
    mechanism\n   to allow definition of further standard elements.  The opposite\n
    \  problem, i.e., to allow a traditional numeric-only GSTN device user\n   to
    access the e-mail transport service, is not discussed here.\n   The IANA registration
    templates which MUST be used to register any\n   standard element defined according
    to this specification are given in\n   the \"IANA Considerations\" chapter (section
    7 of this document).\n   All implementations supporting this GSTN over e-mail
    service MUST\n   support as a minimum the specification described in this document.\n
    \  The generic complex case of converting the entirety of GTSN\n   addressing
    into e-mail is out of scope in this minimal specification.\n"

  - "2. Minimal GSTN address\n   The minimal specification of a GSTN address within
    an e-mail address\n   is as follows:\n      pstn-address = pstn-mbox  [ qualif-type1
    ]\n      pstn-mbox = service-selector \"=\" global-phone\n      service-selector
    = 1*( DIGIT / ALPHA / \"-\" )\n                         ; note that SP (space)
    is not allowed in\n                         ; service-selector.\n                         ;
    service-selector MUST be handled as a case\n                         ; INSENSITIVE
    string by implementations.\n   Other specifications adopting the \"pstn-address\"
    definition MUST\n   define and register with IANA a unique case insensitive\n
    \  \"service-selector\" element to identify the specific messaging service\n   involved.\n
    \  These specifications and registrations MUST also define which minimal\n   \"qualif-type1\"
    extensions, if any, MUST be supported for the\n   specified messaging service.\n
    \  Implementations confirming to this minimal requirements specification\n   are
    allowed to ignore any other non-minimal extensions address\n   element which is
    present in the \"pstn-address\".  However, conforming\n   implementations MUST
    preserve all \"qualif-type1\" address elements\n   they receive.\n   The generic
    \"qualif-type1\" element is defined as:\n      qualif-type1 = \"/\" keyword \"=\"
    string\n      keyword = 1*( DIGIT / ALPHA / \"-\" )\n                ; note that
    SP (space) is not allowed in keyword\n      string = PCHAR\n               ; note
    that printable characters are %x20-7E\n   As such, all \"pstn-address\" extension
    elements MUST be defined in the\n   \"qualif-type1\" form at the time of registration
    with IANA.\n"

    - "2.1 Minimal \"global-phone\" definition\n   The purpose of global-phone element
      is to represent standard E.164\n   numeric addresses [10] within a syntax for
      electronic mail addressing\n   that is compliant with standard e-mail specifications
      given in [1]\n   and [2].\n   The minimal supported syntax for global-phone
      element is as follows:\n      global-phone = \"+\" 1*( DIGIT / written-sep )\n
      \     written-sep = ( \"-\" / \".\" )\n   The use of other dialing schemes for
      GSTN numbers (like private\n   numbering plans or local dialing conventions)
      is also allowed.\n   However, this does not preclude nor remove the mandatory
      requirement\n   for support to the \"global-phone\" syntax within the minimal
      GSTN\n   address format.\n   Any other dialing schemes MUST NOT use the leading
      \"+\" defined here\n   between the \"=\" sign and the dialing string.  The \"+\"
      sign is\n   strictly reserved for the standard \"global-phone\" syntax.\n   Note:\n
      \     The specification of alternate dialing schemas is out of scope for\n      this
      minimal specification.\n   This document also permits the use of written-sep
      elements in order\n   to improve human readability of GSTN e-mail addresses.
      \ The\n   written-sep are elements which can be placed between dial elements\n
      \  such as digits etc.\n   Implementors' note:\n      Use of the written-sep
      elements is allowed, but not recommended\n      for transmission.  Any occurrences
      of written-sep elements in a\n      pstn-mbox MUST be ignored by all conformant
      implementations.\n"

    addresses\n   within the global e-mail transport system.  It also defines the\n
    \  standard extension mechanism to be used to introduce new elements for\n   GSTN
    addresses.\n   The proposal is consistent with existing e-mail standards.  Each\n
    \  specific GSTN service using this proposal MUST define and register\n   with
    IANA its own \"service-selector\" specification and MUST define\n   and register
    the eventual other \"qualif-type1\" elements needed for\n   its specific application.
    \ An example of such an application is\n   contained in reference [13].\n"
  title: 5. Conclusions
- contents:
  - "6. Security Considerations\n   This document specifies a means by which GSTN
    addresses can be\n   encoded into e-mail addresses.  Since e-mail routing is determined
    by\n   Domain Name System (DNS) data, a successful attack to DNS could\n   disseminate
    tampered information, which causes e-mail messages to be\n   diverted via some
    MTA or Gateway where the security of the software\n   has been compromised.\n
    \  There are several means by which an attacker might be able to deliver\n   incorrect
    mail routing information to a client.  These include: (a)\n   compromise of a
    DNS server, (b) generating a counterfeit response to\n   a client's DNS query,
    (c) returning incorrect \"additional\n   information\" in response to an unrelated
    query.  Clients SHOULD\n   ensure that mail routing is based only on authoritative
    answers.\n   Once DNS Security mechanisms [5] become more widely deployed, clients\n
    \  SHOULD employ those mechanisms to verify the authenticity and\n   integrity
    of mail routing records.\n"

  - "7. IANA Considerations\n   As the service-selector and qualif-type1 elements
    values are\n   extensible, they MUST be registered with IANA.\n   To register
    a service-selector or a qualif-type1 element, the\n   registration form templates
    given in 7.1 and 7.2 MUST be used. Any\n   new registration MUST fulfill the \"Specification
    Required\" criteria,\n   as defined in RFC 2434, section 2 [16]:\n     \"Specification
    Required - Values and their meaning MUST be\n      documented in an RFC or other
    permanent and readily available\n      reference, in sufficient detail so that
    interoperability between\n      independent implementations is possible.\"\n   IANA
    MUST NOT accept registrations which are not supplemented by a\n   Specification
    as defined above and which are not fully specified\n   according to the template
    forms given in 7.1 and 7.2.  In case of\n   need for further consultation about
    accepting a new registration,\n   IANA SHOULD refer to the Application Area Director
    to be directed to\n   the appropriate \"expert\" individual or IETF Working Group.\n
    \  After successful registration, IANA should publish the registered new\n   element
    in the appropriate on-line IANA WEB site, and include it into\n   the updates
    of the \"Assigned Numbers\" RFC series.\n   This section (including 7.1 and 7.2)

    that telephony systems do not conform any\n      more to the \"single/few\" Public
    Operator paradigm, the old\n      definition \"PSTN - Public Switched Telephone

    made clear that \"GSTN addresses\" correspond, in common\n      language, to \"telephone

    addresses;\n   -  an explicit list of \"new terms\" with explanations was added
    to\n      section 1.1;\n   -  the fact that any other specification adopting the
    \"pstn-address\"\n      definition MUST register with IANA the new \"service-selector\"
    and\n      \"qualif-type1\" elements was made explicit throughout the document;\n
    \     the relevant mechanism to be used was added in section 7 \"IANA\n      considerations\"
    (including the  IANA Registration form templates);\n      this is also consistent
