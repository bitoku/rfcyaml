  - "1.  Introduction\n   The Segment Routing (SR) architecture leverages the source-routing\n
    \  paradigm.  A segment represents either a topological instruction,\n   such
    as \"go to prefix P following shortest path\", or a service\n   instruction.  Other
    types of segments may be defined in the future.\n   A segment is identified through
    a Segment Identifier (SID).  An \"SR\n   domain\" is defined as a single administrative
    domain for global SID\n   assignment.  It may be comprised of a single Autonomous
    System (AS)\n   or multiple ASes under consolidated global SID administration.\n
    \  Typically, the ingress node of the SR domain prepends an SR header\n   containing
    SIDs to an incoming packet.\n   As described in [RFC8402], when SR is applied
    to the MPLS data plane\n   ([RFC8660]), the SID consists of a label.\n   [RFC8402]
    also describes how Segment Routing can be applied to an\n   IPv6 data plane (SRv6)
    using an IPv6 routing header containing a\n   stack of SR SIDs encoded as IPv6
    addresses [IPv6-SRH].  The\n   applicability and support for Segment Routing over
    IPv6 is beyond the\n   scope of this document.\n   A BGP Prefix Segment is a BGP
    prefix with a Prefix-SID attached.  A\n   BGP Prefix-SID is always a global SID
    ([RFC8402]) within the SR\n   domain and identifies an instruction to forward
    the packet over the\n   Equal-Cost Multipath (ECMP) best path computed by BGP
    to the related\n   prefix.  The BGP Prefix-SID is the identifier of the BGP Prefix\n
    \  Segment.  In this document, we always refer to the BGP Prefix Segment\n   by
    the BGP Prefix-SID.\n   This document describes the BGP extensions to signal the
    BGP Prefix-\n   SID.  Specifically, this document defines a BGP attribute known
    as\n   the \"BGP Prefix-SID attribute\" and specifies the rules to originate,\n
    \  receive, and handle error conditions for the attribute.\n   The BGP Prefix-SID
    attribute defined in this document can be attached\n   to prefixes from Multiprotocol
    BGP IPv4/IPv6 Labeled Unicast\n   ([RFC4760] [RFC8277]).  Usage of the BGP Prefix-SID
    attribute for\n   other Address Family Identifier (AFI) / Subsequent Address Family\n
    \  Identifier (SAFI) combinations is not defined herein but may be\n   specified
    in future specifications.\n   [RFC8670] describes example use cases where the
    BGP Prefix-SID is\n   used for the above AFI/SAFI combinations.\n   It should
    be noted that:\n   *  A BGP Prefix-SID will be global across ASes when the\n      interconnected
    ASes are part of the same SR domain.\n      Alternatively, when interconnecting
    ASes, the ASBRs of each domain\n      will have to handle the advertisement of
    unique SIDs.  The\n      mechanisms for such interconnection are outside the scope
    of the\n      protocol extensions defined in this document.\n   *  A BGP Prefix-SID
    MAY be attached to a BGP prefix.  This implies\n      that each prefix is advertised
    individually, reducing the ability\n      to pack BGP advertisements (when sharing
    common attributes).\n   The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\",
    \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"NOT RECOMMENDED\",
    \"MAY\", and\n   \"OPTIONAL\" in this document are to be interpreted as described
    in BCP\n   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all\n   capitals,
    as shown here.\n"
  title: 1.  Introduction
- contents:
  - "2.  MPLS BGP Prefix-SID\n   The BGP Prefix-SID is realized on the MPLS data plane
    ([RFC8660]) in\n   the following way:\n      The operator assigns a globally unique
    label index, L_I, to a\n      locally originated prefix of a BGP speaker N, which
    is advertised\n      to all other BGP speakers in the SR domain.\n      According
    to [RFC8402], each BGP speaker is configured with a\n      label block called
    the Segment Routing Global Block (SRGB).  While\n      [RFC8402] recommends using
    the same SRGB across all the nodes\n      within the SR domain, the SRGB of a
    node is a local property and\n      could be different on different speakers.
    \ The drawbacks of the\n      use case where BGP speakers have different SRGBs
    are documented in\n      [RFC8402] and [RFC8670].\n      If traffic engineering
    within the SR domain is required, each node\n      may also be required to advertise
    topological information and Peer\n      SIDs for each of its links and peers.
    \ This information is\n      required to perform the explicit path computation
    and to express\n      an explicit path as a list of SIDs.  The advertisement of\n
    \     topological information and peer segments (Peer SIDs) is done\n      through
    [BGPLS-SR-EPE].\n      If a prefix segment is to be included in an MPLS label
    stack,\n      e.g., for traffic-engineering purposes, knowledge of the prefix\n
    \     originator's SRGB is required in order to compute the local label\n      used
    by the originator.\n      This document assumes that Border Gateway Protocol -
    Link State\n      (BGP-LS) is the preferred method for a collecting both peer\n
    \     segments (Peer SIDs) and SRGB information through [RFC7752],\n      [BGPLS-SR-EPE],
    and [BGPLS-SR-EXT].  However, as an optional\n      alternative for the advertisement
    of the local SRGB without the\n      topology or the peer SIDs and, therefore,
    without applicability\n      for TE, the Originator SRGB TLV of the BGP Prefix-SID
    attribute is\n      specified in Section 3.2 of this document.\n      A BGP speaker
    will derive its local MPLS label L from the label\n      index L_I and its local
    SRGB as described in [RFC8660].  The BGP\n      speaker then programs the MPLS
    label L in its MPLS data plane as\n      its incoming/local label for the prefix.
    \ See Section 4.1 for more\n      details.\n      The outgoing label for the prefix
    is found in the Network Layer\n      Reachability Information (NLRI) of the Multiprotocol
    BGP IPv4/IPv6\n      Labeled Unicast prefix advertisement as defined in [RFC8277].
    \ The\n      label index L_I is only used as a hint to derive the local/\n      incoming
    label.\n      Section 3.1 of this document specifies the Label-Index TLV of the\n
    \     BGP Prefix-SID attribute; this TLV can be used to advertise the\n      label
    index for a given prefix.\n"

      if it is not specified in a\n   manner consistent with Section 6.\n   If a BGP
      speaker receives a node's SRGB as an attribute of the BGP-LS\n   Node NLRI and
      the BGP speaker also receives the same node's SRGB in a\n   BGP Prefix-SID attribute,
      then the received values should be the\n   same.  If the values are different,
      the values advertised in the BGP-\n   LS NLRI SHOULD be preferred, and an error

      BGP Labeled IPv4 or IPv6\n   Unicast ([RFC8277]) AFI/SAFI is required.\n   When
      the BGP Prefix-SID attribute is attached to a BGP Labeled IPv4\n   or IPv6 Unicast

      the Originator SRGB TLV.  A BGP Prefix-SID\n   attribute received without a
      Label-Index TLV MUST be considered to be\n   \"invalid\" by the receiving speaker.\n
      \  The label index provides guidance to the receiving BGP speaker as to\n   the
      incoming label that SHOULD be allocated to the prefix.\n   A BGP speaker may
      be locally configured with an SRGB=[SRGB_Start,\n   SRGB_End].  The preferred
      method for deriving the SRGB is a matter of\n   local node configuration.\n
      \  The mechanisms through which a given label-index value is assigned to\n   a
      given prefix are outside the scope of this document.\n   Given a label index
      L_I, we refer to (L = L_I + SRGB_Start) as the\n   derived label.  A BGP Prefix-SID
      attribute is designated\n   \"conflicting\" for a speaker M if the derived label
      value L lies\n   outside the SRGB configured on M.  Otherwise, the Label-Index
      TLV is\n   designated \"acceptable\" to speaker M.\n   If multiple different

      MUST have their BGP Prefix-SID\n   attribute considered to be \"conflicting\".\n
      \  If multiple valid paths for the same prefix are received from\n   multiple

      with a notable exception being when\n   [RFC5004] is being used to dampen route
      changes.\n   When a BGP speaker receives a path from a neighbor with an\n   \"acceptable\"
      BGP Prefix-SID attribute and that path is selected as\n   the best path, it
      SHOULD program the derived label as the label for\n   the prefix in its local
      MPLS data plane.\n   When a BGP speaker receives a path from a neighbor with
      an \"invalid\"\n   or \"conflicting\" BGP Prefix-SID attribute, or when a BGP
      speaker\n   receives a path from a neighbor with a BGP Prefix-SID attribute
      but\n   is unable to process it (e.g., local policy disables the\n   functionality),
      it MUST ignore the BGP Prefix-SID attribute.  For the\n   purposes of label
      allocation, a BGP speaker MUST assign a local (also\n   called dynamic) label
      (non-SRGB) for such a prefix as per classic\n   Multiprotocol BGP IPv4/IPv6
      Labeled Unicast ([RFC8277]) operation.\n   In the case of an \"invalid\" BGP
      Prefix-SID attribute, a BGP speaker\n   MUST follow the error-handling rules
      specified in Section 6.  A BGP\n   speaker SHOULD log an error for further analysis.
      \ In the case of a\n   \"conflicting\" BGP Prefix-SID attribute, a BGP speaker
      SHOULD NOT\n   treat it as an error and SHOULD propagate the attribute unchanged.
      \ A\n   BGP speaker SHOULD log a warning for further analysis, i.e., in the\n
      \  case the conflict is not due to a label-index transition.\n   When a BGP
      Prefix-SID attribute changes and transitions from\n   \"conflicting\" to \"acceptable\",
      the BGP Prefix-SID attributes for\n   other prefixes may also transition to
      \"acceptable\" as well.\n   Implementations SHOULD ensure all impacted prefixes
      revert to using\n   the label indices corresponding to these newly \"acceptable\"
      BGP\n   Prefix-SID attributes.\n   The outgoing label is always programmed as
      per classic Multiprotocol\n   BGP IPv4/IPv6 Labeled Unicast ([RFC8277]) operation.
      \ Specifically, a\n   BGP speaker receiving a prefix with a BGP Prefix-SID attribute
      and a\n   label NLRI field of Implicit NULL [RFC3032] from a neighbor MUST\n
      \  adhere to standard behavior and program its MPLS data plane to pop\n   the
      top label when forwarding traffic to the prefix.  The label NLRI\n   defines
      the outbound label that MUST be used by the receiving node.\n"

    all the occurrences of the attribute other\n   than the first one SHALL be discarded
    and the UPDATE message will\n   continue to be processed.  Similarly, if a recognized
    TLV appears\n   more than once in a BGP Prefix-SID attribute while the specification\n
    \  only allows for a single occurrence, then all the occurrences of the\n   TLV
    other than the first one SHALL be discarded and the Prefix-SID\n   attribute will
    continue to be processed.\n   For future extensibility, unknown TLVs MUST be ignored
    and propagated\n   unmodified.\n"
  title: 6.  Error Handling of BGP Prefix-SID Attribute
- contents:
  - "7.  IANA Considerations\n   This document defines a BGP path attribute known
    as the BGP Prefix-\n   SID attribute.  IANA has assigned attribute code type 40
    to the BGP\n   Prefix-SID attribute from the \"BGP Path Attributes\" registry.\n
    \  This document defines two TLVs for the BGP Prefix-SID attribute.\n   These
    TLVs have been registered with IANA.  IANA has created a\n   registry for BGP
    Prefix-SID Attribute TLVs as follows:\n   Under the \"Border Gateway Protocol
    (BGP) Parameters\" registry, the\n   new registry titled \"BGP Prefix-SID TLV
    Types\" has been created and\n   points to this document as the reference.\n   Registration
    Procedure(s):\n      Values 1-254, Expert Review as defined in [RFC8126]\n      Values
    0 and 255, Reserved\n   | Value | Type            | Reference     |\n   | 0     |
    Reserved        | This document |\n   | 1     | Label-Index     | This document
    |\n   | 2     | Deprecated      | This document |\n   | 3     | Originator SRGB
    | This document |\n   | 4-254 | Unassigned      |               |\n   | 255   |
    Reserved        | This document |\n        Table 1: BGP Prefix-SID TLV Types\n
    \  The value 2 previously corresponded to the IPv6 SID TLV, which was\n   specified
    in previous versions of this document.  It was removed, and\n   use of the BGP
    Prefix-SID for Segment Routing over the IPv6 data\n   plane [RFC8402] has been
    deferred to future specifications.\n   IANA has also created the \"BGP Prefix-SID
    Label-Index TLV Flags\"\n   registry under the \"Border Gateway Protocol (BGP)
    Parameters\"\n   registry, with a reference to this document.  Initially, this
    16-bit\n   flags registry is empty.  The registration policy for flag bits is\n
    \  Expert Review [RFC8126], consistent with the \"BGP Prefix-SID TLV\n   Types\"
    registry.\n   Finally, IANA has created the \"BGP Prefix-SID Originator SRGB TLV\n
    \  Flags\" registry under the \"Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) Parameters\"\n   registry,
    with a reference to this document.  Initially, this 16-bit\n   flags registry
    is empty.  The registration policy for flag bits is\n   Expert Review [RFC8126]
    consistent with the BGP Prefix-SID TLV Types\n   registry.\n   The designated
    experts must be good and faithful stewards of the\n   above registries, ensuring
    that each request is legitimate and\n   corresponds to a viable use case.  Given
    the limited number of bits\n   in the flags registries and the applicability to
    a single TLV,\n   additional scrutiny should be afforded to requests for flag-bit\n
    \  allocation.  In general, no single use case should require more than\n   one
    flag bit and, should the use case require more, alternate\n   encodings using
    new TLVs should be considered.\n"
  title: 7.  IANA Considerations
- contents:
  - "8.  Manageability Considerations\n   This document defines a BGP attribute to
    address use cases such as\n   the one described in [RFC8670].  It is assumed that
    advertisement of\n   the BGP Prefix-SID attribute is controlled by the operator
    in order\n   to:\n   *  Prevent undesired origination/advertisement of the BGP
    Prefix-SID\n      attribute.  By default, a BGP Prefix-SID attribute SHOULD NOT
    be\n      attached to a prefix and advertised.  Hence, BGP Prefix-SID\n      Advertisement
    SHOULD require explicit enablement.\n   *  Prevent any undesired propagation of
    the BGP Prefix-SID attribute.\n      By default, the BGP Prefix-SID is not advertised
    outside the\n      boundary of a single SR/administrative domain that may include
    one\n      or more ASes.  The propagation to other ASes MUST be explicitly\n      configured.\n
    \  The deployment model described in [RFC8670] assumes multiple ASes\n   under
    a common administrative domain.  For this use case, the BGP\n   Prefix-SID Advertisement
    is applicable to the inter-AS context, i.e.,\n   EBGP, while it is confined to
    a single administrative domain.\n"
  title: 8.  Manageability Considerations
- contents:
  - "9.  Security Considerations\n   This document introduces a BGP attribute (BGP
    Prefix-SID), which\n   inherits the security considerations expressed in: [RFC4271],\n
    \  [RFC8277], and [RFC8402].\n   When advertised using BGPsec as described in
    [RFC8205], the BGP\n   Prefix-SID attribute doesn't impose any unique security\n
    \  considerations.  It should be noted that the BGP Prefix-SID attribute\n   is
    not protected by the BGPsec signatures.\n   It should be noted that, as described
    in Section 8, this document\n   refers to a deployment model where all nodes are
    under the single\n   administrative domain.  In this context, we assume that the
    operator\n   doesn't want to leak any information related to internal prefixes
    and\n   topology outside of the administrative domain.  The internal\n   information
    includes the BGP Prefix-SID.  In order to prevent such\n   leaking, the common
    BGP mechanisms (filters) are applied at the\n   boundary of the SR/administrative
    domain.  Local BGP-attribute-\n   filtering policies and mechanisms are not standardized
    and,\n   consequently, are beyond the scope of this document.\n   To prevent a
    Denial-of-Service (DoS) or Distributed-Denial-of-Service\n   (DDoS) attack due
    to excessive BGP updates with an invalid or\n   conflicting BGP Prefix-SID attribute,
    error log message rate limiting\n   as well as suppression of duplicate error
    log messages SHOULD be\n   deployed.\n   Since BGP-LS is the preferred method
    for advertising SRGB\n   information, the BGP speaker SHOULD log an error if a
    BGP Prefix-SID\n   attribute is received with SRGB information different from
    that\n   received as an attribute of the same node's BGP-LS Node NLRI.\n"
