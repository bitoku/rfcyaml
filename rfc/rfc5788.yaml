  - "1.  Introduction\n   IMAP keywords [RFC3501] are boolean named flags that can
    be used by\n   clients to annotate messages in an IMAP mailbox.  Although IMAP\n
    \  keywords are an optional feature of IMAP, the majority of IMAP\n   servers
    can store arbitrary keywords.  Many mainstream IMAP clients\n   use a limited
    set of specific keywords, and some can manage (create,\n   edit, display) arbitrary
    IMAP keywords.\n   Over the years, some IMAP keywords have become de-facto standards,\n
    \  with some specific semantics associated with them.  In some cases,\n   different
    client implementors decided to define and use keywords with\n   different names,
    but the same semantics.  Some server implementors\n   decided to map such keywords
    automatically in order to improve cross-\n   client interoperability.\n   In other
    cases, the same keywords have been used with different\n   semantics, thus causing
    interoperability problems.\n   This document attempts to prevent further incompatible
    uses of IMAP\n   keywords by establishing an \"IMAP Keywords\" registry and allocating
    a\n   special prefix for standardized keywords.\n"

  - "3.  IANA Considerations\n   IANA has established a new registry for IMAP keywords.\n
    \  Registration of an IMAP keyword is requested by filling in the\n   following
    template and following the instructions on the IANA pages\n   for the registry
    to submit it to IANA:\n   Subject:    Registration of IMAP keyword X\n   IMAP
    keyword name:\n   Purpose (description):\n   Private or Shared on a server:  (One
    of PRIVATE, SHARED, or BOTH.\n                                   PRIVATE means
    that each different\n                                   user has a distinct copy
    of the\n                                   keyword.  SHARED means that all\n                                   different
    users see the same value of\n                                   the keyword.  BOTH
    means that an IMAP\n                                   server can have the keyword
    as either\n                                   private or shared.)\n   Is it an
    advisory keyword or may it cause an automatic action:\n   When/by whom the keyword
    is set/cleared:\n   Related keywords:  (for example, \"mutually exclusive with
    keywords Y\n                      and Z\")\n   Related IMAP capabilities:\n   Security
    considerations:\n   Published specification (recommended):\n   Person & email
    address to contact for further information:\n   Intended usage:  (One of COMMON,
    LIMITED USE, or DEPRECATED (i.e.,\n                    not recommended for use))\n
    \  Owner/Change controller:  (MUST be \"IESG\" for any \"common use\"\n                             keyword

    request MUST make it clear if\n                             the registration is
    controlled by a\n                             company, or the individual performing
    the\n                             registration.)\n   Note:       (Any other information
    that the author deems interesting\n               may be added here, for example,
    if the keyword(s) is\n               supported by existing clients.)\n   Registration
    of an IMAP keyword requires Expert Review [RFC5226].\n   Registration of any IMAP
    keyword is initiated by posting a\n   registration request to the Message Organization
    WG mailing list\n   <morg@ietf.org> (or its replacement as chosen by the responsible\n
    \  Application Area Director) and CCing IANA (<iana@iana.org>).  After\n   allowing
    for at least two weeks for community input on the designated\n   mailing list,
    the expert will determine the appropriateness of the\n   registration request
    and either approve or disapprove the request\n   with notice to the requestor,
    the mailing list, and IANA.  Any\n   refusal must come with a clear explanation.\n
    \  The IESG appoints one or more Expert Reviewers for the IMAP keyword\n   registry
    established by this document.\n   The Expert Reviewer should strive for timely
    reviews.  The Expert\n   Reviewer should take no longer than six weeks to make
    and announce\n   the decision, or notify the mailing list that more time is required.\n
    \  Decisions (or lack of) made by an Expert Reviewer can be first\n   appealed
    to Application Area Directors and, if the appellant is not\n   satisfied with
    the response, to the full IESG.\n   There are two types of IMAP keywords in the
    \"IMAP Keywords\" registry:\n   intended for \"common use\" and vendor-/organization-specific
    use (also\n   known as \"limited use\").  An IMAP keyword is said to be for \"common\n
    \  use\" if it is reasonably expected to be implemented in at least two\n   independent
    client implementations.  The two types of IMAP keywords\n   have different levels
    of requirements for registration (see below).\n"
  - contents:
    - "3.1.  Review Guidelines for the Designated Expert Reviewer\n   Expert Reviewers
      should focus on the following requirements.\n   Registration of a vendor-/organization-specific
      (\"limited use\") IMAP\n   keyword is easier.  The Expert Reviewer only needs
      to check that the\n   requested name doesn't conflict with an already registered
      name, and\n   that the name is not too generic, misleading, etc.  The Expert\n
      \  Reviewer MAY request the IMAP keyword name change before approving\n   the
      registration.  The Expert Reviewer SHOULD refuse a registration\n   if there
      is an already registered IMAP keyword that serves the same\n   purpose, but
      has a different name.\n   When registering an IMAP keyword for \"common use\",
      the Expert\n   Reviewer performs the checks described for vendor-/\n   organization-specific
      IMAP keywords, plus additional checks as\n   detailed below.\n   Keywords intended
      for \"common use\" SHOULD start with the \"$\" prefix.\n   (Note that this is
      a SHOULD because some of the commonly used IMAP\n   keywords in widespread use
      don't follow this convention.)\n   IMAP keywords intended for \"common use\"
      SHOULD be standardized in\n   IETF Review [RFC5226] documents.  (Note that IETF
      Review documents\n   still require Expert Review.)\n   Values in the \"IMAP
      Keywords\" IANA registry intended for \"common use\"\n   must be clearly documented
      and likely to ensure interoperability.\n   They must be useful, not harmful
      to the Internet.  In cases when an\n   IMAP keyword being registered is already
      deployed, Expert Reviewers\n   should favor registering it over requiring perfect
      documentation\n   and/or requesting a change to the name of the IMAP keyword.\n
      \  The Expert Reviewer MAY automatically \"upgrade\" registration requests\n
      \  for a \"limited use\" IMAP keyword to \"common use\" level.  The Expert\n
      \  Reviewer MAY also request that a registration targeted for \"common\n   use\"
      be registered as \"limited use\" instead.\n"
    title: 3.1.  Review Guidelines for the Designated Expert Reviewer
  - contents:
    - "3.2.  Comments on IMAP Keywords' Registrations\n   Comments on registered IMAP
      keywords should be sent to both the\n   \"owner\" of the mechanism and to the
      mailing list designated to IMAP\n   keyword review (see Section 3).  This improves
      the chances of getting\n   a timely response.\n   Submitters of comments may,
      after a reasonable attempt to contact the\n   owner and after soliciting comments
      on the IMAP mailing list, request\n   the designated Expert Reviewer to attach
      their comment to the IMAP\n   keyword registration itself.  The procedure is
      similar to requesting\n   an Expert Review for the affected keyword.\n"
    title: 3.2.  Comments on IMAP Keywords' Registrations
  - contents:
    - "3.3.  Change Control\n   Once an IMAP keyword registration has been published
      by IANA, the\n   owner may request a change to its definition.  The change request\n
      \  (including a change to the \"intended usage\" field) follows the same\n   procedure
      as the initial registration request, with the exception of\n   changes to the
      \"Person & email address to contact for further\n   information\" and \"Owner/Change
      controller\" fields.  The latter can be\n   changed by the owner by informing
      IANA; this can be done without\n   discussion or review.\n   The IESG may reassign
      responsibility for an IMAP keyword.  The most\n   common case of this will be
      to enable clarifications to be made to\n   keywords where the owner of the registration
      has died, moved out of\n   contact, or is otherwise unable to make changes that
      are important to\n   the community.\n   IMAP keyword registrations MUST NOT
      be deleted; keywords that are no\n   longer believed appropriate for use can
      be declared DEPRECATED by a\n   change to their \"intended usage\" field.\n
      \  The IESG is considered the owner of all \"common use\" IMAP keywords\n   that
      are published in an IETF Review document.\n"

    \   considerations, which are documented in the IMAP keyword\n    registration
    template standardized by this document.\n"
