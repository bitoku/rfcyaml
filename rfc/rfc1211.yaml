  - "1.  Introduction\n   Maintaining large mailing lists, especially the processing\
    \ of error\n   reports, poses many problems.  Most of the examples come from the\n\
    \   experience of managing the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)\n   mailing\
    \ list.  Many examples are presented in this memo.  Most of the\n   specific problems\
    \ shown have already been corrected.\n"
- title: 2. Discussion
  contents:
  - "2. Discussion\n   At USC - Information Sciences Institute (ISI) we maintain mailing\n\
    \   lists for the Internet Research Groups, the IETF, and other Internet\n   groups;\
    \ about 25 lists altogether.  We receive about 400 messages a\n   month requesting\
    \ additions or deletions to these lists.  There are\n   about 20 messages a day\
    \ requesting changes to the lists.\n   We also receive about 300 error messages\
    \ a month due to mail delivery\n   problems.  Many of these are duplicates, but\
    \ the net result is that\n   about 10 cases per day need to be investigated.\n\
    \   Many of the error reports are for \"soft errors\", primarily delayed\n   delivery\
    \ notices, such as \"not delivered for 2 days, will try for 3\n   more days\"\
    .  These just waste the list maintainer's time and are\n   otherwise ignored.\
    \  This is especially wasteful when such messages\n   are repeated every day.\
    \  However, if the same host is a cause of such\n   messages for many days in\
    \ a row, the list maintainer may investigate.\n   Please note that ignoring the\
    \ soft errors is not always easy, since\n   error messages often contain error\
    \ reports on several mailboxes,\n   requiring the error message to be read carefully\
    \ to pick out the hard\n   errors.\n   The error reports that indicate hard errors,\
    \ such as \"no such user\"\n   require the list maintainer to take action.  In\
    \ many cases the\n   appropriate action is to simply delete the user mailbox from\
    \ the\n   list.  However, if the mailbox in question is someone known to be\n\
    \   active as a working group chair, or such, further investigation is\n   necessary.\
    \  The more general case of \"no such host\" may be a\n   temporary condition,\
    \ but if it continues for several days it must be\n   investigated.\n   Since\
    \ the error conditions do not have standardized names (for\n   example, \"no such\
    \ user\" vs. \"user unknown\") it is sometimes difficult\n   to understand whether\
    \ a soft or hard error is being reported, and\n   what one should do about it.\
    \  For example, what does \"Can't Find Mail\n   Center!\" mean, or what should\
    \ one do about \"mailll:%MAIL-E-OPENOUT,\n   error opening SYS$USER2:[STGEORGE.LONGMAIL]MAIL$00040093BE236612.MAI;\n\
    \   as outputI)\"?\n   The first step in investigating a problem with a user mailbox\
    \ is to\n   see if it is on the list.  If so, the next step is to see if there\n\
    \   really is a problem with it.  This is done by using the SMTP VRFY and\n  \
    \ EXPN features, Finger, or Whois.  This often develops information\n   suggesting\
    \ that the user has recently changed his address.  This has\n   to be confirmed\
    \ through an exchange of messages (with the postmaster)\n   and then the mailing\
    \ list must be updated.\n   If the user is not on the list, then it is likely\
    \ the mail is sent\n   via an exploder or sublist.  So the investigation focuses\
    \ on finding\n   which exploder may be involved, usually this is found by looking\
    \ at\n   the path (from the received lines) of the error report.  The exploder\n\
    \   that is the source of the error can sometimes be checked using the\n   SMTP\
    \ EXPN feature.  Then the postmaster is notified.\n   If the error report is about\
    \ a host being unknown, the programs\n   \"whathost\", \"dig\", \"ping\", and\
    \ \"traceroute\" may be used to find the\n   problem.  However, getting the problem\
    \ fixed may require\n   communication with host and domain administrators.\n \
    \  What to do if problems can't be resolved: Delete the offending entry\n   from\
    \ the list that may eventually cause the following response: \"I\n   used to be\
    \ on the ietf list, how come I am not getting the messages\n   any more?\" (See\
    \ Appendix A.)\n"
- title: 3.  Typical Problems
  contents:
  - "3.  Typical Problems\n   In this section we discuss typical and frequent problems\
    \ that occur\n   with large mailing lists.\n"
- title: 3.1  Misdirected Error Reports
  contents:
  - "3.1  Misdirected Error Reports\n   The most frequent problem is that error reports\
    \ are sent to the\n   author of the message rather than the list owner.  One way\
    \ this can\n   happen is when there is trouble with the author's host not connecting\n\
    \   to another host along the route before it reaches ISI where the\n   mailing\
    \ list is.\n   At ISI the SMTP \"from\" information is added when the message\
    \ is\n   distributed to the list so that hosts following the SMTP protocol\n \
    \  will send their error reports to the list owner.  However, not all\n   hosts\
    \ do this properly.\n   Another problem is that some machines do not pay attention\
    \ to the\n   SMTP information about where to send error reports.\n"
- title: 3.2  Sublists
  contents:
  - "3.2  Sublists\n   What is a sublist?  It is a mailbox with an alias-name that\
    \ expands\n   to a mailing-list or group of recipients.  There are many sublists\
    \ on\n   our mailing lists.\n   When a user requests that a mailbox be added to\
    \ a list that looks\n   like an exploder, the following message is sent:\n   \
    \   We ask that all list maintainters of exploder mailboxes (an\n      alias-name\
    \ that expands to a mailing-list or group of recipients)\n      set up some sort\
    \ of ownership at their site, for their list.  What\n      this means is, is any\
    \ mailbox on your list is invalid, the error\n      message will go to you (the\
    \ list owner), and you can delete that\n      mailbox from your list.\n      An\
    \ example of an entry in your aliases file would be:\n         owner-ietf-local:\
    \  stev@vax.ftp.com,\n            (or your list maintainer/postmaster)\n   It\
    \ appears that few people understand the concept of list ownership,\n   or they\
    \ do not set it up correctly.  There is ample evidence of\n   problems in this\
    \ area.\n   When investigating \"user unknown\" messages it is often the case\
    \ that\n   the user is not individually listed on our list.  The next step is\
    \ to\n   check received lines and hunt for an exploder list with a host\n   similar\
    \ to the one that the error came from or points to.  At that\n   point we attempt\
    \ to use SMTP EXPN or VRFY to check that the user is\n   on a sublist.  Since\
    \ many hosts do not implement EXPN or VRFY, the\n   result of our check is inconclusive.\
    \  We then contact the list\n   maintainer and ask him to delete the invalid mailbox\
    \ if it is on his\n   sublist.\n   Another problem occurs when someone on a sublist\
    \ wants to change the\n   name of his mailbox.  We look through the main list\
    \ to make the\n   correction and if that mailbox is not on the list we check the\n\
    \   received lines and look for clues to determine which host this user\n   may\
    \ be on.  More than likely it is a sublist.  (See Appendix B.)\n   When the mailbox\
    \ is in another protocol world (like UUCP or BITNET)\n   there are often problems\
    \ with the handling and direction of error\n   reports. (See Appendix C.)\n  \
    \ Sometimes we are unable to find the addresses reported in the error\n   message\
    \ on the mailing list in question.  In such a case we check the\n   mailing list\
    \ for a host name also named in the received lines of a\n   message in error.\
    \  If we find a match then we look for an exploder on\n   that host and expand\
    \ the sublist there to see if the mailbox in\n   question is on that sublist.\
    \  (See Appendix D.)\n   At the time a sublist is entered into our list we record\
    \ the name of\n   the requestor and consider him the sublist owner.  As people\
    \ change\n   roles or companies this contact sometimes fails, in that case we\
    \ fall\n   back to contacting the postmaster.  However, not every site has a\n\
    \   \"postmaster\" mailbox. (See Appendix E.)\n   Most users send their requests\
    \ and changes to the IETF-Request\n   mailbox, when they are on, in fact, a sublist,\
    \ usually at their own\n   company.  This creates a problem for us trying to determine\
    \ which\n   exploder they're on.\n   In this case, the request message is forwarded\
    \ to the sublist owner\n   so he can make changes to his list.  However, sometimes\
    \ hosts may be\n   somewhat similar in name (from the same organization, but in\
    \ a\n   different department, in a different building, off campus, etc.) and\n\
    \   it's hard to know if this person should really be on that particular\n   sublist,\
    \ or listed individually.  Occasionally, we examine the main\n   file to see if\
    \ there are individual addresses that could be\n   incorporated in a sublist.\n"
- title: 3.3  Misdirected Requests
  contents:
  - "3.3  Misdirected Requests\n   Some users don't know that mailing lists usually\
    \ have a \"request\"\n   mailbox, so they mistakenly send their requests to the\
    \ main list.\n   When this happens, several people will resend the request to\
    \ the list\n   maintainer and then want to know if the request was completed.\n"
- title: 3.4  Misdirected Messages
  contents:
  - "3.4  Misdirected Messages\n   There are also messages that go to the request\
    \ mailbox when they are\n   intended for the main list.  These messages get forwarded\
    \ to the main\n   list and a message is sent to the user notifying him of the\n\
    \   correction and the proper way to address his message.\n"
- title: 4.  Summary
  contents:
  - "4.  Summary\n   Running a mailing list should be easy, and with small lists it\
    \ is.\n   The number of changes and errors are small and infrequent.  But when\n\
    \   lists get large and traffic gets heavy, the number of changes and\n   errors\
    \ grow to many a day.  The level of effort to manage a mailing\n   list of substantial\
    \ size and use becomes significant.\n   An additional problem is the creativity\
    \ shown by mail program\n   developers in inventing numerous different error reports.\
    \  We present\n   a large sample of such messages in Appendix F.  We hope that\
    \ these\n   examples will be of help to other mailing list maintainers.\n   Our\
    \ experience with maintaining large lists suggests the following:\n   Users: \
    \ Please be considerate and try to work problems out locally.\n   Sublist owners:\
    \  Please do everything you can to get the error\n   messages related to your\
    \ sublist to go to you.  Please try to get\n   users on your system to talk to\
    \ you about additions and deletions.\n                                APPENDIX\

    \ f.  Message From Coordinator\n   Date: Thu, 8 Nov 90 15:34:02 EST\n   From:\
    \ Doug Montgomery <dougm@warthog.ncsl.nist.gov>\n   Organization: National Institute\
    \ of Standards and Technology (NIST)\n   Sub-Organization: National Computer Systems\
    \ Laboratory\n   To: westine@ISI.EDU\n   Subject: RE:  421 osi3: Host osi3 is\
    \ down\n            550 Postmaster... User unknown\n   Cc: staff@osi3.ncsl.nist.gov\n\
    \   I think I have found out what is wrong.  For some reason (we can\n   discuss\
    \ this below)  your exploder is sending IETF mail to our\n   exploder (ietf@osi3.ncsl.nist.gov)\
    \ through the machine\n   osi.ncsl.nist.gov.  Now due to a recent subnet reconfiguration\
    \ and\n   subsequent lack of update to our DNS servers, the DNS was returning\n\
    \   an incorrect address for osi3. Thus IETF mail would be sent to OSI,\n   which\
    \ would try to forward it to OSI3 (using the wrong address).\n   OSI would think\
    \ that OSI3 was down and dump the message, trying to\n    send a notice to Postmaster.\
    \  OSI doesn't have an aliase for\n   Postmaster and thus the second error message\
    \ that you saw.\n    These two problems have been fixed on OSI.  Now the question\
    \ is what\n   address you have in your distribution list that would cause this\n\
    \   mail to go through OSI in the first place.  I guess you might have\n   something\
    \ like \"ietf%osi3@osi.ncsl.nist.gov.\" The other interesting\n   point about\
    \ your list is that we receive IETF mail to our exploder\n    directly from venera.\n\
    \    Thus I suspect that there are two entries for OSI3 on your\n   distribution\
    \ list.  One that gets relayed through OSI and one that\n   points directly to\
    \ OSI3.  If this is the case  please deleted\n    everything except the \"ietf@osi3.ncsl.nist.gov.\"\
    \ address.\n    If this is not the case or if there are other problems let me\
    \ know.\n"
