    \                        Internet Activities Board\n                         \
    \      February 1992\n   Over the last several years, the Internet has evolved\
    \ in size so\n   extensively that it has become infeasible to provide directory\n\
    \   services through a database maintained at a single, central\n   repository.\
    \  Both the size and the dynamics of the required data make\n   such an approach\
    \ impractical.  Recognizing this problem several years\n   ago [1], the Internet\
    \ community has adopted the Domain Name System\n   [2-5] as the principal means\
    \ of achieving host name to IP address\n   mappings.  During this time, almost\
    \ the entire Internet has converted\n   from the use of the static name-to-address\
    \ mapping tables thus far\n   centrally maintained at the DDN Network Information\
    \ Center, to the\n   use of the more dynamic, up-to-date address mapping provided\
    \ by DNS\n   mechanism.\n   There are still large fractions of the Internet community\
    \ which rely\n   on the use of a centrally-maintained file (\"hosts.txt\") to\
    \ accomplish\n   this mapping function.  The MILNET community appears to have\n\
    \   substantial pockets of dependence on table-driven mappings, for\n   example.\
    \  Although a plan for achieving a MILNET transition to use of\n   the Domain\
    \ Name System was worked out in 1987, the transition is\n   incomplete and, as\
    \ a result, naming services (i.e., host name lookups\n   on the MILNET) are many\
    \ times still provided via static tables rather\n   than the distributed, and\
    \ far more accurate, Domain Name System.\n   Ironically, most of the commercial,\
    \ off-the-shelf software for TCP/IP\n   supports the user of the Domain Name System,\
    \ so a policy of uniform\n   support and application of DNS would go a long way\
    \ toward improving\n   the Defense Department data communication infrastructure,\
    \ insofar as\n   it is dependent on TCP/IP to interconnect hosts on LANs and WANs.\n\
    \   The use of different means for name-to-address mappings by different\n   parties\
    \ in the network community leads to unsynchronized and\n   inconsistent databases,\
    \ which inevitably result in reachability\n   failures by users attempting to\
    \ connect to network resources.\n   Moreover, the special facilities of the Domain\
    \ Name System, such as\n   the MX (Mail eXchange) record, make it possible to\
    \ include systems\n   not directly on the Internet into the universe of addressable\n\
    \   parties.  MX records also allow a network administrator to prioritize\n  \
    \ a list of alternative e-mail relays in case the final destination is\n   not\
    \ reachable.  Systems which do not support MX records, but rather\n   still depend\
    \ on the \"hosts.txt\" information, pose a serious obstacle\n   to network connectivity,\
    \ as well as to the operation and management\n   of the highly connected Internet.\n\
    \   Non-DNS systems on the Internet will eventually be confronted with\n   the\
    \ need to decide whether they want to continue as a part of the\n   larger Internet\
    \ community, or remain a rather small, non-conforming\n   subset.  Should they\
    \ choose not to conform to the otherwise accepted\n   Domain Name System, they\
    \ will have to accept the ramifications of\n   this decision.  In particular,\
    \ they will have to accept that the rest\n   of the community may, indeed has\
    \ already started to, essentially\n   ignore those static files which reflect\
    \ the principal non-DNS naming\n   service.  The larger community has evolved\
    \ so extensively beyond\n   these configurations, that these files are not only\
    \ obsolete as a\n   technology, but also incomplete and often inaccurate in the\
    \ present\n   implementation.  Upon connecting a new host to the Internet, the\n\
    \   great majority of the Internet community no longer considers the\n   registration\
    \ of host name/address updates to the NIC database a\n   necessity, and rather\
    \ focuses on updating the Domain name System.\n   Therefore, today's NIC database,\
    \ and the \"hosts.txt\" file generated\n   from it, largely reflects only the\
    \ non-DNS community, a tiny subset\n   of the hundreds of thousands of entities\
    \ configured into the Internet\n   name space via the DNS.\n   If the non-DNS\
    \ users maintain a requirement for the use of static\n   mapping tables, at least\
    \ some mechanism should exist to augment the\n   NIC data sets with additional\
    \ information represented by the Domain\n   Name System.  These more comprehensive\
    \ tables, accompanied by a\n   method to guarantee synchronization with the DNS,\
    \ would significantly\n   improve the accuracy of the information which non-DNS\
    \ users apply to\n   map between names and addresses.  However, this solution\
    \ will not\n   address the need for support of the richer DNS functionality by\
    \ the\n   NIC's system.  At a minimum, the incorporation of MX information into\n\
    \   the NIC database is imperative for compatibility between the\n   \"hosts.txt\"\
    \ file and the DNS.  Network subcommunities which choose to\n   maintain a separate\
    \ and incompatible mapping system will have a\n   partitioning effect on the subcommunities\
    \ themselves, but also a\n   detrimental impact on overall Internet operations.\
    \  Both end-users\n   and system and network administrators will inevitably find\
    \ themselves\n   devoting considerable attention to tracing inconsistency problems\n\
    \   arising from the discrepancy in mapping methods.\n   The Internet Activities\
    \ Board, recognizing the need for universal\n   interoperability and consistent\
    \ naming mechanisms, and benefitting\n   from several years of experience with\
    \ the Domain Name System, is\n   advocating a policy that all connected components\
    \ of the Internet\n   community should adopt the DNS, and urges parties having\
    \ policy-\n   setting authority to adopt the same position and undertake to set\n\
    \   deadlines for conversion to uniform use of DNS.\n   References\n   1. J.B.\
