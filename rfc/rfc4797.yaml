  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   A \"conventional\" BGP/MPLS IP VPN [2] is characterized\
    \ as follows:\n      Each Provider Edge (PE) router maintains one or more Virtual\n\
    \      Routing and Forwarding (VRF) instances.  A VRF instances is a VPN-\n  \
    \    specific forwarding table.\n      PE routers exchange reachability information\
    \ with one another\n      using BGP [3] with multi-protocol extensions [4].\n\
    \      MPLS Label Switching Paths (LSPs) [5] connect PE routers to one\n     \
    \ another.\n   In simple configurations, the VPN service is offered by a single\n\
    \   Autonomous System (AS).  All service provider routers are contained\n   by\
    \ a single AS and all VPN sites attach to that AS.  When an ingress\n   PE router\
    \ receives a packet from a VPN site, it looks up the packet's\n   destination\
    \ IP address in a VRF that is associated with the packet's\n   ingress attachment\
    \ circuit.  As a result of this lookup, the ingress\n   PE router determines an\
    \ MPLS label stack, a data link header, and an\n   output interface.  The label\
    \ stack is prepended to the packet, the\n   data link header is prepended to that,\
    \ and the resulting frame is\n   queued for the output interface.\n   The innermost\
    \ label in the MPLS label stack is called the VPN route\n   label.  The VPN route\
    \ label is significant and visible to the egress\n   PE router only.  It controls\
    \ forwarding of the packet by the egress\n   PE router.\n   The outermost label\
    \ in the MPLS label stack is called the tunnel\n   label.  The tunnel label causes\
    \ the packet to be delivered to the\n   egress PE router that understands the\
    \ VPN route label.  Specifically,\n   the tunnel label identifies an MPLS LSP\
    \ that connects the ingress PE\n   router to the egress PE router.  In the context\
    \ of BGP/MPLS IP VPNs,\n   this LSP is called a tunnel LSP.\n   The tunnel LSP\
    \ provides a forwarding path between the ingress and\n   egress PE routers.  Quality\
    \ of service (QoS) information can be\n   mapped from the VPN packet to the tunnel\
    \ LSP header so that required\n   forwarding behaviors can be maintained at each\
    \ hop along the\n   forwarding path.\n   Sections 9 and 10 of reference [2] define\
    \ more complex configurations\n   (i.e., carriers' carrier and multi-AS backbones)\
    \ in which service\n   providers offer L3VPN services across multiple autonomous\
    \ systems.\n   In these configurations, VPN route labels can be stitched together\n\
    \   across AS boundaries.  Within each AS, tunnel LSPs carry VPN packets\n   from\
    \ network edge to network edge.\n   In most configurations, tunnel LSPs never\
    \ traverse AS boundaries.\n   The tunnel LSP is always contained within a single\
    \ AS.  In one\n   particular configuration (i.e., Inter-provider Option C), tunnel\
    \ LSPs\n   may traverse AS boundaries.\n   This memo describes procedures for\
    \ creating an MPLS packet that\n   carries the VPN route label, but does not carry\
    \ the tunnel label.\n   Then, using either GRE or IP encapsulation, the ingress\
    \ PE router\n   sends the MPLS packet across the network to the egress PE router.\n\
    \   That is, a GRE or IP tunnel replaces the tunnel LSP that was present\n   in\
    \ \"conventional\" BGP/MPLS IP VPNs.  Like the tunnel LSP, the GRE/IP\n   tunnel\
    \ provides a forwarding path between the ingress and egress PE\n   routers.  QoS\
    \ information can be copied from the VPN packet to the\n   GRE/IP tunnel header\
    \ so that required forwarding behaviors can be\n   maintained at each hop along\
    \ the forwarding path.  However, because\n   the GRE/IP tunnel lacks traffic engineering\
    \ capabilities, any traffic\n   engineering features provided by the tunnel LSP\
    \ are lost.\n"

- title: 3.  Motivation
  contents:
  - "3.  Motivation\n   \"Conventional\" BGP/MPLS IP VPNs require an MPLS Label Switched\
    \ Path\n   (LSP) between a packet's ingress PE router and its egress PE router.\n\
    \   This means that a BGP/MPLS IP VPN cannot be implemented if there is a\n  \
    \ part of the path between the ingress and egress PE routers that does\n   not\
    \ support MPLS.\n   In order to enable BGP/MPLS IP VPNs to be deployed even when\
    \ there\n   are non-MPLS routers along the path between the ingress and egress\
    \ PE\n   routers, it is desirable to have an alternative, which allows the\n \
    \  tunnel label to be replaced with either an IP or (IP + GRE) header.\n   The\
    \ encapsulation header would have the address of the egress PE\n   router in its\
    \ destination IP address field, and this would cause the\n   packet to be delivered\
    \ to the egress PE router.\n   In this procedure, the ingress and egress PE routers\
    \ themselves must\n   support MPLS, but that is not an issue, as those routers\
    \ must\n   necessarily have BGP/MPLS IP VPN support, whereas the transit routers\n\
    \   need not support MPLS or BGP/MPLS VPNs.\n"
- title: 4.  Specification
  contents:
  - "4.  Specification\n   In short, the technical approach specified here is:\n \
    \  1.  Continue to use MPLS to identify a VPN route, by continuing to\n      \
    \ add an MPLS label stack to the VPN packets.  Between the ingress\n       and\
    \ egress PE router, the outermost member of the label stack\n       will represent\
    \ the VPN route label.\n   2.  An MPLS-in-GRE or MPLS-in-IP [6] encapsulation\
    \ will be used to\n       turn the MPLS packet, described above, back into an\
    \ IP packet.\n       This, in effect, creates a GRE or an IP tunnel between the\n\
    \       ingress PE router and the egress PE router.\n   The net effect is that\
    \ an MPLS packet gets sent through a GRE or an\n   IP tunnel.\n   Service providers\
    \ must protect the above-mentioned IP or GRE tunnel\n   as recommended in Section\
    \ 8.2 of reference [6].  As stated in that\n   document:\n      \"If the tunnel\
    \ lies entirely within a single administrative\n      domain, address filtering\
    \ at the boundaries can be used to ensure\n      that no packet with the IP source\
    \ address of a tunnel endpoint or\n      with the IP destination address of a\
    \ tunnel endpoint can enter the\n      domain from outside.\n      However, when\
    \ the tunnel head and the tunnel tail are not in the\n      same administrative\
    \ domain, this may become difficult, and\n      filtering based on the destination\
    \ address can even become\n      impossible if the packets must traverse the public\
    \ Internet.\n      Sometimes only source address filtering (but not destination\n\
    \      address filtering) is done at the boundaries of an administrative\n   \
    \   domain.  If this is the case, the filtering does not provide\n      effective\
    \ protection at all unless the decapsulator of an\n      MPLS-in-IP or MPLS-in-GRE\
    \ validates the IP source address of the\n      packet.  This document does not\
    \ require that the decapsulator\n      validate the IP source address of the tunneled\
    \ packets, but it\n      should be understood that failure to do so presupposes\
    \ that there\n      is effective destination-based (or a combination of source-based\n\
    \      and destination-based) filtering at the boundaries.\"\n"
- title: 4.1.  MPLS-in-IP/MPLS-in-GRE Encapsulation by Ingress PE
  contents:
  - "4.1.  MPLS-in-IP/MPLS-in-GRE Encapsulation by Ingress PE\n   The following description\
    \ is not meant to specify an implementation\n   strategy; any implementation procedure\
    \ that produces the same result\n   is acceptable.\n   When an ingress PE router\
    \ receives a packet from a Customer Edge (CE)\n   router, it looks up the packet's\
    \ destination IP address in a VRF that\n   is associated with the packet's ingress\
    \ attachment circuit.  This\n   enables the (ingress) PE router to find a VPN-IP\
    \ route.  The VPN-IP\n   route will have an associated VPN route label and an\
    \ associated BGP\n   Next Hop.  The label is pushed on the packet.  Then an IP\
    \ (or IP+GRE)\n   encapsulation header is prepended to the packet, creating an\n\
    \   MPLS-in-IP (or MPLS-in-GRE) encapsulated packet.  The IP source\n   address\
    \ field of the encapsulation header will be an address of the\n   ingress PE router\
    \ itself.  The IP destination address field of the\n   encapsulation header will\
    \ contain the value of the associated BGP\n   Next Hop; this will be an IP address\
    \ of the egress PE router.  QoS\n   information can be copied from the VPN packet\
    \ to the GRE/IP tunnel\n   header so that required forwarding behaviors can be\
    \ maintained at\n   each hop along the forwarding path.\n   The IP address of\
    \ the remote tunnel endpoints MAY be inferred from\n   the Network Address of\
    \ the Next Hop field of the MP_REACH_NLRI BGP\n   attribute [4].  Note that the\
    \ set of Next Hop Network Addresses is\n   not known in advance, but is learned\
    \ dynamically via the BGP\n   distribution of VPN-IP routes.  Assuming a consistent\
    \ set of tunnel\n   capabilities exist between all the PEs and Autonomous System\
    \ Border\n   Routers (ASBRs), no a priori configuration of the remote tunnel\n\
    \   endpoints is needed.  The entire set of PE and ASBRs MUST have the\n   same\
    \ tunnel capabilities if the dynamic creation of IP (or GRE)\n   tunnels is desired.\
    \  The preference to use an IP (or GRE) tunnel MUST\n   be configured.  A set\
    \ of PEs using two or more tunnel mechanisms\n   (i.e., LSP, GRE, IP, etc.)  MUST\
    \ determine the tunnel type on a per-\n   peer basis.  The automatic association\
    \ of tunnel capabilities on a\n   per-peer basis is for future study.  Note that\
    \ these tunnels SHOULD\n   NOT be IGP-visible links, and routing adjacencies SHOULD\
    \ NOT be\n   supported across these tunnel.\n"
- title: 4.2.  MPLS-in-IP/MPLS-in-GRE Decapsulation by Egress PE
  contents:
  - "4.2.  MPLS-in-IP/MPLS-in-GRE Decapsulation by Egress PE\n   Every egress PE is\
    \ also an ingress PE, and hence has the ability to\n   decapsulate MPLS-in-IP\
    \ (or MPLS-in-GRE) packets.  After\n   decapsulation, the packets SHOULD be delivered\
    \ to the routing\n   function for ordinary MPLS switching.\n   As stated above,\
    \ if the service provider deploys source-based\n   filtering at network edges\
    \ to protect the IP/GRE tunnel (instead of\n   destination-based filtering), the\
    \ decapsulator must validate the IP\n   source address of the tunneled packets.\n"
- title: 5.  Implications on Packet Spoofing
  contents:
  - "5.  Implications on Packet Spoofing\n   It should be noted that if the tunnel\
    \ MPLS labels are replaced with\n   an unsecured IP encapsulation, like GRE or\
    \ IP, it becomes more\n   difficult to protect the VPNs against spoofed packets.\
    \  This is\n   because a Service Provider (SP) can protect against spoofed MPLS\n\
    \   packets by the simple expedient of not accepting MPLS packets from\n   outside\
    \ its own boundaries (or more generally, by keeping track of\n   which labels\
    \ are validly received over which interfaces, and\n   discarding packets that\
    \ arrive with labels that are not valid for\n   their incoming interfaces).\n\
    \   By contrast, protection against spoofed IP packets requires all SP\n   boundary\
    \ routers to perform filtering; either (a) filtering packets\n   from \"outside\"\
    \ the SP, which are addressed to PE routers, or (b)\n   filtering packets from\
    \ \"outside\" the SP, which have source addresses\n   that belong \"inside\" and,\
    \ in addition, filtering on each PE all\n   packets that have source addresses\
    \ that belong \"outside\" the SP.\n   The maintenance of these filter lists can\
    \ be management intensive.\n   Furthermore, depending upon implementation, these\
    \ filter lists can be\n   performance affecting.  However, such filters may be\
    \ required for\n   reasons other than protection against spoofed VPN packets,\
    \ in which\n   case the additional maintenance overhead of these filters to protect\n\
    \   (among other things) against spoofing of VPN packets may be of no\n   practical\
    \ significance.  Note that allocating IP addresses used for\n   GRE or IP tunnels\
    \ out of a single (or a small number of) IP block\n   could simplify maintenance\
    \ of the filters.\n"
