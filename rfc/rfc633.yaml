  - "                  IMP/TIP Preventive Maintenance Schedule\n   This note presents\
    \ the current IMP/TIP Preventive Maintenance\n   schedule.  Preventive Maintenance\
    \ is scheduled on a monthly basis and\n   a given machine is normally scheduled\
    \ at the same time each month;\n   wherever possible the time is chosen to coincide\
    \ with the PM time for\n   the Host(s) at the site.\n   It is sometimes necessary\
    \ to reschedule PM's because of network\n   connectivity considerations or for\
    \ other reasons.  Whenever this is\n   necessary we will follow the usual procedure\
    \ for scheduling down time\n   with our \"primary contact\" at the site.  Permanent\
    \ changes to the\n   schedule will he announced via the RFC mechanism.\n   PM's\
    \ normally do not require the IMP/TIP to be taken down.  However,\n   machines\
    \ must be taken down in some cases, so no one should rely on\n   the machine remaining\
    \ available through the PM period.\n   PLEASE REMEMBER THAT TUESDAY MORNINGS FROM\
    \ 7am TO 9am ARE RESERVED\n   FOR NETWORK SOFTWARE MAINTENANCE.\n   All times\
    \ shown below are Eastern Time.\n    First Monday (of each month)\n        BBN\
