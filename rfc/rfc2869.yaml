  - "1.  Introduction\n   RFC 2865 [1] describes the RADIUS Protocol as it is implemented\
    \ and\n   deployed today, and RFC 2866 [2] describes how Accounting can be\n \
    \  performed with RADIUS.\n   This memo suggests several additional Attributes\
    \ that can be added to\n   RADIUS to perform various useful functions.  These\
    \ Attributes do not\n   have extensive field experience yet and should therefore\
    \ be\n   considered experimental.\n   The Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP)\
    \ [3] is a PPP extension\n   that provides support for additional authentication\
    \ methods within\n   PPP.  This memo describes how the EAP-Message and Message-\n\
    \   Authenticator attributes may be used for providing EAP support within\n  \
    \ RADIUS.\n   All attributes are comprised of variable length Type-Length-Value\
    \ 3-\n   tuples.  New attribute values can be added without disturbing\n   existing\
    \ implementations of the protocol.\n"

  contents:
  - "1.1.  Specification of Requirements\n   The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\"\
    , \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\"\
    ,  \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n   document are to be interpreted as described\
    \ in RFC 2119 [4].\n   An implementation is not compliant if it fails to satisfy\
    \ one or more\n   of the must or must not requirements for the protocols it implements.\n\
    \   An implementation that satisfies all the must, must not, should and\n   should\
    \ not requirements for its protocols is said to be\n   \"unconditionally compliant\"\
    ; one that satisfies all the must and must\n   not requirements but not all the\
    \ should or should not requirements\n   for its protocols is said to be \"conditionally\
    \ compliant.\"\n   A NAS that does not implement a given service MUST NOT implement\
    \ the\n   RADIUS attributes for that service.  For example, a NAS that is\n  \
    \ unable to offer ARAP service MUST NOT implement the RADIUS attributes\n   for\
    \ ARAP.  A NAS MUST treat a RADIUS access-request requesting an\n   unavailable\
    \ service as an access-reject instead.\n"

  - "1.2.  Terminology\n   This document uses the following terms:\n   service   The\
    \ NAS provides a service to the dial-in user, such as PPP\n             or Telnet.\n\
    \   session   Each service provided by the NAS to a dial-in user\n           \
    \  constitutes a session, with the beginning of the session\n             defined\
    \ as the point where service is first provided and\n             the end of the\
    \ session defined as the point where service\n             is ended.  A user may\
    \ have multiple sessions in parallel or\n             series if the NAS supports\
    \ that, with each session\n             generating a separate start and stop accounting\
    \ record.\n   silently discard\n             This means the implementation discards\
    \ the packet without\n             further processing.  The implementation SHOULD\
    \ provide the\n             capability of logging the error, including the contents\
    \ of\n             the silently discarded packet, and SHOULD record the event\n\

- title: 2.1.  RADIUS support for Interim Accounting Updates
  contents:
  - "2.1.  RADIUS support for Interim Accounting Updates\n   When a user is authenticated,\
    \ a RADIUS server issues an Access-Accept\n   in response to a successful Access-Request.\
    \ If the server wishes to\n   receive interim accounting messages for the given\
    \ user it must\n   include the Acct-Interim-Interval RADIUS attribute in the message,\n\
    \   which indicates the interval in seconds between interim messages.\n   It is\
    \ also possible to statically configure an interim value on the\n   NAS itself.\
    \ Note that a locally configured value on the NAS MUST\n   override the value\
    \ found in an Access-Accept.\n   This scheme does not break backward interoperability\
    \ since a RADIUS\n   server not supporting this extension will simply not add\
    \ the new\n   Attribute. NASes not supporting this extension will ignore the\n\
    \   Attribute.\n   Note that all information in an interim message is cumulative\
    \ (i.e.\n   number of packets sent is the total since the beginning of the\n \
    \  session, not since the last interim message).\n   It is envisioned that an\
    \ Interim Accounting record (with Acct-\n   Status-Type = Interim-Update (3))\
    \ would contain all of the attributes\n   normally found in an Accounting Stop\
    \ message with the exception of\n   the Acct-Term-Cause attribute.\n   Since all\
    \ the information is cumulative, a NAS MUST ensure that only\n   a single generation\
    \ of an interim Accounting message for a given\n   session is present in the retransmission\
    \ queue at any given time.\n   A NAS MAY use a fudge factor to add a random delay\
    \ between Interim\n   Accounting messages for separate sessions. This will ensure\
    \ that a\n   cycle where all messages are sent at once is prevented, such as might\n\
    \   otherwise occur if a primary link was recently restored and many\n   dial-up\
    \ users were directed to the same NAS at once.\n   The Network and NAS CPU load\
    \ of using Interim Updates should be\n   carefully considered, and appropriate\
    \ values of Acct-Interim-Interval\n   chosen.\n"
- title: 2.2.  RADIUS support for Apple Remote Access Protocol
  contents:
  - "2.2.  RADIUS support for Apple Remote Access Protocol\n   The RADIUS (Remote\
    \ Authentication Dial-In User Service) protocol\n   provides a method that allows\
    \ multiple dial-in Network Access Server\n   (NAS) devices to share a common authentication\
    \ database.\n   The Apple Remote Access Protocol (ARAP) provides a method for\
    \ sending\n   AppleTalk network traffic over point-to-point links, typically,\
    \ but\n   not exclusively, asynchronous and ISDN switched-circuit connections.\n\
    \   Though Apple is moving toward ATCP on PPP for future remote access\n   services,\
    \ ARAP is still a common way for the installed base of\n   Macintosh users to\
    \ make remote network connections, and is likely to\n   remain so for some time.\n\
    \   ARAP is supported by several NAS vendors who also support PPP, IPX\n   and\
    \ other protocols in the same NAS. ARAP connections in these\n   multi-protocol\
    \ devices are often not authenticated with RADIUS, or if\n   they are, each vendor\
    \ creates an individual solution to the problem.\n   This section describes the\
    \ use of additional RADIUS attributes to\n   support ARAP. RADIUS client and server\
    \ implementations that implement\n   this specification should be able to authenticate\
    \ ARAP connections in\n   an interoperable manner.\n   This section assumes prior\
    \ knowledge of RADIUS, and will go into some\n   detail on the operation of ARAP\
    \ before entering a detailed discussion\n   of the proposed ARAP RADIUS attributes.\n\
    \   There are two features of ARAP this document does not address:\n      1. User\
    \ initiated password changing. This is not part of RADIUS,\n         but can be\
    \ implemented through a software process other than\n         RADIUS.\n      2.\
    \ Out-of-Band messages. At any time, the NAS can send messages to\n         an\
    \ ARA client which appear in a dialog box on the dial-in\n         user's screen.\
    \  These are not part of authentication and do not\n         belong here. However,\
    \ we note that a Reply-Message attribute in\n         an Access-Accept may be\
    \ sent down to the user as a sign-on\n         message of the day string using\
    \ the out-of-band channel.\n   We have tried to respect the spirit of the existing\
    \ RADIUS protocol\n   as much as possible, making design decisions compatible\
    \ with prior\n   art.  Further, we have tried to strike a balance between flooding\
    \ the\n   RADIUS world with new attributes, and hiding all of ARAP operation\n\
    \   within a single multiplexed ARAP attribute string or within Extended\n   Authentication\
    \ Protocol (EAP) [3] machinery.\n   However, we feel ARAP is enough of a departure\
    \ from PPP to warrant a\n   small set of similarly named attributes of its own.\n\
    \   We have assumed that an ARAP-aware RADIUS server will be able to do\n   DES\
    \ encryption and generate security module challenges.  This is in\n   keeping\
    \ with the general RADIUS goal of smart server / simple NAS.\n   ARAP authenticates\
    \ a connection in two phases. The first is a \"Two-\n   Way DES\" random number\
    \ exchange, using the user's password as a key.\n   We say \"Two-Way\" because\
    \ the ARAP NAS challenges the dial-in client\n   to authenticate itself, and the\
    \ dial-in client challenges the ARAP\n   NAS to authenticate itself.\n   Specifically,\
    \ ARAP does the following:\n      1. The NAS sends two 32-bit random numbers to\
    \ the dial-in client\n         in an ARAP msg_auth_challenge packet.\n      2.\
    \ The dial-in client uses the user's password to DES encrypt the\n         two\
    \ random numbers sent to it by the NAS. The dial-in client\n         then sends\
    \ this result, the user's name and two 32-bit random\n         numbers of its\
    \ own back to the NAS in an ARAP msg_auth_request\n         packet.\n      3.\
    \ The NAS verifies the encrypted random numbers sent by the\n         dial-in\
    \ client are what it expected. If so, it encrypts the\n         dial-in client's\
    \ challenge using the password and sends it back\n         to the dial-in client\
    \ in an ARAP msg_auth_response packet.\n   Note that if the dial-in client's response\
    \ was wrong,  meaning the\n   user has the wrong password, the server can initiate\
    \ a retry sequence\n   up to the maximum amount of retries allowed by the NAS.\
    \ In this case,\n   when the dial-in client receives the ARAP msg_auth_response\
    \ packet it\n   will acknowledge it with an ARAP msg_auth_again packet.\n   After\
    \ this first \"DES Phase\" the ARAP NAS MAY initiate a secondary\n   authentication\
    \ phase using what Apple calls \"Add-In Security\n   Modules.\"  Security Modules\
    \ are small pieces of code which run on\n   both the client and server and are\
    \ allowed to read and write\n   arbitrary data across the communications link\
    \ to perform additional\n   authentication functions.  Various security token\
    \ vendors use this\n   mechanism to authenticate ARA callers.\n   Although ARAP\
    \ allows security modules to read and write anything they\n   like, all existing\
    \ security modules use simple challenge and response\n   cycles, with perhaps\
    \ some overall control information.  This document\n   assumes all existing security\
    \ modules can be supported with one or\n   more challenge/response cycles.\n \
    \  To complicate RADIUS and ARAP integration, ARAP sends down some\n   profile\
    \ information after the DES Phase and before the Security\n   Module phase.  This\
    \ means that besides the responses to challenges,\n   this profile information\
    \ must also be present, at somewhat unusual\n   times.  Fortunately the information\
    \ is only a few  pieces of numeric\n   data related to passwords, which this document\
    \ packs into a single\n   new attribute.\n   Presenting an Access-Request to RADIUS\
    \ on behalf of an ARAP\n   connection is straightforward. The ARAP NAS generates\
    \ the random\n   number challenge, and then receives the dial-in client's response,\n\
    \   the dial-in client's challenge, and the user's name. Assuming the\n   user\
    \ is not a guest, the following information is forwarded in an\n   Access-Request\
    \ packet:  User-Name (up to 31 characters long),\n   Framed-Protocol (set to 3,\
    \ ARAP), ARAP-Password, and any additional\n   attributes desired, such as Service-Type,\
    \ NAS-IP-Address, NAS-Id,\n   NAS-Port-Type, NAS-Port, NAS-Port-Id, Connect-Info,\
    \ etc.\n   The Request Authenticator is a NAS-generated 16 octet random number.\n\
    \   The low-order 8 octets of this number are sent to the dial-in user as\n  \
    \ the two 4 octet random numbers required in the ARAP\n   msg_auth_challenge packet.\
    \ Octets 0-3 are the first random number and\n   Octets 4-7 are the second random\
    \ number.\n   The ARAP-Password in the Access-Request contains a 16 octet random\n\
    \   number field, and is used to carry the dial-in user's response to the\n  \
    \ NAS challenge and the client's own challenge to the NAS.  The high-\n   order\
    \ octets contain the dial-in user's challenge to the NAS (2 32-\n   bit numbers,\
    \ 8 octets) and the low-order octets contain the dial-in\n   user's response to\
    \ the NAS challenge (2 32-bit numbers, 8 octets).\n   Only one of User-Password,\
    \ CHAP-Password, or ARAP-Password needs to\n   be present in an Access-Request,\
    \ or one or more EAP-Messages.\n   If the RADIUS server does not support ARAP\
    \ it SHOULD return an\n   Access-Reject to the NAS.\n   If the RADIUS server does\
    \ support ARAP, it should verify the user's\n   response using the Challenge (from\
    \ the lower order 8 octets of the\n   Request Authenticator) and the user's response\
    \ (from the low order 8\n   octets of the ARAP-Password).\n   If that authentication\
    \ fails, the RADIUS server should return an\n   Access-Reject packet to the NAS,\
    \ with optional Password-Retry and\n   Reply-Messages attributes.  The presence\
    \ of Password-Retry indicates\n   the ARAP NAS MAY choose to initiate another\
    \ challenge-response cycle,\n   up to a total number of times equal to the integer\
    \ value of the\n   Password-Retry attribute.\n   If the user is authenticated,\
    \ the RADIUS server should return an\n   Access-Accept packet (Code 2) to the\
    \ NAS, with ID and Response\n   Authenticator as usual, and attributes as follows:\n\
    \      Service-Type of Framed-Protocol.\n      Framed-Protocol of ARAP (3).\n\
    \      Session-Timeout with the maximum connect time for the user in\n      seconds.\
    \  If the user is to be given unlimited time,\n      Session-Timeout should not\
    \ be included in the Access-Accept\n      packet, and ARAP will treat that as\
    \ an unlimited timeout (-1).\n      ARAP-Challenge-Response, containing 8 octets\
    \ with the response to\n      the dial-in client's challenge. The RADIUS server\
    \ calculates this\n      value by taking the dial-in client's challenge from the\
    \ high order\n      8 octets of the ARAP-Password attribute and  performing DES\n\
    \      encryption on this value with the authenticating user's password\n    \
    \  as the key. If the user's password is less than 8 octets in\n      length,\
    \ the password is padded at the end with NULL octets to a\n      length of 8 before\
    \ using it as a key. If the user's password is\n      greater than 8 octets in\
    \ length, an Access-Reject MUST be sent\n      instead.\n      ARAP-Features,\
    \ containing information that the NAS should send to\n      the user in an ARAP\
    \ \"feature flags\" packet.\n         Octet 0: If zero, user cannot change their\
    \ password. If non-\n         zero user can.  (RADIUS does not handle the password\
    \ changing,\n         just the attribute which indicates whether ARAP indicates\
    \ they\n         can.)\n         Octet 1: Minimum acceptable password length (0-8).\n\
    \         Octet 2-5: Password creation date in Macintosh format, defined\n   \
    \      as 32 bits unsigned representing seconds since Midnight GMT\n         January\
    \ 1, 1904.\n         Octet 6-9 Password Expiration Delta from create date in\n\
    \         seconds.\n         Octet 10-13: Current RADIUS time in Macintosh format\n\
    \      Optionally, a single Reply-Message with a text string up to 253\n     \
    \ characters long which MAY be sent down to the user to be displayed\n      in\
    \ a sign-on/message of the day dialog.\n      Framed-AppleTalk-Network may be\
    \ included.\n      Framed-AppleTalk-Zone, up to 32 characters in length, may be\n\
    \      included.\n      ARAP defines the notion of a list of zones for a user.\
    \  Along with\n      a list of zone names, a Zone Access Flag is defined (and\
    \ used by\n      the NAS) which says how to use the list of zone names. That is,\n\
    \      the dial-in user may only be allowed to see the Default Zone, or\n    \
    \  only the zones in the zone list (inclusive) or any zone except\n      those\
    \ in the zone list (exclusive).\n      The ARAP NAS handles this by having a named\
    \ filter which contains\n      (at least) zone names.  This solves the problem\
    \ where a single\n      RADIUS server is managing disparate NAS clients who may\
    \ not be\n      able to \"see\" all of the zone names in a user zone list.  Zone\n\
    \      names only have meaning \"at the NAS.\" The disadvantage of this\n    \
    \  approach is that zone filters must be set up on the NAS somehow,\n      then\
    \ referenced by the RADIUS Filter-Id.\n      ARAP-Zone-Access contains an integer\
    \ which specifies how the \"zone\n      list\" for this user should be used. \
    \ If this attribute is present\n      and the value is 2 or 4 then a Filter-Id\
    \ must also be present to\n      name a zone list filter to apply the access flag\
    \ to.\n      The inclusion of a Callback-Number or Callback-Id attribute in the\n\
    \      Access-Accept MAY cause the ARAP NAS to disconnect after sending\n    \
    \  the Feature Flags to begin callback processing in an ARAP specific\n      way.\n\
    \   Other attributes may be present in the Access-Accept packet as well.\n   An\
    \ ARAP NAS will need other information to finish bringing up the\n   connection\
    \ to the dial in client, but this information can be\n   provided by the ARAP\
    \ NAS without any help from RADIUS, either through\n   configuration by SNMP,\
    \ a NAS administration program, or deduced by\n   the AppleTalk stack in the NAS.\
    \ Specifically:\n      1. AppearAsNet and AppearAsNode values, sent to the client\
    \ to tell\n         it what network and node numbers it should use in its datagram\n\
    \         packets.  AppearAsNet can be taken from the Framed-AppleTalk-\n    \
    \     Network attribute or from the configuration or AppleTalk stack\n       \
    \  onthe NAS.\n      2. The \"default\" zone - that is the name of the AppleTalk\
    \ zone in\n         which the dial-in client will appear.  (Or can be specified\n\
    \         with the Framed-AppleTalk-Zone attribute.)\n      3. Other very NAS\
    \ specific stuff such as the name of the NAS, and\n         smartbuffering information.\
    \  (Smartbuffering is an ARAP\n         mechanism for replacing common AppleTalk\
    \ datagrams with small\n         tokens, to improve slow link performance in a\
    \ few common\n         traffic situations.)\n      4. \"Zone List\" information\
    \ for this user.  The ARAP specification\n         defines a \"zone count\" field\
    \ which is actually unused.\n   RADIUS supports ARAP Security Modules in the following\
    \ manner.\n   After DES authentication has been completed, the RADIUS server may\n\
    \   instruct the ARAP NAS to run one or more security modules for the\n   dial-in\
    \ user. Although the underlying protocol supports executing\n   multiple security\
    \ modules in series, in practice all current\n   implementations only allow executing\
    \ one.  Through the use of\n   multiple Access-Challenge requests, multiple modules\
    \ can be\n   supported, but this facility will probably never be used.\n   We\
    \ also assume that, even though ARAP allows a free-form dialog\n   between security\
    \ modules on each end of the point-to-point link, in\n   actual practice all security\
    \ modules can be reduced to a simple\n   challenge/response cycle.\n   If the\
    \ RADIUS server wishes to instruct the ARAP NAS to run a\n   security module,\
    \ it should send an Access-Challenge packet to the NAS\n   with (optionally) the\
    \ State attribute, plus the ARAP-Challenge-\n   Response, ARAP-Features, and two\
    \ more attributes:\n   ARAP-Security: a four octet security module signature,\
    \ containing a\n   Macintosh OSType.\n   ARAP-Security-Data, a string to carry\
    \ the actual security module\n   challenge and response.\n   When the security\
    \ module finishes executing, the security module\n   response is passed  in an\
    \ ARAP-Security-Data attribute from the NAS\n   to the RADIUS server in a second\
    \ Access-Request, also including the\n   State from the Access-Challenge.  The\
    \ authenticator field contains no\n   special information in this case, and this\
    \ can be discerned by the\n   presence of the State attribute.\n"
- title: 2.3.  RADIUS Support for Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP)
  contents:
  - "2.3.  RADIUS Support for Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP)\n   The Extensible\
    \ Authentication Protocol (EAP), described in [3],\n   provides a standard mechanism\
    \ for support of additional\n   authentication methods within PPP.  Through the\
    \ use of EAP, support\n   for a number of authentication schemes may be added,\
    \ including smart\n   cards, Kerberos, Public Key, One Time Passwords, and others.\
    \  In\n   order to provide for support of EAP within RADIUS, two new\n   attributes,\
    \ EAP-Message and Message-Authenticator, are introduced in\n   this document.\
    \ This section describes how these new attributes may be\n   used for providing\
    \ EAP support within RADIUS.\n   In the proposed scheme, the RADIUS server is\
    \ used to shuttle RADIUS-\n   encapsulated EAP Packets between the NAS and a backend\
    \ security\n   server. While the conversation between the RADIUS server and the\n\
    \   backend security server will typically occur using a proprietary\n   protocol\
    \ developed by the backend security server vendor, it is also\n   possible to\
    \ use RADIUS-encapsulated EAP via the EAP-Message\n   attribute.  This has the\
    \ advantage of allowing the RADIUS server to\n   support EAP without the need\
    \ for authentication-specific code, which\n   can instead reside on the backend\
    \ security server.\n"
- title: 2.3.1.  Protocol Overview
  contents:
  - "2.3.1.  Protocol Overview\n   The EAP conversation between the authenticating\
    \ peer (dial-in user)\n   and the NAS begins with the negotiation of EAP within\
    \ LCP.  Once EAP\n   has been negotiated, the NAS MUST send an EAP-Request/Identity\n\
    \   message to the authenticating peer, unless identity is determined via\n  \
    \ some other means such as Called-Station-Id or Calling-Station-Id.\n   The peer\
    \ will then respond with an EAP-Response/Identity which the\n   the NAS will then\
    \ forward to the RADIUS server in the EAP-Message\n   attribute of a RADIUS Access-Request\
    \ packet. The RADIUS Server will\n   typically use the EAP-Response/Identity to\
    \ determine which EAP type\n   is to be applied to the user.\n   In order to permit\
    \ non-EAP aware RADIUS proxies to forward the\n   Access-Request packet, if the\
    \ NAS sends the EAP-Request/Identity, the\n   NAS MUST copy the contents of the\
    \ EAP-Response/Identity into the\n   User-Name attribute and MUST include the\
    \ EAP-Response/Identity in the\n   User-Name attribute in every subsequent Access-Request.\
    \ NAS-Port or\n   NAS-Port-Id SHOULD be included in the attributes issued by the\
    \ NAS in\n   the Access-Request packet, and either NAS-Identifier or NAS-IP-\n\
    \   Address MUST be included.  In order to permit forwarding of the\n   Access-Reply\
    \ by EAP-unaware proxies, if a User-Name attribute was\n   included in an Access-Request,\
    \ the RADIUS Server MUST include the\n   User-Name attribute in subsequent Access-Accept\
    \ packets. Without the\n   User-Name attribute, accounting and billing becomes\
    \ very difficult to\n   manage.\n   If identity is determined via another means\
    \ such as Called-Station-Id\n   or Calling-Station-Id, the NAS MUST include these\
    \ identifying\n   attributes in every Access-Request.\n   While this approach\
    \ will save a round-trip, it cannot be universally\n   employed.  There are circumstances\
    \ in which the user's identity may\n   not be needed (such as when authentication\
    \ and accounting is handled\n   based on Called-Station-Id or Calling-Station-Id),\
    \ and therefore an\n   EAP-Request/Identity packet may not necessarily be issued\
    \ by the NAS\n   to the authenticating peer. In cases where an EAP-Request/Identity\n\
    \   packet will not be sent, the NAS will send to the RADIUS server a\n   RADIUS\
    \ Access-Request packet containing an EAP-Message attribute\n   signifying EAP-Start.\
    \ EAP-Start is indicated by sending an EAP-\n   Message attribute with a length\
    \ of 2 (no data). However, it should be\n   noted that since no User-Name attribute\
    \ is included in the Access-\n   Request, this approach is not compatible with\
    \ RADIUS as specified in\n   [1], nor can it easily be applied in situations where\
    \ proxies are\n   deployed, such as roaming or shared use networks.\n   If the\
    \ RADIUS server supports EAP, it MUST respond with an Access-\n   Challenge packet\
    \ containing an EAP-Message attribute. If the RADIUS\n   server does not support\
    \ EAP, it MUST respond with an Access-Reject.\n   The EAP-Message attribute includes\
    \ an encapsulated EAP packet which\n   is then passed on to the authenticating\
    \ peer.  In the case where the\n   NAS does not initially send an EAP-Request/Identity\
    \ message to the\n   peer, the Access-Challenge typically will contain an EAP-Message\n\
    \   attribute encapsulating an EAP-Request/Identity message, requesting\n   the\
    \ dial-in user to identify themself. The NAS will then respond with\n   a RADIUS\
    \ Access-Request packet containing an EAP-Message attribute\n   encapsulating\
    \ an EAP-Response.  The conversation continues until\n   either a RADIUS Access-Reject\
    \ or Access-Accept packet is received.\n   Reception of a RADIUS Access-Reject\
    \ packet, with or without an EAP-\n   Message attribute encapsulating EAP-Failure,\
    \ MUST result in the NAS\n   issuing an LCP Terminate Request to the authenticating\
    \ peer.  A\n   RADIUS Access-Accept packet with an EAP-Message attribute\n   encapsulating\
    \ EAP-Success successfully ends the authentication phase.\n   The RADIUS Access-Accept/EAP-Message/EAP-Success\
    \ packet MUST contain\n   all of the expected attributes which are currently returned\
    \ in an\n   Access-Accept packet.\n   The above scenario creates a situation in\
    \ which the NAS never needs\n   to manipulate an EAP packet.  An alternative may\
    \ be used in\n   situations where an EAP-Request/Identity message will always\
    \ be sent\n   by the NAS to the authenticating peer.\n   For proxied RADIUS requests\
    \ there are two methods of processing.  If\n   the domain is determined based\
    \ on the Called-Station-Id, the RADIUS\n   Server may proxy the initial RADIUS\
    \ Access-Request/EAP-Start. If the\n   domain is determined based on the user's\
    \ identity, the local RADIUS\n   Server MUST respond with a RADIUS Access-Challenge/EAP-Identity\n\
    \   packet.  The response from the authenticating peer MUST be proxied to\n  \
    \ the final authentication server.\n   For proxied RADIUS requests, the NAS may\
    \ receive an Access-Reject\n   packet in response to its Access-Request/EAP-Identity\
    \ packet.  This\n   would occur if the message was proxied to a RADIUS Server\
    \ which does\n   not support the EAP-Message extension. On receiving an Access-Reject,\n\
    \   the NAS MUST send an LCP Terminate Request to the authenticating\n   peer,\
    \ and disconnect.\n"
- title: 2.3.2.  Retransmission
  contents:
  - "2.3.2.  Retransmission\n   As noted in [3], the EAP authenticator (NAS) is responsible\
    \ for\n   retransmission of packets between the authenticating peer and the\n\
    \   NAS.  Thus if an EAP packet is lost in transit between the\n   authenticating\
    \ peer and the NAS (or vice versa), the NAS will\n   retransmit. As in RADIUS\
    \ [1], the RADIUS client is responsible for\n   retransmission of packets between\
    \ the RADIUS client and the RADIUS\n   server.\n   Note that it may be necessary\
    \ to adjust retransmission strategies and\n   authentication timeouts in certain\
    \ cases. For example, when a token\n   card is used additional time may be required\
    \ to allow the user to\n   find the card and enter the token. Since the NAS will\
    \ typically not\n   have knowledge of the required parameters, these need to be\
    \ provided\n   by the RADIUS server. This can be accomplished by inclusion of\n\
    \   Session-Timeout and Password-Retry attributes within the Access-\n   Challenge\
    \ packet.\n   If Session-Timeout is present in an Access-Challenge packet that\
    \ also\n   contains an EAP-Message, the value of the Session-Timeout provides\n\
    \   the NAS with the maximum number of seconds the NAS should wait for an\n  \
    \ EAP-Response before retransmitting the EAP-Message to the dial-in\n   user.\n"
- title: 2.3.3.  Fragmentation
  contents:
  - "2.3.3.  Fragmentation\n   Using the EAP-Message attribute, it is possible for\
    \ the RADIUS server\n   to encapsulate an EAP packet that is larger than the MTU\
    \ on the link\n   between the NAS and the peer. Since it is not possible for the\
    \ RADIUS\n   server to use MTU discovery to ascertain the link MTU, the Framed-MTU\n\
    \   attribute may be included in an Access-Request packet containing an\n   EAP-Message\
    \ attribute so as to provide the RADIUS server with this\n   information.\n"
- title: 2.3.4.  Examples
  contents:
  - "2.3.4.  Examples\n   The example below shows the conversation between the authenticating\n\
    \   peer, NAS, and RADIUS server, for the case of a One Time Password\n   (OTP)\
    \ authentication. OTP is used only for illustrative purposes;\n   other authentication\
    \ protocols could also have been used, although\n   they might show somewhat different\
    \ behavior.\n"

  - "2.3.5.  Alternative uses\n   Currently the conversation between the backend security\
    \ server and\n   the RADIUS server is proprietary because of lack of standardization.\n\
    \   In order to increase standardization and provide interoperability\n   between\
    \ Radius vendors and backend security vendors, it is\n   recommended that RADIUS-encapsulated\
    \ EAP be used for this\n   conversation.\n   This has the advantage of allowing\
    \ the RADIUS server to support EAP\n   without the need for authentication-specific\
    \  code within the RADIUS\n   server. Authentication-specific code can then reside\
    \ on a backend\n   security server instead.\n   In the case where RADIUS-encapsulated\
    \ EAP is used in a conversation\n   between a RADIUS server and a backend security\
    \ server, the security\n   server will typically return an Access-Accept/EAP-Success\
    \ message\n   without inclusion of the expected attributes currently returned\
    \ in an\n   Access-Accept. This means that the RADIUS server MUST add these\n\

    \    an HMAC-MD5 [9] checksum of the entire Access-Request packet,\n      including\
    \ Type, ID, Length and authenticator, using the shared\n      secret as the key,\

- title: 7.2.1.  Separation of EAP server and PPP authenticator
  contents:
  - "7.2.1.  Separation of EAP server and PPP authenticator\n   It is possible for\
    \ the EAP endpoints to mutually authenticate,\n   negotiate a ciphersuite, and\
    \ derive a session key for subsequent use\n   in PPP encryption.\n   This does\
    \ not present an issue on the peer, since the peer and EAP\n   client reside on\
    \ the same machine; all that is required is for the\n   EAP client module to pass\
    \ the session key to the PPP encryption\n   module.\n   The situation is more\
    \ complex when EAP is used with RADIUS, since the\n   PPP authenticator will typically\
    \ not reside on the same machine as\n   the EAP server. For example, the EAP server\
    \ may be a backend security\n   server, or a module residing on the RADIUS server.\n\
    \   In the case where the EAP server and PPP authenticator reside on\n   different\
    \ machines, there are several implications for security.\n   Firstly, mutual authentication\
    \ will occur between the peer and the\n   EAP server, not between the peer and\
    \ the authenticator. This means\n   that it is not possible for the peer to validate\
    \ the identity of the\n   NAS or tunnel server that it is speaking to.\n   As\
    \ described earlier, when EAP/RADIUS is used to encapsulate EAP\n   packets, the\
    \ Message-Authenticator attribute is required in\n   EAP/RADIUS Access-Requests\
    \ sent from the NAS or tunnel server to the\n   RADIUS server. Since the Message-Authenticator\
    \ attribute involves a\n   HMAC-MD5 hash, it is possible for the RADIUS server\
    \ to verify the\n   integrity of the Access-Request as well as the NAS or tunnel\
    \ server's\n   identity.  Similarly, Access-Challenge packets sent from the RADIUS\n\
    \   server to the NAS are also authenticated and integrity protected\n   using\
    \ an HMAC-MD5 hash, enabling the NAS or tunnel server to\n   determine the integrity\
    \ of the packet and verify the identity of the\n   RADIUS server.  Moreover, EAP\
    \ packets sent via methods that contain\n   their own integrity protection cannot\
    \ be successfully modified by a\n   rogue NAS or tunnel server.\n   The second\
    \ issue that arises in the case of an EAP server and PPP\n   authenticator residing\
    \ on different machines is that the session key\n   negotiated between the peer\
    \ and EAP server will need to be\n   transmitted to the authenticator.  Therefore\
    \ a mechanism needs to be\n   provided to transmit the session key from the EAP\
    \ server to the\n   authenticator or tunnel server that needs to use the key.\
    \ The\n   specification of this transit mechanism is outside the scope of this\n\
    \   document.\n"
- title: 7.2.2.  Connection hijacking
  contents:
  - "7.2.2.  Connection hijacking\n   In this form of attack, the attacker attempts\
    \ to inject packets into\n   the conversation between the NAS and the RADIUS server,\
    \ or between\n   the RADIUS server and the backend security server. RADIUS does\
    \ not\n   support encryption, and as described in [1], only Access-Reply and\n\
    \   Access-Challenge packets are integrity protected. Moreover, the\n   integrity\
    \ protection mechanism described in [1] is weaker than that\n   likely to be used\
    \ by some EAP methods, making it possible to subvert\n   those methods by attacking\
    \ EAP/RADIUS.\n   In order to provide for authentication of all packets in the\
    \ EAP\n   exchange, all EAP/RADIUS packets MUST be authenticated using the\n \
    \  Message-Authenticator attribute, as described previously.\n"
- title: 7.2.3.  Man in the middle attacks
  contents:
  - "7.2.3.  Man in the middle attacks\n   Since RADIUS security is based on shared\
    \ secrets, end-to-end security\n   is not provided in the case where authentication\
    \ or accounting\n   packets are forwarded along a proxy chain.  As a result, attackers\n\
    \   gaining control of a RADIUS proxy will be able to modify EAP packets\n   in\
    \ transit.\n"
- title: 7.2.4.  Multiple databases
  contents:
  - "7.2.4.  Multiple databases\n   In many cases a backend security server will be\
    \ deployed along with a\n   RADIUS server in order to provide EAP services. Unless\
    \ the backend\n   security server also functions as a RADIUS server, two separate\
    \ user\n   databases will exist, each containing information about the security\n\
    \   requirements for the user. This represents a weakness, since security\n  \
    \ may be compromised by a successful attack on either of the servers,\n   or their\
    \ backend databases. With multiple user databases, adding a\n   new user may require\
    \ multiple operations, increasing the chances for\n   error.  The problems are\
    \ further magnified in the case where user\n   information is also being kept\
    \ in an LDAP server. In this case, three\n   stores of user information may exist.\n\
    \   In order to address these threats, consolidation of databases is\n   recommended.\
    \  This can be achieved by having both the RADIUS server\n   and backend security\
    \ server store information in the same backend\n   database; by having the backend\
    \ security server provide a full RADIUS\n   implementation; or by consolidating\
    \ both the backend security server\n   and the RADIUS server onto the same machine.\n"
- title: 7.2.5.  Negotiation attacks
  contents:
  - "7.2.5.  Negotiation attacks\n   In a negotiation attack, a rogue NAS, tunnel\
    \ server, RADIUS proxy or\n   RADIUS server causes the authenticating peer to\
    \ choose a less secure\n   authentication method so as to make it easier to obtain\
    \ the user's\n   password. For example, a session that would normally be authenticated\n\
    \   with EAP would instead authenticated via CHAP or PAP; alternatively,\n   a\
    \ connection that would normally be authenticated via one EAP type\n   occurs\
    \ via a less secure EAP type, such as MD5. The threat posed by\n   rogue devices,\
    \ once thought to be remote, has gained currency given\n   compromises of telephone\
    \ company switching systems, such as those\n   described in [11].\n   Protection\
    \ against negotiation attacks requires the elimination of\n   downward negotiations.\
    \ This can be achieved via implementation of\n   per-connection policy on the\
    \ part of the authenticating peer, and\n   per-user policy on the part of the\
    \ RADIUS server.\n   For the authenticating peer, authentication policy should\
    \ be set on a\n   per-connection basis. Per-connection policy allows an authenticating\n\
    \   peer to negotiate EAP when calling one service, while negotiating\n   CHAP\
    \ for another service, even if both services are accessible via\n   the same phone\
    \ number.\n   With per-connection policy, an authenticating peer will only attempt\n\
    \   to negotiate EAP for a session in which EAP support is expected. As a\n  \
    \ result, there is a presumption that an authenticating peer selecting\n   EAP\
    \ requires that level of security. If it cannot be provided, it is\n   likely\
    \ that there is some kind of misconfiguration, or even that the\n   authenticating\
    \ peer is contacting the wrong server. Should the NAS\n   not be able to negotiate\
    \ EAP, or should the EAP-Request sent by the\n   NAS be of a different EAP type\
    \ than what is expected, the\n   authenticating peer MUST disconnect. An authenticating\
    \ peer expecting\n   EAP to be negotiated for a session MUST NOT negotiate CHAP\
    \ or PAP.\n   For a NAS, it may not be possible to determine whether a user is\n\
    \   required to authenticate with EAP until the user's identity is known.\n  \
    \ For example, for shared-uses NASes it is possible for one reseller to\n   implement\
    \ EAP while another does not. In such cases, if any users of\n   the NAS MUST\
    \ do EAP, then the NAS MUST attempt to negotiate EAP for\n   every call. This\
    \ avoids forcing an EAP-capable client to do more than\n   one authentication,\
    \ which weakens security.\n   If CHAP is negotiated, the NAS will pass the User-Name\
    \ and CHAP-\n   Password attributes to the RADIUS Server in an Access-Request\
    \ packet.\n   If the user is not required to use EAP, then the RADIUS Server will\n\
    \   respond with an Access-Accept or Access-Reject packet as appropriate.\n  \
    \ However, if CHAP has been negotiated but EAP is required, the RADIUS\n   server\
    \ MUST respond with an Access-Reject, rather than an Access-\n   Challenge/EAP-Message/EAP-Request\
    \ packet.  The authenticating peer\n   MUST refuse to renegotiate authentication,\
    \ even if the renegotiation\n   is from CHAP to EAP.\n   If EAP is negotiated\
    \ but is not supported by the RADIUS proxy or\n   server, then the server or proxy\
    \ MUST respond with an Access-Reject.\n   In these cases, the NAS MUST send an\
    \ LCP-Terminate and disconnect the\n   user.  This is the correct behavior since\
    \ the authenticating peer is\n   expecting EAP to be negotiated, and that expectation\
    \ cannot be\n   fulfilled. An EAP-capable authenticating peer MUST refuse to\n\
    \   renegotiate the authentication protocol if EAP had initially been\n   negotiated.\
    \  Note that problems with a non-EAP capable RADIUS proxy\n   could prove difficult\
    \ to diagnose, since a user dialing in from one\n   location (with an EAP-capable\
    \ proxy) might be able to successfully\n   authenticate via EAP, while the same\
    \ user dialing into another\n   location (and encountering an EAP-incapable proxy)\
    \ might be\n   consistently disconnected.\n"
