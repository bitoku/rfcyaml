  - "1.  Introduction\n   \"Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE): A Protocol
    for Network\n   Address Translator (NAT) Traversal for Offer/Answer Protocols\"\n
    \  [RFC5245] defines a concept of ICE options.  However, the ICE RFC\n   fails
    to create an IANA registry for ICE options.  As one ICE option\n   is under specification
    in [ECN-FOR-RTP], there is now a need to\n   create the registry.\n   RFC 5245
    says: \"ICE provides for extensibility by allowing an offer\n   or answer to contain
    a series of tokens that identify the ICE\n   extensions used by that agent.  If
    an agent supports an ICE\n   extension, it MUST include the token defined for
    that extension in\n   the ice-options attribute\".\n   Thus, as future extensions
    are defined, these ICE options need to be\n   registered with IANA to ensure non-conflicting
    identification.  The\n   ICE option identifiers are used in signalling between
    the ICE\n   endpoints to negotiate extension support.  RFC 5245 defines one\n
    \  method of signalling these ICE options, using the Session Description\n   Protocol
    (SDP) with Offer/Answer [RFC3264].\n   This document updates the ICE specification
    [RFC5245] to define the\n   \"Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE) Options\"
    registry.\n"

    \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\",
    and \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC
    2119 [RFC2119].\n"
  title: 2.  Requirements Language
- contents:
  - "3.  IANA Considerations\n   This document defines a registry \"Interactive Connectivity\n
    \  Establishment (ICE) Options\" for ICE options that can be used in the\n   SDP
    \"ice-options\" attribute or other signalling parameters carrying\n   the ICE
    options.\n"

    - "3.1.  ICE Options\n   An ICE option identifier MUST fulfill the ABNF [RFC5234]
      syntax for\n   \"ice-option-tag\" as specified in [RFC5245].  This syntax is\n
      \  reproduced here for simplicity, but the authoritative definition is\n   in
      the ICE RFC:\n   ice-option-tag        = 1*ice-char\n   ice-char              =
      ALPHA / DIGIT / \"+\" / \"/\"\n   ICE options are of unlimited length according
      to the syntax; however,\n   they are RECOMMENDED to be no longer than 20 characters.
      \ This is to\n   reduce message sizes and allow for efficient parsing.\n   Registration
      of an ICE option in the \"Interactive Connectivity\n   Establishment (ICE) Options\"
      registry is done using the Specification\n   Required policy as defined in \"Guidelines
      for Writing an IANA\n   Considerations Section in RFCs\" [RFC5226].\n   A registration
      request MUST include the following information:\n   o  The ICE option identifier
      to be registered\n   o  Name, Email, and Address of a contact person for the
      registration\n   o  Organization or individuals having the change control\n
      \  o  Short description of the ICE extension to which the option relates\n   o
      \ Reference(s) to the specification defining the ICE option and the\n      related
      extensions\n   This document registers no ICE option.\n"
