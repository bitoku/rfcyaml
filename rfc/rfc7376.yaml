  - "1.  Introduction\n   Traversal Using Relays around NAT (TURN) [RFC5766] is a\
    \ protocol that\n   is often used to improve the connectivity of Peer-to-Peer\
    \ (P2P)\n   applications (as defined in Section 2.7 of [RFC5128]).  TURN allows\
    \ a\n   connection to be established when one or both sides are incapable of\n\
    \   a direct P2P connection.  The TURN server is also a building block to\n  \
    \ support interactive, real-time communication using audio, video,\n   collaboration,\
    \ games, etc., between two peer web browsers using the\n   Web Real-Time Communication\
    \ (WebRTC) [WebRTC-Overview] framework.\n   A TURN server is also used in the\
    \ following scenarios:\n   o  For privacy, users of WebRTC-based web applications\
    \ may use a TURN\n      server to hide host candidate addresses from the remote\
    \ peer.\n   o  Enterprise networks deploy firewalls that typically block UDP\n\
    \      traffic.  When SIP user agents or WebRTC endpoints are deployed\n     \
    \ behind such firewalls, media cannot be sent over UDP across the\n      firewall\
    \ but must instead be sent using TCP (which causes a\n      different user experience).\
    \  In such cases, a TURN server deployed\n      in the DeMilitarized Zone (DMZ)\
    \ might be used to traverse\n      firewalls.\n   o  The use case explained in\
    \ Section 3.3.5 of [WebRTC-Use-Cases]\n      (\"Simple Video Communication Service,\
    \ enterprise aspects\") refers\n      to deploying a TURN server in the DMZ to\
    \ audit all media sessions\n      from inside an Enterprise premises to any external\
    \ peer.\n   o  A TURN server could also be deployed for RTP Mobility\n      [TURN-Mobility],\
    \ etc.\n   o  A TURN server may be used for IPv4-to-IPv6, IPv6-to-IPv6, and\n\
    \      IPv6-to-IPv4 relaying [RFC6156].\n   o  Interactive Connectivity Establishment\
    \ (ICE) [RFC5245]\n      connectivity checks using server reflexive candidates\
    \ could fail\n      when the endpoint is behind a NAT [RFC3235] that performs\
    \ address-\n      dependent mapping as described in Section 4.1 of [RFC4787].\
    \  In\n      such cases, a relayed candidate allocated from the TURN server is\n\
    \      used for media.\n   Session Traversal Utilities for NAT (STUN) [RFC5389]\
    \ specifies an\n   authentication mechanism called the long-term credential mechanism.\n\
    \   Section 4 of TURN [RFC5766] specifies that TURN servers and clients\n   must\
    \ implement this mechanism; Section 4 of TURN [RFC5766] also\n   specifies that\
    \ the TURN server must demand that all requests from the\n   client be authenticated\
    \ using this mechanism or that an equally\n   strong or stronger mechanism for\
    \ client authentication be used.\n   In the above scenarios, applications would\
    \ use the ICE protocol for\n   gathering candidates.  An ICE agent can use TURN\
    \ to learn server\n   reflexive and relayed candidates.  If the TURN server requires\
    \ that\n   the TURN request be authenticated, then the ICE agent will use the\n\
    \   long-term credential mechanism explained in Section 10 of [RFC5389]\n   for\
    \ authentication and message integrity.  Section 10 of the TURN\n   specification\
    \ [RFC5766] explains the importance of the long-term\n   credential mechanism\
    \ to mitigate various attacks.  Client\n   authentication is essential to prevent\
    \ unauthorized users from\n   accessing the TURN server, and misuse of credentials\
    \ could impose\n   significant cost on the victim TURN server.\n   This document\
    \ focuses on listing security problems and practical\n   problems with current\
    \ STUN authentication for TURN so that it can\n   serve as the basis for stronger\
    \ authentication mechanisms.\n   An Allocate request is more likely than a Binding\
    \ request to be\n   identified by a server administrator as needing client authentication\n\
    \   and integrity protection of messages exchanged.  Hence, the issues\n   discussed\
    \ here regarding STUN authentication are applicable mainly in\n   the context\
    \ of TURN messages.\n"

  contents:
  - "4.  Problems with STUN Long-Term Authentication for TURN\n   1.  As described\
    \ in [RFC5389], the long-term credential mechanism\n       could provide to users\
    \ a long-term credential in the form of a\n       traditional \"log-in\" username\
    \ and password; this credential would\n       not change for extended periods\
    \ of time.  The key derived from\n       the user credentials would be used to\
    \ provide message integrity\n       for every TURN request/response.  However,\
    \ an attacker that is\n       capable of eavesdropping on a message exchange between\
    \ a client\n       and server can determine the password by trying a number of\n\
    \       candidate passwords and checking to see if one of them is correct\n  \
    \     by calculating the message integrity using these candidate\n       passwords\
    \ and comparing them with the message integrity value in\n       the MESSAGE-INTEGRITY\
    \ attribute.\n   2.  When a TURN server is deployed in the DMZ and requires that\n\
    \       requests be authenticated using the long-term credential\n       mechanism\
    \ as described in [RFC5389], the TURN server needs to be\n       aware of the\
    \ username and password to validate the message\n       integrity of the requests\
    \ and to provide message integrity for\n       responses.  This results in management\
    \ overhead on the TURN\n       server.  Long-term credentials (username, realm,\
    \ and password)\n       need to be stored on the server side, using an MD5 hash\
    \ over the\n       credentials, which is not considered best current practice.\n\
    \       [RFC6151] discusses security vulnerabilities of MD5 and\n       encourages\
    \ implementers not to use it.  It is not possible to use\n       STUN long-term\
    \ credentials in implementations that are compliant\n       with US FIPS 140-2\
    \ [FIPS-140-2], since MD5 isn't an approved\n       algorithm.\n   3.  The long-term\
    \ credential mechanism discussed in [RFC5389]\n       specifies that the TURN\
    \ client must include a username value in\n       the USERNAME STUN attribute.\
    \  An adversary snooping the TURN\n       messages between the TURN client and\
    \ server can identify the\n       users involved in the call, resulting in privacy\
    \ leakage.  If\n       TURN usernames are linked to real usernames, then privacy\
    \ leakage\n       will result, but in certain scenarios TURN usernames need not\
    \ be\n       linked to any real usernames given to users, as the usernames are\n\
    \       just provisioned on a per-company basis.\n   4.  STUN authentication relies\
    \ on HMAC-SHA1 [RFC2104].  There is no\n       mechanism for hash agility in the\
    \ protocol itself, although\n       Section 16.3 of [RFC5389] does discuss a plan\
    \ for migrating to a\n       more secure algorithm in case HMAC-SHA1 is found\
    \ to be\n       compromised.\n   5.  A man-in-the middle attacker posing as a\
    \ TURN server challenges\n       the client to authenticate, learns the USERNAME\
    \ of the client,\n       and later snoops the traffic from the client, thereby\
    \ identifying\n       user activity; this results in privacy leakage.\n   6. \
    \ Hosting multiple realms on a single IP address is challenging\n       with TURN.\
    \  When a TURN server needs to send the REALM attribute\n       in response to\
    \ an unauthenticated request, it has no useful\n       information for determining\
    \ which realm it should send in the\n       response, except the source transport\
    \ address of the TURN\n       request.  Note that this is a problem with multi-tenant\
    \ scenarios\n       only; this may not be a problem when the TURN server is located\n\
    \       in enterprise premises.\n   7.  In WebRTC, the JavaScript code needs to\
    \ know the username and\n       password to use in the W3C RTCPeerConnection API\
    \ to access the\n       TURN server.  This exposes user credentials to the JavaScript\n\
    \       code, which could be malicious; the malicious JavaScript code\n      \
    \ could then misuse or leak the credentials.  If the credentials\n       happen\
    \ to be used for accessing services other than TURN, then\n       the security\
    \ implications are much larger.\n"
