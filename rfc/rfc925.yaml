  - "STATUS OF THIS MEMO\n   This memo is prompted by RFC-917 by Jeffery Mogul on\
    \ \"Internet\n   Subnets\".   In that memo, Mogul makes a case for the use of\
    \ \"explicit\n   subnets\" in a multi-LAN environment.  In this memo, I attempt\
    \ to make\n   a case for \"transparent subnets\".  This RFC suggests a proposed\n\
    \   protocol for the ARPA-Internet community, and requests discussion and\n  \
    \ suggestions for improvements.  Distribution of this memo is\n   unlimited.\n"
- title: INTRODUCTION
  contents:
  - "INTRODUCTION\n   The problem of treating a set of local area networks (LANs)\
    \ as one\n   Internet network has generated some interest and concern.  It is\n\
    \   inappropriate to give each LAN within an site a distinct Internet\n   network\
    \ number.  It is desirable to hide the details of the\n   interconnections between\
    \ the LANs within an site from people,\n   gateways, and hosts outside the site.\
    \  The question arises on how to\n   best do this, and even how to do it at all.\
    \  One proposal is to use\n   \"explicit subnets\" [1].  The explicit subnet scheme\
    \ is a call to\n   recursively apply the mechanisms the Internet uses to manage\
    \ networks\n   to the problem of managing LANs within one network.  In this note\
    \ I\n   urge another approach: the use of \"transparent subnets\" supported by\n\
    \   a multi-LAN extension of the Address Resolution Protocol [2].\n"
- title: OVERVIEW
  contents:
  - "OVERVIEW\n   To quickly review the Address Resolution Protocol (ARP).  Each host\n\
    \   on a broadcast LAN knows both its own physical hardware address (HA)\n   on\
    \ the LAN and its own Internet Address (IA).  When Host-A is given\n   the IA\
    \ of Host-B and told to send a datagram to it, Host-A must find\n   the HA that\
    \ corresponds to Host-B's IA.  To do this Host-A forms an\n   ARP packet that\
    \ contains its own HA and IA and the IA of the\n   destination host (Host-B).\
    \  Host-A broadcasts this ARP packet.  The\n   hosts that receive this ARP packet\
    \ check to see if they are\n   destination sought.  If so, they (it should be\
    \ only Host-B) send a\n   reply specifically addressed to the originator of the\
    \ query (Host-A)\n   and supplying the HA that was needed.  The Host-A now has\
    \ both the HA\n   and the IA of the destination (Host-B).  The Host-A adds this\n\
    \   information to a local cache for future use.\n      Note:  The ARP is actually\
    \ more general purpose than this brief\n      sketch indicates.\n"

  - "Multi-LAN Address Resolution\n   The idea in this memo is to extend the ARP to\
    \ work in an environment\n   of multiple interconnected LANs.\n   To see how this\
    \ could work let us imagine a \"magic box\" (BOX) that is\n   connected as if\
    \ it were an ordinary host to two (or more) LANs.\n   Hosts continue to behave\
    \ exactly as they do with the basic ARP.\n   When an ARP query is broadcast by\
    \ any host the BOX reads it (as do\n   all the hosts on that LAN).  In addition\
    \ to checking whether it is\n   the host sought (and replying if it is), the BOX\
    \ checks its cache of\n   IA:HA address mappings in the cache that it keeps for\
    \ each LAN it is\n   attached to.\n      Case 1: If the mapping for the host is\
    \ found in the cache for the\n      LAN that the query came from, the BOX does\
    \ not respond (letting\n      the sought host respond for itself).\n      Case\
    \ 2: If the mapping for the host is found in the cache for a\n      different\
    \ LAN than the query came from, the BOX sends a reply\n      giving its own HA\
    \ on the LAN the query came from.  The BOX acts as\n      an agent for the destination\
    \ host.\n      Case 3: If the mapping is not found in any of the caches then,\
    \ the\n      BOX must try to find out the the address, and then respond as in\n\
    \      case 1 or 2.\n      In case 3, the BOX has to do some magic.\n        \
    \ The BOX keeps a search list of sought hosts.  Each entry\n         includes\
    \ the IA of the host sought, the interface the ARP was\n         received on,\
    \ and the source addresses of the original request.\n         When case 3 occurs,\
    \ the search list is checked.  If the sought\n         host is already listed\
    \ the search is terminated, if not the\n         search is propagated.\n     \
    \    To propagate the search, an entry is first made on the search\n         list,\
    \ then the BOX composes and sends an ARP packet on each of\n         its interfaces\
    \ except the interface the instigating ARP packet\n         was received on. \
    \ If a reply is received, the information is\n         entered into the appropriate\
    \ cache, the entry is deleted from\n         the search list and a response to\
    \ the search instigating ARP is\n         made as in case 1 or 2.  If no reply\
    \ is received, give up and\n         do nothing -- no response is sent to the\
    \ instigating host (the\n         entry stays on the search list).\n"

  - "THE MULTI-LAN ADDRESS RESOLUTION PROTOCOL\n   The plan is to use ARP just as\
    \ it is.  The new element is the \"magic\n   box\" (\"ARP-based bridge\") that\
    \ relays the ARP request into\n   neighboring LANs and acts as an agent for relaying\
    \ datagrams to hosts\n   on other LANs.\n   The Details\n      Hosts continue\
    \ to behave exactly as they do with the basic ARP.\n      The LANs are connected\
    \ together by BOXes (computers that are\n      attached to two or more LANs exactly\
    \ as hosts are attached to\n      LANs).  The BOXes implement the following procedure.\n\
    \      Each BOX keeps a table for each LAN it is connected to (or for\n      each\
    \ LAN interface).  Entries in these tables time out, so these\n      tables are\
    \ caches of recent information.  The entries in these\n      caches are the IA:HA\
    \ address pairs for that LAN.\n      When an ARP query is broadcast by any host\
    \ the BOX reads it (as do\n      all the hosts on that LAN).  In addition to checking\
    \ to see if it\n      is the host sought (and replying if it is), the BOX checks\
    \ its\n      cache of IA:HA address mappings in the table it keeps for each LAN\n\
    \      it is attached to.\n         Case 1: If the mapping for the host is found\
    \ in the cache for\n         the LAN that the query came from, the BOX does not\
    \ respond\n         (letting the sought host respond for itself).  The time out\
    \ on\n         this entry is not reinitialized.\n         Case 2: If the mapping\
    \ for the host is found in the cache for a\n         different LAN than the query\
    \ came from, the BOX sends a reply\n         giving its own HA on the LAN the\
    \ query came from.  The time out\n         on this entry is not reinitialized.\n\

  - "Multi-LAN Address Resolution\n      The search list must be kept and the termination\
    \ rule followed to\n      avoid an infinite relaying of an ARP request for a host\
    \ that does\n      not respond.  Once a host is listed in the search list, ARP\n\
    \      requests will not be relayed.  If a host that is down (or\n      otherwise\
    \ not responding to ARP requests), comes up (or otherwise\n      begins responding\
    \ to ARP requests) it will still not become\n      available to hosts in other\
    \ LANs until the search list entry times\n      out.\n         There are two approaches\
    \ to this problem: first, to have a\n         relatively short time out on the\
    \ search list entries; or\n         second, to have the BOX periodically send\
    \ ARPs for each entry\n         on the search list.\n      There are several time\
    \ outs involved in this scheme.\n         First, the hosts try to get the address\
    \ resolved using ARP.\n         They may actually make several attempts before\
    \ giving up if a\n         host is not responding.  One must have an good estimate\
    \ of the\n         length of time that a host may keep trying.  Call this time\
    \ T1.\n         Second, there is the time that an entry stays on the search\n\
    \         list, or the time between BOX generated ARPs to resolve these\n    \
    \     addresses.  Call this time T2.\n            Note that this time (T2) must\
    \ be greater than the sum of the\n            T1s for the longest loop of LANs.\n\
    \         Third, there is the time that entries stay in the cache for\n      \
    \   each LAN.  Call this time T3.\n         The relationship must be  T1 < T2\
    \ < T3.\n            One suggestion is that T1 be less than one minute, T2 be\
    \ ten\n            minutes, and T3 be one hour.\n         If the environment is\
    \ very stable, making T3 longer will result\n         in fewer searches (less\
    \ overhead in ARP traffic).  If the\n         environment is very dynamic making\
    \ T3 shorter will result in\n         more rapid adaptation to the changes.\n\
    \         Another possibility is to restart the timer on the cache\n         entries\
    \ each time they are referenced, and have a small value\n         for T3.  This\
    \ would result in entries that are frequently used\n         staying in the cache,\
    \ but infrequently used information being\n         discarded quickly.  Unfortunately\
    \ there is no necessary\n         relationship between frequency of use and correctness.\

- title: DISCUSSION
  contents:
  - "DISCUSSION\n   The claim for the extended ARP scheme is that the average host\
    \ need\n   not even know it is in a multi-LAN environment.\n      If a host took\
    \ the trouble to analyze its local cache of IA:AH\n      address mappings it might\
    \ discover that several of the IAs mapped\n      to the same HA.  And if it took\
    \ timing measurements it might\n      discover that some hosts responded with\
    \ less delay that others.\n      And further, it might be able to find a correlation\
    \ between these\n      discoveries.  But few hosts would take the trouble.\n \
    \  Address Structure\n      In the explicit subnet scheme, some IA bits are devoted\
    \ to\n      identifying the subnet (i.e., the LAN).  The address is broken up\n\
    \      into network, subnet, and host fields.  Generally, when fields are\n  \
    \    use the density of the assigned addresses in the address space\n      goes\
    \ down.  That is, there is a less efficient use of the address\n      space. \
    \ Significant implementation problems may arise if more\n      subnets than planned\
    \ are installed and it becomes necessary to\n      change the size of the subnet\
    \ field.  It seems totally impractical\n      to use the explicit subnet scheme\
    \ with a class C IA.\n      In the extended ARP scheme the address is simply the\
    \ network, and\n      host fields.  The extended ARP scheme may be used with any\
    \ class\n      of IA.\n   Relocating Hosts\n      In the explicit subnet scheme\
    \ when a host is unplugged from one\n      LAN and plugged into another its IA\
    \ must change.\n      In the extended ARP scheme it may keep the same IA.\n"

  - "Multi-LAN Address Resolution\n   One view of the situation suggests that there\
    \ are really two\n   problems:\n      1. How does the host discover if the destination\
    \ is in this LAN or\n      some other LAN?\n         This question assumes that\
    \ a host should know the difference\n         and should do something different\
    \ in the two cases, and further\n         that once the host knows the answer\
    \ it also know how to send\n         the data (e.g., directly to the host, or\
    \ to the box).\n            The claim here is that the hosts should not know the\n\
    \            difference and should always do the same thing.\n      2. How do\
    \ the BOXes that connect LANs know which BOXes are the\n      routes to which\
    \ LANs?\n         This question assumes that the BOXes need some kind of\n   \
    \      topological knowledge, and exchange BOX-to-BOX protocol\n         information\
    \ about connectivity.\n            The claim here is that the BOXes do not need\
    \ topological\n            knowledge and do not need to explicitly know about\
    \ the\n            existence of other BOXes.\n   It has been suggested that there\
    \ are two problems: first, how the\n   hosts do routing; and second, how the BOXes\
    \ do routing.  A claim has\n   been made that the competing strategies each have\
    \ an approach to each\n   problems and one could select a solution made up partly\
    \ from one\n   approach and partly from another.\n      For example: use ARP within\
    \ the LAN and have the BOX send ARP\n      replies and act as a agent (as in the\
    \ extended ARP scheme), but\n      use a BOX-to-BOX protocol to get the \"which\
    \ hosts are where\"\n      information into the BOXes (as in the explicit subnet\
    \ scheme).\n   There are two places where code is involved: a large number of\
    \ hosts,\n   and a small number of BOXes.  In considering the trade off between\n\
    \   explicit subnet scheme and extended ARP scheme, the work done in the\n   hosts\
    \ should weigh a lot more than the work done in the BOXes.\n      What do hosts\
    \ do?\n         Explicit Subnet Scheme\n            The host must be able to decide\

- title: SUMMARY
  contents:
  - "SUMMARY\n   It would be useful if the Internet community could come to some\n\
    \   agreement on a solution to the multi-LAN network problem and could\n   with\
    \ a unified voice urge work station manufacturers to provide that\n   solution\
    \ built in.\n   I urge consideration of the extended ARP scheme expounded on here.\n\
    \   I think that most work stations will be connected to LANs that have a\n  \
    \ broadcast capability.  I think that most work stations will be used\n   in situations\
    \ that do not require explicit subnets, and most will be\n   used in situations\
    \ where a class C Internet addresses would be\n   appropriate (and explicit subnets\
    \ impossible).  Thus, i think it\n   would be best to ask manufacturers to include\
    \ support for ARP in work\n   stations off the shelf.  I also think we ought to\
    \ get busy and\n   create, develop, test, and produce the magic boxes I suggest\
    \ so that\n   they too are available off the shelf.\n   Please note that neither\
    \ this note nor [1] proposes a specific\n   routing procedure or BOX-to-BOX protocol.\
    \  This is because such a\n   routing procedure is a very hard problem.  The plan\
    \ proposed here\n   will let us get started on using multi-LAN environments in\
    \ a\n   reasonable way.  If we later decide on a routing procedure to be used\n\
    \   between the BOXes we can redo the BOXes without having to redo the\n   hosts.\n"
