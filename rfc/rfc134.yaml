    \ 02139\nNIC 6711\n     The ground rules for attendance and topics for discussion\
    \ are as\noutlined in RFC #87.  Basically, each organization represented is\n\
    expected to participate by presenting one or more working papers in\none or more\
    \ of the areas chosen for discussion.  A minimal working\npaper is defined to\
    \ consist of a set of written notes and an oral\npresentation.  We suggest that\
    \ the RFC mechanism be used to\ndisseminate the written working notes.  I am asking\
    \ that all attendees\nmake reservations no later than June 1st and that all RFC's\
    \ and\nworking notes which are pertinent to this meeting be in my hand no\nlater\
    \ than Tuesday, June 22nd.  We will publish by June 25th a\nbibliography of reading\
    \ material pertinent to this graphic meeting and\na list of prospective attendees.\
    \  Authors of working notes not\ndisseminated through the RFC mechanism are responsible\
    \ for mailing to\neach attendee a copy of his working notes no later than July\
    \ 1, 1971.\n     Each attendee making a presentation can expect a telephone call\n\
    from me about July 5 to find how much time he wants for his\npresentation.  The\
    \ times will be scaled appropriately to fit the\nschedule.\n       [ This RFC\
    \ was put into machine readable form for entry ]\n        [ into the online RFC\
    \ archives by Stephane Alnet 4/97 ]\n"
