  - "Abstract\n   This document specifies protocol enhancements that allow transparent\n\
    \   routing of IP datagrams to mobile nodes in the Internet.  Each mobile\n  \
    \ node is always identified by its home address, regardless of its\n   current\
    \ point of attachment to the Internet.  While situated away\n   from its home,\
    \ a mobile node is also associated with a care-of\n   address, which provides\
    \ information about its current point of\n   attachment to the Internet.  The\
    \ protocol provides for registering\n   the care-of address with a home agent.\
    \  The home agent sends\n   datagrams destined for the mobile node through a tunnel\
    \ to the care-\n   of address.  After arriving at the end of the tunnel, each\
    \ datagram\n   is then delivered to the mobile node.\n"

- title: 1. Introduction
  contents:
  - "1. Introduction\n   IP version 4 assumes that a node's IP address uniquely identifies\
    \ the\n   node's point of attachment to the Internet.  Therefore, a node must\n\
    \   be located on the network indicated by its IP address in order to\n   receive\
    \ datagrams destined to it; otherwise, datagrams destined to\n   the node would\
    \ be undeliverable.  For a node to change its point of\n   attachment without\
    \ losing its ability to communicate, currently one\n   of the two following mechanisms\
    \ must typically be employed:\n      a) the node must change its IP address whenever\
    \ it changes its\n         point of attachment, or\n      b) host-specific routes\
    \ must be propagated throughout much of the\n         Internet routing fabric.\n\
    \   Both of these alternatives are often unacceptable.  The first makes\n   it\
    \ impossible for a node to maintain transport and higher-layer\n   connections\
    \ when the node changes location.  The second has obvious\n   and severe scaling\
    \ problems, especially relevant considering the\n   explosive growth in sales\
    \ of notebook (mobile) computers.\n   A new, scalable, mechanism is required for\
    \ accommodating node\n   mobility within the Internet.  This document defines\
    \ such a\n   mechanism, which enables nodes to change their point of attachment\
    \ to\n   the Internet without changing their IP address.\n   Changes between this\
    \ revised specification for Mobile IP and the\n   original specifications (see\
    \ [33, 32, 34, 43, 8]) are detailed in the\n   appendix section G.\n"
- title: 1.1. Protocol Requirements
  contents:
  - "1.1. Protocol Requirements\n   A mobile node must be able to communicate with\
    \ other nodes after\n   changing its link-layer point of attachment to the Internet,\
    \ yet\n   without changing its IP address.\n   A mobile node must be able to communicate\
    \ with other nodes that do\n   not implement these mobility functions.  No protocol\
    \ enhancements are\n   required in hosts or routers that are not acting as any\
    \ of the new\n   architectural entities introduced in Section 1.5.\n   All messages\
    \ used to update another node as to the location of a\n   mobile node must be\
    \ authenticated in order to protect against remote\n   redirection attacks.\n"
- title: 1.2. Goals
  contents:
  - "1.2. Goals\n   The link by which a mobile node is directly attached to the Internet\n\
    \   may often be a wireless link.  This link may thus have a\n   substantially\
    \ lower bandwidth and higher error rate than traditional\n   wired networks. \
    \ Moreover, mobile nodes are likely to be battery\n   powered, and minimizing\
    \ power consumption is important.  Therefore,\n   the number of administrative\
    \ messages sent over the link by which a\n   mobile node is directly attached\
    \ to the Internet should be minimized,\n   and the size of these messages should\
    \ be kept as small as is\n   reasonably possible.\n"
- title: 1.3. Assumptions
  contents:
  - "1.3. Assumptions\n   The protocols defined in this document place no additional\n\
    \   constraints on the assignment of IP addresses.  That is, a mobile\n   node\
    \ can be assigned an IP address by the organization that owns the\n   machine.\n\
    \   This protocol assumes that mobile nodes will generally not change\n   their\
    \ point of attachment to the Internet more frequently than once\n   per second.\n\
    \   This protocol assumes that IP unicast datagrams are routed based on\n   the\
    \ destination address in the datagram header (and not, for example,\n   by source\
    \ address).\n"
- title: 1.4. Applicability
  contents:
  - "1.4. Applicability\n   Mobile IP is intended to enable nodes to move from one\
    \ IP subnet to\n   another.  It is just as suitable for mobility across homogeneous\n\
    \   media as it is for mobility across heterogeneous media.  That is,\n   Mobile\
    \ IP facilitates node movement from one Ethernet segment to\n   another as well\
    \ as it accommodates node movement from an Ethernet\n   segment to a wireless\
    \ LAN, as long as the mobile node's IP address\n   remains the same after such\
    \ a movement.\n   One can think of Mobile IP as solving the \"macro\" mobility\
    \ management\n   problem.  It is less well suited for more \"micro\" mobility\
    \ management\n   applications -- for example, handoff amongst wireless transceivers,\n\
    \   each of which covers only a very small geographic area.  As long as\n   node\
    \ movement does not occur between points of attachment on\n   different IP subnets,\
    \ link-layer mechanisms for mobility (i.e.,\n   link-layer handoff) may offer\
    \ faster convergence and far less\n   overhead than Mobile IP.\n"
- title: 1.5. New Architectural Entities
  contents:
  - "1.5. New Architectural Entities\n   Mobile IP introduces the following new functional\
    \ entities:\n      Mobile Node\n         A host or router that changes its point\
    \ of attachment from one\n         network or subnetwork to another.  A mobile\
    \ node may change its\n         location without changing its IP address; it may\
    \ continue to\n         communicate with other Internet nodes at any location\
    \ using its\n         (constant) IP address, assuming link-layer connectivity\
    \ to a\n         point of attachment is available.\n      Home Agent\n       \
    \  A router on a mobile node's home network which tunnels\n         datagrams\
    \ for delivery to the mobile node when it is away from\n         home, and maintains\
    \ current location information for the mobile\n         node.\n      Foreign Agent\n\
    \         A router on a mobile node's visited network which provides\n       \
    \  routing services to the mobile node while registered.  The\n         foreign\
    \ agent detunnels and delivers datagrams to the mobile\n         node that were\
    \ tunneled by the mobile node's home agent.  For\n         datagrams sent by a\
    \ mobile node, the foreign agent may serve as\n         a default router for registered\
    \ mobile nodes.\n   A mobile node is given a long-term IP address on a home network.\n\
    \   This home address is administered in the same way as a \"permanent\" IP\n\
    \   address is provided to a stationary host.  When away from its home\n   network,\
    \ a \"care-of address\" is associated with the mobile node and\n   reflects the\
    \ mobile node's current point of attachment.  The mobile\n   node uses its home\
    \ address as the source address of all IP datagrams\n   that it sends, except\
    \ where otherwise described in this document for\n   datagrams sent for certain\
    \ mobility management functions (e.g., as in\n   Section 3.6.1.1).\n"

  - "1.6. Terminology\n   The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\"\
    , \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and\
    \ \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC\
    \ 2119 [4].\n   In addition, this document frequently uses the following terms:\n\
    \      Authorization-enabling extension\n            An authentication which makes\
    \ a (registration) message\n            acceptable to the ultimate recipient of\
    \ the registration\n            message.  An authorization-enabling extension\
    \ MUST contain\n            an SPI.\n            In this document, all uses of\
    \ authorization-enabling\n            extension refer to authentication extensions\
    \ that enable the\n            Registration Request message to be acceptable to\
    \ the home\n            agent.  Using additional protocol structures specified\n\
    \            outside of this document, it may be possible for the mobile\n   \
    \         node to provide authentication of its registration to the\n        \
    \    home agent, by way of another authenticating entity within\n            the\
    \ network that is acceptable to the home agent (for\n            example, see\
    \ RFC 2794 [6]).\n      Agent Advertisement\n            An advertisement message\
    \ constructed by attaching a special\n            Extension to a router advertisement\
    \ [10] message.\n      Authentication\n            The process of verifying (using\
    \ cryptographic techniques,\n            for all applications in this specification)\
    \ the identity of\n            the originator of a message.\n      Care-of Address\n\
    \            The termination point of a tunnel toward a mobile node, for\n   \
    \         datagrams forwarded to the mobile node while it is away from\n     \
    \       home.  The protocol can use two different types of care-of\n         \
    \   address:  a \"foreign agent care-of address\" is an address of\n         \
    \   a foreign agent with which the mobile node is registered,\n            and\
    \ a \"co-located care-of address\" is an externally obtained\n            local\

  - "1.7. Protocol Overview\n   The following support services are defined for Mobile\
    \ IP:\n      Agent Discovery\n            Home agents and foreign agents may advertise\
    \ their\n            availability on each link for which they provide service.\
    \  A\n            newly arrived mobile node can send a solicitation on the\n \
    \           link to learn if any prospective agents are present.\n      Registration\n\
    \            When the mobile node is away from home, it registers its\n      \
    \      care-of address with its home agent.  Depending on its\n            method\
    \ of attachment, the mobile node will register either\n            directly with\
    \ its home agent, or through a foreign agent\n            which forwards the registration\
    \ to the home agent.\n      silently discard\n            The implementation discards\
    \ the datagram without further\n            processing, and without indicating\
    \ an error to the sender.\n            The implementation SHOULD provide the capability\
    \ of logging\n            the error, including the contents of the discarded datagram,\n\
    \            and SHOULD record the event in a statistics counter.\n   The following\
    \ steps provide a rough outline of operation of the\n   Mobile IP protocol:\n\
    \      -  Mobility agents (i.e., foreign agents and home agents)\n         advertise\
    \ their presence via Agent Advertisement messages\n         (Section 2).  A mobile\
    \ node may optionally solicit an Agent\n         Advertisement message from any\
    \ locally attached mobility agents\n         through an Agent Solicitation message.\n\
    \      -  A mobile node receives these Agent Advertisements and\n         determines\
    \ whether it is on its home network or a foreign\n         network.\n      - \
    \ When the mobile node detects that it is located on its home\n         network,\
    \ it operates without mobility services.  If returning\n         to its home network\
    \ from being registered elsewhere, the mobile\n         node deregisters with\
    \ its home agent, through exchange of a\n         Registration Request and Registration\
    \ Reply message with it.\n      -  When a mobile node detects that it has moved\
    \ to a foreign\n         network, it obtains a care-of address on the foreign\
    \ network.\n         The care-of address can either be determined from a foreign\n\
    \         agent's advertisements (a foreign agent care-of address), or by\n  \
    \       some external assignment mechanism such as DHCP [13] (a co-\n        \
    \ located care-of address).\n      -  The mobile node operating away from home\
    \ then registers its new\n         care-of address with its home agent through\
    \ exchange of a\n         Registration Request and Registration Reply message\
    \ with it,\n         possibly via a foreign agent (Section 3).\n      -  Datagrams\
    \ sent to the mobile node's home address are\n         intercepted by its home\
    \ agent, tunneled by the home agent to\n         the mobile node's care-of address,\
    \ received at the tunnel\n         endpoint (either at a foreign agent or at the\
    \ mobile node\n         itself), and finally delivered to the mobile node (Section\n\
    \         4.2.3).\n      -  In the reverse direction, datagrams sent by the mobile\
    \ node are\n         generally delivered to their destination using standard IP\n\
    \         routing mechanisms, not necessarily passing through the home\n     \
    \    agent.\n   When away from home, Mobile IP uses protocol tunneling to hide\
    \ a\n   mobile node's home address from intervening routers between its home\n\
    \   network and its current location.  The tunnel terminates at the\n   mobile\
    \ node's care-of address.  The care-of address must be an\n   address to which\
    \ datagrams can be delivered via conventional IP\n   routing.  At the care-of\
    \ address, the original datagram is removed\n   from the tunnel and delivered\
    \ to the mobile node.\n   Mobile IP provides two alternative modes for the acquisition\
    \ of a\n   care-of address:\n      a) A \"foreign agent care-of address\" is a\
    \ care-of address provided\n         by a foreign agent through its Agent Advertisement\
    \ messages.\n         In this case, the care-of address is an IP address of the\n\
    \         foreign agent.  In this mode, the foreign agent is the endpoint\n  \
    \       of the tunnel and, upon receiving tunneled datagrams,\n         decapsulates\
    \ them and delivers the inner datagram to the mobile\n         node.  This mode\
    \ of acquisition is preferred because it allows\n         many mobile nodes to\
    \ share the same care-of address and\n         therefore does not place unnecessary\
    \ demands on the already\n         limited IPv4 address space.\n      b) A \"\
    co-located care-of address\" is a care-of address acquired by\n         the mobile\
    \ node as a local IP address through some external\n         means, which the\
    \ mobile node then associates with one of its\n         own network interfaces.\
    \  The address may be dynamically\n         acquired as a temporary address by\
    \ the mobile node such as\n         through DHCP [13], or may be owned by the\
    \ mobile node as a\n         long-term address for its use only while visiting\
    \ some foreign\n         network.  Specific external methods of acquiring a local\
    \ IP\n         address for use as a co-located care-of address are beyond the\n\
    \         scope of this document.  When using a co-located care-of\n         address,\
    \ the mobile node serves as the endpoint of the tunnel\n         and itself performs\
    \ decapsulation of the datagrams tunneled to\n         it.\n   The mode of using\
    \ a co-located care-of address has the advantage that\n   it allows a mobile node\
    \ to function without a foreign agent, for\n   example, in networks that have\
    \ not yet deployed a foreign agent.  It\n   does, however, place additional burden\
    \ on the IPv4 address space\n   because it requires a pool of addresses within\
    \ the foreign network to\n   be made available to visiting mobile nodes.  It is\
    \ difficult to\n   efficiently maintain pools of addresses for each subnet that\
    \ may\n   permit mobile nodes to visit.\n   It is important to understand the\
    \ distinction between the care-of\n   address and the foreign agent functions.\
    \  The care-of address is\n   simply the endpoint of the tunnel.  It might indeed\
    \ be an address of\n   a foreign agent (a foreign agent care-of address), but\
    \ it might\n   instead be an address temporarily acquired by the mobile node (a\
    \ co-\n   located care-of address).  A foreign agent, on the other hand, is a\n\
    \   mobility agent that provides services to mobile nodes.  See Sections\n   3.7\
    \ and 4.2.2 for additional details.\n   For example, figure 1 illustrates the\
    \ routing of datagrams to and\n   from a mobile node away from home, once the\
    \ mobile node has\n   registered with its home agent.  In figure 1, the mobile\
    \ node is\n   using a foreign agent care-of address, not a co-located care-of\n\
    \   address.\n              2) Datagram is intercepted   3) Datagram is\n    \
    \             by home agent and            detunneled and\n                 is\
    \ tunneled to the           delivered to the\n                 care-of address.\

    \ that are\n   destined to the home address of any of its registered mobile nodes.\n\
    \   Using the proxy and gratuitous ARP mechanisms described in Section\n   4.6,\
    \ this requirement can be satisfied if the home agent has a\n   network interface\
    \ on the link indicated by the mobile node's home\n   address.  Other placements\
    \ of the home agent relative to the mobile\n   node's home location MAY also be\
    \ possible using other mechanisms for\n   intercepting datagrams destined to the\
    \ mobile node's home address.\n   Such placements are beyond the scope of this\
    \ document.\n   Similarly, a mobile node and a prospective or current foreign\
    \ agent\n   MUST be able to exchange datagrams without relying on standard IP\n\
    \   routing mechanisms; that is, those mechanisms which make forwarding\n   decisions\
    \ based upon the network-prefix of the destination address in\n   the IP header.\
    \  This requirement can be satisfied if the foreign\n   agent and the visiting\
    \ mobile node have an interface on the same\n   link.  In this case, the mobile\
    \ node and foreign agent simply bypass\n   their normal IP routing mechanism when\
    \ sending datagrams to each\n   other, addressing the underlying link-layer packets\
    \ to their\n   respective link-layer addresses.  Other placements of the foreign\n\
    \   agent relative to the mobile node MAY also be possible using other\n   mechanisms\
    \ to exchange datagrams between these nodes, but such\n   placements are beyond\
    \ the scope of this document.\n   If a mobile node is using a co-located care-of\
    \ address (as described\n   in (b) above), the mobile node MUST be located on\
    \ the link identified\n   by the network prefix of this care-of address.  Otherwise,\
    \ datagrams\n   destined to the care-of address would be undeliverable.\n"

  contents:
  - "1.8. Message Format and Protocol Extensibility\n   Mobile IP defines a set of\
    \ new control messages, sent with UDP [37]\n   using well-known port number 434.\
    \  The following two message types\n   are defined in this document:\n      1\
    \  Registration Request\n      3  Registration Reply\n      Up-to-date values\
    \ for the message types for Mobile IP control\n      messages are specified in\
    \ the most recent \"Assigned Numbers\" [40].\n      In addition, for Agent Discovery,\
    \ Mobile IP makes use of the\n      existing Router Advertisement and Router Solicitation\
    \ messages\n      defined for ICMP Router Discovery [10].\n      Mobile IP defines\
    \ a general Extension mechanism to allow optional\n      information to be carried\
    \ by Mobile IP control messages or by ICMP\n      Router Discovery messages. \
    \ Some extensions have been specified to\n      be encoded in the simple Type-Length-Value\
    \ format described in\n      Section 1.9.\n      Extensions allow variable amounts\
    \ of information to be carried\n      within each datagram.  The end of the list\
    \ of Extensions is\n      indicated by the total length of the IP datagram.\n\
    \      Two separately maintained sets of numbering spaces, from which\n      Extension\
    \ Type values are allocated, are used in Mobile IP:\n      -  The first set consists\
    \ of those Extensions which may appear\n         only in Mobile IP control messages\
    \ (those sent to and from UDP\n         port number 434).  In this document, the\
    \ following Types are\n         defined for Extensions appearing in Mobile IP\
    \ control messages:\n            32  Mobile-Home Authentication\n            33\
    \  Mobile-Foreign Authentication\n            34  Foreign-Home Authentication\n\
    \      -  The second set consists of those extensions which may appear\n     \
    \    only in ICMP Router Discovery messages [10].  In this document,\n       \
    \  the following Types are defined for Extensions appearing in\n         ICMP\
    \ Router Discovery messages:\n             0  One-byte Padding (encoded with no\
    \ Length nor Data field)\n            16  Mobility Agent Advertisement\n     \
    \       19  Prefix-Lengths\n   Each individual Extension is described in detail\
    \ in a separate\n   section later in this document.  Up-to-date values for these\n\
    \   Extension Type numbers are specified in the most recent \"Assigned\n   Numbers\"\
    \ [40].\n   Due to the separation (orthogonality) of these sets, it is\n   conceivable\
    \ that two Extensions that are defined at a later date\n   could have identical\
    \ Type values, so long as one of the Extensions\n   may be used only in Mobile\
    \ IP control messages and the other may be\n   used only in ICMP Router Discovery\
    \ messages.\n   The type field in the Mobile IP extension structure can support\
    \ up to\n   255 (skippable and not skippable) uniquely identifiable extensions.\n\
    \   When an Extension numbered in either of these sets within the range 0\n  \
    \ through 127 is encountered but not recognized, the message containing\n   that\
    \ Extension MUST be silently discarded.  When an Extension\n   numbered in the\
    \ range 128 through 255 is encountered which is not\n   recognized, that particular\
    \ Extension is ignored, but the rest of the\n   Extensions and message data MUST\
    \ still be processed.  The Length\n   field of the Extension is used to skip the\
    \ Data field in searching\n   for the next Extension.\n   Unless additional structure\
    \ is utilized for the extension types, new\n   developments or additions to Mobile\
    \ IP might require so many new\n   extensions that the available space for extension\
    \ types might run\n   out.  Two new extension structures are proposed to solve\
    \ this\n   problem.  Certain types of extensions can be aggregated, using\n  \
    \ subtypes to identify the precise extension, for example as has been\n   done\
    \ with the Generic Authentication Keys extensions [35].  In many\n   cases, this\
    \ may reduce the rate of allocation for new values of the\n   type field.\n  \
    \ Since the new extension structures will cause an efficient usage of\n   the\
    \ extension type space, it is recommended that new Mobile IP\n   extensions follow\
    \ one of the two new extension formats whenever there\n   may be the possibility\
    \ to group related extensions together.\n   The following subsections provide\
    \ details about three distinct\n   structures for Mobile IP extensions:\n    \

  contents:
  - "2. Agent Discovery\n   Agent Discovery is the method by which a mobile node determines\n\
    \   whether it is currently connected to its home network or to a foreign\n  \
    \ network, and by which a mobile node can detect when it has moved from\n   one\
    \ network to another.  When connected to a foreign network, the\n   methods specified\
    \ in this section also allow the mobile node to\n   determine the foreign agent\
    \ care-of address being offered by each\n   foreign agent on that network.\n \
    \  Mobile IP extends ICMP Router Discovery [10] as its primary mechanism\n   for\
    \ Agent Discovery.  An Agent Advertisement is formed by including a\n   Mobility\
    \ Agent Advertisement Extension in an ICMP Router\n   Advertisement message (Section\
    \ 2.1).  An Agent Solicitation message\n   is identical to an ICMP Router Solicitation,\
    \ except that its IP TTL\n   MUST be set to 1 (Section 2.2).  This section describes\
    \ the message\n   formats and procedures by which mobile nodes, foreign agents,\
    \ and\n   home agents cooperate to realize Agent Discovery.\n   Agent Advertisement\
    \ and Agent Solicitation may not be necessary for\n   link layers that already\
    \ provide this functionality.  The method by\n   which mobile nodes establish\
    \ link-layer connections with prospective\n   agents is outside the scope of this\
    \ document (but see Appendix B).\n   The procedures described below assume that\
    \ such link-layer\n   connectivity has already been established.\n   No authentication\
    \ is required for Agent Advertisement and Agent\n   Solicitation messages.  They\
    \ MAY be authenticated using the IP\n   Authentication Header [22], which is unrelated\
    \ to the messages\n   described in this document.  Further specification of the\
    \ way in\n   which Advertisement and Solicitation messages may be authenticated\
    \ is\n   outside of the scope of this document.\n"

  contents:
  - "2.1. Agent Advertisement\n   Agent Advertisements are transmitted by a mobility\
    \ agent to advertise\n   its services on a link.  Mobile nodes use these advertisements\
    \ to\n   determine their current point of attachment to the Internet.  An\n  \
    \ Agent Advertisement is an ICMP Router Advertisement that has been\n   extended\
    \ to also carry an Mobility Agent Advertisement Extension\n   (Section 2.1.1)\
    \ and, optionally, a Prefix-Lengths Extension (Section\n   2.1.2), One-byte Padding\
    \ Extension (Section 2.1.3), or other\n   Extensions that might be defined in\
    \ the future.\n   Within an Agent Advertisement message, ICMP Router Advertisement\n\
    \   fields of the message are required to conform to the following\n   additional\
    \ specifications:\n      -  Link-Layer Fields\n         Destination Address\n\
    \               The link-layer destination address of a unicast Agent\n      \

    \     address of the Agent Solicitation which prompted the\n               Advertisement.\n\
    \      -  IP Fields\n         TTL      The TTL for all Agent Advertisements MUST\

    \ \"all systems on this link\" multicast\n               address (224.0.0.1) [11]\
    \ or the \"limited broadcast\"\n               address (255.255.255.255).  The\
    \ subnet-directed broadcast\n               address of the form <prefix>.<-1>\
    \ cannot be used since\n               mobile nodes will not generally know the\

    \ is unicast\n               to a mobile node, the IP home address of the mobile\

- title: 2.4. Mobile Node Considerations
  contents:
  - "2.4. Mobile Node Considerations\n   Every mobile node MUST implement Agent Solicitation.\
    \  Solicitations\n   SHOULD only be sent in the absence of Agent Advertisements\
    \ and when a\n   care-of address has not been determined through a link-layer\
    \ protocol\n   or other means.  The mobile node uses the same procedures, defaults,\n\
    \   and constants for Agent Solicitation as specified for ICMP Router\n   Solicitation\
    \ messages [10], except that the mobile node MAY solicit\n   more often than once\
    \ every three seconds, and that a mobile node that\n   is currently not connected\
    \ to any foreign agent MAY solicit more\n   times than MAX_SOLICITATIONS.\n  \
    \ The rate at which a mobile node sends Solicitations MUST be limited\n   by the\
    \ mobile node.  The mobile node MAY send three initial\n   Solicitations at a\
    \ maximum rate of one per second while searching for\n   an agent.  After this,\
    \ the rate at which Solicitations are sent MUST\n   be reduced so as to limit\
    \ the overhead on the local link.  Subsequent\n   Solicitations MUST be sent using\
    \ a binary exponential backoff\n   mechanism, doubling the interval between consecutive\
    \ Solicitations,\n   up to a maximum interval.  The maximum interval SHOULD be\
    \ chosen\n   appropriately based upon the characteristics of the media over which\n\
    \   the mobile node is soliciting.  This maximum interval SHOULD be at\n   least\
    \ one minute between Solicitations.\n   While still searching for an agent, the\
    \ mobile node MUST NOT increase\n   the rate at which it sends Solicitations unless\
    \ it has received a\n   positive indication that it has moved to a new link. \
    \ After\n   successfully registering with an agent, the mobile node SHOULD also\n\
    \   increase the rate at which it will send Solicitations when it next\n   begins\
    \ searching for a new agent with which to register.  The\n   increased solicitation\
    \ rate MAY revert to the maximum rate, but then\n   MUST be limited in the manner\
    \ described above.  In all cases, the\n   recommended solicitation intervals are\
    \ nominal values.  Mobile nodes\n   MUST randomize their solicitation times around\
    \ these nominal values\n   as specified for ICMP Router Discovery [10].\n   Mobile\
    \ nodes MUST process received Agent Advertisements.  A mobile\n   node can distinguish\
    \ an Agent Advertisement message from other uses\n   of the ICMP Router Advertisement\
    \ message by examining the number of\n   advertised addresses and the IP Total\
    \ Length field.  When the IP\n   total length indicates that the ICMP message\
    \ is longer than needed\n   for the number of advertised addresses, the remaining\
    \ data is\n   interpreted as one or more Extensions.  The presence of a Mobility\n\
    \   Agent Advertisement Extension identifies the advertisement as an\n   Agent\
    \ Advertisement.\n   If there is more than one advertised address, the mobile\
    \ node SHOULD\n   pick the first address for its initial registration attempt.\
    \  If the\n   registration attempt fails with a status Code indicating rejection\
    \ by\n   the foreign agent, the mobile node MAY retry the attempt with each\n\
    \   subsequent advertised address in turn.\n   When multiple methods of agent\
    \ discovery are in use, the mobile node\n   SHOULD first attempt registration\
    \ with agents including Mobility\n   Agent Advertisement Extensions in their advertisements,\
    \ in preference\n   to those discovered by other means.  This preference maximizes\
    \ the\n   likelihood that the registration will be recognized, thereby\n   minimizing\
    \ the number of registration attempts.\n   A mobile node MUST ignore reserved\
    \ bits in Agent Advertisements, as\n   opposed to discarding such advertisements.\
    \  In this way, new bits can\n   be defined later, without affecting the ability\
    \ for mobile nodes to\n   use the advertisements even when the newly defined bits\
    \ are not\n   understood.\n"

  contents:
  - "2.4.1. Registration Required\n   When the mobile node receives an Agent Advertisement\
    \ with the 'R' bit\n   set, the mobile node SHOULD register through the foreign\
    \ agent, even\n   when the mobile node might be able to acquire its own co-located\n\
    \   care-of address.  This feature is intended to allow sites to enforce\n   visiting\
    \ policies (such as accounting) which require exchanges of\n   authorization.\n\
    \   If formerly reserved bits require some kind of monitoring/enforcement\n  \
    \ at the foreign link, foreign agents implementing the new\n   specification for\
    \ the formerly reserved bits can set the 'R' bit.\n   This has the effect of forcing\
    \ the mobile node to register through\n   the foreign agent, so the foreign agent\

    \   SHOULD register (Section 3) with a suitable care-of address on the\n   new\
    \ foreign network.  However, the mobile node MUST NOT register more\n   frequently\
    \ than once per second on average, as specified in Section\n   3.6.3.\n"
- title: 2.4.2.1. Algorithm 1
  contents:
  - "2.4.2.1. Algorithm 1\n   The first method of move detection is based upon the\
    \ Lifetime field\n   within the main body of the ICMP Router Advertisement portion\
    \ of the\n   Agent Advertisement.  A mobile node SHOULD record the Lifetime\n\
    \   received in any Agent Advertisements, until that Lifetime expires.\n   If\
    \ the mobile node fails to receive another advertisement from the\n   same agent\
    \ within the specified Lifetime, it SHOULD assume that it\n   has lost contact\
    \ with that agent.  If the mobile node has previously\n   received an Agent Advertisement\
    \ from another agent for which the\n   Lifetime field has not yet expired, the\
    \ mobile node MAY immediately\n   attempt registration with that other agent.\
    \  Otherwise, the mobile\n   node SHOULD attempt to discover a new agent with\
    \ which to register.\n"
- title: 2.4.2.2. Algorithm 2
  contents:
  - "2.4.2.2. Algorithm 2\n   The second method uses network prefixes.  The Prefix-Lengths\n\
    \   Extension MAY be used in some cases by a mobile node to determine\n   whether\
    \ or not a newly received Agent Advertisement was received on\n   the same subnet\
    \ as the mobile node's current care-of address.  If the\n   prefixes differ, the\
    \ mobile node MAY assume that it has moved.  If a\n   mobile node is currently\
    \ using a foreign agent care-of address, the\n   mobile node SHOULD NOT use this\
    \ method of move detection unless both\n   the current agent and the new agent\
    \ include the Prefix-Lengths\n   Extension in their respective Agent Advertisements;\
    \ if this Extension\n   is missing from one or both of the advertisements, this\
    \ method of\n   move detection SHOULD NOT be used.  Similarly, if a mobile node\
    \ is\n   using a co-located care-of address, it SHOULD not use this method of\n\
    \   move detection unless the new agent includes the Prefix-Lengths\n   Extension\
    \ in its Advertisement and the mobile node knows the network\n   prefix of its\
    \ current co-located care-of address.  On the expiration\n   of its current registration,\
    \ if this method indicates that the mobile\n   node has moved, rather than re-registering\
    \ with its current care-of\n   address, a mobile node MAY choose instead to register\
    \ with a the\n   foreign agent sending the new Advertisement with the different\n\
    \   network prefix.  The Agent Advertisement on which the new\n   registration\
    \ is based MUST NOT have expired according to its Lifetime\n   field.\n"

    \   attempting to deregister, the mobile node SHOULD configure its\n   routing\

  - "3. Registration\n   Mobile IP registration provides a flexible mechanism for\

- title: 3.1. Registration Overview
  contents:
  - "3.1. Registration Overview\n   Mobile IP defines two different registration procedures,\
    \ one via a\n   foreign agent that relays the registration to the mobile node's\
    \ home\n   agent, and one directly with the mobile node's home agent.  The\n \
    \  following rules determine which of these two registration procedures\n   to\
    \ use in any particular circumstance:\n      -  If a mobile node is registering\
    \ a foreign agent care-of\n         address, the mobile node MUST register via\
    \ that foreign agent.\n      -  If a mobile node is using a co-located care-of\
    \ address, and\n         receives an Agent Advertisement from a foreign agent\
    \ on the\n         link on which it is using this care-of address, the mobile\
    \ node\n         SHOULD register via that foreign agent (or via another foreign\n\
    \         agent on this link) if the 'R' bit is set in the received Agent\n  \
    \       Advertisement message.\n      -  If a mobile node is otherwise using a\
    \ co-located care-of\n         address, the mobile node MUST register directly\
    \ with its home\n         agent.\n      -  If a mobile node has returned to its\
    \ home network and is\n         (de)registering with its home agent, the mobile\
    \ node MUST\n         register directly with its home agent.\n   Both registration\
    \ procedures involve the exchange of Registration\n   Request and Registration\
    \ Reply messages (Sections 3.3 and 3.4).  When\n   registering via a foreign agent,\
    \ the registration procedure requires\n   the following four messages:\n     \
    \ a) The mobile node sends a Registration Request to the prospective\n       \
    \  foreign agent to begin the registration process.\n      b) The foreign agent\
    \ processes the Registration Request and then\n         relays it to the home\
    \ agent.\n      c) The home agent sends a Registration Reply to the foreign agent\n\
    \         to grant or deny the Request.\n      d) The foreign agent processes\
    \ the Registration Reply and then\n         relays it to the mobile node to inform\
    \ it of the disposition of\n         its Request.\n   When the mobile node instead\
    \ registers directly with its home agent,\n   the registration procedure requires\
    \ only the following two messages:\n      a) The mobile node sends a Registration\
    \ Request to the home agent.\n      b) The home agent sends a Registration Reply\
    \ to the mobile node,\n         granting or denying the Request.\n   The registration\
    \ messages defined in Sections 3.3 and 3.4 use the\n   User Datagram Protocol\
    \ (UDP) [37].  A nonzero UDP checksum SHOULD be\n   included in the header, and\
    \ MUST be checked by the recipient.  A zero\n   UDP checksum SHOULD be accepted\
    \ by the recipient.  The behavior of\n   the mobile node and the home agent with\
    \ respect to their mutual\n   acceptance of packets with zero UDP checksums SHOULD\
    \ be defined as\n   part of the mobility security association which exists between\
    \ them.\n"

  - "3.6. Mobile Node Considerations\n   A mobile node MUST be configured with a netmask\
    \ and a mobility\n   security association for each of its home agents.  In addition,\
    \ a\n   mobile node MAY be configured with its home address, and the IP\n   address\
    \ of one or more of its home agents; otherwise, the mobile node\n   MAY discover\
    \ a home agent using the procedures described in Section\n   3.6.1.2.\n   If the\
    \ mobile node is not configured with a home address, it MAY use\n   the Mobile\
    \ Node NAI extension [6] to identify itself, and set the\n   Home Address field\
    \ of the Registration Request to 0.0.0.0.  In this\n   case, the mobile node MUST\
    \ be able to assign its home address after\n   extracting this information from\
    \ the Registration Reply from the home\n   agent.\n   For each pending registration,\
    \ the mobile node maintains the\n   following information:\n      -  the link-layer\
    \ address of the foreign agent to which the\n         Registration Request was\
    \ sent, if applicable,\n      -  the IP destination address of the Registration\
    \ Request,\n      -  the care-of address used in the registration,\n      -  the\
    \ Identification value sent in the registration,\n      -  the originally requested\
    \ Lifetime, and\n      -  the remaining Lifetime of the pending registration.\n\
    \   A mobile node SHOULD initiate a registration whenever it detects a\n   change\
    \ in its network connectivity.  See Section 2.4.2 for methods by\n   which mobile\
    \ nodes MAY make such a determination.  When it is away\n   from home, the mobile\
    \ node's Registration Request allows its home\n   agent to create or modify a\
    \ mobility binding for it.  When it is at\n   home, the mobile node's (de)Registration\
    \ Request allows its home\n   agent to delete any previous mobility binding(s)\
    \ for it.  A mobile\n   node operates without the support of mobility functions\
    \ when it is at\n   home.\n   There are other conditions under which the mobile\
    \ node SHOULD\n   (re)register with its foreign agent, such as when the mobile\
    \ node\n   detects that the foreign agent has rebooted (as specified in Section\n\
    \   2.4.4) and when the current registration's Lifetime is near\n   expiration.\n\
    \   In the absence of link-layer indications of changes in point of\n   attachment,\
    \ Agent Advertisements from new agents SHOULD NOT cause a\n   mobile node to attempt\
    \ a new registration, if its current\n   registration has not expired and it is\
    \ still also receiving Agent\n   Advertisements from the foreign agent with which\
    \ it is currently\n   registered.  In the absence of link-layer indications, a\
    \ mobile node\n   MUST NOT attempt to register more often than once per second.\n\
    \   A mobile node MAY register with a different agent when transport-\n   layer\
    \ protocols indicate excessive retransmissions.  A mobile node\n   MUST NOT consider\
    \ reception of an ICMP Redirect from a foreign agent\n   that is currently providing\
    \ service to it as reason to register with\n   a new foreign agent.  Within these\
    \ constraints, the mobile node MAY\n   register again at any time.\n   Appendix\

    \ the\n         IP source address MUST be 0.0.0.0.\n      -  In all other circumstances,\
    \ the IP source address MUST be the\n         mobile node's home address.\n  \
    \ IP Destination Address:\n      -  When the mobile node has discovered the agent\
    \ with which it is\n         registering, through some means (e.g., link-layer)\
    \ that does\n         not provide the IP address of the agent (the IP address\
    \ of the\n         agent is unknown to the mobile node), then the \"All Mobility\n\
    \         Agents\" multicast address (224.0.0.11) MUST be used.  In this\n   \
    \      case, the mobile node MUST use the agent's link-layer unicast\n       \
    \  address in order to deliver the datagram to the correct agent.\n      -  When\
    \ registering with a foreign agent, the address of the agent\n         as learned\
    \ from the IP source address of the corresponding\n         Agent Advertisement\
    \ MUST be used.  This MAY be an address which\n         does not appear as an\
    \ advertised care-of address in the Agent\n         Advertisement.  In addition,\
    \ when transmitting this\n         Registration Request message, the mobile node\
    \ MUST use a link-\n         layer destination address copied from the link-layer\
    \ source\n         address of the Agent Advertisement message in which it learned\n\

  contents:
  - "3.6.1.2. Registration Request Fields\n   This section provides specific rules\
    \ by which mobile nodes pick\n   values for the fields within the fixed portion\
    \ of a Registration\n   Request.\n   A mobile node MAY set the 'S' bit in order\
    \ to request that the home\n   agent maintain prior mobility binding(s).  Otherwise,\
    \ the home agent\n   deletes any previous binding(s) and replaces them with the\
    \ new\n   binding specified in the Registration Request.  Multiple simultaneous\n\
    \   mobility bindings are likely to be useful when a mobile node using at\n  \
    \ least one wireless network interface moves within wireless\n   transmission\
    \ range of more than one foreign agent.  IP explicitly\n   allows duplication\
    \ of datagrams.  When the home agent allows\n   simultaneous bindings, it will\
    \ tunnel a separate copy of each\n   arriving datagram to each care-of address,\
    \ and the mobile node will\n   receive multiple copies of datagrams destined to\
    \ it.\n   The mobile node SHOULD set the 'D' bit if it is registering with a\n\
    \   co-located care-of address.  Otherwise, the 'D' bit MUST NOT be set.\n   A\
    \ mobile node MAY set the 'B' bit to request its home agent to\n   forward to\
    \ it, a copy of broadcast datagrams received by its home\n   agent from the home\
    \ network.  The method used by the home agent to\n   forward broadcast datagrams\
    \ depends on the type of care-of address\n   registered by the mobile node, as\
    \ determined by the 'D' bit in the\n   mobile node's Registration Request:\n \
    \     -  If the 'D' bit is set, then the mobile node has indicated that\n    \
    \     it will decapsulate any datagrams tunneled to this care-of\n         address\
    \ itself (the mobile node is using a co-located care-of\n         address).  In\
    \ this case, to forward such a received broadcast\n         datagram to the mobile\
    \ node, the home agent MUST tunnel it to\n         this care-of address.  The\
    \ mobile node de-tunnels the received\n         datagram in the same way as any\
    \ other datagram tunneled\n         directly to it.\n      -  If the 'D' bit is\
    \ NOT set, then the mobile node has indicated\n         that it is using a foreign\
    \ agent care-of address, and that the\n         foreign agent will thus decapsulate\
    \ arriving datagrams before\n         forwarding them to the mobile node.  In\
    \ this case, to forward\n         such a received broadcast datagram to the mobile\
    \ node, the home\n         agent MUST first encapsulate the broadcast datagram\
    \ in a\n         unicast datagram addressed to the mobile node's home address,\n\
    \         and then MUST tunnel this resulting datagram to the mobile\n       \
    \  node's care-of address.\n         When decapsulated by the foreign agent, the\
    \ inner datagram will\n         thus be a unicast IP datagram addressed to the\
    \ mobile node,\n         identifying to the foreign agent the intended destination\
    \ of\n         the encapsulated broadcast datagram, and will be delivered to\n\
    \         the mobile node in the same way as any tunneled datagram\n         arriving\
    \ for the mobile node.  The foreign agent MUST NOT\n         decapsulate the encapsulated\
    \ broadcast datagram and MUST NOT\n         use a local network broadcast to transmit\
    \ it to the mobile\n         node.  The mobile node thus MUST decapsulate the\
    \ encapsulated\n         broadcast datagram itself, and thus MUST NOT set the\
    \ 'B' bit in\n         its Registration Request in this case unless it is capable\
    \ of\n         decapsulating datagrams.\n   The mobile node MAY request alternative\
    \ forms of encapsulation by\n   setting the 'M' bit and/or the 'G' bit, but only\
    \ if the mobile node\n   is decapsulating its own datagrams (the mobile node is\
    \ using a co-\n   located care-of address) or if its foreign agent has indicated\n\
    \   support for these forms of encapsulation by setting the corresponding\n  \
    \ bits in the Mobility Agent Advertisement Extension of an Agent\n   Advertisement\
    \ received by the mobile node.  Otherwise, the mobile\n   node MUST NOT set these\
    \ bits.\n   The Lifetime field is chosen as follows:\n      -  If the mobile node\
    \ is registering with a foreign agent, the\n         Lifetime SHOULD NOT exceed\
    \ the value in the Registration\n         Lifetime field of the Agent Advertisement\
    \ message received from\n         the foreign agent.\n         When the method\
    \ by which the care-of address is learned does\n         not include a Lifetime,\
    \ the default ICMP Router Advertisement\n         Lifetime (1800 seconds) MAY\
    \ be used.\n      -  The mobile node MAY ask a home agent to delete a particular\n\
    \         mobility binding, by sending a Registration Request with the\n     \
    \    care-of address for this binding, with the Lifetime field set\n         to\
    \ zero (Section 3.8.2).\n      -  Similarly, a Lifetime of zero is used when the\
    \ mobile node\n         deregisters all care-of addresses, such as upon returning\
    \ home.\n   The Home Address field MUST be set to the mobile node's home address,\n\
    \   if this information is known.  Otherwise, the Home Address MUST be\n   set\
    \ to zeroes.\n   The Home Agent field MUST be set to the address of the mobile\
    \ node's\n   home agent, if the mobile node knows this address.  Otherwise, the\n\
    \   mobile node MAY use dynamic home agent address resolution to learn\n   the\
    \ address of its home agent.  In this case, the mobile node MUST\n   set the Home\
    \ Agent field to the subnet-directed broadcast address of\n   the mobile node's\
    \ home network.  Each home agent receiving such a\n   Registration Request with\
    \ a broadcast destination address MUST reject\n   the mobile node's registration\
    \ and SHOULD return a rejection\n   Registration Reply indicating its unicast\
    \ IP address for use by the\n   mobile node in a future registration attempt.\n\
    \   The Care-of Address field MUST be set to the value of the particular\n   care-of\
    \ address that the mobile node wishes to (de)register.  In the\n   special case\
    \ in which a mobile node wishes to deregister all care-of\n   addresses, it MUST\
    \ set this field to its home address.\n   The mobile node chooses the Identification\
    \ field in accordance with\n   the style of replay protection it uses with its\
    \ home agent.  This is\n   part of the mobility security association the mobile\
    \ node shares with\n   its home agent.  See Section 5.7 for the method by which\

    \ node operates without\n   the support of mobility services.  That is, it operates\
    \ in the same\n   way as any other (fixed) host or router.  The method by which\
    \ a\n   mobile node selects a default router when connected to its home\n   network,\
    \ or when away from home and using a co-located care-of\n   address, is outside\
    \ the scope of this document.  ICMP Router\n   Advertisement [10] is one such\
    \ method.\n   When registered on a foreign network, the mobile node chooses a\n\
    \   default router by the following rules:\n      -  If the mobile node is registered\
    \ using a foreign agent care-of\n         address, it MAY use its foreign agent\
    \ as a first-hop router.\n         The foreign agent's MAC address can be learned\
    \ from Agent\n         Advertisement.  Otherwise, the mobile node MUST choose\

    \ router.\n         The network prefix MAY be obtained from the Prefix-Lengths\n\

  - "4.2.3. Home Agent Considerations\n   The home agent MUST be able to intercept\
    \ any datagrams on the home\n   network addressed to the mobile node while the\
    \ mobile node is\n   registered away from home.  Proxy and gratuitous ARP MAY\
    \ be used in\n   enabling this interception, as specified in Section 4.6.\n  \
    \ The home agent must examine the IP Destination Address of all\n   arriving datagrams\
    \ to see if it is equal to the home address of any\n   of its mobile nodes registered\
    \ away from home.  If so, the home agent\n   tunnels the datagram to the mobile\
    \ node's currently registered care-\n   of address or addresses.  If the home\
    \ agent supports the optional\n   capability of multiple simultaneous mobility\
    \ bindings, it tunnels a\n   copy to each care-of address in the mobile node's\
    \ mobility binding\n   list.  If the mobile node has no current mobility bindings,\
    \ the home\n   agent MUST NOT attempt to intercept datagrams destined for the\
    \ mobile\n   node, and thus will not in general receive such datagrams.  However,\n\
    \   if the home agent is also a router handling common IP traffic, it is\n   possible\
    \ that it will receive such datagrams for forwarding onto the\n   home network.\
    \  In this case, the home agent MUST assume the mobile\n   node is at home and\
    \ simply forward the datagram directly onto the\n   home network.\n   For multihomed\
    \ home agents, the source address in the outer IP header\n   of the encapsulated\
    \ datagram MUST be the address sent to the mobile\n   node in the home agent field\
    \ of the registration reply.  That is, the\n   home agent cannot use the the address\
    \ of some other network interface\n   as the source address.\n   See Section 4.1\
    \ regarding methods of encapsulation that may be used\n   for tunneling.  Nodes\
    \ implementing tunneling SHOULD also implement\n   the \"tunnel soft state\" mechanism\
    \ [32], which allows ICMP error\n   messages returned from the tunnel to correctly\
    \ be reflected back to\n   the original senders of the tunneled datagrams.\n \
    \  Home agents MUST decapsulate packets addressed to themselves, sent by\n   a\
    \ mobile node for the purpose of maintaining location privacy, as\n   described\
    \ in Section 5.5.  This feature is also required for support\n   of reverse tunneling\
    \ [27].\n   If the Lifetime for a given mobility binding expires before the home\n\
    \   agent has received another valid Registration Request for that mobile\n  \
    \ node, then that binding is deleted from the mobility binding list.\n   The home\
    \ agent MUST NOT send any Registration Reply message simply\n   because the mobile\
    \ node's binding has expired.  The entry in the\n   visitor list of the mobile\
    \ node's current foreign agent will expire\n   naturally, probably at the same\
    \ time as the binding expired at the\n   home agent.  When a mobility binding's\
    \ lifetime expires, the home\n   agent MUST delete the binding, but it MUST retain\
    \ any other (non-\n   expired) simultaneous mobility bindings that it holds for\
    \ the mobile\n   node.\n   When a home agent receives a datagram, intercepted\
    \ for one of its\n   mobile nodes registered away from home, the home agent MUST\
    \ examine\n   the datagram to check if it is already encapsulated.  If so, special\n\
    \   rules apply in the forwarding of that datagram to the mobile node:\n     \
    \ -  If the inner (encapsulated) Destination Address is the same as\n        \
    \ the outer Destination Address (the mobile node), then the home\n         agent\
    \ MUST also examine the outer Source Address of the\n         encapsulated datagram\
    \ (the source address of the tunnel).  If\n         this outer Source Address\
    \ is the same as the mobile node's\n         current care-of address, the home\
    \ agent MUST silently discard\n         that datagram in order to prevent a likely\
    \ routing loop.  If,\n         instead, the outer Source Address is NOT the same\
    \ as the mobile\n         node's current care-of address, then the home agent\
    \ SHOULD\n         forward the datagram to the mobile node.  In order to forward\n\
    \         the datagram in this case, the home agent MAY simply alter the\n   \
    \      outer Destination Address to the care-of address, rather than\n       \
    \  re-encapsulating the datagram.\n      -  Otherwise (the inner Destination Address\
    \ is NOT the same as the\n         outer Destination Address), the home agent\
    \ SHOULD encapsulate\n         the datagram again (nested encapsulation), with\
    \ the new outer\n         Destination Address set equal to the mobile node's care-of\n\
    \         address.  That is, the home agent forwards the entire datagram\n   \
    \      to the mobile node in the same way as any other datagram\n         (encapsulated\
    \ already or not).\n"
- title: 4.3. Broadcast Datagrams
  contents:
  - "4.3. Broadcast Datagrams\n   When a home agent receives a broadcast datagram,\
    \ it MUST NOT forward\n   the datagram to any mobile nodes in its mobility binding\
    \ list other\n   than those that have requested forwarding of broadcast datagrams.\
    \  A\n   mobile node MAY request forwarding of broadcast datagrams by setting\n\
    \   the 'B' bit in its Registration Request message (Section 3.3).  For\n   each\
    \ such registered mobile node, the home agent SHOULD forward\n   received broadcast\
    \ datagrams to the mobile node, although it is a\n   matter of configuration at\
    \ the home agent as to which specific\n   categories of broadcast datagrams will\
    \ be forwarded to such mobile\n   nodes.\n   If the 'D' bit was set in the mobile\
    \ node's Registration Request\n   message, indicating that the mobile node is\
    \ using a co-located care-\n   of address, the home agent simply tunnels appropriate\
    \ broadcast IP\n   datagrams to the mobile node's care-of address.  Otherwise\
    \ (the 'D'\n   bit was NOT set), the home agent first encapsulates the broadcast\n\
    \   datagram in a unicast datagram addressed to the mobile node's home\n   address,\
    \ and then tunnels this encapsulated datagram to the foreign\n   agent.  This\
    \ extra level of encapsulation is required so that the\n   foreign agent can determine\
    \ which mobile node should receive the\n   datagram after it is decapsulated.\
    \  When received by the foreign\n   agent, the unicast encapsulated datagram is\
    \ detunneled and delivered\n   to the mobile node in the same way as any other\
    \ datagram.  In either\n   case, the mobile node must decapsulate the datagram\
    \ it receives in\n   order to recover the original broadcast datagram.\n"
- title: 4.4. Multicast Datagram Routing
  contents:
  - "4.4. Multicast Datagram Routing\n   As mentioned previously, a mobile node that\
    \ is connected to its home\n   network functions in the same way as any other\
    \ (fixed) host or\n   router.  Thus, when it is at home, a mobile node functions\n\
    \   identically to other multicast senders and receivers.  This section\n   therefore\
    \ describes the behavior of a mobile node that is visiting a\n   foreign network.\n\
    \   In order to receive multicasts, a mobile node MUST join the multicast\n  \
    \ group in one of two ways.  First, a mobile node MAY join the group\n   via a\
    \ (local) multicast router on the visited subnet.  This option\n   assumes that\
    \ there is a multicast router present on the visited\n   subnet.  If the mobile\
    \ node is using a co-located care-of address, it\n   SHOULD use this address as\
    \ the source IP address of its IGMP [11]\n   messages.  Otherwise, it MAY use\
    \ its home address.\n   Alternatively, a mobile node which wishes to receive multicasts\
    \ MAY\n   join groups via a bi-directional tunnel to its home agent, assuming\n\
    \   that its home agent is a multicast router.  The mobile node tunnels\n   IGMP\
    \ messages to its home agent and the home agent forwards multicast\n   datagrams\
    \ down the tunnel to the mobile node.  For packets tunneled\n   to the home agent,\
    \ the source address in the IP header SHOULD be the\n   mobile node's home address.\n\
    \   The rules for multicast datagram delivery to mobile nodes in this\n   case\
    \ are identical to those for broadcast datagrams (Section 4.3).\n   Namely, if\
    \ the mobile node is using a co-located care-of address (the\n   'D' bit was set\
    \ in the mobile node's Registration Request), then the\n   home agent SHOULD tunnel\
    \ the datagram to this care-of address;\n   otherwise, the home agent MUST first\
    \ encapsulate the datagram in a\n   unicast datagram addressed to the mobile node's\
    \ home address and then\n   MUST tunnel the resulting datagram (nested tunneling)\
    \ to the mobile\n   node's care-of address.  For this reason, the mobile node\
    \ MUST be\n   capable of decapsulating packets sent to its home address in order\
    \ to\n   receive multicast datagrams using this method.\n   A mobile node that\
    \ wishes to send datagrams to a multicast group also\n   has two options:  (1)\
    \ send directly on the visited network; or (2)\n   send via a tunnel to its home\
    \ agent.  Because multicast routing in\n   general depends upon the IP source\
    \ address, a mobile node which sends\n   multicast datagrams directly on the visited\
    \ network MUST use a co-\n   located care-of address as the IP source address.\
    \  Similarly, a\n   mobile node which tunnels a multicast datagram to its home\
    \ agent MUST\n   use its home address as the IP source address of both the (inner)\n\
    \   multicast datagram and the (outer) encapsulating datagram.  This\n   second\
    \ option assumes that the home agent is a multicast router.\n"
- title: 4.5. Mobile Routers
  contents:
  - "4.5. Mobile Routers\n   A mobile node can be a router that is responsible for\
    \ the mobility of\n   one or more entire networks moving together, perhaps on\
    \ an airplane,\n   a ship, a train, an automobile, a bicycle, or a kayak.  The\
    \ nodes\n   connected to a network served by the mobile router may themselves\
    \ be\n   fixed nodes or mobile nodes or routers.  In this document, such\n   networks\
    \ are called \"mobile networks\".\n   A mobile router MAY act as a foreign agent\
    \ and provide a foreign\n   agent care-of address to mobile nodes connected to\
    \ the mobile\n   network.  Typical routing to a mobile node via a mobile router\
    \ in\n   this case is illustrated by the following example:\n      a) A laptop\
    \ computer is disconnected from its home network and\n         later attached\
    \ to a network port in the seat back of an\n         aircraft.  The laptop computer\
    \ uses Mobile IP to register on\n         this foreign network, using a foreign\
    \ agent care-of address\n         discovered through an Agent Advertisement from\
    \ the aircraft's\n         foreign agent.\n      b) The aircraft network is itself\
    \ mobile.  Suppose the node\n         serving as the foreign agent on the aircraft\
    \ also serves as the\n         default router that connects the aircraft network\
    \ to the rest\n         of the Internet.  When the aircraft is at home, this router\
    \ is\n         attached to some fixed network at the airline's headquarters,\n\
    \         which is the router's home network.  While the aircraft is in\n    \
    \     flight, this router registers from time to time over its radio\n       \
    \  link with a series of foreign agents below it on the ground.\n         This\
    \ router's home agent is a node on the fixed network at the\n         airline's\
    \ headquarters.\n      c) Some correspondent node sends a datagram to the laptop\n\
    \         computer, addressing the datagram to the laptop's home address.\n  \
    \       This datagram is initially routed to the laptop's home network.\n    \
    \  d) The laptop's home agent intercepts the datagram on the home\n         network\
    \ and tunnels it to the laptop's care-of address, which\n         in this example\
    \ is an address of the node serving as router and\n         foreign agent on the\
    \ aircraft.  Normal IP routing will route\n         the datagram to the fixed\
    \ network at the airline's\n         headquarters.\n      e) The aircraft router\
    \ and foreign agent's home agent there\n         intercepts the datagram and tunnels\
    \ it to its current care-of\n         address, which in this example is some foreign\
    \ agent on the\n         ground below the aircraft.  The original datagram from\
    \ the\n         correspondent node has now been encapsulated twice:  once by\n\
    \         the laptop's home agent and again by the aircraft's home agent.\n  \
    \    f) The foreign agent on the ground decapsulates the datagram,\n         yielding\
    \ a datagram still encapsulated by the laptop's home\n         agent, with a destination\
    \ address of the laptop's care-of\n         address.  The ground foreign agent\
    \ sends the resulting datagram\n         over its radio link to the aircraft.\n\
    \      g) The foreign agent on the aircraft decapsulates the datagram,\n     \
    \    yielding the original datagram from the correspondent node,\n         with\
    \ a destination address of the laptop's home address.  The\n         aircraft\
    \ foreign agent delivers the datagram over the aircraft\n         network to the\
    \ laptop's link-layer address.\n   This example illustrated the case in which\
    \ a mobile node is attached\n   to a mobile network.  That is, the mobile node\
    \ is mobile with respect\n   to the network, which itself is also mobile (here\
    \ with respect to the\n   ground).  If, instead, the node is fixed with respect\
    \ to the mobile\n   network (the mobile network is the fixed node's home network),\
    \ then\n   either of two methods may be used to cause datagrams from\n   correspondent\
    \ nodes to be routed to the fixed node.\n   A home agent MAY be configured to\
    \ have a permanent registration for\n   the fixed node, that indicates the mobile\
    \ router's address as the\n   fixed host's care-of address.  The mobile router's\
    \ home agent will\n   usually be used for this purpose.  The home agent is then\
    \ responsible\n   for advertising connectivity using normal routing protocols\
    \ to the\n   fixed node.  Any datagrams sent to the fixed node will thus use\n\
    \   nested tunneling as described above.\n   Alternatively, the mobile router\
    \ MAY advertise connectivity to the\n   entire mobile network using normal IP\
    \ routing protocols through a\n   bi-directional tunnel to its own home agent.\
    \  This method avoids the\n   need for nested tunneling of datagrams.\n"
- title: 4.6. ARP, Proxy ARP, and Gratuitous ARP
  contents:
  - "4.6. ARP, Proxy ARP, and Gratuitous ARP\n   The use of ARP [36] requires special\
    \ rules for correct operation when\n   wireless or mobile nodes are involved.\
    \  The requirements specified in\n   this section apply to all home networks in\
    \ which ARP is used for\n   address resolution.\n   In addition to the normal\
    \ use of ARP for resolving a target node's\n   link-layer address from its IP\
    \ address, this document distinguishes\n   two special uses of ARP:\n      - \
    \ A Proxy ARP [39] is an ARP Reply sent by one node on behalf of\n         another\
    \ node which is either unable or unwilling to answer its\n         own ARP Requests.\
    \  The sender of a Proxy ARP reverses the\n         Sender and Target Protocol\
    \ Address fields as described in [36],\n         but supplies some configured\
    \ link-layer address (generally, its\n         own) in the Sender Hardware Address\
    \ field.  The node receiving\n         the Reply will then associate this link-layer\
    \ address with the\n         IP address of the original target node, causing it\
    \ to transmit\n         future datagrams for this target node to the node with\
    \ that\n         link-layer address.\n      -  A Gratuitous ARP [45] is an ARP\
    \ packet sent by a node in order\n         to spontaneously cause other nodes\
    \ to update an entry in their\n         ARP cache.  A gratuitous ARP MAY use either\
    \ an ARP Request or\n         an ARP Reply packet.  In either case, the ARP Sender\
    \ Protocol\n         Address and ARP Target Protocol Address are both set to the\
    \ IP\n         address of the cache entry to be updated, and the ARP Sender\n\
    \         Hardware Address is set to the link-layer address to which this\n  \
    \       cache entry should be updated.  When using an ARP Reply packet,\n    \
    \     the Target Hardware Address is also set to the link-layer\n         address\
    \ to which this cache entry should be updated (this field\n         is not used\
    \ in an ARP Request packet).\n         In either case, for a gratuitous ARP, the\
    \ ARP packet MUST be\n         transmitted as a local broadcast packet on the\
    \ local link.  As\n         specified in [36], any node receiving any ARP packet\
    \ (Request\n         or Reply) MUST update its local ARP cache with the Sender\n\
    \         Protocol and Hardware Addresses in the ARP packet, if the\n        \
    \ receiving node has an entry for that IP address already in its\n         ARP\
    \ cache.  This requirement in the ARP protocol applies even\n         for ARP\
    \ Request packets, and for ARP Reply packets that do not\n         match any ARP\
    \ Request transmitted by the receiving node [36].\n   While a mobile node is registered\
    \ on a foreign network, its home\n   agent uses proxy ARP [39] to reply to ARP\
    \ Requests it receives that\n   seek the mobile node's link-layer address.  When\
    \ receiving an ARP\n   Request, the home agent MUST examine the target IP address\
    \ of the\n   Request, and if this IP address matches the home address of any\n\
    \   mobile node for which it has a registered mobility binding, the home\n   agent\
    \ MUST transmit an ARP Reply on behalf of the mobile node.  After\n   exchanging\
    \ the sender and target addresses in the packet [39], the\n   home agent MUST\
    \ set the sender link-layer address in the packet to\n   the link-layer address\
    \ of its own interface over which the Reply will\n   be sent.\n   When a mobile\
    \ node leaves its home network and registers a binding on\n   a foreign network,\
    \ its home agent uses gratuitous ARP to update the\n   ARP caches of nodes on\
    \ the home network.  This causes such nodes to\n   associate the link-layer address\
    \ of the home agent with the mobile\n   node's home (IP) address.  When registering\
    \ a binding for a mobile\n   node for which the home agent previously had no binding\
    \ (the mobile\n   node was assumed to be at home), the home agent MUST transmit\
    \ a\n   gratuitous ARP on behalf of the mobile node.  This gratuitous ARP\n  \
    \ packet MUST be transmitted as a broadcast packet on the link on which\n   the\
    \ mobile node's home address is located.  Since broadcasts on the\n   local link\
    \ (such as Ethernet) are typically not guaranteed to be\n   reliable, the gratuitous\
    \ ARP packet SHOULD be retransmitted a small\n   number of times to increase its\
    \ reliability.\n   When a mobile node returns to its home network, the mobile\
    \ node and\n   its home agent use gratuitous ARP to cause all nodes on the mobile\n\
    \   node's home network to update their ARP caches to once again\n   associate\
    \ the mobile node's own link-layer address with the mobile\n   node's home (IP)\
    \ address.  Before transmitting the (de)Registration\n   Request message to its\
    \ home agent, the mobile node MUST transmit this\n   gratuitous ARP on its home\
    \ network as a local broadcast on this link.\n   The gratuitous ARP packet SHOULD\
    \ be retransmitted a small number of\n   times to increase its reliability, but\
    \ these retransmissions SHOULD\n   proceed in parallel with the transmission and\
    \ processing of its\n   (de)Registration Request.\n   When the mobile node's home\
    \ agent receives and accepts this\n   (de)Registration Request, the home agent\
    \ MUST also transmit a\n   gratuitous ARP on the mobile node's home network. \
    \ This gratuitous\n   ARP also is used to associate the mobile node's home address\
    \ with the\n   mobile node's own link-layer address.  A gratuitous ARP is\n  \
    \ transmitted by both the mobile node and its home agent, since in the\n   case\
    \ of wireless network interfaces, the area within transmission\n   range of the\
    \ mobile node will likely differ from that within range of\n   its home agent.\
    \  The ARP packet from the home agent MUST be\n   transmitted as a local broadcast\
    \ on the mobile node's home link, and\n   SHOULD be retransmitted a small number\
    \ of times to increase its\n   reliability; these retransmissions, however, SHOULD\
    \ proceed in\n   parallel with the transmission and processing of its (de)Registration\n\
    \   Reply.\n   While the mobile node is away from home, it MUST NOT transmit any\n\
    \   broadcast ARP Request or ARP Reply messages.  Finally, while the\n   mobile\
    \ node is away from home, it MUST NOT reply to ARP Requests in\n   which the target\
    \ IP address is its own home address, unless the ARP\n   Request is unicast by\
    \ a foreign agent with which the mobile node is\n   attempting to register or\
    \ a foreign agent with which the mobile node\n   has an unexpired registration.\
    \  In the latter case, the mobile node\n   MUST use a unicast ARP Reply to respond\
    \ to the foreign agent.  Note\n   that if the mobile node is using a co-located\
    \ care-of address and\n   receives an ARP Request in which the target IP address\
    \ is this care-\n   of address, then the mobile node SHOULD reply to this ARP\
    \ Request.\n   Note also that, when transmitting a Registration Request on a foreign\n\
    \   network, a mobile node may discover the link-layer address of a\n   foreign\
    \ agent by storing the address as it is received from the Agent\n   Advertisement\
    \ from that foreign agent, but not by transmitting a\n   broadcast ARP Request\
    \ message.\n   The specific order in which each of the above requirements for\
    \ the\n   use of ARP, proxy ARP, and gratuitous ARP are applied, relative to\n\
    \   the transmission and processing of the mobile node's Registration\n   Request\
    \ and Registration Reply messages when leaving home or\n   returning home, are\
    \ important to the correct operation of the\n   protocol.\n   To summarize the\
    \ above requirements, when a mobile node leaves its\n   home network, the following\
    \ steps, in this order, MUST be performed:\n      -  The mobile node decides to\
    \ register away from home, perhaps\n         because it has received an Agent\
    \ Advertisement from a foreign\n         agent and has not recently received one\
    \ from its home agent.\n      -  Before transmitting the Registration Request,\
    \ the mobile node\n         disables its own future processing of any ARP Requests\
    \ it may\n         subsequently receive requesting the link-layer address\n  \
    \       corresponding to its home address, except insofar as necessary\n     \
    \    to communicate with foreign agents on visited networks.\n      -  The mobile\
    \ node transmits its Registration Request.\n      -  When the mobile node's home\
    \ agent receives and accepts the\n         Registration Request, it performs a\
    \ gratuitous ARP on behalf of\n         the mobile node, and begins using proxy\
    \ ARP to reply to ARP\n         Requests that it receives requesting the mobile\
    \ node's link-\n         layer address.  In the gratuitous ARP, the ARP Sender\
    \ Hardware\n         Address is set to the link-layer address of the home agent.\n\
    \         If, instead, the home agent rejects the Registration Request,\n    \
    \     no ARP processing (gratuitous nor proxy) is performed by the\n         home\
    \ agent.\n   When a mobile node later returns to its home network, the following\n\
    \   steps, in this order, MUST be performed:\n      -  The mobile node decides\
    \ to register at home, perhaps because it\n         has received an Agent Advertisement\
    \ from its home agent.\n      -  Before transmitting the Registration Request,\
    \ the mobile node\n         re-enables its own future processing of any ARP Requests\
    \ it may\n         subsequently receive requesting its link-layer address.\n \
    \     -  The mobile node performs a gratuitous ARP for itself.  In this\n    \
    \     gratuitous ARP, the ARP Sender Hardware Address is set to the\n        \
    \ link-layer address of the mobile node.\n      -  The mobile node transmits its\
    \ Registration Request.\n      -  When the mobile node's home agent receives and\
    \ accepts the\n         Registration Request, it stops using proxy ARP to reply\
    \ to ARP\n         Requests that it receives requesting the mobile node's link-\n\
    \         layer address, and then performs a gratuitous ARP on behalf of\n   \
    \      the mobile node.  In this gratuitous ARP, the ARP Sender\n         Hardware\
    \ Address is set to the link-layer address of the mobile\n         node.  If,\
    \ instead, the home agent rejects the Registration\n         Request, the home\
    \ agent MUST NOT make any change to the way it\n         performs ARP processing\
    \ (gratuitous nor proxy) for the mobile\n         node.  In this latter case,\
    \ the home agent should operate as if\n         the mobile node has not returned\
    \ home, and continue to perform\n         proxy ARP on behalf of the mobile node.\n"

- title: 5.7.1. Replay Protection using Timestamps
  contents:
  - "5.7.1. Replay Protection using Timestamps\n   The basic principle of timestamp\
    \ replay protection is that the node\n   generating a message inserts the current\
    \ time of day, and the node\n   receiving the message checks that this timestamp\
    \ is sufficiently\n   close to its own time of day.  Unless specified differently\
    \ in the\n   security association between the nodes, a default value of 7 seconds\n\
    \   MAY be used to limit the time difference.  This value SHOULD be\n   greater\
    \ than 3 seconds.  Obviously the two nodes must have adequately\n   synchronized\
    \ time-of-day clocks.  As with any messages, time\n   synchronization messages\
    \ may be protected against tampering by an\n   authentication mechanism determined\
    \ by the security context between\n   the two nodes.\n   If timestamps are used,\
    \ the mobile node MUST set the Identification\n   field to a 64-bit value formatted\
    \ as specified by the Network Time\n   Protocol [26].  The low-order 32 bits of\
    \ the NTP format represent\n   fractional seconds, and those bits which are not\
    \ available from a\n   time source SHOULD be generated from a good source of randomness.\n\
    \   Note, however, that when using timestamps, the 64-bit Identification\n   used\
    \ in a Registration Request from the mobile node MUST be greater\n   than that\
    \ used in any previous Registration Request, as the home\n   agent uses this field\
    \ also as a sequence number.  Without such a\n   sequence number, it would be\
    \ possible for a delayed duplicate of an\n   earlier Registration Request to arrive\
    \ at the home agent (within the\n   clock synchronization required by the home\
    \ agent), and thus be\n   applied out of order, mistakenly altering the mobile\
    \ node's current\n   registered care-of address.\n   Upon receipt of a Registration\
    \ Request with an authorization-enabling\n   extension, the home agent MUST check\
    \ the Identification field for\n   validity.  In order to be valid, the timestamp\
    \ contained in the\n   Identification field MUST be close enough to the home agent's\
    \ time of\n   day clock and the timestamp MUST be greater than all previously\n\
    \   accepted timestamps for the requesting mobile node.  Time tolerances\n   and\
    \ resynchronization details are specific to a particular mobility\n   security\
    \ association.\n   If the timestamp is valid, the home agent copies the entire\n\
    \   Identification field into the Registration Reply it returns the Reply\n  \
    \ to the mobile node.  If the timestamp is not valid, the home agent\n   copies\
    \ only the low-order 32 bits into the Registration Reply, and\n   supplies the\
    \ high-order 32 bits from its own time of day.  In this\n   latter case, the home\
    \ agent MUST reject the registration by returning\n   Code 133 (identification\
    \ mismatch) in the Registration Reply.\n   As described in Section 3.6.2.1, the\
    \ mobile node MUST verify that the\n   low-order 32 bits of the Identification\
    \ in the Registration Reply are\n   identical to those in the rejected registration\
    \ attempt, before using\n   the high-order bits for clock resynchronization.\n"

    \ to node A.\n   Both messages use an authentication code to protect against\n\
    \   alteration by an attacker.  At the same time node B can send its own\n   nonces\
    \ in all messages to node A (to be echoed by node A), so that it\n   too can verify\
    \ that it is receiving fresh messages.\n   The home agent may be expected to have\
    \ resources for computing\n   pseudo-random numbers useful as nonces [14].  It\
    \ inserts a new nonce\n   as the high-order 32 bits of the identification field\
    \ of every\n   Registration Reply.  The home agent copies the low-order 32 bits\
    \ of\n   the Identification from the Registration Request message into the\n \
    \  low-order 32 bits of the Identification in the Registration Reply.\n   When\
    \ the mobile node receives an authenticated Registration Reply\n   from the home\
    \ agent, it saves the high-order 32 bits of the\n   identification for use as\
    \ the high-order 32 bits of its next\n   Registration Request.\n   The mobile\
    \ node is responsible for generating the low-order 32 bits\n   of the Identification\
    \ in each Registration Request.  Ideally it\n   should generate its own random\
    \ nonces.  However it may use any\n   expedient method, including duplication\
    \ of the random value sent by\n   the home agent.  The method chosen is of concern\
    \ only to the mobile\n   node, because it is the node that checks for valid values\
    \ in the\n   Registration Reply.  The high-order and low-order 32 bits of the\n\
    \   identification chosen SHOULD both differ from their previous values.\n   The\
    \ home agent uses a new high-order value and the mobile node uses a\n   new low-order\
    \ value for each registration message.  The foreign agent\n   uses the low-order\
    \ value (and the mobile host's home address) to\n   correctly match registration\
    \ replies with pending Requests (Section\n   3.7.1).\n   If a registration message\
    \ is rejected because of an invalid nonce,\n   the Reply always provides the mobile\
    \ node with a new nonce to be used\n   in the next registration.  Thus the nonce\
    \ protocol is self-\n   synchronizing.\n"

  contents:
  - "C.1. TCP Timers\n   When high-delay (e.g. SATCOM) or low-bandwidth (e.g. High-Frequency\n\
    \   Radio) links are in use, some TCP stacks may have insufficiently\n   adaptive\
    \ (non-standard) retransmission timeouts.  There may be\n   spurious retransmission\
    \ timeouts, even when the link and network\n   are actually operating properly,\
    \ but just with a high delay because\n   of the medium in use.  This can cause\
    \ an inability to create or\n   maintain TCP connections over such links, and\
    \ can also cause unneeded\n   retransmissions which consume already scarce bandwidth.\
    \  Vendors\n   are encouraged to follow the algorithms in RFC 2988 [31] when\n\
    \   implementing TCP retransmission timers.  Vendors of systems designed\n   for\
    \ low-bandwidth, high-delay links should consult RFCs 2757 and\n   2488 [28, 1].\

- title: C.2. TCP Congestion Management
  contents:
  - "C.2. TCP Congestion Management\n   Mobile nodes often use media which are more\
    \ likely to introduce\n   errors, effectively causing more packets to be dropped.\
    \  This\n   introduces a conflict with the mechanisms for congestion management\n\
    \   found in modern versions of TCP [21].  Now, when a packet is dropped,\n  \
    \ the correspondent node's TCP implementation is likely to react as\n   if there\
    \ were a source of network congestion, and initiate the\n   slow-start mechanisms\
    \ [21] designed for controlling that problem.\n   However, those mechanisms are\
    \ inappropriate for overcoming errors\n   introduced by the links themselves,\
    \ and have the effect of magnifying\n   the discontinuity introduced by the dropped\
    \ packet.  This problem has\n   been analyzed by Caceres, et al. [5].  TCP approaches\
    \ to the problem\n   of handling errors that might interfere with congestion management\n\
    \   are discussed in documents from the [pilc] working group [3, 9].\n   While\
    \ such approaches are beyond the scope of this document,\n   they illustrate that\
    \ providing performance transparency to mobile\n   nodes involves understanding\
    \ mechanisms outside the network layer.\n   Problems introduced by higher media\
    \ error rates also indicate the\n   need to avoid designs which systematically\
    \ drop packets; such designs\n   might otherwise be considered favorably when\
    \ making engineering\n   tradeoffs.\n"

    \ that two foreign\n   agents advertising the same prefix might indeed provide\

    \ a zero home address and expect to receive\n         their home address in the\
    \ Registration Reply would not work\n         with old mobility agents.\n    \
    \  -  Mobile nodes that attempt to authenticate themselves without\n         using\
    \ the Mobile-Home authentication extension will be unable\n         to successful\
    \ register with their home agent.\n   In all of these cases, a robust and well-configured\
    \ mobile node is\n   very likely to be able to recover if it takes reasonable\
    \ actions upon\n   receipt of a Registration Reply with an error code indicating\
    \ the\n   cause for rejection.  For instance, if a mobile node sends a\n   registration\
    \ request that is rejected because it contains the wrong\n   kind of authentication\
    \ extension, then the mobile node could retry\n   the registration with a mobile-home\
    \ authentication extension, since\n   the foreign agent and/or home agent in this\
    \ case will not be\n   configured to demand the alternative authentication data.\n"

  - "G.1. Major Changes\n      -  Specification for Destination IP address of Registration\
    \ Reply\n         transmitted from Foreign Agent, to avoid any possible\n    \
    \     transmission to IP address 0.0.0.0.\n      -  Specification of two new formats\
    \ for Mobile IP extensions,\n         according to the ideas contained in MIER.\n\
    \      -  Specification that the SPI of the MN-HA authentication\n         extension\
    \ is to be used as part of the data over which the\n         authentication algorithm\
    \ must be computed.\n      -  Eliminated Van-Jacobson Compression feature\n  \
    \    -  Specification that foreign agents MAY send advertisements at a\n     \
    \    rate faster than once per second, but chosen so that the\n         advertisements\
    \ do not burden the capacity of the local link.\n         For simplicity, the\
    \ foreign agent now MAY send advertisements\n         at an interval less than\
    \ 1/3 the advertised ICMP Lifetime.\n      -  Specification that foreign agents\
    \ SHOULD support reverse\n         tunneling, and home agents MUST support decapsulation\
    \ of\n         reverse tunnels.\n      -  Changed the preconfiguration requirements\
    \ in section 3.6 for\n         the mobile node to reflect the capability, specified\
    \ in RFC\n         2794 [6], for the mobile node to identify itself by using its\n\
    \         NAI, and then getting a home address from the Registration\n       \
    \  Reply.\n      -  Changed section 3.7.3.1 so that a foreign agent is not required\n\
    \         to discard Registration Replies that have a Home Address field\n   \
    \      that does not match any pending Registration Request.\n      -  Allowed\
    \ registrations to be authenticated by use of a security\n         association\
    \ between the mobile node and a suitable\n         authentication entity acceptable\
    \ to the home agent.  Defined\n         \"Authorization-enabling Extension\" to\
    \ be an authentication\n         extension that makes a registration message acceptable\
    \ to the\n         recipient.  This is needed according to specification in [6].\n\
    \      -  Mandated that HMAC-MD5 be used instead of the \"prefix+suffix\"\n  \
    \       mode of MD5 as originally mandated in RFC 2002.\n      -  Specified that\
    \ the mobile node SHOULD take the first care-of\n         address in a list offered\
    \ by a foreign agent, and MAY try each\n         subsequent advertised address\
    \ in turn if the attempted\n         registrations are rejected by the foreign\
    \ agent\n      -  Clarification that a mobility agent SHOULD only put its own\n\
    \         addresses into the initial (i.e., not mobility-related) list of\n  \
    \       routers in the mobility advertisement.  RFC 2002 suggests that\n     \
    \    a mobility agent might advertise other default routers.\n      -  Specification\
    \ that a mobile node MUST ignore reserved bits in\n         Agent Advertisements,\
    \ as opposed to discarding such\n         advertisements.  In this way, new bits\
    \ can be defined later,\n         without affecting the ability for mobile nodes\
    \ to use the\n         advertisements even when the newly defined bits are not\n\
    \         understood.  Furthermore, foreign agents can set the `R' bit to\n  \
    \       make sure that new bits are handled by themselves instead of\n       \
    \  some legacy mobility agent.\n      -  Specification that the foreign agent\
    \ checks to make sure that\n         the indicated home agent address does not\
    \ belong to any of its\n         network interfaces before relaying a Registration\
    \ Request.  If\n         the check fails, and the foreign agent is not the mobile\
    \ node's\n         home agent, then the foreign agent rejects the request with\n\
    \         code 136 (unknown home agent address).\n      -  Specification that,\
    \ while they are away from the home network,\n         mobile nodes MUST NOT broadcast\
    \ ARP packets to find the MAC\n         address of another Internet node.  Thus,\
    \ the (possibly empty)\n         list of Router Addresses from the ICMP Router\
    \ Advertisement\n         portion of the message is not useful for selecting a\
    \ default\n         router, unless the mobile node has some means not involving\n\
    \         broadcast ARP and not specified within this document for\n         obtaining\
    \ the MAC address of one of the routers in the list.\n         Similarly, in the\
    \ absence of unspecified mechanisms for\n         obtaining MAC addresses on foreign\
    \ networks, the mobile node\n         MUST ignore redirects to other routers on\
    \ foreign networks.\n      -  Specification that a foreign agent MUST NOT use\
    \ broadcast ARP\n         for a mobile node's MAC address on a foreign network.\
    \  It may\n         obtain the MAC address by copying the information from an\
    \ Agent\n         Solicitation or a Registration Request transmitted from a\n\
    \         mobile node.\n      -  Specification that a foreign agent's ARP cache\
    \ for the mobile\n         node's IP address MUST NOT be allowed to expire before\
    \ the\n         mobile node's visitor list entry expires, unless the foreign\n\
    \         agent has some way other than broadcast ARP to refresh its MAC\n   \
    \      address associated to the mobile node's IP address.\n      -  At the end\
    \ of section 4.6, clarified that a home agent MUST NOT\n         make any changes\
    \ to the way it performs proxy ARP after it\n         rejects an invalid deregistration\
    \ request.\n      -  In section 4.2.3, specification that multihomed home agents\n\
    \         MUST use the the address sent to the mobile node in the home\n     \
    \    agent field of the registration reply as the source address in\n        \
    \ the outer IP header of the encapsulated datagram.\n      -  Inserted 'T' bit\
    \ into its proper place in the Registration\n         Request message format (section\
    \ 3.3).\n"

  - "G.2. Minor Changes\n      -  Allowed registration replies to be processed by\
    \ the mobile\n         node, even in the absence of any Mobile-Home Authentication\n\
    \         extension, when containing rejection code by the foreign agent.\n  \
    \    -  Specification that the foreign agent MAY configure a maximum\n       \
    \  number of pending registrations that it is willing to maintain\n         (typically\
    \ 5).  Additional registrations SHOULD then be\n         rejected by the foreign\
    \ agent with code 66.  The foreign agent\n         MAY delete any pending Registration\

    \ in this case, the\n         foreign agent SHOULD reject the Request with code\
    \ 78\n         (registration timeout).\n      -  Relaxation of the requirement\
    \ that, when a mobile node has\n         joined a multicast group at the router\

    \ 'H', and 'F' bits on different network\n         interfaces.\n      -  Replacement\
    \ of the terminology \"recursive tunneling\" by the\n         terminology \"nested\
    \ tunneling\".\n      -  Specification that the mobile node MAY use the IP source\n\
    \         address of an agent advertisement as its default router\n         address.\n\
    \      -  Clarification that keys with arbitrary binary values MUST be\n     \
    \    supported as part of mobility security associations.\n      -  Specification\
    \ that the default value may be chosen as 7\n         seconds, for allowable time\
    \ skews between a home agent and\n         mobile node using timestamps for replay\
    \ protection.  Further\n         specification that this value SHOULD be greater\
    \ than 3 seconds.\n      -  Specification that Registration Requests with the\
    \ 'D' bit set\n         to 0, and specifying a care-of address not offered by\
    \ the\n         foreign agent, MUST be rejected with code 77 (invalid care-of\n\
    \         address).\n      -  Clarification that the foreign agent SHOULD consider\
    \ its own\n         maximum value when handling the Lifetime field of the\n  \
    \       Registration Reply.\n      -  Clarification that the home agent MUST ignore\
    \ the 'B' bit (as\n         opposed to rejecting the Registration Request) if\
    \ it does not\n         support broadcasts.\n      -  Advice about the impossibility\
    \ of using dynamic home agent\n         discovery in the case when routers change\
    \ the IP destination\n         address of a datagram from a subnet-directed broadcast\
    \ address\n         to 255.255.255.255 before injecting it into the destination\n\
    \         subnet.\n      -  Clarified that when an Agent Advertisement is unicast\
    \ to a\n         mobile node, the specific IP home address of a mobile node MAY\n\
    \         be used as the destination IP address.\n      -  Included a reference\
