- title: 1.1.  Basic Concepts
  contents:
  - "1.1.  Basic Concepts\n   \"Netnews\" is a set of protocols for generating, storing,\
    \ and\n   retrieving news \"articles\" (whose format is a subset of that for\n\
    \   Email messages), and for exchanging them amongst a readership that is\n  \
    \ potentially widely distributed.  It is organized around \"newsgroups\",\n  \
    \ with the expectation that each reader will be able to see all\n   articles posted\
    \ to each newsgroup in which he participates.  These\n   protocols most commonly\
    \ use a flooding algorithm, which propagates\n   copies throughout a network of\
    \ participating servers.  Typically,\n   only one copy is stored per server, and\
    \ each server makes it\n   available on demand to readers who are able to access\
    \ that server.\n"

    \ context\n   of the Internet Message Format [RFC5322] and Multipurpose Internet\n\
    \   Mail Extensions (MIME) [RFC2045].  This document obsoletes [RFC1036],\n  \
    \ updating the syntax of Netnews articles to reflect current practice\n   and\
    \ incorporating changes and clarifications specified in other\n   documents such\
    \ as [Son-of-1036].\n   This is the first in a set of documents that obsolete\
    \ [RFC1036].\n   This document focuses on the syntax and semantics of Netnews\n\
    \   articles.  [RFC5537] is also a Standards Track document and describes\n  \
    \ the protocol issues of Netnews articles, independent of transport\n   protocols\
    \ such as the Network News Transfer Protocol (NNTP)\n   [RFC3977].  [USEAGE],\
    \ \"Usenet Best Practice\", describes\n   implementation recommendations to improve\
    \ interoperability and\n   usability.\n   This specification is intended as a\
    \ definition of what article\n   content format is to be passed between systems.\
    \  Although many news\n   systems locally store articles in this format (which\
    \ eliminates the\n   need for translation between formats), local storage is outside\
    \ of\n   the scope of this standard.\n"

- title: 1.5.  Definitions
  contents:
  - "1.5.  Definitions\n   An \"article\" is the unit of Netnews, analogous to an\
    \ [RFC5322]\n   \"message\".  A \"proto-article\" is one that has not yet been\
    \ injected\n   into the news system.  In contrast to an article, a proto-article\
    \ may\n   lack some mandatory header fields.\n   A \"message identifier\" (Section\
    \ 3.1.3) is a unique identifier for an\n   article, usually supplied by the user\
    \ agent that posted it or,\n   failing that, by the \"news server\".  It distinguishes\
    \ the article\n   from every other article ever posted anywhere.  Articles with\
    \ the\n   same message identifier are treated as if they are the same article\n\
    \   regardless of any differences in the body or header fields.\n   A \"newsgroup\"\
    \ is a forum having a name and that is intended for\n   articles on a specific\
    \ topic.  An article is \"posted to\" a single\n   newsgroup or several newsgroups.\
    \  When an article is posted to more\n   than one newsgroup, it is said to be\
    \ \"crossposted\"; note that this\n   differs from posting the same text as part\
    \ of each of several\n   articles, one per newsgroup.\n   A newsgroup may be \"\
    moderated\", in which case submissions are not\n   posted directly, but mailed\
    \ to a \"moderator\" for consideration and\n   possible posting.  Moderators are\
    \ typically human but may be\n   implemented partially or entirely in software.\n\
    \   A \"poster\" is the person or software that composes and submits a\n   potentially\
    \ compliant article to a user agent.\n   A \"reader\" is the person or software\
    \ reading Netnews articles.\n   A \"followup\" is an article containing a response\
    \ to the contents of\n   an earlier article, its \"precursor\".  Every followup\
    \ includes a\n   \"References\" header field identifying that precursor (but note\
    \ that\n   non-followup articles may also use a References header field).\n  \
    \ A \"control message\" is an article that is marked as containing\n   control\
    \ information; a news server receiving such an article may\n   (subject to the\
    \ policies observed at that site) take actions beyond\n   just filing and passing\
    \ on the article.\n   A news server is software that may accept articles from\
    \ a user agent,\n   and/or make articles available to user agents, and/or exchange\n\
    \   articles with other news servers.\n   A \"user agent\" is software that may\
    \ help posters submit proto-\n   articles to a news server, and/or fetch articles\
    \ from a news server\n   and present them to a reader, and/or assist the reader\
    \ in creating\n   articles and followups.\n   The generic term \"agent\" is used\
    \ when describing requirements that\n   apply to both user agents and news servers.\n\
    \   An agent is said to \"generate\" a construct if it did not exist before\n\
    \   the agent created it.  Examples are when a user agent creates a\n   message\
    \ from text and addressing information supplied by a user, or\n   when a news\
    \ server creates an \"Injection-Info\" header field for a\n   newly posted message.\n\
    \   An agent is said to \"accept\" a construct if some other entity\n   generates\
    \ it and passes it to the agent in question, and the agent\n   processes it without\
    \ treating it as a format or protocol error.\n"

  - "1.6.  Structure of This Document\n   This document uses a cite-by-reference methodology,\

    \ this document is as a result rather short, it requires\n   complete understanding\
    \ and implementation of the normative references\n   to be compliant.\n   Section\

    \ fields necessary to make an article suitable for the\n   Netnews environment.\n"

- title: 2.1.  Base
  contents:
  - "2.1.  Base\n   An article is said to be conformant to this specification if it\n\
    \   conforms to the format specified in Section 3 of [RFC5322] and to the\n  \
    \ additional requirements of this specification.\n   An article that uses the\
    \ obsolete syntax specified in Section 4 of\n   [RFC5322] is NOT conformant to\
    \ this specification, except for the\n   following two cases:\n   o  Articles\
    \ are conformant if they use the <obs-phrase> construct\n      (use of a phrase\
    \ like \"John Q. Public\" without the use of quotes,\n      see Section 4.1 of\
    \ [RFC5322]), but agents MUST NOT generate\n      productions of such syntax.\n\
    \   o  Articles are conformant if they use the \"GMT\" <zone>, as specified\n\
    \      in Section 3.1.1.\n   This document, and specifications that build upon\
    \ it, specify how to\n   handle conformant articles.  Handling of non-conformant\
    \ articles is\n   outside the scope of this specification.\n   Agents conforming\
    \ to this specification MUST generate only conformant\n   articles.\n   The text\
    \ below uses ABNF to specify restrictions on the syntax\n   specified in [RFC5322];\
    \ this grammar is intended to be more\n   restrictive than the [RFC5322] grammar.\
    \  Articles must conform to the\n   ABNF specified in [RFC5322] and also to the\
    \ restrictions specified\n   here, both those that are expressed as text and those\
    \ that are\n   expressed as ABNF.\n      NOTE: Other specifications use the term\
    \ \"header\" as a synonym for\n      what [RFC5322] calls \"header field\".  This\
    \ document follows the\n      terminology in Section 2 of [RFC5322] in using the\
    \ terms \"line\",\n      \"header field\", \"header field name\", \"header field\
    \ body\", and\n      \"folding\", based on a belief that consistent terminology\
    \ among\n      specifications that depend on each other makes the specifications\n\
    \      easier to use in the long run.\n"
- title: 2.2.  Header Fields
  contents:
  - "2.2.  Header Fields\n   All header fields in a Netnews article are compliant\
    \ with [RFC5322];\n   this specification, however, is less permissive in what\
    \ can be\n   generated and accepted by agents.  The syntax allowed for Netnews\n\
    \   article headers is a strict subset of the Internet Message Format\n   headers,\
    \ making all headers compliant with this specification\n   inherently compliant\
    \ with [RFC5322].  Note however that the converse\n   is not guaranteed to be\
    \ true in all cases.\n   General rules that apply to all header fields (even those\
    \ documented\n   in [RFC5322] and [RFC2045]) are listed below, and those that\
    \ apply to\n   specific header fields are described in the relevant sections of\
    \ this\n   document.\n   o  All agents MUST generate header fields so that at\
    \ least one space\n      immediately follows the ':' separating the header field\
    \ name and\n      the header field body (for compatibility with deployed software,\n\
    \      including NNTP [RFC3977] servers).  News agents MAY accept header\n   \
    \   fields that do not contain the required space.\n   o  Every line of a header\
    \ field body (including the first and any\n      that are subsequently folded)\
    \ MUST contain at least one non-\n      whitespace character.\n         NOTE:\
    \ This means that no header field body defined by or\n         referenced by this\
    \ document can be empty.  As a result, rather\n         than using the <unstructured>\
    \ syntax from Section 3.2.5 of\n         [RFC5322], this document uses a stricter\
    \ definition:\n   unstructured    =  *WSP VCHAR *( [FWS] VCHAR ) *WSP\n      \
    \   NOTE: The [RFC5322] specification sometimes uses [FWS] at the\n         beginning\
    \ or end of ABNF describing header field content.  This\n         specification\
    \ uses *WSP in such cases, also in cases where this\n         specification redefines\
    \ constructs from [RFC5322].  This is\n         done for consistency with the\
    \ restriction described here, but\n         the restriction applies to all header\
    \ fields, not just those\n         where ABNF is defined in this document.\n \
    \  o  Compliant software MUST NOT generate (but MAY accept) header field\n   \
    \   lines of more than 998 octets.  This is the only limit on the\n      length\
    \ of a header field line prescribed by this standard.\n      However, specific\
    \ rules to the contrary may apply in particular\n      cases (for example, according\
    \ to [RFC2047], lines of a header\n      field containing encoded words are limited\
    \ to 76 octets).\n      [USEAGE] includes suggested limits for convenience of\
    \ display by\n      user agents.\n         NOTE: As stated in [RFC5322], there\
    \ is NO restriction on the\n         number of lines into which a header field\
    \ may be split, and\n         hence there is NO restriction on the total length\
    \ of a header\n         field (in particular it may, by suitable folding, be made\
    \ to\n         exceed the 998-octet restriction pertaining to a single header\n\
    \         field line).\n   o  The character set for header fields is US-ASCII.\
    \  Where the use of\n      non-ASCII characters is required, they MUST be encoded\
    \ using the\n      MIME mechanisms defined in [RFC2047] and [RFC2231].\n"
- title: 2.3.  MIME Conformance
  contents:
  - "2.3.  MIME Conformance\n   User agents MUST meet the definition of MIME conformance\
    \ in [RFC2049]\n   and MUST also support [RFC2231].  This level of MIME conformance\n\
    \   provides support for internationalization and multimedia in message\n   bodies\
    \ [RFC2045], [RFC2046], and [RFC2231], and support for\n   internationalization\
    \ of header fields [RFC2047] and [RFC2231].  Note\n   that [Errata] currently\

    \ of Section 5 of [RFC2047], all header fields defined\n   in Section 3 of this\
    \ standard are to be considered as \"extension\n   message header fields\", permitting\

    \ [RFC3977] might have trouble with the full range of possible\n   <msg-id>s permitted\
    \ by [RFC5322].  This section therefore restricts\n   the syntax of <msg-id> as\
    \ compared to Section 3.6.4 of [RFC5322].\n   The global uniqueness requirement\
    \ for <msg-id> in [RFC5322] is to be\n   understood as applying across all protocols\

    , or \"\\\"\n   The <msg-id> MUST NOT be more than 250 octets in length.\n   \
    \   NOTE: The length restriction ensures that systems that accept\n      message\
    \ identifiers as a parameter when referencing an article\n      (e.g., [RFC3977])\
    \ can rely on a bounded length.\n   Observe that <msg-id> includes the < and >.\n\
    \   Observe also that in contrast to the corresponding header field in\n   [RFC5322]:\n\
    \   o  The syntax does not allow comments within the Message-ID header\n     \
    \ field.\n   o  There is no possibility for \">\" or WSP to occur inside a <msg-id>.\n\
    \   o  Even though commonly derived from <domain>s, <id-rights>s are\n      case-sensitive\
    \ (and thus, once created, are not to be altered\n      during subsequent transmission\
    \ or copying)\n   This is to simplify processing by news servers and to ensure\n\
    \   interoperability with existing implementations and compliance with\n   [RFC3977].\
    \  A simple comparison of octets will always suffice to\n   determine the identity\
    \ of two <msg-id>s.\n   Also note that this updated ABNF applies wherever <msg-id>\
    \ is used,\n   including the References header field discussed in Section 3.2.10\
    \ and\n   the Supersedes header field discussed in Section 3.2.12.\n   Some software\
    \ will try to match the <id-right> of a <msg-id> in a\n   case-insensitive fashion;\
    \ some will match it in a case-sensitive\n   fashion.  Implementations MUST NOT\
    \ generate a Message-ID where the\n   only difference from another Message-ID\
    \ is the case of characters in\n   the <id-right> part.\n   When generating a\
    \ <msg-id>, implementations SHOULD use a domain name\n   as the <id-right>.\n\
    \      NOTE: Section 3.6.4 of [RFC5322] recommends that the <id-right>\n     \
    \ should be a domain name or a domain literal.  Domain literals are\n      troublesome\
    \ since many IP addresses are not globally unique;\n      domain names are more\

    \ CRLF\n      NOTE: The syntax of <parameter> (Section 5.1 of [RFC2045], as\n\
    \      amended by [RFC2231]), taken in conjunction with the folding rules\n  \
    \    of [RFC0822] (note: not [RFC2822] or [RFC5322]), effectively\n      allows\
    \ [CFWS] to occur on either side of the \"=\" inside a\n      <parameter>.\n \

    \ Since any such <host-value> or <address-list> also has to be\n      a syntactically\

    \ throughout\n   the Injection-Info header field, folding SHOULD NOT be used within\n\
    \   any <parameter>.  Folding SHOULD only occur before or after the \";\"\n  \
    \ separating <parameter>s, and comments SHOULD only be used following\n   the\
    \ last <parameter>.\n      NOTE: Some of this information has previously been\
    \ sent in non-\n      standardized header fields such as NNTP-Posting-Host, X-Trace,\n\
    \      X-Complaints-To, and others.  Once a news server generates an\n      Injection-Info\
    \ header field, it should have no need to send these\n      non-standard header\
    \ fields.\n   The \"posting-host\" <parameter> specifies the Fully Qualified Domain\n\
    \   Name (FQDN) and/or IP address (IPv4address or IPv6address) of the\n   host\
    \ from which the news server received the article.\n      NOTE: If the \"posting-host\"\
    \ <parameter> fails to deterministically\n      identify the host (e.g., dynamic\
    \ IP address allocation), the\n      \"posting-account\" or \"logging-data\" <parameter>\
    \ may provide\n      additional information about the true origin of the article.\n\
    \   The \"posting-account\" <parameter> identifies the source from which\n   that\
    \ news server received the article, in a notation that can be\n   interpreted\
    \ by the news server administrator.  This notation can\n   include any information\
    \ the administrator deems pertinent.  In order\n   to limit the exposure of personal\
    \ data, it SHOULD be given in a form\n   that cannot be interpreted by other sites.\
    \  However, to make it\n   useful for rate limiting and abuse detection, two messages\
    \ posted\n   from the same source SHOULD have the same value of \"posting-account\"\
    ,\n   and two messages from different sources SHOULD have differing values\n \
    \  of \"posting-account\".  The exact definition of \"source\" is left to\n  \
    \ the discretion of the news server administrator.\n   The \"logging-data\" <parameter>\
    \ contains information (typically a\n   session number or other non-persistent\
    \ means of identifying a posting\n   account) that will enable the true origin\
    \ of the article to be\n   determined by reference to logging information kept\
    \ by the news\n   server.\n   The \"mail-complaints-to\" <parameter> specifies\
    \ one or more mailboxes\n   for sending complaints concerning the behavior of\
    \ the poster of the\n   article.\n   It is a matter of local policy which of the\
    \ above <parameter>s to\n   include.  Some pieces of information have privacy\
    \ implications; this\n   is discussed in [USEAGE].\n"

    \   authentication of sender, or non-repudiation.  Instead, such services\n  \
    \ need to be layered above, using such protocols as S/MIME [RFC3851] or\n   PGP/MIME\
    \ (Pretty Good Privacy / MIME) [RFC3156], or below, using\n   secure versions\
    \ of news transport protocols.  Additionally, several\n   currently non-standardized\
    \ protocols such as [PGPVERIFY] may be\n   standardized in the near future.\n\
    \   Message identifiers (Section 3.1.3) in Netnews articles are required\n   to\
    \ be unique; articles may be refused (in server-to-server transfer)\n   if the\
    \ identifier has already been seen.  If a malicious agent can\n   predict the\
    \ identifier of an article, it can preempt the article by\n   posting its own\
    \ article (possibly to a quite different group) with\n   the same message identifier,\
    \ thereby preventing the target article\n   from propagating.  Therefore, agents\
    \ that generate message\n   identifiers for Netnews articles SHOULD ensure that\
    \ they are\n   unpredictable.\n   MIME security considerations are discussed in\
    \ [RFC2046].  Note that\n   the full range of encodings allowed for parameters\
    \ in [RFC2046] and\n   [RFC2231] permits constructs that simple parsers may fail\

    \ multipart/mixed\n     (; boundary=foo ; xyz=\");bOuNdArY*=''next%20part(\")\n\
    \   Content-Type: multipart/digest;\n     boundary (not=me) = (\"yes ;-) simple\
    \ (foo;bar\") ; x-foo = xyzzy\n   Such deficiencies in parsing may be used as\

  - "Appendix B.  Differences from RFC 1036 and Its Derivatives\n   This appendix\
    \ contains a list of changes that have been made in the\n   Netnews article format\
    \ from earlier standards, specifically\n   [RFC1036].\n   o  The [RFC5322] conventions\
    \ for parenthesis-enclosed <comment>s in\n      header fields are supported in\
    \ all newly defined header fields and\n      in header fields inherited from [RFC5322].\
    \  They are, however,\n      still disallowed for performance and/or compatibility\
    \ reasons in\n      the Control, Distribution, Followup-To, Lines, Message-ID,\n\
    \      Newsgroups, Path, Supersedes, and Xref header fields.\n   o  Multiple addresses\
    \ are allowed in the From header field.\n   o  [FWS] is permitted in Newsgroups\
    \ header fields.\n   o  An enhanced syntax for the Path header field enables the\
    \ injection\n      point of, and the route taken by, an article to be determined\
    \ with\n      more precision.\n   o  Only one (1) message identifier is allowed\
    \ in the Supersedes\n      header field.\n   o  MIME is recognized as an integral\
    \ part of Netnews.\n   o  There is a new Injection-Date header field to make the\
    \ rejection\n      of stale articles more precise and to minimize spurious\n \
    \     rejections.\n   o  There are several new optional header fields defined,\
    \ notably\n      Archive, Injection-Info, and User-Agent, leading to increased\n\
    \      functionality.\n   o  Certain header fields, notably Lines, have been deprecated\
    \ or made\n      obsolete (Section 3.3).\n   o  The convention to interpret subjects\
    \ starting with the word \"cmsg\"\n      as a control message was removed.\n \
    \  o  There are numerous other small changes, clarifications, and\n      enhancements.\n"
- title: Appendix C.  Differences from RFC 5322
  contents:
  - "Appendix C.  Differences from RFC 5322\n   This appendix lists the differences\
    \ between the syntax allowed by the\n   Netnews article format (this document)\
    \ as compared to the Internet\n   Message Format, as specified in [RFC5322].\n\
    \   The Netnews article format is a strict subset of the Internet Message\n  \
    \ Format; all Netnews articles conform to the syntax of [RFC5322].\n   The following\
    \ restrictions are important:\n   o  A SP (space) is REQUIRED after the colon\
    \ (':') following a header\n      field name.\n   o  A slightly restricted syntax\
    \ of <msg-id> (to be used by the\n      Message-ID, References, and Supersedes\
    \ header fields) is defined.\n   o  The length of a <msg-id> MUST NOT exceed 250\
    \ octets.\n   o  Comments are not allowed in the Message-ID header field.\n  \
    \ o  The CFWS between <msg-id>s in the References header field is not\n      optional.\n\
    \   o  It is legal for a parser to reject obsolete syntax, except that:\n    \
    \  *  The <obs-phrase> construct MUST be accepted.\n      *  The obsolete <zone>\
    \ \"GMT\" MUST be accepted within a\n         <date-time>.\n   o  Every line of\
    \ a header field body (including the first and any\n      that are subsequently\
    \ folded) MUST contain at least one non-\n      whitespace character.  This means\
    \ that an empty header field body\n      is illegal.\n"
