- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   [RFC5280] defines the AKI (Authority Key Identifier) and\
    \ SKI (Subject\n   Key Identifier) certificate extensions.  [RFC5280] describes\
    \ two\n   example mechanisms for generating AKI and SKI values: a 160-bit SHA-1\n\
    \   (Secure Hash Algorithm) hash of the public key and a four-bit type\n   field\
    \ with the value 0100 followed by the least significant 60 bits\n   of the SHA-1\
    \ hash.  Both of these mechanisms were designed to not be\n   critical to security.\
    \  This document defines three additional\n   mechanisms for generating Key Identifier\
    \ values using SHA-256,\n   SHA-384, and SHA-512 [SHS] that are similar to those\
    \ examples defined\n   in [RFC5280] as well as one based on hashing the certificate's\n\
    \   Subject Public Key Info field.\n"
- title: 2.  Additional Methods for Generating Key Identifiers
  contents:
  - "2.  Additional Methods for Generating Key Identifiers\n   [RFC5280] specifies\
    \ two examples for generating key identifiers from\n   public keys.  Four additional\
    \ mechanisms are as follows:\n   1) The keyIdentifier is composed of the leftmost\
    \ 160-bits of the\n      SHA-256 hash of the value of the BIT STRING subjectPublicKey\n\
    \      (excluding the tag, length, and number of unused bits).\n   2) The keyIdentifier\
    \ is composed of the leftmost 160-bits of the\n      SHA-384 hash of the value\
    \ of the BIT STRING subjectPublicKey\n      (excluding the tag, length, and number\
    \ of unused bits).\n   3) The keyIdentifier is composed of the leftmost 160-bits\
    \ of the\n      SHA-512 hash of the value of the BIT STRING subjectPublicKey\n\
    \      (excluding the tag, length, and number of unused bits).\n   4) The keyIdentifier\
    \ is composed of the hash of the DER encoding of\n      the SubjectPublicKeyInfo\
    \ value.\n"

- title: 4.  Security Considerations

  - "4.  Security Considerations\n   The security considerations of [RFC5280] apply\
    \ to certificates.  The\n   security considerations of [RFC5758] apply to the\
    \ hash algorithms.\n   While hash algorithms provide preimage resistance, second-preimage\n\
    \   resistance, and collision resistance, none of these properties are\n   needed\
    \ for key identifiers.\n"
