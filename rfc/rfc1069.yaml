  - "Status of This Memo\n   This RFC suggests an addressing scheme for use with the\
    \ ISO\n   Connectionless Network Protocol (CLNP) in the Internet.  This is a\n\
    \   solution to one of the problems inherent in the use of \"ISO-grams\" in\n\
    \   the Internet.  This RFC suggests a proposed protocol for the Internet\n  \
    \ community, and requests discussion and suggestions for improvements.\n   Distribution\
    \ of this memo is unlimited.\n   This memo is a revision of RFC 986.  Changes\
    \ were made in order to\n   allow the addressing used in the CLNP in the Internet\
    \ to be\n   potentially useful for routing in the context of new inter- and\n\
    \   intra-domain routing protocols, and in the context of large numbers\n   of\
    \ networks and routing domains.  The addressing scheme proposed in\n   this RFC\
    \ allows individual routing domains to make use of internal\n   routing algorithms\
    \ utilizing a variety of addressing formats, while\n   still providing for a common\
    \ addressing approach for use by inter-\n   domain routing.  These features are\
    \ important due to the rapid growth\n   currently being experienced in the Internet.\n"

  - "1.  Objectives\n   The data communications protocols currently emerging out of\
    \ the\n   international standardization efforts warrant an early integration\n\
    \   into the existing extensive Internet network infrastructure.  The two\n  \
    \ possible approaches are a top-down one, where ISO applications like\n   FTAM,\
    \ X.400 and VTP are integrated on top of the transport function\n   of the IP\
    \ protocol suite, or a bottom-up approach where the whole ISO\n   tower gets integrated\
    \ without merging the two suites.  The bottom-up\n   approach may make use of\
    \ the fact that the ISO-CLNP and the IP are\n   very similar in function.  This\
    \ implies that it is reasonable to\n   implement a multiprotocol function in some\
    \ or all of the Internet\n   gateways (potentially including part or all of the\
    \ Internet\n   environment).  The result would be that at least large portions\
    \ of\n   the Internet, in particular the backbones, can become usable for full\n\
    \   implementations of the ISO protocol stack.\n   A major problem with this approach\
    \ is that there are open issues with\n   regard to the ISO addressing within the\
    \ CLNP.  In particular, the ISO\n   network layer addressing standard allows a\
    \ great deal of flexibility\n   in the assignment of addresses, and a particular\
    \ address format must\n   be chosen.  A further problem is the need for implementation\
    \ and\n   integration of routing facilities for the ISO-compatible subset of\n\
    \   the Internet environment.\n   This paper proposed to use addresses which are\
    \ considerably more\n   flexible than the addresses used in the current IP Internet\n\
    \   environment.  This flexibility is necessary in order to allow some\n   routing\
    \ domains to base their internal routing protocol on addresses\n   derived from\
    \ the current IP addresses, to allow other routing domains\n   to base routing\
    \ on addresses in accordance to the intra-domain\n   routing protocol being developed\
    \ by ANSI and ISO [6], and to allow\n   generality for a future inter-domain routing\
    \ protocol.\n   The addressing scheme proposed here makes use of the concept of\n\
    \   \"routing domains\" as used in ANSI and ISO.  This concept is similar\n  \
    \ to, but not identical with, the concept of \"Autonomous System\" used\n   in\
    \ the Internet.  Routing domains include a combination of gateways,\n   networks,\
    \ and end systems (not just gateways), and routing domain\n   boundaries may be\
    \ used to define associated access control and policy\n   routing constraints.\
    \  Like autonomous systems, routing domains may be\n   assumed to be topologically\
    \ contiguous.  There is no a priori reason\n   why routing domains assigned for\
    \ use with the ISO IP need to have any\n   particular relation with existing autonomous\
    \ systems which have been\n   assigned for use with the IP.  The assignment of\
    \ specific routing\n   domain identifiers is an \"assigned numbers\" function\
    \ which is\n   necessary for use of the ISO IP in the Internet, but is beyond\
    \ the\n   scope of this document.\n   It is expected that this addressing scheme\
    \ will be appropriate for\n   long term use with the ISO IP in the Internet. \
    \ However, it is also\n   expected that in the long term, the Internet will be\
    \ interconnected\n   with other routing domains making use of other schemes, such\
    \ as\n   addresses assigned to commercial internets through ANSI, and\n   addresses\
    \ assigned by national standards organizations in other\n   countries.  This implies\
    \ that, in the long term, gateways in the\n   Internet will need to be able to\
    \ route datagrams to destinations in\n   other routing domains not conforming\
    \ to the addressing format\n   proposed here.  This is discussed in greater detail\
    \ in section 6.\n"

- title: 3.  Addresses for Use in the Internet
  contents:
  - "3.  Addresses for Use in the Internet\n   This section describes the addresses\
    \ used to address NSAPs in the\n   Internet.\n   The appropriate Authority and\
    \ Format Identifier (AFI) is one octet in\n   length.  It specifies an ISO-6523-ICD\
    \ assignment, and also that the\n   Domain Specific Part (DSP) of the address\
    \ is based on binary.  The\n   AFI octet uses the value \"47\".  The ISO-6523-ICD\
    \ format is used to\n   emphasize that this is an administrative assignment. \
    \ The usage of an\n   ISO DCC (Data Country Code) would be possible, but could\
    \ be\n   misleading due to the fairly far spread geographical extent of the\n\
    \   Internet.\n   As required by the ISO addressing standard, the next two octets\
    \ of\n   the address, in this case, specify the Initial Domain Identifier.\n \
    \  This two octet value is the International Code Designator (ICD)\n   assigned\
    \ to the Internet, \"0006\".\n   The remainder of the NSAP address is the Domain\
    \ Specific Part (DSP).\n   This is assigned by the Internet administration, which\
    \ is considered\n   to be an addressing domain.  Note that there is no particular\n\
    \   relationship required between addressing domains and routing domains.\n  \
    \ In this case, although the Internet is considered to be a single\n   addressing\
    \ domain, it is expected that it will consist of multiple\n   routing domains.\n\
    \   The DSP of the address specifies a one octet version number, a two\n   octet\
    \ global area number, a two octet routing domain number, a\n   variable length\
    \ padding field, a variable length IGP specific part,\n   and a one octet selector\
    \ field.\n   The version number is provided to allow for future extensions, and\n\
    \   must contain the value \"02\".\n   The global area number and routing domain\
    \ number are provided to\n   allow for inter-domain routing.  Initially, the global\
    \ area number is\n   reserved and must be set to zero.  The routing domain number\
    \ may be\n   set to the routing domain number of any gateway by which the\n  \
    \ associated host address is directly reachable.\n   The IGP specific part of\
    \ the address may contain whatever addressing\n   format is used in the routing\
    \ domain.  Two particular formats are\n   expected to be used initially, and are\
    \ presented in section 4.\n   Padding is used so that the entire address will\
    \ always be 20 octets\n   in length.\n   The selector field performs the same\
    \ function as the user protocol\n   field in the IP header.  This is necessary\
    \ because the ISO protocol\n   considers identification of the user protocol to\
    \ be an addressing\n   issue, and therefore does not allow for the user protocol\
    \ to be\n   specified in the protocol header independently from the address.\n\
    \   The assignment of specific routing domain identifiers to defined\n   routing\
    \ domains, and the assignment of values for use in the selector\n   field, are\
    \ functions for the Assigned Numbers authority for the\n   Internet [4].  The\
    \ specific values to be used are outside of the\n   scope of this document.\n\
    \   In summary, a source or destination address within the ISO\n   Connectionless\
    \ Protocol, when used in the Internet, looks as follows:\n                   \

    \ to the Internet\n   only indirectly via public data networks, and simple LANs\
    \ which are\n   similarly attached only via Public Data Networks, may make use\
    \ of a\n   separate address format based on their X.121 address.  Such addresses\n\
    \   may, for example, use the ISO-X.121 address format discussed in [3].\n   These\
    \ addresses will need to be handled for routing purposes in much\n   the same\
    \ way as addresses in routing domains which have been\n   interconnected to the\
    \ Internet, but which use other address formats,\n   such as those specified by\
    \ national standards bodies.\n"

  - "6.  Migration to Future Routing Protocols\n   Initially, routing of ISO datagrams\
    \ in the Internet may make use of\n   the first 8 octets of the address (AFI,\
    \ ICD, version, global area\n   number, and routing domain number) as a flat field\
    \ identifying the\n   routing domain.  This implies that if EGP is initially used\
    \ for\n   routing between routing domains, a new version of EGP may be required\n\
    \   to carry 8 octet routing domain numbers instead of 3 octet network\n   numbers.\n\
    \   There are currently several efforts underway to determine the\n   requirements\
    \ for inter-autonomous system routing, and to define a new\n   protocol.  One\
    \ of the requirements of inter-autonomous system routing\n   is the need to be\
    \ able to deal with a very large Internet.  It is\n   anticipated that during\
    \ the lifetime of the addressing scheme\n   described in this RFC the number of\
    \ networks in the Internet will\n   grow to the point where it is no longer feasible\
    \ for any gateway to\n   maintain separate routes to every network in the Internet.\
    \  Allowing\n   inter-domain routing to be done by routing domain number instead\
    \ of\n   network number is therefore a necessary step in the long term.\n   It\
    \ is difficult to anticipate the rate at which the number of routing\n   domains\
    \ may grow.  For example, during a period of time in which the\n   number of networks\
    \ grows by a factor of 100, it is not clear whether\n   the number of routing\
    \ domains may also be expected to grow by a\n   factor of 100, or by some lesser\
    \ amount.  It is possible that the\n   number of routing domains will also grow\
    \ to a point where it is not\n   feasible for a single gateway to maintain separate\
    \ routes to each.\n   In order to prepare for this eventuality, we have provided\
    \ for a\n   \"global area\" field.\n   In the long term, it will be necessary\
    \ for gateways to route to\n   destinations which are in routing domains utilizing\
    \ other addressing\n   formats, specified by other organizations such as ANSI,\
    \ ECMA, etc.\n   In this case, it will not be possible to ensure that the first\
    \ 8\n   octets of the address specifies the routing domain.  In the long\n   term,\
    \ it will therefore be necessary to route based on variable\n   length routing\
    \ domain identifiers.  It may be assumed that future\n   inter-domain routing\
    \ protocols will allow for specification of either\n   (1) an address mask, specifying\
    \ which part of an address is relevant\n   for specifying those destinations which\
    \ are reachable via a\n   particular domain; or (2) a length field, specifying\
    \ how many leading\n   octets in a particular address are relevant.  Specification\
    \ of the\n   details of such a routing protocol is beyond the scope of this\n\
    \   document.\n"
