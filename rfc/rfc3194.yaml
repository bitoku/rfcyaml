- title: 1. Evaluating the efficiency of address allocation
  contents:
  - "1. Evaluating the efficiency of address allocation\n   A naive observer might\
    \ assume that the number of addressable objects\n   in an addressing plan is a\
    \ linear function of the size of the\n   address.  If this were true, a telephone\
    \ numbering plan based on 10\n   digits would be able to number 10 billion telephones,\
    \ and the IPv4 32\n   bit addresses would be adequate for numbering 4 billion\
    \ computers\n   (using the American English definition of a billion, i.e. one\n\
    \   thousand millions.) We all know that this is not correct: the 10\n   digit\
    \ plan is stressed today, and it handles only a few hundred\n   million telephones\
    \ in North America; the Internet registries have\n   started to implement increasingly\
    \ restrictive allocation policies\n   when there were only a few tens of million\
    \ computers on the Internet.\n   Addressing plans are typically organized as a\
    \ hierarchy: in\n   telephony, the first digits will designate a region, the next\
    \ digits\n   will designate an exchange, and the last digits will designate a\n\
    \   subscriber within this exchange; in computer networks, the most\n   significant\
    \ bits will designate an address range allocated to a\n   network provider, the\
    \ next bits will designate the network of an\n   organization served by that provider,\
    \ and then the subnet to which\n   the individual computers are connected.  At\
    \ each level of the\n   hierarchy, one has to provide some margins:  one has to\
    \ allocate more\n   digits to the region code than the current number of regions\
    \ would\n   necessitate, and more bits in a subnet than strictly required by the\n\
    \   number of computers.  The number of elements in any given level of\n   the\
    \   hierarchy will change over time, due to growth and mobility.\n   If the current\
    \ allocation is exceeded, one has to engage in\n   renumbering, which is painful\
    \ and expensive.  In short, trying to\n   squeeze too many objects into a hierarchical\
    \ address space increases\n   the level of pain endured by operators and subscribers.\n\
    \   Back in 1993, when we were debating the revision of the Internet\n   Protocol,\
    \ we wondered what the acceptable ratio of utilization was of\n   a given addressing\
    \ plan.  Coming out with such a ratio was useful to\n   assess how many computers\
    \ could be connected to the Internet with the\n   current 32-bit addresses, as\
    \ well as to decide the size of the next\n   generation addresses.  The second\
    \ point is now decided, with 128-bits\n   addresses for IPv6, but the first question\
    \ is still relevant:\n   knowing the capacity of the current address plan will\
    \ help us predict\n   the date at which this capacity will be exceeded.\n   Participants\
    \ in the IPNG debates initially measured the efficiency of\n   address allocation\
    \ by simply dividing the number of allocated\n   addresses by the size of the\
    \ address space.  This is a simple\n   measure, but it is largely dependent on\
    \ the size of the address\n   space.  Loss of efficiency at each level of a hierarchical\
    \ plan has a\n   multiplicative effect; for example, 50% efficiency at each stage\
    \ of a\n   three level hierarchy results in a overall efficiency of 12.5%.  If\n\
    \   we want a \"pain level indicator\", we have to use a ratio that takes\n  \
    \ into account these multiplicative effects.\n   The \"H-Ratio\" defined in RFC\
    \ 1715 proposed to measure the efficiency\n   of address allocation as the ratio\
    \ of the base 10 logarithm of the\n   number of allocated addresses to the size\
    \ of the address in bits.\n   This provides an address size independent ratio,\
    \ but the definition\n   of the H ratio results in values in the range of 0.0\
    \ to 0.30103, with\n   typical values ranging from 0.20 to 0.28.  Experience has\
    \ shown that\n   these numbers are difficult to explain to others; it would be\
    \ easier\n   to say that \"your address bits are used to 83% of their H-Density\"\
    ,\n   and then explain what the H-Density is, than to say \"you are hitting\n\
    \   a H ratio of 0.25\" and then explain what exactly the range is.\n   This memo\
    \ introduces the Host Density ratio or \"HD-Ratio\", a proposed\n   replacement\
    \ for the H-Ratio defined in RFC 1715.  The HD values range\n   from 0 to 1, and\
    \ are generally expressed as percentage points; the\n   authors believe that this\
    \ new formulation is easier to understand and\n   more expressive than the H-Ratio.\n"
- title: 2. Definition of the HD-ratio
  contents:
  - "2. Definition of the HD-ratio\n   When considering an addressing plan to allocate\
    \ objects, the host\n   density ratio HD is defined as follow:\n             \
    \ log(number of allocated objects)\n   HD = ------------------------------------------\n\
    \         log(maximum number of allocatable objects)\n   This ratio is defined\
    \ for any number of allocatable objects greater\n   than 1 and any number of allocated\
    \ objects greater or equal than 1\n   and less than or equal the maximum number\
    \ of allocatable objects.\n   The ratio is usually presented as a percentage,\
    \ e.g. 70%.  It varies\n   between 0 (0%), when there is just one allocation,\
    \ and 1 (100%), when\n   there is one object allocated to each available address.\
    \  Note that\n   for the calculation of the HD-ratio, one can use any base for\
    \ the\n   logarithm as long as it is the same for both the numerator and the\n\
    \   denominator.\n   The HD-ratio can, in most cases, be derived from the H ratio\
    \ by the\n   formula:\n           H\n   HD = --------\n        log10(2)\n"
- title: 3. Using the HD-ratio as an indicator of the pain level
  contents:
  - "3. Using the HD-ratio as an indicator of the pain level\n   In order to assess\
    \ whether the H-Ratio was a good predictor of the\n   \"pain level\" caused by\
    \ a specific efficiency, RFC1715 used several\n   examples of networks that had\
    \ reached their capacity limit.  These\n   could be for example telephone networks\
    \ at the point when they\n   decided to add digits to their numbering plans, or\
    \ computer networks\n   at the point when their addressing capabilities were perceived\
    \ as\n   stretched beyond practical limits.  The idea behind these examples is\n\
    \   that network managers would delay renumbering or changing the network\n  \
    \ protocol until it became just too painful; the ratio just before the\n   change\
    \ is thus a good predictor of what can be achieved in practice.\n   The examples\
    \ were the following:\n   * Adding one digit to all French telephone numbers,\
    \ moving from 8\n   digits to 9, when the number of phones reached a threshold\
    \ of 1.0\n   E+7.\n                                  log(1.0E+7)\n      HD(FrenchTelephone8digit)\
    \ = ----------- = 0.8750 = 87.5%\n                                  log(1.0E+8)\n\
    \                                  log(1.0E+7)\n      HD(FrenchTelephone9digit)\
    \ = ----------- = 0.7778 = 77.8%\n                                  log(1.0E+9)\n\
    \   * Expanding the number of areas in the US telephone system, making\n   the\
    \ phone number effectively 10 digits long instead of \"9.2\" (the\n   second digit\
    \ of area codes used to be limited to 0 or 1) for about\n   1.0 E+8 subscribers.\n\
    \                                log(1.0E+8)\n      HD(USTelephone9.2digit) =\
    \ ------------ = 0.8696 = 87.0 %\n                                log(9.5E+9)\n\
    \                                log(1.0E+8)\n      HD(USTelephone10digit)  =\
    \ ------------ = 0.8000 = 80.0 %\n                                log(1E+10)\n\
    \   * The globally-connected physics/space science DECnet (Phase IV)\n   stopped\
    \ growing at about 15K nodes (i.e. new nodes were hidden) in a\n   16 bit address\
    \ space.\n                      log(15000)\n      HD(DecNET IV) = ---------- =\
    \ 0.8670 = 86.7 %\n                      log(2^16)\n   From those examples, we\
    \ can note that these addressing systems\n   reached their limits for very close\
    \ values of the HD-ratio.  We can\n   use the same examples to confirm that the\
    \ definition of the HD-ratio\n   as a quotient of logarithms results in better\
    \ prediction than the\n   direct quotient of allocated objects over size of the\
    \ address space.\n   In our three examples, the direct quotients were 10%, 3.2%\
    \ and 22.8%,\n   three very different numbers that don't lead to any obvious\n\
    \   generalization.  The examples suggest an HD-ratio value on the order\n   of\
    \ 85% and above correspond to a high pain level, at which operators\n   are ready\
    \ to make drastic decisions.\n   We can also examine our examples and hypothesize\
    \ that the operators\n   who renumbered their networks tried to reach, after the\
    \ renumbering,\n   a pain level that was easily supported.  The HD-ratio of the\
    \ French\n   or US network immediately after renumbering was 78% and 80%,\n  \
    \ respectively.  This suggests that values of 80% or less corresponds\n   to comfortable\
    \ trade-offs between pain and efficiency.\n"
- title: 4. Using the HD-ratio to evaluate the capacity of addressing plans
  contents:
  - "4. Using the HD-ratio to evaluate the capacity of addressing plans\n   Directly\
    \ using the HD-ratio makes it easy to evaluate the density of\n   allocated objects.\
    \  Evaluating how well an addressing plan will scale\n   requires the reverse\
    \ calculation.  We have seen in section 3.1 that\n   an HD-ratio lower than 80%\
    \ is manageable, and that HD-ratios higher\n   than 87% are hard to sustain. \
    \ This should enable us to compute the\n   acceptable and \"practical maximum\"\
    \ number of objects that can be\n   allocated given a specific address size, using\
    \ the formula:\n   number allocatable of objects\n               = exp( HD x log(maximum\
    \ number allocatable of objects))\n               = (maximum number allocatable\
    \ of objects)^HD\n   The following table provides example values for a 9-digit\
    \ telephone\n   plan, a 10-digit telephone plan, and the 32-bit IPv4 Internet:\n\

    \    154 M    192 M      240 M\n   Note: 1M = 1,000,000\n   Indeed, the practical\
    \ maximum depends on the level of pain that the\n   users and providers are willing\
    \ to accept.  We may very well end up\n   with more than 154M allocated IPv4 addresses\
    \ in the next years, if we\n   are willing to accept the pain.\n"
