- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   Many who participate in the IETF are most comfortable making\
    \ what we\n   believe to be purely technical decisions; our process favors\n \
    \  technical merit through our well-known mantra of \"rough consensus and\n  \
    \ running code.\"\n   Nevertheless, the running code that results from our process\
    \ (when\n   things work well) inevitably has an impact beyond technical\n   considerations,\
    \ because the underlying decisions afford some uses\n   while discouraging others.\
    \  While we believe we are making only\n   technical decisions, in reality, we\
    \ are defining (in some degree)\n   what is possible on the Internet itself.\n\
    \   This impact has become significant.  As the Internet increasingly\n   mediates\
    \ essential functions in societies, it has unavoidably become\n   profoundly political;\
    \ it has helped people overthrow governments,\n   revolutionize social orders,\
    \ swing elections, control populations,\n   collect data about individuals, and\
    \ reveal secrets.  It has created\n   wealth for some individuals and companies\
    \ while destroying that of\n   others.\n   All of this raises the question: For\
    \ whom do we go through the pain\n   of gathering rough consensus and writing\
    \ running code?\n   After all, there are a variety of parties that standards can\
    \ benefit,\n   such as (but not limited to) end users, network operators, schools,\n\
    \   equipment vendors, specification authors, specification implementers,\n  \
    \ content owners, governments, nongovernmental organizations, social\n   movements,\
    \ employers, and parents.\n   Successful specifications will provide some benefit\
    \ to all the\n   relevant parties because standards do not represent a zero-sum\
    \ game.\n   However, there are sometimes situations where there is a conflict\n\
    \   between the needs of two (or more) parties.\n   In these situations, when\
    \ one of those parties is an \"end user\" of\n   the Internet -- for example,\
    \ a person using a web browser, mail\n   client, or another agent that connects\
    \ to the Internet -- the\n   Internet Architecture Board argues that the IETF\
    \ should favor their\n   interests over those of other parties.\n   Section 2\
    \ explains what is meant by \"end users\", Section 3 outlines\n   why IETF work\
    \ should prioritize them, and Section 4 describes how we\n   can do that.\n"
- title: 2.  Who Are "End Users"?
  contents:
  - "2.  Who Are \"End Users\"?\n   In this document, \"end users\" means human users\
    \ whose activities IETF\n   standards support, sometimes indirectly.  Thus, the\
    \ end user of a\n   protocol to manage routers is not a router administrator;\
    \ it is the\n   people using the network that the router operates within.\n  \
    \ End users are not necessarily a homogenous group; they might have\n   different\
    \ views of how the Internet should work and might occupy\n   several roles, such\
    \ as a seller, buyer, publisher, reader, service\n   provider, and consumer. \
    \ An end user might browse the Web, monitor\n   remote equipment, play a game,\
    \ videoconference with colleagues, send\n   messages to friends, or perform an\
    \ operation in a remote surgery\n   theater.  They might be \"at the keyboard\"\
    \ or represented by software\n   indirectly (e.g., as a daemon).\n   Likewise,\
    \ an individual end user might have many interests (e.g.,\n   privacy, security,\
    \ flexibility, reachability) that are sometimes in\n   tension.\n   A person whose\
    \ interests we need to consider might not directly be\n   using a specific system\
    \ connected to the Internet.  For example, if a\n   child is using a browser,\
    \ the interests of that child's parents or\n   guardians may be relevant.  A person\
    \ pictured in a photograph may\n   have an interest in systems that process that\
    \ photograph; a person\n   entering a room with sensors that send data to the\
    \ Internet may have\n   interests that may be involved in our deliberations about\
    \ how those\n   sensor readings are handled.\n   While such less-direct interactions\
    \ between people and the Internet\n   may be harder to evaluate, this document's\
    \ concept of \"end user\"\n   nonetheless includes such people.\n"
- title: 3.  Why the IETF Should Prioritize End Users
  contents:
  - "3.  Why the IETF Should Prioritize End Users\n   Even before the IETF was established,\
    \ the Internet technical\n   community has focused on user needs since at least\
    \ [RFC0001], which\n   stated that \"One of our goals must be to stimulate the\
    \ immediate and\n   easy use by a wide class of users.\"\n   And, while we specialize\
    \ in technical matters, the IETF is not\n   neutral about the purpose of its work\
    \ in developing the Internet; in\n   \"A Mission Statement for the IETF\" [RFC3935],\
    \ the definitions\n   include:\n   |  The IETF community wants the Internet to\
    \ succeed because we\n   |  believe that the existence of the Internet, and its\
    \ influence on\n   |  economics, communication, and education, will help us to\
    \ build a\n   |  better human society.\n   Later, in \"The Scope of the Internet\"\
    \ (Section 4.1 of [RFC3935]), it\n   says:\n   |  The Internet isn't value-neutral,\
    \ and neither is the IETF.  We\n   |  want the Internet to be useful for communities\
    \ that share our\n   |  commitment to openness and fairness.  We embrace technical\n\
    \   |  concepts such as decentralized control, edge-user empowerment and\n   |\
    \  sharing of resources, because those concepts resonate with the\n   |  core\
    \ values of the IETF community.  These concepts have little to\n   |  do with\
    \ the technology that's possible, and much to do with the\n   |  technology that\
    \ we choose to create.\n   In other words, the IETF develops and maintains the\
    \ Internet to\n   promote the social good.  The society that the IETF is attempting\
    \ to\n   enhance is composed of end users, along with groups of them forming\n\
    \   businesses, governments, clubs, civil society organizations, and\n   other\
    \ institutions.\n   Merely advancing the measurable success of the Internet (e.g.,\n\
    \   deployment size, bandwidth, latency, number of users) is not an\n   adequate\
    \ goal; doing so ignores how technology is so often used as a\n   lever to assert\
    \ power over users, rather than empower them.\n   Beyond fulfilling the IETF's\
    \ mission, prioritizing end users can also\n   help to ensure the long-term health\
    \ of the Internet and the IETF's\n   relevance to it.  Perceptions of capture\
    \ by vendors or other\n   providers harm both; the IETF's work will (deservedly)\
    \ lose end\n   users' trust if it prioritizes (or is perceived to prioritize)\n\
    \   others' interests over them.\n   Ultimately, the Internet will succeed or\
    \ fail based upon the actions\n   of its end users, because they are the driving\
    \ force behind its\n   growth to date.  Not prioritizing them jeopardizes the\
    \ network effect\n   that the Internet relies upon to provide so much value.\n"
- title: 4.  How the IETF Can Prioritize End Users
  contents:
  - "4.  How the IETF Can Prioritize End Users\n   There are a few ways that the IAB\
    \ believes the IETF community can\n   prioritize end users, based upon our observations.\
    \  This is not a\n   complete list.\n"
- title: 4.1.  Engaging the Internet Community
  contents:
  - "4.1.  Engaging the Internet Community\n   The IETF community does not have any\
    \ unique insight into what is\n   \"good for end users\", and it is not uncommon\
    \ for us to be at a\n   further disadvantage because of our close understanding\
    \ of some --\n   but not all -- aspects of the Internet.\n   At the same time,\
    \ we have a culture of considerable deference to a\n   broader \"Internet community\"\
    \ -- roughly what this document calls end\n   users -- in our decision-making\
    \ processes.  Mere deference, however,\n   is not adequate; even with the best\
    \ intentions, we cannot assume that\n   our experiences of the Internet are those\
    \ of all of its end users or\n   that our decisions have a positive impact upon\
    \ them.\n   Therefore, we have not only a responsibility to analyze and consider\n\
    \   the impacts of the IETF's work, but also a responsibility to consult\n   with\
    \ that greater Internet community.  In particular, we should do so\n   when one\
    \ of our decisions has a potential impact upon end users.\n   The IETF community\
    \ faces significant hurdles in doing so.  Our work\n   is specialized and often\
    \ esoteric, and processes for developing\n   standards often involve very long\
    \ timescales.  Affected parties are\n   rarely technical experts, and they often\
    \ base their understanding of\n   the Internet upon incomplete (and sometimes\
    \ inaccurate) models.\n   Often, even when we try to engage a broader audience,\
    \ their\n   participation is minimal -- until a change affects someone in a way\n\
    \   they don't like.  Surprising the Internet community is rarely a good\n   outcome.\n\
    \   Government-sponsored individuals sometimes participate in the IETF\n   community.\
    \  While this is welcome, it should not be taken as\n   automatically representative\
    \ of end users elsewhere, or even all end\n   users in the relevant jurisdiction.\
    \  Furthermore, what is desirable\n   in one jurisdiction (or at least to its\
    \ administrators) might be\n   detrimental in others (see Section 4.4).\n   While\
    \ some civil society organizations specialize in technology and\n   Internet policy,\
    \ they rarely can participate broadly, nor are they\n   necessarily representative\
    \ of the larger Internet community.\n   Nevertheless, their understanding of end-user\
    \ needs is often\n   profound, and they are in many ways the best-informed advocates\
    \ for\n   end-user concerns; they should be considered a primary channel for\n\
    \   engaging the broader Internet community.\n   A promising approach to help\
    \ fill these gaps is to identify and\n   engage with specifically affected communities\
    \ when making decisions\n   that might affect them, for example, one or more industry\n\
    \   associations, user groups, or a set of individuals, though we can't\n   formally\
    \ ensure that they are appropriately representative.\n   In doing so, we should\
    \ not require them to \"come to us\"; unless a\n   stakeholder community is already\
    \ engaged in the IETF process\n   effectively, the IETF community should explore\
    \ how to meet with them\n   on their terms -- take the initiative to contact them,\
    \ explain our\n   work, and solicit their feedback.\n   In particular, while IAB\
    \ workshops, BOFs, and Bar BOFs can be an\n   effective mechanism to gather input\
    \ within our community, they rarely\n   have the visibility into other communities\
    \ that is required to\n   solicit input, much less effective participation.\n\
    \   Instead, an event like a workshop may be more effective if co-located\n  \
    \ with -- and ideally hosted or co-hosted by -- a forum that's familiar\n   to\
    \ that stakeholder community.  We should also raise the visibility\n   of IETF\
    \ work (or potential IETF work) in such fora through conference\n   talks, panels,\
    \ newsletter articles, etc.\n   For example, the IAB ESCAPE workshop [RFC8752]\
    \ solicited input from\n   Internet publishers and advertisers about a proposal\
    \ that might\n   affect them.  While the workshop was considered successful,\n\
    \   participation might have been improved by identifying an appropriate\n   industry\
    \ forum and working with them to host the event.\n   When we engage with the Internet\
    \ community, we should also clearly\n   identify tailored feedback mechanisms\
    \ (e.g., subscribing to a mailing\n   list may not be appropriate) and assure\
    \ that they are well known in\n   those communities.\n   The Internet Society\
    \ can be an invaluable partner in these efforts;\n   their focus on the Internet\
    \ community, policy expertise, and\n   resources can help to facilitate discussions\
    \ with the appropriate\n   parties.\n   Finally, we should remember that the RFC\
    \ Series contains Requests For\n   Comments; if there are serious implications\
    \ of our work, we should\n   document them and ask for feedback from the Internet\
    \ community.\n"
- title: 4.2.  Creating User-Focused Systems
  contents:
  - "4.2.  Creating User-Focused Systems\n   We should pay particular attention to\
    \ the kinds of architectures we\n   create and whether they encourage or discourage\
    \ an Internet that\n   works for end users.\n   For example, one of the most successful\
    \ Internet applications is the\n   Web, which uses the HTTP application protocol.\
    \  One of HTTP's key\n   implementation roles is that of the web browser -- called\
    \ the \"user\n   agent\" in [RFC7230] and other specifications.\n   User agents\
    \ act as intermediaries between a service and the end user;\n   rather than downloading\
    \ an executable program from a service that has\n   arbitrary access into the\
    \ users' system, the user agent only allows\n   limited access to display content\
    \ and run code in a sandboxed\n   environment.  End users are diverse and the\
    \ ability of a few user\n   agents to represent individual interests properly\
    \ is imperfect, but\n   this arrangement is an improvement over the alternative\
    \ -- the need\n   to trust a website completely with all information on your system\
    \ to\n   browse it.\n   Defining the user agent role in standards also creates\
    \ a virtuous\n   cycle; it allows multiple implementations, allowing end users\
    \ to\n   switch between them with relatively low costs (although there are\n \
    \  concerns about the complexity of the Web creating barriers to entry\n   for\
    \ new implementations).  This creates an incentive for implementers\n   to consider\
    \ the users' needs carefully, which are often reflected\n   into the defining\
    \ standards.  The resulting ecosystem has many\n   remaining problems, but a distinguished\
    \ user agent role provides an\n   opportunity to improve it.\n   In contrast,\
    \ the Internet of Things (IoT) has not yet seen the broad\n   adoption of a similar\
    \ role; many current systems require opaque,\n   vendor-specific software or hardware\
    \ for the user-facing component.\n   Perhaps as a result of this, that ecosystem\
    \ and its end users face\n   serious challenges.\n"
- title: 4.3.  Identifying Negative End-User Impact
  contents:
  - "4.3.  Identifying Negative End-User Impact\n   At its best, our work will unambiguously\
    \ build a better human\n   society.  Sometimes, we will consciously be neutral\
    \ and open-ended,\n   allowing the \"tussle\" among stakeholders to produce a\
    \ range of\n   results (see [TUSSLE] for further discussion).\n   At the very\
    \ least, however, we must examine our work for negative\n   impact on end users\
    \ and take steps to mitigate it where encountered.\n   In particular, when we've\
    \ identified a conflict between the interests\n   of end users and other stakeholders,\
    \ we should err on the side of\n   protecting end users.\n   Note that \"negative\
    \ impact on end users\" is not defined in this\n   document; that is something\
    \ that the relevant body (e.g., working\n   group) needs to discuss and come to\
    \ consensus on.  Merely asserting\n   that something is harmful is not adequate.\
    \  The converse is also\n   true, though; it's not good practice to avoid identifying\
    \ harms, nor\n   is it acceptable to ignore them when brought to our attention.\n\
    \   The IAB and IETF have already established a body of guidance for\n   situations\
    \ where this conflict is common, including (but not limited\n   to) [RFC7754]\
    \ on filtering, [RFC7258] and [RFC7624] on pervasive\n   surveillance, [RFC7288]\
    \ on host firewalls, and [RFC6973] regarding\n   privacy considerations.\n   Much\
    \ of that advice has focused on maintaining the end-to-end\n   properties of a\
    \ connection [RFC3724].  This does not mean that our\n   responsibility to end\
    \ users stops there; decisions might affect them\n   in other ways.  For example,\
    \ data collection by various applications\n   even inside otherwise secure connections\
    \ is a major problem on the\n   Internet today.  Also, inappropriate concentration\
    \ of power on the\n   Internet has become a concerning phenomenon -- one that\
    \ protocol\n   design might have some influence upon.\n"
- title: 4.4.  Handling Conflicting End-User Needs
  contents:
  - "4.4.  Handling Conflicting End-User Needs\n   When the needs of different end\
    \ users conflict (for example, two sets\n   of end users both have reasonable\
    \ desires), we again should try to\n   minimize negative impact.\n   For example,\
    \ when a decision improves the Internet for end users in\n   one jurisdiction,\
    \ but at the cost of potential harm to others\n   elsewhere, that is not a good\
    \ trade-off.  As such, we design the\n   Internet for the pessimal environment;\
    \ if a user can be harmed, they\n   probably will be, somewhere.\n   There may\
    \ be cases where genuine technical need requires compromise.\n   However, such\
    \ trade-offs are carefully examined and avoided when\n   there are alternate means\
