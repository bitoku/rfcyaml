- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   As the spam problem continues to expand and potential solutions\n\
    \   evolve, mail operators are increasingly exchanging abuse reports\n   among\
    \ themselves and other parties.  However, different operators\n   have defined\
    \ their own formats, and thus the receivers of these\n   reports are forced to\
    \ write custom software to interpret each of\n   them.  In addition, many operators\
    \ use various other report formats\n   to provide non-abuse-related feedback about\
    \ processed email.  This\n   memo uses the \"multipart/report\" content type defined\
    \ in [REPORT],\n   and in that context defines a standard extensible format by\
    \ creating\n   the \"message/feedback-report\" [MIME] type for these reports.\n\
    \   While there has been previous work in this area (e.g., [STRADS-BCP]\n   and\
    \ [ASRG-ABUSE]), none of it has yet been successful.  It is hoped\n   that this\
    \ document will have a better fate.\n   This format is intended primarily as an\
    \ Abuse Reporting Format (ARF)\n   for reporting email abuse but also includes\
    \ support for direct\n   feedback via end user mail clients, reports of some types\
    \ of virus\n   activity, and some similar issues.  This memo also contains provision\n\
    \   for extensions should other specific types of reports be desirable in\n  \
    \ the future.\n   This document only defines the format and [MIME] content type\
    \ to be\n   used for these reports.  Determination of where these reports should\n\
    \   be sent, validation of their contents, and how trust among report\n   generators\
    \ and report recipients is established are outside the scope\n   of this document.\
    \  It is assumed that best practices will evolve over\n   time, and will be codified\
    \ in future documents.\n"
- title: 1.1.  Purpose
  contents:
  - "1.1.  Purpose\n   The reports defined in this document are intended to inform\
    \ mail\n   operators about:\n   o  email abuse originating from their networks;\n\
    \   o  potential issues with the perceived quality of outbound mail, such\n  \
    \    as email service providers sending mail that attracts the\n      attention\
    \ of automated abuse detection systems.\n   Please note that while the parent\
    \ \"multipart/report\" content type\n   defined in [REPORT] is used for all kinds\
    \ of administrative messages,\n   this format is intended specifically for communications\
    \ among\n   providers regarding email abuse and related issues, and SHOULD NOT\
    \ be\n   used for other reports.\n"
- title: 1.2.  Requirements
  contents:
  - "1.2.  Requirements\n   The following requirements are necessary for feedback\
    \ reports (the\n   actual specification is defined later in this document):\n\
    \   o  They must be both human and machine readable;\n   o  A copy of the original\
    \ email message (both body and header) or the\n      message header must be enclosed\
    \ in order to allow the receiver to\n      handle the report properly;\n   o \
    \ The machine-readable section must provide ability for the report\n      generators\
    \ to share meta-data with receivers;\n   o  The format must be extensible.\n"

    \ \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n   document are to be interpreted as described in [KEYWORDS].\n"
- title: 1.3.2.  Email Specific
  contents:
  - "1.3.2.  Email Specific\n   [EMAIL-ARCH] introduces several terms and concepts\
    \ that are used in\n   this memo, and thus readers are advised to become familiar\
    \ with it as\n   well.\n"
- title: 2.  Format of Email Feedback Reports
  contents:
  - "2.  Format of Email Feedback Reports\n   To satisfy the requirements, an email\
    \ feedback report is defined as a\n   [MIME] message with a top-level MIME content\
    \ type of \"multipart/\n   report\" (as defined in [REPORT]).  The following apply:\n\
    \   a.  The \"report-type\" parameter of the \"multipart/report\" type is set\n\
    \       to \"feedback-report\";\n   b.  The first MIME part of the message contains\
    \ a human-readable\n       description of the report and MUST be included.\n \
    \  c.  The second MIME part of the message is a machine-readable section\n   \
    \    with the content type of \"message/feedback-report\" (defined later\n   \
    \    in this memo) and MUST be included.  This section is intended to\n      \
    \ convey meta-data about the report in question that may not be\n       readily\
    \ available from the included email message itself.\n   d.  The third MIME part\
    \ of the message is either of type \"message/\n       rfc822\" (as defined in\
    \ [MIME-TYPES]) and contains the original\n       message in its entirety OR is\
    \ of type \"text/rfc822-headers\" (as\n       defined in [REPORT]) and contains\
    \ a copy of the entire header\n       block from the original message.  This part\
    \ MUST be included\n       (contrary to [REPORT]).  While some operators may choose\
    \ to\n       modify or redact this portion for privacy or legal reasons, it is\n\
    \       RECOMMENDED that the entire original email message be included\n     \
    \  without any modification as such modifications can impede\n       forensic\
    \ work by the recipient of this report.  See Section 8 for\n       further discussion.\n\
    \   e.  Except as discussed below, each feedback report MUST be related\n    \
    \   to only a single email message.  Summary and aggregate formats\n       are\
    \ outside of the scope of this specification.\n   f.  The Subject header field\
    \ of the feedback report SHOULD be the\n       same as the included email message\
    \ about which the report is\n       being generated.  If it differs, the difference\
    \ MUST be limited\n       to only a typical forwarding prefix used by Mail User\
    \ Agents\n       (MUAs) such as \"FW:\".  (Many smaller operators using MUAs for\n\
    \       abuse handling rely on the subject lines for processing.)\n   g.  The\
    \ primary evidence of the abuse being reported is found in the\n       third part\
    \ of the report, which contains the original message.\n       The second part\
    \ contains additional derived data that may help\n       the receiver, but in\
    \ terms of selecting actionable report data,\n       report recipients SHOULD\
    \ use the content of the third part first,\n       then data from the second part.\
    \  The first part is meant to\n       contain explanatory text for human use but\
    \ is not itself a part\n       of the report, and SHOULD NOT be used if it is\
    \ in conflict with\n       the other parts.\n"
- title: 3.  The 'message/feedback-report' Content Type
  contents:
  - "3.  The 'message/feedback-report' Content Type\n   A new [MIME] content type\
    \ called \"message/feedback-report\" is\n   defined.  This content type provides\
    \ a machine-readable section\n   intended to let the report generator convey meta-data\
    \ to the report\n   receiver.  The intent of this section is to convey information\
    \ that\n   may not be obvious or may not be easily extracted from the original\n\
    \   email message body or header.\n   The body of this content type consists of\
    \ multiple \"fields\" formatted\n   according to the ABNF of [MAIL] header fields.\
    \  This section defines\n   the initial set of fields provided by this specification.\
    \  Additional\n   fields may be registered according to the procedure described\
    \ later\n   in this memo.  Although these fields have a syntax similar to those\n\
    \   of mail message header fields, they are semantically distinct; hence,\n  \
    \ they SHOULD NOT be repeated as header fields of the message\n   containing the\
    \ report.  Note that these fields represent information\n   that the receiver\
    \ is asserting about the report in question, but are\n   not necessarily verifiable.\
    \  Report receivers MUST NOT assume that\n   these assertions are always accurate.\n\
    \   Note that the above limitation in no way restricts the use of message\n  \
    \ header fields that are registered in the IANA header field registry\n   with\
    \ the same field names.\n"
- title: 3.1.  Required Fields
  contents:
  - "3.1.  Required Fields\n   The following report header fields MUST appear exactly\
    \ once:\n   o  \"Feedback-Type\" contains the type of feedback report (as defined\n\
    \      in the corresponding IANA registry and later in this memo).  This\n   \
    \   is intended to let report parsers distinguish among different\n      types\
    \ of reports.\n   o  \"User-Agent\" indicates the name and version of the software\n\
    \      program that generated the report.  The format of this field MUST\n   \
    \   follow section 14.43 of [HTTP].  This field is for documentation\n      only;\
    \ there is no registry of user agent names or versions, and\n      report receivers\
    \ SHOULD NOT expect user agent names to belong to a\n      known set.\n   o  \"\
    Version\" indicates the version of specification that the report\n      generator\
    \ is using to generate the report.  The version number in\n      this specification\
    \ is set to \"1\".\n"
- title: 3.2.  Optional Fields Appearing Once
  contents:
  - "3.2.  Optional Fields Appearing Once\n   The following header fields are optional\
    \ and MUST NOT appear more\n   than once:\n   o  \"Original-Envelope-Id\" contains\
    \ the envelope ID string used in the\n      original [SMTP] transaction (see section\
    \ 2.2.1 of [DSN]).\n   o  \"Original-Mail-From\" contains a copy of the email\
    \ address used in\n      the MAIL FROM portion of the original SMTP transaction.\
    \  The\n      format of this field is defined in section 4.1.2 of [SMTP] as\n\
    \      \"Reverse-path\".\n   o  \"Arrival-Date\" indicates the date and time at\
    \ which the original\n      message was received by the Mail Transfer Agent (MTA)\
    \ of the\n      generating ADMD (Administrative Management Domain).  This field\n\
    \      MUST be formatted as per section 3.3 of [MAIL].\n   o  \"Reporting-MTA\"\
    \ indicates the name of the MTA generating this\n      feedback report.  This\
    \ field is defined in section 2.2.2 of [DSN],\n      except that it is an optional\
    \ field in this report.\n   o  \"Source-IP\" contains an IPv4 or IPv6 address\
    \ of the MTA from which\n      the original message was received.  Addresses MUST\
    \ be formatted as\n      per section 4.1.3 of [SMTP].\n   o  \"Incidents\" contains\
    \ an unsigned 32-bit integer indicating the\n      number of incidents this report\
    \ represents.  The absence of this\n      field implies the report covers a single\
    \ incident.\n   The historic field \"Received-Date\" SHOULD also be accepted and\n\
    \   interpreted identically to \"Arrival-Date\".  However, if both are\n   present,\
    \ the report is malformed and SHOULD be treated as described\n   in Section 4.\n"
- title: 3.3.  Optional Fields Appearing Multiple Times
  contents:

    \ fields are optional and may appear any\n   number of times as appropriate:\n\
    \   o  \"Authentication-Results\" indicates the result of one or more\n      authentication\
    \ checks run by the report generator.  The format of\n      this field is defined\
    \ in [AUTH-RESULTS].  Report receivers should\n      note that this field only\
    \ indicates an assertion made by the\n      report generator.\n   o  \"Original-Rcpt-To\"\
    \ includes a copy of the email address used in\n      the RCPT TO portion of the\
    \ original [SMTP] transaction.  The\n      format of this field is a \"Reverse-path\"\
    \ defined in section 4.1.2\n      of that memo.  This field SHOULD be repeated\
    \ for every SMTP\n      recipient seen by the report generator.\n   o  \"Reported-Domain\"\
    \ includes a domain name that the report generator\n      believes to be relevant\
    \ to the report, e.g., the domain whose\n      apparent actions provoked the generation\
    \ of the report.  It is\n      unspecified how the report generator determines\
    \ this information,\n      and thus the report receiver cannot be certain how\
    \ it was chosen.\n      It is often used as a means of suggesting to the report\
    \ receiver\n      how this report might be handled.  In cases where the derivation\n\
    \      is not obvious, the report generator is encouraged to clarify in\n    \
    \  the text section of the report.  Domain format is defined in\n      section\
    \ 2.3.1 of [DNS].\n   o  \"Reported-URI\" indicates a URI that the report generator\
    \ believes\n      to be relevant to the report, e.g., a suspect URI that was found\n\
    \      in the message that caused the report to be generated.  The same\n    \
    \  caveats about the origin of the value of \"Reported-Domain\" apply\n      to\

- title: 5.  Transport Considerations
  contents:
  - "5.  Transport Considerations\n   [DSN] requires that its reports be sent with\
    \ the empty [SMTP]\n   envelope sender to avoid bounce loops.  A similar requirement\
    \ was\n   considered for this specification, but it seems unlikely that an ARF\n\
    \   report would be generated in response to receipt of an ARF report,\n   and\
    \ furthermore such a requirement would prevent an ARF generator\n   from ever\
    \ determining that an ARF report was not actually received.\n   On the other hand,\
    \ if an ARF report is generated without the empty\n   envelope sender and is sent\
    \ to an address that actually does not\n   work, then the generating address can\

  - "6.  Extensibility\n   Like many other formats and protocols, this format may\
    \ need to be\n   extended over time to fit the ever-changing landscape of the\n\
    \   Internet.  Therefore, extensibility is provided via two IANA\n   registries:\
    \ one for feedback types and a second for report header\n   fields.  The feedback\
    \ type registry is to be used in conjunction with\n   the \"Feedback-Type\" field\
    \ above.  The header name registry is\n   intended for registration of new meta-data\
    \ fields to be used in the\n   machine-readable portion (part 2) of this format.\
    \  Please note that\n   version numbers do not change with new field registrations\
    \ unless a\n   new specification of this format is published.  Also, note that\
    \ all\n   new field registrations may only be registered as optional fields.\n\
    \   Any new required fields REQUIRE a new version of this specification\n   to\
    \ be published.\n   In order to encourage extensibility and interoperability of\
    \ this\n   format, implementors MUST ignore any fields or report types they do\n\
    \   not explicitly support.\n   Additional report types (extension report types)\
    \ or report header\n   fields might be defined in the future by later revisions\
    \ to this\n   specification, or by registrations as described above.  Such types\n\
    \   and fields MUST be registered as described above and published in an\n   Open\
    \ Specification such as an RFC.\n   Experimental report types and report header\
    \ fields MUST only be used\n   between ADMDs that have explicitly consented to\
    \ use them.  These\n   names and the parameters associated with them are not documented\
    \ in\n   RFCs.  Therefore, they are subject to change at any time and are not\n\

  - "8.  Security Considerations\n   The following security considerations apply when\
    \ generating or\n   processing a feedback report:\n"
- title: 8.1.  Inherited from RFC 3462
  contents:
  - "8.1.  Inherited from RFC 3462\n   All of the Security Considerations from [REPORT]\
    \ are inherited here.\n"
- title: 8.2.  Interpretation
  contents:
  - "8.2.  Interpretation\n   This specification describes a report format.  The authentication\
    \ and\n   validity of the content of the report SHOULD be established through\n\
    \   other means.  The content of an unvetted report could be wrong,\n   incomplete\
    \ or deliberately false, including the alleged abuse\n   incident in the third\
    \ part, derived data in the second part or the\n   human-readable first part.\n\
    \   There will be some desire to perform some actions in an automated\n   fashion\
    \ in order to enact timely responses to common feedback\n   reports.  Caution\
    \ must be taken, however, as there is no substantial\n   security around the content\
    \ of these reports.  An attacker could\n   craft a report meant to generate undesirable\
    \ actions on the part of a\n   report recipient.\n   It is suggested that the\
    \ origin of an ARF report be vetted, such as\n   by using common message authentication\
    \ schemes like [SMIME], [DKIM],\n   [SPF], or [SENDERID], prior to the undertaking\
    \ of any kind of\n   automated action in response to receipt of the report.  In\n\
    \   particular, S/MIME offers the strongest authentication and the cost\n   of\
    \ key exchange is assumed in the process of establishing a bilateral\n   reporting\
    \ relationship that uses this specification; however, it is\n   not as transparent\
    \ as the others and thus will interfere with the\n   parsing capabilities of code\
    \ that is designed specifically to handle\n   multipart/report messages.\n   The\
    \ details of the required validation to achieve this are a matter\n   of local\
    \ policy and are thus outside the scope of this specification.\n"
- title: 8.3.  Attacks against Authentication Methods
  contents:
  - "8.3.  Attacks against Authentication Methods\n   If an attack becomes known against\
    \ an authentication method, clearly\n   then the agent verifying that method can\
    \ be fooled into thinking an\n   inauthentic message is authentic, and thus the\
    \ value of this header\n   field can be misleading.  It follows that any attack\
    \ against an\n   authentication method that might be used to protect the authenticity\n\
    \   of an abuse report is also a security consideration here.\n"
- title: 8.4.  Intentionally Malformed Reports
  contents:
  - "8.4.  Intentionally Malformed Reports\n   It is possible for an attacker to generate\
    \ an ARF message field that\n   is extraordinarily large or otherwise malformed\
    \ in an attempt to\n   discover or exploit weaknesses in recipient parsing code.\n\
    \   Implementors SHOULD thoroughly verify all such messages and be robust\n  \
    \ against intentionally as well as unintentionally malformed messages.\n"
- title: 8.5.  Omitting Data from ARF Reports
  contents:
  - "8.5.  Omitting Data from ARF Reports\n   The sending of these reports can reveal\
    \ possibly private information\n   about the person sending the report.  For example,\
    \ such a report sent\n   in response to a mailing list posting will reveal to\
    \ the report\n   recipient a valid email address on the list that might otherwise\
    \ have\n   remained hidden.\n   For this reason, report generators might wish\
    \ to redact portions of\n   the report to conceal private information.  Doing\
    \ so could be\n   necessary where privacy trumps operational necessity, but, as\n\
    \   mentioned in Section 2, it might impede a timely or meaningful\n   response\
    \ from the report recipient.\n"
- title: 8.6.  Automatically Generated ARF Reports
  contents:
  - "8.6.  Automatically Generated ARF Reports\n   Systems have been implemented that\
    \ generate ARF reports automatically\n   in response to an event.  For example,\
    \ software monitoring a honeypot\n   email address might generate an ARF report\
    \ immediately upon delivery\n   of any message to it.  An attacker that becomes\
    \ aware of such a\n   configuration can exploit it to attack an ARF recipient\
    \ with\n   automatically generated ARF reports.\n"
- title: 8.7.  Attached Malware
  contents:
  - "8.7.  Attached Malware\n   As this format is sometimes used to automatically\
    \ report malware, ARF\n   processors (human or otherwise) SHOULD ensure that attachments\
    \ are\n   processed in a manner appropriate for unverified and potentially\n \
    \  hostile data.\n"
- title: 8.8.  The User-Agent Field
  contents:
  - "8.8.  The User-Agent Field\n   Further to Section 8.2, the User-Agent field is\
    \ an assertion of the\n   generating software and is neither specified in this\
    \ memo nor derived\n   from the message represented in the third part of the report.\
    \  It is\n   intended for documentation and debugging, and since it is trivially\n\
    \   forged by a malicious agent, it SHOULD NOT be interpreted by\n   recipients.\n"
- title: 8.9.  Malformed Messages
  contents:
  - "8.9.  Malformed Messages\n   Further to the discussion in Section 4, there might\
    \ be cases where an\n   ARF processing agent elects to accept messages not consistent\
    \ with\n   this specification, such as during transition periods where some\n\
    \   fields are moving toward \"historic\" or \"deprecated\" status, or the\n \
    \  introduction of new non-standard extension or experimental fields.\n   Such\
    \ choices need to be implemented with extreme caution; where two\n   different\
    \ fields have related meaning (e.g., \"Received-Date\", which\n   is historic,\
    \ and \"Arrival-Date\", which is current), an attacker could\n   craft a report\
    \ that makes a confusing claim in an attempt to exploit\n   such liberal parsing\
    \ logic.\n"
