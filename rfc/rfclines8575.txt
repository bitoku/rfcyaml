Abstract This document defines a YANG data model for the configuration of devices and clocks using the Precision Time Protocol (PTP) as specified in IEEE Std 1588 2008.
It also defines the retrieval of the configuration information, the data sets and the running states of PTP clocks.
The YANG module in this document conforms to the Network Management Datastore Architecture (NMDA).
As a synchronization protocol, IEEE Std 1588 2008
[IEEE1588] is widely supported in the carrier networks, industrial networks, automotive networks, and many other applications.
It can provide high precision time synchronization as fine as nanoseconds.
The protocol depends on a Precision Time Protocol (PTP) engine to decide its own state automatically, and a PTP transportation layer to carry the PTP timing and various quality messages.
The configuration parameters and state data sets of IEEE Std 1588 2008 are numerous.
According to the concepts described in [RFC3444], IEEE Std 1588 2008 itself provides an information model in its normative specifications for the data sets (in IEEE Std 1588 2008 clause 8).
Some standardization organizations, including the IETF, have specified data models in MIBs
(Management Information Bases) for IEEE Std 1588 2008 data sets (e.g., [RFC8173] and [IEEE8021AS]).
These MIBs are typically focused on retrieval of state data using the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP); furthermore, configuration of PTP data sets is not considered in [RFC8173].
Some service providers and applications require that the management of the IEEE Std 1588 2008 synchronization network be flexible and more Internet based (typically overlaid on their transport networks).
Software Defined Networking (SDN) is another driving factor, which demands an improved configuration capability of synchronization networks.
YANG [RFC7950] is a data modeling language used to model configuration and state data manipulated by network management protocols like the Network Configuration Protocol (NETCONF) [RFC6241].
A small set of built in data types is defined in [RFC7950]; a collection of common data types is also defined in [RFC6991].
Advantages of YANG include Internet based configuration capabilities, validation, rollback, and so on.
All of these characteristics make it attractive to become another candidate modeling language for IEEE Std 1588 2008.
This document defines a YANG data model for the configuration of IEEE Std 1588 2008 devices and clocks as well as retrieval of the state data of IEEE Std 1588 2008 clocks.
The data model is based on the PTP data sets as specified in [IEEE1588].
The technology specific PTP information (e.g., those specifically implemented by a bridge, a router, or a telecom profile) is out of scope of this document.
The YANG module in this document conforms to the Network Management Datastore Architecture (NMDA) [RFC8342].
When used in practice, network products in support of synchronization typically conform to one or more IEEE Std 1588 2008 profiles.
Each profile specifies how IEEE Std 1588 2008 is used in a given industry (e.g., telecom or automotive) and application.
A profile can require features that are optional in IEEE Std 1588 2008, and it can specify new features that use IEEE Std 1588 2008 as a foundation.
The readers are assumed to be familiar with IEEE Std 1588 2008.
It is expected that the IEEE Std 1588 2008 YANG module will be used as follows:
2008 YANG module can be used as is for products that conform to one of the default profiles specified in IEEE Std 1588 2008.
When the IEEE Std 1588 standard is revised (e.g., the IEEE Std 1588 revision in progress at the time of writing this document), it will add some new optional features to its data sets.
The YANG module of this document can be revised and extended to support these new features.
Moreover, the YANG "revision" MUST be used to indicate changes to the YANG module under such a circumstance.
A profile standard based on IEEE Std 1588 2008 may create a dedicated YANG module for its profile.
The profile's YANG module SHOULD use YANG "import" to import the IEEE Std 1588 2008 YANG module as its foundation.
Then the profile's YANG module SHOULD use YANG "augment" to add any profile specific enhancements.
A product that conforms to a profile standard may also create its own YANG module.
The product's YANG module SHOULD "import" the profile's module, and then use YANG "augment" to add any product  specific enhancements.

2008 YANG Data Model Hierarchy
This section describes the hierarchy of a YANG module for IEEE Std 1588 2008; specifically, query and configuration of device wide or port specific configuration information and clock data sets are described.
Query and configuration of clock information include: (Note: The attribute names are consistent with IEEE Std 1588 2008, but changed to the YANG style, i.e., using all lowercase, with dashes between words.)
Clock data set attributes in a clock node, including the following: current ds, parent ds, default ds, time properties ds, and transparent clock default
Port specific data set attributes, including the following: port ds and transparent clock port ds.
As all PTP terminology and PTP data set attributes are described in detail in IEEE Std 1588 2008, this document only outlines each of them in the YANG module.
A simplified YANG tree diagram [RFC8340] representing the data model is typically used by YANG modules.
This document uses the same tree diagram syntax as described in [RFC8340].
rw offset scaled log variance?
rw offset scaled log variance?
rw transparent clock port ds list
[port number]  rw port number
rw log min pdelay req interval?
rw peer mean path delay?
The preceding model and the associated YANG module have some subtle differences from the data set specifications of IEEE Std 1588 2008.
These differences are based on interpretation from the IEEE 1588 Working Group, and they are intended to provide compatibility with future revisions of the IEEE Std 1588 standard.
In IEEE Std 1588 2008, a physical product can implement multiple PTP clocks (i.e., an ordinary, boundary, or transparent clock).
As specified in IEEE Std 1588
2008 subclause 7.1, each of the multiple clocks operates in an independent domain.
However, the organization of multiple PTP domains was not clear in the data sets of IEEE Std 1588 2008.
This document introduces the concept of a PTP instance, which is a PTP implementation in a device (i.e., an OC or BC) represented by a specific PTP data set.
Each instance operates in exactly one domain.
The instance concept is used exclusively to allow for optional support of multiple domains.
The instance number has no usage within PTP messages.
Based on statements in IEEE Std 1588 2008 subclauses 8.3.1 and 10.1, most transparent clock products have interpreted the transparent clock data sets to reside as a singleton at the root level of the managed product, and this YANG data model reflects that location.
The information model of IEEE Std 1588 2008 classifies each member in PTP data sets as one of the following:
Read only to management, and the value is changed by PTP protocol operation.
For details on the classification of each PTP data set member, refer to the specification of that member in IEEE Std 1588 2008.
Under certain circumstances, the classification of an IEEE Std 1588 data set member may change for a YANG implementation, for example, a configurable member needs to be changed to read only.
In such a case, an implementation SHOULD choose to return a warning upon writing to a read only member or use the deviation mechanism to develop a new deviation model as described in Section 7.20.3 of [RFC7950].
This module imports typedef "interface ref" from [RFC8343].
Most attributes are based on the information model defined in [IEEE1588], but their names are adapted to the YANG style of naming.

The YANG module specified in this document defines a schema for data that is designed to be accessed via network management protocols such as NETCONF [RFC6241] or RESTCONF [RFC8040].
The lowest NETCONF layer is the secure transport layer, and the mandatory to implement secure transport is Secure Shell (SSH) [RFC6242].
The lowest RESTCONF layer is HTTPS, and the mandatory to implement secure transport is TLS [RFC8446].
Furthermore, general security considerations of time protocols are discussed in [RFC7384].
The Network Configuration Access Control Model (NACM)
[RFC8341] provides the means to restrict access for particular NETCONF or RESTCONF users to a preconfigured subset of all available NETCONF or RESTCONF protocol operations and content.
There are a number of data nodes defined in this YANG module that are writable, and the involved subtrees that are sensitive include: /ptp/instance list specifies an instance (i.e., PTP data sets) for an OC or BC. /ptp
/transparent clock default ds specifies a default data set for a TC.
/transparent clock port ds list specifies a list of port data sets for a TC.
Write operations (e.g., edit config) to these data nodes without proper protection can have a negative effect on network operations.
Specifically, an inappropriate configuration of them may adversely impact a PTP synchronization network.
For example, loss of synchronization on a clock, accuracy degradation on a set of clocks, or even break down of a whole synchronization network.

Transferring YANG Work to the IEEE 1588 WG
This appendix describes a future plan to transition responsibility for IEEE Std
1588 YANG modules from the IETF TICTOC Working Group (WG) to the IEEE 1588 WG, which develops the time synchronization technology that the YANG modules are designed to manage.
This appendix is forward looking with regard to future standardization roadmaps in the IETF and IEEE.
Since those roadmaps cannot be predicted with significant accuracy, this appendix is informational, and it does not specify imperatives or normative specifications of any kind.
2008 YANG module of this standard represents a cooperation between the IETF (for YANG) and IEEE (for 1588).
For the initial standardization of IEEE 1588 YANG modules, the information model is relatively clear (i.e., IEEE Std 1588 data sets), but expertise in YANG is required, making IETF an appropriate location for the standards.
The TICTOC WG has expertise with IEEE Std 1588, making it the appropriate location within the IETF.
The IEEE 1588 WG anticipates future changes to its standard on an ongoing basis.
As IEEE 1588 WG members gain practical expertise with YANG, the IEEE 1588 WG will become more appropriate for standardization of its YANG modules.
As the IEEE 1588 standard is revised and/or amended, IEEE 1588 members can more effectively synchronize the revision of this YANG module with future versions of the IEEE 1588 standard.
This appendix is meant to establish some clear expectations between IETF and IEEE about the future transfer of IEEE 1588 YANG modules to the IEEE 1588 WG.
The goal is to assist in making the future transfer as smooth as possible.
As the transfer takes place, some case by case situations are likely to arise, which can be handled by discussion on the IETF TICTOC WG mailing lists and/or appropriate liaisons.
This appendix obtained insight from [RFC4663], an informational memo that described a similar transfer of MIB work from the IETF Bridge MIB WG to the IEEE 802.1 WG.
Assumptions for the Transfer For the purposes of discussion in this appendix, assume that the IESG has approved the publication of an RFC containing a YANG module for a published IEEE 1588 standard.
As of this writing, this is IEEE Std 1588 2008, but it is possible that YANG modules for subsequent 1588 revisions could be published from the IETF TICTOC WG.
For discussion in this appendix, we use the phrase "last IETF 1588 YANG" to refer to the most recently published 1588 YANG module from the IETF TICTOC WG.
The IEEE SA Standards Board New Standards Committee (NesCom) handles new Project Authorization Requests (PARs) (see <http://standards.ieee.org/board/nes/>).
PARs are roughly the equivalent of IETF Working Group Charters and include information concerning the scope, purpose, and justification for standardization projects.
Assume that IEEE 1588 has an approved PAR that explicitly specifies development of a YANG module.
The transfer of YANG work will occur in the context of this IEEE 1588 PAR.
For discussion in this appendix, we use the phrase "first IEEE 1588 YANG" to refer to the first IEEE 1588 standard for YANG.
Assume that as part of the transfer of YANG work, the IETF TICTOC WG agrees to cease all work on standard YANG modules for IEEE 1588.
Assume that the IEEE 1588 WG has participated in the development of the last IETF 1588 YANG module, such that the first IEEE 1588 YANG module will effectively be a revision of it.
In other words, the transfer of YANG work will be relatively clean.
The actual conditions for the future transfer can be such that the preceding assumptions do not hold.
Exceptions to the assumptions will need to be addressed on a case by case basis at the time of the transfer.
This appendix describes topics that can be addressed based on the preceding assumptions.
As specified in Section 5 "IANA Considerations", the YANG module in this document uses IETF as the root of its URN namespace and YANG module name.
Use of IETF as the root of these names implies that the YANG module is standardized in a Working Group of IETF, using the IETF processes.
If the IEEE 1588 Working Group were to continue using these names rooted in IETF, the IEEE 1588 YANG standardization would need to continue in the IETF.
The goal of transferring the YANG work is to avoid this sort of dependency between standards organizations.
IEEE 802 has an active PAR (IEEE P802d) for creating a URN namespace for IEEE use (see <http://standards.ieee.org/develop/ project/802d.html>).
It is likely that this IEEE 802 PAR will be approved and published prior to the transfer of YANG work to the IEEE 1588 WG.
If so, the IEEE 1588 WG can use the IEEE URN namespace for the first IEEE 1588 YANG module, such as: urn:ieee:Std:1588:
yang:ieee1588 ptp where "ieee1588 ptp" is the registered YANG module name in the IEEE.
Under the assumptions of Appendix A.1, the first IEEE 1588 YANG module's prefix will be the same as the last IETF 1588 YANG module's prefix (i.e., "ptp").
Consequently, other YANG modules can preserve the same import prefix "ptp" to access PTP nodes during the migration from the last IETF 1588 YANG module to the first IEEE 1588 YANG module.
The result of these name changes are that for complete compatibility, a server (i.e., IEEE 1588 node) can choose to implement a YANG module for the last IETF 1588 YANG module (with IETF root) as well as the first IEEE 1588 YANG module (with IEEE root).
Since the content of the YANG module transferred are the same, the server implementation is effectively common for both.
From a client's perspective, a client of the last IETF 1588 YANG module (or earlier) looks for the IETF rooted module name; and a client of the first IEEE 1588 YANG module (or later) looks for the IEEE rooted module name.
YANG Modules in ASCII Format
Although IEEE 1588 can certainly decide to publish YANG modules only in the PDF format that they use for their standard documents, without publishing an ASCII version, most network management systems cannot import the YANG module directly from the PDF.
Thus, not publishing an ASCII version of the YANG module would negatively impact implementers and deployers of YANG modules and would make potential IETF reviews of YANG modules more difficult.
This appendix recommends that the IEEE 1588 WG consider future plans for:  Public availability of the ASCII YANG modules during project development.
These ASCII files allow IETF participants to access these documents for pre standard review purposes.
Public availability of the YANG portion of published IEEE 1588 standards, provided as an ASCII file for each YANG module.
These ASCII files are intended for use of the published IEEE 1588 standard.
As an example of public availability during project development, IEEE 802 uses the same repository that IETF uses for YANG module development (see <https://github.com/YangModels/yang>).
IEEE branches are provided for experimental work (i.e., pre PAR) as well as standard work (post PAR drafts).
IEEE SA has approved use of this repository for project development, but not for published standards.
As an example of public availability of YANG modules for published standards, IEEE 802.1 provides a public list of ASCII files for MIB (see <http://www.ieee802.org/1/files/public/MIBs/> and <http://www.ieee802.org/1/pages/MIBS.html>), and analogous lists are planned for IEEE 802.1 YANG files.
