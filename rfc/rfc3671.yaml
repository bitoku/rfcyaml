  - "Abstract\n   X.500 collective attributes allow common characteristics to be shared\n
    \  between collections of entries.  This document summarizes the X.500\n   information
    model for collective attributes and describes use of\n   collective attributes
    in LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access\n   Protocol).  This document provides schema
    definitions for collective\n   attributes for use in LDAP.\n"
  title: Abstract
- contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   In X.500 [X.500], a collective attribute is \"a user attribute
    whose\n   values are the same for each member of an entry collection\" [X.501].\n
    \  This document details their use in the Lightweight Directory Access\n   Protocol
    (LDAP) [RFC3377].\n"
  - contents:
    - "1.1.  Entry Collections\n   A collection of entries is a grouping of object
      and alias entries\n   based upon common properties or shared relationship between
      the\n   corresponding entries which share certain attributes.  An entry\n   collection
      consists of all entries within scope of a collective\n   attributes subentry
      [RFC3672].  An entry can belong to several entry\n   collections.\n"
    title: 1.1.  Entry Collections
  - contents:
    - "1.2.  Collective Attributes\n   Attributes shared by the entries comprising
      an entry collection are\n   called collective attributes.  Values of collective
      attributes are\n   visible but not updateable to clients accessing entries within
      the\n   collection.  Collective attributes are updated (i.e., modified) via\n
      \  their associated collective attributes subentry.\n   When an entry belongs
      to multiple entry collections, the entry's\n   values of each collective attribute
      are combined such that\n   independent sources of these values are not manifested
      to clients.\n   Entries can specifically exclude a particular collective attribute
      by\n   listing the attribute as a value of the collectiveExclusions\n   attribute.
      \ Like other user attributes, collective attributes are\n   subject to a variety
      of controls including access, administrative,\n   and content controls.\n"

      subentries.\n      ( 2.5.17.2 NAME 'collectiveAttributeSubentry' AUXILIARY )\n
      \  A collective attribute subentry SHOULD contain at least one\n   collective
      attribute.  The collective attributes contained within a\n   collective attribute
      subentry are available for finding, searching,\n   and comparison at every entry

    \  collectiveExclusions attribute and other administrative controls.\n   These
    administrative controls MAY include DIT Content Rules, if\n   implemented.\n   Collective
    attribute types are commonly defined as subtypes of non-\n   collective attribute
    types.  By convention, collective attributes are\n   named by prefixing the name
    of their non-collective supertype with\n   \"c-\".  For example, the collective
    telephone attribute is named\n   c-TelephoneNumber after its non-collective supertype
    telephoneNumber.\n   Non-collective attributes types SHALL NOT subtype collective\n
    \  attributes.\n   Collective attributes SHALL NOT be SINGLE-VALUED.  Collective\n
