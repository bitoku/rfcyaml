- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   The Authentication Header (AH) [RFC-1826] provides integrity\
    \ and\n   authentication for IP datagrams.  This specification describes the AH\n\
    \   use of keys with Message Digest 5 (MD5) [RFC-1321].\n   All implementations\
    \ that claim conformance or compliance with the\n   Authentication Header specification\
    \ MUST implement this keyed MD5\n   mechanism.\n   This document assumes that\
    \ the reader is familiar with the related\n   document \"Security Architecture\
    \ for the Internet Protocol\" [RFC-\n   1825], which defines the overall security\
    \ plan for IP, and provides\n   important background for this specification.\n"
- title: 1.1.  Keys
  contents:
  - "1.1.  Keys\n   The secret authentication key shared between the communicating\n\
    \   parties SHOULD be a cryptographically strong random number, not a\n   guessable\
    \ string of any sort.\n   The shared key is not constrained by this transform\
    \ to any particular\n   size.  Lengths of up to 128 bits MUST be supported by\
    \ the\n   implementation, although any particular key may be shorter.  Longer\n\
    \   keys are encouraged.\n"
- title: 1.2.  Data Size
  contents:
  - "1.2.  Data Size\n   MD5's 128-bit output is naturally 64-bit aligned.  Typically,\
    \ there\n   is no further padding of the Authentication Data field.\n"
- title: 1.3.  Performance
  contents:
  - "1.3.  Performance\n   MD5 software speeds are adequate for commonly deployed\
    \ LAN and WAN\n   links, but reportedly are too slow for newer link technologies\
    \ [RFC-\n   1810].\n   Nota Bene:\n      Suggestions are sought on alternative\
    \ authentication algorithms\n      that have significantly faster throughput,\
    \ are not patent-\n      encumbered, and still retain adequate cryptographic strength.\n"
- title: 2.  Calculation
  contents:
  - "2.  Calculation\n   The 128-bit digest is calculated as described in [RFC-1321].\
    \  The\n   specification of MD5 includes a portable 'C' programming language\n\
    \   description of the MD5 algorithm.\n   The form of the authenticated message\
    \ is\n            key, keyfill, datagram, key, MD5fill\n   First, the variable\
    \ length secret authentication key is filled to the\n   next 512-bit boundary,\
    \ using the same pad with length technique\n   defined for MD5.\n   Then, the\
    \ filled key is concatenated with (immediately followed by)\n   the invariant\
    \ fields of the entire IP datagram (variant fields are\n   zeroed), concatenated\
    \ with (immediately followed by) the original\n   variable length key again.\n\
    \   A trailing pad with length to the next 512-bit boundary for the\n   entire\
    \ message is added by MD5 itself.  The 128-bit MD5 digest is\n   calculated, and\
    \ the result is inserted into the Authentication Data\n   field.\n   Discussion:\n\
    \      When the implementation adds the keys and padding in place before\n   \
    \   and after the IP datagram, care must be taken that the keys and/or\n     \
    \ padding are not sent over the link by the link driver.\n"
- title: Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "Security Considerations\n   Users need to understand that the quality of the\
    \ security provided by\n   this specification depends completely on the strength\
    \ of the MD5 hash\n   function, the correctness of that algorithm's implementation,\
    \ the\n   security of the key management mechanism and its implementation, the\n\
    \   strength of the key [CN94], and upon the correctness of the\n   implementations\
    \ in all of the participating nodes.\n   At the time of writing of this document,\
    \ it is known to be possible\n   to produce collisions in the compression function\
    \ of MD5 [dBB93].\n   There is not yet a known method to exploit these collisions\
    \ to attack\n   MD5 in practice, but this fact is disturbing to some authors\n\
    \   [Schneier94].\n   It has also recently been determined [vOW94] that it is\
    \ possible to\n   build a machine for $10 Million that could find two chosen text\n\
    \   variants with a common MD5 hash value.  However, it is unclear\n   whether\
    \ this attack is applicable to a keyed MD5 transform.\n   This attack requires\
    \ approximately 24 days.  The same form of attack\n   is useful on any iterated\
    \ n-bit hash function, and the time is\n   entirely due to the 128-bit length\
    \ of the MD5 hash.\n   Although there is no substantial weakness for most IP security\n\
    \   applications, it should be recognized that current technology is\n   catching\
    \ up to the 128-bit hash length used by MD5.  Applications\n   requiring extremely\
    \ high levels of security may wish to move in the\n   near future to algorithms\
    \ with longer hash lengths.\n"
