  contents:
  - "Abstract\n   This document reorganizes the IANA registries for the type values\
    \ and\n   sub-type values of the BGP Extended Communities attribute and the BGP\n\
    \   IPv6-Address-Specific Extended Communities attribute.  This is done\n   in\
    \ order to remove interdependencies among the registries, thus\n   making it easier\
    \ for IANA to determine which codepoints are available\n   for assignment in which\
    \ registries.  This document also clarifies the\n   information that must be provided\
    \ to IANA when requesting an\n   allocation from one or more of these registries.\
    \  These changes are\n   compatible with the existing allocations and thus do\
    \ not affect\n   protocol implementations.  The changes will, however, impact\
    \ the\n   \"IANA Considerations\" sections of future protocol specifications.\n\
    \   This document updates RFC 4360 and RFC 5701.\n"

- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   RFC 4360 [RFC4360] defines the BGP \"Extended Communities\"\
    \ (EC)\n   attribute.  This attribute consists of a sequence of eight-octet\n\
    \   \"extended communities\".  The high-order octet is defined to be the\n   \"\
    Type\" field.  Each Type has a range of values for \"Transitive\n   Extended Community\
    \ Types\" and a range of values for \"Non-transitive\n   Extended Community Types\"\
    .  Some of these ranges are further\n   subdivided into a sub-range of values\
    \ to be assigned by IANA under\n   the \"Standards Action\" policy, a sub-range\
    \ of values to be assigned\n   by IANA under the \"First Come First Served\" policy,\
    \ and a sub-range\n   for \"experimental use\".  (See [RFC5226], [RFC7120], and\
    \ [RFC3692] for\n   an explanation of these policies.)\n   For some Extended Community\
    \ Types, the second octet of the Extended\n   Community is a \"Sub-Type\" field,\
    \ and the remaining six octets are the\n   \"Value\" field.  These are referred\
    \ to as \"Extended Types\".  For other\n   types, there is no \"Sub-Type\" field,\
    \ and the \"Value\" field contains\n   seven octets.  These are referred to as\
    \ \"Regular Types\".\n   RFC 4360 is not very specific about how the IANA registries\
    \ for\n   Extended Community Types and/or Sub-Types are to be organized, and\n\
    \   this has led to some confusion.  The purpose of this document is to\n   reorganize\
    \ the registries to make the IANA codepoint allocation task\n   more straightforward.\n"
- title: 2.  Types, Sub-Types, and Registries
  contents:
  - "2.  Types, Sub-Types, and Registries\n   The high-order octet of an Extended\
    \ Community will be known as the\n   \"Type\" field.\n   There will be one IANA\
    \ registry for \"Transitive Extended Community\n   Types\" (see Section 5.1.1)\
    \ and one for \"Non-transitive Extended\n   Community Types\" (Section 5.1.2).\
    \  Each registry specifies three\n   ranges, and each range is associated with\
    \ a particular IANA\n   allocation policy.\n   There will be a set of IANA registries\
    \ for Extended Community\n   Sub-Types (see Section 5.2).  Each such registry\
    \ will have a range of\n   0x00-0xFF.  Values in the range 0x00-0xBF are assignable\
    \ by IANA\n   according to the \"First Come First Served\" allocation policy of\n\
    \   [RFC5226].  Values in the range 0xC0-0xFF are assignable by IANA\n   according\
    \ to the \"IETF Review\" allocation policy of [RFC5226].\n   If a particular Type\
    \ has Sub-Types, that Type's entry in its Type\n   registry identifies its Sub-Type\
    \ registry.  Note that some Types do\n   not have Sub-Types.  When the request\
    \ is made to establish a new Type\n   registry, the request must specify whether\
    \ or not there is to be a\n   Sub-Type registry associated with that Type.\n \
    \  Whether a given Type has Sub-Types is determined when the Type is\n   initially\
    \ defined; this cannot be changed later.\n"
- title: 3.  Applicability to IPv6-Address-Specific EC Attribute
  contents:
  - "3.  Applicability to IPv6-Address-Specific EC Attribute\n   RFC 5701 [RFC5701]\
    \ defines the IPv6-Address-Specific Extended\n   Community to be a 20-octet quantity\
    \ whose high-order two octets may\n   be considered to be the \"Type\" field.\
    \  The high-order octet is either\n   0x00, indicating a transitive Extended Community;\
    \ or 0x40, indicating\n   a Non-transitive Extended Community.  The second octet\
    \ is said to be\n   a \"Sub-Type\", and it is suggested that the Sub-Types are\
    \ the same as\n   the Sub-Types for the IPv4-Address-Specific Extended Community.\n\
    \   However, the existing IANA codepoint allocations for this octet do\n   not\
    \ always match the corresponding allocations for the\n   IPv4-Address-Specific\
    \ Extended Community Sub-Types.\n   This document modifies RFC 5701 by removing\
    \ any requirement for the\n   values of the second octet of the IPv6-Address-Specific\
    \ Extended\n   Community Type codepoints to match the codepoints in either of\
    \ the\n   IPv4-Address-Specific Sub-Types registries.\n   This document requests\
    \ IANA to create two IPv6-Address-Specific\n   Extended Community registries --\
    \ one for transitive communities and\n   one for non-transitive communities. \
    \ See Section 5.3.\n"
- title: 4.  How to Request EC Type and/or Sub-Type Codepoints
  contents:
  - "4.  How to Request EC Type and/or Sub-Type Codepoints\n   When a codepoint is\
    \ needed for a new Extended Community, the\n   requester should first determine\
    \ whether an existing Type can be\n   used.  If so, IANA should be asked to allocate\
    \ a codepoint from the\n   corresponding Sub-Type registry, if there is one.\n\
    \   If a new Extended Community Type is needed, the requester should ask\n   IANA\
    \ to allocate a new type from the \"BGP Transitive Extended\n   Community Types\"\
    \ registry, the \"BGP Non-Transitive Extended Community\n   Types\" registry,\
    \ or both.  It is up to the requester to state whether\n   an allocation is needed\
    \ from one or both of these registries.  When\n   an allocation from both registries\
    \ is requested, the requester may\n   find it desirable for both allocations to\
    \ share the same low-order\n   six bits.  If so, it is the responsibility of the\
    \ requester to\n   explicitly request this of IANA.\n   Of course, any request\
    \ for a codepoint from a particular registry\n   must follow the defined registration\
    \ procedures for that registry.\n   If a new Extended Community Type is needed\
    \ and the new Type is to\n   have Sub-Types, the requester should specify whether\
    \ an existing\n   Sub-Type registry can be used for the new Type or a new Sub-Type\n\
    \   registry is needed.  (At the current time, every Type that has\n   Sub-Types\
    \ is associated with a unique Sub-Type registry.  It is\n   possible that in the\
    \ future a new Type registry may be created that\n   is associated with a pre-existing\
    \ Sub-Type registry.)  In either\n   case, if a new Sub-Type value needs to be\
    \ allocated from a particular\n   Sub-Type registry, the request should explicitly\
    \ identify the\n   registry.\n   If the creation of a new Sub-Type registry is\
    \ requested, the range of\n   values is always 0x00-0xFF.  It is recommended that\
    \ the allocation\n   policy described in Section 2 be used, i.e., 0x00-0xBF to\
    \ be\n   allocated by IANA under the \"First Come First Served\" policy and\n\
    \   0xC0-0xFF to be allocated by IANA under the \"IETF Review\" policy.\n   Commonly,\
    \ a new Extended Community is defined such that it can be of\n   several Types.\
    \  For example, one may want to define a new Extended\n   Community so that it\
    \ can be either transitive or non-transitive,\n   either the two-octet AS Number\
    \ Type or the four-octet AS Number Type,\n   etc.  The requester is responsible\
    \ for explicitly asking IANA to\n   allocate codepoints in all the necessary Type\
    \ and/or Sub-Type\n   registries.\n   When a new Extended Community is defined,\
    \ it may be necessary to ask\n   IANA to allocate codepoints in several Sub-Type\
    \ registries.  In this\n   case, it is a common practice to ask IANA to allocate\
    \ the same\n   codepoint value in each registry.  If this is desired, it is the\n\
    \   responsibility of the requester to explicitly ask IANA to allocate\n   the\
    \ same value in each registry.\n   When a new Extended Community Sub-Type codepoint\
    \ is allocated, it may\n   also be desirable to allocate a corresponding value\
    \ in one or both of\n   the IPv6-Address-Specific Extended Community registries.\
    \  The\n   requester is responsible for requesting this allocation explicitly.\n\
    \   If the requester would like the same numerical value to be allocated\n   in\
    \ an IPv6-Address-Specific Extended Community registry that is\n   allocated in\
    \ some other registry, it is the responsibility of the\n   requester to explicitly\
    \ ask this of IANA.\n"
- title: 5.  IANA Considerations
  contents:
  - "5.  IANA Considerations\n   IANA has replaced the pre-existing BGP Extended Communities\n\
    \   registries with the registries described in this section.\n   The registries\
    \ reproduced below do not include the \"references\" or\n   \"date\" fields for\
    \ the individual codepoints in the registries,\n   because it is difficult to\
    \ incorporate those within the 72-character\n   line limitation of RFCs.  The\
    \ references and associated dates have\n   been copied from the existing registries\
    \ when creating the new\n   registries; the authors have worked with IANA to ensure\
    \ that this\n   information has been carried over correctly to the reorganized\n\
    \   registry.  As this document does not change the usage or semantics of\n  \
    \ any of the codepoints, the references associated with the individual\n   codepoints\
    \ do not change.\n   On the other hand, the references for each of the registries\
    \ defined\n   in this section have been changed to refer to this document.\n"
