- title: 1.  The SNMP Network Management Framework
  contents:
  - "1.  The SNMP Network Management Framework\n   The SNMP Network Management Framework\
    \ presently consists of five\n   major components:\n    o   An overall architecture,\
    \ described in RFC 2571 [1].\n    o   Mechanisms for describing and naming objects\
    \ and events for the\n        purpose of management. The first version of this\
    \ Structure of\n        Management Information (SMI) is called SMIv1 and described\
    \ in\n        STD 16, RFC 1155 [2], STD 16, RFC 1212 [3] and RFC 1215 [4]. The\n\
    \        second version, called SMIv2, is described in STD 58, RFC 2578\n    \
    \    [5], RFC 2579 [6] and RFC 2580 [7].\n    o   Message protocols for transferring\
    \ management information. The\n        first version of the SNMP message protocol\
    \ is called SNMPv1 and\n        described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [8]. A second version\
    \ of the SNMP\n        message protocol, which is not an Internet standards track\n\
    \        protocol, is called SNMPv2c and described in RFC 1901 [9] and\n     \
    \   RFC 1906 [10].  The third version of the message protocol is\n        called\
    \ SNMPv3 and described in RFC 1906 [10], RFC 2572 [11] and\n        RFC 2574 [12].\n\
    \    o   Protocol operations for accessing management information. The\n     \
    \   first set of protocol operations and associated PDU formats is\n        described\
    \ in STD 15, RFC 1157 [8]. A second set of protocol\n        operations and associated\
    \ PDU formats is described in RFC 1905\n        [13].\n    o   A set of fundamental\
    \ applications described in RFC 2573 [14] and\n        the view-based access control\
    \ mechanism described in RFC 2575\n        [15].\n   Managed objects are accessed\
    \ via a virtual information store, termed\n   the Management Information Base\
    \ or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are\n   defined using the mechanisms defined in\
    \ the SMI.\n   This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2.\
    \ A\n   MIB conforming to the SMIv1 can be produced through the appropriate\n\
    \   translations. The resulting translated MIB must be semantically\n   equivalent,\
    \ except where objects or events are omitted because no\n   translation is possible\
    \ (use of Counter64). Some machine readable\n   information in SMIv2 will be converted\
    \ into textual descriptions in\n   SMIv1 during the translation process. However,\
    \ this loss of machine\n   readable information is not considered to change the\
    \ semantics of the\n   MIB.\n"
- title: 2.  The Directory Services Model.
  contents:
  - "2.  The Directory Services Model.\n   The Directory comprises of a set of servers\
    \ (Directory Servers).\n   Clients or Directory User Agents (DUA) are provided\
    \ access to the\n   Directory which maybe local or distributed, by the Directory\
    \ Servers.\n   The server maybe a X.500 Directory System Agent (DSA) [16] running\n\
    \   over the OSI suite of protocols or, a (C)LDAP[17,18] frontend to the\n   X.500\
    \ Directory System Agent or, a native LDAP Directory Server\n   running directly\
    \ over TCP or other protocols, or a database acting as\n   a backend to another\
    \ server,  or any other application protocol, or\n   any combination of the above.\
    \ A Directory Server has one or more\n   application protocol interfaces.  Through\
    \ these interfaces the\n   Directory Server interacts with the DUA and with the\
    \ peer Directory\n   Servers.\n   Fig. 1 shows the case of a Directory Server\
    \ that receives requests\n   and sends back responses in some protocol. Fig. 2\
    \ shows one possible\n   scenario where the Directory Server speaks multiple protocols.\n\

    \                  FIG. 2.\n   The Directory contains information in the form\
    \ of entries. An entry\n   is a collection of attributes and is uniquely identified\
    \ by a name,\n   the Distinguished Name (DN). The entries are arranged in a\n\
    \   hierarchical tree-like structure called the Directory Information\n   Tree\
    \ (DIT).\n   A DUA requests a Directory Server to perform some operation on the\n\
    \   Directory. The Directory Server is responsible for performing the\n   operation\
    \ and after completing its effort to carry out the request,\n   returns a response\
    \ to the DUA.\n   A Directory Server may use information stored in its local database\n\
    \   or interact with (chain the request to) other Directory Servers to\n   service\
    \ the DUA request. Alternatively, a Directory Server may return\n   a reference\
    \ to another Directory Server (referral).\n   The local database of a Directory\
    \ Server consists of the part of the\n   Directory that is mastered by the Directory\
    \ Server, the part of the\n   Directory for which it keeps slave copies and cached\
    \ information that\n   is gathered during the operation of the Directory Server.\n\
    \   In the connection oriented mode a DUA \"binds\" to a Directory Server\n  \
    \ with a particular identification. The Directory Server may\n   authenticate\
    \ the identity of the DUA. In the connectionless mode as\n   is employed in CLDAP\
    \ no binding and/or authentication is carried out\n   between the DUA and the\
    \ Directory Server.  The following type of\n   operations are carried out by the\
    \ Directory Server : Read, Compare,\n   Addition of an Entry (AddEntry), Modification\
    \ of an Entry\n   (ModifyEntry), Modification of a DN (ModifyRDN), Deletion of\
    \ an Entry\n   (RemoveEntry), List, Search, Abandon. Some Directory Servers do\
    \ not\n   support some type of operations. For example CLDAP does not support\n\
    \   AddEntry, ModifyEntry, ModifyRDN, RemoveEntry etc.  In response to\n   requests\
    \ results and/or errors are returned by the Directory Server.\n   In the distributed\
    \ Directory data is often replicated to enhance\n   performance and for other\
    \ advantages. The data to be replicated is\n   transferred from the \"Supplier\"\
    \ Directory Server to the \"Consumer\"\n   Directory Server according to the replication\
    \ agreement between the\n   supplier and the receiver.\n"
- title: 3.  MIB Model for  Directory  Management.
  contents:
  - "3.  MIB Model for  Directory  Management.\n   A Directory manager should be able\
    \ to monitor all the Directory\n   Servers in his/her domain of management. The\
    \ Directory Servers may be\n   running on one or more hosts and, multiple Directory\
    \ Servers may be\n   running on the same host.\n   The manager may wish to monitor\
    \ several aspects of the operational\n   Directory Servers. He/she may want to\
    \ know the process related\n   aspects - the resource utilization of an operational\
    \ Directory\n   Server; the network service related aspects e.g. inbound-\n  \
    \ associations, outbound-associations, operational status, and finally\n   the\
    \ information specific to the Directory Server application - its\n   operations\
    \ and performance.\n   The MIB defined in this document covers the portion which\
    \ is specific\n   to Directory services. The network service related part of the\
    \ MIB,\n   and the host-resources related part of the MIB, as well as other\n\
    \   parts of interest to a Manager monitoring the Directory services, are\n  \
    \ covered in separate documents [19] [20].\n   The MIB will cover a group of Directory\
    \ Servers. The grouping will be\n   done on some logical basis by the administrator/manager.\
    \  In all\n   cases, the grouping will be reflected in the pertinent NETWORK-\n\
    \   SERVICES-MIB which will have an entry corresponding to each Directory\n  \
    \ Server in the group.\n"
- title: 4.  MIB design.
  contents:
  - "4.  MIB design.\n   The basic principle has been to keep the MIB as simple as\
    \ possible.\n   The Managed objects included in the MIB are divided into three\
    \ tables\n   - dsTable, dsApplIfOpsTable, and dsIntTable.\n      - The dsTable\
    \ contains a list of Directory Servers. The list\n        contains a description\
    \ of the Directory Servers as well as\n        summary statistics on the entries\
    \ held by and the cache\n        performance of each Directory Server. The group\
    \ of servers on\n        this list is likely to contain a part of, if not all,\
    \ the\n        Directory Servers in the management domain.\n      - The dsApplIfOpsTable\
    \ provides summary statistics on the\n        accesses, operations and errors\
    \ for each application protocol\n        interface of a Directory Server.\n  \
    \    - The dsIntTable  provides some useful information on the\n        interaction\
    \ of the monitored Directory Servers with peer\n        Directory Servers.\n \
    \  There are references to the Directory itself for static information\n   pertaining\
    \ to the Directory Server. These references are in the form\n   of \"Directory\
    \ Distinguished Name\" [21] of the corresponding object.\n   It is intended that\
    \ Directory management applications will use these\n   references to obtain further\
    \ information on the objects of interest.\n"

- title: Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "Security Considerations\n   There are no management objects defined in this MIB\
    \ that have a MAX-\n   ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  So, if\
    \ this MIB is\n   implemented correctly, then there is no risk that an intruder\
    \ can\n   alter or create any management objects of this MIB via direct SNMP\n\
    \   SET operations.\n   However, the information itself may partly reveal the\
    \ configuration\n   of the directory system and passively increase its vulnerability.\
    \ The\n   information could also be used to analyze network usage and traffic\n\
    \   patterns.\n   Therefore, it may be important in some environments to control\
    \ read\n   access to these objects and possibly to even encrypt the values of\n\
    \   these object when sending them over the network via SNMP.  Not all\n   versions\
    \ of SNMP provide features for such a secure environment.\n   SNMPv1 by itself\
    \ is such an insecure environment.  Even if the\n   network itself is secure (for\
    \ example by using IPSec), even then,\n   there is no control as to who on the\
    \ secure network is allowed to\n   access and GET (read) the objects in this MIB.\n\
    \   It is recommended that the implementors consider the security\n   features\
    \ as provided by the SNMPv3 framework.  Specifically, the use\n   of the User-based\
    \ Security Model RFC 2574 [12] and the View-based\n   Access Control Model RFC\
    \ 2575 [15] is recommended.\n   It is then a customer/user responsibility to ensure\
    \ that the SNMP\n   entity giving access to an instance of this MIB, is properly\n\
    \   configured to give access to those objects only to those principals\n   (users)\
    \ that have legitimate rights to access them.\n"
