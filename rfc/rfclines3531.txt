Abstract This document proposes a method to manage the assignment of bits of an IPv6 address block or range.
When an organisation needs to make an address plan for its subnets or when an ISP needs to make an address plan for its customers, this method enables the organisation to postpone the final decision on the number of bits to partition in the address space they have.
It does it by keeping the bits around the borders of the partition to be free as long as possible.
This scheme is applicable to any bits addressing scheme using bits with partitions in the space, but its first intended use is for IPv6.
It is a generalization of RFC 1219 and can be used for IPv6 assignments.
Rationale IPv6 addresses have a flexible structure for address assignments.
This enables registries, internet service providers, network designers and others to assign address ranges to organizations and networks based on different criteria, like size of networks, estimated growth rate, etc.
Often, the initial assignment doesn't scale well because a small network becomes larger than expected, needing more addresses.
But then, the assignment authority cannot allocate contiguous addresses because they were already assigned to another network.
RFC 1219 [1] describes an allocation scheme for IPv4 where address space is kept unallocated between the leftmost bits of the subnet part and the rightmost bits of the host part of the address.
This enables the network designer to change the subnet mask without renumbering, for the central bits not allocated.
It can be used for both IPv4 and IPv6.
This document does not provide any recommendation to registries on how to assign address ranges to their customers.
in order, so that an IP address is composed of these parts contiguously.
Boundaries between each part are based on the prefix assigned by the next level authority.
Part p1 is the leftmost part probably assigned to a registry, Part p2 can be allocated to a large internet service provider or to a national registry.
Part p3 can be allocated to a large customer or a smaller provider, etc.
Each part can be of different length.
The algorithm for allocating addresses is as follows: a) for the leftmost part (p1), assign addresses using the leftmost bits first b) for the rightmost part (pN), assign addresses using the rightmost bits first c) for all other parts (center parts), predefine an arbitrary boundary (prefix) and then assign addresses using the center bits first of the part being assigned.
This algorithm grows assigned bits in such way that it keeps unassigned bits near the boundary of the parts.
This means that the prefix between any two parts can be changed forward or backward, later on, up to the assigned bits.
This section describes the assignment of leftmost bits, rightmost bits and centermost bits.
3.1 Leftmost p1 will be assigned in order as follows:
Order   Assignment 1 00000000 2 10000000 3 01000000 4 11000000 5 00100000 6 10100000 7 01100000 8 11100000 9 00010000 ...
This is actually a mirror of binary counting.
(the last part) will be assigned in order as follows:
Order   Assignment 1 00000000 2 00000001 3 00000010 4 00000011 5 00000100 6 00000101 7 00000110 8 00000111 9 00001000 ...
(where 1 < X < N) will be assigned in order as follows: (for example, with a 8 bit predefined length l(pX) 8))
Order   Assignment 1 00000000 2 00001000 3 00010000 4 00011000 5 00000100 6 00001100 7 00010100 8 00011100 9 00100000 ...
The bits are assigned using the following algorithm: 1.
The first round is to select only the middle bit (and if there is an even number of bits  pick the bit following the center) 2.
Create all combinations using the selected bits that haven't yet been created.
Start a new round by adding one more bit to the set.
In even rounds add the preceding bit to the set.
In odd rounds add the subsequent bit to the set.
Repeat 2 and 3 until there are no more bits to consider.
As an example, a provider P1 has been assigned the 3ffe:0b00/24 prefix and wants to assign prefixes to its connected networks.
It anticipates in the foreseeable future a maximum of 256 customers consuming 8 bits.
One of these customers, named C2, anticipates a maximum of 1024 customer's assignments under it, consuming 10 other bits.
The assignment will be as follows, not showing the first 24 leftmost bits (3ffe:0b00/24: 00111111 11111110 00001011):
P1 assigns address space to its customers using leftmost bits:
0000010000 : assigned to C2C1 0000100000 : assigned to C2C2 0000110000 : assigned to C2C3 ...
Customers of C2 can use centermost bits for maximum flexibility and then the last aggregators (should be a network in a site) will be assigned using rightmost bits.
> growing bits By using this method, P1 will be able to expand the number of customers and the customers will be able to modify their first assumptions about the size of their own customers, until the "reserved" bits are assigned.
Security Considerations Address assignment doesn't seem to have any specific security consideration.
