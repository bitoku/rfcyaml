    \ in parent\n   zones to distribute a cryptographic digest of one key in a child's\n\
    \   DNSKEY RRset.  The DS RRset is signed by at least one of the parent\n   zone's\
    \ private zone data signing keys for each algorithm in use by\n   the parent.\
    \  Each signature is published in an RRSIG resource record,\n   owned by the same\

    \ digest type and no other\n   DS RR exists in a zone's DS RRset with a supported\
    \ digest type, then\n   the validator has no supported authentication path leading\
    \ from the\n   parent to the child.  The resolver should treat this case as it\
    \ would\n   the case of an authenticated NSEC RRset proving that no DS RRset\n\
    \   exists, as described in [RFC4035], Section 5.2.\n   Because zone administrators\
    \ cannot control the deployment speed of\n   support for SHA-256 in validators\
    \ that may be referencing any of\n   their zones, zone operators should consider\
    \ deploying both SHA-1 and\n   SHA-256 based DS records.  This should be done\
    \ for every DNSKEY for\n   which DS records are being generated.  Whether to make\
    \ use of both\n   digest types and for how long is a policy decision that extends\n\

- title: 6.1.  Potential Digest Type Downgrade Attacks
  contents:
  - "6.1.  Potential Digest Type Downgrade Attacks\n   A downgrade attack from a stronger\
    \ digest type to a weaker one is\n   possible if all of the following are true:\n\
    \   o  A zone includes multiple DS records for a given child's DNSKEY,\n     \
    \ each of which uses a different digest type.\n   o  A validator accepts a weaker\
    \ digest even if a stronger one is\n      present but invalid.\n   For example,\
    \ if the following conditions are all true:\n   o  Both SHA-1 and SHA-256 based\
    \ digests are published in DS records\n      within a parent zone for a given\
    \ child zone's DNSKEY.\n   o  The DS record with the SHA-1 digest matches the\
    \ digest computed\n      using the child zone's DNSKEY.\n   o  The DS record with\
    \ the SHA-256 digest fails to match the digest\n      computed using the child\
    \ zone's DNSKEY.\n   Then, if the validator accepts the above situation as secure,\
    \ then\n   this can be used as a downgrade attack since the stronger SHA-256\n\
    \   digest is ignored.\n"
- title: 6.2.  SHA-1 vs. SHA-256 Considerations for DS Records
  contents:
  - "6.2.  SHA-1 vs. SHA-256 Considerations for DS Records\n   Users of DNSSEC are\
    \ encouraged to deploy SHA-256 as soon as software\n   implementations allow for\
    \ it.  SHA-256 is widely believed to be more\n   resilient to attack than SHA-1,\
    \ and confidence in SHA-1's strength is\n   being eroded by recently announced\
    \ attacks.  Regardless of whether\n   the attacks on SHA-1 will affect DNSSEC,\
    \ it is believed (at the time\n   of this writing) that SHA-256 is the better\
    \ choice for use in DS\n   records.\n   At the time of this publication, the SHA-256\
    \ digest algorithm is\n   considered sufficiently strong for the immediate future.\
    \  It is also\n   considered sufficient for use in DNSSEC DS RRs for the immediate\n\
    \   future.  However, future published attacks may weaken the usability\n   of\
    \ this algorithm within the DS RRs.  It is beyond the scope of this\n   document\
    \ to speculate extensively on the cryptographic strength of\n   the SHA-256 digest\
    \ algorithm.\n   Likewise, it is also beyond the scope of this document to specify\n\
    \   whether or for how long SHA-1 based DS records should be\n   simultaneously\
    \ published alongside SHA-256 based DS records.\n"
