  contents:
  - "1. Introduction\n   This memo specifies the frame format for transmission of\
    \ IPv6 [IPV6]\n   packets and the method of forming IPv6 link-local addresses\
    \ over IPv4\n   multicast \"domains\".  For the purposes of this document, an\
    \ IPv4\n   domain is a fully interconnected set of IPv4 subnets, within the same\n\
    \   local multicast scope, on which there are at least two IPv6 nodes\n   conforming\
    \ to this specification.  This IPv4 domain could form part\n   of the globally-unique\
    \ IPv4 address space, or could form part of a\n   private IPv4 network [RFC 1918].\n\
    \   This memo also specifies the content of the Source/Target Link-layer\n   Address\
    \ option used in the Router Solicitation, Router Advertisement,\n   Neighbor Solicitation,\
    \ Neighbor Advertisement and Redirect messages\n   described in [DISC], when those\
    \ messages are transmitted on an IPv4\n   multicast domain.\n   The motivation\
    \ for this method is to allow isolated IPv6 hosts,\n   located on a physical link\
    \ which has no directly connected IPv6\n   router, to become fully functional\
    \ IPv6 hosts by using an IPv4\n   multicast domain as their virtual local link.\
    \  Thus, at least one\n   IPv6 router using the same method must be connected\
    \ to the same IPv4\n   domain if IPv6 routing to other links is required.\n  \
    \ IPv6 hosts connected using this method do not require IPv4-compatible\n   addresses\
    \ or configured tunnels.  In this way IPv6 gains considerable\n   independence\
    \ of the underlying links and can step over many hops of\n   IPv4 subnets. The\
    \ mechanism is known formally as \"IPv6 over IPv4\" or\n   \"6over4\" and colloquially\
    \ as \"virtual Ethernet\".\n   The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\"\
    , \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \
    \ \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n   document are to be interpreted as described\
    \ in [RFC2119].\n"
- title: 2. Maximum Transmission Unit
  contents:
  - "2. Maximum Transmission Unit\n   The default MTU size for IPv6 packets on an\
    \ IPv4 domain is 1480\n   octets.  This size may be varied by a Router Advertisement\
    \ [DISC]\n   containing an MTU option which specifies a different MTU, or by\n\
    \   manual configuration of each node.\n   Note that if by chance the IPv6 MTU\
    \ size proves to be too large for\n   some intermediate IPv4 subnet, IPv4 fragmentation\
    \ will ensue.  While\n   undesirable, this is not disastrous. However, the IPv4\

- title: 7. Scaling and Transition Issues
  contents:
  - "7. Scaling and Transition Issues\n   The multicast mechanism described in Section\
    \ 6 above appears to have\n   essentially the same scaling properties as native\
    \ IPv6 over most\n   media, except for the slight reduction in MTU size which\
    \ will\n   slightly reduce bulk throughput.  On an ATM network, where IPv4\n \
    \  multicast relies on relatively complex mechanisms, it is to be\n   expected\
    \ that IPv6 over IPv4 over ATM will perform less well than\n   native IPv6 over\
    \ ATM.\n   The \"IPv6 over IPv4\" mechanism is intended to take its place in the\n\
    \   range of options available for transition from IPv4 to IPv6.  In\n   particular\
    \ it allows a site to run both IPv4 and IPv6 in coexistence,\n   without having\
    \ to configure IPv6 hosts either with IPv4-compatible\n   addresses or with tunnels.\
    \  Interfaces of the IPv6 router and hosts\n   will of course need to be enabled\
    \ in \"6over4\" mode.\n   A site may choose to start its IPv6 transition by configuring\
    \ one\n   IPv6 router to support \"6over4\" on an interface connected to the\n\
    \   site's IPv4 domain, and another IPv6 format on an interface connected\n  \
    \ to the IPv6 Internet.  Any enabled \"6over4\" hosts in the IPv4 domain\n   will\
    \ then be able to communicate both with the router and with the\n   IPv6 Internet,\
    \ without manual configuration of a tunnel and without\n   the need for an IPv4-compatible\
    \ IPv6 address, either stateless or\n   stateful address configuration providing\
    \ the IPv6 address to the IPv6\n   host.\n   During transition, routers may need\
    \ to advertise at least two IPv6\n   prefixes, one for the native LAN (e.g. Ethernet)\
    \ and one for\n   \"6over4\".  As with any IPv6 prefix assigned to an IPv6 subnet,\
    \ the\n   latter MUST be unique within its scope, whether site-local or global\n\
    \   addressing is used.\n   Also note that when a router is handling both native\
    \ LAN and \"6over4\"\n   on the same physical interface,  during stateless autoconfiguration,\n\
    \   there is a period when IPv6 link-local addresses are used, in both\n   cases\
    \ with the prefix FE80::/64. Note that the prefix-length for\n   these link-local\
    \ adddress MUST then be 128 so that the two cases can\n   be distinguished.\n\
    \   As the site installs additional IPv6 routers, \"6over4\" hosts which\n   become\
    \ physically adjacent to IPv6 routers can be changed to run as\n   native IPv6\
    \ hosts, with the the only impact on IPv6 applications\n   being a slight increase\
    \ in MTU size. At some stage during transition,\n   it might be convenient to\
    \ dual home hosts in both native LAN and\n   \"6over4\" mode, but this is not\
    \ required.\n"

  - "8. IANA Considerations\n   No assignments by the IANA are required beyond those\

- title: 9. Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "9. Security Considerations\n   Implementors should be aware that, in addition\
    \ to posssible attacks\n   against IPv6, security attacks against IPv4 must also\
    \ be considered.\n   Use of IP security at both IPv4 and IPv6 levels should nevertheless\n\
    \   be avoided, for efficiency reasons.  For example, if IPv6 is running\n   encrypted,\
    \ encryption of IPv4 would be redundant except if traffic\n   analysis is felt\
    \ to be a threat.  If IPv6 is running authenticated,\n   then authentication of\
    \ IPv4 will add little.  Conversely, IPv4\n   security will not protect IPv6 traffic\
    \ once it leaves the IPv6-over-\n   IPv4 domain.  Therefore, implementing IPv6\
    \ security is required even\n   if IPv4 security is available.\n   There is a\
    \ possible spoofing attack in which spurious 6over4 packets\n   are injected into\
    \ a 6over4 domain from outside. Thus, boundary\n   routers MUST discard multicast\
    \ IPv4 packets with source or\n   destination multicast addresses of organisation\
    \ local scope as\n   defined in section 6 above, if they arrive on physical interfaces\n\
    \   outside that scope. To defend against spurious unicast 6over4\n   packets,\
    \ boundary routers MUST discard incoming IPv4 packets with\n   protocol type 41\
    \ from unknown sources, i.e.  IPv6-in-IPv4 tunnels\n   must only be accepted from\
    \ trusted sources.  Unless IPSEC\n   authentication is available, the RECOMMENDED\
    \ technique for this is to\n   configure the boundary router only to accept protocol\
    \ type 41 packets\n   from source addresses within a trusted range or ranges.\n"
