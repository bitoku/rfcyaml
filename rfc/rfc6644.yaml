  - "1.  Introduction\n   DHCPv6 [RFC3315] allows a server to send an unsolicited\
    \ Reconfigure\n   message to a client.  The client's response to a Reconfigure\
    \ message,\n   according to Section 19 of RFC 3315, is either a Renew or an\n\
    \   Information-request message, depending on the contents of the\n   msg-type\
    \ field in the Reconfigure Message option of the Reconfigure\n   message.  If\
    \ the client sends a Renew message, it includes a Server\n   Identifier option\
    \ in the Renew message to specify the server that\n   should respond to the Renew\
    \ message.  The specification defined in\n   RFC 3315 is suitable only for scenarios\
    \ in which the client would\n   communicate with the same DHCPv6 servers.\n  \
    \ There are also scenarios where the client must communicate with a\n   different\
    \ server; for example, a network administrator may choose to\n   shut down a DHCPv6\
    \ server and move the clients who most recently\n   communicated with it to a\
    \ different server.  Hence, this document\n   expands the allowed values of the\
    \ message type field within the\n   reconfiguration message to allow the server\
    \ to indicate to the client\n   to send a Rebind message, which does not include\
    \ a Server Identifier\n   option, and allows any server to respond to the client.\n\
    \   RFC 3315 does not specify that a Reconfigure message must be sent\n   from\
    \ the server with which the client most recently communicated, and\n   it does\
    \ not specify which server the client should identify with a\n   Server Identifier\
    \ option when the client responds to the Reconfigure\n   message.  This document\
    \ clarifies that the client should send a Renew\n   message in response to a Reconfigure\
    \ message with a Server Identifier\n   option identifying the same server that\
    \ the client would have\n   identified if the client had sent the Renew message\
    \ after expiration\n   of the timer T1.\n"

  - "7.  Security Considerations\n   This document allows the Rebind message type\
    \ to appear in the\n   Reconfigure Message option of a Reconfigure message so\
    \ that the\n   client rebinds to a different DHCPv6 server.  A malicious attacker\n\
    \   may use a faked Reconfigure message to force the client to disconnect\n  \
    \ from the current server and relink to a faked server by quickly\n   responding\
    \ to the client's Rebind message.  A similar attack is\n   available in DHCPv6\
    \ by an attacker spoofing itself as a valid DHCPv6\n   server in response to a\
    \ Solicit or Request message.  These attacks\n   can be prevented by using the\
    \ AUTH option [RFC3315].  DHCPv6 clients\n   that support Reconfigure-Rebind MUST\
    \ implement the Reconfigure Key\n   authentication protocol as described in [RFC3315],\
    \ Section 21.5.\n   Other authentication mechanisms may optionally be implemented.\
    \  For\n   example, the Secure DHCPv6 [SEC-DHCPv6], based on Cryptographically\n\
    \   Generated Addresses (CGA) [RFC3972], can provide source address (for\n   the\
