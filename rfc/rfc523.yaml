  - "                      SURVEY is in Operation Again\nThe purpose of this message\
    \ is to inform the network community that the\nsurvey program at MIT-DMCG computer\
    \ system is in operation now.  We are\nsurveying hosts every 20 minutes instead\
    \ of the earlier 15 minutes.  It\nappears that some sites had problems with incomplete\
    \ ICP's when survey\nfirst came up.  The problem has definitely been fixed now.\
    \  Please let\nme know (tel 617-253-1428 or 253-1449) if any site is being\ninconvenienced\
    \ by the survey program.  Upon written request I will be\nwilling to not survey\
    \ a particular server site.  Upon oral or written\nrequest, I will add sites who\
    \ wish to be surveyed but are not surveyed.\nThe sites currently being surveyed\
    \ are (host number in decimal):\n1,2,3,4,6,7,8,9,10,11,13,14,15,16,23,31,32,35,65,66,69,70,74,78,86,133,\n\
    134,138,198.  We issue an RFC to socket1 and now go though the complete\nICP,\
    \ ie establish telnet connections and then close them.  The time for\nresponse\
    \ is now the time to establish the telnet connections, so if your\nresponse time\
    \ shows a larger number don't be alarmed (I think the new\nnumbers are more meaningful\
    \ and reflect the situation more accurately.)\nWe are also providing a NETSTATUS\
    \ service on socket 15. (decimal).  So\nif you ICP to host 70 socket 15., you\
    \ will get the following output:\n        mm,dd.yyyy,hh,mm\n        nnn,c,ttt\n\
    \        nnn,c,ttt\n        -1\nWhere first item is month, day, year, hour, minute\
    \ and then is a list of\nhost numbers, code, response time in tenths of second.\
    \  The list ends\nwith a minus 1, and we close the connections right after sending\
    \ data\n(The service is designed so that both human users and programs can use\n\
    the data ).  You can of course log into dmcg and use our NETWRK\nsubsystem which\
    \ has commands for displaying the survey data in many\nformats (Ref. RFC 308,\
    \ NIC 9259).  We are also recording this data on\nthe DATACOMPUTER (CCA).  Your\
    \ comments and suggestions will be\nappreciated.\n                        Thank\
    \ You\n       [ This RFC was put into machine readable form for entry ]\n    \
