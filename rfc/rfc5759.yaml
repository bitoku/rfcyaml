  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   This document specifies a base profile for X.509 v3 Certificates\
    \ and\n   X.509 v2 Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs) for use by applications\n\
    \   that support the United States National Security Agency's Suite B\n   Cryptography.\n\
    \   The reader is assumed to have familiarity with [RFC5280].  This Suite\n  \
    \ B Certificate and CRL Profile is a profile of RFC 5280.  All MUST-\n   level\
    \ requirements of RFC 5280 apply throughout this profile and are\n   generally\
    \ not repeated here.  In cases where a MUST-level requirement\n   is repeated\
    \ for emphasis, the text notes the requirement is \"in\n   adherence with [RFC5280]\"\
    .  This profile contains changes that\n   elevate some MAY-level options in RFC\
    \ 5280 to SHOULD-level and MUST-\n   level in this profile; this profile also\
    \ contains changes that\n   elevate some SHOULD-level options in RFC 5280 to MUST-level\
    \ for this\n   profile.  All options from RFC 5280 that are not listed in this\n\
    \   profile remain at the requirement level of RFC 5280.\n   The reader is also\
    \ assumed to have familiarity with [RFC5480], which\n   specifies the syntax and\
    \ semantics for the Subject Public Key\n   Information field in certificates that\
    \ support Elliptic Curve\n   Cryptography and [RFC5758], which specifies algorithm\
    \ identifiers for\n   Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA).\n"

- title: 3.  Requirements and Assumptions
  contents:
  - "3.  Requirements and Assumptions\n   The goal of this document is to define a\
    \ base set of certificate and\n   CRL formats to support interoperability among\
    \ Suite B solutions.\n   Specific communities, such as the US National Security\
    \ Systems, may\n   define community profiles that further restrict certificate\
    \ and CRL\n   formats by mandating the presence of extensions that are optional\
    \ in\n   this base profile, defining new optional or critical extension types,\n\
    \   or restricting the values and/or presence of fields within existing\n   extensions.\
    \  However, communications between distinct communities\n   MUST use the formats\
    \ specified in this document when interoperability\n   is desired.  (Applications\
    \ may add additional non-critical extensions\n   to these formats but they MUST\
    \ NOT assume that a remote peer will be\n   able to process them.)\n"
- title: 3.1.  Implementing Suite B
  contents:
  - "3.1.  Implementing Suite B\n   Every Suite B certificate MUST use the X.509 v3\
    \ format, and contain\n   either:\n      * An ECDSA-capable signing key, using\
    \ curve P-256 or P-384; or\n      * An ECDH-capable (Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman)\
    \ key\n        establishment key, using curve P-256 or P-384.\n   Every Suite\
    \ B certificate and CRL MUST be signed using ECDSA.  The\n   signing Certification\
    \ Authority's  (CA's) key MUST be on the curve\n   P-256 or P-384 if the certificate\
    \ contains a key on the curve P-256.\n   If the certificate contains a key on\
    \ the curve P-384, the signing\n   CA's key MUST be on the curve P-384.  Any certificate\
    \ and CRL MUST be\n   hashed using SHA-256 or SHA-384, matched to the size of\
    \ the signing\n   CA's key.\n"
- title: 3.2.  Suite B Object Identifiers
  contents:
  - "3.2.  Suite B Object Identifiers\n   The primary OID structure for Suite B is\
    \ as follows per [X9.62],\n   [SEC2], [RFC5480], and [RFC5758].\n      ansi-X9-62\

- title: 4.  Suite B Certificate and Certificate Extensions Profile
  contents:
  - "4.  Suite B Certificate and Certificate Extensions Profile\n   This Suite B certificate\
    \ profile is a profile of [RFC5280].  The\n   changes in the requirements from\
    \ RFC 5280 are listed here.  Note that\n   RFC 5280 has varying mandates for marking\
    \ extensions as critical or\n   non-critical.  This profile changes some of those\
    \ mandates for\n   extensions that are included in Suite B certificates.\n"
- title: 4.1.  signatureAlgorithm
  contents:
  - "4.1.  signatureAlgorithm\n   The two algorithm identifiers used by Suite B are:\n\

    \ ecdsa-with-SHA384, as described in [RFC5758] AND [X9.62].\n   The parameters\
    \ MUST be absent as per [RFC5758].\n"
- title: 4.2.  signatureValue
  contents:
  - "4.2.  signatureValue\n   ECDSA digital signature generation is described in [FIPS186-3].\
    \  An\n   ECDSA signature value is comprised of two unsigned integers, denoted\n\
    \   as r and s.  r and s MUST be represented as ASN.1 INTEGERs.  If the\n   high\
    \ order bit of the unsigned integer is a 1, an octet with the\n   value 0x00 MUST\
    \ be prepended to the binary representation before\n   encoding it as an ASN.1\
    \ INTEGER.  Unsigned integers for the P-256 and\n   P-384 curves can be a maximum\
    \ of 32 and 48 bytes, respectively.\n   Therefore, converting each r and s to\
    \ an ASN.1 INTEGER will result in\n   a maximum of 33 bytes for the P-256 curve\
    \ and 49 bytes for the P-384\n   curve.\n   The ECDSA signatureValue in an X.509\
    \ certificate is encoded as a BIT\n   STRING value of a DER-encoded SEQUENCE of\
    \ the two INTEGERS.  As per\n   [RFC5480], the structure, included for convenience,\
    \ is as follows:\n      ECDSA-Sig-Value ::= SEQUENCE {\n          r  INTEGER,\n\
    \          s  INTEGER\n        }\n   For example, in a signature using P-256 and\
