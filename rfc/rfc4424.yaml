  - "1.  Introduction\n   This document is an addendum to RFC 4348 [2] and contains\
    \ the\n   necessary updates for the support of the new operating mode of 3GPP2\n\
    \   VMR-WB standard [1].  The new mode of VMR-WB standard (VMR-WB mode\n   4),\
    \ although operating at a lower data rate, has similar\n   characteristics and\
    \ functionalities compared to the existing modes of\n   VMR-WB already included\
    \ in RFC 4348 (e.g., variable bit rate,\n   narrowband/wideband input/output speech/audio\
    \ processing capability,\n   continuous and discontinuous transmission, etc.).\
    \  Therefore, all\n   provisions and restrictions specified in RFC 4348 are applicable\
    \ to\n   all modes of the VMR-WB standard including the new mode, which is\n \
    \  specified in this document.  As a result, no new media type\n   registration\
    \ is required.\n   The VMR-WB file format for transport of VMR-WB speech data\
    \ in storage\n   mode applications is specified in [1,4] and includes support\
    \ for the\n   new mode of operation.\n   The following sections provide the necessary\
    \ updates to RFC 4348 to\n   enable support of VMR-WB mode 4.\n"

- title: 3.  The Variable-Rate Multimode Wideband (VMR-WB) Extension
  contents:
  - "3.  The Variable-Rate Multimode Wideband (VMR-WB) Extension\n   VMR-WB is the\
    \ wideband speech-coding standard developed by the Third\n   Generation Partnership\
    \ Project 2 (3GPP2) for encoding/decoding\n   wideband/narrowband speech content\
    \ in multimedia services in 3G CDMA\n   cellular systems [1].  VMR-WB is a source-controlled\
    \ variable-rate\n   multimode wideband speech codec.  It has a number of operating\
    \ modes,\n   where each mode is a trade-off between voice quality and average\
    \ data\n   rate.  The operating mode in VMR-WB (as shown in Table 2) is chosen\n\
    \   based on the traffic condition of the network and the desired quality\n  \
    \ of service.  The desired average data rate (ADR) in each mode is\n   obtained\
    \ by encoding speech frames at permissible rates (as shown in\n   Tables 1 and\
    \ 3) compliant with CDMA2000 system depending on the\n   instantaneous characteristics\
    \ of input speech and the maximum and\n   minimum rate constraints imposed by\
    \ the network operator.\n   The capabilities of the VMR-WB codec were extended\
    \ through the\n   addition of a new mode operating at lower average data rates,\n\
    \   resulting in improved system capacity in IP and non-IP networks [1].\n   As\
    \ a result of this extension, certain reserved table entries in RFC\n   4348 are\
    \ used to include support for the new operating mode.  VMR-WB\n   mode 4 is compliant\
    \ with all applicable provisions and restrictions\n   specified in RFC 4348 [2].\
    \  Note that the existing table entries of\n   RFC 4348 remain unchanged (e.g.,\
    \ frame types) and the original modes\n   of VMR-WB are not affected by these\
    \ updates.\n   The existing flexibility in RFC 4348 for future extensions allows\
    \ the\n   addition of the new mode without any impact on the interoperability\n\
    \   with earlier implementations of RFC 4348.\n   The following sections provide\
    \ the necessary updates that are\n   required to be made in RFC 4348.\n   The\
    \ provisions and considerations for implementation, congestion\n   control, and\
    \ security remain identical to those specified in RFC\n   4348.\n"
