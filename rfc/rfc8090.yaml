- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   The \"IANA IPR Community Agreement\" [1] was one of the\
    \ many documents\n   that was part of the IANA Stewardship Transition.  It calls\
    \ for the\n   creation of the Community Coordination Group (CCG) to provide\n\
    \   guidance and advice to the IETF Trust regarding the stewardship of\n   the\
    \ IANA Intellectual Property, which is the IANA trademarks and the\n   IANA domain\
    \ names.\n   The CCG is comprised of nine individuals, called the CCG\n   Representatives.\
    \  The three operational communities (i.e., the Names\n   Community, the Numbers\
    \ Community, and the Protocol Parameters\n   Community) each appoint three CCG\
    \ Representatives.  Each operational\n   community has the right to change any\
    \ of its CCG Representatives upon\n   written notice to the other operational\
    \ communities and the IETF\n   Trust.  An operational community may remove or\
    \ replace its CCG\n   Representatives at any time and at its sole discretion.\
    \  The means\n   and procedures by which an operational community chooses to select,\n\
    \   appoint, and remove its own CCG Representatives are determined solely\n  \
    \ by that operational community.\n   Each operational community appoints one of\
    \ its CCG Representatives as\n   a co-chair of the CCG, and that co-chair is empowered\
    \ to speak on\n   behalf of its operational community regarding the IANA Intellectual\n\
    \   Property.  An operational community has the right to change its CCG\n   co-chair\
    \ upon written notice to the other operational communities and\n   the IETF Trust.\
    \  An operational community may remove or replace its\n   CCG co-chair at any\
    \ time and at its sole discretion.\n   This document outlines the procedures for\
    \ the IETF to select,\n   appoint, and remove the three CCG Representatives for\
    \ the Protocol\n   Parameter Community.  In addition, this document outlines the\n\
    \   procedures for the selection of the co-chair among those CCG\n   Representatives.\n"
- title: 2.  Desirable Qualifications for CCG Representatives
  contents:
  - "2.  Desirable Qualifications for CCG Representatives\n   Candidates for the CCG\
    \ Representative position for the Protocol\n   Parameters Community should have\
    \ a demonstrable involvement in the\n   IETF and a solid understanding of the\
    \ various ways that the IETF\n   makes use of protocol parameter registries. \
    \ Candidates should be\n   familiar with the ways that the IETF community depends\
    \ upon the IANA\n   trademarks and the IANA domain names.\n   Candidates are expected\
    \ to be able to call on others in the IETF\n   community, as required, to ensure\
    \ that the IETF Trust receives the\n   highest quality advice available.\n   Candidates\
    \ are expected to possess clearly demonstrated technical\n   competence relating\
    \ to the management of IANA protocol parameter\n   registries.  Candidates are\
    \ also expected to be able to understand\n   the ways that IANA registries are\
    \ used by the Names Community and the\n   Numbers Community.\n"
- title: 3.  CCG Representative Selection Procedures
  contents:
  - "3.  CCG Representative Selection Procedures\n   The three CCG Representatives\
    \ for the Protocol Parameters Community\n   serve at the pleasure of the IAB.\n"
- title: 3.1.  Duration of Appointment
  contents:
  - "3.1.  Duration of Appointment\n   Each of the CCG Representatives is expected\
    \ to serve for at least a\n   year, and appointments ought to be staggered to\
    \ avoid simultaneous\n   replacement of all of the CCG Representatives at the\
    \ same time.  Each\n   year the IAB will seek input from the IETF community to\
    \ determine\n   whether a personnel change is appropriate.\n"
- title: 3.2.  Nominations and Eligibility
  contents:
  - "3.2.  Nominations and Eligibility\n   When the IAB decides to appoint a new person\
    \ as a CCG Representative,\n   the IAB will make a public call for nominations\
    \ on the\n   ietf-announce@ietf.org mailing list.  The public call will specify\n\
    \   the manner by which nominations will be accepted and the means by\n   which\
    \ the list of nominees will be published for IETF community\n   feedback.  Self-nominations\
    \ are permitted.\n   Each nomination must include the name and contact information\
    \ for\n   each candidate.  The details about the candidate's background and\n\
    \   qualifications for the position should be provided with the\n   nomination.\
    \  Trustees of the IETF Trust are not eligible for\n   nomination.  All other\
    \ IETF participants, including working group\n   chairs, IETF NomCom members,\
    \ IAB members, and IESG members are\n   eligible for nomination.\n   IAB members\
    \ who accept a nomination shall recuse themselves from\n   selection discussions.\n"
- title: 3.3.  Selection
  contents:
  - "3.3.  Selection\n   The IAB will publish the list of people that have accepted\
    \ their\n   nomination or have nominated themselves.  Feedback from the IETF\n\
    \   community will be considered by the IAB in making a selection.  The\n   IAB\
    \ will keep any received feedback confidential.\n   The IAB will consider potential\
    \ conflicts with a CCG Representative\n   position and any other positions held\
    \ by the nominated candidates.\n   After considering the IETF community feedback,\
    \ potential conflicts,\n   and any other appropriate information that is available,\
    \ the IAB\n   shall vote to select the best qualified CCG Representative.\n"
- title: 4.  CCG Representative Removal Procedures
  contents:
  - "4.  CCG Representative Removal Procedures\n   If there are concerns with the\
    \ performance of an IAB-appointed CCG\n   Representative, the IETF community can\
    \ request that the IAB consider\n   removal.  Such a request must be sent by email\
    \ to iab-chair@iab.org.\n   The request must include a statement of justification\
    \ for the removal\n   of the CCG Representative, including all relevant and appropriate\n\
    \   supporting documentation.\n   The IAB shall respond to the request within\
    \ six weeks.  If an IAB\n   member is serving in any of the CCG Representative\
    \ positions,\n   regardless of the operational community that the IAB member\n\
    \   represents, that IAB member shall be recused from any investigation,\n   discussion,\
    \ and vote to determine what action to take.\n   If the CCG Representative is\
    \ removed, then the open position is to be\n   filled according to Section 3 of\
    \ this document.\n"
- title: 5.  CCG Representative Co-Chair Selection Procedures
  contents:
  - "5.  CCG Representative Co-Chair Selection Procedures\n   Whenever there is a\
    \ change to the list of people that are serving as\n   CCG Representatives for\
    \ the Protocol Parameters Community, the\n   sitting CCG Representatives shall\
    \ use a procedure of their own\n   choosing to select the co-chair.  The co-chair\
    \ selection shall be\n   confirmed by the IAB, and then the IAB shall announce\
    \ the co-chair\n   selection to the IETF community, the IETF Trust, and the CCG\n\
    \   Representatives from the other operational communities.\n   At any time, for\
    \ any reason, the list of people that are serving as\n   CCG Representatives for\
    \ the Protocol Parameters Community may revisit\n   the selection of co-chair.\
    \  If a different selection is made, the new\n   selection shall be confirmed\
    \ by the IAB, and then the IAB shall\n   announce the co-chair selection to the\
    \ IETF community, the IETF\n   Trust, and the CCG Representatives from the other\
    \ operational\n   communities.\n   As part of the confirmation process, the IAB\
    \ shall consider potential\n   conflicts of interest of the candidate for co-chair.\n"
- title: 6.  Initial Appointments
  contents:
  - "6.  Initial Appointments\n   Since three CCG Representatives needed to be in\
    \ place at midnight on\n   30 September 2016 when the IANA Stewardship Transition\
    \ took place,\n   the IAB quickly appointed three individuals that were heavily\n\
    \   involved in the transition.  The three individuals agreed to serve\n   until\
    \ the appointment procedures could be adopted and employed.\n   Using the procedures\
    \ in this document, the IAB will appoint three CCG\n   Representatives before\
    \ the second IETF meeting in 2017.\n   To encourage the staggered replacement,\
    \ at least one of those\n   appointed will be replaced before the second IETF\
    \ meeting in 2018,\n   that is, one year after the first set of CCG Representatives\
    \ are\n   appointed by the process in this document.\n"
- title: 7.  Reporting by the CCG Representatives to the IAB
  contents:
  - "7.  Reporting by the CCG Representatives to the IAB\n   CCG Representatives shall\
    \ deliver reports to the IAB within a\n   reasonable time frame, providing whenever\
    \ possible the opportunity to\n   obtain advice regarding open IANA Intellectual\
    \ Property issues.\n   While no specific time periods for reporting are mandated,\
    \ CCG\n   Representatives are expected to keep the IAB informed of CCG\n   activities.\n\
    \   Reports from the CCG Representatives will be made publicly available,\n  \
    \ except for comments about individuals.  These reports will typically\n   be\
    \ part of the minutes of the IAB meeting where they are discussed.\n"
