  - "Abstract\n   This document provides recommendations to the addressing registries\n\
    \   (APNIC, ARIN and RIPE-NCC) on policies for assigning IPv6 address\n   blocks\
    \ to end sites.  In particular, it recommends the assignment of\n   /48 in the\
    \ general case, /64 when it is known that one and only one\n   subnet is needed\
    \ and /128 when it is absolutely known that one and\n   only one device is connecting.\n\
    \   The original recommendations were made in an IAB/IESG statement\n   mailed\
    \ to the registries on September 1, 2000.  This document refines\n   the original\
    \ recommendation and documents it for the historical\n   record.\n"
- title: 1. Introduction
  contents:
  - "1. Introduction\n   There have been many discussions between IETF and RIR experts\
    \ on the\n   topic of IPv6 address allocation policy.  This memo addresses the\n\
    \   issue of the boundary in between the public and the private topology\n   in\
    \ the Internet, that is, how much address space should an ISP\n   allocate to\
    \ homes, small and large enterprises, mobile networks and\n   transient customers.\n\
    \   This document does not address the issue of the other boundaries in\n   the\
    \ public topology, that is, between the RIRs and the LIRs.\n   This document was\
    \ developed by the IPv6 Directorate, IAB and IESG,\n   and is a recommendation\
    \ from the IAB and IESG to the RIRs.\n"
- title: 2. Background
  contents:
  - "2. Background\n   The technical principles that apply to address allocation seek\
    \ to\n   balance healthy conservation practices and wisdom with a certain ease\n\
    \   of access.  On one hand, when managing a potentially limited\n   resource,\
    \ one must conserve wisely to prevent exhaustion within an\n   expected lifetime.\
    \  On the other hand, the IPv6 address space is in\n   no sense as limited a resource\
    \ as the IPv4 address space, and\n   unwarranted conservatism acts as a disincentive\
    \ in a marketplace\n   already dampened by other factors.  So from a market development\n\
    \   perspective, we would like to see it be very easy for a user or an\n   ISP\
    \ to obtain as many IPv6 addresses as they really need without a\n   prospect\
    \ of immediate renumbering or of scaling inefficiencies.\n   The IETF makes no\
    \ comment on business issues or relationships.\n   However, in general, we observe\
    \ that technical delegation policy can\n   have strong business impacts.  A strong\
    \ requirement of the address\n   delegation plan is that it not be predicated\
    \ on or unduly bias\n   business relationships or models.\n   The IPv6 address,\
    \ as currently defined, consists of 64 bits of\n   \"network number\" and 64 bits\
    \ of \"host number\".  The technical reasons\n   for this are several.  The requirements\
    \ for IPv6 agreed to in 1993\n   included a plan to be able to address approximately\
    \ 2^40 networks and\n   2^50 hosts; the 64/64 split effectively accomplishes this.\n\
    \   Procedures used in host address assignment, such as the router\n   advertisement\
    \ of a network's prefix to hosts [RFC2462], which in turn\n   place a locally\
    \ unique number in the host portion, depend on this\n   split.  Subnet numbers\
    \ must be assumed to come from the network part.\n   This is not to preclude routing\
    \ protocols such as IS-IS level 1\n   (intra-area) routing, which routes individual\
    \ host addresses, but\n   says that it may not be depended upon in the world outside\
    \ that zone.\n   The 64-bit host field can also be used with EUI-64 for a flat,\n\
    \   uniquely allocated space, and therefore it may not be globally\n   treated\
    \ as a subnetting resource.  Those concerned with privacy\n   issues linked to\
    \ the presence of a globally unique identifier may\n   note that 64 bits makes\
    \ a large enough field to maintain excellent\n   random-number-draw properties\
    \ for self-configured End System\n   Designators.  That alternative construction\
    \ of this 64-bit host part\n   of an IPv6 address is documented in [RFC3041].\n\
    \   While the IETF has also gone to a great deal of effort to minimize\n   the\
    \ impacts of network renumbering, renumbering of IPv6 networks is\n   neither\
    \ invisible nor completely painless.  Therefore, renumbering\n   should be considered\
    \ a tolerable event, but to be avoided if\n   reasonably feasible.\n   In [RFC2374]\
    \ and [RFC2450], the IETF's IPNG working group has\n   recommended that the address\
    \ block given to a single edge network\n   which may be recursively subnetted\
    \ be a 48-bit prefix.  This gives\n   each such network 2^16 subnet numbers to\
    \ use in routing, and a very\n   large number of unique host numbers within each\
    \ network.  This is\n   deemed to be large enough for most enterprises, and to\
    \ leave plenty\n   of room for delegation of address blocks to aggregating entities.\n\
    \   It is not obvious, however, that all edge networks are likely to be\n   recursively\
    \ subnetted; a single PC in a home or a telephone in a\n   mobile cellular network,\
    \ for example, may or may not interface to a\n   subnetted local network.  When\
    \ a network number is delegated to a\n   place that will not require subnetting,\
    \ therefore, it might be\n   acceptable for an ISP to give a single 64-bit prefix\
    \ - perhaps shared\n   among the dial-in connections to the same ISP router. \
    \ However this\n   decision may be taken in the knowledge that there is objectively\
    \ no\n   shortage of /48s, and the expectation that personal, home networks\n\
    \   will become the norm.  Indeed, it is widely expected that all IPv6\n   subscribers,\
    \ whether domestic (homes), mobile (vehicles or\n   individuals), or enterprises\
    \ of any size, will eventually possess\n   multiple always-on hosts, at least\
    \ one subnet with the potential for\n   additional subnetting, and therefore some\
    \ internal routing\n   capability.  In other words the subscriber allocation unit\
    \ is not\n   always a host; it is always potentially a site.  The question this\n\
    \   memo is addressing is how much address space should be delegated to\n   such\
    \ sites.\n"
- title: 3. Address Delegation Recommendations
  contents:
  - "3. Address Delegation Recommendations\n   The IESG and the IAB recommend the\
    \ allocations for the boundary\n   between the public and the private topology\
    \ to follow those general\n   rules:\n      -  /48 in the general case, except\
    \ for very large subscribers.\n      -  /64 when it is known that one and only\
    \ one subnet is needed by\n         design.\n      -  /128 when it is absolutely\
    \ known that one and only one device\n         is connecting.\n   In particular,\
    \ we recommend:\n      -  Home network subscribers, connecting through on-demand\
    \ or\n         always-on connections should receive a /48.\n      -  Small and\
    \ large enterprises should receive a /48.\n      -  Very large subscribers could\
    \ receive a /47 or slightly shorter\n         prefix, or multiple /48's.\n   \
    \   -  Mobile networks, such as vehicles or mobile phones with an\n         additional\
    \ network interface (such as bluetooth or 802.11b)\n         should receive a\
    \ static /64 prefix to allow the connection of\n         multiple devices through\
    \ one subnet.\n      -  A single PC, with no additional need to subnet, dialing-up\
    \ from\n         a hotel room may receive its /128 IPv6 address for a PPP style\n\
    \         connection as part of a /64 prefix.\n   Note that there seems to be\
    \ little benefit in not giving a /48 if\n   future growth is anticipated.  In\
    \ the following, we give the\n   arguments for a uniform use of /48 and then demonstrate\
    \ that it is\n   entirely compatible with responsible stewardship of the total\
    \ IPv6\n   address space.\n   The arguments for the fixed boundary are:\n    \
    \  -  That only by having a provider-independent boundary can we\n         guarantee\
    \ that a change of ISP will not require a costly\n         internal restructuring\
    \ or consolidation of subnets.\n      -  That during straightforward site renumbering\
    \ from one prefix to\n         another the whole process, including parallel running\
    \ of the\n         two prefixes, would be greatly complicated if the prefixes\
    \ had\n         different lengths (depending of course on the size and\n     \
    \    complexity of the site).\n      -  There are various possible approaches\
    \ to multihoming for IPv6\n         sites, including the techniques already used\
    \ for IPv4\n         multihoming.  The main open issue is finding solutions that\n\
    \         scale massively without unduly damaging route aggregation\n        \
    \ and/or optimal route selection.  Much more work remains to be\n         done\
    \ in this area, but it seems likely that several approaches\n         will be\
    \ deployed in practice, each with their own advantages\n         and disadvantages.\
    \  Some (but not all) will work better with a\n         fixed prefix boundary.\
    \  (Multihoming is discussed in more\n         detail below.)\n      -  To allow\
    \ easy growth of the subscribers' networks without need\n         to go back to\
    \ ISPs for more space (except for that relatively\n         small number of subscribers\
    \ for which a /48 is not enough).\n      -  To remove the burden from the ISPs\
    \ and registries of judging\n         sites' needs for address space, unless the\
    \ site requests more\n         space than a /48.  This carries several advantages:\n\
    \         -  It may become less critical for ISPs to be able to maintain\n   \
    \         detailed knowledge of their customers' network architecture\n      \
    \      and growth plans,\n         -  ISPs and registries may reduce the effort\
    \ spent on assessing\n            rates of address consumption, with address space\
    \ ample for\n            long-term growth plans,\n         -  Registry operations\
    \ may be made more efficient or more\n            focused, by reducing the urgency\
    \ of tracking and assessment.\n         -  Address space will no longer be a precious\
    \ resource for\n            customers, removing the major incentive for subscribers\
    \ to\n            install v6/v6 NATs, which would defeat the IPv6 restoration\n\
    \            of address transparency.\n      -  To allow the site to maintain\
    \ a single reverse-DNS zone\n         covering all prefixes.\n      -  If and\
    \ only if a site can use the same subnetting structure\n         under each of\
    \ its prefixes, then it can use the same zone file\n         for the address-to-name\
    \ mapping of all of them.  And, using the\n         conventions of [RFC2874],\
    \ it can roll the reverse mapping data\n         into the \"forward\" (name-keyed)\
    \ zone.\n   Specific advantages of the fixed boundary being at /48 include\n \
    \     -  To leave open the technical option of retro-fitting the GSE\n       \
    \  (Global, Site and End-System Designator, a.k.a., \"8+8\")\n         proposal\
    \ for separating locators and identifiers, which assumes\n         a fixed boundary\
    \ between global and site addressing at /48.\n         Although the GSE technique\
    \ was deferred a couple of years ago,\n         it still has strong proponents.\
    \  Also, the IRTF Namespace\n         Research Group is actively looking into\
    \ topics closely related\n         to GSE.  It is still possible that GSE or a\
    \ derivative of GSE\n         will be used with IPv6 in the future.\n      - \
    \ Since the site-local prefix is fec0::/48, global site prefixes\n         of\
    \ /48 will allow sites to easily maintain a trivial (identity)\n         mapping\
    \ between the global topology and the site-local topology\n         in the SLA\
    \ field.\n      -  Similarly, if the 6to4 proposal is widely deployed, migration\n\
    \         from a 6to4 prefix, which is /48 by construction, to a native\n    \
    \     IPv6 prefix will be simplified if the native prefix is /48.\n"
- title: 4. Conservation of Address Space
  contents:
  - "4. Conservation of Address Space\n   The question naturally arises whether giving\
    \ a /48 to every\n   subscriber represents a profligate waste of address space.\
    \  Objective\n   analysis shows that this is not the case.  A /48 prefix under\
    \ the 001\n   Global Unicast Address prefix contains 45 variable bits.  That is,\n\
    \   the number of available prefixes is 2 to the power 45 or about 35\n   trillion\
    \ (35,184,372,088,832).\n   More precisely,\n      -  [RFC1715] defines an \"\
    H ratio\" based on experience in address\n         space assignment in various\
    \ networks.  The H ratio varies\n         between 0 and 0.3, with larger values\
    \ denoting denser, more\n         efficient assignment.  Experience shows that\
    \ problems start to\n         occur when the H ratio becomes greater than 0.25.\
    \  At an H\n         ratio of 0.25, a 45 bit address space would have 178 billion\n\
    \         (178 thousand million) identifiers.\n            H = log10(178*10^9)\
    \ / 45 = 0.25\n         This means that we feel comfortable about the prospect\
    \ of\n         allocating 178 billions /48 prefixes under that scheme before\n\
    \         problems start to appear.  To understand how big that number\n     \
    \    is, one has to compare 178 billion to 10 billion, which is the\n        \
    \ projected population on earth in year 2050 (see\n         http://www.census.gov/ipc/www/world.html).\
    \  These numbers give\n         no grounds for concern provided that the ISPs,\
    \ under the\n         guidance of the RIRs, allocate /48's prudently, and that\
    \ the\n         IETF refrains from new recommendations that further reduce the\n\
    \         remaining 45 variable bits, unless a compelling requirement\n      \
    \   emerges.\n      -  We are highly confident in the validity of this analysis,\
    \ based\n         on experience with IPv4 and several other address spaces, and\n\
    \         on extremely ambitious scaling goals for the Internet amounting\n  \
    \       to an 80 bit address space *per person*.  Even so, being\n         acutely\
    \ aware of the history of under-estimating demand, the\n         IETF has reserved\
    \ more than 85% of the address space (i.e., the\n         bulk of the space not\
    \ under the 001 Global Unicast Address\n         prefix).  Therefore, if the analysis\
    \ does one day turn out to\n         be wrong, our successors will still have\
    \ the option of imposing\n         much more restrictive allocation policies on\
    \ the remaining 85%.\n         However, we must stress that vendors should not\
    \ encode any of\n         the boundaries discussed here either in software nor\
    \ hardware.\n         Under that assumption, should we ever have to use the remaining\n\
    \         85% of the address space, such a migration may not be devoid of\n  \
    \       pain, but it should be far less disruptive than deployment of a\n    \
    \     new version of IP.\n   To summarize, we argue that although careful stewardship\
    \ of IPv6\n   address space is essential, this is completely compatible with the\n\
    \   convenience and simplicity of a uniform prefix size for IPv6 sites of\n  \
    \ any size.  The numbers are such that there seems to be no objective\n   risk\
    \ of running out of space, giving an unfair amount of space to\n   early customers,\
    \ or of getting back into the over-constrained IPv4\n   situation where address\
    \ conservation and route aggregation damage\n   each other.\n"
- title: 5. Multihoming Issues
  contents:
  - "5. Multihoming Issues\n   In the realm of multi-homed networks, the techniques\
    \ used in IPv4 can\n   all be applied, but they have known scaling problems. \
    \ Specifically,\n   if the same prefix is advertised by multiple ISPs, the routing\n\
    \   information will grow as a function of the number of multihomed\n   sites.\
    \  To go beyond this for IPv6, we only have initial proposals on\n   the table\
    \ at this time, and active work is under way in the IETF IPNG\n   and Multi6 working\
    \ groups.  Until current or new proposals become\n   more fully developed, existing\
    \ techniques known to work in IPv4 will\n   continue to be used in IPv6.\n   Key\
    \ characteristics of an ideal multi-homing proposal include (at\n   minimum) that\
    \ it provides routing connectivity to any multi-homed\n   network globally, conserves\
    \ address space, produces high quality\n   routes via any of the network's providers,\
    \ enables a multi-homed\n   network to connect to multiple ISPs, does not unintentionally\
    \ bias\n   routing to use any proper subset of those networks, does not damage\n\
    \   route aggregation, and scales to very large numbers of multi-homed\n   networks.\n\
    \   One class of solutions being considered amounts to permanent parallel\n  \
    \ running of two (or more) prefixes per site.  In the absence of a\n   fixed prefix\
    \ boundary, such a site might be required to have multiple\n   different internal\
    \ subnet numbering strategies, (one for each prefix\n   length) or, if it only\
    \ wanted one, be forced to use the most\n   restrictive one as defined by the\
    \ longest prefix it received from any\n   of its ISPs.  In this approach, a multi-homed\
    \ network would have an\n   address block from each of its upstream providers.\
    \  Each host would\n   either have exactly one address picked from the set of\
    \ upstream\n   providers, or one address per host from each of the upstream\n\
    \   providers.  The first case is essentially a variant on [RFC2260],\n   with\
    \ known scaling limits.\n   In the second case (multiple addresses per host),\
    \ if two multi-homed\n   networks communicate, having respectively M and N upstream\
    \ providers,\n   then the one initiating the connection will select one address\
    \ pair\n   from the N*M potential address pairs to connect between, and in so\n\
    \   doing will select the providers, and therefore the applicable route,\n   for\
    \ the life of the connection.  Given that each path will have a\n   different\
    \ available bit rate, loss rate, and delay, if neither host\n   is in possession\
    \ of any routing or metric information, the initiating\n   host has only a 1/(M*N)\
    \ probability of selecting the optimal address\n   pair.  Work on better-than-random\
    \ address selection is in progress in\n   the IETF, but is incomplete.\n   The\
    \ existing IPv4 Internet shows us that a network prefix which is\n   independent\
    \ of, and globally advertised to, all upstream providers\n   permits the routing\
    \ system to select a reasonably good path within\n   the applicable policy.  Present-day\
    \ routing policies are not QoS\n   policies but reachability policies, which means\
    \ that they will not\n   necessarily select the optimal delay, bit rate, or loss\
    \ rate, but the\n   route will be the best within the metrics that are in use.\
    \  One may\n   therefore conclude that this would work correctly for IPv6 networks\n\
    \   as well, apart from scaling issues.\n"
