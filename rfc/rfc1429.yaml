- title: Abstract
  contents:
  - "Abstract\n   This memo specifies a subset of the distribution protocol used by\
    \ the\n   BITNET LISTSERV to deliver mail messages to large amounts of\n   recipients.\
    \  This protocol, known as DISTRIBUTE, optimizes the\n   distribution by sending\
    \ a single copy of the message over heavily\n   loaded links, insofar as topological\
    \ information is available to\n   guide such decisions, and reduces the average\
    \ turnaround time for\n   large mailing lists to 5-15 minutes on the average.\
    \ This memo\n   describes a simple interface allowing non-BITNET mailing list\n\
    \   exploders (or other bulk-delivery scripts) to take advantage of this\n   service\
    \ by letting the BITNET distribution network take care of the\n   delivery.\n"
- title: Introduction
  contents:
  - "Introduction\n   Running a mailing list of 1,000 subscribers or more with plain\n\
    \   \"sendmail\" while keeping turnaround time to a reasonable level is no\n \
    \  easy task. Due mostly to its limited bandwidth in the mid-80's,\n   BITNET\
    \ has developed an efficient bulk delivery protocol for its\n   mailing lists.\
    \ Originally introduced in 1986, this protocol was\n   refined little by little\
    \ and now carries 2-6 million mail messages a\n   day. In fact, this distribution\
    \ mechanism implements a general-\n   purpose delivery service which can be used\
    \ by any user of BITNET or\n   the Internet. Thus, a simple solution to the \"\
    sendmail\" turnaround\n   problem is to wrap the message and recipient list in\
    \ a DISTRIBUTE\n   envelope and pass it to a BITNET server for delivery.  This\
    \ may not\n   be the best possible solution, but it has the advantage of being\
    \ easy\n   to implement.\n   In this document we will use the term \"production\"\
    \ to refer to the\n   normal operation of the mailing list (or bulk delivery application)\n\
    \   you want to pipe through the DISTRIBUTE service. That is, the\n   \"production\"\
    \ options are those you should specify once everything is\n   tested and you are\
    \ confident that the setup is working to your\n   satisfaction. In contrast, \"\
    test\" and \"debug\" options can be used to\n   experiment with the protocol but\
    \ should not be used for normal\n   operation because of the additional bandwidth\
    \ and CPU time required\n   to generate the various informational reports.\n \
    \  Finally, it should be noted that the DISTRIBUTE protocol was\n   developed\
    \ to address a number of issues, some of them relevant only\n   to BITNET, and\
    \ has evolved since 1986 while keeping a compatible\n   syntax. For the sake of\
    \ brevity, this RFC describes only a small\n   subset of the available options\
    \ and syntax. This is why the syntax\n   may appear unnecessarily complicated\
    \ or even illogical.\n"
- title: 1. Selecting an entry point into the DISTRIBUTE backbone
  contents:
  - "1. Selecting an entry point into the DISTRIBUTE backbone\n   The first thing\
    \ you have to do is to find a suitable site to submit\n   your distributions to.\
    \ For testing, and for testing ONLY, you can\n   use:\n                      \
    \   LISTSERV@SEARN.SUNET.SE\n   For production use, however, you should select\
    \ a DISTRIBUTE site in\n   your topological vicinity: it would make no sense to\
    \ pass your\n   distributions from California to a server in Sweden if most of\
    \ your\n   recipients are in the US. If your organization is connected to BITNET\n\
    \   and your BITNET system is part of the DISTRIBUTE backbone, this ought\n  \
    \ to be your best bet. Otherwise you will want to contact someone\n   knowledgeable\
    \ about BITNET (or the author of this RFC if you have no\n   BITNET users). Make\
    \ sure to run through the following checklist\n   before sending any production\
    \ traffic to the site in question:\n   a. Do you have good connectivity to the\
    \ host in question? Does the\n      host, in general, have decent BITNET connectivity?\
    \ There are still\n      a few sites that insist on using 9.6k leased lines for\
    \ BITNET in\n      spite of having T1 IP access. You will want to avoid them.\n\
    \   b. Send mail to the server with \"show version\" in the message body\n   \
    \   (not in the subject field, which is ignored). Is the server running\n    \
    \  version 1.7f or higher? If so, it should not have given you the\n      following\
    \ warning,\n        >>> This server is configured to use PUNCH format for mail\
    \ <<<\n      which means that messages with lines longer than 80 characters\n\
    \      cannot be handled properly. If the software version is less than\n    \
    \  1.7f, the warning will not be present; instead, check the first\n      (bottom)\
    \ \"Received:\" field. If it does not say \"LMail\", do not use\n      this server\
    \ as it probably cannot handle messages with long lines.\n      Finally, make\
    \ sure that the \"Master nodes file\" is not older\n      than 2 months: there\
    \ are a handful of sites which never update\n      their tables due to staffing\
    \ problems. They cannot be prevented\n      from running LISTSERV, but you will\
    \ certainly want to avoid them.\n   c. How big is your workload? If you are planning\
    \ to use the service\n      for more than 10,000 daily recipients, you should\
    \ get permission\n      from the LISTSERV administrator, both as a matter of courtesy\
    \ and\n      to hear about any restrictions or regularly scheduled downtime they\n\
    \      might have. For instance, some universities might not allow large\n   \
    \   distributions during prime time, or they may have several\n      DISTRIBUTE\
    \ machines and will want to make sure you use the \"right\"\n      one.  Send\
    \ mail to \"owner-listserv\" at the host in question and\n      give an estimate\
    \ of the amount of daily messages and recipients you\n      would like to submit.\
    \ If your message bounces back with \"No such\n      local user\" or the like,\
    \ it means the server did not pass the above\n      test (b) and you don't want\
    \ to use it anyway.\n   An index of sites/hosts which have the required configuration,\
    \ good\n   connectivity, keep their tables up to date and have generally agreed\n\
    \   to provide this service to anyone in their topological area will be\n   published\
    \ separately in the future.\n"
- title: 2. Physical delivery of the DISTRIBUTE request
  contents:
  - "2. Physical delivery of the DISTRIBUTE request\n   The distribution request is\
    \ delivered via SMTP to the e-mail address\n   obtained in step 1 (for instance,\
    \ LISTSERV@SEARN.SUNET.SE). In fact,\n   as long as you can somehow get mail to\
    \ the server's host, you can use\n   the service; SMTP is just the most convenient\
    \ way of doing so.\n"
- title: '2.1. Contents of MAIL FROM: field'
  contents:
  - "2.1. Contents of MAIL FROM: field\n   You should set the MAIL FROM: field to\
    \ the address of the person who\n   maintains your mailing list or, generally\
    \ speaking, to the address of\n   a human being who can take action in case the\
    \ message fails to reach\n   the DISTRIBUTE server's host. This is a very rare\
    \ occurrence.\n"
- title: '2.2. Contents of RCPT TO: field'
  contents:
  - "2.2. Contents of RCPT TO: field\n   The RCPT TO: field points to the server's\
    \ address (for instance,\n   LISTSERV@SEARN.SUNET.SE).\n"
- title: 2.3. Contents of the RFC822 header
  contents:
  - "2.3. Contents of the RFC822 header\n   After the DATA instruction, you must supply\
    \ a valid RFC822 header\n   with a \"From:\" field pointing to the mailbox that\
    \ should receive\n   notification of delivery problems, bounced mail, and so on.\
    \ This can\n   be the same as the MAIL FROM: field, an address of the type \"\
    owner-\n   xxxx@yourhost\", etc.  DO NOT PUT THE LIST SUBMISSION ADDRESS THERE,\n\
    \   or you will get mailing loops.\n   For testing, the \"From:\" field should\
    \ point to your own mailbox, so\n   that you get the responses from the server.\n\
    \   As long as RFC822 syntax is respected, the only field that matters is\n  \
    \ the \"From:\" field (or \"Sender:\", \"Resent-From:\", etc.). In practice\n\
    \   this means you can just pipe the distribution request into \"mail\n   listserv@whatever\"\
    \ and let your mail program build all the headers.\n"
- title: 3. Format of the DISTRIBUTE request
  contents:
  - "3. Format of the DISTRIBUTE request\n   The body of the message delivered to\
    \ LISTSERV defines the recipients\n   of the distribution and the text (header\
    \ + body) of the RFC822\n   message you want to have delivered. The request starts\
    \ with a \"job\n   card\", followed by a DISTRIBUTE command, a list of recipients,\
    \ and\n   finally the message header and body.\n"
- title: 3.1. Syntax of the JOB card
  contents:
  - "3.1. Syntax of the JOB card\n   The purpose of the JOB card is to make sure that\
    \ any spurious text\n   inserted by mail gateways or the like is flushed and not\
    \ erroneously\n   interpreted as a command. It can optionally be used to associate\
    \ a\n   \"job name\" with the request, in case you want to use tools to assist\n\
    \   you in processing the notifications you get from the DISTRIBUTE\n   servers\
    \ when running in test mode. The syntax is as follows:\n   //jobname JOB ECHO=NO\n\
    \   \"jobname\" can be anything as long as it does not contain blanks, and\n \
    \  can be omitted. LISTSERV generally ignores case when parsing\n   commands,\
    \ so you can use \"job\" or \"Job\" if you prefer. The ECHO=NO\n   keyword is\
    \ required for production use, to suppress the \"resource\n   usage summary\"\
    \ you would otherwise get upon completion of your\n   delivery. You may want to\
    \ omit it when testing.\n"
- title: 3.2. Syntax of the DISTRIBUTE command
  contents:
  - "3.2. Syntax of the DISTRIBUTE command\n   Below the JOB card, you must supply\
    \ the following line:\n   DISTRIBUTE MAIL\n   For production mode, do not specify\
    \ anything else on that line. When\n   testing, you should add ACK=MAIL in order\
    \ to get an acknowledgement\n   confirming the delivery. There are two other useful\
    \ options:\n   DEBUG=YES, which instructs the server to produce a report showing\
    \ how\n   the various recipients will be routed, but without actually\n   delivering\
    \ the message; and TRACE=YES, which does the same but does\n   deliver the message.\
    \ Before making a \"live\" test with your actual\n   recipients list, you should\
    \ tack the DEBUG=YES option once to make\n   sure you got all the parameters and\
    \ syntax right, and get a rough\n   idea of the efficiency of the distribution\
    \ (see the section on\n   performance).\n"
- title: 3.3. Giving the list of recipients
  contents:
  - "3.3. Giving the list of recipients\n   The list of recipients follows the DISTRIBUTE\
    \ line and is specified\n   as follows:\n   //To DD *\n   user1@host1 BSMTP\n\
    \   user2@host2 BSMTP\n   /*\n   The two lines starting with a \"/\" have to be\
    \ copied as-is. Each of\n   the lines in between contains the address of one of\
    \ the recipients,\n   followed by a blank and by the word \"BSMTP\", which indicates\
    \ that you\n   do not want the header rewritten. There are four restrictions:\n\
    \   a. The address must be a plain \"local-part@hostname\" - no name string,\n\
    \      no angle bracket, no source route, etc. Bear in mind that the\n      DISTRIBUTE\
    \ server is not in the same domain as you: all the\n      addresses should be\
    \ fully qualified.\n   b. If the local-part is quoted, it must be quoted from\
    \ the first word\n      on.  Technically, RFC822 allows: Joe.\"Now@Home\".Smith@xyz.edu,\
    \ but\n      for performance reasons this form is not supported. Just quote the\n\
    \      first word to tell LISTSERV to run the address through the full\n     \
    \ parser: you would write \"Joe\".\"Now@Home\".Smith@xyz.edu instead.\n   c. The\
    \ local-part of the address may not start with an (unquoted)\n      asterisk.\
    \  You can bypass this restriction by quoting the local\n      part and using\
    \ a %-hack through the server's host:\n      \"***JACK***%jack-ws.xyz.edu\"@server-host.\n\
    \   d. Blanks are not allowed anywhere in the address.\n   You can use the pseudo-domain\
    \ \".BITNET\" for BITNET recipients: it is\n   always supported within DISTRIBUTE\
    \ requests.\n"
- title: 3.4. Specifying the message text
  contents:
  - "3.4. Specifying the message text\n   After the last recipient and the closing\
    \ \"/*\", add the following\n   line,\n   //Data DD *,EOF\n   followed by the\
    \ RFC822 message (header + body) that you want\n   delivered.  The EOF option\
    \ indicates that the message header and body\n   will extend until the end of\
    \ the message you are sending to the\n   DISTRIBUTE server.  If you are worried\
    \ about extraneous data being\n   appended by a gateway, remove the EOF option,\
    \ add a closing \"/*\" line\n   after the end of the message, followed by a \"\
    // EOJ\" card to flush\n   any remaining text. This, however, will fail if the\
    \ message itself\n   contains a \"/*\" line; you would have to insert a space\
    \ before any\n   such line.\n"

- title: 5. Performance
  contents:
  - "5. Performance\n   The efficiency of the distribution depends mostly on the quality\
    \ and\n   accuracy of the topological information available to the DISTRIBUTE\n\
    \   server (and, in some extreme cases, on system load). For BITNET\n   recipients,\
    \ the typical turnaround time for reasonably well connected\n   systems is 5-15\
    \ minutes. Internet recipients fall in two categories:\n   those which can be\
    \ routed to a machine within or close to the\n   recipient's organization (average\
    \ turnaround time 5-20 minutes), and\n   those for which no topological information\
    \ is available at all. In\n   that case the delivery can take much longer, but\
    \ usually remains\n   faster than with a vanilla sendmail setup. At the time being,\n\
    \   topological information is available for most top-level domains\n   outside\
    \ the US and for many sub-domains of EDU and GOV.\n   You can measure the efficiency\
    \ of the distribution using the\n   DEBUG=YES option as explained above. Recipients\
    \ which get forwarded\n   to another server usually get delivered within 5-20\
    \ minutes (except\n   to poorly connected sites or countries, for which not much\
    \ can be\n   done). Recipients which are handled locally are passed to a local\n\
    \   SMTP agent whose efficiency depends very much on the amount of\n   \"burst\"\
    \ queries the local name server can handle in quick succession.\n   A number of\
    \ projects are currently underway to investigate the\n   feasibility of improving\
    \ the quality of the topological information\n   available to the DISTRIBUTE servers\
    \ for the Internet.\n"
