- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   This specification uses the concepts and definitions from\
    \ the high\n   level requirements [14] and the SIP conferencing framework [8]\n\
    \   documents.  This approach is applicable to tightly coupled SIP\n   conferences.\
    \  In this architecture, a user agent (UA), known as a\n   participant, establishes\
    \ a SIP dialog with another UA, known as a\n   focus.  The focus is the central\
    \ point of control, authentication,\n   and authorization.  This specification\
    \ defines the operation of a\n   focus and participant UAs.  Note that only the\
    \ signalling (SIP) needs\n   to be centralized in this model; the media can be\
    \ centrally mixed,\n   distributed, or even multicast.  For a full discussion\
    \ of this\n   architecture, see the SIP conferencing framework document [8].\n\
    \   The approach described in this document implements key functions in\n   the\
    \ conferencing framework using SIP primitives only.  This allows\n   for conducting\
    \ simple conferences with defined functionalities using\n   SIP mechanisms and\
    \ conventions.  Many other advanced functions can be\n   implemented using additional\
    \ means, but they are not in the scope of\n   this document.\n   This document\
    \ presents the basic call control (dial-in and dial-out)\n   conferencing building\
    \ blocks from the UA perspective.  Possible\n   applications include ad-hoc conferences\
    \ and scheduled conferences.\n   Note that a single conference can bridge participants\
    \ that have\n   different capabilities and who potentially have joined the conference\n\
    \   by different means (i.e., dial-in, dial-out, scheduled, or ad-hoc).\n   The\
    \ call control and dialog manipulation approach is based on the\n   multiparty\
    \ framework document [15].  That document defines the basic\n   approach of service\
    \ design adopted for SIP, which includes the\n   following:\n    - Definition\
    \ of primitives, not services\n    - Signaling model independent\n    - Invoker\
    \ oriented\n    - Primitives make full use of URIs\n    - Include policies for\
    \ authentication, authorization, logging, etc.\n    - Define graceful fallback\
    \ to baseline SIP\n   The use of opaque URIs and the ability to communicate call\
    \ control\n   context information within a URI (as opposed to using service-related\n\
    \   header fields), as discussed in RFC 3087 [11], is fundamental to this\n  \
    \ approach.\n   Capabilities discovery is an important feature of SIP systems,\
    \ and\n   conferencing systems can make use of such features.  For a UA acting\n\
    \   as a focus in a conference, this specification defines the usage of\n   the\
    \ 'isfocus' feature parameter.\n"

    REQUIRED\",\n   \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\", \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\"\
    , \"MAY\",\n   and \"OPTIONAL\" are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119\
    \ and\n   indicate requirement levels for compliant implementations [1].\n"

  contents:
  - "3.  SIP User Agent Conferencing Capability Types\n   From a conferencing perspective,\
    \ the framework document outlines a\n   number of possible different SIP components\
    \ such as conference-\n   unaware participant, conference-aware participant, and\
    \ focus.\n   This document applies the concepts above to the SIP call control\
    \ part\n   of the conferencing components.  It defines normative behavior of the\n\
    \   SIP UAs in various conferencing situations (referred to later as\n   \"scenarios\"\
    ).\n"
- title: 3.1.  Focus UA
  contents:
  - "3.1.  Focus UA\n   A focus, as defined in the framework, hosts a SIP conference\
    \ and\n   maintains a SIP signaling relationship with each participant in the\n\
    \   conference.  A focus contains a conference-aware user agent that\n   supports\
    \ the conferencing call control conventions as defined in this\n   document.\n\
    \   A focus SHOULD support the conference package RFC 4575 [9], behave as\n  \
    \ a notifier for that package, and indicate its support in the Allow-\n   Events\
    \ header fields in requests and responses.  A focus MAY include\n   information\
    \ about the conference in Session Description Protocol\n   (SDP) bodies sent as\
    \ part of normal SIP signaling by populating the\n   Session Information, URI,\
    \ Email Address, and Phone Number SDP fields.\n   In order to support advanced\
    \ features, where a session established\n   between two endpoints can migrate\
    \ to a centralized conference, a\n   focus SHOULD support the Replaces header\
    \ field [6].\n   A user agent with focus capabilities could be implemented in\
    \ end user\n   equipment and would be used for the creation of ad-hoc conferences.\n\
    \   A dedicated conferencing server, whose primary task is to\n   simultaneously\
    \ host conferences of arbitrary type and size, may\n   allocate and publish a\
    \ conference factory URI (as defined in the next\n   section) for creating an\
    \ arbitrary number of ad-hoc conferences (and\n   subsequently their focuses)\
    \ using SIP call control means.\n"
- title: 3.2.  Conference Factory URI
  contents:
  - "3.2.  Conference Factory URI\n   According to the framework, there are many ways\
    \ in which a conference\n   can be created.  A conferencing server implementation\
    \ is free to\n   choose from these methods, which include non-automated means\
    \ (such as\n   an Interactive Voice Response (IVR) system), SIP, or any conference\n\
    \   control protocol.\n   In order to automatically create an arbitrary number\
    \ of ad-hoc\n   conferences (and subsequently their focuses) using SIP call control\n\
    \   means, a globally routable Conference Factory URI can be allocated\n   and\
    \ published.\n   A successful attempt to establish a call to this URI would result\
    \ in\n   the automatic creation of a new conference and its focus.  As a\n   result,\
    \ note that the Conference Factory URI and the newly created\n   focus URI MAY\
    \ resolve to different physical devices.\n   A scenario showing the use of the\
    \ conference factory URI is shown in\n   Section 5.4.\n"
- title: 3.3.  Conference-Unaware UA
  contents:
  - "3.3.  Conference-Unaware UA\n   The simplest user agent can participate in a\
    \ conference ignoring all\n   SIP conferencing-related information.  The simplest\
    \ user agent is\n   able to dial in to a conference and to be invited to a conference.\n\
    \   Any conferencing information is optionally conveyed to/from it using\n   non-SIP\
    \ means.  Such a user agent would not usually host a conference\n   (at least,\
    \ not using SIP explicitly).  A conference-unaware UA need\n   only support RFC\
    \ 3261 [2].  Call flows for conference-unaware UAs are\n   not shown in general\
    \ in this document as they would be identical to\n   those in the SIP call flows\
    \ document [13].\n   Note that the presence of an 'isfocus' feature tag in a Contact\n\
    \   header field will not cause interoperability issues between a focus\n   and\
    \ a conference-unaware UA since it will be treated as an unknown\n   header parameter\
    \ and ignored, as per standard SIP behavior.\n"
- title: 3.4.  Conference-Aware UA
  contents:
  - "3.4.  Conference-Aware UA\n   A conference-aware user agent supports SIP conferencing\
    \ call control\n   conventions defined in this document as a conference participant,\
    \ in\n   addition to support of RFC 3261 [2].  A conference-aware UA should be\n\
    \   able to process SIP redirections such as described in Section 8.1.3.4\n  \
    \ of RFC 3261.\n   A conference-aware UA MUST recognize the 'isfocus' feature\
    \ parameter.\n   A conference-aware UA SHOULD support REFER [4], SIP events [3],\
    \ and\n   the conferencing package [9].\n   A conference-aware UA SHOULD subscribe\
    \ to the conference package if\n   the 'isfocus' parameter is in the remote target\
    \ URI of a dialog and\n   if the conference package is listed by a focus in an\
    \ Allow-Events\n   header field.  The SUBSCRIBE to the conference package SHOULD\
    \ be sent\n   outside any INVITE-initiated dialog.  A termination of the INVITE\n\
    \   dialog with a BYE does not necessarily terminate the SUBSCRIBE\n   dialog.\n\
    \   A conference-aware UA MAY render to the user any information about\n   the\
    \ conference obtained from the SIP header fields and SDP fields\n   from the focus.\n\
    \   A conference-aware UA SHOULD render to the user any information about\n  \
    \ the conference obtained from the SIP conference package.\n"

- title: 4.1.  General
  contents:
  - "4.1.  General\n   The main design guidelines for the development of SIP extensions\
    \ and\n   conventions for conferencing are to define the minimum number of\n \
    \  extensions and to have seamless backward compatibility with\n   conference-unaware\
    \ SIP UAs.  The minimal requirement for SIP is being\n   able to express that\
    \ a dialog is a part of a certain conference\n   referenced to by a URI.  As a\
    \ result of these extensions, it is\n   possible to do the following using SIP:\n\
    \    - Create a conference\n    - Join a conference\n    - Invite a user to a\
    \ conference\n    - Expel a user by third party\n    - Discover if a URI is a\
    \ conference URI\n    - Delete a conference\n   The approach taken is to use the\
    \ feature parameter 'isfocus' to\n   express that a SIP dialog belongs to a conference.\
    \  The use of\n   feature parameters in Contact header fields to describe the\n\
    \   characteristics and capabilities of a UA is described in the User\n   Agent\
    \ Capabilities document [5], which includes the definition of the\n   'isfocus'\
    \ feature parameter.\n"
- title: 4.2.  Session Establishment
  contents:
  - "4.2.  Session Establishment\n   In session establishment, a focus MUST include\
    \ the 'isfocus' feature\n   parameter in the Contact header field unless the focus\
    \ wishes to hide\n   the fact that it is a focus.  To a participant, the feature\
    \ parameter\n   will be associated with the remote target URI of the dialog. \
    \ It is\n   an indication to a conference-aware UA that the resulting dialog\n\
    \   belongs to a conference, identified by the URI in the Contact header\n   field,\
    \ and that the call control conventions defined in this document\n   can be applied.\n\
    \   By their nature, the conferences supported by this specification are\n   centralized.\
    \  Therefore, typically a conferencing system needs to\n   allocate a SIP conference\
    \ URI such that SIP requests to this URI are\n   not forked and are routed to\
    \ a dedicated conference focus.  For\n   example, a globally accessible SIP conference\
    \ could be well\n   constructed with a conference URI using a Globally Routable\
    \ User\n   Agent URI (GRUU) (defined in [16]), because of its ability to support\n\
    \   the non-forking and global routability requirements.\n"
- title: 4.3.  Discovery
  contents:
  - "4.3.  Discovery\n   Using the mechanism described in this section, it is possible,\
    \ given\n   an opaque URI, to determine if it belongs to a certain conference\n\
    \   (i.e., meaning that it is a conference URI) or not.  This discovery\n   function\
    \ can be implemented in SIP using an OPTIONS request, and can\n   be done either\
    \ inside an active dialog or outside a dialog.  A focus\n   MUST include the 'isfocus'\
    \ feature parameter in a 200 OK response to\n   an OPTIONS unless the focus wishes\
    \ to hide the fact that it is a\n   focus.\n"
- title: 5.  SIP Conferencing Primitives
  contents:
  - "5.  SIP Conferencing Primitives\n   The SIP conferencing call control flows presented\
    \ in this section are\n   the call control building blocks for various SIP conferencing\n\
    \   applications as described in the conferencing requirements [14] and\n   framework\
    \ [8] documents.  The major design goal is that the same SIP\n   conferencing\
    \ primitives would be used by user agents having different\n   conferencing capabilities\
    \ and implementing different applications.\n"
- title: '5.1.  INVITE: Joining a Conference Using the Conference URI - Dial-In'
  contents:
  - "5.1.  INVITE: Joining a Conference Using the Conference URI - Dial-In\n   In\
    \ this section, a user knows the conference URI and \"dials in\" to\n   join this\
    \ conference.  The focus will authenticate the participant\n   and apply authorization\
    \ policy before allowing the participant to\n   join the conference.\n   If the\
    \ UA is the first participant of the conference to dial-in, it\n   is likely that\
    \ this INVITE will activate the focus and hence the\n   conference.  However,\
    \ the conference URI must have been reserved\n   prior to its use.\n   If the\
    \ conference is up and running already, the dialing-in\n   participant is joined\
    \ to the conference by its focus.\n   To join an existing specific conference,\
    \ a UA will send an INVITE\n   with the Request-URI set to the conference URI.\
    \  The focus MUST\n   include the 'isfocus' feature parameter in the Contact header\

  - "5.2.  INVITE: Adding a Participant by the Focus - Dial-Out\n   To directly add\
    \ a participant to a conference, a focus SHOULD send an\n   INVITE to the participant\
    \ containing a Contact header field with the\n   conference URI and the 'isfocus'\
    \ feature parameter.\n   Note that a conference-unaware UA would simply ignore\
    \ the\n   conferencing information and treat the session (from a SIP\n   perspective)\
    \ as a point-to-point session.  This is because standard\n   RFC 3261 [2] behavior\
    \ is to ignore unknown header parameters such as\n   'isfocus'.\n   An example\
    \ call flow is shown in Figure 2.  It is assumed that Alice\n   is already a participant\
    \ of the conference.  The focus invites Carol\n   to the conference by sending\
    \ an INVITE.  After the session is\n   established, Carol subscribes to the conference\
    \ URI.  It is important\n   to note that there is no dependency on Carol's SUBSCRIBE\
    \ (F5) and the\n   NOTIFY to Alice (F9) -- they occur asynchronously and independently.\n\

  contents:
  - "5.3.  INVITE: Manually Creating a Conference by Dialing in to a\n      Conferencing\
    \ Application\n   In this section, a user sends an INVITE to a conference server\n\
    \   application.  The application (such as an IVR system or a web page)\n   is\
    \ implemented because the system requires additional input from the\n   user before\
    \ it is able to create a conference.  After a normal dialog\n   is established,\
    \ additional information is received and the conference\n   together with its\
    \ focus are created.  Since the UA is now in a dialog\n   with a focus, the focus\
    \ will re-INVITE the user with the conference\n   URI in Contact with the 'isfocus'\
    \ feature parameter.\n   Alternatively, the additional information can be provided\
    \ by the user\n   during an early dialog (see RFC 3261 [2] for a discussion of\
    \ early\n   dialogs in SIP).  This could be accomplished by a 183 Session\n  \
    \ Progress response sent by the conferencing application.  After the\n   conference\
    \ is created, the conference URI would then be returned in a\n   Contact in the\
    \ 200 OK.\n   Note that since this flow is all about human interaction with a\n\
    \   conferencing application, any errors and failures will be returned to\n  \
    \ the human (recorded announcements, error tones, etc.).\n   As discussed in the\
    \ conferencing framework, the conference URI must\n   be unique across all distinct\
    \ conferences within the same domain.  In\n   general, the user part of a conference\
    \ URI will contain a pseudo\n   random string.\n   An example call flow is shown\
    \ in Figure 3.  In this example, Alice\n   uses a conference application that\
    \ is triggered when Alice sends an\n   INVITE to the conference application. \
    \ In this example, Conf-App is\n   used to represent the conference application\
    \ URI.  Alice's\n   conference-aware UA learns of the existence of the conference\
    \ from\n   the 'isfocus' feature parameter and subscribes to the conference\n\
    \   package to receive notifications of the conference state.\n   Alice      \

  - "5.4.  INVITE: Creating a Conference Using Ad-Hoc SIP Methods\n   This section\
    \ addresses creating a conference by using ad-hoc SIP\n   means.  The conference\
    \ factory URI (as defined in Section 3.2) is\n   used to automatically create\
    \ the conference in this example.  This is\n   different from the previous scenario\
    \ in that no human intervention is\n   required -- an automaton can create the\
    \ conference and add\n   participants.  Since the conference does not need to\
    \ be scheduled or\n   reserved, but is created \"on the fly\", it is an \"ad-hoc\"\
    \ conference\n   creation.\n   The benefit of this approach is that the conference\
    \ URI need not be\n   known to the user; instead it is created by a focus and\
    \ used by the\n   participants' UAs.  The main difference between this scenario\
    \ and\n   Section 5.3 is that no user intervention (IVR, web page form, etc.)\n\
    \   is required to create the conference.\n   The SIP URI of the conference factory\
    \ can be provisioned in the UA\n   (as in a \"create new conference\" button on\
    \ a SIP phone) or can be\n   discovered using other means.\n   A SIP entity (such\
    \ as conferencing server) can distinguish this\n   INVITE request as a request\
    \ to create a new ad-hoc conference from a\n   request to join an existing conference\
    \ by the Request-URI.  That is,\n   although both requests may route to the same\
    \ application, the\n   differing services requested can be identified by the differing\
    \ URIs\n   in the request itself.\n   Assuming that all security and policy requirements\
    \ have been met, a\n   new conference will be created with the Contact URI returned\
    \ in the\n   200 OK being the conference URI.  The Contact header field MUST\n\
    \   contain the 'isfocus' feature parameter to indicate that this URI is\n   for\
    \ a conference.\n   An example call flow is shown in Figure 4.  Note that Conf-Factory\
    \ is\n   shorthand for the conference factory URI and Conf-ID Is short for the\n\
    \   conference URI.  In this flow, Alice has a conference-aware UA and\n   creates\
    \ a conference by sending an INVITE to the conference factory\n   URI.  The conference\
    \ factory application creates the conference and\n   redirects Alice to the focus\
    \ using a 302 Moved Temporarily response.\n   Note that with proxy recursion as\
    \ part of normal RFC 3261 [2]\n   behavior, Alice may never see the redirect but\
    \ may just receive the\n   responses from the focus starting with message F5.\
    \  Once the media\n   session is established, Alice subscribes to the conference\
    \ URI\n   obtained through the Contact in the 200 OK response from the focus.\n\

  contents:
  - "5.5.  REFER: Requesting a Focus to Add a New Resource to a Conference\n     \
    \ (Dial Out to a New Participant)\n   A SIP conference URI can be used to inject\
    \ different kinds of\n   information into the conference.  Examples include new\
    \ participants,\n   new real-time media sources, new IM messages, and pointers\
    \ to passive\n   information references (such as HTTP URIs).\n   To request that\
    \ the focus add a new information resource to the\n   specified conference, any\
    \ SIP UA can send a REFER to the conference\n   URI with a Refer-To containing\
    \ the URI of the new resource.  Since\n   this REFER is sent to the conference\
    \ URI and not the conference\n   factory URI, the semantics to the focus are to\
    \ bring the resource\n   into the conference and make it visible to the conference\n\
    \   participants.  The resultant focus procedures are dependent both on\n   the\
    \ nature of the new resource (as expressed by its URI) and the\n   policy of the\
    \ focus regarding IM, central vs. distributed real-time\n   media processing,\
    \ and so on.\n   The scenario for adding a new UA participant is important to\
    \ support\n   because it works even if the new participant does not support REFER\n\
    \   and transfer call control -- only the requesting participant and the\n   focus\
    \ need to support the REFER and transfer call control.\n   Upon receipt of the\
    \ REFER containing a Refer-To header with a SIP\n   URI, the focus SHOULD send\
    \ an INVITE to the new participant\n   identified by the Refer-To SIP URI containing\
    \ a Contact header field\n   with the conference URI and the 'isfocus' feature\
    \ parameter.\n   A conference-unaware UA would simply ignore the conferencing\n\
    \   information and treat the session (from a SIP perspective) as a\n   point-to-point\
    \ session.\n   An example call flow is shown in Figure 5.  While this flow shows\
    \ the\n   use of REFER to add a new participant to the conference, the\n   mechanism\
    \ can generally add a resource as identified by a URI to the\n   conference. \
    \ It is assumed that Alice is already a participant of the\n   conference.  Alice\
    \ sends a REFER to the conference URI.  The focus\n   invites Carol to the conference\
    \ by sending an INVITE.  After the\n   session is established, Carol subscribes\
    \ to the conference URI.  It\n   is important to note that there is no dependency\
    \ on Carol's SUBSCRIBE\n   (F11) and the NOTIFY to Alice (F15) -- they occur asynchronously\
    \ and\n   independently.\n   Alice                Focus                 Bob  \

    \   Dialog Identifier\n   Under some circumstances, a participant wanting to join\
    \ a conference\n   may only know a dialog identifier of one of the legs of the\n\
    \   conference.  The information may have been learned using the dialog\n   package\
    \ [18] or some non-SIP means to retrieve this information from\n   another conference\
    \ participant.\n   A UA can request to be added to a conference by sending a request\
    \ to\n   the focus containing a Join [7] header field containing a dialog ID\n\
    \   of one leg of the conference (a dialog between another participant\n   and\
    \ the focus).\n   There are other scenarios in which a UA can use the Join header\
    \ for\n   certain conferencing call control scenarios.  See [7] for further\n\
    \   examples and details.\n   An example is shown in Figure 8.  It is assumed\
    \ that Alice is a\n   participant of the conference.  The dialog identifier between\
    \ Alice\n   and the focus is abbreviated as A-F and is known by Bob.  Bob\n  \

  - "5.9.  Replaces Header Field: Switching User Agents within a Conference\n   Participants\
    \ in a conference may want to change the user agent (i.e.,\n   the endpoint or\
    \ the device) with which they participate in the\n   conference.  This could be\
    \ done by simply sending a BYE from one user\n   agent to leave the conference\
    \ and an INVITE from the other user agent\n   to rejoin.  However, the SIP Replaces\
    \ [6] primitive is perfectly\n   suited to this operation.\n   An example is shown\
    \ in Figure 9.  It is assumed that Alice is a\n   participant of the conference\
    \ using user agent #1.  The dialog\n   identifier between Alice's user agent #1\
    \ and the focus is abbreviated\n   as A-F.  Alice switches to user agent #2 and\
    \ sends an INVITE message\n   F1 to the focus containing a Replaces header that\
    \ contains the dialog\n   identifier A-F.  Note that this dialog identifier could\
    \ be learned\n   through some non-SIP mechanism, or by use of SUBSCRIBE/NOTIFY\
    \ and the\n   dialog event package [18].  Alice's user agent #2 is added into\
    \ the\n   conference by the focus.  The focus sends a BYE to user agent #1.\n\
    \   User agent #1 then automatically terminates the subscription by\n   sending\
    \ a SUBSCRIBE with Expires:0 to terminate the subscription.\n   Note that the\
    \ participant list (roster) has not necessarily changed\n   during this scenario,\
    \ unless detailed information about Alice user\n   agents (i.e. endpoints) is\
    \ included in the conference state\n   notifications.  For a full discussion of\
    \ conference package\n   notifications, refer to [9].\n   Alice UA#1         \

- title: 6.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "6.  Security Considerations\n   This specification defines the interaction between\
    \ a focus UA and a\n   participant UA in a conferencing application.  As a result,\
    \ the\n   security considerations and mechanisms defined in RFC 3261 [2] apply.\n\
    \   However, there are some aspects unique to conferencing that will be\n   discussed\
    \ here.\n   A conference often involves the use of substantial network bandwidth\n\
    \   and computing resources.  As a result, authentication is even more\n   important\
    \ than in a simple peer-to-peer session.  As discussed in the\n   conferencing\
    \ framework [8], conferences often have policy related to\n   conferencing resources.\
    \  A focus SHOULD authenticate participants\n   before joining them to a conference\
    \ and allowing utilization of\n   conferencing resources.  Different policies\
    \ can be applied by a focus\n   to different participants based on the result\
    \ of authentication.\n   A participant will be interacting with a number of other\
    \ participants\n   through the focus.  As a result, a participant should authenticate\n\
    \   the focus and be sure that the focus used for the conference is\n   trusted.\
    \  Normal SIP authentication mechanisms are suitable for\n   participant and focus\
    \ authentication, such as SIP Digest utilizing a\n   shared secret, or certificates,\
    \ or a secured SIP identity mechanism.\n   In addition, a focus SHOULD support\
    \ Secure SIP connections so that\n   hop-by-hop mutual authentication and confidentiality\
    \ provided by TLS\n   can be achieved.\n   In the SIP dialog between them, a focus\
    \ utilizes the 'isfocus'\n   feature tag to indicate that the UA is acting as\
    \ a focus.  As such,\n   the SIP header fields such as Contact SHOULD have end\
    \ to end\n   integrity.  A participant and focus SHOULD support an end-to-end\n\
    \   integrity mechanism such as S/MIME.\n   Once a participant has learned that\
    \ the other UA is a focus, SIP call\n   control operations (such as REFER) can\
    \ be implemented, or a\n   subscription to the conference package of the focus\
    \ might be\n   attempted.  The security considerations described in RFC 3515 [4]\n\
    \   apply to any REFER call control operations.  A focus and participant\n   will\
    \ apply policy to determine which call control operations are\n   allowed.\n \
    \  A focus accepting subscriptions to the conference package must follow\n   the\
    \ security considerations in RFC 4575 [9].  Since notifications can\n   carry\
    \ sensitive information, the subscriptions should be\n   authenticated and the\
    \ notifications delivered with confidentiality\n   and integrity protection. \
    \ Since a participant is not able to\n   authenticate other participants directly,\
    \ a participant must rely on\n   the focus to perform this authentication.\n \
    \  A focus MUST support a participant's request for privacy, either\n   through\
    \ conference policy or as expressed through the signaling.  For\n   example, a\
    \ participant joining a conference and including a Privacy\n   header field [10]\
    \ must not have identity information revealed to\n   other participants by the\
    \ focus.  If other signaling protocols are\n   used, privacy signaled through\
    \ them also must be respected.\n"

- title: 'Appendix A: Creating a Conference by a Conference-Unaware UA'
  contents:
  - "Appendix A: Creating a Conference by a Conference-Unaware UA\n   This section\
    \ discusses how a human user operating a conference-\n   unaware UA can create\
    \ and add participants to a conference.  This\n   method is described as an appendix\
    \ since it is NOT RECOMMENDED.  The\n   scenarios involving creating a conference\
    \ using ad-hoc or manual\n   means are recommended over this scenario.  This scenario\
    \ is included,\n   however, for completeness.\n   A user (human) would choose\
    \ a conference URI according to system\n   rules and insert it into the Request-URI\
    \ of the INVITE.  This same\n   URI is echoed by a focus adhering to certain addressing\
    \ conventions\n   (discussed below) in the Contact header by the focus.  Additional\n\
    \   participants could be added by non-SIP means (publication of the\n   chosen\
    \ conference URI using web pages, email, IM, etc.).\n   Alternatively, the conference-unaware\
    \ UA could then add other\n   participants to the conference using SIP call control\
    \ by establishing\n   a session with them, then transferring [17] them to the\
    \ conference\n   URI.  Note that in this scenario only the user (human) is aware\
    \ of\n   the conferencing application, and the conference-unaware UA only need\n\
    \   support RFC 3261 [2] and optionally call transfer.\n   Making this work does\
    \ impose certain addressing conventions on a\n   system.  As a service/implementation\
    \ choice, a system could allow the\n   creator of the conference to choose the\
    \ user portion of the\n   conference URI.  However, this requires the URI format\
    \ to be agreed\n   upon between a user and the system.\n   For example, a service\
    \ provider might reserve the domain\n   conf.example.com for all conference URIs.\
    \  Any URI in the domain of\n   conf.example.com would resolve to the focus. \
    \ The focus could be\n   configured to interpret an unknown user part in the conf.example.com\n\
    \   domain as a request for a conference to be created with the\n   conference\
    \ URI as the Request-URI.  For example, an INVITE sent with\n   a Request-URI\
    \ of sip:k32934208ds72@conf.example.com could be routed\n   to the focus that\
    \ would then create the conference.  This conference\n   URI should be registered\
    \ by the newly created focus to become\n   routable as a conference URI within\
    \ the conf.example.com domain.  The\n   returned Contact would look as follows:\n\
    \        Contact: <sip:k32934208ds72@conf.example.com>;isfocus\n   Note, however,\
    \ that this approach relies on conventions adopted\n   between the user (human)\
    \ and the focus.  Also, the approach is not\n   robust against collisions in the\
    \ conference names.  If a second user\n   wishing to create a new conference happened\
    \ to choose the same user\n   part as an existing conference, the result would\
    \ be that the second\n   user would be added into the existing conference instead\
    \ of creating\n   a new one.\n   As a result, methods of conference creation in\
    \ which the conference\n   URI is an opaque URI generated by the focus are preferred.\n\
    \   An example call flow is shown in Figure 14.  The participant Alice\n   creates\
    \ the conference URI (using some convention agreed to with the\n   focus domain)\
    \ and sends an INVITE to that URI which creates the\n   focus.  The focus creates\
    \ the conference and returns the same\n   conference URI in the 200 OK answer\
    \ to the INVITE (which is ignored\n   by the conference-unaware UA).\n   Alice\
