    \ is the\n   common set of MPLS protocol functions defined to meet the\n   requirements\
    \ specified in [RFC5654].  The MPLS-TP Framework [RFC5921]\n   provides an overall\
    \ introduction to the MPLS-TP and defines the\n   general architecture of the\
    \ Transport Profile, as well as the aspects\n   specific to point-to-point transport\
    \ paths.  The purpose of this\n   document is to define the elements and functions\

- title: 2.  Applicability
  contents:
  - "2.  Applicability\n   The point-to-multipoint connectivity provided by an MPLS-TP\
    \ network\n   is based on the point-to-multipoint connectivity provided by MPLS\n\
    \   networks.  Traffic Engineered P2MP LSP support is discussed in\n   [RFC4875]\
    \ and [RFC5332], and P2MP PW support is being developed based\n   on [P2MP-PW-REQS]\
    \ and [VPMS-FRMWK-REQS].  MPLS-TP point-to-multipoint\n   connectivity is analogous\
    \ to that provided by traditional transport\n   technologies such as Optical Transport\
    \ Network point-to-multipoint\n   [G.798] and drop-and-continue [G.780], and thus\
    \ supports the same\n   class of traditional applications, e.g., video distribution.\n\
    \   The scope of this document is limited to point-to-multipoint\n   functions\
    \ and it does not discuss multipoint-to-multipoint support.\n"
- title: 3.  MPLS-TP P2MP Requirements
  contents:
  - "3.  MPLS-TP P2MP Requirements\n   The requirements for MPLS-TP are specified\
    \ in [RFC5654], [RFC5860],\n   and [RFC5951].  This section provides a brief summary\
    \ of point-to-\n   multipoint transport requirements as set out in those documents;\
    \ the\n   reader is referred to the documents themselves for the definitive and\n\
    \   complete list of requirements.  This summary does not include the RFC\n  \
    \ 2119 [BCP14] conformance language used in the original documents as\n   this\
    \ document is not authoritative.\n   From [RFC5654]:\n   o  MPLS-TP must support\
    \ traffic-engineered point-to-multipoint\n      transport paths.\n   o  MPLS-TP\
    \ must support unidirectional point-to-multipoint transport\n      paths.\n  \
    \ o  MPLS-TP must be capable of using P2MP server (sub)layer\n      capabilities\
    \ as well as P2P server (sub)layer capabilities when\n      supporting P2MP MPLS-TP\
    \ transport paths.\n   o  The MPLS-TP control plane must support establishing\
    \ all the\n      connectivity patterns defined for the MPLS-TP data plane (i.e.,\n\
    \      unidirectional P2P, associated bidirectional P2P, co-routed\n      bidirectional\
    \ P2P, unidirectional P2MP) including configuration of\n      protection functions\
    \ and any associated maintenance functions.\n   o  Recovery techniques used for\
    \ P2P and P2MP should be identical to\n      simplify implementation and operation.\n\
    \   o  Unidirectional 1+1 and 1:n protection for P2MP connectivity must\n    \
    \  be supported.\n   o  MPLS-TP recovery in a ring must protect unidirectional\
    \ P2MP\n      transport paths.\n   From [RFC5860]:\n   o  The protocol solution(s)\
    \ developed to perform the following OAM\n      functions must also apply to point-to-point\
    \ associated\n      bidirectional LSPs, point-to-point unidirectional LSPs, and\

    \      *  Route Tracing\n      *  Diagnostic Tests\n      *  Remote Defect Indication\n\
    \   From [RFC5951]:\n   o  For unidirectional (P2P and point-to-multipoint (P2MP))\n\
    \      connection, proactive measurement of packet loss and loss ratio is\n  \
    \    required.\n   o  For a unidirectional (P2P and P2MP) connection, on-demand\n\
    \      measurement of delay measurement is required.\n"
- title: 4.  Architecture
  contents:
  - "4.  Architecture\n   The overall architecture of the MPLS-TP is defined in [RFC5921].\
    \  The\n   architecture for point-to-multipoint MPLS-TP comprises the following\n\
    \   additional elements and functions:\n   o  Unidirectional point-to-multipoint\
    \ LSPs\n   o  Unidirectional point-to-multipoint PWs\n   o  Optional point-to-multipoint\
    \ LSP and PW control planes\n   o  Survivability, network management, and Operations,\
    \ Administration,\n      and Maintenance functions for point-to-multipoint PWs\
    \ and LSPs.\n   The following subsection summarises the encapsulation and forwarding\n\
    \   of point-to-multipoint traffic within an MPLS-TP network, and the\n   encapsulation\
    \ options for delivery of traffic to and from MPLS-TP CE\n   devices when the\
    \ network is providing a packet transport service.\n"
- title: 4.1.  MPLS-TP Encapsulation and Forwarding
  contents:
  - "4.1.  MPLS-TP Encapsulation and Forwarding\n   Packet encapsulation and forwarding\
    \ for MPLS-TP point-to-multipoint\n   LSPs is identical to that for MPLS-TE point-to-multipoint\
    \ LSPs.\n   MPLS-TE point-to-multipoint LSPs were introduced in [RFC4875] and\
    \ the\n   related data-plane behaviour was further clarified in [RFC5332].\n \
    \  MPLS-TP allows for both upstream-assigned and downstream-assigned\n   labels\
    \ for use with point-to-multipoint LSPs.\n   Packet encapsulation and forwarding\
    \ for point-to-multipoint PWs has\n   been discussed within the PWE3 Working Group\
    \ [P2MP-PW-ENCAPS], but\n   such definition is for further study.\n"
- title: 5.  Operations, Administration, and Maintenance
  contents:
  - "5.  Operations, Administration, and Maintenance\n   The requirements for MPLS-TP\
    \ OAM are specified in [RFC5860].  The\n   overall OAM architecture for MPLS-TP\
    \ is defined in [RFC6371], and\n   P2MP OAM design considerations are described\
    \ in Section 3.7 of that\n   RFC.\n   All the traffic sent over a P2MP transport\
    \ path, including OAM\n   packets generated by a MEP, is sent (multicast) from\
    \ the root towards\n   all the leaves, and thus may be processed by all the MIPs\
    \ and MEPs\n   associated with a P2MP MEG.  If an OAM packet is to be processed\
    \ by\n   only a specific leaf, it requires information to indicate to all\n  \
    \ other leaves that the packet must be discarded.  To address a packet\n   to\
    \ an intermediate node in the tree, Time-to-Live-based addressing is\n   used\
    \ to set the radius and additional information in the OAM payload\n   is used\
    \ to identify the specific destination.  It is worth noting\n   that a MIP and\
    \ MEP may be instantiated on a single node when it is\n   both a branch and leaf\
    \ node.\n   P2MP paths are unidirectional; therefore, any return path to an\n\
    \   originating MEP for on-demand transactions will be out of band.  Out-\n  \
    \ of-band return paths are discussed in Section 3.8 of [RFC5921].\n   A more detailed\
    \ discussion of P2MP OAM considerations can be found in\n   [MPLS-TP-P2MP-OAM].\n"
- title: 6.  Control Plane
  contents:
  - "6.  Control Plane\n   The framework for the MPLS-TP control plane is provided\
    \ in [RFC6373].\n   This document reviews MPLS-TP control-plane requirements as\
    \ well as\n   provides details on how the MPLS-TP control plane satisfies these\n\
    \   requirements.  Most of the requirements identified in [RFC6373] apply\n  \
    \ equally to P2P and P2MP transport paths.  The key P2MP-specific\n   control-plane\
    \ requirements are:\n   o  requirement 6 (P2MP transport paths),\n   o  requirement\
    \ 34 (use P2P sub-layers),\n   o  requirement 49 (common recovery solutions for\
    \ P2P and P2MP),\n   o  requirement 59 (1+1 protection),\n   o  requirement 62\
    \ (1:n protection), and\n   o  requirement 65 (1:n shared mesh recovery).\n  \
    \ [RFC6373] defines the control-plane approach used to support MPLS-TP\n   transport\
    \ paths.  It identifies GMPLS as the control plane for MPLS-\n   TP LSPs and tLDP\
    \ as the control plane for PWs.  MPLS-TP allows that\n   either, or both, LSPs\
    \ and PWs to be provisioned statically or via a\n   control plane.  Quoting from\
    \ [RFC6373]:\n      The PW and LSP control planes, collectively, must satisfy\
    \ the\n      MPLS-TP control-plane requirements.  As with P2P services, when\n\
    \      P2MP client services are provided directly via LSPs, all\n      requirements\
    \ must be satisfied by the LSP control plane.  When\n      client services are\
    \ provided via PWs, the PW and LSP control\n      planes can operate in combination,\
    \ and some functions may be\n      satisfied via the PW control plane while others\
    \ are provided to\n      PWs by the LSP control plane.  This is particularly noteworthy\
    \ for\n      P2MP recovery.\n"
- title: 6.1.  P2MP LSP Control Plane
  contents:
  - "6.1.  P2MP LSP Control Plane\n   The MPLS-TP control plane for P2MP LSPs uses\
    \ GMPLS and is based on\n   RSVP-TE for P2MP LSPs as defined in [RFC4875].  A\
    \ detailed listing of\n   how GMPLS satisfies MPLS-TP control-plane requirements\
    \ is provided in\n   [RFC6373].\n   [RFC6373] notes that recovery techniques for\
    \ traffic engineered P2MP\n   LSPs are not formally defined, and that such a definition\
    \ is needed.\n   A formal definition will be based on existing RFCs and may not\n\
    \   require any new protocol mechanisms but, nonetheless, should be\n   documented.\
    \  GMPLS recovery is defined in [RFC4872] and [RFC4873].\n   Protection of P2MP\

    \ be based on the LDP\n   control protocol used for point-to-point PWs [RFC4447],\
    \ with updates\n   as required for P2MP applications.  A detailed specification\
    \ of the\n   control plane for P2MP PWs is for further study.\n"
- title: 7.  Survivability
  contents:
  - "7.  Survivability\n   The overall survivability architecture for MPLS-TP is defined\
    \ in\n   [RFC6372], and Section 4.7.3 of that RFC in particular describes the\n\
    \   application of linear protection to unidirectional P2MP entities\n   using\
    \ 1+1 and 1:1 protection architecture.  For 1+1, the approach is\n   for the root\
    \ of the P2MP tree to bridge the user traffic to both the\n   working and protection\
    \ entities.  Each sink/leaf MPLS-TP node selects\n   the traffic from one entity\
    \ according to some predetermined criteria.\n   For 1:1, the source/root MPLS-TP\
    \ node needs to identify the existence\n   of a fault condition impacting delivery\
    \ to any of the leaves.  Fault\n   notification happens from the node identifying\
    \ the fault to the root\n   node via an out-of-band path.  The root then selects\
    \ the protection\n   transport path for traffic transfer.  More sophisticated\n\
    \   survivability approaches such as partial tree protection and 1:n\n   protection\
    \ are for further study.\n   The IETF has no experience with P2MP PW survivability\
    \ as yet;\n   therefore, it is proposed that the P2MP PW survivability will\n\
    \   initially rely on the LSP survivability.  Further work is needed on\n   this\
    \ subject, particularly if a requirement emerges to provide\n   survivability\
    \ for P2MP PWs in an MPLS-TP context.\n"
