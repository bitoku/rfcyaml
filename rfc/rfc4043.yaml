    \ affiliation of that entity stored in the subject or another name\n   form in\
    \ the subjectAltName extension has changed.\n   The subject name, carried in the\
    \ subject field, is only unique for\n   each subject entity certified by the one\
    \ CA as defined by the issuer\n   name field.  However, the new name form can\

  - "1.  Introduction\n   The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\"\
    , \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and\
    \ \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].\n\
    \   This specification is based on [RFC3280], which defines underlying\n   certificate\
    \ formats and semantics needed for a full implementation of\n   this standard.\n\
    \   The subject field of a public key certificate identifies the entity\n   associated\
    \ with the public key stored in the subject public key\n   field.  Names and identities\
    \ of a subject may be carried in the\n   subject field and/or the subjectAltName\
    \ extension.  Where subject\n   field is non-empty, it MUST contain an X.500 distinguished\
    \ name (DN).\n   The DN MUST be unique for each subject entity certified by a\
    \ single\n   CA as defined by the issuer name field.\n   The subject name changes\
    \ whenever any of the components of that name\n   gets changed.  There are several\
    \ reasons for such a change to happen.\n      For employees of a company or organization,\
    \ the person may get a\n      different position within the same company and thus\
    \ will move from\n      one organization unit to another one.  Including the organization\n\
    \      unit in the name may however be very useful to allow the relying\n    \
    \  parties (RP's) using that certificate to identify the right\n      individual.\n\
    \      For citizens, an individual may change their name by legal\n      processes,\
    \ especially as a result of marriage.\n      Any certificate subject identified\
    \ by geographical location may\n      relocate and change at least some of the\
    \ location attributes\n      (e.g., country name, state or province, locality,\
    \ or street).\n   A permanent identifier consists of an identifier value assigned\n\
    \   within a given naming space by the organization which is\n   authoritative\
    \ for that naming space.  The organization assigning the\n   identifier value\
    \ may be the CA that has issued the certificate or a\n   different organization\
    \ called an Assigner Authority.\n   An Assigner Authority may be a government,\
    \ a government agency, a\n   corporation, or any other sort of organization. \
    \ It MUST have a\n   unique identifier to distinguish it from any other such authority.\n\
    \   In this standard, that identifier MUST be an object identifier.\n   A permanent\
    \ identifier may be useful in three contexts: access\n   control, non-repudiation\
    \ and audit records.\n      For access control, the permanent identifier may be\
    \ used in an ACL\n      (Access Control List) instead of the DN or any other form\
    \ of name\n      and would not need to be changed, even if the subject name of\
    \ the\n      entity changes.  For non-repudiation, the permanent identifier may\n\
    \      be used to link different transactions to the same entity, even\n     \
    \ when the subject name of the entity changes.\n      For audit records, the permanent\
    \ identifier may be used to link\n      different audit records to the same entity,\
    \ even when the subject\n      name of the entity changes.\n   For two certificates\
    \ which have been both verified to be valid\n   according to a given validation\
    \ policy and which contain a permanent\n   identifier, those certificates relate\
    \ to the same entity if their\n   permanent identifiers match, whatever the content\
    \ of the DN or other\n   subjectAltName components may be.\n   Since the use of\
    \ permanent identifiers may conflict with privacy, CAs\n   SHOULD advertise to\
    \ purchasers of certificates the use of permanent\n   identifiers in certificates.\n"
- title: 2.  Definition of a Permanent Identifier
  contents:
  - "2.  Definition of a Permanent Identifier\n   This Permanent Identifier is a name\
    \ defined as a form of otherName\n   from the GeneralName structure in SubjectAltName,\
    \ as defined in\n   [X.509] and [RFC3280].\n   A CA which includes a permanent\
    \ identifier in a certificate is\n   certifying that any public key certificate\
    \ containing the same values\n   for that identifier refers to the same entity.\n\
    \   The use of a permanent identifier is OPTIONAL.  The permanent\n   identifier\
    \ is defined as follows:\n      id-on-permanentIdentifier   OBJECT IDENTIFIER\
    \ ::= { id-on 3 }\n        PermanentIdentifier ::=     SEQUENCE {\n          \
    \ identifierValue    UTF8String             OPTIONAL,\n                      \
    \     -- if absent, use a serialNumber attribute,\n                          \
    \ -- if there is such an attribute present\n                           -- in the\
    \ subject DN\n           assigner           OBJECT IDENTIFIER      OPTIONAL\n\
    \                           -- if absent, the assigner is\n                  \
    \         -- the certificate issuer\n   }\n   The identifierValue field is optional.\n\
    \      When the identifierValue field is present, then the\n      identifierValue\
    \ supports one syntax: UTF8String.\n      When the identifierValue field is absent,\
    \ then the value of the\n      serialNumber attribute (as defined in section 5.2.9\
    \ of [X.520])\n      from the deepest RDN of the subject DN is the value to be\
    \ taken\n      for the identifierValue.  In such a case, there MUST be at least\n\
    \      one serialNumber attribute in the subject DN, otherwise the\n      PermanentIdentifier\
    \ SHALL NOT be used.\n   The assigner field is optional.\n      When the assigner\
    \ field is present, then it is an OID which\n      identifies a naming space,\
    \ i.e., both an Assigner Authority and\n      the type of that field.  Characteristically,\
    \ the prefix of the OID\n      identifies the Assigner Authority, and a suffix\
    \ is used to\n      identify the type of permanent identifier.\n      When the\
    \ assigner field is absent, then the permanent identifier\n      is locally unique\
    \ to the CA.\n   The various combinations are detailed below:\n   1. Both the\
    \ assigner and the identifierValue fields are present:\n      The identifierValue\
    \ is the value for that type of identifier.  The\n      assigner field identifies\
    \ the Assigner Authority and the type of\n      permanent identifier being identified.\n\
    \      The permanent identifier is globally unique among all CAs.  In\n      such\
    \ a case, two permanent identifiers of this type match if and\n      only if their\
    \ assigner fields match and the contents of the\n      identifierValue field in\
    \ the two permanent identifiers consist of\n      the same Unicode code points\
    \ presented in the same order.\n   2. The assigner field is absent and the identifierValue\
    \ field is\n      present:\n      The Assigner Authority is the CA that has issued\
    \ the certificate.\n      The identifierValue is given by the CA and the permanent\n\
    \      identifier is only local to the CA that has issued the\n      certificate.\n\
    \      In such a case, two permanent identifiers of this type match if\n     \
    \ and only if the issuer DN's in the certificates which contain them\n      match\
    \ using the distinguishedNameMatch rule, as defined in X.501,\n      and the two\
    \ values of the identifierValue field consist of the\n      same Unicode code\
    \ points presented in the same order.\n   3. Both the assigner and the identifierValue\
    \ fields are absent:\n      If there are one or more RDNs containing a serialNumber\
    \ attribute\n      (alone or accompanied by other attributes), then the value\n\
    \      contained in the serialNumber of the deepest such RDN SHALL be\n      used\
    \ as the identifierValue; otherwise, the Permanent Identifier\n      definition\
    \ is invalid and the Permanent Identifier SHALL NOT be\n      used.\n      The\
    \ permanent identifier is only local to the CA that has issued\n      the certificate.\
    \  In such a case, two permanent identifiers of\n      this type match if and\
    \ only if the issuer DN's in the certificates\n      which contain them match\
    \ and the serialNumber attributes within\n      the subject DN's of those same\
    \ certificates also match using the\n      caseIgnoreMatch rule.\n   4. The assigner\
    \ field is present and the identifierValue field is\n      absent:\n      If there\
    \ are one or more RDNs containing a serialNumber attribute\n      (alone or accompanied\
    \ by other attributes), then the value\n      contained in the serialNumber of\
    \ the deepest such RDN SHALL be\n      used as the identifierValue; otherwise,\
    \ the Permanent Identifier\n      definition is invalid and the Permanent Identifier\
    \ SHALL NOT be\n      used.\n      The assigner field identifies the Assigner\
    \ Authority and the type\n      of permanent identifier being identified.\n  \
    \    The permanent identifier is globally unique among all CAs.  In\n      such\
    \ a case, two permanent identifiers of this type match if and\n      only if their\
    \ assigner fields match and the contents of the\n      serialNumber attributes\
    \ within the subject DN's of those same\n      certificates match using the caseIgnoreMatch\
    \ rule.\n   Note: The full arc of the object identifier used to identify the\n\
    \         permanent identifier name form is derived using:\n      id-pkix OBJECT\
    \ IDENTIFIER ::= { iso(1) identified-organization(3)\n         dod(6) internet(1)\
    \ security(5) mechanisms(5) pkix(7) }\n      id-on OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { id-pkix\
    \ 8 }   -- other name forms\n"

  - "3.  IANA Considerations\n   No IANA actions are necessary.  However, a Private\

    \ (see Annex\n   B.1.).\n"
- title: 4.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "4.  Security Considerations\n   A given entity may have at an instant of time\
    \ or at different\n   instants of time multiple forms of identities.  If the permanent\n\
    \   identifier is locally unique to the CA (i.e., the assigner field is\n   not\
    \ present), then two certificates from the same CA can be compared.\n   When two\
    \ certificates contain identical permanent identifiers, then a\n   relying party\
    \ may determine that they refer to the same entity.\n   If the permanent identifier\
    \ is globally unique among all CAs (i.e.,\n   the assigner field is present),\
    \ then two certificates from different\n   CAs can be compared.  When they contain\
    \ two identical permanent\n   identifiers, then a relying party may determine\
    \ that they refer to\n   the same entity.  It is the responsibility of the CA\
    \ to verify that\n   the permanent identifier being included in the certificate\
    \ refers to\n   the subject being certified.\n   The permanent identifier identifies\
    \ the entity, irrespective of any\n   attribute extension.  When a public key\
    \ certificate contains\n   attribute extensions, the permanent identifier, if\
    \ present, should\n   not be used for access control purposes but only for audit\
    \ purposes.\n   The reason is that since these attributes may change, access could\
    \ be\n   granted on attributes that were originally present in a certificate\n\
    \   issued to that entity but are no longer present in the current\n   certificate.\n\
    \   Subject names in certificates are chosen by the issuing CA and are\n   mandated\
    \ to be unique for each CA; so there can be no name collision\n   between subject\
    \ names from the same CA.  Such a name may be an end-\n   entity name when the\
    \ certificate is a leaf certificate, or a CA name,\n   when it is a CA certificate.\n\
    \   Since a name is only unique towards its superior CA, unless some\n   naming\
    \ constraints are being used, a name would only be guaranteed to\n   be globally\
    \ unique when considered to include a sequence of all the\n   names of the superior\
    \ CAs.  Thus, two certificates that are issued\n   under the same issuer DN and\
    \ which contain the same permanent\n   identifier extension without an assigner\
    \ field do not necessarily\n   refer to the same entity.\n   Additional checks\
    \ need to be done, e.g., to check if the public key\n   values of the two CAs\
    \ which have issued the certificates to be\n   compared are identical or if the\
    \ sequence of CA names in the\n   certification path from the trust anchor to\
    \ the CA are identical.\n   When the above checks fail, the permanent identifiers\
    \ may still match\n   if there has been a CA key rollover.  In such a case the\
    \ checking is\n   more complicated.\n   The certification of different CAs with\
    \ the same DN by different CAs\n   has other negative consequences in various\
    \ parts of the PKI, notably\n   rendering the IssuerAndSerialNumber structure\
    \ in [RFC3852] section\n   10.2.4 ambiguous.\n   The permanent identifier allows\
    \ organizations to create links between\n   different certificates associated\
    \ with an entity issued with or\n   without overlapping validity periods.  This\
    \ ability to link different\n   certificates may conflict with privacy.  It is\
    \ therefore important\n   that a CA clearly disclose any plans to issue certificates\
    \ which\n   include a permanent identifier to potential subjects of those\n  \
    \ certificates.\n"

  - "Appendix B.  OID's for Organizations\n   In order to construct an OID for the\
    \ assigner field, organizations\n   need first to have a registered OID for themselves.\
    \  Such an OID must\n   be obtained from a registration authority following [X.660].\
    \  In some\n   cases, OID's are provided for free.  In other cases a one-time\
    \ fee is\n   required.  The main difference lies in the nature of the information\n\
    \   that is collected at the time of registration and how this\n   information\
    \ is verified for its accuracy.\n"

- title: Appendix B.2.  Using an ISO Member Body
  contents:
  - "Appendix B.2.  Using an ISO Member Body\n   ISO has defined the OID structure\
    \ in a such a way so that every ISO\n   member-body has its own unique OID.  Then\
    \ every ISO member-body is\n   free to allocate its own arc space below.\n   Organizations\
    \ and enterprises may contact the ISO member-body where\n   their organization\
    \ or enterprise is established to obtain an\n   organization/enterprise OID.\n\
    \   Currently, ISO members do not assign organization/enterprise OID's\n   for\
    \ free.\n   Most of them do not publish registries of such OID's which they have\n\
    \   assigned, sometimes restricting the access to registered\n   organizations\
    \ or preferring to charge inquirers for the assignee of\n   an OID on a per-inquiry\
    \ basis.  The use of OID's from an ISO member\n   organization which does not\
    \ publish such a registry may impose extra\n   costs on the CA that needs to make\
    \ sure that the OID corresponds to\n   the registered organization.\n   As an\
    \ example, AFNOR (Association Francaise de Normalisation - the\n   French organization\
    \ that is a member of ISO) has defined an arc to\n   allocate OID's for companies:\n\
    \   {iso (1) member-body (2) fr (250) type-org (1) organisation (n)}\n"
- title: Appendix B.3.  Using an ICD (International Code Designator) From British

  - "Appendix B.3.  Using an ICD (International Code Designator) From British\n  \
    \             Standards Institution to Specify a New or an Existing\n        \
    \       Identification Scheme\n   The International Code Designator (ICD) is used\
    \ to uniquely identify\n   an ISO 6523 compliant organization identification scheme.\
    \  ISO 6523\n   is a standard that defines the proper structure of an identifier\
    \ and\n   the registration procedure for an ICD.  The conjunction of the ICD\n\
    \   with an identifier issued by the registration authority is worldwide\n   unique.\n\
    \   The basic structure of the code contains the following components:\n   - \
    \ the ICD value: The International Code Designator issued to the\n      identification\
    \ scheme makes the identifier worldwide unique (up to\n      4 digits),\n   -\
    \  the Organization, usually a company or governmental body (up to 35\n      characters),\n\
    \   -  an Organization Part (OPI - Organization Part Identifier).  An\n      identifier\
    \ allocated to a particular Organization Part (optional,\n      up to 35 characters)\n\
    \   The ICD is also equivalent to an object identifier (OID) under the\n   arc\
    \ {1(iso).  3(identified organization)}.\n   On behalf of ISO, British Standards\
    \ Institution (BSI) is the\n   Registration Authority for organizations under\
    \ the arc {iso (1)\n   org(3)}.  This means BSI registers code issuing authorities\n\
    \   (organizations) by ICD values which are equivalent to OIDs of the\n   form\
    \ {iso (1) org(3) icd(xxxx)}.  The corresponding IdentifierValue\n   is the code\
    \ value of the scheme identified by icd(xxxx).\n   As an example, the ICD 0012\
    \ was allocated to European Computer\n   Manufacturers Association: ECMA.  Thus\
    \ the OID for ECMA is {iso(1)\n   org(3) ecma(12)}.\n   For registration with\
    \ BSI, a \"Sponsoring Authority\" has to vouch for\n   the Applying organization.\
    \  Registration is not free.  Recognized\n   \"Sponsoring Authorities\" are: ISO\
    \ Technical Committees or\n   (Sub)Committees, Member Bodies of ISO or International\
    \ Organizations\n   having a liaison status with ISO or with any of its Technical\n\
    \   (Sub)Committees.\n   An example of a Sponsoring Authority is the EDIRA Association\
    \ (EDI/EC\n   Registration Authority, web: http://www.edira.org,\n   email:info@edira.org).\n\
    \   The numerical list of all ICDs that have been issued is posted on its\n  \
    \ webpage: http://www.edira.org/documents.htm#icd-List\n   Note: IANA owns ICD\
    \ code 0090, but (presumably) it isn't intending to\n   use it for the present\
    \ purpose.\n"
