  - "Abstract\n   One of the main motivations behind Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS)\n\
    \   is its ability to provide connectivity not only among customer\n   routers\
    \ and servers/hosts but also among customer IEEE bridges.  VPLS\n   is expected\
    \ to deliver the same level of service that current\n   enterprise users are accustomed\
    \ to from their own enterprise bridged\n   networks or their Ethernet Service\
    \ Providers.\n   When customer edge (CE) devices are IEEE bridges, then there\
    \ are\n   certain issues and challenges that need to be accounted for in a VPLS\n\
    \   network.  The majority of these issues have been addressed in the\n   IEEE\
    \ 802.1ad standard for provider bridges and they can be leveraged\n   for VPLS\
    \ networks.  This document extends the provider edge (PE)\n   model described\
    \ in RFC 4664 based on IEEE 802.1ad bridge module, and\n   it illustrates a clear\
    \ demarcation between the IEEE bridge module and\n   IETF LAN emulation module.\
    \  By doing so, it shows that the majority\n   of interoperability issues with\
    \ CE bridges can be delegated to the\n   802.1ad bridge module, thus removing\
    \ the burden on the IETF LAN\n   emulation module within a VPLS PE.\n"

  - "1.  Introduction\n   Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS) is a LAN emulation service\n\
    \   intended for providing connectivity between geographically dispersed\n   customer\
    \ sites across MANs/WANs (over MPLS/IP), as if they were\n   connected using a\
    \ LAN.  One of the main motivations behind VPLS is\n   its ability to provide\
    \ connectivity not only among customer routers\n   and servers/hosts but also\
    \ among IEEE customer bridges.  If only\n   connectivity among customer IP routers/hosts\
    \ is desired, then an IP-\n   only LAN Service [IPLS] solution could be used.\
    \  The strength of the\n   VPLS solution is that it can provide connectivity to\
    \ both bridge and\n   non-bridge types of CE devices.  VPLS is expected to deliver\
    \ the same\n   level of service that current enterprise users are accustomed to\
    \ from\n   their own enterprise bridged networks [802.1D] [802.1Q] today or the\n\
    \   same level of service that they receive from their Ethernet Service\n   Providers\
    \ using IEEE 802.1ad-based networks [802.1ad] (or its\n   predecessor, QinQ-based\
    \ networks).\n   When CE devices are IEEE bridges, then there are certain issues\
    \ and\n   challenges that need to be accounted for in a VPLS network.  The\n \
    \  majority of these issues have been addressed in the IEEE 802.1ad\n   standard\
    \ for provider bridges and they can be leveraged for VPLS\n   networks.  This\
    \ document extends the PE model described in [RFC4664]\n   based on the IEEE 802.1ad\
    \ bridge module and illustrates a clear\n   demarcation between IEEE bridge module\
    \ and IETF LAN emulation module.\n   By doing so, it describes that the majority\
    \ of interoperability\n   issues with CE bridges can be delegated to the 802.1ad\
    \ bridge module,\n   thus removing the burden on the IETF LAN emulation module\
    \ within a\n   VPLS PE.  This document discusses these issues and, wherever\n\
    \   possible, suggests areas to be explored in rectifying these issues.\n   The\
    \ detailed solution specification for these issues is outside of\n   the scope\
    \ of this document.\n   This document also discusses interoperability issues between\
    \ VPLS and\n   IEEE 802.1ad networks when the end-to-end service spans across\
    \ both\n   types of networks, as outlined in [RFC4762].\n   This document categorizes\
    \ the CE-bridge issues into two groups: 1)\n   mandatory and 2) optional.  The\
    \ issues in group (1) need to be\n   addressed in order to ensure the proper operation\
    \ of CE bridges.  The\n   issues in group (2) would provide additional operational\
    \ improvement\n   and efficiency and may not be required for interoperability\
    \ with CE\n   bridges.  Sections 5 and 6 discuss these mandatory and optional\n\
    \   issues, respectively.\n"

- title: 2.  Ethernet Service Instance
  contents:
  - "2.  Ethernet Service Instance\n   Before starting the discussion of bridging\
    \ issues, it is important to\n   clarify the Ethernet Service definition.  The\
    \ term VPLS has different\n   meanings in different contexts.  In general, VPLS\
    \ is used in the\n   following contexts [RFC6136]: a) as an end-to-end bridged\
    \ LAN service\n   over one or more networks (one of which is an MPLS/IP network),\
    \ b) as\n   an MPLS/IP network supporting these bridged LAN services, and c) as\n\
    \   (V)LAN emulation.  For better clarity, we differentiate between its\n   usage\
    \ as network versus service by using the terms VPLS network and\n   VPLS instance,\
    \ respectively.  Furthermore, we confine VPLS (both\n   network and service) to\
    \ only the portion of the end-to-end network\n   that spans an MPLS/IP network.\
    \  For an end-to-end service (among\n   different sites of a given customer),\
    \ we use the term \"Ethernet\n   Service Instance\" or ESI.\n   We define the\
    \ Ethernet Service Instance (ESI) as an association of\n   two or more Attachment\
    \ Circuits (ACs) over which an Ethernet service\n   is offered to a given customer.\
    \  An AC can be either a User-Network\n   Interface (UNI) or a Network-Network\
    \ Interface (NNI); furthermore, it\n   can be an Ethernet interface or a VLAN,\
    \ it can be an ATM or Frame\n   Relay Virtual Circuit, or it can be a PPP/HDLC\
    \ (PPP/High-Level Data\n   Link Control) interface.  If an ESI is associated with\
    \ more than two\n   ACs, then it is a multipoint ESI.  In this document, wherever\
    \ the\n   keyword ESI is used, it means multipoint ESI unless stated otherwise.\n\
    \   An ESI can correspond to a VPLS instance if its associated ACs are\n   only\
    \ connected to a VPLS network, or an ESI can correspond to a\n   Service VLAN\
    \ if its associated ACs are only connected to a Provider-\n   Bridged network\
    \ [802.1ad].  Furthermore, an ESI can be associated\n   with both a VPLS instance\
    \ and a Service VLAN when considering an end-\n   to-end service that spans across\
    \ both VPLS and Provider-Bridged\n   networks.  An ESI can span across different\
    \ networks (e.g., IEEE\n   802.1ad and VPLS) belonging to the same or different\
    \ administrative\n   domains.\n   An ESI most often represents a customer or a\
    \ specific service\n   requested by a customer.  Since traffic isolation among\
    \ different\n   customers (or their associated services) is of paramount importance\n\
    \   in service provider networks, its realization shall be done such that\n  \
    \ it provides a separate Media Access Control (MAC) address domain and\n   broadcast\
    \ domain per ESI.  A separate MAC address domain is provided\n   by using a separate\
    \ MAC forwarding table (e.g., Forwarding\n   Information Base (FIB), also known\
    \ as filtering database [802.1D])\n   per ESI (for both VPLS and IEEE 802.1ad\
    \ networks).  A separate\n   broadcast domain is provided by using a full mesh\
    \ of pseudowires per\n   ESI over the IP/MPLS core in a VPLS network and/or a\
    \ dedicated\n   Service VLAN per ESI in an IEEE 802.1ad network.\n"
- title: 3.  VPLS-Capable PE Model with Bridge Module
  contents:
  - "3.  VPLS-Capable PE Model with Bridge Module\n   [RFC4664] defines three models\
    \ for VPLS-capable PE (VPLS-PE), based\n   on the bridging functionality that\
    \ needs to be supported by the PE.\n   If the CE devices can be routers/hosts\
    \ or IEEE bridges, the second\n   model from [RFC4664] is the most suitable, and\
    \ it is both adequate to\n   provide the VPLS level of service and consistent\
    \ with the IEEE\n   standards for Provider Bridges [802.1ad].  We briefly describe\
    \ the\n   second model and then expand upon this model to show its sub-\n   components\
    \ based on the [802.1ad] Provider Bridge model.\n   As described in [RFC4664],\
    \ the second model for VPLS-PE contains a\n   single bridge module supporting\
    \ all the VPLS instances on that PE ,\n   where each VPLS instance is represented\
    \ by a unique VLAN inside that\n   bridge module (also known as a Service VLAN\
    \ or S-VLAN).  The bridge\n   module has a single \"Emulated LAN\" interface over\
    \ which it\n   communicates with all VPLS forwarders, and each VPLS instance is\n\
    \   represented by a unique S-VLAN tag.  Each VPLS instance can consist\n   of\
    \ a set of pseudowires, and its associated forwarder can correspond\n   to a single\
    \ VLAN as depicted in Figure 1 below.  Thus, sometimes it\n   is referred to as\

    \ and it is responsible\n   for tagging customer frames with S-VLAN tags in the\
    \ ingress direction\n   (from customer UNIs) and removing S-VLAN tags in the egress\
    \ direction\n   (toward customer UNIs).  It is also responsible for running the\n\
    \   provider's bridge protocol -- such as Rapid Spanning Tree Protocol\n   (RSTP),\
    \ Multiple Spanning Tree Protocol (MSTP), Generic VLAN\n   Registration Protocol\
    \ (GVRP), GARP Multicast Registration Protocol\n   (GMRP), etc. -- among provider\
    \ bridges within a single administrative\n   domain.\n   The customer VLAN (C-VLAN)\
    \ bridge component is required when the\n   customer Attachment Circuits are VLANs\
    \ (aka C-VLANs).  In such cases,\n   the VPLS-capable PE needs to participate\
    \ in some of the customer's\n   bridging protocol such as RSTP and MSTP.  Such\
    \ participation is\n   required because a C-VLAN at one site can be mapped into\
    \ a different\n   C-VLAN at a different site or, in case of asymmetric mapping,\
    \ a\n   customer Ethernet port at one site can be mapped into a C-VLAN (or\n \
    \  group of C-VLANs) at a different site.\n   The C-VLAN bridge component does\
    \ service selection and identification\n   based on C-VLAN tags.  Each frame from\
    \ the customer device is\n   assigned to a C-VLAN and presented at one or more\
    \ internal port-based\n   interfaces, each supporting a single service instance\
    \ that the\n   customer desires to carry that C-VLAN.  Similarly, frames from\
    \ the\n   provider network are assigned to an internal interface or 'LAN' (e.g,\n\
    \   between C-VLAN and S-VLAN components) on the basis of the S-VLAN tag.\n  \
    \ Since each internal interface supports a single service instance, the\n   S-VLAN\
    \ tag can be, and is, removed at this interface by the S-VLAN\n   bridge component.\
    \  If multiple C-VLANs are supported by this service\n   instance (e.g., via VLAN\
    \ bundling or port-based service), then the\n   frames will have already been\
    \ tagged with C-VLAN tags.  If a single\n   C-VLAN is supported by this service\
    \ instance (e.g., VLAN-based), then\n   the frames will not have been tagged with\
    \ a C-VLAN tag since C-VLAN\n   can be derived from the S-VLAN (e.g., one-to-one\
    \ mapping).  The\n   C-VLAN-aware bridge component applies a port VLAN ID (PVID)\
    \ to\n   untagged frames received on each internal 'LAN', allowing full\n   control\
    \ over the delivery of frames for each C-VLAN through the\n   Customer UNI Port.\n"

  contents:
  - "4.1.  Service Mapping\n   Different Ethernet AC types can be associated with\
    \ a single Ethernet\n   Service Instance (ESI).  For example, an ESI can be associated\
    \ with\n   only physical Ethernet ports, VLANs, or a combination of the two\n\
    \   (e.g., one end of the service could be associated with physical\n   Ethernet\
    \ ports and the other end could be associated with VLANs).  In\n   [RFC4762],\
    \ unqualified and qualified learning are used to refer to\n   port-based and VLAN-based\
    \ operation, respectively.  [RFC4762] does\n   not describe the possible mappings\
    \ between different types of\n   Ethernet ACs (e.g., 802.1D, 802.1Q, or 802.1ad\
    \ frames).  In general,\n   the mapping of a customer port or VLAN to a given\
    \ service instance is\n   a local function performed by the local PE, and the\
    \ service\n   provisioning shall accommodate it.  In other words, there is no\n\
    \   reason to restrict and limit an ESI to have only port-based ACs or to\n  \
    \ have only VLAN-based ACs.  [802.1ad] allows for each customer AC\n   (either\
    \ a physical port, a VLAN, or a group of VLANs) to be mapped\n   independently\
    \ to an ESI that provides better service offerings to\n   enterprise customers.\
    \  For better and more flexible service offerings\n   and for interoperability\
    \ purposes between VPLS and 802.1ad networks,\n   it is imperative that both networks\
    \ offer the same capabilities in\n   terms of customer ACs mapping to the customer\
    \ service instance.\n   The following table lists possible mappings that can exist\
    \ between\n   customer ACs and their associated ESIs.  As can be seen, there are\n\
    \   several possible ways to perform such mappings.  In the first\n   scenario,\
    \ it is assumed that an Ethernet physical port only carries\n   untagged traffic\
    \ and all traffic is mapped to the corresponding\n   service instance or ESI.\
    \  This is referred to as \"port-based with\n   untagged traffic\".  In the second\
    \ scenario, it is assumed that an\n   Ethernet physical port carries both tagged\
    \ and untagged traffic and\n   all that traffic is mapped to the corresponding\
    \ service instance or\n   ESI.  This is referred to as \"port-based with tagged\
    \ and untagged\n   traffic\".  In the third scenario, it is assumed that only\
    \ a single\n   VLAN is mapped to the corresponding service instance or ESI.  This\
    \ is\n   referred to as \"VLAN-based\".  Finally, in the fourth scenario, it is\n\
    \   assumed that a group of VLANs from the Ethernet physical interface is\n  \
    \ mapped to the corresponding service instance or ESI.  This is\n   referred to\
    \ as \"VLAN bundling\".\n   ===================================================================\n\

  - "4.2.  CE Bridge Protocol Handling\n   When a VPLS-capable PE is connected to\
    \ a CE bridge, then -- depending\n   on the type of Attachment Circuit -- different\
    \ protocol handling may\n   be required by the bridge module of the PE.  [802.1ad]\
    \ states that\n   when a PE is connected to a CE bridge, then the service offered\
    \ by\n   the PE may appear to specific customer protocols running on the CE in\n\
    \   one of the four ways:\n      a) Transparent to the operation of the protocol\
    \ among CEs of\n         different sites using the service provided, appearing\
    \ as an\n         individual LAN without bridges;\n      b) Discarding frames,\
    \ acting as a non-participating barrier to the\n         operation of the protocol;\n\
    \      c) Peering, with a local protocol entity at the point of provider\n   \
    \      ingress and egress, participating in and terminating the\n         operation\
    \ of the protocol; or\n      d) Participation in individual instances of customer\
    \ protocols.\n   All the above CE bridge protocol handling can be supported via\
    \ the PE\n   model with the bridge module depicted in Figure 2 (based on\n   [802.1ad]).\
    \  For example, when an Attachment Circuit is port-based,\n   then the bridge\
    \ module of the PE can operate transparently with\n   respect to the CE's RSTPs\
    \ or MSTPs (and thus no C-VLAN component is\n   required for that customer UNI).\
    \  However, when an Attachment Circuit\n   is VLAN-based (either VLAN-based or\
    \ VLAN bundling), then the bridge\n   module of the PE needs to peer with the\
    \ RSTPs or MSTPs running on the\n   CE (and thus the C-VLAN bridge component is\
    \ required).  In other\n   words, when the AC is VLAN-based, then protocol peering\
    \ between CE\n   and PE devices may be needed.  There are also protocols that\
    \ require\n   peering but are independent from the type of Attachment Circuit.\
    \  An\n   example of such protocol is the link aggregation protocol [802.1AX];\n\
    \   however, this is a media-dependent protocol as its name implies.\n   [802.1ad]\
    \ reserves a block of 16 MAC addresses for the operation of\n   C-VLAN and S-VLAN\
    \ bridge components.  Also, it shows which of these\n   reserved MAC addresses\
    \ are only for C-VLAN bridge components, which\n   are only for S-VLAN bridge\
    \ components, and which apply to both C-VLAN\n   and S-VLAN components.\n"
- title: 4.3.  Partial Mesh of Pseudowires
  contents:
  - "4.3.  Partial Mesh of Pseudowires\n   A VPLS service depends on a full mesh of\
    \ pseudowires, so a pseudowire\n   failure reduces the underlying connectivity\
    \ to a partial mesh, which\n   can have adverse effects on the VPLS service. \
    \ If the CE devices\n   belonging to an ESI are routers running link state routing\
    \ protocols\n   that use LAN procedures over that ESI, then a partial mesh of\
    \ PWs can\n   result in \"black holing\" traffic among the selected set of routers.\n\
    \   And if the CE devices belonging to an ESI are IEEE bridges, then a\n   partial\
    \ mesh of PWs can cause broadcast storms in the customer and\n   provider networks.\
    \  Furthermore, it can cause multiple copies of a\n   single frame to be received\
    \ by the CE and/or PE devices.  Therefore,\n   it is of paramount importance to\
    \ be able to detect PW failure and to\n   take corrective action to prevent creation\
    \ of partial mesh of PWs.\n   When the PE model depicted in Figure 2 is used,\
    \ then [802.1ag]\n   procedures could be used for detection of partial mesh of\
    \ PWs.\n   [802.1ag] defines a set of procedures for fault detection,\n   verification,\
    \ isolation, and notification per ESI.\n   The fault detection mechanism of [802.1ag]\
    \ can be used to perform\n   connectivity check among PEs belonging to a given\
    \ VPLS instance.  It\n   checks the integrity of a service instance end-to-end\
    \ within an\n   administrative domain, e.g., from one AC at one end of the network\
    \ to\n   another AC at the other end of the network.  Therefore, its path\n  \
    \ coverage includes the bridge module within a PE and it is not limited\n   to\
    \ just PWs.  Furthermore, [802.1ag] operates transparently over the\n   full mesh\
    \ of PWs for a given service instance since it operates at\n   the Ethernet level\
    \ (and not at the PW level).  It should be noted\n   that since a PW consists\
    \ of two unidirectional Label Switched Paths\n   (LSPs), then one direction can\
    \ fail independently of the other.  Even\n   in this case, the procedures of [802.1ag]\
    \ can provide a consistent\n   view of the full mesh to the participating PEs\
    \ by relying on remote\n   defect indication (RDI).\n   Another, less preferred,\
    \ option is to define a procedure for\n   detection of partial mesh; in this procedure,\
    \ each PE keeps track of\n   the status of its PW Endpoint Entities (EEs, e.g.,\
    \ VPLS forwarders)\n   as well as the EEs reported by other PEs.  Therefore, upon\
    \ a PW\n   failure, the PE that detects the failure not only takes notice\n  \
    \ locally but also notifies other PEs belonging to that service\n   instance so\
    \ that all the participant PEs have a consistent view of\n   the PW mesh.  Such\
    \ a procedure is for the detection of partial mesh\n   per service instance, and\
    \ in turn it relies on additional procedure\n   for PW failure detection such\
    \ as Bidirectional Forward Detection\n   (BFD) or Virtual Circuit Connectivity\
    \ Verification (VCCV).  Given\n   that there can be tens (or even hundreds) of\
    \ thousands of PWs in a\n   PE, there can be scalability issues with such fault\n\
    \   detection/notification procedures.\n"
- title: 4.4.  Multicast Traffic
  contents:
  - "4.4.  Multicast Traffic\n   VPLS follows a centralized model for multicast replication\
    \ within an\n   ESI.  VPLS relies on ingress replication.  The ingress PE replicates\n\
    \   the multicast packet for each egress PE and sends it to the egress PE\n  \
    \ using point-to-point PW over a unicast tunnel.  VPLS operates on an\n   overlay\
    \ topology formed by the full mesh of pseudo-wires.  Thus,\n   depending on the\
    \ underlying topology, the same datagram can be sent\n   multiple times down the\
    \ same physical link.  VPLS currently does not\n   offer any mechanisms to restrict\
    \ the distribution of multicast or\n   broadcast traffic of an ESI throughout\
    \ the network, which causes an\n   additional burden on the ingress PE through\
    \ unnecessary packet\n   replication.  This in turn causes additional load on\
    \ the MPLS core\n   network and additional processing at the receiving PE where\n\
    \   extraneous multicast packets are discarded.\n   One possible approach to delivering\
    \ multicast more efficiently over a\n   VPLS network is to include the use of\
    \ IGMP snooping in order to send\n   the packet only to the PEs that have receivers\
    \ for that traffic,\n   rather than to all the PEs in the VPLS instance.  If the\
    \ customer\n   bridge or its network has dual-home connectivity, then -- for proper\n\
    \   operation of IGMP snooping -- the PE must generate a \"General Query\"\n \
    \  over that customer's UNIs upon receiving a customer topology change\n   notification\
    \ as described in [RFC4541].  A \"General Query\" by the PE\n   results the customer\
    \ multicast MAC address(es) being properly\n   registered at the PE when there\
    \ are customer topology changes.  It\n   should be noted that IGMP snooping provides\
    \ a solution for IP\n   multicast packets and is not applicable to general multicast\
    \ data.\n   Using the IGMP snooping as described, the ingress PE can select a\n\
    \   subset of PWs for packet replication, thus avoiding sending multicast\n  \
    \ packets to the egress PEs that don't need them.  However, the\n   replication\
    \ is still performed by the ingress PE.  In order to avoid\n   replication at\
    \ the ingress PE, one may want to use multicast\n   distribution trees (MDTs)\
    \ in the provider core network; however, this\n   brings some potential pitfalls.\
    \  If the MDT is used for all multicast\n   traffic of a given customer, then\
    \ this results in customer multicast\n   and unicast traffic being forwarded on\
    \ different PWs and even on a\n   different physical topology within the provider\
    \ network.  This is a\n   serious issue for customer bridges because customer\
    \ Bridge Protocol\n   Data Units (BPDUs), which are multicast data, can take a\
    \ different\n   path through the network than the unicast data.  Situations might\n\
    \   arise where either unicast OR multicast connectivity is lost.  If\n   unicast\
    \ connectivity is lost but multicast forwarding continues to\n   work, the customer\
    \ spanning tree would not take notice which results\n   in loss of its unicast\
    \ traffic.  Similarly, if multicast connectivity\n   is lost, but unicast is working,\
    \ then the customer spanning tree will\n   activate the blocked port, which may\
    \ result in a loop within the\n   customer network.  Therefore, the MDT cannot\
    \ be used for both\n   customer multicast control and data traffic.  If it is\
    \ used, it\n   should only be limited to customer data traffic.  However, there\
    \ can\n   be a potential issue even when it is used for customer data traffic\n\
    \   since the MDT doesn't fit the PE model described in Figure 1 (it\n   operates\
    \ independently from the full mesh of PWs that correspond to\n   an S-VLAN). \
    \ It is also not clear how connectivity fault management\n   (CFM) procedures\
    \ (802.1ag) used for the ESI integrity check (e.g.,\n   per service instance)\
    \ can be applied to check the integrity of the\n   customer multicast traffic\
    \ over the provider MDT.  Because of these\n   potential issues, the specific\
    \ applications of the provider MDT to\n   customer multicast traffic shall be\
    \ documented and its limitations be\n   clearly specified.\n"

    \                      Figure 4.  Bridge Module Model\n   Figure 4 shows two provider\
    \ access networks each with two PEs that\n   are connected via a full mesh of\
    \ PWs for a given VPLS instance.  As\n   shown in the figure, only one PE in each\
    \ access network serves as a\n   Primary PE (P) for that VPLS instance and the\
    \ other PE serves as the\n   backup PE (B).  In this figure, each primary PE has\
    \ two active PWs\n   originating from it.  Therefore, when a multicast, broadcast,\
    \ and\n   unknown unicast frame arrives at the primary PE from the access\n  \
    \ network side, the PE replicates the frame over both PWs in the core\n   even\
    \ though it only needs to send the frame over a single PW (shown\n   with \"==\"\
    \ in Figure 4) to the primary PE on the other side.  This is\n   an unnecessary\
    \ replication of the customer frames and consumes core-\n   network bandwidth\
    \ (half of the frames get discarded at the receiving\n   PE).  This issue is aggravated\
    \ when there are more than two PEs per\n   provider access network -- e.g., if\
    \ there are three PEs or four PEs\n   per access network, then 67% or 75%, respectively,\
    \ of core-network\n   bandwidth for multicast, broadcast, and unknown unicast\
    \ are\n   respectively wasted.\n   Therefore, it is recommended to have a protocol\
    \ among PEs that can\n   disseminate the status of PWs (active or blocked) among\
    \ themselves.\n   Furthermore, it is recommended to have the protocol tied up\
    \ with the\n   redundancy mechanism such that (per VPLS instance) the status of\n\
    \   active/backup PE gets reflected on the corresponding PWs emanating\n   from\
    \ that PE.\n   The above discussion was centered on the inefficiency regarding\n\
    \   packet replication over MPLS core networks for current VPLS\n   redundancy\
    \ mechanism.  Another important issue to consider is the\n   interaction between\
    \ customer and service provider redundancy\n   mechanisms, especially when customer\
    \ devices are IEEE bridges.  If\n   CEs are IEEE bridges, then they can run RSTPs\
    \ or MSTPs.  RSTP\n   convergence and detection time is much faster than its predecessor\n\
    \   (IEEE 802.1D STP, which is obsolete).  Therefore, if the provider\n   network\
    \ offers a VPLS redundancy mechanism, then it should provide\n   transparency\
    \ to the customer's network during a failure within its\n   network, e.g., the\
    \ failure detection and recovery time within the\n   service provider network\
    \ should be less than the one in the customer\n   network.  If this is not the\
    \ case, then a failure within the provider\n   network can result in unnecessary\
    \ switch-over and temporary\n   flooding/loop within the customer's network that\
    \ is dual-homed.\n"

    \ be applied to VPLS\n   networks.  This mechanism calls for disabling MAC address\
    \ learning\n   for an S-VLAN (or a service instance) within a provider bridge\
    \ (or\n   PE) when there is only one ingress and one egress port associated\n\
    \   with that service instance on that PE.  In such cases, there is no\n   need\
    \ to learn customer MAC addresses on that PE since the path\n   through that PE\
    \ for that service instance is fixed.  For example, if\n   a service instance\
    \ is associated with four CEs at four different\n   sites, then the maximum number\
    \ of provider bridges (or PEs) that need\n   to participate in that customer MAC\
    \ address learning is only three,\n   regardless of how many PEs are in the path\
    \ of that service instance.\n   This mechanism can reduce the number of MAC addresses\
    \ learned in a\n   hierarchical VPLS (H-VPLS) with QinQ access configuration.\n\
    \   If the provider access network is of type Ethernet (e.g., IEEE\n   802.1ad-based\
    \ network), then the MSTP can be used to partition the\n   access network into\
    \ several loop-free spanning tree topologies where\n   Ethernet service instances\
    \ (S-VLANs) are distributed among these tree\n   topologies.  Furthermore, GVRP\
    \ can be used to limit the scope of each\n   service instance to a subset of its\
    \ associated tree topology (thus\n   limiting the scope of customer MAC address\
    \ learning to that sub-\n   tree).  Finally, the MAC address disabling mechanism\
    \ (described\n   above) can be applied to that sub-tree to further limit the number\
    \ of\n   nodes (PEs) on that sub-tree that need to learn customer MAC\n   addresses\
    \ for that service instance.\n   Furthermore, [802.1ah] provides the capability\
    \ of encapsulating\n   customers' MAC addresses within the provider MAC header.\
    \  A MTU-s\n   capable of this functionality can significantly reduce the number\
    \ of\n   MAC addresses learned within the provider network for H-VPLS with\n \
    \  QinQ access, as well as H-VPLS with MPLS access.\n"

    \   Therefore, if a PE is modeled based on Figures 1 and 2, which include\n  \
    \ a [802.1ad] bridge module, then it should operate seamlessly with\n   Provider\
    \ Bridges given that the issues discussed in this document\n   have been taken\

  - "8.  Security Considerations\n   In addition to the security issues described\
    \ in [RFC4762], the\n   following considerations apply:\n   - When a CE that is\
    \ a customer bridge is connected to the VPLS\n     network, it may be desirable\
    \ to secure the end-to-end communication\n     between the customer bridge nodes\
    \ across the VPLS network.  This\n     can be accomplished by running [802.1AE]\
    \ MAC security between the\n     C-VLAN components of the customer bridges.  In\
    \ this case, the VPLS\n     PEs must ensure transparent delivery of the encryption/security\n\
    \     protocol datagrams using the Bridge Group Address [802.1ad].\n   - When\
    \ a CE that is a customer bridge is connected to the VPLS\n     network, it may\
    \ be desirable to secure the communication between\n     the customer bridge and\
    \ its directly connected PE.  If the PE is\n     modeled to include a [802.1ad]\
    \ bridge module, then this can be\n     achieved by running MAC security between\
    \ the customer bridge and\n     the S-VLAN component of the VPLS PE as described\
    \ in Section 7.7.2\n     of [802.1AX].\n   - When an 802.1ad network is connected\
    \ to a VPLS network, it is\n     possible to secure the NNI between the two networks\
    \ using the\n     procedures of [802.1AE] and [802.1AX] between the S-VLAN components\n\
    \     of the Provider Edge Bridge and the attached VPLS PE, as long as\n     the\
    \ PE is modeled to include an [802.1ad] bridge module.\n"
