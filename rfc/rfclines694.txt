This file contains information on the various protocols in the ARPA Network.
An effort will be made to keep the information current, but his depends on the cooperation of the users of this file to convey any information about protocol developments, or corrections to this information to Jon Postel at SRI ARC.

This is a compendium of all the protocol related activity and most of this activity and most of this activity is with experimental protocols, for those protocols, which are official standards the designation "[Official]" will be appended to the name.
This protocol information file is online as:
Much of the documentation of protocols appears as Requests for Comments (RFCs) and many of these are available online.
When a document is accessible online a pointer to that source will be given.
Also note that recent RFCs are online at Office 1 in directory <NETINFO> with names of the form RFCnnn.
TXT where nnn is replaced by the RFC number.
There is also an index of recent RFCs as an online file:
There are three other online files that are relevant to protocols: There is a file that lists Official Host Names and associated information as described in RFC 608, the pathname of this file is: [Office 1]
There are two files that list the addresses of the Network Liaisons, one file lists the online message address, and the other the US Mail address and phone number.
A network liaison is a person designated by a host organization as the contact and coordinator for network technical information fro that organization.
These files are prepared by Jake Feinler of the Network Information Center (NIC).
Indeed the NIC has been very helpful in providing the online file space for the recent Request for Comments, and other protocol related files.
The NIC also maintains the hardcopy reference library of all RFCs.
The NIC has assembled and filed with the National Technical information Service the collection of documents known as "ARPA Network Current Network Protocols".
This collection represents the more or less "official" protocols as of 1 December 74.
The accession number is ADA003890.

Documents: "Specification for the Interconnection of a HOST and an IMP," BBN Report 1822, Revised December 1974.
Comments: The "link number" field has been extended from 8 to 12 bits and renamed the "message identification" field.
Message type 6 now is used to indicate a reason for at type 7 (destination dead) message.
There has been some recent changes to the Ready line interpretation by the IMP for deciding the alive/dead status of a host.
Important changes to the IMP and IMP/HOST Interface announced in RFC 660 23 Oct 74.
The change to allow up to eight messages to be in transit between a source host and destination host should be made very soon.
This should not effect the hosts at all except to provide better thruput and fewer inter message delays.
(6 JAN 75) BBN Report 1822 updated.
Sections 1, 2, 4, and 5, and Appendix C now include data on the Pluribus IMP.
The Pluribus IMP is based on a modular mutliprocessor hardware design; it should be capable of much higher bandwidth and greater reliability than other IMP models.
Section 3.1 contains additional information, which may be helpful to Host programmers.
Section 3.3 and 3.4 add a new type of Host to Host data message, the uncontrolled packet.
Section 3.7 has been added to describe the use of this new message type.
Section 3.4 describes changes to the sub types of IMP to host message types 6 and 7.
Appendix A has been updated.
Appendix B has been expanded to provide specific recommendations for Host implementation of the Host/IMP Interface.
Minor clarifications have been made in Appendix F.
(No changes have been made to Figure F (or F 9.)
Recent developments: (18 June 75) Very important changes to the Host to IMP and IMP to Host interface protocol are proposed (specified?) in a recent note.
The areas changed include: expanded leader size, expanded address field, new message length field, expanded handling type field, source host control of packets per message, change in the handling of unordered messages (current type 3 messages), change in the addressing of fake hosts, including an address field in the IMP/Host hop message, (best of all) backward compatibility, and a possible change in the maximum message length.

The BBN TIP and TENEX groups have specified and are implementing additional protocol commands with the intention of providing better reliability and survivability over system malfunctions.
The additional protocol commands are for cleaning up partly closed connections and resynchronizing the allocation values on open connections (see RFC 636).
Tenex 1.32 and the Tips are now running this protocol.

Implementation of full protocol to begin by 1 Jan 75.
Specification completed August 4th, but some work still in progress on handling of single message conversations.
A new sequencing scheme (proposed by Tomlinson) may be utilized.
The addressing field is now used as 4 bit format, 4 bit network, 16 bit TCP, and 24 bit process&port.
Crocker has suggested a 64 bit path address to be parsed and reformatted by the gateways along the route.
There is reluctance to experiment with too many things at once though.
A file indicating some of the changes in the specifications since the 4 Aug 74 document is now available as [ISI]
The areas of change are "Initial Sequence Number", "Socket definition", "Additional User System Calls", "Packet Format", and "Discussion of opening and closing (SYN, REL)".
(23 NOV 74) Specifications for test implementation are now said to be ready on 1 DEC 74, and an implementation completed by 1  FEB 74.

Recent developments: (30 May 75) Status of TCP development.
The BBN version is running at BBN TENEXA, but simulates a lot of JSYS calls which will be cast into the tenex operating system during the summer.
The SU DSL version for the PDP 11/20 is in the debugging stage.
The UCL (London) version for a PDP 9 is in the coding stage.
We are continuing with the "three way handshake" version which is highly reliable in environments which permit packets to be delivered on the order of hours later than they were injected into the connected networks.
A simple TCP is being designed for the packet radio network and does not use three way handshake since waiting a second or so to clear out old packets in not serious.
A test plan for packet radio net, arpanet, and atlantic satellite networks is in preparation (delivery date 1 August 1975).
Recent international agreements indicate that a form of TCP with a simpler header (144 bits instead of 256 bits) and no three way handshake is the most likely international standard.
6.1 Recommendation to CCITT stated that the maximum packet delay through all concatenated networks should not exceed 30 seconds.

Specifications for the Network Voice Protocol (NVP)
Comments: Specification document available (10 Oct 74).
An initial version of NVP was implemented for real time voice experiments between ISI and Lincoln Laboratory in August 1974.
An expanded version has been in operation since December 1974 for real time voice communication between Lincoln and CHI.
NVP uses both type 0 and type 3 IMP Host messages, and allows increased bandwidth and decreased delays at the cost of reliability.

Recent developments: NATIONAL SOFTWARE WORKS
The national Software Works (NSW) is developing a set of protocols for its use of the ARPA Network, other uses of these protocols is encouraged.
The Distributed Programming System (DPS) is intended to facilitate the sharing of resources in the network at the subroutine level.
The Distributed Programming System will be used to split NLS into a front end and back end components.
Distributed Programming system is also to be used in the NSW and the basis for communication between the Works Manager, the Tool Bearing Hosts, and Front End procedure packages.
The documents cited below give a view of the Distributed Programming System and its use.
The documents cited here represent the state of the protocol in January 75, much as changed since that time that has not been adequately documented, therefore, these documents should be viewed as generally descriptive not specifically definitive.
Each is available online in two forms: as an NLS file and as a formatted text file.
The Journal number (e.g., 24459) refers to the former, of course and the pathname (e.g., [BBNB]
<NLS>PCP.TXT) to the latter, accessible via FTP using username ANONYMOUS and password GUEST (no account required).
In addition, these documents are available from Jon Postel in hardcopy.

" This document defines an implementation, appropriate for mediating communication between processes on different hosts within the ARPANET, of the IPC primitives required by PCP.
Tenex PCP Process internal Structure" This document defines the internal structure of a PCP process implemented to run on Tenex, and as such serves as a process implementer's guide.
It describes the process' fork structure, the role and composition of each fork, and the manner in which the various forks interact with one another; indicates which components are supplied with PCP and which are the responsibility of the process implementer; and describes the manner in which the components are assembled at load time.
<NLS>PCPTNXINT.TXT HOST (24581,) "NSW Host Protocol"
This document describes the host level protocol used in the NSW.
The protocol is a slightly constrained version of the standard ARPANET host to host protocol.
The constraints affect the allocation, RFNM wait, and retransmission policies.
The Executive Package" This document describes a package that runs in the setting provided by PCP.
It includes procedures and data stores for user identification, accounting, and usage information.
"The File Package" This document describes a package that runs in the setting provided by PCP.
It includes procedures and data stores for opening, closing, and listing directories, for creating, deleting, and renaming files, and for transferring the files and file elements between processes.
FILE APP (24813,) "The File Package Appendix
" This appendix contains some comments on implementation strategy.
The thrust is to argue that the file package as specified is near minimal and that the conversion between the PCP format and the internal storage format can be encapsulated into a few subroutines.
This document describes a package that urns in the setting provided by PCP.
It includes procedures for creating and deleting batch jobs, obtaining the status of a batch job, and communicating with the operator of a batch processing host.
This package is implemented at the host that provides the batch processing facility.
