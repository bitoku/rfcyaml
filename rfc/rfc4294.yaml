- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   The goal of this document is to define the common functionality\n\
    \   required from both IPv6 hosts and routers.  Many IPv6 nodes will\n   implement\
    \ optional or additional features, but this document\n   summarizes requirements\
    \ from other published Standards Track\n   documents in one place.\n   This document\
    \ tries to avoid discussion of protocol details, and\n   references RFCs for this\
    \ purpose.  This document is informational in\n   nature and does not update Standards\
    \ Track RFCs.\n   Although the document points to different specifications, it\
    \ should\n   be noted that in most cases, the granularity of requirements are\n\
    \   smaller than a single specification, as many specifications define\n   multiple,\
    \ independent pieces, some of which may not be mandatory.\n   As it is not always\
    \ possible for an implementer to know the exact\n   usage of IPv6 in a node, an\
    \ overriding requirement for IPv6 nodes is\n   that they should adhere to Jon\
    \ Postel's Robustness Principle:\n      Be conservative in what you do, be liberal\
    \ in what you accept from\n      others [RFC-793].\n"

    \  Therefore,\n   it is important to develop the requirements for IPv6 nodes to\
    \ ensure\n   interoperability.\n   This document assumes that all IPv6 nodes meet\
    \ the minimum\n   requirements specified here.\n"

  contents:
  - "3.  Sub-IP Layer\n   An IPv6 node must include support for one or more IPv6 link-layer\n\
    \   specifications.  Which link-layer specifications are included will\n   depend\
    \ upon what link-layers are supported by the hardware available\n   on the system.\
    \  It is possible for a conformant IPv6 node to support\n   IPv6 on some of its\
    \ interfaces and not on others.\n   As IPv6 is run over new layer 2 technologies,\
    \ it is expected that new\n   specifications will be issued.  This section highlights\

- title: 4.2.  Neighbor Discovery for IPv6 - RFC 2461
  contents:
  - "4.2.  Neighbor Discovery for IPv6 - RFC 2461\n   Neighbor Discovery SHOULD be\
    \ supported.  [RFC-2461] states:\n      \"Unless specified otherwise (in a document\
    \ that covers operating\n      IP over a particular link type) this document applies\
    \ to all link\n      types.  However, because ND uses link-layer multicast for\
    \ some of\n      its services, it is possible that on some link types (e.g., NBMA\n\
    \      links) alternative protocols or mechanisms to implement those\n      services\
    \ will be specified (in the appropriate document covering\n      the operation\
    \ of IP over a particular link type).  The services\n      described in this document\
    \ that are not directly dependent on\n      multicast, such as Redirects, Next-hop\
    \ determination, Neighbor\n      Unreachability Detection, etc., are expected\
    \ to be provided as\n      specified in this document.  The details of how one\
    \ uses ND on\n      NBMA links is an area for further study.\"\n   Some detailed\
    \ analysis of Neighbor Discovery follows:\n   Router Discovery is how hosts locate\
    \ routers that reside on an\n   attached link.  Router Discovery MUST be supported\
    \ for\n   implementations.\n   Prefix Discovery is how hosts discover the set\
    \ of address prefixes\n   that define which destinations are on-link for an attached\
    \ link.\n   Prefix discovery MUST be supported for implementations.  Neighbor\n\
    \   Unreachability Detection (NUD) MUST be supported for all paths\n   between\
    \ hosts and neighboring nodes.  It is not required for paths\n   between routers.\
    \  However, when a node receives a unicast Neighbor\n   Solicitation (NS) message\
    \ (that may be a NUD's NS), the node MUST\n   respond to it (i.e., send a unicast\
    \ Neighbor Advertisement).\n   Duplicate Address Detection MUST be supported on\
    \ all links supporting\n   link-layer multicast (RFC 2462, Section 5.4, specifies\
    \ DAD MUST take\n   place on all unicast addresses).\n   A host implementation\
    \ MUST support sending Router Solicitations.\n   Receiving and processing Router\
    \ Advertisements MUST be supported for\n   host implementations.  The ability\
    \ to understand specific Router\n   Advertisement options is dependent on supporting\
    \ the specification\n   where the RA is specified.\n   Sending and Receiving Neighbor\
    \ Solicitation (NS) and Neighbor\n   Advertisement (NA) MUST be supported.  NS\
    \ and NA messages are\n   required for Duplicate Address Detection (DAD).\n  \
    \ Redirect functionality SHOULD be supported.  If the node is a router,\n   Redirect\
    \ functionality MUST be supported.\n"

    \ IPsec RFCs, but updates to these RFCs will\n   be published in the near future.\
    \  DES provides 56 bits of protection,\n   which is no longer considered sufficient.\n\
    \   The use of the HMAC-SHA-1-96 algorithm [RFC-2404] within AH and ESP\n   MUST\
    \ be supported.  The use of the HMAC-MD5-96 algorithm [RFC-2403]\n   within AH\
    \ and ESP MAY also be supported.\n   The 3DES-CBC encryption algorithm [RFC-2451]\
    \ does not suffer from the\n   same security issues as DES-CBC, and the 3DES-CBC\
    \ algorithm within\n   ESP MUST be supported to ensure interoperability.\n   The\
    \ AES-128-CBC algorithm [RFC-3602] MUST also be supported within\n   ESP.  AES-128\
    \ is expected to be a widely available, secure, and\n   efficient algorithm. \
    \ While AES-128-CBC is not required by the\n   current IPsec RFCs, it is expected\
    \ to become required in the future.\n"

    \   delineate between multiple keys.\n   Key management SHOULD be supported. \
    \ Examples of key management\n   systems include IKEv2 [RFC-4306] and Kerberos;\
    \ S/MIME and TLS include\n   key management functions.\n   Where key refresh,\
    \ anti-replay features of AH and ESP, or on-demand\n   creation of Security Associations\
    \ (SAs) is required, automated keying\n   MUST be supported.\n   Key management\
    \ methods for multicast traffic are also being worked on\n   by the MSEC WG.\n"
