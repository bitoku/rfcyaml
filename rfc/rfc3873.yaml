  - "Abstract\n   The Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) is a reliable\n\
    \   transport protocol operating on top of a connectionless packet\n   network\
    \ such as IP.  It is designed to transport public switched\n   telephone network\
    \ (PSTN) signaling messages over the connectionless\n   packet network, but is\
    \ capable of broader applications.\n   This memo defines the Management Information\
    \ Base (MIB) module which\n   describes the minimum set of objects needed to manage\
    \ the\n   implementation of the SCTP.\n"

  - "1.  Introduction\n   This memo defines the Management Information Base (MIB)\
    \ module which\n   describes managed objects for implementations of the SCTP.\n\
    \   The document starts with a brief description of the SNMP framework\n   and\
    \ continues with the MIB explanation and security consideration\n   sections among\
    \ others.\n   The managed objects in this MIB module are based on [RFC2012] update:\n\
    \   \"Management Information Base for the Transmission Control Protocol\n   (TCP)\"\
    \ referred as [TCPMIB] (work in progress), and RFC 3291 \"Textual\n   Conventions\
    \ for Internet Network Addresses\" [RFC3291].\n   Terms related to the SCTP architecture\
    \ are explained in [RFC2960].\n   Other specific abbreviations are listed below.\n\

    \ tables)\n   using SNMP.\n   It is NOT possible to delete rows in any table using\
    \ SNMP except in\n   sctpAssocTable under the particular conditions explained\
    \ below.\n"
- title: 3.1.3.1.  Association Table
  contents:
  - "3.1.3.1.  Association Table\n   The sctpAssocTable  is the main MIB table, where\
    \ all the association\n   related information is stored on a per association basis.\
    \  It is\n   structured according to expanded tables.  The main table is called\n\
    \   sctpAssocTable and is indexed by sctpAssocId (the association\n   identification).\
    \  This is a value that uniquely identifies an\n   association.  The MIB does\
    \ not restrict what value must be written\n   here, however it must be unique\
    \ within the table.\n   The sctpAssoc index is also shared by two more tables:\n\
    \      -  sctpAssocLocalAddrTable: to store the local IP address(es).\n      -\
    \  sctpAssocRemAddrTable: to store the remote addresses and the\n         per-remote-address\
    \ related information.\n   Entries in the sctpAssocTable are created when trying\
    \ to establish\n   the association, i.e., when sending the COOKIE-ECHO message\n\
    \   (originating side) or the COOKIE-ACK message (server side).  At this\n   point,\
    \ i.e., at established state, all entry fields are filled in\n   with valid values.\n\
    \   Note: The following representation is a conceptual mode of describing\n  \
    \ the relationship between the tables in this MIB.  Note that the real\n   relationship\
    \ of the tables is by sharing an index, so tables are not\n   truly within tables.\
    \  Every entry is explained when defining the\n   corresponding objects in the\

    \ sctpAssocRemAddrStartTime\n   Both sctpAssocLocalAddrTable and sctpAssocRemAddrTable\
    \ are indexed by\n   addresses.  'Addr' and 'AddrType' use the syntax InetAddress\
    \ and\n   InetAddressType defined in the Textual Conventions for Internet\n  \
    \ Network Address (RFC3291).  The InetAddressType TC has codepoints for\n   unknown,\
    \ IPv4, IPv6, non-global IPv4, non-global IPv6, and DNS\n   addresses, but only\
    \ the IPv4 and IPv6 address types are required to\n   be supported by implementations\
    \ of this MIB module.  Implementations\n   that connect multiple zones are expected\
    \ to support the non-global\n   IPv4 and non-global IPv6 address types as well.\n\
    \   Note that DNS addresses are not used in this MIB module.  They are\n   always\
    \ resolved to the on-the-wire form prior to connection setup,\n   and the on-the-wire\
    \ form is what appears in the MIB objects.\n   The sctpAssocLocalAddrTable table\
    \ will have as many entries as local\n   IP addresses have been defined for the\
    \ association.  The\n   sctpAssocRemAddrTable table will contain as many entries\
    \ as remote IP\n   addresses are known to reach the peer.  For the multihoming\
    \ concept\n   see reference RFC2960.\n   To keep the name of the remote peer (when\
    \ provided by the peer at\n   initialization time), an entry has been created\
    \ in the sctpAssocTable\n   called sctpAssocRemHostName.  When no DNS name is\
    \ provided by the\n   remote endpoint, this value will be NULL (zero-length string).\n\
    \   Otherwise, the received DNS name will be stored here.\n   If it is necessary\
    \ to abort an existing association, the value\n   deleteTCB(9) must be written\
    \ in the variable sctpAssocState.  That is\n   the only way to delete rows in\
    \ any of the mentioned tables.\n"
- title: 3.1.3.2.  Reverse Lookup Table
  contents:
  - "3.1.3.2.  Reverse Lookup Table\n   There are five reverse lookup tables to help\
    \ management applications\n   efficiently access conceptual rows in other tables.\
    \  These tables\n   allow management applications to avoid expensive tree walks\
    \ through\n   large numbers of associations.\n   All of these tables are optional.\
    \  If these tables are implemented,\n   an entry in them must be created after\
    \ the entry in the main table\n   (sctpAssocTable) associated with it has been\
    \ created.  This ensures\n   that the field indexing the lookup table exists.\n\
    \   The defined reverse lookup tables allow for performing a lookup using\n  \
    \ the following variables:\n      -  Local Port: It allows a management application\

- title: 7.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "7.  Security Considerations\n   There are management objects defined in this\
    \ MIB that have a MAX-\n   ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such\
    \ objects may be\n   considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.\
    \  The\n   support for SET operations in a non-secure environment without proper\n\
    \   protection can have a negative effect on network operations.  These\n   are\
    \ the tables and objects and their sensitivity/vulnerability:\n   o  The sctpAssocState\
    \ object has a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write,\n      which allows termination\
    \ of an arbitrary connection.  Unauthorized\n      access could cause a denial\
    \ of service.\n   Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects\
    \ with a\n   MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered sensitive\
    \ or\n   vulnerable in some network environments.  Thus, it is important to\n\
    \   control even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly\n   to\
    \ even encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over\n   the network\
    \ via SNMP.  These are the tables and objects and their\n   sensitivity/vulnerability:\n\
    \   o  The sctpAssocTable, sctpAssocLocalAddressTable,\n      sctpAssocRemAddressTable\
    \ and the lookup tables contain objects\n      providing information on the active\
    \ associations on the device,\n      local and peer's IP addresses, the status\
    \ of these associations\n      and the associated processes.  This information\
    \ may be used by an\n      attacker to launch attacks against known/unknown weakness\
    \ in\n      certain protocols/applications.\n   o  The sctpAssocTable contains\
    \ objects providing information on local\n      and remote ports objects, that\
    \ can be used to identify what ports\n      are open on the machine and can thus\
    \ suggest what attacks are\n      likely to succeed, without the attacker having\
    \ to run a port\n      scanner.\n   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include\
    \ adequate security.\n   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by\
    \ using IPSec),\n   even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network\
    \ is\n   allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects\n\
    \   in this MIB module.\n   It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security\
    \ features as\n   provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8),\n\
    \   including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for\n   authentication\
    \ and privacy).\n   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT\n\
    \   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to\n   enable\
    \ cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator\n   responsibility to\
    \ ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an\n   instance of this MIB module\
    \ is properly configured to give access to\n   the objects only to those principals\
    \ (users) that have legitimate\n   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete)\
    \ them.\n   The above objects also have privacy implications, i.e., they disclose\n\
    \   who is connecting to what hosts.  These are sensitive from a\n   perspective\
    \ of preventing traffic analysis, and also to protect\n   individual privacy.\n"
