- title: Abstract
  contents:
  - "Abstract\n   This memo describes a backward-compatible technique that may be\
    \ used\n   by OSPF (Open Shortest Path First) implementations to advertise\n \
    \  unavailability to forward transit traffic or to lower the preference\n   level\
    \ for the paths through such a router.  In some cases, it is\n   desirable not\
    \ to route transit traffic via a specific OSPF router.\n   However, OSPF does\
    \ not specify a standard way to accomplish this.\n"
- title: 1. Motivation
  contents:
  - "1. Motivation\n   In some situations, it may be advantageous to inform routers\
    \ in a\n   network not to use a specific router as a transit point, but still\n\
    \   route to it.  Possible situations include the following.\n      o  The router\
    \ is in a critical condition (for example, has very\n         high CPU load or\
    \ does not have enough memory to store all LSAs\n         or build the routing\
    \ table).\n      o  Graceful introduction and removal of the router to/from the\n\
    \         network.\n      o  Other (administrative or traffic engineering) reasons.\n\
    \   Note that the proposed solution does not remove the router from the\n   topology\
    \ view of the network (as could be done by just flushing that\n   router's router-LSA),\
    \ but prevents other routers from using it for\n   transit routing, while still\
    \ routing packets to router's own IP\n   addresses, i.e., the router is announced\
    \ as stub.\n   It must be emphasized that the proposed solution provides real\n\
    \   benefits in networks designed with at least some level of redundancy\n   so\
    \ that traffic can be routed around the stub router.  Otherwise,\n   traffic destined\
    \ for the networks reachable through such a stub\n   router will be still routed\
    \ through it.\n"
- title: 2. Proposed Solution
  contents:
  - "2. Proposed Solution\n   The solution described in this document solves two challenges\n\
    \   associated with the outlined problem.  In the description below,\n   router\
    \ X is the router announcing itself as a stub.\n      1) Making other routers\
    \ prefer routes around router X while\n         performing the Dijkstra calculation.\n\
    \      2) Allowing other routers to reach IP prefixes directly connected\n   \
    \      to router X.\n   Note that it would be easy to address issue 1) alone by\
    \ just flushing\n   router X's router-LSA from the domain.  However, it does not\
    \ solve\n   problem 2), since other routers will not be able to use links to\n\
    \   router X in Dijkstra (no back link), and because router X will not\n   have\
    \ links to its neighbors.\n   To address both problems, router X announces its\
    \ router-LSA to the\n   neighbors as follows.\n      o  costs of all non-stub\
    \ links (links of the types other than 3)\n         are set to LSInfinity (16-bit\
    \ value 0xFFFF, rather than 24-bit\n         value 0xFFFFFF used in summary and\
    \ AS-external LSAs).\n      o  costs of stub links (type 3) are set to the interface\
    \ output\n         cost.\n   This addresses issues 1) and 2).\n"
- title: 3. Compatibility issues
  contents:
  - "3. Compatibility issues\n   Some inconsistency may be seen when the network is\
    \ constructed of the\n   routers that perform intra-area Dijkstra calculation\
    \ as specified in\n   [RFC1247] (discarding link records in router-LSAs that have\n\
    \   LSInfinity cost value) and routers that perform it as specified in\n   [RFC1583]\
    \ and higher (do not treat links with LSInfinity cost as\n   unreachable).  Note\
    \ that this inconsistency will not lead to routing\n   loops, because if there\
    \ are some alternate paths in the network, both\n   types of routers will agree\
    \ on using them rather than the path\n   through the stub router.  If the path\
    \ through the stub router is the\n   only one, the routers of the first type will\
    \ not use the stub router\n   for transit (which is the desired behavior), while\
    \ the routers of the\n   second type will still use this path.\n"
