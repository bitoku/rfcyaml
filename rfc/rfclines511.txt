May 1973 Enterprise Phone Service to NIC From ARPANET Sites
In September 1971, NIC arranged for all Sites then on the Network to have phone service to NIC with all tolls billed to NIC.
In October, (7732,) a revised list of numbers established for Sites was issued.
Since then, some Sites have requested the service, and further arrangements have been made.
A list of present Enterprise and Zenith numbers is attached.
This list is accessible online through <NIC>LOCATOR.
would be much more expensive.
Enterprise numbers (Zenith in California) are billing arrangements which must be made separately for each prefix, not just each area code, so that even users in the same area usually need a special arrangement.
Although admittedly more awkward than an 800 number, the present arrangement costs about $800 per month; an 800 number would cost about $2200 per month.
Any Site actually on the Network which does not have an Enterprise number and would like to have one, is invited to call NIC to request one.
numbers for calls that are received from 5pm to 8am.
We apologize to any users who have found this service faulty recently.
We have reinstituted the service and assume it will be satisfactory in supplying information on the status of NIC operations at times other than 8 to 5 when our full staff is here.
Your comments on this would be appreciated.
