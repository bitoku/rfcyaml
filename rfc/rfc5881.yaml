    Detection\n   (BFD) [BFD] is to track IPv4 and IPv6 connectivity between directly\n
    \  connected systems.  This could be used to supplement the detection\n   mechanisms
    in routing protocols or to monitor router-host\n   connectivity, among other applications.\n
    \  This document describes the particulars necessary to use BFD in this\n   environment.
    \ Interactions between BFD and other protocols and system\n   functions are described

  title: 1.  Introduction
- contents:
  - "2.  Applications and Limitations\n   This application of BFD can be used by any
    pair of systems\n   communicating via IPv4 and/or IPv6 across a single IP hop
    that is\n   associated with an incoming interface.  This includes, but is not\n
    \  limited to, physical media, virtual circuits, and tunnels.\n   Each BFD session
    between a pair of systems MUST traverse a separate\n   network-layer path in both
    directions.  This is necessary for\n   demultiplexing to work properly, and also
    because (by definition)\n   multiple sessions would otherwise be protecting the
    same path.\n   If BFD is to be used in conjunction with both IPv4 and IPv6 on
    a\n   particular path, a separate BFD session MUST be established for each\n   protocol
    (and thus encapsulated by that protocol) over that link.\n   If the BFD Echo function
    is used, transmitted packets are immediately\n   routed back towards the sender
    on the interface over which they were\n   sent.  This may interact with other
    mechanisms that are used on the\n   two systems that employ BFD.  In particular,
    ingress filtering\n   [BCP38] is incompatible with the way Echo packets need to
    be sent.\n   Implementations that support the Echo function MUST ensure that\n
    \  ingress filtering is not used on an interface that employs the Echo\n   function
    or make an exception for ingress filtering Echo packets.\n   An implementation
    of the Echo function also requires Application\n   Programming Interfaces (APIs)
    that may not exist on all systems.  A\n   system implementing the Echo function
    MUST be capable of sending\n   packets to its own address, which will typically
    require bypassing\n   the normal forwarding lookup.  This typically requires access
    to APIs\n   that bypass IP-layer functionality.\n   Please note that BFD is intended
    as an Operations, Administration,\n   and Maintenance (OAM) mechanism for connectivity
    check and connection\n   verification.  It is applicable for network-based services
    (e.g.\n   router-to-router, subscriber-to-gateway, LSP/circuit endpoints, and\n
    \  service appliance failure detection).  In these scenarios it is\n   required
    that the operator correctly provision the rates at which BFD\n   is transmitted
    to avoid congestion (e.g link, I/O, CPU) and false\n   failure detection.  It
    is not applicable for application-to-\n   application failure detection across
    the Internet because it does not\n   have sufficient capability to do necessary
    congestion detection and\n   avoidance and therefore cannot prevent congestion
    collapse.  Host-to-\n   host or application-to-application deployment across the
    Internet\n   will require the encapsulation of BFD within a transport that\n   provides
    \"TCP-friendly\" [TFRC] behavior.\n"

  - "3.  Initialization and Demultiplexing\n   In this application, there will be
    only a single BFD session between\n   two systems over a given interface (logical
    or physical) for a\n   particular protocol.  The BFD session must be bound to
    this\n   interface.  As such, both sides of a session MUST take the \"Active\"\n
    \  role (sending initial BFD Control packets with a zero value of Your\n   Discriminator),
    and any BFD packet from the remote machine with a\n   zero value of Your Discriminator
    MUST be associated with the session\n   bound to the remote system, interface,
    and protocol.\n"
  title: 3.  Initialization and Demultiplexing
- contents:
  - "4.  Encapsulation\n   BFD Control packets MUST be transmitted in UDP packets
    with\n   destination port 3784, within an IPv4 or IPv6 packet.  The source\n   port
    MUST be in the range 49152 through 65535.  The same UDP source\n   port number
    MUST be used for all BFD Control packets associated with\n   a particular session.
    \ The source port number SHOULD be unique among\n   all BFD sessions on the system.
    \ If more than 16384 BFD sessions are\n   simultaneously active, UDP source port
    numbers MAY be reused on\n   multiple sessions, but the number of distinct uses
    of the same UDP\n   source port number SHOULD be minimized.  An implementation
    MAY use\n   the UDP port source number to aid in demultiplexing incoming BFD\n
    \  Control packets, but ultimately the mechanisms in [BFD] MUST be used\n   to
    demultiplex incoming packets to the proper session.\n   BFD Echo packets MUST
    be transmitted in UDP packets with destination\n   UDP port 3785 in an IPv4 or
    IPv6 packet.  The setting of the UDP\n   source port is outside the scope of this
    specification.  The\n   destination address MUST be chosen in such a way as to
    cause the\n   remote system to forward the packet back to the local system.  The\n
    \  source address MUST be chosen in such a way as to preclude the remote\n   system
    from generating ICMP or Neighbor Discovery Redirect messages.\n   In particular,
    the source address SHOULD NOT be part of the subnet\n   bound to the interface
    over which the BFD Echo packet is being\n   transmitted, and it SHOULD NOT be
    an IPv6 link-local address, unless\n   it is known by other means that the remote
    system will not send\n   Redirects.\n   BFD Echo packets MUST be transmitted in
    such a way as to ensure that\n   they are received by the remote system.  On multiaccess
    media, for\n   example, this requires that the destination datalink address\n
    \  corresponds to the remote system.\n   The above requirements may require the
    bypassing of some common IP\n   layer functionality, particularly in host implementations.\n"

  - "5.  TTL/Hop Limit Issues\n   If BFD authentication is not in use on a session,
    all BFD Control\n   packets for the session MUST be sent with a Time to Live (TTL)
    or Hop\n   Limit value of 255.  All received BFD Control packets that are\n   demultiplexed
    to the session MUST be discarded if the received TTL or\n   Hop Limit is not equal
    to 255.  A discussion of this mechanism can be\n   found in [GTSM].\n   If BFD
    authentication is in use on a session, all BFD Control packets\n   MUST be sent
    with a TTL or Hop Limit value of 255.  All received BFD\n   Control packets that
    are demultiplexed to the session MAY be\n   discarded if the received TTL or Hop
    Limit is not equal to 255.  If\n   the TTL/Hop Limit check is made, it MAY be
    done before any\n   cryptographic authentication takes place if this will avoid\n
    \  unnecessary calculation that would be detrimental to the receiving\n   system.\n
    \  In the context of this section, \"authentication in use\" means that\n   the
    system is sending BFD Control packets with the Authentication bit\n   set and
    with the Authentication Section included and that all\n   unauthenticated packets
    demultiplexed to the session are discarded,\n   per the BFD base specification.\n"
  title: 5.  TTL/Hop Limit Issues
- contents:
  - "6.  Addressing Issues\n   Implementations MUST ensure that all BFD Control packets
    are\n   transmitted over the one-hop path being protected by BFD.\n   On a multiaccess
    network, BFD Control packets MUST be transmitted\n   with source and destination
    addresses that are part of the subnet\n   (addressed from and to interfaces on
    the subnet).\n   On a point-to-point link, the source address of a BFD Control
    packet\n   MUST NOT be used to identify the session.  This means that the\n   initial
    BFD packet MUST be accepted with any source address, and that\n   subsequent BFD
    packets MUST be demultiplexed solely by the Your\n   Discriminator field (as is
    always the case).  This allows the source\n   address to change if necessary.
    \ If the received source address\n   changes, the local system MUST NOT use that
    address as the\n   destination in outgoing BFD Control packets; rather, it MUST
    continue\n   to use the address configured at session creation.  An implementation\n
    \  MAY notify the application that the neighbor's source address has\n   changed,
    so that the application might choose to change the\n   destination address or
    take some other action.  Note that the TTL/Hop\n   Limit check described in section
    5 (or the use of authentication)\n   precludes the BFD packets from having come
    from any source other than\n   the immediate neighbor.\n"

  - "7.  BFD for Use with Tunnels\n   A number of mechanisms are available to tunnel
    IPv4 and IPv6 over\n   arbitrary topologies.  If the tunnel mechanism does not
    decrement the\n   TTL or Hop Limit of the network protocol carried within, the\n
    \  mechanism described in this document may be used to provide liveness\n   detection
    for the tunnel.  The BFD authentication mechanism SHOULD be\n   used and is strongly
    encouraged.\n"

  - "9.  Security Considerations\n   In this application, the use of TTL=255 on transmit
    and receive,\n   coupled with an association to an incoming interface, is viewed
    as\n   supplying equivalent security characteristics to other protocols used\n
    \  in the infrastructure, as it is not trivially spoofable.  The\n   security
    implications of this mechanism are further discussed in\n   [GTSM].\n   The security
    implications of the use of BFD authentication are\n   discussed in [BFD].\n   The
    use of the TTL=255 check simultaneously with BFD authentication\n   provides a
    low overhead mechanism for discarding a class of\n   unauthorized packets and
    may be useful in implementations in which\n   cryptographic checksum use is susceptible
    to denial-of-service\n   attacks.  The use or non-use of this mechanism does not
    impact\n   interoperability.\n"
