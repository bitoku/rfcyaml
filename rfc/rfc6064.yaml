- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   3GPP has specified the Packet-switched Streaming Service\
    \ (PSS) that\n   uses both RTSP [RFC2326] and SDP [RFC4566].  The service is specified\n\
    \   in technical specifications TS 26.233 [PSS-233] and TS 26.234\n   [PSS-234]\
    \ in Release 4 and subsequent releases.  The basic service\n   defined in Release\
    \ 4 is enhanced in Release 5 with capability\n   exchange, and in Release 6 with\
    \ a number of features, such as\n   adaptation, digital rights management (DRM),\
    \ progressive download, as\n   well as a streaming server file format defined\
    \ in [PSS-3GP].  Fast\n   start-up and content switching are addressed in Release\
    \ 7.\n   3GPP has also specified the Multimedia Broadcast/Multicast Service\n\
    \   (MBMS) that uses SDP.  The IP-layer protocols used by this service\n   are\
    \ specified in technical specification TS 26.346 Release 6 [MBMS].\n   Release\
    \ 7 extends the MBMS User Service to also work with unicast\n   bearers for interactive\
    \ and streaming traffic classes.\n   In the process of defining these services,\
    \ there has occasionally\n   been a need to extend both SDP and RTSP functionalities.\
    \  These\n   extensions have mostly been in the form of SDP attributes and RTSP\n\
    \   headers and option tags. 3GPP uses the name \"feature tags\" (like RTSP\n\
    \   2.0 for what RTSP 1.0 calls \"option tags\"); \"option tag\" is the name\n\
    \   that will be used in this document.  The purpose of this\n   informational\
    \ document is to register these SDP and RTSP extensions,\n   in order to avoid\
    \ future conflicts, and also to raise the awareness\n   of their existence within\
    \ IETF.\n   In Section 5.4, this document defines three SDP protocol identifiers\n\
    \   used in MBMS to enable the usage of block-based FEC.  The SDP\n   protocol\
    \ identifiers require an RFC to be defined and registered.  As\n   this is an\
    \ RFC from the IETF stream, any semantic change will require\n   a new IETF-approved\
    \ RFC.  The other SDP and RTSP extensions\n   registered by this document are\
    \ not normatively defined in this\n   document.  Instead, the normative definitions\
    \ are referenced by the\n   registrations. 3GPP can update the normative definition\
    \ in future\n   versions of their specifications.  However, to ensure that such\
    \ a\n   change is visible in the IETF, at minimum, IANA should be notified\n \
    \  and the reference to the 3GPP specification updated, and preferably\n   an\
    \ updated version of this RFC published.\n   The document begins with two sections\
    \ presenting the SDP extensions\n   for PSS and MBMS, respectively.  They are\
    \ followed by a section\n   noting that offer/answer considerations are not applicable\
    \ here.  The\n   subsequent section presents the extensions of RTSP for PSS. \
    \ The IANA\n   registration of SDP attributes and protocol identifiers is given\
    \ in\n   Section 8.1, and the RTSP headers and option tags in Section 8.2.\n \
    \  For normative descriptions of all SDP and RTSP extensions, we refer\n   to\
    \ TS 26.234 [PSS-234] and TS 26.346 [MBMS].\n"

- title: 3.  Applicability Statement
  contents:

    \ require further definitions or\n   clarifications.  For example, all SDP attributes\
    \ lack offer/answer\n   usage rules [RFC3264], which currently makes it impossible\
    \ to use\n   them with offer/answer.  Please note that change control of these\
    \ SDP\n   and RTSP extensions belongs to 3GPP.\n"
- title: 4.  PSS SDP Extensions
  contents:
  - "4.  PSS SDP Extensions\n   The PSS specification [PSS-234] defines a number of\
    \ different SDP\n   attributes for different purposes.  They are listed below,\
    \ grouped by\n   their purpose.  The text is intentionally not specific enough\
    \ to\n   allow implementation from this document.  The normative definition is\n\
    \   in the 3GPP technical specification cited.\n"
- title: 4.1.  Video Buffering Attributes
  contents:
  - "4.1.  Video Buffering Attributes\n   The following attributes are used to provide\
    \ parameters for the video\n   buffer model provided in Annex G and Section 5.3.3.2\
    \ of [PSS-234].\n   The attributes were defined in Release 5 as \"X-\" attributes\
    \ and, at\n   the time, were not considered for registration.  In hindsight,\n\
    \   however, they should not have been \"X-\" attributes, and they should\n  \
    \ have been registered, as the registration rules of SDP [RFC4566]\n   point out.\
    \  Changing their names today is impossible due to the\n   deployed base of millions\
    \ of mobile handsets supporting PSS, and\n   therefore they are registered in\
    \ their current form.\n   All attributes are defined at media level.\n   o  The\
    \ \"a=X-predecbufsize\" attribute provides the size of the pre-\n      decoder\
    \ buffer in bytes.\n   o  The \"a=X-initpredecbufperiod\" attribute provides the\
    \ time during\n      which a receiver should initially buffer, in 90 kHz ticks,\
    \ before\n      starting to consume the data in the buffer in order to ensure\
    \ that\n      underflow does not occur, assuming correct data delivery.\n   o\
    \  The \"a=X-initpostdecbufperiod\" attribute provides the initial\n      buffering\
    \ period, in 90 kHz ticks, for the post-decoder buffer\n      present in H.263\
    \ and MPEG-4 Visual.\n   o  The \"a=X-decbyterate\" attribute indicates the maximum\
    \ peak byte-\n      decoding rate used in the verification of the Annex G buffer\
    \ model\n      expressed in bytes per second.\n   o  The \"a=3gpp-videopostdecbufsize\"\
    \ attribute is used to indicate the\n      value used in determining the H.264\
    \ video post-decoder buffer\n      size.\n   Note that complete descriptions of\
    \ these attributes can be found in\n   Section 5.3.3.2 of [PSS-234].\n"

    \ K (Sections K.2.2.1, K.2.2.2, and K.2.2.3)\n   of [PSS-234].\n   o  The session-level\
    \ attribute \"a=3GPP-Integrity-Key\" carries the\n      integrity key used to\
    \ derive SRTP master keys for integrity\n      protection.  The key is protected\
    \ in different ways depending on a\n      method identifier.  When using Open\
    \ Mobile Alliance (OMA) DRM key\n      management, the key is encrypted using\
    \ AES [AES] before it is\n      base64 encoded [RFC4648].\n   o  The media-level\
    \ attribute \"a=3GPP-SRTP-Config\" is used to\n      configure SRTP for integrity\
    \ protection and contains an integrity\n      nonce, a key salt used in deriving\
    \ the SRTP master key from the\n      integrity key, and any SRTP configuration\
    \ parameters, such as the\n      integrity tag length.\n   o  The session-level\
    \ attribute \"a=3GPP-SDP-Auth\" is used to carry an\n      authentication tag\
    \ calculated over certain parts of the SDP to\n      prevent manipulation of the\
    \ security attributes.\n"
- title: 4.4.  The Alternative Attributes
  contents:
  - "4.4.  The Alternative Attributes\n   Two media-level and one session-level attributes\
    \ are used in a\n   mechanism for providing alternative SDP lines.  One or more\
    \ SDP lines\n   at media level can be replaced, if desired, by alternatives. \
    \ The\n   mechanism is backwards compatible in the way that a receiver that\n\
    \   does not support the attributes will get the default configuration.\n   The\
    \ different alternatives can be grouped using different attributes\n   that can\
    \ be specified hierarchically with a top and a lower level.\n   3GPP Release 6\
    \ supports grouping based on bit-rate, according to the\n   SDP bandwidth modifiers\
    \ AS [RFC4566] and TIAS [RFC3890], and\n   language.\n   The SDP attributes (see\
    \ Sections 5.3.3.3 and 5.3.3.4 of [PSS-234])\n   are:\n   o  The media-level attribute\
    \ \"a=alt:<id>:<SDP-Line>\" carries any SDP\n      line and an alternative identifier.\n\
    \   o  The media-level attribute \"a=alt-default-id:<id>\" identifies the\n  \
    \    default configuration to be used in groupings.\n   o  The session-level attribute\
    \ \"a=alt-group\" is used to group\n      different recommended media alternatives.\
    \  This allows providing\n      aggregated properties for the whole group according\
    \ to the\n      grouping type.  Language and bit-rate are two defined grouping\n\
    \      types.\n"

    \ contained within the generic URI syntax defined\n   for RTSP URIs.  It is only\
    \ a syntax restriction that server\n   manufacturers follow to allow clients or\
    \ proxies to understand what\n   encodes the track number in the URI.  This is\
    \ provided for\n   information only.\n   To identify a track within a 3GP file,\

  contents:
  - "9.  Security Considerations\n   SDP attributes are subject to modification by\
    \ an attacker unless they\n   are integrity protected and authenticated.  The\
    \ security\n   considerations of the SDP specification [RFC4566] should be reviewed\n\
    \   in this regard.  The registered SDP attributes are vulnerable to\n   modification\
    \ attacks or removal, which may result in problems of a\n   serious nature, including\
    \ failure to use service and reduced quality.\n   The registered RTSP headers\
    \ are also vulnerable to insertion,\n   deletion, or modification attacks similar\
    \ to SDP attributes.  Also in\n   this case, attacks can result in failure of\
    \ the service or reduced\n   quality of streaming content.\n   The three SDP protocol\
    \ identifiers do not by themselves introduce any\n   additional security threats\
    \ that don't exist for other protocol\n   identifiers in SDP.  The media stream\
    \ and the used protocols\n   identified and configured by the SDP protocol identifier\
    \ may,\n   however, contain security issues by themselves.\n"
