    \   for Uniform Resource Names (URNs) used to identify resources\n   published\
    \ by Cable Television Laboratories, Inc. (CableLabs).\n   CableLabs specifies\
    \ and manages resources that utilize this URN\n   identification model.  Management\
    \ activities for these and other\n   resource types are handled by the manager\
    \ of the CableLabs' Assigned\n   Names and Numbers registry.\n"

- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   CableLabs is a non-profit research and development consortium\
    \ that is\n   dedicated to pursuing new cable telecommunications technologies\
    \ and\n   to helping its cable operator members integrate those technical\n  \
    \ advancements into their business objectives.  Within CableLabs,\n   specification\
    \ activities are organized into projects such as\n   DOCSIS(R), PacketCable(TM),\
    \ and OpenCable(TM), and technical work is\n   conducted within focus teams. \
    \ Product vendors, manufacturers, and\n   cable operator members are invited to\
    \ join the focus teams that\n   create technical specifications.\n   Occasionally,\
    \ CableLabs specification efforts require identifiers in\n   a managed namespace\
    \ so that they are unique and persistent.  To\n   ensure that the uniqueness is\
    \ absolute, the registration of a\n   specific Uniform Resource Name (URN) [RFC2141]\
    \ Namespace Identifier\n   (NID) for use by CableLabs is being specified in this\
    \ document, in\n   full conformance with the NID registration process specified\
    \ in\n   [RFC3406].\n"
- title: 2.  URN Specification for CableLabs
  contents:
  - "2.  URN Specification for CableLabs\n   Namespace ID:\n        cablelabs\n  \
    \ Registration information:\n        registration version number: 1\n        registration\
    \ date: 2011-04-18\n   Declared registrant of the namespace:\n        Registering\
    \ organization\n           Name: Cable Television Laboratories, Inc.\n       \

    \   Declaration of syntactic structure:\n        The Namespace Specific String\
    \ (NSS) of all URNs that use the\n        \"cablelabs\" NID will have the following\
    \ structure:\n        {CLclass}:{CLClassSpecificString}\n        The \"CLclass\"\
    \ is a US-ASCII string that conforms to the URN\n        syntax requirements specified\
    \ in [RFC2141] and defines a\n        specific class of resource type.  Each class\
    \ will have a\n        specific labeling scheme that is covered by\n        \"\
    CLClassSpecificString\", which also conforms to the naming\n        requirements\
    \ of [RFC2141].\n        CableLabs maintains the CableLabs' Assigned Names and\
    \ Numbers\n        [CANN] specification that will contain the assignment of\n\
    \        CableLabs' resource classes and the specific registration values\n  \
    \      assigned for each resource class.\n   Relevant ancillary documentation:\n\
    \        CableLabs publishes information regarding the registered\n        resources\
    \ in the CableLabs' Assigned Names and Numbers\n        specification ([CANN]).\n\
    \   Identifier uniqueness considerations:\n        CableLabs will manage resource\
    \ classes using the \"cablelabs\" NID\n        and will be the authority for managing\
    \ resources and associated\n        subsequent strings.  CableLabs is expected\
    \ to guarantee the\n        uniqueness of the strings themselves, or it may permit\
    \ secondary\n        responsibility for certain defined resources.\n        CableLabs\
    \ could allow the use of experimental type values for\n        testing purposes\
    \ only.  Note that using experimental types may\n        create collisions as\
    \ multiple users may use the same values for\n        resources and specific strings.\n\
    \   Identifier persistence considerations:\n        CableLabs will update the\
    \ CableLabs' Assigned Names and Numbers\n        specification ([CANN]) to document\
    \ the registered resources that\n        use the \"cablelabs\" NID.\n   Process\
    \ of identifier assignment:\n        CableLabs will provide procedures for registration\
    \ of each type\n        of resource that it maintains.  Each such resource may\
    \ have\n        three types of registration activities:\n        1.   Registered\
    \ values associated with CableLabs documents or\n             services\n     \
    \   2.   Registration of values or sub-trees to other entities\n        3.   Name\
    \ models for use in experimental purposes\n   Process for identifier resolution:\n\
    \        The namespace is not listed with a resolution discovery system;\n   \
    \     this is not applicable for this URN registration.\n   Rules for lexical\
    \ equivalence:\n        No special considerations; the rules for lexical equivalence\
    \ of\n        [RFC2141] apply.\n   Conformance with URN syntax:\n        No special\
    \ considerations.\n   Validation mechanism:\n        None specified.  URN assignment\
    \ will be handled by procedures\n        implemented in support of CableLabs activities.\n\
    \   Scope:\n        Global\n"
- title: 3.  Example
  contents:
  - "3.  Example\n   The following example represents a hypothetical URN that could\
    \ be\n   assigned by CableLabs.\n   urn:cablelabs:packetcable-example:ue:rst-sample\n\
    \   This example defines the URN to be used for User Equipment (UE)\n   conforming\
    \ to the sample Residential SIP Telephony (RST) application\n   specified within\
    \ CableLabs' PacketCable RST specification suite.\n"
- title: 4.  Namespace Considerations
  contents:
  - "4.  Namespace Considerations\n   CableLabs develops specifications that may require\
    \ the use of data\n   models.  URN Namespaces are key constructs to manage the\
    \ definitions\n   of those data models reliably with persistence and uniqueness.\n\
    \   The use of URNs should also help specification authors to maintain\n   different\
    \ versions of URNs and dependencies between URNs across\n   different versions\
    \ of CableLabs specifications if they so wish.\n"
- title: 5.  Community Considerations
  contents:
  - "5.  Community Considerations\n   Participants involved in the development and\
    \ usage of CableLabs\n   specifications and cable industry deployments will benefit\
    \ from the\n   publication of this namespace by providing consistent and reliable\n\
    \   names for the XML namespaces, schema locations, and similar\n   identifiers\
    \ of physical data models published within CableLabs\n   specifications.\n   The\
    \ CableLabs specifications are publicly available and are licensed\n   to manufacturers\
    \ on a nondiscriminatory basis.  CableLabs will\n   maintain the allocation of\
    \ resources for the \"cablelabs\" NID within\n   the following specification:\
    \ \"CableLabs' Assigned Names and Numbers\"\n   [CANN], which will be publicly\
    \ available for viewing.  CableLabs will\n   also maintain the corresponding specifications\
    \ where the registered\n   resources are referenced or used.\n"
- title: 6.  IANA Considerations
  contents:
  - "6.  IANA Considerations\n   This document adds a new entry (\"cablelabs\") in\
    \ the urn-namespaces\n   registry.  This is the defining document.  The entry\
    \ can be found in\n   the \"Uniform Resource Names (URN) Namespaces\" registry\
    \ available from\n   the IANA site (http://www.iana.org) and any associated mirrors.\n"
- title: 7.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "7.  Security Considerations\n   There are no additional security considerations\
    \ other than those\n   normally associated with the use and resolution of URNs\
    \ in general,\n   which are described in [RFC1737], [RFC2141], and [RFC3406].\n"
