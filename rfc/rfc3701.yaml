  - "Abstract\n   The 6bone was established in 1996 by the IETF as an IPv6 Testbed\n\
    \   network to enable various IPv6 testing as well as to assist in the\n   transitioning\
    \ of IPv6 into the Internet.  It operates under the IPv6\n   address allocation\
    \ 3FFE::/16 from RFC 2471.  As IPv6 is beginning its\n   production deployment\
    \ it is appropriate to plan for the phaseout of\n   the 6bone.  This document\
    \ establishes a plan for a multi-year\n   phaseout of the 6bone and its address\
    \ allocation on the assumption\n   that the IETF is the appropriate place to determine\
    \ this.\n   This document obsoletes RFC 2471, \"IPv6 Testing Address Allocation\"\
    ,\n   December, 1998.  RFC 2471 will become historic.\n"
- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   The 6bone IPv6 Testbed network was established in March\
    \ 1996,\n   becoming operational during the summer of 1996 using an IPv6 testing\n\
    \   address allocation of 5F00::/8 [TEST-OLD] that used the original (and\n  \
    \ now obsolete) provider based unicast address format.  In July 1998, a\n   new\
    \ IPv6 Addressing Architecture [ARCH] replaced the original\n   provider based\
    \ unicast address format with the now standardized\n   Aggregatable Global Unicast\
    \ Address Format [AGGR].\n   To allow the 6bone to operate under the revised IPv6\
    \ address\n   architecture with the new Aggregatable Global Unicast addressing\n\
    \   format, [TEST-OLD] was replaced with a new IPv6 testing address\n   allocation\"\
    \ of 3FFE::/16 in [TEST-NEW].  During the fall of 1998, in\n   anticipation of\
    \ [AGGR], the 6bone was re-addressed under the\n   3FFE::/16 prefix with little\
    \ problems.\n   From the fall of 1998, until the issuance of this note, the 6bone\
    \ has\n   continued to successfully operate with Aggregatable Global Unicast\n\
    \   Address prefixes from the 3FFE::/16 allocation, using a set of 6bone\n   routing\
    \ practice rules specified in [GUIDE], and later refined to\n   6Bone backbone\
    \ routing guidelines in [PRACTICE].\n   During its lifetime the 6bone has provided:\n\
    \      - a place for early standard developers and implementers to test\n    \
    \    out the IPv6 protocols and their implementations;\n      - a place for early\
    \ experimentation with routing and operational\n        procedures;\n      - a\
    \ place to evolve practices useful for production IPv6 prefix\n        allocation;\n\
    \      - a place to provide bootstrap qualification for production IPv6\n    \
    \    address prefix allocation;\n      - a place to develop IPv6 applications;\n\
    \      - a place for early users to try using IPv6 in their hosts and\n      \
    \  networks.\n   As clearly stated in [TEST-NEW], the addresses for the 6bone\
    \ are\n   temporary and will be reclaimed in the future.  It further states\n\
    \   that all users of these addresses (within the 3FFE::/16 prefix) will\n   be\
    \ required to renumber at some time in the future.\n   Since 1999 planning for,\
    \ and allocation of, IPv6 production address\n   prefixes by the Regional Internet\
    \ Registry (RIR) community has been\n   underway.  During 2002 more production\
    \ IPv6 address prefixes had been\n   allocated than are allocated by the 6bone\
    \ at the top level.  It is\n   generally assumed that this is one reasonable indicator\
    \ that planning\n   for a 6bone phaseout should begin.\n   It is generally assumed\
    \ that there is still some remaining need for\n   the 6bone, at least for current\
    \ usage that will take time to evaluate\n   and possibly move to production IPv6\
    \ networks when possible.\n   It is generally viewed that the 6bone is an IETF\
    \ activity as it was\n   established by IETF participants to assist the IETF in\
    \ developing\n   IPv6 protocols, and also to assist in the IPv6 transition.  To\
    \ this\n   end, the [TEST-NEW] RFC specified that the 6bone testing was to be\n\
    \   under the auspices of the IETF IPng Transition (ngtrans) Working\n   Group\
    \ 6bone testbed activity.  However, during 2002 the ngtrans\n   working group\
    \ was terminated and replaced to a certain degree by the\n   v6ops working group,\
    \ which did not include oversight of the 6bone in\n   its charter.  Therefore\
    \ it is assumed that it is appropriate to use\n   the IETF Informational RFC process\
    \ to determine a 6bone phaseout\n   plan, as well as an appropriate way to get\
    \ community feedback on the\n   specifics of the 6bone phaseout.\n   This plan\
    \ for a 6bone phaseout specifies a multi-year phaseout\n   timeline to allow sufficient\
    \ time for continuing operation of the\n   6bone, followed by a sufficient time\
    \ for 6bone participants to\n   convert to production IPv6 address prefixes allocated\
    \ by the relevant\n   Regional Internet Registry (RIR), National Internet Registry,\
    \ or\n   Local Internet Registries (ISPs).\n   It is anticipated that under this\
    \ phaseout plan the 6bone will cease\n   to operate by June 6, 2006, with all\
    \ 6bone prefixes fully reclaimed\n   by the IANA.\n   This document obsoletes\
    \ RFC 2471, \"IPv6 Testing Address Allocation\",\n   December, 1998.  RFC 2471\
    \ will become historic.\n   The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\"\
    , \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"\
    MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n   document are to be interpreted as described\
    \ in [RFC2119].\n"
- title: 2.  6bone Phaseout Plan
  contents:
  - "2.  6bone Phaseout Plan\n   To provide for the continuing useful operation of\
    \ the 6bone, to the\n   extent that IETF consensus judges it to be useful, 6bone\
    \ top level\n   address prefixes known as pseudo TLA's (pTLAs) MAY continue to\
    \ be\n   allocated until January 1, 2004.\n   Thus after the pTLA allocation cutoff\
    \ date January 1, 2004, it is\n   REQUIRED that no new 6bone 3FFE pTLAs be allocated.\n\
    \   To provide for sufficient planning time for 6bone participants to\n   convert\
    \ to production IPv6 address prefixes, all 6bone prefixes\n   allocated by the\
    \ cutoff time specified above, except for allocations\n   withdrawn as a matter\
    \ of 6bone operating procedures, SHALL remain\n   valid until June 6, 2006.\n\
    \   Thus after the 6bone phaseout date June 6, 2006, it is the intent\n   that\
    \ no 6bone 3FFE prefixes, of any size/length, be used on the\n   Internet in any\
    \ form.  Network operators may filter 3FFE prefixes on\n   their borders to ensure\
    \ these prefixes are not misused.\n   It should be noted that this RFC does not\
    \ intend to imply that a\n   6bone prefix holder, whether at the pTLA top level\
    \ or lower, should\n   seek a production IPv6 address prefix at any specific level.\
    \  It may\n   be entirely reasonable for a 6bone prefix holder to seek a higher\n\
    \   level, or a lower level, IPv6 prefix as their specific needs dictate.\n"

    \ 6bone Testing Address Allocation is reclaimed by the IANA,\n   it is expected\
    \ that many network operators will filter it on their\n   borders to ensure these\
    \ prefixes are not misused.\n   There is experience from the IPv4 world that such\
    \ filters may not be\n   removed promptly should this address space be reallocated,\
    \ and it is\n   recommended that the IANA bears this in mind before reallocating\
