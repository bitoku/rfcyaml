  contents:
  - "1.1.  Overview\n   A number of technologies and applications provide the ability\
    \ for a\n   person to choose a memorable, human-friendly name in a communications\n\
    \   context, or to set such a name for another entity such as a device,\n   account,\
    \ contact, or website.  Such names are variously called\n   \"nicknames\" (e.g.,\
    \ in chat room applications), \"display names\" (e.g.,\n   in Internet mail),\
    \ or \"petnames\" (see [PETNAME-SYSTEMS]); for\n   consistency, these are all\
    \ called \"nicknames\" in this document.\n   Nicknames are commonly supported\
    \ in technologies for textual chat\n   rooms, e.g., Internet Relay Chat [RFC2811]\
    \ and multi-party chat\n   technologies based on the Extensible Messaging and\
    \ Presence Protocol\n   (XMPP) [RFC6120] [XEP-0045], the Message Session Relay\
    \ Protocol\n   (MSRP) [RFC4975] [RFC7701], and Centralized Conferencing (XCON)\n\
    \   [RFC5239] [XCON-SYSTEM].  Recent chat room technologies also allow\n   internationalized\
    \ nicknames because they support characters from\n   outside the ASCII range [RFC20],\
    \ typically by means of the Unicode\n   character set [Unicode].  Although such\
    \ nicknames tend to be used\n   primarily for display purposes, they are sometimes\
    \ used for\n   programmatic purposes as well (e.g., kicking users or avoiding\n\
    \   nickname conflicts).\n   A similar usage enables a person to set their own\
    \ preferred display\n   name or to set a preferred display name for another user\
    \ (e.g., the\n   \"display-name\" construct in the Internet message format [RFC5322]\
    \ and\n   [XEP-0172] in XMPP).\n   Memorable, human-friendly names are also used\
    \ in contexts other than\n   personal messaging, such as names for devices (e.g.,\
    \ in a network\n   visualization application), websites (e.g., for bookmarks in\
    \ a web\n   browser), accounts (e.g., in a web interface for a list of payees\
    \ in\n   a bank account), people (e.g., in a contact list application), and\n\
    \   the like.\n   The rules specified in this document can be applied in all of\
    \ the\n   foregoing contexts.\n   To increase the likelihood that memorable, human-friendly\
    \ names will\n   work in ways that make sense for typical users throughout the\
    \ world,\n   this document defines rules for preparing, enforcing, and comparing\n\
    \   internationalized nicknames.\n"
- title: 1.2.  Terminology
  contents:
  - "1.2.  Terminology\n   Many important terms used in this document are defined\
    \ in [RFC7564],\n   [RFC6365], and [Unicode].\n   The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST\
    \ NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\"\
    , \"RECOMMENDED\", \"NOT RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and\n   \"OPTIONAL\" in this\
    \ document are to be interpreted as described in\n   [RFC2119].\n"

- title: 2.1.  Rules
  contents:
  - "2.1.  Rules\n   The following rules apply within the Nickname profile of the\
    \ PRECIS\n   FreeformClass.\n   1.  Width Mapping Rule: There is no width-mapping\
    \ rule (such a rule\n       is not necessary because width mapping is performed\
    \ as part of\n       normalization using Normalization Form KC (NFKC) as specified\n\
    \       below).\n   2.  Additional Mapping Rule: The additional mapping rule consists\
    \ of\n       the following sub-rules.\n       1.  Any instances of non-ASCII space\
    \ MUST be mapped to ASCII\n           space (U+0020); a non-ASCII space is any\
    \ Unicode code point\n           having a general category of \"Zs\", naturally\
    \ with the\n           exception of U+0020.\n       2.  Any instances of the ASCII\
    \ space character at the beginning\n           or end of a nickname MUST be removed\
    \ (e.g., \"stpeter \" is\n           mapped to \"stpeter\").\n       3.  Interior\
    \ sequences of more than one ASCII space character\n           MUST be mapped\
    \ to a single ASCII space character (e.g.,\n           \"St  Peter\" is mapped\
    \ to \"St Peter\").\n   3.  Case Mapping Rule: Unicode Default Case Folding MUST\
    \ be applied,\n       as defined in the Unicode Standard [Unicode] (at the time\
    \ of this\n       writing, the algorithm is specified in Chapter 3 of\n      \
    \ [Unicode7.0]).  In applications that prohibit conflicting\n       nicknames,\
    \ this rule helps to reduce the possibility of confusion\n       by ensuring that\
    \ nicknames differing only by case (e.g.,\n       \"stpeter\" vs. \"StPeter\"\
    ) would not be presented to a human user\n       at the same time.\n   4.  Normalization\
    \ Rule: The string MUST be normalized using Unicode\n       NFKC.  Because NFKC\
    \ is more \"aggressive\" in finding matches than\n       other normalization forms\
    \ (in the terminology of Unicode, it\n       performs both canonical and compatibility\
    \ decomposition before\n       recomposing code points), this rule helps to reduce\
    \ the\n       possibility of confusion by increasing the number of characters\n\
    \       that would match (e.g., U+2163 ROMAN NUMERAL FOUR would match the\n  \
    \     combination of U+0049 LATIN CAPITAL LETTER I and U+0056 LATIN\n       CAPITAL\
    \ LETTER V).\n   5.  Directionality Rule: There is no directionality rule.  The\
    \ \"Bidi\n       Rule\" (defined in [RFC5893]) and similar rules are unnecessary\n\
    \       and inapplicable to nicknames, because it is perfectly acceptable\n  \
    \     for a given nickname to be presented differently in different\n       layout\
    \ systems (e.g., a user interface that is configured to\n       handle primarily\
    \ a right-to-left script versus an interface that\n       is configured to handle\
    \ primarily a left-to-right script), as\n       long as the presentation is consistent\
    \ in any given layout\n       system.\n"
- title: 2.2.  Preparation
  contents:
  - "2.2.  Preparation\n   An entity that prepares a string for subsequent enforcement\
    \ according\n   to this profile MUST ensure that the string consists only of Unicode\n\
    \   code points that conform to the FreeformClass string class defined in\n  \
    \ [RFC7564].  In addition, the entity MUST ensure that the string is\n   encoded\
    \ as UTF-8 [RFC3629].\n"
- title: 2.3.  Enforcement
  contents:
  - "2.3.  Enforcement\n   An entity that performs enforcement according to this profile\
    \ MUST\n   prepare a string as described in Section 2.2 and MUST also apply the\n\
    \   following rules specified in Section 2.1 in the order shown:\n   1.  Additional\
    \ Mapping Rule\n   2.  Normalization Rule\n   3.  Directionality Rule\n   After\
    \ all of the foregoing rules have been enforced, the entity MUST\n   ensure that\
    \ the nickname is not zero bytes in length (this is done\n   after enforcing the\
    \ rules to prevent applications from mistakenly\n   omitting a nickname entirely,\
    \ because when internationalized\n   characters are accepted, a non-empty sequence\
    \ of characters can\n   result in a zero-length nickname after canonicalization).\n"
- title: 2.4.  Comparison
  contents:
  - "2.4.  Comparison\n   An entity that performs comparison of two strings according\
    \ to this\n   profile MUST prepare each string as specified in Section 2.2 and\
    \ MUST\n   apply the following rules specified in Section 2.1 in the order\n \
    \  shown:\n   1.  Additional Mapping Rule\n   2.  Case Mapping Rule\n   3.  Normalization\
    \ Rule\n   4.  Directionality Rule\n   The two strings are to be considered equivalent\
    \ if they are an exact\n   octet-for-octet match (sometimes called \"bit-string\
    \ identity\").\n"
- title: 3.  Examples
  contents:
  - "3.  Examples\n   The following examples illustrate a small number of nicknames\
    \ that\n   are consistent with the format defined above, along with the output\n\
    \   string resulting from application of the PRECIS rules (note that the\n   characters\
    \ < and > are used to delineate the actual nickname and are\n   not part of the\
    \ nickname strings).\n   Table 1: A Sample of Legal Nicknames\n   +---------------------------+-----------------------------------+\n\
    \   | # | Nickname              | Output for Comparison             |\n   +---------------------------+-----------------------------------+\n\

    \   | 9 | <Richard &#x2163;>    | <richard iv>                      |\n   +---------------------------+-----------------------------------+\n\
    \   Regarding examples 5, 6, and 7: applying Unicode Default Case Folding\n  \
    \ to GREEK CAPITAL LETTER SIGMA (U+03A3) results in GREEK SMALL LETTER\n   SIGMA\
    \ (U+03C3), and the same is true of GREEK SMALL LETTER FINAL\n   SIGMA (U+03C2);\
    \ therefore, the comparison operation defined in\n   Section 2.4 would result\
    \ in matching of the nicknames in examples 5,\n   6, and 7.  Regarding example\
    \ 8: symbol characters such as BLACK CHESS\n   KING (U+265A) are allowed by the\
    \ PRECIS FreeformClass and thus can be\n   used in nicknames.  Regarding example\
    \ 9: applying Unicode Default\n   Case Folding to ROMAN NUMERAL FOUR (U+2163)\
    \ results in SMALL ROMAN\n   NUMERAL FOUR (U+2173), and applying NFKC to SMALL\
    \ ROMAN NUMERAL FOUR\n   (U+2173) results in LATIN SMALL LETTER I (U+0069) LATIN\
    \ SMALL LETTER\n   V (U+0086).\n"
- title: 4.  Use in Application Protocols
  contents:
  - "4.  Use in Application Protocols\n   This specification defines only the PRECIS-based\
    \ rules for handling\n   of nickname strings.  It is the responsibility of an\
    \ application\n   protocol (e.g., MSRP, XCON, or XMPP) or application definition\
    \ to\n   specify the protocol slots in which nickname strings can appear, the\n\
    \   entities that are expected to enforce the rules governing nickname\n   strings,\
    \ and when in protocol processing or interface handling the\n   rules need to\
    \ be enforced.  See Section 6 of [RFC7564] for guidelines\n   about using PRECIS\
    \ profiles in applications.\n   Above and beyond the PRECIS-based rules specified\
    \ here, application\n   protocols can also define application-specific rules governing\n\
    \   nickname strings (rules regarding the minimum or maximum length of\n   nicknames,\
    \ further restrictions on allowable characters or character\n   ranges, safeguards\
    \ to mitigate the effects of visually similar\n   characters, etc.).\n   Naturally,\
    \ application protocols can also specify rules governing the\n   actual use of\
    \ nicknames in applications (reserved nicknames,\n   authorization requirements\
    \ for using nicknames, whether certain\n   nicknames can be prohibited, handling\
    \ of duplicates, the relationship\n   between nicknames and underlying identifiers\
    \ such as SIP URIs or\n   Jabber IDs, etc.).\n   Entities that enforce the rules\
    \ specified in this document are\n   encouraged to be liberal in what they accept\
    \ by following this\n   procedure:\n   1.  Where possible, map characters (e.g,\
    \ through width mapping,\n       additional mapping, case mapping, or normalization)\
    \ and accept\n       the mapped string.\n   2.  If mapping is not possible (e.g.,\
    \ because a character is\n       disallowed in the FreeformClass), reject the\
    \ string.\n"
