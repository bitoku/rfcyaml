Abstract This document provides information about character encoding KOI8 U (KOI8 Ukrainian)
wich is a de facto standard in Ukrainian Internet community.
KOI8 U is compatible with KOI8 R (RFC 1489) in all Russian letters and extends it with four Ukrainian letters which locations are compliant with ISO IR 111.
The official site of KOI8 U Working Group is http://www.net.ua.
This document provides information about character encoding KOI8 U (KOI8 Ukrainian) widely used in Ukrainian Internet community for mail and news exchange as well as for presentation of WWW information resources in Ukrainian language.
Originally, specification of proposed standard koi8 u was officially adopted by the conference of Postmasters of Ukrainian Internet Service Providers in Slavsk in Autumn of 1992 presented by Igor Sviridov from Kiev and Stas Vorony from Kharkiv.
Later in June 1995 this specification was completed with UKRAINIAN GHE WITH UPTURN.
KOI8 U (KOI8 Ukrainian) is a de facto standard supported in many operation systems and Internet user applications including encoding tables, fonts, locale support for many operating systems and environments.
koi8 u Relation to other RFCs
This standard is based on several published standards:  RFC1489 (it is fully compatible in all Russian letters), RFC 1345, ISO IR 111, ISO 10646.
Compatibility with other character sets The lower part of the KOI8 U Ukrainian Character Set is a complete copy of ASCII, just as it's used in KOI8 R and other non ASCII codepages.
The upper part of the KOI8 U Character Set contains all Russian letters defined in KOI8 R and four Ukrainian letters (#164, #180 ukr.
ghe  with upturn) which locations are compliant with ISO IR 111.
BOX DRAWINGS elements in the other positions (that are not used by Ukrainian letters) are the same as in KOI8 R character set.
List of all differences between KOI8 R and proposed KOI8 U is given in APPENDIX A. Specification of the upper part of KOI8 U codepage The description of all characters of upper half part of KOI8 U codepage is given according to ISO 10646 Unicode Character Set (UCS).
KOI8 U charset table in RFC1345 format is given in Appendix B. <decimal>  <hex code>
