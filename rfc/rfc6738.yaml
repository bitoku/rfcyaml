- title: Abstract
  contents:
  - "Abstract\n   The Internet Key Exchange Protocol version 2 (IKEv2) is a component\n\
    \   of the IPsec architecture and is used to perform mutual\n   authentication\
    \ as well as to establish and to maintain IPsec Security\n   Associations (SAs)\
    \ between the respective parties.  IKEv2 supports\n   several different authentication\
    \ mechanisms, such as the Extensible\n   Authentication Protocol (EAP), certificates,\
    \ and Shared Key (SK).\n   Diameter interworking for Mobile IPv6 between the Home\
    \ Agent (HA), as\n   a Diameter client, and the Diameter server has been specified.\n\
    \   However, that specification focused on the usage of EAP and did not\n   include\
    \ support for SK-based authentication available with IKEv2.\n   This document\
    \ specifies the IKEv2-server-to-Diameter-server\n   communication when the IKEv2\
    \ peer authenticates using IKEv2 with SK.\n"

  - "1.  Introduction\n   The Internet Key Exchange Protocol version 2 (IKEv2) [RFC5996]\
    \ is\n   used to mutually authenticate two parities and to establish a\n   Security\
    \ Association (SA) that can be used to efficiently secure the\n   communication\
    \ between the IKEv2 peer and server, for example, using\n   Encapsulating Security\
    \ Payload (ESP) [RFC4303] and/or Authentication\n   Header (AH) [RFC4302].  The\
    \ IKEv2 protocol allows several different\n   mechanisms for authenticating an\
    \ IKEv2 peer to be used, such as the\n   Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP),\
    \ certificates, and SK.\n   From a service provider perspective, it is important\
    \ to ensure that a\n   user is authorized to use the services.  Therefore, the\
    \ IKEv2 server\n   must verify that the IKEv2 peer is authorized for the requested\n\
    \   services, possibly with the assistance of the operator's Diameter\n   servers.\
    \  [RFC5778] defines the home agent as a Diameter-client-to-\n   Diameter-server\
    \ communication when the mobile node authenticates\n   using the IKEv2 protocol\
    \ with the Extensible Authentication Protocol\n   (EAP) [RFC3748] or using the\
    \ Mobile IPv6 Authentication Protocol\n   [RFC4285].  This document specifies\
    \ the IKEv2-server-to-Diameter-\n   server communication when the IKEv2 peer authenticates\
    \ using IKEv2\n   with SK.\n   Figure 1 depicts the reference architecture for\
    \ this document.\n                                       +--------+\n        \

    \           Figure 1: Architecture Overview\n   An example use case for this architecture\
    \ is Mobile IPv6 deployment\n   in which the Mobile IPv6 signaling between the\
    \ Mobile Node and the\n   Home Agent is protected using IPsec.  The Mobile node\
    \ acts as the\n   IKEv2 peer and the Home Agent acts as an IKEv2 server.  In this\
    \ use\n   case, IKEv2 with SK-based initiator authentication is used for the\n\
    \   setup of the IPsec SAs.  The HA obtains the SK using the Diameter\n   application\
    \ specified in this document.\n   This document assumes that the SK provided to\
    \ the IKEv2 peer as well\n   as the SK delivered to the IKEv2 server by the Diameter\
    \ server are\n   established or derived using the same rules.  Furthermore, it\
    \ assumes\n   that these rules are agreed to by the external protocol on a peer\n\
    \   side providing the key to the IKEv2 peer, and on the Diameter server\n   side\
    \ providing the key to the IKEv2 server.  This document allows for\n   the SK\
    \ to be obtained for a specific IKEv2 session and exchanged\n   between IKEv2\
    \ server and the Home Authentication, Authorization, and\n   Accounting (HAAA)\
    \ server.  The protocol provides IKEv2 attributes to\n   allow the HAAA to compute\
    \ the SK specific to the session if desired\n   (see Section 10).  This is accomplished\
    \ through the use of a new\n   Diameter application specifically designed for\
    \ performing IKEv2\n   authorization decisions.  This document focuses on the\
    \ IKEv2 server,\n   as a Diameter client, communicating to the Diameter server,\
    \ and it\n   specifies the Diameter application needed for this communication.\n\
    \   Other protocols leveraging this Diameter application MAY specify\n   their\
    \ own SK derivation scheme.  For example see [X.S0047] and\n   [X.S0058].  This\
    \ document specifies the default procedure for\n   derivation of the SK used in\
    \ IKEv2 authentication when protocols\n   leveraging this Diameter application\
    \ do not specify their own\n   derivation procedure.  Selection of either default\
    \ or other SK\n   derivation procedure is done by the external protocol between\
    \ the\n   Peer and the Diameter Server, and is outside the scope of this\n   document.\n"

  contents:
  - "4.1.  Support for IKEv2 and Shared Keys\n   When IKEv2 is used with SK-based\
    \ initiator authentication, the\n   Diameter commands IKEv2-SK-Request/Answer\
    \ defined in this document\n   are used between the IKEv2 server and a Home AAA\
    \ (HAAA) server to\n   authorize the IKEv2 peer for the services.  Upon receiving\
    \ the\n   IKE_AUTH message from the IKEv2 peer, the IKEv2 server uses the\n  \
    \ information received in IDi [RFC5996] to identify the IKEv2 peer and\n   the\
    \ SPI, if available, to determine the correct SK for this IKEv2\n   peer.  If\
    \ no SK associated with this IKEv2 peer is found, the IKEv2\n   server MUST send\
    \ an Authorize-Only (Auth-Request-Type set to\n   \"Authorize-Only\") Diameter\
    \ IKEv2-SK-Request message to the HAAA to\n   obtain the SK.  If the IDi payload\
    \ extracted from the IKE_AUTH\n   message contains an identity that is meaningful\
    \ for the Diameter\n   infrastructure, such as a Network Access Identifier (NAI),\
    \ it SHALL\n   be used by the IKEv2 server to populate the User-Name AVP in the\n\
    \   Diameter message.  Otherwise, it is out of scope of this document how\n  \
    \ the IKEv2 server maps the value received in the IDi payload to the\n   User-Name\
    \ AVP and whether or not the User-Name AVP is included in the\n   IKEv2-SK-Request\
    \ message.  In the same Diameter message, the IKEv2\n   server SHALL also include\
    \ the IKEv2-Nonces AVP with the initiator and\n   responder nonces (Ni and Nr)\
    \ exchanged during initial IKEv2 exchange.\n   Finally, the IKEv2 server SHALL\
    \ include the IKEv2-Identity AVP in the\n   IKEv2-SK-Request message.  The Initiator-Identity\
    \ AVP SHALL be\n   populated with the IDi field extracted from the IKE_AUTH message.\
    \  If\n   the IDr payload was included in the IKE_AUTH message received from\n\
    \   the IKEv2 peer, the IKEv2 server SHALL also include a Responder-\n   Identity\
    \ AVP populated with the received IDr.\n   The IKEv2 server sends the IKEv2-SK-Request\
    \ message to the IKEv2\n   peer's HAAA.  The Diameter message is routed to the\
    \ correct HAAA per\n   [RFC6733].\n   Upon receiving a Diameter IKEv2-SK-Request\
    \ message from the IKEv2\n   server, the HAAA SHALL use the User-Name AVP (if\
    \ present) and/or\n   Initiator-Identity AVP to retrieve the associated keying\
    \ material.\n   When the default SK-generation procedure specified in this document\n\
    \   is used, the peer side that provides the SK to the IKEv2 peer, as\n   well\
    \ as the Diameter server, SHALL use the same SK derivation that\n   follows the\
    \ methodology similar to that specified in Section 3.1 of\n   [RFC5295], specifically:\n\
    \   SK = KDF(PSK, key label | \"\\0\" | Ni | Nr | IDi | length)\n   Where:\n \
    \  o  KDF is the default key derivation function based on HMAC-SHA-256\n     \
    \ as specified in Section 3.1.2 of [RFC5295].\n   o  Pre-Shared Key (PSK) is the\
    \ key available to the protocol\n      leveraging this Diameter application, e.g.,\
    \ the long-term shared\n      secret, or the Extended Master Session Key (EMSK)\
    \ as the result of\n      prior EAP authentication, etc.  Selection of this value\
    \ is left up\n      to the protocol leveraging this Diameter application.\n  \
    \ o  Key label is set to 'sk4ikev2@ietf.org'.\n   o  | denotes concatenation\n\
    \   o  \"\\0\" is a NULL octet (0x00 in hex)\n   o  Length is a 2-octet unsigned\
    \ integer in network byte order of the\n      output key length, in octets.\n\
    \   When applications using this protocol define their own SK-generation\n   algorithm,\
    \ it is strongly RECOMMENDED that the nonces Ni and Nr be\n   used in the computation.\
    \  It is also RECOMMENDED that IDi be used.\n   IDr SHOULD NOT be used in the\
    \ SK generation algorithm.  Applications\n   that want to use IDr in the computation\
    \ should take into\n   consideration that the IDr asserted by the IKEv2 peer may\
    \ not be the\n   same as the IDr returned by the IKEv2 responder.  This mismatch\
    \ will\n   result in different SKs being generated.  The HAAA returns the SK to\n\
    \   the IKEv2 server using the Key AVP as specified in [RFC6734].\n   Once the\
    \ IKEv2 server receives the SK from the HAAA, the IKEv2 server\n   verifies the\
    \ IKE_AUTH message received from the IKEv2 peer.  If the\n   verification of AUTH\
    \ is successful, the IKEv2 server sends the IKE\n   message back to the IKEv2\
    \ peer.\n"

- title: 10.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "10.  Security Considerations\n   The security considerations of the Diameter\
    \ base protocol [RFC6733]\n   are applicable to this document (e.g., it is expected\
    \ that Diameter\n   protocol is used with security mechanism and that Diameter\
    \ messages\n   are secured).\n   In addition, the assumption is that the IKEv2\
    \ server and the Diameter\n   server, where the SK is generated, are in a trusted\
    \ relationship.\n   Hence, the assumption is that there is an appropriate security\n\
    \   mechanism to protect the communication between these servers.  For\n   example,\
    \ the IKEv2 server and the Diameter server would be deployed\n   in the same secure\
    \ network or would utilize transport-layer security\n   as specified in [RFC6733].\n\
    \   The Diameter messages between the IKEv2 server and the HAAA may be\n   transported\
    \ via one or more AAA brokers or Diameter agents.  In this\n   case, the IKEv2\
    \ server to the Diameter server AAA communication is\n   hop-by-hop protected;\
    \ hence, it relies on the security properties of\n   the intermediating AAA inter-connection\
    \ networks, AAA brokers, and\n   Diameter agents.  Furthermore, any agents that\
    \ process IKEv2-SK-\n   Answer messages can see the contents of the Key AVP.\n\
    \   To mitigate the threat of exposing a long-lived PSK, this\n   specification\
    \ expects that the HAAA derive and return the associated\n   SK to the IKEv2 server.\
    \  Given that SK derivation is security-\n   critical, for the SK derivation,\
    \ this specification recommends the\n   use of short-lived secrets, possibly based\
    \ on a previous network\n   access authentication, if such secrets are available.\
    \  To ensure key\n   freshness and to limit the key scope, this specification\
    \ strongly\n   recommends the use of nonces included in the IKEv2-SK-Request.\
    \  The\n   specifics of key derivation depend on the security characteristics\
    \ of\n   the system that is leveraging this specification (for example, see\n\
    \   [X.S0047] and [X.S0058]); therefore, this specification does not\n   define\
    \ how the Diameter server derives required keys for these\n   systems.  For systems\
    \ and protocols that leverage this Diameter\n   application but do not specify\
    \ the key derivation procedure, this\n   document specifies the default key derivation\
    \ procedure that\n   preserves expected security characteristics.\n"
