- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   ucode [UCODE] is an identifier to be stored in many types\
    \ of tags\n   (not limited to Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) tags).  Its\n\
    \   allocation and management is handled by the Ubiquitous ID Center\n   [UIDC].\
    \  The embedding of ucode in many types of tags (RFID tags,\n   optical code,\
    \ infrared markers, and even sound source) is also\n   specified by the Ubiquitous\
    \ ID Center.\n   The basic length of ucode is 128 bits, but it is extensible in\
    \ units\n   of 128 bits if necessary.\n   ucode has been devised to identify objects\
    \ and places where existing\n   standards do not fit the application needs or\
    \ the scope of the\n   applications or where the allocation policy of existing\
    \ standards is\n   too limited for Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs), small-scale\n\
    \   research laboratories at academic institutions, or individual users.\n   Applications\
    \ that use ucode take advantage of the Internet\n   extensively.  Use of ucode\
    \ is open to anybody.  Those who wish to\n   have ucode allocated can do so either\
    \ by having ucode subspace\n   allocated to them directly from the Ubiquitous\
    \ ID Center [UIDC] or by\n   obtaining tags that have pre-stored ucode from so\
    \ called \"providers\"\n   [UCDMIP].  Such tags are certified as ucode tags [UIDTAG],\
    \ and the\n   reader specifications are published so that there will be many\n\
    \   readers available for such tags.\n   By having a URN for ucode, we can facilitate\
    \ the use of ucode in many\n   Internet-related devices and software for the benefit\
    \ of existing and\n   future users of ucode and people who will access such tags\
    \ attached\n   to objects and places.  Since an application based on ucode can\
    \ run\n   across organizational boundaries and spread across regions and\n   countries,\
    \ a formal URN Namespace Identifier (NID) assignment for\n   'ucode' is requested.\n"
- title: 2.  'ucode' Registration Template
  contents:
  - "2.  'ucode' Registration Template\n   Namespace ID:\n   'ucode' requested\n \
    \  Registration Information:\n   Registration Version Number: 1\n   Registration\
    \ Date: 2011-12-21\n   Declared registrant of the namespace:\n   T-Engine Forum\n\
    \   2-20-1, Nishi-Gotanda\n   Shinagawa, Tokyo, 141-0031\n   Japan\n   office@t-engine.org\n\
    \   Tel: +81-3-5437-0572\n   Declaration of syntactic structure:\n   The structure\
    \ of the namespace for 'ucode' using the hexadecimal\n   representation of the\
    \ identifier is as follows using ABNF [RFC5234].\n   UCODE-URN = \"urn:ucode:\"\
    \ ucode-name\n   ucode-name = \"_\" ucode-number\n   ucode-number = 1*ucode-value\n\
    \   ucode-value = 32HEXDIG\n   HEXDIG         =  DIGIT / \"A\" / \"B\" / \"C\"\
    \ / \"D\" / \"E\" / \"F\"\n   DIGIT          =  %x30-39\n                  ; 0-9\n\
    \   NOTE 1:  \"1*\" at the start of the ucode-number definition is not a\n   typo.\
    \  Although the currently used ucode [UCODE] is 128 bits (16\n   octets), thus\
    \ requiring 32 hexadecimal characters to represent\n   serially, ucode is designed\
    \ to be extensible in increments of 128\n   bits.  So, in the distant future,\
    \ we may need to repeat the chunks of\n   128 bits.  This is why \"1*\" precedes\
    \ ucode-value.\n   NOTE 2:  ucode-name starts with a \"_\" because it is also\
    \ intended to\n   be used as an identifier for XML [W3CXML].  Because an XML tag\
    \ can't\n   start with a digit, an \"_\" (underscore) is inserted at the beginning\n\
    \   to make sure ucode-name starts with a non-digit.  For example, the\n   128-bit\
    \ ucode value 0123456789ABCDEF0123456789ABCDEF, expressed in a\n   series of hexadecimal\
    \ digits, is as follows:\n   urn:ucode:_0123456789ABCDEF0123456789ABCDEF\n   Relevant\
    \ ancillary documentation:\n   ucode, the identifier expressed by ucode-number,\
    \ is managed by the\n   Ubiquitous ID Center [UIDC], which is a sub-organization\
    \ of the\n   T-Engine Forum [TEF].  The document \"Ubiquitous Code: ucode\" [UCODE]\n\
    \   defines this identifier system.\n   Identifier uniqueness considerations:\n\
    \   The 'ucode' namespace is managed by the Ubiquitous ID Center.  The\n   Ubiquitous\
    \ ID Center assigns the identifier, ucode, in such a way\n   that the uniqueness\
    \ of the 'ucode' namespace will be maintained.\n   Identifier persistence considerations:\n\
    \   The assignment process guarantees that names are not reassigned and\n   that\
    \ the binding between the name and its resource is permanent,\n   regardless of\
    \ any standards or organizational changes or the\n   assignment period.\n   Process\
    \ of identifier assignment:\n   Names are assigned by the Ubiquitous ID Center\
    \ and by any entities\n   that are sub-delegated by the Ubiquitous ID Center.\
    \  This assignment\n   process is based on \"ucode Management Implementing Procedures\"\
    \n   [UCDMIP] established by the Ubiquitous ID Center.\n   Process of identifier\
    \ resolution:\n   The process of identifier resolution is currently based on the\
    \ \"ucode\n   Resolution Protocol\" [UCSURP].  It will be enhanced by using newer\n\
    \   recommendations from ITU-T and/or standards from ISO.\n   Rules for lexical\
    \ equivalence:\n   The entire UCODE-URN is case-sensitive.\n   NOTE: This is an\
    \ additional restriction imposed on the ucode\n   namespace by the requirements\
    \ of some major applications of ucode in\n   existence.  Only capital \"A\", \"\
    B\", \"C\", ..., \"F\" are allowed as part\n   of hexadecimal characters.\n  \
    \ Conformance with URN syntax:\n   There are no special reserved characters. \
    \ The URN of this namespace\n   conforms to RFC 2141 [RFC2141] and RFC 3986 [RFC3986].\n\
    \   Validation mechanism:\n   No special considerations.\n   Scope:\n   Global.\n"

- title: 4.  Namespace Considerations
  contents:
  - "4.  Namespace Considerations\n   ucode, the identifier expressed by ucode-number,\
    \ is a unique\n   identification number to identify a tangible object or a place.\n\
    \   Additionally, ucode can be assigned to \"content\" or \"information\"\n  \
    \ that does not exist in the real world or a \"concept\" that is yet more\n  \
    \ abstract.\n   ucode has been devised to identify objects and places where existing\n\
    \   standards do not fit the application needs or the scope of the\n   applications\
    \ or where the allocation policy of existing standards is\n   too limited for\
    \ SMEs, small-scale research laboratories at academic\n   institutions, or individual\
    \ users.\n   ucode is only an identification number, and its value (or its sub-\n\
    \   bitfields) does not contain any pre-assigned meaning.  Any relevant\n   information\
    \ about the object or place to which a ucode is assigned is\n   stored in a data\
    \ server that can be reached after a \"resolution\n   process\" [UCSURP].  This\
    \ resolution process usually occurs over the\n   Internet.\n   ucode can be assigned\
    \ to an object to be identified regardless of the\n   type of application.  ucode\
    \ is expected to be stored in any kind of\n   tags (2D optical code, RFID, etc.),\
    \ and it provides a framework where\n   anyone can obtain unique numbers for identification\
    \ purposes.\n   ucode has been designed to provide the services outlined in ITU-T\n\
    \   Recommendation F.771 [ITU-T-F771] and to operate in the framework of\n   ITU-T\
    \ Recommendation H.621 [ITU-T-H621].\n   ucode architecture is general enough\
    \ to cover many applications for\n   the users.\n"
- title: 5.  Community Considerations
  contents:
  - "5.  Community Considerations\n   This namespace enables ucode to be stored in\
    \ tags that are designed\n   to store URN.  Also, ucode-related information can\
    \ be described as\n   metadata using the URN namespace.  Thus, the namespace facilitates\n\
    \   the exchange of descriptions regarding objects and places among\n   multiple\
    \ organizations.\n   It is expected that many small-scale providers will offer\
    \ ucode tags\n   to small users and that large scale providers will hand out millions\n\
    \   of tags to users.\n   The resolution servers and applications will be available\
    \ to general\n   users with appropriate access control over the Internet.  The\n\
    \   published specification for resolver and access services for 'ucode'\n   allows\
    \ the creation of client software for many types of computers\n   including small\
    \ mobile terminals and ever-popular smartphones.\n"
