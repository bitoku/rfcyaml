  - "                      MORE ON STANDARD HOST NAMES\n   The Network Information\
    \ Center is a logical place to handle this\n   problem of Standard Host Names\
    \ and so the ball now rests here.\n   This is clearly a delicate subject with\
    \ people having strong\n   feelings and attachments to names.  No past proposal,\
    \ including\n   RFC 247, NIC 7668, has yet achieved any acceptance.  This\n  \
    \ identification seems a natural thing and should be taken into\n   account in\
    \ setting up a naming scheme.  Therefore, the following\n   proposal is offered\
    \ which I hope may be satisfactory to everyone.\n   Any naming scheme must:\n\
    \      (1)  Recognize the expanding character of the Network, with\n      the\
    \ potential eventually of several hundred sites.\n      (2)  Recognize the need\
    \ for abbreviations to simplify typing.\n      (3) Recognize the use of names\
    \ on hardcopy and online\n      documentation\n      (4)  Recognize people's strong\
    \ identification with historical\n      names associated with their project.\n\
    \   To meet these needs, we propose adoption of a hybrid scheme\n   related to\
    \ those in the other past proposals.\n   Each host will have a formal name of\
    \ the form:\n      <Institution Mnemonic>    \"-\"   <Host or NIC Station Mnemonic>\n\
    \      and an optional nickname of the form:\n                  <Nickname>\n \
    \  We have heard no arguments to support severe restrictions on name\n   length\
    \ and, therefore, human considerations should probably\n   prevail, but would\
    \ suggest the following guidelines.\n      <Institution Mnemonic> will be at most\
    \ 4 characters, formed as\n      per RFC 247, NIC (7688,).\n         Examples\
    \ of Institutions being:  AMES, CASE, BBN, UCLA,\n         SRI, MIT, HARV, MITR,\
    \ etc.\n         We must recognize that in the future there may be multiple\n\
    \         IMPS and TIPS and combinations at a given institution, so\n        \
    \ that there is not a one-to-one correspondence between\n         <Institution\
    \ Mnemonic> and IMPS or TIPS.  Also affiliated\n         with the Network, there\
    \ will be groups and individuals\n         without an IMP or a TIP, or with just\
    \ a terminal to a TIP,\n         whose organizations need unique names.\n    \
    \  <Host or Nic Station Mnemonic> will not have any restriction\n      on length,\
    \ but should if possible be short.  In picking <Host\n      or NIC Station Mnemonic>,\
    \ an order of priority for choosing\n      this mnemonic might be\n         (1)\
    \  Suborganization within the <Institution Mnemonic>.\n         (2)  Project mnemonic.\n\
    \         (3)  Machine designation.\n         (4) The suggestion in RFC 247, NIC\
    \ 7688 to include the\n         designation TIP or TEST should probably be followed\
    \ as\n         conveying useful information.\n         Examples might be:\n  \
    \          ARC, NMC, NCCTIP, TENEXA, TENEXB, MULTICS, ILLIAC, SAIL,\n        \
    \    DMCG, IMP, TX2, etc.\n      The <nickname> should be unique within the network\
    \ community,\n      short, and preferably should be the same as <Host or NIC\n\
    \      Station Mnemonic> to make life easy for people having to learn\n      them.\n\
    \   I would strongly recommend that Telnets recognize both the Formal\n   Name\
    \ and the Nickname.\n   Now the sticky question:  who chooses the names?  The\
    \ only\n   satisfactory answer is to allow the hosts, through their liaison,\n\
    \   to choose their own names, possibly subject to some discussion if\n   duplicate\
    \ or extra long names are picked.  Hosts or stations at a\n   given institution\
    \ should use the same <Institution Mnemonic>.\n   Let's settle this issue as soon\
    \ as possible, say by November 5;\n   each liaison please send me your names by\
    \ then.\n   If there are any implementation hardship cases, other than TIPs,\n\
    \   caused by the above scheme, please let me know as soon as\n   possible.\n\
