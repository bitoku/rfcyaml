- title: Abstract
  contents:
  - "Abstract\n   The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) schemes, \"cid:\" and \"mid:\"\
    \ allow\n   references to messages and the body parts of messages.  For example,\n\
    \   within a single multipart message, one HTML body part might include\n   embedded\
    \ references to other parts of the same message.\n"
- title: 1. Introduction
  contents:
  - "1. Introduction\n   The use of [MIME] within email to convey Web pages and their\n\
    \   associated images requires a URL scheme to permit the HTML to refer\n   to\
    \ the images or other data included in the message.  The Content-ID\n   Uniform\
    \ Resource Locator, \"cid:\", serves that purpose.\n   Similarly Net News readers\
    \ use Message-IDs to link related messages\n   together.  The Message-ID URL provides\
    \ a scheme, \"mid:\", to refer to\n   such messages as a \"resource\".\n   The\
    \ \"mid\" (Message-ID) and \"cid\" (Content-ID) URL schemes provide\n   identifiers\
    \ for messages and their body parts.  The \"mid\" scheme uses\n   (a part of)\
    \ the message-id of an email message to refer to a specific\n   message.  The\
    \ \"cid\" scheme refers to a specific body part of a\n   message; its use is generally\
    \ limited to references to other body\n   parts in the same message as the referring\
    \ body part.  The \"mid\"\n   scheme may also refer to a specific body part within\
    \ a designated\n   message, by including the content-ID's address.\n   A note\
    \ on terminology.  The terms \"body part\" and \"MIME entity\" are\n   used interchangeably.\
    \  They refer to the headers and body of a MIME\n   message, either the message\
    \ itself or one of the body parts contained\n   in a Multipart message.\n"
- title: 2. The MID and CID URL Schemes
  contents:
  - "2. The MID and CID URL Schemes\n   RFC1738 [URL] reserves the \"mid\" and \"\
    cid\" schemes for Message-ID and\n   Content-ID respectively.  This memorandum\
    \ defines the syntax for\n   those URLs.  Because they use the same syntactic\
    \ elements they are\n   presented together.\n   The URLs take the form\n     \
    \   content-id    = url-addr-spec\n        message-id    = url-addr-spec\n   \
    \     url-addr-spec = addr-spec  ; URL encoding of RFC 822 addr-spec\n       \
    \ cid-url       = \"cid\" \":\" content-id\n        mid-url       = \"mid\" \"\
    :\" message-id [ \"/\" content-id ]\n      Note: in Internet mail messages, the\
    \ addr-spec in a Content-ID\n      [MIME] or Message-ID [822] header are enclosed\
    \ in angle brackets\n      (<>).  Since addr-spec in a Message-ID or Content-ID\
    \ might contain\n      characters not allowed within a URL; any such character\
    \ (including\n      \"/\", which is reserved within the \"mid\" scheme) must be\
    \ hex-\n      encoded using the %hh escape mechanism in [URL].\n   A \"mid\" URL\
    \ with only a \"message-id\" refers to an entire message.\n   With the appended\
    \ \"content-id\", it refers to a body part within a\n   message, as does a \"\
    cid\" URL.  The Content-ID of a MIME body part is\n   required to be globally\
    \ unique.  However, in many systems that store\n   messages, body parts are not\
    \ indexed independently their context\n   (message).  The \"mid\" URL long form\
    \ was designed to supply the\n   context needed to support interoperability with\
    \ such systems.\n   A implementation conforming to this specification is required\
    \ to\n   support the \"mid\" URL long form (message-id/content-id).  Conforming\n\
    \   implementations can choose to, but are not required to, take\n   advantage\
    \ of the content-id's uniqueness and interpret a \"cid\" URL to\n   refer to any\
    \ body part within the message store.\n   In limited circumstances (e.g., within\
    \ multipart/alternate), a single\n   message may contain several body parts that\
    \ have the same Content-ID.\n   That occurs, for example, when identical data\
    \ can be accessed through\n   different methods [MIME, sect. 7.2.3].  In those\
    \ cases, conforming\n   implementations are required to use the rules of the containing\
    \ MIME\n   entity (e.g., multi-part/alternate) to select the body part to which\n\
    \   the Content-ID refers.\n   A \"cid\" URL is converted to the corresponding\
    \ Content-ID message\n   header [MIME] by removing the \"cid:\" prefix, converting\
    \ %hh hex-\n   escaped characters to their ASCII equivalents and enclosing the\n\
    \   remaining parts with an angle bracket pair, \"<\" and \">\".  For\n   example,\
    \ \"mid:foo4%25foo1@bar.net\" corresponds to\n        Message-ID: <foo4%foo1@bar.net>\n\
    \   A \"mid\" URL is converted to a Message-ID or Message-ID/Content-ID\n   pair\
    \ in a similar fashion.\n   Both message-id and content-id are required to be\
    \ globally unique.\n   That is, no two different messages will ever have the same\
    \ Message-ID\n   addr-spec; no different body parts will ever have the same Content-ID\n\
    \   addr-spec.  A common technique used by many message systems is to use\n  \
    \ a time and date stamp along with the local host's domain name, e.g.,\n   950124.162336@XIson.com.\n"

  contents:
  - "3. Security Considerations\n   The URLs defined here provide an addressing or\
    \ referencing mechanism.\n   The values of these URLs disclose no more about the\
    \ originators\n   environment than the corresponding Message-ID and Content-ID\
    \ values.\n   Where concern exists about such disclosures the originator of a\n\
    \   message using mid and cid URLs must take precautions to insure that\n   confidential\
    \ information is not disclosed.  Those precautions should\n   already be in place\
    \ to handle existing mail use of the Message-ID and\n   Content-ID.\n"
