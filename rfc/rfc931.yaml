  contents:
  - "STATUS OF THIS MEMO\n   This RFC suggests a proposed protocol for the ARPA-Internet\n\
    \   community, and requests discussion and suggestions for improvements.\n   This\
    \ is the second draft of this proposal (superseding RFC 912) and\n   incorporates\
    \ a more formal description of the syntax for the request\n   and response dialog,\
    \ as well as a change to specify the type of user\n   identification returned.\
    \  Distribution of this memo is unlimited.\n"
- title: INTRODUCTION
  contents:
  - "INTRODUCTION\n   The Authentication Server Protocol provides a means to determine\
    \ the\n   identity of a user of a particular TCP connection.  Given a TCP port\n\
    \   number pair, it returns a character string which identifies the owner\n  \
    \ of that connection on the server's system.  Suggested uses include\n   automatic\
    \ identification and verification of a user during an FTP\n   session, additional\
    \ verification of a TAC dial up user, and access\n   verification for a generalized\
    \ network file server.\n"
- title: OVERVIEW
  contents:
  - "OVERVIEW\n   This is a connection based application on TCP.  A server listens\
    \ for\n   TCP connections on TCP port 113 (decimal).  Once a connection is\n \
    \  established, the server reads one line of data which specifies the\n   connection\
    \ of interest.  If it exists, the system dependent user\n   identifier of the\
    \ connection of interest is sent out the connection.\n   The service closes the\
    \ connection after sending the user identifier.\n"
- title: RESTRICTIONS
  contents:
  - "RESTRICTIONS\n   Queries are permitted only for fully specified connections.\
    \ The\n   local/foreign host pair used to fully specify the connection are\n \
    \  taken from the query connection.  This means a user on Host A may\n   only\
    \ query the server on Host B about connections between A and B.\n"

- title: QUERY/RESPONSE FORMAT
  contents:
  - "QUERY/RESPONSE FORMAT\n   The server accepts simple text query requests of the\
    \ form\n      <local-port>, <foreign-port>\n   where <local-port> is the TCP port\
    \ (decimal) on the target (server)\n   system, and <foreign-port> is the TCP port\
    \ (decimal) on the source\n   (user) system.\n      For example:\n         23,\
    \ 6191\n   The response is of the form\n      <local-port>, <foreign-port> : <response-type>\
    \ : <additional-info>\n   where <local-port>,<foreign-port> are the same pair\
    \ as the query,\n   <response-type> is a keyword identifying the type of response,\
    \ and\n   <additional info> is context dependent.\n      For example:\n      \
    \   23, 6191 : USERID : MULTICS : StJohns.DODCSC.a\n         23, 6193 : USERID\
    \ : TAC : MCSJ-MITMUL\n         23, 6195 : ERROR : NO-USER\n"
- title: RESPONSE TYPES
  contents:
  - "RESPONSE TYPES\n   A response can be one of two types:\n   USERID\n      In this\
    \ case, <additional-info> is a string consisting of an\n      operating system\
    \ name, followed by a \":\", followed by user\n      identification string in\
    \ a format peculiar to the operating system\n      indicated.  Permitted operating\
    \ system names are specified in\n      RFC-923, \"Assigned Numbers\" or its successors.\
    \  The only other\n      names permitted are \"TAC\" to specify a BBN Terminal\
    \ Access\n      Controller, and \"OTHER\" to specify any other operating system\
    \ not\n      yet registered with the NIC.\n"

- title: CAVEATS
  contents:
  - "CAVEATS\n   Unfortunately, the trustworthiness of the various host systems that\n\
    \   might implement an authentication server will vary quite a bit.  It\n   is\
    \ up to the various applications that will use the server to\n   determine the\
    \ amount of trust they will place in the returned\n   information.  It may be\
    \ appropriate in some cases restrict the use of\n   the server to within a locally\
    \ controlled subnet.\n"
- title: APPLICATIONS
  contents:
  - "APPLICATIONS\n   1) Automatic user authentication for FTP\n      A user-FTP may\
    \ send a USER command with no argument to the\n      server-FTP to request automatic\
    \ authentication.  The server-FTP\n      will reply with a 230 (user logged in)\
    \ if it can use the\n      authentication.  It will reply with a 530 (not logged\
    \ in) if it\n      cannot authenticate the user.  It will reply with a 500 or\
    \ 501\n      (syntax or parameter problem) if it does not implement automatic\n\
    \      authentication.  Please note that no change is needed to currently\n  \
    \    implemented servers to handle the request for authentication; they\n    \
    \  will reject it normally as a parameter problem.  This is a\n      suggested\
    \ implementation for experimental use only.\n   2) Verification for privileged\
    \ network operations.  For example,\n   having the server start or stop special\
    \ purpose servers.\n"

    \ character (\":\"), and the port\n      pair separator character (\",\") must\
    \ be quoted if used within a\n      token.  The quote character is a back-slash,\

    \ outline of table driven\n   scheme for doing this.\n   The table consists of\
    \ four columns, the first three are used to match\n   against, the fourth is the\

    \ for a Multics system on MILNET at the\n   Pentagon.  When an authentication\
    \ is returned, the particular\n   application using the userid simply looks for\
    \ the first match in the\n   table.  Notice the second line.  It says that any\
    \ authentication\n   coming from a Multics system on Net 192.5.42 is accepted\
    \ in the same\n   format.\n   Obviously, various users will have to be registered\
    \ to use this\n   facility, but the registration can be done at the same time\
