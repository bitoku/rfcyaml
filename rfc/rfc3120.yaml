- title: Abstract
  contents:
  - "Abstract\n   This document describes a URN (Uniform Resource Name) namespace\
    \ that\n   is engineered by the Organization for the Advancement of Structured\n\
    \   Information Standards (OASIS) for naming persistent resources stored\n   in\
    \ the XML.org repository (such as XML (Extensible Markup Language)\n   Document\
    \ Type Definitions, XML Schemas, Namespaces, Stylesheets, and\n   other documents).\n"
- title: 1. Introduction
  contents:
  - "1. Introduction\n   The XML.org Registry is provided by XML.org as a public service\
    \ where\n   XML schemas, DTDs, stylesheets, and other documents can be shared.\n\
    \   Documents are submitted to a repository then retrieved by others who\n   may\
    \ want to use them.  These documents require unique identifiers.\n   Motivated\
    \ by these observations, XML.org would like to assign URNs to\n   some resources\
    \ in order to retain unique, permanent location-\n   independent names for them.\n\
    \   This namespace specification is for a formal namespace.\n"

    \ +1 (978) 667 5115\n   Declaration of structure:\n      The Namespace Specific\
    \ String (NSS) of all URNs assigned by\n      XML.org will have the following\
    \ hierarchical structure:\n      There is one branch at the top of the hierarchy:\
    \ \"objects\".\n      The Objects Hierarchy\n         The general structure of\
    \ the NSS in the names hierarchy has the\n         form:\n            urn:xmlorg:objects:{type}{:subtype}?:{object-id}\n\
    \         where \"type\" identifies the document type (document, schema,\n   \
    \      stylesheet, entity, xmlns, etc.), the optional \"subtype\"\n         provides\
    \ additional information about the document type (for\n         example, stylesheet\
    \ or schema language), and \"object-id\" is a\n         unique identifier for\
    \ the document.\n         The Director of Technical Operations at OASIS assigns\
    \ document\n         types, subtypes, and all unique identifiers.\n   Relevant\
    \ ancillary documentation:\n      None\n   Identifier uniqueness considerations:\n\
    \      Identifier uniqueness will be enforced by the Director of\n      Technical\
    \ Operations who assigns unique identifiers to all\n      documents identified\
    \ by URN.\n   Identifier persistence considerations:\n      OASIS is committed\
    \ to maintaining the accessibility and\n      persistence of all the resources\
    \ that are assigned URNs.\n   Process of identifier assignment:\n      Assignment\
    \ is limited to the owner and those authorities that are\n      specifically designated\
    \ by the owner.  OASIS may assign portions\n      of its namespace for assignment\
    \ by other parties.\n   Process of identifier resolution:\n      The owner will\
    \ distribute catalogs (OASIS TR9401 Catalogs) that\n      map the assigned URNs\
    \ to resource identifiers (e.g., URLs).  A\n      more interactive, online resolution\
    \ system will also be deployed\n      in the near future.\n      The owner will\
    \ authorize additional resolution services as\n      appropriate.\n   Rules for\
    \ Lexical Equivalence:\n      URNs are lexically equivalent if they are lexically\
    \ identical.\n   Conformance with URN Syntax:\n      No special considerations.\n\
    \   Validation mechanism:\n      None specified.  The owner will publish OASIS\
    \ TR9401 Catalogs.\n      The presence of a URN in a catalog indicates that it\
    \ is valid.\n   Scope:\n      Global\n"
