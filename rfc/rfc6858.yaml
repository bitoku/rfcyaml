- title: 1.  Overview
  contents:
  - "1.  Overview\n   A conventional IMAP or POP client may open a mailbox containing\n\
    \   internationalized messages or may even attempt to read\n   internationalized\
    \ messages, for instance, when a user has both\n   internationalized and conventional\
    \ Mail User Agents (MUAs).\n   Some operations cannot be performed by conventional\
    \ clients.  Most\n   importantly, an internationalized message usually contains\
    \ at least\n   one internationalized address, so address-based operations are\
    \ rarely\n   possible.  This includes displaying the addresses, replying to\n\
    \   messages, and the processing of most types of address-based signature\n  \
    \ or security.\n   However, the sender's name, message subject, body of text,\
    \ and\n   attachments can easily be displayed, so a helpful IMAP or POP server\n\
    \   may prefer to display as much of the message as possible, rather than\n  \
    \ hide the message entirely.\n   This document specifies a way to present such\
    \ messages to the client.\n   It values simplicity of implementation over fidelity\
    \ of\n   representation, since implementing a high-fidelity downgrade\n   algorithm\
    \ such as the one specified in a companion document [RFC6857]\n   is likely more\
    \ work than implementing proper UTF-8 support for POP\n   [RFC6856] and/or IMAP\
    \ [RFC6855].\n   The server is assumed to be internationalized internally and\
    \ to store\n   messages that are internationalized messages natively.  When it\
    \ needs\n   to present an internationalized message to a conventional client,\
    \ the\n   server synthesizes a conventional message containing most of the\n \
    \  information and presents the \"surrogate message\".\n   This specification\
    \ modifies the base IMAP specification [RFC3501] by\n   relaxing a requirement\
    \ that sizes be exact and adding a reporting\n   requirement as discussed in Section\
    \ 3 below.\n"
- title: 2.  Information Preserved and Lost
  contents:
  - "2.  Information Preserved and Lost\n   The surrogate message is intended to convey\
    \ the most important\n   information to the user.  Where information is lost,\
    \ the user should\n   consider the message incomplete rather than modified.\n\
    \   The surrogate message is not intended to convey any information to\n   the\
    \ client software that would require or enable it to apply special\n   handling\
    \ to the message.  Client authors who wish to handle\n   internationalized messages\
    \ are encouraged to implement POP [RFC6856]\n   and/or IMAP [RFC6855] support\
    \ for UTF-8.\n   Uppercase letters in examples represent non-ASCII characters.\n\
    \   example.com is a plain domain; EXAMPLE.com represents a non-ASCII\n   domain\
    \ in the .com top-level domain.\n"
- title: 2.1.  Email Addresses
  contents:
  - "2.1.  Email Addresses\n   Each internationalized email address in the header\
    \ fields listed\n   below is replaced with an invalid email address whose display-name\n\
    \   tells the user what happened.\n   The format of the display-name is explicitly\
    \ unspecified.  Anything\n   that tells the user what happened is good.  Anything\
    \ that produces an\n   email address that might belong to someone else is bad.\n\
    \   Given an internationalized address \"Fred Foo <fred@EXAMPLE.com>\", an\n \
    \  implementation may choose to render it as one of these examples:\n      \"\
    fred@EXAMPLE.com\" <invalid@internationalized-address.invalid>\n      Fred Foo\
    \ <invalid@internationalized.invalid>\n      internationalized-address:;\n   \
    \   fred:;\n   The .invalid top-level domain is reserved as a Top Level DNS Name\n\
    \   [RFC2606]; therefore, the first two examples are syntactically valid,\n  \
    \ but they will never belong to anyone.  Note that the display-name\n   often\
    \ needs encoding (see the Message Header Extensions document\n   [RFC2047]).\n\
    \   The affected header fields are \"Bcc:\", \"Cc:\", \"From:\", \"Reply-To:\"\
    ,\n   \"Resent-Bcc:\", \"Resent-Cc:\", \"Resent-From:\", \"Resent-Sender:\",\n\
    \   \"Resent-To:\", \"Return-Path:\", \"Sender:\", and \"To:\".  Any addresses\n\
    \   present in other header fields, such as \"Received:\", are not regarded\n\
    \   as addresses by this specification.\n"
- title: 2.2.  MIME Parameters
  contents:
  - "2.2.  MIME Parameters\n   Any MIME parameter [RFC2045] (whether in the message\
    \ header or a body\n   part header) that cannot be presented to the client exactly\
    \ as it\n   appears in the incoming message is silently excised.\n   Given a field\
    \ such as\n      Content-Disposition: attachment; filename=FOO\n   the field is\
    \ presented as\n      Content-Disposition: attachment\n"
- title: 2.3.  Subject Field
  contents:
  - "2.3.  Subject Field\n   If the Subject field cannot be presented to the client\
    \ exactly as it\n   appears in the incoming message, the server presents a representation\n\
    \   encoded as specified in RFC 2047.\n"
- title: 2.4.  Remaining Header Fields
  contents:
  - "2.4.  Remaining Header Fields\n   Any header field that cannot be presented to\
    \ the client, even with\n   the modifications listed in Sections 2.1-2.3, is silently\
    \ excised.\n"
- title: 3.  IMAP-Specific Details
  contents:
  - "3.  IMAP-Specific Details\n   IMAP allows clients to retrieve the message size\
    \ without downloading\n   the message, using RFC822.SIZE, BODY.SIZE[] and so on.\
    \  The IMAP\n   specification [RFC3501] requires that the returned size be exact.\n\
    \   This specification relaxes that requirement.  When a conventional\n   client\
    \ requests size information for a message, the IMAP server is\n   permitted to\
    \ return size information for the internationalized\n   message, even though the\
    \ size of the surrogate message differs.\n   When an IMAP server performs downgrading\
    \ as part of generating FETCH\n   responses, it reports which messages were synthesized\
    \ using a\n   response code and attendant UID (Unique Identifier) set.  This can\
    \ be\n   helpful to humans debugging the server and/or client.\n      C: a UID\
    \ FETCH 1:* BODY.PEEK[HEADER.FIELDS(To From Cc)]\n      S: 1 FETCH (UID 65 [...]\n\
    \      S: 2 FETCH (UID 70 [...]\n      S: a OK [DOWNGRADED 70,105,108,109] Done\n\
    \   The message-set argument to DOWNGRADED contains UIDs.\n   Note that DOWNGRADED\
    \ does not necessarily mention all the\n   internationalized messages in the mailbox.\
    \  In the example above, we\n   know that UID 65 does not contain internationalized\
    \ addresses in the\n   \"From:\", \"To:\", and \"Cc:\" fields.  It may, for example,\
    \ contain an\n   internationalized \"Subject:\".\n"
- title: 4.  POP-Specific Details
  contents:
  - "4.  POP-Specific Details\n   The number of lines specified in the TOP command\
    \ [RFC1939] refers to\n   the surrogate message.  The message size reported by,\
    \ for example,\n   LIST may refer to either the internationalized or the surrogate\n\
    \   message.\n"
- title: 5.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "5.  Security Considerations\n   If the internationalized message uses any sort\
    \ of signature that\n   covers header fields, the signature of the surrogate message\
    \ almost\n   certainly is invalid and may be invalid in other cases.  This is\
    \ a\n   necessary limitation of displaying internationalized messages in\n   legacy\
    \ clients, since those clients do not support internationalized\n   header fields.\
    \  These cases are discussed in more detail in the POP\n   or IMAP Downgrade document\
    \ [RFC6857].  Even though invalid, these\n   signatures should not be removed\
    \ from the surrogate message, to\n   preserve as much of the information as possible\
    \ from the original\n   message.\n   If any excised information is significant,\
    \ then that information does\n   not arrive at the recipient.  Notably, the \"\
    Message-Id:\",\n   \"In-Reference-To:\", and \"References:\" fields may be excised,\
    \ which\n   might cause a lack of context when the recipient reads the message.\n\
    \   Some POP or IMAP clients, such as Fetchmail, download messages and\n   delete\
    \ the versions on the server.  This may lead to permanent loss\n   of information\
    \ when the only remaining version of a message is the\n   surrogate message.\n\
    \   Other clients cache messages for a very long time, even across client\n  \
    \ upgrades, such as the stock Android client.  When such a client is\n   internationalized,\
    \ care must be taken so that it does not use an old\n   surrogate message from\
    \ its cache rather than retrieve the real\n   message from the server.\n"
