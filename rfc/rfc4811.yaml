  - "Abstract\n   OSPF is a link-state intra-domain routing protocol used in IP\n\
    \   networks.  Link State Database (LSDB) synchronization in OSPF is\n   achieved\
    \ via two methods -- initial LSDB synchronization when an OSPF\n   router has\
    \ just been connected to the network and asynchronous\n   flooding that ensures\
    \ continuous LSDB synchronization in the presence\n   of topology changes after\
    \ the initial procedure was completed.  It\n   may sometime be necessary for OSPF\
    \ routers to resynchronize their\n   LSDBs.  The OSPF standard, however, does\
    \ not allow routers to do so\n   without actually changing the topology view of\
    \ the network.\n   This memo describes a vendor-specific mechanism to perform\
    \ such a\n   form of out-of-band LSDB synchronization.  The mechanism described\
    \ in\n   this document was proposed before Graceful OSPF Restart, as described\n\
    \   in RFC 3623, came into existence.  It is implemented/supported by at\n   least\
    \ one major vendor and is currently deployed in the field.  The\n   purpose of\
    \ this document is to capture the details of this mechanism\n   for public use.\
    \  This mechanism is not an IETF standard.\n"

  - "1.  Introduction\n   According to the OSPF standard [RFC2328], after two OSPF\
    \ routers have\n   established an adjacency (the neighbor Finite State Machines\
    \ (FSMs)\n   have reached Full state), routers announce the adjacency states in\n\
    \   their router-Link State Advertisements (LSAs).  Asynchronous flooding\n  \
    \ algorithm ensures that routers' LSDBs stay in sync in the presence of\n   topology\
    \ changes.  However, if routers need (for some reason) to\n   resynchronize their\
    \ LSDBs, they cannot do that without actually\n   putting the neighbor FSMs into\
    \ the ExStart state.  This effectively\n   causes the adjacencies to be removed\
    \ from the router-LSAs, which may\n   not be acceptable if the desire is to prevent\
    \ routing table flaps\n   during database resynchronization.  In this document,\
    \ we provide the\n   means for so-called out-of-band (OOB) LSDB resynchronization.\n\
    \   The described mechanism can be used in a number of situations\n   including\
    \ those where the routers are picking up the adjacencies\n   after a reload. \
    \ The process of adjacency preemption is outside the\n   scope of this document.\
    \  Only the details related to LSDB\n   resynchronization are mentioned herein.\n"
- title: 2.  Proposed Solution
  contents:
  - "2.  Proposed Solution\n   With this Out-of-Band Resynchronization Solution, the\
    \ format of the\n   OSPF Database Description (DBD) packet is changed to include\
    \ a new\n   R-bit indicating OOB LSDB resynchronization.  All DBD packets sent\n\
    \   during the OOB resynchronization procedure are sent with the R-bit\n   set.\n\
    \   Also, two new fields are added to the neighbor data structure.  The\n   first\
    \ field indicates a neighbor's OOB resynchronization capability.\n   The second\
    \ indicates that OOB LSDB resynchronization is in process.\n   The latter field\
    \ allows OSPF implementations to utilize the existing\n   neighbor FSM code.\n\
    \   A bit is occupied in the Extended Options (EO) TLV (see [RFC4813]).\n   Routers\
    \ set this bit to indicate their capability to support the\n   described technique.\n"

- title: 2.2.  OSPF Neighbor Data Structure
  contents:
  - "2.2.  OSPF Neighbor Data Structure\n   A field is introduced into OSPF neighbor\
    \ data structure, as described\n   below.  The name of the field is OOBResync,\
    \ and it is a flag\n   indicating that the router is currently performing OOB\
    \ LSDB\n   resynchronization with the neighbor.\n   The OOBResync flag is set\
    \ when the router is initiating OOB LSDB\n   resynchronization (see Section 2.6\
    \ for more details).\n   Routers clear the OOBResync flag on the following conditions:\n\
    \    o  The neighbor data structure is first created.\n    o  The neighbor FSM\
    \ transitions to any state lower than ExStart.\n    o  The neighbor FSM transitions\
    \ to the ExStart state because a DBD\n       packet with the R-bit clear has been\
    \ received.\n    o  The neighbor FSM reaches the state Full.\n   Note that the\
    \ OOBResync flag may have a TRUE value only if the\n   neighbor FSM is in states\
    \ ExStart, Exchange, or Loading.  As\n   indicated above, if the FSM transitions\
    \ to any other state, the\n   OOBResync flag should be cleared.\n   It is important\
    \ to mention that operation of the OSPF neighbor FSM is\n   not changed by this\
    \ document.  However, depending on the state of the\n   OOBResync flag, the router\
    \ sends either normal DBD packets or DBD\n   packets with the R-bit set.\n"
- title: 2.3.  Hello Packets
  contents:
  - "2.3.  Hello Packets\n   Routers capable of performing OOB LSDB resynchronization\
    \ should\n   always set the LR-bit in their Hello packets.\n"
- title: 2.4.  DBD Packets
  contents:
  - "2.4.  DBD Packets\n   Routers supporting the described technique should always\
    \ set the LR-\n   bit in the DBD packets.  Since the Options field of the initial\
    \ DBD\n   packet is stored in corresponding neighbor data structure, the LR-bit\n\
    \   may be used later to check if a neighbor is capable of performing OOB\n  \
    \ LSDB resynchronization.\n   The format of type 2 (DBD) OSPF packets is changed\

    \                Figure 2.  Modified DBD Packet\n   The R-bit in OSPF type 2 packets\
    \ is set when the OOBResync flag for\n   the specific neighbor is set to TRUE.\
    \  If a DBD packets with the R-\n   bit clear is received for a neighbor with\
    \ active OOBResync flag, the\n   OOB LSDB resynchronization process is canceled\
    \ and normal LSDB\n   synchronization procedure is initiated.\n   When a DBD packet\
    \ is received with the R-bit set and the sender is\n   known to be OOB-incapable,\
    \ the packet should be dropped and a\n   SeqNumber-Mismatch event should be generated\
    \ for the neighbor.\n   Processing of DBD packets is modified as follows:\n  \
    \  1.  If the OOBResync flag for the neighbor is set (the LSDB\n        resynchronization\
    \ process has been started) and the received DBD\n        packet does not have\
    \ the R-bit set, ignore the packet and\n        generate a SeqNumberMismatch event\
    \ for the neighbor FSM.\n    2.  Otherwise, if the OOBResync flag for the neighbor\
    \ is clear and\n        the received DBD packet has the R-bit set, perform the\
    \ following\n        steps:\n        *  If the neighbor FSM is in state Full and\
    \ bits I, M, and MS\n           are set in the DBD packet, set the OOBResync flag\
    \ for the\n           neighbor, put the FSM in ExStart state, and continue\n \
    \          processing the DBD packet as described in [RFC2328].\n        *  Otherwise,\
    \ ignore received DBD packet (no OOB DBD packets are\n           allowed with\
    \ OOBResync flag clear and FSM in state other than\n           Full).  Also, if\
    \ the state of the FSM is Exchange or higher,\n           generate a SeqNumberMismatch\
    \ event for the neighbor FSM.\n    3.  Otherwise, process the DBD packet as described\
    \ in [RFC2328].\n   During normal processing of the initial OOB DBD packet (with\
    \ bits R,\n   I, M, and MS set), if the receiving router is selected to be the\n\
    \   Master, it may speed up the resynchronization process by immediately\n   replying\
    \ to the received packet.\n   It is also necessary to limit the time an adjacency\
    \ can spend in\n   ExStart, Exchange, and Loading states with OOBResync flag set\
    \ to a\n   finite period of time (e.g., by limiting the number of times DBD and\n\
    \   link state request packets can be retransmitted).  If the adjacency\n   does\
    \ not proceed to Full state before the timeout, it is indicative\n   that the\
    \ neighboring router cannot resynchronize its LSDB with the\n   local router.\
    \  The requesting router may decide to stop trying to\n   resynchronize the LSDB\
    \ over this adjacency (if, for example, it can\n   be resynchronized via another\
    \ neighbor on the same segment) or to\n   resynchronize using the legacy method\
    \ by clearing the OOBResync flag\n   and leaving the FSM in ExStart state.  The\
    \ neighboring router may\n   decide to cancel the OOB procedure for the neighbor.\n"
