  - "1.  Introduction\n   The Internet has been growing dramatically in terms of size,\n\
    \   capacity, and accessibility in recent years.  Communication\n   requirements\
    \ of distributed services and applications running on top\n   of the Internet\
    \ have become increasingly demanding.  Some examples\n   are real-time interactive\
    \ video or financial trading.  Providing such\n   services involves stringent\
    \ requirements in terms of acceptable\n   latency, loss, and jitter.\n   Performance\
    \ requirements lead to the articulation of Service Level\n   Objectives (SLOs)\
    \ that must be met.  Those SLOs are part of Service\n   Level Agreements (SLAs)\
    \ that define a contract between the provider\n   and the consumer of a service.\
    \  SLOs, in effect, constitute a\n   service-level guarantee that the consumer\
    \ of the service can expect\n   to receive (and often has to pay for).  Likewise,\
    \ the provider of a\n   service needs to ensure that the service-level guarantee\
    \ and\n   associated SLOs are met.  Some examples of clauses that relate to\n\
    \   SLOs can be found in [RFC7297].\n   Violations of SLOs can be associated with\
    \ significant financial loss,\n   which can by divided into two categories.  First,\
    \ there is the loss\n   that can be incurred by the user of a service when the\
    \ agreed service\n   levels are not provided.  For example, a financial brokerage's\
    \ stock\n   orders might suffer losses when it is unable to execute stock\n  \
    \ transactions in a timely manner.  An electronic retailer may lose\n   customers\
    \ when its online presence is perceived by customers as\n   sluggish.  An online\
    \ gaming provider may not be able to provide fair\n   access to online players,\
    \ resulting in frustrated players who are\n   lost as customers.  In each case,\
    \ the failure of a service provider\n   to meet promised service-level guarantees\
    \ can have a substantial\n   financial impact on users of the service.  Second,\
    \ there is the loss\n   that is incurred by the provider of a service who is unable\
    \ to meet\n   promised SLOs.  Those losses can take several forms, such as\n \
    \  penalties for violating the service level agreement and even loss of\n   future\
    \ revenue due to reduced customer satisfaction (which, in many\n   cases, is more\
    \ serious).  Hence, SLOs are a key concern for the\n   service provider.  In order\
    \ to ensure that SLOs are not being\n   violated, service levels need to be continuously\
    \ monitored at the\n   network infrastructure layer in order to know, for example,\
    \ when\n   mitigating actions need to be taken.  To that end, service-level\n\
    \   measurements must take place.\n   Network measurements can be performed using\
    \ active or passive\n   measurement techniques.  In passive measurements, production\
    \ traffic\n   is observed, and no monitoring traffic is created by the measurement\n\
    \   process itself.  That is, network conditions are checked in a\n   non-intrusive\
    \ way.  In the context of IP Flow Information Export\n   (IPFIX), several documents\
    \ were produced that define how to export\n   data associated with flow records,\
    \ i.e., data that is collected as\n   part of passive measurement mechanisms,\
    \ generally applied against\n   flows of production traffic (e.g., [RFC7011]).\
    \  In addition, it is\n   possible to collect real data traffic (not just summarized\
    \ flow\n   records) with time-stamped packets, possibly sampled (e.g., per\n \
    \  [RFC5474]), as a means of measuring and inferring service levels.\n   Active\
    \ measurements, on the other hand, are more intrusive to the\n   network in the\
    \ sense that they involve injecting synthetic test\n   traffic into the network\
    \ to measure network service levels, as\n   opposed to simply observing production\
    \ traffic.  The IP Performance\n   Metrics (IPPM) Working Group produced documents\
    \ that describe active\n   measurement mechanisms such as the One-Way Active Measurement\n\
    \   Protocol (OWAMP) [RFC4656], the Two-Way Active Measurement Protocol\n   (TWAMP)\
    \ [RFC5357], and the Cisco Service-Level Assurance Protocol\n   [RFC6812].  In\
    \ addition, there are some mechanisms that do not\n   cleanly fit into either\
    \ active or passive categories, such as\n   Performance and Diagnostic Metrics\
    \ (PDM) Destination Option\n   techniques [RFC8250].\n   Active measurement mechanisms\
    \ offer a high level of control over what\n   and how to measure.  They do not\
    \ require inspecting production\n   traffic.  Because of this, active measurements\
    \ usually offer better\n   accuracy and privacy than passive measurement mechanisms.\
    \  Traffic\n   encryption and regulations that limit the amount of payload\n \
    \  inspection that can occur are non-issues.  Furthermore, active\n   measurement\
    \ mechanisms are able to detect end-to-end network\n   performance problems in\
    \ a fine-grained way (e.g., simulating the\n   traffic that must be handled considering\
    \ specific SLOs).  As a\n   result, active measurements are often preferred over\
    \ passive\n   measurement for SLA monitoring.  Measurement probes must be hosted\
    \ in\n   network devices and measurement sessions must be activated to compute\n\
    \   the current network metrics (for example, metrics such as the ones\n   described\
    \ in [RFC4148], although note that [RFC4148] was obsoleted by\n   [RFC6248]).\
    \  This activation should be dynamic in order to follow\n   changes in network\
    \ conditions, such as those related to routes being\n   added or new customer\
    \ demands.\n   While offering many advantages, active measurements are expensive\
    \ in\n   terms of network resource consumption.  Active measurements generally\n\
    \   involve measurement probes that generate synthetic test traffic that\n   is\
    \ directed at a responder.  The responder needs to timestamp test\n   traffic\
    \ it receives and reflect it back to the originating\n   measurement probe.  The\
    \ measurement probe subsequently processes the\n   returned packets along with\
    \ time-stamping information in order to\n   compute service levels.  Accordingly,\
    \ active measurements consume\n   substantial CPU cycles as well as memory of\
    \ network devices to\n   generate and process test traffic.  In addition, synthetic\
    \ traffic\n   increases network load.  Thus, active measurements compete for\n\
    \   resources with other functions, including routing and switching.\n   The resources\
    \ required and traffic generated by the active\n   measurement sessions are, in\
    \ a large part, a function of the number\n   of measured network destinations.\
    \  (In addition, the amount of\n   traffic generated for each measurement plays\
    \ a role that, in turn,\n   influences the accuracy of the measurement.)  When\
    \ more destinations\n   are measured, a greater number of resources are consumed\
    \ and more\n   traffic is needed to perform the measurements.  Thus, to have better\n\
    \   monitoring coverage, it is necessary to deploy more sessions, which\n   consequently\
    \ increases consumed resources.  Otherwise, enabling the\n   observation of just\
    \ a small subset of all network flows can lead to\n   insufficient coverage.\n\
    \   Furthermore, while some end-to-end service levels can be determined\n   by\
    \ adding up the service levels observed across different path\n   segments, the\
    \ same is not true for all service levels.  For example,\n   the end-to-end delay\
    \ or packet loss from a node A to a node C routed\n   via a node B can often be\
    \ computed simply by adding delays (or loss)\n   from A to B and from B to C.\
    \  This allows the decomposition of a\n   large set of end-to-end measurements\
    \ into a much smaller set of\n   segment measurements.  However, end-to-end jitter\
    \ and mean opinion\n   scores cannot be decomposed as easily and, for higher accuracy,\
    \ must\n   be measured end-to-end.\n   Hence, the decision about how to place\
    \ measurement probes becomes an\n   important management activity.  The goal is\
    \ to obtain the maximum\n   benefits of service-level monitoring with a limited\
    \ amount of\n   measurement overhead.  Specifically, the goal is to maximize the\n\
    \   number of service-level violations that are detected with a limited\n   number\
    \ of resources.\n   The use case and the solution approach described in this document\n\
    \   address an important practical issue.  They are intended to provide a\n  \
    \ basis for further experimentation to lead to solutions for wider\n   deployment.\
    \  This document represents the consensus of the IRTF's\n   Network Management\
    \ Research Group (NMRG).  It was discussed\n   extensively and received three\
    \ separate in-depth reviews.\n"

- title: 3.  Current Approaches
  contents:
  - "3.  Current Approaches\n   For feasible deployments of active measurement solutions\
    \ to\n   distribute the available measurement sessions along the network, the\n\
    \   current best practice consists of relying entirely on the human\n   administrator's\
    \ expertise to infer the best location to activate such\n   sessions.  This is\
    \ done through several steps.  First, it is\n   necessary to collect traffic information\
    \ in order to grasp the\n   traffic matrix.  Then, the administrator uses this\
    \ information to\n   infer the best destinations for measurement sessions.  After\
    \ that,\n   the administrator activates sessions on the chosen subset of\n   destinations,\
    \ taking the available resources into account.  This\n   practice, however, does\
    \ not scale well because it is still labor\n   intensive and error-prone for the\
    \ administrator to determine which\n   sessions should be activated given the\
    \ set of critical flows that\n   needs to be measured.  Even worse, this practice\
    \ completely fails in\n   networks where the most critical flows change rapidly,\
    \ resulting in\n   dynamic changes to what would be the most important destinations.\n\
    \   For example, this can be the case in modern cloud environments.  This\n  \
    \ is because fast reactions are necessary to reconfigure the sessions,\n   and\
    \ administrators are just not quick enough in computing and\n   activating the\
    \ new set of required sessions every time the network\n   traffic pattern changes.\
    \  Finally, the current practice for active\n   measurements usually covers only\
    \ a fraction of the network flows that\n   should be observed, which invariably\
    \ leads to the damaging\n   consequence of undetected SLA violations.\n"
- title: 4.  Use Case Description
  contents:
  - "4.  Use Case Description\n   The use case involves a service-level provider that\
    \ needs to monitor\n   the network to detect service-level violations using active\
    \ service-\n   level measurements and wants to be able to do so with minimal human\n\
    \   intervention.  The goal is to conduct the measurements in an\n   effective\
    \ manner to maximize the percentage of detected service-level\n   violations.\
    \  The service-level provider has a bounded resource budget\n   with regard to\
    \ measurements that can be performed, specifically the\n   number of measurements\
    \ that can be conducted concurrently from any\n   one network device and possibly\
    \ the total amount of measurement\n   traffic on the network.  However, while\
    \ at any one point in time the\n   number of measurements conducted is limited,\
    \ it is possible for a\n   device to change which destinations to measure over\
    \ time.  This can\n   be exploited to achieve a balance of eventually covering\
    \ all possible\n   destinations using a reasonable amount of \"sampling\" where\n\
    \   measurement coverage of a destination cannot be continuous.  The\n   solution\
    \ needs to be dynamic and able to cope with network conditions\n   that may change\
    \ over time.  The solution should also be embeddable\n   inside network devices\
    \ that control the deployment of active\n   measurement mechanisms.\n   The goal\
    \ is to conduct the measurements in a smart manner that\n   ensures that the network\
    \ is broadly covered and that the likelihood\n   of detecting service-level violations\
    \ is maximized.  In order to\n   maximize that likelihood, it is reasonable to\
    \ focus measurement\n   resources on destinations that are more likely to incur\
    \ a violation,\n   while spending fewer resources on destinations that are more\
    \ likely\n   to be in compliance.  In order to do this, there are various aspects\n\
    \   that can be exploited, including past measurements (destinations\n   close\
    \ to a service-level threshold requiring more focus than\n   destinations farther\
    \ from it), complementation with passive\n   measurements such as flow data (to\
    \ identify network destinations that\n   are currently popular and critical),\
    \ and observations from other\n   parts of the network.  In addition, measurements\
    \ can be coordinated\n   among different network devices to avoid hitting the\
    \ same destination\n   at the same time and to share results that may be useful\
    \ in future\n   probe placement.\n   Clearly, static solutions will have severe\
    \ limitations.  At the same\n   time, human administrators cannot be in the loop\
    \ for continuous\n   dynamic reconfigurations of measurement probes.  Thus, an\
    \ automated\n   solution, or ideally an autonomic solution, is needed so that\
    \ network\n   measurements are automatically orchestrated and dynamically\n  \
    \ reconfigured from within the network.  This can be accomplished using\n   an\
    \ autonomic solution that is distributed, using ASAs that are\n   implemented\
    \ on nodes in the network.\n"
- title: 5.  A Distributed Autonomic Solution
  contents:
  - "5.  A Distributed Autonomic Solution\n   The use of Autonomic Networking (AN)\
    \ [RFC7575] can help such\n   detection through an efficient activation of measurement\
    \ sessions.\n   Such an approach, along with a detailed assessment confirming\
    \ its\n   viability, is described in [P2PBNM-Nobre-2012].  The problem to be\n\
    \   solved by AN in the present use case is how to steer the process of\n   measurement\
    \ session activation by a complete solution that sets all\n   necessary parameters\
    \ for this activation to operate efficiently,\n   reliably, and securely, with\
    \ no required human intervention other\n   than setting overall policy.\n   When\
    \ a node first comes online, it has no information about which\n   measurements\
    \ are more critical than others.  In the absence of\n   information about past\
    \ measurements and information from measurement\n   peers, it may start with an\
    \ initial set of measurement sessions,\n   possibly randomly seeding a set of\
    \ starter measurements and perhaps\n   taking a round-robin approach for subsequent\
    \ measurement rounds.\n   However, as measurements are collected, a node will\
    \ gain an\n   increasing amount of information that it can utilize to refine its\n\
    \   strategy of selecting measurement targets going forward.  For one, it\n  \
    \ may take note of which targets returned measurement results very\n   close to\
    \ service-level thresholds; these targets may require closer\n   scrutiny compared\
    \ to others.  Second, it may utilize observations\n   that are made by its measurement\
    \ peers in order to conclude which\n   measurement targets may be more critical\
    \ than others and to ensure\n   that proper overall measurement coverage is obtained\
    \ (so that not\n   every node incidentally measures the same targets, while other\n\
    \   targets are not measured at all).\n   We advocate for embedding P2P technology\
    \ in network devices in order\n   to use autonomic control loops to make decisions\
    \ about measurement\n   sessions.\n   Specifically, we advocate for network devices\
    \ to implement an\n   autonomic function that monitors service levels for violations\
    \ of\n   SLOs and that determines which measurement sessions to set up at any\n\
    \   given point in time based on current and past observations of the\n   node\
    \ and of other peer nodes.\n   By performing these functions locally and autonomically\
    \ on the device\n   itself, which measurements to conduct can be modified quickly\
    \ based\n   on local observations while taking local resource availability into\n\
    \   account.  This allows a solution to be more robust and react more\n   dynamically\
    \ to rapidly changing service levels than a solution that\n   has to rely on central\
    \ coordination.  However, in order to optimize\n   decisions about which measurements\
    \ to conduct, a node will need to\n   communicate with other nodes.  This allows\
    \ a node to take into\n   account other nodes' observations in addition to its\
    \ own in its\n   decisions.\n   For example, remote destinations whose observed\
    \ service levels are on\n   the verge of violating stated objectives may require\
    \ closer\n   monitoring than remote destinations that are comfortably within a\n\
    \   range of tolerance.  A distributed autonomic solution also allows\n   nodes\
    \ to coordinate their probing decisions to collectively achieve\n   the best possible\
    \ measurement coverage.  Because the number of\n   resources available for monitoring,\
    \ exchanging measurement data, and\n   coordinating with other nodes is limited,\
    \ a node may be interested in\n   identifying other nodes whose observations are\
    \ similar to and\n   correlated with its own.  This helps a node prioritize and\
    \ decide\n   which other nodes to coordinate and exchange data with.  All of this\n\
    \   requires the use of a P2P overlay.\n   A P2P overlay is essential for several\
    \ reasons:\n   o  It makes it possible for nodes (or more specifically, the ASAs\n\
    \      that are deployed on those nodes) in the network to autonomically\n   \
    \   set up measurement sessions without having to rely on a central\n      management\
    \ system or controller to perform configuration\n      operations associated with\
    \ configuring measurement probes and\n      responders.\n   o  It facilitates\
    \ the exchange of data between different nodes to\n      share measurement results\
    \ so that each node can refine its\n      measurement strategy based not just\
    \ on its own observations, but\n      also on observations from its peers.\n \
    \  o  It allows nodes to coordinate their measurements to obtain the\n      best\
    \ possible test coverage and avoid measurements that have a\n      very low likelihood\
    \ of detecting service-level violations.\n   The provisioning of the P2P overlay\
    \ should be transparent for the\n   network administrator.  An Autonomic Control\
    \ Plane such as defined in\n   [ACP] provides an ideal candidate for the P2P overlay\
    \ to run on.\n   An autonomic solution for the distributed detection of SLA violations\n\
    \   provides several benefits.  First, it provides efficiency; this\n   solution\
    \ should optimize the resource consumption and avoid resource\n   starvation on\
    \ the network devices.  A device that is \"self-aware\" of\n   its available resources\
    \ will be able to adjust measurement activities\n   rapidly as needed, without\
    \ requiring a separate control loop\n   involving resource monitoring by an external\
    \ system.  Second, placing\n   logic about where to conduct measurements into\
    \ the node enables rapid\n   control loops that allow devices to react instantly\
    \ to observations\n   and adjust their measurement strategy.  For example, a device\
    \ could\n   decide to adjust the amount of synthetic test traffic being sent\n\
    \   during the measurement itself depending on results observed so far on\n  \
    \ this and other concurrent measurement sessions.  As a result, the\n   solution\
    \ could decrease the time necessary to detect SLA violations.\n   Adaptivity features\
    \ of an autonomic loop could capture the network\n   dynamics faster than a human\
    \ administrator or even a central\n   controller.  Finally, the solution could\
    \ help to reduce the workload\n   of human administrators.\n   In practice, these\

  - "6.  Intended User Experience\n   The autonomic solution should not require any\
    \ human intervention in\n   the distributed detection of SLA violations.  By virtue\
    \ of the\n   solution being autonomic, human users will not have to plan which\n\
    \   measurements to conduct in a network, which is often a very labor-\n   intensive\
    \ task that requires detailed analysis of traffic matrices\n   and network topologies\
    \ and is not prone to easy dynamic adjustment.\n   Likewise, they will not have\
    \ to configure measurement probes and\n   responders.\n   There are some ways\
    \ in which a human administrator may still interact\n   with the solution.  First,\
    \ the human administrator will, of course,\n   be notified and obtain reports\
    \ about service-level violations that\n   are observed.  Second, a human administrator\
    \ may set policies\n   regarding how closely to monitor the network for service-level\n\
    \   violations and how many resources to spend.  For example, an\n   administrator\
    \ may set a resource budget that is assigned to network\n   devices for measurement\
    \ operations.  With that given budget, the\n   number of SLO violations that are\
    \ detected will be maximized.\n   Alternatively, an administrator may set a target\
    \ for the percentage\n   of SLO violations that must be detected, i.e., a target\
    \ for the ratio\n   between the number of detected SLO violations and the number\
    \ of total\n   SLO violations that are actually occurring (some of which might\
    \ go\n   undetected).  In that case, the solution will aim to minimize the\n \
    \  resources spent (i.e., the amount of test traffic and number of\n   measurement\
    \ sessions) that are required to achieve that target.\n"

  - "7.  Implementation Considerations\n   The active measurement model assumes that\
    \ a typical infrastructure\n   will have multiple network segments, multiple Autonomous\
    \ Systems\n   (ASes), and a reasonably large number of routers.  It also considers\n\
    \   that multiple SLOs can be in place at a given time.  Since\n   interoperability\
    \ in a heterogeneous network is a goal, features found\n   on different active\
    \ measurement mechanisms (e.g., OWAMP, TWAMP, and\n   Cisco Service Level Assurance\
    \ Protocol) and device programmability\n   interfaces (such as Juniper's Junos\
    \ API or Cisco's Embedded Event\n   Manager) could be used for the implementation.\
    \  The autonomic\n   solution should include and/or reference specific algorithms,\n\
    \   protocols, metrics, and technologies for the implementation of\n   distributed\
    \ detection of SLA violations as a whole.\n   Finally, it should be noted that\
    \ there are multiple deployment\n   scenarios, including deployment scenarios\
    \ that involve physical\n   devices hosting autonomic functions or virtualized\
    \ infrastructure\n   hosting the same.  Co-deployment in conjunction with Virtual\
    \ Network\n   Functions (VNFs) is a possibility for further study.\n"
- title: 7.1.  Device-Based Self-Knowledge and Decisions
  contents:
  - "7.1.  Device-Based Self-Knowledge and Decisions\n   Each device has self-knowledge\
    \ about the local SLA monitoring.  This\n   could be in the form of historical\
    \ measurement data and SLOs.\n   Besides that, the devices would have algorithms\
    \ that could decide\n   which probes should be activated at a given time.  The\
    \ choice of\n   which algorithm is better for a specific situation would be also\n\
    \   autonomic.\n"
- title: 7.2.  Interaction with Other Devices
  contents:
  - "7.2.  Interaction with Other Devices\n   Network devices should share information\
    \ about service-level\n   measurement results.  This information can speed up\
    \ the detection of\n   SLA violations and increase the number of detected SLA\
    \ violations.\n   For example, if one device detects that a remote destination\
    \ is in\n   danger of violating an SLO, other devices may conduct additional\n\
    \   measurements to the same destination or other destinations in its\n   proximity.\
    \  For any given network device, the exchange of data may be\n   more important\
    \ with some devices (for example, devices in the same\n   network neighborhood\
    \ or devices that are \"correlated\" by some other\n   means) than with others.\
    \  Defining the network devices that exchange\n   measurement data (i.e., management\
    \ peers) creates a new topology.\n   Different approaches could be used to define\
    \ this topology (e.g.,\n   correlated peers [P2PBNM-Nobre-2012]).  To bootstrap\
    \ peer selection,\n   each device should use its known neighbors (e.g., FIB and\
    \ RIB tables)\n   as initial seeds to identify possible peers.  It should be noted\
    \ that\n   a solution will benefit if topology information and network discovery\n\
    \   functions are provided by the underlying autonomic framework.  A\n   solution\
    \ will need to be able to discover measurement peers as well\n   as measurement\
    \ targets, specifically measurement targets that support\n   active measurement\
    \ responders and that will be able to respond to\n   measurement requests and\
    \ reflect measurement traffic as needed.\n"

  - "8.  Comparison with Current Solutions\n   There is no standardized solution for\
    \ distributed autonomic detection\n   of SLA violations.  Current solutions are\
    \ restricted to ad hoc\n   scripts running on a per-node fashion to automate some\
    \ administrator\n   actions.  There are some proposals for passive probe activation\n\
    \   (e.g., DECON [DECON] and CSAMP [CSAMP]), but these do not focus on\n   autonomic\
    \ features.\n"

  - "9.  Related IETF Work\n   This section discusses related IETF work and is provided\
    \ for\n   reference.  This section is not exhaustive; rather, it provides an\n\
    \   overview of the various initiatives and how they relate to autonomic\n   distributed\
    \ detection of SLA violations.\n   1.  LMAP: The Large-Scale Measurement of Broadband\
    \ Performance\n       Working Group standardizes the LMAP measurement system for\n\
    \       performance management of broadband access devices.  The\n       autonomic\
    \ solution could be relevant to LMAP because it deploys\n       measurement probes\
    \ and could be used for screening for SLA\n       violations.  Besides that, a\
    \ solution to decrease the workload of\n       human administrators in service\
    \ providers is probably highly\n       desirable.\n   2.  IPFIX: IP Flow Information\
    \ Export (IPFIX) Working Group (now\n       concluded) aimed to standardize IP\
    \ flows (i.e., netflows).  IPFIX\n       uses measurement probes (i.e., metering\
    \ exporters) to gather flow\n       data.  In this context, the autonomic solution\
    \ for the activation\n       of active measurement probes could possibly be extended\
    \ to also\n       address passive measurement probes.  Besides that, flow\n  \
    \     information could be used in making decisions regarding probe\n       activation.\n\
    \   3.  ALTO: The Application-Layer Traffic Optimization Working Group\n     \
    \  aims to provide topological information at a higher abstraction\n       layer,\
    \ which can be based upon network policy, and with\n       application-relevant\
    \ service functions located in it.  Their work\n       could be leveraged to define\
    \ the topology for network devices\n       that exchange measurement data.\n"

  - "11.  Security Considerations\n   The security of this solution hinges on the\
    \ security of the network\n   underlay, i.e., the Autonomic Control Plane.  If\
    \ the Autonomic\n   Control Plane were to be compromised, an attacker could undermine\
    \ the\n   effectiveness of measurement coordination by reporting fraudulent\n\
    \   measurement results to peers.  This would cause measurement probes to\n  \
    \ be deployed in an ineffective manner that would increase the\n   likelihood\
    \ that violations of SLOs go undetected.\n   Likewise, the security of the solution\
    \ hinges on the security of the\n   deployment mechanism for autonomic functions\
    \ (in this case, the\n   autonomic function that conducts the service-level measurements).\
    \  If\n   an attacker were able to hijack an autonomic function, it could try\n\
    \   to exhaust or exceed the resources that should be spent on autonomic\n   measurements\
    \ in order to deplete network resources, including network\n   bandwidth due to\
    \ higher-than-necessary volumes of synthetic test\n   traffic generated by measurement\
    \ probes.  Again, it could also lead\n   to reporting of misleading results; among\
    \ other things, this could\n   result in non-optimal selection of measurement\
    \ targets and, in turn,\n   an increase in the likelihood that service-level violations\
    \ go\n   undetected.\n"
