    \ the documents that describe the current\n   Internet-Standard Management Framework,\
    \ please refer to section 7 of\n   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].\n   Managed objects are\
    \ accessed via a virtual information store, termed\n   the Management Information\
    \ Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally\n   accessed through the Simple Network\
    \ Management Protocol (SNMP).\n   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms\
    \ defined in the\n   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies\
    \ a MIB\n   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,\n\
    \   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580\n   [RFC2580].\n"
- title: 3.  Short Overview of Fibre Channel
  contents:
  - "3.  Short Overview of Fibre Channel\n   The Fibre Channel (FC) is logically a\
    \ bidirectional point-to-point\n   serial data channel, structured for high performance.\
    \  Fibre Channel\n   provides a general transport vehicle for higher-level protocols\
    \ such\n   as Small Computer System Interface (SCSI) command sets, the High-\n\
    \   Performance Parallel Interface (HIPPI) data framing, IP (Internet\n   Protocol),\
    \ IEEE 802.2, and others.\n   Physically, Fibre Channel is an interconnection\
    \ of multiple\n   communication points, called N_Ports, interconnected either\
    \ by a\n   switching network, called a Fabric, or by a point-to-point link.  A\n\
    \   Fibre Channel \"node\" consists of one or more N_Ports.  A Fabric may\n  \
    \ consist of multiple Interconnect Elements, some of which are\n   switches. \
    \ An N_Port connects to the Fabric via a port on a switch\n   called an F_Port.\
    \  When multiple FC nodes are connected to a single\n   port on a switch via an\
    \ \"Arbitrated Loop\" topology, the switch port\n   is called an FL_Port, and\
    \ the nodes' ports are called NL_Ports.  The\n   term Nx_Port is used to refer\
    \ to either an N_Port or an NL_Port.  The\n   term Fx_Port is used to refer to\
    \ either an F_Port or an FL_Port.  A\n   switch port, which is interconnected\
    \ to another switch port via an\n   Inter-Switch Link (ISL), is called an E_Port.\
    \  A B_Port connects a\n   bridge device with an E_Port on a switch; a B_Port\
    \ provides a subset\n   of E_Port functionality.\n   Many Fibre Channel components,\
    \ including the Fabric, each node, and\n   most ports, have globally-unique names.\
    \  These globally-unique names\n   are typically formatted as World Wide Names\
    \ (WWNs).  More information\n   on WWNs can be found in [FC-FS].  WWNs are expected\
    \ to be persistent\n   across agent and unit resets.\n   Fibre Channel frames\
    \ contain 24-bit address identifiers, which\n   identify the frame's source and\
    \ destination ports.  Each FC port has\n   both an address identifier and a WWN.\
    \  When a fabric is in use, the\n   FC address identifiers are dynamic and are\
    \ assigned by a switch.\n   Each octet of a 24-bit address represents a level\
    \ in an address\n   hierarchy, with a Domain_ID being the highest level of the\
    \ hierarchy.\n   The Fibre Channel Name Server provides a way for N_Ports and\
    \ NL_Ports\n   to register and discover Fibre Channel attributes.  Such attributes\n\
    \   include names, addresses, types, features, etc., at various protocol\n   layers,\
    \ including upper layer protocols specific to Fibre Channel\n   (which are sometimes\
    \ called \"FC-4s\").  Communication with the Name\n   Server is via Fibre Channel's\
    \ CT (Common Transport for Generic\n   Services) using \"Information Units\" (called\
    \ CT_IUs) as either\n   requests, responses, or unsolicited.\n   Registrations\
    \ may be performed by a third party.  However, the Name\n   Server may refuse\
    \ such third-party registration for unspecified\n   reasons.  Once registered,\
    \ the attributes are made available to\n   requestors.\n   Requestors could learn\
    \ about new registrations via periodic polling\n   of the Name Server, but such\
    \ polling would generate a considerable\n   overhead.  To avoid this overhead,\
    \ the Registered State Change\n   Notification (RSCN) mechanism defined in FC-FS\
    \ [FC-FS] allows an\n   Nx_Port to register to receive an RSCN whenever an event\
    \ occurs that\n   may affect the state of other Nx_Port(s), including changes\
    \ in the\n   information registered with the Name Server.\n   The Fibre Channel\
    \ Name Server is defined in the FC-GS specification,\n   The latest specification\
    \ is [FC-GS-4]; the previous version was\n   [FC-GS-3].\n"
- title: 4.  Relationship to Other MIBs
  contents:
  - "4.  Relationship to Other MIBs\n   The first standardized MIB for Fibre Channel\
    \ [RFC2837] was focused on\n   Fibre Channel switches.  It was obsoleted by the\
    \ more generic Fibre\n   Channel Management MIB [FC-MGMT], which defines basic\
    \ information for\n   Fibre Channel hosts and switches, including extensions to\
    \ the\n   standard IF-MIB [IF-MIB] for Fibre Channel interfaces.\n   This MIB\
    \ extends beyond [FC-MGMT] to cover the functionality, in\n   Fibre Channel switches,\
    \ of providing Fibre Channel's Name Server\n   function.\n   This MIB also imports\
    \ some common textual conventions from\n   T11-TC-MIB, defined in [FC-FAM-MIB].\n"
- title: 5.  MIB Overview
  contents:
  - "5.  MIB Overview\n   This MIB module provides the means for monitoring the operation\
    \ of,\n   and configuring some parameters of, one or more instances of Fibre\n\
    \   Channel Name Server functionality.  (Note that there are no\n   definitions\
    \ in this MIB module of \"managed actions\" that can be\n   invoked via SNMP.)\n"
- title: 5.1.  Fibre Channel Management Instance
  contents:
  - "5.1.  Fibre Channel Management Instance\n   A Fibre Channel management instance\
    \ is defined in [FC-MGMT] as a\n   separable managed instance of Fibre Channel\
    \ functionality.  Fibre\n   Channel functionality may be grouped into Fibre Channel\
    \ management\n   instances in whatever way is most convenient for the\n   implementation(s).\
    \  For example, one such grouping accommodates a\n   single SNMP agent having\
    \ multiple AgentX [RFC2741] sub-agents, with\n   each sub-agent implementing a\
    \ different Fibre Channel management\n   instance.\n   The object, fcmInstanceIndex,\
    \ is IMPORTed from the FC-MGMT-MIB\n   [FC-MGMT] as the index value to uniquely\
    \ identify each Fibre Channel\n   management instance within the same SNMP context\
    \ ([RFC3411], section\n   3.3.1).\n"
- title: 5.2.  Name Server Information Subset
  contents:
  - "5.2.  Name Server Information Subset\n   In addition to allowing for multiple\
    \ Fibre Channel management\n   instances, this MIB is based on the notion that\
    \ the information\n   registered with the Name Server is available as one or more\
    \ subsets.\n   The MIB allows the different subsets to be accessed either:\n \
    \     - via different SNMP agents/contexts,\n      - via different Fibre Channel\
    \ management instances within the\n        same SNMP agent/context, and/or\n \
    \     - via the same Fibre Channel management instance within the\n        same\
    \ SNMP agent/context.\n   The union of these subsets (across all agents/contexts\
    \ in the\n   network) represents the total set of information registered with\
    \ the\n   Name Server.  Note that the intersection of the subsets is often\n \
    \  non-empty, and the use of the term \"subset\" does not preclude any\n   subset\
    \ from containing the complete set of Name Server information.\n   Each of these\
    \ subsets is identified using an index value called a\n   Name Server Information\
    \ Subset Index.\n   Thus, all objects in this MIB are in tables that are INDEXed\
    \ by at\n   least fcmInstanceIndex and t11NsInfoSubsetIndex, where the latter\n\
    \   contains a Name Server Information Subset Index value.\n"
- title: 5.3.  Fabric Index
  contents:
  - "5.3.  Fabric Index\n   The [FC-SW-3] standard for an interconnecting Fabric consisting\
    \ of\n   multiple Fabric Switch elements describes the operation of a single\n\
    \   Fabric in a physical infrastructure.  The current [FC-SW-4] standard\n   also\
    \ supports the operation of multiple Virtual Fabrics operating\n   within one\
    \ (or more) physical infrastructures.  In such a scenario,\n   each Fabric has,\
    \ of course, its own management instrumentation.  In\n   order to accommodate\
    \ this scenario, this MIB module defines all\n   Fabric-related information in\
    \ tables that are INDEXed by an arbitrary\n   integer, named a \"Fabric Index\"\
    .  In a Fabric that is conformant to\n   [FC-SW-3], the value of this Fabric Index\
    \ will always be 1.\n"
- title: 5.4.  The MIB Groups
  contents:
  - "5.4.  The MIB Groups\n   This section describes the six MIB groups contained\
    \ in the MIB.\n"
- title: 5.4.1.  The t11NsDBGroup Group
  contents:
  - "5.4.1.  The t11NsDBGroup Group\n   This group contains information about the\
    \ operation of the Name\n   Server function acting upon a Name Server Information\
    \ Subset,\n   including an indication of whether such operation is performed local\n\
    \   to a particular Fibre Channel switch, or independently of a Fibre\n   Channel\
    \ switch.  It also contains the information currently\n   registered in a particular\
    \ Name Server Information Subset.\n"
- title: 5.4.2.  Three Statistics Groups
  contents:
  - "5.4.2.  Three Statistics Groups\n   There are three groups of Name Server statistics\
    \ objects:\n        t11NsRequestStatsGroup -- stats about requests\n        t11NsRscnStatsGroup\
    \    -- stats about (Name Server) RSCNs\n        t11NsRejectStatsGroup  -- stats\
    \ about rejects\n   Each of these groups is conditionally mandatory; specifically,\
    \ each\n   group contains objects for particular statistics such that\n   implementation\
    \ of the group is mandatory only for an implementation\n   that counts/captures\
    \ the group's particular statistics.\n   The intent here is not to force implementations\
    \ to capture these\n   statistics, but rather to have all implementations that\
    \ do capture\n   them, provide access to them via the same MIB objects.\n"
- title: 5.4.3.  The t11NsNotifyGroup Group
  contents:
  - "5.4.3.  The t11NsNotifyGroup Group\n   This group contains a set of notifications\
    \ that provide for\n   monitoring the rejections of Name Server Registration Requests.\n"
- title: 5.4.4.  The t11NsNotifyControlGroup Group
  contents:
  - "5.4.4.  The t11NsNotifyControlGroup Group\n   This group contains objects for\
    \ controlling the generation of, and\n   for information to be included in, the\
    \ notifications defined in the\n   t11NsNotifyGroup group.\n"
- title: 5.5.  The Actual Values of Objects
  contents:
  - "5.5.  The Actual Values of Objects\n   The objects defined in the t11NsRegTable\
    \ represent the values\n   registered with the Name Server.  The SNMP agent MUST\
    \ report the\n   actual values, even if they are incorrectly formatted.  This\
    \ is the\n   reason why, for example, the two objects that represent IP addresses,\n\
    \   t11NsNodeIpAddress and t11NsPortIpAddress, have the SYNTAX of OCTET\n   STRING,\
    \ so that they are able to represent invalid values (which\n   could not be represented\
    \ using InetAddressType and InetAddress).\n   Similarly, each set of (t11NsRejectReasonCode,\
    \ t11NsRejReasonCodeExp,\n   t11NsRejReasonVendorCode) objects must hold the values\
    \ of the actual\n   reject, explanation, and vendor-specific codes that were present\
    \ in\n   the generated Reject message (the \"Reject CT_IU\"), irrespective of\n\
    \   whether or not such code values were appropriate.\n"

  contents:
  - "11.  Security Considerations\n   There is one management object defined in this\
    \ MIB module with a\n   MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such\
    \ objects may\n   be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.\n\
    \   The support for SET operations in a non-secure environment without\n   proper\
    \ protection can have a negative effect on network operations.\n   This object\
    \ and its sensitivity/vulnerability is:\n      t11NsInfoSubsetRejReqNotfyEnable\
    \ -- the ability to enable/disable\n                                         \
    \ notifications.\n   Such objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in\
    \ some\n   network environments.  For example, the ability to change network\n\
    \   topology or network speed may afford an attacker the ability to\n   obtain\
    \ better performance at the expense of other network users.  The\n   support for\
    \ SET operations in a non-secure environment without proper\n   protection can\
    \ have a negative effect on network operations.\n   Some of the readable objects\
    \ in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a\n   MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible)\
    \ may be considered sensitive or\n   vulnerable in some network environments.\
    \  It is thus important to\n   control even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these\
    \ objects and possibly\n   to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending\
    \ them over\n   the network via SNMP.  These are the tables and objects and their\n\
    \   sensitivity/vulnerability:\n      t11NsRegTable -- contains information about\
    \ registered Nx_Ports.\n      t11NsStatsTable -- contains statistics and state\
    \ information about\n                         the Name Server.\n   SNMP versions\
    \ prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.\n   Even if the network itself\
    \ is secure (for example by using IPsec),\n   even then, there is no control as\
    \ to who on the secure network is\n   allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete)\
    \ the objects\n   in this MIB module.\n   It is RECOMMENDED that implementors\
    \ consider the security features as\n   provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see\
    \ [RFC3410], section 8),\n   including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic\
