- title: 2. HTTP Servers and Clients
  contents:
  - "2. HTTP Servers and Clients\n   The structure of IOTP maps on to the structure\
    \ of HTTP in the\n   following way:\n      The merchant, payment handler, delivery\
    \ handler, and customer care\n      roles are all represented by HTTP servers.\
    \  Each may be\n      represented by a separate server, or they may be combined\
    \ in any\n      combination.\n      The consumer role is represented by an HTTP\
    \ client.\n   Note: A Merchant, may act in the role of a consumer, for example\
    \ to\n   deposit electronic cash.  In this case the Merchant, as an\n   organization\
    \ rather than as a role, would need to be supported by an\n   HTTP client.\n"
- title: 3. HTTP Net Locations
  contents:
  - "3. HTTP Net Locations\n   The Net Locations contained within the IOTP specification\
    \ are all\n   URIs [RFC 2396].  If a secure connection is required or desired\
    \ a\n   secure channel that both the HTTP Server and Client support MUST be\n\
    \   used. Examples of such channels are SSL version 3 or TLS [RFC 2246].\n"
- title: 4. Consumer Clients
  contents:
  - "4. Consumer Clients\n   In most environments, the consumer agent will initially\
    \ be an HTML\n   browser.  However, current browsers do not provide the needed\n\
    \   capability to act as an agent for the consumer for an IOTP\n   transaction.\
    \ This leads to two requirements:\n   a method of starting and passing control\
    \ to the IOTP client, and\n   a method of closing down the IOTP client cleanly\
    \ and passing control\n   back to the HTML browser once the IOTP Transaction has\
    \ finished.\n"
- title: 4.1 Starting the IOTP Client and the Merchant IOTP Server
  contents:
  - "4.1 Starting the IOTP Client and the Merchant IOTP Server\n   At some point,\
    \ the HTTP client at the consumer will send an HTTP\n   request that is interpreted\
    \ as an \"IOTP Startup Request\" by the\n   Merchant HTTP server.  This might,\
    \ for example, be the result of\n   clicking on a \"pay\" button.  This message\
    \ is a stand-in for a request\n   message of some form and the Merchant Server\
    \ will respond with the\n   first IOTP Message in the form of an XML document.\n\
    \   The MIME type for all IOTP messages is: \"APPLICATION/IOTP\"; however\n  \
    \ \"APPLICATION/X-IOTP\" has been in use for experimentation and\n   development\
    \ and SHOULD also be recognized.  See section 7 below for\n   the MIME type registration\
    \ template for APPLICATION/IOTP.  Because\n   HTTP is binary clean, no content-transfer-encoding\
    \ is required.  (See\n   [RFC 2376] re the application/xml type which has some\
    \ similar\n   considerations.)\n   This HTTP response will be interpreted by the\
    \ HTML browser as a\n   request to start the application associated with MIME\
    \ type\n   \"APPLICATION/IOTP\", and to pass the content of this message to that\n\
    \   application.\n   At this point, the IOTP client will be started and have the\
    \ first\n   message.\n   IOTP messages are short-lived. Therefore, the HTTP server\
    \ SHOULD\n   avoid having its responses cached.  In HTTP V1.0, the \"nocache\"\
    \n   pragma can be used.  This can be neglected on SSL/TLS secured\n   connections\
    \ which are not cached and on HTTP POST requests in HTTP\n   v1.1 as in v1.1 POST\
    \ responses are not cached.\n"
- title: 4.2 Ongoing IOTP Messages
  contents:
  - "4.2 Ongoing IOTP Messages\n   Data from earlier IOTP Messages in a transaction\
    \ MUST be retained by\n   the IOTP Client so that it may (1) be copied to make\
    \ up part of later\n   IOTP messages, (2) used in calculations to verify signatures\
    \ in later\n   IOTP message, (3) be resent in some cases where a request has timed\n\
    \   out without response, (4) used as input to the Customer Care role in\n   later\
    \ versions of IOTP, etc.  The way in which the data is copied\n   depends on the\
    \ IOTP Transaction.  The data MUST be retained until the\n   end of the transaction,\
    \ whether by success, failure, or cancelation,\n   and as long thereafter as it\
    \ is desired for any of the parties to\n   inquire into it.\n   The IOTP messages\
    \ contain Net Locations (e.g. the PayReqNetLocn)\n   which for HTTP will contain\
    \ the URIs to which the IOTP client MUST\n   send IOTP messages.\n   Subsequent\
    \ IOTP messages (XML documents) will be sent using the POST\n   function of HTTP.\
    \  The HTTP client MUST perform full HTTP POST\n   requests.\n   The XML documents\
    \ MUST be sent in a manner compatible with the\n   external encodings allowed\
    \ by the XML [XML] specification.\n"
- title: 4.3 Stopping an IOTP Transaction
  contents:
  - "4.3 Stopping an IOTP Transaction\n   The following should be read in conjunction\
    \ with [RFC 2801].\n   An IOTP Transaction is complete when\n   -- the IOTP client\
    \ decides to fail the IOTP Transaction for some\n      reason either by canceling\
    \ the transaction or as a result of\n      discovering an error in an IOTP message\
    \ received, or\n   -- a \"time out\" occurs or a connection fails, e.g. a response\
    \ to an\n      IOTP Message, has not been received after some user-defined period\n\
    \      of Time (including retransmissions).\n   An IOTP Client which processes\
    \ an IOTP Transaction which:\n   -- completes successfully (i.e. it has not received\
    \ an Error Block\n      with a HardError or a Cancel Block) MUST direct the browser\
    \ to the\n      Net Location specified in SuccessNetLocn in the Protocol Options\n\
    \      Component, i.e., cause it to do an HTTP GET with that URL.\n   -- does\
    \ not complete successfully, because it has received some Error\n      Trading\
    \ Block, MUST display the information in the Error Message,\n      stop the transaction,\
    \ and pass control to the browser so that it\n      will do a GET on the Error\
    \ Net Location specified for the role\n      from which the error was received.\n\
    \   -- is cancelled since a Cancel Block has been received, MUST stop the\n  \
    \    IOTP Transaction and hand control to the browser so that it will\n      do\
    \ a GET on the on the Cancel Net Location specified for the role\n      from which\
    \ the Cancel Block was received.\n   -- is in error because an IOTP Message does\
    \ not conform to this\n      specification, MUST send an IOTP Message containing\
    \ a Error\n      Trading Block to role from which the erroneous message was\n\
    \      received and the ErrorLogNetLoc specified for that role, stop the\n   \
    \   IOTP Transaction, and hand control to the browser so that it will\n      do\
    \ a GET from the Error Net Location specified for the role from\n      which the\
    \ bad message was received.\n   -- has a \"time out\", MUST display a message\
    \ describing the time out.\n      May give the user the option of cancelling or\
    \ retrying and/or may\n      automatically retry.  On failure due to time out,\
    \ treat as an\n      error above.\n   Each implementation of an IOTP client may\
    \ decide whether or not to\n   terminate the IOTP Client application immediately\
    \ upon completing an\n   IOTP Transaction or whether to wait until it is closed\
    \ down as a\n   result of, for example, user shut down or browser shut down.\n"
- title: 5. Starting the Payment handler and Deliverer IOTP Servers
  contents:
  - "5. Starting the Payment handler and Deliverer IOTP Servers\n   Payment Handler\
    \ and Deliverer IOTP Servers are started by receiving\n   an IOTP Message which\
    \ contains:\n   -- for a Payment handler, a Payment Request Block, and\n   --\
    \ for a Delivery Handler, a Delivery Request Block\n"
- title: 6. Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "6. Security Considerations\n   Security of Internet Open Trade Protocol messages\
    \ is primarily\n   dependent on signatures within IOTP as described in [RFC 2801]\
    \ and\n   [RFC 2802].  Privacy protection for IOTP interactions can be obtained\n\
    \   by using a secure channel for IOTP messages, such as SSL/TLS [RFC\n   2246].\n\
    \   Note that the security of payment protocols transported by IOTP is\n   the\
    \ responsibility of those payment protocols, NOT of IOTP.\n"
- title: 7. IANA Considerations
  contents:
  - "7. IANA Considerations\n   This specification defines the APPLICATION/IOTP MIME\
    \ type.  The\n   registration template is as follows [RFC 2048]:\n      To: ietf-types@iana.org\n\
    \      Subject: Registration of MIME media type APPLICATION/IOTP\n      MIME media\
    \ type name: APPLICATION\n      MIME subtype name: IOTP\n      Required parameters:\
    \ (none)\n      Optional parameters: charset - see RFC 2376\n      Encoding considerations:\
    \ Content is XML and may in some cases\n      require quoted printable or base64\
    \ encoding.  However, no encoding\n      is required for HTTP transport which\
    \ is expected to be common.\n      Security considerations: IOTP includes provisions\
    \ for digital\n      authentication but for confidentiality, other mechanisms\
    \ such as\n      TLS should be used.  See RFC 2801 and RFC 2802.\n      Interoperability\
    \ considerations: See RFC 2801.\n      Published specification: See RFC 2801 and\
    \ RFC 2802.\n      Applications which use this media type:  Internet Open Trading\n\
