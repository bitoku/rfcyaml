  contents:
  - "Abstract\n   This document specifies the telnet Uniform Resource Identifier (URI)\n\
    \   scheme that was originally specified in RFC 1738.  The purpose of\n   this\
    \ document is to allow RFC 1738 to be made obsolete while keeping\n   the information\
    \ about the scheme on standards track.\n"
- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   URIs were previously defined in [RFC2396], which was updated\
    \ by\n   [RFC3986].  Those documents also specify how to define schemes for\n\
    \   URIs.\n   The first definition for many URI schemes appeared in [RFC1738].\n\
    \   Because that document has been made obsolete, this document copies\n   the\
    \ telnet URI scheme from it to allow that material to remain on\n   standards\
    \ track.\n"
- title: 2.  Scheme Definition
  contents:
  - "2.  Scheme Definition\n   The Telnet URL scheme is used to designate interactive\
    \ services that\n   may be accessed by the Telnet protocol [STD8].\n   A telnet\
    \ URL takes the form:\n   telnet://<user>:<password>@<host>:<port>/\n   The final\
    \ \"/\" character may be omitted.  If :<port> is omitted, the\n   port defaults\
    \ to 23.  The :<password> can be omitted, as well as the\n   whole <user>:<password>\
    \ part.  Few implementations handle the user\n   name and password very well,\
    \ if at all.\n   This URL does not designate a data object, but rather an interactive\n\
    \   service.  Remote interactive services vary widely in the means by\n   which\
    \ they allow remote logins; in practice, the <user> and\n   <password> supplied\
    \ are advisory only: clients accessing a telnet URL\n   merely advise the user\
    \ of the suggested username and password.\n   Many RFCs have added various services\
    \ to the Telnet protocol for\n   better authentication, encryption of traffic,\
    \ or both.  Those RFCs\n   have not specified new URI schemes for Telnet to invoke\
    \ those\n   services (along the lines of \"https\" being a different URI scheme\n\
    \   from \"http\").  Some modern telnet clients attempt to invoke those\n   more-secure\
    \ versions of Telnet when resolving a \"telnet\" URL.\n"
- title: 3.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "3.  Security Considerations\n   There are many security considerations for URI\
    \ schemes discussed in\n   [RFC3986].\n   The Telnet protocol normally uses passwords\
    \ in the clear for\n   authentication, and normally offers no privacy.  In normal\
    \ telnet,\n   both the user's identity and their password are exposed without\
    \ any\n   protection; after that, the contents of the entire Telnet session is\n\
    \   exposed without any protection.\n   Many extensions have been made to Telnet\
    \ to make it more secure in\n   different ways.  In particular, [RFC2941] gives\
    \ a framework based on\n   a telnet option that many other security extensions\
    \ have leveraged\n   off of.  These extensions are certainly worthwhile methods\
    \ for\n   reducing the obvious problems with exposing the user's name,\n   password,\
    \ and plaintext of the session in the clear.\n   Although some modern telnet clients\
    \ attempt to invoke those more-\n   secure versions of Telnet when resolving a\
    \ \"telnet\" URL, other telnet\n   clients do not, so a user cannot rely on this\
    \ type of security unless\n   it is explicitly enabled and the results of the\
    \ security negotiation\n   are checked.\n"
