  - "Abstract\n   This document defines a mechanism to enable in-band transmission
    of\n   Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) responses in the Kerberos\n   network
    authentication protocol.  These responses are used to verify\n   the validity
    of the certificates used in Public Key Cryptography for\n   Initial Authentication
    in Kerberos (PKINIT), which is the Kerberos\n   Version 5 extension that provides
    for the use of public key\n   cryptography.\n"

  - "1.  Introduction\n   Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) [RFC2560] enables\n
    \  applications to obtain timely information regarding the revocation\n   status
    of a certificate.  Because OCSP responses are well bounded and\n   small in size,
    constrained clients may wish to use OCSP to check the\n   validity of the certificates
    for Kerberos Key Distribution Center\n   (KDC) in order to avoid transmission
    of large Certificate Revocation\n   Lists (CRLs) and therefore save bandwidth
    on constrained networks\n   [OCSP-PROFILE].\n   This document defines a pre-authentication
    type [RFC4120], where the\n   client and the KDC MAY piggyback OCSP responses
    for certificates used\n   in authentication exchanges, as defined in [RFC4556].\n
    \  By using this OPTIONAL extension, PKINIT clients and the KDC can\n   maximize
    the reuse of cached OCSP responses.\n"

  - "3.  Message Definition\n   A pre-authentication type identifier is defined for
    this mechanism:\n              PA-PK-OCSP-RESPONSE              18\n   The corresponding
    padata-value field [RFC4120] contains the DER [X60]\n   encoding of the following
    ASN.1 type:\n          PKOcspData ::= SEQUENCE OF OcspResponse\n                         --
    If more than one OcspResponse is\n                         -- included, the first
    OcspResponse\n                         -- MUST contain the OCSP response\n                         --
    for the signer's certificate.\n                         -- The signer refers to
    the client for\n                         -- AS-REQ, and the KDC for the AS-REP,\n
    \                        -- respectively.\n          OcspResponse ::= OCTET STRING\n
    \                        -- Contains a complete OCSP response,\n                         --
    as defined in [RFC2560].\n   The client MAY send OCSP responses for certificates
    used in PA-PK-\n   AS-REQ [RFC4556] via a PA-PK-OCSP-RESPONSE.\n   The KDC that
    receives a PA-PK-OCSP-RESPONSE SHOULD send a PA-PK-\n   OCSP-RESPONSE containing
    OCSP responses for certificates used in the\n   KDC's PA-PK-AS-REP.  The client
    can request a PA-PK-OCSP-RESPONSE by\n   using a PKOcspData containing an empty
    sequence.\n   The KDC MAY send a PA-PK-OCSP-RESPONSE when it does not receive
    a\n   PA-PK-OCSP-RESPONSE from the client.\n   The PA-PK-OCSP-RESPONSE sent by
    the KDC contains OCSP responses for\n   certificates used in PA-PK-AS-REP [RFC4556].\n
    \  Note the lack of integrity protection for the empty or missing OCSP\n   response;
    lack of an expected OCSP response from the KDC for the\n   KDC's certificates
    SHOULD be treated as an error by the client,\n   unless it is configured otherwise.\n
    \  When using OCSP, the response is signed by the OCSP server, which is\n   trusted
    by the receiver.  Depending on local policy, further\n   verification of the validity
    of the OCSP servers may be needed\n   The client and the KDC SHOULD ignore invalid
    OCSP responses received\n   via this mechanism, and they MAY implement CRL processing
    logic as a\n   fall-back position, if the OCSP responses received via this mechanism\n
    \  alone are not sufficient for the verification of certificate\n   validity.
    \ The client and/or the KDC MAY ignore a valid OCSP response\n   and perform its
    own revocation status verification independently.\n"

  - "4.  Security Considerations\n   The pre-authentication data in this document
    do not actually\n   authenticate any principals, but are designed to be used in\n
    \  conjunction with PKINIT.\n   There is no binding between PA-PK-OCSP-RESPONSE
    pre-authentication\n   data and PKINIT pre-authentication data other than a given
    OCSP\n   response corresponding to a certificate used in a PKINIT pre-\n   authentication
    data element.  Attacks involving removal or\n   replacement of PA-PK-OCSP-RESPONSE
    pre-authentication data elements\n   are, at worst, downgrade attacks, where a
    PKINIT client or KDC would\n   proceed without use of CRLs or OCSP for certificate
    validation, or\n   denial-of-service attacks, where a PKINIT client or KDC that
    cannot\n   validate the other's certificate without an accompanying OCSP\n   response
    might reject the AS exchange or might have to download very\n   large CRLs in
    order to continue.  Kerberos V does not protect against\n   denial-of-service
    attacks; therefore, the denial-of-service aspect of\n   these attacks is acceptable.\n
    \  If a PKINIT client or KDC cannot validate certificates without the\n   aid
    of a valid PA-PK-OCSP-RESPONSE, then it SHOULD fail the AS\n   exchange, possibly
    according to local configuration.\n"
