Abstract This memo defines the Management Information Base (MIB) for use with network management protocols in TCP/IP based internets.
In particular, it describes managed objects used for managing the Mobile Node, Foreign Agent and Home Agent of the Mobile IP Protocol.
The SNMP Network Management Framework
The Internet standard Network Management Framework presently consists of three major components.
The SMI, described in RFC 1902
[1] the mechanisms used for describing and naming objects for the purpose of management.
The MIB II, STD 17, RFC 1213
[2] the core set of managed objects for the Internet suite of protocols.
The protocol, RFC 1157 [3] and/or RFC 1905 [4], the protocol for accessing managed objects.
The Framework permits new objects to be defined for the purpose of experimentation and evaluation.
Object Definitions Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed the Management Information Base or MIB.
Objects in the MIB are defined using the subset of Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1) defined in the SMI.
In particular, each object type is named by an OBJECT IDENTIFIER, an administratively assigned name.
The object type together with an object instance serves to uniquely identify a specific instantiation of the object.
For human convenience, we often use a textual string, termed the descriptor, to refer to the object type.
To be consistent with IAB directives and good engineering practice, the authors have applied some criteria to select managed objects for the Mobile IP Protocol.
(1)  Partition management functionality among the Mobile Node, Home Agent, and Foreign Agent according to the partitioning seen in the Mobile IP Protocol.
(2)  Require that objects be essential for either fault or configuration management.
(3)  Limit the total number of objects.
(4)  Exclude objects which are simply derivable from others in this or other MIBs.
Structure of the Mobile IP
This section describes the basic model of Mobile IP used in developing the Mobile IP MIB.
This information should be useful to the implementor in understanding some of the basic design decisions of the MIB.
The Mobile IP Protocol introduces these new funtional entities: Mobile Node A host or router that changes its point of attachment from one network or subnetwork to another.
A mobile node may change its location without losing connectivity and without changing its IP address; it may continue to communicate with other Internet nodes at any location using its (constant) IP address, assuming link  layer connectivity to a point of attachment is available.
Home Agent A router on a mobile node's home network which tunnels packets for delivery to the mobile node when it is away from home, and maintains current location information for the mobile node.
Foreign Agent A router on a mobile node's visited network which provides routing services to the mobile node while registered.
The foreign agent detunnels and delivers packets to the mobile node that were tunneled by the mobile node's home agent.
For datagrams sent by a mobile node, the foreign agent may serve as a default router for registered mobile nodes.
This document specifies the objects used in managing these entities; namely, the Mobile Node, the Home Agent, and the Foreign Agent. 3.3.
MIB Groups Objects in this MIB are arranged into groups.
Each group is organized as a set of related objects.

The Mobile IP MIB affords the network operator the ability to configure and control the Mobile IP links of a particular system, including the Mobile IP authentication protocols, and shared secret key.
This represents a security risk.
These risks are addressed in the following manners: (1)  All variables which represent a significant security risk are placed in separate MIB Groups.
By providing Agent Capability Statements, the implementor of the MIB may elect not to implement these groups.
The MIB allows the manager station to create the security association for Mobile IP entities.
However, the agent should always return 0 length octet string when the manager station retrieves the shared security key in the mipSecAssocTable.
In this way, the Mobile IP entities can prevent the key leaking from SNMP GET, GET NEXT, or GET BULK requests.
The MIB defines a trap for Mobile IP entities to send a notification to the manager station if there is a security violation.
In this way, the operator can notice the source of an intruder.
The MIB also defines a table to log the security violations in the Mobile IP entities.
The manager station can retrieve this log to analyze the security violation instances in the system.
Thus, in order to preserve the integrity, security and privacy of the Mobile IP security features, an implementation SHOULD allow access to this MIB only via SNMPv2 and with other security enhancement such as SNMPv2Sec.
The other way to access this information is in concert with the IP security protocols (IP Authentication Header and IP Encapsulating Security Payload).
