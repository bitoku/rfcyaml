  - "1.  Introduction\n   ENUM (E.164 Number Mapping, RFC 3761 [1]) is a technology
    that\n   transforms E.164 numbers (The International Public Telecommunication\n
    \  Numbering Plan, ITU-T Recommendation E.164 [2]) into domain names and\n   then
    uses DNS (Domain Name System, RFC 1034 [3]) delegation through\n   NS records
    and NAPTR records (Dynamic Delegation Discovery System\n   (DDDS) Part Three:
    The Domain Name System (DNS) Database, RFC 3403\n   [4]) to look up what services
    are available for a specific domain\n   name.\n   This document registers Enumservices
    according to the guidelines\n   given in RFC 3761 [1] to be used for provisioning
    in the services\n   field of a NAPTR [4] resource record to indicate the types
    of\n   functionality associated with an end point and/or telephone number.\n   The
    registration is defined within the DDDS (Dynamic Delegation\n   Discovery System
    [4][5][6][7][8]) hierarchy, for use with the \"E2U\"\n   DDDS Application defined
    in RFC 3761.\n   Number Portability allows telephone subscribers to keep their\n
    \  telephone numbers when they change service providers, move to a new\n   location,
    or change the subscribed services [14].  In many countries,\n   such as the United
    States and Canada, the functions of naming and\n   addressing on the Public Switched
    Telephone Network (PSTN) have been\n   abstracted.  In the case of a ported number,
    the dialed number is not\n   directly routable on the PSTN and must be translated
    into a routing\n   number for call completion.  Other numbers, which are not ported,
    and\n   which can be routed directly on the PSTN based on the dialed number,\n
    \  are typically assigned to carriers and other entities in large blocks\n   or
    pools.  Number Portability and other numbering information are\n   distributed
    in a variety of methods and formats around the world.\n   The Enumservices described
    here could enable service providers to\n   place ported numbers, pooled numbers,
    and blocks of numbers and their\n   associated PSTN contact information, into
    externally available or\n   highly locally cached ENUM databases.  This, in turn,
    could enable\n   such parties to consolidate all telephone number lookups in their\n
    \  networks into a single ENUM lookup, thereby simplifying call routing\n   and
    network operations, which would then result in either an on-net\n   (IP-based)
    response or an off-net (PSTN-based) response.\n   The following Enumservice is
    registered with this document: \"pstn\" to\n   indicate PSTN routing data, including
    number portability data, non-\n   ported telephone number data (individually or
    in number blocks), and\n   other PSTN-oriented data that is associated with E.164
    telephone\n   numbers.  The purpose of this Enumservice is to provide routing\n
    \  information for telephone numbers that do not designate an endpoint\n   resident
    on the public Internet or a private/peered Internet Protocol\n   (IP) network.
    \ Thus, these are numbers that are only routable via the\n   traditional PSTN,
    even if the call originates from an IP network.\n   The URIs returned in this
    service may use the TEL URI parameters\n   defined in RFC 4694 [10], and implementations
    must be prepared to\n   accept them.\n   The service parameters defined in RFC
    3761 indicate that a \"type\" and\n   a \"subtype\" may be specified.  Within
    this set of specifications, the\n   convention is assumed that the \"type\" (being
    the more generic term)\n   defines the service and the \"subtype\" defines the
    URI scheme.\n   When only one URI scheme is associated with a given service, it\n
    \  should be assumed that an additional URI scheme to be used with this\n   service
    may be added at a later time.  Thus, the subtype is needed to\n   identify the
    specific Enumservice intended.\n"

  - "2.  Distribution of Data\n   The distribution of number portability data is often
    highly\n   restricted, either by contract or regulation of a National Regulatory\n
    \  Authority (NRA); therefore, NAPTR records specified herein may or may\n   not
    be part of the e164.arpa DNS tree.\n   The authors believe that it is more likely
    that these records will be\n   distributed on a purely private basis.  Distribution
    of this NAPTR\n   data could be either (a) on a private basis (within a service\n
    \  provider's internal network, or on a private basis between one or\n   more
    parties using a variety of security mechanisms to prohibit\n   general public
    access), (b) openly available or, (c) distributed by\n   the relevant number portability
    organization or other industry\n   organization, but possibly on a national basis
    and subject to or in\n   accordance with national regulatory policy.\n   If such
    data were distributed nationally, the national telephone\n   numbering authority,
    or some other regulatory body or numbering\n   organization, may have jurisdiction.
    \ Such a body may choose to\n   restrict distribution of the data in such a way
    that it may not pass\n   over that country's national borders.\n"

    - "5.1.  Call Processing When Multiple Records Are Returned\n   It is likely that
      both E2U+sip and E2U+pstn Enumservice type records\n   will be returned for
      a given query.  In this case, this could result\n   in what is essentially an
      on-net and off-net pstn record.  Thus, one\n   record gives the associated address
      on an IP network, while the other\n   gives the associated address on the PSTN.
      \ As with multiple records\n   resulting from a typical ENUM query of the e164.arpa
      tree, it is up\n   to the application using an ENUM resolver to determine which\n
      \  record(s) to use and which record(s) to ignore.  Implementers should\n   take
      this into consideration and build logic into their applications\n   that can
      select appropriately from multiple records based on\n   business, network, or
      other rules.  For example, such a resolver\n   could be configured to grant
      preference to the on-net record, or\n   execute other logic, as required by
      the application.\n"

      be easier and more efficient\n   to use in practice than SIP URIs.  In addition,
      the use of tel URIs\n   may result in somewhat smaller NAPTR records, which,
      when considering\n   adding hundreds of millions of these records to the DNS,
      could have a\n   substantial impact on the processing and storage requirements
      for\n   service providers or other entities making use of this Enumservice\n
      \  type.\n   Implementers may wish to consider using regular expressions in
      order\n   to reduce the size of individual NAPTRs.  This will have a\n   significant
      effect on the overall size of the database involved.\n   Using the example in

  - "7.  Security Considerations\n   DNS, as used by ENUM, is a global, distributed
    database.  Should\n   implementers of this specification use e164.arpa or any
    other\n   publicly available domain as the tree for maintaining PSTN\n   Enumservice
    data, this information would be visible to anyone\n   anonymously.  While this
    is not qualitatively different from\n   publication in a telephone directory,
    it does open or ease access to\n   such data without any indication that such
    data has been accessed or\n   by whom it has been accessed.\n   Such data harvesting
    by third parties is often used to generate lists\n   of targets for unsolicited
    information.  Thus, a third party could\n   use this to generate a list that they
    can use to make unsolicited\n   \"telemarketing\" phone calls.  Many countries
    have do-not-call\n   registries or other legal or regulatory mechanisms in place
    to deal\n   with such abuses.\n   As noted earlier, carriers, service providers,
    and other users may\n   simply choose not to publish such information in the public
    e164.arpa\n   tree.  They may instead simply publish this in their internal ENUM\n
    \  routing database that is only able to be queried by trusted elements\n   of
    their network, such as softswitches and SIP proxy servers.  They\n   may also
    choose to publish such information in a carrier-only branch\n   of the E164.ARPA
    tree, should one be created.\n   Although an E.164 telephone number does not appear
    to reveal as much\n   identity information about a user as a name in the format\n
    \  sip:username@hostname or email:username@hostname, the information is\n   still
    publicly available; thus, there is still the risk of unwanted\n   communication.\n
    \  An analysis of threats specific to the dependence of ENUM on the DNS\n   and
    the applicability of DNSSEC [12] to this is provided in RFC 3761\n   [1].  A thorough
    analysis of threats to the DNS itself is covered in\n   RFC 3833 [13].\n"
