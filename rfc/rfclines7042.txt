Abstract Some IETF protocols make use of Ethernet frame formats and IEEE 802 parameters.
This document discusses several uses of such parameters in IETF protocols, specifies IANA considerations for assignment of points under the IANA OUI (Organizationally Unique Identifier), and provides some values for use in documentation.
This document obsoletes RFC 5342.
Some IETF protocols use Ethernet or other IEEE 802 related communication frame formats and parameters [IEEE802].
These include MAC (Media Access Control) identifiers and protocol identifiers.
This document specifies IANA considerations for the assignment of code points under the IANA OUI.
It also discusses several other uses by the IETF of IEEE 802 code points and provides some values for use in documentation.
As noted in [RFC2606] and [RFC5737], the use of designated code values reserved for documentation and examples reduces the likelihood of conflicts and confusion arising from their duplication of code points assigned for some deployed use.
[RFC5226] is incorporated herein except where there are contrary provisions in this document.
In this document, "IESG Ratification" is used in some cases, and it is specified in Section 5.1.
This is not the same as "IESG Approval" in [RFC5226].
Notations Used in This Document
This document uses hexadecimal notation.
that is, 8 bit byte) is represented by two hexadecimal digits giving the value of the octet as an unsigned integer.
Successive octets are separated by a hyphen.
This document consistently uses IETF bit ordering although the physical order of bit transmission within an octet on an IEEE [802.3] link is from the lowest order bit to the highest order bit (i.e., the reverse of the IETF's ordering).
RRTYPE" stands for a DNS Resource Record type [RFC6895].
For example, 2  24 is two to the twenty fourth power.
Changes from RFC 5342  Added MAC addresses and IANA OUI based protocol and other values for use in documentation, and added relevant Security Considerations language.
Eliminated any requirements for parallel unicast and multicast assignment unless requested.
Such requirements had been included in [RFC5342] on the theory they would make bookkeeping easier for IANA
but they have proved to be problematic in practice.
Re casted informational material about relevant IEEE assignment policies to take into account [RAC OUI].
Added AFNs and RRTYPEs for 48 bit and 64 bit MACs.
The IEEE Registration Authority Originally the responsibility of Xerox Corporation, the registration authority for Ethernet parameters is now the IEEE Registration Authority, available on the web at:
Anyone may apply to that Authority for parameters.
They may impose fees or other requirements but commonly waive fees for applications from standards development organizations.
A list of some assignments and their holders is downloadable from the IEEE Registration Authority site.
00 5E has been assigned to IANA.
There is no OUI value reserved at this time for documentation, but there are documentation code points under the IANA OUI specified below.
Ethernet Identifier Parameters Section 2.1 discusses EUI 48
MAC identifiers, their relationship to OUIs and other prefixes, and assignments under the IANA OUI.
Section 2.2 extends this to EUI 64 identifiers.
Section 2.3 discusses other IETF MAC identifier use not under the IANA OUI.
[RAC OUI] indicates that the IEEE Registration Authority Committee is exploring the feasibility of defining a new "EUI 128" identifier.
48 Bit MAC Identifiers, OUIs, and Other Prefixes 48 bit MAC "addresses" are the most commonly used Ethernet interface identifiers.
Those that are globally unique are also called EUI 48 identifiers.
An EUI 48 is structured into an initial 3 octet OUI (Organizationally Unique Identifier) and an additional 3 octets assigned by the OUI holder or into a larger initial prefix assigned to an organization and a shorter sequence of additional bits so as to add up to 48 bits in total.
For example, the IEEE has assigned IABs (Individual Address Blocks), where the first 4 1/2 octets (36 bits) are assigned, giving the holder of the IAB 1 1/2 octets (12 bits) they can control; however, IABs will become historic, and a wider range of prefix lengths will be made available [RAC OUI].
The IEEE describes its assignment procedures and policies for IEEE 802 related identifiers in [802 O&A], which is being revised.
Two bits within the initial octet of an EUI 48 have special significance in MAC addresses: the Group bit (01) and the Local bit (02).
OUIs and longer MAC prefixes are assigned with the Local bit zero and the Group bit unspecified.
Multicast identifiers may be constructed by turning on the Group bit, and unicast identifiers may be constructed by leaving the Group bit zero.
The Local bit is zero for globally unique EUI 48 identifiers assigned by the owner of an OUI or owner of a longer prefix.
If the Local bit is a one, the identifier has been considered by IEEE 802 to be a local identifier under the control of the local network administrator; however, there may be emerging recommendations from the IEEE Registration Authority on management of the local address space.
If the Local bit is on, the holder of an OUI has no special authority over MAC identifiers whose first 3 octets correspond to their OUI.
An AFN and a DNS RRTYPE have been assigned for 48 bit MAC addresses (see Section 5.2).
EUI 48 Assignments under the IANA
00 5E has been assigned to IANA as stated in Section 1.4 above.
This includes 2  24 EUI 48 multicast identifiers from 01 00 5E 00 00 00 to 01 00 5E FF FF FF and 2  24 EUI 48 unicast identifiers from 00 00 5E 00 00 00 to 00 00 5E FF FF FF.
Of these EUI 48 identifiers, the sub blocks reserved or thus far assigned by IANA for purposes of documentation are as follows:
Unicast, all blocks of 2  8 addresses thus far: 00
00 5E 00 00 00 through 00 00
5E 00 00 FF: reserved and require IESG Ratification for assignment (see Section 5.1).
01 00 through 00 00 5E
00 01 FF: assigned for the Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol (VRRP)
02 00 through 00 00 5E 00 02 FF: assigned for the IPv6 Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol (IPv6 VRRP)
00 5E 00 52 00 through 00 00 5E 00 52 FF: used for very small assignments.
Currently, 3 out of these 256 values have been assigned.
5E 00 53 00 through 00 00 5E 00 53 FF: assigned for use in documentation.
Multicast: 01 00 5E 00 00 00 through 01 00 5E 7F FF FF:
23 addresses assigned for IPv4 multicast [RFC1112].
00 5E 80 00 00 through 01 00 5E 8F FF FF:
2  20 addresses assigned for MPLS multicast [RFC5332].
00 5E 90 00 00 through 01 00 5E
8 addresses being used for very small assignments.
Currently, 4 out of these 256 values have been assigned.
00 5E 90 10 00 through 01 00 5E
2  8 addresses for use in documentation.
For more detailed and up to date information, see the "Ethernet Numbers" registry at http://www.iana.org.
The following values have been assigned for use in documentation: 00 00 5E 00 53 00 through 00 00 5E 00 53 FF for unicast and 01 00 5E 90 10 00 through 01 00 5E 90 10 FF for multicast.
Assignment Considerations EUI 48 assignments under the current or a future IANA OUI
(see Section 5.4) must meet the following requirements:  must be for standards purposes (either for an IETF Standard or other standard related to IETF work),  must be for a power of two size block of identifiers starting at a boundary that is an equal or greater power of two, including the assignment of one
(2  0) identifier,  must not be used to evade the requirement for vendors to obtain their own block of identifiers from the IEEE, and  must be documented in an Internet Draft or RFC.
In addition, approval must be obtained as follows (see the procedure in Section 5.1):
48 identifiers require Expert Review (see Section 5.1).
Large assignments of 131072 (2  17) or more EUI 48 identifiers require IESG Ratification (see Section 5.1).
([RFC5342] had a requirement for parallel unicast and multicast assignments under some circumstances even when one of the types was not included in the application.
That requirement has proved impractical and is eliminated in this document.)
64 Bit MAC Identifiers IEEE also defines a system of 64 bit MAC identifiers including EUI 64s.
EUI 64 identifiers are currently used as follows:
In a modified form to construct some IPv6 interface identifiers as described in Section 2.2.1  In IEEE Std 1394 (also known as FireWire and i.
802.15.4 (also known as ZigBee)
Adding a 5 octet (40 bit) extension to a 3 octet (24 bit)
OUI, or a shorter extension to longer assigned prefixes [RAC OUI] so as to total 64 bits, produces an EUI 64 identifier under that OUI or longer prefix.
As with EUI 48 identifiers, the first octet has the same Group and Local bits.
An AFN and a DNS RRTYPE have been assigned for 64 bit MAC addresses (see Section 5.2).
The discussion below is almost entirely in terms of the "Modified" form of EUI 64 identifiers; however, anyone assigned such an identifier can also use the unmodified form as a MAC identifier on any link that uses such 64 bit identifiers for interfaces.
IPv6 Use of Modified EUI
64 Identifiers MAC 64 identifiers are used to form the lower 64 bits of some IPv6 addresses (Section 2.5.1 and Appendix A of [RFC4291] and Appendix A of [RFC5214]).
When so used, the MAC 64 is modified by inverting the Local/Global bit to form an IETF "Modified EUI 64 identifier".
Below is an illustration of a Modified EUI 64 unicast identifier under the IANA OUI,
where aa bb cc dd ee is the extension.
The first octet is shown as 02 rather than 00 because, in Modified EUI 64 identifiers, the sense of the Local/Global bit is inverted compared with EUI 48 identifiers.
It is the globally unique values (universal scope) that have the 02 bit on in the first octet, while those with this bit off are locally assigned and out of scope for global assignment.
The Local/Global bit was inverted to make it easier for network operators to type in local scope identifiers.
Thus, such Modified EUI 64 identifiers as 1, 2, etc.
(ignoring leading zeros) are local.
Without the modification, they would have to be 02 00 00 00 00 00 00 01, 02 00 00 00 00
As with MAC 48 identifiers, the 01 bit on in the first octet indicates a group identifier.
When the first two octets of the extension of a Modified EUI 64 identifier are FF FE, the remainder of the extension is a 24 bit value as assigned by the OUI owner for an EUI 48.
For example: 02 00 5E FF FE
yy yy yy or 03 00
where yy yy yy is the portion (of an EUI 48 global unicast or multicast identifier) that is assigned by the OUI owner (IANA in this case).
Thus, any holder of one or more EUI 48 identifiers under the IANA OUI also has an equal number of Modified EUI 64 identifiers that can be formed by inserting FF FE in the middle of their EUI 48 identifiers and inverting the Local/Global bit.
(Note: [EUI 64] defines FF FF as the bits to be inserted to create an IEEE EUI 64 identifier from a MAC 48 identifier.
That document says the FF FE value is used when starting with an EUI 48 identifier.
The IETF uses only FF FE to create Modified EUI 64 identifiers from 48 bit Ethernet station identifiers regardless of whether they are EUI 48 or MAC 48 local identifiers.
EUI 48 and local MAC 48 identifiers are syntactically equivalent, and this doesn't cause any problems in practice.)
In addition, certain Modified EUI 64 identifiers under the IANA OUI are reserved for holders of IPv4 addresses as follows: 02 00 5E FE
xx xx xx xx where xx xx xx xx is
a 32 bit IPv4 address.
The owner of an IPv4 address has both the unicast  and multicast derived EUI 64 address.
Modified EUI 64 identifiers from 02 00 5E FE F0 00 00 00 to 02 00 5E FE FF FF FF FF are effectively reserved pending the specification of IPv4 Class E addresses.
However, for Modified EUI 64 identifiers based on an IPv4 address, the Local/Global bit should be set to correspond to whether the IPv4 address is local or global.
(Keep in mind that the sense of the Modified EUI 64 identifier Local/Global bit is reversed from that in (unmodified) MAC 64 identifiers.)
EUI 64 IANA Assignment Considerations
The following table shows which Modified EUI 64 identifiers under the IANA OUI are reserved, assigned, or available as indicated.
As noted above, the corresponding MAC addresses can be determined by complementing the 02 bit in the first octet.
In all cases, the corresponding multicast 64 bit MAC addresses formed by complementing the 01 bit in the first octet have the same status as the modified 64 bit unicast address blocks listed below.
02 00 5E 00 00 00 00 00 to 02 00 5E 0F FF FF FF FF reserved 02 00 5E 10 00 00 00 00 to 02 00 5E 10 00 00 00 FF assigned for documentation use 02 00 5E 10 00 00

5E FD FF FF FF FF reserved 02 00 5E FE 00 00 00 00 to 02 00 5E FE FF FF FF FF assigned to IPv4 address holders as described above 02 00 5E FF 00 00 00 00 to 02
00 5E FF FD FF FF FF reserved 02 00 5E FF FE 00 00 00 to 02 00 5E FF FE FF FF FF assigned for holders of EUI 48 identifiers under the IANA OUI as described above 02 00 5E FF FF 00 00 00 to 02 00 5E FF FF FF FF FF reserved The reserved identifiers above require IESG Ratification (see Section 5.1) for assignment.
IANA EUI 64 identifier assignments under the IANA OUI must meet the following requirements:  must be for standards purposes (either for an IETF Standard or other standard related to IETF work),  must be for a power of two size block of identifiers starting at a boundary that is an equal or greater power of two, including the assignment of one
(2  0) identifier,  must not be used to evade the requirement for vendors to obtain their own block of identifiers from the IEEE, and  must be documented in an Internet Draft or RFC.
In addition, approval must be obtained as follows (see the procedure in Section 5.1):
Assignments of any size, including 536870912 (2  29) or more EUI 64 identifiers, may be made with IESG Ratification (see Section 5.1).
The following blocks of unmodified 64 bit MAC addresses are for documentation use.
The IPv4 derived addresses are based on the IPv4 documentation addresses [RFC5737], and the MAC derived addresses are based on the EUI 48 documentation addresses above.
Unicast: 00 00 5E EF 10 00 00 00 to 00 00 5E EF 10

Other MAC 48 Identifiers Used by the IETF
There are two other blocks of MAC 48 identifiers that are used by the IETF as described below.
All MAC 48 multicast identifiers prefixed "33 33" (that is, the 2  32 multicast MAC identifiers in the range from 33 33 00 00 00 00 to 33 33 FF FF FF FF) are used as specified in [RFC2464] for IPv6 multicast.
In all of these identifiers, the Group bit (the bottom bit of the first octet) is on, as is required to work properly with existing hardware as a multicast identifier.
They also have the Local bit on and are used for this purpose in IPv6 networks.
It was the custom during IPv6 design to use "3" for unknown or example values, and 3333 Coyote Hill Road, Palo Alto, California, is the address of PARC
(Palo Alto Research Center, formerly "Xerox PARC").
Ethernet was originally specified by the Digital Equipment Corporation, Intel Corporation, and Xerox Corporation.
Ethernet protocol has sometimes been known as "DIX" Ethernet from the first letters of the names of these companies.)
The 'CF Series' The Informational [RFC2153] declared the 3 octet values from CF 00 00 through CF FF FF to be OUIs available for assignment by IANA to software vendors for use in PPP [RFC1661] or for other uses where vendors do not otherwise need an IEEE assigned OUI.
It should be noted that, when used as MAC 48 prefixes, these values have the Local and Group bits on, while all IEEE assigned OUIs thus far have those bits off.
The Group bit is meaningless in PPP.
To quote [RFC2153]: "The 'CF0000' series was arbitrarily chosen to match the PPP NLPID 'CF', as a matter of mnemonic convenience.
CF 00 00 is reserved, and IANA lists multicast identifier CF 00 00 00 00 00 as used for Ethernet loopback tests.
In over a decade of availability, only a handful of values in the 'CF Series' have been assigned.
> and "PPP Numbers" <http://www.iana.org/assignments/ppp numbers>).
The IANA Considerations in [RFC2153] were updated as follows by the approval of [RFC5342]
(no technical changes were made at that time):
Use of these identifiers based on IANA assignment was deprecated.
IANA was instructed not to assign any further values in the 'CF Series'.
Ethernet Protocol Parameters Ethernet protocol parameters provide a means of indicating the contents of a frame   for example, that its contents are IPv4 or IPv6.
The concept has been extended to labeling by "tags".
A tag in this sense is a prefix whose type is identified by an Ethertype that is then followed by either another tag, an Ethertype, or an LSAP
(Link  Layer Service Access Point) protocol indicator for the "main" body of the frame, as described below.
Traditionally, in the [802 O&A] world, tags are a fixed length and do not include any encoding of their own length.
Any device that is processing a frame cannot, in general, safely process anything in the frame past an Ethertype it does not understand.
An example is the C Tag (formerly the Q Tag) [802.1Q].
It provides customer VLAN and priority information for a frame.
There are two types of protocol identifier parameters that can occur in Ethernet frames after the initial MAC 48 destination and source identifiers:
These are 16 bit identifiers appearing as the initial two octets after the MAC destination and source (or after a tag), which, when considered as an unsigned integer, are equal to or larger than 0x0600.
These are 8 bit protocol identifiers that occur in pairs immediately after an initial 16 bit (two octet) remaining frame length, which is in turn after the MAC destination and source (or after a tag).
Such a length must, when considered as an unsigned integer, be less than 0x5DC, or it could be mistaken as an Ethertype.
LSAPs occur in pairs where one is intended to indicate the source protocol handler and one the destination protocol handler; however, use cases where the two are different have been relatively rare.
Neither Ethertypes nor LSAPs are assigned by IANA; they are assigned by the IEEE Registration Authority (see Section 1.3 above and Appendix B).
However, both LSAPs and Ethertypes have extension mechanisms so that they can be used with five octet Ethernet protocol identifiers under an OUI, including those assigned by IANA under the IANA OUI.
When using the IEEE 802 Logical Link Control (LLC) format (Subnetwork Access Protocol (SNAP))
[802 O&A] for a frame, an OUI based protocol identifier can be expressed as follows:
xx xx AA AA 03
zz zz where xx xx is the frame length and, as above, must be small enough not to be confused with an Ethertype; "AA" is the LSAP that indicates this use and is sometimes referred to as the SNAP Service Access Point (SAP); "03" is the LLC control octet indicating datagram service;
yy yy yy is an OUI; and zz zz is a protocol number, under that OUI, assigned by the OUI owner.
The odd five octet length for such OUI based protocol identifiers was chosen so that, with the LLC control octet ("03"), the result is 16 bit aligned.
When using an Ethertype to indicate the main type for a frame body, the special "OUI Extended Ethertype" 88 B7 is available.
Using this Ethertype, a frame body can begin with 88 B7 yy yy
yy zz zz where yy yy yy and zz zz have the same meaning as in the SNAP format described above.
It is also possible, within the SNAP format, to use an arbitrary Ethertype.
Putting the Ethertype as the zz zz field after an all  zeros OUI (00 00 00) does this.
It looks like xx xx AA AA 03 00 00 00
zz where zz zz is the Ethertype.
(Note that, at this point, the 802 protocol syntax facilities are sufficiently powerful that they could be chained indefinitely.
Whether support for such chaining is generally required is not clear, but [802 O&A] requires support for xx xx AA AA 03 00 00 00 88 B7 yy yy
although this could be more efficiently expressed by simply pinching out the "00 00 00 88 B7" in the middle.)
As well as labeling frame contents, 802 protocol types appear within NBMA (Non Broadcast Multi Access)
Next Hop Resolution Protocol [RFC2332] messages.
Such messages have provisions for both two octet Ethertypes and OUI based protocol types.
Ethernet Protocol Assignment under the IANA OUI Two octet protocol numbers under the IANA OUI are available, as in xx xx AA AA 03 00 00
5E qq qq where qq qq is the protocol number.
A number of such assignments have been made out of the 2  16 protocol numbers available from 00 00 5E 00 00 to 00 00 5E FF FF (see [IANA]).
The extreme values of this range, 00 00 5E 00 00 and 00 00 5E FF FF, are reserved and require IESG Ratification for assignment (see Section 5.1).
New assignments of SNAP SAP protocol (qq qq) numbers under the IANA OUI must meet the following requirements:  the assignment must be for standards use (either for an IETF Standard or other standard related to IETF work),  it must be documented in an Internet Draft or RFC, and  such protocol numbers are not to be assigned for any protocol that has an Ethertype (because that can be expressed by putting an all zeros "OUI" before the Ethertype as described above).
In addition, the Expert Review (or IESG Ratification for the two reserved values) must be obtained using the procedure specified in Section 5.1.
Documentation Protocol Number 0x0042 is a protocol number under the IANA OUI (that is, 00 00 5E 00 42) to be used for documentation purposes.
Some IEEE 802 and other protocols provide for parameters based on an OUI beyond those discussed above.
Such parameters most commonly consist of an OUI plus one octet of additional value.
They are usually called "vendor specific" parameters, although "organization specific" might be more accurate.
They would look like yy yy yy zz where yy yy yy is the OUI and zz is the additional specifier.
An example is the Cipher Suite Selector in IEEE [802.11].
Values may be assigned under the IANA OUI for such other OUI based parameter usage by Expert Review except that, for each use, the additional specifier values consisting of all zero bits and all one bits (0x00 (00 00 5E 00) and 0xFF (00 00 5E FF) for a one octet specifier) are reserved and require IESG Ratification (see Section 5.1) for assignment; also, the additional specifier value 0x42 (00 00 5E 42) is assigned for use in documentation.
Assignments of such other IANA OUI based parameters must be for standards use (either for an IETF Standard or other standard related to IETF work) and be documented in an Internet Draft or RFC.
The first time a value is assigned for a particular parameter of this type, an IANA registry will be created to contain that assignment and any subsequent assignments of values for that parameter under the IANA OUI.
The Expert will specify the name of the registry.
If different policies from those above are required for such a parameter, a BCP or Standards Track RFC must be adopted to update this BCP and specify the new policy and parameter.
The entirety of this document concerns IANA considerations for the assignment of Ethernet parameters in connection with the IANA OUI and related matters.
As this document replaces [RFC5342], references to [RFC5342]
in IANA registries have been replaced by references to this document.
In addition, any references in the registries to [DOC ADDR], which has been combined into this document, have been replaced by references to this document.
This document does not create any new IANA registries.
This document assigns MAC address values for documentation.
These values had been previously assigned by [DOC ADDR]; as noted above, any references in the registries to [DOC ADDR] have been replaced by references to this document.
The only other assignment that has been made by this document is a protocol number for documentation.
See Section 5.6 for details.
No existing assignment is changed by this document.
Expert Review and IESG Ratification
This section specifies the procedure for Expert Review and IESG Ratification of MAC, protocol, and other IANA OUI based identifiers.
The Expert(s) referred to in this document shall consist of one or more persons appointed by and serving at the pleasure of the IESG.
The procedure described for Expert Review assignments in this document is fully consistent with the IANA Expert Review policy described in [RFC5226].
While finite, the universe of code points from which Expert judged assignments will be made is felt to be large enough that the requirements given in this document and the Experts' good judgment are sufficient guidance.
The idea is for the Expert to provide a light sanity check for small assignments of EUI identifiers, with increased scrutiny by the Expert for medium sized assignments of EUI identifiers and assignments of protocol identifiers and other IANA OUI based parameters.
However, it can make sense to assign very large portions of the MAC identifier code point space.
(Note that existing assignments include one for 1/2 of the entire multicast IANA EUI 48 code point space and one for 1/16 of that multicast code point space.)
In those cases, and in cases of the assignment of "reserved" values, IESG Ratification of an Expert Review approval recommendation is required as described below.
The procedure is as follows:
The applicant always completes the appropriate template from Appendix A below and sends it to IANA
IANA always sends the template to an appointed Expert.
If the Expert recuses themselves or is non responsive, IANA may choose an alternative appointed Expert or, if none is available, will contact the IESG.
In all cases, if IANA receives a disapproval from an Expert selected to review an application template, the application will be denied.
If the assignment is based on Expert Review: If IANA receives approval and code points are available, IANA will make the requested assignment.
If the assignment is based on IESG Ratification: The procedure starts with the first steps above for Expert Review.
If the Expert disapproves the application, they simply inform IANA; however, if the Expert believes the application should be approved, or is uncertain and believes that the circumstances warrant the attention of the IESG, the Expert will inform IANA about their advice, and IANA will forward the application, together with the reasons for approval or uncertainty, to the IESG.
The IESG must decide whether the assignment will be granted.
This can be accomplished by a management item in an IESG telechat as is done for other types of requests.
If the IESG decides not to ratify a favorable opinion by the Expert or decides against an application where the Expert is uncertain, the application is denied; otherwise, it is granted.
The IESG will communicate its decision to the Expert and to IANA.
MAC Address AFNs and RRTYPEs IANA has assigned Address Family Numbers (AFNs) for MAC addresses as follows:
IANA has assigned DNS RRTYPEs [RFC6895] for MAC addresses as follows:
Informational IANA Web Page Material IANA maintains an informational listing on its web site concerning Ethertypes, OUIs, and multicast addresses assigned under OUIs other than the IANA OUI.
The title of this informational registry is "IEEE 802 Numbers".
IANA has merged in those Ethertypes listed in Appendix B that were not already included.
IANA will update that informational registry when changes are provided by the Expert.
When the available space for either multicast or unicast EUI 48 identifiers under OUI 00 00 5E has been 90% or more exhausted, IANA should request an additional OUI from the IEEE Registration Authority for further IANA assignment.
The appointed Expert(s) should monitor for this condition and notify IANA.
IANA OUI MAC Address Table
No changes have been made in the "IANA Unicast 48 bit MAC Addresses" and "IANA Multicast 48 bit MAC Addresses" tables except for the updates to references as specified in the first part of Section 5.
SNAP Protocol Number Table and Assignment
The "SNAP PROTOCOL IDs" table has been renamed the "SNAP Protocol Numbers" table.
"PID" has been replaced by "Protocol Number".
as the SNAP protocol number under the IANA OUI to be used for documentation purposes.
Security Considerations This document is concerned with assignment of parameters under the IANA OUI and closely related matters.
It is not directly concerned with security except as follows.
Confusion and conflict can be caused by the use of MAC addresses or other OUI derived protocol parameters as examples in documentation.
Examples used "only" in documentation can end up being coded and released or cause conflicts due to later real use and the possible acquisition of intellectual property rights in such addresses or parameters.
The reservation herein of MAC addresses and parameters for documentation purposes will minimize such confusion and conflict.
See [RFC7043] for security considerations in storing MAC addresses in the DNS.
This appendix provides the specific templates for IANA assignments of parameters.
Explanatory words in parentheses in the templates below may be deleted in a completed template as submitted to IANA.
Identifier or Identifier Block Template Applicant Name:
Applicant Email: Applicant Telephone: (starting with country code)
Use Name: (brief name of Parameter use such as "Foo Protocol" [RFC3092]) Document: (ID or RFC specifying use to which the identifier or block of identifiers will be put.)
Specify whether this is an application for EUI 48 or EUI 64 identifiers: Size of Block requested: (must be a power of two sized block, can be a block of size one (2  0))
Specify multicast, unicast, or both: A.2.
IANA OUI Based Protocol Number Template Applicant Name:
Applicant Email: Applicant Telephone: (starting with country code)
Use Name: (brief name of use of code point such as "Foo Protocol") Document: (ID or RFC specifying use to which the protocol identifier will be put.)

Other IANA OUI Based Parameter Template Applicant Name:
Applicant Email: Applicant Telephone: (starting with country code) Protocol where the OUI Based Parameter for which a value is being requested
appears: (such as: Cipher Suite selection in IEEE 802.11)
Use Name: (brief name of use of code point to be assigned, such as "Foo Cipher Suite" [RFC3092]) Document: (ID or RFC specifying use to which the other IANA OUI based parameter value will be put.)
