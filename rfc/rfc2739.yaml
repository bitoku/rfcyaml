  contents:
  - "Abstract\n   When scheduling a calendar entity, such as an event, it is a\n \
    \  prerequisite that an organizer has the calendar address of each\n   attendee\
    \ that will be invited to the event. Additionally, access to\n   an attendee's\
    \ current \"busy time\" provides an a priori indication of\n   whether the attendee\
    \ will be free to participate in the event.\n   In order to meet these challenges,\
    \ a calendar user agent (CUA) needs\n   a mechanism to locate (URI) individual\
    \ user's calendar and free/busy\n   time.\n   This memo defines three mechanisms\
    \ for obtaining a URI to a user's\n   calendar and free/busy time. These include:\n\
    \   - Manual transfer of the information;\n   - Personal data exchange using the\
    \ vCard format; and\n   - Directory lookup using the LDAP protocol.\n"

- title: 1  Calendaring and Scheduling URIs
  contents:
  - "1  Calendaring and Scheduling URIs\n   This memo defines four classes of URIs.\
    \ URIs are more useful if it is\n   understood what the URIs point to. Here is\
    \ a brief description:\n"
- title: 1.1 Free/Busy URI (FBURL)
  contents:
  - "1.1 Free/Busy URI (FBURL)\n   The free/busy URI is defined to be a transport\
    \ independent location\n   where a client can obtain information about when a\
    \ user is busy. At\n   the present time, this URI only points to busy time data.\
    \ Future\n   revisions of this specification may provide for the extended\n  \
    \ capability of publishing free time data.\n   If a calendaring and scheduling\
    \ client (i.e., CUA) were to retrieve\n   data from this location using FTP or\
    \ HTTP, it would get back an\n   iCalendar object [4] containing one or more \"\
    VFREEBUSY\" calendar\n   components. If a MIME transport is being used, the response\
    \ will be\n   contained within a \"text/calendar\" MIME body part as specified\
    \ in the\n   iCalendar specification [4]. For example:\n      BEGIN:VCALENDAR\n\
    \      VERSION:2.0\n      PRODID:-//hacksw/handcal//NONSGML v1.0//EN\n      METHOD:PUBLISH\n\
    \      BEGIN:VFREEBUSY\n      ATTENDEE:MAILTO:jane_doe@host1.com\n      DTSTART:19971013T050000Z\n\
    \      DTEND:19971124T050000Z\n      DTSTAMP:19970901T083000Z\n      FREEBUSY:19971015T133000Z/19971015T180000Z\n\
    \      FREEBUSY:19971015T190000Z/19971015T220000Z\n      FBURL:http://www.host.com/calendar/busy/jdoe.ifb\n\
    \      END:VFREEBUSY\n      END:VCALENDAR\n   The amount of busy time data pointed\
    \ to by the FBURL will generally\n   be pre-determined; for example one month\
    \ of busy time data. As a\n   guideline, it is recommended that the previous six\
    \ weeks of busy time\n   data be published at the location associated with the\
    \ FBURL. If this\n   URI points to a file resource, it is recommended that the\
    \ file\n   extension be \"ifb\" to distinguish it from an arbitrary iCalendar\n\
    \   object (e.g., with the \"ics\" file extension).\n"
- title: 1.2 Calendar Access URI (CAPURI)
  contents:
  - "1.2 Calendar Access URI (CAPURI)\n   The Calendar Access URI is defined to be\
    \ a protocol independent\n   location from which a calendaring and scheduling\
    \ client (i.e., CUA)\n   can communicate with a user's entire calendar.\n   The\
    \ semantics for using this URI as an access protocol locator are\n   yet to be\
    \ defined by the IETF CALSCH Working Group. This will be\n   addressed in the\
    \ \"Calendar Access Protocol\" specification.\n"
- title: 1.3 Calendar URI (CALURI)
  contents:
  - "1.3 Calendar URI (CALURI)\n   The Calendar URI is defined to be a protocol independent\
    \ location\n   from which a calendaring and scheduling client (i.e. CUA) can\n\
    \   retrieve an entire copy of a user's calendar. Retrieving data from\n   this\
    \ URI obtains a published \"snapshot\" of the user's calendar.\n   HTTP URI --\
    \ If the URI is an HTTP URI, then the content returned with\n   a GET should be\
    \ a \"text/calendar\" MIME body part containing one or\n   more iCalendar object.\n\
    \   FTP URI -- If the URI is an FTP URI, then the resource pointed to\n   should\
    \ be a file with an \"ics\" file extension containing one or more\n   iCalendar\
    \ objects.\n"
- title: 1.4 Default URIs
  contents:
  - "1.4 Default URIs\n   There are many cases where a user may have more than one\
    \ calendar. In\n   these cases, a user may have multiple URIs, each URI pointing\
    \ to a\n   calendar or free/busy data.\n   To make the case of multiple calendars\
    \ simpler for clients, the\n   concept of the \"default\" calendar is introduced.\
    \ A \"default\" calendar\n   is one that the user has designated as the calendar\
    \ that other users\n   should look at when accessing the user's calendar, or retrieving\
    \ the\n   user's free/busy time.\n   The default calendar may, in fact, include\
    \ rolled-up information from\n   all the user's other calendars. The other calendars\
    \ may only exist\n   for organizational purposes.\n"
- title: 2  Distribution
  contents:
  - "2  Distribution\n   These four URIs provide valuable pointers to calendaring\
    \ and\n   scheduling data that other users need in order to know when to\n   schedule\
    \ meetings, etc. There are several possibilities on how users\n   can communicate\
    \ these URIs to other users. The following section\n   outlines how these URIs\
    \ can be distributed to other users.\n"
- title: 2.1 Manual Transfer
  contents:
  - "2.1 Manual Transfer\n   The simplest way to obtain these URIs is for a user to\
    \ communicate\n   the URIs using some out-of-band mechanism such as verbally,\
    \ or in an\n   e-mail message, or by printing these URIs on a paper business card.\n\
    \   When using this mechanism, the user obtains these URIs using an out-\n   of-band\
    \ mechanism and then enters these URIs into their calendaring\n   software manually.\n"
- title: 2.2 Personal Data Exchange Using A vCard
  contents:
  - "2.2 Personal Data Exchange Using A vCard\n   A more sophisticated way to obtain\
    \ these URIs is for users to publish\n   vCards containing these URIs. The vCard\
    \ object can be transferred\n   between one another. Since many e-mail clients\
    \ allow a user to\n   automatically include a vCard with every message that the\
    \ user sends,\n   this provides a simple, transparent way for a user to distribute\n\
    \   their calendaring and scheduling URIs.\n   On the receiving end, an e-mail\
    \ client that provides an integrated\n   vCard database can provide a way to lookup\
    \ calendaring URIs for users\n   whose vCards are stored locally.\n"
- title: 2.3 vCard Schema Extensions
  contents:
  - "2.3 vCard Schema Extensions\n   Since the vCard [3] specification doesn't specify\
    \ how to encode\n   calendaring URIs in a vCard, this section is provided as an\
    \ extension\n   to vCard which specifies how to encode calendaring URIs within\
    \ a\n   vCard.\n   Inside a vCard object, four new properties are defined: \"\
    CALURI\",\n   \"CAPURI\", \"CALADRURI\", and \"FBURL\", as defined above.\n  \
    \ Any vCard can have one or more of these properties, each representing\n   a\
    \ calendar or free/busy time that is associated with the user.\n   One of these\
    \ properties can be designated as the \"default\" by adding\n   the \"PREF\" parameter.\n\
    \   Here is a simple example of a vCard containing a \"FBURL\" and a\n   \"CALURI\"\

    \ Servers are also\n   permitted to control a refresh access to an entry by requiring\n\
    \   clients to bind before issuing a RefreshRequest. This will have\n   implications\
    \ on the server performance and scalability.\n   Please also note, though, that\
    \ vCard objects may have been created by\n   an entity other than that represented\
    \ by the vCard. Recipients should\n   be certain of the source that generated\
    \ the vCard.\n   Also, care should be taken in making use of information obtained\
    \ from\n   directory servers that has been supplied by client, as it may now be\n\
    \   out of date. In many networks, for example, IP addresses are\n   automatically\
    \ assigned when a host connects to the network, and may\n   be reassigned if that\
    \ host later disconnects. An IP address obtained\n   from the directory may no\
    \ longer be assigned to the host that placed\n   the address in the directory.\
    \ This issue is not specific to LDAP or\n   dynamic directories.\n"
