  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   The Extended Community Attribute provides a mechanism for\
    \ labeling\n   information carried in BGP-4 [BGP-4].  It provides two important\n\
    \   enhancements over the existing BGP Community Attribute [RFC1997]:\n      -\
    \ An extended range, ensuring that communities can be assigned for\n        a\
    \ plethora of uses, without fear of overlap.\n      - The addition of a Type field\
    \ provides structure for the\n        community space.\n   The addition of structure\
    \ allows the usage of policy based on the\n   application for which the community\
    \ value will be used.  For example,\n   one can filter out all communities of\
    \ a particular type, or allow\n   only certain values for a particular type of\
    \ community.  It also\n   allows one to specify whether a particular community\
    \ is transitive or\n   non-transitive across an Autonomous System (AS) boundary.\
    \  Without\n   structure, this can only be accomplished by explicitly enumerating\n\
    \   all community values that will be denied or allowed and passed to BGP\n  \
    \ speakers in neighboring ASes based on the transitive property.\n"
