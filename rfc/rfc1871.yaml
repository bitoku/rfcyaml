- title: Abstract
  contents:
  - "Abstract\n   This document describes a modification to the IETF procedures to\n\
    \   allow an escape from a situation where the existing procedures are\n   not\
    \ working or do not seem to apply.  This is a modification to the\n   procedures\
    \ of RFC 1602 and 1603.\n"
- title: Introduction
  contents:
  - "Introduction\n   The current IETF procedures are documented in \"The Internet\
    \ Standards\n   Process -- Revision 2\" [1], and \"IETF Working Group Guidelines\
    \ and\n   Procedures\" [2].\n   There may be situations where following the procedures\
    \ leads to a\n   deadlock, or there may be situations where the procedures provide\
    \ no\n   guidance.  In these cases it may be appropriate to invoke the\n   variance\
    \ procedure described below.\n   A revision of the rules specified in RFC 1602\
    \ is underway, but may\n   take some time. This document describes an interim\
    \ amendment to RFC\n   1602, to avoid having to wait for this major revision in\
    \ a state of\n   paralysis.\n"
- title: Guiding Principles
  contents:
  - "Guiding Principles\n   Any variance from following the written rules must be\
    \ a public\n   process with opportunity for all concerned parties to comment.\n\
    \   The variance procedure should be similar to existing mechanisms and\n   involve\
    \ existing bodies.\n"
- title: The Variance Procedure
  contents:
  - "The Variance Procedure\n   Upon the recommendation of the responsible IETF Working\
    \ Group (or, if\n   no Working Group is constituted, upon the recommendation of\
    \ the\n   responsible ad hoc committee), the IESG may enter a particular\n   specification\
    \ into, or advance it within, the standards track even\n   though some of the\
    \ requirements of section 5 of RFC 1602 have not or\n   will not be met. The IESG\
    \ may approve such a variance, however, only\n   if it first determines that the\
    \ likely benefits to the Internet\n   community from entering or advancing the\
    \ specification on the\n   standards track are likely to outweigh the costs to\
    \ the Internet\n   community that result from noncompliance with section 5.  In\n\
    \   exercising this discretion, the IESG shall consider (a) the technical\n  \
    \ merit of the specification, (b) the possibility of achieving the\n   goals of\
    \ the Internet standards process without granting a variance,\n   (c) alternatives\
    \ to the granting of a variance, (d) the collateral\n   and precedential effects\
    \ of granting a variance, and (e) the IESG's\n   ability to craft a variance that\
    \ is as narrow as possible.  In\n   determining whether to approve a variance,\
    \ the IESG has discretion to\n   limit the scope of the variance to particular\
    \ parts of section 5 and\n   to impose such additional restrictions or limitations\
    \ as it\n   determines appropriate to protect the interests of the Internet\n\
    \   community.\n   There are five aspects that are involved in the variance procedure:\n\
    \   (1) detecting the problem, (2) proposing a solution, (3) public\n   review,\
    \ (4) accepting the solution, and (5) an appeal process.\n   1. Detecting the\
    \ problem\n   The responsible IETF Working Group, (or, if no Working Group is\n\
    \   constituted, the responsible ad hoc committee), may bring the matter\n   of\
    \ a variance before the IESG.\n   2. Proposing the solution\n   The IESG is responsible\
    \ for proposing the solution.\n   The IESG may enter a particular specification\
    \ into, or advance it\n   within, the standards track even though some of the\
    \ requirements of\n   section 5 of RFC 1602 have not or will not be met.\n   In\
    \ exercising this discretion, the IESG shall consider (a) the\n   technical merit\
    \ of the specification, (b) the possibility of\n   achieving the goals of the\
    \ Internet standards process without\n   granting a variance, (c) alternatives\
    \ to the granting of a variance,\n   (d) the collateral and precedential effects\
    \ of granting a variance,\n   and (e) the IESG's ability to craft a variance that\
    \ is as narrow as\n   possible.\n   The IESG should consult WG chair and appropriate\
    \ WG members as\n   needed, and the wishes of the WG should also be taken into\
    \ account.\n   3. Public review\n   There shall be an extended Last Call for public\
    \ review.\n   4. Accepting the solution\n   The IESG is responsible for accepting\
    \ the solution, and incorporating\n   comments from the Last Call.\n   The IESG\
    \ may approve such a variance, however, only if it first\n   determines that the\
    \ likely benefits to the Internet community from\n   entering or advancing the\
    \ specification on the standards track are\n   likely to outweigh the costs to\
    \ the Internet community that result\n   from noncompliance with section 5 of\
    \ RFC 1602.\n   In determining whether to approve a variance, the IESG has discretion\n\
    \   to limit the scope of the variance to particular parts of section 5\n   of\
    \ RFC 1602 and to impose such additional restrictions or limitations\n   as it\
    \ determines appropriate to protect the interests of the Internet\n   community.\n\
    \   5. The appeal procedure\n   The IAB is responsible for hearing and deciding\
    \ appeals.\n"
- title: Discussion
  contents:
  - "Discussion\n   When the IESG (on reviewing a recommendation for a variance) the\
    \ has\n   determined that there is a situation where the existing written rules\n\
    \   do not apply or lead to a deadlock, the IESG may propose a solution\n   to\
    \ the problem.\n   The solution may be developed by the IESG or suggested to the\
    \ IESG.\n   The solution may either (1) decide the particular instance of the\n\
    \   matter, or (2) define a procedure for resolving matters of this kind.\n  \
    \ In any case, the proposed solution will be documented in an Internet\n   Draft\
    \ and subjected to an extended Last Call.\n   Depending on the results of the\
    \ Last Call, the IESG will either\n   accept the solution; or revise the proposal,\
    \ update the Internet\n   Draft, and initiate another extended Last Call.\n  \
    \ When the IESG accepts a solution the Internet Draft shall be\n   forwarded to\
    \ the RFC Editor and published as an RFC.\n   The IAB shall be available to hear\
    \ and decide on appeals of the use\n   this variance procedure.\n"
