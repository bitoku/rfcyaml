- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   This document is part of the ILNP document set, which has\
    \ had\n   extensive review within the IRTF Routing RG.  ILNP is one of the\n \
    \  recommendations made by the RG Chairs.  Separately, various refereed\n   research\
    \ papers on ILNP have also been published during this decade.\n   So the ideas\
    \ contained herein have had much broader review than the\n   IRTF Routing RG.\
    \  The views in this document were considered\n   controversial by the Routing\
    \ RG, but the RG reached a consensus that\n   the document still should be published.\
    \  The Routing RG has had\n   remarkably little consensus on anything, so virtually\
    \ all Routing RG\n   outputs are considered controversial.\n   At present, the\
    \ Internet research and development community is\n   exploring various approaches\
    \ to evolving the Internet Architecture to\n   solve a variety of issues including,\
    \ but not limited to, scalability\n   of inter-domain routing [RFC4984].  A wide\
    \ range of other issues\n   (e.g., site multihoming, node multihoming, site/subnet\
    \ mobility, node\n   mobility) are also active concerns at present.  Several different\n\
    \   classes of evolution are being considered by the Internet research\n   and\
    \ development community.  One class is often called \"Map and\n   Encapsulate\"\
    , where traffic would be mapped and then tunnelled\n   through the inter-domain\
    \ core of the Internet.  Another class being\n   considered is sometimes known\
    \ as \"Identifier/Locator Split\".  This\n   document relates to a proposal that\
    \ is in the latter class of\n   evolutionary approaches.\n   The Identifier-Locator\
    \ Network Protocol (ILNP) is a proposal for\n   evolving the Internet Architecture.\
    \  It differs from the current\n   Internet Architecture primarily by deprecating\
    \ the concept of an IP\n   Address and instead defining two new objects, each\
    \ having crisp\n   syntax and semantics.  The first new object is the Locator,\
    \ a\n   topology-dependent name for a subnetwork.  The other new object is\n \
    \  the Identifier, which provides a topology-independent name for a\n   node.\n"
- title: 1.1.  Document Roadmap
  contents:
  - "1.1.  Document Roadmap\n   This document describes a new ICMPv4 Locator Update\
    \ message used by\n   an ILNP node to inform its correspondent nodes of any changes\
    \ to its\n   set of valid Locators.\n   The ILNP architecture can have more than\
    \ one engineering\n   instantiation.  For example, one can imagine a \"clean-slate\"\
    \n   engineering design based on the ILNP architecture.  In separate\n   documents,\
    \ we describe two specific engineering instances of ILNP.\n   The term \"ILNPv6\"\
    \ refers precisely to an instance of ILNP that is\n   based upon, and is backwards\
    \ compatible with, IPv6.  The term\n   \"ILNPv4\" refers precisely to an instance\
    \ of ILNP that is based upon,\n   and backwards compatible with, IPv4.\n   Many\
    \ engineering aspects common to both ILNPv4 and ILNPv6 are\n   described in [RFC6741].\
    \  A full engineering specification for either\n   ILNPv6 or ILNPv4 is beyond\
    \ the scope of this document.\n   Readers are referred to other related ILNP documents\
    \ for details not\n   described here:\n   a) [RFC6740] is the main architectural\
    \ description of ILNP, including\n      the concept of operations.\n   b) [RFC6741]\
    \ describes engineering and implementation considerations\n      that are common\
    \ to both ILNPv4 and ILNPv6.\n   c) [RFC6742] defines additional DNS resource\
    \ records that support\n      ILNP.\n   d) [RFC6743] defines a new ICMPv6 Locator\
    \ Update message used by an\n      ILNP node to inform its correspondent nodes\
    \ of any changes to its\n      set of valid Locators.\n   e) [RFC6744] defines\
    \ a new IPv6 Nonce Destination Option used by\n      ILNPv6 nodes (1) to indicate\
    \ to ILNP correspondent nodes (by\n      inclusion within the initial packets\
    \ of an ILNP session) that the\n      node is operating in the ILNP mode and (2)\
    \ to prevent off-path\n      attacks against ILNP ICMP messages.  This Nonce is\
    \ used, for\n      example, with all ILNP ICMPv6 Locator Update messages that\
    \ are\n      exchanged among ILNP correspondent nodes.\n   f) [RFC6746] defines\
    \ a new IPv4 Nonce Option used by ILNPv4 nodes to\n      carry a security nonce\
    \ to prevent off-path attacks against ILNP\n      ICMP messages, and it also defines\
    \ a new IPv4 Identifier Option\n      used by ILNPv4 nodes.\n   g) [RFC6747] describes\
    \ extensions to Address Resolution Protocol\n      (ARP) for use with ILNPv4.\n\
    \   h) [RFC6748] describes optional engineering and deployment functions\n   \
    \   for ILNP.  These are not required for the operation or use of ILNP\n     \
    \ and are provided as additional options.\n"
- title: 1.2.  ICMPv4 Locator Update
  contents:
  - "1.2.  ICMPv4 Locator Update\n   As described in [RFC6740] and [RFC6741], an ILNP\
    \ for IPv4 (ILNPv4)\n   node might need to inform correspondent ILNPv4 nodes of\
    \ changes to\n   the set of valid Locator values.  The new ICMPv4 Locator Update\n\
    \   message described in this document enables an ILNP-capable node to\n   update\
    \ its correspondents about the currently valid set of Locators\n   valid to use\
    \ in reaching the node sending this message [RFC2460]\n   [RFC4443].\n   This\
    \ new ICMPv4 message MUST ONLY be used for ILNPv4 sessions.\n   Authentication\
    \ is always required, as described in the Security\n   Considerations section\
    \ later in this document.\n   Some might consider any and all use of ICMP to be\
    \ undesirable.\n   In that context, please note that while this specification\
    \ uses ICMP,\n   on grounds that this is a control message, there is no architectural\n\
    \   difference between using ICMP and using some different framing, for\n   example\
    \ UDP.\n"

    \  The field might be used for\n                               some protocol function\
    \ in future.\n   NOTE WELL:  The ICMP Type value is allocated for shared\n   \
    \            experimental use in Section 8 of [RFC4727].\n               It is\
    \ not uniquely assigned to ILNPv4.  So,\n               implementations need to\
    \ code particularly\n               defensively as other IPv4 experiments might\
    \ be\n               using this same ICMP Type value for an\n               entirely\
    \ different purpose with a different\n               ICMP packet format.\n   The\
    \ Operation field has value 1 (hexadecimal 0x01) for a Locator\n   Update Advertisement.\
    \  The Operation field has value 2 (hexadecimal\n   0x02) for a Locator Update\
    \ Acknowledgement.  All other values of the\n   Operation field are reserved for\
    \ future use by future revisions of\n   this specification.\n   A node whose set\
    \ of valid Locators has changed MUST send Locator\n   Update Advertisement messages\
    \ to each correspondent node for each\n   active unicast ILNP session.  For unicast\
    \ ILNP sessions, the receiver\n   of a valid (i.e., authentication checks all\
    \ passed, advertisement is\n   received from a current correspondent node) Locator\
    \ Update\n   Advertisement addressed to the receiver MUST send a Locator Update\n\
    \   Acknowledgement back to the sender of the Locator Update\n   Advertisement.\
    \  The Acknowledgement message body is identical to the\n   received Advertisement\
    \ message body, except for the Operation value.\n   All ILNPv4 ICMP Locator Update\
    \ messages MUST contain a valid ILNPv4\n   Identifier Option and MUST contain\
    \ an ILNPv4 Nonce Option.\n   ILNPv4 ICMP Locator Update messages also MAY be\
    \ protected using IP\n   Security for ILNP [RFC6741] [RFC4301].  Deployments in\
    \ high-threat\n   environments SHOULD also protect ILNPv4 ICMP Locator Update\
    \ messages\n   using IPsec.  While IPsec Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP)\
    \ can\n   protect a payload, no form of IPsec ESP is able to protect an IPv4\n\
    \   Option that appears prior to the ESP header.  Note that even when IP\n   Security\
    \ for ILNP is in use, the ILNPv4 Nonce Option still MUST be\n   present.  This\
    \ simplifies protocol processing, and it also means that\n   a receiver can perform\
    \ the inexpensive check of the Nonce value\n   before performing any (potentially\
    \ expensive) cryptographic\n   calculation.\n"
- title: 3.  Transport Protocol Effects
  contents:
  - "3.  Transport Protocol Effects\n   The ICMP Locator Update message has no impact\
    \ on any transport\n   protocol.\n   The ICMP Locator Update message might affect\
    \ where packets for a\n   given transport-layer session are sent, but an ILNP\
    \ design objective\n   is to decouple transport protocols (e.g., TCP, UDP, SCTP)\
    \ and\n   transport-layer sessions network-layer changes.\n"
- title: 4.  Implementation Considerations
  contents:
  - "4.  Implementation Considerations\n   Implementers may use any internal implementation\
    \ they wish, provided\n   that the external appearance is the same as this implementation\n\
    \   approach.\n   To support ILNPv4, and to retain the incremental deployability\
    \ and\n   backwards compatibility needed, the network layer needs a mode bit in\n\
    \   the Transport Control Block (or its equivalent) to track which IP\n   sessions\
    \ are using the classic IPv4 mode and which IP sessions are\n   using ILNPv4 mode.\n\
    \   Further, when supporting ILNPv4, nodes will need to support a\n   Identifier\
    \ Locator Communication Cache (ILCC) in the network layer as\n   described in\
    \ [RFC6741].\n   A node sending an ICMP Locator Update message MUST include all\n\
    \   currently valid Locator values in that message.  A node receiving a\n   valid\
    \ ICMP Locator Update message MUST replace the previously current\n   set of Locator\
    \ values for that correspondent node in its own ILCC\n   with the newly received\
    \ set of Locator values.\n   Every implementation needs to support a large number\
    \ of Locator\n   values being sent or received in a single ICMP Locator Update\n\
    \   message, because a multihomed node or multihomed site might have a\n   large\
    \ number of upstream links to different service providers, each\n   with its own\
    \ Locator value.\n   It should be noted that as the ICMP Type uses an experimental\
    \ value\n   from [RFC4727], care should be taken when using with other protocols\n\
    \   also using experimental values.\n"
- title: 5.  Backwards Compatibility
  contents:
  - "5.  Backwards Compatibility\n   This IPv4 ICMP message uses the same checksum\
    \ calculations as any\n   other IPv4 ICMP message.\n   When ILNPv4 is not in use,\
    \ the receiving IPv4 mode MUST discard the\n   ICMP Locator Update packet without\
    \ processing the packet.\n"
- title: 6.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "6.  Security Considerations\n   Security considerations for the overall ILNP\
    \ Architecture are\n   described in [RFC6740].  Additional common security considerations\n\
    \   are described in [RFC6741].  This section describes security\n   considerations\
    \ specific to ILNPv4 topics discussed in this document.\n   The ICMPv4 Locator\
    \ Update message MUST ONLY be used for ILNPv4\n   sessions.\n   The ILNPv4 Nonce\
    \ Option [RFC6746] MUST be present in packets\n   containing an ICMPv4 Locator\
    \ Update message.  Further, the received\n   Nonce Destination Option must contain\
    \ the correct nonce value for the\n   packet to be accepted by the recipient and\
    \ then passed to the ICMPv4\n   protocol for processing.  If either of these requirements\
    \ are not\n   met, the received packet MUST be discarded as a forgery, and a\n\
    \   security event SHOULD be logged by the system receiving the non-\n   authentic\
    \ packet.\n   ILNP sessions operating in higher risk environments SHOULD use IP\n\
    \   Security for ILNP [RFC6741] [RFC4301] *in addition* to the ILNPv4\n   Nonce\
    \ Option.  Use of IP Security for ILNP to protect a packet does\n   NOT permit\
    \ the packet to be sent without the Nonce Option.\n   Implementations need to\
    \ support the case where a single ICMP Locator\n   Update message contains a large\
    \ number of Locator and Preference\n   values and ought not develop a security\
    \ fault (e.g., stack overflow)\n   due to a received message containing more Locator\
