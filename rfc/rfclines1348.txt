This RFC defines the format of two new Resource Records (RRs) for the Domain Name System (DNS), and reserves corresponding DNS type mnemonic and numerical codes.
This format may be used with the any proposal that has variable length addresses, but is targeted for CLNP use.
This memo assumes that the reader is familiar with the DNS [3,4].
This section describes an experimental representation of NSAP addresses in the DNS.
There are several reasons to take this approch.
First, it provides simple documentation of the correct addresses to use in static configurations of CLNP compliant hosts and routers.
NSAP support requires that a new DNS resource record entry type ("NSAP") be defined, to store longer Internet (i.e., NSAP) addresses.
This resource record allows mapping from DNS names to NSAP addresses, and will contain entries for systems which are able to run Internet applications, over TCP or UDP, over CLNP.
The backward translation (from NSAP address to DNS name) is facilitated by definition of an associated resource record.
This resource record is known as "NSAP PTR", and is used in a manner analogous to the existing "in addr.arpa".
These RRs are intended for use in a proposal [6] by one of the members of the NOOP WG to address the next generation internet.
The NSAP RR is defined with mnemonic NSAP and type code 22
An NSAP (Network Service Access Protocol) number is a unique string to OSI transport service.
The numbering plan follows RFC 1237 and associated OSI definitions for NSAP format.
NSAP has the following format:
> identifies the number of octets in the <NSAP address> as defined by the various national and international authorities.
enumerates the actual octet values assigned by the assigning authority.
Its format in master files is a <character  string> syntactically identical to that used in TXT and HINFO.
The format of NSAP is class insensitive.
NSAP RR causes no additional section processing.
The RR data is the ASCII representation of the digits.
It is encoded as two <character strings
>, i.e., count followed by characters.
The NSAP PTR RR is defined with mnemonic NSAP PTR and a type code 23 (decimal).
Its function is analogous to the PTR record used for IP addresses [4,7].
NSAP PTR has the following format: <NSAP suffix> <ttl
enumerates the actual octet values assigned by the assigning authority for the LOCAL network.
Its format in master files is a <character string> syntactically identical to that used in TXT and HINFO.
The format of NSAP PTR is class insensitive.
NSAP PTR RR causes no additional section processing.
For example: In net ff08000574.nsap in addr.arpa: 444433332222111199990123000000ff    NSAP PTR   foo.bar.com.
The RR data is the ASCII representation of the digits.
It is encoded as a <character string
