Abstract This document extends the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) to support absolute True and False filters based upon similar capabilities found in X.500 directory systems.
The document also extends the String Representation of LDAP Search Filters to support these filters.
The X.500 Directory Access Protocol (DAP) [X.511] supports absolute True and False assertions.
An 'and' filter with zero elements always evaluates to True.
An 'or' filter with zero elements always evaluates to False.
[RFC1777][RFC3494] placed no restriction on the number of elements in 'and' and 'or' filter sets, the LDAPv2 string representation [RFC1960][RFC3494] could not represent empty 'and' and 'or' filter sets.
Due to this, absolute True or False filters were (unfortunately) eliminated from LDAPv3 [RFC4510].
This documents extends LDAPv3 to support absolute True and False assertions by allowing empty 'and' and 'or' in Search filters [RFC4511] and extends the filter string representation [RFC4515] to allow empty filter lists.
It is noted that certain search operations, such as those used to retrieve subschema information [RFC4512], require use of particular filters.
This document does not change these requirements.
This feature is intended to allow a more direct mapping between DAP and LDAP (as needed to implement DAP to LDAP gateways).

Absolute True and False Filters
Implementations of this extension SHALL allow 'and' and 'or' choices with zero filter elements.
An 'and' filter consisting of an empty set of filters SHALL evaluate to True.
An 'or' filter consisting of an empty set of filters SHALL evaluate to False.
Servers supporting this feature SHOULD publish the Object Identifier 1.3.6.1.4.1.4203.1.5.3 as a value of the 'supportedFeatures' [RFC4512] attribute in the root DSE.
Clients supporting this feature SHOULD NOT use the feature unless they know that the server supports it.
The (re)introduction of absolute True and False filters is not believed to raise any new security considerations.
Implementors of this (or any)
LDAPv3 extension should be familiar with general LDAPv3 security considerations [RFC4510].
IANA Considerations Registration of this feature has been completed by the IANA [RFC4520].
