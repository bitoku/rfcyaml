  - "1.  Introduction\n   MD5 [MD5] is a message digest algorithm that takes as input\
    \ a message\n   of arbitrary length and produces as output a 128-bit \"fingerprint\"\
    \ or\n   \"message digest\" of the input.  The published attacks against MD5\n\
    \   show that it is not prudent to use MD5 when collision resistance is\n   required.\
    \  This document replaces the security considerations in RFC\n   1321 [MD5].\n\
    \   [HMAC] defined a mechanism for message authentication using\n   cryptographic\
    \ hash functions.  Any message digest algorithm can be\n   used, but the cryptographic\
    \ strength of HMAC depends on the\n   properties of the underlying hash function.\
    \  [HMAC-MD5] defined test\n   cases for HMAC-MD5.  This document updates the\
    \ security\n   considerations in [HMAC], which [HMAC-MD5] points to for its security\n\
    \   considerations.\n   [HASH-Attack] summarizes the use of hashes in many protocols\
    \ and\n   discusses how attacks against a message digest algorithm's one-way\n\
    \   and collision-free properties affect and do not affect Internet\n   protocols.\
    \  Familiarity with [HASH-Attack] is assumed.  One of the\n   uses of message\
    \ digest algorithms in [HASH-Attack] was integrity\n   protection.  Where the\
    \ MD5 checksum is used inline with the protocol\n   solely to protect against\
    \ errors, an MD5 checksum is still an\n   acceptable use.  Applications and protocols\
    \ need to clearly state in\n   their security considerations what security services,\
    \ if any, are\n   expected from the MD5 checksum.  In fact, any application and\n\
    \   protocol that employs MD5 for any purpose needs to clearly state the\n   expected\
    \ security services from their use of MD5.\n"
- title: 2.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "2.  Security Considerations\n   MD5 was published in 1992 as an Informational\
    \ RFC.  Since that time,\n   MD5 has been extensively studied and new cryptographic\
    \ attacks have\n   been discovered.  Message digest algorithms are designed to\
    \ provide\n   collision, pre-image, and second pre-image resistance.  In addition,\n\
    \   message digest algorithms are used with a shared secret value for\n   message\
    \ authentication in HMAC, and in this context, some people may\n   find the guidance\
    \ for key lengths and algorithm strengths in\n   [SP800-57] and [SP800-131] useful.\n\
    \   MD5 is no longer acceptable where collision resistance is required\n   such\
    \ as digital signatures.  It is not urgent to stop using MD5 in\n   other ways,\
    \ such as HMAC-MD5; however, since MD5 must not be used for\n   digital signatures,\
    \ new protocol designs should not employ HMAC-MD5.\n   Alternatives to HMAC-MD5\
    \ include HMAC-SHA256 [HMAC] [HMAC-SHA256] and\n   [AES-CMAC] when AES is more\
    \ readily available than a hash function.\n"
- title: 2.1.  Collision Resistance
  contents:
  - "2.1.  Collision Resistance\n   Pseudo-collisions for the compress function of\
    \ MD5 were first\n   described in 1993 [denBBO1993].  In 1996, [DOB1995] demonstrated\
    \ a\n   collision pair for the MD5 compression function with a chosen initial\n\
    \   value.  The first paper that demonstrated two collision pairs for MD5\n  \
    \ was published in 2004 [WFLY2004].  The detailed attack techniques for\n   MD5\
    \ were published at EUROCRYPT 2005 [WAYU2005].  Since then, a lot\n   of research\
    \ results have been published to improve collision attacks\n   on MD5. The attacks\
    \ presented in [KLIM2006] can find MD5 collision in\n   about one minute on a\
    \ standard notebook PC (Intel Pentium, 1.6GHz).\n   [STEV2007] claims that it\
    \ takes 10 seconds or less on a 2.6Ghz\n   Pentium4 to find collisions.  In [STEV2007],\
    \ [SLdeW2007],\n   [SSALMOdeW2009], and [SLdeW2009], the collision attacks on\
    \ MD5 were\n   successfully applied to X.509 certificates.\n   Notice that the\
    \ collision attack on MD5 can also be applied to\n   password-based challenge-and-response\
    \ authentication protocols such\n   as the APOP (Authenticated Post Office Protocol)\
    \ option in POP [POP]\n   used in post office authentication as presented in [LEUR2007].\n\
    \   In fact, more delicate attacks on MD5 to improve the speed of finding\n  \
    \ collisions have been published recently.  However, the aforementioned\n   results\
    \ have provided sufficient reason to eliminate MD5 usage in\n   applications where\
    \ collision resistance is required such as digital\n   signatures.\n"
- title: 2.2.  Pre-Image and Second Pre-Image Resistance
  contents:
  - "2.2.  Pre-Image and Second Pre-Image Resistance\n   Even though the best result\
    \ can find a pre-image attack of MD5 faster\n   than exhaustive search, as presented\
    \ in [SAAO2009], the complexity\n   2^123.4 is still pretty high.\n"
- title: 2.3.  HMAC
  contents:
  - "2.3.  HMAC\n   The cryptanalysis of HMAC-MD5 is usually conducted together with\
    \ NMAC\n   (Nested MAC) since they are closely related.  NMAC uses two\n   independent\
    \ keys K1 and K2 such that NMAC(K1, K2, M) = H(K1, H(K2,\n   M), where K1 and\
    \ K2 are used as secret initialization vectors (IVs)\n   for hash function H(IV,\
    \ M).  If we re-write the HMAC equation using\n   two secret IVs such that IV2\
    \ = H(K Xor ipad) and IV1 = H(K Xor opad),\n   then HMAC(K, M) = NMAC(IV1, IV2,\
    \ M).  Here it is very important to\n   notice that IV1 and IV2 are not independently\
    \ selected.\n   The first analysis was explored on NMAC-MD5 using related keys\
    \ in\n   [COYI2006].  The partial key recovery attack cannot be extended to\n\
    \   HMAC-MD5, since for HMAC, recovering partial secret IVs can hardly\n   lead\
    \ to recovering (partial) key K.  Another paper presented at\n   Crypto 2007 [FLN2007]\
    \ extended results of [COYI2006] to a full key\n   recovery attack on NMAC-MD5.\
    \  Since it also uses related key attack,\n   it does not seem applicable to HMAC-MD5.\n\
    \   A EUROCRYPT 2009 paper presented a distinguishing attack on HMAC-MD5\n   [WYWZZ2009]\
    \ without using related keys.  It can distinguish an\n   instantiation of HMAC\
    \ with MD5 from an instantiation with a random\n   function with 2^97 queries\
    \ with probability 0.87.  This is called\n   distinguishing-H.  Using the distinguishing\
    \ attack, it can recover\n   some bits of the intermediate status of the second\
    \ block.  However,\n   as it is pointed out in [WYWZZ2009], it cannot be used\
    \ to recover the\n   (partial) inner key H(K Xor ipad).  It is not obvious how\
    \ the attack\n   can be used to form a forgery attack either.\n   The attacks\
    \ on HMAC-MD5 do not seem to indicate a practical\n   vulnerability when used\
    \ as a message authentication code.\n   Considering that the distinguishing-H\
    \ attack is different from a\n   distinguishing-R attack, which distinguishes\
    \ an HMAC from a random\n   function, the practical impact on HMAC usage as a\
    \ pseudorandom\n   function (PRF) such as in a key derivation function is not\
    \ well\n   understood.\n   Therefore, it may not be urgent to remove HMAC-MD5\
    \ from the existing\n   protocols.  However, since MD5 must not be used for digital\n\
    \   signatures, for a new protocol design, a ciphersuite with HMAC-MD5\n   should\
    \ not be included.  Options include HMAC-SHA256 [HMAC]\n   [HMAC-SHA256] and [AES-CMAC]\
    \ when AES is more readily available than\n   a hash function.\n"
