  - "1.  Introduction\n   Mobile equipment that is either a) single-mode 3GPP using\
    \ only 3GPP\n   technology to transmit and receive voice or data or b) dual-mode\n\
    \   3GPP/3GPP2 using either 3GPP or 3GPP2 technology to transmit and\n   receive\
    \ voice or data has an International Mobile station Equipment\n   Identity (IMEI)\
    \ to identify it.  A URN namespace and an NSS for the\n   IMEI are defined in\
    \ [RFC7254].  For cases where the mobile equipment\n   uses IMEI as an identity\
    \ for dual-mode 3GPP/3GPP2 access, the IMEI\n   URN as defined in [RFC7254] can\
    \ be used to identify the mobile\n   equipment.\n   However, single-mode 3GPP2\
    \ mobile equipment that supports only 3GPP2\n   access technology to transmit\
    \ and receive voice or data has a\n   hexadecimal MEID.  Since there are fundamental\
    \ differences between\n   MEID and IMEI (i.e., in encoding, format, and the ownership),\n\
    \   [RFC7254] cannot be employed to represent the hexadecimal MEID.\n   This document\
    \ specifies a URN namespace for 3GPP2 and an NSS for the\n   MEID as per the namespace\
    \ registration requirement in [RFC8141].  The\n   structure of an MEID is 15 hexadecimal\
    \ digits long and is defined by\n   3GPP2 (see [S.R0048-A]) to uniquely identify\
    \ each individual piece of\n   mobile equipment (e.g., a handset or mobile phone).\
    \  The 3GPP2 has a\n   requirement to be able to use an MEID as a URN.  This document\n\
    \   fulfills that requirement.  The Namespace Identifier (NID) '3gpp2' is\n  \
    \ for identities used in 3GPP2 networks.  The MEID is managed by the\n   3GPP2,\
    \ so this NID is managed by the 3GPP2.  This specification\n   defines only NSSs\
    \ constructed from MEIDs under the '3gpp2' NID.\n   These NSSs start with \"meid:\"\
    \ in order to identify them as such.  In\n   the future, the 3GPP2 may specify\
    \ other types of NSSs under the\n   '3gpp2' NID.\n   The MEID is 15 hexadecimal\
    \ digits long, includes a manufacturer code\n   of 8 hexadecimal digits, and includes\
    \ the serial number of 6\n   hexadecimal digits plus a hexadecimal digit as a\
    \ check digit.\n   The manufacturer code identifies the mobile equipment manufacturer.\n\
    \   A manufacturer can be assigned more than one manufacturer code.  The\n   serial\
    \ number uniquely identifies each piece of mobile equipment\n   within the manufacturer\
    \ code.  The check digit is used as assurance\n   of integrity in error-prone\
    \ operations, e.g., when used with certain\n   types of readers during inventory-management\
    \ operations.  The check\n   digit is not transmitted.  Therefore, the first 14\
    \ of the 15\n   hexadecimal digits are used for defining the MEID as a URN.\n\
    \   The information here is meant to be a concise guide for those wishing\n  \
    \ to use the hexadecimal MEID as a URN.  Nothing in this document\n   should be\
    \ construed to override [S.R0048-A], which defines the MEID.\n"

    \ Rd., Suite 200\n      Arlington, Virginia 22201, United States of America\n\
    \   Purpose:  The '3gpp2' namespace is used to identify mobile equipment\n   \
    \   that uses technologies defined by the Third Generation Partnership\n     \
    \ Project 2 ((3GPP2); initially, such equipment is identified by a\n      URN\
    \ that embeds a Mobile Equipment Identity (MEID) that is 15\n      hexadecimal\
    \ digits long and unique to each individual piece of\n      mobile equipment (e.g.,\
    \ a handset or mobile phone).\n   Syntax:  The identifier is expressed in American\
    \ Standard Code for\n      Information Interchange (ASCII) characters and has\
    \ a hierarchical\n      expression using the Augmented Backus-Naur Form (ABNF)\
    \ defined in\n      [RFC5234], as follows:\n      pp2-urn              = \"urn:\"\
    \ pp2-NID \":\" pp2-NSS\n      pp2-NID              = \"3gpp2\"\n      pp2-NSS\
    \              = meid-specifier / future-pp2-specifier\n      meid-specifier \
    \      = \"meid:\" meidval\n      future-pp2-specifier = future-specifier *[ \"\
    :\" 1*( pchar / \"/\" )]\n      future-specifier     = 1*pp2-char\n      pp2-char\
    \             = ALPHA / DIGIT / \"-\" / \".\" / \"_\" /\n                    \
    \         pct-encoded\n      where 'pchar' and 'pct-encoded' are defined in [RFC3986].\
    \  An NSS\n      for the MEID is defined under the '3gpp2' NID.  The representation\n\
    \      of the MEID is a specific number of hexadecimal digits, as\n      described\
    \ in [S.R0048-A].  The formal definition of a URN with\n      'meid' NSS contains\
    \ one meidval with the formal definition\n      according to the following ABNF\
    \ [RFC5234]:\n      meidval           = Manufacturer-Code \"-\" Serial-Number\n\
    \      Manufacturer-Code = 8HEX\n      Serial-Number     = 6HEX\n      HEX   \
    \            = DIGIT / \"A\" / \"B\" / \"C\" / \"D\" / \"E\" / \"F\"\n   Assignment:\
    \  The manufacturer code and serial number portions of the\n      MEID are permanently\
    \ stored in the mobile equipment, so they\n      remain persistent as long as\
    \ the mobile equipment exists.  The\n      process for manufacturer code and serial\
    \ number assignment is\n      documented in [SC.R4002-0] and the manufacturer\
    \ code and serial\n      number values once assigned are not reassigned to other\
    \ pieces of\n      mobile equipment.\n      Identifiers in the '3gpp2' namespace\
    \ are defined and assigned by\n      the 3GPP2 or an agency appointed by 3GPP2\
    \ after ensuring that the\n      URNs to be assigned are unique.  Procedures are\
    \ in place to ensure\n      that each MEID is uniquely assigned by the mobile\
    \ equipment\n      manufacturer so that it is guaranteed to uniquely identify\
    \ that\n      particular piece of mobile equipment.\n   Security and Privacy:\
    \  See Section 6 of RFC 8464.\n   Interoperability:  Although both the 3GPP2 Mobile\
    \ Equipment Identity\n      (MEID) and the 3GPP International Mobile station Equipment\n\
    \      Identity (IMEI) are used to identify mobile equipment, they are\n     \
    \ separate identifiers and are not to be confused.\n      Internet implementations\
    \ will not generally possess MEID\n      identifiers.  The identifiers generated\
    \ by such implementations\n      will typically be URNs within namespaces other\
    \ than '3gpp2', and\n      may, depending on context, even be non-URN URIs.  Implementations\n\
    \      are advised to be ready to process URIs other than '3gpp2'\n      namespace\
    \ URNs, so as to aid in interoperability.\n   Resolution:  No resolution is envisioned.\n\
    \   Documentation:  Documentation can be found in the following\n      specifications:\n\
    \      *  \"A URN Namespace for Device Identity and Mobile Equipment\n       \
    \  Identity (MEID)\" [RFC8464].\n      *  \"3G Mobile Equipment Identifier (MEID)\
    \ - Stage 1\" [S.R0048-A].\n      *  \"GHA (Global Hexadecimal Administrator)\

    \ (MEID) and Short\n         Form Expanded UIM Identifier (SF_EUIMID)\" [SC.R4002-0].\n\
    \   Additional Information:  Because the syntax of a 3GPP2 Mobile\n      Equipment\
    \ Identity (MEID) differs from that of a 3GPP\n      International Mobile station\
    \ Equipment Identity (IMEI), reuse of\n      the URN specified in RFC 7254 is\
    \ not possible.\n   Revision Information:  N/A\n"

- title: 6.  Security and Privacy Considerations
  contents:
  - "6.  Security and Privacy Considerations\n   An MEID is usually printed outside\
    \ of the box in which a mobile\n   device ships.  The MEID may also be printed\
    \ under the battery on a\n   mobile device; however, very few devices have removable\
    \ batteries\n   today.  One can retrieve the MEID via either settings or by dialing\n\
    \   *#06#.  Anyone with brief physical access to the mobile device or its\n  \
    \ box can easily obtain the MEID.  Therefore, MEIDs MUST NOT be used as\n   security\
    \ capabilities (identifiers whose mere possession grants\n   access).  Unfortunately,\
    \ there are currently examples of some\n   applications that are using the MEID\
    \ for authorization.  Also, some\n   service providers' customer service departments\
    \ have been known to\n   use knowledge of the MEID as \"proof\" that the caller\
    \ is the\n   legitimate owner of the mobile device.  Both of these are\n   inappropriate\
    \ uses of the MEID.\n   Since the MEID is permanently assigned to the mobile equipment\
    \ and is\n   not modified when the ownership of the mobile equipment changes (even\n\
    \   upon a complete software reload of the mobile equipment), the MEID\n   URN\
    \ MUST NOT be used as a user identifier or user address by an\n   application.\
    \  Using the MEID to identify a user or as a user address\n   could result in\
    \ communications destined for a previous owner of a\n   device being received\
    \ by the new device owner or could allow the new\n   device owner to access information\
    \ or services owned by the previous\n   device owner.\n   Additionally, since\
    \ the MEID identifies the mobile equipment, it\n   potentially could be used to\
    \ identify and track users for the\n   purposes of surveillance and call data\
    \ mining if sent in the clear.\n   Since the MEID is personally identifiable information,\
    \ uses of the\n   MEID URN with IETF protocols require a specification and IETF\
    \ expert\n   review [RFC8126] in order to ensure that the privacy concerns are\n\
    \   appropriately addressed.  Protocols carrying the MEID URN SHOULD, at\n   a\
    \ minimum, use strongly hop-by-hop encrypted channels, and it is\n   RECOMMENDED\
    \ that end-to-end encryption be used.\n"
