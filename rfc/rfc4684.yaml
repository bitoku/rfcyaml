  - "1.  Introduction\n   In BGP/MPLS IP VPNs, PE routers use Route Target (RT) extended\n\
    \   communities to control the distribution of routes into VRFs.  Within\n   a\
    \ given iBGP mesh, PE routers need only hold routes marked with Route\n   Targets\
    \ pertaining to VRFs that have local CE attachments.\n   It is common, however,\
    \ for an autonomous system to use route\n   reflection [2] in order to simplify\
    \ the process of bringing up a new\n   PE router in the network and to limit the\
    \ size of the iBGP peering\n   mesh.\n   In such a scenario, as well as when VPNs\
    \ may have members in more\n   than one autonomous system, the number of routes\
    \ carried by the\n   inter-cluster or inter-as distribution routers is an important\n\
    \   consideration.\n   In order to limit the VPN routing information that is maintained\
    \ at a\n   given route reflector, RFC 4364 [3] suggests, in Section 4.3.3, the\n\
    \   use of \"Cooperative Route Filtering\" [7] between route reflectors.\n   This\
    \ document extends the RFC 4364 [3] Outbound Route Filtering (ORF)\n   work to\
    \ include support for multiple autonomous systems and\n   asymmetric VPN topologies\
    \ such as hub-and-spoke.\n   Although it would be possible to extend the encoding\
    \ currently\n   defined for the extended-community ORF in order to achieve this\n\
    \   purpose, BGP itself already has all the necessary machinery for\n   dissemination\
    \ of arbitrary information in a loop-free fashion, both\n   within a single autonomous\
    \ system, as well as across multiple\n   autonomous systems.\n   This document\
    \ builds on the model described in RFC 4364 [3] and on\n   the concept of cooperative\
    \ route filtering by adding the ability to\n   propagate Route Target membership\
    \ information between iBGP meshes.\n   It is designed to supersede \"cooperative\
    \ route filtering\" for VPN\n   related applications.\n   By using MP-BGP UPDATE\
    \ messages to propagate Route Target membership\n   information, it is possible\
    \ to reuse all of this machinery, including\n   route reflection, confederations,\
    \ and inter-as information loop\n   detection.\n   Received Route Target membership\
    \ information can then be used to\n   restrict advertisement of VPN NLRI to peers\
    \ that have advertised\n   their respective Route Targets, effectively building\
    \ a route\n   distribution graph.  In this model, VPN NLRI routing information\n\
    \   flows in the inverse direction of Route Target membership\n   information.\n\
    \   This mechanism is applicable to any BGP NLRI that controls the\n   distribution\
    \ of routing information by using Route Targets, such as\n   VPLS [9].\n   Throughout\
    \ this document, the term NLRI, which expands to \"Network\n   Layer Reachability\
    \ Information\", is used to describe routing\n   information carried via MP-BGP\
    \ updates without any assumption of\n   semantics.\n   An NLRI consisting of {origin-as#,\
    \ route-target} will be referred to\n   as RT membership information for the purpose\
    \ of the explanation in\n   this document.\n"

    \                 Figure 1.  Topology of autonomous systems\n   Let's consider\
    \ the simple case of a VPN with CE attachments in ASes a\n   and i that uses a\
    \ single Route Target to control VPN route\n   distribution.  Ideally we would\
    \ like to build a flooding graph for\n   the respective VPN routes that would\
    \ not include nodes (c, g, h, j).\n   Nodes (c, j) are leafs ASes that do not\
    \ require this information,\n   whereas nodes (g, h) are not in the shortest inter-as\
    \ path between\n   (e) and (i) and thus should be excluded via standard BGP path\n\
    \   selection.\n   In order to achieve this, we will rely on ASa and ASi, generating\
    \ a\n   NLRI consisting of {origin-as#, route-target} (RT membership\n   information).\
    \  Receipt of such an advertisement by one of the ASes in\n   the network will\
    \ signal the need to distribute VPN routes containing\n   this Route Target community\
    \ to the peer that advertised this route.\n   Using RT membership information\
    \ that includes both route-target and\n   originator AS number allows BGP speakers\
    \ to use standard path\n   selection rules concerning as-path length (and other\
    \ policy\n   mechanisms) to prune duplicate paths in the RT membership information\n\
    \   flooding graph, while maintaining the information required to reach\n   all\
    \ autonomous systems advertising the Route Target.\n   In the example above, AS\
    \ e needs to maintain a path to AS a in order\n   to flood VPN routing information\
    \ originating from AS i and vice-\n   versa.  It should, however, as default policy,\
    \ prune less preferred\n   paths such as the longer path to ASi with as-path (g\
    \ h i).\n   Extending the example above to include AS j as a member of the VPN\n\
    \   distribution graph would cause AS f to advertise 2 RT Membership\n   NLRIs\
    \ to AS e, one containing origin AS i and one containing origin\n   AS j.  Although\
    \ advertising a single path would be sufficient to\n   guarantee that VPN information\
    \ flows to all VPN member ASes, this is\n   not enough for the desired path selection\
    \ choices.  In the example\n   above, assume that (f j) is selected and advertised.\
    \  Were that the\n   case, the information concerning the path (f i), which is\
    \ necessary\n   to prune the arc (e g h i) from the route distribution graph,\
    \ would\n   be missing.\n   As with other approaches for building distribution\
    \ graphs, the\n   benefits of this mechanism are directly proportional to how\
    \ \"sparse\"\n   the VPN membership is.  Standard RFC2547 inter-AS behavior can\
    \ be\n   seen as a dense-mode approach, to make the analogy with multicast\n \
    \  routing protocols.\n"

  contents:
  - "3.2.  Intra-AS VPN Route Distribution\n   As indicated above, the inter-AS VPN\
    \ route distribution graph, for a\n   given route-target, is constructed by creating\
    \ a directed arc on the\n   inverse direction of received Route Target membership\
    \ UPDATEs\n   containing an NLRI of the form {origin-as#, route-target}.\n   Inside\
    \ the BGP topology of a given autonomous-system, as far as\n   external RT membership\
    \ information is concerned (route-targets where\n   the as# is not the local as),\
    \ it is easy to see that standard BGP\n   route selection and advertisement rules\
    \ [4] will allow a transit AS\n   to create the necessary flooding state.\n  \
    \ Consider a IPv4 NLRI prefix, sourced by a single AS, which is\n   distributed\
    \ via BGP within a given transit AS.  BGP protocol rules\n   guarantee that a\
    \ BGP speaker has a valid route that can be used for\n   forwarding of data packets\
    \ for that destination prefix, in the\n   inverse path of received routing updates.\n\
    \   By the same token, and given that an {origin-as#, route-target} key\n   provides\
    \ uniqueness between several ASes that may be sourcing this\n   route-target,\
    \ BGP route selection and advertisement procedures\n   guarantee that a valid\
    \ VPN route distribution path exists to the\n   origin of the Route Target membership\
    \ information advertisement.\n   Route Target membership information that is originated\
    \ within the\n   autonomous-system, however, requires more careful examination.\n\
    \   Several PE routers within a given autonomous-system may source the\n   same\
    \ NLRI {origin-as#, route-target}, and thus default route\n   advertisement rules\
    \ are no longer sufficient to guarantee that within\n   the given AS each node\
    \ in the distribution graph has selected a\n   feasible path to each of the PEs\
    \ that import the given route-target.\n   When processing RT membership NLRIs\
    \ received from internal iBGP\n   peers, it is necessary to consider all available\
    \ iBGP paths for a\n   given RT prefix, for building the outbound route filter,\
    \ and not just\n   the best path.\n   In addition, when advertising Route Target\
    \ membership information\n   sourced by the local autonomous system to an iBGP\
    \ peer, a BGP speaker\n   shall modify its procedure to calculate the BGP attributes\
    \ such that\n   the following apply:\n   i.   When advertising RT membership NLRI\
    \ to a route-reflector client,\n        the Originator attribute shall be set\
    \ to the router-id of the\n        advertiser, and the Next-hop attribute shall\
    \ be set of the local\n        address for that session.\n   ii.  When advertising\
    \ an RT membership NLRI to a non-client peer, if\n        the best path as selected\
    \ by the path selection procedure\n        described in Section 9.1 of the base\
    \ BGP specification [4] is a\n        route received from a non-client peer, and\
    \ if there is an\n        alternative path to the same destination from a client,\
    \ the\n        attributes of the client path are advertised to the peer.\n   The\
    \ first of these route advertisement rules is designed such that\n   the originator\
    \ of an RT membership NLRI does not drop an RT\n   membership NLRI that is reflected\
    \ back to it, thus allowing the route\n   reflector to use this RT membership\
    \ NLRI in order to signal the\n   client that it should distribute VPN routes\
    \ with the specific target\n   towards the reflector.\n   The second rule allows\
    \ any BGP speaker present in an iBGP mesh to\n   signal the interest of its route\
    \ reflection clients in receiving VPN\n   routes for that target.\n   These procedures\
    \ assume that the autonomous-system route reflection\n   topology is configured\
    \ such that IPv4 unicast routing would work\n   correctly.  For instance, route\
    \ reflection clusters must be\n   contiguous.\n   An alternative solution to the\
    \ procedure given above would have been\n   to source different routes per PE,\
    \ such as NLRI of the form\n   {originator-id, route-target}, and to aggregate\
    \ them at the edge of\n   the network.  The solution adopted is considered advantageous\
    \ over\n   the former in that it requires less routing-information within a\n\
    \   given AS.\n"
- title: 4.  Route Target Membership NLRI Advertisements

    \ direct\n   clients.  By default, a reflector must scale in terms of the total\n\

    \ now possible to reduce the load imposed on\n   a given reflector by dividing\
    \ the PE routers present on its cluster\n   into a new set of clusters.  This\
    \ is a localized configuration change\n   that need not affect any system outside\

    \ the VPN\n   membership is.\n   The same policy mechanisms applicable to other\

    \   operator the option of controlling which VPN routes get advertised in\n  \
    \ an inter-domain border by filtering the acceptable RT membership\n   advertisements\

    \ can be performed according to the\n   dynamic Route Target membership information.\n\
    \   In some inter-as deployments, not all RTs used for a given VPN have\n   external\
    \ significance.  For example, a VPN can use a hub RT and a\n   spoke RT internally\
    \ to an autonomous-system.  The spoke RT does not\n   have meaning outside this\
    \ AS, so it may be stripped at an external\n   border router.  The same policy\
    \ rules that result in extended\n   community filtering can be applied to RT membership\
    \ information in\n   order to avoid advertising an RT membership NLRI for the\
    \ spoke-RT in\n   the example above.\n   Throughout this document, we assume that\
    \ autonomous-systems agree on\n   an RT assignment convention.  RT translation\
