  - "2.  Introduction\n   This document defines requirements for protocols used by\
    \ Network\n   Access Servers (NAS).  Protocols used by NAS's may be divided into\n\
    \   four spaces:  Access protocols, Network protocols, AAA protocols, and\n  \
    \ Device Management protocols.  The primary focus of this document is\n   on AAA\
    \ protocols.\n   The reference model of a NAS used by this document, and the analysis\n\
    \   of the functions of a NAS which led to the development of these\n   requirements,\
    \ may be found in [NAS-MODEL].\n"
- title: 3.  Access Protocol Requirements
  contents:
  - "3.  Access Protocol Requirements\n   There are three basic types of access protocols\
    \ used by NAS's.  First\n   are the traditional telephony-based access protocols,\
    \ which interface\n   to the NAS via a modem or terminal adapter or similar device.\
    \  These\n   protocols typically support asynchronous or synchronous PPP [PPP]\n\
    \   carried over a telephony protocol.  Second are broadband pseudo-\n   telephony\
    \ access protocols, which are carried over xDSL or cable\n   modems, for example.\
    \  These protocols typically support an\n   encapsulation method such as PPP over\
    \ Ethernet [PPPOE].  Finally are\n   the virtual access protocols used by NAS's\
    \ that terminate tunnels.\n   One example of this type of protocol is L2TP [L2TP].\n\
    \   It is a central assumption of the NAS model used here that a NAS\n   accepts\
    \ multiple point-to-point links via one of the above access\n   protocols.  Therefore,\
    \ at a minimum, any NAS access protocol MUST be\n   able to carry PPP.  The exception\
    \ to this requirement is for NAS's\n   that support legacy text login methods\
    \ such as telnet [TELNET],\n   rlogin, or LAT.  Only these access protocols are\
    \ exempt from the\n   requirement to support PPP.\n"
- title: 4.  Network Protocol Requirements
  contents:
  - "4.  Network Protocol Requirements\n   The network protocols supported by a NAS\
    \ depend entirely on the kind\n   of network to which a NAS is providing access.\
    \  This document does\n   not impose any additional requirements on network protocols\
    \ beyond\n   the protocol specifications themselves.  For example, if a NAS that\n\
    \   serves a routed network includes internet routing functionality, then\n  \
    \ that NAS must adhere to [ROUTING-REQUIREMENTS], but there are no\n   additional\
    \ protocol requirements imposed by virtue of the device\n   being a NAS.\n"

  contents:
  - "5.1.  General protocol characteristics\n   There are certain general characteristics\
    \ that any AAA protocol used\n   by NAS's must meet.  Note that the transport\
    \ requirements for\n   authentication/authorization are not necessarily the same\
    \ as those\n   for accounting/auditing.  An AAA protocol suite MAY use the same\n\
    \   transport and protocol for both functions, but this is not strictly\n   required.\n"

  contents:
  - "5.1.1.1.  Transport independence\n   The design of the AAA protocol MUST be transport\
    \ independent.\n   Existing infrastructures use UDP-based protocols [RADIUS],\
    \ gateways\n   to new protocols must be practical to encourage migration.  The\n\
    \   design MUST comply with congestion control recommendations in RFC\n   2914\
    \ [CONGEST].\n"
- title: 5.1.1.2.  Scalability
  contents:
  - "5.1.1.2.  Scalability\n   Very large scale NAS's that serve up to thousands of\
    \ simultaneous\n   sessions are now being deployed.  And a single server system\
    \ may\n   service a large number of ports.  This means that, in the extreme,\n\
    \   there may be an almost constant exchange of many small packets\n   between\
    \ the NASes and the AAA server.  An AAA protocol transport\n   SHOULD support\
    \ being optimized for a long-term exchange of small\n   packets in a stream between\
    \ a pair of hosts.\n   The protocol MUST be designed to support a large number\
    \ of ports,\n   clients, and concurrent sessions.  Examples of poor design would\n\
    \   include message identifiers which values are so small that queues and\n  \
    \ reception windows wrap under load, unique session identifier ranges\n   that\
    \ are so small that they wrap within the lifetime of potential\n   long sessions,\
    \ counter values that cannot accommodate reasonable\n   current and future bandwidth\
    \ usage, and computational processes with\n   high overhead that must be performed\
    \ frequently.\n"

  contents:
  - "5.1.1.3.  Support for Multiple AAA Servers and Failure Recovery\n   In order\
    \ to operationally support large loads, load balancing and\n   fail-over to multiple\
    \ AAA servers will be required.  The AAA protocol\n   MUST provide for NAS's to\
    \ balance individual AAA requests between two\n   or more AAA servers.  The load\
    \ balancing mechanism SHOULD be built in\n   to the AAA protocol itself.\n   The\
    \ AAA protocol MUST be able to detect a failure of the transport\n   protocol\
    \ to deliver a message or messages within a known and\n   controllable time period,\
    \ so it can engage retransmission or server\n   fail-over processes.  The reliability\
    \ and robustness of\n   authentication requests MUST be predictable and configurable.\n\
    \   The AAA protocol design MUST NOT introduce a single point of failure\n   during\
    \ the AAA process.  The AAA protocol MUST allow any sessions\n   between a NAS\
    \ and a given AAA server to fail-over to a secondary\n   server without loss of\
    \ state information.  This fail-over mechanism\n   SHOULD be built in to the AAA\
    \ protocol itself.\n"
- title: 5.1.1.4.  Support for Multiple Administrative Domains
  contents:
  - "5.1.1.4.  Support for Multiple Administrative Domains\n   NAS's operated by one\
    \ authority provide network access services for\n   clients operated by another\
    \ authority, to network destinations\n   operated by yet another authority.  This\
    \ type of arrangement is of\n   growing importance; for example, dial roaming\
    \ is now a nearly\n   ubiquitous service.  Therefore, the AAA protocol MUST support\
    \ AAA\n   services that travel between multiple domains of authority.  The AAA\n\
    \   protocol MUST NOT use a model that assumes a single domain of\n   authority.\n\
    \   The AAA protocol MUST NOT dictate particular business models for the\n   relationship\
    \ between the administrative domains.  The AAA protocol\n   MUST support proxy,\
    \ and in addition SHOULD support other multi-domain\n   relationships such as\
    \ brokering and referral.\n   The AAA protocol MUST also meet the protocol requirements\
    \ specified\n   in [ROAMING-REQUIREMENTS].\n"
- title: 5.1.2.  Attribute-Value Protocol Model
  contents:
  - "5.1.2.  Attribute-Value Protocol Model\n   Years of operational experience with\
    \ AAA protocols and NAS's has\n   proven that the Attribute-Value protocol model\
    \ is an optimal\n   representation of AAA data.  The protocol SHOULD use an Attribute-\n\
    \   Value representation for AAA data.  This document will assume such a\n   model.\
    \  Even if the AAA protocol does not use this as an on-the-wire\n   data representation,\
    \ Attribute-Value can serve as abstraction for\n   discussing AAA information.\n\
    \   Experience has also shown that attribute space tends to run out\n   quickly.\
    \  In order to provide room for expansion in the attribute\n   space, the AAA\
    \ protocol MUST support a minimum of 64K Attributes (16\n   bits), each with a\
    \ minimum length of 64K (16 bits).\n"
- title: 5.1.2.1.  Attribute Data Types
  contents:
  - "5.1.2.1.  Attribute Data Types\n   The AAA protocol MUST support simple attribute\
    \ data types, including\n   integer, enumeration, text string, IP address, and\
    \ date/time.  The\n   AAA protocol MUST also provide some support for complex\
    \ structured\n   data types.  Wherever IP addresses are carried within the AAA\n\
    \   protocol, the protocol MUST support both IPv4 and IPv6 [IPV6]\n   addresses.\
    \  Wherever text information is carried within the AAA\n   protocol, the protocol\
    \ MUST comply with the IETF Policy on Character\n   Sets and Languages [RFC 2277].\n"
- title: 5.1.2.2.  Minimum Set of Attributes
  contents:
  - "5.1.2.2.  Minimum Set of Attributes\n   At a minimum, the AAA protocol MUST support,\
    \ or be easily extended to\n   support, the set of attributes supported by RADIUS\
    \ [RADIUS] and\n   RADIUS Accounting [RADIUS-ACCOUNTING].  If the base AAA protocol\
    \ does\n   not support this complete set of attributes, then an extension to\n\
    \   that protocol MUST be defined which supports this set.\n"
- title: 5.1.2.3.  Attribute Extensibility
  contents:
  - "5.1.2.3.  Attribute Extensibility\n   NAS and AAA development is always progressing.\
    \  In order to prevent\n   the AAA protocol from being a limiting factor in NAS\
    \ and AAA Server\n   development, the AAA protocol MUST provide a built-in extensibility\n\
    \   mechanism, which MUST include a means for adding new standard\n   attribute\
    \ extensions.  This MUST include a method for registering or\n   requesting extensions\
    \ through IANA, so that long-term working group\n   involvement is not required\
    \ to create new attribute types.  Ideally,\n   the AAA protocol SHOULD separate\
    \ specification of the transport from\n   specification of the attributes.\n \
    \  The AAA protocol MUST include a means for individual vendors to add\n   value\
    \ through vendor-specific attributes and SHOULD include support\n   for vendor-specific\
    \ data types.\n"

  contents:
  - "5.1.3.1.  Mutual Authentication\n   It is poor security practice for a NAS to\
    \ communicate with an AAA\n   server that is not trusted, and vice versa.  The\
    \ AAA protocol MUST\n   provide mutual authentication between AAA server and NAS.\n"
- title: 5.1.3.2.  Shared Secrets
  contents:
  - "5.1.3.2.  Shared Secrets\n   At a minimum, the AAA protocol SHOULD support use\
    \ of a secret shared\n   pairwise between each NAS and AAA server to mutually\
    \ verify identity.\n   This is intended for small-scale deployments.  The protocol\
    \ MAY\n   provide stronger mutual security techniques.\n"
- title: 5.1.3.3.  Public Key Security
  contents:
  - "5.1.3.3.  Public Key Security\n   AAA server/NAS identity verification based\
    \ solely on shared secrets\n   can be difficult to deploy properly at large scale,\
    \ and it can be\n   tempting for NAS operators to use a single shared secret (that\
    \ rarely\n   changes) across all NAS's.  This can lead to an easy compromise of\n\
    \   the secret.  Therefore, the AAA protocol MUST also support mutual\n   verification\
    \ of identity using a public-key infrastructure that\n   supports expiration and\
    \ revocation of keys.\n"
- title: 5.1.3.4.  Encryption of Attributes
  contents:
  - "5.1.3.4.  Encryption of Attributes\n   Some attributes are more operationally\
    \ sensitive than others.  Also,\n   in a multi-domain scenario, attributes may\
    \ be inserted by servers\n   from different administrative domains.  Therefore,\
    \ the AAA protocol\n   MUST support selective encryption of attributes on an attribute-by-\n\
    \   attribute basis, even within the same message.  This requirement\n   applies\
    \ equally to Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting\n   data.\n"

  contents:
  - "5.4.1.1.  Guaranteed Delivery\n   The accounting and auditing functions of the\
    \ AAA protocol are used\n   for network planning, resource management, policy\
    \ decisions, and\n   other functions that require accurate knowledge of the state\
    \ of the\n   NAS.  NAS operators need to be able to engineer their network usage\n\
    \   measurement systems to a predictable level of accuracy.  Therefore,\n   an\
    \ AAA protocol MUST provide a means of guaranteed delivery of\n   accounting information\
    \ between the NAS and the AAA Server(s).\n"
- title: 5.4.1.2.  Real Time Accounting
  contents:
  - "5.4.1.2.  Real Time Accounting\n   NAS operators often require a real time view\
    \ onto the status of\n   sessions served by a NAS.  Therefore, the AAA protocol\
    \ MUST support\n   real-time delivery of accounting and auditing information.\
    \  In this\n   context, real time is defined as accounting information delivery\n\
    \   beginning within one second of the triggering event.\n"
- title: 5.4.1.3.  Batch Accounting

  contents:
  - "5.4.1.4.  Accounting Time Stamps\n   There may be delays associated with the\
    \ delivery of accounting\n   information.  The NAS operator will desire to know\
    \ the time an event\n   actually occurred, rather than simply the time when notification\
    \ of\n   the event was received.  Therefore, the AAA protocol MUST carry an\n\
    \   unambiguous time stamp associated with each accounting event.  This\n   time\
    \ stamp MUST be unambiguous with regard to time zone.  Note that\n   this assumes\
    \ that the NAS has access to a reliable time source.\n"
- title: 5.4.1.5.  Accounting Events
  contents:
  - "5.4.1.5.  Accounting Events\n   At a minimum, the AAA protocol MUST support delivery\

    \ of a user session\n      -  End of a user session\n      -  Expiration of a\
    \ predetermined repeating time interval during a\n         user session.  The\
    \ AAA protocol MUST provide a means for the\n         AAA server to request that\
    \ a NAS use a certain interval\n         accounting time.\n      -  Dynamic re-authorization\
    \ during a user session (e.g., new\n         resources being delivered to the\
    \ user)\n      -  Dynamic re-authentication during a user session\n"
- title: 5.4.1.6.  On-Demand Accounting
  contents:
  - "5.4.1.6.  On-Demand Accounting\n   NAS operators need to maintain an accurate\
    \ view onto the status of\n   sessions served by a NAS, even through failure of\
    \ an AAA server.\n   Therefore, the AAA protocol MUST support a means of requesting\n\
    \   current session state and accounting from the NAS on demand.\n"
- title: 5.4.2.  Accounting Attribute Requirements
  contents:
  - "5.4.2.  Accounting Attribute Requirements\n   At a minimum, the AAA protocol\
    \ MUST support delivery of the following\n   types of accounting/auditing data:\n\
    \      -  All parameters used to authenticate a session.\n      -  Details of\
    \ the authorization profile that was applied to the\n         session.\n     \
    \ -  The duration of the session.\n      -  The cumulative number of bytes sent\
    \ by the user during the\n         session.\n      -  The cumulative number of\
    \ bytes received by the user during the\n         session.\n      -  The cumulative\
    \ number of packets sent by the user during the\n         session.\n      -  The\
    \ cumulative number of packets received by the user during\n         the session.\n\

    \ AAA\n   information may need to cross trust boundaries.  In this situation,\
    \ a\n   NAS might operate as a shared device that services multiple\n   administrative\

    \ development and extension of an AAA protocol will be made much\n   easier if\
    \ new attributes and values can be requested or registered\n   directly through\
    \ IANA, rather than through an IETF Standardization\n   process.\n   The AAA protocol\
    \ might use enumerated values for some attributes,\n   which enumerate already-defined\
    \ IANA types (such as protocol number).\n   In these cases, the AAA protocol SHOULD\
    \ use the IANA assigned numbers\n   as the enumerated values.\n"
