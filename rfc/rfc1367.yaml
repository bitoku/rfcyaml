  - "Introduction\n   This memo suggests a schedule for the implementation of the\
    \ IP\n   network number allocation plan described in RFC 1366.  This schedule\n\
    \   is meant to support the implementation and deployment of an address\n   aggregation\
    \ mechanism for the Internet by proposing an achievable\n   target for which we\
    \ can all aim.  The timely deployment of that\n   aggregation mechanism and the\
    \ IP addressing plan will help the the\n   size of the Internet router forwarding\
    \ tables and management of the\n   IP address space.  By doing so, it will help\
    \ the current Internet\n   addressing and routing technology operate during the\
    \ interim period\n   until the next generation technology is deployed. This interim\n\
    \   solution in no way constrains the selection of the next generation\n   addressing\
    \ and routing technology.\n   This draft schedule was put together by the FNC\
    \ Engineering and\n   Planning Group (FEPG) based on the IP addressing plan BOF\
    \ of the July\n   1992 IETF meeting, as well as discussions with a number (though,\
    \ of\n   course, not all) of knowledgeable and interested parties, including\n\
    \   the IANA and IR.  This draft schedule assumes that the address\n   aggregation\
    \ mechanism will be available in the Internet by mid-1993.\n   The activities\
    \ described in this schedule are the precursors to that\n   deployment, and will\
    \ promote the efficient operation of that\n   mechanism.  We feel that our assumptions\
    \ are realistic and that this\n   schedule can be met.  We encourage its open\
    \ discussion as we move\n   toward community consensus.\n      Please send comments\
    \ to topolcic@nri.reston.va.us, or to the\n      mailing list ipalloc@nri.reston.va.us.\
    \  To be added to this\n      mailing list, send a request to ipalloc-request@nri.reston.va.us.\n\
    \   Note that the references below to an addressing plan and to criteria\n   for\
    \ regional address registries refer to RFC 1366.\n"

  - "Draft Implementation Schedule for IP Network Number Allocation Plan:\n      1)\
    \ 31 October 92:\n         The following address allocation procedures are continued:\n\
    \         a) Initial set of criteria for selecting regional address\n        \
    \    registries will be put into place, and requests from\n            prospective\
    \ regional registries will be accepted by the\n            IANA.\n         b)\
    \ Class A network numbers are practically impossible to\n            obtain.\n\
    \         c) Class B network numbers will continue to be issued only when\n  \
    \          reasonably justified.  If possible, a block of C's will be\n      \
    \      issued rather than a B. The requirements for allocating a\n           \
    \ Class B will become progressively more constrained until the\n            date\
    \ in step (3).\n         d) Class C network numbers will be allocated according\
    \ to the\n            addressing plan.  Allocation will be performed by the\n\
    \            Internet Registry (IR) if an appropriate regional registry\n    \
    \        has not yet been designated by the IANA.\n      2) 14 February 93:\n\
    \         Re-evaluate and readjust the schedule if necessary.\n      3) 15 April\
    \ 93:\n         a) The IR begins to allocate all networks according to the\n \
    \           addressing plan in appropriately sized blocks of Class C\n       \
    \     numbers.\n         b) Class B network numbers will be difficult to obtain,\n\
    \            following the recommendation of the addressing plan and only\n  \
    \          issued when justified.\n      4) 6 June 93:\n         Expected date\
    \ that an address aggregation mechanism is\n         available in the Internet.\n"
