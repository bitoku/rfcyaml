    the documents that describe the current\n   Internet-Standard Management Framework,
    please refer to section 7 of\n   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].\n   Managed objects are accessed
    via a virtual information store, termed\n   the Management Information Base or
    MIB.  MIB objects are generally\n   accessed through the Simple Network Management
    Protocol (SNMP).\n   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined
    in the\n   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB\n
    \  module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,\n   RFC
    2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580\n   [RFC2580].\n"

  - "3.  Short Overview of Fibre Channel\n   The Fibre Channel (FC) is logically a
    bidirectional point-to-point\n   serial data channel, structured for high performance.
    \ Fibre Channel\n   provides a general transport vehicle for higher-level protocols
    such\n   as Small Computer System Interface (SCSI) command sets, the High-\n   Performance
    Parallel Interface (HIPPI) data framing, IP (Internet\n   Protocol), IEEE 802.2,
    and others.\n   Physically, Fibre Channel is an interconnection of multiple\n
    \  communication points, called N_Ports, interconnected either by a\n   switching
    network, called a Fabric, or by a point-to-point link.  A\n   Fibre Channel \"node\"
    consists of one or more N_Ports.  A Fabric may\n   consist of multiple Interconnect
    Elements, some of which are\n   switches.  An N_Port connects to the Fabric via
    a port on a switch\n   called an F_Port.  When multiple FC nodes are connected
    to a single\n   port on a switch via an \"Arbitrated Loop\" topology, the switch
    port\n   is called an FL_Port, and the nodes' ports are called NL_Ports.  The\n
    \  term Nx_Port is used to refer to either an N_Port or an NL_Port.  The\n   term
    Fx_Port is used to refer to either an F_Port or an FL_Port.  A\n   switch port,
    which is interconnected to another switch port via an\n   Inter-Switch Link (ISL),
    is called an E_Port.  A B_Port connects a\n   bridge device with an E_Port on
    a switch; a B_Port provides a subset\n   of E_Port functionality.\n   Many Fibre
    Channel components, including the Fabric, each node, and\n   most ports, have
    globally-unique names.  These globally-unique names\n   are typically formatted
    as World Wide Names (WWNs).  More information\n   on WWNs can be found in [FC-FS].
    \ WWNs are expected to be persistent\n   across agent and unit resets.\n   Fibre
    Channel frames contain 24-bit address identifiers, which\n   identify the frame's
    source and destination ports.  Each FC port has\n   both an address identifier
    and a WWN.  When a Fabric is in use, the\n   FC address identifiers are dynamically
    assigned by a switch.  Each\n   octet of a 24-bit address represents a level in
    an address hierarchy,\n   with a Domain_ID being the highest level of the hierarchy.\n
    \  Each switch in a Fabric is assigned one (or more) unique Domain_IDs\n   using
    a two-step process.  First, one switch, called Principal\n   Switch, is selected
    from the switches of a Fabric.  Then, the\n   Principal Switch assigns Domain_IDs
    to the other switches of the\n   Fabric.  Address assignment within a domain is
    performed by the\n   switch to which that Domain_ID is granted.\n"
  title: 3.  Short Overview of Fibre Channel

  - "4.  Relationship to Other MIBs\n   The first standardized MIB for Fibre Channel
    [RFC2837] was focused on\n   Fibre Channel switches.  It is being replaced by
    the more generic\n   Fibre Channel Management MIB [FC-MGMT], which defines basic\n
    \  information for Fibre Channel hosts and switches, including\n   extensions
    to the standard IF-MIB [IF-MIB] for Fibre Channel\n   interfaces.  [FC-MGMT] includes
    the specification of how the generic\n   objects defined in [IF-MIB] apply to
    Fibre Channel interfaces.\n   Note that an interface's ifIndex value must be unique
    within an SNMP\n   context, irrespective of how many Fibre Channel management
    instances\n   (see below) and how many Fibre Channel switches are instrumented\n
    \  within that SNMP context.\n   This document defines the T11-FC-FABRIC-ADDR-MGR-MIB
    module, which\n   extends beyond [FC-MGMT] to cover the functionality, in Fibre
    Channel\n   switches, which is used to manage Fabric configuration, domains, and\n
    \  addresses within a domain.\n   This document also contains a MIB module, T11-TC-MIB,
    to define\n   textual conventions that might also be useful in other MIBs defined\n
    \  by T11.\n"
  title: 4.  Relationship to Other MIBs
- contents:
  - "5.  MIB Overview\n   This section explains the use of a Fibre Channel management
    instance,\n   a Switch Index, and a Fabric Index.  It also describes the six MIB\n
    \  groups contained in the MIB.\n"
  - contents:
    - "5.1.  Fibre Channel Management Instance\n   A Fibre Channel management instance
      is defined in [FC-MGMT] as a\n   separable managed instance of Fibre Channel
      functionality.  Fibre\n   Channel functionality may be grouped into Fibre Channel
      management\n   instances in whatever way is most convenient for the\n   implementation(s).
      \ For example, one such grouping accommodates a\n   single SNMP agent having
      multiple AgentX sub-agents, with each sub-\n   agent implementing a different
      Fibre Channel management instance.\n   The object, fcmInstanceIndex, is IMPORTed
      from the FC-MGMT-MIB\n   [FC-MGMT] as the index value to uniquely identify a
      Fibre Channel\n   management instance.\n"
    title: 5.1.  Fibre Channel Management Instance
  - contents:
    - "5.2.  Switch Index\n   The FC-MGMT-MIB [FC-MGMT] defines the fcmSwitchTable
      as a table of\n   information about Fibre Channel switches that are managed
      by Fibre\n   Channel management instances.  Each Fibre Channel management instance\n
      \  can manage one or more Fibre Channel switches.  The Switch Index,\n   fcmSwitchIndex,
      is IMPORTed from the FC-MGMT-MIB as the index value\n   to uniquely identify
      a Fibre Channel switch amongst those (one or\n   more) managed by the same Fibre
      Channel management instance.\n"
    title: 5.2.  Switch Index
  - contents:
    - "5.3.  Fabric Index\n   The [FC-SW-3] standard for an interconnecting Fabric
      consisting of\n   multiple Fabric Switch elements describes the operation of
      a single\n   Fabric in a physical infrastructure.  The current [FC-SW-4] standard\n
      \  also supports the operation of multiple Virtual Fabrics operating\n   within
      one (or more) physical infrastructures.  In such a scenario,\n   each Fabric
      has, of course, its own management instrumentation.  In\n   order to accommodate
      this scenario, this MIB module defines all\n   Fabric-related information in
      tables that are INDEXed by an arbitrary\n   integer, named a \"Fabric Index\".
      \ In a Fabric that is conformant to\n   [FC-SW-3], the value of this Fabric
      Index will always be 1.\n   It is quite possible, and may even become likely,
      that (a port of) a\n   Fibre Channel switch will be connected to multiple such
      Fabrics.\n   Thus, in order to simplify a query concerning all the Fabrics to\n
      \  which a single switch is connected, fcmSwitchIndex will be listed\n   before
      t11FamFabricIndex when they both appear in the same INDEX\n   clause.\n"

      the Fabric Address\n   Manager functionality within a switch, including its
      configuration\n   parameters that are per-interface (i.e., specified for a particular\n
      \  Fibre Channel interface identified by an ifIndex value).\n"

      Domain_ID via\n   a best-effort attempt for (short-term) re-assignment of the
      same FC\n   address identifiers.\n"

    title: 5.9.  The t11FamNotificationGroup Group
  - contents:
    - "5.10.  Use of RCF and BF\n   Included in [FC-SW-3] is the specification of
      Reconfigure Fabric\n   (RCF) and Build Fabric (BF), both of which are command
      codes of the\n   Switch Fabric Internal Link Service (SW_ILS).  [FC-SW-3] includes
      the\n   warning:\n      NOTE 13 - Since the RCF causes a complete reconfiguration
      of the\n      Fabric, and may cause addresses allocated to a Switch to change,\n
      \     this SW_ILS should be used with caution.  The BF SW_ILS allows the\n      Fabric
      to attempt reconfiguration without loss of or change of\n      address and therefore
      should be attempted before an RCF.  Examples\n      of situations in which RCF
      may be appropriate include resolution\n      of overlapped Domains, or the failure
      of a Fabric Reconfiguration\n      initiated by a BF.\n   Further, [FC-MI] specifies:\n
      \     A Fabric is prohibited from autonomously generating an RCF, but an\n      outside
      administrative function may request a switch to generate\n      an RCF.  Such
      an administrative function is outside the scope of\n      this technical report.\n
      \  The T11-FC-FABRIC-ADDR-MGR-MIB defined in this document is consistent\n   with
      both of the above quotes since it defines two objects,\n   t11FamAutoReconfigure
      and t11FamRestart, which are defined with a\n   MAX-ACCESS of read-write, and
      setting them to the appropriate value\n   is a means by which \"an outside administrative
      function may request a\n   switch to generate an RCF\" [FC-MI].\n   Note, however,
      the MIB specifies in its compliance section that the\n   minimum required level
      of support for these two objects is read-only.\n   Further, for both t11FamAutoReconfigure
      and t11FamRestart, the MIB\n   serves only as a request to generate; it does
      not represent the\n   action of the RCF or BF.  That is, a successful SNMP SetRequest
      on\n   these objects will cause an RCF (or BF) to be sent, but SNMP does\n   not/cannot
      ensure the successful operation of the SW_ILS operation.\n"

  - "11.  Security Considerations\n   There are a number of management objects defined
    in this MIB module\n   with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.
    \ Such\n   objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network\n
    \  environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure\n   environment
    without proper protection can have a negative effect on\n   network operations.
    \ These are the tables and objects and their\n   sensitivity/vulnerability:\n
    \        t11FamConfigDomainId, t11FamConfigDomainIdType and\n         t11FamContiguousAllocation
    -- ability to change the address\n         allocation policy.\n         t11FamRestart
    and t11FamAutoReconfigure -- ability to cause a\n         fabric reconfiguration,
    e.g., on certain error conditions.\n         t11FamPriority -- ability to affect
    which switch becomes the\n         Principal Switch.\n         t11FamRcFabricNotifyEnable
    -- ability to enable/disable a\n         notification.\n         t11FamIfRcfReject
    -- ability to change the switch's behavior on\n         receipt of an RCF.\n         t11FamIfRowStatus
    -- ability to change an interface\n         configuration parameter.\n   Some
    of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a\n   MAX-ACCESS
    other than not-accessible) may also be considered\n   sensitive or vulnerable
    in some network environments.  It is thus\n   important to control even GET and/or
    NOTIFY access to these objects\n   and possibly to even encrypt the values of
    these objects when sending\n   them over the network via SNMP.  These are the
    tables and objects and\n   their sensitivity/vulnerability:\n         t11FamTable
    and t11FamIfTable -- contain the configuration,\n         status, and statistics
    of the Fabric Address Manager.\n         t11FamAreaTable, t11FamDatabaseTable
    and t11FamFcIdCacheTable\n         -- contain information on currently assigned
    or recently-\n         released addresses.\n   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did
    not include adequate security.\n   Even if the network itself is secure (for example
    by using IPsec),\n   even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network
    is\n   allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects\n
    \  in this MIB module.\n   It is RECOMMENDED that implementors consider the security
    features as\n   provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8),\n
    \  including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for\n   authentication
    and privacy).\n   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT\n
    \  RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to\n   enable
    cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator\n   responsibility to
    ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an\n   instance of this MIB module
    is properly configured to give access to\n   the objects only to those principals
    (users) that have legitimate\n   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete)
    them.\n"
