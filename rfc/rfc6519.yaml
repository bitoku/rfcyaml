  - "Abstract\n   Dual-Stack Lite is a solution to offer both IPv4 and IPv6\n   connectivity\
    \ to customers that are addressed only with an IPv6\n   prefix.  Dual-Stack Lite\
    \ requires pre-configuration of the Dual-Stack\n   Lite Address Family Transition\
    \ Router (AFTR) tunnel information on\n   the Basic Bridging BroadBand (B4) element.\
    \  In many networks, the\n   customer profile information may be stored in Authentication,\n\
    \   Authorization, and Accounting (AAA) servers, while client\n   configurations\
    \ are mainly provided through the Dynamic Host\n   Configuration Protocol (DHCP).\
    \  This document specifies a new Remote\n   Authentication Dial-In User Service\
    \ (RADIUS) attribute to carry the\n   Dual-Stack Lite AFTR tunnel name; the RADIUS\
    \ attribute is defined\n   based on the equivalent DHCPv6 OPTION_AFTR_NAME option.\
    \  This RADIUS\n   attribute is meant to be used between the RADIUS server and\
    \ the\n   Network Access Server (NAS); it is not intended to be used directly\n\
    \   between the B4 element and the RADIUS server.\n"

  - "1.  Introduction\n   Dual-Stack Lite [RFC6333] is a solution to offer both IPv4\
    \ and IPv6\n   connectivity to customers that are addressed only with an IPv6\
    \ prefix\n   (no IPv4 address is assigned to the attachment device).  One of its\n\
    \   key components is an IPv4-over-IPv6 tunnel, but a Dual-Stack-Lite\n   Basic\
    \ Bridging BroadBand (B4) element will not know if the network to\n   which it\
    \ is attached offers Dual-Stack Lite support.  Even if the B4\n   did know, it\
    \ would not know the remote end of the tunnel to which it\n   could establish\
    \ a connection.\n   To inform the B4 element of the location of the Address Family\n\
    \   Transition Router (AFTR), a Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) may be\n  \
    \ used.  Once this information is conveyed, the presence of the\n   configuration\
    \ indicating the AFTR's location also informs a host to\n   initiate Dual-Stack\
    \ Lite (DS-Lite) service and become a Softwire\n   Initiator.\n   [RFC6334] specifies\
    \ a DHCPv6 option that is meant to be used by a\n   DS-Lite client (B4 element)\
    \ to discover its AFTR name.  In order to\n   be able to populate such an option,\
    \ the DHCPv6 server must be\n   pre-provisioned with the AFTR name.\n   In broadband\
    \ environments, a customer profile may be managed by\n   Authentication, Authorization,\
    \ and Accounting (AAA) servers, together\n   with AAA for users.  The Remote Authentication\
    \ Dial-In User Service\n   (RADIUS) protocol [RFC2865] is usually used by AAA\
    \ servers to\n   communicate with network elements.  [RADIUS-IPv6] describes a\
    \ typical\n   broadband network scenario in which the Network Access Server (NAS)\n\
    \   acts as the access gateway for the users (hosts or Customer Premises\n   Equipment\
    \ (CPE) devices) and also embeds a DHCPv6 server function\n   that allows it to\
    \ locally handle any DHCPv6 requests issued by the\n   clients.\n   Since the\
    \ DS-Lite AFTR information can be stored in AAA servers and\n   the client configuration\
    \ is mainly provided through DHCP running\n   between the NAS and the requesting\
    \ clients, a new RADIUS attribute is\n   needed to send AFTR information from\
    \ the AAA server to the NAS.\n   This document defines a new RADIUS attribute\
    \ to be used for carrying\n   the DS-Lite Tunnel Name, based on the equivalent\
    \ DHCPv6 option\n   already specified in [RFC6334].\n"

  - "3.  DS-Lite Configuration with RADIUS and DHCPv6\n   Figure 1 illustrates how\
    \ the RADIUS protocol and DHCPv6 work together\n   to accomplish DS-Lite configuration\
    \ on the B4 element when a PPP\n   session is used to provide connectivity to\
    \ the user.\n   The NAS operates as a client of RADIUS and as a DHCP Server. \
    \ The NAS\n   initially sends a RADIUS Access-Request message to the RADIUS server,\n\
    \   requesting authentication.  Once the RADIUS server receives the\n   request,\
    \ it validates the sending client, and if the request is\n   approved, the AAA\
    \ server replies with an Access-Accept message\n   including a list of attribute-value\
    \ pairs that describe the\n   parameters to be used for this session.  This list\
    \ MAY also contain\n   the AFTR tunnel name.  When the NAS receives a DHCPv6 client\
    \ request\n   containing the DS-Lite tunnel option, the NAS SHALL use the name\n\
    \   returned in the RADIUS DS-Lite-Tunnel-Name attribute to populate the\n   DHCPv6\
    \ OPTION_AFTR_NAME option in the DHCPv6 reply message.\n       B4            \

    \ and DHCPv6 Message Flow for an IP Session\n   In the scenario depicted in Figure\
    \ 2, the Access-Request packet\n   contains a Service-Type attribute with the\
    \ value Authorize Only (17);\n   thus, according to [RFC5080], the Access-Request\
    \ packet MUST contain\n   a State attribute.\n   After receiving the DS-Lite-Tunnel-Name\
    \ attribute in the initial\n   Access-Accept packet, the NAS MUST store the received\
    \ AFTR tunnel\n   name locally.  When the B4 sends a DHCPv6 Renew message to request\
    \ an\n   extension of the lifetimes for the assigned address or prefix, the\n\
    \   NAS does not have to initiate a new Access-Request packet towards the\n  \
    \ AAA server to request the AFTR tunnel name.  The NAS retrieves the\n   previously\
    \ stored AFTR tunnel name and uses it in its reply.\n   According to [RFC3315],\
    \ if the DHCPv6 server to which the DHCPv6\n   Renew message was sent at time\
    \ T1 has not responded, the DHCPv6\n   client initiates a Rebind/Reply message\
    \ exchange with any available\n   server.  In this scenario, the NAS receiving\
    \ the DHCPv6 Rebind\n   message MUST initiate a new Access-Request message towards\
    \ the AAA\n   server.  The NAS MAY include the DS-Lite-Tunnel-Name attribute in\
    \ its\n   Access-Request message.\n   If the NAS does not receive the DS-Lite-Tunnel-Name\
    \ attribute in the\n   Access-Accept message, it MAY fall back to a pre-configured\
    \ default\n   tunnel name, if any.  If the NAS does not have any pre-configured\n\
    \   default tunnel name or if the NAS receives an Access-Reject message,\n   the\
    \ IPv4-over-IPv6 tunnel cannot be established; thus, the B4 element\n   has only\
    \ IPv6 connectivity.\n"

  contents:
  - "4.1.  DS-Lite-Tunnel-Name\n   The DS-Lite-Tunnel-Name RADIUS attribute contains\
    \ an FQDN that refers\n   to the AFTR to which the client is requested to establish\
    \ a\n   connection.  The NAS SHALL use the name returned in the RADIUS\n   DS-Lite-Tunnel-Name\
    \ attribute to populate the DHCPv6 OPTION_AFTR_NAME\n   option [RFC6334].\n  \
    \ This attribute MAY be used in Access-Request packets as a hint to the\n   RADIUS\
    \ server; for example, if the NAS is pre-configured with a\n   default tunnel\
    \ name, this name MAY be inserted in the attribute.  The\n   RADIUS server MAY\
    \ ignore the hint sent by the NAS, and it MAY assign\n   a different AFTR tunnel\
    \ name.\n   If the NAS includes the DS-Lite-Tunnel-Name attribute, but the AAA\n\
    \   server does not recognize it, this attribute MUST be ignored by the\n   AAA\
    \ server.\n   If the NAS does not receive the DS-Lite-Tunnel-Name attribute in\
    \ the\n   Access-Accept message, it MAY fall back to a pre-configured default\n\
    \   tunnel name, if any.  If the NAS does not have any pre-configured\n   default\
    \ tunnel name, the tunnel cannot be established.\n   If the NAS is pre-provisioned\
    \ with a default AFTR tunnel name and the\n   AFTR tunnel name received in the\
    \ Access-Accept message is different\n   from the configured default, then the\
    \ AFTR tunnel name received in\n   the Access-Accept message MUST be used for\
    \ the session.\n   If the NAS cannot support the received AFTR tunnel name for\
    \ any\n   reason, the tunnel SHOULD NOT be established.\n   When the Access-Request\
    \ message is triggered by a DHCPv6 Rebind\n   message, if the AFTR tunnel name\
    \ received in the Access-Accept\n   message is different from the currently used\
    \ one for that session,\n   the NAS MUST force the B4 to re-establish the tunnel\
    \ using the new\n   AFTR name received in the Access-Accept message.\n   If an\
    \ implementation includes Change-of-Authorization (CoA) messages\n   [RFC5176],\
    \ they could be used to modify the current established\n   DS-Lite tunnel.  When\
    \ the NAS receives a CoA Request message\n   containing the DS-Lite-Tunnel-Name\
    \ attribute, the NAS MUST send a\n   Reconfigure message to a B4 to inform the\
    \ B4 that the NAS has new or\n   updated configuration parameters and that the\
    \ B4 is to initiate a\n   Renew/Reply or Information-Request/Reply transaction\
    \ with the NAS in\n   order to receive the updated information.\n   Upon receiving\
    \ an AFTR tunnel name different from the currently used\n   one, the B4 MUST terminate\
    \ the current DS-Lite tunnel, and the B4\n   MUST establish a new DS-Lite tunnel\
    \ with the specified AFTR.\n   The DS-Lite-Tunnel-Name RADIUS attribute MAY be\
