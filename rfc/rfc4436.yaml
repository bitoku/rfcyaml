  - "1.  Introduction\n   The time required to detect movement between networks and
    to obtain\n   (or to continue to use) an operable IPv4 configuration may be\n
    \  significant as a fraction of the total handover latency in moving\n   between
    points of attachment.\n   This document synthesizes, from experience in the deployment
    of hosts\n   supporting ARP [RFC826], DHCP [RFC2131], and IPv4 Link-Local\n   addresses
    [RFC3927], a set of steps known as Detecting Network\n   Attachment for IPv4 (DNAv4).
    \ DNAv4 optimizes the (common) case of\n   re-attachment to a network that one
    has been connected to previously\n   by attempting to re-use a previous (but still
    valid) configuration,\n   reducing the re-attachment time on LANs to a few milliseconds.
    \ Since\n   this procedure is dependent on the ARP protocol, it is not suitable\n
    \  for use on media that do not support ARP.\n"

    - "1.1.  Applicability\n   DHCP is an effective and widely adopted mechanism for
      a host to\n   obtain an IP address for use on a particular network link, or
      to\n   re-validate a previously obtained address via DHCP's INIT-REBOOT\n   mechanism
      [RFC2131].\n   When obtaining a new address, DHCP specifies that the client
      SHOULD\n   use ARP to verify that the offered address is not already in use.\n
      \  The process of address conflict detection [ACD] can take as much as\n   seven
      seconds.  In principle, this time interval could be shortened,\n   with the
      obvious trade-off: the less time a host spends waiting to\n   see if another
      host is already using its intended address, the\n   greater the risk of inadvertent
      address conflicts.\n   Where the client successfully re-validates a previously
      obtained\n   address using the INIT-REBOOT mechanism, the DHCP specification
      does\n   not require the client to perform address conflict detection, so this\n
      \  seven-second delay does not apply.  However, the DHCP server may be\n   slow
      to respond or may be down and not responding at all, so hosts\n   could benefit
      from having an alternative way to quickly determine\n   that a previously obtained
      address is valid for use on this\n   particular link.\n   When the client moves
      between networks, the address re-validation\n   attempt may be unsuccessful;
      a DHCPNAK may be received in response to\n   a DHCPREQUEST, causing the client
      to restart the configuration\n   process by moving to the INIT state.  If an
      address previously\n   obtained on the new network is still operable, DNAv4
      enables the host\n   to confirm the new configuration quickly, bypassing restart
      of the\n   configuration process and conflict detection.\n   The alternative
      mechanism specified by this document applies when a\n   host has a previously
      allocated DHCP address, which was not returned\n   to the DHCP server via a
      DHCPRELEASE message, and which still has\n   time remaining on its lease.  In
      this case, the host may determine\n   whether it has re-attached to the logical
      link where this address is\n   valid for use, by sending a unicast ARP Request
      packet to a router\n   previously known for that link (or, in the case of a
      link with more\n   than one router, by sending one or more unicast ARP Request
      packets\n   to one or more of those routers).\n   The use of unicast ARP has
      a number of benefits.  One benefit is that\n   unicast packets impose less burden
      on the network than broadcast\n   packets, particularly on 802.11 networks where
      broadcast packets may\n   be sent at rates as low as 1 Mb/sec.  Another benefit
      is that if the\n   host is not on the link it hoped to find itself on, a broadcast
      ARP\n   Request could pollute the ARP caches of peers on that link.  When\n
      \  using private addresses [RFC1918], another device could be\n   legitimately
      using the same address, and a broadcast ARP Request\n   could disrupt its communications,
      causing TCP connections to be\n   broken, and similar problems.  Also, using
      a unicast ARP packet\n   addressed to the MAC address of the router the host
      is expecting to\n   find means that if the host is not on the expected link
      there will be\n   no device with that MAC address, and the ARP packet will harmlessly\n
      \  disappear into the void without doing any damage.\n   These issues that define
      the applicability of DNAv4 lead us to a\n   number of conclusions:\n      o
      \ DNAv4 is a performance optimization.  Its purpose is to speed\n         up
      a process that may require as much as a few hundred\n         milliseconds (DHCP
      INIT-REBOOT), as well as to reduce multi-\n         second conflict detection
      delays when a host changes networks.\n      o  As a performance optimization,
      it must not sacrifice\n         correctness.  In other words, false positives
      are not\n         acceptable.  DNAv4 must not conclude that a host has returned\n
      \        to a previously visited link where it has an operable IP\n         address
      if this is not in fact the case.\n      o  As a performance optimization, false
      negatives are acceptable.\n         It is not an absolute requirement that this
      optimization\n         correctly recognize a previously visited link in all
      possible\n         cases.  For example, if a router ignores unicast ARP Requests,\n
      \        then DNAv4 will not be able to detect that it has returned to\n         the
      same link in the future.  This is acceptable because the\n         host still
      operates correctly as it did without DNAv4, just\n         without the performance
      benefit.  Users and network operators\n         who desire the performance improvement
      offered by DNAv4 can\n         upgrade their routers to support DNAv4.\n      o
      \ As a performance optimization, where DNAv4 fails to provide a\n         benefit,
      it should add little or no delay compared to today's\n         DHCP processing.
      \ In practice, this implies that DHCP\n         processing needs to proceed
      in parallel.  Waiting for DNAv4 to\n         fail before beginning DHCP processing
      can greatly increase\n         total processing time, the opposite of the desired
      effect.\n      o  Trials are inexpensive.  DNAv4 performs its checks using small\n
      \        unicast packets.  An IPv4 ARP packet on Ethernet is just 42\n         octets,
      including the Ethernet header.  This means that the\n         cost of an unsuccessful
      attempt is small, whereas the cost of a\n         missed opportunity (having
      the right address available as a\n         candidate and choosing not to try
      it for some reason) is large.\n         As a result, the best strategy is often
      to try all available\n         candidate configurations, rather than try to
      determine which\n         candidates, if any, may be correct for this link,
      based on\n         heuristics or hints.  For a heuristic to offer the prospect
      of\n         being a potentially useful way to eliminate inappropriate\n         configurations
      from the candidate list, that heuristic has to\n         (a) be fast and inexpensive
      to compute, as compared to sending\n         a 42-octet unicast packet, and
      (b) have high probability of not\n         falsely eliminating a candidate configuration
      that could be\n         found to be the correct one.\n      o  Time is limited.
      \ If DNAv4 is to be effective in enabling low\n         latency handoffs, it
      needs to complete in less than 10 ms.\n         This implies that any heuristic
      used to eliminate candidate\n         configurations needs to take at most a
      few milliseconds to\n         compute.  This does not leave much room for heuristics
      based on\n         observation of link-layer or Internet-layer traffic.\n"

- contents:
  - "2.  Overview\n   On connecting to a new point of attachment, the host responds
    to a\n   \"Link Up\" indication from the link layer by carrying out the DNAv4\n
    \  procedure.\n   For each network that it connects to, it is assumed that the
    host\n   saves the following parameters to stable storage:\n   [1] The IPv4 and
    MAC address of one or more test nodes on the\n       network.\n   [2] The IPv4
    configuration parameters, including the DHCP client\n       identifier, assigned
    address, and lease expiration time.\n   From the set of networks that have operable
    IPv4 addresses associated\n   with them, the host selects a subset and attempts
    to confirm the\n   configuration for each network, using the reachability test
    described\n   in Section 2.1.\n   For a particular network, the host SHOULD use
    the addresses of local\n   routers (preferably default gateways) as its test nodes.
    \ If more\n   than one address is known, those addresses may be tested in parallel.\n
    \  In order to ensure configuration validity, the host SHOULD only\n   configure
    routes for which the next hop address passes the\n   reachability test.  Other
    routes SHOULD be re-learned.\n   DNAv4 does not significantly increase the likelihood
    of an address\n   conflict.  The reachability test is only carried out for a network\n
    \  when the host has previously completed conflict detection as\n   recommended
    in Section 2.2 of the DHCP specification [RFC2131] and\n   obtained an operable
    IPv4 configuration on that network.\n   Restrictions on sending ARP Requests and
    Responses are described in\n   Section 2.1.1.\n   One case where DNAv4 does increase
    the likelihood of an address\n   conflict is when:\n      o  a DHCP server hands
    out an address lease,\n      o  the host with that lease leaves the network,\n
    \     o  the DHCP server is power-cycled or crashes and is rebooted,\n      o
    \ the DHCP server, having failed to save leases to stable\n         storage, assigns
    that same address to another host, and\n      o  the first host returns and, having
    a still-valid lease with\n         time remaining, proceeds to use its assigned
    address,\n         conflicting with the new host that is now using that same\n
    \        address.\n   While Section 4 of the DHCP specification [RFC2131] assumes
    that DHCP\n   servers save their leases in persistent storage, almost no consumer-\n
    \  grade NAT gateway does so.  Short DHCP lease lifetimes can mitigate\n   this
    risk, though this also limits the operable candidate\n   configurations available
    for DNAv4 to try.\n"
  - contents:
    - "2.1.  Reachability Test\n   The host skips the reachability test for a network
      if any of the\n   following conditions are true:\n   [a] The host does not have
      an operable routable IPv4 address on that\n       network.  In this case, the
      reachability test cannot confirm that\n       the host has an operable routable
      IPv4 address, so completing the\n       reachability test would serve no purpose.\n
      \  [b] The host does not know the addresses of any test nodes on that\n       network.
      \ In this case, insufficient information is available to\n       carry out the
      reachability test.\n   [c] If DHCP authentication [RFC3118] is configured.  The
      reachability\n       test utilizes ARP, which is insecure.  Hosts that have
      been\n       configured to attempt DHCP authentication SHOULD NOT utilize the\n
      \      reachability test.  Security issues are discussed in Section 4.\n   [d]
      The contents of the DHCP Client Identifier option that the client\n       used
      to obtain the candidate configuration is different from the\n       DHCP Client
      Identifier option the client intends to present on\n       the interface in
      question.  In this case, it is anticipated that\n       a DHCP server would
      NAK any request made by the client to acquire\n       or extend the candidate
      configuration, since the two interfaces\n       are presenting differing identities.\n
      \  If the reachability test is successful, the host SHOULD continue to\n   use
      the operable routable IPv4 address associated with the confirmed\n   network,
      without needing to re-acquire it.  Once a valid reachability\n   test response
      is received, validation is complete, and additional\n   responses should be
      discarded.\n   If a DHCPv4 client is operational, it is RECOMMENDED that the
      host\n   attempt to obtain IPv4 configuration via DHCPv4 in parallel with the\n
      \  reachability tests, with the host using the first answer returned.\n   This
      ensures that the DNAv4 procedure will not result in additional\n   delay in
      the case where reachability tests fail, or where sending a\n   DHCPREQUEST from
      the INIT-REBOOT state, as described in Section 3.2\n   and 4.3.2 of the DHCP
      specification [RFC2131], completes more quickly\n   than the reachability tests.\n
      \  In situations where both DNAv4 and DHCP are used on the same link, it\n   is
      possible that the reachability test will complete successfully,\n   and then
      DHCP will complete later with a different result.  If this\n   happens, the
      implementation SHOULD abandon the reachability test\n   results and use the
      DHCP result instead, unless the address confirmed\n   via the reachability test
      has been manually assigned (see Section\n   2.4).\n   Where the reachability
      test does not return an answer, this is\n   typically because the host is not
      attached to the network whose\n   configuration is being tested.  In such circumstances,
      there is\n   typically little value in aggressively retransmitting reachability\n
      \  tests that do not elicit a response.\n   Where DNAv4 and DHCP are tried in
      parallel, one strategy is to\n   forsake reachability test retransmissions and
      to allow only the DHCP\n   client to retransmit.  In order to reduce competition
      between DNAv4\n   and DHCP retransmissions, a DNAv4 implementation that retransmits
      may\n   utilize the retransmission strategy described in Section 4.1 of the\n
      \  DHCP specification [RFC2131], scheduling DNAv4 retransmissions\n   between
      DHCP retransmissions.\n   If a response is received to any reachability test
      or DHCP message,\n   pending retransmissions are canceled.  It is RECOMMENDED
      that a DNAv4\n   implementation retransmit no more than twice.  To provide damping
      in\n   the case of spurious \"Link Up\" indications, it is RECOMMENDED that\n
      \  the DNAv4 procedure be carried out no more than once a second.\n"

      - "2.1.1.  Packet Format\n   The reachability test is performed by sending a
        unicast ARP Request.\n   The host MUST set the target protocol address (ar$tpa)
        to the IPv4\n   address of the node being tested, and the sender protocol
        address\n   field (ar$spa) to its own candidate IPv4 address.  The ARP Request\n
        \  MUST use the host MAC address as the source, and the test node MAC\n   address
        as the destination.  The host includes its MAC address in the\n   sender hardware
        address field (ar$sha) and sets the target hardware\n   address field (ar$tha)
        to 0.\n   If a valid ARP Reply is received, the MAC address in the sender\n
        \  hardware address field (ar$sha) in the ARP Reply is matched against\n   the
        target hardware address field (ar$tpa) in the ARP Request, and\n   the IPv4
        address in the sender protocol address field (ar$spa) of the\n   ARP Reply
        is matched against the target protocol address field\n   (ar$tpa) in the ARP
        Request.  If a match is found, then the host\n   continues to use that IPv4
        address, subject to the lease re-\n   acquisition and expiration behavior
        described in Section 4.4.5 of the\n   DHCP specification [RFC2131].\n   The
        risk of an address conflict is greatest when the host moves\n   between private
        networks, since in this case the completion of\n   conflict detection on the
        former network does not provide assurance\n   against an address conflict
        on the new network.  Until a host has\n   confirmed the operability of its
        IPv4 configuration by receipt of a\n   response to the reachability test,
        it SHOULD NOT respond to ARP\n   Requests and SHOULD NOT broadcast ARP Requests
        containing its address\n   within the sender protocol address field (ar$spa).\n
        \  Sending an ICMP Echo Request [RFC792] would not be an acceptable way\n
        \  of testing a candidate configuration, since sending any IP packet\n   generally
        requires an ARP Request/Reply exchange and, as explained\n   above, ARP packets
        may not be broadcast safely until after the\n   candidate configuration has
        been confirmed.  Also, where a host moves\n   from one private network to
        another, an ICMP Echo Request can result\n   in an ICMP Echo Response even
        when the MAC address has changed, as\n   long as the IPv4 address remains
        the same.  This can occur, for\n   example, where a host moves from one home
        network using prefix\n   192.168/16 to another one.  In addition, if the ping
        is sent with TTL\n   > 1, then an ICMP Echo Response can be received from
        an off-link\n   router.  As a result, if the MAC address of the test node
        is not\n   checked, the host can mistakenly confirm attachment, potentially\n
        \  resulting in an address conflict.  As a result, sending an ICMP Echo\n
        \  Request SHOULD NOT be used as a substitute for the reachability test.\n"

      parallel\n   with one or more reachability tests.  This is accomplished by\n
      \  entering the INIT-REBOOT state and sending a DHCPREQUEST to the\n   broadcast
      address, as specified in Section 4.4.2 of the DHCP\n   specification [RFC2131].\n
      \  If the host does not have an operable routable IPv4 address on any\n   network,
      the host enters the INIT state and sends a DHCPDISCOVER\n   packet to the broadcast
      address, as described in Section 4.4.1 of the\n   DHCP specification [RFC2131].
      \ If the host supports the Rapid Commit\n   Option [RFC4039], it is possible
      that the exchange can be shortened\n   from a 4-message exchange to a 2-message
      exchange.\n   If the host does not receive a response to a DHCPREQUEST or\n
      \  DHCPDISCOVER, then it retransmits as specified in Section 4.1 of the\n   DHCP
      specification [RFC2131].\n   As discussed in Section 4.4.4 of the DHCP specification
      [RFC2131], a\n   host in INIT or REBOOTING state that knows the address of a
      DHCP\n   server may use that address in the DHCPDISCOVER or DHCPREQUEST rather\n
      \  than the IPv4 broadcast address.  In the INIT-REBOOT state, a\n   DHCPREQUEST
      is sent to the broadcast address so that the host will\n   receive a response
      regardless of whether the previously configured\n   IPv4 address is correct
      for the network to which it has connected.\n   Sending a DHCPREQUEST to the
      unicast address in INIT-REBOOT state is\n   not appropriate, since if the DHCP
      client has moved to another\n   subnet, a DHCP server response cannot be routed
      back to the client\n   since the DHCPREQUEST will bypass the DHCP relay and
      will contain an\n   invalid source address.\n"

    - "2.3.  IPv4 Link-Local Addresses\n   DNAv4 applies only to previously configured
      addresses that had some\n   lease lifetime associated with them, during which
      lifetime the\n   address may be legitimately regarded as being reserved for
      exclusive\n   use by the assigned host.  DHCP-assigned addresses fit this\n
      \  description, but IPv4 Link-Local address [RFC3927] do not, since IPv4\n   Link-Local
      addresses are not handed out by an authoritative server\n   and do not come
      with any guaranteed usable lifetime.\n   A host's claim on an IPv4 Link-Local
      address is valid only as long as\n   that host remains connected to the link,
      actively defending against\n   probes for its chosen address.  As soon as a
      host shuts down, sleeps,\n   or otherwise disconnects from a link, it immediately
      relinquishes any\n   claim it may have had on any IPv4 Link-Local address on
      that link.  A\n   host wishing to reclaim a previously used IPv4 Link-Local
      address\n   MUST perform the full probing and announcement process required
      by\n   \"Dynamic Configuration of IPv4 Link-Local Addresses\" [RFC3927] and\n
      \  MUST NOT attempt to use DNAv4 as a shortcut to bypass that process.\n   Where
      the host does not have an operable routable IPv4 address on any\n   network,
      the host MAY configure an IPv4 Link-Local address prior to\n   entering the
      INIT state and sending a DHCPDISCOVER packet, as\n   described in Section 2.3
      of the DHCP specification [RFC2131].  Where\n   a host can confirm that it remains
      connected to a network on which it\n   possesses an operable routable IPv4 address,
      that address should be\n   used, and the IPv4 Link-Local address is deprecated,
      as noted in\n   Section 1.9 of the IPv4 Link-Local specification [RFC3927].\n
      \  Where a host has an operable routable IPv4 address on one or more\n   networks
      but the reachability test cannot confirm the configuration\n   and the DHCPv4
      client does not receive a response after employing the\n   retransmission algorithm,
      Section 3.2 of the DHCP specification\n   [RFC2131] states that the client MAY
      choose to use the previously\n   allocated network address and configuration
      parameters for the\n   remainder of the unexpired lease.\n"

    - "2.4.  Manually Assigned Addresses\n   An implementation may use DNAv4 to confirm
      the configuration of\n   manually assigned addresses.  However, special consideration
      is\n   required for this to produce reliable results, so it SHOULD NOT be\n
      \  enabled by default.\n   For the purposes of DNAv4, manually assigned addresses
      may be treated\n   as equivalent to DHCP-assigned addresses with an infinite
      lifetime.\n   This does not significantly increase the probability of an address\n
      \  conflict as long as the manually assigned address is reserved by the\n   DHCP
      server or is outside the scope of addresses assigned by a DHCP\n   server.  However,
      where the manually assigned address is within an\n   address scope utilized
      by a DHCP server, it is possible that the host\n   will be unavailable when
      the DHCP server checks for a conflict prior\n   to assigning the conflicting
      address.  In this case, a host utilizing\n   DNAv4 could confirm an address
      that had been assigned to another\n   host.\n   Typically, an address is manually
      assigned on a network because a\n   dynamically assigned address was not suitable
      for some reason.\n   Therefore, where DNAv4 and DHCP are run in parallel and
      DNAv4\n   confirms a manual configuration, it may be undesirable to allow this\n
      \  configuration to be overridden by DHCP, as described in Section 2.1.\n   However,
      packet loss may cause the reachability test to fail while\n   DHCP completes
      successfully, resulting in the host obtaining a\n   dynamic address where a
      static address is desired.  In order to\n   provide for reliable reconfirmation
      of manually assigned addresses,\n   reachability tests for manual configurations
      require a more\n   aggressive retransmission strategy than that detailed in
      Section 4.1\n   of the DHCP specification [RFC2131].  For example, shorter\n
      \  retransmission intervals and more persistent retransmissions may be\n   required.\n"

  - "3.  Security Considerations\n   Detecting Network Attachment for IPv4 (DNAv4)
    is based on ARP and\n   DHCP and inherits the security vulnerabilities of these
    two\n   protocols.\n   ARP [RFC826] traffic is not secured, so an attacker gaining
    access to\n   the network can spoof a response to the reachability test described\n
    \  in Section 2.1, leading the querier to conclude falsely that it is\n   attached
    to a network that it is not connected to.\n   Similarly, where DHCPv4 traffic
    is not secured, an attacker could\n   masquerade as a DHCPv4 server, in order
    to convince the host that it\n   was attached to a particular network.  This and
    other threats\n   relating to DHCPv4 are described in \"Authentication for DHCP\n
    \  Messages\" [RFC3118].\n   The effect of these attacks will typically be limited
    to denial of\n   service, unless the host utilizes its IP configuration for other\n
    \  purposes, such as security configuration or location determination.\n   For
    example, a host that disables its personal firewall based on\n   evidence that
    it had attached to a home network could be compromised\n   by spoofing of the
    DNAv4 reachability test.  In general, adjustment\n   of the security configuration
    based on DNAv4 is NOT RECOMMENDED.\n   Hosts that depend on secure IP configuration
    SHOULD NOT use DNAv4 but\n   SHOULD instead utilize DHCP authentication [RFC3118],
    possibly in\n   combination with the Rapid Commit Option [RFC4039].\n"
