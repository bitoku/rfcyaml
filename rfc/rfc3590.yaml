  - "Abstract\n   It has come to light that there is an issue with the selection of\
    \ a\n   suitable IPv6 source address for Multicast Listener Discovery (MLD)\n\
    \   messages when a node is performing stateless address\n   autoconfiguration.\
    \  This document is intended to clarify the rules on\n   selecting an IPv6 address\
    \ to use for MLD messages.\n"
- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   The original specification of the Multicast Listener Discovery\n\
    \   Protocol (MLD) for IPv6 [RFC 2710] mandates the use of a link-local\n   IPv6\
    \ source address for the transmission of MLD messages.  In\n   addition, MLD also\
    \ requires nodes to send MLD Report messages when\n   joining any IPv6 multicast\
    \ group (except the All-Nodes address and\n   addresses of scope less than 2).\n\
    \   These MLD requirements conflict with the use of IPv6 multicast within\n  \
    \ the Neighbor Discovery Protocol [RFC 2461].  For stateless\n   autoconfiguration,\
    \ as defined in [RFC 2462], a node is required to\n   join several IPv6 multicast\
    \ groups in order to perform Duplicate\n   Address Detection prior to its use.\
    \  Since the only address the node\n   has is tentative, and cannot be used for\
    \ communication, it does not\n   have a suitable address to utilize as a source\
    \ address.\n   This document will clarify the IPv6 source address selection rules\n\
    \   for use with MLD when no link-local addresses are available.\n"

- title: 3.  Justification
  contents:
  - "3.  Justification\n   In [RFC 2710], Section 3 requires that all MLD messages\
    \ be sent with\n   a valid link-local IPv6 source address.  However, a node in\
    \ the\n   process of performing duplicate address detection for its link-local\n\
    \   (LL) address will not have one available to use as a source address.\n   For\
    \ this reason, this document allows the unspecified address to be\n   used as\
    \ a source address for MLD messages being used during duplicate\n   address detection.\n\
    \   The discrepancies in the rules defined in [RFC 2710] and [RFC 2462]\n   has\
    \ led to implementation issues.  Several IPv6 implementations skip\n   sending\
    \ MLD Report messages during duplicate address detection\n   because they have\
    \ no valid link-local address.  This leads to\n   operational problems when a\
    \ node is attached to switches that perform\n   MLD snooping.  In this scenario,\
    \ duplicate address detection (DAD)\n   will complete successfully and collisions\
    \ can occur once the address\n   is put into use because switches may not have\
    \ forwarded the DAD\n   messages to all nodes on the link as required.  This document\
    \ fixes\n   this problem by specifying that MLD reports are to be sent using an\n\
    \   unspecified source address prior to DAD being started in order to\n   ensure\
    \ that messages sent to LL multicast addresses (e.g., including\n   MLD) are forwarded\
    \ to all appropriate nodes as required.\n"
- title: 4.  MLD Source Address Selection Guidelines
  contents:
  - "4.  MLD Source Address Selection Guidelines\n   An MLD speaking node is required\
    \ to choose a suitable IPv6 source\n   address for all MLD messages (Report, Done,\
    \ and Query).\n   MLD Query messages MUST be sent with a valid link-local address\
    \ as\n   the IPv6 source address.  If a node (router or host) receives a query\n\
    \   message with an IPv6 source address set to the unspecified address\n   (::),\
    \ it MUST silently discard the message and SHOULD log a warning.\n   MLD Report\
    \ and Done messages are sent with a link-local address as\n   the IPv6 source\
    \ address, if a valid address is available on the\n   interface.  If a valid link-local\
    \ address is not available (e.g., one\n   has not been configured), the message\
    \ is sent with the unspecified\n   address (::) as the IPv6 source address.\n\
    \   Once a valid link-local address is available, a node SHOULD generate\n   new\
    \ MLD Report messages for all multicast addresses joined on the\n   interface.\n\
    \   Routers receiving an MLD Report or Done message with the unspecified\n   address\
    \ as the IPv6 source address MUST silently discard the packet\n   without taking\
    \ any action on the packets contents.\n   Snooping switches MUST manage multicast\
    \ forwarding state based on MLD\n   Report and Done messages sent with the unspecified\
    \ address as the\n   IPv6 source address.\n"
- title: 5.  Source Address Selection Implications
  contents:
  - "5.  Source Address Selection Implications\n   In RFC 2710, MLD Report and Done\
    \ messages are required to have an\n   IPv6 source address that is link-local.\
    \  This memo augments that rule\n   by allowing these messages to contain the\
    \ unspecified address (::) as\n   the source address.\n   The behavior of RFC\
    \ 2710 implementations, when receiving a message\n   with a source address of\
    \ ::, is dependent upon how the implementation\n   treats the unspecified address.\
    \  That is, these messages will be\n   dropped if the implementation does not\
    \ consider the unspecified\n   address to be link-local in scope.\n   As the unspecified\
    \ address is only used when there is no link-local\n   address, RFC 2710 implementations\
    \ discarding these packets will have\n   no affect on the packet's sender as the\
    \ use should only be for\n   joining the link-local solicited-node multicast group\
    \ [RFC 2462].\n   There is an implication to senders with respect to joining other\n\
    \   multicast groups prior to the activation of a link-local address.\n   The\
    \ dropping of Reports using the unspecified address as a source\n   address could\
    \ cause a lack of multicast traffic that is expected by\n   the node.  This black\
    \ hole will be temporary until the node can send\n   a Report with a valid link-local\
    \ address.\n"
- title: 6.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "6.  Security Considerations\n   General security issues related to MLD are discussed\
    \ in [RFC 2710].\n   For hosts and routers, all received MLD messages from an\
    \ unspecified\n   source address are silently discarded.  This is the required\
    \ behavior\n   from [RFC 2710] and is not changed by this document.  Thus, the\n\
    \   changes have no new security impacts.\n   In the case of snooping switches,\
    \ multicast forwarding state will be\n   maintained based on Report and Done messages\
    \ sent with the\n   unspecified address as the source address.  However, the security\n\
    \   vulnerabilities in this scenario are similar to those describing\n   forged\
    \ messages in the security considerations section of [RFC 2710].\n"
