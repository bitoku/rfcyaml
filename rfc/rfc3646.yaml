- title: 6.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "6.  Security Considerations\n   The DNS Recursive Name Server option may be used\
    \ by an intruder DHCP\n   server to cause DHCP clients to send DNS queries to\
    \ an intruder DNS\n   recursive name server.  The results of these misdirected\
    \ DNS queries\n   may be used to spoof DNS names.\n   To avoid attacks through\
    \ the DNS Recursive Name Server option, the\n   DHCP client SHOULD require DHCP\
    \ authentication (see section\n   \"Authentication of DHCP messages\" in RFC 3315)\
    \ before installing a\n   list of DNS recursive name servers obtained through\
    \ authenticated\n   DHCP.\n   The Domain Search List option may be used by an\
    \ intruder DHCP server\n   to cause DHCP clients to search through invalid domains\
    \ for\n   incompletely specified domain names.  The results of these\n   misdirected\
    \ searches may be used to spoof DNS names.  Note that\n   support for DNSSEC [4]\
    \ will not avert this attack, because the\n   resource records in the invalid\
    \ domains may be legitimately signed.\n   The degree to which a host is vulnerable\
    \ to attack via an invalid\n   domain search option is determined in part by DNS\
    \ resolver behavior.\n   RFC1535 [7] contains a discussion of security weaknesses\
    \ related to\n   implicit as well as explicit domain searchlists, and provides\n\
    \   recommendations relating to resolver searchlist processing.  Section\n   6\
    \ of RFC1536 [5] also addresses this vulnerability, and recommends\n   that resolvers:\n\
    \   1. Use searchlists only when explicitly specified; no implicit\n      searchlists\
    \ should be used.\n   2. Resolve a name that contains any dots by first trying\
    \ it as an\n      FQDN and if that fails, with the names in the searchlist appended.\n\
    \   3. Resolve a name containing no dots by appending with the searchlist\n  \
    \    right away, but once again, no implicit searchlists should be\n      used.\n\
    \   In order to minimize potential vulnerabilities it is recommended\n   that:\n\
    \   1. Hosts implementing the domain search option SHOULD also implement\n   \
    \   the searchlist recommendations of RFC1536, section 6.\n   2. Where DNS parameters\
    \ such as the domain searchlist or DNS servers\n      have been manually configured,\
    \ these parameters SHOULD NOT be\n      overridden by DHCP.\n   3. A host SHOULD\
    \ require the use of DHCP authentication (see section\n      \"Authentication\
    \ of DHCP messages\" in RFC 3315) prior to accepting\n      a domain search option.\n"
