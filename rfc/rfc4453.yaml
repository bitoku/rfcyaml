  - "1.  Introduction\n   The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) [1] supports communications\n\
    \   across many media types, including real-time audio, video, text,\n   instant\
    \ messaging, and presence.  This communication is established\n   by the transmission\
    \ of various SIP requests (such as INVITE and\n   MESSAGE [3]) from an initiator\
    \ to the recipient, with whom\n   communication is desired.  Although a recipient\
    \ of such a SIP request\n   can reject the request, and therefore decline the\
    \ session, a SIP\n   network will deliver a SIP request to the recipient without\
    \ their\n   explicit consent.\n   Receipt of these requests without explicit consent\
    \ can cause a number\n   of problems in SIP networks.  These include amplification\
    \ attacks.\n   These problems have plagued email.  At the time of this writing,\
    \ most\n   SIP services are not interconnected, so the incidence of\n   amplification\
    \ attacks directed at SIP services is low compared to the\n   same attacks on\
    \ email services.  The SIPPING working group believes\n   it is necessary to address\
    \ these attacks proactively so the attacks\n   do not become as burdensome as\
    \ attacks on email have become.\n   This document elaborates on the problems posed\
    \ by the current open\n   model in which SIP was designed, and then goes on to\
    \ define a set of\n   requirements for adding a consent framework to SIP.\n"
- title: 2.  Problem Statement
  contents:
  - "2.  Problem Statement\n   In SIP networks designed according to the principles\
    \ of RFC 3261 [1]\n   and RFC 3263 [2], anyone on the Internet can create and\
    \ send a SIP\n   request to any other SIP user, by identifying that user with\
    \ a SIP\n   Uniform Resource Identifier (URI).  The SIP network will usually\n\
    \   deliver this request to the user identified by that URI.  It is\n   possible,\
    \ of course, for network services, such as call screening, to\n   block such messaging\
    \ from occurring, but this is not widespread and\n   certainly not a systematic\
    \ solution to the problem under\n   consideration here.\n   Once the SIP request\
    \ is received by the recipient, the user agent\n   typically takes some kind of\
    \ automated action to alert the user about\n   receipt of the message.  For INVITE\
    \ requests, this usually involves\n   delivering an audible alert (e.g., \"ringing\
    \ the phone\"), or a visual\n   alert (e.g., creating a screen pop-up window).\
    \  These indicators\n   frequently convey the subject of the call and the identity\
    \ of the\n   caller.  Due to the real-time nature of the session, these alerts\
    \ are\n   typically disruptive in nature, so as to get the attention of the\n\
    \   user.\n   For MESSAGE requests, the content of the message is usually rendered\n\
    \   to the user.\n   SUBSCRIBE [4] requests do not normally get delivered to the\
    \ user\n   agents residing on a user's devices.  Rather, they are normally\n \
    \  processed by network-based state agents.  The watcher information\n   event\
    \ package allows a user to find out that such requests were\n   generated for\
    \ them, affording the user the opportunity to approve or\n   deny the request.\
    \  As a result, SUBSCRIBE processing, and most\n   notably presence, already has\
    \ a consent-based operation.\n   Nevertheless, this already-existing consent mechanism\
    \ for SIP\n   subscriptions does not protect network agents against denial-of-\n\
    \   service (DoS) attacks.\n   A problem that arises when requests can be delivered\
    \ to user agents\n   directly, without their consent, is amplification attacks.\
    \  SIP\n   proxies provide a convenient relay point for targeting a message to\
    \ a\n   particular user or IP address and, in particular, forwarding to a\n  \
    \ recipient that is often not directly reachable without usage of the\n   proxy.\
    \  Some SIP proxy servers forward a single request to several\n   instances or\
    \ contacts for the same user or resource.  This process is\n   called \"forking\"\
    .  Another type of SIP server provides the SIP URI-\n   list service [5], which\
    \ sends a new copy of the same request to each\n   recipient in the URI-list.\
    \  Examples of URI-list services are\n   subscriptions to resource lists [6],\
    \ dial-out conference servers [8],\n   and MESSAGE URI-list services [7].  A SIP\
    \ URI-list service could be\n   used as an amplifier, allowing a single SIP request\
    \ to flood a single\n   target host or network.  For example, a user can create\
    \ a resource\n   list with 100 entries, each of which is a URI of the form\n \
    \  \"sip:identifier@target-IP\", where target-IP is the IP address to\n   which\
    \ the attack is to be directed.  Sending a single SIP SUBSCRIBE\n   request to\
    \ such a list will cause the resource list server to\n   generate 100 SUBSCRIBE\
    \ requests, each to the IP address of the\n   target, which does not even need\
    \ to be a SIP node.\n      Note that the target-IP does not need to be the same\
    \ in all the\n      URIs in order to attack a single machine.  For example, the\n\
    \      target-IP addresses may all belong to the same subnetwork, in\n      which\
    \ case the target of the attack would be the access router of\n      the subnetwork.\n\
    \   In addition to launching DoS attacks, attackers could also use SIP\n   URI-list\
    \ servers as amplifiers to deliver spam.  For INVITE requests,\n   this takes\
    \ the form of typical \"telemarketer\" calls.  A user might\n   receive a stream\
    \ of never-ending requests for communications, each of\n   them disrupting the\
    \ user and demanding their attention.  For MESSAGE\n   requests, the problem is\
    \ even more severe.  The user might receive a\n   never-ending stream of visual\
    \ alerts (e.g., screen pop-up windows)\n   that deliver unwanted, malicious, or\
    \ otherwise undesired content.\n   Both amplification attacks related to spam\
    \ and DoS can be alleviated\n   by adding a consent-based communications framework\
    \ to SIP.  Such a\n   framework keeps servers from relaying messages to users\
    \ without their\n   consent.\n      The framework for SIP URI-list services [5]\
    \ identifies\n      amplification attacks as a problem in the context of URI-list\n\
    \      services.  That framework mandates the use of opt-in lists, which\n   \
    \   are a form of consent-based communications.  The reader can find\n      an\
    \ analysis on how a consent-based framework helps alleviate\n      spam-related\
    \ problems in [9].\n"
- title: 3.  Requirements
  contents:
  - "3.  Requirements\n   The following identify requirements for a solution that\
    \ provides\n   consent-based communications in SIP.  A relay is defined as any\
    \ SIP\n   server, be it a proxy, Back-to-Back User Agent (B2BUA), or some\n  \
    \ hybrid, that receives a request and translates the request URI into\n   one\
    \ or more next-hop URIs to which it then delivers a request.\n   REQ 1:  The solution\
    \ must keep relays from delivering a SIP request\n      to a recipient unless\
    \ the recipient has explicitly granted\n      permission to the relay using appropriately\
    \ authenticated\n      messages.\n   REQ 2:  The solution shall prevent relays\
    \ from generating more than\n      one outbound request in response to an inbound\
    \ request, unless\n      permission to do so has been granted by the resource\
    \ to whom the\n      outbound request was to be targeted.  This requirement avoids\
    \ the\n      consent mechanism itself becoming the focus of DoS attacks.\n   REQ\
    \ 3:  The permissions shall be capable of specifying that messages\n      from\
    \ a specific user, identified by a SIP URI that is an Address-\n      of-Record\
    \ (AOR), are permitted.\n   REQ 4:  Each recipient AOR must be able to specify\
    \ permissions\n      separately for each SIP service that forwards messages to\
    \ the\n      recipient.  For example, Alice may authorize forwarding to her\n\
    \      from domain A, but not from domain B.\n   REQ 5:  It shall be possible\
    \ for a user to revoke permissions at any\n      time.\n   REQ 6:  It shall not\
    \ be required for a user or user agent to store\n      information in order to\
    \ be able to revoke permissions that were\n      previously granted for a relay\
    \ resource.\n   REQ 7:  The solution shall work in an inter-domain context, without\n\
    \      requiring preestablished relationships between domains.\n   REQ 8:  The\
    \ solution shall work for all current and future SIP\n      methods.\n   REQ 9:\
    \  The solution shall be applicable to forking proxies.\n   REQ 10:  The solution\
    \ shall be applicable to URI-list services, such\n      as resource list servers\
    \ [5], MESSAGE URI-list services [7], and\n      conference servers performing\
    \ dial-out functions [8].\n   REQ 11:  In SIP, URI-lists can be stored on the\
    \ URI-list server or\n      provided in a SIP request.  The consent framework\
    \ must work in\n      both cases.\n   REQ 12:  The solution shall allow anonymous\
    \ communications, as long\n      as the recipient is willing to accept anonymous\
    \ communications.\n   REQ 13:  If the recipient of a request wishes to be anonymous\
    \ with\n      respect to the original sender, it must be possible for the\n  \
    \    recipient to grant permission for the sender without the original\n     \
    \ sender learning the recipient's identity.\n   REQ 14:  The solution shall prevent\
    \ attacks that seek to undermine\n      the underlying goal of consent.  That\
    \ is, it should not be\n      possible to \"fool\" the system into delivering\
    \ a request for which\n      permission was not, in fact, granted.\n   REQ 15:\
    \  The solution shall not require the recipient of the\n      communications to\
    \ be connected to the network at the time\n      communications are attempted.\n\
    \   REQ 16:  The solution shall not require the sender of a SIP request\n    \
    \  to be connected at the time that a recipient provides permission.\n   REQ 17:\
    \  The solution should scale to Internet-wide deployment.\n"
