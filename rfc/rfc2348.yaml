- title: Abstract
  contents:
  - "Abstract\n   The Trivial File Transfer Protocol [1] is a simple, lock-step, file\n\
    \   transfer protocol which allows a client to get or put a file onto a\n   remote\
    \ host.  One of its primary uses is the booting of diskless\n   nodes on a Local\
    \ Area Network.  TFTP is used because it is very\n   simple to implement in a\
    \ small node's limited ROM space.  However,\n   the choice of a 512-octet blocksize\
    \ is not the most efficient for use\n   on a LAN whose MTU may 1500 octets or\
    \ greater.\n   This document describes a TFTP option which allows the client and\n\
    \   server to negotiate a blocksize more applicable to the network\n   medium.\
    \  The TFTP Option Extension mechanism is described in [2].\n"
- title: Blocksize Option Specification
  contents:
  - "Blocksize Option Specification\n   The TFTP Read Request or Write Request packet\
    \ is modified to include\n   the blocksize option as follows.  Note that all fields\
    \ except \"opc\"\n   are NULL-terminated.\n      |  opc  |filename| 0 |  mode\
    \  | 0 | blksize| 0 | #octets| 0 |\n      opc\n         The opcode field contains\
    \ either a 1, for Read Requests, or 2,\n         for Write Requests, as defined\
    \ in [1].\n      filename\n         The name of the file to be read or written,\
    \ as defined in [1].\n      mode\n         The mode of the file transfer: \"netascii\"\
    , \"octet\", or \"mail\",\n         as defined in [1].\n      blksize\n      \
    \   The Blocksize option, \"blksize\" (case in-sensitive).\n      #octets\n  \
    \       The number of octets in a block, specified in ASCII.  Valid\n        \
    \ values range between \"8\" and \"65464\" octets, inclusive.  The\n         blocksize\
    \ refers to the number of data octets; it does not\n         include the four\
    \ octets of TFTP header.\n   For example:\n      +-------+--------+---+--------+---+--------+---+--------+---+\n\
    \      |   1   | foobar | 0 | octet  | 0 | blksize| 0 |  1428  | 0 |\n      +-------+--------+---+--------+---+--------+---+--------+---+\n\
    \   is a Read Request, for the file named \"foobar\", in octet (binary)\n   transfer\
    \ mode, with a block size of 1428 octets (Ethernet MTU, less\n   the TFTP, UDP\
    \ and IP header lengths).\n   If the server is willing to accept the blocksize\
    \ option, it sends an\n   Option Acknowledgment (OACK) to the client.  The specified\
    \ value must\n   be less than or equal to the value specified by the client. \
    \ The\n   client must then either use the size specified in the OACK, or send\n\
    \   an ERROR packet, with error code 8, to terminate the transfer.\n   The rules\
    \ for determining the final packet are unchanged from [1].\n   The reception of\
    \ a data packet with a data length less than the\n   negotiated blocksize is the\
    \ final packet.  If the blocksize is\n   greater than the amount of data to be\
    \ transfered, the first packet is\n   the final packet.  If the amount of data\
    \ to be transfered is an\n   integral multiple of the blocksize, an extra data\
    \ packet containing\n   no data is sent to end the transfer.\n"

  - "Proof of Concept\n   Performance tests were run on the prototype implementation\
    \ using a\n   variety of block sizes.  The tests were run on a lightly loaded\n\

    \                    blocksize (octets)\n   The comparisons between transfer times\
    \ (without a gateway) between\n   the standard 512-octet blocksize and the negotiated\
    \ blocksizes are:\n      1024     2x   -32%\n      1428   2.8x   -42%\n      2048\
    \     4x   -54%\n      4096     8x   -71%\n      8192    16x   -80%\n   As was\
    \ anticipated, the transfer time decreases with an increase in\n   blocksize.\
    \  The reason for the reduction in time is the reduction in\n   the number of\
    \ packets sent.  For example, by increasing the blocksize\n   from 512 octets\
    \ to 1024 octets, not only are the number of data\n   packets halved, but the\
    \ number of acknowledgement packets is also\n   halved (along with the number\
    \ of times the data transmitter must wait\n   for an ACK).  A secondary effect\
    \ is the efficiency gained by reducing\n   the per-packet framing and processing\
    \ overhead.\n   Of course, if the blocksize exceeds the path MTU, IP fragmentation\n\
    \   and reassembly will begin to add more overhead.  This will be more\n   noticable\
    \ the greater the number of gateways in the path.\n"

  - "Security Considerations\n   The basic TFTP protocol has no security mechanism.\
    \  This is why it\n   has no rename, delete, or file overwrite capabilities. \
    \ This document\n   does not add any security to TFTP; however, the specified\
    \ extensions\n   do not add any additional security risks.\n"
