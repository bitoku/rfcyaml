For the past year UCSB has provided free use of the UCSB On line System to Network sites.
Recharges for this service are being paid for by the Computer Research Lab with funds out of our current ARPA contract.
Connect time for the month of April totaled 152 hours.
Presently, all users are running on the same account:
User Number 196, ID Code 57372, User Name ARPA.
As such, it is difficult to monitor the amount of use by each site.
Consequently, we are changing the login procedure for Network users, effective 1 June 72.
Commencing June 1, the new login parameters will be:
User Number 196 ID 57372 User Name <site destination
> (NIC ID will suffice).
The appropriate site designation is listed at the end of this RFC for each affilliation presently connected to the ARPA network.
Any site omitted from this list which plans on running at UCSB should contact me at (805) 961 3793.
Network users of the UCSB
On line System are reminded that these free accounts are provided for Network experimentation.
We also encourage use of this service on a casual basis inorder that users unfamiliar with the Culler Fried System may acquaint themselves with some of the facilities available.
However, sites intending to use the system on a production basis are requested to open a private account to which computer charges can be billed.
We will also continue to provide free remote batch support on a limited basis.
Again, this service is provided as a convenience to Network sites who are attempting to implement and debug Network software.
Sites submitting production jobs will be expected to open a Computer Center account and pay for computer charges billed to that account.
