Abstract This memo describes how the "authPassword" Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) attribute can be used for storing secrets used by the Salted Challenge Response Authentication Message (SCRAM) mechanism in the Simple Authentication and Security Layer (SASL) framework.
This document describes how the authPassword LDAP attribute [AUTHPASS] can be used for storing secrets used by [SCRAM] Simple Authentication and Security Layer [RFC4422]
The "scheme" part of the authPassword attribute is the SCRAM mechanism name (always without the " PLUS" suffix), e.g., "SCRAM  SHA 1".
See [SCRAM] for the exact syntax of SCRAM mechanism names.
The "authValue" part of the authPassword attribute is the base64
Syntax of the attribute can be expressed using ABNF [RFC5234].
Non  terminal references in the following ABNF are defined in either [AUTHPASS], [RFC4422], or [RFC5234].
Complies with ABNF for <scheme> ; defined in [AUTHPASS].
; A positive number without leading zeros.
; See definition in [SCRAM].
; See definition in [SCRAM].
"SCRAM " 1 9mech char ; Other SCRAM mechanisms registered ; in the IANA registry for SASL ; mechanism names.
> Note that the authPassword attribute is multivalued.
For example, it may contain multiple SCRAM hashes for different hashing algorithms.
Conventions Used in This Document
The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "

This document defines how the authPassword attribute can be used to store SCRAM secrets.
Therefore, security considerations relevant to [SCRAM] and hash functions used with it are also relevant to this document.
General security considerations related to the authPassword attribute (as specified in [AUTHPASS]) also apply to the use of authPassword as specified in this document.
In particular, the values of authPassword SHOULD be protected as if they were cleartext passwords.
A read operation on this attribute that is not protected by a privacy layer (such as IPsec or TLS) can expose this attribute to an attacker who a)
would be able to use the intercepted value to impersonate the user to all servers providing SCRAM access using the same hash function, password, iteration count, and salt or b) would be able to perform an offline dictionary or brute force attack in order to recover the user's password.
Servers MUST validate the format of the authPassword attribute before using it for performing a SCRAM authentication exchange.
It is possible that an attacker compromised the LDAP server or got access to the entry containing the attribute in order to exploit a vulnerability in the subsystem performing the SCRAM authentication exchange.
Big iteration counts and invalid base64 encoding are two possible (but not the only) exploits in the format specified in the document.
