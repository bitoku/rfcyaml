  - "Abstract\n   To allow efficient allocation of optical spectral bandwidth for\n\
    \   systems that have high bit-rates, the International Telecommunication\n  \
    \ Union Telecommunication Standardization Sector (ITU-T) has extended\n   its\
    \ Recommendations G.694.1 and G.872 to include a new Dense\n   Wavelength Division\
    \ Multiplexing (DWDM) grid by defining a set of\n   nominal central frequencies,\
    \ channel spacings, and the concept of the\n   \"frequency slot\".  In such an\
    \ environment, a data-plane connection is\n   switched based on allocated, variable-sized\
    \ frequency ranges within\n   the optical spectrum, creating what is known as\
    \ a flexible grid\n   (flexi-grid).\n   Given the specific characteristics of\
    \ flexi-grid optical networks and\n   their associated technology, this document\
    \ defines a framework and\n   the associated control-plane requirements for the\
    \ application of the\n   existing GMPLS architecture and control-plane protocols\
    \ to the\n   control of flexi-grid DWDM networks.  The actual extensions to the\n\
    \   GMPLS protocols will be defined in companion documents.\n"

- title: 1.  Introduction

  - "1.  Introduction\n   The term \"flexible grid\" (\"flexi-grid\" for short), as\
    \ defined by the\n   International Telecommunication Union Telecommunication\n\
    \   Standardization Sector (ITU-T) Study Group 15 in the latest version\n   of\
    \ [G.694.1], refers to the updated set of nominal central\n   frequencies (a frequency\
    \ grid), channel spacing, and optical spectrum\n   management and allocation considerations\
    \ that have been defined in\n   order to allow an efficient and flexible allocation\
    \ and configuration\n   of optical spectral bandwidth for systems that have high\
    \ bit-rates.\n   A key concept of flexi-grid is the \"frequency slot\": a variable-sized\n\
    \   optical frequency range that can be allocated to a data connection.\n   As\
    \ detailed later in the document, a frequency slot is characterized\n   by its\
    \ nominal central frequency and its slot width, which, as per\n   [G.694.1], is\
    \ constrained to be a multiple of a given slot width\n   granularity.\n   Compared\
    \ to a traditional fixed-grid network, which uses fixed-size\n   optical spectrum\
    \ frequency ranges or frequency slots with typical\n   channel separations of\
    \ 50 GHz, a flexible-grid network can select its\n   media channels with a more\
    \ flexible choice of slot widths, allocating\n   as much optical spectrum as required.\n\
    \   From a networking perspective, a flexible-grid network is assumed to\n   be\
    \ a layered network [G.872] [G.800] in which the media layer is the\n   server\
    \ layer and the optical signal layer is the client layer.  In\n   the media layer,\
    \ switching is based on a frequency slot, and the size\n   of a media channel\
    \ is given by the properties of the associated\n   frequency slot.  In this layered\
    \ network, a media channel can\n   transport more than one Optical Tributary Signal\
    \ (OTSi), as defined\n   later in this document.\n   A Wavelength Switched Optical\
    \ Network (WSON), addressed in [RFC6163],\n   is a term commonly used to refer\
    \ to the application/deployment of a\n   GMPLS-based control plane for the control\
    \ (e.g., provisioning and\n   recovery) of a fixed-grid Wavelength Division Multiplexing\
    \ (WDM)\n   network in which media (spectrum) and signal are jointly considered.\n\
    \   This document defines the framework for a GMPLS-based control of\n   flexi-grid\
    \ enabled Dense Wavelength Division Multiplexing (DWDM)\n   networks (in the scope\
    \ defined by ITU-T layered Optical Transport\n   Networks [G.872]), as well as\
    \ a set of associated control-plane\n   requirements.  An important design consideration\
    \ relates to the\n   decoupling of the management of the optical spectrum resource\
    \ and the\n   client signals to be transported.\n"

  contents:
  - "4.2.  Consideration of TE Links\n   From a theoretical point of view, a fiber\
    \ can be modeled as having a\n   frequency slot that ranges from minus infinity\
    \ to plus infinity.\n   This representation helps us understand the relationship\
    \ between\n   frequency slots and ranges.\n   The frequency slot is a local concept\
    \ that applies within a component\n   or element.  When applied to a media channel,\
    \ we are referring to its\n   effective frequency slot as defined in [G.872].\n\
    \   The association sequence of the three components (i.e., a filter, a\n   fiber,\
    \ and a filter) is a media channel in its most basic form.  From\n   the control-plane\
    \ perspective, this may be modeled as a (physical)\n   TE link with a contiguous\
    \ optical spectrum.  This can be represented\n   by saying that the portion of\
    \ spectrum available at time t0 depends\n   on which filters are placed at the\
    \ ends of the fiber and how they\n   have been configured.  Once filters are placed,\
    \ we have a one-hop\n   media channel.  In practical terms, associating a fiber\

  - "4.3.  Consideration of LSPs in Flexi-Grid\n   The flexi-grid LSP is a control-plane\
    \ representation of a media\n   channel.  Since network media channels are media\
    \ channels, an LSP may\n   also be the control-plane representation of a network\
    \ media channel\n   (without considering the adaptation functions).  From a control-plane\n\
    \   perspective, the main difference (regardless of the actual effective\n   frequency\
    \ slot, which may be dimensioned arbitrarily) is that the LSP\n   that represents\
    \ a network media channel also includes the endpoints\n   (transceivers), including\
    \ the cross-connects at the ingress and\n   egress nodes.  The ports towards the\
    \ client can still be represented\n   as interfaces from the control-plane perspective.\n\
    \   Figure 11 shows an LSP routed between three nodes.  The LSP is\n   terminated\
    \ before the optical matrix of the ingress and egress nodes\n   and can represent\

    \ 14: Topology View with TE Link or FA\n   Note that there is only one media-layer\
    \ switch matrix (one\n   implementation is a flexi-grid ROADM) in SSON, while\
    \ a signal-layer\n   LSP (network media channel) is established mainly for the\
    \ purpose of\n   management and control of individual optical signals.  Signal-layer\n\
    \   LSPs with the same attributes (such as source and destination) can be\n  \
    \ grouped into one media-layer LSP (media channel); this has advantages\n   in\
    \ spectral efficiency (reduced guard band between adjacent OChs in\n   one FSC\
    \ channel) and LSP management.  However, assuming that some\n   network elements\
    \ perform signal-layer switching in an SSON, there\n   must be enough guard band\
    \ between adjacent OTSi in any media channel\n   to compensate for the filter\
    \ concatenation effects and other effects\n   caused by signal-layer switching\
    \ elements.  In such a situation, the\n   separation of the signal layer from\
    \ the media layer does not bring\n   any benefit in spectral efficiency or in\
    \ other aspects, and it makes\n   the network switching and control more complex.\
    \  If two OTSi must be\n   switched to different ports, it is better to carry\
    \ them via different\n   FSC channels, and the media-layer switch is enough in\
    \ this scenario.\n   As discussed in Section 3.2.5, a media channel may be constructed\n\
    \   from a composite of network media channels.  This may be achieved in\n   two\
    \ ways using LSPs.  These mechanisms may be compared to the\n   techniques used\
    \ in GMPLS to support inverse multiplexing in Time\n   Division Multiplexing (TDM)\
    \ networks and in OTN [RFC4606] [RFC6344]\n   [RFC7139].\n   o  In the first case,\
    \ a single LSP may be established in the control\n      plane.  The signaling\
    \ messages include information for all of the\n      component network media channels\
    \ that make up the composite media\n      channel.\n   o  In the second case,\
    \ each component network media channel is\n      established using a separate\
    \ control-plane LSP, and these LSPs are\n      associated within the control plane\
    \ so that the endpoints may see\n      them as a single media channel.\n"

- title: 4.5.  Media Layer Resource Allocation Considerations
  contents:
  - "4.5.  Media Layer Resource Allocation Considerations\n   A media channel has\
    \ an associated effective frequency slot.  From the\n   perspective of network\
    \ control and management, this effective slot is\n   seen as the \"usable\" end-to-end\
    \ frequency slot.  The establishment of\n   an LSP is related to the establishment\
    \ of the media channel and the\n   configuration of the effective frequency slot.\n\
    \   A \"service request\" is characterized (at a minimum) by its required\n  \
    \ effective slot width.  This does not preclude the request from adding\n   additional\
    \ constraints, such as also imposing the nominal central\n   frequency.  A given\
    \ effective frequency slot may be requested for the\n   media channel in the control-plane\
    \ LSP setup messages, and a specific\n   frequency slot can be requested on any\
    \ specific hop of the LSP setup.\n   Regardless of the actual encoding, the LSP\
    \ setup message specifies a\n   minimum effective frequency slot width that needs\
    \ to be fulfilled in\n   order to successfully establish the requested LSP.\n\
    \   An effective frequency slot must equally be described in terms of a\n   central\
    \ nominal frequency and its slot width (in terms of usable\n   spectrum of the\
    \ effective frequency slot).  That is, it must be\n   possible to determine the\
    \ end-to-end values of the n and m\n   parameters.  We refer to this by saying\
    \ that the \"effective frequency\n   slot of the media channel or LSP must be\
    \ valid\".\n   In GMPLS, the requested effective frequency slot is represented\
    \ to\n   the TSpec present in the RSVP-TE Path message, and the effective\n  \
    \ frequency slot is mapped to the FlowSpec carried in the RSVP-TE Resv\n   message.\n\
    \   In GMPLS-controlled systems, the switched element corresponds to the\n   'label'.\
    \  In flexi-grid, the switched element is a frequency slot,\n   and the label\
    \ represents a frequency slot.  Consequently, the label\n   in flexi-grid conveys\
    \ the necessary information to obtain the\n   frequency slot characteristics (i.e.,\
    \ central frequency and slot\n   width: the n and m parameters).  The frequency\
    \ slot is locally\n   identified by the label.\n   The local frequency slot may\
    \ change at each hop, given hardware\n   constraints and capabilities (e.g., a\
    \ given node might not support\n   the finest granularity).  This means that the\
    \ values of n and m may\n   change at each hop.  As long as a given downstream\
    \ node allocates\n   enough optical spectrum, m can be different along the path.\
    \  This\n   covers the issue where media matrices can have different slot width\n\
    \   granularities.  Such variations in the local value of m will appear\n   in\
    \ the allocated label that encodes the frequency slot as well as in\n   the FlowSpec\
    \ that describes the flow.\n   Different operational modes can be considered.\
    \  For Routing and\n   Spectrum Assignment (RSA) with explicit label control,\
    \ and for\n   Routing and Distributed Spectrum Assignment (R+DSA), the GMPLS\n\
    \   signaling procedures are similar to those described in Section 4.1.3\n   of\
    \ [RFC6163] for Routing and Wavelength Assignment (RWA) and for\n   Routing and\
    \ Distributed Wavelength Assignment (R+DWA).  The main\n   difference is that\
    \ the label set specifies the available nominal\n   central frequencies that meet\
    \ the slot width requirements of the LSP.\n   The intermediate nodes use the control\
    \ plane to collect the\n   acceptable central frequencies that meet the slot width\
    \ requirement\n   hop by hop.  The tail-end node also needs to know the slot width\
    \ of\n   an LSP to assign the proper frequency resource.  Except for\n   identifying\
    \ the resource (i.e., fixed wavelength for WSON, and\n   frequency resource for\
    \ flexible grids), the other signaling\n   requirements (e.g., unidirectional\
    \ or bidirectional, with or without\n   converters) are the same as for WSON as\
    \ described in Section 6.1 of\n   [RFC6163].\n   Regarding how a GMPLS control\
    \ plane can assign n and m hop by hop\n   along the path of an LSP, different\
    \ cases can apply:\n   a.  n and m can both change.  It is the effective frequency\
    \ slot that\n       matters; it needs to remain valid along the path.\n   b. \
    \ m can change, but n needs to remain the same along the path.\n       This ensures\
    \ that the nominal central frequency stays the same,\n       but the width of\
    \ the slot can vary along the path.  Again, the\n       important thing is that\
    \ the effective frequency slot remains\n       valid and satisfies the requested\
    \ parameters along the whole path\n       of the LSP.\n   c.  n and m need to\
    \ be unchanging along the path.  This ensures that\n       the frequency slot\
    \ is well known from end to end and is a simple\n       way to ensure that the\
    \ effective frequency slot remains valid for\n       the whole LSP.\n   d.  n\
    \ can change, but m needs to remain the same along the path.\n       This ensures\
    \ that the effective frequency slot remains valid but\n       also allows the\
    \ frequency slot to be moved within the spectrum\n       from hop to hop.\n  \
    \ The selection of a path that ensures n and m continuity can be\n   delegated\
    \ to a dedicated entity such as a Path Computation Element\n   (PCE).  Any constraint\
    \ (including frequency slot and width\n   granularities) can be taken into account\
    \ during path computation.\n   Alternatively, A PCE can compute a path, leaving\
    \ the actual frequency\n   slot assignment to be done, for example, with a distributed\n\
    \   (signaling) procedure:\n   o  Each downstream node ensures that m is >= requested_m.\n\
    \   o  A downstream node cannot foresee what an upstream node will\n      allocate.\
    \  A way to ensure that the effective frequency slot is\n      valid along the\
    \ length of the LSP is to ensure that the same value\n      of n is allocated\
    \ at each hop.  By forcing the same value of n, we\n      avoid cases where the\
    \ effective frequency slot of the media\n      channel is invalid (that is, the\
    \ resulting frequency slot cannot\n      be described by its n and m parameters).\n\
    \   o  This may be too restrictive, since a node (or even a centralized/\n   \
    \   combined RSA entity) may be able to ensure that the resulting\n      end-to-end\
    \ effective frequency slot is valid, even if n varies\n      locally.  That means\
    \ that the effective frequency slot that\n      characterizes the media channel\
    \ from end to end is consistent and\n      is determined by its n and m values\
    \ but that the effective\n      frequency slot and those values are logical (i.e.,\
    \ do not map\n      \"direct\" to the physically assigned spectrum) in the sense\
    \ that\n      they are the result of the intersection of locally assigned\n  \
    \    frequency slots applicable at local components (such as filters),\n     \
    \ each of which may have different frequency slots assigned to them.\n   As shown\
    \ in Figure 15, the effective slot is made valid by ensuring\n   that the minimum\
    \ m is greater than the requested m.  The effective\n   slot (intersection) is\
    \ the lowest m (bottleneck).\n                            C                B \

    \ to infer that these considerations apply\n   and may be exacerbated in a flexi-grid\
    \ SSON system.  In particular,\n   the detailed and granular information describing\
    \ a flexi-grid network\n   and the capabilities of nodes in that network could\
    \ put stress on the\n   routing protocol or the out-of-band control channel used\
    \ by the\n   protocol.  An attacker might be able to cause small variations in\
    \ the\n   use of the network or the available resources (perhaps by modifying\n\
    \   the environment of a fiber) and so trigger the routing protocol to\n   make\
    \ new flooding announcements.  This situation is explicitly\n   mitigated in the\
    \ requirements for the routing protocol extensions\n   where it is noted that\
    \ the protocol must include damping and\n   configurable thresholds as already\
    \ exist in the core GMPLS routing\n   protocols.\n"

  - "7.  Manageability Considerations\n   GMPLS systems already contain a number of\
    \ management tools:\n   o  MIB modules exist to model the control-plane protocols\
    \ and the\n      network elements [RFC4802] [RFC4803], and there is early work\
    \ to\n      provide similar access through YANG.  The features described in\n\
    \      these models are currently designed to represent fixed-label\n      technologies\
    \ such as optical networks using the fixed grid;\n      extensions may be needed\
    \ in order to represent bandwidth,\n      frequency slots, and effective frequency\
    \ slots in flexi-grid\n      networks.\n   o  There are protocol extensions within\
    \ GMPLS signaling to allow\n      control-plane systems to report the presence\
    \ of faults that affect\n      LSPs [RFC4783], although it must be carefully noted\
    \ that these\n      mechanisms do not constitute an alarm mechanism that could\
    \ be used\n      to rapidly propagate information about faults in a way that would\n\
    \      allow the data plane to perform protection switching.  These\n      mechanisms\
    \ could easily be enhanced with the addition of\n      technology-specific reason\
    \ codes if any are needed.\n   o  The GMPLS protocols, themselves, already include\
    \ fault detection\n      and recovery mechanisms (such as the PathErr and Notify\
    \ messages\n      in RSVP-TE signaling as used by GMPLS [RFC3473]).  It is not\n\
    \      anticipated that these mechanisms will need enhancement to support\n  \
    \    flexi-grid, although additional reason codes may be needed to\n      describe\
    \ technology-specific error cases.\n   o  [RFC7260] describes a framework for\
    \ the control and configuration\n      of data-plane Operations, Administration,\
    \ and Maintenance (OAM).\n      It would not be appropriate for the IETF to define\
    \ or describe\n      data-plane OAM for optical systems, but the framework described\
    \ in\n      RFC 7260 could be used (with minor protocol extensions) to enable\n\
    \      data-plane OAM that has been defined by the originators of the\n      flexi-grid\
    \ data-plane technology (the ITU-T).\n   o  The Link Management Protocol (LMP)\
    \ [RFC4204] is designed to allow\n      the two ends of a network link to coordinate\
    \ and confirm the\n      configuration and capabilities that they will apply to\
    \ the link.\n      LMP is particularly applicable to optical links, where the\n\
    \      characteristics of the network devices may considerably affect how\n  \
    \    the link is used and where misconfiguration or mis-fibering could\n     \
    \ make physical interoperability impossible.  LMP could easily be\n      extended\
    \ to collect and report information between the endpoints\n      of links in a\
    \ flexi-grid network.\n"
