  - "2.  The SNMP Network Management Framework\n   The SNMP Management Framework presently
    consists of five major\n   components:\n   o    An overall architecture, described
    in RFC 2271 [1].\n   o    Mechanisms for describing and naming objects and events
    for the\n        purpose of management. The first version of this Structure of\n
    \       Management Information (SMI) is called SMIv1 and described in\n        STD
    16, RFC 1155 [2], STD 16, RFC 1212 [3] and RFC 1215 [4]. The\n        second version,
    called SMIv2, is described in STD 58, RFC 2478\n        [5], RFC 2579 [6] and
    RFC 2580 [7].\n   o    Message protocols for transferring management information.
    The\n        first version of the SNMP message protocol is called SNMPv1 and\n
    \       described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [8]. A second version of the SNMP\n        message
    protocol, which is not an Internet standards track\n        protocol, is called
    SNMPv2c and described in RFC 1901 [9] and\n        RFC 1906 [10]. The third version
    of the message protocol is\n        called SNMPv3 and described in RFC 1906 [10],
    RFC 2272 [11] and\n        RFC 2274 [12].\n   o    Protocol operations for accessing
    management information. The\n        first set of protocol operations and associated
    PDU formats is\n        described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [8]. A second set of protocol\n
    \       operations and associated PDU formats is described in RFC 1905\n        [13].\n
    \  o    A set of fundamental applications described in RFC 2273 [14] and\n        the
    view-based access control mechanism described in RFC 2275\n        [15].\n   Managed
    objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed\n   the Management
    Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are\n   defined using the mechanisms
    defined in the SMI.\n   This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to
    the SMIv2. A\n   MIB conforming to the SMIv1 can be produced through the appropriate\n
    \  translations. The resulting translated MIB must be semantically\n   equivalent,
    except where objects or events are omitted because no\n   translation is possible
    (use of Counter64). Some machine readable\n   information in SMIv2 will be converted
    into textual descriptions in\n   SMIv1 during the translation process. However,
    this loss of machine\n   readable information is not considered to change the
    semantics of the\n   MIB.\n"

  - "3.  Overview\n   This document identifies a set of objects for monitoring the\n
    \  configuration and active characteristics of devices with HPR in IP\n   network
    capabilities.  HPR is an enhancement to the Advanced Peer-\n   to-Peer Network
    (APPN) architecture that provides fast data routing\n   and improved session reliability.
    \ APPN is the aspect of Systems\n   Network Architecture (SNA) that supports peer-to-peer
    networking.\n   APPN/HPR in IP Networks is a further enhancement to the APPN/HPR\n
    \  architecture, described in RFC 2353 [18].  It provides a method with\n   which
    APPN/HPR nodes can communicate in IP networks.\n   APPN management information
    is defined by the APPN MIB [19].  HPR\n   management information is defined by
    the HPR MIB, RFC 2238 [20].\n   Highlights of the management functions supported
    by the APPN/HPR in\n   IP Networks MIB module include the following:\n   o    A
    count of UDP packets sent with each type of APPN traffic on\n        HPR/IP links.\n
    \  o    Monitoring and setting configuration parameters for the mappings\n        between
    APPN traffic types on Type of Service (TOS) Precedence\n        settings in the
    IP header.  Note that the TOS Precedence\n        settings have been redefined
    in RFC 2474 [21] as the first three\n        bits of the differentiated services
    code point (DSCP).\n   This MIB module does not support:\n   o    Configuration
    of IP addresses used for APPN ports or link\n        stations.\n"
  - contents:
    - "3.1.  HPR/IP Values for Objects in the APPN MIB\n   Ports and link stations
      are the APPN device's interface to the data\n   link control (DLC), which provides
      the physical transport, or to\n   another protocol, such as IP.  The APPN MIB
      identifies ports and link\n   stations using IP as the transport with the following
      objects:\n   o    appnPortDlcType\n   o    appnLsDlcType\n   o    appnLsStatusDlcType\n
      \  These objects all have the syntax IANAifType, and the value 126,\n   defined
      as \"IP (for APPN HPR in IP networks)\" shall be returned when\n   they identify
      an HPR/IP port or link station.\n   The IP address used for the port or link
      station is returned in the\n   following objects:\n   o    appnPortDlcLocalAddr\n
      \  o    appnLsLocalAddr\n   o    appnLsRemoteAddr\n   o    appnLsStatusLocalAddr\n
      \  o    appnLsStatusRemoteAddr\n   These objects have the syntax DisplayableDlcAddress,
      defined in the\n   APPN MIB as a textual convention to represent the address
      as an octet\n   string of ASCII characters.\n   The following two objects return
      object identifiers that tie port and\n   link table entries in the APPN MIB
      to lower-layer MIB entries:\n   o    appnPortSpecific\n   o    appnLsSpecific\n
      \  Both objects should return a RowPointer to the ifEntry in the agent's\n   ifTable
      for the physical interface associated with the local IP\n   address for the
      port.  If the agent implements the IP-MIB (RFC 2011),\n   this association between
      the IP address and the physical interface\n   will be represented in the ipNetToMediaTable.\n"

  - contents:
    - "3.2.  APPN/HPR in IP Networks MIB Structure\n   The APPN/HPR in IP Networks
      MIB module contains two groups of\n   objects:\n   o    hprIpMonitoringGroup
      - an object for counting outgoing HPR/IP\n        traffic for each APPN traffic
      type\n   o    hprIpConfigurationGroup - objects to represent TOS Precedence
      to\n        APPN traffic type mappings\n   These groups are described below
      in more detail.\n"

        of the hprIpActiveLsTable.\n   This table is indexed by the link station name
        and traffic type, and\n   contains a counter for the number of UDP packets
        sent on a link\n   station for that traffic type.\n"
      title: 3.2.1.  hprIpMonitoringGroup
    - contents:
      - "3.2.2.  hprIpConfigurationGroup\n   The hprIpMonitoringGroup group consists
        of the following objects and\n   tables:\n   1) hprIpAppnPortTable\n   This
        table supports reading and setting the default mapping between\n   APPN traffic
        types and TOS Precedence settings for all link stations\n   using a port.
        \ This mapping may be overridden for individual link\n   stations or individual
        connection networks.\n   2) hprIpLsTable\n   This table supports reading and
        setting the mappings between APPN\n   traffic types and TOS Precedence settings
        for an individual link\n   station and APPN traffic type.  If there is no
        entry in this table\n   for a given link station and traffic type, then that
        link station\n   inherits its mapping from its port.\n   3) hprIpCnTable\n
        \  This table supports reading and setting the mapping between APPN\n   traffic
        types and TOS Precedence settings for an individual\n   connection network
        and traffic type.  If there is no entry in this\n   table for a given connection
        network and traffic type, then that\n   connection network inherits its mapping

  - "5.  Security Considerations\n   Certain management information defined in this
    MIB may be considered\n   sensitive in some network environments.  Therefore,
    authentication of\n   received SNMP requests and controlled access to management\n
    \  information SHOULD be employed in such environments.  An\n   authentication
    protocol is defined in [12].  A protocol for access\n   control is defined in
    [15].  It is a customer responsibility to\n   properly set up access control for
    MIB access.\n   None of the read-only objects in this MIB reports a password,
    user\n   data, or anything else that is particularly sensitive.  Some\n   enterprises
    view their network configuration itself, as well as\n   information about network
    usage and performance, as corporate assets;\n   such enterprises may wish to restrict
    SNMP access to most of the\n   objects in the MIB.\n   The one read-write and
    four read-create objects in the MIB can affect\n   network operations; it is recommended
    that SNMP access to these\n   objects be restricted.  The five objects are:\n
    \  o    hprIpPortTOSPrecedence:  Setting this object immediately changes\n        the
    mapping for all link stations using this port which do not\n        have an entry
    to override the port value.  Improper mappings may\n        cause delays or disruptions
    in the network.  For example, if\n        APPN traffic type 'High' is mapped to
    IP TOS Precedence bits '\n        001', network control traffic will have the
    same TOS precedence\n        as bulk data traffic.  This may cause delays with
    session\n        initializations, and timeouts on control sessions that could\n
    \       cause network outages.\n   o    hprIpLsTOSPrecedence:  Setting this object
    has the potential for\n        delay or disruption for this link station as described
    above\n        with hprIpPortTOSPrecedence.\n   o    hprIpLsRowStatus:  Setting
    this object to delete(6) causes this\n        link station to revert to the default
    TOS Precedence mapping for\n        its port.  The customized mapping for this
    link station will no\n        longer be in effect.\n   o    hprIpCnTOSPrecedence:
    \ Setting this object has the potential for\n        delay or disruption for this
    links created for this connection\n        network as described above with hprIpPortTOSPrecedence.\n
    \  o    hprIpCnRowStatus:  Setting this object to delete(6) causes links\n        created
    for this connection network to revert to the default TOS\n        Precedence mapping
    for its port.  The customized mapping for\n        this connection network will
    no longer be in effect.\n"
