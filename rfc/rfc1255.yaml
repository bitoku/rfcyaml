- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   Computer networks form the infrastructure between the users\
    \ they\n   interconnect, and networks are built on an underlying naming and\n\
    \   numbering infrastructure, usually in the form of names and addresses.\n  \
    \ For example, some authority must exist to assign network addresses to\n   ensure\
    \ that numbering collisions do not occur.  This is of paramount\n   importance\
    \ for an environment which consists of multiple service\n   providers.\n"
- title: 2.  Approach
  contents:
  - "2.  Approach\n   It should be observed that there are several different naming\n\
    \   universes that could be used in the Directory Information Tree (DIT).\n  \
    \ For example, geographical naming, community naming, political naming,\n   organizational\
    \ naming, and so on.  The choice of naming universe\n   largely determines the\
    \ difficulty in mapping a user's query into a\n   series of Directory operations\
    \ to find useful information.  Although\n   it is possible to simultaneously support\
    \ multiple naming universes\n   with the DIT, this is likely to be unnatural.\
    \  As such, this scheme\n   focuses on a single naming universe.\n   The naming\
    \ universe in this scheme is based on civil authority.  That\n   is, it uses the\
    \ existing civil naming infrastructure and suggests a\n   (nearly) straight-forward\
    \ mapping on the DIT.  An important\n   characteristic is that entries can be\
    \ listed wherever searches for\n   them are likely to occur.  This implies that\
    \ a single object may be\n   listed as several separate entries.\n"
- title: 2.1.  Names and User-Friendliness
  contents:
  - "2.1.  Names and User-Friendliness\n   It must be emphasized that there are two\
    \ distinct concepts which are\n   often confused when discussing a naming scheme:\n\
    \           (1)   user-friendly naming:\n                 a property of a Directory\
    \ which allows users to easily\n                 identity objects of interest;\
    \ and,\n           (2)   Distinguished Name:\n                 the administratively\
    \ assigned name for an entry in the\n                 OSI Directory.\n   It must\
    \ be emphasized that Distinguished Names are not necessarily\n   user-friendly\
    \ names, and further, that user-friendly naming in the\n   Directory is a property\
    \ of the Directory Service, not of\n   Distinguished Names.\n"
- title: 2.2.  Choice of RDN Names
  contents:
  - "2.2.  Choice of RDN Names\n   The key aspect to appreciate for choice of RDNs\
    \ is that they should\n   provide a large name space to avoid collisions: the\
    \ naming strategy\n   must provide enough \"real estate\" to accommodate a large\
    \ demand for\n   Distinguished Names.  This is the primary requirement for RDNs.\
    \  A\n   secondary requirement is that RDNs should be meaningful (friendly to\n\
    \   people) and should not impede searching.\n   However, it is important to understand\
    \ that this second requirement\n   can be achieved by using additional (non- distinguished)\
    \ attribute\n   values.  For example, if the RDN of an entry is\n      organizationName\
    \ is Performance Systems International\n   then it is perfectly acceptable (and\
    \ indeed desirable) to have other\n   values for the \"organizationName\" attribute,\
    \ e.g.,\n      organizationName is PSI\n   The use of these abbreviated names\
    \ greatly aids searching whilst\n   avoiding unnecessary Distinguished Name conflicts.\n\
    \   In order to appreciate the naming scheme which follows, it is\n   important\
    \ to understand that wherever possible it leverages existing\n   naming infrastructure.\
    \  That is, it relies heavily on non-OSI naming\n   authorities which already\
    \ exist.  Note that inasmuch as it relies on\n   existing naming authorities,\
    \ there is little chance that any \"final\"\n   national decision could obsolete\
    \ this scheme.  (Any naming scheme may\n   be subject to the jurisdiction of certain\
    \ national agencies.  For\n   example, the US State Department is concerned with\
    \ any impact on US\n   telecommunications treaty obligations.) To do so would\
    \ require a\n   national decision that disregards existing national and regional\n\
    \   infrastructure, and establishes some entirely new and different\n   national\
    \ naming infrastructure.\n"
- title: 2.3.  Outline of the Scheme
  contents:
  - "2.3.  Outline of the Scheme\n   The naming scheme is divided into four parts:\n\
    \           (1)   a discussion of the right-to-use, registration, and\n      \
    \           publication concepts;\n           (2)   a discussion of objects with\
    \ national, regional, local,\n                 and foreign standing;\n       \
    \    (3)   a discussion of objects which may be listed at\n                 national,\
    \ regional, and local levels; and,\n           (4)   a discussion of how RDNs\
    \ are formed for listing entries\n                 at each different level.\n"
- title: 3.  The Naming Process
  contents:
  - "3.  The Naming Process\n   There are three stages to the naming process.\n"
- title: 3.1.  Right-To-Use
  contents:
  - "3.1.  Right-To-Use\n   First, a naming authority must establish the right-to-use\
    \ for any\n   name to be used, within the jurisdiction of the given naming\n \
    \  authority.  Names that are used in public are generally constrained\n   by\
    \ public laws.  Names that are only used in private are a private\n   matter.\
    \  We are primarily concerned here with public names because\n   these are the\
    \ names that are most interesting to enter into public\n   directories where we\
    \ can search for them.\n   There is a global governmental/civil/organizational\
    \ infrastructure\n   already in place to name and number things like people, cars,\
    \ houses,\n   buildings and streets; localities like populated places, cities,\n\
    \   counties, states, and countries; organizations like businesses,\n   schools,\
    \ and governments; and other entities like computers,\n   printers, ports, routers,\
    \ processes, files, filesystems, networks,\n   management domains, and so on.\
    \  There are also naming (and numbering)\n   authorities for various standards\
    \ and for networks (e.g., ISO/IEC,\n   CCITT, IANA) which depend on acceptance\
    \ by their constituent\n   communities for their authority.\n   This collective\
    \ infrastructure is comprised of a very large number of\n   authorities that we\
    \ will call naming authorities.  Naming authorities\n   tend toward hierarchical\
    \ organization.  Parents have authority\n   (granted by government) to choose\
    \ the names of new-born children, the\n   courts have authority to change a person's\
    \ name, car makers have\n   authority to name the models of cars they build (within\
    \ the limits of\n   trademarking law), and they are obligated to assign unique\
    \ serial\n   numbers to each car.  Cities assign names to their streets and\n\
    \   districts, states assign city, county, and township names, and so on.\n  \
    \ State governments also assign names to \"registered\" organizations\n   that\
    \ operate under state charters, which in turn name their own\n   suborganizations.\
    \  Cities and Counties license businesses to use\n   their chosen (unambiguous)\
    \ names \"in association with\" the city and\n   county names.  Companies name\
    \ and number the computers and\n   communications devices they make and sell.\
    \  There are many many name\n   spaces, some of which are subordinate to others,\
    \ and some of which\n   are independent.\n   Public names must be \"registered\"\
    \ in some \"public record\" to record\n   the fact of the assignment of the right-to-use\
    \ to specific \"owners.\"\n   In general, this is to prevent collisions of the\
    \ right-to-use\n   assignments in public shared name spaces.  For example, unique\
    \ names\n   given to corporations are registered by the state of incorporation.\n\
    \   A request to use a new name for any corporation must not conflict\n   with\
    \ the name of any other corporation registered in the same state.\n   The same\
    \ applies for businesses licensed within cities and counties.\n   Establishment\
    \ of the right-to-use for a name is not a Directory\n   Service.  The right-to-use\
    \ for a name is always derived from some\n   other (non-directory) source of authority\
    \ because of the legal\n   aspects of intellectual property rights which are entirely\
    \ outside\n   the scope of directory service specifications.  People and\n   organizations\
    \ attach great value to the names they are allowed to\n   associate with their\
    \ lives and businesses, and intellectual property\n   law protects their interests\
    \ with respect to these values.\n   This is not to say that directory service\
    \ designers and providers\n   have no interest in the processes and procedures\
    \ for establishment of\n   the right-to-use for the names that will be entered\
    \ into any\n   directory.  Indeed, without a supply of rightfully-usable names,\n\
    \   there cannot be any directory.  But, given an adequate supply of\n   registered\
    \ names, the directory service is not otherwise concerned.\n   We should note\
    \ here that some naming authorities must deal with name\n   spaces that are shared\
    \ among large communities (such as computer\n   networks) in which collisions\
    \ will occur among applicants for desired\n   name assignments, while other name\
    \ spaces (such as for given names of\n   children in a family) are not shared\
    \ outside the family.  Sharing is\n   always a problem, which has led to trademarking\
    \ laws, business\n   license laws, and so on.  Naming within organizations should\
    \ be\n   easier, because it is \"in the family,\" so to speak.  Hierarchical\n\
    \   naming schemes facilitate distribution of naming authority.\n"
- title: 3.2.  Registration
  contents:
  - "3.2.  Registration\n   Second, a name may be bound (as a value) to some object\
    \ attribute.\n   Given the right to use a name, a Naming Authority, such as a\
    \ family\n   which has an inherited surname and, more or less, has the right to\n\
    \   use any names it pleases for its children's given names, must bind\n   selected\
    \ names to selected object attributes (e.g., firstname=Einar).\n   Note that this\
    \ same name might also be used as the first name or\n   middle name of other children,\
    \ as long as each sequence of given\n   names of each family member is distinguished\
    \ (i.e., none are\n   duplicates) within the family.  Wise families do not bind\
    \ the same\n   sequence of given names to more than one child.  Some avoid any\n\
    \   multiple use of a single name.  Some use generational qualifiers to\n   prevent\
    \ parent-child conflicts.\n   The Internet Domain Name System (DNS) names top\
    \ level domains which\n   are then free (within some technical limits) to chose\
    \ and bind names\n   to entries which are subordinate to a given named domain,\
    \ and so\n   forth down the DNS name tree.  The ISO/CCITT naming system serves\
    \ the\n   same purposes in other separate name spaces.\n"
- title: 3.3.  Publication
  contents:
  - "3.3.  Publication\n   Third, after binding, a name must be advertised or published\
    \ in some\n   community if it is to be referenced by others.  If it is not\n \
    \  advertised or published, then no one can refer to it.\n   This publication\
    \ stage is what the Directory Service is all about.\n   The Directory contains\
    \ entries for \"listed\" names (or numbers) that\n   are bound to the attributes\
    \ of the entries in the directory DIT.\n   Historically speaking, the directory\
    \ business is a subclass of the\n   publishing business, serving to dereference\
    \ names into knowledge\n   about what they stand for.\n   It is important to keep\
    \ in mind that a directory \"listing entry\" is\n   not a \"registration\" unless\
    \ a particular segment of the directory\n   also just happens to be the authoritative\
    \ master register of some\n   naming authority.  Registration and listing are\
    \ very different\n   service functions, though it is conceivable that they might\
    \ be\n   combined in a single DIT.\n   For example, in the United States of America,\
    \ each state name is\n   registered by the Congress by inclusion of the name in\
    \ the\n   legislation that \"admits each State into the Union.\" Note however\n\
    \   that the name is also then published in many places (such as on maps\n   and\
    \ in directories), while the master \"register\" is kept with the\n   other original\
    \ records of laws enacted by the Congress and signed by\n   the President.  Also,\
    \ the name is then entered (listed) in many\n   directories, in association with\
    \ the name \"The United States of\n   America.\" And so on down the civil naming\
    \ tree, with entities named\n   in each state, etc.  It is certainly not the case\
    \ that the American\n   National Standards Institute (ANSI) registers the names\
    \ of the States\n   in the United States of America!  That right and duty is clearly\n\
    \   reserved to the Government of the United States of America.\n   On the other\
    \ hand, in the Internet DNS, the act of inserting a given\n   rightfully-usable\
    \ name and address entry into a nameserver\n   constitutes simultaneous registration\
    \ and directory publication.\n"

- title: 5.1.1.  Kinds of Organizations
  contents:
  - "5.1.1.  Kinds of Organizations\n   An organization is said to have national-standing\
    \ if it is chartered\n   (created and named) by the US Congress. An example of\
    \ such an\n   organization might be a national laboratory.  There is no other\n\
    \   entity which is empowered by government to confer national-standing\n   on\
    \ organizations.  However, ANSI maintains an alphanumeric nameform\n   registration\
    \ for organizations, and this will be used as the public\n   directory service\
    \ basis for conferring national-standing on private\n   organizations.\n   An\
    \ organization is said to have regional-standing if it is chartered\n   by the\
    \ government of that region.  An example of such an organization\n   might be\
    \ a public university.  In addition, private organizations may\n   achieve regional-standing\
    \ by registering with the \"Secretary of\n   State\" (or similar entity) within\
    \ that region -- this is termed a\n   \"doing business as\" (DBA) registration.\n\
    \                                   NOTE:\n         An organization may have a\
    \ DBA registration in several states,\n         even though it is incorporated\
    \ in only one state.  Where an\n         organization registers itself is largely\
    \ dependent on where it\n         might choose to incorporate, and where it might\
    \ choose to\n         locate (and license) its business operations.\n        \
    \ For example, a large organization might have a DBA registration\n         in\
    \ most of the 50 states, and be incorporated in Delaware.  For\n         the purposes\
    \ of this naming scheme, such an organization is\n         said to have regional-standing\
    \ in each state where it has a DBA\n         registration.  This DBA registration\
    \ confers the sole right to\n         use the DBA name in association with the\
    \ named jurisdiction of\n         the registration authority.\n   An organization\
    \ is said to have local-standing if it is chartered by\n   a local government\
    \ within that place.  In addition, private\n   organizations may achieve local-standing\
    \ by registering with a\n   \"County Clerk\" (or similar entity) within that place\
    \ -- this is\n   termed a \"doing business as\" (DBA) registration.  Note that\
    \ local-\n   standing is somewhat ambiguous in that there may be multiple local\n\
    \   governments contained within a county or county-equivalent.\n   Depending\
    \ on local government rules of incorporation and containment,\n   registering\
    \ with one entity may prevent others from registering that\n   same name with\
    \ other entities contained within that place.  In order\n   to avoid ambiguity,\
    \ other distinguishing attributes, such as\n   \"streetAddress\", may be needed\
    \ to provide uniqueness.\n"
- title: 5.1.2.  Modeling Organizations
  contents:
  - "5.1.2.  Modeling Organizations\n   In the DIT, an organization is modeled with\
    \ an object of\n   class \"organization\".  In addition, some combination of the\n\
    \   following auxiliary object classes might also be used:\n           (1)   if\
    \ an organization has national-standing derived from\n                 ANSI registration,\
    \ then this is modeled by including in\n                 the entry an object class\
    \ attribute value of\n                 \"ansiOrgObject\", which is defined thusly:\n\
    \                   ansiOrgObject OBJECT-CLASS\n                       SUBCLASS\
    \ OF top\n                       MUST CONTAIN { ansiOrgNumericCode }\n       \
    \    (2)   if an organization has national-standing (either in the\n         \
    \        US or some other nation), then it may be necessary to\n             \
    \    identify the country which corresponds to the registry\n                \
    \ which names the organization.  This is modeled by\n                 including\
    \ in the entry an object class attribute value\n                 of \"nationalObject\"\
    , which is defined thusly:\n                   nationalObject OBJECT-CLASS\n \
    \                      SUBCLASS OF top\n                       MUST CONTAIN {\
    \ countryName }\n           (3)   if an organization has local-standing, then\
    \ it may be\n                 necessary to identify the place in US FIPS 55 which\n\
    \                 corresponds to the registry which names the\n              \
    \   organization.  This is modeled by including in the\n                 entry\
    \ an object class attribute value of\n                 \"fips55Object\", which\

    \              SUBCLASS OF top\n                       MUST CONTAIN { fipsPlaceNumericCode\

    \ that an organizational\n   person be modeled with an object of class \"organizationalPerson\"\
    .\n   Outside of organizations, persons exist only in a residential context.\n\
    \   As such they always have local standing.  For a given person, it\n   should\
    \ always be possible to identify the place in US FIPS 55 which\n   corresponds\
    \ to the \"smallest\" populated place where any person\n   resides, and then use\
    \ the code associated with that place to aid in\n   distinguishing the person.\
    \  A residential person is modeled with an\n   object of class \"residentialPerson\"\
    .  In addition, since it may be\n   necessary to identify the place in US FIPS\
    \ 55 which corresponds\n   to where the person resides, an object class attribute\

  - "6.2.  Persons\n   Listing organizational persons is a local matter to be decided\
    \ by\n   each organization.\n   Residential persons are identified by the place\
    \ where they reside,\n   usually with a multi-valued RDN consisting of a \"commonName\"\
    \n   attribute value, and some other distinguished attribute value.\n   Although\
    \ an obvious choice is to use something like \"postalCode\" or\n   \"streetAddress\"\
    , it should be noted that this information may be\n   considered private.  Hence,\
    \ some other, distinguishing attribute\n   value may be used -- possibly even\
    \ a \"serial number\" attribute value\n   which has no other purpose other than\
    \ to give uniqueness.  (It should\n   be noted that an attribute of this kind\
    \ is not helpful in regards to\n   searching -- other attribute values containing\
    \ meaningful information\n   should be added to the entry and made available for\

- title: 'Appendix A: Revision History of this Scheme'
  contents:
  - "Appendix A: Revision History of this Scheme\n   The first version of this scheme\
    \ (NADF-71) was contributed to the\n   North American Directory Forum at its November\
    \ 27-30, 1990 meeting.\n   The (mis)features were:\n           (1)   Because of\
    \ the lack of confidence in ANSI registration\n                 procedures, it\
    \ was proposed that the US trademarks be\n                 used as the basis for\
    \ RDNs of organizations with\n                 national-standing.\n          \
    \       This proved unworkable since the same trademark may be\n             \
    \    issued to different organizations in different\n                 industries.\n\
    \           (2)   There was no pre-existing registry used for populated\n    \
    \             places.\n                 This proved unworkable since the effort\
    \ to define a new\n                 registry is problematic.\n   The second version\
    \ of this scheme was contributed to the ANSI\n   Registration Authority Committee\
    \ at its January 30, 1991 meeting, and\n   the IETF OSI Directory Services Working\
    \ Group at its February 12-13,\n   1991 meeting.  The (mis)features were:\n  \
    \         (1)   The ANSI numeric name form registry was used as the\n        \
    \         basis for RDNs of organizations with national\n                 standings.\n\
    \           (2)   The FIPS 5 state numeric code was used as the basis for\n  \
    \               RDNs of states and state-equivalents.\n           (3)   The FIPS\
    \ 55 place numeric code was used as the basis\n                 for RDNs of populated\
    \ places.\n   The choice of numeric rather than alphanumeric name forms was\n\
    \   unpopular, but was motivated by the desire to avoid using the ANSI\n   alphanumeric\
    \ name form registry, which was perceived as unstable.\n   The third version of\
    \ this scheme was contributed to US State\n   Department Study Group D's MHS-MD\
    \ subcommittee at its March 7-8 1991\n   meeting.  That version used alphanumeric\
    \ name forms for all objects,\n   under the perception that the ANSI alphanumeric\
    \ name form registry\n   will prove stable.  If the ANSI alphanumeric name form\
    \ registry\n   proves unstable, then two alternatives are possible:\n        \
    \   (1)   disallow organizations with national-standing in the US\n          \
    \       portion of the DIT; or,\n           (2)   use the ANSI numeric name form\
    \ registry instead.\n   Hopefully neither of these two undesirable alternatives\
    \ will prove\n   necessary.\n   The fourth version of this scheme (NADF-103) was\
    \ contributed to the\n   NADF at its March 18-22, 1991 meeting.  This version\
    \ introduced the\n   notion of organizations with regional standing being listed\
    \ at the\n   national level through the use of alias names and multi-valued RDNs.\n\
    \   The fifth version of this scheme (NADF-123) was produced at the NADF\n   meeting\
    \ (and also published in the Internet community as RFC1212).\n   This version\
    \ generalized the listing concept by introducing the\n   notion of optimized civil\
    \ naming.  Further, the document was edited\n   to clearly note the different\
    \ naming sub-structures and the relation\n   between them.\n   The sixth version\
    \ of this scheme (NADF-143) was contributed to the\n   NADF before its July 9-12,\
    \ 1991 meeting, and was edited to reflect\n   comments received from the Internet\
    \ and other communities.  The\n   changes were:\n           (1)   The schema definitions\
    \ were removed from Appendix A and\n                 placed in a separate document,\
    \ NADF-132.  In NADF-132:\n                 the prefix object-identifier was changed\
    \ (the original\n                 assignment was in error); and, the definition\
    \ of a\n                 \"nadfADDMD\" object was considerably expanded.\n   \
    \        (2)   States and state-equivalents are now named using\n            \
    \     attribute values of \"stateOrProvinceName\".\n           (3)   Populated\
    \ places now correspond to counties, though\n                 FIPS 55 is still\
    \ used extensively.\n           (4)   The text of this document was reworked to\
    \ more clearly\n                 distinguish between registration and listing.\n\
    \           (5)   The \"foreignOrganization\" and \"fips55Object\" object\n  \
    \               classes were added.\n          The seventh version of this scheme\
    \ (NADF-166) was produced at\n          the NADF meeting.  It made a few changes:\n\
    \           (1)   It was noted that organizations with local standing may\n  \
    \               need additional distinguishing attributes when listing.\n    \
    \       (2)   The \"usOrganization\" object class was removed and\n          \
    \       replaced with the auxiliary object class\n                 \"ansiOrgObject\"\
    .\n           (3)   The \"foreignOrganization\" object class was removed and\n\
    \                 replaced with the auxiliary object class\n                 \"\
    nationalObject\".  This may be used when listing any\n                 organization\
    \ of national standing (regardless of\n                 whether that organization\
    \ is US-based).  For example,\n                 an organization with US national-standing\
    \ would need\n                 this when being listed at the regional or local\
    \ level.\n           (4)   Figures corresponding to the DIT structures were added,\n\
    \                 along with some minor additional text in the usage\n       \
    \          examples.\n           (5)   The Acknowledgements section, long out\
    \ of date, was\n                 removed.\n          The eighth (current) version\
    \ of this scheme was produced after\n          the NADF meeting.  It corrects\
    \ a few typographical errors.\n"
