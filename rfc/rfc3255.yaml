  - "1. Introduction\n   Current implementations of PPP over SONET/SDH are required\
    \ to select\n   transport structures from the relatively limited number of\n \
    \  contiguously concatenated signals that are available.\n   The only currently\
    \ supported SONET/SDH SPE/VCs in RFC 2615 [3] are\n   the following:\n       \
    \   SONET                   SDH\n      ----------------------------------------\n\

    \   at present.\n   The use of virtual concatenation means that the right size\
    \ SONET/SDH\n   bandwidth can be selected for PPP links.\n   For the convenience\
    \ of the reader, the equivalent terms are listed\n   below:\n          SONET \

- title: 3. Physical Layer Requirements
  contents:
  - "3. Physical Layer Requirements\n   There are two minor modifications to the physical\
    \ layer requirements\n   as defined in RFC 2615 when virtually concatenated SPEs/VCs\
    \ are used\n   to provide transport for PPP over SONET/SDH.\n   First, the path\
    \ signal label (C2 byte) value for SONET/SDH STS-1/VC-3\n   and above SPE/VCs\
    \ is required to be the same for all constituent\n   channels.  This is in contrast\
    \ to the use of a single C2 byte for PPP\n   transport over contiguously concatenated\
    \ SONET/SDH SPE/VCs.  The\n   values used for the C2 bytes should be in accordance\
    \ with RFC 2615.\n   For SONET VT-1.5/2/6 and SDH VC-11/12/2 the path signal label\
    \ (V5\n   byte bits 5-7) is required to be the same for all constituent\n   channels\
    \ per ITU-T G.707 [7] and ANSI T1.105.02 [6].\n   Second, for SONET/SDH STS-1/VC-3\
    \ and above SPE/VCs the multi-frame\n   indicator (H4) byte will be unused for\
    \ transport links utilizing\n   contiguously concatenated SONET/SDH SPE/VCs. \
    \ When the concatenation\n   scheme is virtual as opposed to contiguous, the H4\
    \ byte must be\n   populated as per ITU-T G.707 or T1.105.02.  Similarly, for\
    \ virtual\n   concatenation based on SONET VT-1.5/2/6 and SDH VC-11/12/2 channels\n\
    \   bit 2 of the path overhead K4 byte will be set to the value indicated\n  \
    \ per ITU-T G.707 [7] and ANSI T1.105.02 [6].\n"
