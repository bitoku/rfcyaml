  - "3. UNINETT - a brief overview\n   UNINETT is a Limited Company (AS) operating\
    \ the Norwegian network for\n   academics and research. It is incorporated under\
    \ Norwegian law, and\n   it's company number is 968100211.\n   More information\
    \ is available from the UNINETT web server at:\n   http://www.uninett.no/\n"
- title: 4. PCA Scope
  contents:
  - "4. PCA Scope\n   The scope of the UNINETT PCA is determined by UNINETT Policy.\
    \ It will\n   chiefly certify CAs to run on behalf of legal entities such as\n\
    \   schools and companies.\n"
- title: 4.1 The certification tree
  contents:
  - "4.1 The certification tree\n   The certification tree beneath the UNINETT PCA\
    \ comprise three\n   distinct entities: Certification Authorities (CAs), Registration\n\
    \   Authorities (RAs) and users. CAs are described in the PEM documents\n   [1,2,3,4].\
    \ An explanation of RAs is given bellow.\n   There will be one CA, with possible\
    \ sublevel CAs, per UNINETT member\n   organization. The CA may be run by the\
    \ organization itself, or by the\n   organization running the PCA for organizations\
    \ who do not want to\n   take on the responsibility themselves.\n"
- title: 4.2 Use of Registration Authorities (RAs)
  contents:
  - "4.2 Use of Registration Authorities (RAs)\n   Since the CA may be located far\
    \ away from the users, local\n   authorities are needed for physical identification/authentication\
    \ of\n   users. For security reasons, and to avoid an unnecessary large number\n\
    \   of CAs, these authorities are not allowed to issue certificates.\n   A registration\
    \ authority (RA) is an ordinary user, appointed by an\n   organization or an organizational\
    \ unit and trusted by a CA, serving\n   as a point of contact for persons who\
    \ want to register as users, i.e.\n   to have a certificate issued. In order to\
    \ avoid faked requests for\n   certification, users must send their self-signed\
    \ certificate to an\n   appropriate RA, and then physically visit the RA with\
    \ proof of\n   identity. The RA will forward the self-signed certificate to the\
    \ CA\n   in a message signed by the RA, if the user is properly authenticated.\n\
    \   For bulk certification (see 5.3) the RA must physically verify the\n   identity\
    \ of the user before giving out the password for access to the\n   users private\
    \ key.\n   A CA may appoint as many RAs as it wish. The only difference between\n\
    \   certifying an RA and an ordinary user is that the RA (a person) must\n   sign\
    \ an agreement with the certifying CA, stating the obligation to\n   adhere to\
    \ the agreed procedures.\n"

    \ key stored on a smartcard.\n   - The PCA will be run on a dedicated workstation\
    \ with no network\n     connection. The workstation will be physically secured.\n\
    \   - Exchanging data between the PCA workstation and the rest of the\n     world\
    \ will be done by using tapes or floppy discs.\n   - The PCA RSA key pair will\
    \ have a length of 1024 bits.\n   - Backups from the PCA workstation must be stored\
    \ in at least one off\n     site location. Backups must be physically secured\n"

    \ keys (and certificates) on behalf of\n   users, all information pertaining the\
    \ users private key will be\n   securely deleted after it has been received by\
    \ the user.  CAs will\n   always generate their own key pairs, thus no security\
    \ relevant\n   information will be collected by the PCA.\n   All archived material\
    \ concerning DNs for users will be stored on the\n   CA workstations, which are\

  contents:
  - "6.1 Policy and procedures when certifying CAs\n   In order to be certified, a\
    \ CA must sign an agreement with the\n   UNINETT PCA stating the obligation to\
    \ adhere to the agreed\n   procedures.\n   The persons responsible for running\
    \ the CA will be evaluated by the\n   UNINETT PCA, in order to determine whether\
    \ they exhibit the necessary\n   qualifications and have access to the resources\
    \ needed in order to\n   run the CA securely.\n   The CA must submit its self\
    \ signed certificate to the UNINETT PCA.\n"
- title: 6.2 Policy and procedures when certifying RAs
  contents:
  - "6.2 Policy and procedures when certifying RAs\n   The organization or organizational\
    \ unit is responsible for appointing\n   RA persons, typically 1-3 persons per\
    \ organization/unit. The person\n   representing the RA must sign an agreement\
    \ with the certifying CA,\n   stating the obligation to adhere to the agreed procedures\
    \ in order to\n   be certified.\n   The person representing the RA will be evaluated\
    \ by the certifying\n   CA, in order to determine whether he/she exhibits the\
    \ necessary\n   qualifications and has access to the resources needed to run the\
    \ RA\n   securely.\n   The RA must submit its self signed certificate to the certifying\
    \ CA.\n   In the absence of RAs, or equivalent, the validity of the\n   certification\
    \ request (i.e. the identity of the requestor) must be\n   verified by \"out of\
    \ band\" means. These means will vary from case to\n   case, depending on physical\
    \ distance, prior knowledge etc.\n"
- title: 6.3 Policy and procedures when certifying users
  contents:
  - "6.3 Policy and procedures when certifying users\n   There are two ways in which\
    \ a user can be certified:\n   - individual certification, or\n   - bulk certification\n\
    \   When applying individual certification, a user will generate his own\n   key\
    \ pair, and his own self-signed certificate. The certification\n   procedure follows\
    \ the PEM documents [1,2,3,4], with the exception\n   that the certification request\
    \ will be sent to an RA. The user must\n   then visit the RA with proof of identity\n\
    \   Bulk certification of users will typically be done when it is\n   desirable\
    \ to certify many users belonging to the same organization.\n   An example could\
    \ be the certification of students at the beginning of\n   a semester, or initial\
    \ certification of all employees belonging to a\n   company. When bulk certifying\
    \ users, the CA will generate the users'\n   key pairs and certificates. A user's\
    \ key pair together with the\n   certificate will be DES-encrypted and sent electronically\
    \ to the\n   user.  The pass phrase to generate the DES-key can be collected at\n\
    \   the local RA, given proof of identity. The pass phrase can also be\n   sent\
    \ by certified surface mail.\n   When bulk certifying users the CA or RA shall\
    \ not access or store any\n   of the users' private information.\n   A person's\
    \ identity is verified by:\n   - driver's licence\n   - passport\n   - bank card\
    \ (Norwegian)\n   CA and RA need not be separate entities. A CA may verify the\
    \ identity\n   of users directly, following the procedures described above.\n"
- title: 6.4 Validity interval for issued certificates
  contents:
  - "6.4 Validity interval for issued certificates\n   Validity interval for user\
    \ and RA certificates is maximum 2 years\n   from date of issue.\n   There is\
    \ in principle no special requirements regarding validity\n   intervals for CA\
    \ certificates, though it is recommended not to issue\n   certificates for more\
    \ than a 10 year period.\n"
- title: 6.5 The CAs right to a DN and procedures to resolve DN conflicts
  contents:
  - "6.5 The CAs right to a DN and procedures to resolve DN conflicts\n   CAs will\
    \ preferably use DNs reflecting the organizational scope under\n   which they\
    \ certify users (see also \"Naming conventions\"). The\n   certifying entity must\
    \ ensure, with the aid of X.500 as\n   disambiguation tool, the uniqueness of\
    \ a DN.\n"
- title: 6.6 The user's right to a DN and procedures to resolve DN conflicts
  contents:
  - "6.6 The user's right to a DN and procedures to resolve DN conflicts\n   It is\
    \ the certifying CA who will determine a user's DN and ensure,\n   with the aid\
    \ of X.500 as disambiguation tool, the uniqueness of a DN.\n   Users will preferably\
    \ use DNs reflecting the organization to which\n   they belong, and their full\
    \ name (see also \"Naming conventions\").\n"
- title: 7. Certificate management
  contents:
  - "7. Certificate management\n   UNINETTs X.500 service will be used when storing\
    \ certificates\n   belonging to users within UNINETT member organizations. Other\
    \ users\n   may also use the X.500 service if available. All certificates issued\n\
    \   will be maintained in a local database by the certifying entity in\n   addition\
    \ to the X.500 directory. If a CA does not have access to the\n   X.500 service,\
    \ all issued certificates must be mailed to the UNINETT\n   PCA who will make\
    \ the X.500 entries on behalf of the CA.\n   Certificates can be requested in\
    \ two ways, either directly from the\n   X.500 directory, or by querying a mail-responder\
    \ service maintained\n   by the UNINETT PCA.\n   Details on how certificates are\
    \ mailed, and how to use the mail-\n   responder service can be found at the following\
    \ WWW site:\n   http://www.uninett.no/pca/\n"
- title: 8. CRL Management
  contents:
  - "8. CRL Management\n   Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs) must be issued at least\
    \ once a\n   month, on a specified date, by CAs. The UNINETT X.500 service will\
    \ be\n   used to publish CRLs. If a CA does not have access to the X.500\n   service\
    \ the CRL must be mailed to the UNINETT PCA who will make the\n   X.500 entries\
    \ on behalf of the CA.\n   CRLs can be requested in two ways, either directly\
    \ from the X.500\n   directory, or by querying a mail-responder service maintained\
    \ by the\n   UNINETT PCA.\n   Details on how CRLs are mailed, and how to use the\
    \ mail-responder\n   service can be found at the following WWW site:\n   http://www.uninett.no/pca/\n\
    \   The UNINETT PCA will continually update the CRL with revoked CA\n   certificates.\n\
    \   There is no automatic distribution service of CRLs. Therefore users\n   will\
    \ have to pull CRLs from the X.500 or the mail-responder. Black\n   lists are\
    \ currently not supported. Appropriate news groups and\n   information services\
    \ will be used to announce the issuance of new\n   CRLs.\n"
- title: 9. Naming Conventions
  contents:
  - "9. Naming Conventions\n   Naming conventions for CAs:\n   CAs' DNs will follow\
    \ the conventions adopted by their organization.\n   Organizations who do not\
    \ have any preferences in this matter should\n   use the following scheme:\n \
    \  C=<country>, O=<organization> [, OU=<organizational-unit>]\n   Country is the\
    \ country code, e.g. all Norwegian organizations have\n   C=no. Organization is\
    \ the organization represented by the CA (e.g.\n   the scope for which the CA\
    \ certify users). Organizational-unit is\n   optional, reflecting a unit within\
    \ a large organization for cases in\n   which the organization has more than one\
    \ CA. Example: the CA\n   responsible for certifying UNINETT employees will be\
    \ assigned the\n   following DN: C=no, O=uninett\n   Naming conventions for users:\n\
    \   Users' DNs will follow the conventions adopted by their organization.\n  \
    \ Organizations who do not have any preferences in this matter should\n   use\
    \ the following scheme:\n   C=<country>, O=<organization>, [OU=<organizational-unit>,]\n\
    \   CN=<personal name>\n   Personal name will be a unique name for the user with\
    \ respect to the\n   organization to which the user belongs. An organization's\
    \ CA is\n   responsible for ensuring that all certified users have a distinct\n\
    \   personal name. Usually personal name will be the user's full name.\n   Use\
    \ of OU is optional. Example if Per Olsen is an employee of UNINETT\n   he will\
    \ be assigned the following DN: C=no, O=uninett, CN=Per Olsen.\n   The choice\
    \ of which users to certify as belonging to the organization\n   is made by the\
    \ CA, not by the PCA.\n"
