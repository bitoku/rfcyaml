  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   This document specifies a response set for describing the\
    \ reputation\n   of an email identifier.  A \"response set\" in this context is\
    \ defined\n   in [RFC7070] and is used to describe assertions a reputation service\n\
    \   provider can make about email identifiers as well as metadata that\n   can\
    \ be included in such a reply beyond the base set specified there.\n   An atomic\
    \ reputation response is called a \"reputon\", defined in\n   [RFC7071].  That\
    \ document also defines a media type to contain a\n   reputon for transport, and\
    \ creates a registry for reputation\n   applications and the interesting parameters\
    \ of each.\n"

    \ [MAIL].\n"
- title: 3.1.  Assertions
  contents:
  - "3.1.  Assertions\n   The \"email-id\" reputation application recognizes the following\n\
    \   assertions:\n   abusive:  The subject identifier is associated with sending\
    \ or\n      handling email of a personally abusive, threatening, or otherwise\n\
    \      harassing nature\n   fraud:  The subject identifier is associated with\
    \ the sending or\n      handling of fraudulent email, such as \"phishing\" (some\
    \ good\n      discussion on this topic can be found in [IODEF-PHISHING])\n   invalid-recipients:\
    \  The subject identifier is associated with\n      delivery attempts to nonexistent\
    \ recipients\n   malware:  The subject identifier is associated with the sending\
    \ or\n      handling of malware via email\n   spam:  The subject identifier is\
    \ associated with the sending or\n      handling of unwanted bulk email\n   For\
    \ all assertions, the \"rating\" scale is linear: a value of 0.0\n   means there\
    \ is no data to support the assertion, a value of 1.0 means\n   all accumulated\
    \ data support the assertion, and the intervening\n   values have a linear relationship\
    \ (i.e., a score of \"x\" is twice as\n   strong of an assertion as a value of\
    \ \"x/2\").\n"
- title: 3.2.  Response Set Extensions
  contents:
  - "3.2.  Response Set Extensions\n   The \"email-id\" reputation application recognizes\
    \ the following\n   OPTIONAL extensions to the basic response set defined in [RFC7071]:\n\
    \   email-id-identity:  A token indicating the source of the identifier;\n   \
    \   that is, where the subject identifier was found in the message.\n      This\
    \ MUST be one of:\n      dkim: The signing domain, i.e., the value of the \"d=\"\
    \ tag, found\n            on a valid DomainKeys Identified Mail [DKIM] signature\
    \ in\n            the message\n      ipv4: The IPv4 address of the client\n  \
    \    ipv6: The IPv6 address of the client\n      rfc5321.helo:  The RFC5321.HELO\
    \ value used by the client (see\n            [SMTP])\n      rfc5321.mailfrom:\
    \  The RFC5321.MailFrom value of the envelope of\n            the message (see\
    \ [SMTP])\n      rfc5322.from:  The RFC5322.From field of the message (see [MAIL])\n\
    \      spf:  The domain name portion of the identifier (RFC5321.MailFrom\n   \
    \         or RFC5321.HELO) verified by [SPF]\n   sources:  A token relating a\
    \ count of the number of sources of data\n      that contributed to the reported\
    \ reputation.  This is in contrast\n      to the \"sample-size\" parameter, which\
    \ indicates the total number\n      of reports across all reporting sources.\n\
    \   A reply that does not contain the \"identity\" or \"sources\" extensions\n\
    \   is making a non-specific statement about how the reputation returned\n   was\
    \ developed.  A client can use or ignore such a reply at its\n   discretion.\n"
- title: 3.3.  Identifiers
  contents:
  - "3.3.  Identifiers\n   In evaluating an email message on the basis of reputation,\
    \ there can\n   be more than one identifier in the message needing to be validated.\n\
    \   For example, a message may have different email addresses in the\n   RFC5321.MailFrom\
    \ parameter and the RFC5322.From header field.  The\n   RFC5321.Helo identifier\
    \ will obviously be different.  Consequently,\n   the software evaluating the\
    \ email message may need to query for the\n   reputation of more than one identifier.\n\
    \   The purpose of including the identity in the reply is to expose to\n   the\
    \ client the context in which the identifier was extracted from the\n   message\
    \ under evaluation.  In particular, several of the items listed\n   are extracted\
    \ verbatim from the message and have not been subjected\n   to any kind of validation,\
    \ while a domain name present in a valid\n   DKIM signature has some more reliable\
    \ semantics associated with it.\n   Computing or using reputation information\
    \ about unauthenticated\n   identifiers has substantially reduced value, but can\
    \ sometimes be\n   useful when combined.  For example, a reply that indicates\
    \ a message\n   contained one of these low-value identifiers with a high \"spam\"\
    \n   rating might not be worthy of notice, but a reply that indicates a\n   message\
    \ contained several of them could be grounds for suspicion.\n   A client interested\
    \ in checking these weaker identifiers would issue\n   a query about each of them\
    \ using the same assertion (e.g., \"spam\"),\n   and then collate the results\
    \ to determine which ones and how many of\n   them came back with ratings indicating\
    \ content of concern, and take\n   action accordingly.  For stronger identifiers,\
    \ decisions can\n   typically be made based on a few or even just one of them.\n"
- title: 3.4.  Query Extensions
  contents:
  - "3.4.  Query Extensions\n   A query within this application can include the OPTIONAL\
    \ query\n   parameter \"identity\" to indicate which specific identity is of\n\
    \   interest to the query.  Legal values are the same as those listed in\n   Section\
    \ 3.2.\n"
