- title: 2.  Background
  contents:
  - "2.  Background\n   The Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) established\
    \ a\n   requirement for discovering home proxies during SIP registration and\n\
    \   published this requirement in [6].  The 3GPP network dynamically\n   assigns\
    \ a home service proxy to each address-of-record (AOR).  This\n   assignment may\
    \ occur in conjunction with a REGISTER operation, or\n   out-of-band as needed\
    \ to support call services when the address-of-\n   record has no registrations.\
    \  This home service proxy may provide\n   both inbound (UA terminated) and outbound\
    \ (UA originated) services.\n   In the inbound case, the Request-Uniform Resource\
    \ Identifier (URI) of\n   incoming SIP requests matches the address-of-record\
    \ of a user\n   associated with the home service proxy.  The home service proxy\
    \ then\n   (in most cases) forwards the request to the registered contact\n  \
    \ address for that AOR.  A mechanism for traversing required proxies\n   between\
    \ the home service proxy and the registered UA is presented in\n   [4].\n   Outbound\
    \ (UA originated) session cases raise another issue.\n   Specifically, \"How does\
    \ the UA know which service proxy to use and\n   how to get there?\"\n   Several\
    \ mechanisms were proposed in list discussions, including:\n   1. Configuration\
    \ data in the UA.  This raises questions of UA\n      configuration management\
    \ and updating, especially if proxy\n      assignment is very dynamic, such as\
    \ in load-balancing scenarios.\n   2. Use of some other protocol, such as HTTP,\
    \ to get configuration\n      data from a configuration server in the home network.\
    \  While\n      functional, this solution requires additional protocol engines,\n\
    \      firewall complexity, operations overhead, and significant\n      additional\
    \ \"over the air\" traffic.\n   3. Use of lookup tables in the home network, as\
    \ may be done for\n      inbound requests in some 3G networks.  This has a relatively\
    \ high\n      overhead in terms of database operations.\n   4. Returning a 302\
    \ response indicating the service proxy as a new\n      contact, causing the upstream\
    \ node processing the 302 (ostensibly\n      the UA) to retransmit the request\
    \ toward the service proxy.  While\n      this shares the database operation of\
    \ the previous alternative, it\n      does explicitly allow for caching the 302\
    \ response thereby\n      potentially reducing the frequency and number of database\n\
    \      operations.\n   5. Performing an operation equivalent to record-routing\
    \ in a REGISTER\n      transaction between the UA and the associated registrar,\
    \ then\n      storing that route in the UA and reusing it as a service route on\n\
    \      future requests originating from the UA.  While efficient, this\n     \
    \ constrains the service route for proxy operations to be congruent\n      with\
    \ the route taken by the REGISTER message.\n   6. Returning service route information\
    \ as the value of a header field\n      in the REGISTER response.  While similar\
    \ to the previous\n      alternative, this approach grants the ability for the\
    \ registrar to\n      selectively apply knowledge about the topology of the home\
    \ network\n      in constructing the service route.\n   This document defines\
    \ this final alternative: returning the service\n   route information as a header\
    \ field in the REGISTER response.  This\n   new header field indicates a \"preloaded\
    \ route\" that the UA may wish\n   to use if requesting services from the proxy\
    \ network associated with\n   the registrar generating the response.\n   Scenario\n\
    \      UA1----P1-----|    |--R-------|\n                    |    |          |\n\
    \                    P2---|         DBMS\n                    |    |         \
    \ |\n      UA2-----------|    |--HSP-----|\n   In this scenario, we have a \"\
    home network\" containing routing proxy\n   P2, registrar R, home service proxy\
    \ HSP, and database DBMS used by\n   both R and HSP.  P2 represents the \"edge\"\
    \ of the home network from a\n   SIP perspective, and might be called an \"edge\
    \ proxy\".  UA1 is an\n   external UA behind proxy P1.  UA1 discovers P1 via Dynamic\
    \ Host\n   Configuration Protocol (DHCP) (this is just an example, and other\n\
    \   mechanisms besides DHCP are possible).  UA2 is another UA on the\n   Internet,\
    \ and does not use a default outbound proxy.  We do not show\n   Domain Name System\
    \ (DNS) elements in this diagram, but will assume\n   their reasonable availability\
    \ in the discussion.  The mission is for\n   UA1 to discover HSP so that outbound\
    \ requests from UA1 may be routed\n   (at the discretion of UA1) through HSP,\
    \ thereby receiving outbound\n   services from HSP.\n"
- title: 3.  Discussion of Mechanism
  contents:
  - "3.  Discussion of Mechanism\n   UAs may include a Route header field in an initial\
    \ request to force\n   that request to visit and potentially be serviced by one\
    \ or more\n   proxies.  Using such a route (called a \"service route\" or \"preloaded\n\
    \   route\") allows a UA to request services from a specific home proxy or\n \
    \  network of proxies.  The open question is, \"How may a UA discover\n   what\
    \ service route to use?\"\n   This document defines a header field called \"Service-Route\"\
    \ which can\n   contain a route vector that, if used as discussed above, will\
    \ direct\n   requests through a specific sequence of proxies.  A registrar may\
    \ use\n   a Service-Route header field to inform a UA of a service route that,\n\
    \   if used by the UA, will provide services from a proxy or set of\n   proxies\
    \ associated with that registrar.  The Service-Route header\n   field may be included\
    \ by a registrar in the response to a REGISTER\n   request.  Consequently, a registering\
    \ UA learns of a service route\n   that may be used to request services from the\
    \ system it just\n   registered with.\n   The routing established by the Service-Route\
    \ mechanism applies only\n   to requests originating in the user agent.  That\
    \ is, it applies only\n   to UA originated requests, and not to requests terminated\
    \ by that UA.\n   Simply put, the registrar generates a service route for the\n\
    \   registering UA and returns it in the response to each successful\n   REGISTER\
    \ request.  This service route has the form of a Route header\n   field that the\
    \ registering UA may use to send requests through the\n   service proxy selected\
    \ by the registrar.  The UA would use this route\n   by inserting it as a preloaded\
    \ Route header field in requests\n   originated by the UA intended for routing\
    \ through the service proxy.\n   The mechanism by which the registrar constructs\
    \ the header field\n   value is specific to the local implementation and outside\
    \ the scope\n   of this document.\n"
- title: 4.  Applicability Statement
  contents:
  - "4.  Applicability Statement\n   The Service-Route mechanism is applicable when:\n\
    \   1. The UA registers with a registrar.\n   2. The registrar has knowledge of\
    \ a service proxy that should be used\n      by the UA when requesting services\
    \ from the domain of the\n      registrar.  This knowledge may be a result of\
    \ dynamic assignment\n      or some other mechanism outside the scope of this\
    \ document.\n   3. The registrar(s) has/have sufficient knowledge of the network\n\
    \      topology, policy, and situation such that a reasonable service\n      route\
    \ can be constructed.\n   4. The service route constructed by the registrar is\
    \ the same for all\n      contacts associated with a single address-of-record.\
    \  This\n      mechanism does not provide for contact-specific service routes.\n\
    \   5. Other mechanisms for proposing a service route to the UA are not\n    \
    \  available or are inappropriate for use within the specific\n      environment.\n\
    \   Other methods may also be available by which a UA may be informed of\n   a\
    \ service route.  Such alternative methods are outside the scope of\n   this document.\
    \  Discussion of why one might wish to assign a service\n   route during registration\
    \ or when it might be appropriate to do so is\n   outside the scope of this document.\n"

- title: 6.1.  Procedures at the UA
  contents:
  - "6.1.  Procedures at the UA\n   The UA performs a registration as usual.  The\
    \ REGISTER response may\n   contain a Service-Route header field.  If so, the\
    \ UA MAY store the\n   value of the Service-Route header field in an association\
    \ with the\n   address-of-record for which the REGISTER transaction had registered\
    \ a\n   contact.  If the UA supports multiple addresses-of-record, it may be\n\
    \   able to store multiple service routes, one per address-of-record.  If\n  \
    \ the UA refreshes the registration, the stored value of the Service-\n   Route\
    \ is updated according to the Service-Route header field of the\n   latest 200\
    \ class response.  If there is no Service-Route header field\n   in the response,\
    \ the UA clears any service route for that address-\n   of-record previously stored\
    \ by the UA.  If the re-registration\n   request is refused or if an existing\
    \ registration expires and the UA\n   chooses not to re-register, the UA SHOULD\
    \ discard any stored service\n   route for that address-of-record.\n   The UA\
    \ MAY choose to exercise a service route for future requests\n   associated with\
    \ a given address-of-record for which a service route\n   is known.  If so, it\
    \ uses the content of the Service-Route header\n   field as a preloaded Route\
    \ header field in outgoing initial requests\n   [3].  The UA MUST preserve the\
    \ order, in case there is more than one\n   Service-Route header field or header\
    \ field value.\n   Loose routes may interact with routing policy in interesting\
    \ ways.\n   The specifics of how the service route set integrates with any\n \
    \  locally required default route and local policy are implementation\n   dependent.\
    \  For example, some devices will use locally-configured\n   explicit loose routing\
    \ to reach a next-hop proxy, and others will use\n   a default outbound-proxy\
    \ routing rule.  However, for the result to\n   function, the combination MUST\
    \ provide valid routing in the local\n   environment.  In general, the service\
    \ route set is appended to any\n   locally configured route needed to egress the\
    \ access proxy chain.\n   Systems designers must match the service routing policy\
    \ of their\n   nodes with the basic SIP routing policy in order to get a workable\n\
    \   system.\n"
- title: 6.2.  Procedures at the Proxy
  contents:
  - "6.2.  Procedures at the Proxy\n   The Service-Route header field is generally\
    \ treated like any other\n   unknown header field by intermediate proxies.  They\
    \ simply forward it\n   on towards the destination.  Note that, as usual, intermediate\n\
    \   proxies that need to be traversed by future requests within a dialog\n   may\
    \ record-route.  Proxies should not assume that they will be\n   traversed by\
    \ future requests in a dialog simply because they appear\n   in the Service-Route\
    \ header field.\n   There is a question of whether proxies processing a REGISTER\
    \ response\n   may add themselves to the route set in the Service-Route header\n\
    \   field.  While this would enable dynamic construction of service\n   routes,\
    \ it has two significant problems.  The first is one of\n   transparency, as seen\
    \ by the registrar: Intermediate proxies could\n   add themselves without the\
    \ knowledge or consent of the registrar.\n   The second problem is interaction\
    \ with end-to-end security.  If the\n   registrar uses S/MIME techniques to protect\
    \ the REGISTER response,\n   such additions would be visible to the UA as \"man\
    \ in the middle\"\n   alterations in the response.  Consequently, intermediate\
    \ proxies\n   SHOULD NOT alter the value of Service-Route in REGISTER responses,\n\
    \   and if they do, the UA MUST NOT be required to accept the alteration.\n  \
    \ Additional considerations apply if a proxy is \"dual homed\", meaning\n   connected\
    \ to two (or more) different networks such that requests are\n   received on one\
    \ interface and proxied out through another network\n   interface.  Proxies implementing\
    \ multi-homing precisely as documented\n   in [3] record-route a request with\
    \ the sending interface.  When\n   processing the reply, they replace the Record-Route\
    \ header field\n   value that represents the interface onto which they proxied\
    \ the\n   request with a new value that represents the interface onto which\n\
    \   they will proxy the response.  Consequently, the route vector seen at\n  \
    \ the User Agent Server (UAS) is not the exact inverse of the route\n   vector\
    \ seen at the User Agent Client (UAC).  While in itself\n   harmless, this complicates\
    \ matters for nodes that use the recorded\n   route vector (or recorded Path vector\
    \ as per [4]) in the\n   determination of a service route for future use.\n  \
    \ Instead of following the procedure in [3], proxies used with\n   Service-Route\
    \ that are inserting Record-Route or Path header field\n   values SHOULD record\
    \ not one but two route values when processing the\n   request.  The first value\
    \ recorded indicates the receiving interface,\n   and the second indicates the\
    \ sending interface.  When processing the\n   response, no modification of the\
    \ recorded route is required.  This\n   optimization provides for fully invertible\
    \ routes that can be\n   effectively used in construction of service routes.\n"
- title: 6.3.  Procedures at the Registrar
  contents:
  - "6.3.  Procedures at the Registrar\n   When a registrar receives a successful\
    \ REGISTER request, it MAY\n   choose to return one or more Service-Route header\
    \ field(s) in the 200\n   class response.  The determination(s) of whether to\
    \ include these\n   header fields(s) into the 200 class response and what value(s)\
    \ to\n   insert are a matter of local policy and outside the scope of this\n \
    \  document.\n   Having inserted a Service-Route header field or fields, the registrar\n\
    \   returns the 200 class response to the UA in accordance with standard\n   procedures.\n\
    \   A REGISTER operation performing a Fetching Bindings (i.e., no Contact\n  \
    \ header field is present in the request) SHOULD return the same value\n   of\
    \ Service-Route as returned in the corresponding previous REGISTER\n   response\
    \ for the address-of-record in question.  In some cases, the\n   Service-Route\
    \ may be dynamically calculated by the registrar rather\n   than stored, and the\
    \ decision as to whether this route should be\n   recalculated in the event of\
    \ a Fetching Bindings operation is left to\n   the implementation.\n   Note: A\
    \ Fetching Bindings operation could be used by the UA to\n         recover a lost\
    \ value of Service-Route.  Alternatively, a UA in\n         this situation could\
    \ just re-REGISTER.\n   Certain network topologies MAY require a specific proxy\
    \ (e.g.,\n   firewall proxy) to be traversed before the home service proxy.  Thus,\n\
    \   a registrar with specific knowledge of the network topology MAY\n   return\
    \ more than one Service-Route header field or element in the 200\n   class response;\
    \ the order is specified as top-down, meaning the\n   topmost Service-Route entry\
    \ will be visited first.  Such\n   constructions are implementation specific and\
    \ outside the scope of\n   this document.\n   In general, the Service-Route header\
    \ field contains references to\n   elements strictly within the administrative\
    \ domain of the registrar\n   and home service proxy.  For example, consider a\
    \ case where a user\n   leaves the \"home\" network and roams into a \"visited\"\
    \ network.  The\n   registrar cannot be assumed to have knowledge of the topology\
    \ of the\n   visited network, so the Service-Route it returns contains elements\n\
    \   only within the home network.\n   Note that the inserted Service-Route element(s)\
    \ MUST conform to the\n   syntax of a Route element as defined in [3].  As suggested\
    \ therein,\n   such route elements MUST include the loose-routing indicator\n\
    \   parameter \";lr\" for full compliance with [3].\n"

- title: 7.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "7.  Security Considerations\n   It is possible for proxies between the UA and\
    \ the registrar during\n   the REGISTER transaction to modify the value of Service-Route\n\
    \   returned by the registrar, or to insert a Service-Route even when one\n  \
    \ was not returned by the registrar.  The consequence of such an attack\n   is\
    \ that future requests made by the UA using the service route might\n   be diverted\
    \ to or through a node other than would normally be\n   visited.  It is also possible\
    \ for proxies on the INVITE path to\n   execute many different attacks.  It is\
    \ therefore desirable to apply\n   transitive mutual authentication using sips:\
    \ or other available\n   mechanisms in order to prevent such attacks.\n   The\
    \ \"sips:\" URI as defined in [3] defines a mechanism by which a UA\n   may request\
    \ transport-level message integrity and mutual\n   authentication.  Since there\
    \ is no requirement for proxies to modify\n   messages, S/MIME signed bodies may\
    \ be used to provide end-to-end\n   protection for the returned value.\n   Systems\
    \ using Service-Route SHOULD provide hop-by-hop message\n   integrity and mutual\
    \ authentication.  UAs SHOULD request this support\n   by using a \"sips:\" URI.\
    \  Registrars returning a Service-Route MUST\n   implement end-to-end protection\
    \ using S/MIME and SHOULD use S/MIME to\n   protect all such responses.  UAs receiving\
    \ Service-Route SHOULD\n   authenticate attached S/MIME bodies if present.\n"
