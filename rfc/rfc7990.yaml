  contents:
  - "Abstract\n   In order to improve the readability of RFCs while supporting their\n\
    \   archivability, the canonical format of the RFC Series will be\n   transitioning\
    \ from plain-text ASCII to XML using the xml2rfc version\n   3 vocabulary; different\
    \ publication formats will be rendered from\n   that base document.  With these\
    \ changes comes an increase in\n   complexity for authors, consumers, and the\
    \ publisher of RFCs.  This\n   document serves as the framework that provides\
    \ the problem statement,\n   lays out a road map of the documents that capture\
    \ the specific\n   requirements, and describes the transition plan.\n"

  - "1.  Introduction\n   \"RFC Series Format Requirements and Future Development\"\
    \ [RFC6949]\n   discusses the need to improve the display of items such as author\n\
    \   names and artwork in RFCs as well as the need to improve the ability\n   of\
    \ RFCs to be displayed properly on various devices.  Based on the\n   discussions\
    \ with communities of interest, such as the IETF, the RFC\n   Series Editor decided\
    \ to explore a change to the format of the Series\n   [XML-ANNOUNCE].  This document\
    \ serves as the framework that describes\n   the problems being solved and summarizes\
    \ the documents created to-\n   date that capture the specific requirements for\
    \ each aspect of the\n   change in format.\n   Key changes to the publication\
    \ of RFCs are highlighted, and a\n   transition plan that will take the Series\
    \ from a plain text, ASCII-\n   only format to the new formats is described on\
    \ the rfc-interest\n   mailing list [RFC-INTEREST].\n   This document is concerned\
    \ with the production of RFCs, focusing on\n   the published formats.  It does\
    \ not address any changes to the\n   processes each stream uses to develop and\
    \ review their submissions\n   (specifically, how Internet-Drafts will be developed).\
    \  While I-Ds\n   have a similar set of issues and concerns, directly addressing\
    \ those\n   issues for I-Ds will be discussed within each document stream.\n \
    \  The details described in this document are expected to change based\n   on\
    \ experience gained in implementing the new publication toolsets.\n   Revised\
    \ documents will be published capturing those changes as the\n   toolsets are\
    \ completed.  Other implementers must not expect those\n   changes to remain backwards\
    \ compatible with the details described in\n   this document.\n"
- title: 2.  Problem Statement
  contents:
  - "2.  Problem Statement\n   There are nearly three billion people connected to\
    \ the Internet\n   [ISTATS] and individuals from at least 45 countries have regularly\n\
    \   attended IETF meetings over the last five years.  The Internet is now\n  \
    \ global, and while the world has changed from when the first RFCs were\n   published,\
    \ the Series remains critical to defining protocols,\n   standards, best practices,\
    \ and more for this global network that\n   continues to grow.  In order to make\
    \ RFCs easily viewable to the\n   largest number of people possible, across a\
    \ wide array of devices,\n   and to respect the diversity of authors and reference\
    \ materials while\n   still recognizing the archival aspects of the Series, it\
    \ is time to\n   update the tightly prescribed format of the RFC Series.\n   All\
    \ changes to the format of the RFC Series must be made with\n   consideration\
    \ to the requirements of a wide set of communities over\n   an extended length\
    \ of time.  Examples of the preferences and specific\n   needs are those of existing\
    \ authors and implementers, lawyers that\n   argue Intellectual Property Rights\
    \ (IPR), educators, managers, and\n   policymakers that need to know what to list\
    \ in potential Request for\n   Proposals (RFPs) for their organizations.  The\
    \ immediate needs of\n   today's communities must be balanced with the needs for\
    \ long-term\n   archival storage.\n"

  - "3.  Terminology\n   This document uses terminology from RFC 6949, repeated below\
    \ for\n   convenience.\n      ASCII: Coded Character Set - 7-bit American Standard\

- title: 4.  Overview of the Decision-Making Process
  contents:
  - "4.  Overview of the Decision-Making Process\n   Requirements, use cases, concerns,\
    \ and suggestions were collected\n   from the communities of interest at every\
    \ stage of the project to\n   update the RFC format.  Input was received through\
    \ the rfc-interest\n   mailing list, as well as in several face-to-face sessions\
    \ at IETF\n   meetings.  Regular conversations were held with the Chairs of the\n\
    \   IETF, IRTF, IAB, and IAOC as well as the Independent Stream Editor to\n  \
    \ discuss high-level stream requirements.  Updates regarding the status\n   of\
    \ the project were provided to the IETF community during the IETF\n   Technical\
    \ Plenary as well as Format BoFs or IAB sessions at several\n   IETF meetings\
    \ [IETF84] [IETF85] [IETF88] [IETF89] [IETF90].\n   The output from the first\
    \ year of discussion on the topic of RFC\n   format was published as RFC 6949,\
    \ which provided the first solid\n   documentation on the requirements for the\
    \ Series.  RFC 6949 is a\n   product of the IAB stream (following the process\
    \ described in\n   \"Process for Publication of IAB RFCs\" [RFC4845]).  This is\
    \ also the\n   case with all of the RFCs that informed the format update work.\n\
    \   After the high-level requirements were published, the RFC Series\n   Editor\
    \ (RSE) brought together an RFC Format Design Team to start\n   working out the\
    \ necessary details to develop the code needed to\n   create new and changed formats.\
    \  The Design Team discussed moving\n   away from the existing xml2rfc vocabulary,\
    \ but with such a strong\n   existing support base within the community and no\
    \ clear value with\n   other XML vocabularies or schemas, the decision was made\
    \ to work with\n   the xml2rfc version 2 (xml2rfc v2) [RFC7749] model and use\
    \ it as the\n   base for the new format environment.  Part of this discussion\n\
    \   included a decision to stop using an XML document type definition\n   (DTD)\
    \ in favor of a Regular Language for XML Next General (RELAX NG)\n   model using\
    \ a defined vocabulary.  While the biweekly calls for this\n   team were limited\
    \ to Design Team members, review of the decisions as\n   documented in the documents\
    \ produced by this team was done publicly\n   through requests for feedback on\
    \ the rfc-interest mailing list.\n   Several of the documents produced by the\
    \ Design Team, including those\n   on xml2rfc v2 [RFC7749] and v3 [RFC7991] and\
    \ the SVG profile\n   [RFC7996], were sent through an early GenART review [GEN-ART]\
    \ before\n   starting the process to be accepted by the IAB stream.\n   While\
    \ the IETF community provided the majority of input on the\n   process, additional\
    \ outreach opportunities were sought to gain input\n   from an even broader audience.\
    \  Informal discussions were held with\n   participants at several International\
    \ Association of Scientific,\n   Technical, and Medical Publisher events [STM],\
    \ and presentations made\n   at technical conferences such as the TERENA Networking\
    \ Conference\n   2014 [TNC2014] and NORDUnet 2014 [NDN2014].\n   In order to respond\
    \ to concerns regarding responses to subpoenas and\n   to understand the legal\
    \ requirements, advice was requested from the\n   IETF Trust legal team regarding\
    \ what format or formats would be\n   considered reasonable when responding to\
    \ a subpoena request for an\n   RFC.\n   Given that several other standards development\
    \ organizations (SDOs)\n   do not offer plain-text documents, and in fact may\
    \ offer more than\n   one format for their standards, informal input was sought\
    \ from them\n   regarding their experience with supporting one or more non-plain-text\n\
    \   formats for their standards.\n   Finally, the entire process was reviewed\
    \ regularly with the RFC\n   Series Oversight Committee [RSOC] and regular updates\
    \ provided to the\n   IAB and IESG.  They have offered support and input throughout\
    \ the\n   process.\n   Where consensus was not reached during the process, the\
    \ RSE made any\n   necessary final decisions, as per the guidance in \"RFC Editor\
    \ Model\n   (Version 2)\" [RFC6635].\n"
- title: 5.  Key Changes
  contents:
  - "5.  Key Changes\n   At the highest level, the changes being made to the RFC format\n\
    \   involve breaking away from solely ASCII plain text and moving to a\n   canonical\
    \ format that includes all the information required for\n   rendering a document\
    \ into a wide variety of publication formats.  The\n   RFC Editor will become\
    \ responsible for more than just the plain-text\n   file and the PDF-from-text\
    \ format created at time of publication; the\n   RFC Editor will be creating several\
    \ different formats in order to\n   meet the diverse requirements of the community.\n\
    \   The final XML file produced by the RFC Editor will be considered the\n   canonical\
    \ format for RFCs; it is the lowest common denominator that\n   holds all the\
    \ information intended for an RFC.  PDF/A-3 will be the\n   publication format\
    \ offered in response to subpoenas for RFCs\n   published through this new process\
    \ and will be developed with an eye\n   towards long-term archival storage.  HTML\
    \ will be the focus of\n   providing the most flexible set of features for an\
    \ RFC, including\n   JavaScript to provide pointers to errata and other metadata.\
    \  Plain\n   text will continue to be offered in order to support existing tool\n\
    \   chains, where practicable, and the individuals who prefer to read\n   RFCs\
    \ in this format.\n"

- title: 6.1.  XML for RFCs
  contents:
  - "6.1.  XML for RFCs\n   Key points regarding the XML format:\n   o  The canonical\
    \ format for RFCs is XML using the xml2rfc version 3\n      (xml2rfc v3) vocabulary.\
    \  The XML file must contain all\n      information necessary to render a variety\
    \ of formats; any question\n      about what was intended in the publication will\
    \ be answered from\n      this format.\n   o  Authors may submit documents using\
    \ the xml2rfc v2 vocabulary, but\n      the final publication will be converted\
    \ to use the xml2rfc v3\n      vocabulary.\n   o  SVG is supported and will be\
    \ embedded in the final XML file.\n   o  There will be automatically generated\
    \ identifiers for sections,\n      paragraphs, figures, and tables in the final\
    \ XML file.\n   o  The XML file will not contain any xml2rfc v3 vocabulary elements\n\
    \      or attributes that have been marked deprecated.\n   o  A DTD will no longer\
    \ be used.  The grammar will be defined using\n      RELAX NG [RNC].\n   o  The\
    \ final XML file will contain, verbatim, the appropriate\n      boilerplate as\
    \ applicable at time of publication specified by RFC\n      7841 [RFC7841] or\
    \ its successors.\n   o  The final XML will be self-contained with all the information\n\
    \      known at publication time.  For instance, all features that\n      reference\
    \ externally defined input will be expanded.  This\n      includes all uses of\
    \ xinclude, src attributes (such as in\n      <artwork> or <sourcecode> elements),\
    \ include-like processing\n      instructions, and externally defined entities.\n\
    \   o  The final XML will not contain comments or processing\n      instructions.\n\
    \   o  The final XML will not contain src attributes for <artwork> or\n      <sourcecode>\
    \ elements.\n   [RFC7749] describes the xml2rfc v2 vocabulary.  While in wide\
    \ use at\n   the time of writing, this vocabulary had not been formally documented\n\
    \   prior to the publication of RFC 7749.  In order to understand what\n   needed\
    \ to change in the vocabulary to allow for a more simple\n   experience and additional\
    \ features for authors, the current\n   vocabulary needed to be fully described.\
    \  RFC 7749 will be obsoleted\n   by [RFC7991].\n   [RFC7991] describes the xml2rfc\
    \ v3 vocabulary.  The design goals were\n   to make the vocabulary more intuitive\
    \ for authors and to expand the\n   features to support the changes being made\
    \ in the publication\n   process.  It obsoletes RFC 7749.\n"

  - "10.1.  Statement of Work and RFP for Tool Development\n   Existing tools for\
    \ the creation of RFCs will need to be updated, and\n   new tools created, to\
    \ implement the updated format.  As the\n   requirements-gathering effort, described\
    \ in the various documents\n   described earlier in this document, finishes the\
    \ bulk of the work,\n   the Tools Development Team of the IETF will work with\
    \ the RSE to\n   develop Statements of Work (SoWs).  Those SoWs will first be\
    \ reviewed\n   within the Tools Development Team and the Tools Management Committee,\n\
    \   and it will then go out for a public comment period.  After public\n   review,\
    \ the SoWs will be attached to an RFP and posted as per the\n   IETF Administrative\
    \ Support Activity (IASA) bid process [IASA-RFP].\n   Once bids have been received,\
    \ reviewed, and awarded, coding will\n   begin.\n"
- title: 10.2.  Testing and Transition
  contents:
  - "10.2.  Testing and Transition\n   During the I-D review and approval process,\
    \ authors and stream-\n   approving bodies will select drafts to run through the\
    \ proposed new\n   publication process.  The RFC Editor will process these documents\n\
    \   after they have been approved for publication using xml2rfc v2 and\n   will\
    \ simultaneously test the selected I-Ds with the xml2rfc v3\n   process and tools.\
    \  While the final RFCs published during this time\n   will continue as plain\
    \ text and immutable once published, the\n   feedback process is necessary to\
    \ bootstrap initial testing.  These\n   early tests will target finding issues\
    \ with the proposed xml2rfc v3\n   vocabulary that result in poorly formed publication\
    \ formats as well\n   as issues that prevent proper review of submitted documents.\n\
    \   Feedback will result in regular iteration of the basic code and XML\n   vocabulary.\
    \  In order to limit the amount of time the RFC Production\n   Center (RPC) spends\
    \ on testing and quality assurance (QA), their\n   priority will be to edit and\
    \ publish documents; therefore, community\n   assistance will be necessary to\
    \ help move this stage along.  A\n   mailing list and experimental source directory\
    \ on the RFC Editor\n   website will be created for community members willing\
    \ to assist in\n   the detailed review of the XML and publication formats.  Editorial\n\
    \   checks of the publication formats by the community are out of scope;\n   the\
    \ focus will be the QA of each available output, checking for\n   inconsistencies\
    \ across formats.\n   The purpose of the testing phase is to work with the community\
    \ to\n   identify and fix bugs in the process and the code before producing\n\
    \   canonical, immutable XML, and to collect additional feedback on the\n   usability\
    \ of the new publication formats.\n   Any modifications to the document review\
    \ process, up to and including\n   AUTH48, will happen with the community and\
    \ the stream-approving\n   bodies as we learn more about the features and outputs\
    \ of the new\n   publication tools.  Defining those processes is out of scope\
    \ for this\n   document.\n   Success will be measured by the closure of all bugs\
    \ identified by the\n   RPC and the Tools Development Team as fatal in addition\
    \ to reaching\n   rough consensus with the community on the readiness of the XML\n\
    \   vocabulary and final output files for publication.  The actual\n   rendering\
    \ engine can go through further review and iteration, as the\n   publication formats\
    \ may be republished as needed.\n   Authors are not required to submit their approved\
    \ drafts to the RFC\n   Editor in an XML format, though they are strongly encouraged\
    \ to do\n   so; plain text will also remain an option for the foreseeable future.\n\
    \   However, documents submitted as plain text cannot include such\n   features\
    \ as SVG artwork.  The RPC will generate an XML file if\n   necessary for basic\
    \ processing and subsequent rendering into the\n   approved output formats.\n\
    \   A known risk at this point of the transition is the difficulty in\n   quantifying\
    \ the resources required from the RPC.  This phase will\n   require more work\
    \ on the part of the RPC to support both old and new\n   publication processes\
    \ for at least six months.  There is potential\n   for confusion as consumers\
    \ of RFCs find some documents published at\n   this time with a full set of outputs,\
    \ while older documents only have\n   plain text.  There may be a delay in publication\
    \ as new bugs are\n   found that must be fixed before the files can be converted\
    \ into the\n   canonical format and associated publication formats.\n"
- title: 10.3.  Completion
  contents:
  - "10.3.  Completion\n   Authors may submit XML (preferred) or plain-text files.\
    \  The XML\n   files submitted for publication will be converted to canonical\
    \ XML\n   format and published with all available publication formats.  All\n\
    \   authors will be expected to review the final documents as consistent\n   with\
    \ the evolving procedures for reviewing documents.\n   Success for this phase\
    \ will be measured by a solid understanding by\n   the RSE and the IAOC of the\
    \ necessary costs and resources required\n   for long-term support of the new\
    \ format model.\n"
- title: 11.  Security Considerations

  - "11.  Security Considerations\n   Changing the format for RFCs involves modifying\
    \ a great number of\n   components to publication.  Understanding those changes\
    \ and the\n   implications for the entire tool chain is critical so as to avoid\n\
    \   unintended bugs that would allow unintended changes to text.\n   Unintended\
    \ changes to text could in turn corrupt a standard,\n   practice, or critical\
    \ piece of information about a protocol.\n"
