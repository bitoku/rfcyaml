  - "1.  Introduction\n   Every version of the FTP specification has added a few new\
    \ commands,\n   with the early ones summarized in RFC 959 [RFC0959].  RFC 2389\n\
    \   [RFC2389] established a mechanism for specifying and negotiating\n   extensions\
    \ to the FTP protocol specified in RFC 959, by means of\n   \"FEAT Strings\" identifying\
    \ extensions supported by the FTP server,\n   and sent in response to a \"FEAT\"\
    \ command.  The number of extensions\n   continues to grow, not all of them supported\
    \ by FEAT.  An IANA\n   registry is established to reduce the likelihood of a\
    \ conflict of\n   names and the consequent ambiguity and to encourage the sharing\
    \ of\n   information.  This specification establishes that registry.\n"

- title: 2.1.  Registry Name
  contents:
  - "2.1.  Registry Name\n   The name of this registry is \"FTP Commands and Extensions\"\
    .\n"
- title: 2.2.  Registry Format
  contents:
  - "2.2.  Registry Format\n   As specified in this RFC, IANA has established a registry\
    \ for FTP\n   commands and extensions.  Registration requests and registry entries\n\
    \   should include the following:\n   Command Name -  The FTP command, either\
    \ new or modified, used in the\n      extension or with which the extension is\
    \ used.\n      Following the long-standing practice to capitalize command names\n\
    \      in specification documents for FTP, the command names are entered\n   \
    \   in all uppercase.  For extensions amending the operation of a\n      command,\
    \ a plus sign (\"+\") is appended to the command name.\n      However, if an extension\
    \ affects the overall command parameter\n      handling and/or transaction processing,\
    \ instead of being bound to\n      one command (or a small number of commands),\
    \ the string \"-N/A-\" is\n      entered.\n      It is intended to have the registry\
    \ entries ordered by ascending\n      ASCII collation order of this column (including\
    \ the \"+\" suffix if\n      present).\n   Extension name -  The name of the extension.\n\
    \      FTP extensions predating RFC 2389 [RFC2389], and some extensions\n    \
    \  published after it, did not specify a keyword to identify the\n      extension\
    \ in a FEAT response.  Some later specifications\n      established FEAT strings\
    \ with the respective command names as\n      their keywords.  In order to provide\
    \ for keywords for future\n      specifications in such cases, this document establishes\n\
    \      'placeholder' keywords to reserve reasonable feature names for\n      future\
    \ standardization.  Similarly, placeholder keywords are used\n      for the basic\
    \ FTP commands specified in RFC 959 [RFC0959] and\n      those of its predecessors\
    \ that are still in use.  These\n      placeholder keywords are placed in the\
    \ registry for convenience;\n      it is not intended that they be returned in\
    \ FEAT responses.\n      To compensate for this idiosyncrasy, the column in the\
    \ registry is\n      entitled \"FEAT Code\", and to clearly distinguish between\
    \ the two\n      cases, defined FEAT keywords codes are listed in all uppercase,\n\
    \      whereas placeholder keywords (henceforth called \"pseudo FEAT\n      codes\"\
    ) are listed in lowercase.  Future specifications are\n      allowed to \"upgrade\"\
    \ a placeholder to a true keyword unless it is\n      specifically declared 'immutable'\
    \ below, but otherwise IANA\n      maintains uniqueness of feature names (FEAT\
    \ codes) based on case-\n      insensitive comparison.\n   Description -  A brief\
    \ description of the extension and, where\n      appropriate, the command.\n \
    \  FEAT String -  (optional in registration requests to IANA)\n      The string\
    \ expected to be included in the response to the FEAT\n      command [RFC2389]\
    \ if the extension is supported.\n      In many cases, the FEAT string required\
    \ to identify an extension\n      only consists of the \"FEAT Code\", making this\
    \ item redundant.\n      Therefore, this item should only be specified if it is\
    \ intended to\n      register a FEAT string that contains mandatory elements other\
    \ than\n      the \"FEAT Code\" itself.\n      Due to space restrictions, and\
    \ to allow registrants to provide\n      additional information, IANA should present\
    \ these registration\n      items (if given) in numbered footnotes to the table,\
    \ not in an\n      additional table column.\n   Command Type -  The type (or 'kind')\
    \ of the command.\n      Section 4.1 of RFC 959 [RFC0959] introduced a subdivision\
    \ of FTP\n      commands into three types: Access control, transfer Parameter\n\
    \      {setting}, and Service {execution}.  For clarity, and as a service\n  \
    \    to the user of the registry, this subdivision is extended to all\n      registered\
    \ FTP commands, using the characteristic initial of the\n      type, 'a', 'p',\
    \ or 's', respectively, filed in the registry column\n      titled \"type\"; combinations\
    \ are allowed, e.g., 'p/s'.\n   Conformance Requirements -  The support expectation\
    \ for the command.\n      RFC 959 specifies mandatory-to-implement commands and\
    \ optional\n      commands.  This classification is carried over to all registered\n\
    \      commands, using a column titled \"conf\" carrying a single character\n\
    \      -- either 'm' or 'o', for \"mandatory\" and \"optional\",\n      respectively.\
    \  Similarly, obsoleted or historic entries are left\n      in the registry to\
    \ avoid conflicts with deployed implementations,\n      and these entries are\
    \ marked with 'h' (for \"historic\").\n      Beyond the initial registrations,\
    \ Standards Action [RFC5226] is\n      needed to register new \"mandatory\" entries\
    \ or to move such entries\n      to \"historic\".\n   Reference -  A reference\
    \ to an RFC or other definition of the\n      extension and/or to implementations\
    \ supporting it (see the next\n      section).\n"
- title: 2.3.  Criteria for Registration
  contents:
  - "2.3.  Criteria for Registration\n   This registry is primarily intended to avoid\
    \ conflicting uses of the\n   same extension names and command keywords for different\
    \ purposes, not\n   to demonstrate that an extension is somehow \"approved\".\
    \  The \"Expert\n   Review\" method will be used, but the designated expert is\
    \ expected to\n   check only that at least one of the two criteria that follow\
    \ are met.\n   1.  The extension is documented in a permanent and readily available\n\
    \       public specification (this is the same as the \"Specification\n      \
    \ Required\" registration policy defined in RFC 5226 [RFC5226]).\n   2.  The extension\
    \ is actually implemented in FTP client and server\n       systems that are generally\
    \ available (not necessarily either free\n       or unencumbered, but available).\n\
    \   For an extension or command to be marked \"mandatory\" ('m' in the\n   \"\
    conf\" column), an IETF Standards Track specification is required.\n   An IESG\
    \ Standards Action is allowed to direct IANA to change the\n   Conformance Requirements\
    \ listed for any entry.\n"
- title: 2.4.  Base FTP Commands
  contents:
  - "2.4.  Base FTP Commands\n   The following commands are part of the base FTP specification\n\
    \   [RFC0959] and are listed in the registry with the immutable pseudo\n   FEAT\
    \ code \"base\".\n      Mandatory commands:\n      ABOR, ACCT, ALLO, APPE, CWD,\
    \ DELE, HELP, LIST, MODE, NLST, NOOP,\n      PASS, PASV, PORT, QUIT, REIN, REST,\
    \ RETR, RNFR, RNTO, SITE, STAT,\n      STOR, STRU, TYPE, USER\n      Optional\
    \ commands:\n      CDUP, MKD, PWD, RMD, SMNT, STOU, SYST\n   Note: STD 3 [RFC1123]\
    \ clarified and updated the status and\n   implementation requirements of these\
    \ standard FTP commands, and it\n   contains important complementary information\
    \ for the following\n   commands:\n      LIST, NLST, PASV, REST, SITE, STOU\n"
- title: 2.5.  Obsolete Commands
  contents:
  - "2.5.  Obsolete Commands\n   The following commands were specified as experimental\
    \ in an extension\n   to an early version of the FTP specification [RFC0775] but\
    \ later\n   deprecated by RFC 1123 [RFC1123], because Standard FTP [RFC0959]\n\
    \   specifies their standard successors.  They are listed in the registry\n  \
    \ with the immutable pseudo FEAT code \"hist\".\n      XCUP, XCWD, XMKD, XPWD,\
    \ XRMD\n   Implementation note:  Deployed FTP clients still make use of the\n\
    \      deprecated commands and most FTP servers support them as aliases\n    \
    \  for the standard commands.\n   The following commands were specified as part\
    \ of the \"FOOBAR\" IPng\n   effort in RFC 1545 [RFC1545] and, later, RFC 1639\
    \ [RFC1639] and are\n   now obsolete.  They are listed in the registry with the\
    \ immutable\n   pseudo FEAT code \"hist\".\n      LPRT, LPSV\n"

  - "4.  Acknowledgments\n   Any work to update or extend FTP depends on the base\
    \ specification in\n   RFC 959.  The contributions of its editors, Jon Postel\
    \ and Joyce\n   Reynolds, are gratefully acknowledged.  The option-negotiation\n\
    \   mechanism specified in RFC 2389 (and the accumulation of features\n   that\
    \ followed it) made this registry relevant; the authors of those\n   documents\
    \ are acknowledged as well.\n   Barry Leiba and Alexey Melnikov made several suggestions\
    \ about\n   earlier versions of this document, most of which have been\n   incorporated.\n\
    \   Anthony Bryan spotted a few typographical errors.\n   Scott Bradner suggested\
    \ a clarification to the \"Expert Review\" text.\n   The authors appreciate the\
    \ comments and support for this work\n   received from FTP implementers and many\
    \ IETF participants.  Comments\n   from the IESG helped to shape this document\
    \ and registry to improve\n   its utility.\n"
- title: 5.  IANA Considerations
  contents:
  - "5.  IANA Considerations\n   IANA has established the registry described in Section\
    \ 2 using the\n   initial content specified in Section 3 and including the body\
    \ of\n   Sections 2.4 and 2.5 as explanatory text in the preface of the\n   registry.\n\
    \   New entries should be added to this registry when extensions to FTP\n   are\
    \ approved or defined in RFCs or when extensions that are already\n   in use and\
    \ well-documented are identified.  In other words, the\n   requirement for registration\
    \ is a slightly relaxed version of\n   \"Specification Required\" [RFC5226] with\
    \ Expert Review.  See\n   Section 2.3 for specifics and exceptions.\n"
- title: 6.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "6.  Security Considerations\n   The creation of this registry provides improved\
    \ documentation and\n   protection against interoperability problems.  It introduces\
    \ no new\n   security issues.\n"
