  - "Abstract\n   This memo provides an update and clarification to RFC 1816.  This\n\
    \   document describes the registration policies for the top-level domain\n  \
    \ \".GOV\".  The purpose of the domain is to provide naming conventions\n   that\
    \ identify US Federal government agencies in order to facilitate\n   access to\
    \ their electronic resources.  This memo provides guidance\n   for registrations\
    \ by Federal Agencies that avoids name duplication\n   and facilitates responsiveness\
    \ to the public.  It restricts\n   registrations to coincide with the approved\
    \ structure of the US\n   government and the advice of its Chief Information Officers.\
    \  Two\n   documents are recognized as constituting documentation on the US\n\
    \   government structure: FIPS 95-1 provides a standard recognized\n   structure\
    \ into which domain registrations for .GOV and FED.US can\n   fit; and, the US\
    \ Government Manual [3], a special publication of the\n   Federal Register, provides\
    \ official documentation of the government\n   structure. The latter document\
    \ may be subject to more timely updates\n   than the former.  Either document\
    \ is suitable for determining which\n   entities qualify for second-level domain\
    \ registration within .GOV and\n   FED.US.\n   As a side effect, this RFC reduces\
    \ the number of .GOV and FED.US\n   level registrations and reduces the workload\
    \ on the registration\n   authority.  Previous versions of this document did not\
    \ address the\n   FED.US domain.  This document anticipates the migration of the\
    \ .GOV\n   domain into the FED.US domain, in keeping with common practice on the\n\
    \   Internet today.\n"
- title: U.S. GOVERNMENT INTERNET DOMAIN NAMES POLICY
  contents:
  - "U.S. GOVERNMENT INTERNET DOMAIN NAMES POLICY\n   The .GOV domain is delegated\
    \ from the root authority to the US\n   Federal Networking Council.  The .GOV\
    \ domain is for registration of\n   US governmental entities on the federal level\
    \ only.  Registrations\n   for state and local governmental agencies shall be\
    \ made under the .US\n   domain in accordance with the policies for that domain.\
    \  Further\n   references in this document to .GOV should be understood to apply\
    \ to\n   FED.US as well.  The most succinct form of the policy is \"one agency,\n\
    \   one name\".  The agency may choose its own name, but an easily\n   recognized\
    \ acronym is suggested.  The following paragraphs enumerate\n   the types of agencies\
    \ eligible for registration and the types that\n   are not eligible:\n       \
    \  1) The document \"Codes for the Identification of Federal and\n      Federally\
    \ Assisted Organizations\", FIPS 95-1 (or its successor)\n      lists the official\
    \ names of US Government agencies.  Either that\n      document or the US Government\
    \ Manual can be used to determine that\n      an entity is eligible for registration\
    \ as a second level domain of\n      .GOV.\n              A) Top-level entities\
    \ (e.g., those in FIPS 95-1 with codes\n         ending in 00 such a\"1200 Department\
    \ of Agriculture\"), those in\n         the US Government Manual listed as \"\
    Departments, Independent\n         Establishments (not Corporations), and all\
    \ the Boards,\n         Commissions, and Committees\"), and independent agencies\
    \ and\n         organizations (e.g., \"National Science Foundation\" and other\n\
    \         non-indented listings unless prohibited below) as listed in\n      \
    \   this document are eligible for registration directly under\n         .GOV.\n\
    \              B) Cross-agency collaborative organizations (e.g.,\n         \"\
    Federal Networking Council\", \"Information Infrastructure Task\n         Force\"\
    ) are eligible for registration under .GOV upon\n         presentation of the\
    \ chartering document and are the only non-\n         FIPS-listed or non-US-Government-Manual-listed\
    \ organizations\n         eligible for registration under .GOV.\n            \
    \  C) Subsidiary, non-autonomous components of top-level or\n         other entities\
    \ are not eligible for separate registration.\n         International organizations\
    \ listed in this document are NOT\n         eligible for registration under .GOV.\
    \  Subsidiary components\n         should register as third-level domains under\
    \ their parent\n         organization.  Other Federal entities may apply to the\
    \ FED.US\n         domain.\n              D) Organizations listed as \"Federally\
    \ Aided Organizations\"\n         in FIPS 95-1 are not eligible for registration\
    \ under .GOV and\n         should register under .ORG or other appropriate top-level\n\
    \         domain that reflects their status.\n              E) Organizations subsidiary\
    \ to \"Department of Defense\"\n         must register under the \".MIL\" domain\
    \ via the Defense Data\n         Network Information Center - contact registrar@nic.ddn.mil.\n\
    \              F) Other entities may be registered by request of a\n         cognizant\
    \ Chief Information Officer (CIO); CIO's are those\n         agency officials\
    \ designated by the agency head in accordance\n         with the requirements\
    \ of the Information Technology Management\n         Reform Act of 1996 and Executive\
    \ Order 13011.\n              G) Federal Courts constitute a special class of\
    \ domains.\n         All Federal courts seeking domain registrations should contact\n\
    \         the Administrative Office of the US Courts for their guidance\n    \
    \     on policy and naming.\n            a) The string \"SUPREME-COURT\" is reserved\
    \ for the Supreme\n            Court domain.\n            b) All other courts\
    \ and their officers and officials should\n            register in .USCOURTS.GOV.\
    \  The only standard exceptions to\n            these rules are changes to governmental\
    \ structure due to\n            statutory, regulatory or executive directives\
    \ not yet\n            reflected in the above document.  The requesting agency\n\
    \            should provide documentation in one of the above forms to\n     \
    \       request an exception.  Other requests for exception should\n         \
    \   be referred to the Federal Networking Council.\n         2) A domain name\
    \ should be derived from the official name for\n      the organization (e.g.,\
    \ \"USDA.Gov\" or \"AGRICULTURE.GOV\".)  The\n      registration shall be listed\
    \ in the registration database under\n      the official name (per FIPS 95-1 or\
    \ US Government Manual) for the\n      organization or under the name in the chartering\
    \ document.\n         3) Only ONE registration and delegation shall be made for\
    \ the\n      purpose of identifying an agency.  The .GOV registration authority\n\
    \      shall provide registrations on a first-come first-served basis.\n     \
    \ It is an individual agency matter as to which portion of the\n      agency is\
    \ responsible for managing the domain space under a\n      delegated agency domain.\n\
    \         4) Those agencies and entities that had multiple registrations\n   \
    \   under .GOV may retain them until August 1998, but sub-delegations\n      will\
    \ be permitted only under the one name chosen by the agency as\n      its permanent\
    \ name.  As of August 1996, the auxiliary domains will\n      become un-delegated\
    \ and will revert to the control of the .GOV\n      owner.  As of 2 August 1997,\
    \ all registrations in the auxiliary\n      domains must be mirrored in the permanent\
    \ domain and those names\n      should be used where possible. At the three year\
    \ point, all\n      auxiliary domain registrations will be deleted (August 1998).\n\
    \         5) Those agencies and entities already registered in .GOV but\n    \
    \  not listed in FIPS 95-1 (e.g., DOE labs, state entities) or the US\n      Government\
    \ Manual may retain their registration within the\n      constraint of the single\
    \ registration rule (see para 4).  No\n      further non-listed registrations\
    \ will be made.  State and local\n      entities are strongly encouraged to re-register\
    \ under .US, but\n      this is not mandatory.\n"

- title: FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS / ANSWERS

  - "FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS / ANSWERS\n   EXISTING .GOV REGISTRATIONS\n      \
    \   Q.  What are examples of FIPS 95-1 Departments possessing\n      duplicate\
    \ top-level domain names, and what guidance has been given\n      to them regarding\
    \ these names?\n         A.  Examples of FIPS 95-1 Departments with duplicate\
    \ DNS'\n      include \"STATE.GOV\" and \"LABOR.GOV\".  These departments had\
    \ six\n      months (until December 1996) to determine which name is permanent\n\
    \      and which is auxiliary and three years to drop the auxiliary\n      registration.\n\
    \         Q.  Currently, our services are defined as www.cdc.gov,\n      ftp.cdc.gov,\
    \  and gopher.cdc.gov.  Does this proposal mean that\n      our names will now\
    \ be: www.ntb.ops.cdc.phs.dhhs.gov, etc or at a\n      minimum: www.cdc.phs.dhhs.gov,\
    \ ftp.cdc.phs.dhhs.gov, and\n      gopher.cdc.phs.dhhs.gov?\n         A.  In the\
    \ case of CDC, NIST, NIH, FDA, and the numerous other\n      non-FIPS-95-1 agencies\
    \ registered with \".GOV\" domains, there will\n      be no changes.  The existing\
    \ DNS' of these agencies are grand-\n      fathered under this policy.  In addition,\
    \ the policy effects only\n      the domains allowed to be registered directly\
    \ under .GOV; further\n      delegations are under the control of the sub-domain\
    \ owner.  For\n      the above, assuming the HHS sub-domain owner concurs, there\
    \ is no\n      problem with the HHS registering \"cdc.dhhs.gov\" as a sub-domain\
    \ of\n      \"dhhs.gov\".\n         Q.  How will registrations by Federal Laboratories\
    \ be\n      addressed?\n         A. The existing domain names will be grand-fathered,\
    \ i.e.,\n      LBL.GOV.  Any new registrations will generally be within the\n\
    \      domain of the sponsoring agency (and subject to agency policies),\n   \
    \   within the .US domain as a geographic entity, or within the FED.US\n     \
    \ domain.\n         Q.  What are some examples of state government agencies\n\
    \      registered under \".GOV\" domain?  Will they need to change their\n   \
    \   DNS?\n         A.  Examples of cities and states that originally registered\n\
    \      under the .GOV include:  WA.GOV Department of Information\n      Services,\
    \ State of Washington LA.GOV Bureau of Sanitation, City of\n      Los Angeles\
    \ These entities are strongly encouraged to re-register\n      in the .US domain\
    \ but this is NOT mandatory.  No further state and\n      local agencies will\
    \ be registered under .GOV.\n         Q.  It is not in anyone's best interest\
    \ to name things by\n      organizational boundaries as these things change. Internet\
    \ domain\n      names and host names, once defined and used, become so widely\n\
    \      distributed that they become virtually impossible to change.\n        \
    \ A.  The policy does not require organizations to change their\n      names once\
    \ established, but individual agency policies may.  The\n      DNS system contains\
    \ some capabilities to assist in name transition\n      - the CNAME record provides\
    \ a capability for cross-domain aliases\n      which can be used to ease a transition\
    \ between one name space and\n      another.  As noted in the clarifications,\
    \ naming and sub-domain\n      conventions WITHIN an agency or department DNS\
    \ delegation are\n      solely the province of that entity.\n         Q.  How\
    \ can two entities have the same name registered?  How\n      does this apply\
    \ to NIH.GOV, FDA.GOV, and CDC.GOV, all of which are\n      large components of\
    \ DHHS/PHS?  NCIFCRF.GOV is a component of NIH.\n      Does it have to change?\
    \  I don't understand how a distinction is\n      made if some are grand-fathered\
    \ and some are not.\n        A. US-STATE.GOV and STATE.GOV for example.  The problem\
    \ is\n      actually one entity with two names.  NIH.GOV and FDA.GOV represent\n\
    \      separate entities (albeit within DHHS).  If there were an NIH.GOV\n   \
    \   and an NIH-EAST.GOV for example, NIH would have to eliminate one\n      of\
    \ them (probably moving NIH-EAST.GOV to EAST.NIH.GOV).\n         Q.  How much\
    \ is the taxpayer being asked to spend to alter tens\n      of thousands of existing\
    \ computer and telecommunications systems\n      to support this RFC?\n      \
    \   A. In August 1995 less that half-a-dozen duplicate DNS names at\n      the\
    \ FIPS 95-1 level needed to be changed.  Given the fact that\n      this will\
    \ be accomplished over three years, the costs should be\n      minimal.\n   CROSS-AGENCY\
    \ COLLABORATIONS\n         Q.  An organization maintains a domain name that represents\
    \ a\n      cross-agency community, IC.GOV, which represents members of the\n \
    \     intelligence community.  As a cross-agency collaborative effort,\n     \
    \ does the domain have to be re-registered?\n      A.  The policy states that\
    \ \"Cross-agency collaborative\n      organizations (e.g., \"Federal Networking\
    \ Council\", \"Information\n      Infrastructure Task Force\") are eligible for\
    \ registration under\n      .GOV upon presentation of the chartering document\
    \ and are the only\n      non-listed (in either FIPS 95-1 or the US Government\
    \ Manual)\n      organizations eligible for registration under .GOV.\"  \"IC.GOV\"\
    \n      however, is grand-fathered since it is an existing domain.\n      Nevertheless,\
    \ it would be appropriate to provide a copy of the\n      chartering document\
    \ to the FNC for the record.  This would ease\n      future changes to the IC.GOV\
    \ domain if necessary.\n   FUTURE .GOV REGISTRATIONS\n        Q.Top level domains\
    \ are roughly equivalent to cabinet-level\n      agencies identified in FIPS 95-1.\
    \  What will happen if non-FIPS\n      95-1 entities apply for the \".GOV\" registration\
    \ in the future?\n        A.  The registrar will use this RFC as guidance and\
    \ will not\n      grant the \".GOV\" to any new entity which is not listed in\
    \ the FIPS\n      95-1 or the US Government Manual or which has not been granted\
    \ an\n      exception status by the FNC Executive Committee.\n         Q.  Suppose\
    \ NIH were moved to a new Dept. of Science?  Would\n      our domain name have\
    \ to be changed?\n         A.  NIH.GOV is grand-fathered under the existing policy\
    \ and\n      would not change.  The \"Department of Science\" under its own\n\
    \      policies may require you to re-register though.\n   FNC INTENT\n      \
    \   Q.  It is unclear how this will policy will facilitate access\n      by the\
    \ public to our information, especially since most of the\n      public doesn't\
    \ know our organizational structure or that CDC is\n      part of DHHS/PHS.\n\
    \         A. The policy attempts to avoid confusion as an increasing\n      number\
    \ of entities register under the \".GOV\" domain and to\n      transfer authority\
    \ and responsibility for domain name space to the\n      appropriate agencies\
    \ and away from a centralized authority.  For\n      facilitating access, various\
    \ tools and capabilities are coming\n      into use on the Internet all the time.\
    \  Most of these tools\n      provide a fairly strong search capability which\
    \ should obviate\n      most concerns of finding resources based on domain names.\n\
    \         Q.  Section 1D of this document unfairly constrains the\n      organizations\
    \ within the .GOV domain in stark contrast to Section\n      1F that grants .MIL\
    \ domain organizations full freedom to operate\n      sub-domains in any manner\
    \ chosen.\n         A.  The Federal Networking Council has jurisdiction over the\n\
    \      .GOV domain names; .MIL domain names fall within the jurisdiction\n   \
    \   of the Department of Defense.  The .MIL domain has had a written\n      policy\
    \ delimiting which DOD agencies get registered directly under\n      .MIL since\
    \ about 1987 when the DNS first started to come into use.\n      Individual agencies\
    \ under the .MIL domain (e.g., AF.MIL/US Air\n      Force) are responsible for\
    \ setting policy within their domains and\n      for registrations within those\
    \ domains.  This is exactly\n      equivalent to the .GOV domain - an individual\
    \ agency (e.g.,\n      Treasury.GOV/Dept of Treasury) may and should set policy\
    \ for sub-\n      registrations within their domain.\n         Q.  Section 1B\
    \ identifies several law enforcement agencies as\n      being \"autonomous\" for\
    \ the purposes of domain registration.  What\n      is the selection criteria\
    \ for an \"autonomous law enforcement\"\n      agency?  For instance, the Internal\
    \ Revenue Service (IRS) is\n      responsible for law enforcement as is the Bureau\
    \ of Alcohol,\n      Tobacco, and Firearms (ATF).\n        A.  The selection criteria\
    \ for \"law enforcement agency\" is based\n      on primary mission.  A case could\
    \ be made for either or both of\n      these being law enforcement agencies, although\
    \ the IRS' primary\n      mission is tax revenue collection and has few armed\
    \ officers\n      relative to its size.  An \"autonomous\" agency is one with\
    \ mission\n      and role distinct and (possibly) separate from its containing\n\
    \      department.  Unfortunately, FIPS 95-1 does not do a good job of\n     \
    \ identifying \"autonomous\" entities.  In the event of problems with\n      registration,\
    \ ask the registrar to get a ruling from the\n      registration authority.\n\
    \   ROUTING QUESTIONS\n        Q.  How will Domain Name Service resolution on\
    \ the Internet\n      work?  Instead of a root DNS server returning the address\
    \ of\n      CDC.GOV and immediately directing inquires to our DNS servers,\n \
    \     will the root server return a DNS pointer to DHHS, then DHHS will\n    \
    \  resolve to PHS, then a fourth DNS query to get to CDC?  This will\n      add\
    \ unnecessary traffic to the Net.  (example is the host\n      CDC.PHS.DHHS.GOV)\n\
    \         A.  The answer is based on how you (personally and agency wide)\n  \
    \    configure your servers.  First, most servers cache previous\n      answers\
    \ - they may have to ask once, but generally remember the\n      answer if they\
    \ need it again. Information directly under .GOV will\n      be fairly long-lived\
    \ which substantially reduces the requirement\n      to query .GOV server.  Secondly,\
    \ multiple levels of the DNS tree\n      MAY reside on the same server.  In the\
    \ above example the\n      information for DHHS.GOV, PHS.DHHS.GOV and CDC.PHS.DHHS.GOV\
    \ could\n      all reside on the same server.  Assuming the  location of the\n\
    \      DHHS.GOV server was not cached, it would require two queries.\n      Further\
    \ queries would cache the location of this server and the\n      servers associated\
    \ with the domains it serves.  Lastly, the\n      individual agencies may structure\
    \ their domains as they please.\n      CDC could reside directly under DHHS.GOV\
    \ as CDC.DHHS.GOV subject\n      to HHS's own policies.\n   USING DNS FOR ADVERTISING\
    \ SERVICES\n         Q.  How can agencies utilize domain names for public service\n\
    \      announcements such as regulatory information, health services,\n      etc.?\n\
    \        A.  The use of Domain Names for \"advertising\" is not encouraged,\n\
    \      and there is no empirical data showing that Domain Names are\n      effective\
    \ for such purposes.  Moreover, while it may appear a\n      reasonable assumption,\
    \ we know of no evidence to show that using\n      even commonly know agency,\
    \ program or service names as domain\n      names in fact, facilitates locating\
    \ any particular program or\n      service.  Indeed, we find it as reasonable\
    \ to conclude that, by\n      using freely available search engines, a user could\
    \ locate\n      responsive information before they would successfully \"guess\"\
    \ the\n      appropriate domain name. If the agency CIO deems it advisable to\n\
    \      pursue \"advertising via domain names,\" the agency should use WHOIS\n\
    \      utility (e.g., whois EXAMPLE.COM or whois EXAMPLE.ORG) to\n      determine\
    \ if similar or conflicting names with other domains such\n      as .COM or .ORG\
    \ before proceeding.  Any advertising value may be\n      lost if the same or\
    \ similar names exist within more than one\n      domain.\n   PREVENTING SIMILAR\
    \ NAMES IN OTHER TOP-LEVEL DOMAINS\n         Q:  Our agency spent a lot of time\
    \ coming up with an intuitive\n      domain name and now we find out that the\
    \ same name exists in .COM\n      and .ORG and is confusing to our customers,\
    \ they don't know if it\n      is really our site or not.  How can we prevent\
    \ this use of our\n      domain name?\n         A.  The only practical way is\
    \ to register your name in all\n      available domains and hold them.  We say\
    \ hold (do not use) them\n      for the same reasons that you don't want your\
    \ site spoofed --\n      customer uncertainly as to whether they are in fact at\
    \ a\n      government site.  The implications of Federal agencies using other\n\
    \      than .GOV or FED.US is a policy matter under the statutory\n      authorities\
    \ of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs of\n      the Office of\
    \ Management and Budget.  Agency  CIOs should consult\n      with OMB prior to\
    \ using domain names other than .GOV or .FED.US.\n   THIRD-LEVEL DOMAINS:  CONTACTING\
    \ THE SECOND-LEVEL DOMAIN\n   ADMINISTRATOR.\n         Q. I don't mind having\
    \ a third-level domain registration, but\n      my parent agency does not have\
    \ a second level domain or does not\n      provide third-level registration services.\
    \  What can I do?\n        A.  In the first case, the registration authority can\
    \ usually\n      provide contact information for an appropriate second level\n\
    \      domain.  If not, an exception may be granted by the registration\n    \
    \  authority.  In the second case, make sure that you contact the\n      official\
    \ administrative contact for the second level domain by\n      using the information\
    \ returned by the \"whois\" command, e.g. \"whois\n      STATE.GOV\".  The domain\
    \ administrators have the responsibility of\n      providing third-level registration\
    \ services. If an exception is\n      granted because there is no appropriate\
    \ second level domain, it\n      will only be valid for two years after the subsequent\n\
    \      establishment of an appropriate domain. After that time, the\n      exception\
    \ domain must register in the appropriate second-level\n      domain.\n      \
    \   Q.  What are the implications of using a name that conflicts\n      with a\
    \ .COM or other top-level domain?\n        A.  When requesting exceptions to this\
    \ policy, applicants should\n      consider the limitations of the domain naming\
    \ scheme.  Many common\n      words and terms are already used in .COM, the largest\
    \ TLD at this\n      time, and it may be ineffective to use the same name in .GOV.\n\
    \   US GOVERNMENT MANUAL\n         Q. How can I get the US Government Manual?\n\
    \         A.  Contact Superintendent of Documents\n                P.O. Box 371954\n\
    \                Pittsburgh, PA 15250-7954\n      or see http://www.access/gpo.gov/su_docs\
