- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   The IETF IP Performance Metrics (IPPM) Working Group first\
    \ developed\n   the One-Way Active Measurement Protocol (OWAMP), as specified\
    \ in\n   [RFC4656].  Further protocol development to support testing resulted\n\
    \   in the Two-Way Active Measurement Protocol (TWAMP), as specified in\n   [RFC5357].\n\
    \   Both OWAMP and TWAMP require the implementation of a control and mode\n  \
    \ negotiation protocol (OWAMP-Control and TWAMP-Control) that employs\n   the\
    \ reliable transport services of TCP (including security\n   configuration and\
    \ key derivation).  The control protocols arrange for\n   the configuration and\
    \ management of test sessions using the\n   associated test protocol (OWAMP-Test\
    \ or TWAMP-Test) on UDP transport.\n   The IETF recognizes the value of assigning\
    \ a well-known UDP port to\n   the OWAMP-Test and TWAMP-Test protocols and also\
    \ recognizes that this\n   goal can be easily arranged through port reassignments.\n"

    \ the industry.\n   This memo updates [RFC4656] and [RFC5357], in terms of the\
    \ UDP\n   well-known port assignments.\n"
- title: 4.  Definitions and Background
  contents:
  - "4.  Definitions and Background\n   This section defines key terms and clarifies\
    \ the required composition\n   of the OWAMP and TWAMP Standards Track protocols.\n\
    \   \"OWAMP-Control\" is the protocol defined in Section 3 of [RFC4656].\n   \"\
    OWAMP-Test\" is the protocol defined in Section 4 of [RFC4656].\n   OWAMP is described\
    \ in this direct quote from Section 1.1 of\n   [RFC4656]: \"OWAMP actually consists\
    \ of two inter-related protocols:\n   OWAMP-Control and OWAMP-Test.\"  A similar\
    \ sentence appears in\n   Section 2 of [RFC4656].  For avoidance of doubt, the\
    \ implementation\n   of both OWAMP-Control and OWAMP-Test is REQUIRED for Standards\
    \ Track\n   OWAMP as specified in [RFC4656] (applying the consensus of many\n\
    \   dictionary definitions of \"consist\").\n   \"TWAMP-Control\" is the protocol\
    \ defined in Section 3 of [RFC5357].\n   \"TWAMP-Test\" is the protocol defined\
    \ in Section 4 of [RFC5357].\n   TWAMP is described in this direct quote from\
    \ Section 1.1 of\n   [RFC5357]: \"Similar to OWAMP [RFC4656], TWAMP consists of\
    \ two\n   inter-related protocols: TWAMP-Control and TWAMP-Test.\"  For\n   avoidance\
    \ of doubt, the implementation of both TWAMP-Control and\n   TWAMP-Test is REQUIRED\
    \ for Standards Track TWAMP as specified in\n   [RFC5357] (applying the consensus\
    \ of many dictionary definitions of\n   \"consist\").\n   \"TWAMP Light\" is an\
    \ idea described in Appendix I (\"TWAMP Light\n   (Informative)\") of [RFC5357];\
    \ TWAMP Light includes an unspecified\n   control protocol combined with the TWAMP-Test\
    \ protocol.  In\n   [RFC5357], the TWAMP Light idea was relegated to Appendix\
    \ I because\n   TWAMP Light failed to meet the requirements for IETF protocols\
    \ (there\n   are no specifications for negotiating this form of operation and\
    \ no\n   specifications for mandatory-to-implement security features), as\n  \
    \ described in Appendix A of this memo.  See also [LarsAD] and\n   [TimDISCUSS].\n\
    \   Since the idea of TWAMP Light clearly includes the TWAMP-Test\n   component\
    \ of TWAMP, it is considered reasonable for future systems to\n   use the TWAMP-Test\
    \ well-known UDP port (whose reallocated assignment\n   is specified in this document).\
    \  Clearly, the TWAMP Light idea\n   envisions many components and communication\
    \ capabilities beyond\n   TWAMP-Test (implementing the security requirements,\
    \ for example);\n   otherwise, Appendix I of [RFC5357] would be one sentence long\n\
    \   (equating TWAMP Light with TWAMP-Test only).\n"
- title: 5.  New Well-Known Ports
  contents:
  - "5.  New Well-Known Ports\n   Originally, both TCP and UDP well-known ports were\
    \ assigned to the\n   control protocols that are essential components of Standards\
    \ Track\n   OWAMP and TWAMP.\n   Since OWAMP-Control and TWAMP-Control require\
    \ TCP transport, they\n   cannot make use of the UDP ports that were originally\
    \ assigned.\n   However, test sessions using OWAMP-Test or TWAMP-Test operate\
    \ on UDP\n   transport.\n   Per this memo, IANA has reassigned the UDP well-known\
    \ port from the\n   control protocol to the test protocol (see Section 7 (\"IANA\n\
    \   Considerations\")).  The use of this UDP port is OPTIONAL in Standards\n \
    \  Track OWAMP and TWAMP.  It may simplify some operations to have a\n   well-known\
    \ port available for the test protocols or for future\n   specifications involving\
    \ TWAMP-Test to use this port as a default\n   port.  For example, [TR-390] is\
    \ a specification for testing at the\n   customer edge of IP networks, and conforming\
    \ implementations will\n   benefit from reallocation of the well-known UDP port\
    \ to the test\n   protocol.\n"
- title: 5.1.  Impact on TWAMP-Control Protocol
  contents:
  - "5.1.  Impact on TWAMP-Control Protocol\n   Section 3.5 of [RFC5357] describes\
    \ the detailed process of\n   negotiating the Receiver Port number, on which the\
    \ TWAMP\n   Session-Reflector will send and receive TWAMP-Test packets; see the\n\
    \   quoted text below.  The Control-Client, acting on behalf of the\n   Session-Sender,\
    \ proposes the Receiver Port number from the Dynamic\n   Ports range [RFC6335]:\n\
    \      The Receiver Port is the desired UDP port to which TWAMP-Test\n      packets\
    \ will be sent by the Session-Sender (the port where the\n      Session-Reflector\
    \ is asked to receive test packets).  The Receiver\n      Port is also the UDP\
    \ port from which TWAMP-Test packets will be\n      sent by the Session-Reflector\
    \ (the Session-Reflector will use the\n      same UDP port to send and receive\
    \ packets).\n   It is possible that the proposed Receiver Port may not be available,\n\
    \   e.g., the port is in use by another test session or another\n   application.\
    \  In this case, we update the last paragraph of\n   Section 3.5 of [RFC5357]\
    \ per Erratum ID 1587 (see\n   <https://www.rfc-editor.org/errata/eid1587>) as\
    \ follows:\n      ... the Server at the Session-Reflector MAY suggest an alternate\n\
    \      and available port for this session in the Port field.  The\n      Control-Client\
    \ either accepts the alternate port or composes a new\n      Session-Request message\
    \ with suitable parameters.  Otherwise, the\n      Server uses the Accept field\
    \ to convey other forms of session\n      rejection or failure to the Control-Client\
    \ and MUST NOT suggest an\n      alternate port; in this case, the Port field\
    \ MUST be set to zero.\n   A Control-Client that supports the use of the allocated\
    \ TWAMP-Test\n   Receiver Port (Section 7) MAY request to use that port number\
    \ in the\n   Request-TW-Session command.  If the Server does not support the\n\
    \   allocated TWAMP-Test Receiver Port, then it sends an alternate port\n   number\
    \ in the Accept-Session message with Accept field = 0.  Thus,\n   the deployment\
    \ of the allocated TWAMP Receiver Port number is\n   backward compatible with\
    \ existing TWAMP-Control solutions that are\n   based on [RFC5357].  Of course,\
    \ using a UDP port number chosen from\n   the Dynamic Ports range [RFC6335] will\
    \ help avoid the situation where\n   the Control-Client or Server finds that the\
    \ proposed port is already\n   in use.\n"
- title: 5.2.  Impact on OWAMP-Control Protocol
  contents:
  - "5.2.  Impact on OWAMP-Control Protocol\n   As described above, an OWAMP-Control\
    \ client that supports the use of\n   the allocated OWAMP-Test Receiver Port (Section\
    \ 7) MAY request to use\n   that port number in the Request-Session command. \
    \ If the Server does\n   not support the allocated OWAMP-Test Receiver Port (or\
    \ does not have\n   the port available), then it sends an alternate port number\
    \ in the\n   Accept-Session message with Accept field = 0.  Further exchanges\n\
    \   proceed as already specified.\n"
- title: 5.3.  Impact on OWAMP-Test/TWAMP-Test Protocols
  contents:
  - "5.3.  Impact on OWAMP-Test/TWAMP-Test Protocols\n   OWAMP-Test/TWAMP-Test may\
    \ be used to measure IP performance metrics\n   in an Equal-Cost Multipath (ECMP)\
    \ environment.  Though algorithms to\n   balance IP flows among available paths\
    \ have not been standardized,\n   the most common is the five-tuple that uses\
    \ destination IP address,\n   source IP address, protocol type, destination port\
    \ number, and source\n   port number.  When attempting to monitor different paths\
    \ in an ECMP\n   network, it is sufficient to vary only one of five parameters,\
    \ e.g.,\n   the source port number.  Thus, there will be no negative impact on\n\
    \   the ability to arrange concurrent OWAMP/TWAMP test sessions between\n   the\
    \ same test points to monitor different paths in the ECMP network\n   when using\
    \ the reallocated UDP port number as the Receiver Port, as\n   using the port\
    \ is optional.\n"
- title: 6.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "6.  Security Considerations\n   The security considerations that apply to any\
    \ active measurement of\n   live paths are relevant here as well (see [RFC4656]\
    \ and [RFC5357]).\n   When considering the privacy of those involved in measurement\
    \ or\n   those whose traffic is measured, the sensitive information available\n\
    \   to potential observers is greatly reduced when using active\n   techniques\
    \ that are within this scope of work.  Passive observations\n   of user traffic\
    \ for measurement purposes raise many privacy issues.\n   We refer the reader\
    \ to the security and privacy considerations\n   described in the Large-Scale\
    \ Measurement of Broadband Performance\n   (LMAP) framework [RFC7594], which covers\
    \ both active and passive\n   techniques.\n   The registered UDP port as the Receiver\
    \ Port for OWAMP-Test/\n   TWAMP-Test could become a target of denial of service\
    \ (DoS) or could\n   be used to aid man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks.  To improve\n\
    \   protection against DoS, the following methods are recommended:\n   o  filtering\
    \ access to the OWAMP/TWAMP Receiver Port via an\n      access list.\n   o  using\
    \ a non-globally routable IP address for the OWAMP/TWAMP\n      Session-Reflector\
    \ address.\n   A MITM attacker may try to modify the contents of the OWAMP-Test/\n\
    \   TWAMP-Test packets in order to alter the measurement results.\n   However,\
    \ an implementation can use authenticated mode to detect\n   modification of data.\
    \  In addition, an implementation can use\n   encrypted mode to prevent eavesdropping\
    \ and undetected modification\n   of the OWAMP-Test/TWAMP-Test packets.\n   There\
    \ is also the risk of a network under test giving special\n   treatment to flows\
    \ involving the well-known UDP port, with or without\n   knowing source and destination\
    \ addresses of measurement systems, and\n   thus biasing the results through preferential\
    \ or detrimental\n   processing.\n"

    \  points out that TWAMP Light was an incomplete specification\n      because\
    \ the key required for authenticated and encrypted modes\n      depended on the\
    \ TWAMP-Control Session key.  Additional requirement\n      statements were added\
    \ in Appendix I to address Tim's Ballot\n      discuss (see the last three paragraphs\
    \ of Appendix I in\n      [RFC5357]).\n   Since the idea of TWAMP Light clearly\
    \ includes the TWAMP-Test\n   protocol and other undefined facilities, Appendix\
    \ I of [RFC5357]\n   simply describes ideas for how TWAMP-Test might be used outside\
    \ of\n   the context of Standards Track TWAMP.\n"
