  - "1.  Introduction\n   This document defines basic IPv6 features for a residential\
    \ or small-\n   office router, referred to as an IPv6 CE router.  Typically, these\n\
    \   routers also support IPv4.\n   Mixed environments of dual-stack hosts and\
    \ IPv6-only hosts (behind\n   the CE router) can be more complex if the IPv6-only\
    \ devices are using\n   a translator to access IPv4 servers [RFC6144].  Support\
    \ for such\n   mixed environments is not in scope of this document.\n   This document\
    \ specifies how an IPv6 CE router automatically\n   provisions its WAN interface,\
    \ acquires address space for provisioning\n   of its LAN interfaces, and fetches\
    \ other configuration information\n   from the service provider network.  Automatic\
    \ provisioning of more\n   complex topology than a single router with multiple\
    \ LAN interfaces is\n   out of scope for this document.\n   See [RFC4779] for\
    \ a discussion of options available for deploying\n   IPv6 in service provider\
    \ access networks.\n"

  - "3.1.  Current IPv4 End-User Network Architecture\n   An end-user network will\
    \ likely support both IPv4 and IPv6.  It is\n   not expected that an end-user\
    \ will change their existing network\n   topology with the introduction of IPv6.\
    \  There are some differences\n   in how IPv6 works and is provisioned; these\
    \ differences have\n   implications for the network architecture.  A typical IPv4\
    \ end-user\n   network consists of a \"plug and play\" router with NAT functionality\n\
    \   and a single link behind it, connected to the service provider\n   network.\n\
    \   A typical IPv4 NAT deployment by default blocks all incoming\n   connections.\
    \  Opening of ports is typically allowed using a Universal\n   Plug and Play Internet\
    \ Gateway Device (UPnP IGD) [UPnP-IGD] or some\n   other firewall control protocol.\n\
    \   Another consequence of using private address space in the end-user\n   network\
    \ is that it provides stable addressing; i.e., it never changes\n   even when\
    \ you change service providers, and the addresses are always\n   there even when\
    \ the WAN interface is down or the customer edge router\n   has not yet been provisioned.\n\
    \   Rewriting addresses on the edge of the network also allows for some\n   rudimentary\
    \ multihoming, even though using NATs for multihoming does\n   not preserve connections\
    \ during a fail-over event [RFC4864].\n   Many existing routers support dynamic\
    \ routing, and advanced end-users\n   can build arbitrary, complex networks using\
    \ manual configuration of\n   address prefixes combined with a dynamic routing\

- title: 3.2.1.  Local Communication
  contents:
  - "3.2.1.  Local Communication\n   Link-local IPv6 addresses are used by hosts communicating\
    \ on a single\n   link.  Unique Local IPv6 Unicast Addresses (ULAs) [RFC4193]\
    \ are used\n   by hosts communicating within the end-user network across multiple\n\
    \   links, but without requiring the application to use a globally\n   routable\
    \ address.  The IPv6 CE router defaults to acting as the\n   demarcation point\
    \ between two networks by providing a ULA boundary, a\n   multicast zone boundary,\
    \ and ingress and egress traffic filters.\n   A dual-stack host is multihomed\
    \ to IPv4 and IPv6 networks.  The IPv4\n   and IPv6 topologies may not be congruent,\
    \ and different addresses may\n   have different reachability, e.g., ULAs.  A\
    \ host stack has to be able\n   to quickly fail over and try a different source\
    \ address and\n   destination address pair if communication fails, as outlined\
    \ in\n   [HAPPY-EYEBALLS].\n   At the time of this writing, several host implementations\
    \ do not\n   handle the case where they have an IPv6 address configured and no\n\
    \   IPv6 connectivity, either because the address itself has a limited\n   topological\
    \ reachability (e.g., ULA) or because the IPv6 CE router is\n   not connected\
    \ to the IPv6 network on its WAN interface.  To support\n   host implementations\
    \ that do not handle multihoming in a multi-prefix\n   environment [MULTIHOMING-WITHOUT-NAT],\
    \ the IPv6 CE router should not,\n   as detailed in the requirements below, advertise\
    \ itself as a default\n   router on the LAN interface(s) when it does not have\
    \ IPv6\n   connectivity on the WAN interface or when it is not provisioned with\n\
    \   IPv6 addresses.  For local IPv6 communication, the mechanisms\n   specified\
    \ in [RFC4191] are used.\n   ULA addressing is useful where the IPv6 CE router\
    \ has multiple LAN\n   interfaces with hosts that need to communicate with each\
    \ other.  If\n   the IPv6 CE router has only a single LAN interface (IPv6 link),\
    \ then\n   link-local addressing can be used instead.\n   In the event that more\
    \ than one IPv6 CE router is present on the LAN,\n   then coexistence with IPv4\
    \ requires all of them to conform to these\n   recommendations, especially requirements\
    \ ULA-5 and L-4 below.\n"

    \ small to address all of its\n           interfaces, the IPv6 CE router SHOULD\
    \ log a system management\n           error.\n   WPD-4:  The IPv6 CE router MUST\

    \ If the IPv6 CE router initiates DHCPv6 before receiving a\n           Router\

    \ packets that match the aggregate route(s), but not\n           any of the more-specific\
    \ routes.  In other words, the next\n           hop for the aggregate route(s)\
    \ should be the null\n           destination.  This is necessary to prevent forwarding\
    \ loops\n           when some addresses covered by the aggregate are not\n   \
    \        reachable [RFC4632].\n           (a)  The IPv6 CE router SHOULD send\
    \ an ICMPv6 Destination\n                Unreachable message in accordance with\
    \ Section 3.1 of\n                [RFC4443] back to the source of the packet,\

  - "4.3.  LAN-Side Configuration\n   The IPv6 CE router distributes configuration\
    \ information obtained\n   during WAN interface provisioning to IPv6 hosts and\
    \ assists IPv6\n   hosts in obtaining IPv6 addresses.  It also supports connectivity\
    \ of\n   these devices in the absence of any working WAN interface.\n   An IPv6\
    \ CE router is expected to support an IPv6 end-user network and\n   IPv6 hosts\
    \ that exhibit the following characteristics:\n   1.  Link-local addresses may\
    \ be insufficient for allowing IPv6\n       applications to communicate with each\
    \ other in the end-user\n       network.  The IPv6 CE router will need to enable\
    \ this\n       communication by providing globally scoped unicast addresses or\n\
    \       ULAs [RFC4193], whether or not WAN connectivity exists.\n   2.  IPv6 hosts\
    \ should be capable of using SLAAC and may be capable of\n       using DHCPv6\
    \ for acquiring their addresses.\n   3.  IPv6 hosts may use DHCPv6 for other configuration\
    \ information,\n       such as the DNS_SERVERS option for acquiring DNS information.\n\
    \   Unless otherwise specified, the following requirements apply to the\n   IPv6\
    \ CE router's LAN interfaces only.\n   ULA requirements:\n   ULA-1:  The IPv6\
    \ CE router SHOULD be capable of generating a ULA\n           prefix [RFC4193].\n\
    \   ULA-2:  An IPv6 CE router with a ULA prefix MUST maintain this prefix\n  \
    \         consistently across reboots.\n   ULA-3:  The value of the ULA prefix\
    \ SHOULD be user-configurable.\n   ULA-4:  By default, the IPv6 CE router MUST\
    \ act as a site border\n           router according to Section 4.3 of [RFC4193]\
    \ and filter\n           packets with local IPv6 source or destination addresses\n\
    \           accordingly.\n   ULA-5:  An IPv6 CE router MUST NOT advertise itself\
    \ as a default\n           router with a Router Lifetime greater than zero whenever\
    \ all\n           of its configured and delegated prefixes are ULA prefixes.\n\
    \   LAN requirements:\n   L-1:   The IPv6 CE router MUST support router behavior\
    \ according to\n          Neighbor Discovery for IPv6 [RFC4861].\n   L-2:   The\
    \ IPv6 CE router MUST assign a separate /64 from its\n          delegated prefix(es)\
    \ (and ULA prefix if configured to provide\n          ULA addressing) for each\
    \ of its LAN interfaces.\n   L-3:   An IPv6 CE router MUST advertise itself as\
    \ a router for the\n          delegated prefix(es) (and ULA prefix if configured\
    \ to provide\n          ULA addressing) using the \"Route Information Option\"\
    \ specified\n          in Section 2.3 of [RFC4191].  This advertisement is\n \
    \         independent of having or not having IPv6 connectivity on the\n     \
    \     WAN interface.\n   L-4:   An IPv6 CE router MUST NOT advertise itself as\
    \ a default\n          router with a Router Lifetime [RFC4861] greater than zero\
    \ if\n          it has no prefixes configured or delegated to it.\n   L-5:   The\
    \ IPv6 CE router MUST make each LAN interface an advertising\n          interface\
    \ according to [RFC4861].\n   L-6:   In Router Advertisement messages, the Prefix\
    \ Information\n          option's A and L flags MUST be set to 1 by default.\n\
    \   L-7:   The A and L flags' settings SHOULD be user-configurable.\n   L-8: \
    \  The IPv6 CE router MUST support a DHCPv6 server capable of\n          IPv6\
    \ address assignment according to [RFC3315] OR a stateless\n          DHCPv6 server\
    \ according to [RFC3736] on its LAN interfaces.\n   L-9:   Unless the IPv6 CE\
    \ router is configured to support the DHCPv6\n          IA_NA option, it SHOULD\
    \ set the M flag to 0 and the O flag to\n          1 in its Router Advertisement\
    \ messages [RFC4861].\n   L-10:  The IPv6 CE router MUST support providing DNS\
    \ information in\n          the DHCPv6 DNS_SERVERS and DOMAIN_LIST options [RFC3646].\n\
    \   L-11:  The IPv6 CE router SHOULD support providing DNS information in\n  \
    \        the Router Advertisement Recursive DNS Server (RDNSS) and DNS\n     \
    \     Search List (DNSSL) options as specified in [RFC6106].\n   L-12:  The IPv6\
    \ CE router SHOULD make available a subset of DHCPv6\n          options (as listed\
    \ in Section 5.3 of [RFC3736]) received from\n          the DHCPv6 client on its\
    \ WAN interface to its LAN-side DHCPv6\n          server.\n   L-13:  If the delegated\
    \ prefix changes, i.e., the current prefix is\n          replaced with a new prefix\
    \ without any overlapping time\n          period, then the IPv6 CE router MUST\
    \ immediately advertise the\n          old prefix with a Preferred Lifetime of\
    \ zero and a Valid\n          Lifetime of the lower of the current Valid Lifetime\
    \ and 2\n          hours (which must be decremented in real time) in a Router\n\
    \          Advertisement message as described in Section 5.5.3, (e) of\n     \
    \     [RFC4862].\n   L-14:  The IPv6 CE router MUST send an ICMP Destination Unreachable\n\
    \          message, code 5 (Source address failed ingress/egress policy)\n   \
    \       for packets forwarded to it that use an address from a prefix\n      \
    \    that has been deprecated.\n"
- title: 4.4.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "4.4.  Security Considerations\n   It is considered a best practice to filter\
    \ obviously malicious\n   traffic (e.g., spoofed packets, \"Martian\" addresses,\
    \ etc.).  Thus,\n   the IPv6 CE router ought to support basic stateless egress\
    \ and\n   ingress filters.  The CE router is also expected to offer mechanisms\n\
    \   to filter traffic entering the customer network; however, the method\n   by\
    \ which vendors implement configurable packet filtering is beyond\n   the scope\
    \ of this document.\n   Security requirements:\n   S-1:  The IPv6 CE router SHOULD\
    \ support [RFC6092].  In particular,\n         the IPv6 CE router SHOULD support\
    \ functionality sufficient for\n         implementing the set of recommendations\
    \ in [RFC6092],\n         Section 4.  This document takes no position on whether\
    \ such\n         functionality is enabled by default or mechanisms by which\n\
    \         users would configure it.\n   S-2:  The IPv6 CE router MUST support\
    \ ingress filtering in accordance\n         with BCP 38 [RFC2827].\n"
