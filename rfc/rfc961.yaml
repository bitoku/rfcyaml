  - "INTRODUCTION\n   This RFC identifies the documents specifying the official protocols\n\
    \   used in the Internet.  Comments indicate any revisions or changes\n   planned.\n\
    \   To first order, the official protocols are those in the \"Internet\n   Protocol\
    \ Transition Workbook\" (IPTW) dated March 1982.  There are\n   several protocols\
    \ in use that are not in the IPTW.  A few of the\n   protocols in the IPTW have\
    \ been revised.  Notably, the mail protocols\n   have been revised and issued\
    \ as a volume titled \"Internet Mail\n   Protocols\" dated November 1982.  Telnet\
    \ and the most useful Telnet\n   options have been revised and issued as a volume\
    \ titled \"Internet\n   Telnet Protocol and Options\" (ITP) dated June 1983. \
    \ The File\n   Transfer Protocol has been revised most recently as RFC 959 which\
    \ is\n   not yet included in any collection.  Some protocols have not been\n \
    \  revised for many years, these are found in the old \"ARPANET Protocol\n   Handbook\"\
    \ (APH) dated January 1978.  There is also a volume of\n   protocol related information\
    \ called the \"Internet Protocol\n   Implementers Guide\" (IPIG) dated August\
    \ 1982.\n   This document is organized as a sketchy outline.  The entries are\n\
    \   protocols (e.g., Transmission Control Protocol).  In each entry there\n  \
    \ are notes on status, specification, comments, other references,\n   dependencies,\
    \ and contact.\n      The STATUS is one of: required, recommended, elective, or\n\
    \      experimental.\n      The SPECIFICATION identifies the protocol defining\
    \ documents.\n      The COMMENTS describe any differences from the specification\
    \ or\n      problems with the protocol.\n      The OTHER REFERENCES identify documents\
    \ that comment on or expand\n      on the protocol.\n"

    \   COMMENTS:\n         This is the universal protocol of the Internet.  This\
    \ datagram\n         protocol provides the universal addressing of hosts in the\n\
    \         Internet.\n         A few minor problems have been noted in this document.\n\
    \         The most serious is a bit of confusion in the route options.\n     \
    \    The route options have a pointer that indicates which octet of\n        \
    \ the route is the next to be used.  The confusion is between the\n         phrases\
    \ \"the pointer is relative to this option\" and \"the\n         smallest legal\
    \ value for the pointer is 4\".  If you are\n         confused, forget about the\
    \ relative part, the pointer begins\n         at 4.\n         Another important\
    \ point is the alternate reassembly procedure\n         suggested in RFC 815.\n\
    \         Some changes are in the works for the security option.\n         Note\
    \ that ICMP is defined to be an integral part of IP.  You\n         have not completed\

    \       Event Processing Section:  There are many minor corrections and\n    \
    \     clarifications needed in this section.\n         Push:  There are still\
    \ some phrases in the document that give a\n         \"record mark\" flavor to\
    \ the push.  These should be further\n         clarified.  The push is not a record\
    \ mark.\n         Urgent:  Page 17 is wrong.  The urgent pointer points to the\n\
    \         last octet of urgent data (not to the first octet of non-urgent\n  \

    \       Listening Servers:  Several comments have been received on\n         difficulties\
    \ with contacting listening servers.  There should\n         be some discussion\
    \ of implementation issues for servers, and\n         some notes on alternative\
    \ models of system and process\n         organization for servers.\n         Maximum\
    \ Segment Size:  The maximum segment size option should\n         be generalized\
    \ and clarified.  It can be used to either\n         increase or decrease the\
    \ maximum segment size from the default.\n         The TCP Maximum Segment Size\
    \ is the IP Maximum Datagram Size\n         minus forty.  The default IP Maximum\
    \ Datagram Size is 576.  The\n         default TCP Maximum Segment Size is 536.\
    \  For further\n         discussion, see RFC 879.\n         Idle Connections:\
    \  There have been questions about\n         automatically closing idle connections.\
    \  Idle connections are\n         ok, and should not be closed.  There are several\
    \ cases where\n         idle connections arise, for example, in Telnet when a\
    \ user is\n         thinking for a long time following a message from the server\n\
    \         computer before his next input.  There is no TCP \"probe\"\n       \
    \  mechanism, and none is needed.\n         Queued Receive Data on Closing:  There\
    \ are several points where\n         it is not clear from the description what\
    \ to do about data\n         received by the TCP but not yet passed to the user,\n\
    \         particularly when the connection is being closed.  In general,\n   \
    \      the data is to be kept to give to the user if he does a RECV\n        \
    \ call.\n         Out of Order Segments:  The description says that segments that\n\
    \         arrive out of order, that is, are not exactly the next segment\n   \
    \      to be processed, may be kept on hand.  It should also point out\n     \
    \    that there is a very large performance penalty for not doing\n         so.\n\
    \         User Time Out:  This is the time out started on an open or send\n  \
    \       call.  If this user time out occurs the user should be\n         notified,\
    \ but the connection should not be closed or the TCB\n         deleted.  The user\
    \ should explicitly ABORT the connection if he\n         wants to give up.\n \
