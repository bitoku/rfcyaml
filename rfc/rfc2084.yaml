- title: Abstract
  contents:
  - "Abstract\n   This document specifies the requirements for the provision of\n\
    \   security services to the HyperText Transport Protocol.  These\n   services\
    \ include confidentiality, integrity, user authentication, and\n   authentication\
    \ of servers/services, including proxied or gatewayed\n   services.  Such services\
    \ may be provided as extensions to HTTP, or as\n   an encapsulating security protocol.\
    \  Secondary requirements include\n   ease of integration and support of multiple\
    \ mechanisms for providing\n   these services.\n"
- title: 1. Introduction
  contents:
  - "1. Introduction\n   The use of the HyperText Transport Protocol [1] to provide\n\
    \   specialized or commercial services and personal or private data\n   necessitates\
    \ the development of secure versions that include privacy\n   and authentication\
    \ services.  Such services may be provided as\n   extensions to HTTP, or as encapsulating\
    \ security protocols; for the\n   purposes of this document, all such enhancements\
    \ will be referred to\n   as WTS.\n   In this document, we specify the requirements\
    \ for WTS, with the\n   intent of codifying perceived Internet-wide needs, along\
    \ with\n   existing practice, in a way that aids in the evaluation and\n   development\
    \ of such protocols.\n   WTS is an enhancement to an object transport protocol.\
    \  As such, it\n   does not provide independent certification of documents or\
    \ other data\n   objects outside of the scope of the transfer of said objects.\
    \  In\n   addition, security at the WTS layer is independent of and orthogonal\n\
    \   to security services provided at underlying network layers.  It is\n   envisioned\
    \ that WTS may coexist in a single transaction with such\n   mechanisms, each\
    \ providing security services at the appropriate\n   level, with at worst some\
    \ redundancy of service.\n"
- title: 1.1 Terminology
  contents:
  - "1.1 Terminology\n   This following terms have specific meaning in the context\
    \ of this\n   document.  The HTTP specification [1] defines additional useful\n\
    \   terms.\n   Transaction:\n      A complete HTTP action, consisting of a request\
    \ from the\n      client and a response from the server.\n   Gatewayed Service:\n\
    \      A service accessed, via HTTP or an alternate protocol, by the\n      HTTP\
    \ server on behalf of the client.\n   Mechanism:\n      An specific implementation\
    \ of a protocol or related subset of\n      features of a protocol.\n"
- title: 2. General Requirements
  contents:
  - "2. General Requirements\n   WTS must define the following services.  These services\
    \ must be\n   provided independently of each other and support the needs of proxies\n\
    \   and intermediaries\n    o Confidentiality of the HTTP request and/or response.\n\
    \    o Data origin authentication and data integrity of the HTTP request\n   \
    \   and/or response.\n    o Non-repudiability of origin for the request and/or\
    \ response.\n    o Transmission freshness of request and/or response.\n    o Ease\
    \ of integration with other features of HTTP.\n    o Support of multiple mechanisms\
    \ for the above services.\n"
- title: 3. Confidentiality
  contents:
  - "3. Confidentiality\n   WTS must be able to provide confidentiality for both requests\
    \ and\n   responses.  Note: because the identity of the object being requested\n\
    \   is potentially sensitive, the URI of the request should be\n   confidential;\
    \ this is particularly critical in the common case of\n   form data or other user\
    \ input being passed in the URI.\n"
- title: 4. Service Authentication
  contents:
  - "4. Service Authentication\n   WTS should support the authentication of gatewayed\
    \ services to the\n   client.\n   WTS should support the authentication of the\
    \ origin HTTP server or\n   gatewayed services regardless of intermediary proxy\
    \ or caching\n   servers.\n   To allow user privacy, WTS must support service\
    \ authentication with\n   user anonymity.\n   Because the identity of the object\
    \ being requested is potentially\n   sensitive, service authentication should\
    \ occur before any part of the\n   request, including the URI of the requested\
    \ object, is passed.  In\n   cases where the authentication process depends on\
    \ the URI (or other\n   header data) of the request, such as gatewayed services,\
    \ the minimum\n   necessary information to identify the entity to be authenticated\n\
    \   should be passed.\n"
- title: 5. User Authentication
  contents:
  - "5. User Authentication\n   WTS must support the authentication of the client\
    \ to the server.\n   WTS should support the authentication of the client to gatewayed\n\
    \   services.\n   WTS should support the authentication of the client to the origin\n\
    \   HTTP server regardless of intermediary proxy servers.\n"
- title: 6. Integrity
  contents:
  - "6. Integrity\n   WTS must provide assurance of the integrity of the HTTP transaction,\n\
    \   including the HTTP headers and data objects of both client requests\n   and\
    \ server responses.\n"
- title: 7. Integration
  contents:
  - "7. Integration\n   In order to support integration with current and future versions\
    \ of\n   HTTP, and to provide extendibility and independence of development,\n\
    \   the secure services provided by WTS must be orthogonal to and\n   independent\
    \ of other services provided by HTTP.\n   In accordance with the layered model\
    \ of network protocols, WTS must\n   be:\n    o independent of the content or\
    \ nature of data objects being\n      transported although special attention to\
    \ reference integrity of\n      hyperlinked objects may be appropriate\n    o\
    \ implementable over a variety of connection schemes and\n      underlying transport\
    \ protocols\n"
- title: 8. Multiple Mechanisms
  contents:
  - "8. Multiple Mechanisms\n   WTS must be compatible with multiple mechanisms for\
    \ authentication\n   and encryption.  Support for multiple mechanisms is required\
    \ for a\n   number of reasons:\n    o Accommodation of variations in site policies,\
    \ including those\n      due to external restrictions on the availability of\n\
    \      cryptographic technologies.\n    o Support for a variety of applications\
    \ and gatewayed services.\n    o Support for parallel implementations within and\
    \ across\n      administrative domains.\n    o Accomodation of application-specific\
    \ performance/security\n      tradeoffs.\n   To allow interoperability across\
    \ domains, and to support the\n   transition to new/upgraded mechanisms, WTS should\
    \ provide negotiation\n   of authentication and encryption mechanisms.\n"
