  - "Protocol Document Order Information\n   How to get the Protocol Handbook - 1985:\n\
    \      It has been about 5 years since the release of the Internet\n      Protocol\
    \ Transition Workbook (IPTW) and the related documents\n      which were issued\
    \ as a document set for implementors of TCP/IP and\n      related application\
    \ protocols.  These were issued to assist the\n      NCP-to-TCP transition which\
    \ took place in early 1983.  Since that\n      time the network has undergone\
    \ many changes, the most noteable\n      being the creation of the Defense Data\
    \ Network (DDN) and the\n      ARPANET/MILNET split, leaving the ARPANET as a\
    \ research and\n      development network, and MILNET as an operational military\n\
    \      network.\n      An updated and much expanded version of the IPTW is needed\
    \ to\n      reflect these changes, and the 1985 DDN Protocol Handbook is a\n \
    \     response to this need.  The cost is $110 domestic, and $130\n      foreign,\
    \ including 4th class postage (check, money order, or\n      purchase order accepted).\n\
    \      The 1985 DDN Protocol Handbook is divided into three volumes:\n       \
    \  1.  The first volume includes Military Standard (MIL STD)\n         protocols\
    \ as well as administrative guidelines pertaining to\n         the MILNET portion\
    \ of the DDN.\n         2.  The second volume includes the DARPA Internet protocols\
    \ as\n         well as administrative guidelines pertaining to the ARPANET\n \
    \        portion of the DDN.  Most of these protocols have also been\n       \
    \  issued as RFCs.\n         3.  The third volume contains several background\
    \ articles,\n         implementation guidelines, and additional protocol\n   \
    \      specifications.  This volume is relevant to both portions of\n        \
    \ the network, and should be used in conjunction with the other\n         two\
    \ volumes.\n         The Table of Contents of the three volumes is given in\n\
    \         Appendix A.\n"
