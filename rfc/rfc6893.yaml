- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   The Open IPTV Forum (OIPF) is a pan-industry initiative\
    \ with the\n   purpose of producing end-to-end specifications for IPTV that will\n\
    \   take the next generation of IPTV into the mass market.  The Forum,\n   which\
    \ is fully open to participation from the communications,\n   entertainment, and\
    \ other relevant industries, will focus on the\n   development of specifications\
    \ that will help streamline and\n   accelerate deployments of IPTV technologies\
    \ and will maximize the\n   benefits of IPTV for consumers, network operators,\
    \ content providers,\n   service providers, consumer electronics manufacturers,\
    \ and home and\n   network infrastructure providers.\n   The main objective of\
    \ the Open IPTV Forum is to produce end-to-end\n   specifications for IPTV including:\n\
    \      o  Architecture and interfaces\n      o  Network and terminal functionality\n\
    \      o  Interactive and personalized services\n      o  Technology choices for\
    \ all major functionalities\n      o  A common UNI (User-Network Interface) for\
    \ the Open Internet and\n         Managed Networks\n      o  Certification of\
    \ equipment, including end user devices and\n         service provider offerings\n\
    \   The end-to-end specifications support:\n      o  A variety of IPTV and Internet\
    \ multimedia services\n      o  Managed networks and the Open Internet\n     \
    \ o  Integration with communication services\n      o  Convergence of IPTV and\
    \ multimedia services across different\n         access technologies\n      o\
    \  Easy integration of third-party content offerings\n      o  Authentication\
    \ and content protection\n      o  Various devices in the home network\n   The\
    \ OIPF is basing its end-to-end IPTV specifications on relevant\n   standards\
    \ produced by other bodies and is collaborating with them to\n   encourage convergence\
    \ where appropriate and address any shortcomings\n   or gaps.\n   In the creation\
    \ of the end-to-end IPTV specification, some new\n   resources need to be defined.\n\
    \   The OIPF would like to assign unique, permanent, location-independent\n  \
    \ names based on URNs for some resources it produces or manages.  These\n   URNs\
    \ will be constructed according to the URN syntax defined in\n   [RFC2141].\n\
    \   This namespace specification is for a formal namespace to be\n   registered\
    \ according to the procedures set forth in [RFC3406].\n"
- title: 2.  URN Specification for the OIPF Namespace Identifier (NID)
  contents:
  - "2.  URN Specification for the OIPF Namespace Identifier (NID)\n   This section\
    \ provides the information required to register a formal\n   namespace according\
    \ to the registration procedure defined in\n   [RFC3406].  The URNs conform to\
    \ the syntax defined in [RFC2141].\n   Namespace ID:\n      \"oipf\"\n   Registration\

    \ structure:\n      URNs assigned by the OIPF will have the following structure\
    \ based\n      on the organizational structure of the resources specified in the\n\
    \      OIPF IPTV Solution specifications:\n         urn:oipf:<NSS>\n      where\
    \ the syntax of \"<NSS>\" is specified in Section 2.2 of the URN\n      Syntax\
    \ requirements ([RFC2141]).\n      The individual URNs will be assigned by the\
    \ OIPF through the\n      process of development of OIPF specifications.\n   Relevant\
    \ ancillary documentation:\n      None.\n   Identifier uniqueness considerations:\n\
    \      The OIPF will establish unique identifiers as appropriate and will\n  \
    \    ensure that an assigned string is never reassigned.\n   Identifier persistence\
    \ considerations:\n      The OIPF is committed to maintaining the accessibility\
    \ and\n      persistence of all resources that are officially assigned URNs by\n\
    \      the organization.  The registration tables and information will be\n  \
    \    published and maintained by the OIPF on its website.\n   Process of identifier\
    \ assignment:\n      The assignment of identifiers is fully controlled and managed\
    \ by\n      the OIPF.\n   Process of identifier resolution:\n      Not applicable;\
    \ the \"oipf\" namespace is not listed with a\n      Resolution Discovery System.\n\
    \   Rules for Lexical Equivalence:\n      The \"<NSS>\" is case-insensitive.\n\
    \   Conformance with URN Syntax:\n      No special considerations.\n   Validation\
    \ mechanism:\n      None specified.  URN assignment will be managed completely\
    \ and\n      published by the OIPF.\n   Scope:\n      Global\n"

- title: 4.  Namespace Considerations
  contents:
  - "4.  Namespace Considerations\n   A unique formal namespace is required by the\
    \ OIPF in order to specify\n   how the various existing standards can be linked\
    \ in order to create a\n   true end-to-end ecosystem for standards-based IPTV\
    \ deployments and to\n   provide the necessary system-wide resources.\n   URN\
    \ assignment procedures:\n      The individual URNs shall be assigned through\
    \ the process of\n      development of OIPF specifications by the Open IPTV Forum\
    \ (OIPF)\n      e.V.  The latest information about OIPF-defined specifications\
    \ can\n      always be found at the owner's website at\n         <http://www.oipf.tv/specifications>\n\
    \   URN resolution/delegation:\n      The resolution and delegation shall be determined\
    \ through the\n      process of development of specifications by the Open IPTV\
    \ Forum.\n      Since the implementations envisaged cover a wide range of devices\n\
    \      with quite different access methods and capabilities, no single\n     \
    \ resolution or delegation mechanism can be referenced in this\n      document.\n\
    \   Types of resources to be identified:\n      Types of resources to be identified\
    \ include XML schema definition\n      files, classification schemes, and identification\
    \ systems defined\n      and published by the OIPF.  These resources being identified\n\
    \      constitute a metadata system to describe digital multimedia\n      broadcast\
    \ services or content conveyed as part of such services.\n      The latest OIPF-defined\
    \ specifications can always be found at\n         <http://www.oipf.tv/specifications>\n"
- title: 5.  Community Considerations
  contents:
  - "5.  Community Considerations\n   URNs defined by the OIPF will be used by implementers\
    \ of IPTV\n   systems, services, products, and applications based on the OIPF\
    \ IPTV\n   Solution specification.  They are an essential component of the open\n\
    \   IPTV ecosystem that is being facilitated by the OIPF.\n"
- title: 6.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "6.  Security Considerations\n   There are no additional security considerations\
    \ other than those\n   normally associated with the use and resolution of URNs\
    \ in general,\n   which are described in [RFC1737], [RFC2141], and [RFC3406].\n\
    \   This document registers a namespace for URNs.  OIPF may assign\n   special\
    \ meaning to certain characters of the Namespace Specific\n   String (NSS) in\
    \ its specifications.  Any security considerations\n   resulting from such an\
    \ assignment is outside the scope of this\n   document.\n"
