Abstract This document specifies Real time Transport Protocol (RTP) payload formats to be used for the Enhanced Variable Rate Wideband Codec (EVRC WB) and updates the media type registrations for EVRC B codec.
Several media type registrations are included for EVRC WB RTP payload formats.
In addition, a file format is specified for transport of EVRC WB speech data in storage mode applications such as email.
This document specifies the payload formats for packetization of EVRC WB encoded speech signals into the Real time Transport Protocol (RTP).
It defines support for the header free, interleaved/bundled, and compact bundle packet formats for the EVRC WB codec as well as discontinuous transmission
(DTX) support for EVRC WB encoded speech transported via RTP.
The EVRC WB codec offers better speech quality than the EVRC and EVRC B codecs.
EVRC WB belongs to the EVRC family of codecs.
This document also updates the media type registrations for the EVRC B codec.
The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [1].
Background EVRC WB is a wideband extension of the EVRC B [4] speech codec developed in the Third Generation Partnership Project 2 (3GPP2) with support for discontinuous transmission (DTX).
It provides enhanced (wideband) voice quality.
The EVRC WB codec operates on 20 ms frames, and the default sampling rate is 16 kHz.
Input and output at an 8 kHz sampling rate are also supported.
The EVRC WB codec can operate in three modes (0, 4, and 7) defined in [5].
EVRC WB modes 4 and 7 are interoperable with EVRC B.  EVRC WB mode 4 uses full rate, 1/2 rate, and 1/8 rate frames.
EVRC WB mode 7 uses only 1/2 rate and 1/8 rate frames.
Mode change results in codec output bit rate change but do not cause any decoding problems at the receiver.
For successful decoding, the decoder does not need to know the encoder's current mode of operation.
EVRC WB provides a standardized solution for packetized voice applications that allow transitions between narrowband and wideband telephony.
The most important service addressed is IP telephony.
Target devices can be IP phones or Voice over IP (VoIP) handsets, media gateways, voice messaging servers, etc.
The EVRC WB codec operates on 20 ms frames.
It produces output frames of one of the three different sizes: 171 bits, 80 bits, or 16 bits.
In addition, there are two zero bit codec frame types: blank (null) frames and erasure frames.
The default sampling rate is 16 kHz.
Input and output at an 8 kHz sampling rate are also supported.
The frame type values and sizes of the associated codec data frames are listed in the table below:
(SHOULD NOT be transmitted by sender)
The format of the RTP header is specified in RFC 3550 [6].
The EVRC WB payload formats (Section 6) use the fields of the RTP header in a manner consistent with RFC 3550 [6].
EVRC WB also has the capability to operate with 8 kHz sampled input/ output signals.
The decoder does not require a priori knowledge about the sampling rate of the original signal at the input of the encoder.
The decoder output can be at 8 kHz or 16 kHz regardless of the sampling rate used at the encoder.
Therefore, depending on the implementation and the electro acoustic audio capabilities of the devices, the input of the encoder and/or the output of the decoder can be configured at 8 kHz; however, a 16 kHz RTP clock rate MUST always be used.
The RTP timestamp is increased by 320 for each 20 milliseconds.
The RTP header marker bit (M) SHALL be set to 1 if the first frame carried in the packet contains a speech frame that is the first in a talkspurt.
For all other packets, the marker bit SHALL be set to zero (M 0).
Payload Format Three RTP packet formats are supported for the EVRC WB codec   the interleaved/bundled packet format, the header free packet format, and the compact bundled packet format.
For all these formats, the operational details and capabilities, such as Table of Contents (ToC), interleaving, DTX, and bundling, of EVRC WB are exactly the same as those of EVRC B, as defined in [3], except that the mode change request field in the ToC MUST be interpreted according to the definition of the RATE REDUC parameter as defined in EVRC WB [5].
The media type audio/EVRCWB maps to the interleaved/bundled packet format, audio/EVRCWB0 maps to the header free packet format, and audio/EVRCWB1 maps to the compact bundled packet format.
Congestion Control Considerations Congestion control for RTP SHALL be used in accordance with RFC 3550 [6], and with any applicable RTP profile, e.g., RFC 3551 [11].
Due to the header overhead, the number of frames encapsulated in each RTP packet influences the overall bandwidth of the RTP stream.
Packing more frames in each RTP packet can reduce the number of packets sent and hence the header overhead, at the expense of increased delay and reduced error robustness.
Storage Format for the EVRC WB Codec
The storage format is used for storing EVRC WB encoded speech frames, e.g., as a file or email attachment.
The file begins with a magic number to identify the vocoder that is used.
The magic number for EVRC WB corresponds to the ASCII character string "#!
EVCWB\n", i.e., "0x23 0x21 0x45 0x56
The codec data frames are stored in consecutive order, with a single ToC entry field, extended to one octet, prefixing each codec data frame.
The ToC field is extended to one octet by setting the four most significant bits of the octet to zero.
For example, a ToC value of 4 (a full rate frame) is stored as 0x04.
See Section 4 for the mapping from frame type to ToC value.
Speech frames lost in transmission and non received frames MUST be stored as erasure frames (ToC value of 5) to maintain synchronization with the original media.
This document updates the audio/EVRCB and audio/EVRCB0 media types defined in RFC 4788 [3] and adds new EVRC WB 'audio' media subtypes.
Following the guidelines in RFC 4855
RFC 4288 [10], this section registers new 'audio' media subtypes for EVRC WB and updates the audio/EVRCB and audio/EVRCB0 media type registrations contained in RFC 4788 [3].

SDP Mode Attributes for EVRC WB and EVRC B 'sendmode' can be used by a sender (EVRC WB or EVRC B) to announce its encoder's current mode of operation.
A sender can change its mode anytime, and this does not cause any decoding problems at the receiver. '
recvmode' is defined for use with EVRC B.  A decoder can use this attribute to inform an encoder of its preference to operate in a specified mode.
The receiver will continue to decode properly even if the sender does not operate in the preferred mode. '
mode set recv' is defined for use with EVRC WB.
A decoder can use this attribute to inform an encoder of its preference to operate in a specified subset of modes.
The receiver will continue to decode properly even if the sender does not operate in one of the preferred modes.
A set has been defined so that several modes can be expressed as a preference in one attempt.
For instance, the set {4,7} signals that the receiver prefers the sender to operate in narrowband modes of EVRC WB.
EVRC B Interoperability with Legacy Implementations (RFC 4788)
This document adds new optional parameters "recvmode" and "sendmode" to the original EVRC B media types "audio/EVRCB" and "audio/
EVRCB0" defined in RFC 4788
Existing RFC 4788 [3] implementations will not send these parameters in the Session Description Protocol (SDP) and will ignore them if they are received.
This will allow interoperability between RFC 4788 [3] and RFC 5188 implementations of EVRC B.
For an example offer and answer exchange, see Section 17.
Mapping EVRC WB Media Type Parameters into SDP Information carried in the media type specification has a specific mapping to fields in the Session Description Protocol (SDP)
[8], which is commonly used to describe RTP sessions.
When SDP is used to specify sessions employing EVRC WB
encoded speech, the mapping is as follows.
The media type ("audio") goes in SDP
"m " as the media name.
The media subtype ("EVRCWB", "EVRCWB0", or "EVRCWB1") goes in SDP "a rtpmap" as the encoding name.
The optional parameters 'ptime' and 'maxptime' (for subtypes EVRCWB, EVRCWB1) go in the SDP "a ptime" and "a maxptime" attributes, respectively.
Any remaining parameters (for subtypes EVRCWB, EVRCWB0, and EVRCWB1) go in the SDP
"a fmtp" attribute by copying them from the media type string as a semicolon separated list of parameter value pairs.
Mapping EVRC B Media Type Parameters into SDP
The new optional parameters 'recvmode' and 'sendmode' (for 'audio' subtypes EVRCB and EVRCB0) go in the SDP
"a fmtp" attribute by copying them directly from the media type string.
For all other media type parameters, the specification in Section 6.7 of RFC 4788 [3] still applies.
Offer Answer Model Considerations for EVRC WB
The following considerations apply when using the SDP offer answer procedures of RFC 3264 [7] to negotiate the use of EVRC WB payload in RTP:  Since EVRC WB is an extension of EVRC B, the offerer SHOULD announce EVRC B support in its "m audio" line, with EVRC WB as the preferred codec.
This will allow interoperability with an answerer that supports
only EVRC B. Below is an example of such an offer:
m audio 55954 RTP/AVP 98 99
a rtpmap:98 EVRCWB0/16000 a rtpmap:99 EVRCB0/8000 a fmtp:98 mode set recv
a fmtp:99 recvmode 0 sendmode 4
If the answerer supports EVRC WB, then the answerer can keep the payload type 98 in its answer and the conversation can be done using EVRC WB.
Else, if the answerer supports only EVRC B, then the answerer will leave only the payload type 99 in its answer and the conversation will be done using
EVRC B. An example answer for the above offer is the following:
m audio 55954 RTP/AVP 98
a rtpmap:98 EVRCWB0/16000 a fmtp:98 mode set recv
4;sendmode 4  'mode set recv' is a unidirectional receive only parameter.
'sendmode' is a unidirectional send only parameter.
Using 'sendmode', a sender can signal its current mode of operation.
Note that a receiver may receive RTP media well before the arrival of SDP with a (first time, or updated)
An offerer can use 'mode set recv' to request that the remote sender's encoder be limited to the list of modes signaled in 'mode set recv'.
A remote sender MAY ignore 'mode set recv' requests.
The parameters 'maxptime' and 'ptime' will in most cases not affect interoperability; however, the setting of the parameters can affect the performance of the application.
The SDP offer  answer handling of the 'ptime' parameter is described in RFC 3264 [7].
The 'maxptime' parameter MUST be handled in the same way.
For a sendonly stream, the 'mode set recv' parameter is not useful and SHOULD NOT be used.
For a recvonly stream, the 'sendmode' parameter is not useful and SHOULD NOT be used.
When using EVRCWB1, the entire session MUST use the same fixed rate and mode (0 Wideband or 4,7 Narrowband).
For additional rules that MUST be followed while negotiating DTX parameters, see Section 6.8 in [3].
Any unknown parameter in an SDP offer MUST be ignored by the receiver and MUST NOT be included in the SDP answer.
Offer Answer Model Considerations for EVRC B See Section 6.8 of [3] for offer answer usage of EVRC B.
The following are several additional considerations for EVRC B.  'recvmode' is a unidirectional receive only parameter.
'sendmode' is a unidirectional send only parameter.
Using 'recvmode', a receiver can signal the remote sender to operate its encoder in the specified mode.
A remote sender MAY ignore 'recvmode' requests.
Using 'sendmode', a sender can signal its current mode of operation.
Note that a receiver may receive RTP media well before the arrival of SDP with a (first time, or updated)
For a sendonly stream, the 'recvmode' parameter is not useful and SHOULD NOT be used.
For a recvonly stream, the 'sendmode' parameter is not useful and SHOULD NOT be used.
Declarative SDP Considerations For declarative use of SDP in the Session Announcement Protocol (SAP)
[12] and the Real Time Streaming Protocol (RTSP) [13], the following considerations apply:  Any 'maxptime' and 'ptime' values should be selected with care to ensure that the session's participants can achieve reasonable performance.
The payload format configuration parameters are all declarative, and a participant MUST use the configuration(s)
that is provided for the session.
More than one configuration may be provided if necessary by declaring multiple RTP payload types; however, the number of types should be kept small.
For declarative examples, see Section 17.
Some example SDP session descriptions utilizing EVRC WB and EVRC B encodings follow.
In these examples, long a fmtp lines are folded to meet the column width constraints of this document.
Note that media subtype names are case  insensitive.
Parameter names are case insensitive both in media types and in the mapping to the SDP a fmtp attribute.

m audio 55954 RTP/AVP 99 a rtpmap:99 EVRCB0/8000
a fmtp:99 recvmode 0 sendmode 4
In the above example, note that the answerer has chosen to send in mode 4 even though the offerer was willing to receive in mode 0. '
recvmode' is a receiver's preference, but the sender can send in a different mode.

Security Considerations Since compression is applied to the payload formats end to end, and the encodings do not exhibit significant non uniformity, implementations of this specification are subject to all the security considerations specified in RFC 3558 [2].
Implementations using the payload defined in this specification are subject to the security considerations discussed in RFC 3558 [2],
RFC 3550 [6], and any appropriate profile (for example, RFC 3551 [11]). 19.
This document updates RFC 4788 [3], and the updates are summarized below:  Added new media type attribute "sendmode" to media subtypes EVRCB and EVRCB0.
This attribute can be used to signal the EVRC B encoder's current mode of operation.
Added new media type attribute "recvmode" to media subtypes EVRCB and EVRCB0.
This attribute can be used to signal the EVRC B decoder's preferred operating mode to a remote sender.
