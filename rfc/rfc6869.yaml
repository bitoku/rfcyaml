  - "1.  Introduction\n   Version 4 of the vCard specification [RFC6350] defines a\
    \ new \"KIND\"\n   property to specify the type of entity that a vCard represents.\n\
    \   During its work on the base vCard4 specification, the VCARDDAV\n   Working\
    \ Group defined values of \"individual\", \"org\", \"group\", and\n   \"location\"\
    \ for the KIND property.\n   During working group discussion of the document that\
    \ became\n   [RFC6473], consideration was given to defining a more general value\n\
    \   of \"thing\", but it was decided to split \"thing\" into software\n   applications\
    \ and hardware devices and to define only the\n   \"application\" value at that\
    \ time.  Since then, use cases for device\n   vCards have emerged.  These use\
    \ cases involve using vCards as a\n   primer for inventory and asset tracking\
    \ data specific to network\n   elements.  Therefore, this document complements\
    \ [RFC6473] by defining\n   a value of \"device\" for the KIND property to represent\
    \ computing\n   devices such as appliances, computers, or network elements.  In\
    \ this\n   context, the concept of a device is constrained to computing devices\n\
    \   and thus is distinct from purely mechanical devices such as\n   elevators,\
    \ electric generators, etc., that cannot communicate in any\n   way over a network.\
    \  This does not preclude, however, network-\n   attached sensors that are connected\
    \ to such mechanical devices.\n"
- title: 2.  Scope
  contents:
  - "2.  Scope\n   When the KIND property has a value of \"device\", the vCard represents\n\
    \   a computing device such as an appliance, a computer, or a network\n   element\
    \ (e.g., a server, router, switch, printer, sensor, or phone).\n   More formally,\
    \ a \"device\" is functionally equivalent to the \"device\"\n   object class used\
    \ in the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol\n   [RFC4519] as derived from the\
    \ Open Systems Interconnection model\n   [X.521] [X.200].  However, whereas [X.521]\
    \ specifies that devices are\n   \"physical\" elements, a device in this context\
    \ can also be virtual\n   such as a virtual machine running within another physical\
    \ element.\n   As one example of the \"device\" KIND, vCards can be embedded into\n\
    \   devices at manufacturing time so that basic information such as\n   serial\
    \ number, support email, and documentation URL can be retrieved\n   upon initial\
    \ deployment.  This vCard can be modified after the device\n   is deployed to\
    \ contain user-specified data about the device's\n   characteristics.  The vCard\
    \ data can therefore be used for both asset\n   tracking and operational purposes.\n\
    \   A device might have a number of embedded vCards for varying purposes.\n  \
    \ The process for discovering and accessing these vCards is\n   purposefully left\
    \ unspecified in this document, as this process could\n   rely on any mechanism\
    \ that makes sense for the device in question.\n   For example, a device could\
    \ have one or more of the following vCard\n   instances:\n   o  The device itself.\
    \  For example, the FN (\"full name\") property\n      might represent the hostname\
    \ of a computing device; the URL\n      property might represent a website that\
    \ contains details on where\n      to find documentation or get further information\
    \ about the device;\n      the KEY property might represent a digital certificate\
    \ that was\n      provisioned into the device at the time of manufacture\n   \
    \   [IEEE.802.1AR], or a public key certificate previously provisioned\n     \
    \ into the device; and the ADR, GEO, and TZ properties might\n      represent\
    \ the physical address, geographical location, and time\n      zone where the\
    \ device is deployed.\n   o  An organization or person that produces or manufactures\
    \ the\n      device.\n   o  A person or role that maintains or administers the\
    \ device.\n   o  Application-level vCards as described in [RFC6473] for each\n\
    \      application installed on the device.\n   When a device has vCards other\
    \ than its KIND:device vCard, those\n   vCards can be linked together with RELATED\
    \ (see the definition of the\n   RELATED organizational property in Section 6.6.6\
    \ of [RFC6350]).  In\n   multi-vCard instances, the KIND:device vCard would use\
    \ the RELATED\n   property to express the relationship with the ancillary vCard(s).\n\
    \   Those supplementary vCards need not use RELATED to point back to the\n   KIND:device\
    \ vCard.  In this manner, the vCard for the device itself\n   can be easily distinguished\
    \ from vCards referring to the vendor\n   organization, device administrator,\
    \ and installed applications.\n   The following base properties make sense for\
    \ vCards that represent\n   devices (this list is not exhaustive, and other properties\
    \ might be\n   applicable as well):\n      *  ADR\n      *  EMAIL\n      *  FN\n\
    \      *  GEO\n      *  IMPP\n      *  KEY\n      *  KIND\n      *  LANG\n   \
    \   *  LOGO\n      *  NOTE\n      *  ORG\n      *  PHOTO\n      *  RELATED\n \
    \     *  REV\n      *  SOURCE\n      *  TEL\n      *  TZ\n      *  UID\n     \
    \ *  URL\n   Although it might be desirable to define a more fine-grained taxonomy\n\
    \   of devices (e.g., a KIND of \"device\" with a subtype of \"router\" or\n \
    \  \"computer\"), such a taxonomy is out of scope for this document.\n"

    \ specified for\n   vCards in general as described in [RFC6350].  Nevertheless,\
    \ risks can\n   arise for vulnerable Internet-connected devices as a result of\
    \ the\n   publication of the identification details provided by device vCards.\n\
    \   Well-known publicly accessible device vCard repositories, while not\n   defined\
    \ in this document, can increase the probability of an\n   exploitation of an\
    \ existing vulnerability, especially for devices\n   with no good way to update\
    \ their software or firmware.  It is the\n   responsibility of the device administrator\
    \ to adhere to best current\n   security practices and employ proper strategies\
    \ for software upgrades\n   and security patches in order to mitigate vulnerability\
    \ to attack.\n   Specifications defining device-specific vCard extensions or profiles\n\
    \   that might be included in such vCards also need to consider this\n   potential\
    \ increased risk.\n"
