This memo defines an extension to the Management Information Base (MIB) for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
In particular, it defines objects for the management of coffee brewing and maintenance devices.
The SNMPv2 Network Management Framework
Network Management Framework consists of four major components.
[2] defines MIB II, the core set of managed objects for the Internet suite of protocols.
[3] which defines the administrative and other architectural aspects of the framework.
RFC 1448 [4] which defines the protocol used for network access to managed objects.
The Framework permits new objects to be defined for the purpose of experimentation and evaluation.
Object Definitions Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed the Management Information Base or MIB.
Objects in the MIB are defined using the subset of Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1) defined in the SMI.
In particular, each object object type is named by an OBJECT IDENTIFIER, an administratively assigned name.
The object type together with an object instance serves to uniquely identify a specific instantiation of the object.
For human convenience, we often use a textual string, termed the descriptor, to refer to the object type.
The COFFEE POT MIB applies to managed devices that brew, store, and deliver heated coffee beverages.
The COFFEE POT MIB is mandatory for all systems that have such a hardware port supporting services managed through some other MIB.
The MIB contains objects that relate to physical connections, configuration, storage levels, availabilty, quality of service, and availability.
The COFFEE POT MIB is one of many MIBs designed for layered use as described in the Interface MIB [5].
In most implementations where it is present, it will be in the lowest interface sublayer, that is, the COFFEE POT MIB represents the physical layer, providing service to higher layers such as the Character MIB [6].
Although it is unlikely that a coffee port will actually be used as a network interface, which is the intent of the Interface MIB, the COFFEE POT MIB is closely connected to the Character MIB, which can share hardware interfaces with network operation, and relate to the RS 232 MIB [7].
The Interface MIB's ifTestTable and ifRcvAddressTable are not relevant to the COFFEE POT MIB.
The COFFEE POT MIB is relevant for ifType values sip(31), and perhaps others.
The COFFEE POT MIB requires the conformance groups ifGeneralGroup, and ifFixedLengthGroup.
Usefulness of error counters in this MIB depends on the octet counters in ifFixedLengthGroup.
