    \  RFC 791 (in IPTW)\n      COMMENTS:\n         A few minor problems have been\
    \ noted in this document.\n         The most serious is a bit of confusion in\
    \ the route options.\n         The route options have a pointer that indicates\
    \ which octet of\n         the route is the next to be used.  The confusion is\
    \ between the\n         phrases \"the pointer is relative to this option\" and\
    \ \"the\n         smallest legal value for the pointer is 4\".  If you are\n \
    \        confused, forget about the relative part, the pointer begins\n      \
    \   at 4.\n         Another important point is the alternate reassembly procedure\n\
    \         suggested in RFC 815.\n         Note that ICMP is defined to be an integral\
    \ part of IP.  You\n         have not completed an implementation of IP if it\
    \ does not\n         include ICMP.\n      OTHER REFERENCES:\n         RFC 815\

    \   SPECIFICATION:  RFC 768 (in IPTW)\n      COMMENTS:\n         The only change\
    \ noted for the UDP specification is a minor\n         clarification that if in\
    \ computing the checksum a padding octet\n         is used for the computation\
    \ it is not transmitted or counted in\n         the length.\n      OTHER REFERENCES:\n\

    \ Control Protocol (TCP)\n      STATUS:  Recommended\n      SPECIFICATION:  RFC\
    \ 793 (in IPTW)\n      COMMENTS:\n         Many comments and corrections have\
    \ been received for the TCP\n         specification document.  These are primarily\
    \ document bugs\n         rather than protocol bugs.\n         Event Processing\
    \ Section:  There are many minor corrections and\n         clarifications needed\
    \ in this section.\n         Push:  There are still some phrases in the document\
    \ that give a\n         \"record mark\" flavor to the push.  These should be further\n\
    \         clarified.  The push is not a record mark.\n         Listening Servers:\
    \  Several comments have been received on\n         difficulties with contacting\
    \ listening servers.  There should\n         be some discussion of implementation\
    \ issues for servers, and\n         some notes on alternative models of system\
    \ and process\n         organization for servers.\n         Maximum Segment Size:\
    \  The maximum segment size option should\n         be generalized and clarified.\
    \  It can be used to either\n         increase or decrease the maximum segment\
    \ size from the default.\n         The default should be established more clearly.\
    \  The default is\n         based on the default maximum Internet Datagram size\
    \ which is\n         576 octets counting the IP and TCP headers.  The option counts\n\
    \         only the segment data.  For each of IP and TCP the minimum\n       \
    \  header is 20 octets and the maximum header is 60 octets. So the\n         default\
    \ maximum data segment is could be anywhere from 456 to\n         536 octets.\
    \  The current proposal is to set it at 536 data\n         octets.\n         Idle\
    \ Connections:  There have been questions about\n         automatically closing\
    \ idle connections.  Idle connections are\n         ok, and should not be closed.\
    \  There are several cases where\n         idle connections arise, for example,\
    \ in Telnet when a user is\n         thinking for a long time following a message\
    \ from the server\n         computer before his next input.  There is no TCP \"\
    probe\"\n         mechanism, and none is needed.\n         Queued Receive Data\
    \ on Closing:  There are several points where\n         it is not clear from the\
    \ description what to do about data\n         received by the TCP but not yet\
    \ passed to the user,\n         particularly when the connection is being closed.\
    \  In general,\n                                                      Official\
    \ Protocols\n         the data is to be kept to give to the user if he does a\
    \ RECV\n         call.\n         Out of Order Segments:  The description says\
    \ that segments that\n         arrive out of order, that is, are not exactly the\
    \ next segment\n         to be processed, may be kept on hand.  It should also\
    \ point out\n         that there is a very large performance penalty for not doing\n\
    \         so.\n         User Time Out:  This is the time out started on an open\
    \ or send\n         call.  If this user time out occurs the user should be\n \
    \        notified, but the connection should not be closed or the TCB\n      \
    \   deleted.  The user should explicitly ABORT the connection if he\n        \
    \ wants to give up.\n      OTHER REFERENCES:\n         RFC 813 (in IPIG) - Window\

    \ Internet.\n         Data Connection Management:\n            a.  Default Data\
    \ Connection Ports:  All FTP implementations\n            must support use of\
    \ the default data connection ports, and\n            only the User-PI may initiate\
    \ the use of non-default ports.\n                                            \
    \          Official Protocols\n            b.  Negotiating Non-Default Data Ports:\
    \   The User-PI may\n            specify a non-default user side data port with\
    \ the PORT\n            command.  The User-PI may request the server side to\n\
    \            identify a non-default server side data port with the PASV\n    \
    \        command.  Since a connection is defined by the pair of\n            addresses,\
    \ either of these actions is enough to get a\n            different data connection,\
    \ still it is permitted to do both\n            commands to use new ports on both\
    \ ends of the data\n            connection.\n            c.  Reuse of the Data\
    \ Connection:  When using the stream\n            mode of data transfer the end\
    \ of the file must be indicated\n            by closing the connection.  This\
    \ causes a problem if\n            multiple files are to be transfered in the\
    \ session, due to\n            need for TCP to hold the connection record for\
    \ a time out\n            period to guarantee the reliable communication.  Thus\
    \ the\n            connection can not be reopened at once.\n               There\
    \ are two solutions to this problem.  The first is to\n               negotiate\
    \ a non-default port (as in (b) above).  The\n               second is to use\
    \ another transfer mode.\n               A comment on transfer modes.  The stream\
    \ transfer mode is\n               inherently unreliable, since one can not determine\
    \ if the\n               connection closed prematurely or not.  The other transfer\n\
    \               modes (Block, Compressed) do not close the connection to\n   \
    \            indicate the end of file.  They have enough FTP encoding\n      \
    \         that the data connection can be parsed to determine the\n          \
    \     end of the file.  Thus using these modes one can leave\n               the\
    \ data connection open for multiple file transfers.\n               Why this was\
    \ not a problem with the old NCP FTP:\n                  The NCP was designed\
    \ with only the ARPANET in mind.\n                  The ARPANET provides very\
    \ reliable service, and the\n                  NCP counted on it.  If any packet\
    \ of data from an NCP\n                  connection were lost or damaged by the\
    \ network the NCP\n                  could not recover.  It is a tribute to the\
    \ ARPANET\n                  designers that the NCP FTP worked so well.\n    \
    \              The TCP is designed to provide reliable connections\n         \
    \         over many different types of networks and\n                  interconnections\
    \ of networks.  TCP must cope with a\n                  set of networks that can\
    \ not promise to work as well\n                  as the ARPANET.  TCP must make\
    \ its own provisions for\n                  end-to-end recovery from lost or damaged\
    \ packets.\n                  This leads to the need for the connection phase-down\n\
    \                  time-out.  The NCP never had to deal with\n               \
    \   acknowledgements or retransmissions or many other\n                      \
    \                                Official Protocols\n                  things\
    \ the TCP must do to make connection reliable in\n                  a more complex\
    \ world.\n         LIST and NLST:\n            There is some confusion about the\
    \ LIST an NLST commands, and\n            what is appropriate to return.  Some\
    \ clarification and\n            motivation for these commands should be added\
    \ to the\n            specification.\n      OTHER REFERENCES:\n         RFC 678\
