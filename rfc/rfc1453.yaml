  - "Abstract\n   The new generation of multimedia applications demands new features\n\
    \   and new mechanisms for proper performance.  ATM technology has moved\n   from\
    \ concept to reality, delivering very high bandwidths and new\n   capabilities\
    \ to the data link layer user.  In an effort to anticipate\n   the high bandwidth-delay\
    \ data link layer, Delta-t [Delta-t], NETBLT\n   [RFC 988], and VMTP [RFC 1045]\
    \ were developed.  The excellent\n   insights and mechanisms pioneered by the\
    \ creators of these\n   experimental Internet protocols were used in the design\
    \ of Xpress\n   Transfer Protocol (XTP) [XTP92] with the goal of eventually\n\
    \   delivering ATM bandwidths to a user process.  This RFC is a vehicle\n   to\
    \ inform the Internet community about XTP as it benefits from past\n   Internet\
    \ activity and targets general-purpose applications and\n   multimedia applications\
    \ with the emerging ATM networks in mind.\n"

  - "1.  Introduction\n   Networking is no longer synonymous with analog telephony.\
    \  High-\n   performance lower-layer networks have made possible exciting new\n\
    \   applications: collaboratory environments, distributed client/server\n   computing,\
    \ remote conferencing, teleclassrooms, and distributed\n   life-sciences imaging.\
    \  These applications normally demand a great\n   deal of bandwidth and often\
    \ create operating system bottlenecks.\n   Enabling these new multimedia applications\
    \ entails delivering\n   bandwidth to the applications, not just having bandwidth\
    \ available on\n   the network.  This statement may appear obvious, but often\
    \ solutions\n   at the transport layer are satisfied by having bandwidth at that\n\
    \   layer without sufficient sensitivity to higher-layer access to the\n   bandwidth.\
    \  The unavailability of bandwidth at upper layers is\n   becoming the real issue\
    \ as the networks are becoming a high-\n   performance virtual backplane without\
    \ concomitant high-performance\n   control schemes.  It appears that new services\
    \ are needed that\n   require communication with all layers.  The ATM architecture\
    \ calls\n   for such an integrated control scheme.\n"

  - "2.  Remote Conferencing\n   The challenges of remote conferencing is an application\
    \ whose\n   challenges may be met at the data link layer by the emerging\n   broadband\
    \ networks.  If so, important medical applications such as\n   medical imaging\
    \ for diagnosis and treatment planning would be\n   possible [CHIM92].  Remote\
    \ conferencing would permit imaging\n   applications for life sciences through\
    \ the use of national resource\n   centers.  Collaboratory conferences in molecular\
    \ modeling, design\n   efforts, and visualization of data in numerous disciplines\
    \ could\n   become possible.\n   At the Second Packet Video Workshop, held December,\
    \ 1992, at MCNC in\n   the Research Triangle Park, North Carolina, a recurrent\
    \ theme was the\n   use of multimedia in remote conferencing.  Its applications\
    \ included\n   the use of interactive, synchronized voice and video transmission,\n\
    \   multicast transmission, data transfer, graphics transmission,\n   noninteractive\
    \ video and audio transmission, and data base query\n   within a virtually shared\
    \ workspace.  A few participants doubted the\n   ability of current computer networks\
    \ to handle these multimedia\n   applications and preferred only connection-oriented,\
    \ circuit-switched\n   services.  Most participants, however, looked forward to\
    \ using an\n   integrated network approach.\n"
- title: 2.1.  Remote Conferencing Functions and Requirements
  contents:
  - "2.1.  Remote Conferencing Functions and Requirements\n   Remote conferencing\
    \ as seen at the workshop requires a set of\n   functions.  It must provide session\
    \ scheduling that deals with\n   initiating a session, joining in-progress sessions,\
    \ leaving a session\n   without tearing it down if there are multiple participants,\
    \ and\n   terminating a session.\n   The remote-conferencing session needs a control\
    \ subsystem that is\n   either tightly controlled for an n-to-n connection for\
    \ two to 15\n   participants, or loosely controlled for a 1-to-n connection for\
    \ any\n   number of participants.  The Multipeer-Multicast Consortium is\n   working\
    \ on defining the control requirements and the mechanisms for\n   control.  At\
    \ the Packet Video Workshop, one participant presented a\n   conference control\
    \ protocol (CCP) shown in Figure 1 [CCP92].  In this\n   architecture the CCP\
    \ controls the Network Voice Protocol (NVP)\n   [RFC741] and the Packet Video\
    \ Protocol (PVP) [PVP81] over the\n   experimental Internet Stream Protocol, Version\
    \ 2 (ST-II) [RFC1190]\n   rather than IP.\n   Latency and intramedia synchronization\
    \ and intermedia synchronization\n   (lip-sync) are critical for the interactive\
    \ voice and video streams\n   of remote conferencing.  Client/server applications\
    \ including data\n   base operations are equally important.  The ability to display\n\
    \   noninteractive video and high-resolution graphics is necessary.\n   As with\
    \ most applications, security will eventually be an issue.  At\n   the very least,\
    \ there must be a mechanism to determine who can find\n   out what about conference\
    \ and who can join a conference.  This\n   determination will be part of an upper-layer\
    \ protocol.\n      +--------------+ +--------+ +-----+ +------------+\n      |Teleconference|\

    \ single machines through\n   LAN, CAN, MAN, WAN conferences, as well as in data\
    \ content from PCs\n   to high-end workstations.  Implicit in the scaling is the\
    \ notion of\n   product and application interoperability.\n   Remote conferencing\
    \ applications should take advantage of future\n   network enhancements, as well\
    \ as the functions provided by ATM, FDDI,\n   and SMDS.  Doing so should provide\
    \ function versus resource trade-\n   offs such as cost versus error control and\
    \ cost versus rate control.\n   As a result, the transport layer should be able\
    \ to provide the\n   services offered by the data link layer.\n   Most of the\
    \ presentation on remote conferencing indicated a need for\n   some degree of\
    \ multicast functionality, ranging from the 1-to-n, with\n   conference membership\
    \ completely known, to conferences for which\n   existence of a group is known,\
    \ but exact membership is not.\n   In remote conferencing, it is preferable to\
    \ use one network for all\n   information traffic.  This network should have an\
    \ offered quality of\n   service (QOS) criteria to accommodate tradeoff metrics,\
    \ which would\n   include guaranteed throughput, connection reliability, high\
    \ call-\n   completion rate, few dropped calls, tolerable error rate, varying\n\
    \   degrees of compression on the video and audio streams, and tolerable\n   motion\
    \ artifacts, flow control, and latency.  The QOS should be an\n   input to the\
    \ transport layer from the application or transport\n   service user.\n   The\
    \ compression/coding function should provide time-stamping and\n   packetizing\
    \ information, as well as real-time echo cancellation.\n   These functions are\
    \ usually at the presentation and session layer of\n   the Open System Interconnection\
    \ (OSI) model or the at the application\n   in some Internet models, but not the\
    \ transport layer.\n"

  - "3.  Potential Solutions\n   RFC 1193 deals with the requirements of real-time\

    \ But the\n   requirements articulated create the necessity for new\n   transport/network\

    \ the performance\n   desired.  A session-scheduling mechanism for joining and\
    \ leaving a\n   multicast conference exists.  The XTP mechanism for multicast\n\
    \   satisfies the loosely controlled session requirements.  The tightly\n   controlled\
    \ session would require the use of multiple XTP\n   associations.\n   The priority\
    \ mechanism that uses the 32-bit SORT field permits an\n   application to prioritize\
    \ data.  Because XTP is a transport layer,\n   this priority mechanism follows\
    \ through every node tranversed.  There\n   is also an out-of-band delivery mechanism.\
    \  However, XTP does not\n   offer latency control by itself; it just provides\
    \ a priority\n   mechanism.\n   The selective acknowledgement, fast negative acknowledgement,\
    \ and\n   selective retransmission permit an application to choose an\n   appropriate\
    \ level of error control.  The combination of the priority\n   mechanism and these\
    \ error-control mechanisms is likely to approach\n   the latency and synchronization\
    \ requirements of remote conferencing.\n   Noninteractive audio and video, as\
    \ well as graphics presentation, can\n   be accommodated in many ways by the application.\
    \  It is important\n   that the transport layer provides adequate mechanisms to\
    \ deliver the\n   appropriate data streams in a manner compatible with the\n \
    \  applications.  These applications can probably be accomplished by\n   means\
    \ of extant protocols, as well as XTP.\n   The scalability of the solution will\
    \ be a function of the standards\n   used.  At the Packet Video Workshop, some\
    \ of the applications\n   sacrificed computer network standards in favor of desired\n\
    \   performance.  This approach usually impedes scalability.  From the\n   explanation\
    \ of the applications taking this approach, it appeared\n   that using XTP would\
    \ have provided an adequate transport service for\n   the applications.\n   XTP\
    \ was designed to provide mechanisms to accommodate application\n   requirements,\
    \ that is, the ability to respond to QOS requests.  For\n   example, guaranteed\
    \ throughput may be accomplished by using XTP's\n   rate and burst control together\
    \ with flow control or no flow control.\n   Tolerable error rate can be accomplished\
    \ with partially error\n   controlled connections (PECC), a service which can\
    \ be placed in the\n   application or just above the transport layer [PECC92].\
    \  Motion\n   artifacts and varying degrees of compression should be done above\
    \ the\n   transport layer in coordination with the transport layer or possibly\n\
    \   in a network management function.\n"

    \ enable multimedia applications\n   such as remote conferencing, the XTP forum\
    \ members have been\n   experimenting with major elements of these applications.\n\
    \   (1)  At the University of Virginia, more than 100 simulated voice\n      \
    \  channels were run on an FDDI network [UVAVOICE92].  The\n        purpose of\
    \ this experiment was to test the limits of FDDI\n        and a software version\
    \ of XTP in a simulated interactive\n        voice environment.  Multicasted,\
    \ noninteractive video has\n        been supported there for several years.\n\
    \        UVa also has a video-mail demo over XTP/FDDI that uses\n        Fluent\
    \ multimedia interface and standard JPEG compression.\n        This PC-based demo\
    \ delivers full frame, full color, 30\n        frames/sec video from any network\
    \ disk to a remote VGA\n        screen.  It is important that users could not\
    \ discern any\n        difference  in  playback  between  a local disk and a remote\n\
    \        disk.  An Xpress File System (XFS) is used on server and\n        client\
    \ systems.\n   (2)  The Technical University of Berlin, Germany, reports that\n\
    \        the coordination, implementation, and operation of\n        multimedia\
    \ services (CIO) of the R&D in Advanced\n        Communications Technologies in\
    \ Europe (RACE) is using XTP as\n        a starting point for design [XTPRACE].\n\
    \   (3)  At the Naval Command, Control, and Ocean Surveillance Center\n      \
    \  Research, Development, Test and Evaluation Division NRaD\n        (formerly\
    \ the Naval Ocean Systems Command (NOSC)), voice is\n        multicasted over\
    \ XTP/FDDI.  A simple multicast is\n        distributed to a group with a latency\
    \ of around 25 ms, where\n        the latency represents delay from the voice\
    \ signal from the\n        microphone to the audio signal to the speaker.  This\
    \ group\n        is currently doing research on an n-party multicast of voice\n\
    \        (telephone conference-call paradigm [n x n multicast]).\n   (4)  Commercially,\
    \ Starlight Networks Inc., migrated a subset of\n        XTP into the transport\
    \ layer of its video application\n        server.  By using XTP rate control,\
    \ full-motion, full-screen\n        compressed video is delivered at a constant\
    \ 1.2 Mbps, over\n        switched-hub Ethernet to viewstations.  This network\n\
    \        delivers at least 10 simultaneous video streams.\n   Therefore, XTP has\
    \ been used in applications that were previously\n   placed over IP or even a\
    \ data link layer.\n"
