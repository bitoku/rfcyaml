- title: 1.  Introduction

  - "1.  Introduction\n   There are many situations where a DHCP relay agent is involved,\
    \ and\n   it can easily insert a Relay Agent Information option [3] with\n   appropriate\
    \ suboptions into DHCPDISCOVER messages.  Once the lease\n   has been granted,\
    \ however, future DHCPREQUEST messages sent by a\n   client in RENEWING state\
    \ are sent directly to the DHCP server, as\n   specified in the Server Identifier\
    \ option.  In this case, the relay\n   may not see these DHCPREQUEST messages\
    \ (depending upon network\n   topology) and thus cannot insert the Relay Agent\
    \ Information option\n   in the DHCPREQUEST messages.\n   This DHCP relay agent\
    \ suboption, Server Identifier Override, allows\n   the relay agent to tell the\
    \ DHCP server what value to place into the\n   Server Identifier option [5]. \
    \ Using this, the relay agent can force\n   a host in RENEWING state to send DHCPREQUEST\
    \ messages to the relay\n   agent instead of directly to the server.  The relay\
    \ agent then has\n   the opportunity to insert the Relay Agent Information option\
    \ with\n   appropriate suboptions and relay the DHCPREQUEST to the actual\n  \
    \ server.  In this fashion, the DHCP server will be provided with the\n   same\
    \ relay agent information upon renewals (such as Circuit-ID,\n   Remote-ID, Device\
    \ Class, etc.) as was provided in the initial\n   DHCPDISCOVER message.\n   In\
    \ short, this new suboption allows the DHCPv4 relay to function in\n   the same\
    \ fashion as the DHCPv6 relay [7] currently does.\n"

- title: 4.  Server Identifier Override Suboption Definition
  contents:
  - "4.  Server Identifier Override Suboption Definition\n   The format of the suboption\
    \ is:\n   Code   Len    Overriding Server Identifier Address\n   +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+\n\
    \   | 11  |  n  | a1  | a2  | a3  | a4  |\n   +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+\n\
    \                                 Figure 1\n   The option length (n) is 4.  The\
    \ octets \"a1\" through \"a4\" specify the\n   value that MUST be inserted into\
    \ the Server Identifier option by the\n   DHCP Server upon reply.\n   DHCP servers\
    \ that implement this Relay Agent Information suboption\n   MUST use this value,\
    \ if present in a DHCP message received from a\n   client, as the value to insert\
    \ into the Server Identifier option in\n   the corresponding response.  The DHCP\
    \ server must also record the\n   address in the suboption for use in subsequent\
    \ messages to the DHCP\n   client until the next DHCP message is received from\
    \ the DHCP relay\n   agent.\n   If a DHCP server does not understand/implement\
    \ this Relay Information\n   suboption, it will ignore the suboption, and thus\
    \ it will insert its\n   own appropriate interface address in the Server Identifier\
    \ option.\n   In this case, the DHCP Relay will not receive RENEW DHCPREQUEST\n\
    \   messages from the client.  When configuring a DHCP relay agent to use\n  \
    \ this suboption, the administrator of the relay agent should take into\n   account\
    \ whether or not the DHCP server to which the message will be\n   relayed will\
    \ correctly understand this suboption.\n   When servicing a DHCPREQUEST message,\
    \ the DHCP server would normally\n   look at the Server Identifier option for\
    \ verification that the\n   address specified there is one of the addresses associated\
    \ with the\n   DHCP server, silently ignoring the DHCPREQUEST if it does not match\
    \ a\n   configured DHCP server interface address.  If the DHCPREQUEST message\n\
    \   contains a Server Identifier Override suboption, however, comparison\n   should\
    \ be made between the address in this suboption and the Server\n   Identifier\
    \ option.  If both the Server Identifier Override suboption\n   and the Server\
    \ Identifier option specify the same address, then the\n   server should accept\
    \ the DHCPREQUEST message for processing,\n   regardless of whether or not the\
    \ Server Identifier option matches a\n   DHCP server interface.\n   The DHCP relay\
    \ agent should fill in the giaddr field when relaying\n   the message, just as\
    \ it normally would do.\n   In a situation where the DHCP relay agent is configured\
    \ to forward\n   messages to more than one server, the DHCP relay agent SHOULD\
    \ forward\n   all DHCP messages to all servers.  This applies to RENEW DHCPREQUEST\n\
    \   messages as well.  The intent is that the DHCP relay agent should not\n  \
    \ need to maintain state information about the DHCP lease.\n   DHCP relay agents\
    \ implementing this suboption SHOULD also implement\n   and use the DHCPv4 Relay\
    \ Agent Flags Suboption [4] in order to\n   specify whether the DHCP relay agent\
    \ received the original message as\n   a broadcast or unicast.  The DHCP server\
    \ receiving a message\n   containing the Server Identifier Override Suboption\
    \ may use this\n   additional information in processing the message.\n   Note\
    \ that if the DHCP relay agent becomes inaccessible by the DHCP\n   client or\
    \ loses network access to the DHCP server, further RENEW\n   DHCPREQUEST messages\
    \ from the DHCP client may not be properly\n   processed and the DHCP client's\
    \ lease may time out.\n"
- title: 5.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "5.  Security Considerations\n   Message authentication in DHCP for intradomain\
    \ use where the out-of-\n   band exchange of a shared secret is feasible is defined\
    \ in [6].\n   Potential exposures to attack are discussed in Section 7 of the\
    \ DHCP\n   protocol specification in [2].\n   The DHCP Relay Agent Information\
    \ option depends on a trusted\n   relationship between the DHCP relay agent and\
    \ the DHCP server, as\n   described in Section 5 of RFC 3046.  While the introduction\
    \ of\n   fraudulent DHCP relay agent information options can be prevented by a\n\
    \   perimeter defense that blocks these options unless the DHCP relay\n   agent\
    \ is trusted, a deeper defense using the authentication suboption\n   for DHCP\
    \ relay agent information option [8] SHOULD be deployed as\n   well.\n   If a\
    \ rogue DHCP relay agent were inserted between the DHCP client and\n   the DHCP\
    \ server, it could redirect clients to itself using this\n   suboption.  This\
    \ would allow such a system to later deny RENEW\n   DHCPREQUESTs and thus force\
    \ clients to discontinue use of their\n   allocated addresses.  It could also\
    \ allow the rogue relay to change,\n   insert, or delete DHCP options in DHCPACK\
    \ messages and extend leases\n   beyond what the server has allowed.  DHCP authentication\
    \ [6] and/or\n   DHCP Relay Agent Information option authentication [8] would\
    \ address\n   this case.  (Note that, as is always the case, lack of DHCP\n  \
    \ authentication would allow a rogue DHCP relay agent to change the\n   Server\
    \ Identifier Override option in the DHCPOFFER and DHCPACK\n   messages without\
    \ detection.  This threat is not new to the Server\n   Identifier Override suboption.)\n\
    \   This document does not add any new vulnerabilities that were not\n   already\
    \ present, except in the case where DHCP authentication is\n   already in place,\
    \ and DHCP clients require its use.  It is suggested\n   that DHCP Authentication\
    \ and DHCP Relay Agent Option Authentication\n   SHOULD be deployed when this\
    \ option is used, or protection should be\n   provided against the insertion of\
    \ rogue DHCP relay agents between the\n   client and server.\n   This relay suboption\
    \ is not intended, by itself, to provide any\n   additional security benefits.\n"
