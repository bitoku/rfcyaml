  - "1.  Introduction\n   As described in [RFC3945], GMPLS extends MPLS from supporting\
    \ only\n   Packet Switch Capable (PSC) interfaces and switching, to also support\n\
    \   four new classes of interfaces and switching that include Lambda\n   Switch\
    \ Capable (LSC).\n   A functional description of the extensions to MPLS signaling\
    \ needed\n   to support this new class of interface and switching is provided\
    \ in\n   [RFC3471].\n   Section 3.2.1.1 of [RFC3471] states that wavelength labels\
    \ \"only have\n   significance between two neighbors\": global wavelength semantics\
    \ are\n   not considered.  [RFC6205] defines a standard lambda label format\n\
    \   that has a global semantic and is compliant with both the Dense\n   Wavelength\
    \ Division Multiplexing (DWDM) grid [G.694.1] and the Coarse\n   Wavelength Division\
    \ Multiplexing (CWDM) grid [G.694.2].  The terms\n   DWDM and CWDM are defined\
    \ in [G.671].\n   A flexible-grid network selects its data channels as arbitrarily\n\
    \   assigned pieces of the spectrum.  Mixed bitrate transmission systems\n   can\
    \ allocate their channels with different spectral bandwidths so\n   that the channels\
    \ can be optimized for the bandwidth requirements of\n   the particular bit rate\
    \ and modulation scheme of the individual\n   channels.  This technique is regarded\
    \ as a promising way to improve\n   the network utilization efficiency and fundamentally\
    \ reduce the cost\n   of the core network.\n   The \"flexi-grid\" has been developed\
    \ within the ITU-T Study Group 15\n   to allow selection and switching of pieces\
    \ of the optical spectrum\n   chosen flexibly from a fine-granularity grid of\
    \ wavelengths with\n   variable spectral bandwidth [G.694.1].\n   [RFC3471] defines\
    \ several basic label types including the lambda\n   label.  Section 3.2.1.1 of\
    \ [RFC3471] states that wavelength labels\n   \"only have significance between\
    \ two neighbors\"; global wavelength\n   semantics are not considered.  In order\
    \ to facilitate\n   interoperability in a network composed of LSC equipment, [RFC6205]\n\
    \   defines a standard lambda label format and is designated an update of\n  \
    \ RFC 3471.\n   This document continues the theme of defining global semantics\
    \ for\n   the wavelength label by adding support for the flexi-grid.  Thus,\n\
    \   this document updates [RFC6205] and [RFC3471].\n   This document relies on\
    \ [G.694.1] for the definition of the optical\n   data plane and does not make\
    \ any updates to the work of the ITU-T.\n"

- title: 2.  Overview of Flexi-Grid
  contents:
  - "2.  Overview of Flexi-Grid\n   [G.694.1] defines DWDM fixed grids.  The latest\
    \ version of that\n   document extends the DWDM fixed grids to add support for\
    \ flexible\n   grids.  The basis of the work is to allow a data channel to be\
    \ formed\n   from an abstract grid anchored at 193.1 THz and selected on a channel\n\
    \   spacing of 6.25 GHz with a variable slot width measured in units of\n   12.5\
    \ GHz.  Individual allocations may be made on this basis from\n   anywhere in\
    \ the spectrum, subject to allocations not overlapping.\n   [G.694.1] provides\
    \ clear guidance on the support of flexible grid by\n   implementations in Section\
    \ 2 of Appendix I:\n      The flexible DWDM grid defined in clause 7 has a nominal\
    \ central\n      frequency granularity of 6.25 GHz and a slot width granularity\
    \ of\n      12.5 GHz.  However, devices or applications that make use of the\n\
    \      flexible grid may not have to be capable of supporting every\n      possible\
    \ slot width or position.  In other words, applications may\n      be defined\
    \ where only a subset of the possible slot widths and\n      positions are required\
    \ to be supported.\n      For example, an application could be defined where the\
    \ nominal\n      central frequency granularity is 12.5 GHz (by only requiring\n\
    \      values of n that are even) and that only requires slot widths as a\n  \
    \    multiple of 25 GHz (by only requiring values of m that are even).\n   Some\
    \ additional background on the use of GMPLS for flexible grids can\n   be found\
    \ in [RFC7698].\n"

  contents:
  - "2.1.  Composite Labels\n   It is possible to construct an end-to-end connection\
    \ as a composite\n   of more than one flexi-grid slot.  The mechanism used in\

    \   time-division multiplexing (TDM) and optical transport networks\n   (OTNs).\
    \  The slots in the set could potentially be contiguous or non-\n   contiguous\
    \ (only as allowed by the definitions of the data plane) and\n   could be signaled\
    \ as a single LSP or constructed from a group of\n   LSPs.  For more details,\

- title: 4.2.  Considerations of Bandwidth
  contents:
  - "4.2.  Considerations of Bandwidth\n   There is some overlap between the concepts\
    \ of bandwidth and label in\n   many GMPLS-based systems where a label indicates\
    \ a physical switching\n   resource.  This overlap is increased in a flexi-grid\
    \ system where a\n   label value indicates the slot width and so affects the bandwidth\n\
    \   supported by an LSP.  Thus, the m parameter is both a property of the\n  \
    \ label (i.e., it helps define exactly what is switched) and of the\n   bandwidth.\n\
    \   In GMPLS signaling [RFC3473], bandwidth is requested in the\n   SENDER_TSPEC\
    \ object and confirmed in the FLOWSPEC object.  The m\n   parameter, which is\
    \ a parameter of the GMPLS flexi-grid label as\n   described above, is also a\
    \ parameter of the flexi-grid Tspec and\n   Flowspec as described in [FLEXRSVP].\n"
- title: 4.3.  Composite Labels
  contents:
  - "4.3.  Composite Labels\n   The creation of a composite of multiple channels to\
    \ support inverse\n   multiplexing is already supported in GMPLS for TDM and OTN\
    \ (see\n   [RFC4606], [RFC6344], and [RFC7139]).  The mechanism used for flexi-\n\
    \   grid is similar.\n   To signal an LSP that uses multiple flexi-grid slots,\
    \ a \"compound\n   label\" is constructed.  That is, the LABEL object is constructed\

  - "5.1.  Control-Plane Backward Compatibility\n   Labels are carried in two ways\
    \ in GMPLS: for immediate use on the\n   next hop and for use at remote hops.\n\
    \   It is an assumption of GMPLS that both ends of a link know what label\n  \
    \ types are supported and only use appropriate label types.  If a label\n   of\
    \ an unknown type is received, it will be processed as if it was of\n   a known\
    \ type since the Label Object and similar label-carrying\n   objects do not contain\
    \ a type identifier.  Thus, the introduction of\n   a flexi-grid label in this\
    \ document does not change the compatibility\n   issues, and a legacy node that\
    \ does not support the new flexi-grid\n   label should not expect to receive or\
    \ handle such labels.  If one is\n   incorrectly used in communication with a\

    \   might record flexi-grid labels in a Record Route Object that is\n   subsequently\

    \  Section 3.2 of [RFC3471] makes clear that a label is of variable\n   length\
    \ according to the type and that the type is supposed to be\n   known a priori\
    \ by both ends of a link, a management system is not\n   guaranteed to be updated\
    \ in step with upgrades or installations of\n   new flexi-grid functionality in\
    \ the network.\n   But, an implementation expecting a 32-bit lambda label would\
    \ not fail\n   ungracefully because the first 32 bits follow the format of\n \
    \  [RFC6205].  It would look at theses labels and read but not recognize\n   the\
    \ new grid type value.  It would then give up trying to parse the\n   label and\
    \ (presumably) the whole of the rest of the message.\n   The management system\
    \ can be upgraded in two steps:\n   -  Firstly, systems that handle lambda labels\
    \ as 32-bit quantities\n      need to be updated to handle the increased length\
    \ (64 bits) of\n      labels as described in this document.  These \"unknown\"\
    \ 64-bit\n      labels could be displayed as opaque 64-bit quantities and still\n\
    \      add a lot of value for the operator (who might need to parse the\n    \
    \  label by hand).  However, an implementation that already supports\n      lambda\
    \ labels as defined in [RFC6205] can safely continue to\n      process the first\
    \ 32 bits and display the fields defined in RFC\n      6205 as before, leaving\
    \ just the second 32 bits as opaque data.\n   -  Second, a more sophisticated\
    \ upgrade to a management system would\n      fully parse the flexi-grid labels\
    \ and display them field by field\n      as described in this document.\n"
