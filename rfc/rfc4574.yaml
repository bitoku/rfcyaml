    \   media-level attribute: \"label\".  The \"label\" attribute carries a\n   pointer\
    \ to a media stream in the context of an arbitrary network\n   application that\
    \ uses SDP.  The sender of the SDP document can attach\n   the \"label\" attribute\
    \ to a particular media stream or streams.  The\n   application can then use the\
    \ provided pointer to refer to each\n   particular media stream in its context.\n"

- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   SDP is being used by a variety of distributed-over-the-network\n\
    \   applications.  These applications deal with multiple sessions being\n   described\
    \ by SDP [4] and serving multiple users or services in the\n   context of a single\
    \ application instance.  Applications of this kind\n   need a means to identify\
    \ a particular media stream across multiple\n   SDP descriptions exchanged with\
    \ different users.\n   The XCON framework is an example of a centralized conference\n\
    \   architecture that uses SDP according to the offer/answer mechanism\n   defined\
    \ in [3] to establish media streams with each of the conference\n   participants.\
    \  Additionally, XCON identifies the need to uniquely\n   identify a media stream\
    \ in terms of its role in a conference\n   regardless of its media type, transport\
    \ protocol, and media format.\n   This can be accomplished by using an external\
    \ document that points to\n   the appropriate media stream and provides information\
    \ (e.g., the\n   media stream's role in the conference) about it.  The SIP Event\n\
    \   Package for Conference State [7] defines and uses a concrete format\n   for\
    \ such external documents.\n   This specification defines the SDP [4] \"label\"\
    \ media-level attribute,\n   which provides a pointer to a media stream that is\
    \ described by an\n   'm' line in an SDP session description.\n"

  - "2.  Terminology\n   In this document, the key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"\
    REQUIRED\",\n   \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\", \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\"\
    , \"NOT\n   RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" are to be interpreted as\n\
    \   described in BCP 14, RFC 2119 [1] and indicate requirement levels for\n  \
    \ compliant implementations.\n"
- title: 3.  Motivation for the New label Attribute
  contents:
  - "3.  Motivation for the New label Attribute\n   Even though SDP and its extensions\
    \ already provide a few ways to\n   refer to a media stream, none of them is appropriate\
    \ to be used in\n   the context of external documents that may be created before\
    \ the\n   session description itself and need to be handled by automata.\n   The\
    \ 'i' SDP attribute, defined in RFC 2327 [4], can be used to label\n   media streams.\
    \  Nevertheless, values of the 'i' attribute are\n   intended for human users\
    \ and not for automata.\n   The 'mid' SDP attribute, defined in RFC 3388 [6],\
    \ can be used to\n   identify media streams as well.  Nevertheless, the scope\
    \ of 'mid' is\n   too limited to be used by applications dealing with multiple\
    \ SDP\n   sessions.  This is because values of the 'mid' attribute are\n   meaningful\
    \ in the context of a single SDP session, not in the context\n   of a broader\
    \ application (e.g., a multiparty application).\n   Another way of referring to\
    \ a media stream is by using the order of\n   the 'm' line in the SDP session\
    \ document (e.g., the 5th media stream\n   in the session description).  This\
    \ is the mechanism used in the\n   offer/answer model [3].\n   The problem with\
    \ this mechanism is that it can only be used to refer\n   to media streams in\
    \ session descriptions that exist already.  There\n   are scenarios where a static\
    \ document needs to refer, using a\n   pointer, to a media stream that will be\
    \ negotiated by SDP means and\n   created in the future.  When the media stream\
    \ is eventually created,\n   the application needs to label the media stream so\
    \ that the pointer\n   in the static document points to the proper media stream\
    \ in the\n   session description.\n"
- title: 4.  The Label Attribute
  contents:
  - "4.  The Label Attribute\n   This specification defines a new media-level value\
    \ attribute:\n   'label'.  Its formatting in SDP is described by the following\
    \ ABNF\n   [2]:\n      label-attribute    = \"a=label:\" pointer\n      pointer\
    \            = token\n      token              = 1*(token-char)\n      token-char\
    \         = %x21 / %x23-27 / %x2A-2B / %x2D-2E / %x30-39\n                   \
    \        / %x41-5A / %x5E-7E\n   The token-char and token elements are defined\
    \ in [4] but included\n   here to provide support for the implementor of this\
    \ SDP feature.\n   The 'label' attribute contains a token that is defined by an\n\
    \   application and is used in its context.  The new attribute can be\n   attached\
    \ to 'm' lines in multiple SDP documents allowing the\n   application to logically\
    \ group the media streams across SDP sessions\n   when necessary.\n"
- title: 5.  The Label Attribute in the Offer/Answer Model
  contents:
  - "5.  The Label Attribute in the Offer/Answer Model\n   This specification does\
    \ not define a means to discover whether or not\n   the peer endpoint understands\
    \ the 'label' attribute because 'label'\n   values are informative only at the\
    \ offer/answer model level.\n   At the offer/answer level, it means that the fact\
    \ that an offer does\n   not contain label attributes does not imply that the\
    \ answer should\n   not have them.  It also means that the fact that an offer\
    \ contains\n   label attributes does not imply that the answer should have them\
    \ too.\n   In addition to the basic offer/answer rule above, applications that\n\
    \   use 'label' as a pointer to media streams MUST specify its usage\n   constraints.\
    \  For example, such applications MAY mandate support for\n   'label'.  In this\
    \ case, the application will define means for\n   negotiation of the 'label' attribute\
    \ support as a part of its\n   specification.\n"
- title: 6.  Example
  contents:
  - "6.  Example\n   The following is an example of an SDP session description that\
    \ uses\n   the 'label' attribute:\n      v=0\n      o=bob 280744730 28977631 IN\
    \ IP4 host.example.com\n      s=\n      i=A Seminar on the session description\
    \ protocol\n      c=IN IP4 192.0.2.2\n      t=0 0\n      m=audio 6886 RTP/AVP\
    \ 0\n      a=label:1\n      m=audio 22334 RTP/AVP 0\n      a=label:2\n"
- title: 7.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "7.  Security Considerations\n   An attacker may attempt to add, modify, or remove\
    \ 'label' attributes\n   from a session description.  This could result in an\
    \ application\n   behaving in a non-desirable way.  So, it is strongly RECOMMENDED\
    \ that\n   integrity protection be applied to the SDP session descriptions.  For\n\
    \   session descriptions carried in SIP [5], S/MIME is the natural choice\n  \
    \ to provide such end-to-end integrity protection, as described in RFC\n   3261\
    \ [5].  Other applications MAY use a different form of integrity\n   protection.\n"
- title: 8.  IANA Considerations
  contents:
  - "8.  IANA Considerations\n   The IANA has registered the following new SDP attribute:\n\
    \   Contact name:          Orit Levin oritl@microsoft.com.\n   Attribute name:\
    \        \"label\".\n   Type of attribute:     Media level.\n   Subject to charset:\
    \    Not.\n   Purpose of attribute:  The 'label' attribute associates a media\n\
    \   stream with a label.  This label allows the media stream to be\n   referenced\
    \ by external documents.\n   Allowed attribute values:  A token.\n"
