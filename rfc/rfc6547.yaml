    \   Considered Harmful\" (RFC 3627) to Historic status to reflect the\n   updated\
    \ guidance contained in \"Using 127-Bit IPv6 Prefixes on Inter-\n   Router Links\"\
    \ (RFC 6164).  A Standards Track document supersedes an\n   informational document;\
    \ therefore, guidance provided in RFC 6164 is\n   to be followed when the two\
    \ documents are in conflict.  This document\n   links the two RFCs so that the\
    \ IETF's updated guidance on this topic\n   is clearer.\n"

- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   This document moves \"Use of /127 Prefix Length Between\
    \ Routers\n   Considered Harmful\" [RFC3627] to Historic status in accordance\
    \ with\n   RFC 2026 [RFC2026].  RFC 3627 has been superseded by \"Using 127-Bit\n\
    \   IPv6 Prefixes on Inter-Router Links\" [RFC6164].  A Standards Track\n   document\
    \ supersedes an informational document; therefore, guidance\n   provided in RFC\
    \ 6164 is to be followed when the two documents are in\n   conflict.  This may\
    \ not have been clear to casual readers who are not\n   familiar with the differences\
    \ in IETF document types.  This document\n   adds the necessary link between the\
    \ two RFCs so that users referring\n   to RFC 3627 for guidance will see that\
    \ it has been obsoleted by\n   updated guidance on the matter, thus hopefully\
    \ eliminating any\n   confusion that may be present.\n"
