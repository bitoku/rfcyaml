- title: 1.  Introduction and Motivation

  - "1.  Introduction and Motivation\n   Group communication forms an integral building\
    \ block of a wide\n   variety of applications, ranging from content broadcasting\
    \ and\n   streaming, voice and video conferencing, collaborative environments\n\
    \   and massive multiplayer gaming, up to the self-organization of\n   distributed\
    \ systems, services, or autonomous networks.  Network-layer\n   multicast support\
    \ will be needed whenever globally distributed,\n   scalable, serverless, or instantaneous\
    \ communication is required.\n   The early idea of Internet multicasting [1] soon\
    \ led to a wide\n   adoption of Deering's host group model [2].  Broadband media\
    \ delivery\n   is emerging as a typical mass scenario that demands scalability\
    \ and\n   bandwidth efficiency from multicast routing.  Although multicast\n \
    \  mobility has been a concern for about ten years [3] and has led to\n   numerous\
    \ proposals, there is as yet no generally accepted solution.\n   Multicast network\
    \ support will be of particular importance to mobile\n   environments, where users\
    \ commonly share frequency bands of limited\n   capacity.  Reception of \"infotainment\"\
    \ streams may soon require wide\n   deployment of mobile multicast services.\n\
    \   Mobility in IPv6 [4] is standardized in the Mobile IPv6 RFCs [5][6],\n   and\
    \ it addresses the scenario of network-layer changes while moving\n   between\
    \ wireless domains.  MIPv6 [5] only roughly defines multicast\n   mobility for\
    \ Mobile Nodes (MNs) using a remote subscription approach\n   or through bidirectional\
    \ tunneling via the Home Agent (HA).  Remote\n   subscription suffers from slow\
    \ handovers relying on multicast routing\n   to adapt to handovers.  Bidirectional\
    \ tunneling introduces\n   inefficient overhead and delay due to triangular forwarding,\
    \ i.e.,\n   instead of traveling on shortest paths, packets are routed through\n\
    \   the Home Agent.  Therefore, these approaches have not been optimized\n   for\
    \ a large scale deployment.  A mobile multicast service for a\n   future Internet\
    \ should provide \"close-to-optimal\" routing at\n   predictable and limited cost,\
    \ offering robustness combined with a\n   service quality compliant to real-time\
    \ media distribution.\n   Intricate multicast routing procedures are not easily\
    \ extensible to\n   satisfy the requirements for mobility.  A client subscribed\
    \ to a\n   group while performing mobility handovers requires the multicast\n\
    \   traffic to follow to its new location; a mobile source needs the\n   entire\
    \ delivery tree to comply with or to adapt to its changing\n   position.  Significant\
    \ effort has already been invested in protocol\n   designs for mobile multicast\
    \ receivers; only limited work has been\n   dedicated to multicast source mobility,\
    \ which poses the more delicate\n   problem [65].\n   In multimedia conference\
    \ scenarios, games, or collaborative\n   environments, each member commonly operates\
    \ as a receiver and as a\n   sender for multicast group communication.  In addition,\
    \ real-time\n   communication such as conversational voice or video places severe\n\
    \   temporal requirements on mobility protocols: Typical seamless\n   handover\
    \ scenarios are expected to limit disruptions or delay to less\n   than 100 -\
    \ 150 ms [7].  Jitter disturbances should not exceed 50 ms.\n   Note that 100\
    \ ms is about the duration of a spoken syllable in real-\n   time audio.  This\
    \ problem statement is intended to also be applicable\n   to a range of other\
    \ scenarios with a range of delivery requirements\n   appropriate to the general\
    \ Internet.\n   This document represents the consensus of the MobOpts Research\
    \ Group.\n   It has been reviewed by the Research Group members active in the\n\
    \   specific area of work.  In addition, this document has been\n   comprehensively\
    \ reviewed by multiple active contributors to the IETF\n   MEXT, MBONED, and PIM\
    \ Working Groups.\n"
- title: 1.1.  Document Scope
  contents:
  - "1.1.  Document Scope\n   This document defines the problem scope for multicast\
    \ mobility\n   management, which may be elaborated in future work.  It is subdivided\n\
    \   to present the various challenges according to their originating\n   aspects,\
    \ and identifies existing proposals and major bibliographic\n   references.\n\
    \   When considering multicast node mobility, the network layer is\n   complemented\
    \ by some wireless access technology.  Two basic scenarios\n   are of interest:\
    \ single-hop mobility (shown in Figure 1.a) and multi-\n   hop mobility (shown\
    \ in Figure 1.b).  Single-hop mobility is the focus\n   of this document, which\
    \ coincides with the perspective of MIPv6 [5].\n   The key issues of mobile multicast\
    \ membership control and the\n   interplay of mobile and multicast routing will\
    \ be illustrated using\n   this simple scenario.\n   Multi-hop network mobility\
    \ is a subsidiary scenario.  All major\n   aspects are inherited from the single-hop\
    \ problem, while additional\n   complexity is incurred from traversing a mobile\
    \ cloud.  This may be\n   solved by either encapsulation or flooding ([8] provides\
    \ a general\n   overview).  Specific issues arising from (nested) tunneling or\n\
    \   flooding, especially the preservation of address transparency,\n   require\
    \ treatment analogous to MIPv6.\n                                       +------+\

- title: 2.1.  General Issues
  contents:
  - "2.1.  General Issues\n   Multicast mobility is a generic term, which subsumes\
    \ a collection of\n   distinct functions.  First, the multicast communication\
    \ is divided\n   into Any Source Multicast (ASM) [2] and Source-Specific Multicast\n\
    \   (SSM) [9][10].  Second, the roles of senders and receivers are\n   distinct\
    \ and asymmetric.  Both may individually be mobile.  Their\n   interaction is\
    \ facilitated by a multicast routing protocol such as\n   the Distance Vector\
    \ Multicast Routing Protocol (DVMRP) [11], the\n   Protocol Independent Multicast\
    \ - Sparse Mode / Source-Specific\n   Multicast (PIM-SM/SSM) [12][13], the Bidirectional\
    \ PIM [14], or the\n   inter-domain multicast prefix advertisements via Multiprotocol\n\
    \   Extensions for BGP-4 (MBGP) [15].  IPv6 clients interact using the\n   multicast\
    \ listener discovery protocol (MLD and MLDv2) [16][17].\n   Any solution for multicast\
    \ mobility needs to take all of these\n   functional blocks into account.  It\
    \ should enable seamless continuity\n   of multicast sessions when moving from\
    \ one IPv6 subnet to another.\n   It is desired to preserve the multicast nature\
    \ of packet distribution\n   and approximate optimal routing.  It should support\
    \ per-flow handover\n   for multicast traffic because the properties and designations\
    \ of\n   flows can be distinct.  Such distinctions may result from differing\n\
    \   Quality-of-Service (QoS) / real-time requirements, but may also be\n   caused\
    \ by network conditions that may differ for different groups.\n   The host group\
    \ model extends the capability of the network-layer\n   unicast service.  In common\
    \ with the architecture of fixed networks,\n   multicast mobility management should\
    \ transparently utilize or\n   smoothly extend the unicast functions of MIPv6\
    \ [5], its security\n   extensions [6][18], its expediting schemes FMIPv6 [19]\
    \ and\n   Hierarchical Mobile IPv6 Environment (HMIPv6) [20], its context\n  \
    \ transfer protocols [21], its multihoming capabilities [22][23],\n   emerging\
    \ protocols like PMIPv6 [62], or future developments.  From\n   the perspective\
    \ of an integrated mobility architecture, it is\n   desirable to avoid multicast-specific\
    \ as well as unicast-restricted\n   solutions, whenever general approaches can\
    \ be derived that can\n   jointly support unicast and multicast.\n   Multicast\
    \ routing dynamically adapts to the network topology at the\n   locations of the\
    \ sender(s) and receiver(s) participating in a\n   multicast session, which then\
    \ may change under mobility.  However,\n   depending on the topology and the protocol\
    \ in use, current multicast\n   routing protocols may require a time close to\
    \ seconds to converge\n   following a change in receiver or sender location. \
    \ This is far too\n   slow to support seamless handovers for interactive or real-time\
    \ media\n   sessions.  The actual temporal behavior strongly depends on the\n\
    \   multicast routing protocol in use, the configuration of routers, and\n   on\
    \ the geometry of the current distribution tree.  A mobility scheme\n   that readjusts\
    \ routing, i.e., partially changes or fully reconstructs\n   a multicast tree,\
    \ is forced to comply with the time scale for\n   protocol convergence.  Specifically,\
    \ it needs to consider a possible\n   rapid movement of the mobile node, as this\
    \ may occur at much higher\n   rates than common protocol state updates.\n   The\
    \ mobility of hosts using IP multicast can impact the service\n   presented to\
    \ the higher-layer protocols.  IP-layer multicast packet\n   distribution is an\
    \ unreliable service that is bound to a\n   connectionless transport service.\
    \  Where applications are sensitive\n   to packet loss or jitter, countermeasures\
    \ need to be performed (loss\n   recovery, content recoding, concealment, etc.)\
    \ by the multicast\n   transport or application.  Mobile multicast handovers should\
    \ not\n   introduce significant additional packet drops.  Due to statelessness,\n\
    \   the bi-casting of multicast flows does not cause degradations at the\n   transport\
    \ layer, and applications should implement mechanisms to\n   detect and correctly\
    \ respond to duplicate datagrams.  Nevertheless,\n   individual application programs\
    \ may not be robust with respect to\n   repeated reception of duplicate streams.\n\
    \   IP multicast applications can be designed to adapt the multicast\n   stream\
    \ to prevailing network conditions (adapting the sending rate to\n   the level\
    \ of congestion, adaptive tuning of clients in response to\n   measured delay,\
    \ dynamic suppression of feedback messages, etc.).  An\n   adaptive application\
    \ may also use more than one multicast group\n   (e.g., layered multicast in which\
    \ a client selects a set of multicast\n   groups based on perceived available\
    \ network capacity).  A mobility\n   handover may temporarily disrupt the operation\
    \ of these higher-layer\n   functions.  The handover can invalidate assumptions\
    \ about the\n   forwarding path (e.g., acceptable delivery rate, round-trip delay),\n\
    \   which could impact an application and level of network traffic.  Such\n  \
    \ effects need to be considered in the design of multicast applications\n   and\
    \ in the design of network-layer mobility.  Specifically, mobility\n   mechanisms\
    \ need to be robust to transient packet loss that may result\n   from invalid\
    \ path expectations following a handover of an MN to a\n   different network.\n\
    \   Group addresses, in general, are location transparent, even though\n   they\
    \ may be scoped and methods can embed unicast prefixes or\n   Rendezvous Point\
    \ addresses [24].  The addresses of sources\n   contributing to a multicast session\
    \ are interpreted by the routing\n   infrastructure and by receiver applications,\
    \ which frequently are\n   aware of source addresses.  Multicast therefore inherits\
    \ the mobility\n   address duality problem of MIPv6 for source addresses: addresses\n\
    \   being a logical node identifier, i.e., the home address (HoA) on the\n   one\
    \ hand, and a topological locator, the care-of address (CoA), on\n   the other.\
    \  At the network layer, the elements that comprise the\n   delivery tree, i.e.,\
    \ multicast senders, forwarders, and receivers,\n   need to carefully account\
    \ for address duality issues, e.g., by using\n   binding caches, extended multicast\
    \ states, or signaling.\n   Multicast sources, in general, operate decoupled from\
    \ their receivers\n   in the following sense: a multicast source sends packets\
    \ to a group\n   of receivers that are unknown at the network layer and thus operates\n\
    \   without a feedback channel.  It neither has means to inquire about\n   the\
    \ properties of its delivery trees, nor the ability to learn about\n   the network-layer\
    \ state of its receivers.  In the event of an inter-\n   tree handover, a mobile\
    \ multicast source therefore is vulnerable to\n   losing connectivity to receivers\
    \ without noticing.  (Appendix A\n   describes implicit source notification approaches).\
    \  Applying a MIPv6\n   mobility binding update or return routability procedure\
    \ will\n   similarly break the semantic of a receiver group remaining\n   unidentified\
    \ by the source and thus cannot be applied in unicast\n   analogy.\n   Despite\
    \ the complexity of the requirements, multicast mobility\n   management should\
    \ seek lightweight solutions with easy deployment.\n   Realistic, sample deployment\
    \ scenarios and architectures should be\n   provided in future solution documents.\n"

    \ multicast groups under subscription\n        may not be forwarded to it, e.g.,\
    \ groups may be scoped or\n        administratively prohibited.  This means that\
    \ current\n        distribution trees for the desired groups may only be re-joined\n\
    \        at a (possibly large) routing distance.\n      o The new network may\
    \ not be multicast-enabled or the specific\n        multicast service may be unavailable,\
    \ e.g., unsupported or\n        prohibited.  This means that current distribution\
    \ trees for the\n        desired groups need to be re-joined at a large routing\
    \ distance\n        by (re-)establishing a tunnel to a multicast-enabled network\n\
    \        node.\n   The problem of achieving seamless multicast listener handovers\
    \ is\n   thus threefold:\n      o Ensure multicast reception, even in visited\
    \ networks, without\n        appropriate multicast support.\n      o Minimize\
    \ multicast forwarding delay to provide seamless and fast\n        handovers for\
    \ real-time services.  Dependent on Layer 2 (L2) and\n        Layer 3 (L3) handover\
    \ performance, the time available for\n        multicast mobility operations is\
    \ typically bound by the total\n        handover time left after IPv6 connectivity\
    \ is regained.  In\n        real-time scenarios, this may be significantly less\
    \ than 100 ms.\n      o Minimize packet loss and reordering that result from multicast\n\
    \        handover management.\n   Moreover, in many wireless regimes, it is also\
    \ desirable to minimize\n   multicast-related signaling to preserve the limited\
    \ resources of\n   battery-powered mobile devices and the constrained transmission\n\
    \   capacities of the networks.  This may lead to a desire to restrict\n   MLD\
    \ queries towards the MN.  Multihomed MNs may ensure smooth\n   handoffs by using\
    \ a \"make-before-break\" approach, which requires a\n   per-interface subscription,\
    \ facilitated by an MLD JOIN operating on a\n   pre-selected IPv6 interface.\n\
    \   Encapsulation on the path between the upstream router and the\n   receiver\
    \ may result in MTU size conflicts, since path-MTU discovery\n   is often not\
    \ supported for multicast and can reduce scalability in\n   networks with many\
    \ different MTU sizes or introduce potential denial-\n   of-service vulnerabilities\
    \ (since the originating addresses of ICMPv6\n   messages cannot be verified for\
    \ multicast).  In the absence of\n   fragmentation at tunnel entry points, this\
    \ may prevent the group from\n   being forwarded to the destination.\n"

    \ either forms the root of a\n   source-specific shortest path tree (SPT), distributing\
    \ data towards a\n   rendezvous point (RP) or receivers, or it forwards data directly\
    \ down\n   a shared tree, e.g., via encapsulated PIM Register messages, or using\n\
    \   bidirectional PIM routing.  Native forwarding along source-specific\n   delivery\
    \ trees will be bound to the source's topological network\n   address, due to\
    \ reverse path forwarding (RPF) checks.  A mobile\n   multicast source moving\
    \ to a new subnetwork is only able to either\n   inject data into a previously\
    \ established delivery tree, which may be\n   a rendezvous-point-based shared\
    \ tree, or to (re-)initiate the\n   construction of a multicast distribution tree\
    \ for its new network\n   location.  In the latter case, the mobile sender will\
    \ have to proceed\n   without knowing whether the new tree has regained ability\
    \ to forward\n   traffic to the group, due to the decoupling of sender and receivers.\n\
    \   A mobile multicast source must therefore provide address transparency\n  \
    \ at two layers: To comply with RPF checks, it has to use an address\n   within\
    \ the source field of the IPv6 basic header, which is in\n   topological agreement\
    \ with the employed multicast distribution tree.\n   For application transparency,\
    \ the logical node identifier, commonly\n   the HoA, must be presented as the\
    \ packet source address to the\n   transport layer at the receiver side.\n   The\
    \ address transparency and temporal handover constraints pose major\n   problems\
    \ for route-optimizing mobility solutions.  Additional issues\n   arise from possible\
    \ packet loss and from multicast scoping.  A mobile\n   source away from home\
    \ must respect scoping restrictions that arise\n   from its home and its visited\
    \ location [5].\n   Intra-domain multicast routing may allow the use of shared\
    \ trees that\n   can reduce mobility-related complexity.  A static rendezvous\
    \ point\n   may allow a mobile source to continuously send data to the group by\n\
    \   encapsulating packets to the RP with its previous topologically\n   correct\
    \ or home source address.  Intra-domain mobility is\n   transparently provided\
    \ by bidirectional shared domain-spanning trees,\n   when using bidirectional\
    \ PIM, eliminating the need for tunneling to\n   the corresponding RP (in contrast\
    \ to IPv4, IPv6 ASM multicast groups\n   are associated with a specific RP/RPs).\n\
    \   Issues arise in inter-domain multicast, whenever notification of\n   source\
    \ addresses is required between distributed instances of shared\n   trees.  A\
    \ new CoA acquired after a mobility handover will necessarily\n   be subject to\
    \ inter-domain record exchange.  In the presence of an\n   embedded rendezvous\
    \ point address [24], e.g., the primary rendezvous\n   point for inter-domain\
    \ PIM-SM will be globally appointed, and a newly\n   attached mobile source can\
    \ contact the RP without prior signaling\n   (like a new source) and transmit\
    \ data in the PIM register tunnel.\n   Multicast route optimization (e.g., PIM\
    \ \"shortcuts\") will require\n   multicast routing protocol operations equivalent\
    \ to serving a new\n   source.\n"

  contents:
  - "2.3.2.  Source-Specific Multicast Mobility\n   Source-Specific Multicast has\
    \ been designed for multicast senders\n   with static source addresses.  The source\
    \ addresses in a client\n   subscription to an SSM group is directly used to route\n\
    \   identification.  Any SSM subscriber is thus forced to know the\n   topological\
    \ address of the contributor to the group it wishes to\n   join.  The SSM source\
    \ identification becomes invalid when the\n   topological source address changes\
    \ under mobility.  Hence, client\n   implementations of SSM source filtering must\
    \ be MIPv6 aware in the\n   sense that a logical source identifier (HoA) is correctly\
    \ mapped to\n   its current topological correspondent (CoA).\n   As a consequence,\
    \ source mobility for SSM requires a conceptual\n   treatment beyond the problem\
    \ scope of mobile ASM.  A listener\n   subscribes to an (S,G) channel membership\
    \ and routers establish an\n   (S,G)-state shortest path tree rooted at source\
    \ S; therefore, any\n   change of source addresses under mobility requires state\
    \ updates at\n   all routers on the upstream path and at all receivers in the\
    \ group.\n   On source handover, a new SPT needs to be established that will share\n\
    \   paths with the previous SPT, e.g., at the receiver side.  As the\n   principle\
    \ of multicast decoupling of a sender from its receivers\n   holds for SSM, the\
    \ client updates needed for switching trees become a\n   severe burden.\n   An\
    \ SSM listener may subscribe to or exclude any specific multicast\n   source and\
    \ thereby wants to rely on the topological correctness of\n   network operations.\
    \  The SSM design permits trust in equivalence to\n   the correctness of unicast\
    \ routing tables.  Any SSM mobility solution\n   should preserve this degree of\
    \ confidence.  Binding updates for SSM\n   sources thus should have to prove address\
    \ correctness in the unicast\n   routing sense, which is equivalent to binding\
    \ update security with a\n   correspondent node in MIPv6 [5].\n   The above methods\
    \ could add significant complexity to a solution for\n   robust SSM mobility,\
    \ which needs to converge to optimal routes and,\n   for efficiency, is desired\
    \ to avoid data encapsulation.  Like ASM,\n   handover management is a time-critical\
    \ operation.  The routing\n   distance between subsequent points of attachment,\
    \ the \"step size\" of\n   the mobile from previous to next designated router,\
    \ may serve as an\n   appropriate measure of complexity [25][26].\n   Finally,\
    \ Source-Specific Multicast has been designed as a lightweight\n   approach to\
    \ group communication.  In adding mobility management, it\n   is desirable to\
    \ preserve the leanness of SSM by minimizing additional\n   signaling overhead.\n"

  - "2.4.  Deployment Issues\n   IP multicast deployment, in general, has been slow\
    \ over the past 15\n   years, even though all major router vendors and operating\
    \ systems\n   offer implementations that support multicast [27].  While many\n\
    \   (walled) domains or enterprise networks operate point-to-multipoint\n   services,\
    \ IP multicast roll-out is currently limited in public inter-\n   domain scenarios\
    \ [28].  A dispute arose on the appropriate layer,\n   where group communication\
    \ service should reside, and the focus of the\n   research community turned towards\
    \ application-layer multicast.  This\n   debate on \"efficiency versus deployment\
    \ complexity\" now overlaps the\n   mobile multicast domain [29].  Garyfalos and\
    \ Almeroth [30] derived\n   from fairly generic principles that when mobility\
    \ is introduced, the\n   performance gap between IP- and application-layer multicast\
    \ widens in\n   different metrics up to a factor of four.\n   Facing deployment\
    \ complexity, it is desirable that any solution for\n   mobile multicast does\

    \ scheme should preferably be\n   handled at edge nodes, preserving a mobility-agnostic\

    \ distribution services such as\n   Digital Video Broadcasting for Handhelds (DVB-H)\
    \ [31][32] or IPTV\n   develop a strong business case for portable IP-based devices.\
    \  As IP\n   mobility becomes an important service and as efficient link\n   utilization\

  - "3.  Characteristics of Multicast Routing Trees under Mobility\n   Multicast distribution\
    \ trees have been studied from a focus of\n   network efficiency.  Grounded on\
    \ empirical observations, Chuang and\n   Sirbu [33] proposed a scaling power-law\
    \ for the total number of links\n   in a multicast shortest path tree with m receivers\
    \ (proportional to\n   m^k).  The authors consistently identified the scale factor\
    \ to attain\n   the independent constant k = 0.8.  The validity of such universal,\n\
    \   heavy-tailed distribution suggests that multicast shortest path trees\n  \
    \ are of self-similar nature with many nodes of small, but few of\n   higher degrees.\
    \  Trees consequently would be shaped tall rather than\n   wide.\n   Subsequent\
    \ empirical and analytical work [34][35] debated the\n   applicability of the\
    \ Chuang and Sirbu scaling law.  Van Mieghem et\n   al. [34] proved that the proposed\
    \ power law cannot hold for an\n   increasing Internet or very large multicast\
    \ groups, but is indeed\n   applicable for moderate receiver numbers and the current\
    \ Internet\n   size of N = 10^5 core nodes.  Investigating self-similarity, Janic\n\
    \   and Van Mieghem [36] semi-empirically substantiated that multicast\n   shortest\
    \ path trees in the Internet can be modeled with reasonable\n   accuracy by uniform\
    \ recursive trees (URTs) [37], provided m remains\n   small compared to N.\n \
    \  The mobility perspective on shortest path trees focuses on their\n   alteration,\
    \ i.e., the degree of topological changes induced by\n   movement.  For receivers,\
    \ and more interestingly for sources, this\n   may serve as a characteristic measure\
    \ of the routing complexity.\n   Mobile listeners moving to neighboring networks\
    \ will only alter tree\n   branches extending over a few hops.  Source-specific\
    \ multicast trees\n   subsequently generated from source handover steps are not\n\
    \   independent, but highly correlated.  They most likely branch to\n   identical\
    \ receivers at one or several intersection points.  By the\n   self-similar nature,\
    \ the persistent sub-trees (of previous and next\n   distribution tree), rooted\
    \ at any such intersection point, exhibit\n   again the scaling law behavior,\
    \ are tall-shaped with nodes of mainly\n   low degree and thus likely to coincide.\
    \  Tree alterations under\n   mobility have been studied in [26], both analytically\
    \ and by\n   simulations.  It was found that even in large networks and for\n\
    \   moderate receiver numbers more than 80% of the multicast router\n   states\

  - "4.1.  General Background\n   Scalable group data distribution has the highest\
    \ potential in edge\n   networks, where large numbers of end systems reside. \
    \ Consequently,\n   it is not surprising that most LAN network access technologies\n\
    \   natively support point-to-multipoint or multicast services.  Wireless\n  \
    \ access technologies inherently support broadcast/multicast at L2 and\n   operate\
    \ on a shared medium with limited frequency and bandwidth.\n   Several aspects\
    \ need consideration: First, dissimilar network access\n   radio technologies\
    \ cause distinct group traffic transmissions.  There\n   are:\n      o connection-less\
    \ link services of a broadcast type, which mostly\n        are bound to limited\
    \ reliability;\n      o connection-oriented link services of a point-to-multipoint\
    \ type,\n        which require more complex control and frequently exhibit\n \
    \       reduced efficiency;\n      o connection-oriented link services of a broadcast\
    \ type, which are\n        restricted to unidirectional data transmission.\n \
    \  In addition, multicast may be distributed via multiple point-to-point\n   unicast\
    \ links without the use of a dedicated multipoint radio\n   channel.  A fundamental\
    \ difference between unicast and group\n   transmission arises from power management.\
    \  Some radio technologies\n   adjust transmit power to be as small as possible\
    \ based on link-layer\n   feedback from the receiver, which is not done in multipoint\
    \ mode.\n   They consequently incur a \"multicast tax\", making multicast less\n\
    \   efficient than unicast unless the number of receivers is larger than\n   some\
    \ threshold.\n   Second, point-to-multipoint service activation at the network\
    \ access\n   layer requires a mapping mechanism from network-layer requests. \
    \ This\n   function is commonly achieved by L3 awareness, i.e., IGMP/MLD\n   snooping\
    \ [70] or proxy [38], which occasionally is complemented by\n   Multicast VLAN\
    \ Registration (MVR).  MVR allows sharing of a single\n   multicast IEEE 802.1Q\
    \ Virtual LAN in the network, while subscribers\n   remain in separate VLANs.\
    \  This L2 separation of multicast and\n   unicast traffic can be employed as\
    \ a workaround for point-to-point\n   link models to establish a common multicast\
    \ link.\n   Third, an address mapping between the layers is needed for common\n\
    \   group identification.  Address resolution schemes depend on framing\n   details\
    \ for the technologies in use, but commonly cause a significant\n   address overlap\
    \ at the lower layer (i.e., more than one IP multicast\n   group address is sent\
    \ using the same L2 address).\n"

    \ point-to-point link model [40] is\n   recommended in the IPv6 Convergence Sublayer\

    \ point-to-point\n   link model conflicts with a consistent group distribution\
    \ at the IP\n   layer when using a shared medium (cf. Section 4.1 for MVR as a\n\
    \   workaround).\n   To invoke a multipoint data channel, the base station assigns\
    \ a\n   common CID to all Subscriber Stations in the group.  An IPv6\n   multicast\

    \ [43].\n   A Subscriber Station multicasts IP packets to a Base Station as a\n\
    \   point-to-point unicast stream.  When the IPv6 CS is used, these are\n   forwarded\

    \ distinguish multicast from\n   unicast streams at the link layer.\n   Multicast\
    \ services have the following characteristics:\n      o Multicast CIDs are unidirectional\
    \ and available only in the\n        downlink direction.  Thus, a native broadcast-type\
    \ forwarding\n        model is not available.\n      o The mapping of multicast\
    \ addresses to CIDs needs\n        standardization, since different entities (Access\
    \ Router, Base\n        Station) may have to perform the mapping.\n      o CID\

    \ datagrams\n   over Generic Tunneling Protocol (GTP) (with multipoint TID) over\n\
    \   local IP multicast.\n   The 3GPP MBMS has the following characteristics:\n\
    \      o There is no immediate Layer 2 source-to-destination transition,\n   \
    \     resulting in transit of all multicast traffic at the GGSN.\n      o As GGSNs\

    \ which on the routing layer operates very\n   similar to MBMS.  In both 3GPP\
    \ and 3GPP2, multicast can be sent using\n   either point-to-point (PTP) or point-to-multipoint\

    \ [56]:\n      o Bidirectional Tunneling, in which the mobile node tunnels all\n\
    \        multicast data via its home agent.  This fundamental multicast\n    \
    \    solution hides all movement and results in static multicast\n        trees.\
    \  It may be employed transparently by mobile multicast\n        listeners and\
    \ sources, at the cost of triangular routing and\n        possibly significant\
    \ performance degradation from widely spanned\n        data tunnels.\n      o\
    \ Remote Subscription forces the mobile node to re-initiate\n        multicast\
    \ distribution following handover, e.g., by submitting\n        an MLD listener\
    \ report to the subnet where a receiver attaches.\n        This approach of tree\
    \ discontinuation relies on multicast\n        dynamics to adapt to network changes.\
    \  It not only results in\n        significant service disruption but leads to\
    \ mobility-driven\n        changes of source addresses, and thus cannot support\
    \ session\n        persistence under multicast source mobility.\n      o Agent-based\
    \ solutions attempt to balance between the previous\n        two mechanisms. \
    \ Static agents typically act as local tunneling\n        proxies, allowing for\
    \ some inter-agent handover when the mobile\n        node moves.  A decelerated\
    \ inter-tree handover, i.e., \"tree\n        walking\", will be the outcome of\
    \ agent-based multicast mobility,\n        where some extra effort is needed to\
    \ sustain session persistence\n        through address transparency of mobile\
    \ sources.\n   MIPv6 [5] introduces bidirectional tunneling as well as remote\n\
    \   subscription as minimal standard solutions.  Various publications\n   suggest\
    \ utilizing remote subscription for listener mobility only,\n   while advising\
    \ bidirectional tunneling as the solution for source\n   mobility.  Such an approach\
    \ avoids the \"tunnel convergence\" or\n   \"avalanche\" problem [56], which refers\
    \ to the responsibility of the\n   home agent to multiply and encapsulate packets\
    \ for many receivers of\n   the same group, even if they are located within the\
    \ same subnetwork.\n   However, this suffers from the drawback that multicast\

    \ for wireless links, where performance may be improved\n   by carefully tuning\
    \ the Query Interval and other variables.  Some\n   vendors have optimized performance\
    \ by implementing a listener node\n   table at the access router that can eliminate\
    \ the need for query\n   timeouts when receiving leave messages (explicit receiver\
    \ tracking).\n   An MN operating predictive handover, e.g., using FMIPv6, may\n\
    \   accelerate multicast service termination when leaving the previous\n   network\
    \ by submitting an early Done message before handoff.  MLD\n   router querying\
    \ will allow the multicast forwarding state to be\n   restored in the case of\
    \ an erroneous prediction (i.e., an anticipated\n   move to a network that has\

    \ Reconstruction of Distribution Trees.  Several authors have\n        proposed\

- title: 5.3.2.  Source-Specific Multicast Mobility Approaches
  contents:
  - "5.3.2.  Source-Specific Multicast Mobility Approaches\n   The shared tree approach\
    \ of [72] has been extended to support SSM\n   mobility by introducing the HoA\
    \ address record to the Mobility-aware\n   Rendezvous Points.  The MRPs operate\
    \ using extended multicast routing\n   tables that simultaneously hold the HoA\
    \ and CoA and thus can\n   logically identify the appropriate distribution tree.\
    \  Mobility thus\n   may reintroduce the concept of rendezvous points to SSM routing.\n\
    \   Approaches for reconstructing SPTs in SSM rely on a client\n   notification\
    \ to establish new router state.  They also need to\n   preserve address transparency\
    \ for the client.  Thaler [75] proposed\n   introducing a binding cache and providing\
    \ source address transparency\n   analogous to MIPv6 unicast communication.  Initial\
    \ session\n   announcements and changes of source addresses are distributed\n\
    \   periodically to clients via an additional multicast control tree\n   rooted\
    \ at the home agent.  Source tree handovers are then activated\n   on listener\
    \ requests.\n   Jelger and Noel [76] suggest handover improvements employing anchor\n\
    \   points within the source network, supporting continuous data\n   reception\
    \ during client-initiated handovers.  Client updates are\n   triggered out of\
    \ band, e.g., by Source Demand Routing (SDR) / Session\n   Announcement Protocol\
    \ (SAP) [77].  Receiver-oriented tree\n   construction in SSM thus remains unsynchronized\
    \ with source\n   handovers.\n   To address the synchronization problem at the\
    \ routing layer, several\n   proposals have focused on direct modification of\
    \ the distribution\n   trees.  A recursive scheme may use loose unicast source\
    \ routes with\n   branch points, based on a multicast Hop-by-Hop protocol.  Vida\
    \ et al.\n   [78] optimized SPT for a moving source on the path between the source\n\
    \   and first branching point.  O'Neill [79] suggested a scheme to\n   overcome\
    \ RPF check failures that originate from multicast source\n   address changes\
    \ with a rendezvous point scenario by introducing\n   extended routing information,\
    \ which accompanies data in a Hop-by-Hop\n   option \"RPF redirect\" header. \
    \ The Tree Morphing approach of Schmidt\n   and Waehlisch [80] used source routing\
    \ to extend the root of a\n   previously established SPT, thereby injecting router\
    \ state updates in\n   a Hop-by-Hop option header.  Using extended RPF checks,\
    \ the elongated\n   tree autonomously initiates shortcuts and smoothly reduces\
    \ to a new\n   SPT rooted at the relocated source.  An enhanced version of this\n\
    \   protocol abandoned the initial source routing and could be proved to\n   comply\
    \ with rapid source movement [81].  Lee et al. [82] introduced a\n   state-update\
    \ mechanism for reusing major parts of established\n   multicast trees.  The authors\
    \ start from an initially established\n   distribution state, centered at the\
    \ mobile source's home agent.  A\n   mobile source leaving its home network will\
    \ signal a multicast\n   forwarding state update on the path to its home agent\
    \ and,\n   subsequently, distribution states according to the mobile source's\n\
    \   new CoA along the previous distribution tree.  Multicast data is then\n  \
    \ intended to flow natively using triangular routes via the elongation\n   and\
    \ an updated tree centered on the home agent.  Based on Host\n   Identity Protocol\
    \ identifiers, Kovacshazi and Vida [83] introduce\n   multicast routing states\
    \ that remain independent of IP addresses.\n   Drawing upon a similar scaling\
    \ law argument, parts of these states\n   may then be reused after source address\
    \ changes.\n"

    \ e.g., to use/avoid a specific\n   network, minimize monetary cost, etc., rather\
    \ than one that only\n   minimizes the routing cost.  Consequently, AAA bindings\
    \ may need to\n   be considered when performing context transfer.\n   Admission\
    \ control issues may arise when new CoA source addresses are\n   introduced to\
    \ SSM channels [84].  Due to lack of feedback, the\n   admission [85] and binding\
    \ updates [86] of mobile multicast sources\n   require autonomously verifiable\
    \ authentication.  This can be achieved\n   by, for instance, Cryptographically\
    \ Generated Addresses (CGAs).\n   Modification to IETF protocols (e.g., routing,\
    \ membership, session\n   announcement, and control) as well as the introduction\
    \ of new\n   entities, e.g., multicast mobility agents, can introduce security\n\
    \   vulnerabilities and require consideration of issues such as\n   authentication\
    \ of network entities, methods to mitigate denial of\n   service (in terms of\
    \ unwanted network traffic, unnecessary\n   consumption of router/host resources\
    \ and router/host state/buffers).\n   Future solutions must therefore analyze\
    \ and address the security\n   implications of supporting mobile multicast.\n"

  - "7.  Summary and Future Steps\n   This document is intended to provide a basis\
    \ for the future design of\n   mobile IPv6 multicast methods and protocols by:\n\
    \      o providing a structured overview of the problem space that\n        multicast\
    \ and mobility jointly generate at the IPv6 layer;\n      o referencing the implications\
    \ and constraints arising from lower\n        and upper layers and from deployment;\n\
    \      o briefly surveying conceptual ideas of currently available\n        solutions;\n\
    \      o including a comprehensive bibliographic reference base.\n   It is recommended\
    \ that future steps towards extending mobility\n   services to multicast proceed\
    \ to first solve the following problems:\n      1. Ensure seamless multicast reception\
    \ during handovers, meeting\n         the requirements of mobile IPv6 nodes and\
    \ networks.  Thereby\n         addressing the problems of home subscription without\
    \ n-tunnels,\n         as well as native multicast reception in those visited\n\
    \         networks, which offer a group communication service.\n      2. Integrate\
    \ multicast listener support into unicast mobility\n         management schemes\
    \ and architectural entities to define a\n         consistent mobility service\
    \ architecture, providing equal\n         support for unicast and multicast communication.\n\
    \      3. Provide basic multicast source mobility by designing address\n     \
    \    duality management at end nodes.\n"
- title: Appendix A.  Implicit Source Notification Options
  contents:
  - "Appendix A.  Implicit Source Notification Options\n   An IP multicast source\
    \ transmits data to a group of receivers without\n   requiring any explicit feedback\
    \ from the group.  Sources therefore\n   are unaware at the network layer of whether\
    \ any receivers have\n   subscribed to the group, and unconditionally send multicast\
    \ packets\n   that propagate in the network to the first-hop router (often known\
    \ in\n   PIM as the designated router).  There have been attempts to\n   implicitly\
    \ obtain information about the listening group members,\n   e.g., extending an\
    \ IGMP/MLD querier to inform the source of the\n   existence of subscribed receivers.\
    \  Multicast Source Notification of\n   Interest Protocol (MSNIP) [87] was such\
    \ a suggested method that\n   allowed a multicast source to query the upstream\
    \ designated router.\n   However, this work did not progress within the IETF mboned\
    \ working\n   group and was terminated by the IETF.\n   Multicast sources may\
    \ also be controlled at the session or transport\n   layer using end-to-end control\
    \ protocols.  A majority of real-time\n   applications employ the Real-time Transport\
    \ Protocol (RTP) [88].  The\n   accompanying control protocol, RTP Control Protocol\
    \ (RTCP), allows\n   receivers to report information about multicast group membership\
    \ and\n   associated performance data.  In multicast, the RTCP reports are\n \
    \  submitted to the same group and thus may be monitored by the source\n   to\
    \ monitor, manage and control multicast group operations.  RFC 2326,\n   the Real\
    \ Time Streaming Protocol (RTSP), provides session layer\n   control that may\
    \ be used to control a multicast source.  However,\n   RTCP and RTSP information\
    \ is intended for end-to-end control and is\n   not necessarily visible at the\
    \ network layer.  Application designers\n   may chose to implement any appropriate\
    \ control plane for their\n   multicast applications (e.g., reliable multicast\
    \ transport\n   protocols), and therefore a network-layer mobility mechanism must\
    \ not\n   assume the presence of a specific transport or session protocol.\n"
