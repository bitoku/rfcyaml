  - "Abstract\n   The Network Time Protocol (NTP), as described in RFC 5905, states\n\
    \   that NTP packets should be authenticated by appending NTP data to a\n   128-bit\
    \ key and hashing the result with MD5 to obtain a 128-bit tag.\n   This document\
    \ deprecates MD5-based authentication, which is\n   considered too weak, and recommends\
    \ the use of AES-CMAC as described\n   in RFC 4493 as a replacement.\n"

- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   The Network Time Protocol [RFC5905] states that NTP packets\
    \ should be\n   authenticated by appending NTP data to a 128-bit key and hashing\
    \ the\n   result with MD5 to obtain a 128-bit tag.  This document deprecates\n\
    \   MD5-based authentication, which is considered too weak, and\n   recommends\
    \ the use of AES-CMAC [RFC4493] as a replacement.\n"
- title: 1.1.  Requirements Language
  contents:
  - "1.1.  Requirements Language\n   The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\"\
    , \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"\
    NOT RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and\n   \"OPTIONAL\" in this document are to be interpreted\
    \ as described in\n   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear\
    \ in all\n   capitals, as shown here.\n"
- title: 2.  Deprecating the Use of MD5
  contents:
  - "2.  Deprecating the Use of MD5\n   RFC 5905 [RFC5905] defines how the MD5 digest\
    \ algorithm described in\n   RFC 1321 [RFC1321] can be used as a Message Authentication\
    \ Code (MAC)\n   for authenticating NTP packets.  However, as discussed in [BCK]\
    \ and\n   RFC 6151 [RFC6151], this is not a secure MAC and therefore MUST be\n\
    \   deprecated.\n"
- title: 3.  Replacement Recommendation
  contents:
  - "3.  Replacement Recommendation\n   If NTP authentication is implemented, then\
    \ AES-CMAC as specified in\n   RFC 4493 [RFC4493] MUST be computed over all fields\
    \ in the NTP header\n   and any extension fields that are present in the NTP packet\
    \ as\n   described in RFC 5905 [RFC5905].  The MAC key for NTP MUST be an\n  \
    \ AES-128 key that is 128 bits in length, and the resulting MAC tag\n   MUST be\
    \ at least 128 bits in length, as stated in Section 2.4 of RFC\n   4493 [RFC4493].\
    \  NTP makes this transition possible as it supports\n   algorithm agility as\
    \ described in Section 2.1 of RFC 7696 [RFC7696].\n   The hosts that wish to use\
    \ NTP authentication share a symmetric key\n   out of band.  So they MUST implement\
    \ AES-CMAC and share the\n   corresponding symmetric key.  A symmetric key is\
    \ a triplet of ID,\n   type (e.g., MD5 and AES-CMAC) and the key itself.  All\
    \ three have to\n   match in order to successfully authenticate packets between\
    \ two\n   hosts.  Old implementations that don't support AES-CMAC will not\n \
    \  accept and will not send packets authenticated with such a key.\n"
- title: 4.  Motivation
  contents:
  - "4.  Motivation\n   AES-CMAC is recommended for the following reasons:\n   1.\
    \  It is an IETF specification that is supported in many open source\n       implementations.\n\
    \   2.  It is immune to nonce-reuse vulnerabilities (e.g., [Joux])\n       because\
    \ it does not use a nonce.\n   3.  It has fine performance in terms of latency\
    \ and throughput.\n   4.  It benefits from native hardware support, for instance,\
    \ Intel's\n       New Instruction set GUE [GUE].\n"
- title: 5.  Test Vectors
  contents:
  - "5.  Test Vectors\n   For test vectors and their outputs, refer to Section 4 of\
    \ RFC 4493\n   [RFC4493].\n"

- title: 7.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "7.  Security Considerations\n   Refer to Appendices A, B, and C of the NIST document\
    \ [NIST] for a\n   recommendation for the CMAC mode of authentication; see the\
    \ Security\n   Considerations of RFC 4493 [RFC4493] for discussion on security\n\
    \   guarantees of AES-CMAC.\n"
