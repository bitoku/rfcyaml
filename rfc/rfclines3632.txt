Abstract This document updates version 1.1.0 of
the Network Solutions Inc. (NSI)
Registry Registrar Protocol (RRP) specified in RFC 2832.
The changes described in this document combined with the base specification documented in RFC 2832 specify version 2.0.0 of the VeriSign Registry Registrar Protocol. 1.
Registry Registrar Protocol (RRP) was developed by NSI in 1998 and 1999 to allow multiple registrars to provide second level Internet domain name registration services in the top level domains (TLDs) administered by the NSI TLD registry.
Version 1.1.0 of the NSI RRP was published as Informational RFC 2832 [2] in May 2000.
This document describes changes to RFC 2832 that specify version 2.0.0 of the protocol.
Conventions Used In This Document
The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, RFC 2119 [1].
In examples, "C:" represents lines sent by a protocol client and "S:"  represents lines returned by a protocol server.
This specification describes several modifications to RFC 2832 [2]: two new response codes have been added, domain TRANSFER command processing has been updated to allow a client to cancel a requested domain transfer, and support for IPv6 name server addresses has been added.
Response Codes Section 5.1 of RFC 2832 [2] has been updated to include two additional error response codes.
510 Invalid encoding The value of a domain name or
name server entity contains invalid ASCII compatible encoding used to represent an internationalized domain or host name.
The encoding is checked and verified in two situations: when registering an internationalized domain name or name server name, and when changing the name of a name server and the new name of the server is internationalized.
Section 5.2 of RFC 2832 [2] has been updated to include response code 510 as a possible error value returned from the ADD command:
Command: ADD Success: 200, 220 Failure: 420, 421, 500, 502, 503, 504, 505, 507, 508, 510, 520, 531, 535, 540, 541, 545, 546, 547, 549, 550,
554 557 Name server locked An attempt has been made to modify or delete a name server that is hosting a TLD in the root zone.
Modifications to the root zone can only be made with the approval of the U.S. Department of Commerce and IANA, so if the registrar absolutely needs to modify or delete such a name server, the action needs to be coordinated through the registry operator using an out of band communications channel.
Section 5.2 of RFC 2832 [2] has been updated to include response code 557 as a possible error value returned from the DEL and MOD commands:
200, 220 Failure: 420, 421, 500, 502, 503, 504, 505, 507, 508, 520, 531, 532, 533, 541, 544, 545, 547, 549, 551, 552, 553, 557 Command:
MOD Success: 200, 220 Failure: 420, 421, 500, 502, 503, 504, 505, 507, 508, 510, 520, 531, 535, 540, 541, 542, 543, 544, 545, 547, 549, 550, 551, 552, 553, 557 2.2.
TRANSFER Command Update Section 4.3.10 of RFC 2832 [2] has been updated to include an additional TRANSFER command processing option.
All registrars MAY use the TRANSFER command to request the transfer of registration service authority to the requesting registrar.
Only the current sponsoring registrar of a domain name may explicitly approve or reject a requested transfer.
The registry MAY implicitly approve or reject requested transfers after a fixed amount of time.
All registrars MAY use the TRANSFER command to request transfer of registration service authority to the requesting registrar.
Only the current sponsoring registrar of a domain name may explicitly approve a requested transfer.
The current sponsoring registrar MAY explicitly reject a requested transfer.
The registry MAY implicitly approve or reject requested transfers after a fixed amount of time.
The requesting registrar MAY cancel a pending request, but the request to cancel the transfer MUST be sent before it has been explicitly approved or rejected by the current sponsoring registrar or it has been implicitly approved or rejected by the registry.
Example: A registrar cancels a previously requested domain transfer:
S:200 Command completed successfully<crlf> S:.<crlf> 2.3.
IPv6 Name Server Addresses Section 7 of RFC 2832 [2] has been updated to include support for name servers using IPv6 addresses.
IPv6 addressing architecture is described in RFC 3513 [3].
grammar supplements the grammar defined in RFC 2832.
