  - "1.  Introduction\n   The SIP REFER method relies on the SIP-Specific Event Notification\n\
    \   framework.  That framework was revised by [RFC6665].  This document\n   highlights\
    \ the implications of the requirement changes in RFC 6665,\n   and updates [RFC3515]\
    \ to clarify and disambiguate the impact of those\n   changes.\n   Accepting a\
    \ REFER request (without invoking extensions) results in an\n   implicit SIP-Events\
    \ subscription.  If that REFER was part of an\n   existing dialog, the implicit\
    \ subscription creates a new, problematic\n   dialog usage within that dialog\
    \ [RFC5057].  The \"norefersub\"\n   extension defined in [RFC4488] asks to suppress\
    \ this implicit\n   subscription, but cannot prevent its creation.\n   There are\
    \ implementations in some known specialized environments\n   (such as 3GPP) that\
    \ use out-of-signaling agreements to ensure that\n   in-dialog REFER requests\
    \ using the RFC 4488 extension do not create a\n   new subscription inside that\
    \ dialog.  In the 3GPP environment, the\n   behavior is based on capabilities\
    \ advertised using media feature\n   tags.  That mechanism does not, however,\
    \ prevent additional dialog\n   usages when interoperating with implementations\
    \ that do not support\n   the mechanism.  The extensions in [RFC7614] provide\
    \ a standardized\n   mechanism that allows avoiding any additional dialog usage.\n"

    , \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\"\
    , \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n   document are to be interpreted as described\

- title: 3.  Use of GRUU Is Mandatory
  contents:
  - "3.  Use of GRUU Is Mandatory\n   Section 4.5.1 of [RFC6665] makes GRUU [RFC5627]\
    \ mandatory for\n   notifiers to implement and use as the local target in the\n\
    \   subscription created by the REFER request.\n   A user agent (UA) accepting\
    \ a REFER that creates a subscription MUST\n   populate its Contact header field\
    \ with a GRUU.\n   A UA that might possibly become a notifier (e.g., by accepting\
    \ a\n   REFER request that creates a subscription) needs to include a GRUU in\n\
    \   the Contact header field of dialog-forming and target-refresh methods\n  \
    \ (such as INVITE) [RFC7621].  This ensures that out-of-dialog REFER\n   requests\
    \ corresponding to any resulting INVITE dialogs arrive at this\n   UA.  Extensions\
    \ can relax this requirement by defining a REFER\n   request that cannot create\
    \ an implicit subscription, thus not causing\n   the accepting UA to become an\
    \ RFC 6665 notifier in the context of\n   this dialog.  [RFC7614] is an example\
    \ of such an extension.\n"
- title: 4.  Dialog Reuse Is Prohibited
  contents:
  - "4.  Dialog Reuse Is Prohibited\n   If a peer in an existing dialog has provided\
    \ a GRUU as its Contact,\n   sending a REFER that might result in an additional\
    \ dialog usage\n   within that dialog is prohibited.  This is a direct consequence\
    \ of\n   [RFC6665] requiring the use of GRUU and the requirements in\n   Section\
    \ 4.5.2 of that document.\n   A user agent constructing a REFER request that could\
    \ result in an\n   implicit subscription in a dialog MUST build it as an out-of-dialog\n\
    \   message as defined in [RFC3261], unless the remote endpoint is an\n   older\
    \ implementation of RFC 3515 that has not been updated to conform\n   to RFC 6665\
    \ (as determined by the absence of a GRUU in the remote\n   target).  Thus, the\
    \ REFER request will have no tag parameter in its\n   To: header field.\n   Using\
    \ the \"norefersub\" option tag [RFC4488] does not change this\n   requirement,\
    \ even if used in a \"Require\" header field.  Even if the\n   recipient supports\
    \ the \"norefersub\" mechanism, and accepts the\n   request with the option tag\
    \ in the \"Require\" header field, it is\n   allowed to return a \"Refer-Sub\"\
    \ header field with a value of \"true\"\n   in the response, and create an implicit\
    \ subscription.\n   A user agent wishing to identify an existing dialog (such\
    \ as for call\n   transfer as defined in [RFC5589]) MUST use the \"Target-Dialog\"\
    \n   extension defined in [RFC4538] to do so, and user agents accepting\n   REFER\
    \ MUST be able to process that extension in requests they\n   receive.\n   If\
    \ a user agent can be certain that no implicit subscription will be\n   created\
    \ as a result of sending a REFER request (such as by requiring\n   an extension\
    \ that disallows any such subscription [RFC7614]), the\n   REFER request MAY be\
    \ sent within an existing dialog (whether or not\n   the remote target is a GRUU).\
    \  Such a REFER will be constructed with\n   its Contact header field populated\
    \ with the dialog's local URI as\n   specified in Section 12 of [RFC3261].\n \
    \  As described in Section 4.5.2 of [RFC6665], there are cases where a\n   user\
    \ agent may fall back to sharing existing dialogs for backwards-\n   compatibility\
    \ purposes.  This applies to a REFER only when the peer\n   has not provided a\
    \ GRUU as its Contact in the existing dialog (i.e.,\n   when the peer is an implementation\
    \ of RFC 3515 that has not been\n   updated to conform with RFC 6665).\n"
- title: 5.  The 202 Response Code Is Deprecated
  contents:
  - "5.  The 202 Response Code Is Deprecated\n   Section 8.3.1 of [RFC6665] requires\
    \ that elements not send a 202\n   response code to a subscribe request, but use\
    \ the 200 response code\n   instead.  Any 202 response codes received to a subscribe\
    \ request are\n   treated as 200s.  These changes also apply to REFER.  Specifically,\n\
    \   an element accepting a REFER request MUST NOT reply with a 202\n   response\
    \ code and MUST treat any 202 responses received as identical\n   to a 200 response.\
    \  Wherever [RFC3515] requires sending a 202\n   response code, a 200 response\
    \ code MUST be sent instead.\n"
- title: 6.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "6.  Security Considerations\n   This document introduces no new security considerations\
    \ directly.\n   The updated considerations in [RFC6665] apply to the implicit\n\
    \   subscription created by an accepted REFER request.\n"
