  title: Copyright Notice
- contents:
  - "1. Abstract\n   A new URL scheme, \"data\", is defined. It allows inclusion of
    small\n   data items as \"immediate\" data, as if it had been included\n   externally.\n"
  title: 1. Abstract
- contents:
  - "2. Description\n   Some applications that use URLs also have a need to embed
    (small)\n   media type data directly inline. This document defines a new URL\n
    \  scheme that would work like 'immediate addressing'. The URLs are of\n   the
    form:\n                    data:[<mediatype>][;base64],<data>\n   The <mediatype>
    is an Internet media type specification (with\n   optional parameters.) The appearance
    of \";base64\" means that the data\n   is encoded as base64. Without \";base64\",
    the data (as a sequence of\n   octets) is represented using ASCII encoding for
    octets inside the\n   range of safe URL characters and using the standard %xx
    hex encoding\n   of URLs for octets outside that range.  If <mediatype> is omitted,
    it\n   defaults to text/plain;charset=US-ASCII.  As a shorthand,\n   \"text/plain\"
    can be omitted but the charset parameter supplied.\n   The \"data:\" URL scheme
    is only useful for short values. Note that\n   some applications that use URLs
    may impose a length limit; for\n   example, URLs embedded within <A> anchors in
    HTML have a length limit\n   determined by the SGML declaration for HTML [RFC1866].
    The LITLEN\n   (1024) limits the number of characters which can appear in a single\n
    \  attribute value literal, the ATTSPLEN (2100) limits the sum of all\n   lengths
    of all attribute value specifications which appear in a tag,\n   and the TAGLEN
    (2100) limits the overall length of a tag.\n   The \"data\" URL scheme has no
    relative URL forms.\n"

  - "3. Syntax\n       dataurl    := \"data:\" [ mediatype ] [ \";base64\" ] \",\"
    data\n       mediatype  := [ type \"/\" subtype ] *( \";\" parameter )\n       data
    \      := *urlchar\n       parameter  := attribute \"=\" value\n   where \"urlchar\"
    is imported from [RFC2396], and \"type\", \"subtype\",\n   \"attribute\" and \"value\"
    are the corresponding tokens from [RFC2045],\n   represented using URL escaped
    encoding of [RFC2396] as necessary.\n   Attribute values in [RFC2045] are allowed
    to be either represented as\n   tokens or as quoted strings. However, within a
    \"data\" URL, the\n   \"quoted-string\" representation would be awkward, since
    the quote mark\n   is itself not a valid urlchar. For this reason, parameter values\n
    \  should use the URL Escaped encoding instead of quoted string if the\n   parameter
    values contain any \"tspecial\".\n   The \";base64\" extension is distinguishable
    from a content-type\n   parameter by the fact that it doesn't have a following
    \"=\" sign.\n"

  - "4. Examples\n   A data URL might be used for arbitrary types of data. The URL\n
    \                         data:,A%20brief%20note\n   encodes the text/plain string
    \"A brief note\", which might be useful\n   in a footnote link.\n   The HTML fragment:\n
    \  <IMG\n   SRC=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODdhMAAwAPAAAAAAAP///ywAAAAAMAAw\n
    \  AAAC8IyPqcvt3wCcDkiLc7C0qwyGHhSWpjQu5yqmCYsapyuvUUlvONmOZtfzgFz\n   ByTB10QgxOR0TqBQejhRNzOfkVJ+5YiUqrXF5Y5lKh/DeuNcP5yLWGsEbtLiOSp\n

    \  ALT=\"Larry\">\n   could be used for a small inline image in a HTML document.
    \ (The\n   embedded image is probably near the limit of utility. For anything\n
    \  else larger, data URLs are likely to be inappropriate.)\n   A data URL scheme's
    media type specification can include other\n   parameters; for example, one might
    specify a charset parameter.\n      data:text/plain;charset=iso-8859-7,%be%fg%be\n
    \  can be used for a short sequence of greek characters.\n   Some applications
    may use the \"data\" URL scheme in order to provide\n   setup parameters for other
    kinds of networking applications. For\n   example, one might create a media type\n
    \          application/vnd-xxx-query\n   whose content consists of a query string
    and a database identifier\n   for the \"xxx\" vendor's databases. A URL of the
    form:\n   data:application/vnd-xxx-\n   query,select_vcount,fcol_from_fieldtable/local\n
    \  could then be used in a local application to launch the \"helper\" for\n   application/vnd-xxx-query
    and give it the immediate data included.\n"

  - "5. History\n   This idea was originally proposed August 1995. Some versions of
    the\n   data URL scheme have been used in the definition of VRML, and a\n   version
    has appeared as part of a proposal for embedded data in HTML.\n   Various changes
    have been made, based on requests, to elide the media\n   type, pack the indication
    of the base64 encoding more tightly, and\n   eliminate \"quoted printable\" as
    an encoding since it would not easily\n   yield valid URLs without additional
    %xx encoding, which itself is\n   sufficient. The \"data\" URL scheme is in use
    in VRML, new applications\n   of HTML, and various commercial products. It is
    being used for object\n   parameters in Java and ActiveX applications.\n"
  title: 5. History
- contents:
  - "6. Security\n   Interpretation of the data within a \"data\" URL has the same
    security\n   considerations as any implementation of the given media type.  An\n
    \  application should not interpret the contents of a data URL which is\n   marked
    with a media type that has been disallowed for processing by\n   the application's
    configuration.\n   Sites which use firewall proxies to disallow the retrieval
    of certain\n   media types (such as application script languages or types with
    known\n   security problems) will find it difficult to screen against the\n   inclusion
    of such types using the \"data\" URL scheme.  However, they\n   should be aware
    of the threat and take whatever precautions are\n   considered necessary within
    their domain.\n   The effect of using long \"data\" URLs in applications is currently\n
    \  unknown; some software packages may exhibit unreasonable behavior\n   when
    confronted with data that exceeds its allocated buffer size.\n"
