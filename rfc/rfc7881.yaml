  title: 1.  Introduction
- contents:
  - "2.  S-BFD UDP Port\n   A new UDP port is defined for use by S-BFD in IPv4, IPv6,
    and MPLS\n   environments: 7784.\n   In S-BFD Control packets from the SBFDInitiator
    to the SBFDReflector,\n   the SBFDReflector session MUST listen for incoming S-BFD
    Control\n   packets on port 7784.  SBFDInitiator sessions MUST transmit S-BFD\n
    \  Control packets with destination port 7784.  The source port of the\n   S-BFD
    Control packets transmitted by SBFDInitiator sessions can be\n   any port, with
    one exception: it MUST NOT be 7784.  The same UDP\n   source port number MUST
    be used for all S-BFD Control packets\n   associated with a particular SBFDInitiator
    session.  The source port\n   number is unique among all SBFDInitiator sessions
    on the system.\n   In S-BFD Control packets from the SBFDReflector to the SBFDInitiator,\n
    \  the SBFDInitiator session MUST listen for reflected S-BFD Control\n   packets
    at its source port.\n"
  title: 2.  S-BFD UDP Port
- contents:
  - "3.  S-BFD Echo UDP Port\n   The BFD Echo port defined by [RFC5881], port 3785,
    is used for the\n   S-BFD Echo function in IPv4, IPv6, and MPLS environments.\n
    \  SBFDInitiator sessions MUST transmit S-BFD Echo packets with\n   destination
    port 3785.  The setting of the UDP source port [RFC5881]\n   and the procedures
    [RFC7880] for the S-BFD Echo function are outside\n   the scope of this document.\n"

- contents:
  - "4.  S-BFD Control Packet Demultiplexing\n   S-BFD Control packet demultiplexing
    follows the procedure specified\n   in Section 7.1 of [RFC7880].  A received S-BFD
    Control packet MUST be\n   demultiplexed with the destination UDP port field.\n
    \  This procedure for an S-BFD packet is executed on both the initiator\n   and
    the reflector.  If the port is 7784 (i.e., an S-BFD packet for\n   the SBFDReflector),
    then the packet MUST be looked up to locate a\n   corresponding SBFDReflector
    session based on the value from the\n   Your Discriminator field in the table
    describing S-BFD\n   Discriminators.  If the port is not 7784 but the packet is\n
    \  demultiplexed to be for an SBFDInitiator, then the packet MUST be\n   looked
    up to locate a corresponding SBFDInitiator session based on\n   the value from
    the Your Discriminator field in the table describing\n   BFD Discriminators.  In
    that case, the destination IP address of the\n   packet SHOULD be validated to
    be for itself.  If the packet\n   demultiplexes to a classical BFD session, then
    the procedures from\n   [RFC5880] apply.\n"

  - "5.  Initiator Procedures\n   S-BFD Control packets are transmitted with an IP
    header, UDP header,\n   and BFD Control packet ([RFC5880]).  When S-BFD Control
    packets are\n   explicitly label switched (i.e., not IP routed and forwarded over
    a\n   Label Switched Path (LSP), but explicitly sent on a specific LSP),\n   the
    former is prepended with a label stack.  Note that this document\n   does not
    make a distinction between a single-hop S-BFD scenario and a\n   multi-hop S-BFD
    scenario; both scenarios are supported.\n   The necessary values in the BFD control
    headers are described in\n   [RFC7880].  Section 5.1 describes necessary values
    in the MPLS\n   header, IP header, and UDP header when an SBFDInitiator on the\n
    \  initiator is sending S-BFD Control packets.\n"

      is\n         multiple hops away).\n      *  The UDP destination port MUST be
      set to a well-known UDP\n         destination port assigned for S-BFD, i.e.,

      255.\n      *  The destination IP address MUST be chosen from the 127/8 range\n

      - "5.1.1.  Target versus Remote Entity (S-BFD Discriminator)\n   Typically,
        an S-BFD Control packet will have the Your Discriminator\n   field corresponding
        to an S-BFD Discriminator of the remote entity\n   located on the target network
        node defined by the destination IP\n   address or the label stack.  It is,
        however, possible for an\n   SBFDInitiator to carefully set the Your Discriminator
        and TTL fields\n   to perform a continuity test in the direction towards a
        target, but\n   destined to a transit network node and not to the target itself.\n
        \  Section 5.1 intentionally uses the word \"target\" instead of \"remote\n
        \  entity\" to accommodate this possible S-BFD usage through TTL expiry.\n
        \  This also requires that S-BFD Control packets not be dropped by the\n   responder
        node due to TTL expiry.  Thus, implementations on the\n   responder MUST allow
        received S-BFD Control packets taking a TTL\n   expiry exception path to reach
        the corresponding SBFDReflector\n   session.  This is an existing packet-processing
        exception practice\n   for Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM)
        packets, where\n   the control plane further identifies the type of OAM by
        the protocol\n   and port numbers.\n"

    \ If an\n   SBFDReflector receives an S-BFD Control packet with a UDP source port\n
    \  of 7784, the packet MUST be discarded.  Necessary values in the BFD\n   control
    header are described in [RFC7880].  Section 6.1 describes\n   necessary values

    \  security aspects of the mechanism described by this document:\n   o  Implementations
    MUST provide filtering capability based on source\n      IP addresses of received
    S-BFD Control packets; see [RFC2827].\n   o  Implementations MUST NOT act on received
    S-BFD Control packets\n      containing source Martian IP addresses (i.e., addresses
    that, by\n      application of the current forwarding tables, would not have their\n
    \     return traffic routed back to the sender).\n   o  Implementations MUST ensure
