- title: 1. Introduction
  contents:
  - "1. Introduction\n   The global Internet Domain Name System is documented in [RFC\
    \ 1034,\n   1035, 1591] and numerous additional Requests for Comment.  It defines\n\
    \   a tree of names starting with root, \".\", immediately below which are\n \
    \  top level domain names such as \".com\" and \".us\". Below top level\n   domain\
    \ names there are normally additional levels of names.\n"
- title: 2. TLDs for Testing, & Documentation Examples
  contents:
  - "2. TLDs for Testing, & Documentation Examples\n   There is a need for top level\
    \ domain (TLD) names that can be used for\n   creating names which, without fear\
    \ of conflicts with current or\n   future actual TLD names in the global DNS,\
    \ can be used for private\n   testing of existing DNS related code, examples in\
    \ documentation, DNS\n   related experimentation, invalid DNS names, or other\
    \ similar uses.\n   For example, without guidance, a site might set up some local\n\
    \   additional unused top level domains for testing of its local DNS code\n  \
    \ and configuration. Later, these TLDs might come into actual use on\n   the global\
    \ Internet.  As a result, local attempts to reference the\n   real data in these\
    \ zones could be thwarted by the local test\n   versions.  Or test or example\
    \ code might be written that accesses a\n   TLD that is in use with the thought\
    \ that the test code would only be\n   run in a restricted testbed net or the\
    \ example never actually run.\n   Later, the test code could escape from the testbed\
    \ or the example be\n   actually coded and run on the Internet. Depending on the\
    \ nature of\n   the test or example, it might be best for it to be referencing\
    \ a TLD\n   permanently reserved for such purposes.\n   To safely satisfy these\
    \ needs, four domain names are reserved as\n   listed and described below.\n \
    \                  .test\n                .example\n                .invalid\n\
    \              .localhost\n      \".test\" is recommended for use in testing of\
    \ current or new DNS\n      related code.\n      \".example\" is recommended for\
    \ use in documentation or as examples.\n      \".invalid\" is intended for use\
    \ in online construction of domain\n      names that are sure to be invalid and\
    \ which it is obvious at a\n      glance are invalid.\n      The \".localhost\"\
    \ TLD has traditionally been statically defined in\n      host DNS implementations\
    \ as having an A record pointing to the\n      loop back IP address and is reserved\
    \ for such use.  Any other use\n      would conflict with widely deployed code\
    \ which assumes this use.\n"
- title: 3. Reserved Example Second Level Domain Names
  contents:
  - "3. Reserved Example Second Level Domain Names\n   The Internet Assigned Numbers\
    \ Authority (IANA) also currently has the\n   following second level domain names\
    \ reserved which can be used as\n   examples.\n        example.com\n        example.net\n\
    \        example.org\n"
- title: 4. IANA Considerations
  contents:
  - "4. IANA Considerations\n   IANA has agreed to the four top level domain name\
    \ reservations\n   specified in this document and will reserve them for the uses\n\
    \   indicated.\n"
- title: 5. Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "5. Security Considerations\n   Confusion and conflict can be caused by the use\
    \ of a current or\n   future top level domain name in experimentation or testing,\
    \ as an\n   example in documentation, to indicate invalid names, or as a synonym\n\
    \   for the loop back address.  Test and experimental software can escape\n  \
    \ and end up being run against the global operational DNS.  Even\n   examples\
    \ used \"only\" in documentation can end up being coded and\n   released or cause\
    \ conflicts due to later real use and the possible\n   acquisition of intellectual\
    \ property rights in such \"example\" names.\n   The reservation of several top\
    \ level domain names for these purposes\n   will minimize such confusion and conflict.\n"
