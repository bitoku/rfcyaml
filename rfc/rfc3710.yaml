  contents:
  - "1.1.  The Role of the IESG\n   The Internet Engineering Steering Group (IESG)\
    \ is the group\n   responsible for the direct operation of the IETF and for ensuring\
    \ the\n   quality of work produced by the IETF.\n   The IESG charters and terminates\
    \ working groups, selects their\n   chairs, monitors their progress and coordinates\
    \ efforts between them.\n   The IESG performs technical review and approval of\
    \ working group\n   documents and candidates for the IETF standards track, and\
    \ reviews\n   other candidates for publication in the RFC series.  It also\n \
    \  administers IETF logistics, including operation of the Internet-Draft\n   document\
    \ series and the IETF meeting event.\n"
- title: 1.2.  Historic Note
  contents:
  - "1.2.  Historic Note\n   The role of the IESG in the IETF management structure\
    \ has been\n   largely constant since 1993, after the significant changes introduced\n\
    \   by the \"POISED\" process, and documented in RFC 1602 [5].  (The\n   previous\
    \ process was documented in RFC 1310 [4]; RFC 1602 has later\n   been updated\
    \ by RFC 1871 [7] and obsoleted by RFC 2026 [1].)\n   Some of the functions were\
    \ also defined in RFC 1603 [6], Working\n   Group Guidelines, which was later\
    \ obsoleted by RFC 2418 [2].\n   As the community has grown, and the IESG has\
    \ gathered experience, the\n   ways in which the IESG has approached its tasks\
    \ have varied\n   considerably, but the tasks have remained relatively constant.\n\
    \   This document describes the tasks assigned to the IESG.  It does not\n   attempt\
    \ to describe in detail the procedures the IESG uses to\n   accomplish these tasks;\
    \ that is done elsewhere - consult the IESG's\n   Web pages on the IETF Website\
    \ for more information [9].\n   At this time (spring 2003), the structure of the\
    \ IETF is undergoing\n   reevaluation, and the result is likely to include changes\
    \ to the\n   IESG's role.  Therefore, this document was written as a\n   \"documentation\
    \ of existing practice\" rather than as IETF consensus on\n   what the IESG should\
    \ do.\n   This document is published as an Informational RFC, detailing the\n\
    \   current operations of the IESG.  It does not claim to represent\n   consensus\
    \ of the IETF that this is the right set of instructions to\n   the IESG.\n"
- title: 2.  The Composition of the IESG
  contents:
  - "2.  The Composition of the IESG\n   The IESG has the following members:\n   o\
    \  The IETF Chair, who also functions as the General Area Director\n      when\
    \ this area is active\n   o  The Area Directors (ADs) for the IETF Areas\n   o\
    \  The Internet Architecture Board (IAB) Chair and the IETF Executive\n      Director,\
    \ as ex-officio members of the IESG.\n   The IETF Chair and the Area Directors\
    \ are selected by the IETF NomCom\n   according to the procedures of BCP 10 [3]\
    \ (Nomcom procedures).\n   The IETF Executive Director is the person charged with\
    \ running the\n   IETF Secretariat.\n   The IESG also has liaisons, who are members\
    \ of the IESG mailing list\n   and may attend all IESG meetings.  The Liaison\
    \ positions exist to\n   facilitate the work of the IETF by expediting communication\
    \ with\n   other entities involved in the IETF process; which positions to have\n\
    \   are decided by the IESG.\n   The liaisons are selected as appropriate by the\
    \ bodies they\n   represent.  At the time of this writing, the liaisons present\n\
    \   represent the following bodies:\n      The RFC Editor\n      The IANA\n  \
    \    The IAB\n   In addition, members of the IETF Secretariat are subscribed to\
    \ the\n   mailing list and present in the IESG meetings as needed in order to\n\
    \   serve as a support function.\n   IESG decisions are made by the IETF Chair\
    \ and the Area Directors.\n   All IESG members can participate in the IESG's discussions.\n"
- title: 3.  Procedural Issues
  contents:
  - "3.  Procedural Issues\n   While the IESG is generally free to set its own procedures,\
    \ some\n   parts of its procedures are properly part of its charter.  These are\n\
    \   given here.\n"
- title: 3.1.  Decision Making
  contents:
  - "3.1.  Decision Making\n   The IESG attempts to reach all decisions unanimously.\
    \  If unanimity\n   cannot be achieved, the chair may conduct informal polls to\
    \ determine\n   consensus.  There is no general rule on how the IESG takes votes;\
    \ if\n   this had ever been needed, it is likely that the same rule as for the\n\
    \   IAB would be used (decisions may be taken if at least two thirds of\n   the\
    \ members concur and there are no more than two dissents).\n   For the purpose\
    \ of judging consensus, only the IETF Chair and the\n   Area Directors are counted.\n\
    \   The IESG may decide that other procedures for reaching a decision are\n  \
    \ appropriate under specific conditions.  Such other procedures may\n   include:\n\
    \   o  Assertions of IETF consensus, such as when evaluating a standards\n   \
    \   action.  Here, in addition to the technical quality of the\n      specification,\
    \ the IESG has to evaluate the community opinion\n      about the specification's\
    \ subject matter; this has to happen with\n      due notice and opportunity for\
    \ community feedback.\n   o  IESG actions in areas where the IESG has the authority\
    \ to take\n      action.  This does not need special rules.\n   o  AD actions\
    \ taken with the advice and consent of the IESG; the IESG\n      is expected to\
    \ be kept informed, and gives comment, but the\n      authority to act is delegated\
    \ to the AD.\n   o  AD action; cases where an AD can take independent action without\n\
    \      needing to consult the IESG first.\n   The IESG may reach decisions by\
    \ face to face meeting,\n   teleconferencing, Internet communication, or any combination\
    \ of the\n   above.\n"
- title: 3.2.  Openness and Confidentiality
  contents:
  - "3.2.  Openness and Confidentiality\n   The IESG publishes a record of decisions\
    \ from its meetings on the\n   Internet, and conducts an open meeting at every\
    \ IETF meeting.  It\n   publishes more detailed documentation of decisions as\
    \ RFCs, Internet\n   Drafts or messages to the IETF-announce mailing list, with\
    \ copies\n   kept on the IETF website when appropriate.\n   The IESG also has\
    \ private group discussions, using any means of its\n   choice, including email.\
    \  Records of those discussions are not\n   required to be made public.  This\
    \ is believed to be vital in\n   permitting a frank exchange of viewpoints and\
    \ worries, allowing\n   people to speak out freely on topics known to be controversial,\
    \ and\n   permitting people to change their minds based on presented arguments.\n\
    \   Decisions and their justification are a matter of public record.\n   However,\
    \ discussion of personnel matters and possibly legal and\n   financial matters\
    \ may sometimes be required to be kept confidential,\n   and the chair may, with\
    \ the consent of the full members, exclude\n   liaison and ex officio members\
    \ whose presence is seen as\n   inappropriate for the particular discussion.\n\
    \   The chair may also exclude members and liaisons who have a serious\n   conflict\
    \ of interest on an issue (although this has never been\n   enacted).  Members\
    \ can also choose to recuse themselves from\n   discussion of an issue, or refrain\
    \ from participating in a particular\n   ballot, if they feel it is appropriate.\n"
- title: 4.  The IESG Role in Working Group Management
  contents:
  - "4.  The IESG Role in Working Group Management\n   The IESG is in charge of managing\
    \ the working group process.  While\n   the process of managing a working group\
    \ is assigned to the working\n   group chairs, the IESG is in charge of those\
    \ processes that are\n   beyond the scope of the working group chair's role. \
    \ Most of these\n   functions are delegated by the IESG to a single Area Director\
    \ - the\n   \"responsible Area Director\" for the group.\n"
- title: 4.1.  Working Group Creation
  contents:
  - "4.1.  Working Group Creation\n   The formation of working groups is described\
    \ in  BCP 25 [2], section\n   2; this document does not repeat the text there,\
    \ but gives additional\n   details of IESG actions.\n   A Working Group (WG) may\
    \ be requested by members of the IETF\n   community, who address the request to\
    \ an AD that the requesters feel\n   is the appropriate AD for the task, or the\
    \ formation can be initiated\n   by an AD.  The IESG may assign the prospective\
    \ working group to\n   another AD and/or Area if the IESG thinks that is best.\n\
    \   The AD is responsible for ensuring that a working group being\n   chartered\
    \ fulfills the criteria for WG formation given in BCP 25.\n   The charter is the\
    \ result of a negotiation between the AD and the\n   community of interest, with\
    \ review and advice from the rest of the\n   IESG and the IAB.\n   The AD, with\
    \ the advice of the IESG, is also responsible for\n   selecting chairs for the\
    \ working group which the AD thinks will be up\n   to the task.\n   All charters\
    \ for proposed working groups are announced to the\n   community at large when\
    \ the IESG thinks the charter is ready for\n   review, but prior to the IESGs\
    \ final decision on chartering the WG.\n   The final decision to charter a WG\
    \ is an IESG decision.\n   The Birds of a Feather (BOF) procedure described in\
    \ BCP 25 [2],\n   section 2.4 also requires approval from the relevant AD (the\
    \ one who\n   got the request or the AD that the IESG thinks is the right AD to\n\
    \   manage the task).  A BOF is not required to start a working group,\n   and\
    \ a BOF may be held without the purpose of creating a working\n   group.  BOFs\
    \ are also often discussed with the IESG and IAB.\n"
- title: 4.2.  Working Group Management
  contents:
  - "4.2.  Working Group Management\n   The role of the Area Director in WG management\
    \ is described in BCP 25\n   [2], section 6.7.\n   The role of managing a WG is\
    \ divided between the WG Chair(s) and the\n   AD.\n   A WG chair has to manage\
    \ the working group \"from the inside\", dealing\n   with individuals, drafts,\
    \ proposals, meetings and email lists, and\n   has full power and responsibility\
    \ to do that.\n   An AD manages a WG \"from the outside\", dealing with charters,\
    \ chairs,\n   cross-WG and cross-area relationships and so on.\n   The AD is responsible\
    \ for making sure the working groups stay focused\n   on the charter tasks, make\
    \ forward progress, are coordinated with the\n   rest of the area, and are coordinated\
    \ with the rest of the IETF.  The\n   ADs help each other with maintaining cross-area\
    \ coordination.\n   In a well functioning working group, main responsibility for\
    \ these\n   things rests with the chairs; the AD will normally be able to\n  \
    \ concentrate on supporting the working group chairs' work.\n   When a WG finds\
    \ that it is essential that work gets done which is not\n   on its charter, the\
    \ AD, consulting with the rest of the IESG as\n   required, is responsible for\
    \ figuring out whether to add it to their\n   charter, add it to another group's\
    \ charter, task someone outside the\n   WG to work on it, or initiate creation\
    \ of another WG.\n   Substantive changes to the body of a WG's charter require\
    \ the same\n   type of process as chartering - see BCP 25 [2], section 5.\n  \
    \ The Area Director is also responsible for picking and, when\n   necessary, replacing\
    \ working group chairs.  This is done in\n   consultation with the IESG, but the\
    \ decision is made by the\n   responsible AD.\n"
- title: 4.3.  Working Group Termination
  contents:
  - "4.3.  Working Group Termination\n   Terminating a WG is a decision of the responsible\
    \ AD.\n   A working group may be shut down when its work is complete, or when\n\
    \   the AD concludes that letting the working group continue its work no\n   longer\
    \ contributes to the IETF's progress.\n   The decision to terminate a working\
    \ group is announced, giving the\n   reason for termination.\n"
- title: 5.  The IESG Role in Document Review
  contents:
  - "5.  The IESG Role in Document Review\n   The IESG is expected to ensure that\
    \ the documents are of a sufficient\n   quality for release as RFCs, that they\
    \ describe their subject matter\n   well, and that there are no outstanding engineering\
    \ issues that\n   should be addressed before publication.  The degree of review\
    \ will\n   vary with the intended status and perceived importance of the\n   documents.\n\
    \   When there are problems or solutions that occur frequently, the IESG\n   may\
    \ publish documents describing the problems and how to avoid them,\n   such as\
    \ \"IANA considerations\" (BCP 26 [8]), or publish web pages with\n   commonly\
    \ used guidelines.\n   Rules - stuff that the community is expected to follow\
    \ - are decided\n   by IETF consensus processing and commonly published as BCP\
    \ RFCs.\n   Guidance to the community that is of a more ephemeral and less\n \
    \  normative nature is decided by the IESG and published on the IESG's\n   Web\
    \ pages.\n"

  - "5.2.1.  Standards-Track Documents\n   This role, which applies to Proposed, Draft,\
    \ Standard and BCP\n   processing, is described in BCP 9 [1], section 6.  Such\
    \ documents are\n   submitted to the IESG, and are then assigned to a relevant\
    \ AD.  The\n   IESG is responsible for determining:\n   o  Whether or not the\
    \ specification is appropriate for the standards\n      track\n   o  Whether or\
    \ not the specification needs review by one or more\n      existing WGs\n   o\
    \  Whether or not the quality of the specification is adequate\n   The IESG will\
    \ either approve or disapprove of the publication of the\n   document on the standards\
    \ track; no document can be published on the\n   standards track without IESG\
    \ approval.\n   The IESG may decide that a document submitted for standards-track\n\
    \   publication should instead be published as Experimental or\n   Informational,\
    \ or that a document submitted for Proposed standard\n   should be published as\
    \ a BCP, or vice versa.\n"
- title: 5.2.2.  Informational and Experimental Documents
  contents:
  - "5.2.2.  Informational and Experimental Documents\n   These documents are normally\
    \ submitted to the RFC Editor in\n   accordance with the procedures of BCP 9 [1],\
    \ section 4.2.3 and BCP 25\n   [2], section 8.  The IESG is asked to review all\
    \ documents submitted\n   in this fashion for conflicts with the IETF standards\
    \ process or work\n   done in the IETF community; this is a modification of the\
    \ BCP 9 [1]\n   procedure, and documented in BCP 25 [2], section 8.\n   The IESG\
    \ may recommend that the document be published as-is, that it\n   be reviewed\
    \ by a working group, that the document be published with\n   an IESG note indicating\
    \ issues such as conflict with the IETF\n   standards process, or may recommend\
    \ that the document not be\n   published.\n   If the document is referred to a\
    \ WG, the WG can recommend that the\n   document be adopted as a WG document,\
    \ that it be published (possibly\n   with comments), or that the IESG recommend\
    \ to the RFC Editor that it\n   not be published.  The responsible AD for the\
    \ WG is responsible for\n   getting a response from the WG in a timely manner.\n\
    \   An AD, in consultation with the author, may choose to put an\n   individual's\
    \ document directly before the IESG, without waiting for\n   the document to be\

    \ specific AD the responsibility\n   of shepherding the document; that AD will\
    \ normally review the\n   document, and possibly ask for revisions to it to address\
    \ obvious\n   problems, before asking the entire IESG to consider it for\n   publication.\n\
    \   The IESG has web pages as part of the IETF web (www.ietf.org);\n   current\
    \ details of procedures, as well as the means of finding the\n   responsible AD\
    \ for any document, are published there.\n"
- title: 6.  The IESG Role in Area Management
  contents:
  - "6.  The IESG Role in Area Management\n   The IETF divides its work into a number\
    \ of areas, each comprised of\n   working groups that relate to that area's focus\
    \ (BCP 25 [2], section\n   1).  The area structure is defined by the IESG, and\
    \ the IESG can add\n   areas, redefine areas, merge areas, change the number of\
    \ ADs assigned\n   to an area, or close down areas.\n   Changes to the area structure\
    \ affect the IETF in many ways; decisions\n   to change the area structure are\
    \ taken in consultation with the\n   community.\n   When changing the area structure,\
    \ the IESG can decide which members\n   are responsible for new and changed areas,\
    \ including making one\n   sitting AD responsible for multiple areas, but the\
    \ IESG can only add\n   new members through the nomcom process.\n   The primary\
    \ task of area management is handled by one or two Area\n   Directors per area.\
    \  An AD may be advised by one or more\n   directorates, which are created, selected,\
    \ chaired and if necessary\n   disbanded by the AD (BCP 25 [2], section 1).  Directorates\
    \ may be\n   specific to an area, specific to a technology, or chartered in some\n\
    \   other fashion.\n   The ADs for an area are jointly responsible for making\
    \ sure the WGs\n   in the area are well coordinated, that there is coverage for\
    \ the\n   technologies needed in the area, and that the challenges most\n   important\
    \ to the Internet in that area are indeed being worked on.\n   The IESG decides\
    \ which areas working groups belong to.\n"
