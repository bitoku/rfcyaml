  - "1.  Introduction\n   This document is a revision of and supercedes RFC 2727 [2].\
    \  It is a\n   complete specification of the process by which members of the IAB\
    \ and\n   IESG are selected, confirmed, and recalled as of the date of its\n \
    \  approval.\n   The following two assumptions continue to be true of this\n \
    \  specification.\n   1. The Internet Research Task Force (IRTF) and Internet\
    \ Research\n      Steering Group (IRSG) are not a part of the process described\n\
    \      here.\n   2. The organization (and re-organization) of the IESG is not\
    \ a part\n      of the process described here.\n   The time frames specified here\
    \ use IETF meetings as a frame of\n   reference.  The time frames assume that\
    \ the IETF meets three times\n   per calendar year with approximately equal amounts\
    \ of time between\n   them.  The meetings are referred to as the First IETF, Second\
    \ IETF,\n   or Third IETF as needed.\n   The next section lists the words and\
    \ phrases commonly used throughout\n   this document with their intended meaning.\n\
    \   The majority of this document is divided into four major topics as\n   follows.\n\
    \   General: This a set of rules and constraints that apply to the\n      selection\
    \ and confirmation process as a whole.\n   Nominating Committee Selection: This\
    \ is the process by which the\n      volunteers who will serve on the committee\
    \ are recognized.\n   Nominating Committee Operation: This is the set of principles,\
    \ rules,\n      and constraints that guide the activities of the nominating\n\
    \      committee, including the confirmation process.\n   Member Recall: This\
    \ is the process by which the behavior of a sitting\n      member of the IESG\
    \ or IAB may be questioned, perhaps resulting in\n      the removal of the sitting\
    \ member.\n   A final section describes how this document differs from its\n \
    \  predecessor: RFC 2727 [2].\n   An appendix of useful facts and practices collected\
    \ from previous\n   nominating committees is also included.\n"

- title: 3.  General
  contents:
  - "3.  General\n   The following set of rules apply to the process as a whole. \
    \ If\n   necessary, a paragraph discussing the interpretation of each rule is\n\
    \   included.\n   1. The completion of the annual process is due within 7 months.\n\
    \      The completion of the annual process is due one month prior to the\n  \
    \    Friday of the week before the First IETF.  It is expected to begin\n    \
    \  at least 8 months prior to the Friday of the week before the First\n      IETF.\n\
    \      The process officially begins with the announcement of the Chair\n    \
    \  of the committee.  The process officially ends when all confirmed\n      candidates\
    \ have been announced.\n      The annual process is comprised of three major components\
    \ as\n      follows.\n      1. The selection and organization of the nominating\
    \ committee\n         members.\n      2. The selection of candidates by the nominating\
    \ committee.\n      3. The confirmation of the candidates.\n      There is an\
    \ additional month set aside between when the annual\n      process is expected\
    \ to end and the term of the new candidates is\n      to begin.  This time may\
    \ be used during unusual circumstances to\n      extend the time allocated for\
    \ any of the components listed above.\n   2. The principal functions of the nominating\
    \ committee are to review\n      each open IESG and IAB position and to either\
    \ nominate its\n      incumbent or a superior candidate.\n      Although there\
    \ is no term limit for serving in any IESG or IAB\n      position, the nominating\
    \ committee may use length of service as\n      one of its criteria for evaluating\
    \ an incumbent.\n      The nominating committee does not select the open positions\
    \ to be\n      reviewed; it is instructed as to which positions to review.\n \
    \     The nominating committee will be given the title of the positions\n    \
    \  to be reviewed and a brief summary of the desired expertise of the\n      candidate\
    \ that is nominated to fill each position.\n      Incumbents must notify the nominating\
    \ committee if they wish to be\n      nominated.\n      The nominating committee\
    \ does not confirm its candidates; it\n      presents its candidates to the appropriate\
    \ confirming body as\n      indicated below.\n      A superior candidate is one\
    \ who the nominating committee believes\n      would contribute in such a way\
    \ as to improve or enhance the body\n      to which he or she is nominated.\n\
    \   3. One-half of each of the then current IESG and IAB positions is\n      selected\
    \ to be reviewed each year.\n      The intent of this rule to ensure the review\
    \ of approximately\n      one-half of each of the IESG and IAB sitting members\
    \ each year.\n      It is recognized that circumstances may exist that will require\n\
    \      the nominating committee to review more or less than one-half of\n    \
    \  the current positions, e.g., if the IESG or IAB have re-organized\n      prior\
    \ to this process and created new positions, if there are an\n      odd number\
    \ of current positions, or if a member unexpectedly\n      resigns.\n   4. Confirmed\
    \ candidates are expected to serve at least a 2 year term.\n      The intent of\
    \ this rule is to ensure that members of the IESG and\n      IAB serve the number\
    \ of years that best facilitates the review of\n      one-half of the members\
    \ each year.\n      The term of a confirmed candidate selected according to the\
    \ mid-\n      term vacancy rules may be less than 2 years, as stated elsewhere\n\
    \      in this document.\n      It is consistent with this rule for the nominating\
    \ committee to\n      choose one or more of the currently open positions to which\
    \ it may\n      assign a term of not more than 3 years in order to ensure the\n\
    \      ideal application of this rule in the future.\n      It is consistent with\
    \ this rule for the nominating committee to\n      choose one or more of the currently\
    \ open positions that share\n      responsibilities with other positions (both\
    \ those being reviewed\n      and those sitting) to which it may assign a term\
    \ of not more than\n      3 years to ensure that all such members will not be\
    \ reviewed at\n      the same time.\n      All sitting member terms end during\
    \ the First IETF meeting\n      corresponding to the end of the term for which\
    \ they were\n      confirmed.  All confirmed candidate terms begin during the\
    \ First\n      IETF meeting corresponding to the beginning of the term for which\n\
    \      they were confirmed.\n      For confirmed candidates of the IESG the terms\
    \ begin no later than\n      when the currently sitting members' terms end on\
    \ the last day of\n      the meeting.  A term may begin or end no sooner than\
    \ the first day\n      of the meeting and no later than the last day of the meeting\
    \ as\n      determined by the mutual agreement of the currently sitting member\n\
    \      and the confirmed candidate.  A confirmed candidate's term may\n      overlap\
    \ the sitting member's term during the meeting as determined\n      by their mutual\
    \ agreement.\n      For confirmed candidates of the IAB the terms overlap with\
    \ the\n      terms of the sitting members for the entire week of the meeting.\n\
    \      For candidates confirmed under the mid-term vacancy rules, the\n      term\
    \ begins as soon as possible after the confirmation.\n   5. Mid-term vacancies\
    \ are filled by the same rules as documented here\n      with four qualifications.\n\
    \      First, when there is only one official nominating committee, the\n    \
    \  body with the mid-term vacancy relegates the responsibility to\n      fill\
    \ the vacancy to it.  If the mid-term vacancy occurs during the\n      period\
    \ of time that the term of the prior year's nominating\n      committee overlaps\
    \ with the term of the current year's nominating\n      committee, the body with\
    \ the mid-term vacancy must relegate the\n      responsibility to fill the vacancy\
    \ to the prior year's nominating\n      committee.\n      Second, if it is the\
    \ case that the nominating committee is\n      reconvening to fill the mid-term\
    \ vacancy, then the completion of\n      the candidate selection and confirmation\
    \ process is due within 6\n      weeks, with all other time periods otherwise\
    \ unspecified prorated\n      accordingly.\n      Third, the confirming body has\
    \ two weeks from the day it is\n      notified of a candidate to reject the candidate,\
    \ otherwise the\n      candidate is assumed to have been confirmed.\n      Fourth,\
    \ the term of the confirmed candidate will be either:\n      1. the remainder\
    \ of the term of the open position if that\n         remainder is not less than\
    \ one year.\n      2. the remainder of the term of the open position plus the\
    \ next 2\n         year term if that remainder is less than one year.\n      \
    \   In both cases a year is the period of time from a First IETF\n         meeting\
    \ to the next First IETF meeting.\n   6. All deliberations and supporting information\
    \ that relates to\n      specific nominees, candidates, and confirmed candidates\
    \ are\n      confidential.\n      The nominating committee and confirming body\
    \ members will be\n      exposed to confidential information as a result of their\n\
    \      deliberations, their interactions with those they consult, and\n      from\
    \ those who provide requested supporting information.  All\n      members and\
    \ all other participants are expected to handle this\n      information in a manner\
    \ consistent with its sensitivity.\n      It is consistent with this rule for\
    \ current nominating committee\n      members who have served on prior nominating\
    \ committees to advise\n      the current committee on deliberations and results\
    \ of the prior\n      committee, as necessary and appropriate.\n   7. Unless otherwise\
    \ specified, the advice and consent model is used\n      throughout the process.\
    \  This model is characterized as follows.\n      1. The IETF Executive Director\
    \ informs the nominating committee of\n         the IESG and IAB positions to\
    \ be reviewed.\n         The IESG and IAB are responsible for providing summary\
    \ of the\n         expertise desired of the candidates selected for their\n  \
    \       respective open positions to the Executive Director.  The\n         summaries\
    \ are provided to the nominating committee for its\n         consideration.\n\
    \      2. The nominating committee selects candidates based on its\n         understanding\
    \ of the IETF community's consensus of the\n         qualifications required and\
    \ advises each confirming body of its\n         respective candidates.\n     \
    \ 3. The confirming bodies review their respective candidates, they\n        \
    \ may at their discretion communicate with the nominating\n         committee,\
    \ and then consent to some, all, or none of the\n         candidates.\n      \
    \   The sitting IAB members review the IESG candidates.\n         The Internet\
    \ Society Board of Trustees reviews the IAB\n         candidates.\n         The\
    \ confirming bodies conduct their review using all\n         information and any\
    \ means acceptable to them, including but not\n         limited to the supporting\
    \ information provided by the\n         nominating committee, information known\
    \ personally to members\n         of the confirming bodies and shared within the\
    \ confirming body,\n         the results of interactions within the confirming\
    \ bodies, and\n         the confirming bodies interpretation of what is in the\
    \ best\n         interests of the IETF community.\n         If all of the candidates\
    \ are confirmed, the job of the\n         nominating committee with respect to\
    \ those open positions is\n         complete.\n         If some or none of the\
    \ candidates submitted to a confirming\n         body are confirmed, the confirming\
    \ body should communicate with\n         the nominating committee both to explain\
    \ the reason why all the\n         candidates were not confirmed and to understand\
    \ the nominating\n         committee's rationale for its candidates.\n       \
    \  The confirming body may reject individual candidates, in which\n         case\
    \ the nominating committee must select alternate candidates\n         for the\
    \ rejected candidates.\n         Any additional time required by the nominating\
    \ committee should\n         not exceed its maximum time allotment.\n      4.\
    \ A confirming body decides whether it confirms each candidate\n         using\
    \ a confirmation decision rule chosen by the confirming\n         body.\n    \
    \     If a confirming body has no specific confirmation decision\n         rule,\
    \ then confirming a given candidate should require at least\n         one-half\
    \ of the confirming body's sitting members to agree to\n         that confirmation.\n\
    \         The decision may be made by conducting a formal vote, by\n         asserting\
    \ consensus based on informal exchanges (e.g., email),\n         or by any other\
    \ mechanism that is used to conduct the normal\n         business of the confirming\
    \ body.\n         Regardless of which decision rule the confirming body uses,\
    \ any\n         candidate that is not confirmed under that rule is considered\n\
    \         to be rejected.\n         The confirming body must make its decision\
    \ within a reasonable\n         time frame.  The results from the confirming body\
    \ must be\n         reported promptly to the nominating committee.\n   8. The\
    \ following rules apply to nominees candidates who are currently\n      sitting\
    \ members of the IESG or IAB, and who are not sitting in an\n      open position\
    \ being filled by the nominating committee.\n      The confirmation of a candidate\
    \ to an open position does not\n      automatically create a vacancy in the IESG\
    \ or IAB position\n      currently occupied by the candidate.  The mid-term vacancy\
    \ can not\n      exist until, first, the candidate formally resigns from the\n\
    \      current position and, second, the body with the vacancy formally\n    \
    \  decides for itself that it wants the nominating committee to fill\n      the\
    \ mid-term vacancy according to the rules for a mid-term vacancy\n      documented\
    \ elsewhere in this document.\n      The resignation should be effective as of\
    \ when the term of the new\n      position begins.  The resignation may remain\
    \ confidential to the\n      IAB, IESG, and nominating committee until the confirmed\
    \ candidate\n      is announced for the new position.  The process, according\
    \ to\n      rules set out elsewhere in this document, of filling the seat\n  \
    \    vacated by the confirmed candidate may begin as soon as the\n      vacancy\
    \ is publicly announced.\n      Filling a mid-term vacancy is a separate and independent\
    \ action\n      from the customary action of filling open positions.  In\n   \
    \   particular, a nominating committee must complete its job with\n      respect\
    \ to filling the open positions and then separately proceed\n      with the task\
    \ of filling the mid-term vacancy according to the\n      rules for a mid-term\
    \ vacancy documented elsewhere in this\n      document.\n      However, the following\
    \ exception is permitted in the case where\n      the candidate for an open position\
    \ is currently a sitting member\n      of the IAB.  It is consistent with these\
    \ rules for the\n      announcements of a resignation of a sitting member of the\
    \ IAB and\n      of the confirmed candidate for the mid-term vacancy created by\n\
    \      that sitting member on the IAB to all occur at the same time as\n     \
    \ long as the actual sequence of events that occurred did so in the\n      following\
    \ order.\n      *  The nominating committee completes the advice and consent\n\
    \         process for the open position being filled by the candidate\n      \
    \   currently sitting on the IAB.\n      *  The newly confirmed candidate resigns\
    \ from their current\n         position on the IAB.\n      *  The IAB with the\
    \ new mid-term vacancy requests that the\n         nominating committee fill the\
    \ position.\n      *  The Executive Director of the IETF informs the nominating\n\
    \         committee of the mid-term vacancy.\n      *  The nominating committee\
    \ acts on the request to fill the mid-\n         term vacancy.\n   9. All announcements\
    \ must be made using at least the mechanism used\n      by the IETF Secretariat\
    \ for its announcements, including a notice\n      on the IETF web site.\n   \
    \   As of the publication of this document, the current mechanism is\n      an\
    \ email message to both the \"ietf\" and the \"ietf-announce\"\n      mailing\
    \ lists.\n"
- title: 4.  Nominating Committee Selection
  contents:
  - "4.  Nominating Committee Selection\n   The following set of rules apply to the\
    \ creation of the nominating\n   committee and the selection of its members.\n\
    \   1.  The completion of the process of selecting and organizing the\n      \
    \ members of the nominating committee is due within 3 months.\n       The completion\
    \ of the selection and organization process is due\n       at least one month\
    \ prior to the Third IETF.  This ensures the\n       nominating committee is fully\
    \ operational and available for\n       interviews and consultation during the\
    \ Third IETF.\n   2.  The term of a nominating committee is expected to be 15\
    \ months.\n       It is the intent of this rule that the end of a nominating\n\
    \       committee's term overlap by approximately three months the\n       beginning\
    \ of the term of the next nominating committee.\n       The term of a nominating\
    \ committee begins when its members are\n       officially announced.  The term\
    \ ends at the Third IETF (not three\n       meetings), i.e., the IETF meeting\
    \ after the next nominating\n       committee's term begins.\n       A term is\
    \ expected to begin at least two months prior to the\n       Third IETF to ensure\
    \ the nominating committee has at least one\n       month to get organized before\
    \ preparing for the Third IETF.\n       A nominating committee is expected to\
    \ complete any work-in-\n       progress before it is dissolved at the end of\
    \ its term.\n       During the period of time that the terms of the nominating\n\
    \       committees overlap, all mid-term vacancies are to be relegated to\n  \
    \     the prior year's nominating committee.  The prior year's\n       nominating\
    \ committee has no other responsibilities during the\n       overlap period. \
    \ At all times other than the overlap period there\n       is exactly one official\
    \ nominating committee and it is\n       responsible for all mid-term vacancies.\n\
    \       When the prior year's nominating committee is filling a mid-term\n   \
    \    vacancy during the period of time that the terms overlap, the\n       nominating\
    \ committees operate independently.  However, some\n       coordination is needed\
    \ between them.  Since the prior year's\n       Chair is a non-voting advisor\
    \ to the current nominating committee\n       the coordination is expected to\
    \ be straightforward.\n   3.  The nominating committee comprises at least a Chair,\
    \ 10 voting\n       volunteers, 3 liaisons, and an advisor.\n       Any committee\
    \ member may propose the addition of an advisor to\n       participate in some\
    \ or all of the deliberations of the committee.\n       The addition must be approved\
    \ by the committee according to its\n       established voting mechanism.  Advisors\
    \ participate as\n       individuals.\n       Any committee member may propose\
    \ the addition of a liaison from\n       other unrepresented organizations to\
    \ participate in some or all\n       of the deliberations of the committee.  The\
    \ addition must be\n       approved by the committee according to its established\
    \ voting\n       mechanism.  Liaisons participate as representatives of their\n\
    \       respective organizations.\n       The Chair is selected according to rules\
    \ stated elsewhere in this\n       document.\n       The 10 voting volunteers\
    \ are selected according to rules stated\n       elsewhere in this document.\n\
    \       The IESG and IAB liaisons are selected according to rules stated\n   \
    \    elsewhere in this document.\n       The Internet Society Board of Trustees\
    \ may appoint a liaison to\n       the nominating committee at its own discretion.\n\
    \       The Chair of last year's nominating committee serves as an\n       advisor\
    \ according to rules stated elsewhere in this document.\n       None of the Chair,\
    \ liaisons, or advisors vote on the selection of\n       candidates.  They do\
    \ vote on all other issues before the\n       committee unless otherwise specified\
    \ in this document.\n   4.  The Chair of the nominating committee is responsible\
    \ for ensuring\n       the nominating committee completes its assigned duties\
    \ in a\n       timely fashion and performs in the best interests of the IETF\n\
    \       community.\n       The Chair must be thoroughly familiar with the rules\
    \ and guidance\n       indicated throughout this document.  The Chair must ensure\
    \ the\n       nominating committee completes its assigned duties in a manner\n\
    \       that is consistent with this document.\n       The Chair must attest by\
    \ proclamation at a plenary session of the\n       First IETF that the results\
    \ of the committee represent its best\n       effort and the best interests of\
    \ the IETF community.\n       The Chair does not vote on the selection of candidates.\n\
    \   5.  The Internet Society President appoints the Chair, who must meet\n   \
    \    the same requirements for membership in the nominating committee\n      \
    \ as a voting volunteer.\n       The nominating committee Chair must agree to\
    \ invest the time\n       necessary to ensure that the nominating committee completes\
    \ its\n       assigned duties and to perform in the best interests of the IETF\n\
    \       community in that role.\n       The appointment is due no later than the\
    \ Second IETF meeting to\n       ensure it can be announced during a plenary session\
    \ at that\n       meeting.  The completion of the appointment is necessary to\n\
    \       ensure the annual process can complete at the time specified\n       elsewhere\
    \ in this document.\n   6.  A Chair, in consultation with the Internet Society\
    \ President, may\n       appoint a temporary substitute for the Chair position.\n\
    \       There are a variety of ordinary circumstances that may arise from\n  \
    \     time to time that could result in a Chair being unavailable to\n       oversee\
    \ the activities of the committee.  The Chair, in\n       consultation with the\
    \ Internet Society President, may appoint a\n       substitute from a pool comprised\
    \ of the liaisons currently\n       serving on the committee and the prior year's\
    \ Chair or designee.\n       Any such appointment must be temporary and does not\
    \ absolve the\n       Chair of any or all responsibility for ensuring the nominating\n\
    \       committee completes its assigned duties in a timely fashion.\n   7.  Liaisons\
    \ are responsible for ensuring the nominating committee in\n       general and\
    \ the Chair in particular execute their assigned duties\n       in the best interests\
    \ of the IETF community.\n       Liaisons are expected to represent the views\
    \ of their respective\n       organizations during the deliberations of the committee.\
    \  They\n       should provide information as requested or when they believe it\n\
    \       would be helpful to the committee.\n       Liaisons from the IESG and\
    \ IAB are expected to provide\n       information to the nominating committee\
    \ regarding the operation,\n       responsibility, and composition of their respective\
    \ bodies.\n       Liaisons are expected to convey questions from the committee\
    \ to\n       their respective organizations and responses to those questions\n\
    \       to the committee, as requested by the committee.\n       Liaisons from\
    \ the IESG, IAB, and Internet Society Board of\n       Trustees (if one was appointed)\
    \ are expected to review the\n       operation and executing process of the nominating\
    \ committee and\n       to report any concerns or issues to the Chair of the nominating\n\
    \       committee immediately.  If they can not resolve the issue between\n  \
    \     themselves, liaisons must report it according to the dispute\n       resolution\
    \ process stated elsewhere in this document.\n       Liaisons from confirming\
    \ bodies are expected to assist the\n       committee in preparing the testimony\
    \ it is required to provide\n       with its candidates.\n       Liaisons may\
    \ have other nominating committee responsibilities as\n       required by their\
    \ respective organizations or requested by the\n       nominating committee, except\
    \ that such responsibilities may not\n       conflict with any other provisions\
    \ of this document.\n       Liaisons do not vote on the selection of candidates.\n\
    \   8.  The sitting IAB and IESG members each appoint a liaison from\n       their\
    \ current membership, someone who is not sitting in an open\n       position,\
    \ to serve on the nominating committee.\n   9.  An advisor is responsible for\
    \ such duties as specified by the\n       invitation that resulted in the appointment.\n\
    \       Advisors do not vote on the selection of candidates.\n   10. The Chair\
    \ of the prior year's nominating committee serves as an\n       advisor to the\
    \ current committee.\n       The prior year's Chair is expected to review the\
    \ actions and\n       activities of the current Chair and to report any concerns\
    \ or\n       issues to the nominating committee Chair immediately.  If they\n\
    \       can not resolve the issue between themselves, the prior year's\n     \
    \  Chair must report it according to the dispute resolution process\n       stated\
    \ elsewhere in this document.\n       The prior year's Chair may select a designee\
    \ from a pool composed\n       of the voting volunteers of the prior year's committee\
    \ and all\n       prior Chairs if the Chair is unavailable.  If the prior year's\n\
    \       Chair is unavailable or is unable or unwilling to make such a\n      \
    \ designation in a timely fashion, the Chair of the current year's\n       committee\
    \ may select a designee in consultation with the Internet\n       Society President.\n\
    \       Selecting a prior year's committee member as the designee permits\n  \
    \     the experience of the prior year's deliberations to be readily\n       available\
    \ to the current committee.  Selecting an earlier prior\n       year Chair as\
    \ the designee permits the experience of being a\n       Chair as well as that\
    \ Chair's committee deliberations to be\n       readily available to the current\
    \ committee.\n       All references to \"prior year's Chair\" in this document\
    \ refer to\n       the person serving in that role, whether it is the actual prior\n\
    \       year's Chair or a designee.\n   11. Voting volunteers are responsible\
    \ for completing the tasks of the\n       nominating committee in a timely fashion.\n\
    \       Each voting volunteer is expected to participate in all\n       activities\
    \ of the nominating committee with a level of effort\n       approximately equal\
    \ to all other voting volunteers.  Specific\n       tasks to be completed are\
    \ established and managed by the Chair\n       according to rules stated elsewhere\
    \ in this document.\n   12. The Chair must establish and announce milestones for\
    \ the\n       selection of the nominating committee members.\n       There is\
    \ a defined time period during which the selection process\n       is due to be\
    \ completed.  The Chair must establish a set of\n       milestones which, if met\
    \ in a timely fashion, will result in the\n       completion of the process on\
    \ time.\n   13. The Chair obtains the list of IESG and IAB positions to be\n \
    \      reviewed and announces it along with a solicitation for names of\n    \
    \   volunteers from the IETF community willing to serve on the\n       nominating\
    \ committee.\n       The solicitation must permit the community at least 30 days\n\
    \       during which they may choose to volunteer to be selected for the\n   \
    \    nominating committee.\n       The list of open positions is published with\
    \ the solicitation to\n       facilitate community members choosing between volunteering\
    \ for an\n       open position and volunteering for the nominating committee.\n\
    \   14. Members of the IETF community must have attended at least 3 of\n     \
    \  the last 5 IETF meetings in order to volunteer.\n       The 5 meetings are\
    \ the five most recent meetings that ended prior\n       to the date on which\
    \ the solicitation for nominating committee\n       volunteers was submitted for\
    \ distribution to the IETF community.\n       The IETF Secretariat is responsible\
    \ for confirming that\n       volunteers have met the attendance requirement.\n\
    \       Volunteers must provide their full name, email address, and\n       primary\
    \ company or organization affiliation (if any) when\n       volunteering.\n  \
    \     Volunteers are expected to be familiar with the IETF processes\n       and\
    \ procedures, which are readily learned by active participation\n       in a working\
    \ group and especially by serving as a document editor\n       or working group\
    \ chair.\n   15. Members of the Internet Society Board of Trustees, sitting\n\
    \       members of the IAB, and sitting members of the IESG may not\n       volunteer\
    \ to serve on the nominating committee.\n   16. The Chair announces both the list\
    \ of the pool of volunteers from\n       which the 10 voting volunteers will be\
    \ randomly selected and the\n       method with which the selection will be completed.\n\
    \       The announcement should be made at least 1 week prior to the date\n  \
    \     on which the random selection will occur.\n       The pool of volunteers\
    \ must be enumerated or otherwise indicated\n       according to the needs of\
    \ the selection method to be used.\n       The announcement must specify the data\
    \ that will be used as input\n       to the selection method.  The method must\
    \ depend on random data\n       whose value is not known or available until the\
    \ date on which the\n       random selection will occur.\n       It must be possible\
    \ to independently verify that the selection\n       method used is both fair\
    \ and unbiased.  A method is fair if each\n       eligible volunteer is equally\
    \ likely to be selected.  A method is\n       unbiased if no one can influence\
    \ its outcome in favor of a\n       specific outcome.\n       It must be possible\
    \ to repeat the selection method, either\n       through iteration or by restarting\
    \ in such a way as to remain\n       fair and unbiased.  This is necessary to\
    \ replace selected\n       volunteers should they become unavailable after selection.\n\
    \       The selection method must produce an ordered list of volunteers.\n   \
    \    One possible selection method is described in RFC 2777 [1].\n   17. The Chair\
    \ randomly selects the 10 voting volunteers from the pool\n       of names of\
    \ volunteers and announces the members of the\n       nominating committee.\n\
    \       No more than two volunteers with the same primary affiliation may\n  \
    \     be selected for the nominating committee.  The Chair reviews the\n     \
    \  primary affiliation of each volunteer selected by the method in\n       turn.\
    \  If the primary affiliation for a volunteer is the same as\n       two previously\
    \ selected volunteers, that volunteer is removed\n       from consideration and\
    \ the method is repeated to identify the\n       next eligible volunteer.\n  \
    \     There must be at least two announcements of all members of the\n       nominating\
    \ committee.\n       The first announcement should occur as soon after the random\n\
    \       selection as is reasonable for the Chair.  The community must\n      \
    \ have at least 1 week during which any member may challenge the\n       results\
    \ of the random selection.\n       The challenge must be made in writing (email\
    \ is acceptable) to\n       the Chair.  The Chair has 48 hours to review the challenge\
    \ and\n       offer a resolution to the member.  If the resolution is not\n  \
    \     accepted by the member, that member may report the challenge\n       according\
    \ to the dispute resolution process stated elsewhere in\n       this document.\n\
    \       If a selected volunteer, upon reading the announcement with the\n    \
    \   list of selected volunteers, finds that two or more other\n       volunteers\
    \ have the same affiliation, then the volunteer should\n       notify the Chair\
    \ who will determine the appropriate action.\n       During at least the 1 week\
    \ challenge period the Chair must\n       contact each of the members and confirm\
    \ their willingness and\n       availability to serve.  The Chair should make\
    \ every reasonable\n       effort to contact each member.\n       *  If the Chair\
    \ is unable to contact a liaison the problem is\n          referred to the respective\
    \ organization to resolve.  The Chair\n          should allow a reasonable amount\
    \ of time for the organization\n          to resolve the problem and then may\
    \ proceed without the\n          liaison.\n       *  If the Chair is unable to\
    \ contact an advisor the Chair may\n          elect to proceed without the advisor,\
    \ except for the prior\n          year's Chair for whom the Chair must consult\
    \ with the Internet\n          Society President as stated elsewhere in this document.\n\
    \       *  If the Chair is unable to contact a voting volunteer the Chair\n  \
    \        must repeat the random selection process in order to replace\n      \
    \    the unavailable volunteer.  There should be at least 1 day\n          between\
    \ the announcement of the iteration and the selection\n          process.\n  \
    \     After at least 1 week and confirming that 10 voting volunteers\n       are\
    \ ready to serve, the Chair makes the second announcement of\n       the members\
    \ of the nominating committee, which officially begins\n       the term of the\
    \ nominating committee.\n   18. The Chair works with the members of the committee\
    \ to organize\n       itself in preparation for completing its assigned duties.\n\
    \       The committee has approximately one month during which it can\n      \
    \ self-organize.  Its responsibilities during this time include but\n       are\
    \ not limited to the following.\n       *  Setting up a regular teleconference\
    \ schedule.\n       *  Setting up an internal web site.\n       *  Setting up\
    \ a mailing list for internal discussions.\n       *  Setting up an email address\
    \ for receiving community input.\n       *  Establishing operational procedures.\n\
    \       *  Establishing milestones in order to monitor the progress of\n     \
    \     the selection process.\n"

  - "5.  Nominating Committee Operation\n   The following rules apply to the operation\
    \ of the nominating\n   committee.  If necessary, a paragraph discussing the interpretation\n\
    \   of each rule is included.\n   The rules are organized approximately in the\
    \ order in which they\n   would be invoked.\n   1.  All rules and special circumstances\
    \ not otherwise specified are\n       at the discretion of the committee.\n  \
    \     Exceptional circumstances will occasionally arise during the\n       normal\
    \ operation of the nominating committee.  This rule is\n       intended to foster\
    \ the continued forward progress of the\n       committee.\n       Any member\
    \ of the committee may propose a rule for adoption by\n       the committee. \
    \ The rule must be approved by the committee\n       according to its established\
    \ voting mechanism.\n       All members of the committee should consider whether\
    \ the\n       exception is worthy of mention in the next revision of this\n  \
    \     document and follow-up accordingly.\n   2.  The completion of the process\
    \ of selecting candidates to be\n       confirmed by their respective confirming\
    \ body is due within 3\n       months.\n       The completion of the selection\
    \ process is due at least two\n       month's prior to the First IETF.  This ensures\
    \ the nominating\n       committee has sufficient time to complete the confirmation\n\
    \       process.\n   3.  The completion of the process of confirming the candidates\
    \ is due\n       within 1 month.\n       The completion of the confirmation process\
    \ is due at least one\n       month prior to the First IETF.\n   4.  The Chair\
    \ must establish for the nominating committee a set of\n       milestones for\
    \ the candidate selection and confirmation process.\n       There is a defined\
    \ time period during which the candidate\n       selection and confirmation process\
    \ must be completed.  The Chair\n       must establish a set of milestones which,\
    \ if met in a timely\n       fashion, will result in the completion of the process\
    \ on time.\n       The Chair should allow time for iterating the activities of\
    \ the\n       committee if one or more candidates is not confirmed.\n       The\
    \ Chair should ensure that all committee members are aware of\n       the milestones.\n\
    \   5.  The Chair must establish a voting mechanism.\n       The committee must\
    \ be able to objectively determine when a\n       decision has been made during\
    \ its deliberations.  The criteria\n       for determining closure must be established\
    \ and known to all\n       members of the nominating committee.\n   6.  At least\
    \ a quorum of committee members must participate in a\n       vote.\n       Only\
    \ voting volunteers vote on a candidate selection.  For a\n       candidate selection\
    \ vote a quorum is comprised of at least 7 of\n       the voting volunteers.\n\
    \       At all other times a quorum is present if at least 75% of the\n      \
    \ nominating committee members are participating.\n   7.  Any member of the nominating\
    \ committee may propose to the\n       committee that any other member except\
    \ the Chair be recalled.\n       The process for recalling the Chair is defined\
    \ elsewhere in this\n       document.\n       There are a variety of ordinary\
    \ circumstances that may arise that\n       could result in one or more members\
    \ of the committee being\n       unavailable to complete their assigned duties,\
    \ for example health\n       concerns, family issues, or a change of priorities\
    \ at work.  A\n       committee member may choose to resign for unspecified personal\n\
    \       reasons.  In addition, the committee may not function well as a\n    \
    \   group because a member may be disruptive or otherwise\n       uncooperative.\n\
    \       Regardless of the circumstances, if individual committee members\n   \
    \    can not work out their differences between themselves, the entire\n     \
    \  committee may be called upon to discuss and review the\n       circumstances.\
    \  If a resolution is not forthcoming a vote may be\n       conducted.  A member\
    \ may be recalled if at least a quorum of all\n       committee members agree,\
    \ including the vote of the member being\n       recalled.\n       If a liaison\
    \ member is recalled the committee must notify the\n       affected organization\
    \ and must allow a reasonable amount of time\n       for a replacement to be identified\
    \ by the organization before\n       proceeding.\n       If an advisor member\
    \ other than the prior year's Chair is\n       recalled, the committee may choose\
    \ to proceed without the\n       advisor.  In the case of the prior year's Chair,\
    \ the Internet\n       Society President must be notified and the current Chair\
    \ must be\n       allowed a reasonable amount of time to consult with the Internet\n\
    \       Society President to identify a replacement before proceeding.\n     \
    \  If a single voting volunteer position on the nominating committee\n       is\
    \ vacated, regardless of the circumstances, the committee may\n       choose to\
    \ proceed with only 9 voting volunteers at its own\n       discretion.  In all\
    \ other cases a new voting member must be\n       selected, and the Chair must\
    \ repeat the random selection process\n       including an announcement of the\
    \ iteration prior to the actual\n       selection as stated elsewhere in this\
    \ document.\n       A change in the primary affiliation of a voting volunteer\
    \ during\n       the term of the nominating committee is not a cause to request\n\
    \       the recall of that volunteer, even if the change would result in\n   \
    \    more than two voting volunteers with the same affiliation.\n   8.  Only the\
    \ prior year's Chair may request the recall of the current\n       Chair.\n  \
    \     It is the responsibility of the prior year's Chair to ensure the\n     \
    \  current Chair completes the assigned tasks in a manner consistent\n       with\
    \ this document and in the best interests of the IETF\n       community.\n   \
    \    Any member of the committee who has an issue or concern regarding\n     \
    \  the Chair should report it to the prior year's Chair immediately.\n       The\
    \ prior year's Chair is expected to report it to the Chair\n       immediately.\
    \  If they can not resolve the issue between\n       themselves, the prior year's\
    \ Chair must report it according to\n       the dispute resolution process stated\
    \ elsewhere in this document.\n   9.  All members of the nominating committee\
    \ may participate in all\n       deliberations.\n       The emphasis of this rule\
    \ is that no member can be explicitly\n       excluded from any deliberation.\
    \  However, a member may\n       individually choose not to participate in a deliberation.\n\
    \   10. The Chair announces the open positions to be reviewed, the\n       desired\
    \ expertise provided by the IETF Executive Director, and\n       the call for\
    \ nominees.\n       The call for nominees must include a request for comments\n\
    \       regarding the past performance of incumbents, which will be\n       considered\
    \ during the deliberations of the nominating committee.\n       The call must\
    \ request that a nomination include a valid, working\n       email address, a\
    \ telephone number, or both for the nominee.  The\n       nomination must include\
    \ the set of skills or expertise the\n       nominator believes the nominee has\
    \ that would be desirable.\n   11. Any member of the IETF community may nominate\
    \ any member of the\n       IETF community for any open position, whose eligibility\
    \ to serve\n       will be confirmed by the nominating committee.\n       A self-nomination\
    \ is permitted.\n       Nominating committee members are not eligible to be considered\n\
    \       for filling any open position by the nominating committee on\n       which\
    \ they serve.  They become ineligible as soon as the term of\n       the nominating\
    \ committee on which they serve officially begins.\n       They remain ineligible\
    \ for the duration of that nominating\n       committee's term.\n       Although\
    \ each nominating committee's term overlaps with the\n       following nominating\
    \ committee's term, nominating committee\n       members are eligible for nomination\
    \ by the following committee if\n       not otherwise disqualified.\n       Members\
    \ of the IETF community who were recalled from any IESG or\n       IAB position\
    \ during the previous two years are not eligible to be\n       considered for\
    \ filling any open position.\n   12. The nominating committee selects candidates\
    \ based on its\n       understanding of the IETF community's consensus of the\n\
    \       qualifications required to fill the open positions.\n       The intent\
    \ of this rule is to ensure that the nominating\n       committee consults with\
    \ a broad base of the IETF community for\n       input to its deliberations. \
    \ In particular, the nominating\n       committee must determine if the desired\
    \ expertise for the open\n       positions matches its understanding of the qualifications\
    \ desired\n       by the IETF community.\n       The consultations are permitted\
    \ to include names of nominees, if\n       all parties to the consultation agree\
    \ to observe the same\n       confidentiality rules as the nominating committee\
    \ itself.\n       A broad base of the community should include the existing members\n\
    \       of the IAB and IESG, especially sitting members who share\n       responsibilities\
    \ with open positions, e.g., co-Area Directors,\n       and working group chairs,\
    \ especially those in the areas with open\n       positions.\n       Only voting\
    \ volunteer members vote to select candidates.\n   13. Nominees should be advised\
    \ that they are being considered and\n       must consent to their nomination\
    \ prior to being chosen as\n       candidates.\n       Although the nominating\
    \ committee will make every reasonable\n       effort to contact and to remain\
    \ in contact with nominees, any\n       nominee whose contact information changes\
    \ during the process and\n       who wishes to still be considered should inform\
    \ the nominating\n       committee of the changes.\n       A nominee's consent\
    \ must be written (email is acceptable) and\n       must include a commitment\
    \ to provide the resources necessary to\n       fill the open position and an\
    \ assurance that the nominee will\n       perform the duties of the position for\
    \ which they are being\n       considered in the best interests of the IETF community.\n\
    \       Consenting to a nomination must occur prior to a nominee being a\n   \
    \    candidate and may occur as soon after the nomination as needed by\n     \
    \  the nominating committee.\n       Consenting to a nomination must not imply\
    \ the nominee will be a\n       candidate.\n       The nominating committee should\
    \ help nominees provide\n       justification to their employers.\n   14. The\
    \ nominating committee advises the confirming bodies of their\n       candidates,\
    \ specifying a single candidate for each open position\n       and testifying\
    \ as to how each candidate meets the qualifications\n       of an open position.\n\
    \       For each candidate, the testimony must include a brief statement\n   \
    \    of the qualifications for the position that is being filled,\n       which\
    \ may be exactly the expertise that was requested.  If the\n       qualifications\
    \ differ from the expertise originally requested a\n       brief statement explaining\
    \ the difference must be included.\n       The testimony may include either or\
    \ both of a brief resume of the\n       candidate and a brief summary of the deliberations\
    \ of the\n       nominating committee.\n   15. Confirmed candidates must consent\
    \ to their confirmation and\n       rejected candidates and nominees must be notified\
    \ before\n       confirmed candidates are announced.\n       It is not necessary\
    \ to notify and get consent from all confirmed\n       candidates together.\n\
    \       A nominee may not know they were a candidate.  This permits a\n      \
    \ candidate to be rejected by a confirming body without the nominee\n       knowing\
    \ about the rejection.\n       Rejected nominees, who consented to their nomination,\
    \ and\n       rejected candidates must be notified prior to announcing the\n \
    \      confirmed candidates.\n       It is not necessary to announce all confirmed\
    \ candidates\n       together.\n       The nominating committee must ensure that\
    \ all confirmed\n       candidates are prepared to serve prior to announcing their\n\
    \       confirmation.\n   16. The nominating committee should archive the information\
    \ it has\n       collected or produced for a period of time not to exceed its\n\
    \       term.\n       The purpose of the archive is to assist the nominating committee\n\
    \       should it be necessary for it to fill a mid-term vacancy.\n       The\
    \ existence of an archive, how it is implemented, and what\n       information\
    \ to archive is at the discretion of the committee.\n       The decision must\
    \ be approved by a quorum of the voting volunteer\n       members.\n       The\
    \ implementation of the archive should make every reasonable\n       effort to\
    \ ensure that the confidentiality of the information it\n       contains is maintained.\n"

  contents:
  - "6.  Dispute Resolution Process\n   The dispute resolution process described here\
    \ is to be used as\n   indicated elsewhere in this document.  Its applicability\
    \ in other\n   circumstances is beyond the scope of this document.\n   The nominating\
    \ committee operates under a strict rule of\n   confidentiality.  For this reason\
    \ when process issues arise it is\n   best to make every reasonable effort to\
    \ resolve them within the\n   committee.  However, when circumstances do not permit\
    \ this or no\n   resolution is forthcoming, the process described here is to be\
    \ used.\n   The following rules apply to the process.\n   1.  The results of this\
    \ process are final and binding.  There is no\n       appeal.\n   2.  The process\
    \ begins with the submission of a request as described\n       below to the Internet\
    \ Society President.\n   3.  As soon as the process begins, the nominating committee\
    \ may\n       continue those activities that are unrelated to the issue to be\n\
    \       resolved except that it must not submit any candidates to a\n       confirming\
    \ body until the issue is resolved.\n   4.  All parties to the process are subject\
    \ to the same\n       confidentiality rules as each member of the nominating committee.\n\
    \   5.  The process should be completed within two weeks.\n   The process is as\
    \ follows:\n   1.  The party seeking resolution submits a written request (email\
    \ is\n       acceptable) to the Internet Society President detailing the issue\n\
    \       to be resolved.\n   2.  The Internet Society President appoints an arbiter\
    \ to investigate\n       and resolve the issue.  A self-appointment is permitted.\n\
    \   3.  The arbiter investigates the issue making every reasonable effort\n  \
    \     to understand both sides of the issue.  Since the arbiter is\n       subject\
    \ to the same confidentiality obligations as all nominating\n       committee\
    \ members, all members are expected to cooperate fully\n       with the arbiter\
    \ and to provide all relevant information to the\n       arbiter for review.\n\
    \   4.  After consultation with the two principal parties to the issue,\n    \
    \   the arbiter decides on a resolution.  Whatever actions are\n       necessary\
    \ to execute the resolution are immediately begun and\n       completed as quickly\
    \ as possible.\n   5.  The arbiter summarizes the issue, the resolution, and the\n\
    \       rationale for the resolution for the Internet Society President.\n   6.\
    \  In consultation with the Internet Society President, the arbiter\n       prepares\
    \ a report of the dispute and its resolution.  The report\n       should include\
    \ all information that in the judgment of the\n       arbiter does not violate\
    \ the confidentiality requirements of the\n       nominating committee.\n   7.\

  - "7.  Member Recall\n   The following rules apply to the recall process.  If necessary,\
    \ a\n   paragraph discussing the interpretation of each rule is included.\n  \
    \ 1.  At any time, at least 20 members of the IETF community, who are\n      \
    \ qualified to be voting members of a nominating committee, may\n       request\
    \ by signed petition (email is acceptable) to the Internet\n       Society President\
    \ the recall of any sitting IAB or IESG member.\n       All individual and collective\
    \ qualifications of nominating\n       committee eligibility are applicable, including\
    \ that no more than\n       two signatories may have the same primary affiliation.\n\
    \       Each signature must include a full name, email address, and\n       primary\
    \ company or organization affiliation.\n       The IETF Secretariat is responsible\
    \ for confirming that each\n       signatory is qualified to be a voting member\
    \ of a nominating\n       committee.  A valid petition must be signed by at least\
    \ 20\n       qualified signatories.\n       The petition must include a statement\
    \ of justification for the\n       recall and all relevant and appropriate supporting\
    \ documentation.\n       The petition and its signatories must be announced to\
    \ the IETF\n       community.\n   2.  Internet Society President shall appoint\
    \ a Recall Committee\n       Chair.\n       The Internet Society President must\
    \ not evaluate the recall\n       request.  It is explicitly the responsibility\
    \ of the IETF\n       community to evaluate the behavior of its leaders.\n   3.\
    \  The recall committee is created according to the same rules as is\n       the\
    \ nominating committee with the qualifications that both the\n       person being\
    \ investigated and the parties requesting the recall\n       must not be a member\
    \ of the recall committee in any capacity.\n   4.  The recall committee operates\
    \ according to the same rules as the\n       nominating committee with the qualification\
    \ that there is no\n       confirmation process.\n   5.  The recall committee\
    \ investigates the circumstances of the\n       justification for the recall and\
    \ votes on its findings.\n       The investigation must include at least both\
    \ an opportunity for\n       the member being recalled to present a written statement\
    \ and\n       consultation with third parties.\n   6.  A 3/4 majority of the members\
    \ who vote on the question is\n       required for a recall.\n   7.  If a sitting\
    \ member is recalled the open position is to be filled\n       according to the\
    \ mid-term vacancy rules.\n"
- title: 8.  Changes From RFC 2727
  contents:
  - "8.  Changes From RFC 2727\n   This section describes the substantive changes\
    \ from RFC 2727, listed\n   approximately in the order in which they appear in\
    \ the document.\n   1.  A section with definitions for words and phrases used\
    \ throughout\n       the document was inserted.\n   2.  The role of term limits\
    \ as a selection criterion was clarified.\n   3.  The nominating committee must\
    \ now be provided with a brief\n       description of the desirable expertise\
    \ for each candidate to be\n       nominated for each position.\n   4.  Because\
    \ of the overlapping terms of successive nominating\n       committees, the specific\
    \ committee responsible for a mid-term\n       vacancy was specified.\n   5. \
    \ The characterization of the advice and consent model was revised\n       to\
    \ permit the confirming body to communicate with the nominating\n       committee\
    \ during the approval process.\n   6.  A general rule was added to define that\
    \ all announcements are\n       made with the usual IETF Secretariat mechanism.\n\
    \   7.  Details regarding the expected timeline of the selection and\n       operation\
    \ of the committee were made even more explicit.  An\n       Appendix was added\
    \ that captures all the details for the\n       convenience of the reader.\n \
    \  8.  The term of the nominating committee was extended to\n       approximately\
    \ 15 months such that it explicitly overlaps by\n       approximately 3 months\
    \ the next year's nominating committee's\n       term.\n   9.  The terms voting\
    \ member and non-voting member were replaced by\n       voting volunteers, liaisons,\
    \ and advisors.  All members vote at\n       all times except that only voting\
    \ volunteers vote on a candidate\n       selection.\n   10. The responsibilities\
    \ of the Chair, liaisons, advisors, and voting\n       volunteers is now explicitly\
    \ stated.\n   11. Processes for recalling members of the committee were added.\n\
    \   12. Liaisons and advisors are no longer required to meet the usual\n     \
    \  requirements for nominating committee membership.\n   13. The Internet Society\
    \ Board of Trustees may appoint a non-voting\n       liaison.\n   14. The eligibility\
    \ qualifications for the nominating committee were\n       changed to require\
    \ attendance at 3 out of 5 of the last five\n       meetings, to require volunteers\
    \ to submit identifying contact\n       information, and to request that volunteers\
    \ be familiar with IETF\n       processes and procedures.\n   15. Some additional\
    \ clarification was added to the method used to\n       select volunteers.\n \
    \  16. The process for selecting the 10 voting volunteers had several\n      \
    \ clarifications and additional requirements added, including a\n       challenge\
    \ process and the requirement to disallow more than two\n       volunteers with\
    \ the same primary affiliation.\n   17. Nominations for open positions should\
    \ include both contact\n       information and a description of the skills or\
    \ expertise the\n       nominator believes the nominee possesses.\n   18. Nominees\
    \ are requested to keep the nominating committee informed\n       of changes in\
    \ their contact information.  Editorially, the\n       distinction between a nominee\
    \ and candidate was emphasized.\n   19. A description of a testimony to be provided\
    \ with each candidate\n       to a confirming body by the nominating committee\
    \ is specified.\n   20. The rules regarding the announcement of confirmed candidates\
    \ were\n       substantially rewritten to make it easier to understand.\n   21.\
    \ The nominating committee is permitted to keep an archive for the\n       duration\
    \ of its term of the information it collects and produces\n       for its own\
    \ internal use.\n   22. A dispute resolution process for addressing process concerns\
    \ was\n       added.\n   23. The process for recalling a sitting member of the\
    \ IAB and IESG\n       requires at least 20 eligible members of the IETF community\
    \ to\n       sign a petition requesting the recall.\n   24. The section on Security\
    \ Considerations was expanded.\n   25. Appendix A, Oral Tradition, has been added.\n\
    \   26. Appendix B, Nominating Committee Timeline, has been added as a\n     \

  contents:
  - "10.  Security Considerations\n   Any selection, confirmation, or recall process\

    \ of prospective\n   candidates.  The investigation may reveal confidential or\
    \ otherwise\n   private information about candidates to those participating in\

    \   must maintain the confidentiality of any and all information not\n   explicitly\
    \ identified as suitable for public dissemination.\n   When the nominating committee\
    \ decides it is necessary to share\n   confidential or otherwise private information\

- title: Appendix A.  Oral Tradition
  contents:
  - "Appendix A.  Oral Tradition\n   Over the years various nominating committees\
    \ have learned through\n   oral tradition passed on by liaisons that there are\
    \ certain\n   consistencies in the process and information considered during\n\
    \   deliberations.  Some items from that oral tradition are collected\n   here\
    \ to facilitate its consideration by future nominating committees.\n   1.  It\
    \ has been found that experience as an IETF Working Group Chair\n       or an\
    \ IRTF Research Group Chair is helpful in giving a nominee\n       experience\
    \ of what the job of an Area Director involves.  It also\n       helps a nominating\
    \ committee judge the technical, people, and\n       process management skills\
    \ of the nominee.\n   2.  No person should serve both on the IAB and as an Area\
    \ Director,\n       except the IETF Chair whose roles as an IAB member and Area\n\
    \       Director of the General Area are set out elsewhere.\n   3.  The strength\
    \ of the IAB is found in part in the balance of the\n       demographics of its\
    \ members (e.g., national distribution, years\n       of experience, gender, etc.),\
    \ the combined skill set of its\n       members, and the combined sectors (e.g.,\
    \ industry, academia,\n       etc.) represented by its members.\n   4.  There\
    \ are no term limits explicitly because the issue of\n       continuity versus\
    \ turnover should be evaluated each year\n       according to the expectations\
    \ of the IETF community, as it is\n       understood by each nominating committee.\n\
    \   5.  The number of nominating committee members with the same primary\n   \
    \    affiliation is limited in order to avoid the appearance of\n       improper\
    \ bias in choosing the leadership of the IETF.  Rather\n       than defining precise\
    \ rules for how to define \"affiliation\", the\n       IETF community depends\
    \ on the honor and integrity of the\n       participants to make the process work.\n"

    \ candidates by the nominating\n       committee.  Three months are allotted for\
    \ this process.\n   3.  Third is the confirmation of the candidates by their respective\n\
    \       confirming bodies.  One month is allotted for this process.\n   The following\
    \ figure captures the details of the milestones within\n   each component.  For\

    \       period.  The announcement must be done no later than 6 months and\n  \
    \     1 week prior to the First IETF (approx. August 22).\n   6.  During the challenge\
    \ period the Chair contacts each of the\n       committee members and confirms\
    \ their availability to participate.\n   7.  After the challenge period closes\

    \       October 1).\n   11. Over the next 3 months the nominating committee collects\
    \ input\n       and deliberates.  It should plan to conduct interviews and other\n\
    \       consultations during the Third IETF.  The committee is due to\n      \
    \ complete its candidate selection no later than 2 months prior to\n       the\
    \ First IETF (approx. January 1).\n   12. END the Selection of Candidates; BEGIN\
