  - "Overview and Rational\n   The following quality of service levels are available:\
    \ Concorde,\n   First, Business, and Coach.  Concorde class offers expedited data\n\
    \   delivery.  One major benefit to using Avian Carriers is that this is\n   the\
    \ only networking technology that earns frequent flyer miles, plus\n   the Concorde\
    \ and First classes of service earn 50% bonus miles per\n   packet.  Ostriches\
    \ are an alternate carrier that have much greater\n   bulk transfer capability\
    \ but provide slower delivery, and require the\n   use of bridges between domains.\n\
    \   The service level is indicated on a per-carrier basis by bar-code\n   markings\
    \ on the wing.  One implementation strategy is for a bar-code\n   reader to scan\
    \ each carrier as it enters the router and then enqueue\n   it in the proper queue,\
    \ gated to prevent exit until the proper time.\n   The carriers may sleep while\
    \ enqueued.\n   For secure networks, carriers may have classes Prime or Choice.\n\
    \   Prime carriers are self-keying when using public key encryption.\n   Some\
    \ distributors have been known to falsely classify Choice carriers\n   as Prime.\n\
    \   Packets MAY be marked for deletion using RED paint while enqueued.\n   Weighted\
    \ fair queueing (WFQ) MAY be implemented using scales, as\n   shown:\n       \

    \            |_____________________________________________\n   Avian carriers\
    \ normally bypass bridges and tunnels but will seek out\n   worm hole tunnels.\
    \  When carrying web traffic, the carriers may\n   digest the spiders, leaving\
    \ behind a more compact representation.\n   The carriers may be confused by mirrors.\n\
    \   Round-robin queueing is not recommended.  Robins make for well-tuned\n   networks\
    \ but do not support the necessary auto-homing feature.\n   A BOF was held at\
    \ the last IETF but only Avian Carriers were allowed\n   entry, so we don't know\
    \ the results other than we're sure they think\n   MPLS is great.  Our attempts\
    \ at attaching labels to the carriers have\n   been met with resistance.\n   NATs\
    \ are not recommended either -- as with many protocols, modifying\n   the brain-embedded\
    \ IP addresses is difficult, plus Avian Carriers MAY\n   eat the NATs.\n   Encapsulation\
    \ may be done with saran wrappers.  Unintentional\n   encapsulation in hawks has\
    \ been known to occur, with decapsulation\n   being messy and the packets mangled.\n\
    \   Loose source routes are a viable evolutionary alternative enhanced\n   standards-based\
    \ MSWindows-compliant technology, but strict source\n   routes MUST NOT be used,\
    \ as they are a choke-point.\n   The ITU has offered the IETF formal alignment\
    \ with its corresponding\n   technology, Penguins, but that won't fly.\n   Multicasting\
    \ is supported, but requires the implementation of a clone\n   device.  Carriers\
    \ may be lost if they are based on a tree as it is\n   being pruned.  The carriers\
    \ propagate via an inheritance tree.  The\n   carriers have an average TTL of\
    \ 15 years, so their use in expanding\n   ring searches is limited.\n   Additional\
    \ quality of service discussion can be found in a Michelin's\n   guide.\n"
