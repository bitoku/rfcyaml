  - "Abstract\n   This document describes several use cases of peering of non-VoIP\n\
    \   (Voice over IP) services between two or more Service Providers.\n   These\
    \ Service Providers create a peering relationship between\n   themselves, thus\
    \ enabling their users to collaborate with users on\n   the other Service Provider\
    \ network.  The target of this document is\n   to drive requirements for peering\
    \ between domains that provide the\n   non-VoIP based collaboration services with\
    \ presence and, in\n   particular, Instant Messaging (IM).\n   Table of Contents\n"
- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   This document uses the terminology as defined in [1] unless\
    \ otherwise\n   stated.\n   Real Time Collaboration (RTC) services have become\
    \ as prevalent and\n   essential for users on the Internet as email.  While RTC\
    \ services can\n   be implemented directly by users in a point-to-point fashion,\
    \ they\n   are often provided for, or on behalf of, a Peer Network of users\n\
    \   within an administrative domain.  As the use of these services grows,\n  \
    \ users increasingly have the need to communicate with users not only\n   within\
    \ their own Peer Network but with those in other Peer Networks\n   as well (similar\
    \ to the old Public Switched Telephony Network (PSTN)\n   that enabled global\
    \ reachability).  In practice, each Peer Network is\n   controlled by some domain,\
    \ and so there is a need to provide for\n   easier establishment of connectivity\
    \ between Peer Networks and for\n   the management of the relationships between\
    \ the Peer Networks.  This\n   document describes a set of use cases that describe\
    \ how peering\n   between Peer Networks may be used in non-VoIP RTC services.\
    \  The use\n   cases are intended to help in identifying and capturing requirements\n\
    \   that will guide and then enable a secure and easier peering between\n   Peer\
    \ Networks that provide non-VoIP RTC services.  The use cases for\n   the VoIP\
    \ RTC services are described in [2].\n   Note that this document does not define\
    \ requirements for a new\n   protocol or for protocol extensions.  It captures\
    \ the way that\n   presence and Instant Messaging are currently used within enterprises\n\
    \   and operator domains.\n"

    '
- title: 2.1.  Simple Interdomain Subscription
  contents:
  - "2.1.  Simple Interdomain Subscription\n   Assume two Peer Networks, Peer Network\
    \ A and Peer Network B.  User\n   Alice@example.com (hosted in Peer Network A)\
    \ wants to subscribe to\n   user Bob@example.net (hosted in Peer Network B) and\
    \ get his presence\n   information.  In order to do so, Alice@example.com could\
    \ connect\n   directly to example.net and subscribe to Bob's presence information.\n\
    \   However, Peer Network B is willing to accept subscriptions and route\n   IMs\
    \ only when they are coming from its users or from other Peer\n   Networks that\
    \ Peer Network B trusts.\n   In reality, what will happen is Peer Network A will\
    \ connect to Peer\n   Network B and send Alice's subscription to Bob via Peer\
    \ Network B.\n   When Peer Network B has new information on Bob, it will send\n\
    \   notifications to Peer Network A, which will pass them to Alice.\n"
- title: 2.2.  List-Based Interdomain Subscription
  contents:
  - "2.2.  List-Based Interdomain Subscription\n   This is similar to the simple interdomain\
    \ subscription use case,\n   except in this case Alice subscribes to a Uniform\
    \ Resource Identifier\n   (URI) [8] that represents a list of users in Peer Network\
    \ B [9] [3].\n   There are several types of lists that Alice may subscribe to:\n\
    \   o  Personal group - a list that is created and maintained by Alice\n     \
    \ and includes Alice's watch list.\n   o  Public group - a list that is created\
    \ and maintained by an\n      administrator.  Public groups usually contain a\
    \ list of specific\n      people that have some common characteristic, e.g., support\
    \ group\n      of a company.\n   o  Ad-hoc group - a list that is short lived\
    \ and is usually created\n      in the context of some activity that Alice is\
    \ doing.  An ad-hoc\n      group may be created by Alice or by some application.\
    \  Typical\n      examples may be the list of people that participate with Alice\
    \ in\n      a conference or a game.\n"
- title: 2.3.  Authorization Migration
  contents:
  - "2.3.  Authorization Migration\n      If many users from one Peer Network watch\
    \ presentities [6] in\n      another Peer Network, it may be possible that many\
    \ watchers [6]\n      from one Peer Network will subscribe to the same user in\
    \ the other\n      Peer Network.  However, due to privacy constraints that enable\
    \ a\n      user to provide different presence documents to different\n      watchers,\
    \ each Peer Network will have to send multiple copies of\n      the watched-presence\
    \ document.  The need to send multiple copies\n      between the Peer Networks\
    \ is very inefficient and causes redundant\n      traffic between the Peer Networks.\n\
    \      In order to make the subscription between Peer Networks more\n      efficient\
    \ there needs to be a way to enable Peer Networks to agree\n      to share privacy\
    \ information between them.  This will enable\n      sending a single copy (the\
    \ full copy) of the presence document of\n      the watched user and letting the\
    \ receiving Peer Network be\n      responsible for sending the right values to\
    \ the right watchers\n      according to the delegated privacy policies of the\
    \ watched users.\n      Instead of sharing the watched user's privacy policies\
    \ between the\n      Peer Networks, it is also possible to send different copies\
    \ of the\n      presence document with a list of the watchers the presence\n \
    \     document is intended for.  For example, if there is a set of\n      watchers\
    \ in one Peer Network that may see the location of the\n      presentity and another\
    \ set of users in the same Peer Network that\n      may not see the location information,\
    \ two presence documents will\n      be sent--each associated with a list of watchers\
    \ that should\n      receive it.  One presence document will contain the location\n\
    \      information and will be associated with a list of users that may\n    \
    \  see it, and the other presence document will not contain the\n      location\
    \ information and will be associated with a list of users\n      that may not\
    \ see the location information. See [11].\n"
- title: 2.4.  Pager Mode IM
  contents:
  - "2.4.  Pager Mode IM\n      In this use case, a user from one Peer Network sends\
    \ a pager mode\n      [7] IM to a user on another Peer Network.\n"
- title: 2.5.  Session Based IM
  contents:
  - "2.5.  Session Based IM\n      In this use case, a user from one Peer Network\
    \ creates a Message\n      Session Relay Protocol (MSRP) [10] session with a user\
    \ from\n      another Peer Network.\n"
- title: 2.6.  Other Services
  contents:
  - "2.6.  Other Services\n      In addition to VoIP sessions, which are out of scope\
    \ for this\n      document, only presence and IM have been ratified as RFCs. \
    \ In\n      addition to presence and IM, there are many other services that\n\
    \      are being standardized or that may be implemented using minimal\n     \
    \ extensions to existing standards.  These include:\n   o  N-way chat - enable\
    \ a multi-participant textual chat that will\n      include users from multiple\
    \ Peer Networks.  See [4] for more\n      details.\n   o  File transfer - send\
    \ files from a user in one Peer Network to a\n      user in another Peer Network.\
    \  See [5] for more details.\n   o  Document sharing - sharing and editing a document\
    \ between users in\n      different Peer Networks.\n      Note: Document sharing\
    \ is mentioned in this document only for\n      completeness of use cases.  It\
    \ is not being standardized by the\n      IETF and will not be included in the\
    \ requirements document that\n      will result from this document.\n   The list\
    \ above is of course not exhaustive, as new developments in\n   the world of non-VoIP\
    \ RTC will surface new services.  Enabling\n   peering between networks for some\
    \ of the services will create a basis\n   for enabling peering for future services\
    \ also.\n"
- title: 2.7.  Federation and Clearing House
  contents:
  - "2.7.  Federation and Clearing House\n   A federation as defined in [1] enables\
    \ peering between multiple Peer\n   Networks.  A federation may be implemented\
    \ by means of a central\n   service providing a hub for the Peer Networks or,\
    \ alternatively, Peer\n   Networks may connect to each other in a peer-to-peer\
    \ fashion.  One of\n   the most important services that this hub type of federation\
    \ should\n   provide is authorized interconnection that enables each Peering\n\
    \   Network to securely identify other Peering Networks.  Other services\n   that\
    \ might be provided include an N-way chat server, lawful\n   interception, logging,\
    \ and more.  This hub type of federation is also\n   known as a \"Clearing House\"\
    .\n   As non-VoIP services are usually text-based and consume less\n   bandwidth,\
    \ they may benefit from having a central service that will\n   do central services\
    \ such as logging for them.  For example, instead\n   of requiring each Peer Network\
    \ to log all messages that are being\n   sent to the other Peer-Network, this\
    \ service can be done by the\n   Clearing House.\n"
- title: 3.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "3.  Security Considerations\n   When Peer Network A peers with Peer Network B,\
    \ there are several\n   security issues for which the administrator of each Peer\
    \ Network will\n   need mechanisms to verify:\n   o  All communication channels\
    \ between Peer Networks and between each\n      Peer Network and the Clearing\
    \ House have their authenticity and\n      confidentiality protected.\n   o  The\
    \ other Peer Network is really the Peering Network that it\n      claims to be.\n\
    \   o  The other Peer Network is secure and trustworthy, such that\n      information\
    \ that is passed to it will not reach a third party.\n      This includes information\
    \ about specific users as well as\n      information about the authorization policies\
    \ associated with user\n      information.\n   o  The other Peer Network is secure\
    \ and trustworthy, such that it\n      will not modify or falsify data that it\
    \ presents to its users\n      except as required by the authorization policy\
    \ provided.\n   o  If there is a third party (e.g., a Clearing House) involved\
    \ in the\n      connection between the two Peering Networks that element is also\n\
    \      secure.\n   The same issues of security are even more important from the\
    \ point of\n   view of the users of the Peer Networks.  Users will be concerned\n\
    \   about how their privacy is being adhered to when their presence\n   information\
    \ is sent to the other Peer Network.  Users today are\n   concerned about providing\
    \ their email address to a third party when\n   they register to a domain; presence\
    \ contains much more sensitive\n   information, and the concern of users here\
    \ will be even greater.\n   The privacy issue is even harder when we take into\
    \ account that, in\n   order to enable scalable peering between big Peer Networks,\
    \ there are\n   some optimizations that may require migration of the privacy\n\
    \   definitions of users between Peer Network (see Section 2.3).  We can\n   imagine\
    \ the fiasco that would ensue if a user of one Peer Network\n   were able to see\
    \ the privacy information and learn he/she is listed\n   in the block list of\
    \ a close friend.\n   This document discusses use cases for peering between Peer\
    \ Networks.\n   It is out of the scope of this document to provide solutions for\n\
    \   security.  Nevertheless, it is obvious that the protocols that will\n   enable\
    \ the use cases described here will have to provide for the\n   security considerations\
    \ also described here.\n"
