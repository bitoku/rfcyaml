- title: Abstract
  contents:
  - "Abstract\n   This memo provides an update and clarification to RFC 1811.  This\n\
    \   document describes the registration policies for the top-level domain\n  \
    \ \".GOV\".  Thus far, Federal Agencies and their subsidiaries have\n   registered\
    \ without any guidance.  This has resulted in multiple\n   registrations for Federal\
    \ Agencies and naming schemes that do not\n   facilitate responsiveness to the\
    \ public.  This document fixes this by\n   restricting registrations to coincide\
    \ with the approved structure of\n   the US government.  The document cited, FIPS\
    \ 95-1, provides a\n   standard recognized structure into which domain registrations\
    \ for\n   .GOV can be fit.  This policy is exactly comparable to that for the\n\
    \   top-level domains.  The IANA requires that an organization/country\n   apply\
    \ for and get a 2 letter code from ISO/ITU (e.g., US for United\n   States) for\
    \ additional top-level registration.\n   As a side effect, this reduces the number\
    \ of .GOV level registrations\n   and reduces the workload on the Internic.\n"
- title: U.S. GOVERNMENT INTERNET DOMAIN NAMES POLICY
  contents:
  - "U.S. GOVERNMENT INTERNET DOMAIN NAMES POLICY\n   The .GOV domain is delegated\
    \ from the root authority to the US\n   Federal Networking Council.  The .GOV\
    \ domain is for registration of\n   US governmental entities on the federal level\
    \ only.  Registrations\n   for state and local governmental agencies shall be\
    \ made under the .US\n   domain in accordance with the policies for that domain.\n\
    \   1) The document \"Codes for the Identification of Federal and\n   Federally\
    \ Assisted Organizations\", FIPS 95-1 (or its successor)\n   lists the official\
    \ names of US Government agencies.\n     A) Top-level entities (e.g., those with\
    \ codes ending in 00 such as\n     \"1200 Department of Agriculture\"), and independent\
    \ agencies and\n     organizations (e.g., \"National Science Foundation and other\
    \ non-\n     indented listings unless prohibited below) as listed in this\n  \
    \   document are eligible for registration directly under .GOV.\n     B) Autonomous\
    \ law enforcement components of top-level entities\n     (e.g., \"Federal Bureau\
    \ of Investigation\", \"Secret Service\", \"Coast\n     Guard\") are also eligible\
    \ for registration.\n     C) Cross-agency collaborative organizations (e.g., \"\
    Federal\n     Networking Council\", \"Information Infrastructure Task Force\"\
    ) are\n     eligible for registration under .GOV upon presentation of the\n  \
    \   chartering document and are the only non-FIPS-listed\n     organizations eligible\
    \ for registration under .GOV.\n     D) Subsidiary, non-autonomous components\
    \ of top-level or other\n     entities are not eligible for separate registration.\n\
    \     International organizations listed in this document are NOT\n     eligible\
    \ for registration under .GOV.\n     E) Organizations listed as \"Federally Aided\
    \ Organizations\" are not\n     eligible for registration under .GOV and should\
    \ register under\n     .ORG or other appropriate top-level domain.\n     F) Organizations\
    \ subsidiary to \"Department of Defense\" must\n     register under the \".MIL\"\
    \ domain via the Defense Data Network\n     Network Information Center - contact\
    \ registrar@nic.ddn.mil.\n   The only standard exceptions to these rules are changes\
    \ to\n   governmental structure due to statutory, regulatory or executive\n  \
    \ directives not yet reflected in the above document.  The requesting\n   agency\
    \ should provide documentation in one of the above forms to\n   request an exception.\
    \  Other requests for exception should be\n   referred to the Federal Networking\
    \ Council.\n   2) A domain name should be derived from the official name for the\n\
    \   organization (e.g., \"USDA.Gov\" or \"Agriculture.GOV\".)  The\n   registration\
    \ shall be listed in the registration database under the\n   official name (per\
    \ FIPS 95-1) for the organization or under the name\n   in the chartering document.\n\
    \   3) Only ONE registration and delegation shall be made per agency.\n   The\
    \ .GOV registration authority shall provide registrations on a\n   first-come\
    \ first-served basis.  It is an individual agency matter as\n   to which portion\
    \ of the agency is responsible for managing the domain\n   space under a delegated\
    \ agency domain.\n   4) Those agencies and entities that have multiple registrations\
    \ under\n   .GOV may retain them for a maximum of 3 years from the publication\n\
    \   date of this document.  Within 6 months after the publication of this\n  \
    \ document, one permanent domain must be selected for the agency.  The\n   other\
    \ (auxiliary) domains must cease further sub-delegations and\n   registrations\
    \ at this time.  As of 1 year after the publication of\n   this document, the\
    \ auxiliary domains will become undelegated and will\n   revert to the control\
    \ of the .GOV owner. As of 2 years after the\n   publication of this document,\
    \ all registrations in the auxiliary\n   domains must be mirrored in the permanent\
    \ domain and those names should\n   be used where possible. At the 3 year point,\
    \ all auxiliary domain\n   registrations will be deleted.\n   5) Those agencies\
    \ and entities already registered in .GOV but not\n   listed in FIPS 95-1 (e.g.,\
    \ DOE labs, state entities) may retain their\n   registration within the constraint\
    \ of the single registration rule\n   (see para 4).  No further non-FIPS-listed\
    \ registrations will be made.\n   State and local entities are strongly encouraged\
    \ to re-register under\n   .US, but this is not mandatory.\n"

    \ for each of the Department of Transportation and the\n   FAA would not (The\
    \ FAA is an autonomous component contained within\n   the DOT).\n   * The policy\
    \ requires resolution of all duplicate registrations\n   within the next three\
    \ years.\n   * Local and state agencies registered under the \".GOV\" domain may\n\
    \   remain there.  However, they are strongly encouraged to transfer to\n   the\
    \ US domain.\n   * Cross-agency collaborative efforts may register under \".ORG\"\
    \ or\n   \".US\" as an alternative to asking for an exception to the policy.\n"

    '
- title: EXISTING .GOV REGISTRATIONS
  contents:
  - "EXISTING .GOV REGISTRATIONS\n   Q.  What are examples of FIPS-95-1 Departments\
    \ possessing duplicate\n   top level domain names, and what guidance has been\
    \ given to them\n   regarding these names?\n   A.  Examples of FIPS-95-1 Departments\
    \ with duplicate DNS' include\n   \"STATE.GOV\" and \"LABOR.GOV\".  These departments\
    \ have six months to\n   determine which name is permanent and which is auxiliary\
    \ and three\n   years to drop the auxiliary registration.\n   Q.  Currently, our\
    \ services are defined as www.cdc.gov, ftp.cdc.gov,\n   and gopher.cdc.gov.  Does\
    \ this proposal mean that our names will now\n   be: www.ntb.ops.cdc.phs.dhhs.gov,\
    \ etc or at a minimum:\n   www.cdc.phs.dhhs.gov, ftp.cdc.phs.dhhs.gov, and\n \
    \  gopher.cdc.phs.dhhs.gov?\n   A.  In the case of CDC, NIST, NIH, FDA, and the\
    \ numerous other non-\n   FIPS-95-1 agencies registered with \".GOV\" domains,\
    \ there will be no\n   changes.  The existing DNSs of these agencies are grandfathered\
    \ under\n   this policy.  In addition, the policy effects only the domains\n \
    \  allowed to be registered directly under .GOV; further delegations are\n   under\
    \ the control of the subdomain owner.  For the above, assuming\n   the HHS subdomain\
    \ owner concurs, there is no problem with the HHS\n   registering \"cdc.dhhs.gov\"\
    \ as a subdomain of \"dhhs.gov\".\n   Q.  How will registrations by Federal Laboratories\
    \ be addressed?\n   A.  The existing domain names will be grandfathered, i.e.,\
    \ LBL.GOV.\n   Any new registrations will generally be within the domain of the\n\
    \   sponsoring agency (and subject to that agencies policies), within the\n  \
    \ .US domain as a geographic entity, or within the .ORG domain.\n   Q.  What are\
    \ some examples of state government agencies registered\n   under \".GOV\" domain?\
    \  Will they need to change their DNS?\n   A.  Examples of cities and states that\
    \ originally registered under\n   the \".GOV\" include:\n        WA.GOV Department\
    \ of Information Services, State of Washington\n        LA.GOV Bureau of Sanitation,\
    \ City of Los Angeles\n   These entities are strongly encouraged to reregister\
    \ in the \".US\"\n   domain but this is NOT mandatory.  No further state and local\n\
    \   agencies will be registered under .GOV.\n   Q.  It is not in anyone's best\
    \ interest to name things by\n   organizational boundaries as these things change.\
    \ Internet domain\n   names and host names, once defined and used, become so widely\n\
    \   distributed that they become virtually impossible to change.\n   Organizational\
    \ structure changes but not the underlying networking\n   structure.\n   A.  The\
    \ policy does not require organizations to change their names\n   once established,\
    \ but individual agency policies may.  The DNS system\n   contains some capabilities\
    \ to assist in name transition - the CNAME\n   record provides a capability for\
    \ cross-domain aliases which can be\n   used to ease a transition between one\
    \ name space and another.  As\n   noted in the clarifications, naming and subdomain\
    \ conventions WITHIN\n   an agency or department DNS delegation are solely the\
    \ province of\n   that entity.\n   Q.  How can two entities have the same name\
    \ registered?  How does\n   this apply to NIH.GOV, FDA.GOV, and CDC.GOV, all of\
    \ which are large\n   components of DHHS/PHS?  NCIFCRF.GOV is a component of NIH.\
    \  Does it\n   have to change?  I don't understand how a distinction is made if\
    \ some\n   are grandfathered and some are not.\n   A. US-STATE.GOV and STATE.GOV\
    \ for example.  The problem is actually\n   one entity with two names.  NIH.GOV\
    \ and FDA.GOV represent separate\n   entities (albeit within DHHS).  If there\
    \ were an NIH.GOV and an NIH-\n   EAST.GOV for example, NIH would have to eliminate\
    \ one of them\n   (probably moving NIH-EAST.GOV to EAST.NIH.GOV).\n   Q.  How\
    \ much is the taxpayer being asked to spend to alter tens of\n   thousands of\
    \ existing computer and telecommunications systems to\n   support RFC 1816?\n\
    \   A.  There are currently less that half-a-dozen duplicate DNS names at\n  \
    \ the FIPS-95-1 level which will need to be changed.  Given the fact\n   that\
    \ this will be accomplished over the next three years, the costs\n   should be\
    \ minimal.\n"

  - "CROSS-AGENCY COLLABORATIONS\n   Q.  An organization maintains a domain name which\
    \ represents a\n   cross-agency community, IC.GOV, which represents members of\
    \ the\n   intelligence community.  As a cross-agency collaborative effort, does\n\
    \   the domain have to be reregistered?\n   A.  The policy states that \"Cross-agency\
    \ collaborative organizations\n   (e.g., \"Federal Networking Council\", \"Information\
    \ Infrastructure Task\n   Force\") are eligible for registration under .GOV upon\
    \ presentation of\n   the chartering document and are the only non-FIPS-listed\n\
    \   organizations eligible for registration under .GOV.\"  \"IC.GOV\"\n   however,\
    \ is grandfathered since it is an existing domain.\n   Nevertheless, it would\
    \ be appropriate to provide a copy of the\n   chartering document to the FNC for\
    \ the record.  This would ease\n   future changes to the IC.GOV domain if necessary.\n"

  - "FUTURE .GOV REGISTRATIONS\n   Q.  Top level domains are roughly equivalent to\
    \ the cabinet-level\n   agencies identified in FIPS-95-1.  What will happen if\
    \ non-FIPS-95-1\n   entities apply for the \".GOV\" registration in the future?\n\
    \   A.  The Internic will use RFC 1816 as guidance and will not grant the\n  \
    \ \".GOV\" to any new entity which is not listed in the FIPS-95-1 or\n   which\
    \ has not been granted an exception status by the FNC Executive\n   Committee.\n\
    \   Q.  Suppose NIH were moved to a new Dept. of Science?  Would our\n   domain\
    \ name have to be changed?\n   A.  NIH.GOV is grandfathered under the existing\
    \ policy and would not\n   change.  The \"Department of Science\" under its own\
    \ policies may\n   require you to re-register though.\n"
- title: FNC INTENT
  contents:
  - "FNC INTENT\n   Q.  It is unclear how this will policy will facilitate access\
    \ by the\n   public to our information, especially since most of the public\n\
    \   doesn't know our organizational structure or that CDC is part of\n   DHHS/PHS.\n\
    \   A. The policy attempts to avoid confusion as an increasing number of\n   entities\
    \ register under the \".GOV\" domain and to transfer authority\n   and responsibility\
    \ for domain name space to the appropriate agencies\n   and away from a centralized\
    \ authority.  For facilitating access,\n   various tools and capabilities are\
    \ coming into use on the Internet\n   all the time.  Most of these tools provide\
    \ a fairly strong search\n   capability which should obviate most concerns of\
    \ finding resources\n   based on domain names.\n   Q.  Section 1D of RFC 1816\
    \ unfairly constrains the organizations\n   within the .gov domain in stark contrast\
    \ to Section 1F which grants\n   .mil domain organizations full freedom to operate\
    \ subdomains in any\n   manner chosen.\n   A.  The Federal Networking Council\
    \ has jurisdiction over the \".GOV\"\n   domain names; \".MIL\" domain names fall\
    \ within the jurisdiction of the\n   Department of Defense.  The .MIL domain has\
    \ had a written policy\n   delimiting which DOD agencies get registered directly\
    \ under .MIL\n   since about 1987 when the DNS first started to come into use.\n\
    \   Individual agencies under the .MIL domain (e.g., AF.MIL/US Air Force)\n  \
    \ are responsible for setting policy within their domains and for\n   registrations\
    \ within those domains.  This is exactly equivalent to\n   the .GOV domain - an\
    \ individual agency (e.g., Treasury.GOV/Dept of\n   Treasury) may and should set\
    \ policy for subregistrations within their\n   domain.\n   Q.  Section 1B identifies\
    \ several law enforcement agencies as being\n   \"autonomous\" for the purposes\
    \ of domain registration.  What is the\n   selection criteria for an \"autonomous\
    \ law enforcement\" agency?  For\n   instance, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS)\
    \ is responsible for law\n   enforcement as is the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco,\
    \ and Firearms (ATF).\n   A.  The selection criteria for \"law enforcement agency\"\
    \ is based on\n   primary mission.  A case could be made for either or both of\
    \ these\n   being law enforcement agencies, although the IRS' primary mission\
    \ is\n   tax revenue collection and has few armed officers relative to its\n \
    \  size.  An \"autonomous\" agency is one with mission and role distinct\n   and\
    \ (possibly) separate from its containing department.\n   Unfortunately, 95-1\
    \ does not do a good job of identifying\n   \"autonomous\" entities.  In the event\
    \ of problems with registration,\n   ask the registrar to get a ruling from the\
    \ FNC.\n"
- title: ROUTING QUESTIONS
  contents:
  - "ROUTING QUESTIONS\n   Q.  How will Domain Name Service resolution on the Net\
    \ work?  Instead\n   of a root DNS server returning the address of cdc.gov and\
    \ immediately\n   directing inquires to our DNS servers, will the root server\
    \ return a\n   DNS pointer to DHHS, then DHHS will resolve to PHS, then a fourth\
    \ DNS\n   query to get to CDC?  This will add unnecessary traffic to the Net.\n\
    \   (example is host.CDC.PHS.DHHS.GOV)\n   A.  The answer is based on how you\
    \ (personally and agency wide)\n   configure your servers.  First, most servers\
    \ cache previous answers -\n   they may have to ask once, but generally remember\
    \ the answer if they\n   need it again. Information directly under .GOV will be\
    \ fairly long-\n   lived which substantially reduces the requirement to query\
    \ .GOV\n   server.  Secondly, multiple levels of the DNS tree MAY reside on the\n\
    \   same server.  In the above example the information for DHHS.GOV,\n   PHS.DHHS.GOV\
    \ and CDC.PHS.DHHS.GOV could all reside on the same\n   server.  Assuming the\
    \ location of the DHHS.GOV server was not cached,\n   it would require 2 queries.\
    \  Further queries would cache the location\n   of this server and the servers\
    \ associated with the domains it serves.\n   Lastly, the individual agencies may\
    \ structure their domains as they\n   please.  CDC could reside directly under\
    \ DHHS.GOV as CDC.DHHS.GOV\n   subject to HHS's own policies.\n"
