  title: Abstract
- contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   This document specifies a method of adding traffic engineering\n
    \  capabilities to OSPF Version 2 [1].  The architecture of traffic\n   engineering
    is described in [5].  The semantic content of the\n   extensions is essentially
    identical to the corresponding extensions\n   to IS-IS [6].  It is expected that
    the traffic engineering extensions\n   to OSPF will continue to mirror those in
    IS-IS.\n   The extensions provide a way of describing the traffic engineering\n
    \  topology (including bandwidth and administrative constraints) and\n   distributing
    this information within a given OSPF area.  This\n   topology does not necessarily
    match the regular routed topology,\n   though this proposal depends on Network
    LSAs to describe multi-access\n   links.  This document purposely does not say
    how the mechanisms\n   described here can be used for traffic engineering across
    multiple\n   OSPF areas; that task is left to future documents.  Furthermore,
    no\n   changes have been made to the operation of OSPFv2 flooding; in\n   particular,
    if non-TE capable nodes exist in the topology, they MUST\n   flood TE LSAs as
    any other type 10 (area-local scope) Opaque LSAs\n   (see [3]).\n"
  - contents:
    - "1.1.  Applicability\n   Many of the extensions specified in this document are
      in response to\n   the requirements stated in [5], and thus are referred to
      as \"traffic\n   engineering extensions\", and are also commonly associated
      with MPLS\n   Traffic Engineering.  A more accurate (albeit bland) designation
      is\n   \"extended link attributes\", as the proposal is to simply add more\n
      \  attributes to links in OSPF advertisements.\n   The information made available
      by these extensions can be used to\n   build an extended link state database
      just as router LSAs are used to\n   build a \"regular\" link state database;
      the difference is that the\n   extended link state database (referred to below
      as the traffic\n   engineering database) has additional link attributes.  Uses
      of the\n   traffic engineering database include:\n      o  monitoring the extended
      link attributes;\n      o  local constraint-based source routing; and\n      o
      \ global traffic engineering.\n   For example, an OSPF-speaking device can participate
      in an OSPF area,\n   build a traffic engineering database, and thereby report
      on the\n   reservation state of links in that area.\n   In \"local constraint-based
      source routing\", a router R can compute a\n   path from a source node A to
      a destination node B; typically, A is R\n   itself, and B is specified by a
      \"router address\" (see below).  This\n   path may be subject to various constraints
      on the attributes of the\n   links and nodes that the path traverses, e.g.,
      use green links that\n   have unreserved bandwidth of at least 10Mbps.  This
      path could then\n   be used to carry some subset of the traffic from A to B,
      forming a\n   simple but effective means of traffic engineering.  How the subset
      of\n   traffic is determined, and how the path is instantiated, is beyond\n
      \  the scope of this document; suffice it to say that one means of\n   defining
      the subset of traffic is \"those packets whose IP\n   destinations were learned
      from B\", and one means of instantiating\n   paths is using MPLS tunnels.  As
      an aside, note that constraint-based\n   routing can be NP-hard, or even unsolvable,
      depending on the nature\n   of the attributes and constraints, and thus many
      implementations will\n   use heuristics.  Consequently, we don't attempt to
      sketch an\n   algorithm here.\n   Finally, for \"global traffic engineering\",
      a device can build a\n   traffic engineering database, input a traffic matrix
      and an\n   optimization function, crunch on the information, and thus compute\n
      \  optimal or near-optimal routing for the entire network.  The device\n   can
      subsequently monitor the traffic engineering topology and react\n   to changes
      by recomputing the optimal routes.\n"

    - "1.2.  Limitations\n   As mentioned above, this document specifies extensions
      and procedures\n   for intra-area distribution of Traffic Engineering information.\n
      \  Methods for inter-area and inter-AS (Autonomous System) distribution\n   are
      not discussed here.\n   The extensions specified in this document capture the
      reservation\n   state of point-to-point links.  The reservation state of multi-access\n
      \  links may not be accurately reflected, except in the special case in\n   which
      there are only two devices in the multi-access subnetwork.\n   Operation over
      multi-access networks with more than two devices is\n   not specifically prohibited.
      \ A more accurate description of the\n   reservation state of multi-access networks
      is for further study.\n   This document also does not support unnumbered links.

      types of Opaque LSAs exist, each of which has a different\n   flooding scope.
      \ This proposal uses only Type 10 LSAs, which have an\n   area flooding scope.\n
      \  One new LSA is defined, the Traffic Engineering LSA.  This LSA\n   describes
      routers, point-to-point links, and connections to multi-\n   access networks
      (similar to a Router LSA).  For traffic engineering\n   purposes, the existing
      Network LSA is sufficient for describing\n   multi-access links, so no additional

        IP address of the\n   advertising router that is always reachable if there
        is any\n   connectivity to it; this is typically implemented as a \"loopback\n
        \  address\".  The key attribute is that the address does not become\n   unusable
        if an interface is down.  In other protocols, this is known\n   as the \"router
        ID,\" but for obvious reasons this nomenclature is\n   avoided here.  If a

        LSAs, and suppose further that some router S is\n   building a single Traffic
        Engineering Database (TED) based on both\n   IS-IS and OSPF TE information.
        \ R may then appear as two separate\n   nodes in S's TED.  However, if both
        the IS-IS and OSPF LSAs generated\n   by R contain the same Router Address,
        then S can determine that the\n   IS-IS TE LSA and the OSPF TE LSA from R
        are indeed from a single\n   router.\n   The router address TLV is type 1,
        has a length of 4, and a value that\n   is the four octet IP address.  It

  - "3.  Elements of Procedure\n   Routers shall originate Traffic Engineering LSAs
    whenever the LSA\n   contents change, and whenever otherwise required by OSPF
    (an LSA\n   refresh, for example).  Note that this does not mean that every\n
    \  change must be flooded immediately; an implementation MAY set\n   thresholds
    (for example, a bandwidth change threshold) that trigger\n   immediate flooding,
    and initiate flooding of other changes after a\n   short time interval.  In any
    case, the origination of Traffic\n   Engineering LSAs SHOULD be rate-limited to
    at most one every\n   MinLSInterval [1].\n   Upon receipt of a changed Traffic
    Engineering LSA or Network LSA\n   (since these are used in traffic engineering
    calculations), the\n   router should update its traffic engineering database.
    \ No Shortest\n   Path First (SPF) or other route calculations are necessary.\n"

  - "4.  Compatibility Issues\n   There should be no interoperability issues with
    routers that do not\n   implement these extensions, as the Opaque LSAs will be
    silently\n   ignored.\n   The result of having routers that do not implement these
    extensions\n   is that the traffic engineering topology will be missing pieces.\n
    \  However, if the topology is connected, TE paths can still be\n   calculated
    and ought to work.\n"

  - "5.  Security Considerations\n   This document specifies the contents of Opaque
    LSAs in OSPFv2.  As\n   Opaque LSAs are not used for SPF computation or normal
    routing, the\n   extensions specified here have no affect on IP routing.  However,\n
    \  tampering with TE LSAs may have an effect on traffic engineering\n   computations,
    and it is suggested that any mechanisms used for\n   securing the transmission
    of normal OSPF LSAs be applied equally to\n   all Opaque LSAs, including the TE
    LSAs specified here.\n   Note that the mechanisms in [1] and [9] apply to Opaque
    LSAs.  It is\n   suggested that any future mechanisms proposed to secure/authenticate\n
    \  OSPFv2 LSA exchanges be made general enough to be used with Opaque\n   LSAs.\n"

  - "6.  IANA Considerations\n   The top level Types in a TE LSA, as well as Types
    for sub-TLVs for\n   each top level Type, have been registered with IANA, except
    as noted.\n   Here are the guidelines (using terms defined in [10]) for the\n
    \  assignment of top level Types in TE LSAs:\n   o  Types in the range 3-32767
    are to be assigned via Standards\n      Action.\n   o  Types in the range 32768-32777
    are for experimental use; these\n      will not be registered with IANA, and MUST
    NOT be mentioned by\n      RFCs.\n   o  Types in the range 32778-65535 are not
    to be assigned at this\n      time.  Before any assignments can be made in this
    range, there\n      MUST be a Standards Track RFC that specifies IANA Considerations\n
    \     that covers the range being assigned.\n   The guidelines for the assignment
    of types for sub-TLVs in a TE LSA\n   are as follows:\n   o  Types in the range
    10-32767 are to be assigned via Standards\n      Action.\n   o  Types in the range
    32768-32777 are for experimental use; these\n      will not be registered with
    IANA, and MUST NOT be mentioned by\n      RFCs.\n   o  Types in the range 32778-65535
    are not to be assigned at this\n      time.  Before any assignments can be made
    in this range, there\n      MUST be a Standards Track RFC that specifies IANA
    Considerations\n      that covers the range being assigned.\n"
