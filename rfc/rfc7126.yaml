  - "1.  Introduction\n   This document discusses the filtering of IPv4 packets based\
    \ on the\n   IPv4 options they contain.  Since various protocols may use IPv4\n\
    \   options to some extent, dropping packets based on the options they\n   contain\
    \ may have implications on the proper functioning of such\n   protocols.  Therefore,\
    \ this document attempts to discuss the\n   operational and interoperability implications\
    \ of such dropping.\n   Additionally, it outlines what a network operator might\
    \ do in typical\n   enterprise or Service Provider environments.  This document\
    \ also\n   draws and is partly derived from [RFC6274], which also received\n \
    \  review from the operational community.\n   We note that data seems to indicate\
    \ that there is a current\n   widespread practice of blocking IPv4 optioned packets.\
    \  There are\n   various plausible approaches to minimize the potential negative\n\
    \   effects of IPv4 optioned packets while allowing some option\n   semantics.\
    \  One approach is to allow for specific options that are\n   expected or needed,\
    \ and have a default deny.  A different approach is\n   to deny unneeded options\
    \ and have a default allow.  Yet a third\n   possible approach is to allow for\
    \ end-to-end semantics by ignoring\n   options and treating packets as un-optioned\
    \ while in transit.\n   Experiments and currently available data tend to support\
    \ the first or\n   third approaches as more realistic.  Some results regarding\
    \ the\n   current state of affairs with respect to dropping packets containing\n\
    \   IP options can be found in [MEDINA] and [FONSECA].  Additionally,\n   [BREMIER-BARR]\
    \ points out that the deployed Internet already has many\n   routers that do not\
    \ process IP options.\n   We also note that while this document provides advice\
    \ on dropping\n   packets on a \"per IP option type\", not all devices (routers,\
    \ security\n   gateways, and firewalls) may provide this capability with such\n\
    \   granularity.  Additionally, even in cases in which such functionality\n  \
    \ is provided, an operator might want to specify a dropping policy with\n   a\
    \ coarser granularity (rather than on a \"per IP option type\"\n   granularity),\
    \ as indicated above.\n   Finally, in scenarios in which processing of IP options\
    \ by\n   intermediate systems is not required, a widespread approach is to\n \
    \  simply ignore IP options and process the corresponding packets as if\n   they\
    \ do not contain any IP options.\n"

- title: 2.  IP Options
  contents:
  - "2.  IP Options\n   IP options allow for the extension of the Internet Protocol.\
    \  As\n   specified in [RFC0791], there are two cases for the format of an\n \
    \  option:\n   o  Case 1: A single byte of option-type.\n   o  Case 2: An option-type\
    \ byte, an option-length byte, and the actual\n      option-data bytes.\n   IP\
    \ options of Case 1 have the following syntax:\n   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+- - - - -\
    \ - - - -\n   |  option-type  |  option-data\n   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+- - - - - -\
    \ - - -\n   The length of IP options of Case 1 is implicitly specified by the\n\
    \   option-type byte.\n   IP options of Case 2 have the following syntax:\n  \
    \ +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+- - - - - - - - -\n   |  option-type  | option-length\
    \ |  option-data\n   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+- - - - - - - - -\n   In\
    \ this case, the option-length byte counts the option-type byte and\n   the option-length\
    \ byte, as well as the actual option-data bytes.\n   All current and future options,\
    \ except \"End of Option List\" (Type =\n   0) and \"No Operation\" (Type = 1),\
    \ are of Class 2.\n   The option-type has three fields:\n   o  1 bit: copied flag.\n\
    \   o  2 bits: option class.\n   o  5 bits: option number.\n   The copied flag\
    \ indicates whether this option should be copied to all\n   fragments in the event\
    \ the packet carrying it needs to be fragmented:\n   o  0 = not copied.\n   o\
    \  1 = copied.\n   The values for the option class are:\n   o  0 = control.\n\
    \   o  1 = reserved for future use.\n   o  2 = debugging and measurement.\n  \
    \ o  3 = reserved for future use.\n   This format allows for the creation of new\
    \ options for the extension\n   of the Internet Protocol (IP).\n   Finally, the\
    \ option number identifies the syntax of the rest of the\n   option.\n   The \"\
    IP OPTION NUMBERS\" registry [IANA-IP] contains the list of the\n   currently\
    \ assigned IP option numbers.\n"

- title: 3.1.  Processing Requirements
  contents:
  - "3.1.  Processing Requirements\n   Historically, most IP routers used a general-purpose\
    \ CPU to process\n   IP packets and forward them towards their destinations. \
    \ This same\n   CPU usually also processed network management traffic (e.g., SNMP),\n\
    \   configuration commands (e.g., command line interface), and various\n   routing\
    \ protocols (e.g., RIP, OSPF, BGP, IS-IS) or other control\n   protocols (e.g.,\
    \ RSVP, ICMP).  In such architectures, it has been\n   common for the general-purpose\
    \ CPU also to perform any packet\n   filtering that has been enabled on the router\
    \ (or router interface).\n   An IP router built using this architecture often\
    \ has a significant\n   Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attack risk if the\
    \ router\n   control plane (e.g., CPU) is overwhelmed by a large number of IPv4\n\
    \   packets that contain IPv4 options.\n   From about 1995 onwards, a growing\
    \ number of IP routers have\n   incorporated silicon specialized for IP packet\
    \ processing (i.e.,\n   Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA), Application-Specific\
    \ Integrated\n   Circuit (ASIC)), thereby separating the function of IP packet\n\
    \   forwarding from the other functions of the router.  Such router\n   architectures\
    \ tend to be more resilient to DDoS attacks that might be\n   seen in the global\
    \ public Internet.  Depending upon various\n   implementation and configuration\
    \ details, routers with a silicon\n   packet-forwarding engine can handle high\
    \ volumes of IP packets\n   containing IP options without any adverse impact on\
    \ packet-forwarding\n   rates or on the router's control plane (e.g., general-purpose\
    \ CPU).\n   Some implementations have a configuration knob simply to forward all\n\
    \   IP packets containing IP options at wire-speed in silicon, as if the\n   IP\
    \ packet did not contain any IP options (\"ignore options &\n   forward\").  Other\
    \ implementations support wire-speed silicon-based\n   packet filtering, thereby\
    \ enabling packets containing certain IP\n   options to be selectively dropped\
    \ (\"drop\"), packets containing\n   certain other IP options to have those IP\
    \ options ignored (\"ignore\n   options & forward\"), and other packets containing\
    \ different IP\n   options to have those options processed, either on a general-purpose\n\
    \   CPU or using custom logic (e.g., FPGA, ASIC), while the packet is\n   being\
    \ forwarded (\"process option & forward\").\n   Broadly speaking, any IP packet\
    \ that requires processing by an IP\n   router's general-purpose CPU can be a\
    \ DDoS risk to that router's\n   general-purpose CPU (and thus to the router itself).\
    \  However, at\n   present, the particular architectural and engineering details\
    \ of the\n   specific IP router being considered are important to understand when\n\
    \   evaluating the operational security risks associated with a\n   particular\
    \ IP packet type or IP option type.\n   Operators are urged to consider the capabilities\
    \ of potential IP\n   routers for IP option filtering and handling as they make\
    \ deployment\n   decisions in the future.\n   Additional considerations for protecting\
    \ the control plane from\n   packets containing IP options can be found in [RFC6192].\n\
    \   Finally, in addition to advice to operators, this document also\n   provides\
    \ advice to router, security gateway, and firewall\n   implementers in terms of\
    \ providing the capability to filter packets\n   with different granularities:\
    \ both on a \"per IP option type\"\n   granularity (to maximize flexibility) as\
    \ well as more coarse filters\n   (to minimize configuration complexity).\n"

    \   Among other things, the option can be used to:\n   o  Bypass firewall rules.\n\
    \   o  Reach otherwise unreachable internet systems.\n   o  Establish TCP connections\
    \ in a stealthy way.\n   o  Learn about the topology of a network.\n   o  Perform\
    \ bandwidth-exhaustion attacks.\n   Of these attack vectors, the one that has\
    \ probably received least\n   attention is the use of the LSRR option to perform\
    \ bandwidth\n   exhaustion attacks.  The LSRR option can be used as an amplification\n\
    \   method for performing bandwidth-exhaustion attacks, as an attacker\n   could\
    \ make a packet bounce multiple times between a number of systems\n   by carefully\
    \ crafting an LSRR option.\n      This is the IPv4 version of the IPv6 amplification\
    \ attack that was\n      widely publicized in 2007 [Biondi2007].  The only difference\
    \ is\n      that the maximum length of the IPv4 header (and hence the LSRR\n \
    \     option) limits the amplification factor when compared to the IPv6\n    \
    \  counterpart.\n   Additionally, some implementations have been found to fail\
    \ to include\n   proper sanity checks on the LSRR option, thus leading to security\n\
    \   issues.  These specific issues are believed to be solved in all\n   modern\

    \      arising from improper validation of the Pointer field of the LSRR\n   \
    \   option.\n   Finally, we note that some systems were known for providing a\
    \ system-\n   wide toggle to enable support for this option for those scenarios\
    \ in\n   which this option is required.  However, improper implementation of\n\
    \   such a system-wide toggle caused those systems to support the LSRR\n   option\
    \ even when explicitly configured not to do so.\n      [OpenBSD1998] is a security\
    \ advisory about an improper\n      implementation of such a system-wide toggle\

  contents:
  - "4.13.2.  Option Specification\n   The DoD Extended Security Option (ESO) is specified\
    \ by RFC 1108\n   [RFC1108].\n      Some private IP networks consider IP router-based\
    \ per-interface\n      selective filtering of packets based on (a) the presence\
    \ of an\n      IPSO option (including BSO and ESO) and (b) based on the contents\n\
    \      of that IPSO option to be important for operational security\n      reasons.\
    \  The recent IPv6 CALIPSO option specification discusses\n      this in additional\
    \ detail, albeit in an IPv6 context [RFC5570].\n      Such private IP networks\
    \ commonly are built using both commercial\n      and open-source products --\
    \ for hosts, guards, firewalls,\n      switches, routers, etc.  Some commercial\
    \ IP routers support this\n      option, as do some IP routers that are built\
    \ on top of MLS\n      operating systems (e.g., on top of Trusted Solaris [Solaris2008]\n\
    \      or Security-Enhanced Linux [SELinux2008]).\n      For example, many Cisco\
    \ routers that run Cisco IOS include support\n      for selectively filtering\
    \ packets that contain the IP Security\n      Options (IPSO) with per-interface\
    \ granularity.  This capability\n      has been present in many Cisco routers\
    \ since the early 1990s\n      [Cisco-IPSO-Cmds].  Some government sector products\
    \ reportedly\n      also support the IP Security Options (IPSO), for example,\
    \ CANEWARE\n      [RFC4949].\n      Support for the IPSO Extended Security Option\
    \ also is included in\n      the \"IPsec Configuration Policy Information Model\"\
    \ [RFC3585] and\n      in the \"IPsec Security Policy Database Configuration MIB\"\
    \n      [RFC4807].  Section 4.6.1 of the IP Security Domain of\n      Interpretation\
    \ [RFC2407] includes support for labeled IPsec\n      security associations compatible\
    \ with the IP Security Options.\n"

- title: 4.23.4.  Advice
  contents:
  - "4.23.4.  Advice\n   Routers, security gateways, and firewalls SHOULD have configuration\n\
    \   knobs for IP packets containing these options (or other options not\n   recognized)\
    \ to select between \"ignore & forward\" and \"drop & log\".\n   Section 4.23.1\
    \ points out that [RFC1122] and [RFC1812] specify that\n   unrecognized IP options\
    \ MUST be ignored.  However, the previous\n   paragraph states that routers, security\
    \ gateways, and firewalls\n   SHOULD have a configuration option for dropping\
    \ and logging IP\n   packets containing unrecognized options.  While it is acknowledged\n\
    \   that this advice contradicts the previous RFCs' requirements, the\n   advice\
    \ in this document reflects current operational reality.\n   Special care needs\
    \ to be taken in the case of \"drop & log\".  Devices\n   SHOULD count the number\
    \ of packets dropped, but the logging of drop\n   events SHOULD be limited so\
    \ as to not overburden device resources.\n"
- title: 5.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "5.  Security Considerations\n   This document provides advice on the filtering\
    \ of IP packets that\n   contain IP options.  Dropping such packets can help to\
    \ mitigate the\n   security issues that arise from use of different IP options.\
    \  Many of\n   the IPv4 options listed in this document are deprecated and cause\
    \ no\n   operational impact if dropped.  However, dropping packets containing\n\
    \   IPv4 options that are in use can cause real operational problems in\n   deployed\
    \ networks.  Therefore, the practice of dropping all IPv4\n   packets containing\
    \ one or more IPv4 options without careful\n   consideration is not recommended.\n"
