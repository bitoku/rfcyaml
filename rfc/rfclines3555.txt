Abstract This document defines the procedure to register RTP Payload Formats as audio, video or other MIME subtype names.
This is useful in a text based format or control protocol to identify the type of an RTP transmission.
This document also registers all the RTP payload formats defined in the RTP Profile for Audio and Video Conferences as MIME subtypes.
Some of these may also be used for transfer modes other than RTP.
The MIME registration procedure described in RFC 2048 [1] was originally designed for transport of multimedia information via asynchronous Internet mail, but the MIME namespace now provides identification for other transport modes as well.
This document defines the procedure to register MIME subtype names for use with the Real time Transport Protocol (RTP), RFC 3550 [2], to identify RTP payload formats.
This document also registers all the RTP payload formats defined in the RTP Profile for Audio and Video Conferences, RFC 3551 [3], as MIME subtypes under the "audio" and "video" MIME types.
This document registers the following MIME subtypes:
audio/DVI4 audio/G722 audio/G723 audio/G726 16
audio/G726 24 audio/G726 32 audio/
G726 40 audio/G728 audio/G729 audio/G729D audio/G729E audio/GSM audio/GSM EFR audio/L8 audio/L16 audio/LPC audio/MPA audio/PCMA audio/PCMU audio/QCELP audio/RED audio/VDVI video/
BT656 video/CelB video/JPEG video/H261 video/H263 video/H263 1998
video/MPV video/MP2T video/MP1S video/MP2P video/BMPEG video/nv MIME subtype audio/L16 has already been registered via RFC 2586 for transports other than RTP.
That registration is incorporated here and augmented with additional information for RTP transport.
The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [4] and indicate requirement levels for implementations compliant with this specification.
Procedure For Registering MIME Types for RTP Payload Types
Registering an RTP payload type as a MIME type follows the same procedures as described in RFC 2048 and uses the registration template shown in Section 2.8 of RFC 2048.
Some additional parameters are required to specify how a particular payload format is transported over RTP:
A description of the encoding and a specification of the payload format must be provided, usually by reference to an RTP payload format specification RFC.
That RFC may be separate, or the MIME subtype registration may be incorporated into the payload format specification RFC.
The payload format specification MUST include the RTP timestamp clock rate (or multiple rates for audio encodings with multiple sampling rates).
A reference to a further description of the data compression format itself should be provided, if available.
If the payload format does not have a fixed RTP timestamp clock rate, then a "rate" parameter is required to specify the RTP timestamp clock rate.
A particular payload format may have additional required parameters.
Optional parameters Most audio payload formats can have an optional "channels" parameter to specify the number of audio channels included in the transmission.
Any payload format, but most likely audio formats, may also include the optional parameters "ptime", to specify the recommended length of time in milliseconds represented by the media in a packet, and/or "maxptime" to specify the maximum amount of media which can be encapsulated in each packet, expressed as time in milliseconds.
The "ptime" and "maxptime" parameters are defined in the Session Description Protocol (SDP) [5].
A particular payload format may have additional optional parameters.
The fact that the type can be transferred via RTP MUST be noted.
Depending on whether the type has already been registered for transfer with a non RTP protocol (e.g. MIME mail or http) or not, several different cases can occur: a) Not yet registered as a MIME type
A new registration should be constructed using the MIME registration template.
The registration may specify transfer via other means in addition to RTP if that is feasible and desired.
The encoding considerations must specify how the type is transferred via RTP.
Optional parameters may be defined as needed, and it must be clearly stated whether to which mode(s) of transfer the parameters apply.
b) MIME type exists for a non RTP protocol
The encoding considerations of the existing type should be changed to indicate that the type can also be transferred via RTP.
RTP specific parameters may be added, and it must be clearly stated that these are only to be used when the media type is transmitted via RTP transport.
c) Update an existing MIME type for RTP to be used for a non RTP protocol
The encoding considerations of the existing type should be changed to indicate that the type can also be transferred via a non RTP protocol (e.g. SMTP, HTTP).
Non RTP specific parameters can be added, and it must be clearly stated that these are only to be used when the media type is transmitted via a non RTP transport.
" parameter) Parameters may be required for a particular type or subtype or they may be optional.
For media types which represent RTP payload formats, the parameters "rate", "channels", "ptime", and "maxptime" have general definitions (given above) that may apply across types and subtypes.
The value may need to be a quoted string if it contains any of the special characters listed in RFC 2045.
The information carried in the media type string has a specific mapping to fields in the Session Description Protocol (SDP) [5], which is commonly used to describe RTP sessions.
The mapping is as follows:
The MIME type (e.g., audio) goes in SDP
"m " as the media name.
The MIME subtype (payload format) goes in SDP "a rtpmap" as the encoding name.
The general (possibly optional) parameters "rate" and "channels" also go in "a rtpmap" as clock rate and encoding parameters, respectively.
The general (and optional) parameters "ptime" and "maxptime" go in the SDP "a ptime" and "a maxptime" attributes, respectively.
Any payload format specific parameters go in the SDP "a fmtp" attribute.
The set of allowed parameters is defined by the RFC that specifies the payload format and MUST NOT be extended by the MIME subtype registration without a corresponding revision of the payload format specification.
The format and syntax of these parameters may also be defined by the payload format specification, but it is suggested that the parameters be copied directly from the MIME media type string as a semicolon separated list of parameter value pairs.
For payload formats that specify some other syntax for the fmtp parameters, the registration of that payload format as a MIME subtype must specify what the parameters are in MIME format and how to map them to the SDP "a fmtp" attribute.
See Section 4.1.21 for an example.
An example mapping is as follows:
; channels 2; ptime 5; emphasis 50 15 m audio 49170
a fmtp:97 emphasis 50 15
a ptime:5 Note that the payload format (encoding) names defined in the RTP Profile are commonly shown in upper case.
MIME subtypes are commonly shown in lower case.
These names are case insensitive in both places.
Similarly, parameter names are case insensitive both in MIME types and in the default mapping to the SDP a fmtp attribute.
In the following sections, all RTP payload formats described in the RTP Profile for Audio and Video Conferences, RFC 3551 [3], are registered as MIME subtypes.
The following sections register all of the RTP audio payload types defined in RFC 3551 as MIME types.
For most audio payload formats, the RTP timestamp clock rate is equal to the sampling rate.
Some payload formats operate only at one fixed sampling rate, while others are adjustable.

Registration of MIME media type audio/L16 MIME subtype audio/L16 has already been registered via RFC 2586 for transports other than RTP.
That registration is incorporated here and augmented with additional information for RTP transport.
L16 Required parameters rate: number of samples per second
For non RTP transport, the permissible values for rate are 8000, 11025, 16000, 22050, 24000, 32000, 44100, and 48000 samples per second.
For RTP transport, other values are permissible but the aforementioned values are RECOMMENDED.
For RTP, the rate parameter indicates the RTP timestamp clock rate, which is equal to the sample rate.
Optional parameters channels: how many audio streams are interleaved   defaults to 1; stereo would be 2, etc.
Interleaving takes place between individual two byte samples.
analog preemphasis applied to the signal before quantization.
The only emphasis value defined here is emphasis 50 15 to indicate the 50/15 microsecond preemphasis used with Compact Disks.
This parameter MUST be omitted if no analog preemphasis was applied.
channel order: specifies the sample interleaving order for multiple channel audio streams (see [7] Section 7).
Permissible values are DV.LRLsRs, DV.LRCS, DV.LRCWo, DV.LRLsRsC, DV.LRLsRsCS, DV.LmixRmixTWoQ1Q2, DV.LRCWoLsRsLmixRmix, DV.LRCWoLs1Rs1Ls2Rs2, DV.LRCWoLsRsLcRc.
For interoperation with DV video systems, only a subset of these channel combinations is specified for use with 20 bit linear encoding in the DV video specification [4]; those are DV.LRLsRs, DV.LRCS, DV.LmixRmixTWoQ1Q2.
This parameter MUST be omitted when the AIFF C channel order convention (see RFC 3551) is in use.
For RTP, ptime: RECOMMENDED duration of each packet in milliseconds.
For RTP, maxptime: maximum duration of each packet in milliseconds.
Encoding considerations Audio data is binary data, and must be encoded for non binary transport; the Base64 encoding is suitable for Email.
Note that audio data does not compress easily using lossless compression.
This type is also defined for transfer via RTP [RFC 3550].
Security considerations Audio data is believed to offer no security risks.
See Section 5 of RFC 3555.
Interoperability considerations This type is compatible with the encoding used in the WAV (Microsoft Windows RIFF) and Apple AIFF union types, and with the public domain "sox" and "rateconv" programs.
Published specification RFC 2586 for non RTP transports, RFC 3551 for RTP Applications which use this media

Registration of MIME media type audio/MPA MIME media type name:
audio MIME subtype name: MPA (MPEG audio)
None Optional parameters: layer: which layer of MPEG audio encoding; permissible values are 1, 2, 3.
samplerate: the rate at which audio is sampled.
MPEG 1 audio supports sampling rates of 32, 44.1, and 48 kHz; MPEG 2 supports sampling rates of 16, 22.05 and 24 kHz.
This parameter is separate from the RTP timestamp clock rate which is always 90000 Hz for MPA.
permissible values are "stereo", "joint stereo", "single channel", "dual channel".
The "channels" parameter does not apply to MPA.
It is undefined to put a number of channels in the SDP rtpmap attribute for MPA. bitrate:
the data rate for the audio bit stream.
RECOMMENDED duration of each packet in milliseconds.
maxptime: maximum duration of each packet in milliseconds.
Parameters which are omitted are left to the encoder to choose based on the session bandwidth, configuration information, or other constraints.
The selected layer as well as the sampling rate and mode are indicated in the payload
so receivers can process the data without these parameters being specified externally.

Registration of MIME media type audio/RED MIME media type name: audio MIME subtype name:
pt: a comma separated list of RTP payload types.
Because comma is a special character, the list must be a quoted string (enclosed in double quotes).
For static payload types, each list element is simply the type number.
For dynamic payload types, each list element is a mapping of the dynamic payload type number to an embedded MIME content type specification for the payload format corresponding to the dynamic payload type.
If the content  type string does not include a comma, it MAY still be quoted.
Since it is part of the list which must itself be a quoted  string, that means the quotation marks MUST be quoted with backslash quoting as specified in RFC 2045.
If the content  type string itself contains a quoted string, then the requirement for backslash quoting is recursively applied.
To specify the audio/RED payload format in SDP, the pt parameter is mapped to an a fmtp attribute by eliminating the parameter name (pt) and changing the commas to slashes.
For example, 'pt "0,5"' maps to 'a fmtp:99 0/5'.
A more complicated example, with a dynamic payload type, is:
" m audio 49170 RTP/AVP 99 0 103 a rtpmap:99 RED/8000 a fmtp:99 0/103

The MIME subtype registration procedure specified in this memo does not impose any security considerations on its own.
This memo also contains several MIME type registrations.
The registrations themselves do not impose security risks, but some may state security considerations specific to the particular registration.
Several audio and video encodings are perfect for hiding data using steganography.
The RTP specification, RFC 3550, provides security considerations for the transport of audio and video data over RTP, including the use of encryption where confidentiality is required.
