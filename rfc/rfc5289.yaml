  - "Abstract\n   RFC 4492 describes elliptic curve cipher suites for Transport Layer\n
    \  Security (TLS).  However, all those cipher suites use HMAC-SHA-1 as\n   their
    Message Authentication Code (MAC) algorithm.  This document\n   describes sixteen
    new cipher suites for TLS that specify stronger MAC\n   algorithms.  Eight use
    Hashed Message Authentication Code (HMAC) with\n   SHA-256 or SHA-384, and eight
    use AES in Galois Counter Mode (GCM).\n"

  - "1.  Introduction\n   RFC 4492 [RFC4492] describes Elliptic Curve Cryptography
    (ECC) cipher\n   suites for Transport Layer Security (TLS).  However, all of the
    RFC\n   4492 suites use HMAC-SHA1 as their MAC algorithm.  Due to recent\n   analytic
    work on SHA-1 [Wang05], the IETF is gradually moving away\n   from SHA-1 and towards
    stronger hash algorithms.  This document\n   specifies TLS ECC cipher suites that
    use SHA-256 and SHA-384 [SHS]\n   rather than SHA-1.\n   TLS 1.2 [RFC5246], adds
    support for authenticated encryption with\n   additional data (AEAD) cipher modes
    [RFC5116].  This document also\n   specifies a set of ECC cipher suites using
    one such mode, Galois\n   Counter Mode (GCM) [GCM].  Another document [RFC5288]
    provides\n   support for GCM with other key establishment methods.\n"
