- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   The Lightweight Directory Access Protocol [RFC4510] (LDAP)\
    \ is an\n   extensible protocol.  LDAP supports:\n      -  the addition of new\
    \ operations,\n      -  the extension of existing operations, and\n      -  the\
    \ extensible schema.\n   This document details procedures for registering values\
    \ used to\n   unambiguously identify extensible elements of the protocol, including\n\
    \   the following:\n      - LDAP message types\n      - LDAP extended operations\
    \ and controls\n      - LDAP result codes\n      - LDAP authentication methods\n\
    \      - LDAP attribute description options\n      - Object Identifier descriptors\n\
    \   These registries are maintained by the Internet Assigned Numbers\n   Authority\
    \ (IANA).\n   In addition, this document provides guidelines to IANA describing\
    \ the\n   conditions under which new values can be assigned.\n   This document\
    \ replaces RFC 3383.\n"

- title: 3.  IANA Considerations for LDAP
  contents:
  - "3.  IANA Considerations for LDAP\n   This section details each kind of protocol\
    \ value that can be\n   registered and provides IANA guidelines on how to assign\
    \ new values.\n   IANA may reject obviously bogus registrations.\n   LDAP values\
    \ specified in RFCs MUST be registered.  Other LDAP values,\n   except those in\
    \ private-use name spaces, SHOULD be registered.  RFCs\n   SHOULD NOT reference,\
    \ use, or otherwise recognize unregistered LDAP\n   values.\n"
- title: 3.1.  Object Identifiers
  contents:
  - "3.1.  Object Identifiers\n   Numerous LDAP schema and protocol elements are identified\
    \ by Object\n   Identifiers (OIDs) [X.680].  Specifications that assign OIDs to\n\
    \   elements SHOULD state who delegated the OIDs for their use.\n   For IETF-developed\
    \ elements, specifications SHOULD use OIDs under\n   \"Internet Directory Numbers\"\
    \ (1.3.6.1.1.x).  For elements developed\n   by others, any properly delegated\
    \ OID can be used, including those\n   under \"Internet Directory Numbers\" (1.3.6.1.1.x)\
    \ or \"Internet Private\n   Enterprise Numbers\" (1.3.6.1.4.1.x).\n   Internet\
    \ Directory Numbers (1.3.6.1.1.x) will be assigned upon Expert\n   Review with\
    \ Specification Required.  Only one OID per specification\n   will be assigned.\
    \  The specification MAY then assign any number of\n   OIDs within this arc without\
    \ further coordination with IANA.\n   Internet Private Enterprise Numbers (1.3.6.1.4.1.x)\
    \ are assigned by\n   IANA <http://www.iana.org/cgi-bin/enterprise.pl>.  Practices\
    \ for IANA\n   assignment of Internet Private Enterprise Numbers are detailed\
    \ in RFC\n   2578 [RFC2578].\n   To avoid interoperability problems between early\
    \ implementations of a\n   \"work in progress\" and implementations of the published\
    \ specification\n   (e.g., the RFC), experimental OIDs SHOULD be used in \"works\
    \ in\n   progress\" and early implementations.  OIDs under the Internet\n   Experimental\
    \ OID arc (1.3.6.1.3.x) may be used for this purpose.\n   Practices for IANA assignment\
    \ of these Internet Experimental numbers\n   are detailed in RFC 2578 [RFC2578].\n"
- title: 3.2.  Protocol Mechanisms
  contents:
  - "3.2.  Protocol Mechanisms\n   LDAP provides a number of Root DSA-Specific Entry\
    \ (DSE) attributes\n   for discovery of protocol mechanisms identified by OIDs,\
    \ including\n   the supportedControl, supportedExtension, and supportedFeatures\n\
    \   attributes [RFC4512].\n   A registry of OIDs used for discovery of protocol\
    \ mechanisms is\n   provided to allow implementors and others to locate the technical\n\
    \   specification for these protocol mechanisms.  Future specifications\n   of\
    \ additional Root DSE attributes holding values identifying protocol\n   mechanisms\
    \ MAY extend this registry for their values.\n   Protocol mechanisms are registered\
    \ on a First Come First Served\n   basis.\n"
- title: 3.3.  LDAP Syntaxes
  contents:
  - "3.3.  LDAP Syntaxes\n   This registry provides a listing of LDAP syntaxes [RFC4512].\
    \  Each\n   LDAP syntax is identified by an OID.  This registry is provided to\n\
    \   allow implementors and others to locate the technical specification\n   describing\
    \ a particular LDAP Syntax.\n   LDAP Syntaxes are registered on a First Come First\
    \ Served with\n   Specification Required basis.\n   Note: Unlike object classes,\
    \ attribute types, and various other kinds\n         of schema elements, descriptors\
    \ are not used in LDAP to\n         identify LDAP Syntaxes.\n"
- title: 3.4.  Object Identifier Descriptors
  contents:
  - "3.4.  Object Identifier Descriptors\n   LDAP allows short descriptive names (or\
    \ descriptors) to be used\n   instead of a numeric Object Identifier to identify\
    \ select protocol\n   extensions [RFC4511], schema elements [RFC4512], LDAP URL\
    \ [RFC4516]\n   extensions, and other objects.\n   Although the protocol allows\
    \ the same descriptor to refer to\n   different object identifiers in certain\
    \ cases and the registry\n   supports multiple registrations of the same descriptor\
    \ (each\n   indicating a different kind of schema element and different object\n\
    \   identifier), multiple registrations of the same descriptor are to be\n   avoided.\
    \  All such multiple registration requests require Expert\n   Review.\n   Descriptors\
    \ are restricted to strings of UTF-8 [RFC3629] encoded\n   Unicode characters\
    \ restricted by the following ABNF:\n      name = keystring\n   Descriptors are\
    \ case insensitive.\n   Multiple names may be assigned to a given OID.  For purposes\
    \ of\n   registration, an OID is to be represented in numeric OID form (e.g.,\n\
    \   1.1.0.23.40) conforming to the following ABNF:\n      numericoid = number\
    \ 1*( DOT number )\n   While the protocol places no maximum length restriction\
    \ upon\n   descriptors, they should be short.  Descriptors longer than 48\n  \
    \ characters may be viewed as too long to register.\n   A value ending with a\
    \ hyphen (\"-\") reserves all descriptors that\n   start with that value.  For\
    \ example, the registration of the option\n   \"descrFamily-\" reserves all options\
    \ that start with \"descrFamily-\"\n   for some related purpose.\n   Descriptors\
    \ beginning with \"x-\" are for Private Use and cannot be\n   registered.\n  \
    \ Descriptors beginning with \"e-\" are reserved for experiments and will\n  \
    \ be registered on a First Come First Served basis.\n   All other descriptors\
    \ require Expert Review to be registered.\n   The registrant need not \"own\"\
    \ the OID being named.\n   The OID name space is managed by the ISO/IEC Joint\
    \ Technical\n   Committee 1 - Subcommittee 6.\n"
- title: 3.5.  AttributeDescription Options
  contents:
  - "3.5.  AttributeDescription Options\n   An AttributeDescription [RFC4512] can\
    \ contain zero or more options\n   specifying additional semantics.  An option\
    \ SHALL be restricted to a\n   string of UTF-8 encoded Unicode characters limited\
    \ by the following\n   ABNF:\n      option = keystring\n   Options are case insensitive.\n\
    \   While the protocol places no maximum length restriction upon option\n   strings,\
    \ they should be short.  Options longer than 24 characters may\n   be viewed as\
    \ too long to register.\n   Values ending with a hyphen (\"-\") reserve all option\
    \ names that start\n   with the name.  For example, the registration of the option\n\
    \   \"optionFamily-\" reserves all options that start with \"optionFamily-\"\n\
    \   for some related purpose.\n   Options beginning with \"x-\" are for Private\
    \ Use and cannot be\n   registered.\n   Options beginning with \"e-\" are reserved\
    \ for experiments and will be\n   registered on a First Come First Served basis.\n\
    \   All other options require Standards Action or Expert Review with\n   Specification\
    \ Required to be registered.\n"
- title: 3.6.  LDAP Message Types
  contents:
  - "3.6.  LDAP Message Types\n   Each protocol message is encapsulated in an LDAPMessage\
    \ envelope\n   [RFC4511.  The protocolOp CHOICE indicates the type of message\n\
    \   encapsulated.  Each message type consists of an ASN.1 identifier in\n   the\
    \ form of a keyword and a non-negative choice number.  The choice\n   number is\
    \ combined with the class (APPLICATION) and data type\n   (CONSTRUCTED or PRIMITIVE)\
    \ to construct the BER tag in the message's\n   encoding.  The choice numbers\
    \ for existing protocol messages are\n   implicit in the protocol's ASN.1 defined\
    \ in [RFC4511].\n   New values will be registered upon Standards Action.\n   Note:\
    \ LDAP provides extensible messages that reduce but do not\n         eliminate\
    \ the need to add new message types.\n"
- title: 3.7.  LDAP Authentication Method
  contents:
  - "3.7.  LDAP Authentication Method\n   The LDAP Bind operation supports multiple\
