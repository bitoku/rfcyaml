  - "                            Daytime Protocol\nThis RFC specifies a standard for\
    \ the ARPA Internet community.  Hosts on\nthe ARPA Internet that choose to implement\
    \ a Daytime Protocol are\nexpected to adopt and implement this standard.\nA useful\
    \ debugging and measurement tool is a daytime service.  A daytime\nservice simply\
    \ sends a the current date and time as a character string\nwithout regard to the\
    \ input.\nTCP Based Daytime Service\n   One daytime service is defined as a connection\
    \ based application on\n   TCP.  A server listens for TCP connections on TCP port\
    \ 13.  Once a\n   connection is established the current date and time is sent\
    \ out the\n   connection as a ascii character string (and any data received is\n\
    \   thrown away).  The service closes the connection after sending the\n   quote.\n\
    UDP Based Daytime Service\n   Another daytime service service is defined as a\
    \ datagram based\n   application on UDP.  A server listens for UDP datagrams on\
    \ UDP port\n   13.  When a datagram is received, an answering datagram is sent\n\
    \   containing the current date and time as a ASCII character string (the\n  \
    \ data in the received datagram is ignored).\nDaytime Syntax\n   There is no specific\
    \ syntax for the daytime.  It is recommended that\n   it be limited to the ASCII\
    \ printing characters, space, carriage\n   return, and line feed.  The daytime\
    \ should be just one line.\n      One popular syntax is:\n         Weekday, Month\
    \ Day, Year Time-Zone\n         Example:\n            Tuesday, February 22, 1982\
    \ 17:37:43-PST\nRFC 867                                                      \

    \         \n      Another popular syntax is that used in SMTP:\n         dd mmm\
    \ yy hh:mm:ss zzz\n         Example:\n            02 FEB 82 07:59:01 PST\nNOTE:\
    \  For machine useful time use the Time Protocol (RFC-868).\n"
