- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   This memo requests that the IANA create a registry for fields\
    \ in the\n   IGMP protocol header.\n   The terms \"Specification Required\", \"\
    Expert Review\", \"IESG Approval\",\n   \"IETF Consensus\", and \"Standards Action\"\
    , are used in this memo to\n   refer to the processes described in [2].\n"
- title: 2.  IANA Considerations for fields in the IPv4 IGMP header
  contents:
  - "2.  IANA Considerations for fields in the IPv4 IGMP header\n   The IPv4 IGMP\
    \ header [1] contains the following fields that carry\n   values assigned from\
    \ IANA-managed name spaces: Type and Code.  Code\n   field values are defined\
    \ relative to a specific Type value.\n   Values for the IPv4 IGMP Type fields\
    \ are allocated using an IESG\n   Approval or Standards Action processes.  Code\
    \ Values for existing\n   IPv4 IGMP Type fields are allocated using IESG Approval\
    \ or Standards\n   Action processes.  The policy for assigning Code values for\
    \ new IPv4\n   IGMP Types should be defined in the document defining the new Type\n\
    \   value.\n"
- title: 3.  Assignments for testing and experimentation
  contents:
  - "3.  Assignments for testing and experimentation\n   Instead of suggesting temporary\
    \ assignments as in [3], this document\n   follows the lead of [4] and assigns\
    \ a range of values for\n   experimental use.  The IGMP Code values 240-255 inclusive\
    \ (0xf0 -\n   0xff) are reserved for protocol testing and experimentation.\n \
    \  Systems should silently ignore IGMP messages with unknown Code\n   values.\n"
- title: 4.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "4.  Security Considerations\n   Security analyzers such as firewalls and network\
    \ intrusion detection\n   monitors often rely on unambiguous interpretations of\
    \ the fields\n   described in this memo.  As new values for the fields are assigned,\n\
    \   existing security analyzers that do not understand the new values may\n  \
    \ fail, resulting in either loss of connectivity if the analyzer\n   declines\
    \ to forward the unrecognized traffic, or loss of security if\n   it does forward\
    \ the traffic and the new values are used as part of an\n   attack.  This vulnerability\
    \ argues for high visibility (which the\n   Standards Action and IETF Consensus\
    \ processes ensure) for the\n   assignments whenever possible.\n"
