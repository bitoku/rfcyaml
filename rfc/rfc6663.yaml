  - "Abstract\n   Pre-Congestion Notification (PCN) is a means for protecting quality\n\
    \   of service for inelastic traffic admitted to a Diffserv domain.  The\n   overall\
    \ PCN architecture is described in RFC 5559.  This memo\n   describes the requirements\

    \ of sent PCN-\n   traffic between that PCN-ingress-node and PCN-egress-node.\
    \  The\n   Decision Point may be either collocated with the PCN-ingress-node or\n\
    \   a centralized node (in the first case, (2) is not required).  The\n   signaling\

  - "1.  Introduction\n   The main objective of Pre-Congestion Notification (PCN)\
    \ is to support\n   the quality of service (QoS) of inelastic flows within a Diffserv\n\
    \   domain in a simple, scalable, and robust fashion.  Two mechanisms are\n  \
    \ used: admission control and flow termination.  Admission control is\n   used\
    \ to decide whether to admit or block a new flow request, while\n   flow termination\
    \ is used in abnormal circumstances to decide whether\n   to terminate some of\
    \ the existing flows.  To support these two\n   features, the overall rate of\
    \ PCN-traffic is metered on every link in\n   the domain, and PCN-packets are\
    \ appropriately marked when certain\n   configured rates are exceeded.  These\
    \ configured rates are below the\n   rate of the link, thus providing notification\
    \ to boundary nodes about\n   overloads before any congestion occurs (hence \"\
    pre-congestion\"\n   notification).  The PCN-egress-nodes measure the rates of\
    \ differently\n   marked PCN traffic in periodic intervals and report these rates\
    \ to\n   the Decision Points for admission control and flow termination; the\n\
    \   Decision Points use these rates to make decisions.  The Decision\n   Points\
    \ may be collocated with the PCN-ingress-nodes, or their\n   function may be implemented\
    \ in a centralized node.  For more details\n   see [RFC5559], [RFC6661], and [RFC6662].\n\
    \   This memo specifies the requirements on signaling protocols:\n   o  to carry\
    \ reports from a PCN-egress-node to the Decision Point,\n   o  to carry requests,\
    \ from the Decision Point to a PCN-ingress-node,\n      that trigger the PCN-ingress-node\
    \ to measure the PCN-sent-rate,\n   o  to carry reports, from a PCN-ingress-node\
    \ to the Decision Point.\n   The latter two messages are only needed if the Decision\
    \ Point and\n   PCN-ingress-node are not collocated.\n"

    \ Point(s)\n   The PCN-egress-node measures per ingress-egress-aggregate the rates\n\
    \   of differently marked PCN-traffic in regular intervals.  The\n   measurement\
    \ intervals are recommended to take a fixed value between\n   100 ms and 500 ms;\
    \ see [RFC6661] and [RFC6662].  At the end of each\n   measurement interval, the\
    \ PCN-egress-node calculates the congestion-\n   level-estimate (CLE) based on\
    \ these quantities.\n   The PCN-egress-node MAY be configured to record a set\
    \ of identifiers\n   of PCN-flows for which it received excess-traffic-marked\
    \ packets\n   during the last measurement interval.  The latter may be useful\
    \ to\n   perform flow termination in networks with multipath routing.\n   At the\
    \ end of each measurement interval, or less frequently if\n   \"optional report\
    \ suppression\" is activated (see [RFC6661] and\n   [RFC6662]), the PCN-egress-node\
    \ sends a report to the Decision Point.\n   For the SM edge behavior, the report\
    \ MUST contain:\n   o  the identifier of the PCN-ingress-node and the identifier\
    \ of the\n      PCN-egress-node (typically their IP addresses); together they\n\
    \      specify the ingress-egress-aggregate to which the report refers,\n   o\
    \  the rate of not-marked PCN-traffic (NM-rate) in octets/second, and\n   o  the\
    \ rate of PCN-marked traffic (PM-rate) in octets/second.\n   For the CL edge behavior,\
    \ the report MUST contain:\n   o  the identifier of the PCN-ingress-node and the\
    \ identifier of the\n      PCN-egress-node (typically their IP addresses); together\
    \ they\n      specify the ingress-egress-aggregate to which the report refers,\n\
    \   o  the rate of not-marked PCN-traffic (NM-rate) in octets/second,\n   o  the\
    \ rate of threshold-marked PCN traffic (ThM-rate) in\n      octets/second, and\n\
    \   o  the rate of excess-traffic-marked traffic (ETM-rate) in\n      octets/second.\n\
    \   The number format and the rate units used by the signaling protocol\n   will\
    \ limit the maximum rate that PCN can use.  If signaling space is\n   tight, it\
    \ might be reasonable to impose a limit, but any such limit\n   may impose unnecessary\
    \ constraints in the future.\n   The signaling report can either be sent directly\
    \ to the Decision\n   Point or it can \"piggy-back\", i.e., be included within\
    \ some other\n   message that passes through the PCN-egress-node and then reaches\
    \ the\n   Decision Point.\n   As described in [RFC6661], PCN reports from the\
    \ PCN-egress-node to\n   the Decision Point may contain flow identifiers for individual\
    \ flows\n   within an ingress-egress-aggregate that have recently experienced\n\
    \   excess-marking.  Hence, the PCN report messages used by the PCN CL\n   edge\
    \ behavior MUST be capable of carrying sequences of octet strings\n   constituting\
    \ such identifiers.\n   Signaling messages SHOULD have a higher priority and a\
    \ lower drop\n   precedence than PCN-packets (see [RFC5559]) in order to deliver\
    \ them\n   quickly and to prevent them from being dropped in case of overload.\n\
    \   The load generated by the signaling protocol SHOULD be minimized.  We\n  \
    \ give three methods that may help to achieve that goal:\n   1.  piggy-backing\
    \ the reports by the PCN-egress-nodes to the Decision\n      Point(s) onto other\
    \ signaling messages that are already in place,\n   2.  reducing the amount of\
    \ reports to be sent by optional report\n      suppression, or\n   3.  combining\
    \ reports for different ingress-egress-aggregates in a\n      single message (if\
    \ they are for the same Decision Point).\n   As PCN reports are sent regularly,\
    \ additional reliability mechanisms\n   are not needed.  This also holds in the\
    \ presence of optional report\n   suppression, as reports are sent periodically\
    \ if actions by the\n   Decision Point(s) are needed; see [RFC6661] and [RFC6662].\n"

    \   Through request-response signaling between the Decision Point and\n   PCN-ingress-node,\
    \ the Decision Point requests and in response the\n   PCN-ingress-node measures\

    \ Signaling is needed only if the\n   Decision Point and PCN-ingress-node are\
    \ not collocated.\n   The request MUST contain:\n   o  the identifier of the PCN-ingress-node\
    \ and the identifier of the\n      PCN-egress-node; together they determine the\
    \ ingress-egress-\n      aggregate for which the PCN-sent-rate is requested, and\n\

    \ and the report\n   MUST be addressed to the Decision Point that requested it.\n\
    \   Because they are sent only when flow termination is needed (which is\n   an\
    \ urgent action), the request and the report SHOULD be sent with\n   high priority,\
    \ with a lower drop precedence than PCN-packets, and in\n   a reliable manner.\n\
    \   Note that a complete system description for a PCN-domain with\n   centralized\
    \ Decision Point includes the signaling from Decision Point\n   to the PCN-ingress-nodes\
    \ to control flow admission and termination.\n   However, this is a known problem\
    \ (with solutions provided in\n   [RFC3084] and [RFC5431], for example), and it\
    \ lies outside the scope\n   of the present document.\n"
- title: 4.  Security Considerations

  - "4.  Security Considerations\n   [RFC5559] provides a general description of the\
    \ security\n   considerations for PCN.  This memo relies on the security-related\n\
    \   requirements of the PCN signaling, provided in [RFC5559].  In\n   particular,\
    \ the signaling between the PCN-boundary-nodes must be\n   protected from attacks.\
    \  For example, the recipient needs to validate\n   that the message is indeed\
    \ from the node that claims to have sent it.\n   Possible measures include digest\
    \ authentication and protection\n   against replay and man-in-the-middle attacks.\n\
    \   Specifically for the generic aggregate RSVP protocol, additional\n   protection\
    \ methods against security attacks are described in\n   [RFC4860].\n"
