  - "1.  Introduction\n   This document extends the Internet Message Access Protocol
    (IMAP)\n   [IMAP4rev1] with a new capability called \"SAVEDATE\".  This capability\n
    \  adds a new IMAP message attribute called \"save date\".  The save date\n   is
    the date and time at which a message was saved in the mailbox in\n   which it
    currently resides.  The save date is similar to the existing\n   \"internal date\"
    attribute in that it is set at the time of delivery.\n   However, the internal
    date attribute can be set to an arbitrary value\n   for messages delivered to
    the mailbox using the APPEND command and is\n   usually copied from the source
    message for messages delivered using\n   the COPY command.  In contrast, the save
    date attribute is always set\n   to the current date and time at the moment the
    message is saved in\n   the mailbox, irrespective of how the message is delivered
    and from\n   where it originates.\n   The save date attribute is useful for implementing
    automated removal\n   of messages from a mailbox after a configured amount of
    time.  For\n   that application, it is necessary to know when the message was
    saved\n   in the mailbox, which cannot be reliably determined using the\n   internal
    date attribute.\n   For example, a common client usage pattern is to move deleted\n
    \  messages to a Trash mailbox.  These messages are considered \"deleted\"\n   at
    the time they are moved to the Trash mailbox.  In an effort to\n   limit the size
    of the Trash mailbox, a client may subsequently desire\n   to permanently remove
    (expunge) all messages in that Trash mailbox\n   deleted before a certain time
    (e.g., a configurable expiration\n   interval).  In that case, the internal date
    attribute cannot be used\n   since it likely refers to the time at which the message
    was\n   originally received.  The proper time comparison attribute should\n   instead
    be the time at which the message was saved to the Trash\n   mailbox.  Similar
    usage patterns can be observed for archiving\n   solutions.\n   The SAVEDATE capability
    extends the FETCH command and response to\n   allow retrieving the date and time
    at which a message was saved.\n   Also, the SAVEDATE capability extends the SEARCH
    command to allow\n   searching messages with criteria based on when they were
    saved in the\n   mailbox.\n"

    sent by a client that is connected\n   to a server.  \"S:\" indicates lines sent
    by the server to the client.\n   The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\",
    \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"NOT
    RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and\n   \"OPTIONAL\" in this document are to be interpreted
    as described in\n   BCP 14 [KEYWORDS] [KEYWORDS-UPD] when, and only when, they
    appear in\n   all capitals, as shown here.\n"

  - "3.  Save Date Message Attribute\n   The save date message attribute is the date
    and time at which the\n   message was saved in the mailbox it is now located in.
    \ Unlike the\n   internal date message attribute defined by [IMAP4rev1], this
    date and\n   time value cannot be set arbitrarily when a message is delivered
    by\n   the IMAP APPEND command.  Also, when a message is delivered to the\n   mailbox
    by the IMAP COPY command [IMAP4rev1] or the IMAP MOVE command\n   [IMAP-MOVE],
    the save date attribute is not copied from the source\n   message.  Instead, the
    current date and time at which the message is\n   delivered to a mailbox MUST
    be used to set the save date attribute.\n   Once calculated, the save date attribute
    MUST NOT change as long as\n   the message is contained within the same mailbox.\n
    \  This means that when the message is copied to another mailbox, the\n   save
    date of the message in the source mailbox remains unaffected;\n   only the new
    copy of the message gets a new save date.  Consequently,\n   when the message
    is moved to another mailbox, either using the MOVE\n   command or a command sequence
    involving the COPY command [IMAP-MOVE],\n   the message always gets a new save
    date in the destination mailbox.\n   For some specific mailboxes, the underlying
    storage may not support\n   the save date attribute.  The handling of this situation
    is described\n   in detail in the next section for each involved IMAP command.\n"

    - "4.2.  FETCH Command and Response Extensions\n   This extension defines one
      new data item for the FETCH command:\n   SAVEDATE\n      The save date of the
      message.\n   This extension defines one new data item for the FETCH response:\n
      \  SAVEDATE\n      A string representing the save date of the message.  However,
      if\n      the underlying mailbox storage does not support the save date\n      message
      attribute, the value returned for the SAVEDATE item is\n      always NIL, rather
      than a string.\n   Example:\n         C: A101 FETCH 998 (SAVEDATE)\n         S:
      * 998 FETCH (SAVEDATE \"01-Jan-2015 18:50:53 +0100\")\n         S: A101 OK Fetch
      completed.\n"

    - "4.3.  SEARCH Command Extension\n   This extension defines four new search keys
      for the SEARCH command:\n   SAVEDBEFORE <date>\n      Messages whose save date
      (disregarding time and timezone) is\n      earlier than the specified date.\n
      \  SAVEDON <date>\n      Messages whose save date (disregarding time and timezone)
      is\n      within the specified date.\n   SAVEDSINCE <date>\n      Messages whose
      save date (disregarding time and timezone) is\n      within or later than the
      specified date.\n   SAVEDATESUPPORTED\n      Matches all messages in the mailbox
      when the underlying storage of\n      that mailbox supports the save date attribute.
      \ Conversely, it\n      matches no messages in the mailbox when the save date
      attribute is\n      not supported.\n   When the underlying storage of a mailbox
      does not support the save\n   date attribute, the SAVEDBEFORE, SAVEDON, and
      SAVEDSINCE search keys\n   MUST use the internal date attribute instead.  In
      the context of the\n   IMAP Multimailbox SEARCH Extension [MULTISEARCH], this
      fallback\n   behavior MUST apply to each mailbox individually, meaning that
      only\n   the mailboxes that lack support for the save date attribute use the\n
      \  internal date attribute instead.\n   Example:\n         C: A102 SEARCH SAVEDON
      28-Dec-2014\n         S: * SEARCH 993 994\n         S: A102 OK Search completed.\n
      \        C: A103 SEARCH SAVEDSINCE 28-Dec-2014\n         S: * SEARCH 993 994
      995 996 997 998 999 1000 1001\n         S: A103 OK Search completed.\n"
