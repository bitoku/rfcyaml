  - "1.  Introduction\n   The Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol (L2TP) [RFC2661] defines\
    \ a general\n   purpose mechanism for tunneling Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP)\
    \ [STD51]\n   sessions over various media.  By design, the operation of L2TP is\n\
    \   insulated from the details of the media from which the PPP session\n   originated.\n\
    \   It is common for PPP sessions to be established using modems\n   connected\
    \ over the public switched telephone network.  The ITU-T\n   Recommendation V.92\
    \ [V92] is one of the standards governing modem\n   operation and it defines procedures\
    \ that enable a client modem to put\n   the call on hold and later, re-establish\
    \ the modem link without\n   having to redial.  While the modem call is on hold,\
    \ the client phone\n   line can be used for another phone call.\n   The L2TP base\
    \ protocol does not provide any means to signal these\n   events from the L2TP\
    \ Access Controller (LAC), where the modem is\n   physically connected, to the\
    \ L2TP Network Server (LNS), where the PPP\n   session is handled.  It may be\
    \ desirable for this information (which\n   is available only on the LAC) to be\
    \ provided to the LNS.\n   This document provides additional L2TP AVPs and control\
    \ messages that\n   may be used to communicate some modem information from the\
    \ LAC to the\n   LNS.  However, it does not define what, if anything, the LNS\
    \ should\n   do with this information.  A sample of the possible actions that\
    \ an\n   LNS may consider are listed in section 5.\n"

  - "2.  Protocol Operation\n   The typical dial in topology looks like this:\n  \

    \     [         ]\n   Remote                           NAS\n   System\n   M is\
    \ the client modem and may be an integral part of the Remote\n   System.  If this\
    \ modem implements V.92, it can ask the server modem\n   SM (a part of the NAS)\
    \ whether the call can be placed on-hold for\n   some period of time.\n   If the\
    \ server modem agrees, the client modem can signal the PSTN to\n   place the call\
    \ on-hold (usually, a flash hook).  The user at the\n   remote system can then\
    \ use the same POTS line where the client modem\n   is connected to make or receive\
    \ another call.\n   In the above scenario, the server modem module can notify\
    \ the rest of\n   the NAS of these events via its usual signaling mechanism. \
    \ The NAS\n   layers can then act on this information as desired.  See section\
    \ 5.\n   for a sample list of possible actions.\n   In the case of L2TP, this\
    \ document looks at this particular topology:\n  +-----+       {      }   +-----+\

    \           LNS\n  System\n   If the LAC implements the functionality described\
    \ here, it can signal\n   to the LNS when the client modem has gone on-hold and\
    \ when it comes\n   back online.\n   This document does not define what, if anything,\
    \ the LNS should do\n   with this information.  A sample of the possible actions\
    \ that an LNS\n   MAY consider are listed in section 5.  However, the LNS MUST\
    \ NOT stop\n   processing otherwise valid data packets arriving from the LAC,\n\
    \   regardless of the current state of the modem on-hold indications.\n"
- title: 2.1.  Typical Modem on Hold Usage Scenario
  contents:
  - "2.1.  Typical Modem on Hold Usage Scenario\n   A user connects to his Internet\
    \ service provider with a V.92-capable\n   modem.  He then starts downloading\
    \ a big file which will take several\n   minutes to complete.\n   While the file\
    \ is being downloaded, a friend calls him.  If the user\n   has call waiting enabled,\
    \ his modem can let him know of the incoming\n   call and he can choose to either\
    \ pick up the incoming call or reject\n   it.  Let's say he chooses to pick up\
    \ the phone to talk to his friend,\n   for example because he recognized the caller's\
    \ phone number.\n   Before the user picks up his phone, he tells his modem to\
    \ go on hold\n   and switch to the incoming call (usually signaled with a \"flash-\n\
    \   hook\").  His modem will then notify the server modem (attached to the\n \
    \  LAC) that it is about to go on hold.  If the server modem agrees, the\n   client\
    \ performs a flash hook so the user can talk to his friend.\n   After talking\
    \ to his friend, the user let's his modem know that it\n   can return to the original\
    \ call (where the server modem has been\n   patiently waiting).  After another\
    \ flash hook, the modems are\n   connected again and the download can continue.\n"

  - "2.2.  Capability Negotiation\n   A LAC MUST NOT send a Modem Status (MDMST) control\
    \ message to an LNS\n   that has not indicated the capability of processing such\

    \ Furthermore, the MDMST control message can only be sent after session\n   establishment\
    \ is successful (i.e., after the LAC has sent either an\n   Incoming-Call-Connected\
    \ (ICCN) or an Outgoing-Call-Connected (OCCN)\n   control message), and before\
    \ the session ends from the LAC's point of\n   view (i.e., before the LAC has\

    \ that due to protocol race conditions, it is possible for a LAC\n   to send a\

- title: 5.  Sample LNS Actions
  contents:
  - "5.  Sample LNS Actions\n   The specific actions taken by an LNS upon receipt\
    \ of a Modem On-Hold\n   Status AVP are implementation dependent.  This document\
    \ does not\n   mandate what, if anything, the LNS should do with this information.\n\
    \   The choice of actions taken by the LNS may have an impact on higher\n   layer\
    \ protocols.  For example, TCP connections and other connection-\n   oriented\
    \ applications may timeout or disconnect during the on-hold\n   time.  The impact\
    \ that those choices may have on these or other\n   protocols is not addressed\
    \ by this document.\n   The following list is a sample of possible actions that\
    \ an LNS\n   implementation might consider.  Note that some of these actions are\n\
    \   not really alternatives, as some of the possibilities preclude\n   others.\n\
    \   *  Temporarily stop polling protocols such as LCP Echo Requests, Link\n  \
    \    Quality Monitoring (LQM), Multilink PPP (MP), etc.\n   *  Drop data packets\
    \ directed to the now on-hold remote client.\n   *  Start a new accounting session,\
    \ to account for the on-hold time.\n   *  Stop or hold accounting until the modem\
    \ returns online again.\n   *  Start a separate time accounting for the time that\
    \ the modem is on\n      hold.\n   Here are a few things that an LNS should probably\
    \ NOT do:\n   *  Buffer data packets directed to the now on-hold remote client.\n\
    \      Reason: How many data packets should be buffered? What would be\n     \
    \         the impact on higher layer protocols such as TCP?  What\n          \
    \    would be the impact caused by the delay introduced when\n              the\
    \ client returns online again?\n   *  Answer TCP keepalives in lieu of the client.\n\
    \      Reason: It may interfere with TCP's recovery once the client\n        \
    \      returns online.\n   *  Stop processing otherwise valid data packets from\
    \ the client.\n      Reason: There is a race condition between the notification\
    \ of\n              the modem returning online and the first packet from the\n\
    \              client because they are delivered on independent channels.\n  \
    \            Dropping valid client packets may lead to a slower\n            \
    \  recovery after returning online due to the forced retries.\n"
