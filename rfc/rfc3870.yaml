  - "1. Introduction\n   RDF is a language designed to support the Semantic Web, by\n\
    \   facilitating resource description and data exchange on the Web.  RDF\n   provides\
    \ common structures that can be used for interoperable data\n   exchange and follows\
    \ the W3C design principles of interoperability,\n   evolution, and decentralization.\n\
    \   While the RDF data model [2] can be serialized in many ways, the W3C\n   has\
    \ defined the RDF/XML syntax [1] to allow RDF to be serialized in\n   an XML format.\
    \  The application/rdf+xml media type allows RDF\n   consumers to identify RDF/XML\
    \ documents so that they can be processed\n   properly.\n   The key words \"MUST\"\
    , \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD\
    \ NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n   document are to\
    \ be interpreted as described in BCP 14, RFC 2119 [6].\n"
- title: 2. application/rdf+xml Registration
  contents:
  - "2. application/rdf+xml Registration\n   This is a media type registration as\
    \ defined in RFC 2048,\n   \"Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME) Part\
    \ Four: Registration\n   Procedures\" [5].\n      MIME media type name: application\n\
    \      MIME subtype name: rdf+xml\n      Required parameters: none\n      Optional\
    \ parameters: charset\n         Same as charset parameter of application/xml,\
    \ defined in RFC\n         3023 [4].\n      Encoding considerations:\n       \
    \  Same as charset parameter of application/xml, defined in RFC\n         3023\
    \ [4].\n      Security considerations:\n         See \"Security Considerations\"\
    \ (Section 6).\n      Interoperability considerations:\n         It is RECOMMENDED\
    \ that RDF documents follow the newer RDF/XML\n         Syntax Grammar [1] as\
    \ opposed to the older RDF Model and Syntax\n         specification [7].\n   \
    \      RDF is intended to allow common information to be exchanged\n         between\
    \ disparate applications.  A basis for building common\n         understanding\
    \ is provided by a formal semantics [3], and\n         applications that use RDF\
    \ should do so in ways that are\n         consistent with this.\n      Published\
    \ specification:\n         see RDF/XML Syntax Grammar [1] and RDF: Concepts and\
    \ Abstract\n         Syntax [2] and the older RDF Model and Syntax [7]\n     \
    \ Applications which use this media type:\n         RDF is device-, platform-,\
    \ and vendor-neutral and is supported\n         by a range of Web user agents\
    \ and authoring tools.\n      Additional information:\n         Magic number(s):\
    \ none\n            Although no byte sequences can be counted on to consistently\n\
    \            identify RDF, RDF documents will have the sequence\n            \"\
    http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#\" to identify\n            the RDF\
    \ namespace. This will usually be towards the top of\n            the document.\n\
    \      File extension(s): .rdf\n      Macintosh File Type Code(s): \"rdf \"\n\

    \ be found on the RDF website:\n         <http://www.w3.org/RDF/>\n      Intended\
    \ usage: COMMON\n      Author/Change controller:\n         The RDF specification\
    \ is a work product of the World Wide Web\n         Consortium.  The W3C and the\
    \ W3C RDF Core Working Group have\n         change control over the specification.\n"
- title: 3.  Fragment Identifiers
  contents:
  - "3.  Fragment Identifiers\n   The rdf:ID and rdf:about attributes can be used\
    \ to define fragments\n   in an RDF document.\n   Section 4.1 of the URI specification\
    \ [8] notes that the semantics of\n   a fragment identifier (part of a URI after\
    \ a \"#\") is a property of\n   the data resulting from a retrieval action, and\
    \ that the format and\n   interpretation of fragment identifiers is dependent\
    \ on the media type\n   of the retrieval result.\n   In RDF, the thing identified\
    \ by a URI with fragment identifier does\n   not necessarily bear any particular\
    \ relationship to the thing\n   identified by the URI alone.  This differs from\
    \ some readings of the\n   URI specification [8], so attention is recommended\
    \ when creating new\n   RDF terms which use fragment identifiers.\n   More details\
    \ on RDF's treatment of fragment identifiers can be found\n   in the section \"\
    Fragment Identifiers\" of the RDF Concepts document\n   [2].\n"
- title: 4.  Historical Considerations
  contents:
  - "4.  Historical Considerations\n   This media type was reserved in RFC 3023 [4],\
    \ saying:\n      RDF documents identified using this MIME type are XML documents\n\
    \      whose content describes metadata, as defined by [7].  As a format\n   \
    \   based on XML, RDF documents SHOULD use the '+xml' suffix\n      convention\
    \ in their MIME content-type identifier.  However, no\n      content type has\
    \ yet been registered for RDF and so this media\n      type should not be used\
    \ until such registration has been\n      completed.\n"
- title: 5.  IANA Considerations
  contents:
  - "5.  IANA Considerations\n   This document calls for registration of a new MIME\
    \ media type,\n   according to the registration in Section 2.\n"
- title: 6.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "6.  Security Considerations\n   RDF is a generic format for exchanging application\
    \ information, but\n   application designers must not assume that it provides\
    \ generic\n   protection against security threats.  RFC 3023 [4], section 10,\n\
    \   discusses security concerns for generic XML, which are also\n   applicable\
    \ to RDF.\n   RDF data can be secured for integrity, authenticity and\n   confidentiality\
    \ using any of the mechanisms available for MIME and\n   XML data, including XML\
    \ signature, XML encryption, S/MIME, OpenPGP or\n   transport or session level\
    \ security (e.g., see [9], especially\n   sections 3.4, 3.5, 3.10, [10], [11],\
    \ [12]).\n   RDF is intended to be used in documents that may make assertions\n\
    \   about anything, and to this end includes a specification of formal\n   semantics\
    \ [3].  The semantics provide a basis for combining\n   information from a variety\
    \ of sources, which may lead to RDF\n   assertions of facts (either by direct\
    \ assertion, or via logical\n   deduction) that are false, or whose veracity is\
    \ unclear.  RDF\n   application designers should not omit consideration of the\n\
    \   reliability of processed information.  The formal semantics of RDF\n   can\
    \ help to enhance reliability, since RDF assertions may be linked\n   to a formal\
    \ description of their derivation.  There is ongoing\n   exploration of mechanisms\
    \ to record and handle provenance of RDF\n   information.  As far as general techniques\
    \ are concerned, these are\n   still areas of ongoing research, and application\
    \ designers must be\n   aware, as always, of \"Garbage-in, Garbage-out\".\n"
