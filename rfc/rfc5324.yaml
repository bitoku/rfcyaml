    - "3.1.  Introduction\n   Fibre Channel (FC) is logically a bidirectional point-to-point
      serial\n   data channel, structured for high performance.  Fibre Channel\n   provides
      a general transport vehicle for higher-level protocols such\n   as Small Computer
      System Interface (SCSI) command sets, the High-\n   Performance Parallel Interface
      (HIPPI) data framing, IP (Internet\n   Protocol), IEEE 802.2, and others.\n
      \  Physically, Fibre Channel is an interconnection of multiple\n   communication
      points, called N_Ports, interconnected either by a\n   switching network, called
      a Fabric, or by a point-to-point link.  A\n   Fibre Channel \"Node\" consists
      of one or more N_Ports.  A Fabric may\n   consist of multiple Interconnect Elements,
      some of which are\n   Switches.  An N_Port connects to the Fabric via a port
      on a Switch\n   called an F_Port.  When multiple FC Nodes are connected to a
      single\n   port on a Switch via an \"Arbitrated Loop\" topology, the Switch
      port\n   is called an FL_Port, and the Nodes' ports are called NL_Ports.  The\n
      \  term Nx_Port is used to refer to either an N_Port or an NL_Port.  The\n   term
      Fx_Port is used to refer to either an F_Port or an FL_Port.  A\n   Switch port,
      which is interconnected to another Switch port via an\n   Inter-Switch Link
      (ISL), is called an E_Port.  A B_Port connects a\n   bridge device with an E_Port
      on a Switch; a B_Port provides a subset\n   of E_Port functionality.\n   Many
      Fibre Channel components, including the Fabric, each Node, and\n   most ports,
      have globally unique names.  These globally unique names\n   are typically formatted
      as World Wide Names (WWNs).  More information\n   on WWNs can be found in [FC-FS-2].
      \ WWNs are expected to be\n   persistent across agent and unit resets.\n   Fibre
      Channel frames contain 24-bit address identifiers that identify\n   the frame's
      source and destination ports.  Each FC port has both an\n   address identifier
      and a WWN.  When a Fabric is in use, the FC\n   address identifiers are dynamic
      and are assigned by a Switch.  Each\n   octet of a 24-bit address represents
      a level in an address hierarchy,\n   with a Domain_ID being the highest level
      of the hierarchy.\n"
    title: 3.1.  Introduction
  - contents:
    - "3.2.  Zoning\n   Zones within a Fabric provide a mechanism to control frame
      delivery\n   between Nx_Ports (\"Hard Zoning\") or to expose selected views
      of Name\n   Server information (\"Soft Zoning\").\n   Communication is only
      possible when the communicating endpoints are\n   members of a common zone.
      \ This technique is similar to virtual\n   private networks in that the Fabric
      has the ability to group devices\n   into Zones.\n   Hard zoning and soft zoning
      are two different means of realizing\n   this.  Hard zoning is enforced in the
      Fabric (i.e., Switches),\n   whereas soft zoning is enforced at the endpoints
      (e.g., Host Bus\n   Adapters) by relying on the endpoints to not send traffic
      to an\n   N_Port_ID not obtained from the Name Server with a few exceptions
      for\n   well known Addresses (e.g., the Name Server).\n   Administrators create
      Zones to increase network security, and prevent\n   data loss or corruption,
      by controlling access between devices or\n   user groups.\n"

    - "3.3.  Virtual Fabrics\n   The standard for an interconnecting Fabric containing
      multiple Fabric\n   Switch elements is [FC-SW-4].  [FC-SW-4] carries forward
      the earlier\n   specification for the operation of a single Fabric in a physical\n
      \  infrastructure, and augments it with the definition of Virtual\n   Fabrics
      and with the specification of how multiple Virtual Fabrics\n   can operate within
      one or more physical infrastructures.  The use of\n   Virtual Fabrics provides
      for each frame to be tagged in its header to\n   indicate which one of several
      Virtual Fabrics that frame is being\n   transmitted on.  All frames entering
      a particular \"Core Switch\"\n   [FC-SW-4] (i.e., a physical Switch) on the
      same Virtual Fabric are\n   processed by the same \"Virtual Switch\" within
      that Core Switch.\n"

    - "3.4.  Security\n   The Fibre Channel Security Protocols (FC-SP) standard [FC-SP]\n
      \  describes the protocols used to implement security in a Fibre Channel\n   Fabric,
      including the definition of:\n      - protocols to authenticate Fibre Channel
      entities,\n      - protocols to set up session keys,\n      - protocols to negotiate
      the parameters required to ensure frame-\n        by-frame integrity and confidentiality,
      and\n      - protocols to establish and distribute (security) policies across\n
      \       a Fibre Channel Fabric.\n"
    - contents:
      - "3.4.1.  Authentication\n   Two entities may negotiate whether authentication
        is required and\n   which Authentication Protocol is to be used.  Authentication
        can be\n   used in Switch-to-Switch, Node-to-Switch, and Node-to-Node\n   communication.
        \ The defined Authentication Protocols are able to\n   perform mutual authentication
        with optional shared key establishment.\n   The shared key computed at the
        end of an Authentication Transaction\n   may be used to establish Security
        Associations.\n   The Fabric security architecture is defined for several\n
        \  authentication infrastructures.  Secret-based, certificate-based, and\n
        \  password-based authentication infrastructures are accommodated.\n   Specific
        authentication protocols that directly leverage these three\n   authentication
        infrastructures are defined.\n   With a secret-based infrastructure, entities
        within the Fabric\n   environment that establish a security relationship share
        a common\n   secret or centralize the secret administration in an external
        (e.g.,\n   RADIUS [RFC2865], Diameter [RFC3588], or Terminal Access Controller\n
        \  Access Control System (TACACS) [RFC1492]) server.  Entities may\n   mutually
        authenticate with other entities by using the Diffie-Hellman\n   Challenge
        Handshake Authentication Protocol (DH-CHAP) [FC-SP].\n   Security Associations
        may be set up using the session key computed at\n   the end of the DH-CHAP
        transaction.\n   With a certificate-based infrastructure, entities within
        the Fabric\n   environment are certified by a trusted Certificate Authority
        (CA).\n   The resulting certificates bind each entity to a public-private
        key\n   pair that may be used to mutually authenticate with other certified\n
        \  entities via the Fibre Channel Certificate Authentication Protocol\n   (FCAP)
        [FC-SP].  Security Associations may be set up by using these\n   entity certificates
        and associated keys or by using the session key\n   computed at the end of
        the FCAP transaction.\n   With a password-based infrastructure, entities within
        the Fabric\n   environment that establish a security relationship have knowledge
        of\n   the password-based credential material of other entities.  Entities\n
        \  may use this credential material to mutually authenticate with other\n
        \  entities using the Fibre Channel Password Authentication Protocol\n   (FCPAP)
        [FC-SP].  Security Associations may be set up using the\n   session key computed
        at the end of the FCPAP transaction.\n   In addition to DH-CHAP, FCAP, and
        FCPAP, one other Authentication\n   Protocol is defined: Internet Key Exchange
        Protocol version 2-AUTH\n   (IKEv2-AUTH), which refers to the use of an SA
        Management Transaction\n   of the Security Association Management Protocol
        (see below) to\n   perform two functions: not only SA management but also\n
        \  authentication.  The credentials used in an IKEv2-AUTH transaction\n   are
        either strong shared secrets or certificates.\n"

      - "3.4.2.  Security Associations\n   A subset of the IKEv2 protocol [RFC4306]
        suitable for Fibre Channel\n   is defined as the (Fibre Channel) Security
        Association Management\n   protocol [RFC4595].  This protocol -- which is
        *not* IPsec --\n   provides the means to establish Security Associations (SAs)
        between\n   Fibre Channel entities.  Traffic Selectors are defined to specify\n
        \  which type of traffic has to be protected by which SA, and what the\n   characteristics
        of the protection are.  Two mechanisms are available\n   to protect specific
        classes of traffic:\n      - ESP_Header is used to protect FC-2 frames (see
        [FC-FS-2] and the\n        conceptually similar mechanisms in [RFC4303]),
        and\n      - CT_Authentication is used to protect CT_IUs (Common Transport\n
        \       Information Units) [FC-GS-5].\n   An entity protecting specific classes
        of traffic maintains an\n   internal Security Association Database (SADB)
        that contains the\n   currently active Security Associations and Traffic Selectors.\n
        \  Each active SA has a Security Association entry in the SADB.  Each SA\n
        \  entry includes the SA's SPI (the Security Parameters Index, which is\n
        \  included in frames transmitted on the SA), a Sequence Number counter,\n
        \  and the parameters for the selected transforms (e.g., encryption\n   algorithm,
        integrity algorithm, mode of operation of the algorithms,\n   keys).\n   Each
        active Traffic Selector has an entry in the SADB that indicates\n   whether
        it is used for ingress traffic or for egress traffic.  These\n   Traffic Selector
        entries are ordered such that they are searched\n   (when checking for a match)
        in the given order.  Two types of Traffic\n   Selector entries may be present:\n
        \     - Traffic Selector entries identifying FC-2 frames or CT_IUs to be\n
        \       bypassed or discarded; and\n      - Traffic Selector entries identifying
        FC-2 frames or CT_IUs to be\n        protected or verified.  These entries
        point to the corresponding\n        SA entry defining the parameters and the
        security processing to\n        be performed.\n   SAs are unidirectional,
        but they always exist as an SA pair of the\n   same type, one in each direction.\n"

      - "3.4.3.  Fabric Security Policies\n   Two separate approaches to defining
        Policies are adopted in FC-SP,\n   but both approaches follow the same general
        concept for their Policy\n   model.  One is the definition of a Policy Model
        for Fabric Policies\n   that focus on Security.  These Security Policies specify
        the\n   membership and connectivity allowed within a Fabric, and also which\n
        \  IP hosts are allowed to manage a Fabric.\n   The other approach is to define
        a variant of the Enhanced Zoning\n   model defined in [FC-SW-4] and [FC-GS-5],
        such that the variant\n   specifies extensions for use in a secure environment.
        \ This variant\n   of Zoning, denoted as \"FC-SP Zoning\", follows the same
        general\n   concepts of the Policy model for Security Policies, but keeps
        Zoning\n   management and enforcement completely independent from the management\n
        \  and enforcement of other policies.\n"

      - "3.4.5.  Policy Objects\n   The Policies to be enforced by a Fabric are specified
        in a set of\n   Policy Objects.  The various types of Policy Objects are:\n
        \     - The Policy Summary Object is a list of pointers to other Policy\n
        \       Objects, one pointer per each other active Policy Object.  Each\n
        \       pointer in a Policy Summary Object is paired with a\n        cryptographic
        hash of the referenced Policy Object.\n      - The Switch Membership List
        Object is a Fabric-wide Policy Object\n        that defines which Switches
        are allowed to be part of a Fabric.\n      - The Node Membership List Object
        is a Fabric-wide Policy Object\n        that defines which Nodes are allowed
        to be connected to a\n        Fabric.\n      - The IP Management List Object
        is a Fabric-wide Policy Object\n        that describes which IP hosts are
        allowed to manage a Fabric.\n      - A Switch Connectivity Object is a per-Switch
        Policy Object that\n        describes the topology restrictions for a specific
        Switch; it\n        specifies the other Switches or Nodes to which the particular\n
        \       Switch may be connected at the Node level and/or at the Port\n        level.\n
        \     - Attribute Objects are Fabric-wide Policy Objects that define\n        optional
        attributes to be associated with Switches or Nodes.\n        They allow the
        extension of this policy model by defining new\n        attributes as required.\n

        m Nodes, the potential\n   complexity of Switch Connectivity Objects is O(n**2)
        to describe\n   Switch to Switch connections, and O(n*m) for Switch to Node\n
        \  connections.  To provide better scaling, the Switch Connectivity\n   Objects
        are not Fabric-wide information, but are distributed only to\n   where they
        are needed.  To support this, the policy model supports\n   three kinds of
        Switches in a Fabric:\n      - Server Switches, which maintain the Fabric-wide
        Policy Objects,\n        all the Switch Connectivity Objects, and a full copy
        of the FC-\n        SP Zoning Database;\n      - Autonomous Switches, which
        maintain the Fabric-wide Policy\n        Objects, their own Switch Connectivity
        Object, and a full copy\n        of the FC-SP Zoning Database; and\n      -

        Zone Set (which is the configurations of zones currently\n        being enforced

        a server session [FC-GS-5] with a\n   Security Policy Server.  All write access
        to a Security Policy Server\n   occurs within a server session.  While read
        access to a Security\n   Policy Server may occur at any time, the consistency
        of the returned\n   data is guaranteed only inside a server session.\n   The
        Enhanced Commit Service [FC-SW-4] is used to perform Fabric\n   operations

        Zoning definitions\n   and implementations, FC-SP Zoning is defined as a variant
        of the\n   Enhanced Zoning model defined in [FC-SW-4] and [FC-GS-5] that follows\n
        \  the general concepts of the Policy model for Security Policy\n   Management,
        but keeps Zoning management and enforcement completely\n   independent.\n
        \  FC-SP Zoning allows for some Switches to retain less than a complete\n
        \  replicated copy of the Zoning Database, as follows:\n      - Server Switches
        maintain the policies data structures for all\n        Switches in the Fabric
        plus a replica of the Zoning data\n        structures;\n      - Autonomous
        Switches maintain only the subset of policies data\n        structures relevant
        for their operations plus a replica of the\n        Zoning Database; and\n
        \     - Client Switches maintain only the subset of policies data\n        structures
        and the subset of the Active Zone Set relevant for\n        their operations.\n
        \  When Client Switches are deployed in a Fabric, at least one Server\n   Switch
        must also be deployed in the same Fabric.  A client-server\n   protocol allows
        Client Switches to dynamically retrieve the Zoning\n   information they may
        require from the Server Switches.\n   A management application manages the
        Fabric Zoning configuration\n   through the Fabric Zone Server, while other
        policies are managed\n   through the Security Policy Server.  A new Zoning
        Check Protocol\n   replaces the Zone Merge Protocol [FC-SW-4], and new command
        codes are\n   defined for the SFC SW_ILS to distribute the FC-SP Zoning\n
        \  configuration on a Fabric.  The Zoning definitions are ordered to\n   allow
        for the computation of a hash of the Active Zone Set and a hash\n   of the
        Zone Set Database, plus other optional security data (e.g.,\n   for integrity

      functionality.  Fibre\n   Channel functionality may be grouped into Fibre Channel
      management\n   instances in whatever way is most convenient for the\n   implementation(s).
      \ For example, one such grouping accommodates a\n   single SNMP agent having
      multiple AgentX [RFC2741] sub-agents, with\n   each sub-agent implementing a
      different Fibre Channel management\n   instance.\n   The object, fcmInstanceIndex,
      is IMPORTed from the FC-MGMT-MIB\n   [RFC4044] as the index value to uniquely

      entity with which it is communicating.  Examples of\n   such entities are Fibre
      Channel Switches and Fibre Channel Nx_Ports.\n   Each entity is identified by
      a name.  The FC-MGMT-MIB [RFC4044]\n   defines MIB objects for such names:\n

      by the same Fibre Channel management instance.  In\n        this case, each
      entity is a Switch and has the name given by the\n        MIB object, fcmSwitchWWN.\n
      \     - for entities other than Fibre Channel Switches, a Fibre Channel\n        management
      instance can manage only one entity, and the name of\n        the entity is

      arbitrary integer, named a \"Fabric Index\".  The syntax of a Fabric\n   Index
      is T11FabricIndex, imported from T11-TC-MIB [RFC4439].  When a\n   device is

      \  specified/instantiated on a per-port/interface basis, e.g., for:\n   statistics,
      Traffic Selectors, Security Associations, etc.  This\n   allows the same object
      to be used either when there is a separate row\n   for each of multiple ports/interfaces,
      or when multiple interfaces\n   are represented by a single row.  The use of
      a zero value supports\n   the simpler cases of: a) when there is only one port/interface,
      b)\n   where the implementation chooses to aggregate the information for\n   multiple
      ports/interfaces.  The minimum (for compliance) requirement\n   is to implement
      any one of the above cases.\n   When a Fabric Index and an object with the InterfaceIndexOrZero\n
      \  syntax are used together in a single INDEX clause, the\n   InterfaceIndexOrZero

      are two Textual\n   Conventions defined in this document (in the T11-FC-SP-TC-MIB
      module)\n   to represent the types and values of Policy Object Names (see section\n
      \  3.4.5.1 above).  However, two of the nine possible types are IPv4\n   Address
      Range and IPv6 Address Range.  It is standard practice in MIB\n   modules to
      represent all IP addresses using the standard Textual\n   Conventions defined
      in [RFC4001] for IP addresses: specifically,\n   InetAddressType and InetAddress.
      \ This document adheres to such\n   standard practice to the following extent:\n
      \     - for MIB objects representing a Policy Object Name that can\n        *only*
      be an IPv4 Address Range or an IPv6 Address Range, then\n        those MIB objects
      are defined as a 3-tuple: (InetAddressType,\n        InetAddress, InetAddress),
      in which the first address is the low\n        end of the range, the second
      address is the high end of the\n        range, and both addresses are of the
      type given by\n        InetAddressType.\n      - for MIB objects representing
      a Policy Object Name that is\n        (possibly) of a different type, i.e.,
      it is not (necessarily) an\n        IPv4 or IPv6 Address Range, then those MIB
      objects are defined\n        as a 2-tuple: (T11FcSpPolicyNameType, T11FcSpPolicyName),
      in\n        which the first object represents the type of Policy Object Name\n
      \       and the second object represents the value of the Policy Object\n        Name.
      \ For MIB objects defined in this manner, if and when they\n        represent
      a range of IP addresses: a) the value of\n        T11FcSpPolicyNameType differentiates
      between an IPv4 Address\n        Range and an IPv6 Address Range; and b) the
      value of\n        T11FcSpPolicyName is one string containing the concatenation
      of\n        the two addresses that are the low and high addresses of the\n        range.

      that\n   corresponds to the certificate, and with the Root Certificate (the\n

      ingress or egress\n   frame in order to determine the security processing to
      be applied to\n   that frame, there are circumstances in which multiple Traffic\n
      \  Selectors, specifying different actions, can match with the frame.\n   Specifically,
      when matching against an egress frame to decide which\n   active Security Association
      to transmit on, or, against an ingress\n   frame unprotected by FC-SP, i.e.,
      without an SPI value in it, to\n   decide which action ('drop' or 'bypass')
      to apply.  For these cases,\n   the MIB includes a unique precedence value for
      each Traffic Selector\n   such that the one with the numerically lowest precedence
      value is\n   determined to be the one that matches.  In contrast, ingress frames\n
      \  on active Security Associations (i.e., protected by FC-SP) are\n   compared
      against the set of traffic selectors negotiated when the\n   Security Association
      was set up and identified by the SPI value\n   contained in the frame; the action
      taken depends on whether any\n   Traffic Selector matches, but not on which
      one.\n   This difference between ingress and egress Traffic Selectors on\n   active

    - "4.9.  Rate Control for Notifications\n   All but one of the notifications defined
      in the five MIB modules in\n   this document are notifications that are generated
      based on events\n   occurring in the \"control plane\", e.g., notifications
      that are\n   generated at the frequency of operator-initiated activities.  The
      one\n   exception is t11FcSpSaNotifyAuthFailure, which is generated based on\n
      \  an event occurring in the \"data plane\", and could (in a worst case\n   scenario)
      occur for every received ingress frame.  Therefore, a\n   method of rate controlling
      the generation of notifications is needed\n   for t11FcSpSaNotifyAuthFailure,
      but not for any of the other\n   notifications.\n   For t11FcSpSaNotifyAuthFailure,
      rate control is achieved by\n   specifying that a) after the first occurrence
      of an Authentication\n   failure on any particular Security Association, the
      SNMP\n   notifications for second and subsequent failures are suppressed for\n
      \  the duration of a time window and b) that even the notification for\n   the
      first occurrence is suppressed after it is sent in the same time\n   window
      for a configured (in t11FcSpSaControlMaxNotifs) number of\n   Security Associations
      within a Fabric.  Note that while these\n   suppressions prevent the network
      from being flooded with\n   notifications, the Authentication Failures themselves
      must still be\n   detected and counted.\n   The length of the time window is
      given by t11FcSpSaControlWindow, a\n   read-write object in the t11FcSpSaControlTable.
      \ If and when the time\n   since the last generation of the notification is
      less than the value\n   of sysUpTime (e.g., if one or more notifications have
      occurred since\n   the last re-initialization of the management system), then\n
      \  t11FcSpSaControlElapsed and t11FcSpSaControlSuppressed contain the\n   elapsed
      time since the last notification and the number of\n   notifications suppressed
      in the window after sending the last one,\n   respectively.  Otherwise, t11FcSpSaControlElapsed
      contains the value\n   of sysUpTime and t11FcSpSaControlSuppressed has the value
      zero.\n"

  - "5.  Relationship to Other MIB Modules\n   The first standardized MIB module for
    Fibre Channel [RFC2837] was\n   focused on Fibre Channel Switches.  It was obsoleted
    by the more\n   generic Fibre Channel Management MIB [RFC4044], which defines
    basic\n   information for Fibre Channel Nodes and Switches, including\n   extensions
    to the standard IF-MIB [RFC2863] for Fibre Channel\n   interfaces.  Several other
    MIB modules have since been defined to\n   extend [RFC4044] for various specific
    Fibre Channel functionality,\n   (e.g., [RFC4438], [RFC4439], [RFC4625], [RFC4626],
    [RFC4747],\n   [RFC4936], [RFC4935], and [RFC4983]).\n   The MIB modules defined
    in this memo further extend [RFC4044] to\n   cover the operation of Fibre Channel
    Security Protocols, as specified\n   in [FC-SP].\n   One part of the FC-SP specification
    is \"FC-SP Zoning\", which is an\n   extension/variant of the Fibre Channel Zoning
    defined in [FC-GS-5].\n   Management information for the latter is defined in
    the T11-FC-ZONE-\n   SERVER-MIB module [RFC4936].  Consequently, the T11-FC-SP-ZONING-MIB\n
    \  module defined in this document defines the extensions to the T11-FC-\n   ZONE-SERVER-MIB
    module that are needed to manage FC-SP Zoning.\n   The MIB modules in this memo
    import some common Textual Conventions\n   from T11-TC-MIB, defined in [RFC4439],
    and from INET-ADDRESS-MIB,\n   defined in [RFC4001].\n   If the RADIUS protocol
    is used for access to an external server,\n   information about RADIUS Servers
    is likely to be available from the\n   RADIUS-AUTH-CLIENT-MIB [RFC4668].\n"

      \   DESCRIPTION\n           \"When some kind of 'database' is defined in a set
      of\n           read-write MIB objects, it is common that multiple changes\n
      \          in the data need to be made at the same time.  So, if hash\n           values
      are maintained for that data, those hash values are\n           only correct
      if and when they are re-calculated after every\n           change.  In such
      circumstances, the use of an object with\n           this syntax allows the
      re-calculation of the hash values to\n           be deferred until all changes
      have been made, and therefore\n           the calculation need only be done
      once after all changes,\n           rather than repeatedly/after each individual
      change.\n           The definition of an object defined using this TC is\n           required
      to specify which one or more instances of which\n           MIB objects contain
      the hash values operated upon (or\n           whose status is given) by the

      is a request to re-calculate\n           and update the values of the corresponding
      instances of the\n           identified MIB objects.  Writing a value of 'correct'

      and capitalization, even though such\n           mechanisms are less effective
      when used in descriptors.\n           Some types of Policy Objects contain multiple
      items of\n           information, each of which are held in the same format\n
      \          within the Policy Object.  In such cases, FC-SP uses the\n           term
      'Entry' to describe each instance of the common format.\n           For example,
      FC-SP defines an Attribute Policy Object as\n           containing one or more
      'Attribute Entries'.  Again, this MIB\n           module attempts to avoid confusion
      by the use of adjectives\n           and capitalization to distinguish an Entry
      within a Policy\n           Object from an entry within a MIB table.\n           A
      Fabric's database of Policy Objects consists of a set of\n           active
      Objects that are to be enforced by that Fabric, as\n           well as non-active
      Objects that are not enforced.\n           Operations defined (in FC-SP) for
      Policy Management are:\n            - Add/Get/Remove operations on individual
      non-active\n              Policy Objects,\n            - Activate/Deactivate
      operations on a Policy Summary\n              Object, and\n            - Get
      operations on the active Policy Summary Object\n              and/or on individual
      active Policy Objects.\n           This MIB module has five parts:\n            1)
      Active Policy Objects - read-only MIB objects\n               representing the
      set of active Policy Objects for\n               each Fabric,\n            2)
      Activate/Deactivate Operations\n               - a read-write MIB object to
      invoke an Activate\n                 operation of the policies specified via
      a non-active\n                 Policy Summary Object, and\n               -
      a read-write MIB object to invoke a Deactivate\n                 operation.\n
      \           3) Non-active Policy Objects\n               - read-create MIB objects
      to allow the creation of\n                 non-active Policy Summary Objects
      (which reference\n                 non-active Policy Objects), and\n               -
      read-create MIB objects representing non-active\n                 Policy Objects.\n

      \          Policy Summary Objects in the Policy Database.  Instead,\n           FC-SP
      requires a new Policy Summary Object to be created\n           for, and embedded
      within, every Activate (APS) request.\n           Thus, the newly created Policy
      Summary Object outlasts the\n           APS request only as the new active Policy
      Summary Object and\n           only if the APS succeeds.  In contrast, the Activate\n
      \          operation provided by this MIB module consists of two steps:\n           1)
      create a non-active Policy Summary Object as a set of\n              entries

      \   DESCRIPTION\n           \"This MIB module specifies the management information\n
      \          required to manage Security Associations established via\n           Fibre
      Channel's FC-SP specification.\n           The MIB module consists of six parts:\n
      \          - a per-Fabric table, t11FcSpSaIfTable, of capabilities,\n             parameters,
      status information, and counters; the counters\n             include non-transient
      aggregates of per-SA transient\n             counters;\n           - three tables,
      t11FcSpSaPropTable, t11FcSpSaTSelPropTable,\n             and t11FcSpSaTransTable,
      specifying the proposals for an\n             FC-SP entity acting as an SA_Initiator
      to present to the\n             SA_Responder during the negotiation of Security\n
      \            Associations.  The same information is also used by an\n             FC-SP
      entity acting as an SA_Responder to decide what to\n             accept during
      the negotiation of Security Associations.\n             One of these tables,
      t11FcSpSaTransTable, is used not only\n             for information about security
      transforms to propose and\n             to accept, but also as agreed upon during
      the negotiation\n             of Security Associations;\n           - a table,
      t11FcSpSaTSelDrByTable, of Traffic Selectors\n             having the security
      action of 'drop' or 'bypass' to be\n             applied either to ingress traffic
      that is unprotected by\n             FC-SP, or to all egress traffic;\n           -
      four tables, t11FcSpSaPairTable, t11FcSpSaTSelNegInTable,\n             t11FcSpSaTSelNegOutTable,
      and t11FcSpSaTSelSpiTable,\n             containing information about active
      bidirectional pairs of\n             Security Associations; in particular, t11FcSpSaPairTable\n
      \            has one row per active bidirectional SA pair,\n             t11FcSpSaTSelNegInTable
      and t11FcSpSaTSelNegOutTable\n             contain information on the Traffic
      Selectors negotiated on\n             the SAs, and the t11FcSpSaTSelSpiTable
      is an alternate\n             lookup table such that the Traffic Selector(s)
      in use on a\n             particular Security Association can be quickly determined\n
      \            based on the (ingress) SPI value;\n           - a table, t11FcSpSaControlTable,
      of control and other\n             information concerning the generation of
      notifications for\n             events related to FC-SP Security Associations;\n
      \          - one notification, t11FcSpSaNotifyAuthFailure, generated on\n             the
      occurrence of an Authentication failure for a received\n             FC-2 or

      there is\n   no direct read or write access via a management protocol, such
      as\n   SNMP, to these definitions.  Nevertheless, it does include the\n   assignment
      of enumerations and OIDs to represent cryptographic\n   algorithms/transforms,

    - "8.7.  Recommendations Common to All MIB Modules\n   SNMP versions prior to
      SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.\n   Even if the network itself is
      secure (for example by using IPsec),\n   even then, there is no control as to
      who on the secure network is\n   allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete)
      the objects\n   in this MIB module.\n   It is RECOMMENDED that implementors
      consider the security features as\n   provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see
      [RFC3410], section 8),\n   including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic
      mechanisms (for\n   authentication and privacy).\n   Further, deployment of
      SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT\n   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED
      to deploy SNMPv3 and to\n   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator\n
      \  responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an\n   instance
      of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to\n   the objects
      only to those principals (users) that have legitimate\n   rights to indeed GET
      or SET (change/create/delete) them.\n   Because the two algorithms currently
      specified for\n   T11FcSpPolicyHashFormat are SHA-1 and SHA-256, the definition
      of\n   T11FcSpHashCalculationStatus expresses a concern in regard to not\n   incrementally
      recomputing the hashes after each change when a series\n   of multiple related
      changes are being made.  This method of reducing\n   computation is intended
      as a responsiveness measure (i.e.,\n   cooperating SNMP managers and agents
      can get things done faster), not\n   as a Denial-of-Service (DoS) countermeasure.
      \ Nevertheless,\n   implementations should also consider the DoS possibilities
      in these\n   scenarios; potential countermeasures include: requiring\n   authentication
      for SETs and the rate-limiting of SET operations if\n   they can cause significant
      computation.\n"
