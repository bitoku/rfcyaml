    \  organizations  in the ARPA Internet  community have RAPICOM 450\nfacsimile\
    \   machines   interfaced   to  computers.   This  allows  these\norganizations\
    \  to enter a facsimile  representation  of a  page  into  a\ncomputer  file,\
    \ and to produce a page from stored facsimile data.  These\norganizations  can\
    \ exchange  stored facsimile data via file transfer and\nother protocols.   The\
    \ purpose  of this note is to document  the  format\nused for  these  files  so\
    \  that  other  organizations  with  compatible\nfacsimile devices can join in\
    \ this information exchange procedure.\nThe Rapicom 450:\nThe Rapicom  450 has\
    \ a built in encoding/decoding  scheme.   It produces\ndata blocks  of 585 bits.\
    \   There are \"set up\" blocks and \"data\" blocks.\nThe machine sends/receives\
    \ several copies of the set up block, but since\nthey are identical only one set\
    \ up block is stored in the file.\nRecords:\nEach 585 bit block  is placed  in\
    \ a record  of 8-bit  bytes.  The record\nformat is a length byte, a command byte\
    \ and the data bytes.  Each record\nis an integral  number  of bytes.   The length\
    \ value includes the length\nbyte and the command  byte.   The command describes\
    \ the data in the data\nfield.\n   0        1        2        3              \

    \               | \n                      Rapicom 450 Facsimile Record\nCommands:\n\
    56 - SET-UP\n  The command code 56 (70 octal) indicates the following data field\
    \ is a\n  set up block.\nRapicom 450 Facsimile File Format                   \
    \             RFC 769\n57 - DATA\n  The command code 57 (71 octal) indicates the\
    \ following data field is a\n  data block.\n58 - END\n  The command  code 58 (72\
    \ octal) indicates that this is the last record\n  in the file.   In this case\
    \ the length may be 2, indicating that there\n  is no data in this record.\nConventions:\n\
    In the files exchanged  to date,  each record  contains one block.  This\nmeans\
    \ the data field is 74 bytes long  (585/8=73.125),  and  the  length\nfield  has\
    \ the value  76 (114 octal),  except  the last record which may\ncarry no data\
    \ and have a length of 2.\nThe first  record  of a file is always  a SET UP record,\
    \  the  following\nrecords are DATA records, until the last record which is an\
    \ END record.\nDetails:\nThe 585 bit data  block  is encoded by the Rapicom 450\
    \ and so can not be\nused a bit map unless the encoding/decoding procedure is\
    \ known and used.\nThe first 24 bits of the block is always a synchronization\
    \ mark with the\nvalue 271 141 344 in octal or 101110010110000111100100 in binary.\n\
    The low order  two bits of the  next  byte  contain  a  sequence  number\n(modulo\
    \ 4).  The sequence number bits cycle in the order 11, 01, 10, 00,\nstarting with\
    \ the first DATA record (not the SET UP record).\nThe line below represents  a\
    \ DATA record,  where L represents  a  length\nbit,  C represents a command bit,\
    \ M represents the synchronization mark,\nS represents  a  sequence  bit,  F \
    \ represents  a  fill  bit,  the  dash\nrepresents 68 other data octets, and an\
    \ D represents a data bit.\nLLLLLLLLCCCCCCCCMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMDDDDDDSSDDDDDDDD-DFFFFFFF\n\
    In the line below  the normal values have been filled in for the length,\nthe\
    \ command, the synchronization mark and fill bits.\n0100110000111001101110010110000111100100DDDDDDSSDDDDDDDD-D0000000\n"
