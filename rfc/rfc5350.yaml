  - "1.  Introduction\n   The IP Router Alert Option is defined for IPv4 in [RFC2113].\
    \  A\n   similar IPv6 option is defined in [RFC2711].  When one of these\n   options\
    \ is present in an IP datagram, it indicates that the contents\n   of the datagram\
    \ may be interesting to routers.  The Router Alert\n   Option (RAO) is used by\
    \ protocols such as the Resource Reservation\n   Protocol (RSVP) [RFC2205] and\
    \ IGMP [RFC3376].\n   Both the IPv4 and IPv6 options contain a two-octet Value\
    \ field to\n   carry extra information.  This information can be used, for example,\n\
    \   by routers to determine whether or not the packet should be more\n   closely\
    \ examined by them.\n   There can be up to 65536 values for the RAO.  Yet, currently\
    \ there is\n   only a registry for IPv6 values.  No registry or allocation policies\n\
    \   are defined for IPv4.\n   This document updates the IANA registry for managing\
    \ IPv4 and IPv6\n   Router Alert Option Values, and removes one existing IPv6\
    \ Router\n   Alert Option Value.\n"
- title: 2.  Use of the Router Alert Option Value Field
  contents:
  - "2.  Use of the Router Alert Option Value Field\n   One difference between the\
    \ specifications for the IPv4 and IPv6\n   Router Alert Options is the way values\
    \ for the Value field are\n   managed.  In [RFC2113], the IPv4 Router Alert Option\
    \ Value field has\n   the value 0 assigned to \"Router shall examine packet\"\
    .  All other\n   values (1-65535) are reserved.  Neither a management mechanism\
    \ (e.g.,\n   an IANA registry) nor an allocation policy are provided for the IPv4\n\
    \   RAO values.\n   The IPv6 Router Alert Option has an IANA-managed registry\n\
    \   [IANA-IPv6RAO] containing allocations for the Value field.\n   In [RFC3175],\
    \ the IPv4 Router Alert Option Value is described as a\n   parameter that provides\
    \ \"additional information\" to the router in\n   making its interception decision,\
    \ rather than as a registry managed\n   by IANA.  As such, this aggregation mechanism\
    \ makes use of the Value\n   field to carry the reservation aggregation level.\
    \  For the IPv6\n   option, IANA has assigned a set of 32 values to indicate reservation\n\
    \   levels.  However, since other registrations have already been made in\n  \
    \ that registry, these values are from 3-35 (which is actually a set of\n   33\
    \ values).\n   Although it might have been desirable to have the same values used\
    \ in\n   both the IPv4 and IPv6 registries, the initial allocations in\n   [RFC2711]\
    \ and the aggregation-level allocations in [RFC3175] have\n   made this impossible.\
    \  The following table shows the allocations in\n   the IPv6 registry and the\
    \ values used in the IPv4 registry, where the\n   latter have been deduced from\
    \ [RFC2113] and [RFC3175] with the\n   assumption that the number of aggregation\
    \ levels can be limited to 32\n   as in the IPv6 case.  Entries for values 6 to\
    \ 31 have been elided for\n   brevity.\n   +----------+-------------------------+------------------------------+\n\

    \   Note (*): The entry in the above table for the IPv6 RAO Value of 35\n   (Aggregated\
    \ Reservation Nesting Level 32) has been marked due to an\n   inconsistency in\
    \ the text of [RFC3175], and is consequently reflected\n   in the IANA registry.\
    \  In that document, the values 3-35 (i.e., 33\n   values) are defined for nesting\
    \ levels 0-31 (i.e., 32 levels).\n   Similarly, value 3 is a duplicate, because\
    \ aggregation level 0 means\n   end-to-end signaling, and this already has an\
    \ IPv6 RAO value \"1\"\n   assigned.\n   Also note that nesting levels begin at\
    \ 1 for IPv4 (described in\n   Section 1.4.9 of [RFC3175]) and 0 for IPv6 (allocated\
    \ in Section 6 of\n   [RFC3175]).\n   Section 3.2 of this document redefines these\
    \ so that for IPv6, value\n   3 is no longer used and values 4-35 represent levels\
    \ 1-32.  This\n   removes the above inconsistencies.\n"
- title: 3.  IANA Considerations

  - "3.  IANA Considerations\n   This section contains the new procedures for managing\
    \ IPv4 Router\n   Alert Option Values.  IANA has created a registry for IPv4 Router\n\
    \   Alert Option Values (described in Section 3.1) and has updated the\n   IPv6\
    \ Router Alert Option Values (described in Section 3.2).\n   IP Router Alert Option\
    \ Values are currently managed separately for\n   IPv4 and IPv6.  This document\
    \ does not change this, as there is\n   little value in forcing the two registries\
    \ to be aligned.\n"

- title: 4.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "4.  Security Considerations\n   Since this document is only concerned with the\
    \ IANA management of the\n   IPv4 and IPv6 Router Alert Option Values registry,\
    \ it raises no new\n   security issues beyond those identified in [RFC2113] and\
    \ [RFC2711].\n   Yet, as discussed in RFC 4727 [RFC4727], production networks\
    \ do not\n   necessarily support the use of experimental code points in IP option\n\
    \   headers.  The network scope of support for experimental values should\n  \
    \ be evaluated carefully before deploying any experimental RAO value\n   across\
    \ extended network domains, such as the public Internet.  The\n   potential to\
    \ disrupt the stable operation of the network hosting the\n   experiment through\
    \ the use of unsupported experimental code points is\n   a serious consideration\
    \ when planning an experiment using such code\n   points.\n   When experimental\
    \ RAO values are deployed within an administratively\n   self-contained network\
    \ domain, the network administrators should\n   ensure that each value is used\
    \ consistently to avoid interference\n   between experiments.  When experimental\
    \ values are used in traffic\n   that crosses multiple administrative domains,\
    \ the experimenters\n   should assume that there is a risk that the same values\
    \ will be used\n   simultaneously by other experiments, and thus that there is\
    \ a\n   possibility that the experiments will interfere.  Particular\n   attention\
    \ should be given to security threats that such interference\n   might create.\n"
