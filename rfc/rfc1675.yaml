- title: Overview and Rationale
  contents:
  - "Overview and Rationale\n   A number of the candidates for IPng have some features\
    \ that are\n   somewhat worrisome from a security perspective.  While it is not\n\
    \   necessary that IPng be an improvement over IPv4, it is mandatory that\n  \
    \ it not make things worse.  Below, I outline a number of areas of\n   concern.\
    \  In some cases, there are features that would have a\n   negative impact on\
    \ security if nothing else is done.  It may be\n   desirable to adopt the features\
    \ anyway, but in that case, the\n   corrective action is mandatory.\n"
- title: Firewalls
  contents:
  - "Firewalls\n   For better or worse, firewalls are very much a feature of today's\n\
    \   Internet.  They are not, primarily, a response to network protocol\n   security\
    \ problems per se.  Rather, they are a means to compensate for\n   failings in\
    \ software engineering and system administration.  As such,\n   firewalls are\
    \ not likely to go away any time soon; IPng will do\n   nothing to make host programs\
    \ any less buggy.  Anything that makes\n   firewalls harder to deploy will make\
    \ IPng less acceptable in the\n   market.\n   Firewalls impose a number of requirements.\
    \  First, there must be a\n   hierarchical address space.  Many address-based\
    \ filters use the\n   structure of IPv4 addresses for access control decisions.\n\
    \   Fortunately, this is a requirement for scalable routing as well.\n   Routers,\
    \ though, only need access to the destination address of the\n   packet.  Network-level\
    \ firewalls often need to check both the source\n   and destination address. \
    \ A structure that makes it harder to find\n   the source address is a distinct\
    \ negative.\n   There is also a need for access to the transport-level (i.e.,\
    \ the TCP\n   or UDP) header.  This may be for the port number field, or for access\n\
    \   to various flag bits, notably the ACK bit in the TCP header.  This\n   latter\
    \ field is used to distinguish between incoming and outgoing\n   calls.\n   In\
    \ a different vein, at least one of the possible transition plans\n   uses network-level\
    \ packet translators [1].  Organizations that use\n   firewalls will need to deploy\
    \ their own translators to aid in\n   converting their own internal networks.\
    \  They cannot rely on\n   centrally-located translators intended to serve the\
    \ entire Internet\n   community.  It is thus vital that translators be simple,\
    \ portable to\n   many common platforms, and cheap -- we do not want to impose\
    \ too high\n   a financial barrier for converts to IPng.\n   By the same token,\
    \ it is desirable that such translation boxes not be\n   usable for network-layer\
    \ connection-laundering.  It is difficult\n   enough to trace back attacks today;\
    \ we should not make it harder.\n   (Some brands of terminal servers can be used\
    \ for laundering.  Most\n   sites with such boxes have learned to configure them\
    \ so that such\n   activities are impossible.)  Comprehensive logging is a possible\n\
    \   alternative.\n   IPAE [1] does not have problems with its translation strategy,\
    \ as\n   address are (insofar as possible) preserved; it is necessary to avoid\n\
    \   any alternative strategies, such as circuit-level translators, that\n   might.\n"
- title: Encryption and Authentication
  contents:
  - "Encryption and Authentication\n   A number of people are starting to experiment\
    \ with IP-level\n   encryption and cryptographic authentication.  This trend will\
    \ (and\n   should) continue.  IPng should not make this harder, either\n   intrinsically\
    \ or by imposing a substantial perforance barrier.\n   Encryption can be done\
    \ with various different granularities: host to\n   host, host to gateway, and\
    \ gateway to gateway.  All of these have\n   their uses; IPng must not rule out\
    \ any of them.  Encapsulation and\n   tunneling strategies are somewhat problematic,\
    \ as the packet may no\n   longer carry the original source address when it reaches\
    \ an\n   encrypting gateway.  (This may be seen more as a constraint on\n   network\
    \ topologies.  So be it, but we should warn people of the\n   limitation.)\n \
    \  Dual-stack approaches, such as in TUBA's transition plan [2], imply\n   multiple\
    \ addresses for each host.  (IPAE has this feature, too.) The\n   encryption and\
    \ access control infrastructure needs to know about all\n   addresses for a given\
    \ host, belonging to whichever stack.  It should\n   not be possible to bypass\
    \ authentication or encryption by asking for\n   a different address for the same\
    \ host.\n"
- title: Source Routing and Address-based Authentication
  contents:
  - "Source Routing and Address-based Authentication\n   The dominant form of host\
    \ authentication in today's Internet is\n   address-based.  That is, hosts often\
    \ decide to trust other hosts\n   based on their IP addresses.  (Actually, it's\
    \ worse than that; much\n   authentication is name-based, which opens up new avenues\
    \ of attack.\n   But if an attacker can spoof an IP address, there's no need to\
    \ attack\n   the name service.)  To the extent that it does work, address-based\n\
    \   authentication relies on the implied accuracy of the return route.\n   That\
    \ is, though it is easy to inject packets with a false source\n   address, replies\
    \ will generally follow the usual routing patterns,\n   and be sent to the real\
    \ host with that address.  This frustrates\n   most, though not all, attempts\
    \ at impersonation.\n   Problems can arise if source-routing is used.  A source\
    \ route, which\n   must be reversed for reply packets, overrides the usual routing\n\
    \   mechanism, and hence destroys the security of address-based\n   authentication.\
    \  For this reason, many organizations disable source-\n   routing, at least at\
    \ their border routers.\n   One candidate IPng -- SIPP -- includes source-routing\
    \ as an important\n   component.  To the extent this is used, it is a breaks address-based\n\
    \   authentication.  This may not be bad; in fact, it is probably good.\n   But\
    \ it is vital that a more secure cryptographic authentication\n   protocol be\
    \ defined and deployed before any substantial cutover to\n   source routing, if\
    \ SIPP is adopted.\n"
- title: Accounting
  contents:
  - "Accounting\n   An significant part of the world wishes to do usage-sensitive\n\
    \   accounting.  This may be for billing, or it may simply be to\n   accomodate\
    \ quality-of-service requests.  Either way, definitive\n   knowledge of the relevant\
    \ address fields is needed.  To accomodate\n   this, IPng should have a non-intrusive\
    \ packet authentication\n   mechanism.  By \"non-intrusive\", I mean that it should\
    \ (a) present\n   little or no load to intermediate hops that do not need to do\n\
    \   authentication; (b) be deletable (if desired) by the border gateways,\n  \
    \ and (c) be ignorable by end-systems or billing systems to which it is\n   not\
    \ relevant.\n"
