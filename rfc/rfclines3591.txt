Abstract This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB) for use with Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) in TCP/IP  based internets.
In particular, it defines objects for managing Optical Interfaces associated with WavelengthDivision Multiplexing systems or characterized by the Optical Transport Network (OTN) in accordance with the OTN architecture defined in ITU T Recommendation G.872.
The MIB module defined in this memo can be used for performance monitoring and/or configuration of such optical interface.
The Internet Standard Management Framework
For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current Internet Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of RFC 3410 [RFC3410].
Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed the Management Information Base or MIB.
MIB objects are generally accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the Structure of Management Information (SMI).
This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58, RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58
, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
In this document, the term OTN (Optical Transport Network) system is used to describe devices that are compliant with the requirements specified in the ITU T Recommendations G.872 [ITU T G.872], G.709 [ITU T G.709], G.798 [ITU T G.798], G.874 [ITU T G.874], and G.874.1 [ITU T G.874.1].
The optical objects will be managed using the MIB II ifTable and ifStackTable.
Additional tables will also be supported to monitor layer specific status and provide performance monitoring data.
In the tables, some entries are required for OTN systems only.
A Configuration (Config) table, Current Performance Monitoring (PM) table, and Interval PM table will be maintained for the OTSn, OMSn, OChGroup, and OCh layers on a source and sink trail termination basis.
These tables will be linked to the ifTable by using the ifIndex that is associated with that layer.
These objects are used when the particular media being used to realize an interface is an Optical Transport interface.
At present, this applies to these values of the ifType variable in the Internet  standard MIB: opticalChannel (195), opticalChannelGroup (219), opticalTransport (196)
The definitions contained herein are based on the OTN specifications in ITU T G.872[ITU T G.872], G.709 [ITU T G.709], G.798[ITU T G.798], G.874[ITU T G.874], and G.874.1 [ITU T G.874.1].
This section specifies how the MIB II interfaces group, as defined in RFC 2863 [RFC2863], is used for optical interfaces.
Only the ifGeneralInformationGroup will be supported for the ifTable and the ifStackTable to maintain the relationship between the various layers.
The OTN layers are managed in the ifTable using IfEntries that correlate to the layers depicted in Figure 1.
For example, a DWDM device with an Optical Network Node Interface (ONNI) will have an Optical Transmission Section (OTS) physical layer, an Optical Multiplex Section (OMS) layer (transports multiple optical channels), and an Optical Channel (OCh) layer.
There is a one to one relationship between the OMS and OTS layers.
The OMS layer has fixed connectivity via the OTS and thus no connectivity flexibility at the OMS layer is supported.
A device with an ONNI that does not multiplex would consist of the OTS and OCh layers supporting a single channel.
MIB II (RFC 1213) [RFC1213], as amended and extended by RFC 3418 [RFC3418], RFC 2863 [RFC2863], and RFC 2864 [RFC2864], accommodates these cases through appropriate use of the system and interfaces groups.
The system group names and describes the type of managed resource.
The interfaces group defines which OTN layers exist and how these layers are configured and multiplexed.
This is achieved by proper representation of OTN Layers as IfEntries as defined in RFC 2863
In the following figures, opticalChannel and opticalTransport are abbreviated as och and otn respectively.
Since the OMSn and OTSn layers have a one to one relationship, only one otn IfEntry is required to support these two layers.
Therefore, each opticalChannel IfEntry may be mapped to m opticalTransport IfEntries, where m is greater than or equal to 1.
Conversely, each opticalTransport entry may be mapped to n opticalChannel IfEntries, where n is greater than or equal to 1.
There are implementations that have banded amplifers that operate on a group of optical channels separately (e.g., C and L band channels) before finally muxing them together and transporting them over a physical layer.
For such DWDM system implementations, it is important to have the ability to model each of the groups (or bands) with an ifIndex and measure the pre OTN PM parameters for each band separately.
The OTN layering, as described in Figure 1, can be extended to accomodate such implementations by introducing another layer called the OChGroup Layer.
As an example, Figure 2 depicts the OTN layering of a DWDM system with 80 C band and 80 L band channels combined into their respective channel band groups before being muxed into the OMS and transported over the OTS.

OTN Layers for a Banded Configuration
If an implementation does not wish to model the banded configuration, the OChGroup layer is absent and the OTN layering model degenerates to the description in Figure 1.
In other words, when there is an amplifier that covers the whole band, the optIfOMSn objects should be used, rather than using the optIfOChGroup objects with a degenerate group that covers all channels.
The design of the Optical Interface MIB provides the option to model an interface either as a single bidirectional object containing both sink and source functions or as a pair of unidirectional objects, one containing sink functions and the other containing source functions.
If the sink and source for a given protocol layer are to be modelled as separate objects, then there need to be two ifTable entries, one that corresponds to the sink and one that corresponds to the source, where the directionality information is provided in the configuration tables for that layer via the xxxDirectionality objects.
The agent is expected to maintain consistent directionality values between ifStackTable layers (e.g., a sink must not be stacked in a 1:1 manner on top of a source, or vice versa), and all protocol layers that are represented by a given ifTable entry are expected to have the same directionality (i.e., instances of optIfOTSnDirectionality and optIfOMSnDirectionality that correspond to a given ifIndex value must have the same value, and instances of optIfOChDirectionality, optIfOTUkDirectionality, and optIfODUkDirectionality that correspond to a given ifIndex value must have the same value).
When separate ifTable entries are used for the source and sink functions of a given physical interface, association between the two uni directional ifTable entries (one for the source function and the other for the sink functions) should be provided.
It is recommended that identical ifName values are used for the two ifTable entries to indicate such association.
An implementation shall explicitly state what mechanism is used to indicate the association, if ifName is not used.
Example 1: Management of unterminated opticalChannel (och) using passive optics
An OTN device connected with two adjacent nodes in a single fiber ring that supports 10 wavelengths per fiber would have 2 opticalTransport IfEntries and 20 opticalChannel IfEntries, as depicted in Figure 3.
Thus 10 opticalChannel IfEntries are stacked above the first opticalTransport IfEntry, and the other 10 opticalChannel IfEntries are stacked above the second opticalTransport IfEntry.
Note that the optical channels in this example are un terminated, and thus no OTUk objects will be instantiated for these optical channels.
The opticalChannel IfEntries of one otn may be dropped/added from/to the OTN device or cross connected with the opticalChannel IfEntries of the other otn.
Cross connection from a member of the first 10 opticalChannel IfEntries to a member of the second 10 opticalChannel IfEntries could be modelled by using a cross  connect object, which is not yet defined in this version of the MIB.
Interface stacks when channels are unterminated Example 2:
Management of terminated opticalChannel (och) interfaces An OTN device connected with two adjacent nodes in a single fiber ring that supports 10 wavelengths per fiber would have 2 opticalTransport IfEntries and 20 opticalChannel IfEntries, as depicted in Figure 4.
Thus 10 opticalChannel IfEntries are stacked above the first opticalTransport IfEntry, and the other 10 opticalChannel IfEntries are stacked above the second opticalTransport IfEntry.
As the optical channels in this example are terminated, OTUk objects and possibly ODUk objects will be instantiated for the terminated opticalChannel IfEntries.
Interface stacks when channels are terminated Note that the two examples described above depict the interface stacks when the banded configuration is not modeled.
The exact configuration and multiplexing of the layers is maintained in the ifStackTable (RFC 2863)
and in the ifInvStackTable (RFC 2864) [RFC2864];  see section 2.5 for details.

Use of ifStackTable Use of the ifStackTable and ifInvStackTable to associate the opticalTransport and opticalChannel interface entries is best illustrated by the example shown in Figure 5.
The example assumes an otn interface with ifIndex i that carries two multiplexed och interfaces with ifIndex values of j and k, respectively.
The example shows that j and k are stacked above (i.e., multiplexed into)
i. Furthermore, it shows that there is no layer lower than i and no layer higher than j and/or k. HigherLayer
Use of ifStackTable for an OTN port Figure 6 illustrates an example for a banded configuration.
The example assumes an otn interface with ifIndex i that carries two multiplexed och groups with ifIndex values u and v.  An och group with ifIndex value u combines two och interfaces with ifIndex values of a and b.
An och group with ifIndex value v combines two och interfaces with ifIndex values of c and d.
The example show that a and b are stacked above (i.e., multiplexed into) u.
Likewise, c and d are stacked above v.  u and v are multiplexed into i.
Furthermore, it shows that there is no layer lower than i and no layer higher than a, b, c,
It also shows that u has a and b as its higher layers, and v has c and d as its higher layers.
Use of ifStackTable for an OTN port for a banded configuration For the inverse stack table, it provides the same information as the interface stack table, with the order of the Higher and Lower layer interfaces reversed.

The OTM is the information structure that is transported across an ONNI.
The index n and m define the number of supported wavelengths and bit rates at the interface.
Two OTM structures are defined: OTM with full functionality (OTM n.m) and OTM with reduced functionality (OTM 0.m & OTM  nr.m).
The OTM n.m consists of up to n multiplexed optical channels and an OTM overhead signal to support the non associated overhead.

The following Defect conditions are defined in G.798 (as fault cause) for OTN monitoring.
The relationship of these conditions within a network layer and between layers are described in G.798 [ITU T G.798].
To facilitate identification of equipment and facilities that may require maintenance, it is necessary to monitor parameters such as optical power at each layer.
The measurements are taken periodically, and a snapshot of the current value is also made available.
More specifically, performance parameters at each layer are maintained for the current 15 minute interval, the current 24  hour interval, N previous 15 minute intervals where 4 <  N <  96, and one previous 24 hour interval.
Note that some of the previous interval data will be unavailable if the agent has restarted within the last 24 hours.
There is no requirement for an agent to ensure a fixed relationship between the start of a 15 minute or 24 hour interval and any wall clock;  however, some agents may align the 15 minute intervals with quarter hours and may align the 24 hour intervals with a particular hour of the day (e.g., 00:00 UTC).
Note that some DWDM systems may also monitor the laser temperature of the equipment in addition to monitoring the optical power.
However, industry opinions vary widely with respect to laser temperature monitoring, in particular regarding the benefit of the monitoring and which temperatures are to be monitored (i.e., all or only some of the pump lasers).
Similarly, there are varying opinions regarding mid  stage power monitoring.
Since no consensus was reached, it was decided that the laser temperature monitoring and mid stage monitoring would not be standardized in the MIB.
If an implementation would like to monitor these parameters, one could use a proprietary MIB or the ENTITY SENSOR
The sink side monitoring points for the various layers are shown in Figure 7 below.
The source side monitoring points for the various layers are shown in Figure 8 below.
Source side pre OTN monitoring points Note that optical performance parameters are of type Integer32, rather than Counter32 or Gauge32, because it is possible for these objects to increase or decrease and to assume negative or positive values.
An ODUk termination can be provisioned to support (0..6) TCM levels.
Each TCM field contains the following subfields:  Trail Trace Identifier (TTI)
Bit Interleaved Parity 8 (BIP8)
Backward Defect Indication (BDI)  Backward Error Indication (BEI)
Status bits indicating the presence of TCM overhead, Incoming AlignmentError, or a maintenance signal (STAT).
The insertion of these subfields is controlled by:  optIfODUkTSourceMode or otnODUkTsinkMode
The detection and corresponding action of these subfields are controlled by:  optIfODUkTTimDetMode
The TCM connection is used for monitoring the quality of an end to end connection or any segment, as illustrated in the example: TCM1 used for the end to end connection from A1 to A2.
TCM2 used for segment B1 B2, then used again for segment B3 B4.
these bytes are not in used in this example.
The TCM connection can be nested (B1 B2 is nested in A1 A2) or cascaded (B1 B2 and B3 B4).

"This object indicates whether a reduced or full functionality is supported at the interface.
A value of true means reduced.
A value of false means full."
This attribute is a bit map representing the bit rate or set of bit rates supported on the interface.
The meaning of each bit position is as follows:
bitRateK1(0) is set if the 2.5 Gbit/s rate is supported bitRateK2(1) is set if the 10 Gbit/s rate is supported bitRateK3(2) is set if the 40 Gbit/s rate is supported Note that each bit position corresponds to one possible value of the type OptIfBitRateK.

"This object identifies the type of interface.
The value of this attribute will affect the behavior of the OTM with respect to presence/absence of OTM Overhead Signal (OOS) processing and TCM activation.
For an IrDI interface, there is no OOS processing and TCM activation is limited to n levels as specified by a TCM level threshold.
This object contains two fields that are separated by whitespace.
The possible values are: field 1: one of the 4 character ASCII strings 'IrDI' or 'IaDI' field 2: free form text consisting of printable UTF 8 encoded characters Note that field 2 is optional.
If it is not present then there is no requirement for trailing whitespace after field 1.
The default values are as follows:
field 1:  'IaDI' field 2: an empty string."
"This object identifies the maximum number of TCM levels allowed for any Optical Channel contained in this OTM.
A new TCM activation will be rejected if the requested level is greater than the threshold.
If InterfaceType object specifies a type of 'IaDI' for this OTM, then this attribute is irrelevant.

There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB module with a MAX ACCESS clause of read write and/or read create.
It is possible for writes to these objects to have disruptive effects on network operation that range from invalid performance data to traffic interruptions.
Users of this MIB module must therefore be aware that support for SET operations in a non secure environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on network operations.
The most sensitive objects are the read write and read create objects listed in the optIfOtnConfigCompl compliance statement that control the maximum number of TCM levels allowed (optIfOTMnTcmMax), automatic power reduction (optIfOTSnAprControl), transmitted trail trace (optIfOTSnTraceIdentifierTransmitted, optIfOTUkTraceIdentifierTransmitted, optIfODUkTtpTraceIdentifierTransmitted, optIfODUkTTraceIdentifierTransmitted), expected source/destination access point identifiers (optIfOTSnDAPIExpected, optIfOTSnSAPIExpected, optIfOTUkDAPIExpected, optIfOTUkSAPIExpected, optIfODUkTtpDAPIExpected, optIfODUkTtpSAPIExpected, optIfODUkNimDAPIExpected, optIfODUkNimSAPIExpected, optIfODUkTDAPIExpected, optIfODUkTSAPIExpected, optIfODUkTNimDAPIExpected, optIfODUkTNimSAPIExpected), trace identifier mismatch detection mode (optIfOTSnTIMDetMode, optIfOTUkTIMDetMode, optIfODUkTtpTIMDetMode, optIfODUkNimTIMDetMode, optIfODUkTTIMDetMode, optIfODUkTNimTIMDetMode), trace identifier mismatch consequent action (optIfOTSnTIMActEnabled, optIfOTUkTIMActEnabled, optIfODUkTtpTIMActEnabled, optIfODUkNimTIMActEnabled, optIfODUkTTIMActEnabled, optIfODUkTNimTIMActEnabled), threshold level for declaring a PM Second to be bad (optIfOTUkDEGThr, optIfODUkTtpDEGThr, optIfODUkNimDEGThr, optIfODUkTDEGThr, optIfODUkTNimDEGThr), threshold level for declaring a Degraded Signal defect (optIfOTUkDEGM, optIfODUkTtpDEGM, optIfODUkNimDEGM, optIfODUkTDEGM, optIfODUkTNimDEGM), whether the sink/source adaptation function is activated (optIfOTUkSinkAdaptActive, optIfOTUkSourceAdaptActive), whether Forward Error Correction is supported (optIfOTUkSinkFECEnabled), the application transported by the GCC entities (optIfGCC0Application, optIfGCC12Application), creating and deleting a conceptual row of a config table (optIfGCC0RowStatus, optIfODUkNimRowStatus, optIfGCC12RowStatus, optIfODUkTRowStatus, optIfODUkTNimRowStatus), whether the selected GCC overhead bytes are passed through or modified (optIfGCC12GCCPassThrough), TCM mode (optIfODUkTSinkMode), and provisioning of the sink/source LOCK signal (optIfODUkTSinkLockSignalAdminState, optIfODUkTSourceLockSignalAdminState), as these may cause traffic interruptions if improperly set.
The readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., the objects with a MAX ACCESS other than not accessible) may be considered sensitive in some environments since, collectively, they provide information about the performance of interfaces in OTN equipment or networks and can reveal aspects of their configuration.
In such environments it is important to control even GET and NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly to encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over the network via SNMP.
SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec), there is no control as to who on the secure network is allowed to access and
GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) objects in this MIB module.
It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8), including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for authentication and privacy).
Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT RECOMMENDED.
Instead, it is RECOMMENDED that SNMPv3 be deployed and cryptographic security be enabled.
It is then a customer/operator responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate rights to indeed GET or SET
