  - "Introduction\n   A networked application is a realization of some well-defined\
    \ service\n   on one or more host computers that is accessible via some network,\n\
    \   uses some network for its internal operations, or both.\n   There are a wide\
    \ range of networked applications for which it is\n   appropriate to provide SNMP\
    \ monitoring of their network usage.  This\n   includes applications using both\
    \ TCP/IP and OSI networking.  This\n   document defines a MIB which contains the\
    \ elements common to the\n   monitoring of any network service application.  This\
    \ information\n   includes a table of all monitorable network service applications,\
    \ a\n   count of the associations (connections) to each application, and\n   basic\
    \ information about the parameters and status of each\n   application-related\
    \ association.\n   This MIB may be used on its own for any application, and for\
    \ most\n   simple applications this will suffice.  This MIB is also designed to\n\
    \   serve as a building block which can be used in conjunction with\n   application-specific\
    \ monitoring and management.  Two examples of this\n   are MIBs defining additional\
    \ variables for monitoring a Message\n   Transfer Agent (MTA) service or a Directory\
    \ Service Agent (DSA)\n   service. It is expected that further MIBs of this nature\
    \ will be\n   specified.\n   This MIB does not attempt to provide facilities for\
    \ management of the\n   host or hosts the network service application runs on,\
    \ nor does it\n   provide facilities for monitoring applications that provide\
    \ something\n   other than a network service.  Host resource and general application\n\
    \   monitoring is handled by either the Host Resources MIB [1] or the\n   application\
    \ MIB [2].\n"

- title: 1.  The SNMP Network Management Framework
  contents:
  - "1.  The SNMP Network Management Framework\n   The SNMP Management Framework presently\
    \ consists of five major\n   components:\n   o   An overall architecture, described\
    \ in RFC 2571 [3].\n   o   Mechanisms for describing and naming objects and events\
    \ for the\n       purpose of management. The first version of this Structure of\n\
    \       Management Information (SMI) is called SMIv1 and described in STD\n  \
    \     16, RFC 1155 [4], STD 16, RFC 1212 [5] and RFC 1215 [6]. The\n       second\
    \ version, called SMIv2, is described in STD 58, RFC 2578\n       [7], STD 58,\
    \ RFC 2579 [8] and STD 58, RFC 2580 [9].\n   o   Message protocols for transferring\
    \ management information. The\n       first version of the SNMP message protocol\
    \ is called SNMPv1 and\n       described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [10]. A second version\
    \ of the SNMP\n       message protocol, which is not an Internet standards track\n\
    \       protocol, is called SNMPv2c and described in RFC 1901 [11] and\n     \
    \  RFC 1906 [12].  The third version of the message protocol is\n       called\
    \ SNMPv3 and described in RFC 1906 [12], RFC 2572 [13] and\n       RFC 2574 [14].\n\
    \   o   Protocol operations for accessing management information. The\n      \
    \ first set of protocol operations and associated PDU formats is\n       described\
    \ in STD 15, RFC 1157 [10]. A second set of protocol\n       operations and associated\
    \ PDU formats is described in RFC 1905\n       [15].\n   o   A set of fundamental\
    \ applications described in RFC 2573 [16] and\n       the view-based access control\
    \ mechanism described in RFC 2575\n       [17].\n   Managed objects are accessed\
    \ via a virtual information store, termed\n   the Management Information Base\
    \ or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are\n   defined using the mechanisms defined in\
    \ the SMI.\n   This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2.\
    \ A\n   MIB conforming to the SMIv1 can be produced through the appropriate\n\
    \   translations. The resulting translated MIB must be semantically\n   equivalent,\
    \ except where objects or events are omitted because no\n   translation is possible\
    \ (use of Counter64). Some machine readable\n   information in SMIv2 will be converted\
    \ into textual descriptions in\n   SMIv1 during the translation process. However,\
    \ this loss of machine\n   readable information is not considered to change the\
    \ semantics of the\n   MIB.\n"
- title: 2.  Rationale for having a Network Services Monitoring MIB
  contents:
  - "2.  Rationale for having a Network Services Monitoring MIB\n   Much effort has\
    \ been expended in developing tools to manage lower\n   layer network facilities.\
    \  However, relatively little work has been\n   done on managing application layer\
    \ entities.  It is neither efficient\n   nor reasonable to manage all aspects\
    \ of application layer entities\n   using only lower layer information. Moreover,\
    \ the difficulty of\n   managing application entities in this way increases dramatically\
    \ as\n   application entities become more complex.\n   This leads to a substantial\
    \ need to monitor applications which\n   provide network services, particularly\
    \ distributed components such as\n   MTAs and DSAs, by monitoring specific aspects\
    \ of the application\n   itself.  Reasons to monitor such components include but\
    \ are not\n   limited to measuring load, detecting broken connectivity, isolating\n\
    \   system failures, and locating congestion.\n   In order to manage network service\
    \ applications effectively two\n   requirements must be met:\n   (1) It must be\
    \ possible to monitor a large number of components\n       (typical for a large\
    \ organization).\n   (2) Application monitoring must be integrated into general\
    \ network\n       management.\n   This specification defines simple read-only\
    \ access; this is\n   sufficient to determine up/down status and provide an indication\
    \ of a\n   broad class of operational problems.\n"
- title: 2.1.  General Relationship to Other MIBs
  contents:
  - "2.1.  General Relationship to Other MIBs\n   This MIB is intended to only provide\
    \ facilities common to the\n   monitoring of any network service application.\
    \  It does not provide\n   all the facilities necessary to monitor any specific\
    \ application.\n   Each specific type of network service application is expected\
    \ to have\n   a MIB of its own that makes use of these common facilities.\n"
- title: 2.2.  Restriction of Scope
  contents:
  - "2.2.  Restriction of Scope\n   The framework provided here is very minimal; there\
    \ is a lot more that\n   could be done. For example:\n   (1) General network service\
    \ application configuration monitoring and\n       control.\n   (2) Detailed examination\
    \ and modification of individual entries in\n       service-specific request queues.\n\
    \   (3) Probing to determine the status of a specific request (e.g., the\n   \
    \    location of a mail message with a specific message-id).\n   (4) Requesting\
    \ that certain actions be performed (e.g., forcing an\n       immediate connection\
    \ and transfer of pending messages to some\n       specific system).\n   All these\
    \ capabilities are both impressive and useful.  However,\n   these capabilities\
    \ would require provisions for strict security\n   checking.  These capabilities\
    \ would also mandate a much more complex\n   design, with many characteristics\
    \ likely to be fairly\n   implementation-specific.  As a result such facilities\
    \ are likely to\n   be both contentious and difficult to implement.\n   This document\
    \ religiously keeps things simple and focuses on the\n   basic monitoring aspect\
    \ of managing applications providing network\n   services.  The goal here is to\
    \ provide a framework which is simple,\n   useful, and widely implementable.\n"
- title: 2.3.  Configuration Information
  contents:
  - "2.3.  Configuration Information\n   This MIB attempts to provide information\
    \ about the operational\n   aspects of an application. Further information about\
    \ the actual\n   configuration of a given application may be kept in other places;\
    \ the\n   applDirectoryName or applURL may be used to point to places where\n\
    \   such information is kept.\n"
- title: 3.  Application Objects
  contents:
  - "3.  Application Objects\n   This MIB defines a set of general purpose attributes\
    \ which would be\n   appropriate for a range of applications that provide network\n\
    \   services.  Both OSI and non-OSI services can be accommodated.\n   Additional\
    \ tables defined in extensions to this MIB provide\n   attributes specific to\
    \ specific network services.\n   A table is defined which will have one row for\
    \ each operational\n   network service application on the system.  The only static\n\
    \   information held on the application is its name.  All other static\n   information\
    \ should be obtained from various directory services.  The\n   applDirectoryName\
    \ is an external key, which allows an SNMP MIB entry\n   to be cleanly related\
    \ to the X.500 Directory.  In SNMP terms, the\n   applications are grouped in\
    \ a table called applTable, which is\n   indexed by an integer key applIndex.\n\
    \   The type of the application will be determined by one or both of:\n    (1)\
    \   Additional MIB variables specific to the applications.\n    (2)   An association\
    \ to the application of a specific protocol.\n"

  - "8.  Security Considerations\n   There are no management objects defined in this\
    \ MIB that have a MAX-\n   ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  So,\
    \ if this MIB is\n   implemented correctly, then there is no risk that an intruder\
    \ can\n   alter or create any management objects of this MIB via direct SNMP\n\
    \   SET operations.\n   However, this MIB does provide passive information about\
    \ the\n   existence, type, and configuration of applications on a given host\n\
    \   that could potentially indicate some sort of vulnerability. Finally,\n   the\
    \ information MIB provides about network usage could be used to\n   analyze network\
    \ traffic patterns.\n   SNMPv1 by itself is not a secure environment.  Even if\
    \ the network\n   itself is secure (for example by using IPSec), even then, there\
    \ is no\n   control as to who on the secure network is allowed to access and\n\
    \   GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects in this MIB.\n   It is recommended\
    \ that the implementers consider the security\n   features as provided by the\
    \ SNMPv3 framework.  Specifically, the use\n   of the User-based Security Model\
    \ RFC 2574 [14] and the View-based\n   Access Control Model RFC 2575 [17] is recommended.\n\
    \   It is then a customer/user responsibility to ensure that the SNMP\n   entity\
    \ giving access to an instance of this MIB, is properly\n   configured to give\
    \ access to the objects only to those principals\n   (users) that have legitimate\
    \ rights to indeed GET or SET\n   (change/create/delete) them.\n"
