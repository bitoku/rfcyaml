  contents:
  - "1. The attachOverride Option\n   Section 5.1 contains the APEX option registration\
    \ for the\n   \"attachOverride\" option.\n   The default behavior of the APEX\
    \ relaying mesh, in the absence of\n   processing options, is to allow at most\
    \ one application to attach as\n   a particular endpoint, on a \"first come, first\
    \ served\" basis.  The\n   \"attachOverride\" option provides gives preference\
    \ to the current\n   application trying to attach.\n   If this option is present\
    \ in the \"attach\" operation (c.f., Section\n   4.4.1 of [1]) and if any application\
    \ is already attached as the\n   specified endpoint, that endpoint has its attachment\
    \ terminated\n   (c.f., Section 4.4.3 of [1]) concurrently with processing of\
    \ that\n   \"attach\" operation.  The \"code\" attribute of the resulting\n  \
    \ \"terminate\" operation is set to 556.\n   Note that any data being expected\
    \ by the previously-attached\n   application may instead be delivered to the last\
    \ application to\n   successfully attach.  Accordingly, applications should take\
    \ care to\n   properly deal with incoming data having unrecognized transaction-\n\
    \   identifiers (c.f., Section 6.1.1 of [1]).\n   This option provides for a new\
    \ attachment to automatically terminate\n   any existing attachment for the same\
    \ endpoint.  For example, this\n   might be helpful when a new attachment is required\
    \ from a different\n   device while a previously-used device is still attached\
    \ e.g.,\n        +-------+                  +-------+\n        |       | -- attach\

- title: 2. The dataTiming Option
  contents:
  - "2. The dataTiming Option\n   Section 5.2 contains the APEX option registration\
    \ for the\n   \"dataTiming\" option.  This option contains a \"dataTiming\" element\n\
    \   (c.f., Section 6).\n   The default behavior of the APEX relaying mesh is \"\
    immediate, best\n   effort\", and expects that all relays and endpoints are able\
    \ to\n   process and transfer data without delay -- in the absence of\n   processing\
    \ options, if a relay is unavailable, then data is silently\n   dropped.  The\
    \ \"dataTiming\" option provides for controlled queuing\n   delays in processing,\
    \ whilst providing reasonable deterministic\n   behavior for the originator.\n\
    \   There are two types of delays addressed by the \"dataTiming\" option:\n  \
    \ o  delays in transit through the relaying mesh, possibly due to\n      intermittent\
    \ or slow connections, or congested relays; and,\n   o  delays because the intended\
    \ endpoint is not available to receive\n      the data, when used in conjunction\
    \ with the hold4Endpoint option\n      (Section 3).\n   Accordingly, the \"dataTiming\"\
    \ option allows for:\n   o  data to be discarded if not delivered within a finite\
    \ amount of\n      time as specified using the \"noLaterThan\" attribute (Section\
    \ 2.1);\n   o  a \"statusResponse\" message (c.f., Section 5.1 of [1]) to be\n\
    \      generated if data is not delivered within a known amount of time\n    \
    \  as specified using the \"reportAfter\" attribute (Section 2.2); and,\n   o\
    \  an upper limit on the amount of time for the \"statusResponse\"\n      message\
    \ to be delivered using the \"returnTrip\" attribute (Section\n      2.1.1), after\
    \ which the sender may presume the message to be lost.\n   This option does not\
    \ provide any functionality with respect to the\n   priority of the data.  Nor\
    \ does this option have any effect on other\n   parts of the relaying process.\n\
    \   Further, note that because this option is processed on a per-hop\n   basis,\
    \ the originator must set the \"targetHop\" attribute to the value\n   \"all\"\
    \ and the \"mustUnderstand\" attribute to the value \"true\".\n"
- title: 2.1 Upper-Bounds on Delivery
  contents:
  - "2.1 Upper-Bounds on Delivery\n   The \"noLaterThan\" attribute of the \"dataTiming\"\
    \ option provides for\n   control over delays that may occur in transit through\
    \ the relaying\n   mesh or to the recipient endpoint.\n   If this option is present\
    \ in the \"data\" operation (c.f., Section\n   4.4.4 of [1]) and the value of\
    \ the \"noLaterThan\" attribute is non-\n   zero, then:\n   o  For Step 5.2 of\
    \ Section 4.4.4.1 of [1]:\n      Immediately prior to sending the data to the\
    \ next relay, the value\n      of the \"noLaterThan\" attribute is adjusted to\
    \ reflect the\n      processing time of the data at the local relay (e.g., the\
    \ time\n      required to determine the next relay, to successfully issue a\n\
    \      \"bind\" operation, and then be ready to immediately issue a \"data\"\n\
    \      operation).\n      If the value of the \"noLaterThan\" attribute becomes\
    \ less than or\n      equal to zero, an error in processing has occurred, the\
    \ data\n      element is not sent to the next relay, and if the \"reportErrors\"\
    \n      attribute is true, the APEX report service is invoked to send a\n    \
    \  timing error report.\n   o  For Step 5.3 of Section 4.4.4.1 of [1]:\n     \
    \ If the relay does not receive an \"ok\" element from the recipient\n      endpoint\
    \ within the number of milli-seconds indicated by the value\n      of the \"noLaterThan\"\
    \ attribute, an error in processing has\n      occurred, and if the \"reportErrors\"\
    \ attribute is true, the APEX\n      report service is invoked to send a timing\
    \ error report.\n      Otherwise, if the data is successfully transmitted to the\n\
    \      recipient, and the \"returnTrip\" attribute is non-zero, the APEX\n   \
    \   report service is invoked to send a final hop report.\n   Note that in some\
    \ cases, a relay may be able to predict this outcome\n   without actually connecting\
    \ to the next relay; if so, a timing error\n   report may be sent without connecting\
    \ to the next relay.\n"

  contents:
  - "3. The hold4Endpoint Option\n   Section 5.3 contains the APEX option registration\
    \ for the\n   \"hold4Endpoint\" option.\n   The default behavior of the APEX relaying\
    \ mesh, in the absence of\n   processing options, is to silently drop data for\
    \ a recipient if its\n   endpoint isn't attached.  The \"hold4Endpoint\" option\
    \ provides for\n   data to be queued if the recipient endpoint is not attached.\n\
    \   If this option is present in the \"data\" operation (c.f., Section\n   4.4.4\
    \ of [1]), and the value of the \"hold4Endpoint\" attribute is true\n   then:\n\
    \   o  For Step 5.3 of Section 4.4.4.1 of [1]:\n      If the recipient's endpoint\
    \ is not currently attached, the relay\n      will queue the data waiting for\
    \ an application to attach as that\n      endpoint.\n   Note that in the absence\
    \ of an upper-bounds on delivery, such as\n   limits provided by the dataTiming\
    \ option (Section 2), the data will\n   be queued indefinitely for the endpoint.\n\

- title: 4. The dataHopping Option
  contents:
  - "4. The dataHopping Option\n   To detect misconfigurations that cause forwarding\
    \ loops in the APEX\n   relaying mesh, the APEX pubsub service re-introduces a\
    \ mechanism\n   similar to the IP TTL [2] mechanism, in the form of an APEX option.\n\
    \   Section 5.4 contains the APEX option registration for the\n   \"dataHopping\"\
    \ option.\n   If this option is present in the \"data\" operation (c.f., Section\n\
    \   4.4.4 of [1]) and the value of the \"noMoreThan\" attribute is non-\n   zero,\
    \ then:\n   o  For Step 5.2 of Section 4.4.4.1 of [1]:\n      Immediately prior\
    \ to sending the data to the next relay, the value\n      of the \"noMoreThan\"\
    \ attribute is reduced by 1.\n      If the value of the \"noMoreThan\" attribute\
    \ becomes less than or\n      equal to zero, an error in processing has occurred,\
    \ the data\n      element is not sent to the next relay, and if the \"reportErrors\"\
    \n      attribute is true, the APEX report service is invoked to send an\n   \
    \   error report.\n   Further, note that because this option is processed on a\
    \ per-hop\n   basis, the originator must set the \"targetHop\" attribute to the\
    \ value\n   \"all\" and the \"mustUnderstand\" attribute to the value \"true\"\
    .\n   If the APEX report service (c.f., Section 6.2 of [1]) is invoked to\n  \
    \ send an error report, it issues a data operation with:\n   o  its originator\
    \ identifying the report service associated with the\n      issuing relay\n  \
    \ o  its recipient identifying the endpoint address of the originator\n      associated\
    \ with the \"dataHopping\" option\n   o  its content consisting of a \"statusResponse\"\
    \ element having:\n      *  its \"transID\" attribute equal to the \"transID\"\
    \ attribute of the\n         \"dataHopping\" option\n      *  and identifying\
