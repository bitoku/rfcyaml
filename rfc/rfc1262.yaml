  - "Summary\n   Measurement of the Internet is critical for future development,\n\
    \   evolution and deployment planning.  Internet-wide activities have the\n  \
    \ potential to interfere with normal operation and must be planned with\n   care\
    \ and made widely known beforehand.  This document offers guidance\n   to researchers\
    \ planning Internet measurements.\n   This RFC represents IAB guidance for researchers\
    \ considering\n   measurement experiments on the Internet.  This RFC does not\
    \ represent\n   a standard for the Internet but the Internet Activities Board\n\
    \   strongly urges that Internet users follow the guidelines out of\n   courtesy\
    \ and professional consideration for the Internet community.\n"

  - "Guidelines\n   The Internet has undergone dramatic growth in connectivity, use,\
    \ and\n   quality of service over the past several years.  As this growth\n  \
    \ continues and the Internet is used for increasingly diverse and\n   demanding\
    \ purposes, it is vital to collect data about a range of\n   functions, from low-level\
    \ packet switching services to considerations\n   for the networking expectations\
    \ of individual applications.  Such\n   data is vital to research and engineering\
    \ planning activities, as\n   well as to ensure the continued development of the\
    \ operational\n   infrastructure.  Yet, it is also important that data collection\n\
    \   activities do not interfere with the operational viability and\n   stability\
    \ of the network, and do not violate considerations regarding\n   privacy, security,\
    \ and acceptable use policies of the network.  In\n   this light, the Internet\
    \ Activities Board offers the following basic\n   guidelines for network measurement\
    \ activities.\n   In general, any data collection activity should be undertaken\
    \ with\n   professional consideration of its impact on the services and users\
    \ of\n   the network, and activities should be planned to achieve operational\n\
    \   or research goals with minimal impact.  In some cases, data may be\n   collected\
    \ continuously, for example to measure packet counts or the\n   distribution of\
    \ use of specific applications.  In other cases, the\n   planned investigations\
    \ will be too demanding to be undertaken\n   continuously, because of the intensity\
    \ of effort required by the\n   researcher or the traffic load on the underlying\
    \ network\n   infrastructure.  Any data collection activity should be designed\
    \ with\n   careful consideration of this type of issue, and should be tested\n\
    \   thoroughly before being deployed on the Internet.  Any individual\n   initiating\
    \ a network measurement activity should alert the relevant\n   service providers\
    \ using mechanisms such as bulletin boards, mailing\n   lists and individual mail\
    \ communications.\n   Furthermore, the data being collected must not be gathered\
    \ using\n   break-ins to network systems or other illegal or unethical\n   techniques.\
    \  If a measurement activity might be construed as a\n   possible security intrusion,\
    \ the researcher should make it easy for a\n   system administrator at a remote\
    \ site to determine that the activity\n   is not a break in attempt, by informing\
    \ the CERT, making information\n   about the study easily available by anonymous\
    \ FTP or other means\n   [1,2,3].\n   More specifically, an individual attempting\
    \ a network measurement\n   activity should ensure that the following conditions\
    \ are met:\n     1) the data collected will not violate privacy, security, or\n\
    \        acceptable use concerns,\n     2) if the aggregated data has a potential\
    \ for privacy intrusions,\n        the researcher must protect privacy, for example\
    \ by limiting\n        published statistics in such a fashion that individual\
    \ users or\n        institutions are not identified,\n     3) if the data collection\
    \ activity may be construed to be a\n        security violation, the researchers\
    \ are strongly advised to\n        inform the CERT in advance, and, if applicable,\
    \ request some\n        guidance,\n     4) the data collection does not unduly\
    \ load or otherwise interfere\n        with the network or attached machines,\
    \ in particular, if at all\n        feasible, non-invasive measurement, like passive\
    \ monitoring,\n        should be considered as the first choice,\n     5) if there\
    \ is an operational impact, the service providers must be\n        contacted,\n\
    \     6) the study goals, methodology, and plans are widely available, in\n  \
    \      a fashion that requires minimal effort to locate and retrieve,\n      \
    \  and\n     7) if the activity would impose undue burden on a remote machine\
    \ or\n        network, the measurements should not be performed without prior\n\
    \        explicit permission.\n"
