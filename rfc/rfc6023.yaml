- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   IKEv2, as specified in [RFC5996], requires that the IKE_AUTH\
    \ exchange\n   try to create a Child SA along with the IKEv2 SA.  This requirement\n\
    \   is sometimes inconvenient or superfluous, as some implementations\n   need\
    \ to use IKEv2 for authentication only, while others would like to\n   set up\
    \ the IKEv2 SA before there is any actual traffic to protect.\n   The extension\
    \ described in this document allows the creation of an\n   IKEv2 SA without also\
    \ attempting to create a Child SA.  The terms\n   IKEv2, IKEv2 SA, and Child SA\
    \ and the various IKEv2 exchanges are\n   defined in [RFC5996]\n   An IKEv2 SA\
    \ without any Child SA is not a fruitless endeavor.  Even\n   without Child SAs,\
    \ an IKEv2 SA allows:\n   o  Checking the liveness status of the peer via liveness\
    \ checks.\n   o  Quickly setting up Child SAs without public key operations and\n\
    \      without user interaction.\n   o  Authentication of the peer.\n   o  Detection\
    \ of NAT boxes between two hosts on the Internet.\n"

- title: 2.  Usage Scenarios
  contents:
  - "2.  Usage Scenarios\n   Several scenarios motivated this proposal:\n   o  Interactive\
    \ remote access VPN: the user tells the client to\n      \"connect\", which may\
    \ involve interactive authentication.  There is\n      still no traffic, but some\
    \ may come later.  Since there is no\n      traffic, it is impossible for the\
    \ gateway to know what selectors\n      to use (how to narrow down the client's\
    \ proposal).\n   o  Location-aware security, as in [SecureBeacon].  The user is\n\
    \      roaming between trusted and untrusted networks.  While in an\n      untrusted\
    \ network, all traffic should be encrypted, but on the\n      trusted network,\
    \ only the IKEv2 SA needs to be maintained.\n   o  An IKEv2 SA may be needed between\
    \ peers even when there is not\n      IPsec traffic.  Such IKEv2 peers use liveness\
    \ checks, and report\n      to the administrator the status of the \"VPN links\"\
    .\n   o  IKEv2 may be used on some physically secure links, where\n      authentication\
    \ is necessary but traffic protection is not.  An\n      example of this is the\
    \ Passive Optical Network (PON) links as\n      described in [3GPP.33.820].\n\
    \   o  Childless IKEv2 can be used for [RFC5106] where we use IKEv2 as a\n   \
    \   method for user authentication.\n   o  A node receiving IPsec traffic with\
    \ an unrecognized Security\n      Parameter Index (SPI) should send an INVALID_SPI\
    \ notification.  If\n      this traffic comes from a peer, which it recognizes\
    \ based on its\n      IP address, then this node may set up an IKEv2 SA so as\
    \ to be able\n      to send the notification in a protected INFORMATIONAL exchange.\n\
    \   o  A future extension may have IKEv2 SAs used for generating keying\n    \
    \  material for applications, without ever requiring Child SAs.  This\n      is\
    \ similar to what [RFC5705] is doing in Transport Layer Security\n      (TLS).\n\
    \   In some of these cases, it may be possible to create a dummy Child SA\n  \
    \ and then remove it, but this creates undesirable side effects and\n   race conditions.\
    \  Moreover, the IKEv2 peer might see the deletion of\n   the Child SA as a reason\
    \ to delete the IKEv2 SA.\n"
- title: 3.  Protocol Outline
  contents:
  - "3.  Protocol Outline\n   The decision of whether or not to support an IKE_AUTH\
    \ exchange\n   without the piggy-backed Child SA negotiation is ultimately up\
    \ to the\n   responder.  A supporting responder MUST include the Notify payload,\n\
    \   described in Section 4, within the IKE_SA_INIT response.\n   A supporting\
    \ initiator MAY send the modified IKE_AUTH request,\n   described in Section 5,\
    \ if the notification was included in the\n   IKE_SA_INIT response.  The initiator\
    \ MUST NOT send the modified\n   IKE_AUTH request if the notification was not\
    \ present.\n   A supporting responder that has advertised support by including\
    \ the\n   notification in the IKE_SA_INIT response MUST process a modified\n \
    \  IKE_AUTH request, and MUST reply with a modified IKE_AUTH response.\n   Such\
    \ a responder MUST NOT reply with a modified IKE_AUTH response if\n   the initiator\
    \ did not send a modified IKE_AUTH request.\n   A supporting responder that has\
    \ been configured not to support this\n   extension to the protocol MUST behave\
    \ as the same as if it didn't\n   support this extension.  It MUST NOT advertise\
    \ the capability with a\n   notification, and it SHOULD reply with an INVALID_SYNTAX\
    \ Notify\n   payload if the client sends an IKE_AUTH request that is modified\
    \ as\n   described in Section 5.\n"

- title: 6.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "6.  Security Considerations\n   This protocol variation inherits all the security\
    \ properties of\n   regular IKEv2 as described in [RFC5996].\n   The new notification\
    \ carried in the initial exchange advertises the\n   capability, and cannot be\
    \ forged or added by an adversary without\n   being detected, because the response\
    \ to the initial exchange is\n   authenticated with the AUTH payload of the IKE_AUTH\
    \ exchange.\n   Furthermore, both peers have to be configured to use this variation\n\
