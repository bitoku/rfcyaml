    \ defines a\n   notification service that provides updates about a conference\n\
    \   instance's state to authorized parties using a notification protocol,\n  \
    \ as shown in Figure 1.  This document specifies how to use the SIP\n   (Session\
    \ Initiation Protocol [RFC3261]) event package for conference\n   state defined\
    \ in [RFC4575] as a notification protocol between a\n   client and a conference's\

    \ and protocol in the XCON architecture\n   In addition to specifying the SIP\
    \ event package for conference state,\n   [RFC4575] specifies a data format to\
    \ be used with the event package.\n   The XCON data model [RFC6501] extends that\
    \ format with new elements\n   and attributes so that the extended format supports\
    \ more\n   functionality (e.g., floor control).  The notification protocol\n \
    \  specified in this document supports all the data defined in the XCON\n   data\
    \ model (i.e., the data originally defined in [RFC4575] plus all\n   the extensions\
    \ defined in [RFC6501]) plus a partial notification\n   mechanism based on XML\
    \ patch operations [RFC5261].\n"

- title: 3.  Notification Formats
  contents:
  - "3.  Notification Formats\n   In order to obtain notifications from a conference\
    \ server's\n   notification service, a client subscribes to the 'conference' event\n\
    \   package at the server as specified in [RFC4575].  Per [RFC4575],\n   NOTIFY\
    \ requests within this event package can carry an XML document\n   in the \"application/conference-info+xml\"\
    \ format.  Additionally, per\n   this specification, NOTIFY requests can also\
    \ carry XML documents in\n   the \"application/xcon-conference-info+xml\" and\
    \ the \"application/\n   xcon-conference-info-diff+xml\" formats.\n   A document\
    \ in the \"application/xcon-conference-info+xml\" format\n   provides the user\
    \ agent with the whole state of a conference\n   instance.  A document in the\
    \ \"application/\n   xcon-conference-info-diff+xml\" format provides the user\
    \ agent with\n   the changes the state of the conference instance has experienced\n\
    \   since the last notification sent to the user agent.\n"
- title: 4.  Full Notifications
  contents:
  - "4.  Full Notifications\n   Subscribers signal support for full notifications\
    \ by including the\n   \"application/xcon-conference-info+xml\" format in the\
    \ Accept header\n   field of the SUBSCRIBE requests they generate.  If a client\n\
    \   subscribing to the 'conference' event package generates an Accept\n   header\
    \ field that includes the MIME type \"application/\n   xcon-conference-info+xml\"\
    , the server has the option of returning\n   documents that follow the XML format\
    \ specified in [RFC6501] and are\n   carried in \"application/xcon-conference-info+xml\"\
    \ message bodies.\n"
- title: 4.1.  Backwards Compatibility
  contents:
  - "4.1.  Backwards Compatibility\n   Conference servers that implement the SIP event\
    \ package for\n   conference state and support the \"application/\n   xcon-conference-info+xml\"\
    \ MIME type MUST also support the\n   \"application/conference-info+xml\" MIME\
    \ type.  This way, legacy\n   clients, which only support \"application/conference-info+xml\"\
    , are\n   able to receive notifications in a format they understand.\n   Clients\
    \ that implement the SIP event package for conference state and\n   support the\
    \ \"application/xcon-conference-info+xml\" MIME type SHOULD\n   also support the\
    \ \"application/conference-info+xml\" MIME type.  This\n   way, these clients\
    \ are able to receive notifications from legacy\n   servers, which only support\
    \ \"application/conference-info+xml\", in a\n   format they understand.\n"
- title: 5.  Partial Notifications
  contents:
  - "5.  Partial Notifications\n   The conference state reported by this event package\
    \ may contain many\n   elements.  When the \"xcon-conference-info+xml\" format\
    \ is used and\n   there is a change in the state of an element, the server generates\
    \ a\n   notification with the whole conference state.  Generating large\n   notifications\
    \ to report small changes does not meet the efficiency\n   requirements of some\
    \ bandwidth-constrained environments.  The partial\n   notifications mechanism\
    \ specified in this section is a more efficient\n   way to report changes in the\
    \ conference state.\n   The SIP event package for conference state defined a partial\n\
    \   notification mechanism based on <state> elements.  Servers compliant\n   with\
    \ this specification MUST NOT use that partial notification\n   mechanism.  Instead,\
    \ they MUST use the mechanism specified in this\n   section.\n   Subscribers signal\
    \ support for partial notifications by including the\n   \"application/xcon-conference-info-diff+xml\"\
    \ format in the Accept\n   header field of the SUBSCRIBE requests they generate.\
    \  If a client\n   subscribing to the 'conference' event package generates an\
    \ Accept\n   header field that includes the MIME type \"application/\n   xcon-conference-info-diff+xml\"\
    , the server has the option of\n   returning documents that follow the XML format\
    \ specified in\n   Section 5.4 and are carried in \"application/\n   xcon-conference-diff-info+xml\"\
    \ message bodies.\n"
- title: 5.1.  Generation of Partial Notifications
  contents:
  - "5.1.  Generation of Partial Notifications\n   Once a subscription is accepted\
    \ and installed, the server MUST\n   deliver full state in its first notification.\
    \  To report full state,\n   the server MUST set the Content-Type header field\
    \ to the value\n   \"application/xcon-conference-info+xml\".\n   In order to deliver\
    \ a partial notification, the server MUST set the\n   Content-Type header field\
    \ to the value \"application/\n   xcon-conference-info-diff+xml\".  When the server\
    \ generates a partial\n   notification, the server SHOULD only include the information\
    \ that has\n   changed compared to the previous notification.  It is up to the\n\
    \   server's local policy to determine what is considered as a change to\n   the\
    \ previous state.\n   The server MUST construct partial notifications according\
    \ to the\n   following logic: all the information that has been added to the\n\
    \   document is listed inside <add> elements.  All information that has\n   been\
    \ removed from the document is listed inside <remove> elements,\n   and all information\
    \ that has been changed is listed under <replace>\n   elements.\n   The server\
    \ MUST NOT send a new NOTIFY request with a partial\n   notification until it\
    \ has received a final response from the\n   subscriber for the previous one or\
    \ the previous NOTIFY request has\n   timed out.\n   When the server receives\
    \ a SUBSCRIBE request (refresh or termination)\n   within the associated subscription,\
    \ it SHOULD send a NOTIFY request\n   containing the full document using the 'application/\n\
    \   xcon-conference-info+xml' content type.\n   If the server has used a content\
    \ type other than 'application/\n   xcon-conference-info+xml' in notifications\
    \ within the existing\n   subscription and changes to deliver partial notifications,\
    \ the server\n   MUST deliver full state using the 'application/\n   xcon-conference-info+xml'\
    \ content type before generating its first\n   partial notification.\n"
- title: 5.2.  Processing of Partial Notifications
  contents:
  - "5.2.  Processing of Partial Notifications\n   When a subscriber receives the\
    \ first notification containing full\n   state in a 'application/xcon-conference-info+xml'\
    \ MIME body, the\n   subscriber MUST store the received full document as its local\
    \ copy.\n   When the subscriber receives a subsequent notification, the\n   subscriber\
    \ MUST modify its locally stored information according to\n   the following logic:\n\
    \   o  If the notification carries an 'application/\n      xcon-conference-info+xml'\
    \ document, the subscriber MUST replace\n      its local copy of the document\
    \ with the document received in the\n      notification.\n   o  If the notification\
    \ carries an 'application/\n      xcon-conference-info-diff+xml' document, the\
    \ subscriber MUST apply\n      the changes indicated in the received 'application/\n\
    \      xcon-conference-info-diff+xml' document to its local copy of the\n    \
    \  full document.\n   If the subscriber encounters a processing error while processing\
    \ an\n   'application/xcon-conference-info-diff+xml' encoded document, the\n \
    \  subscriber SHOULD renew its subscription.  A subscriber can fall back\n   to\
    \ normal operations by not including the \"application/\n   xcon-conference-info-diff+xml\"\
    \ format in a new SUBSCRIBE request.\n   If the server changes the content type\
    \ used in notifications within\n   the existing subscription, the subscriber MUST\
    \ discard all the\n   previously received information and process the new content\
    \ as\n   specified for that content type.\n"

    \ using the SIP\n   event package for conference state in two new formats.  The\
    \ fact that\n   notifications are encoded in a different format does not have\n\
    \   security implications.  Section 8 of [RFC4575] contains security\n   considerations\
    \ related to the use of the event package.  Implementers\n   of the event package\
    \ need to follow those considerations regardless\n   of the format used to encode\
    \ their notifications.\n"
