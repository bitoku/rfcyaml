- title: Abstract
  contents:
  - "Abstract\n   This memo defines a convention for encapsulating Simple Network\n\
    \   Management Protocol (SNMP) [1] packets over the transport mechanism\n   provided\
    \ via the Internetwork Packet Exchange (IPX) protocol [2].\n"
- title: Editor's Note
  contents:
  - "Editor's Note\n   As stated below and in reference [5], it is strongly advised\
    \ that for\n   interoperability, SNMP be implemented over UDP/IP and not directly\
    \ on\n   media or other protocols (such as IPX).\n"
- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   The SNMP protocol has been specified as the official network\n\
    \   management protocol of the Internet.  Its widespread acceptance and\n   implementation\
    \ by developers, both inside and outside the Internet\n   community, is fostering\
    \ synergetic growth to a variety of protocols\n   and platforms.\n   This memo\
    \ addresses the use of SNMP over the IPX protocol, which has\n   become quite\
    \ widespread principally due to the popularity of Novell\n   NetWare.  Roughly\
    \ equivalent to UDP in function, IPX provides\n   connectionless, unacknowledged\
    \ datagram service over a variety of\n   physical media and protocols.\n   Although\
    \ modifications have been made elsewhere in the NetWare\n   protocol suite, IPX\
    \ is identical to the Xerox Internet Datagram\n   Protocol (IDP) [3].  The socket\
    \ address space authority is\n   administered by Novell.\n   The use of SNMP over\
    \ the UDP transport [4] is today the common mode\n   of operation in the Internet.\
    \ This specification may be appropriate\n   for some environments in which UDP\
    \ transport services are not\n   available.  SNMP implementors should be aware\
    \ that the choice of\n   underlying transport may have a significant impact on\
    \ the\n   interoperability and ubiquity of the management capability in the\n\
    \   Internet.  Considerations relevant to choosing a transport for use\n   with\
    \ SNMP are described in [5].\n"
- title: 2.  Specification
  contents:
  - "2.  Specification\n   SNMP packets will always set the Packet Type field in the\
    \ IPX header\n   to 4 (i.e., Packet Exchange Packet).\n"
- title: 2.1  Socket Assignments
  contents:
  - "2.1  Socket Assignments\n   SNMP protocol entities will receive GetRequest-PDU,\
    \ GetNextRequest-\n   PDU, and SetRequest-PDU messages on socket 36879 (Destination\
    \ Socket\n   field set to hexadecimal 900F), and Trap-PDU messages on socket 36880\n\
    \   (Destination Socket field set to hexadecimal 9010).\n   GetResponse-PDU messages\
    \ will be addressed to the IPX address and\n   socket from which the corresponding\
    \ GetRequest-PDU, GetNextRequest-\n   PDU, or SetRequest-PDU originated.\n"
- title: 2.2  Maximum Packet Length
  contents:
  - "2.2  Maximum Packet Length\n   Although SNMP does not require conformant implementations\
    \ to accept\n   messages whose length exceed 484 bytes, it is recommended that\n\
    \   implementations support a maximum SNMP message size of 546 bytes (the\n  \
    \ maximum size allowed under IPX).  Furthermore, this limit is the\n   maximum\
    \ packet length guaranteed to traverse IPX routers which do not\n   provide fragmentation.\
    \  Implementors may choose to use longer packet\n   lengths if the maximum is\
    \ known, which depends on the intermediate\n   routers and/or intermediate datalink\
    \ layer protocols.\n"
- title: 2.3  The agent-addr Field for the Trap-PDU
  contents:
  - "2.3  The agent-addr Field for the Trap-PDU\n   The agent-addr field in a Trap-PDU\
    \ emitted by an SNMP agent should\n   contain the IpAddress 0.0.0.0.  An SNMP\
    \ manager may ascertain the\n   source of the trap by querying the transport layer.\n"
- title: 2.4  IPX Transport Address Representation
  contents:
  - "2.4  IPX Transport Address Representation\n   There are occasions when it is\
    \ necessary to represent a transport\n   service address in a MIB.  For instance,\
    \ the SNMP party MIB [6] uses\n   an OBJECT IDENTIFIER to define the transport\
    \ domain (IP, IPX, etc.)\n   and an OCTET STRING to represent an address within\
    \ that domain.  The\n   following definitions are provided for use in such a scheme.\n\
    \ RFC1298-MIB DEFINITIONS ::= BEGIN\n    IMPORTS\n      enterprises         FROM\
    \ RFC1155-SMI;\n      novell              OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { enterprises\
    \ 23 }\n      transportDomains    OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { novell 7 }\n      ipxTransportDomain\
    \  OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { transportDomains 1 }\n    -- Authoritatively names\
    \ the IPX Transport Domain\n    IpxTransportAddress ::= OCTET STRING (SIZE (12))\n\
    \    -- A textual convention denoting a transport service address in\n    -- the\
    \ ipxTransportDomain.  An IpxTransportAddress is 12 octets\n    -- long and comprises\
    \ 3 fields, each in network-byte (high-low)\n    -- order.\n    -- The first field\
    \ is 4 octets long and contains the network\n    -- number.\n    -- The next field\
    \ is 6 octets long and contains the physical\n    -- address of the node.  Since\
    \ IPX can run over a variety of\n    -- subnet architectures, the physical node\
    \ address may not\n    -- require all 6 octets.  As specified in [2], the physical\n\
    \    -- node address will occupy the least significant portion of\n    -- the\
    \ field and the most significant octets should be set\n    -- to zero.\n    --\
    \ The last field is 2 octets long and contains the socket\n    -- number.\n END\n"
