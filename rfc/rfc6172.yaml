- title: Abstract

  - "Abstract\n   Changes to Fibre Channel have caused the specification of the\n\
    \   Internet Fibre Channel Protocol (iFCP) address translation mode to\n   become\
    \ incorrect.  Due to the absence of usage of iFCP address\n   translation mode,\
    \ it is deprecated by this document.  iFCP address\n   transparent mode remains\
    \ correctly specified.\n   iFCP address transparent mode has been implemented\
    \ and is in current\n   use; therefore, it is not affected by this document.\n\
    \   This document also records the state of Protocol Number 133, which\n   was\
    \ allocated for a pre-standard version of the Fibre Channel\n   Internet Protocol\
    \ (FCIP).\n"

- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   See Section 3 of [RFC4172] for introductory material on\
    \ Fibre Channel\n   concepts.\n   The Internet Fibre Channel Protocol (iFCP) [RFC4172]\
    \ operates in two\n   modes with respect to Fibre Channel N_PORT fabric addresses\
    \ (24-bit\n   N_PORT_IDs): address transparent mode and address translation mode\n\
    \   (both modes are specified in [RFC4172]):\n   o  Address transparent mode is\
    \ a pass-through mode that preserves\n      Fibre Channel N_PORT fabric addresses.\n\
    \   o  Address translation mode is a Fibre Channel analog to Network\n      Address\
    \ Translation (NAT) in which iFCP gateways change Fibre\n      Channel N_PORT\
    \ fabric addresses at the boundary between Fibre\n      Channel and the Internet.\
    \  Both the source (S_ID) and destination\n      (D_ID) N_PORT fabric addresses\
    \ may be changed by the iFCP\n      gateways.\n   This document deprecates iFCP\
    \ address translation mode because the\n   specification has not tracked changes\
    \ in Fibre Channel and because\n   there are no known implementations.\n   Protocol\
    \ Number 133 was allocated for a pre-standard version of the\n   Fibre Channel\
    \ Internet Protocol (FCIP) that encapsulated FC frames\n   directly in IP packets.\
    \  That protocol number is not used by the\n   standard FCIP protocol [RFC3821]\
    \ [FC-BB-3], but implementations of\n   the pre-standard protocol were deployed.\
    \  Therefore, this document\n   makes no change to the current allocation of Protocol\
    \ Number 133.\n"

- title: 3.  iFCP Address Translation Mode
  contents:
  - "3.  iFCP Address Translation Mode\n   iFCP address translation mode has to translate\
    \ addresses embedded in\n   transmitted data.  This is analogous to NAT translation\
    \ of IP\n   addresses embedded in IP packets.  Fibre Channel restricts the\n \
    \  occurrence of embedded fabric addresses to control messages (frames);\n   N_PORTs\
    \ send and receive two types of control frames that may contain\n   embedded fabric\
    \ addresses:\n   o  Extended Link Services (ELSs); and\n   o  FC-4 Link Services\
    \ (FC-4 LSs) for the Small Computer System\n      Interface (SCSI) over Fibre\
    \ Channel Protocol (FCP).\n   The embedded fabric address translations for N_PORT\
    \ control frames\n   are specified in Section 7.3 of [RFC4172].  These translations\
    \ were\n   correct as specified for Fibre Channel as of approximately 2003,\n\
    \   based on the [FC-FS] standard for ELSs and the [FCP] standard for FCP\n  \
    \ FC-4 LSs.\n"
- title: 3.1.  Problem Discussion
  contents:
  - "3.1.  Problem Discussion\n   Significant changes have been made to FC control\
    \ frames since the\n   iFCP specification [RFC4172] was published; the currently\
    \ applicable\n   FC standards are [FC-LS] and [FCP-3], and additional changes\
    \ are\n   forthcoming in the [FC-LS-2] and [FCP-4] standards projects, which\n\
    \   are nearing completion.  These changes have caused Section 7.3 of\n   [RFC4172]\
    \ to become incorrect.\n   Actual iFCP deployment has diverged significantly from\
    \ that\n   anticipated during the development of [RFC4172].  All deployments of\n\
    \   iFCP known to the authors of this document use iFCP address\n   transparent\
    \ mode and are used only for FC inter-switch links.  iFCP\n   address translation\
    \ mode as specified in [RFC4172] cannot be used for\n   FC inter-switch links\
    \ because the necessary embedded fabric address\n   translations for FC inter-switch\
    \ control messages (Switch Fabric\n   Internal Link Services (ILSs)) have not\
    \ been specified.\n"
- title: 3.2.  iFCP Address Translation Mode Deprecation
  contents:
  - "3.2.  iFCP Address Translation Mode Deprecation\n   For the reasons described\
    \ above, it is prudent to deprecate iFCP\n   address translation mode in preference\
    \ to updating it to the current\n   state of Fibre Channel standards.  Updating\
    \ iFCP address translation\n   mode would create a continuing requirement to update\
    \ an unused\n   protocol mode to match future changes to FC control frames.\n\
    \   Therefore, this document deprecates iFCP address translation mode:\n   o \
    \ iFCP address translation mode [RFC4172] SHOULD NOT be implemented\n      and\
    \ SHOULD NOT be used.\n   o  The status of [RFC4172] remains Proposed Standard\
    \ RFC in order to\n      retain the specification of iFCP address transparent\
    \ mode.\n   o  The [RFC4172] specification of iFCP address translation mode\n\
    \      should be treated as Historic [RFC2026].\n"
- title: 4.  FCIP and Protocol Number 133
  contents:
  - "4.  FCIP and Protocol Number 133\n   Protocol Number 133 was allocated for Fibre\
    \ Channel (FC) [IANA-IP]\n   and used by a pre-standard version of the FCIP protocol\
    \ that\n   encapsulates FC frames directly in IP packets.  The standard FCIP\n\
    \   protocol [RFC3821] [FC-BB-3] encapsulates FC frames in TCP and hence\n   does\
    \ not use Protocol Number 133, but implementations of the pre-\n   standard version\
    \ of the FCIP protocol were deployed [MR].  Based on\n   this deployment, the\
    \ protocol number needs to remain allocated.\n"
- title: 5.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "5.  Security Considerations\n   The security considerations for iFCP continue\
    \ to apply; see Section\n   10 of [RFC4172].\n"
- title: 6.  IANA Considerations
  contents:
  - "6.  IANA Considerations\n   IANA has added this document as a supplemental reference\
    \ for the\n   allocation of Protocol Number 133 but hasn't changed that allocation.\n"
- title: 7.  Conclusions
  contents:
  - "7.  Conclusions\n   For the reasons described in this document, iFCP Address\
    \ Translation\n   mode is deprecated, and the allocation of Protocol Number 133\
    \ remains\n   unchanged at this time.\n"
