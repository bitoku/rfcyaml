- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   Financial organizations and merchants that offer online\
    \ access to\n   their services frequently encounter fraud perpetrated against\
    \ their\n   customers' accounts.  In their attempts to combat these frauds, the\n\
    \   organizations and their law enforcement agencies could benefit\n   greatly\
    \ by sharing intelligence about fraud incidents and patterns\n   with similar\
    \ organizations and agencies.  This specification\n   standardizes a document\
    \ format by which they can share such\n   information.  It is intended to facilitate\
    \ multi-vendor\n   interoperability between conformant components of an open fraud\n\
    \   reporting framework.\n   Information sharing can take place directly between\
    \ financial\n   organizations and merchants.  However, the power of shared\n \
    \  intelligence is multiplied many times if the information is gathered\n   from\
    \ multiple sources by a shared network, consolidated, and\n   redistributed to\
    \ participants.\n   In this arrangement, incident reports submitted to the network\
    \ are\n   called \"inbound reports\", and reports issued by the network are\n\
    \   called \"outbound reports\".\n   Inbound reports will be submitted using a\
    \ push-style protocol (such\n   as email or the Simple Object Access Protocol\
    \ (SOAP)).  Outbound\n   reports will be distributed using either a push-style\
    \ protocol or a\n   request/response protocol (such as HTTP).\n   Inbound reports\
    \ identify the contributor of the report, as this\n   information is essential\
    \ in evaluating the quality of the information\n   it contains and in contacting\
    \ the source for the purpose of\n   clarification.  However, outbound reports\
    \ commonly do not identify\n   the original sources, as those sources may not\
    \ wish to be identified\n   to other subscribers.  Such reports should, instead,\
    \ identify the\n   consolidator as the source.\n   A report may describe a particular\
    \ transaction that is known to be,\n   or believed to be, fraudulent, or it may\
    \ describe a pattern of\n   behavior that is believed to be indicative of fraud.\
    \  The former type\n   of report is called an \"activity report\" and the latter\
    \ a \"signature\n   report\".\n   The schema defined herein extends the IODEF\
    \ XML incident reporting\n   schema [RFC5070].\n   In Section 3, we introduce\
    \ the actors in a typical transaction fraud.\n   Fraud reporting by means of an\
    \ IODEF-Document is described in\n   Section 4.  We define the elements of a Thraud\
    \ Report in Section 5.\n   In Section 6, we describe the Activity Thraud Report\
    \ profile of the\n   IODEF specification.  In Section 7, the profile for a Signature\n\
    \   Thraud Report is described.  In Section 8, we define new attribute\n   values\
    \ for the IODEF Incident class.  Security considerations are\n   described in\
    \ Section 9.  Section 10 contains IANA considerations\n   regarding the registration\
    \ of the associated media sub-type and XML\n   namespace identifier.  The Appendices\
    \ contain the complete XML schema\n   and a sample Thraud Report.\n   Data elements\
    \ in this document are expressed in Unified Modeling\n   Language (UML) syntax\
    \ [UML].\n   XML namespace prefixes are used throughout this document to stand\
    \ for\n   their respective XML namespaces, as follows.\n      iodef:   urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:iodef-1.0\n\
    \      thraud:  urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:thraud-1.0\n      xs:      http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema\n\

    \ Fraud Elements\n   Transaction fraud activities normally involve the following\
    \ actors:\n   1.  Fraudsters: individuals or organizations that collect victims'\n\
    \       login credentials using a variety of means, including phishing\n     \
    \  and malware, and verify them (usually by attempting to log in to\n       the\
    \ victim's account).  Then, the Fraudsters may either recruit\n       Fraud Executors\
    \ themselves or wholesale the victims' credentials\n       to other Fraudsters,\
    \ who will, in turn, recruit Fraud Executors.\n   2.  Fraud Executors: individuals\
    \ who attempt the fraudulent funds\n       transfer or payment.  In the case of\
    \ fraudulent funds transfers,\n       an account at either the same financial\
    \ organization as that of\n       the victim or a different one is opened as the\
    \ destination\n       account for the fraudulent transfer.  Alternatively, a fraudulent\n\
    \       payment is made using a check or electronic transfer.\n   3.  Victims\
    \ of both credential theft and transaction fraud.\n   4.  Financial organizations\
    \ that hold the victim's and the Fraud\n       Executor's accounts.\n   5.  Sensors\
    \ at the financial organization that detect fraudulent\n       transaction attempts,\
    \ either in real-time or after the fact.\n   The intention of Thraud reporting\
    \ is to enable any organization that\n   has detected fraud to share this information,\
    \ either internally or\n   with other potential victim organizations.  The receiving\n\
    \   organization can use this information, for example, to institute\n   manual\
    \ review of transactions initiated from suspicious IP addresses.\n"

  - "9.  Security Considerations\n   This document describes a document format for\
    \ exchanging information\n   about successful or attempted transaction and authentication\
    \ fraud\n   incidents.  The information is intended to be used to improve the\n\
    \   effectiveness of participants' fraud detection and prevention\n   programs.\
    \  The effectiveness of such programs depends critically on\n   the accuracy,\
    \ reliability, confidentiality, and timeliness of both\n   the information and\
    \ the participants in its exchange.  Threats to\n   accuracy, reliability, and\
    \ confidentiality include (but are not\n   limited to) those described here.\n\
    \   Fraudsters may attempt to introduce reports that delete or modify\n   incident\
    \ information in the corpus.  Therefore, origin authentication\n   MUST be employed.\
    \  Human review SHOULD be performed prior to\n   implementing modifications to\
    \ the corpus.\n   Fraudsters may attempt to interrupt or redirect submissions,\
    \ thereby\n   preventing the sharing of intelligence concerning their fraud\n\
    \   strategies.  Therefore, authenticated receipts SHOULD be employed.\n   Fraudsters\
    \ may attempt to impersonate legitimate submitters, thereby\n   poisoning their\
    \ reputations and rendering ineffective their future\n   submissions.  Origin\
    \ authentication MUST be used to ensure that the\n   sources of reports are properly\
    \ identified.\n   Fraudsters that can view incident reports may adapt their fraud\n\
    \   strategies to avoid detection.  Therefore, reports MUST be protected\n   by\
    \ confidentiality services including transport encryption and access\n   control.\n\
    \   In order to prevent inadvertent disclosure of incident data, incident\n  \
    \ reports SHOULD be encrypted while in storage.\n   The submitter of an incident\
    \ report may incorrectly identify\n   legitimate activity as a fraud incident.\
    \  This may lead to denial of\n   service by a receiving organization that relies\
    \ on the report or\n   information derived from the report.  Receiving organizations\
    \ SHOULD\n   operate a reputation service, in which the reliability of the\n \
    \  information from particular sources is assessed and tracked and\n   subsequent\
    \ reports are weighted accordingly.  The source of reports\n   MUST be authenticated.\
    \  Receiving organizations SHOULD use reports to\n   step up authentication assurance,\
    \ rather than simply denying service.\n   A receiving organization may misuse\
    \ a Thraud Report to deny service,\n   resulting in a loss for a legitimate user.\
    \  If such a user were to\n   learn the identity of the source of the information\
    \ that led to the\n   denial of service, then that source may become implicated\
    \ in any\n   resulting claim for compensation.  This, in turn, may discourage\n\
    \   reporting organizations from participating in intelligence sharing.\n   Therefore,\
    \ original sources SHOULD NOT be identified in consolidated\n   reports.\n   Any\
    \ origin authentication and data integrity mechanism that is\n   acceptable to\
    \ both parties MAY be used.\n   Any transport confidentiality mechanism that is\
    \ acceptable to both\n   parties MAY be used.\n   This specification does not\
    \ include a data compression technique.\n   Therefore, it does not introduce any\
    \ denial of service\n   vulnerabilities related to decompression.\n"
