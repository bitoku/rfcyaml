  - "Abstract\n   This document describes a Uniform Resource Name (URN) namespace\n\
    \   (RFC 3406) for the assignment of the Common Language Equipment\n   Identifier\
    \ (CLEI) code, which is used in messages standardized by\n   ANSI.  The URN namespace\
    \ is managed by Telcordia Technologies, Inc.,\n   as the maintenance agent for\
    \ ANSI T1.213.  The CLEI code is a\n   globally unique, ten-character alphanumeric\
    \ intelligent code assigned\n   by Telcordia Technologies at the request of equipment\
    \ suppliers.  The\n   CLEI code identifies communications equipment by specifying\
    \ product\n   type and features.  There is a one-to-one relationship between a\
    \ CLEI\n   code and supplier's product ID (the manufacturer's name and the part\n\
    \   number along with its version number).\n"

  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   Many circuit cards used in the global telecommunications\
    \ network have\n   a CLEI code assigned and have a bar code or two-dimensional\
    \ symbol on\n   a label affixed to the front.  Service providers utilize the CLEI\n\
    \   code to:\n   o  Track inventory, both working and spare\n   o  Handle logistics\
    \ (movement of circuit cards, along with the serial\n      number)\n   o  Provision\
    \ equipment\n   o  Maintain asset records (accounting information)\n   The goal\
    \ of the CLEI namespace is to ensure the stability and\n   uniqueness of the names\
    \ of various (specific) items that are used\n   within the messages exchanged\
    \ between equipment of the global\n   telecommunications network.\n   The assigned\
    \ maintenance agent for the CLEI code, Telcordia\n   Technologies, is responsible\
    \ for assigning certain equipment and\n   other identifiers (e.g., location, manufacturer/supplier)\
    \ for the\n   telecommunications industry.  The code assignment process identifies\n\
    \   the structure and intelligence of the CLEI code to identify the\n   circuit\
    \ card's form, fit, functions, and features.  Equipment may\n   exist in multiple\
    \ physical locations with the exact same form, fit,\n   functions, and features;\
    \ such equipment will have the same CLEI code\n   if their product ID is the same.\n"

    \      +1.732.699.5577\n      http://www.commonlanguage.com\n   Declaration of\
    \ syntactic structures:\n      The structure of the Namespace Specific String\
    \ is a flat space of\n      10 characters, as defined in [T1.213][T1.213a].\n\
    \   Relevant ancillary documentation:\n      [T1.213] and [T1.213a].\n   Identifier\
    \ uniqueness considerations:\n      Identifiers are assigned by Telcordia URN\
    \ registration that\n      guarantees uniqueness for items with different form,\
    \ fit,\n      functions, and features.  This is achieved simply by comparing all\n\
    \      new proposed names to the already assigned names contained in a\n     \
    \ database.  If the name already exists, a new one is created per\n      the rules\
    \ of the process.  See [T1.213][T1.213a] for assignment\n      examples.\n   Identifiers\
    \ persistence considerations:\n      The process defined by ANSI and the CLEI\
    \ maintenance agent ensure\n      that the binding between the name and its resource\
    \ is permanent,\n      and that names are not reassigned.\n   Process of identifiers\
    \ assignment:\n      A CLEI code is an intelligent code that consists of 10\n\
    \      alphanumeric characters with 4 data elements.  The first data\n      element\
    \ is considered the basic code with the first 2 characters\n      indicating the\
    \ technology or equipment type, and the third and\n      fourth characters denoting\
    \ the functional sub-category.  The\n      second data element represents the\
    \ features, and its three\n      characters denote functional capabilities or\
    \ changes.  The third\n      data element has one character and denotes a reference\
    \ to a\n      manufacturer, system ID, specification, or drawing.  The fourth\n\
    \      data element consists of two characters and contains complementary\n  \
    \    data.  These two characters provide a means of differentiating or\n     \
    \ providing uniqueness between the eight character CLEI codes by\n      identifying\
    \ the manufacturing vintage of the product.  Names are\n      assigned via procedures\
    \ defined in [GR485].\n   Process for identifier resolution:\n      Telcordia\
    \ URNs are resolved via Telcordia resolvers run under\n      Telcordia responsibility.\
    \  For further information see\n      www.commonlanguage.com.\n   Rules for lexical\
    \ equivalence:\n      Lexical equivalence of two CLEI URN namespace specific strings\
    \ is\n      defined as an exact, case-insensitive string match.  CLEI codes\n\
    \      are assigned in a case-insensitive fashion, so that there will not\n  \
    \    be two CLEI codes that differ only in case.  See [T1.213] and\n      [T1.213a]\
    \ for further information.\n   Conformance with URN syntax:\n      No special\
    \ consideration.\n   Validation mechanism:\n      None specified.\n   Scope:\n\
    \      Global.\n"

  contents:
  - "4.  Namespace and Community Considerations\n   CLEI codes have historically been\
    \ used in a variety of communications\n   equipment (see examples above and [T1.213a]).\
    \  There are\n   circumstances in which entities with CLEI codes need to be managed\
    \ or\n   exposed in a larger context, such as the general Internet.  In these\n\
    \   cases, the use of the CLEI URN namespace will provide general\n   interoperability\
    \ benefits to the Internet at large, as well as to\n   specific internets.\n"
- title: 5.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "5.  Security Considerations\n   There are no additional security considerations\
    \ other than those\n   normally associated with the use and resolution of URNs\
    \ in general.\n   However, note that attempting to resolve a Telcordia URN through\
    \ a\n   resolver other than the one provided by Telcordia is not considered\n\
    \   authoritative.\n"
