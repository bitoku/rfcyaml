- title: Abstract
  contents:
  - "Abstract\n   The Internet X.400 community (i.e., GO-MHS) currently lacks a\n\
    \   distributed mechanism providing dynamic updating and management of\n   message\
    \ routing information.  The IETF MHS-DS Working Group has\n   specified an approach\
    \ for X.400 Message Handling Systems to perform\n   message routing using OSI\
    \ Directory Services.  The MHS-DS approach\n   has been successfully tested in\
    \ a number of local environments.\n   This memo describes a proposed Internet\
    \ Pilot Project that seeks to\n   prove the MHS-DS approach on a larger scale.\
    \  The results of this\n   pilot will then be used to draw up recommendations\
    \ for a global\n   deployment.\n"
- title: 1. Background
  contents:
  - "1. Background\n   The 1988 edition of X.400 introduces, among other extensions\
    \ or\n   revisions, the concept of O/R Names which assumes the existence of a\n\
    \   widely available Directory Service.  This Directory Service is needed\n  \
    \ to support several MHS operations (support for names to identify\n   senders\
    \ and receivers of messages in a user-friendly fashion, support\n   for distribution\
    \ lists, authentication of MHS components, description\n   of MHS components capabilities...).\n\
    \   The prime advantage of Directory Names, as perceived by many users,\n   was\
    \ to release users from the remembering of complex O/R Addresses\n   for their\
    \ correspondents.\n   In the MHS infrastructure, as compared to other protocols,\
    \ a name by\n   itself does not contain enough information to allow the Message\n\
    \   Transfer Agents (MTAs) to route a message to the User Agent (UA)\n   servicing\
    \ this name.  The routing process is based on information\n   provided by different\
    \ MHS Management Domains, whether they are public\n   or private.\n   An MHS community\
    \ combines several administrative MHS domains among\n   which agreements for cooperative\
    \ routing exist:  the GO-MHS community\n   is the set of MTA's taking care of\
    \ X.400 mail operations on the\n   Internet [RFC 1649].\n   In the absence of\
    \ a distributed Directory Service, an interim\n   technique has been developed\
    \ within the GO-MHS community to collect\n   and advertise routing information.\
    \  This resulted in an experimental\n   IETF protocol [RFC 1465].\n"
- title: 2. Rationale
  contents:
  - "2. Rationale\n   A number of routing problems are preventing the present Internet\n\
    \   X.400 service from expanding its number of participating message\n   transfer\
    \ agents to a global scale.  The two most critical problems\n   are:\n      *\
    \ The present mechanism of centrally maintained and advertized\n        MTA routing\
    \ tables has been optimized as far as possible.\n        Increasing the number\
    \ of directly connected MTAs increases also\n        the workload on the MHS managers.\
    \  The current solution does\n        not scale.  Routing must be a fully dynamic\
    \ and distributed\n        process.\n      * Manual propagation and installation\
    \ of routing tables do not\n        guarantee consistency of routing information\
    \ (even in a loose\n        fashion) when it is accessed by different MTAs scattered\
    \ across\n        the globe.\n   It is commonly accepted that a distributed mechanism\
    \ providing for\n   dynamic updating and management of X.400 routing information\
    \ is\n   highly desirable.  The focus of the project is to establish X.500-\n\
    \   based support of X.400 routing, at a very large scale.\n"
- title: 3. Benefits
  contents:
  - "3. Benefits\n   Using the Directory as a dynamic means of information storage\
    \ and\n   advertisement will guarantee participants in Project Long Bud that\n\
    \   their updated data are globally available to the community.  As a\n   direct\
    \ consequence of the above, a participating MHS manager will be\n   released from\
    \ configuring connections to the other participants.\n   Directory-capable MTAs\
    \ will be able to discover more optimal and more\n   direct routes to X.400 destinations\
    \ than are practical today.  This\n   will enable faster delivery of messages.\n\
    \   The infrastructure reliability will be improved:  the information\n   stored\
    \ in the Directory will allow automatic use of backup\n   connections in case\
    \ of remote MTA or network problems.  X.400 mail\n   managers in the GO-MHS Community\
    \ should then be released from the\n   need to know the complexity of the whole\
    \ mail routing infrastructure.\n   Providing a dynamic routing infrastructure\
    \ will eliminate\n   inconsistencies introduced by unsynchronized static tables\
    \ and\n   improve quality of service.\n   Furthermore, besides the robustness\
    \ and the optimization of the new\n   routing infrastructure, the Long Bud approach\
    \ should bring to the\n   participating organizations better control over how\
    \ they establish\n   and maintain their interconnection with the GO-MHS community.\n\
    \   Participants will share in building an X.400 network which can expand\n  \
    \ to a very large scale.  They will develop experience using a global\n   messaging\
    \ architecture which scales well and requires minimal\n   administrative overhead.\
    \  They will be able to discuss experience\n   with the MHS-DS experts and architects\
    \ in the ongoing standards\n   development cycle.\n"
- title: 4. Definition of project LONG BUD
  contents:
  - "4. Definition of project LONG BUD\n   The Long Bud pilot wishes to demonstrate\
    \ that the X.500 Directory is\n   able to provide a global-scale service to messaging\
    \ applications.\n   Although MHS-DS provides ways to use private routing trees,\
    \ Long Bud\n   will focus on the Open Community Routing Tree as used by the GO-MHS\n\
    \   community.\n"
- title: 4.1 Project Goals
  contents:
  - "4.1 Project Goals\n   Project Long Bud has the following goals:\n   * Gather\
    \ pilot experience of the defined framework for X.500\n     support of MTA routing,\
    \ as defined by the IETF MHS-DS Working\n     Group [Kille 94].\n   * Actively\
    \ investigate migration of the existing operational\n     X.400 service from a\
    \ routing method based upon distribution of\n     centrally maintained static\
    \ tables, as specified in [RFC 1465],\n     to a method based instead upon X.500:\n\
    \       -- Deploy X.400 MTAs which are directly capable of reading\n         \
    \ routing information from the X.500 Directory, in\n          compliance with\
    \ the specifications of the MHS-DS Working\n          Group.  This type of MTA\
    \ is called a directory-capable\n          MTA.\n       -- Deploy tools which\
    \ read routing information from the X.500\n          Directory and use it to generate\
    \ static routing tables for\n          MTAs which are not directory-capable.\n\
    \   * specify a set of minimal operational requirements needed before\n     X.500-based\
    \ routing of X.400 messages can be widely deployed.\n"
- title: 4.2 Phasing
  contents:
  - "4.2 Phasing\n   The first phase of Project Long Bud consists in deploying a small\n\
    \   number of directory-capable MTAs operated by members of the MHS-DS\n   Working\
    \ Group and GO-MHS community.  These MTAs must be capable of\n   using information\
    \ in the X.500 directory to route messages to all\n   other members of the project\
    \ as well as to the existing GO-MHS\n   community.  As of this writing, an initial\
    \ set of MTAs is already\n   operational.\n   At the end of this phase, the following\
    \ goals should be achieved:\n   * The X.500 DIT must be populated with enough\
    \ routing information\n     to allow the participating MTAs to route reliably\
    \ messages to\n     each other and to the existing GO-MHS community.\n   * The\
    \ X.500 DSAs holding the routing information must operate at\n     a quality of\
    \ service that is acceptable for an operational\n     X.400 service.\n   As a\
    \ prerequisite, a sufficient number of MTA managers must be\n   willing to participate\
    \ in Project Long Bud for the first set of\n   results to be significant.  Support\
    \ for a protocol stack conforming\n   to [RFC 1006] is mandatory.  All MTAs participating\
    \ in the Long Bud\n   pilot need to register in the Open Tree and must be prepared\
    \ to\n   accept connections from anyone.\n   Note that in the first phase, default\
    \ routes will be established in\n   the DIT such that messages addressed to destinations\
    \ outside of the\n   Long Bud community will be routed to designated MTAs in the\
    \ GO-MHS\n   community.  This will allow for full connectivity between the Long\n\
    \   Bud community and the GO-MHS community which are related, but\n   distinct\
    \ communities.  Interworking between these two must be\n   established and coordinated.\n\
    \   In the second phase of Project Long Bud, a greater number of MTAs\n   should\
    \ be added to the experiment.  Cooperation with non directory-\n   capable communities\
    \ must be addressed.\n"
- title: 4.3 General Approach
  contents:
  - "4.3 General Approach\n   No large scale resources have been committed to this\
    \ project.  Yet,\n   expedient deployment is desirable.  Therefore, the pilot\
    \ project\n   needs to be focused and relatively short-lived.  The general approach\n\
    \   for satisfying these requirements includes:\n   * Use as many existing MHS-DS\
    \ tools as possible.  Also, continue\n     to track the progress of tools being\
    \ developed by project\n     members and facilitate their deployment as soon as\
    \ they are\n     ready.\n   * Coordinate efforts with existing GO-MHS community\
    \ service.\n   * Establish a core infrastructure:  4 DSAs (two in the United\n\
    \     States and two in Europe) are set up to serve MHS-DS\n     information.\n\
    \   * Wherever it is technically feasable, DSA managers will\n     establish bilateral\
    \ agreements with one (or more) of the core\n     DSAs in order to duplicate their\
    \ routing information.  For\n     example, the core DSAs support the replication\
    \ protocol\n     specified in [RFC 1275] as a duplication technique.\n   * the\
    \ Long Bud pilot needs to cooperate actively with DANTE\n     NameFlow (the continuation\
    \ of the PARADISE Pilot) and other\n     directory providers in order to promote\
    \ stability and\n     consistency of informations.\n"
- title: 4.4 Tools Needed
  contents:
  - "4.4 Tools Needed\n   To facilitate widespread deployment of MHS-DS routing technology\
    \ and\n   to foster interworking between directory-capable MTAs and MTAs which\n\
    \   are not directory-capable, tools providing the following\n   functionalities\
    \ need to be developed:\n   populate the Directory with routing information: \
    \ such a tool must\n        accept routing information specified in the standard\
    \ syntax\n        used by the GO-MHS community (see [RFC 1465]) as input, and\
    \ it\n        will load or update entries which convey the same information\n\
    \        in the X.500 Directory.\n   downloading of routing information from the\
    \ Directory:  in order to\n        provide a migration path for organizations\
    \ not using\n        directory-capable MTAs, a tool is needed which will read\
    \ X.400\n        routing information from the X.500 Directory and generate\n \
    \       static routing information from it.  The syntax of the static\n      \
    \  information generated will conform to the syntax defined by the\n        GO-MHS\
    \ community, so that \"classical\" MTAs run as they\n        currently do.\n \
    \  displaying route taken by a message between two end-points:  this\n       \
    \ tool should accept two parameters as input:  the X.500\n        distinguished\
    \ name of an MTA, and an X.400 O/R name.  It will\n        display the possible\
    \ routes which may be taken in order to\n        deliver a message from the specified\
    \ MTA to the specified X.400\n        destination.  This tool looks very much\
    \ the same as the\n        traceroute facility used at the IP level.\n   These\
    \ tools must use standard protocols to access the Directory (such\n   as DAP [CCITT\
    \ 88] or LDAP [RFC 1487]).  Portability is encouraged.\n   A note on quality\n\
    \   Pilot use of this Directory information depends heavily on data\n   quality\
    \ and availability.  Although the administration of DSA\n   availability and global\
    \ Directory data accuracy are not in the scope\n   of Long Bud, care must be taken\
    \ that Directory resources used by Long\n   Bud participants are administrated\
    \ well.\n   If they have the technical ability to do so, Long Bud participants\n\
    \   are encouraged to replicate routing information in their Directory to\n  \
    \ improve data availability.\n   Directory data used by the pilot must be accurate:\
    \  solutions to this\n   problem will be recommanded as the project matures.\n"
- title: 5. Participation Guide
  contents:
  - "5. Participation Guide\n   The existing operational X.400 service, the GO-MHS\
    \ service, uses the\n   following method to distribute and manage X.400 routing\
    \ information:\n   A group of MTAs is organized into a routing community.  The\
    \ community\n   keeps its routing information up to date by assigning to each\
    \ MTA\n   manager the responsibility of determining the routing information for\n\
    \   his/her MTA, formalizing this routing information in the syntax\n   defined\
    \ by the community and sending the result to the GO-MHS\n   coordination service.\
    \  Once the information has been validated\n   against the other data provided\
    \ by all managers in the community, the\n   coordination service will advertise\
    \ it to the whole community.  Each\n   manager will then have to update his/her\
    \ MTA configuration with the\n   verified information.\n   The purpose of Project\
    \ Long Bud is to allow a manager to operate an\n   MTA without having to perform\
    \ ANY manual steps when another MTA\n   manager adds new or changes existing routing\
    \ information.  This will\n   facilitate efficient, dynamic, and manageable interconnection\
    \ of very\n   large communities of MTAs.  It will allow the Internet X.400\n \
    \  community to overcome the limitations in scalability which it is\n   currently\
    \ encountering.\n"
- title: 5.1 Prerequisites for participation

  - "5.1 Prerequisites for participation\n   The prerequisites for joining Project\
    \ Long Bud are:\n   Step 1:  Participants in the pilot must have a good knowledge\
    \ of\n            the IETF MHS-DS Working Group activities and documents:\n  \
    \        1. Participants must join the MHS-DS distribution list:\n           \
    \        RFC-822:  mhs-ds@mercury.udev.cdc.com\n                     X.400:  PN=mhs-ds;\

    \ must retrieve and become familiar with all\n             relevant tools and\
    \ documents stored on the Project Long\n             Bud anonymous FTP server\n\
    \                           Host name:  ftp.css.cdc.com\n                    \
    \       Directory:  pub/mhs-ds/long-bud\n             In particular, openly available\
    \ software related to Long\n             Bud activities will be kept up-to-date\
    \ at this location.\n          3. If not already done, participants must do one\
    \ of the\n             following:\n               * Upgrade their X.400 and X.500\
    \ software such that it\n                 supports the MHS-DS specifications as\
    \ in [Kille 94].\n               * Use the tools which extract MHS-DS information\
    \ from\n                 the directory and generate whatever local\n         \
    \        configuration files are necessary to allow local MTA's\n            \
    \     to use the information.  This should be done\n                 frequently\
    \ (at least once per day).\n   Step 2:  Participants must register required entries\
    \ in the\n            Directory so that their MTA(s) is (are) known to the\n \
    \           Directory.\n          1. Arrange with the appropriate DSA Manager\
    \ (who can be a\n             local manager if the DSA is run by the participating\n\
    \             organization, or a manager who is in charge of running the\n   \
    \          organization's DSA) to create an entry for the local\n            \
    \ MTA(s) involved in the pilot.  At this stage, only\n             connection\
    \ information is required.\n          2. Check, test and verify the connection\
    \ information with at\n             least one other participant.  The mhs-ds distribution\
    \ list\n             should be used for announcing the new registration and\n\
    \             asking volunteers for testing.\n          3. Participants must establish\
    \ sensible default X.400 routes\n             to existing GO-MHS destinations\
    \ for which X.500-based\n             routing information will not exist initially.\n\
    \   Step 3:  Participants can then enter their routing information in\n      \
    \      the Directory.\n          1. Before any routing is entered in the DIT,\
    \ participants\n             must check with the GO-MHS Coordination Service that\
    \ the\n             routes they want to register can be properly handled by\n\
    \             the GO-MHS community (contact information is\n             mailflow@mailflow.dante.net).\
    \  It is crucial for the Pilot\n             that any routing information entered\
    \ in the Directory is\n             kept carefully accurate if the experiment\
    \ is to be\n             meaningful.  Participants may also consider the need\
    \ for\n             mapping rules (see [RFC 1465] for details).\n          2.\
    \ Once the above step is validated by the GO-MHS\n             Coordination Service,\
    \ participants must record routing\n             information for their MTA(s)\
    \ in the Internet X.500\n             directory service.  This requires that a\
    \ participant does\n             the following:\n               * Arrange with\
    \ the appropriate DSA Manager (who can be\n                 either a local manager\
    \ if the DSA is run by the\n                 participating organization or a manager\
    \ which is in\n                 charge of running the organization's DSA) to enter\n\
    \                 X.400 routing information in a routing tree held by\n      \
    \           the participating organization.  This routing tree\n             \
    \    should contain all necessary information for the local\n                \
    \ mail domain.\n               * Check, test and verify the registered routing\n\
    \                 information with at least one other participant.  The\n    \
    \             mhs-ds distribution list should be used for announcing\n       \
    \          the new registration and asking volunteers for\n                 testing.\n\
    \          3. If a participant adds new nonleaf entries to the Open\n        \
    \     Community Routing Tree, then s/he must find at least one\n             other\
    \ participant who will maintain a slave copy of the\n             children of\
    \ the nonleaf entry.  Send email to the mhs-ds\n             distribution list\
    \ in order to find a partner who is\n             willing to do this.\n      \
    \    4. If a participant adds new nonleaf ADMD or PRMD entries to\n          \
    \   the directory, then s/he must contact the managers of the\n             Long\
    \ Bud core DSA's and arrange to provide slave copies of\n             the children\
    \ of the ADMD and/or PRMD entries to all of the\n             core DSA's.  Send\
    \ email to the mhs-ds distribution list in\n             order to contact the\
    \ core DSA managers.\n          5. Once the above testing is completed, send email\
    \ to the\n             mhs-ds distribution list announcing the establishment of\n\
    \             new X.500-based routes.\n"
