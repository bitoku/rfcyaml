- title: '1.  Introduction: Issues/Problems in the IETF Process'
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction: Issues/Problems in the IETF Process\n   Discussion started\
    \ in the second half of 2002 has shown that a\n   significant number of problems\
    \ are believed to exist in the way the\n   Internet Engineering Taskforce (IETF)\
    \ operates.  Before attempting to\n   change the IETF procedures and rules to\
    \ deal with these problems, the\n   IETF should have a clear, agreed-upon description\
    \ of what problems we\n   are trying to solve.\n   The Problem Statement working\
    \ group was chartered to create this\n   document, which contains a description\
    \ of the problems, and to use\n   this analysis to suggest processes to address\
    \ the identified\n   problems.\n   Taken in isolation, this document may appear\
    \ to be exceedingly\n   negative.  The IETF needs to refresh its management and\
    \ processes to\n   address today's challenges, but it should not be forgotten\
    \ that the\n   IETF has produced a large body of high quality work which has lead\
    \ to\n   an extremely successful and pervasive network infrastructure.\n   Against\
    \ this background, we should see the current document as a\n   necessary piece\
    \ of self-criticism leading to renewal and continued\n   success.  The discussion\
    \ of the positive aspects has been\n   deliberately confined to the IETF Problem\
    \ Resolution Processes\n   document [5] which considers the core values that the\
    \ IETF needs to\n   maintain whilst correcting the problems that participants\
    \ perceive as\n   affecting the IETF at present.\n   The raw material for this\
    \ document was derived by summarizing the\n   extensive discussions which initially\
    \ took place on the 'wgchairs'\n   mailing list and subsequently on the 'problem-statement'\
    \ mailing list\n   from November 2002 through to September 2003, incorporating\n\
    \   additional input from relevant drafts published during this period\n   (see\
    \ [2], [3] and [4]), and the minutes of recent plenary\n   discussions.  This\
    \ produced a list of perceived problems which were\n   classified into a number\
    \ of related groups using a classification\n   suggested by the processes which\
    \ go on in the IETF.\n   This document has digested these perceived problems into\
    \ a small set\n   of root cause issues, and a short list of subsidiary issues\
    \ which\n   appear to be the most pressing items engendered by the root cause.\n\
    \   This list is set out in Section 2.\n   Section 1.1 gives a short explanation\
    \ of the thinking that has taken\n   place in coming to the current view of the\
    \ root causes.\n   The original summary of perceived problems has been posted\
    \ to the\n   Problem Statement Working Group mailing list so that it can be\n\
    \   referred to in future.  Note that it remains classified according the\n  \
    \ original scheme so that the raw data is available if alternative root\n   cause\
    \ analysis is needed.\n"
- title: 1.1.  Consequences of Past Growth
  contents:
  - "1.1.  Consequences of Past Growth\n   As the problems of the IETF were examined,\
    \ it became clear that they\n   are neither new nor are they symptoms of a problem\
    \ which is novel in\n   the science of organizations.\n   The IETF started off\
    \ as a small, focused organization with a clearly\n   defined mission and participants\
    \ who had been working in this area\n   for a significant period of time.  Over\
    \ the period 1989-1999, the\n   IETF grew by a factor of ten or more in terms\
    \ of number of\n   participants, and volume of work in progress.  The effects\
    \ of this\n   growth have been compounded by the extension of the scope of the\
    \ IETF\n   which makes the work much more varied.  Also during this period, the\n\
    \   Internet has become more complex and the requirements placed on it by\n  \
    \ a far larger user community have changed as the network has come to\n   have\
    \ a pivotal role in many areas of life.\n   Many of the problems and symptoms\
    \ appear to be fundamentally caused\n   by the organization failing to fully adapt\
    \ its management structure\n   and processes to its new larger size and the increased\
    \ complexity of\n   the work.  The IETF has also failed to clearly define its\
    \ future\n   mission now that the initial mission has been completed or outgrown.\n\
    \   These failures are just those that afflict many small organizations\n   trying\
    \ to make the transition from a small organization, which can be\n   run informally\
    \ and where essentially all participants fully share the\n   aims, values, and\
    \ motivations of the leadership, to a medium sized\n   organization, where there\
    \ are too many participants for informal\n   leadership and later arrivals either\
    \ do not fully understand or have\n   a different perception of the ethos of the\
    \ organization.\n   Some IETF participants have been aware of these issues for\
    \ a long\n   time.  Records dating back to at least 1992 drew similar conclusions.\n"
- title: 1.2.  The Aim is Improvement, not Finger-pointing
  contents:
  - "1.2.  The Aim is Improvement, not Finger-pointing\n   Many of the problems identified\
    \ in this memo have been remarkably\n   persistent over a 15-year period, surviving\
    \ a number of changes in\n   personnel.  We see them as structural problems, not\
    \ personnel\n   problems.  Blame for any of the perceived problems should not\
    \ be\n   directed to any individual.  The sole aim of this review process is\n\
    \   to identify how the IETF can improve itself so that it knows what it\n   is\
    \ about and becomes fit for that purpose in the shortest possible\n   time frame.\n"
- title: 1.3.  Perceived Problems - Consensus on Solutions
  contents:
  - "1.3.  Perceived Problems - Consensus on Solutions\n   The working group participants\
    \ emphasize that both the long list of\n   problems and the root cause issues\
    \ that were derived from them are\n   problems that are believed to exist by a\
    \ significant constituency,\n   either on the mailing list and/or in private discussions.\
    \  We also\n   note that many of these problems appear to be of long standing,\
    \ as a\n   very similar list has survived from the discussions in the first\n\
    \   POISED working group that took place prior to the IETF organizational\n  \
    \ changes approved in 1992.\n   We, in line with many contributors to the mailing\
    \ list, believe that\n   it is important to try and identify what appear to be\
    \ the root causes\n   of the perceived problems, but trying to prioritize or assign\
    \ a\n   relative importance to the problems would not be useful: rough\n   consensus\
    \ on an unordered list of real and important root causes will\n   be sufficient.\
    \  The root causes identified will provide a guide in\n   setting up the processes\
    \ needed to resolve the problems: the\n   perceived problems can be viewed as\
    \ multiple symptoms of the root\n   causes which should provide input to those\
    \ trying to resolve the\n   problems in achieving consensus on solutions.\n"
- title: 2.  Root Cause Problems
  contents:
  - "2.  Root Cause Problems\n   This section forms the heart of this analysis, and\
    \ lists the issues\n   which we believe lie at the core of the problems.  Apart\
    \ from the\n   first issue which is fundamental, the problems are not necessarily\
    \ in\n   priority order, but they will be seen to be interlinked in various\n\
    \   ways.\n"
- title: 2.1.  Participants in the IETF do not have a Common Understanding of
  contents:
  - "2.1.  Participants in the IETF do not have a Common Understanding of\n      its\
    \ Mission\n   The IETF lacks a clearly defined and commonly understood Mission:\
    \ as\n   a result, the goals and priorities for the IETF as a whole and any\n\
    \   Working Groups (WGs) that are chartered are also unclear.\n   The IETF needs\
    \ to understand its mission in the context of the\n   greatly increased scope\
    \ and complexity of the Internet, and the\n   changing requirements of the much\
    \ larger user community that the\n   success of its previous work has engendered.\n\
    \   The lack of a common mission has many consequences, of which the\n   principal\
    \ ones appear to be:\n   o  The IETF is unsure what it is trying to achieve and\
    \ hence cannot\n      know what its optimum internal organization should be to\
    \ achieve\n      its aims.\n   o  The IETF cannot determine what its 'scope' should\
    \ be, and hence\n      cannot decide whether a piece of proposed work is either\
    \ in-scope\n      or out-of-scope.\n   o  The IETF is unsure who its stakeholders\
    \ are.  Consequently,\n      certain groups of stakeholder, who could otherwise\
    \ provide\n      important input to the process, have been more or less sidelined\n\
    \      because it has seemed to these stakeholders that the organization\n   \
    \   does not give due weight to their input.\n   o  Working Groups can potentially\
    \ be hijacked by sectional interests\n      to the detriment of the IETF's mission.\n\
    \   o  The misty vision has inhibited the development of roadmaps that\n     \
    \ would inform the IETF's stakeholders of our longer term\n      intentions, as\
    \ well as restricting the associated architectural\n      views to an outline\
    \ top level view which does not fully reflect\n      the developing nature of\
    \ the Internet.  It would be desirable to\n      have roadmaps and architectural\
    \ views for portions of work which\n      extend beyond a single working group:\
    \  it may also be the case\n      that it is no longer possible to fit the whole\
    \ Internet within a\n      single architecture.\n   o  The IETF is unable to determine\
    \ explicitly what effect it desires\n      to have in the marketplace, and is\
    \ therefore unable to determine\n      what requirements of timeliness are appropriate\
    \ when planning work\n      and setting expectations for stakeholders which will\
    \ further the\n      IETF's mission.\n   o  The lack of precision regarding our\
    \ goals leads to WG charters and\n      requirements that are poorly thought out\
    \ and/or not aligned with\n      the overall architecture.  The resulting poorly\
    \ defined charters\n      are a major factor in poor quality and/or late deliveries\
    \ from\n      some WGs and the total failure of other WGs.\n   o  The IETF needs\
    \ to avoid focusing on a too-narrow scope of\n      technology because this would\
    \ be likely to blinker the IETF's view\n      of 'the good of the Internet', and\
    \ will harm the long-term goal of\n      making the Internet useful to the greatest\
    \ number stakeholders;\n      this argues for allowing a relatively wide range\
    \ of topics to be\n      worked on in the IETF - cross-fertilization has always\
    \ been one of\n      the IETF's strengths.\n   An additional barrier to achieving\
    \ a common understanding is that the\n   IETF does not have a recognized forum\
    \ in which all stakeholders\n   participate and in which organization wide consensus\
    \ might be\n   reached.  Plenary meetings during regular IETF meetings allow a\
    \ large\n   cross-section of the community to offer views, but there is not\n\
    \   generally sufficient time to achieve consensus and there is no single\n  \
    \ mailing list which all stakeholders can be guaranteed to monitor.\n   The IETF\
    \ creates standards and is therefore necessarily a Standards\n   Development Organization\
    \ (SDO), but many participants would like to\n   differentiate the IETF and its\
    \ way of working from the 'conventional'\n   SDOs which emphasize corporate involvement\
    \ and mandated delegates.\n   Externally, the IETF is often classified with these\
    \ conventional\n   SDOs, especially by detractors, because the differentiation\
    \ in the\n   IETF's mission and processes and the rationale for those differences\n\
    \   are not clear.  This can lead to the IETF being misunderstood by\n   other\
    \ SDOs which can make communications between SDOs less effective,\n   harming\
    \ the IETF's ability to achieve its mission.\n"
- title: 2.2.  The IETF does not Consistently use Effective Engineering Practices
  contents:
  - "2.2.  The IETF does not Consistently use Effective Engineering Practices\n  \
    \ For an organization with 'engineering' in its title and participants\n   who\
    \ are likely to trot out the statement \"Trust me, I'm an engineer!\"\n   when\
    \ confronted with the need to find a solution to a particularly\n   knotty problem,\
    \ the IETF has, at least in some cases, extremely\n   ineffective engineering\
    \ practices.  Effective engineering practices,\n   as used here, covers both the\
    \ techniques used to derive and verify\n   the technical solutions needed, and\
    \ the management and organizational\n   strategies that are commonly accepted\
    \ to help with the engineering\n   process.\n   A major symptom of this lack is\
    \ that WGs do not consistently produce\n   timely, high-quality, and predictable\
    \ output.  As discussed in\n   Section 2.1, this problem is exacerbated because\
    \ the IETF currently\n   finds it difficult to determine what is timely, and hence\
    \ what are\n   appropriate deadlines for the delivery of WG output.  Some of the\n\
    \   contributing problems which interfere with effective engineering in\n   WGs\
    \ include:\n   o  Failure to ensure that there is a uniform view in the WG of\
    \ the\n      scope of the WG activity, especially the intended purpose of the\n\
    \      solution.\n   o  Failure to identify the issues that need to be resolved\
    \ at an\n      early stage (before the design is frozen), and/or then to ensure\n\
    \      that there is a uniform view in the WG of the issues that need to\n   \
    \   be resolved to bring the work to a satisfactory conclusion.\n   o  Failure\
    \ to identify and articulate engineering trade-offs that may\n      be needed\
    \ to meet the deadlines that the WG has set without\n      inappropriately reducing\
    \ the 'fitness for purpose' for the\n      intended customers.\n   o  Continued\
    \ refinement of the solution beyond the point at which it\n      is adequate to\
    \ meet the requirements placed on it by the intended\n      purpose.\n   The IETF\
    \ standards engineering process is not set up to deliver\n   iterative process\
    \ improvement.  Particular areas that need\n   improvement include:\n   o  The\
    \ charter may not be sufficiently detailed to document the\n      process and\
    \ timeline to be followed by the WG.  Additional\n      documents may be needed,\
    \ such as a roadmap or detailed plans.\n   o  Poorly defined success criteria\
    \ for WGs and individual documents.\n   o  Lack of written guidelines or templates\
    \ for the content of\n      documents (as opposed to the overall layout) and matching\
    \ lists of\n      review criteria designed to achieve appropriate quality in output.\n\
    \   o  Lack of auditing against explicit criteria throughout the\n      standards\
    \ development process.\n   o  Lack of review, especially early review, by reviewers\
    \ who are not\n      directly interested members of the WG, and by subject matter\n\
    \      experts for topics related to, but not necessarily the immediate\n    \
    \  focus of the document.\n   o  Lack of documentation about likely problem areas\
    \ that might arise\n      due to interactions with other popular IETF protocols.\n\
    \   o  Lack of metrics to measure the achievement of the desired quality\n   \
    \   and the performance of both WGs and the whole IETF.\n   o  Lack of metrics\
    \ and 'post mortem' procedures to drive the\n      improvement of the standards\
    \ development and other IETF processes.\n   o  Lack of criteria for determining\
    \ when a piece of work is\n      overrunning and/or is unlikely to be concluded\
    \ successfully,\n      either at all or within an acceptable time frame.  Lack\
    \ of process\n      for extending the time frame, adjusting the scope, or terminating\n\
    \      the work item or the whole Working Group.\n   o  Automated tools to support\
    \ the engineering process are minimal.\n   o  Despite its commitment to 'running\
    \ code', the IETF is not\n      proactive in providing ways for developers to\
    \ verify their\n      implementations of IETF standards.\n   In addition, IETF\
    \ processes, and Working Group processes in\n   particular, suffer because commonly\
    \ accepted Project Management\n   techniques are not regularly applied to the\
    \ progress of work in the\n   organization.\n   o  Project entry, goal setting,\
    \ dependency identification,\n      coordination, and tracking processes are all\
    \ either missing or\n      implemented less effectively than the norm for commercial\n\
    \      organizations in related activities.  Dependencies and\n      coordination\
    \ should cover both other WGs within the IETF and any\n      outside SDO with\
    \ which the IETF is collaborating.\n   o  Charters regularly fail to set enough\
    \ milestones with sufficiently\n      small granularity at which progress of WGs,\
    \ individuals, and\n      documents can be evaluated.  Also, WGs often do not\
    \ make more\n      detailed work plans to refine the charter plans.\n   o  The\
    \ acceptable deadlines for finishing a piece of work, and the\n      criteria\
    \ used to determine them, are rarely, if ever, documented.\n      Also, the estimated\
    \ time required to complete the work often\n      differs widely from the time\
    \ actually taken.  The combination of\n      these factors makes determining the\
    \ feasibility of delivering\n      within the required time frame, and then adjusting\
    \ the scope of\n      the work to fit the time frame requirements, extremely difficult.\n\
    \   One problem which the IETF does not appear to suffer from is\n   excessive\
    \ bureaucracy, in the sense that transfer of information is\n   generally kept\
    \ to the minimum necessary to accomplish the task.  It\n   is important that any\
    \ changes introduced do not significantly\n   increase the bureaucratic load whilst\
    \ still recording sufficient\n   information to allow process improvement.\n \
    \  Finally, even where the IETF does have Engineering Practices defined,\n   there\
    \ are frequently cases where they are ignored or distorted.  One\n   area of particular\
    \ concern is the tendency for protocols to be\n   assessed and issues resolved\
    \ primarily through static analysis of the\n   written specification rather than\
    \ by practical experiment with\n   'running code'.\n"
- title: 2.3.  The IETF has Difficulty Handling Large and/or Complex Problems
  contents:
  - "2.3.  The IETF has Difficulty Handling Large and/or Complex Problems\n   The\
    \ IETF has historically been most successful when dealing with\n   tightly focused\
    \ problems that have few interactions with other parts\n   of the total problem\
    \ solution.  Given that the Internet has become\n   more complex, such tightly\
    \ focused problems are becoming the\n   exception.  The IETF does not always seem\
    \ to be aware of the\n   interactions between protocols that are bound to be thrown\
    \ up by\n   deployment in more complex situations and so fails to minimize the\n\
    \   chances of unwelcome consequences arising unforeseen when a new\n   protocol\
    \ is deployed.  This may be exacerbated by inadequate review\n   from outside\
    \ the WG as suggested in Section 2.2.\n   IETF standardization procedures are\
    \ optimized for tightly constrained\n   working groups and are generally less\

    \ solution.  Engineering\n   in the large can encompass many aspects of system\
    \ design including:\n      Architecture\n      Frameworks\n      Security\n  \
    \    Internationalization\n   The IETF has historically standardized protocol\
    \ components rather\n   than complete systems, but as we have learned more about\
    \ the ways in\n   which systems on the Internet interact, design of components\
    \ needs to\n   take into account more and more external constraints, and the\n\
    \   understanding of these constraints tends to require more engineering\n   in\
    \ the large.\n   Part of the cause of this difficulty may be that the formal reporting\n\
    \   structure of the IETF emphasizes communication between the Internet\n   Engineering\
    \ Steering Group (IESG) through the ADs and the WGs, and\n   does not place much\
    \ reliance on inter-WG communications:\n   o  The IETF is not consistently effective\
    \ at resolving issues that\n      cross WG or area boundaries.\n   o  The IETF\
    \ does not possess effective formal mechanisms for inter-WG\n      cooperation,\
    \ coordination, or communication, including the\n      handling of dependencies\
    \ between deliverables and processes\n      specified in WG charters.\n   o  The\
    \ IETF does not have an effective means for defining\n      architectures and\
    \ frameworks that will shape the work of multiple\n      WGs.\n   The IETF also\
    \ has to work with other SDOs, and the liaison mechanisms\n   for coordination\
    \ and cooperation do not always work efficiently.\n   This needs to be remedied\
    \ because some of the interactions which IETF\n   work has to take into account\
    \ will involve protocols and systems\n   standardized by these other SDOs.\n \
    \  A possible consequence of the need for more engineering in the large\n   is\
    \ that protocol specifications have become larger: as a result they\n   now take\
    \ longer to develop.  Some people perceive that this is\n   because the IESG has\
    \ tended to require protocol specifications to\n   specify an entire system, instead\
    \ of simple component protocols,\n   leading to feature bloat and applicability\
    \ only to a narrow range of\n   applications (see also Section 2.4).  On the other\
    \ hand, others\n   believe that the IESG has approved simple component protocols\
    \ without\n   an adequate understanding of the systems and contexts in which the\n\
    \   protocols might be used.  These problems appear to be two additional\n   aspects\
    \ of the general problem that the IETF has with handling large\n   and/or complex\
    \ systems.\n"

  - "2.4.  Three Stage Standards Hierarchy not properly Utilized\n   The current hierarchy\
    \ of Proposed, Draft, and Full Standard maturity\n   levels for specifications\
    \ is no longer being used in the way that was\n   envisioned when the stratification\
    \ was originally proposed.  In\n   practice, the IETF currently has a one-step\
    \ standards process that\n   subverts the IETF's preference for demonstrating\
    \ effectiveness\n   through running code in multiple interoperable implementations.\
    \  This\n   compresses the process that previously allowed specifications to\n\
    \   mature as experience was gained with actual implementations:\n   o  Relatively\
    \ few specifications are now progressed beyond Proposed\n      Standard (PS) to\
    \ Draft Standard (DS) level, and even fewer to Full\n      Standard (FS).\n  \
    \ o  It is widely perceived that the IESG has 'raised the (quality)\n      bar'\
    \ that standards have to pass to be accorded a PS status.\n      Protocol developers\
    \ may be required to specify a complete system\n      rather than an interface\
    \ in order for their specification to be\n      approved as a PS (see also Section\
    \ 2.3).\n   o  In spite of the apparently higher quality hurdle, implementation\n\
    \      or deployment experience is still not required, so the IETF's\n      guiding\
    \ principle of 'rough consensus and running code' has less\n      of a chance\
    \ to be effective.\n   o  There appears to be a vicious circle in operation where\
    \ vendors\n      tend to deploy protocols that have reached PS as if they were\n\
    \      ready for full production, rather than accepting that standards at\n  \
    \    the PS level are still under development and could be expected to\n     \
    \ be altered after feature, performance, and interoperability tests\n      in\
    \ limited pilot installations, as was originally intended.  The\n      enthusiasm\
    \ of vendors to achieve a rapid time to market seems to\n      have encouraged\
    \ the IETF in general and the IESG in particular to\n      attempt to ensure that\
    \ specifications at PS are ready for prime\n      time, and that subsequent modifications\
    \ will be minimal as it\n      progresses to DS and FS, assuming effort can be\
    \ found to create\n      the necessary applicability and interoperability reports\
    \ that are\n      needed.\n   o  The three stage hierarchy is, accordingly, seen\
    \ to be excessive.\n   o  There is no formal bug reporting or tracking system\
    \ in place for\n      IETF specifications.\n   o  The periodic review of protocols\
    \ at PS and DS levels specified in\n      [1] are not being carried out, allowing\
    \ protocols to persist in\n      these lower maturity levels for extended periods\
    \ of time, whereas\n      the process would normally expect them to progress or\
    \ be relegated\n      to Historic status.\n   o  No individual or body is given\
    \ the task of 'maintaining' a\n      specification after the original WG has closed\
    \ down.\n      Specifications are generally only updated when a need for a new\n\
    \      version is perceived.  No attempt is normally made to correct bugs\n  \
    \    in the specification (whether they affect operation or not) and\n      the\
    \ specification is not updated to reflect parts of the\n      specification that\
    \ have fallen into disuse or were, in fact, never\n      implemented.  This is,\
    \ in part, because the current procedures\n      would require a standard to revert\
    \ to the PS maturity level, even\n      when specification maintenance is carried\
    \ out.  This occurs even\n      if the changes can be demonstrated to have no\
    \ or minimal effect on\n      an existing protocol at the DS or FS level.\n"

    \ the workload imposed\n   on each of the ADs is almost certainly well beyond\
    \ the capabilities\n   of a single person.\n   The current job description for\
    \ an AD encompasses at least the\n   following tasks:\n   o  Interacting with\
    \ WGs\n   o  Understanding network and computer technology in general, and\n \
    \     their own area in detail\n   o  Cross-pollinating between groups\n   o \

    \ team\n   o  Effectively providing technical management, people-management, and\n\
    \      project supervision for their WGs\n   o  Reading (or at least skimming)\
    \ every formal document which the\n      IETF produces, and having an opinion\
    \ on all of them, as well as\n      all the Internet Drafts produced by the WGs\
    \ in the area, and\n      understanding the interactions between all these specifications.\n\
    \   Given the number of WGs which are now active, the increasing\n   complexity\
    \ of both the work being undertaken and the technology in\n   general, together\

    \ can be expected to do this job well.\n   To make matters worse, these tasks\
    \ are, in theory, a 'part time'\n   occupation.  ADs will normally have a conventional\
    \ job, with the IETF\n   activities as just one part of their job specification.\
    \  This view\n   has been reinforced by recent resignations from the IESG, citing\
    \ the\n   size of the workload as a primary factor.  The IETF also has no\n  \
    \ mechanisms to nominate a temporary replacement or an assistant should\n   an\
    \ AD be incapacitated wholly or partially for a period.\n   The malign effects\
    \ of this overload include:\n   o  Wear on the IESG:  The IESG members are overworked\
    \ which is bad\n      for their health, humor, and home life, and may also result\
    \ in\n      conflicts with their employers if the IETF work impacts the IESG\n\
    \      member's performance of their 'day job'.\n   o  Unhappiness in the IETF:\
    \  IETF stakeholders perceive that IESG\n      members are responding slowly,\
    \ are not fully up-to-date with their\n      technology, fail to pro-actively\
    \ manage problems in their WGs, and\n      are unable to keep communication channels\
    \ with other groups open.\n   o  Recruiting shrinkage: The number of people who\
    \ can imagine taking\n      on an IESG post is steadily decreasing.  It is largely\
    \ limited to\n      people who work for large companies who can afford to send\
    \ IESG\n      members to the IETF for the duration of their appointments.  In\n\
    \      the current business climate, fewer companies are able to justify\n   \
    \   the preemption of an important engineering and business resource\n      for\

    \ of years, successive IETF Nominating Committees\n   have chosen to give heavy\
    \ weighting to continuity of IESG and IAB\n   membership.  Thus, the IETF appeared\
    \ to have created an affinity\n   group system which tended to re-select the same\
    \ leaders from a\n   limited pool of people who had proved competent and committed\
    \ in the\n   past.\n   Members of this affinity group tend to talk more freely\
    \ to each other\n   and former members of the affinity group - this may be because\
    \ the\n   affinity group has also come to share a cultural outlook which\n   matches\
    \ the dominant cultural ethos of the IETF (North American,\n   English speaking).\
    \  Newcomers to the organization and others outside\n   the affinity group are\
    \ reluctant to challenge the apparent authority\n   of the extended affinity group\
    \ during debates and consequently\n   influence remains concentrated in a relatively\
    \ small group of people.\n   This reluctance may also be exacerbated if participants\
    \ come from a\n   different cultural background than the dominant one.  Such\n\
    \   participants also tend to find it more difficult to follow the rapid\n   and\
    \ colloquial speaking style of native English speakers, and may\n   consequently\
    \ be effectively excluded from the discussion, even if\n   maximum assistance\
    \ is available by such means as real time Jabber\n   logs and extensive text on\
    \ presentation slides.  Even on mailing\n   lists, people from other cultures\
    \ may be reluctant to be as\n   forthright as is often the case in discussions\
    \ between North\n   Americans; also, a person whose first language is not English\
    \ may be\n   daunted by the volume of mail that can occur on some mailing lists\n\
    \   and the use of colloquialisms or euphemisms may cause\n   misunderstandings\
    \ if correspondents are not aware of the problem.\n   A further instance of the\
    \ problems of concentration of influence\n   potentially occurs when, from time\
    \ to time, ADs have acted as WG\n   chairs: conflict of interest might well arise\
    \ in discussions between\n   the IESG and any WG with an AD as its chair.  Whilst\
    \ care is usually\n   taken to have a newly selected AD vacate any WG chair positions\
    \ which\n   might be held in his or her own area, the conflict can arise on the\n\
    \   occasions when an AD has been used as the chair of a WG because it is\n  \
    \ clearly the right (or only possible) solution for the WG from an\n   engineering\
    \ and know-how position.  Furthermore, given the known\n   problem of workload\
    \ for IESG members, there must be doubts as to\n   whether an AD can or ought\
    \ to be taking on this extra load.\n"
- title: 2.6.7.  Excessive Reliance on Personal Relationships
  contents:
  - "2.6.7.  Excessive Reliance on Personal Relationships\n   The IETF is an intensely\
    \ personal and individualistic organization.\n   Its fundamental structure is\
    \ based on individuals as actors, rather\n   than countries, organizations, or\
    \ companies as in most other SDOs.\n   This is also reflected in how the IETF\
    \ gets its work done: the NOMCOM\n   process, the WG Chair selection processes,\
    \ and the activities of WGs\n   are all reliant on personal knowledge of the capabilities\
    \ of other\n   individuals and an understanding built on experience of what they\
    \ can\n   be expected to deliver, given that there are almost no sanctions that\n\
    \   can be applied beyond not asking them to do a similar task again.\n   The\
    \ relationship works best when it is two way - the person being\n   asked to perform\
    \ a task needs to be able to rely on the behavior of\n   the person doing the\
    \ asking.\n   In essence, the IETF is built on a particular kind of one-to-one\n\
    \   personal trust relationship.  This is a very powerful model but it\n   does\
    \ not scale well because this trust is not transitive.  Just\n   because you trust\
    \ one person, it does not mean that you trust (i.e.,\n   know the capabilities\
    \ of and can rely on) all the people that person\n   trusts in turn.\n   The disruption\
    \ caused when one set of relationships has to be\n   replaced by another is clearest\
    \ when an AD is replaced.  The IETF\n   does not keep personnel records or written\
    \ plans, and formal process\n   documentation is very sparse, so that incoming\
    \ ADs have little\n   information on which to base new relationships with WG chairs\
    \ or\n   Directorate members not already known to them.\n   A new AD has to build\
    \ or bring along his or her set of trusted\n   individuals.  The AD will tend\
    \ to prefer individuals from this set as\n   WG chairs, unless there is a suitable\
    \ outsider who was part of the\n   team that brought the WG idea to the IETF.\
    \  This tends to limit the\n   AD's field of choice, particularly when asking\
    \ for a 'stabilizing',\n   'advising', or 'process' chair to work with an enthusiastic\
    \ newcomer\n   in a difficult area.  A breakdown of an established relationship\n\
    \   (such as between an AD and a WG chair) can be very damaging to the\n   work\
    \ of the IETF, and it may not be immediately obvious to outsiders.\n   Another\
    \ consequence of the reliance on personal relationships is that\n   the IETF has\
    \ very little institutional 'memory' outside the memories\n   of the people in\
    \ the process at a given time.  This makes it more\n   likely that failures will\
    \ be repeated and makes process improvement\n   more difficult (see Section 2.2).\n"

    \ to be adhered to during the remainder of a\n   process or until shown to be\
    \ incorrect.\n   The problems documented in this section are probably consequences\
    \ of\n   the non-hierarchical organization of the IETF and the volunteer\n   status\
    \ of most participants.  The enforcement measures available in a\n   more conventional\
    \ hierarchical corporate environment are mostly not\n   available here, and it\
    \ is unlikely that application of some well-\n   known procedure or practice will\
    \ fix these problems.\n   Participants are frequently allowed to re-open previously\
    \ closed\n   issues just to replay parts of the previous discussion without\n\
    \   introducing new material.  This may be either because the decision\n   has\
    \ not been clearly documented, or it may be a maneuver to try to\n   get a decision\
    \ changed because the participant did not concur with\n   the consensus originally.\
    \  In either case, revisiting decisions stops\n   the process from moving forward,\
    \ and in the worst cases, can\n   completely derail a working group.  On the other\
    \ hand, the decision\n   making process must allow discussions to be re-opened\
    \ if significant\n   new information comes to light or additional experience is\
    \ gained\n   which appears to justify alternative conclusions for a closed issue.\n\
    \   One cause that can lead to legitimate attempts to re-open an\n   apparently\
    \ closed issue is the occurrence of 'consensus by\n   exhaustion'.  The consensus\
    \ process can be subverted by off-topic or\n   overly dogmatic mail storms which\
    \ can lead to the exclusion of\n   knowledgeable participants who are unable to\
    \ devote the time needed\n   to counter the mail storm.  The consequence may be\
    \ an\n   unrepresentative and unsatisfactory consensus which will tend to be\n\
    \   re-opened, often leading to repeat discussions.  Mailing lists, which\n  \
    \ are at the heart of the IETF WG process, are becoming increasingly\n   ineffective\
    \ at resolving issues and achieving consensus because of\n   this phenomenon.\n\

  - "2.8.  IETF Participants and Leaders are Inadequately Prepared for\n      their\
    \ Roles\n   Participants and leaders at all levels in the IETF need to be taught\n\
    \   the principles of the organization (Mission and Architecture(s)) and\n   trained\
    \ in carrying out the processes, which they have to use in\n   developing specifications,\
    \ etc.\n   Part of the reason for the lack of training in the principles of the\n\
    \   organization is that there is not currently an explicit formulation\n   of\
    \ these principles that is generally agreed upon by all\n   stakeholders.  Section\
    \ 2.1 identifies that this shortage is a major\n   problem.\n   The IETF currently\
    \ has voluntary and inconsistent processes for\n   educating its participants,\
    \ which may be why significant numbers of\n   participants seem to fail to conform\
    \ to the proper principles when\n   working in the IETF context.\n   The people\
    \ in authority have generally been steeped in the principles\n   of the IETF (as\
    \ they see them) and first-time non-compliance by newer\n   participants is sometimes\
    \ treated as an opportunity for abuse rather\n   than recognition of a training\
    \ failure.\n   The IETF culture of openness also tends to tolerate participants\
    \ who,\n   whilst understanding the principles of the IETF, disagree with them\n\
    \   and actively ignore them.  This can be confusing for newer\n   participants,\
    \ but they need to be made aware that the IETF does not\n   exclude such people.\
    \  The IETF does not currently have a strategy for\n   dealing with the conflicts\
    \ that can result from participants who\n   disagree with the principles of the\
    \ organization.\n   Lack of training, compounded with the perceived concentration\
    \ of\n   influence in the affinity group documented in Section 2.6.6, can lead\n\
    \   to newcomers being ignored during discussions, consequently being\n   ineffective,\
    \ either in their own eyes or their employers.  This may\n   result in their departure\
    \ from the IETF.\n   In addition, some participants are not aware of the problems\
    \ that\n   participants, who do not have English as their first language, may\n\
    \   have with rapid speaking and the use of colloquialisms in both spoken\n  \
    \ and written communication.  They are also not always aware of the\n   possible\
    \ cultural nuances that may make full participation more\n   difficult for those\
    \ who do not share the same outlook.\n"

    \ <margaret@thingmagic.com>\n   Special thanks are due to Margaret Wasserman for\
    \ extensive reviewing\n   of and contributions to the wording of Section 2.\n\
    \   The early part of the reduction of the problem statement mailing list\n  \
    \ input was done by Harald Alvestrand and the latter part by Elwyn\n   Davies\
    \ and the team acknowledged above.  In total, there were\n   approximately 750\
    \ extensive and thoughtful contributions (some making\n   several points).  The\
    \ thread was started by a call for volunteers in\n   helping draft a problem statement,\
    \ but quickly turned into a\n   discussion of what the problems were.\n   In addition\
    \ to the editorial team, the following people have provided\n   additional input\
    \ and useful feedback on earlier versions of this\n   document: Harald Alvestrand,\
