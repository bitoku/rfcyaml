  - "               IMP/IMP Teletype Communication\n        I have occasionally found\
    \ myself in a situatuation in\nWhich I see a message from site X on my IMP teletype,\
    \ but I don't\nknow the time and date of the message.\n        I find this annoying,\
    \ since a response to it may be in order\nif it is (say) less than an hour old,\
    \ but not if it is several hours\nold. The situation is not improved by the existence\
    \ of sites that\nnow span all time zones of the U.S. and do not have direct voice\n\
    connection.\n        It is requested that everyone tag their IMP to IMP tele-\n\
    type messages that cause no response at the receiving IMP.\n        The transmitting\
    \ IMP site should use 24 hour time and include\nthe time zone designation.\n \
