  - "1.  Introduction\n   The FITS file format [FITS] was designed in order to facilitate\
    \ the\n   interchange of astronomical image data between observatories.  FITS\n\
    \   provides a means of transporting arrays and tables of data and\n   keyword/value\
    \ pairs of metadata.  FITS is defined by standards\n   documents that are approved\
    \ by the International Astronomical Union\n   (IAU, http://www.iau.org/) and published\
    \ in refereed journals.\n   Before the inception of HTTP, astronomers used the\
    \ Internet to\n   exchange FITS files.  Multiple unofficial media types for FITS\
    \ files\n   [ASU] came into use shortly after the inception of the WWW and have\n\
    \   remained in use.  Currently (2005) the international astronomical\n   community\
    \ is pursuing many cooperative efforts (e.g., [IVOA], [NVO],\n   [AstroGrid],\
    \ [AVO]) to produce web services that provide astronomical\n   data.  The exchange\
    \ of FITS files is a fundamental element of the\n   prototypes for these web services\
    \ [SIAP].  The astronomical community\n   has to agree to use one set of media\
    \ types for FITS files in order to\n   promote interoperability of its various\
    \ services.\n   In its simplest form, FITS is used as a means of transporting\n\
    \   astronomical image data in a raster form along with coordinate\n   information\
    \ and other standard and locally defined metadata.  In such\n   applications FITS\
    \ is much like the well-known TIFF format [TIFF] with\n   the addition of the\
    \ GeoTIFF tags [GeoTIFF].  However, FITS is capable\n   of describing a much broader\
    \ range of data than 2-dimensional\n   rasters.  A consensus has developed in\
    \ the FITS community that two\n   media types are needed:  one for images and\
    \ one for all other cases.\n"

  contents:
  - "4.  FITS Definition\n   FITS is defined by a document approved by the International\n\
    \   Astronomical Union (IAU) and published in the journal Astronomy &\n   Astrophysics\
    \ [NOST].  Conventions for additional keywords used in\n   FITS files are proposed\
    \ by interested parties and negotiated and\n   reviewed by ad hoc committees of\
    \ the FITS community.  If such usage\n   of additional keywords is approved by\
    \ national committees and the\n   IAUFWG then they become new reserved keywords\
    \ in the FITS standard\n   and are published in an ongoing series of papers (e.g.,\
    \ [WCS1,\n   WCS2]).\n   Copies of the standard documents can be found at the\

- title: 4.1.  FITS Structure
  contents:
  - "4.1.  FITS Structure\n   A FITS file consists of a sequence of one or more header\
    \ and data\n   units (HDUs) optionally followed by special records.  The structure\n\
    \   of a FITS file is based on blocks with a length of 2880 8-bit bytes\n   (23040\
    \ bits).  This size was chosen because it is evenly divisible by\n   the byte\
    \ and word lengths of all known computer systems.  All FITS\n   files have lengths\
    \ that are integral multiples of this block size.\n   Each FITS header consists\
    \ of a sequence of one or more 2880-byte\n   blocks that hold 36 80-character\
    \ records (36*80=2880).  The records\n   consist of ASCII keyword/value pairs\
    \ plus optional comments.  The\n   character set is the 7-bit printing ASCII codes,\
    \ including the ASCII\n   space.  In particular, the control codes CR, LF, FF,\
    \ TAB and NUL are\n   not used in FITS headers.  The keywords are up to 8 characters\
    \ in\n   length.  Some keywords are mandatory, and their meaning is rigidly\n\
    \   prescribed.  Among these are keywords that describe the structure and\n  \
    \ size of the subsequent data array.  The standard reserves other\n   keywords\
    \ for the purpose of conveying specifically defined items of\n   metadata.  Keywords\
    \ that are neither mandatory nor reserved may be\n   inserted with semantics that\
    \ are defined by local conventions.  (Some\n   local conventions have later been\
    \ adopted into standardized\n   practice.)  The end of the header is signified\
    \ by a block containing\n   the keyword \"END\".  A simple example of a FITS header\
    \ for a digital\n   image, using only keywords that were specified in the initial\
    \ FITS\n   Agreement of March 1979 [FITS], is as follows:\n            1     \
    \    2         3         4         5         6\n   1234567890123456789012345678901234567890123456789012345678901234567..\n\
    \   SIMPLE  =                    T / file does conform to FITS standard\n   BITPIX\
    \  =                   16 / 16-bit twos-complement pixel values\n   NAXIS   =\
    \                    2 / 2-dimensional image\n   NAXIS1  =                  512\
    \ / first axis length\n   NAXIS2  =                  512 / second axis length\n\
    \   COMMENT  -----------------------------------------------------\n   COMMENT\
    \   FITS (Flexible Image Transport System) format is defined\n   COMMENT   in\
    \ 'Astronomy and Astrophysics', volume 376, page 359;\n   COMMENT   bibcode: 2001A&A...376..359H\n\
    \   COMMENT  -----------------------------------------------------\n   ORIGIN\
    \  = 'Lick Observatory   ' /\n   DATE    = '2003-11-22T05:23:45' / when this file\
    \ was written\n   END\n   (These 13 records are followed by 23 80-character records\
    \ of ASCII\n   spaces, to pad the header block to the 2880-byte FITS block size.)\n\
    \   The first keyword/value pair, SIMPLE=T, is the signature of FITS; all\n  \
    \ FITS files begin with these characters.  BITPIX is the second keyword\n   of\
    \ all FITS files; legal values for it are 8, 16, 32, -32 and -64.\n   NAXIS is\
    \ the third keyword of all FITS files; legal values for it are\n   0 to 999. \
    \ NAXIS=0 is legal, and implies that there is no image data\n   matrix associated\
    \ with the header (and the NAXISi keywords must not\n   be present); this value\
    \ is common for files that will be given the\n   media type \"application/fits\"\
    \ as discussed in section 5.1 of this\n   document.  NAXIS=2 is the value most\
    \ often used for files that will\n   be given the media type \"image/fits\", as\
    \ discussed in section 5.2 of\n   this document (NAXIS=3 FITS images are also\
    \ common).  The COMMENT\n   records will be ignored by FITS reading software,\
    \ but are used here\n   to specify the precise journal citation for the FITS standard,\
    \ an\n   item of information that is important for archiving on timescales of\n\
    \   decades.  The ORIGIN keyword is commonly used in FITS files to encode\n  \
    \ the name of the institution where the file was produced.  The DATE\n   keyword\
    \ is used to convey the timestamp for the file (whereas the\n   keyword DATE-OBS\
    \ is used to convey observation start times).  FITS\n   headers commonly contain\
    \ a vast variety of additional keywords used\n   to encode metadata.  In particular,\
    \ a digital image header will often\n   include keywords to specify the precise\
    \ celestial coordinates of the\n   pixels of the 2-D matrix, with conventions\
    \ that became part of the\n   FITS standard in 2002 (see [WCS2]).  Finally, the\
    \ above example\n   demonstrates how, in addition to the COMMENT records, 60%\
    \ of the\n   bytes in keyword=value records in FITS headers are reserved for\n\
    \   comments.  Although the simple header example above is contained in\n   only\
    \ one FITS block, multi-block FITS headers are commonly\n   interchanged.\n  \
    \ Following each header is a data unit that consists of a sequence of\n   zero\
    \ or more 2880-byte blocks.  In accordance with the description in\n   the keywords\
    \ of their header, these blocks contain an N-dimensional\n   data array, optionally\
    \ followed by other small groups of array data.\n   In most cases, the data array\
    \ represents either an N-dimensional\n   array of image pixel values or a 2-dimensional\
    \ array of tabular data.\n   Following the HDUs a FITS file may contain zero or\
    \ more 2880-byte\n   blocks of special records.  The standard does not specify\
    \ anything\n   about their content.  (This convention for special records is not\n\
    \   known to have been used for any purpose other than prototyping new\n   elements\
    \ of the standard, such as random groups and BINTABLE.)\n   The initial HDU in\
    \ a FITS file is known as the primary HDU (PHDU);\n   any subsequent HDU is known\
    \ as an extension HDU (XHDU).  The keyword\n   content of the PHDU is distinct\
    \ (a PHDU requires a slight alteration\n   before it can become an XHDU, and most\
    \ types of XHDU cannot become a\n   PHDU).  A PHDU may have a data array consisting\
    \ of zero elements, and\n   this will often be the case for FITS files intended\
    \ to communicate\n   tables and multiple images.  An XHDU may be one of several\
    \ standard\n   types, or it may be another conforming type.  Standard types of\
    \ XHDU\n   include \"IMAGE\" (containing an N-dimensional data array similar in\n\
    \   most respects to the PHDU), \"TABLE\" (containing a 2-dimensional table\n\
    \   of ASCII character data), and \"BINTABLE\" (containing a 2-dimensional\n \
    \  table of binary data whose elements may themselves be multi-\n   dimensional\
    \ arrays).\n"

- title: 4.3.  Stability of the FITS Definition
  contents:
  - "4.3.  Stability of the FITS Definition\n   After the adoption of FITS by the\
    \ IAU in 1982, some in the emerging\n   community of FITS users realized that\
    \ there would be tension between\n   the need for archival stability and the need\
    \ for evolution.  In order\n   to satisfy both of these requirements they set\
    \ up a controlled\n   parliamentary process.  At the time of the Generalized Extensions\n\
    \   Agreement [XTENSION], the meta-agreement that controls the evolution\n   of\
    \ FITS, the FITS community adopted the guiding principle \"Once FITS,\n   always\
    \ FITS\".  Under this rule, no change may be made to FITS that\n   invalidates\
    \ existing files.  Changes to the FITS standard occur only\n   after action by\
    \ the IAU FITS Working Group (FWG).  The FWG acts only\n   after approval by regional\
    \ working groups that coordinate FITS\n   activity in various parts of the world.\n\
    \   FITS has been adopted as the archival format for image data and\n   interferometric\
    \ data obtained by many ground-based observatories and\n   for all data from many\
    \ spacecraft.  Many astrophysical archives store\n   their data in FITS format,\
    \ and most astronomical catalog data has\n   been transcribed into FITS files.\
    \  The many terabytes of data in\n   these archives contribute to the stability\
    \ of the FITS standard.\n"
- title: 4.4.  Portability of FITS files
  contents:
  - "4.4.  Portability of FITS files\n   Eric Greisen, one of the authors of the original\
    \ document [FITS],\n   relates that in 1979\n      [t]he first FITS files were\
    \ written by a PL/I program on an IBM\n      360 under OS/MFT (32-bit, twos-complement\
    \ numbers and 8-bit EBCDIC\n      characters) and were read by a Fortran program\
    \ executing on a CDC\n      6400 under SCOPE (60-bit, ones-complement numbers\
    \ and 6-bit\n      \"Display Code\" characters).  [Remark]\n   Subsequent evolution\
    \ of computing hardware and FITS over 25 years has\n   not degraded this ability\
    \ to transfer the data content.\n   The structure of FITS files is extremely general,\
    \ and this\n   necessarily complements the nature of astronomical data.  FITS\
    \ is\n   used to store observations of the entire electromagnetic spectrum\n \
    \  from radio to gamma rays, from ground-based observatories and from\n   spacecraft.\
    \  FITS is also used to communicate physical properties\n   other than radiation\
    \ intensity; these may be inferred from\n   observations or calculated by theoretical\
    \ models.  The pedigree of\n   data in a FITS file typically varies among disciplines;\
    \ FITS may be\n   used to store raw and uncalibrated data, completely reduced\
    \ and\n   calibrated data, or both.  Nevertheless, the FITS standard provides\n\
    \   that the syntactic content of the data and metadata are unambiguously\n  \
    \ available to posterity.\n   Observatories have developed numerous local conventions\
    \ for the\n   storage and transfer of data peculiar to their instrumentation and\n\
    \   purview.  Application software for handling FITS files from different\n  \
    \ regions of the electromagnetic spectrum has been largely disjoint.\n   For a\
    \ FITS file that consists of multiple HDUs there are no widely\n   established\
    \ conventions governing the meaning of, interrelations\n   between, and suggested\
    \ use of the data sets.  Recognition of any\n   local conventions used for FITS\
    \ data has often been based on\n   heuristics of the additional (non-standard)\
    \ keyword/value pairs.\n   Fully understanding the semantic content of a FITS\
    \ file usually\n   requires an external data dictionary.\n"

  - "5.  IANA Considerations\n   The general nature of the full FITS standard requires\
    \ the use of the\n   media type \"application/fits\".  Nevertheless, the principal\
    \ intent\n   for a great many FITS files is to convey a single data array in the\n\
    \   PHDU, and such arrays are very often 2-dimensional images.  Several\n   common\
    \ image viewing applications already display single-HDU FITS\n   files, and the\
    \ prototypes for virtual observatory projects specify\n   that data provided by\
    \ web services be conveyed by the data array in\n   the PHDU.  These uses justify\
    \ the registration of a second media\n   type, namely \"image/fits\", for files\
    \ which use the subset of the\n   standard described by the original FITS standard\
    \ paper [FITS].\n   We note that the media type \"image/gif\" [MIME2] admits raster\
    \ images\n   that are three dimensional, because animated GIF images contain two\n\
    \   spatial dimensions and one temporal dimension.  We note that the\n   media\
    \ types \"image/vnd.dwg\" and \"image/vnd.dxf\" admit data that\n   include three-dimensional\
    \ vectors and curves as well as objects\n   created by using constructive solid\
    \ geometry.  Following these\n   precedents for the \"image\" media type, we specify\
    \ that \"image/fits\"\n   MAY be used to describe FITS PHDUs that have other than\
    \ two\n   dimensions.  We expect that most files described as \"image/fits\" will\n\
    \   have two-dimensional (NAXIS=2) PHDUs.\n"

    \  As such, the current\n   standard FITS keywords do not pose security risks.\n\
    \   A FITS file author may insert additional keywords with semantics that\n  \
    \ are not described by the standard.  Parties exchanging FITS files may\n   employ\
    \ locally defined conventions that use various keywords and\n   their values to\
    \ induce actions on the part of the recipient.  There\n   are existing local conventions\

    \ At the present time many of these applications are not designed to\n   support\
    \ use as viewers of \"application/fits\" files in association\n   with web browsers.\n\
    \   Additional information:\n   A FITS file described with the media type \"application/fits\"\
    \ SHOULD\n   conform to the published standards for FITS files as determined by\n\
    \   convention and agreement within the international FITS community.  No\n  \
    \ other constraints are placed on the content of a file described as\n   \"application/fits\"\
    .\n   A FITS file described with the media type \"application/fits\" may have\n\
    \   an arbitrary number of conforming extension header and data units\n   (XHDUs)\
    \ that follow its mandatory primary header and data unit\n   (PHDU).  The XHDUs\
    \ may be one of the standard types (\"IMAGE\",\n   \"TABLE\", and \"BINTABLE\"\
    ) or any other type that satisfies the\n   \"Requirements for Conforming Extensions\"\
    \ (section 4.4.1 of [NOST]).\n   The PHDU or any \"IMAGE\" XHDU may contain zero\
    \ to 999 dimensions with\n   zero or more pixels along each dimension.\n   The\
    \ PHDU may use the random groups convention, in which the dimension\n   of the\
    \ first axis is zero and the keywords GROUPS, PCOUNT and GCOUNT\n   appear in\
    \ the header.  NAXIS1=0 and GROUPS=T is the signature of\n   random groups; see\
    \ section 7 of the Definition of FITS paper [NOST].\n   Recommendations for application\
    \ writers:\n   An application intended to handle \"application/fits\" SHOULD be\
    \ able\n   to provide a user with a manifest of all of the HDUs that are present\n\
    \   in the file and with all of the keyword/value pairs from each of the\n   HDUs.\n\
    \   An application intended to handle \"application/fits\" SHOULD be\n   prepared\
    \ to encounter XHDUs that contain either ASCII or binary\n   tables, and to provide\
    \ a user with access to their elements.\n   An application which can modify FITS\
    \ files or retrieve FITS files\n   from an external service SHOULD be capable\
    \ of writing such files to a\n   local storage medium.\n   Complete interpretation\
    \ of the meaning and intended use of the data\n   in each of the HDUs typically\
    \ requires the use of heuristics that\n   attempt to ascertain which local conventions\
    \ were used by the author\n   of the FITS file.\n   As examples, files with media\
    \ type \"application/fits\" might contain\n   any of the following contents:\n\
    \   - An empty PHDU (containing zero data elements) followed by a table\n    \
    \ HDU that contains a catalog of celestial objects.\n   - An empty PHDU followed\
    \ by a table HDU that encodes a series of\n     time-tagged photon events from\
    \ an exposure using an X-ray detector.\n   - An empty PHDU followed by a series\
    \ of IMAGE HDUs containing data\n     from an exposure taken by a mosaic of CCD\
    \ detectors.\n   - An empty PHDU followed by a series of table HDUs that contain\
    \ a\n     snapshot of the state of a relational database.\n   - A PHDU containing\
    \ a single image along with keyword/value pairs of\n     metadata.\n   - A PHDU\
    \ with NAXIS1=0 and GROUPS=T followed by random groups data\n     records of complex\
    \ fringe visibilities\n   Magic number(s): \"SIMPLE  =                    T\"\n\
    \   Jeff Uphoff of the National Radio Astronomy Observatory (NRAO) has\n   contributed\
    \ database entries for the magic number file which is used\n   by the Unix \"\
    file\" command.  Magic number files with these entries\n   are distributed with\
    \ a variety of Unix-like operating systems.  In\n   addition to recognizing a\
    \ FITS file using the string given above, the\n   Uphoff entries also recognize\
    \ the data type of the pixels in the\n   PHDU.\n   File extension(s): fits\n \
    \  This file extension SHOULD NOT be interpreted as a prescription.\n   The FITS\
    \ standard originated in the era when files were stored and\n   exchanged via\
    \ magnetic tape; it does not prescribe any nomenclature\n   for files on disk.\
    \  Various sites within the FITS community have\n   long-established practices\
    \ where files are presumed to be FITS by\n   context.  File extensions used at\
    \ such sites commonly indicate\n   content of the file instead of the data format.\n\
    \   In the absence of other information it is reasonably safe to presume\n   that\
    \ a file name ending in \".fits\" is intended to be a FITS file.\n   Nevertheless,\
    \ there are other commonly used extensions; e.g., \".fit\",\n   \".fts\", and\

    \ the NAXIS and NAXISn keywords,\n   and hence SHOULD contain at least one pixel.\
    \  Files with 4 or more\n   non-degenerate axes (NAXISn>1) SHOULD be described\
    \ as\n   \"application/fits\", not as \"image/fits\".  (In rare cases it may be\n\
    \   appropriate to describe a NULL image -- a dataless container for FITS\n  \
    \ keywords, with NAXIS=0 or NAXISn=0 -- or an image with 4+ non-\n   degenerate\
    \ axes as \"image/fits\" but this usage is discouraged because\n   such files\
    \ may confuse simple image viewer applications.)\n   FITS files declared as \"\
    image/fits\" MAY also have one or more\n   conforming XHDUs following their PHDUs.\
    \  These extension HDUs MAY\n   contain standard, non-linear, world coordinate\
    \ system (WCS)\n   information in the form of tables or images.  The extension\
    \ HDUs MAY\n   also contain other, non-standard metadata pertaining to the image\
    \ in\n   the PHDU in the forms of keywords and tables.\n   A FITS file described\
    \ with the media type \"image/fits\" SHOULD be\n   principally intended to communicate\
    \ the single data array in the\n   PHDU.  This means that \"image/fits\" SHOULD\
    \ NOT be applied to FITS\n   files containing MEF (multi-exposure-frame) mosaic\
    \ images.  Also,\n   random groups files MUST be described as \"application/fits\"\
    \ and not\n   as \"image/fits\".\n   A FITS file described with the media type\
    \ \"image/fits\" is also valid\n   as a file of media type \"application/fits\"\
    .  The choice of\n   classification depends on the context and intended usage.\n\
    \   Recommendations for application writers:\n   An application that is intended\
    \ to handle \"image/fits\" SHOULD be able\n   to provide a user with a manifest\
    \ of all of the HDUs that are present\n   in the file and with all of the keyword/value\
    \ pairs from each of the\n   HDUs.  An application writer MAY choose to ignore\
    \ HDUs beyond the\n   PHDU, but even in this case the application SHOULD be able\
    \ to present\n   the user with the keyword/value pairs from the PHDU.\n   Note\
    \ that an application intended to render \"image/fits\" for viewing\n   by a user\
    \ has significantly more responsibility than an application\n   intended to handle,\
    \ e.g., \"image/tiff\" or \"image/gif\".  FITS data\n   arrays contain elements\
    \ which typically represent the values of a\n   physical quantity at some coordinate\
    \ location.  Consequently they\n   need not contain any pixel rendering information\
    \ in the form of\n   transfer functions, and there is no mechanism for color look-up\n\
    \   tables.  An application SHOULD provide this functionality, either\n   statically\
    \ using a more or less sophisticated algorithm, or\n   interactively allowing\
    \ a user various degrees of choice.\n   Furthermore, the elements in a FITS data\
    \ array may be integers or\n   floating-point numbers.  The dynamic range of the\
    \ data array values\n   may exceed that of the display medium and the eye, and\
    \ their\n   distribution may be highly nonuniform.  Logarithmic, square-root,\
    \ and\n   quadratic transfer functions along with histogram equalization\n   techniques\
    \ have proved helpful for rendering FITS data arrays.  Some\n   elements of the\
    \ array may have values which indicate that their data\n   are undefined or invalid;\
    \ these should be rendered distinctly.  Via\n   WCS Paper I [WCS1] the standard\
    \ permits \"CTYPEnnn = 'COMPLEX'\" to\n   assert that a data array contains complex\
    \ numbers (future revisions\n   might admit other elements such as quaternions\
    \ or general tensors).\n   Three-dimensional data arrays (NAXIS=3 with NAXIS1,\
    \ NAXIS2 and NAXIS3\n   > 1) are of special interest.  Applications intended to\
    \ handle\n   \"image/fits\" MAY default to displaying the first 2D plane of such\
    \ an\n   image cube, or they MAY default to presenting such an image in a\n  \
    \ fashion akin to that used for an animated GIF, or they MAY present\n   the data\
    \ cube as a mosaic of \"thumbnail\" images.  Even in the absence\n   of WCS indication\
    \ of a temporal axis the time-lapse movie-looping\n   display technique can be\
    \ effective, and application writers SHOULD\n   consider offering it for all three-dimensional\
    \ arrays.\n   An \"image/fits\" PHDU with NAXIS=1 is describing a one-dimensional\n\
    \   entity such as a spectrum or a time series.  Applications intended to\n  \
    \ handle \"image/fits\" MAY default to displaying such an image as a\n   graphical\
    \ plot rather than as a two-dimensional picture with a single\n   row.\n   An\
    \ application that cannot handle an image with dimensionality other\n   than 2\
    \ SHOULD gracefully indicate its limitations to its users when\n   it encounters\
    \ NAXIS=1 or NAXIS=3 cases, while still providing access\n   to the keyword/value\
    \ pairs.\n   FITS files with degenerate axes (i.e., one or more NAXISn=1) MAY\
    \ be\n   described as \"image/fits\", but the first axes SHOULD be non-\n   degenerate\
    \ (i.e., the degenerate axes SHOULD be the highest\n   dimensions).  An algorithm\
    \ designed to render only two-dimensional\n   images will be capable of displaying\
    \ such an NAXIS=3 or NAXIS=4 FITS\n   array that has one or two of the axes consisting\
    \ of a single pixel,\n   and an application writer SHOULD consider coding this\
    \ capability into\n   the application.  Writers of new applications which generate\
    \ FITS\n   files intended to be described as \"image/fits\" SHOULD consider using\n\
    \   the WCSAXES keyword [WCS1] to declare the dimensionality of such\n   degenerate\
    \ axes, so that NAXIS can be used to convey the number of\n   non-degenerate axes.\n\
