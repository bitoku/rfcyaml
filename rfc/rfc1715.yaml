- title: 1. Efficiency of address assignment
  contents:
  - "1. Efficiency of address assignment\n   A substantial part of the \"IPng\" debate\
    \ was devoted to the choice of\n   an address size. A recurring concept was that\
    \ of \"assignment\n   efficiency\", which most people involved in the discussion\
    \ expressed\n   as a the ratio of the effective number of systems in the network\
    \ over\n   the theoretical maximum. For example, the 32 bits IP addressing plan\n\
    \   could in theory number over 7 billions of systems; as of today, we\n   have\
    \ about 3.5 millions of addresses reported in the DNS, which would\n   translate\
    \ in an efficiency of 0.05%.\n   But this classic evaluation is misleading, as\
    \ it does not take into\n   account the number of hierarchical elements. IP addresses,\
    \ for\n   example, have at least three degrees of hierarchy: network, subnet\n\
    \   and host.  In order to remove these dependencies, I propose to use a\n   logarithmic\
    \ scale for the efficiency ratio:\n                             log (number of\
    \ objects)\n                         H = -----------------------\n           \
    \                       available bits\n   The ratio H is not too dependent of\
    \ the number of hierarchical\n   levels. Suppose for example that we have the\
    \ choice between two\n   levels, encoded on 8 bits each, and one single level,\
    \ encoded in 16\n   bits. We will obtain the same efficiency if we allocate in\
    \ average\n   100 elements at each 8 bits level, or simply 10000 elements in the\n\
    \   single 16 bits level.\n   Note that I use base 10 logs in what follows, because\
    \ they are easier\n   to compute mentally. When it comes to large numbers, people\
    \ tend to\n   use \"powers of 10\", as in \"IPng should be capable of numbering\
    \ 1 E+15\n   systems\". It follows from this choice of units that H varies between\n\
    \   0 and a theoretical maximum of 0.30103 (log base 10 of 2).\n"

  - "2. Estimating reasonable values for the ratio H:\n   Indeed, we don't expect\
    \ to achieve a ratio of 0.3 in practice, and\n   the interesting question is to\
    \ assert the values which can be\n   reasonably expected. We can try to evaluate\
    \ them from existing\n   numbering plans. What is especially interesting is to\
    \ consider the\n   moment where the plans broke, i.e. when people were forced\
    \ to add\n   digits to phone number, or to add bits to computer addresses. I have\n\
    \   a number of such figures handy, e.g.:\n   * Adding one digit to all French\
    \ telephone numbers, moving from 8\n     digits to 9, when the number of phones\
    \ reached a threshold of 1.0\n     E+7. The log value is 7, the number of bits\
    \ was about 27 (1 decimal\n     digit is about 3.3 bits). The ratio is thus 0.26\n\
    \   * Expending the number of areas in the US telephone system, making it\n  \
    \   effectively 10 digits long, for about 1.0 E+8 subscribers. The log\n     value\
    \ is 8, the number of bits is 33, the ratio is about 0.24\n   * Expending the\
    \ size of the Internet addresses, from 32 bits to\n     something else. There\
    \ are currently about 3 million hosts on the\n     net, for 32 bits. The log of\
    \ 3.E6 is about 6.5; this gives a ratio\n     of 0.20. Indeed, we believe that\
    \ 32 bits will still be enough for\n     some years, e.g. to multiply the number\
    \ of hosts by 10, in which\n     case the ratio would climb to 0.23\n   * Expending\
    \ the size of the SITA 7 characters address. According to\n     their documentation,\
    \ they have about 64000 addressed points in\n     their network, scattered in\
    \ 1200 cities, 180 countries. An upper\n     case character provides about 5 bits\
    \ of addressing, which results\n     in an efficiency of 0.14. This is an extreme\
    \ case, as SITA uses\n     fixed length tokens in its hierarchy.\n   * The globally-connected\
    \ physics/space science DECnet (Phase IV)\n     stopped growing at about 15K nodes\
    \ (i.e. new nodes were hidden)\n     which in a 16 bit space gives a ratio of\
    \ 0.26\n   * There are about 200 million IEEE 802 nodes in a 46 bit space, which\n\
    \     gives a ratio of 0.18. That number space, however, is not\n     saturated.\n\
    \   From these examples, we can assert that the efficiency ratio usually\n   lies\
    \ between 0.14 and 0.26.\n"
- title: 3. Evaluating proposed address plans
  contents:
  - "3. Evaluating proposed address plans\n   Using a reverse computation, we get\
    \ the following population counts\n   in the network:\n                    Pessimistic\
    \ (0.14)     Optimistic (0.26)\n      32 bits             3 E+4 (!)          \
    \ 2 E+8\n      64 bits             9 E+8               4 E+16\n      80 bits \
    \          1.6 E+11            2.6 E+27\n     128 bits             8 E+17    \
    \          2 E+33\n   I guess that the figure explains well why some feel that\
    \ 64 bits is\n   \"not enough\" while other feel it is \"sufficient by a large\
    \ margin\":\n   depending of the assignment efficiency, we are either well below\
    \ the\n   target or well above. But there is no question, in my view, that 128\n\
    \   bits is \"more than enough\". Even if we presume the lowest efficiency,\n\
    \   we are still way above the hyperbolic estimate of 1.E+15 Internet\n   hosts.\n\
    \   It is also interesting to note that if we devote 80 bits to the\n   \"network\"\
    \ and use 48 bits for \"server less autoconfiguration\", we can\n   number more\
    \ that E.11 networks in the pessimistic case - it would\n   only take an efficiency\
    \ of 0.15 to reach the E+12 networks hyperbole.\n   I guess this explains well\
    \ why I feel that 128 bits is entirely safe\n   for the next 30 year. The level\
    \ of constraints that we will have to\n   incorporate in the address assignment\
    \ appears very much in line with\n   what we know how to do, today.\n"
