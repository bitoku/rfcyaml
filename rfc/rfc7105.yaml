  - "Abstract\n   This document describes a protocol for a Device to provide location-\n\
    \   related measurement data to a Location Information Server (LIS)\n   within\
    \ a request for location information.  Location-related\n   measurement information\
    \ provides observations concerning properties\n   related to the position of a\

    \ data to improve the\n   accuracy of the location estimate it provides to the\
    \ Device.  A basic\n   set of location-related measurements are defined, including\

- title: 1.  Introduction

  - "1.  Introduction\n   A Location Configuration Protocol (LCP) provides a means\
    \ for a Device\n   to request information about its physical location from an\
    \ access\n   network.  A Location Information Server (LIS) is the server that\n\
    \   provides location information that is available due to the knowledge\n   it\
    \ has about the network and physical environment.\n   As a part of the access\
    \ network, the LIS is able to acquire\n   measurement results related to Device\
    \ location from network elements.\n   The LIS also has access to information about\
    \ the network topology\n   that can be used to turn measurement data into location\
    \ information.\n   This information can be further enhanced with information acquired\n\
    \   from the Device itself.\n   A Device is able to make observations about its\
    \ network attachment,\n   or its physical environment.  The location-related measurement\
    \ data\n   might be unavailable to the LIS; alternatively, the LIS might be able\n\
    \   to acquire the data, but at a higher cost in terms of time or some\n   other\
    \ metric.  Providing measurement data gives the LIS more options\n   in determining\
    \ location; this could in turn improve the quality of\n   the service provided\
    \ by the LIS.  Improvements in accuracy are one\n   potential gain, but improved\
    \ response times and lower error rates are\n   also possible.\n   This document\
    \ describes a means for a Device to report location-\n   related measurement data\
    \ to the LIS.  Examples based on the\n   HTTP-Enabled Location Delivery (HELD)\
    \ [RFC5985] location\n   configuration protocol are provided.\n"

  contents:
  - "2.  Conventions Used in This Document\n   The terms \"LIS\" and \"Device\" are\
    \ used in this document in a manner\n   consistent with the usage in [RFC5985].\n\
    \   This document also uses the following definitions:\n   Location Measurement:\
    \  An observation about the physical properties\n      of a particular Device's\
    \ position in time and space.  The result\n      of a location measurement --\
    \ \"location-related measurement data\",\n      or simply \"measurement data\"\
    \ given sufficient context -- can be\n      used to determine the location of\
    \ a Device.  Location-related\n      measurement data does not directly identify\
    \ a Device, though it\n      could do so indirectly.  Measurement data can change\
    \ with time if\n      the location of the Device also changes.\n      Location-related\
    \ measurement data does not necessarily contain\n      location information directly,\
    \ but it can be used in combination\n      with contextual knowledge and/or algorithms\
    \ to derive location\n      information.  Examples of location-related measurement\
    \ data are\n      radio signal strength or timing measurements, Ethernet switch\n\
    \      identifiers, and port identifiers.\n      Location-related measurement\
    \ data can be considered sighting\n      information, based on the definition\
    \ in [RFC3693].\n   Location Estimate:  An approximation of where the Device is\
    \ located.\n      Location estimates are derived from location measurements.\n\
    \      Location estimates are subject to uncertainty, which arises from\n    \
    \  errors in measurement results.\n   GNSS:  Global Navigation Satellite System.\
    \  A satellite-based system\n      that provides positioning and time information\
    \ -- for example, the\n      US Global Positioning System (GPS) or the European\
    \ Galileo system.\n   The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\"\
    , \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and\
    \ \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].\n"
- title: 3.  Location-Related Measurements in LCPs
  contents:
  - "3.  Location-Related Measurements in LCPs\n   This document defines a standard\
    \ container for the conveyance of\n   location-related measurement parameters\
    \ in location configuration\n   protocols.  This is an XML container that identifies\
    \ parameters by\n   type and allows the Device to provide the results of any measurement\n\
    \   it is able to perform.  A set of measurement schemas are also defined\n  \
    \ that can be carried in the generic container.\n   A simple example of measurement\
    \ data conveyance is illustrated by the\n   example message in Figure 1.  This\
    \ shows a HELD location request\n   message with an Ethernet switch and port measurement\
    \ taken using the\n   Link-Layer Discovery Protocol (LLDP) [IEEE.8021AB].\n  \

    \           Figure 1: HELD Location Request with Measurement Data\n   This LIS\
    \ can ignore measurement data that it does not support or\n   understand.  The\
    \ measurements defined in this document follow this\n   rule: extensions that\
    \ could result in backward incompatibility MUST\n   be added as new measurement\
    \ definitions rather than extensions to\n   existing types.\n   Multiple sets\
    \ of measurement data, either of the same type or from\n   different sources,\
    \ can be included in the \"measurements\" element.\n   See Section 4.1.1 for details\
    \ on repetition of this element.\n   A LIS can choose to use or ignore location-related\
    \ measurement data\n   in determining location, as long as rules regarding use\
    \ and retention\n   (Section 6) are respected.  The \"method\" parameter in the\
    \ Presence\n   Information Data Format - Location Object (PIDF-LO) [RFC4119] SHOULD\n\
    \   be adjusted to reflect the method used.  A correct \"method\" can\n   assist\
    \ location recipients in assessing the quality (both accuracy\n   and integrity)\
    \ of location information, though there could be reasons\n   to withhold information\
    \ about the source of data.\n   Measurement data is typically only used to serve\
    \ the request in which\n   it is included.  There may be exceptions, particularly\
    \ with respect\n   to location URIs.  Section 6 provides more information on usage\n\
    \   rules.\n   Location-related measurement data need not be provided exclusively\
    \ by\n   Devices.  A third-party location requester (for example, see\n   [RFC6155])\
    \ can request location information using measurement data,\n   if the requester\
    \ is able to acquire measurement data and authorized\n   to distribute it.  There\
    \ are specific privacy considerations relating\n   to the use of measurements\
    \ by third parties, which are discussed in\n   Section 6.4.\n   Location-related\
    \ measurement data and its use present a number of\n   privacy and security challenges.\
    \  These are described in more detail\n   in Sections 6 and 7.\n"

  contents:
  - "4.1.  Measurement Container\n   The \"measurements\" element is used to encapsulate\
    \ measurement data\n   that is collected at a certain point in time.  It contains\
    \ time-based\n   attributes that are common to all forms of measurement data,\
    \ and it\n   permits the inclusion of arbitrary measurement data.  The elements\n\

- title: 4.1.1.  Time of Measurement
  contents:
  - "4.1.1.  Time of Measurement\n   The \"time\" attribute records the time that\
    \ the measurement or\n   observation was made.  This time can be different from\
    \ the time that\n   the measurement information was reported.  Time information\
    \ can be\n   used to populate a timestamp on the location result or to determine\n\
    \   if the measurement information is used.\n   The \"time\" attribute SHOULD\
    \ be provided whenever possible.  This\n   allows a LIS to avoid selecting an\
    \ arbitrary timestamp.  Exceptions\n   to this, where omitting time might make\
    \ sense, include relatively\n   static types of measurement (for instance, the\
    \ DSL measurements in\n   Section 5.6) or for legacy Devices that don't record\
    \ time information\n   (such as the Home Location Register/Home Subscriber Server\
    \ for\n   cellular).\n   The \"time\" attribute is attached to the root \"measurement\"\
    \ element.\n   Multiple measurements can often be given the same timestamp, even\n\
    \   when the measurements were not actually taken at the same time\n   (consider\
    \ a set of measurements taken sequentially, where the\n   difference in time between\
    \ observations is not significant).\n   Measurements cannot be grouped if they\
    \ have different types or if\n   there is a need for independent time values on\
    \ each measurement.  In\n   these instances, multiple measurement sets are necessary.\n"
- title: 4.1.2.  Expiry Time on Location-Related Measurement Data
  contents:
  - "4.1.2.  Expiry Time on Location-Related Measurement Data\n   A Device is able\
    \ to indicate an expiry time in the location\n   measurement using the \"expires\"\
    \ attribute.  Nominally, this attribute\n   indicates how long information is\
    \ expected to be valid, but it can\n   also indicate a time limit on the retention\
    \ and use of the\n   measurement data.  A Device can use this attribute to request\
    \ that\n   the LIS not retain measurement data beyond the indicated time.\n  \
    \    Note: Movement of the Device might result in the measurement data\n     \
    \ being invalidated before the expiry time.\n   A Device is advised to set the\
    \ \"expires\" attribute to the earlier of\n   the time that measurements are likely\
    \ to be unusable and the time\n   that it desires to have measurements discarded\
    \ by the LIS.  A Device\n   that does not desire measurement data to be retained\
    \ can omit the\n   \"expires\" attribute.  Section 6 describes more specific rules\n\
    \   regarding measurement data retention.\n"
- title: 4.2.  RMS Error and Number of Samples
  contents:
  - "4.2.  RMS Error and Number of Samples\n   Often a measurement is taken more than\
    \ once.  Reporting the average\n   of a number of measurement results mitigates\
    \ the effects of random\n   errors that occur in the measurement process.\n  \
    \ Reporting each measurement individually can be the most effective\n   method\
    \ of reporting multiple measurements.  This is achieved by\n   providing multiple\
    \ measurement elements for different times.\n   The alternative is to aggregate\
    \ multiple measurements and report a\n   mean value across the set of measurements.\
    \  Additional information\n   about the distribution of the results can be useful\
    \ in determining\n   location uncertainty.\n   Two attributes are provided for\
    \ use on some measurement values:\n   rmsError:  The root-mean-squared (RMS) error\
    \ of the set of\n      measurement values used in calculating the result.  RMS\
    \ error is\n      expressed in the same units as the measurement, unless otherwise\n\
    \      stated.  If an accurate value for the RMS error is not known, this\n  \
    \    value can be used to indicate an upper bound or estimate for the\n      RMS\
    \ error.\n   samples:  The number of samples that were taken in determining the\n\
    \      measurement value.  If omitted, this value can be assumed to be\n     \
    \ large enough that the RMS error is an indication of the standard\n      deviation\
    \ of the sample set.\n   For some measurement techniques, measurement error is\
    \ largely\n   dependent on the measurement technique employed.  In these cases,\n\

    \ such case where a\n   small error in time can result in a large error in location.\
    \  Factors\n   such as clock drift and errors in time synchronization can result\
    \ in\n   small, but significant, time errors.  Including an indication of the\n\
    \   quality of time measurements can be helpful.\n   A \"timeError\" attribute\
    \ MAY be added to the \"measurement\" element to\n   indicate the RMS error in\
    \ time.  \"timeError\" indicates an upper bound\n   on the time RMS error in seconds.\n\
    \   The \"timeError\" attribute does not apply where multiple samples of a\n \

- title: 4.3.  Measurement Request
  contents:
  - "4.3.  Measurement Request\n   A measurement request is used by a protocol peer\
    \ to describe a set of\n   measurement data that it desires.  A \"measurementRequest\"\
    \ element is\n   defined that can be included in a protocol exchange.\n   For\
    \ instance, a LIS can use a measurement request in HELD responses.\n   If the\
    \ LIS is unable to provide location information, but it believes\n   that a particular\
    \ measurement type would enable it to provide a\n   location, it can include a\
    \ measurement request in an error response.\n   The \"measurement\" element of\
    \ the measurement request identifies the\n   type of measurement that is requested.\
    \  The \"type\" attribute of this\n   element indicates the type of measurement,\
    \ as identified by an XML\n   qualified name.  A \"samples\" attribute MAY be\
    \ used to indicate how\n   many samples of the identified measurement are requested.\n\
    \   The \"measurement\" element can be repeated to request multiple (or\n   alternative)\
    \ measurement types.\n   Additional XML content might be defined for a particular\
    \ measurement\n   type that is used to further refine a request.  These elements\
    \ either\n   constrain what is requested or specify non-mandatory components of\n\
    \   the measurement data that are needed.  These are defined along with\n   the\
    \ specific measurement type.\n   In the HELD protocol, the inclusion of a measurement\
    \ request in an\n   error response with a code of \"locationUnknown\" indicates\
    \ that\n   providing measurements would increase the likelihood of a subsequent\n\
    \   request being successful.\n   The following example shows a HELD error response\
    \ that indicates that\n   WiFi measurement data would be useful if a later request\
    \ were made.\n   Additional elements indicate that received signal strength for\
    \ an\n   802.11n access point is requested.\n     <error xmlns=\"urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:geopriv:held\"\

    \ time of\n      arrival (TOA) of signal at a receiving station, as defined in\n\

    \ synchronize their clocks.  This value can be measured by an access\n      point\
    \ or Device; because the flight time is assumed to be the same\n      in either\
    \ direction -- aside from measurement errors -- only a\n      single element is\

  - "5.4.  Cellular Measurements\n   Cellular Devices are common throughout the world,\
    \ and base station\n   identifiers can provide a good source of coarse location\
    \ information.\n   Cellular measurements can be provided to a LIS run by the cellular\n\
    \   operator, or may be provided to an alternative LIS operator that has\n   access\
    \ to one of several global cell-id to location mapping\n   databases.\n   A number\
    \ of advanced location determination methods have been\n   developed for cellular\
    \ networks.  For these methods, a range of\n   measurement parameters can be collected\
    \ by the network, Device, or\n   both in cooperation.  This document includes\
    \ a basic identifier for\n   the wireless transmitter only; future efforts might\
    \ define additional\n   parameters that enable more accurate methods of location\n\

- title: 5.5.  GNSS Measurements
  contents:
  - "5.5.  GNSS Measurements\n   A Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) uses\
    \ orbiting satellites\n   to transmit signals.  A Device with a GNSS receiver\
    \ is able to take\n   measurements from the satellite signals.  The results of\
    \ these\n   measurements can be used to determine time and the location of the\n\
    \   Device.\n   Determining location and time in autonomous GNSS receivers follows\n\
    \   three steps:\n   Signal acquisition:  During the signal acquisition stage,\
    \ the\n      receiver searches for the repeating code that is sent by each GNSS\n\
    \      satellite.  Successful operation typically requires measurement\n     \
    \ data for a minimum of 5 satellites.  At this stage, measurement\n      data\
    \ is available to the Device.\n   Navigation message decode:  Once the signal\
    \ has been acquired, the\n      receiver then receives information about the configuration\
    \ of the\n      satellite constellation.  This information is broadcast by each\n\
    \      satellite and is modulated with the base signal at a low rate; for\n  \
    \    instance, GPS sends this information at about 50 bits per second.\n   Calculation:\
    \  The measurement data is combined with the data on the\n      satellite constellation\
    \ to determine the location of the receiver\n      and the current time.\n   A\
    \ Device that uses a GNSS receiver is able to report measurements\n   after the\
    \ first stage of this process.  A LIS can use the results of\n   these measurements\
    \ to determine a location.  In the case where there\n   are fewer results available\
    \ than the optimal minimum, the LIS might\n   be able to use other sources of\
    \ measurement information and combine\n   these with the available measurement\
    \ data to determine a position.\n      Note: The use of different sets of GNSS\
    \ assistance data can reduce\n      the amount of time required for the signal\
    \ acquisition stage and\n      obviate the need for the receiver to extract data\
    \ on the satellite\n      constellation.  Provision of assistance data is outside\

    \ policy that allows a\n   requester to obtain their own location.  HELD identity\
    \ extensions\n   [RFC6155] allow other entities to be authorized, conditional\
    \ on a\n   Rule Maker providing sufficient authorization.\n   The intent of these\
    \ protections is to ensure that a location\n   recipient is authorized to acquire\
    \ location information.  Location-\n   related measurement data could be used\
    \ by an attacker to circumvent\n   such authorization checks if the association\
    \ between measurement data\n   and Target Device is not validated by a LIS.\n\
    \   A LIS can be coerced into providing location information for a Device\n  \
    \ that a location recipient is not authorized to receive.  A request\n   identifies\
    \ one Device (implicitly or explicitly), but measurement\n   data is provided\

    \   By using unverified measurement data to generate a response, the LIS\n   provides\
    \ information about a Device without appropriate\n   authorization.\n   The feasibility\
    \ of this attack depends on the availability of\n   information that links a Device\
    \ with measurement data.  In some\n   cases, measurement data that is correlated\
    \ with a Target is readily\n   available.  For instance, LLDP measurements (Section\
    \ 5.1) are\n   broadcast to all nodes on the same network segment.  An attacker\
    \ on\n   that network segment can easily gain measurement data that relates a\n\
    \   Device with measurements.\n   For some types of measurement data, it's necessary\
    \ for an attacker to\n   know the location of the Target in order to determine\
    \ what\n   measurements to use.  This attack is meaningless for types of\n   measurement\
    \ data that require that the attacker first know the\n   location of the Target\
    \ before measurement data can be acquired or\n   fabricated.  GNSS measurements\

    \  For instance, GNSS measurements are easy to\n   use for this purpose because\

    \   then any location information that is derived from this data can be\n   indirectly\
    \ influenced.\n   Altering the environment in this fashion might not require\n\
    \   involvement with either a Device or LIS.  Measurement that is passive\n  \
    \ -- where the Device observes a signal or other phenomenon without\n   direct\
    \ interaction -- is most susceptible to alteration by third\n   parties.\n   Measurement\
    \ of radio signal characteristics is especially vulnerable,\n   since an adversary\
    \ need only be in the general vicinity of the Device\n   and be able to transmit\
    \ a signal.  For instance, a GNSS spoofer is\n   able to produce fake signals\
    \ that claim to be transmitted by any\n   satellite or set of satellites (see\
    \ [GPS.SPOOF]).\n   Measurements that require direct interaction increase the\

    \ be on the communications path (that is, man in the middle).\n   Even if the\
    \ entity that is interacted with is authenticated, this\n   does not provide any\
    \ assurance about the integrity of measurement\n   data.  For instance, the Device\

    \   to be able to understand the signal content.\n      Note: This particular\
    \ \"attack\" is more often completely\n      legitimate.  Radio repeaters are\
    \ a commonplace mechanism used to\n      increase radio coverage.\n   Attacks\
    \ that rely on altering the observed environment of a Device\n   require countermeasures\
    \ that affect the measurement process.  For\n   radio signals, countermeasures\
    \ could include the use of authenticated\n   signals, or altered receiver design.\
    \  In general, countermeasures are\n   highly specific to the individual measurement\
    \ process.  An exhaustive\n   discussion of these issues is left to the relevant\
    \ literature for\n   each measurement technology.\n   A Device that provides measurement\
    \ data is assumed to be responsible\n   for applying appropriate countermeasures\
    \ against this type of attack.\n   Where a Device is the sole recipient of location\
    \ information derived\n   from measurement data, a LIS might choose to provide\
    \ location\n   information without any validation.  The responsibility for ensuring\n\

  contents:
  - "7.2.2.2.  Limitations\n   The trusted location that is used for validation is\
    \ always less\n   accurate than the location that is being checked.  The amount\
    \ by\n   which the untrusted location is more accurate, is the same amount\n \
    \  that an attacker can exploit.\n   For example, a trusted location might indicate\
    \ an uncertainty region\n   with a radius of five kilometers.  An untrusted location\
    \ that\n   describes a 100-meter uncertainty within the larger region might be\n\
    \   accepted as more accurate.  An attacker might still falsify\n   measurement\
    \ data to select any location within the larger uncertainty\n   region.  While\
    \ the 100-meter uncertainty that is reported seems more\n   accurate, a falsified\
    \ location could be anywhere in the\n   five-kilometer region.\n   Where measurement\
    \ data might have been falsified, the actual\n   uncertainty is effectively much\
    \ higher.  Local policy might allow\n   differing degrees of trust to location\

- title: 7.2.3.  Supporting Observations
  contents:
  - "7.2.3.  Supporting Observations\n   Replay attacks using previously acquired\
    \ measurement data are\n   particularly hard to detect without independent validation.\
    \  Rather\n   than validate the measurement data directly, supplementary data\
    \ might\n   be used to validate measurements or the location information derived\n\
    \   from those measurements.\n   These supporting observations could be used to\
    \ convey information\n   that provides additional assurance that measurement data\
    \ from the\n   Device was acquired at a specific time and place.  In effect, the\n\
    \   Device is requested to provide proof of its presence at the resulting\n  \
    \ location.\n   For instance, a Device that measures attributes of a radio signal\n\
    \   could also be asked to provide a sample of the measured radio signal.\n  \
    \ If the LIS is able to observe the same signal, the two observations\n   could\
    \ be compared.  Providing that the signal cannot be predicted in\n   advance by\
    \ the Device, this could be used to support the claim that\n   the Device is able\
    \ to receive the signal.  Thus, the Device is likely\n   to be within the range\
    \ that the signal is transmitted.  A LIS could\n   use this to attribute a higher\
    \ level of trust in the associated\n   measurement data or resulting location.\n"
- title: 7.2.3.1.  Effectiveness
  contents:
  - "7.2.3.1.  Effectiveness\n   The use of supporting observations is limited by\
    \ the ability of the\n   LIS to acquire and validate these observations.  The\
    \ advantage of\n   selecting observations independent of measurement data is that\n\
    \   observations can be selected based on how readily available the data\n   is\
    \ for both LIS and Device.  The amount and quality of the data can\n   be selected\
    \ based on the degree of assurance that is desired.\n   The use of supporting\
    \ observations is similar to both measurement\n   validation and location validation.\
    \  All three methods rely on\n   independent validation of one or more properties.\
    \  The applicability\n   of each method is similar.\n   The use of supporting\

- title: 7.2.3.2.  Limitations
  contents:
  - "7.2.3.2.  Limitations\n   The effectiveness of the validation method depends\

    \ how\n   difficult it is to guess, and what other costs might be involved in\n\
    \   acquiring this data.\n   In the example of an observed radio signal, requesting\
    \ a sample of\n   the signal only provides an assurance that the Device is able\

    \  This only provides some assurance that the Device is within range of\n   the\
    \ transmitter.\n   As with location validation, a Device might still be able to\
    \ provide\n   falsified measurements that could alter the value of the location\n\
    \   information as long as the result is within this region.\n   Requesting additional\
    \ supporting observations can reduce the size of\n   the region over which location\
    \ information can be altered by an\n   attacker, or increase trust in the result,\

- title: 7.2.4.  Attribution
  contents:
  - "7.2.4.  Attribution\n   Lying by proxy (Section 7.1.4) relies on the location\
    \ recipient being\n   able to attribute location information to a LIS.  The effectiveness\n\
    \   of this attack is negated if location information is explicitly\n   attributed\
    \ to a particular source.\n   This requires an extension to the location object\
    \ that explicitly\n   identifies the source (or sources) of each item of location\n\
    \   information.\n   Rather than relying on a process that seeks to ensure that\
    \ location\n   information is accurate, this approach instead provides a location\n\
    \   recipient with the information necessary to reach their own\n   conclusion\
    \ about the trustworthiness of the location information.\n   Including an authenticated\
    \ identity for all sources of measurement\n   data presents a number of technical\
    \ and operational challenges.  It\n   is possible that the LIS has a transient\
    \ relationship with a Device.\n   A Device is not expected to share authentication\
    \ information with a\n   LIS.  There is no assurance that Device identification\
    \ is usable by a\n   potential location recipient.  Privacy concerns might also\
    \ prevent\n   the sharing of identification information, even if it were available\n\
    \   and usable.\n   Identifying the type of measurement source allows a location\n\
    \   recipient to make a decision about the trustworthiness of location\n   information\
    \ without depending on having authenticated identity\n   information for each\
    \ source.  An element for this purpose is defined\n   in Section 4.4.\n   When\
    \ including location information that is based on measurement data\n   from sources\
    \ that might be untrusted, a LIS SHOULD include\n   alternative location information\
    \ that is derived from trusted sources\n   of measurement data.  Each item of\
    \ location information can then be\n   labeled with the source of that data.\n\
    \   A location recipient that is able to identify a specific source of\n   measurement\
    \ data (whether it be LIS or Device) can use this\n   information to attribute\
    \ location information to either entity or to\n   both entities.  The location\
    \ recipient is then better able to make\n   decisions about trustworthiness based\
    \ on the source of the data.\n   A location recipient that does not understand\
    \ the \"source\" element is\n   unable to make this distinction.  When constructing\
    \ a PIDF-LO\n   document, trusted location information MUST be placed in the PIDF-LO\n\
    \   so that it is given higher priority to any untrusted location\n   information\
    \ according to Rule #8 of [RFC5491].\n   Attribution of information does nothing\
    \ to address attacks that alter\n   the observed parameters that are used in location\
    \ determination\n   (Section 7.1.6).\n"

    \ Referring to\n   [RFC5226], this registry operates under \"Specification Required\"\
    \n   rules.  The IESG will appoint an Expert Reviewer who will advise IANA\n \
    \  promptly on each request for a new or updated GNSS type.\n   Each entry in\
    \ the registry requires the following information:\n   GNSS Name:  the name of\
    \ the GNSS\n   Brief Description:  a brief description of the GNSS\n   GNSS Token:\
    \  a token that can be used to identify the GNSS\n   Signals:  a set of tokens\
