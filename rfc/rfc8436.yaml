    Services Field Codepoints (DSCP) Registry\n"
  title: __initial_text__
- contents:
  - "Abstract\n   The Differentiated Services (Diffserv) architecture specifies use
    of\n   the DS field in the IPv4 and IPv6 packet headers to carry one of 64\n   distinct
    differentiated services field codepoint (DSCP) values.  The\n   Internet Assigned
    Numbers Authority (IANA) maintains a registry of\n   assigned DSCP values.\n   This
    update to RFC 2474 changes the IANA registration policy for Pool\n   3 of the
    registry (i.e., DSCP values of the form xxxx01) to Standards\n   Action, i.e.,
    values are assigned through a Standards Track or Best\n   Current Practice RFC.
    \ The update also removes permission for\n   experimental and local use of the
    codepoints that form Pool 3 of the\n   DSCP registry; Pool 2 Codepoints (i.e.,
    DSCP values of the form\n   xxxx11) remain available for these purposes.\n"

  - "1.  Introduction\n   The Differentiated Services (Diffserv) [RFC2475] architecture\n
    \  (updated by [RFC3260]) provides scalable service differentiation in\n   the
    Internet.  Diffserv uses the six most significant bits of the\n   former IPv4
    Type of Service (TOS) octet or the former IPv6 Traffic\n   Class octet to convey
    the field, which is used to carry the DSCP.\n   This DSCP value is used to select
    a Diffserv per-hop behavior (PHB).\n   The six-bit field is capable of conveying
    64 distinct codepoints, and\n   this codepoint space has been divided into three
    pools for the\n   purpose of codepoint assignment and management (as shown in\n
    \  Figure 1).  Pool 1 comprises 32 codepoints [RFC2474].  These are\n   assigned
    by Standards Action, as defined in [RFC8126].  Pool 2\n   comprises a pool of
    16 codepoints reserved for Experimental or Local\n   Use (EXP/LU) as defined in
    [RFC2474].  Pool 3 comprises 16\n   codepoints, which were originally specified
    as \"initially available\n   for experimental or local use, but which should be
    preferentially\n   utilized for standardized assignments if Pool 1 is ever exhausted\"
    by\n   [RFC2474].\n                  +------+-----------------+\n                  |
    Pool | Codepoint Space |\n                  +------+-----------------+\n                  |

    1: Format of the Field for Codepoints Allocated in the Three\n            IANA
    Pools (Where \"x\" Refers to Either \"0\" or \"1\")\n   At the time of writing
    this document, 22 of the 32 Pool 1 codepoints\n   have been assigned.\n   Although
    Pool 1 has not yet been completely exhausted, there is a\n   need to assign codepoints
    for particular PHBs that are unable to use\n   any of the unassigned values in
    Pool 1.  This document changes the\n   IANA registration policy of Pool 3 to assignment
    by Standards Action.\n   (Section 4.9 of [RFC8126] defines this as \"assigned
    only through\n   Standards Track or Best Current Practice RFCs in the IETF Stream\".)\n
    \  An example is the need to assign a suitable recommended default\n   codepoint
    for the Lower Effort (LE) PHB [LE-PHB].  The LE PHB is\n   designed to protect
    best-effort (BE) traffic (packets forwarded with\n   the default PHB) from LE
    traffic in congestion situations (when\n   resources become scarce, best-effort
    traffic has precedence over LE\n   traffic and is allowed to preempt it).  In
    deployed networks,\n   bleaching (i.e. intentionally setting to zero) of the IP
    Precedence\n   field continues to be used.  (Setting the IP Precedence field to
    zero\n   disables any class-based flow management by routers configured with\n
    \  TOS-based packet processing.)  This causes the first three bits of\n   the
    former TOS byte (now the upper part of the DSCP field) to become\n   zero.  Therefore,
    there is a need to avoid this remapping of the DSCP\n   for the LE PHB by assigning
    a codepoint that already has a zero value\n   in the first three bits [LE-PHB].\n
    \  Furthermore, if the LE PHB were to have been assigned one of the\n   currently
    unused Pool 1 codepoints with a zero value in the first\n   three bits, any bleaching
    of the IP Precedence field would result in\n   other (higher assurance) traffic
    being also remapped to the assigned\n   DSCP.  This remapping could then cause
    Diffserv-marked traffic to\n   receive an unintentional LE treatment for the remainder
    of the\n   Internet path.  Therefore, it is important to avoid the resulting\n
    \  priority inversion.  The absence of unassigned codepoints in Pool 1\n   that
    exhibit these important properties motivates assigning a Pool 3\n   codepoint
    as the default that is recommended for use with this PHB.\n   To allow the IETF
    to utilize Pool 3 codepoints, this document\n   requests IANA to manage Pool 3
    assignments for DSCP values in Pool 3\n   via the Standards Action policy [RFC8126].\n"

    Services\n   Field Codepoints (DSCP)\" registry and will manage this pool using\n
    \  Standards Action, as defined as Section 4.9 of [RFC8126].\n   IANA has made
    the following changes to the \"Differentiated Services\n   Field Codepoints (DSCP)\"
    registry, made available at [Registry].\n   IANA has referenced RFC 2474 and Section
    4 of RFC 3260 for the\n   overall format of this registry.\n   IANA has referenced
    RFC 2474 and Section 4 of RFC 3260 for Pool 1.\n   This document does not modify
    the IANA registry text for Pool 2.\n   This pool continues to preserve the note
    shown in Figure 2.\n   The previous registry text for Pool 3:\n      3 xxxx01
    Experimental or local use may be utilized for future\n      Standards Action allocations
    as necessary.\n   is replaced with the following registry text:\n      3 xxxx01
    Standards Action.\n   To manage codepoints in Pool 3, IANA has created and will
    maintain\n   the \"DSCP Pool 3 Codepoints\" subregistry.  Pool 3 of the registry
    has\n   been created initially empty, with a format identical to that used\n   for
    \"DSCP Pool 1 Codepoints\".\n   IANA has referenced RFC 2474, Section 4 of RFC
    3260, and the current\n   document for Pool 3.\n   The registration procedure
    for use of Pool 3 is Standards Action, as\n   defined as Section 4.9 of [RFC8126].
    \ IANA is expected to normally\n   make assignments from Pool 1, until this Pool
    is exhausted, but it\n   MAY make assignments from Pool 3 when the format of the
    codepoint has\n   properties that are needed for a specific PHB.  The required\n
    \  characteristics for choosing a requested DSCP value MUST be explained\n   in
    the IANA Considerations section of the document that requests any\n   assignment
    from Pool 3.\n"
