One strategy, called the \"single\nbackslash\" strategy, is based on the historical use of a single\nbackslash ('\\') character to indicate where line-folding has\noccurred, with the continuation occurring with the first character\nthat is not a space character (' ') on the next line.  The second\nstrategy, called the \"double backslash\" strategy, extends the first\nstrategy by adding a second backslash character to identify where the\ncontinuation begins and is thereby able to handle cases not supported\nby the first strategy.  Both strategies use a self-describing header\nenabling automated reconstitution of the original content.","pub_date":"January 1970","keywords":["sourcecode","artwork"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":null,"errata_url":null}
