- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   Several Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) [EAP] authentication\n\
    \   methods employ X.509 public key certificates.  For example, EAP-TLS\n   [EAP-TLS]\
    \ can be used with PPP [PPP] as well as IEEE 802.1X [802.1X].\n   PPP is used\
    \ for dial-up and VPN environments.  IEEE 802.1X defines\n   port-based, network\
    \ access control, and it is used to provide\n   authenticated network access for\
    \ Ethernet, Token Ring, and Wireless\n   LANs (WLANs) [802.11].\n   Automated\
    \ selection of certificates for PPP and IEEE 802.1X clients\n   is highly desirable.\
    \  By using certificate extensions to identify the\n   intended environment for\
    \ a particular certificate, the need for user\n   input is minimized.  Further,\
    \ the certificate extensions facilitate\n   the separation of administrative functions\
    \ associated with\n   certificates used for different environments.\n   IEEE 802.1X\
    \ can be used for authentication with multiple networks.\n   For example, the\
    \ same wireless station might use IEEE 802.1X to\n   authenticate to a corporate\
    \ IEEE 802.11 WLAN and a public IEEE 802.11\n   \"hotspot.\"  Each of these IEEE\
    \ 802.11 WLANs has a different network\n   name, called Service Set Identifier\
    \ (SSID).  If the network operators\n   have a roaming agreement, then cross realm\
    \ authentication allows the\n   same certificate to be used on both networks.\
    \  However, if the\n   networks do not have a roaming agreement, then the IEEE\
    \ 802.1X client\n   needs to select a certificate for the current network environment.\n\
    \   Including a list of SSIDs in a certificate extension facilitates\n   automated\
    \ selection of an appropriate X.509 public key certificate\n   without human user\
    \ input.  Alternatively, a companion attribute\n   certificate could contain the\
    \ list of SSIDs.\n"

- title: 2.  EAP Extended Key Usage Values
  contents:
  - "2.  EAP Extended Key Usage Values\n   RFC 3280 [PROFILE] specifies the extended\
    \ key usage X.509 certificate\n   extension.  The extension indicates one or more\
    \ purposes for which\n   the certified public key may be used.  The extended key\
    \ usage\n   extension can be used in conjunction with key usage extension, which\n\
    \   indicates the intended purpose of the certified public key.  For\n   example,\
    \ the key usage extension might indicate that the certified\n   public key ought\
    \ to be used only for validating digital signatures.\n   The extended key usage\
    \ extension definition is repeated here for\n   convenience:\n      id-ce-extKeyUsage\
    \ OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= {id-ce 37}\n      ExtKeyUsageSyntax ::= SEQUENCE SIZE\
    \ (1..MAX) OF KeyPurposeId\n      KeyPurposeId ::= OBJECT IDENTIFIER\n   This\
    \ specification defines two KeyPurposeId values: one for EAP over\n   PPP, and\
    \ one for EAP over LAN (EAPOL).  Inclusion of the EAP over PPP\n   value indicates\
    \ that the certified public key is appropriate for use\n   with EAP in the PPP\
    \ environment, and the inclusion of the EAPOL value\n   indicates that the certified\
    \ public key is appropriate for use with\n   the EAP in the LAN environment. \
    \ Inclusion of both values indicates\n   that the certified public key is appropriate\
    \ for use in either of the\n   environments.\n      id-kp  OBJECT IDENTIFIER \

    \  ::=  { id-kp 13 }\n      id-kp-eapOverLAN  OBJECT IDENTIFIER  ::=  { id-kp\
    \ 14 }\n   The extended key usage extension may, at the option of the\n   certificate\
    \ issuer, be either critical or non-critical.  If the\n   extension is marked\
    \ as critical, then the certified public key MUST\n   be used only for the purposes\
    \ indicated.  However, if the extension\n   is marked as non-critical, then extended\
    \ key usage extension MAY be\n   used to support the location of an appropriate\
    \ certified public key.\n   If a certificate contains both a critical key usage\
    \ extension and a\n   critical extended key usage extension, then both extensions\
    \ MUST be\n   processed independently, and the certificate MUST only be used for\
    \ a\n   purpose consistent with both extensions.  If there is no purpose\n   consistent\
    \ with both critical extensions, then the certificate MUST\n   NOT be used for\
    \ any purpose.\n"

  - "3.  WLAN SSID Public Key Certificate Extension\n   The Wireless LAN (WLAN) System\
    \ Service identifiers (SSIDs) public key\n   certificate extension is always non-critical.\
    \  It contains a list of\n   SSIDs.  When more than one certificate includes an\
    \ extended key usage\n   extension indicating that the certified public key is\
    \ appropriate for\n   use with the EAP in the LAN environment, then the list of\
    \ SSIDs MAY\n   be used to select the correct certificate for authentication in\
    \ a\n   particular WLAN.\n   Since SSID values are unmanaged, the same SSID can\
    \ appear in\n   different certificates that are intended to be used with different\n\
    \   WLANs.  When this occurs, automatic selection of the certificate will\n  \
    \ fail, and the implementation SHOULD obtain help from the user to\n   choose\
    \ the correct certificate.  In cases where a human user is\n   unavailable, each\
    \ potential certificate MAY be tried until one\n   succeeds.  However, by maintaining\
    \ a cache of Access Point (AP) MAC\n   addresses or authentication server identity\
    \ with which the\n   certificate has successfully authenticated, user involvement\
    \ can be\n   minimized.  RADIUS [RADIUS1, RADIUS2] is usually used as the\n  \

- title: 5.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "5.  Security Considerations\n   The procedures and practices employed by the\
    \ certification authority\n   (CA) MUST ensure that the correct values for the\
    \ extended key usage\n   extension and SSID extension are inserted in each certificate\
    \ that is\n   issued.  Relying parties may accept or reject a particular\n   certificate\
    \ for an intended use based on the information provided in\n   these extensions.\
    \  Incorrect representation of the information in\n   either extension could cause\
    \ the relying party to reject an otherwise\n   appropriate certificate or accept\
    \ a certificate that ought to be\n   rejected.\n   If multiple SSIDs are included\
    \ in a certificate, then information can\n   be obtained from a certificate about\
    \ the SSIDs associated with\n   several WLANs, not the WLAN that is currently\
    \ being accessed.  The\n   intended use of the SSID extensions is to help a client\
    \ determine the\n   correct certificate to present when trying to gain access\
    \ to a WLAN.\n   In most situations, including EAP-TLS, the client will have the\n\
    \   opportunity to validate the certificate provided by the server before\n  \
    \ transmitting one of its own certificates to the server.  While the\n   client\
    \ may not be sure that the server has access to the\n   corresponding private\
    \ key until later in the protocol exchange, the\n   identity information in the\
    \ server certificate can be used to\n   determine whether or not the client certificate\
    \ ought to be provided.\n   When the same client certificate is used to authenticate\
    \ to multiple\n   WLANs, the list of SSIDs is available from servers associated\
    \ with\n   each WLAN.  Of course, the list of SSIDs is also made available to\n\
    \   any eavesdroppers on the WLAN.  Whenever this SSID disclosure is a\n   concern,\
    \ different client certificates ought to be used for the each\n   WLAN.\n   SSID\
    \ values are unmanaged; therefore SSIDs may not be unique.  Hence,\n   it is possible\
    \ for client certificates that are intended to be used\n   with different WLANs\
    \ to contain the same SSID.  In this case,\n   automatic selection of the certificate\
    \ will fail, and the\n   implementation SHOULD obtain help from the user to choose\
    \ the correct\n   certificate.  In cases where a human user is unavailable, each\n\
    \   potential certificate MAY be tried until one succeeds, disclosing the\n  \
    \ list of SSIDs associated with each certificate, which might otherwise\n   not\
    \ be disclosed.  Therefore, it is RECOMMENDED that sequentially\n   trying each\
    \ certificate only be employed when user selection is\n   unavailable or impractical.\n\
    \   In practice, disclosure of the SSID is of little concern.  Some WLAN\n   security\
    \ experts recommend that the SSID be masked in the beacon sent\n   out by Access\
    \ Points (APs).  The intent is to make it harder for an\n   attacker to find the\
    \ correct AP to target.  However, other WLAN\n   management messages include the\
    \ SSID, so this practice only forces\n   the attacker to eavesdrop on the WLAN\
    \ management messages instead of\n   the beacon.  Therefore, placing the SSID\
    \ in the certificate does not\n   make matters worse.\n"
