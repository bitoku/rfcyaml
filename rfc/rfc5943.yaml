    \ in\n   intermittent reachability for numerous reasons that are outside the\n\
    \   scope of this document.  In order to aid in the debugging of these\n   persistent\

- title: 2.  RPSL Extension for Diagnostic Address
  contents:
  - "2.  RPSL Extension for Diagnostic Address\n   Network operators wishing to provide\
    \ a diagnostic address for their\n   peers, customers, etc., MAY advertise its\
    \ existence via the Routing\n   Policy Specification Language [RFC4012] [RFC2622].\
    \  The pingable\n   attribute is a member of the route and route6 objects in the\
    \ RPSL.\n   The definition of the pingable attribute is shown in Figure 1.\n \
    \  +-----------+-------------------+--------------+\n   | Attribute |       Value\
    \       |    Type      |\n   +-----------+-------------------+--------------+\n\
    \   |  pingable | <ipv6-address> or |  optional,   |\n   |           | <ipv4-address>\
    \    | multi-valued |\n   +-----------+-------------------+--------------+\n \
    \  |  ping-hdl |   <nic-handle>    |  optional,   |\n   |           |        \
    \           | multi-valued |\n   +-----------+-------------------+--------------+\n\
    \                Figure 1: Pingable Attribute Specification\n   The exact definitions\
    \ of <ipv4-address> and <nic-handle> can be found\n   in [RFC2622], while the\
    \ definition of <ipv6-address> is in [RFC4012].\n   The pingable attribute allows\
    \ a network operator to advertise an IP\n   address of a node that should be reachable\
    \ from outside networks.\n   This node can be used as a destination address for\
    \ diagnostic tests.\n   The address specified MUST fall within the IP address\
    \ range\n   advertised in the route/route6 object containing the pingable\n  \
    \ attribute.  The ping-hdl provides a link to contact information for\n   an entity\
    \ capable of responding to queries concerning the specified\n   IP address.  An\
    \ example of using the pingable attribute is shown in\n   Figure 2.\n   route6:\
    \ 2001:DB8::/32\n   origin: AS64500\n   pingable: 2001:DB8::DEAD:BEEF\n   ping-hdl:\
    \ OPS4-RIPE\n                   Figure 2: Pingable Attribute Example\n"
- title: 3.  Using the RPSL Pingable Attribute
  contents:
  - "3.  Using the RPSL Pingable Attribute\n   The presence of one or more pingable\
    \ attributes signals to network\n   operators that the operator of the target\
    \ network is providing the\n   address(es) for external diagnostic testing.  Tests\
    \ involving the\n   advertised address(es) SHOULD be rate limited to no more than\
    \ ten\n   probes in a five-minute window unless prior arrangements are made\n\
    \   with the maintainer of the attribute.\n"
- title: 4.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "4.  Security Considerations\n   The use of routing registries based on RPSL requires\
    \ a significant\n   level of security.  In-depth discussion of the authentication\
    \ and\n   authorization capabilities and weaknesses within RPSL is in\n   [RFC2725].\
    \  The application of authentication in RPSL is key\n   considering the vulnerabilities\
    \ that may arise from the abuse of the\n   pingable attribute by nefarious actors.\
    \  Additional RPSL security\n   issues are discussed in the Security Considerations\
    \ sections of\n   [RFC2622] and [RFC4012].\n   The publication of this attribute\
    \ only explicitly signals the\n   availability of an ICMP Echo Request/Echo Response\
    \ service on the\n   specified IP address.  The operator, at his/her discretion,\
    \ MAY\n   deploy other services at the same IP address.  These services may be\n\
    \   impacted by the ping service, given its publicity via the RPSL.\n   While\
    \ this document specifies that external users of the pingable\n   attribute rate\
    \ limit their probes, there is no guarantee that they\n   will do so.  Operators\
    \ publicizing a pingable attribute are\n   encouraged to deploy their own rate\
    \ limiting for the advertised IP\n   address in order to reduce the risk of a\
    \ denial-of-service attack.\n   Services, protocols, and ports on the advertised\
    \ IP address should be\n   filtered if they are not intended for external users.\n"

    \ attribute to the route/route6 object and the inclusion of a point of\n   contact.\
