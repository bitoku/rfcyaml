  - "                          NETWORK HOST STATUS\n     This RFC reports on the status\
    \ of most Network Hosts from July 17\nto July 28.\n     On Tuesday, July 18, the\
    \ new IMP software was released.\n     Several Hosts are currently excluded from\
    \ the daily testing as\nthey are presently intended to be users only. Included\
    \ here are the\nTerminal IMPs, which are presently in the Network (AMES, MITRE,\
    \ RADC,\nNBS, ETAC, USC, GWC, NOAA, SAAC, ARPA, and BBN*).  This category also\n\
    includes the Network Control Center computer (Network address 5) which\nis used\
    \ solely for gathering statistics from the Network. Finally,\nincluded among these\
    \ Hosts are the following:\n       Network\n       Address               Site\
    \               Computer\n           7                 Rand               IBM-360/65\n\

    \ BBN Terminal IMP (Network Address 158) is a prototype and\nas such is frequently\
    \ not connected to the Network, but being\nused to refine and debug the Terminal\
    \ IMP programs.\nADDRESS  SITE           COMPUTER      STATUS OR PREDICTION  \
