- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   This document defines the formal Uniform Resource Name (URN)\n\
    \   Namespace Identifier (NID) for EIDR Identifiers.\n   EIDR Identifiers are\
    \ centrally registered, globally unique\n   identifiers for audiovisual works\
    \ and their variants, primarily film\n   and television.  A unique set of metadata\
    \ parameters describing the\n   associated work is bound to the EIDR Identifier\
    \ at the time of\n   registration.\n   EIDR Identifiers are a special kind of\
    \ DOI Names allocated by EIDR\n   Association specifically for audiovisual works.\
    \  The Digital Object\n   Identifier (DOI) system provides an infrastructure for\
    \ persistent\n   unique identification of objects of any type and is specified\
    \ in\n   [ISO26234].  A DOI name is the identifier that is permanently\n   assigned\
    \ to an object.  The use of DOI Names ensures persistence,\n   global uniqueness,\
    \ and an open resolution infrastructure.\n   As a DOI Name, an EIDR Identifier\
    \ has two components: a prefix\n   assigned exclusively to EIDR Association by\
    \ the DOI Registration\n   Authority and a suffix defined by EIDR Association.\
    \  Currently, EIDR\n   Identifiers use the prefix \"10.5240\", but additional\
    \ prefixes might\n   be introduced in the future.\n   The following is an example\
    \ of an EIDR Identifier in its canonical\n   representation:\n           10.5240/7791-8534-2C23-9030-8610-5\n\
    \   where \"10.5240\" is the prefix and \"7791-8534-2C23-9030-8610-5\" is the\n\
    \   suffix.  The canonical URN representation of the same EIDR Identifier\n  \
    \ is:\n           urn:eidr:10.5240:7791-8534-2C23-9030-8610-5\n   Note that \"\
    :\" is used as separator between prefix and suffix since\n   \"/\" is a URN reserved\
    \ character.\n   [EIDR-OVERVIEW] and [EIDR-INTRO] provide additional background\n\
    \   information.\n"
- title: 2.  Completed URN Namespace Definition Template
  contents:
  - "2.  Completed URN Namespace Definition Template\n   The namespace definition\
    \ according to the template in [RFC3406] is as\n   follows:\n   Namespace ID:\n\
    \      eidr\n   Registration Information:\n      Version 1\n      2014-03-03\n\
    \   Declared registrant of the namespace:\n      Name:\n         Entertainment\
    \ Identifier Registry Association\n      Address:\n         c/o Alliances Management\n\
    \         544 Hillside Road\n         Redwood City, CA 94062\n         USA\n \
    \     Contact:\n         URL: http://eidr.org/contact/\n         Email: info@eidr.org\n\
    \   Declaration of syntactic structure:\n      An EIDR Identifier is a special\
    \ kind of DOI Name (see [ISO26234])\n      and, as such, consists of two components:\
    \ a prefix denoted EIDR-\n      PREFIX and a suffix denoted EIDR-SUFFIX.  The\
    \ URN representation\n      URN-EIDR of an EIDR Identifier conforms to the syntax\
    \ (expressed\n      using [RFC5234]):\n           URN-EIDR = \"urn:eidr:\" EIDR-NSS\n\
    \           EIDR-NSS = EIDR-PREFIX \":\" EIDR-SUFFIX\n           EIDR-PREFIX =\
    \ 1*EIDR-CHARS\n           EIDR-SUFFIX = 1*EIDR-CHARS\n           EIDR-CHARS =\
    \ ALPHA / DIGIT / \"-\" / \".\" / \"_\"\n      The only value of EIDR-PREFIX currently\
    \ in use is \"10.5240\".\n      Additional prefix values conforming to the EIDR-PREFIX\
    \ syntax\n      might be introduced by EIDR Association in the future.  In all\n\
    \      cases, each of these additional prefix values will be associated\n    \
    \  with suffix values that conform to a subset of the EIDR-SUFFIX\n      syntax.\
    \  These additional prefixes and their corresponding\n      suffixes will be documented\
    \ in future revisions to this\n      registration.\n      An implementation can\
    \ process an EIDR-NSS with an unknown prefix\n      as an opaque string per the\
    \ \"Rules of Lexical Equivalence\" below,\n      and resolve it as a generic DOI\
    \ Name per the \"Process for\n      identifier resolution\" below.\n      When\
    \ EIDR-PREFIX is equal to \"10.5240\", the syntax of EIDR-SUFFIX\n      is further\
    \ constrained according to the to RP2079-SUFFIX syntax\n      specified in [SMPTERP2079]:\n\
    \           RP2079-SUFFIX = 5(4HEXDIG \"-\") CHECK\n           CHECK         =\
    \ DIGIT / ALPHA\n      where CHECK is the Mod 37,36 check character as specified\
    \ in\n      [ISO7064], computed over the 20 hexadecimal digits HEXDIG of\n   \
    \   RP2079-SUFFIX.\n      EXAMPLE: urn:eidr:10.5240:7791-8534-2C23-9030-8610-5\n\
    \   Relevant ancillary documentation:\n      [ISO26234] specifies DOI Name syntax\
    \ and registration.\n      [SMPTERP2079] specifies the syntax of the EIDR Identifier\
    \ with the\n      prefix \"10.5240\".\n   Identifier uniqueness considerations:\n\
    \      An EIDR Identifier is a DOI Name.  The ISO 26324 Registration\n      Authority\
    \ ensures that DOI Name uniqueness; therefore, the\n      URN-EIDR derived from\
    \ an EIDR Identifier is guaranteed to be\n      unique and never reassigned.\n\
    \      Furthermore, an EIDR Identifier is associated with a single\n      URN-EIDR.\n\
    \   Identifier persistence considerations:\n      An EIDR Identifier is a DOI\
    \ Name.  The ISO 26324 Registration\n      Authority ensures that a DOI Name remains\
    \ valid indefinitely;\n      therefore, the URN-EIDR derived from an EIDR Identifier\
    \ remains\n      valid indefinitely.\n   Process of identifier assignment:\n \
    \     EIDR Association registers each EIDR Identifier with the ISO 26324\n   \
    \   Registration Authority.\n      Entities involved in the motion picture and\
    \ television industry,\n      either directly in the production of content or\
    \ in its\n      distribution and related services, are eligible to apply for\n\
    \      registrant status.  Registrants pay an annual membership fee that\n   \
    \   depends on the size of the company.\n   Process for identifier resolution:\n\
    \      As a DOI Name, the resolution of the EIDR Identifier associated\n     \
    \ with an EIDR-NSS is handled by the ISO 26324 Registration\n      Authority.\n\
    \      The ISO 26324 Registration Authority operates a web service that\n    \
    \  allows the EIDR Identifier associated with an EIDR-NSS to be\n      resolved\
    \ by issuing an HTTP GET request to the following URI (see\n      [RFC7231]):\n\
    \               \"http://doi.org/\" EIDR-PREFIX \"/\" EIDR-SUFFIX\n      If the\
    \ EIDR Identifier exists, then an XML Schema instance\n      document (see [XMLSchema])\
    \ containing metadata associated with the\n      EIDR Identifier is returned;\
    \ otherwise, the HTTP status code \"404\n      Not Found\" is returned.\n    \
    \  EXAMPLE: http://doi.org/10.5240/7791-8534-2C23-9030-8610-5\n      NOTE: At\
    \ the time of this writing, this service of the ISO 26324\n      Registration\
    \ Authority is not available over TLS, and hence the\n      confidentiality of\
    \ queries is not protected.\n      EIDR Association operates additional services\
    \ specifically\n      tailored to EIDR users (see [EIDR-SERVICES]).  These services\n\
    \      include additional features, e.g., confidential lookup using TLS\n    \
    \  and the ability to register EIDR Identifiers.\n   Rules for Lexical Equivalence:\n\
    \      Lexical equivalence of EIDR-URN is defined by case-insensitive\n      string\
    \ match.\n   Conformance with URN Syntax:\n      As specified above, the syntax\
    \ of EIDR-URN is a subset of the URN\n      syntax specified in [RFC2141].\n \
    \  Validation mechanism:\n      The validity of an EIDR-NSS can only be guaranteed\
    \ by completing\n      the resolution process.\n      For EIDR-NSS with an EIDR-PREFIX\
    \ equal to \"10.5240\", the CHECK\n      value can be used for integrity checking,\
    \ as specified above.\n   Scope:\n      EIDR Identifiers are centrally registered,\
    \ globally unique\n      identifiers for use with audiovisual works worldwide.\n"
- title: 3.  Namespace Considerations
  contents:
  - "3.  Namespace Considerations\n   EIDR Identifiers are intended for use in Internet\
    \ applications, where\n   URNs are routinely used to identify audiovisual resources.\
    \  There is\n   no direct mapping from EIDR Identifiers to existing URN namespaces.\n"
- title: 4.  Community Considerations
  contents:
  - "4.  Community Considerations\n   The primary registrants of EIDR Identifiers\
    \ are producers and\n   distributors of audiovisual works, metadata aggregators,\
    \ and\n   audiovisual archives.  Any bona fide member of the ecosystem can\n \
    \  become an EIDR member and register any work.  EIDR Identifiers can be\n   used\
    \ by anyone to unambiguously identify an audiovisual asset and\n   retrieve underlying\
    \ metadata.  The primary benefits of their use are\n   associated with works in\
    \ wide distribution, management of long or\n   complex distribution chains, and\
    \ aggregation of information from\n   multiple sources.\n"
- title: 5.  IANA Considerations
  contents:
  - "5.  IANA Considerations\n   IANA has registered the Formal URN Namespace 'eidr'\
    \ in the \"Uniform\n   Resource Names (URN) Namespaces\" registry, using the registration\n\
    \   template in Section 2 of this document.\n"
- title: 6.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "6.  Security Considerations\n   This document specifies the syntax of the EIDR-URN\
    \ namespace and\n   makes no security representations.  Furthermore, the details\
    \ of\n   assignment and resolution processes are defined external to this\n  \
    \ document by EIDR Association and the ISO 26324 Registration\n   Authority, and\
    \ thus are outside the scope of this document.  Note,\n   however, that failure\
    \ to conform to the syntactic and lexical\n   equivalence rules in this specification\
    \ when using an EIDR Identifier\n   as a criteria for accessing restricted resources\
    \ can result in\n   granting unauthorized access to these resources.\n"
