  - "1.0 Introduction\n   We consider the problem of providing IP Integrated Services\
    \ [2] with\n   an ATM subnetwork.  This document is intended to be consistent\
    \ with\n   the rsvp protocol [3] for IP-level resource reservation, although it\n\
    \   applies also in the general case where GS and CLS services are\n   supported\
    \ through other mechanisms.  In the ATM network, we consider\n   ATM Forum UNI\
    \ Signaling, versions 3.0, 3.1 and 4.0 [4, 5, 6].  The\n   latter uses the more\
    \ complete service model of the ATM Forum's TM 4.0\n   specification [7, 8].\n\
    \   This is a complex problem with many facets.  In this document, we\n   focus\
    \ on the service types, parameters and signalling elements needed\n   for service\
    \ interoperation.  The resulting service mappings can be\n   used to provide effective\
    \ end-to-end Quality of Service (QoS) for IP\n   traffic that traverses ATM networks.\n\
    \   The IP services considered are Guaranteed Service (GS) [9] and\n   Controlled\
    \ Load Service (CLS) [10].  We also discuss the default Best\n   Effort Service\
    \ (BE) in parallel with these.  Our recommendations for\n   BE are intended to\
    \ be consistent with RFC 1755 [11], and [12], which\n   define how ATM VCs can\
    \ be used in support of normal BE IP service.\n   The ATM services we consider\
    \ are:\n        CBR           Constant Bit Rate\n        rtVBR         Real-time\
    \ Variable Bit Rate\n        nrtVBR        Non-real-time Variable Bit Rate\n \
    \       UBR           Unspecified Bit Rate\n        ABR           Available Bit\
    \ Rate\n   In the case of UNI 3.x signalling, where these service are not all\n\
    \   clearly distinguishable, we identify the appropriate available\n   services.\n\
    \   We recommend the following service mappings, since they follow most\n   naturally\
    \ from the service definitions:\n        Guaranteed Service    ->     CBR or rtVBR\n\
    \        Controlled Load       ->     nrtVBR or ABR (with a minimum\n        \
    \                             cell rate)\n        Best Effort           ->   \
    \  UBR or ABR\n   For completeness, however, we provide detailed mappings for\
    \ all\n   service combinations in Sections 5, 6, 7 and identify how each meets\n\
    \   or fails to meet the requirements of the higher level IP services.\n   The\
    \ reason for not restricting mappings to the most obvious or\n   natural ones\
    \ is that we cannot predict how widely available all of\n   these services will\
    \ be as ATM deployment evolves.  A number of\n   differences in service definitions,\
    \ such as the treatment of packets\n   in excess of the flow traffic descriptor,\
    \ make service mapping a\n   relatively complicated subject.\n   The remainder\
    \ of this introduction provides a general discussion of\n   the system configuration\
    \ and other assumptions.  Section 2 considers\n   the relevant ATM protocol elements\
    \ and the corresponding features of\n   Guaranteed, Controlled Load and Best Effort\
    \ services (the latter\n   being the default \"service\").  Section 3 discusses\
    \ a number of\n   remaining features of the IP services and how they can be handled\
    \ on\n   an ATM subnetwork.  Section 4 addresses the conversion of traffic\n \
    \  descriptors to account for ATM-layer overheads.  Section 5 gives the\n   detailed\
    \ VC setup parameters for Guaranteed Service, and considers\n   the effect of\
    \ using each of the ATM service categories.  Section 6\n   provides a similar\
    \ treatment for Controlled Load Service.  Section 7\n   considers Best Effort\
    \ service.\n   This document is only a part of the total solution to providing\
    \ the\n   interworking of IP integrated services with ATM subnetworks.  The\n\
    \   important issue of VC management, including flow aggregation, is\n   considered\
    \ in [13, 14, 15].  We do not consider how routing, QoS\n   sensitive or not,\
    \ interacts with the use of ATM VCs.  We expect that\n   a considerable degree\
    \ of implementation latitude will exist, even\n   within the guidelines presented\
    \ here.  Many aspects of interworking\n   between IP and ATM will depend on economic\
    \ factors, and will not be\n   subject to standardization.\n"
- title: 1.1 General System Architecture
  contents:
  - "1.1 General System Architecture\n   We assume that the reader has a general working\
    \ knowledge of IP, rsvp\n   and ATM protocols.  The network architecture we consider\
    \ is\n   illustrated in Figure 1.  An IP-attached host may send unicast\n   datagrams\
    \ to another host, or may use an IP multicast address to send\n   packets to all\
    \ of the hosts which have \"joined\" the multicast \"tree\".\n   In either case,\
    \ a destination host may then use RSVP to establish\n   resource reservation in\
    \ routers along the internet path for the data\n   flow.\n   An ATM network lies\
    \ in the path (chosen by the IP routing), and\n   consists of one or more ATM\
    \ switches.  It uses SVCs to provide both\n   resources and QoS within the ATM\
    \ cloud.  These connections are set\n   up, added to (in the case of multipoint\
    \ trees), torn down, and\n   controlled by the edge devices, which act as both\
    \ IP routers and ATM\n   interfaces, capable of initiating and managing VCs across\
    \ the ATM\n   user-to-network (UNI) interface.  The edge devices are assumed to\
    \ be\n   fully functional in both the IP int-serv/RSVP protocols and the ATM\n\
    \   UNI protocols, as well as translating between them.\n                    \

    \                       Switches (X).\n   When considering the edge devices with\
    \ respect to traffic flowing\n   from source to destination, the upstream edge\
    \ device is called the\n   \"ingress\" point and the downstream device the \"\
    egress\" point.  The\n   edge devices may be considered part of the IP internet\
    \ or part of the\n   ATM cloud, or both.  They process RSVP messages, reserve\
    \ resources,\n   and maintain soft state (in the control path), and classify and\n\
    \   schedule packets (in the data path).  They also initiate ATM\n   connections\
    \ by signalling, and accept or refuse connections signalled\n   to them.  They\
    \ police and schedule cells going into the ATM cloud.\n   The service mapping\
    \ function occurs when an IP-level reservation\n   (RESV message) triggers the\
    \ edge device to translate the RSVP service\n   requirements into ATM VC (UNI)\
    \ semantics.\n   A range of VC management policies are possible, which determine\n\
    \   whether a flow initiates a new VC or joins an existing one.  VCs are\n   managed\
    \ according to a combination of standards and local policy\n   rules, which are\
    \ specific to either the implementation (equipment) or\n   the operator (network\
    \ service provider).  Point-to-multipoint\n   connections within the ATM cloud\
    \ can be used to support general IP\n   multicast flows.  In ATM, a point to multipoint\
    \ connection can be\n   controlled by the source (or root) node, or a leaf initiated\
    \ join\n   (LIJ) feature in ATM may be used.  The topic of VC management is\n\
    \   considered at length in other ISSLL documents [13, 14, 15].\n   Figure 2 shows\
    \ the functions of an edge device, summarizing the work\n   not part of IP or\

    \           Figure 2: Edge Device Functions showing the IWF\n   In the logical\
    \ view of Figure 2, some functions, such as scheduling,\n   are shown separately,\
    \ since these functions are present on both the\n   IP and ATM sides.  However\
    \ it may be possible in an integrated\n   implementation to combine such functions.\n\
    \   The service mapping and VC management functions can be highly\n   interdependent.\
    \  For example: (i) Multiple integrated-services flows\n   may be aggregated to\
    \ use one point-to-multipoint VC.  In this case,\n   we assume the IP flows are\
    \ of the same service type and their\n   parameters have been merged appropriately.\
    \  (ii) The VC management\n   function may choose to allocate extra resources\
    \ in anticipation of\n   further reservations or based on an empiric of changing\
    \ TSpecs.\n   (iii) There MUST exist a path for best effort flows and for sending\n\
    \   the rsvp control messages.  How this interacts with the establishment\n  \
    \ of VCs for QoS traffic may alter the desired characteristics of those\n   VCs.\
    \  See [13, 14, 15] for further details on VC management.\n   Therefore, in discussing\
    \ the service mapping problem, we will assume\n   that the VC management function\
    \ of the IWF can always express its\n   result in terms of an IP-level service\
    \ with some QoS and TSpec.  The\n   service mapping algorithm can then identify\
    \ the appropriate VC\n   parameters as if a new VC were to be created for this\
    \ service.  The\n   VC management function can then use this information consistent\
    \ with\n   its own policy, which determines whether the resulting action uses\n\
    \   new or existing VCs.\n"

  - "1.2 Related Documents\n   Earlier ATM Forum documents combined signalling, traffic\
    \ management\n   and other areas into a single document, e.g., UNI 3.0 [4] and\
    \ UNI 3.1\n   [5].  The 3.1 release was used to correct errors and fix alignment\n\
    \   with the ITU.  While UNI 3.0 and 3.1 are incompatible in terms of\n   actual\
    \ codepoints, the semantics are generally the same.  Therefore,\n   we will often\
    \ refer to UNI 3.x to mean either version of the ATM\n   protocol.\n   After 3.1,\
    \ the ATM Forum released documents separately for each\n   technical working group.\
    \  The UNI Signalling 4.0 [6] and Traffic\n   Management 4.0 [7] documents represent\
    \ a consistent overall ATM\n   protocol, and we will sometime refer to the combination\
    \ as TM/UNI\n   4.0.\n   Within the IETF, related material includes the work of\
    \ the rsvp [3],\n   int-serv [2, 9, 10, 16, 17] and ion working groups [11, 12].\
    \  Rsvp\n   defines the resource reservation protocol (which is analogous to\n\
    \   signalling in ATM). Int-serv defines the behavior and semantics of\n   particular\
    \ services (analogous to the Traffic Management working\n   group in the ATM Forum).\
    \  Ion defines interworking of IP and ATM for\n   traditional Best Effort service,\
    \ and generally covers issues related\n   to IP/ATM routing and addressing.\n\
    \   A large number of ATM signalling details are covered in RFC 1755\n   [10];\
    \ e.g., differences between UNI 3.0 and UNI 3.1, encapsulation,\n   frame-relay\
    \ interworking, etc.  These considerations extend to IP\n   over ATM with QoS\
    \ as well.  The description given in this document of\n   IP Best Effort service\
    \ (i.e. the default behavior) over ATM is\n   intended to be consistent with RFC\
    \ 1755 and it's extension for UNI\n   4.0 [11], and those documents are to be\
    \ considered definitive.  For\n   non-best-effort services, certain IP/ATM features\
    \ will diverge from\n   the following RFC 1755.  We have attempted to note such\
    \ differences\n   explicitly.  (For example, best effort VCs may be taken down\
    \ on\n   timeout by either edge device, while QoS VCs are only removed by the\n\
    \   upstream edge device when the corresponding rsvp reservation is\n   deleted.)\n\
    \   Another related document is RFC 1821 [17], which represents an early\n   discussion\
    \ of issues involved with interoperating IP and ATM\n   protocols for integrated\
    \ services and QoS.\n"

- title: 2.1 Service Category and Bearer Capability
  contents:
  - "2.1 Service Category and Bearer Capability\n   The highest level of abstraction\
    \ distinguishing features of ATM VCs\n   is in the service category or bearer\
    \ capability.  Service categories\n   were introduced in TM/UNI 4.0; previously\
    \ the bearer capability was\n   used to discriminate at this level.\n   These\
    \ elements indicate the general properties of a VC: whether there\n   is a real-time\
    \ delay constraint, whether the traffic is constant or\n   variable rate, the\
    \ applicable traffic and QoS description parameters\n   and (implicitly) the complexity\
    \ of some supporting switch mechanisms\n   (e.g., ABR).\n   For UNI 3.0 and UNI\
    \ 3.1, there are only two distinct options for\n   bearer capabilities (in our\
    \ context):\n        BCOB-A:  constant rate, timing required, unicast/multipoint;\n\
    \        BCOB-C:  variable rate, timing not required, unicast/multipoint.\n  \
    \ A third capability, BCOB-X, can be used as a substitute for the above\n   two\
    \ capabilities, with its dependent parameters (traffic type and\n   timing requirement)\
    \ set appropriately.  The distinction between the\n   BCOB-X formulation and the\
    \ \"equivalent\" (for our purposes) BCOB-A and\n   BCOB-C constructs is whether\
    \ the ATM network is to provide pure cell\n   relay service or interwork with\
    \ other technologies (with\n   interoperable signalling), such as narrowband ISDN.\
    \  Where this\n   distinction is applicable, the appropriate code SHOULD be used\
    \ (see\n   [5] and related ITU specs, e.g., I.371).\n   In TM/UNI 4.0 the service\
    \ categories are:\n        Constant Bit Rate (CBR)\n        Real-time Variable\

- title: 2.2 Cell Loss Priority Bit, Tagging and Conformance Definitions
  contents:
  - "2.2 Cell Loss Priority Bit, Tagging and Conformance Definitions\n   Each ATM\
    \ cell header carries a Cell Loss Priority (CLP) bit.  Cells\n   with CLP=1 are\
    \ said to be \"tagged\" or \"marked\" and have lower\n   priority.  This tagging\
    \ may be done by the source, to indicate\n   relative priority within the VC,\
    \ or by a switch, to indicate traffic\n   in violation of policing parameters.\
    \  Options involving the use of\n   tagging are decided at call setup time.\n\
    \   A Conformance Definition is a rule that determines whether a cell is\n   conforming\
    \ to the traffic descriptor of the VC.  The conformance\n   definition is given\
    \ in terms of a Generic Cell Rate Algorithm (GCRA),\n   also known as a \"leaky\
    \ bucket\" algorithm, for CBR and VBR services.\n   The conformance definition\
    \ also specifies rules for tagging traffic\n   in excess of the {SCR, MBS} GCRA\
    \ traffic descriptor.  (Note, the term\n   \"compliance\" in ATM is used to describe\
    \ the behavior of a connection,\n   as opposed to \"conformance\", which applies\
    \ to a single cell.)\n   The network may tag cells that are non-conforming, rather\
    \ than\n   dropping them if the VC set-up requests tagging and the network\n \
    \  supports the tagging option.  When tagging is used and congestion\n   occurs,\
    \ a switch MUST attempt to discard tagged cells in preference\n   to discarding\
    \ CLP=0 cells.  However, the mechanism for doing this is\n   completely implementation\
    \ specific.  The behavior that best meets the\n   requirements of IP Integrated\
    \ Services is where tagged cells are\n   treated as \"best effort\" in the sense\
    \ that they are transported when\n   bandwidth is available, queued when buffers\
    \ are available, and\n   dropped when resources are overcommitted.  ATM standards,\
    \ however, do\n   not explicitly specify treatment of tagged traffic.  Providers\
    \ of GS\n   and CLS service with ATM subnetworks SHOULD ascertain the actual\n\
    \   behavior of ATM implementation with respect to tagged cells.\n   Since GS\
    \ and CLS services REQUIRE excess traffic to be treated as\n   best effort, the\
    \ tagging option SHOULD always be chosen (if\n   supported) in the VC setup as\
    \ a means of \"downgrading\" the cells\n   comprising non-conformant packets.\
    \  The term \"best effort\" can be\n   interpreted in two ways.  The first is\
    \ as a service class that, for\n   example, may be implemented as a separate queue.\
    \  The other sense is\n   more generic, meaning that the network makes a best\
    \ effort to\n   transport the traffic.  A reasonable interpretation of this is\
    \ that a\n   network with no contending traffic would transport the packet, while\n\
    \   a very congested network would drop the packet.  A mechanism that\n   tags\
    \ best effort packets with lower loss priority (such as with the\n   ATM CLP bit)\
    \ would drop some of these packets, but would not reorder\n   the remaining ones\
    \ with respect to the conforming portion of the\n   flow.  The \"best effort\"\
    \ mechanism for excess traffic does not\n   necessarily have to be the same as\
    \ that for best effort \"service\", as\n   long as it fits this generic sense\
    \ of best effort.\n   There are three conformance definitions of VBR service (for\
    \ both\n   rtVBR and nrtVBR) to consider.  In VBR, only the conformance\n   definition\
    \ VBR.3 supports tagging and applies the GCRA with rate PCR\n   to the aggregate\
    \ CLP=0+1 cells, and another GCRA with rate SCR to the\n   CLP=0 cells.  This\
    \ conformance definition SHOULD always be used with\n   a VBR service supporting\
    \ IP integrated services.  For UBR service,\n   conformance definition UBR.2 supports\
    \ the use of tagging, but a CLP=1\n   cell does not imply non-conformance; rather,\
    \ it may be used by the\n   network to indicate congestion.\n   In TM/UNI 4.0\
    \ tagging is not a feature of the conformance definitions\n   for the CBR or ABR\
    \ service categories.  (Since conformance\n   definitions are generally network\
    \ specific, some implementations CBR\n   or ABR may, in fact, use tagging in some\
    \ way.)  Wherever an ATM\n   network does support tagging, in the sense of transporting\
    \ CLP=1\n   cells on a \"best effort\" basis, it is a useful and preferable\n\
    \   mechanism for handling excess traffic.\n   It is always better for the IWF\
    \ to tag cells when it can anticipate\n   that the ATM network would do so.  This\
    \ is because the IWF knows the\n   IP packet boundaries and can tag all of the\
    \ cells corresponding to a\n   packet.  If left to the ATM layer UPC, the network\
    \ would inevitably\n   drop some of the cells of a packet while carrying others,\
    \ which would\n   then be dropped by the receiver.  Therefore, the IWF, knowing\
    \ the VC\n   GCRA parameters, SHOULD always anticipate the cells which will be\n\
    \   tagged by the ATM UPC and tag all of the cells uniformly across each\n   affected\
    \ packet.  See Section 3.2 for further discussion of excess\n   traffic.\n"

  contents:
  - "2.5 Traffic Descriptors\n   The ATM traffic descriptor always contains a peak\
    \ cell rate (PCR)\n   (for each direction).  For VBR services it also contains\
    \ a\n   sustainable cell rate (SCR) and maximum burst size (MBS).  The SCR\n \
    \  and MBS form a leaky bucket pair (rate, depth), while the bucket\n   depth\
    \ parameter for PCR is CDVT.  Note that CDVT is not signalled\n   explicitly,\
    \ but is determined by the network operator, and can be\n   viewed as a measure\
    \ of the jitter imposed by the network.\n   Since CDVT is generally presumed to\
    \ be small (equivalent to a few\n   cells of token bucket depth), and cannot be\
    \ set independently for\n   each connection, it cannot be used to account for\
    \ the burstiness\n   permitted by b of the IP-layer TSpec.  Additional buffering\
    \ may be\n   needed at the IWF to account for the depth of the token bucket.\n\
    \   The ATM Burst Tolerance (BT) is equivalent to MBS (see TM 4.0 [6] for\n  \
    \ the exact equation).  They are both expressions of the bucket depth\n   parameter\
    \ associated with SCR.  The units of BT are time while the\n   units of MBS are\
    \ cells.  Since both SCR and MBS are signalled, they\n   can be computed directly\
    \ from the IP layer traffic description.  The\n   specific manner in which resources\
    \ are allocated from the traffic\n   description is implementation specific. \
    \ Note that when translating\n   the traffic parameters, the segmentation overhead\
    \ and minimum policed\n   unit need to be taken into account (see Section 4.1\
    \ below).\n   In ATM UNI Signalling 4.0 there are the notions of Alternative\n\
    \   Traffic Descriptors and Minimal Traffic Descriptors.  Alternative\n   Traffic\
    \ Descriptors enumerate other acceptable choices for traffic\n   descriptors and\
    \ are not considered here.  Minimal Traffic Descriptors\n   are used in \"negotiation,\"\
    \ which refers to the specific way in which\n   an ATM connection is set up. \
    \ To illustrate, roughly, taking PCR as\n   an example: A minimal PCR and a requested\
    \ PCR are signalled, the\n   requested PCR being the usual item signalled, and\
    \ the minimal PCR\n   being the absolute minimum that the source edge device will\
    \ accept.\n   When both minimal and requested parameters are present, the\n  \
    \ intermediate switches along the path may reduce the requested PCR to\n   a \"\
    comfortable\" level.  This choice is part of admission control, and\n   is therefore\
    \ implementation specific.  If at any point the requested\n   PCR falls below\
    \ the minimal PCR then the call is cleared.  Minimal\n   Traffic Descriptors can\
    \ be used to present an acceptable range for\n   parameters and ensure a higher\
    \ likelihood of call admission.  In\n   general, our discussion of connection\
    \ parameters assumes the values\n   resulting from successful connection setup.\n\
    \   The Best Effort indicator (used only with UBR) and Tagging indicators\n  \
    \ (see Section 2.2) are also part of the signalled information element\n   (IE)\
    \ containing the traffic descriptor.  In the UNI 4.0 traffic\n   descriptor IE\

  - "2.5.1 Translating Traffic Descriptors for Guaranteed Service\n   For Guaranteed\
    \ Service the source TSpec contains peak rate, rate and\n   and bucket depth parameters,\
    \ p_s, r_s, b_s.  The receiver TSpec\n   contains corresponding parameters p_r,\
    \ r_r, b_r.  The (receiver)\n   RSpec also has a rate, R.  The two different TSpec\
    \ rates are intended\n   to support receiver heterogeneity, in the sense that\
    \ receivers can\n   accept different rates representing different subsets of the\
    \ sender's\n   traffic.  Whenever rates from different receivers differ, the values\n\
    \   MUST always be merged appropriately before being mapping into ATM\n   parameters.\n\
    \   Note that when the sender and receiver TSpec rates r_s, r_r differ,\n   there\
    \ is no mechanism specified (in either rsvp or the int-serv\n   specs) for indicating\
    \ which subset of the traffic is to be\n   transported.  Implementation of this\
    \ feature is therefore completely\n   network specific.  The policing and scheduling\
    \ mechanisms may simply\n   be parameterized with the (lower) receiver rate, resulting\
    \ in the\n   random loss of traffic sufficient to make up the difference in rates.\n\
    \   The receiver TSpec rate describes the traffic for which resources are\n  \
    \ to be reserved, and may be used for policing, while the RSpec rate\n   (which\
    \ cannot be smaller) is used (perhaps in an implementation\n   specific way) to\
    \ modify the allocated service bandwidth in order to\n   reduce the delay.\n \
    \  When mapping Guaranteed Service onto a rtVBR VC, the ATM traffic\n   descriptor\
    \ parameters (PCR, SCR, MBS) can be set cannonically as:\n        PCR = p_r\n\
    \        SCR = R\n        MBS = b_r.\n   There are a number of conditions that\
    \ may lead to different choices.\n   The following discussion is not intended\
    \ to set hard requirements,\n   but to provide some interpretation and guidance\
    \ on the bounds of\n   possible parameter mappings.  The ingress edge device generally\n\
    \   includes a buffer preceding the ATM network interface.  This buffer\n   can\
    \ be used to absorb bursts that fall within the IP-level TSpec, but\n   not within\
    \ the ATM traffic descriptor.  The minimal REQUIREMENT for\n   guaranteed service\
    \ is that the delay in this buffer MUST NOT exceed\n   b/R, and the delays within\
    \ the ATM network MUST be accurately\n   accounted for in the values of Adspec\
    \ parameters C and D advertised\n   by the ingress router (see Section 3.3 below).\n\
    \   If either an edge device buffer of size b_r exists or the ATM maximum\n  \
    \ burst size (MBS) parameter is at least b_r, then the various rate\n   parameters\
    \ will generally exhibit the following relationship:\n        r_r <= SCR <= R\
    \ <= PCR <= APB <= line rate\n        r_r <=       p_r       <= APB\n   APB refers\
    \ to the General Characterization Parameter,\n   AVAILABLE_PATH_BANDWIDTH, which\
    \ is negotiated in the Adspec portion\n   of the PATH message.  APB reflects the\
    \ narrowest bottleneck rate\n   along the path, and so is always no larger than\
    \ the local line rate.\n   The receiver SHOULD choose a peak rate no greater than\
    \ APB for the\n   reservation to be accepted, although the source peak rate, p_s,\
    \ could\n   be higher, as the source does not know the value of APB.  There is\
    \ no\n   advantage to allocating any rate above APB of course, so it is an\n \
    \  upper bound for all the other parameters.\n   We might normally expect to find\
    \ R <= p_r, as would be necessary for\n   the simple mapping of PCR = p_r, SCR\
    \ = R given above.  However, a\n   receiver is free to choose R > p_r to lower\
    \ the GS delay [8].  In\n   this case, PCR cannot be set below R, because a burst\
    \ of size b\n   arriving into the buffer MUST be cleared at rate R to keep the\
    \ first\n   component of GS delay down to b/R.  So here we will have PCR = R.\
    \  It\n   may seem that PCR = p_r would be sufficient to avoid buffer overflow,\n\
    \   since data is generated at the source at a rate bounded by p_r.\n   However,\
    \ setting PCR < R, can result in the delay bound advertised by\n   C and D not\
    \ being met.  Also, traffic is always subject to jitter in\n   the network, and\
    \ the arrival rate at a network element can exceed p_r\n   for short periods of\
    \ time.\n   In the case R <= p_r, we may still choose PCR such that R <= PCR <\n\
    \   p_r.  The edge device buffer is then necessary (and sufficient) to\n   absorb\
    \ the bursts (limited to size b_r + C_sum + R D_sum) which\n   arrive faster than\
    \ they depart.  For example, it may be the case that\n   the cost of the ATM VC\
    \ depends on PCR, while the cost of the Internet\n   service reservation is not\
    \ strongly dependent on the IP-level peak\n   rate.  The user may then have an\
    \ incentive to set p_r to APB, while\n   the operator of the IP/ATM edge router\
    \ has an incentive to reduce PCR\n   as much as possible.  This may be a realistic\
    \ concern, since the\n   charging models of IP and ATM are historically different\
    \ as far as\n   usage sensitivity, and the value of p_r, if set close to APB,\
    \ could\n   be many times the nominal GS allocated rate of R.  Thus, we can set\n\
    \   PCR to R, with a buffer of size b_r + C_sum + R D_sum, with no loss\n   of\
    \ traffic, and no violation of the GS delay bound.\n   A more subtle, and perhaps\
    \ controversial case is where we set SCR to\n   a value below R.  The major feature\
    \ of the GS service is to allow a\n   receiver to specify the allocated rate R\
    \ to be larger than the rate\n   r_r sufficient to transport the traffic, in order\
    \ to lower the\n   queueing delay (roughly) from b/r + C_TOT/r + D_TOT to b/R\
    \ + C_TOT/R\n   + D_TOT.  To effectively allocate bandwidth R to the flow, we\
    \ set SCR\n   to match R.  (Note it is unnecessary in any case to set SCR above\
    \ R,\n   so the relation, SCR <= R, is still true.)  It is possible to set SCR\n\
    \   to a value as low as r_r, without violating the delay bounds or\n   overflowing\
    \ the edge device buffer.  With PCR = R, a burst of size b\n   will be buffered\
    \ and sent into the ATM network at rate R, so the last\n   byte suffers delay\
    \ only b/R.  Any further traffic will be limited to\n   rate r_r, which is SCR,\
    \ so with the arriving and departing rates\n   matched, its delay will also be\
    \ no more than b/R.\n   While this scenario meets the GS service requirements,\
    \ the penalty\n   for allocating SCR = r_r rather than R is that the delay in\
    \ the ATM\n   network will have a component of MBS/SCR, which will be b/r rather\n\
    \   than b/R, contained in the D term advertised for the ATM sub-network\n   (see\
    \ further discussion in Section 3.3 below).  It is also true that\n   allocating\
    \ r instead of R in a portion of the path is rather against\n   the spirit of\
    \ GS.  As mentioned above, this mapping may however be\n   useful in practice\
    \ in the case where pricing in the ATM network leads\n   to different incentives\
    \ in the tradeoff between delay and bandwidth\n   than those of the user who buys\
    \ IP integrated services.\n   Another point of view on parameter mapping suggests\
    \ that SCR may\n   merely reflect the traffic description, hence SCR = r_r, while\
    \ the\n   service requirement is expressed in the QoS parameter as CDV = b/R.\n\
    \   Thus the ATM network may internally allocate bandwidth R, but it is\n   free\
    \ to use other methods as well to achieve the delay constraint.\n   Mechanisms\
    \ such as statistical flow/connection aggregation may be\n   implemented in the\
    \ ATM network and hidden from the user (or parameter\n   mapping module in the\
    \ edge router) which sees only the interface\n   implemented in the signalled\
    \ parameters.\n   Note that this discussion considers an edge device buffer size\
    \ of\n   b_r.  In practice, it may be necessary for the AAL/segmentation\n   module\
    \ to buffer M bytes in converting packets to cells.  Also an\n   additional amount\
    \ of buffer equal to C_sum + R D_sum is generally\n   necessary to absorb jitter\
    \ imposed by the upstream network [8].\n   With ATM, it is possible to have little\
    \ or no buffer in the edge\n   router, because the ATM VC can be set to accept\
    \ bursts at peak rate.\n   This may be unusual, since the edge router normally\
    \ has enough buffer\n   to absorb bursts according to the TSpec token bucket parameters.\
    \  We\n   consider two cases.  First, if PCR >= p_r, then MBS can be set to b_r\n\
    \   and no buffering is necessary to absorb non-excessive bursts.  The\n   extra\
    \ buffering needed to absorb jitter can also be transferred to\n   MBS.  This\
    \ effectively moves the buffering across the UNI into the\n   ATM network.\n \
    \  For completeness, we consider an edge router with no burst-absorbing\n   buffers\
    \ and an MBS parameter of approximately zero.  In this case it\n   is sufficient\
    \ to set the rate parameters to PCR = SCR = max (R, p_r).\n   This amounts to\
    \ peak-rate allocation of bandwidth, which will not\n   usually be very cost effective.\
    \  This case may be relevant where the\n   IP routers and ATM switches differ\
    \ substantially in their buffering\n   designs.  IP-level users may typically\
    \ specify much larger burst\n   parameters than can be handled in the ATM subnet.\
    \  Peak-rate\n   bandwidth allocation provides a means to work around this problem.\n\
    \   It is also true that intermediate tradeoffs can be formulated, where\n   the\
    \ burst-absorbing buffer is less than b bytes, and SCR is set above\n   R and\
    \ below p_r.  Note that jitter-absorbing buffers (C_sum + R\n   D_sum) can not\
    \ be avoided, generally, by increasing ATM rates, unless\n   SCR is set to exceed\
    \ the physical line rate(s) into the edge device\n   for the flow.\n   For GS\
    \ over CBR, the value of PCR may be mapped to the RSpec rate R,\n   if the edge\
    \ device has a buffer of size b_r + C_sum + R D_sum.  With\n   little or no burst\
    \ buffering, the requirements resemble the zero-\n   buffer case above, and we\
    \ have PCR = max (R, p_r).  Additional\n   buffers sufficient to absorb network\
    \ jitter, given by C_sum, D_sum,\n   MUST always be provided in the edge router,\
    \ or in the ATM network via\n   MBS.\n"

- title: 2.6 QoS Classes and Parameters
  contents:
  - "2.6 QoS Classes and Parameters\n   In UNI 3.x the quality of service is indicated\
    \ by a single parameter\n   called \"QoS Class,\" which is essentially an index\
    \ to a network\n   specific table of values for the actual QoS parameters.  In\
    \ TM/UNI\n   4.0 three QoS parameters may be individually signalled, and the\n\
    \   signalled values override those implied by the QoS Class, which is\n   still\
    \ present.  These parameters are the Cell Loss Ratio (CLR), Cell\n   Transfer\
    \ Delay (CTD), and Cell Delay Variation (CDV) [6].\n   A network provider may\
    \ choose to associate other parameters, such as\n   Severely Errored Cell Block\
    \ Ratio, with a QoS Class definition, but\n   these cannot be signalled individually.\
    \  The ATM Forum UNI 3.0, 3.1\n   and TM 4.0 specs, following prior ITU specs,\
    \ give vague qualitative\n   definitions for QoS Classes 1 to 4.  (QoS Class 0\
    \ is well-defined as\n   \"no QoS parameters defined\".)  Since our mapping is\
    \ based on these\n   specifications, we generally follow this guidance by setting\
    \ the QoS\n   Class value to 0 for UBR and ABR (as REQUIRED), 1 for CBR and rtVBR\n\
    \   and 3 for nrtVBR.  Note that the QoS Class follows the ATM service\n   category,\
    \ and not the IP service, to avoid combination that are\n   unlikely to be supported.\
    \  For example, if only nrtVBR is available\n   for GS, then choosing QoS Class\
    \ = 1 would probably result in\n   connection failure.  The QoS Class MUST NOT\
    \ be interpreted as a way\n   to add real-time behavior to an inherently non-real-time\
    \ service.\n   The ITU has included a standard set of parameter values for a (small)\n\
    \   number of QoS Classes in the latest version of Recommendation I.356\n   [21].\
    \  Network providers may choose to define further network-\n   specific QoS Classes\
    \ in addition to these.  Note that the QoS class\n   definitions in the new I.356\
    \ version might not align with the model\n   we follow from the ATM Forum UNI\
    \ specs.  Apart from these\n   definitions, there is no consistent agreement on\
    \ QoS Class\n   definitions among providers in practice.\n   The ATM QoS parameters\
    \ have no explicitly signalled IP layer\n   counterparts.  The values that are\
    \ signalled in the ATM network are\n   determined by the IP service definitions\
    \ and knowledge of the\n   underlying ATM network characteristics, as explained\
    \ below.\n   The ingress edge router SHOULD keep a table of QoS information for\n\
    \   the set of egress routers that it may establish VCs with.  This table\n  \
    \ may be simplified by using default values, but it will probably be\n   good\
    \ practice to maintain a table of current data for the most\n   popular egress\
    \ points.  An edge device that initiates VC setup\n   generally needs to have\
    \ some way to propose initial value for CDV and\n   CTD, even if they are changed\
    \ by negotiation; so by positing such a\n   table, we are not creating any new\
    \ design burden.  Cached information\n   can be updated when VCs are successfully\
    \ established, and to the\n   extent that IP-layer reservations can wait for VCs\
    \ to complete, the\n   values can be refined through iterated negotiation.\n \
    \  Both GS and CLS REQUIRE that losses of packets due to congestion be\n   minimized,\
    \ so that the loss rate is approximately the same as for an\n   unloaded network.\
    \  The characteristic loss behavior of the physical\n   medium not due to congestion\
    \ (e.g., bit errors or fading on wireless\n   channels) determines the order of\
    \ the permitted packet loss rate.\n   The ingress edge device MUST choose a value\
    \ of CLR that provides the\n   appropriate IP-level packet loss rate.  The CLR\
    \ value may be uniform\n   over all egress points in the ATM network, or may differ,\
    \ e.g., when\n   wireless or satellite ATM links are in some paths.  The determination\n\
    \   of CLR MUST account for the effects of packet size distribution and\n   ATM\
    \ Frame Discard mode (which can change the effective packet loss\n   rate by orders\
    \ of magnitude [22]).\n   The ingress router will also tabulate values for the\
    \ Minimum Path\n   Latency (MPL) and estimated queueing delays (D_ATM) for each\
    \ egress\n   point.  The latter will be used as part of the Adspec \"D\" parameter\n\
    \   for GS, but its use here applies to CLS as well (when the VC setup\n   includes\
    \ delay parameters).  MPL represents all constant (non-\n   congestion related)\
    \ delays, including propagation delay.  D_ATM\n   accounts for the variable component\
    \ of delays in the ATM network.\n   (It may depend on non-signalled parameters\
    \ such as CDVT.)  Given\n   these quantities, a new VC can be set up with delay-related\
    \ QoS\n   parameters given by\n        CDV = D_ATM\n        CTD = D_ATM + MPL.\n\
    \   (CDV and CTD may be adjusted (increased) by the slack term in GS, see\n  \
    \ Section 3.3 below.)\n   It is interesting (and perhaps unfortunate) to note\
    \ that in a typical\n   GS/rtVBR service, the delay bound advertised can contain\
    \ two\n   components of b/R instead of one.  Consider the simple case where SCR\n\
    \   = R is the rate allocated to the flow in both IP routers and ATM\n   switches\
    \ along the path, and the buffer allocation is MBS = b.\n   Parekh's theory [23],\
    \ which is the basis of the GS delay formula [8]\n   states that the b/R delay\
    \ term occurs only once, because once a burst\n   of size b has been served by\
    \ a congested node at rate R, the packets\n   will not arrive at a subsequent\
    \ node as a single burst.  However, we\n   can't tell a priori if this bottleneck\
    \ will occur in the ATM network\n   or elsewhere in the IP network, so the declaration\
    \ of CDV SHOULD\n   account for it (i.e., CDV >= b/R).  Once CDV is set, the ATM\
    \ network\n   can impose this delay, whether or not the traffic arrives in a burst.\n\
    \   Since the delay b/R can also occur elsewhere, it cannot be removed\n   from\
    \ the first term of the GS delay formula.  The ATM b/R delay\n   component appears\
    \ in the third term of the GS delay formula, D_tot.\n   See Section 3.3 below\
    \ for more on GS Adspec parameters.  This effect\n   may be mitigated when the\
    \ ATM network employs more efficient\n   statistical resource allocation schemes.\n"

  contents:
  - "3.1 Path Characterization Parameters for IP Integrated Services with ATM\n  \
    \ This section discusses the setting of General Characterization\n   Parameters\
    \ (GCPs) at an ATM egress edge router.  GCPs are signalled\n   from IP source\
    \ to IP destination, and modified by intermediate nodes\n   using the Adspec portion\
    \ of PATH messages in rsvp.  The GS-specific\n   Adspec parameters are discussed\
    \ below in Section 3.3.  These\n   parameters are denoted as <x,y> where x is\
    \ the service and y is the\n   parameter number.  Service number 1 indicates default\
    \ or general\n   parameter values.  Please refer to [25] for definitions and details.\n\
    \   The IS break bit <1,2> MUST, of course, be left alone by\n   implementations\
    \ following these guidelines (as they are presumably\n   IS-aware).  Similarly,\
    \ the router MUST always increment IS_HOPS\n   <1,4>.  The GS and CLS service-specific\
    \ break bits, <2,2> and <5,2>\n   respectively, MUST be set if the support of\
    \ the service is\n   inadequate.  In general GS is adequately supported by CBR\
    \ (BCOB-A)\n   and rtVBR service categories, and not adequately supported by UBR,\n\
    \   ABR and nrtVBR because delays are not controlled.  CLS may be\n   adequately\
    \ supported by all service categories except UBR (or Best\n   Effort in UNI 3.x).\
    \  See Sections 5, 6 for further discussion.\n   For GS, the ATM network MUST\
    \ meet the delay performance advertised\n   through the Adspec parameters, MPL,\
    \ C, and D.  If it cannot\n   predictably meet these requirements, the GS break\
    \ bit MUST be set.\n   Similarly both break bits MUST be set if reservations are\
    \ honored,\n   but sufficient resources to avoid congestion loss are not allocated\n\
    \   in practice.  If the service break bits are not set, then the\n   corresponding\
    \ service hop counters, <2,4>, <5,4>, MUST be\n   incremented.\n   The Available\
    \ Path Bandwidth (APB) parameters <x,6> indicate the\n   minimum physical bottleneck\
    \ rate along the path.  This may be\n   discoverable in an ATM network as the\
    \ negotiated PCR value for any\n   UBR VC along the same path.  This value MUST\
    \ be corrected for AAL,\n   ATM and physical-layer headers, as necessary, to reflect\
    \ the\n   effective IP datagram bandwidth.  With ATM, it is possible that there\n\
    \   is some policy limitation on the value of PCR, below the physical\n   link\
    \ bottleneck.  In this case, the advertised value of APB (in\n   general, and\
    \ for each service if the values of APB signalled are\n   service specific) MUST\
    \ reflect this limit, since excess traffic\n   beyond this rate will be dropped.\
    \  (Note that there is no tagging of\n   traffic in excess of PCR for TM/UNI 4.0.)\
    \  These values SHOULD\n   generally be cached by the ingress router for the set\
    \ of egress\n   routers with which it typically needs to establish VCs.  The APB\n\
    \   parameters are only adjusted down, to reflect the minimum as the\n   composed\
    \ value.\n   In the case of a multipoint VC, several parameters can be different\n\
    \   for each egress point, e.g., because the characteristics of the\n   physical\
    \ links of the VC branches differ.  When this occurs, the IWF\n   at the egress\
    \ routers MUST correct these values in PATH messages as\n   they exit the ATM\
    \ network.  (We use the word \"correct\" because the\n   ingress router SHOULD\
    \ set the parameters to a value that is\n   appropriate for the largest number\
    \ of branches, or a value that would\n   do the least harm if the egress routers\
    \ failed to correct such\n   parameters for each branch.)  This is the only case\
    \ where the egress\n   router needs to operate on rsvp control messages.  (A similar\n\
    \   correction MUST be implemented for any non-rsvp set-up mechanism).\n   The\
    \ parameters for which such correction is REQUIRED are the\n   Available Path\
    \ Bandwidth (APB), the Minimum Path Latency (MPL), the\n   Path MTU (although\
    \ for ATM/AAL-5 this may typically be constant), and\n   the ATM-specific components\
    \ of the GS Adspec parameters C_ATM and\n   D_ATM.\n   The ingress router table\
    \ SHOULD store values for the ATM-network MPL\n   <x,7> for the various egress\
    \ points.  The composed values <x,8> are\n   formed by addition and forwarded\
    \ along the path.  In the cases where\n   ATM routing chooses different paths,\
    \ depending on the service\n   category, for VCs to a given egress point, the\
    \ table will generally\n   reflect different values for each service.  If the\
    \ ATM network is\n   very large and complex, it may become difficult to predict\
    \ the routes\n   that VCs will take once they are set up.  This could be a significant\n\
    \   source of misconfiguration, resulting in discrepancies between GS\n   delay\
    \ advertisements and actual results.  The RSpec Slack term may be\n   useful in\
    \ mitigating this problem.\n   AAL-5 will support any message size up to 65,535\
    \ bytes, so setting\n   the AAL SDU to the receiver TSpec M parameter value (plus\
    \ 8 bytes for\n   the LLC/SNAP header) will generally not be an issue.  In the\
    \ PATH\n   Adspec, however, the PATH_MTU parameter <x,10> for each service\n \
    \  SHOULD be set to 9188 bytes, which is the default MTU for AAL-5 [19].\n"
- title: 3.2 Handling of Excess Traffic
  contents:
  - "3.2 Handling of Excess Traffic\n   For IP Integrated Services, network elements\
    \ will transport traffic\n   in excess of the TSpec parameters whenever physical\
    \ resources\n   (bandwidth, buffers and processing) are available.  (In CLS a\n\
    \   \"network element MUST attempt to forward the excess traffic on a\n   best-effort\
    \ basis\" under certain conditions; and in GS a traffic\n   policers \"SHOULD\
    \ relegate non-conforming datagrams to best effort\".)\n   While excess traffic\
    \ SHOULD be supported on a best effort basis, it\n   MUST NOT interfere with the\
    \ QoS (delay and loss) of conforming CLS\n   and GS traffic, nor with normal service\
    \ of non-reserved best effort\n   traffic.\n   There are several solutions with\
    \ ATM: the most attractive is to use a\n   VBR service category (with an appropriate\
    \ conformance definition) and\n   tag excess traffic as low priority using the\
    \ CLP bit.  This avoids\n   reordering of the flow, but necessitates careful design\
    \ of the egress\n   router scheduler.  To avoid reordering, the excess traffic\
    \ can be\n   queued with conforming traffic.  A threshold SHOULD be used to ensure\n\
    \   that conforming traffic is not unnecessarily delayed by the excess.\n   Also,\
    \ for GS, the extra delay that would be incurred due to excess\n   traffic in\
    \ the queue ahead of conforming packets would have to be\n   accurately reflected\
    \ in the delay advertisement.  Note that the\n   ingress router SHOULD tag all\
    \ cells of each non-conforming packet,\n   rather than letting the ATM network\
    \ apply tagging due to ATM-level\n   non-conformance.\n   There is no requirement\
    \ in ATM standards that tagged cells, marked\n   either by the user or by policing,\
    \ be transported if possible.\n   Therefore, the operator of an edge router supporting\
    \ IP-IS SHOULD\n   ascertain the actual behavior of the ATM equipment in the path,\
    \ which\n   may span multiple administrative domains in the ATM network.  If\n\
    \   tagged cells are simply dropped at some point, regardless of load,\n   then\
    \ the operator may consider setting the break bit, at least for\n   CLS service.\n\
    \   The other solutions generally involve a separate VC to carry the\n   excess.\
    \  A distinct VC can be set up for each VC supporting a GS or\n   CLS flow, or,\
    \ if many flows are aggregated into a single QoS VC, then\n   another VC can handle\
    \ the excess traffic for that set of flows.  A VC\n   can be set up to handle\
    \ all excess traffic from the ingress router to\n   the egress point.  Since the\
    \ QoS of the excess traffic is not\n   particularly constrained, the design is\
    \ quite flexible.  However,\n   using a separate VC may cause misordering of packets\
    \ within a flow.\n   The service category for the excess-traffic VC may typically\
    \ be UBR\n   or ABR, although one could use CBR or nrtVBR if the excess traffic\n\
    \   were predictable enough to know what rate to allocate.  (This\n   wouldn't\
    \ normally be expected for excess traffic, though.)\n   Whether a separate VC\
    \ is used may be influenced by the design of the\n   router scheduler.  The CLS\
    \ spec suggests two possible\n   implementations: one where excess traffic shares\
    \ the Best Effort\n   class scheduler allocation, but at lower priority than other\
    \ best\n   effort traffic.  The other, where a separate allocation is made.  The\n\
    \   first would allow excess traffic to use the same VC as normal best\n   effort\
    \ traffic, and the second would suggest a separate VC.\n   TM/UNI 4.0. does not\
    \ support tagging of traffic in excess of PCR.\n   Although UNI 3.x does have\
    \ a separate PCR parameter for CLP=0 cells\n   only, we do not recommend using\
    \ this feature for reasons of\n   interoperability with TM/UNI 4.0 equipment.\
    \  This restricts CBR VCs\n   to use solutions other than tagging.  The value\
    \ of PCR can be set\n   higher than necessary for conformant traffic, in an effort\
    \ to support\n   excess traffic on the same VC.  In some cases this may be a viable\n\
    \   solution, such as when there is little additional cost imposed for a\n   high\
    \ PCR.  If PCR can be set as high as APB, then the excess traffic\n   is fully\

    \ delays.  (We neglect the\n   effect of maximum packet size and peak rate here;\
    \ see the GS\n   specification [8] for a more detailed equation.)  The service\
    \ rate\n   requested by the receiver, R, can be greater than the TSpec rate,\n\
    \   r_r, resulting in lower delay.  The burst size, b_r, is the leaky\n   bucket\
    \ parameter from the receiver TSpec.\n   The values of C and D that a router advertises\
    \ depend on both the\n   router packet scheduler and the characteristics of the\
    \ subnet\n   attached to the router.  Each router (or the source host) takes\n\
    \   responsibility for its downstream subnet in its advertisement.  For\n   example,\
    \ if the subnet is a simple point-to-point link, the subnet-\n   specific parts\
    \ of C and D need to account for the link transmission\n   rate and MTU.  An ATM\
    \ subnet is generally more complex.\n   For this discussion, we consider only\
    \ the ATM subnet-specific\n   components, denoted C_ATM and D_ATM.  The ATM network\
    \ can be\n   represented as a \"pure delay\" element, where the variable queueing\n\
    \   delay, given by CVD is captured in D_ATM, and C_ATM is set to zero.\n   It\
    \ is possible to use C_ATM only when the ATM service rate equals R.\n   This may\
    \ be the case, for example with a CBR VC with PCR = R.\n   Usually it will be\
    \ simpler to just advertise the total delay\n   variation (CDV) in D_ATM.\n  \
    \ As discussed in Section 2.6, the edge router keeps a table with\n   values of\
    \ MPL and D_ATM for each egress router it needs to share VCs\n   with.  The value\
    \ of D_ATM contributes to the D parameter advertised\n   by the edge router, and\
    \ SHOULD accurately reflect the CDV that the\n   router will get in a VC when\
    \ it is set up.  Factors that affect CDV,\n   such as statistical multiplexing\
    \ in the ATM network, SHOULD be taken\n   into account when compiling data for\
    \ the router's table.  In case of\n   uncertainty, D_ATM can be set to an upper\
    \ bound.  When an RESV\n   message arrives, causing a VC to be set up, the requested\
    \ values for\n   CTD and CDV can be relaxed using the slack term in the receiver\n\
    \   RSpec:\n        CTD = D_ATM + MPL + S_ATM\n        CDV = D_ATM + S_ATM.\n\
    \   The term S_ATM is the portion of the slack term applied to the ATM\n   portion\
    \ of the path.  Recall that the slack term [8] is positive when\n   the receiver\
    \ can afford more delay than that computed from the\n   Adspec.  The ATM edge\
    \ device may take part (or all) of the slack\n   term, S.  The distribution of\
    \ delay slack among the nodes and subnets\n   is network specific.\n   Note that\
    \ with multipoint VCs the egress edge router may need to\n   correct advertised\
    \ values of C and D.  See discussion in Section 3.1.\n"

    \ for Best Effort IP service over\n   ATM.\n   The best-matched ATM service category\
    \ to IP Best Effort is UBR.  We\n   provide the setup details for this case below.\
    \  The BE service does\n   not involve reservation of resources.  ABR and nrtVBR\
    \ are also well\n   suited to BE service.  See discussion in Section 2.1.3.\n\
    \   Note, VCs supporting best effort service are usually point to point,\n   rather\
    \ than point to multipoint, and the backward channels of VCs are\n   used.  In\
    \ cases where VCs are set up to support best effort multicast\n   sessions, multipoint\

  contents:
  - "8.0 Security Considerations\n   IP Integrated Services (including rsvp) and ATM\
    \ are both complex\n   resource reservation protocols, and SHOULD be expected\
    \ to have\n   complex feature interactions.\n   Differences in IP and ATM billing\
    \ styles could cause unforeseen\n   problems since RESV messages can set up VCs.\
    \  For example, an end-\n   user paying a flat rate for (non-rsvp aware) internet\
    \ service may\n   send an rsvp RESV message that encounters a (perhaps distant)\
    \ ATM\n   network with a usage-sensitive billing model.  Insufficient\n   authentication\
    \ could result in services being accidentally billed to\n   an innocent third\
    \ party, intentional theft of service, or malicious\n   denial of service attacks\
    \ where high volumes of reservations consume\n   transport or processing resources\
    \ at the edge devices.\n   The difference in styles of handling excess traffic\
    \ could result in\n   denial of service attacks where the ATM network uses transport\n\
    \   resources (bandwidth, buffers) or connection processing resources\n   (switch\
    \ processor cycles) in an attempt to accommodate excess traffic\n   that was admitted\
    \ by the internet service.\n   Problems associated with translation of resource\
    \ reservations at edge\n   devices are probably more complex and susceptible to\
    \ abuse when the\n   IP-ATM edge is also an administrative boundary between service\n\
    \   providers.  Note also that administrative boundaries can exist within\n  \
    \ the ATM cloud, i.e., the ingress and egress edge devices are operated\n   by\
    \ different service providers.\n   Note, the ATM Forum Security Working Group\
    \ is currently defining\n   ATM-level security features such as data encryption\
    \ and signalling\n   authentication.  See also the security issues raised in the\
    \ rsvp\n   specification [3].\n"
