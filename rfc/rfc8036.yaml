  - "2.  Routing Protocol for LLNs (RPL)\n   RPL provides routing functionality for\
    \ mesh networks that can scale\n   up to thousands of resource-constrained devices\

    \ the\n   external network infrastructure through a common aggregation point(s)\n\

    \ metrics and policies.\n   RPL was designed to operate in energy-constrained\
    \ environments and\n   includes energy-saving mechanisms (e.g., Trickle timers)\
    \ and energy-\n   aware metrics.  RPL's ability to support multiple different\

- title: 3.  Description of AMI Networks for Electric Meters
  contents:
  - "3.  Description of AMI Networks for Electric Meters\n   In many deployments,\
    \ in addition to measuring energy consumption, the\n   electric meter network\
    \ plays a central role in the Smart Grid since\n   the device enables the utility\
    \ company to control and query the\n   electric meters themselves and can serve\
    \ as a backhaul for all other\n   devices in the Smart Grid, e.g., water and gas\
    \ meters, distribution\n   automation, and HAN devices.  Electric meters may also\
    \ be used as\n   sensors to monitor electric grid quality and to support applications\n\
    \   such as electric vehicle charging.\n   Electric meter networks can be composed\
    \ of millions of smart meters\n   (or nodes), each of which is resource constrained\
    \ in terms of\n   processing power, storage capabilities, and communication bandwidth\n\
    \   due to a combination of factors including regulations on spectrum\n   use;\
    \ on meter behavior and performance; and on heat emissions within\n   the meter,\
    \ form factor, and cost considerations.  These constraints\n   result in a compromise\
    \ between range and throughput with effective\n   link throughput of tens to a\
    \ few hundred kilobits per second per\n   link, a potentially significant portion\
    \ of which is taken up by\n   protocol and encryption overhead when strong security\
    \ measures are in\n   place.\n   Electric meters are often interconnected into\
    \ multi-hop mesh\n   networks, each of which is connected to a backhaul network\
    \ leading to\n   the utility company network through a network aggregation point,\n\
    \   e.g., an LBR.\n"
- title: 3.1.  Deployment Scenarios
  contents:
  - "3.1.  Deployment Scenarios\n   AMI networks are composed of millions of endpoints\
    \ distributed across\n   both urban and rural environments.  Such endpoints can\
    \ include\n   electric, gas, and water meters; distribution automation elements;\n\
    \   and HAN devices.\n   Devices in the network communicate directly with other\
    \ devices in\n   close proximity using a variety of low-power and/or lossy link\n\

    \   A typical AMI network architecture (see Figure 1) is composed of a\n   Meter\
    \ Data Management System (MDMS) connected through an IP network\n   to an LBR,\
    \ which can be located in the power substation or somewhere\n   else in the field.\
    \  The power substation connects the households and\n   buildings.  The physical\
    \ topology of the electrical grid is a tree\n   structure, either due to the three\
    \ different power phases coming\n   through the substation or just to the electrical\
    \ network topology.\n   Meters (represented by a M in the previous figure) can\
    \ also\n   participate in a HAN.  The scope of this document is the\n   communication\
    \ between the LBR and the meters, i.e., the NAN segment.\n   Node density can\
    \ vary significantly.  For example, apartment\n   buildings in urban centers may\
    \ have hundreds of meters in close\n   proximity, whereas rural areas may have\
    \ sparse node distributions and\n   may include nodes that only have a small number\
    \ of network neighbors.\n   Each routing domain is connected to the larger IP\
    \ infrastructure\n   through one or more LBRs, which provide Wide Area Network\
    \ (WAN)\n   connectivity through various traditional network technologies, e.g.,\n\
    \   Ethernet, cellular, private WAN based on Worldwide Interoperability\n   for\
    \ Microwave Access (WiMAX), and optical fiber.  Paths in the mesh\n   between\
    \ a network node and the nearest LBR may be composed of several\n   hops or even\
    \ several tens of hops.  Powered from the main line,\n   electric meters have\
    \ less energy constraints than battery powered\n   devices, such as gas and water\
    \ meters, and can afford the additional\n   resources required to route packets.\n\
    \   As a function of the technology used to exchange information, the\n   logical\
    \ network topology will not necessarily match the electric grid\n   topology.\
    \  If meters exchange information through radio technologies\n   such as in the\
    \ IEEE 802.15.4 family, then the topology is a meshed\n   network where nodes\
    \ belonging to the same Destination-Oriented DAG\n   (DODAG) can be connected\
    \ to the grid through different substations.\n   If narrowband PLC technology\
    \ is used, it will more or less follow the\n   physical tree structure since crosstalk\
    \ may allow one phase to\n   communicate with the other.  This is particularly\
    \ true near the LBR.\n   Some mixed topology can also be observed since some LBRs\
    \ may be\n   strategically installed in the field to avoid all the communications\n\
    \   going through a single LBR.  Nevertheless, the short propagation\n   range\
    \ forces meters to relay the information.\n"

- title: 4.1.  Smart Grid Traffic Characteristics
  contents:
  - "4.1.  Smart Grid Traffic Characteristics\n   In current AMI deployments, metering\
    \ applications typically require\n   all smart meters to communicate with a few\
    \ head-end servers that are\n   deployed in the utility company data center. \
    \ Head-end servers\n   generate data traffic to configure smart data reading or\
    \ initiate\n   queries and use unicast and multicast to efficiently communicate\
    \ with\n   a single device (i.e., Point-to-Point (P2P) communications) or groups\n\
    \   of devices respectively (i.e., Point-to-Multipoint (P2MP)\n   communication).\
    \  The head-end server may send a single small packet\n   at a time to the meters\
    \ (e.g., a meter read request, a small\n   configuration change, or a service-switch\
    \ command) or a series of\n   large packets (e.g., a firmware download across\
    \ one or even thousands\n   of devices).  The frequency of large file transfers\
    \ (e.g., firmware\n   download of all metering devices) is typically much lower\
    \ than the\n   frequency of sending configuration messages or queries.  Each smart\n\
    \   meter generates Smart Metering Data (SMD) traffic according to a\n   schedule\
    \ (e.g., periodic meter reads) in response to on-demand\n   queries (e.g., on-demand\
    \ meter reads) or in response to some local\n   event (e.g., power outage or leak\
    \ detection).  Such traffic is\n   typically destined to a single head-end server.\
    \  The SMD traffic is\n   thus highly asymmetric, where the majority of the traffic\
    \ volume\n   generated by the smart meters typically goes through the LBRs, and\
    \ is\n   directed from the smart meter devices to the head-end servers in a\n\
    \   Mesh Peer-to-Peer (MP2P) fashion.  Current SMD traffic patterns are\n   fairly\
    \ uniform and well understood.  The traffic generated by the\n   head-end server\
    \ and destined to metering devices is dominated by\n   periodic meter reads while\
    \ traffic generated by the metering devices\n   is typically uniformly spread\
    \ over some periodic read time-window.\n   Smart metering applications typically\
    \ do not have hard real-time\n   constraints, but they are often subject to bounded\
    \ latency and\n   stringent service level agreements about reliability.\n   Distribution\
    \ Automation (DA) applications typically involve a small\n   number of devices\
    \ that communicate with each other in a P2P fashion\n   and may or may not be\
    \ in close physical proximity.  DA applications\n   typically have more stringent\
    \ latency requirements than SMD\n   applications.\n   There are also a number\
    \ of emerging applications such as electric\n   vehicle charging.  These applications\
    \ may require P2P communication\n   and may eventually have more stringent latency\
    \ requirements than SMD\n   applications.\n"

    \ B1)  request is sent in P2P to a specific meter\n      B2)  request is sent\

    \ this end, RPL builds a Directed Acyclic\n      Graph (DAG) rooted at each LBR.\n\
    \   o  Zero-touch configuration: This is done through in-band methods for\n  \
    \    configuring RPL variables using DIO (DODAG Information Object)\n      messages\
    \ and DIO message options [RFC6550].\n   o  The use of links with time-varying\

    \ and\n   availability, AMI deployments SHOULD utilize the local repair\n   mechanisms\
    \ in RPL.  Local repair is triggered by broken link\n   detection.  The first\
    \ local repair mechanism consists of a node\n   detaching from a DODAG and then\
    \ reattaching to the same or to a\n   different DODAG at a later time.  While\
    \ detached, a node advertises\n   an infinite rank value so that its children\
    \ can select a different\n   parent.  This process is known as \"poisoning\" and\
    \ is described in\n   Section 8.2.2.5 of [RFC6550].  While RPL provides an option\
    \ to form a\n   local DODAG, doing so in AMI for electric meters is of little\
    \ benefit\n   since AMI applications typically communicate through an LBR.  After\n\
    \   the detached node has made sufficient effort to send a notification\n   to\
    \ its children that it is detached, the node can rejoin the same\n   DODAG with\
    \ a higher rank value.  The configured duration of the\n   poisoning mechanism\
    \ needs to take into account the disconnection time\n   that applications running\
    \ over the network can tolerate.  Note that\n   when joining a different DODAG,\
    \ the node need not perform poisoning.\n   The second local repair mechanism controls\
    \ how much a node can\n   increase its rank within a given DODAG version (e.g.,\
    \ after detaching\n   from the DODAG as a result of broken link or loop detection).\n\
    \   Setting the DAGMaxRankIncrease to a non-zero value enables this\n   mechanism,\
    \ and setting it to a value of less than infinity limits the\n   cost of count-to-infinity\
    \ scenarios when they occur, thus controlling\n   the duration of disconnection\

  contents:
  - "7.2.1.  IEEE 1901.2 PHY and MAC Sub-layer Features\n   The IEEE Std 1901.2 PHY\
    \ layer is based on OFDM modulation and defines\n   a time frequency interleaver\
    \ over the entire PHY frame coupled with a\n   Reed Solomon and Viterbi Forward\
    \ Error Correction for maximum\n   robustness.  Since the noise level in each\
    \ OFDM subcarrier can vary\n   significantly, IEEE 1901.2 specifies two complementary\
    \ mechanisms\n   that allow fine-tuning of the robustness/performance tradeoff\n\
    \   implicit in such systems.  More specifically, the first (coarse-\n   grained)\
    \ mechanism defines the modulation from several possible\n   choices (robust (super-ROBO,\
    \ ROBO), BPSK, QPSK, and so on).  The\n   second (fine-grained) mechanism maps\
    \ the subcarriers that are too\n   noisy and deactivates them.\n   The existence\
    \ of multiple modulations and dynamic frequency exclusion\n   renders the problem\
    \ of selecting a path between two nodes non-trivial\n   as the possible number\
    \ of combinations increases significantly, e.g.,\n   use a direct link with slow\
    \ robust modulation or use a relay meter\n   with fast modulation and 12 disabled\
    \ subcarriers.  In addition, IEEE\n   1901.2 technology offers a mechanism (adaptive\
    \ tone map) for periodic\n   exchanges on the link quality between nodes to constantly\
    \ react to\n   channel fluctuations.  Every meter keeps a state of the quality\
    \ of\n   the link to each of its neighbors by either piggybacking the tone\n \
    \  mapping on the data traffic or by sending explicit tone map requests.\n   The\
    \ IEEE 1901.2 MAC frame format shares most in common with the IEEE\n   802.15.4\
    \ MAC frame format [IEEE.802.15.4].  A few exceptions are\n   described below.\n\
    \   o  The IEEE 1901.2 MAC frame is obtained by prepending a Segment\n      Control\
    \ Field to the IEEE 802.15.4 MAC header.  One function of\n      the Segment Control\
    \ Field is to signal the use of the MAC\n      sub-layer segmentation and reassembly.\n\
    \   o  IEEE 1901.2 MAC frames use only the 802.15.4 MAC addresses with a\n   \
    \   length of 16 and 64 bits.\n   o  The IEEE 1901.2 MAC sub-layer endorses the\
    \ concept of Information\n      Elements, as defined in [IEEE.802.15.4e].  The\
    \ format and use of\n      Information Elements are not relevant to the RPL applicability\n\
    \      statement.\n   The IEEE 1901.2 PHY frame payload size varies as a function\
    \ of the\n   modulation used to transmit the frame and the strength of the Forward\n\
    \   Error Correction scheme.\n   The IEEE 1901.2 PHY MTU size is variable and\
    \ dependent on the PHY\n   settings in use (e.g., bandwidth, modulation, tones,\
    \ etc).  As quoted\n   from the IEEE 1901.2 specification:\n      For CENELEC\
    \ A/B, if MSDU size is more than 247 octets for robust\n      OFDM (ROBO) and\
    \ Super-ROBO modulations or more than 239 octets for\n      all other modulations,\
    \ the MAC layer shall divide the MSDU into\n      multiple segments as described\
    \ in 5.3.7.  For FCC and ARIB, if the\n      MSDU size meets one of the following\
    \ conditions: a) For ROBO and\n      Super-ROBO modulations, the MSDU size is\
    \ more than 247 octets but\n      less than 494 octets, b) For all other modulations,\

  - "7.2.3.  IEEE MAC Sub-layer Security Features\n   Since the IEEE 1901.2 standard\
    \ is based on the 802.15.4 MAC sub-layer\n   and fully endorses the security scheme\
    \ defined in 802.15.4, we only\n   focus on the description of the IEEE 802.15.4\
    \ security scheme.\n   The IEEE 802.15.4 specification was designed to support\
    \ a variety of\n   applications, many of which are security sensitive.  IEEE 802.15.4\n\
    \   provides four basic security services: message authentication,\n   message\
    \ integrity, message confidentiality, and freshness checks to\n   avoid replay\
    \ attacks.\n   The 802.15.4 security layer is handled at the media access control\n\
    \   layer, below the 6LowPAN (IPv6 over Low-Power Wireless Personal Area\n   Network)\
    \ layer.  The application specifies its security requirements\n   by setting the\
    \ appropriate control parameters into the radio/PLC\n   stack.  IEEE 802.15.4\
    \ defines four packet types: beacon frames, data\n   frames, acknowledgment frames,\
    \ and command frames for the media\n   access control layer.  The 802.15.4 specification\
    \ does not support\n   security for acknowledgement frames; data frames, beacon\
    \ frames, and\n   command frames can support integrity protection and confidentiality\n\
    \   protection for the frames' data field.  An application has a choice\n   of\
    \ security suites that control the type of security protection that\n   is provided\
    \ for the transmitted MAC frame.  Each security suite\n   offers a different set\
    \ of security properties and guarantees, and\n   ultimately offers different MAC\
    \ frame formats.  The 802.15.4\n   specification defines eight different security\
    \ suites, outlined\n   below.  We can broadly classify the suites by the properties\
    \ that\n   they offer: no security, encryption only (AES-CTR), authentication\n\
    \   only (AES-CBC-MAC), and encryption and authentication (AES-CCM).\n   Each\
    \ category that supports authentication comes in three variants\n   depending\
    \ on the size of the Message Authentication Code that it\n   offers.  The MAC\
    \ can be either 4, 8, or 16 bytes long.  Additionally,\n   for each suite that\
    \ offers encryption, the recipient can optionally\n   enable replay protection.\n\
    \   o  Null = No security\n   o  AES-CTR = Encryption only, CTR mode\n   o  AES-CBC-MAC-128\
    \ = No encryption, 128-bit MAC\n   o  AES-CBC-MAC-64 = No encryption, 64-bit MAC\n\
    \   o  AES-CCM-128 = Encryption and 128-bit MAC\n   o  AES-CCM-64 = Encryption\
    \ and 64-bit MAC\n   o  AES-CCM-32 = Encryption and 32-bit MAC\n   Note that AES-CCM-32\
    \ is the most commonly used cipher in these\n   deployments today.\n   To achieve\
    \ authentication, any device can maintain an Access Control\n   List (ACL), which\
    \ is a list of trusted nodes from which the device\n   wishes to receive data.\
    \  Data encryption is done by encryption of\n   Message Authentication Control\
    \ frame payload using the key shared\n   between two devices or among a group\
    \ of peers.  If the key is to be\n   shared between two peers, it is stored with\
    \ each entry in the ACL\n   list; otherwise, the key is stored as the default\
    \ key.  Thus, the\n   device can make sure that its data cannot be read by devices\
    \ that do\n   not possess the corresponding key.  However, device addresses are\n\
    \   always transmitted unencrypted, which makes attacks that rely on\n   device\
    \ identity somewhat easier to launch.  Integrity service is\n   applied by appending\
    \ a Message Integrity Code (MIC) generated from\n   blocks of encrypted message\
    \ text.  This ensures that a frame cannot\n   be modified by a receiver device\
    \ that does not share a key with the\n   sender.  Finally, sequential freshness\
    \ uses a frame counter and key\n   sequence counter to ensure the freshness of\
    \ the incoming frame and\n   guard against replay attacks.\n   A cryptographic\
    \ Message Authentication Code (or keyed MIC) is used to\n   authenticate messages.\
    \  While longer MICs lead to improved resiliency\n   of the code, they also make\
    \ the packet size larger and thus take up\n   bandwidth in the network.  In constrained\
    \ environments such as\n   metering infrastructures, an optimum balance between\
    \ security\n   requirements and network throughput must be found.\n"

  contents:
  - "7.4.1.  Trickle Parameters\n   Trickle [RFC6206] was designed to be density aware\
    \ and perform well\n   in networks characterized by a wide range of node densities.\
    \  The\n   combination of DIO packet suppression and adaptive timers for sending\n\
    \   updates allows Trickle to perform well in both sparse and dense\n   environments.\
    \  Node densities in AMI deployments can vary greatly,\n   from nodes having only\
    \ one or a handful of neighbors to nodes having\n   several hundred neighbors.\
    \  In high-density environments, relatively\n   low values for Imin may cause\
    \ a short period of congestion when an\n   inconsistency is detected and DIO updates\
    \ are sent by a large number\n   of neighboring nodes nearly simultaneously. \
    \ While the Trickle timer\n   will exponentially backoff, some time may elapse\
    \ before the\n   congestion subsides.  While some link layers employ contention\n\
    \   mechanisms that attempt to avoid congestion, relying solely on the\n   link\
    \ layer to avoid congestion caused by a large number of DIO\n   updates can result\
    \ in increased communication latency for other\n   control and data traffic in\
    \ the network.  To mitigate this kind of\n   short-term congestion, this document\
    \ recommends a more conservative\n   set of values for the Trickle parameters\
    \ than those specified in\n   [RFC6206].  In particular, DIOIntervalMin is set\
    \ to a larger value to\n   avoid periods of congestion in dense environments,\
    \ and\n   DIORedundancyConstant is parameterized accordingly as described\n  \
    \ below.  These values are appropriate for the timely distribution of\n   DIO\
    \ updates in both sparse and dense scenarios while avoiding the\n   short-term\
    \ congestion that might arise in dense scenarios.  Because\n   the actual link\
    \ capacity depends on the particular link technology\n   used within an AMI deployment,\
    \ the Trickle parameters are specified\n   in terms of the link's maximum capacity\
    \ for transmitting link-local\n   multicast messages.  If the link can transmit\
    \ m link-local multicast\n   packets per second on average, the expected time\

    \ is at least 50 times as long as it takes to\n      transmit a link-local multicast\
    \ packet.  This value is larger than\n      that recommended in [RFC6206] to avoid\
    \ congestion in dense urban\n      deployments as described above.\n   DIOIntervalDoublings:\
    \  AMI deployments SHOULD set\n      DIOIntervalDoublings such that the Trickle\
    \ Imax is at least 2\n      hours or more.\n   DIORedundancyConstant:  AMI deployments\
    \ SHOULD set\n      DIORedundancyConstant to a value of at least 10.  This is\
    \ due to\n      the larger chosen value for DIOIntervalMin and the proportional\n\
    \      relationship between Imin and k suggested in [RFC6206].  This\n      increase\
    \ is intended to compensate for the increased communication\n      latency of\
    \ DIO updates caused by the increase in the\n      DIOIntervalMin value, though\
    \ the proportional relationship between\n      Imin and k suggested in [RFC6206]\
    \ is not preserved.  Instead,\n      DIORedundancyConstant is set to a lower value\
    \ in order to reduce\n      the number of packet transmissions in dense environments.\n"

- title: 8.  Manageability Considerations
  contents:
  - "8.  Manageability Considerations\n   Network manageability is a critical aspect\
    \ of smart grid network\n   deployment and operation.  With millions of devices\
    \ participating in\n   the smart grid network, many requiring real-time reachability,\n\
    \   automatic configuration, and lightweight-network health monitoring\n   and\
    \ management are crucial for achieving network availability and\n   efficient\
    \ operation.  RPL enables automatic and consistent\n   configuration of RPL routers\
    \ through parameters specified by the\n   DODAG root and disseminated through\
    \ DIO packets.  The use of Trickle\n   for scheduling DIO transmissions ensures\
    \ lightweight yet timely\n   propagation of important network and parameter updates\
    \ and allows\n   network operators to choose the trade-off point with which they\
    \ are\n   comfortable with respect to overhead vs. reliability and timeliness\n\
    \   of network updates.  The metrics in use in the network along with the\n  \
    \ Trickle Timer parameters used to control the frequency and redundancy\n   of\
    \ network updates can be dynamically varied by the root during the\n   lifetime\
    \ of the network.  To that end, all DIO messages SHOULD\n   contain a Metric Container\
    \ option for disseminating the metrics and\n   metric values used for DODAG setup.\
    \  In addition, DIO messages SHOULD\n   contain a DODAG Configuration option for\
    \ disseminating the Trickle\n   Timer parameters throughout the network.  The\
    \ possibility of\n   dynamically updating the metrics in use in the network as\
    \ well as the\n   frequency of network updates allows deployment characteristics\
    \ (e.g.,\n   network density) to be discovered during network bring-up and to\
    \ be\n   used to tailor network parameters once the network is operational\n \
    \  rather than having to rely on precise pre-configuration.  This also\n   allows\
    \ the network parameters and the overall routing protocol\n   behavior to evolve\
    \ during the lifetime of the network.  RPL specifies\n   a number of variables\
    \ and events that can be tracked for purposes of\n   network fault and performance\
    \ monitoring of RPL routers.  Depending\n   on the memory and processing capabilities\
    \ of each smart grid device,\n   various subsets of these can be employed in the\
    \ field.\n"
- title: 9.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "9.  Security Considerations\n   Smart grid networks are subject to stringent\
    \ security requirements,\n   as they are considered a critical infrastructure\
    \ component.  At the\n   same time, they are composed of large numbers of resource-constrained\n\
    \   devices interconnected with limited-throughput links.  As a result,\n   the\
    \ choice of security mechanisms is highly dependent on the device\n   and network\
    \ capabilities characterizing a particular deployment.\n   In contrast to other\
    \ types of LLNs, in smart grid networks both\n   centralized administrative control\
    \ and access to a permanent secure\n   infrastructure are available.  As a result,\
    \ smart grid networks are\n   deployed with security mechanisms such as link-layer,\
    \ transport-\n   layer, and/or application-layer security mechanisms; while it\
    \ is best\n   practice to secure all layers, using RPL's secure mode may not be\n\
    \   necessary.  Failure to protect any of these layers can result in\n   various\
    \ attacks; a lack of strong authentication of devices in the\n   infrastructure\
    \ can lead to uncontrolled and unauthorized access.\n   Similarly, failure to\
    \ protect the communication layers can enable\n   passive (in wireless mediums)\
    \ attacks as well as man-in-the-middle\n   and active attacks.\n   As this document\
    \ describes the applicability of RPL non-storing mode,\n   the security considerations\
    \ as defined in [RFC6550] also apply to\n   this document and to AMI deployments.\n"

  contents:
  - "9.1.  Security Considerations during Initial Deployment\n   During the manufacturing\
    \ process, the meters are loaded with the\n   appropriate security credentials\
    \ (keys and certificates).  The\n   configured security credentials during manufacturing\
    \ are used by the\n   devices to authenticate with the system and to further negotiate\n\
    \   operational security credentials for both network and application\n   layers.\n"
- title: 9.2.  Security Considerations during Incremental Deployment
  contents:
  - "9.2.  Security Considerations during Incremental Deployment\n   If during the\
    \ system operation a device fails or is known to be\n   compromised, it is replaced\
    \ with a new device.  The new device does\n   not take over the security identity\
    \ of the replaced device.  The\n   security credentials associated with the failed/compromised\
    \ device\n   are removed from the security appliances.\n"
- title: 9.3.  Security Considerations Based on RPL's Threat Analysis
  contents:
  - "9.3.  Security Considerations Based on RPL's Threat Analysis\n   [RFC7416] defines\
    \ a set of security considerations for RPL security.\n   This document defines\
    \ how it leverages the device's link-layer and\n   application-layer security\
    \ mechanisms to address the threats as\n   defined in Section 6 of [RFC7416].\n\
    \   Like any secure network infrastructure, an AMI deployment's ability\n   to\
    \ address node impersonation and active man-in-the-middle attacks\n   rely on\
    \ a mutual authentication and authorization process.  To enable\n   strong mutual\
    \ authentication, all nodes, from smart meters to nodes\n   in the infrastructure,\
    \ must have a credential.  The credential may be\n   bootstrapped at the time\
    \ the node is manufactured but must be\n   appropriately managed and classified\
    \ through the authorization\n   process.  The management and authorization process\
    \ ensures that the\n   nodes are properly authenticated and behaving or 'acting'\
    \ in their\n   assigned roles.\n   Similarly, to ensure that data has not been\
    \ modified, confidentiality\n   and integrity at the suitable layers (e.g., the\
    \ link layer, the\n   application layer, or both) should be used.\n   To provide\
    \ the security mechanisms to address these threats, an AMI\n   deployment MUST\
    \ include the use of the security schemes as defined by\n   IEEE 1901.2 (and IEEE\
    \ 802.15.4) with IEEE 802.15.4 defining the\n   security mechanisms to afford\
    \ mutual authentication, access control\n   (e.g., authorization), and transport\
    \ confidentiality and integrity.\n"
