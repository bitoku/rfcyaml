- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   zlib [RFC1950] and gzip [RFC1952] are widely used compression\n\
    \   formats. zlib is a stream format, while gzip adds header and trailer\n   fields\
    \ more appropriate for a file format.  Both implement the\n   DEFLATE compression\
    \ scheme described in [RFC1951].\n   They are used to compress a wide variety\
    \ of material, from\n   unstructured text to structured data to executable code.\n\
    \   Some applications have informally used media types such as\n   application/gzip-compressed,\
    \ application/gzipped, application/\n   x-gunzip, application/x-gzip, application/x-gzip-compressed,\
    \ and\n   gzip/document to describe data compressed with gzip.  The media types\n\
    \   defined in this document should replace those media types in future\n   applications.\n"
- title: 2.  The 'application/zlib' Media Type
  contents:
  - "2.  The 'application/zlib' Media Type\n   The 'application/zlib' media type describes\
    \ a block of data that is\n   compressed using zlib [RFC1950] compression.  The\
    \ data is a stream of\n   bytes as described in RFC 1950.\n"

- title: 4.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "4.  Security Considerations\n   zlib and gzip compression can be used to compress\
    \ arbitrary binary\n   data such as hostile executable code.  Also, data that\
    \ purports to be\n   in zlib or gzip format may not be, and fields that are supposed\
    \ to be\n   flags, lengths, or pointers could contain anything.  Applications\n\
    \   should treat any data with due skepticism.\n   Also see the security considerations\
    \ in the underlying format\n   documents: Section 5 of [RFC1950], Section 6 of\
    \ [RFC1951], and\n   Section 4 of [RFC1952].\n"
