- title: 1. Applicability Statement
  contents:
  - "1. Applicability Statement\n   This document describes private extensions to\
    \ SIP [1] that enable a\n   network of trusted SIP servers to assert the identity\
    \ of end users or\n   end systems, and to convey indications of end-user requested\
    \ privacy.\n   The use of these extensions is only applicable inside a 'Trust\n\
    \   Domain' as defined in Short term requirements for Network Asserted\n   Identity\
    \ [5].  Nodes in such a Trust Domain are explicitly trusted by\n   its users and\
    \ end-systems to publicly assert the identity of each\n   party, and to be responsible\
    \ for withholding that identity outside of\n   the Trust Domain when privacy is\
    \ requested.  The means by which the\n   network determines the identity to assert\
    \ is outside the scope of\n   this document (though it commonly entails some form\
    \ of\n   authentication).\n   A key requirement of [5] is that the behavior of\
    \ all nodes within a\n   given Trust Domain 'T' is known to comply to a certain\
    \ set of\n   specifications known as 'Spec(T)'.  Spec(T) MUST specify behavior\
    \ for\n   the following:\n   1. The manner in which users are authenticated\n\
    \   2. The mechanisms used to secure the communication among nodes within\n  \
    \    the Trust Domain\n   3. The mechanisms used to secure the communication between\
    \ UAs and\n      nodes within the Trust Domain\n   4. The manner used to determine\
    \ which hosts are part of the Trust\n      Domain\n   5. The default privacy handling\
    \ when no Privacy header field is\n      present\n   6. That nodes in the Trust\
    \ Domain are compliant to SIP [1]\n   7. That nodes in the Trust Domain are compliant\
    \ to this document\n   8. Privacy handling for identity as described in Section\
    \ 7.\n   An example of a suitable Spec(T) is shown in Section 11.\n   This document\
    \ does NOT offer a general privacy or identity model\n   suitable for inter-domain\
    \ use or use in the Internet at large.  Its\n   assumptions about the trust relationship\
    \ between the user and the\n   network may not apply in many applications.  For\
    \ example, these\n   extensions do not accommodate a model whereby end users can\n\
    \   independently assert their identity by use of the extensions defined\n   here.\
    \  Furthermore, since the asserted identities are not\n   cryptographically certified,\
    \ they are subject to forgery, replay, and\n   falsification in any architecture\
    \ that does not meet the requirements\n   of [5].\n   The asserted identities\
    \ also lack an indication of who specifically\n   is asserting the identity, and\
    \ so it must be assumed that the Trust\n   Domain is asserting the identity. \
    \ Therefore, the information is only\n   meaningful when securely received from\
    \ a node known to be a member of\n   the Trust Domain.\n   Despite these limitations,\
    \ there are sufficiently useful specialized\n   deployments that meet the assumptions\
    \ described above, and can accept\n   the limitations that result, to warrant\
    \ informational publication of\n   this mechanism.  An example deployment would\
    \ be a closed network\n   which emulates a traditional circuit switched telephone\
    \ network.\n"

- title: 3. Introduction
  contents:
  - "3. Introduction\n   Various providers offering a telephony service over IP networks\
    \ have\n   selected SIP as a call establishment protocol.  Their environments\n\
    \   require a way for trusted network elements operated by the service\n   providers\
    \ (for example SIP proxy servers) to communicate the identity\n   of the subscribers\
    \ to such a service, yet also need to withhold this\n   information from entities\
    \ that are not trusted when necessary.  Such\n   networks typically assume some\
    \ level of transitive trust amongst\n   providers and the devices they operate.\n\
    \   These networks need to support certain traditional telephony services\n  \
    \ and meet basic regulatory and public safety requirements.  These\n   include\
    \ Calling Identity Delivery services, Calling Identity Delivery\n   Blocking,\
    \ and the ability to trace the originator of a call.  While\n   baseline SIP can\
    \ support each of these services independently,\n   certain combinations cannot\
    \ be supported without the extensions\n   described in this document.  For example,\
    \ a caller that wants to\n   maintain privacy and consequently provides limited\
    \ information in the\n   SIP From header field will not be identifiable by recipients\
    \ of the\n   call unless they rely on some other means to discover the identity\
    \ of\n   the caller.  Masking identity information at the originating user\n \
    \  agent will prevent certain services, e.g., call trace, from working\n   in\
    \ the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) or being performed at\n   intermediaries\
    \ not privy to the authenticated identity of the user.\n   This document attempts\
    \ to provide a network asserted identity service\n   using a very limited, simple\
    \ mechanism, based on requirements in [5].\n   This work is derived from a previous\
    \ attempt, [6], to solve several\n   problems related to privacy and identity\
    \ in Trust Domains.  A more\n   comprehensive mechanism, [7] which uses cryptography\
    \ to address this\n   problem is the subject of current study by the SIP working\
    \ group.\n   Providing privacy in a SIP network is more complicated than in the\n\
    \   PSTN.  In SIP networks, the participants in a session are typically\n   able\
    \ to exchange IP traffic directly without involving any SIP\n   service provider.\
    \  The IP addresses used for these sessions may\n   themselves reveal private\
    \ information.  A general purpose mechanism\n   for providing privacy in a SIP\
    \ environment is discussed in [2].  This\n   document applies that privacy mechanism\
    \ to the problem of network\n   asserted identity.\n"
- title: 4. Overview
  contents:
  - "4. Overview\n   The mechanism proposed in this document relies on a new header\
    \ field\n   called 'P-Asserted-Identity' that contains a URI (commonly a SIP URI)\n\
    \   and an optional display-name, for example:\n      P-Asserted-Identity: \"\
    Cullen Jennings\" <sip:fluffy@cisco.com>\n   A proxy server which handles a message\
    \ can, after authenticating the\n   originating user in some way (for example:\
    \ Digest authentication),\n   insert such a P-Asserted-Identity header field into\
    \ the message and\n   forward it to other trusted proxies.  A proxy that is about\
    \ to\n   forward a message to a proxy server or UA that it does not trust MUST\n\
    \   remove all the P-Asserted-Identity header field values if the user\n   requested\
    \ that this information be kept private.  Users can request\n   this type of privacy\
    \ as described in Section 7.\n   The formal syntax for the P-Asserted-Identity\
    \ header is presented in\n   Section 9.\n"
- title: 5. Proxy Behavior
  contents:
  - "5. Proxy Behavior\n   A proxy in a Trust Domain can receive a message from a\
    \ node that it\n   trusts, or a node that it does not trust.  When a proxy receives\
    \ a\n   message from a node it does not trust and it wishes to add a P-\n   Asserted-Identity\
    \ header field, the proxy MUST authenticate the\n   originator of the message,\
    \ and use the identity which results from\n   this authentication to insert a\
    \ P-Asserted-Identity header field into\n   the message.\n   If the proxy receives\
    \ a message (request or response) from a node\n   that it trusts, it can use the\
    \ information in the P-Asserted-Identity\n   header field, if any, as if it had\
    \ authenticated the user itself.\n   If there is no P-Asserted-Identity header\
    \ field present, a proxy MAY\n   add one containing at most one SIP or SIPS URI,\
    \ and at most one tel\n   URL.  If the proxy received the message from an element\
    \ that it does\n   not trust and there is a P-Asserted-Identity header present\
    \ which\n   contains a SIP or SIPS URI, the proxy MUST replace that SIP or SIPS\n\
    \   URI with a single SIP or SIPS URI or remove this header field.\n   Similarly,\
    \ if the proxy received the message from an element that it\n   does not trust\
    \ and there is a P-Asserted-Identity header present\n   which contains a tel URI,\
    \ the proxy MUST replace that tel URI with a\n   single tel URI or remove the\
    \ header field.\n   When a proxy forwards a message to another node, it must first\n\
    \   determine if it trusts that node or not.  If it trusts the node, the\n   proxy\
    \ does not remove any P-Asserted-Identity header fields that it\n   generated\
    \ itself, or that it received from a trusted source.  If it\n   does not trust\
    \ the element, then the proxy MUST examine the Privacy\n   header field (if present)\
    \ to determine if the user requested that\n   asserted identity information be\
    \ kept private.\n"
- title: 6. Hints for Multiple Identities
  contents:
  - "6. Hints for Multiple Identities\n   If a P-Preferred-Identity header field is\
    \ present in the message that\n   a proxy receives from an entity that it does\
    \ not trust, the proxy MAY\n   use this information as a hint suggesting which\
    \ of multiple valid\n   identities for the authenticated user should be asserted.\
    \  If such a\n   hint does not correspond to any valid identity known to the proxy\
    \ for\n   that user, the proxy can add a P-Asserted-Identity header of its own\n\
    \   construction, or it can reject the request (for example, with a 403\n   Forbidden).\
    \  The proxy MUST remove the user-provided P-Preferred-\n   Identity header from\
    \ any message it forwards.\n   A user agent only sends a P-Preferred-Identity\
    \ header field to proxy\n   servers in a Trust Domain; user agents MUST NOT populate\
    \ the P-\n   Preferred-Identity header field in a message that is not sent\n \
    \  directly to a proxy that is trusted by the user agent.  Were a user\n   agent\
    \ to send a message containing a P-Preferred-Identity header\n   field to a node\
    \ outside a Trust Domain, then the hinted identity\n   might not be managed appropriately\
    \ by the network, which could have\n   negative ramifications for privacy.\n"
- title: 7. Requesting Privacy
  contents:
  - "7. Requesting Privacy\n   Parties who wish to request the removal of P-Asserted-Identity\
    \ header\n   fields before they are transmitted to an element that is not trusted\n\
    \   may add the \"id\" privacy token defined in this document to the\n   Privacy\
    \ header field.  The Privacy header field is defined in [6].\n   If this token\
    \ is present, proxies MUST remove all the P-Asserted-\n   Identity header fields\
    \ before forwarding messages to elements that\n   are not trusted.  If the Privacy\
    \ header field value is set to \"none\"\n   then the proxy MUST NOT remove the\
    \ P-Asserted-Identity header fields.\n   When a proxy is forwarding the request\
    \ to an element that is not\n   trusted and there is no Privacy header field,\
    \ the proxy MAY include\n   the P-Asserted-Identity header field or it MAY remove\
    \ it.  This\n   decision is a policy matter of the Trust Domain and MUST be specified\n\
    \   in Spec(T).  It is RECOMMENDED that the P-Asserted-Identity header\n   fields\
    \ SHOULD NOT be removed unless local privacy policies prevent\n   it, because\
    \ removal may cause services based on Asserted Identity to\n   fail.\n   However,\
    \ it should be noted that unless all users of the Trust Domain\n   have access\
    \ to appropriate privacy services, forwarding of the P-\n   Asserted-Identity\
    \ may result in disclosure of information which the\n   user has not requested\
    \ and cannot prevent.  It is therefore STRONGLY\n   RECOMMENDED that all users\
    \ have access to privacy services as\n   described in this document.\n   Formal\
    \ specification of the \"id\" Privacy header priv-value is\n   described in Section\
    \ 9.3.  Some general guidelines for when users\n   require privacy are given in\
    \ [2].\n   If multiple P-Asserted-Identity header field values are present in\
    \ a\n   message, and privacy of the P-Asserted-Identity header field is\n   requested,\
    \ then all instances of the header field values MUST be\n   removed before forwarding\
    \ the request to an entity that is not\n   trusted.\n"
- title: 8. User Agent Server Behavior
  contents:
  - "8. User Agent Server Behavior\n   Typically, a user agent renders the value of\
    \ a P-Asserted-Identity\n   header field that it receives to its user.  It may\
    \ consider the\n   identity provided by a Trust Domain to be privileged, or\n\
    \   intrinsically more trustworthy than the From header field of a\n   request.\
    \  However, any specific behavior is specific to\n   implementations or services.\
    \  This document also does not mandate any\n   user agent handling for multiple\
    \ P-Asserted-Identity header field\n   values that happen to appear in a message\
    \ (such as a SIP URI\n   alongside a tel URL).\n   However, if a User Agent Server\
    \ receives a message from a previous\n   element that it does not trust, it MUST\
    \ NOT use the P-Asserted-\n   Identity header field in any way.\n   If a UA is\
    \ part of the Trust Domain from which it received a message\n   containing a P-Asserted-Identity\
    \ header field, then it can use the\n   value freely but it MUST ensure that it\
    \ does not forward the\n   information to any element that is not part of the\
    \ Trust Domain, if\n   the user has requested that asserted identity information\
    \ be kept\n   private.\n   If a UA is not part of the Trust Domain from which\
    \ it received a\n   message containing a P-Asserted-Identity header field, then\
    \ it can\n   assume this information does not need to be kept private.\n"

- title: 11. Example of Spec(T)
  contents:
  - "11. Example of Spec(T)\n   The integrity of the mechanism described in this document\
    \ relies on\n   one node knowing (through configuration) that all of the nodes\
    \ in a\n   Trust Domain will behave in a predetermined way.  This requires the\n\
    \   predetermined behavior to be clearly defined and for all nodes in the\n  \
    \ Trust Domain to be compliant.  The specification set that all nodes\n   in a\
    \ Trust Domain T must comply with is termed 'Spec(T)'.\n   The remainder of this\
    \ section presents an example Spec(T), which is\n   not normative in any way.\n\
    \      1. Protocol requirements\n         The following specifications MUST be\
    \ supported:\n         1. RFC 3261\n         2. RFC 3325\n      2. Authentication\
    \ requirements\n         Users MUST be authenticated using SIP Digest Authentication.\n\
    \      3. Security requirements\n         Connections between nodes within the\
    \ Trust Domain and between\n         UAs and nodes in the Trust Domain MUST use\
    \ TLS using a cipher\n         suite of RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA1.  Mutual authentication\n\
    \         between nodes in the trust domain MUST be performed and\n         confidentiality\
    \ MUST be negotiated.\n      4. Scope of Trust Domain\n         The Trust Domain\
    \ specified in this agreement consists of hosts\n         which posses a valid\
    \ certificate which is a) signed by\n         examplerootca.org; b) whose subjectAltName\
    \ ends with one of the\n         following domain names:  trusted.div1.carrier-a.net,\n\
    \         trusted.div2.carrier-a.net, sip.carrier-b.com; and c) whose\n      \
    \   domain name corresponds to the hostname in the subjectAltName\n         in\
    \ the certificate.\n      5. Implicit handling when no Privacy header is present\n\
    \         The elements in the trust domain must support the 'id' privacy\n   \
    \      service therefore absence of a Privacy header can be assumed to\n     \
    \    indicate that the user is not requesting any privacy.  If no\n         Privacy\
    \ header field is present in a request, elements in this\n         Trust Domain\
    \ MUST act as if no privacy is requested.\n"
- title: 12. Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "12. Security Considerations\n   The mechanism provided in this document is a\
    \ partial consideration of\n   the problem of identity and privacy in SIP.  For\
    \ example, these\n   mechanisms provide no means by which end users can securely\
    \ share\n   identity information end-to-end without a trusted service provider.\n\
    \   Identity information that the user designates as 'private' can be\n   inspected\
    \ by any intermediaries participating in the Trust Domain.\n   This information\
    \ is secured by transitive trust, which is only as\n   reliable as the weakest\
    \ link in the chain of trust.\n   When a trusted entity sends a message to any\
    \ destination with that\n   party's identity in a P-Asserted-Identity header field,\
    \ the entity\n   MUST take precautions to protect the identity information from\n\
    \   eavesdropping and interception to protect the confidentiality and\n   integrity\
    \ of that identity information.  The use of transport or\n   network layer hop-by-hop\
    \ security mechanisms, such as TLS or IPSec\n   with appropriate cipher suites,\
    \ can satisfy this requirement.\n"
