  - "1.  Introduction\n   In existing telecommunications systems, there are many well-known\n
    \  communication and information services that are offered by loosely\n   coordinated
    entities across a large geographic region, with well-\n   known identifiers.  Some
    of the services are operated by governments\n   or regulated monopolies, others
    by competing commercial enterprises.\n   Examples include emergency services (reached
    by dialing 9-1-1 in\n   North America, 1-1-2 in Europe), community services and
    volunteer\n   opportunities (2-1-1 in some regions of the United States), telephone\n
    \  directory and repair services (4-1-1 and 6-1-1 in the United States\n   and
    Canada), government information services (3-1-1 in some cities in\n   the United
    States), lawyer referral services (1-800-LAWYER), car\n   roadside assistance
    (automobile clubs), and pizza delivery services.\n   Unfortunately, almost all
    of them are limited in scope to a single\n   country or possibly a group of countries,
    such as those belonging to\n   the North American Numbering Plan or the European
    Union.  The same\n   identifiers are often used for other purposes outside that
    region,\n   making access to such services difficult when users travel or use\n
    \  devices produced outside their home country.\n   These services are characterized
    by long-term stability of user-\n   visible identifiers, decentralized administration
    of the underlying\n   service, and a well-defined resolution or mapping mechanism.
    \ For\n   example, there is no national coordination or call center for \"9-1-1\"\n
    \  in the United States; rather, various local government organizations\n   cooperate
    to provide this service based on jurisdictions.\n   In this document, we propose
    a URN namespace that, together with\n   resolution protocols beyond the scope
    of this document, allows us to\n   define such global, well-known services, while
    distributing the\n   actual implementation across a large number of service-providing\n
    \  entities.  There are many ways to divide provision of such services,\n   such
    as dividing responsibility by geographic region or by the\n   service provider
    a user chooses.  In addition, users can choose\n   different mapping service providers
    that in turn manage how\n   geographic locations are mapped to service providers.\n
    \  Availability of such service identifiers allows end systems to convey\n   information
    about the desired service to other network entities.  For\n   example, an IP phone
    could have a special set of short cuts, address\n   book entries, or buttons that
    invoke emergency services.  When such a\n   service identifier is put into the
    outgoing Session Initiation\n   Protocol (SIP) [RFC3261] message, it allows SIP
    proxies to\n   unambiguously take actions, as it would not be practical to configure\n
    \  them with dial strings and emergency numbers used throughout the\n   world.
    \ Hence, such service identifiers make it possible to delegate\n   routing decisions
    to third parties and to mark certain requests as\n   having special characteristics
    while preventing these characteristics\n   from being accidentally invoked.\n
    \  This URN identifies services independent of the particular protocol\n   that
    is used to request or deliver the service.  The URN may appear\n   in protocols
    that allow general URIs, such as the SIP [RFC3261]\n   request URIs, web pages,
    or mapping protocols.\n   The service URN is a protocol element and is generally
    not expected\n   to be visible to humans.  For example, it is expected that callers\n
    \  will still dial the emergency number '9-1-1' in the United States to\n   reach
    emergency services.  In some other cases, speed dial buttons\n   might identify
    the service, as is common practice on hotel phones\n   today.  (Speed dial buttons
    for summoning emergency help are\n   considered inappropriate by most emergency
    services professionals, at\n   least for mobile devices, as they are too prone
    to being triggered\n   accidentally.)\n   The translation of service dial strings
    or service numbers to service\n   URNs in the end host is beyond the scope of
    this document.  These\n   translations likely depend on the location of the caller
    and may be\n   many-to-one, i.e., several service numbers may map to one service\n
    \  URN.  For example, a phone for a traveler could recognize the\n   emergency
    service number for both the traveler's home location and\n   the traveler's visited
    location, mapping both to the same universal\n   service URN, urn:service:sos.\n
    \  Since service URNs are not routable, a SIP proxy or user agent has to\n   translate
    the service URN into a routable URI for a location-\n   appropriate service provider,
    such as a SIP URL.  A Location-to-\n   Service Translation Protocol (LoST) [LOST]
    is expected to be used as\n   a resolution system for mapping service URNs to
    URLs based on\n   geographic location.  In the future, there may be several such\n
    \  protocols, possibly different ones for different services.\n   Services are
    described by top-level service type, and may contain a\n   hierarchy of sub-services
    that further describe the service, as\n   outlined in Section 3.\n   We discuss
    alternative approaches for creating service identifiers,\n   and why they are
    unsatisfactory, in Appendix A.\n"

  - "3.  Registration Template\n   Below, we include the registration template for
    the URN scheme\n   according to RFC 3406 [RFC3406].\n   Namespace ID:  service\n
    \  Registration Information:\n      Registration version:  1\n      Registration
    date:  2006-04-02\n   Declared registrant of the namespace:\n      Registering
    organization:  IETF\n      Designated contact:  Henning Schulzrinne\n      Designated
    contact email:  hgs@cs.columbia.edu\n   Declaration of syntactic structure:  The
    URN consists of a\n      hierarchical service identifier, with a sequence of labels\n
    \     separated by periods.  The left-most label is the most significant\n      one
    and is called 'top-level service', while names to the right\n      are called
    'sub-services'.  The set of allowable characters is the\n      same as that for
    domain names [RFC1123] and a subset of the labels\n      allowed in [RFC3958].
    \ Labels are case-insensitive, but MUST be\n      specified in all lower-case.
    \ For any given service URN, service-\n      identifiers can be removed right-to-left;
    the resulting URN is\n      still valid, referring to a more generic service.
    \ In other words,\n      if a service 'x.y.z' exists, the URNs 'x' and 'x.y' are
    also valid\n      service URNs.  The ABNF [RFC4234] is shown below.\n     service-URN
    \ = \"URN:service:\" service\n     service      = top-level *(\".\" sub-service)\n
    \    top-level    = let-dig [ *25let-dig-hyp let-dig ]\n     sub-service  = let-dig
    [ *let-dig-hyp let-dig ]\n     let-dig-hyp  = let-dig / \"-\"\n     let-dig      =
    ALPHA / DIGIT\n     ALPHA        = %x41-5A / %x61-7A   ; A-Z / a-z\n     DIGIT
    \       = %x30-39 ; 0-9\n   Relevant ancillary documentation:  None\n   Community
    considerations:  The service URN is believed to be relevant\n      to a large
    cross-section of Internet users, including both\n      technical and non-technical
    users, on a variety of devices, but\n      particularly for mobile and nomadic
    users.  The service URN will\n      allow Internet users needing services to identify
    the service by\n      kind, without having to determine manually who provides
    the\n      particular service in the user's current context, e.g., at the\n      user's
    current location.  For example, travelers will be able to\n      use their mobile
    devices to request emergency services without\n      having to know the emergency
    dial string of the visited country.\n      The assignment of identifiers is described
    in the IANA\n      Considerations (Section 4).  The service URN does not prescribe
    a\n      particular resolution mechanism, but it is assumed that a number\n      of
    different entities could operate and offer such mechanisms.\n   Namespace considerations:
    \ There do not appear to be other URN\n      namespaces that serve the same need
    of uniquely identifying\n      widely-available communication and information
    services.  Unlike\n      most other currently registered URN namespaces, the service
    URN\n      does not identify documents and protocol objects (e.g., [RFC3044],\n
    \     [RFC3187], [RFC4179], and [RFC4195]), types of telecommunications\n      equipment
    [RFC4152], people, or organizations [RFC3043].  tel URIs\n      [RFC3966] identify
    telephone numbers, but numbers commonly\n      identifying services (such as 911
    or 112) are specific to a\n      particular region or country.\n   Identifier
    uniqueness considerations:  A service URN identifies a\n      logical service,
    specified in the service registration (see IANA\n      Considerations (Section
    4)).  Resolution of the URN, if\n      successful, will return a particular instance
    of the service, and\n      this instance may be different even for two users making
    the same\n      request in the same place at the same time; the logical service\n
    \     identified by the URN, however, is persistent and unique.  Service\n      URNs
    MUST be unique for each unique service; this is guaranteed\n      through the
    registration of each service within this namespace,\n      described in Section
    4.\n   Identifier persistence considerations:  The 'service' URN for the\n      same
    service is expected to be persistent, although there\n      naturally cannot be
    a guarantee that a particular service will\n      continue to be available globally
    or at all times.\n   Process of identifier assignment:  The process of identifier\n
    \     assignment is described in the IANA Considerations (Section 4).\n   Process
    for identifier resolution:  There is no single global\n      resolution service
    for 'service' URNs.  However, each top-level\n      service can provide a set
    of mapping protocols to be used with\n      'service' URNs of that service.\n
    \  Rules for lexical equivalence:  'service' identifiers are compared\n      according
    to case-insensitive string equality.\n   Conformance with URN syntax:  The BNF
    in the 'Declaration of\n      syntactic structure' above constrains the syntax
    for this URN\n      scheme.\n   Validation mechanism:  Validation determines whether
    a given string\n      is currently a validly-assigned URN [RFC3406].  Due to the\n
    \     distributed nature of the mapping mechanism, and since not all\n      services
    are available everywhere and not all mapping servers may\n      be configured
    with all current service registrations, validation\n      in this sense is not
    possible.  Also, the discovery mechanism for\n      the mapping mechanism may
    not be configured with all current top-\n      level services.\n   Scope:  The
    scope for this URN is public and global.\n"

      requires\n   IANA action.  The policy for adding top-level service labels is\n
      \  'Standards Action'.  (This document defines the top-level services\n   'sos'
      and 'counseling'.)  The policy for assigning labels to sub-\n   services may
      differ for each top-level service designation and MUST\n   be defined by the

      service registration within the IANA\n   registry defined in Section 4.1, using
      the top-level service label\n   'sos'.\n   The 'sos' service type describes
      emergency services requiring an\n   immediate response, typically offered by
      various branches of the\n   government or other public institutions.  Additional
      sub-services can\n   be added after expert review and must be of general public
      interest\n   and have a similar emergency nature.  The expert is designated
      by the\n   ECRIT working group, its successor, or, in their absence, the IESG.\n
      \  The expert review should only approve emergency services that are\n   offered
      widely and in different countries, with approximately the\n   same caller expectation

      general government, public\n   information, counseling, or social services.\n
      \  urn:service:sos  The generic 'sos' service reaches a public safety\n      answering

  - "Appendix A.  Alternative Approaches Considered\n   The discussions of ways to
    identify emergency calls has yielded a\n   number of proposals.  Since these are
    occasionally brought up during\n   discussions, we briefly summarize why this
    document chose not to\n   pursue these solutions.\n   tel:NNN;context=+C  This
    approach uses tel URIs [RFC3966].  Here, NNN\n      is the national emergency
    number, where the country is identified\n      by the context C.  This approach
    is easy for user agents to\n      implement, but hard for proxies and other SIP
    elements to\n      recognize, as it would have to know about all number-context\n
    \     combinations in the world and track occasional changes.  In\n      addition,
    many of these numbers are being used for other services.\n      For example, the
    emergency number in Paraguay (00) is also used to\n      call the international
    operator in the United States.  As another\n      example, a number of countries,
    such as Italy, use 118 as an\n      emergency number, but it also connects to
    directory assistance in\n      Finland.\n   tel:sos  This solution avoids name
    conflicts, but requires extending\n      the \"tel\" URI \"tel\" [RFC3966].  It
    also only works if every\n      outbound proxy knows how to route requests to
    a proxy that can\n      reach emergency services since tel URIs do not identify
    the\n      destination server.\n   sip:sos@domain  Earlier work had defined a
    special user identifier,\n      sos, within the caller's home domain in a SIP
    URI, for example,\n      sip:sos@example.com.  Such a user identifier follows
    the\n      convention of RFC 2142 [RFC2142] and the \"postmaster\" convention\n
    \     documented in RFC 2822 [RFC2822].  This approach had the advantage\n      that
    dial plans in existing user agents could probably be\n      converted to generate
    such a URI and that only the home proxy for\n      the domain has to understand
    the user naming convention.  However,\n      it overloads the user part of the
    URI with specific semantics\n      rather than being opaque, makes routing by
    the outbound proxy a\n      special case that does not conform to normal SIP request-URI\n
    \     handling rules and is SIP-specific.  The mechanism also does not\n      extend
    readily to other services.\n   SIP URI user parameter:  One could create a special
    URI, such as\n      \"aor-domain;user=sos\".  This avoids the name conflict problem,
    but\n      requires mechanism-aware user agents that are capable of emitting\n
    \     this special URI.  Also, the 'user' parameter is meant to describe\n      the
    format of the user part of the SIP URI, which this usage does\n      not do.  Adding
    other parameters still leaves unclear what, if\n      any, conventions should
    be used for the user and domain part of\n      the URL.  Neither solution is likely
    to be backward-compatible\n      with existing clients.\n   Special domain:  A
    special domain, such as \"sip:fire@sos.int\" could\n      be used to identify
    emergency calls.  This has similar properties\n      as the \"tel:sos\" URI, except
    that it is indeed a valid URI.  To\n      make this usable, the special domain
    would have to be operational\n      and point to an appropriate emergency services
    proxy.  Having a\n      single, if logical, emergency services proxy for the whole
    world\n      seems to have undesirable scaling and administrative properties.\n"
