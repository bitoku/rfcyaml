- title: 8.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "8.  Security Considerations\n   There are a number of management objects defined\
    \ in this MIB module\n   with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.\
    \  Such\n   objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network\n\
    \   environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure\n   environment\
    \ without proper protection can have a negative effect on\n   network operations.\
    \  These are the tables and objects and their\n   sensitivity/vulnerability:\n\
    \   Writable objects that could be misused to cause network delays and\n   spanning\
    \ tree instabilities include dot1dStpVersion,\n   dot1dStpTxHoldCount, dot1dStpPortProtocolMigration,\n\
    \   dot1dStpPortAdminEdgePort, and dot1dStpPortAdminPathCost.\n   Some of the\
    \ readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a\n   MAX-ACCESS other\
    \ than not-accessible) may be considered sensitive or\n   vulnerable in some network\
    \ environments.  It is thus important to\n   control even GET and/or NOTIFY access\
    \ to these objects and possibly\n   to even encrypt the values of these objects\
    \ when sending them over\n   the network via SNMP.  These are the tables and objects\
    \ and their\n   sensitivity/vulnerability:\n   dot1dStpVersion could be read by\
    \ an attacker to identify environments\n   containing applications or protocols\
    \ that are potentially sensitive\n   to RSTP mode.\n   dot1dStpPortAdminPointToPoint\
    \ could be used to mislead an access\n   control protocol, such as 802.1x, to\
    \ believe that only one other\n   system is attached to a LAN segment and to enable\
    \ network access\n   based on that assumption.  This situation could permit potential\n\
    \   man-in-the-middle attacks.\n   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include\
    \ adequate security.\n   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by\
    \ using IPsec),\n   even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network\
    \ is\n   allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects\n\
    \   in this MIB module.\n   It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security\
    \ features as\n   provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8),\n\
    \   including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for\n   authentication\
    \ and privacy).\n   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT\n\
    \   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to\n   enable\
    \ cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator\n   responsibility to\
    \ ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an\n   instance of this MIB module\
    \ is properly configured to give access to\n   the objects only to those principals\
    \ (users) that have legitimate\n   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete)\
    \ them.\n"
