Abstract RFC 5869 specifies the HMAC based Extract and
Expand Key Derivation Function (HKDF) algorithm.
This document assigns algorithm identifiers to the HKDF algorithm when used with three common one way hash functions.
The HKDF algorithm [RFC5869] is a key derivation function based on the Hashed Message Authentication Code (HMAC).
This document assigns algorithm identifiers to the HKDF algorithm when used with three common one way hash functions.
These algorithm identifiers are needed to make use of the HKDF in some security protocols, such as the Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) [RFC5652].
The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14
when, and only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here.
In this specification, values are generated using ASN.1 [X.680] using the Basic Encoding Rules (BER) and the Distinguished Encoding Rules (DER)
This section assigns three algorithm identifiers to HKDF [RFC5869] used with three common one way hash functions that are specified in [SHS]: SHA 256, SHA 384, and SHA 512.
When any of these three object identifiers appear within the ASN.1 type AlgorithmIdentifier, the parameters component of that type SHALL be absent.
The specification of AlgorithmIdentifier is available in [RFC5911], which evolved from the original definition in X.509 [X.509 88].

29 } id alg hkdf with sha512 OBJECT
This section contains the ASN.1 module for the HKDF algorithm identifiers.
This module imports types from other ASN.1 modules that are defined in [RFC5912].
{ iso(1) member body(2) us(840)
} DEFINITIONS IMPLICIT TAGS ::

} } kda hkdf with sha384 KEY DERIVATION ::
{ IDENTIFIER id alg hkdf with sha384 PARAMS
ARE absent SMIME CAPS { IDENTIFIED BY id alg hkdf with sha512 }
Despite the simplicity of HKDF, there are many security considerations that have been taken into account in the design and analysis of this construction.
An exposition of all of these aspects is well beyond the scope of this document.
Please refer to [EPRINT] for detailed information, including rationale for the HKDF design.
One object identifier for the ASN.1 module in Section 3 was assigned in the "SMI Security for S/MIME Module Identifiers (1.2.840.113549.1.9.16.0)
} Three object identifiers for the HKDF algorithm identifiers were assigned in the "SMI Security for S/MIME Algorithms (1.2.840.113549.1.9.16.3)" registry [IANA ALG]: id alg hkdf with sha256 OBJECT
28 } id alg hkdf with sha384 OBJECT
29 } id alg hkdf with sha512 OBJECT
