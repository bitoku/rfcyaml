- title: 2.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "2.  Introduction\n   This report describes how RIPng may be useful within the\
    \ new IPv6\n   Internet.  In essence, the environments in which RIPng is the IGP\
    \ of\n   choice is comparable to the environments in which RIP-2 (RFC 1723) is\n\
    \   used in the IPv4 Internet.  It is important to remember that RIPng is\n  \
    \ a simple extrapolation of RIP-2; RIPng has nothing conceptually new.\n   Thus,\
    \ the operational aspects of distance-vector routing protocols,\n   and RIP-2\
    \ in particular, within an autonomous system are well\n   understood.\n   It should\
    \ be noted that RIPng is not intended to be a substitute for\n   OSPFng in large\
    \ autonomous systems; the restrictions on AS diameter\n   and complexity which\
    \ applied to RIP-2 also apply to RIPng.  Rather,\n   RIPng allows the smaller,\
    \ simpler, distance-vector protocol to be\n   used in environments which require\
    \ authentication or the use of\n   variable length subnet masks, but are not of\
    \ a size or complexity\n   which require the use of the larger, more complex,\
    \ link-state\n   protocol.\n   The remainder of this report describes how each\
    \ of the features of\n   RIPng is useful within IPv6.\n"
- title: 3.  Applicability
  contents:
  - "3.  Applicability\n   A goal in developing RIPng was to make the minimum necessary\
    \ change\n   to RIP-2 to produce RIPng.  In essence, the IPv4 address was expanded\n\
    \   into an IPv6 address, the IPv4 subnet mask was replaced with an IPv6\n   prefix\
    \ length, the next-hop field was eliminated but the\n   functionality has been\
    \ preserved, and authentication was removed.\n   The route tag field has been\
    \ preserved.  The maximum diameter of the\n   network (the maximum metric value)\
    \ is 15; 16 still means infinity\n   (unreachable).\n   The basic RIP header is\
    \ unchanged.  However, the size of a routing\n   packet is no longer arbitrarily\
    \ limited.  Because routing updates are\n   never forwarded, the routing packet\
    \ size is now determined by the\n   physical media and the sizes of the headers\
    \ which precede the routing\n   data (i.e., media MTU minus the combined header\
    \ lengths).  The number\n   routes which may be included in a routing update is\
    \ the routing data\n   length divided by the size of a routing entry.\n"
- title: 3.1 Prefix
  contents:
  - "3.1 Prefix\n   The address field of a routing entry is 128 bits in length, expanded\n\
    \   from the 32 bits available in RIP-2.  This allows the RIP entry to\n   carry\
    \ an IPv6 prefix.\n"
- title: 3.2 Prefix Length
  contents:
  - "3.2 Prefix Length\n   The 32-bit RIP-2 subnet mask field is replaced by an 8-bit\
    \ prefix\n   length field.  It allows the specification of the number of bits\
    \ in\n   the prefix which form the actual prefix.\n"
- title: 3.3 Next Hop
  contents:
  - "3.3 Next Hop\n   The ability to specify the next hop, rather than simply allowing\
    \ the\n   recipient of the update to set the next hop to the sender of the\n \
    \  update, allows for the elimination of unnecessary hops through\n   routers\
    \ which are running multiple routing protocols.  Consider\n   following example\
    \ topology:\n         -----   -----         -----   -----\n         |IR1|   |IR2|\
    \         |XR1|   |XR2|\n         --+--   --+--         --+--   --+--\n      \
    \     |       |             |       |\n         --+-------+-------------+-------+--\n\
    \           |--------RIPng--------|\n   The Internal Routers (IR1 and IR2) are\
    \ only running RIPng.  The\n   External Routers (XR1 and XR2) are both running\
    \ BGP, for example;\n   however, only XR1 is running BGP and RIPng.  Since XR2\
    \ is not running\n   RIPng, the IRs will not know of its existance and will never\
    \ use it\n   as a next hop, even if it is a better next hop than XR1.  Of course,\n\
    \   XR1 knows this and can indicate, via the Next Hop mechanism, that XR2\n  \
    \ is the better next hop for some routes.\n"
- title: 3.4 Authentication
  contents:
  - "3.4 Authentication\n   Authentication, which was added to RIP-2 because RIP-1\
    \ did not have\n   it, has been dropped from RIPng.  This is safe to do because\
    \ IPv6,\n   which carries the RIPng packets, has build in security which IPv4\
    \ did\n   not have.\n"
- title: 3.5 Packet Length
  contents:
  - "3.5 Packet Length\n   By allowing RIPng routing update packets to be as big as\
    \ possible,\n   the number of packets which must be sent for a complete update\
    \ is\n   greatly reduced.  This in no way affects the operation of the\n   distance-vector\
    \ protocol; it is merely a performance enhancement.\n"
- title: 3.6 Diameter and Complexity
  contents:
  - "3.6 Diameter and Complexity\n   The limit of 15 cost-1 hops is a function of\
    \ the distance-vector\n   protocol, which depends on counting to infinity to resolve\
    \ some\n   routing loops.  If infinity is too high, the time it would take to\n\
    \   resolve, not to mention the number of routing updates which would be\n   sent,\
    \ would be prohibitive.  If the infinity is too small, the\n   protocol becomes\
    \ useless in a reasonably sized network.  The choice\n   of 16 for infinity was\
    \ made in the earliest of RIP implementations\n   and experience has shown it\
    \ to be a good compromise value.\n   RIPng will efficiently support networks of\
    \ moderate complexity.  That\n   is, topologies without too many multi-hop loops.\
    \  RIPng also\n   effeciently supports topologies which change frequently because\n\
    \   routing table changes are made incrementally and do not require the\n   computation\
    \ which link-state protocols require to rebuild their maps.\n"
- title: 4.  Conclusion
  contents:
  - "4.  Conclusion\n   Because the basic protocol is unchanged, RIPng is as correct\
    \ a\n   routing protocol as RIP-2.  RIPng serves the same niche for IPv6 as\n\
    \   RIP-2 does for IPv4.\n"
