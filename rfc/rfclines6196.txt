Abstract This document registers the mailserver: URI scheme as historic in the IANA URI registry.
1.  Introduction and Overview RFC 1738
registers the mailserver: URI scheme as provisional in the IANA URI registry defined by [RFC4395], defining it as "Access to data available from mail servers" with no further details provided.
The author of this document is not aware of any other more detailed definition of the mailserver: URI scheme.
The mailserver: URI scheme as currently specified is not interoperable.
There is a small risk that somebody would decide to implement this scheme by looking at IANA's URI scheme registry, possibly inventing some undocumented syntax for it.
In order to minimize such risk, this document discourages any future implementations of this URI scheme and asks IANA to mark it as Historic in the URI scheme registry.
There were some previous attempts to provide detailed documentation of the mailserver: URI scheme, but those efforts were not successful.
Implementors interested in providing instructions for generating an email [RFC5322] message can instead use the mailto: URI scheme [RFC6068].
Implementors interested in referencing a message or a set of messages available from a mailstore over IMAP [RFC3501]
, POP [RFC1939], or web [RFC2616] can instead use the imap:
[RFC5092], pop: [RFC2384] or http: [
In the past, the mailserver: URI scheme was never properly documented and thus doesn't interoperate.
There are no known implementations of this URI scheme.
IANA Considerations IANA has re registered the mailserver: URI scheme as Historic in the URI scheme registry and updated the reference to point to this document.
