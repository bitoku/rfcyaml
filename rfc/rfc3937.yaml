  - "1.  Introduction\n   The International Press Telecommunications Council (IPTC)\
    \ is a non-\n   profit consortium of the world's major news agencies and news\n\
    \   industry vendors.  It develops and maintains technical standards for\n   the\
    \ news business that are used by virtually every major news\n   organization in\
    \ the world.  IPTC was established in 1965.\n   Since the 1990's IPTC's standardization\
    \ work is based on open\n   standards like first SGML, then the XML [W3CXML] family\
    \ of standards,\n   MIME, Unicode, and so on.\n   As some of these standards require\
    \ identification of resources IPTC\n   was looking for a technology for globally\
    \ unique, persistent and\n   location-independent identifiers and decided to implement\
    \ URNs as\n   described in \"URN Syntax\" [RFC2141] for this reason.\n   This\
    \ namespace specification is for a formal namespace.\n"

  contents:
  - "2.3.  Declaration of syntactic structure\n   All URNs assigned by IPTC will have\
    \ a Namespace Specific String (NSS)\n   of the following hierarchical structure:\n\
    \   At the top of the hierarchy are three branches:\n   - \"std\"\n   - \"std-draft\"\
    \n   - \"workdoc\"\n   The \"std\" branch hierarchy:\n      The \"std\" branch\
    \ URNs will be assigned to IPTC resources\n      used for specifying and explaining\
    \ any aspect of an IPTC\n      standard.\n      The NSS in the \"std\" branch\
    \ will have this general structure:\n      urn:iptc:std:{std-name}:{std-version}:{res-group}\n\
    \          {:res-name}?{:res-version}?\n      where\n      \"std-name\" is a unique\
    \ identifier for an IPTC standard.\n      \"std-version\" reflects the version\
    \ of this standard.  The value\n          'current' will be assigned to point\
    \ at resources of the\n          current version of a standard.\n      \"res-group\"\
    : this field will take only three values:\n         \"spec\" for all resources\
    \ specifying a standard,\n         \"doc\" for all resources used for additional\
    \ documentation of\n             and to support the use of a standard.\n     \
    \    \"xmlns\" for defining an XML namespace [W3CXMLNS].\n      \"res-name\" is\
    \ an identifier for a tangible resource; the name\n      should describe the content\
    \ or the use of the resource.  Since not\n      all resources are tangible this\
    \ value is optional.\n      \"res-version\" reflects the version of this resource\
    \ as long as it\n      takes a physical format - like e.g., a file.  Since not\
    \ all\n      resources are of a physical kind this value is optional.\n   The\
    \ \"std-draft\" branch hierarchy:\n      The \"std-draft\" branch URNs will be\
    \ assigned to IPTC resources\n      used for specifying and explaining any aspect\
    \ of an IPTC standard\n      while being in draft status, that is at a time when\
    \ the resource\n      is not formally approved by the IPTC Standards body.\n \
    \     The NSS in the \"std\" branch will have this general structure:\n      urn:iptc:std-draft:{std-name}:{std-version}:{res-group}\n\
    \          {:res-name}?{:res-version}?\n      The substructure of \"urn:iptc:std-draft\"\
    \ is identical to that of\n      \"urn:iptc:std\", find all explanations there.\n\
    \   The \"workdoc\" branch hierarchy:\n      The \"workdoc\" branch URNs will\
    \ be assigned to IPTC resources not\n      directly related to IPTC standards\
    \ but to the work of IPTC.\n      The NSS in the \"doc\" branch will have this\
    \ general structure:\n      urn:iptc:workdoc:{group-id}:{doc-id}:{doc-version}{:doc-descr}?\n\
    \      where\n      \"group-id\" is a unique identifier for working groups and\
    \ working\n         areas of IPTC and constitutes a document group.\n      \"\
    doc-id\" is a unique identifier for a document within a document\n          group.\n\
    \      \"doc-version\" reflects the version of this work document.\n      \"doc-descr\"\
    \ is an optional concise description of the document\n          content.\n"

- title: 4.  Namespace Considerations and Community Considerations
  contents:
  - "4.  Namespace Considerations and Community Considerations\n   The IPTC acknowledged\
    \ already the use of URNs during the development\n   of its XML based standard\
    \ \"NewsML\".  This standard implements the use\n   of URNs as unique identifiers\
    \ for news items as described in \"URN\n   Namespace for NewsML resources\" [RFC3085].\n\
    \   While developing additional XML based standards as siblings to\n   NewsML,\
    \ IPTC soon got aware that URNs have to be assigned to\n   resources that fall\
    \ beyond the scope of the NewsML namespace.  For\n   this reason IPTC developed\
    \ a new and very general hierarchical\n   namespace structure to cover the needs\
    \ of the currently developed\n   standards as well as future standards and to\
    \ be able to assign URNs\n   to resources emanating from them.\n   In addition\
    \ to resources relating directly to its standards, IPTC\n   also produces and\
    \ publishes other documents relevant to the news\n   business.  As those resources\
    \ are used by many organizations outside\n   the IPTC membership and therefore\
    \ could not be considered as internal\n   documents IPTC decided to add a branch\
    \ to the URN hierarchy to be\n   assigned to these resources.\n   IPTC maintains\
    \ global activities and its standards as well as\n   resources based on them are\
    \ used world wide.  Since one focus of the\n   activities of IPTC is on global\
    \ exchange of news any system for\n   unique identification of resources has to\
    \ be considered under global\n   aspects.\n   For this reason IPTC considers the\
    \ introduction of a URN namespace\n   for its resources as proper action to maintain\
    \ globally unique,\n   persistent and location-independent identifiers based on\
    \ open\n   standards.\n"
