  - "1.  Introduction\n   RPKI-based origin validation relies on widespread deployment\
    \ of the\n   Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) [RFC6480].  How the RPKI\
    \ is\n   distributed and maintained globally is a serious concern from many\n\
    \   aspects.\n   While the global RPKI is in the early stages of deployment, there\
    \ is\n   no single root trust anchor, initial testing is being done by the\n \
    \  Regional Internet Registries (RIRs), and there are technical\n   testbeds.\
    \  It is thought that origin validation based on the RPKI\n   will continue to\
    \ be deployed incrementally over the next few years.\n   It is assumed that eventually\
    \ there must be a single root trust\n   anchor for the public address space, see\
    \ [IAB].\n   Origin validation needs to be done only by an AS's border routers\
    \ and\n   is designed so that it can be used to protect announcements that are\n\
    \   originated by any network participating in Internet BGP routing:\n   large\
    \ providers, upstream and downstream routers, and by edge\n   networks (e.g.,\
    \ small stub or enterprise networks).\n   Origin validation has been designed\
    \ to be deployed on current routers\n   without significant hardware upgrades.\
    \  It should be used in border\n   routers by operators from large backbones to\
    \ small stub/enterprise/\n   edge networks.\n   RPKI-based origin validation has\
    \ been designed so that, with prudent\n   local routing policies, there is little\
    \ risk that what is seen as\n   today's normal Internet routing is threatened\
    \ by imprudent deployment\n   of the global RPKI; see Section 5.\n"

- title: 3.  RPKI Distribution and Maintenance
  contents:
  - "3.  RPKI Distribution and Maintenance\n   The RPKI is a distributed database\
    \ containing certificates,\n   Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs), manifests,\
    \ ROAs, and\n   Ghostbusters Records as described in [RFC6481].  Policies and\n\
    \   considerations for RPKI object generation and maintenance are\n   discussed\
    \ elsewhere.\n   The RPKI repository design [RFC6481] anticipated a hierarchic\n\
    \   organization of repositories, as this seriously improves the\n   performance\
    \ of relying parties that gather data over a non-hierarchic\n   organization.\
    \  Publishing parties MUST implement hierarchic directory\n   structures.\n  \
    \ A local relying party's valid cache containing all RPKI data may be\n   gathered\
    \ from the global distributed database using the rsync\n   protocol [RFC5781]\
    \ and a validation tool such as rcynic [rcynic].\n   A validated cache contains\
    \ all RPKI objects that the RP has verified\n   to be valid according to the rules\
    \ for validation RPKI certificates\n   and signed objects; see [RFC6487] and [RFC6488].\
    \  Entities that trust\n   the cache can use these RPKI objects without further\
    \ validation.\n   Validated caches may also be created and maintained from other\n\
    \   validated caches.  Network operators SHOULD take maximum advantage of\n  \
    \ this feature to minimize load on the global distributed RPKI\n   database. \
    \ Of course, the recipient relying parties should\n   re-validate the data.\n\
    \   As Trust Anchor Locators (TALs) [RFC6490] are critical to the RPKI\n   trust\
    \ model, operators should be very careful in their initial\n   selection and vigilant\
    \ in their maintenance.\n   Timing of inter-cache synchronization, and synchronization\
    \ between\n   caches and the global RPKI, is outside the scope of this document,\n\
    \   and depends on things such as how often routers feed from the caches,\n  \
    \ how often the operator feels the global RPKI changes significantly,\n   etc.\n\
    \   As inter-cache synchronization within an operator's network does not\n   impact\
    \ global RPKI resources, an operator may choose to synchronize\n   quite frequently.\n\
    \   To relieve routers of the load of performing certificate validation,\n   cryptographic\
    \ operations, etc., the RPKI-Router protocol [RFC6810]\n   does not provide object-based\
    \ security to the router.  That is, the\n   router cannot validate the data cryptographically\
    \ from a well-known\n   trust anchor.  The router trusts the cache to provide\
    \ correct data\n   and relies on transport-based security for the data received\
    \ from the\n   cache.  Therefore, the authenticity and integrity of the data from\n\
    \   the cache should be well protected; see Section 7 of [RFC6810].\n   As RPKI-based\
    \ origin validation relies on the availability of RPKI\n   data, operators SHOULD\
    \ locate RPKI caches close to routers that\n   require these data and services\
    \ in order to minimize the impact of\n   likely failures in local routing, intermediate\
    \ devices, long\n   circuits, etc.  One should also consider trust boundaries,\
    \ routing\n   bootstrap reachability, etc.\n   For example, a router should bootstrap\
    \ from a cache that is reachable\n   with minimal reliance on other infrastructure\
    \ such as DNS or routing\n   protocols.  If a router needs its BGP and/or IGP\
    \ to converge for the\n   router to reach a cache, once a cache is reachable,\
    \ the router will\n   then have to reevaluate prefixes already learned via BGP.\
    \  Such\n   configurations should be avoided if reasonably possible.\n   If insecure\
    \ transports are used between an operator's cache and their\n   router(s), the\
    \ Transport Security recommendations in [RFC6810] SHOULD\n   be followed.  In\
    \ particular, operators MUST NOT use insecure\n   transports between their routers\
    \ and RPKI caches located in other\n   Autonomous Systems.\n   For redundancy,\
    \ a router should peer with more than one cache at the\n   same time.  Peering\
    \ with two or more, at least one local and others\n   remote, is recommended.\n\
    \   If an operator trusts upstreams to carry their traffic, they may also\n  \
    \ trust the RPKI data those upstreams cache and SHOULD peer with caches\n   made\
    \ available to them by those upstreams.  Note that this places an\n   obligation\
    \ on those upstreams to maintain fresh and reliable caches\n   and to make them\
    \ available to their customers.  And, as usual, the\n   recipient SHOULD re-validate\
    \ the data.\n   A transit provider or a network with peers SHOULD validate origins\
    \ in\n   announcements made by upstreams, downstreams, and peers.  They still\n\
    \   should trust the caches provided by their upstreams.\n   Before issuing a\
    \ ROA for a super-block, an operator MUST ensure that\n   all sub-allocations\
    \ from that block that are announced by other ASes,\n   e.g., customers, have\
    \ correct ROAs in the RPKI.  Otherwise, issuing a\n   ROA for the super-block\
    \ will cause the announcements of sub-\n   allocations with no ROAs to be viewed\
    \ as Invalid; see [RFC6811].\n   While waiting for all recipients of sub-allocations\
    \ to register ROAs,\n   the owner of the super-block may use live BGP data to\
    \ populate ROAs\n   as a proxy, and then safely issue a ROA for the super-block.\n\
    \   Use of RPKI-based origin validation removes any need to inject more\n   specifics\
    \ into BGP to protect against mis-origination of a less\n   specific prefix. \
    \ Having a ROA for the covering prefix will protect\n   it.\n   To aid translation\
    \ of ROAs into efficient search algorithms in\n   routers, ROAs should be as precise\
    \ as possible, i.e., match prefixes\n   as announced in BGP.  For example, software\
    \ and operators SHOULD\n   avoid use of excessive max length values in ROAs unless\
    \ they are\n   operationally necessary.\n   One advantage of minimal ROA length\
    \ is that the forged origin attack\n   does not work for sub-prefixes that are\
    \ not covered by overly long\n   max length.  For example, if, instead of 10.0.0.0/16-24,\
    \ one issues\n   10.0.0.0/16 and 10.0.42.0/24, a forged origin attack cannot succeed\n\
    \   against 10.0.666.0/24.  They must attack the whole /16, which is more\n  \
    \ likely to be noticed because of its size.\n   Therefore, ROA generation software\
    \ MUST use the prefix length as the\n   max length if the user does not specify\
    \ a max length.\n   Operators should be conservative in use of max length in ROAs.\
    \  For\n   example, if a prefix will have only a few sub-prefixes announced,\n\
    \   multiple ROAs for the specific announcements should be used as\n   opposed\
    \ to one ROA with a long max length.\n   Operators owning prefix P should issue\
    \ ROAs for all ASes that may\n   announce P.  If a prefix is legitimately announced\
    \ by more than one\n   AS, ROAs for all of the ASes SHOULD be issued so that all\
    \ are\n   considered Valid.\n   In an environment where private address space\
    \ is announced in\n   External BGP (eBGP), the operator may have private RPKI\
    \ objects that\n   cover these private spaces.  This will require a trust anchor\
    \ created\n   and owned by that environment; see [LTA-USE].\n   Operators issuing\
    \ ROAs may have customers that announce their own\n   prefixes and ASes into global\
    \ eBGP, but who do not wish to go though\n   the work to manage the relevant certificates\
    \ and ROAs.  Operators\n   SHOULD offer to provision the RPKI data for these customers\
    \ just as\n   they provision many other things for them.\n   An operator using\
    \ RPKI data MAY choose any polling frequency they\n   wish for ensuring they have\
    \ a fresh RPKI cache.  However, if they use\n   RPKI data as an input to operational\
    \ routing decisions, they SHOULD\n   ensure local caches inside their AS are synchronized\
    \ with each other\n   at least every four to six hours.\n   Operators should use\
    \ tools that warn them of any impending ROA or\n   certificate expiry that could\
    \ affect the validity of their own data.\n   Ghostbusters Records [RFC6493] can\
    \ be used to facilitate contact with\n   upstream Certification Authorities (CAs)\
    \ to effect repair.\n"
- title: 4.  Within a Network
  contents:
  - "4.  Within a Network\n   Origin validation need only be done by edge routers\
    \ in a network,\n   those which border other networks or ASes.\n   A validating\
    \ router will use the result of origin validation to\n   influence local policy\
    \ within its network; see Section 5.  In\n   deployment, this policy should fit\
    \ into the AS's existing policy,\n   preferences, etc.  This allows a network\
    \ to incrementally deploy\n   validation-capable border routers.\n   The operator\
    \ should be aware that RPKI-based origin validation, as\n   any other policy change,\
    \ can cause traffic shifts in their network.\n   And, as with normal policy shift\
    \ practice, a prudent operator has\n   tools and methods to predict, measure,\
    \ modify, etc.\n"
- title: 5.  Routing Policy
  contents:
  - "5.  Routing Policy\n   Origin validation based on the RPKI marks a received announcement\
    \ as\n   having an origin that is Valid, NotFound, or Invalid; see [RFC6811].\n\
    \   How this is used in routing should be specified by the operator's\n   local\
    \ policy.\n   Local policy using relative preference is suggested to manage the\n\
    \   uncertainty associated with a system in early deployment; local\n   policy\
    \ can be applied to eliminate the threat of unreachability of\n   prefixes due\
    \ to ill-advised certification policies and/or incorrect\n   certification data.\
    \  For example, until the community feels\n   comfortable relying on RPKI data,\
    \ routing on Invalid origin validity,\n   though at a low preference, MAY occur.\n\
    \   Operators should be aware that accepting Invalid announcements, no\n   matter\
    \ how de-preferenced, will often be the equivalent of treating\n   them as fully\
    \ Valid.  Consider having a ROA for AS 42 for prefix\n   10.0.0.0/16-24.  A BGP\
    \ announcement for 10.0.666.0/24 from AS 666\n   would be Invalid.  But if policy\
    \ is not configured to discard it,\n   then longest-match forwarding will send\
    \ packets toward AS 666, no\n   matter the value of local preference.\n   As origin\
    \ validation will be rolled out incrementally, coverage will\n   be incomplete\
    \ for a long time.  Therefore, routing on NotFound\n   validity state SHOULD be\
    \ done for a long time.  As the transition\n   moves forward, the number of BGP\
    \ announcements with validation state\n   NotFound should decrease.  Hence, an\
    \ operator's policy should not be\n   overly strict and should prefer Valid announcements;\
    \ it should attach\n   a lower preference to, but still use, NotFound announcements,\
    \ and\n   drop or give a very low preference to Invalid announcements.  Merely\n\
    \   de-preferencing Invalid announcements is ill-advised; see previous\n   paragraph.\n\
    \   Some providers may choose to set Local-Preference based on the RPKI\n   validation\
    \ result.  Other providers may not want the RPKI validation\n   result to be more\
    \ important than AS_PATH length -- these providers\n   would need to map the RPKI\
    \ validation result to some BGP attribute\n   that is evaluated in BGP's path\
    \ selection process after the AS_PATH\n   is evaluated.  Routers implementing\
    \ RPKI-based origin validation MUST\n   provide such options to operators.\n \
    \  Local-Preference may be used to carry both the validity state of a\n   prefix\
    \ along with its traffic engineering (TE) characteristic(s).  It\n   is likely\
    \ that an operator already using Local-Preference will have\n   to change policy\
    \ so they can encode these two separate\n   characteristics in the same BGP attribute\
    \ without negative impact or\n   opening privilege escalation attacks.  For example,\
    \ do not encode\n   validation state in higher bits than used for TE.\n   When\
    \ using a metric that is also influenced by other local policy, an\n   operator\
    \ should be careful not to create privilege-upgrade\n   vulnerabilities.  For\
    \ example, if Local Pref is set depending on\n   validity state, peer community\
    \ signaling SHOULD NOT upgrade an\n   Invalid announcement to Valid or better.\n\
    \   Announcements with Valid origins should be preferred over those with\n   NotFound\
    \ or Invalid origins, if Invalid origins are accepted at all.\n   Announcements\
    \ with NotFound origins should be preferred over those\n   with Invalid origins.\n\
    \   Announcements with Invalid origins SHOULD NOT be used, but may be\n   used\
    \ to meet special operational needs.  In such circumstances, the\n   announcement\
    \ should have a lower preference than that given to Valid\n   or NotFound.\n \
    \  When first deploying origin validation, it may be prudent not to drop\n   announcements\
    \ with Invalid origins until inspection of logs, SNMP, or\n   other data indicates\
    \ that the correct result would be obtained.\n   Validity state signaling SHOULD\
    \ NOT be accepted from a neighbor AS.\n   The validity state of a received announcement\
    \ has only local scope\n   due to issues such as scope of trust, RPKI synchrony,\
    \ and management\n   of local trust anchors [LTA-USE].\n"
- title: 6.  Notes and Recommendations
  contents:
  - "6.  Notes and Recommendations\n   Like the DNS, the global RPKI presents only\
    \ a loosely consistent\n   view, depending on timing, updating, fetching, etc.\
    \  Thus, one cache\n   or router may have different data about a particular prefix\
    \ than\n   another cache or router.  There is no 'fix' for this, it is the\n \
    \  nature of distributed data with distributed caches.\n   Operators should beware\
    \ that RPKI caches are loosely synchronized,\n   even within a single AS.  Thus,\
    \ changes to the validity state of\n   prefixes could be different within an operator's\
    \ network.  In\n   addition, there is no guaranteed interval from when an RPKI\
    \ cache is\n   updated to when that new information may be pushed or pulled into\
    \ a\n   set of routers via this protocol.  This may result in sudden shifts\n\
    \   of traffic in the operator's network, until all of the routers in the\n  \
    \ AS have reached equilibrium with the validity state of prefixes\n   reflected\
    \ in all of the RPKI caches.\n   It is hoped that testing and deployment will\
    \ produce advice on cache\n   loading and timing for relying parties.\n   There\
    \ is some uncertainty about the origin AS of aggregates and what,\n   if any,\
    \ ROA can be used.  The long-range solution to this is the\n   deprecation of\
    \ AS_SETs; see [RFC6472].\n   As reliable access to the global RPKI and an operator's\
    \ caches (and\n   possibly other hosts, e.g., DNS root servers) is important,\
    \ an\n   operator should take advantage of relying-party tools that report\n \
    \  changes in BGP or RPKI data that would negatively affect validation\n   of\
    \ such prefixes.\n   Operators should be aware that there is a trade-off in placement\
    \ of\n   an RPKI repository in address space for which the repository's\n   content\
    \ is authoritative.  On one hand, an operator will wish to\n   maximize control\
    \ over the repository.  On the other hand, if there\n   are reachability problems\
    \ to the address space, changes in the\n   repository to correct them may not\
    \ be easily accessed by others.\n   Operators who manage certificates should associate\
    \ RPKI Ghostbusters\n   Records (see [RFC6493]) with each publication point they\
    \ control.\n   These are publication points holding the CRL, ROAs, and other signed\n\
    \   objects issued by the operator, and made available to other ASes in\n   support\
    \ of routing on the public Internet.\n   Routers that perform RPKI-based origin\
    \ validation must support Four-\n   octet AS Numbers (see [RFC6793]), as, among\
    \ other things, it is not\n   reasonable to generate ROAs for AS 23456.\n   Software\
    \ that produces filter lists or other control forms for\n   routers where the\
    \ target router does not support Four-octet AS\n   Numbers (see [RFC6793]) must\
    \ be prepared to accept four-octet AS\n   Numbers and generate the appropriate\
    \ two-octet output.\n   As a router must evaluate certificates and ROAs that are\
    \ time\n   dependent, routers' clocks MUST be correct to a tolerance of\n   approximately\
    \ an hour.\n   Servers should provide time service, such as NTPv4 [RFC5905], to\n\
    \   client routers.\n"
- title: 7.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "7.  Security Considerations\n   As the BGP origin AS of an update is not signed,\

    \   Origin validation does not address the problem of AS_PATH validation.\n  \
