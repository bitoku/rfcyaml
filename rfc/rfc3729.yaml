    \ the documents that describe the current\n   Internet-Standard Management Framework,\
    \ please refer to section 7 of\n   RFC 3410 [8].\n   Managed objects are accessed\
    \ via a virtual information store, termed\n   the Management Information Base\
    \ or MIB.  MIB objects are generally\n   accessed through the Simple Network Management\
    \ Protocol (SNMP).\n   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined\
    \ in the\n   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a\
    \ MIB\n   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,\n\
    \   RFC 2578 [1], STD 58, RFC 2579 [2] and STD 58, RFC 2580 [3].\n"
- title: 2.  Overview
  contents:
  - "2.  Overview\n   This document continues the architecture created in the RMON\
    \ MIB [7]\n   by providing analysis of application performance as experienced\
    \ by\n   end-users.\n   Application performance measurement measures the quality\
    \ of service\n   delivered to end-users by applications.  With this perspective,\
    \ a\n   true end-to-end view of the IT infrastructure results, combining the\n\
    \   performance of the application, desktop, network, and server, as well\n  \
    \ as any positive or negative interactions between these components.\n   Despite\
    \ all the technically sophisticated ways in which networking\n   and system resources\
    \ can be measured, human end-users perceive only\n   two things about an application:\
    \ availability and responsiveness.\n      Availability - The percentage of the\
    \ time that the application is\n      ready to give a user service.\n      Responsiveness\
    \ - The speed at which the application delivers the\n      requested service.\n\
    \   A transaction is an action initiated by a user that starts and\n   completes\
    \ a distributed processing function.  A transaction begins\n   when a user initiates\
    \ a request for service (i.e., pushing a submit\n   button) and ends when the\
    \ work is completed (i.e., information is\n   provided or a confirmation is delivered).\
    \  A transaction is the\n   fundamental item measured by the APM MIB.\n   A failed\
    \ transaction is a transaction that fails to provide the\n   service requested\
    \ by the end user, regardless of whether it is due to\n   a processing failure\
    \ or transport failure.\n   An application protocol (e.g., POP3) may implement\
    \ different commands\n   or application \"verbs\" (e.g., POP3 Login and POP3 Retrieval).\
    \  It\n   will often be interesting to monitor these verbs separately because:\n\
    \   1) The verbs may have widely differing performance characteristics\n     \
    \ (in fact some may be response time oriented while others are\n      throughput\
    \ oriented)\n   2) The verbs have varying business significance\n   3) It provides\
    \ more granularity of exactly what might be performing\n      poorly\n   This\
    \ MIB Module allows the measurement of a parent application, its\n   component\
    \ verbs, or both.  If monitoring both, one can watch the\n   top-level application\
    \ and then drill down to the verbs when trouble\n   is spotted to learn which\
    \ subcomponents are in trouble.  Each\n   application verb is registered separately\
    \ in the Protocol Directory\n   [5] [6] as a child of its parent application.\n\
    \   Application protocols implement one of three different types of\n   transactions:\
    \ transaction-oriented, throughput-oriented, or\n   streaming-oriented.  While\
    \ the availability metric is the same for\n   all three types, the responsiveness\
    \ metric varies:\n      Transaction-Oriented: These transactions have a fairly\
    \ constant\n      workload to perform for all transactions.  In particular, to\
    \ the\n      degree that the workload may vary, it doesn't vary based on the\n\
    \      amount of data to be transferred but based on the parameters of\n     \
    \ the transaction.  The responsiveness metric for transaction-\n      oriented\
    \ applications is application response time, the elapsed\n      time between the\
    \ user's request for service (e.g., pushing the\n      submit button) and the\
    \ completion of the request (e.g., displaying\n      the results) and is measured\
    \ in milliseconds.  This is commonly\n      referred to as end-user response time.\n\
    \      Throughput-Oriented: These transactions have widely varying\n      workloads\
    \ based on the amount of data requested.  The\n      responsiveness metric for\
    \ throughput-oriented applications is\n      kilobits per second.\n      Streaming-Oriented:\
    \ These transactions deliver data at a constant\n      metered rate of speed regardless\
    \ of excess capacity in the\n      networking and computing infrastructure.  However,\
    \ when the\n      infrastructures cannot deliver data at this speed, interruption\
    \ of\n      service or degradation of service can result.  The responsiveness\n\
    \      metric for streaming-oriented applications is the signal quality\n    \
    \  ratio of time that the service is degraded or interrupted to the\n      total\
    \ service time.  This metric is measured in parts per million.\n"
- title: 2.1.  Report Aggregation
  contents:
  - "2.1.  Report Aggregation\n   This MIB Module provides functions to aggregate\
    \ measurements into\n   higher level summaries.\n   Every transaction is identified\
    \ by its application, server, and\n   client and has an availability measure as\
    \ well as a responsiveness\n   measure.  The appropriate responsiveness measure\
    \ is context-sensitive\n   depending on whether the application is transaction-oriented,\n\
    \   throughput-oriented, or streaming- oriented.  For example, in a 5\n   minute\
    \ period several transactions might be recorded:\n   Application  Client  Server\

    \   Jane    HR        1             5 sec.\n   These transactions can be aggregated\
    \ in several ways, providing\n   statistical summaries - for example summarizing\
    \ all HTTP\n   transactions, or all HTTP transactions to the HR Server.  Note\
    \ that\n   data from different applications may not be summarized because:\n \
    \  1. The performance characteristics of different applications differ\n     \
    \ widely enough to render statistical analysis meaningless.\n   2. The responsiveness\
    \ metrics of different applications may be\n      different, making a statistical\
    \ analysis impossible (in other\n      words, one application may be transaction-oriented,\
    \ while another\n      is throughput-oriented).\n   Aggregating transactions collected\
    \ over a period requires an\n   aggregation algorithm.  In this MIB Module, transaction\
    \ aggregation\n   always results in the following statistics:\n   TransactionCount\n\
    \      The total number of transactions during this period\n   SuccessfulTransactions\n\
    \      The total number of transactions that were successful.  The\n      management\
    \ station can derive the percent success by dividing\n      SuccessfulTransactions\
    \ by the TransactionCount.\n   ResponsivenessMean\n      The average of the responsiveness\
    \ metric for all aggregated\n      transactions that completed successfully.\n\
    \   ResponsivenessMin\n      The minimum responsiveness metric for all aggregated\
    \ transactions\n      that completed successfully.\n   ResponsivenessMax\n   \
    \   The maximum responsiveness metric for all aggregated transactions\n      that\
    \ completed successfully.\n   ResponsivenessBx\n      The count of successful\
    \ transactions whose responsiveness metric\n      fell into the range specified\
    \ for Bx.  There are 7 buckets\n      specified.  Because the performance of different\
    \ applications\n      varies widely, the bucket ranges are specified separately\
    \ for each\n      application (in the apmAppDirTable) so that they may be tuned\
    \ to\n      typical performance of each application.\n   For example, when aggregating\
    \ the previous set of transactions by\n   application we get (for simplicity the\
    \ example only shows\n   TransactionCount, SuccessfulTransactions, and ResponsivenessMean):\n\
    \   Application  Count Successful      ResponsivenessMean\n   HTTP         4 \
    \    3               12 sec.\n   SAP/R3       1     1               17 sec.\n\

    \           100.0%\n   There are four different types of aggregation.\n      The\
    \ flows(1) aggregation is the simplest.  All transactions that\n      share common\
    \ application/server/client 3-tuples are aggregated\n      together, resulting\
    \ in a set of metrics for all such unique 3-\n      tuples.\n      The clients(2)\
    \ aggregation results in somewhat more aggregation\n      (i.e., fewer resulting\
    \ records).  All transactions that share\n      common application/client tuples\
    \ are aggregated together,\n      resulting in a set of metrics for all such unique\
    \ tuples.\n      The servers(3) aggregation usually results in still more\n  \
    \    aggregation (i.e., fewer resulting records).  All transactions\n      that\
    \ share common application/server tuples are aggregated\n      together, resulting\
    \ in a set of metrics for all such unique\n      tuples.\n      The applications(4)\
    \ aggregation results in the most aggregation\n      (i.e., the fewest resulting\
    \ records).  All transactions that share\n      a common application are aggregated\
    \ together, resulting in a set\n      of metrics for all such unique applications.\n\
    \   For example, if in a 5 minute period the following transactions\n   occurred:\n\
    \   Actual Transactions:\n   #   App      Client  Server   Successful    Responsiveness\n\
    \   1   HTTP     Jim     CallCtr  N             -\n   2   HTTP     Jim     HR\

    \ a few points:\n   1. How protocolDirEntries, apmHttpFilterEntries and\n    \
    \  apmUserDefinedAppEntries(not shown) all result in entries in the\n      apmAppDirTable.\n\
    \   2. How a single appLocalIndex may be represented multiple times in\n     \
    \ the apmAppDirTable and apmReportTable if the agent measures\n      multiple\
    \ responsiveness types for that application.\n   A convention in the formatting\
    \ of these tables is that the columns to\n   the left of the '|' separator are\
    \ index columns for the table.\n   Assuming the following entries in the RMON2\
    \ protocolDirectory:\n   protocolDirectory\n   ID (*)     Parameters   |    LocalIndex\
    \ ...\n   WWW        None         |    1\n   WWW Get    None         |    2\n\

    \            | On      ...\n   The entries in the apmAppDirTable with an appLocalIndex\
    \ of 1, 2 and 3\n   correspond to the identically named entries in the protocolDirectory\n\
    \   table.  appLocalIndex #1 results in 2 entries, one to measure the\n   transaction\
    \ responsiveness of WWW and one to measure its throughput\n   responsiveness.\
    \  In contrast, appLocalIndex #3 results in only a\n   transaction entry because\
    \ the agent does not measure the throughput\n   responsiveness for SAP/R3 (probably\
    \ because it isn't very\n   meaningful).  Finally, appLocalIndex #20 corresponds\
    \ to the entry in\n   the apmHttpFilterTable and has transaction responsiveness\
    \ and\n   throughput responsiveness measurements available.\n   If a report was\
    \ configured using application aggregation, entries in\n   that report might look\
    \ like:\n   apmReportTable\n   CtlIndex Index AppLocalIdx  ResponsivenessType\
    \ | TransactionCount ...\n   1        1     1            transaction(1)     |\

    \   Note that the index items protocolDirLocalIndex,\n   apmReportServerAddress\

- title: 2.3.  Measurement Methodology
  contents:
  - "2.3.  Measurement Methodology\n   There are many different measurement methodologies\
    \ available for\n   measuring application performance (e.g., probe-based, client-based,\n\
    \   synthetic-transaction, etc.).  This specification does not mandate a\n   particular\
    \ methodology - it is open to any that meet the minimum\n   requirements.  Conformance\
    \ to this specification requires that the\n   collected data match the semantics\
    \ described herein.  In particular,\n   a data collection methodology must be\
    \ able to measure response time,\n   throughput, streaming responsiveness and\
    \ availability as specified.\n   Note that in some cases a transaction may run\
    \ for a long time but\n   ultimately be successful.  The measurement software\
    \ shouldn't\n   prematurely classify lengthy transactions as failures but should\
    \ wait\n   as long as the client application will wait for a successful\n   response.\n"
- title: 2.4.  Instrumentation Architectures
  contents:
  - "2.4.  Instrumentation Architectures\n   Different architectural approaches and\
    \ deployment strategies may be\n   taken towards implementation of this specification.\
    \  If a highly\n   distributed approach is desired (e.g., an agent per desktop),\
    \ one or\n   both of the two approaches below may be used to make it more\n  \
    \ practical.\n"
- title: 2.4.1.  Application Directory Caching
  contents:
  - "2.4.1.  Application Directory Caching\n   It is necessary for the manager to\
    \ have a copy of the tables that\n   define the Application Directory in order\
    \ to interpret APM\n   measurements.  It is likely that in a highly distributed\
    \ network of\n   thousands of APM agents, this Application Directory will be the\
    \ same\n   on many, if not all of the agents.  Repeated downloads of the\n   Application\
    \ Directory may be inefficient.\n   The apmAppDirID object is a single object\
    \ that identifies the\n   configuration of all aspects of the Application Directory\
    \ when it is\n   equal to a well-known, registered configuration.  Thus, when\
    \ a\n   manager sees an apmAppDirID value that it recognizes, it need not\n  \
    \ download the Application Directory from that agent.  In fact, the\n   manager\
    \ may discover a new registered Application Directory\n   configuration on one\
    \ agent and then re-use that configuration on\n   another agent that shares the\
    \ same apmAppDirID value.\n   Application directory registrations are unique within\
    \ an\n   administrative domain, allowing an administrator to create a custom\n\
    \   application directory configuration without the need to assign it a\n   globally-unique\
    \ registration.\n"
- title: 2.4.2.  Push Model
  contents:
  - "2.4.2.  Push Model\n   When APM agents are installed on \"desktops\" (including\
    \ laptops), a\n   few issues make polling difficult:\n   1. Desktops often have\
    \ dynamically-assigned addresses so there is no\n      long-lived address to poll.\n\
    \   2. Desktops are not available as much as infrastructure components\n     \
    \ due to crashes, user-initiated reboots and shutdowns and user\n      control\
    \ over monitoring software.  Thus a desktop may not be\n      available to answer\
    \ a poll at the moment when the manager is\n      scheduled to poll that desktop.\n\
    \   3. Laptops that are connected via dialup connections are only\n      sporadically\
    \ connected and will routinely be unreachable when the\n      manager is scheduled\
    \ to poll.\n   As a consequence, a push model is usually more appropriate for\n\
    \   desktop-based agents.  To achieve this, the agent should follow the\n   following\
    \ rules in deciding what data to send in notifications.\n   APM Reports\n    \
    \   If an agent wishes to push APM reports to a manager, it\n       must send:\n\
    \           apmAppDirID\n           apmNameTable (any data updated since the last\
    \ push)\n       For each report the agent wishes to upload, it must\n       send\
    \ the entire apmReportControlEntry associated with\n       that report and the\
    \ associated entries in the\n       apmReportTable that have changed since the\
    \ last report.\n   APM Transactions\n       If an agent wishes to push APM transactions\
    \ to\n       a manager, it must send:\n           apmAppDirID\n           apmNameTable\
    \ (any data updated since the last push)\n           apmTransactionTable (relevant\
    \ entries)\n   APM Exceptions\n       The agent must send:\n           apmAppDirID\n\
    \           apmNameTable (any data updated since the last push)\n           apmTransactionEntry\
    \ (of exception transaction)\n           apmExceptionEntry (entry that generated\
    \ exception)\n     [Note that this list supersedes the information in the\n  \
    \   OBJECTS clauses of the apmTransactionResponsivenessAlarm\n     and apmTransactionUnsuccessfulAlarm\
    \ when the agent is\n     using a push model.  This additional information\n \
    \    eliminates the need for the manager to request additional\n     data to understand\
    \ the exception.]\n   The order of varbinds and where to segment varbinds into\
    \ PDUs is at\n   the discretion of the agent.\n"

- title: 2.5.4.  The APM Transaction Group

    \ transactions that are\n   currently in progress and ones that have ended recently,\
    \ along with\n   their responsiveness metric.\n   Because many transactions last\
    \ a very short time and because an agent\n   may not retain completed transactions\
    \ very long, transactions may\n   exist in this table for a very short time. \
    \ Thus, polling this table\n   isn't an effective mechanism for retrieving all\
    \ transactions unless\n   the value of apmTransactionsHistorySize is suitably\
    \ large for the\n   transactions being monitored.\n   One important benefit of\
    \ this table is that it allows a management\n   station to check on the status\
    \ of long-lived transactions.  Because\n   the apmReport and apmException mechanisms\
    \ act only on transactions\n   that have finished, a network manager may not have\
    \ visibility for\n   some time into the performance of long-lived transactions\
    \ such as\n   streaming applications, large data transfers, or (very) poorly\n\
    \   performing transactions.  In fact, by their very definition, the\n   apmReport\
    \ and apmException mechanisms only provide visibility into a\n   problem after\
    \ nothing can be done about it.  This group consists\n   primarily of the apmTransactionTable.\n"

    \        \"A locally arbitrary unique identifier associated with an\n        application\
    \ or application verb.\n        All objects of type AppLocalIndex are assigned\
    \ by the agent\n        out of a common number space. In other words, AppLocalIndex\n\

    \     For example, if the protocolDirLocalIndex values { 1, 3, 5, 7 }\n      \
    \  have been assigned, and the apmHttpFilterAppLocalIndex values\n        { 6,\

    \  - AppLocalIndex values { 1, 3, 5, 7 } are automatically\n              assigned\

    \ may be found in the\n        apmReportTable.\n        The flows(1) aggregation\
    \ is the simplest. All transactions\n        that share common application/server/client\

    \ a fairly constant\n        workload to perform for all transactions. The responsiveness\n\
    \        metric for transaction-oriented applications is application\n       \
    \ response time (from first request to final delivery of\n        service) and\
    \ is measured in milliseconds. This is\n        commonly referred to as end-user\
    \ response time.\n        Throughput-Oriented applications have widely varying\
    \ workloads\n        based on the nature of the client request. In particular,\n\
    \        throughput-oriented applications vary widely in the amount of\n     \
    \   data that must be transported to satisfy the request. The\n        responsiveness\
    \ metric for throughput-oriented applications is\n        kilobits per second.\n\
    \        Streaming-Oriented applications deliver data at a constant\n        metered\
    \ rate of speed regardless of the responsiveness of the\n        networking and\
    \ computing infrastructure. This constant rate of\n        speed is generally\

    \ data at this speed,\n        interruption of service or degradation of service\
    \ can\n        result. The responsiveness metric for streaming-oriented\n    \
    \    applications is the ratio of time that the service is degraded\n        or\
    \ interrupted to the total service time. This metric is\n        measured in parts\

    \    STATUS     current\n    DESCRIPTION\n        \"This object allows managers\
    \ to avoid downloading application\n        directory information when the directory\
    \ is set to a known\n        (usually fixed) configuration.\n        If the value\
    \ of this object isn't 0.0, it signifies\n        that the entire contents of\
    \ the apmAppDirTable,\n        apmHttpFilterTable, apmUserDefinedAppTable and\n\
    \        protocolDirTable are equal to a known state identified\n        by the\
    \ value of this object. If a manager recognizes this\n        value as identifying\
    \ a directory configuration it has a local\n        copy of, it may use this local\
    \ copy rather than downloading\n        these tables. Note that it may have downloaded\
    \ this local copy\n        (and the ID) from another agent and used this copy\
    \ for all\n        other agents that advertised the same ID.\n        If an agent\
    \ recognizes that the entire contents of the\n        apmAppDirTable, apmHttpFilterTable,\n\
    \        apmUserDefinedAppTable and protocolDirTable are equal to\n        a known\
    \ state to which an ID has been assigned, it should set\n        this object to\
    \ that ID.\n        In many cases when this feature is used, the application\n\
    \        directory information will be in read-only memory and thus the\n    \
    \    tables may not be modified via SNMP requests. In the event\n        that\
    \ the tables are writable and a modification is made, the\n        agent is responsible\
    \ for setting this object to 0.0 if it\n        cannot determine that the state\
    \ is equal to a known state.\n        An agent is not obligated to recognize and\
    \ advertise all such\n        registered states as it may not have knowledge of\
    \ all states.\n        Thus, a manager may encounter agents whose DirectoryID\
    \ value\n        is 0.0 even though the contents of the directory were equal to\n\
    \        a registered state.\n        Note that the contents of those tables includes\
    \ the\n        protocolDirLocalIndex and appLocalIndex values. In other\n    \
    \    words, these values can't be assigned randomly on each agent,\n        but\
    \ must be equal to values that are part of the known\n        state. While it\
    \ is possible for a manager to download\n        application directory details\
    \ using SNMP and to set the\n        appropriate directoryID, the manager would\
    \ need to have some\n        scheme to ensure consistent values of LocalIndex\
    \ variables\n        from agent to agent. Such schemes are outside the scope of\n\
    \        this specification.\n        Application directory registrations are\
    \ unique within an\n        administrative domain.\n        Typically these registrations\
    \ will be made by an agent\n        software developer who will set the application\
    \ directory\n        tables to a read-only state and assign a DirectoryID to that\n\
    \        state. Thus, all agents running this software would share the\n     \
    \   same DirectoryID. As the application directory might change\n        from\
    \ one software release to the next, the developer may\n        register different\
    \ DirectoryID's for each software release.\n        A customer could also create\
    \ a site-wide application directory\n        configuration and assign a DirectoryID\
    \ to that configuration\n        as long as consistent values of LocalIndex variables\
    \ can be\n        ensured.\n        The value of this object must persist across\
    \ reboots.\"\n     ::= { apmMibObjects 3 }\n"

    \  not-accessible\n    STATUS      current\n    DESCRIPTION\n        \"A client\
    \ machine may have multiple addresses during a period\n        of monitoring.\
    \ The apmNameTable assigns a long-lived\n        identifier to a client and records\
    \ what addresses were\n        assigned to that client for periods of time. Various\n\
    \        implementation techniques exist for tracking this mapping but\n     \
    \   if an agent is unable to track client address mappings, it may\n        map\
    \ client identifiers to client addresses rather than to\n        distinct client\
    \ machines.\n        A particular apmNameClientID should be a constant attribute\
    \ of\n        a particular client. When available, the agent may also record\n\
    \        the machine name and/or user name which may be valuable for\n       \
    \ displaying to humans. The apmNameMachineName and\n        apmNameUserName are\
    \ relatively constant, changing only if\n        these attributes actually change\
    \ on the client.\n        The agent will store a historical log of these entries,\
    \ aging\n        out old entries as the log becomes too large. Since this table\n\
    \        contains information vital to the interpretation of other\n        tables\
    \ (e.g., the apmReportTable), the agent should ensure that\n        the log doesn't\
    \ age out entries that would be referenced by\n        data in those tables.\n\
    \        Note that an entry for a clientID is active from its\n        StartTime\
    \ until the StartTime of another entry (for the same\n        clientID) that supersedes\
    \ it, or 'now' if none supersede\n        it. Therefore, if a clientID only has\
    \ a single entry, it is by\n        definition very new and should never be aged\
    \ out. No entry for\n        a clientID should be aged out unless it has been\
    \ updated by a\n        new entry for the client (i.e., with an updated address)\
    \ and\n        only if the new entry is 'old' enough.\n        To determine how\
    \ old is old enough, compute the maximum value\n        of Interval * (NumReports\
    \ + 1) of all entries in the\n        apmReportControlTable (the '+ 1' is to allow\
    \ a reasonable\n        period of time for the report to be downloaded). Then\
    \ take the\n        larger of this value and the age in seconds of the oldest\n\
    \        entry in the current transaction table. If an entry for a\n        clientID\
    \ is superseded by another entry whose StartTime is\n        more than this many\
    \ seconds ago, then the older entry may be\n        deleted.\"\n    ::= { apmMibObjects\

  - "4.  Security Considerations\n   There are a number of management objects defined\
    \ in this MIB module\n   with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.\
    \  Such\n   objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network\n\
    \   environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure\n   environment\
    \ without proper protection can have a negative effect on\n   network operations.\n\
    \   Specifically, most of the read-write and read-create objects in this\n   MIB\
    \ module may be used to configure an agent to reveal network\n   addresses, application\
    \ usage information and conversation statistics\n   that may be considered sensitive\
    \ in some environments.\n   Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e.,\
    \ objects with a\n   MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered sensitive\
    \ or\n   vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus important to\n \
    \  control even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly\n   to\
    \ even encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over\n   the network\
    \ via SNMP.\n   Specifically, this MIB contains network addresses, machines names,\n\
    \   user names, application usage information, and conversation\n   statistics.\
    \  Data of this nature should be considered sensitive and\n   the privacy of the\
    \ users from whom it was gathered protected.\n   Administrators should restrict\
    \ read access to this data to\n   specifically authorized individuals or agents\
    \ that recognize the\n   privacy implications of its release.  In situations where\
    \ read access\n   to this data cannot be restricted, it should not be gathered.\n\
    \   Systems that implement the objects in this MIB module have the\n   capability\
    \ of measuring the time taken to execute transactions.\n   Depending on the transaction\
    \ type, some or all of this transaction\n   time may be associated with the time\
    \ taken to perform security\n   calculations.  Such data may help an attacker\
    \ to use timing attacks\n   to extract secrets from the systems involved in the\
    \ transactions.\n   See [10] for more information.\n   SNMP versions prior to\
    \ SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.\n   Even if the network itself is\
    \ secure (for example by using IPSec),\n   even then, there is no control as to\
    \ who on the secure network is\n   allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete)\
    \ the objects\n   in this MIB module.\n   It is RECOMMENDED that implementers\
    \ consider the security features as\n   provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see\
    \ [8], section 8), including full\n   support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms\
    \ (for authentication\n   and privacy).\n   Further, deployment of SNMP versions\
    \ prior to SNMPv3 is NOT\n   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy\
    \ SNMPv3 and to\n   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator\n\
    \   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an\n   instance\
    \ of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to\n   the objects\
    \ only to those principals (users) that have legitimate\n   rights to indeed GET\
    \ or SET (change/create/delete) them.\n"
