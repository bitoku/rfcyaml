Form name is a character string whose maximum length is 6, and whose first character is alphabetic.
Decimal is the default radix and positive the default sign.
Job name is a character string whose maximum length is 6, and whose first character is alphabetic.
The currently acceptable password is 'ARPA'.
TTY List is one or more TTY numbers, separated by commas.
TTY number is an integer representing a DRS terminal identification number.
Command Descriptions: 'ATTACH' <tty no.
Connects the user's console to the DRS/TTS terminal with identification number
> must have been previously detached, and must not have been deleted.
(Currently, detached terminals are deleted after 1 hour.)
CA> Causes links to the terminals specified in <tty list> to be broken.
If <tty list> is not specified, all established links are broken.
(See 'LINK', 'MONITOR', and 'SELECT' for a description of how links are established.) 'COMPILE' <
Causes form <formid> to be compiled.
Verification that the source for form <formid> exists, and that object code does not already exist is made before invoking the DRS Compiler, which executes asynchronously to the user's terminal.
The DRS Compiler generates a diagnostic file for the form and, if no errors are encountered, object files.
<job name> is used to identify the request and may not be used to identify any other job so long as the current request is outstanding.
Because of main storage requirements, only one compilation is allowed in execution at any time.
Subsequent requests are queued for later execution unless the request queue is full, in which case the request is refused.
The user is notified when his compilation is initiated, and when it terminates. '
Allows the user to convert octal, decimal, or hexadecimal integers from one radix to another.
<base> specifies the desired radix of the result and may be 'OCTAL', DECIMAL', or 'HEXADECIMAL'. '
Allows the user to define a new source form, or append to an existing source form.
Unfortunately, the current facilities for editing forms are extremely limited.
Only the line currently being entered may be edited.
Once a line has been terminated, with CR LF, and the new line indicator has appeared, the line may not be edited.
The following control characters may be used to edit a form while it is being defined.
Control A (SOH) or Rubout (DEL) delete the last character,
control X (CAN) deletes the entire line, and control F (ACK) displays the entire line.
If modifications need to be made to lines other than the current line, the entire form must be deleted and reentered. '
> <CA> Deletes the specified component file(s) of form <formid>. <file type
> specifies the component file to be deleted, either 'SOURCE', 'DIAGNOSTIC', or 'OBJECT CODE'.
If <file type> is not specified, all components of the form are deleted. '
Breaks the TELNET connection between DRS and the user, but does not delete the user's DRS terminal for some fixed period of time, currently 1 hour.
Any jobs the terminal has active are unaffected when the terminal is detached.
The user may subsequently reconnect to his DRS terminal by using the 'ATTACH' command. '
Lists which component(s) of form <formid> exist.
A complete form consists of 'SOURCE', 'DIAGNOSTICS', and 'OBJECT CODE' files. '
Breaks the TELNET connection between DRS and the user and deletes the user's DRS terminal.
Any jobs the terminal has active are purged. '
Directs DRS to echo user input; nullifies a previous 'LINE AT A TIME' command. '
Directs DRS not to echo user input nullifies a previous 'LINE AT
HELP' <CA> Lists the DRS control characters and their meanings. '
Tells DRS that the user is operating in line at a time mode, and nullifies a previous 'FULLDUPLEX' or 'HALFDUPLEX' command.
DRS will not send any output to the user while he is inputting commands. '
The link command may be used to enable or disable links to other terminals, or to establish links between terminals. '
<CA> directs DRS to allow subsequent request by other terminals to establish links with the user's terminal. '
LINK' 'DISABLE' <CA> directs DRS to refuse subsequent request by other terminals to establish links with the user's terminal. '
<CA> requests DRS to establish bidirectional links between the user's terminal and the terminals specified in <tty list
If <tty list> is omitted, DRS attempts to link the user's terminal to all other active terminals.
While the user's terminal is linked to another terminal, all output to the user's terminal will also be routed to the linked terminal, and all output to the linked terminal will also be routed to the user's terminal.
Unidirectional links may be established via the 'MONITOR' and 'SELECT' commands. '
LIST' [<file type>] <formid> <CA
Lists the contents of the <file type
> file of form <formid
>. <file type> may be 'SOURCE', 'DIAGNOSTIC' or 'OBJECT CODE', and defaults to 'SOURCE'. '
Logs the user in, enables job oriented commands, and specifies the account to which the use of DRS is to be billed.
Currently billing for DRS is not implemented, and <userid> and <acct
> may be arbitrarily chosen by the user.
When billing for DRS is implemented, user ID's and account numbers will be assigned and checked for validity at login.
The only currently acceptable <password> is 'ARPA'. '
<CA> Logs the user out and disables job oriented commands and billing of subsequent activity to the previously specified accounting parameters.
As with 'DISCONNECT', any jobs the terminal has active are purged. '
Requests DRS to establish unidirectional links between the user's terminal and the terminals specified in <tty list
If <tty list> is omitted, DRS attempts to link the user's terminal to all other active terminals.
While the user's terminal is monitoring another terminal, all output to that terminal will also be routed to the user's terminal. '
Requests DRS to purge the job (request for compilation or interpreting) identified by <job name
If <job name> is omitted, all active jobs are purged. '
Allows the user to specify the radix to be used for subsequent integer display.
<base> may be 'OCTAL', 'DECIMAL', or 'HEXADECIMAL'.
The default display radix is decimal. '
Allows the user to rename a form.
The names of all components of the form specified by the first <formid> are changed to correspond to the second <formid
If the form specified by the second <formid> already exists, no change of name occurs, and the user is notified. '
('ALL' 'HANDHOLD' 'PROMPT' 'NORMAL' '
Allows the user to specify the level of messages the system should provide.
The default response level is 'ALL'. '
RUN' <job name> ('SIMPLEX' <run parameters
CA> Causes DRS to establish the requested Network connections and direct the DRS interpreter to apply the specified form(s) to data passing over the connections.
The user first specifies the job name by which his request will be identified, and second whether simplex or duplex Network connections are to be established. '
SIMPLEX' implies that a single unidirectional message path is to be employed, and requires one set of <run parameters
<formid> Three methods are available for establishing Network connections: 'SICP', 'UICP', and 'RFC'. '
SICP (Server Initial Connection Protocol) and 'UICP' causes DRS to simulate a server process addressable through socket <socket number> at UCSB and wait for a user process to connect to it. '
UICP' directs DRS to simulate a user process and connect to the server addressable through Host <hostid>, socket <socket number>. '
RFC' directs DRS to connect directly to the two sockets specified.
In the case of 'RFC', one of the two sockets specified must be a send socket, and the other must be a receive socket.
<hostid> defaults to the Host from which the user logged into the DRS/TSS.
specifies the amount of time,
in seconds, that DRS should wait for the connection to be established.
The default value is 30 seconds. '
The default value for 'RUN TIME' is five minutes.
For each instance of <run parameters>, one socket pair is allocated and one form is specified.
In the case of 'SIMPLEX' runs, the Network data flows between these two sockets, with the form being applied to the data.
In the case of 'DUPLEX' runs, the connections are somewhat more complex.
For 'DUPLEX' runs, two sets of <run parameters> are specified, causing two socket pairs to be allocated, and two forms to be specified.
Call these send socket 1, receive socket 1, and form 1 (established via the first set of <run parameters> and send socket 2, receive socket 2, and form 2 (established via the second set of parameters).
When interpreting begins, data will flow from send socket 1, through form1, to receive socket 2, and from send socket 2, through form 2, to receive socket 1.
(Note that without this socket switching, processes would be connected to themselves when 'SICP' or 'UICP' is specified.)
The user is notified when his requests for connections are initiated and when the interpreter begins applying a form to a connection.
When execution of a form terminates, the user is supplied with a diagnostic message provided by the interpreter as well as the actual run time of the interpreter. '
CA> Requests DRS to establish unidirectional links between the user's terminal and the terminals specified in <tty list
If <tty list> is omitted, DRS attempts to link the user's terminal to all other active terminals.
Allows the user to enter any comments he chooses.
Note that <CA> must be CR LF, rather than period.
