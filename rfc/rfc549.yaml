  - "Monday Morning/Afternoon, 16 July\n   The meeting was called to order at 0930\n\
    \   Jim Michener distributed an outline of a paper describing desirable\n   facilities\
    \ for the use of two dimensional input devices with a\n   hierarchically structured\
    \ display program.\n   Ken Victor distributed copies of RFC 553: A Proposed Network\n\
    \   Text/Graphics Protocol. (LJOURNAL,17810,)\n   Ken Pogran described the history\
    \ of the NGG and how the \"levels\"\n   approach of RFC 493 came about.  In particular,\
    \ the \"level 0\"\n   protocol was an attempt to define something to experiment\
    \ with, but\n   with the thought that it should be possible to imbed \"level 0\"\
    \n   meaningfully in any later protocol.\n   Reports of Network Graphics Experiences\n\
    \      Jon Jervert described the installation at CAD/CAM (Fort Monmouth).\n  \
    \    They have a spectrum of display terminals and have tried several\n      via\
    \ a Telnet connection to MIT-DMCG.  They experienced\n      unacceptable slowness\
    \ with a 300 Baud bandwidth.\n      Austin Henderson described an Air Traffic\
    \ Control experiment in\n      which the simulator receives codes describing changes\
    \ in state and\n      generates descriptions of the air space (region) being controlled\n\
    \      and aircraft position and velocity.  These descriptions are highly\n  \
    \    encoded--they are not pictures in any general sense.  The rate at\n     \
    \ which the simulation proceeded was adequate.\n      Jim Michener described the\
    \ results of an experiment in which the\n      E&S LDS-1 at MIT-DMCG was used\
    \ to generate stylus inking input for\n      a character recognition program at\
    \ SDC.  The experiment was\n      plagued with difficulties including bugs in\
    \ SDC's NCP and\n      scheduling of experimental/debugging sessions.  When the\n\
    \      experiment was finally terminated (due to planned extensive\n      hardware\
    \ modifications at DMCG) a clear understanding had not yet\n      emerged, but\
    \ apparently network transmission delays had been\n      experienced of up to\
    \ 20 seconds.\n      Dan Cohen described an Aircraft Flight Simulator which interacts\n\
    \      with a user at the Harvard PDP-1.  The simulation takes place on a\n  \
    \    PDP-10.  Network traffic is approximately 200 bits from the PDP-1\n     \
    \ to the PDP-10 and several thousand bits in the opposite direction.\n      It\
    \ has been found that at least 5 updates are required per second\n      to give\
    \ the \"pilot\" an adequate feeling of control.  The Harvard\n      PDP-10 and\
    \ one at BBN have been used, the latter at 6 AM to avoid\n      loading problems.\n\
    \      John Pickens described UCSB's status regarding output in level 0\n    \
    \  Network Graphics Protocol (NGP-0).\n      Steve Bunch reported that he has\
    \ an Imlac monitor which accepts\n      NGP-0 directly.  Programs have been developed\
    \ at CCN (using\n      subroutine packages modeled after plotter packages) which\
    \ build\n      files containing pictures in NGP-0.  Other programs output the\n\
    \      pictures either to a Gould plotter or a storage display (in device\n  \
    \    specific code) or to an Imlac (in NGP-0 form).\n      Steve Holmgren briefly\
    \ described a Fancy Arpa Network Graphics\n      System (FANGS) under development\
    \ at UCSD.\n   Discussion of Modifications in the Graphics Protocol\n      David\
    \ Egli reported that he and Jim Foley (of Univ. of North\n      Carolina) thought\
    \ that the graphics protocol should have the\n      ability to replace items,\
    \ and that 3 dimensional data should be\n      allowable.  Jim Foley also thinks\
    \ that a subpicture call should be\n      able to specify a rate of rotation,\
    \ scaling, and translation, in\n      addition to initial values for these.\n\
    \      An extended coffee break followed to allow perusal of the\n      documents\
    \ distributed.\n      Elaine Thomas summarized her protocol proposal for a\n \
    \     hierarchically structured, editable display file.\n      Discussion related\
    \ to the levels approach of RFC 493 concluded\n      that levels were inappropriate;\
    \ we would henceforth think in terms\n      of negotiable options.\n      Ken\
    \ Victor stressed that NLS was particularly desirous of being\n      able to make\
    \ use of the graphics protocol; that was the reason for\n      their developing\
    \ RFC 553.\n      Ken Pogran observed that a structures display system as is being\n\
    \      proposed is more a distributed graphics system than a protocol,\n     \
    \ and that he thought this a good idea.  General consensus agreed\n      with\
    \ him.\n      Jim Michener described proposals for input.  He emphasized the\n\
    \      necessity of transmitting position information in figure\n      coordinates\
    \ as opposed to screen coordinates or top level figure\n      coordinates.\n \
    \     Bob Sproul described two different ways in which a graphics\n      application\
    \ in a serving host can communicate to a using host\n      controlling a display\
    \ device.\n         If the using host has complex enough software or hardware,\
    \ a\n         structured definition of the display may be sent.\n            A\
    \ structured display definition consists of figures (also\n            called\
    \ pictures or groups) which consist of units.  A unit\n            is either a\
    \ call to another figure or a collection of one or\n            more text or graphic\
    \ commands. (Other special purpose units\n            may exist, also.) Figures\
    \ and units have names and may be\n            created, replaced and deleted (and\
    \ other things).\n      A simpler scheme for the using host is that transformed\
    \ segmented\n      display information be sent across the network.\n      Segments\
    \ have names and can be individually created, replaced and\n      deleted.\n \
    \     Either the application works directly in terms of segments, or it\n    \
    \  works in terms of a structures display definition and software at\n      the\
    \ serving host has the responsibility of evaluating the\n      transformations\
    \ and the sub-figure calls.\n         It seems likely that such transformation\
    \ software might have to\n         exist at the serving host anyway if that host\
    \ has any graphics\n         terminals of small to moderate capability.\n    \
    \  It was agreed to restrict our attention to the simpler\n      \"transformed-segmented\"\
    \ scheme, and delay consideration of the\n      \"hierarchically structured\"\
    \ scheme until another meeting.\n         It seemed to the meeting that a significant\
    \ number of\n         applications would need nothing more powerful than a segmented\n\
    \         scheme.\n      One desirable mechanism is an \"end batch of updates\"\
    \ command.  It\n      can help optimize the use of a storage terminal and it can\
    \ let a\n      user program causes fixes to occur on a refresh tube all at once.\n\
    \   After lunch, Ira Cotton pointed out that it would be easy enough to\n   allow\
    \ NGP-0 to be upward compatible with a segmented, transformed\n   scheme.  Bob\
    \ Sproul agreed and said that that was a good argument for\n   sending only device\
    \ independent data on the net. (This idea was\n   modified in discussion on Tuesday.)\n\
    \   Ken Victor discussed TTY units, a mechanism for displaying characters\n  \
    \ which are \"unescorted\" i.e., are not part of a graphics \"text\"\n   command.\
    \  In particular they are for spontaneous messages from the\n   operating system\
    \ (like \"out of funds\" or \"going down in 5 min\").\n   General discussion was\
    \ undecided on whether TTY units should really\n   be part of a graphics protocol.\
    \ (This was later decided\n   affirmatively.)\n      It was noted that unescorted\
    \ characters coming from the serving\n      host could probably be handled, but\
    \ that those coming from the\n      using host might not be.\n"
- title: Discussion of Network Connection for Graphics
  contents:
  - "Discussion of Network Connection for Graphics\n   A graphics connection may start\
    \ out with a Telnet connection.  We\n   will request a DO GRAPHICS telnet option.\n\
    \   Multiplexing on the Telnet connection vs using a separate connection\n   pair.\n\
    \      Dan Cohen stated that his Flight Simulator uses a second pair.\n      Alex\
    \ McKenzie pointed out that some hosts have only \"read and\n      block\" input\
    \ commands, not \"read and continue\".  This means we\n      cannot demand to\
    \ have separate connection pairs with graphics on\n      one and telnet-type information\
    \ on the other.\n      Jim Hansen called for a show of hands of preferences: NLS\
    \ was the\n      only site against using multiple connection.  Several sites were\n\
    \      against multiplexing graphics information on the Telnet\n      connection.\
    \  Issues included:\n         It is easier to merge two streams at the user than\
    \ to split one\n         into two.  The latter requires \"smart\" programming.\n\
    \         TIP users may lose if multiple connections are required.\n         It\
    \ should be possible to do it on one connection.\n         In summary: two connections\
    \ are better than one, the number\n         shall be negotiated over the Telnet\
    \ connection.\n      Ira Cotton asked for a discussion of connection initiation\
    \ other\n      than via a Telnet connection.  It was agreed that we did not know\n\
    \      enough at this time to specify this and that it was a matter for\n    \
    \  experimentation.\n   Someone commented that what we have is a Network Virtual\
    \ Graphics\n   Terminal which has a Network Virtual Keyboard and a Network Virtual\n\
    \   Printer (in the Telnet sense) and a Network Virtual Display Unit.\n   The\
    \ printer and the display unit may be the same.\n   Ira Cotton announced that\
    \ Jim Foley (of Univ. of North Carolina) is\n   planning to have a workshop on\
    \ machine independent graphics under the\n   auspices of SIGGRAPH in Washington\
    \ D.C. around mid-April (cherry\n   blossom time).\n"
- title: Discussion of Graphics Input
  contents:
  - "Discussion of Graphics Input\n      Dan Cohen summarized the use of input in\
    \ his flight simulator:\n      since it comprises only approximately 200 bits\
    \ in toto, all\n      switches, knobs, and stylus position are transmitted.  This\
    \ takes\n      place about five times per second.\n      Austin Henderson described\
    \ the input facilities on the LL TX-2.\n         Attentions are enabled.  What\
    \ information will be desired when\n         a particular attention occurs is\
    \ described at the time the\n         attention is enabled.\n         When an\
    \ attention occurs, the system records the desired\n         information in a\
    \ queue for the application program.\n         When the application program is\
    \ next scheduled it examines the\n         queue and responds as it sees fit.\n\
    \      It was generally agreed to adopt the TX-2 strategy.  Input devices\n  \
    \    will not be enabled unless the server does so.\n         No restriction is\
    \ placed on any \"lies\" the using host wishes to\n         make regarding disguising\
    \ one device as another.\n      Network connections for input follow the same\
    \ rules as for output.\n      What input attentions are implemented at the using\
    \ host may be\n      determined by the serving host in response to an inquiry.\n\
    \      Inking will be provided by the using host (but only one inking\n      input\
    \ can be specified at a time; no buffering ahead shall be done\n      by the using\
    \ host).\n      Tracking means the feedback of the current two dimensional input\n\
    \      device position to the user.\n         This is automatically turned on\
    \ by Inking, Positioning, and\n         Targeting (hitting) attentions.\n   What\
    \ data are reported at the time of an attention is specified by\n   the application\
    \ at the server when the attention is enabled.\n   Types of attentions were listed\
    \ and also what additional optional\n   information could be specified with each.\n\
    \   Deactivating Inputs was discussed.\n      It is possible for the application\
    \ to explicitly deactivate an\n      attention.\n      When an attention is enabled\
    \ it shall be possible to specify when\n      it should be deactivated.  Three\
    \ modes were mentioned: Never\n      turned off (until the application explicitly\
    \ does so), turned off\n      when it occurs (self-destruct), turned off when\
    \ any attention\n      occurs.\n      The need for a synchronization message was\
    \ agreed upon.\n   It was agreed that the serving host - using host relationship\
    \ would\n   be one of master - slave.  Among other things, the using host would\n\
    \   never volunteer input information which the serving host\n   (application)\
    \ had not asked for.\n   It was decided to meet the next morning at 0830\n   The\
    \ meeting adjourned about 1830\n"

  - "Monday Evening, 16 July\n   About 2030 seven of us met in Ken Victor's room\n\
    \   Bob Sproul led the meeting and kept track of the various aspects of\n   the\
    \ protocol.\n   Protocol topics which had been discussed during the day's meeting\n\
    \   were covered again.  Most aspects were firmed up based on the day's\n   discussions.\
    \  Several topics were identified for discussion in the\n   morning.\n   Operations\
    \ on and attributes of segments were defined.\n   The server should be able to\
    \ enquire for various information from the\n   using host.\n      Whether the\
    \ using host has all the features implemented (which the\n      application needs).\n\
    \      What input devices the human has at his disposal.\n      What sort of terminal\
    \ is being used, not so as to send device\n      specific code to it, but so that\
    \ the application does not try to\n      use some graphics programming technique\
    \ on a terminal which can\n      not handle it (e.g., some sort of dynamics on\
    \ a storage tube).\n   The server may request that the using host report what\
    \ segments have\n   been defined, their status, and what is contained in then.\
    \  This is\n   good for debugging, and also provides a limited facility of building\n\
    \   a picture then dumping it to some storage medium other than a\n   graphics\
    \ device.\n   It was pointed out that the effect of multiple changes in the display\n\
    \   (replacing, inserting and deleting segments) should occur \"all at\n   once\"\
    \ when an \"end batch of updates\" command is received by the using\n   host.\n\
    \      For a refreshed display, this means keeping old and new copies of\n   \
    \   segments until the \"batch\" command is received.\n      This rule may be\
    \ waived if storage limitations dictate.\n   There was considerable discussion\
    \ on input.  It was felt to be the\n   least firm of any aspects of the protocol.\n\
    \   The meeting broke up around 0030?\n"
- title: Tuesday Morning/Afternoon, 17 July
  contents:
  - "Tuesday Morning/Afternoon, 17 July\n   Bob Sproul presented the results of the\
    \ previous evening's discussion\n   to the whole meeting.\n   The features required\
    \ of a graphics user program under the proposed\n   protocol were divided into\
    \ three classes:\n      Required features included segment manipulation, primitive\n\
    \      graphics output operations, and response to queries from the\n      server\
    \ regarding what is implemented at the using host, what input\n      devices the\
    \ human has available, etc.\n      Optional features included TTY units, reporting\
    \ the contents of a\n      segment back to the server at his request.\n      Experimental\
    \ features included Input.\n         It was assumed that after some experience,\
    \ experimental\n         features would become either required or optional.\n\
    \      A full list of required, optional, and experimental features will\n   \
    \   be issued as a supplement to the description of the protocol.\n   A graphics\
    \ server program need only implement those features which\n   applications at\
    \ that site make use of.\n   There was some discussion regarding how and when\
    \ the graphics\n   protocol should be published.\n      The protocol is still\
    \ regarded as experimental, and we wouldn't\n      want any site to assume otherwise,\
    \ to their later dismay.\n      Some worry was expressed about finally presenting\
    \ this protocol to\n      the Network Community in a form that would not frighten\
    \ too many\n      people.\n      Ira Cotton advised us to include a glossary.\n\
    \      Bob Sproul will put an initial version (skeleton) of a description\n  \
    \    of the graphics protocol for transformed-segmented scheme into NLS\n    \
    \  and will invite everybody in the group to edit it (in normal NLS\n      fashion).\n\
    \         When one does editing normally, one's ident, the date and the\n    \
    \     time are associated with each statement one touches.  This\n         information\
    \ can be seen via the viewspec (capital) K.\n   There was some discussion of whether\
    \ Level 0 NGP could be imbedded in\n   the Transformed-segmented graphics protocol.\n\
    \      One unfortunate part of NGP-0 was that an End-Picture the is not\n    \
    \  explicitly required in order to see something.  If it were\n      required,\
    \ then it could act like an end-batch-of-updates command.\n         UCSB assumes\
    \ that NGP-0 works like a storage tube.  They append\n         a new function\
    \ plot to an existing picture never having sent an\n         End-Picture operation.\n\
    \      This ability to append in a storage tube fashion struck the\n      processors\
    \ of refresh tubes as quite a drawback, because of\n      implementation difficulties.\n\
    \      It was decided to allow a using site to have NGP-0 compatibility,\n   \
    \   but not to require it.\n         At least the NGP-0 opcodes would not be reused.\n\
    \   Except for the End-Picture problem, and possibly also a coordinate\n   system\
    \ problem (coordsys), NGP-0 can be imbedded in the transformed-\n   segmented\
    \ protocol with the entire NGP-0 picture corresponding to a\n   single segment.\n\
    \   The following sites hope to achieve implementations of the\n   experimental\
    \ segmented protocol:\n      UCSB hopes to have a server running for OLS and Signal\
    \ Analysis\n      (speech processing).\n      SRI-ARC hopes to have NLS operate\
    \ in this protocol.\n      MIT-DMCG may have some simple serving programs.\n \
    \     Several people plan to implement user programs, at least as far as\n   \
    \   the required features go.\n   (coordsys) A discussion arose concerning what\
    \ coordinate system\n   should be used in sending graphics output primitives from\
    \ the server\n   to the user.\n      The following problems were addressed:\n\
    \         What happens if the display segment terminal screen area to be\n   \
    \      used by the application is not rectangular?\n         What happens if the\
    \ basic unit delta X is not the same as the\n         unit delta y? The application\
    \ might want a 45 degree line to\n         really be at 45 degrees.\n      Various\
    \ answers to the first question:\n      Use the largest square within the rectangle\
    \ (centered?, adjusted\n      to the left, top, right, or bottom?)\n      Use\
    \ the smallest square surrounding the rectangle. (How is the\n      rectangle\
    \ positioned in the square?)\n      NGP-0 standard coordinates (-1/2 to +1/2)\
    \ used and mapped into the\n      whole rectangle.\n      The user reports left,\
    \ bottom, right, and top physical coordinates\n      and the server sends coordinates\
    \ within the range given.\n         This is compatible with the attitude that\
    \ the transformed (!)\n         segmented graphics data are sent.\n         It\
    \ is also saves the using host (which might be an Imlac) from\n         doing\
    \ a multiply.\n   John Pickens observed that if a graphics server for a finicky\n\
    \   application transmits characters as strokes, then the application is\n   assured\
    \ of having the characters positioned in exactly the right\n   place (e.g., for\
    \ a numeric label on a tic mark on the axis of a\n   graph.  If characters are\
    \ sent as text (not strokes) positioning is\n   not necessarily guaranteed.\n\
    \   Ken Victor and Jim Michener will look into ways of keeping the NGG\n   apprised\
    \ of progress (in terms of what sites have\n   experimental/operational graphics\
    \ protocol servers or user programs)\n   using a pointer file in the NIC.\n  \
    \ The next NGG meeting is tentatively scheduled for the first Sunday in\n   February\
    \ 73, at 8PM.  It will either be at the NIC or partly there\n   and partly at\
    \ Xerox PARC.\n   The meeting was adjourned at 1500.\n"
