  - "Abstract\n   The differentiated services framework enables quality-of-service\n\
    \   provisioning within a network domain by applying rules at the edges\n   to\
    \ create traffic aggregates and coupling each of these with a\n   specific forwarding\
    \ path treatment in the domain through use of a\n   codepoint in the IP header.\
    \  The diffserv WG has defined the general\n   architecture for differentiated\
    \ services and has focused on the\n   forwarding path behavior required in routers,\
    \ known as \"per-hop\n   forwarding behaviors\" (or PHBs).  The WG has also discussed\n\
    \   functionality required at diffserv (DS) domain edges to select\n   (classifiers)\
    \ and condition (e.g., policing and shaping) traffic\n   according to the rules.\
    \  Short-term changes in the QoS goals for a DS\n   domain are implemented by\
    \ changing only the configuration of these\n   edge behaviors without necessarily\
    \ reconfiguring the behavior of\n   interior network nodes.\n   The next step\
    \ is to formulate examples of how forwarding path\n   components (PHBs, classifiers,\
    \ and traffic conditioners) can be used\n   to compose traffic aggregates whose\
    \ packets experience specific\n   forwarding characteristics as they transit a\
    \ differentiated services\n   domain.  The WG has decided to use the term per-domain\
    \ behavior, or\n   PDB, to describe the behavior experienced by a particular set\
    \ of\n   packets as they cross a DS domain.  A PDB is characterized by\n   specific\
    \ metrics that quantify the treatment a set of packets with a\n   particular DSCP\
    \ (or set of DSCPs) will receive as it crosses a DS\n   domain.  A PDB specifies\
    \ a forwarding path treatment for a traffic\n   aggregate and, due to the role\
    \ that particular choices of edge and\n   PHB configuration play in its resulting\
    \ attributes, it is where the\n   forwarding path and the control plane interact.\
    \  The measurable\n   parameters of a PDB should be suitable for use in Service\
    \ Level\n   Specifications at the network edge.\n   This document defines and\
    \ discusses Per-Domain Behaviors in detail\n   and lays out the format and required\
    \ content for contributions to the\n   Diffserv WG on PDBs and the procedure that\
    \ will be applied for\n   individual PDB specifications to advance as WG products.\
    \  This format\n   is specified to expedite working group review of PDB submissions.\n"

  - "1 Introduction\n   Differentiated Services allows an approach to IP Quality of\
    \ Service\n   that is modular, incrementally deployable, and scalable while\n\
    \   introducing minimal per-node complexity [RFC2475].  From the end\n   user's\
    \ point of view, QoS should be supported end-to-end between any\n   pair of hosts.\
    \  However, this goal is not immediately attainable.  It\n   will require interdomain\
    \ QoS support, and many untaken steps remain\n   on the road to achieving this.\
    \  One essential step, the evolution of\n   the business models for interdomain\
    \ QoS, will necessarily develop\n   outside of the IETF.  A goal of the diffserv\
    \ WG is to provide the\n   firm technical foundation that allows these business\
    \ models to\n   develop.  The first major step will be to support edge-to-edge\
    \ or\n   intradomain QoS between the ingress and egress of a single network,\n\
    \   i.e., a DS Domain in the terminology of RFC 2474.  The intention is\n   that\
    \ this edge-to-edge QoS should be composable, in a purely\n   technical sense,\
    \ to a quantifiable QoS across a DS Region composed of\n   multiple DS domains.\n\
    \   The Diffserv WG has finished the first phase of standardizing the\n   behaviors\
    \ required in the forwarding path of all network nodes, the\n   per-hop forwarding\
    \ behaviors or PHBs.  The PHBs defined in RFCs 2474,\n   2597 and 2598 give a\
    \ rich toolbox for differential packet handling by\n   individual boxes.  The\
    \ general architectural model for diffserv has\n   been documented in RFC 2475.\
    \  An informal router model [MODEL]\n   describes a model of traffic conditioning\
    \ and other forwarding\n   behaviors.  However, technical issues remain in moving\
    \ \"beyond the\n   box\" to intradomain QoS models.\n   The ultimate goal of creating\
    \ scalable end-to-end QoS in the Internet\n   requires that we can identify and\
    \ quantify behavior for a group of\n   packets that is preserved when they are\
    \ aggregated with other packets\n   as they traverse the Internet.  The step of\
    \ specifying forwarding\n   path attributes on a per-domain basis for a set of\
    \ packets\n   distinguished only by the mark in the DS field of individual packets\n\
    \   is critical in the evolution of Diffserv QoS and should provide the\n   technical\
    \ input that will aid in the construction of business models.\n   This document\
    \ defines and specifies the term \"Per-Domain Behavior\" or\n   PDB to describe\
    \ QoS attributes across a DS domain.\n   Diffserv classification and traffic conditioning\
    \ are applied to\n   packets arriving at the boundary of a DS domain to impose\n\
    \   restrictions on the composition of the resultant traffic aggregates,\n   as\
    \ distinguished by the DSCP marking , inside the domain.  The\n   classifiers\
    \ and traffic conditioners are set to reflect the policy\n   and traffic goals\
    \ for that domain and may be specified in a TCA\n   (Traffic Conditioning Agreement).\
    \  Once packets have crossed the DS\n   boundary, adherence to diffserv principles\
    \ makes it possible to group\n   packets solely according to the behavior they\
    \ receive at each hop (as\n   selected by the DSCP).  This approach has well-known\
    \ scaling\n   advantages, both in the forwarding path and in the control plane.\n\
    \   Less well recognized is that these scaling properties only result if\n   the\
    \ per-hop behavior definition gives rise to a particular type of\n   invariance\
    \ under aggregation.  Since the per-hop behavior must be\n   equivalent for every\
    \ node in the domain, while the set of packets\n   marked for that PHB may be\
    \ different at every node, PHBs should be\n   defined such that their characteristics\
    \ do not depend on the traffic\n   volume of the associated BA on a router's ingress\
    \ link nor on a\n   particular path through the DS domain taken by the packets.\n\
    \   Specifically, different streams of traffic that belong to the same\n   traffic\
    \ aggregate merge and split as they traverse the network.  If\n   the properties\
    \ of a PDB using a particular PHB hold regardless of how\n   the temporal characteristics\
    \ of the marked traffic aggregate change\n   as it traverses the domain, then\
    \ that PDB scales.  (Clearly this\n   assumes that numerical parameters such as\
    \ bandwidth allocated to the\n   particular PDB may be different at different\
    \ points in the network,\n   and may be adjusted dynamically as traffic volume\
    \ varies.)  If there\n   are limits to where the properties hold, that translates\
    \ to a limit\n   on the size or topology of a DS domain that can use that PDB.\n\
    \   Although useful single-link DS domains might exist, PDBs that are\n   invariant\
    \ with network size or that have simple relationships with\n   network size and\
    \ whose properties can be recovered by reapplying\n   rules (that is, forming\
    \ another diffserv boundary or edge to re-\n   enforce the rules for the traffic\
    \ aggregate) are needed for building\n   scalable end-to-end quality of service.\n\
    \   There is a clear distinction between the definition of a Per-Domain\n   Behavior\
    \ in a DS domain and a service that might be specified in a\n   Service Level\
    \ Agreement.  The PDB definition is a technical building\n   block that permits\
    \ the coupling of classifiers, traffic conditioners,\n   specific PHBs, and particular\
    \ configurations with a resulting set of\n   specific observable attributes which\
    \ may be characterized in a\n   variety of ways.  These definitions are intended\
    \ to be useful tools\n   in configuring DS domains, but the PDB (or PDBs) used\
    \ by a provider\n   is not expected to be visible to customers any more than the\
    \ specific\n   PHBs employed in the provider's network would be.  Network providers\n\
    \   are expected to select their own measures to make customer-visible in\n  \
    \ contracts and these may be stated quite differently from the\n   technical attributes\
    \ specified in a PDB definition, though the\n   configuration of a PDB might be\
    \ taken from a Service Level\n   Specification (SLS).  Similarly, specific PDBs\
    \ are intended as tools\n   for ISPs to construct differentiated services offerings;\
    \ each may\n   choose different sets of tools, or even develop their own, in order\n\
    \   to achieve particular externally observable metrics.  Nevertheless,\n   the\
    \ measurable parameters of a PDB are expected to be among the\n   parameters cited\
    \ directly or indirectly in the Service Level\n   Specification component of a\
    \ corresponding SLA.\n   This document defines Differentiated Services Per-Domain\
    \ Behaviors\n   and specifies the format that must be used for submissions of\n\
    \   particular PDBs to the Diffserv WG.\n"

  - "2 Definitions\n   The following definitions are stated in RFCs 2474 and 2475\
    \ and are\n   repeated here for easy reference:\n   \" Behavior Aggregate: a collection\
    \ of packets with the same codepoint\n     crossing a link in a particular direction.\n\
    \   \" Differentiated Services Domain: a contiguous portion of the\n     Internet\
    \ over which a consistent set of differentiated services\n     policies are administered\
    \ in a coordinated fashion.  A\n     differentiated services domain can represent\
    \ different\n     administrative domains or autonomous systems, different trust\n\
    \     regions, different network technologies (e.g., cell/frame), hosts\n    \
    \ and routers, etc.  Also DS domain.\n   \" Differentiated Services Boundary:\
    \ the edge of a DS domain, where\n     classifiers and traffic conditioners are\
    \ likely to be deployed.  A\n     differentiated services boundary can be further\
    \ sub-divided into\n     ingress and egress nodes, where the ingress/egress nodes\
    \ are the\n     downstream/upstream nodes of a boundary link in a given traffic\n\
    \     direction.  A differentiated services boundary typically is found\n    \
    \ at the ingress to the first-hop differentiated services-compliant\n     router\
    \ (or network node) that a host's packets traverse, or at the\n     egress of\
    \ the last-hop differentiated services-compliant router or\n     network node\
    \ that packets traverse before arriving at a host.  This\n     is sometimes referred\
    \ to as the boundary at a leaf router.  A\n     differentiated services boundary\
    \ may be co-located with a host,\n     subject to local policy.  Also DS boundary.\n\
    \   To these we add:\n   \" Traffic Aggregate: a collection of packets with a\
    \ codepoint that\n     maps to the same PHB, usually in a DS domain or some subset\
    \ of a DS\n     domain.  A traffic aggregate marked for the foo PHB is referred\
    \ to\n     as the \"foo traffic aggregate\" or \"foo aggregate\" interchangeably.\n\
    \     This generalizes the concept of Behavior Aggregate from a link to a\n  \
    \   network.\n   \" Per-Domain Behavior: the expected treatment that an identifiable\
    \ or\n     target group of packets will receive from \"edge-to-edge\" of a DS\n\
    \     domain.  (Also PDB.)  A particular PHB (or, if applicable, list of\n   \
    \  PHBs) and traffic conditioning requirements are associated with\n     each\
    \ PDB.\n   \" A Service Level Specification (SLS) is a set of parameters and\n\
    \     their values which together define the service offered to a traffic\n  \
    \   stream by a DS domain.  It is expected to include specific values\n     or\
    \ bounds for PDB parameters.\n"

  - "3 The Value of Defining Edge-to-Edge Behavior\n   As defined in section 2, a\
    \ PDB describes the edge-to-edge behavior\n   across a DS domain's \"cloud.\"\
    \ Specification of the transit\n   expectations of packets matching a target for\
    \ a particular diffserv\n   behavior across a DS domain will both assist in the\
    \ deployment of\n   single-domain QoS and will help enable the composition of\
    \ end-to-end,\n   cross-domain services.  Networks of DS domains can be connected\
    \ to\n   create end-to-end services by building on the PDB characteristics\n \
    \  without regard to the particular PHBs used.  This level of\n   abstraction\
    \ makes it easier to compose cross-domain services as well\n   as making it possible\
    \ to hide details of a network's internals while\n   exposing information sufficient\
    \ to enable QoS.\n   Today's Internet is composed of multiple independently administered\n\
    \   domains or Autonomous Systems (ASs), represented by the \"clouds\" in\n  \
    \ figure 1.  To deploy ubiquitous end-to-end quality of service in the\n   Internet,\
    \ business models must evolve that include issues of charging\n   and reporting\
    \ that are not in scope for the IETF.  In the meantime,\n   there are many possible\
    \ uses of quality of service within an AS and\n   the IETF can address the technical\
    \ issues in creating an intradomain\n   QoS within a Differentiated Services framework.\
    \  In fact, this\n   approach is quite amenable to incremental deployment strategies.\n\
    \   Where DS domains are independently administered, the evolution of the\n  \
    \ necessary business agreements and future signaling arrangements will\n   take\
    \ some time, thus, early deployments will be within a single\n   administrative\
    \ domain.  Putting aside the business issues, the same\n   technical issues that\
    \ arise in interconnecting DS domains with\n   homogeneous administration will\
    \ arise in interconnecting the\n   autonomous systems (ASs) of the Internet.\n\

    \         Figure 1: Interconnection of ASs and DS Domains\n   A single AS (e.g.,\
    \ AS2 in figure 1) may be composed of subnetworks\n   and, as the definition allows,\
    \ these can be separate DS domains.  An\n   AS might have multiple DS domains\
    \ for a number of reasons, most\n   notable being to follow topological and/or\
    \ technological boundaries\n   and to separate the allocation of resources.  If\
    \ we confine ourselves\n   to the DS boundaries between these \"interior\" DS\
    \ domains, we avoid\n   the non-technical problems of setting up a service and\
    \ can address\n   the issues of creating characterizable PDBs.\n   The incentive\
    \ structure for differentiated services is based on\n   upstream domains ensuring\
    \ their traffic conforms to the Traffic\n   Conditioning Agreements (TCAs) with\
    \ downstream domains and downstream\n   domains enforcing that TCA, thus metrics\
    \ associated with PDBs can be\n   sensibly computed.  The letters \"X\" and \"\
    Y\" in figure 1 represent the\n   DS boundary routers containing traffic conditioners\
    \ that ensure and\n   enforce conformance (e.g., shapers and policers).  Although\
    \ policers\n   and shapers are expected at the DS boundaries of ASs (the \"X\"\
    \ boxes),\n   they might appear anywhere, or nowhere, inside the AS.  Specifically,\n\
    \   the boxes at the DS boundaries internal to the AS (the \"Y\" boxes) may\n\
    \   or may not condition traffic.  Technical guidelines for the placement\n  \
    \ and configuration of DS boundaries should derive from the attributes\n   of\
    \ a particular PDB under aggregation and multiple hops.\n   This definition of\
    \ PDB continues the separation of forwarding path\n   and control plane described\
    \ in RFC 2474.  The forwarding path\n   characteristics are addressed by considering\
    \ how the behavior at\n   every hop of a packet's path is affected by the merging\
    \ and branching\n   of traffic aggregates through multiple hops.  Per-hop behaviors\
    \ in\n   nodes are configured infrequently, representing a change in network\n\
    \   infrastructure.  More frequent quality-of-service changes come from\n   employing\
    \ control plane functions in the configuration of the DS\n   boundaries.  A PDB\
    \ provides a link between the DS domain level at\n   which control is exercised\
    \ to form traffic aggregates with quality-\n   of-service goals across the domain\
    \ and the per-hop and per-link\n   treatments packets receive that results in\
    \ meeting the quality-of-\n   service goals.\n"

  - "4.1 Defining PDBs\n   RFCs 2474 and 2475 define a Differentiated Services Behavior\n\
    \   Aggregate as \"a collection of packets with the same DS codepoint\n   crossing\
    \ a link in a particular direction\" and further state that\n   packets with the\
    \ same DSCP get the same per-hop forwarding treatment\n   (or PHB) everywhere\
    \ inside a single DS domain.  Note that even if\n   multiple DSCPs map to the\
    \ same PHB, this must hold for each DSCP\n   individually.  In section 2 of this\
    \ document, we introduced a more\n   general definition of a traffic aggregate\
    \ in the diffserv sense so\n   that we might easily refer to the packets which\
    \ are mapped to the\n   same PHB everywhere within a DS domain.  Section 2 also\
    \ presented a\n   short definition of PDBs which we expand upon in this section:\n\
    \   Per-Domain Behavior: the expected treatment that an identifiable or\n    \
    \ target group of packets will receive from \"edge to edge\" of a DS\n     domain.\
    \  A particular PHB (or, if applicable, list of PHBs) and\n     traffic conditioning\
    \ requirements are associated with each PDB.\n   Each PDB has measurable, quantifiable,\
    \ attributes that can be used to\n   describe what happens to its packets as they\
    \ enter and cross the DS\n   domain.  These derive from the characteristics of\
    \ the traffic\n   aggregate that results from application of classification and\
    \ traffic\n   conditioning during the entry of packets into the DS domain and\
    \ the\n   forwarding treatment (PHB) the packets get inside the domain, but can\n\
    \   also depend on the entering traffic loads and the domain's topology.\n   PDB\
    \ attributes may be absolute or statistical and they may be\n   parameterized\
    \ by network properties.  For example, a loss attribute\n   might be expressed\
    \ as \"no more than 0.1% of packets will be dropped\n   when measured over any\
    \ time period larger than T\", a delay attribute\n   might be expressed as \"\
    50% of delivered packets will see less than a\n   delay of d milliseconds, 30%\
    \ will see a delay less than 2d ms, 20%\n   will see a delay of less than 3d ms.\"\
    \ A wide range of metrics is\n   possible.  In general they will be expressed\
    \ as bounds or percentiles\n   rather than as absolute values.\n   A PDB is applied\
    \ to a target group of packets arriving at the edge of\n   the DS domain.  The\
    \ target group is distinguished from all arriving\n   packets by use of packet\
    \ classifiers [RFC2475] (where the classifier\n   may be \"null\").  The action\
    \ of the PDB on the target group has two\n   parts.  The first part is the the\
    \ use of traffic conditioning to\n   create a traffic aggregate.  During traffic\
    \ conditioning, conformant\n   packets are marked with a DSCP for the PHB associated\
    \ with the PDB\n   (see figure 2).  The second part is the treatment experienced\
    \ by\n   packets from the same traffic aggregate transiting the interior of a\n\
    \   DS domain, between and inside of DS domain boundaries.  The following\n  \

    \ conditioners.  For example, if the EF PHB [RFC2598] and a\n   strict policer\
    \ of rate R are associated with the foo PDB, then the\n   first part of characterizing\
    \ the foo PDB is to write the relationship\n   between the arriving target packets\
    \ and the departing foo traffic\n   aggregate.  In this case, \"the rate of the\
    \ emerging foo traffic\n   aggregate is less than or equal to the smaller of R\
    \ and the arrival\n   rate of the target group of packets\" and additional temporal\n\
    \   characteristics of the packets (e.g., burst) may be specified as\n   desired.\
    \  Thus, there is a \"loss rate\" on the arriving target group\n   that results\
    \ from sending too much traffic or the traffic with the\n   wrong temporal characteristics.\
    \  This loss rate should be entirely\n   preventable (or controllable) by the\
    \ upstream sender conforming to\n   the traffic conditioning associated with the\
    \ PDB specification.\n   The issue of \"who is in control\" of the loss (or demotion)\
    \ rate helps\n   to clearly delineate this component of PDB performance from that\n\
    \   associated with transiting the domain.  The latter is completely\n   under\
    \ control of the operator of the DS domain and the former is used\n   to ensure\
    \ that the entering traffic aggregate conforms to the traffic\n   profile to which\
    \ the operator has provisioned the network.  Further,\n   the effects of traffic\
    \ conditioning on the target group can usually\n   be expressed more simply than\
    \ the effects of transiting the DS domain\n   on the traffic aggregate's traffic\
    \ profile.\n   A PDB may also apply traffic conditioning at DS domain egress.\
    \  The\n   effect of this conditioning on the overall PDB attributes would be\n\
    \   treated similarly to the ingress characteristics (the authors may\n   develop\
    \ more text on this in the future, but it does not materially\n   affect the ideas\

- title: 4.2 Constructing PDBs
  contents:
  - "4.2 Constructing PDBs\n   A DS domain is configured to meet the network operator's\
    \ traffic\n   engineering goals for the domain independently of the performance\n\
    \   goals for a particular flow of a traffic aggregate.  Once the\n   interior\
    \ routers are configured for the number of distinct traffic\n   aggregates that\
    \ the network will handle, each PDB's allocation at the\n   edge comes from meeting\
    \ the desired performance goals for the PDB's\n   traffic aggregate subject to\
    \ that configuration of packet schedulers\n   and bandwidth capacity.  The configuration\
    \ of traffic conditioners at\n   the edge may be altered by provisioning or admission\
    \ control but the\n   decision about which PDB to use and how to apply classification\
    \ and\n   traffic conditioning comes from matching performance to goals.\n   For\
    \ example, consider the DS domain of figure 3.  A PDB with an\n   explicit bound\
    \ on loss must apply traffic conditioning at the\n   boundary to ensure that on\
    \ the average no more packets are admitted\n   than can emerge.  Though, queueing\
    \ internal to the network may result\n   in a difference between input and output\
    \ traffic over some\n   timescales, the averaging timescale should not exceed\
    \ what might be\n   expected for reasonably sized buffering inside the network.\
    \  Thus if\n   bursts are allowed to arrive into the interior of the network,\
    \ there\n   must be enough capacity to ensure that losses don't exceed the bound.\n\
    \   Note that explicit bounds on the loss level can be particularly\n   difficult\
    \ as the exact way in which packets merge inside the network\n   affects the burstiness\
    \ of the PDB's traffic aggregate and hence,\n   loss.\n   PHBs give explicit expressions\
    \ of the treatment a traffic aggregate\n   can expect at each hop.  For a PDB,\
    \ this behavior must apply to\n   merging and diverging traffic aggregates, thus\
    \ characterizing a PDB\n   requires understanding what happens to a PHB under\
    \ aggregation.  That\n   is, PHBs recursively applied must result in a known behavior.\
    \  As an\n   example, since maximum burst sizes grow with the number of microflows\n\
    \   or traffic aggregate streams merged, a PDB specification must address\n  \
    \ this.  A clear advantage of constructing behaviors that aggregate is\n   the\
    \ ease of concatenating PDBs so that the associated traffic\n   aggregate has\
    \ known attributes that span interior DS domains and,\n   eventually, farther.\
    \  For example, in figure 1 assume that we have\n   configured the foo PDB on\
    \ the interior DS domains of AS2.  Then\n   traffic aggregates associated with\
    \ the foo PDB in each interior DS\n   domain of AS2 can be merged at the shaded\
    \ interior boundary routers.\n   If the same (or fewer) traffic conditioners as\
    \ applied at the\n   entrance to AS2 are applied at these interior boundaries,\
    \ the\n   attributes of the foo PDB should continue to be used to quantify the\n\
    \   expected behavior.  Explicit expressions of what happens to the\n   behavior\
    \ under aggregation, possibly parameterized by node in-degrees\n   or network\
    \ diameters, are necessary to determine what to do at the\n   internal aggregation\
    \ points.  One approach might be to completely\n   reapply the traffic conditioning\
    \ at these points; another might\n   employ some limited rate-based remarking\
    \ only.\n   Multiple PDBs may use the same PHB.  The specification of a PDB can\n\
    \   contain a list of PHBs and their required configuration, all of which\n  \
    \ would result in the same PDB.  In operation, it is expected that a\n   single\
    \ domain will use a single PHB to implement a particular PDB,\n   though different\
    \ domains may select different PHBs.  Recall that in\n   the diffserv definition\
    \ [RFC2474], a single PHB might be selected\n   within a domain by a list of DSCPs.\
    \  Multiple PDBs might use the same\n   PHB in which case the transit performance\
    \ of traffic aggregates of\n   these PDBs will, of necessity, be the same.  Yet,\
    \ the particular\n   characteristics that the PDB designer wishes to claim as\
    \ attributes\n   may vary, so two PDBs that use the same PHB might not be specified\n\
    \   with the same list of attributes.\n   The specification of the transit expectations\
    \ of PDBs across domains\n   both assists in the deployment of QoS within a DS\
    \ domain and helps\n   enable the composition of end-to-end, cross-domain services\
    \ to\n   proceed by making it possible to hide details of a domain's internals\n\
    \   while exposing characteristics necessary for QoS.\n"
- title: 4.3 PDBs using PHB Groups
  contents:
  - "4.3 PDBs using PHB Groups\n   The use of PHB groups to construct PDBs can be\
    \ done in several ways.\n   A single PHB member of a PHB group might be used to\
    \ construct a\n   single PDB.  For example, a PDB could be defined using just\
    \ one of\n   the Class Selector Compliant PHBs [RFC2474].  The traffic\n   conditioning\
    \ for that PDB and the required configuration of the\n   particular PHB would\
    \ be defined in such a way that there was no\n   dependence or relationship with\
    \ the manner in which other PHBs of the\n   group are used or, indeed, whether\
    \ they are used in that DS domain.\n   In this case, the reasonable approach would\
    \ be to specify this PDB\n   alone in a document which expressly called out the\
    \ conditions and\n   configuration of the Class Selector PHB required.\n   A single\
    \ PDB can be constructed using more than one PHB from the same\n   PHB group.\
    \  For example, the traffic conditioner described in RFC\n   2698 might be used\
    \ to mark a particular entering traffic aggregate\n   for one of the three AF1x\
    \ PHBs [RFC2597] while the transit\n   performance of the resultant PDB is specified,\
    \ statistically, across\n   all the packets marked with one of those PHBs.\n \
    \  A set of related PDBs might be defined using a PHB group.  In this\n   case,\
    \ the related PDBs should be defined in the same document.  This\n   is appropriate\
    \ when the traffic conditioners that create the traffic\n   aggregates associated\
    \ with each PDB have some relationships and\n   interdependencies such that the\
    \ traffic aggregates for these PDBs\n   should be described and characterized\
    \ together.  The transit\n   attributes will depend on the PHB associated with\
    \ the PDB and will\n   not be the same for all PHBs in the group, though there\
    \ may be some\n   parameterized interrelationship between the attributes of each\
    \ of\n   these PDBs.  In this case, each PDB should have a clearly separate\n\
    \   description of its transit attributes (delineated in a separate\n   subsection)\
    \ within the document.  For example, the traffic\n   conditioner described in\
    \ RFC 2698 might be used to mark arriving\n   packets for three different AF1x\
    \ PHBs, each of which is to be treated\n   as a separate traffic aggregate in\
    \ terms of transit properties.  Then\n   a single document could be used to define\
    \ and quantify the\n   relationship between the arriving packets and the emerging\
    \ traffic\n   aggregates as they relate to one another.  The transit\n   characteristics\
    \ of packets of each separate AF1x traffic aggregate\n   should be described separately\
    \ within the document.\n   Another way in which a PHB group might be used to create\
    \ one PDB per\n   PHB might have decoupled traffic conditioners, but some relationship\n\
    \   between the PHBs of the group.  For example, a set of PDBs might be\n   defined\
    \ using Class Selector Compliant PHBs [RFC2474] in such a way\n   that the traffic\
    \ conditioners that create the traffic aggregates are\n   not related, but the\
    \ transit performance of each traffic aggregate\n   has some parametric relationship\
    \ to the other.  If it makes sense to\n   specify them in the same document, then\
    \ the author(s) should do so.\n"

    \ for the construction of interdomain quality-of-\n   service, a PDB specification\
    \ should provide the answer to the\n   question: Under what conditions can we\
    \ join the output of this domain\n   to another under the same traffic conditioning\
    \ and expectations?\n   Although there are many ways in which traffic might be\
    \ distributed,\n   creating quantifiable, realizable PDBs that can be concatenated\
    \ into\n   multi-domain services limits the realistic scenarios.  A PDB's\n  \
    \ attributes with a clear statement of the conditions under which the\n   attributes\
    \ hold is critical to the composition of multi-domain\n   services.\n   There\
    \ is a clear correlation between the strictness of the traffic\n   conditioning\
    \ and the quality of the PDB's attributes.  As indicated\n   earlier, numerical\
    \ bounds are likely to be statistical or expressed\n   as a percentile.  Parameters\

    \ with respect to time.  First\n   are properties over \"long\" time periods,\
    \ or average behaviors.  A PDB\n   specification should report these as the rates\
    \ or throughput seen\n   over some specified time period.  In addition, there\
    \ are properties\n   of \"short\" time behavior, usually expressed as the allowable\n\
    \   burstiness in a traffic aggregate.  The short time behavior is\n   important\
    \ in understanding buffering requirements (and associated\n   loss characteristics)\
    \ and for metering and conditioning\n   considerations at DS boundaries.  For\
    \ short-time behavior, we are\n   interested primarily in two things: 1) how many\
    \ back-to-back packets\n   of the PDB's traffic aggregate will we see at any point\
    \ (this would\n   be metered as a burst) and 2) how large a burst of packets of\
    \ this\n   PDB's traffic aggregate can appear in a queue at once (gives queue\n\
    \   overflow and loss).  If other PDBs are using the same PHB within the\n   domain,\

  - "6.2 Considerations in specifying short-term or bursty PDB attributes\n   Next,\
    \ consider the short-time behavior of the traffic aggregate\n   associated with\
    \ a PDB, specifically whether permitting the maximum\n   bursts to add in the\
    \ same manner as the average rates will lead to\n   properties that aggregate\
    \ or under what conditions this will lead to\n   properties that aggregate.  In\
    \ our example, if domain D allows each\n   of the uplinks to burst p packets into\
    \ the foo traffic aggregate, the\n   bursts could accumulate as they transit the\
    \ ring.  Packets headed for\n   link L can come from both directions of the ring\
    \ and back-to-back\n   packets from foo's traffic aggregate can arrive at the\
    \ same time.  If\n   the bandwidth of link L is the same as the links of the ring,\
    \ this\n   probably does not present a buffering problem.  If there are two\n\
    \   input links that can send packets to queue for L, at worst, two\n   packets\
    \ can arrive simultaneously for L.  If the bandwidth of link L\n   equals or exceeds\
    \ twice B, the packets won't accumulate.  Further, if\n   p is limited to one,\
    \ and the bandwidth of L exceeds the rate of\n   arrival (over the longer term)\
    \ of foo packets (required for bounding\n   the loss) then the queue of foo packets\
    \ for link L will empty before\n   new packets arrive.  If the bandwidth of L\
    \ is equal to B, one foo\n   packet must queue while the other is transmitted.\
    \  This would result\n   in N x p back-to- back packets of this traffic aggregate\
    \ arriving\n   over L during the same time scale as the bursts of p were permitted\n\
    \   on the uplinks.  Thus, configuring the PDB so that link L can handle\n   the\
    \ sum of the rates that ingress to the foo PDB doesn't guarantee\n   that L can\
    \ handle the sum of the N bursts into the foo PDB.\n   If the bandwidth of L is\
    \ less than B, then the link must buffer\n   Nxpx(B-L)/B foo packets to avoid\
    \ loss.  If the PDB is getting less\n   than the full bandwidth L, this number\
    \ is larger.  For probabilistic\n   bounds, a smaller buffer might do if the probability\
    \ of exceeding it\n   can be bounded.\n   More generally, for router indegree\
    \ of d, bursts of foo packets might\n   arrive on each input.  Then, in the absence\
    \ of any additional traffic\n   conditioning, it is possible that dxpx(# of uplinks)\
    \ back-to-back foo\n   packets can be sent across link L to domain E.  Thus the\
    \ DS domain E\n   must permit these much larger bursts into the foo PDB than domain\
    \ D\n   permits on the N uplinks or else the foo traffic aggregate must be\n \
    \  made to conform to the TCA for entering E (e.g., by shaping).\n   What conditions\
    \ should be imposed on a PDB and on the associated PHB\n   in order to ensure\
    \ PDBs can be concatenated, as across the interior\n   DS domains of figure 1?\
    \  Traffic conditioning for constructing a PDB\n   that has certain attributes\
    \ across a DS domain should apply\n   independently of the origin of the packets.\
    \  With reference to the\n   example we've been exploring, the TCA for the PDB's\
    \ traffic aggregate\n   entering link L into domain E should not depend on the\
    \ number of\n   uplinks into domain D.\n"

    \ traffic\"\n   across a diffserv network.  That is, the definition and use of\
    \ this\n   PDB is to preserve, to a reasonable extent, the pre-diffserv delivery\n\
    \   expectation for packets in a diffserv network that do not require any\n  \
    \ special differentiation.  Although the PDB itself does not include\n   bounds\
    \ on availability, latency, and packet loss, this does not\n   preclude Service\
    \ Providers from engineering their networks so as to\n   result in commercially\
    \ viable bounds on services that utilize the BE\n   PDB.  This would be analogous\
    \ to the Service Level Guarantees that\n   are provided in today's single-service\
    \ Internet.\n   In the present single-service commercial Internet, Service Level\n\
    \   Guarantees for availability, latency, and packet delivery can be\n   found\
    \ on the web sites of ISPs [WCG, PSI, UU].  For example, a\n   typical North American\
    \ round-trip latency bound is 85 milliseconds,\n   with each service provider's\

  contents:
  - "8 Guidelines for writing PDB specifications\n   G1. Following the format given\
    \ in this document, write a draft and\n   submit it as an Internet Draft.  The\
    \ document should have \"diffserv\"\n   as some part of the name.  Either as an\
    \ appendix to the draft, or in\n   a separate document, provide details of deployment\
    \ experience with\n   measured results on a network of non-trivial size carrying\
    \ realistic\n   traffic and/or convincing simulation results (simulation of a\
    \ range\n   of modern traffic patterns and network topologies as applicable).\n\
    \   The document should be brought to the attention of the diffserv WG\n   mailing\
    \ list, if active.\n   G2. Initial discussion should focus primarily on the merits\
    \ of the\n   PDB, though comments and questions on the claimed attributes are\n\
    \   reasonable.  This is in line with the Differentiated Services goal to\n  \
    \ put relevance before academic interest in the specification of PDBs.\n   Academically\
    \ interesting PDBs are encouraged, but would be more\n   appropriate for technical\
    \ publications and conferences, not for\n   submission to the IETF.  (An \"academically\
    \ interesting\" PDB might\n   become a PDB of interest for deployment over time.)\n\
    \   The implementation of the following guidelines varies, depending on\n   whether\
    \ there is an active diffserv working group or not.\n   Active Diffserv Working\
    \ Group path:\n   G3. Once consensus has been reached on a version of a draft\
    \ that it\n   is a useful PDB and that the characteristics \"appear\" to be correct\n\
    \   (i.e., not egregiously wrong) that version of the draft goes to a\n   review\
    \ panel the WG co-chairs set up to audit and report on the\n   characteristics.\
    \  The review panel will be given a deadline for the\n   review.  The exact timing\
    \ of the deadline will be set on a case-by-\n   case basis by the co-chairs to\
    \ reflect the complexity of the task and\n   other constraints (IETF meetings,\
    \ major holidays) but is expected to\n   be in the 4-8 week range.  During that\
    \ time, the panel may correspond\n   with the authors directly (cc'ing the WG\
    \ co-chairs) to get\n   clarifications.  This process should result in a revised\
    \ draft and/or\n   a report to the WG from the panel that either endorses or disputes\n\
    \   the claimed characteristics.\n   G4. If/when endorsed by the panel, that draft\
    \ goes to WG last call.\n   If not endorsed, the author(s) can give an itemized\
    \ response to the\n   panel's report and ask for a WG Last Call.\n   G5. If/when\
    \ passes Last Call, goes to ADs for publication as a WG\n   Informational RFC\
    \ in our \"PDB series\".\n   If no active Diffserv Working Group exists:\n   G3.\
    \ Following discussion on relevant mailing lists, the authors\n   should revise\
    \ the Internet Draft and contact the IESG for \"Expert\n   Review\" as defined\
    \ in section 2 of RFC 2434 [RFC2434].\n   G4. Subsequent to the review, the IESG\
    \ may recommend publication of\n   the Draft as an RFC, request revisions, or\
    \ decline to publish as an\n   Informational RFC in the \"PDB series\".\n"
