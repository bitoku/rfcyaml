  - "Overview\n   The Energy Sciences Network (ESnet) is a nation-wide computer data\n\
    \   communications network managed and funded by the United States\n   Department\
    \ of Energy, Office of Energy Research (U.S. DOE/OER), for\n   the purpose of\
    \ supporting multiple program, open scientific research.\n   ESnet is intended\
    \ to facilitate remote access to major Energy\n   Research (ER) scientific facilities,\
    \ provide needed information\n   dissemination among scientific collaborators\
    \ throughout all ER\n   programs, and provide widespread access to existing ER\
    \ supercomputer\n   facilities.\n   Coordination of ER-wide network-related technical\
    \ activities over the\n   ESnet backbone is achieved through the ESnet Site Coordinating\n\
    \   Committee (ESCC). This committee is comprised of one technical\n   contact\
    \ person from each backbone site, as well as some members of\n   the ESnet management\
    \ and networking staff.  As the need for new\n   levels of ESnet services arise,\
    \ the ESCC typically creates task\n   forces to investigate and research issues\
    \ relating to these new\n   services.  Each task force usually results in a whitepaper\
    \ which\n   makes recommendations to the ESnet community on how these services\n\
    \   should be deployed to meet the mission of DOE/OER.\n   This RFC is a near\
    \ verbatim copy of the whitepaper produced by the\n   ESnet Site Coordinating\
    \ Committee's X.500/X.400 Task Force.\n"

  - "1.1.  Abstract and Introduction\n   This document recommends an initial approach\
    \ for the Phase I\n   deployment of OSI Directory Services (X.500) and OSI Message\
    \ Handling\n   Services (X.400) within the ESnet community.  It is anticipated\
    \ that\n   directly connected ESnet backbone sites will participate and follow\n\
    \   the suggestions set forth in this document.\n   Section 7 of the \"ESnet Program\
    \ Plan\" (DOE/OER-0486T, dated March\n   1991) cites the need for further research\
    \ and investigation in the\n   areas of electronic mail and directory services.\
    \  The ESCC\n   X.500/X.400 Task Force was created to address this need.\n   Additionally,\
    \ the task force is addressing the issues of a\n   coordinated, interoperable\
    \ deployment of OSI Directory Services and\n   OSI Message Handling within the\
    \ entire ESnet community.  Since only a\n   small subset of this community is\
    \ actively pursuing these avenues,\n   considerable effort must be made to establish\
    \ the necessary \"base\" to\n   build upon.  If directly connected ESnet sites\
    \ participate in these\n   services, a consistent transition path will be ensured\
    \ and the\n   services provided will be mutually valuable and useful.\n   X.500\
    \ and X.400 are continuously evolving standards, and are\n   typically updated\
    \ every four years.  U.S. GOSIP (Government OSI\n   Profile) Requirements are\
    \ updated to define additional functionality\n   as needed by the U.S. Federal\
    \ Government, usually every two years.\n   As the X.500 and X.400 standards evolve\
    \ and U.S. GOSIP Requirements\n   are extended, consideration must be given as\
    \ to the effect this may\n   have on these existing services in the ESnet community.\
    \  At these\n   cross-roads, or when a sizeable increase in service functionality\
    \ is\n   desired, another \"phase of deployment\" may be in order.  In this\n\
    \   sense, there isn't a specific \"final phase\" goal, but rather several\n \
    \  new releases (updates) to the level of existing services.\n"

- title: 2.1.  Brief Tutorial
  contents:
  - "2.1.  Brief Tutorial\n   X.500 is a CCITT/ISO standard which defines a global\
    \ solution for the\n   distribution and retrieval of information (directory service).\
    \  The\n   X.500 standard includes the following characteristics:  decentralized\n\
    \   management, powerful searching capabilities, a single global\n   namespace,\
    \ and a structured framework for the storage of information.\n   The 1988 version\
    \ of the X.500 standard specifies four models to\n   define the Directory Service:\
    \ the Information Model, the Functional\n   Model, the Organizational Model and\
    \ the Security Model.  As is the\n   nature of International standards, work continues\
    \ on the 1992 X.500\n   standard agreements.\n   The Information Model specifies\
    \ how information is defined in the\n   directory.  The Directory holds information\
    \ objects, which contain\n   information about \"interesting\" objects in the\
    \ real-world.  These\n   objects are modeled as entries in an information base,\
    \ the Directory\n   Information Base (DIB).  Each entry contains information about\
    \ one\n   object:  ie, a person, a network, or an organization.  An entry is\n\
    \   constructed from a set of attributes each of which holds a single\n   piece\
    \ of information about the object.  For example, to build an\n   entry for a person\
    \ the attributes might include \"surname\",\n   \"telephoneNumber\", \"postalAddress\"\
    , \"rfc822Mailbox\" (SMTP mail\n   address), \"mhsORAddresses\" (X.400 mail address)\
    \ and\n   \"facsimileTelephoneNumber\".  Each attribute has an attribute syntax\n\
    \   which describes the data that the attribute contains, for example, an\n  \
    \ alphanumeric string or photo data.  The OSI Directory is extensible\n   in that\
    \ it defines several common types of objects and attributes and\n   allows the\
    \ definition of new ones as new applications are developed\n   that make use of\
    \ the Directory.  Directory entries are arranged in a\n   hierarchical structure,\
    \ the Directory Information Tree (DIT).  It is\n   this structure which is used\
    \ to uniquely name entries.  The name of\n   an entry is its Distinguished Name\
    \ (DN).  It is formed by taking the\n   DN of the parent's entry, and adding the\
    \ the Relative Distinguished\n   Name (RDN) of the entry.  Along the path, the\
    \ RDNs are collected,\n   each naming an arc in the path.  Therefore, a DN for\
    \ an entry is\n   built by tracing the path from the root of the DIT to the entry.\n\
    \   The Functional Model defines how the information is stored in the\n   directory,\
    \ and how users access the information.  There are two\n   components of this\
    \ model:  the Directory User Agent (DUA), an\n   application-process which interacts\
    \ with the Directory on behalf of\n   the user, and the Directory System Agent\
    \ (DSA), which holds a\n   particular subset of the Directory Information Tree\
    \ and provides an\n   access point to the Directory for a DUA.\n   The Organizational\
    \ Model of the OSI Directory describes the service\n   in terms of the policy\
    \ defined between entities and the information\n   they hold.  The model defines\
    \ how portions of the DIT map onto DSAs.\n   A Directory Management Domain (DMD)\
    \ consists of one or more DSAs,\n   which collectively hold and manage a portion\
    \ of the DIT.\n   The Security Model defines two types of security for Directory\
    \ data:\n   Simple Authentication (using passwords) and Strong Authentication\n\
    \   (using cryptographic keys).  Authentication techniques are invoked\n   when\
    \ a user or process attempts a Directory operation through a DUA.\n"

  - "2.2.  Participation in the PSI White Pages Pilot Project\n   The PSI White Pages\
    \ Pilot Project is currently the most well-\n   established X.500 pilot project\
    \ within the United States.  For the\n   country=US portion of the DIT, PSI currently\
    \ has over 80 organization\n   names registered.  Of these, several are ESnet-related.\n\
    \   The PSI White Pages Pilot Project is also connected to the Pilot\n   International\
    \ Directory Service, PARADISE.  This pilot project\n   interconnects X.500 Directory\
    \ Services between Australia, Austria,\n   Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland,\
    \ France, Germany, Greece, Iceland,\n   Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg,\
    \ Netherlands, New Zealand,\n   Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland,\
    \ United Kingdom and\n   Yugoslavia.  The combined totals for all of these countries\n\
    \   (including the United States) as of December 1991 are:\n                 \
    \      DSAs:                     301\n                       Organizations:  \
    \        2,132\n                       White Pages Entries:  581,104\n   Considering\
    \ the large degree of national, and international,\n   connectivity within the\
    \ PSI White Pages Pilot Project, it is\n   recommended that directly connected\
    \ ESnet backbone sites join this\n   pilot project.\n"
- title: 2.3.  Recommended X.500 Implementation
  contents:
  - "2.3.  Recommended X.500 Implementation\n   Interoperability testing has not been\
    \ performed on most X.500\n   implementations.  Further, some X.500 functions\
    \ are not mature\n   standards and are often added by implementors as noninteroperable\n\
    \   extensions.\n   To ensure interoperability for the entire ESnet community,\
    \ the\n   University College London's publicly available X.500 implementation\n\
    \   (QUIPU) is recommended.  This product is known to run on several\n   UNIX-derivative\
    \ platforms, operates over CLNS and RFC-1006 (with\n   RFC-1006 being the currently\
    \ recommended stack), and is currently in\n   wide-spread use around the United\
    \ States and Europe, including\n   several ESnet backbone sites.\n   Appendix\
    \ C contains information on how to obtain QUIPU.\n   A later phase deployment\
    \ of X.500 services within the ESnet community\n   will recommend products (either\
    \ commercial or public domain) which\n   pass conformance and interoperability\
    \ tests.\n"
- title: 2.4.  Naming Structure
  contents:
  - "2.4.  Naming Structure\n   As participants in the PSI White Pages Pilot Project,\
    \ ESnet backbone\n   sites will align with the naming structure used by the Pilot.\
    \  This\n   structure is based upon a naming scheme for the US portion of the\
    \ DIT\n   developed by the North American Directory Forum (NADF) and documented\n\
    \   in RFC-1255.  Using this scheme, an organization with national\n   standing\
    \ would be listed directly under the US node in the global\n   DIT.  Organizations\
    \ chartered by the U.S. Congress as well as\n   organizations who have alphanumeric\
    \ nameforms registered with ANSI\n   are said to have national standing.  Therefore,\
    \ a backbone site which\n   is a national laboratory would be listed under country=US:\n\
    \              @c=US@o=Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory\n   As would a site\
    \ with an ANSI-registered organization name:\n           @c=US@o=National Energy\

    \ Directory Forum (NADF) is comprised of commercial\n   vendors positioning themselves\
    \ to offer commercial X.500 Directory\n   Services.  The NADF has produced several\
    \ documents since its\n   formation.  The ones of notable interest are those which\
    \ define the\n   structure and naming rules for the commercially operated DIT\
    \ under\n   country=US.  Specifically, for an Organization to exist directly\n\
    \   under c=US, it must be an organization with national-standing.  From\n   pages\
    \ 12-13 of RFC-1255, national-standing is defined in the\n   following way:\n\
    \      \"An organization is said to have national-standing if it is\n      chartered\
    \ (created and named) by the U.S. Congress.  An example\n      of such an organization\
    \ might be a national laboratory.  There\n      is no other entity which is empowered\
    \ by government to confer\n      national-standing on organizations.  However,\
    \ ANSI maintains an\n      alphanumeric nameform registration of organizations,\

    \   conferring national-standing on private organizations.\"\n   Thus, it appears\
    \ that National Laboratories (e.g. LBL, LLNL) are\n   considered organizations\
    \ with national-standing.  However, those\n   ESnet backbone sites which are not\
    \ National Laboratories may wish to\n   register with ANSI to have their organization\
    \ list directly under\n   c=US, but only if this is what they desire.  It is important\
    \ to note\n   that NADF is not a registration authority, but a group of service\n\
    \   providers defining a set of rules for information sharing and mutual\n   interoperability\
    \ in a commercial environment.\n   For further information on registering with\

  - "2.4.2.  Universities and Commercial Entities\n   Several of the ESnet backbone\
    \ sites are not National Laboratories\n   (e.g. CIT, FSU, GA, ISU, MIT, NYU, UCLA\
    \ and UTA).  Typically, at\n   these sites, a small collection of researchers\
    \ are involved in\n   performing DOE/OER funded research.  Thus, this set of researchers\
    \ at\n   a given site may not adequately represent the total X.500 community\n\
    \   at their facility. Additionally, ESnet Site Coordinators at these\n   facilities\
    \ may not be authorized to act as the Name Registration\n   Official for their\
    \ site.  So the question is, how do these sites\n   participate in the recommended\
    \ Phase I deployment of ESnet X.500\n   services.  There are two possible solutions\
    \ for this dilemma:\n   1.  If the site is not currently operating an X.500 DSA,\
    \ the ESnet\n       Site Coordinator may be able to establish and administer a\n\
    \       DSA to master the DOE/OER portion of the site's local DIT,\n       e.g.\
    \ \"@c=US@st=<st>@o=<site>@ou=Physics\".  Before attempting\n       this action,\
    \ it would be prudent for the Site Coordinator to\n       notify or seek approval\
    \ from some responsible entity.  At such\n       time that the site wishes to\
    \ manage its own organization\n       within the X.500 DIT, the ESnet Site Coordinator\
    \ would have to\n       make arrangements to put option 2 into effect.\n   2.\
    \  If the site is currently operating an X.500 DSA, the ESnet\n       Site Coordinator\
    \ may be able to work out an agreement with the\n       current DSA administrator\
    \ to administer a portion of the\n       site's local DIT which would represent\
    \ the DOE/OER community\n       at that site.  For example, if the site were already\n\
    \       administering the organization \"@c=US@st=\n       Massachusetts@o=Massachusetts\
    \ Institute of Technology\", the\n       ESnet Site Coordinator might then be\
    \ able to administer the\n       organizational unit \"@c=US@st=Massachusetts@o=Massachusetts\n\

    \   To try out some of the X.500 User Agents, simply TELNET to WP.ES.NET\n   and\
    \ login as user \"fred\"; no password is required.  You have the\n   choice of\
    \ running the Fred or Pod User Agents.  Fred provides a\n   command line interface\
    \ while Pod provides an X-windows based\n   interface.  You can browse through\

- title: 3.1.  Brief Tutorial
  contents:
  - "3.1.  Brief Tutorial\n   In 1984 CCITT defined a set of protocols for the exchange\
    \ of\n   electronic messages called Message Handling Systems (MHS) and is\n  \
    \ described in their X.400 series of recommendations.  ISO incorporated\n   these\
    \ recommendations in their standards (ISO 10021).  The name used\n   by ISO for\
    \ their system was MOTIS (Message-Oriented Text Interchange\n   Systems).  In\
    \ 1988 CCITT worked to align their X.400 recommendations\n   with ISO 10021. \
    \ Currently when people discuss messaging systems they\n   use the term X.400.\
    \  These two systems are designed for the general\n   purpose of exchanging electronic\
    \ messages in a store and forward\n   environment.  The principle use being made\
    \ of this system today is to\n   support electronic mail.  This section will give\
    \ an overview of X.400\n   as used for electronic mail.  In the following sections,\
    \ the term\n   X.400 will be used to describe both the X.400 and MOTIS systems.\n\
    \   The basic model used by X.400 MHS is that of a Message Transfer\n   System\
    \ (MTS) accessed via a User Agent (UA).  A UA is an application\n   that interacts\
    \ with the Message Transfer System to submit messages on\n   behalf of a user.\
    \  A user is referred to as either an Originator\n   (when sending a message)\
    \ or a Recipient (when receiving one).  The\n   process starts out when an Originator\
    \ prepares a message with the\n   assistance of their UA.  The UA then submits\
    \ the message to the MTS\n   for delivery.  The MTS then delivers the message\
    \ to one or more\n   Recipient UAs.\n                    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _\
    \ _ _ _ _ _ _ _\n       ______      |      _______          _______     |    \
    \ ______\n      |      |     | MTS |       |        |       |    |    |      |\n\
    \      |  UA  |<----|---->|  MTA  |<------>|  MTA  |<---|--->|  UA  |\n      |______|\
    \     |     |_______|        |_______|    |    |______|\n                   |_\
    \ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _|\n   The MTS provides the general store-and-forward\
    \ message transfer\n   service. It is made up of a number of distributed Message\
    \ Transfer\n   Agents (MTA).  Operating together, the MTAs relay the messages\
    \ and\n   deliver them to the intended recipient UAs, which then makes the\n \
    \  messages available to the recipient (user).\n   The basic structure of an X.400\
    \ message is an envelope and content\n   (i.e.  message).  The envelope carries\
    \ information to be used when\n   transferring the message through the MTS.  The\
    \ content is the piece\n   of information that the originating UA wishes delivered\
    \ to the\n   recipient UA.  There are a number of content types that can be\n\
    \   carried in X.400 envelopes.  The standard user message content type\n   defined\
    \ by X.400 is called the Interpersonal (IP) message.  An IP\n   message consists\
    \ of two parts, the heading and body.  The heading\n   contains the message control\
    \ information. The body contains the user\n   message.  The body may consist of\
    \ a number of different body parts.\n   For example one IP message could carry\
    \ voice, text, Telex and\n   facsimile body parts.\n   The Management domain (MD)\
    \ concept within the X.400 recommendations\n   defines the ownership, operational\
    \ and control boundary of an X.400\n   administration.  The collection consisting\
    \ of at least one MTA and\n   zero or more UAs owned by an organization or public\
    \ provider\n   constitutes a management domain (MD).  If the MD is managed by\
    \ a\n   public provider it is called an Administration Management Domain\n   (ADMD).\
    \  The MD managed by a company or organization is called a\n   Private Management\
    \ Domain (PRMD).  A Private MD is considered to\n   exist entirely within one\
    \ country.  Within that country a PRMD may\n   have access to one or more ADMDs.\n\
    \   Each MD must ensure that every user (i.e UA) in the MD has at least\n   one\
    \ name.  This name is called the Originator/Recipient (O/R) Name.\n   O/R Names\
    \ are constructed from a set of standard attributes:\n   o  Country Name\n   o\
    \  Administration Management Domain\n   o  Private Management Domain\n   o  Organization\
    \ Name\n   o  Organizational Unit Name\n   o  Surname\n   o  Given name\n   o\
    \  Initials\n   o  Generational Qualifier\n   An O/R name must locate one unambiguous\
    \ O/R UA if the message is to\n   be routed correctly through the Message Transfer\
    \ Service.  Currently\n   each MD along the route a message takes determines the\
    \ next MD's MTA\n   to which the message should be transferred.  No attempt is\
    \ made to\n   establish the full route for a message, either in the originating\
    \ MD\n   or in any other MD that acquires the store and forward responsibility\n\
    \   for the message.\n   Messages are relayed by each MD on the basis of the Management\
    \ domain\n   portion of their O/R Name until arrival at the recipient MD.  At\n\
    \   which point, the other attributes in the name are used to further\n   route\
    \ to the recipient UA.  Internal routing within a MD is the\n   responsibility\
    \ of each MD.\n"

  contents:
  - "3.2.  ESnet X.400 Logical Backbone\n   Currently within the ESnet community message\
    \ handling services are\n   implemented with a number of different mail products,\

    \ example,\n   let's say that LLNL only uses QuickMail on site, PPPL only uses\n\
    \   MAIL-11 (VMS MAIL), and CEBAF only uses SMTP mail.  For LLNL to send\n   mail\

    \ for PPPL to send mail to LLNL and CEBAF, it must\n   support MAIL-11 and QuickMail\
    \ locally.  Identically, this scenario\n   exists for CEBAF.\n   To alleviate\
    \ this problem, a logical X.400 backbone must be\n   established through out the\

- title: 3.4.  X.400 Routing
  contents:
  - "3.4.  X.400 Routing\n   In the IP environment a SMTP MTA could use the Domain\
    \ Name Service\n   (DNS) to locate connection information for the host closest\
    \ to the\n   recipient.  With X.400, MTAs must know the remote MTAs name and\n\
    \   password along with connection information.  This is because of\n   access\
    \ control requirements on some X.400 systems.  In X.400 MHS this\n   information\
    \ will, at some future date, be provided by X.500.  In the\n   mean time the routing\
    \ and connection process within the X.400\n   community is table driven.  This\
    \ solution requires a coordination and\n   distribution effort to ensure a quick\
    \ and reliable update of these\n   tables.\n   The current thinking on the problem\
    \ of X.400 routing is to decompose\n   the X.400 address space into a hierarchy,\
    \ with each node in this\n   hierarchy representing the entry point for an X.400\
    \ domain.  These\n   nodes have been commonly called Well Known Entry Points (WEPs).\
    \  Each\n   of these WEPs represent one X.400 MHS domain.  For example:\n    \
    \  /O=LBL/PRMD=ESnet/ADMD= /C=US/\n      /O=NERSC/PRMD=ESnet/ADMD= /C=US/\n  \
    \    /PRMD=ESnet/ADMD= /C=US/\n      /PRMD=ANL/ADMD= /C=US/\n      /PRMD=PNL/ADMD=\
    \ /C=US/\n   To minimize the number of hops between Originators and Recipients\
    \ it\n   is the current recommendation of the X.400 community that every PRMD\n\
    \   peer with all other PRMDs.\n   The ESnet backbone will provide connectivity\
    \ between multiple PRMDs\n   (the ESnet PRMD and any site operated PRMDs), each\
    \ with associated\n   well-know entry point MTAs.  Each of these PRMD-level MTAs\
    \ must be\n   configured with routing and mapping information about each other\
    \ to\n   enable peer-to-peer PRMD routing.  These routing tables should be\n \
    \  updated immediately upon the discovery of new/changed X.400\n   connectivity\
    \ information.  These tables will be made available to the\n   ESnet community\
    \ via the ESnet Information Server.  Once placed on-\n   line, a notification\
    \ message announcing the availability of this new\n   routing information will\
    \ be sent to every WEP owner via the E-mail\n   mechanism described in Section\
    \ 3.5.1.  It is recommended that WEP\n   administrators should retrieve this new\
    \ routing information and\n   update their MTAs within 10 working days.\n   The\
    \ well-known entry point MTA for each PRMD can route down to an\n   Organizational\
    \ level MTA or laterally to the well-known entry point\n   of a peer PRMD MTA.\n\
    \   For example, the ESnet MTA would route a message with the address:\n     \
    \          /PN=Funk/OU=CS/O=PPPL/PRMD=ESnet/ADMD= /C=US/\n   to a well-known entry\
    \ point for PPPL (O=PPPL).  PPPL must own and\n   operate their own X.400 MTA,\
    \ and it must be configured to accept\n   X.400 messages from the ESnet MTA. \
    \ Thus, the interpretation of\n   remaining \"/PN=Funk/OU=CS\" is left to the\
    \ PPPL MTA to route.\n   Mail sent from PPPL's MTA would be routed to the ESnet's\
    \ MTA (PRMD)\n   to be eventually routed to its destination.\n   The ESnet MTA\
    \ will also route to peer MTAs which are well-known entry\n   points for other\
    \ PRMDs (e.g. ESnet backbone site PRMDs, XNREN, Hughes\n   Air Craft, NASA, CDC).\
    \  For example, the ESnet MTA would route a\n   message with the address:\n  \
    \              /PN=Smith/OU=MS/O=RL/PRMD=PNL/ADMD= /C=US/\n   to a well-known\
    \ entry point for PNL (PRMD=PNL).  PNL must own and\n   operate their own X.400\
    \ MTA, and it must be configured to accept\n   X.400 messages from the ESnet MTA\
    \ (as well as possibly other PRMDs).\n   Thus, the interpretation of the remaining\
    \ \"/PN=SMITH/OU=MS/O=RL\" is\n   left to the PNL MTA to route.\n   Mail sent\
    \ from PNL's MTA (PRMD) would be routed to the well-known\n   entry point for\
    \ the PRMD indicated in the destination address.\n   Additionally, a site operated\
    \ PRMD must be able to route mail to any\n   other peer-PRMD within the ESnet\
    \ community.\n"

    \ with another PRMD or ADMD to\n   relay messages to a Management Domain that\

    \ PRMDs support downgrading of\n   X.400 1988 to X.400 1984.  Also, the PRMD must\
    \ be reachable from the\n   Internet Mail service.  This means the PRMD must maintain\

    \ certain information objects\n   (e.g., people, information processing systems\
    \ and applications) must\n   be unambiguously identifiable on a global basis.\
    \  These objects may\n   be defined by a variety of organizations, e.g., ISO/IEC,\
    \ CCITT,\n   commercial, and government.\n   To meet this requirement ISO/IEC\
    \ and CCITT have established a\n   hierarchical structure of names (a tree). \
    \ The top level of the\n   naming tree, shared by ISO and CCITT, represents the\
    \ global naming-\n   domain.  Naming domains are managed by registration authorities.\
    \  A\n   registration authority can delegate authority for part of its\n   naming-domain\
    \ to another (lower level) registration authority, thus\n   forming the tree.\n\
    \   Each object can be given a unique and unambiguous name by registering\n  \
    \ the object's name with an OSI registration authority at an\n   appropriate level\
    \ in the naming tree.\n   OSI name registration authorities and their procedures\
    \ are expected\n   to change over time.  Since names are intended to be stable,\
    \ these\n   changes (hopefully!) will have minimal impact on existing OSI name\n\

- title: 4.1.  Registration Authorities
  contents:
  - "4.1.  Registration Authorities\n   OSI names are obtained through OSI name registration\
    \ authorities by a\n   registration process.  The selection of which particular\
    \ registration\n   authority to use is determined by the desired level of the\
    \ OSI name\n   in the naming hierarchy, possible restrictions on the names allocated\n\
    \   by each registration authority, and the applicability rules (will\n   they\
    \ service your request) of each registration authority.\n   An OSI name registration\
    \ authority allocates OSI names from the\n   particular naming-domain it controls.\
    \  Every registration authority\n   can trace its naming authority to its parent\
    \ registration authority,\n   and ultimately to the top (global) level of the\
    \ naming hierarchy.\n"
- title: 4.2.  Registration Versus Notification
  contents:
  - "4.2.  Registration Versus Notification\n   Registering an OSI name guarantees\
    \ its uniqueness and lack of\n   ambiguity. For a name to be useful however, other\
    \ parties (besides\n   the registration authority) will need to be notified of\
    \ the name and\n   its usage.\n   There is a clear distinction between registration\
    \ (obtaining an OSI\n   name) and notification (informing others of a name and\
    \ its use).\n   Often the term \"registration\" is used to describe both activities,\n\
    \   this is a potential source of confusion.\n   For example, NADF and PSI (see\
    \ Section 2) are not OSI registration\n   authorities.  NADF may operate state\
    \ registration authorities in the\n   future, if delegated that administrative\
    \ right by the states.  PSI\n   operates an X.500 pilot project and needs to be\
    \ notified of\n   registered names when organizations join their pilot.\n   X.400\
    \ ADMD operators are also not OSI registration authorities,\n   although they\
    \ accept notification of X.400 PRMD names used by their\n   customers.\n   The\
    \ PTO is not an OSI registration authority.  PTO names have no\n   meaning in\
    \ an OSI context.\n"
- title: 4.3.  Sources of Nationally Unique Name Registration
  contents:
  - "4.3.  Sources of Nationally Unique Name Registration\n   There are four potential\
    \ sources of nationally unique names which are\n   of interest to the ESnet community.\
    \  These are ANSI, GSA, U.S. DOE\n   and the states.  An overview of the ANSI,\
    \ GSA, and U.S. DOE\n   procedures are given in later sections.\n   In order to\
    \ maintain national uniqueness \"constructed name syntax\" is\n   used by GSA,\
    \ U.S. DOE, and the states.  The form of each name is\n   shown below, \"name\"\
    \ is the name presented to the registration\n   authority for registration.\n\
    \   1.  ANSI names are of the form \"name\".\n   2.  GSA names are of the form\
    \ \"GOV+name\".\n   3.  U.S. DOE names are of the form \"GOV+USDOE+name\".\n \
    \  4.  State names are of the form \"CA+name\" (using California).\n   State name\
    \ registration authorities are not in operation at this\n   time.  The use of\
    \ U.S. DOE as a nationally unique name registration\n   source is not recommended\

    \ the technical framework for a\n   Directory Service infrastructure on the Internet.\
    \  This\n   infrastructure should be based on the OSI Directory (X.500).  It is\n\
    \   intended that this infrastructure can be used by many applications.\n   Whilst\

    \          are here)\n                   FOX (Field Operational X.500 Project)\n\
    \   The FOX project is a DARPA funded effort to provide a basis for\n   operational\
    \ X.500 deployment in the NREN/Internet.  This work is\n   being carried out at\
    \ Merit, NYSERnet/PSI, SRI and ISI.  ISI is the\n   main contractor and responsible\
    \ for project oversight.\n   There are two primary thrusts of the FOX project:\n\
    \   1.  X.500 Infrastructure:  It is important that multiple\n       interoperable\
    \ platforms be available for deployment.  FOX\n       plans to examine and test\
    \ the interoperability of the QUIPU\n       and NIST-X.500 (Custos) implementations,\
    \ and DNANS-X.500 if\n       possible.  In addition, FOX will explore X.500 interfaces\
    \ to\n       conventional database systems (one target is Sybase), an\n      \
    \ alternate OS platform (VM) for X.500 servers, and X-window\n       based user\
    \ interfaces.\n   2.  X.500 Applications:  A long-range goal is to facilitate\
    \ the\n       use of X.500 for real Internet applications.  FOX will first\n \
    \      focus on making network infrastructure information available\n       through\
    \ X.500.  This includes network and AS site contacts,\n       topology information,\
    \ and the NIC WHOIS service.\n   A centrally managed X.500 version will be the\
    \ first phase of a WHOIS\n   service.  Providing an X.500 version of a well-known\
    \ widely-used\n   service should promote the use of X.500 by Internet users. \
    \ In\n   addition, this effort will provide experience in designing X.500\n  \
    \ applications.  However, the manageability of this scheme will be\n   short-lived,\
    \ so the next step will be a design for a distributed\n   version of WHOIS.\n\
    \   Finally, it is critical for Internet X.500 efforts to be aligned with\n  \
    \ directory service efforts that are ongoing in other communities.  FOX\n   participants\
    \ are involved in, or are otherwise tracking these\n   efforts, and information\
    \ about FOX activities will be publicly\n   available.\n                   NADF\
    \ (North American Directory Forum)\n   The North American Directory Forum (NADF)\
    \ is a collection of\n   organizations which offer, or plan to offer, public Directory\n\
    \   services in North America, based on the CCITT X.500 Recommendations.\n   The\
    \ NADF has produced a document, NADF-175, \"A Naming Scheme for\n   c=US\", which\
    \ has been issued as RFC-1255.\n   The NADF-175 document proposes the use of existing\
    \ civil\n   infrastructure for naming objects under c=US.  This has the advantage\n\
    \   of using existing registration authorities and not establishing any\n   new\
    \ ones (the document simply maps names assigned by existing\n   authorities into\
    \ different portions of the c=US DIT).  The document\n   is intended as the basis\
    \ for X.500 names in the U.S. for the long-\n   term; it is important that interested\
    \ parties get a copy, review it,\n   and return comments.\n   A second output,\
    \ which is still undergoing development, is NADF-128,\n   a preliminary draft\
    \ on \"Mapping the DIT onto Multiple ADDMDs\".  This\n   describes how the c=US\
    \ portion of the DIT is mapped onto DSAs and\n   what service-providers must minimally\
    \ share in order to achieve a\n   working public directory.  The next revision\
    \ of this document will\n   likely be ASCII-ized and published as an informational\
    \ RFC.\n           NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology)\n   NIST\
    \ is involved in several X.500 activities:  standards, pilot\n   deployment, and\
    \ development of an X.500 implementation, Custos.  The\n   objective is to see\
    \ X.500 widely deployed and used in the U.S.\n   Government.  X.500 is expected\
    \ to be in the next release of the U.S.\n   Government OSI Profile (GOSIP).  In\
    \ the standards efforts, emphasis\n   is on access control and replication; the\
    \ other activities are\n   described in some detail below.\n   o  NIST/GSA X.500\
    \ Pilot Deployment:  NIST and GSA are\n      collaborating in the creation of\
    \ a U.S. Government X.500 pilot\n      deployment.  To date, two meetings have\
    \ been held.  At the\n      second, held on April 25th at NIST, significant progress\
    \ was\n      made towards refining an initial draft schema developed by\n    \
    \  NIST.  A number of government agency requirements will be\n      included in\
    \ the next schema revision.  Once the schema is\n      defined, agencies will\
    \ begin collecting data for loading into\n      the directory.  Initially, NIST\
    \ will offer to host agency data\n      on Custos DSAs running at NIST.  Eventually,\
    \ agencies are\n      expected to obtain and operate DSAs.\n   o  CUSTOS:  The\
    \ NIST X.500 public-domain implementation, Custos,\n      is implemented on ISODE,\
    \ although it otherwise bears no\n      relation to QUIPU.  One of its more interesting\
    \ features is that\n      the DBMS interface is SQL, and we provide a simple DBMS\
    \ as part\n      of Custos to support the DSA.  Information can be optionally\n\
    \      loaded into memory, and the memory usage is reasonably\n      efficient\
    \ on a per-entry basis.\n                     OIW (OSI Implementor's Workshop)\n\
    \   The OSI Implementor's Workshop (OIW) is an open public forum for\n   technical\
    \ issues, concerned with the timely development of\n   implementation agreements\
    \ based on emerging international OSI\n   standards.  The Workshop accepts as\
    \ input the specifications of\n   emerging standards for protocols, and produces\
    \ as output agreements\n   on the implementation and testing particulars of these\
    \ protocols.\n   This process is expected to expedite the development of OSI protocols\n\
    \   and to promote interoperability of independently manufactured data\n   communications\
    \ equipment.\n   The Workshop organizes its work through Special Interest Groups\n\
    \   (SIGs) that prepare technical documentation.  The SIGs are encouraged\n  \
    \ to coordinate with standards organizations and user groups, and to\n   seek\
    \ widespread technical consensus on implementation agreements\n   through international\
    \ discussions and liaison activities.\n   The Directory SIG of the Workshop produces\
    \ agreements on the\n   implementation of Directory protocols based on ISO 9594\
    \ and CCITT\n   X.500 Recommendations.  There are three major areas that the SIG\
    \ is\n   working on for 1991:  access control, replication, and distributed\n\
    \   operations.\n   Mailing list address:\n      General Discussion:  dssig@nisc.sri.com\n\

    \  ISODE/QUIPU 7.0\n   This software supports the development of certain kinds\
    \ of OSI\n   protocols and applications.  Here are the details:\n   o  The ISODE\
    \ is not proprietary, but it is not in the public\n      domain.  This was necessary\
    \ to include a \"hold harmless\"\n      clause in the release.  The upshot of\
    \ all this is that anyone\n      can get a copy of the release and do anything\
    \ they want with\n      it, but no one takes any responsibility whatsoever for\
    \ any\n      (mis)use.\n   o  The ISODE runs on native Berkeley (4.2, 4.3) and\
    \ AT&T System V\n      systems, in addition to various other UNIX-like operating\n\
    \      systems.  No kernel modifications are required.\n   o  Current modules\

    \ too.\n                                  PP 6.0\n   PP is a Message Transfer\
    \ Agent, intended for high volume message\n   switching, protocol conversion,\
    \ and format conversion.  It is\n   targeted for use in an operational environment,\
    \ but is also be useful\n   for investigating message related applications.  Good\
    \ management\n   features are a major aspect of this system.  PP supports the\
    \ 1984 and\n   1988 versions of the CCITT X.400 / ISO 10021 services and protocols.\n\
    \   Many existing RFC-822 based protocols are supported, along with RFC-\n   1148bis\
    \ conversion to X.400.  PP is an appropriate replacement for\n   MMDF or Sendmail.\
    \  This is the second public release of PP, and\n   includes substantial changes\
    \ based on feedback from using PP on many\n   sites.\n   o  PP is not proprietary\
    \ and can be used for any purpose.  The only\n      restriction is that suing\

    \ o  PP runs on a range of UNIX and UNIX-like operating systems,\n      including\
    \ SUNOS, Ultrix, and BSD.  A full list of platforms on\n      which PP is know\
    \ to run is included in the distribution.\n   o  Current modules include:\n  \
    \    -  X.400 (1984) P1 protocol.\n      -  X.400 (1988) P1 protocol.\n      -\
    \  Simple mail transfer protocol (SMTP), conformant to host\n         requirements.\n\
    \      -  JNT mail (grey book) Protocol.\n      -  UUCP mail transfer.\n     \
    \ -  DECNET Mail-11 transfer\n      -  Distribution list expansion and maintenance,\
    \ using either a\n         file based mechanism or an X.500 directory.\n     \
    \ -  RFC 822-based local delivery.\n      -  Delivery time processing of messages.\n\
    \      -  Conversion between X.400 and RFC-822 according to the latest\n     \
    \    revision of RFC-1148, known as RFC-1148bis.\n      -  Conversion support\
    \ for reformatting body parts and headers.\n      -  X-Window and line-based management\
    \ console.\n      -  Message Authorization checking.\n      -  Reformatting support\
    \ for \"mail hub\" operation.\n      -  X.500-based distribution list facility\
    \ using the QUIPU\n         directory.\n      -  FAX interworking\n   o  No User\
    \ Agents (UAs) are included with PP.  However, procedural\n      access to the\
    \ MTA is documented, to encourage others to write\n      or to port UAs.  Several\
    \ existing UAs, such as MH, may be used\n      with PP.\n   o  It is expected\
    \ that a Message Store to be used in conjunction\n      with PP (PPMS), and an\
    \ associated X-Windows User Agent (XUA)\n      will be released on beta test in\
    \ first quarter 92.\n   o  The core routing of PP 6.0 is table based.  DNS is\
    \ used by the\n      SMTP channel.  The next version of PP will support Directory\n\
    \      Based routing, which may use X.500 or DNS.\n   o  PP 6.0 requires ISODE\
    \ 7.0.\n   o  X-Windows release X11R4 (or greater) is needed by some of the\n\
    \      management tools.  PP can be operated without these tools.\n   o  Although\
    \ PP is not \"supported\" per se (but see later), it does\n      have a problem\
    \ reporting address (bug reports (and fixes) are\n      welcome):\n      RFC-822:\

    \ relevant formatting\n   information.\n   Following comment lines, each data\
    \ line contains information about\n   one person.\n   Fields within a single data\
    \ line are separated by a delimiter\n   character.  You specify the delimiter\
    \ character you wish to use in\n   the comment section; be sure to choose a delimiter\
    \ which does not\n   appear as a legitimate character in any field of a data line.\n\
    \   You may provide all or part of the attribute types listed in the\n   table\
    \ in Section 2.5 (commonName is required).  In the comment\n   section, you must\
    \ indicate which attribute types are contained in\n   each field of a data line.\n\
    \   Each data line must contain the same number of fields and the same\n   order\
    \ of fields (i.e. same order of attribute types).  Two successive\n   delimiters\
    \ indicated a null value (eof is a considered a field\n   delimiter).\n   The\
    \ characters \"=\", \"&\", \"$\", and \"#\" are NEVER allowed in any\n   attribute\
    \ value.\n   Below is a discussion of relevant lines of the sample datafile.\n\

    \   attribute.\n   Line 3      Field # 2 is identified as containing the telephoneNumber\n\
    \                 attribute.  The actual data value is a 4-digit\n           \
    \      extension.\n   Lines 4,5   Identify the area code and prefix which apply\
    \ to all\n                 4-digit extensions in the datafile.  If your actual\n\
    \                 data values already contain area code and/or prefix,\n     \
    \            then there would be no need to indicate default values.\n   Line\

    \      attribute.\n   Line 7      Field # 4 is identified as containing the\n\
    \                 facsimileTelephoneNumber attribute.\n   Line 8      Identifies\
    \ the default value for\n                 facsimileTelephoneNumber.  If field\

    \  This then leads to a\n     specification of a standard format for representing\
