- title: Introduction
  contents:
  - "Introduction\n   This RFC describes a protocol to dynamically hand out ip-numbers\
    \ on\n   field networks and small events that don't necessarily have a clear\n\
    \   organisational body.\n   It can also provide some fixed additional fields\
    \ global for all\n   clients like netmask and even autoproxyconfigs. It does not\
    \ depend on\n   a particular ip-stack.\n"
- title: History of the protocol.
  contents:
  - "History of the protocol.\n   The practice of using pegs for assigning IP-numbers\
    \ was first used at\n   the HIP event (http://www.hip97.nl/). HIP stands for Hacking\
    \ In\n   Progress, a large three-day event where more then a thousand hackers\n\
    \   from all over the world gathered. This event needed to have a TCP/IP\n   lan\
    \ with an Internet connection.  Visitors and participants of the\n   HIP could\
    \ bring along computers and hook them up to the HIP network.\n   During preparations\
    \ for the HIP event we ran into the problem of how\n   to assign IP-numbers on\
    \ such a large scale as was predicted for the\n   event without running into troubles\
    \ like assigning duplicate numbers\n   or skipping numbers. Due to the variety\
    \ of expected computers with\n   associated IP stacks a software solution like\
    \ a Unix DHCP server\n   would probably not function for all cases and create\
    \ unexpected\n   technical problems.\n   So a way of centrally administrating\
    \ IP-numbers and giving them out\n   to people to use on their computers had to\
    \ be devised. After some\n   discussion, the idea came up of using wooden clothes-pegs.\
    \ Using pegs\n   has the following advantages in respect to other methods:\n \
    \     - cheap\n      - a peg is a 'token' and represents one IP-number, therefore\n\
    \        making the status of the IP-number (allocated or not allocated)\n   \
    \     visible.\n      - a peg can be clipped to a network cable giving a very\
    \ clear\n        view of where a given IP-number is in use.\n   Credits for the\
    \ original idea of using wooden pegs go to Daniel\n   Ockeloen.\n"
- title: The server.
  contents:
  - "The server.\n   The server can have many appearances. At HIP it was a large tent\n\
    \   situated at the central field where all the activities were. It can\n   also\
    \ be a small table in the corner of a terminalroom.\n   The server can hand out\
    \ two parts to the client, the peg and a paper\n   with additional fields fixed\
    \ for the site the server is running for.\n   We will describe both here.\n"
- title: The peg.
  contents:
  - "The peg.\n   On the peg the IP-number is mentioned. The text on the peg can be\n\
    \   described according to the following BNF:\n   Total ::== IP | Net\n   IP ::==\
    \ num.num.num.num | num.num | num\n   Net ::== num.num.num/mask | num.num/mask\
    \ | num/mask\n   num ::== {1..255}\n   mask ::== {8..31}\n   The Net-method of\
    \ writing larger nets is an optional part of the\n   protocol, it doesn't have\
    \ to be implemented. If it is implemented, it\n   requires more administration\
    \ at the server (see below).\n   The short versions of the IP-number with only\
    \ 1 or 2 chunks are meant\n   for large servers where writing the whole number\
    \ on the peg is just\n   boring and time-consuming. It requires the prefix to\
    \ be mentioned on\n   the additional field paper, but that can be produced in\
    \ more\n   convenient ways. It is not recommended to work with more prefixes.\
    \ It\n   is better to write more numbers on the peg and use a smaller prefix.\n\
    \   If the network to be numbered is rather large and some kind of\n   subnetting\
    \ has to be implemented it is possible to give the pegs from\n   the different\
    \ subnets different colors. This has proven to be a very\n   convenient way at\
    \ HIP.\n"
- title: The additional vendorfield paper.
  contents:
  - "The additional vendorfield paper.\n   This part is meant for information that\
    \ is fixed for the whole site.\n   It can either be implemented as small printed\
    \ notes handed out with\n   the peg or as a large paper billboard hung at a convenient\
    \ place\n   where everybody can read it.\n   The information can be described\
    \ with the following BNF:\n   Network ::== num.num.num.num\n   Netmask ::== num.num.num.num\
    \ | num\n   Gateway ::== num.num.num.num | num.num | num\n   Proxy ::== num.num.num.num:port\
    \ | num.num:port | num:port\n   Paper ::== Network Netmask Gateway Proxy | Network\
    \ Netmask Gateway\n   num ::== {0..255}\n   port ::== {1..65535}\n   The paper\
    \ and the peg are of course one part, if two numbers are used\n   on the peg,\
    \ two numbers are used on the paper.\n   Because it is fixed information, it can\
    \ be produced with means of\n   mass-production (printing, copying).\n"
- title: The IP-repository
  contents:
  - "The IP-repository\n   Due to the nature of the peg, the repository can be quite\
    \ simple.\n   Just a clothes-line with all the pegs that are ready to be handed\
    \ out\n   attached to it. If you work with different subnets, it is convenient\n\
    \   to group the pegs for the different subnets (colors).\n   At large networks\
    \ where it is not really known how many IP-numbers\n   are needed, a first set\
    \ of pegs can be made in advance, and the\n   administration of produced pegs\
    \ kept on paper so it is known for\n   which numbers pegs have already been made.\
    \ If use is made of the\n   net-extension on the pegs, numbers given out that\
    \ way can be\n   administrated this way too.\n"
- title: Issuing IP-numbers.
  contents:
  - "Issuing IP-numbers.\n   The pegs and the IP-numbers are issued at the server\
    \ to the client.\n   Normally the client has to visit the server personally. Depending\
    \ on\n   how secure and controlled you want the process, the client has to ask\n\
    \   for a peg to a responsible person, or he or she can just get a peg\n   from\
    \ store himself.\n   If someone could apply for a networkrange, and he net-extension\
    \ isn't\n   used, coat-hangers can be prepared with sets of pegs attached to\n\
    \   them.\n   The vendorfields paper doesn't have to be issued with every peg,\
    \ it\n   is only needed when wanted.\n"
- title: Reclaiming and reusing IP-numbers.
  contents:
  - "Reclaiming and reusing IP-numbers.\n   It is not easy to implement a TTL in this\
    \ protocol. One obvious TTL\n   is the duration of the event after which the IP-numbers\
    \ are not valid\n   anymore.\n   However, if a client decides that it doesn't\
    \ need an IP-number\n   anymore it can bring the peg back to the server.\n   The\
    \ server should at that point decide what to do, if desired, it can\n   bring\
    \ the peg back into the pool (attach it to the clothes-line\n   again).\n   If\
    \ the server is not manned (the client has to help themselves), the\n   only thing\
    \ possible is that the client just places the peg back into\n   the pool.\n"
- title: The client side.
  contents:
  - "The client side.\n   The optimum location for the peg is clipped to the network\
    \ cable near\n   the NIC of the device needing an IP-number allocated. This ensures\
    \ a\n   clear visual connection between the device and the IP-number\n   allocated\
    \ and makes it an easy task to see which IP-number is\n   allocated.\n   Transfer\
    \ of the IP information from the peg and the additional\n   vendorfield paper\
    \ note to the settings in the IP stack is done by\n   human transfer. A person\
    \ reads the information from the peg and from\n   the additional information and\
    \ enters this in the configuration of\n   the used IP stack.  This transfer is\
    \ not completely free of\n   corruption of the information or loss of the information\
    \ contained on\n   the peg.\n   A certain amount of knowledge of the logic of\
    \ IP settings is also\n   assumed on the part of the person transferring the information.\n\
    \   Other information on the vendorfield paper note has to be transferred\n  \
    \ to the settings within specific application programs.\n"
- title: Use with other protocols
  contents:
  - "Use with other protocols\n   This protocol could be combined with avian carriers\
    \ as described in\n   RFC 1149 to hand out IP-numbers remote.\n   At the first\
    \ avian carrier, the peg is clipped to the leg of the\n   carrier after rolling\
    \ the additional vendorfield paper around it.\n   The remote site can take the\
    \ peg on arrival of the avian carrier and\n   use the information on it.\n   This\
    \ part of the protocol is still experimental and requires some\n   additional\
    \ research on topics like the weight of the peg and loss of\n   the peg/whole\
    \ carrier.\n"
- title: Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "Security Considerations\n   Some remarks about security can be made.\n   Pegs\
    \ are small devices and can be lost. At that time, the IP-number\n   which was\
    \ lost can't be used anymore because someone else can find\n   the peg and use\
    \ the information stored on it.  But, once the peg is\n   attached to a network\
    \ cable, the chance to loose the peg is\n   minimized.\n   All the information\
    \ on both the peg and on the additional 'fixed'\n   fields on the paper record\
    \ are plain text and readable for everyone.\n   Private information should not\
    \ be exchanged through this protocol.\n   On the client side all sorts of clients\
    \ exist and cooperate freely.\n   Due to the human factor of the clients transferring\
    \ information from\n   peg to IP stack, the information can be misinterpreted,\
    \ which could\n   cause network troubles.  In the field test at HIP this became\n\
    \   perfectly clear when someone mixed up the numbers and used the\n   address\
    \ from the default router as his IP-number, rendering the\n   network useless\
    \ for a period of time.\n"
