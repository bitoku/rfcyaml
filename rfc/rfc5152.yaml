  - "1.  Introduction\n   The requirements for inter-domain Traffic Engineering (inter-area
    and\n   inter-AS TE) have been developed by the Traffic Engineering Working\n
    \  Group and have been stated in [RFC4105] and [RFC4216].  The framework\n   for
    inter-domain MPLS Traffic Engineering has been provided in\n   [RFC4726].\n   Some
    of the mechanisms used to establish and maintain inter-domain TE\n   LSPs are
    specified in [RFC5151] and [RFC5150].\n   This document exclusively focuses on
    the path computation aspects and\n   defines a method for establishing inter-domain
    TE LSPs where each\n   node in charge of computing a section of an inter-domain
    TE LSP path\n   is always along the path of such a TE LSP.\n   When the visibility
    of an end-to-end complete path spanning multiple\n   domains is not available
    at the Head-end LSR (the LSR that initiated\n   the TE LSP), one approach described
    in this document consists of\n   using a per-domain path computation technique
    during LSP setup to\n   determine the inter-domain TE LSP as it traverses multiple
    domains.\n   The mechanisms proposed in this document are also applicable to MPLS\n
    \  TE domains other than IGP areas and ASs.\n   The solution described in this
    document does not attempt to address\n   all the requirements specified in [RFC4105]
    and [RFC4216].  This is\n   acceptable according to [RFC4216], which indicates
    that a solution\n   may be developed to address a particular deployment scenario
    and\n   might, therefore, not meet all requirements for other deployment\n   scenarios.\n
    \  It must be pointed out that the inter-domain path computation\n   technique
    proposed in this document is one among many others.  The\n   choice of the appropriate
    technique must be driven by the set of\n   requirements for the path attributes
    and the applicability to a\n   particular technique with respect to the deployment
    scenario.  For\n   example, if the requirement is to get an end-to-end constraint-based\n
    \  shortest path across multiple domains, then a mechanism using one or\n   more
    distributed PCEs could be used to compute the shortest path\n   across different
    domains (see [RFC4655]).  Other off-line mechanisms\n   for path computation are
    not precluded either.  Note also that a\n   Service Provider may elect to use
    different inter-domain path\n   computation techniques for different TE LSP types.\n"

    - "3.1.  Common Assumptions\n   - Each domain in all the examples below is assumed
      to be capable of\n     doing Traffic Engineering (i.e., running OSPF-TE or ISIS-TE
      and\n     RSVP-TE (Resource Reservation Protocol Traffic Engineering)).  A\n
      \    domain may itself comprise multiple other domains, e.g., an AS may\n     itself
      be composed of several other sub-ASs (BGP confederations) or\n     areas/levels.
      \ In this case, the path computation technique\n     described for inter-area
      and inter-AS MPLS Traffic Engineering\n     applies recursively.\n   - The inter-domain
      TE LSPs are signaled using RSVP-TE ([RFC3209] and\n     [RFC3473]).\n   - The
      path (specified by an ERO (Explicit Route Object) in an RSVP-TE\n     Path message)
      for an inter-domain TE LSP may be signaled as a set\n     of (loose and/or strict)
      hops.\n   - The hops may identify:\n      * The complete strict path end-to-end
      across different domains\n      * The complete strict path in the source domain
      followed by\n         boundary LSRs (or domain identifiers, e.g., AS numbers)\n
      \     * The complete list of boundary LSRs along the path\n      * The current
      boundary LSR and the LSP destination\n   The set of (loose or strict) hops can
      be either statically configured\n   on the Head-end LSR or dynamically computed.
      \ A per-domain path\n   computation method is defined in this document with
      an optional\n   auto-discovery mechanism (e.g., based on IGP, BGP, policy routing\n
      \  information) yielding the next-hop boundary node (domain exit point,\n   such
      as an Area Border Router (ABR) or an Autonomous System Border\n   Router (ASBR))
      along the path as the TE LSP is being signaled, along\n   with potential crankback
      mechanisms.  Alternatively, the domain exit\n   points may be statically configured
      on the Head-end LSR, in which\n   case next-hop boundary node auto-discovery
      would not be required.\n   - Boundary LSRs are assumed to be capable of performing
      local path\n     computation for expansion of a loose next hop in the signaled
      ERO\n     if the path is not signaled by the Head-end LSR as a set of strict\n
      \    hops or if the strict hop is an abstract node (e.g., an AS).  In\n     any
      case, no topology or resource information needs to be\n     distributed between
      domains (as mandated per [RFC4105] and\n     [RFC4216]), which is critical to
      preserve IGP/BGP scalability and\n     confidentiality in the case of TE LSPs
      spanning multiple routing\n     domains.\n   - The paths for the intra-domain
      Hierarchical LSP (H-LSP) or Stitched\n     LSP (S-LSP) or for a contiguous TE
      LSP within the domain may be\n     pre-configured or computed dynamically based
      on the arriving\n     inter-domain LSP setup request (depending on the requirements
      of\n     the transit domain).  Note that this capability is explicitly\n     specified
      as a requirement in [RFC4216].  When the paths for the\n     H-LSP/S-LSP are
      pre-configured, the constraints as well as other\n     parameters like a local
      protection scheme for the intra-domain H-\n     LSP/S-LSP are also pre-configured.\n
      \  - While certain constraints like bandwidth can be used across\n     different
      domains, certain other TE constraints like resource\n     affinity, color, metric,
      etc. as listed in [RFC2702] may need to be\n     translated at domain boundaries.
      \ If required, it is assumed that,\n     at the domain boundary LSRs, there
      will exist some sort of local\n     mapping based on policy agreement in order
      to translate such\n     constraints across domain boundaries.  It is expected
      that such an\n     assumption particularly applies to inter-AS TE: for example,
      the\n     local mapping would be similar to the inter-AS TE agreement\n     enforcement
      polices stated in [RFC4216].\n   - The procedures defined in this document are
      applicable to any node\n     (not just a boundary node) that receives a Path
      message with an ERO\n     that constrains a loose hop or an abstract node that
      is not a\n     simple abstract node (that is, an abstract node that identifies\n
      \    more than one LSR).\n"

  title: 3.  General Assumptions
- contents:
  - "4.  Per-Domain Path Computation Procedures\n   The mechanisms for inter-domain
    TE LSP computation as described in\n   this document can be used regardless of
    the nature of the\n   inter-domain TE LSP (contiguous, stitched, or nested).\n
    \  Note that any path can be defined as a set of loose and strict hops.\n   In
    other words, in some cases, it might be desirable to rely on the\n   dynamic path
    computation in some domains, and exert a strict control\n   on the path in other
    domains (defining strict hops).\n   When an LSR that is a boundary node such as
    an ABR/ASBR receives a\n   Path message with an ERO that contains a strict node,
    the procedures\n   specified in [RFC3209] apply and no further action is needed.\n
    \  When an LSR that is a boundary node such as an ABR/ASBR receives a\n   Path
    message with an ERO that contains a loose hop or an abstract\n   node that is
    not a simple abstract node (that is, an abstract node\n   that identifies more
    than one LSR), then it MUST follow the\n   procedures as described in [RFC5151].\n
    \  In addition, the following procedures describe the path computation\n   procedures
    that SHOULD be carried out on the LSR:\n   1) If the next hop is not present in
    the TED, the two following\n      conditions MUST be checked:\n      o  Whether
    the IP address of the next-hop boundary LSR is outside\n         of the current
    domain\n      o  Whether the next-hop domain is PSC (Packet Switch Capable) and\n
    \        uses in-band control channel\n   If the two conditions above are satisfied,
    then the boundary LSR\n   SHOULD check if the next hop has IP reachability (via
    IGP or BGP).\n   If the next hop is not reachable, then a signaling failure occurs
    and\n   the LSR SHOULD send back an RSVP PathErr message upstream with error\n
    \  code=24 (\"Routing Problem\") and error subcode as described in section\n   4.3.4
    of [RFC3209].  If the available routing information indicates\n   that next hop
    is reachable, the selected route will be expected to\n   pass through a domain
    boundary via a domain boundary LSR.  The\n   determination of domain boundary
    point based on routing information\n   is what we term as \"auto-discovery\" in
    this document.  In the absence\n   of such an auto-discovery mechanism, a) the
    ABR in the case of\n   inter-area TE or the ASBR in the next-hop AS in the case
    of inter-AS\n   TE should be the signaled loose next hop in the ERO and hence
    should\n   be accessible via the TED, or b) there needs to be an alternate\n   scheme
    that provides the domain exit points.  Otherwise, the path\n   computation for
    the inter-domain TE LSP will fail.\n   An implementation MAY support the ability
    to disable such an IP\n   reachability fall-back option should the next-hop boundary
    LSR not be\n   present in the TED.  In other words, an implementation MAY support\n
    \  the possibility to trigger a signaling failure whenever the next hop\n   is
    not present in the TED.\n   2) Once the next-hop boundary LSR has been determined
    (according to\n      the procedure described in 1)) or if the next-hop boundary
    is\n      present in the TED:\n      o  Case of a contiguous TE LSP.  Unless not
    allowed by policy, the\n         boundary LSR that processes the ERO SHOULD perform
    an ERO\n         expansion (a process consisting of computing the constrained\n
    \        path up to the next loose hop and adding the list of hops as\n         strict
    nodes in the ERO).  If no path satisfying the set of\n         constraints can
    be found, then this is treated as a path\n         computation and signaling failure
    and an RSVP PathErr message\n         SHOULD be sent for the inter-domain TE LSP
    based on section\n         4.3.4 of [RFC3209].\n      o  Case of a stitched or
    nested TE LSP\n         *  If the boundary LSR is a candidate LSR for intra-area
    H-LSP/\n            S-LSP setup (the boundary has local policy for nesting or\n
    \           stitching), the TE LSP is a candidate for hierarchy/nesting\n            (the
    \"Contiguous LSP\" bit defined in [RFC5151] is not set),\n            and if there
    is no H-LSP/S-LSP from this LSR to the next-hop\n            boundary LSR that
    satisfies the constraints, it SHOULD\n            signal an H-LSP/S-LSP to the
    next-hop boundary LSR.  If a\n            pre-configured H-LSP(s) or S-LSP(s)
    already exists, then it\n            will try to select from among those intra-domain
    LSPs.\n            Depending on local policy, it MAY signal a new H-LSP/S-LSP\n
    \           if this selection fails.  If the H-LSP/S-LSP is successfully\n            signaled
    or selected, it propagates the inter-domain Path\n            message to the next
    hop following the procedures described\n            in [RFC5151].  If for some
    reason the dynamic H-LSP/S-LSP\n            setup to the next-hop boundary LSR
    fails, then this SHOULD\n            be treated as a path computation and signaling
    failure and\n            an RSVP PathErr message SHOULD be sent upstream for the\n
    \           inter-domain LSP.  Similarly, if selection of a pre-\n            configured
    H-LSP/S-LSP fails and local policy prevents\n            dynamic H-LSP/S, this

    H-LSP/S-LSP (the boundary LSR does not have\n            local policy for nesting
    or stitching) or the TE LSP is not\n            a candidate for hierarchy/nesting
    (the \"Contiguous LSP\" bit\n            defined in [RFC5151] is set), then it
    SHOULD apply the same\n            procedure as for the contiguous case.\n   The

    \  Note the following related to the inter-AS TE case:\n   In terms of computation
    of an inter-AS TE LSP path, an interesting\n   optimization technique consists
    of allowing the ASBRs to flood the TE\n   information related to the inter-ASBR
    link(s) although no IGP TE is\n   enabled over those links (and so there is no
    IGP adjacency over the\n   inter-ASBR links).  This of course implies that the

    inter-ASBR links\n   Referring to Figure 3, ASBR1 for example would advertise
    in its OSPF\n   Link State Advertisement (LSA)/IS-IS LSP the Traffic Engineering
    TLVs\n   related to the link ASBR1-ASBR4.\n   This allows an LSR (could be the
    entry ASBR) in the previous AS to\n   make a more appropriate route selection
    up to the entry ASBR in the\n   immediately downstream AS taking into account
    the constraints\n   associated with the inter-ASBR links.  This reduces the risk
    of call\n   setup failure due to inter-ASBR links not satisfying the inter-AS
    TE\n   LSP set of constraints.  Note that the TE information is only related\n
    \  to the inter-ASBR links: the TE LSA/LSP flooded by the ASBR includes\n   not
    only the TE-enabled links contained in the AS but also the\n   inter-ASBR links.\n
    \  Note that no summarized TE information is leaked between ASs, which\n   is
    compliant with the requirements listed in [RFC4105] and [RFC4216].\n   For example,
    consider the diagram depicted in Figure 2: when ASBR1\n   floods its IGP TE LSA
    ((opaque LSA for OSPF)/LSP (TLV 22 for IS-IS))\n   in its routing domain, it reflects
    the reservation states and TE\n   properties of the following links: X1-ASBR1,
    ASBR1-ASBR2, and\n   ASBR1-ASBR4.\n   Thanks to such an optimization, the inter-ASBR
    TE link information\n   corresponding to the links originated by the ASBR is made
    available\n   in the TED of other LSRs in the same domain to which the ASBR\n
    \  belongs.  Consequently, the path computation for an inter-AS TE LSP\n   path
    can also take into account the inter-ASBR link(s).  This will\n   improve the
    chance of successful signaling along the next AS in case\n   of resource shortage
    or unsatisfied constraints on inter-ASBR links,\n   and it potentially reduces
    one level of crankback.  Note that no\n   topology information is flooded, and
    these links are not used in IGP\n   SPF computations.  Only the TE information
    for the outgoing links\n   directly connected to the ASBR is advertised.\n   Note
    that an operator may decide to operate a stitched segment or\n   1-hop hierarchical
    LSP for the inter-ASBR link.\n"

      or nested inter-domain TE LSP, the\n   reoptimization process is treated as
      a local matter to any domain.\n   The main reason is that the inter-domain TE
      LSP is a different LSP\n   (and therefore different RSVP session) from the intra-domain
      S-LSP or\n   H-LSP in an area or an AS.  Therefore, reoptimization in a domain
      is\n   done by locally reoptimizing the intra-domain H-LSP or S-LSP.  Since\n
      \  the inter-domain TE LSPs are transported using S-LSP or H-LSP across\n   each
      domain, optimality of the inter-domain TE LSP in a domain is\n   dependent on
      the optimality of the corresponding S-LSP or H-LSP.  If\n   after an inter-domain
      LSP is set up a more optimal path is available\n   within a domain, the corresponding
      S-LSP or H-LSP will be reoptimized\n   using Make-Before-Break techniques discussed
      in [RFC3209].\n   Reoptimization of the H-LSP or S-LSP automatically reoptimizes
      the\n   inter-domain TE LSPs that the H-LSP or S-LSP transports.\n   Reoptimization
      parameters like frequency of reoptimization, criteria\n   for reoptimization
      like metric or bandwidth availability, etc. can\n   vary from one domain to
      another and can be configured as required,\n   per intra-domain TE S-LSP or
      H-LSP if it is pre-configured or based\n   on some global policy within the
      domain.\n   Hence, in this scheme, since each domain takes care of reoptimizing\n
      \  its own S-LSPs or H-LSPs, and therefore the corresponding\n   inter-domain
      TE LSPs, the Make-Before-Break can happen locally and is\n   not triggered by
      the Head-end LSR for the inter-domain LSP.  So, no\n   additional RSVP signaling
      is required for LSP reoptimization, and\n   reoptimization is transparent to
      the Head-end LSR of the inter-domain\n   TE LSP.\n   If, however, an operator
      desires to manually trigger reoptimization\n   at the Head-end LSR for the inter-domain
      TE LSP, then this solution\n   does not prevent that.  A manual trigger for
      reoptimization at the\n   Head-end LSR SHOULD force a reoptimization thereby
      signaling a \"new\"\n   path for the same LSP (along the more optimal path)
      making use of the\n   Make-Before-Break procedure.  In response to this new
      setup request,\n   the boundary LSR either may initiate new S-LSP setup, in
      case the\n   inter-domain TE LSP is being stitched to the intra-domain S-LSP,
      or\n   it may select an existing or new H-LSP, in case of nesting.  When the\n
      \  LSP setup along the current path is complete, the Head-end LSR should\n   switch
      over the traffic onto that path, and the old path is\n   eventually torn down.
      \ Note that the Head-end LSR does not know a\n   priori whether a more optimal
      path exists.  Such a manual trigger\n   from the Head-end LSR of the inter-domain
      TE LSP is, however, not\n   considered to be a frequent occurrence.\n   Procedures
      described in [RFC4736] MUST be used if the operator does\n   not desire local
      reoptimization of certain inter-domain LSPs.  In\n   this case, any reoptimization
      event within the domain MUST be\n   reported to the Head-end node.  This SHOULD

    also share the key.  For an\n   inter-domain TE LSP, especially when it traverses
    different\n   administrative or trust domains, the following mechanisms SHOULD
    be\n   provided to an operator (also see [RFC4216]):\n   1) A way to enforce policies
    and filters at the domain borders to\n      process the incoming inter-domain
    TE LSP setup requests (Path\n      messages) based on certain agreed trust and
    service\n      levels/contracts between domains.  Various LSP attributes such
    as\n      bandwidth, priority, etc. could be part of such a contract.\n   2) A
    way for the operator to rate-limit LSP setup requests or error\n      notifications
    from a particular domain.\n   3) A mechanism to allow policy-based outbound RSVP
    message processing\n      at the domain border node, which may involve filtering
    or\n      modification of certain addresses in RSVP objects and messages.\n   This
    document relates to inter-domain path computation.  It must be\n   noted that
    the process for establishing paths described in this\n   document does not increase
    the information exchanged between ASs and\n   preserves topology confidentiality,
    in compliance with [RFC4105] and\n   [RFC4216].  That being said, the signaling
    of inter-domain TE LSP\n   according to the procedure defined in this document
    requires path\n   computation on boundary nodes that may be exposed to various
    attacks.\n   Thus, it is RECOMMENDED to support policy decisions to reject the
    ERO\n   expansion of an inter-domain TE LSP if not allowed.\n"
