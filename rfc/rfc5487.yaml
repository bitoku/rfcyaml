  - "1.  Introduction\n   The benefits of pre-shared symmetric-key vs. public-/private-key\
    \ pair\n   based authentication for the key exchange in TLS have been explained\n\
    \   in the Introduction of [RFC4279].  This document leverages the\n   already\
    \ defined algorithms for the application of newer, generally\n   regarded stronger,\
    \ cryptographic primitives and building blocks.\n   TLS 1.2 [RFC5246] adds support\
    \ for authenticated encryption with\n   additional data (AEAD) cipher modes [RFC5116].\
    \  This document\n   describes the use of Advanced Encryption Standard [AES] in\
    \ Galois\n   Counter Mode [GCM] (AES-GCM) with various pre-shared key (PSK)\n\
    \   authenticated key exchange mechanisms ([RFC4279] and [RFC4785]) in\n   cipher\
    \ suites for TLS.\n   This document also specifies PSK cipher suites for TLS that\
    \ replace\n   SHA-1 by SHA-256 or SHA-384 [SHS].  RFC 4279 [RFC4279] and RFC 4785\n\
    \   [RFC4785] describe PSK cipher suites for TLS.  However, all of the\n   RFC\
    \ 4279 and the RFC 4785 cipher suites use HMAC-SHA1 as their MAC\n   algorithm.\
    \  Due to recent analytic work on SHA-1 [Wang05], the IETF\n   is gradually moving\
    \ away from SHA-1 and towards stronger hash\n   algorithms.\n   Related TLS cipher\
    \ suites with key exchange algorithms that are\n   authenticated using public/private\
    \ key pairs have recently been\n   specified:\n   o  RSA-, DSS-, and Diffie-Hellman-based\
    \ cipher suites in [RFC5288],\n      and\n   o  ECC-based cipher suites with SHA-256/384\
    \ and AES-GCM in [RFC5289].\n   The reader is expected to become familiar with\
    \ these two memos prior\n   to studying this document.\n"

    \ function.\n   o  For cipher suites ending with _SHA384, the PRF is the TLS PRF\n\
    \      [RFC5246] with SHA-384 as the hash function.\n   Implementations MUST send\
    \ a TLS Alert 'bad_record_mac' for all types\n   of failures encountered in processing\
