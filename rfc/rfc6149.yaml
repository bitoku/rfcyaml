- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   MD2 [MD2] is a message digest algorithm that takes as input\
    \ a message\n   of arbitrary length and produces as output a 128-bit \"fingerprint\"\
    \ or\n   \"message digest\" of the input.  This document retires MD2.\n   Specifically,\
    \ this document moves RFC 1319 [MD2] to Historic status.\n   The reasons for taking\
    \ this action are discussed.\n   [HASH-Attack] summarizes the use of hashes in\
    \ many protocols and\n   discusses how attacks against a message digest algorithm's\
    \ one-way\n   and collision-free properties affect and do not affect Internet\n\
    \   protocols.  Familiarity with [HASH-Attack] is assumed.\n"
- title: 2.  Rationale
  contents:
  - "2.  Rationale\n   MD2 was published in 1992 as an Informational RFC.  Since its\n\
    \   publication, MD2 has been shown to not be collision-free [ROCH1995]\n   [KNMA2005]\
    \ [ROCH1997], albeit successful collision attacks for\n   properly implemented\
    \ MD2 are not that damaging.  Successful pre-image\n   and second pre-image attacks\
    \ against MD2 have been shown [KNMA2005]\n   [MULL2004] [KMM2010].\n"

- title: 4.  Impact on Moving MD2 to Historic
  contents:
  - "4.  Impact on Moving MD2 to Historic\n   The impact of moving MD2 to Historic\
    \ on the RFCs specified in Section\n   3 is minimal, as described below.\n   Regarding\
    \ PS RFCs:\n   o MD2 support in TLS was dropped in TLS 1.1.\n   o MD2 support\
    \ is optional in [RFC4572], and SHA-1 is specified as the\n     preferred algorithm.\n\
    \   o MD2 is included in the original PKIX certificate profile and the\n     PKIX\
    \ algorithm document [RFC3279] for compatibility with older\n     applications,\
    \ but its use is discouraged.  SHA-1 is identified as\n     the preferred algorithm\
    \ for the Internet PKI.\n   Regarding Informational RFCs:\n   o The Internet Users'\
    \ Guide [RFC1983] provided a definition for\n     Message Digest and listed MD2\
    \ as one example.\n   o PKCS#1 v1.5 [RFC2313] stated that there are no known attacks\n\
    \     against MD2.  PKCS#1 v2.0 [RFC2437] updated this stance to indicate\n  \
    \   that MD2 should only be supported for backward compatibility and to\n    \
    \ mention the attacks in [ROCH1995].  PKCS#1 [RFC3447] indicates that\n     support\
    \ of MD2 is only retained for compatibility with existing\n     applications.\n\
    \   o PKCS#5 [RFC2898] recommends that the Password-Based Encryption\n     Scheme\
    \ (PBES) that uses MD2 not be used for new applications.\n   o PKCS#7 [RFC2315]\
    \ was replaced by a series of Standards Track\n     publications, \"Cryptographic\
    \ Message Syntax\" [RFC2630] [RFC3369]\n     [RFC5652] and \"Cryptographic Message\
    \ Syntax (CMS) Algorithms\"\n     [RFC3370].  Support for MD2 was dropped in [RFC3370].\n\
    \   RFC 2818, \"HTTP Over TLS\", which does not reference MD2, largely\n   supplanted\
    \ implementation of [RFC2660].  [RFC2660] specified MD2 for\n   use both as a\
    \ digest algorithm and as a MAC (Message Authentication\n   Code) algorithm [RFC2104].\
    \  Note that this is the only reference to\n   HMAC-MD2 found in the RFC repository.\n"
- title: 5.  Other Considerations
  contents:
  - "5.  Other Considerations\n   MD2 has also fallen out of favor because it is slower\
    \ than both MD4\n   [MD4] and MD5 [MD5].  This is because MD2 was optimized for\
    \ 8-bit\n   machines, while MD4 and MD5 were optimized for 32-bit machines.  MD2\n\
    \   is also slower than the Secure Hash Standard (SHS) [SHS] algorithms:\n   SHA-1,\
    \ SHA-224, SHA-256, SHA-384, and SHA-512.\n"
- title: 6.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "6.  Security Considerations\n   MD2 is different from MD4 and MD5 in that is\
    \ not a straight Merkle-\n   Damgaard design.  For a padded message with t blocks,\
    \ it generates a\n   nonlinear checksum as its t+1 block.  The checksum is considered\
    \ as\n   the final block input of MD2.\n   As confirmed in 1997 by Rogier et al.\
    \ [ROCH1997], the collision\n   resistance property of MD2 highly depends on the\
    \ nonlinear checksum.\n   Without the checksum, a collision can be found in 2^12\
    \ MD2\n   operations, while with the checksum, the best collision attack takes\n\
    \   2^63.3 operations with 2^50 memory complexity [MULL2004], which is\n   not\
    \ significantly better than the birthday attack.\n   Even though collision attacks\
    \ on MD2 are not significantly more\n   powerful than the birthday attack, MD2\
    \ was found not to be one-way.\n   In [KMM2010], a pre-image can be found with\
    \ 2^104 MD2 operations.  In\n   an improved attack described in [KMM2010], a pre-image\
    \ can be found\n   in 2^73 MD2 operations.  Because of this \"invertible\" property\
    \ of\n   MD2, when using MD2 in HMAC, it may leak information of the keys.\n \
    \  Obviously, the pre-image attack can be used to find a second pre-\n   image.\
    \  The second pre-image attack is even more severe than a\n   collision attack\
    \ to digital signatures.  Therefore, MD2 must not be\n   used for digital signatures.\n\
    \   Some may find the guidance for key lengths and algorithm strengths in\n  \
    \ [SP800-57] and [SP800-131] useful.\n"
- title: 7.  Recommendation
  contents:
  - "7.  Recommendation\n   Despite MD2 seeing some deployment on the Internet, this\n\
    \   specification recommends obsoleting MD2.  MD2 is not a reasonable\n   candidate\
    \ for further standardization and should be deprecated in\n   favor of one or\
    \ more existing hash algorithms (e.g., SHA-256 [SHS]).\n   RSA Security considers\
    \ it appropriate to move the MD2 algorithm to\n   Historic status.\n   It takes\
    \ a number of years to deploy crypto and it also takes a\n   number of years to\
    \ withdraw it.  Algorithms need to be withdrawn\n   before a catastrophic break\
    \ is discovered.  MD2 is clearly showing\n   signs of weakness, and implementations\
    \ should strongly consider\n   removing support and migrating to another hash\
    \ algorithm.\n"
