  - "1.  Introduction\n   ENUM (E.164 Number Mapping, [RFC3761]) is a system that\
    \ transforms\n   E.164 numbers [E164] into domain names and then queries the DNS\n\
    \   (Domain Name Service) [RFC1034] for NAPTR (Naming Authority Pointer)\n   records\
    \ [RFC3401] in order to look up which services are available\n   for a specific\
    \ domain name.\n   ENUM, as defined in RFC 3761 (User ENUM), is not well suited\
    \ for the\n   purpose of interconnection by carriers and voice-service providers,\n\
    \   as can be seen by the use of various private tree arrangements based\n   on\
    \ ENUM mechanisms.\n   Infrastructure ENUM is defined as the use of the technology\
    \ in RFC\n   3761 [RFC3761] by the carrier-of-record (voice service provider)\n\
    \   [RFC5067] for a specific E.164 number [E164] in order to publish a\n   mapping\
    \ of this telephone number to one or more Uniform Resource\n   Identifiers (URIs)\
    \ [RFC3986].\n   Other voice service providers can query the DNS for this mapping\
    \ and\n   use the resulting URIs as input into their call-routing algorithm.\n\
    \   These URIs are separate from any URIs that the end-user who registers\n  \
    \ an E.164 number in ENUM may wish to associate with that E.164 number.\n   The\
    \ requirements, terms, and definitions for Infrastructure ENUM are\n   defined\
    \ in [RFC5067].\n   Using the same E.164 number to domain mapping techniques for\
    \ other\n   applications under a different, internationally agreed-upon apex\n\
    \   (instead of e164.arpa) is straightforward on the technical side.\n   This\
    \ process of defining the Dynamic Delegation Discovery System\n   (DDDS) [RFC3401]\
    \ application for Infrastructure ENUM is defined in\n   [RFC5526].  This is the\
    \ long-term solution.\n   This document presents an interim solution for Infrastructure\
    \ ENUM\n   and a mechanism for transitioning to the long-term solution.  The\n\
    \   interim solution is based on establishing a branch in the e164.arpa\n   tree,\
    \ which resolvers may locate by following the algorithm described\n   in Section\
    \ 4.  The location of the branch is dependent upon country-\n   code length, and\
    \ thus resolvers must determine the position of the\n   branch based on the method\
    \ described in Section 5.  Finally,\n   Section 6 provides a way that implementations\
    \ following the\n   procedures of Sections 4 and 5 may be seamlessly redirected\
    \ to the\n   long-term solution, when it becomes available.\n"

- title: 3.  Interim Solution
  contents:
  - "3.  Interim Solution\n   The agreements to establish the long-term solution may\
    \ take some\n   time.  It was therefore decided to develop an interim solution\
    \ that\n   can be used by individual countries to implement an interoperable\n\
    \   Infrastructure ENUM tree immediately.  The interim solution will be\n   deprecated\
    \ when the long-term solution [RFC5526] is deployed.  It is\n   therefore also\
    \ required that the interim solution includes a smooth\n   migration path to the\
    \ long-term solution.\n   It is also required that existing ENUM clients querying\
    \ User ENUM as\n   defined in RFC 3761 [RFC3761] continue to work without any\n\
    \   modification.\n   Because of various reasons (e.g., potentially different\
    \ delegation\n   points, different reliability requirements, and use of DNS\n\
    \   wildcards), sharing a single domain name between the user itself and\n   the\
    \ respective carrier for a given number is not possible.  Hence, a\n   different\
    \ domain name must be used to store infrastructure ENUM\n   information.\n   In\
    \ order to avoid the delays associated with the long-term solution,\n   the existing\
    \ delegations and agreements around e164.arpa need to be\n   leveraged.\n   The\
    \ method most easily fulfilling the requirements is to branch off\n   the e164.arpa\
    \ tree into a subdomain at the country-code delegation\n   level below e164.arpa\
    \ and deploy an Infrastructure ENUM subtree\n   underneath, without touching User\
    \ ENUM semantics at all.\n   This allows countries using a dedicated country code\
    \ to introduce the\n   interim solution as a national matter to the concerned\
    \ National\n   Regulation Authority (NRA).  The governing body of a shared country\n\
    \   code and the owner of a global network code can also choose to\n   implement\
    \ this solution within their area of responsibility.\n   Under this approach,\
    \ ITU-T (International Telecommunication Union /\n   Telecommunication Standardization\
    \ Sector), IETF, and IAB involvement\n   is only lightweight, e.g., to recommend\
    \ the proper algorithm defined\n   here to enable international interoperability.\n"
- title: 4.  The Algorithm
  contents:
  - "4.  The Algorithm\n   RFC 3761 defines ENUM as a Dynamic Delegation Discovery\
    \ System (DDDS)\n   application according to RFC 3401 [RFC3401].  As such, ENUM\
    \ defines\n   the following components of the DDDS algorithm:\n   1.  Application\
    \ Unique String\n   2.  First Well-Known Rule\n   3.  Expected Output\n   4. \
    \ Valid Databases\n   The \"Valid Databases\" part contains the transformation\
    \ of an E.164\n   telephone number into a domain name.  Section 2.4 of RFC 3761\
    \ uses\n   the following 4-step algorithm for this:\n   1.  Remove all characters\
    \ with the exception of the digits.\n   2.  Put dots (\".\") between each digit.\n\
    \   3.  Reverse the order of the digits.\n   4.  Append the string \".e164.arpa\"\
    \ to the end.\n   The interim solution for Infrastructure ENUM uses a modified\
    \ version\n   of this algorithm:\n   1.  Determine the proper POSITION parameter\
    \ for this E.164 number\n       according to the algorithm in Section 5 of this\
    \ document.\n   2.  Build an ordered list of single-digit strings from all digits\n\
    \       appearing in the telephone number.  All non-digit characters are\n   \
    \    ignored.\n   3.  Insert a string consisting of \"i\" into this list, after\
    \ POSITION\n       strings.  If the list of strings was shorter than POSITION\n\
    \       elements, then report an error.\n   4.  Reverse the order of the list.\n\
    \   5.  Append the string \"e164.arpa\" to the end of the list.\n   6.  Create\
    \ a single domain name by joining the list together with\n       dots (\".\")\
    \ between each string.\n   This is the only point where the interim Infrastructure\
    \ ENUM (I-ENUM)\n   solution differs from straight RFC 3761 ENUM.  All other parts\
    \ of\n   User ENUM, including the enumservices registrations, apply to I-ENUM\n\
    \   as well.\n"
- title: 5.  Determining the Position of the Branch
  contents:
  - "5.  Determining the Position of the Branch\n   In order to allow for the deployment\
    \ of this interim solution\n   independent of IAB/ITU-T/RIPE-NCC negotiations,\
    \ the branching label\n   \"i\" cannot be inserted in the Tier-0 zone (i.e., the\
    \ e164.arpa zone\n   itself) currently managed by RIPE NCC.  This condition acts\
    \ as a\n   lower bound on the choice of the POSITION parameter.\n   For international\
    \ E.164-numbers for geographic areas (Section 6.2.1\n   of [E164]) and for international\
    \ E.164-numbers for global services\n   (Section 6.2.2 of [E164]), the most sensible\
    \ choice for POSITION is\n   the number of digits in the country code of the number\
    \ in question.\n   This places the branch directly under the country-code level\
    \ within\n   the e164.arpa ENUM tree.\n   For international E.164-number for networks\
    \ (Section 6.2.3 of\n   [E164]), the appropriate choice for POSITION is the combined\
    \ length\n   of the CC (Country Code) and IC (Identification Code) fields.\n \
    \  For international E.164-number for groups of countries (Section 6.2.4\n   of\
    \ [E164]), the value for POSITION is 4.\n   The authoritative source for up-to-date\
    \ country code and network\n   Identification Code allocations is published by\
    \ the ITU-T as a\n   complement to the recommendation E.164 [E164].  The current\
    \ version\n   of this complement is available from the ITU website under \"ITU-T\
    \ /\n   Service Publications\".\n   Please note that country code 1 of the North\
    \ American Numbering Plan\n   (NANP) does not fall under the ITU classification\
    \ of \"groups of\n   countries\", but is a \"shared country code\" for a geographic\
    \ area.\n   Thus, the POSITION parameter for the NANP is 1.\n   As of 2007, the\
    \ POSITION value for a specific E.164 number can be\n   determined with the following\
    \ algorithm:\n   o  If the number starts with 1 or 7, then POSITION is 1.\n  \
    \ o  If the number is in one of the following 2-digit country codes,\n      then\
    \ POSITION is 2: 20, 27, 30-34, 36, 39, 40, 41, 43-49, 51-58,\n      60-66, 81,\
    \ 82, 84, 86, 90-95, or 98.\n   o  If the number starts with 388 or 881, then\
    \ POSITION is 4.\n   o  If the number starts with 878 or 882, then POSITION is\
    \ 5.\n   o  If the number starts with 883 and the next digit is < 5, then\n  \
    \    POSITION is 6.\n   o  If the number starts with 883 and the next digit is\
    \ >= 5, then\n      POSITION is 7.\n   o  In all other cases, POSITION is 3.\n\
    \   Given the fact that the ITU-T recently allocated only 3-digit country\n  \
    \ codes, there are no more spare 1- and 2-digit country codes and\n   existing\
    \ 1- and 2-digit country codes are extremely unlikely to be\n   recovered, the\
    \ above list of existing 1- and 2-digit country codes\n   can be considered very\
    \ stable.  The only problem may be for a country\n   that has split, as happened\
    \ recently, for example, to Yugoslavia.\n   Regarding network codes, up to 2007,\
    \ the ITU-T has only allocated 1-\n   and 2-digit ICs.  Assignments of 3- and\
    \ 4-digit ICs started in May\n   2007 in the +883 country code.  Any further change\
    \ in the ITU-T\n   policy in this respect will need to be reflected in the above\n\
    \   algorithm.\n"
- title: 6.  Transition to the Long-Term Solution
  contents:
  - "6.  Transition to the Long-Term Solution\n   The proposed long-term solution\
    \ for Infrastructure ENUM [RFC5526] is\n   the establishment of a new zone apex\
    \ for that tree.  This apex will\n   play the same role as \"e164.arpa\" does\
    \ for User ENUM.\n   It is unrealistic to assume that all countries and all ENUM\
    \ clients\n   will manage to migrate from the interim solution to the long-term\n\
    \   solution at a single point in time.  It is thus necessary to plan for\n  \
    \ an incremental transition.\n   In order to achieve this, clients using the interim\
    \ solution need to\n   be redirected to the long-term I-ENUM tree for all country\
    \ codes that\n   have already switched to the long-term solution.  This SHOULD\
    \ be done\n   by placing DNAME [RFC2672] records at the branch (the \"i\") label\n\
    \   pointing to the appropriate domain name in the long-term I-ENUM tree.\n  \
    \ All descendants at that branch label location where the DNAME record\n   is\
    \ inserted MUST be removed, as required by Section 3 of RFC 2672.\n   Therefore,\
    \ ALL entities involved in making or answering DNS queries\n   for I-ENUM MUST\
    \ fully support the DNAME record type and its\n   semantics.  In particular, entities\
    \ involved in I-ENUM lookups MUST\n   correctly handle responses containing synthesized\
    \ CNAMEs that may be\n   generated as a consequence of DNAME processing by any\
    \ other element\n   in resolution, typically an iterative mode resolving name\
    \ server.\n   These entities MUST also apply adequate measures to detect loops\
    \ and\n   prevent non-terminating resolutions because of improperly configured\n\
    \   DNAME records or combinations of DNAME and CNAME records.\n   Note: Some caching\
    \ name server implementations are known to handle\n   DNAMEs incorrectly.  In\
    \ the worst case, such bugs could stay\n   undetected until a country transitions\
    \ to the long-term solution.\n   Therefore, ensuring full DNAME support from the\
    \ start (and carefully\n   testing that it actually works) is important.\n   The\
    \ domain name for the branch location and its DNAME record SHOULD\n   be removed\
    \ once the transition to the long-term solution is completed\n   and all entities\
    \ involved in I-ENUM have migrated to the new zone\n   apex for I-ENUM.\n"
- title: 7.  Examples

    \ as the new apex for I-ENUM,\n   the administrators of +44 can implement a smooth\
    \ transition by\n   putting the following DNAME record in their zone:\n   i.4.4.e164.arpa.\
    \    IN DNAME 4.4.ienum.example.net.\n   This way, clients using the interim I-ENUM\
    \ solution end up querying\n   the same tree as clients implementing the long-term\
    \ solution.\n"
- title: 8.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "8.  Security Considerations\n   Privacy issues have been raised regarding the\
    \ unwarranted disclosure\n   of user information that would result from publishing\
    \ Infrastructure\n   ENUM information in the public DNS.  For instance, such disclosure\n\
    \   could be used for harvesting numbers in service or obtaining unlisted\n  \
    \ numbers.\n   Given that number-range allocation is public information, we believe\n\
    \   the easiest way to cope with such concerns is to fully unroll\n   allocated\
    \ number ranges in the Infrastructure ENUM subtree, wherever\n   such privacy\
    \ concerns exist.  Whether or not a number is served would\n   be exposed by the\
    \ carrier-of-record when an attempt is made to\n   contact the corresponding URI.\
    \  We assume this to be an authenticated\n   operation, which would not leak information\
    \ to unauthorized parties.\n   Entering all numbers in an allocated number range,\
    \ whether serviced\n   or not, or whether listed or unlisted, will prevent mining\
    \ attempts\n   for such number attributes.\n   The result will be that the information\
    \ in the public DNS will mirror\n   number-range allocation information, but no\
    \ more.  Infrastructure\n   ENUM will not tell you more than you can get by just\
    \ dialing numbers.\n   The URI pointing to the destination network of the carrier-of-record\n\
    \   should also not disclose any privacy information about the identity\n   of\
    \ the end-user.  It is therefore recommended to use either\n   anonymized UserIDs\
    \ or the E.164 number itself in the user part of the\n   URI, such as in sip:+441632960084@example.com.\n"
