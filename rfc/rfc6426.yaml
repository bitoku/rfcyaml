    \   deployed Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM) mechanism\n   for\
    \ Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) Label Switched Paths\n   (LSPs).  This\

    \ functions in\n   MPLS-TP networks.  Finally, this document updates RFC 4379\

  - "1.1.  Conventions Used in This Document\n   The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\"\
    , \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\"\
    , \"NOT RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and\n   \"OPTIONAL\" in this document are to be\
    \ interpreted as described in\n   [RFC2119].\n   There is considerable opportunity\
    \ for confusion in use of the terms\n   \"on-demand connectivity verification\"\
    \ (CV), \"on-demand route tracing\"\n   and \"LSP ping.\"  In this document, we\
    \ try to use the terms\n   consistently as follows:\n   o  LSP ping: refers to\
    \ the mechanism - particularly as defined and\n      used in referenced material;\n\
    \   o  On-demand CV: refers to on-demand connectivity verification and --\n  \
    \    where both apply equally -- on-demand route tracing, as\n      implemented\
    \ using the LSP ping mechanism extended for support of\n      MPLS-TP;\n   o \
    \ On-demand route tracing: used in those cases where the LSP ping\n      mechanism\
    \ (as extended) is used exclusively for route tracing.\n   From the perspective\
    \ of on-demand CV and route tracing, we use the\n   concepts of \"Requester\"\
    \ and \"Responder\" as follows:\n   o  Requester: Originator of an OAM Request\
    \ message,\n   o  Responder: Entity responding to an OAM Request message.\n  \
    \ Since, in this document, all messages are assumed to be carried in an\n   LSP,\
    \ all Request messages would be injected at the ingress to an LSP.\n   A Responder\
    \ might or might not be at the egress of this same LSP,\n   given that it could\
    \ receive Request messages as a result of time-to-\n   live (TTL) expiry.  If\
    \ a Reply is to be delivered via a reverse-path\n   LSP, the message would again\
    \ be inserted at the ingress of that LSP.\n"
- title: 1.2.  On-Demand CV for MPLS-TP LSPs Using IP Encapsulation
  contents:
  - "1.2.  On-Demand CV for MPLS-TP LSPs Using IP Encapsulation\n   LSP ping requires\
    \ IP addressing on responding Label Switching Routers\n   (LSRs) for performing\
    \ OAM on MPLS-signaled LSPs and pseudowires.  In\n   particular, in these cases,\
    \ LSP ping packets generated by a Requester\n   are encapsulated in an IP/UDP\
    \ header with the destination address\n   from the 127/8 range and then encapsulated\
    \ in the MPLS label stack\n   ([RFC4379] , [RFC5884]).  A Responder uses the presence\
    \ of the 127/8\n   destination address to identify OAM packets and relies further\
    \ on the\n   UDP port number to determine whether the packet is an LSP ping\n\
    \   packet.  It is to be noted that this determination does not require\n   IP\
    \ forwarding capabilities.  It requires the presence of an IP host\n   stack,\
    \ which enables responding LSRs to process packets with a\n   destination address\
    \ from the 127/8 range.  [RFC1122] allocates the\n   127/8 range as \"Internal\
    \ host loopback address\" and [RFC1812] states\n   that \"a router SHOULD NOT\
    \ forward, except over a loopback interface,\n   any packet that has a destination\
    \ address on network 127\".\n"

  contents:
  - "1.3.  On-Demand CV for MPLS-TP LSPs Using Non-IP Encapsulation\n   In certain\
    \ MPLS-TP deployment scenarios, IP addressing might not be\n   available or use\
    \ some form of non-IP encapsulation might be preferred\n   for on-demand CV, route\
    \ tracing, and BFD packets.  In such scenarios,\n   on-demand CV and/or route\
    \ tracing SHOULD be run without IP\n   addressing, using the Associated Channel\
    \ (ACH) channel type specified\n   in Section 3.\n   Section 3.3 and Section 4.2\

  contents:
  - "2.1.  New Address Type for Downstream Mapping TLV\n   [RFC4379] defines the Downstream\
    \ Mapping (DSMAP) TLV.  [RFC6424]\n   further defines the Downstream Detailed\
    \ Mapping (DDMAP) TLV.  This\n   document defines the following new address type,\
    \ which MAY be used in\n   any DSMAP or DDMAP TLV included in an on-demand CV\
    \ message:\n               Type #        Address Type           K Octets\n   \

    \ Mapping Address Type\n   The new address type indicates that no address is present\
    \ in the\n   DSMAP or DDMAP TLV.  However, IF_Num information (see definition\
    \ of\n   \"IF_Num\" in [RFC6370]) for both ingress and egress interfaces, as\n\
    \   well as Multipath Information, is included in the format and MAY be\n   present.\n\
    \   IF_Num values of zero indicate that no IF_Num applies in the field in\n  \
    \ which this value appears.\n   The Multipath Type SHOULD be set to zero (no multipath)\
    \ when using\n   this address type.\n   When this address type is used, on receipt\
    \ of an LSP ping echo\n   request, interface verification MUST be bypassed.  Thus,\
    \ the\n   receiving node SHOULD only perform MPLS label control-plane/\n   data-plane\
    \ consistency checks.  Note that these consistency checks\n   include checking\
    \ the included identifier information.\n   The new address type is also applicable\
    \ to the Detailed Downstream\n   Mapping (DDMAP) TLV defined in [RFC6424].\n"

- title: 7.5.  New Downstream Mapping Address Type Registry
  contents:
  - "7.5.  New Downstream Mapping Address Type Registry\n   [RFC4379] defined several\
    \ registries.  It also defined some value\n   assignments without explicitly asking\
    \ for IANA to create a registry\n   to support additional value assignments. \
    \ One such case is in\n   defining address types associated with the Downstream\
    \ Mapping (DSMAP)\n   TLV.\n   This document extends RFC 4379 by defining a new\
    \ address type for use\n   with the Downstream Mapping and Downstream Detailed\
    \ Mapping TLVs.\n   Recognizing that the absence of a registry makes it possible\
    \ to have\n   collisions of \"address-type\" usages, IANA has established a new\n\
    \   registry -- associated with both [RFC4379] and this document -- that\n   initially\
    \ allocates the following assignments:\n   Type #     Address Type      K Octets\
    \    Reference\n   ------     ------------      --------    --------------------------\n\
    \        1     IPv4 Numbered           16    RFC 4379\n        2     IPv4 Unnumbered\

    \ Mapping Address Type Registry\n   Because the field in this case is an 8-bit\
    \ field, the allocation\n   policy for this registry is \"Standards Action.\"\n"
