Abstract This document specifies how Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) messages can be transmitted directly over IEEE 802 networks.
This document obsoletes RFC 1089.
This document specifies how Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) messages can be transmitted directly over IEEE 802 networks.
For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the Internet  Standard management framework, please refer to section 7 of RFC 3410 [RFC3410].
This document supplements the standard SNMP transport mappings defined in RFC 3417 [RFC3417].
This document obsoletes RFC 1089.
Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed the Management Information Base or MIB.
MIB objects are generally accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the Structure of Management Information (SMI).
This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58, RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58
, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580

" DESCRIPTION "This MIB module defines the SNMP over IEEE 802 transport mapping.
This version of this MIB module is part of RFC 4789; see the RFC itself for full legal notices."
"The SNMP over IEEE 802 networks transport domain.
The corresponding transport address is of type MacAddress as defined in the SNMPv2 TC module (RFC 2579).
SNMP over IEEE 802 Networks
This is an optional transport mapping.
The need to carry SNMP directly over an 802 LAN transport in order to allow for the management of simple devices was identified in applications like the Two Port Media Access Control (MAC) Relay, which is being developed in IEEE 802.1 as project P802.1aj [802.1aj].
SNMP over IEEE 802 networks has some inherent restrictions.
Using the SNMP over IEEE 802 transport mapping
restricts messages to a single logical IEEE 802 LAN, bridged LAN or VLAN.
Furthermore, only a single SNMP engine can be addressed on a given IEEE 802 network interface.
In particular, command generators and notification receivers, as well as command responders and notification originators, must share a single transport endpoint.
Serialization SNMP messages are serialized, as described in Section 8 of RFC 3417
The resulting serialized message is shipped in the data portion of an IEEE LAN MAC frame.
SNMP messages are sent in IEEE 802.3 frames with an Ethernet type field of 33100 (hexadecimal 814C).
When serialized SNMP messages are sent in IEEE 802.3 frames (and in other IEEE 802 MAC frame types that can natively represent Ethernet type values), an Ethernet type field value of 33100 (hexadecimal 814C) MUST be used as the link layer protocol identifier.
In IEEE 802 LANs that use LLC as the means of link layer protocol identification, such as IEEE 802.11 Wireless LANs, the SNAP encapsulation method described in subclause 10.5 "Encapsulation of Ethernet frames over LLC" in [IEEE802] MUST be used.
When an SNMP entity uses this transport mapping, it MUST be capable of accepting SNMP messages up to and including 484 octets in size.
It is RECOMMENDED that implementations be capable of accepting messages of up to 1472 octets in size.
Implementation of larger values is encouraged whenever possible.
Relationship to Other MIB Modules
Several core SNMP MIB modules use TDomain/TAddress pairs to identify SNMP transport endpoints.
The SNMP TARGET MIB [RFC3413] uses TDomain
/TAddress pairs to identify targets that can be used as notification receivers.
TAddress pairs are used by the NOTIFICATION LOG MIB [RFC3014] to record the source from which a notification was received.
The ENTITY MIB [RFC4133] uses TDomain/ TAddress pairs to provide the transport endpoint of logical entities.
The MIB module contained in this document introduces the object identifier constant snmpIeee802Domain.
This constant can be assigned to an object of type TDomain to identify an SNMP over IEEE 802 endpoint, in which case the corresponding TAddress will have a value that conforms to the MacAddress textual convention.
By providing these definitions, it is possible to use the generic MIB modules to refer to SNMP over IEEE 802 endpoints.
IANA Considerations IANA made a MIB OID assignment under the snmpModules branch for the SNMP IEEE802 TM MIB module.
IANA assigned an OID value below snmpDomains for the transport domain.
This first required the setup of a registry for OIDs under snmpDomains.
At the point of this writing, the following assignments already exist: Prefix: iso.org.dod.internet.snmpv2.snmpDomains (1.3.6.1.6.1)
The following assigment has been made:
SNMP over IEEE 802    RFC 4789
For new assignments, a specification is required as per [RFC2434].
This module does not define any management objects.
Instead, it defines an OBJECT IDENTIFIER which may be used by other MIB modules to identify an SNMP transport mapping.
Meaningful security considerations can only be written in the MIB modules that define management objects.
The MIB module in this document has therefore no impact on the security of the Internet.
SNMPv1 and SNMPv2c messages are not considered secure.
It is recommended that the implementors consider the use of SNMPv3 messages and the security features as provided by the SNMPv3 framework.
Specifically, the use of the User based Security Model STD 62, RFC 3414 [RFC3414] and the View based Access Control Model STD 62, RFC 3415 [RFC3415] is recommended.
It is then a customer/user responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to a MIB is properly configured to give access to the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate rights to indeed GET or SET
