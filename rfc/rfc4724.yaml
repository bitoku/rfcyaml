- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   Usually, when BGP on a router restarts, all the BGP peers\
    \ detect that\n   the session went down and then came up.  This \"down/up\" transition\n\
    \   results in a \"routing flap\" and causes BGP route re-computation,\n   generation\
    \ of BGP routing updates, and unnecessary churn to the\n   forwarding tables.\
    \  It could spread across multiple routing domains.\n   Such routing flaps may\
    \ create transient forwarding blackholes and/or\n   transient forwarding loops.\
    \  They also consume resources on the\n   control plane of the routers affected\
    \ by the flap.  As such, they are\n   detrimental to the overall network performance.\n\
    \   This document describes a mechanism for BGP that would help minimize\n   the\
    \ negative effects on routing caused by BGP restart.  An End-of-RIB\n   marker\
    \ is specified and can be used to convey routing convergence\n   information.\
    \  A new BGP capability, termed \"Graceful Restart\n   Capability\", is defined\
    \ that would allow a BGP speaker to express its\n   ability to preserve forwarding\
    \ state during BGP restart.  Finally,\n   procedures are outlined for temporarily\
    \ retaining routing information\n   across a TCP session termination/re-establishment.\n"

- title: 2.  Marker for End-of-RIB
  contents:
  - "2.  Marker for End-of-RIB\n   An UPDATE message with no reachable Network Layer\
    \ Reachability\n   Information (NLRI) and empty withdrawn NLRI is specified as\
    \ the End-\n   of-RIB marker that can be used by a BGP speaker to indicate to\
    \ its\n   peer the completion of the initial routing update after the session\n\
    \   is established.  For the IPv4 unicast address family, the End-of-RIB\n   marker\
    \ is an UPDATE message with the minimum length [BGP-4].  For any\n   other address\
    \ family, it is an UPDATE message that contains only the\n   MP_UNREACH_NLRI attribute\
    \ [BGP-MP] with no withdrawn routes for that\n   <AFI, SAFI>.\n   Although the\
    \ End-of-RIB marker is specified for the purpose of BGP\n   graceful restart,\
    \ it is noted that the generation of such a marker\n   upon completion of the\
    \ initial update would be useful for routing\n   convergence in general, and thus\
    \ the practice is recommended.\n   In addition, it would be beneficial for routing\
    \ convergence if a BGP\n   speaker can indicate to its peer up-front that it will\
    \ generate the\n   End-of-RIB marker, regardless of its ability to preserve its\n\
    \   forwarding state during BGP restart.  This can be accomplished using\n   the\
    \ Graceful Restart Capability described in the next section.\n"
- title: 3.  Graceful Restart Capability
  contents:
  - "3.  Graceful Restart Capability\n   The Graceful Restart Capability is a new\
    \ BGP capability [BGP-CAP]\n   that can be used by a BGP speaker to indicate its\
    \ ability to preserve\n   its forwarding state during BGP restart.  It can also\
    \ be used to\n   convey to its peer its intention of generating the End-of-RIB\
    \ marker\n   upon the completion of its initial routing updates.\n   This capability\
    \ is defined as follows:\n      Capability code: 64\n      Capability length:\
    \ variable\n      Capability value: Consists of the \"Restart Flags\" field, \"\

    \   The use and meaning of the fields are as follows:\n      Restart Flags:\n\

    \ 2 3\n            +-+-+-+-+\n            |R|Resv.|\n            +-+-+-+-+\n \
    \        The most significant bit is defined as the Restart State (R)\n      \
    \   bit, which can be used to avoid possible deadlock caused by\n         waiting\
    \ for the End-of-RIB marker when multiple BGP speakers\n         peering with\
    \ each other restart.  When set (value 1), this bit\n         indicates that the\
    \ BGP speaker has restarted, and its peer MUST\n         NOT wait for the End-of-RIB\
    \ marker from the speaker before\n         advertising routing information to\
    \ the speaker.\n         The remaining bits are reserved and MUST be set to zero\
    \ by the\n         sender and ignored by the receiver.\n      Restart Time:\n\
    \         This is the estimated time (in seconds) it will take for the\n     \
    \    BGP session to be re-established after a restart.  This can be\n        \
    \ used to speed up routing convergence by its peer in case that\n         the\
    \ BGP speaker does not come back after a restart.\n      Address Family Identifier\
    \ (AFI), Subsequent Address Family\n         Identifier (SAFI):\n         The\
    \ AFI and SAFI, taken in combination, indicate that Graceful\n         Restart\
    \ is supported for routes that are advertised with the\n         same AFI and\
    \ SAFI.  Routes may be explicitly associated with a\n         particular AFI and\
    \ SAFI using the encoding of [BGP-MP] or\n         implicitly associated with\
    \ <AFI=IPv4, SAFI=Unicast> if using\n         the encoding of [BGP-4].\n     \
    \ Flags for Address Family:\n         This field contains bit flags relating to\
    \ routes that were\n         advertised with the given AFI and SAFI.\n       \

    \  |\n            +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+\n         The most significant bit is defined\
    \ as the Forwarding State (F)\n         bit, which can be used to indicate whether\
    \ the forwarding state\n         for routes that were advertised with the given\
    \ AFI and SAFI has\n         indeed been preserved during the previous BGP restart.\
    \  When\n         set (value 1), the bit indicates that the forwarding state has\n\
    \         been preserved.\n         The remaining bits are reserved and MUST be\
    \ set to zero by the\n         sender and ignored by the receiver.\n   When a\
    \ sender of this capability does not include any <AFI, SAFI> in\n   the capability,\
    \ it means that the sender is not capable of preserving\n   its forwarding state\
    \ during BGP restart, but supports procedures for\n   the Receiving Speaker (as\
    \ defined in Section 4.2 of this document).\n   In that case, the value of the\
    \ \"Restart Time\" field advertised by the\n   sender is irrelevant.\n   A BGP\
    \ speaker MUST NOT include more than one instance of the Graceful\n   Restart\
    \ Capability in the capability advertisement [BGP-CAP].  If\n   more than one\
    \ instance of the Graceful Restart Capability is carried\n   in the capability\
    \ advertisement, the receiver of the advertisement\n   MUST ignore all but the\
    \ last instance of the Graceful Restart\n   Capability.\n   Including <AFI=IPv4,\
    \ SAFI=unicast> in the Graceful Restart Capability\n   does not imply that the\
    \ IPv4 unicast routing information should be\n   carried by using the BGP multiprotocol\
    \ extensions [BGP-MP] -- it\n   could be carried in the NLRI field of the BGP\
    \ UPDATE message.\n"
- title: 4.  Operation
  contents:
  - "4.  Operation\n   A BGP speaker MAY advertise the Graceful Restart Capability\
    \ for an\n   address family to its peer if it has the ability to preserve its\n\
    \   forwarding state for the address family when BGP restarts.  In\n   addition,\
    \ even if the speaker does not have the ability to preserve\n   its forwarding\
    \ state for any address family during BGP restart, it is\n   still recommended\
    \ that the speaker advertise the Graceful Restart\n   Capability to its peer (as\
    \ mentioned before this is done by not\n   including any <AFI, SAFI> in the advertised\
    \ capability).  There are\n   two reasons for doing this.  The first is to indicate\
    \ its intention\n   of generating the End-of-RIB marker upon the completion of\
    \ its\n   initial routing updates, as doing this would be useful for routing\n\
    \   convergence in general.  The second is to indicate its support for a\n   peer\
    \ which wishes to perform a graceful restart.\n   The End-of-RIB marker MUST be\
    \ sent by a BGP speaker to its peer once\n   it completes the initial routing\
    \ update (including the case when\n   there is no update to send) for an address\
    \ family after the BGP\n   session is established.\n   It is noted that the normal\
    \ BGP procedures MUST be followed when the\n   TCP session terminates due to the\
    \ sending or receiving of a BGP\n   NOTIFICATION message.\n   A suggested default\
    \ for the Restart Time is a value less than or\n   equal to the HOLDTIME carried\
    \ in the OPEN.\n   In the following sections, \"Restarting Speaker\" refers to\
    \ a router\n   whose BGP has restarted, and \"Receiving Speaker\" refers to a\
    \ router\n   that peers with the restarting speaker.\n   Consider that the Graceful\
    \ Restart Capability for an address family\n   is advertised by the Restarting\
    \ Speaker, and is understood by the\n   Receiving Speaker, and a BGP session between\
    \ them is established.\n   The following sections detail the procedures that MUST\
    \ be followed by\n   the Restarting Speaker as well as the Receiving Speaker once\
    \ the\n   Restarting Speaker restarts.\n"
- title: 4.1.  Procedures for the Restarting Speaker
  contents:
  - "4.1.  Procedures for the Restarting Speaker\n   When the Restarting Speaker restarts,\
    \ it MUST retain, if possible,\n   the forwarding state for the BGP routes in\
    \ the Loc-RIB and MUST mark\n   them as stale.  It MUST NOT differentiate between\
    \ stale and other\n   information during forwarding.\n   To re-establish the session\
    \ with its peer, the Restarting Speaker\n   MUST set the \"Restart State\" bit\
    \ in the Graceful Restart Capability\n   of the OPEN message.  Unless allowed\
    \ via configuration, the\n   \"Forwarding State\" bit for an address family in\
    \ the capability can be\n   set only if the forwarding state has indeed been preserved\
    \ for that\n   address family during the restart.\n   Once the session between\
    \ the Restarting Speaker and the Receiving\n   Speaker is re-established, the\
    \ Restarting Speaker will receive and\n   process BGP messages from its peers.\
    \  However, it MUST defer route\n   selection for an address family until it either\
    \ (a) receives the\n   End-of-RIB marker from all its peers (excluding the ones\
    \ with the\n   \"Restart State\" bit set in the received capability and excluding\
    \ the\n   ones that do not advertise the graceful restart capability) or (b)\n\
    \   the Selection_Deferral_Timer referred to below has expired.  It is\n   noted\
    \ that prior to route selection, the speaker has no routes to\n   advertise to\
    \ its peers and no routes to update the forwarding state.\n   In situations where\
    \ both Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP) and BGP have\n   restarted, it might be\
    \ advantageous to wait for IGP to converge\n   before the BGP speaker performs\
    \ route selection.\n   After the BGP speaker performs route selection, the forwarding\
    \ state\n   of the speaker MUST be updated and any previously marked stale\n \
    \  information MUST be removed.  The Adj-RIB-Out can then be advertised\n   to\
    \ its peers.  Once the initial update is complete for an address\n   family (including\
    \ the case that there is no routing update to send),\n   the End-of-RIB marker\
    \ MUST be sent.\n   To put an upper bound on the amount of time a router defers\
    \ its route\n   selection, an implementation MUST support a (configurable) timer\
    \ that\n   imposes this upper bound.  This timer is referred to as the\n   \"\
    Selection_Deferral_Timer\".  The value of this timer should be large\n   enough,\
    \ so as to provide all the peers of the Restarting Speaker with\n   enough time\
    \ to send all the routes to the Restarting Speaker.\n   If one wants to apply\
    \ graceful restart only when the restart is\n   planned (as opposed to both planned\
    \ and unplanned restart), then one\n   way to accomplish this would be to set\
    \ the Forwarding State bit to 1\n   after a planned restart, and to 0 in all other\
    \ cases.  Other\n   approaches to accomplish this are outside the scope of this\
    \ document.\n"
- title: 4.2.  Procedures for the Receiving Speaker
  contents:
  - "4.2.  Procedures for the Receiving Speaker\n   When the Restarting Speaker restarts,\
    \ the Receiving Speaker may or\n   may not detect the termination of the TCP session\
    \ with the Restarting\n   Speaker, depending on the underlying TCP implementation,\
    \ whether or\n   not [BGP-AUTH] is in use, and the specific circumstances of the\n\
    \   restart.  In case it does not detect the termination of the old TCP\n   session\
    \ and still considers the BGP session as being established, it\n   MUST treat\
    \ the subsequent open connection from the peer as an\n   indication of the termination\
    \ of the old TCP session and act\n   accordingly (when the Graceful Restart Capability\
    \ has been received\n   from the peer).  See Section 8 for a description of this\
    \ behavior in\n   terms of the BGP finite state machine.\n   \"Acting accordingly\"\
    \ in this context means that the previous TCP\n   session MUST be closed, and\
    \ the new one retained.  Note that this\n   behavior differs from the default\
    \ behavior, as specified in [BGP-4],\n   Section 6.8.  Since the previous connection\
    \ is considered to be\n   terminated, no NOTIFICATION message should be sent --\
    \ the previous\n   TCP session is simply closed.\n   When the Receiving Speaker\
    \ detects termination of the TCP session for\n   a BGP session with a peer that\
    \ has advertised the Graceful Restart\n   Capability, it MUST retain the routes\
    \ received from the peer for all\n   the address families that were previously\
    \ received in the Graceful\n   Restart Capability and MUST mark them as stale\
    \ routing information.\n   To deal with possible consecutive restarts, a route\
    \ (from the peer)\n   previously marked as stale MUST be deleted.  The router\
    \ MUST NOT\n   differentiate between stale and other routing information during\n\
    \   forwarding.\n   In re-establishing the session, the \"Restart State\" bit\
    \ in the\n   Graceful Restart Capability of the OPEN message sent by the Receiving\n\
    \   Speaker MUST NOT be set unless the Receiving Speaker has restarted.\n   The\
    \ presence and the setting of the \"Forwarding State\" bit for an\n   address\
    \ family depend upon the actual forwarding state and\n   configuration.\n   If\
    \ the session does not get re-established within the \"Restart Time\"\n   that\
    \ the peer advertised previously, the Receiving Speaker MUST\n   delete all the\
    \ stale routes from the peer that it is retaining.\n   A BGP speaker could have\
    \ some way of determining whether its peer's\n   forwarding state is still viable,\
    \ for example through Bidirectional\n   Forwarding Detection [BFD] or through\
    \ monitoring layer two\n   information.  Specifics of such mechanisms are beyond\
    \ the scope of\n   this document.  In the event that it determines that its peer's\n\
    \   forwarding state is not viable prior to the re-establishment of the\n   session,\
    \ the speaker MAY delete all the stale routes from the peer\n   that it is retaining.\n\
    \   Once the session is re-established, if the \"Forwarding State\" bit for\n\
    \   a specific address family is not set in the newly received Graceful\n   Restart\
    \ Capability, or if a specific address family is not included\n   in the newly\
    \ received Graceful Restart Capability, or if the Graceful\n   Restart Capability\
    \ is not received in the re-established session at\n   all, then the Receiving\
    \ Speaker MUST immediately remove all the stale\n   routes from the peer that\
    \ it is retaining for that address family.\n   The Receiving Speaker MUST send\
    \ the End-of-RIB marker once it\n   completes the initial update for an address\
    \ family (including the\n   case that it has no routes to send) to the peer.\n\
    \   The Receiving Speaker MUST replace the stale routes by the routing\n   updates\
    \ received from the peer.  Once the End-of-RIB marker for an\n   address family\
    \ is received from the peer, it MUST immediately remove\n   any routes from the\
    \ peer that are still marked as stale for that\n   address family.\n   To put\
    \ an upper bound on the amount of time a router retains the\n   stale routes,\
    \ an implementation MAY support a (configurable) timer\n   that imposes this upper\
    \ bound.\n"

- title: 6.  Deployment Considerations
  contents:
  - "6.  Deployment Considerations\n   Although the procedures described in this document\
    \ would help\n   minimize the effect of routing flaps, it is noted that when a\
    \ BGP\n   Graceful Restart-capable router restarts, or if it restarts without\n\
    \   preserving its forwarding state (e.g., due to a power failure), there\n  \
    \ is a potential for transient routing loops or blackholes in the\n   network\
    \ if routing information changes before the involved routers\n   complete routing\
    \ updates and convergence.  Also, depending on the\n   network topology, if not\
    \ all IBGP speakers are Graceful Restart\n   capable, there could be an increased\
    \ exposure to transient routing\n   loops or blackholes when the Graceful Restart\
    \ procedures are\n   exercised.\n   The Restart Time, the upper bound for retaining\
    \ routes, and the upper\n   bound for deferring route selection may need to be\
    \ tuned as more\n   deployment experience is gained.\n   Finally, it is noted\
    \ that the benefits of deploying BGP Graceful\n   Restart in an Autonomous System\
    \ (AS) whose IGPs and BGP are tightly\n   coupled (i.e., BGP and IGPs would both\
    \ restart) and IGPs have no\n   similar Graceful Restart Capability are reduced\
    \ relative to the\n   scenario where IGPs do have similar Graceful Restart Capability.\n"
- title: 7.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "7.  Security Considerations\n   Since with this proposal a new connection can\
    \ cause an old one to be\n   terminated, it might seem to open the door to denial\
    \ of service\n   attacks.  However, it is noted that unauthenticated BGP is already\n\
    \   known to be vulnerable to denials of service through attacks on the\n   TCP\
    \ transport.  The TCP transport is commonly protected through use\n   of [BGP-AUTH].\
    \  Such authentication will equally protect against\n   denials of service through\
    \ spurious new connections.\n   If an attacker is able to successfully open a\
    \ TCP connection\n   impersonating a legitimate peer, the attacker's connection\
    \ will\n   replace the legitimate one, potentially enabling the attacker to\n\
    \   advertise bogus routes.  We note, however, that the window for such a\n  \
    \ route insertion attack is small since through normal operation of the\n   protocol\
    \ the legitimate peer would open a new connection, in turn\n   causing the attacker's\
    \ connection to be terminated.  Thus, this\n   attack devolves to a form of denial\
    \ of service.\n   It is thus concluded that this proposal does not change the\n\
    \   underlying security model (and issues) of BGP-4.\n   We also note that implementations\
    \ may allow use of graceful restart\n   to be controlled by configuration.  If\
    \ graceful restart is not\n   enabled, naturally the underlying security model\
    \ of BGP-4 is\n   unchanged.\n"
