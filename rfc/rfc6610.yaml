    \   of Mobile IPv6 home network information.  New DHCP options are\n   defined\
    \ that allow a mobile node to request the home agent IP\n   address, Fully Qualified\
    \ Domain Name (FQDN), or home network prefix\n   and obtain it via the DHCP response.\n"

  - "1.  Introduction\n   Before a mobile node can engage in Mobile IPv6 signaling\
    \ with a home\n   agent, it should either know the IP address of the home agent\
    \ via\n   pre-configuration or dynamically discover it.  The Mobile IPv6\n   specification\
    \ [RFC6275] describes how home agents can be dynamically\n   discovered by mobile\
    \ nodes that know the home network prefix.  This\n   scheme does not work when\
    \ prefix information is not already available\n   to the mobile node.  This document\
    \ specifies extensions to DHCPv6\n   [RFC3736] [RFC3315] to deliver the home agent\
    \ information to the\n   mobile node in the form of the IP address of the home\
    \ agent or the\n   Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) [RFC1035] of the home agent.\
    \  The\n   information delivered to the mobile node may also include the home\n\
    \   prefix for the mobile node.  The solution involves defining new DHCP\n   options\
    \ to carry home network prefixes, home agent IP addresses, and\n   FQDN information.\
    \  The mobile node MAY also use the home prefix to\n   discover the list of home\
    \ agents serving the home prefix using the\n   Dynamic Home Agent Address Discovery\
    \ mechanism specified in\n   [RFC6275].\n   As part of configuring the initial\
    \ TCP/IP parameters, a mobile node\n   can find itself a suitable home agent.\
    \  Such a home agent might\n   reside in the access network to which the mobile\
    \ node connects or in\n   a home network with which the mobile node is associated.\
    \  A mobile\n   node can indicate its home network identity when roaming to a\
    \ visited\n   network in order to obtain the MIPv6 bootstrap parameters from the\n\
    \   home network.  As an example, the visited network may determine the\n   home\
    \ network of the mobile node based on the realm portion of the NAI\n   (Network\
    \ Access Identifier) [RFC4282] used in access authentication\n   [RFC5447].\n\
    \   The mobile node may or may not be connected to the \"home\" network\n   when\
    \ it attempts to learn Mobile IPv6 home network information.  This\n   allows\
    \ operators to centrally deploy home agents while being able to\n   bootstrap\
    \ mobile nodes that are already roaming.  This scenario also\n   occurs when Hierarchical\
    \ Mobile IPv6 (HMIPv6) [RFC5380] is used,\n   where the mobile node is required\
    \ to discover the MAP (a special home\n   agent) that is located multiple hops\
    \ away from the mobile node's\n   attachment point.\n"

    , \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and\
    \ \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].\n\
    \   General mobility terminology can be found in [RFC3753].  The\n   following\
    \ additional terms, as defined in [RFC4640], are used in this\n   document:\n\
    \   Access Service Provider (ASP):  A network operator that provides\n      direct\
    \ IP packet forwarding to and from the mobile node.\n   Mobility Service Provider\
    \ (MSP):  A service provider that provides\n      Mobile IPv6 service.  In order\
    \ to obtain such service, the mobile\n      node must be authenticated and authorized\
    \ to use the Mobile IPv6\n      service.\n   Mobility Service Authorizer (MSA):\
    \  A service provider that\n      authorizes Mobile IPv6 service.\n"

  - "3.  DHCP Options for Home Network/Agent Dynamic Discovery\n   This section introduces\
    \ new DHCP options that are used for dynamic\n   discovery of the home agent's\
    \ IPv6 address, IPv6 home network prefix,\n   or FQDN information in Mobile IPv6.\
    \  Transport to a home agent over\n   IPv4 is also supported by specifying an\
    \ IPv4-Embedded IPv6 address.\n   The detailed procedures are described in Section\
    \ 2.3.2 of \"Mobile\n   IPv6 Support for Dual Stack Hosts and Routers\" [RFC5555].\n\
    \   The names of options listed in this section all start with MIPv6, in\n   order\
    \ to differentiate them from other DHCP options that might have\n   similar names.\
    \  However, throughout the rest of this document, the\n   options are referred\

    \ options in\n   every message they send to the DHCP server.\n   Mobile nodes\

    \ configuration from some exchanges, but SHOULD\n   reconfigure whenever a change\
    \ in the attached network is detected.\n   If the DHCP server responds to a MIPv6-related\
    \ stateless\n   configuration request with an Information Request Timer option,\
    \ the\n   mobile node SHOULD attempt to reconfigure when the IRT expires.\n  \
    \ A mobile node using stateless configuration may try to perform home\n   network\

    \ interested in being configured with\n   MIPv6 home agent information by requesting\
    \ one or more of the three\n   Home Network Information options: the Visited Home\
    \ Network\n   Information option, the Identified Home Network Information option,\n\
    \   or the Unrestricted Home Network Information option.  To request\n   these\
    \ options, the client lists them in the Option Request Option\n   (ORO).  A client\
    \ that requests any of these three options in the ORO\n   MUST also request the\
    \ Home Network Identifier FQDN option, the Home\n   Network Prefix option, the\
    \ Home Agent Address option, and the Home\n   Agent FQDN option.\n   If the mobile\
    \ node requests the Visited Home Network Information\n   option, this indicates\
    \ that it is interested in learning the home\n   network information that pertains\
    \ to the currently visited network.\n   This type can be used to discover local\
    \ home agents in the local ASP.\n   If the mobile node requests the Identified\
    \ Home Network Information\n   option, this indicates that it is interested in\
    \ learning the home\n   network information that pertains to a specified realm.\
    \  This type\n   can be used to discover home agents that are hosted by a user's\
    \ home\n   domain or by any target domain.  A mobile node requesting the\n   Identified\
    \ Home Network Information option MUST include a Client Home\n   Network ID FQDN\
    \ option identifying the MSP being identified.  The\n   target MSP can be a mobile\
    \ node's home MSP or any MSP that has a\n   trusted roaming relationship with\
    \ the mobile node's MSA.\n   If the mobile node has no preference as to the home\
    \ network with\n   which it should be configured, it SHOULD request the Unrestricted\n\
    \   Home Network Information option, and SHOULD NOT request either the\n   Visited\
    \ Home Network Information option or the Identified Home\n   Network Information\
    \ option.\n   A client that wishes to be configured with both the Visited Home\n\
    \   Network Information option and the Identified Home Network\n   Information\
    \ option may request both options in the Option Request\n   Option.  A client\
    \ may request information about more than one\n   identified domain by requesting\
    \ the Identified Home Network\n   Information option in the ORO and including\
    \ more than one Home\n   Network ID FQDN option.  A client that sends more than\
    \ one Home\n   Network ID FQDN option MUST request the Home Network ID option\

- title: 4.1.2.  Processing MIPv6 Configuration Information
  contents:

    \ information for\n   all targeted domains, or, indeed, for any.  If a misconfigured\

    \   contain a Home Network ID FQDN option corresponding to one that the\n   client\
    \ requested, the client MUST silently discard that Identified\n   Home Network\
    \ Information option.\n   If any of the three Home Network Information options\
    \ is returned,\n   configuration information will be included within it.  The\
    \ client\n   must be prepared to handle home agent addresses in the form of either\n\
    \   the Home Agent Address option or the Home Agent FQDN option.\n   If the client\
    \ finds an IPv4-Embedded IPv6 address in a Home Agent\n   Address option, it may\

    \ Home Agent Address options, or Home Agent FQDN\n   options that are not encapsulated\
    \ in one of the three types of Home\n   Network Information options, it MUST silently\
    \ discard these options.\n   The DHCP client must pass whatever configuration\
    \ information it\n   receives to the appropriate mobile IP implementation on the\
    \ mobile\n   node.  How this is done, and what the mobile IP implementation on\
    \ the\n   mobile node does with this information, is outside the scope of this\n\

    \ multiple Visited Home Network Information options or Unrestricted\n   Home Network\
    \ Information options of the same type, or with multiple\n   sub-options within\
    \ such an option, the mobile node SHOULD choose the\n   first one that it can\
    \ employ.\n   If the DHCP client on a mobile node receives any Home Network Prefix\n\
    \   options, Home Agent Address option, or Home Agent FQDN option that\n   are\
    \ not contained within Home Network Information options, the DHCP\n   client MUST\

- title: 4.3.  DHCP Server Behavior
  contents:
  - "4.3.  DHCP Server Behavior\n   Generally, DHCP servers can simply be configured\

    \   options, and Unrestricted Home Network Information options.  In the\n   case\
    \ of Visited Home Network Information options and Unrestricted\n   Home Network\
    \ Information options, which clients get what options\n   depends on operator\
    \ configuration.\n   A DHCP server MAY maintain a table of Home Network ID FQDNs.\
    \  For\n   each such FQDN, a server that maintains such a table SHOULD include\n\
    \   an Identified Home Network Information option.  Such a server would\n   look\

    \ in its table, and for each match, include the Identified\n   Home Network Information\
    \ option configured in the table entry for\n   that FQDN.\n   If a DHCP server\
    \ does not implement the Home Network ID FQDN table,\n   or some similar functionality,\
    \ it is an error for the operator to\n   configure it with any Identified Home\
    \ Network Information options.\n   These options could be erroneously forwarded\
    \ to the client, which\n   would have no use for them, and is required to discard\
    \ them.\n   DHCP servers that implement the Home Network ID FQDN table must, when\n\
    \   sending an Identified Home Network Information option to the client,\n   include\
    \ a Home Network ID option within the Identified Home Network\n   Information\
    \ option that identifies the home network for which\n   configuration information\
    \ is being sent.\n   Aside from the Home Network ID FQDN table, the actual behavior\
    \ of the\n   DHCP server with respect to MIPv6 configuration is simply in\n  \
    \ accordance with the DHCPv6 protocol specification [RFC3315] and\n   depends\
    \ on operator configuration.  No special processing is required\n   for Visited\
    \ Home Network Information options or Unrestricted Home\n   Network Information\

- title: 5.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "5.  Security Considerations\n   Secure delivery of home agent and home network\
    \ information from a\n   DHCP server to the mobile node (DHCP client) relies on\
    \ the same\n   security as DHCP.  The particular option defined in this document\n\
    \   does not have additional impact on DHCP security.\n   Aside from the DHCP\
    \ client-to-server interaction, an operator must\n   also ensure secure delivery\
    \ of mobile IP information to the DHCP\n   server.  This is outside the scope\
    \ of DHCP and the newly defined\n   options.\n   The mechanisms in this specification\
    \ could be used by attackers to\n   learn the addresses of home agents in the\
    \ home network or to feed\n   incorrect information to mobile nodes.\n   The ability\
    \ to learn addresses of nodes may be useful to attackers\n   because brute-force\
    \ scanning of the address space is not practical\n   with IPv6.  Thus, they could\
    \ benefit from any means that make mapping\n   the networks easier.  For example,\
    \ if a security threat targeted at\n   routers or even home agents is discovered,\
    \ having a simple mechanism\n   to easily find out possible targets may prove\
    \ to be an additional\n   security risk.\n   Apart from discovering the address(es)\
    \ of home agents, attackers will\n   not be able to learn much from this information,\
    \ and mobile nodes\n   cannot be tricked into using wrong home agents, as the\
    \ actual\n   communication with the home agents employs mutual authentication.\n\
    \   The mechanisms from this specification may also leak interesting\n   information\
    \ about network topology and prefixes to attackers, and\n   where there is no\
    \ security to protect DHCP, even modify this\n   information.  Again, the mobile\
    \ nodes and home agents employ end-to-\n   end security when they communicate\
    \ with each other.  The authentic\n   source of all information is that communication,\
    \ not the information\n   from DHCP.\n   However, attacks against the information\
    \ carried in DHCP may lead to\n   denial of service if mobile nodes are unable\
    \ to connect to any home\n   agent, or choose a home agent that is not the most\
    \ preferred one.\n"
