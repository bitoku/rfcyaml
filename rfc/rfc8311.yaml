  - "1.  Introduction\n   This memo updates RFC 3168 [RFC3168], which specifies Explicit\n\
    \   Congestion Notification (ECN) as an alternative to packet drops for\n   indicating\
    \ network congestion to endpoints.  It relaxes restrictions\n   in RFC 3168 that\
    \ hinder experimentation towards benefits beyond just\n   removal of loss.  This\
    \ memo summarizes the proposed areas of\n   experimentation and updates RFC 3168\
    \ to enable experimentation in\n   these areas.  An Experimental RFC in the IETF\
    \ document stream\n   [RFC4844] is required to take advantage of any of these\
    \ enabling\n   updates.  Putting all of these updates into a single document enables\n\
    \   experimentation to proceed without requiring a standards process\n   exception\
    \ for each Experimental RFC that needs changes to RFC 3168, a\n   Proposed Standard\
    \ RFC.\n   There is no need for this memo to update RFC 3168 to simplify\n   standardization\
    \ of protocols and mechanisms that are documented in\n   Standards Track RFCs,\
    \ as any Standards Track RFC can update RFC 3168\n   directly without either relying\
    \ on updates in this memo or using a\n   standards process exception.\n   In addition,\
    \ this memo makes related updates to the ECN specification\n   for RTP [RFC6679]\
    \ and for three DCCP profiles ([RFC4341], [RFC4342],\n   and [RFC5622]) for the\
    \ same reason.  Each experiment is still\n   required to be documented in one\
    \ or more separate RFCs, but use of\n   Experimental RFCs for this purpose does\
    \ not require a process\n   exception to modify any of these Proposed Standard\
    \ RFCs when the\n   modification falls within the bounds established by this memo\
    \ (RFC\n   5622 is an Experimental RFC; it is modified by this memo for\n   consistency\
    \ with modifications to the other two DCCP RFCs).\n   Some of the anticipated\
    \ experimentation includes use of the ECT(1)\n   codepoint that was dedicated\
    \ to the ECN nonce experiment in RFC 3540\n   [RFC3540].  This memo records the\
    \ conclusion of the ECN nonce\n   experiment and provides the explanation for\
    \ reclassification of RFC\n   3540 from Experimental to Historic in order to enable\
    \ new\n   experimental use of the ECT(1) codepoint.\n"

- title: '2.  ECN Experimentation: Overview'
  contents:
  - "2.  ECN Experimentation: Overview\n   Three areas of ECN experimentation are\
    \ covered by this memo; the\n   cited documents should be consulted for the detailed\
    \ goals and\n   rationale of each proposed experiment:\n   Congestion Response\
    \ Differences:  An ECN congestion indication\n      communicates a higher likelihood\
    \ than a dropped packet that a\n      short queue exists at the network bottleneck\
    \ node [TCP-ABE].  This\n      difference suggests that for congestion indicated\
    \ by ECN, a\n      different sender congestion response (e.g., sender backs off\
    \ by a\n      smaller amount) may be appropriate by comparison to the sender\n\
    \      response to congestion indicated by loss.  Two examples of\n      proposed\
    \ sender congestion response changes are described in\n      [TCP-ABE] and [ECN-L4S]\
    \ -- the proposal in the latter document\n      couples the sender congestion\
    \ response change to Congestion\n      Marking Differences functionality (see\
    \ next paragraph).  These\n      changes are at variance with the requirement\
    \ in RFC 3168 that a\n      sender's congestion control response to ECN congestion\
    \ indications\n      be the same as to drops.  IETF approval, e.g., via an Experimental\n\
    \      RFC in the IETF document stream, is required for any sender\n      congestion\
    \ response used in this area of experimentation.  See\n      Section 4.1 for further\
    \ discussion.\n   Congestion Marking Differences:  Congestion marking at network\
    \ nodes\n      can be configured to maintain very shallow queues in conjunction\n\
    \      with a different sender response to congestion indications (CE\n      marks),\
    \ e.g., as proposed in [ECN-L4S].  The traffic involved\n      needs to be identified\
    \ by the senders to the network nodes in\n      order to avoid damage to other\
    \ network traffic whose senders do\n      not expect the more frequent congestion\
    \ marking used to maintain\n      very shallow queues.  Use of different ECN codepoints,\n\
    \      specifically ECT(0) and ECT(1), is a promising means of traffic\n     \
    \ identification for this purpose, but that technique is at variance\n      with\
    \ the requirement in RFC 3168 that traffic marked as ECT(0) not\n      receive\
    \ different treatment in the network by comparison to\n      traffic marked as\
    \ ECT(1).  IETF approval, e.g., via an\n      Experimental RFC in the IETF document\
    \ stream, is required for any\n      differences in congestion marking or sender\
    \ congestion response\n      used in this area of experimentation.  See Section\
    \ 4.2 for further\n      discussion.\n   TCP Control Packets and Retransmissions:\
    \  RFC 3168 limits the use of\n      ECN with TCP to data packets, excluding retransmissions.\
    \  With the\n      successful deployment of ECN in large portions of the Internet,\n\
    \      there is interest in extending the benefits of ECN to TCP control\n   \
    \   packets (e.g., SYNs) and retransmitted packets, e.g., as proposed\n      in\
    \ [ECN-TCP].  This is at variance with RFC 3168's prohibition of\n      ECN for\
    \ TCP control packets and retransmitted packets.  See\n      Section 4.3 for further\
    \ discussion.\n   The scope of this memo is limited to these three areas of\n\
    \   experimentation.  This memo expresses no view on the likely outcomes\n   of\
    \ the proposed experiments and does not specify the experiments in\n   detail.\
    \  Additional experiments in these areas are possible, e.g., on\n   use of ECN\
    \ to support deployment of a protocol similar to Data Center\n   TCP (DCTCP) [RFC8257]\
    \ beyond DCTCP's current applicability that is\n   limited to data center environments.\
    \  The purpose of this memo is to\n   remove constraints in Standards Track RFCs\
    \ that stand in the way of\n   these areas of experimentation.\n"

  contents:
  - "2.1.  Effective Congestion Control is Required\n   Congestion control remains\
    \ an important aspect of the Internet\n   architecture [RFC2914].  Any Experimental\
    \ RFC in the IETF document\n   stream that takes advantage of this memo's updates\
    \ to any RFC is\n   required to discuss the congestion control implications of\
    \ the\n   experiment(s) in order to provide assurance that deployment of the\n\
    \   experiment(s) does not pose a congestion-based threat to the\n   operation\
    \ of the Internet.\n"
- title: 2.2.  Network Considerations for ECN Experimentation
  contents:
  - "2.2.  Network Considerations for ECN Experimentation\n   ECN functionality [RFC3168]\
    \ is becoming widely deployed in the\n   Internet and is being designed into additional\
    \ protocols such as\n   Transparent Interconnection of Lots of Links (TRILL) [ECN-TRILL].\n\
    \   ECN experiments are expected to coexist with deployed ECN\n   functionality,\
    \ with the responsibility for that coexistence falling\n   primarily upon designers\
    \ of experimental changes to ECN.  In\n   addition, protocol designers and implementers,\
    \ as well as network\n   operators, may desire to anticipate and/or support ECN\
    \ experiments.\n   The following guidelines will help avoid conflicts with the\
    \ areas of\n   ECN experimentation enabled by this memo:\n   1.  Forwarding behavior\
    \ as described in RFC 3168 remains the\n       preferred approach for routers\
    \ that are not involved in ECN\n       experiments, in particular continuing to\
    \ treat the ECT(0) and\n       ECT(1) codepoints as equivalent, as specified in\
    \ Section 4.2\n       below.\n   2.  Network nodes that forward packets SHOULD\
    \ NOT assume that the ECN\n       CE codepoint indicates that the packet would\
    \ have been dropped if\n       ECN were not in use.  This is because Congestion\
    \ Response\n       Differences experiments employ different congestion responses\
    \ to\n       dropped packets by comparison to receipt of CE-marked packets\n \
    \      (see Section 4.1 below), so CE-marked packets SHOULD NOT be\n       arbitrarily\
    \ dropped.  A corresponding difference in congestion\n       responses already\
    \ occurs when the ECN field is used for\n       Pre-Congestion Notification (PCN)\
    \ [RFC6660].\n   3.  A network node MUST NOT originate traffic marked with ECT(1)\n\
    \       unless the network node is participating in a Congestion Marking\n   \
    \    Differences experiment that uses ECT(1), as specified in\n       Section\
    \ 4.2 below.\n   Some ECN experiments use ECN with packets where ECN has not been\
    \ used\n   previously, specifically TCP control packets and retransmissions; see\n\
    \   Section 4.3 below.  The new middlebox behavior requirements in that\n   section\
    \ are of particular importance.  In general, any system or\n   protocol that inspects\
    \ or monitors network traffic SHOULD be prepared\n   to encounter ECN usage on\
    \ packets and traffic that currently do not\n   use ECN.\n   ECN field handling\
    \ requirements for tunnel encapsulation and\n   decapsulation are specified in\
    \ [RFC6040], which is in the process of\n   being updated by [ECN-SHIM].  Related\
    \ guidance for encapsulations\n   whose outer headers are not IP headers can be\
    \ found in [ECN-ENCAP].\n   These requirements and guidance apply to all traffic,\
    \ including\n   traffic that is part of any ECN experiment.\n"

  - "2.3.  Operational and Management Considerations\n   Changes in network traffic\
    \ behavior that result from ECN\n   experimentation are likely to impact network\
    \ operations and\n   management.  Designers of ECN experiments are expected to\
    \ anticipate\n   possible impacts and consider how they may be dealt with.  Specific\n\
    \   topics to consider include possible network management changes or\n   extensions,\
    \ monitoring of the experimental deployment, collection of\n   data for evaluation\
    \ of the experiment, and possible interactions with\n   other protocols, particularly\
    \ protocols that encapsulate network\n   traffic.\n   For further discussion,\
    \ see [RFC5706]; the questions in Appendix A of\n   RFC 5706 provide a concise\
    \ survey of some important aspects to\n   consider.\n"
- title: 3.  ECN Nonce and RFC 3540
  contents:
  - "3.  ECN Nonce and RFC 3540\n   As specified in RFC 3168, ECN uses two ECN-Capable\
    \ Transport (ECT)\n   codepoints, ECT(0) and ECT(1), to indicate that a packet\
    \ supports\n   ECN.  RFC 3168 assigned the second codepoint, ECT(1), to support\
    \ ECN\n   nonce functionality that discourages receivers from exploiting ECN to\n\
    \   improve their throughput at the expense of other network users.  That\n  \
    \ ECN nonce functionality is fully specified in RFC 3540 [RFC3540].\n   This section\
    \ explains why RFC 3540 has been reclassified from\n   Experimental to Historic\
    \ and makes associated updates to RFC 3168.\n   While the ECN nonce works as specified,\
    \ and has been deployed in\n   limited environments, widespread usage in the Internet\
    \ has not\n   materialized.  A study of the ECN behavior of the top one million\
    \ web\n   servers using 2014 data [Trammell15] found that after ECN was\n   negotiated,\
    \ none of the 581,711 IPv4 servers tested were using both\n   ECT codepoints,\
    \ which would have been a possible sign of ECN nonce\n   usage.  Of the 17,028\
    \ IPv6 servers tested, four set both ECT(0) and\n   ECT(1) on data packets.  This\
    \ might have been evidence of use of the\n   ECN nonce by these four servers,\
    \ but it might equally have been due\n   to erroneous re-marking of the ECN field\
    \ by a middlebox or router.\n   With the emergence of new experimental functionality\
    \ that depends on\n   use of the ECT(1) codepoint for other purposes, continuing\
    \ to reserve\n   that codepoint for the ECN nonce experiment is no longer justified.\n\
    \   In addition, other approaches to discouraging receivers from\n   exploiting\
    \ ECN have emerged; see Appendix B.1 of [ECN-L4S].\n   Therefore, in support of\
    \ ECN experimentation with the ECT(1)\n   codepoint, this memo:\n   o  Declares\
    \ that the ECN nonce experiment [RFC3540] has concluded and\n      notes the absence\
    \ of widespread deployment.\n   o  Updates RFC 3168 [RFC3168] to remove discussion\
    \ of the ECN nonce\n      and use of ECT(1) for that nonce.\n   The four primary\
    \ updates to RFC 3168 that remove discussion of the\n   ECN nonce and use of ECT(1)\
    \ for that nonce are as follows:\n   1.  The removal of the paragraph in Section\
    \ 5 that immediately\n       follows Figure 1; this paragraph discusses the ECN\
    \ nonce as the\n       motivation for two ECT codepoints.\n   2.  The removal\
    \ of Section 11.2, \"A Discussion of the ECN nonce\", in\n       its entirety.\n\
    \   3.  The removal of the last paragraph of Section 12, which states\n      \
    \ that ECT(1) may be used as part of the implementation of the ECN\n       nonce.\n\
    \   4.  The removal of the first two paragraphs of Section 20.2, which\n     \
    \  discuss the ECN nonce and alternatives.  No changes are made to\n       the\
    \ rest of Section 20.2, which discusses alternative uses for\n       the fourth\
    \ ECN codepoint.\n   In addition, other less-substantive changes to RFC 3168 are\
    \ required\n   to remove all other mentions of the ECN nonce and to remove\n \
    \  implications that ECT(1) is intended for use by the ECN nonce; these\n   specific\
    \ text updates are omitted for brevity.\n"

  - "4.  Updates to RFC 3168\n   The following subsections specify updates to RFC\
    \ 3168 to enable the\n   three areas of experimentation summarized in Section\
    \ 2.\n"
- title: 4.1.  Congestion Response Differences
  contents:
  - "4.1.  Congestion Response Differences\n   RFC 3168 specifies that senders respond\
    \ identically to packet drops\n   and ECN congestion indications.  ECN congestion\
    \ indications are\n   predominately originated by Active Queue Management (AQM)\
    \ mechanisms\n   in intermediate buffers.  AQM mechanisms are usually configured\
    \ to\n   maintain shorter queue lengths than non-AQM-based mechanisms,\n   particularly\
    \ non-AQM drop-based mechanisms such as tail-drop, as AQM\n   mechanisms indicate\
    \ congestion before the queue overflows.  While the\n   occurrence of loss does\
    \ not easily enable the receiver to determine\n   if AQM is used, the receipt\
    \ of an ECN CE mark conveys a strong\n   likelihood that AQM was used to manage\
    \ the bottleneck queue.  Hence,\n   an ECN congestion indication communicates\
    \ a higher likelihood than a\n   dropped packet that a short queue exists at the\
    \ network bottleneck\n   node [TCP-ABE].  This difference suggests that for congestion\n\
    \   indicated by ECN, a different sender congestion response (e.g.,\n   sender\
    \ backs off by a smaller amount) may be appropriate by\n   comparison to the sender\
    \ response to congestion indicated by loss.\n   However, Section 5 of RFC 3168\
    \ specifies that:\n      Upon the receipt by an ECN-Capable transport of a single\
    \ CE\n      packet, the congestion control algorithms followed at the end-\n \
    \     systems MUST be essentially the same as the congestion control\n      response\
    \ to a *single* dropped packet.\n   This memo updates this text from RFC 3168\
    \ to allow the congestion\n   control response (including the TCP Sender's congestion\
    \ control\n   response) to a CE-marked packet to differ from the response to a\n\
    \   dropped packet, provided that the changes from RFC 3168 are\n   documented\
    \ in an Experimental RFC in the IETF document stream.  The\n   specific change\
    \ to RFC 3168 is to insert the words \"unless otherwise\n   specified by an Experimental\
    \ RFC in the IETF document stream\" at the\n   end of the sentence quoted above.\n\
    \   RFC 4774 [RFC4774] quotes the above text from RFC 3168 as background,\n  \

  contents:
  - "4.2.  Congestion Marking Differences\n   Taken to its limit, an AQM algorithm\
    \ that uses ECN congestion\n   indications can be configured to maintain very\
    \ shallow queues,\n   thereby reducing network latency by comparison to maintaining\
    \ a\n   larger queue.  Significantly more aggressive sender responses to ECN\n\
    \   are needed to make effective use of such very shallow queues;\n   \"Datacenter\
    \ TCP (DCTCP)\" [RFC8257] provides an example.  In this\n   case, separate network\
    \ node treatments are essential, both to prevent\n   the aggressive low-latency\
    \ traffic from starving conventional traffic\n   (if present) and to prevent any\
    \ conventional traffic disruption to\n   any lower-latency service that uses the\
    \ very shallow queues.  Use of\n   different ECN codepoints is a promising means\
    \ of identifying these\n   two classes of traffic to network nodes; hence, this\
    \ area of\n   experimentation is based on the use of the ECT(1) codepoint to\n\
    \   request ECN congestion marking behavior in the network that differs\n   from\
    \ ECT(0).  It is essential that any such change in ECN congestion\n   marking\
    \ behavior be counterbalanced by use of a different IETF-\n   approved congestion\
    \ response to CE marks at the sender, e.g., as\n   proposed in [ECN-L4S].\n  \
    \ Section 5 of RFC 3168 specifies that \"Routers treat the ECT(0) and\n   ECT(1)\
    \ codepoints as equivalent.\"\n   This memo updates RFC 3168 to allow routers\
    \ to treat the ECT(0) and\n   ECT(1) codepoints differently, provided that the\
    \ changes from RFC\n   3168 are documented in an Experimental RFC in the IETF\
    \ document\n   stream.  The specific change to RFC 3168 is to insert the words\n\
    \   \"unless otherwise specified by an Experimental RFC in the IETF\n   document\
    \ stream\" at the end of the above sentence.\n   When an AQM is configured to\
    \ use ECN congestion indications to\n   maintain a very shallow queue, congestion\
    \ indications are marked on\n   packets that would not have been dropped if ECN\
    \ was not in use.\n   Section 5 of RFC 3168 specifies that:\n      For a router,\
    \ the CE codepoint of an ECN-Capable packet SHOULD\n      only be set if the router\
    \ would otherwise have dropped the packet\n      as an indication of congestion\
    \ to the end nodes.  When the\n      router's buffer is not yet full and the router\
    \ is prepared to drop\n      a packet to inform end nodes of incipient congestion,\
    \ the router\n      should first check to see if the ECT codepoint is set in that\n\
    \      packet's IP header.  If so, then instead of dropping the packet,\n    \
    \  the router MAY instead set the CE codepoint in the IP header.\n   This memo\
    \ updates RFC 3168 to allow congestion indications that are\n   not equivalent\
    \ to drops, provided that the changes from RFC 3168 are\n   documented in an Experimental\
    \ RFC in the IETF document stream.  The\n   specific change is to change \"For\
    \ a router\" to \"Unless otherwise\n   specified by an Experimental RFC in the\
    \ IETF document stream\" at the\n   beginning of the first sentence of the above\
    \ paragraph.\n   A larger update to RFC 3168 is necessary to enable sender usage\
    \ of\n   ECT(1) to request network congestion marking behavior that maintains\n\
    \   very shallow queues at network nodes.  When using loss as a\n   congestion\
    \ signal, the number of signals provided should be reduced\n   to a minimum; hence,\
    \ only the presence or absence of congestion is\n   communicated.  In contrast,\
    \ ECN can provide a richer signal, e.g., to\n   indicate the current level of\
    \ congestion, without the disadvantage of\n   a larger number of packet losses.\
    \  A proposed experiment in this\n   area, Low Latency Low Loss Scalable throughput\
    \ (L4S) [ECN-L4S],\n   significantly increases the CE marking probability for\
    \ traffic marked\n   as ECT(1) in a fashion that would interact badly with existing\
    \ sender\n   congestion response functionality because that functionality assumes\n\
    \   that the network marks ECT packets as frequently as it would drop\n   Not-ECT\
    \ packets.  If network traffic that uses such a conventional\n   sender congestion\
    \ response were to encounter L4S's increased marking\n   probability (and hence\
    \ rate) at a network bottleneck queue, the\n   resulting traffic throughput is\
    \ likely to be much less than intended\n   for the level of congestion at the\
    \ bottleneck queue.\n   This memo updates RFC 3168 to remove that interaction\
    \ for ECT(1).\n   The specific update to Section 5 of RFC 3168 is to replace the\n\
    \   following two paragraphs:\n      Senders are free to use either the ECT(0)\
    \ or the ECT(1) codepoint\n      to indicate ECT, on a packet-by-packet basis.\n\
    \      The use of both the two codepoints for ECT, ECT(0) and ECT(1), is\n   \
    \   motivated primarily by the desire to allow mechanisms for the data\n     \
    \ sender to verify that network elements are not erasing the CE\n      codepoint,\
    \ and that data receivers are properly reporting to the\n      sender the receipt\
    \ of packets with the CE codepoint set, as\n      required by the transport protocol.\
    \  Guidelines for the senders\n      and receivers to differentiate between the\
    \ ECT(0) and ECT(1)\n      codepoints will be addressed in separate documents,\
    \ for each\n      transport protocol.  In particular, this document does not address\n\
    \      mechanisms for TCP end-nodes to differentiate between the ECT(0)\n    \
    \  and ECT(1) codepoints.  Protocols and senders that only require a\n      single\
    \ ECT codepoint SHOULD use ECT(0).\n   with this paragraph:\n      Protocols and\
    \ senders MUST use the ECT(0) codepoint to indicate\n      ECT unless otherwise\
    \ specified by an Experimental RFC in the IETF\n      document stream.  Protocols\
    \ and senders MUST NOT use the ECT(1)\n      codepoint to indicate ECT unless\
    \ otherwise specified by an\n      Experimental RFC in the IETF document stream.\
    \  Guidelines for\n      senders and receivers to differentiate between the ECT(0)\
    \ and\n      ECT(1) codepoints will be addressed in separate documents, for\n\

    \ address mechanisms for TCP end-nodes to differentiate between the\n      ECT(0)\
    \ and ECT(1) codepoints.\n   Congestion Marking Differences experiments SHOULD\
    \ modify the network\n   behavior for traffic marked as ECT(1) rather than ECT(0)\
    \ if network\n   behavior for only one ECT codepoint is modified.  Congestion\
    \ Marking\n   Differences experiments MUST NOT modify the network behavior for\n\
    \   traffic marked as ECT(0) in a fashion that requires changes to the\n   sender\
    \ congestion response to obtain desired network behavior.  If a\n   Congestion\
    \ Marking Differences experiment modifies the network\n   behavior for traffic\
    \ marked as ECT(1), e.g., CE-marking behavior, in\n   a fashion that requires\

    \ packets, e.g., as\n   proposed by ECN++ [ECN-TCP].\n   RFC 3168 prohibits use\
    \ of ECN for TCP control packets and\n   retransmitted packets in a number of\
    \ places:\n   o  Section 5.2: \"To ensure the reliable delivery of the congestion\n\
    \      indication of the CE codepoint, an ECT codepoint MUST NOT be set\n    \
    \  in a packet unless the loss of that packet in the network would be\n      detected\

    \   o  Section 6.1.1: \"A host MUST NOT set ECT on SYN or SYN-ACK packets\"\n\

    \ receiver SHOULD ignore the ECN field on arriving data\n      packets that are\
    \ outside of the receiver's current window.\"\n   o  Section 6.1.6: \"...the TCP\
    \ data sender MUST NOT set either an ECT\n      codepoint or the CWR bit on window\

    \ for a network element, e.g., a firewall, to\n   discard such a packet as invalid.\
    \  For this area of ECN\n   experimentation to be useful, middleboxes ought not\
    \ to do that;\n   therefore, RFC 3168 is updated by adding the following text\

    \ specified by an Experimental RFC in the IETF\n      document stream, middleboxes\
    \ SHOULD NOT discard TCP control\n      packets and retransmitted TCP packets\
    \ solely because the ECN field\n      in the IP header does not contain Not-ECT.\
    \  An exception to this\n      requirement occurs in responding to an attack that\
    \ uses ECN\n      codepoints other than Not-ECT.  For example, as part of the\n\
    \      response, it may be appropriate to drop ECT-marked TCP SYN packets\n  \
    \    with higher probability than TCP SYN packets marked with Not-ECT.\n     \
    \ Any such exceptional discarding of TCP control packets and\n      retransmitted\
    \ TCP packets in response to an attack MUST NOT be\n      done routinely in the\
    \ absence of an attack and SHOULD only be done\n      if it is determined that\
    \ the use of ECN is contributing to the\n      attack.\n"
