- title: 1.  The SNMP Management Framework
  contents:
  - "1.  The SNMP Management Framework\n   The SNMP Management Framework presently\
    \ consists of five major\n   components:\n   o   An overall architecture, described\
    \ in RFC 2571 [RFC2571].\n   o   Mechanisms for describing and naming objects\
    \ and events for the\n       purpose of management. The first version of this\
    \ Structure of\n       Management Information (SMI) is called SMIv1 and described\
    \ in STD\n       16, RFC 1155 [RFC1155], STD 16, RFC 1212 [RFC1212] and RFC 1215\n\
    \       [RFC1215].  The second version, called SMIv2, is described in STD\n  \
    \     58, RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58,\n       RFC\
    \ 2580 [RFC2580].\n   o   Message protocols for transferring management information.\
    \ The\n       first version of the SNMP message protocol is called SNMPv1 and\n\
    \       described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [RFC1157].  A second version of the\n  \
    \     SNMP message protocol, which is not an Internet standards track\n      \
    \ protocol, is called SNMPv2c and described in RFC 1901 [RFC1901]\n       and\
    \ RFC 1906 [RFC1906].  The third version of the message\n       protocol is called\
    \ SNMPv3 and described in RFC 1906 [RFC1906],\n       RFC 2572 [RFC2572] and RFC\
    \ 2574 [RFC2574].\n   o   Protocol operations for accessing management information.\
    \ The\n       first set of protocol operations and associated PDU formats is\n\
    \       described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [RFC1157].  A second set of\n       protocol\
    \ operations and associated PDU formats is described in\n       RFC 1905 [RFC1905].\n\
    \   o   A set of fundamental applications described in RFC 2573 [RFC2573]\n  \
    \     and the view-based access control mechanism described in RFC 2575\n    \
    \   [RFC2575].\n   A more detailed introduction to the current SNMP Management\
    \ Framework\n   can be found in RFC 2570 [RFC2570].\n   Managed objects are accessed\
    \ via a virtual information store, termed\n   the Management Information Base\
    \ or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are\n   defined using the mechanisms defined in\
    \ the SMI.\n   This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2.\
    \  The\n   textual conventions defined in this MIB module cannot be translated\n\
    \   to SMIv1 since the Counter64 type does not exist in SMIv1.\n"
- title: 2.  Overview
  contents:
  - "2.  Overview\n   The Structure of Management Information [RFC2578] does not explicitly\n\
    \   address the question of how to represent integer objects other than\n   counters\
    \ that would require up to 64 bits to provide the necessary\n   range and precision.\
    \  There are MIBs in progress targeted for the\n   standards track, which need\
    \ such data types. This memo specifies a\n   short term solution, using textual\
    \ conventions, to meet these needs.\n"
- title: 2.1.  Short Term and Long Term Objectives
  contents:
  - "2.1.  Short Term and Long Term Objectives\n   There is an immediate need to provide\
    \ a Gauge64 data type, similar in\n   semantics to the Gauge32 data type, in order\
    \ to support common data\n   representations such as:\n   -  a snapshot of a Counter64\
    \ at a given moment, e.g., history ring\n      buffer\n   -  the difference between\
    \ two Counter64 values\n   There is also an immediate need for a 64-bit zero-based\
    \ counter type,\n   similar in semantics to the ZeroBasedCounter32 TC defined\
    \ in the\n   RMON-2 MIB [RFC2021].\n   Both of these textual conventions should\
    \ use a base type of Gauge64\n   or Unsigned64, but such a base type is not available.\
    \  Until such a\n   base type is defined and deployed, these temporary textual\n\
    \   conventions (which use a base type of Counter64) will be used in MIBs\n  \
    \ which require unsigned 64-bit data types.\n   In order to be backward compatible\
    \ with existing implementations of\n   Counter64, the ASN.1 encoding of unsigned\
    \ 64-bit data types must be\n   identical to the encoding of Counter64 objects,\
    \ i.e., identified by\n   the [APPLICATION 6] ASN.1 tag.\n   Note that the textual\
    \ conventions defined in this document represent\n   a limited and short-term\
    \ solution to the problem.  These textual\n   conventions may be deprecated as\
    \ a long term solution is defined and\n   deployed to replace them.  A MIB object\
    \ which uses either of these\n   textual conventions may also eventually have\
    \ to be deprecated.\n"
- title: 2.2.  Limitations of the Textual Convention Approach
  contents:
  - "2.2.  Limitations of the Textual Convention Approach\n   New unsigned data types\
    \ with textual conventions based on the\n   Counter64 tag, instead of a new (or\
    \ other existing) ASN.1 tag have\n   some limitations:\n   -  The MAX-ACCESS of\
    \ the TC must be read-only, because the MAX-ACCESS\n      of the underlying Counter64\
    \ type is read-only.\n   -  No sub-range can be specified on the TC-derived types,\
    \ because\n      sub-ranges are not allowed on Counter64 objects.\n   -  No DEFVAL\
    \ clause can be specified for the TC-derived types,\n      because DEFVALs are\
    \ not allowed on Counter64 objects.\n   -  The TC-derived types cannot be used\
    \ in an INDEX clause, because\n      there is no INDEX clause mapping defined\
    \ for objects of type\n      Counter64.\n"
- title: 3.  New Textual Conventions
  contents:
  - "3.  New Textual Conventions\n   The following textual conventions are defined\
    \ to support unsigned\n   64-bit data types.\n"
- title: 3.1.  CounterBasedGauge64
  contents:
  - "3.1.  CounterBasedGauge64\n   This textual convention defines a 64-bit gauge,\
    \ but defined with\n   Counter64 syntax, since no Gauge64 or Unsigned64 base type\
    \ is\n   available in SMIv2.\n   This TC is used for storing the difference between\
    \ two Counter64\n   values, or simply storing a snapshot of a Counter64 value\
    \ at a given\n   moment in time.\n"
- title: 3.2.  ZeroBasedCounter64
  contents:
  - "3.2.  ZeroBasedCounter64\n   This textual convention defines a 64-bit counter\
    \ with an initial\n   value of zero, instead of an arbitrary initial value.\n\

    \     STATUS       current\n     DESCRIPTION\n           \"The CounterBasedGauge64\
    \ type represents a non-negative\n           integer, which may increase or decrease,\
    \ but shall never\n           exceed a maximum value, nor fall below a minimum\
    \ value. The\n           maximum value can not be greater than 2^64-1\n      \
    \     (18446744073709551615 decimal), and the minimum value can\n           not\
    \ be smaller than 0.  The value of a CounterBasedGauge64\n           has its maximum\
    \ value whenever the information being modeled\n           is greater than or\
    \ equal to its maximum value, and has its\n           minimum value whenever the\
    \ information being modeled is\n           smaller than or equal to its minimum\
    \ value.  If the\n           information being modeled subsequently decreases\
    \ below\n           (increases above) the maximum (minimum) value, the\n     \
    \      CounterBasedGauge64 also decreases (increases).\n           Note that this\
    \ TC is not strictly supported in SMIv2,\n           because the 'always increasing'\
    \ and 'counter wrap' semantics\n           associated with the Counter64 base\
    \ type are not preserved.\n           It is possible that management applications\
    \ which rely\n           solely upon the (Counter64) ASN.1 tag to determine object\n\
    \           semantics will mistakenly operate upon objects of this type\n    \
    \       as they would for Counter64 objects.\n           This textual convention\
    \ represents a limited and short-term\n           solution, and may be deprecated\
    \ as a long term solution is\n           defined and deployed to replace it.\"\

    \ current\n     DESCRIPTION\n           \"This TC describes an object which counts\
    \ events with the\n           following semantics: objects of this type will be\
    \ set to\n           zero(0) on creation and will thereafter count appropriate\n\
    \           events, wrapping back to zero(0) when the value 2^64 is\n        \
    \   reached.\n           Provided that an application discovers the new object\
    \ within\n           the minimum time to wrap it can use the initial value as\
    \ a\n           delta since it last polled the table of which this object is\n\
    \           part.  It is important for a management station to be aware\n    \
    \       of this minimum time and the actual time between polls, and\n        \
    \   to discard data if the actual time is too long or there is\n           no\
    \ defined minimum time.\n           Typically this TC is used in tables where\
    \ the INDEX space is\n           constantly changing and/or the TimeFilter mechanism\

    \ retain all the\n           semantics of the Counter64 base type. Specifically,\
    \ a\n           Counter64 has an arbitrary initial value, but objects\n      \
    \     defined with this TC are required to start at the value\n           zero.\
    \  This behavior is not likely to have any adverse\n           effects on management\
    \ applications which are expecting\n           Counter64 semantics.\n        \
    \   This textual convention represents a limited and short-term\n           solution,\
