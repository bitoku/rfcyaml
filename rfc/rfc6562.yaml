- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   The Secure RTP (SRTP) framework [RFC3711] is a widely used\
    \ framework\n   for securing RTP sessions [RFC3550].  SRTP provides the ability\
    \ to\n   encrypt the payload of an RTP packet, and optionally add an\n   authentication\
    \ tag, while leaving the RTP header and any header\n   extension in the clear.\
    \  A range of encryption transforms can be used\n   with SRTP, but none of the\
    \ predefined encryption transforms use any\n   padding; the RTP and SRTP payload\
    \ sizes match exactly.\n   When using SRTP with voice streams compressed using\
    \ variable bit rate\n   (VBR) codecs, the length of the compressed packets will\
    \ depend on the\n   characteristics of the speech signal.  This variation in packet\
    \ size\n   will leak a small amount of information about the contents of the\n\
    \   speech signal.  This is potentially a security risk for some\n   applications.\
    \  For example, [spot-me] shows that known phrases in an\n   encrypted call using\
    \ the Speex codec in VBR mode can be recognized\n   with high accuracy in certain\
    \ circumstances, and [fon-iks] shows that\n   approximate transcripts of encrypted\
    \ VBR calls can be derived for\n   some codecs without breaking the encryption.\
    \  How significant these\n   results are, and how they generalize to other codecs,\
    \ is still an\n   open question.  This memo discusses ways in which such traffic\n\
    \   analysis risks may be mitigated.\n   The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\"\
    , \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\"\
    , \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n   document are to be interpreted as described\
    \ in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].\n"
- title: 2.  Scenario-Dependent Risk
  contents:
  - "2.  Scenario-Dependent Risk\n   Whether the information leaks and attacks discussed\
    \ in [spot-me],\n   [fon-iks], and similar works are significant is highly dependent\
    \ on\n   the application and use scenario.  In the worst case, using the rate\n\
    \   information to recognize a prerecorded message knowing the set of all\n  \
    \ possible messages would lead to near-perfect accuracy.  Even when the\n   audio\
    \ is not prerecorded, there is a real possibility of being able\n   to recognize\
    \ contents from encrypted audio when the dialog is highly\n   structured (e.g.,\
    \ when the eavesdropper knows that only a handful of\n   possible sentences are\
    \ possible), and thus contain only little\n   information.  Recognizing unconstrained\
    \ conversational speech from\n   the rate information alone is unreliable and\
    \ computationally\n   expensive at present, but does appear possible in some circumstances.\n\
    \   These attacks are only likely to improve over time.\n   In practical SRTP\
    \ scenarios, how significant the information leak is\n   when compared to other\
    \ SRTP-related information must be considered,\n   such as the fact that the source\
    \ and destination IP addresses are\n   available.\n"
- title: 3.  Guidelines for Use of VBR Audio with SRTP
  contents:
  - "3.  Guidelines for Use of VBR Audio with SRTP\n   It is the responsibility of\
    \ the application designer to determine the\n   appropriate trade-off between\
    \ security and bandwidth overhead.  As a\n   general rule, VBR codecs should be\
    \ considered safe in the context of\n   low-value encrypted unstructured calls.\
    \  However, applications that\n   make use of prerecorded messages where the contents\
    \ of such\n   prerecorded messages may be of any value to an eavesdropper (i.e.,\n\
    \   messages beyond standard greeting messages) SHOULD NOT use codecs in\n   VBR\
    \ mode.  Interactive voice response (IVR) applications would be\n   particularly\
    \ vulnerable since an eavesdropper could easily use the\n   rate information to\
    \ recognize the prompts being played out.\n   Applications conveying highly sensitive\
    \ unstructured information\n   SHOULD NOT use codecs in VBR mode.\n   It is safe\
    \ to use variable rate coding to adapt the output of a voice\n   codec to match\
    \ characteristics of a network channel, provided this\n   adaptation is done in\
    \ a way that does not expose any information on\n   the speech signal.  For example,\
    \ VBR audio can be used for congestion\n   control purposes, where the variation\
    \ is driven by the available\n   network bandwidth, not by the input speech (i.e.,\
    \ the packet sizes\n   and spacing are constant unless the network conditions\
    \ change).  VBR\n   speech codecs can safely be used in this fashion with SRTP\
    \ while\n   avoiding leaking information on the contents of the speech signal\n\
    \   that might be useful for traffic analysis.\n"
- title: 4.  Guidelines for Use of Voice Activity Detection with SRTP
  contents:
  - "4.  Guidelines for Use of Voice Activity Detection with SRTP\n   Many speech\
    \ codecs employ some form of voice activity detection (VAD)\n   to either suppress\
    \ output frames, or generate some form of lower-rate\n   comfort noise frames,\
    \ during periods when the speaker is not active.\n   If VAD is used on an encrypted\
    \ speech signal, then some information\n   about the characteristics of that speech\
    \ signal can be determined by\n   watching the patterns of voice activity.  This\
    \ information leakage is\n   less than with VBR coding since there are only two\
    \ rates possible.\n   The information leakage due to VAD in SRTP audio sessions\
    \ can be much\n   reduced if the sender adds an unpredictable \"overhang\" period\
    \ to the\n   end of active speech intervals, obscuring their actual length.  An\n\
    \   RTP sender using VAD with encrypted SRTP audio SHOULD insert such an\n   overhang\
    \ period at the end of each talkspurt, delaying the start of\n   the silence/comfort\
    \ noise by a random interval.  The length of the\n   overhang applied to each\
    \ talkspurt must be randomly chosen in such a\n   way that it is computationally\
    \ infeasible for an attacker to reliably\n   estimate the length of that talkspurt.\
    \  This may be more important\n   for short talkspurts, since it seems easier\
    \ to distinguish between\n   different single word responses based on the exact\
    \ word length, than\n   to glean meaning from the duration of a longer phrase.\
    \  The audio\n   data comprising the overhang period must be packetized and\n\
    \   transmitted in RTP packets in a manner that is indistinguishable from\n  \
    \ the other data in the talkspurt.\n   The overhang period SHOULD have an exponentially\
    \ decreasing\n   probability distribution function.  This ensures a long tail,\
    \ while\n   being easy to compute.  It is RECOMMENDED to use an overhang with\
    \ a\n   \"half life\" of a few hundred milliseconds (this should be sufficient\n\
    \   to obscure the presence of interword pauses and the lengths of single\n  \
    \ words spoken in isolation, for example, the digits of a credit card\n   number\
    \ clearly enunciated for an automated system, but not so long as\n   to significantly\
    \ reduce the effectiveness of VAD for detecting\n   listening pauses).  Despite\
    \ the overhang (and no matter what the\n   duration is), there is still a small\
    \ amount of information leaked\n   about the start time of the talkspurt due to\
    \ the fact that we cannot\n   apply an overhang to the start of a talkspurt without\
    \ unacceptably\n   affecting intelligibility.  For that reason, VAD SHOULD NOT\
    \ be used\n   in encrypted IVR applications where the content of prerecorded\n\
    \   messages may be of any value to an eavesdropper.\n   The application of a\
    \ random overhang period to each talkspurt will\n   reduce the effectiveness of\
    \ VAD in SRTP sessions when compared to\n   non-SRTP sessions.  However, it is\
    \ still expected that the use of VAD\n   will provide significant bandwidth savings\
    \ for many encrypted\n   sessions.\n"
- title: 5.  Padding the Output of VBR Codecs
  contents:
  - "5.  Padding the Output of VBR Codecs\n   For scenarios where VBR is considered\
    \ unsafe, a constant bit rate\n   (CBR) codec SHOULD be negotiated and used instead,\
    \ or the VBR codec\n   SHOULD be operated in a CBR mode.  However, if the codec\
    \ does not\n   support CBR, RTP padding SHOULD be used to reduce the information\n\
    \   leak to an insignificant level.  Packets may be padded to a constant\n   size\
    \ or to a small range of sizes ([spot-me] achieves good results by\n   padding\
    \ to the next multiple of 16 octets, but the amount of padding\n   needed to hide\
    \ the variation in packet size will depend on the codec\n   and the sophistication\
    \ of the attacker) or may be padded to a size\n   that varies with time.  The\
    \ most secure and RECOMMENDED option is to\n   pad all packets throughout the\
    \ call to the same size.\n   In the case where the size of the padded packets\
    \ varies in time, the\n   same concerns as for VAD apply.  That is, the padding\
    \ SHOULD NOT be\n   reduced without waiting for a certain (random) time.  The\
    \ RECOMMENDED\n   \"hold time\" is the same as the one for VAD.\n   Note that\
    \ SRTP encrypts the count of the number of octets of padding\n   added to a packet,\
    \ but not the bit in the RTP header that indicates\n   that the packet has been\
    \ padded.  For this reason, it is RECOMMENDED\n   to add at least one octet of\
    \ padding to all packets in a media\n   stream, so an attacker cannot tell which\
    \ packets needed padding.\n"
