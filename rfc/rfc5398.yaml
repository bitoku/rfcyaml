  - "1.  Introduction\n   To reduce the likelihood of conflict and confusion when\
    \ relating\n   documented examples to deployed systems, two blocks of Autonomous\n\
    \   System numbers (ASNs) are reserved for use in examples in RFCs,\n   books,\
    \ documentation, and the like.  This document describes the\n   reservation of\
    \ two blocks of ASNs as reserved numbers for use in\n   documentation.\n   The\
    \ problems such conflicts may cause have already been encountered\n   with IPv4\
    \ addresses where literal use of documented examples in a\n   production environment\
    \ causes address and routing conflicts with\n   existing services.  Since private-use\
    \ ASNs already have a context of\n   use in deployed networks, these ASNs cannot\
    \ be used in many example\n   situations.  In making an explicit allocation of\
    \ a set of AS numbers\n   reserved for documentation use, it is intended that\
    \ any such\n   operational problems may be avoided in the future.\n   Similar\
    \ considerations have been applied to IPv4 addresses\n   [IANA.IPv4], IPv6 addresses\
    \ [RFC3849], and domain names [RFC2606],\n   and reservations have been made for\
    \ similar purposes.\n"
- title: 2.  ASNs for Documentation Use
  contents:
  - "2.  ASNs for Documentation Use\n   To allow documentation to accurately describe\
    \ deployment examples,\n   the use of public or private-use AS numbers is inappropriate,\
    \ and a\n   reserved block of AS numbers is required.  This ensures that\n   documentation\
    \ does not clash with public- or private-use AS numbers\n   in deployed networks,\
    \ and mitigates the risks to operational\n   integrity of the network through\
    \ inappropriate use of documentation\n   to perform literal configuration of routing\
    \ elements on production\n   systems.\n   To allow for examples relating to the\
    \ transition to use of 32-bit AS\n   numbers to be correctly described, a reservation\
    \ of two blocks of AS\n   numbers is proposed in this document.  One reserved\
    \ block of 16\n   contiguous AS numbers is to lie in the range of numbers that\
    \ can be\n   expressed as a 16-bit AS number value (i.e., values less than 65536),\n\
    \   and a second reserved block of 16 contiguous AS numbers is to lie in\n   the\
    \ range of numbers that can only be expressed as 32-bit AS numbers\n   (values\
    \ greater than 65535).\n"

  - "3.  Operational Implications\n   This assignment implies that BGP operational\
    \ configurations should\n   not peer with neighboring ASes that are numbered from\
    \ this reserved\n   AS number set.\n"
- title: 4.  IANA Considerations
  contents:
  - "4.  IANA Considerations\n   IANA has reserved a contiguous block of 16 Autonomous\
    \ System numbers\n   from the unallocated number range within the \"16-bit\" number\
    \ set for\n   documentation purposes, namely 64496 - 64511, and a contiguous block\n\
    \   of 16 Autonomous System numbers from the \"32-bit\" number set for\n   documentation,\
    \ namely 65536 - 65551.  These reservations have been\n   documented in the IANA\
    \ AS Number Registry [IANA.AS].\n"
