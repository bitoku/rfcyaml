  - "Abstract\n   There are numerous applications where there is a need for interaction\n
    \  between the GSTN addressing and Internet addressing.  This memo\n   defines
    a full syntax for one specific case, where there is a need to\n   represent GSTN
    addresses within Internet e-mail addresses. This full\n   syntax is a superset
    of a minimal syntax which has been defined in\n   [1].\n"
  title: Abstract
- contents:
  - "1. Introduction\n   The possible elements composing a \"Global Switched Telephone
    Network\n   (GSTN) address in e-mail\" (also known as the Public Switched\n   Telephone
    Network - PSTN) can vary from a minimum number up to a\n   really large and complex
    collection. As noted the minimal format and\n   general address syntax have been
    defined in [1], along with the\n   mechanism needed to define additional address
    elements. This memo\n   uses this extension mechanism to complete the syntax for
    representing\n   GSTN addresses within e-mail addresses and contains the IANA\n
    \  registrations for all newly defined elements.\n   In particular, the following
    additional address elements shall be\n   defined:\n   -  the detailed definition
    of GSTN number formats, in order to cover\n      various alternative standard
    GSTN numbering schemes, (i.e. gstn-\n      phone, sub-addr-spec and post-dial)\n
    \  -  the message originator and/or recipient specification (pstn-\n      recipient)\n
    \  GSTN addresses in e-mail MAY contain additional elements defined and\n   registered
    in other specifications (see for example \"T33S\" element in\n   [2]), but they
    MUST use definitions contained in this memo for those\n   elements specified here.\n
    \  In particular, \"service-selector\" names and \"qualif-type1\" elements\n   MUST
    be registered with IANA, and published within the \"ASSIGNED\n   NUMBERS\" document.
    This provides a standard mechanism for extending\n   the element sets and should
    avoid unnecessary duplication. IANA\n   Registration form templates for the purpouse
    of registering new\n   elements are provided in Appendix B. In addition the IANA\n
    \  consideration section of this document defines the procedures\n   required
    to proceed with new registrations.\n   A collection of forms for already defined
    \"service-selector\" and\n   \"qualif-type1\" elements is listed in appendix C
    and appendix D\n   respectively.\n   In particular, efforts have been made to
    maintain compatibility with\n   elements defined in existing e-mail gateway services
    and standard\n   specifications. For example, to the extent possible, compatibility\n
    \  has been maintained with the MIXER [3] gateways specifications.\n"

    - "1.1 Relationship with Internet addressing other than e-mail\n   Even if in
      this memo we focus on e-mail addresses, a number of\n   elements defined in
      this specification can also be used for other\n   specifications dealing with
      embedding GSTN addresses into other\n   addresses: for example there is some
      work in progress about URLs\n   specification which adopts similar definitions,
      with slight changes\n   in the global syntax due to specific URL format.\n"

    - "1.2 Terminology and Syntax conventions\n   In this document the formal definitions
      are described using ABNF\n   syntax, as defined into [4]. We will also use some
      of the \"CORE\n   DEFINITIONS\" defined in \"APPENDIX A - CORE\" of that document.

  - "2. GSTN extended number and pstn-mbox extended format\n   In reference [1], section
    2, the minimal definition of pstn-mbox\n   includes the global-phone element,
    and further details are defined in\n   [1] section 2.1.\n   However other non
    global-phone numbering schemes are also possible.\n   Thus, the minimal set syntax
    defined in [1] shall be extended to\n   enable support for local-phone elements.
    Therefore, the gstn-phone\n   format is defined as follows:\n      gstn-phone
    = ( global-phone / local-phone )\n   The complexity of the GSTN system includes
    also the optional use of\n   subaddresses and post dialling sequences. As a consequence,
    there is\n   a need to extend the definition of pstn-mbox per [1] to include\n
    \  support for both the minimal set definition and an extended syntax.\n   The
    expanded definition of pstn-mbox is as follows:\n      pstn-mbox = service-selector
    \"=\" global-phone\n      pstn-mbox =/ service-selector \"=\" gstn-phone\n                   [
    sub-addr-spec ] [post-sep post-dial]\n   NOTE: see section 4 in the event multiple
    \"sub-addr-spec\" elements\n   per pstn-mbox need to be specified.\n"
  - contents:
    - "2.1 The local-phone syntax\n   The local-phone element is intended to represent
      the set of possible\n   cases where the global-phone numbering schema does not
      apply. Given\n   the different and complex conventions currently being used
      in the\n   GSTN system, the local-phone definition supports a large number of\n
      \  elements.\n   The detailed syntax for local-phone elements follows:\n      local-phone
      = [ exit-code ] [ dial-number ]\n      exit-code = phone-string\n                  ;
      this will include elements such as the digit to\n                  ; access
      outside line, the long distance carrier\n                  ; access code, the
      access password to the service,\n                  ; etc...\n      dial-number
      = phone-string\n                  ; this is in many cases composed of different
      elements\n                  ; such as the local phone number, the area code\n
      \                 ; (if needed), the international country code\n                  ;
      (if needed), etc...\n   Note:\n      the \"+\" character is reserved for use
      in global-phone addresses\n      per [7] and MUST NOT be used as the starting
      character in a\n      local-phone string.\n      phone-string = 1*( DTMF / pause
      / tonewait / written-sep )\n      DTMF = ( DIGIT / \"#\" / \"*\" / \"A\" / \"B\"
      / \"C\" / \"D\" )\n                     ; special DTMF codes like \"*\", \"#\",
      \"A\", \"B\",\n                     ; \"C\", \"D\" are defined in [6]\n                     ;
      Important Note: these elements only apply for\n                     ; alphabetic
      strings used in DTMF operations.\n                     ; They are NOT applicable
      for the alphabetic\n                     ; characters that are mapped to digits
      on phone\n                     ; keypads in some countries.\n      pause = \"p\"\n
      \     tonewait = \"w\"\n   The written-sep element is defined in [1], section
      2.1.\n   Note:\n      \"pause\" and \"tonewait\" character interpretation in
      local-phone\n      numbers depends on the specific MTA implementation. Thus
      its exact\n      meaning is not defined here. Both \"pause\" and \"tonewait\"
      are case\n      insensitive.\n   Important Note:\n      A local-phone specification
      is a sequence which should be used\n      only by the destination  MTA specified
      by mta-I-pstn (see [1],\n      section 3). Per [12], other MTAs should transfer
      the message\n      without modifying the LHS.\n"

    - "2.2 The sub-addr-spec element\n   In GSTN service there are cases where a sub-addr-spec
      is required to\n   specify the final destination. In particular there are ISDN\n
      \  subaddresses [7], which apply for various  services, whereas other\n   subaddress
      types may be service specific (see the fax service T.33\n   subaddress [8],
      [2]).\n   Within actual telephone operations there may be cases where different\n
      \  types of subaddresses are used as part of a single complete address.\n   Therefore,
      the sub-addr-spec syntax definition which follows defines\n   the subaddress
      element for the context of ISDN use; the T.33\n   subaddress element is defined
      in [2], section 2.\n   The definition of sub-addr-spec is:\n      sub-addr-spec
      = [ isdn-sep isub-addr ]\n   In detail:\n      isdn-sep = \"/ISUB=\"\n                 ;
      note that \"/ISUB=\" is case INSENSITIVE\n      isub-addr = 1*( DIGIT )\n      isub-addr
      =/ 1*( DIGIT / written-sep )\n   The IANA registration form for sub-addr-spec
      is given in appendix D.2\n"

    - "2.3 The post-sep and post-dial elements\n   In some cases, after the connection
      with the destination GSTN device\n   has been established, a further dialling
      sequence is required to\n   access further services. A typical example is an
      automated menu-\n   driven service using DTMF sequences. These cases may be
      handled using\n   \"post-sep\" and \"post-dial\" elements as defined below:\n
      \     post-sep =  \"/POSTD=\"\n                  ; note that \"/POSTD=\" is
      case INSENSITIVE\n      post-dial = phone-string\n   The IANA registration form
      for post-sep and post-dial are given in\n   appendix D.3\n"

  - "3. The pstn-recipient\n   There are some application where it is valuable to
    supplement the\n   pstn-mbox element with additional details. Common examples
    include\n   the use of originator and/or recipient names and physical addresses,\n
    \  particularly in the context of onramp and/or offramp gateways.\n   The optional
    pstn-recipient element provides support for such\n   details.\n   As an example,
    when an offramp fax gateway is involved, the\n   pstn-recipient element could
    be used to specify the intended\n   recipient on a fax cover page, and the fax
    cover page headers could\n   be qualified using the originator pstn-recipient
    information.\n   In the interest of a compact syntax, the pstn-recipient element
    may\n   be used to support both originator and recipient addresses. For all\n
    \  cases within the ABNF definitions to follow, the elements labelled\n   with
    \"recipient\" may also be used for originator information.\n   The pstn-recipient
    is a sequence of qualif-type1 elements as defined\n   below:\n      pstn-recipient
    = [ recipient-name ]\n                       [ 1*( recipient-qualifier ) ]\n   As
    a consequence, the extended definition of pstn-address becomes:\n      pstn-address
    = pstn-mbox  [ qualif-type1 ]\n      pstn-address =/ pstn-mbox [ pstn-recipient
    ] [ qualif-type1 ]\n   The definition for  qualif-type1 elements is contained
    in [1] section\n   2.\n"

    - "3.1 The recipient-name\n   The recipient-name specifies the personal name of
      the originator\n   and/or recipient:\n      recipient-name = \"/ATTN=\" pers-name\n
      \     pers-name = [ givenname \".\" ]\n                  [ initials \".\" ]\n

      / \"/\" / \":\" / \"=\" / \"?\" )\n      initials = 1*ALPHA\n   Note:\n      the
      \"initials\" element can specify the middle initial which is\n      common in
      some countries; however it is also possible to support\n      multiple initials,
      which may be commonly used in other countries.\n      This allows the complete
      set of givennames initials in any\n      possible combination. See examples
      at section 5.2\n   It is essential to remember that the \"pstn-address\" element
      (in all\n   its components and extensions) MUST strictly follow the \"quoting\n
      \  rules\" specified in the relevant e-mail standards [11], [12].\n   The IANA

      dependent, is\n   thus defined:\n      recipient-qualifier = ( qualif-type1

      Thus, only the strictly needed\n   elements SHOULD be used. The maximum total
      length of the pstn-email\n   MUST in fact not exceed the limits specified in

  - "6. Conclusion\n   This proposal creates a standard set of extensions for GSTN\n
    \  addresses, enriching the existing minimal specification [1]. The\n   proposal
    is consistent with existing e-mail standards, but allows a\n   more detailed GSTN
    address specification, including per originator\n   and/or recipient specific
    elements. The IANA registration mechanism\n   to permit the addition of new services
    and qualifiers using the GSTN\n   addresses is also provided.\n"
  title: 6. Conclusion
- contents:
  - "7. Security Considerations\n   This document specifies a means by which GSTN
    addresses and more can\n   be encoded into e-mail addresses. Since e-mail routing
    is determined\n   by Domain Name System (DNS) data, a successful attack to DNS
    could\n   disseminate tampered information, which causes e-mail messages to be\n
    \  diverted via some MTA or Gateway where the security of the software\n   has
    been compromised.\n   There are several means by which an attacker might be able
    to deliver\n   incorrect mail routing information to a client. These include:
    (a)\n   compromise of a DNS server, (b) generating a counterfeit response to\n
    \  a client's DNS query, (c) returning incorrect \"additional\n   information\"
    in response to an unrelated query. Clients SHOULD ensure\n   that mail routing
    are based only on authoritative answers. Once DNS\n   Security mechanisms [7]
    become more widely deployed, clients SHOULD\n   employ those mechanisms to verify
    the authenticity and integrity of\n   mail routing records.\n   Some GSTN service
    require dialing of private codes, like Personal\n   Identification Numbers, to
    dial a G3 fax recipient or to access\n   special services. As e-mail addresses
    are transmitted without\n   encoding over the MTAs transport service, this could
    allow\n   unauthorized people to gain access to these codes when used inside\n
    \  local-phone. More over these codes might appear in some cases in the\n   originator
    and/or recipient addresses on cover pages delivered via\n   offramp gateways to
    G3 fax recipients. Senders SHOULD be provided\n   methods to prevent this disclosure,
    like code encryption, or\n   masquerading techniques: out-of-band communication
    of authorization\n   information or use of encrypted data in special fields are
    the\n   available non-standard techniques.\n"
