  - "                       Quote of the Day Protocol\nThis RFC specifies a standard
    for the ARPA Internet community.  Hosts on\nthe ARPA Internet that choose to implement
    a Quote of the Day Protocol\nare expected to adopt and implement this standard.\nA
    useful debugging and measurement tool is a quote of the day service.\nA quote
    of the day service simply sends a short message without regard\nto the input.\nTCP
    Based Character Generator Service\n   One quote of the day service is defined
    as a connection based\n   application on TCP.  A server listens for TCP connections
    on TCP port\n   17.  Once a connection is established a short message is sent
    out the\n   connection (and any data received is thrown away).  The service\n
    \  closes the connection after sending the quote.\nUDP Based Character Generator
    Service\n   Another quote of the day service is defined as a datagram based\n
    \  application on UDP.  A server listens for UDP datagrams on UDP port\n   17.
    \ When a datagram is received, an answering datagram is sent\n   containing a
    quote (the data in the received datagram is ignored).\nQuote Syntax\n   There
    is no specific syntax for the quote.  It is recommended that it\n   be limited
    to the ASCII printing characters, space, carriage return,\n   and line feed.  The
    quote may be just one or up to several lines, but\n   it should be less than 512
    characters.\n"
