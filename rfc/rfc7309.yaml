  - "1.  Introduction\n   In many existing Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS) deployments
    based\n   on [RFC4762], pseudowire (PW) connectivity offers no Provider Edge\n
    \  (PE) node redundancy, or offers PE node redundancy with only a single\n   domain.
    \ This deployment approach incurs a high risk of service\n   interruption, since
    at least one domain will not offer PE node\n   redundancy.  This document describes
    an inter-domain VPLS solution\n   that provides PE node redundancy across domains.
    \ The redundancy\n   mechanism will provide PE node redundancy and link redundancy
    in both\n   domains.  The PE throughout the document refers to a routing and\n
    \  bridging capable PE defined in [RFC4762], Section 10.  The domain in\n   this
    document refers to an autonomous system (AS), or other\n   administrative domains.\n
    \  The solution relies on the use of the Inter-Chassis Communication\n   Protocol
    (ICCP) [RFC7275] to coordinate between the two redundant\n   edge nodes, and use
    of PW Preferential Forwarding Status Bit\n   [RFC6870] to negotiate the PW status.
    \ There is no change to any\n   protocol message formats and no new protocol options
    are introduced.\n   This solution is a description of reusing existing protocol
    building\n   blocks to achieve the desired function, but also defines\n   implementation
    behavior necessary for the function to work.\n"

  - "3.  Motivation\n   Inter-AS VPLS offerings are widely deployed in service provider\n
    \  networks today.  Typically, the Autonomous System Border Router\n   (ASBR)
    and associated physical links that connect the domains carry a\n   multitude of
    services.  As such, it is important to provide PE node\n   and link redundancy,
    to ensure high service availability and meet the\n   end customer service level
    agreements (SLAs).\n   Several current deployments of inter-AS VPLS are implemented
    like\n   inter-AS option A as described in [RFC4364], Section 10, where the\n
    \  Virtual Local Area Network (VLAN) is used to hand-off the services\n   between
    two domains.  In these deployments, PE node/link redundancy\n   is achieved using
    Multi-Chassis Link Aggregation (MC-LAG) and ICCP\n   [RFC7275].  This, however,
    places two restrictions on the\n   interconnection: the two domains must be interconnected
    using\n   Ethernet links, and the links must be homogeneous, i.e., of the same\n
    \  speed, in order to be aggregated.  These two conditions cannot always\n   be
    guaranteed in live deployments.  For instance, there are many\n   scenarios where
    the interconnection between the domains uses packet\n   over Synchronous Optical
    Networking (SONET) / Synchronous Digital\n   Hierarchy (SDH), thereby ruling out
    the applicability of MC-LAG as a\n   redundancy mechanism.  As such, from a technical
    point of view, it is\n   desirable to use PWs to interconnect the VPLS domains,
    and to offer\n   resiliency using PW redundancy mechanisms.\n   Multiprotocol
    Border Gateway Protocol (MP-BGP) can be used for VPLS\n   inter-domain protection,
    as described in [RFC6074], using either\n   option B or option C inter-AS models.
    \ However, with this solution,\n   the protection time relies on BGP control-plane
    convergence.  In\n   certain deployments, with tight SLA requirements on availability,\n
    \  this mechanism may not provide the desired failover time\n   characteristics.
    \ Furthermore, in certain situations MP-BGP is not\n   deployed for VPLS.  The
    redundancy solution described in this\n   document reuses ICCP [RFC7275] and PW
    redundancy [RFC6718] to provide\n   fast convergence.\n   Furthermore, in the
    case where label switched multicast is not used\n   for VPLS multicast [RFC7117],
    the solution described here provides a\n   better behavior compared to inter-AS
    option B: with option B, each PE\n   must perform ingress replication to all other
    PEs in its local as\n   well as the remote domain.  Whereas, with the ICCP solution,
    the PE\n   only replicates to local PEs and to the ASBR.  The ASBR then sends\n
    \  traffic point to point to the remote ASBR, and the remote ASBR\n   replicates
    to its local PEs.  As a result, the load of replication is\n   distributed and
    is more efficient than option B.\n   Two PW redundancy modes defined in [RFC6718],
    namely independent mode\n   and master/slave mode, are applicable in this solution.
    \ In order to\n   maintain control-plane separation between two domains, the\n
    \  independent mode is preferred by operators.  The master/slave mode\n   provides
    some enhanced capabilities and, hence, is included in this\n   document.\n"

    application procedures are described in Section 9.1 of\n   [RFC7275].  When a
    PE node encounters a failure, the other PE takes\n   over.  This document reuses
    the PW redundancy mechanism defined in\n   [RFC7275], with new ICCP switchover
    conditions as specified in\n   following section.\n   There are two PW redundancy
    modes defined in [RFC6870]: Independent\n   mode and Master/Slave mode.  For the
    inter-domain four-PW scenario,\n   it is required that PEs ensure that the same
    mode be supported on the\n   two ICCP peers in the same RG.  This can be achieved
    using manual\n   configuration at the ICCP peers.  Other methods for ensuring\n

      PW1\n   and PW2 will be in standby state.\n"
    title: 5.2.  Inter-domain Redundancy with Two PWs
  - contents:
    - "5.3.  Inter-domain Redundancy with Four PWs\n   In this use case, there are
      two options to provide protection: 1:1\n   and 3:1 protection.  The inter-domain
      PWs that connect to the same PE\n   should have proper PW priority to advertise
      the same active/standby\n   state.  For example, in Figure 2, both PW1 and PW3
      are connected to\n   PE3 and should advertise active/standby state.\n   For
      the 1:1 protection model, the operation would be as follows:\n   o  ICCP deployment
      option: ICCP is deployed on VPLS edge nodes in\n      both domains;\n   o  PW
      redundancy mode: independent mode only;\n   o  Protection architectures: 1:1
      (1 standby, 1 active).\n   The switchover rules described in Section 5.1 apply.
      \ In this case,\n   the operators do not need to do any coordination of the
      inter-domain\n   PW priority.  The PE detecting one PW DOWN SHOULD set the other
      PW to\n   STANDBY if available, and then synchronize the updated state to its\n
      \  ICCP peer.  When a PE detects that the PWs from the ICCP peer PE are\n   DOWN
      or STANDBY, it SHOULD switchover as described in Section 5.1.1.\n   There are
      two variants of the 3:1 protection model.  We will refer to\n   them as options
      A and B.  The implementation MUST support option A\n   and MAY support option
      B.  Option B will be useful when the two\n   legacy PEs in one domain do not
      support the function in this\n   document.  The two legacy PEs still need to
      support PW redundancy\n   defined in [RFC6870] and be configured as slave node.\n
      \  For option A of the 3:1 protection model, the support of the Request\n   Switchover
      status bit [RFC6870] is required.  The operation is as\n   follows:\n   o  ICCP
      deployment option: ICCP is deployed on VPLS edge nodes in\n      both domains;\n
      \  o  PW redundancy mode: Independent mode with 'request switchover' bit\n      support;\n
      \  o  Protection architectures: 3:1 (3 standby, 1 active).\n   In this case,
      the procedure on the PE for the PW failure is per\n   Section 6.3 of [RFC6870]
      and with the following additions:\n   o  When the PE detects failure of the
      active inter-domain PW, it\n      SHOULD switch to the other local standby inter-domain
      PW if\n      available, and send an updated LDP PW status message with the\n
      \     'request switchover' bit set on that local standby inter-domain PW\n      to
      the remote PE;\n   o  Local and remote PE SHOULD also update the new PW status
      to their\n      ICCP peers, respectively, in Application Data Messages with
      the\n      PW-RED Synchronization Request TLV for corresponding service, so\n
      \     as to synchronize the latest PW status on both PE sides.\n   o  While
      waiting for the acknowledgement, the PE that sends the\n      'request switchover'
      bit may receive a switchover request from its\n      ICCP peer's PW remote endpoint
      by virtue of the ICCP\n      synchronization.  The PE MUST compare IP addresses
      with that PW\n      remote peer.  The PE with a higher IP address SHOULD ignore
      the\n      request and continue to wait for the acknowledgement from its peer\n
      \     in the remote domain.  The PE with the lower IP address SHOULD\n      clear
      the 'request switchover' bit and set the 'Preferential\n      Forwarding' local
      status bit, and update the PW status to ICCP\n      peer.\n   o  The remote
      PE receiving the 'request switchover' bit SHOULD\n      acknowledge the request
      and activate the PW only when it is ready\n      to take over as described in
      Section 5.1; otherwise, it SHOULD\n      ignore the request.\n   The PE node
      isolation failure and PE node failure is described in\n   Section 5.1.\n   For
      option B of the 3:1 protection model, master/slave mode support\n   is required
      and should be as follows:\n   o  ICCP deployment option: ICCP is deployed on
      VPLS edge nodes in\n      only one domain;\n   o  PW redundancy mode: master/slave
      only;\n   o  Protection architectures: 3:1 (3 standby, 1 active).\n   When master/slave
      PW redundancy mode is employed, the network\n   operators of two domains must
      agree on which domain PEs will be\n   master, and configure the devices accordingly.
      \ The inter-domain PWs\n   that connect to one PE should have higher PW priority
      than the PWs on\n   the other PE in the same RG.  The procedure on the PE for
      PW failure\n   is as follows:\n   o  The PE with higher PW priority should only
      enable one PW active,\n      and the other PWs should be in the standby state.\n
      \  o  When the PE detects an active PW DOWN, it SHOULD enable the other\n      local
      standby PW to be active with preference.  Only when two\n      inter-domain
      PWs connected to the PE are DOWN, the ICCP peer PE in\n      the same RG SHOULD
      switchover as described in Section 5.1.\n   The PE node isolation failure and
      PE node failure are described in\n   Section 5.1.\n"

    at the two PW\n   endpoints.  If the provisioning is inconsistent, then the inter-\n
    \  domain redundancy mechanism may not work properly.\n"

  - "7.  Security Considerations\n   Besides the security properties of [RFC7275]
    for the ICCP control\n   plane, and [RFC4762] and [RFC6870] for the PW control
    plane, this\n   document has additional security considerations for the ICCP control\n
    \  plane.\n   In this document, ICCP is deployed between two PEs or ASBRs.  The
    two\n   PEs or ASBRs should only be connected by a network that is well\n   managed
    and whose service levels and availability are highly\n   monitored.  This should
    be ensured by the operator.\n   The state flapping on the inter-domain and intra-domain
    PW may cause\n   security threats or be exploited to create denial-of-service
    attacks.\n   For example, excessive PW state flapping (e.g., by malicious peer\n
    \  PE's implementation) may lead to excessive ICCP exchanges.\n   Implementations
    SHOULD provide mechanisms to perform control-plane\n   policing and mitigate such
    types of attacks.\n"
