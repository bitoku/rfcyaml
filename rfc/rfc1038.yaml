    \  The\n      classification level of an IP datagram should be within the range\n\
    \      of levels for which the host is accredited.  The protection\n      authorities\
    \ flags should be one for all authorities under whose\n      rules the datagram\
    \ should be protected.\n      b.  Input.  In the specific case where a multi-level\
    \ or controlled\n      host is accredited to directly interface with an unclassified\n\
    \      environment, the host may accept IP datagrams without a basic\n      security\
    \ option.  Such datagrams should be assumed to be\n      implicitly labelled unclassified,\
    \ GENSER, and should be so\n      labelled explicitly if they are later output.\
    \  In all other cases,\n      the IP datagrams should have the basic security\
    \ option on input,\n      and the out-of-range procedure should be followed if\
    \ it is not.\n   There are two cases to be considered where the option is present.\n\
    \   The first case is where the system environment permits the values in\n   the\
    \ option to be trusted to be correct for some range of values; the\n   second\
    \ is where the values cannot be trusted to be correct.  For each\n   multi-level\
    \ or controlled host, every input channel for IP datagrams\n   must be considered\
    \ and classed appropriately.  If a channel does have\n   a trusted range, then\
    \ the values of both the classification level and\n   the protection authorities\
    \ are checked to insure that they fall\n   within that range and the range of\
    \ accredited values for the\n   receiving host.  If within both ranges, the IP\
    \ datagram is accepted\n   for further processing; otherwise the out-of-range\
    \ procedure is\n   followed.  If the label cannot be trusted, then the receiving\
    \ host\n   must possess some accredited means of knowing what the correct\n  \
    \ marking should be (e.g., a trusted channel to a system-high host at a\n   known\
    \ level).  On receipt of an IP datagram, the host compares the\n   actual values\
    \ in the option to the correct values.  If the values\n   match, the datagram\
    \ is accepted for further processing; otherwise,\n   the out-of-range procedure\
    \ is followed.\n"

    \ sent to the\n      originating host with the code field set to 1 (one) to indicate\n\
