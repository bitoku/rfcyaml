    \ Multicast-Sparse Mode (PIM-SM) domain.\n"
- title: 1. Introduction
  contents:
  - "1. Introduction\n   PIM-SM, as defined in RFC 2362, allows for only a single\
    \ active RP\n   per group, and as such the decision of optimal RP placement can\n\
    \   become problematic for a multi-regional network deploying PIM-SM.\n   Anycast\
    \ RP relaxes an important constraint in PIM-SM, namely, that\n   there can be\
    \ only one group to RP mapping can be active at any time.\n   The single mapping\
    \ property has several implications, including\n   traffic concentration, lack\
    \ of scalable register decapsulation (when\n   using the shared tree), slow convergence\
    \ when an active RP fails,\n   possible sub-optimal forwarding of multicast packets,\
    \ and distant RP\n   dependencies.  These properties of PIM-SM have been demonstrated\
    \ in\n   native continental or inter-continental scale multicast deployments.\n\
    \   As a result, it is clear that ISP backbones require a mechanism that\n   allows\
    \ definition of multiple active RPs per group in a single PIM-SM\n   domain. \
    \ Further, any such mechanism should also address the issues\n   addressed above.\n\
    \   The mechanism described here is intended to address the need for\n   better\
    \ fail-over (convergence time) and sharing of the register\n   decapsulation load\
    \ (again, when using the shared-tree) among RPs in a\n   domain.  It is primarily\
    \ intended for applications within those\n   networks using MBGP, Multicast Source\
    \ Discovery Protocol [MSDP] and\n   PIM-SM protocols, for native multicast deployment,\
    \ although it is not\n   limited to those protocols.  In particular, Anycast RP\
    \ is applicable\n   in any PIM-SM network that also supports MSDP (MSDP is required\
    \ so\n   that the various RPs in the domain maintain a consistent view of the\n\
    \   sources that are active).  Note however, a domain deploying Anycast\n   RP\
    \ is not required to run MBGP.  Finally, a general requirement of\n   the Anycast\
    \ RP scheme is that the anycast address MUST NOT be used as\n   the RP address\
    \ in the RP's SA messages.\n   The keywords MUST, MUST NOT, MAY, OPTIONAL, REQUIRED,\
    \ RECOMMENDED,\n   SHALL, SHALL NOT, SHOULD, SHOULD NOT are to be interpreted\
    \ as defined\n   in BCP 14, RFC 2119 [RFC2119].\n"
- title: 2. Problem Definition
  contents:
  - "2. Problem Definition\n   The anycast RP solution provides a solution for both\
    \ fast fail-over\n   and shared-tree load balancing among any number of active\
    \ RPs in a\n   domain.\n"
- title: 2.1. Traffic Concentration and Distributing Decapsulation Load Among RPs
  contents:
  - "2.1. Traffic Concentration and Distributing Decapsulation Load Among RPs\n  \
    \ While PIM-SM allows for multiple RPs to be defined for a given group,\n   only\
    \ one group to RP mapping can be active at a given time.  A\n   traditional deployment\
    \ mechanism for balancing register decapsulation\n   load between multiple RPs\
    \ covering the multicast group space is to\n   split up the 224.0.0.0/4 space\
    \ between multiple defined RPs.  This is\n   an acceptable solution as long as\
    \ multicast traffic remains low, but\n   has problems as multicast traffic increases,\
    \ especially because the\n   network operator defining group space split between\
    \ RPs does not\n   always have a priori knowledge of traffic distribution between\n\
    \   groups.  This can be overcome via periodic reconfigurations, but\n   operational\
    \ considerations cause this type of solution to scale\n   poorly.\n"
- title: 2.2. Sub-optimal Forwarding of Multicast Packets
  contents:
  - "2.2. Sub-optimal Forwarding of Multicast Packets\n   When a single RP serves\
    \ a given multicast group, all joins to that\n   group will be sent to that RP\
    \ regardless of the topological distance\n   between the RP and the sources and\
    \ receivers.  Initial data will be\n   sent towards the RP also until configured\
    \ the shortest path tree\n   switch threshold is reached, or the data will always\
    \ be sent towards\n   the RP if the network is configured to always use the RP\
    \ rooted\n   shared tree.  This holds true even if all the sources and the\n \
    \  receivers are in any given single region, and RP is topologically\n   distant\
    \ from the sources and the receivers.  This is an artifact of\n   the dynamic\
    \ nature of multicast group members, and of the fact that\n   operators may not\
    \ always have a priori knowledge of the topological\n   placement of the group\
    \ members.\n   Taken together, these effects can mean that (for example) although\n\
    \   all the sources and receivers of a given group are in Europe, they\n   are\
    \ joining towards the RP in the USA and the data will be traversing\n   a relatively\
    \ expensive pipe(s) twice, once to get to RP, and back\n   down the RP rooted\
    \ tree again, creating inefficient use of expensive\n   resources.\n"
- title: 2.3. Distant RP Dependencies
  contents:
  - "2.3. Distant RP Dependencies\n   As outlined above, a single active RP per group\
    \ may cause local\n   sources and receivers to become dependent on a topologically\
    \ distant\n   RP.  In addition, when multiple RPs are configured, there can be\n\
    \   considerable convergence delay involved in switching to the backup\n   RP.\
    \  This delay may exist independent of the toplogical location of\n   the primary\
    \ and backup RPs.\n"
- title: 3. Solution
  contents:
  - "3. Solution\n   Given the problem set outlined above, a good solution would allow\
    \ an\n   operator to configure multiple RPs per group, and distribute those\n\
    \   RPs in a topologically significant manner to the sources and\n   receivers.\n"
- title: 3.1. Mechanisms
  contents:
  - "3.1. Mechanisms\n   All the RPs serving a given group or set of groups are configured\n\
    \   with an identical anycast address, using a numbered interface on the\n   RPs\
    \ (frequently a logical interface such as a loopback is used).  RPs\n   then advertise\
    \ group to RP mappings using this interface address.\n   This will cause group\
    \ members (senders) to join (register) towards\n   the topologically closest RP.\
    \  RPs MSDP peer with each other using an\n   address unique to each RP.  Since\
    \ the anycast address is not a unique\n   address (by definition), a router MUST\
    \ NOT choose the anycast unicast\n   address as the router ID, as this can prevent\
    \ peerings and/or\n   adjacencies from being established.\n   In summary then,\
    \ the following steps are required:\n"
- title: 3.1.1. Create the set of group-to-anycast-RP-address mappings
  contents:
  - "3.1.1. Create the set of group-to-anycast-RP-address mappings\n   The first step\
    \ is to create the set of group-to-anycast-RP-address\n   mappings to be used\
    \ in the domain.  Each RP participating in an\n   anycast RP set must be configured\
    \ with a consistent set of group to\n   RP address mappings.  This mapping will\
    \ be used by the non-RP routers\n   in the domain.\n"
- title: 3.1.2. Configure each RP for the group range with the anycast RP address
  contents:
  - "3.1.2. Configure each RP for the group range with the anycast RP address\n  \
    \ The next step is to configure each RP for the group range with the\n   anycast\
    \ RP address.  If a dynamic mechanism, such as auto-RP or the\n   PIMv2 bootstrap\
    \ mechanism, is being used to advertise group to RP\n   mappings, the anycast\
    \ IP address should be used for the RP address.\n"
- title: 3.1.3. Configure MSDP peerings between each of the anycast RPs in the
  contents:
  - "3.1.3. Configure MSDP peerings between each of the anycast RPs in the\n   set\n\
    \   Unlike the group to RP mapping advertisements, MSDP peerings must use\n  \
    \ an IP address that is unique to the endpoints; that is, the MSDP\n   peering\
    \ endpoints MUST use a unicast rather than anycast address.  A\n   general guideline\
    \ is to follow the addressing of the BGP peerings,\n   e.g., loopbacks for iBGP\
    \ peering, physical interface addresses for\n   eBGP peering.  Note that the anycast\
    \ address MUST NOT be used as the\n   RP address in SA messages (as this would\
    \ case the peer-RPF check to\n   fail).\n"

  contents:
  - "3.1.4. Configure the non-RP's with the group-to-anycast-RP-address\n   mappings\n\
    \   Finally, each non-RP router must learn the set of group to RP\n   mappings.\
    \  This could be done via static configuration, auto-RP, or\n   by PIMv2 bootstrap\
    \ mechanism.\n"

  contents:
  - "3.1.5. Ensure that the anycast IP address is reachable by all routers in\n  \
    \ the domain\n   This is typically accomplished by causing each RP to inject the\
    \ /32\n   into the domain's IGP.\n"
- title: 3.2. Interaction with MSDP Peer-RPF check
  contents:
  - "3.2. Interaction with MSDP Peer-RPF check\n   Each MSDP peer receives and forwards\
    \ the message away from the RP\n   address in a \"peer-RPF flooding\" fashion.\
    \  The notion of peer-RPF\n   flooding is with respect to forwarding SA messages\
    \ [MSDP].  The BGP\n   routing tables are examined to determine which peer is\
    \ the next hop\n   towards the originating RP of the SA message.  Such a peer\
    \ is called\n   an \"RPF peer\".  See [MSDP] for details of the Peer-RPF check.\n"
- title: 3.3. State Implications
  contents:
  - "3.3. State Implications\n   It should be noted that using MSDP in this way forces\
    \ the creation of\n   (S,G) state along the path from the receiver to the source.\
    \  This\n   state may not be present if a single RP was used and receivers were\n\
    \   forced to stay on the shared tree.\n"
- title: 4. Security considerations
  contents:
  - "4. Security considerations\n   Since the solution described here makes heavy\
    \ use of anycast\n   addressing, care must be taken to avoid spoofing.  In particular\n\
    \   unicast routing and PIM RPs must be protected.\n"
- title: 4.1. Unicast Routing
  contents:
  - "4.1. Unicast Routing\n   Both internal and external unicast routing can be weakly\
    \ protected\n   with keyed MD5 [RFC1828], as implemented in an internal protocol\
    \ such\n   as OSPF [RFC2328] or in BGP [RFC2385].  More generally,  IPSEC\n  \
    \ [RFC2401] could be used to provide protocol integrity for the unicast\n   routing\
    \ system.\n"
- title: 4.1.1. Effects of Unicast Routing Instability
  contents:
  - "4.1.1. Effects of Unicast Routing Instability\n   While not a security issue,\
    \ it is worth noting that if unicast\n   routing is unstable, then the actual\
    \ RP that source or receiver is\n   using will be subject to the same instability.\n"
- title: 4.2. Multicast Protocol Integrity
  contents:
  - "4.2. Multicast Protocol Integrity\n   The mechanisms described in [RFC2362] should\
    \ be used to provide\n   protocol message integrity protection and group-wise\
    \ message origin\n   authentication.\n"
