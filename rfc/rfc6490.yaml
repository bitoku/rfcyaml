- title: 2.1.  Trust Anchor Locator Format
  contents:
  - "2.1.  Trust Anchor Locator Format\n   This document does not propose a new format\
    \ for trust anchor\n   material.  A trust anchor in the RPKI is represented by\
    \ a self-signed\n   X.509 Certification Authority (CA) certificate, a format commonly\n\
    \   used in PKIs and widely supported by RP software.  This document\n   specifies\
    \ a format for data used to retrieve and verify the\n   authenticity of a trust\
    \ anchor in a very simple fashion.  That data\n   is referred to as the TAL.\n\
    \   The motivation for defining the TAL is to enable selected data in the\n  \
    \ trust anchor to change, without needing to effect redistribution of\n   the\
    \ trust anchor per se.  In the RPKI, certificates contain\n   extensions that\
    \ represent Internet Number Resources (INRs) [RFC3779].\n   The set of INRs associated\
    \ with an entity likely will change over\n   time.  Thus, if one were to use the\
    \ common PKI convention of\n   distributing a trust anchor to RPs in a secure\
    \ fashion, this\n   procedure would need to be repeated whenever the INR set for\
    \ the\n   trust anchor changed.  By distributing the TAL (in a secure fashion)\n\
    \   instead of the trust anchor, this problem is avoided, i.e., the TAL\n   is\
    \ constant so long as the trust anchor's public key and its location\n   do not\
    \ change.\n   The TAL is analogous to the TrustAnchorInfo data structure [RFC5914]\n\
    \   adopted as a PKIX standard.  That standard could be used to represent\n  \
    \ the TAL, if one defined an rsync URI extension for that data\n   structure.\
    \  However, the TAL format was adopted by RPKI implementors\n   prior to the PKIX\
    \ trust anchor work, and the RPKI implementer\n   community has elected to utilize\
    \ the TAL format, rather than define\n   the requisite extension.  The community\
    \ also prefers the simplicity\n   of the ASCII encoding of the TAL versus the\
    \ binary (ASN.1) encoding\n   for TrustAnchorInfo.\n   The TAL is an ordered sequence\
    \ of:\n   1) An rsync URI [RFC5781],\n   2) A <CRLF> or <LF> line break, and\n\
    \   3) A subjectPublicKeyInfo [RFC5280] in DER format [X.509], encoded in\n  \
    \    Base64 (see Section 4 of [RFC4648]).\n"
- title: 2.2.  TAL and Trust Anchor Certificate Considerations
  contents:
  - "2.2.  TAL and Trust Anchor Certificate Considerations\n   The rsync URI in the\
    \ TAL MUST reference a single object.  It MUST NOT\n   reference a directory or\
    \ any other form of collection of objects.\n   The referenced object MUST be a\
    \ self-signed CA certificate that\n   conforms to the RPKI certificate profile\
    \ [RFC6487].  This certificate\n   is the trust anchor in certification path discovery\
    \ [RFC4158] and\n   validation [RFC5280] [RFC3779].\n   The validity interval\
    \ of this trust anchor SHOULD reflect the\n   anticipated period of stability\
    \ for the particular set of INRs that\n   are associated with the putative trust\
    \ anchor.\n   The INR extension(s) of this trust anchor MUST contain a non-empty\n\
    \   set of number resources.  It MUST NOT use the \"inherit\" form of the\n  \
    \ INR extension(s).  The INR set described in this certificate is the\n   set\
    \ of number resources for which the issuing entity is offering\n   itself as a\
    \ putative trust anchor in the RPKI [RFC6480].\n   The public key used to verify\
    \ the trust anchor MUST be the same as\n   the subjectPublicKeyInfo in the CA\
    \ certificate and in the TAL.\n   The trust anchor MUST contain a stable key.\
    \  This key MUST NOT change\n   when the certificate is reissued due to changes\
    \ in the INR\n   extension(s), when the certificate is renewed prior to expiration\
    \ or\n   for any reason other than a key change.\n   Because the public key in\
    \ the TAL and the trust anchor MUST be\n   stable, this motivates operation of\
    \ that CA in an off-line mode.\n   Thus the entity that issues the trust anchor\
    \ SHOULD issue a\n   subordinate CA certificate that contains the same INRs (via\
    \ the use\n   of the \"inherit\" option in the INR extensions of the subordinate\n\
    \   certificate).  This allows the entity that issues the trust anchor to\n  \
    \ keep the corresponding private key of this certificate off-line,\n   while issuing\
    \ all relevant child certificates under the immediate\n   subordinate CA.  This\
    \ measure also allows the Certificate Revocation\n   List (CRL) issued by that\
    \ entity to be used to revoke the subordinate\n   CA certificate in the event\
    \ of suspected key compromise of this\n   potentially more vulnerable online operational\
    \ key pair.\n   The trust anchor MUST be published at a stable URI.  When the\
    \ trust\n   anchor is reissued for any reason, the replacement CA certificate\n\
    \   MUST be accessible using the same URI.\n   Because the trust anchor is a self-signed\
    \ certificate, there is no\n   corresponding CRL that can be used to revoke it,\
    \ nor is there a\n   manifest [RFC6486] that lists this certificate.\n   If an\
    \ entity wishes to withdraw a self-signed CA certificate as a\n   putative trust\
    \ anchor for any reason, including key rollover, the\n   entity MUST remove the\
    \ object from the location referenced in the\n   TAL.\n"

- title: 3.  Relying Party Use
  contents:
  - "3.  Relying Party Use\n   In order to use the TAL to retrieve and validate a\
    \ (putative) trust\n   anchor, an RP SHOULD:\n   1. Retrieve the object referenced\
    \ by the URI contained in the TAL.\n   2. Confirm that the retrieved object is\
    \ a current, self-signed RPKI\n      CA certificate that conforms to the profile\
    \ as specified in\n      [RFC6487].\n   3.  Confirm that the public key in the\
    \ TAL matches the public key in\n      the retrieved object.\n   4. Perform other\
    \ checks, as deemed appropriate (locally), to ensure\n      that the RP is willing\
    \ to accept the entity publishing this self-\n      signed CA certificate to be\
    \ a trust anchor.  These checks apply to\n      the validity of attestations made\
    \ in the context of the RPKI,\n      relating to all resources described in the\
    \ INR extension of this\n      certificate.\n   An RP SHOULD perform these functions\
    \ for each instance of TAL that it\n   is holding for this purpose every time\
    \ the RP performs a\n   re-synchronization across the local repository cache.\
    \  In any case,\n   an RP also SHOULD perform these functions prior to the expiration\
    \ of\n   the locally cached copy of the retrieved trust anchor referenced by\n\
    \   the TAL.\n"
- title: 4.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "4.  Security Considerations\n   Compromise of a trust anchor private key permits\
    \ unauthorized parties\n   to masquerade as a trust anchor, with potentially severe\n\
    \   consequences.  Reliance on an inappropriate or incorrect trust anchor\n  \
    \ has similar potentially severe consequences.\n   This TAL does not directly\
    \ provide a list of resources covered by the\n   referenced self-signed CA certificate.\
    \  Instead, the RP is referred\n   to the trust anchor itself and the INR extension(s)\
    \ within this\n   certificate.  This provides necessary operational flexibility,\
    \ but it\n   also allows the certificate issuer to claim to be authoritative for\n\
    \   any resource.  Relying parties should either have great confidence in\n  \
    \ the issuers of such certificates that they are configuring as trust\n   anchors,\
    \ or they should issue their own self-signed certificate as a\n   trust anchor\
    \ and, in doing so, impose constraints on the subordinate\n   certificates.  For\
    \ more information on this approach, see [TA-MGMT].\n"
