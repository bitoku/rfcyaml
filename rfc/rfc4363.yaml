  - "Abstract\n   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)\n
    \  for use with network management protocols in TCP/IP-based internets.\n   In
    particular, it defines two MIB modules for managing the\n   capabilities of MAC
    bridges defined by the IEEE 802.1D-1998 (TM) MAC\n   Bridges and the IEEE 802.1Q-2003
    (TM) Virtual LAN (VLAN) standards\n   for bridging between Local Area Network
    (LAN) segments.  One MIB\n   module defines objects for managing the 'Traffic
    Classes' and\n   'Enhanced Multicast Filtering' components of IEEE 802.1D-1998
    and\n   P802.1t-2001 (TM).  The other MIB module defines objects for managing\n
    \  VLANs, as specified in IEEE 802.1Q-2003, P802.1u (TM), and P802.1v\n   (TM).\n
    \  Provisions are made for support of transparent bridging.  Provisions\n   are
    also made so that these objects apply to bridges connected by\n   subnetworks
    other than LAN segments.\n   This memo supplements RFC 4188 and obsoletes RFC
    2674.\n"

    the documents that describe the current\n   Internet-Standard Management Framework,
    please refer to section 7 of\n   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].\n   Managed objects are accessed
    via a virtual information store, termed\n   the Management Information Base or
    MIB.  MIB objects are generally\n   accessed through the Simple Network Management
    Protocol (SNMP).\n   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined
    in the\n   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB\n
    \  module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,\n   RFC
    2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580\n   [RFC2580].\n"

  - "2.  Overview\n   A common device present in many networks is the Bridge.  This
    device\n   is used to connect Local Area Network segments below the network\n
    \  layer.  These devices are often known as 'layer 2 switches'.\n   The transparent
    method of bridging is defined by IEEE 802.1D-1998\n   [802.1D].  Managed objects
    for transparent bridging are defined in\n   the BRIDGE-MIB [BRIDGE-MIB].\n   The
    original IEEE 802.1D is augmented by IEEE 802.1Q-2003 [802.1Q] to\n   provide
    support for 'virtual bridged LANs' where a single bridged\n   physical LAN network
    may be used to support multiple logical bridged\n   LANs, each of which offers
    a service approximately the same as that\n   defined by IEEE 802.1D.  Such virtual
    LANs (VLANs) are an integral\n   feature of switched LAN networks.  A VLAN can
    be viewed as a group of\n   end-stations on multiple LAN segments and can communicate
    as if they\n   were on a single LAN.  IEEE 802.1Q defines port-based Virtual LANs\n
    \  where membership is determined by the bridge port on which data\n   frames
    are received, and port-and-protocol-based Virtual LANs where\n   membership is
    determined by the bridge port on which frames are\n   received and the protocol
    identifier of the frame.  This memo defines\n   the objects needed for the management
    of port-based VLANs in bridge\n   entities.\n   This memo supplements RFC 4188
    [BRIDGE-MIB] and obsoletes RFC 2674\n   [RFC2674].\n"
  - contents:
    - "2.1.  Scope\n   The MIB modules defined in this document include a comprehensive
      set\n   of managed objects that attempts to match the set defined in IEEE\n
      \  802.1D and IEEE 802.1Q.  However, to be consistent with the spirit of\n   the
      SNMP Framework, a subjective judgement was made to omit the\n   objects from
      those standards most 'costly' to implement in an agent\n   and least 'essential'
      for fault and configuration management.  The\n   omissions are described in
      Section 3 below.\n   Historical note:\n   The original BRIDGE-MIB [RFC1493]
      used the following principles for\n   determining inclusion of an object in
      the BRIDGE-MIB module:\n   (1)   Start with a small set of essential objects
      and add only as\n         further objects are needed.\n   (2)   Require that
      objects be essential for either fault or\n         configuration management.\n
      \  (3)   Consider evidence of current use and/or utility.\n   (4)   Limit the
      total number of objects.\n   (5)   Exclude objects that are simply derivable
      from others in this\n         or other MIBs.\n   (6)   Avoid causing critical
      sections to be heavily instrumented.\n         The guideline that was followed
      is one counter per critical\n         section per layer.\n"

        [802.1D].  It also details those objects that are\n   not considered necessary
        in this MIB module.\n   Some objects defined by IEEE 802.1D-1998 have been
        included in the\n   virtual bridge MIB module rather than this one: entries
        in\n   dot1qTpGroupTable, dot1qForwardAllTable, and\n   dot1qForwardUnregisteredTable

  - contents:
    - "3.3.  Textual Conventions\n   Various Working Groups have defined standards-track
      MIB documents\n   (for example, [RFC2613] and [RFC3318]), that contain objects
      and\n   Textual Conventions to represent a Virtual Local Area Network\n   Identifier
      (VLAN-ID) [802.1Q].  New definitions are showing up in\n   various documents
      (for example, [RFC4323] and [RFC4149]).\n   Unfortunately, the result is a set
      of different definitions for the\n   same piece of management information.  This
      may lead to confusion and\n   unnecessary complexity.  In order to address this
      situation, three\n   new textual conventions are defined in the Q-BRIDGE-MIB,
      called\n   VlanIdOrAny, VlanIdOrNone, and VlanIdOrAnyOrNone.  These new textual\n
      \  conventions should be (re)used in MIB modules so that they all\n   represent
      a VLAN-ID in the same way.\n   These textual conventions provide a means to
      specify MIB objects that\n   refer to a specific VLAN, to any VLAN, or to no
      VLAN.  For an example\n   of how these textual conventions might be used, consider
      a MIB\n   object, with SYNTAX of VlanIdOrAnyOrNone, that specifies the VLAN
      on\n   which to accept incoming packets of a particular protocol.  Such an\n
      \  object would allow the device to be configured to accept packets of\n   this
      protocol received with a specific 802.1q tag value, with any\n   802.1q tag
      value, or with no 802.1q tag.  Note that a MIB object that\n   is defined using
      one of these textual conventions should clarify the\n   meaning of 'any VLAN'
      and/or 'no VLAN' in its DESCRIPTION clause.\n"

      - "3.4.2.  Relationship to the IF-MIB\n   The IF-MIB, [RFC2863], requires that
        any MIB that is an adjunct of\n   the IF-MIB clarify specific areas within
        the IF-MIB.  These areas\n   were intentionally left vague in the IF-MIB in
        order to avoid over-\n   constraining the MIB, thereby precluding management
        of certain\n   media-types.\n   The IF-MIB enumerates several areas that a
        media-specific MIB must\n   clarify.  Each of these areas is addressed in
        a following subsection.\n   The implementor is referred to the IF-MIB in order
        to understand the\n   general intent of these areas.\n   The IF-MIB [RFC2863]
        defines managed objects for managing network\n   interfaces.  A network interface
        is considered attached to a\n   'subnetwork'.  (Note that this term is not
        to be confused with\n   'subnet', which refers to an addressing partitioning
        scheme used in\n   the Internet suite of protocols.)  The term 'segment' is
        used in this\n   memo to refer to such a subnetwork, whether it be an Ethernet\n
        \  segment, a 'ring', a WAN link, or even an X.25 virtual circuit.\n   Full
        support for the 802.1D management objects requires that the\n   IF-MIB objects
        ifIndex, ifType, ifDescr, ifPhysAddress, and\n   ifLastChange are implemented.
        \ Note that compliance to the current\n   IF-MIB module requires additional
        objects and notifications to be\n   implemented as specified in RFC 2863 [RFC2863].\n
        \  Implicit in this Extended Bridge MIB is the notion of ports on a\n   bridge.
        \ Each of these ports is associated with one interface of the\n   'interfaces'
        subtree (one row in ifTable), and, in most situations,\n   each port is associated
        with a different interface.  However, there\n   are situations in which multiple
        ports are associated with the same\n   interface.  An example of such a situation
        would be several ports\n   each corresponding one-to-one with several X.25
        virtual circuits but\n   all on the same interface.\n   Each port is uniquely
        identified by a port number.  A port number has\n   no mandatory relationship
        to an interface number, but in the simple\n   case a port number will have
        the same value as the corresponding\n   interface's interface number.  Port
        numbers are in the range\n   (1..dot1dBaseNumPorts).\n   Some entities perform
        other functionality as well as bridging through\n   the sending and receiving
        of data on their interfaces.  In such\n   situations, only a subset of the
        data sent/received on an interface\n   is within the domain of the entity's
        bridging functionality.  This\n   subset is considered delineated according
        to a set of protocols, with\n   some protocols being bridged, and other protocols
        not being bridged.\n   For example, in an entity that exclusively performed
        bridging, all\n   protocols would be considered bridged, whereas in an entity
        that\n   performed IP routing on IP datagrams and only bridged other\n   protocols,
        only the non-IP data would be considered bridged.\n   Thus, this Extended
        Bridge MIB (and in particular, its counters) is\n   applicable only to that
        subset of the data on an entity's interfaces\n   that is sent/received for
        a protocol being bridged.  All such data is\n   sent/received via the ports
        of the bridge.\n"

          Interfaces Subtree to be\n   in accordance with the IF-MIB [RFC2863], which
          states that the\n   interfaces table (ifTable) contains information on the
          managed\n   resource's interfaces and that each sub-layer below the internetwork\n
          \  layer of a network interface is considered an interface.\n   This document
          does not make any assumption that within an entity,\n   VLANs that are instantiated
          as an entry in dot1qVlanCurrentTable by\n   either management configuration
          through dot1qVlanStaticTable or by\n   dynamic means (e.g., through GVRP)
          are also represented by an entry\n   in ifTable.\n   Where an entity contains
          higher-layer protocol entities (e.g.,\n   IP-layer interfaces that transmit
          and receive traffic to/from a\n   VLAN), these should be represented in
          the ifTable as interfaces of\n   type propVirtual(53).  Protocol-specific
          types such as l3ipxvlan(137)\n   should not be used here, since there is
          no implication that the\n   bridge will perform any protocol filtering before
          delivering up to\n   these virtual interfaces.\n"

          use this table to\n   describe the binding of (for example) IP interfaces
          to physical\n   ports, although the presence of VLANs makes the representation
          less\n   than perfect for showing connectivity.  The ifStackTable cannot\n
          \  represent the full capability of the IEEE 802.1Q VLAN bridging\n   standard,
          since that makes a distinction between VLAN bindings on\n   'ingress' to

          whereas Interface MIB Evolution assumes a\n   symmetrical binding for transmit

  title: 5.  Definitions for Virtual Bridge MIB

  - "6.  Acknowledgements\n   Much of the groundwork for this document was performed
    by the IEEE\n   802.1 working group during the definition of the IEEE 802.1D updates\n
    \  [802.1D] and IEEE 802.1Q [802.1Q].\n   The authors wish to thank the members
    of the Bridge Working Group,\n   and David Harrington, Anders SW Christensen,
    Andrew Smith, Paul\n   Langille, Anil Rijhsinghani, and Keith McCloghrie in particular
    for\n   their comments and suggestions, which improved this effort.\n   Editing
    for the final version was done by David Levi.\n   The new textual conventions
    related to VLAN-IDs were produced as a\n   result of a review of the use of VLAN-ID
    in several MIB modules.\n   Further investigation found that VLAN-ID objects were
    defined in a\n   few other MIB modules.  The editor would like to thank all who\n
    \  contributed to the discussion that resulted in these new textual\n   conventions.
    \ Specifically, Bert Wijnen, Les Bell, Andrew Smith, Mike\n   Heard, Randy Presuhn,
    Dan Romascanu, Eduardo Cardona, Tom Petch,\n   Juergen Schoenwaelder, Richard
    Woundy, Tony Jeffree, and William\n   Murwin.  We also received input and feedback
    from IEEE confirming\n   that the values 0 and 4095 are not used for identifying
    a specific\n   VLAN-ID and so can be used to represent none or a wildcard (see\n
    \  Appendix A).\n"

  - "7.  Security Considerations\n   There are a number of management objects defined
    in this MIB module\n   with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.
    \ Such\n   objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network\n
    \  environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure\n   environment
    without proper protection can have a negative effect on\n   network operations.
    \ These tables and objects and their\n   sensitivity/vulnerability are described
    below.\n   The following tables and objects in the P-BRIDGE-MIB can be\n   manipulated
    to interfere with the operation of priority classes.\n   This could, for example,
    be used to force a reinitialization of state\n   machines, thus causing network
    instability.  Another possibility\n   would be for an attacker to override established
    policy on port\n   priorities, thus giving a user (or an attacker) unauthorized\n
    \  preferential treatment.\n         dot1dTrafficClassesEnabled\n         dot1dGmrpStatus\n
    \        dot1dPortPriorityTable\n         dot1dUserPriorityRegenTable\n         dot1dTrafficClassTable\n
    \        dot1dPortGarpTable\n         dot1dPortGmrpTable\n   The following tables
    and objects in the Q-BRIDGE-MIB could be\n   manipulated to interfere with the
    operation of virtual LANs.  This\n   could, for example, be used to force a reinitialization
    of state\n   machines to cause network instability, or changing the forwarding
    and\n   filtering policies.\n         dot1qGvrpStatus\n         dot1qForwardAllTable\n
    \        dot1qStaticUnicastTable\n         dot1qStaticMulticastTable\n         dot1qVlanStaticTable\n
    \        dot1qPortVlanTable\n         dot1qLearningConstraintsTable\n         dot1vProtocolGroupTable\n
    \        dot1vProtocolPortTable\n   Some of the readable objects in this MIB module
    (i.e., objects with a\n   MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered
    sensitive or\n   vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus important
    to\n   control even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly\n   to
    even encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over\n   the network
    via SNMP.  These are the tables and objects and their\n   sensitivity/vulnerability.\n
    \  The objects dot1dDeviceCapabilities and dot1dPortCapabilitiesTable in\n   the
    P-BRIDGE-MIB could be used by an attacker to determine which\n   attacks might
    be useful to attempt against a given device.\n   The following read-only tables
    and objects in the Q-BRIDGE-MIB could\n   be used by an attacker to determine
    which attacks might be useful to\n   attempt against a given device, could be
    used by an attacker to\n   detect whether their attacks are being blocked or filtered,
    or could\n   be used to understand the logical topology of the network.\n         dot1qMaxVlanID\n
    \        dot1qMaxSupportedVlans\n         dot1qNumVlans\n         dot1qFdbTable\n
    \        dot1qTpFdbTable\n         dot1qTpGroupTable\n         dot1qVlanCurrentTable\n
    \        dot1qPortVlanStatisticsTable\n   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not
    include adequate security.\n   Even if the network itself is secure (for example
    by using IPSec),\n   even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network
    is\n   allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects\n
    \  in this MIB module.\n   It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security
    features as\n   provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8),\n
    \  including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for\n   authentication
    and privacy).\n   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT\n
    \  RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to\n   enable
    cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator\n   responsibility to
    ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an\n   instance of this MIB module
    is properly configured to give access to\n   the objects only to those principals
    (users) that have legitimate\n   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete)
    them.\n"

    RE: VLAn ID\n   Bert et al -\n   We have concluded that the use of 4095 as a wildcard
    is acceptable\n   to 802.1, and we will make any necessary changes to 802.1Q in
    due\n   course to relax the current stated restriction.  However, we need\n   to
    know whether that is all that needs to be done to 802.1Q - i.e.,\n   is there
    any need to change our definitions of the managed objects\n   in the document
    (Clause 12) to reflect the interpretation of 4095\n   as a wildcard, or is this
    simply an issue for the SNMP machinery\n   to handle?\n   Regards,\n   Tony\n"
