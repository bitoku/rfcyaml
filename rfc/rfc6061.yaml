- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   The National Emergency Number Association (NENA) is currently\
    \ in the\n   process of setting standards, processes, and procedures for the use\n\
    \   of an IP-based Emergency Services IP Network (ESInet) for all public\n   safety\
    \ entities in North America.  Some of the solutions being\n   developed by NENA\
    \ require XML namespaces that are managed so that\n   they are unique and persistent.\
    \  To assure that the uniqueness is\n   absolute, the registration of a specific\
    \ Uniform Resource Name (URN)\n   [RFC2141] Namespace ID (NID) for use by NENA\
    \ is required.  This\n   document defines and registers such a namespace in accordance\
    \ with\n   [RFC3406].\n"

    \ information:\n      registration version number: 1\n      registration date:\
    \ 2010-10-13\n   Declared registrant of the namespace:\n      Registering organization\n\
    \         Name:       National Emergency Number Association (NENA)\n         Address:\

    \ 22203-1695\n   Designated contact:\n      Role:    NENA Registry Services Administrator\n\
    \      Email:   nrs-admin@nena.org\n   Declaration of syntactic structure:\n \
    \     The Namespace Specific String (NSS) of all URNs that use the\n      \"nena\"\
    \ NID will have the following structure:\n         {NENAclass}:{ClassSpecificString}\n\
    \   The \"NENAclass\" conforms to the URN syntax requirements [RFC2141] and\n\
    \   defines a specific class of resource type.  Each class will have a\n   specific\
    \ labeling scheme that is covered by \"ClassSpecificString\",\n   which also conforms\
    \ to the naming requirements of [RFC2141].\n   NENA maintains a naming authority,\
    \ the National Emergency Number\n   Association (NENA) Registry System (NRS),\
    \ that will manage the\n   assignment of \"NENAclass\" and the specific registration\
    \ values\n   assigned for each class.  Other NENA standards documents will define\n\
    \   the \"ClassSpecificStrings\" for a given \"NENAclass\".\n   Relevant ancillary\
    \ documentation:\n      The National Emergency Number Association Registry System\
    \ (NRS)\n      provides information on the registered resources and the\n    \
    \  registrations for each.  More information about the NRS and the\n      registration\
    \ activities and procedures to be followed are defined\n      in \"NENA Registry\
    \ System Standard\", NENA 70-001 [NENA70-001],\n      which is available at http://www.nena.org/.\n\
    \   Identifier uniqueness considerations:\n      The NRS will manage resources\
    \ using the \"nena\" NID and will be the\n      authority for managing the resources\
    \ and subsequent strings\n      associated.  The NRS shall ensure the uniqueness\
    \ of all nena URNs\n      by checking such names against the list of existing\
    \ namespace\n      names, as documented in NENA 70-001 [NENA70-001].\n   Identifier\
    \ persistence considerations:\n      The NRS will provide clear documentation\
    \ of the registered uses of\n      the \"nena\" NID.  The NRS will establish a\
    \ registry for\n      \"NENAclass\", as defined in NENA08-003 [NENA08-003].  Each\n\
    \      \"NENAclass\" will have a separate description in the registry and\n  \
    \    may have its own sub-registry.  In particular, new \"NENAclass\"\n      registry\
    \ entries will require a full NENA Technical Standard\n      document.\n   The\
    \ NRS will maintain a website at a stable address that provides XML\n   and text\
    \ renderings of the urn:nena registry.\n   Process of identifier assignment:\n\
    \      The NRS processes and procedures for identifier assignment are\n      documented\
    \ in NENA 07-001 [NENA70-001].  The registry that will\n      control the urn:nena\
    \ namespace is defined in NENA 08-003\n      [NENA08-003].  In particular, assignments\
    \ to the \"NENAclass\"\n      registry will require a NENA Technical Standard\
    \ document.\n      Subregistries for particular \"NENAclasses\" may be established\
    \ by\n      such technical standards.  Subregistries may be defined to have\n\
    \      more liberal management policies as defined in NENA 70-001\n      [NENA70-001],\
    \ but must be NRS managed and will not be permitted to\n      be delegated to\
    \ any other organization or registry.  Thus, the NRS\n      will manage the entire\
    \ urn:nena tree.\n   Process for identifier resolution:\n      The namespace is\
    \ not currently listed with a Resolution Discovery\n      System (RDS), but nothing\
    \ about the namespace prohibits the future\n      definition of appropriate resolution\
    \ methods or listing with\n      an RDS.\n   Rules for lexical equivalence:\n\
    \      No special considerations; the rules for lexical equivalence of\n     \
    \ [RFC2141] apply.\n   Conformance with URN syntax:\n      No special considerations.\n\
    \   Validation mechanism:\n      None specified.  URN assignment will be handled\
    \ by procedures\n      implemented in support of NENA activities.\n   Scope:\n\
    \      Global\n"

- title: 4.  Namespace Considerations
  contents:
  - "4.  Namespace Considerations\n   The National Emergency Number Association has\
    \ developed standards for\n   emergency calling in North America for several decades.\
    \  NENA is\n   developing a variety of applications and services using Internet\n\
    \   protocols built upon IETF standards.  Some of these services require\n   that\
    \ supporting information (e.g., data descriptions, attributes,\n   etc.) be fully\
    \ specified.  For proper operation, descriptions of the\n   needed supporting\
    \ information must exist and be available in a\n   unique, reliable, and persistent\
    \ manner.  These dependencies provide\n   the basis of the need for namespaces,\
    \ in one form or another, and\n   will enable NENA to define URNs that are to\
    \ assign cleaner, more\n   general, more permanent, more reliable, and more controllable\n\
    \   namespace names related to NENA standards, while keeping URNs defined\n  \
    \ by NENA properly separate from the IETF-defined URNs.\n   As the National Emergency\
    \ Number Association work is ongoing and\n   covers many technical areas, the\
    \ possibility of binding to various\n   other namespace repositories has been\
    \ deemed impractical.  Each\n   object or description, as defined in NENA, could\
    \ possibly be related\n   to multiple different namespaces, so further conflicts\
    \ of association\n   could occur.  Thus, the intent is to utilize the National\
    \ Emergency\n   Number Association Registry System, operated by NENA, as the naming\n\
    \   authority for NENA-defined objects and descriptions.\n"
- title: 5.  Community Considerations
  contents:
  - "5.  Community Considerations\n   The North American public safety organizations\
    \ will benefit from\n   publication of this namespace by having permanent and\
    \ reliable URNs\n   to be used with protocols defined by NENA.  The objects and\n\
    \   descriptions required for services defined by NENA are generally\n   available\
    \ for use by other organizations.  The National Emergency\n   Number Association\
    \ will provide access and support for name requests\n   by these organizations\
    \ within the constraints of the defined NRS\n   processes and the specific urn:nena\
    \ registry and subregistries.  This\n   support can be enabled in a timely and\
    \ responsive fashion as new\n   objects and descriptions are produced.  These\
    \ will be enabled in a\n   fashion similar to current IANA processes, as documented\
    \ in\n   NENA70-001 [NENA70-001].\n   The NRS establishes registries when called\
    \ for in a NENA Technical\n   Standard.  Such standards must provide the NRS with\
    \ clear and concise\n   instructions on creating and maintaining such registries.\
    \  Defined\n   management policies include \"NENA Technical Standard Required\"\
    , \"NENA\n   Document Required\", \"Expert Review\", and \"First Come First Served\"\
    ,\n   which correspond to similar IANA management policies.  NENA is\n   establishing\
    \ a website that provides controlled entry of new\n   registries and entries in\
    \ registries, and automatically produces HTML\n   and XML descriptions of registry\
    \ contents that are used by vendors\n   and other consumers of the content.\n"

  - "7.  IANA Considerations\n   This document adds a new entry in the URN Namespaces\
