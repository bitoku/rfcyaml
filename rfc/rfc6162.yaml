  - "1.  Introduction\n   [RFC5959] describes conventions necessary to protect the\n
    \  AsymmetricKeyPackage content type [RFC5958] with Cryptographic\n   Message
    Syntax (CMS) protecting the following content types:\n   SignedData [RFC5652],
    EnvelopedData [RFC5652], EncryptedData\n   [RFC5652], AuthenticatedData [RFC5652],
    and AuthEnvelopedData\n   [RFC5083].  This document amends [RFC5959] by extending
    the\n   algorithms used with SignedData and EnvelopedData to include Elliptic\n
    \  Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) and Elliptic Curve Diffie-\n   Hellman
    (ECDH), respectively.  Familiarity with [RFC5959] and\n   [RFC5753] is assumed.\n
    \  This document does not define any new algorithms; instead, it refers\n   to
    previously defined algorithms.\n"

- contents:
  - "2.  AsymmetricKeyPackage\n   As noted in Asymmetric Key Packages [RFC5958], CMS
    can be used to\n   protect the AsymmetricKeyPackage.  The following provides guidance\n
    \  for SignedData [RFC5652] and EnvelopedData [RFC5652] when used with\n   Elliptic
    Curve algorithms.\n"
  - contents:
    - "2.1.  SignedData\n   If an implementation supports SignedData, then it MAY
      support ECDSA\n   [RFC6090][RFC5753].\n"

  - contents:
    - "2.2.  EnvelopedData\n   When key agreement is used, standard (as opposed to
      cofactor) ECDH\n   [RFC6090][RFC5753] MAY be supported.\n"
    title: 2.2.  EnvelopedData
  title: 2.  AsymmetricKeyPackage
- contents:
  - "3.  Public Key Sizes\n   The easiest way to implement SignedData and EnvelopedData
    is with\n   public key certificates [RFC5280][RFC5480].  If an implementation\n
    \  supports ECDSA or ECDH, then it MUST support keys on the P-256 curve.\n"
