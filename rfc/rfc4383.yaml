  - "1.  Introduction\n   Multicast and broadcast communications introduce some new\
    \ security\n   challenges compared to unicast communication.  Many multicast and\n\
    \   broadcast applications need \"data origin authentication\" (DOA), or\n   \"\
    source authentication\", in order to guarantee that a received\n   message had\
    \ originated from a given source, and was not manipulated\n   during the transmission.\
    \  In unicast communication, a pairwise\n   security association between one sender\
    \ and one receiver can provide\n   data origin authentication using symmetric-key\
    \ cryptography (such as\n   a message authentication code, MAC).  When the communication\
    \ is\n   strictly pairwise, the sender and receiver agree upon a key that is\n\
    \   known only to them.\n   In groups, however, a key is shared among more than\
    \ two members, and\n   this symmetric-key approach does not guarantee data origin\n\
    \   authentication.  When there is a group security association [RFC4046]\n  \
    \ instead of a pairwise security association, any of the members can\n   alter\
    \ the packet and impersonate any other member.  The MAC in this\n   case only\
    \ guarantees that the packet was not manipulated by an\n   attacker outside the\
    \ group (and hence not in possession of the group\n   key), and that the packet\
    \ was sent by a source within the group.\n   Some applications cannot tolerate\
    \ source ambiguity and need to\n   identify the true sender from any other group\
    \ member.  A common way\n   to solve the problem is by use of asymmetric cryptography,\
    \ such as\n   digital signatures.  This method, unfortunately, suffers from high\n\
    \   overhead in terms of time (to sign and verify) and bandwidth (to\n   convey\
    \ the signature in the packet).\n   Several schemes have been proposed to provide\
    \ efficient data origin\n   authentication in multicast and broadcast scenarios.\
    \  The Timed\n   Efficient Stream Loss-tolerant Authentication (TESLA) is one\
    \ such\n   scheme.\n   This memo specifies TESLA authentication for SRTP.  SRTP\
    \ TESLA can\n   provide data origin authentication to RTP applications that use\
    \ group\n   security associations (such as multicast RTP applications) so long\
    \ as\n   receivers abide by the TESLA security invariants [RFC4082].\n"
- title: 1.1.  Notational Conventions
  contents:
  - "1.1.  Notational Conventions\n   The keywords \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\"\
    , \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"\
    MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n   document are to be interpreted as described\
    \ in [RFC2119].\n   This specification assumes that the reader is familiar with\
    \ both SRTP\n   and TESLA.  Few of their details are explained in this document,\
    \ and\n   the reader can find them in their respective specifications,\n   [RFC3711]\
    \ and [RFC4082].  This specification uses the same\n   definitions as TESLA for\
    \ common terms and assumes that the reader is\n   familiar with the TESLA algorithms\
    \ and protocols [RFC4082].\n"
- title: 2.  SRTP
  contents:
  - "2.  SRTP\n   The Secure Real-time Transport Protocol (SRTP) [RFC3711] is a profile\n\
    \   of RTP, which can provide confidentiality, message authentication,\n   and\
    \ replay protection to the RTP traffic and to the RTP control\n   protocol, the\
    \ Real-time Transport Control Protocol (RTCP).  Note that\n   the term \"SRTP\"\
    \ may often be used to indicate SRTCP as well.\n   SRTP is a framework that allows\
    \ new security functions and new\n   transforms to be added.  SRTP currently does\
    \ not define any mechanism\n   to provide data origin authentication for group\
    \ security\n   associations.  Fortunately, it is straightforward to add TESLA\
    \ to the\n   SRTP cryptographic framework.\n   The TESLA extension to SRTP is\
    \ defined in this specification, which\n   assumes that the reader is familiar\
    \ with the SRTP specification\n   [RFC3711], its packet structure, and its processing\
    \ rules.  TESLA is\n   an alternative message-authentication algorithm that authenticates\n\
    \   messages from the source when a key is shared among two or more\n   receivers.\n"
- title: 3.  TESLA
  contents:
  - "3.  TESLA\n   TESLA provides delayed per-packet data authentication and is\n\
    \   specified in [RFC4082].\n   In addition to its SRTP data-packet definition\
    \ given here, TESLA\n   needs an initial synchronization protocol and initial\
    \ bootstrapping\n   procedure.  The synchronization protocol allows the sender\
    \ and the\n   receiver to compare their clocks and determine an upper bound of\
    \ the\n   difference.  The synchronization protocol is outside the scope of\n\
    \   this document.\n   TESLA also requires an initial bootstrapping procedure\
    \ to exchange\n   needed parameters and the initial commitment to the key chain\n\
    \   [RFC4082].  For SRTP, it is assumed that the bootstrapping is\n   performed\
    \ out-of-band, possibly using the key management protocol\n   that is exchanging\
    \ the security parameters for SRTP, e.g., [RFC3547,\n   RFC3830].  Initial bootstrapping\
    \ of TESLA is outside the scope of\n   this document.\n"

    \ to the SRTP specification\n   [RFC3711] and describes the use of TESLA with\

    \   The \"Authenticated Portion\" of an SRTP packet consists of the RTP\n   header,\

    \ field but does not\n   include the MKI.  It is necessary for packet integrity\
    \ that the\n   SRTP-TESLA MAC tag be covered by the SRTP integrity check.  SRTP\
    \ does\n   not cover the MKI field (because it does not need to be covered for\n\

    \ to include the MKI in SRTP-MAC coverage.  This change\n   is impossible, so\
    \ the MKI field separates the TESLA MAC from the SRTP\n   MAC in the packet layout\
    \ of Figure 2.  This change to the packet\n   format presents no problem to an\
    \ implementation that supports the new\n   SRTP-TESLA authentication transform.\n\
    \   The lengths of the Disclosed Key and TESLA MAC fields are Section 4.3\n  \

  contents:
  - "4.4.2.  Receiver Processing\n   The receiver processing is as described in Section\
    \ 3.3 of [RFC3711],\n   up to step 4, inclusive.\n   To authenticate and replay-protect\
    \ the current packet, the processing\n   is as follows:\n      First, check if\
    \ the packet has been replayed (as per Section 3.3\n      of [RFC3711]).  Note,\
    \ however, that the SRTP replay list contains\n      SRTP indices of recently\
    \ received packets that have been\n      authenticated by TESLA (i.e., replay\
    \ list updates MUST NOT be\n      based on SRTP MAC).  If the packet is judged\
    \ to be replayed, then\n      the packet MUST be discarded, and the event SHOULD\
    \ be logged.\n      Next, perform verification of the SRTP integrity protection\
    \ tag\n      (not the TESLA MAC), if present, using the rollover counter from\n\
    \      the current packet, the authentication algorithm indicated in the\n   \
    \   cryptographic context, and the session authentication key.  If the\n     \
    \ verification is unsuccessful, the packet MUST be discarded from\n      further\
    \ processing, and the event SHOULD be logged.\n      If the verification is successful,\
    \ remove and store the MKI (if\n      present) and authentication tag fields from\
    \ the packet.  The\n      packet is buffered, awaiting disclosure of the TESLA\
    \ key in a\n      subsequent packet.\n      TESLA authentication is performed\
    \ on a packet when the key is\n      disclosed in a subsequent packet.  Recall\
    \ that a key for interval\n      i is disclosed during interval i+d, i.e., the\
    \ same key is\n      disclosed in packets sent over d intervals of length t_int.\
    \  If\n      the interval identifier i from the packet (Section 4.1) has\n   \
    \   advanced more than d intervals from the highest value of i that\n      has\
    \ been received, then packets have been lost, and one or more\n      keys MUST\
    \ be computed as described in Section 3.2, second\n      paragraph, of the TESLA\
    \ specification [RFC4082].  The computation\n      is performed recursively for\
    \ all disclosed keys that have been\n      lost, from the newly-received interval\
    \ to the last-received\n      interval.\n      When a newly-disclosed key is received\
    \ or computed, perform the\n      TESLA verification of the packet using the rollover\
    \ counter from\n      the packet, the TESLA security parameters from the cryptographic\n\
    \      context, and the disclosed key.  If the verification is\n      unsuccessful,\
    \ the packet MUST be discarded from further\n      processing, and the event SHOULD\
    \ be logged.  If the TESLA\n      verification is successful, remove the TESLA\
    \ authentication\n      extension from the packet.\n   To decrypt the current\
    \ packet, the processing is as follows:\n      Decrypt the Encrypted Portion of\
    \ the packet, using the decryption\n      algorithm indicated in the cryptographic\
    \ context, the session\n      encryption key, and salt (if used) found in Step\
    \ 4 with the index\n      from Step 2.\n   (Note that the order of decryption\
    \ and TESLA verification is not\n   mandated.  It is RECOMMENDED that the TESLA\
    \ verification be performed\n   before decryption.  TESLA application designers\
    \ might choose to\n   implement optimistic processing techniques such as notification\
    \ of\n   TESLA verification results after decryption or even after plaintext\n\
    \   processing.  Optimistic verification is beyond the scope of this\n   document.)\n\
    \   Update the rollover counter and highest sequence number, s_l, in the\n   cryptographic\
    \ context, using the packet index estimated in Step 2.\n   If replay protection\
    \ is provided, also update the Replay List (i.e.,\n   the Replay List is updated\
    \ after the TESLA authentication is\n   successfully verified).\n"

    \ of this document.\n   Furthermore, TESLA MUST be bootstrapped at session setup\
    \ (for the\n   parameter exchange and the initial key commitment) through a regular\n\
    \   data authentication system (a digital signature algorithm is\n   RECOMMENDED).\
    \  Key management procedures can take care of this\n   bootstrapping prior to\
    \ the commencement of an SRTP session where\n   TESLA authentication is used.\
    \  The bootstrapping mechanism is out of\n   scope for this document (it could,\
    \ for example, be part of the key\n   management protocol).\n   A critical factor\
    \ for the security of TESLA is that the sender and\n   receiver need to be loosely\
    \ synchronized.  TESLA requires a bound on\n   clock drift to be known (D_t).\
    \  Use of TESLA in SRTP assumes that the\n   time synchronization is guaranteed\
    \ by out-of-band schemes (e.g., key\n   management).  That is, it is not in the\
    \ scope of SRTP.\n   It also should be noted that TESLA has some reliability requirements\n\
    \   in that a key is disclosed for a packet in a subsequent packet, which\n  \
    \ can get lost.  Since a key in a lost packet can be derived from a\n   future\
    \ packet, TESLA is robust to packet loss.  This key stream\n   stops, however,\
    \ when the key-bearing data stream packets stop at the\n   conclusion of the RTP\
    \ session.  To avoid this nasty boundary\n   condition, send null packets with\
    \ TESLA keys for one entire key-\n   disclosure period following the interval\
    \ in which the stream ceases:\n   Null packets SHOULD be sent for d intervals\
    \ of duration t_int (items\n   8 and 9 of Section 4.3).  The rate of null packets\
    \ SHOULD be the\n   average rate of the session media stream.\n"

    \ as\n   protection against external DoS.\n   The default values for the security\
    \ parameters are listed in the\n   following table.\n   Parameter            \

    \ for the TESLA MAC and the TESLA PRF.  The TESLA keychain\n   generator is recursively\
    \ defined as follows [RFC4082].\n                    K_i=HMAC_SHA1(K_{i+1},0),\
    \ i=0..N-1\n   where N-1=n_c from the cryptographic context.\n   The TESLA MAC\
    \ key generator is defined as follows [RFC4082].\n                           K'_i=HMAC_SHA1(K_i,1)\n\
    \   The TESLA MAC uses a truncated output of ten bytes [RFC2104] and is\n   defined\
    \ as follows.\n                            HMAC_SHA1(K'_i, M')\n   where M' is\

  - "7.  Security Considerations\n   Denial of Service (DoS) attacks on delayed authentication\
    \ are\n   discussed in [PCST].  TESLA requires receiver buffering before\n   authentication;\
    \ therefore, the receiver can suffer a denial of\n   service attack due to a flood\
    \ of bogus packets.  To address this\n   problem, the external SRTP MAC, based\
    \ on the group key, MAY be used\n   in addition to the TESLA MAC.  The short size\
    \ of the SRTP MAC\n   (default 32 bits) is motivated because that MAC is purely\
    \ for DoS\n   prevention from attackers external to the group.  The shorter output\n\
    \   tag means that an attacker has a better chance of getting a forged\n   packet\
    \ accepted, which is about 2^31 attempts on average.  As a first\n   line of defense\
    \ against a denial of service attack, a short tag is\n   probably adequate; a\
    \ victim will likely have ample evidence that it\n   is under attack before accepting\
    \ a forged packet, which will\n   subsequently fail the TESLA check.  [RFC4082]\
    \ describes other\n   mechanisms that can be used to prevent DoS, in place of\
    \ the external\n   group-key MAC.  If used, they need to be added as processing\
    \ steps\n   (following the guidelines of [RFC4082]).\n   The use of TESLA in SRTP\
    \ defined in this specification is subject to\n   the security considerations\
    \ discussed in the SRTP specification\n   [RFC3711] and in the TESLA specification\
    \ [RFC4082].  In particular,\n   the TESLA security is dependent on the computation\
    \ of the \"safety\n   condition\" as defined in Section 3.5 of [RFC4082].\n  \
    \ SRTP TESLA depends on the effective security of the systems that\n   perform\
    \ bootstrapping (time synchronization) and key management.\n   These systems are\
    \ external to SRTP and are not considered in this\n   specification.\n   The length\
    \ of the TESLA MAC is by default 80 bits.  RFC 2104 requires\n   the MAC length\
    \ to be at least 80 bits and at least half the output\n   size of the underlying\
    \ hash function.  The SHA-1 output size is 160\n   bits, so both of these requirements\
    \ are met with the 80-bit MAC\n   specified in this document.  Note that IPsec\
    \ implementations tend to\n   use 96 bits for their MAC values to align the header\
    \ with a 64-bit\n   boundary.  Both MAC sizes are well beyond the reach of current\n\
    \   cryptanalytic techniques.\n"
