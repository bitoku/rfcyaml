  contents:
  - "1. Basic Responsibilities\n   The Internet is a co-operative endeavor, and its\
    \ usefulness depends\n   on reasonable behaviour from every user, host and router\
    \ in the\n   Internet.  It follows that people in charge of the components of\
    \ the\n   Internet MUST be aware of their responsibilities and attentive to\n\
    \   local conditions.  Furthermore, they MUST be accessible via both\n   Internet\
    \ mail and telephone, and responsive to problem reports and\n   diagnostic initiatives\
    \ from other participants.\n   Even local problems as simple and transient as\
    \ system crashes or\n   power failures may have widespread effects elsewhere in\
    \ the net.\n   Problems which require co-operation between two or more responsible\n\
    \   individuals to diagnose and correct are relatively common.  Likewise,\n  \
    \ the tools, access and experience needed for efficient analysis may\n   not all\
    \ exist at a single site.\n   This communal approach to Internet management and\
    \ maintenance is\n   dictated by the present decentralized organizational structure.\
    \  The\n   structure, in turn, exists because it is inexpensive and responsive\n\
    \   to diverse local needs.  Furthermore, for the near term, it is our\n   only\
    \ choice; I don't see any prospect of either the government or\n   private enterprise\
    \ building a monolithic, centralized, ubiquitous \"Ma\n   Datagram\" network provider\
    \ in this century.\n"
- title: 2. Responsibilities of Network Managers
  contents:
  - "2. Responsibilities of Network Managers\n   One or more individuals are responsible\
    \ for every IP net or subnet\n   which is connected to the Internet.  Their names,\
    \ phone numbers and\n   postal addresses MUST be supplied to the Internet NIC\
    \ (or to the\n   local or regional transit network's NIC) prior to the network's\n\
    \   initial connection to the Internet, and updates and corrections MUST\n   be\
    \ provided in a timely manner for as long as the net remains\n   connected.\n\
    \   In order to adequately deal with problems that may arise, a network\n   manager\
    \ must have either:\n      A. System management access privileges on every host\
    \ and router\n         connected to the local network, or:\n      B. The authority\
    \ and access to either power off, re-boot,\n         physically disconnect or\
    \ disable forwarding IP datagrams from\n         any individual host system that\
    \ may be misbehaving.\n   For all networks, a network manager capable of exercising\
    \ this level\n   of control MUST be accessible via telephone 8 hours a day, 5\
    \ days a\n   week.  For nets carrying transit traffic, a network manager SHOULD\
    \ be\n   accessible via telephone 24 hours a day.\n"
- title: 3. Responsibilities of Host System Managers

  - "3. Responsibilities of Host System Managers\n   One or more individuals must\
    \ be responsible for every host connected\n   to the Internet.  This person MUST\
    \ have the authority, access and\n   tools necessary to configure, operate and\
    \ control access to the\n   system.  For important timesharing hosts, primary\
    \ domain name servers\n   and mail relays or gateways, responsible individual(s)\
    \ SHOULD be\n   accessible via telephone 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.\n   For\
    \ less-important timesharing hosts or single-user PCs or\n   workstations, the\
    \ responsible individual(s) MUST be prepared for the\n   possiblity that their\
    \ network manager may have to intervene in their\n   absence, should the resolution\
    \ of an Internet problem require it.\n"
- title: 4. Postmaster@foo.bar.baz

  - "4. Postmaster@foo.bar.baz\n   Every Internet host that handles mail beyond the\
    \ local network MUST\n   maintain a mailbox named \"postmaster\".  In general,\
    \ this should not\n   simply forward mail elsewhere, but instead be read by a\
    \ system\n   maintainer logged in to the machine.  This mailbox SHOULD be read\
    \ at\n   least 5 days a week, and arrangements MUST be made to handle incoming\n\
    \   mail in the event of the absence of the normal maintainer.\n   A machine's\
    \ \"postmaster\" is the normal point of contact for problems\n   related to mail\
    \ delivery.  Because most traffic on the long-haul\n   segments of the Internet\
    \ is in the form of mail messages, a local\n   problem can have significant effects\
    \ elsewhere in the Internet.  Some\n   problems may be system-wide, such as disk\
    \ or file system full, or\n   mailer or domain name server hung, crashed or confused.\
    \  Others may\n   be specific to a particular user or mailing list (incorrect\
    \ aliasing\n   or forwarding, quota exceeded, etc.).\n   In either case, the maintainer\
    \ of a remote machine will normally send\n   mail about delivery problems to \"\
    postmaster\".  Also, \"postmaster\" is\n   normally specified in the \"reply-to:\"\
    \ field of automatically\n   generated mail error messages (unable to deliver\
    \ due to nonexistent\n   user name, unable to forward, malformed header, etc.).\
    \  If this\n   mailbox isn't read in a timely manner, significant quantities of\
    \ mail\n   may be lost or returned to its senders.\n"
- title: 5. Problems and Resolutions
  contents:
  - "5. Problems and Resolutions\n   Advances in network management tools may eventually\
    \ make it possible\n   for a network maintainer to detect and address most problems\
    \ before\n   they affect users, but for the present, day-to-day users of\n   networking\
    \ services represent the front line.  No responsible\n   individual should allow\
    \ their \"dumb-question\" filter to become too\n   restrictive; reports of the\
    \ form \"I haven't gotten any mumblefrotz\n   mail for a week... \" or \"I could\
    \ get there this morning, but not\n   now...\" should always get timely attention.\n\
    \   There are three basic classes of problems that may have network-wide\n   scope:\
    \  User-related, host-related and network-related.\n      A. User-related problems\
    \ can range from bouncing mail or\n         uncivilized behaviour on mailing lists\
    \ to more serious\n         issues like violation of privacy, break-in attempts\
    \ or\n         vandalism.\n      B. Host-related problems may include mis-configured\
    \ software,\n         obsolete or buggy software and security holes.\n      C.\
    \ Network-related problems are most frequently related to\n         routing: incorrect\
    \ connectivity advertisements, routing\n         loops and black holes can all\
    \ have major impacts.\n         Mechanisms are usually in place for handling failure\
    \ of\n         routers or links, but problems short of outright failure\n    \
    \     can also have severe effects.\n   Each class of problem has its own characteristics.\
    \  User-related\n   problems can usually be solved by education, but system managers\n\
    \   should be aware of applicable federal and state law as well; Privacy\n   violations\
    \ or \"cracking\" attempts have always been grounds for\n   pulling a user's account,\
    \ but now they can also result in\n   prosecution.  Host-related problems are\
    \ usually resolvable by re-\n   configuration or upgrading the software, but sometimes\
    \ the\n   manufacturer needs to be made aware of a bug, or jawboned into doing\n\
    \   something about it; Bugs that can't be fixed may be serious enough to\n  \
    \ require partial or total denial of service to the offending system.\n   Similar\
    \ levels of escalation exist for network-related problems, with\n   the solution\
    \ of last resort being ostracism of the offending net.\n"
- title: 6. The Illusion of Security
  contents:
  - "6. The Illusion of Security\n   Every host and network manager MUST be aware\
    \ that the Internet as\n   presently constituted is NOT secure.  At the protocol\
    \ level, much\n   more effort has been put into interoperability, reliability\
    \ and\n   convenience than has been devoted to security, although this is\n  \
    \ changing.  Recent events have made software developers and vendors\n   more\
    \ sensitive to security, in both configuration and the underlying\n   implementation,\
    \ but it remains to be demonstrated how much long-term\n   effect this will have.\
    \  Meanwhile, the existing system survives\n   through the co-operation of all\
    \ responsible individuals.\n   Security is subjective; one site might view as\
    \ idle curiosity what\n   another would see as a hostile probe.  Since ultimately\
    \ the existence\n   of the Internet depends on its usefulness to all members of\
    \ the\n   community, it is important for managers to be willing to accept and\n\
    \   act on other sites' security issues, warning or denying access to\n   offending\
    \ users.  The offended site, in turn, must be reasonable in\n   its demands (someone\
    \ who set off an alarm while idly seeing if the\n   sendmail \"DEBUG\" hole was\
    \ closed on a \"sensitive\" host probably\n   should be warned, rather than prosecuted).\n\
    \   Because Internet security issues may require that local management\n   people\
    \ either get in touch with any of their users, or deny an\n   offending individual\
    \ or group access to other sites, it is necessary\n   that mechanisms exist to\
    \ allow this.  Accordingly, Internet sites\n   SHOULD NOT have \"general use\"\
    \ accounts, or \"open\" (without password)\n   terminal servers that can access\
    \ the rest of the Internet.\n   In turn, the \"sensitive\" sites MUST be aware\
    \ that it is impossible in\n   the long term to deny Internet access to crackers,\
    \ disgruntled former\n   employees, unscrupulous competitors or agents of other\
    \ countries.\n   Getting an offender flushed is at best a stop-gap, providing\
    \ a\n   breathing space of a day or an hour while the security holes under\n \
    \  attack are closed.  It follows that each host's manager is ultimately\n   responsible\
    \ for its security; the more \"sensitive\" the application or\n   data, the more\
    \ intimate the manager must be with the host's operating\n   system and network\
    \ software and their foibles.\n"
