- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   Informational RFC 3164 [8] describes the syslog protocol\
    \ as it was\n   observed in existing implementations.  It describes both the format\n\
    \   of syslog messages and a UDP [1] transport.  Subsequently, a\n   Standards-Track\
    \ syslog protocol has been defined in RFC 5424 [2].\n   RFC 5424 specifies a layered\
    \ architecture that provides for support\n   of any number of transport layer\
    \ mappings for transmitting syslog\n   messages.  This document describes the\
    \ UDP transport mapping for the\n   syslog protocol.\n   The transport described\
    \ in this document can be used for transmitting\n   syslog messages over both\
    \ IPv4 [3] and IPv6 [4].\n   Network administrators and architects should be aware\
    \ of the\n   significant reliability and security issues of this transport, which\n\
    \   stem from the use of UDP.  They are documented in this specification.\n  \
    \ However, this transport is lightweight and is built upon the existing\n   popular\
    \ use of UDP for syslog.\n"

- title: 3.1.  One Message Per Datagram
  contents:
  - "3.1.  One Message Per Datagram\n   Each syslog UDP datagram MUST contain only\
    \ one syslog message, which\n   MAY be complete or truncated.  The message MUST\
    \ be formatted and\n   truncated according to RFC 5424 [2].  Additional data MUST\
    \ NOT be\n   present in the datagram payload.\n"
- title: 3.2.  Message Size
  contents:
  - "3.2.  Message Size\n   This transport mapping supports transmission of syslog\
    \ messages up to\n   65535 octets minus the UDP header length.  This limit stems\
    \ from the\n   maximum supported UDP size of 65535 octets specified in RFC 768\
    \ [1].\n   For IPv4, the maximum payload size is 65535 octets minus the UDP\n\
    \   header and minus the IP header because IPv4 has a 16-bit length field\n  \
    \ that also includes the header length.\n   IPv4 syslog receivers MUST be able\
    \ to receive datagrams with message\n   sizes up to and including 480 octets.\
    \  IPv6 syslog receivers MUST be\n   able to receive datagrams with message sizes\
    \ up to and including 1180\n   octets.  All syslog receivers SHOULD be able to\
    \ receive datagrams\n   with message sizes of up to and including 2048 octets.\
    \  The ability\n   to receive larger messages is encouraged.\n   The above restrictions\
    \ and recommendations establish a baseline for\n   interoperability.  The minimum\
    \ required message size support was\n   determined based on the minimum MTU size\
    \ that Internet hosts are\n   required to support: 576 octets for IPv4 [3] and\
    \ 1280 octets for IPv6\n   [4].  Datagrams that conform to these limits have the\
    \ greatest chance\n   of being delivered because they do not require fragmentation.\n\
    \   It is RECOMMENDED that syslog senders restrict message sizes such\n   that\
    \ IP datagrams do not exceed the smallest MTU of the network in\n   use.  This\
    \ avoids datagram fragmentation and possible issues\n   surrounding fragmentation\
    \ such as incorrect MTU discovery.\n   Fragmentation can be undesirable because\
    \ it increases the risk of the\n   message being lost due to loss of just one\
    \ datagram fragment.  Syslog\n   has no acknowledgement facility, and therefore\
    \ there is no effective\n   way to handle retransmission.  This makes it impossible\
    \ for syslog to\n   utilize packetization layer path MTU discovery [9].  When\
    \ network MTU\n   is not known in advance, the safest assumption is to restrict\n\
    \   messages to 480 octets for IPv4 and 1180 octets for IPv6.\n"
- title: 3.3.  Source and Target Ports
  contents:
  - "3.3.  Source and Target Ports\n   Syslog receivers MUST support accepting syslog\
    \ datagrams on the well-\n   known UDP port 514, but MAY be configurable to listen\
    \ on a different\n   port.  Syslog senders MUST support sending syslog message\
    \ datagrams\n   to the UDP port 514, but MAY be configurable to send messages\
    \ to a\n   different port.  Syslog senders MAY use any source UDP port for\n \
    \  transmitting messages.\n"
- title: 3.4.  Source IP Address
  contents:
  - "3.4.  Source IP Address\n   The source IP address of the UDP datagrams SHOULD\
    \ NOT be interpreted\n   as the identifier for the host that originated the syslog\
    \ message.\n   The entity sending the syslog message could be merely a relay.\
    \  The\n   syslog message itself contains the identifier of the originator of\n\
    \   the message.\n"
- title: 3.5.  UDP/IP Structure
  contents:
  - "3.5.  UDP/IP Structure\n   Each UDP/IP datagram sent by the transport layer MUST\
    \ completely\n   adhere to the structure specified in the UDP RFC 768 [1] and\
    \ either\n   the IPv4 RFC 791 [3] or IPv6 RFC 2460 [4], depending on which\n \
    \  protocol is used.\n"
- title: 3.6.  UDP Checksums
  contents:
  - "3.6.  UDP Checksums\n   Syslog senders MUST NOT disable UDP checksums.  IPv4\
    \ syslog senders\n   SHOULD use UDP checksums when sending messages.  Note that\
    \ RFC 2460\n   [4] mandates the use of UDP checksums when sending UDP datagrams\
    \ over\n   IPv6.\n   Syslog receivers MUST NOT disable UDP checksum checks.  IPv4\
    \ syslog\n   receivers SHOULD check UDP checksums and SHOULD accept a syslog\n\
    \   message with a zero checksum.  Note that RFC 2460 [4] mandates the\n   use\
    \ of checksums for UDP over IPv6.\n"
- title: 4.  Reliability Considerations
  contents:
  - "4.  Reliability Considerations\n   The UDP is an unreliable, low-overhead protocol.\
    \  This section\n   discusses reliability issues inherent in UDP that implementers\
    \ and\n   users should be aware of.\n"
- title: 4.1.  Lost Datagrams
  contents:
  - "4.1.  Lost Datagrams\n   This transport mapping does not provide any mechanism\
    \ to detect and\n   correct loss of datagrams.  Datagrams can be lost in transit\
    \ due to\n   congestion, corruption, or any other intermittent network problem.\n\
    \   IP fragmentation exacerbates this problem because loss of a single\n   fragment\
    \ will result in the entire message being discarded.\n"
- title: 4.2.  Message Corruption
  contents:
  - "4.2.  Message Corruption\n   The UDP/IP datagrams can get corrupted in transit\
    \ due to software,\n   hardware, or network errors.  This transport mapping specifies\
    \ use of\n   UDP checksums to enable corruption detection in addition to checksums\n\
    \   used in IP and Layer 2 protocols.  However, checksums do not\n   guarantee\
    \ corruption detection, and this transport mapping does not\n   provide for message\
    \ acknowledgement or retransmission mechanism.\n"
- title: 4.3.  Congestion Control
  contents:
  - "4.3.  Congestion Control\n   Because syslog can generate unlimited amounts of\
    \ data, transferring\n   this data over UDP is generally problematic, because\
    \ UDP lacks\n   congestion control mechanisms.  Congestion control mechanisms\
    \ that\n   respond to congestion by reducing traffic rates and establish a\n \
    \  degree of fairness between flows that share the same path are vital\n   to\
    \ the stable operation of the Internet [6].  This is why the syslog\n   TLS transport\
    \ [7] is REQUIRED to implement and RECOMMENDED for\n   general use.\n   The only\
    \ environments where the syslog UDP transport MAY be used as\n   an alternative\
    \ to the TLS transport are managed networks, where the\n   network path has been\
    \ explicitly provisioned for UDP syslog traffic\n   through traffic engineering\
    \ mechanisms, such as rate limiting or\n   capacity reservations.  In all other\
    \ environments, the TLS transport\n   [7] SHOULD be used.\n"
- title: 4.4.  Sequenced Delivery
  contents:
  - "4.4.  Sequenced Delivery\n   The IP transport used by the UDP does not guarantee\
    \ that the sequence\n   of datagram delivery will match the order in which the\
    \ datagrams were\n   sent.  The time stamp contained within each syslog message\
    \ can serve\n   as a rough guide in establishing sequence order.  However, it\
    \ will\n   not help in cases where multiple messages were generated during the\n\
    \   same time slot, the sender could not generate a time stamp, or\n   messages\
    \ originated from different hosts whose clocks were not\n   synchronized.  The\
    \ order of syslog message arrival via this transport\n   SHOULD NOT be used as\
    \ an authoritative guide in establishing an\n   absolute or relative sequence\
    \ of events on the syslog sender hosts.\n"
- title: 5.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "5.  Security Considerations\n   Using this specification on an unsecured network\
    \ is NOT RECOMMENDED.\n   Several syslog security considerations are discussed\
    \ in RFC 5424 [2].\n   This section focuses on security considerations specific\
    \ to the\n   syslog transport over UDP.  Some of the security issues raised in\n\
    \   this section can be mitigated through the use of IPsec as defined in\n   RFC\
    \ 4301 [10].\n"
- title: 5.1.  Sender Authentication and Message Forgery
  contents:
  - "5.1.  Sender Authentication and Message Forgery\n   This transport mapping does\
    \ not provide for strong sender\n   authentication.  The receiver of the syslog\
    \ message will not be able\n   to ascertain that the message was indeed sent from\
    \ the reported\n   sender, or whether the packet was sent from another device.\
    \  This can\n   also lead to a case of mistaken identity if an inappropriately\n\
    \   configured machine sends syslog messages to a receiver representing\n   itself\
    \ as another machine.\n   This transport mapping does not provide protection against\
    \ syslog\n   message forgery.  An attacker can transmit syslog messages (either\n\
    \   from the machine from which the messages are purportedly sent or from\n  \
    \ any other machine) to a receiver.\n   In one case, an attacker can hide the\
    \ true nature of an attack amidst\n   many other messages.  As an example, an\
    \ attacker can start generating\n   forged messages indicating a problem on some\
    \ machine.  This can get\n   the attention of the system administrators, who will\
    \ spend their time\n   investigating the alleged problem.  During this time, the\
    \ attacker\n   could be able to compromise a different machine or a different\n\
    \   process on the same machine.\n   Additionally, an attacker can generate false\
    \ syslog messages to give\n   untrue indications of the status of systems.  As\
    \ an example, an\n   attacker can stop a critical process on a machine, which\
    \ could\n   generate a notification of exit.  The attacker can subsequently\n\
    \   generate a forged notification that the process had been restarted.\n   The\
    \ system administrators could accept that misinformation and not\n   verify that\
    \ the process had indeed not been restarted.\n"
- title: 5.2.  Message Observation
  contents:
  - "5.2.  Message Observation\n   This transport mapping does not provide confidentiality\
    \ of the\n   messages in transit.  If syslog messages are in clear text, this\
    \ is\n   how they will be transferred.  In most cases, passing clear-text,\n \
    \  human-readable messages is a benefit to the administrators.\n   Unfortunately,\
    \ an attacker could also be able to observe the human-\n   readable contents of\
    \ syslog messages.  The attacker could then use\n   the knowledge gained from\
    \ these messages to compromise a machine.  It\n   is RECOMMENDED that no sensitive\
    \ information be transmitted via this\n   transport mapping or that transmission\
    \ of such information be\n   restricted to properly secured networks.\n"
- title: 5.3.  Replaying
  contents:
  - "5.3.  Replaying\n   Message forgery and observation can be combined into a replay\
    \ attack.\n   An attacker could record a set of messages that indicate normal\n\
    \   activity of a machine.  At a later time, an attacker could remove\n   that\
    \ machine from the network and replay the syslog messages with new\n   time stamps.\
    \  The administrators could find nothing unusual in the\n   received messages,\
    \ and their receipt would falsely indicate normal\n   activity of the machine.\n"
- title: 5.4.  Unreliable Delivery
  contents:
  - "5.4.  Unreliable Delivery\n   As was previously discussed in Section 4, Reliability\
    \ Considerations,\n   the UDP transport is not reliable, and packets containing\
    \ syslog\n   message datagrams can be lost in transit without any notice.  There\n\
    \   can be security consequences to the loss of one or more syslog\n   messages.\
    \  Administrators could be unaware of a developing and\n   potentially serious\
    \ problem.  Messages could also be intercepted and\n   discarded by an attacker\
    \ as a way to hide unauthorized activities.\n"
- title: 5.5.  Message Prioritization and Differentiation
  contents:
  - "5.5.  Message Prioritization and Differentiation\n   This transport mapping does\
    \ not mandate prioritization of syslog\n   messages either on the wire or when\
    \ processed on the receiving host\n   based on their severity.  Unless some prioritization\
    \ is implemented\n   by sender, receiver, and/or network, the security implication\
    \ of such\n   behavior is that the syslog receiver or network devices could get\n\
    \   overwhelmed with low-severity messages and be forced to discard\n   potentially\
    \ high-severity messages.\n"
- title: 5.6.  Denial of Service
  contents:
  - "5.6.  Denial of Service\n   An attacker could overwhelm a receiver by sending\
    \ more messages to it\n   than could be handled by the infrastructure or the device\
    \ itself.\n   Implementers SHOULD attempt to provide features that minimize this\n\
    \   threat, such as optionally restricting reception of messages to a set\n  \
    \ of known source IP addresses.\n"
