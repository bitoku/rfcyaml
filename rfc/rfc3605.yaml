  - "Abstract\n   The Session Description Protocol (SDP) is used to describe the\n\
    \   parameters of media streams used in multimedia sessions.  When a\n   session\
    \ requires multiple ports, SDP assumes that these ports have\n   consecutive numbers.\
    \  However, when the session crosses a network\n   address translation device\
    \ that also uses port mapping, the ordering\n   of ports can be destroyed by the\
    \ translation.  To handle this, we\n   propose an extension attribute to SDP.\n"
- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   The session invitation protocol (SIP, [RFC3261]) is often\
    \ used to\n   establish multi-media sessions on the Internet.  There are often\n\
    \   cases today in which one or both ends of the connection are hidden\n   behind\
    \ a network address translation device [RFC2766].  In this case,\n   the SDP text\
    \ must document the IP addresses and UDP ports as they\n   appear on the \"public\
    \ Internet\" side of the NAT.  In this memo, we\n   will suppose that the host\
    \ located behind a NAT has a way to obtain\n   these numbers.  A possible way\
    \ to learn these numbers is briefly\n   outlined in section 3, however, just learning\
    \ the numbers is not\n   enough.\n   The SIP messages use the encoding defined\
    \ in SDP [RFC2327] to\n   describe the IP addresses and TCP or UDP ports used\
    \ by the various\n   media.  Audio and video are typically sent using RTP [RFC3550],\
    \ which\n   requires two UDP ports, one for the media and one for the control\n\
    \   protocol (RTCP).  SDP carries only one port number per media, and\n   states\
    \ that \"other ports used by the media application (such as the\n   RTCP port)\
    \ should be derived algorithmically from the base media\n   port.\"  RTCP port\
    \ numbers were necessarily derived from the base\n   media port in older versions\
    \ of RTP (such as [RFC1889]), but now that\n   this restriction has been lifted,\
    \ there is a need to specify RTCP\n   ports explicitly in SDP.  Note, however,\
    \ that implementations of RTP\n   adhering to the earlier [RFC1889] specification\
    \ may not be able to\n   make use of the SDP attributes specified in this document.\n\
    \   When the NAT device performs port mapping, there is no guarantee that\n  \
    \ the mappings of two separate ports reflects the sequencing and the\n   parity\
    \ of the original port numbers; in fact, when the NAT manages a\n   pool of IP\
    \ addresses, it is even possible that the RTP and the RTCP\n   ports may be mapped\
    \ to different addresses.  In order to successfully\n   establish connections\
    \ despite the misordering of the port numbers and\n   the possible parity switches\
    \ caused by the NAT, we propose to use a\n   specific SDP attribute to document\
    \ the RTCP port and optionally the\n   RTCP address.\n   The key words \"MUST\"\
    , \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD\
    \ NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n   document are to\
    \ be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].\n"
- title: 2.  Description of the Solution
  contents:
  - "2.  Description of the Solution\n   The main part of our solution is the declaration\
    \ of an SDP attribute\n   for documenting the port used by RTCP.\n"
- title: 2.1.  The RTCP Attribute
  contents:
  - "2.1.  The RTCP Attribute\n   The RTCP attribute is used to document the RTCP\
    \ port used for media\n   stream, when that port is not the next higher (odd)\
    \ port number\n   following the RTP port described in the media line.  The RTCP\n\
    \   attribute is a \"value\" attribute, and follows the general syntax\n   specified\
    \ page 18 of [RFC2327]: \"a=<attribute>:<value>\".  For the\n   RTCP attribute:\n\
    \   *  the name is the ascii string \"rtcp\" (lower case),\n   *  the value is\
    \ the RTCP port number and optional address.\n   The formal description of the\
    \ attribute is defined by the following\n   ABNF [RFC2234] syntax:\n   rtcp-attribute\
    \ =  \"a=rtcp:\" port  [nettype space addrtype space\n                       \
    \  connection-address] CRLF\n   In this description, the \"port\", \"nettype\"\
    , \"addrtype\" and\n   \"connection-address\" tokens are defined as specified\
    \ in \"Appendix A:\n   SDP Grammar\" of [RFC2327].\n   Example encodings could\
    \ be:\n    m=audio 49170 RTP/AVP 0\n    a=rtcp:53020\n    m=audio 49170 RTP/AVP\
    \ 0\n    a=rtcp:53020 IN IP4 126.16.64.4\n    m=audio 49170 RTP/AVP 0\n    a=rtcp:53020\
    \ IN IP6 2001:2345:6789:ABCD:EF01:2345:6789:ABCD\n   The RTCP attribute MAY be\
    \ used as a media level attribute; it MUST\n   NOT be used as a session level\
    \ attribute.  Though the examples below\n   relate to a method that will return\
    \ only unicast addresses, both\n   unicast and multicast values are valid.\n"
- title: 3.  Discussion of the Solution
  contents:
  - "3.  Discussion of the Solution\n   The implementation of the solution is fairly\
    \ straightforward.  The\n   questions that have been most often asked regarding\
    \ this solution are\n   whether this is useful, i.e., whether a host can actually\
    \ discover\n   port numbers in an unmodified NAT, whether it is sufficient, i.e.,\n\
    \   whether or not there is a need to document more than one ancillary\n   port\
    \ per media type, and whether why should not change the media\n   definition instead\
    \ of adding a new attribute.\n"
- title: 3.1.  How do we Discover Port Numbers?
  contents:
  - "3.1.  How do we Discover Port Numbers?\n   The proposed solution is only useful\
    \ if the host can discover the\n   \"translated port numbers\", i.e., the value\
    \ of the ports as they\n   appear on the \"external side\" of the NAT.  One possibility\
    \ is to ask\n   the cooperation of a well connected third party that will act\
    \ as a\n   server according to STUN [RFC3489].  We thus obtain a four step\n \
    \  process:\n   1 - The host allocates two UDP ports numbers for an RTP/RTCP pair,\n\
    \   2 - The host sends a UDP message from each port to the STUN server,\n   3\
    \ - The STUN server reads the source address and port of the packet,\n       and\
    \ copies them in the text of a reply,\n   4 - The host parses the reply according\
    \ to the STUN protocol and\n       learns the external address and port corresponding\
    \ to each of the\n       two UDP ports.\n   This algorithm supposes that the NAT\
    \ will use the same translation\n   for packets sent to the third party and to\
    \ the \"SDP peer\" with which\n   the host wants to establish a connection.  There\
    \ is no guarantee that\n   all NAT boxes deployed on the Internet have this characteristic.\n\
    \   Implementers are referred to the STUN specification [RFC3489] for an\n   extensive\
    \ discussion of the various types of NAT.\n"
- title: 3.2.  Do we need to Support Multiple Ports?
  contents:
  - "3.2.  Do we need to Support Multiple Ports?\n   Most media streams are transmitted\
    \ using a single pair of RTP and\n   RTCP ports.  It is possible, however, to\
    \ transmit a single media over\n   several RTP flows, for example using hierarchical\
    \ encoding.  In this\n   case, SDP will encode the port number used by RTP on\
    \ the first flow,\n   and the number of flows, as in:\n      m=video 49170/2 RTP/AVP\
    \ 31\n   In this example, the media is sent over 2 consecutive pairs of ports,\n\
    \   corresponding respectively to RTP for the first flow (even number,\n   49170),\
    \ RTCP for the first flow (odd number, 49171), RTP for the\n   second flow (even\
    \ number, 49172), and RTCP for the second flow (odd\n   number, 49173).\n   In\
    \ theory, it would be possible to modify SDP and document the many\n   ports corresponding\
    \ to the separate encoding layers.  However,\n   layered encoding is not much\
    \ used in practice, and when used is\n   mostly used in conjunction with multicast\
    \ transmission.  The\n   translation issues documented in this memo apply uniquely\
    \ to unicast\n   transmission, and thus there is no short term need for the support\
    \ of\n   multiple port descriptions.  It is more convenient and more robust to\n\
    \   focus on the simple case in which a media is sent over exactly one\n   RTP/RTCP\
    \ stream.\n"
- title: 3.3.  Why not Expand the Media Definition?
  contents:
  - "3.3.  Why not Expand the Media Definition?\n   The RTP ports are documented in\
    \ the media description line, and it\n   would seem convenient to document the\
    \ RTCP port at the same place,\n   rather than create an RTCP attribute.  We considered\
    \ this design\n   alternative and rejected it for two reasons: adding an extra\
    \ port\n   number and an option address in the media description would be\n  \
    \ awkward, and more importantly it would create problems with existing\n   applications,\
    \ which would have to reject the entire media description\n   if they did not\
    \ understand the extension.  On the contrary, adding an\n   attribute has a well\
    \ defined failure mode: implementations that don't\n   understand the \"a=rtcp\"\
    \ attribute will simply ignore it; they will\n   fail to send RTCP packets to\
    \ the specified address, but they will at\n   least be able to receive the media\
    \ in the RTP packets.\n"
- title: 4.  UNSAF Considerations
  contents:
  - "4.  UNSAF Considerations\n   The RTCP attribute in SDP is used to enable establishment\
    \ of RTP/RTCP\n   flows through NAT.  This mechanism can be used in conjunction\
    \ with an\n   address discovery mechanism such as STUN [RFC3489].  STUN is a short\n\
    \   term fix to the NAT traversal problem, which requires thus\n   consideration\
    \ of the general issues linked to \"Unilateral self-\n   address fixing\" [RFC3424].\n\
    \   The RTCP attribute addresses a very specific problem, the\n   documentation\
    \ of port numbers as they appear after address\n   translation by a port-mapping\
    \ NAT.  The RTCP attribute SHOULD NOT be\n   used for other applications.\n  \
    \ We expect that, with time, one of two exit strategies can be\n   developed.\
    \  The IETF may develop an explicit \"middlebox control\"\n   protocol that will\
    \ enable applications to obtain a pair of port\n   numbers appropriate for RTP\
    \ and RTCP.  Another possibility is the\n   deployment of IPv6, which will enable\
    \ use of \"end to end\" addressing\n   and guarantee that the two hosts will be\
    \ able to use appropriate\n   ports.  In both cases, there will be no need for\
    \ documenting a \"non\n   standard\" RTCP port with the RTCP attribute.\n"
- title: 5.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "5.  Security Considerations\n   This SDP extension is not believed to introduce\
    \ any significant\n   security risk to multi-media applications.  One could conceive\
    \ that a\n   malevolent third party would use the extension to redirect the RTCP\n\
    \   fraction of an RTP exchange, but this requires intercepting and\n   rewriting\
    \ the signaling packet carrying the SDP text; if an\n   interceptor can do that,\
    \ many more attacks are available, including a\n   wholesale change of the addresses\
    \ and port numbers at which the media\n   will be sent.\n   In order to avoid\
    \ attacks of this sort, when SDP is used in a\n   signaling packet where it is\
    \ of the form application/sdp, end-to-end\n   integrity using S/MIME [RFC3369]\
    \ is the technical method to be\n   implemented and applied.  This is compatible\
    \ with SIP [RFC3261].\n"
