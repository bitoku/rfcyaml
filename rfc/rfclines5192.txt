Abstract This document defines new DHCPv4 and DHCPv6 options that contain a list of IP addresses to locate one or more PANA (Protocol for carrying Authentication for Network Access)
This is one of the methods that a PANA Client (PaC) can use to locate PAAs.
Introduction The Protocol for carrying Authentication for Network Access (PANA)
[RFC5191] defines a new Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP)
[RFC3748] lower layer that uses IP between the protocol end points.
The PANA protocol is run between a PANA Client (PaC) and a PANA Authentication Agent (PAA) in order to perform authentication and authorization for the network access service.
This document specifies DHCPv4 [RFC2131] and DHCPv6 [RFC3315] options that allow PANA clients (PaCs) to discover PANA Authentication Agents (PAAs).
This is one of the methods for locating PAAs.
The DHCP options defined in this document are used only as a PAA discovery mechanism.
These DHCP options MUST NOT be used to perform any negotiation of the use of PANA between the PaC and a PAA.
In this document, several words are used to signify the requirements of the specification.
These words are often capitalized.
The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].
This document uses the DHCP terminology defined in [RFC2131], [RFC2132], and [RFC3315].
This document uses the PANA terminology defined in [RFC5191].
In particular, the following terms are defined: PANA Client (PaC):
The client side of the protocol that resides in the access device (e.g., laptop, PDA, etc.).
It is responsible for providing the credentials in order to prove its identity (authentication) for network access authorization.
The PaC and the EAP peer are co located in the same access device.
The protocol entity in the access network whose responsibility it is to verify the credentials provided by a PANA client (PaC) and authorize network access to the access device.
The PAA and the EAP authenticator (and optionally the EAP server) are colocated in the same node.
PANA Authentication Agent DHCPv4 Option
This DHCPv4 option carries a list of 32 bit (binary)
IPv4 addresses indicating PANA Authentication Agents (PAAs) available to the PANA client (PaC).
The DHCPv4 option for PANA Authentication Agent has the format shown in Figure 1. 0
1 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6
Figure 1: PAA DHCPv4 option option code:
Length of the 'options' field in octets; MUST be a multiple of four (4).
PAA IPv4 Address:   IPv4 address of a PAA for the client to use.
The PAAs are listed in the order of preference for use by the client.
A PaC (DHCPv4 client) SHOULD request the PAA DHCPv4 Option in a Parameter Request List, as described in [RFC2131] and [RFC2132].
If configured with a (list of) PAA address(es), a DHCPv4 server SHOULD send a client the PAA DHCPv4 option, even if this option is not explicitly requested by the client.
A PaC (DHCPv4 client) receiving the PAA DHCPv4 option SHOULD use the (list of) IP address(es) to locate PAA(s).
The PaC (DHCPv4 client) MUST try the records in the order listed in the PAA DHCPv4 option received from the DHCPv4 server.
PANA Authentication Agent DHCPv6 Option
This DHCPv6 option carries a list of 128 bit (binary)
IPv6 addresses indicating PANA Authentication Agents (PAAs) available to the PANA client (PaC).
The DHCPv6 option for PANA Authentication Agent has the format shown in Figure 2. 0
PAA DHCPv6 option option code:
Length of the 'options' field in octets; MUST be a multiple of sixteen (16).
PAA IPv6 Address:   IPv6 address of a PAA for the client to use.
The PAAs are listed in the order of preference for use by the client.
A PaC DHCPv6 client SHOULD request the PAA DHCPv6 option in an Options Request Option (ORO) as described in the DHCPv6 specification [RFC3315].
If configured with a (list of) PAA address(es), a DHCPv6 server SHOULD send a client the PAA DHCPv6 option, even if this option is not explicitly requested by the client.
A PaC (DHCPv6 client) receiving the PAA DHCPv6 option SHOULD use the (list of) IP address(es) to locate PAA(s).
The PaC (DHCPv6 client) MUST try the records in the order listed in the PAA DHCPv6 option received from the DHCPv6 server.
The following DHCPv4 option code for PANA Authentication Agent options has been assigned by IANA:
The following DHCPv6 option code for PANA Authentication Agent options has been assigned by IANA:
The security considerations in [RFC2131], [RFC2132], and [RFC3315] apply.
If an adversary manages to modify the response from a DHCP server or insert its own response, a PANA Client could be led to contact a rogue PANA Authentication Agent, possibly one that then intercepts authentication requests and/or denies network access to the access device.
In most networks, the DHCP exchange that delivers the options prior to network access authentication is neither integrity protected nor origin authenticated.
Therefore, the options defined in this document MUST NOT be used to perform any negotiation on the use of PANA between the PANA Client and a PANA Authentication Agent.
Using the presence (or absence) of these DHCP options as an indication of network mandating PANA authentication (or not) is an example of such a negotiation mechanism.
This negotiation would allow bidding down attacks by making the clients choose to use a lower grade security mechanism (or even no security at all).
