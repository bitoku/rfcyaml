Abstract This document defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB) for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
In particular, it describes managed objects used for managing the Bootstrap Router (BSR) mechanism for PIM (Protocol Independent Multicast).
This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB) for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
In particular, it describes managed objects used for managing the Bootstrap Router (BSR) mechanism for PIM [RFC4601],
This document was created by moving some of the PIM BSR specific MIB tables from one of the earlier versions of PIM MIB [RFC5060].
The Internet Standard Management Framework
For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current Internet Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of RFC 3410 [RFC3410].
Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed the Management Information Base or MIB.
MIB objects are generally accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the Structure of Management Information (SMI).
This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58, RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58
, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119
This MIB module contains four tables.
The Candidate RP Table, which contains one row for each multicast group address prefix for which the local router is configured to advertise itself as a Candidate RP (C RP).
This table exists on routers that are configured as Candidate RP.
The Elected BSR RP Set Table, which contains one row for each Group to RP mapping that was received in C RP advertisements.
This table exists on a router that is an elected BSR (E BSR).
The Candidate BSR Table, which contains one row for each Candidate BSR configuration for the local router.
This table exists on routers that are configured as Candidate BSR.
The Elected BSR Table, which contains one row for each elected BSR.
This table exists on a router that is an elected BSR.
This MIB module uses textual conventions defined in the INET ADDRESS

A collection of objects for managing the Bootstrap Router (BSR) mechanism for PIM routers."
current DESCRIPTION "Objects providing additional diagnostics related to the Bootstrap Router (BSR) mechanism for PIM routers."
There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB module with a MAX ACCESS clause of read write and/or read create.
Such objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.
The support for SET operations in a non secure environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on network operations.
These are the tables and objects and their sensitivity/vulnerability:
A new Candidate BSR with high priority or modification of priority ( bsrCandidateBSRPriority ) of an existing Candidate BSR can take over the functionality of an Elected BSR, which can prevent and disrupt the services.
A new Candidate RP with lower priority or modification of priority ( bsrCandidateRPPriority ) of an existing Candidate RP can force other routers to select itself for a particular group prefix.
This can prevent and disrupt the services provided through this group prefix.
The following are the read write and read create objects defined in this MIB module:
Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a MAX ACCESS other than not accessible) may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.
It is thus important to control
even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over the network via SNMP.
These are the tables and objects and their sensitivity/vulnerability: pimBsrCandidateRPAdvTimer pimBsrElectedBSRRPSetPriority pimBsrElectedBSRRPSetHoldtime
pimBsrCandidateBSRElectedBSR pimBsrCandidateBSRBootstrapTimer pimBsrElectedBSRAddressType pimBsrElectedBSRAddress pimBsrElectedBSRPriority pimBsrElectedBSRHashMaskLength pimBsrElectedBSRExpiryTime
In this MIB module, possible effects that can be induced by GET operations include:  Determination of Elected BSR, Candidate BSRs, and Candidate RPs in the Multicast Network topology.
This information may be sensitive and may be used in preparation for Denial of Service (DoS) attacks including any of the attacks described above.
SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPsec), there is still no control over whom on the secure network is allowed to access (read/change/create/delete)
the objects in this MIB module.
It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8), including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for authentication and privacy).
Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT RECOMMENDED.
Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to enable cryptographic security.
It is then a customer/operator responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate rights to access (read/change/create/delete) them.
The MIB module in this document uses the following IANA assigned OBJECT IDENTIFIER values recorded in the SMI Numbers registry:
{ mib 2 172 }
