Abstract This document specifies a set of cipher suites for the Transport Security Layer (TLS) protocol to support the Camellia encryption algorithm as a block cipher.
It amends the cipher suites originally specified in RFC 4132 by introducing counterparts using the newer cryptographic hash algorithms from the SHA 2 family.
This document obsoletes RFC 4132.
This document proposes the addition of new cipher suites to the Transport Layer Security (TLS)
[RFC5246] protocol to support the Camellia [RFC3713] encryption algorithm as a block cipher algorithm, adding variants using the SHA 2 family of cryptographic hash algorithms [FIPS180 3] to the TLS cipher suite portfolio originally specified in RFC 4132
This document obsoletes RFC 4132.
The Camellia algorithm and its properties are described in [RFC3713].
The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].
The cipher suites defined here have the following identifiers: CipherSuite TLS RSA WITH CAMELLIA 128
{ 0x00,0xBE }; CipherSuite TLS DH anon WITH CAMELLIA 128
The RSA, DHE RSA, DH RSA, DHE DSS, DH DSS, and DH anon key exchanges are performed as defined in [RFC5246].
The CAMELLIA 128 CBC cipher suites use Camellia [RFC3713] in Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) mode with a 128 bit key and 128 bit
IV; the CAMELLIA 256 CBC cipher suites use a 256 bit key and 128 bit IV.
3.3.  Hash and Pseudorandom Function 3.3.1.
Hash and Pseudorandom Function for TLS 1.1
The cipher suites ending with  SHA use HMAC SHA1 as the MAC algorithm.
When used with TLS versions prior to 1.2, the pseudorandom function (PRF) is calculated as specified in the appropriate version of the TLS specification.
Hash and Pseudorandom Function for TLS 1.2
The cipher suites ending with  SHA256 use HMAC SHA 256 as the MAC algorithm.
The PRF is the TLS PRF [RFC5246] with SHA 256 as the hash function.
These cipher suites MUST NOT be negotiated by TLS 1.1 or earlier versions.
Clients MUST NOT offer these cipher suites if they do not offer TLS 1.2 or later.
Servers that select an earlier version of TLS MUST NOT select one of these cipher suites.
IANA Considerations IANA has updated the entries for the following numbers that were allocated in RFC 4132 to reference this document: CipherSuite TLS RSA WITH CAMELLIA 128
CipherSuite TLS RSA WITH CAMELLIA 128
{ 0x00,0xBE }; CipherSuite TLS DH anon WITH CAMELLIA 128
At the time of writing this document, there are no known weak keys for Camellia, and no security problem has been found on Camellia (see [NESSIE], [CRYPTREC], and [LNCS]).
Also, security issues are discussed throughout RFC 5246 [RFC5246], especially in Appendices D, E, and F.
