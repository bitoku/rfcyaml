  - "1.  Introduction\n   The objective of Pre-Congestion Notification (PCN) is to\
    \ protect the\n   quality of service (QoS) of inelastic flows within a Diffserv\
    \ domain,\n   in a simple, scalable, and robust fashion.  Two mechanisms are used:\n\
    \   admission control to decide whether to admit or block a new flow\n   request\
    \ and, in abnormal circumstances, flow termination to decide\n   whether to terminate\
    \ some of the existing flows.  To achieve this,\n   the overall rate of PCN-traffic\
    \ is metered on every link in the PCN-\n   domain, and PCN-packets are appropriately\
    \ marked when certain\n   configured rates are exceeded.  These configured rates\
    \ are below the\n   rate of the link, thus providing notification to PCN-boundary-nodes\n\
    \   about incipient overloads before any congestion occurs (hence the\n   \"pre\"\
    \ part of \"pre-congestion notification\").  The level of marking\n   allows decisions\
    \ to be made about whether to admit or terminate PCN-\n   flows.  For more details,\
    \ see [RFC5559].\n   This document describes an experimental edge-node behavior\
    \ to\n   implement PCN in a network.  The experiment may be run in a network\n\
    \   in which a substantial proportion of the traffic carried is in the\n   form\
    \ of inelastic flows and where admission control of micro-flows is\n   applied\
    \ at the edge.  For the effects of PCN to be observable, the\n   committed bandwidth\
    \ (i.e., level of non-best-effort traffic) on at\n   least some links of the network\
    \ should be near or at link capacity.\n   The amount of effort required to prepare\
    \ the network for the\n   experiment (see Section 5.1) may constrain the size\
    \ of network to\n   which it is applied.  The purposes of the experiment are:\n\
    \   o  to validate the specification of the CL edge behavior;\n   o  to evaluate\
    \ the effectiveness of the CL edge behavior in\n      preserving quality of service\
    \ for admitted flows; and\n   o  to evaluate PCN's potential for reducing the\
    \ amount of capital and\n      operational costs in comparison to alternative\
    \ methods of assuring\n      quality of service.\n   For the first two objectives,\
    \ the experiment should run long enough\n   for the network to experience sharp\
    \ peaks of traffic in at least some\n   directions.  It would also be desirable\
    \ to observe PCN performance in\n   the face of failures in the network.  A period\
    \ on the order of a\n   month or two in busy season may be enough.  The third\
    \ objective is\n   more difficult and could require observation over a period\
    \ long\n   enough for traffic demand to grow to the point where additional\n \
    \  capacity must be provisioned at some points in the network.\n   Section 3 of\
    \ this document specifies a detailed set of algorithms and\n   procedures used\
    \ to implement the PCN mechanisms for the CL mode of\n   operation.  Since the\
    \ algorithms depend on specific metering and\n   marking behavior at the interior\
    \ nodes, it is also necessary to\n   specify the assumptions made about PCN-interior-node\
    \ behavior\n   (Section 2).  Finally, because PCN uses Diffserv codepoint (DSCP)\n\
    \   values to carry its markings, a specification of PCN-boundary-node\n   behavior\
    \ must include the per-domain behavior (PDB) template\n   specified in [RFC3086],\
    \ filled out with the appropriate content\n   (Section 4).\n   Note that the terms\
    \ \"block\" or \"terminate\" actually translate to one\n   or more of several\
    \ possible courses of action, as discussed in\n   Section 3.6 of [RFC5559].  The\
    \ choice of which action to take for\n   blocked or terminated flows is a matter\
    \ of local policy.\n   A companion document [RFC6662] specifies the Single Marking\
    \ (SM) PCN-\n   boundary-node behavior.  This document and [RFC6662] have a great\n\
    \   deal of text in common.  To simplify the task of the reader, the text\n  \
    \ in the present document that is specific to the CL PCN-boundary-node\n   behavior\
    \ is preceded by the phrase \"[CL-specific]\".  A similar\n   distinction for\
    \ SM-specific text is made in [RFC6662].\n"

    \ PCN-BA\n      A PCN-domain carries traffic of different Diffserv behavior\n\
    \      aggregates (BAs) [RFC2474].  The PCN-BA uses the PCN mechanisms to\n  \
    \    carry PCN-traffic, and the corresponding packets are PCN-packets.\n     \
    \ The same network will carry traffic of other Diffserv BAs.  The\n      PCN-BA\
    \ is distinguished by a combination of the Diffserv codepoint\n      and the ECN\
    \ field.\n   This document uses the following terms from [RFC5670]:\n   o  [CL-specific]\

    \ codepoint;\n   o  [CL-specific] threshold-marked (ThM) codepoint;\n   o  excess-traffic-marked\

    \ a report automatically at the\n   end of each measurement interval.\n   1. \
    \ As well as the quantities NM-rate, [CL-specific] ThM-rate, and\n       ETM-rate,\

    \ for the latest measurement interval.\n   Each report sent to the Decision Point\
    \ when report suppression has\n   been activated MUST contain the values of NM-rate,\
    \ [CL-specific] ThM-\n   rate, ETM-rate, and CLE that were calculated for the\
    \ most recent\n   measurement interval.  [CL-specific] If the PCN-egress-node\

    \   marking was observed in the most recent measurement interval, then it\n  \
    \ MUST also include these identifiers in the report.\n   The above procedure ensures\
    \ that at least one report is sent per\n   interval (T_maxsuppress + T_meas).\
    \  This demonstrates to the Decision\n   Point that both the PCN-egress-node and\

    \ multipath routing in domains upstream\n   of the PCN-domain, it is impossible\
    \ to do such classification\n   reliably at the PCN-egress-node based on the packet\
    \ header contents\n   as originally received at the PCN-ingress-node.  (Packets\
    \ with the\n   same header contents could enter the PCN-domain at multiple PCN-\n\
    \   ingress-nodes.)  As a result, the only way to construct such filters\n   reliably\
    \ is to tunnel the packets from the PCN-ingress-node to the\n   PCN-egress-node.\n\
    \   The PCN-ingress-node needs filters in order to place PCN packets into\n  \
    \ the right tunnel in the first instance, and also to satisfy requests\n   from\
    \ the Decision Point for admission rates into specific ingress-\n   egress-aggregates.\
    \  These filters select the PCN-egress-node, but not\n   necessarily a specific\
    \ path through the network to that node.  As a\n   result, they are likely to\
    \ be stable even in the face of failures in\n   the network, except when the PCN-egress-node\
    \ itself becomes\n   unreachable.  If all PCN packets will be tunneled, the PCN-ingress-\n\
    \   node also needs to know the address of the peer PCN-egress-node\n   associated\
    \ with each filter.\n   Operators may wish to give some thought to the provisioning\
    \ of\n   alternate egress points for some or all ingress-egress-aggregates in\n\

    \ needs filters to classify incoming PCN packets\n   by ingress-egress-aggregate,\
    \ in order to gather measurements on a\n   per-aggregate basis.  If tunneling\
    \ is used, these filters are\n   constructed on the basis of the identifier of\
    \ the tunnel from which\n   the incoming packet has emerged (e.g., the source\
    \ address in the\n   outer header if IP encapsulation is used).  The PCN-egress-node\
    \ also\n   needs to know the address of the Decision Point to which it sends\n\
    \   reports for each ingress-egress-aggregate.\n   A centralized Decision Point\
    \ needs to have the address of the PCN-\n   ingress-node corresponding to each\

  - "6.  Security Considerations\n   [RFC5559] provides a general description of the\
    \ security\n   considerations for PCN.  This memo introduces one new consideration,\n\
    \   related to the use of a centralized Decision Point.  The Decision\n   Point\
    \ itself is a trusted entity.  However, its use implies the\n   existence of an\
    \ interface on the PCN-ingress-node through which\n   communication of policy\
    \ decisions takes place.  That interface is a\n   point of vulnerability that\
    \ must be protected from denial-of-service\n   attacks.\n"
