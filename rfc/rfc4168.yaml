  - "1.  Introduction\n   The Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) [4] has
    been designed\n   as a new transport protocol for the Internet (or intranets)
    at the\n   same layer as TCP and UDP.  SCTP has been designed with the transport\n
    \  of legacy SS7 signaling messages in mind.  We have observed that many\n   of
    the features designed to support transport of such signaling are\n   also useful
    for the transport of SIP (the Session Initiation\n   Protocol) [5], which is used
    to initiate and manage interactive\n   sessions on the Internet.\n   SIP itself
    is transport-independent, and can run over any reliable or\n   unreliable message
    or stream transport.  However, procedures are only\n   defined for transport over
    UDP and TCP.  This document defines\n   transport of SIP over SCTP.\n"

    [10].  We\n   summarize some of these benefits here and analyze how they relate
    to\n   SIP (a more detailed analysis can be found in [12]).\n"
  - contents:
    - "3.1.  Advantages over UDP\n   All the advantages that SCTP has over UDP regarding
      SIP transport are\n   also shared by TCP.  Below, there is a list of the general
      advantages\n   that a connection-oriented transport protocol such as TCP or
      SCTP has\n   over a connection-less transport protocol such as UDP.\n   Fast
      Retransmit: SCTP can quickly determine the loss of a packet,\n      because
      of its usage of SACK and a mechanism that sends SACK\n      messages faster
      than normal when losses are detected.  The result\n      is that losses of SIP
      messages can be detected much faster than\n      when SIP is run over UDP (detection
      will take at least 500 ms, if\n      not more).  Note that TCP SACK exists as
      well, and TCP also has a\n      fast retransmit option.  Over an existing connection,
      this results\n      in faster call setup times under conditions of packet loss,
      which\n      is very desirable.  This is probably the most significant\n      advantage
      of SCTP for SIP transport.\n   Congestion Control: SCTP maintains congestion
      control over the entire\n      association.  For SIP, this means that the aggregate
      rate of\n      messages between two entities can be controlled.  When SIP is
      run\n      over TCP, the same advantages are afforded.  However, when run\n
      \     over UDP, SIP provides less effective congestion control.  This is\n      because
      congestion state (measured in terms of the UDP retransmit\n      interval) is
      computed on a transaction-by-transaction basis,\n      rather than across all
      transactions.  Thus, congestion control\n      performance is similar to opening
      N parallel TCP connections, as\n      opposed to sending N messages over one
      TCP connection.\n   Transport-Layer Fragmentation: SCTP and TCP provide transport-layer\n
      \     fragmentation.  If a SIP message is larger than the MTU size, it\n      is
      fragmented at the transport layer.  When UDP is used,\n      fragmentation occurs
      at the IP layer.  IP fragmentation increases\n      the likelihood of having
      packet losses and makes NAT and firewall\n      traversal difficult, if not
      impossible.  This feature will become\n      important if the size of SIP messages
      grows dramatically.\n"
    title: 3.1.  Advantages over UDP
  - contents:
    - "3.2.  Advantages over TCP\n   We have shown the advantages of SCTP and TCP
      over UDP.  We now\n   analyze the advantages of SCTP over TCP.\n   Head of the
      Line: SCTP is message-based, as opposed to TCP, which is\n      stream-based.
      \ This allows SCTP to separate different signalling\n      messages at the transport
      layer.  TCP only understands bytes.\n      Assembling received bytes to form
      signalling messages is performed\n      at the application layer.  Therefore,
      TCP always delivers an\n      ordered stream of bytes to the application.  On
      the other hand,\n      SCTP can deliver signalling messages to the application
      as soon as\n      they arrive (when using the unordered service).  The loss
      of a\n      signalling message does not affect the delivery of the rest of the\n
      \     messages.  This avoids the head of line blocking problem in TCP,\n      which
      occurs when multiple higher layer connections are\n      multiplexed within
      a single TCP connection.  A SIP transaction can\n      be considered an application
      layer connection.  There are multiple\n      transactions running between proxies.
      \ The loss of a message in\n      one transaction should not adversely effect
      the ability of a\n      different transaction to send a message.  Thus, if SIP
      is run\n      between entities with many transactions occurring in parallel,\n
      \     SCTP can provide improved performance over SIP over TCP (but not\n      SIP
      over UDP; SIP over UDP is not ideal from a congestion control\n      standpoint;
      see above).\n   Easier Parsing: Another advantage of message-based protocols,
      such as\n      SCTP and UDP, over stream-based protocols, such as TCP, is that\n
      \     they allow easier parsing of messages at the application layer.\n      There
      is no need to establish boundaries (typically using\n      Content-Length headers)
      between different messages.  However, this\n      advantage is almost negligible.\n
      \  Multihoming: An SCTP connection can be associated with multiple IP\n      addresses
      on the same host.  Data is always sent over one of the\n      addresses, but
      if it becomes unreachable, data sent to one can\n      migrate to a different
      address.  This improves fault tolerance;\n      network failures making one
      interface of the server unavailable do\n      not prevent the service from continuing
      to operate.  SIP servers\n      are likely to have substantial fault tolerance
      requirements.  It\n      is worth noting that, because SIP is message oriented
      and not\n      stream oriented, the existing SRV (Service Selection) procedures\n
      \     defined in [5] can accomplish the same goal, even when SIP is run\n      over
      TCP.  In fact, SRV records allow the 'connection' to fail\n      over to a separate
      host.  Since SIP proxies can run statelessly,\n      failover can be accomplished
      without data synchronization between\n      the primary and its backups.  Thus,
      the multihoming capabilities\n      of SCTP provide marginal benefits.\n   It
      is important to note that most of the benefits of SCTP for SIP\n   occur under
      loss conditions.  Therefore, under a zero loss condition,\n   SCTP transport
      of SIP should perform on par with TCP transport.\n   Research is needed to evaluate
      under what loss conditions the\n   improvements in setup times and throughput
      will be observed.\n"

  - "4.  Transport Parameter\n   Via header fields carry a transport protocol identifier.
    \ RFC 3261\n   defines the value \"SCTP\" for SCTP, but does not define the value
    for\n   the transport parameter for TLS over SCTP.  Note that the value\n   \"TLS\",
    defined by RFC 3261, is intended for TLS over TCP.\n   Here we define the value
    \"TLS-SCTP\" for the transport part of the Via\n   header field to be used for
    requests sent over TLS over SCTP [8].\n   The updated augmented BNF (Backus-Naur
    Form) [2] for this parameter\n   is the following (the original BNF for this parameter
    can be found in\n   RFC 3261):\n   transport         =  \"UDP\" / \"TCP\" / \"TLS\"
    / \"SCTP\" / \"TLS-SCTP\"\n                        / other-transport\n   The following
    are examples of Via header fields using \"SCTP\" and\n   \"TLS-SCTP\":\n     Via:
    SIP/2.0/SCTP ws1234.example.com:5060\n     Via: SIP/2.0/TLS-SCTP ws1234.example.com:5060\n"

  - "5.  SCTP Usage\n   Rules for sending a request over SCTP are identical to TCP.
    \ The only\n   difference is that an SCTP sender has to choose a particular stream\n
    \  within an association in order to send the request (see Section 5.1).\n   Note
    that no SCTP identifier needs to be defined for SIP messages.\n   Therefore, the
    Payload Protocol Identifier in SCTP DATA chunks\n   transporting SIP messages
    MUST be set to zero.\n   The SIP transport layers of both peers are responsible
    for managing\n   the persistent SCTP connection between them.  On the sender side,
    the\n   core or a client (or server) transaction generates a request (or\n   response)
    and passes it to the transport layer.  The transport sends\n   the request to
    the peer's transaction layer.  The peer's transaction\n   layer is responsible
    for delivering the incoming request (or\n   response) to the proper existing server
    (or client) transaction.  If\n   no server (or client) transaction exists for
    the incoming message,\n   the transport layer passes the request (or response)
    to the core,\n   which may decide to construct a new server (or client) transaction.\n"

    - "5.1.  Mapping of SIP Transactions into SCTP Streams\n   SIP transactions need
      to be mapped into SCTP streams in a way that\n   avoids Head Of the Line (HOL)
      blocking.  Among the different ways of\n   performing this mapping that fulfill
      this requirement, we have chosen\n   the simplest one; a SIP entity SHOULD send
      every SIP message (request\n   or response) over stream zero with the unordered
      flag set.  On the\n   receiving side, a SIP entity MUST be ready to receive
      SIP messages\n   over any stream.\n      In the past, it was proposed that SCTP
      stream IDs be used as\n      lightweight SIP transaction identifiers.  That
      proposal was\n      withdrawn because SIP now provides (as defined in RFC 3261
      [5]) a\n      transaction identifier in the branch parameter of the Via entries.\n
      \     This transaction identifier, missing in the previous SIP spec [9],\n      makes
      it unnecessary to use the SCTP stream IDs to demultiplex SIP\n      traffic.\n
      \  In many circumstances, SIP requires the use of TLS [3], for instance,\n   when
      routing a SIPS URI [5].  As defined in RFC 3436 [8], TLS running\n   over SCTP
      MUST NOT use the SCTP unordered delivery service.\n   Moreover, any SIP use
      of an extra layer between the transport layer\n   and SIP that requires ordered
      delivery of messages MUST NOT use the\n   SCTP unordered delivery service.\n
      \  SIP applications that require ordered delivery of messages from the\n   transport
      layer (e.g., TLS) SHOULD send SIP messages belonging to the\n   same SIP transaction
      over the same SCTP stream.  Additionally, they\n   SHOULD send messages belonging
      to different SIP transactions over\n   different SCTP streams, as long as there
      are enough available\n   streams.\n      A common scenario where the above mechanism
      should be used\n      consists of two proxies exchanging SIP traffic over a
      TLS\n      connection using SCTP as the transport protocol.  This works\n      because
      all of the SIP transactions between the two proxies can be\n      established
      within one SCTP association.\n   Note that if both sides of the association
      follow this\n   recommendation, when a request arrives over a particular stream,
      the\n   server is free to return responses over a different stream.  This\n
      \  way, both sides manage the available streams in the sending\n   direction,
      independently of the streams chosen by the other side to\n   send a particular
      SIP message.  This avoids undesirable collisions\n   when seizing a particular
      stream.\n"

  - "6.  Locating a SIP Server\n   The primary issue when sending a request is determining
    whether the\n   next hop server supports SCTP so that an association can be opened.\n
    \  SIP entities follow normal SIP procedures to discover [6] a server\n   that
    supports SCTP.\n   However, in order to use TLS on top of SCTP, an extra definition
    is\n   needed.  RFC 3263 defines the NAPTR (Naming Authority Pointer) [7]\n   service
    value \"SIP+D2S\" for SCTP, but fails to define a value for TLS\n   over SCTP.
    \ Here we define the NAPTR service value \"SIPS+D2S\" for\n   servers that support
    TLS over SCTP [8].\n"

    over SCTP [8]\n   is used where TLS would be required in RFC 3261 [5] or in RFC
    3263\n   [6].  So, the mechanisms described in RFC 3436 [8] MUST be used when\n
