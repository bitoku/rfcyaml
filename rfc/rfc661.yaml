  - "                          Protocol Information\n   This file contains information\
    \ on the various protocols in the ARPA\n   Network.  An effort will be made to\
    \ keep the information current, but\n   this depends on the cooperation of the\
    \ users of this file to convey\n   any information about protocol developments,\
    \ or corrections to this\n   information to Jon Postel at SRI-ARC.\n   This is\
    \ a compendium of all the protocol related activity and most of\n   this activity\
    \ is with experimental protocols, for those protocols,\n   which are official\
    \ standards the designation \"[Official]\" will be\n   appended to the name.\n\
    \   Much of the documentation of protocols appears as Requests for\n   Comments\
    \ (RFCs) and many of these are available online.  When a\n   document is accessible\
    \ online, a pointer to that source will be\n   given.  Also note that recent RFCs\
    \ are online at Office-1 in\n   directory <NETINFO> with names of the form RFCnnn.TXT\
    \ where nnn is\n   replaced by the RFC number.\n   This file is online as:\n \

  - "NATIONAL SOFTWARE WORKS\n   The National Software Works is developing a set of\
    \ protocols for its\n   use of the ARPA Network, other uses of these protocols\
    \ is encouraged.\n   The procedure call protocol is intended to facilitate the\
    \ sharing of\n   resources in the network at the subroutine level.  The procedure\
    \ call\n   protocol will be used to split nls into a front end and back end\n\
    \   components.  Procedure call protocol is also to be used in the nsw as\n  \
    \ the basis for communication between the works manager, the tool\n   bearing\
    \ hosts, and front desk procedure packages.\n   The documents cited below give\
    \ a view of the Procedure Call Protocol\n   and its use.\n      Contact:\n   \
    \      Jim White (WHITE@SRI-ARC)\n         Jon Postel (POSTEL@SIR-ARC)\n     \
    \ Documents:\n         These documents are the second published version of the\n\
    \         Procedure Call Protocol and NSW protocol - PCP/NSW Version 2.\n    \
    \     Version 2 is SUBSTANTIALLY different than Version 1; it and all\n      \
    \   intermediate, informally distributed PCP/NSW documents are\n         obsoleted\
    \ by this release.\n         The first document, PCP, is the place the interested\
    \ ready\n         should start.  It gives the required motivation for the use\n\
    \         Protocol and states the substance of the Protocol proper.  The\n   \
    \      ready may then, if he chooses, read the next three documents:\n       \
    \  PIP, PSP, and PMP.  The latter has the most to offer the casual\n         reader;\
    \ the programmer faced with coding in the PCP environment\n         should ready\
    \ all three.  The next three documents - PCPFMT,\n         PCPHST, and PCPFRK\
    \ - are of interest only to the PCP\n         implementer.  The next document\
    \ - HOST - is a preliminary\n         thought about how the NSW might use the\
    \ standard HOST-HOST\n         protocol NCP.  The last four documents - EXEC,\
    \ FILE, BATCH, and\n         LLDBUG - describe procedure packages needed to carry\
    \ out NSW\n         functions, but such packages may well be useful in other\n\
    \         contexts.\n         Version 2 consists of the following documents. \
    \ Each is\n         available online in two forms: as an NLS file and as a\n \
    \        formatted text file.  The journal number (e.g., 24459) refers\n     \
    \    to the former, of course and the pathname (e.g., [SRI-ARI]\n         <NLS>\
    \ PCP.TXT) to the latter, accessible via FTP using\n         USER=ANONYMOUS and\
    \ PASSWORD=GUEST (no account required).\n         Hardcopy is being forwarded\
    \ by US Mail to all those who have\n         expressed an interest in PCP.  If\
    \ you don't receive a copy and\n         would like one of this and/or future\
    \ releases, send a note to\n         that effect to WHITE@SRI-ARC:\n         \
