  - "1.0 Introduction\n   The IESG has requested that the Seamoby Working Group develop\
    \ a\n   problem statement about the need for additional protocol work to\n   support\
    \ alerting of dormant mode mobile hosts, commonly known as IP\n   paging, for\
    \ seamless IP mobility.  The paging design team interpreted\n   this as direction\
    \ to examine whether location of a mobile node in\n   power saving mode can be\
    \ supported by the existing Mobile IPv4 and\n   Mobile IPv6 protocols given existing\
    \ radio link protocols.\n   Many existing radio link protocols and mobile systems\
    \ support\n   location of and radio link establishment with mobile nodes that\
    \ are\n   in power saving mode and hence are not actively listening for\n   delivery\
    \ of IP packets all the time or are not listening on the radio\n   channels normally\
    \ associated with delivering IP traffic to mobile\n   nodes.  This alerting functionality\
    \ allows mobile nodes to reduce\n   power consumption and decreases signaling\
    \ load on the network for\n   tracking mobiles that are not actively participating\
    \ in IP packet\n   generation or reception.\n   When a mobile is in low power\
    \ consumption mode, special steps need to\n   be taken to locate the mobile and\
    \ alert it.  These steps differ\n   depending on the radio link, but the generic\
    \ name for this process is\n   paging, a term that is commonly used in cellular\
    \ telephony.\n   In this document, after some initial definitions and material\
    \ related\n   to more clearly explaining what paging is, we assess the need for\n\
    \   paging in existing IP mobility protocols (namely Mobile IP [1] [2]).\n   We\
    \ then develop a list of work items for the Seamoby working group\n   related\
    \ to this need.  Note that the discussion in this document and\n   the conclusions\
    \ regarding work items are directed toward existing IP\n   mobility protocols\
    \ and existing radio link protocols.  Should a major\n   change occur in radio\
    \ link support or the available IP mobility\n   protocols, such as the introduction\
    \ of a micromobility protocol for\n   IP, the issues examined in this document\
    \ may need to be revisited.\n"
- title: 2.0 Definitions
  contents:
  - "2.0 Definitions\n   The following definitions are relevant with respect to clarifying\
    \ the\n   paging functionality:\n      Dormant Mode - A state in which the mobile\
    \ restricts its ability\n      to receive normal IP traffic by reducing monitoring\
    \ of radio\n      channels.  This allows the mobile to save power and reduces\n\
    \      signaling load on the network.\n      Time-slotted Dormant Mode - A dormant\
    \ mode implementation in which\n      the mobile alternates between periods of\
    \ not listening for any\n      radio traffic and listening for traffic.  Time-slotted\
    \ dormant\n      mode implementations are typically synchronized with the network\n\
    \      so the network can deliver traffic to the mobile during listening\n   \
    \   periods.  Additionally, the mobile may be restricted to listening\n      on\
    \ specific signaling channels that, according to current\n      practice, are\
    \ not typically used to carry IP traffic.\n      Paging - As a consequence of\
    \ a mobile-bound packet destined for a\n      mobile currently in dormant mode,\
    \ signaling by the network through\n      radio access points directed to locating\
    \ the mobile and alerting\n      it to establish a last hop connection.  This\
    \ messaging is in\n      addition to simply delivering the packet to the mobile,\
    \ i.e., last\n      hop routing of packets is NOT considered to be paging.\n \
    \     Paging Area - Collection of radio access points that are signaled\n    \
    \  to locate a dormant mode mobile node.  A paging area does not\n      necessarily\
    \ correspond to an IP subnet.  A dormant mode mobile\n      node may be required\
    \ to signal to the network when it crosses a\n      paging area boundary, in order\
    \ that the network can maintain a\n      rough idea of where the mobile is located.\n\
    \      Paging Channel - A radio channel dedicated to signaling dormant\n     \
    \ mode mobiles for paging purposes.  By current practice, the\n      protocol\
    \ used on a paging channel is usually dictated by the radio\n      link protocol,\
    \ although some paging protocols have provision for\n      carrying arbitrary\
    \ traffic (and thus could potentially be used to\n      carry IP).\n      Traffic\
    \ Channel - The radio channel on which IP traffic to an\n      active mobile is\
    \ typically sent.  This channel is used by a mobile\n      that is actively sending\
    \ and receiving IP traffic, and is not\n      continuously active in a dormant\
    \ mode mobile.  For some radio link\n      protocols, this may be the only channel\
    \ available.\n      Paging Area Registrations - Signaling from a dormant mode\
    \ mobile\n      node to the network when the mobile node crosses a paging area\n\
    \      boundary to establish the mobile node's presence in the new paging\n  \
    \    area.\n"
- title: 3.0 Discussion of Paging
  contents:
  - "3.0 Discussion of Paging\n   Dormant mode is advantageous to a mobile node and\
    \ the network for the\n   following reasons:\n      - Power savings.  By reducing\
    \ the amount of time the mobile is\n      required to listen to the radio interface,\
    \ the drain on the mobile\n      node's battery is reduced.\n      - Reduced signaling\
    \ for location tracking.  By requiring the\n      mobile to only signal when it\
    \ crosses a paging area boundary\n      rather than when it switches between radio\
    \ access points, the\n      amount of signaling for tracking the mobile is reduced\
    \ because\n      paging areas typically contain many radio access points.\n  \
    \ In existing radio link protocols, there is a clear distinction\n   between those\
    \ protocols that support dormant mode only and those that\n   support dormant\
    \ mode with paging.  Radio link protocols that do not\n   support paging have\
    \ no paging areas, no dedicated paging channel, and\n   no radio link protocol\
    \ specifically directed towards locating a\n   dormant mode mobile, while radio\
    \ link protocols that do support\n   paging have these features.  Although generalizations\
    \ always run the\n   risk of being contradicted by specific exceptions, the following\n\
    \   comparison of existing radio link protocol support for these two\n   cases\
    \ may be instructive.\n"
- title: 3.1 Dormant Mode Support Only
  contents:
  - "3.1 Dormant Mode Support Only\n   In radio link protocols that only support dormant\
    \ mode, a dormant\n   mode mobile node typically operates in time slotted mode\
    \ and there is\n   only one radio channel available, namely the traffic channel.\
    \  The\n   mobile node periodically wakes up, and, synchronously, the radio\n\
    \   access point in the network with which the mobile node is associated\n   delivers\
    \ any IP packets that have arrived while the mobile node was\n   asleep.  Radio\
    \ access points are required to buffer incoming packets\n   for dormant mode mobiles;\
    \ exactly how many packets and how long they\n   are buffered are implementation\
    \ dependent.\n   If the mobile node happens to move out of range of the access\
    \ point\n   with which it was associated, while it is in dormant mode, it\n  \
    \ discovers this when it awakens and reassociates with a new access\n   point.\
    \  The new access point then contacts the old access point over\n   the wired\
    \ backbone, the old access point sends any buffered packets,\n   and the new access\
    \ point delivers them to the mobile.\n   Radio link protocols with dormant mode\
    \ support only are typically\n   wireless LAN protocols in unlicensed spectrum\
    \ in which the mobile\n   node is not charged for using a traffic channel, and\
    \ hence there is\n   no need for conserving spectrum usage.\n"
- title: 3.2 Dormant Mode with Paging Support
  contents:
  - "3.2 Dormant Mode with Paging Support\n   In radio link protocols with support\
    \ for paging, the radio link\n   typically supports more than one channel.  A\
    \ dormant mode mobile node\n   may operate in time slotted mode, periodically\
    \ waking up to listen to\n   the paging channel, or it may simply listen to the\
    \ paging channel\n   continuously.  The important point is that the mobile does\
    \ not listen\n   to nor transmit on a traffic channel while in dormant mode.\n\
    \   The radio access points are grouped into paging areas, and the radio\n   link\
    \ protocol supports periodic signaling between the mobile and the\n   network\
    \ only when the mobile crosses a paging area boundary, for the\n   purpose of\
    \ giving the network a rough idea of the mobile's location\n   (paging area registrations).\
    \  Some deployments of paging do not even\n   use paging area registrations. \
    \ They use heuristics to determine\n   where the mobile is located when a packet\
    \ arrives, in which case, no\n   signaling is required while the mobile is in\
    \ dormant mode.\n   An incoming packet is directed to the paging area where the\
    \ mobile\n   last reported, or the paging area is determined by heuristics.  The\n\
    \   network performs a radio link page by sending out a signal on the\n   paging\
    \ channel.  The signal may be repeated until the mobile answers\n   or a timeout\
    \ occurs.  In the former case, the packet is delivered, in\n   the latter, the\
    \ mobile is assumed to be unreachable.\n   Radio link protocols with paging support\
    \ tend to be in licensed\n   spectrum where the network operator has an interest\
    \ in reducing the\n   amount of signaling over traffic channels.  Such reduction\
    \ frees\n   traffic channel spectrum for revenue-producing use, and avoids\n \
    \  charging the customer for signaling overhead.\n"

  - "4.0 Is IP Paging Necessary?\n   In this section, we consider whether IP paging\
    \ support is necessary.\n   We first consider radio link protocols that have no\

    \ existing IETF mobility protocol, namely Mobile IP, requires\n   enhancement.\
    \  We also briefly discuss the relationship between paging\n   and a potential\
    \ future micromobility protocol.\n"
- title: 4.1 IP Paging for Dormant Mode Only Radio Links
  contents:
  - "4.1 IP Paging for Dormant Mode Only Radio Links\n   One possible justification\
    \ for IP paging is for radio links that do\n   not support paging.  The reasoning\
    \ is that an IP paging protocol\n   could allow location of a dormant mode mobile\
    \ in radio networks that\n   do not support paging in the radio protocol.\n  \
    \ An important point to keep in mind when considering this possibility\n   is\
    \ that, for radio links that do support paging, paging is typically\n   used to\
    \ locate mobiles for which the network has a rough idea of\n   where the mobile\
    \ is located.  More specifically, in order to conserve\n   signaling between the\
    \ network and the mobile and to reduce power\n   drain on the mobile, the mobile\
    \ only updates the network about its\n   location when it crosses a paging area\
    \ boundary (if even then), which\n   is far less frequent than when it crosses\
    \ a radio access point\n   boundary.  If IP paging is to be of any use to radio\
    \ link protocols\n   that do not support paging, it must also be the case that\
    \ it allows\n   the network to maintain a rough idea of where the mobile is,\n\
    \   otherwise, the amount of signaling involved in tracking the mobile\n   and\
    \ power drain on the mobile is not reduced.\n   However, as the description in\
    \ the previous section indicates, for\n   radio links without paging support,\
    \ the network always has an *exact*\n   idea of where the mobile is located. \
    \ When the mobile moves into\n   range of a new radio access point, it re-registers\
    \ with the access\n   point in that cell allowing the new access point to contact\
    \ the old\n   and deliver any buffered traffic.  Additionally, the new access\
    \ point\n   at that time may choose to deliver a foreign agent advertisement (for\n\
    \   Mobile IPv4) or router advertisement (for Mobile IPv6) to the mobile\n   if\
    \ the mobile node has changed subnets, so that the mobile can\n   perform Mobile\
    \ IP re-registration in order to make sure its IP\n   routing is current.  There\
    \ is absolutely no ambiguity in the mobile's\n   location as far as the network\
    \ is concerned, and so the network can\n   continue to route packets to the mobile\
    \ node while the mobile is in\n   dormant mode with assurance (modulo buffer overflows\
    \ and timeouts at\n   the radio access point) that the packets will be delivered\
    \ to the\n   mobile the next time it wakes up from dormant mode.\n   As a consequence,\
    \ IP paging provides no advantages for radio link\n   protocols in which the radio\
    \ link does not have support for paging.\n"
- title: 4.2 IP Paging for Radio Links with Paging Support
  contents:
  - "4.2 IP Paging for Radio Links with Paging Support\n   In radio links that do\
    \ support paging, there are two cases to\n   consider: networks of radio links\
    \ having a homogeneous radio\n   technology and networks of radio links having\
    \ heterogeneous radio\n   technologies.  We examine whether Mobile IP can support\
    \ dormant mode\n   location for both these cases.\n"
- title: 4.2.1 Homogeneous Technology Networks
  contents:
  - "4.2.1 Homogeneous Technology Networks\n   For homogeneous technology networks,\
    \ the primary issue is whether\n   signaling involved in Mobile IP is enough to\
    \ provide support for\n   locating dormant mode mobile nodes.  Subnets constitute\
    \ the unit of\n   signaling for presence in IP.  When a mobile node moves from\
    \ one\n   subnet to another, Mobile IP signaling is required to change the\n \
    \  mobile's care-of address.  This signaling establishes the mobile's\n   presence\
    \ in the new subnet.  Paging areas constitute the unit of\n   signaling for dormant\
    \ mode mobile presence at the radio level.\n   Paging area registrations or heuristics\
    \ are used to establish a\n   dormant mode mobile's presence in a particular paging\
    \ area.\n   If paging area registrations can always serve to trigger Mobile IP\n\
    \   registrations, there is no need for an IP paging protocol because the\n  \
    \ network (specifically the home or hierarchical agent) will always\n   have an\
    \ up-to-date picture of where the mobile is and can always\n   route packets to\
    \ the mobile.  The key determining factor with regard\n   to whether paging area\
    \ registrations can be used in this fashion is\n   how subnets are mapped into\
    \ paging areas.  If it is always possible\n   to map the two such that a paging\
    \ area registration can serve as a\n   transport for a Mobile IP registration,\
    \ or some other technique (such\n   as network assisted handoff [3] [4]) can be\
    \ used to transfer the\n   Mobile IP registration, then no IP paging protocol\
    \ is needed.\n   In general, the mapping between paging areas and subnets can\
    \ be\n   arbitrary, but we consider initially a smooth subset relationship, in\n\
    \   which paging areas are subsets of subnets or vice versa.  Network\n   topologies\
    \ in which one subnet is split between two or more paging\n   areas are therefore\
    \ eliminated.  The restriction is arbitrary, but by\n   starting here, we can\
    \ discover whether additional work is needed.  We\n   also consider a case where\
    \ paging area registrations in the radio\n   layer protocol are always done. \
    \ This is also optimistic.\n   There are three cases:\n      1) The topological\
    \ boundaries of the paging area and subnet are\n         identical.\n      2)\
    \ Multiple paging areas are part of the same subnet.\n      3) Multiple subnets\
    \ are part of the same paging area.\n      Each case is considered in the following\
    \ subsections.\n"
- title: 4.2.1.1 Subnet and Paging Area Boundaries Identical
  contents:
  - "4.2.1.1 Subnet and Paging Area Boundaries Identical\n   In the case where radio\
    \ paging areas map one to one onto IP subnets\n   (and hence Mobile IPv4 foreign\
    \ agents or IPv6 access routers), it is\n   possible to use radio link paging\
    \ together with Mobile IP handoff\n   techniques for the network to track the\
    \ mobile's location.  If the\n   paging area update protocol supports sending\
    \ arbitrary packet data\n   over the paging channel, the access router or foreign\
    \ agent can send\n   a router advertisement or foreign agent advertisement to\
    \ the mobile\n   as part of the signal that the mobile has entered the new paging\n\
    \   area, and the mobile can send a Mobile IP registration as part of the\n  \

    \ router for the subnet performs\n   paging in multiple paging areas to locate\
    \ the mobile.\n"
- title: 4.2.1.3 Multiple Subnets Map into One Paging Area
  contents:
  - "4.2.1.3 Multiple Subnets Map into One Paging Area\n   In the case where a single\
    \ radio paging area maps onto multiple IP\n   subnets, it is not possible to directly\
    \ use Mobile IP handoff between\n   last hop access routers or foreign agents\
    \ to track the mobile's\n   location as it moves, because the mobile does not\
    \ signal its location\n   when it changes subnets.  Within the set of subnets\
    \ that span the\n   paging area, the mobile's movement is invisible to the L2\
    \ paging\n   system, so a packet delivered to the mobile's last known location\
    \ may\n   result in a page that is answered in a different subnet.\n   Consider\
    \ the following example.  Suppose we have a network in which\n   there are two\
    \ paging areas, PA(1) and PA(2).  Within each, there are\n   many subnets.  Consider\
    \ a mobile that moves from PA(1) to PA(2), and\n   enters PA(2) at subnet X. \
    \ Using the paging area registration, it\n   signals the network that it has moved,\
    \ and suppose that the paging\n   area registration contains a Mobile IP registration.\
    \  The agent\n   handling the L2 paging protocol sends the registration to the\n\
    \   home/hierarchical agent (or perhaps it simply gets routed).  The\n   home/hierarchical\
    \ agent now knows that the mobile has a CoA in subnet\n   X, as does the mobile.\
    \  After the mobile has completed the paging\n   area registration/Mobile IP registration,\
    \ it goes back to sleep.\n   But the mobile does not stop in subnet X, it keeps\
    \ moving while in\n   dormant mode, when it is doing no signaling (L2, mobile\
    \ IP or other)\n   to the network.  It moves from subnet X where it originally\
    \ entered\n   the paging area clear to the other side of the paging area, in a\n\
    \   completely different subnet, subnet Y.\n   Suppose a packet comes into the\
    \ home/hierarchical agent for this\n   mobile.  Because the home/hierarchical\
    \ agent believes the mobile is\n   in subnet X, it sends the packet to the access\
    \ router or foreign\n   agent for subnet X.  The packet gets to the access router\
    \ or foreign\n   agent, and the access router or foreign agent performs a radio\
    \ page\n   for the mobile in subnet X.  Since the mobile isn't in subnet X, it\n\
    \   wakes up in subnet Y because the radio page propagates throughout the\n  \
    \ paging area.  It does a mobile IP re-registration because it sees\n   that it\
    \ is in a new subnet, but the packet at the access router or\n   foreign agent\
    \ in subnet X can't get to the mobile.\n   Without any further support, the access\
    \ router or foreign agent in\n   subnet X drops the packet.  The only way to get\
    \ the packet to the\n   mobile node from the access router or foreign agent is\
    \ for the mobile\n   node to send a binding update to the access router or foreign\
    \ agent\n   when it wakes up in the new subnet.  Once the access router or\n \
    \  foreign agent has the new binding, it can forward the packet.  Some\n   smooth\
    \ handoff techniques depend on sending binding updates to\n   foreign agents [5],\
    \ so arranging for the mobile node to send a\n   binding update would be possible.\
    \  In IPv6, it becomes less\n   attractive because of the need for security on\
    \ the binding update.\n   In either case, the result would be yet more Mobile\
    \ IP signaling\n   before the packet could be delivered, increasing the amount\
    \ of\n   latency experienced by the mobile.\n   While it may be possible with\
    \ enhancements to Mobile IP to handle the\n   case, the enhancements would probably\
    \ introduce more latency and\n   signaling into the initial connection between\
    \ the mobile and the\n   network when the mobile awakes from dormant mode.  An\
    \ IP paging\n   protocol between the home or hierarchical agent and a paging agent\
    \ in\n   the paging area would serve to reduce the amount of latency involved\n\
    \   in delivering the initial packet.  With IP paging, the arrival of the\n  \
    \ packet at the home/hierarchical agent results in an IP page to a\n   paging\
    \ agent in the last reported paging area.  The paging agent\n   performs an L2\
    \ page to the mobile.  The mobile answers the page with\n   a mobile IP registration\
    \ to the home/hierarchical agent and the\n   home/hierarchical agent sends the\
    \ packet.  The home/hierarchical\n   agent and the mobile already have a security\
    \ association, so there is\n   no need to negotiate one, and buffering of the\
    \ first packet and any\n   further incoming packets prior to the mobile IP registration\
    \ is\n   handled by the home/hierarchical agent rather than a router at the\n\
    \   edge, so the edge routers can be simpler.  Finally, the\n   home/hierarchical\
    \ agent can start routing to the mobile as soon as\n   the registration comes\
    \ in.\n"

  contents:
  - "4.1.2.4 More Complex Homogeneous Network Cases\n   Up until now, the discussion\
    \ has not identified any case where the\n   problem of locating and delivering\
    \ the first packet to a dormant mode\n   mobile could not be handled by Mobile\
    \ IP with enhancements.  IP\n   paging serves as a promising optimization in the\
    \ multiple subnets to\n   single paging area case, but in principle additional\
    \ Mobile IP\n   signaling (potentially lots in the case of IPv6 if a security\n\
    \   association is needed) could handle the problem.  However, the\n   examples\
    \ examined in the above sections are really best-case.  In\n   practice, the mapping\
    \ of subnets to paging areas is likely to be far\n   less clear cut, and the use\
    \ of paging area registrations far less\n   common than has been assumed in these\
    \ cases.\n   Requiring network operators to make paging areas and subnets conform\n\
    \   to a subset relationship that would allow mobile IP signaling to do\n   double\
    \ duty as paging area updates is unrealistic.  In practice,\n   paging areas often\

    \ paging area identifiers.  Working\n   through each case and trying to identify\
    \ whether Mobile IP needs\n   enhancement would probably result in a much more\
    \ complex result than\n   having a simple IP paging protocol that allows a home/hierarchical\n\
    \   agent to notify an L2 agent in the paging area when a new packet\n   comes\
    \ in.\n   Finally, requiring operators to always turn on paging area\n   registrations\
    \ is unacceptable, and using Mobile IP registrations\n   won't work if paging\
    \ area registrations are not done.  The above\n   description is ideal with regard\
    \ to signaling between the mobile node\n   in dormant mode and the network.  Anecdotal\
    \ evidence indicates that\n   most operators do not turn on paging area registrations,\
    \ they use\n   heuristics to determine where to page for the mobile.  If the\n\
    \   operator does not turn on paging area registrations, there is no way\n   for\
    \ the mobile to report its position when it changes paging area,\n   hence no\
    \ L2 vehicle for potential dormant mode use of Mobile IP.\n"

  - "4.2.2 Heterogeneous Technology Networks\n   In a network composed of links with\
    \ multiple technologies, the\n   problems identified above become multiplied.\
    \  Using Mobile IP becomes\n   even more cumbersome, because the subnet to which\
    \ the initial packet\n   is delivered, besides not being in the same subnet on\
    \ which the\n   dormant mode mobile is located, may be on a radio network which\
    \ the\n   user would actually not prefer to use in their current location.\n \
    \  This could happen, for example, if the mobile moved inside a building\n   and\
    \ radio coverage on one interface became weak or nonexistent, or if\n   the user\
    \ had a choice of a cheaper or higher bandwidth connection.\n   The mobile may\
    \ actually no longer be listening or reachable on the\n   paging channel of the\
    \ old network, so when the old access router or\n   foreign agent pages on the\
    \ old radio network, the mobile, which is\n   now listening only for pages on\
    \ the new network, may not answer, even\n   though it is reachable on the new\
    \ network.  Arranging for pages in\n   multiple radio networks is a possibility,\
    \ but without an L3 paging\n   protocol to abstract away from the L2 details,\
    \ the details of each L2\n   protocol must be handled separately.\n   A paging\
    \ protocol that unifies paging across multiple radio\n   technologies therefore\
    \ looks attractive.  There may be commonalities\n   in the corresponding radio\
    \ paging protocols that allow a mapping to\n   be established between the radio\
    \ protocols and an abstract IP paging\n   protocol.  For example, assume we have\
    \ a common paging area\n   identifier defined at the IP layer that is mapped to\
    \ each radio\n   paging protocol by the access points.  An IP paging message\n\
    \   containing the identifier is sent to multiple access points, where\n   the\
    \ appropriate radio paging message is sent based on the particular\n   technology\
    \ implemented by the access points.  The results are then\n   returned by the\
    \ radio paging responses, mapped back into IP by the\n   access points, and delivered\
    \ back to the origin of the page.\n   An additional case to consider is when a\
    \ single subnet consists of\n   multiple radio access technologies.  A wireless\
    \ access point usually\n   provides L2 bridge behavior to the wired link with\
    \ which it is\n   connected.  If two access points with incompatible technologies\
    \ and\n   non-overlapping cells are connected to the same subnet, a mobile node\n\
    \   with interfaces to both technologies would need paging from both\n   technologies.\
    \  If reachability can be established simply by ARP or\n   neighbor discovery,\
    \ no IP paging is needed.  However, note that ARP\n   or neighbor discovery requires\
    \ that a functional traffic channel be\n   available to the mobile, since these\
    \ protocols are typically\n   implemented for wired networks in which a single\
    \ channel exists on\n   which all IP traffic is delivered.  If the mobile is currently\
    \ in the\n   sleep phase of a time-slotted dormant mode, or if it is listening\
    \ to\n   a paging channel it will fail to respond to these requests.  In this\n\
    \   case, some means of triggering a radio page from IP is necessary to\n   find\
    \ the mobile.  Modifying ARP or neighbor discovery to utilize a\n   paging channel\
    \ if available is a possible, if somewhat messy,\n   alternative, but a dedicated\
    \ location protocol may be somewhat\n   cleaner.\n"

  - "4.3 Paging and Micromobility\n   If the Seamoby Working Group decides that an\
    \ IP micromobility\n   protocol is necessary, then the above analysis is no longer\
    \ complete.\n   A micromobility protocol may require some type of paging support.\n\
    \   The design team does not want to include any further discussion of\n   paging\
    \ and micromobility at this point, because it is not clear\n   whether micromobility\

  - "5.0 What Exactly is the Problem?\n   While the above analysis has identified\
    \ situations in which location\n   of a mobile in dormant mode may require some\
    \ action at the IP layer,\n   it is important keep in mind what the problem is.\
    \  The problem to be\n   solved is the location of a mobile node because it has\
    \ moved while in\n   dormant mode.  IP paging is one solution to the problem,\
    \ there may be\n   others.\n"
- title: 6.0 Recommendations
  contents:
  - "6.0 Recommendations\n   The design group recommends the following charter items\
    \ for Seamboy:\n      1) Since the design group has identified several network\n\
    \         deployment scenarios where existing Mobile IP technology cannot\n  \
    \       find a mobile in dormant mode, protocol work is necessary to\n       \
    \  define a way for the network to find a mobile that is currently\n         in\
    \ dormant mode.\n      2) The work defined above should be pursued in a way that\
    \ is\n         maximally consistent with Mobile IP and other existing IETF\n \
    \        protocols.  The work should also generate recommendations about\n   \
    \      how to achieve the best match between existing radio paging\n         protocols\
    \ and IP.\n      3) If the Seamoby working group decides to pursue a micromobility\n\
    \         protocol that requires paging, the Seamoby group should\n         undertake\
    \ the design of a new paging protocol within the\n         context of that work.\n\
    \      4) There is some evidence that cellular operators' deployments of\n   \
    \      paging are highly variable, and may, in fact, be suboptimal in\n      \
    \   many cases with respect to supporting IP.  The Seamoby working\n         group\
    \ should write a BCP which explains how to perform IP\n         subnet to paging\
    \ area mapping and which techniques to use when,\n         so network designers\
    \ in wireless networks have a guide when\n         they are setting up their networks.\n"
