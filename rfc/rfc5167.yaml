  - "1.  Introduction\n   The IETF conferencing framework in RFC 4353 [CARCH] presents\
    \ an\n   architecture that is built of several functional entities.  RFC 4353\n\
    \   [CARCH] does not specify the protocols between the functional\n   entities\
    \ since it is considered out of scope.\n   Based on RFC 4353 [CARCH], this document\
    \ defines the requirements for\n   a protocol that will enable one functional\
    \ entity, known as an\n   Application Server (AS), that includes the conference/media\
    \ policy\n   server, the notification server, and the focus, all defined in RFC\n\
    \   4353 [CARCH], to interact with one or more functional entities,\n   called\
    \ Media Server (MS), that serves as mixer or media server.\n   The media server\
    \ can also be used for announcements and Interactive\n   Voice Response (IVR)\
    \ functions.\n   Application servers host one or more instances of a communication\n\
    \   application.  Media servers provide real time media processing\n   functions.\
    \  An example of the decomposition of a media server and an\n   application server\
    \ is described in the media control framework\n   document [MEDIACTRL-FW].\n \
    \  This document presents the requirements for a Media Server Control\n   Protocol\
    \ (MCP) that enables an application server to control a media\n   server.  It\
    \ will address the aspects of announcements, IVR, and\n   conferencing media services.\n\
    \   The requirements are for the protocol and do not address the AS or MS\n  \
    \ functionality discussed in the media control framework.\n   Since the media\
    \ server is a centralized component, the charter of the\n   working group states\
    \ that this work will not investigate distributed\n   media processing algorithms\
    \ or control protocols.\n"
- title: 2.  Terminology
  contents:
  - "2.  Terminology\n   The media server work uses, when appropriate, and expands\
    \ on the\n   terminology introduced in the conferencing framework [CARCH] and\n\
    \   Centralized Conferencing (XCON) framework [XCON-FRMWRK].  The\n   following\
    \ additional terms are defined:\n   Application Server (AS) - A functional entity\
    \ that hosts one or more\n   instances of a communication application.  The application\
    \ server may\n   include the conference policy server, the focus, and the conference\n\
    \   notification server, as defined in [CARCH].  Also, it may include\n   communication\
    \ applications that use IVR or announcement services.\n   Media Server (MS) -\
    \ The media server includes the mixer as defined in\n   [CARCH].  The media server\
    \ plays announcements, it processes media\n   streams for functions like Dual\
    \ Tone Multi-Frequency (DTMF) detection\n   and transcoding.  The media server\
    \ may also record media streams for\n   supporting IVR functions like announcing\
    \ participants\n   Media Resource Broker (MRB) - A logical entity that is responsible\n\
    \   for both the collection of appropriate published Media Server (MS)\n   information\
    \ and supplying of appropriate MS information to consuming\n   entities.  The\
    \ MRB is an optional entity and will be discussed in a\n   separate document.\n\
    \   Notification - A notification is used when there is a need to report\n   event-related\
    \ information from the MS to the AS.\n   Request - A request is sent from the\
    \ controlling entity, such as an\n   application server, to another resource,\
    \ such as a media server,\n   asking that a particular type of operation be executed.\n\
    \   Response - A response is used to signal information, such as an\n   acknowledgement\
    \ or error code in reply to a previously issued\n   request.\n"

- title: 3.1.  Media Control Requirements
  contents:
  - "3.1.  Media Control Requirements\n   The following are the media control requirements:\n\
    \   REQ-MCP-01 -  The MS Control Protocol shall enable one or more\n      application\
    \ servers to request media services from one or more\n      media servers.\n \
    \  REQ-MCP-02 -   The MS Control Protocol shall use a reliable transport\n   \
    \   protocol.\n   REQ-MCP-03 -  The applications supported by the protocol shall\n\
    \      include conferencing and Interactive Voice Response media\n      services.\n\
    \   Note: Though the protocol enables these services, the functionality\n   is\
    \ invoked through other mechanisms.\n   REQ-MCP-04 -  Media types supported in\
    \ the context of the\n      applications shall include audio, tones, text, and\
    \ video.  Tones\n      media include in-band audio or RFC 4733 payload.\n   REQ-MCP-05\
    \ -  The MS control protocol should allow, but must not\n      require, a media\
    \ resource broker (MRB) or intermediate proxy to\n      exist with the application\
    \ server and media server.\n   REQ-MCP-06 -  On the MS control channel, there\
    \ shall be requests to\n      the MS, responses from the MS, and notifications\
    \ to the AS.\n   REQ-MCP-07 -  SIP/SDP (Session Initiation Protocol / Session\n\
    \      Description Protocol) shall be used to establish and modify media\n   \
    \   connections to a media server.\n   REQ-MCP-08 -  It should be possible to\
    \ support a single conference\n      spanning multiple media servers.\n      Note:\
    \ It is probable that spanning multiple MSs can be\n      accomplished by the\
    \ AS and does not require anything in the\n      protocol for the scenarios we\
    \ have in mind.  However, the concern\n      is that if this requirement is treated\
    \ too lightly, one may end up\n      with a protocol that precludes its support.\n\
    \   REQ-MCP-09 -  It must be possible to split call legs individually, or\n  \
    \    in groups, away from a main conference on a given media server,\n      without\
    \ performing re-establishment of the call legs to the MS\n      (e.g., for purposes\
    \ such as performing IVR with a single call leg\n      or creating sub-conferences,\
    \ not for creating entirely new\n      conferences).\n   REQ-MCP-10 -  The MS\
    \ control protocol should be extendable,\n      facilitating forward and backward\
    \ compatibility.\n   REQ-MCP-11 -  The MS control protocol shall include an authentication\n\
    \      component to ensure that only an authorized AS can communicate\n      with\
    \ the MS, and vice versa.\n   REQ-MCP-12 -  The MS control protocol shall use\
    \ some form of\n      transport protection to ensure the confidentiality and integrity\n\
    \      of the data between the AS and MS.\n   REQ-MCP-13 -  Different application\
    \ servers may have different\n      privileges for using an MS.  The protocol\
    \ should prevent the AS\n      from doing unauthorized operations on a MS.\n \
    \  REQ-MCP-14 -  The MS control protocol requires mechanisms to protect\n    \
    \  the MS resources used by one AS from another AS since the solution\n      needs\
    \ to support multiple ASs controlling one MS.\n   REQ-MCP-15 -  During session\
    \ establishment, there shall be a\n      capability to negotiate parameters that\
    \ are associated with media\n      streams.  This requirement should also enable\
    \ an AS managing\n      conference to specify the media streams allowed in the\
    \ conference.\n   REQ-MCP-16 -  The AS shall be able to instruct the MS to perform\n\
    \      stream operations like mute and gain control.\n   REQ-MCP-17 -  The AS\
    \ shall be able to instruct the MS to play a\n      specific announcement.\n \
    \  REQ-MCP-18 -  The AS shall be able to request the MS to create,\n      delete,\
    \ and manipulate a mixing, IVR, or announcement session.\n   REQ-MCP-19 -  The\
    \ AS shall be able to instruct the MS to play\n      announcements to a single\
    \ user or to a conference mix.\n   REQ-MCP-20 -  The MS control protocol should\
    \ enable the AS to ask the\n      MS for a session summary report.  The report\
    \ may include resource\n      usage and quality metrics.\n   REQ-MCP-21 -  The\
    \ MS shall be able to notify the AS of events\n      received in the media stream\
    \ if requested by the AS.  (Examples -\n      STUN request, Flow Control, etc.)\n"
- title: 3.2.  Media mixing Requirements
  contents:
  - "3.2.  Media mixing Requirements\n   REQ-MCP-22 -  The AS shall be able to define\
    \ a conference mix; the MS\n      may offer different mixing topologies.  The\
    \ conference mix may be\n      defined on a conference or user level.\n   REQ-MCP-23\
    \ -  The AS may be able to define a custom video layout\n      built of rectangular\
    \ sub-windows.\n   REQ-MCP-24 -  For video, the AS shall be able to map a stream\
    \ to a\n      specific sub-window or to define to the MS how to decide which\n\
    \      stream will go to each sub-window.\n   REQ-MCP-25 -  The MS shall be able\
    \ to notify the ASs of who the\n      active sources of the media are; for example,\
    \ who the active\n      speaker is or who is being viewed in a conference.  The\
    \ speaker\n      and the video source may be different, for example, a person\n\
    \      describing a video stream from a remote camera managed by a\n      different\
    \ user.\n   REQ-MCP-26 -  The MS shall be able to inform the AS which layouts\
    \ it\n      supports.\n   REQ-MCP-27 -  The MS control protocol should enable\
    \ the AS to\n      instruct the MS to record a specific conference mix.\n"
- title: 3.3.  IVR Requirements
  contents:
  - "3.3.  IVR Requirements\n   REQ-MCP-28 -  The AS shall be able to instruct the\
    \ MS to perform one\n      or more IVR scripts and receive the results.  The script\
    \ may be in\n      a server or contained in the control message.\n   REQ-MCP-29\
    \ -  The AS shall be able to manage the IVR session by\n      sending requests\
    \ to play announcements to the MS and receiving the\n      response (e.g., DTMF).\
    \  The IVR session flow, in this case, is\n      handled by the AS by starting\
    \ a next phase based on the response\n      it receives from the MS on the current\
    \ phase.\n   REQ-MCP-30 -  The AS should be able to instruct the MS to record\
    \ a\n      short participant stream and play it back.  This is not a\n      recording\
    \ requirement.\n"
- title: 3.4.  Operational Requirements
  contents:
  - "3.4.  Operational Requirements\n   These requirements may be applicable to the\
    \ MRB, but they can be used\n   by an AS if it has a one-to-one connection to\
    \ the MS.\n   REQ-MCP-31 -  The MS control protocol must allow the AS to audit\
    \ the\n      MS state during an active session.\n   REQ-MCP-32 -  The MS shall\
    \ be able to inform the AS about its status\n      during an active session.\n"
- title: 4.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "4.  Security Considerations\n   This document discusses high-level requirements\
    \ for MCP.  The MCP has\n   some specific security requirements, which will be\
    \ summarized here at\n   a very high level.\n   All of the operations and functions\
    \ described in this document need\n   to be authorized by an MS or an AS.  It\
    \ is expected that MS resources\n   will be governed by a set of authorization\
    \ rules defined as part of\n   the AS / MS policy.  In order for the policy to\
    \ be implemented, the\n   MS needs to be able to authenticate requests.  Normal\
    \ SIP mechanisms,\n   including Digest authentication and certificates, can be\
    \ used as\n   specified in RFC 3261 [RFC3261].  These MCP security requirements\n\
    \   will be discussed in detail in the framework and protocol documents.\n"
