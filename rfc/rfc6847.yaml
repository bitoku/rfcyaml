  - "1.  Introduction\n   Data center networks are rapidly evolving towards a consolidated\n\
    \   approach, in which Ethernet is used as the common infrastructure for\n   all\
    \ types of traffic.  Storage traffic was traditionally dominated by\n   the Fibre\
    \ Channel (FC) protocol suite.  At the intersection between\n   these two technologies\
    \ a new technology was born, Fibre Channel over\n   Ethernet (FCoE), in which\
    \ native FC packets are encapsulated with an\n   FCoE encapsulation over an Ethernet\
    \ header.  FCoE is specified in\n   [FC-BB-5].  (A future version of FCoE is under\
    \ development and is\n   expected to be specified in a document to be referred\
    \ to as FC-BB-6;\n   however, this is a work in progress and is beyond the scope\
    \ of this\n   document.)\n   Traffic between two FCoE end nodes (ENodes) is forwarded\
    \ through one\n   or more FCoE Forwarders (FCFs).  An FCF takes a forwarding decision\n\
    \   based on the Fibre Channel destination ID (D_ID), and enforces\n   security\
    \ policies between ENodes, also known as zoning.  Once an FCF\n   takes a forwarding\
    \ decision, it modifies the source and destination\n   MAC addresses of the packet,\
    \ to reflect the path to the next-hop FCF\n   or ENode.  An FCoE virtual link\
    \ is an Ethernet link between an ENode\n   and an FCF, or between two FCFs.  An\
    \ FCoE virtual link may traverse\n   one or more Layer 2 bridges.  FCFs use a\
    \ routing protocol called\n   Fabric Shortest Path First (FSPF) to find the optimal\
    \ path to each\n   destination.  An FCF typically has one or more native Fibre\
    \ Channel\n   interfaces, allowing it to communicate with native Fibre Channel\n\
    \   devices, e.g., storage arrays.\n   TRILL [TRILL] is a protocol for transparent\
    \ least-cost routing, where\n   Routing Bridges (RBridges) forward traffic to\
    \ their destination based\n   on a least-cost route, using a TRILL encapsulation\
    \ header.  RBridges\n   route TRILL-encapsulated packets based on the egress RBridge\
    \ nickname\n   in the TRILL header.  An RBridge routes a TRILL-encapsulated packet\n\
    \   after modifying its MAC addresses to reflect the path to the next-hop\n  \
    \ RBridge and decrementing a Hop Count field.\n   TRILL and FCoE bear a strong\
    \ resemblance in their forwarding planes.\n   Both protocols take a routing decision\
    \ based on protocol addresses\n   above Layer 2, and both modify the Ethernet\
    \ MAC addresses on a per-\n   hop basis.  Each of the protocols uses its own routing\
    \ protocol\n   rather than using any type of bridging protocol, such as the spanning\n\
    \   tree protocol [802.1Q] or the Shortest Path Bridging protocol\n   [802.1Q].\n\
    \   FCoE and TRILL are both targeted at the data center environment, and\n   their\
    \ concurrent deployment is self-evident.  This document describes\n   an architecture\
    \ for the integrated deployment of these two protocols.\n"

  - "3.1.  FCoE over a TRILL Cloud\n   The simplest approach for running FCoE traffic\
    \ over a TRILL network\n   is presented in Figure 1.  The figure illustrates a\
    \ TRILL-enabled\n   network, in which FCoE traffic is transparently forwarded\
    \ over the\n   TRILL cloud.  The figure illustrates two ENodes, a Server and an\
    \ FCoE\n   Storage Array, an FCF, and a native Fibre Channel SAN connected to\n\
    \   the FCF.\n   FCoE traffic between the two ENodes is sent from the first ENode\
    \ over\n   the TRILL cloud to the FCF, and then back through the TRILL cloud to\n\
    \   the second ENode.\n            +---+\n            |   |_________\n       \

    \          Figure 1. The \"Separate Cloud\" Approach\n   The configuration in\
    \ Figure 1 separates the TRILL cloud(s) and the\n   FCoE cloud(s).  The TRILL\
    \ cloud routes FCoE traffic as standard\n   Ethernet traffic, and appears to the\
    \ ENodes and FCF as an Ethernet\n   LAN.  FCoE traffic routed over the TRILL cloud\
    \ includes FCoE data\n   frames, as well as FCoE control traffic, including FCoE\n\
    \   Initialization Protocol (FIP) frames.  To eliminate frame loss due to\n  \
    \ queue overflow, the switches in any TRILL Cloud used with FCoE would\n   likely\
    \ implement and use the relevant DCB protocols [TRILLPFC]\n   [TRILLCN].\n   The\
    \ main drawbacks of the Separate Cloud approach are that RBridges\n   and FCFs\
    \ are separate nodes in the network, resulting in more cabling\n   and boxes,\
    \ and that communication between ENodes usually requires\n   traversing the TRILL\
    \ cloud twice, so there are twice as many hops.\n   As mentioned above, data center\
    \ networking is converging towards a\n   consolidated and cost-effective approach,\
    \ where the same\n   infrastructure and equipment are used for both data and storage\n\
    \   traffic, and where high efficiency and minimal number of hops are\n   important\
    \ factors when designing the network topology.\n   The Separate Cloud approach\
    \ is presented as background to clarify the\n   motivation to develop an alternative\
    \ approach with a higher level of\n   integration.\n"

  - "3.2.1.  FCRB\n   Rather than using the Separate Cloud approach discussed in Section\n\
    \   3.1, an alternate approach is presented, where each switch\n   incorporates\
    \ both an FCF entity and an RBridge entity.  This\n   consolidated entity is referred\
    \ to as FCoE-forwarder-over-RBridge\n   (FCRB).\n   Figure 2 illustrates an FCRB\
    \ and its main building blocks.  An FCRB\n   can be functionally viewed as two\
    \ independent entities:\n   o An FCoE Forwarder (FCF) entity.\n   o An RBridge\
    \ entity.\n   The FCF entity is connected to one of the ports of the RBridge,\
    \ and\n   appears to the RBridge as a native Ethernet host.  A detailed\n   description\

    \ and cannot\n   be forwarded directly between two ENodes.  Thus, FCoE traffic\
    \ between\n   ENodes A and B in the topology in Figure 1 is forwarded through\
    \ the\n   path\n      ENode A-->TRILL cloud-->FCF-->TRILL cloud-->ENode B\n  \
    \ As opposed to the topology in Figure 1, the FCF in Figure 2 is\n   adjacent\
    \ to ENodes A and B.  In Figure 2, the FCRB is connected to\n   ENodes A and B,\
    \ and functions as the edge RBridge that connects these\n   two nodes to the TRILL\
    \ cloud, as well as the FCF that forwards\n   traffic between these two nodes.\
    \  Thus, traffic between ENodes A and\n   B in the topology in Figure 2 is forwarded\
    \ through the path\n      ENode A-->FCRB-->ENode B\n   Hence, the usage of FCRB\
    \ entities allows TRILL and FCoE to use common\n   infrastructure and equipment,\

    \ Layer 2 network to determine the path between the two FCFs.\n   o  Dense mode:\
    \ each node along the path between two FCFs is also an\n      FCF, and the network\
    \ is configured such that the forwarding\n      decision at each hop is taken\
    \ at the FCF layer, allowing the path\n      between the two FCFs to be based\

- title: 3.2.3.4.  Example - FCoE Control Traffic through an FCRB
  contents:
  - "3.2.3.4.  Example - FCoE Control Traffic through an FCRB\n   The previous subsections\
    \ focused on the data plane, i.e., storage\n   data exchanges transported over\
    \ an FCoE encapsulation.  FCoE also\n   requires control and management traffic\
    \ that is used for initializing\n   sessions (i.e., FIP), distributing routing\
    \ information (i.e., FSPF),\n   and administering and managing fabric.\n   The\
    \ FCoE Initialization Protocol (FIP) uses Ethernet frames with a\n   dedicated\
    \ Ethertype, allowing the FCF to distinguish these frames\n   from other traffic.\
    \  FIP uses both unicast and multicast traffic.\n   The following example describes\
    \ the forwarding scheme of a multicast\n   FIP packet sent through the network\
    \ depicted in Figure 4:\n   o  ENode A generates a multicast frame to a multicast\
    \ MAC address\n      that represents all the FCFs (All-FCF-MAC).\n   o  The packet\
    \ is forwarded to the ToR FCRB node.  The RBridge entity\n      forwards a copy\
    \ of the packet to its FCF entity, and also sends\n      the packet through the\
    \ TRILL cloud as a multicast TRILL\n      encapsulated packet.\n   o  Each of\
    \ the FCRBs then receives the packet, forwards a copy to its\n      FCF entity,\
    \ and forwards the packet through the TRILL network,\n      allowing all the FCFs\
    \ to receive the packet.\n   While FIP packets have a dedicated Ethertype and\
    \ frame format, other\n   types of FCoE control and management frames use the\
    \ same FCoE\n   encapsulation as FCoE data traffic.  Thus, the forwarding scheme\
    \ for\n   such control traffic is similar to the examples described in the\n \
    \  previous subsections, with the exception that these frames can be\n   sent\
    \ between ENodes, between FCFs, or between ENodes and FCFs.\n"
