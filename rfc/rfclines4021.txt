Abstract This document defines the initial IANA registration for permanent mail and MIME message header fields, per RFC 3864.
This document defines IANA registration for a number of mail message and MIME header fields, per registration procedures for message header fields [1].
The main body of this document is automatically generated from RDF/N3 data.
Some experimental HTML registry pages have been prepared from the same data and can be found at [27].
Structure of This Document Section 2.1 contains the templates for initial registration of mail message header fields.
Section 2.2 contains templates for initial registration of MIME header fields.
The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, RFC 2119 [9].
Registration Templates Header field registry entries are summarized in tabular form for convenience of reference and presented in full in the following sections.
