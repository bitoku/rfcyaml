Abstract This document specifies the gopher Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) scheme that was originally specified in RFC 1738.
The purpose of this document is to allow RFC 1738 to be made obsolete while keeping the information about the scheme on standards track.
Introduction URIs were previously defined in RFC 2396 [RFC2396], which was updated by RFC 3986 [RFC3986].
Those documents also specify how to define schemes for URIs.
The first definition for many URI schemes appeared in RFC 1738 [RFC1738].
Because that document has been made obsolete, this document copies the gopher URI scheme from it to allow that material to remain on standards track.
The gopher URL scheme is used to designate Internet resources accessible using the Gopher protocol.
The base Gopher protocol is described in RFC 1436 [RFC1436] and supports items and collections of items (directories).
The Gopher  protocol is a set of upward compatible extensions to the base Gopher protocol and is described in [Gopher ].
Gopher  supports associating arbitrary sets of attributes and alternate data representations with Gopher items.
Gopher URLs accommodate both Gopher and Gopher  items and item attributes.
The Gopher protocol was widely implemented in the early 1990s, but few Gopher servers are in use today.
Gopher URL Syntax A Gopher URL takes the form: gopher://<host>:<port>/<gopher path> where <gopher path> is one of: <gophertype><selector> <gophertype><selector>%09<search> <gophertype><selector>%09
If :<port> is omitted, the port defaults to 70.
<gophertype> is a single character field to denote the Gopher type of the resource to which the URL refers.
<selector> is the Gopher selector string.
In the Gopher protocol, Gopher selector strings are a sequence of octets that may contain any octets except 09 hexadecimal (US ASCII HT or tab), 0A hexadecimal (US ASCII character LF), and 0D (US ASCII character CR).
Gopher clients specify which item to retrieve by sending the Gopher selector string to a Gopher server.
Within the <gopher path>, no characters are reserved.
Note that some Gopher <selector> strings begin with a copy of the <gophertype> character, in which case that character will occur twice consecutively.
The Gopher selector string may be an empty string; this is how Gopher clients refer to the top level directory on a Gopher server.
Specifying URLs for Gopher Search Engines
If the URL refers to a search to be submitted to a Gopher search engine, the selector is followed by an encoded tab (%09) and the search string.
To submit a search to a Gopher search engine, the Gopher client sends the <selector> string (after decoding), a tab, and the search string to the Gopher server.
URL Syntax for Gopher  Items Historical note
: Gopher  was uncommon even when Gopher was popular.
URLs for Gopher  items have a second encoded tab (%09) and a Gopher  string.
Note that in this case, the %09<search> string must be supplied, although the <search> element may be the empty string.
The <gopher  string> is used to represent information required for retrieval of the Gopher  item.
Gopher  items may have alternate views and arbitrary sets of attributes, and they may have electronic forms associated with them.
To retrieve the data associated with a Gopher  URL, a client will connect to the server and send the Gopher selector, followed by a tab and the search string (which may be empty), followed by a tab and the Gopher  commands.
(denoting Gopher  items that have a  ASK form associated with them).
" refers to an item with a Gopher electronic form associated with it.
refers to all of a Gopher  item's attributes. "
$" refers to all the item attributes for all items in a Gopher directory.
To refer to specific attributes, the URL's gopher  string is "!
<attribute name>" or "$<attribute name>".
For example, to refer to the attribute containing the abstract of an item, the gopher  string would be "!
To refer to several attributes, the gopher  string consists of the attribute names separated by coded spaces.
Gopher  allows for optional alternate data representations (alternate views) of items.
To retrieve a Gopher  alternate view, a Gopher  client sends the appropriate view and language identifier (found in the item's  VIEW attribute).
To refer to a specific Gopher  alternate view, the URL's Gopher  string would be in the form:  <view name>%20<language name
For example, a Gopher  string of " application/postscript%20Es ES" refers to the Spanish language postscript alternate view of a Gopher  item.
URL Syntax for Gopher  Electronic Forms
The gopher  string for a URL that refers to an item referenced by a Gopher  electronic form (an ASK block) filled out with specific values is a coded version of what the client sends to the server.
The gopher  string is of the form:  %091%0D%0A
1%0D%0A<ask item1 value>%0D%0A <ask item2 value>%0D%0A.%0D%0A
To retrieve this item, the Gopher client sends the following text to the Gopher server.
There are many security considerations for URI schemes discussed in [RFC3986].
The Gopher protocol uses passwords in the clear for authentication, and offers no privacy, both of which are considered extremely unsafe in current practice.
