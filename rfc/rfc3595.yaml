- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   Several standards-track MIB modules have defined objects\
    \ to represent\n   an IPv6 Flow Label (sometimes referred to as Flow ID) [RFC2460]\n\
    \   [FLOWLABEL] and IPv6 Flow Label filters.  Unfortunately the result is\n  \
    \ a set of different definitions for the same piece of management\n   information.\
    \  This may lead to confusion and unnecessary complexity.\n   This document defines\
    \ a set of textual conventions (TCs) that can and\n   should be (re-)used in MIB\
    \ modules, so that they all represent an\n   IPv6 Flow Label in the same way.\
    \  In fact, PIB modules can and should\n   also use these TCs when they need to\
    \ represent an IPv6 Flow label.\n"

  - "2.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework\n   For a detailed overview of\
    \ the documents that describe the current\n   Internet-Standard Management Framework,\
    \ please refer to section 7 of\n   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].\n   Managed objects are\
    \ accessed via a virtual information store, termed\n   the Management Information\
    \ Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally\n   accessed through the Simple Network\
    \ Management Protocol (SNMP).\n   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms\
    \ defined in the\n   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies\
    \ a MIB\n   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,\n\
    \   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580\n   [RFC2580].\n"

  - "4.  Security Considerations\n   The MIB module contained in this memo does not\
    \ define any management\n   objects.  Instead, it defines a set of textual conventions\

    \  Meaningful security considerations can only be written for MIB\n   modules\
    \ that define concrete management objects.  This document has\n   therefore no\
    \ impact on the security of the Internet.\n"

- title: 7.  Acknowledgments
  contents:
  - "7.  Acknowledgments\n   This document was produced as a result of a review of\
    \ the use of\n   FlowID in a PIB module and a MIB module.  Further investigation\
    \ found\n   that FlowID and FlowLabel objects were defined in a few other MIB\n\
    \   modules.  The editor would like to thank all who contributed to the\n   discussion\
    \ that resulted in this document, particularly Juergen\n   Schoenwaelder for finding\
    \ and reporting most of the other MIB modules\n   that were using/defining a FlowLabel\
    \ object.  Juergen also suggested\n   the very first direction for a common TC\
    \ for these objects.  Further\n   contributions were received from Fred Baker,\
    \ Dan Romascanu, Kwok Ho\n   Chan, Margaret Wasserman, Brian Carpenter, Andy Bierman,\
    \ Randy\n   Presuhn, Branislav Meandzija, Brian Williams, Ravi Sahita.  We also\n\
    \   received initial input from 3GPP that expressed the requirement to be\n  \
    \ able to specify a wildcard for FlowID or FlowLabel.  Further helpful\n   review\
    \ comments were received from Brian Carpenter, John Loughney,\n   Pekka Savola.\n"
