- title: 1. Abstract
  contents:
  - "1. Abstract\n   A class of special-purpose computers has evolved to provide voice\n\
    \   messaging services.  These machines generally interface to a\n   telephone\
    \ switch and provide call answering and voice messaging\n   services.  Traditionally,\
    \ messages sent to a non-local machine are\n   transported using analog networking\
    \ protocols based on DTMF signaling\n   and analog voice playback.  As the demand\
    \ for networking increases,\n   there is a need for a standard high-quality digital\
    \ protocol to\n   connect these machines.  The following document is a profile\
    \ of the\n   Internet standard MIME and ESMTP protocols for use as a digital voice\n\
    \   messaging networking protocol. The profile is referred to as VPIM\n   (Voice\
    \ Profile for Internet Mail) in this document.\n   This profile is based on earlier\
    \ work in the Audio Message\n   Interchange Specification (AMIS) group that defined\
    \ a voice messaging\n   protocol based on X.400 technology.  This profile is intended\
    \ to\n   satisfy the user requirements statement from that earlier work with\n\
    \   the industry standard ESMTP/MIME mail protocol infrastructures\n   already\
    \ used within corporate intranets. This second version of VPIM\n   is based on\
    \ implementation experience and obsoletes RFC 1911 which\n   describes version\
    \ 1 of the profile.\n"
- title: 2. Scope
  contents:
  - "2. Scope\n   MIME is the Internet multipurpose, multimedia messaging standard.\n\
    \   This document explicitly recognizes its capabilities and provides a\n   mechanism\
    \ for the exchange of various messaging technologies,\n   primarily voice and\
    \ facsimile.\n   This document specifies a restricted profile of the Internet\n\
    \   multimedia messaging protocols for use between voice processing\n   server\
    \ platforms.  These platforms have historically been special-\n   purpose computers\
    \ and often do not have the same facilities normally\n   associated with a traditional\
    \ Internet Email-capable computer.  As a\n   result, VPIM also specifies additional\
    \ functionality as it is needed.\n   This profile is intended to specify the minimum\
    \ common set of\n   features to allow interworking between compliant systems.\n"
- title: 2.1 Voice Messaging System Limitations
  contents:
  - "2.1 Voice Messaging System Limitations\n   The following are typical limitations\
    \ of voice messaging platform\n   which were considered in creating this baseline\
    \ profile.\n     1) Text messages are not normally received and often cannot be\n\
    \     easily displayed or viewed.  They can often be processed only via\n    \
    \ text-to-speech or text-to-fax features not currently present in\n     many of\
    \ these machines.\n     2) Voice mail machines usually act as an integrated Message\n\
    \     Transfer Agent, Message Store and User Agent.  There is no relaying\n  \
    \   of messages, and RFC 822 header fields may have limited use in the\n     context\
    \ of the limited messaging features currently deployed.\n     3) Voice mail message\
    \ stores are generally not capable of\n     preserving the full semantics of an\
    \ Internet message.  As such, use\n     of a voice mail machine for gatewaying\
    \ is not supported.  In\n     particular, storage of recipient lists, \"Received\"\
    \ lines, and\n     \"Message-ID\" may be limited.\n     4) Internet-style distribution/exploder\
    \ mailing lists are not\n     typically supported.  Voice mail machines often\
    \ implement only\n     local alias lists, with error-to-sender and reply-to-sender\n\
    \     behavior.  Reply-all capabilities using a CC list are not generally\n  \
    \   available.\n     5) Error reports must be machine-parsable so that helpful\
    \ responses\n     can be voiced to users whose only access mechanism is a telephone.\n\
    \     6) The voice mail systems generally limit address entry to 16 or\n     fewer\
    \ numeric characters, and normally do not support alphanumeric\n     mailbox names.\
    \  Alpha characters are not generally used for mailbox\n     identification as\
    \ they cannot be easily entered from a telephone\n     terminal.\n"
- title: 2.2 Design Goals
  contents:
  - "2.2 Design Goals\n   It is a goal of this profile to make as few restrictions\
    \ and\n   additions to the existing Internet mail protocols as possible while\n\
    \   satisfying the requirements for interoperability with current\n   generation\
    \ voice messaging systems.  This goal is motivated by the\n   desire to increase\
    \ the accessibility to digital messaging by enabling\n   the use of proven existing\
    \ networking software for rapid development.\n   This specification is intended\
    \ for use on a TCP/IP network; however,\n   it is possible to use the SMTP protocol\
    \ suite over other transport\n   protocols.  The necessary protocol parameters\
    \ for such use is outside\n   the scope of this document.\n   This profile is\
    \ intended to be robust enough to be used in an\n   environment, such as the global\
    \ Internet with installed-base gateways\n   which do not understand MIME, though\
    \ typical use is expected to be\n   within corporate intranets.  Full functionality,\
    \ such as reliable\n   error messages and binary transport, will require careful\
    \ selection\n   of gateways (e.g., via MX records) to be used as VPIM forwarding\n\
    \   agents.  Nothing in this document precludes use of general purpose\n   MIME\
    \ email packages to read and compose VPIM messages.  While no\n   special configuration\
    \ is required to receive VPIM compliant messages,\n   some may be required to\
    \ originate compliant structures.\n   It is expected that a VPIM messaging system\
    \ will be managed by a\n   system administrator who can perform TCP/IP network\
    \ configuration.\n   When using facsimile or multiple voice encodings, it is suggested\n\
    \   that the system administrator maintain a list of the capabilities of\n   the\
    \ networked mail machines to reduce the sending of undeliverable\n   messages\
    \ due to lack of feature support.  Configuration,\n   implementation and management\
    \ of these directory listing capabilities\n   are local matters.\n"
- title: 3. Protocol Restrictions
  contents:
  - "3. Protocol Restrictions\n   This protocol does not limit the number of recipients\
    \ per message.\n   Where possible, server implementations should not restrict\
    \ the number\n   of recipients in a single message.  It is recognized that no\n\
    \   implementation supports unlimited recipients, and that the number of\n   supported\
    \ recipients may be quite low.\n   This protocol does not limit the maximum message\
    \ length.\n   Implementers should understand that some machines will be unable\
    \ to\n   accept excessively long messages.  A mechanism is defined in the RFC\n\
    \   1425 SMTP service extensions to declare the maximum message size\n   supported.\n\
    \   The message size indicated in the ESMTP SIZE parameter is in bytes,\n   not\
    \ minutes or seconds.  The number of bytes varies by voice encoding\n   format\
    \ and includes the MIME wrapper overhead.  If the length must be\n   known before\
    \ sending, an approximate translation into minutes or\n   seconds can be performed\
    \ if the voice encoding is known.\n   The following sections describe the restrictions\
    \ and additions to\n   Internet mail protocols that are required to be compliant\
    \ with this\n   VPIM v2 profile. Though various SMTP, ESMTP and MIME features\
    \ are\n   described here, the implementer is referred to the relevant RFCs for\n\
    \   complete details. It is also advisable to check for IETF drafts of\n   various\
    \ Internet Mail specifications that are later than the most\n   recent RFCs since,\
    \ for example, MIME has yet to be published as a\n   full IETF Standard. The table\
    \ in Appendix A summarizes the protocol\n   details of this profile.\n   The key\
    \ words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"\
    SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\",  \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n\
    \   document are to be interpreted as described in [REQ].\n"
- title: 4. Voice Message Interchange Format
  contents:
  - "4. Voice Message Interchange Format\n   The voice message interchange format\
    \ is a profile of the Internet\n   Mail Protocol Suite.  Any Internet Mail message\
    \ containing the format\n   defined in this section is referred to as a VPIM Message\
    \ in this\n   document.  As a result, this document assumes an understanding of\
    \ the\n   Internet Mail specifications.  Specifically, VPIM references\n   components\
    \ from the message format standard for Internet messages\n   [RFC822], the Multipurpose\
    \ Internet Message Extensions [MIME], the\n   X.400 gateway specification [X.400],\
    \ delivery status and message\n   disposition notifications [REPORT][DSN][DRPT][STATUS][MDN],\
    \ and the\n   electronic business card [MIMEDIR][VCARD].\n"
- title: 4.1 Message Addressing Formats
  contents:
  - "4.1 Message Addressing Formats\n   RFC 822 addresses are based on the domain\
    \ name system.  This naming\n   system has two components: the local part, used\
    \ for username or\n   mailbox identification; and the host part, used for global\
    \ machine\n   identification.\n"
- title: 4.1.1 VPIM Addresses
  contents:
  - "4.1.1 VPIM Addresses\n   The local part of the address shall be a US-ASCII string\
    \ uniquely\n   identifying a mailbox on a destination system.  For voice messaging,\n\
    \   the local part is a printable string containing the mailbox ID of the\n  \
    \ originator or recipient.  While alpha characters and long mailbox\n   identifiers\
    \ are permitted, most voice mail networks rely on numeric\n   mailbox identifiers\
    \ to retain compatibility with the limited 10 digit\n   telephone keypad.  As\
    \ a result, some voice messaging systems may only\n   be able to handle a numeric\
    \ local part.  The reception of\n   alphanumeric local parts on these systems\
    \ may result in the address\n   being mapped to some locally unique (but confusing\
    \ to the recipient)\n   number or, in the worst case the address could be deleted\
    \ making the\n   message un-replyable.  Additionally, it may be difficult to create\n\
    \   messages on these systems with an alphanumeric local part without\n   complex\
    \ key sequences or some form of directory lookup (see 6).\n   The use of the domain\
    \ naming system should be transparent to the\n   user.  It is the responsibility\
    \ of the voice mail machine to lookup\n   the fully-qualified domain name (FQDN)\
    \ based on the address entered\n   by the user (see 6).\n   In the absence of\
    \ a global directory, specification of the local part\n   is expected to conform\
    \ to international or private telephone\n   numbering plans.  It is likely that\
    \ private numbering plans will\n   prevail and these are left for local definition.\
    \  However, it is\n   RECOMMENDED that public telephone numbers be noted according\
    \ to the\n   international numbering plan described in [E.164]. The indication\n\
    \   that the local part is a public telephone number is given by a\n   preceding\
    \ `+' (the `+' would not be entered from a telephone keypad,\n   it is added by\
    \ the system as a flag).  Since the primary information\n   in the numeric scheme\
    \ is contained by the digits, other character\n   separators (e.g.  `-') may be\
    \ ignored (i.e. to allow parsing of the\n   numeric local mailbox) or may be used\
    \ to recognize distinct portions\n   of the telephone number (e.g. country code).\
    \  The specification of\n   the local part of a VPIM address can be split into\
    \ the four groups\n   described below:\n     1) mailbox number\n        - for\
    \ use as a private numbering plan (any number of digits)\n        - e.g.  2722@lucent.com\n\
    \     2) mailbox number+extension\n        - for use as a private numbering plan\
    \ with extensions\n          any number of digits, use of `+' as separator\n \
    \       - e.g.  2722+111@Lucent.com\n     3) +international number\n        -\
    \ for international telephone numbers conforming to E.164\n          maximum of\
    \ 15 digits\n        - e.g.  +16137637582@vm.nortel.ca\n     4) - for international\
    \ telephone numbers conforming to E.164\n          maximum of 15 digits, with\
    \ an extension (e.g. behind a\n          PBX) that has a maximum of 15 digits.\n\
    \        - e.g.  +17035245550+230@ema.org\n   Note that this address format is\
    \ designed to be compatible with\n   current usage within the voice messaging\
    \ industry.  It is not\n   compatible with the addressing formats of RFCs 2303-2304.\
    \  It is\n   expected that as telephony services become more widespread on the\n\
    \   Internet, these addressing formats will converge.\n"
- title: 4.1.2 Special Addresses
  contents:
  - "4.1.2 Special Addresses\n   Special addresses are provided for compatibility\
    \ with the conventions\n   of Internet mail.  These addresses do not use numeric\
    \ local\n   addresses, both to conform to current Internet practice and to avoid\n\
    \   conflict with existing numeric addressing plans. Two special\n   addresses\
    \ are RESERVED for use as follows:\n   postmaster@domain\n   By convention, a\
    \ special mailbox named \"postmaster\" MUST exist on all\n   systems.  This address\
    \ is used for diagnostics and should be checked\n   regularly by the system manager.\
    \ This mailbox is particularly likely\n   to receive text messages, which is not\
    \ normal on a voice processing\n   platform.  The specific handling of these messages\
    \ is an individual\n   implementation choice.\n   non-mail-user@domain\n   If\
    \ a reply to a message is not possible, such as a telephone\n   answering message,\
    \ then the special address \"non-mail-user\" must be\n   used as the originator's\

    \ number if it is available, is permitted.\n   This special address is used as\
    \ a token to indicate an unreachable\n   originator. For compatibility with the\

- title: 4.1.3 Distribution Lists
  contents:
  - "4.1.3 Distribution Lists\n   There are many ways to handle distribution list\
    \ (DL) expansions and\n   none are 'standard'.  Simple alias is a behavior closest\
    \ to what most\n   voice mail systems do today and what is to be used with VPIM\n\
    \   messages.  That is:\n     Reply to the originator - (Address in the RFC822\
    \ Reply-to or From\n                                field)\n     Errors to the\

    \   do not provide for \"Header Information\" in their messaging queues and\n\
    \   only include delivery information.  As a result, recipient\n   information\
    \ MAY be in either the To or CC header fields. If all\n   recipients cannot be\
    \ presented (e.g. unknown DL expansion) then the\n   recipient header fields MUST\
    \ be omitted to indicate that an accurate\n   list of recipients (e.g. for use\

  contents:
  - "4.3 Voice Message Content Types\n   MIME, introduced in [MIME1], is a general-purpose\

    \  It provides\n   for encoding binary data so that it can be transported over\
    \ the 7-bit\n   text-oriented SMTP protocol.  This transport encoding (denoted\
    \ by the\n   Content-Transfer-Encoding header field) is in addition to the audio\n\
    \   encoding required to generate a binary object.\n   MIME defines two transport\
    \ encoding mechanisms to transform binary\n   data into a 7 bit representation,\
    \ one designed for text-like data\n   (\"Quoted-Printable\"), and one for arbitrary\
    \ binary data (\"Base64\").\n   While Base64 is dramatically more efficient for\
    \ audio data, either\n   will work.  Where binary transport is available, no transport\n\
    \   encoding is needed, and the data can be labeled as \"Binary\".\n   An implementation\
    \ in compliance with this profile SHOULD send audio\n   and/or facsimile data\
    \ in binary form when binary message transport is\n   available.  When binary\
    \ transport is not available, implementations\n   MUST encode the audio and/or\
    \ facsimile data as Base64.  The detection\n   and decoding of \"Quoted-Printable\"\
    , \"7bit\", and \"8bit\" MUST be\n   supported in order to meet MIME requirements\
    \ and to preserve\n   interoperability with the fullest range of possible devices.\n\
    \   However, if a content is received in a transfer encoding that cannot\n   be\
    \ rendered to the user, an appropriate negative delivery status\n   notification\
    \ MUST be sent.\n   The content types described in this section are identified\

    \ voice message in this document.\n   Only the contents profiled subsequently\
    \ can be sent within a VPIM\n   voice message construct (i.e., the mulitpart/voice-message\
    \ content\n   type) to form a simple or a more complex structure (several examples\n\
    \   are given in Appendix B).  The presence of other contents within a\n   VPIM\

    \ system. In the situation where a `downgrade' is unavoidable\n   a relay hop\
    \ may be forced (by the next hop) to forward a VPIM message\n   without the ESMTP\
    \ request for positive delivery status notification.\n   It is RECOMMENDED that\
    \ the downgrading system should continue to\n   attempt to deliver the message,\
    \ but MUST send an appropriate delivery\n   notification to the originator, e.g.\
    \ the message left an ESMTP host\n   and was sent (unreliably) via SMTP.\n"
- title: 6. Directory Address Resolution
  contents:
  - "6. Directory Address Resolution\n   It is the responsibility of a VPIM system\
    \ to provide the fully-\n   qualified domain name (FQDN) of the recipient based\
    \ on the address\n   entered by the user (if the entered address is not already\
    \ a FQDN).\n   This would typically be an issue on systems that offered only a\n\
    \   telephone user interface.  The mapping of the dialed target number to\n  \
    \ a routeable FQDN address allowing delivery to the destination system\n   can\
    \ be accomplished through implementation-specific means.\n   To facilitate a local\
    \ dial-by-name cache, an implementation may wish\n   to populate local directories\
    \ with the first and last names, as well\n   as the address information extracted\
    \ from received messages.  It is\n   mandated that only address information from\
    \ vCard attachments to VPIM\n   messages be used to populate such a directory\
    \ when the vCard is\n   available. Addresses or names parsed from the header fields\
    \ of VPIM\n   messages SHOULD NOT be used to populate directories as it only\n\
    \   provides partial data.  Alternatively, bilateral agreements could be\n   made\
    \ to allow the bulk transfer of vCards between systems.\n"
- title: 7. IMAP
  contents:
  - "7. IMAP\n   The use of client/server desktop mailbox protocols like IMAP or POP\n\
    \   to retrieve VPIM messages from a IMAP or POP message store is\n   possible\
    \ without any special modifications to this VPIM\n   specification.  Email clients\
    \ (and web browsers) typically have a\n   table for mapping from MIME type to\
    \ displaying application.  The\n   audio/*, image/tiff and text/directory contents\
    \ can be configured so\n   that they invoke the correct player/recorder for rendering.\
    \  In\n   addition with IMAP clients, the first multipart/mixed content (if\n\
    \   present) will not appear since it is a generic part.  The user\n   instead\
    \ will be presented with a message that has (for example) audio\n   and image\
    \ contents.\n"
- title: 8. Management Protocols
  contents:
  - "8. Management Protocols\n   The Internet protocols provide a mechanism for the\
    \ management of\n   messaging systems, from the management of the physical network\n\
    \   through the management of the message queues.  SNMP should be\n   supported\
    \ on a compliant message machine.\n"

    \   reporting of TCP and IP protocol performance [MIB II].\n"
- title: 9. Conformance Requirements
  contents:
  - "9. Conformance Requirements\n   VPIM is a messaging application which must be\
    \ supported in several\n   environments and be supported on differing devices.\
    \  These\n   environments include traditional voice processing systems, desktop\n\
    \   voice messaging systems, store and forward relays, and protocol\n   translation\
    \ gateways.\n   In order to accommodate all environments, this document defines\
    \ two\n   areas of conformance:  transport and content.\n   Transport conformant\
    \ systems will pass VPIM messages in a store and\n   forward manner with assured\
    \ delivery notifications and without the\n   loss of information.  It is expected\
    \ that most store and forward\n   Internet mail based messaging systems will be\
    \ VPIM transport\n   compliant.\n   Content conformant systems will generate and\
    \ interpret VPIM messages.\n   Conformance in the generation of VPIM messages\
    \ indicates that the\n   restrictions of this profile are honored.  Only contents\
    \ specified in\n   this profile or extensions agreed to by bilateral agreement\
    \ may be\n   sent.  Conformance in the interpretation of VPIM messages indicates\n\
    \   that all VPIM content types and constructs can be received;  that all\n  \
    \ mandatory VPIM content types can be decoded and presented to the\n   recipient\
    \ in an appropriate manner; and that any unrenderable\n   contents result in the\
    \ appropriate notification.\n   A summary of the compliance requirements is contained\
    \ in Appendix A.\n   VPIM end systems are expected to be both transport and content\n\
    \   conformant.  They should generate conforming content, reliably send\n   it\
    \ to the next hop system, receive a message, decode the message and\n   present\
    \ it to the user.  Voice messaging systems and protocol\n   conversion gateways\
    \ are considered end systems.\n   Relay systems are expected to be transport compliant\
    \ in order to\n   receive and send conforming messages.  However, they must also\
    \ create\n   VPIM conforming delivery status notifications in the event of\n \
    \  delivery problems.\n   Desktop Email clients that support VPIM and are expected\
    \ to be\n   content conformant. Desktop email clients use various protocols and\n\
    \   API's for exchanging messages with the local message store and\n   message\
    \ transport system.  While these clients may benefit from VPIM\n   transport capabilities,\
    \ specific client-server requirements are out-\n   of-scope for this document.\n"

  contents:
  - "10.1 General Directive\n   This document is a profile of existing Internet mail\
    \ protocols.  To\n   maintain interoperability with Internet mail, any security\
    \ to be\n   provided should be part of the of the Internet security\n   infrastructure,\
    \ rather than a new mechanism or some other mechanism\n   outside of the Internet\
    \ infrastructure.\n"
- title: 10.2 Threats and Problems
  contents:
  - "10.2 Threats and Problems\n   Both Internet mail and voice messaging have their\
    \ own set of threats\n   and countermeasures.  As such, this specification does\
    \ not create any\n   security issues not already existing in the profiled Internet\
    \ mail\n   and voice mail protocols themselves.  This section attends only to\n\
    \   the set of additional threats which ensue from integrating the two\n   services.\n"
- title: 10.2.1 Spoofed sender
  contents:
  - "10.2.1 Spoofed sender\n   The actual sender of the voice message might not be\
    \ the same as that\n   specified in the Sender or From header fields of the message\
    \ content\n   header fields or the MAIL FROM address from the SMTP envelope. \
    \ In a\n   tightly constrained environment, sufficient physical and software\n\
    \   controls may be able to ensure prevention of this problem.  In\n   addition,\
    \ the recognition of the senders voice may provide confidence\n   of the sender's\
    \ identity irrespective of that specified in Sender or\n   From.  It should be\
    \ recognized that SMTP implementations do not\n   provide inherent authentication\
    \ of the senders of messages, nor are\n   sites under obligation to provide such\
    \ authentication.\n"
- title: 10.2.2 Unsolicited voice mail
  contents:
  - "10.2.2 Unsolicited voice mail\n   Assigning an Internet mail address to a voice\
    \ mailbox opens the\n   possibility of receiving unsolicited messages (either\
    \ text or voice\n   mail).  Traditionally voice mail systems operated in closed\n\
    \   environments and were not susceptible to unknown senders.  Voice mail\n  \
    \ users have a higher expectation of mailbox privacy and may consider\n   such\
    \ messages as a security breach.  Many Internet mail systems are\n   choosing\
    \ to block all messages from unknown sources in an attempt to\n   curb this problem.\n"
- title: 10.2.3 Message disclosure
  contents:
  - "10.2.3 Message disclosure\n   Users of voice messaging systems have an expectation\
    \ of a level of\n   message privacy which is higher than the level provided by\
    \ Internet\n   mail without security enhancements.  This expectation of privacy\
    \ by\n   users SHOULD be preserved as much as possible.\n"
- title: 10.3 Security Techniques
  contents:
  - "10.3 Security Techniques\n   Sufficient physical and software control may be\
    \ acceptable in\n   constrained environments.  Further, the profile specified\
    \ in this\n   document does not in any way preclude the use of any Internet object\n\
    \   or channel security protocol to encrypt, authenticate, or non-\n   repudiate\
    \ the messages.\n"

  - "19. Appendix F - Change History: RFC 1911 to this Document\n   The updated profile\
    \ in this document is based on the experience of a\n   proof of concept demonstration\
    \ of VPIM at EMA'96 in April 1996 and a\n   subsequent demonstration of products\
    \ at EMA'97 in April 1997.  This\n   version of the profile is significantly different\
    \ from the previous\n   described in [VPIM1].  The changes are categorized as\
    \ general,\n   content, transport and compliance.  They are detailed below:\n\
    \   1. General\n     - All definitions are now contained in separate documents\
    \ that are\n     referenced by this profile.  The new documents include:\n   \
    \     - a refined multipart/voice-message definition\n        - a refined (i.e.,\
    \ added nibble order) audio/32KADPCM definition\n        - the definitions of\
    \ TIFF-F and image/tiff for fax images\n        - the Content-Duration definition\n\
    \     - Changed the Voice version to 2.0\n     - Added Table of Contents and more\
    \ examples\n     - Various editorial updates to improve readability\n     - Added\
    \ more security considerations\n   2. Content\n     - Modified multipart/voice-message\
    \ content type by dropping the\n     positional dependence of contents while restricting\
    \ its contents to\n     voice message specific content types\n     - Explicitly\
    \ indicated other contents that may be present ina\n     multipart/mixed content\
    \ type\n     - Explicitly defined the forwarding model using message/RFC822\n\
    \     - Explained the use of reply-to and from header fields for\n     addressing\
    \ message replies\n     - Deprecated the special \"loopback\" address because\
    \ of security\n     concerns and its use only for testing\n     - Defined the\
    \ non-mail-user reserved address to support the case in\n     which replies to\
    \ the originator are not possible\n     - Eliminated the text name in the \"To\"\
    \ and \"CC\" header fields.\n     Deprecated ordering of text names in the \"\
    From\" header.\n     - Added support for facsimile using TIFF-F in an image/tiff;\n\
    \     application=faxbw content type\n     - Profiled vCard in the text/directory\
    \ body part for transport of\n     directory information about the originator\n\
    \     - Loosened text restriction\n     - Added additional details on delivery\
    \ and receipt notifications\n     - Added support for message disposition notifications,\
    \ also known\n     as receipt notifications.\n     - Added suggested addressing\
    \ formats\n     - Described handling of private messages\n     - Described the\
    \ handling of non-profiled contents in VPIM messages\n     - Described the use\
    \ of Content-Disposition to semantically identify\n     audio contents\n   3.\
    \ Transport\n     - Moved binary support to optional\n     - Added optional ESMTP\
    \ keywords for return of content, enhanced\n     status codes, original recipient,\
    \ and envelope ID\n     - Described use of null MAIL FROM address\n   4. Compliance\n\
    \     - Added an explicit section on conformance specifying conformance\n    \
    \ to content or transport\n     - Improved conformance table in Appendix A\n"
