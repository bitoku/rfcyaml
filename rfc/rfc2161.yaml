- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   This document contains the definitions, originally contained\
    \ in RFC\n   1495 and RFC 1341, on how to carry ODA in MIME, and how to translate\n\
    \   it to its X.400 representation.\n"
- title: 1.1.  The Application/ODA MIME content-type
  contents:
  - "1.1.  The Application/ODA MIME content-type\n   The \"ODA\" subtype of application\
    \ is used to indicate that  a body\n   contains  information  encoded according\
    \ to the Office Document\n   Architecture  [ODA]   standards,  using  the  ODIF\
    \ representation\n   format.   For  application/oda, the Content-Type line should\
    \ also\n   specify an attribute/value  pair  that indicates  the document\n  \
    \ application profile (DAP), using the key word \"profile\", and the\n   document\
    \ class, using the keyword \"class\".\n   For the keyword \"class\", the values\
    \ \"formatted\", \"processable\" and\n   \"formatted-processable\" are legal values.\n\
    \   Thus an appropriate header field  might look like this:\n   Content-Type:\
    \  application/oda; profile=Q112; class=formatted\n   Consult the ODA standard\
    \ [T.411] for further information.\n   The Base64 content-transfer-encoding is\
    \ appropriate for carrying ODA.\n"
- title: 1.2.  ODA - application/oda
  contents:
  - "1.2.  ODA - application/oda\n   X.400 Body Part: ODA\n   MIME Content-Type: application/oda\n\
    \   Conversion: None\n   Comments:\n   The ODA body part is defined in the CCITT\
    \ document T.411 [T.411],\n   appendix E, section E.2, \"ODA identification in\
    \ the P2 protocol of\n   MHS\"\n   An abbreviated version of its ASN.1 definition\

    \ { 2 8 1 0 1 }\n   Mapping from X.400 to MIME, the following is done:\n   The\
    \ Parameters.document-application-profile is mapped onto the MIME\n   parameter\
    \ \"profile\" according to the table below.\n   Profile         OBJECT IDENTIFIER\n\
    \   Q112            { iso (1) identified-organization (3) ewos (16)\n        \
    \             eg (2) oda (6) profile (0)  q112 (1) }\n   The Parameters.document-architecture-class\
    \ is mapped onto the MIME\n   parameter \"class\" according to the table below.\n\
    \   String                  Integer\n   formatted               formatted(0)\n\
    \   processable             processable(1)\n   formatted-processable   formatted-processable(2)\n\
    \   NOTE: This parameter is not defined in RFC 1341.\n   The body of the MIME\
    \ content-type is the Data part of the ODA body\n   part.\n   When mapping from\
    \ MIME to X.400, the following steps are done:\n   The Parameters.document-application-profile\
    \ and Parameters.document-\n   architecture-class are set from the tables above.\
    \  If any of the\n   parameters are missing, the values for Q112 and formatted-processable\n\
    \   are used.\n   It is an option for the gateway implementor to try to access\
    \ them\n   from inside the document, where they are defined as\n   document-profile.document-characteristics.document-architecture-class\n\
    \   document-profile.document-characteristics.document-application-\n   profile\n\
    \   Gateways are NOT required to do this, since the document-\n   characteristics\
    \ are optional parameters.  If a gateway does not, it\n   simply uses the defaulting\
    \ rules defined above.\n   The OBJECT IDENTIFIERs for the document application\
    \ profile and for\n   ODA {2 8 0 0} must be added to the Encoded Information Types\n\
    \   parameter of the message envelope.\n"
- title: 2.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "2.  Security Considerations\n   ODA body parts have the natural propensity of\
    \ complex structures that\n   it is hard to find out what the parts are capable\
    \ of.\n   Moreover, ODA is an extensible architecture, where new content\n   portions\
    \ may be added at any time, so that the threats posed by this\n   body part may\
    \ change over time.\n   However, no security risks related to ODA are known at\
    \ this time.\n"
