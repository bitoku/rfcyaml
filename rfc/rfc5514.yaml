- title: Abstract
  contents:
  - "Abstract\n   There is a lack of IPv6 utilization in early 2009; this is partly\n\
    \   linked to the fact that the number of IPv6 nodes is rather low.  This\n  \
    \ document proposes to vastly increase the number of IPv6 hosts by\n   transforming\
    \ all Social Networking platforms into IPv6 networks.\n   This will immediately\
    \ add millions of IPv6 hosts to the existing IPv6\n   Internet.  This document\
    \ includes sections on addressing and\n   transport of IPv6 over a Social Network.\
    \  A working prototype has\n   been developed.\n"
- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   While the IPv6 protocols are well-known for years, not every\
    \ host\n   uses IPv6 (at least in March 2009), and most network users are not\n\
    \   aware of what IPv6 is or are even afraid by IPv6 because it is\n   unknown.\n\
    \   On the other hand, Social Networks (like Facebook, LinkedIn, etc.)\n   are\
    \ well-known by users and the usage of those networks is huge.\n   This document\
    \ describes how to leverage Social Networks in order to\n   make more people aware\
    \ of IPv6 and to add several thousands of IPv6\n   routers to the Internet.\n"
- title: 2.  Architecture
  contents:
  - "2.  Architecture\n   With IPv6 over Social Network (IPoSN):\n   o  Every user\
    \ is a router with at least one loopback interface;\n   o  Every friend or connection\
    \ between users will be used as a point-\n      to-point link.\n   On social networks,\
    \ users want to have multiple friends, partners, or\n   relations with other users.\
    \  Therefore, it can be expected that there\n   is a heavily meshed network among\
    \ these users.  This will provide for\n   good IPv6 connectivity because each\
    \ user (IPoSN router) will be IPv6\n   connected to all his/her friends (IPoSN\
    \ neighbor routers).\n   Several Social Network Applications (SNAs) allow for\
    \ plug-ins or for\n   other applications to be mashed with the social network.\
    \  Those\n   applications can then generate IPv6 packets on the behalf of the\n\
    \   users.  Those packets can then be transferred hop by hop, or rather\n   user\
    \ by user, over the mashed SNA/IPv6, until they reach their\n   destination.\n\
    \   The usual policy of an SNA is to only allow the account owner to\n   modify\
    \ an account.  Therefore, the IPv6 processing of a packet\n   received by an SNA\
    \ account must be explicitly executed by the account\n   owner using a web action;\
    \ this action will give the router CPU a\n   nudge to process all received IPv6\
    \ packets.  This behavior has two\n   impacts on the IPv6 network:\n   1.  the\
    \ account owner must explicitly 'run the CPU' in order to\n       forward or to\
    \ receive IPv6 packets; this is an opportunity for\n       IPoSN to detail all\
    \ its operation (one goal is education)\n   2.  the latency between two nodes\
    \ over such a network can be very\n       high, and timers (especially the routing\
    \ timers; see Section 3)\n       will have to be modified.\n   A latency of several\
    \ hours has an impact on the transport protocols.\n   UDP SHOULD be used, and\
    \ TCP SHOULD NOT be used.\n"
- title: 2.1.  Addressing
  contents:
  - "2.1.  Addressing\n   In SNA, all users have a unique numerical identification.\
    \  Assuming\n   that there are less than 2**64 users on the SNA, the IPv6 global\n\
    \   address of the router loopback will be a /64 prefix (such as 2001:\n   db8:face:b00c::/64)\
    \ followed by the SNA identification.  As this\n   address is a loopback address,\
    \ the prefix length will always be /128.\n   As the same /64 prefix is used for\
    \ all SNA users, they will all\n   appear as being part of the same /64 network.\n\
    \   On each interface, the link-local address will be generated by\n   appending\
    \ the SNA identification to the fe80::/64 prefix.\n   For example, here are two\
    \ IPoSN addresses generated for the user\n   620147832 (this is 0x24f6b478 in\
    \ hexadecimal):\n   o  Global: 2001:db8:face:b00c::24f6:b478/128\n   o  Link-local:\
    \ fe80::24f6:b478/64\n"
- title: 2.2.  Address Translation
  contents:
  - "2.2.  Address Translation\n   With the choice of the example prefix for all global\
    \ addresses, an\n   IPv6-to-IPv6 Non-Carrier Grade NAT (NCGN) must be implemented\
    \ and\n   linked to at least one 'edge' SNA user whose account will be used to\n\
    \   pass (and translate) IPv6 packets between IPoSN and the real IPv6\n   Internet.\
    \  The gateway and NAT functions are out of scope of the\n   present document.\n"
- title: 3.  Choice of IGP
  contents:
  - "3.  Choice of IGP\n   As seen in the architecture section (Section 2, the propagation\
    \ of\n   IPv6 packets only happens when a user activates the IPoSN application\n\
    \   linked to his/her SNA account.  Therefore, propagation delays are\n   measured\
    \ in hours or days compared to microseconds over the Internet\n   fishbone.  Moreover,\
    \ the jitter is also very high as different users\n   have different habits regarding\
    \ the use of SNA.\n   IPoSN SHOULD implement RIPng [RFC2080], which is relatively\
    \ immune to\n   jitter and does not rely on flooding messages to all neighboring\n\
    \   routers.  OSPFv3 [RFC5340] SHOULD NOT be used over IPoSN.\n   Routing protocols\
    \ for Delay Tolerant Networks MAY be use for IPoSN.\n"

  - "4.  Working Prototype\n   A working prototype has been developed by the author\
    \ and is freely\n   available: IPv6 over Facebook Social Network [IPv6overFacebook].\
    \  It\n   uses the LAMP architecture.\n   Some statistics as of March 26, 2009\
    \ (pre-standard implementation of\n   course):\n   o  Packet rate: 160 packets\
    \ per minute\n   o  Number of nodes: 3800\n   o  Largest FIB: 1352\n   o  NAT66\
    \ packet counters:\n      *  to the Internet: 8,500\n      *  from the Internet:\

- title: 5.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "5.  Security Considerations\n   As the users cannot really control what they\
    \ are sending (they send\n   IPv6 packets through a well-controlled web interface),\
    \ there is no\n   threat to send spoofed packets.  The only exception is at the\
    \ NAT66\n   gateway where packets from the real Internet can be received;\n  \
    \ therefore, NAT66 gateway MUST implement anti-spoofing.\n   Denial of service\
    \ (packet flooding) can happen if a malicious user\n   uses a web tool to request\
    \ a ping diagnostic every second.\n   Therefore, implementation SHOULD implement\
    \ a rate limit on each web\n   page that can generate an IPv6 packet.\n   Denial\
    \ of service (packet flooding) can also happen at the NAT66\n   gateway from the\
    \ real Internet.  A rate limiter SHOULD also be\n   implemented at the NAT66 gateway.\n"
