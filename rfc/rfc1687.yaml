  - "Executive Summary\n   Key points:\n   1)  Large corporate users generally view\
    \ IPng with disfavor.\n   2)  Industry and the IETF community have very different\
    \ values\n       and viewpoints which lead to orthogonal assessments concerning\n\
    \       the desirability of deploying IPng.\n   3)  This paper provides insight\
    \ into the mindset of a large\n       corporate user concerning the relevant issues\
    \ surrounding an\n       IPng deployment.  The bottom line is that a new deployment\
    \ of\n       IPng runs counter to several business drivers.  A key point to\n\
    \       highlight is that end users actually buy applications -- not\n       networking\
    \ technologies.\n   4)  There are really only two compelling reasons for a large\
    \ end\n       user to deploy IPng:\n       A) The existence of must-have products\
    \ which are tightly coupled\n           with IPng.\n       B) Receipt of a command\
    \ to deploy IPng from senior management.\n          The former would probably\
    \ be a function of significant\n          technological advances.  The latter\
    \ probably would be a\n          function of a convergence of IPng with International\n\
    \          Standards (OSI).\n   5)  Five end user requirements for IPng are presented:\n\
    \       A) The IPng approach must permit piecemeal transitions.\n       B) The\

- title: Introduction
  contents:
  - "Introduction\n   The goal of this paper is to examine the implications of IPng\
    \ from\n   the point of view of Fortune 100 corporations which have heavily\n\
    \   invested in TCP/IP technology in order to achieve their (non-computer\n  \
    \ related) business goals.\n   It is our perspective that End Users currently\
    \ view IPng with\n   disfavor.  This note seeks to explain some of the reasons\
    \ why an end\n   user's viewpoint may differ significantly from a \"traditional\
    \ IETF\"\n   perspective.  It addresses some of the reasons which cause IPng to\
    \ be\n   viewed by end users as a \"threat\" rather than as an \"opportunity\"\
    .\n   It enumerates some existing End User dissatisfactions with IPv4\n   (i.e.,\
    \ current TCP/IP network layer).  These dissatisfactions may\n   perhaps be eventually\
    \ exploited to \"sell\" IPng to users.  Finally, it\n   identifies the most compelling\
    \ reasons for end users to deploy IPng.\n   In any case, the IETF community should\
    \ be warned that their own\n   enthusiasm for IPng is generally not shared by\
    \ end users and that\n   convincing end users to deploy IPng technologies may\
    \ be very\n   difficult -- assuming it can be done at all.\n"
- title: The Internet and TCP/IP Protocols are not Identical
  contents:
  - "The Internet and TCP/IP Protocols are not Identical\n   The Internet Engineering\
    \ Task Force (IETF) community closely\n   associates TCP/IP protocols with the\
    \ Internet.  In many cases it is\n   difficult to discern from the IETF perspective\
    \ where the world-wide\n   Internet infrastructure ends and the services of the\
    \ TCP/IP Protocol\n   Suite begin -- they are not always distinguishable from\
    \ each other.\n   Historically they both stem from the same roots:  DARPA was\
    \ the\n   creator of TCP/IP and of the seminal \"Internet\".  The services\n \
    \  provided by the Internet have been generally realized by the \"TCP/IP\n   protocol\
    \ family\".  The Internet has, in turn, become a primary\n   vehicle for the definition,\
    \ development, and transmission of the\n   various TCP/IP protocols in their various\
    \ stages of maturity.  Thus,\n   the IETF community has a mindset which assumes\
    \ that there is a strong\n   symbiotic relationship between the two.\n   End users\
    \ do not share this assumption -- despite the fact that many\n   end users have\
    \ widely deployed TCP/IP protocols and extensively use\n   the Internet.  It is\
    \ important for the IETF community to realize,\n   however, that TCP/IP protocols\
    \ and the Internet are generally viewed\n   to be two quite dissimilar things\
    \ by the large end user.  That is,\n   while the Internet may be a partial selling\
    \ point for some TCP/IP\n   purchases, it is rarely even a primary motivation\
    \ for the majority of\n   purchases.  Many end users, in fact, have sizable TCP/IP\
    \ deployments\n   with no Internet connectivity at all.  Thus, many end users\
    \ view the\n   relationship between the Internet and TCP/IP protocols to be tenuous\n\
    \   at best.\n   More importantly, many corporations have made substantial investments\n\
    \   in (non-Internet) external communications infrastructures.  A variety\n  \
    \ of reasons account for this including the fact that until recently\n   the Internet\
    \ was excluded from the bilateral agreements and\n   international tariffs necessary\
    \ for international commerce.  In any\n   case, end users today are not (in the\
    \ general case) dependent upon\n   the Internet to support their business processes.\
    \  [Note: the\n   previous sentence does not deny that many Fortune 100 employees\
    \ (such\n   as the author) are directly dependent upon the Internet to fulfill\n\
    \   their job responsibilities: The Internet has become an invaluable\n   tool\
    \ for many corporations' \"research and education\" activities.\n   However, it\
    \ is rarely used today for activities which directly affect\n   the corporations'\
    \ financial \"bottom line\":  commerce.]  By contrast,\n   large End Users with\
    \ extensive internal TCP/IP deployments may\n   perhaps view TCP/IP technology\
    \ to be critically important to their\n   corporation's core business processes.\n"
- title: Security Islands
  contents:
  - "Security Islands\n   Another core philosophical difference between large end\
    \ users and the\n   IETF is concerning the importance of Security Islands (i.e.,\n\
    \   firewalls).  The prevalent IETF perspective is that Security Islands\n   are\
    \ \"A Bad Thing\".  The basic IETF assumption is that the\n   applications they\
    \ are designing are universally needed and that\n   Security Islands provide undesirable\
    \ filters for that usage.  That\n   is, the IETF generally has a world view which\
    \ presupposes that data\n   access should be unrestricted and widely available.\n\
    \   By contrast, corporations generally regard data as being a\n   \"sensitive\"\
    \ corporate asset:  If compromised the very viability of\n   the corporation itself\
    \ may in some cases be at risk.  Corporations\n   therefore presuppose that data\
    \ exchange should be restricted.\n   Large end users also tend to believe that\
    \ their employees have\n   differing data access needs:  Factory workers have\
    \ different\n   computing needs than accountants who have different needs than\n\
    \   aeronautical engineers who have different needs than research\n   scientists.\
    \  A corporation's networking department(s) seeks to ensure\n   that each class\
    \ of employee actually receives the type of services\n   they require.  A security\
    \ island is one of the mechanisms by which\n   the appropriate service levels\
    \ may be provided to the appropriate\n   class of employee, particularly in regards\
    \ to external access\n   capabilities.\n   More importantly, there are differing\
    \ classes of computer resources\n   within a corporation.  A certain percentage\
    \ of these resources are\n   absolutely critical to the continuing viability of\
    \ that corporation.\n   These systems should never (ever) be accessible from outside\
    \ of the\n   company.  These \"corporate jewels\" must be protected by viable\n\
    \   security mechanisms.  Security islands are one very important\n   component\
    \ within a much larger total security solution.\n   For these reasons we concur\
    \ with the observation made by Yakov\n   Rekhter (of IBM) and Bob Moskowitz (of\
    \ Chrysler) in their joint\n   electronic mail message of January 28, 1994.  They\
    \ wrote:\n   \"Hosts within sites that use IP can be partitioned into three\n\
    \   categories:\n    -    hosts that do not require Internet access.\n    -  \
    \  hosts that need access to a limited set of Internet\n         services (e.g.,\
    \ Email, FTP, netnews, remote login) which can\n         be handled by application\
    \ layer relays.\n    -    hosts that need unlimited access (provided via IP\n\
    \         connectivity) to the Internet.\"\n   The exact mechanism by which a\
    \ corporation will satisfy the differing\n   needs of these three classes of devices\
    \ must be independently\n   determined by that corporation based upon a number\
    \ of internal\n   factors.  Each independent solution will determine how that\n\
    \   corporation defines their own version of \"security island\".\n   Thus, if\
    \ end users use the Internet at all, they will generally do so\n   through a \"\
    security island\" of their own devising.  The existence of\n   the security island\
    \ is yet another element to (physically and\n   emotionally) decouple the End\
    \ User from the Internet.  That is, while\n   the end user may use the Internet,\
    \ their networks (in the general\n   case) are neither directly attached to it\
    \ nor are their core business\n   processes today critically dependent upon it.\n"
- title: Networking from a Large End User's Perspective
  contents:
  - "Networking from a Large End User's Perspective\n   The following five key characteristics\
    \ describe Boeing's environment\n   and are probably generally representative\
    \ of other large TCP/IP\n   deployments. The author believes that an understanding\
    \ of these\n   characteristics is very important for obtaining insight into how\
    \ the\n   large end user is likely to view IPng.\n   1) Host Ratio\n      Many\
    \ corporations explicitly try to limit the number of their\n      TCP/IP hosts\
    \ that are directly accessible from the Internet.  This\n      is done for a variety\
    \ of reasons (e.g., security).   While the\n      ratio of those hosts that have\
    \ direct Internet access capabilities\n      to those hosts without such capabilities\
    \ will vary from company to\n      company, ratios ranging from 1:1000 to 1:10,000\
    \ (or more) are not\n      uncommon.  The implication of this point is that the\
    \ state of the\n      world-wide (IPv4) Internet address space only directly impacts\
    \ a\n      tiny percentage of the currently deployed TCP/IP hosts within a\n \
    \     large corporation.  This is true even if the entire population is\n    \
    \  currently using Internet-assigned addresses.\n   2) Router-to-Host Ratio\n\
    \      Most corporations have significantly more TCP/IP hosts than they\n    \
    \  have IP routers.  Ratios ranging between 100:1 to 600:1 (or more)\n      are\
    \ common. The implication of this point is that a transition\n      approach which\
    \ solely demands changes to routers is generally much\n      less disruptive to\
    \ a corporation than an approach which demands\n      changes to both routers\
    \ and hosts.\n   3) Business Factor\n      Large corporations exist to fulfill\
    \ some business purpose such as\n      the construction of airplanes, baseball\
    \ bats, cars, or some other\n      product or service offering.  Computing is\
    \ an essential tool to\n      help automate business processes in order to more\
    \ efficiently\n      accomplish the business goals of the corporation.  Automation\
    \ is\n      accomplished via applications.  Data communications, operating\n \
    \     systems, and computer hardware are the tools used by applications\n    \
    \  to accomplish their goals.  Thus, users actually buy applications\n      and\
    \ not networking technologies.  The central lesson of this point\n      is that\
    \ IPng will be deployed according to the applications which\n      use it and\
    \ not because it is a better technology.\n   4) Integration Factor\n      Large\
    \ corporations currently support many diverse computing\n      environments. This\
    \ diversity limits the effectiveness of a\n      corporation's computing assets\
    \ by hindering data sharing,\n      application interoperability, \"application\
    \ portability\", and\n      software re-usability.  The net effect is stunted\
    \ application life\n      cycles and increased support costs.  Data communications\
    \ is but\n      one of the domains which contribute towards this diversity.  For\n\
    \      example, The Boeing Company currently has deployed at least\n      sixteen\
    \ different protocol families within its networks (e.g.,\n      TCP/IP, SNA, DECnet,\
    \ OSI, IPX/SPX, AppleTalk, XNS, etc.).  Each\n      distinct Protocol Family population\
    \ potentially implies unique\n      training, administrative, support, and infrastructure\n\
    \      requirements.  Consequently, corporate goals often exist to\n      eliminate\
    \ or merge diverse Data Communications Protocol Family\n      deployments in order\
    \ to reduce network support costs and to\n      increase the number of devices\
    \ which can communicate together\n      (i.e., foster interoperability).  This\
    \ results in a basic\n      abhorrence to the possibility of introducing \"Yet\
    \ Another\n      Protocol\" (YAP).  Consequently, an IPng solution which introduces\n\
    \      an entirely new set of protocols will be negatively viewed simply\n   \
    \   because its by-products are more roadblocks to interoperability\n      coupled\
    \ with more work, expense, and risk to support the end\n      users' computing\
    \ resources and business goals. Having said this,\n      it should be observed\
    \ that this abhorrence may be partially\n      overcome by \"extenuating circumstances\"\
    \ such as applications using\n      IPng which meet critical end-user requirements\
    \ or by broad\n      (international) commercial support.\n   5) Inertia Factor\n\
    \      There is a natural tendency to continue to use the current IP\n      protocol\
    \ (IPv4) regardless of the state of the Internet's IPv4\n      address space.\
    \ Motivations supporting inertia include the\n      following:  existing application\
    \ dependencies (including\n      Application Programming Interface (API) dependencies);\
    \ opposition\n      to additional protocol complexity; budgetary constraints limiting\n\
    \      additional hardware/software expenses; additional address\n      management\
    \ and naming service costs; transition costs; support\n      costs; training costs;\
    \ etc.  As the number of Boeing's deployed\n      TCP/IP hosts continues to grow\
    \ towards the 100,000 mark, the\n      inertial power of this population becomes\
    \ increasingly strong.\n      However, inertia even exists with smaller populations\
    \ simply\n      because the cost to convert or upgrade the systems are not\n \
    \     warranted.  Consequently, pockets of older \"legacy system\"\n      technologies\
    \ often exist in specific environments (e.g., we still\n      have pockets of\
    \ the archaic BSC protocol).  The significance of\n      this point is that unless\
    \ there are significant business benefits\n      to justify an IPng deployment,\
    \ economics will oppose such a\n      deployment.  Thus, even if the forthcoming\
    \ IPng protocol proves to\n      be \"the ultimate and perfect protocol\", it\
    \ is unrealistic to\n      imagine that the entire IPv4 population will ever transition\
    \ to\n      IPng.  This means that should we deploy IPng within our network,\n\
    \      there will be an ongoing requirement for our internal IPng\n      deployment\
    \ to be able to communicate with our internal IPv4\n      community.  This requirement\
    \ is unlikely to go away with time.\n"
- title: Address Depletion Doesn't Resonate With Users
  contents:
  - "Address Depletion Doesn't Resonate With Users\n   Thus, the central, bottom-line\
    \ question concerning IPng from the\n   large corporate user perspective is: \
    \ What are the benefits which\n   will justify the expense of deploying IPng?\n\
    \   At this time we can conceive of only four possible causes which may\n   motivate\
    \ us to consider deploying IPng:\n   Possible Cause:                        Possible\
    \ Corporate Response:\n   1) Many Remote (external) Peers        Gateway external\
    \ systems only.\n      solely use IPng.\n   2) Internet requires IPng usage. \
    \      Gateway external systems only.\n   3) \"Must have\" products are tightly\
    \    Upgrade internal corporate\n      coupled with IPng (e.g., \"flows\"    network\
    \ to support IPng where\n      for real-time applications).        that functionality\
    \ is needed.\n   4) Senior management directs IPng      Respond appropriately.\n\
    \      usage.\n   It should explicitly be noted that the reasons which are compelling\n\
    \   the Internet Community to create IPng (i.e., the scalability of IPv4\n   over\
    \ the Internet) are not themselves adequate motivations for users\n   to deploy\
    \ IPng within their own private networks.  That is, should\n   IPng usage become\
    \ mandated as a prerequisite for Internet usage, a\n   probable response to this\
    \ mandate would be to convert our few hosts\n   with external access capabilities\
    \ to become IPng-to-IPv4\n   application-layer gateways.  This would leave the\
    \ remainder of our\n   vast internal TCP/IP deployment unchanged.  Consequently,\
    \ given\n   gateways for external access, there may be little motivation for a\n\
    \   company's internal network to support IPng.\n"
- title: User's IPv4 "Itches" Needing Scratching
  contents:
  - "User's IPv4 \"Itches\" Needing Scratching\n   The end user's \"loyalty\" to IPv4\
    \ should not be interpreted to mean\n   that everything is necessarily \"perfect\"\
    \ with existing TCP/IP\n   deployments and that there are therefore no \"itches\"\
    \ which an\n   improved IPv4 network layer -- or an IPng -- can't \"scratch\"\
    .  The\n   purpose of this section is to address some of the issues which are\n\
    \   very troubling to many end users:\n   A)  Security.  TCP/IP protocols are\
    \ commonly deployed upon broadcast\n       media (e.g., Ethernet Version 2). \
    \ However, TCP/IP mechanisms to\n       encrypt passwords or data which traverse\
    \ this media are\n       inadequate.  This is a very serious matter which needs\
    \ to be\n       expeditiously resolved.  An integrated and effective TCP/IP\n\
    \       security architecture needs to be defined and become widely\n       implemented\
    \ across all venders' TCP/IP products.\n   B)  User Address Space privacy.  Current\
    \ IPv4 network addressing\n       policies require that end users go to external\
    \ entities to obtain\n       IP network numbers for use in their own internal\
    \ networks.  These\n       external entities have the hubris to determine whether\
    \ these\n       network requests are \"valid\" or not.  It is our belief that\
    \ a\n       corporation's internal addressing policies are their own private\n\
    \       affair -- except in the specific instances in which they may\n       affect\
    \ others.  Consequently, a real need exists for two classes\n       of IPv4 network\
    \ numbers: those which are (theoretically) visible\n       to the Internet today\
    \ (and thus are subject to external\n       requirements) and those which will\
    \ never be connected to the\n       Internet (and thus are strictly private).\
    \  We believe that the\n       concept of \"local addresses\" is a viable compromise\
    \ between the\n       justifiable need of the Internet to steward scarce global\n\
    \       resources and the corporate need for privacy.  \"Local addresses\"\n \
    \      by definition are non-globally-unique addresses which should\n       never\
    \ be routed (or seen) by the Internet infrastructure.\n       We believe that\
    \ 16 contiguous Class B \"local addresses\" need to\n       immediately be made\
    \ available for internal corporate usage.  Such\n       an availability may also\
    \ reduce the long-term demand for new IPv4\n       network numbers (see RFC 1597).\n\
    \   C)  Self-Defining Networks.  Large End Users have a pressing need for\n  \
    \     plug-and-play TCP/IP networks which auto-configure, auto-address,\n    \
    \   and auto-register.  End users have repeatedly demonstrated our\n       inability\
    \ to make the current manual methods work (i.e., heavy\n       penalties for human\
    \ error).  We believe that the existing DHCP\n       technology is a good beginning\
    \ in this direction.\n   D)  APIs and network integration.  End users have deployed\
    \ many\n       differing complex protocol families.  We need tools by which\n\
    \       these diverse deployments may become integrated together along\n     \
    \  with viable transition tools to migrate proprietary\n       alternatives to\
    \ TCP/IP-based solutions.  We also desire products\n       to use \"open\" multi-vendor,\
    \ multi-platform, exposed Application\n       Programming Interfaces (APIs) which\
    \ are supported across several\n       data communications protocol \"families\"\
    \ to aid in this\n       integration effort.\n   E)  International Commerce. \
    \ End users are generally unsure as to\n       what extent TCP/IP can be universally\
    \ used for international\n       commerce today and whether this is a cost-effective\
    \ and \"safe\"\n       option to satisfy our business requirements.\n   F)  Technological\
    \ Advances.  We have ongoing application needs which\n       demand a continual\
    \ \"pushing\" of the existing technology.  Among\n       these needs are viable\
    \ (e.g., integratable into our current\n       infrastructures) solutions to the\
    \ following: mobile hosts,\n       multimedia applications, real-time applications,\
    \ very\n       high-bandwidth applications, improved very low-bandwidth (e.g.,\n\
    \       radio based) applications, standard-TCP/IP-based transaction\n       processing\
    \ applications (e.g., multi-vendor distributed\n       databases).\n   Only Two\
    \ Motivations For Users To Deploy IPng\n   Despite this list of IPv4 problem areas,\
    \ we suspect that there are\n   only two causes which may motivate users to widely\
    \ deploy IPng:\n      (1) If IPng products add critical functionality which IPv4\
    \ can't\n      provide (e.g., real time applications, multimedia applications,\n\
    \      genuine (scalable) plug-and-play networking, etc.), users would be\n  \
    \    motivated to deploy IPng where that functionality is needed.\n      However,\
    \ these deployments must combat the \"Integration Factor\"\n      and the \"Inertia\
    \ Factor\" forces which have previously been\n      described.  This implies that\
    \ there must be a significant business\n      gain to justify such a deployment.\
    \  While it is impossible to\n      predict exactly how this conflict would \"\
    play out\", it is\n      reasonable to assume that IPng would probably be deployed\n\
    \      according to an \"as needed only\" policy.  Optimally, specific\n     \
    \ steps would be taken to protect the remainder of the network from\n      the\
    \ impact of these localized changes.  Of course, should IPng\n      become bundled\
    \ with \"killer applications\" (i.e., applications\n      which are extremely\
    \ important to significantly many key business\n      processes) then all bets\
    \ are off:  IPng will become widely\n      deployed.  However, it also should\
    \ be recognized that virtually\n      all (initial) IPng applications, unless\
    \ they happen to be \"killer\n      applications\", will have to overcome significant\
    \ hurdles to be\n      deployed simply because they represent risk and substantially\n\
    \      increased deployment and support costs for the end user.\n      (2) Should\
    \ IPng foster a convergence between Internet Standards\n      and International\
    \ Standards (i.e., OSI), this convergence could\n      change IPng's destiny.\
    \  That is, the networks of many large\n      corporations are currently being\
    \ driven by sets of strong, but\n      contradictory, requirements:  one set demanding\
    \ compliance with\n      Internet Standards (i.e., TCP/IP) and another set demanding\n\
    \      compliance with International Standards.  This paper assumes that\n   \
    \   the reader is already familiar with the many reasons why end users\n     \
    \ seek to deploy and use Internet Standards.  The following is a\n      partial\
    \ list as to why End Users may be motivated to use\n      International Standards\
    \ (i.e., OSI) as well:\n   A)  World-wide commerce is regulated by governments\
    \ in accordance\n       with their treaties and legal agreements.  World-wide\n\
    \       telecommunications are regulated by the ITU (a United Nations\n      \
    \ chartered/authorized organization).  International Standards\n       (i.e.,\
    \ OSI) are the only government-sanctioned method for\n       commercial data communications.\
    \  Aspects of this picture are\n       currently in the process of changing.\n\
    \   B)  The currently proprietary aeronautical world-wide air-to-ground\n    \
    \   and ground-to-ground communications are being replaced by an\n       OSI-based\
    \ (CLNP) Aeronautical Telecommunications Network (ATN)\n       internet which\
    \ is being built in a number of different national\n       and international forums\
    \ including:\n       *  International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO)\n   \
    \    *  International Air Transport Association (IATA)\n       *  Airlines Electronic\
    \ Engineering Committee (AEEC)\n       \"Civil Aviation Authorities, airlines,\
    \ and private aircraft will\n       use the ATN to convey two major categories\
    \ of data traffic among\n       their computers: Air Traffic Services Communications\
    \ (ATSC) and\n       Aeronautical Industry Services Communication (AISC).\" [Note:\
    \ The\n       data communications of airline passengers are not addressed by\n\
    \       the directive.]\n   C)  A corporation's customers may have data communications\n\
    \       requirements which are levied upon them by the governments in\n      \
    \ which they operate which they, in turn, must support in their\n       own products\
    \ in order to fulfill their customers' needs.  For\n       example, Boeing is\
    \ influenced by existing:\n       * Computer Aided Logistics Support (CALS; i.e.,\
    \ these are GOSIP\n         (OSI)-based) requirements for US Department of Defense\n\
    \         contractors.\n       * Airline requirements emanating from A and B above.\n\
    \   D)  The end user perception that once we have deployed\n       International\
    \ Standards we will not subsequently be compelled to\n       migrate by external\
    \ factors to another technology.  Thus, we\n       would have a \"safe\" foundation\
    \ to concentrate upon our real\n       computing issues such as increased customer\
    \ satisfaction,\n       business process flow-time improvements, legacy system\n\
    \       modernization, and cost avoidance.\n   E)  The proposals of entities desiring\
    \ to obtain contracts with\n       Governments are evaluated on many subjective\
    \ and objective\n       bases.  One of the subjective issues may well be the\n\
    \       \"responsibility\" and \"dependability\" of the bidder company\n     \
    \  including such intangibles as its corporate like-mindedness.\n       For this\
    \ reason, as long as the Government has OSI as their\n       official standard,\
    \ the bidder may have a subjective advantage if\n       its corporate policy also\
    \ includes a similar standard,\n       particularly if data communications services\
    \ are being\n       negotiated.\n   F)  The perception that the need for IPng\
    \ may imply that IPv4 is\n       unfit to be a strategic end user alternative.\
    \  Also, IPng is not\n       a viable deployment option at this time.\n   G) \
    \ Doubts concerning IPv4 scalability (e.g., toasternet: an\n       algorithmic\
    \ change in which currently \"dumb devices\" become\n       intelligent and suddenly\
    \ require Internet connectivity).\n   It currently appears that many of these\
    \ \"OSI motivations\" are\n   undergoing change at this time.  This possibility\
    \ must be tracked\n   with interest.  However, a key point of this section is\
    \ that a\n   corporation must base its data communications decisions upon business\n\
    \   requirements.  That is, corporations exist to sell products and\n   services,\
    \ not to play \"networking games\".\n   Thus, if a means could be found to achieve\
    \ greater synergy\n   (integration/ adoption) between Internet Standards and International\n\
    \   Standards then corporate management may be inclined to mandate\n   internal\
    \ deployment of the merged standards and promote their\n   external use.  Optimally,\
    \ such a synergy should offer the promise of\n   reducing currently deployed protocol\
    \ diversity (i.e., supports the\n   \"Integration Factor\" force).  Depending\
    \ on the specific method by\n   which this convergence is achieved, it may also\
    \ partially offset the\n   previously mentioned \"Inertia Factor\" force, especially\
    \ if IPng\n   proves to be a protocol which has already been deployed.\n"

  - "User-based IPng Requirements\n   From the above one can see that a mandate to\
    \ use IPng to communicate\n   over the Internet does not correspondingly imply\
    \ the need for large\n   corporate networks to generally support IPng within their\
    \ networks.\n   Thus, while the IPv4 scalability limitations are a compelling\
    \ reason\n   to identify a specific IPv4 replacement protocol for the Internet,\n\
    \   other factors are at work within private corporate networks.  These\n   factors\
    \ imply that large TCP/IP end users will have a continuing need\n   to purchase\
    \ IPv4 products even after IPng products have become\n   generally available.\n\
    \   However, since the IETF community is actively engaged in identifying\n   an\
    \ IPng solution, it is desirable that the solution satisfy as many\n   end user\
    \ needs as possible.  For this reason, we would like to\n   suggest that the following\
    \ are important \"user requirements\" for any\n   IPng solution:\n   1)  The IPng\
    \ approach must permit users to slowly transition to IPng\n       in a piecemeal\
    \ fashion.  Even if IPng becomes widely deployed,\n       it is unrealistic to\
    \ expect that users will ever transition all\n       of the extensive IPv4 installed\
    \ base to IPng.  Consequently, the\n       approach must indefinitely support\
    \ corporate-internal\n       communication between IPng hosts and IPv4 hosts regardless\
    \ of\n       the requirements of the world-wide Internet.\n   2)  The IPng approach\
    \ must not hinder technological advances from\n       being implemented.\n   3)\
    \  The IPng approach is expected to eventually foster greater\n       synergy\
    \ (integration/adoption) between Internet Standards and\n       International\
    \ Standards (i.e., OSI).  [Note: This may be\n       accomplished in a variety\
    \ of ways including having the Internet\n       Standards adopted as International\
    \ Standards or else having the\n       International Standards adopted as Internet\
    \ Standards.]\n   4)  The IPng approach should have \"self-defining network\"\
    \ (i.e.,\n       \"plug & play\") capabilities.  That is, large installations\n\
    \       require device portability in which one may readily move devices\n   \
    \    within one's corporate network and have them autoconfigure,\n       autoaddress,\
    \ autoregister, etc.  without explicit human\n       administrative overhead at\
    \ the new location -- assuming that the\n       security criteria of the new location\
    \ have been met.\n   5)  The approach must have network security characteristics\
    \ which are\n       better than existing IPv4 protocols.\n"
- title: Conclusion
  contents:
  - "Conclusion\n   In summary, the key factor which will determine whether -- and\
    \ to\n   what extent -- IPng will be deployed by large end users is whether\n\
    \   IPng will become an essential element for the construction of\n   applications\
    \ which are critically needed by our businesses.  If IPng\n   is bundled with\
    \ applications which satisfy critical business needs,\n   it will be deployed.\
    \  If it isn't, it is of little relevance to the\n   large end user.  Regardless\
    \ of what happens to IPng, the large mass\n   of IPv4 devices will ensure that\
    \ IPv4 will remain an important\n   protocol for the foreseeable future and that\
    \ continued development of\n   IPv4 products is advisable.\n"
