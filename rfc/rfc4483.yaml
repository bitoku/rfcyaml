- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   The purpose of the Session Initiation Protocol [9] (SIP)\
    \ is to\n   create, modify, or terminate sessions with one or more participants.\n\
    \   SIP messages, like HTTP, are syntactically composed of a start line,\n   one\
    \ or more headers, and an optional body.  Unlike HTTP, SIP is not\n   designed\
    \ as a general-purpose data transport protocol.\n   There are numerous reasons\
    \ why it might be desirable to specify the\n   content of the SIP message body\
    \ indirectly.  For bandwidth-limited\n   applications such as cellular wireless,\
    \ indirection provides a means\n   to annotate the (indirect) content with meta-data,\
    \ which may be used\n   by the recipient to determine whether or not to retrieve\
    \ the content\n   over a resource-limited link.\n   It is also possible that the\
    \ content size to be transferred might\n   overwhelm intermediate signaling proxies,\
    \ thereby unnecessarily\n   increasing network latency.  For time-sensitive SIP\
    \ applications,\n   this may be unacceptable.  Indirect content can remedy this\
    \ by moving\n   the transfer of this content out of the SIP signaling network\
    \ and\n   into a potentially separate data transfer channel.\n   There may also\
    \ be scenarios where the session-related data (body)\n   that needs to be conveyed\
    \ does not directly reside on the endpoint or\n   User Agent.  In such scenarios,\
    \ it is desirable to have a mechanism\n   whereby the SIP message can contain\
    \ an indirect reference to the\n   desired content.  The receiving party would\
    \ then use this indirect\n   reference to retrieve the content via a non-SIP transfer\
    \ channel such\n   as HTTP, FTP, or LDAP.\n   The purpose of content indirection\
    \ is purely to provide an\n   alternative transport mechanism for SIP MIME body\
    \ parts.  With the\n   exception of the transport mechanism, indirect body parts\
    \ are\n   equivalent to, and should have the same treatment as, in-line body\n\
    \   parts.\n   Previous attempts at solving the content indirection problem made\
    \ use\n   of the text/uri-list [6] MIME type.  While attractive for its\n   simplicity\
    \ (a list of URIs delimited by end-of-line markers), it\n   failed to satisfy\
    \ a number of the requirements for a more general-\n   purpose content indirection\
    \ mechanism in SIP.  Most notably lacking\n   is the ability to specify various\
    \ attributes on a per-URI basis.\n   These attributes might include version information,\
    \ the MIME type of\n   the referenced content, etc.\n   RFC 2017 defines a strong\
    \ candidate for a replacement for the\n   text/uri-list MIME type.  RFC 2017 [1]\
    \ defines an extension to the\n   message/external-body MIME type originally defined\
    \ in RFC2046 [3].\n   The extension that RFC 2017 makes allows a generic URI to\
    \ specify the\n   location of the content rather than protocol-specific parameters\
    \ for\n   FTP, etc., as originally defined in RFC2046.  Although it provides\n\
    \   most of the functionality needed for a SIP content indirection\n   mechanism,\
    \ RFC 2017 by itself is not a complete solution.  This\n   document specifies\
    \ the usage of RFC 2017 necessary to fulfill the\n   requirements outlined for\
    \ content indirection.\n   The requirements can be classified as applying either\
    \ to the URI,\n   which indirectly references the desired content, or to the content\n\
    \   itself.  Where possible, existing MIME parameters and entity headers\n   are\
    \ used to satisfy those requirements.  MIME (Content-Type)\n   parameters are\
    \ the preferred manner of describing the URI, while\n   entity headers are the\
    \ preferred manner of describing the (indirect)\n   content.  See RFC 2045 [2]\
    \ for a description of most of these entity\n   headers and MIME parameters.\n"

    \ via a URI.\n      Such URIs MUST conform with RFC2396 [7].\n   o  It MUST be\
    \ possible to specify the length of the indirect content.\n   o  It MUST be possible\
    \ to specify the type of the indirect content.\n   o  It MUST be possible to specify\
    \ the disposition of each URI\n      independently.\n   o  It MUST be possible\
    \ to label each URI to identify if and when the\n      content referred to by\
    \ that URI has changed.  Applications of this\n      mechanism may send the same\
    \ URI more than once.  The intention of\n      this requirement is to allow the\

    \ has changed, without\n      having to retrieve that content.  Examples of ways\
    \ the URI could\n      be labeled include a sequence number, timestamp, and version\n\
    \      number.  When used with HTTP, the entity-tag (ETAG) mechanism, as\n   \
    \   defined in RFC2068 [4], may be appropriate.  Note that we are\n      labeling\
    \ not the URI itself but the content to which the URI\n      refers, and that\
    \ the label is therefore effectively \"metadata\" of\n      the content itself.\n\
    \   o  It MUST be possible to specify the time span for which a given URI\n  \
    \    is valid.  This may or may not be the same as the lifetime for the\n    \
    \  content itself.\n   o  It MUST be possible for the UAC and the UAS to indicate\
    \ support of\n      this content indirection mechanism.  A fallback mechanism\
    \ SHOULD\n      be specified in the event that one of the parties is unable to\n\
    \      support content indirection.\n   o  It MUST be possible for the UAC and\
    \ UAS to negotiate the type of\n      the indirect content when using the content\
    \ indirection mechanism.\n   o  It MUST be possible for the UAC and UAS to negotiate\
    \ support for\n      any URI scheme to be used in the content indirection mechanism.\n\
    \      This is in addition to the ability to negotiate the content type.\n   o\
    \  It SHOULD be possible to ensure the integrity and confidentiality\n      of\
    \ the URI when it is received by the remote party.\n   o  It MUST be possible\
    \ to process the content indirection without\n      human intervention.\n   o\
    \  It MUST allow for indirect transference of content in any SIP\n      message\
    \ that would otherwise carry that content as a body.\n"

  - "5.11.  Specifying Multiple URIs for Content Indirection\n   If there is a need\
    \ to send multiple URIs for content indirection, an\n   appropriate multipart\
    \ MIME type [3] should be used.  Each URI MUST be\n   contained in a single entity.\
    \  Indirect content may be mixed with\n   directly-supplied content.  This is\
    \ particularly useful with the\n   multipart/alternative MIME type.\n   NOTE:\
    \ This specification does not change the meanings of the various\n   multipart\
    \ flavors, particularly multipart/related, as described in\n   RFC 2387 [13].\n\
    \   For example:\n           MIME-Version: 1.0\n           Content-Type: multipart/mixed;\
    \ boundary=boundary42\n           --boundary42\n           Content-Type: text/plain;\
    \ charset=us-ascii\n           The company announcement for June, 2002 follows:\n\
    \           --boundary42\n           Content-Type: message/external-body;\n  \
    \              access-type=\"URL\";\n                expiration=\"Mon, 24 June\

    \ wishes the recipient to be able to\n   validate that this content has not been\
    \ altered from that intended by\n   the sender, the sender includes a SHA-1 [8]\
    \ hash of the content.  If\n   it is included, the hash is encoded by extending\
    \ the MIME syntax [3]\n   to include a \"hash\" parameter for the content type\
    \ \"message/\n   external-body\", whose value is a hexadecimal encoding of the\
    \ hash.\n   For example:\n            Content-Type: message/external-body;\n \

    \ [9] defines three headers that supply additional information with\n   regard\
    \ to a session, a particular error response, or alerting.  All\n   three of these\
    \ headers allow the UAC or UAS to indicate additional\n   information through\
    \ a URI.  They may be considered a form of content\n   indirection.  The content\
    \ indirection mechanism defined in this\n   document is not intended as a replacement\
    \ for these headers.  Rather,\n   the headers defined in SIP MUST be used in preference\
    \ to this\n   mechanism, where applicable, because of the well-defined semantics\
    \ of\n   those headers.\n"

- title: 7.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "7.  Security Considerations\n   Any content indirection mechanism introduces\
    \ additional security\n   concerns.  By its nature, content indirection requires\
    \ an extra\n   processing step and information transfer.  There are a number of\n\
    \   potential abuses of a content indirection mechanism:\n   o  Content indirection\
    \ allows the initiator to choose an alternative\n      protocol with weaker security\
    \ or known vulnerabilities for the\n      content transfer (for example, asking\
    \ the recipient to issue an\n      HTTP request that results in a Basic authentication\
    \ challenge).\n   o  Content indirection allows the initiator to ask the recipient\
    \ to\n      consume additional resources in the information transfer and\n   \
    \   content processing, potentially creating an avenue for denial-of-\n      service\
    \ attacks (for example, an active FTP URL consuming 2\n      connections for every\
    \ indirect content message).\n   o  Content indirection could be used as a form\
    \ of port-scanning\n      attack where the indirect content URL is actually a\
    \ bogus URL\n      pointing to an internal resource of the recipient.  The response\n\
    \      to the content indirection request could reveal information about\n   \
    \   open (and vulnerable) ports on these internal resources.\n   o  A content\
    \ indirection URL can disclose sensitive information about\n      the initiator\
    \ such as an internal user name (as part of an HTTP\n      URL) or possibly geolocation\
    \ information.\n   Fortunately, all of these potential threats can be mitigated\
    \ through\n   careful screening of both the indirect content URIs that are received\n\
    \   and those that are sent.  Integrity and confidentiality protection of\n  \
    \ the indirect content URI can prevent additional attacks as well.\n   For confidentiality,\
    \ integrity, and authentication, this content\n   indirection mechanism relies\
    \ on the security mechanisms outlined in\n   RFC 3261.  In particular, the usage\
    \ of S/MIME as defined in section\n   23 of RFC 3261 provides the necessary mechanism\
    \ to ensure integrity,\n   protection, and confidentiality of the indirect content\
    \ URI and\n   associated parameters.\n   Securing the transfer of the indirect\
    \ content is the responsibility\n   of the underlying protocol used for this transfer.\
    \  If HTTP is used,\n   applications implementing this content indirection method\
    \ SHOULD\n   support the HTTPS URI scheme for secure transfer of content and MUST\n\
    \   support the upgrading of connections to TLS, by using starttls.  Note\n  \
    \ that a failure to complete HTTPS or starttls (for example, due to\n   certificate\
    \ or encryption mismatch) after having accepted the\n   indirect content in the\
    \ SIP request is not the same as rejecting the\n   SIP request, and it may require\
    \ additional user-user communication\n   for correction.\n   Note that this document\
    \ does not advocate the use of transitive\n   trust.  That is, just because the\
    \ UAS receives a URI from a UAC that\n   the UAS trusts, the UAS SHOULD NOT implicitly\
    \ trust the object\n   referred to by the URI without establishing its own trust\n\
    \   relationship with the URI provider.\n   Access control to the content referenced\
    \ by the URI is not defined by\n   this specification.  Access control mechanisms\
    \ may be defined by the\n   protocol for the scheme of the indirect content URI.\n\
    \   If the UAC knows the content in advance, the UAC SHOULD include a\n   hash\
    \ parameter in the content indirection.  The hash parameter is a\n   hexadecimal-encoded\
    \ SHA-1 [8] hash of the indirect content.  If a\n   hash value is included, the\
    \ recipient MUST check the indirect content\n   against that hash and indicate\
    \ any mismatch to the user.\n   In addition, if the hash parameter is included\
    \ and the target URI\n   involves setting up a security context using certificates,\
    \ the UAS\n   MUST ignore the results of the certificate validation procedure,\
    \ and\n   instead verify that the hash of the (canonicalized) content received\n\
    \   matches the hash presented in the content-indirection hash parameter.\n  \
    \ If the hash parameter is NOT included, the sender SHOULD use only\n   schemes\
    \ that offer message integrity (such as https:).  When the hash\n   parameter\
    \ is not included and security using certificates is used,\n   the UAS MUST verify\
    \ any server certificates, by using the UAS's list\n   of trusted top-level certificate\
    \ authorities.\n   If hashing of indirect content is not used, the content returned\
    \ to\n   the recipient by exercise of the indirection might have been altered\n\
    \   from that intended by the sender.\n"
