  - "1.  Introduction\n   PANA (Protocol for carrying Authentication for Network Access)\
    \ is a\n   link-layer agnostic network access authentication protocol that runs\n\
    \   between a client that wants to gain access to the network and a\n   server\
    \ on the network side.  PANA defines a new Extensible\n   Authentication Protocol\
    \ (EAP) [RFC3748] lower layer that uses IP\n   between the protocol end points.\n\
    \   The motivation to define such a protocol and the requirements are\n   described\
    \ in [RFC4058].  Protocol details are documented in\n   [RFC5191].  Upon following\
    \ a successful PANA authentication, per-\n   data-packet security can be achieved\
    \ by using physical security,\n   link-layer ciphering, or IPsec [PANA-IPSEC].\
    \  The server\n   implementation of PANA may or may not be colocated with the\
    \ entity\n   enforcing the per-packet access control function.  When the server\n\
    \   for PANA and per-packet access control entities are separate, a\n   protocol\
    \ (e.g., [ANCP-PROTO]) may be used to carry information\n   between the two nodes.\n\
    \   PANA is intended to be used in any access network regardless of the\n   underlying\
    \ security.  For example, the network might be physically\n   secured, or secured\
    \ by means of cryptographic mechanisms after the\n   successful client-network\
    \ authentication.  While it is mandatory for\n   a PANA deployment to implement\
    \ behavior that ensures the integrity of\n   PANA messages when the EAP method\
    \ produces MSK, it is not mandatory\n   to implement support for network security\
    \ at the link-layer or\n   network-layer.\n   This document defines the general\
    \ framework for describing how these\n   various PANA and other network access\
    \ authentication elements\n   interact with each other, especially considering\
    \ the two basic types\n   of deployment environments (see Section 4).\n"

- title: 2.  General PANA Framework
  contents:
  - "2.  General PANA Framework\n   PANA is designed to facilitate the authentication\
    \ and authorization\n   of clients in access networks.  PANA is an EAP [RFC3748]\
    \ lower layer\n   that carries EAP authentication methods encapsulated inside\
    \ EAP\n   between a client node and a server in the access network.  While PANA\n\
    \   enables the authentication process between the two entities, it is\n   only\
    \ a part of an overall AAA (Authentication, Authorization and\n   Accounting)\
    \ and access control framework.  A AAA and access control\n   framework using\
    \ PANA is comprised of four functional entities.\n   Figure 1 illustrates these\
    \ functional entities and the interfaces\n   (protocols, APIs) among them.\n \
    \                                                RADIUS,\n                   \

    \   PANA Client (PaC):\n      The PaC is the client implementation of PANA.  This\
    \ entity resides\n      on the node that is requesting network access.  PaCs can\
    \ be end\n      hosts, such as laptops, PDAs, cell phones, desktop PCs, or routers\n\
    \      that are connected to a network via a wired or wireless interface.\n  \
    \    A PaC is responsible for requesting network access and engaging in\n    \
    \  the authentication process using PANA.\n   PANA Authentication Agent (PAA):\n\
    \      The PAA is the server implementation of PANA.  A PAA is in charge\n   \
    \   of interfacing with the PaCs for authenticating and authorizing\n      them\
    \ for the network access service.\n      The PAA consults an authentication server\
    \ in order to verify the\n      credentials and rights of a PaC.  If the authentication\
    \ server\n      resides on the same node as the PAA, an API is sufficient for\
    \ this\n      interaction.  When they are separated (a much more common case in\n\
    \      public access networks), a protocol needs to run between the two.\n   \
    \   AAA protocols like RADIUS [RFC2865] and Diameter [RFC3588] are\n      commonly\
    \ used for this purpose.\n      The PAA is also responsible for updating the access\
    \ control state\n      (i.e., filters) depending on the creation and deletion\
    \ of the\n      authorization state.  The PAA communicates the updated state to\n\
    \      the Enforcement Points (EPs) in the network.  If the PAA and EP\n     \
    \ are residing on the same node, an API is sufficient for this\n      communication.\
    \  Otherwise, a protocol is required to carry the\n      authorized client attributes\
    \ from the PAA to the EP.\n      The PAA resides on a node that is typically called\
    \ a NAS (network\n      access server) in the access network.  For example, on\
    \ a BRAS\n      (Broadband Remote Access Server) [DSL] in DSL networks, or PDSN\n\
    \      (Packet Data Serving Node) [3GPP2] in 3GPP2 networks.  The PAA may\n  \
    \    be one or more IP hops away from the PaCs.\n   Authentication Server (AS):\n\
    \      The server implementation that is in charge of verifying the\n      credentials\
    \ of a PaC that is requesting the network access\n      service.  The AS receives\
    \ requests from the PAA on behalf of the\n      PaCs, and responds with the result\
    \ of verification together with\n      the authorization parameters (e.g., allowed\
    \ bandwidth, IP\n      configuration, etc).  This is the server that terminates\
    \ the EAP\n      and the EAP methods.  The AS might be hosted on the same node\
    \ as\n      the PAA, on a dedicated node on the access network, or on a\n    \
    \  central server somewhere in the Internet.\n   Enforcement Point (EP):\n   \
    \   The access control implementation that is in charge of allowing\n      access\
    \ (data traffic) of authorized clients while preventing\n      access by others.\
    \  An EP learns the attributes of the authorized\n      clients from the PAA.\n\
    \      The EP uses non-cryptographic or cryptographic filters to\n      selectively\
    \ allow and discard data packets.  These filters may be\n      applied at the\
    \ link layer or the IP layer [PANA-IPSEC].  When\n      cryptographic access control\
    \ is used, a secure association\n      protocol [RFC3748] needs to run between\
    \ the PaC and EP.  After\n      completion of the secure association protocol,\
    \ link- or network-\n      layer per-packet security (for example TKIP, IPsec\
    \ ESP) is enabled\n      for integrity protection, data origin authentication,\
    \ replay\n      protection, and optionally confidentiality protection.\n     \
    \ An EP is located between the access network (the topology within\n      reach\
    \ of any client) and the accessed network (the topology within\n      reach of\
    \ only authorized clients).  It must be located\n      strategically in a local\
    \ area network to minimize the access of\n      unauthorized clients.  It is recommended\
    \ but not mandated that the\n      EP be on the path between the PaC and the PAA\
    \ for the\n      aforementioned reason.  For example, the EP can be hosted on\
    \ the\n      switch that is directly connected to the clients in a wired\n   \
    \   network.  That way the EP can drop unauthorized packets before\n      they\
    \ reach any other client node or nodes beyond the local area\n      network.\n\
    \   Some of the entities may be colocated depending on the deployment\n   scenario.\
    \  For example, the PAA and EP would be on the same node\n   (BRAS) in DSL networks.\
    \  In that case, a simple API is sufficient\n   between the PAA and EP.  In small\
    \ enterprise deployments, the PAA and\n   AS may be hosted on the same node (access\
    \ router) that eliminates the\n   need for a protocol run between the two.  The\
    \ decision to colocate\n   these entities or otherwise, and their precise location\
    \ in the\n   network topology, are deployment decisions that are out of the scope\n\
    \   of this document.\n"

    \                |\n                       Figure 2: PANA Signaling Flow\n   The\
    \ EP on the access network allows general data traffic from any\n   authorized\
    \ PaC, whereas it allows only a limited type of traffic\n   (e.g., PANA, DHCP,\
    \ router discovery, etc.) for the unauthorized PaCs.\n   This ensures that the\
    \ newly attached clients have the minimum access\n   service to engage in PANA\
    \ and get authorized for the unlimited\n   service.\n   The PaC dynamically or\
    \ statically configures an IP address prior to\n   running PANA.  After the successful\
    \ PANA authentication, depending on\n   the deployment scenario, the PaC may need\
    \ to re-configure its IP\n   address or configure additional IP address(es). \
    \ For example, a\n   link-local IPv6 address may be used for PANA and the PaC\
    \ may be\n   allowed to configure additional global IPv6 address(es) upon\n  \
    \ successful authentication.  Another example: A PaC may be limited to\n   using\
    \ an IPv4 link-local address during PANA, and allowed to\n   reconfigure its interface\
    \ with a non-link-local IPv4 address after\n   the authentication.  General-purpose\
    \ applications cannot use the\n   interface until PANA authentication succeeds\
    \ and appropriate IP\n   address configuration takes place.\n   An initially unauthorized\
    \ PaC starts PANA authentication by\n   discovering the PAA, followed by the EAP\
    \ exchange over PANA.  The PAA\n   interacts with the AS during this process.\
    \  Upon receiving the\n   authentication and authorization result from the AS,\
    \ the PAA informs\n   the PaC about the result of its network access request.\n\
    \   If the PaC is authorized to gain access to the network, the PAA also\n   sends\
    \ the PaC-specific attributes (e.g., IP address, cryptographic\n   keys, etc.)\
    \ to the EP by using another protocol.  The EP uses this\n   information to alter\
    \ its filters to allow data traffic from and to\n   the PaC to pass through.\n\
    \   In case cryptographic access control needs to be enabled after PANA\n   authentication,\
    \ a secure association protocol runs between the PaC\n   and the EP.  Dynamic\
    \ parameters required for that protocol (e.g.,\n   endpoint identity, shared secret)\
    \ are derived from successful PANA\n   authentication; these parameters are used\
    \ to authenticate the PaC to\n   the EP and vice-versa as part of creating the\
    \ security association.\n   For example, see [PANA-IPSEC] for how it is done for\
    \ IKE [RFC2409]\n   [RFC4306] based on using a key-generating EAP method for PANA\
    \ between\n   the PaC and PAA.  The secure association protocol exchange produces\n\
    \   the required security associations between the PaC and the EP to\n   enable\
    \ cryptographic data traffic protection.  Per-packet\n   cryptographic data traffic\
    \ protection introduces additional per-\n   packet overhead but the overhead exists\
    \ only between the PaC and EP\n   and will not affect communications beyond the\
    \ EP.\n   Finally, filters that are installed at the EP allow general purpose\n\
    \   data traffic to flow between the PaC and the intranet/Internet.\n"
- title: 4.  Environments
  contents:
  - "4.  Environments\n   PANA can be used on any network environment whether there\
    \ is a\n   lower-layer secure channel between the PaC and the EP prior to PANA,\n\
    \   or one has to be enabled upon successful PANA authentication.\n   With regard\
    \ to network access authentication, two types of networks\n   need to be considered:\n\
    \   a. Networks where a secure channel is already available prior to\n      running\
    \ PANA\n      This type of network is characterized by the existence of\n    \
    \  protection against spoofing and eavesdropping.  Nevertheless, user\n      authentication\
    \ and authorization is required for network\n      connectivity.\n      a.1. One\
    \ example is a DSL network where lower-layer security is\n           provided\
    \ by a physical means.  Physical protection of the\n           network wiring\
    \ ensures that practically there is only one\n           client that can send\
    \ and receive IP packets on the link.\n      a.2. Another example is a cdma2000\
    \ network where the lower-layer\n           security is provided by means of cryptographic\
    \ protection.\n           By the time the client requests access to the network-layer\n\
    \           services, it is already authenticated and authorized for\n       \
    \    accessing the radio channel, and link-layer ciphering is\n           enabled.\n\
    \      The presence of a secure channel before the PANA exchange\n      eliminates\
    \ the need for executing a secure association protocol\n      after PANA.  The\
    \ PANA session can be associated with the\n      communication channel it was\
    \ carried over.  Also, the choice of\n      EAP authentication method depends\
    \ on the presence of this security\n      while PANA is running.\n   b. Networks\
    \ where a secure channel is created after running PANA\n      These are the networks\
    \ where there is no lower-layer protection\n      prior to running PANA.  Successful\
    \ PANA authentication enables the\n      generation of cryptographic keys that\
    \ are used with a secure\n      association protocol to enable per-packet cryptographic\n\
    \      protection.\n      PANA authentication is run on an insecure channel that\
    \ is\n      vulnerable to eavesdropping and spoofing.  The choice of EAP\n   \
    \   method must be resilient to the possible attacks associated with\n      such\
    \ an environment.  Furthermore, the EAP method must be able to\n      create cryptographic\
    \ keys that will later be used by the secure\n      association protocol.\n  \
    \    Whether to use\n      b.1. link-layer per-packet security or\n      b.2.\
    \ network-layer per-packet security\n      is a deployment decision and outside\
    \ the scope of this document.\n      This decision also dictates the choice of\
    \ the secure association\n      protocol.  If link-layer protection is used, the\
    \ protocol would be\n      link-layer specific.  If IP-layer protection is used,\
    \ the secure\n      association protocol would be IKE and the per-packet security\n\
    \      would be provided by IPsec AH/ESP regardless of the underlying\n      link-layer\
    \ technology.\n"
