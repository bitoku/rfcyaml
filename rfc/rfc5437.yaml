- title: 1.1.  Overview
  contents:
  - "1.1.  Overview\n   The [NOTIFY] extension to the [SIEVE] mail filtering language\
    \ is a\n   framework for providing notifications by employing URIs to specify\n\
    \   the notification mechanism.  This document defines how xmpp URIs (see\n  \
    \ [XMPP-URI]) are used to generate notifications via the Extensible\n   Messaging\
    \ and Presence Protocol [XMPP], which is widely implemented\n   in Jabber instant\
    \ messaging technologies.\n"
- title: 1.2.  Terminology
  contents:
  - "1.2.  Terminology\n   This document inherits terminology from [NOTIFY], [SIEVE],\
    \ and\n   [XMPP].  In particular, the terms \"parameter\" and \"tag\" are used\
    \ as\n   described in [NOTIFY] to refer to aspects of Sieve scripts, and the\n\
    \   term \"key\" is used as described in [XMPP-URI] to refer to aspects of\n \
    \  an XMPP URI.\n   The capitalized key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\"\
    , \"SHALL\",\n   \"SHALL NOT\", \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"\
    NOT\n   RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in this document are to be\n\
    \   interpreted as described in [TERMS].\n"

- title: 2.7.  XMPP Syntax
  contents:
  - "2.7.  XMPP Syntax\n   The xmpp mechanism results in the sending of an XMPP message\
    \ to\n   notify a recipient about an email message.  The general XMPP syntax\n\
    \   is as follows:\n   o  The notification MUST be an XMPP <message/> stanza.\n\
    \   o  The value of the XMPP 'from' attribute SHOULD be the XMPP address\n   \
    \   of the notification service associated with the Sieve engine or\n      the\
    \ XMPP address of the entity to be notified.  The value of the\n      XMPP 'from'\
    \ attribute MUST NOT be generated from the Sieve \":from\"\n      tag.\n   o \
    \ The value of the XMPP 'to' attribute MUST be the XMPP address\n      specified\
    \ in the XMPP URI contained in the \"method\" notify\n      parameter.\n   o \
    \ The value of the XMPP 'type' attribute MUST be 'headline' or\n      'normal'.\n\
    \   o  The XMPP <message/> stanza MUST include a <body/> child element.\n    \
    \  If the \":message\" tag is included in the Sieve script, that string\n    \
    \  MUST be used as the XML character data of the <body/> element.  If\n      not\
    \ and if the XMPP URI contained in the \"method\" notify parameter\n      specified\
    \ a \"body\" key in the query component, that value SHOULD\n      be used.  Otherwise,\
    \ the XML character data SHOULD be some\n      configurable text indicating that\
    \ the message is a Sieve\n      notification.\n   o  The XMPP <message/> stanza\
    \ MAY include a <subject/> child element.\n      If the XMPP URI contained in\
    \ the \"method\" notify parameter\n      specified a \"subject\" key in the query\
    \ component, that value\n      SHOULD be used as the XML character data of the\
    \ <subject/>\n      element.  Otherwise, the XML character data SHOULD be some\n\
    \      configurable text indicating that the message is a Sieve\n      notification.\n\
    \   o  The XMPP <message/> stanza SHOULD include a URI, for the recipient\n  \
    \    to use as a hint in locating the message, encapsulated as the XML\n     \
    \ character data of a <url/> child element of an <x/> element\n      qualified\
    \ by the 'jabber:x:oob' namespace, as specified in [OOB].\n      If included,\
    \ the URI SHOULD be an Internet Message Access Protocol\n      [IMAP] URL that\
    \ specifies the location of the message, as defined\n      in [IMAP-URL], but\
    \ MAY be another URI type that can specify or\n      hint at the location of an\
    \ email message, such as a URI for an\n      HTTP resource [HTTP] or a Post Office\
    \ Protocol Version 3 (POP3)\n      mailbox [POP-URL] at which the message can\
    \ be accessed.  It is not\n      expected that an XMPP user agent shall directly\
    \ handle such a URI,\n      but instead that it shall invoke an appropriate helper\
    \ application\n      to handle the URI.\n   o  The XMPP <message/> stanza MAY\
    \ include an XMPP SHIM (Stanza\n      Headers and Internet Metadata) [SHIM] header\
    \ named \"Resent-From\".\n      If the Sieve script included a \":from\" tag,\
    \ the \"Resent-From\"\n      value MUST be the value of the \":from\" tag; otherwise,\
    \ the\n      \"Resent-From\" value SHOULD be the envelope recipient address of\n\
    \      the original email message that triggered the notification.\n"
- title: 3.  Examples
  contents:
  - "3.  Examples\n   In the following examples, the sender of the email has an address\
    \ of\n   <mailto:juliet@example.org>, the entity to be notified has an email\n\
    \   address of <mailto:romeo@example.com> and an XMPP address of\n   romeo@im.example.com\
    \ (resulting in an XMPP URI of\n   <xmpp:romeo@im.example.com>), and the notification\

- title: 4.  Requirements Conformance
  contents:
  - "4.  Requirements Conformance\n   Section 3.8 of [NOTIFY] specifies a set of requirements\
    \ for Sieve\n   notification methods.  The conformance of the xmpp notification\n\
    \   mechanism is provided here.\n   1.   An implementation of the xmpp notification\
    \ method SHOULD NOT\n        modify the final notification text (e.g., to limit\
    \ the length);\n        however, a given deployment MAY do so (e.g., if recipients\
    \ pay\n        per character or byte for XMPP messages).  Modification of\n  \
    \      characters themselves should not be necessary, since XMPP\n        character\
    \ data is encoded in [UTF-8].\n   2.   An implementation MAY ignore parameters\
    \ specified in the\n        \":from\", \":importance\", and \":options\" tags.\n\
    \   3.   There is no recommended default message for an implementation to\n  \
    \      include if the \":message\" tag is not specified.\n   4.   A notification\
    \ sent via the xmpp notification method MAY include\n        a timestamp in the\
    \ textual message.\n   5.   The value of the XMPP 'from' attribute MUST be the\
    \ XMPP address\n        of the notification service associated with the Sieve\
    \ engine.\n        The value of the Sieve \":from\" tag MAY be transformed into\
    \ the\n        value of an XMPP SHIM (Stanza Headers and Internet Metadata)\n\
    \        [SHIM] header named \"Resent-From\".\n   6.   The value of the XMPP 'to'\
    \ attribute MUST be the XMPP address\n        specified in the XMPP URI contained\
    \ in the \"method\" parameter.\n   7.   In accordance with [XMPP-URI], an implementation\
    \ MUST ignore any\n        URI action or key it does not understand (i.e., the\
    \ URI MUST be\n        processed as if the action or key were not present).  It\
    \ is\n        RECOMMENDED to support the XMPP \"message\" query type (see\n  \
    \      [QUERIES]) and the associated \"body\" and \"subject\" keys, which\n  \
    \      SHOULD be mapped to the XMPP <body/> and <subject/> child\n        elements\
    \ of the XMPP <message/> stanza, respectively.  However,\n        if included,\

    \ element, overriding the \"body\" key (if any)\n        included in the XMPP\
    \ URI.\n   8.   An implementation MUST NOT include any other extraneous\n    \
    \    information not specified in parameters to the notify action.\n   9.   In\
    \ response to a notify_method_capability test for the \"online\"\n        notification-capability,\
    \ an implementation SHOULD return a value\n        of \"yes\" if it has knowledge\
    \ of an active presence session (see\n        [XMPP-IM]) for the specified XMPP\
    \ notification-uri, but only if\n        the entity that requested the test is\
    \ authorized to know the\n        presence of the associated XMPP entity (e.g.,\
    \ via explicit\n        presence subscription as specified in [XMPP-IM]); otherwise,\
    \ it\n        SHOULD return a value of \"maybe\" (since typical XMPP systems may\n\
    \        not allow a Sieve engine to gain knowledge about the presence of\n  \
    \      XMPP entities).\n   10.  An implementation SHOULD NOT attempt to retry\
    \ delivery of a\n        notification if it receives an XMPP error of type \"\

  - "5.  Internationalization Considerations\n   Although an XMPP address may contain\
    \ nearly any [UNICODE] character,\n   the value of the \"method\" parameter MUST\
    \ be a Uniform Resource\n   Identifier (see [URI]) rather than an Internationalized\
    \ Resource\n   Identifier (see [IRI]).  The rules specified in [XMPP-URI] MUST\
    \ be\n   followed when generating XMPP URIs.\n   In accordance with Section 13\
    \ of RFC 3920, all data sent over XMPP\n   MUST be encoded in [UTF-8].\n"
- title: 6.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "6.  Security Considerations\n   Depending on the information included, sending\
    \ a notification can be\n   comparable to forwarding mail to the notification\
    \ recipient.  Care\n   must be taken when forwarding mail automatically, to ensure\
    \ that\n   confidential information is not sent into an insecure environment.\n\
    \   In particular, implementations MUST conform to the security\n   considerations\
    \ given in [NOTIFY], [SIEVE], and [XMPP].\n   [NOTIFY] specifies that a notification\
    \ method MUST provide mechanisms\n   for avoiding notification loops.  One type\
    \ of notification loop can\n   be caused by message forwarding; however, such\
    \ loops are prevented\n   because XMPP does not support the forwarding of messages\
    \ from one\n   XMPP address to another.  Another type of notification loop can\
    \ be\n   caused by auto-replies to XMPP messages received by the XMPP\n   notification\
    \ service associated with the Sieve engine; therefore,\n   such a service MUST\
    \ NOT auto-reply to XMPP messages it receives.\n   A common use case might be\
    \ for a user to create a script that enables\n   the Sieve engine to act differently\
    \ if the user is currently\n   available at a particular type of service (e.g.,\
    \ send notifications\n   to the user's XMPP address if the user has an active\
    \ session at an\n   XMPP service).  Whether the user is currently available can\
    \ be\n   determined by means of a notify_method_capability test for the\n   \"\
    online\" notification-capability.  In XMPP, information about current\n   network\
    \ availability is called \"presence\" (see also [MODEL]).  Since\n   [XMPP-IM]\
    \ requires that a user must approve a presence subscription\n   before an entity\
    \ can gain access to the user's presence information,\n   a limited but reasonably\
    \ safe implementation might be for the Sieve\n   engine to request a subscription\
    \ to the user's presence.  The user\n   would then need to approve that subscription\
    \ request so that the\n   Sieve engine can act appropriately depending on whether\
    \ the user is\n   online or offline.  However, the Sieve engine MUST NOT use the\
    \ user's\n   presence information when processing scripts on behalf of a script\n\
    \   owner other than the user, unless the Sieve engine has explicit\n   knowledge\
    \ (e.g., via integration with an XMPP server's presence\n   authorization rules)\
    \ that the script owner is authorized to know the\n   user's presence.  While\
    \ it would be possible to design a more\n   advanced approach to the delegation\
    \ of presence authorization, any\n   such approach is left to future standards\
    \ work.\n"
