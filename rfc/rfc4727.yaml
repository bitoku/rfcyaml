- title: Abstract
  contents:
  - "Abstract\n   When experimenting with or extending protocols, it is often necessary\n\
    \   to use some sort of protocol number or constant in order to actually\n   test\
    \ or experiment with the new function, even when testing in a\n   closed environment.\
    \  This document reserves some ranges of numbers\n   for experimentation purposes\
    \ in specific protocols where the need to\n   support experimentation has been\
    \ identified, and it describes the\n   numbers that have already been reserved\
    \ by other documents.\n"
- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   [RFC3692] recommends assigning option numbers for experiments\
    \ and\n   testing.  This document documents several such assignments for the\n\
    \   number spaces whose IANA considerations are documented in [RFC2780].\n   This\
    \ document generally follows the form of [RFC2780].\n   When using these values,\
    \ carefully consider the advice in Sections 1\n   and 1.1 of [RFC3692].  It is\
    \ not appropriate to simply select one of\n   these values and hard code it into\
    \ a system.\n   Note: while [RFC3692] says that it may not be necessary to allocate\n\
    \   values for UDP and TCP ports, Sections 6 and 7.1 explicitly reserve\n   ports\
    \ for this purpose to avoid any possible conflict.\n"

- title: 9.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "9.  Security Considerations\n   Production networks do not necessarily support\
    \ the use of\n   experimental code points in IP headers.  The network scope of\
    \ support\n   for experimental values should carefully be evaluated before\n \
    \  deploying any experiment across extended network domains, such as the\n   public\
    \ Internet.  The potential to disrupt the stable operation of\n   the network\
    \ hosting the experiment through the use of unsupported\n   experimental code\
    \ points is a serious consideration when planning an\n   experiment using such\
    \ code points.\n   Security analyzers such as firewalls and network intrusion\
    \ detection\n   monitors often rely on unambiguous interpretations of the fields\n\
    \   described in this memo.  As new values for the fields are assigned,\n   existing\
    \ security analyzers that do not understand the new values may\n   fail, resulting\
    \ in either loss of connectivity, if the analyzer\n   declines to forward the\
    \ unrecognized traffic, or in loss of security\n   if it does forward the traffic\
    \ and the new values are used as part of\n   an attack.  Assigning known values\
    \ for experiments can allow such\n   analyzers to take a known action for explicitly\
    \ experimental traffic.\n   Because the experimental IPv4 options defined in Section\
    \ 2.5 are not\n   included in the IPsec AH [RFC4302] calculations, it is not possible\n\
    \   for one to authenticate their use.  Experimenters ought to keep this\n   in\
    \ mind when designing their experiments.  Users of the experimental\n   IPv6 options\
    \ defined in Section 3.5 can choose whether or not the\n   option is included\
    \ in the AH calculations by choosing the value of\n   the \"chg\" field.\n   When\
    \ experimental code points are deployed within an administratively\n   self-contained\
    \ network domain, the network administrators should\n   ensure that each code\
    \ point is used consistently to avoid\n   interference between experiments.  When\
    \ experimental code points are\n   used in traffic that crosses multiple administrative\
    \ domains, the\n   experimenters should assume that there is a risk that the same\
    \ code\n   points will be used simultaneously by other experiments and thus that\n\
    \   there is a possibility that the experiments will interfere.\n   Particular\
    \ attention should be given to security threats that such\n   interference might\
    \ create.\n"
