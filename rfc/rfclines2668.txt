Abstract This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB) for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
This memo obsoletes RFC 2239, "Definitions of Managed Objects for IEEE 802.3 Medium Attachment Units (MAUs) using SMIv2".
This memo extends that specification by including management information useful for the management of 1000 Mb/s MAUs.
Ethernet technology, as defined by the 802.3 Working Group of the IEEE, continues to evolve, with scalable increases in speed, new types of cabling and interfaces, and new features.
This evolution may require changes in the managed objects in order to reflect this new functionality.
This document, as with other documents issued by this working group, reflects a certain stage in the evolution of Ethernet technology.
In the future, this document might be revised, or new documents might be issued by the Ethernet Interfaces and Hub MIB Working Group, in order to reflect the evolution of Ethernet technology.
This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB) for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
In particular, it defines objects for managing IEEE 802.3 Medium Attachment Units (MAUs).
This memo also includes a MIB module.
This MIB module extends the list of managed objects specified in the earlier version of this MIB: RFC 2239 [21].
The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [20].
The SNMP Management Framework presently consists of five major components:   An overall architecture, described in RFC 2571 [1].
Mechanisms for describing and naming objects and events for the purpose of management.
The first version of this Structure of Management Information (SMI) is called SMIv1 and described in STD 16, RFC 1155 [2], STD 16, RFC 1212 [3] and RFC 1215 [4].
The second version, called SMIv2, is described in STD 58, RFC 2578 [5], STD 58, RFC 2579 [6] and STD 58, RFC 2580 [7].
Message protocols for transferring management information.
The first version of the SNMP message protocol is called SNMPv1 and described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [8].
A second version of the SNMP message protocol, which is not an Internet standards track protocol, is called SNMPv2c and described in RFC 1901 [9] and RFC 1906 [10].
The third version of the message protocol is called SNMPv3 and described in RFC 1906 [10], RFC 2572 [11] and RFC 2574 [12].
Protocol operations for accessing management information.
The first set of protocol operations and associated PDU formats is described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [8].
A second set of protocol operations and associated PDU formats is described in RFC 1905 [13].
A set of fundamental applications described in RFC 2573 [14] and the view based access control mechanism described in RFC 2575 [15].
Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed the Management Information Base or MIB.
Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the SMI.
This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2.
A MIB conforming to the SMIv1 can be produced through the appropriate translations.
The resulting translated MIB must be semantically equivalent, except where objects or events are omitted because no translation is possible (use of Counter64).
Some machine readable information in SMIv2 will be converted into textual descriptions in SMIv1 during the translation process.
However, this loss of machine readable information is not considered to change the semantics of the MIB.
This MIB is intended to be a superset of that defined by RFC 2239 [21], which will go to historic status.
This MIB includes all of the objects contained in that MIB, plus several new ones which provide additional capabilities.
Implementors are encouraged to support all applicable conformance groups in order to make the best use of the new functionality provided by this MIB.
Relationship to RFC 1515 RFC 2239 was a replacement for RFC 1515 [22], which is now historic.
RFC 2239 defined a superset of RFC 1515 which contained all of the objects defined in RFC 1515, plus several new ones which provided additional capabilities.
MAU Management Instances of these object types represent attributes of an IEEE 802.3 MAU.
Several types of MAUs are defined in the IEEE 802.3 CSMA/CD standard [16].
These MAUs may be connected to IEEE 802.3 repeaters or to 802.3 (Ethernet like) interfaces.
For convenience this document refers to these devices as "repeater MAUs" and "interface MAUs.
" The definitions presented here are based on Section 30.5, "Layer Management for 10, 100 & 1000 Mb/s Medium Attachment Units (MAUs)", and Annex 30A, "GDMO Specifications for 802.3 managed object classes" of IEEE Std.
That specification includes definitions for 10Mb/s, 100Mb/s and 1000Mb/s devices.
This specification is intended to serve the same purpose: to provide for management of all types of Ethernet/802.3 MAUs.
It is assumed that an agent implementing this MIB will also implement (at least)
the 'system' group defined in MIB II [18].
The following sections identify other MIBs that such an agent should implement.
Relationship to the Interfaces MIB.
The sections of this document that define interface
MAU related objects specify an extension to the Interfaces MIB [19].
An agent implementing these interface MAU related objects MUST also implement the relevant groups of Interface MIB.
The value of the object ifMauIfIndex is the same as the value of 'ifIndex' used to instantiate the interface to which the given MAU is connected.
It is expected that an agent implementing the interface MAU related objects in this MIB will also implement the Ethernet like Interfaces MIB, [23].
(Note that repeater ports are not represented as interfaces in the Interface MIB.)
Relationship to the 802.3 Repeater MIB
The section of this document that defines repeater MAU related objects specifies an extension to the 802.3 Repeater MIB defined in [17].
An agent implementing these repeater MAU related objects MUST also implement the 802.3 Repeater MIB.
The values of 'rpMauGroupIndex' and 'rpMauPortIndex' used to instantiate a repeater MAU variable SHALL be the same as the values of 'rptrPortGroupIndex' and 'rptrPortIndex' used to instantiate the port to which the given MAU is connected.
In some situations, a MAU can be "internal"   i.e., its functionality is implemented entirely within a device.
For example, a managed repeater may contain an internal repeater MAU and/or an internal interface MAU through which management communications originating on one of the repeater's external ports pass in order to reach the management agent associated with the repeater.
Such internal MAUs may or may not be managed.
If they are managed, objects describing their attributes should appear in the appropriate MIB subtree:  dot3RpMauBasicGroup for internal repeater MAUs and dot3IfMauBasicGroup for internal interface MAUs.

The current state of the MAU.
This object MAY be implemented as a read only object by those agents and MAUs that do not implement software control of the MAU state.
Some agents may not support setting the value of this object to some of the enumerated values.
The value other(1) is returned if the MAU is in a state other than one of the states 2 through 6.
The value unknown(2) is returned when the MAU's true state is unknown; for example, when it is being initialized.
A MAU in the operational(3) state is fully functional, operates, and passes signals to its attached DTE or repeater port in accordance to its specification.
state forces DI and CI to idle and the media transmitter to idle or fault, if supported.
) mode only applies to link type MAUs.
The state of rpMauMediaAvailable is unaffected.
state assumes the same condition on DI, CI, and the media transmitter as though it were powered down or not connected.
The MAU MAY return other(1) value for the rpMauJabberState and rpMauMediaAvailable objects when it is in this state.
For an AUI, this state will remove power from the AUI.
Setting this variable to the value reset(6) resets the MAU in the same manner as a power off, power on cycle of at least one half second would.
The agent is not required to return the value reset (6).
Setting this variable to the value operational(3), standby(4), or shutdown(5) causes the MAU to assume the respective state except that setting a mixing type MAU or an AUI to standby(4) will cause the MAU to enter the shutdown state.
30.5.1.1.7, aMAUAdminState, 30.5.1.2.2, acMAUAdminControl, and 30.5.1.2.1, acResetMAU."
"If the MAU is a link or fiber type (FOIRL, 10BASE T, 10BASE F) then this is equivalent to the link test fail state/low light function.
For an AUI or a coax (including broadband) MAU this indicates whether or not loopback is detected on the DI circuit.
The value of this attribute persists between packets for MAU types AUI, 10BASE5, 10BASE2, 10BROAD36, and 10BASE FP.
The value other(1) is returned if the mediaAvailable state is not one of 2 through 11.
The value unknown(2) is returned when the MAU's true state is unknown; for example, when it is being initialized.
At power up or following a reset, the value of this attribute will be unknown for AUI, coax, and 10BASE FP MAUs.
For these MAUs loopback will be tested on each transmission during which no collision is detected.
If DI is receiving input when DO returns to IDL after a transmission and there has been no collision during the transmission then loopback will be detected.
The value of this attribute will only change during non collided transmissions for AUI, coax, and 10BASE FP MAUs.
For 100Mbps and 1000Mbps MAUs, the enumerations match the states within the respective link integrity state diagrams, fig 32 16, 23 12 and 24 15 of sections 32, 23 and 24 of [16].
Any MAU which implements management of auto negotiation will map remote fault indication to remote fault.
The value available(3) indicates that the link, light, or loopback is normal.
The value notAvailable(4) indicates link loss, low light, or no loopback.
The value remoteFault(5) indicates that a fault has been detected at the remote end of the link.
This value applies to 10BASE FB, 100BASE T4 Far End Fault Indication and non specified remote faults from a system running auto negotiation.
The values remoteJabber(7), remoteLinkLoss(8), and remoteTest(9) SHOULD be used instead of remoteFault(5)
where the reason for remote fault is identified in the remote signaling protocol.
The value invalidSignal(6) indicates that an invalid signal has been received from the other end of the link.
InvalidSignal(6) applies only to MAUs of type 10BASE FB.
Where an IEEE Std 802.3u
22 MII is present, a logic one in the remote fault bit (reference section 22.2.4.2.8 of that document)
maps to the value remoteFault(5), and a logic zero in the link status bit (reference section 22.2.4.2.10 of that document
) maps to the value notAvailable(4).
The value notAvailable(4) takes precedence over the value remoteFault(5).
Any MAU that implements management of clause 37
Auto Negotiation will map the received Remote Fault (RF1 and RF2) bit values for Offline to offline(10), Link Failure to remoteFault(5) and Auto Negotiation Error to autoNegError(11).

The agent MUST always return other(1) for MAU type dot3MauTypeAUI.
The value unknown(2) is returned when the MAU's true state is unknown; for example, when it is being initialized.

There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB that have a MAX ACCESS clause of read write.
Setting these objects can have a serious effect on the operation of the network, including: enabling or disabling a MAU changing a MAU's default type enabling, disabling or restarting autonegotiation modifying the capabilities that a MAU advertizes during autonegotiation.
Such objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.
The support for SET operations in a non secure environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on network operations.
by itself is such an insecure environment.
Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec), even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is allowed to access and
the objects in this MIB.
It is recommended that the implementers consider the security features as provided by the SNMPv3 framework.
Specifically, the use of the User based Security Model RFC 2574 [12] and the View based Access Control Model RFC 2575
It is then a customer/user responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an instance of this MIB, is properly configured to give access to those objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate rights to access them.
This section enumerates the changes made to RFC 2239 to produce this document.
The MODULE IDENTITY has been updated to reflect the changes in the MIB.
(2)   OBJECT IDENTITY definitions have been added for gigabit MAU types.
The ifMauTypeList, ifMauAutoNegCapability, ifMauAutoNegCapAdvertised and ifMauAutoNegCapReceived objects have been deprecated and replaced by ifMauTypeListBits, ifMauAutoNegCapabilityBits, ifMauAutoNegCapAdvertisedBits and ifMauAutoNegCapReceivedBits.
(4)   Two new objects, ifMauAutoNegRemoteFaultAdvertised and ifMauAutoNegRemoteFaultReceived have been added.
Enumerations for 'offline' and 'autoNegError' have been added for the rpMauMediaAvailable and ifMauMediaAvailable objects.
The broadMauBasicTable and mauBroadBasic object group have been deprecated.
The mauIfGrp100Mbs and mauIfGrpAutoNeg object groups have been deprecated and replaced by mauIfGrpHighCapacity and mauIfGrpAutoNeg2.
A new object group, mauIfGrpAutoNeg1000Mbps, has been added.
The mauModIfCompl and mauModRpCompl compliances have been deprecated and replaced by mauModIfCompl2 and mauModRpCompl2.
(10)  Added section on relationship to RFC 2239.
(11)  Updated the SNMP Network Management Framework boilerplate.
(12)  Refer to the Interfaces MIB, rather than the interfaces group of MIB II.
(13)  Updated references to refer to latest edition of IEEE 802.3.
An intellectual property notice was added, as required by RFC 2026.
