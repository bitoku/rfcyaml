This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB) for use with network management protocols in TCP/IP based internets.
In particular, it defines objects for managing devices which implement the FDDI.
The Internet standard Network Management Framework consists of three components.
They are: RFC 1155 which defines the SMI, the mechanisms used for describing and naming objects for the purpose of management.
RFC 1212 defines a more concise description mechanism, which is wholly consistent with the SMI.
RFC 1156 which defines MIB I, the core set of managed objects for the Internet suite of protocols.
RFC 1213, defines MIB II, an evolution of MIB I based on implementation experience and new operational requirements.
RFC 1157 which defines the SNMP, the protocol used for network access to managed objects.
The Framework permits new objects to be defined for the purpose of experimentation and evaluation.
Objects Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed the Management Information Base or MIB.
Objects in the MIB are defined using the subset of Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1)
[5] defined in the SMI.
In particular, each object has a name, a syntax, and an encoding.
The name is an object identifier, an administratively assigned name, which specifies an object type.
The object type together with an object instance serves to uniquely identify a specific instantiation of the object.
For human convenience, we often use a textual string, termed the OBJECT DESCRIPTOR, to also refer to the object type.
The syntax of an object type defines the abstract data structure corresponding to that object type.
The ASN.1 language is used for this purpose.
However, the SMI [1] purposely restricts the ASN.1 constructs which may be used.
These restrictions are explicitly made for simplicity.
The encoding of an object type is simply how that object type is represented using the object type's syntax.
Implicitly tied to the notion of an object type's syntax and encoding
is how the object type is represented when being transmitted on the network.
The SMI specifies the use of the basic encoding rules of ASN.1 [6], subject to the additional requirements imposed by the SNMP.
Format of Definitions Section 5 contains contains the specification of all object types contained in this MIB module.
The object types are defined using the conventions defined in the SMI, as amended by the extensions specified in [7].
This document defines the managed objects for FDDI devices which are to be accessible via the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
At present, this applies to these values of the ifType variable in the Internet standard MIB: fddi(15)
For these interfaces, the value of the ifSpecific variable in the MIB II [4] has the OBJECT IDENTIFIER value:
The definitions of the objects presented here draws heavily from related work in the ANSI X3T9.5 committee and the SMT subcommittee of that committee [8].
In fact, the definitions of the managed objects in this document are, to the maximum extent possible, identical to those identified by the ANSI committee.
The semantics of each managed object should be the same with syntactic changes made as necessary to recast the objects in terms of the Internet standard SMI and MIB so as to be compatible with the SNMP.
Examples of these syntactic changes include remapping booleans to enumerated integers, remapping bit strings to octet strings, and the like.
In addition, the naming of the objects was changed to achieve compatibility.
These minimal syntactic changes with no semantic changes should allow implementations of SNMP manageable FDDI systems to share instrumentation with other network management schemes and thereby minimize implementation cost.
In addition, the translation of information conveyed by managed objects from one network management scheme to another is eased by these shared definitions.
Only the essential variables, as indicated by their mandatory status in the ANSI specification were retained in this document.
The importance of variables which have an optional status in the ANSI specification were perceived as being less widely accepted.
Several new datatypes are introduced as a textual convention in this MIB document.
These textual conventions enhance the readability of the document and ease comparisons with its ANSI counterpart.
It should be noted that the introduction of the following textual conventions has no effect on either the syntax nor the semantics of any managed objects.
The use of these is merely an artifact of the explanatory method used.
Objects defined in terms of one of these methods are always encoded by means of the rules that define the primitive type.
Hence, no changes to the SMI or the SNMP are necessary to accommodate these textual conventions which are adopted merely for the convenience of readers and writers in pursuit of the elusive goal of clear, concise, and unambiguous MIB documents.
MIB OBJECT TYPE FROM RFC 1212;
This MIB module uses the extended OBJECT TYPE macro as    defined in [7].
This data type specifies octet units of 80 nanoseconds as   an integer value.
It is used for Path Latency  and   Synchronous Bandwidth values.
The encoding is normal   integer representation (not twos complement).
This data type is used to refer to an instance of a  MAC,   PORT, PATH, or ATTACHMENT Resource ID.
Zero is used to indicate the absence of a resource.
The unique identifier for the FDDI station.
xx xx'   with the low order 6 octet (xx) from a unique IEEE   assigned address.
The high order two bits of the IEEE   address, the group address bit and the administration bit
(Universal/Local) bit should both be zero.
The first two   octets, the yy octets, are implementor defined.
The representation of the address portion of the station id   is in the IEEE (ANSI
canonical notation for   48 bit addresses.
The canonical form is a 6 octet string   where the first octet contains the first 8 bits of the   address, with the I/G(Individual/Group) address bit as the   least significant bit and the  U/L (Universal/Local) bit   as the next more significant bit, and so on.
Note that   addresses in the ANSI FDDI standard SMT frames are   represented in FDDI MAC order.
The representation of long MAC addresses as management   values is in the IEEE (ANSI
canonical   notation for 48 bit addresses.
The canonical form is a   6 octet string where the first octet contains the first 8   bits of the address, with the I/G (Individual/Group)
address bit as the least significant bit
and the  U/L   (Universal/Local) bit as the next more significant bit,
that the addresses in the SMT frames are   represented in FDDI MAC order.
