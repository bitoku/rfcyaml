    \ the documents that describe the current\n   Internet-Standard Management Framework,\
    \ please refer to section 7 of\n   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].\n   Managed objects are\

- title: 3.  Overview
  contents:
  - "3.  Overview\n   This document defines a MIB module for the purpose of remotely\n\
    \   controlling synthetic sources (or 'active' probes) and sinks in order\n  \
    \ to enhance remote performance monitoring capabilities within IP\n   networks\
    \ and services.  Much work within the IETF exists related to\n   performance monitoring.\
    \  One interesting aspect of this body of work\n   is that it does not explicitly\
    \ define an 'active' probe capability.\n   An active probe capability is complimentary\
    \ to existing capabilities,\n   and this MIB module is developed to fill this\
    \ void.\n"
- title: 3.1.  Terms
  contents:
  - "3.1.  Terms\n   The following definitions apply throughout this document:\n \
    \     o 'Performance monitoring' is the act of monitoring traffic for\n      \
    \  the purpose of evaluating a statistic of a metric related to the\n        performance\
    \ of the system.  A performance monitoring system is\n        comprised of a)\
    \ traffic generators, b) measurement, c) data\n        reduction, and d) reporting.\
    \  The traffic generators may be\n        natural sources, synthetic sources,\
    \ or intrusive sources.\n        o A 'synthetic source' is a device or an embedded\
    \ software\n        program that generates a data packet (or packets) and injects\
    \ it\n        (or them) onto the path to a corresponding probe or existing\n \
    \       server solely in support of a performance monitoring function.\n     \
    \   A synthetic source may talk intrusively to existing application\n        servers.\n\
    \   The design goals for this MIB module are:\n      o Complementing the overall\
    \ performance management architecture\n        being defined within the RMONMIB\
    \ WG; refer to the RMONMIB\n        framework document [RFC3577].  This MIB module\
    \ is defined within\n        the context of the APM-MIB [RFC3729].\n      o Extensibility:\
    \ the MIB module should be easily extended to\n        include a greater set of\
    \ protocols and applications for\n        performance monitoring purposes.\n \
    \     o Flexibility: the module should support both round-trip and one-\n    \
    \    way measurements.\n      o Security: the control of the source and sink of\
    \ traffic is\n        handled by a management application, and communication is\n\
    \        recommended via SNMPv3.\n   This document is organized as follows.  The\
    \ next section discusses\n   the relationship of this MIB module to others from\
    \ the RMONMIB and\n   Distributed Management (DISMAN) working groups.  Then the\
    \ structure\n   of the MIB module is discussed.  Finally, the MIB module definitions\n\
    \   are given.\n"
- title: 4.  Relationship to Other MIB modules
  contents:
  - "4.  Relationship to Other MIB modules\n   This MIB module is designed to be used\
    \ in conjunction with the RMON\n   MIB Working Group's two other MIB modules for\
    \ application performance\n   measurement: Application Performance Measurement\
    \ MIB [RFC3729] and\n   Transport Performance Metrics MIB [RFC4150].  These MIB\
    \ modules\n   define reporting capabilities for that framework.  The intent of\
    \ this\n   MIB module is to define a method for injecting packets into the\n \
    \  network utilizing probe capabilities defined in the base MIB modules\n   and\
    \ measured with the reporting MIB modules.  Other reporting MIB\n   modules may\
    \ be used as well.\n   Specifically, this MIB module uses the AppLocalIndex as\
    \ defined in\n   the APM-MIB to map measurement configuration information to\n\
    \   definition and reporting structures defined in the APM-MIB.\n"
- title: 5.  Relationship to Other Work
  contents:
  - "5.  Relationship to Other Work\n   Much work has already been done within the\
    \ IETF that has a direct\n   bearing on the development of active performance\
    \ probe definitions.\n   This body of work has been addressed in various working\
    \ groups over\n   the years.  In this section, we focus on the work of a) the\
    \ IP\n   Performance Metrics (IPPM) working group, b) the DISMAN working\n   group,\
    \ c) the RMON working group, d) the Application MIB (ApplMIB)\n   working group,\
    \ and e) the Realtime Traffic Flow Measurement (RTFM)\n   working group.\n"
- title: 5.1.  IPPM
  contents:
  - "5.1.  IPPM\n   The IPPM working group has defined in detail a set of performance\n\
    \   metrics, sampling techniques, and associated statistics for\n   transport-level\
    \ or connectivity-level measurements.  The IPPM\n   framework document [RFC2330]\
    \ discusses numerous issues concerning\n   sampling techniques, clock accuracy,\
    \ resolution and skew, wire time\n   versus host time, error analysis, etc.  Many\
    \ of these are\n   considerations for configuration and implementation issues\
    \ discussed\n   below.  The IPPM working group has defined several metrics and\
    \ their\n   associated statistics, including\n      + a connectivity metric [RFC2678],\n\
    \      + one-way delay metric [RFC2679],\n      + one-way loss metric [RFC2680],\n\
    \      + round-trip delay and loss metrics [RFC2681],\n      + delay variation\
    \ metric [RFC3393],\n      + a streaming media metric [RFC3432],\n      + a throughput\
    \ metric [EBT] and [TBT], and\n      + others are under development.\n   These\
    \ (or a subset) could form the basis for a set of active,\n   connectivity-level,\
    \ probe types designed for monitoring the quality\n   of transport services. \
    \ A consideration of some of these metrics may\n   form a set of work activities\
    \ and a set of early deliverables for a\n   group developing an active probe capability.\n\
    \   During the early development of the SSPM-MIB, it became apparent that\n  \
    \ a one-way measurement protocol was required in order for the SSPM-MIB\n   to\
    \ control a one-way measurement.  This led to the current work with\n   the IPPM\
    \ WG on the development of the One-Way Measurement Protocol\n   (OWDP) [ODP].\
    \  This work includes both the measurement protocol\n   itself, as well as the\
    \ development of a separate control protocol.\n   This later control protocol\
    \ is redundant with the current work on the\n   SSPM-MIB.  The SSPM-MIB could\
    \ be used as an alternative to the one-\n   way delay control protocol.\n"
- title: 5.2.  DISMAN
  contents:
  - "5.2.  DISMAN\n   The DISMAN working group has defined a set of 'active' tools\
    \ for\n   remote management.  Of relevance to this document are:\n      + the\
    \ pingMIB [RFC2925],\n      + the DNS Lookup MIB [RFC2925],\n      + the tracerouteMIB\
    \ [RFC2925],\n      + the scriptMIB [RFC3165], and\n      + the expressionMIB\
    \ [RFC2982].\n   The pingMIB and tracerouteMIB define an active probe capability,\n\
    \   primarily for the remote determination of path and path connectivity.\n  \
    \ There are some performance-related metrics collected from the\n   pingMIB, and\
    \ one could conceivably use these measurements for the\n   evaluation of a limited\
    \ set of performance statistics.  But there is\n   a fundamental difference between\
    \ determining connectivity and\n   determining the quality of that connectivity.\
    \  However, in the\n   context of performance monitoring, a fault can be viewed\
    \ as not\n   performing at all.  Therefore, both should be monitored with the\
    \ same\n   probes to reduce network traffic.\n   The DNS Lookup MIB also includes\
    \ some probe-like capabilities and\n   performance time measurements for the DNS\
    \ lookup.  This could be used\n   to suggest details of a related session-level,\
    \ active probe.\n   The scriptMIB allows a network management application to distribute\n\
    \   and manage scripts to remote devices.  Conceivably, these scripts\n   could\
    \ be designed to run a set of active probe monitors on remote\n   devices.\n"
- title: 5.3.  RMON
  contents:
  - "5.3.  RMON\n   The RMON working group has developed an extensive, passive monitoring\n\
    \   capability defined in RFC 2819 [RFC2819] and RFC 2021 [RFC2021] as\n   well\
    \ as additional MIB modules.  Initially, the monitors collected\n   statistics\
    \ at the MAC layer, but the capability has now been extended\n   to higher-layer\
    \ statistics.  Higher-layer statistics are identified\n   through the definition\
    \ of a Protocol Directory [RFC2021].  See the\n   RMONMIB framework document [RFC3577]\
    \ for an overview of the RMONMIB\n   capabilities.\n   Within this context, the\
    \ development of an active traffic source for\n   performance monitoring fits\
    \ well within the overall performance\n   monitoring architecture being defined\
    \ within the RMON WG.\n"
- title: 5.4.  ApplMIB
  contents:
  - "5.4.  ApplMIB\n   The ApplMIB working group defined a series of MIB modules that\n\
    \   monitor various aspects of applications, processes, and services.\n   The\
    \ System Application MIB [RFC2287] describes a basic set of managed\n   objects\
    \ for fault, configuration, and performance management of\n   applications from\
    \ a systems perspective.  More specifically, the\n   managed objects it defines\
    \ are restricted to information that can be\n   determined from the system itself\
    \ and that does not require special\n   instrumentation within the applications\
    \ to make the information\n   available.\n   The Application MIB [RFC2564] complements\
    \ the System Application MIB,\n   providing for the management of applications'\
    \ common attributes,\n   which could not typically be observed without the cooperation\
    \ of the\n   software being managed.  There are attributes that provide\n   information\
    \ on application and communication performance.\n   The WWW MIB [RFC2594] describes\
    \ a set of objects for managing\n   networked services in the Internet Community,\
    \ particularly World Wide\n   Web (WWW) services.  Performance attributes are\
    \ available for the\n   information about each WWW service, each type of request,\
    \ each type\n   of response, and top-accessed documents.\n   In the development\
    \ of synthetic application-level probes,\n   consideration should be given to\
    \ the relationship of the application\n   MIB modules to the measurements being\
    \ performed through a synthetic\n   application-level probe.  Similar, cross-indexing\
    \ issues arise within\n   the context of the RMON monitoring and synthetic application-level\n\
    \   active probes.\n"
- title: 5.5.  SNMPCONF
  contents:
  - "5.5.  SNMPCONF\n   The Configuration Management with SNMP (SNMPCONF) working\
    \ group has\n   created the informational RFC 3512 [RFC3512], which outlines the\
    \ most\n   effective methods for using the SNMP Framework to accomplish\n   configuration\
    \ management.  This work includes recommendations for\n   device-specific as well\
    \ as network-wide (Policy) configuration.  The\n   group is also chartered to\
    \ write any MIB modules necessary to\n   facilitate configuration management.\
    \  Specifically, they will write a\n   MIB module that describes a network entity's\
    \ capabilities and\n   capacities, which can be used by management entities making\
    \ policy\n   decisions at a network level or device-specific level.\n   Currently,\
    \ the SNMPCONF working group is focused on the SNMP\n   Configuration MIB for\
    \ policy [RFC4011].  It is conceivable that one\n   would want to monitor the\
    \ performance of newly configured policies as\n   they are implemented within\
    \ networks.  This would require correlation\n   of the implemented policy and\
    \ a related performance monitoring policy\n   that would specify synthetic probe\
    \ definitions.  For synthetic\n   probes, there would be a need for a configuration\
    \ of a) a single\n   probe, b) several probes, c) source and destination probes,\
    \ and d)\n   intermediate probes.  In addition, it may be necessary to configure\n\
    \   any or all of these combinations simultaneously.  It is hoped that\n   the\
    \ work of SNMPCONF will suffice.  The scripting language defined by\n   the SNMP\
    \ Configuration MIB could allow for active monitoring to be\n   activated and\
    \ configured from a policy management script.  Further,\n   the results of active\
    \ monitoring could become arguments in further\n   policy decisions.  This notion\
    \ is reflected in the decision flow\n   outlined in Figure 1 below.\n"

    \ the capabilities of\n   the probe.  Currently, this information is related to\
    \ the resolution\n   of the probe clock and its source.\n"
- title: 6.2.  Source Configuration
  contents:
  - "6.2.  Source Configuration\n   The source is configured with a pair of tables.\
    \  The first,\n   sspmSourceProfileTable, defines a set of profiles for monitoring.\n\
    \   These profiles are then used by the second table,\n   sspmSourceControlTable,\
    \ to instantiate a specific measurement.  This\n   MIB module takes an IP-centric\
    \ view of the configuration of the\n   measurement.\n"
- title: 6.3.  Sink Configuration
  contents:
  - "6.3.  Sink Configuration\n   Configures the sink for measurements.  If the test\
    \ is round-trip,\n   then this table is on the same probe as the source configuration.\
    \  If\n   the test is one-way, then the table is on a different probe.  The\n\
    \   sspmSinkInstance is a unique identifier for the entry per probe.\n   Additional\
    \ attributes are provided for test type and test source to\n   identify entries\
    \ in the table uniquely.\n"

  contents:
  - "8.  Security Considerations\n   This MIB module defines objects that allow packets\
    \ to be injected\n   into the network for the purpose of measuring some performance\n\
    \   characteristics.  As such, the MIB module may contain sensitive\n   network\
    \ and application data; e.g., user IDs and passwords.  Further,\n   if security\
    \ is compromised, this MIB module could provide a source\n   for denial-of-service,\
    \ and potential other, attacks.  These issues\n   will be addressed within this\
    \ section.\n   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB module\n\
    \   that have a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such\n  \
    \ objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network\n   environments.\
    \  The support for SET operations in a non-secure\n   environment without proper\
    \ protection can have a negative effect on\n   network operations.  These are\
    \ the tables and objects and their\n   sensitivity/vulnerability:\n      + The\
    \ sspmSourceProfileTable contains objects that configure link-\n        level,\
    \ IP, and application-level data used within test suites.\n        These objects\
    \ with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or\n        read- create are:\n \
    \        o sspmSourcePacketSize - configures the overall size of the\n       \
    \    test packets,\n         o sspmSourceProfileTOS - sets the TOS field in the\
    \ IPv4 and\n           IPv6 headers,\n         o sspmSourceProfileLooseSrcRteFill\
    \ and\n           sspmSourceProfileLooseSrcRteLen - give a list of IPv4 or IPv6\n\
    \           addresses for the loose source route options in the IP\n         \
    \  headers,\n         o sspmSourceProfileFlowLabel - sets the Flow Label in the\
    \ IPv6\n           header,\n         o sspmSourceProfileTTL - sets the TTL field\
    \ in the packet\n           headers,\n         o sspmSourceProfileNoFrag - sets\
    \ the No Fragment bit in the\n           packet headers,\n         o sspmSourceProfile8021Tagging\
    \ - sets the Tag field in the\n           802.1 headers, and\n         o sspmSourceProfileUsername\
    \ and sspmSourceProfilePassword -\n           these hold the ID and passwords\
    \ specific to an application\n           test profile.,\n      + The sspmSourceControlTable\
    \ contains objects that configure IP\n        and application-level data used\
    \ within a given test.  These\n        objects with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write\
    \ and/or read-\n        create are:\n         o sspmSourceControlSrc - controls\
    \ the source IP address used on\n           the test packets,\n         o sspmSourceControlDestAddr\
    \ - holds the destination address for\n           the specific test packet,\n\
    \         o sspmSourceControlTimeout, sspmSourceControlSamplingDist, and\n   \
    \        sspmSourceControlFrequency - control the nature and frequency\n     \
    \      of the test packet injection onto the network, and\n         o sspmSourceControlFirstSeqNum\
    \ and sspmSourceControlLastSeqNum\n           - set the first and last sequence\
    \ numbers for the specific\n           test.\n      + The sspmSinkTable contains\
    \ objects that configure the recipient\n        of the test packets.  As such,\
    \ the objects in this table have no\n        security issues related to them.\n\
    \   Some attributes configure username and password information for some\n   application-level\
    \ protocols as indicated above.  Access to these\n   attributes may provide unauthorized\
    \ use of resources.  These\n   attributes are: sspmSourceProfileUsername and\n\
    \   sspmSourceProfilePassword.\n   Some attributes configure the size and rate\
    \ of traffic flows for the\n   purpose of performance measurements.  Access to\
    \ these attributes may\n   exacerbate the use of this MIB module in denial-of-service\
    \ attacks.\n   It is possible to define a maximum packet rate on the device and\
    \ to\n   indicate this rate through the sspmSourceFrequency object.  This\n  \
    \ object reflects the maximum acceptable packet rate that a device\n   supporting\
    \ this MIB module is willing to generate.  This places a\n   bound on setting\
    \ the test packet rate through the\n   sspmSourceControlFrequency object.  Other\
    \ objects that control\n   aspects of the test packets related to packet size\
    \ and rate are\n   sspmSourceControlTimeOut, sspmSourceControlSamplingDist and\n\
    \   sspmSourceControlFrequency.\n   The objects sspmSourceControlSrc, sspmSourceControlDestAddr,\n\
    \   sspmSourceControlLooseSrcRteFill, and sspmSourceControlLooseSrcRteLen\n  \
    \ control the setting of the source and destination addresses on the\n   packet\
    \ headers and the routing of the packets.  The device should not\n   allow the\
    \ setting of source addresses on the test packets other than\n   those that are\
    \ administratively configured onto the device.  This is\n   controlled by using\
    \ the syntax InterfaceIndexOrZero for the control\n   of the source address through\
    \ the sspmSourceControlSrc object.\n   It is thus important to control even GET\
    \ access to these objects and\n   possibly to even encrypt the values of these\
    \ object when sending them\n   over the network via SNMP.  Not all versions of\
    \ SNMP provide features\n   for such a secure environment.\n   SNMP versions prior\
    \ to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.\n   Even if the network itself\
    \ is secure (for example by using IPSec),\n   even then, there is no control as\
    \ to who on the secure network is\n   allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete)\
    \ the objects\n   in this MIB module.\n   It is RECOMMENDED that implementers\
    \ consider the security features as\n   provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see\
    \ [RFC3410], section 8),\n   including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic\
    \ mechanisms (for\n   authentication and privacy).\n   Further, deployment of\
    \ SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT\n   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED\
    \ to deploy SNMPv3 and to\n   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator\n\
    \   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an\n   instance\
    \ of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to\n   the objects\
    \ only to those principals (users) that have legitimate\n   rights to indeed GET\
    \ or SET (change/create/delete) them.\n"
