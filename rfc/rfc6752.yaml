- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   In the mid to late 1990s, some Internet Service Providers\
    \ (ISPs)\n   adopted the practice of utilising private (or non-globally unique)\n\
    \   [RFC1918] IP addresses for the infrastructure links and in some cases\n  \
    \ the loopback interfaces within their networks.  The reasons for this\n   approach\
    \ centered on conservation of address space (i.e., scarcity of\n   public IPv4\
    \ address space) and security of the core network (also\n   known as core hiding).\n\
    \   However, a number of technical and operational issues occurred as a\n   result\
    \ of using private (or non-globally unique) IP addresses, and\n   virtually all\
    \ these ISPs moved away from the practice.  Tier 1 ISPs\n   are considered the\
    \ benchmark of the industry and as of the time of\n   writing, there is no known\
    \ tier 1 ISP that utilises the practice of\n   private addressing within their\
    \ core network.\n   The following sections will discuss the various issues associated\n\
    \   with deploying private [RFC1918] IP addresses within ISP core\n   networks.\n\
    \   The intent of this document is not to suggest that private IP\n   addresses\
    \ can not be used with the core of an SP network, as some\n   providers use this\
    \ practice and operate successfully.  The intent is\n   to outline the potential\
    \ issues or effects of such a practice.\n   Note:  The practice of ISPs using\
    \ \"squat\" address space (also known\n   as \"stolen\" space) has many of the\
    \ same, plus some additional, issues\n   (or effects) as that of using private\
    \ IP address space within core\n   networks.  The term \"squat IP address space\"\
    \ refers to the practice\n   of an ISP using address space for its own infrastructure/core\
    \ network\n   addressing that has been officially allocated by an RIR (Regional\n\
    \   Internet Registry) to another provider, but that provider is not\n   currently\
    \ using or advertising within the Internet.  Squat addressing\n   is not discussed\
    \ further in this document.  It is simply noted as an\n   associated issue.\n"
- title: 2.  Conservation of Address Space
  contents:
  - "2.  Conservation of Address Space\n   One of the original intents for the use\
    \ of private IP addressing\n   within an ISP core was the conservation of IP address\
    \ space.  When an\n   ISP is allocated a block of public IP addresses (from an\
    \ RIR), this\n   address block was traditionally split in order to dedicate some\n\
    \   portion for infrastructure use (i.e., for the core network) and the\n   other\
    \ portion for customer (subscriber) or other address pool use.\n   Typically,\
    \ the number of infrastructure addresses needed is\n   relatively small in comparison\
    \ to the total address count.  So unless\n   the ISP was only granted a small\
    \ public block, dedicating some\n   portion to infrastructure links and loopback\
    \ addresses (/32) is\n   rarely a large enough issue to outweigh the problems\
    \ that are\n   potentially caused when private address space is used.\n   Additionally,\
    \ specifications and equipment capability improvements\n   now allow for the use\
    \ of /31 subnets [RFC3021] for link addresses in\n   place of the original /30\
    \ subnets -- further minimising the impact of\n   dedicating public addresses\
    \ to infrastructure links by only using two\n   (2) IP addresses per point-to-point\
    \ link versus four (4),\n   respectively.\n   The use of private addressing as\
    \ a conservation technique within an\n   Internet Service Provider (ISP) core\
    \ can cause a number of technical\n   and operational issues or effects.  The\
    \ main effects are described\n   below.\n"
- title: 3.  Effects on Traceroute
  contents:
  - "3.  Effects on Traceroute\n   The single biggest effect caused by the use of\
    \ private addressing\n   [RFC1918] within an Internet core is the fact that it\
    \ can disrupt the\n   operation of traceroute in some situations.  This section\
    \ provides\n   some examples of the issues that can occur.\n   A first example\
    \ illustrates the situation where the traceroute\n   crosses an Autonomous System\
    \ (AS) boundary, and one of the networks\n   has utilised private addressing.\
    \  The following simple network is\n   used to show the effects.\n           \
    \   AS64496                 EBGP                AS64497\n                    IBGP\

    \ such as those employed in most firewalls and many other\n   network devices\
    \ can cause the same effect.\n   The effects are illustrated in a second example\

    \ the traceroute.  Such an approach\n   can be used in many operational situations\

  - "4.  Effects on Path MTU Discovery\n   The Path MTU Discovery (PMTUD) process\
    \ was designed to allow hosts to\n   make an accurate assessment of the maximum\
    \ packet size that can be\n   sent across a path without fragmentation.  Path\

    \  If the router's interface address is a\n   private IP address, then this ICMP\

    \ PMTUD mechanism\n   fails, this will cause transmission of data between the\

- title: 5.  Unexpected Interactions with Some NAT Implementations
  contents:
  - "5.  Unexpected Interactions with Some NAT Implementations\n   Private addressing\
    \ is legitimately used within many enterprise,\n   corporate, or government networks\
    \ for internal network addressing.\n   When users on the inside of the network\
    \ require Internet access, they\n   will typically connect through a perimeter\
    \ router, firewall, or\n   network proxy that provides Network Address Translation\
    \ (NAT) or\n   Network Address Port Translation (NAPT) services to a public\n\
    \   interface.\n   Scarcity of public IPv4 addresses is forcing many service providers\n\
    \   to make use of NAT.  CGN (Carrier-Grade NAT) will enable service\n   providers\
    \ to assign private [RFC1918] IPv4 addresses to their\n   customers rather than\
    \ public, globally unique IPv4 addresses.  NAT444\n   will make use of a double\
    \ NAT process.\n   Unpredictable or confusing interactions could occur if traffic\
    \ such\n   as traceroute, PMTUD, and possibly other applications were launched\n\
    \   from the NAT IPv4 'inside address', and it passed over the same\n   address\
    \ range in the public IP core.  While such a situation would be\n   unlikely to\
    \ occur if the NAT pools and the private infrastructure\n   addressing were under\
    \ the same administration, such a situation could\n   occur in the more typical\
    \ situation of a NATed corporate network\n   connecting to an ISP.  For example,\
    \ say 10.1.1.0/24 is used to\n   internally number the corporate network.  A traceroute\
    \ or PMTUD\n   request is initiated inside the corporate network from say 10.1.1.1.\n\
    \   The packet passes through a NAT (or NAPT) gateway, then over an ISP\n   core\
    \ numbered from the same range.  When the responses are delivered\n   back to\
    \ the originator, the returned packets from the privately\n   addressed part of\
    \ the ISP core could have an identical source and\n   destination address of 10.1.1.1.\n\

    \ [RFC1918] address space becomes\n   utilised on both the inside and outside\

  - "8.  DNS Interaction\n   Many ISPs utilise their DNS to perform both forward and\
    \ reverse\n   resolution for infrastructure devices and infrastructure addresses.\n\
    \   With a privately numbered core, the ISP itself will still have the\n   capability\
    \ to perform name resolution of its own infrastructure.\n   However, others outside\
    \ of the autonomous system will not have this\n   capability.  At best, they will\
    \ get a number of unidentified\n   [RFC1918] IP addresses returned from a traceroute.\n\
    \   It is also worth noting that in some cases, the reverse resolution\n   requests\
    \ may leak outside of the AS.  Such a situation can add load\n   to public DNS\
    \ servers.  Further information on this problem is\n   documented in \"AS112 Nameserver\
    \ Operations\" [RFC6304].\n"
- title: 9.  Operational and Troubleshooting Issues
  contents:
  - "9.  Operational and Troubleshooting Issues\n   Previous sections of this document\
    \ have noted issues relating to\n   network operations and troubleshooting.  In\
    \ particular, when private\n   IP addressing within an ISP core is used, the ability\
    \ to easily\n   troubleshoot across the AS boundary may be limited.  In some cases,\n\
    \   this may be a serious troubleshooting impediment.  In other cases, it\n  \
    \ may be solved through the use of alternative troubleshooting\n   techniques.\n\
    \   The key point is that the flexibility of initiating an outbound ping\n   or\
    \ traceroute from a privately numbered section of the network is\n   lost.  In\
    \ a complex topology, with multiple paths and exit points\n   from the AS, the\
    \ provider may be restricted in its ability to trace\n   paths through the network\
    \ to other ASes.  Such a situation could be a\n   severe troubleshooting impediment.\n\
    \   For users outside of the AS, the loss of the ability to use a\n   traceroute\
    \ for troubleshooting is very often a serious issue.  As\n   soon as many of these\
    \ people see a row of \"* * *\" in a traceroute\n   they often incorrectly assume\
    \ that a large part of the network is\n   down or inaccessible (e.g., behind a\
    \ firewall).  Operational\n   experience in many large providers has shown that\
    \ significant\n   confusion can result.\n   With respect to [RFC1918] IP addresses\
    \ applied as loopbacks, in this\n   world of acquisitions, if an operator needed\
    \ to merge two networks,\n   each using the same private IP ranges, then the operator\
    \ would likely\n   need to renumber one of the two networks.  In addition, assume\
    \ an\n   operator needed to compare information such as NetFlow / IP Flow\n  \
    \ Information Export (IPFIX) or syslog, between two networks using the\n   same\
    \ private IP ranges.  There would likely be an issue as the unique\n   ID in the\
    \ collector is, in most cases, the source IP address of the\n   UDP export, i.e.,\
    \ the loopback address.\n"
- title: 10.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "10.  Security Considerations\n   One of the arguments often put forward for the\
    \ use of private\n   addressing within an ISP is an improvement in the network\
    \ security.\n   It has been argued that if private addressing is used within the\n\
    \   core, the network infrastructure becomes unreachable from outside the\n  \
    \ provider's autonomous system, hence protecting the infrastructure.\n   There\
    \ is legitimacy to this argument.  Certainly, if the core is\n   privately numbered\
    \ and unreachable, it potentially provides a level\n   of isolation in addition\
    \ to what can be achieved with other\n   techniques, such as infrastructure Access\
    \ Control Lists (ACLs), on\n   their own.  This is especially true in the event\
    \ of an ACL\n   misconfiguration, something that does commonly occur as the result\
    \ of\n   human error.\n   There are three key security gaps that exist in a privately\
    \ addressed\n   IP core.\n   1.  The approach does not protect against reflection\
    \ attacks if edge\n       anti-spoofing is not deployed.  For example, if a packet\
    \ with a\n       spoofed source address corresponding to the network's\n     \
    \  infrastructure address range is sent to a host (or other device)\n       attached\
    \ to the network, that host will send its response\n       directly to the infrastructure\
    \ address.  If such an attack was\n       performed across a large number of hosts,\
    \ then a successful\n       large-scale DoS attack on the infrastructure could\
    \ be achieved.\n       This is not to say that a publicly numbered core will protect\n\
    \       from the same attack; it won't.  The key point is that a\n       reflection\
    \ attack does get around the apparent security offered\n       in a privately\
    \ addressed core.\n   2.  Even if anti-spoofing is deployed at the AS boundary,\
    \ the border\n       routers will potentially carry routing information for the\n\
    \       privately addressed network infrastructure.  This can mean that\n    \
    \   packets with spoofed addresses, corresponding to the private\n       infrastructure\
    \ addressing, may be considered legitimate by edge\n       anti-spoofing techniques\
    \ (such as Unicast Reverse Path Forwarding\n       - Loose Mode) and forwarded.\
    \  To avoid this situation, an edge\n       anti-spoofing algorithm (such as Unicast\
    \ Reverse Path Forwarding\n       - Strict Mode) would be required.  Strict approaches\
    \ can be\n       problematic in some environments or where asymmetric traffic\n\
    \       paths exist.\n   3.  The approach on its own does not protect the network\n\
    \       infrastructure from directly connected customers (i.e., within\n     \
    \  the same AS).  Unless other security controls, such as access\n       control\
    \ lists (ACLs), are deployed at the ingress point of the\n       network, customer\
    \ devices will normally be able to reach, and\n       potentially attack, both\
    \ core and edge infrastructure devices.\n"
- title: 11.  Alternate Approaches to Core Network Security
  contents:
  - "11.  Alternate Approaches to Core Network Security\n   Today, hardware-based\
    \ ACLs, which have minimal to no performance\n   impact, are now widespread. \
    \ Applying an ACL at the AS perimeter to\n   prevent access to the network core\
    \ may be a far simpler approach and\n   provide comparable protection to using\
    \ private addressing; such a\n   technique is known as an infrastructure ACL (iACL).\n\
    \   In concept, iACLs provide filtering at the edge network, which allows\n  \
    \ traffic to cross the network core but not to terminate on\n   infrastructure\
    \ addresses within the core.  Proper iACL deployment\n   will normally allow required\
    \ network management traffic to be passed,\n   such that traceroutes and PMTUD\
    \ can still operate successfully.  For\n   an iACL deployment to be practical,\
    \ the core network needs to have\n   been addressed with a relatively small number\
    \ of contiguous address\n   blocks.  For this reason, the technique may or may\
    \ not be practical.\n   A second approach to preventing external access to the\
    \ core is IS-IS\n   core hiding.  This technique makes use of a fundamental property\
    \ of\n   the IS-IS protocol, which allows link addresses to be removed from\n\
    \   the routing table while still allowing loopback addresses to be\n   resolved\
    \ as next hops for BGP.  The technique prevents parties\n   outside the AS from\
    \ being able to route to infrastructure addresses,\n   while still allowing traceroutes\
    \ to operate successfully.  IS-IS core\n   hiding does not have the same practical\
    \ requirement for the core to\n   be addressed from a small number of contiguous\
    \ address blocks as with\n   iACLs.  From an operational and troubleshooting perspective,\
    \ care\n   must be taken to ensure that pings and traceroutes are using source\n\
    \   and destination addresses that exist in the routing tables of all\n   routers\
    \ in the path, i.e., not hidden link addresses.\n   A third approach is the use\
    \ of either an MPLS-based IP VPN or an\n   MPLS-based IP Core where the 'P' routers\
    \ (or Label Switch Routers) do\n   not carry global routing information.  As the\
    \ core 'P' routers (or\n   Label Switch Routers) are only switching labeled traffic,\
    \ they are\n   effectively not reachable from outside of the MPLS domain.  The\
    \ 'P'\n   routers can optionally be hidden so that they do not appear in a\n \
    \  traceroute.  While this approach isolates the 'P' routers from\n   directed\
    \ attacks, it does not protect the edge routers ('PE' routers\n   or Label Edge\
    \ Routers (LERs)).  Obviously, there are numerous other\n   engineering considerations\
    \ in such an approach; we simply note it as\n   an option.\n   These techniques\
    \ may not be suitable for every network.  However,\n   there are many circumstances\
    \ where they can be used successfully\n   without the associated effects of privately\
    \ addressing the core.\n"
