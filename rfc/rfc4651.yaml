  - "1.  Introduction\n   Mobility support for IPv6, or Mobile IPv6, enables mobile\
    \ nodes to\n   migrate active transport connections and application sessions from\n\
    \   one IPv6 address to another.  The Mobile IPv6 specification, RFC 3775\n  \
    \ [1], introduces a \"home agent\", which proxies a mobile node at a\n   permanent\
    \ \"home address\".  A roaming mobile node connects to the home\n   agent through\
    \ a bidirectional tunnel and can so communicate, from its\n   local \"care-of\
    \ address\", as if it was present at the home address.\n   The mobile node keeps\
    \ the home agent updated on its current care-of\n   address via IPsec-protected\
    \ signaling messages [40].\n   In case the correspondent node lacks appropriate\
    \ mobility support, it\n   communicates with the mobile node's home address, and\
    \ thus all data\n   packets are routed via the home agent.  This mode, Bidirectional\n\
    \   Tunneling, increases packet-propagation delays.  RFC 3775 hence\n   defines\
    \ an additional mode for Route Optimization, which allows peers\n   to communicate\
    \ on the direct path.  It requires that the\n   correspondent node can cache a\
    \ binding between the mobile node's home\n   address and current care-of address.\
    \  The challenge with Route\n   Optimization is that an administrative relationship\
    \ between the\n   mobile node and the correspondent node can generally not be\n\
    \   presupposed.  So how can the two authenticate and authorize the\n   signaling\
    \ messages that they exchange?\n   Mobile IPv6 solves this problem by verifying\
    \ a routing property of\n   the mobile node.  Specifically, the mobile node is\
    \ checked to be\n   reachable at its home address and current care-of address\
    \ in that it\n   must prove the reception of a home and care-of keygen token,\n\
    \   respectively.  This is called the \"return-routability procedure\".  It\n\
    \   takes place right before a mobile node registers a new care-of\n   address\
    \ with a correspondent node and is periodically repeated in\n   case the mobile\
    \ node does not move for a while.\n   The advantage of the return-routability\
    \ procedure is that it is\n   lightweight and does not require pre-shared authentication\
    \ material.\n   It also requires no state at the correspondent node.  On the other\n\
    \   hand, the two reachability tests can lead to a handoff delay\n   unacceptable\
    \ for many real-time or interactive applications such as\n   Voice over IP (VoIP)\
    \ and video conferencing.  Also, the security that\n   the return-routability\
    \ procedure guarantees might not be sufficient\n   for security-sensitive applications.\
    \  And finally, periodically\n   refreshing a registration at a correspondent\
    \ node implies a hidden\n   signaling overhead that may prevent mobile nodes from\
    \ hibernation\n   during times of inactivity.\n   Manifold enhancements for Route\
    \ Optimizations have hence been\n   suggested.  This document describes and evaluates\
    \ various strategies\n   on the basis of existing proposals.  It is meant to provide\
    \ a\n   conceptual framework for further work, which was found to be\n   inevitable\
    \ in the context of Route Optimization.  Many scientists\n   volunteered to review\
    \ this document.  Their names are duly recorded\n   in Section 7.  Section 2 analyzes\
    \ the strengths and weaknesses of\n   Route Optimization and identifies potential\
    \ objectives for\n   enhancement.  Different enhancement strategies are discussed,\
    \ based\n   on existing proposals, in Section 3.  Section 4 discusses the\n  \
    \ different approaches and identifies opportunities for further\n   research.\
    \  Section 5 and Section 6 conclude the document.\n   This document represents\
    \ the consensus of the MobOpts Research Group.\n   It has been reviewed by the\
    \ Research Group members active in the\n   specific area of work.  At the request\
    \ of their chairs, this document\n   has been comprehensively reviewed by multiple\
    \ active contributors to\n   the IETF MIP6 Working Group.  At the time of this\
    \ writing, some of\n   the ideas presented in this document have been adopted\
    \ by the\n   Mobility for IP: Performance, Signaling and Handoff Optimization\n\
    \   (mipshop) Working Group in the IETF.\n"
- title: 1.1.  A Note on Public-Key Infrastructures
  contents:
  - "1.1.  A Note on Public-Key Infrastructures\n   Mobile IPv6 Route Optimization\
    \ verifies a mobile node's authenticity\n   through a routing property.  An alternative\
    \ is cryptographic\n   authentication, which requires a binding between a node's\
    \ identity\n   and some sort of secret information.  Although some proposals suggest\n\
    \   installing shared secrets into end nodes when possible (see Section\n   3.10),\
    \ pre-configuration is not an option for general Internet use\n   for scalability\
    \ reasons.  Authentication based on a Public-Key\n   Infrastructure (PKI) does\
    \ not require pair-wise pre-configuration.\n   Here, the secret information is\
    \ the private component of a\n   public/private-key pair, and the binding between\
    \ a node's identity\n   and private key exists indirectly through the cryptographic\n\
    \   properties of public/private-key pairs and a binding between the\n   identity\
    \ and the public key.  An authority trusted by both end nodes\n   issues a certificate\
    \ that effects this latter binding.\n   Large-scale use of a PKI, however, was\
    \ considered unsuitable for\n   mobility management due to the following reasons.\n\
    \   o  There are differing opinions on whether a PKI could scale up to\n     \
    \ hundreds of millions of mobile nodes.  Some people argue they do,\n      as\
    \ there are already examples of certification authorities\n      responsible for\
    \ millions of certificates.  But more important than\n      the expected increase\
    \ in the number of certificates would be a\n      shift in application patterns.\
    \  Nowadays, public-key cryptography\n      is used only for those applications\
    \ that require strong,\n      cryptographic authentication.\n      If it was used\
    \ for mobility management as well, certificate checks\n      would become mandatory\
    \ for any type of application, leading to\n      more checks per user.  Busy servers\
    \ with mobility support might be\n      unwilling to spent the processing resources\
    \ required for this\n      depending on the service they provide.\n   o  Revoked\
    \ certificates are identified on Certificate Revocation\n      Lists (CRLs), which\
    \ correspondent nodes with mobility support\n      would have to acquire from\
    \ certification authorities.  CRLs must\n      be kept up to date, requiring periodic\
    \ downloads.  This and the\n      act of checking a certificate against a CRL\
    \ create overhead that\n      some correspondent nodes might be unwilling to spend.\n\
    \   o  Certificate verification may take some time and hence interrupt\n     \
    \ ongoing applications.  This can be disturbing from the user's\n      perspective,\
    \ especially when Route Optimization starts in the\n      middle of a session,\
    \ or the session is very short-term anyway.\n   o  The bigger a PKI grows, the\
    \ more attractive it becomes as an\n      attack target, endangering the Internet\
    \ as a whole.\n   o  There is little experience with using home addresses as\n\
    \      identifiers in certificates.  Although the home address could\n      theoretically\
    \ be placed into a certificate's Subject Alternate\n      Name field, the entities\
    \ responsible for IP-address assignment and\n      certification are usually not\
    \ the same, and it may not be easy to\n      coordinate the two.\n   For these\
    \ reasons, this document does not consider direct\n   authentication of mobile\
    \ nodes based on a PKI.  Nevertheless, it does\n   evaluate certificate-based\
    \ techniques that make the problems\n   identified above more tractable (see Section\
    \ 3.12).\n"
- title: 1.2.  A Note on Source Address Filtering
  contents:
  - "1.2.  A Note on Source Address Filtering\n   RFC 3775 uses care-of-address tests\
    \ to probe a mobile node's presence\n   at its claimed location.  Alternatively,\
    \ verification of care-of\n   addresses may be based on infrastructure in the\
    \ mobile node's local\n   access network.  For instance, the infrastructure can\
    \ verify that the\n   IP source addresses of all packets leaving the network are\
    \ correct.\n   \"Ingress filtering\" [38][43] provides this feature to the extent\
    \ that\n   it inspects the prefix of IP source addresses and ensures topological\n\
    \   correctness.  Network-access providers that use ingress filtering\n   normally\
    \ deploy the technique in their first-hop and site-exit\n   routers.  Similarly,\
    \ ISPs may filter packets originating from a\n   downstream network.\n   Ingress\
    \ filtering may eventually provide a way to replace care-of-\n   address tests.\
    \  But there are still a number of uncertainties today:\n   o  By definition,\
    \ ingress filtering can prevent source-address\n      spoofing only from those\
    \ networks that do deploy the technique.\n      As a consequence, ingress filtering\
    \ needs to be widely, preferably\n      universally, deployed in order to constitute\
    \ Internet-wide\n      protection.  As long as an attacker can get network access\
    \ without\n      filters, all Internet nodes remain vulnerable.\n   o  There is\
    \ little incentive for ISPs to deploy ingress filtering\n      other than conscientiousness.\
    \  Legal or regulatory prescription as\n      well as financial motivation does\
    \ not exist.  A corrupt ISP might\n      even have a financial incentive not to\
    \ deploy the technique, if\n      redirection-based denial-of-service (DoS) attacks\
    \ using Route\n      Optimization ever become possible and are exploited for financial\n\
    \      gain.  A similar issue was observed with, for example, email spam.\n  \
    \ o  Ingress filtering is most effective, and easiest to configure, at\n     \
    \ the first-hop router.  However, since only prefixes are checked,\n      the\
    \ filters inevitably get less precise the further upstream they\n      are enforced.\
    \  This issue is inherent in the technique, so the\n      best solution is checking\
    \ packets as close to the originating\n      nodes as possible, preferably in\
    \ the first-hop routers themselves.\n   o  A popular implementation of ingress\
    \ filtering is \"Reverse Path\n      Forwarding\" (RPF).  This technique relies\
    \ on routes to be\n      symmetric, which is oftentimes the case between edge\
    \ networks and\n      ISPs, but far less often between peering ISPs.  Alternatives\
    \ to\n      RPF are either manually configured access lists or dynamic\n     \
    \ approaches that are more relaxed, and thereby less secure, than\n      RPF [43].\n\
    \   o  Another problem with ingress filtering is multi-homing.  When a\n     \
    \ router attempts to forward to one ISP a packet with a source-\n      address\
    \ prefix from another ISP, filters at the second ISP would\n      block the packet.\
    \  The IETF seeks to find a way around this [39].\n      For instance, one could\
    \ tunnel the packet to the topologically\n      correct ISP, or one could allow\
    \ source-address changes by means of\n      a locator-identifier split [45].\n\
    \   o  Finally, RFC 3775 defines an Alternative Care-of Address option\n     \
    \ that mobile nodes can use to carry a care-of address within a\n      Binding\
    \ Update message outside of the IPv6 header.  Such an\n      address is not subject\
    \ to inspection by ingress filtering and\n      would have to be verified through\
    \ other means [14].\n   Although these problems are expected to get solved eventually,\
    \ there\n   is currently little knowledge on how applicable and deployable, as\
    \ a\n   candidate for care-of-address verification, ingress filtering will\n \
    \  be.  High investments or administrative hurdles could prevent a\n   large,\
    \ preferably universal deployment of ingress filtering, which\n   would hinder\
    \ Internet-wide protection, as mentioned in the first\n   bullet.  For these reasons,\
    \ this document does not consider ingress\n   filtering as a viable alternative\
    \ to care-of-address tests, although\n   things may be different in the future.\n"
- title: 2.  Objectives for Route Optimization Enhancement
  contents:
  - "2.  Objectives for Route Optimization Enhancement\n   Wireless environments with\
    \ frequently moving nodes feature a number\n   of salient properties that distinguish\
    \ them from environments with\n   stationary nodes or nodes that move only occasionally.\
    \  One important\n   aspect is the efficiency of mobility management.  Nodes may\
    \ not\n   bother about a few round-trip times of handoff latency if they do not\n\
    \   change their point of IP attachment often.  But the negative impact\n   that\
    \ a mobility protocol can have on application performance\n   increases with the\
    \ level of mobility.  Therefore, in order to\n   maximize user satisfaction, it\
    \ is important to reduce the handoff\n   latency that the mobility protocol adds\
    \ to existing delays in other\n   places of the network stack.  A related issue\
    \ is the robustness of\n   the mobility protocol, given that temporary outage\
    \ of mobility\n   support can render mobile nodes incapable of continuing to\n\
    \   communicate.\n   Furthermore, the wireless nature of data transmissions makes\
    \ it\n   potentially easier for an attacker to eavesdrop on other nodes' data\n\
    \   or send data on behalf of other nodes.  While applications can\n   usually\
    \ authenticate and encrypt their payload if need be, similar\n   security measures\
    \ may not be feasible for signaling packets of a\n   mobility protocol, in particular\
    \ if communicating end nodes have no\n   pre-existing relationship.\n   Given\
    \ the typically limited bandwidth in a wireless medium, resources\n   ought to\
    \ be spent in an economic matter.  This is especially\n   important for the amount\
    \ of signaling that a mobility protocol\n   requires.\n   Endeavors to enhance\
    \ RFC 3775 Route Optimization generally strive for\n   reduced handoff latency,\
    \ higher security, lower signaling overhead,\n   or increased protocol robustness.\
    \  These objectives are herein\n   discussed from a requirements perspective;\
    \ the technical means to\n   reach the objectives is not considered, nor is the\
    \ feasibility of\n   achieving them.\n"
- title: 2.1.  Latency Optimizations
  contents:
  - "2.1.  Latency Optimizations\n   One important objective for improving Route Optimization\
    \ is to reduce\n   handoff latencies.  Assuming that the home-address test dominates\
    \ the\n   care-of-address test in terms of latency, a Mobile IPv6 handoff takes\n\
    \   one round-trip time between the mobile node and the home agent for\n   the\
    \ home registration, a round-trip time between the mobile node and\n   the home\
    \ agent plus a round-trip time between the home agent and the\n   correspondent\
    \ node for the home-address test, and a one-way time from\n   the mobile node\
    \ to the correspondent node for the propagation of the\n   Binding Update message.\
    \  The first packet sent to the new care-of\n   address requires an additional\
    \ one-way time to propagate from the\n   correspondent node to the mobile node.\
    \  The mobile node can resume\n   communications right after it has dispatched\
    \ the Binding Update\n   message.  But if it requests a Binding Acknowledgment\
    \ message from\n   the correspondent node, communications are usually delayed\
    \ until this\n   is received.\n   These delays are additive and are not subsumed\
    \ by other delays at the\n   IP layer or link layer.  They can cause perceptible\
    \ quality\n   degradations for interactive and real-time applications.  TCP bulk-\n\
    \   data transfers are likewise affected since long handoff latencies may\n  \
    \ lead to successive retransmission timeouts and degraded throughput.\n"
- title: 2.2.  Security Enhancements
  contents:
  - "2.2.  Security Enhancements\n   The return-routability procedure was designed\
    \ with the objective to\n   provide a level of security that compares to that\
    \ of today's non-\n   mobile Internet [46].  As such, it protects against impersonation,\n\
    \   denial of service, and redirection-based flooding attacks that would\n   not\
    \ be possible without Route Optimization.  This approach is based\n   on an assumption\
    \ that a mobile Internet cannot become any safer than\n   the non-mobile Internet.\n\
    \   Applications that require a security level higher than what the\n   return-routability\
    \ procedure can provide are generally advised to use\n   end-to-end protection\
    \ such as IPsec or Transport Layer Security\n   (TLS).  But even then they are\
    \ vulnerable to denial of service.  This\n   motivates research for stronger Route\
    \ Optimization security.\n   Security enhancements may also become necessary if\
    \ future\n   technological improvements mitigate some of the existing mobility-\n\
    \   unrelated vulnerabilities.\n   One particular issue with Route Optimization\
    \ is location privacy\n   because route-optimized packets carry both home and\
    \ care-of addresses\n   in plaintext.  A standard workaround is to fall back to\
    \ Bidirectional\n   Tunneling when location privacy is needed.  Packets with the\
    \ care-of\n   address are then transferred only between the mobile node and the\n\
    \   home agent, where they can be encrypted through IPsec Encapsulating\n   Security\
    \ Payload (ESP) [42].  But even Bidirectional Tunneling\n   requires the mobile\
    \ node to periodically re-establish IPsec security\n   associations with the home\
    \ agent so as to become untraceable through\n   Security Parameter Indexes (SPIs).\n"
- title: 2.3.  Signaling Optimizations
  contents:
  - "2.3.  Signaling Optimizations\n   Route Optimization requires periodic signaling\
    \ even when the mobile\n   node does not move.  The signaling overhead amounts\
    \ to 7.16 bits per\n   second if the mobile node communicates with a stationary\
    \ node [6].\n   It doubles if both peers are mobile.  This overhead may be negligible\n\
    \   when the nodes communicate, but it can be an issue for mobile nodes\n   that\
    \ are inactive and stay at the same location for a while.  These\n   nodes typically\
    \ prefer to go to standby mode to conserve battery\n   power.  Also, the periodic\
    \ refreshes consume a fraction of the\n   wireless bandwidth that one could use\
    \ more efficiently.\n   Optimizations for reduced signaling overhead could mitigate\
    \ these\n   issues.\n"

    \ as\n   the home agent plays an active role in the return-routability\n   procedure.\

    \ and prevents redirection-based flooding attacks.  Both\n   tests can be performed\
    \ in parallel.\n   A home-address test should be initiated by the mobile node\

  - "3.3.  Optimistic Behavior\n   Many Mobile IPv6 implementations [29][31] defer\
    \ a correspondent\n   registration until the associated home registration has\
    \ been\n   completed successfully.  In contrast to such \"conservative\" behavior,\n\
    \   a more \"optimistic\" approach is to begin the return-routability\n   procedure\
    \ in parallel with the home registration [52].  Conservative\n   behavior avoids\
    \ a useless return-routability procedure in case the\n   home registration fails.\
    \  This comes at the cost of additional\n   handoff delay when the home registration\
    \ is successful.  Optimistic\n   behavior saves this delay, but the return-routability\
    \ procedure will\n   be in vain should the corresponding home registration be\n\
    \   unsuccessful.\n   While a parallelization of the home registration and the\
    \ return-\n   routability procedure is feasible within the bounds of RFC 3775,\
    \ the\n   specification does not permit mobile nodes to continue with the\n  \
    \ correspondent registration, by sending a Binding Update message to\n   the correspondent\
    \ node, until a Binding Acknowledgment message\n   indicating successful home\
    \ registration has been received.  This is\n   usually not a problem because the\
    \ return-routability procedure is\n   likely to take longer than the home registration\
    \ anyway.  However,\n   some optimizations (see Section 3.4) reduce the delay\
    \ caused by the\n   return-routability procedure.  A useful improvement is then\
    \ to allow\n   Binding Update messages to be sent to correspondent nodes even\
    \ before\n   the home registration has been acknowledged.\n   The drawback of\
    \ optimistic behavior is that a lost, reordered, or\n   rejected Binding Update\
    \ message can cause data packets to be\n   discarded.  Nevertheless, packet loss\
    \ would have similar negative\n   impacts on conservative approaches, so the mobile\

  - "3.6.  Diverted Routing\n   Given that a home registration is faster than a correspondent\n\
    \   registration in the absence of additional optimizations, the mobile\n   node\
    \ may request its traffic to be routed through the home address\n   until a new\
    \ binding has been set up at the correspondent node\n   [52][51].  The performance\
    \ of such diverted routing depends on the\n   propagation properties of the involved\
    \ routes, however.\n   For packets to be diverted via the home address, signaling\
    \ is\n   necessary with both the home agent and the correspondent node.  The\n\
    \   home agent must be informed about the new care-of address so that it\n   can\
    \ correctly forward packets intercepted at the home address.  The\n   correspondent\
    \ node continues to send packets to the old care-of\n   address until it receives\

    \ on the propagation latency on the end-to-end path via the\n   home agent relative\
    \ to the latency on the direct path for how long\n   the correspondent node should\
    \ continue to send packets to the home\n   address.  If the former path is slow,\

- title: 3.7.  Credit-Based Authorization
  contents:
  - "3.7.  Credit-Based Authorization\n   Concurrent care-of-address tests (see Section\
    \ 3.5) require protection\n   against spoofed unverified care-of addresses and\
    \ redirection-based\n   flooding attacks.  Credit-Based Authorization [50] is\
    \ a technique\n   that provides such protection based on the following three\n\
    \   hypotheses:\n   1.  A flooding attacker typically seeks to somehow multiply\
    \ the\n       packets it assembles for the purpose of the attack because\n   \
    \    bandwidth is an ample resource for many attractive victims.\n   2.  An attacker\
    \ can always cause unamplified flooding by generating\n       bogus packets itself\
    \ and sending them to its victim directly.\n   3.  Consequently, the additional\
    \ effort required to set up a\n       redirection-based flooding attack pays off\
    \ for the attacker only\n       if amplification can be obtained this way.\n \
    \  On this basis, rather than eliminating malicious packet redirection\n   in\
    \ the first place, Credit-Based Authorization prevents any\n   amplification that\
    \ can be reached through it.  This is accomplished\n   by limiting the data a\
    \ correspondent node can send to an unverified\n   care-of address of a mobile\
    \ node by the data that the correspondent\n   node has recently received from\
    \ that mobile node.  (See Section 3.5\n   for a definition on when a care-of address\
    \ is verified and when it is\n   unverified.)  A redirection-based flooding attack\
    \ is thus no more\n   attractive than pure direct flooding, where the attacker\
    \ itself sends\n   bogus packets to the victim.  It is actually less attractive\

    \ Credit-Based Authorization for an exemplifying\n   exchange of data packets:\
    \  The correspondent node measures the bytes\n   received from the mobile node.\
    \  When the mobile node registers a new\n   care-of address, the correspondent\
    \ node labels this address\n   \"unverified\" and sends packets there as long\
    \ as the sum of the packet\n   sizes does not exceed the measured, received data\
    \ volume.  A\n   concurrent care-of-address test is meanwhile performed.  Once\
    \ the\n   care-of address has been verified, the correspondent node relabels\n\
    \   the address from \"unverified\" to \"verified\".  Packets can then be\n  \
    \ sent to the new care-of address without restrictions.  When\n   insufficient\
    \ credit is left while the care-of address is still\n   \"unverified\", the correspondent\
    \ node stops sending further packets to\n   the address until the verification\
    \ completes.  The correspondent node\n   may drop these packets, direct them to\
    \ the mobile node's home\n   address, or buffer them for later transmission when\
    \ the care-of\n   address is verified.  Figure 2 does not show Mobile IPv6 signaling\n\
    \   packets.\n   The correspondent node ensures that the mobile node's acquired\
    \ credit\n   gradually decreases over time.  This \"aging\" prevents the mobile\
    \ node\n   from building up credit over a long time.  A malicious node with a\n\
    \   slow Internet connection could otherwise provision for a burst of\n   redirected\
    \ packets that does not relate to its own upstream capacity.\n   Allocating the\
    \ mobile node's credit based on the packets that the\n   mobile node sends and\
    \ reducing the credit based on packets that the\n   mobile node receives is defined\
    \ as \"Inbound Mode\".  (The\n   correspondent node is in control of credit allocation,\
    \ and it\n   computes the credit based on inbound packets received from the mobile\n\
    \   node.)  A nice property of Inbound Mode is that it does not require\n   support\
    \ from the mobile node.  The mobile node neither needs to\n   understand that\
    \ Credit-Based Authorization is effective at the\n   correspondent node, nor does\
    \ it have to have an idea of how much\n   credit it has at a particular point\
    \ in time.\n   Inbound Mode works fine with applications that send comparable\
    \ data\n   volumes into both directions.  On the other hand, the mode may\n  \
    \ prevent the mobile node from collecting the amount of credit it needs\n   for\
    \ a handoff when applications with asymmetric traffic patterns are\n   in use.\
    \  For instance, file transfers and media streaming are\n   characterized by high\
    \ throughput towards the client, typically the\n   mobile node, and comparably\
    \ little throughput towards the serving\n   correspondent node.\n   An additional\
    \ \"Outbound Mode\" was designed to better accommodate\n   applications with asymmetric\
    \ traffic patterns.  In Outbound Mode,\n   packets that the correspondent node\
    \ sends to the mobile node\n   determine both, how much the credit increases while\
    \ the current\n   care-of address is verified, and how much the credit shrinks\
    \ while\n   the care-of address is unverified.  This resolves the issue with\n\
    \   asymmetric traffic patterns.\n   The security of Outbound Mode is based on\
    \ the further hypothesis that\n   the mobile node invests comparable effort for\
    \ packet reception and\n   transmission in terms of bandwidth, memory, and processing\
    \ capacity.\n   This justifies why credit, allocated for packets received by the\n\
    \   mobile node, can be turned into packets that the correspondent node\n   sends.\
    \  The question is, though, how the correspondent node can\n   determine how many\
    \ of the packets sent to a mobile node are actually\n   received and processed\
    \ by that mobile node.  Relying on transport-\n   layer acknowledgments is not\
    \ an option as such messages can easily be\n   faked.  Outbound Mode hence defines\
    \ its own feedback mechanism,\n   Care-of Address Spot Checks, which is robust\
    \ to spoofing.  The\n   correspondent node periodically tags packets that it sends\
    \ to the\n   mobile node with a random, unguessable number, a so-called Spot Check\n\
    \   Token.  When the mobile node receives a packet with an attached Spot\n   Check\
    \ Token, it buffers the token until it sends the next packet to\n   the correspondent\
    \ node.  The Spot Check Token is then included in\n   this packet.  Upon reception,\
    \ the correspondent node verifies whether\n   the returned Spot Check Token matches\
    \ a token recently sent to the\n   mobile node.  New credit is allocated in proportion\
    \ to the ratio\n   between the number of successfully returned Spot Check Tokens\
    \ and the\n   total number of tokens sent.  This implies that new credit is\n\
    \   approximately proportional to the fraction of packets that have made\n   their\
    \ way at least up to the mobile node's IP stack.  The preciseness\n   of Care-of\
    \ Address Spot Checks can be traded with overhead through\n   the frequency with\
    \ which packets are tagged with Spot Check Tokens.\n   An interesting question\
    \ is whether Outbound Mode could be misused by\n   an attacker with asymmetric\
    \ Internet connection.  Widespread digital\n   subscriber lines (DSL), for example,\
    \ typically have a much higher\n   download rate than upload rate.  The limited\
    \ upload rate would render\n   most denial-of-service attempts through direct\
    \ flooding meaningless.\n   But the attacker could leverage the strong download\
    \ rate to build up\n   credit at one or multiple correspondent nodes.  It could\
    \ then\n   illegitimately spend the credit on a stronger, redirection-based\n\
    \   flooding attack.  The reason why this has so far not been considered\n   an\
    \ issue is that, in order to accumulate enough credit at the remote\n   end, the\
    \ attacker would first have to expose itself to the same\n   packet flood that\
    \ it could then redirect towards the victim.\n"

  - "3.8.  Heuristic Monitoring\n   Heuristic approaches to prevent misuse of unverified\
    \ care-of\n   addresses (see Section 3.5) are conceivable as well.  A heuristic,\n\

- title: 3.9.  Crypto-Based Identifiers
  contents:
  - "3.9.  Crypto-Based Identifiers\n   A Crypto-Based Identifier (CBID) is an identifier\
    \ with a strong\n   cryptographic binding to the public component of its owner's\n\
    \   public/private-key pair [33].  This allows the owner to prove its\n   claim\
    \ on the CBID:  It signs a piece of data with its private key and\n   sends this\
    \ to the verifier along with its public key and the\n   parameters necessary to\
    \ recompute the CBID.  The verifier recomputes\n   the CBID and checks the owner's\
    \ knowledge of the corresponding\n   private key.\n   CBIDs offer three main advantages:\
    \  First, spoofing attacks against a\n   CBID are much harder than attacks against\
    \ a non-cryptographic\n   identifier like a domain name or a Mobile IPv6 home\
    \ address.  Though\n   an attacker can always create its own CBID, it is unlikely\
    \ to find a\n   public/private-key pair that produces someone else's.  Second,\
    \ a CBID\n   does not depend on a PKI given its inherent binding to the owner's\n\
    \   public key.  Third, a CBID can be used to bind a public key to an IP\n   address,\
    \ in which case it is called a Cryptographically Generated\n   Address (CGA) [44][34][47].\
    \  A CGA is syntactically just an ordinary\n   IPv6 address.  It has a standard\
    \ routing prefix and an interface\n   identifier generated from a hash on the\
    \ CGA owner's public key and\n   additional parameters.\n   Many applications\
    \ are conceivable where CGAs are advantageous.  In\n   Mobile IPv6, CGAs can bind\
    \ a mobile node's home address to its public\n   key [35][5] and so avoid the\
    \ home-address test in most correspondent\n   registrations.  This accelerates\
    \ the registration process and allows\n   the peers to communicate independently\
    \ of home-agent availability.\n   Since only the interface identifier of a CGA\
    \ is cryptographically\n   protected, its network prefix can be spoofed, and flooding\
    \ attacks\n   against networks are still an issue.  An initial home-address test\
    \ is\n   hence required to validate the network prefix even when the home\n  \
    \ address is a CGA.  For the same reason, CGAs are rarely used as\n   care-of\
    \ addresses.\n   One limitation of CGAs compared to other types of CBIDs is that\
    \ the\n   cryptographically protected portion is only at most 62 bits long.\n\
    \   The rest of the address is occupied by a 64-bit network prefix as\n   well\
    \ as the universal/local and individual/group bits.  (The\n   specification in\
    \ [44] further hard-codes a 3-bit security parameter\n   into the address, reducing\
    \ the cryptographically protected portion to\n   59 bits.)  A brute-force attack\
    \ might thus reveal a public/private\n   key public/private-key pair that produces\
    \ a certain CGA.  This\n   vulnerability can be contained by including the network\
    \ prefix in the\n   hash computation for the interface identifier so that an attacker,\
    \ in\n   case it did find the right public/private key public/private-key\n  \
    \ pair, could not form CGAs for multiple networks from it.\n   To resolve collisions\
    \ in generating CGAs, a collision count is part\n   of the input to the hash function.\
    \  Changing this produces a\n   different CGA.  Unfortunately, the collision count\
    \ also reduces the\n   complexity of a brute-force attack against a CGA because\
    \ it allows\n   the same private/public-key pair to be used to generate multiple\n\
    \   CGAs.  The collision count is therefore limited to a few values only.\n  \
    \ Higher security can be achieved through longer CBIDs.  For example, a\n   node's\
    \ primary identifier in the Host Identity Protocol [21] is a\n   128-bit hash\
    \ on the node's public key.  It is used as an IP-address\n   replacement at stack\
    \ layers above IP.  This CBID is not routable, so\n   there needs to be some external\
    \ localization mechanism if a node\n   wants to contact a peer of which it only\
    \ knows the identifier.\n"
- title: 3.10.  Pre-Configuration
  contents:
  - "3.10.  Pre-Configuration\n   Where mobile and correspondent nodes can be pre-configured\
    \ with a\n   shared key, bound to the mobile node's home address, authentication\n\
    \   through a home-address test can be replaced by a cryptographic\n   mechanism.\
    \  This has three advantages.  First, cryptography allows\n   for stronger authentication\
    \ than address tests.  Second, strong\n   authentication facilitates binding lifetimes\
    \ longer than the 7-\n   minute limit that RFC 3775 defines for correspondent\
    \ registrations.\n   Third, handoff delays are usually shorter with cryptographic\n\
    \   approaches because the round-trips of the home-address test can be\n   spared.\
    \  The disadvantage of pre-configuration is its limited\n   applicability.\n \
    \  Two proposals for pre-configuration are currently under discussion\n   within\
    \ the IETF.  [25] endows mobile nodes with the information they\n   need to compute\
    \ home and care-of keygen tokens themselves rather than\n   having to obtain them\
    \ through the return-routability procedure. [15]\n   uses the Internet Key Exchange\
    \ protocol to establish an IPsec\n   security association between the peers.\n\
    \   From a technical standpoint, pre-configuration can only replace a\n   home-address\
    \ test.  A test of the care-of address is still necessary\n   to verify the mobile\
    \ node's presence at that address.  The problem is\n   circumvented in [25] by\
    \ postulating that the correspondent node has\n   sufficient trust in the mobile\
    \ node to believe that the care-of\n   address is correct.  This assumption discourages\
    \ the use of pre-\n   configuration in scenarios where such trust is unavailable,\
    \ however.\n   For example, a mobile-phone operator may be able to configure\n\
    \   subscribers with secret keys for authorization to a particular\n   service,\
    \ but it may not be able to vouch that all subscribers use\n   this service in\
    \ a responsible manner.  And even if users are\n   trustworthy, their mobile nodes\
    \ may become infected with malware and\n   start behaving unreliably.\n   Another\
    \ way to avoid care-of-address verification is to rely on\n   access networks\
    \ to filter out packets with incorrect IP source\n   addresses [38][43].  This\
    \ approach is taken in [15].  The problem\n   with local filtering is that it\
    \ can only protect a network from\n   becoming the source of an attack, not from\
    \ falling victim to an\n   attack.  The technique is hence potentially unreliable\
    \ unless\n   deployed in access networks worldwide (see Section 1.2).\n   Care-of-address\
    \ tests facilitate the use of pre-configuration in\n   spite of lacking trust\
    \ relationships or the existence of access\n   networks without local filtering\
    \ techniques.  For increased\n   performance, concurrent care-of-address tests\
    \ can be used in\n   combination with Credit-Based Authorization or heuristic\
    \ monitoring.\n"
- title: 3.11.  Semi-Permanent Security Associations
  contents:
  - "3.11.  Semi-Permanent Security Associations\n   A compromise between the return-routability\
    \ procedure and pre-\n   configuration are semi-permanent security associations.\
    \  A semi-\n   permanent security association is established between a mobile\
    \ node\n   and a correspondent node upon first contact, and it is used to\n  \
    \ authenticate the mobile node during subsequent correspondent\n   registrations.\
    \  Semi-permanent security associations eliminate the\n   need for periodic home-address\
    \ tests and permit correspondent\n   registrations with lifetimes longer than\
    \ the 7-minute limit specified\n   in RFC 3775.\n   It is important to verify\
    \ a mobile node's home address before a\n   security association is bound to it.\
    \  An impersonator could otherwise\n   create a security association for a victim's\
    \ IP address and then\n   redirect the victim's traffic at will until the security\
    \ association\n   expires.  An initial home-address test mitigates this vulnerability\n\
    \   because it requires the attacker to be on the path between the victim\n  \
    \ and the victim's peer at least while the security association is\n   being established.\
    \  Stronger security can be obtained through\n   cryptographically generated home\
    \ addresses (see Section 3.9).\n   Semi-permanent security associations alone\
    \ provide no verification of\n   care-of addresses and must therefore be supplemented\
    \ by care-of-\n   address tests.  These may be performed concurrently for reduced\n\
    \   handoff delays.  Semi-permanent security associations were first\n   developed\
    \ in [8] where they were called \"purpose-built keys\".\n"
- title: 3.12.  Delegation
  contents:
  - "3.12.  Delegation\n   Section 1.1 lists numerous problems of PKIs with respect\
    \ to\n   authentication of mobile nodes.  These problems become more\n   tractable,\
    \ however, if correspondent nodes authenticate home agents\n   rather than mobile\
    \ nodes, and the home agents vouch for the\n   authenticity and trustworthiness\
    \ of the mobile nodes [37].  Such\n   delegation of responsibilities solves the\
    \ scalability issue with PKIs\n   given that home agents can be expected to be\
    \ much less numerous than\n   mobile nodes.  Certificate revocation becomes less\
    \ delicate as well\n   because home agents are commonly administrated by a mobility\
    \ provider\n   and should as such be more accountable than mobile nodes.\n   Another\
    \ advantage of delegation is that it avoids public-key\n   computations at mobile\
    \ nodes.  On the other hand, the processing\n   overhead at correspondent nodes\
    \ increases.  This may or may not be an\n   issue depending on resources available\
    \ at the correspondent node\n   relative to the services that the correspondent\
    \ node provides.  The\n   correspondent node may also be mobile itself, in which\
    \ case\n   cryptographic operations would be problematic.  Furthermore, the\n\
    \   increased overhead implies a higher risk to resource-exhaustion\n   attacks.\n"
- title: 3.13.  Mobile Networks
  contents:
  - "3.13.  Mobile Networks\n   Mobile nodes may move as a group and attach to the\
    \ Internet via a\n   \"mobile router\" that stays with the group.  This happens,\
    \ for\n   example, in trains or aircraft where passengers communicate via a\n\
    \   local wireless network that is globally interconnected through a\n   satellite\
    \ link.\n   It is straightforward to support such network mobility [41] with a\n\
    \   single home agent and a tunnel between the mobile router and this\n   home\
    \ agent.  The mobile nodes themselves then do not have to be\n   mobility-aware.\
    \  However, Route Optimization for moving networks\n   [36][26][27][55] is more\
    \ complicated.  One possibility is to have the\n   mobile router handle Route\
    \ Optimization on behalf of the mobile\n   nodes.  This requires the mobile router\
    \ to modify incoming and\n   outgoing packets such that they can be routed on\
    \ the direct path\n   between the end nodes.  The mobile router would also have\
    \ to perform\n   Mobile IPv6 signaling on behalf of the mobile nodes.  Similarly,\
    \ a\n   network of correspondent nodes can communicate with mobile nodes,\n  \
    \ through a \"correspondent router\", in a route-optimized way without\n   providing\
    \ mobility support themselves.\n"
- title: 3.14.  Location Privacy
  contents:
  - "3.14.  Location Privacy\n   RFC 3775 fails to conceal a mobile node's current\

    \ track the\n   mobile node's whereabouts.  A workaround is to fall back to\n\
    \   bidirectional tunneling where location privacy is needed.  Packets\n   carrying\
    \ the mobile node's care-of address are thus only transferred\n   between the\
    \ mobile node and the home agent, where they can be\n   encrypted through IPsec\
    \ ESP [42].  But even then should the mobile\n   node periodically re-establish\
    \ its IPsec security associations so as\n   to become untraceable through its\

- title: 4.  Discussion
  contents:
  - "4.  Discussion\n   Common to the proposals discussed in Section 3 is that all\
    \ of them\n   affect a trade-off between effectiveness, on one hand, and economical\n\
    \   deployability, administrative overhead, and wide applicability, on\n   the\
    \ other.  Effectiveness may be equated with low latency, strong\n   security,\
    \ reduced signaling, or increased robustness.  Economy\n   implies no, or only\
    \ moderate requirements in terms of hardware\n   upgrades and software modifications.\
    \  Administrative overhead relates\n   to the amount of manual configuration and\
    \ intervention that a\n   technique needs.\n   The standard return-routability\
    \ procedure avoids costly pre-\n   configuration or new network entities.  This\
    \ minimizes both\n   deployment investments as well as administrative expenses.\
    \  Variants\n   with optimistic behavior and proactive or concurrent IP-address\
    \ tests\n   have these advantages as well.  CBIDs allow for public-key\n   authentication\
    \ without a PKI.  They constitute a more secure\n   alternative to home-address\
    \ tests and are as such most effective when\n   combined with concurrent reachability\
    \ verification.  CBID-based\n   authentication may require nodes to be programmed\
    \ with a mapping\n   between human-readable identifiers and the corresponding\
    \ CBIDs.\n   Pre-configuration is another approach to avoid home-address tests.\n\
    \   It does without computationally expensive public-key algorithms, but\n   requires\
    \ pair-wise credentials and, therefore, administrative\n   maintenance.  Where\
    \ suitable infrastructure is available, end nodes\n   may delegate authentication\
    \ and encryption tasks to trusted network\n   entities which, in turn, vouch for\
    \ the end nodes.  Delegation could\n   resurrect the use of certificates for the\
    \ purpose of mobility\n   support.  But it introduces a dependency on the delegatees,\
    \ adds the\n   provisioning costs for new network entities, and is likely to be\n\
    \   limited to communities of authorized nodes.\n"

  - "6.  Conclusions\n   Mobile IPv6 Route Optimization reduces packet-propagation\
    \ latencies\n   so as to facilitate interactive and real-time applications in\
    \ mobile\n   environments.  Unfortunately, the end-to-end protocol's high handoff\n\
    \   latencies hinder exactly these applications.  A large body of effort\n   has\
    \ therefore recently been dedicated to Route Optimization\n   improvements.  Some\
    \ of the proposed techniques operate on an end-to-\n   end basis, others require\
    \ new or extended infrastructure in the\n   network; some need pre-configuration,\
    \ others are zero-configurable.\n   This document has compared and evaluated the\
    \ different strategies\n   based on a selected set of enhancement proposals. \
    \ It stands out that\n   all proposals make a trade-off between effectiveness,\
    \ on one hand --\n   be it in terms of reduced handoff latency, increased security,\
    \ or\n   lower signaling overhead -- and pre-configuration costs or requisite\n\
    \   network upgrades, on the other.  An optimization's investment\n   requirements,\
    \ in turn, are in relation to its suitability for\n   widespread deployment.\n\
    \   However, the real-life performance of end-to-end mobility does not\n   only\
    \ depend on enhancements of Route Optimization, but ultimately on\n   all parts\
    \ of the protocol stack [2].  Related optimization endeavors\n   are in fact gaining\
    \ momentum, and a comprehensive approach towards\n   Route Optimization must incorporate\
    \ the most suitable solutions\n   amongst them [4].  Whichever proposals will\
    \ eventually reach a\n   maturity level sufficient for standardization, any effort\
    \ should be\n   expended to arrive at that point within the foreseeable future.\n\
    \   Route Optimization requires support from both peers and depends on a\n   solid\
    \ basis of installed implementations in correspondent nodes.\n   This should hence\
    \ be included in emerging IPv6 stacks early on.\n   Although IPv6 deployment is\
    \ yet far away from becoming widespread,\n   the sooner efficient Route Optimization\
    \ will be available, the more\n   likely that it will in the end be ubiquitously\
    \ supported.\n"
