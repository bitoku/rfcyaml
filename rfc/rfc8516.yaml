  - "1.  Introduction\n   The Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) [RFC7252] response\
    \ codes\n   are used by a CoAP server to indicate the result of an attempt to\n\
    \   understand and satisfy a request sent by a client.\n   CoAP response codes\
    \ are similar to the HTTP [RFC7230] status codes,\n   and many codes are shared\
    \ with similar semantics by both CoAP and\n   HTTP.  HTTP has the code \"429\"\
    \ registered for \"Too Many Requests\"\n   [RFC6585].  This document registers\
    \ a CoAP response code \"4.29\" for\n   similar purposes and uses the Max-Age\
    \ option (see Section 5.10.5 of\n   [RFC7252]) to indicate a back-off period after\
    \ which a client can try\n   the request again.\n   While a server may not be\
    \ able to respond to one kind of request, it\n   may be able to respond to a request\
    \ of a different kind, even from\n   the same client.  Therefore, the back-off\
    \ period applies only to\n   similar requests.  For the purpose of this response\
    \ code, a request\n   is similar if it has the same method and Request-URI.  Also,\
    \ if a\n   client is sending a sequence of requests that are part of the same\n\
    \   series (e.g., a set of measurements to be processed by the server),\n   they\
    \ can be considered similar even if request URIs are different.\n   Because request\
    \ similarity is context-dependent, it is up to the\n   application logic to decide\
    \ how the similarity of the requests should\n   be evaluated.\n   The 4.29 code\
    \ is similar to the 5.03 \"Service Unavailable\" [RFC7252]\n   code in that the\
    \ 5.03 code can also be used by a server to signal an\n   overload situation.\
    \  The 5.03 code also uses the Max-Age option to\n   indicate the time after which\
    \ a client can retry.  However, the 4.29\n   code indicates that the too-frequent\
    \ requests from the requesting\n   client are the reason for the overload.\n"

    , \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"NOT RECOMMENDED\"\
    , \"MAY\", and\n   \"OPTIONAL\" in this document are to be interpreted as described\
    \ in\n   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all\n\
    \   capitals, as shown here.\n   Readers should also be familiar with the terms\
    \ and concepts discussed\n   in [RFC7252].\n"
- title: 3.  CoAP Server Behavior
  contents:
  - "3.  CoAP Server Behavior\n   If a CoAP server is unable to serve a client that\
    \ is sending CoAP\n   request messages more often than the server is capable or\
    \ willing to\n   handle, the server SHOULD respond to the request(s) with the\
    \ response\n   code 4.29, \"Too Many Requests\".  The Max-Age option is used to\n\
    \   indicate the number of seconds after which the server assumes it is\n   OK\
    \ for the client to retry the request.\n   An action result payload (see Section\
    \ 5.5.1 of [RFC7252]) can be sent\n   by the server to give more guidance to the\
    \ client, e.g., details of\n   the overload situation.\n   The 4.29 response code\
    \ is only returned to the client(s) sending\n   requests too frequently; if other\
    \ clients are sending requests that\n   cannot be served due to server overload,\
    \ the 5.03 response code is\n   more appropriate.\n   If a client repeats a request\
    \ that was answered with 4.29 before\n   Max-Age time has passed, it is possible\
    \ that the client sent multiple\n   requests before receiving the first answer\
    \ or that the client did not\n   recognize the response code.  To slow down clients\
    \ that do not\n   recognize the 4.29 code, the server MAY respond with a more\
    \ generic\n   error code (e.g., 5.03).  The server SHOULD rate-limit 4.29 replies\n\
    \   taking into account its usual load-shedding policies.  However, any\n   such\
    \ method that adds per-client state to the server may be\n   counterproductive\
    \ to reducing the load.\n"
- title: 4.  CoAP Client Behavior
  contents:
  - "4.  CoAP Client Behavior\n   If a client receives the 4.29 response code from\
    \ a CoAP server to a\n   request, it SHOULD NOT send a similar request to the\
    \ server before\n   the time indicated in the Max-Age option has passed.  If the\
    \ 4.29\n   response does not contain a Max-Age option, the default value (60\n\
    \   seconds, as defined in Section 5.10.5 of [RFC7252]) is assumed.\n   Note that\
    \ a client may receive a 4.29 response code on a first\n   request to a server.\
    \  This can happen, for example, if there is a\n   proxy on the path and the server\
    \ replies based on the load from\n   multiple clients aggregated by the proxy,\
    \ or if a client has\n   restarted recently and does not remember its recent requests.\n\
    \   A client should not rely on a server being able to send the 4.29\n   response\
    \ code in an overload situation because an overloaded server\n   may not be able\
    \ to reply at all to some requests.\n"
- title: 5.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "5.  Security Considerations\n   Security considerations of [RFC7252] apply to\
    \ this response code\n   also.\n   Replying to CoAP requests with a response code\
    \ consumes resources\n   from a server.  For a server under attack, it may be\
    \ more appropriate\n   to simply drop requests without responding at all.  However,\
    \ dropping\n   requests is also likely to cause well-behaving clients to simply\n\
    \   retry the requests.\n   As with any other CoAP reply, a client should trust\
    \ this response\n   code only to the extent that it trusts the underlying security\n\
    \   mechanisms (e.g., DTLS [RFC6347]) for authentication and freshness.\n   If\
    \ a CoAP reply with the \"Too Many Requests\" response code is not\n   authenticated\
    \ and integrity protected, an attacker can attempt to\n   spoof a reply and make\
    \ the client wait for an extended period of time\n   before trying again.\n  \
    \ If the response code is sent without encryption, it may leak\n   information\
    \ about the server overload situation and client traffic\n   patterns.\n"
