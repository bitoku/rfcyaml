- title: 1.  Introduction

  - "1.  Introduction\n   IS-IS is a link-state routing protocol defined in [ISO10589]\
    \ and\n   [RFC1195].  Extensions in support of advertising new forms of\n   IPv4/IPv6\
    \ prefix reachability are defined in [RFC5305], [RFC5308],\n   and [RFC5120].\n\
    \   There are existing use cases in which knowing additional attributes\n   of\
    \ a prefix is useful.\n   It is useful to know whether or not an advertised prefix\
    \ is directly\n   connected to the advertising router.  In the case of Segment\
    \ Routing\n   as described in [SR], knowing whether or not a prefix is directly\n\
    \   connected determines what action should be taken as regards\n   processing\
    \ of labels associated with an incoming packet.\n   It is useful to know what\
    \ addresses can be used as addresses of the\n   node in support of services (e.g.,\
    \ Remote Loop Free Alternate (RLFA)\n   endpoint).\n   Current formats of the\
    \ Extended Reachability TLVs for both IPv4 and\n   IPv6 are fixed and do not allow\
    \ the introduction of additional flags\n   without backwards compatibility issues.\
    \  Therefore, this document\n   defines a new sub-TLV that supports the advertisement\
    \ of attribute\n   flags associated with prefix advertisements.\n   In cases where\
    \ multiple node addresses are advertised by a given\n   router, it is also useful\
    \ to be able to associate all of these\n   addresses with a single Router ID even\
    \ when prefixes are advertised\n   outside of the area in which they originated.\
    \  Therefore, a new sub-\n   TLV is introduced to advertise the Router ID of the\
    \ originator of a\n   prefix advertisement.\n"

- title: 2.1.  IPv4/IPv6 Extended Reachability Attribute Flags
  contents:
  - "2.1.  IPv4/IPv6 Extended Reachability Attribute Flags\n   This sub-TLV supports\
    \ the advertisement of additional flags\n   associated with a given prefix advertisement.\
    \  The behavior of each\n   flag when a prefix advertisement is leaked from one\
    \ level to another\n   (upwards or downwards) is explicitly defined below.\n \
    \  All flags are applicable to TLVs 135, 235, 236, and 237, unless\n   otherwise\
    \ stated.\n     Prefix Attribute Flags\n     Type:   4\n     Length: Number of\

    \      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+...\n   Bits are defined/sent starting with Bit 0 defined\
    \ below.  Additional\n   bit definitions that may be defined in the future SHOULD\
    \ be assigned\n   in ascending bit order so as to minimize the number of bits\
    \ that will\n   need to be transmitted.\n   Undefined bits MUST be transmitted\
    \ as 0 and MUST be ignored on\n   receipt.\n   Bits that are NOT transmitted MUST\
    \ be treated as if they are set to 0\n   on receipt.\n   X-Flag:  External Prefix\
    \ Flag (Bit 0)\n      Set if the prefix has been redistributed from another protocol.\n\
    \      This includes the case where multiple virtual routers are\n      supported\
    \ and the source of the redistributed prefix is another\n      IS-IS instance.\n\
    \      The flag MUST be preserved when leaked between levels.\n      In TLVs 236\
    \ and 237, this flag SHOULD always be sent as 0 and MUST\n      be ignored on\
    \ receipt.  This is because there is an existing X\n      flag defined in the\
    \ fixed format of these TLVs as specified in\n      [RFC5308] and [RFC5120].\n\
    \   R-Flag:  Re-advertisement Flag (Bit 1)\n      Set when the prefix has been\
    \ leaked from one level to another\n      (upwards or downwards).\n   N-flag:\
    \  Node Flag (Bit 2)\n      Set when the prefix identifies the advertising router,\
    \ i.e., the\n      prefix is a host prefix advertising a globally reachable address\n\
    \      typically associated with a loopback address.\n      The advertising router\
    \ MAY choose to NOT set this flag even when\n      the above conditions are met.\n\
    \      If the flag is set and the prefix length is NOT a host prefix (/32\n  \
    \    for IPV4, /128 for IPv6), then the flag MUST be ignored.  The flag\n    \
    \  MUST be preserved when leaked between levels.\n"
- title: 2.2.  IPv4/IPv6 Source Router ID
  contents:
  - "2.2.  IPv4/IPv6 Source Router ID\n   When a reachability advertisement is leaked\
    \ from one level to\n   another, the source of the original advertisement is unknown.\
    \  In\n   cases where the advertisement is an identifier for the advertising\n\
    \   router (e.g., with the N-flag set in the Prefix Attribute Flags sub-\n   TLV\
    \ as described in Section 2.1), it may be useful for other routers\n   to know\
    \ the source of the advertisement.  The sub-TLVs defined below\n   provide that\
    \ information.\n   Note that the Router ID advertised is always the Router ID\
    \ of the\n   IS-IS instance that originated the advertisement.  This would be\
    \ true\n   even if the prefix had been learned from another protocol (i.e., with\n\
    \   the X-flag set as defined in Section 2.1).\n     IPv4 Source Router ID\n \
    \    Type:   11\n     Length: 4\n     Value:  IPv4 Router ID of the source of\
    \ the advertisement\n   Inclusion of this TLV is optional and MAY occur in TLVs\
    \ 135, 235,\n   236, or 237.  When included, the value MUST be identical to the\
    \ value\n   advertised in the Traffic Engineering router ID (TLV 134) defined\
    \ in\n   [RFC5305].\n   If present the sub-TLV MUST be included when the prefix\
    \ advertisement\n   is leaked to another level.\n     IPv6 Source Router ID\n\
    \     Type:   12\n     Length: 16\n     Value: IPv6 Router ID of the source of\
    \ the advertisement\n   Inclusion of this TLV is optional and MAY occur in TLVs\
    \ 135, 235,\n   236, or 237.  When included, the value MUST be identical to the\
    \ value\n   advertised in the IPv6 TE Router ID (TLV 140) defined in [RFC6119].\n\
    \   If present, the sub-TLV MUST be included when the prefix\n   advertisement\
    \ is leaked to another level.\n"
- title: 2.3.  Advertising Router IDs
  contents:
  - "2.3.  Advertising Router IDs\n   [RFC5305] and [RFC6119] define the advertisement\
    \ of router IDs for\n   IPv4 and IPv6, respectively.  Although both documents\
    \ discuss the use\n   of router ID in the context of Traffic Engineering (TE),\
    \ the\n   advertisement of router IDs is explicitly allowed for purposes other\n\
    \   than TE.  The use of router IDs to identify the source of a prefix\n   advertisement\
    \ as defined in Section 2.2 is one such use case.\n   Therefore, whenever an IPv4\
    \ or IPv6 Source Router ID sub-TLV (as\n   defined in Section 2.2) is used, the\
    \ originating router SHOULD also\n   advertise the corresponding address-family-specific\
    \ router ID TLV.\n"

  contents:
  - "3.  IANA Considerations\n   This document adds the following new sub-TLVs to\

    \ 4\n      Name: Prefix Attribute Flags\n      Value: 11\n      Name: IPv4 Source\

    \ also introduces a new registry for bit values in the\n   Prefix Attribute Flags\
    \ sub-TLV.  The registration policy is Expert\n   Review as defined in [RFC5226].\
    \  This registry is part of the \"IS-IS\n   TLV Codepoints\" registry.  The name\
    \ of the registry is \"Bit Values\n   for Prefix Attribute Flags Sub-TLV\".  The\
