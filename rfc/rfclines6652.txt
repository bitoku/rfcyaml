Abstract This memo presents extensions to the Abuse Reporting Format (ARF) and Sender Policy Framework (SPF) specifications to allow for detailed reporting of message authentication failures in an on demand fashion.
This memo updates RFC 4408 by providing an IANA registry for SPF modifiers.
The Abuse Reporting Format [ARF] defines a message format for sending reports of abuse in the messaging infrastructure, with an eye toward automating both the generation and consumption of those reports.
The Sender Policy Framework [SPF] is one mechanism for message sender authentication; it is "path based", meaning it authenticates the route that a message took from origin to destination.
The output is a verified domain name that can then be subjected to some sort of evaluation process (e.g., comparison to a known good list, submission to a reputation service, etc.).
This document extends [SPF] to add an optional reporting address and other parameters.
Extension of [ARF] to add features required for the reporting of these incidents is covered in [ARF AUTHFAIL] and [ARF AS].
This document additionally creates a an IANA registry of [SPF] record modifiers to avoid modifier namespace collisions.
The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "
SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [KEYWORDS].
The [ABNF] token "qp section" is defined in [MIME].
"local part" is defined in [MAIL].
addr spec" is defined in [MAIL].
3.  Optional Reporting Address for SPF There exist cases in which an ADministrative Management Domain (ADMD) (see [EMAIL ARCH])
employing [SPF] for announcing sending practices may want to know when messages are received via unauthorized routing.
Currently, there is no such method defined in conjunction with standardized approaches such as [ARF].
Similar information can be gathered using a specially crafted [SPF] record and a special DNS server to track [SPF] record lookups.
This document defines the following optional "modifier" (as defined in Section 4.6.1 of [SPF]) to SPF records, using the form defined in that specification: ra   Reporting Address (plain text; OPTIONAL; no default).
MUST be a local part (see Section 3.4.1 of [MAIL]) specifying an e mail address to which a report SHOULD be sent when mail claiming to be from this domain (see Section 2.4 of [SPF] for a description of how domains are identified for SPF checks) has failed the evaluation algorithm described in [SPF], in particular because a message arrived via an unauthorized route.
ra  modifiers in a record that was reached by following an "include" mechanism (defined in Section 5.2 of [SPF]) MUST be ignored.
"ra " qp section rp   Requested Report Percentage (plain text; OPTIONAL;
The value is an integer from 0 to 100 inclusive that indicates what percentage of incidents of SPF failures, selected at random, are to cause reports to be generated.
The report generator SHOULD NOT issue reports for more than the requested percentage of incidents.
An exception to this might be some out of band arrangement between two parties to override it with some mutually agreed value.
Report generators MAY make use of the "Incidents:" field in [ARF] to indicate that there are more reportable incidents than there are reports.
Requested Reports (plain text; OPTIONAL; default is "all").
The value MUST be a colon separated list of tokens representing those conditions under which a report is desired.
See Section 4.1 for a list of valid tags.
In the absence of an "ra " tag in the SPF record, the "rp " and "rr " tags MUST be ignored, and the report generator MUST NOT issue a report.
This memo also includes, as the "rr" tokens defined above, the means by which the sender can request reports for specific circumstances of interest.
Verifiers MUST NOT generate reports for incidents that do not match a requested report and MUST ignore requests for reports not included in this list.
Requested Reports for SPF Failures
The following report requests are defined for SPF results: all  All reports are requested.
e    Reports are requested for messages that produced an SPF result of "TempError" or "PermError".
f    Reports are requested for messages that produced an SPF result of "Fail".
Reports are requested for messages that produced an SPF result of "SoftFail".
Reports are requested for messages that produced an SPF result of "Neutral" or "None".
As required by [IANA CONS], this section contains registry information for the new [SPF] modifiers.
Modifier Registration IANA has created the Modifier Names registry under Sender Policy Framework Parameters, to include a list of all registered SPF modifier names and their defining documents.
New registrations or updates are to be published in accordance with the "Specification Required" guidelines as described in [IANA CONS].
New registrations and updates MUST contain the following information: 1.
Name of the modifier being registered or updated 2.
The document in which the specification of the modifier is published 3.
New or updated status, which MUST be one of the following:
The field is in current use
The field might be in current use but its use is discouraged
The field is no longer in current use
An update may make a notation on an existing registration indicating that a registered field is historic or deprecated if appropriate.
Security Considerations Inherited considerations: implementers are advised to consider the Security Considerations sections of [SPF], [ARF], [ARF AS], and [ARF AUTHFAIL].
In addition to the advice in the Security Considerations section of [ARF AS], these additional considerations apply to the generation of [SPF] authentication failure reports: 6.1.
Identity Selection Preventing an [SPF] failure for SPF authentication failure reports is essential to mitigate the risk of data loops.
If the report is passed to the Message Submission Agent (MSA) (MSA is described in [EMAIL ARCH] using [SMTP]), the HELO/EHLO command parameter SHOULD also be selected so that it will pass [SPF] HELO checks.
It is impossible to predict the volume of reports this facility will generate when enabled by a report receiver.
An implementer ought to anticipate substantial volume, since the amount of abuse occurring at receivers cannot be known ahead of time, and may vary rapidly and unpredictably.
