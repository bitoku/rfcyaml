- title: Description
  contents:
  - "Description\n   The MIME standards (RFC 1521 and 1522) defined methods for\n\
    \   transporting non-ASCII data via a standard RFC822 e-mail system.\n   Specifically,\
    \ the Content-type field allows for the inclusion of any\n   ISO language such\
    \ as Arabic (ISO-8859-6) or Hebrew (ISO-8859-8).  The\n   problem is that the\
    \ these two languages are read from right to left\n   and can have bi-directional\
    \ data such as mixed Hebrew and English on\n   the same line.\n   Fortunately,\
    \ ECMA (European Computer Manufacturers Association) has\n   tackled this problem\
    \ previously and has issued a technical report\n   called \"Handling of Bi-Directional\
    \ Texts\".  ECMA TR/53, as it is\n   called, was used to update the Standard ECMA-48\
    \ which in turn was\n   used as the basis for ISO/IEC 6429 which was adopted under\
    \ a special\n   \"fast track procedure\". It is based on this information that\
    \ a new\n   character set is being defined which will indicate that the bi-\n\
    \   directional message is either encoded in implicit mode or explicit\n   mode.\
    \  The default is visual mode which requires no special character\n   set other\
    \ than the standard ones previously defined by ISO-8859.\n   Examples of new character\
    \ sets for bi-directionality support:\n            Content-type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-6-e\n\
    \            Content-type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-6-i\n            Content-type:\
    \ text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-8-e\n            Content-type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-8-i\n\
    \   The \"i\" suffix refers to implicit mode and the \"e\" suffix refers to\n\
    \   explicit mode.\n"
- title: Implicit
  contents:
  - "Implicit\n   Implicit directionality is a presentation method in which the\n\
    \   direction is determined by an algorithm according to the type of\n   characters\
    \ and their position relative to the adjacent characters and\n   according to\
    \ their primary direction.   The complete algorithm is\n   quite complex and sites\
    \ wishing to implement it should refer to the\n   ECMA Technical Report for further\
    \ details.\n"
- title: Explicit
  contents:
  - "Explicit\n   Explicit directionality is a presentation method in which the\n\
    \   direction is explicitly defined by using control sequences which are\n   interleaved\
    \ within the text and are used for direction determination.\n   This presentation\
    \ method is also defined in ECMA TR/53, which defines\n   three new control functions\
    \ and updates 22 existing control functions\n   in the ECMA-48 standard.\n"
- title: Visual
  contents:
  - "Visual\n   Visual directionality is a presentation method that displays text\n\
    \   according to the primary display direction only, which is left to\n   right.\
    \  All text is viewed in the same direction which is the primary\n   display direction.\
    \  The displaying application is not aware of the\n   contents direction and displays\
    \ the text as if it were a uni-\n   directional text.  The composing application\
    \ needs to prepare the\n   text in such a way that it will be displayed correctly.\
    \  No control\n   characters or algorithms are used to determine how the data\
    \ is to be\n   displayed. This is the simplest of all methods and the default\
    \ method\n   for use with MIME encoded texts.\n"
