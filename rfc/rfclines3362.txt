Abstract This document describes the registration of the MIME sub type image/t38.
The encoding is defined by ITU Recommendation T.38 and is intended for use as an Session Description Protocol (SDP) media descriptor.
Conventions used in this document The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "
SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, RFC 2119 [REQ].
This document describes the registration of the MIME sub type image/t38.
The encoding is defined by [T.38] and is intended for use as an SDP media descriptor.
Definition ITU T Recommendation T.38
[T.38] describes the technical features necessary to transfer facsimile documents in real time between two standard Group 3 facsimile terminals over the Internet or other networks using IP protocols.
The Recommendation allows the use of either TCP or UDP depending on the service environment.
Annex D describes system level requirements and procedures for internet aware facsimile implementations and internet aware facsimile gateways conforming to ITU T T.38 to establish calls with other ITU T T.38 implementations using the procedures defined in IETF RFC 2543
[SIP 99] and IETF RFC 2327 [SDP].
Note that ITU T T.38 Recommendation T.38 (04/02)
[T.38] is an aggregation of the original ITU T Recommendation T.38 (06/98)
[T.38  98] and all of the subsequent Amendments and Corrigendum including [T.38D 00].
While [T.38] and [T.38D 00] describe SIP procedures per [SIP 99], the procedures can also be applied to the revised Session Initiation Protocol specification [SIP].
3.1  image/t38 Usage Annex D of [T.38] describes that the image/t38 media type is intended to indicate a T.38 media stream in SDP.
This media type registration is not intended for email usage.
Registration of Standard MIME media type image/t38 MIME media type name: image MIME subtype name:
t38 Required parameters: none Optional parameters: none Encoding considerations: Binary Security considerations
: This content denotes a facsimile bit stream that may or may not be encrypted.
Interoperability considerations : This MIME media subtype is intended to be used as a parameter by SDP in SIP call setup for T.38 as described in ITU T Rec.
Any use of this media type by email applications is not defined and as a result is not guaranteed to interoperate with a T.38 stream.
