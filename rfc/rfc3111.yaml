  - "1. Introduction\n   The Service Location Protocol (SLP) provides a scalable framework\
    \ for\n   the discovery and selection of network services.  Using this\n   protocol,\
    \ computers using IP based networks no longer need so much\n   static configuration\
    \ of network services for network based\n   applications.  This is especially\
    \ important as computers become more\n   portable, and users less tolerant of\
    \ or less able to fulfill the\n   demands of network administration.\n   The following\
    \ are changes required to have the Service Location\n   Protocol work over IPv6.\
    \  These changes include:\n      -  Eliminating support for broadcast SLP requests\n\
    \      -  Address Specification for IPv6 Addresses in URLs\n      -  Use of IPv6\
    \ multicast addresses and IPv6 address scopes\n      -  Restricted Propagation\
    \ of Service Advertisements\n   The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\"\
    , \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"\
    MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n   document are to be interpreted as described\
    \ in [4].\n"
- title: 2. Eliminating support for broadcast SLP requests
  contents:
  - "2. Eliminating support for broadcast SLP requests\n   Service Location over IPv4\
    \ allows broadcasts to send Service Location\n   request messages.  IPv6 makes\
    \ use of link-local multicast in place of\n   broadcast.  Broadcast-only configuration\
    \ for SLP is not supported\n   under IPv6.  If a User Agent wishes to make a request\
    \ to discover\n   Directory Agents or make a request of multiple Service Agents,\
    \ the\n   User Agent must multicast the request to the appropriate multicast\n\
    \   address.\n   This change modifies the requirements described in Section 6.1\
    \ (Use\n   of Ports, UDP and Multicast) of the Service Location Protocol [2].\n"
- title: 3. Address Specification for IPv6 Addresses in URLs
  contents:
  - "3. Address Specification for IPv6 Addresses in URLs\n   Whenever possible the\
    \ DNS [5] name of the service should be used\n   rather than the numerical representation\
    \ described in this section.\n   Service Location allows the use of the protocol\
    \ without the benefit\n   of DNS.  This is relevant when a group of systems is\
    \ connected to\n   build a network without any previous configuration of servers\
    \ to\n   support this network.  When Service Location is used in this manner,\n\
    \   numerical addresses must be used to identify the location of\n   services.\n\
    \   The format of a \"service:\" URL is defined in [6].  This URL is an\n   \"\
    absolute URI\" as defined by [7].\n   A numerical IPv6 address, such as may be\
    \ used in a \"service:\" URL, is\n   specified as in [8].  The textual representation\
    \ defined for literal\n   IPv6 addresses in [9]:\n      ipv6-addr  =  \"[\" num-addr\
    \ \"]\"\n      num-addr   =  ; Text represented IPv6 address syntax is as\n  \
    \                  ; specified in RFC 2373 [8], Section 2.2,\n   Examples:\n \
    \     This is a site-local scoped address, as could be used in a SLP\n      DAAdvert\
    \ message.\n         service:directory-agent://[FEC0::323:A3F9:25ff:fe91:109D]\n\
    \      This is a link-local scoped address, as could be used by a SA to\n    \
    \  advertise its service on a IPv6 network with no routers or DNS\n      service.\n\
    \         service:printer:ipp://[FE80::a15A:93ff:fe5D:B098]:8080/path\n"

  contents:
  - "4. SLP multicast and unicast behavior over IPv6\n   Section 4.1 describes how\
    \ different multicast addresses are used for\n   transmitting and receiving SLPv2\
    \ messages over IPv6.  Section 4.2\n   defines rules for the use of these addresses\
    \ and covers scoped\n   address issues in general.\n"
- title: 4.1 SLPv2 Multicast Group-IDs for IPv6
  contents:
  - "4.1 SLPv2 Multicast Group-IDs for IPv6\n   SLPv2 for IPv4 specifies only one\
    \ multicast address, relative to an\n   Administratively Scoped Address range\
    \ [11].  The reason only one\n   address was used is that there are only 256 relative\
    \ assignments\n   available for this purpose.  IPv6, on the other hand, has scoped\n\
    \   addresses and enough space for a range of assignments.\n   SLPv2 for IPv6\
    \ uses the following multicast group-id assignments:\n      FF0X:0:0:0:0:0:0:116\
    \     SVRLOC\n      FF0X:0:0:0:0:0:0:123     SVRLOC-DA\n      FF0X:0:0:0:0:0:1:1000\
    \    Service Location\n       -FF0X:0:0:0:0:0:1:13FF\n   These group-ids are combined\
    \ with the scope prefix of the scope to\n   which the multicast message is to\
    \ be sent.\n   The SVRLOC group-id is used for the following messages: Service\
    \ Type\n   Request and Attribute Request messages.\n   The SVRLOC-DA group-id\
    \ is used for multicast Service Requests for the\n   \"service:directory-agent\"\
    \ service type.  Also, DAs send unsolicited\n   DA Advert messages to the SVRLOC-DA\
    \ multicast group-id.\n   All other multicast Service Request messages are sent\
    \ to the\n   appropriate Service Location multicast group-id.  SAs join the groups\n\
    \   which correspond to the Service Types of the services they advertise.\n  \
    \ The group-id is determined using the algorithm provided in SLPv1 [3].\n   The\
    \ Service Type string used in the SrvRqst is hashed to a value from\n   0-1023.\
    \  This determines the offset into the FF0X::1:1000-13FF range.\n   The hash algorithm\
    \ is defined as follows:\n   An unsigned 32 bit value V is initialized to 0. \
    \ Each byte of the\n   Service Type UTF-8 [12] encoded string value is considered\n\
    \   consecutively.  The current value V is multiplied by 33, then the\n   value\
    \ of the current string byte is added.  Each byte in the Service\n   Type string\
    \ is processed in this manner.  The result is contained in\n   the low order 10\
    \ bits of V.  For example, the following code\n   implements this algorithm:\n\
    \      unsigned long slp_hash(const char *pc, unsigned int len) {\n          unsigned\
    \ long h = 0;\n          while (len-- != 0) {\n              h *= 33;\n      \
    \        h += *pc++;\n          }\n          return (0x3FF & h); /* round to a\
    \ range of 0-1023 */\n      }\n"
- title: 4.2 SLPv2 Scoping Rules for IPv6
  contents:
  - "4.2 SLPv2 Scoping Rules for IPv6\n   IPv6 provides different scopes for interface\
    \ address configuration\n   and multicast addresses.  A SLPv2 Agent might discover\
    \ services that\n   it cannot use or not discover services which it could use\
    \ unless\n   rules are given to prevent this.\n   Say a SLPv2 UA, for example,\
    \ could request a service using site-local\n   scope multicast and obtain a service:\
    \ URL containing a link-local\n   literal address.  If the service referred to\
    \ were not on the same\n   link as the SLPv2 UA, the service could not be reached.\n"
- title: 4.2.1 Joining SLPv2 Multicast Groups
  contents:
  - "4.2.1 Joining SLPv2 Multicast Groups\n   A SLPv2 Agent MAY send a multicast message\
    \ using any scope which it\n   is allowed to (see section 4.2.2).  A SA and a\
    \ DA MUST join all\n   groups to which a SLPv2 Agent may send a message.  This\
    \ ensures that\n   the SA or DA will be able to receive all multicast messages.\n\
    \   Specifically, a SLPv2 Agent MUST NOT join a multicast group which has\n  \
    \ greater scope for an interface than it is configured with for use\n   with unicast.\
    \  For example, an interface which is only configured\n   with a link-local address\
    \ joins groups in scopes with FF01 and FF02.\n   If the interface is configured\
    \ with a site-local or global address,\n   the scope of all multicast groups joined\
    \ can be no greater than scope\n   FF05.  In this case, SLPv2 SAs and DAs MUST\
    \ join multicast groups in\n   all the following scopes: FF01 - FF05.\n   A DA\
    \ MUST join the SVRLOC-DA group to receive SrvRqst messages\n   requesting DAAdverts.\n\
    \   A SA MUST join the SVRLOC-DA group to receive DAAdvert messages.\n   A SA\
    \ MUST join the groups from the Service Location range of group-\n   ids to receive\
    \ SrvRqst messages.  The SA only joins those groups\n   corresponding to services\
    \ it advertises.  For example, a service\n   agent which responds to requests\
    \ for \"service:service-agent\" (used\n   for SA discovery), would join groups\
    \ with the group-id derived from\n   the hash function defined in section 4.1:\n\
    \   group-id to join = slp_hash(\"service:service-agent\") + base address\n  \
    \                  = 0x01d8 + FF0X:0:0:0:0:0:1:1000\n                    = FF0X:0:0:0:0:0:1:11d8\n\
    \   The SA MAY join the SVRLOC group in order to receive SrvTypeRqst and\n   AttrRqst\
    \ messages; these features are OPTIONAL for the SA to\n   implement.\n   A UA\
    \ MAY join the SVRLOC-DA group at any or all of these scopes in\n   order to receive\
    \ DAAdvert messages.\n"

  contents:
  - "4.2.4 SLPv2 Agents with multiple interfaces\n   A scope zone, or a simply a zone,\
    \ is a connected region of topology\n   of a given scope.  For example, the set\
    \ of links connected by routers\n   within a particular site, and the interfaces\
    \ attached to those links,\n   comprise a single zone of site-local scope.  To\
    \ understand the\n   distinction between scopes and zones, observe that the topological\n\
    \   regions within two different sites are considered to be two DIFFERENT\n  \
    \ zones, but of the SAME scope.\n   A host which has multiple interfaces attached\
    \ to different links is\n   by definition is attached to two link-local zones.\
    \  A host may also\n   be attached to multiple zones of other scopes.\n   A SLPv2\
    \ Agent MUST NOT propagate service advertisements from one zone\n   to another.\
    \  Another way of saying this is a SLPv2 SA or DA MUST NOT\n   respond to a request\
    \ from one zone with service information\n   associated with a service in a different\
    \ zone.\n   The specific implication of these rules is discussed in the sections\n\

    \ multihomed.  The UA can issue a service request\n   in Zone 1 and discover services\
    \ on the SA or in Zone 2 and discover\n   services advertised by the DA.  For\
    \ example, if the request is issued\n   from a link-local source address, the\
    \ SA will only reply with a\n   service available on link 1, the DA only with\
    \ a service available on\n   link 2.\n   The UA MUST use active discovery to detect\
    \ DAs before issuing\n   multicast requests, as per SLPv2 [2].  The UA MUST issue\
    \ requests\n   using increasing multicast scopes starting at FF01 and increasing\
    \ to\n   a maximum scope of FF05, to solicit DAAdvertisements.  Note the\n   restrictions\
    \ in Section 4.2.2.\n   If the UA is unable to discover any DAs using multicast\
    \ discovery, it\n   may issue site-local scope (FF05) or less multicast requests.\
    \  (Note\n   that the source address of the request must be of at least the scope\n\

    \ 2 (Zone 2).  The SA MUST NOT\n   send a service registration to the DA for a\
    \ service which is present\n   in Zone 1.  The SA MUST register a service with\
    \ the DA which is\n   present in Zone 2.\n   The SA MUST NOT include an address\
    \ in a SAAdvert message which is\n   sent on a zone where the address is not valid.\
    \  For example, the SA\n   MUST NOT send a SAAdvert onto link 2, if the SAADvert\
    \ contains a\n   service: URL with a literal link-local scoped IPv6 address for\
    \ Link\n   1.\n   The SA performs active DA discovery, as described in SLPv2 [2].\
    \  The\n   SA MUST issue requests using multicast scope FF02 to solicit\n   DAAdvertisements.\
    \  If the SA has a site-local or global source\n   address, it MUST reissue the\
    \ request with increasing scopes up to a\n   maximum scope of FF05.  Active DA\

    \ source addresses, unless it is only\n   configured with a link-local address.\
    \  In that case, the DA MUST\n   issue DAAdverts with link-local scope only.\n\
    \   The DA URL MUST contain the address of the greatest scope the DA is\n   configured\

    \ was\n   previously assigned by IANA in RFC 2375 for use by SLP [10].\n   This\
    \ document defines how the range of addresses FF0X::1:1000 -\n   FF0X::1:13FF\
    \ is used.  IANA has assigned this range of addresses for\n   use by Service Location\
    \ Protocol.\n   This document fully defines the multicast addresses that this\n\
    \   protocol will use.  There is no requirement for the IANA to establish\n  \
    \ a registry to assign additional addresses.\n"

  - "6. Security Considerations\n   User Agents and Directory Agents MAY ignore all\
    \ unauthenticated\n   Service Location messages when a valid IPSec association\
    \ exists.\n   Service Agents and Directory Agents MUST be able to use the IP\n\
    \   Authentication and IP Encapsulating Security Payload for issuing and\n   processing\
    \ Service Location messages whenever an appropriate IPSec\n   Security Association\
    \ exists [13].\n   SLP allows digital signatures to be produced to allow the\n\
    \   verification of the contents of messages.  There is nothing in the\n   Modifications\
    \ for IPv6 document which weakens or strengthens this\n   technique.\n"
