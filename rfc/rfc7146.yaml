  - "1.  Introduction\n   [RFC3723] specifies IPsec requirements for block storage\
    \ protocols\n   over IP (e.g., iSCSI [RFC3720]) based on IPsec v2 ([RFC2401] and\n\
    \   related RFCs); those requirements have subsequently been applied to\n   remote\
    \ direct data placement protocols, e.g., RDMAP [RFC5040].  This\n   document updates\
    \ RFC 3723's IPsec requirements to IPsec v3 ([RFC4301]\n   and related RFCs) to\
    \ reflect developments since RFC 3723 was\n   published.\n   For brevity, this\
    \ document uses the term \"block storage protocols\" to\n   refer to all protocols\
    \ to which RFC 3723's requirements apply; see\n   Section 1.3 for details.\n \
    \  In addition to the IPsec v2 requirements in RFC 3723, IPsec v3, as\n   specified\
    \ in [RFC4301] and related RFCs (e.g., IKEv2 [RFC5996]),\n   SHOULD be implemented\
    \ for block storage protocols.  Retention of the\n   mandatory requirement for\
    \ IPsec v2 provides interoperability with\n   existing implementations, and the\
    \ strong recommendation for IPsec v3\n   encourages implementers to move forward\
    \ to that newer version of\n   IPsec.\n   Cryptographic developments since the\
    \ publication of RFC 3723\n   necessitate changes to the encryption transform\
    \ requirements for\n   IPsec v2, as explained further in Section 2.2; these updated\n\
    \   requirements also apply to IPsec v3.\n   Block storage protocols can be expected\
    \ to operate at high data rates\n   (multiple gigabits/second).  The cryptographic\
    \ requirements in this\n   document are strongly influenced by that expectation;\
    \ an important\n   example is that Triple Data Encryption Standard Cipher Block\
    \ Chaining\n   (3DES CBC) is no longer recommended for block storage protocols\
    \ due\n   to the frequent rekeying impacts of 3DES's 64-bit block size at high\n\
    \   data rates.\n"

  contents:
  - "1.2.  Summary of Changes to RFC 3723\n   This document makes the following changes\
    \ to RFC 3723:\n   o  Adds requirements that IPsec v3 SHOULD be implemented\n\
    \      (Encapsulating Security Payload (ESPv3) and IKEv2) in addition to\n   \
    \   IPsec v2 (see Section 1).\n   o  Requires extended sequence numbers for both\
    \ ESPv2 and ESPv3 (see\n      Section 2).\n   o  Clarifies key-size requirements\
    \ for AES CBC MAC with XCBC\n      extensions (MUST implement 128-bit keys; see\
    \ Section 2.1).\n   o  Adds IPsec v3 requirements for AES Galois Message Authentication\n\
    \      Code (GMAC) and Galois/Counter Mode (GCM) (SHOULD implement when\n    \
    \  IKEv2 is supported; see Sections 2.1 and 2.2).\n   o  Removes implementation\
    \ requirements for 3DES CBC and AES in\n      Counter mode (AES CTR) (changes\
    \ requirements for both to \"MAY\n      implement\").  Adds a \"MUST implement\"\
    \ requirement for AES CBC (see\n      Section 2.2).\n   o  Adds specific IKEv2\
    \ implementation requirements (see Section 3).\n   o  Removes the requirement\
    \ that IKEv1 use UDP port 500 (see\n      Section 3).\n   o  Allows the use of\
    \ the Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) in\n      addition to Certificate\
    \ Revocation Lists (CRLs) to check\n      certificates, and changes the Diffie-Hellman\

- title: 2.  ESP Requirements
  contents:
  - "2.  ESP Requirements\n   RFC 3723 requires that implementations MUST support\
    \ IPsec ESPv2\n   [RFC2406] in tunnel mode as part of IPsec v2 to provide security\
    \ for\n   both control packets and data packets; and that when ESPv2 is\n   utilized,\
    \ per-packet data origin authentication, integrity, and\n   replay protection\
    \ MUST be provided.\n   This document modifies RFC 3723 to require that implementations\n\
    \   SHOULD also support IPsec ESPv3 [RFC4303] in tunnel mode as part of\n   IPsec\
    \ v3 to provide security for both control packets and data\n   packets; per-packet\
    \ data origin authentication, integrity, and replay\n   protection MUST be provided\
    \ when ESPv3 is utilized.\n   At the high speeds at which block storage protocols\

    \ rapidly\n   exhaust the ESP 32-bit sequence number space, requiring frequent\n\
    \   rekeying of the SA, as rollover of the ESP sequence number within a\n   single\
    \ SA is prohibited for both ESPv2 [RFC2406] and ESPv3 [RFC4303].\n   In order\
    \ to provide the means to avoid this potentially undesirable\n   frequent rekeying,\
    \ implementations that are capable of operating at\n   speeds of 1 gigabit/second\
    \ or higher MUST implement extended (64-bit)\n   sequence numbers for ESPv2 (and\

- title: 2.2.  Confidentiality Transform Requirements
  contents:
  - "2.2.  Confidentiality Transform Requirements\n   RFC 3723 requires that:\n  \
    \ o  3DES in CBC mode (3DES CBC) [RFC2451] [triple-des-spec] MUST be\n      supported.\n\
    \   o  AES in Counter mode (AES CTR) [RFC3686] SHOULD be supported.\n   o  NULL\
    \ encryption [RFC2410] MUST be supported.\n   The above requirements from RFC\
    \ 3723 regarding 3DES CBC and AES CTR\n   are replaced in this document by requirements\
    \ that both 3DES CBC and\n   AES CTR MAY be implemented.  The NULL encryption\
    \ requirement is not\n   changed by this document.  The 3DES CBC requirement matched\
    \ the basic\n   encryption interoperability requirement for IPsec v2.  At the\
    \ time of\n   RFC 3723's publication, AES in Counter mode was the encryption\n\
    \   transform that was most amenable to hardware implementation, as\n   hardware\
    \ implementation may be preferable for the high data rates at\n   which block\
    \ storage protocols can be expected to operate.  This\n   document changes both\
    \ of these requirements, based on cryptographic\n   developments since the publication\
    \ of RFC 3723.\n   The requirement for 3DES CBC has become problematic due to\
    \ 3DES's\n   64-bit block size; i.e., the core cipher encrypts or decrypts 64\
    \ bits\n   at a time.  Security weaknesses in encryption start to appear as the\n\
    \   amount of data encrypted under a single key approaches the birthday\n   bound\
    \ of 32 GiB (gibibytes) for a cipher with a 64-bit block size;\n   see Appendix\
    \ A and [triple-des-birthday].  It is prudent to rekey\n   well before that bound\
    \ is reached, and 32 GiB or some significant\n   fraction thereof is less than\
    \ the amount of data that a block storage\n   protocol may transfer in a single\
    \ session.  This may require frequent\n   rekeying, e.g., to obtain an order-of-magnitude\
    \ (10x) safety margin\n   by rekeying after 3 GiB on a multi-gigabit/sec link.\
    \  In contrast,\n   AES has a 128-bit block size, which results in a much larger\
    \ birthday\n   bound (2^68 bytes); see Appendix A.  AES CBC [RFC3602] is the primary\n\
    \   mandatory-to-implement encryption transform for interoperability and\n   hence\
    \ is the appropriate mandatory-to-implement transform replacement\n   for 3DES\
    \ CBC.\n   AES in Counter mode (AES CTR) is no longer the encryption transform\n\
    \   that is most amenable to hardware implementation.  That\n   characterization\
    \ now applies to AES GCM [RFC4106], which provides\n   both encryption and integrity\
    \ protection in a single cryptographic\n   mechanism (in contrast, neither HMAC-SHA1\
    \ nor AES CBC MAC with XCBC\n   extensions is well suited for hardware implementation,\
    \ as both\n   transforms do not pipeline well).  AES GCM is also capable of\n\
    \   providing confidentiality protection for the IKEv2 key exchange\n   protocol,\
    \ but not the IKEv1 protocol [RFC5282], and therefore the new\n   AES GCM \"SHOULD\"\
    \ requirement is based on the presence of support for\n   IKEv2.\n   For the reasons\
    \ described in the preceding paragraphs, the\n   confidentiality transform requirements\
    \ in RFC 3723 are replaced by\n   the following:\n   o  3DES in CBC mode MAY be\
    \ implemented (replaces RFC 3723's \"MUST\n      implement\" requirement).\n \
    \  o  AES in Counter mode (AES CTR) MAY be implemented (replaces\n      RFC 3723's\
    \ \"SHOULD implement\" requirement).\n   o  AES in CBC mode MUST be implemented.\
    \  AES CBC implementations MUST\n      support 128-bit keys and MAY support other\
    \ key sizes.\n   o  Implementations that support IKEv2 SHOULD also implement AES\
    \ GCM.\n      AES GCM implementations MUST support 128-bit keys and MAY support\n\
    \      other key sizes.\n   o  NULL encryption [RFC2410] MUST be supported.\n\
    \   The requirement for support of NULL encryption enables the use of SAs\n  \
    \ that provide data origin authentication and data integrity, but not\n   confidentiality.\n\
    \   Other transforms MAY be implemented in addition to those listed\n   above.\n"
- title: 3.  IKEv1 and IKEv2 Requirements
  contents:
  - "3.  IKEv1 and IKEv2 Requirements\n   Note: To avoid ambiguity, the original IKE\
    \ protocol [RFC2409] is\n   referred to as \"IKEv1\" in this document.\n   This\
    \ document adds requirements for IKEv2 usage with block storage\n   protocols\
    \ and makes the following two changes to the IKEv1\n   requirements in RFC 3723\
    \ (the new Diffie-Hellman (DH) group\n   requirement also applies to IKEv2):\n\
    \   o  When DH groups are used, a DH group of at least 2048 bits SHOULD\n    \
    \  be offered as a part of all proposals to create IPsec security\n      associations.\
    \  The recommendation for the use of 1024-bit DH\n      groups with 3DES CBC and\
    \ HMAC-SHA1 has been removed; the use of\n      1024-bit DH groups is NOT RECOMMENDED,\
    \ and\n   o  The requirement to use UDP port 500 is removed in order to allow\n\
    \      NAT traversal [RFC3947].\n   There are no other changes to RFC 3723's IKEv1\
    \ requirements, but many\n   of them are restated in this document in order to\
    \ provide context for\n   the new IKEv2 requirements.\n   RFC 3723 requires that\
    \ IKEv1 [RFC2409] be supported for peer\n   authentication, negotiation of security\
    \ associations, and key\n   management, using the IPsec domain of interpretation\
    \ (DOI) [RFC2407],\n   and further requires that manual keying not be used since\
    \ it does not\n   provide the rekeying support necessary for operation at high\
    \ data\n   rates.  This document adds a requirement that IKEv2 [RFC5996] SHOULD\n\
    \   be supported for peer authentication, negotiation of security\n   associations,\
    \ and key management.  The prohibition of manual keying\n   as stated in RFC 3723\
    \ is extended to IKEv2; manual keying MUST NOT be\n   used with any version of\
    \ IPsec for protocols to which the\n   requirements in this document apply.\n\
    \   RFC 3723's requirements for IKEv1 mode implementation and usage are\n   unchanged;\
    \ this document does not extend those requirements to IKEv2\n   because IKEv2\
    \ does not have modes.\n   When IPsec is used, the receipt of an IKEv1 Phase 2\
    \ delete message or\n   an IKEv2 INFORMATIONAL exchange that deletes the SA SHOULD\
    \ NOT be\n   interpreted as a reason for tearing down the block storage protocol\n\
    \   connection (e.g., TCP-based).  If additional traffic is sent, a new\n   SA\
    \ will be created to protect that traffic.\n   The method used to determine whether\
    \ a block storage protocol\n   connection should be established using IPsec is\
    \ regarded as an issue\n   of IPsec policy administration and thus is not defined\
    \ in this\n   document.  The method used by an implementation that supports both\n\
    \   IPsec v2 and v3 to determine which versions of IPsec are supported by\n  \
    \ a block storage protocol peer is also regarded as an issue of IPsec\n   policy\
    \ administration and thus is also not defined in this document.\n   If both IPsec\
    \ v2 and v3 are supported by both endpoints of a block\n   storage protocol connection,\
    \ the use of IPsec v3 is RECOMMENDED.\n"

    \ using a pre-shared cryptographic key MUST be\n       supported.  Certificate-based\
    \ peer authentication using digital\n       signatures MAY be supported.  For\

    \ methods specified\n       in Sections 5.2 and 5.3 of [RFC2409] SHOULD NOT be\
    \ used.\n   b.  When digital signatures are used for authentication, all IKEv1\n\
    \       and IKEv2 negotiators SHOULD use Certificate Request Payload(s)\n    \
    \   to specify the certificate authority and SHOULD check the\n       certificate\

    \ IP Address Range,\n       ID_DER_ASN1_DN, and ID_DER_ASN1_GN Identification\
    \ Types SHOULD\n       NOT be used.  The ID_KEY_ID Identification Type MUST NOT\
    \ be used.\n   f.  When IKEv2 is supported, the following identification\n   \
    \    requirements apply.  ID_IPV4_ADDR, ID_IPV6_ADDR (if the protocol\n      \
    \ stack supports IPv6), and ID_FQDN Identification Types MUST be\n       supported;\
    \ ID_RFC822_ADDR SHOULD be supported.  The\n       ID_DER_ASN1_DN and ID_DER_ASN1_GN\
    \ Identification Types SHOULD NOT\n       be used.  The ID_KEY_ID Identification\
    \ Type MUST NOT be used.\n   The reasons for the identification requirements in\
    \ items e and f\n   above are as follows:\n   o  IP Subnet and IP Address Range\
    \ are too broad to usefully identify\n      an iSCSI endpoint.\n   o  The _DN\
    \ and _GN types are X.500 identities; it is usually better\n      to use an identity\
    \ from subjectAltName in a PKI certificate.\n   o  ID_KEY_ID is an opaque identifier\
    \ that is not interoperable among\n      different IPsec implementations as specified.\
    \  Heterogeneity in\n      some block storage protocol implementations can be\
    \ expected (e.g.,\n      iSCSI initiator vs. iSCSI target implementations), and\
    \ hence\n      heterogeneity among IPsec implementations is important.\n"

  - "3.2.  DH Group and PRF Requirements\n   This document does not change the support\
    \ requirements for Diffie-\n   Hellman (DH) groups and Pseudo-Random Functions\
    \ (PRFs).  See\n   [RFC4109] for IKEv1 requirements and [RFC4307] for IKEv2\n\
    \   requirements.  Implementers are advised to check for subsequent RFCs\n   that\
    \ update either of these RFCs, as such updates may change these\n   requirements.\n\
    \   When DH groups are used, a DH group of at least 2048 bits SHOULD be\n   offered\
    \ as a part of all proposals to create IPsec security\n   associations for both\
    \ IKEv1 and IKEv2.\n   RFC 3723 requires that support for perfect forward secrecy\
    \ in the\n   IKEv1 Quick Mode key exchange MUST be implemented.  This document\n\
    \   extends that requirement to IKEv2; support for perfect forward\n   secrecy\
    \ in the CREATE_CHILD_SA key exchange MUST be implemented for\n   the use of IPsec\
    \ with block storage protocols.\n"

  contents:
  - "4.  Security Considerations\n   This entire document is about security.\n   The\
    \ security considerations sections of all of the referenced RFCs\n   apply, and\
    \ particular note should be taken of the security\n   considerations for the encryption\
    \ transforms whose requirement levels\n   are changed by this RFC:\n   o  AES\
    \ GMAC [RFC4543] (new requirement -- SHOULD be supported when\n      IKEv2 is\
    \ supported),\n   o  3DES CBC [RFC2451] (changed from \"MUST be supported\" to\
    \ \"MAY be\n      supported\"),\n   o  AES CTR [RFC3686] (changed from \"SHOULD\
    \ be supported\" to \"MAY be\n      supported\"),\n   o  AES CBC [RFC3602] (new\
    \ requirement -- MUST be supported), and\n   o  AES GCM [RFC4106] (new requirement\
    \ -- SHOULD be supported when\n      IKEv2 is supported).\n   Of particular interest\
    \ are the security considerations concerning the\n   use of AES GCM [RFC4106]\
    \ and AES GMAC [RFC4543]; both modes are\n   vulnerable to catastrophic forgery\
    \ attacks if a nonce is ever\n   repeated with a given key.\n   The requirement\
    \ level for 3DES CBC has been reduced, based on\n   considerations for high-speed\
    \ implementations; 3DES CBC remains an\n   optional encryption transform that\
    \ may be suitable for\n   implementations limited to operating at lower speeds\
    \ where the\n   required rekeying frequency for 3DES is acceptable.\n   The requirement\
    \ level for AES CTR has been reduced, based solely on\n   hardware implementation\
    \ considerations that favor AES GCM, as opposed\n   to changes in AES CTR's security\
    \ properties.  AES CTR remains an\n   optional security transform that is suitable\
    \ for use in general, as\n   it does not share 3DES CBC's requirement for frequent\
    \ rekeying when\n   operating at high data rates.\n   Key sizes with comparable\
    \ strength SHOULD be used for the\n   cryptographic algorithms and transforms\
    \ for any individual IPsec\n   security association.  See Section 5.6 of [SP800-57]\
    \ for further\n   discussion.\n"
