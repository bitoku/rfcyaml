  contents:
  - "Abstract\n   This document describes an extension to vCard to support Instant\n\
    \   Messaging (IM) and Presence Protocol (PP) applications.  IM and PP\n   are\
    \ becoming increasingly common ways of communicating, and users\n   want to save\
    \ this contact information in their address books.  It\n   allows a URI that is\
    \ associated with IM or PP to be specified inside\n   a vCard.\n"

  contents:
  - "1.  Overview\n   As more and more people use various instant messaging (IM) and\n\
    \   presence protocol (PP) applications, it becomes important for them to\n  \
    \ be able to share this contact address information, along with the\n   rest of\
    \ their contact information.  RFC 2425 [1] and RFC 2426 [2]\n   define a standard\
    \ format for this information, which is referred to\n   as vCard.  This document\
    \ defines a new type in a vCard for\n   representing instant IM and PP URIs. \
    \ It is very similar to existing\n   types for representing email address and\
    \ telephone contact\n   information.\n   The type entry to hold this new contact\
    \ information is an IMPP type.\n   The IMPP entry has a single URI (see RFC 3986\
    \ [3]) that indicates the\n   address of a service that provides IM, PP, or both.\
    \  Also defined are\n   some parameters that give hints as to when certain URIs\
    \ would be\n   appropriate.  A given vCard can have multiple IMPP entries, but\
    \ each\n   entry can contain only one URI.  Each IMPP entry can contain multiple\n\
    \   parameters.  Any combination of parameters is valid, although a\n   parameter\
    \ should occur, at most, once in a given IMPP entry.\n   The type of URI indicates\
    \ what protocols might be usable for\n   accessing it, but this document does\
    \ not define any of the types.\n   For example, a URI type of\n   o  \"sip\" [5]\
    \ indicates to use SIP/SIMPLE,\n   o  \"xmpp\" [6] indicates to use XMPP,\n  \
    \ o  \"irc\" indicates to use IRC,\n   o  \"ymsgr\" indicates to use yahoo,\n\
    \   o  \"msn\" might indicate to use Microsoft messenger,\n   o  \"aim\" indicates\
    \ to use AOL, and\n   o  \"im\" [7] or \"pres\" [8] indicates that a CPIM or CPP\
    \ gateway should\n      be used.\n   The normative definition of this new vCard\
    \ type is given in Section\n   2, and an informational ABNF is provided in Section\
    \ 3.\n"

  - "2.  IANA Considerations\n   The required email to define this extension (as defined\
    \ in RFC 2425\n   [1]) was sent on October 29, 2004, to the ietf-mime-direct@imc.org\n\
    \   mailing list with the subject \"Registration of text/directory MIME\n   type\
    \ IMPP\" (see <http://www.imc.org/ietf-mime-direct/mail-\n   archive/msg00068.html>).\n\
    \   This specification updates the \"text/directory MIME Types\"\n   subregistry\
    \ in the \"text/directory MIME Registrations\" registry at\n   http://www.iana.org/assignments/text-directory-registrations\
    \ with the\n   following information:\n   Type name: IMPP\n   Type purpose: To\
    \ specify the URI for instant messaging and presence\n   protocol communications\
    \ with the object the vCard represents.\n   Type encoding: 8bit\n   Type value:\
    \ A single URI.  The type of the URI indicates the protocol\n   that can be used\
    \ for this contact.\n   Type special notes: The type may include the type parameter\
    \ \"TYPE\" to\n   specify an intended use for the URI.  The TYPE parameter values\n\
    \   include one or more of the following:\n   o  An indication of the type of\
    \ communication for which this URI is\n      appropriate.  This can be a value\
    \ of PERSONAL or BUSINESS.\n   o  An indication of the location of a device associated\
    \ with this\n      URI.  Values can be HOME, WORK, or MOBILE.\n   o  The value\
    \ PREF indicates this is a preferred address and has the\n      same semantics\
    \ as the PREF value in a TEL type.\n   Additional information can be found in\
    \ RFC 4770.\n   Intended usage: COMMON\n"

  contents:
  - "3.  Formal Grammar\n   The following ABNF grammar [4] extends the grammar found\
    \ in RFC 2425\n   [1] (Section 5.8.2) and RFC 2426 [2] (Section 4).\n   ;For name=\"\

- title: 5.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "5.  Security Considerations\n   This does not introduce additional security issues\
    \ beyond the current\n   vCard specification.  It is worth noting that many people\
    \ consider\n   their presence information more sensitive than other address\n\
    \   information.  Any system that stores or transfers vCards needs to\n   carefully\
    \ consider the privacy issues around this information.\n"
