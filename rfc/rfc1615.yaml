- title: 1. New Functionality
  contents:
  - "1. New Functionality\n   Apart from the greater maturity of the standard and\
    \ the fact that it\n   makes proper use of the Presentation Layer, the principal\
    \ features of\n   most use to the European R&D world in X.400(88) not contained\
    \ in\n   X.400(84) are:\n    - A powerful mechanism for arbitrarily nested Distribution\n\
    \      Lists including the ability for DL owners to control access\n      to their\
    \ lists and to control the destination of nondelivery\n      reports. The current\
    \ endemic use of DLs in the research\n      community makes this a fundamental\
    \ requirement.\n    - The Message Store (MS) and its associated protocol, P7.\
    \ The\n      Message Store provides a server for remote User Agents (UAs)\n  \
    \    on Workstations and PCs enabling messages to be held for\n      their recipient,\
    \ solving the problems of non-continuous\n      availability and variability of\
    \ network addresses of such\n      UAs. It provides powerful selection mechanisms\
    \ allowing the\n      user to select messages from the store to be transferred\
    \ to\n      the workstation/PC. This facility is not catered for\n      adequately\
    \ by the P3 protocol of X.400(84) and provides a\n      major incentive for transition.\n\
    \    - Use of X.500 Directories. Support for use of Directory Names\n      in\
    \ MHS will allow a transition from use of O/R Addresses to\n      Directory Names\
    \ when X.500 Directories become widespread,\n      thus removing the need for\
    \ users to know about MHS\n      topological addressing components.\n    - The\
    \ provision of message Security services including\n      authentication, confidentiality,\
    \ integrity and non-\n      repudiation as well as secure access between MHS components\n\
    \      may be important for a section of the research community.\n    - Redirection\
    \ of messages, both by the recipient if\n      temporarily unable to receive them,\
    \ and by the originator in\n      the event of failure to deliver to the intended\
    \ recipient.\n    - Use of additional message body encodings such as ISO 8613\n\
    \      ODA (Office Document Architecture) reformattable documents or\n      proprietary\
    \ word processor formats.\n    - Physical Delivery services that cater for the\
    \ delivery of an\n      electronic message on a physical medium (such as paper)\n\
    \      through the normal postal delivery services to a recipient\n      who (presumably)\
    \ does not use electronic mail.\n    - The use of different body parts. In addition\
    \ to the\n      extensible externally defined body parts, the most common\n  \
    \    types are predefined in the standard.  In order to give end-\n      users\
    \ a real advantage as compared to other technologies, the\n      following body-parts\
    \ should be supported as a minimum:\n         - IA5\n         - Message\n    \
    \     - G3FAX\n         - External\n            - General Text\n            -\
    \ Others\n      The last bullet should be interpreted as follows: all UAs\n  \
    \    should be configurable to use any type of externally defined\n      body\
    \ part, but as a minimum General Text can be generated and\n      read.\n    -\
    \ The use of extended character sets, both in O/R addresses\n      and in the\
    \ General Text extended bodypart. As a minimum, the\n      character sets as described\
    \ in the European profiles will be\n      supported. A management domain may choose\
    \ as an internal\n      matter which character sets it wants to support in\n \
    \     generating, but all user agents must be able to copy (in\n      local address\
    \ books and in replies) any O/R address, even if\n      it contains character\
    \ sets it cannot interpret itself.\n"
- title: 2. OSI Supporting Layers
  contents:
  - "2. OSI Supporting Layers\n   The development of OSI Upper Layer Architecture\
    \ since 1984 allows the\n   new MHS standards to sit on the complete OSI stack,\
    \ unlike X.400(84).\n   A new definition of the Reliable Transfer Service (RTS),\
    \ ISO 9066,\n   has a mode of operation, Normal-mode, which uses ACSE and the\
    \ OSI\n   Presentation Layer. It also defines another mode compatible with\n \
    \  X.410(84) RTS that was intended only for interworking with X.400(84)\n   systems.\n\
    \   However, there are differences between the conformance requirements\n   of\
    \ ISO MOTIS and CCITT X.400(88) for mandatory support for the\n   complete OSI\
    \ stack. ISO specify use of Normal-mode RTS as a mandatory\n   requirement with\
    \ X.410-mode RTS as an additional option, whereas\n   CCITT require X.410-mode\
    \ and have Normal-mode optional. The ISO\n   standard identifies three MTA types\
    \ to provide options in RTS modes:\n    - MTA Type A supports only Normal-mode\
    \ RTS, and provides\n      interworking within a PRMD and with other PRMDs (conforming\n\
    \      to ISO 10021), and with ADMDs which have complete\n      implementations\
    \ of X.400(88) or which conform to ISO 10021.\n    - MTA Type B adds to the functionality\
    \ of MTA type A the\n      ability to interwork with ADMDs implementing only the\
    \ minimal\n      requirements of X.400(88), by requiring support for X.410-\n\
    \      mode RTS in addition to Normal-mode.\n    - MTA Type C adds to the functionality\
    \ of MTA type B the\n      ability to interwork with external X.400(84) Management\n\
    \      Domains (MDs, i.e., PRMDs and ADMDs), by requiring support for\n      downgrading\
    \ (see 5.1) to the X.400(84) P1 protocol.\n   The interworking between ISO and\
    \ CCITT conformant systems is\n   summarised in the following table:\n       \
    \                               CCITT\n                            X.400(84) \

    \            Table 1: Interworking ISO <-> CCITT systems\n   The RTS conformance\
    \ difference would totally prevent interworking\n   between the two versions of\
    \ the standard if implementations never\n   contained more than the minimum requirements\
    \ for conformance, but in\n   practice many 88 implementations will be extensions\
    \ of 84 systems,\n   and will thus support both modes of RTS. (At the moment we\
    \ are aware\n   of only one product that doesn't support Normal mode.)\n   Both\
    \ ISO and CCITT standards require P7 (and P3) to be supported\n   directly over\
    \ the Remote Operations Service (ROS), ISO 9072, and use\n   Normal-mode presentation\
    \ (and not X.410-mode). Both allow optionally\n   ROS over RTS (in case the Transport\
    \ Service doesn't provide an\n   adequately reliable service), again using Normal-mode\
    \ and not X.410-\n   mode.\n   CCITT made both Normal and X.410 mode mandatory\
    \ in its X.400(92)\n   version, and it is expected that the 94 version will have\
    \ the X.410\n   mode as an option only.\n"
- title: 3. General Extension Mechanism
  contents:
  - "3. General Extension Mechanism\n   One of the major assets in ISO 10021/X.400(88)\
    \ is the extension\n   mechanism. This is used to carry most of the extensions\
    \ defined in\n   these standards, but its principal benefit will be in reducing\
    \ the\n   trauma of transitions to future versions of the standards. Provided\n\
    \   that implementations of the 88 standards do not try to place\n   restrictions\
    \ on the values that may be present, any future extension\n   will be relayed\
    \ by these implementations when appropriate (i.e., when\n   the extension is not\
    \ critical), thus providing a painless migration\n   to new versions of the standards.\n"

- title: 4.1. Mixed 84/88 Domains
  contents:
  - "4.1. Mixed 84/88 Domains\n   ISO 10021-6/X.419(88) defines rules for interworking\
    \ with X.400(84),\n   called downgrading. As X.400 specifies the interconnection\
    \ of MDs,\n   these rules define the actions necessary by an X.400(88) MD to\n\
    \   communicate with an X.400(84) MD. The interworking rules thus apply\n   at\
    \ domain boundaries. Although it would not be difficult to extend\n   these to\
    \ rules to convert Internal Trace formats which might be\n   thought a sufficient\
    \ addition to allow mixed X.400(84)/X.400(88)\n   domains, the problems involved\
    \ in attempting to define mixed 84/88\n   domains are not quite that simple.\n\
    \   The principle problem is in precisely defining the standard that\n   would\
    \ be used between MTAs within an X.400(84) domain, as X.400(84)\n   only defines\
    \ the interconnection of MDs. In practice, MTA\n   implementations either use\
    \ X.400(84) unmodified, or X.400(84) with\n   the addition of Internal Trace from\
    \ the first MOTIS DIS (DIS 8883),\n   or support MOTIS as defined in DIS 8505,\
    \ DIS 8883, and DIS 9065. The\n   second option is recommended in the NBS Implementors\
    \ Agreements, and\n   the third option is in conformance with the CEN/CENELEC\
    \ MHS\n   Functional Standard [1], which requires as a minimum tolerance of all\n\
    \   \"original MOTIS\" protocol extensions. An 84 MD must decide which of\n  \
    \ these options it will adopt, and then require all its MTAs to adopt\n   (or\
    \ at least be compatible with) this choice. No doubt this is one of\n   the reasons\
    \ for the almost total absence currently of mixed- vendor\n   X.400(84) MDs in\
    \ the European R&D MHS community. The fact that none\n   of these three options\
    \ for communication between MTAs within a domain\n   have any status within the\
    \ standardisation bodies accounts for the\n   absence from ISO 10021/X.400(88)\
    \ of detailed rules for interworking\n   within mixed 84/88 domains.\n   Use of\
    \ the first option, unmodified X.400(84), carries the danger of\n   undetectable\
    \ routing loops occurring. Although these can only occur\n   if MTAs have inconsistent\
    \ routing tables, the absence of standardised\n   methods of disseminating routing\
    \ information makes this a possibility\n   which if it occurred might cause severe\
    \ disruption before being\n   detected. The only addition to the interworking\
    \ rules needed for this\n   case is the deletion of Internal Trace when downgrading\
    \ a message.\n   Use of the second option, X.400(84) plus Internal Trace, allows\
    \ the\n   detection and prevention of routing loops. Details of the mapping\n\
    \   between original-MOTIS Internal Trace and the Internal Trace of ISO\n   10021\
    \ can be found in Annex A. This should be applied not only when\n   downgrading\
    \ from 88 to 84, but also in reverse when an 84 MPDU is\n   received by the 84/88\
    \ Interworking MTA. If the 84 domain properly\n   implements routing loop detection\
    \ algorithms, then this will allow\n   completely consistent reception of messages\
    \ by an 84 recipient even\n   after DL expansion or Redirection within that domain\
    \ (but see also\n   section 5.3).  Unfortunately, the first DIS MOTIS like X.400(84)\
    \ left\n   far too much to inference, so not all implementors may have\n   understood\
    \ that routing loop detection algorithms must only consider\n   that part of the\
    \ trace after the last redirection flag in the trace\n   sequence.\n   Use of\
    \ the third option, tolerance of all original-MOTIS extensions,\n   would in principle\
    \ allow a still higher level of interworking between\n   the 84 and 88 systems.\
    \ However, no implementations are known which do\n   more than relay the syntax\
    \ of original-MOTIS extensions: there is no\n   capability to generate these protocol\
    \ elements or ability to\n   correctly interpret their semantics.\n   The choice\
    \ between the first two options for mixed domains can be\n   left to individual\
    \ management domains. It has no impact on other\n   domains provided the topology\
    \ recommended in section 5 is adopted.\n"
- title: 4.2. Generation of OR-Name Extensions from X.400(84)
  contents:
  - "4.2. Generation of OR-Name Extensions from X.400(84)\n   The interworking rules\
    \ defined in DIS 10021-6/X.419 Annex B allow for\n   delivery of 88 messages to\
    \ 84 recipients, but do not make any 88\n   extensions available to 84 originators.\
    \ In general this is an\n   adequate strategy. Most 88 extensions provide optional\
    \ services or\n   have sensible defaults. The exception to this is the OR-Name\n\
    \   extensions. These fall into three categories: the new CommonName\n   attribute;\
    \ fifteen new attributes for addressing physical delivery\n   recipients; and\
    \ alternative Teletex (T.61) encodings for all\n   attributes that were defined\
    \ as Printable Strings. Without some\n   mechanism to generate these attributes,\
    \ 84 originators are unable to\n   address 88 recipients with OR-Addresses containing\
    \ these attributes.\n   Such a mechanism is defined in RARE Technical Report 3\
    \ ([2]), \"X.400\n   1988 to 1984 downgrading\".\n   Common-name appears likely\
    \ to be a widely used attribute because it\n   remedies a serious deficiency in\
    \ the X.400(84) OR-Name: it provides\n   an attribute suitable for naming Distribution\
    \ Lists and roles, and\n   even individuals where the constraints of the 84 personal-name\n\
    \   structure are inappropriate or undesirable. As 84 originators will no\n  \
    \ doubt wish to be able to address 88 DLs (and roles), [2] defines a\n   Domain\
    \ Defined Attribute (DDA) to enable generation of common-name by\n   84 originators.\
    \ This consists of a DDA with its type set to \"common-\n   name\" and its value\
    \ containing the Printable String encoding to be\n   set into the 88 common-name\
    \ attribute.\n   This requires that all European R&D MHS 88 MTAs capable of\n\
    \   interworking with 84 systems shall be able to map the value of\n   \"common-name\"\
    \ DDA in OR-Names received from 84 systems to the 88\n   standard attribute extension\
    \ component common-name, and vice versa.\n   X.400(84) originators will only be\
    \ able to make use of this ability\n   to address 88 common-name recipients if\
    \ their system is capable of\n   generating DDAs. Unfortunately, one of the many\
    \ serious deficiencies\n   with the CEN/CENELEC and CEPT 84 MHS Functional Standards\
    \ ([1] and\n   [3]), as originally published, is that this ability is not a\n\
    \   requirement for all conformant systems. Thus if existing European R&D\n  \
    \ MHS X.400(84) users wish to be able to address a significant part of\n   the\
    \ ISO 10021/X.400(84) world they must explicitly ensure that their\n   84 systems\
    \ are capable of generating DDAs. However, this will be a\n   requirement in the\
    \ revised versions of ENV 41201 and ENV 41202, which\n   are to be published soon.\
    \ There is no alternative mechanism for\n   providing this functionality to 84\
    \ users. It is estimated that\n   currently 95% of all European R&D MHS users\
    \ are able to generate\n   DDAs.\n   When messages are sent to both ISO 10021/X.400(88)\
    \ and X.400(84)\n   recipients outside the European R&D MHS community, this\n\
    \   representation of common-name will not enable the external recipients\n  \
    \ to communicate directly unless their 84/88 interworking MTA also\n   implements\
    \ this mapping. However, use of this mapping within the\n   European R&D MHS community\
    \ has not reduced external connectivity, and\n   provided RTR 3, RFC 1328 is universally\
    \ implemented within this\n   community it will enhance connectivity within the\
    \ community.\n   As for the new Physical Delivery address attributes in X.400(88),\
    \ RTR\n   3 (RFC1328) takes the following approach. A DDA with type \"X400-88\"\
    \n   is used, whose value is an std-or encoding of the address as defined\n  \
    \ in RARE Technical Report 2 ([4]), \"Mapping between X.400(1988)/ISO\n   10021\
    \ and RFC 822\". This allows source routing through an appropriate\n   gateway.\
    \ Where the generated address is longer than 128 characters,\n   up to three overflow\
    \ DDAs are used: X400-C1; X400-C2; X400-C3. This\n   solution is general, and\
    \ does not require co-operation, i.e., it can\n   be implemented in the gateways\
    \ only.\n   Note that the two DDA solutions mentioned above have the undesirable\n\
    \   property that the P2 heading will still contain the DDA form, unless\n   content\
    \ upgrading is also done. In order to shield the user from\n   cryptic DDAs, such\
    \ content upgrading is in general recommended, also\n   for nested forwarded messages,\
    \ even though the available standards\n   and profiles do not dictate this.\n"

  - "4.3. Distribution List Interworking with X.400(84)\n   Before all X.400(84) systems\

    \  these flags. Thus 88 systems allow a message to re-traverse an MD (or\n   be\
    \ relayed again by an MTA) after either DL-expansion or redirection.\n   However,\
    \ these flags cannot be included in X.400(84) trace, so are\n   deleted on downgrading.\
    \ Therefore the 84 DL recipient will receive\n   all messages sent to the DL except\
    \ those which had a common point in\n   the path to the DL expansion point with\
    \ the path from the expansion\n   points to his UA. This common point is an MD\
    \ in the case of a DL in\n   another MD or an MTA in the case of a DL in the same\
    \ MD. Although\n   this is quite deterministic behaviour, the user is unlikely\
    \ to\n   understand it and instead regard it as erratic or inconsistent\n   behaviour.\n\
    \   Another problem with X.400(84) DL members will be that delivery and\n   non-delivery\
    \ reports will be sent back directly to the originator of\n   a message, rather\
    \ than routed through the hierarchy of DL expansion\n   points where they could\
    \ have been routed to the DL administrator\n   instead of (or as well as) the\
    \ originator.\n   No general solution to this problem has yet been devised, despite\n\
    \   much thought from a number of experts. The nub of the problem is that\n  \
    \ changing the downgrading rules to enable 84 recipients to receive all\n   such\
    \ messages also allows the possibility of undetectable infinite DL\n   or redirection\
    \ looping where there is an 84 transit domain.\n   A potential solution is to\
    \ extend the DL expansion procedures to\n   explicitly identify X.400(84) recipients\
    \ and to treat them specially,\n   at least by deleting all trace prior to the\
    \ expansion point. This\n   solution is only dangerous if another DL reached through\
    \ an 84\n   transit domain is inadvertently configured as an 84 recipient, when\n\
    \   infinite looping could occur. It does however impose the problems of\n   84\
    \ interworking into MHS components which need to know nothing even\n   of the\
    \ existence of X.400(84). It also requires changes to the\n   Directory attribute\
    \ mhs-dl-members to accommodate the indication that\n   identifies the recipient\
    \ as an X.400(84) user, unless European R&D\n   MHS DLs are restricted to being\
    \ implemented by local tables rather\n   than making use of the Directory.\n \
    \  A similar change would be required for Redirection. However, the\n   change\
    \ for Redirection would have substantially more impact as it\n   would require\
    \ European R&D MHS-specific MHS protocol extensions to\n   identify the redirected\
    \ recipient as an X.400(84) user. If the\n   European R&D MHS adopts a reasonable\
    \ quality of MHS(88) service, all\n   its MTAs would be capable of Redirection\
    \ and all UAs would be capable\n   of requesting originator-specified-alternate-recipient\
    \ and thus be\n   required to incorporate these non-standard additions. A special\n\
    \   European R&D MHS modification affecting all MTAs and UAs seems\n   impractical,\
    \ too!\n   If the recommended European R&D MHS topology for MHS migration (See\n\
    \   chapter 5) is adopted there will never be an X.400(84) transit domain\n  \
    \ (or MTA) between two ISO 10021 systems. This allows the deletion of\n   trace\
    \ prior to the last DL expansion or redirection to be performed\n   as part of\
    \ the downgrading, giving the X.400(84) user a consistent\n   service. This solution\
    \ has the advantage of only requiring changes at\n   the convertors between X.400(84)\
    \ and ISO 10021/X.400(88), where other\n   European R&D MHS specific extensions\
    \ have also been identified. A\n   precise specification of this solution is given\
    \ in Annex A.\n   Finally, problems might occur because some X.400(84) MTAs could\n\
    \   object to messages containing more than one recipient with the same\n   extension-id\
    \ (called originally-requested-recipient-number in the new\n   standards), since\
    \ this was not defined in X.400(84).  Note that\n   X.400(84) only requires that\
    \ all extension-id's be different at\n   submission time, so 84 software that\
    \ does not except messages with\n   identical extension-id's for relaying or delivery\
    \ must be considered\n   broken.\n"
- title: 4.4. P2 Interworking
  contents:
  - "4.4. P2 Interworking\n   RTR 3, RFC 1328 also defines the downgrading rules for\
    \ P2 (IPM)\n   interworking: The IPM service in X.400(1984) is usually provided\
    \ by\n   content type 2. In many cases, it will be useful for a gateway to\n \
    \  downgrade P2 from content type 22 to 2. This will clearly need to be\n   made\
    \ dependent on the destination, as it is quite possible to carry\n   content type\
    \ 22 over P1(1984). The decision to make this downgrade\n   will be on the basis\
    \ of gateway configuration.\n   When a gateway downgrades from 22 to 2, the following\
    \ should be done:\n    1. Strip any 1988 specific headings (language indication,\
    \ and\n       partial message indication).\n    2. Downgrade all O/R addresses,\
    \ as described in Section 3.\n    3. If a directory name is present, there is\
    \ no method to\n       preserve the semantics within a 1984 O/R Address. However,\
    \ it\n       is possible to pass the information across, so that the\n       information\
    \ in the Distinguished Name can be informally\n       displayed to the end user.\
    \ This is done by appending a text\n       representation of the Distinguished\
    \ Name to the Free Form\n       Name enclosed in round brackets. It is recommended\
    \ that the\n       \"User Friendly Name\" syntax is used to represent the\n  \
    \     Distinguished Name [5]. For example:\n          (Steve Hardcastle-Kille,\
    \ Computer Science,\n          University College London, GB)\n    4. The issue\
    \ of body part downgrade is discussed in Section 6.\n   Note that a message represented\
    \ as content type 22 may have\n   originated from [6]. The downgrade for this\
    \ type of message can be\n   improved. This is discussed in RTR 2, RFC 1327.\n\
    \   Note that the newer EWOS/ETSI recommendations specify further rules\n   for\
    \ downgrading, which are not all completely compatible with the\n   rules in RTR\
    \ 3, RFC 1328. This paper does not state which set of\n   rules is preferred for\
    \ the European R&D MHS, it only states that a\n   choice will have to be made.\n\
    \   As the transition topology recommended for the European R&D MHS is to\n  \
    \ never use 84 transit systems between 88 systems, it is possible to\n   improve\
    \ on the P2 originator downgrading and resending scenario. The\n   absence of\
    \ 84 transit systems means that the necessity for a P1\n   downgrade implies that\
    \ the recipient is on an 84 system, and thus\n   that it is better to downgrade\
    \ 88 P2 contents to 84 P2 rather than to\n   relay it in the knowledge that it\
    \ will not be delivered.\n"
- title: 5. Topology for Migration
  contents:
  - "5. Topology for Migration\n   Having decided that a transition from X.400(84)\
    \ is appropriate, it is\n   necessary to consider the degree of planning and co-\
    \ ordination\n   required to preserve interworking during the transition.\n  \
    \ It is assumed as a fundamental tenet that interworking must be\n   preserved\
    \ during the transition. This requires that one or more\n   system in the European\
    \ R&D MHS community must act as a protocol\n   converter by implementing the rules\
    \ for \"Interworking with 1984\n   Systems\" listed in Annex B of ISO 10021-6/X.419.\n\
    \   When downgrading from ISO 10021/X.400(88) to X.400(84) all extensions\n  \
    \ giving functionality beyond X.400(84) are discarded, or if a critical\n   extension\
    \ is present then downgrading fails and a non-delivery\n   results. Thus, although\
    \ it is possible to construct topologies of\n   interconnected MTAs so that two\
    \ 88 MTAs can only communicate by\n   relaying through one or more 84 MTA, to\
    \ maximise the quality of\n   service which can be provided in the European R&D\
    \ MHS community it is\n   proposed that it require that no two European R&D MHS\
    \ 88 MTAs shall\n   need to communicate by relaying through a X.400(84) MTA. Furthermore,\n\
    \   if this is extended to require that no two European R&D MHS 88 MTAs\n   shall\
    \ ever communicate by relaying through an X.400(84) MTA, then the\n   European\
    \ R&D MHS can provide enhanced interworking functionality to\n   its X.400(84)\
    \ users.\n   If mixed vintage 88 and 84 Management Domains (MDs) are created,\
    \ the\n   routing loop detection rules, which specify that a message shall not\n\
    \   re-enter an MD it has previously traversed, require that downgrading\n   is\
    \ performed within that mixed vintage MD. That MD therefore requires\n   at least\
    \ one MTA capable of downgrading from 88 to 84. It is unlikely\n   that every\
    \ MTA within an MD will be configured to act as an entry-\n   point to that MD\
    \ from other MDs. However, the proposed European R&D\n   MHS migration topology\
    \ requires that as soon as a domain has an 88\n   MTA it shall also have an 88\
    \ entry point - this may, of course, be\n   that same MTA.\n   Even for MDs operating\
    \ all the same MHS vintage internally, providing\n   entry-points for both MHS\
    \ vintages will give considerable advantage\n   in maximising the connectivity\
    \ to other MDs. Initially, it will be\n   particularly important for 88 MDs to\
    \ be able to communicate with 84\n   only MDs, but as 88 becomes more widespread\
    \ eventually the 84 MDs\n   will become a minority for which the ability to support\
    \ 88 will be\n   important to maintain connectivity. For most practical MDs providing\n\
    \   entry-points that implement options in the supporting layers will\n   also\
    \ be important. Support for at least the following is recommended\n   at MD entry-points:\n\
    \    88-P1/Normal-mode RTS/CONS/X.25(84)\n    88-P1/Normal-mode RTS/RFC1006/TCP/IP\n\
    \    84-P1/X.25(80)\n    84-P1/RFC1006/TCP/IP\n   The above table omits layers\
    \ where the choice is obvious (e.g.,\n   Transport class zero), or where no choice\
    \ exists (e.g., RTS for 84-\n   P1).\n   The requirement for no intermediate 84\
    \ systems does require that the\n   European R&D MHS use direct PRMD to PRMD routing\
    \ between 88 PRMDs at\n   least until such time as all ADMDs will relay the 88\
    \ MHS protocols.\n   Finally, in order to keep routing co-ordination overhead\
    \ to a\n   minimum, an important requirement for the migration strategy is that\n\
    \   only one common set of routing procedures is used for both 84 and 88\n   systems\
    \ in the European R&D MHS.\n"

  - "6. Conclusion\n    1. The transition from X.400(84) to ISO 10021/X.400(88) is\n\
    \       worthwhile for the European R&D MHS, to provide:\n          - P7 Message\
    \ Store to support remote UAs.\n          - Distribution Lists.\n          - Support\
    \ for Directory Names.\n          - Standardised external Body Part types.\n \
    \         - Redirection.\n          - Security.\n          - Future extensibility.\n\
    \          - Physical Delivery.\n    2. To minimise the number of transitions\
    \ the European R&D MHS\n       target should be ISO 10021 rather than CCITT X.400(88)\
    \ -\n       i.e., straight to use of the full OSI stack with Normal-mode\n   \
    \    RTS.\n    3. To give a useful quality of service, the European R&D MHS\n\
    \       should not use minimal 88 MTAs which relay the syntax but\n       understand\
    \ none of the semantics of extensions. In\n       particular, all European R&D\
    \ MHS 88 MTAs should generate\n       reports containing extensions copied from\
    \ the subject message\n       and route reports through the DL expansion hierarchy\
    \ where\n       appropriate.\n    4. The European R&D MHS should carefully plan\
    \ the transition so\n       that it is never necessary to relay through an 84\
    \ system to\n       provide connectivity between any two 88 systems.\n    5. The\
    \ European R&D MHS should consider the additional\n       functionality that can\
    \ be provided to X.400(84) users by\n       adopting an enhanced specification\
    \ of the interworking rules\n       between X.400(84) and ISO 10021/X.400(88),\
    \ and weigh this\n       against the cost of building and maintaining its own\n\
    \       convertors. The advantages to X.400(84) users are:\n         - Ability\
    \ to generate 88 common-name attribute, likely to\n           be widely used for\
    \ naming DLs.\n         - Consistent reception of DL-expanded and Redirected\n\
    \           messages.\n         - Ability to receive extended 88 P2 contents\n\
    \           automatically downgraded to 84 P2.\n"
