Abstract This document records the transfer of responsibility for the Ethernet related MIB modules DOT3 OAM MIB, SNMP REPEATER MIB, POWER ETHERNET MIB, DOT3 EPON MIB, EtherLike MIB, EFM CU MIB, ETHER WIS, and MAU MIB from the IETF to the IEEE 802.3 Working Group (WG).
This document also describes the procedures associated with the transfer in a similar way to how RFC 4663 records the transfer of the IETF Bridge MIB work to the IEEE 802.1 WG.
Introduction [RFC4663], published in September 2006, described a plan for transferring responsibility for four MIB modules related to bridges from the IETF to IEEE 802.1.
Some years later, responsibility for eight more MIB modules was transferred from the IETF Ethernet Interfaces and Hub MIB (hubmib)
WG to the IEEE 802.3 WG.
The MIB modules concerned are tabulated below (Section 2).
[RFC4663] clearly enunciates the motivation for both transfers and also provides an introduction to IEEE standardization procedures.
The discussions of those topics will not be repeated here.
The IEEE version of this second lot of transferred MIB modules was published as 802.3.1 2011 in February 2011.
The IEEE 802.3.1 specification was subsequently updated.
The latest version, IEEE 802.3.1 2013
[IEEE802.3.1 2013], is the basis for this document.
IETF and Corresponding IEEE 802.3
This section tabulates the MIB modules that were transferred to IEEE 802.3, identifying the IETF source document, the corresponding clause of [IEEE802.3.1 2013], and the location of the MIB itself in ASCII format.

Procedural Aspects of the Transfer 3.1.
MIB Modules in ASCII Format
The content of Section 2.2 of [RFC4663] is also accurate for this document.
OID Registration for New MIB Modules
WG adopted the approach recommended in Section 2.3 of [RFC4663] of developing an IEEE MIB module and defining new compliance clauses under the IEEE OID branch.
Information about the IEEE 802.3 Management Registration Arcs can be found at <http://www.ieee802.org/3/arcs/index.html>. 3.3.
The Ethernet Interfaces and Hub MIB WG has completed its documents, and the WG was closed in September 2007.
The mailing list stayed open for a while and was closed a few years later.
The appropriate mailing list for IEEE 802.3
MIB modules discussion is STDS 802 3 MIB@LISTSERV.IEEE.ORG.
To see general information about 802.3, including how they work and how to participate, go to <http://www.ieee802.org/3/
The content of Section 5 of [RFC4663] is also accurate for this document, noting that from the point of view of the present document, 802.3 should replace 802.1 wherever it occurs in the text.
This document records the transfer of ownership of Ethernet related MIB modules to IEEE 802.3.1 several years ago.
The transfer has no security implications.
