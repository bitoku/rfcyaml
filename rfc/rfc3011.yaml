  - "1. Introduction\n   The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) [RFC2131]\
    \ provides a\n   framework for passing configuration information to hosts on a\
    \ TCP/IP\n   network.  RFC 2132 [RFC2132] specifies DHCP option configuration\n\
    \   information that may be carried in DHCP packets to/from the DHCP\n   server\
    \ and the DHCP client.  This document specifies a new DHCP\n   option.\n   To\
    \ select the subnet on which to allocate an address, the DHCP server\n   determines\
    \ the subnet from which the request originated, and then\n   selects an address\
    \ on the originating subnet or on a subnet that is\n   on the same network segment\
    \ as the originating subnet.  The subnet\n   from which the request originates\
    \ can be determined by:\n   o Using the subnet address of the giaddr field in\
    \ the DHCP packet\n     header, or if the giaddr field is zero;\n   o Using the\
    \ subnet address of the local interface on which the DHCP\n     server received\
    \ the packet.\n   This memo defines a new DHCP option, the subnet selection option,\n\
    \   which allows the DHCP client to specify the subnet on which to\n   allocate\
    \ an address.  This option takes precedence over the methods\n   that the DHCP\
    \ server uses to determine the subnet on which to select\n   an address.\n   The\
    \ key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n\
    \   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\",  \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in\
    \ this\n   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].\n"
- title: 1.1. Motivational Example
  contents:
  - "1.1. Motivational Example\n   An example of where this option could be useful\
    \ is in a device (e.g.:\n   a RAS device) that is allocating addresses on behalf\
    \ of its clients.\n   In this case the device would be allocating addresses through\
    \ DHCP\n   and then managing those addresses among its clients.\n   In this scenario,\
    \ the device is connected to a private \"internal\"\n   network on which the DHCP\
    \ server would be located.  The device is\n   also connected to one or more service\
    \ providing \"external\" networks\n   (i.e.: the networks that the device's clients\
    \ are connected to).\n   Furthermore, the internal network is not IP connected\
    \ to the external\n   networks, although inside the device there is connectivity\
    \ between\n   the internal and external networks (e.g.: though the backplane).\n\
    \   Recall that the device is allocating addresses for its clients on the\n  \
    \ external networks and that there is no IP connectivity between the\n   internal\
    \ network and the external networks.  The DHCP requests cannot\n   originate from\
    \ the external networks since packets cannot be routed\n   between the external\
    \ network and the internal network.  Thus, the\n   DHCP requests must originate\
    \ from the internal network.  The problem\n   with originating the DHCP requests\
    \ from the internal network is that\n   the DHCP server will allocate addresses\
    \ on the internal network's\n   subnet, when what is required are addresses on\
    \ the external subnets.\n   The subnet selection option provides a solution to\
    \ this problem.\n   The device would send its DHCP request on the internal subnet,\
    \ but\n   would include the subnet selection option containing the address of\n\
    \   the external subnet on which it requires the address.  The subnet\n   selection\
    \ option instructs the DHCP server to allocate the address on\n   the requested\
    \ subnet as opposed to the normal operation of allocating\n   the address on the\
    \ subnet from which the DHCP request originated.\n"
- title: 2. Subnet Selection Option Definition
  contents:
  - "2. Subnet Selection Option Definition\n   The subnet selection option is a DHCP\
    \ option.  The option contains a\n   single IPv4 address that is the address of\
    \ a subnet.  The value for\n   the subnet address is determined by taking any\
    \ IPv4 address on the\n   subnet and ANDing that address with the subnet mask\
    \ (i.e.: the\n   network and subnet bits are left alone and the remaining (address)\n\
    \   bits are set to zero).  When the DHCP server is configured to respond\n  \
    \ to this option, is allocating an address, and this option is present\n   then\
    \ the DHCP server MUST allocate the address on either:\n   o the subnet specified\
    \ in the subnet selection option, or;\n   o a subnet on the same network segment\
    \ as the subnet specified in the\n     subnet selection option.\n   The format\
    \ of the option is:\n        Code   Len        IPv4 Address\n       +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+\n\
    \       | 118 |  4  | A1  | A2  | A3  | A4  |\n       +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+\n\
    \   Servers configured to support this option MUST return an identical\n   copy\
    \ of the option to any client that sends it, regardless of whether\n   or not\
    \ the client requests the option in a parameter request list.\n   Clients using\
    \ this option MUST discard DHCPOFFER or DHCPACK packets\n   that do not contain\
    \ this option.\n   This option does not require changes to operations or features\
    \ of the\n   DHCP server other than to select the subnet on which to allocate\
    \ an\n   address.  For example, the handling of DHCPDISCOVER for an unknown\n\
    \   subnet should continue to operate unchanged.\n   When this option is present\
    \ and the server is configured to support\n   this option, the server MUST NOT\
    \ offer an address that is not on the\n   requested subnet or network segment.\
    \  Servers that do not understand\n   this option will allocate an address using\
    \ their normal algorithms\n   and will not return this option in the DHCPOFFER\
    \ or DHCPACK.  In this\n   case the client will discard the DHCPOFFER or DHCPACK.\
    \  Servers that\n   understand this option but are administratively configured\
    \ to ignore\n   the option MUST ignore the option, use their normal algorithms\
    \ to\n   allocate an address, and MUST NOT return this option in the DHCPOFFER\n\
    \   or DHCPACK.  In this case the client will discard the DHCPOFFER or\n   DHCPACK.\n\
    \   During an address renew, the DHCP server may send a DHCPACK directly\n   to\
    \ the allocated address, however packets from the DHCP server may\n   not be routable\
    \ to the address.  Thus, in all packets that the DHCP\n   client sends that contain\
    \ the subnet selection option, the giaddr\n   field in the BOOTP header MUST be\
    \ set to an IPv4 address on which the\n   DHCP client will accept DHCP packets\
    \ (e.g.: the address on the subnet\n   connected to the internal network).\n \
    \  The IPv4 address to which a DHCP server sends a reply to MUST be the\n   same\
    \ as it would chose when this option is not present.\n"

- title: 6. Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "6. Security Considerations\n   DHCP currently provides no authentication or security\
    \ mechanisms.\n   Potential exposures to attack are discussed is section 7 of\
    \ the\n   protocol specification [RFC2131].\n   The subnet selection option allows\
    \ for the DHCP client to specify the\n   subnet on which to allocate an address.\
    \  This would allow a client to\n   perform a more complete address-pool exhaustion\
    \ attack since the\n   client would no longer be restricted to attacking address-pools\
    \ on\n   just its local subnet.\n   Servers that implement the subnet selection\
    \ option MUST by default\n   disable use of the feature; it must specifically\
    \ be enabled through\n   configuration.  Moreover, a server SHOULD provide the\
    \ ability to\n   selectively enable use of the feature under restricted conditions,\n\
    \   e.g., by enabling use of the option only from explicitly configured\n   client-ids,\
    \ enabling its use only by clients on a particular subnet,\n   or restricting\
    \ the subnets (as indicated in the subnet selection\n   option) from which addresses\
    \ may be requested.\n"
