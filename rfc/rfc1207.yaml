  - "1. Introduction\n   During the last few months, several people have monitored\
    \ various\n   major mailing lists and have extracted questions that are important\n\
    \   or commonly asked.  This FYI RFC is one of two in a series of FYI's\n   which\
    \ present the questions and their answers.  The first FYI, FYI 4,\n   presented\
    \ questions new Internet users commonly ask and their\n   answers.\n   The goal\
    \ of this FYI is to codify the Internet lore so that network\n   operations staff,\
    \ especially for networks just joining the Internet,\n   will have an accurate\
    \ and up to date set of references from which to\n   work.  Also, redundancies\
    \ are moved away from the electronic mailing\n   lists so that the lists' subscribers\
    \ do not have to read the same\n   queries and answers over and over again.\n\
    \   Although the questions and their responses are taken from various\n   mailing\
    \ lists, they are presented here loosely grouped by related\n   topic for ease\
    \ of reading.  First the question is presented, then the\n   answer (or answers)\
    \ as it appeared on the mailing list.\n   Sometimes the answers are abridged for\
    \ better use of space.  If a\n   question was not answered on the mailing list,\
    \ the editors provide an\n   answer.  These answers are not distinguished from\
    \ the answers found\n   on the lists.  Sometimes, in order to be as complete as\
    \ possible, the\n   editors provide additional information that was not present\
    \ in the\n   original answer.  If so, that information falls under the heading\n\
    \   \"Additional Information\".\n   The answers are as correct as the reviewers\
    \ can make them.  However,\n   much of this information changes with time.  As\
    \ the FYI is updated,\n   temporal errors will be corrected.\n   Many of the questions\
    \ are in first person, and the answers were\n   directed to the originator of\
    \ the question.  These phrasings have not\n   been changed except where necessary\
    \ for clarity.  References to the\n   correspondents' names have been removed.\n\
    \   The Q/A mailing lists are maintained by Gary Malkin at FTP.COM.  They\n  \
    \ are used by a subgroup of the User Services Working Group to discuss\n   the\
    \ Q/A FYIs.  They include:\n   quail@ftp.com           This is a discussion mailing\
    \ list.  Its\n                           primary use is for pre-release review\
    \ of\n                           the Q/A FYIs.\n   quail-request@ftp.com   This\
    \ is how you join the quail mailing list.\n   quail-box@ftp.com       This is\
    \ where the questions and answers\n                           will be forwarded-and-stored.\
    \  It is\n                           not necessary to be on the quail mailing\n\
    \                           list to forward to the quail-box.\n"

  - "4. Questions About Other Networks and Internets\n   4.1. We have a user who would\
    \ like to access a machine on\n        \"EARN/BITNET\".  I can't find anything\
    \ on this in the domain\n        name tables.  Please, what is this, and how do\
    \ I connect to it?\n      There are several machines on the Internet that act\
    \ as gateways\n      between the Internet and BITNET.  Two examples are UICVM.UIC.EDU\n\
    \      and CUNYVM.CUNY.EDU.  You can address a mail message to\n      user%nodename.bitnet@uicvm.uic.edu\
    \ where the message will be\n      passed from the Internet to BITNET.\n     \
    \ Additional Information:\n         These same gateways, known as INTERBIT on\
    \ the BITNET/EARN side,\n         transfer mail from computers on that network\
    \ which support SMTP\n         mail headers, onto the Internet.  (Many BITNET/EARN\
    \ computers\n         still do not support SMTP, which is not a part of the IBM\n\
    \         protocol used, and it is not possible to send mail from those\n    \
    \     computers across the gateways into the Internet, in general.)\n        \
    \ BITNET and EARN are the two largest of several cooperating\n         networks\
    \ which use the IBM RSCS/NJE protocol suite, but are not\n         limited to\
    \ IBM systems.  These independently administered,\n         interconnected networks\
    \ function as a single, worldwide network\n         directly connecting more than\
    \ 3,300 computers in about 1,400,\n         mostly higher-education, organizations\
    \ worldwide.  This\n         worldwide network supports electronic mail, including\
    \ mailing\n         lists, sender-initiated file transfer, and short \"interactive\"\
    \n         messages.\n         BITNET, frequently used (outside of Europe) to\
    \ refer to the\n         whole worldwide network, technically refers to that portion\
    \ in\n         the United States, plus sites in other countries which are\n  \
    \       connected through the United States and do not have their own\n      \
    \   separately administered cooperating networks.  More than 550\n         organizations\
    \ in the U.S.  participate in BITNET.\n         EARN is the European Academic\
    \ Research Network.  EARN links\n         more than 500 institutions in Europe\
    \ and several surrounding\n         countries.\n         BITNET and CSNET merged\
    \ organizationally on October 1, 1990, to\n         form CREN, the Corporation\
    \ for Research and Educational\n         Networking.  The two networks remain\
    \ separate at the\n         operational level level, however.  (EARN and the other\n\
    \         Cooperating Networks were not involved in this merger.)\n"

  contents:
  - "6. Questions About Domain Name System (DNS)\n   6.1. Is there a DNS Query server?\n\
    \      Actually, what you are looking for is the service that host\n      128.218.1.109\
    \ provides on port 5555 - you simply connect to that\n      host at that port,\
    \ type in a fully qualified domain name and it\n      responds with an internet\
    \ address and closes the connection.  I\n      used it when I had a host that\
    \ still only had /etc/hosts and it\n      did just what I needed - which was basically\
    \ a manual nslookup.\n      However, the vast majority of users will find it simpler\
    \ to just\n      use a DNS query tool and ask the DNS directly.  This doesn't\n\
    \      require much sophistication, and does allow the user to see how\n     \
    \ short names are expanded at the user's site rather than at\n      128.218.1.109\
    \ (wherever that is).  For example, suppose a user\n      wants to find out the\
    \ address of a fully-qualified domain name\n      \"X.MISKATONIC.EDU\", and also\
    \ see what host and address are used\n      when \"Z\" is typed as a host name.\n\
    \      Assuming the user is on a UNIX host and has a copy of the dig\n      program,\
    \ type:\n         dig x.miskatonic.edu\n      and\n         dig z\n         and\
    \ the answers will appear.  You are now on your way to\n         becoming a DNS\
    \ expert.  There are other UNIX alternatives,\n         e.g., nslookup, and similar\
    \ programs for non-UNIX systems.\n         Your local DNS guru certainly has one\
    \ or more of these tools,\n         and although they are often kept from the\
    \ public, they are\n         really quite easy to use for simple cases.\n   6.2.\
    \ We have been having a frequent BIND failure on both our VAX\n        and Solbourne\
    \ that is traced to TCP domain queries from an\n        IBM NSMAIN nameserver\
    \ running in cache mode (UDP queries do\n        not cause this problem, though\
    \ it is usually a UDP\n        resolution that is active upon the crash -- this\
    \ resolution\n        is an innocent victim).\n        I have discovered that\
    \ something is trashing the hash areas\n        (sometimes even as it is being\
    \ recursively used in a\n        resolution).  Also, occasionally the socket/file\
    \ descriptor\n        for the TCP connection is changed to invalid entries causing\n\
    \        a reply write fail (though this is not necessarily fatal,\n        and\
    \ the rest of the structure is not apparently altered).\n        Has any one else\
    \ had frequent BIND failures (especially\n        major domain sites that have\
    \ heavy TCP domain loads)?\n      In both the case of BIND and the IBM implementation,\
    \ often called\n      FAL, there are multiple versions, with older versions being\
    \ truly\n      bad.  Upgrade to recent version before exploring further.\n   \
    \   BIND has always had a problem with polluting its own database.\n      These\
    \ problems have been related to TCP connections, NS RRs with\n      small TTLs,\
    \ and several other causes.  Experience suggests that\n      the style of bug\
    \ fixing has often been that of reducing the\n      problem by 90% rather than\
    \ eliminating it.\n      IBM's support for the DNS (outside of UNIX systems) is\
    \ interesting\n      in its techniques, encouraging in its improvement, but still\n\
    \      somewhat depressing when compared to most other DNS software.  IBM\n  \
    \    also uses terminology that varies somewhat from the usual DNS\n      usage\
    \ and preserves some archaic syntax, e.g., \"..\".\n      The combination of an\
    \ old BIND and an old IBM server is just plain\n      unpleasant.\n   6.3. Is\
    \ the model used by the domain name system for host names\n        that the owner\
    \ of a name gets to choose its case?\n      The model used by the DNS is that\
    \ you get to control at a specific\n      point in the name space, and are hence\
    \ free to select case as you\n      choose, until points where you in turn give\
    \ away control.  As a\n      practical matter, there are several implementations\
    \ that don't do\n      the right thing.  IBM implementations often map everything\
    \ into a\n      single case.\n   6.4. According to RFC 1034 [2], section 4.2.1,\
    \ one should not have\n        to code glue RR's for name server's names unless\
    \ they are below\n        the cut.  When I don't put glue RR's in, and do a query\
    \ for\n        NS records, the \"additional\" field is left blank.  As far as\
    \ I\n        can tell, all other zones I query for NS records have this\n    \
    \    filled with the IP addresses of the NS hosts.  Is this required\n       \
    \ or should I not be concerned that the additional field is empty?\n      The\
    \ protocol says that an empty additional field is not a problem\n      when the\
    \ name server's name is not \"below\" the cut.\n      In practice, putting in\
    \ the glue where it is not required can\n      cause problems if the servers named\
    \ in the glue are used for\n      several zones.  This is broken behavior in BIND.\
    \  Not putting in\n      glue can cause other problems in BIND, usually when the\
    \ server\n      name is difficult to resolve.  So, the bottom line is to put glue\n\
    \      in only when required, and don't use aliases or anything else\n      tricky\
    \ when it comes to identifying name servers.\n"

  - "7. Questions About Network Management Implementations\n   7.1. In reading the\
    \ SNMP RFCs [3,4,5,6] I find mention of\n        authentication of PDUs.  Are\
    \ there any standards for\n        authentication mechanisms?\n      There is\
    \ a working group of the IETF that is working on this\n      problem.  They are\
    \ close to a solution, but nothing has yet\n      reached RFC publication yet.\
    \  Expect something solid and\n      implementable by October of 1991.\n   7.2.\
    \ Can vendors make their enterprise-specific variables available\n        to users\
    \ through a standard distribution mechanism?\n      Yes.  But before someone submits\
    \ a MIB, they should check it out\n      themselves.\n      On uu.psi.com in pilot/snmp-wg/,\
    \ there are two files\n              mosy-sparc-4.0.3.c\n              mosy-sun3-3.5\n\
    \      The first will run on a Sun-Sparc, the second will run on a Sun-3.\n  \
    \    After retrieving one of these files in BINARY mode via anonymous FTP,\n \
    \     the submittor can run their MIB through it, e.g.,\n              % mosy\
    \ mymib.my\n      Once your MIB passes, send it to:\n              mib-checker@isi.edu\n\
    \      If everything is OK, the mib-checker will arrange to have it\n      installed\
    \ in the /share/ftp/mib directory on venera.isi.edu.\n      Note: This processing\
    \ does not offer an official endorsement.  The\n      documents submitted must\
    \ not be marked proprietary, confidential,\n      or the like.\n   7.3. I have\
    \ a question regarding those pesky octet strings again.\n        I use the variable-type\
    \ field of the Response pdu to determine\n        how the result should be displayed\
    \ to the user.  For example,\n        I convert NetworkAddresses to their dotted\
    \ decimal format\n        (\"132.243.50.4\").  I convert Object Identifiers into\
    \ strings\n        (\"1.3.6.1.2....\").\n        I would LIKE to just print Octet\
    \ Strings as strings.  But,\n        this causes a problem in such cases as atPhysAddress\
    \ in\n        which the Octet string contains the 6 byte address instead\n   \
    \     of a printable ASCII string.  In this case, I would want to\n        display\
    \ the 6 bytes instead of just trying to print the\n        string.\n        MY\
    \ QUESTION IS: Does anyone have a suggestion as to how I\n        can determine\
    \ whether I can just print the string or whether\n        I should display the\
    \ octet bytes.  * Remember: I want to\n        support enterprise specific variables\
    \ too.\n      In general, there is no way that you can tell what is inside an\n\
    \      OCTET STRING without knowing something about the object that the\n    \
    \  OCTET STRING comes from.  In MIB-II [6], some objects are marked\n      as\
    \ DisplayString which has the syntax of OCTET STRING but is\n      restricted\
    \ to characters from the NVT ASCII character set (see the\n      TELNET Specification,\
    \ RFC 854 [7], for further information).\n      These objects are:\n         sysDescr\n\
    \         sysContact\n         sysName\n         sysLocation\n         ifDescr\n\
    \      If you want to be able to arbitrarily decide how to display the\n     \
    \ strings, without knowing anything about the object, then you can\n      scan\
    \ the octets, looking for any octet which is not printable\n      ASCII.  If you\
    \ find at least one, you can print the entire string,\n      octet by octet, in\
    \ \"%02x:\" notation.  If all of the octets are\n      printable ASCII, then you\
    \ can just printf the string.\n   7.4. If archived MIBs must be 1155-compatible\
    \ [3], it would be nice\n        if those who submit them check them first.  Where\
    \ are these\n        MIB tools available for public FTP?  Ideally, a simple\n\
    \        syntax checker (that didn't actually generate code) would be\n      \
    \  nice.\n      In the ISODE 6.0 release there is a tool called MOSY which\n \
    \     recognizes the 1155 syntax and produces a flat ASCII file.  If you\n   \
    \   can run it through MOSY without problems then you are OK.\n   7.5. Suppose\
    \ I want to create a private MIB object for causing\n        some action to happen,\
    \ say, do a reset.  Should the syntax\n        or this object specify a value\
    \ such as:\n         Syntax:\n            INTEGER {\n               perform reset\
    \ (1),\n            }\n        even though there is only a single value?  Or,\
    \ is it ok to\n        just allow a Set on this object with any value to perform\n\
    \        the desired action?  If the later, how is this specified?\n      For\
    \ our SNMP manageable gizmos and doohickies with similar\n      \"action\" type\
    \ MIB variables, I've defined two values\n            Syntax:\n              \
    \ INTEGER {\n                  reset(1)\n                  not-reset(2)\n    \
    \           }\n      And defined behavior so that the only valid value that the\n\
    \      variable may be set to is \"reset\" (which is returned in the get\n   \
    \   response PDU) and at all other times a get/getnext will respond\n      with\
    \ \"not-reset\".\n"

    \ lines and the upper level protocols on the\n         OSI Model.  The only requirement\

    \ director of network systems for\n         Telebit, PPP is a direct improvement\
    \ upon Serial Line Internet\n         Protocol (SLIP), which had neither error\
    \ correction nor a way\n         to exchange network address.\"\n   8.3. Does\
    \ anyone know if there is a way to run a SLIP program on\n        a IBM computer\
    \ running SCO Xenix/Unix, with a multi-port\n        serial board?\n      SCO\
    \ TCP/IP for Xenix supports SLIP.  It works.  However, be\n      warned: SCO SLIP\
    \ works *only* with SCO serial drivers, so it will\n      *not* work with intelligent\
    \ boards that come with their own\n      drivers.  If you want lots of SLIP ports,\
    \ you'll need lots of dumb\n      ports, perhaps with a multi-dumb-port board.\n\
    \      Here's the setup -- SunOS 3.5, with the 4.3BSD TCP, IP & SLIP\n      distributions\
    \ installed.  Slip is running between the \"ttya\" ports\n      of two Sun 3/60's.\
    \  \"ping\", \"rlogin\", etc., works fine, but a NFS\n      mount results in \"\
    server not responding: RPC Timed Out\".\n      SunOS 3.5 turns the UDP checksum\
    \ off, which is legal and works\n      okay over interfaces such as ethernet which\
    \ has link- level\n      checksumming.  On the other hand, SLIP doesn't perform\
    \ checksums\n      thus running NFS over SLIP requires you to turn the UDP checksum\n\
    \      on.  Otherwise, you'll experience erratic behavior such as the one\n  \
    \    described above.\n         Save the older kernel and try,\n            %\
    \ adb -k -w /vmunix /dev/kmem udpcksum?w 1\n         to patch up the kernel.\n"

    \ recognize ethernet type \"80F3\"?  I don't see it\n         in RFC 1010, but\
    \ I am seeing it on our net.\n      Ethernet type 0x80F3 is used by AppleTalk\
    \ for address resolution.\n      You must have Macs on your network which are\
    \ directly connected to\n      Ethernet.  These packets are used by the Mac (generally\
    \ at\n      startup) to determine a valid AppleTalk node number.\n      Additional\
    \ Information:\n      RFC 1010 is obsolete.  Please consult RFC 1060 [11], the\
    \ current\n      \"Assigned Numbers\" (issued March 1990), which does list \"\

    \ of a high value for\n         \"Bad proto\" in the output from netstat on Unix\
    \ machines using\n         ethernet?  We're seeing values in the tens of thousands\
    \ out of\n         a few hundred thousand packets sent/received in all.  Some\n\
    \         \"Bad proto\" values are negative, too.  (Off the scale?)  Any\n   \
    \      help would be appreciated.\n      This probably indicates that you are\
    \ getting tens of thousands of\n      broadcast packets from some host or hosts\
    \ on your network.  You\n      might want to buy or rent a LAN monitor, or install\
    \ one of the\n      public-domain packages to see what private protocol is guilty.\n\

    \ the problem.\n   10.3. Which RFC would explain the proper way to configure broadcast\n\
    \         addresses when using subnets?\n      Consult RFC 1122, \"Requirements\
    \ for Internet Hosts --\n      Communication Layer\" [13].\n   10.4. Can anyone\
    \ tell me what .TAR files exactly are?  Is it like\n         ZIP or LZH for the\
    \ IBM PC's?  IF so, how do I go about getting\n         a compressor/decompressor\
    \ for .TAR files and what computer\n         does this run on?\n      TAR stands\
    \ for \"Tape ARchive\".  It is a Unix utility which takes\n      files, and directories\
    \ of files, and creates a single large file.\n      Originally intended to back\
    \ up directory trees onto tape (hence\n      the name), TAR is also used to combine\
    \ files for easier electronic\n      file transfer.\n"
