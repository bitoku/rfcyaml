Abstract This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB) for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
The document proposes an extension to the Remote Monitoring MIB, RFC 2819.
In particular, it describes managed objects used for real time application Quality of Service (QoS) monitoring.
This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB) for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
In particular, it extends [RFC2819] with managed objects used for real time application QoS monitoring.
The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].
The Internet Standard Management Framework
For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current Internet Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of RFC 3410 [RFC3410].
Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed the Management Information Base or MIB.
MIB objects are generally accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the Structure of Management Information (SMI).
This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58, RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58
, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
As outlined in [RFC4710], the RAQMON framework is based on three entities: RAQMON Data Source (RDS) RAQMON Report Collector (RRC)
The RAQMON MIB describes information passed between RRCs and a RAQMON Application ("RAQMON manager").
The RAQMON MIB module is composed of three MIB groups: raqmonSession, raqmonException, and raqmonConfig.
The raqmonSession MIB group incorporates the following tables: The raqmonParticpantTable contains information about participants in open and closed (terminated) sessions, including parameters of the sessions they are involved in, aggregated since the beginning of the session.
The raqmonQosTable contains historical information about QoS during sessions.
The set of parameters represented in this table is more restricted, but it includes historical per  RAQMON report information.
The raqmonParticpantAddrTable maps participant addresses into the indices of the raqmonParticpantTable.
This table allows management applications to find entries sorted by raqmonParticipantAddr rather than raqmonParticipantStartDate.
The raqmonException MIB group includes a table of filters that trigger notifications for sessions with poor QoS.
The raqmonConfig MIB group includes objects that define the configuration of the RAQMON Report Collector.
This MIB module MUST be implemented by RAQMON Report Collectors.
A separate MIB module is defined in [RFC4712] for mapping the RAQMON PDUs onto an SNMP transport.
The MIB module defined in [RFC4712] is normally implemented by RAQMON Data Sources (RDS).
The MIB module herein IMPORTS definitions from the following: SNMPv2
It also uses REFERENCE clauses to refer to [RFC4710].
It also mentions [RFC3737] with respect to the MODULE IDENTITY OID allocation.

There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB module with a MAX ACCESS clause of read write.
Such objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.
The support for SET operations in a non secure environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on network operations.
Setting the value of the object raqmonRDSTimeout to too low a value would result in RDS sessions being terminated sooner than necessary, while setting at too high a value may result in terminated sessions continuing to be managed, with unnecessary memory allocations.
Setting the following object to incorrect values can result in the collectors either flooding the management applications with unnecessary notifications, or not sending notifications when the QoS in the network may be degraded.
Setting the raqmonConfigPort object to incorrect values can result in the collector not being able to receive RAQMON PDUs from the data sources.
Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a MAX ACCESS other than not accessible) may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.
These are: raqmonParticipantTable raqmonQoSTable raqmonParticpantAddrTable Unauthorized exposure of these objects may lead to disclosure of the addresses of the participants in applications, or information about the traffic patents of the applications, which may be considered sensitive in certain environments.
It is thus important to control even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly to even encrypt their values when sending them over the network via SNMP.
The structure of the RAQMON tables limits what can be usefully done for access control configuration using View based Access Control Model (VACM).
For example, with these structures it would not be possible to provide a group, with access to performance data for a specific group of devices, since the index values for raqmonParticpantEntry cannot be known in advance.
Likewise, raqmonSessionExceptionEntries apply to all entries in the raqmonQoSTable.
SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPsec), even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is allowed to access and
the objects in this MIB module.
It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8), including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for authentication and privacy).
Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT RECOMMENDED.
Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to enable cryptographic security.
It is then a customer/operator responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate rights to indeed GET or SET
No requirements from IANA are defined in this document.
The root OID of the MIB module defined in this document belongs to the RMON subtree, as reserved in [RFC3737].
