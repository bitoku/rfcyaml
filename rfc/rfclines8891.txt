In addition to a new cipher with a block length of n 128 bits (referred to as "Kuznyechik" and described in RFC 7801), Russian Federal standard GOST R 34.12 2015 includes an updated version of the block cipher with a block length of n 64 bits and key length of k 256 bits, which is also referred to as "Magma".
The algorithm is an updated version of an older block cipher with a block length of n 64 bits described in GOST 28147 89 (RFC 5830).
This document is intended to be a source of information about the updated version of the 64 bit cipher.
It may facilitate the use of the block cipher in Internet applications by providing information for developers and users of the GOST 64 bit cipher with the revised version of the cipher for encryption and decryption.
The Russian Federal standard [GOSTR3412 2015] specifies basic block ciphers used as cryptographic techniques for information processing and information protection, including the provision of confidentiality, authenticity, and integrity of information during information transmission, processing, and storage in computer aided systems.
The cryptographic algorithms defined in this specification are designed both for hardware and software implementation.
They comply with modern cryptographic requirements and put no restrictions on the confidentiality level of the protected information.
This document is intended to be a source of information about the updated version of the 64 bit cipher.
It may facilitate the use of the block cipher in Internet applications by providing information for developers and users of a GOST 64 bit cipher with the revised version of the cipher for encryption and decryption.
The Russian Federal standard [GOSTR3412 2015] was developed by the Center for Information Protection and Special Communications of the Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation, with participation of the open joint stock company "Information Technologies and Communication Systems" (InfoTeCS JSC).
GOST R 34.12 2015 was approved and introduced by Decree #749 of the Federal Agency on Technical Regulating and Metrology on June 19, 2015.
The following terms and their corresponding definitions are used in the specification.
process that transforms plaintext into ciphertext
(Clause 2.19 of [ISO IEC18033 1])
process that transforms ciphertext into plaintext
(Clause 2.14 of [ISO IEC18033 1])
basic block cipher:  block cipher that, for a given key, provides a single invertible mapping of the set of fixed length plaintext blocks into ciphertext blocks of the same length block:  string of bits of a defined length (Clause 2.6 of [ISO IEC18033 1])
block cipher:  symmetric encipherment system with the property that the encryption algorithm operates on a block of plaintext   i.e., a string of bits of a defined length   to yield a block of ciphertext

In GOST R 34.12 2015, it is established that the terms "block cipher" and "block encryption algorithm" are synonyms.

key:  sequence of symbols that controls the operation of a cryptographic transformation (e.g., encipherment, decipherment)
(Clause 2.21 of [ISO IEC18033 1])
Note: In GOST R 34.12 2015, the key must be a binary sequence.
unencrypted information (Clause 3.11 of [ISO IEC10116])
key schedule:  calculation of round keys from the key
, decryption:  reversal of a corresponding encipherment (Clause 2.13 of [ISO IEC18033 1])

cipher:  alternative term for encipherment system
(Clause 2.20 of [ISO IEC18033 1]) ciphertext:  data that has been transformed to hide its information content (Clause 3.3 of [ISO IEC10116]) 3.2.

Unlike [RFC5830] (GOST 28147 89), but like [RFC7801], this specification does not define exact block modes that should be used together with the updated Magma cipher.
One is free to select block modes depending on the protocol and necessity.
This section is for information only and is not a normative part of the specification.

This specification is a translation of relevant parts of the [GOSTR3412 2015] standard.
The order of terms in both parts of Section 3 comes from the original text.
Combining [RFC7801] with this document will create a complete translation of [GOSTR3412 2015] into English.
Algorithmically, Magma is a variation of the block cipher defined in [RFC5830] ([GOST28147 89]) with the following clarifications and minor modifications: 1.
S BOX set is fixed at id tc26 gost 28147 param Z (see Appendix C of [RFC7836]);
key is parsed as a single big endian integer (compared to the little endian approach used in [GOST28147 89]), which results in different subkey values being used; 3.  data bytes are also parsed as a single big endian integer (instead of being parsed as little endian integer).
