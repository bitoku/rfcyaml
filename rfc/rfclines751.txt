SURVEY OF FTP MAIL AND MLFL Two surveys of Arpanet Server hosts were run between September 20, 1978 and December 11, 1978.
The intent was to determine the response of the host's Server FTP program to: (a)
An attempt to mail to an unknown recipient at that host.
The purpose of this survey was two fold.
First, to determine whether the host accepts mail for unknown recipients at all, and second, what response the host gives if it does not accept such mail.
An attempt to mail to a known recipient using the MLFL command rather than the usual MAIL command.
This survey was undertaken to determine the extent of support for the MLFL command among Server hosts, and the sort of reply received if the Server does not support MLFL.
MLFL is potentially a 'better' form of communication than mail as the message is sent over a data connection rather than the command connection.
Using the data connection eliminates the 'end of mail' marker and 'command reader' problems sometimes encountered over the command connection.
The ground rules of the survey were that all sites listed as Servers in the MIT/SAIL Host table were surveyed.
In many cases, a host listed as a Server would not respond to an ICP at any time during the period of the survey.
Once a host responded with what seemed to me to be a 'definitive' answer, I marked it as such and stopped surveying it.
The algorithm used was to ICP to socket 3 of the server (the standard old FTP socket).
Once a 300 response was received, I sent the MLFL command.
Where I had the name of a real mailbox at a site (a Header person, for example)
If a site asked for a password (response 504) after the MLFL command I gave "USER NETML" "PASS NETML" and retried the MLFL.
If the server replied with a 255 SOCK command, I listened for the data connection to be established.
When it was, I transferred the mail file.
Interestingly enough, most sites implement an RFC queueing algorithm that will allow the user site to attempt to establish the data connection from its end.
Sites are grouped by the general result they gave.
Sites that don't support MLFL and say so:
that support MLFL (or at least go through all the right motions):
Sites that support MLFL but require "USER NETML" "PASS NETML" (Multics): MIT MULTICS RADC MULTICS 5)
Others: a) Sites that might support it if I could mail to a real user (some of these run operating systems that are "known to work", e.g. TENEX):
No such mailbox at this site.
No such mailbox at this site.
b) Sites that either never responded to an ICP to socket 3, or were not accepting FTP users:
The mechanics of the MAIL survey were similar to those of the MLFL survey.
The command was "MAIL Fzorkness" (an account unlikely to exist on any host).
The responses are grouped into a few general categories.

1) Sites that lost completely.
2) Sites that accept mail to an unknown recipient.
Sites that refuse mail to an unknown recipient (grouped by response).
