  - "1.  Introduction\n   The SIP Geolocation specification [RFC6442] describes the\n
    \  \"Geolocation\" SIP header field, which is used to indicate that the\n   SIP
    message is conveying location information.  [RFC6442] specifies\n   that SIP intermediaries
    should not add locationValues to a SIP\n   request that already contains a locationValue.
    \ [RFC6442] also states\n   that if a SIP intermediary adds location, it is fully
    responsible for\n   addressing the concerns of any 424 (Bad Location Information)
    SIP\n   response it receives.  However, some communications architectures,\n   such
    as 3GPP [TS23-167] and ETSI [M493], prefer to use information\n   provided by
    edge proxies or acquired through the use of core-network\n   nodes before using
    information provided solely by user equipment\n   (UE).  These solutions don't
    preclude the use of UE-provided location\n   but require a means of being able
    to distinguish the identity of the\n   node adding the locationValue to the SIP
    message from that provided\n   by the UE.\n   [RFC6442] stipulates that the order
    of locationValues in the\n   Geolocation header field is the same as the order
    in which they were\n   added to the header field.  Whilst this order provides
    guidance to\n   the recipient as to which values were added to the message earlier
    in\n   the communication chain, it does not identify which node added the\n   locationValue.
    \ Knowing the identity of the entity that added the\n   location to the message
    allows the recipient to choose which location\n   to consider first rather than
    relying solely on the order of the\n   locationValues in the Geolocation header
    field.\n   This document extends the Geolocation header field of [RFC6442] by\n
    \  allowing an entity adding the locationValue to identify itself using\n   a
    hostname.  This is done by defining a new geoloc-param header field\n   parameter,
    \"loc-src\".  How the entity adding the locationValue to the\n   header field
    obtains the location information is out of scope of this\n   document.  Please
    note that the \"loc-src\" parameter field does not\n   alter the subject of the
    locationValue.\n"

    as shown here.\n"
  title: 2.  Terminology
- contents:
  - "3.  Rationale\n   The primary intent of the \"loc-src\" parameter in this specification\n
    \  is for use in emergency calling.  There are various architectures\n   defined
    for providing emergency calling using SIP-based messaging.\n   Each has its own
    characteristics with corresponding pros and cons.\n   All of them allow the UE
    to provide location information; however,\n   many also attach other sources of
    location information to support\n   veracity checks, to provide backup information,
    or to be used as the\n   primary location.\n   This document does not comment
    on these various architectures or on\n   the rationale for including multiple
    locationValues.  It does\n   recognize that these architectures exist and that
    there is a need to\n   identify the entity adding the location information.\n
    \  The \"loc-src\" parameter adds the location source generating the\n   locationValue
    to allow recipients to make informed decisions about\n   which of the multiple
    values to use.\n   The \"loc-src\" parameter is applicable within a single private\n
    \  administrative domain or between different administrative domains\n   where
    there is a trust relationship between the domains.  Thus, it is\n   intended to
    use this parameter only in trust domains where Spec(T) as\n   described in [RFC3325]
    exists.\n   The \"loc-src\" parameter is not included in a SIP message sent to\n
    \  another network if there is no trust relationship.  The \"loc-src\"\n   parameter
    is not applicable if the administrative domain manages\n   emergency calls in
    a way that does not require any generation of the\n   location.\n   The functional
    architecture to support emergency caller location\n   described within ETSI [M493]
    is an example of an architecture where\n   it makes sense to use this parameter.\n"
  title: 3.  Rationale
- contents:
  - "4.  Mechanism\n   The mechanism adds a geoloc-param parameter to the locationValue\n
    \  defined in [RFC6442] that identifies the hostname of the entity\n   adding
    the locationValue to the Geolocation header field.  The\n   Augmented BNF (ABNF)
    [RFC5234] for this parameter is shown in\n   Figure 1.\n          location-source
    = \"loc-src\" EQUAL hostname\n          hostname = <defined in RFC 3261>\n                         Figure
    1: Location Source\n   Only a fully qualified host name is valid.  The syntax
    does not\n   support IP addresses, and if an entity conforming to this\n   specification
    receives a Geolocation header field with a \"loc-src\"\n   parameter containing
    an IP address, it MUST remove the parameter.\n   A SIP intermediary conformant
    to this specification adding a\n   locationValue to a Geolocation header field
    SHOULD also add a \"loc-\n   src\" header field parameter so that it is clearly
    identified as the\n   node adding the location.  A User Agent (UA) MUST NOT insert
    a \"loc-\n   src\" header field parameter.  If a SIP intermediary receives a\n
    \  message from an untrusted source with the \"loc-src\" parameter set,\n   then
    it MUST remove the \"loc-src\" parameter before passing the\n   message into a
    trusted network.\n"
  title: 4.  Mechanism
- contents:
  - "5.  Example\n   The following example shows a SIP INVITE message containing a\n
    \  Geolocation header field with two locationValues.  The first\n   locationValue
    points to a Presence Information Data Format Location\n   Object (PIDF-LO) in
    the SIP body using a content-indirection (cid:)\n   URI per [RFC4483], and this
    is provided by the UE.  The second\n   locationValue is an https URI provided
    by a SIP intermediary, which\n   identifies itself using the \"loc-src\" parameter.\n

  title: 5.  Example
- contents:
  - "6.  Privacy Considerations\n   This document doesn't change any of the privacy
    considerations\n   described in [RFC6442].  While the addition of the \"loc-src\"\n
    \  parameter identifies the entity that added the location in the\n   signaling
    path, this addition provides little more exposure than\n   adding a proxy identity
    to the Record-Route header field (privacy\n   defined in [RFC3323]).\n"
  title: 6.  Privacy Considerations
- contents:
  - "7.  Security Considerations\n   This document introduces the ability of a SIP
    intermediary to insert\n   a host name indicating that they added the specific
    locationValue to\n   the Geolocation header field.  The intent is for this field
    to be\n   used by the location recipient in the event that the SIP message\n   contains
    multiple locationValues.  As a consequence, this parameter\n   should only be
    used by the location recipient in a trusted network.\n   Adding this parameter
    in an untrusted network serves solely to give\n   location information to untrusted
    parties and is NOT RECOMMENDED.\n   As already stated in [RFC6442], securing the
    location hop by hop,\n   using TLS, protects the message from eavesdropping and
    modification\n   in transit but exposes the information to all SIP intermediaries
    on\n   the path as well as the endpoint.  The \"loc-src\" parameter is\n   applicable
    within a single private administrative domain or between\n   different administrative
    domains where there is a relationship\n   between the domains.  If such a trust
    relationship is not given, it\n   is strongly recommended to delete the location
    information.\n   The use of this parameter is not restricted to a specific\n   architecture,
    but using multiple locations and loc-src may end in\n   compatibility issues.
    \ [RFC6442] already addresses the issue of\n   multiple locations.  To avoid problems
    of a possible corruption of\n   the location information including the \"loc-src\"
    parameter when using\n   an untrusted relationship, it is strongly recommended
    to delete\n   location information when passed to another domain out of the trust\n
    \  domain.\n"
