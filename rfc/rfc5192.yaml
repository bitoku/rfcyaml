  - "Abstract\n   This document defines new DHCPv4 and DHCPv6 options that contain
    a\n   list of IP addresses to locate one or more PANA (Protocol for\n   carrying

  - "1.  Introduction\n   The Protocol for carrying Authentication for Network Access
    (PANA)\n   [RFC5191] defines a new Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP)\n
    \  [RFC3748] lower layer that uses IP between the protocol end-points.\n   The
    PANA protocol is run between a PANA Client (PaC) and a PANA\n   Authentication
    Agent (PAA) in order to perform authentication and\n   authorization for the network
    access service.\n   This document specifies DHCPv4 [RFC2131] and DHCPv6 [RFC3315]
    options\n   that allow PANA clients (PaCs) to discover PANA Authentication Agents\n
    \  (PAAs).  This is one of the methods for locating PAAs.\n   The DHCP options
    defined in this document are used only as a PAA\n   discovery mechanism.  These
    DHCP options MUST NOT be used to perform\n   any negotiation of the use of PANA
    between the PaC and a PAA.\n"

    to signify the requirements\n   of the specification.  These words are often capitalized.
    \ The key\n   words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",
    \"SHOULD\",\n   \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in
    this document\n   are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].\n"

  - "3.  Terminology\n   This document uses the DHCP terminology defined in [RFC2131],\n
    \  [RFC2132], and [RFC3315].\n   This document uses the PANA terminology defined
    in [RFC5191].  In\n   particular, the following terms are defined:\n      PANA
    Client (PaC):\n         The client side of the protocol that resides in the access\n
    \        device (e.g., laptop, PDA, etc.).  It is responsible for\n         providing
    the credentials in order to prove its identity\n         (authentication) for
    network access authorization.  The PaC and\n         the EAP peer are co-located
    in the same access device.\n      PANA Authentication Agent (PAA):\n         The
    protocol entity in the access network whose responsibility\n         it is to
    verify the credentials provided by a PANA client (PaC)\n         and authorize
    network access to the access device.  The PAA and\n         the EAP authenticator
    (and optionally the EAP server) are\n         colocated in the same node.\n"

  title: 6.  IANA Considerations
- contents:
  - "7.  Security Considerations\n   The security considerations in [RFC2131], [RFC2132],
    and [RFC3315]\n   apply.  If an adversary manages to modify the response from
    a DHCP\n   server or insert its own response, a PANA Client could be led to\n
    \  contact a rogue PANA Authentication Agent, possibly one that then\n   intercepts
    authentication requests and/or denies network access to\n   the access device.\n
    \  In most networks, the DHCP exchange that delivers the options prior\n   to
    network access authentication is neither integrity protected nor\n   origin authenticated.
    \ Therefore, the options defined in this\n   document MUST NOT be used to perform
    any negotiation on the use of\n   PANA between the PANA Client and a PANA Authentication
    Agent.  Using\n   the presence (or absence) of these DHCP options as an indication
    of\n   network mandating PANA authentication (or not) is an example of such\n
    \  a negotiation mechanism.  This negotiation would allow bidding-down\n   attacks
    by making the clients choose to use a lower-grade security\n   mechanism (or even
    no security at all).\n"
