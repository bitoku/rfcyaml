- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   [DKIM] defines a mechanism for transparent domain-level\
    \ signing of\n   messages for the purpose of declaring that a particular\n   ADministrative\
    \ Management Domain (ADMD) takes some responsibility for\n   a message.\n   DKIM,\
    \ however, deliberately makes no binding between the DNS domain\n   of the Signer\
    \ and any other identity found in the message.  Despite\n   this, there is an\
    \ automatic human perception that an Author Domain\n   Signature (one for which\
    \ the RFC5322.From domain matches the DNS\n   domain of the Signer) is more valuable\
    \ or trustworthy than any other.\n   To enable a third party to apply DKIM signatures\
    \ to messages, the\n   DKIM specification suggests delegation to a third party\
    \ of either\n   subdomains or private keys, so that the third party can add DKIM\n\
    \   signatures that appear to have been added by the Author ADMD.  Absent\n  \
    \ is a protocol by which an Author ADMD can announce that messages\n   bearing\
    \ specific valid DKIM signatures on its mail, which are added\n   by other ADMDs,\
    \ are to be treated as if they were signed by the\n   Author ADMD itself.  This\
    \ memo presents an experimental mechanism for\n   doing so, called Authorized\
    \ Third-Party Signatures (ATPS).\n   ATPS augments the semantics of DKIM by providing\
    \ to the Verifier\n   multiple identifiers rather than one.  Specifically, it\
    \ validates the\n   identifier found in the DKIM signature, and then provides\
    \ the\n   RFC5322.From domain for evaluation.\n   This memo also registers, per\
    \ [AUTHRES], the means to indicate to\n   agents downstream of the Verifier that\
    \ a third-party signature\n   verification occurred.\n"

- title: 3.  Roles and Scope
  contents:
  - "3.  Roles and Scope\n   The context of this protocol involves the following roles:\n\
    \   o  ADministrative Management Domains (ADMDs), whose DNS domain\n      name(s)\
    \ appear in the RFC5322.From field of a [MAIL] message;\n   o  ATPS Signers, which\
    \ apply [DKIM] signatures using their own\n      domains, but on behalf of the\
    \ message Author's ADMD; and\n   o  the Verifier, who implements the signature\
    \ validation procedures\n      described in [DKIM].\n   An ADMD implements this\
    \ protocol if it wishes to announce that a\n   signature from any in a set of\
    \ specified DNS domains is to be\n   considered equivalent to one from the ADMD\
    \ itself.  For example, an\n   ADMD might wish to delegate signing authority for\
    \ its DNS domain to\n   an approved messaging service provider without doing the\
    \ work of key\n   transfer described in Appendix B.1.1 of [DKIM].  An authorized\
    \ ATPS\n   Signer makes a claim of this relationship via new tags in the DKIM\n\
    \   signature, and the ADMD confirms this claim by publishing a specific\n   TXT\
    \ record in its DNS.\n   A Verifier implements this protocol if it wishes to ensure\
    \ that a\n   message bears one or more signatures from sources authorized to sign\n\
    \   mail on behalf of the ADMD, and identify for special treatment mail\n   that\
    \ meets (or does not meet) that criterion.  It will do so by\n   treating the\
    \ Signer's authorization on behalf of the Author's ADMD to\n   mean that the Signer's\
    \ signature is equivalent to one affixed by the\n   Author's ADMD.\n"

  - "4.  Queries and Replies\n   This section describes in detail the queries issued,\
    \ the replies\n   received, and how they should be interpreted and applied.\n"
- title: 4.1.  Hash Selection
  contents:
  - "4.1.  Hash Selection\n   The Author's ADMD will indicate authorization of a third\
    \ party to\n   sign its mail via the presence of a DNS TXT record that contains\
    \ an\n   encoding of the third party's DNS domain name.  There are two\n   supported\
    \ methods for doing so -- one that involves a plain copy of\n   the third party's\
    \ DNS domain name, and one that involves an encoded\n   version of the name. \
    \ The encoding mechanism is provided so that any\n   domain name can be added\
    \ to the DNS in a fixed length, so that longer\n   third-party domain names are\
    \ not excluded from participation because\n   of the overall length limit on a\
    \ DNS query.\n   If selected, the encoding mechanism requires constructing a digest\
    \ of\n   the third party's DNS domain name.  The Author ADMD MUST select a\n \
    \  digest (\"hash\") method currently supported by DKIM (see Section 7.7\n   of\
    \ [DKIM]), and this selection needs to be communicated to the ATPS\n   Signer,\
    \ as it is used in generation of the third-party signatures.\n   Where the encoding\
    \ mechanism is not used, the ATPS Signer MUST use a\n   hash name of \"none\"\
    .\n   The full DNS mechanism is specified in Section 4.3.\n"
- title: 4.2.  Extension to DKIM
  contents:
  - "4.2.  Extension to DKIM\n   [DKIM] signatures contain a \"tag=value\" sequence.\
    \  This protocol will\n   add additional tags called \"atps\" and \"atpsh\".\n\
    \   When the ATPS Signer generates a DKIM signature for another ADMD, it\n   MUST\
    \ put its own domain in the signature's \"d\" tag, and include an\n   \"atps\"\
    \ tag that has as its value the domain name of the ADMD on whose\n   behalf it\
    \ is signing.\n   The tag name that carries the name of the selected hash algorithm\
    \ is\n   \"atpsh\".  This tag MUST also be included, as it is required as part\n\
    \   of the algorithm that will be enacted by the Verifier.\n   The formal syntax\
    \ definition, per [ABNF], is as follows:\n      dkim-atps-tag = %x61.74.70.73\
    \ *WSP \"=\" *WSP domain-name\n      dkim-atpsh-tag = %x61.74.70.73.68 *WSP \"\
    =\" *WSP\n                       ( \"none\" / key-h-tag-alg )\n   \"domain-name\"\
    \ and \"key-h-tag-alg\" are defined in [DKIM].  Note that\n   according to [DKIM],\
    \ internationalized domain names are to be encoded\n   as A-labels, as described\
    \ in Section 2.3 of [IDNA].\n   The registration for these tags can be found in\
    \ Section 8.\n"
- title: 4.3.  ATPS Query Details
  contents:
  - "4.3.  ATPS Query Details\n   When a [DKIM] signature including an \"atps\" tag\
    \ is successfully\n   verified, and is considered acceptable to the Verifier according\
    \ to\n   any local policy requirements (which are not discussed here or in\n \
    \  [DKIM]), the Verifier compares the domain name in the value of that\n   tag\
    \ with the one found in the RFC5322.From field of the message.  The\n   match\
    \ MUST be done in a case-insensitive manner.\n   If they do not match, the \"\
    atps\" tag MUST be ignored.\n   If they do match, the Verifier issues a DNS TXT\
    \ query, as specified\n   below, looking for confirmation by the Author ADMD that\
    \ the ATPS\n   Signer is authorized by that ADMD to sign mail on its behalf. \
    \ Where\n   multiple DKIM signatures including valid \"atps\" tags are present,\n\
    \   these queries MAY be done in any order or MAY be done in parallel.\n   Where\
    \ the RFC5322.From field contains multiple addresses, this\n   process SHOULD\
    \ be applied if the \"atps\" tag's value matches any of\n   the domains found\
    \ in that field.  These MAY be done in any order.\n   Note that the algorithm\
    \ uses hashing, but this is not a security\n   mechanism.  See Section 9.2 for\
    \ discussion.\n   The name for the query is constructed as follows:\n   1.  Select\
    \ the hash algorithm from the \"atpsh\" tag in the signature.\n       If the hash\
    \ algorithm specified does not appear in the list\n       registered with IANA\
    \ as one valid for use with DKIM (see\n       Section 7.7 of [DKIM]), and is not\
    \ the reserved name \"none\" as\n       described above, abort the query.\n  \
    \ 2.  Extract the value of the \"d=\" tag from the signature.\n   3.  Convert\
    \ any uppercase characters in that string to their\n       lowercase equivalents.\n\
    \   4.  If the selected hash algorithm is not \"none\", apply the following\n\
    \       additional steps:\n       A.  Feed the resulting string to the selected\
    \ hash algorithm.\n       B.  Convert the output of the hash to a string of printable\
    \ ASCII\n           characters by applying base32 encoding as defined in\n   \
    \        Section 6 of [BASE32].  The base32 encoding is used because\n       \
    \    its output is restricted to characters that are legal for use\n         \
    \  in labels in the DNS, and it is evaluated the same way in the\n           DNS\
    \ whether encoded using uppercase or lowercase characters.\n   5.  Append the\
    \ string \"._atps.\"\n   6.  Append the domain name found in the \"atps\" tag\
    \ of the validated\n       signature.\n   The query's formal syntax definition,\
    \ per [ABNF], is as follows:\n      atps-query = ( 1*63BASE32 / domain-name )\n\
    \                   %x2e.5f.61.74.70.73.2e domain-name\n      BASE32 = ( ALPHA\
    \ / %x32-37 )\n   The width limit of 63 on the base32 encoding is based on the\
    \ maximum\n   label limit as defined in Section 2.3.4 of [DNS].\n   See Appendix\
    \ A for an example of a query construction.\n"
- title: 4.4.  ATPS Reply Details
  contents:
  - "4.4.  ATPS Reply Details\n   In the descriptions below, the label NOERROR symbolizes\
    \ DNS response\n   code (\"rcode\") 0, and NXDOMAIN represents rcode 3.  See Section\
    \ 4.1.1\n   of [DNS] for further details.\n   At this time, only three possibilities\
    \ need to be identified in this\n   specification:\n   o  An answer is returned\
    \ (i.e., [DNS] reply code NOERROR with at\n      least one answer) containing\
    \ a valid ATPS reply.  In this case,\n      the protocol has been satisfied and\
    \ the Verifier can conclude that\n      the signing domain is authorized by the\
    \ ADMD to sign its mail.\n      Further queries SHOULD NOT be initiated.\n   o\
    \  No answer is returned (i.e., [DNS] reply code NXDOMAIN, or NOERROR\n      with\
    \ no answers), or one or more answers have been returned as\n      described above\
    \ but none contain a valid ATPS reply.  In this\n      case, the Signer has not\
    \ been authorized to act as a third-party\n      Signer for this ADMD, and thus\
    \ the Verifier MUST continue to the\n      next query, if any.\n   o  An error\
    \ is returned (i.e., any other [DNS] reply code).  It is no\n      longer possible\
    \ to determine whether or not this message satisfies\n      the ADMD's list of\
    \ authorized third-party Signers.  The Verifier\n      SHOULD stop processing\
    \ and defer the message for later processing,\n      such as requesting a temporary\
    \ failure code from the Mail Transfer\n      Agent (MTA).\n   If all queries are\
    \ completed and return either NXDOMAIN or NOERROR\n   with no answers, then the\
    \ Signer was not authorized by the ADMD.\n   A valid ATPS reply consists of a\
    \ sequence of tag=value pairs as\n   described in Section 3.2 of [DKIM].  The\
    \ following tags and values\n   are currently supported in ATPS records:\n   d:\
    \ Domain (plain-text; RECOMMENDED).  This tag includes a plain-text\n      copy\
    \ of the DNS domain being authorized as an ATPS Signer.  This\n      is included\
    \ to assist with collision detections; for example, if\n      the base32 encoding\
    \ of this name is not the same as the base32\n      portion of the query, or more\
    \ simply if this name is not the same\n      as that found in the \"atps\" tag,\
    \ a hash collision could have\n      occurred.  Its use where no name hashing\
    \ has occurred is\n      redundant.  The ABNF is as follows:\n      atps-d-tag\
    \ = %x64 [FWS] \"=\" [FWS] domain-name\n                 ; FWS is defined in [DKIM]\n\
    \   v: Version (plain-text; REQUIRED).  This tag indicates the version of\n  \
    \    the ATPS specification to which the record complies.  The record\n      MUST\
    \ be ignored if the value is not \"ATPS1\".  The ABNF is as\n      follows:\n\
    \      atps-v-tag = %x76 [FWS] \"=\" [FWS] %x41.54.50.53.31\n                \
    \ ; FWS is defined in [DKIM]\n"
- title: 5.  Interpretation
  contents:
  - "5.  Interpretation\n   For each DKIM signature that verifies (see Section 6 of\
    \ [DKIM]), if a\n   Verifier succeeds in confirming that the Author's ADMD authorized\
    \ the\n   ATPS Signer using this protocol, then the Verifier SHOULD evaluate\n\
    \   the message as though it contained a valid signature from the\n   Author's\
    \ ADMD.  It MAY also independently evaluate the ATPS Signer\n   when determining\
    \ message disposition.\n   This assertion is based on the fact that the ADMD explicitly\
    \ endorsed\n   the ATPS Signer.  Therefore, a module assessing reputation that\
    \ is\n   based on DKIM signature verification SHOULD apply the reputation of\n\
    \   the Author's ADMD domain instead of, or in addition to, that of the\n   ATPS\
    \ Signer domain.\n"
- title: 6.  Relationship to ADSP
  contents:
  - "6.  Relationship to ADSP\n   [ADSP] defined a protocol by which the owner of\
    \ an Author Domain can\n   advertise a request to message receivers that messages\
    \ bearing no\n   valid author signature be treated with suspicion or even discarded.\n\
    \   A Verifier implementing both Author Domain Signing Practices (ADSP)\n   and\
    \ ATPS MUST test ATPS first.  If ATPS indicates a valid delegation,\n   the Verifier\
    \ MUST act, with respect to ADSP, as though the message\n   has a valid Author\
    \ Domain Signature (because that's what the\n   delegation means), and no ADSP\

    \  sufficient.  However, this was not based on actual experience, as\n   there\
    \ is no specific history on this question.  Thus, this experiment\n   was devised.\n\
    \   The experimental protocol described here has been implemented as an\n   extension\
    \ to DKIM in two software products, one of which is open\n   source and seeing\
    \ increasingly wide use.  It is included there to\n   allow customers of those\
    \ systems to make use of it if they believe\n   such third-party assertions are\
    \ useful to the overall DKIM mechanism.\n   Further adoption as part of the experiment\
    \ is welcome and encouraged.\n   Use of the protocol and anecdotes of how it affects\
    \ the overall DKIM\n   experience will be collected by those implementers and\
    \ the author of\n   this memo.  Those participating in the experiment are also\
    \ advised to\n   observe and report the impact of what is discussed in Section\

- title: 9.1.  Hash Selection
  contents:
  - "9.1.  Hash Selection\n   The selection of the hash algorithm to be used (see\
    \ Section 4.1) has\n   security implications, as weaker algorithms have more risk\
    \ of\n   collision, meaning a second DNS domain name could in theory be\n   constructed\
    \ to appear to have been authorized by the Author ADMD.\n   At the time of publication\
    \ of [DKIM], use of SHA256 was preferred\n   over SHA1 for this reason, though\
    \ support for both has been\n   maintained.  See Section 3.3 of [DKIM] for additional\
    \ discussion.\n"
- title: 9.2.  False Privacy
  contents:
  - "9.2.  False Privacy\n   The fact that the authorized third-party domain name\
    \ is hashed and\n   then encoded with base32 might give some the false sense that\
    \ the\n   relationship between the two parties is somehow protected.  This is\n\
    \   not the case.  Indeed, the very purpose of this protocol is to make\n   it\
    \ possible for such relationships to be discovered, so such an\n   obscuration\
    \ would make that process more difficult without a shared\n   secret delivered\
    \ out-of-band to message verifiers (which also adds\n   further complexity). \
    \ Rather, the hash and encode steps are done\n   merely to convert any third-party\
    \ domain name to a fixed width in the\n   construction of the DNS query.\n"
- title: 9.3.  Transient Security Failures
  contents:
  - "9.3.  Transient Security Failures\n   Approving a third-party Signer exposes\
    \ the ADMD to the risk that the\n   third-party Signer becomes compromised and\
    \ then begins to sign\n   malicious or nuisance messages on behalf of the ADMD.\
    \  This can\n   obviously reflect negatively on the ADMD, and the impact of this\
    \ can\n   become more severe as automated domain reputation systems are\n   developed\
    \ and deployed.  Thorough vetting and monitoring practices by\n   ADMDs of third-party\
    \ Signers will likely need to become the norm.\n"
- title: 9.4.  Load on the DNS
  contents:
  - "9.4.  Load on the DNS\n   A Verifier participating in DKIM, ADSP, and ATPS will\
    \ now issue a\n   number of TXT queries to the DNS equal to as many as one (for\
    \ the\n   ADSP query) plus the number of signatures on the message (one for\n\
    \   each key that is to be verified) plus the number of signatures that\n   validated\
    \ and that also bear an \"atps\" tag.  This is in addition to\n   any PTR and\
    \ A queries the MTA might issue at the time the actual\n   message relaying or\
    \ delivery is initiated.  Obviously, this can be\n   burdensome on the DNS at\
    \ both ends, and waiting for that number of\n   queries to return when they are\
    \ issued in parallel could trigger\n   timeouts in the MTA.\n   An alternative\
    \ that has not yet been explored is the storage of the\n   ATPS data at a specific\
    \ URL tied to the Author's domain name.  This\n   would alleviate pressure on\
    \ the DNS at the expense of requiring the\n   ADMD to operate a web server (which\
    \ has its own security\n   implications) and the addition of the establishment\
    \ of a TCP\n   connection.  Moreover, the Verifier would be well advised to\n\
    \   implement caching of this data to prevent ATPS from being used as a\n   denial-of-service\
    \ vector.\n   See Section 8.5 of [DKIM] for further discussion of DNS-related\n\
    \   issues.\n"

  - "Appendix A.  Example Query and Reply\n   This section presents an example of\
    \ the use of this protocol to query\n   for a third-party authorization and discusses\
    \ the interpretation of\n   the result.\n   Presume a message for which the RFC5322.From\
    \ domain is \"example.com\",\n   and it bears two valid signatures, from \"one.example.net\"\
    \ and from\n   \"two.example.net\", each with an \"atps\" tag whose value is\n\
    \   \"example.com\", and an \"atpsh\" tag whose value is \"sha1\".  The\n   following\
    \ actions are taken:\n   1.  A SHA1 hash of \"one.example.net\" is computed and\
    \ then converted\n       to printable form using base32 encoding, resulting in\
    \ the string\n       \"QSP4I4D24CRHOPDZ3O3ZIU2KSGS3X6Z6\".\n   2.  A TXT query\
    \ is issued to\n       \"QSP4I4D24CRHOPDZ3O3ZIU2KSGS3X6Z6._atps.example.com\"\
    .\n   3.  If a valid reply arrives, the algorithm stops with [AUTHRES]\n     \
    \  result \"pass\".  If a DNS error code other than NXDOMAIN is\n       returned,\
    \ the algorithm stops with a result of \"temperror\" or\n       \"permerror\"\
    \ as appropriate.\n   4.  A SHA1 hash of \"two.example.net\" is computed and then\
    \ converted\n       to printable form using base32 encoding, resulting in the\
    \ string\n       \"ZTZGRRV3F45A4U6HLDKBF3ZCOW4V2AJX\".\n   5.  A TXT query is\
    \ issued to\n       \"ZTZGRRV3F45A4U6HLDKBF3ZCOW4V2AJX._atps.example.com\".\n\
    \   6.  If a valid reply arrives, the algorithm stops with [AUTHRES]\n       result\
    \ \"pass\".  If a DNS error code other than NXDOMAIN is\n       returned, the\
    \ algorithm stops with a result of \"temperror\" or\n       \"permerror\" as appropriate.\n\
