- title: 1.  Overview
  contents:
  - "1.  Overview\n   The purpose of this document is to define some metrics by which\
    \ DUA\n   products can be measured.  It should be first be noted that the use\n\
    \   of the term \"DUA\" is rather misleading.  There is an assumption here\n \
    \  that the DUA is implemented correctly and is able to \"talk\" valid\n   X.500\
    \ protocol: this is a sine qua non.  Instead, this document seeks\n   to draw\
    \ out the characteristics of Directory user interfaces.\n   However, the term\
    \ DUA is persisted with as it is used by most people\n   when referring to Directory\
    \ user interfaces.  The format of these DUA\n   metrics is essentially a questionnaire\
    \ which extracts a detailed\n   description of a user interface.  DUAs come in\
    \ very different forms.\n   Many make use of windowing environments, offering\
    \ a \"high-tech\" view\n   of the Directory, while others are designed to work\
    \ in a terminal\n   environment.  Some interfaces offer extensive control over\
    \ the\n   Directory, and thus may be well-suited to Directory managers, while\n\
    \   others are aimed more at the novice user.  Some interfaces are\n   configurable\
    \ to allow searches for any attribute in any part of the\n   DIT, while others\
    \ lack this generality but are focussed on handling\n   the most typical queries\
    \ well.  In many aspects, it is almost\n   impossible to say that one DUA is better\
    \ than other from looking at\n   the responses to question in this document. \
    \ A flexible management\n   tool will be better for management than a DUA aimed\
    \ at servicing\n   simple look-ups, and vice-versa.  Furthermore, in other areas,\
    \ there\n   are several radically different approaches to a problem, but it is\n\
    \   not as yet clear whether one approach is better than another.  One\n   example\
    \ of this is the extent to which a DUA provides an abstraction\n   of the underlying\
    \ DIT hierarchy, either emphasising the world as a\n   tree or trying to conceal\
    \ this from the user.\n   However, other aspects, such as whether the DUA can\
    \ actually find the\n   entries required, and if so, how quickly, can be directly\
    \ measured in\n   some way.  Throughout this document, some of the questions posed\
    \ are\n   annotated with a square-bracketed points score and an explanation as\n\
    \   to how the points should be allocated.  For example, a question might\n  \
    \ be appended with \"[2 if yes]\", indicating score 2 points for an\n   affirmative\
    \ answer to that question.  These points scores should be\n   collated in Table\
    \ 1 at the end of the document, and this table\n   constitutes a measure of the\
    \ DUA. The metrics are on a section by\n   section basis, which should help the\
    \ reader who is seeking, for\n   example, a DUA with good management capabilities\
    \ which runs on a wide\n   variety of platforms, to focus on the critical aspects\
    \ of a DUA for\n   the particular requirement.\n"

- title: 12.  Query Resolution
  contents:
  - "12.  Query Resolution\n   This section discusses the process of query resolution.\
    \  While two\n   DUAs may both be able to resolve a query using the same information,\n\
    \   one may do so much more quickly than the other.  Some DUAs may be\n   more\
    \ \"economic\" in their use of DAP operations to achieve the same\n   results.\
    \  Some DUAs may find the correct results even when the users'\n   input corresponds\
    \ rather weakly to Directory names.  Three aspects of\n   query resolution are\
    \ measured:\n    o  Does the DUA actually find the required entry?\n    o  If\
    \ the required entry is found, how many entries were returned as\n       well?\n\
    \    o  How \"expensive\" was the query in terms of underlying X.500\n       operations,\
    \ whether the query was resolved successfully or not?\n   The following set of\
    \ queries might all conceivably be resolved such\n   that the author's Directory\
    \ entry be found.  The queries are split\n   into 2 groups:  the first group SHOULD\
    \ pose no difficulties for a\n   reasonable DUA; the second group are more problematic.\
    \  In each case,\n   award [2] marks if the query found the author's entry successfully.\n\
    \   The expensiveness of each query should be measured using the\n   following\
    \ formula, which introduces the notion of SearchStones!  The\n   SearchStone rating\
    \ is calculated by adding together the total\n   operations used in attempting\
    \ to resolve a query, weighted thus:\n    o  Bind [5]\n    o  Read operation [1]\n\
    \    o  List operation [2]\n    o  Search single level for countries, organisations\
    \ or\n       localities [3]\n    o  Search single level for organisational units,\
    \ people or roles [3]\n    o  Search subtree [5]\n      Note: The single level\
    \ searches have been separated into two\n      categories in acknowledgement that\
    \ certain types of search are\n      much more likely to span multiple DSAs than\
    \ others.  The\n      weightings are the same for the moment because of the\n\
    \      pervasiveness of the Quipu implementation, which replicates all\n     \
    \ sibling entries in a single DSA, whatever the level in the DIT.\n   The notion\
    \ of SearchStones merits some further explanation and the\n   statement of some\
    \ caveats.\n   The idea is to give some broad brush view of the work being\n \
    \  undertaken by a DUA to retrieve an entry.  There will be some\n   correspondence\
    \ between a low SearchStone rating and a DUA responding\n   quickly, and vice-versa,\
    \ although this correlation is not consistent,\n   for reasons given below.  It\
    \ would be desirable to be able to have\n   some timing information for the resolution\
    \ of queries, but such\n   results would only be meaningful if the tests were\
    \ for target entries\n   widely distributed throughout the DIT. Maybe this is\
    \ something for\n   the future?  In the meantime it is worth noting some of the\
    \ factors\n   which militate against simple minded interpretation of the\n   SearchStones.\n\
    \    o  The DIT is not uniform, with the depth varying considerably\n    o  While\
    \ the DIT is currently mastered mostly by DSAs of a single\n       implementation,\
    \ this will be decreasingly the case, and other DSAs\n       may have very different\
    \ performance profiles.\n    o  Different directory domains are already adopting\
    \ different\n       strategies on information replication with profound performance\n\
    \       implications.\n    o  No weighting is given to different search filters,\
    \ or to boolean\n       combinations of filters.\n   While acknowledging the difficulty\
    \ of the exercise, there are counter\n   arguments:\n    o  Some DUAs are better\
    \ than others at finding the required results\n    o  Some DUAs will get the required\
    \ results more quickly than most\n    o  DUA designers have to build DUAs in the\
    \ knowledge that the DIT is\n       heterogeneous with respect to DSA implementation\
    \ and DIT structure\n   One possible way forward would be to refine the test queries\
    \ such\n   that they better represented the diversity of the DIT. However, as\
    \ a\n   first step, the tests are restricted to queries which could\n   reasonably\
    \ be constructed as searches for the author's entry.  The\n   author's entry is\
    \ held in part of the DIT which is representative of\n   much of the current DIT.\
    \  It is suggested that in order to normalise\n   the tests as much as possible,\
    \ that testing be performed by\n   connecting to the target DSA directly.  The\
    \ DSA's name is \"cn=Vicuna,\n   c=GB\", and the addresses of the DSA may be found\
    \ in the presentation\n   address attribute for that entry.  Note that the SearchStone\
    \ rating\n   should be shown even for queries which cannot be resolved.\n   First,\
    \ the straightforward queries:\n   50. NAME=Paul Barker, OU=Computer Science,\
