  - "1.  Introduction\n   The NFC Forum is a specification development body developing\n\
    \   technologies related to near-field communications.  This activity is\n   supported\
    \ by a membership comprised of chip vendors, smart card\n   vendors, equipment\
    \ vendors, software developers, finance and banking\n   service providers, content\
    \ providers, and other interested companies.\n   Some of the technologies being\
    \ developed by the NFC Forum need\n   namespaces that are managed so that they\
    \ are unique and persistent.\n   To ensure that the uniqueness is absolute, the\
    \ registration of a\n   specific NID for use by the NFC Forum was deemed appropriate.\n\
    \   Therefore, a full and complete registration will follow the namespace\n  \
    \ specification process as defined in [RFC3406].\n"

    \         Email:   TPM@nfc-forum.org\n   Declaration of syntactic structure:\n\
    \      The Namespace Specific String (NSS) of all URNs that use the \"nfc\"\n\
    \      NID will have the following structure:\n      urn:nfc:{NFCresource}:{ResourceSpecificString}\n\
    \      Where the \"{NFCresource}\" is a US-ASCII string that conforms to\n   \
    \   the URN syntax requirements [RFC2141] and defines a specific class\n     \
    \ of resource.  Each resource class has a specific labeling scheme\n      that\
    \ is covered by \"{ResourceSpecificString}\" which also conforms\n      to the\
    \ naming requirements of [RFC2141].\n      NFC Forum working groups will manage\
    \ the assignment of NFC\n      resources and the specific registration values\
    \ assigned for each\n      resource class.  The Technical Committee will coordinate\
    \ creation\n      of new resource class assignments based on community need.\n\
    \   Relevant ancillary documentation:\n      The NFC Forum publishes specifications\
    \ describing the use of\n      near-field communication for interoperable exchange\
    \ of information\n      between devices in close proximity.  Among these specifications\n\
    \      are the designation of new data types, schema, XML elements and\n     \
    \ attributes, protocols, and other formally named items intended for\n      machine\
    \ parsing.  Interested parties are referred to the NFC Forum\n      web site where\
    \ these publications will be made available to the\n      community:\n      http://www.nfc-forum.org/\n\
    \   Identifier uniqueness considerations:\n      The NFC Forum working groups\
    \ and Technical Committee will ensure\n      uniqueness of resource names assigned\
    \ by the NFC Forum within the\n      resource classes for which they are responsible.\n\
    \      When authority and responsibility for assignment of names with a\n    \
    \  resource class are delegated to an external organization,\n      commitment\
    \ to adhere to the uniqueness requirements of the\n      assigned resource names\
    \ will be a pre-condition of such\n      delegation.\n      The structure of the\
    \ NFC Forum namespace into resource classes\n      will further ensure isolation\
    \ of names in each class from names in\n      other classes.\n      It is anticipated\
    \ that some resource classes may be open to self-\n      assignment by any interested\
    \ individual or organization.  To\n      ensure a degree of uniqueness for these\
    \ self-assigned resource\n      names, fully-qualified domain names will be factored\
    \ into the name\n      to distinguish the naming authorities.\n      It should\
    \ be understood that due to the flexibility of the domain\n      name system and\
    \ the underlying market-based forces that allow for\n      ownership transfer\
    \ and abandonment of domain names, no guarantee\n      of long-term uniqueness\
    \ or persistence can be made for this class\n      of resource names beyond that\
    \ made for the domain names\n      themselves.\n   Identifier persistence considerations:\n\
    \      The NFC Forum will not reassign names and will thus guarantee the\n   \
    \   persistence of names beyond the expected lifetime of the named\n      resource.\
    \  NFC Forum does not anticipate operating a name\n      resolution service for\
    \ the assigned names and does not anticipate\n      any other usability issues\
    \ of the assigned names beyond those for\n      any other naturally aging technology.\n\
    \   Process of identifier assignment:\n      The NFC Forum will provide procedures\
    \ for registration of each\n      class of resource that it maintains.  Each such\
    \ resource may have\n      three types of registration activities:\n      1) Registered\
    \ names associated with NFC Forum specifications or\n         services;\n    \
    \  2) Registration of names or resource classes for other entities;\n      3)\
    \ Name models for use in experimental purposes.\n   Process for identifier resolution:\n\
    \      The namespace is not listed with a Resolution Discovery System\n      (RDS);\
    \ this is not relevant.\n   Rules for Lexical Equivalence:\n      No special considerations;\
    \ the rules for lexical equivalence of\n      [RFC2141] apply.\n   Conformance\
    \ with URN Syntax:\n      No special considerations.\n   Validation mechanism:\n\
    \      None specified.  URN assignment and registration will be handled\n    \
    \  by procedures implemented in support of NFC Forum activities.\n   Scope:\n\
    \      Global\n"

    \      an XML schema to describe an NFC Forum data transfer manifest.\n"
- title: 4.    Namespace Considerations
  contents:
  - "4.    Namespace Considerations\n   The NFC Forum is developing a variety of communication\
    \ protocol and\n   data exchange specifications.  Some of these specifications\
    \ depend\n   upon supporting information (e.g., data descriptions, attributes,\n\
    \   schema, etc.) to be fully specified.  For proper operation,\n   descriptions\
    \ of the needed supporting information must exist and be\n   available in a unique,\
    \ reliable, and persistent manner.  These\n   dependencies provide the basis of\
    \ need for namespaces, in one form or\n   another.\n   As type information is\
    \ relayed across NFC Forum protocols, the need\n   for compact, machine-parsed\
    \ type identification of data and meta-\n   content, with the attributes of uniqueness\
    \ and reliability mentioned\n   above, becomes imperative for proper interoperation\
    \ across widely\n   varied implementations.\n   As the NFC Forum work is ongoing\
    \ and covers many technical areas, the\n   possibility of using various other\
    \ namespace repositories has been\n   deemed impractical.  Each data object, description,\
    \ or schema as\n   defined in the NFC Forum could possibly be related to multiple\n\
    \   different other namespaces, so further conflicts of association might\n  \
    \ occur.  Thus, the intent is to utilize the requested URN namespace to\n   manage\
    \ NFC Forum-defined objects, descriptions, and schema.\n"
- title: 5.  Community Considerations
  contents:
  - "5.  Community Considerations\n   The objects and descriptions required for specifications\
    \ produced and\n   published by the NFC Forum are generally available for use\
    \ by other\n   organizations.  The NFC Forum will provide access and support for\n\
    \   name requests by these external organizations.  This support can be\n   enabled\
    \ in a timely and responsive fashion as new objects and\n   descriptions are produced.\n"
- title: 6.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "6.  Security Considerations\n   There are no additional security considerations\
    \ other than those\n   normally associated with the use and resolution of URNs\
    \ in general.\n"
