  - "1.  Introduction\n   Mobile IPv4 [RFC3344] can identify mobile nodes in various\
    \ ways,\n   including home addresses [RFC3344] and Network Access Identifiers\n\
    \   (NAIs) [RFC4282] [RFC2794].  In some Mobile IPv4 deployments,\n   identifying\
    \ the mobile node (MN) or the mobility service subscriber\n   via a Proxy Mobile\
    \ IPv4 client [LEUNG] (hereafter, the mobile node\n   and the Proxy Mobile IPv4\
    \ client are used interchangeably) is not\n   enough to distinguish among the\
    \ multiple services possibly\n   provisioned to the mobile node.\n   The capability\
    \ to specify different services in addition to the\n   mobile node's identity\
    \ can be leveraged to provide flexibility for\n   mobility service providers to\
    \ provide multiple services within the\n   same mobility service subscription.\
    \  For example:\n   o  Provide an enterprise data access for which the mobility\
    \ service\n      provider hosts connectivity and mobility services on behalf of\
    \ the\n      enterprise.\n   o  Provide access to service domains that are otherwise\
    \ not\n      accessible from public networks because of some mobility service\n\
    \      providers' business reasons.\n   o  Provide simultaneous access to different\
    \ service domains that are\n      separated based on policies of the mobility\
    \ service provider.\n   o  Enable easier policy assignment for mobility service\
    \ providers\n      based on the subscribed services.\n   This document describes\
    \ a Service Selection extension for Mobile IPv4\n   that is intended to assist\
    \ home agents to make specific service\n   selections for their mobility service\
    \ subscriptions during the\n   registration procedure.  A Mobile IPv6-equivalent\
    \ Service Selection\n   Mobility Option has been described in [RFC5149].  The\
    \ service\n   selection may affect home agent routing decisions, Home Address\n\
    \   assignment policies, firewall settings, and security policies.  When\n   the\
    \ service selection is used, every Registration Request must\n   contain the Service\
    \ Selection extension.  The Service Selection\n   extension from the Registration\
    \ Request may be echoed back in the\n   Registration Reply.\n   In absence of\
    \ a specifically indicated service, the home agent must\n   act as if the default\
    \ service, plain Internet access, had been\n   requested.  There is no absolute\
    \ requirement that this default\n   service would be allowed to all subscribers,\
    \ but it is highly\n   recommended in order to avoid having normal subscribers\
    \ employ\n   operator-specific configuration values in order to get basic service.\n\
    \   Some of the potential use cases were listed earlier in this section.\n   The\
    \ general aim is better manageability of services and service\n   provisioning,\
    \ from both operators' and service providers' points of\n   view.  However, it\
    \ should be understood that there are potential\n   deployment possibilities where\
    \ selecting a certain service may\n   restrict simultaneous access to other services\
    \ from a user point of\n   view (e.g., a \"walled garden\").  For example, services\
    \ may be located\n   in different administrative domains or external customer\
    \ networks\n   that practice excessive filtering of inbound and outbound traffic.\n"

- title: 3.  Service Selection Extension

  - "3.  Service Selection Extension\n   At most one Service Selection extension MAY\
    \ be included in any Mobile\n   IPv4 Registration Request message.  When the service\
    \ selection is\n   used, the Service Selection extension MUST be included in every\n\
    \   Registration Request message.  In absence of a specifically indicated\n  \
    \ service in the Registration Request for the initial registration or\n   re-registration,\
    \ the home agent MUST act as if the default service,\n   such as plain Internet\
    \ access, had been requested.  The Service\n   Selection extension MUST be placed\
    \ in the Registration Request\n   message as follows:\n   o  When present, the\
    \ extension MUST appear after the MN-NAI\n      extension, if the MN-NAI is also\
    \ present in the message.\n   o  If the extension was added by the mobile node\
    \ to a Registration\n      Request, it MUST appear prior to any authentication-enabling\n\
    \      extensions [RFC3344] [RFC4721].\n   o  In the event the foreign agent adds\
    \ the Service Selection\n      extension to a Registration Request, the extension\
    \ MUST appear\n      prior to any Foreign-Home authentication-enabling extensions\n\
    \      [RFC3344].\n   The home agent MAY echo the received Service Selection extension\n\
    \   option back in a Mobile IPv4 Registration Reply message.  The echoed\n   Service\
    \ Selection extension MUST be an unchanged copy of the Service\n   Selection extension\
    \ received in the corresponding Registration\n   Request message.  The Service\
    \ Selection extension MUST be placed in\n   the Registration Reply message as\
    \ follows:\n   o  If the extension was originally added by the mobile node to\
    \ a\n      Registration Request, it MUST appear in the Registration Reply\n  \
    \    prior to any authentication-enabling extensions [RFC3344]\n      [RFC4721].\n\
    \   o  If the foreign agent added the Service Selection extension to a\n     \
    \ Registration Request, the extension MUST appear in the\n      Registration Reply\
    \ prior to any Foreign-Home authentication-\n      enabling extensions [RFC3344].\n\
    \   The Service Selection extension has the following format:\n    0         \

  contents:
  - "4.1.  Mobile Node Considerations\n   A mobile node or its proxy representative\
    \ MAY include the Service\n   Selection extension into any Registration Request\
    \ message.  The\n   Service Selection extension can be used with any mobile node\n\
    \   identification method.  The extension is used to identify the service\n  \
    \ to be associated with the mobility session; if the service selection\n   is\
    \ used, the Service Selection extension MUST be included into every\n   Registration\
    \ Request message sent to a home agent.  If the mobile\n   node wishes to change\
    \ the selected service, it is RECOMMENDED that\n   the mobile node de-register\
    \ the existing binding with the home agent\n   before proceeding with a binding\
    \ registration for a different\n   service.  The provisioning of the service identifiers\
    \ to the mobile\n   node or its proxy representative is out of the scope of this\n\
    \   specification.\n   If the mobile node receives a Registration Reply message\
    \ with a Code\n   set to SERVICE_AUTHORIZATION_FAILED and the mobile node has\
    \ an\n   existing binding with the Home Address used in the failed\n   Registration\
    \ Request message, the mobile node MUST delete the\n   existing binding.  If there\
    \ is no existing binding, the mobile node\n   proceeds as with any failed initial\
    \ registration.\n"
- title: 4.2.  Home Agent Considerations
  contents:
  - "4.2.  Home Agent Considerations\n   Upon receiving the Service Selection extension,\
    \ the home agent\n   authenticates and authorizes the mobile node.  If the home\
    \ agent\n   supports the Service Selection, it MUST also verify that the mobile\n\
    \   node is authorized to the service identified by the Service Selection\n  \
    \ extension.  The services the mobile node is authorized to SHOULD be\n   part\
    \ of the general mobile node subscription data.  If the mobile\n   node is not\
    \ authorized to the service, or the home agent does not\n   recognize the identified\
    \ service, the home agent MUST deny the\n   registration and send a Registration\
    \ Reply with a Code\n   SERVICE_AUTHORIZATION_FAILED (error code 151).\n   The\
    \ Service Selection extension is used to assist the mobile node\n   authorization\
    \ phase and identifies a specific service that is to be\n   authorized.  The Service\
    \ Selection extension MAY also affect the Home\n   Address allocation when, for\
    \ example, used with the MN-NAI extension.\n   For example, for the same NAI,\
    \ there MAY be different Home Addresses,\n   depending on the identified service.\
    \  Furthermore, the Service\n   Selection extension MAY also affect the routing\
    \ of the outbound IP\n   packets in the home agent depending on the selected service.\
    \  The\n   home agent MAY also apply different policy or quality of service\n\
    \   treatment to traffic flows based on the selected service.\n   If the newly\
    \ arrived Registration Request message with a Service\n   Selection extension\
    \ indicates a change in the selected service, then\n   the home agent MUST re-authorize\
    \ the mobile node.  The absence of the\n   Service Selection extension MUST be\
    \ treated as a request for the\n   default service, which may also cause the re-authorization\
    \ of the\n   mobile node.  Depending on the home agent's policies, the services\n\
    \   policies, the Home Address allocation policies, and the subscription\n   policies,\
    \ the home agent may or may not be able to authorize the\n   mobile node to the\
    \ new service.  For example the existing service and\n   the new service could\
    \ require different Home Addresses.  If the\n   authorization fails, then the\
    \ home agent MUST deny the registration,\n   delete any binding with the existing\
    \ Home Address, and send a\n   Registration Reply with a Code set to SERVICE_AUTHORIZATION_FAILED\n\
    \   (error code 151).\n   Depending on the local home agent's policy, the home\
    \ agent MAY echo\n   the Service Selection extension in the corresponding Registration\n\
    \   Reply message towards the mobile node or the foreign agent.  The home\n  \
    \ agent MUST NOT change the content of the echoed Service Selection\n   extension.\n"
- title: 4.3.  Foreign Agent Considerations
  contents:
  - "4.3.  Foreign Agent Considerations\n   A foreign agent MUST skip the Service\
    \ Selection extension if the\n   Registration Request already contains the Service\
    \ Selection\n   extension.  If the Registration Request does not contain the Service\n\
    \   Selection extension, the foreign agent MAY add the Service Selection\n   extension\
    \ to the Registration Request message.  How the foreign agent\n   learns the service\
    \ that the mobile node needs to authorize is outside\n   the scope of this document.\n\
    \   In the case a foreign agent added the Service Selection extension to\n   the\
    \ Registration Request on behalf of the mobile node, it MUST verify\n   whether\
    \ the corresponding Registration Reply message from a home\n   agent also contains\
    \ an echoed Service Selection extension.  If the\n   received Registration Reply\
    \ message contains the echoed Service\n   Selection extension, the foreign agent\
    \ MUST NOT include the extension\n   to the Registration Reply message that gets\
    \ forwarded to the mobile\n   node.\n"
- title: 5.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "5.  Security Considerations\n   The protection for the Service Selection extension\
    \ depends on the\n   service that is being identified and eventually selected.\
    \  If the\n   service selection information should not be revealed on the wire,\
    \ it\n   should be protected in a manner similar to Registration Requests and\n\
    \   Registration Replies.  The Service Selection extension is protected\n   by\
    \ the same authentication-enabling extension as the rest of the\n   Registration\
    \ Request message.\n   The home agent MUST verify that the mobile node is authorized\
    \ to the\n   service included in the Service Selection extension.  The Service\n\
    \   Selection extension authorization is part of the normal mobile node\n   registration\
    \ and authentication procedure.  Both registration\n   authentication and service\
