  contents:
  - "1.1   Purpose.\n   This document supplements the Transport Service and Protocol\
    \ of the\n   International Standards Organization (ISO), IS 8072 and IS 8073,\n\
    \   respectively, and their formal descriptions by providing conventions,\n  \
    \ option selections and parameter values to be used when the protocol\n   is operated\
    \ within the scope of the applicability statement in\n   Paragraph 1.3 below.\
    \  Paragraph 1.4, below, describes the ISO\n   standards.  Full implementation\
    \ detail is not provided in this\n   document, but reference is made to a separate\
    \ document, entitled\n   \"Implementation Guide for the ISO Transport Protocol\"\
    , in which\n   guidance for implementation is given.\n"
- title: 1.2  Organization.
  contents:
  - "1.2  Organization.\n   Five sections comprise this supplement.  In Section 1,\
    \ the role and\n   purpose of the Transport Protocol are stated and the international\n\
    \   standards upon which the protocol is based are described.  These\n   documents,\
    \ as well as others supporting  the international standards\n   and this supplement\
    \ are listed in  Section 2.  Other definitions not\n   already included in the\
    \ international standards and supporting\n   documents are given in Section 3.\
    \  The international standards cover\n   a very wide variety of network environments\
    \ and situations.  There\n   is, thus, a collection of options and parameters\
    \ provided by the\n   standards which must be determined for specific uses.  Section\
    \ 4\n   states the options and parameters relevant to those implementations\n\
    \   to which this supplement applies, and defines usage conventions.\n   Conventions\
    \ for addressing and Transport connection reference\n   number usage and recovery\
    \ of the Transport connection from peer\n   deactivation are covered in Section\
    \ 5.\n"
- title: 1.3   Application.
  contents:
  - "1.3   Application.\n   The use of the Transport Protocol Class 4 and the Protocol\
    \ for\n   Providing the Connectionless-Mode Network Service (IS 8473) is\n   mandatory\
    \ foruse in all DOD packet-switched data networks where\n   there is a potential\
    \ for host-to-host connectivity across network\n   or subnetwork boundaries. \
    \ The term \"network\" as used here shall\n   include Local Area Networks but\
    \ not integrated weapons systems.\n   The use of the Transport Protocol Class\
    \ 4 and IS 8473 is\n   strongly encouraged, particularly  where a need for equipment\n\
    \   interchangeability or survivability is perceived. Use of the\n   Transport\
    \ Protocol Class 4 and IS 8473 in weapons systems, where\n   such usage does not\
    \ diminish required performance, is also\n   encouraged.\n"
- title: 1.4   International Standards Organization Transport Protocol.
  contents:
  - "1.4   International Standards Organization Transport Protocol.\n   The international\
    \ standard upon which this supplement is based is\n   described in four documents:\n\
    \       a. IS 8072, the Transport Service Definition, which defines the\n    \
    \      service that Transport provides to a user, described in\n          English\
    \ text;\n       b. WG4 N53, the Formal Description of the Transport Service, in\n\
    \          which the Transport Service is described using a formal\n         \
    \ description language;\n       c. IS 8073, the Transport Protocol, in which the\
    \ protocol is\n          specified in English text; and\n       d. N123, the formal\
    \ description of the Transport Protocol, in\n          which the specification\
    \ IS 8073 is written in a formal\n          description language.\n   The ISO\
    \ protocol has five classes of service, named Class 0 through\n   Class 4.  Only\
    \ Classes 4 and 2 will apply to this supplement.  The\n   formal description language,\
    \ Estelle, DP 9074, provides for protocol\n   descriptions in terms of communicating\
    \ finite state automata. It\n   contains a subset language which corresponds to\
    \ the international\n   standard Pascal.  The Class 4 protocol operation when\
    \ supported by a\n   connectionless network service is described in an addendum\
    \ to IS\n   8073, N3339(rev).\n"

    \          acknowledgements for received data:  each data transfer\n         \

    \ and\n   requirements for use of these options in implementations to which\n\
    \   this supplement applies are given in Paragraph 4.5.2.\n     a.   Withdrawal\
    \ of flow control credit--when supporting several\n          connections of differing\
    \ precedence or priority, resource\n          management must be practiced so\
    \ as to maintain the precedence\n          or priority relationships.\n     b.\
    \   Flow control confirmation--when flow control credit is\n          reduced,\
    \ extra delay may be encountered because\n          acknowledgements carrying\
    \ new flow control information are\n          lost; this procedure aids in speeding\

    \ procedure alleviates ambiguity due to\n          lost or out-of-order acknowledgements.\n\
    \     d.   Splitting over network connection--when operating over a\n        \
    \  connection-oriented network service, a Class 4 implementation\n          is\
    \ permitted to use more than one network connection, for\n          better performance\
    \ and better resilience to network connection\n          failure.\n     e.   Acknowledgement\
    \ strategy--an implementation is not required by\n          the standard to use\
    \ any particular strategy for sending\n          acknowledgements for received\
    \ data:  each data transfer\n          protocol data unit may be explicitly acknowledged\

    \       acknowledgement (one-for-N).\n     f.   Wait-before-closing state--when\
    \ a connect request has been\n          sent to the peer and the user has requested\
    \ a disconnection\n          before the connect confirmation has been received,\
    \ an\n          implementation may elect to wait until the confirmation has\n\

    \ network resources, an implementation may elect to share a\n          network\
    \ connection among two or more transport connections.\n     h.   Concatenation\
    \ of protocol data units--when network service\n          data units are large\
    \ compared to the protocol data units to be\n          sent, an implementation\
    \ may elect to concatenate these\n          protocol data units into a single\
    \ network service data unit.\n     i.   Checksum algorithm--the Fletcher checksum\
    \ algorithm provided\n          in an annex to the standard is not part of the\
    \ standard and is\n          provided for information only.  The checksum algorithm\

    \          summation criterion given in the standard.\n     j.   Send network\
    \ RESET when bad checksum received--it may not be\n          possible to know\
    \ with certainty which of several transport\n          connections multiplexed\
    \ on a network connection is to receive\n          a protocol data unit which\
    \ carries a bad checksum.  A N-RESET\n          or N-DISCONNECT may be sent on\
    \ the network connection to all\n          transport entities on the connection\
    \ to indicate the error.\n     k.   Protocol data unit retransmission policy--protocol\
    \ data units\n          for which no acknowledgement has been received may be\n\
    \          retransmitted in case the originals were never received.\n        \
    \  Whether to retransmit only the oldest unacknowledged protocol\n          data\
    \ unit or all those that are outstanding has implications\n          for buffer\

    \ timer, so that re-use of a reference number does not\n   cause ambiguity in\
    \ communications. However, certain requirements\n   are imposed on DOD implementations,\
    \ so that this means of reference\n   number control is inadequate alone. The\
    \ ISO standard defines only\n   those actions to be followed if a timer is used.\
    \  Other means of\n   reference number control are not prohibited, providing that\

    \ this interval is used, then\n   R shall be prohibited from being selected again\
    \ until all the\n   numbers R+1,...,N,1,2,...,R-1 shall have been used.  The choice\n\
    \   of N should be sufficiently large that the expected recycle period\n   exceeds\
    \ the minimum freeze time as specified in IS 8073.  This\n   requirement is in\
    \ addition to and does not supersede the freeze\n   requirement of IS 8073.  A\

    \ this supplement applies are required to\n   operate over connectionless network\
    \ services in addition to being\n   able to operate over connection-oriented network\
    \ services. The ISO\n   standard specifies transport only for operation over a\n\
    \   connection-oriented network.  However, the specification for Class\n   4 has\
    \ been written in such a way that use with connectionless\n   network service\
    \ is not precluded.  The formal description offers\n   even more flexibility in\
    \ this regard.  Consequently, operation over\n   connectionless network services,\
    \ whether a LAN or IP, is primarily\n   an implementation issue for Class 4. \
    \ Operation of Class 2\n   transportover a connectionless network service is not\
    \ considered\n   to be a reasonable  option because of the lack of sufficent error\n\
    \   recovery in Class 2.   For the purposes of this supplement,\n   operation\
    \ of Class 2 on a  connectionless network service is\n   not recommended. Operation\
