- title: Abstract
  contents:
  - "Abstract\n   This memo documents a process intended to organize the future\n\
    \   development of the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) and related work\n  \
    \ in the Real-time Applications and Infrastructure (RAI) Area.  As the\n   environments\
    \ in which SIP is deployed grow more numerous and diverse,\n   modifying or extending\
    \ SIP in certain ways may threaten the\n   interoperability and security of the\
    \ protocol; however, the IETF\n   process must also cater to the realities of\
    \ existing deployments and\n   serve the needs of the implementers working with\
    \ SIP.  This document\n   therefore defines the functions of two long-lived working\
    \ groups in\n   the RAI Area that are, respectively, responsible for the maintenance\n\
    \   of the core SIP specifications and the development of new efforts to\n   extend\
    \ and apply work in this space.  This document obsoletes RFC\n   3427.\n"

- title: 1.  History and Development
  contents:
  - "1.  History and Development\n   The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) [RFC3261]\
    \ has grown well beyond\n   its origins in Internet-based multimedia sessions\
    \ and now enjoys\n   widespread popularity in Voice-over-IP or IP telephony applications,\n\
    \   both inside IETF and within other standards groups.  One result of\n   this\
    \ popularity has been a continual flood of proposals for SIP\n   modifications\
    \ and extensions.  The challenge for IETF management of\n   SIP has been to preserve\
    \ baseline interoperability across its many\n   implementations\n   In order to\
    \ defend SIP against changes that might reduce\n   interoperability, the working\
    \ group chairs and Area Directors\n   responsible for its management authored\
    \ the SIP change process\n   [RFC3427].  That document defined the role of the\
    \ SIP and SIPPING\n   Working Groups (WGs) in shepherding ongoing work on the\
    \ SIP standard.\n   It also defined ways that external working groups or bodies\
    \ can\n   define extensions intended for limited usage, especially through the\n\
    \   \"P-\" header field mechanism.\n   Over time, however, the management structure\
    \ of RFC 3427 has\n   demonstrated some limitations.  The first and most significant\
    \ of\n   these concerns \"P-\" header fields.  While \"P-\" header fields require\n\
    \   expert review and IESG shepherding, in practice IETF oversight of\n   these\
    \ header fields is quite limited, and the value added by the IETF\n   supervising\
    \ their development remains unclear.  More importantly, the\n   presence of a\
    \ \"P-\" in front of a header field name does nothing to\n   prevent a popular\
    \ header field from seeing deployment outside of the\n   original \"limited usage\"\
    \ it envisioned; a prominent example of this\n   today is the P-Asserted-Identity\
    \ (PAID) header field, described in\n   RFC3325 [RFC3325].\n   Consequently, this\
    \ document obsoletes RFC 3427 and describes a new\n   structure for the management\
    \ of deliverables in the Real-time\n   Applications and Infrastructure Area.\n"
- title: 1.1.  The IETF SIPCORE Working Group
  contents:
  - "1.1.  The IETF SIPCORE Working Group\n   Historically, the IETF SIP Working Group\
    \ (sip) was chartered to be\n   the \"owner\" of the SIP protocol [RFC3261] for\
    \ the duration of the\n   working group.  All changes or extensions to SIP were\
    \ first required\n   to exist as SIP Working Group documents.  The SIP Working\
    \ Group was\n   charged with being the guardian of the SIP protocol for the Internet,\n\
    \   and therefore was mandated only to extend or change the SIP protocol\n   when\
    \ there were compelling reasons to do so.\n   The SIPCORE Working Group replaces\
    \ the function of the SIP Working\n   Group in the original [RFC3427] account.\
    \  Documents that must be\n   handled by the SIPCORE Working Group include all\
    \ documents that\n   update or obsolete RFCs 3261 through 3265 or their successors.\
    \  All\n   SIP extensions considered in SIPCORE must be Standards Track.  They\n\
    \   may be based upon requirements developed externally in other IETF\n   working\
    \ groups.\n   Typical IETF working groups do not live forever; however, SIPCORE's\n\
    \   charter is open-ended in order to allow it to remain the place where\n   core\
    \ SIP development will continue.  In the event that the SIPCORE\n   Working Group\
    \ has closed and no suitable replacement or follow-on\n   working group is active\
    \ (and this specification also has not been\n   superseded), then when modifications\
    \ to the core SIP protocol are\n   proposed, the RAI Area Directors will use the\
    \ non-working-group\n   Standards Track document process (described in Section\
    \ 6.1.2 of RFC\n   2026 [RFC2026]) using the SIPCORE mailing list and Designated\
    \ Experts\n   from the SIP community for review.\n   It is appropriate for any\
    \ IETF working group to develop SIP event\n   packages [RFC3265], but the working\
    \ group must have charter approval\n   to do so.  The IETF will also require [RFC5226]\
    \ IETF Review for the\n   registration of event packages developed outside the\
    \ scope of an IETF\n   working group.  Instructions for event package registrations\
    \ are\n   provided in Section 4.1.\n"
- title: 1.2.  The IETF DISPATCH Working Group
  contents:
  - "1.2.  The IETF DISPATCH Working Group\n   Historically, the IETF Session Initiation\
    \ Protocol Proposal\n   Investigation (sipping) Working Group was chartered to\
    \ be a filter in\n   front of the SIP Working Group.  This working group investigated\n\
    \   requirements for applications of SIP, some of which led to requests\n   for\
    \ extensions to SIP.  These requirements may come from the\n   community at large\
    \ or from individuals who are reporting the\n   requirements as determined by\
    \ another standards body.\n   The DISPATCH Working Group replaces the function\
    \ of the SIPPING WG,\n   although with several important changes to its functionality\
    \ -- the\n   most notable being that its scope expands beyond just SIP to the\n\
    \   entire work of the RAI Area.  Like SIPPING, DISPATCH considers new\n   proposals\
    \ for work in the RAI Area, but rather than taking on\n   specification deliverables\
    \ as charter items itself, DISPATCH\n   identifies the proper venue for work.\
    \  If no such venue yet exists in\n   the RAI Area, DISPATCH will develop charters\
    \ and consensus for a BoF,\n   working group, or exploratory group [RFC5111] as\
    \ appropriate.  Unlike\n   the previous change structure, a DISPATCH review of\
    \ any proposed\n   change to core SIP is not required before it progresses to\
    \ SIPCORE;\n   however, any new proposed work that does not clearly fall within\
    \ the\n   charter of an existing RAI Area effort should be examined by\n   DISPATCH.\n\
    \   In reaction to a proposal, the DISPATCH Working Group may determine\n   that:\n\
    \   1.  these requirements justify a change to the core SIP\n       specifications\
    \ (RFCs 3261 through 3265) and thus any resulting\n       work must transpire\
    \ in SIPCORE;\n   2.  these requirements do not change the SIP core specifications\
    \ but\n       require a new effort in the RAI Area (be that a working group, a\n\
    \       BoF, or what have you);\n   3.  these requirements fall within the scope\
    \ of existing chartered\n       work in the RAI Area; or\n   4.  the proposal\
    \ should not be acted upon at this time.\n   Because the SIP protocol gets so\
    \ much attention, some application\n   designers may want to use it just because\
    \ it is there, such as for\n   controlling household appliances.  DISPATCH should\
    \ act as a filter,\n   accepting only proposals that play to the strengths of\
    \ SIP, not those\n   that confuse its applicability or ultimately reduce its usefulness\
    \ as\n   a means for immediate personal communications on the Internet.\n   In\
    \ practice, it is expected that the DISPATCH WG behaves as a RAI\n   \"Open Area\"\
    \ working group, similar to those employed in other areas\n   of the IETF.  While\
    \ it does not have the traditional deliverables of\n   a working group, DISPATCH\
    \ may, at the discretion of its chairs and\n   Area Directors, adopt milestones\
    \ in accordance with standard working\n   group milestone-adoption procedures,\
    \ such as the production of\n   charter text for a BoF or working group, a \"\
    -00\" problem statement\n   document that explicates a proposed work effort, or\
    \ a document\n   explaining why a particular direction for standards development\
    \ was\n   not pursued.\n"

    \ NOT\", \"SHOULD\",\n   and \"SHOULD NOT\", are to be interpreted as described\

    \ IANA\n   registrations.\n"
- title: 3.  Introducing New Work to RAI
  contents:
  - "3.  Introducing New Work to RAI\n   As with any new work in the IETF, proposals\
    \ are best formulated in\n   individual Internet-Drafts.  New ideas arising within\
    \ the chartered\n   scope of a RAI Area working group naturally should be treated\
    \ as\n   candidates for adoption as a working group item there.  Experience\n\
    \   has demonstrated that authoring a problem statement or set of initial\n  \
    \ requirements prior to (or at least separately from) submitting a\n   protocol\
    \ mechanism speeds the consensus-making process significantly.\n   A problem statement\
    \ should explain what problem needs to be solved,\n   why existing mechanisms\
    \ are insufficient, and, for proposals to\n   modify SIP, why SIP is the appropriate\
    \ solution for this problem.  A\n   problem statement must also detail any security\
    \ issues that may\n   result from meeting these requirements.  When proposed new\
    \ work does\n   not fall within the bounds of existing RAI Area working group\n\
    \   charters, the DISPATCH Working Group assists the authors of\n   proposals,\
    \ the RAI Area Directors and the RAI community to decide the\n   best way to approach\
    \ the problem.  Authors of proposals may submit\n   their problem statements to\
    \ the DISPATCH Working Group for community\n   consideration and review.\n   The\
    \ DISPATCH Working Group chairs, in conjunction with the RAI Area\n   Directors,\
    \ will determine if the particular problems raised in the\n   requirements problem\
    \ statement are indeed outside the charter of\n   existing efforts and, if so,\
    \ if they warrant a DISPATCH milestone for\n   the definition of a new effort;\
    \ this DISPATCH deliverable may take\n   the form of a problem statement Internet-Draft,\
    \ charter, or similar\n   milestone that provides enough information to make a\
    \ decision, but\n   must not include protocol development.  The DISPATCH Working\
    \ Group\n   should consider whether the requirements can be merged with other\n\
    \   requirements from other applications, and refine the problem\n   statement\
    \ accordingly.\n   Once a new effort has been defined in DISPATCH and there is\
    \ working\n   group consensus that it should go forward, if the new effort will\n\
    \   take the form of a working group or BoF, then the ADs will present\n   the\
    \ proposed new effort charter to the IESG and IAB, in accordance\n   with the\
    \ usual chartering process.  If the new effort involves the\n   rechartering of\
    \ an existing working group, then similarly the\n   existing working group rechartering\
    \ functions will be performed by\n   the appropriate WG chairs and ADs.  If the\
    \ IESG (with IAB advice)\n   approves of the new charter or BoF, the DISPATCH\
    \ Working Group has\n   completed its deliverable and the new effort becomes autonomous.\n\
    \   Anyone proposing requirements for new work is welcome to jointly\n   develop,\
    \ in a separate Internet-Draft, a mechanism that would meet\n   the requirements.\
    \  No working group is required to adopt the proposed\n   solution from this additional\
    \ Internet-Draft.\n   Work overseen by the SIPCORE Working Group is required to\
    \ protect the\n   architectural integrity of SIP and must not add features that\
    \ do not\n   have general use beyond the specific case.  Also, SIPCORE must not\n\
    \   add features just to make a particular function more efficient at the\n  \
    \ expense of simplicity or robustness.\n   The DISPATCH process is not the sole\
    \ place that requirements for new\n   work are considered in the RAI Area.  For\
    \ example, some working\n   groups generate requirements for SIP solutions and/or\
    \ extensions.\n   At the time this document was written, groups with such chartered\n\
    \   deliverables include SIP for Instant Messaging and Presence\n   Leveraging\
    \ Extensions (simple), Basic Level of Interoperability for\n   SIP Services (bliss)\
    \ and Session Peering for Multimedia Interconnect\n   (speermint).  The work of\
    \ these and similar groups is not affected by\n   the DISPATCH process.\n   Of\
    \ course, the RAI Area Directors may accept charter revisions from\n   existing\
    \ working groups that add new milestones or scope to their\n   charters at their\
    \ discretion, in the standard IETF manner, without\n   any actions on the part\
    \ of the DISPATCH Working Group.  DISPATCH\n   exists to assist new work in finding\
    \ a home expeditiously in those\n   cases where it does not naturally fall into\
    \ an existing bucket.\n"
- title: 4.  Extensibility and Architecture
  contents:
  - "4.  Extensibility and Architecture\n   In an idealized protocol model, extensible\
    \ design would be self-\n   contained, and it would be inherent that new extensions\
    \ and new\n   header fields would naturally have an architectural coherence with\n\
    \   the original protocol.\n   However, this idealized vision has not been attained\
    \ in the world of\n   Standards Track protocols.  While interoperability implications\
    \ can\n   be addressed by capabilities negotiation rules, the effects of adding\n\
    \   features that overlap, or that deal with a point solution and are not\n  \
    \ general, are much harder to control with rules.  Therefore, the RAI\n   Area\
    \ calls for architectural guardianship and application of Occam's\n   Razor by\
    \ the SIPCORE and DISPATCH Working Groups.\n   In keeping with the IETF tradition\
    \ of \"running code and rough\n   consensus\", it is valid to allow for the development\
    \ of SIP\n   extensions that are either not ready for Standards Track, but might\n\
    \   be understood for that role after some running code or are private or\n  \
    \ proprietary in nature because a characteristic motivating them is\n   usage\
    \ that is known not to fit the Internet architecture for SIP.  In\n   the past,\
    \ header fields associated with those extensions were called\n   \"P-\" header\
    \ fields for \"preliminary\", \"private\", or \"proprietary\".\n   However, the\
    \ \"P-\" header field process has not served the purpose for\n   which it was\
    \ designed -- namely, to restrict to closed environments\n   the usage of mechanisms\
    \ the IETF would not (yet) endorse for general\n   usage.  In fact, some \"P-\"\
    \ header fields have enjoyed widespread\n   implementation; because of the \"\
    P-\" prefix, however, there seems to\n   be no plausible migration path to designate\
    \ these as general-usage\n   header fields without trying to force implausible\
    \ changes on large\n   installed bases.\n   Accordingly, this specification deprecates\
    \ the previous [RFC3427]\n   guidance on the creation of \"P-\" header fields.\
    \  Existing \"P-\" header\n   fields are to be handled by user agents and proxy\
    \ servers as the \"P-\"\n   header field specifications describe; the deprecation\
    \ of the change\n   process mechanism entails no change in protocol behavior.\
    \  New\n   proposals to document SIP header fields of an experimental or private\n\
    \   nature, however, shall not use the \"P-\" prefix (unless existing\n   deployments\
    \ or standards use the prefix already, in which case they\n   may be admitted\
    \ as grandfathered cases at the discretion of the\n   Designated Expert).\n  \
    \ Instead, the registration of SIP header fields in Informational RFCs,\n   or\
    \ in documents outside the IETF, is now permitted under the\n   Designated Expert\
    \ (per [RFC5226]) criteria.  The future use of any\n   header field name prefix\
    \ (\"P-\" or \"X-\" or what have you) to designate\n   SIP header fields of limited\
    \ applicability is discouraged.  Experts\n   are advised to review documents for\
    \ overlap with existing chartered\n   work in the RAI Area, and are furthermore\
    \ instructed to ensure the\n   following two criteria are met:\n   1.  The proposed\
    \ header field MUST be of a purely informational\n       nature and MUST NOT significantly\
    \ change the behavior of SIP\n       entities that support it.  Header fields\
    \ that merely provide\n       additional information pertinent to a request or\
    \ a response are\n       acceptable; these header fields are thus expected to\
    \ have few, if\n       any, implications for interoperability and backwards\n\
    \       compatibility.  Similarly, header fields that provide data\n       consumed\
    \ by applications at the ends of SIP's rendezvous\n       function, rather than\
    \ changing the behavior of the rendezvous\n       function, are likely to be providing\
    \ information in this sense.\n       If the header fields redefine or contradict\
    \ normative behavior\n       defined in Standards Track SIP specifications, that\
    \ is what is\n       meant by significantly different behavior.  Ultimately, the\n\
    \       significance of differences in behavior is a judgment call that\n    \
    \   must be made by the expert reviewer.\n   2.  The proposed header field MUST\
    \ NOT undermine SIP security in any\n       sense.  The Internet-Draft proposing\
    \ the new header field MUST\n       address security issues in detail, as if it\
    \ were a Standards\n       Track document.  Note that, if the intended application\
    \ scenario\n       makes certain assumptions regarding security, the security\n\
    \       considerations only need to meet the intended application\n       scenario\
    \ rather than the general Internet case.  In any case,\n       security issues\
    \ need to be discussed for arbitrary usage\n       scenarios (including the general\
    \ Internet case).\n   Note that the deprecation of the \"P-\" header field process\
    \ does not\n   alter processes for the registration of SIP methods, URI parameters,\n\
    \   response codes, or option tags.\n"
- title: 4.1.  SIP Event Packages
  contents:
  - "4.1.  SIP Event Packages\n   SIP events [RFC3265] defines two different types\
    \ of event packages:\n   normal event packages and event template-packages.  Event\
    \ template-\n   packages can only be created and registered by the publication\
    \ of a\n   Standards Track RFC (from an IETF Working Group).  Note that the\n\
    \   guidance in [RFC3265] states that the IANA registration policy for\n   normal\
    \ event packages is \"First Come First Serve\"; this document\n   replaces that\
    \ policy with the following:\n   Individuals may wish to publish SIP Event packages\
    \ that they believe\n   fall outside the scope of any chartered work currently\
    \ in RAI.\n   Individual proposals for registration of a SIP event package MUST\n\
    \   first be published as Internet-Drafts for review by the DISPATCH\n   Working\
    \ Group, or the working group, mailing list, or expert\n   designated by the RAI\
    \ Area Directors if the DISPATCH Working Group\n   has closed.  Proposals should\
    \ include a strong motivational section,\n   a thorough description of the proposed\
    \ syntax and semantics, event\n   package considerations, security considerations,\
    \ and examples of\n   usage.  Authors should submit their proposals as individual\
    \ Internet-\n   Drafts and post an announcement to the working group mailing list\
    \ to\n   begin discussion.  The DISPATCH Working Group will determine if a\n \
    \  proposed package is\n   a)  an appropriate usage of SIP that should be spun\
    \ into a new\n       effort,\n   b)  applicable to SIP but not sufficiently interesting,\
    \ general, or\n       in-scope to adopt as a working group effort,\n   c)  contrary\
    \ to similar work chartered in an existing effort, or\n   d)  recommended to be\
    \ adopted as or merged with chartered work\n       elsewhere in RAI.\n   \"RFC\
    \ Required\" in conjunction with \"Designated Expert\" (both as\n   defined in\

    \ outside the scope of an IETF working group,\n   according to the following guidelines:\n\
    \   1.  A Designated Expert (as defined in RFC 5226) must review the\n       proposal\
    \ for applicability to SIP and conformance with these\n       guidelines.  The\
    \ Designated Expert will send email to the IESG on\n       this determination.\
    \  The expert reviewer can cite one or more of\n       the guidelines that have\
    \ not been followed in his/her opinion.\n   2.  The proposed extension MUST NOT\
    \ define an event template-package.\n   3.  The function of the proposed package\
    \ MUST NOT overlap with\n       current or planned chartered packages.\n   4.\
    \  The event package MUST NOT redefine or contradict the normative\n       behavior\
    \ of SIP events [RFC3265], SIP [RFC3261], or related\n       Standards Track extensions.\
    \  (See Section 4.)\n   5.  The proposed package MUST NOT undermine SIP security\
    \ in any\n       sense.  The Internet-Draft proposing the new package MUST address\n\
    \       security issues in detail as if it were a Standards Track\n       document.\
    \  Security issues need to be discussed for arbitrary\n       usage scenarios\
    \ (including the general Internet case).\n   6.  The proposed package MUST be\
    \ clearly documented in an\n       (Individual) Informational RFC and registered\
    \ with IANA.  The\n       package MUST document all the package considerations\
    \ required in\n       Section 4 of SIP events [RFC3265].\n   7.  If determined\
    \ by the Designated Expert or the chairs or ADs of\n       the DISPATCH WG, an\
    \ applicability statement in the Informational\n       RFC MUST clearly document\
    \ the useful scope of the proposal, and\n       explain its limitations and why\
    \ it is not suitable for the\n       general use of SIP in the Internet.\n"

  contents:
  - "6.  Security Considerations\n   Complex, indeterminate, and hard-to-define protocol\
    \ behavior,\n   depending on the interaction of many optional extensions, is a\
    \ fine\n   breeding ground for security flaws.\n   All Internet-Drafts that present\
    \ new requirements for SIP must\n   include a discussion of the security requirements\
    \ and implications\n   inherent in the proposal.  All RFCs that modify or extend\
    \ SIP must\n   show that they have adequate security, must consider the security\n\
    \   implications of feature interactions, and most of all must not worsen\n  \
    \ SIP's existing security considerations.\n"
- title: 7.  IANA Considerations
  contents:
  - "7.  IANA Considerations\n   RFC 3261 directs the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority\
    \ (IANA) to\n   establish a registry for SIP method names, a registry for SIP\
    \ option\n   tags, and a registry for SIP response codes, and to amend the\n \
    \  practices used for the existing registry for SIP header fields.\n   Reiterating\
    \ the guidance of RFC 3261, method names, option tags, and\n   SIP response codes\
    \ require a Standards Action for inclusion in the\n   IANA registry.  Authors\
    \ of specifications should also be aware that\n   the SIP parameter registry is\
    \ further elaborated in [RFC3968].\n   Previously in RFC 3427, all new SIP header\
    \ field registrations\n   required a Standards Action (per RFC 5226) with the\
    \ exception of \"P-\"\n   header fields; now, Informational registration of non-\"\
    P-\" header\n   fields is permitted if approved by a Designated Expert, as described\n\
    \   in Section 4.\n   Each RFC shall include an IANA Considerations section that\
    \ directs\n   IANA to create appropriate registrations.  Registration shall be\
    \ done\n   at the time the IESG announces its approval of the draft containing\n\
    \   the registration requests.\n   Standard header fields and messages MUST NOT\
    \ begin with the leading\n   characters \"P-\".  Existing \"P-\" header field\
    \ registrations are\n   considered grandfathered, but new registrations of Informational\n\
    \   header fields should not begin with the leading characters \"P-\"\n   (unless\
    \ the \"P-\" would preserve compatibility with a pre-existing,\n   unregistered\
    \ usage of the header field, at the discretion the\n   Designated Expert).  Short\
    \ forms of header fields MUST only be\n   assigned to Standards Track header fields.\n\
    \   Similarly, [RFC3265] directs the IANA to establish a registry for SIP\n  \
    \ event packages and SIP event template-packages.  For event template-\n   packages,\
    \ registrations must follow the [RFC5226] processes for\n   Standards Action within\
    \ an IETF working group.  For normal event\n   packages, as stated previously,\
    \ registrations minimally require\n   [RFC5226] \"RFC Required\" with \"Designated\
    \ Expert\".  In either case,\n   the IESG announcement of RFC approval authorizes\
    \ IANA to make the\n   registration.\n"
- title: 7.1.  Clarification of RFC 3969
  contents:
  - "7.1.  Clarification of RFC 3969\n   [RFC3969] stipulates that the (original)\
    \ [RFC2434] rule of\n   \"Specification Required\" applies to registrations of\
    \ new SIP URI\n   parameters; however, Section 3 of that same document mandates\
    \ that a\n   Standards Action is required to register new parameters with the\n\
    \   IANA.  This contradiction arose from a misunderstanding of the nature\n  \
    \ of the [RFC2434] categories; the intention was for the IANA\n   Considerations\
    \ to mandate that Standards Action is required.\n"

  contents:
  - "8.  Overview of Changes to RFC 3427\n   This section provides a high-level overview\
    \ of the changes between\n   this document and RFC 3427.  It is not a substitute\
    \ for the document\n   as a whole -- the details are necessarily not represented.\n\
    \   This document:\n   1.  Changes the description of the SIP and SIPPING WG functions\
    \ to\n       the SIPCORE and DISPATCH WG functions using the context of the\n\
    \       RAI Area.\n   2.  Deprecates the process for \"P-\" header field registration,\
    \ and\n       changes the requirements for registration of SIP header fields of\n\
    \       a purely informational nature.\n   3.  Updates IANA registry requirements,\
    \ reflecting the publication of\n       RFC 5226, clarifying the policies in RFC\
    \ 3969, and clarifying\n       that the original RFC 3237 updated the policies\
    \ in RFC 3265.\n"

  - "9.  Acknowledgments\n   The credit for the notion that SIP required careful management\n\
    \   belongs to the original authors: Allison Mankin, Scott Bradner, Rohan\n  \
    \ Mahy, Dean Willis, Joerg Ott, and Brian Rosen.  The current editors\n   have\
    \ provided only an update to reflect lessons learned from running\n   the code\
    \ and from the changing situation of the IETF and the IANA\n   registration procedures.\
    \  Gonzalo Camarillo was instrumental to the\n   development of the concept of\
    \ SIPCORE and DISPATCH.  Useful comments\n   were provided by Jonathan Rosenberg,\
    \ Mary Barnes, Dan York, John\n   Elwell, Alan Johnston, Spencer Dawkins, Alfred\
    \ Hoenes, Russ Housley,\n   and Dean Willis.  The thorough review from Stephen\
    \ Hanna of the\n   Security Directorate proved enormously valuable.  The authors\
    \ also\n   appreciated IESG feedback from Alexey Melnikov, Adrian Farrel, Dan\n\
    \   Romascanu, and Magnus Westerlund.\n   The original authors thanked their IESG\
    \ and IAB colleagues\n   (especially Randy Bush, Harald Alvestrand, John Klensin,\
    \ Leslie\n   Daigle, Patrik Faltstrom, and Ned Freed) for valuable discussions\
    \ of\n   extensibility issues in a wide range of protocols, including those\n\
    \   that our area brings forward and others.  Thanks to the many members\n   of\
    \ the SIP community engaged in interesting dialogue about this\n   document as\
    \ well, including and especially Jonathan Rosenberg,\n   Henning Schulzrinne,\
    \ and William Marshall.\n"
