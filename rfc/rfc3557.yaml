  - "2.  Introduction\n   Motivated by technology advances in the field of speech\
    \ recognition,\n   voice interfaces to services (such as airline information systems,\n\
    \   unified messaging) are becoming more prevalent.  In parallel, the\n   popularity\
    \ of mobile devices has also increased dramatically.\n   However, the voice codecs\
    \ typically employed in mobile devices were\n   designed to optimize audible voice\
    \ quality and not speech recognition\n   accuracy, and using these codecs with\
    \ speech recognizers can result\n   in poor recognition performance.  For systems\
    \ that can be accessed\n   from heterogeneous networks using multiple speech codecs,\
    \ recognition\n   system designers are further challenged to accommodate the\n\
    \   characteristics of these differences in a robust manner.  Channel\n   errors\
    \ and lost data packets in these networks result in further\n   degradation of\
    \ the speech signal.\n   In traditional systems as described above, the entire\
    \ speech\n   recognizer lies on the server.  It is forced to use incoming speech\n\
    \   in whatever condition it arrives after the network decodes the\n   vocoded\
    \ speech.  To address this problem, we use a distributed speech\n   recognition\
    \ (DSR) architecture.  In such a system, the remote device\n   acts as a thin\
    \ client, also known as the front-end, in communication\n   with a speech recognition\
    \ server, also called a speech engine.  The\n   remote device processes the speech,\
    \ compresses the data, and adds\n   error protection to the bitstream in a manner\
    \ optimal for speech\n   recognition.  The speech engine then uses this representation\n\
    \   directly, minimizing the signal processing necessary and benefiting\n   from\
    \ enhanced error concealment.\n   To achieve interoperability with different client\
    \ devices and speech\n   engines, a common format is needed.  Within the \"Aurora\"\
    \ DSR working\n   group of the European Telecommunications Standards Institute\
    \ (ETSI),\n   a payload has been defined and was published as a standard [ES201108]\n\
    \   in February 2000.\n   For voice dialogues between a caller and a voice service,\
    \ low latency\n   is a high priority along with accurate speech recognition. \
    \ While\n   jitter in the speech recognizer input is not particularly important,\n\
    \   many issues related to speech interaction over an IP-based connection\n  \
    \ are still relevant.  Therefore, it is desirable to use the DSR\n   payload in\
    \ an RTP-based session.\n"

  contents:
  - "2.1  ETSI ES 201 108 DSR Front-end Codec\n   The ETSI Standard ES 201 108 for\
    \ DSR [ES201108] defines a signal\n   processing front-end and compression scheme\
    \ for speech input to a\n   speech recognition system.  Some relevant characteristics\
    \ of this\n   ETSI DSR front-end codec are summarized below.\n   The coding algorithm,\
    \ a standard mel-cepstral technique common to\n   many speech recognition systems,\
    \ supports three raw sampling rates: 8\n   kHz, 11 kHz, and 16 kHz.  The mel-cepstral\
    \ calculation is a frame-\n   based scheme that produces an output vector every\
    \ 10 ms.\n   After calculation of the mel-cepstral representation, the\n   representation\
    \ is first quantized via split-vector quantization to\n   reduce the data rate\
    \ of the encoded stream.  Then, the quantized\n   vectors from two consecutive\
    \ frames are put into an FP, as described\n   in more detail in Section 4.1.\n"

  - "3.  ES 201 108 DSR RTP Payload Format\n   An ES 201 108 DSR RTP payload datagram\
    \ consists of a standard RTP\n   header [RFC3550] followed by a DSR payload. \
    \ The DSR payload itself\n   is formed by concatenating a series of ES 201 108\
    \ DSR FPs (defined in\n   Section 4).\n   FPs are always packed bit-contiguously\

- title: 3.1 Consideration on Number of FPs in Each RTP Packet
  contents:
  - "3.1 Consideration on Number of FPs in Each RTP Packet\n   The number of FPs per\
    \ payload packet should be determined by the\n   latency and bandwidth requirements\
    \ of the DSR application using this\n   payload format.  In particular, using\
    \ a smaller number of FPs per\n   payload packet in a session will result in lowered\
    \ bandwidth\n   efficiency due to the RTP/UDP/IP header overhead, while using\
    \ a\n   larger number of FPs per packet will cause longer end-to-end delay\n \
    \  and hence increased recognition latency.  Furthermore, carrying a\n   larger\
    \ number of FPs per packet will increase the possibility of\n   catastrophic packet\
    \ loss; the loss of a large number of consecutive\n   FPs is a situation most\
    \ speech recognizers have difficulty dealing\n   with.\n   It is therefore RECOMMENDED\
    \ that the number of FPs per DSR payload\n   packet be minimized, subject to meeting\
    \ the application's\n   requirements on network bandwidth efficiency.  RTP header\
    \ compression\n   techniques, such as those defined in [RFC2508] and [RFC3095],\
    \ should\n   be considered to improve network bandwidth efficiency.\n"
- title: 3.2 Support for Discontinuous Transmission
  contents:
  - "3.2 Support for Discontinuous Transmission\n   The DSR RTP payloads may be used\
    \ to support discontinuous\n   transmission (DTX) of speech, which allows that\
    \ DSR FPs are sent only\n   when speech has been detected at the terminal equipment.\n\
    \   In DTX a set of DSR frames coding an unbroken speech segment\n   transmitted\
    \ from the terminal to the server is called a transmission\n   segment.  A DSR\
    \ frame inside such a transmission segment can be\n   either a speech frame or\
    \ a non-speech frame, depending on the nature\n   of the section of the speech\
    \ signal it represents.\n   The end of a transmission segment is determined at\
    \ the sending end\n   equipment when the number of consecutive non-speech frames\
    \ exceeds a\n   pre-set threshold, called the hangover time.  A typical value\
    \ used\n   for the hangover time is 1.5 seconds.\n   After all FPs in a transmission\
    \ segment are sent, the front-end\n   SHOULD indicate the end of the current transmission\
    \ segment by\n   sending one or more Null FPs (defined in Section 4.2).\n"

    \   Therefore, each FP represents 20ms of original speech.  Note, as\n   shown\
    \ above, each FP MUST be padded with 4 zeros to the end in order\n   to make it\
    \ aligned to the 32-bit word boundary.  This makes the size\n   of an FP 96 bits,\
    \ or 12 octets.  Note, this padding is separate from\n   padding indicated by\
    \ the P bit in the RTP header.\n   The 4-bit CRC MUST be calculated using the\
    \ formula defined in 6.2.4\n   in [ES201108]. The definition of the indices and\
    \ the determination of\n   their value are also described in [ES201108].\n"
- title: 4.2 Format of Null FP
  contents:
  - "4.2 Format of Null FP\n   A Null FP for the ES 201 108 front-end codec is defined\
    \ by setting\n   the content of the first and second frame in the FP to null (i.e.,\n\
    \   filling the first 88 bits of the FP with 0's).  The 4-bit CRC MUST be\n  \
    \ calculated the same way as described in 6.2.4 in [ES201108], and 4\n   zeros\
    \ MUST be padded to the end of the Null FP to make it 32-bit word\n   aligned.\n"
- title: 4.3 RTP header usage
  contents:
  - "4.3 RTP header usage\n   The format of the RTP header is specified in [RFC3550].\
    \  This payload\n   format uses the fields of the header in a manner consistent\
    \ with that\n   specification.\n   The RTP timestamp corresponds to the sampling\
    \ instant of the first\n   sample encoded for the first FP in the packet.  The\
    \ timestamp clock\n   frequency is the same as the sampling frequency, so the\
    \ timestamp\n   unit is in samples.\n   As defined by ES 201 108 front-end codec,\
    \ the duration of one FP is\n   20 ms, corresponding to 160, 220, or 320 encoded\
    \ samples with\n   sampling rate of 8, 11, or 16 kHz being used at the front-end,\n\
    \   respectively. Thus, the timestamp is increased by 160, 220, or 320\n   for\
    \ each consecutive FP, respectively.\n   The DSR payload for ES 201 108 front-end\
    \ codes is always an integral\n   number of octets.  If additional padding is\
    \ required for some other\n   purpose, then the P bit in the RTP in the header\
    \ may be set and\n   padding appended as specified in [RFC3550].\n   The RTP header\
    \ marker bit (M) should be set following the general\n   rules defined in [RFC3551].\n\
    \   The assignment of an RTP payload type for this new packet format is\n   outside\
    \ the scope of this document, and will not be specified here.\n   It is expected\
    \ that the RTP profile under which this payload format\n   is being used will\
    \ assign a payload type for this encoding or specify\n   that the payload type\
    \ is to be bound dynamically.\n"
