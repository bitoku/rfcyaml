  - "1.  Introduction\n   Some applications need to discover the names of servers
    for a\n   specific resource.  Some common methods for server discovery are\n   insecure,
    e.g., queries for DNS [RFC1035] SRV resource records\n   [RFC2782] without using
    DNSSEC [RFC4033], and are subject to attacks\n   whereby a client can be re-directed
    to incorrect and possibly\n   malicious servers.  A client may even be re-directed
    to a server that\n   has credentials for itself and thus may authenticate itself
    to the\n   client, and yet it could be incorrect or malicious (because it has\n
    \  been compromised, say).\n   Domain-based names allow for GSS-API [RFC2743]
    initiator applications\n   (clients) to authorize acceptor principals (servers)
    to serve the\n   resource for which the client used insecure server discovery
    without\n   either securing the server discovery method or requiring an\n   additional
    protocol for server authorization.  That is, either a\n   discovered server has
    credentials for authenticating the domain-based\n   service names that it is intended
    to respond to, or it does not.\n   Availability of valid credentials for authenticating
    domain-based\n   names embodies the authorization of a given server to a domain-wide\n
    \  service.\n   A domain-based name consists of three required elements:\n   o
    \ a service name\n   o  a domain name\n   o  a hostname\n   The domain name and
    the hostname should be Domain Name System (DNS)\n   names, though domain-based
    names could be used in non-DNS\n   environments.  Because of the use of DNS names
    we must also provide\n   for internationalization of the GSS-API.\n   Note that
    domain-based naming isn't new.  According to a report to\n   the KITTEN WG mailing
    list, there exists at least one implementation\n   of LDAP which uses domain-based
    service naming, and the DIGEST-MD5\n   HTTP / Simple Authentication and Security
    Layer (SASL) mechanism\n   [RFC2831] describes a similar notion.  (See section
    2.1.2 of\n   [RFC2831] for a description of the \"serv-name\" field of the digest-\n
    \  response.)\n"

      to provide a method for constructing domain-wide\n   NFSv4 [RFC3530] filesystem
      namespaces where there is a single \"root\"\n   with one or more servers (replicas)
      and multiple filesystems glued\n   into the namespace through use of \"referrals\".
      \ Clients could then\n   construct a \"global\" namespace through use of the
      DNS domain\n   hierarchy.\n   Here, clients would always know, from context,
      when they need to find\n   the root servers for a given DNS domain.  Root server
      discovery would\n   be performed using DNS SRV RR lookups, without using DNSSEC
      where\n   DNSSEC has not been deployed.\n   When using RPCSEC_GSS [RFC2203]
      for security, NFSv4 clients would use\n   domain-based names to ensure that
      the servers named in the SRV RRs\n   are in fact authorized to be the NFSv4
      root servers for the target\n   domain.\n"

    - "6.2.  LDAP Server Discovery\n   LDAP clients using the GSS-API through SASL
      would also benefit from\n   use of domain-based names to protect server discovery
      through\n   insecure DNS SRV RR lookups, much as described above.\n   Unlike
      NFSv4 clients, not all LDAP clients always know from context\n   when they should
      use domain-based names.  That's because existing\n   clients may use host-based
      naming to authenticate servers discovered\n   through SRV RR lookups.  Changing
      such clients to use domain-based\n   naming when domain-based acceptor credentials
      have not been deployed\n   to LDAP servers, or when LDAP servers have not been
      modified to allow\n   use of domain-based naming, would break interoperability.
      \ That is,\n   there is a legacy server interoperability issue here.  Therefore,\n
      \  LDAP clients may require additional configuration at deployment time\n   to
      enable (or disable) use of domain-based naming.\n   Note: whether SASL [RFC4422]
      or its GSS-API bridges [RFC4752] [GS2]\n   require updates in order allow use
      of domain-based names is not\n   relevant to the theory of how domain-based
      naming would protect LDAP\n   clients' server discovery.\n"

  - "7.  Security Considerations\n   Use of GSS-API domain-based names may not be
    negotiable by some GSS-\n   API mechanisms, and some acceptors may not support
    GSS-API domain-\n   based names.  In such cases, the initiators are left to fall
    back on\n   the use of host-based names, so the initiators MUST also verify that\n
    \  the acceptor's host-based name is authorized to provide the given\n   service
    for the domain that the initiator had wanted.\n   The above security consideration
    also applies to all GSS-API\n   initiators who lack support for domain-based service
    names.\n   Note that, as with all service names, the mere existence of a domain-\n
    \  based service name conveys meaningful information that may be used by\n   initiators
    for making authorization decisions; therefore,\n   administrators of distributed
    authentication services should be aware\n   of the significance of the service
    names for which they create\n   acceptor credentials.\n"
