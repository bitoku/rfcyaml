  - "                 Announcement of NGG meeting-JULY 16-17\n   The proposed NGG\
    \ meeting date of 16-JULY-73 has been confirmed.  The\n   meeting will be held\
    \ at the University of Illinois on July 16 and 17.\n   An informal meeting will\
    \ be held Sunday evening, July 15, to arrange\n   the agenda.\n      The initial\
    \ meeting place will be:\n         Room 201, Advanced Computation Building\n \
    \        1101 W. Springfield\n         Urbana, Ill.\n   In the event that more\
    \ space is needed, subsequent meetings may take\n   place elsewhere.\n   James\
    \ Michener suggests that those attending be sure to have read his\n   RFC 493\
    \ on graphics protocols.\n   Local accommodations at Ramada Inn can be reserved\
    \ by calling\n   (800)648-5970(their tool-free number) or the local Inn, (217)352-\n\
    \   7891.  If you wish to make other arrangements, contact me and I will\n   try\
    \ to help.\n   Airline reservations can best be handled by your local airline\n\
    \   office.  Jim suggested that I warn Ozark (the local service) of the\n   upcoming\
    \ surge of non-student, non-standby passengers in the hopes of\n   getting better\
    \ service. As Ozark is currently enjoying a pilot\n   strike, I have been unable\
    \ to do this.  Hopefully, it will be over in\n   a few days, but if it isn't,\
    \ I recommend that you get the closest\n   flight you can and reserve a car for\
    \ the rest of the way. This\n   probably will be resolved in time to avoid any\
    \ hassle, but I thought\n   you would like to know about it just in case.\n  \
    \ So that I will have a rough idea how much space we will need, let me\n   know,\
    \ if possible, if you plan to attend.\n   I can usually be reached by calling\
    \ (217)333-9354, preferably in the\n   afternoon.  I will be gone July 2-6, so\
    \ during that period, Nancy\n   Freece at (217)333-7161 will take your messages.\
    \  Network mail will\n   be read earliest (also during JULY 2-6) if sent to user\
    \ BUNCH at site\n   USC-ISI.  My mailing address is:\n         Steve Bunch\n \
    \        Center for Advanced Computation, Room 208\n         University of Illinois\
    \ at Urbana-Champaign\n         Urbana, Ill. 61801\n            [ This RFC was\
    \ put into machine readable form for entry ]\n            [ into the online RFC\
    \ archives by Robbie Bennett  11/98 ]\n"
