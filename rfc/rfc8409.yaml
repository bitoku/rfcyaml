  - "1.  Introduction\n   This document describes a SAML attribute called the \"entity\
    \ category\n   attribute\".  Values of this attribute represent entity types or\n\
    \   categories.  When used with the SAML V2.0 Metadata Extension for\n   Entity\
    \ Attributes [SAML2MetadataAttr], each such entity category\n   attribute value\
    \ represents a claim that the entity thus labeled meets\n   the requirements of,\
    \ and is asserted to be a member of, the indicated\n   category.\n   These category\
    \ membership claims MAY be used by a relying party to\n   provision policy for\
    \ release of attributes from an identity provider,\n   to influence user interface\
    \ decisions such as those related to\n   identity provider discovery, or for any\
    \ other purpose.  In general,\n   the intended uses of any claim of membership\
    \ in a given category will\n   depend on the details of the category's definition\
    \ and will often be\n   included as part of that definition.\n   Entity category\
    \ attribute values are URIs.  Therefore, this document\n   does not specify a\
    \ controlled vocabulary for assigning such values;\n   they may be defined by\
    \ any appropriate authority without any\n   requirement for central registration.\
    \  It is anticipated that other\n   specifications may provide management and\
    \ discovery mechanisms for\n   entity category attribute values.\n   This document\
    \ also describes a SAML attribute called the \"entity\n   category support attribute\"\
    .  This attribute contains URI values that\n   represent claims that an entity\
    \ supports and/or interoperates with\n   entities in a given category or categories.\
    \  These values, defined in\n   conjunction with specific entity category attribute\
    \ values, provide\n   entities in a category with the means to identify peer entities\
    \ that\n   wish to interact with them in a fashion described by the category\n\
    \   specification.\n   This document does not specify any values for either the\
    \ entity\n   category attribute or the entity category support attribute.\n"

    \ that a category URI resolves to a human-\n   readable document defining the\
    \ category.\n   Authorities defining entity categories MUST produce a specification\n\
    \   of the entity category and SHOULD make arrangement for the category\n   URI\
    \ to resolve to the specification in human-readable form.\n   Authorities defining\
    \ entity categories MAY use versioning of category\n   URIs where appropriate;\
    \ if versioning is used, each version of the\n   specification of the entity category\
    \ SHOULD clearly indicate the\n   latest version of the category URI (and hence\
    \ of the specification).\n   The specification SHOULD include a description of\
    \ how the authority\n   defining the entity category implements governance for\
    \ the\n   specification if the specification is updated.\n   When used in SAML\

    \   The meaning of the entity category attribute is not defined by this\n   specification\

    \ of such a claim depend on the definition of the\n   category itself.\n   An\
    \ entity may be claimed to be a member of more than one category.\n   In this\
    \ case, the entity is claimed to meet the requirements of each\n   category independently\
    \ unless otherwise specified by the category\n   definitions themselves.\n   This\
    \ document intentionally does not define \"category\", in order to\n   leave the\
    \ concept as general as possible.  However, to be useful,\n   category definitions\
    \ SHOULD include the following as appropriate:\n   o  A definition of the authorities\
    \ who may validly assert membership\n      in the category.  While membership\
    \ in some categories may be self-\n      asserted informally by an entity's owner,\
    \ others may need to be\n      validated by third parties such as the entity's\
    \ home federation or\n      other registrar.\n   o  A set of criteria by which\
    \ an entity's membership in the category\n      can be objectively assessed.\n\
    \   o  A definition of the processes by which valid authorities may\n      determine\
    \ that an entity meets the category's membership criteria.\n   o  A description\
    \ of the anticipated uses for category membership by\n      relying parties.\n\

    \ of the entity category to different SAML role\n      descriptors and any protocol\
    \ support restrictions that may be\n      relevant.\n   Entity categories SHOULD\
    \ NOT be used to indicate the certification\n   status of an entity regarding\

    \ party.  It is for this reason that authorities defining\n   entity categories\

  - "6.  Security Considerations\n   The presence of the entity category attribute\
    \ within an entity's\n   entity attributes represents a series of claims (one\
    \ for each\n   attribute value) that the entity is a member of the named categories.\n\
    \   Before accepting and acting on such claims, any relying party needs\n   to\
    \ establish, at a level of assurance sufficient for the intended\n   use, a chain\
    \ of trust concluding that the claim is justified.\n   Some of the elements in\
    \ such a chain of trust might include:\n   o  The integrity of the metadata delivered\
    \ to the relying party, for\n      example, as assured by a digital signature.\n\
    \   o  If the entity category attribute is carried within a signed\n      assertion,\
    \ the assertion itself must be evaluated.\n   o  The policies and procedures of\
    \ the immediate source of the\n      metadata, in particular, any procedures the\
    \ immediate source has\n      with regard to aggregation of metadata from other\
    \ sources.\n   o  The policies and procedures implemented by agents along the\n\
    \      publication path from the original metadata registrar.  This may\n    \
    \  be determined by examination of the published procedures of each\n      agent\
    \ in turn or may be simplified if the entity metadata includes\n      publication\
    \ path metadata in mdrpi:PublicationPath elements as\n      described in Section\
    \ 2.3.1 of [SAML2MetadataRPI].\n   o  The policies and procedures implemented\
    \ by the original metadata\n      registrar.  The registrar's identity may be\
    \ known implicitly or\n      may be determined from the entity metadata if it\
    \ includes an\n      mdrpi:RegistrationInfo element and corresponding\n      @registrationAuthority\
    \ as described in Section 2.1.1 of\n      [SAML2MetadataRPI].\n   o  The definition\
    \ of the category itself, in particular, any\n      statements it makes about\
    \ whether membership of the category may\n      be self-asserted or may only be\
    \ asserted by particular\n      authorities.\n   Although entity category support\
    \ attribute values will often be\n   defined as self-asserted claims by the containing\
    \ entity, the\n   provenance of the metadata remains relevant to a relying party's\n\
    \   decision to accept a claim of support as legitimate, and the specific\n  \
    \ definition of a support claim will influence the assurance required\n   to act\
    \ on it.\n   The conclusion that a claim of category membership or support is\n\
    \   justified and should be acted upon may require a determination of the\n  \
    \ origin of the claim.  This may not be necessary if the immediate\n   source\
    \ of the metadata is trusted to such an extent that the trust\n   calculation\
    \ is essentially delegated to it.\n   In many cases, a claim will be included\
    \ in an entity's metadata by\n   the original metadata registrar on behalf of\
    \ the entity's owner, and\n   the mdrpi:RegistrationInfo element's @registrationAuthority\
    \ is\n   available to carry the registrar's identity.  However, any agent that\n\
    \   is part of the chain of custody between the original registrar and\n   the\
    \ final relying party may have added, removed, or transformed\n   claims according\
    \ to local policy.  For example, an agent charged with\n   redistributing metadata\
    \ may remove claims it regards as untrustworthy\n   or add others that were not\
    \ already present if they have value to its\n   intended audience.\n"
