  - "1.  Introduction\n   Early in 2004, the IESG undertook several experiments aimed\
    \ at\n   evaluating whether any of the proposed changes to the IETF document\n\
    \   flow process would yield qualitative improvements in document\n   throughput\
    \ and quality.  One such experiment, referred to as the\n   \"PROTO process\"\
    \ or \"PROTO\" (because it was created by the \"PROcess\n   and TOols\" or PROTO\
    \ [PROTO] team), is a set of methodologies designed\n   to involve working group\
    \ chairs or secretaries more directly in their\n   documents' approval life cycle.\
    \  In particular, the PROTO team\n   focused on improvements to the part of a\
    \ document's life cycle that\n   occurs after the working group and document editor\
    \ have forwarded it\n   to the IESG for publication.\n   By the end of 2004, the\
    \ IESG had evaluated the utility of the PROTO\n   methodologies based on data\
    \ obtained through several pilot projects\n   that had run throughout the year,\
    \ and subsequently decided to adopt\n   the PROTO process for all documents and\
    \ working groups.  This\n   document describes this process.\n   The methodologies\
    \ developed and piloted by the PROTO team focus on\n   the working group chair\
    \ or secretary as the primary Document\n   Shepherd.  The primary objective of\
    \ this document shepherding process\n   is to improve document-processing throughput\
    \ and document quality by\n   enabling a partnership between the Responsible Area\
    \ Director and the\n   Document Shepherd.  In particular, this partnership has\
    \ the explicit\n   goal of enfranchising the Document Shepherd while at the same\
    \ time\n   offloading a specific part of the follow-up work that has\n   traditionally\
    \ been responsibility of the Responsible Area Director.\n   The Responsible Area\
    \ Director has tens or many tens of documents to\n   follow, while the Document\
    \ Shepherd has only a few at a time.\n   Flowing the responsibility to the working\
    \ group level can ensure more\n   attention and more timely response.\n   Consequently,\
    \ the document shepherding process includes follow-up\n   work during all document-processing\
    \ stages after Working Group Last\n   Call, i.e., during AD Evaluation of a document,\
    \ during IESG\n   Evaluation, and during post-approval processing by IANA and\
    \ the RFC\n   Editor.  In these stages, it is the responsibility of the Document\n\
    \   Shepherd to track and follow up on feedback received on a document\n   from\
    \ all relevant parties.\n   The Document Shepherd is usually a chair of the working\
    \ group that\n   has produced the document.  In consultation with the Responsible\
    \ Area\n   Director, the chairs may instead decide to appoint the working group\n\
    \   secretary as the responsible Document Shepherd.\n"

- title: 3.  Process Description
  contents:
  - "3.  Process Description\n   The document shepherding process consists of the\
    \ following tasks:\n   o  Providing the Document Shepherd Write-Up accompanying\
    \ a document\n      that is forwarded to the IESG when publication is requested,\
    \ as\n      described in Section 3.1.\n   o  During AD Evaluation of the document\
    \ by the Responsible Area\n      Director, managing the discussion between the\
    \ editors, the working\n      group, and the Responsible Area Director, as described\
    \ in\n      Section 3.2.\n   o  During an IETF Last Call, if performed for the\
    \ shepherded\n      document, following up on community feedback and review comments.\n\
    \   o  During IESG Evaluation, following up on all IESG feedback\n      (\"DISCUSS\"\
    \ and \"COMMENT\" items) related to the shepherded\n      document, as described\
    \ in Section 3.3.\n   o  Following up on IANA and RFC Editor requests as described\
    \ in\n      Section 4 and Section 5.\n   The shepherd must keep the document moving\
    \ forward, communicating\n   about it with parties who review and comment on it.\
    \  The shepherd\n   must obtain the working group's consensus for any substantive\n\
    \   proposed changes.  The shepherd is the leader for the document and\n   for\
    \ the working group, and maintains a critical and technical\n   perspective. \
    \ In summary, the Document Shepherd continues to care for\n   a shepherded document\
    \ during its post-WG lifetime just as he or she\n   has done while responsible\
    \ for the document in the working group.\n   Before any document shepherding takes\
    \ place, a single Document\n   Shepherd MUST be identified for a document (he\
    \ or she will be named\n   in the Document Shepherd Write-Up).  Frequently, the\
    \ chairs and the\n   Responsible Area Director will decide that the working group\
    \ will\n   adopt the PROTO process for all their future documents.  After that\n\
    \   decision, the chairs, in consultation with the Responsible Area\n   Director,\
    \ decide on who should act as Document Shepherd for any given\n   document.  This\
    \ is typically and by default one of the chairs of the\n   working group.  In\
    \ consultation with the Responsible Area Director,\n   the chairs MAY also decide\
    \ to appoint the working group secretary as\n   Document Shepherd for a given\
    \ document.  The Document Shepherd SHOULD\n   NOT be an editor of the shepherded\
    \ document.\n   It is intended that the Document Shepherd role be filled by one\n\
    \   person during the entire shepherding process.  However, situations\n   may\
    \ occur when the Document Shepherd role may be reassigned to\n   different persons\
    \ during the lifetime of a document.  It is up to the\n   chairs and Responsible\
    \ Area Director to identify situations when this\n   may become necessary, and\
    \ then consult to appoint a new Document\n   Shepherd.\n   It is important to\
    \ note that the document shepherding process only\n   applies to documents that\
    \ are the product of a working group.  It\n   does not apply to documents that\
    \ originate elsewhere.  Additionally,\n   Section 6 discusses other instances\
    \ in which the document shepherding\n   process does not apply.\n"
- title: 3.1.  Document Shepherd Write-Up
  contents:
  - "3.1.  Document Shepherd Write-Up\n   When a working group decides that a document\
    \ is ready for submission\n   to the IESG for publication, it is the task of the\
    \ Document Shepherd\n   to complete a \"Document Shepherd Write-Up\" for the document.\n\
    \   There are two parts to this task.  First, the Document Shepherd\n   answers\
    \ questions (1.a) to (1.j) below to give the Responsible Area\n   Director insight\
    \ into the working group process that applied to this\n   document.  Note that\
    \ while these questions may appear redundant in\n   some cases, they are written\
    \ to elicit information that the\n   Responsible Area Director must be aware of\
    \ (to this end, pointers to\n   relevant entries in the WG archive are helpful).\
    \  The goal here is to\n   inform the Responsible Area Director about any issues\
    \ that may have\n   come up in IETF meetings, on the mailing list, or in private\n\
    \   communication that they should be aware of prior to IESG Evaluation\n   of\
    \ the shepherded document.  Any significant issues mentioned in the\n   questionnaire\
    \ will probably lead to a follow-up discussion with the\n   Responsible Area Director.\n\
    \   The second part of the task is to prepare the \"Document Announcement\n  \
    \ Write-Up\" that is input both to the ballot for the IESG telechat and\n   to\
    \ the eventual IETF-wide announcement message.  Item number (1.k)\n   describes\
    \ the elements of the Document Announcement Write-Up.\n   Some examples of Document\
    \ Announcement Write-Ups are included in\n   Appendix A, and there are many more\
    \ examples with subject lines such\n   as \"Protocol Action\" and \"Document Action\"\
    \ in the IETF-announce\n   mailing list archive.\n   The initial template for\
    \ the Document Shepherd Write-Up is included\n   below, but changes are expected\
    \ over time.  The latest version of\n   this template is available from the IESG\
    \ section of the IETF web\n   site.\n   (1.a)  Who is the Document Shepherd for\
    \ this document?  Has the\n          Document Shepherd personally reviewed this\
    \ version of the\n          document and, in particular, does he or she believe\
    \ this\n          version is ready for forwarding to the IESG for publication?\n\
    \   (1.b)  Has the document had adequate review both from key WG members\n   \
    \       and from key non-WG members?  Does the Document Shepherd have\n      \
    \    any concerns about the depth or breadth of the reviews that\n          have\
    \ been performed?\n   (1.c)  Does the Document Shepherd have concerns that the\
    \ document\n          needs more review from a particular or broader perspective,\n\
    \          e.g., security, operational complexity, someone familiar with\n   \
    \       AAA, internationalization, or XML?\n   (1.d)  Does the Document Shepherd\
    \ have any specific concerns or\n          issues with this document that the\
    \ Responsible Area Director\n          and/or the IESG should be aware of?  For\
    \ example, perhaps he\n          or she is uncomfortable with certain parts of\
    \ the document, or\n          has concerns whether there really is a need for\
    \ it.  In any\n          event, if the WG has discussed those issues and has indicated\n\
    \          that it still wishes to advance the document, detail those\n      \
    \    concerns here.  Has an IPR disclosure related to this document\n        \
    \  been filed?  If so, please include a reference to the\n          disclosure\
    \ and summarize the WG discussion and conclusion on\n          this issue.\n \
    \  (1.e)  How solid is the WG consensus behind this document?  Does it\n     \
    \     represent the strong concurrence of a few individuals, with\n          others\
    \ being silent, or does the WG as a whole understand and\n          agree with\
    \ it?\n   (1.f)  Has anyone threatened an appeal or otherwise indicated extreme\n\
    \          discontent?  If so, please summarize the areas of conflict in\n   \
    \       separate email messages to the Responsible Area Director.  (It\n     \
    \     should be in a separate email because this questionnaire is\n          entered\
    \ into the ID Tracker.)\n   (1.g)  Has the Document Shepherd personally verified\
    \ that the\n          document satisfies all ID nits?  (See\n          http://www.ietf.org/ID-Checklist.html\
    \ and\n          http://tools.ietf.org/tools/idnits/.)  Boilerplate checks are\n\
    \          not enough; this check needs to be thorough.  Has the document\n  \
    \        met all formal review criteria it needs to, such as the MIB\n       \
    \   Doctor, media type, and URI type reviews?  If the document\n          does\
    \ not already indicate its intended status at the top of\n          the first\
    \ page, please indicate the intended status here.\n   (1.h)  Has the document\
    \ split its references into normative and\n          informative?  Are there normative\
    \ references to documents that\n          are not ready for advancement or are\
    \ otherwise in an unclear\n          state?  If such normative references exist,\
    \ what is the\n          strategy for their completion?  Are there normative references\n\
    \          that are downward references, as described in [RFC3967]?  If\n    \
    \      so, list these downward references to support the Area\n          Director\
    \ in the Last Call procedure for them [RFC3967].\n   (1.i)  Has the Document Shepherd\
    \ verified that the document's IANA\n          Considerations section exists and\
    \ is consistent with the body\n          of the document?  If the document specifies\
    \ protocol\n          extensions, are reservations requested in appropriate IANA\n\
    \          registries?  Are the IANA registries clearly identified?  If\n    \
    \      the document creates a new registry, does it define the\n          proposed\
    \ initial contents of the registry and an allocation\n          procedure for\
    \ future registrations?  Does it suggest a\n          reasonable name for the\
    \ new registry?  See [RFC2434].  If the\n          document describes an Expert\
    \ Review process, has the Document\n          Shepherd conferred with the Responsible\
    \ Area Director so that\n          the IESG can appoint the needed Expert during\
    \ IESG Evaluation?\n   (1.j)  Has the Document Shepherd verified that sections\
    \ of the\n          document that are written in a formal language, such as XML\n\
    \          code, BNF rules, MIB definitions, etc., validate correctly in\n   \
    \       an automated checker?\n   (1.k)  The IESG approval announcement includes\
    \ a Document\n          Announcement Write-Up.  Please provide such a Document\n\
    \          Announcement Write-Up.  Recent examples can be found in the\n     \
    \     \"Action\" announcements for approved documents.  The approval\n       \
    \   announcement contains the following sections:\n          Technical Summary\n\
    \             Relevant content can frequently be found in the abstract\n     \
    \        and/or introduction of the document.  If not, this may be\n         \
    \    an indication that there are deficiencies in the abstract\n             or\
    \ introduction.\n          Working Group Summary\n             Was there anything\
    \ in the WG process that is worth noting?\n             For example, was there\
    \ controversy about particular points\n             or were there decisions where\
    \ the consensus was\n             particularly rough?\n          Document Quality\n\
    \             Are there existing implementations of the protocol?  Have a\n  \
    \           significant number of vendors indicated their plan to\n          \
    \   implement the specification?  Are there any reviewers that\n             merit\
    \ special mention as having done a thorough review,\n             e.g., one that\
    \ resulted in important changes or a\n             conclusion that the document\
    \ had no substantive issues?  If\n             there was a MIB Doctor, Media Type,\
    \ or other Expert Review,\n             what was its course (briefly)?  In the\
    \ case of a Media Type\n             Review, on what date was the request posted?\n\
    \          Personnel\n             Who is the Document Shepherd for this document?\
    \  Who is the\n             Responsible Area Director?  If the document requires\
    \ IANA\n             experts(s), insert 'The IANA Expert(s) for the registries\n\
    \             in this document are <TO BE ADDED BY THE AD>.'\n   The Document\
    \ Shepherd MUST send the Document Shepherd Write-Up to the\n   Responsible Area\
    \ Director and iesg-secretary@ietf.org together with\n   the request to publish\
    \ the document.  The Document Shepherd SHOULD\n   also send the entire Document\
    \ Shepherd Write-Up to the working group\n   mailing list.  If the Document Shepherd\
    \ feels that information which\n   may prove to be sensitive, may lead to possible\
    \ appeals, or is\n   personal needs to be written up, it SHOULD be sent in direct\
    \ email to\n   the Responsible Area Director, because the Document Shepherd Write-Up\n\
    \   is published openly in the ID Tracker.  Question (1.f) of the\n   Write-Up\
    \ covers any material of this nature and specifies this more\n   confidential\
    \ handling.\n   The Document Shepherd Write-Up is entered into the ID Tracker\n\
    \   [IDTRACKER] as a \"Comment\".  The name and email address of the\n   Document\
    \ Shepherd are entered into the ID Tracker, currently as a\n   \"Brief Note\"\
    \ (this may change in the future).  The email address of\n   the Document Shepherd\
    \ MUST also be added to the \"State or Version\n   Change Notice To\" field (typically\
    \ the email addresses of all working\n   group chairs, authors, and the secretary\
    \ will be added).\n   Entering the name and email of the Document Shepherd into\
    \ the ID\n   Tracker is REQUIRED to ensure that he or she will be copied on the\n\
    \   email exchange between the editors, chairs, the IESG, the IESG\n   secretariat,\
    \ IANA, and the RFC Editor during the review and approval\n   process.  There\
    \ are still manual steps required for these parties to\n   ensure that they include\
    \ the Document Shepherd, but it is hoped that\n   in the future, automated tools\
    \ will ensure that Document Shepherds\n   (and others) receive necessary communications.\n\
    \   The contact information for the Document Shepherd is also important\n   for\
    \ the Gen-ART team [GEN-ART], area directorates, and other review\n   teams, so\
    \ they can know to whom to address reviews, in addition to\n   the Responsible\
    \ Area Director.\n"

  - "3.2.  Document Shepherding during AD Evaluation\n   The steps for document shepherding\
    \ during AD Evaluation are as\n   follows:\n   (2.a)  The Responsible Area Director\
    \ reads, evaluates, and comments\n          on the document, as is the case when\
    \ not using the document\n          shepherding process.  If the Responsible Area\
    \ Director\n          determines that the document is ready for IESG Evaluation,\
    \ he\n          or she indicates this to the Document Shepherd and the\n     \
    \     document shepherding process continues as described in\n          Section\
    \ 3.3.\n   (2.b)  If the Responsible Area Director has identified issues with\
    \ a\n          document that must be addressed before IESG Evaluation can\n  \
    \        commence, he or she sends a full evaluation to the Document\n       \
    \   Shepherd and SHOULD also enter the review into the ID Tracker.\n   (2.c) \
    \ The Document Shepherd reads the AD Evaluation comments, making\n          very\
    \ certain that all comments are understood, so that it is\n          possible\
    \ to follow up on them with the editors and working\n          group.  If there\
    \ is some uncertainty as to what is requested,\n          this SHOULD be resolved\
    \ with the Responsible Area Director.\n   (2.d)  The Document Shepherd sends the\
    \ AD Evaluation comments to the\n          editors and to the working group mailing\
    \ list, in order to\n          have a permanent record of the comments.  It is\
    \ RECOMMENDED\n          that the Document Shepherd solicit from the editors an\n\
    \          estimate on when the required changes will be completed and a\n   \
    \       revised document can be expected.  Working groups that use\n         \
    \ issue tracking SHOULD also record the issues (and eventually\n          their\
    \ resolution) in their issue tracker.\n   (2.e)  During the production of a revised\
    \ document that addresses the\n          AD Evaluation comments, it is RECOMMENDED\
    \ that the editors\n          keep a list showing how each comment was addressed\
    \ and what\n          the revised text is.  It is RECOMMENDED that this list be\n\
    \          forwarded to the Responsible Area Director together with the\n    \
    \      revised document.\n   (2.f)  In the event that the editors or working group\
    \ disagrees with\n          a comment raised by the Responsible Area Director\
    \ or has\n          previously considered and dismissed the issue, the Document\n\
    \          Shepherd MUST resolve the issue with the Responsible Area\n       \
    \   Director before a revised document can be submitted.\n   (2.g)  The Document\

  - "3.3.  Document Shepherding during IESG Evaluation\n   During IESG Evaluation\
    \ of a document, ADs can bring forward two kinds\n   of remarks about a document:\
    \ DISCUSS items and COMMENT items.  A\n   DISCUSS blocks a document's approval\
    \ process until it has been\n   resolved; a COMMENT does not.  This section details\
    \ the steps that a\n   Document Shepherd takes to resolve any DISCUSS and COMMENT\
    \ items\n   brought forward against a shepherded document during IESG Evaluation.\n\
    \   Note that DISCUSS and COMMENT items are occasionally written in a\n   manner\
    \ that makes their intent unclear.  In these cases, the Document\n   Shepherd\
    \ SHOULD start a discussion with the ADs who brought the items\n   up to clarify\
    \ their intent, keeping the Responsible Area Director\n   informed.  If this fails\
    \ to clarify the intent, the Responsible Area\n   Director may need to work towards\
    \ a clarification inside the IESG.\n   (3.a)  Leading up to the IESG conference\
    \ call, the Document Shepherd\n          may see emails about the document from\
    \ directorate reviewers\n          on behalf of one or more ADs and also emailed\
    \ copies of\n          DISCUSS and COMMENT items entered into the ID Tracker.\
    \  The\n          Document Shepherd SHOULD immediately begin to work on\n    \
    \      resolving DISCUSS and COMMENT items with the ADs who have\n          raised\
    \ them, keeping the Responsible Area Director copied on\n          the email exchange,\
    \ so that he or she is able to support the\n          activity during the conference\
    \ call.  When dealing with\n          directorate reviews, the Document Shepherd\
    \ MUST involve the\n          ADs to whom these directorates report to ensure\
    \ that these ADs\n          consider the review comments that need resolving.\n\
    \   (3.b)  Immediately following the conference call, when the document\n    \
    \      changes state from the \"IESG Evaluation\" state to one of the\n      \
    \    states requiring Document Shepherd action, e.g., \"IESG\n          Evaluation:\
    \ Revised ID Needed\" or \"IESG Evaluation: AD\n          Followup\", the Document\
    \ Shepherd will receive email.  A state\n          of \"AD Followup\" typically\
    \ signifies the Responsible Area\n          Director's hope that a resolution\
    \ may be possible through a\n          continued discussion or (more usually)\
    \ through a small set of\n          changes as \"Notes to the RFC Editor\".\n\
    \          Note that there may be very exceptional cases when DISCUSS\n      \
    \    items are registered after an IESG conference call.  In these\n         \
    \ cases, the AD who has raised the DISCUSS MUST notify the\n          Document\
    \ Shepherd about it.  (The notification facility in the\n          ID Tracker\
    \ is very convenient for this purpose and also for\n          the cases where\
    \ the DISCUSS and COMMENT items are updated\n          after they are partially\
    \ resolved.)\n   (3.c)  The Document Shepherd then queries the ID Tracker to collect\n\
    \          the remaining DISCUSS and COMMENT items raised against the\n      \
    \    document.  The Document Shepherd analyzes these items and\n          initializes\
    \ contact with the ADs who have placed them.  The\n          Responsible Area\
    \ Director MUST be copied on all correspondence\n          related to active DISCUSS\
    \ or COMMENT items.  This does not\n          place the Responsible Area Director\
    \ in the critical path\n          towards a resolution, but should keep him or\
    \ her informed\n          about the state of the discussion.\n          +-------+\

    \ is similar to much\n          of the process described in Section 3.2.\n   \

    \ required\n              +--------------------------+\n   (3.e)  The Document\
    \ Shepherd then communicates the DISCUSS and\n          COMMENT items to the document\
    \ editors and the working group,\n          alerting them of any changes to the\
    \ document that have\n          accumulated during IESG processing, such as \"\
    Notes to the RFC\n          Editor\".  If any changes will be substantive, the\
    \ Document\n          Shepherd, in consultation with the Responsible Area Director,\n\
    \          as during other stages, MUST confirm working group consensus\n    \
    \      or sometimes even IETF consensus.\n   (3.f)  After the editors resolve\
    \ the DISCUSS and COMMENT items, the\n          Document Shepherd reviews the\
    \ resulting new version of the\n          document, which will be a revised document,\
    \ a set of \"Notes to\n          the RFC Editor\", or both, using his or her technical\
    \ expertise\n          to ensure that all raised DISCUSS and COMMENT issues have\
    \ been\n          resolved.\n          Note that the Document Shepherd MAY also\
    \ suggest resolutions\n          to DISCUSS and COMMENT items, enter them into\
    \ an issue\n          tracker, or perform other steps to streamline the resolution\n\
    \          of the evaluation comments.  It is very important to resolve\n    \
    \      the comments in a timely way, while the discussion is current\n       \
    \   for everyone involved.\n   (3.g)  When the Document Shepherd is satisfied\
    \ that the revised\n          document addresses the evaluation comments, he or\
    \ she\n          communicates the resolution to the Responsible Area Director\n\
    \          and the ADs that had raised the DISCUSS and COMMENT items.\n   (3.h)\
    \  Each AD who had raised a DISCUSS checks whether the\n          communicated\
    \ resolution addresses his or her items.  If it\n          does, the AD will clear\
    \ the DISCUSS.  If it does not, the AD\n          notifies the Document Shepherd\
    \ and adds information to the ID\n          Tracker explaining why the DISCUSS\
    \ was not resolved.  The\n          Document Shepherd informs the working group\
    \ accordingly.\n          (COMMENT items need not be checked and cleared, because\
    \ they\n          do not block the document, but ADs are encouraged to do so.)\n\
    \          If a DISCUSS was not resolved to the satisfaction of the AD\n     \
    \     that has raised it or the Responsible Area Director, two\n          possibilities\
    \ exist:\n          (a)  The process returns to step (3.d), or\n          (b)\
    \  If no progress can be made on the resolution of the\n               DISCUSS\
    \ with the AD who has raised it, despite repeated\n               clarifications\
    \ and discussions, the Responsible Area\n               Director should take over\
    \ continued shepherding of the\n               document.  Such a situation may\
    \ be indicative of larger\n               issues that the PROTO process was not\
    \ designed to handle.\n          Once the process above has cleared all DISCUSS\
    \ items, document\n          shepherding continues with step (3.i).\n   (3.i)\
    \  The Responsible Area Director moves the document to the\n          \"Approved\
    \ - Announcement to be sent\" state in the ID Tracker.\n          If he or she\
    \ deems the changes to the revised document\n          significant, there may\
    \ be a new WG Last Call, or possibly a\n          new IETF Last Call.  The document\
    \ goes through a new full IESG\n          Evaluation process if there is a new\
    \ IETF Last Call.\n"
- title: 4.  Shepherding the Document's IANA Actions
  contents:
  - "4.  Shepherding the Document's IANA Actions\n   IETF working group documents\
    \ often include considerations requiring\n   actions by the IANA, such as creating\
    \ a new registry or adding\n   information to an existing registry, perhaps after\
    \ consulting an\n   IESG-appointed Expert.  Sometimes the Document Shepherd must\
    \ keep\n   track of certain IANA actions to be completed by the IESG, such as\n\
    \   ratifying the appointment of a designated Expert called for in the\n   IANA\
    \ Considerations.  IANA-related processing may also include a\n   specified type\
    \ of Expert review, such as review of proposed MIME\n   media types on the designated\
    \ ietf-types mailing list.\n   The IANA reviews IETF documents and requests responses\
    \ at any or all\n   of the following times: in response to IETF Last Call, during\
    \ the\n   IESG Evaluation review of the document, and at the time when the IANA\n\
    \   performs actions in its web-based registry for the document, usually\n   but\
    \ not always after IESG approval of the document.  More details of\n   the IANA\
    \ process and IETF interaction are found in [RFC2434].\n   At the time of this\
    \ publication, RFC 2434 is under revision\n   [RFC2434bis], and the updates are\
    \ and will be of value to the\n   Document Shepherd.  Note that the Document Shepherd\
    \ MUST determine\n   (by individual review and consultation with others) what\
    \ is the most\n   recent and the most applicable IANA information and guidance\
    \ for his\n   or her document, be it the overall guidance, or external documents\
    \ in\n   his or her area, or in other areas.  An example of an external\n   document\
    \ is [RFC4020].\n   Whenever an IANA request comes, during whatever phase of the\n\
    \   shepherding process, the requester from IANA MUST ensure that the\n   Document\
    \ Shepherd and the Responsible Area Director both receive the\n   request.  The\
    \ Document Shepherd is responsible for responding as\n   rapidly as possible.\
    \  He or she should discuss requests that\n   introduce any possible concerns\
    \ with the working group.  The Document\n   Shepherd and the Responsible Area\
    \ Director may decide in consultation\n   that an IANA request leads to a change\
    \ that needs additional review\n   or approval.\n   In general, the Document Shepherd\
    \ ensures that the IANA process\n   completes, checks that the registry is correct\
    \ and that the IANA\n   Matrix (http://www.iana.org/numbers.html) is complete\
    \ and consistent,\n   and troubleshoots when all is not well.  At the end of IANA\n\
    \   processing, the Document Shepherd should be sure that the RFC Editor\n   has\
    \ acknowledged IANA conclusion, i.e., that the handoff has been\n   made.\n  \
    \ In summary, the task of shepherding the IANA actions is often\n   overlooked,\
    \ but is as important to coordinate and manage as all the\n   other document reviews\
    \ the Document Shepherd has managed.  As with\n   those, the Document Shepherd\
    \ contributes greatly to quality and\n   timeliness of the document by effective\
    \ and responsive shepherding of\n   the IANA requests.\n"

  - "5.  Document Shepherding after IESG Approval\n   After the IESG Evaluation and\
    \ resolution described in Section 3.3,\n   the IESG approves the document, and\
    \ the Responsible Area Director\n   uses the ID Tracker to ask for any final changes\
    \ to the Document\n   Announcement Write-Up and for it to be issued.  The Document\
    \ Shepherd\n   may have some edits for the Responsible Area Director, such as\
    \ minor\n   \"Notes to the RFC Editor\", and this is the time to consult and\n\
    \   provide them.\n   The IESG approval announcement goes to the general community\
    \ and to\n   the RFC Editor, and now the Document Shepherd (identified in the\n\
    \   Announcement Write-Up) continues to shepherd the document through its\n  \
    \ technical publication.  The RFC Editor currently makes a number of\n   types\
    \ of requests to the authors, Document Shepherd and Responsible\n   Area Director.\
    \  The Document Shepherd SHOULD lead in responding to\n   the RFC Editor and shepherd\
    \ the document during the post-approval\n   period to its publication.\n   The\
    \ RFC Editor request types include: editorial queries about\n   dangling or missing\
    \ informative and normative citations (good\n   shepherding should try to catch\
    \ these earlier, but they happen);\n   requests for the document source (e.g.,\
    \ XML or nroff); occasional\n   technical comments; and copy-edits for review\
    \ and close scrutiny by\n   the authors (AUTH48).  For the latter, the Document\
    \ Shepherd SHOULD\n   lead in checking that copy-edits have in no case affected\
    \ a consensus\n   wording of the working group that prepared the document, and\
    \ SHOULD\n   bring speed to this checking by multiple coauthors.  The Document\n\
    \   Shepherd also consults with the Responsible Area Director on\n   reviewing\
    \ proposed post-approval changes to the document by any\n   author.  These may\
    \ require Area Director approval, and they often\n   need to be presented to the\
    \ working group for consent if not a full\n   consensus procedure.\n   As in other\
    \ phases of document shepherding, the Document Shepherd\n   provides attentiveness\
    \ and timeliness by serving as the informed\n   representative of the document\
    \ and helping its advancement and its\n   integrity.\n"

  - "6.  When Not to Use the Document Shepherding Process\n   As mentioned in Section\

    \  If this cannot be avoided by\n   making another working group chair or secretary\
    \ the Document\n   Shepherd, the document shepherding process SHOULD NOT be used.\
    \  There\n   are several other cases in which the document shepherding process\n\
    \   SHOULD NOT be used.  These include:\n   1.  Cases where the Document Shepherd\
    \ is the primary author or editor\n       of a large percentage of the documents\
    \ produced by the working\n       group.\n   2.  Cases where the Responsible Area\

    \ (either due to\n       experience, strong views stated by the Document Shepherd,\
    \ or\n       other issues).\n   3.  Cases where the working group itself is either\
    \ very old, losing\n       energy, or winding down (i.e., cases where it would\
    \ not be\n       productive to initiate new processes or procedures).\n   Finally,\

    \   Technical Summary\n      These documents define the RTP Payload format for\
    \ MIDI (Musical\n      Instrument Digital Interface), and additional guidelines\
    \ on\n      implementation specifically concerning the timing of reception and\n\
    \      transmission for best performance in different applications.  MIDI\n  \
    \    is a real-time media, which however is brittle to losses and\n      errors.\
    \  Therefore the RTP payload format defines recovery\n      journals as a way\
    \ of avoiding persistent audible errors, and\n      discusses congestion control\
    \ handling for these journals.\n      The RTP payload for MIDI encodes the broad\
    \ range of MIDI commands.\n      The format is suitable for interactive applications\
    \ (such as\n      network musical performance) and content-delivery (such as file\n\
    \      streaming).\n   Working Group Summary\n      There is consensus in the\
    \ WG to publish these documents.\n   Document Quality\n      This RTP Payload\
    \ format has been implemented during the\n      development of the specification\

    \   Technical Summary\n      This document specifies the encapsulation of IPv6,\
    \ IPv4 and ARP\n      packets over Fibre Channel.  This document also specifies\
    \ the\n      methods for forming IPv6 link-local addresses and statelessly\n \
    \     autoconfigured IPv6 addresses on Fibre Channel networks, and a\n      mechanism\
    \ to perform IPv4 address resolution over Fibre Channel\n      networks.  This\
    \ document (when published as RFC) obsoletes RFC2625\n      and RFC3831.\n   Working\
    \ Group Summary\n      This document has been reviewed by Fibre Channel experts\
    \ in\n      Technical Committee T11 (Fibre Channel standards organization) in\n\
    \      addition to members of the IMSS WG.  There is solid support for\n     \
    \ this document both in the WG and from T11.\n   Document Quality\n      This\
    \ document replaces and consolidates two separate RFCs on IPv4\n      over Fibre\
    \ Channel (RFC 2625) and IPv6 over Fibre Channel (RFC\n      3831).  Most of its\
    \ technical content is unchanged from those\n      RFCs.  The technical changes\
    \ that have been made are primarily\n      based on implementation experience.\n\
    \   Personnel\n      The protocol has been reviewed for the IESG by David L. Black\
    \ (WG\n      chair).  Bert Wijnen has reviewed this document for the IESG.  In\n\
    \      addition, Brian Haberman has done a review for the INT Area as\n      requested\
    \ by WG-chair (David Black) via Margaret Wasserman.\n"
