  - "Abstract\n   This document defines a new Optional Parameter, called Capabilities,\n\
    \   that is expected to facilitate the introduction of new capabilities\n   in\
    \ the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) by providing graceful capability\n   advertisement\
    \ without requiring that BGP peering be terminated.\n   This document obsoletes\
    \ RFC 2842.\n"
- title: 1. Introduction
  contents:
  - "1. Introduction\n   Currently BGP-4 requires that when a BGP speaker receives\
    \ an OPEN\n   message with one or more unrecognized Optional Parameters, the\n\
    \   speaker must terminate BGP peering.  This complicates introduction of\n  \
    \ new capabilities in BGP.\n"

- title: 3. Overview of Operations
  contents:
  - "3. Overview of Operations\n   When a BGP speaker [BGP-4] that supports capabilities\
    \ advertisement\n   sends an OPEN message to its BGP peer, the message MAY include\
    \ an\n   Optional Parameter, called Capabilities.  The parameter lists the\n \
    \  capabilities supported by the speaker.\n   A BGP speaker determines the capabilities\
    \ supported by its peer by\n   examining the list of capabilities present in the\
    \ Capabilities\n   Optional Parameter carried by the OPEN message that the speaker\n\
    \   receives from the peer.\n   A BGP speaker that supports a particular capability\
    \ may use this\n   capability with its peer after the speaker determines (as described\n\
    \   above) that the peer supports this capability.\n   A BGP speaker determines\
    \ that its peer doesn't support capabilities\n   advertisement, if in response\
    \ to an OPEN message that carries the\n   Capabilities Optional Parameter, the\
    \ speaker receives a NOTIFICATION\n   message with the Error Subcode set to Unsupported\
    \ Optional Parameter.\n   In this case the speaker SHOULD attempt to re-establish\
    \ a BGP\n   connection with the peer without sending to the peer the Capabilities\n\
    \   Optional Parameter.\n   If a BGP speaker that supports a certain capability\
    \ determines that\n   its peer doesn't support this capability, the speaker MAY\
    \ send a\n   NOTIFICATION message to the peer, and terminate peering (see Section\n\
    \   \"Extensions to Error Handling\" for more details).  The Error Subcode\n \
    \  in the message is set to Unsupported Capability.  The message SHOULD\n   contain\
    \ the capability (capabilities) that causes the speaker to send\n   the message.\
    \  The decision to send the message and terminate peering\n   is local to the\
    \ speaker.  If terminated, such peering SHOULD NOT be\n   re-established automatically.\n"
- title: '4. Capabilities Optional Parameter (Parameter Type 2):'
  contents:
  - "4. Capabilities Optional Parameter (Parameter Type 2):\n   This is an Optional\
    \ Parameter that is used by a BGP speaker to convey\n   to its BGP peer the list\
    \ of capabilities supported by the speaker.\n   The parameter contains one or\
    \ more triples <Capability Code,\n   Capability Length, Capability Value>, where\
    \ each triple is encoded as\n   shown below:\n       +------------------------------+\n\
    \       | Capability Code (1 octet)    |\n       +------------------------------+\n\
    \       | Capability Length (1 octet)  |\n       +------------------------------+\n\
    \       | Capability Value (variable)  |\n       +------------------------------+\n\
    \   The use and meaning of these fields are as follows:\n      Capability Code:\n\
    \         Capability Code is a one octet field that unambiguously\n         identifies\
    \ individual capabilities.\n      Capability Length:\n         Capability Length\
    \ is a one octet field that contains the length\n         of the Capability Value\
    \ field in octets.\n      Capability Value:\n         Capability Value is a variable\
    \ length field that is interpreted\n         according to the value of the Capability\
    \ Code field.\n   BGP speakers SHOULD NOT include more than one instance of a\n\
    \   capability with the same Capability Code, Capability Length, and\n   Capability\
    \ Value.  Note however, that processing of multiple\n   instances of such capability\
    \ does not require special handling, as\n   additional instances do not change\
    \ the meaning of announced\n   capability.\n   BGP speakers MAY include more than\
    \ one instance of a capability (as\n   identified by the Capability Code) with\
    \ non-zero Capability Length\n   field, but with different Capability Value, and\
    \ either the same or\n   different Capability Length.  Processing of these capability\n\
    \   instances is specific to the Capability Code and MUST be described in\n  \
    \ the document introducing the new capability.\n"

  contents:
  - "5. Extensions to Error Handling\n   This document defines new Error Subcode -\
    \ Unsupported Capability.\n   The value of this Subcode is 7.  The Data field\
    \ in the NOTIFICATION\n   message SHOULD list the set of capabilities that cause\
    \ the speaker to\n   send the message.  Each such capability is encoded the same\
    \ way as it\n   would be encoded in the OPEN message.\n"
- title: 6. IANA Considerations
  contents:
  - "6. IANA Considerations\n   This document defines a Capability Optional Parameter\
    \ along with an\n   Capability Code field.  IANA maintains the registry for Capability\n\
    \   Code values.  Capability Code value 0 is reserved.  Capability Code\n   values\
    \ 1 through 63 are to be assigned by IANA using the \"IETF\n   Consensus\" policy\
    \ defined in RFC 2434.  Capability Code values 64\n   through 127 are to be assigned\
    \ by IANA, using the \"First Come First\n   Served\" policy defined in RFC 2434.\
    \  Capability Code values 128\n   through 255 are for \"Private Use\" as defined\
    \ in RFC 2434.\n"
