Abstract This specification is complementary to the GMPLS Ethernet Label Switching Architecture and Framework and describes the technology  specific aspects of GMPLS control for Provider Backbone Bridge Traffic Engineering (PBB TE).
The necessary GMPLS extensions and mechanisms are described to establish Ethernet PBB TE point to point (P2P) and point to multipoint (P2MP) connections.
This document supports, but does not modify, the standard IEEE data plane.
The IEEE 802.1 Provider Backbone Bridge Traffic Engineering (PBB TE) [IEEE802.1Qay]
standard supports the establishment of explicitly routed traffic engineered paths within Provider Backbone Bridged (PBB) networks.
PBB TE allows the disabling of: the Spanning Tree Protocol unknown destination address forwarding source address learning for administratively selected VLAN Identifiers.
With PBB TE an external provisioning system or control plane can be used to configure static entries in the managed objects of bridges and so establish traffic engineered paths in the network.
[RFC3945] is a family of control plane protocols designed to operate in connection oriented and traffic engineering transport networks.
GMPLS is applicable to a range of network technologies including L2SC networks (Layer 2 Switching Capable).
The purpose of this document is to specify extensions for a GMPLS based control plane to manage PBB TE explicitly routed traffic engineered paths.
This specification is complementary to the GMPLS Ethernet Label Switching Architecture and Framework document [RFC5828].
This document is the result of a large team of authors and contributors.

In addition to well understood GMPLS terms, this memo uses the following terminology from IEEE 802.1
DA  ESP Destination MAC Address ESP VID
A BEB comprised of both I  and B components
The PBB TE specification [IEEE802.1Qay] defines some additional terminology to clarify the PBB TE functions.
We repeat these here in expanded context to translate from IEEE to GMPLS terminology.
The terms "bridge" and "switch" are used interchangeably in this document.
The signaling extensions described here apply equally well to a PBB TE capable bridge supporting GMPLS signaling or to a GMPLS
capable switch supporting Ethernet PBB TE forwarding.
Ethernet Switched Path (ESP): A provisioned traffic engineered unidirectional connectivity path between two or more Customer Backbone Ports (CBPs) that extends over a Provider Backbone Bridge Network (PBBN).
The path is identified by the 3 tuple <ESP MAC DA, ESP MAC SA,
An ESP is point to point (P2P) or point to multipoint (P2MP).
An ESP is analogous to a (unidirectional) point to  point or point to multipoint LSP.
We use the term Ethernet LSP (Eth LSP) for
An ESP between two CBPs.
The ESP DA and the ESP SA in the ESP's 3 tuple identifier are the individual MAC addresses of the two CBPs.
An ESP among one root CBP and n leaf CBPs.
The ESP DA in the ESP's 3 tuple identifier is a group MAC address identifying the n leaf CBPs, and the ESP SA is the individual MAC address of the root.
Point to Point PBB TE Service Instance (P2P TESI):
A service instance supported by two point to point ESPs where the ESPs' endpoints have the same CBP MAC addresses.
The two unidirectional ESPs are forming a bidirectional service.
The PBB TE standard [IEEE802.1Qay] notes the following: for reasons relating to TE service monitoring diagnostics, operational simplicity, etc.,
the IEEE PBB TE standard assumes that the point to point ESPs associated with a point to point TESI are co routed.
Support for a point to point TE services that comprises non co routed ESPs is problematic, and is not defined in this standard.
Hence, a GMPLS bidirectional LSP is analogous to a P2P TE Service Instance.
We use the term "bidirectional Ethernet LSP" for GMPLS established P2P PBB TE Service Instances.

Creation and Maintenance of PBB TE Paths Using GMPLS
PBB TE is a connection oriented Ethernet technology.
PBB TE ESPs are created bridge by bridge (or switch by switch) by simple configuration of Ethernet forwarding entries.
This document describes the use of GMPLS as a valid control plane for the setup, teardown, protection, and recovery of ESPs and TESIs and specifies the required RSVP TE extensions for the control of PBB TE Service Instances.
PBB TE ESP and services are always originated and terminated on IB Backbone Edge Bridges (IB BEBs).
IB BEBs are constituted of I and B components, this is illustrated in Figure 1.
A B component refers to the structure and mechanisms that support the relaying of frames identified by Backbone VLANs in a Provider Backbone Bridge.
An I component refers to the structure and mechanisms that support the relaying of frames identified by service instances (I SIDs) in a Provider Backbone Bridge.
PBB and PBB TE relay frames with added I Component TAGs in the I component and VLAN TAGs in the B component.
PBB and PBB TE forward frames based on VLAN ID in the VLAN TAG (in the PBB case a B VID) until the destination MAC address is supported locally by a B component on this bridge indicating the destination has been reached.
At that point, the B VLAN tag is removed and processing or forwarding on the next TAG begins (in the PBB case an I Component TAG) until the I component identified by the I SID is reached.
At the I component, the I Component TAG is removed and the next Ethernet type identifies the TAG, etc.
An Ethernet service supported by a PBB TE TESI is always attached to a Customer Network Port (CNP) of the I component.
A Service Instance Identifier (I SID) is assigned for the service.
I SIDs are only looked at by source and destination (edge) bridges, so I SIDs are transparent to path operations and MAY be signaled.
The I  and B components have internal ports that are connected via an internal LAN.
These internal ports are the Provider Instance Ports (PIPs) and Customer Backbone Ports (CBPs).
PIPs and CBPs are not visible outside the IB BEB.
ESPs are always originated and terminated on CBP ports and use the MAC address of that port.
The I component encapsulates the service frames arriving from the CNP by adding an I SID and a complete Ethernet MAC header with an ESP MAC DA and ESP MAC SA.
The B component adds the ESP VID.
This document defines extensions to GMPLS to establish ESPs and TESIs.
As can be seen from the above, this requires configuration of both the I  and B components of the IB BEBs connected by the ESPs.
In the GMPLS control plane, TE Router IDs are used to identify the IB BEBs and Backbone Core Bridges (BCBs), and TE Links describe links connected to PNPs and CNPs.
TE Links are not associated with CBPs or PIPs.
Note that since multiple internal CBPs may exist, an IB BEB receiving a PATH message MUST be able to determine the appropriate CBP that is the termination point of the Eth LSP.
To this end, IB BEBs SHOULD advertise the CNP TE Links in the GMPLS control plane and RSVP TE signaling SHOULD use the CNP TE Links to identify the termination point of Eth LSPs.
An IB BEB receiving a PATH message specifying one of its CNPs can locally determine which CBPs have internal connectivity to the I component supporting the given CNP.
In the case that there is more than one suitable CBP,
and no I SID information is provided in the PATH message or previously in the associated Call setup, then the IB BEB can decide freely which CBP to assign to the requested connection.
On the other hand, if there is information on the service (I SID) that the given ESP will support, then the IB BEB MUST first determine which PIP and associated CBP is configured with the I SID and MUST assign that CBP to the ESP.
IB BEBs and GMPLS Identifiers Control
Ethernet/GMPLS Addressing and Label Space
PBB TE defines the tuple of <ESP MAC DA, ESP MAC SA, ESP VID> as a unique connection identifier in the data plane, but the forwarding operation only uses the ESP MAC DA and the ESP VID in each direction.
The ESP VID typically comes from a small number of VIDs dedicated to PBB TE.
ESP VIDs can be reused across ESPs.
There is no requirement that ESP VIDs for two ESPs that form a P2P TESI be the same.
When configuring an ESP with GMPLS, the ESP MAC DA and ESP VID are carried in a generalized label object and are assigned hop by hop, but are invariant within a domain.
This invariance is similar to GMPLS operation in transparent optical networks.
As is typical with other technologies controlled by GMPLS, the data plane receiver MUST accept, and usually assigns, labels from its available label pool.
This, together with the label invariance requirement mentioned above, result in each PBB TE Ethernet Label being a domain wide unique label, with a unique ESP VID   ESP MAC DA, for each direction.
The following illustrates PBB TE Ethernet Labels and ESPs for a P2P TESI.
Upstream PBB TE ESP 3 tuple
<ESP:MAC1, MAC2, VID1> (108 bits)
Downstream PBB TE ESP 3
tuple <ESP:MAC2, MAC1, VID2> (108 bits)
Table 1: Labels and ESPs 3.1.
Shared Forwarding One capability of a connectionless Ethernet data plane is to reuse destination forwarding entries for packets from any source within a VLAN to a destination.
When setting up P2P PBB TE connections for multiple sources sharing a common destination, this capability MAY be preserved provided certain requirements are met.
We refer to this capability as "shared forwarding".
Shared forwarding is invoked based on policy when conditions are met.
It is a local decision by label allocation at each end plus the path constraints.
Shared forwarding has no impact on the actual paths that are set up, but it allows the reduction of forwarding entries.
Shared forwarding paths are identical in function to independently routed paths that share a path from an intersecting bridge or link except they share a single forwarding entry.
The forwarding memory savings from shared forwarding can be quite dramatic in some topologies where a high degree of meshing is required; however, it is typically easier to achieve when the connectivity is known in advance.
Normally, the originating GMPLS switch will not have knowledge of the set of shared forwarding paths rooted on the source or destination switch.
Use of a Path Computation Element [RFC4655] or other planning style of tool with more complete knowledge of the network configuration is a way to impose pre selection of shared forwarding with multiple paths using a single forwarding entry and optimizing for both directions.
In this scenario, the originating bridge uses the LABEL SET and UPSTREAM LABEL objects to indicate the selection of the shared forwarding labels at both ends.
P2P Connections Procedures for Shared Forwarding
The ESP VID/ESP MAC DA can be considered to be a shared forwarding identifier or label consisting of some number of P2P connections distinctly identified by the <ESP MAC DA, ESP MAC SA, ESP VID> tuple.
This is analogous to an LDP label merge, but in the shared forwarding case, the ESP header contains sufficient information to identify the flow to which a packet belongs.
Resources can continue to be allocated per LSP with shared forwarding.
VLAN tagged Ethernet packets include priority marking.
Priority bits MAY be used to indicate Class of Service (COS) and drop priority.
Thus, traffic from multiple COSs could be multiplexed on the same Eth LSP (i.e., similar to E LSPs) and queuing and drop decisions are made based on the p bits.
This means that the queue selection can be done based on a per flow basis (i.e., Eth LSP   priority) and is decoupled from the actual steering of the packet at any given bridge.
A bridge terminating an Eth LSP will frequently have more than one suitable candidate for sharing a forwarding entry (common ESP VID/ESP MAC DA, unique ESP MAC SA).
It is a local decision of how this is performed but a good choice is a path that reduces the requirement for new forwarding entries by reusing common existing paths.
The concept of bandwidth management still applies equally well with shared forwarding.
P2P Ethernet LSPs PBB TE is designed to be bidirectional and symmetrically routed just like Ethernet.
That is, complete and proper functionality of Ethernet protocols is only guaranteed for bidirectional Eth LSPs.
In this section, we discuss the establishment of bidirectional Eth LSPs.
Note, however, that it is also possible to use RSVP TE to configure unidirectional ESPs, if the UPSTREAM LABEL is not included in the PATH message.
To initiate a bidirectional Eth LSP, the initiator of the PATH message MUST use the procedures outlined in [RFC3473] with the following specifics: 1) it MUST set the LSP encoding type to Ethernet (2)
2) it MUST set the LSP switching type to "802 1 PBB TE", value 40.
3) it SHOULD set the Generalized Payload Identifier (G PID) to Ethernet (33)
4) it MUST set the UPSTREAM LABEL to the ESP VID1/ESP MAC1 tuple where the ESP VID1 is administered locally for the local MAC address: MAC1.
5) it SHOULD set the LABEL SET or SUGGESTED LABEL if it chooses to influence the choice of ESP VID/ESP MAC DA.
6) it MAY carry an I SID via Call/Connection ID [RFC4974].
Intermediate and egress bridge processing is not modified by this document, i.e., is per [RFC3473].
However, as previously stated, intermediate bridges supporting the 802 1 PBB TE switching type MUST NOT modify LABEL values.
The ESP VID1/ESP MAC1 tuple contained in the UPSTREAM LABEL is used to create a static forwarding entry in the Filtering Database of bridges at each hop for the upstream direction.
This behavior is inferred from the switching type, which is 802 1 PBB TE.
The port derived from the RSVP HOP object and the ESP VID1 and ESP MAC1 included in the PBB TE Ethernet Label constitute the static entry.
At the destination, an ESP VID (ESP VID2) is allocated for the local MAC address:
MAC2, the ESP VID2/ESP MAC2 tuple is passed in the LABEL object in the RESV message.
As with the PATH message, intermediate bridge processing is per [RFC3473], and the LABEL object MUST be passed on unchanged, upstream.
The ESP VID2/ESP MAC2 tuple contained in the LABEL object is installed in the forwarding table as a static forwarding entry at each hop.
This creates a bidirectional Eth LSP as the PATH and RESV messages follow the same path.
P2P Path Maintenance Make before break procedures can be employed to modify the characteristics of a P2P Eth LSP.
As described in [RFC3209], the LSP ID in the sender template is updated as the new path is signaled.
The procedures (including those for shared forwarding) are identical to those employed in establishing a new LSP, with the extended tunnel ID in the signaling exchange ensuring that double booking of an associated resource does not occur.
Where individual paths in a protection group are modified, signaling procedures MAY be combined with Protection Switching (PS) coordination to administratively force PS operations
such that modification is only ever performed on the protection path.
PS is a native capability of PBB TE [IEEE802.1Qay] that can operate when two paths are set up between two common endpoints.
P2MP VID/Multicast MAC (MMAC) forwarding.
In this case, the PBB TE Ethernet Label consists of a VID and a Group MAC address.
The procedures outlined in [RFC3473] and [RFC4875]
could be adapted to signal P2MP LSPs for the source (point) to destination (multipoint) direction.
Each one of the branches of the P2MP Eth LSP would be associated with a reverse path symmetric and congruent P2P Eth LSP.
Complete procedures for signaling bidirectional P2MP
E LSPs are out of scope for this document.
The PBB TE Ethernet Label is a new generalized label with the following format:
This format MUST be used for both P2P and P2MP Eth LSPs.
For P2P Eth LSPs, the fields specify a VID and a unicast MAC address; whereas, for P2MP Eth LSPs, a VID and a group MAC address is carried in the label.
The PBB TE Ethernet Label is a domain wide unique label and MUST be passed unchanged at each hop.
This has similarity to the way in which a wavelength label is handled at an intermediate bridge that cannot perform wavelength conversion, and is described in [RFC3473].
Protection Paths When protection is used for path recovery, it is required to associate the working and protection paths into a protection group.
This is achieved as defined in [RFC4872] and [RFC4873] using the ASSOCIATION and PROTECTION objects.
The I SID is used to uniquely identify services within the network.
Unambiguous identification is achieved by ensuring global uniqueness of the I SIDs within the network or at least between any pair of edge bridges.
On IB BEBs, the Backbone Service Instance Table is used to configure the mapping between I SIDs and ESPs.
This configuration can be either manual or semi automated by signaling described here.
RSVP TE Signaling MAY be used to automate I SID to ESP mapping.
By relying on signaling, it is ensured that the same I SID is assigned to the service and mapped to the same ESP.
Note, by signaling the I
SID associated to the ESP, one can ensure that IB BEBs select the appropriate CBP port.
[RFC4974] MAY be used to create an association between the Eth LSP endpoints prior to establishment of the LSP.
The CALL ATTRIBUTES object can be used during CALL signaling, as described in [RFC4974], to indicate properties of the CALL.
The Service ID TLV, defined below, can be carried in the CALL ATTRIBUTES object to indicate the I SID to ESP mapping for the Eth LSP that will be set up in association with the CALL.
Alternatively, the GMPLS RSVP TE PATH message can carry the I SID association using the Service ID TLV in the LSP ATTRIBUTES object [RFC5420] at the time of Eth LSP signaling.
Using this mechanism, it is possible to create the I SID association, either when the path is set up or at a later time using a PATH refresh.
A new Service ID TLV is defined for the CALL ATTRIBUTES and LSP ATTRIBUTES objects.
The type value is 3 when carried in the CALL ATTRIBUTES object and the type value is 2 when carried in the LSP ATTRIBUTES object.
The format is depicted below.
SID Set Object: is used to define a list or range of I SIDs.
Multiple I SID Set Objects can be present.
SID Set Object MUST be present.
In most of the cases, a single I SID Set Object with a single I SID value is used.
The I SID Set Object is used to define a list or range of I SIDs.
When a range is defined, there are only two I SIDs that follow the beginning I SID and the end of the range
When list is defined, a number of I SIDs may be defined.
This indicates the length of the I SID Set object.
The I SID value identifies a particular backbone service instance.
The following errors identify Eth LSP specific problems.
In PBB TE, a set of ESP VIDs allocated to PBB TE must be configured.
Therefore, it is possible in some situations that the configuration of a bridge is not the same as other bridges.
If the ESP VIDs of various bridges have some ESP VIDs in common, it is possible some paths may be set up before encountering issues.
This is a management issue since all bridges should have the same ESP VID range.
The network operator administratively selects a set of VLAN Identifiers that can be used to set up ESPs.
Consequently, any VID outside the allocated range is invalid, and an error MUST be generated where the mismatch is discovered.
The Error indication is carried in the PathErr message from any intermediate bridge that does not support the signaled source VID or optionally the destination VID.
The Error MAY be indicated in the ResvErr if the allocation error happens on the RESV message.
In this case, a bridge that does not support the signaled destination VID MUST signal the error.
Invalid ESP VID Value in the PBB TE Ethernet Label
If a bridge is not configured to use the ESP VID value, carried in the Label object, for PBB TE ESPs, it MUST immediately generate an error: Routing problem (24) / Unacceptable label value (6).
Handling of this error is according to [RFC3209].
Note that an originating bridge can reuse an ESP VID with a different source or destination B MAC address.
By allocating a number of B MACs and a number of ESP VIDs, a large number of PBB TE connections may be supported.
Note, this error may be originated by any bridge along the path.
Allocated ESP VID Range is Exhausted
The destination bridge, after receiving the PATH message, has to assign a VID, which, together with its MAC address, will constitute the PBB TE Ethernet Label.
An existing VID may be reused when shared forwarding is used or when there are no path conflicts; otherwise, the bridge has to allocate a VID.
Depending on the size of the allocated VLAN range and the number of Eth LSPs terminated on a particular bridge, it is possible that the available VIDs are exhausted; hence, no PBB TE Ethernet Label can be allocated.
In this case, the destination bridge SHOULD generate a PathErr message with error code:
Routing problem (24) and error value:
MPLS Label allocation failure (9).
Invalid MAC Address IEEE defines a set of reserved MAC addresses from 01 80 C2 00 00 00 to 01 80 C2 00 00 0F as explained in [IEEE802.1Q] that have special meaning, processing, and follow specific forwarding rules.
These addresses cannot be used for PBB TE ESPs.
In the case the PBB TE Ethernet Label refers to such a MAC address, a bridge encountering the mismatch MUST immediately generate an error: Routing problem (24) / Unacceptable label value (6).
Handling of this error is according to [RFC3209].
This document does not introduce new security issues; the considerations in [RFC4872] and [RFC4873] apply.
A GMPLS controlled Ethernet PBB TE system assumes that users and devices attached to User to Network Interfaces (UNIs) may behave maliciously, negligently, or incorrectly.
Intra provider control traffic is trusted not to be malicious.
In general, these requirements are no different from the security requirements for operating any GMPLS network.
Access to the trusted network will only occur through the protocols defined for the UNI or Network to Network Interface (NNI) or through protected management interfaces.
When in band GMPLS signaling is used for the control plane, the security of the control plane and the data plane may affect each other.
When out of band GMPLS signaling is used for the control plane, the data plane security is decoupled from the control plane; therefore, the security of the data plane has less impact on overall security.
Where GMPLS is applied to the control of VLAN only, the commonly known techniques for mitigation of Ethernet denial of service (DoS) attacks may be required on UNI ports.
PBB TE has been designed to interwork with legacy VLANs and the VLANs provide isolation from Ethernet legacy control planes.
Where control plane communications are point to point over links that employ 802.1AE Media Access Control Security [MACSEC], it may reasonably be determined that no further security measures are used.
In other cases, it is appropriate to use control plane security where it is deemed necessary to secure the signaling messages.
GMPLS signaling security measures are described in [RFC3471] and [RFC3473], and they inherit security techniques applicable to RSVP TE, as described in [RFC3209] and [RFC2205].
For a fuller overview of GMPLS security techniques, see [RFC5920].
A new Switching Type, "802 1 PBB TE" (40), has been assigned in the Switching Types registry of the GMPLS Signaling Parameters registry.
The Service ID TLV has been assigned in the Attributes TLV Space in the RSVP TE Parameters registry.
It is carried in the LSP ATTRIBUTES object (class   197, C Type   1)
This new type has been registered as follows:
Service ID TLV Allowed on LSP ATTRIBUTES:
Yes Allowed on LSP REQUIRED ATTRIBUTES:
No The Service ID TLV has been assigned value 3 in the Call Attributes TLV registry in the RSVP Parameters registry.
It is carried in the CALL ATTRIBUTES object (class   202, C Type   1) defined by [RFC6001].
