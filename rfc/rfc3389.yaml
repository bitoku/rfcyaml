- title: 2. Introduction
  contents:
  - "2. Introduction\n   This document describes a RTP [1] payload format for transporting\n\
    \   comfort noise.  The payload format is based on Appendix II of ITU-T\n   Recommendation\
    \ G.711 [8] which defines a comfort noise payload format\n   (or bit-stream) for\
    \ ITU-T G.711 [2] use in packet-based multimedia\n   communication systems.  The\
    \ payload format is generic and may also be\n   used with other audio codecs without\
    \ built-in Discontinuous\n   Transmission (DTX) capability such as ITU-T Recommendations\
    \ G.726\n   [3], G.727 [4], G.728 [5], and G.722 [6].  The payload format\n  \
    \ provides a minimum interoperability specification for communication\n   of comfort\
    \ noise parameters.  The comfort noise analysis and\n   synthesis as well as the\
    \ Voice Activity Detection (VAD) and DTX\n   algorithms are unspecified and left\
    \ implementation-specific.\n   However, an example solution for G.711 has been\
    \ tested and is\n   described in the Appendix [8].  It uses the VAD and DTX of\
    \ G.729\n   Annex B [9] and a comfort noise generation algorithm (CNG) which is\n\
    \   provided in the Appendix for information.\n   The comfort noise payload, which\
    \ is also known as a Silence Insertion\n   Descriptor (SID) frame, consists of\
    \ a single octet description of the\n   noise level and MAY contain spectral information\
    \ in subsequent\n   octets.  An earlier version of the CN payload format consisting\
    \ only\n   of the noise level byte was defined in draft revisions of the RFC\n\
    \   1890.  The extended payload format defined in this document should be\n  \
    \ backward compatible with implementations of the earlier version\n   assuming\
    \ that only the first byte is interpreted and any additional\n   spectral information\
    \ bytes are ignored.\n"
- title: 3. CN Payload Definition
  contents:
  - "3. CN Payload Definition\n   The comfort noise payload consists of a description\
    \ of the noise\n   level and spectral information in the form of reflection coefficients\n\
    \   for an all-pole model of the noise.  The inclusion of spectral\n   information\
    \ is OPTIONAL and the model order (number of coefficients)\n   is left unspecified.\
    \  The encoder may choose an appropriate model\n   order based on such considerations\
    \ as quality, complexity, expected\n   environmental noise, and signal bandwidth.\
    \  The model order is not\n   explicitly transmitted since the number of coefficients\
    \ can be\n   derived from the length of the payload at the receiver.  The decoder\n\
    \   may reduce the model order by setting higher order reflection\n   coefficients\
    \ to zero if desired to reduce complexity or for other\n   reasons.\n"
- title: 3.1 Noise Level
  contents:
  - "3.1 Noise Level\n   The magnitude of the noise level is packed into the least\
    \ significant\n   bits of the noise-level byte with the most significant bit unused\
    \ and\n   always set to 0 as shown below in Figure 1.  The least significant\n\
    \   bit of the noise level magnitude is packed into the least significant\n  \
    \ bit of the byte.\n   The noise level is expressed in -dBov, with values from\
    \ 0 to 127\n   representing 0 to -127 dBov.  dBov is the level relative to the\n\
    \   overload of the system.  (Note: Representation relative to the\n   overload\
    \ point of a system is particularly useful for digital\n   implementations, since\
    \ one does not need to know the relative\n   calibration of the analog circuitry.)\
    \  For example, in the case of a\n   u-law system, the reference would be a square\
    \ wave with values +/-\n   8031, and this square wave represents 0dBov.  This\
    \ translates into\n   6.18dBm0.\n                        0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7\n   \

- title: 3.2 Spectral Information
  contents:
  - "3.2 Spectral Information\n   The spectral information is transmitted using reflection\
    \ coefficients\n   [8].  Each reflection coefficient can have values between -1\
    \ and 1\n   and is quantized uniformly using 8 bits.  The quantized value is\n\
    \   represented by the 8 bit index N, where N=0..,254, and index N=255 is\n  \
    \ reserved for future use.  Each index N is packed into a separate byte\n   with\
    \ the MSB first.  The quantized value of each reflection\n   coefficient, k_i,\
    \ can be obtained from its corresponding index using:\n        k_i(N_i) = 258*(N_i-127)\
    \     for N_i = 0...254; -1 < k_i < 1\n                   -------------\n    \

- title: 4. Usage of RTP
  contents:
  - "4. Usage of RTP\n   The RTP header for the comfort noise packet SHOULD be constructed\
    \ as\n   if the comfort noise were an independent codec.  Thus, the RTP\n   timestamp\
    \ designates the beginning of the comfort noise period.  When\n   this payload\
    \ format is used under the RTP profile specified in RFC\n   1890 [10], a static\
    \ payload type of 13 is assigned for RTP timestamp\n   clock rate of 8,000 Hz;\
    \ if other rates are needed, they MUST be\n   defined through dynamic payload\
    \ types.  The RTP packet SHOULD NOT\n   have the marker bit set.\n   Each RTP\
    \ packet containing comfort noise MUST contain exactly one CN\n   payload per\
    \ channel.  This is required since the CN payload has a\n   variable length. \
    \ If multiple audio channels are used, each channel\n   MUST use the same spectral\
    \ model order 'M'.\n"
- title: 5. Guidelines for Use
  contents:
  - "5. Guidelines for Use\n   An audio codec with DTX capabilities generally includes\
    \ VAD, DTX, and\n   CNG algorithms.  The job of the VAD is to discriminate between\
    \ active\n   and inactive voice segments in the input signal.  During inactive\n\
    \   voice segments, the role of the CNG is to sufficiently describe the\n   ambient\
    \ noise while minimizing the transmission rate.  A CN payload\n   (or SID frame)\
    \ containing a description of the noise is sent to the\n   receiver to drive the\
    \ CNG.  The DTX algorithm determines when a CN\n   payload is transmitted.  During\
    \ active voice segments, packets of the\n   voice codec are transmitted and indicated\
    \ in the RTP header by the\n   static or dynamic payload type for that codec.\
    \  At the beginning of\n   an inactive voice segment (silence period), a CN packet\
    \ is\n   transmitted in the same RTP stream and indicated by the CN payload\n\
    \   type.  The CN packet update rate is left implementation specific. For\n  \
    \ example, the CN packet may be sent periodically or only when there is\n   a\
    \ significant change in the background noise characteristics.  The\n   CNG algorithm\
    \ at the receiver uses the information in the CN payload\n   to update its noise\
    \ generation model and then produce an appropriate\n   amount of comfort noise.\n\
    \   The CN payload format provides a minimum interoperability\n   specification\
    \ for communication of comfort noise parameters.  The\n   comfort noise analysis\
    \ and synthesis as well as the VAD and DTX\n   algorithms are unspecified and\
    \ left implementation-specific.\n   However, an example solution for G.711 has\
    \ been tested and is\n   described in Appendix II of ITU-T Recommendation G.711\
    \ [8].  It uses\n   the VAD and DTX of G.729 Annex B [9] and a comfort noise generation\n\
    \   algorithm (CNG), which is provided in the Appendix for information.\n   Additional\
    \ guidelines for use such as the factors affecting system\n   performance in the\
    \ design of the VAD/DTX/CNG algorithms are described\n   in the Appendix.\n"
- title: 5.1 Usage of SDP
  contents:
  - "5.1 Usage of SDP\n   When using the Session Description Protocol (SDP) [11] to\
    \ specify RTP\n   payload information, the use of comfort noise is indicated by\
    \ the\n   inclusion of a payload type for CN on the media description line.\n\
    \   When using CN with the RTP/AVP profile [10] and a codec whose RTP\n   timestamp\
    \ clock rate is 8000 Hz, such as G.711 (PCMU, static payload\n   type 0), the\
    \ static payload type 13 for CN can be used:\n         m=audio 49230 RTP/AVP 0\
    \ 13\n   When using CN with a codec that has a different RTP timestamp clock\n\
    \   rate, a dynamic payload type mapping (rtpmap attribute) is required.\n   This\
    \ example shows CN used with the G.722.1 codec (see RFC 3047\n   [12]):\n    \
    \     m=audio 49230 RTP/AVP 101 102\n         a=rtpmap:101 G7221/16000\n     \
    \    a=fmtp:121 bitrate=24000\n         a=rtpmap:102 CN/16000\n   Omission of\
    \ a payload type for CN on the media description line\n   implies that this comfort\
    \ noise payload format will not be used, but\n   it does not imply that silence\
    \ will not be suppressed.  RTP allows\n   discontinuous transmission (silence\
    \ suppression) on any audio payload\n   format.  The receiver can detect silence\
    \ suppression on the first\n   packet received after the silence by observing\
    \ that the RTP timestamp\n   is not contiguous with the end of the interval covered\
    \ by the\n   previous packet even though the RTP sequence number has incremented\n\
    \   only by one.  The RTP marker bit is also normally set on such a\n   packet.\n"

    \ MIME type,\n   CN (audio/CN).  The payload format specified in this document\

- title: 7. Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "7. Security Considerations\n   RTP packets using the payload format defined in\
    \ this specification\n   are subject to the security considerations discussed\
    \ in the RTP\n   specification [1].  This implies that confidentiality of the\
    \ media\n   streams is achieved by encryption.  Because the payload format is\n\
    \   arranged end-to-end, encryption MAY be performed after encapsulation\n   so\
    \ there is no conflict between the two operations.\n   As this format transports\
    \ background noise, there are no significant\n   security, confidentiality, or\
    \ authentication concerns.\n"
