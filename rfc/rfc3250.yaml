    \ a brief scope and feature description is provided in this\n   section as background\

    \ details.\n"
- title: 3.1 TIFF-FX Scope
  contents:
  - "3.1 TIFF-FX Scope\n   This document defines a TIFF-based file format specification\
    \ for\n   enabling standardized messaging-based fax over the Internet.  It\n \
    \  specifies the TIFF fields and field values required for compatibility\n   with\
    \ the existing ITU-T Recommendations for Group 3 black-and-white,\n   grayscale\
    \ and color facsimile.  TIFF has historically been used for\n   handling fax image\
    \ files in applications such as store-and-forward\n   messaging.  Implementations\
    \ that support this file format\n   specification for import/export may elect\
    \ to support it as a native\n   format.  This document recommends a TIFF file\
    \ structure that is\n   compatible with low-memory and page-level streaming implementations.\n\
    \   Unless otherwise noted, the current TIFF specification [TIFF] and\n   selected\
    \ TIFF Technical Notes [TTN1, TTN2] are the primary references\n   for describing\
    \ TIFF and defining TIFF fields.  This document is the\n   primary reference for\
    \ defining TIFF field values for fax\n   applications.\n"
- title: 3.2 TIFF-FX Features
  contents:
  - "3.2 TIFF-FX Features\n   Some of the features of TIFF-FX are:\n      -  TIFF-FX\
    \ is capable of describing bilevel, grayscale, palette-\n         color, full-color\
    \ and mixed content image data.\n      -  TIFF-FX includes a number of compression\
    \ schemes that allow\n         developers to choose the best space or time tradeoff\
    \ for their\n         applications.\n      -  TIFF-FX is designed to be extensible\
    \ and to evolve gracefully\n         as new needs arise.\n"
- title: 4. MIME Definition
  contents:
  - "4. MIME Definition\n   This document defines the image/tiff-fx MIME sub-type\
    \ to refer to\n   TIFF-FX Profiles J, C, L and M encoded image data and any future\n\
    \   TIFF-FX extensions, or a subset.  The image/tiff-fx content type may\n   be\
    \ used when black-and-white image data is encoded using TIFF-FX\n   Profiles S\
    \ or F, or a subset.\n"
- title: 5. IANA Registration
  contents:
  - "5. IANA Registration\n   To: ietf-types@iana.org\n   Subject: Registration of\
    \ Standard MIME media type image/tiff-fx\n   MIME media type name: image\n   MIME\
    \ subtype name: tiff-fx\n   Required parameters: none\n   Optional parameters:\
    \ none\n   Encoding Considerations: This media type consists of binary\n   data.\
    \  The base64 encoding should be used on transports that\n   cannot accommodate\
    \ binary data directly.\n   Security considerations:\n      TIFF-FX utilizes a\
    \ structure which can store image data and\n      attributes of this image data.\
    \  The fields defined in the\n      TIFF-FX specification are of a descriptive\
    \ nature and provide\n      information that is useful to facilitate viewing and\n\
    \      rendering of images by a recipient.  As such, the fields\n      currently\
    \ defined in the TIFF-FX specification do not in\n      themselves create additional\
    \ security risks, since the\n      fields are not used to induce any particular\
    \ behavior by the\n      recipient application.\n      TIFF-FX has an extensible\
    \ structure, so that it is\n      theoretically possible that fields could be\
    \ defined in the\n      future which could be used to induce particular actions\
    \ on\n      the part of the recipient, thus presenting additional\n      security\
    \ risks, but this type of capability is not supported\n      in the referenced\
    \ TIFF-FX specification.  Indeed, the\n      definition of fields which would\
    \ include such processing\n      instructions is inconsistent with the goals and\
    \ spirit of the\n      TIFF-FX specification.\n   Interoperability considerations:\n\
    \      The ability of implementations to handle all the defined\n      applications\
    \ (or profiles within applications) of TIFF-FX may\n      not be ubiquitous. \
    \ As a result, implementations may decode\n      and attempt to display the encoded\
    \ TIFF-FX image data only to\n      determine that the image cannot be rendered.\n\
