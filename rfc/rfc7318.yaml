- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   This document introduces policy qualifiers in the certificate\n\
    \   policies extension of the RPKI resource certificates.  This document\n   updates\
    \ [RFC6487].\n   The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\"\
    , \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and\
    \ \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].\n"
- title: 2.  Update to RFC 6487
  contents:
  - "2.  Update to RFC 6487\n   [RFC6487] profiles certificates, certificate revocation\
    \ lists, and\n   certificate signing requests specified in [RFC5280] for use in\n\
    \   routing public key infrastructure.\n   [RFC5280] defines an extension to certificates\
    \ for the listing of\n   policy information (see Section 4.2.1.4).  [RFC6487]\
    \ states in\n   Section 4.8.9: \"This extension MUST be present and MUST be marked\n\
    \   critical.  It MUST include exactly one policy, as specified in the\n   RPKI\
    \ CP [RFC6484]\".  This references the CertPolicyId of the sequence\n   allowed\
    \ in PolicyInformation as defined by [RFC5280].\n   [RFC5280] also specifies that\
    \ PolicyInformation may optionally have a\n   sequence of PolicyQualifierInfo\
    \ objects.  [RFC6487] does not\n   specifically allow or disallow these PolicyQualifierInfo\
    \ objects,\n   although Section 4 also states: \"Unless specifically noted as\
    \ being\n   OPTIONAL, all the fields listed here MUST be present, and any other\n\
    \   fields MUST NOT appear in a conforming resource certificate.\"\n   Because\
    \ there is a need for some RPKI Certificate Authorities to\n   include policy\
    \ qualifiers in their certificates, this document\n   updates Section 4.8.9 of\
    \ [RFC6487] as follows:\n      OLD:\n         This extension MUST be present and\
    \ MUST be marked critical.  It\n         MUST include exactly one policy, as specified\
    \ in the RPKI\n         Certificate Policy (CP) [RFC6484].\n      NEW:\n     \
    \    This extension MUST be present and MUST be marked critical.  It\n       \
    \  MUST include exactly one policy, as specified in the RPKI CP\n         [RFC6484].\
    \  Exactly one policy qualifier MAY be included.  If a\n         policy qualifier\
    \ is included, the policyQualifierId MUST be the\n         Certification Practice\
    \ Statement (CPS) pointer qualifier type\n         (id-qt-cps).\n   As noted in\
    \ [RFC5280], Section 4.2.1.4: \"Optional qualifiers, which\n   MAY be present,\
    \ are not expected to change the definition of the\n   policy.\"  In this case,\
    \ any optional policy qualifier that MAY be\n   present in a resource certificate\
    \ MUST NOT change the definition of\n   the RPKI CP [RFC6484].\n"
- title: 3.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "3.  Security Considerations\n   The Security Considerations of [RFC6487] apply\
    \ to this document.\n   This document updates the RPKI certificate profile to\
    \ specify that\n   the certificate policies extension can include a policy qualifier,\n\
    \   which is a URI.  While dereferencing the URI is not required for\n   certificate\
    \ validation, doing so could provide a denial-of-service\n   (DoS) vector, where\
    \ the target host may be subjected to bogus work\n   dereferencing the URI.  However,\
    \ this specification, like [RFC5280],\n   places no processing requirements on\
    \ the URI included in the\n   qualifier.\n   As an update to [RFC6487], this document\
    \ broadens the class of\n   certificates that conform to the RPKI profile by explicitly\
    \ including\n   within the profile those certificates that contain a policy qualifier\n\
    \   as described here.  A relying party that performs a strict validation\n  \
    \ based on [RFC6487] and fails to support the updates described in this\n   document\
    \ would incorrectly invalidate RPKI objects that include the\n   changes in Section\
    \ 2.\n"

  contents:
  - "4.  Acknowledgments\n   Frank Hill and Adam Guyot helped define the scope of\
    \ the issue\n   covered by this document and identified and worked with RPKI\n\
    \   validator implementers to clarify the use of policy qualifiers in\n   resource\
    \ certificates.\n   Sean Turner provided significant text to this document regarding\
    \ the\n   processing of the CPS URI and limiting the scope of the allowable\n\
    \   content of the policy qualifier.\n"
