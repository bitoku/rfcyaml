  - "Abstract\n   Mobile IPv6 bootstrapping can be categorized into two primary\n\
    \   scenarios: the split scenario and the integrated scenario.  In the\n   split\
    \ scenario, the mobile node's mobility service is authorized by a\n   different\
    \ service authorizer than the network access authorizer.  In\n   the integrated\
    \ scenario, the mobile node's mobility service is\n   authorized by the same service\
    \ authorizer as the network access\n   service authorizer.  This document defines\
    \ a method for home agent\n   information discovery for the integrated scenario.\n"

  - "1.  Introduction and Scope\n   The Mobile IPv6 protocol [RFC6275] requires the\
    \ mobile node to have\n   the following information:\n   o  the Home Address (HoA),\n\
    \   o  the home agent address, and\n   o  the cryptographic materials for establishing\
    \ an IPsec security\n      association with the home agent.\n   The cryptographic\
    \ materials need to be established prior to\n   initiating the registration process.\
    \  The mechanism via which the\n   mobile node obtains this information is called\
    \ \"Mobile IPv6\n   bootstrapping\".  In order to allow a flexible deployment\
    \ model for\n   Mobile IPv6, it is desirable to define a bootstrapping mechanism\
    \ for\n   the mobile node to acquire these parameters dynamically.  [RFC4640]\n\
    \   describes the problem statement for Mobile IPv6 bootstrapping.  It\n   also\
    \ defines the bootstrapping scenarios based on the relationship\n   between the\
    \ entity that authenticates and authorizes the mobile node\n   for network access\
    \ (i.e., the Access Service Authorizer, ASA) and the\n   entity that authenticates\
    \ and authorizes the mobile node for mobility\n   service (i.e., the Mobility\
    \ Service Authorizer, MSA).  The scenario\n   in which the Access Service Authorizer\
    \ is not the Mobility Service\n   Authorizer is called the \"split\" scenario.\
    \  The bootstrapping\n   solution for the split scenario is defined in [RFC5026].\
    \  The\n   scenario in which the Access Service Authorizer is also the Mobility\n\
    \   Service Authorizer is called the \"integrated\" scenario.  This\n   document\
    \ defines a bootstrapping solution for the integrated\n   scenario.\n   [RFC5026]\
    \ identifies four different components of the bootstrapping\n   problem: home\
    \ agent address discovery, HoA assignment, IPsec Security\n   Association [RFC4301]\
    \ setup, and Authentication and Authorization\n   with the MSA.  This document\
    \ defines a mechanism for home agent\n   address discovery.  The other components\
    \ of bootstrapping are as per\n   [RFC5026].\n   In the integrated scenario, the\
    \ bootstrapping of the home agent\n   information can be achieved via DHCPv6.\
    \  This document defines the\n   MIPv6 bootstrapping procedures for the integrated\
    \ scenario.  It\n   enables home agent assignment in the integrated scenario by\
    \ utilizing\n   DHCP and Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA)\n\
    \   protocols.  The specification utilizes DHCP and AAA options and\n   attribute-value\
    \ pairs (AVPs) that are defined in [RFC6610] and\n   [RFC5447].  This document\
    \ specifies the interworking among Mobile\n   Node (MN), Network Access Server\
    \ (NAS), DHCP, and AAA entities for\n   the bootstrapping procedure in the integrated\
    \ scenario.\n"

  contents:
  - "2.  Terminology\n   The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\"\
    , \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and\
    \ \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].\n\
    \   General mobility terminology can be found in [RFC3753].  The\n   following\
    \ additional terms, as defined in [RFC4640], are used in this\n   document:\n\
    \   Access Service Authorizer (ASA): A network operator that\n   authenticates\
    \ a mobile node and establishes the mobile node's\n   authorization to receive\
    \ Internet service.\n   Access Service Provider (ASP): A network operator that\
    \ provides\n   direct IP packet forwarding to and from the mobile node.\n   Mobility\
    \ Service Authorizer (MSA): A service provider that authorizes\n   Mobile IPv6\
    \ service.\n   Mobility Service Provider (MSP): A service provider that provides\n\
    \   Mobile IPv6 service.  An MSP is called a \"home MSP\" when MSP == MSA.\n \
    \  In this document, the term MSP means a Mobility Service Provider that\n   has\
    \ a roaming relationship with the MSA but it is not the MSA.\n   Split Scenario:\
    \ A scenario where the mobility service and the network\n   access service are\
    \ authorized by different entities.\n   Integrated Scenario: A scenario where\
    \ the mobility service and the\n   network access service are authorized by the\
    \ same entity.\n"
- title: 3.  Assumptions and Conformance
  contents:
  - "3.  Assumptions and Conformance\n   The following assumptions are made in this\
    \ document:\n   (a)  MSA == ASA.\n   (b)  MSA and MSP have a roaming relationship.\n\
    \   (c)  DHCP relay and NAS are either co-located or there is a mechanism\n  \
    \      to transfer received AAA information from the NAS to the DHCP\n       \
    \ relay.\n           Note: If assignment of a home agent in the home MSP is not\n\
    \           required by a deployment, co-location of the NAS and the DHCP\n  \
    \         relay functions or a mechanism to transfer received AAA\n          \
    \ information from the NAS to the DHCP relay won't be\n           necessary. \
    \ In such a case, only the implementation of the\n           options and procedures\
    \ defined in [RFC6610] should suffice.\n   (d)  The NAS shall support MIPv6-specific\
    \ AAA attributes as specified\n        in [RFC5447].\n   (e)  The AAA server in\
    \ the home domain (AAAH) used for network access\n        authentication (ASA)\
    \ has access to the same database as the AAAH\n        used for the mobility service\
    \ authentication (MSA).\n   If home agent assignment is required only in the ASP\
    \ by the\n   deployment, a minimal implementation of this specification MAY only\n\
    \   support the delivery of information from the DHCP server to the DHCP\n   client\
    \ through [RFC6610].  However, if home agent assignment in the\n   MSP is required\
    \ by the deployment, an implementation conforming to\n   this specification SHALL\
    \ be able to transfer the information received\n   from the AAA server to the\
    \ NAS, and from the NAS to the DHCP relay\n   function.  This can be achieved\
    \ either by co-locating the NAS and the\n   DHCP relay functions or via an interface\
    \ between these functions.\n   The details of this interface are out of the scope\
    \ of this\n   specification.\n"

  contents:
  - "4.2.1.  Home Agent Allocation in the MSP\n   This section describes a scenario\
    \ where the home agent is allocated\n   in the mobile node's MSP network(s) that\
    \ is (are) not co-located with\n   the ASP.  In order to provide the mobile node\
    \ with information about\n   the assigned home agent, the AAAH conveys the assigned\
    \ home agent's\n   information to the NAS via a AAA protocol, e.g., [RFC5447].\n\
    \   Figure 2 shows the message sequence for home agent allocation.  In\n   the\
    \ scenario with HA in the MSP, the following details apply.\n   (1)  The mobile\
    \ node executes the network access authentication\n        procedure (e.g., IEEE\
    \ 802.11i/802.1X), and it interacts with the\n        NAS.  The NAS is in the\
    \ ASP, and it interacts with the AAAH,\n        which is in the ASA/MSA, to authenticate\
    \ the mobile node.  In\n        the process of authorizing the mobile node, the\
    \ AAAH verifies in\n        the AAA profile that the mobile node is allowed to\
    \ use the\n        Mobile IPv6 service.  The AAAH assigns a home agent in the\
    \ home\n        MSP, and it assigns one or more home agents in other authorized\n\
    \        MSPs and returns this information to the NAS.  The NAS may keep\n   \
    \     the received information for a configurable duration, or it may\n      \
    \  keep the information for as long as the MN is connected to the\n        NAS.\n\
    \   (2)  The mobile node sends a DHCPv6 Information-request message\n        [RFC3315]\
    \ to the All_DHCP_Relay_Agents_and_Servers multicast\n        address.  In this\
    \ message, the mobile node (DHCP client) SHALL\n        include the following:\n\
    \        *  the Option Code for the Visited Home Network Information\n       \
    \    option [RFC6610] in the OPTION_ORO.\n        *  Client Home Network ID FQDN\
    \ option identifying the MSP.\n        *  the OPTION_CLIENTID to identify itself\
    \ to the DHCP server\n   (3)  The relay agent intercepts the Information Request\
    \ from the\n        mobile node and forwards it to the DHCP server.  The relay\
    \ agent\n        also includes the received home agent information from the AAAH\n\
    \        in the Relay-Supplied Options option [RFC6610].  If a NAS\n        implementation\
    \ does not store the received information as long\n        as the MN's session\
    \ remains in the ASP, and if the MN delays\n        sending a DHCP request, the\
    \ NAS/DHCP relay does not include the\n        Relay-Supplied Options option in\
    \ the Relay Forward message.\n   (4)  The DHCP server:\n        *  identifies\
    \ the client by looking at the DHCP Unique\n           Identifier (DUID) for the\
    \ client in the OPTION_CLIENTID.\n        *  determines that the mobile node is\
    \ requesting home agent\n           information in the MSP by looking at the Home\
    \ Network ID FQDN\n           option.\n        *  determines that the home agent\
    \ is allocated by the AAAH by\n           looking at the Relay-Supplied Options\
    \ option.\n        *  extracts the allocated home agent information from the Relay-\n\
    \           Supplied Options option and includes it in the Identified\n      \
    \     Home Network Information option [RFC6610] in the Reply\n           Message.\
    \  If the requested information is not available in\n           the DHCP server,\
    \ it follows the behavior described in\n           [RFC6610].\n   (5)  The relay\
    \ agent relays the Reply Message from the DHCP server to\n        the mobile node.\

    \ node.  In\n        the process of authorizing the mobile node, the AAAH verifies\
    \ in\n        the AAA profile that the mobile node is allowed to use the\n   \
    \     Mobile IPv6 services.  The AAAH assigns a home agent in the home\n     \
    \   MSP, and it assigns one or more home agents in other authorized\n        MSPs\
    \ and returns this information to the NAS.  Note that the\n        AAAH is not\
    \ aware of the fact that the mobile node prefers a\n        home agent allocation\
    \ in the ASP.  Therefore, the assigned home\n        agent may not be used by\
    \ the mobile node.  This leaves the\n        location of the mobility anchor point\
    \ decision to the mobile\n        node.\n   (2)  The mobile node sends a DHCPv6\
    \ Information Request message\n        [RFC3315] to the All_DHCP_Relay_Agents_and_Servers\
    \ multicast\n        address.  In this message, the mobile node (DHCP client)\
    \ SHALL\n        include the following:\n        *  the Option Code for the Home\
    \ Network Identifier Option\n           [RFC6610] in the OPTION_ORO.\n       \
    \ *  the OPTION_CLIENTID to identify itself to the DHCP server.\n   (3)  The relay\
    \ agent (which is the NAS) intercepts the Information\n        Request from the\
    \ mobile node and forwards it to the DHCP server.\n        The relay agent also\
    \ includes the received AAA AVP from the AAAH\n        in the Relay-Supplied Options\
    \ option [RFC6610].\n   (4)  The DHCP server identifies the client by looking\
    \ at the DUID for\n        the client in the OPTION_CLIENTID.  The DHCP server\
    \ also\n        determines that the mobile node is requesting home agent\n   \
    \     information in the ASP by looking at the Visited Home Network\n        Information\
    \ option.  If configured to do so, the DHCP server\n        allocates a home agent\
    \ from its configured list of home agents\n        and includes it in the Visited\
    \ Home Network Information Option\n        [RFC6610] in the Reply Message.  Note\
    \ that in this case, the\n        DHCP server does not use the received information\
    \ in the Relay-\n        Supplied Options option.\n   (5)  The relay agent relays\
    \ the Reply Message from the DHCP server to\n        the mobile node.  At this\
    \ point, the mobile node has the home\n        agent information that it requested.\n"

  - "4.3.  Bootstrapping Message Sequence: Fallback Case\n   In the fallback case,\
    \ the mobile node is not able to acquire the home\n   agent information via DHCPv6.\
    \  The mobile node MAY perform DNS\n   queries to discover the home agent address\
    \ as defined in [RFC5026].\n   To perform DNS-based home agent discovery, the\
    \ mobile node needs to\n   know the DNS server address.  The details of how the\
    \ MN is configured\n   with the DNS server address are outside the scope of this\
    \ document.\n"
