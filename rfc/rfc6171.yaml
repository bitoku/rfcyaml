  - "Abstract\n   This document defines the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol\n\
    \   (LDAP) Don't Use Copy control extension, which allows a client to\n   specify\
    \ that copied information should not be used in providing\n   service.  This control\

  contents:
  - "1.  Background and Intended Usage\n   This document defines the Lightweight Directory\
    \ Access Protocol\n   (LDAP) [RFC4510] Don't Use Copy control extension.  The\
    \ control may\n   be attached to request messages to indicate that copied (replicated\n\
    \   or cached) information [X.500] is not be used in providing service.\n   This\
    \ control is based upon the X.511 [X.511] dontUseCopy service\n   control option.\n\
    \   The Don't Use Copy control is intended to be used where the client\n   requires\
    \ the service be provided using original (master) information\n   [X.500].  In\
    \ absence of this control, the server is free to make use\n   of copied (i.e.,\
    \ non-authoritative) information in providing the\n   requested service.\n   For\
    \ instance, a client might desire to have an authoritative answer\n   to a question\
    \ of whether or not a particular user is a member of a\n   group.  To ask this\
    \ question of a server, the client might issue a\n   compare request [RFC4511],\
    \ with the Don't Use Copy control, where the\n   entry parameter is the Distinguished\
    \ Name (DN) of the group, the\n   ava.attributeDesc is 'member', and the ava.assertionValue\
    \ is the DN\n   of the user in question.  If the server has access to the original\n\
    \   (master) information directly or through chaining, it performs the\n   operation\
    \ against the original (master) information and returns\n   compareTrue or compareFalse\
    \ (or an error).  If the server does not\n   have access to the original information,\
    \ the server is obligated to\n   either return a referral or an error.\n   It\
    \ is not intended that this control be used generally (e.g., for all\n   LDAP\
    \ interrogation operations) but only as required to ensure proper\n   directory\
    \ application behavior.  In general, directory applications\n   ought to designed\
    \ to use copied information well.\n"
- title: 2.  Terminology
  contents:
  - "2.  Terminology\n   DSA stands for Directory System Agent (or server).\n   DSE\
    \ stands for DSA-Specific Entry.\n   The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"\
    REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\"\
    , \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n   document are to be interpreted as described\
    \ in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].\n"
- title: 3.  The Don't Use Copy Control
  contents:
  - "3.  The Don't Use Copy Control\n   The Don't Use Copy control is an LDAP Control\
    \ [RFC4511] whose\n   controlType is 1.3.6.1.1.22 and controlValue is absent.\
    \  The\n   criticality MUST be TRUE.  There is no corresponding response\n   control.\n\
    \   The control is appropriate for LDAP interrogation operations,\n   including\
    \ Compare and Search operations [RFC4511].  It is\n   inappropriate for all other\
    \ operations, including Abandon, Bind,\n   Delete, Modify, ModifyDN, StartTLS,\
    \ and Unbind operations [RFC4511].\n   When the control is attached to an LDAP\
    \ request, the requested\n   operation MUST NOT be performed on copied information.\
    \  That is, the\n   requested operation MUST be performed on original information.\n\
    \   If original (master) information for the target or base object of the\n  \
    \ operation is not available (either locally or through chaining), the\n   server\
    \ MUST either return a referral directing the client to a server\n   believed\
    \ to be better able to service the request or return an\n   appropriate result\
    \ code (e.g., unwillingToPerform).\n   It is noted that a referral, if returned,\
    \ is not necessarily to the\n   server holding the original (master) information.\
    \  It is also noted\n   that an authoritative answer to the question might not\
    \ be available\n   to the client for any number of reasons.\n   Where the client\
    \ chases a referral to a server (as referenced by an\n   LDAP URL) in the server\
    \ response in order to obtain an authoritative\n   response, the client MUST provide\
    \ the dontUseCopy control with the\n   interrogation request it makes to the referred\
    \ to server.  While LDAP\n   allows return of other kinds of URIs, the syntax\
    \ and semantics of\n   other kinds of URIs are left to future specifications.\
    \  The\n    particulars of how to act upon other kinds of URIs are also left to\n\
    \   future specifications.\n   Servers implementing this technical specification\
    \ SHOULD publish the\n   object identifier 1.3.6.1.1.22 as a value of the 'supportedControl'\n\
    \   attribute [RFC4512] in their root DSE.  A server MAY choose to\n   advertise\
    \ this extension only when the client is authorized to use\n   it.\n"
- title: 4.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "4.  Security Considerations\n   This control is intended to be provided where\
    \ providing service using\n   copied information might lead to unexpected application\
    \ behavior.\n   Use of the Don't Use Copy control may permit an attacker to perform\n\
    \   or amplify a denial-of-service attack by causing additional server\n   resources\
    \ to be employed, such as when the server chooses to chain\n   the request instead\
    \ of returning a referral.  Servers capable of such\n   chaining can mitigate\
    \ this threat by limiting chaining to a\n   particular group of authenticated\
    \ entities.\n   LDAP is frequently used for storage and distribution of security-\n\
    \   sensitive information, including access control and security policy\n   information.\
    \  Failure to use the Don't Use Copy control may thus\n   permit an attacker to\
    \ gain unauthorized access by allowing reliance\n   on stale data.\n"
