- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   This document specifies a syntax and semantics for Elliptic\
    \ Curve\n   (EC) private key information.  EC private key information includes\
    \ a\n   private key and parameters.  Additionally, it may include the\n   corresponding\
    \ public key.  The syntax and semantics defined herein\n   are based on similar\
    \ syntax and semantics defined by the Standards\n   for Efficient Cryptography\
    \ Group (SECG) [SECG1].\n   Most Public Key Infrastructures (PKIs) mandate local\
    \ key generation;\n   however, there are some PKIs that also support centralized\
    \ key\n   generation (e.g., the public-private key pair is generated by a\n  \
    \ Certification Authority).  The structure defined in this document\n   allows\
    \ the entity that generates the private and public keys to\n   distribute the\
    \ key pair and the associated domain parameters.\n   This syntax is useful when\
    \ distributing EC private keys using\n   PrivateKeyInfo, as defined in PKCS #8\
    \ [RFC5208].  Distributing an EC\n   private key with PKCS#8 [RFC5208] involves\
    \ including:\n   a) id-ecPublicKey, id-ecDH, or id-ecMQV (from [RFC5480]) with\
    \ the\n      namedCurve as the parameters in the privateKeyAlgorithm field; and\n\
    \   b) ECPrivateKey in the PrivateKey field, which is an OCTET STRING.\n   When\
    \ an EC public key is included in the distributed PrivateKeyInfo,\n   the publicKey\
    \ field in ECPrivateKey is used.\n"

- title: 3.  Elliptic Curve Private Key Format
  contents:
  - "3.  Elliptic Curve Private Key Format\n   This section gives the syntax for an\
    \ EC private key.\n   Computationally, an EC private key is an unsigned integer,\
    \ but for\n   representation, EC private key information SHALL have ASN.1 type\n\
    \   ECPrivateKey:\n   ECPrivateKey ::= SEQUENCE {\n     version        INTEGER\
    \ { ecPrivkeyVer1(1) } (ecPrivkeyVer1),\n     privateKey     OCTET STRING,\n \
    \    parameters [0] ECParameters {{ NamedCurve }} OPTIONAL,\n     publicKey  [1]\
    \ BIT STRING OPTIONAL\n   }\n   The fields of type ECPrivateKey have the following\
    \ meanings:\n   o  version specifies the syntax version number of the elliptic\
    \ curve\n      private key structure.  For this version of the document, it SHALL\n\
    \      be set to ecPrivkeyVer1, which is of type INTEGER and whose value\n   \
    \   is one (1).\n   o  privateKey is the private key.  It is an octet string of\
    \ length\n      ceiling (log2(n)/8) (where n is the order of the curve) obtained\n\
    \      from the unsigned integer via the Integer-to-Octet-String-\n      Primitive\
    \ (I2OSP) defined in [RFC3447].\n   o  parameters specifies the elliptic curve\
    \ domain parameters\n      associated to the private key.  The type ECParameters\
    \ is discussed\n      in [RFC5480].  As specified in [RFC5480], only the namedCurve\n\
    \      CHOICE is permitted.  namedCurve is an object identifier that\n      fully\
    \ identifies the required values for a particular set of\n      elliptic curve\
    \ domain parameters.  Though the ASN.1 indicates that\n      the parameters field\
    \ is OPTIONAL, implementations that conform to\n      this document MUST always\
    \ include the parameters field.\n   o  publicKey contains the elliptic curve public\
    \ key associated with\n      the private key in question.  The format of the public\
    \ key is\n      specified in Section 2.2 of [RFC5480].  Though the ASN.1 indicates\n\
    \      publicKey is OPTIONAL, implementations that conform to this\n      document\
    \ SHOULD always include the publicKey field.  The publicKey\n      field can be\
    \ omitted when the public key has been distributed via\n      another mechanism,\
    \ which is beyond the scope of this document.\n      Given the private key and\
    \ the parameters, the public key can\n      always be recomputed; this field exists\
    \ as a convenience to the\n      consumer.\n"
- title: 4.  Other Considerations
  contents:
  - "4.  Other Considerations\n   When generating a transfer encoding, generators\
    \ SHOULD use\n   Distinguished Encoding Rules (DER) [X.690] and receivers SHOULD\
    \ be\n   prepared to handle Basic Encoding Rules (BER) [X.690] and DER\n   [X.690].\n\
    \   Section 1 described a format for transporting EC private keys (i.e.,\n   converting\
    \ ECPrivateKey to PrivateKeyInfo [PKCS#8]); however, this\n   format can also\
    \ be used for local storage.\n   Local storage of an unencrypted ECPrivateKey\
    \ object is out of scope\n   of this document.  However, one popular format uses\
    \ the .pem file\n   extension.  It is the PEM encoding, which is the Base64 encoding\
    \ (see\n   Section 4 of [RFC4648]), of the DER-encoded ECPrivateKey object that\n\
    \   is sandwiched between:\n   -----BEGIN EC PRIVATE KEY-----\n   -----END EC\
    \ PRIVATE KEY-----\n   Another local storage format uses the .der file extension.\
    \  In this\n   case, it is a DER [X.690] encoding of the ECPrivateKey object.\n\
    \   Local storage of an encrypted ECPrivateKey object is out of scope of\n   this\
    \ document.  However, ECPrivateKey should be the format for the\n   plaintext\
    \ key being encrypted.  DER [X.690] encoding the ECPrivateKey\n   will promote\
    \ interoperability if the key is encrypted for transport\n   to another party.\
    \  PEM encoding the DER-encoded ECPrivateKey is\n   common; \"Proc-Type:\" and\
    \ \"DEK-INFO:\" fields [RFC1421] followed by the\n   DER-encoded ECPrivateKey\
    \ are sandwiched between:\n   -----BEGIN EC PRIVATE KEY-----\n   -----END EC PRIVATE\
    \ KEY-----\n"
- title: 5.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "5.  Security Considerations\n   This structure does not protect the EC private\
    \ key information in any\n   way.  This structure should be combined with a security\
    \ protocol to\n   protect it.\n   Protection of the private key information is\
    \ vital to public key\n   cryptography.  The consequences of disclosure depend\
    \ on the purpose\n   of the private key.  If a private key is used for signature,\
    \ then the\n   disclosure allows unauthorized signing.  If a private key is used\
    \ for\n   key management, then disclosure allows unauthorized parties to access\n\
    \   the managed keying material.  The encryption algorithm used in the\n   encryption\
    \ process must be as 'strong' as the key it is protecting.\n"
