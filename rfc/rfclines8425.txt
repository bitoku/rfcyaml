Abstract The Prefix Information Option (PIO) in the IPv6 Neighbor Discovery Router Advertisement message defines an 8 bit flag field; this field has two flags defined, and the remaining 6 bits are reserved (Reserved1).
RFC 6275 defines a flag from this field without creating an IANA registry or updating RFC 4861.
The purpose of this document is to create an IANA registry for the PIO flags.
This document updates RFC 4861.
The Prefix Information Option (PIO) in the IPv6 Neighbor Discovery Router Advertisement message defines an 8 bit flag field; this field has two flags defined and the remaining 6 bits are reserved (Reserved1).
RFC 6275 defines a flag from this field without creating an IANA registry or updating RFC 4861.
The purpose of this document is to create a new registry for the PIO flags.
Current Prefix Information Option Flags
Currently, the Neighbor Discovery Protocol Prefix Information Option [RFC4861] contains the following one bit flags defined in published RFCs: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7    L A R Reserved1
A Autonomous Address Configuration Flag [RFC4861] R Router Address Flag [RFC6275]
This document updates Section 4.6.2 "Prefix Information" of [RFC4861] to point to the IANA registry that is created in this document (see Section 4).
Specifically, the current list of flags in the Prefix Information Option can be found in the "IPv6 Neighbor Discovery Prefix Information Option Flags" registry.
IANA Considerations IANA has created a new registry for IPv6 Neighbor Discovery Prefix Information Option flags.
This registry includes the current flags in the PIO.
The initial contents of the registry are as follows:
IPv6 Neighbor Discovery Prefix Information Option Flags
The assignment of new flags in the PIO option header requires Standards Action [RFC8126].
The registry for these flags is available at <http://www.iana.org/assignments/icmpv6 parameters>. 5.
This document has no security considerations.
