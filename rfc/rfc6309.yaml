- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   This document relaxes the IANA rules for Multimedia Internet\
    \ KEYing\n   (MIKEY) [RFC3830].  The IANA rules defined in [RFC3830], [RFC4563],\n\
    \   [RFC4909], and [RFC5410] are affected.  In addition, the rules\n   specified\
    \ in [RFC6043] are re-specified here.\n   Most of the values in MIKEY namespaces\
    \ are divided into two ranges:\n   \"IETF Review\" (or \"IETF Consensus\" as it\
    \ was previously called) and\n   \"Reserved for Private Use\" [RFC5226].  This\
    \ document changes, for\n   majority of the namespaces, the requirement of \"\
    IETF Review\" to \"IETF\n   Review or IESG Approval\" [RFC5226].  For some namespaces,\
    \ the\n   requirement is changed to \"Specification Required\" [RFC5226].\n  \
    \ The rationale for this update is that there can be situations where\n   it makes\
    \ sense to grant an allocation under special circumstances or\n   that time has\
    \ shown that the current requirement is unnecessarily\n   strict for some of the\
    \ namespaces.  By changing the current IANA\n   rules to also allow for \"IESG\
    \ Approval\" [RFC5226], it becomes\n   possible for the Internet Engineering Steering\
    \ Group (IESG) to\n   consider an allocation request, even if it does not fulfill\
    \ the\n   default rule.  For instance, an experimental protocol extension could\n\
    \   perhaps deserve a new payload type as long as a sufficient number of\n   types\
    \ still remains, and the MIKEY community is happy with such an\n   allocation.\
    \  Moreover, for some registries, a stable specification\n   would be a sufficient\
    \ requirement, and this is thus reflected in the\n   updated IANA rules.  For\
    \ instance, an RFC via the Independent Stream\n   at the RFC Editor is sufficient\
    \ for some registries and does not\n   force an IETF evaluation of a particular\
    \ new extension for which\n   there is no general demand.  Nevertheless, \"IETF\
    \ Review\" is still\n   encouraged (instead of using the \"IESG Approval\" path)\
    \ if there is\n   doubt about whether or not it is needed for a new allocation.\n\
    \   The rest of this document is structured as follows.  Section 2\n   defines\
    \ the new IANA rules.  Section 3 discusses the security\n   implications of this\
    \ document.  Sections 4, 5, 6, and 7 explain the\n   changes to [RFC3830], [RFC4563],\
    \ [RFC4909], [RFC5410], and [RFC6043].\n"
- title: 2.  IANA Considerations
  contents:
  - "2.  IANA Considerations\n   IANA updated the registries related to MIKEY as specified\
    \ below.  All\n   other MIKEY IANA registries remain unchanged.\n   New values\
    \ for the version field ([RFC3830], Section 6.1) and the C\n   envelope key cache\
    \ indicator ([RFC3830], Section 6.3) field can be\n   allocated via \"IETF Review\"\
    .\n   The \"IETF Review\" requirement for adding new values into namespaces,\n\
    \   originally defined in [RFC3830], is to be changed to \"IETF Review or\n  \
    \ IESG Approval\".  This change affects the following namespaces:\n   o  data\
    \ type ([RFC3830], Section 6.1)\n   o  Next payload ([RFC3830], Section 6.1)\n\
    \   o  PRF func ([RFC3830], Section 6.1)\n   o  CS ID map type ([RFC3830], Section\
    \ 6.1)\n   o  Encr alg ([RFC3830], Section 6.2)\n   o  MAC alg ([RFC3830], Section\
    \ 6.2)\n   o  DH-Group ([RFC3830], Section 6.4)\n   o  S type ([RFC3830], Section\
    \ 6.5)\n   o  TS type ([RFC3830], Section 6.6)\n   o  ID Type ([RFC3830], Section\
    \ 6.7)\n   o  Cert Type ([RFC3830], Section 6.7)\n   o  Hash func ([RFC3830],\
    \ Section 6.8)\n   o  SRTP Type ([RFC3830], Section 6.10)\n   o  SRTP encr alg\
    \ ([RFC3830], Section 6.10)\n   o  SRTP auth alg ([RFC3830], Section 6.10)\n \
    \  o  SRTP PRF ([RFC3830], Section 6.10)\n   o  FEC order ([RFC3830], Section\
    \ 6.10)\n   o  Key Data Type ([RFC3830], Section 6.13)\n   o  KV Type ([RFC3830],\
    \ Section 6.13)\n   The \"IETF Review\" requirement for the following registries,\n\
    \   originally defined in [RFC3830], [RFC4563], [RFC4909], and [RFC5410],\n  \
    \ is to be changed to \"Specification Required\".\n   o  Prot type ([RFC3830],\
    \ Section 6.10)\n   o  Error no ([RFC3830], Section 6.12)\n   o  General Extension\
    \ Type ([RFC3830], Section 6.15)\n   o  KEY ID Type ([RFC4563], Section 4)\n \
    \  o  OMA BCAST Data Subtype ([RFC5410], Section 3)\n   The \"Specification Required\"\
    \ requirement remains for the following\n   namespaces:\n   o  TS Role ([RFC6043],\
    \ Section 6.4)\n   o  ID Role ([RFC6043], Section 6.6)\n   o  RAND Role ([RFC6043],\
    \ Section 6.8)\n   o  Ticket Type ([RFC6043], Section 6.10)\n   The range of valid\
    \ values for certain namespaces defined in the IANA\n   considerations of [RFC3830]\
    \ was not explicitly defined and is\n   clarified here as follows:\n         \
    \    +--------------------------------+--------------+\n             | Namespace\
    \                      | Valid values |\n             +--------------------------------+--------------+\n\
    \             | C Envelope Key Cache Indicator | 0 - 3        |\n            \
    \ | S type                         | 0 - 15       |\n             | Key Data Type\
    \                  | 0 - 15       |\n             | KV Type                  \
    \      | 0 - 15       |\n             +--------------------------------+--------------+\n"

  - "3.  Security Considerations\n   This specification does not change the security\
    \ properties of MIKEY.\n   However, when new values are introduced without IETF\
    \ consensus, care\n   needs to be taken to assure that possible security concerns\
    \ regarding\n   the new values are still addressed.\n"

  contents:
  - "4.  Changes from RFC 3830\n   Section 2 relaxes the requirements from those defined\
    \ in [RFC3830].\n   A number of namespaces now have the \"IETF Review or IESG\
    \ Approval\"\n   requirement, when they previously had the \"IETF Review\" requirement.\n\
    \   In addition, some namespaces now have the \"Specification Required\"\n   requirement.\n"

  contents:
  - "6.  Changes from RFC 4909 and RFC 5410\n   Section 2 relaxes the requirements\
    \ from those defined in [RFC4909].\n   The OMA BCAST Data Subtype namespace now\
    \ has the \"Specification\n   Required\" requirement.  Note that [RFC5410] obsoleted\
    \ [RFC4909] but\n   does not actually define the IANA rules itself.  As a result,\
    \ from\n   now on, this RFC defines the IANA requirements for the OMA BCAST Data\n\
    \   Subtype namespace.\n"
- title: 7.  Changes from RFC 6043
  contents:
  - "7.  Changes from RFC 6043\n   There are no changes to the rules specified in\
    \ [RFC6043].  However,\n   for sake of completeness, Section 2 re-specifies these\
    \ rules in this\n   document, and from now on, this RFC defines the IANA requirements\
    \ for\n   those namespaces.\n"
