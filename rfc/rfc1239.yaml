- title: Statement
  contents:
  - "Statement\n   In the past, MIBs have been assigned arcs in the experimental MIB\n\
    \   namespace early in their development and then were not assigned arcs\n   in\
    \ the standard MIB namespace until they reached Full Standard\n   status.  This\
    \ practice required vendors to revise their\n   implementations when a MIB went\
    \ from Draft to Full Standard status,\n   even though there was probably no substantive\
    \ technical change in the\n   definitions.  This practice could also engender\
    \ operational problems\n   in the field at an undesirably late stage of the standardization\n\
    \   process.  It was also observed that this practice could discourage\n   implementation\
    \ until the Full Standard stage and that this, too,\n   would be undesirable.\
    \  So, a preferable practice is to assign arcs in\n   the standard MIB namespace\
    \ at the earliest phase of standardization\n   and to preserve these assignments\
    \ as the standard progresses.\n   This memo specifically updates:\n      RFC 1229\
    \ - \"Extensions to the Generic-Interface MIB\"\n      RFC 1230 - \"IEEE 802.4\
    \ Token Bus MIB\"\n      RFC 1231 - \"IEEE 802.5 Token Ring MIB\"\n      RFC 1232\
    \ - \"Definitions of Managed Objects for the DS1 Interface\n                 \
    \ Type\"\n      RFC 1233 - \"Definitions of Managed Objects for the DS3 Interface\n\
    \                  Type\"\n   with new codes.  In the future, consult each MIB\
    \ publication for new\n   code assignments.\n"
