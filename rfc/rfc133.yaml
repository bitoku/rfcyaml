  contents:
  - "1A   Handshaking\n   I think that Mr Bhushan(RFC #114, NIC 5823) is not strict\
    \ enough in\n   his concept of a transaction sequence.  Every transaction should\n\
    \   prompt a response from its recipient (recall Kalin's crates --\n   RFC #60,\
    \ NIC 4762).  Control should pass back and forth until the\n   server terminates.\
    \  The server _always_ gets the last word (more on\n   error recovery later).\n\
    \   Some sample interchanges are given.\n       User                Server   \
    \    Comments\n       <I><...>    ==>                  Identify self\n       <R><...>\
    \    ==>                  Retrieval request\n                   <==     <rs> \
    \        I've got your file\n       <rr>        ==>                  Send it\n\
    \       <rr>        ==>                  Got it\n       <S><...>    ==>      \
    \            Store request\n                   <==     <rr>         Ok, go ahead\n\
    \                   <==     <rr>         Ok\n   See section 2B, below, for examples\
    \ of error recovery.\n"
- title: 1B  Extensions to the file transfer protocol
  contents:
  - "1B  Extensions to the file transfer protocol\n   The file transfer protocol needs\
    \ a mechanism for accessing individual\n   records of a file.  This will be particularly\
    \ useful when very large\n   data bases appear on the network.  The following\
    \ definitions should\n   be added to the protocol:\n   The store(S) and retrieve(R)\
    \ requests have the data field format\n   <key>, where <key> has the syntax:\n\
    \    <key>::=<devicename>RS<filename>US<keyname> | <filename>US<keyname>.\n  \
    \                         --          --                      --\n   The <pathname>\
    \ syntax is changed to:\n       <pathname>::=<devicename> | <filename> | <pathname>RS<filename>.\n\
    \                                                          --\n   If a retrieve(R)\
    \ request is given with a data field with <key>\n   syntax rather than <pathname>\
    \ syntax, then the returned data will\n   consist of the record following the\
    \ matching <key>.  If a store(S)\n   request is given with a data field of <key>\
    \ syntax, then the\n   supplied data will replace the record following the matching\n\
    \   <keyname>.  If the keyname does not exist, the record will be\n   appended\
    \ to the named file.  The individual installation must\n   provide the linkage\
    \ between the <keyname> and the record it\n   references.\n   In addition, the\
    \ lookup(L) request will provide a list of keynames\n   into a file (or the name\
    \ of a file which contains the keynames).\n   Transaction code F (request File\
    \ directory) requests a listing of\n   available files.  The data field of the\
    \ F transaction is of the\n   form:  <pathname>GS<pathname>GS...  All files in\
    \ the server system\n                    --          --\n   which match one or\
    \ more of the given <pathname> specifiers are\n   listed in a return file.  The\
    \ format of the data fields of this\n   file is:  <pathname>GS<pathname>GS...\
    \  If a <pathname> field in\n                       --          --\n   the request\
    \ transaction does not include a <name> field, the\n   default is all files on\
    \ the given device.  Some examples are given:\n       <F><DC1 DSK[62,50]] GS JOE>\n\
    \           ---             --\n   This example requests a list of all files on\
    \ the disk specified by\n   [62,50] plus all files named JOE.  The response could\
    \ contain in\n   the data field:\n     <DC1 DSK[62,50] RS ALPHA RS BETA RS JOE\
    \ GS DC1 DSK[10,50] RS JOE>\n      ---            --       --      --     -- ---\
    \            --\n   This message states that in the [62,50] area of the disk there\
    \ are\n   files ALPHA, BETA, and JOE, and that JOE is also a file in the\n   [10,50]\
    \ area of the disk.\n"

    \ to clear the link completely and resynchronize.  I\n   suggest that an 8-bit\
    \ argument be appended to the interrupt-on-link\n   NCP message (INR, INS).  The\
    \ receiver would send <INR><error> to\n   indicate that the block boundaries were\
    \ lost and all incoming data\n   is being discarded.  The sender, upon receiving\
    \ the INR, would\n   flush all queued output and wait for the link to clear. \
    \ The NCP\n   would then send a <INS><newsync> message and, when it was received\n\
    \   (RFNM returned), a negative termination would be sent on the link.\n   The\
    \ receiver begins accepting data again when the INS is received.\n   This assumes\
    \ that any process can flush untransmitted data and\n   detect a clear link. \
    \ Note that this method is useable on any\n   simplex connection.\n"
