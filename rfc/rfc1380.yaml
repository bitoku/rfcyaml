  - "1. INTRODUCTION\n   It seems unlikely that the designers of IP ever imagined\
    \ at the time\n   what phenomenal success the Internet would achieve.  Internet\n\
    \   connections were initially intended primarily for mainframe computers\n  \
    \ at sites performing DARPA-sponsored research.  Now, of course, the\n   Internet\
    \ has extended its reach to the desktop and is beginning to\n   extend into the\
    \ home.  No longer the exclusive purview of pure R&D\n   establishments, the Internet\
    \ has become well entrenched in parts of\n   the corporate world and is beginning\
    \ to make inroads into secondary\n   and even primary schools.  While once it\
    \ was an almost exclusively\n   U.S. phenomenon, the Internet now extends to every\
    \ continent and\n   within a few years may well include network connections in\
    \ every\n   country.\n   Over the past couple of years, we have seen increasingly\
    \ strong\n   indications that all of this success will stress the limits of IP\n\
    \   unless appropriate corrective actions are taken.  The supply of\n   unallocated\
    \ Class B network numbers is rapidly dwindling, and the\n   amount of routing\
    \ information now carried in the Internet is\n   increasingly taxing the abilities\
    \ of both the routers and the people\n   who have to manage them.  Somewhat longer-term,\
    \ it is possible that\n   we will run out of host addresses or network numbers\
    \ altogether.\n   While these problems could be avoided by attempting to restrict\
    \ the\n   growth of the Internet, most people would prefer solutions that allow\n\
    \   growth to continue.  Fortunately, it appears that such solutions are\n   possible,\
    \ and that, in fact, our biggest problem is having too many\n   possible solutions\
    \ rather than too few.\n   This memo provides a preliminary report of IESG deliberations\
    \ on how\n   routing and addressing issues can be pursued in the IAB/IETF.\n \
    \  In following sections, we will discuss in more detail the problems\n   confronting\
    \ us and possible approaches.  We will give a brief\n   overview of the ROAD group\
    \ and related activities in the IETF.  We\n   will then discuss possible courses\
    \ of action in the IETF.\n   Ultimately, the IESG will issue a recommendation\
    \ from the IESG/IETF\n   to the IAB.\n"

  - "2.1  The Problems\n   The Internet now faces three growth-related problems:\n\
    \     - Class B network number exhaustion - Routing table explosion\n     - IP\
    \ address space exhaustion\n"
- title: 2.1.1  Class B Network Number Exhaustion
  contents:
  - "2.1.1  Class B Network Number Exhaustion\n   Over the last several years, the\
    \ number of network numbers assigned\n   and the number of network numbers configured\
    \ into the Merit NSFnet\n   routing database have roughly doubled every 12 months.\
    \  This has led\n   to estimates that, at the current allocation rate, and in\
    \ the absence\n   of corrective measures, it will take less than 2 years to allocate\n\
    \   all of the currently unassigned Class B network numbers.\n   After that, new\
    \ sites which wished to connect more than the number of\n   hosts possible in\
    \ a single Class C (253 hosts) would need to be\n   assigned multiple Class C\
    \ networks.  This will exacerbate the routing\n   table explosion problems described\
    \ next.\n"
- title: 2.1.2.  Routing Table Explosion
  contents:
  - "2.1.2.  Routing Table Explosion\n   As the number of networks connected to the\
    \ Internet has grown, the\n   amount of routing information that has to be passed\
    \ around to keep\n   track of them all is likewise growing.  This is leading to\
    \ two types\n   of problems.\n"
- title: Hardware and Protocol Limits
  contents:
  - "Hardware and Protocol Limits\n   Routing protocols must pass around this information,\
    \ and routers must\n   store and use it.  This taxes memory limits in the routers,\
    \ and can\n   also consume significant bandwidth when older routing protocols\
    \ are\n   used, (such as EGP and RIP, which were designed for a much smaller\n\
    \   number of networks).\n   The limits on the memory in the routers seem to be\
    \ the most pressing.\n   It is already the case that the routers used in the MILNET\
    \ are\n   incapable of handling all of the current routes, and most other\n  \
    \ service providers have found the need to periodically upgrade their\n   routers\
    \ to accommodate ever larger quantities of routing information.\n   An informal\
    \ survey of router vendors by the ROAD group estimated that\n   most of the currently\
    \ deployed generation of high-end routers will\n   support O(16000) routes.  This\
    \ will be probably be adequate for the\n   next 12 to 18 months at the current\
    \ rate of growth.  Most vendors\n   have begun, or will soon begin, to ship routers\
    \ capable of handling\n   O(64000) routes, which should be adequate for an additional\
    \ two years\n   if the above Class B Network Number Exhaustion problem is solved.\n"
- title: Human Limits
  contents:
  - "Human Limits\n   The number of routes does not merely tax the network's physical\n\
    \   plant.  Network operators have found that the inter-domain routing\n   protocol\
    \ mechanisms often need to be augmented by a considerable\n   amount of configuration\
    \ to make the paths followed by packets be\n   consistent with the policies and\
    \ desires of the network operators.\n   As the number of networks increases, the\
    \ configuration (and the\n   traffic monitoring to determine whether the configuration\
    \ has been\n   done correctly) becomes increasingly difficult and time-consuming.\n\
    \   Although it is not possible to determine a number of networks (and\n   therefore\
    \ a time frame) where human limits will be exceeded, network\n   operators view\
    \ this as a significant short-term problem.\n"

  contents:
  - "2.1.3.  IP Address Exhaustion\n   If the current exponential growth rate continues\
    \ unabated, the number\n   of computers connected to the Internet will eventually\
    \ exceed the\n   number of possible IP addresses.  Because IP addresses are divided\n\
    \   into \"network\" and \"host\" portions, we may not ever fully run out of\n\
    \   IP addresses because we will run out of IP network numbers first.\n   There\
    \ is considerable uncertainty regarding the timeframe when we\n   might exceed\
    \ the limits of the IP address space.  However, the issue\n   is serious enough\
    \ that it deserves our earliest attention.  It is\n   very important that we develop\
    \ solutions to this potential problem\n   well before we are in danger of actually\
    \ running out of addresses.\n"

    \ addressed over the coming\n   years.  These are issues regarding advanced functionality\

  contents:
  - "2.2.1.  Class B Network Number Exhaustion\n   A number of approaches have been\
    \ suggested for how we might slow the\n   exhaustion of the Class B IP addresses.\
    \  These include:\n      1)   Reclaiming those Class B network numbers which have\
    \ been\n      assigned but are either unused or used by networks which are not\n\
    \      connected to the Internet.\n      2)   Modifying address assignment policies\
    \ to slow the assignment\n      of Class B network numbers by assigning multiple\
    \ Class C network\n      numbers to organizations which are only a little bit\
    \ to big to be\n      accommodated by a Class C network number.\n         Note:\
    \ It is already the case that a Class B number is assigned\n         only if the\
    \ applicant would need more than \"several\" Class C\n         networks.  The\
    \ value of \"several\" has increased over time from\n         1 to (currently)\
    \ 32.\n      3)   Use the Class C address space to form aggregations of\n    \
    \  different size than the normal normal Class C addresses.  Such\n      schemes\
    \ include Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) [Fuller92]\n      and the C# scheme\
    \ [Solen92].\n"
- title: 2.2.2.  Routing Table Explosion
  contents:
  - "2.2.2.  Routing Table Explosion\n   As was described earlier, there are actually\
    \ two parts to this\n   problem.  They each have slightly different possible approaches:\n"
- title: Hardware and Protocol Limits
  contents:
  - "Hardware and Protocol Limits\n      1) More thrust.  We could simply recognize\
    \ the fact that routers\n      which need full Internet routing information will\
    \ require large\n      amounts of memory and processing capacity.  This is at\
    \ best a very\n      short-term approach, and we will always need to face this\
    \ problem\n      in the long-term.\n      2) Route servers (a variant of the \"\
    More Thrust\" solution).\n      Instead of requiring every router to store complete\
    \ routing\n      information, mechanisms could be developed to allow the tasks\
    \ of\n      computing and storing routes to be offloaded to a server.  Routers\n\
    \      would request routes from the server as needed (presumably caching\n  \
    \    to improve performance).\n      3) Topology engineering.  Many network providers\
    \ already try to\n      design their networks in such a way that only a few of\
    \ the routers\n      need complete routing information (the others rely on default\n\
    \      routes to reach destinations that they don't have explicit routes\n   \
    \   to).  While this is inconvenient for network operators, it is a\n      trend\
    \ which is likely to continue.\n      It is also the case that network providers\
    \ could further reduce\n      the number of routers which need full routing information\
    \ by\n      accepting some amount of suboptimal routing or reducing alternate\n\
    \      paths used for backup.\n      4) Charging-based solutions.  By charging\
    \ for network number\n      advertisements, it might be possible to discourage\
    \ sites from\n      connecting more networks to the Internet than they get significant\n\
    \      value from having connected.\n      5) Aggregation of routing information.\
    \  It is fairly clear that in\n      the long-term it will be necessary for addresses\
    \ to be more\n      hierarchical.  This will allow routes to many networks to\
    \ be\n      collapsed into a single summary route.  Therefore, an important\n\
    \      question is whether aggregation can also be part of the short-term\n  \
    \    solution.  Of the proposals to date, only CIDR could provide\n      aggregation\
    \ in the short-term.  All longer-term proposals should\n      aggregation.\n"
- title: Human Limits
  contents:
  - "Human Limits\n      1) Additional human resources.  Network providers could devote\n\
    \      additional manpower to routing management, or accept the\n      consequences\
    \ of a reduced level of routing management.  This is\n      obviously unattractive\
    \ as anything other than a very short-term\n      solution.\n      2) Better tools.\
    \  Network operators and router vendors could work\n      to develop more powerful\
    \ paradigms and mechanisms for routing\n      management.\n      The IETF has\
    \ already undertaken some work in the areas of route\n      filtering and route\
    \ leaking.\n"
- title: 2.2.3.  IP Address Exhaustion
  contents:
  - "2.2.3.  IP Address Exhaustion\n   The following general approaches have been\
    \ suggested for dealing with\n   the possible exhaustion of the IP address space:\n\
    \      1) Protocol modifications to provide a larger address space.  By\n    \
    \  enhancing IP or by transitioning to another protocol with a larger\n      address\
    \ space, we could substantially increase the number of\n      available network\
    \ numbers and addresses.\n      2) Addresses which are not globally unique.  Several\
    \ proposed\n      schemes have emerged whereby a host's domain name is globally\n\
    \      unique, but its IP address would be unique only within it's local\n   \
    \   routing domain.  These schemes usually involve address translating\n     \
    \ 3) Partitioned Internet.  The Internet could be partitioned into\n      areas,\
    \ such that a host's IP address would be unique only within\n      its own area.\
    \  Such schemes generally postulate application\n      gateways to interconnect\
    \ the areas.  This is not unlike the\n      approach often used to connect differing\
    \ protocol families.\n      4) Reclaiming network numbers.  Network numbers which\
    \ are not\n      used, or are used by networks which are not connected to the\n\
    \      Internet, could conceivably be reclaimed for general Internet use.\n  \
    \    This isn't a long-term solution, but could possibly help in the\n      interim\
    \ if for some reason address exhaustion starts to occur\n      unexpectedly soon.\n"

  - "3.1 The IAB Architecture Retreats\n   In July 1991, the IAB held a special workshop\
    \ to consider critical\n   issues in the IP architecture (Clark91).  Of particular\
    \ concern were\n   the problems related to Internet growth and scaling.  The IAB\
    \ felt\n   the issues were of sufficient concern to begin organizing a special\n\
    \   group to explore the issues and to explore possible solutions.  Peter\n  \
    \ Ford (LANL) was asked to organize this effort.  The IAB reconvened\n   the architecture\
    \ workshop in January 1992 to further examine these\n   critical issues, and to\
    \ meet jointly with the then-formed ROAD group\n   (see below).\n"

    \ Working Groups\n   independently began a concerted exploration of the issues\

    \   aggregation by using address masks in BGP to do \"supernetting\"\n   (rather\
    \ than \"subnetting\").  This approach would eventually evolve\n   into CIDR.\
    \  The BGP WG decided to form a separate subgroup, to be led\n   by Phill Gross\
    \ (ANS) to pursue this solution.\n"
- title: 3.3 The ROAD Group and Beyond
  contents:
  - "3.3 The ROAD Group and Beyond\n   At the Santa Fe IETF, the initially separate\
    \ IAB and BGP WG\n   activities were combined into a special effort, named the\
    \ \"ROuting\n   and ADdressing (ROAD) Group\", to be co-chaired by Ford and Gross.\n\
    \   The group was asked to explore possible near-term approaches for the\n   scaling\
    \ problems described in the last section, namely:\n       - Class B address exhaustion\n\
    \       - Routing table explosion\n       - IP address space exhaustion\n   The\
    \ ROAD group was asked to report back to the IETF at the San Diego\n   IETF (March\
    \ 1992).  Suggested guidelines included minimizing changes\n   to hosts, must\
    \ be incrementally deployable, and must provide support\n   for a billion networks.\n\
    \   The ROAD group was not a traditional open IETF working group.  It was\n  \
    \ always presumed that this was a one-time special group that would\n   lead to\
    \ the formation of other IETF WGs after its report in San\n   Diego.\n   The ROAD\
    \ group held several face-face meetings between the November\n   1991 (Santa Fe)\
    \ and March 1992 (San Diego) IETF meetings.  This\n   included several times at\
    \ the Santa Fe IETF meeting, December 1991 in\n   Reston VA, January 1992 in Boston\
    \ (in conjunction with the IAB\n   architecture workshop), and January 1992 in\
    \ Arizona).  There was also\n   much discussion by electronic mail.\n   The group\
    \ produced numerous documents, which have variously been made\n   available as\
    \ Internet-Drafts or RFCs (see Bibliography in Appendix\n   D).\n   As follow-up,\
    \ the ROAD co-chairs reported to the IETF plenary in\n   March 1992 in San Diego.\
    \  Plus, several specific ROAD-related\n   activities took place during the IETF\
    \ meeting that week.\n   The Ford/Gross presentation served as a preliminary report\
    \ from the\n   ROAD group.  The basic thrust was:\n      1.  The Internet community\
    \ needs a better way to deal with current\n      addresses (e.g., hierarchical\
    \ address assignments for routing\n      aggregation to help slow Class B exhaustion\
    \ and routing table\n      explosion).  Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR;\
    \ also called\n      \"supernetting\") was recommended.  CIDR calls for:\n   \
    \     - The development of a plan for hierarchical IP address\n          assignment\
    \ for aggregation in routing,\n        - Enhanced \"classless\" Inter-domain protocols\
    \ (i.e., carry\n          address masks along with IP addresses),\n        - Inter-Domain\
    \ routing \"Usage documents\" for using addressing\n          and routing plan\
    \ with the enhanced inter-domain protocols,\n          and for interacting with\
    \ IGPs.\n      2.  The Internet community needs bigger addresses for the Internet\n\
    \      to stem IP address exhaustion.  The ROAD group explored several\n     \
    \ approaches in some depth.  Some of these approaches were discussed\n      at\
    \ the San Diego IETF.  However, a final recommendation of a\n      single approach\
    \ did not emerge.\n      3.  The Internet community needs to focus more effort\
    \ on future\n      directions for Internet routing and advanced Internet layer\n\
    \      features.\n   Other ROAD-related activities at the San Diego IETF meeting\

  - "4.1 The Need For Interim Solutions\n   Solutions to the problems of advanced\
    \ Internet layer functionality\n   are far from being well understood.  While\
    \ we should certainly\n   encourage research in these areas, it is premature to\
    \ start an\n   engineering effort for an Internet layer which would solve not\
    \ only\n   the scaling problems but also those other issues.\n   Plus, most approaches\
    \ to the problem of IP address space exhaustion\n   involve changes to the Internet\
    \ layer.  Such approaches mean changes\n   changes to host software that will\
    \ require us to face the very\n   difficult transition of a large installed base.\n\
    \   It is therefore not likely that we can (a) develop a single solution\n   for\
    \ the near-term scaling problems that will (b) also solve the\n   longer-term\
    \ problems of advanced Internet-layer functionality, that\n   we can (c) choose,\
    \ implement and deploy before the nearer-term\n   problems of Class B exhaustion\

    \ to the inevitable conclusion that we\n   will need to make major enhancements\

- title: 4.2 The Proposed Phases
  contents:
  - "4.2 The Proposed Phases\n   The IESG recommends that we divide the overall course\
    \ of action into\n   several phases.  For lack of a better vocabulary, we will\
    \ term these\n   \"immediate\", \"short-term\", mid-term\", and \"long-term\"\
    \ phases.  But,\n   as the ROAD group pointed out, we should start all the phases\n\
    \   immediately. We cannot afford to act on these phases consecutively!\n   In\
    \ brief, the phases are:\n    - \"Immediate\".  These are configuration and engineering\
    \ actions that\n   can take place immediately without protocol design, development,\
    \ or\n   deployment.  There are a number of actions that can begin\n   immediately.\
    \  Although none of these will solve any of the problems,\n   they can help slow\
    \ the onset of the problems.\n   The IESG specifically endorses:\n       1) the\
    \ need for more conservative address assignment\n          policies,\n       2)\
    \ alignment of new address assignment policies with any new\n          aggregation\
    \ schemes,\n       3) efforts to reclaim unused Class B addresses,\n       4)\
    \ installation of more powerful routers by network operators\n          at key\
    \ points in the Internet, and\n       5) careful attention to topology engineering.\n\
    \    - \"Short-term\".  Actions in this phase are aimed at dealing with\n   Class\
    \ B exhaustion and routing table explosion.  These problems are\n   deemed to\
    \ be quite pressing and to need solutions well before the IP\n   address exhaustion\
    \ problem needs to be or could be solved.  In this\n   timeframe, changes to hosts\
    \ can *not* be considered.\n    - \"Mid-term\".  In the mid-term, the issue of\
    \ IP address exhaustion\n   must be solved.  This is the most fundamental problem\
    \ facing the IP\n   architecture.  Depending on the expected timeframe, changes\
    \ to host\n   software could be considered.  Note: whatever approach is taken,\
    \ it\n   must also deal with the routing table explosion.  If it does not,\n \
    \  then we will simply be forced to deal with that problem again, but in\n   a\
    \ larger address space.\n    - \"Long-term\".  Taking a broader view, the IESG\
    \ feels that advanced\n   Internet layer functionality, like QOS support and \
    \ resource\n   reservation, will be crucial to the long-term success of the Internet\n\
    \   architecture.\n   Therefore, planning for advanced Internet layer functionality\
    \ should\n   play a key role in our choice of mid-term solutions.\n   In particular,\
    \ we need to keep several things in mind:\n      1) The long-term solution will\
    \ require replacement and/or\n      extension of the Internet layer.  This will\
    \ be a significant\n      trauma for vendors, operators, and for users.  Therefore,\
    \ it is\n      particularly important that we either minimize the trauma involved\n\
    \      in deploying the sort-and mid-term solutions, or we need to assure\n  \
    \    that the short- and mid-term solutions will provide a smooth\n      transition\
    \ path for the long-term solutions.\n      2) The long-term solution will likely\
    \ require globally unique\n      endpoint identifiers with an hierarchical structure\
    \ to aid\n      routing.  Any effort to define hierarchy and assignment mechanisms\n\
    \      for short- or mid-term solutions would, if done well, probably\n      have\
    \ long-term usefulness, even if the long-term solution uses\n      radically different\
    \ message formats.\n      3) To some extent, development and deployment of the\
    \ interim\n      measures will divert resources away from other important projects,\n\
    \      including the development of the long-term solution.  This\n      diversion\
    \ should be carefully considered when choosing which\n      interim measures to\
    \ pursue.\n"
- title: 4.3  A Solution For Routing Table Explosion -- CIDR
  contents:
  - "4.3  A Solution For Routing Table Explosion -- CIDR\n   The IESG accepted ROAD's\
    \ endorsement of CIDR [Fuller92].  CIDR solves\n   the routing table explosion\
    \ problem (for the current IP addressing\n   scheme), makes the Class B exhaustion\
    \ problem less important, and\n   buys time for the crucial address exhaustion\
    \ problem.\n   The IESG felt that other alternatives (e.g., C#, see Solen92) did\
    \ not\n   provide both routing table aggregation and Class B conservation at\n\
    \   comparable effort.\n   CIDR will require policy changes, protocol specification\
    \ changes,\n   implementation, and deployment of new router software, but it does\n\
    \   not call for changes to host software.\n   The IESG recommends the following\
    \ course of action to pursue CIDR in\n   the IETF:\n      a. Adopt the CIDR model\
    \ described in Fuller92.\n      b. Develop a plan for \"IP Address Assignment\
    \ Guidelines\".\n      The IESG considered the creation of an addressing plan\
    \ to be an\n      operational issue.  Therefore, the IESG asked Bernhard Stockman\n\
    \      (IESG Operational Requirements Area Co-Director) to lead an effort\n  \
    \    to develop such a plan.  Bernhard Stockman is in a position to\n      bring\
    \ important international input (Stockman92) into this effort\n      because he\
    \ is a key player in RIPE and EBONE and he is a co-chair\n      of the Intercontinental\
    \ Engineering Planning Group (IEPG).\n      A specific proposal [Gerich92] has\
    \ now emerged.  [Gerich92]\n      incorporates the views of the IETF, RIPE, IEPG,\
    \ and the Federal\n      Engineering Planning group (FEPG).\n      c. Pursue CIDR\
    \ extensions to BGP in the BGP WG.\n      This activity stated at the San Diego\
    \ IETF meeting.  A new BGP\n      specification, BGP4, incorporating the CIDR\
    \ extensions, is now\n      available for public comment [Rekhter92a].\n     \
    \ d. Form a new WG to consider CIDR-related extensions to IDRP\n      (e.g., specify\
    \ how run IDRP for IP inter-domain routing).\n      e. Give careful consideration\
    \ to how CIDR will be deployed in the\n      Internet.\n      This includes issues\
    \ such as how to maintain address aggregation\n      across non-CIDR domains and\
    \ how CIDR and various IGPs will need to\n      interact.  Depending on the status\
    \ of the combined CIDR\n      activities, the IESG may recommend forming a \"\
    CIDR Deployment WG\",\n      along the same lines as the current BGP Deployment\
    \ WG.\n"
- title: 4.4 Regarding "Bigger Internet Addresses"
  contents:
  - "4.4 Regarding \"Bigger Internet Addresses\"\n   In April-May 1992, the IESG reviewed\
    \ the various approaches emerging\n   from  the ROAD group activities -- e.g.,\
    \ \"Simple CLNP\" [Callon92a],\n   \"IP Encaps\"  [Hinden92], \"CNAT\" [Callon92b],\
    \ and \"Nimrod\"\n   [Chiappa91].\n   (Note: These were the only proposals under\
    \ serious consideration in\n   this time period.  Other proposals, namely \"The\
    \ P Internet Protocol\n   (PIP)\" [Tsuchiya92b] and \"The Simple Internet Protocol\
    \ (SIP)\"\n   [Deering92] have since been proposed.  Following the San Diego IETF\n\
    \   deliberations in March, \"Simple CLNP\" evolved into \"TCP and UDP with\n\
    \   Bigger Addresses (TUBA)\", and \"IP Encaps\" evolved into \"IP Address\n \
    \  Encapsulation (IPAE)\" [Hinden92].)\n   The \"Simple CLNP\" approach perhaps\
    \ initially enjoyed more support\n   than other approaches.\n   However, the consensus\
    \ view in the IESG was that the full impact of\n   transition to \"Simple CLNP\"\
    \ (or to any of the proposed approaches)\n   had not yet been explored in sufficient\
    \ detail to make a final\n   recommendation possible at this time.\n   The feeling\
    \ in the IESG was that such important issues as\n      - impact on operational\
    \ infrastructure,\n      - impact on current protocols (e.g., checksum computation\n\
    \        in TCP and UDP under any new IP-level protocol),\n      - deployment\
    \ of new routing protocols,\n      - assignment of new addresses,\n      - impact\
    \ on performance,\n      - ownership of change control\n      - effect of supporting\
    \ new protocols, such as for address\n        resolution,\n      - effect on network\
    \ management and security, and\n      - the costs to network operators and network\
    \ users who must\n        be trained in the architecture and specifics of any\
    \  new\n        protocols needed to be explored in more depth before a\n     \
    \   decision of this magnitude should be made.\n   At first the question seemed\
    \ to be one of timing.\n   At the risk of oversimplifying some very wide ranging\
    \ discussions,\n   many in the IESG felt that if a decision had to be made\n \
    \  *immediately*, then \"Simple CLNP\" might be their choice.  However,\n   they\
    \ would feel much more comfortable if more detailed information\n   was part of\
    \ the decision.\n   The IESG felt there needed to be an open and thorough evaluation\
    \ of\n   any proposed new routing and addressing architecture.  The Internet\n\
    \   community must have a thorough understanding of the impact of\n   changing\
    \ from the current IP architecture to a new one.  The\n   community needs to be\
    \ confident that we all understand which approach\n   has the most benefits for\
    \ long-term internet growth and evolution,\n   and the least impact on the current\
    \ Internet.\n   The IESG considered what additional information and criteria were\n\
    \   needed to choose between alternative approaches.  We also considered\n   the\
    \ time needed for gathering this additional information and the\n   amount of\
    \ time remaining before it was absolutely imperative to make\n   this decision\
    \ (i.e., how much time do we have before we are in danger\n   of running out of\
    \ IP addresses *before* we could deploy a new\n   architecture?).\n   This led\
    \ the IESG to propose a specific set of selection criteria and\n   information,\
    \ and specific milestones and timetable for the decision.\n   The next section\
    \ describes the milestones and timetable for choosing\n   the approach for bigger\
    \ Internet addresses.\n   The selection criteria referenced in the milestones\
    \ are contained in\n   Appendix B.\n"
