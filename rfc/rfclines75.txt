Network Meeting Taking advantage of the FJCC in Houston, I have scheduled a meeting of the Network Working Group in room Astro VII of the Astroworld Hotel at 8:00 p.m.  on Monday, November 16, 1970.
The purpose of this meeting is to discuss several topics related to the practical use of the network.
I have in mind: (a) accounting mechanisms (b) documentation distribution (c) person to person message sending and message storing (d) access to systems by foreign users
Attendees are invited to raise other topics.
I envision that this meeting will spawn smaller subsidiary meetings during the FJCC to pursue these or related topics.
Prospective attendees should notify my secretary Benita Kirstel (213)
825 2368 so that we can be sure the room is large enough.
Unexpected attendees are nevertheless invited.
