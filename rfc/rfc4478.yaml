  - "Abstract\n   This document extends the Internet Key Exchange (IKEv2) Protocol\n\
    \   document [IKEv2].  With some IPsec peers, particularly in the remote\n   access\
    \ scenario, it is desirable to repeat the mutual authentication\n   periodically.\
    \  The purpose of this is to limit the time that security\n   associations (SAs)\
    \ can be used by a third party who has gained\n   control of the IPsec peer. \
    \ This document describes a mechanism to\n   perform this function.\n"
- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   In several cases, such as the remote access scenario, policy\
    \ dictates\n   that the mutual authentication needs to be repeated periodically.\n\
    \   Repeated authentication can usually be achieved by simply repeating\n   the\
    \ Initial exchange by whichever side has a stricter policy.\n   However, in the\
    \ remote access scenario it is usually up to a human\n   user to supply the authentication\
    \ credentials, and often Extensible\n   Authentication Protocol (EAP) is used\
    \ for authentication, which makes\n   it unreasonable or impossible for the remote\
    \ access gateway to\n   initiate the IKEv2 exchange.\n   This document describes\
    \ a new notification that the original\n   Responder can send to the original\
    \ Initiator with the number of\n   seconds before the authentication needs to\
    \ be repeated.  The\n   Initiator SHOULD repeat the Initial exchange before that\
    \ time is\n   expired.  If the Initiator fails to do so, the Responder may close\n\
    \   all Security Associations.\n   Repeated authentication is not the same as\
    \ IKE SA rekeying, and need\n   not be tied to it.  The key words \"MUST\", \"\
    MUST NOT\", \"SHOULD\",\n   \"SHOULD NOT\", and \"MAY\" in this document are to\
    \ be interpreted as\n   described in [RFC2119].\n"
- title: 2.  Authentication Lifetime
  contents:
  - "2.  Authentication Lifetime\n   The Responder in an IKEv2 negotiation MAY be\
    \ configured to limit the\n   time that an IKE SA and the associated IPsec SAs\
    \ may be used before\n   the peer is required to repeat the authentication, through\
    \ a new\n   Initial Exchange.\n   The Responder MUST send this information to\
    \ the Initiator in an\n   AUTH_LIFETIME notification either in the last message\
    \ of an IKE_AUTH\n   exchange, or in an INFORMATIONAL request, which may be sent\
    \ at any\n   time.\n   When sent as part of the IKE SA setup, the AUTH_LIFETIME\
    \ notification\n   is used as follows:\n      Initiator                      \
    \      Responder\n      -------------------------------      -----------------------------\n\

    \         N(AUTH_LIFETIME)}\n   The separate Informational exchange is formed\
    \ as follows:\n                                      <--  HDR, SK {N(AUTH_LIFETIME)}\n\
    \      HDR  SK {}                      -->\n   The AUTH_LIFETIME notification\
    \ is described in Section 3.\n   The original Responder that sends the AUTH_LIFETIME\
    \ notification\n   SHOULD send a DELETE notification soon after the end of the\
    \ lifetime\n   period, unless the IKE SA is deleted before the lifetime period\n\
    \   elapses.  If the IKE SA is rekeyed, then the time limit applies to\n   the\
    \ new SA.\n   An Initiator that received an AUTH_LIFETIME notification SHOULD\n\
    \   repeat the Initial exchange within the time indicated in the\n   notification.\
    \  The time is measured from the time that the original\n   Initiator receives\
    \ the notification.\n   A special case is where the notification is sent in an\
    \ Informational\n   exchange, and the lifetime is zero.  In that case, the original\n\
    \   responder SHOULD allow a reasonable time for the repeated\n   authentication\
    \ to occur.\n   The AUTH_LIFETIME notification MUST be protected and MAY be sent\
    \ by\n   the original Responder at any time.  If the policy changes, the\n   original\
    \ Responder MAY send it again in a new Informational.\n   The new Initial exchange\
    \ is not altered.  The initiator SHOULD delete\n   the old IKE SA within a reasonable\
    \ time of the new Auth exchange.\n"

  - "3.  AUTH_LIFETIME Notification\n   The AUTH_LIFETIME message is a notification\
    \ payload formatted as\n   follows:\n                           1            \

    \ not reasonable to set this value to less than 300\n         (5 minutes) since\
    \ that is too cumbersome for a user.\n         It is also usually not reasonable\
    \ to set this value to more\n         than 86400 (1 day) as that would negate\
    \ the security benefit of\n         repeating the authentication.\n"
- title: 4.  Interoperability with Non-Supporting IKEv2 Implementations
  contents:
  - "4.  Interoperability with Non-Supporting IKEv2 Implementations\n   IKEv2 implementations\
    \ that do not support the AUTH_LIFETIME\n   notification will ignore it and will\
    \ not repeat the authentication.\n   In that case the original Responder will\
    \ send a Delete notification\n   for the IKE SA in an Informational exchange.\
    \  Such implementations\n   may be configured manually to repeat the authentication\
    \ periodically.\n   Non-supporting Responders are not a problem because they will\
    \ simply\n   not send these notifications.  In that case, there is no requirement\n\
    \   that the original Initiator re-authenticate.\n"
- title: 5.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "5.  Security Considerations\n   The AUTH_LIFETIME notification sent by the Responder\
    \ does not\n   override any security policy on the Initiator.  In particular,\
    \ the\n   Initiator may have a different policy regarding re-authentication,\n\
    \   requiring more frequent re-authentication.  Such an Initiator can\n   repeat\
    \ the authentication earlier then is required by the\n   notification.\n   An\
    \ Initiator MAY set reasonable limits on the amount of time in the\n   AUTH_LIFETIME\
    \ notification.  For example, an authentication lifetime\n   of less than 300\
    \ seconds from SA initiation may be considered\n   unreasonable.\n"
