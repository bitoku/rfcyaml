  - "1.  Overview\n   This memo is a revision of RFC 1095 - \"The Common Management\n\
    \   Information Services and Protocol over TCP/IP\" [27].  It defines a\n   network\
    \ management architecture that uses the International\n   Organization for Standardization's\
    \ (ISO) Common Management\n   Information Services/Common Management Information\
    \ Protocol\n   (CMIS/CMIP) in the Internet.  This architecture provides a means\
    \ by\n   which control and monitoring information can be exchanged between a\n\
    \   manager and a remote network element.  In particular, this memo\n   defines\
    \ the means for implementing the International Standard (IS)\n   version of CMIS/CMIP\
    \ on top of both IP-based and OSI-based Internet\n   transport protocols for the\
    \ purpose of carrying management\n   information defined in the Internet-standard\
    \ management information\n   base.  Together with the relevant ISO standards and\
    \ the companion\n   RFCs that describe the initial structure of management information\n\
    \   and management information base, these documents provide the basis\n   for\
    \ a comprehensive architecture and system for managing both IP-\n   based and\
    \ OSI-based internets, and in particular the Internet.\n   In creating this revision\
    \ of RFC 1095, the following technical and\n   editorial changes were made:\n\
    \      1) The tutorial section on OSI Management included in RFC 1095\n      \
    \   has been removed from this document.  After some revisions,\n         the\
    \ tutorial material may be published as another RFC.\n      2) The sections in\
    \ RFC 1095 which discussed the semantics of how\n         to interpret requests\
    \ in the context of Internet MIBs has been\n         removed from this protocol\
    \ document.  This topic is now\n         discussed in the OIM-MIB-II draft document.\
    \  This protocol\n         should be useable with MIB-I or MIB-II.  But, it will\
    \ also be\n         able to exploit the new features of the OIM-MIB-II.\n    \
    \  3) This document is based on the final International Standards\n         for\
    \ CMIS/CMIP (ISO 9595/9596) rather than the Draft\n         International Standards.\n\
    \      4) Many of the original agreements defined in RFC 1095 have been\n    \
    \     accepted and included in the OIW NMSIG implementers agreements.\n      \
    \   Rather than duplicating these agreements, they have been removed\n       \
    \  from this memo.  This document should be read in conjunction\n         with\
    \ ISO 9595/9596 (CMIS/CMIP) and the OIW Stable Agreements\n         document.\n\
    \      5) The Association Negotiation describe in RFC 1095 has been\n        \
    \ changed to align with current international and national\n         agreements.\
    \  But, it has retained backwards compatibility with\n         the assignment\
    \ of an Application Context Name which is identical\n         to the Application\
    \ Context Name specified in RFC 1095.\n"

  - "2.  Introduction\n   This memo is the output of the OSI Internet Management Working\
    \ Group\n   of the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF).  As directed by the\n\
    \   Internet Activites Board (IAB) in RFC 1052, it addresses the need for\n  \
    \ a long-term network management system based on ISO CMIS/CMIP.  This\n   memo\
    \ contains a set of protocol agreements for implementing a network\n   management\
    \ system based on these ISO Management standards.  Now that\n   CMIS/CMIP has\
    \ been voted an International Standard (IS), it has\n   become a stable basis\
    \ for product development.  This profile\n   specifies how to apply CMIP to management\
    \ of both IP-based and OSI-\n   based Internet networks.  Network management using\
    \ ISO CMIP to manage\n   IP-based networks will be refered to as \"CMIP Over TCP/IP\"\
    \ (CMOT).\n   Network management using ISO CMIP to manage OSI-based networks will\n\
    \   be refered to as \"CMIP\".  This memo specifies the protocol agreements\n\
    \   necessary to implement CMIP and accompanying ISO protocols over OSI,\n   TCP\
    \ and UDP transport protocols.\n   This memo must be read in conjunction with\
    \ ISO and Internet documents\n   defining specific protocol standards.  Documents\
    \ defining the\n   following ISO standards are required for the implementor: Abstract\n\
    \   Syntax Notation One (ASN.1) [5, 6], Association Control (ACSE) [7,\n   8],\
    \ Remote Operations (ROSE) [9, 10], Common Management Information\n   Services\
    \ (CMIS) [11] and Common Management Information Protocol\n   (CMIP) [12] with\
    \ their addenda [32-35].  The specification of a\n   lightweight presentation\
    \ layer protocol is required for use with the\n   CMOT section of this profile\
    \ (see RFC 1085 [13]).  The SMI (see RFC\n   1065 [2]), the MIB-I (see RFC 1066\
    \ [3]), the MIB-II (see RFC 1156\n   [28]), and the OIM-MIB-II (see [29]) are\
    \ used with this management\n   system.\n   This memo is divided into sections\
    \ for each of the protocols for\n   which implementors' agreements are needed:\
    \ CMISE, ACSE, ROSE, and,\n   for CMOT, the lightweight presentation protocol.\
    \  The protocol\n   profile defined in this memo draws on the technical work of\
    \ the OSI\n   Network Management Forum [14] and the Network Management Special\n\
    \   Interest Group (NMSIG) of the National Institute of Standards and\n   Technology\
    \ (NIST) (formerly the National Bureau of Standards) [30].\n   Wherever possible,\
    \ an attempt has been made to either directly\n   reference or remain consistent\
    \ with the protocol agreements reached\n   by these groups.\n"
- title: 3.  Protocol Overview
  contents:
  - "3.  Protocol Overview\n   This part of the document is a specification of the\
    \ protocols of the\n   OIM architecture.  Contained herein are the agreements\
    \ required to\n   implement interoperable network management systems using these\n\
    \   protocols.  The protocol suite defined by these implementors'\n   agreements\
    \ will facilitate communication between equipment of\n   different vendors, suppliers,\
    \ and networks.  This will allow the\n   emergence of powerful multivendor network\
    \ management based on ISO\n   models and protocols.\n   The choice of a set of\
    \ protocol standards together with further\n   agreements needed to implement\
    \ those standards is commonly referred\n   to as a \"profile.\"  The selection\
    \ policy for this profile is to use\n   existing standards from the international\
    \ standards community (ISO\n   and CCITT) and the Internet community.  Existing\
    \ ISO standards and\n   draft standards in the area of OSI network management\
    \ form the basis\n   of this profile.  Other ISO application layer standards (ROSE\
    \ and\n   ACSE) are used to support the ISO management protocol (CMIP).  To\n\
    \   ensure interoperability, certain choices and restrictions are made\n   here\
    \ concerning various options and parameters provided by these\n   standards. \
    \  Internet standards are used to provide the underlying\n   network transport.\
    \  These agreements provide a precise statement of\n   the implementation choices\
    \ made for implementing ISO network\n   management standards in IP-based and OSI-based\
    \ internets.\n   In addition to the OIM working group, there are at least two\
    \ other\n   bodies actively engaged in defining profiles for interoperable OSI\n\
    \   network management: the OSI Implementors Workshop (OIW) and the OSI\n   Network\
    \ Management Forum.  Both of these groups are similar to the\n   OIM working group\
    \ in that they are each defining profiles for using\n   ISO standards for network\
    \ management.  Both differ in that they are\n   specifying the use only of underlying\
    \ ISO protocols, while the OIM\n   working group is concerned with using OSI management\
    \ in both OSI and\n   TCP/IP networks.  In the interest of greater future compatibility,\n\
    \   the OIM working group has attempted to make this profile conform as\n   closely\
    \ as possible to the ongoing work of these two bodies.\n   This section will describe\
    \ the CMOT Protocol Suite, the CMIP Protocol\n   Suite and Conformance Requirements\
    \ common to both CMOT and CMIP.\n   Later sections will specify the implementers\
    \ agreements for specific\n   layer protocols that comprise the CMOT and CMIP\
    \ Protocol Suites.\n"

    \ if it has an event to report and no\n           suitable association already\
    \ exists.\n      2.   Managing systems may request any association type.\n   \
    \   3.   An association is created by the requesting system\n           issuing\
    \ an A-ASSOCIATE request with the\n           requestor's AE-TITLE and the desired\
    \ application\n           context.  The responding system then returns\n     \
    \      either 1) an A-ASSOCIATE response with the\n           requestor's AE-TITLE\
    \ and the application context\n           which it wishes to accept or 2) an A-ASSOCIATE\n\
    \           response rejecting the association.\n      4.   Managed systems may\
    \ negotiate \"downward\" from\n           Full to Monitor/Control, Event/Monitor\
    \ or Event by\n           returning the new application context in the\n     \
    \      A-ASSOCIATE response to the managing system during\n           the association\

    \ does not agree with the new\n   context.  A-ABORT is used for invalid negotiation.\
    \  If A-ABORT were\n   to be used to terminate an association, there exists the\
    \ potential\n   for loss of information, such as pending events or confirmations.\n\
    \   A-ABORT must be used, however, when a protocol violation occurs or\n   where\
    \ an association is not yet established.\n"
