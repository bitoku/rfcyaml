  contents:
  - "1.1.  Scope\n   [RFC5254] describes the service provider requirements for extending\n\
    \   the reach of pseudowires across multiple Packet Switched Network\n   (PSN)\
    \ domains.  This is achieved using a multi-segment pseudowire\n   (MS-PW).  An\
    \ MS-PW is defined as a set of two or more contiguous\n   pseudowire (PW) segments\
    \ that behave and function as a single point-\n   to-point PW.  This architecture\
    \ is described in [RFC5659].\n   The procedures for establishing PWs that extend\
    \ across a single PSN\n   domain are described in [RFC4447], while procedures\
    \ for setting up\n   PWs across multiple PSN domains or control plane domains\
    \ are\n   described in [RFC6073].\n   The purpose of this document is to specify\
    \ extensions to the\n   pseudowire control protocol [RFC4447], and [RFC6073] procedures,\
    \ to\n   enable multi-segment PWs to be dynamically placed.  The procedures\n\
    \   follow the guidelines defined in [RFC5036] and enable the reuse of\n   existing\
    \ TLVs, and procedures defined for Single-Segment Pseudowires\n   (SS-PWs) in\
    \ [RFC4447].  Dynamic placement of point-to-multipoint\n   (P2MP) PWs is for further\
    \ study and outside the scope of this\n   document.\n"

    \   This document defines the following additional terms:\n   - Source Terminating\
    \ Provider Edge (ST-PE): A Terminating Provider\n     Edge (T-PE) that assumes\
    \ the active signaling role and initiates\n     the signaling for multi-segment\
    \ PWs.\n   - Target Terminating Provider Edge (TT-PE): A Terminating Provider\n\
    \     Edge (T-PE) that assumes the passive signaling role.  It waits and\n   \
    \  responds to the multi-segment PW signaling message in the reverse\n     direction.\n\
    \   - Forward Direction: ST-PE to TT-PE.\n   - Reverse Direction: TT-PE to ST-PE.\n\
    \   - Pseudowire Routing (PW routing): The dynamic placement of the\n     segments\

    \                      Figure 1: MS-PW Reference Model\n   The PEs that provide\
    \ services to CE1 and CE2 are Terminating PE1\n   (T-PE1) and Terminating PE2\
    \ (T-PE2), respectively.  A PSN tunnel\n   extends from T-PE1 to Switching PE1\
    \ (S-PE1), and a second PSN tunnel\n   extends from S-PE1 to T-PE2 .  PWs are\
    \ used to connect the attachment\n   circuits (ACs) attached to PE1 to the corresponding\
    \ ACs attached to\n   T-PE2.\n   A PW segment on PSN Tunnel 1 is connected to\
    \ a PW segment on PSN\n   Tunnel 2 at S-PE1 to complete the multi-segment PW (MS-PW)\
    \ between\n   T-PE1 and T-PE2.  S-PE1 is therefore the PW switching point and\
    \ is\n   referred to as the switching provider edge (S-PE).  PW Segment 1 and\n\
    \   PW Segment 3 are segments of the same MS-PW, while PW Segment 2 and\n   PW\
    \ Segment 4 are segments of another MS-PW.  PW segments of the same\n   MS-PW\
    \ (e.g., PW Segment 1 and PW Segment 3) MUST be of the same PW\n   type, and PSN\
    \ tunnels can be of the same or a different technology.\n   An S-PE switches an\
    \ MS-PW from one segment to another based on the PW\n   identifiers (PWid, or\
    \ Attachment Individual Identifier (AII)).  How\n   the PW protocol data units\
    \ (PDUs) are switched at the S-PE depends on\n   the PSN tunnel technology: in\
    \ the case of a Multiprotocol Label\n   Switching (MPLS) PSN to another MPLS PSN,\
    \ PW switching involves a\n   standard MPLS label swap operation.\n   Note that\
    \ although Figure 1 only shows a single S-PE, a PW may\n   transit more than one\
    \ S-PE along its path.  Although [RFC5659]\n   describes MS-PWs that span more\
    \ than one PSN, this document does not\n   specify how the Label Distribution\
    \ Protocol (LDP) is used for PW\n   control [RFC4447] in an inter-AS (Autonomous\
    \ System) environment.\n"
- title: 2.  Applicability
  contents:
  - "2.  Applicability\n   This document describes the case where the PSNs carrying\
    \ the MS-PW\n   are only MPLS PSNs using the Generalized Pseudowire Identifier\
    \ (PWid)\n   Forwarding Equivalence Class (FEC) element (also known as FEC 129).\n\
    \   Interactions with an IP PSN using the Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol\n   version\
    \ 3 (L2TPv3) as described in Section 8 of [RFC6073] are left\n   for further study.\n"
- title: 2.1.  Changes to Existing PW Signaling
  contents:
  - "2.1.  Changes to Existing PW Signaling\n   The procedures described in this document\
    \ make use of existing LDP\n   TLVs and related PW signaling procedures described\
    \ in [RFC4447] and\n   [RFC6073].  The following optional TLV is also defined:\n\
    \   - A Bandwidth TLV to address QoS Signaling requirements (see\n     Section\
    \ 4.2).\n   This document also updates the value of the Length field of the PW\n\
    \   Switching Point PE Sub-TLV Type 0x06 to 14.\n"
- title: 3.  PW Layer 2 Addressing
  contents:
  - "3.  PW Layer 2 Addressing\n   Single-segment pseudowires on an MPLS PSN can use\
    \ attachment circuit\n   identifiers for a PW using FEC 129.  In the case of a\
    \ dynamically\n   placed MS-PW, there is a requirement for the attachment circuit\n\
    \   identifiers to be globally unique, for the purposes of reachability\n   and\
    \ manageability of the PW.  Referencing Figure 1 above, individual\n   globally\
    \ unique addresses MUST be allocated to all the ACs and S-PEs\n   of an MS-PW.\n"

    \                Figure 2: AII Type 2 TLV Structure\n   The fields are defined\
    \ in Section 3.2 of [RFC5003].\n   Addressing schemes based on AII Type 2 permit\
    \ varying levels of AII\n   summarization, thus reducing the scaling burden on\
    \ PW routing.  PW\n   addressing based on AII Type 2 is suitable for point-to-point\n\
    \   provisioning models where auto-discovery of the address at the TT-PE\n   is\
    \ not required.  That is, it is known a priori by provisioning.\n   Implementations\
    \ of the following procedure MUST interpret the AII\n   type to determine the\
    \ meaning of the address format of the AII,\n   irrespective of the number of\
    \ segments in the MS-PW.  All segments of\n   the PW MUST be signaled with the\
    \ same AII type.\n   A unique combination of Global ID, Prefix, and AC ID parts\
    \ of the\n   AII Type 2 are assigned to each AC.  In general, the same Global\
    \ ID\n   and Prefix are be assigned for all ACs belonging to the same T-PE.\n\
    \   This is not a strict requirement, however.  A particular T-PE might\n   have\
    \ more than one Prefix assigned to it, and likewise a fully\n   qualified AII\
    \ with the same Global ID/Prefix but different AC IDs\n   might belong to different\
    \ T-PEs.\n   For the purpose of MS-PWs, the AII MUST be globally unique across\
    \ all\n   PSNs that are spanned by the MS-PW.\n   The AII for a local attachment\
    \ circuit of a given T-PE of an MS-PW\n   and the AII of the corresponding attachment\
    \ circuit on a far-end T-PE\n   (with respect to the LDP signaling) are known\
    \ as the Source\n   Attachment Individual Identifier (SAII) and Target Attachment\n\

    \ the MS-PW.  The procedures in the following sections describe a\n   method to\
    \ extend [RFC6073] by allowing the automatic selection of\n   predefined S-PEs\
    \ and dynamically establishing an MS-PW between two\n   T-PEs.\n"
- title: 4.1.  Pseudowire Routing Procedures
  contents:
  - "4.1.  Pseudowire Routing Procedures\n   The AII Type 2 described above contains\
    \ a Global ID, Prefix, and\n   AC ID.  The TAII is used by S-PEs to determine\
    \ the next SS-PW\n   destination for LDP signaling.\n   Once an S-PE receives\
    \ an MS-PW Label Mapping message containing a\n   TAII with an AII that is not\
    \ locally present, the S-PE performs a\n   lookup in a PW AII routing table. \
    \ If this lookup results in an IP\n   address for the next-hop PE with reachability\
    \ information for the AII\n   in question, then the S-PE will initiate the necessary\
    \ LDP messaging\n   procedure to set up the next PW segment.  If the PW AII routing\
    \ table\n   lookup does not result in an IP address for a next-hop PE, the\n \
    \  destination AII has become unreachable, and the PW setup MUST fail.\n   In\
    \ this case, the next PW segment is considered unprovisioned, and a\n   Label\
    \ Release MUST be returned to the T-PE with a status message of\n   \"AII Unreachable\"\
    .\n   If the TAII of an MS-PW Label Mapping message received by a PE\n   contains\
    \ the Prefix matching the locally provisioned prefix on that\n   PE but an AC\
    \ ID that is not provisioned, then the LDP liberal label\n   retention procedures\
    \ apply, and the Label Mapping message is\n   retained.\n   To allow for dynamic\
    \ end-to-end signaling of MS-PWs, information MUST\n   be present in S-PEs to\
    \ support the determination of the next PW\n   signaling hop.  Such information\
    \ can be provisioned (equivalent to a\n   static route) on each S-PE, or disseminated\
    \ via regular routing\n   protocols (e.g., BGP).\n"

  contents:
  - "4.1.1.  AII PW Routing Table Lookup Aggregation Rules\n   All PEs capable of\

    \ for PW next-hop selection.\n   The PW addressing scheme (AII Type 2 as defined\

    \ is compared against routes\n   from the PW routing table.  Similar to the IPv4\
    \ case, the route with\n   the longest match is selected, determining the next\

  contents:
  - "4.1.2.  PW Static Route\n   For the purpose of determining the next signaling\
    \ hop for a segment\n   of the pseudowire, the PEs MAY be provisioned with fixed-route\n\

    \ path information among\n   S-PEs and T-PEs.  However, T-PEs and S-PEs MAY choose\
    \ to use the\n   Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) [RFC4271] with the Multiprotocol\n\
    \   Extensions as defined in [RFC4760] to propagate PW address\n   information\
    \ throughout the PSN.  PW address information is only\n   propagated by PEs that\
    \ are capable of PW switching.  Therefore, the\n   multiprotocol BGP neighbor\
    \ topology MUST coincide with the topology\n   of T-PEs and S-PEs.\n   Contrary\
    \ to Layer 2 VPN signaling methods that use BGP for\n   auto-discovery [RFC6074],\
    \ in the case of the dynamically placed\n   MS-PW, the source T-PE knows a priori\
    \ (by provisioning) the AC ID on\n   the terminating T-PE that signaling should\
    \ use.  Hence, there is no\n   need to advertise a \"fully qualified\" 96-bit\
    \ address on a per-PW\n   attachment circuit basis.  Only the T-PE Global ID,\
    \ Prefix, and\n   prefix length need to be advertised as part of well-known BGP\n\
    \   procedures; see [RFC4760].\n   Since PW Endpoints are provisioned in the T-PEs,\
    \ the ST-PE will use\n   this information to obtain the first S-PE hop (i.e.,\
    \ first BGP next\n   hop) to where the first PW segment will be established. \
    \ Any\n   subsequent S-PEs will use the same information (i.e., the next BGP\n\
    \   next hop(s)) to obtain the next signaling hop(s) on the path to the\n   TT-PE.\n\
    \   The PW dynamic path Network Layer Reachability Information (NLRI) is\n   advertised\

    \  The Next Hop field of the MP_REACH_NLRI attribute SHALL be\n   interpreted\

  - "4.2.  LDP Signaling\n   The LDP signaling procedures are described in [RFC4447]\
    \ and expanded\n   in [RFC6073].  No new LDP signaling components are required\
    \ for\n   setting up a dynamically placed MS-PW.  However, some optional\n   signaling\
    \ extensions are described below.\n   One of the requirements that MUST be met\
    \ in order to achieve the QoS\n   objectives for a PW on a segment is that a PSN\
    \ tunnel MUST be\n   selected that can support at least the required class of\
    \ service and\n   that has sufficient bandwidth available.\n   Such PSN tunnel\
    \ selection can be achieved where the next hop for a PW\n   segment is explicitly\
    \ configured at each PE, whether the PE is a T-PE\n   or an S-PE in the case of\
    \ a segmented PW, without dynamic path\n   selection (as per [RFC6073]).  In these\
    \ cases, it is possible to\n   explicitly configure the bandwidth required for\
    \ a PW so that the T-PE\n   or S-PE can reserve that bandwidth on the PSN tunnel.\n\
    \   Where dynamic path selection is used and the next hop is therefore\n   not\

    \ the bandwidth for the PW from the T-PE to the S-PEs is\n   required.  This is\

    \  The forward SENDER_TSPEC\n   refers to the data path in the direction ST-PE\

    \ determined, a\n   T/S-PE SHOULD reference the forward SENDER_TSPEC object to\
    \ determine\n   an appropriate PSN tunnel towards the next signaling hop.  If\
    \ such a\n   tunnel exists, the MS-PW signaling procedures are invoked with the\n\
    \   inclusion of the PW Bandwidth TLV.  When the PE searches for a PSN\n   tunnel,\
    \ any tunnel that points to a next hop equivalent to the next\n   hop selected\
    \ will be included in the search (the LDP address TLV is\n   used to determine\
    \ the next-hop equivalence).\n   When an S/T-PE receives a PW Bandwidth TLV, once\
    \ the PW next hop is\n   selected, the S/T-PE MUST request the appropriate resources\
    \ from the\n   PSN.  The resources described in the reverse SENDER_TSPEC are\n\
    \   allocated from the PSN toward the originator of the message or\n   previous\
    \ hop.  When resources are allocated from the PSN for a\n   specific PW, the allocation\
    \ SHOULD account for the resource usage of\n   the PW.\n   In the case where PSN\
    \ resources towards the previous hop are not\n   available, the following procedure\
    \ MUST be followed:\n     i. The PSN MAY allocate more QoS resources, e.g., bandwidth,\
    \ to the\n        PSN tunnel.\n    ii. The S-PE MAY attempt to set up another\
    \ PSN tunnel to accommodate\n        the new PW QoS requirements.\n   iii. If\
    \ the S-PE cannot get enough resources to set up the segment in\n        the MS-PW,\
    \ a Label Release MUST be returned to the previous hop\n        with a status\
    \ message of \"Bandwidth resources unavailable\".\n   In the latter case, the\
    \ T-PE receiving the status message MUST also\n   withdraw the corresponding PW\
    \ Label Mapping message for the opposite\n   direction if it has already been\
    \ successfully set up.\n   If an ST-PE receives a Label Mapping message, the following\
    \ procedure\n   MUST be followed:\n   If the ST-PE has already sent a Label Mapping\
    \ message for this PW,\n   then the ST-PE MUST check to see if this Label Mapping\
    \ message\n   originated from the same LDP peer to which the corresponding Label\n\
    \   Mapping message for this particular PW was sent.  If it is the same\n   peer,\
    \ the PW is established.  If it is a different peer, then the\n   ST-PE MUST send\
    \ a Label Release message with a status code of \"PW\n   Loop Detected\" to the\
    \ PE that originated the LDP Label Mapping\n   message.\n   If the PE has not\
    \ yet sent a Label Mapping message for this\n   particular PW, then it MUST send\
    \ the Label Mapping message to this\n   LDP peer, regardless of what the PW TAII\
    \ routing lookup result is.\n"
