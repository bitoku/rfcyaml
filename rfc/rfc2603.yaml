  - "Abstract\n   This memo defines how ILMI-based Server Discovery, which provides
    a\n   method for ATM-attached hosts and routers to dynamically determine\n   the
    ATM addresses of servers, shall be used to locate NHRP servers.\n"
  title: Abstract
- contents:
  - "1. Introduction\n   Presently, configuring a host or router to use NHRP [1] is
    cumbersome\n   and error-prone since it requires at least one ATM address to be\n
    \  statically configured on each host or router in the network.\n   Further, it
    is impossible to implement a diskless host to use NHRP\n   since local configuration
    is required.  ILMI-based Server Discovery,\n   hereafter referred to as \"server
    discovery,\" provides a solution to\n   these problems.\n   A brief overview of
    the Integrated Local Management Interface (ILMI)\n   and the Service Registry
    MIB, as defined by the ATM Forum, are\n   provided in this memo. The reader should
    consult [2] for a complete\n   description of ILMI and this MIB, but the information
    contained here\n   is sufficient for an understanding of its use to support NHRP
    server\n   discovery.\n"
  title: 1. Introduction
- contents:
  - "2. Integrated Local Management Interface\n   The Integrated Local Management
    Interface (ILMI) [2] provides a\n   mechanism for ATM-attached devices, such as
    hosts, routers, and ATM\n   switches, to transfer management information. It is
    based on the\n   Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP), Version 1, and supports\n
    \  get, get-next, set and trap operations.\n   The ILMI specification designates
    the switch side of the ATM link as\n   the 'network side' and the host/router
    side of the ATM link as the '\n   user side.' The Service Registry MIB, which
    is outlined in Section 3,\n   is implmented on the network side and is queried
    from the user side.\n"

  - "3. ILMI 4.0 Service Registry MIB\n   Server discovery utilizes the Service Registry
    MIB defined by the ATM\n   Forum in ILMI Specification Version 4.0 [2]. To support
    the existing\n   framework for IP over ATM, ATM switches must support the Service\n
    \  Registry MIB.\n   A row in the service registry table [2] is defined as:\n
    \     AtmfSrvcRegEntry ::= SEQUENCE {\n          atmfSrvcRegPort          INTEGER,\n
    \         atmfSrvcRegServiceID     OBJECT IDENTIFIER,\n          atmfSrvcRegATMAddress
    \   AtmAddress,\n          atmfSrvcRegAddressIndex  INTEGER,\n          atmfSrvcRegParm1
    \        OCTET STRING\n      }\n   The definition of each field in this structure
    is:\n      atmfSrvcRegPort - The ATM port number for which this entry\n          contains
    management information. The value of zero may be used\n          to indicate the
    ATM interface over which a management request\n          was received.\n      atmfSrvcRegServiceID
    - This is the service identifier that\n          uniquely identifies the type
    of service at the address\n          provided in the table. (See Section 3.2 for
    NHRP OID.)\n      atmfSrvcRegATMAddress - This is the full address of the service.\n
    \         The ATM client will use this address to establish a connection\n          with
    the service.\n      atmfSrvcRegAddressIndex - An arbitrary integer to differentiate\n
    \         multiple rows containing different ATM addresses for the same\n          service
    on the same port.\n      atmfSrvcRegParm1 - An octet string whose size and meaning
    is\n          determined by the value of atmfSrvcRegServiceID.\n   The service
    registry table is indexed by atmfSrvcRegPort,\n   atmfSrvcRegServiceID and atmfSrvcRegAddressIndex.\n"

    - "3.1 Service Parameter String\n   A generic parameter string is defined in the
      service registry table,\n   thus allowing protocol-specific parameters to be
      specified. To be\n   consistent with [1], the parameter string for NHRP shall
      be:\n       ar$pro.type   16   bits     Protocol type\n       ar$pro.snap   40
      \  bits     Optional extension to protocol type\n       ar$plen        8   bits

      address\n       ar$mask       plen octets   Network mask\n   Where\n       ar$pro.type
      \  - See [1]. (IPv4 is 0x0800, IPv6 is 0x86DD)\n       ar$pro.snap   - See [1].
      (IPv4 and IPv6 are 0)\n       ar$plen       - Length of the protocol address.\n
      \                       (IPv4 is 4, IPv6 is 16)\n       ar$addr       - Network
      address represented in network byte\n                        order\n       ar$mask
      \      - Network mask represented in network byte order\n"

  - "4. Next Hop Client Behavior\n   An Next Hop Client NHC) will access the service
    registry table via\n   ILMI using the SNMP GetNext operator to \"sweep\" (SNMP
    parlance for a\n   linear search) beginning with {Port = 0, ServiceID = <see Section\n
    \  3.2>, Index = 0} while holding the port number and the serviceID\n   constant.
    (Port number 0 is used within ILMI to indicate \"this\n   port.\")\n   An NHC
    with no local configuration, such as a diskless workstation,\n   must use the
    row with the lowest index value if multiple Next Hop\n   Server (NHS), possibly
    for multiple networks, are listed.\n   NHC that have local IP configuration must
    use a row that has the\n   appropriate IP address.  For example, consider the
    case where an IP\n   router has 3 logical interfaces defined on a single physical\n
    \  interface with IP addresses 1.0.0.1/8, 128.10.0.1/16 and\n   171.69.150.226/24.
    The router will sweep the service registry table\n   looking for rows that have
    atmfSrvcRegParm1 values as shown below:\n     Net number/mask  atmfSrvcRegParm1\n
    \    ---------------- --------------------------------------------------\n     1.0.0.0/8
    \       08 00 00 00 00 00 00  04  01 00 00 00  ff 00 00 00\n     128.10.0.0/16
    \   08 00 00 00 00 00 00  04  80 0a 00 00  ff ff 00 00\n     171.69.150.0/24  08
    00 00 00 00 00 00  04  ab 45 96 00  ff ff ff 00\n   When the correct atmfSrvcRegParm1
    values are located, the router may\n   then establish an SVC to the selected NHS
    and perform the appropriate\n   protocol operations.\n   Redundant NHS are supported
    with multiple rows in the service\n   registry table. This list of NHS is ordered
    with the primary NHS\n   having the lowest index value. The NHC must attempt to
    utilize the\n   primary NHS before utilizing a secondary NHS. Administrators must\n
    \  ensure that the listed NHS are synchronized.\n"

    The NHS may\n   retrieve the NHRP service registry data to validate the results.

    way.\n"

    Augmented Routing,\" or PAR) [3] has\n   been developed by the ATM Forum. PAR
    can distribute data such as NHS\n   addresses. Further, the ATM Forum is developing
    a proxy mechanism for\n   PAR (Proxy PAR) that would allow a UNI-attached host
    or router to\n   access PAR data without a full PAR implementation.\n   These
    mechanisms offer a promising way to manage the service registry\n   tables maintained
    on each switch in an ATM network, yet would not\n   require changes to the mechanism
    defined in this memo. Hosts and\n   routers can continue to utilize ILMI-based
    or Proxy PAR-based server\n   discovery and network administrators could manage
    the service\n   registry data with local configuration or via PAR and Proxy PAR.\n"
  title: 6. Relationship with PNNI Augmented Routing

  - "7. Security Considerations\n   The server discovery mechanism is built on the
    ILMI managment\n   framework and the security embodied in that framework. Access,
    to\n   user- or network-side information is controlled by MIB design rather\n
    \  than protocol security mechanisms.\n   The service registery MIB, the table
    containing information for\n   server discovery, is defined in [2] with read-only
    access. This means\n   that any user-side device may query the service registry,
    but may not\n   modify the service registry via ILMI. Instead, the sevice registry\n
    \  table must be modified via local configuration on the ATM switch.\n"
