  - "1. Introduction\n   A meeting was held at Bolt Beranek and Newman on 23-24 July\
    \ 1984 to\n   discuss recent progress by groups who are building multimedia mail\n\
    \   systems and to discuss a variety of issues related to the further\n   development\
    \ of multimedia systems.  Representatives were present from\n   BBN, ISI, SRI\
    \ and Linkabit.  The list of attendees appears at the end\n   of this note.\n\
    \   The result of this meeting is a series of agreements that will be\n   incorporated\
    \ in the next set of experiments with multimedia mail as\n   well as a set of\
    \ items for further action.\n   Note: There are references in this document to\
    \ notes in a series\n   devoted to multimedia mail.  These notes are available\

    \ text, voice and graphics.\n   Another effort at SRI involves integration of\
    \ applications to run in\n   the ADDCOMPE testbed.  Diamond will be the first\
    \ example of an\n   application which uses multimedia data in the testbed.  SRI\

  contents:
  - "3.1. Conversion to the New Multimedia Syntax\n   There was general agreement\
    \ that in future experiments we would all\n   adopt the revised syntax for multimedia\
    \ mail as described in the\n   Final Report to SRI Project 5363.  It was agreed\
    \ that RFC767 should\n   be revised to reflect these changes.  The timing for\
    \ switching over\n   should be as soon as possible and should be completed by\
    \ October 1,\n   1984.\n"
- title: 3.2. Graphics Representation
  contents:
  - "3.2. Graphics Representation\n   A wide ranging discussion on the way in which\
    \ graphics is to be\n   represented in multimedia documents occurred.  It was\
    \ generally\n   agreed that the first style of graphical object to be included\
    \ in\n   multimedia messages would be a simple line-drawing, such as those\n \
    \  that can be produced by the many \"draw\" programs (e.g. LisaDraw)\n   currently\
    \ in existence.  Attention was focused on the two existing\n   standards (ACM-CORE\
    \ and GKS) and the interim protocol used in the\n   Diamond system.  Two major\
    \ problems with the existing standards were\n   mentioned:\n      o In both ACM-CORE\
    \ and GKS grouping is inadequate or non-existent.\n        This means that it\
    \ is difficult or impossible to build up a\n        composition of several graphical\
    \ objects and then manipulate\n        that composite as a single graphical object.\n\
    \      o Neither ACM-CORE or GKS have specified a standard method for\n      \
    \  representing graphical drawings in memory (e.g. long term file\n        storage).\
    \  This is one of the most important aspects of a\n        graphical standard\
    \ for multimedia mail.  The focus of graphical\n        standards so far has been\
    \ towards driving devices in a\n        independent manner, not storing graphics\
    \ in a standard\n        representation.\n   A presentation of the representation\
    \ for graphical objects in Diamond\n   was given.  The protocol is documented\
    \ in MMM-18 and MMM-23.\n   Requests for hardcopies of the diagrams in those documents\
    \ (sigh) can\n   be sent to Travers@BBN.\n   The discussion then focused on the\
    \ level of effort required to switch\n   from one representation to another. \
    \ It was generally agreed that\n   compared to the entire editor used to manipulate\
    \ graphical objects\n   (e.g., the \"draw\" program), the part that reads or writes\
    \ objects\n   from or to files is relatively simple.  Most draw programs have\
    \ a\n   unique internal representation which is built when reading the file\n\
    \   representation and used as the source when writing the file\n"

    \ portion of a graphics\n   editor which is impacted by switching from one file\
    \ representation to\n   another.  Thus it seemed that the approach of adopting\
    \ one interim\n   representation now and planning to switch to a standard\n  \
    \ representation when work on the standards solve the problems noted\n   above\
    \ was reasonable.\n   After considerable examination of the issues, the following\

- title: 3.3. Document Presentation Semantics
  contents:
  - "3.3. Document Presentation Semantics\n   There was a presentation of the ideas\
    \ contained in MMM-22: \"A Format\n   for the Construction of Multimedia Messages\"\
    .  The resulting\n   discussion addressed the following issues:\n      o Presentation\
    \ of documents on display devices with different\n        characteristics (dimensions,\
    \ resolutions, available fonts,\n        etc.).\n         The essence of the conversation\
    \ was that there is no single set\n         of fonts, or page sizes that will\
    \ cover all of the\n         possibilities. There was a strong feeling that as\
    \ long as the\n         display surface was of reasonable size that a document\
    \ should\n         be presented in a \"correctly\" formatted manner.  Rather than\n\
    \         the originator of a document specifying hard page boundaries,\n    \
    \     the intent of the originator regarding formatting and grouping\n       \
    \  of objects in the document should be preserved and used when\n         the\
    \ document is actually presented on a display device.  A\n         window on a\
    \ bitmap display and a hardcopy page printer are both\n         examples of display\
    \ devices.\n      o The desire to represent the kinds of documents that currently\n\
    \        exist in the world of hardcopy as well as to represent documents\n  \
    \      that can take advantage of the new possibilities of electronic\n      \
    \  creation, storage and presentation.\n"

  - "Multimedia Mail Meeting Notes\n   Several points were made:\n      1. One of\
    \ the first goals for multimedia systems should be to\n         represent the\
    \ types of documents that are prevalent in the\n         hardcopy world.  People\
    \ are already familiar with these\n         documents and will expect multimedia\
    \ systems to, at least, be\n         able to deal with them.\n      2. In an effort\
    \ to provide the capabilities of electronically\n         originated documents\
    \ based on the hardcopy model of documents,\n         we should not eliminate\
    \ the great potential of electronic\n         documents that have much greater\
    \ reactive qualities.  For\n         example, a document where a graphical figure\
    \ and a textual\n         explanation of that figure are linked so that as long\
    \ as the\n         explanation is being read the figure is visible.\n      3.\
    \ In many situations being able to carry away a paper copy of a\n         document\
    \ is a requirement even if the document was not\n         primarily intended to\
    \ be presented in hardcopy.\n   The following agreements were made:\n      1.\
    \ A method for recording the author's intent regarding the\n         presentation\
    \ of a document should be developed.  This\n         representation would defer\
    \ decisions on final presentation\n         bindings of size, resolution and fonts\
    \ to the reader's document\n         presenter.\n         Topics addressed by\
    \ this representation will include:\n            o Grouping of objects\n     \
    \       o Limited Font attributes (e.g., normal, bold, italic)\n            o\
    \ Headings, Footings\n            o Sectioning\n         Of course the reader's\
    \ document presenter is free to ignore any\n         of the author's intentions\
    \ it cannot deal with.  The point of\n         this representation is to record\
    \ the author's desires but to\n         defer final decisions on how to use the\
    \ intentions until the\n         capabilities of the reader are known.\n     \
    \    This representation will lie some where between the rather\n         loose\

    \ all of the\n         issues addressed by modern document formatting systems.\n\

    \  perhaps limit the flexibility present in these complex\n         formatting\

    \       relationships between objects that make use of the capabilities\n    \
    \     of electronic document presentation, such as simultaneous\n         presentation\
    \ (i.e., two objects which are visible at the same\n         time) and overlay\
    \ presentation (i.e., two (possibly\n         transparent) objects which occupy\

- title: 3.5. New Media Types
  contents:
  - "3.5. New Media Types\n   The discussion dealt with three topics:  A proposal\
    \ for a new media\n   type, ideas for other new media types and provisions for\
    \ dealing with\n   unknown media types.\n   A description of the Diamond SpreadSheet/Chart\
    \ media type was\n   presented.  This is documented in MMM-24.  In this media\
    \ it is\n   possible to represent a table containing numbers, labels, dates and\n\
    \   formulas.  A unique attribute of this media type is that the\n   spreadsheet\
    \ model as well as the data are transmitted.  The reader of\n   a document containing\
    \ a spreadsheet object can test what effect\n   different data would have on conclusions\
    \ suggested by the spreadsheet\n   object.  A spreadsheet may appear as a table\
    \ and/or one of several\n   alternative business charts (line graph, scatter graph,\
    \ bar chart or\n   pie chart).  Rulings may be added to the tabular representation\
    \ so\n   that it is possible to achieve the appearance of sophisticated\n   tabular\
    \ data presentation.  During the discussion, the point was made\n   that a minimal\
    \ implementation of the spreadsheet object could ignore\n   the formulas and just\
    \ present the values of the cells, thus allowing\n   a minimal presentation of\
    \ the tabular and chart information.\n   Ideas for new media types included:\n\
    \      Form\n         A set of fields which are Name-Value pairs.  Forms can be\
    \ used\n         for presentation and/or acceptance of information. The act of\n\
    \         filling out a form might be used (under user approval) to\n        \
    \ trigger sending the completed form to the appropriate person\n         who handles\
    \ such forms.\n      Animated Graphics\n         A line drawing that has temporal\
    \ information encoded in the\n         presentation of its components.  The idea\
    \ is that parts of a\n         graphics object could move about the object during\
    \ its\n         presentation.  For example, an arrow could move about a map\n\
    \         showing a route to be followed.  There was some discussion\n       \
    \  about how this would interact with other media.  For example,\n         how\
    \ could an arrow moving about a map be coordinated with voice\n         instructions\
    \ on how to get from one place to another.  There\n         were no decisions\
    \ about how best to accomplish this.\n   Finally, we agreed that all of our systems\
    \ should be prepared to\n   accept (and possibly ignore) media types that are\
    \ not currently\n   implemented.  The common way of dealing with this is to include\
    \ a\n   statement of the form \"An object of type <Type> appears here\".  With\n"

    \ of every\n   object was discussed.  There are several uses of such a caption:\n\
    \      o For media like voice which do not have an implicit visual\n        representation,\
    \ it is useful to include a caption indicating\n        something about the object.\
    \  This caption can serve as a visual\n        indication of the presence of the\
    \ non-visual object.\n"

  - "Multimedia Mail Meeting Notes\n      o When an implementation of a multimedia\
    \ message system doesn't\n        support a given media type, it can be useful\
    \ to give some\n        information about the object in the form of a text passage.\n\
    \      o In some situations, it is important to present an outline of a\n    \
    \    document.  Captions associated with each object could be used to\n      \
    \  generate a shortened abstract of the document.\n   We agreed to add to all\
    \ object types an optional property whose name\n   is \"Caption\" and whose value\
    \ is of type Text String.\n"
- title: 3.9. More Users of Multimedia Mail
  contents:
  - "3.9. More Users of Multimedia Mail\n   We need to increase the use of multimedia\
    \ mail to gain more\n   experience with issues that need attention.  This can\
    \ be done by:\n      o Encouraging more sites to participate in the experiments.\
    \  There\n        are several possible sites which have Sun workstations that\n\
    \        could be configured to run an MPM and one of the multimedia\n       \
    \ message systems.\n      o Making the MPMs perform translations to and from SMTP\
    \ text-only\n        mail.  At BBN, the Diamond Import/Export component performs\n\
    \        translations in both directions and this has proved very useful\n   \
    \     in testing the operation of our system.  In addition, the\n        inclusion\
    \ of statements such as <Graphics appears here> might\n        spark interest\
    \ from text-only mail recipients, although care\n        should be taken not to\
    \ offend anybody with this kind of \"class\n        differentiation\".\n   To\
    \ the extent possible, the Sun Workstation MPM will be modified to\n   perform\
    \ translations to and from SMTP mail.  The TOPS-20 MPM already\n   does the translation\
    \ from multimedia mail to text-only mail.  It may\n   be possible to add translation\
    \ in the other direction.\n"
