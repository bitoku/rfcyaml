- title: 1.  Existing BGP-Triggered Black-holing Techniques
  contents:
  - "1.  Existing BGP-Triggered Black-holing Techniques\n   Current BGP-triggered\
    \ black-holing techniques rely on altering the\n   BGP next hop address of a network\
    \ targeted by an attack throughout\n   the iBGP network.  A customized iBGP advertisement\
    \ is generated from\n   a router participating in the destination/attacked AS\
    \ where the next\n   hop address for the targeted network or host is modified\
    \ to point to\n   an RFC 1918 [RFC1918] (private internet) address.  Most routers\
    \ on\n   the Internet, especially edge routers, have static routes pointing\n\
    \   RFC 1918 addresses to the null interface.  Those static routes drive\n   all\
    \ traffic destined to the network under attack to the null\n   interface.\n  \
    \ When an iBGP-speaking router inside the destination AS receives the\n   iBGP\
    \ update, the advertised prefix will be added to the routing table\n   with a\
    \ next hop of one of the networks listed in RFC 1918.  The\n   router will then\
    \ attempt to resolve the RFC 1918 next-hop in order to\n   qualify the route and\
    \ derive a forwarding interface.  This process\n   will return a valid next hop\
    \ as the null interface.  Assuming the\n   router is properly configured to direct\
    \ RFC 1918 destined traffic to\n   a null interface, traffic destined to the attacked\
    \ network gets\n   dropped, making the attacked network unreachable to the attacker\
    \ and\n   everyone else.\n   While this technique shields the internal infrastructure\
    \ from the\n   attack, protecting a large number of devices, it has the undesirable\n\
    \   side effect of rendering the targeted/attacked network unreachable\n   throughout\
    \ the entire destination AS.  Even if a static route\n   pointing an RFC 1918\
    \ address to a null interface is not configured on\n   all routers within the\
    \ destination AS, the modified next hop makes\n   the traffic un-routable to its\
    \ legitimate destination.\n   Network operators usually use the BGP-triggered\
    \ black holes for a\n   short period of time.  The technique causes traffic drops\
    \ on all\n   ingress points of the AS for traffic destined to the attacked\n \
    \  network.  By default, routers dropping traffic into a null interface\n   should\
    \ send an \"ICMP unreachable\" message to the source address\n   belonging to\
    \ the origin/attacking AS.\n   Once the procedure reaches this point, one of the\
    \ source addresses of\n   the attack traffic is hijacked by introducing a device\
    \ with the same\n   source IP address into the BGP domain of the destination/attacked\
    \ AS.\n   The device hijacking the source address collects the ICMP unreachable\n\
    \   packets.  The source addresses of these ICMP unreachable packets\n   reveal\
    \ which edge routers within the destination/attacked AS the\n   attack is coming\
    \ from.  The network operator may then opt to manually\n   stop the traffic on\
    \ the routers from which attack traffic is\n   entering.\n"
- title: 2.  Enhanced BGP-Triggered Black-holing Technique
  contents:
  - "2.  Enhanced BGP-Triggered Black-holing Technique\n   This paper describes a\
    \ technique developed to instruct a selected set\n   of routers to alter the next\
    \ hop address of a particular prefix by\n   use of the BGP protocol.  The next\
    \ hop can either be a null interface\n   or, as discussed later on in this paper,\
    \ a sinkhole tunnel interface.\n   This technique does not invoke an access list\
    \ or rate limiting\n   statement to treat attack traffic, nor does it involve\
    \ a network wide\n   change of the attacked prefix next hop address.  The next\
    \ hop will\n   only be changed on a selection of routers with the aid of BGP\n\
    \   communities within the destination/attacked AS.\n   To prepare the network\
    \ for this technique, the network operator needs\n   to define a unique community\
    \ value for each destination AS border\n   router that could potentially drive\
    \ attack traffic to the victim.\n   For example, a network with a BGP autonomous\
    \ system number 65001 has\n   two border routers (R1 and R2).  Community value\
    \ 65001:1 is assigned\n   to identify R1, community value 65001:2 is assigned\
    \ to identify R2,\n   and community value 65001:666 is assigned to identify both\
    \ R1 and R2.\n   After the BGP community assignment, R1 and R2 must be configured\
    \ with\n   the following:\n   1. Static route pointing an RFC 1918 network to\
    \ a null interface.\n   2. AS-Path access list that matches local BGP prefix advertisement.\n\
    \   3. BGP community access list to match the community value assigned by\n  \
    \    the network operator for the particular router (i.e., 65001:1 for\n     \
    \ R1).\n   4. BGP community access list to match the community value assigned\
    \ by\n      the network operator for all routers (i.e., 65001:666 for R1 and\n\
    \      R2)\n   5. Under the BGP process, an iBGP import route policy should be\n\
    \      applied on received iBGP advertisements to do the following logic.\n  \
    \    (Statements are in a logical AND order)\n      a. A policy statement to permit\
    \ routes that match the following\n         criteria and apply the following changes.\n\
    \         i.   Match for a community specific to that router (i.e.,\n        \
    \      65001:1, for R1).\n         ii.  Match the AS-Path to locally generated\
    \ BGP advertisements.\n         iii. Set the BGP next hop to an RFC 1918 network.\n\
    \         iv.  Overwrite the BGP community with the well-known community\n   \
    \           (no-advertise).\n      b. A policy statement to permit routes that\
    \ match the following\n         criteria and apply the following changes.\n  \
    \       i.   Match for a community that covers all routers (i.e.,\n          \
    \    65001:666).\n         ii.  Match the AS-Path to locally generated BGP advertisements.\n\
    \         iii. Set the BGP next hop to an RFC 1918 network.\n         iv.  Overwrite\
    \ the BGP community with the well-known community\n              (no-advertise).\n\
    \   After the policies have been configured on R1 and R2, the network\n   operator\
    \ can, in the case of an attack, advertise the targeted\n   network that could\
    \ be one or more /32 \"host\" routes into iBGP of the\n   destination/attacked\
    \ AS.  The advertisement must contain the\n   community value associated with\
    \ the router(s) where the attack is\n   arriving in addition to the well-known\
    \ community (no-export).  Using\n   BGP communities preserves the original next\
    \ hop address of the\n   targeted network on all routers where the special route\
    \ policy\n   configuration is not present.  iBGP will then carry the prefix\n\
    \   advertisement to all routers in the destination/attacked AS.  All\n   routers\
    \ within the destination AS, except the ones that match the\n   community stamped\
    \ on the prefix, will be oblivious to the community\n   value and will install\
    \ the network route with the legitimate next hop\n   address.  Routers that match\
    \ the community will also install the\n   network route into their routing table\
    \ but will alter the next hop\n   address to an RFC 1918 network and then to a\
    \ null interface as per\n   the route policies configuration and recursive route\
    \ lookup.  The\n   reason for matching locally announced networks is to make sure\
    \ that\n   no eBGP peer can misuse this community to drive any network to a null\n\
    \   interface.  Blackholing the targeted/attacked hosts is recommended,\n   but\
    \ not the entire address block they belong to so that the blackhole\n   effect\
    \ has the minimum impact on the attacked network.\n   This technique stops traffic\
    \ from getting forwarded to the legitimate\n   destination on routers identified\
    \ as transit routers for attack\n   traffic and that have route map matches for\
    \ the community value\n   associated with the network advertisement.  All other\
    \ traffic on the\n   network will still get forwarded to the legitimate destination\
    \ thus\n   minimizing the impact on the targeted network.\n"
- title: 3.  Sinkhole Tunnels
  contents:
  - "3.  Sinkhole Tunnels\n   Following the \"Enhanced BGP-Triggered Black-holing\
    \ Technique\", it may\n   become a requirement to take a look at the attack traffic\
    \ for further\n   analysis.  This requirement adds to the complexity of the exercise.\n\
    \   Usually with broadcast interfaces, network operators install network\n   sniffers\
    \ on a spanned port of a switch for analysis of traffic.\n   Another method would\
    \ be to announce a network prefix that covers the\n   attack host address into\
    \ iBGP, altering the next hop into a sinkhole\n   device that can log traffic\
    \ for analysis.  The latter technique\n   results in taking down the services\
    \ offered on the targeted/attacked\n   IP addresses.  Inter-AS traffic will be\
    \ sucked into the sinkhole,\n   along with Intra-AS traffic.  Packet level analysis\
    \ involves\n   redirecting traffic away from the destination host to a sniffer\
    \ or a\n   router.  As a result, if the traffic being examined includes\n   legitimate\
    \ traffic, that legitimate traffic will never make it to the\n   destination host.\
    \  This will result in denial of service for the\n   legitimate traffic.\n   A\
    \ better alternative would be to use a sinkhole tunnel.  A sinkhole\n   tunnel\
    \ is implemented at all possible entry points from which attacks\n   can pass\
    \ into the destination/attacked AS.  Using the BGP community\n   technique, traffic\
    \ destined to the attacked/targeted host could be\n   re-routed to a special path\
    \ (tunnel) where a sniffer could capture\n   the traffic for analysis.  After\
    \ being analyzed, traffic will exit\n   the tunnel and be routed normally to the\
    \ destination host.  In other\n   words, the traffic will pass through the network\
    \ to a sniffer without\n   altering the next hop information of the destination\
    \ network.  All\n   routers within the destination/attacked AS iBGP domain will\
    \ have the\n   proper next hop address.  Only the entry point router will have\
    \ the\n   altered next hop information.\n   To detail the procedure, a sinkhole\
    \ router with an optional sniffer\n   attached to its interface is installed and\
    \ configured to participate\n   in the IGP and iBGP of the attacked AS.  Next,\
    \ a tunnel is created,\n   using MPLS Traffic Engineering as an example, from\
    \ all border routers\n   attacks can potentially enter from (Inter-AS traffic)\
    \ to the sinkhole\n   router.  When a host or network is under attack, a customized\
    \ iBGP\n   advertisement is sent to announce the network address of the attacked\n\
    \   host(s) with the proper next hop that insures traffic will reach\n   those\
    \ hosts or networks.  The customized advertisement will also have\n   a community\
    \ string value that matches the set of border routers the\n   attack is entering\
    \ from, as described in section 2.  The new next hop\n   address configured within\
    \ the route policy section of all border\n   routers should be the sinkhole IP\
    \ address.  This IP address belongs\n   to the /30 subnet assigned to the tunnel\
    \ connecting the border router\n   to the sinkhole router.\n   Routers that do\
    \ not have a match for the community string will do\n   regular routing.  Lack\
    \ of a community string match on these routers\n   will insure that the special\
    \ route policy does not change the next\n   hop address.  Traffic entering from\
    \ border routers that do not have a\n   match to the special community will pass\
    \ through regular router\n   interfaces to the legitimate destination.  It might\
    \ also be required\n   to allow the traffic to reach its destination after being\
    \ captured.\n   In this case, a default network route is configured to point to\
    \ any\n   interface attached and configured on the iBGP network.  This would\n\
    \   also include the same physical interface the tunnel is built on.\n   Since\
    \ the next hop address is not changed on the sinkhole device,\n   traffic entering\
    \ this device from the tunnel will be sent back to the\n   network due to the\
    \ presence of the default route.  Routing protocols\n   will then take care of\
    \ properly routing the traffic to its original\n   destination (attacked network).\n\
    \   It becomes apparent that this technique can also be used for purposes\n  \
    \ other than analyzing attack traffic.  Legitimate traffic could also\n   be pulled\
    \ out of normal routing into a tunnel and then reinserted\n   into the backbone\
    \ without altering the next hop addressing scheme\n   throughout the iBGP network.\n\
    \   MPLS Traffic Engineering with its many features, is a good method of\n   sliding\
    \ traffic to the sinkhole device.  Features like QoS policies\n   can be applied\
    \ on the attack traffic, thus preventing it from\n   competing on resources with\
    \ legitimate traffic.\n   To be able to alter the next hop on the border router,\
    \ a subnet of an\n   RFC 1918 network is statically routed to the tunnel interface.\
    \  An\n   example of the static route is:\n      ip route 192.168.0.12 255.255.255.255\
    \ Tunnel0\n   Setting the next hop of the target IP address to 192.168.0.12/32\
    \ will\n   force the traffic to go through the tunnel.\n   Traffic is received\
    \ at the sinkhole interface via the TE tunnel.\n   Subsequently, three methods\
    \ could be installed, namely rate-limiting\n   policies, QoS policies, and access\
    \ lists.  These policies could rate\n   limit or drop traffic classified as attack\
    \ traffic.  This process\n   would be completed on the interface of the sinkhole\
    \ device.  Another\n   useful application for a sinkhole router is to pull in\
    \ traffic via\n   tunnels to an inbound interface and have a default route statement\n\
    \   forwarding the traffic out to an Ethernet interface.  The Ethernet\n   interface\
    \ is connected to the iBGP network and guarantees proper\n   delivery of traffic\
    \ however, it still allows the use of a packet\n   sniffer to further analyze\
    \ the attack traffic.\n   This becomes very useful when it is not feasible to\
    \ apply an Access\n   list or a rate limiting statement on the BGP border router\
    \ or last\n   hop router before the attacked host or network because of hardware\
    \ or\n   software limitations.  Hence, instead of upgrading interfaces at the\n\
    \   point of entry of attack traffic, the latter could be pulled into the\n  \
    \ sinkhole and treated on that device.  Operational costs can be\n   rendered\
    \ minimal if the sinkhole router is a powerful device.\n"
