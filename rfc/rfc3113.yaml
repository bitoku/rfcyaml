  - "1. Conventions used in this document\n   This document uses significant terminology\
    \ that is specialized to\n   IETF, 3GPP, or their areas of work.  See Appendix\

  contents:
  - "2. Introduction\n   This document contains a set of principles and guidelines\
    \ that serves\n   as the basis for establishing the collaboration between 3GPP\
    \ and\n   IETF, with the objective of securing timely development of technical\n\
    \   specification that facilitate maximum interoperability with existing\n   (fixed\
    \ and mobile) Internet systems, devices, and protocols.\n   Each organization\
    \ will operate according to their own rules and\n   procedures including rules\
    \ governing IPR policy, specification\n   elaboration, approval and maintenance.\n"

- title: 3.1 3GPP use of IETF Internet Standards
  contents:
  - "3.1 3GPP use of IETF Internet Standards\n   In the further development of 3GPP\
    \ specifications, the benefit of\n   adopting Internet specifications has been\
    \ identified.\n   The preferred 3GPP approach is to use the Internet standards\n\
    \   unchanged, if feasible.  In any case, 3GPP has no intention to\n   duplicate\
    \ work performed in IETF.\n   However, while this document recognizes the importance\
    \ of 3GPP\n   interoperability with the existing Internet and hence the use of\
    \ IETF\n   standards, 3GPP recognizes that additions or modifications might be\n\
    \   needed in order to make the IETF internet specification fulfill the\n   needs\
    \ of 3GPP.  In such cases, 3GPP will take its concerns directly\n   to the appropriate\
    \ IETF working groups for resolution, or to an\n   appropriate Area Director if\
    \ no appropriate working group can be\n   found.\n"
- title: 3.2 IETF access to 3GPP Wireless expertise
  contents:
  - "3.2 IETF access to 3GPP Wireless expertise\n   The technical work in 3GPP is\
    \ organized in Technical Specification\n   Groups TSGs each with their area of\
    \ responsibilities.  TSG-RAN and\n   TSG-GERAN are responsible for the Radio Access\
    \ networks based on\n   UTRAN and GERAN and thus the experts in the areas of the\n\
    \   characteristics of the physical transport.  TSG CN is responsible for\n  \
    \ the Mobility Management and other core network protocol and\n   functionalities.\
    \  TSG-T is responsible for Terminal aspects and\n   applications.  TSG-SA is\
    \ responsible for the service and system\n   aspects including the overall architecture,\
    \ security and O&M aspects.\n   Contacts for the TSGs can be found on the 3GPP\
    \ web-site\n   http://www.3gpp.org/.\n"
- title: 4. Document Sharing
  contents:
  - "4. Document Sharing\n   Both 3GPP and IETF encourage the sharing of draft documents\
    \ that are\n   of mutual interest.\n   3GPP documents are available on its official\
    \ web-site\n   (http://www.3gpp.org/) and is open to anyone.  IETF documents,\n\
    \   including preliminary working documents (\"Internet Drafts\") are\n   available\
    \ on its web-site (http://www.ietf.org/) and various shadow\n   sites.\n   IETF\
    \ representatives can obtain information about the 3GPP document\n   and web-site\
    \ structures by contacting the relevant 3GPP contact\n   points indicated at the\
    \ 3GPP web-site http://www.3gpp.org/.\n   3GPP representatives can obtain information\
    \ about the IETF document\n   and web-site structures by contacting the relevant\
    \ IETF contact\n   points (the Area Directors indicated at the IETF web-site\n\
    \   http://www.ietf.org/).\n"
- title: 5. Communication
  contents:
  - "5. Communication\n   Whenever possible, informal communication at working level\
    \ is\n   encouraged.\n   The vast majority of the technical discussions and decision\
    \ making in\n   both IETF and 3GPP is done over mailing lists.  Both 3GPP and\
    \ IETF\n   web sites contain information concerning the associated mailing\n \
    \  lists.\n   It is recommended that interested individuals subscribe to and\n\
    \   participate in these lists.\n   When deemed necessary, formal communication\
    \ between 3GPP and IETF is\n   also permitted.  Relevant IETF Area Directors and\
    \ 3GPP technical\n   leadership are encouraged and authorized to facilitate such\n\
    \   communications when needed.\n"

- title: 6.1 IETF coordination support in 3GPP
  contents:
  - "6.1 IETF coordination support in 3GPP\n   An IETF rapporteur function is established\
    \ in 3GPP TSG-SA.\n   The individual(s) appointed to undertake the responsibility\
    \ of this\n   function should be the initial contact point in 3GPP for matters\n\
    \   pertaining to the 3GPP-IETF cooperation.  Of course, the chairman of\n   TSG-SA\
    \ can always be contacted.\n   The 3GPP-IETF rapporteur function, therefore, is\
    \ expected to work\n   with the concerned working groups and TSGs and support\
    \ the\n   interaction between 3GPP and IETF.\n"
- title: 6.2 3GPP Liaison in IETF
  contents:
  - "6.2 3GPP Liaison in IETF\n   The preferred way for organizations to work with\
    \ IETF is through the\n   working groups.  However, IETF has a limited number\
    \ of liaison\n   relationships with other organizations when conditions warrant\
    \ the\n   appointment of a specific person.\n   The appointment, by the IAB, of\
    \ a specific person to function as a\n   \"3GPP liaison\" is proposed.\n   The\
    \ role of the 3GPP Liaison is to act as an initial contact point in\n   IETF for\
    \ administrative aspects of this collaboration that cannot\n   easily be handled\
    \ in other ways (e.g., at a technical level by\n   interactions with IETF Working\
    \ Groups or Area Directors).  It is\n   agreed that the role does not carry the\
    \ expectation of attendance at\n   3GPP meetings or participation in 3GPP administrative\
    \ processes and\n   anticipated that all liaison efforts assigned to this individual\
    \ will\n   be carried out by electronic mail.  It is understood that the liaison\n\
    \   will not have the ability to make exceptions to, or special\n   provisions\
    \ for, IETF policies and procedures.\n"

  - "9. Participation\n   In order to assist the information flow between the organizations,\n\
    \   the IETF can on per case basis appoint a rapporteur to participate\n   and\
    \ represent IETF at 3GPP technical meetings.\n   IETF meetings are open to any\
    \ interested individuals.\n   3GPP partners (OPs, MRPs) or individual members\
    \ can participate in\n   any of the IETF meetings, in accordance with the existing\
    \ IETF\n   procedures.\n"
