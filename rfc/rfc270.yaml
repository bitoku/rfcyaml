  - "                    CORRECTION TO BBN REPORT NO. 1822\n   In the process of generating\
    \ RFC #271 we have discovered a set of\n   errors in BBN Report No. 1822 (NIC\
    \ 7958).  The attached page is a\n   corrected version of page 25; in addition\
    \ the first two lines should\n   be deleted from page 26.  The paragraph at the\
    \ top of page 25 is\n   changed to show that the Host is NOT marked dead under\
    \ the stated\n   conditions, and to show that the timeout period is 30 (rather\
    \ than\n   40) seconds.  In the footnote, the two changes are underlined; these\n\
    \   changes also show the timeout period as 30 seconds.  A more formal\n   update\
    \ to Report 1822 will be distributed eventually.\n   Please note that these changes\
    \ reflect errors in previous versions of\n   Report 1822, _not_ changes to the\
    \ IMP system.  The timeout period has\n   ALWAYS been 30 seconds and the Host\
    \ was NEVER marked dead under these\n   conditions.\n          [This RFC was put\
    \ into machine readable form for entry]\n      [into the online RFC archives by\
    \ Kelly Tardif, Viagnie 10/99]\n"
