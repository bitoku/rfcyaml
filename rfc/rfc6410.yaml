  - "1.  Introduction\n   This document changes the Internet Standards Process defined\
    \ in RFC\n   2026 [1].  In recent years, the Internet Engineering Task Force\n\
    \   (IETF) witnessed difficulty advancing documents through the maturity\n   levels:\
    \ Proposed Standard, Draft Standard, and finally Standard.\n   These changes are\
    \ designed to simplify the Standards Process and\n   reduce impediments to standards\
    \ progression while preserving the most\n   important benefits of the IETF engineering\
    \ approach.  In addition,\n   the requirement for annual review of Standards Track\
    \ documents that\n   have not reached the top of the maturity ladder is removed\
    \ from the\n   Internet Standards Process.\n   Over the years, there have been\
    \ many proposals for refining the\n   Internet Standards Process to reduce impediments\
    \ to standards\n   progression.  During May 2010, the Internet Engineering Steering\n\
    \   Group (IESG) discussed many of these proposals.  Then, a plenary\n   discussion\
    \ at IETF 78 in July 2010 demonstrated significant support\n   for transition\
    \ from a three-tier maturity ladder to one with two\n   tiers.\n   In the Internet\
    \ Standards Process, experience with a Proposed\n   Standard is expected to motivate\
    \ revisions that clarify, modify,\n   enhance, or remove features.  However, in\
    \ recent years, the vast\n   majority of Standards Track documents are published\
    \ as Proposed\n   Standards and never advance to a higher maturity level.  Very\
    \ few\n   specifications have advanced on the maturity ladder in the last\n  \
    \ decade.  Changing the Internet Standards Process from three maturity\n   levels\
    \ to two is intended to create an environment where lessons from\n   implementation\
    \ and deployment experience are used to improve\n   specifications.\n   The primary\
    \ aspect of this change is to revise the requirements for\n   advancement beyond\
    \ Proposed Standard.  RFC 2026 [1] requires a report\n   that documents interoperability\
    \ between at least two implementations\n   from different code bases as an interim\
    \ step (\"Draft Standard\")\n   before a specification can be advanced further\
    \ to the third and final\n   maturity level (\"Standard\") based on widespread\
    \ deployment and use.\n   In contrast, this document requires measuring interoperability\n\
    \   through widespread deployment of multiple implementations from\n   different\
    \ code bases, thus condensing the two separate metrics into\n   one.\n   The result\
    \ of this change is expected to be maturity-level\n   advancement based on achieving\
    \ widespread deployment of quality\n   specifications.  Additionally, the change\
    \ will result in the\n   incorporation of lessons from implementation and deployment\n\
    \   experience, and recognition that protocols are improved by removing\n   complexity\
    \ associated with unused features.\n   In RFC 2026 [1], widespread deployment\
    \ is essentially the metric used\n   for advancement from Draft Standard to Standard.\
    \  The use of this\n   same metric for advancement beyond Proposed Standard means\
    \ that there\n   is no longer a useful distinction between the top two tiers of\
    \ the\n   maturity ladder.  Thus, the maturity ladder is reduced to two tiers.\n\
    \   In addition, RFC 2026 [1] requires annual review of specifications\n   that\
    \ have not achieved the top maturity level.  This review is no\n   longer required.\n"
- title: 2.  Two Maturity Levels
  contents:
  - "2.  Two Maturity Levels\n   This document replaces the three-tier maturity ladder\
    \ defined in RFC\n   2026 [1] with a two-tier maturity ladder.  Specifications\
    \ become\n   Internet Standards through a set of two maturity levels known as\
    \ the\n   \"Standards Track\".  These maturity levels are \"Proposed Standard\"\
    \ and\n   \"Internet Standard\".\n   A specification may be, and indeed, is likely\
    \ to be, revised as it\n   advances from Proposed Standard to Internet Standard.\
    \  When a revised\n   specification is proposed for advancement to Internet Standard,\
    \ the\n   IESG shall determine the scope and significance of the changes to the\n\
    \   specification, and, if necessary and appropriate, modify the\n   recommended\
    \ action.  Minor revisions and the removal of unused\n   features are expected,\
    \ but a significant revision may require that\n   the specification accumulate\
    \ more experience at Proposed Standard\n   before progressing.\n"
- title: '2.1.  The First Maturity Level: Proposed Standard'
  contents:
  - "2.1.  The First Maturity Level: Proposed Standard\n   The stated requirements\
    \ for Proposed Standard are not changed; they\n   remain exactly as specified\
    \ in RFC 2026 [1].  No new requirements are\n   introduced; no existing published\
    \ requirements are relaxed.\n"
- title: '2.2.  The Second Maturity Level: Internet Standard'
  contents:
  - "2.2.  The Second Maturity Level: Internet Standard\n   This maturity level is\
    \ a merger of Draft Standard and Standard as\n   specified in RFC 2026 [1].  The\
    \ chosen name avoids confusion between\n   \"Draft Standard\" and \"Internet-Draft\"\
    .\n   The characterization of an Internet Standard remains as described in\n \
    \  RFC 2026 [1], which says:\n      An Internet Standard is characterized by a\
    \ high degree of\n      technical maturity and by a generally held belief that\
    \ the\n      specified protocol or service provides significant benefit to the\n\
    \      Internet community.\n   The IESG, in an IETF-wide Last Call of at least\
    \ four weeks, confirms\n   that a document advances from Proposed Standard to\
    \ Internet Standard.\n   The request for reclassification is sent to the IESG\
    \ along with an\n   explanation of how the criteria have been met.  The criteria\
    \ are:\n   (1) There are at least two independent interoperating implementations\n\
    \       with widespread deployment and successful operational experience.\n  \
    \ (2) There are no errata against the specification that would cause a\n     \
    \  new implementation to fail to interoperate with deployed ones.\n   (3) There\
    \ are no unused features in the specification that greatly\n       increase implementation\
    \ complexity.\n   (4) If the technology required to implement the specification\n\
    \       requires patented or otherwise controlled technology, then the\n     \
    \  set of implementations must demonstrate at least two independent,\n       separate\
    \ and successful uses of the licensing process.\n   After review and consideration\
    \ of significant errata, the IESG will\n   perform an IETF-wide Last Call of at\
    \ least four weeks on the\n   requested reclassification.  If there is consensus\
    \ for\n   reclassification, the RFC will be reclassified without publication of\n\
    \   a new RFC.\n   As stated in RFC 2026 [1], in a timely fashion after the expiration\n\
    \   of the Last Call period, the IESG shall make its final determination\n   and\
    \ notify the IETF of its decision via electronic mail to the IETF\n   Announce\
    \ mailing list.  No changes are made to Section 6.1.2 of RFC\n   2026 [1].\n"
- title: 2.3.  Transition to a Standards Track with Two Maturity Levels
  contents:
  - "2.3.  Transition to a Standards Track with Two Maturity Levels\n   Any protocol\
    \ or service that is currently at the Proposed Standard\n   maturity level remains\
    \ so.\n   Any protocol or service that is currently at the Standard maturity\n\
    \   level shall be immediately reclassified as an Internet Standard.\n   Any protocol\
    \ or service that is currently at the abandoned Draft\n   Standard maturity level\
    \ will retain that classification, absent\n   explicit actions.  Two possible\
    \ actions are available:\n   (1) A Draft Standard may be reclassified as an Internet\
    \ Standard as\n       soon as the criteria in Section 2.2 are satisfied.\n   (2)\
    \ At any time after two years from the approval of this document as\n       a\
    \ BCP, the IESG may choose to reclassify any Draft Standard\n       document as\
    \ Proposed Standard.\n"

  - "3.1.  Removal of Requirement for Annual Review\n   In practice, the annual review\
    \ of Proposed Standard and Draft\n   Standard documents after two years (called\
    \ for in RFC 2026 [1]) has\n   not taken place.  Lack of this review has not revealed\
    \ any ill\n   effects on the Internet Standards Process.  As a result, the\n \
    \  requirement for this review is dropped.  No review cycle is imposed\n   on\
    \ Standards Track documents at any maturity level.\n"

  contents:
  - "3.2.  Requirement for Interoperability Testing Reporting\n   Testing for interoperability\
    \ is a long tradition in the development\n   of Internet protocols and remains\
    \ important for reliable deployment\n   of services.  The IETF Standards Process\
    \ no longer requires a formal\n   interoperability report, recognizing that deployment\
    \ and use is\n   sufficient to show interoperability.\n   Although no longer required\
    \ by the IETF Standards Processes, RFC 5657\n   [2] can be helpful to conduct\
    \ interoperability testing.\n"
