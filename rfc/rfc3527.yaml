  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   In RFC 2131, the giaddr specifies an IP address which determines\
    \ a\n   subnet (and from there a link) on which a DHCP client resides as well\n\
    \   as an IP address which can be used to communicate with the relay\n   agent.\
    \  The subnet-selection option [RFC 3011] allows these functions\n   of the giaddr\
    \ to be split, so that when one entity is performing as a\n   DHCP proxy, it can\
    \ specify the subnet/link from which to allocate an\n   IP address that is different\
    \ from the IP address with which it\n   desires to communicate with the DHCP server.\n\
    \   Analogous situations exist where the relay agent needs to specify the\n  \
    \ subnet/link on which a DHCP client resides, which is different from\n   an IP\
    \ address that can be used to communicate with the relay agent.\n   Consider the\
    \ following architecture:\n      +--------+         +---------------+\n      |\
    \  DHCP  |     IP x|               |IP y\n      | Server |-.......-|  Relay Agent\
    \  |----+------------+\n      +--------+         |               |    |      \
    \      |\n                         +---------------+    |         +------+\n \
    \                                             |         |Modem |\n           \
    \                                   |         +------+\n                     \
    \                         |          |    |\n                                \
    \           +-----+  +-----+ +-----+\n                                       \
    \    |Host1|  |Host2| |Host3|\n                                           +-----+\
    \  +-----+ +-----+\n   In the usual approach, the relay agent would put IP address\
    \ Y into\n   the giaddr of any packets that it forwarded to the DHCP server.\n\
    \   However, if for any reason, IP address Y is not accessible from the\n   DHCP\
    \ server, this approach will fail.  There are several reasons why\n   IP y might\
    \ be inaccessible from the DHCP server:\n      o  There might be some firewall\
    \ capability in the network element\n         in which the relay agent resides\
    \ that does not allow the DHCP\n         server to access the relay agent via\
    \ IP y.\n      o  There might not be an IP y.  An example would be the case where\n\
    \         there was only one host and this was a point to point link.\n   In any\
    \ of these or other cases, the relay agent needs to be able to\n   communicate\
    \ to the DHCP server the subnet/link from which to allocate\n   an IP address.\
    \  The IP address, which will communicate to the DHCP\n   server the subnet/link\
    \ information, cannot be used as a way to\n   communicate between the DHCP server\
    \ and the relay agent.\n   Since the relay agent can modify the client's DHCP\
    \ DHCPREQUEST in\n   only two ways, the giaddr and the relay-agent-info option,\
    \ there is a\n   need to extend the relay-agent-info option with a new sub-option,\
    \ the\n   link-selection sub-option, to allow separation of the specification\n\
    \   of the subnet/link from the IP address to use when communicating with\n  \
    \ the relay agent.\n"

  - "2.  Terminology\n   The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\"\
    , \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and\
    \ \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n   document are to be interpreted as described in BCP\
    \ 14, RFC 2119 [RFC\n   2119].\n   This document uses the following terms:\n \
    \     o  \"DHCP client\"\n         A DHCP client is an Internet host using DHCP\
    \ to obtain\n         configuration parameters such as a network address.\n  \
    \    o  \"DHCP relay agent\"\n         A DHCP relay agent is a third-party agent\
    \ that transfers BOOTP\n         and DHCP messages between clients and servers\
    \ residing on\n         different subnets, per [RFC 951] and [RFC 1542].\n   \
    \   o  \"DHCP server\"\n         A DHCP server is an Internet host that returns\
    \ configuration\n         parameters to DHCP clients.\n      o  \"link\"\n   \
    \      A link is a communications facility or medium over which nodes\n      \
    \   can communicate at the link layer, i.e., the layer immediately\n         below\
    \ IPv4.  Examples are Ethernets (simple or bridged); PPP\n         links; X.25,\
    \ Frame Relay, or ATM networks; and internet (or\n         higher) layer \"tunnels\"\
    , such as tunnels over IPv4 or IPv6\n         itself.\n      o  \"subnet\"\n \
    \        A subnet (for the purposes of this document) consists of a\n        \
    \ routable address range.  It may be one of several that exist on\n         a\
    \ link at the same time.\n"
- title: 3.  Link selection sub-option definition
  contents:
  - "3.  Link selection sub-option definition\n   The link-selection sub-option is\
    \ used by any DHCP relay agent that\n   desires to specify a subnet/link for a\
    \ DHCP client request that it is\n   relaying but needs the subnet/link specification\
    \ to be different from\n   the IP address the DHCP server should use when communicating\
    \ with the\n   relay agent.\n   The sub-option contains a single IP address that\
    \ is an address\n   contained in a subnet. The value for the subnet address is\
    \ determined\n   by taking any IP address on the subnet and ANDing that address\
    \ with\n   the subnet mask (i.e., the network and subnet bits are left alone and\n\
    \   the remaining (address) bits are set to zero).  This determines a\n   single\
    \ subnet, and when allocating an IP address, all of the other\n   related subnets\
    \ on the same link will also be considered in the same\n   way as currently specified\
    \ for the processing of the giaddr in [RFC\n   2131, Section 4.3.1, first group\
    \ of bullets, bullet 4].\n   In scenarios where this sub-option is needed, the\
    \ relay agent adds it\n   whenever it sets the giaddr value (i.e., on all messages\
    \ relayed to\n   the DHCP server).\n   When the DHCP server is allocating an address\
    \ and this sub-option is\n   present, then the DHCP server MUST allocate the address\
    \ on either:\n      o  the subnet specified in the link-selection sub-option,\
    \ or;\n      o  a subnet on the same link (also known as a network segment) as\n\
    \         the subnet specified by the link-selection sub-option.\n   The format\
    \ of the sub-option is:\n             SubOpt   Len     subnet IP address\n   \
    \         +------+------+------+------+------+------+\n            |  5   |  \
    \ 4  |  a1  |  a2  |  a3  |  a4  |\n            +------+------+------+------+------+------+\n\
    \   A relay agent which uses this sub-option MUST assume that the server\n   receiving\
    \ the sub-option supports the sub-option and uses the\n   information available\
    \ in the sub-option to correctly allocate an IP\n   address.  A relay agent which\
    \ uses this sub-option MUST NOT take\n   different actions based on whether this\
    \ sub-option appears or does\n   not appear in the response packet from the server.\n\
    \   It is important to ensure, using administrative techniques, that any\n   relay\
    \ agent employing this sub-option is directed to only send\n   packets to a server\
    \ that supports this sub-option.\n   Support for this sub-option does not require\
    \ changes to operations or\n   features of the DHCP server other than to select\
    \ the subnet (and\n   link) on which to allocate an address.  For example, the\
    \ handling of\n   DHCPDISCOVER for an unknown subnet should continue to operate\n\
    \   unchanged.\n   In the event that a DHCP server receives a packet that contains\
    \ both\n   a subnet-selection option [RFC 3011], as well as a link-selection\n\
    \   sub-option, the information contained in the link-selection sub-\n   option\
    \ MUST be used to control the allocation of an IP address in\n   preference to\
    \ the information contained in the subnet-selection\n   option.\n   When this\
    \ sub-option is present and the server supports this sub-\n   option, the server\
    \ MUST NOT offer an address that is not on the\n   requested subnet or the link\
    \ (network segment) with which that subnet\n   is associated.\n   The IP address\
    \ to which a DHCP server sends a reply MUST be the same\n   as it would choose\
    \ when this sub-option is not present.\n"
- title: 4.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "4.  Security Considerations\n   Potential attacks on DHCP are discussed in section\
    \ 7 of the DHCP\n   protocol specification [RFC 2131], as well as in the DHCP\n\
    \   authentication specification [RFC 3118].\n   The link-selection sub-option\
    \ allows a relay agent to specify the\n   subnet/link on which to allocate an\
    \ address for a DHCP client.  Given\n   that the subnet-selection option already\
    \ exists [RFC 3011], no\n   fundamental new security issues are raised by the\
    \ existence of the\n   link-selection sub-option specified in this document beyond\
    \ those\n   implied by the subnet-selection option [RFC 3011].\n   The existence\
    \ of either the subnet-selection option or link-selection\n   sub-option documented\
    \ here would allow a malicious DHCP client to\n   perform a more complete address-pool\
    \ exhaustion attack than could be\n   performed without the use of these options,\
    \ since the client would no\n   longer be restricted to attacking address-pools\
    \ on just its local\n   subnet.\n   There is some minor protection against this\
    \ form of attack using this\n   sub-option that is not present for the subnet-selection\
    \ option, in\n   that a trusted relay agent that supports the relay-agent-info\
    \ option\n   MUST discard a packet it receives with a zero giaddr and a relay-\n\
    \   agent-info option when that packet arrives on an \"untrusted\" circuit\n \
    \  [RFC 3046, section 2.1].\n"
