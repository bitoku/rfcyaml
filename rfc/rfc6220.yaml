- title: 1.  Overview
  contents:
  - "1.  Overview\n   Many IETF protocols make use of commonly defined values that\
    \ are\n   passed within messages or packets.  To ensure consistent\n   interpretation\
    \ of these values between independent implementations,\n   there is a need to\
    \ ensure that the values and associated semantic\n   intent are uniquely defined.\
    \  The IETF uses registries to record each\n   of the possible values of a protocol\
    \ parameter and their associated\n   semantic intent.  These registries, their\
    \ registration policy, and\n   the layout of their content are defined in the\
    \ so-called \"IANA\n   Considerations\" sections of IETF documents.\n   The organizational\
    \ separation between the IETF and its Registry\n   Operators parallels ones that\
    \ are fairly common among standards\n   development organizations (SDOs) although\
    \ less common among\n   technology consortia and similar bodies.  These functions\
    \ have been\n   separated into different organizations for several reasons.  They\n\
    \   include dealing with administrative issues, addressing concerns about\n  \
    \ maintaining an adequate distance between basic policy and specific\n   allocations,\
    \ and avoiding any potential conflicts of interest that\n   might arise from commercial\
    \ or organizational relationships.  For\n   example, most ISO and ISO/IEC JTC1\
    \ standards that require\n   registration activities specify a Registration Authority\
    \ (RA) or\n   Maintenance Agency (MA) that, in turn, control the actual\n   registration\
    \ decisions.  The databases of what is registered for each\n   standard may then\
    \ be maintained by a secretariat or database function\n   associated with the\
    \ RA or MA or, less frequently, by the secretariat\n   of the body that created\
    \ and maintains the standard itself.\n   This structural separation of roles exists\
    \ within several places in\n   the IETF framework (e.g., the RFC Editor function).\
    \  The Internet\n   Architecture Board (IAB), on behalf of the IETF, has the\n\
    \   responsibility to define and manage the relationship with the\n   Protocol\
    \ Registry Operator role.  This responsibility includes the\n   selection and\
    \ management of the Protocol Parameter Registry Operator,\n   as well as management\
    \ of the parameter registration process and the\n   guidelines for parameter allocation.\n\
    \   As with other SDOs, although it may delegate authority for some\n   specific\
    \ decisions, the IETF asserts authority and responsibility for\n   the management\
    \ of all of its protocol parameters and their\n   registries, even while it generally\
    \ remains isolated from the\n   selection of particular values once a registration\
    \ is approved.  This\n   document describes the function of these registries as\
    \ they apply to\n   individual protocol parameters defined by the IETF Internet\
    \ Standards\n   Process [RFC2026] to allow for an orderly implementation by the\n\
    \   Internet Administrative Oversight Committee (IAOC), and others as\n   needed,\
    \ under guidance from the IAB.\n   Below we provide a description of the requirements\
    \ for these\n   delegated functions, which the IETF traditionally refers to as\
    \ the\n   Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) function.\n"
- title: 2.  Roles and Responsibilities Concerning IETF Protocol Parameter
  contents:
  - "2.  Roles and Responsibilities Concerning IETF Protocol Parameter\n    Registries\n\
    \   The IETF's longstanding practice is to outsource the management and\n   implementation\
    \ of some important functions (e.g., [RFC5620]).  The\n   protocol parameter registry\
    \ function falls into this category of\n   outsourced functions, and what follows\
    \ here is the description of the\n   roles and responsibilities with respect to\
    \ the registration of IETF\n   protocol parameters.\n   Specifically, this document\
    \ describes the operation and role of a\n   delegated IETF Protocol Parameter\
    \ Registry Operator, to be selected\n   and administered by the IETF Administrative\
    \ Support Activity (IASA)\n   [RFC4071].  While there is generally a single Protocol\
    \ Parameter\n   Registry Operator, additional Operators may be selected to implement\n\
    \   specific registries, and that has been done occasionally.  Having a\n   single\
    \ Operator facilitates coordination among registries, even those\n   that are\
    \ not obviously related, and also makes it easier to have\n   consistency of formats\
    \ and registry structure, which aids users of\n   the registries and assists with\
    \ quality control.\n   Many protocols make use of identifiers consisting of constants\
    \ and\n   other well-known values.  Even after a protocol has been defined and\n\
    \   deployment has begun, new values may need to be assigned (e.g., for a\n  \
    \ new option type in DHCP, or a new encryption or authentication\n   algorithm\
    \ for IPsec).  To ensure that such quantities have consistent\n   values and interpretations\
    \ in different implementations, their\n   assignment must be administered by a\
    \ central authority.  For IETF\n   protocols, that role is provided by a delegated\
    \ Protocol Parameter\n   Registry Operator.  For any particular protocol parameter\
    \ there is a\n   single delegated Registry Operator.\n"
- title: 2.1.  Protocol Parameter Registry Operator Role
  contents:
  - "2.1.  Protocol Parameter Registry Operator Role\n   The IETF Protocol Parameter\
    \ Registry function is undertaken under the\n   auspices of the Internet Architecture\
    \ Board.\n   The roles of the Protocol Parameter Registry Operator are as follows:\n\
    \   o Review and Advise\n     * A Registry Operator may be requested to review\
    \ Internet-Drafts\n       that are being considered by the Internet Engineering\
    \ Steering\n       Group (IESG), with the objective of offering advice to the\
    \ IESG\n       regarding the contents of the \"IANA Considerations\" section,\n\
    \       whether such a section, when required, is clear in terms of\n       direction\
    \ to the Registry Operator, and whether the section is\n       consistent with\
    \ the current published Registry Operator\n       guidelines.\n   o Registry\n\
    \     * To operate a registry of protocol parameter assignments.\n     * The delegated\
    \ Registry Operator registers values for Internet\n       protocol parameters\
    \ only as directed by the criteria and\n       procedures specified in RFCs, including\
    \ Proposed, Draft, and full\n       Internet Standards, Best Current Practice\
    \ documents, and other\n       RFCs that require protocol parameter assignment.\n\
    \       If values for Internet protocol parameters were not specified, or\n  \
    \     in case of ambiguity, the Registry Operator will continue to\n       assign\
    \ and register only those protocol parameters that have\n       already been delegated\
    \ to the Operator, following past and\n       current practice for such assignments,\
    \ unless otherwise directed\n       in terms of operating practice by the IESG.\
    \  In the case of\n       ambiguity, the Registry Operator is expected to identify\
    \ the\n       ambiguity to the IAB or IESG as appropriate and either suggest\n\
    \       better text or ask the appropriate parties for clarification.\n     *\
    \ For each protocol parameter, the associated registry includes:\n       + a reference\
    \ to the RFC document that describes the parameter\n         and the associated\
    \ \"IANA Considerations\" concerning the\n         parameter, and\n       + for\
    \ each registration of a protocol parameter value, the source\n         of the\
    \ registration and the date of the registration, if the\n         date of registration\
    \ is known, and\n       + any other information specified as being included in\
    \ the\n         registration data in the RFC document that describes the\n   \
    \      parameter.\n       + If in doubt or in case of a technical dispute, the\
    \ Registry\n         Operator will seek and follow technical guidance exclusively\n\
    \         from the IESG.  Where appropriate, the IESG will appoint an\n      \
    \   expert to advise the Registry Operator.\n     * The Registry Operator will\
    \ work with the IETF to develop any\n       missing criteria and procedures over\
    \ time, which the Registry\n       Operator will adopt when so instructed by the\
    \ IESG.\n     * Unless special circumstances apply to subsets of the data and\n\
    \       specific rules are established by IETF consensus, each protocol\n    \
    \   parameter registry operates as a public registry, and the\n       contents\
    \ of the registry are openly available to the public,\n       on-line and free\
    \ of charge.\n     * The Registry Operator assigns protocol parameter values in\n\
    \       accordance with the policy associated with the protocol\n       parameter,\
    \ such as \"First Come First Served\" or \"Expert Review\"\n       [RFC5226].\n\
    \   o Mailing Lists\n     * The Registry Operator maintains public mailing lists\
    \ as specified\n       in IANA Considerations [RFC5226].  Such lists are designated\
    \ for\n       the purpose of review of assignment proposals in conjunction with\n\
    \       a designated expert review function.  In addition, each Protocol\n   \
    \    Parameter Registry Operator should maintain a mailing list that\n       enables\
    \ the registry staff of the Registry Operator to be\n       contacted by email.\n\
    \   o Liaison Activity\n     * The Registry Operator will nominate a liaison point\
    \ of contact.\n       The Registry Operator, through this liaison, may be requested\
    \ to\n       provide advice to the IESG on IETF protocol parameters as well as\n\
    \       the \"IANA Considerations\" section of each Internet-Draft that is\n \
    \      being reviewed for publication as an RFC.  Where appropriate the\n    \
    \   IESG will appoint an expert to advise the Registry Operator.\n   o Reporting\n\
    \     * The Registry Operator will submit periodic reports to the IAB\n      \
    \ concerning the operational performance of the registry function.\n       As\
    \ an example of the requirements for such reports, the reader is\n       referred\
    \ to a supplement [IAOC_SUPP] to the \"Memorandum of\n       Understanding Concerning\
    \ the Technical Work of the Internet\n       Assigned Numbers Authority\" [RFC2860]\
    \ that provides service level\n       agreement (SLA) guidelines under which ICANN,\
    \ the current\n       protocol parameter registry, must operate.\n     * At the\
    \ request of the chair of the IETF, IAB, or IAOC, the\n       Registry Operator\
    \ will undertake periodic reports to IETF Plenary\n       meetings concerning\
    \ the status of the registry function.\n     * The Registry Operator will publish\
    \ an annual report describing\n       the status of the function and a summary\
    \ of performance\n       indicators.\n   o  Intellectual Property Rights and the\
    \ Registry Operator\n     * All assigned values are to be published and made available\
    \ free\n       of any charges.\n     * The assignment values may be redistributed\
    \ without modification.\n     * Any intellectual property rights of the IETF protocol\
    \ parameter\n       assignment information, including the IETF protocol parameter\n\
    \       registry and its contents, are to be held by the IETF Trust\n       [RFC4748].\n"
