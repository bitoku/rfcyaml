- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   [RFC4862] specifies Stateless Address Autoconfiguration\
    \ (SLAAC) for\n   IPv6 [RFC2460], which typically results in hosts configuring\
    \ one or\n   more \"stable\" addresses composed of a network prefix advertised\
    \ by a\n   local router, and an Interface Identifier (IID) [RFC4291] that\n  \
    \ typically embeds a stable link-layer address (e.g., an IEEE LAN MAC\n   address).\n\
    \   In some network technologies and adaptation layers, the use of an IID\n  \
    \ based on a link-layer address may offer some advantages.  For\n   example, [RFC6282]\
    \ allows for the compression of IPv6 datagrams over\n   IEEE 802.15.4-based networks\
    \ [RFC4944] when the IID is based on the\n   underlying link-layer address.\n\
    \   The security and privacy implications of embedding a stable link-\n   layer\
    \ address in an IPv6 IID have been known for some time now and\n   are discussed\
    \ in great detail in [RFC7721].  They include:\n   o  Network-activity correlation\n\
    \   o  Location tracking\n   o  Address scanning\n   o  Device-specific vulnerability\
    \ exploitation\n   More generally, the reuse of identifiers that have their own\n\
    \   semantics or properties across different contexts or scopes can be\n   detrimental\
    \ for security and privacy [NUM-IDS].  In the case of\n   traditional stable IPv6\
    \ IIDs, some of the security and privacy\n   implications are dependent on the\
    \ properties of the underlying link-\n   layer addresses (e.g., whether the link-layer\
    \ address is ephemeral or\n   randomly generated), while other implications (e.g.,\
    \ reduction of the\n   entropy of the IID) depend on the algorithm for generating\
    \ the IID\n   itself.  In standardized recommendations for stable IPv6 IID\n \
    \  generation meant to achieve particular security and privacy\n   properties,\
    \ it is necessary to recommend against embedding stable\n   link-layer addresses\
    \ in IPv6 IIDs.\n   Furthermore, some popular IPv6 implementations have already\
    \ deviated\n   from the traditional stable IID generation scheme to mitigate the\n\
    \   aforementioned security and privacy implications [Microsoft].\n   As a result\
    \ of the aforementioned issues, this document changes the\n   recommended default\
    \ IID generation scheme for generating stable IPv6\n   addresses with SLAAC to\
    \ that specified in [RFC7217] and recommends\n   against embedding stable link-layer\
    \ addresses in IPv6 Interface\n   Identifiers, such that the aforementioned issues\
    \ are mitigated.  That\n   is, this document simply replaces the default algorithm\
    \ that is\n   recommended to be employed when generating stable IPv6 IIDs.\n \
    \  NOTE:\n      [RFC4291] defines the \"Modified EUI-64 format\" for IIDs.\n \
    \     Appendix A of [RFC4291] then describes how to transform an IEEE\n      EUI-64\
    \ identifier, or an IEEE 802 48-bit MAC address from which an\n      EUI-64 identifier\
    \ is derived, into an IID in the Modified EUI-64\n      format.\n   In a variety\
    \ of scenarios, addresses that remain stable for the\n   lifetime of a host's\
    \ connection to a single subnet are viewed as\n   desirable.  For example, stable\
    \ addresses may be viewed as beneficial\n   for network management, event logging,\
    \ enforcement of access control,\n   provision of quality of service, or for server\
    \ or router interfaces.\n   Similarly, stable addresses (as opposed to temporary\
    \ addresses\n   [RFC4941]) allow for long-lived TCP connections and are also usually\n\
    \   desirable when performing server-like functions (i.e., receiving\n   incoming\
    \ connections).\n   The recommendations in this document apply only in cases where\n\
    \   implementations otherwise would have configured a stable IPv6 IID\n   containing\
    \ a link-layer address.  For example, this document does not\n   change any existing\
    \ recommendations concerning the use of temporary\n   addresses as specified in\
    \ [RFC4941] and the recommendations do not\n   apply to cases where SLAAC is employed\
    \ to generate non-stable IPv6\n   addresses (e.g., by embedding a link-layer address\
    \ that is\n   periodically randomized); in addition, this document does not\n\
    \   introduce any new requirements regarding when stable addresses are to\n  \
    \ be configured.  Thus, the recommendations in this document simply\n   improve\
    \ the security and privacy properties of stable addresses.\n"
