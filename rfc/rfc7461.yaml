  - "1.  Introduction\n   The Energy Management (EMAN) standards provide a specification\
    \ for\n   Energy Management.  This document defines a subset of a Management\n\
    \   Information Base (MIB) for use with network management protocols for\n   Energy\
    \ monitoring of network devices and devices attached to the\n   network and possibly\
    \ extending to devices in the industrial\n   automation setting with a network\
    \ interface.\n   The focus of the MIB module specified in this document is on\
    \ the\n   identification of Energy Objects and reporting the context and\n   relationships\
    \ of Energy Objects as defined in [RFC7326].  The module\n   addresses Energy\
    \ Object identification, Energy Object context, and\n   Energy Object relationships.\n"

  - "1.1.  Energy Management Document Overview\n   This document specifies the Energy\
    \ Object Context (ENERGY-OBJECT-\n   CONTEXT-MIB) and IANA Energy Relationship\
    \ (IANA-ENERGY-RELATION-MIB)\n   modules.  The Energy Object Context MIB module\
    \ specifies MIB objects\n   for identification of Energy Objects, and reporting\
    \ context and\n   relationship of an Energy Object.  The IANA Energy Relationship\
    \ MIB\n   module specifies the first version of the IANA-maintained definitions\n\
    \   of relationships between Energy Objects.\n   Firstly, to illustrate the importance\
    \ of energy monitoring in\n   networks and, secondly, to list some of the important\
    \ areas to be\n   addressed by the Energy Management Framework [RFC7326], several\
    \ use\n   cases and network scenarios are presented in the EMAN applicability\n\
    \   statement document [EMAN-AS].  In addition, for each scenario, the\n   target\
    \ devices for energy management, and how those devices powered\n   and metered\
    \ are also presented.  To address the network scenarios,\n   requirements for\
    \ power and energy monitoring for networking devices\n   are specified in [RFC6988].\
    \  Based on the requirements in [RFC6988],\n   [RFC7326] presents a solution approach.\n\
    \   Accordingly, the scope of the MIB modules in this document is in\n   accordance\
    \ to the requirements specified in [RFC6988] and the\n   concepts from [RFC7326].\n\
    \   This document is based on the Energy Management Framework [RFC7326]\n   and\
    \ meets the requirements on identification of Energy Objects and\n   their context\
    \ and relationships as specified in the Energy Management\n   requirements document\
    \ [RFC6988].\n   A second MIB module meeting the EMAN requirements [RFC6988] the\n\
    \   Monitoring and Control MIB for Power and Energy [RFC7460], monitors\n   the\
    \ Energy Objects for Power States, for the Power and Energy\n   consumption. \
    \ Power State monitoring includes: retrieving Power\n   States, Power State properties,\
    \ current Power State, Power State\n   transitions, and Power State statistics.\
    \  In addition, this MIB\n   module provides the Power Characteristics properties\
    \ of the Power and\n   Energy, along with optional characteristics.\n   The applicability\
    \ statement document [EMAN-AS] provides the list of\n   use cases, describes the\
    \ common aspects between existing Energy\n   standards and the EMAN standard,\
    \ and shows how the EMAN framework\n   relates to other frameworks.\n"

    \ objects are contained in two tables: eoTable and\n   eoRelationTable.\n   The\
    \ first table, eoTable, focuses on the link to the other MIB\n   modules, on identification,\

    \ Energy Object MUST implement the unique index,\n   entPhysicalIndex, entPhysicalName,\
    \ entPhysicalClass, and\n   entPhysicalUUID from the ENTITY-MIB [RFC6933].  Module\
    \ Compliance\n   with respect to entity4CRCompliance of ENTITY-MIB MUST be supported,\n\
    \   which requires a limited number of objects supported\n   (entPhysicalIndex,\
    \ entPhysicalName, entPhysicalClass, and\n   entPhysicalUUID).  entPhysicalIndex\
    \ is used as index for the Energy\n   Object in the ENERGY-OBJECT-CONTEXT-MIB\

    \  Energy Objects MUST\n   implement the entPhysicalName object specified in the\

    \ the ENERGY-OBJECT-CONTEXT-MIB compliance, every Energy Object\n   instance MUST\
    \ implement the entPhysicalUUID from the ENTITY-MIB\n   [RFC6933].\n   As displayed\

    \ and Energy Objects, the ENTITY-MIB physical containment\n   tree [RFC6933] MUST\
    \ be implemented.\n   A second example deals with one of the ENTITY-MIB extensions:\
    \ if the\n   Energy Object temperature is required, the managed objects from the\n\
    \   ENTITY-SENSOR-MIB [RFC3433] should be supported.\n   Each Energy Object MUST\

    \ and pethPsePortGroupIndex [RFC3621].\n   If the LLDP-MED MIB [LLDP-MIB] is supported\
    \ by the Energy Object SNMP\n   agent, then the Energy Object eoLldpPortNumber\
    \ MUST contain the\n   corresponding lldpLocPortNum from the LLDP MIB.\n   The\
    \ intent behind the links to the other MIB module identifier(s) is\n   to correlate\

    \   The eoAlternateKey object specifies an alternate key string that can\n   be\
    \ used to identify the Energy Object.  Since an EnMS may need to\n   correlate\
    \ objects across management systems, this alternate key is\n   provided to facilitate\
    \ such a link.  This optional value is intended\n   as a foreign key or alternate\
    \ identifier for a manufacturer or EnMS\n   to use to correlate the unique Energy\
    \ Object Id in other systems or\n   namespaces.  If an alternate key is not available\
    \ or is not\n   applicable, then the value is the zero-length string.\n   An Energy\
    \ Object can have additional MIB objects that can be used for\n   easier identification\
    \ by the EnMS.  The optional objects\n   eoMgmtMacAddress, eoMgmtAddressType,\
    \ and eoMgmtDNSName can be used to\n   help identify the relationship between\
    \ the Energy Objects and other\n   NMS objects.  These objects can be used as\

  - "4.4.   Energy Object Relationships\n   Refer to the \"Relationships\" section\
    \ in [RFC7326] for the definition\n   and background information.  In order to\
    \ link two Energy Objects, a\n   separate table (eoRelationTable) has been introduced\
    \ in this MIB\n   module.\n   Each Energy Object can have one or more Energy Object\
    \ relationships\n   with other Energy Objects.  The relationship between Energy\
    \ Objects\n   is specified in eoRelationTable.  The relationship between the Energy\n\
    \   Objects is specified with the entPhysicalIndex of the Energy Object\n   and\
    \ the UUID of the remote Energy Object.  The UUID MUST comply to\n   the RFC 4122\
    \ specifications.  It is important to note that it is\n   possible that an Energy\
    \ Object may not have an Energy Object\n   relationship with other Energy Objects.\n\
    \   The following relationships between Energy Objects have been\n   considered\
    \ in the eoRelationTable.\n               Metering Relationship     -> meteredBy\
    \ / metering\n               Power Source Relationship -> poweredBy / powering\n\
    \               Aggregation Relationship  -> aggregatedBy / aggregating\n   Energy\
    \ Object B has a \"meteredBy\" relationship with Energy Object A,\n   if the energy\
    \ consumption of Energy Object B is measured by Energy\n   Object A.  Equivalently,\
    \ it is possible to indicate that Energy\n   Object A has a \"metering\" relationship\
    \ with Energy Object B.\n   Energy Object B has a \"poweredBy\" relationship with\
    \ Energy Object A,\n   if the power source of Energy Object B is Energy Object\
    \ A.\n   Equivalently, it is possible to indicate that Energy Object A has a\n\
    \   \"powering\" relationship with Energy Object B.\n   Energy Object B has \"\
    aggregatedBy\" relationship with Energy Object A,\n   if Energy Object A is an\
    \ aggregation point for energy usage of Energy\n   Object B.  Equivalently, it\
    \ is possible to indicate that Energy\n   Object A has \"aggregating\" relationship\
    \ with Energy Object B.\n   The IANA-ENERGY-RELATION-MIB module in Section 5 below\
    \ specifies the\n   first version of the IANA-maintained definitions of relationships.\n\
    \   This way, for Energy Relationships, new textual conventions can be\n   specified,\
    \ without updating the primary Energy Object Context MIB\n   module.\n"
- title: 4.5.   Energy Object Identity Persistence
  contents:
  - "4.5.   Energy Object Identity Persistence\n   In some situations, the Energy\
    \ Object identity information should be\n   persistent even after a device reload.\
    \  For example, in a static\n   setup where a switch monitors a series of connected\
    \ PoE phones, there\n   is a clear benefit for the EnMS if the Energy Object Identification\n\
    \   and all associated information persist, as it saves a network\n   discovery.\
    \  However, in other situations, such as a wireless access\n   point monitoring\
    \ the mobile user PCs, there is not much advantage to\n   persist the Energy Object\
    \ Information.  The identity information of\n   an Energy Object should be persisted\
    \ and there is value in the\n   writable MIB objects persisted.\n"

- title: 6.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "6.  Security Considerations\n   There are a number of management objects defined\
    \ in this MIB module\n   with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.\
    \  Such\n   objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network\n\
    \   environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure\n   environment\
    \ without proper protection opens devices to attack.  These\n   are the tables\
    \ and objects and their sensitivity/vulnerability:\n      Unauthorized changes\
    \ to the eoDomainName, entPhysicalName,\n      eoRoleDescription, eoKeywords,\
    \ eoImportance, eoAlternateKey,\n      eoRelationID, eoRelationship, eoRelationStatus,\
    \ and/or\n      eoRelationStorageType MAY disrupt power and energy collection,\
    \ and\n      therefore any predefined policies defined in the network.\n   SNMP\
    \ versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.\n   Even if the\
    \ network itself is secure (for example by using IPsec),\n   there is no control\
    \ as to who on the secure network is allowed to\n   access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete)\
    \ the objects in this\n   MIB module.\n   Implementations SHOULD provide the security\
    \ features described by the\n   SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410]), and implementations\
    \ claiming\n   compliance to the SNMPv3 standard MUST include full support for\n\
    \   authentication and privacy via the User-based Security Model (USM)\n   [RFC3414]\
    \ with the AES cipher algorithm [RFC3826].  Implementations\n   MAY also provide\
    \ support for the Transport Security Model (TSM)\n   [RFC5591] in combination\
    \ with a secure transport such as SSH\n   [RFC5592] or TLS/DTLS [RFC6353].\n \
    \  Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT\n   RECOMMENDED.\
    \  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to\n   enable cryptographic\
    \ security.  It is then a customer/operator\n   responsibility to ensure that\
    \ the SNMP entity giving access to an\n   instance of this MIB module is properly\
    \ configured to give access to\n   the objects only to those principals (users)\
    \ that have legitimate\n   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete)\
    \ them.\n   In certain situations, energy and power monitoring can reveal\n  \
    \ sensitive information about individuals' activities and habits.\n   Implementors\
    \ of this specification should use appropriate privacy\n   protections as discussed\
    \ in Section 9 of RFC 6988 and monitoring of\n   individuals and homes should\
    \ only occur with proper authorization.\n"
