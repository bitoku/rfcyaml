  - "1.  Introduction\n   Many sites connected to the Internet make use of IPv4 addresses\
    \ that\n   are not globally unique.  Examples are the addresses designated in\n\
    \   [RFC1918] for private use within individual sites.\n   Devices in such environments\
    \ may occasionally originate Domain Name\n   System (DNS) queries (so-called \"\
    reverse lookups\") corresponding to\n   those private-use addresses.  Since the\
    \ addresses concerned have only\n   local significance, it is good practice for\
    \ site administrators to\n   ensure that such queries are answered locally.  However,\
    \ it is not\n   uncommon for such queries to follow the normal delegation path\
    \ in the\n   public DNS instead of being answered within the site.\n   It is not\
    \ possible for public DNS servers to give useful answers to\n   such queries.\
    \  In addition, due to the wide deployment of private-use\n   addresses and the\
    \ continuing growth of the Internet, the volume of\n   such queries is large and\
    \ growing.  The AS112 project aims to provide\n   a distributed sink for such\
    \ queries in order to reduce the load on\n   the IN-ADDR.ARPA authoritative servers.\
    \  The AS112 project is named\n   after the Autonomous System Number (ASN) that\
    \ was assigned to it.\n   Prior to implementation of this technique, the AS112\
    \ project did not\n   accommodate the addition and removal of DNS zones elegantly.\
    \  Since\n   additional zones of definitively local significance are known to\n\
    \   exist, this presents a problem.  This document describes\n   modifications\
    \ to the deployment and use of AS112 infrastructure that\n   will allow zones\
    \ to be added and dropped much more easily.\n   The AS112 project is described\
    \ in detail in [RFC7534].\n   The AS112 nameservers (PRISONER.IANA.ORG, BLACKHOLE-1.IANA.ORG,\
    \ and\n   BLACKHOLE-2.IANA.ORG) are required to answer authoritatively for each\n\
    \   and every zone that is delegated to them.  If a zone is delegated to\n   AS112\
    \ nameservers without those nameservers being configured ahead of\n   time to\
    \ answer authoritatively for that zone, there is a detrimental\n   impact on clients\
    \ following referrals for queries within that zone.\n   This misconfiguration\
    \ is colloquially known as a \"lame delegation\".\n   AS112 nameserver operators\
    \ are only loosely coordinated, and hence\n   adding support for a new zone (or,\
    \ correspondingly, removing support\n   for a zone that is no longer delegated\
    \ to the AS112 nameservers) is\n   difficult to accomplish with accuracy.  Testing\
    \ AS112 nameservers\n   remotely to see whether they are configured to answer\
    \ authoritatively\n   for a particular zone is similarly challenging, since AS112\
    \ nodes are\n   distributed using anycast [RFC4786].\n   This document defines\
    \ a more flexible approach for sinking queries on\n   AS112 infrastructure that\
    \ can be deployed alongside unmodified,\n   existing AS112 nodes.  Instead of\
    \ delegating additional zones\n   directly to AS112 nameservers, DNAME [RFC6672]\
    \ redirection is used.\n   This approach has the advantage that query traffic\
    \ for arbitrary\n   parts of the namespace can be directed to AS112 servers without\
    \ those\n   servers having to be reconfigured every time a zone is added or\n\
    \   removed.\n   This approach makes it possible for any DNS zone administrator\
    \ to\n   sink traffic relating to parts of the global DNS namespace under\n  \
    \ their control to the AS112 infrastructure without coordination with\n   the\
    \ operators of AS112 infrastructure.\n"
- title: 2.  Design Overview
  contents:
  - "2.  Design Overview\n   A new zone, EMPTY.AS112.ARPA, is delegated to a single\
    \ nameserver\n   BLACKHOLE.AS112.ARPA (IPv4 address 192.31.196.1, IPv6 address\n\
    \   2001:4:112::1).\n   The IPv4 address 192.31.196.1 has been selected from the\
    \ prefix\n   assigned by the IANA such that the address is coverable by a single\n\
    \   IPv4 /24 prefix, and that no other address covered by that prefix is\n   in\
    \ use.  The IPv6 address 2001:4:112::1 has been similarly assigned\n   such that\
    \ no other address within a covering /48 is in use.  This\n   addressing plan\
    \ accommodates the anycast distribution of the\n   BLACKHOLE.AS112.ARPA service\
    \ using a single IPv4 service prefix and a\n   single IPv6 service prefix.  See\
    \ [RFC4786] for more discussion of\n   anycast service distribution; see Section\
    \ 8 for the specific actions\n   completed by IANA per this document.\n   Some\
    \ or all of the existing AS112 nodes should be extended to support\n   these new\
    \ nameserver addresses and to host the EMPTY.AS112.ARPA zone.\n   See [RFC7534]\
    \ for revised guidance to AS112 server operators.\n   Each part of the DNS namespace\
    \ for which it is desirable to sink\n   queries at AS112 nameservers should be\
    \ redirected to the\n   EMPTY.AS112.ARPA zone using DNAME [RFC6672].  See Section\
    \ 3.2 for\n   guidance to zone administrators.\n"

  contents:
  - "3.1.  Extensions to Support DNAME Redirection\n   Guidance to operators of AS112\
    \ nodes is extended to include\n   configuration of the 192.31.196.1 and 2001:4:112::1\
    \ addresses, and\n   the corresponding announcement of covering routes for those\n\
    \   addresses, and to host the EMPTY.AS112.ARPA zone.\n   IPv4-only AS112 nodes\
    \ should only configure the 192.31.196.1\n   nameserver address; IPv6-only AS112\
    \ nodes should only configure the\n   2001:4:112::1 nameserver address.\n   It\
    \ is only necessary for a single AS112 server operator to implement\n   these\
    \ extensions for this mechanism to function as intended.  It is\n   beneficial\
    \ if many more than one AS112 server operator makes these\n   changes, however,\
    \ since that provides for greater distribution and\n   capacity for the nameservers\
    \ serving the EMPTY.AS112.ARPA zone.  It\n   is not necessary for all AS112 server\
    \ operators to make these changes\n   for the mechanism to be viable.\n   Detailed\

- title: 3.2.  Redirection of Query Traffic to AS112 Servers
  contents:
  - "3.2.  Redirection of Query Traffic to AS112 Servers\n   Once the EMPTY.AS112.ARPA\
    \ zone has been deployed using the\n   nameservers described in Section 3.1, redirections\
    \ may be installed\n   in the DNS namespace for queries that are intended to be\
    \ answered by\n   the AS112 infrastructure.\n   For example, reverse queries corresponding\
    \ to TEST-NET-1\n   (192.0.2.0/24) [RFC5737] could be redirected to AS112 nameservers\
    \ by\n   installing a DNAME resource record in the 192.IN-ADDR.ARPA zone, as\n\
    \   illustrated in Figure 1.\n     $ORIGIN 192.IN-ADDR.ARPA.\n     ...\n     2.0\
    \     IN      DNAME   EMPTY.AS112.ARPA.\n     ...\n                          \
    \       Figure 1\n   There is no practical limit to the number of redirections\
    \ that can be\n   configured in this fashion.  Redirection of a particular part\
    \ of the\n   namespace to EMPTY.AS112.ARPA can be removed at any time, under the\n\
    \   control of the administrators of the corresponding part of the DNS\n   namespace.\
    \  No changes to deployed AS112 nodes incorporating the\n   extensions described\
    \ in this document are required to support\n   additional redirections.  A list\
    \ of possible candidates for AS112\n   redirection can be found in Section 5.\n\
    \   DNAME resource records deployed for this purpose can be signed with\n   DNSSEC\
    \ [RFC4033], providing a secure means of authenticating the\n   legitimacy of\
    \ each redirection.\n"
- title: 4.  Continuity of AS112 Operations
  contents:
  - "4.  Continuity of AS112 Operations\n   Existing guidance to AS112 server operators\
    \ to accept and respond to\n   queries directed at the PRISONER.IANA.ORG, BLACKHOLE-1.IANA.ORG,\
    \ and\n   BLACKHOLE-2.IANA.ORG nameservers should continue to be followed, and\n\
    \   no changes to the delegation of existing zones hosted on AS112\n   servers\
    \ should occur.  These measures are intended to provide\n   continuity of operations\
    \ for zones currently delegated to AS112\n   servers and avoid any accidental\
    \ client impact due to the changes\n   proposed in this document.\n   Once it\
    \ has become empirically and quantitatively clear that the\n   EMPTY.AS112.ARPA\
    \ zone is well hosted to the extent that it is thought\n   that the existing,\
    \ unmodified AS112 servers host 10.IN-ADDR.ARPA, the\n   decision might be made\
    \ to replace the delegation of those [RFC1918]\n   zones with DNAME redirection.\
    \  Once implemented, the\n   PRISONER.IANA.ORG, BLACKHOLE-1.IANA.ORG, and BLACKHOLE-2.IANA.ORG\n\

  contents:
  - "5.  Candidate Zones for AS112 Redirection\n   All zones listed in [RFC6303] are\
    \ candidates for AS112 redirection.\n   Since no pre-provisioning is required\
    \ on the part of AS112 operators\n   to facilitate sinking of any name in the\
    \ DNS namespace by AS112\n   infrastructure, this mechanism supports AS112 redirection\
    \ by any zone\n   owner in the DNS.\n   This document is simply concerned with\
    \ provision of the AS112\n   redirection service and does not specify that any\
    \ particular AS112\n   redirection be put in place.\n"
- title: 6.  DNAME Deployment Considerations
  contents:
  - "6.  DNAME Deployment Considerations\n   DNAME was specified years after the original\
    \ implementations of\n   [RFC1035], and hence universal deployment cannot be expected.\n\
    \   [RFC6672] specifies a fallback mechanism that makes use of\n   synthesised\
    \ CNAME RRSets for this reason.  The expectation that\n   design choices in the\
    \ DNAME specification ought to mitigate any lack\n   of deployment is reviewed\
    \ below.  Experimental validation of those\n   expectations is included in Appendix\
    \ A.\n   It is a fundamental design requirement of AS112 service that\n   responses\
    \ be cached.  We can safely declare DNAME support on the\n   authoritative server\
    \ to be a prerequisite for DNAME redirection, but\n   the cases where individual\
    \ elements in resolver chains do not support\n   DNAME processing deserve closer\
    \ examination.\n   The expected behaviour when a DNAME response is supplied to\
    \ a\n   resolver that does not support DNAME is that the accompanying,\n   synthesised\
    \ CNAME will be accepted and cached.  Re-query frequency\n   will be determined\
    \ by the TTLs (Time to Live) returned by the\n   DNAME-responding authoritative\
    \ servers.\n   Resolution of the CNAME target is straightforward and functions\n\
    \   exactly as the AS112 project has operated since it was deployed.  The\n  \
    \ negative caching [RFC2308] of the CNAME target follows the parameters\n   defined\
    \ in the target zone, EMPTY.AS112.ARPA.  This has the side\n   effects that all\
    \ redirected names ultimately landing on an AS112 node\n   will be negatively\
    \ cached with the same parameters, but this lack of\n   flexibility seems non-controversial;\
    \ the effect of reducing the\n   negative cache TTL would be increased query volume\
    \ on the AS112 node\n   operator concerned, and hence controls seem well aligned\
    \ with\n   operation.\n   Validating resolvers (i.e., those requesting and processing\
    \ DNSSEC\n   [RFC4033] metadata) are required to implement DNAME and hence should\n\
    \   not make use of synthesised CNAME RRs.  The lack of signature over a\n   received\
    \ CNAME RR should hence not limit the ability to sign the\n   (DNAME) redirection\
    \ point, and for those (DNAME) signatures to be\n   validated.\n   In the case\
    \ where a recursive server implements DNAME but DNAME is\n   not implemented in\
    \ a stub resolver, CNAME synthesis will again\n   provide a viable path.\n   DNAME\
    \ support on AS112 nodes themselves is never required under this\n   proposal.\n"

  contents:
  - "Appendix A.  Assessing Support for DNAME in the Real World\n   To measure the\
    \ extent to which the DNAME construct is supported in\n   the Internet, we have\
    \ used an experimental technique to test the DNS\n   resolvers used by end hosts\
    \ and derive from the test a measurement of\n   DNAME support within the Internet.\n"
- title: A.1.  Methodology
  contents:
  - "A.1.  Methodology\n   The test was conducted by loading a user's browser with\
    \ four URLs\n   to retrieve.  The first three comprise the test setup, while the\n\
    \   final URL communicates the result to the experiment controller.\n   The URLs\
    \ are:\n   A  http://a.<unique_string>.dname.example.com/1x1.png?\n      a.<unique_string>.dname\n\
    \   B  http://b.dname.example.com/1x1.png?\n      b.<unique_string>.dname\n  \
    \ C  http://c.<unique_string>.target.example.net/1x1.png?\n      c.<unique_string>.target\n\
    \   D  http://results.recorder.example.net/1x1.png?\n      results.<unique_string>?za=<a_result>&zb=<b_result>&zc=<c_result>\n\
    \   The A URL is designed to test the end user's capability to resolve a\n   name\
    \ that has never been seen before, so that the resolution of this\n   domain name\
    \ will reliably result in a query at the authoritative\n   nameserver.  This is\
    \ intended to test the use of domain names where\n   there is a dynamic component\
    \ that also uses the DNAME construct.\n   The B URL is deliberately designed to\
    \ be cached by caching resolvers\n   that are used in the process of resolving\
    \ the domain name.\n   The C URL is a control URL.  This is a unique URL, similar\
    \ to A, but\n   does not refer to a DNAME structure.\n   The D URL uses a static\
    \ cacheable domain name.\n   The <unique_string> value is common to the four URLs\
    \ used in each\n   individual instance of this test but varies from test to test.\
    \  The\n   result is that each end user is presented with a unique string.\n \
    \  The contents of the EXAMPLE.COM, TARGET.EXAMPLE.NET, and\n   RECORDER.EXAMPLE.NET\
    \ zones are shown in Figure 3.\n     $ORIGIN EXAMPLE.COM.\n     ...\n     DNAME.\
    \             IN  DNAME  TARGET.EXAMPLE.NET.\n     ...\n     $ORIGIN TARGET.EXAMPLE.NET.\n\
    \     ...\n     B                  IN  A      192.0.2.0\n     *              \

    \ ...\n     RESULTS            IN  A      192.0.2.0\n     ...\n              \
    \                   Figure 3\n   The first three URLs (A, B, and C) are loaded\
    \ as tasks into the\n   user's browser upon execution of the test's script.  The\
    \ script\n   starts a timer with each of these URLs to measure the elapsed time\
    \ to\n   fetch the URL.  The script then waits for the three fetches to\n   complete,\
    \ or 10 seconds, whichever occurs first.  The script then\n   loads the results\
    \ of the three timers into the GET arguments of the\n   D URL and performs a fetch\
    \ to pass these results back to the\n   experiment's server.\n   Logs on the web\
    \ server reached at RESULTS.RECORDER.EXAMPLE.NET will\n   include entries of the\
    \ form shown in Figure 4.  If any of the URLs\n   fail to load within 10 seconds,\
    \ the D URL will report the failure as\n   a \"null\" timer value.\n     GET /1x1.png?results.<unique_string>?za=1822&zb=1674&zc=1582\n\
    \     GET /1x1.png?results.<unique_string>?za=null&zb=null&zc=161\n          \
    \                       Figure 4\n   The script has been encoded in Adobe Flash\
    \ with a simple image in the\n   form of an online advertisement.  An online advertisement\
    \ network has\n   been used to distribute the script.  The script is invoked when\
    \ the\n   advertisement is presented in the end user's browser or application\n\
    \   and does not require the user to click on the supplied image in any\n   way.\
    \  The advertisement placement parameters were set to the broadest\n   possible\
    \ scope to sample users from across the entire Internet.\n"
