    \ Group would like to establish a network\nstandard socket number for a Process\
    \ Discard service (not all HOSTs need\ncooperate.) To do this, it is necessary\
    \ to know which sockets at each\nHOST have already been allocated to standard\
    \ network functions.\n     At all HOSTs which permit login for services, socket\
    \ 1 is the\nNetwork Logger on which ICP may be performed.\n     We would like\
    \ to catalog other sockets which are supposed to be\nwell-known, so we would appreciate\
    \ having a note or phone call from each\nHOST Technical Liaison describing the\
    \ function and socket numbers of\nnetwork service programs at each HOST.  The\
    \ catalog will be published and\nwe would recommend that it be maintained at NIC.\n\
