Abstract This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB) for use with network management protocols in TCP/IP based internets.
In particular, it defines objects for managing  Fibre Channel Over TCP/IP (FCIP) entities, which are used to interconnect Fibre Channel (FC) fabrics with IP networks.
The Internet Standard Management Framework
For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current Internet Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of RFC 3410 [RFC3410].
Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed the Management Information Base or MIB.
MIB objects are generally accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the Structure of Management Information (SMI).
This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58, RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58
, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
Overview of FCIP Management Model Note that the Fibre Channel Over TCP/IP (FCIP) Entity is fully described in [RFC3821] from a functional point of view.
A collection of multiple instances of FCIP Entities and the corresponding FC Entities, described in [FCBB2], within an SNMP Context is referred to as an FCIP device here.
This section describes FCIP from a management point of view.
The FCIP device provides an IP based interconnection model for interconnecting FC fabric elements.
In this model, the FCIP devices along with the IP network on which they are running provide a new FCIP transport network.
This IP based FCIP Interconnection Model supports the following topology: The FCIP based transport network is formed by interconnecting the FCIP devices.
Each FCIP device has one or more FCIP Entities or Instances.
Peer FCIP Entities are connected by FCIP Links attached to VE ports/B Access.
Each FCIP Link Endpoint contains one or more Data Engines.
The FCIP device can work as a stand alone box or as part of a FC fabric element.
Each FCIP Entity managed by this MIB is referred to as an FCIP Instance.
The MIB is broken up as follows: 2.1.
The FCIP Entity table contains information about this entity's existing instances of FCIP entities.
The FCIP link table contains information about this FCIP device's existing FCIP links.
The FCIP TCP Connection table contains information about existing TCP connections.
Each FCIP link within an FCIP entity contains one or more TCP connections.
The FCIP entity employs a Data Engine for each TCP connection for handling FC frame encapsulation, de encapsulation, and transmission of FCIP frames on the connection.
The FCIP dynamic route table contains routing information that is dynamically discovered by this FCIP device.
The FCIP device may use the SLPv2 protocol [RFC3822] in conjunction with other protocols, such as Fabric Shortest Path First (FSPF), to dynamically discover other FCIP entities and populate this table to map destination domains to FCIP Links.
The FCIP static route table contains routing information that is statically configured into this FCIP device by the Network Admin.
In the absence of dynamic discovery of remote FCIP entities, the Network Manager can configure remote domains and FCIP Entities that are reachable by this device into this table.
At any point in time, both the static and dynamic routing tables can be active.
If a DID is present in both tables, information in the static route table will take precedence over the entry in the dynamic route table for the same DID.
The FCIP Discovery Domain Table maps this device's FCIP Entities into FCIP Discovery Domains.
The FCIP Link Errors Table contains counters that indicate error conditions on an FCIP Link.
Relationship to Other MIBs Objects accessible from other MIB modules applicable to FCIP devices have not been included in this MIB module.
The following subsections list all applicable MIB modules that should be present with FCIP  MGMT MIB.
Relationship to the 'TCP' Group
This group is mandatory for all systems that implement TCP.
Objects relevant to TCP must be obtained from this group [RFC4022].
Relationship to the 'interfaces' MIB
The 'interfaces' group is defined as being mandatory for all systems and contains information on an entity's interfaces.
Each logical/virtual interface created as an FCIP Link should be represented as a row in the ifTable with a unique ifIndex value and a value of ifType 'fcipLink' (224) for each such interface.
For a complete list of interface types, refer to the IANA registry at "http://www.iana.org/assignments/smi numbers".
These are the only ifIndex values of relevance to an FCIP Entity because FCIP runs on top of TCP/IP.
Thus, by definition, there is no ifTable interface directly beneath it, and so ifStackLowerLayer is always 0.
For any protocol using FCIP (i.e., above FCIP), FCIP appears to be a regular FC interface.
As stated in [RFC4044], a regular "FC interface will typically have no other ifTable rows stacked on top of it", and thus, ifStackHigherLayer is typically zero.
Relationship to the Fibre Channel Management MIB
The Fibre Channel Management MIB [RFC4044] is assumed for FC functionality managed objects.
Specific Interface Group MIB Objects
The following table provides specific implementation guidelines for applying the objects defined in the Interfaces Group MIB to FCIP Links.
For those objects not listed here, refer to their generic definitions in [RFC2863].
There is no physical address corresponding to an FCIP Link (only World Wide Name, WWN).
The value 'dormant' has no meaning for FCIP Links.
These counters are not incremented.
The following MIB module has IMPORTS from [RFC2578], [RFC2579], [RFC4001], [RFC4044], [RFC2863], [RFC2580], and [RFC3411].
In REFERENCE clauses, it refers to [FC SW 3], [RFC3821], [RFC2883], [RFC1323], [RFC2474] and [RFC3822].

There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB that have a MAX ACCESS clause of read write and/or read create.
Such objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.
The support for SET operations in a non secure environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on network operations.
In particular, write access to fcipDiscoveryDomainName and fcipEntityAddress can cause a loss of reachability to portions of the Fibre Channel fabric, while write access to fcipStaticRouteStatus can create incorrect routes to remote devices.
There are a number of managed objects in this MIB that contain what could be considered as sensitive information.
In particular, the objects which provide information on identification and network topology: fcipDeviceWWN, fcipEntityName, fcipEntityAddress, fcipLinkLocalFcipEntityAddress, fcipLinkRemFcipEntityWWN, and fcipLinkRemFcipEntityAddress   information on identification; fcipDiscoveryDomainName   information on discovery domains; fcipDynamicRouteLinkIndex   information on dynamic routes; fcipStaticRouteLinkIndex and fcipStaticRouteStatus   information on static routes SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec), even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is allowed to access and
the objects in this MIB module.
It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8), including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for authentication and privacy).
Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT RECOMMENDED.
Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to enable cryptographic security.
It is then a customer/operator responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate rights to indeed GET or SET
The IANA has assigned a MIB OID assignment under the transmission branch.
Specifically, { transmission 224 } for fcipMIB since this MIB contains the media specific definitions that correspond to the ifType value of fcipLink(224).
