  - "Abstract\n   National Bibliography Numbers (NBNs) are used by national libraries\n\
    \   and other organizations in order to identify resources in their\n   collections.\
    \  NBNs are usually applied to resources that are not\n   catered for by established\
    \ (standard) identifier systems such as\n   International Standard Book Number\
    \ (ISBN).\n   A Uniform Resource Name (URN) namespace for NBNs was established\
    \ in\n   2001 in RFC 3188.  Since then, a number of European national\n   libraries\
    \ have implemented URN:NBN-based systems.\n   This document replaces RFC 3188\
    \ and defines how NBNs can be supported\n   within the updated URN framework.\
    \  A revised namespace registration\n   (version 4) compliant to RFC 8141 is included.\n"

- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   One of the basic permanent Uniform Resource Identifier (URI)\
    \ schemes\n   (cf. [RFC3986] and [IANA-URI]) is Uniform Resource Name (URN). \
    \ URNs\n   were originally defined in RFC 2141 [RFC2141].  In 2017, a revision\n\
    \   was adopted with new definitions and registration procedures\n   [RFC8141].\
    \  Any traditional identifier, when used within the URN\n   system, must have\
    \ a namespace of its own that is registered with IANA\n   [IANA-URN].  National\
    \ Bibliography Number (NBN) is one such\n   namespace, specified in 2001 in RFC\
    \ 3188 [RFC3188].\n   This document describes the syntax and usage of NBN URNs\
    \ and updates\n   the registration of the associated URN namespace.  This document\n\
    \   additionally describes certain policy assumptions about how national\n   libraries\
    \ and their partner organizations partition, delegate, and\n   manage the namespace.\
    \  Violation of those assumptions could impact\n   the utility of the NBN URN\
    \ namespace.\n   URN:NBNs are in production use in several European countries\n\
    \   including (in alphabetical order) Austria, Finland, Germany, Hungary,\n  \
    \ Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, and Switzerland.  The URN:NBN\n   namespace\
    \ is collectively managed by these national libraries.  URN:\n   NBNs have been\
    \ applied to diverse content including Web archives,\n   digitized materials,\
    \ research data, and doctoral dissertations.  They\n   can be used by national\
    \ libraries and organizations cooperating with\n   them.\n   As a part of the\
    \ initial development of the URN system in the late\n   1990s, the IETF URN Working\
    \ Group agreed that it was important to\n   demonstrate that the URN syntax can\
    \ accommodate existing identifier\n   systems.  RFC 2288 [RFC2288] investigated\
    \ the feasibility of using\n   ISBN, ISSN, and SICI (Serial Item and Contribution\
    \ Identifier) as\n   URNs, with positive results; however, it did not formally\
    \ register\n   corresponding URN namespaces.  (For further discussion of how these\n\
    \   systems have evolved as URNs, see RFC 8254 [RFC8254].)  This was in\n   part\
    \ due to the still-evolving process to formalize criteria for\n   namespace definition\
    \ documents and registration.  The criteria were\n   consolidated later in the\
    \ IETF, first in RFC 2611 [RFC2611], then RFC\n   3406 [RFC3406], and now RFC\
    \ 8141 [RFC8141].\n   URN namespaces have been registered for NBN, ISBN, and ISSN\
    \ in RFCs\n   3188 [RFC3188], 3187 [RFC3187], and 3044 [RFC3044], respectively.\n\
    \   ISBN and ISSN namespaces were made compliant with RFC 8141 [RFC8141]\n   in\
    \ 2017 by publishing revised ISSN [ISSN-namespace] and ISBN\n   [ISBN-namespace]\
    \ namespace registrations.\n   The term \"National Bibliography Number\" encompasses\
    \ persistent local\n   identifier systems that national libraries and their partner\n\
    \   organizations use in addition to the more formally (and\n   internationally)\
    \ established identifiers.  These partner\n   organizations include universities\
    \ and their libraries and other\n   subsidiaries, other research institutions,\
    \ plus governmental and\n   public organizations.  Some national libraries maintain\
    \ a significant\n   number of these liaison relationships; for instance, the German\n\
    \   National Library had almost 400 by early 2018 [NBN-Resolving].\n   In practice,\
    \ NBN differs from standard identifier systems such as\n   ISBN and ISSN because\
    \ it is not a single identifier system with\n   standard-specified scope and syntax.\
    \  Each NBN implementer creates\n   its own system with its own syntax and assignment\
    \ rules.  Each user\n   organization is also obliged to keep track of how NBNs\
    \ are being\n   used; however, within the generic framework set in this document,\n\
    \   local NBN assignment policies may vary considerably.\n   Historically, NBNs\
    \ have been applied in the national bibliographies\n   to identify the resources\
    \ catalogued into them.  Prior to the\n   emergence of bibliographic standard\
    \ identifiers in the early 1970s,\n   national libraries assigned NBNs to all\
    \ catalogued publications.\n   Since the late 1990s, the NBN scope has been extended\
    \ to cover a vast\n   range of resources, both originally digital and digitized.\
    \  Only a\n   small subset of these resources is catalogued in the national\n\
    \   bibliographies or other bibliographic databases.  Digitized resources\n  \
    \ and their component parts (such as still images in books or journal\n   articles)\
    \ are examples of resources that may get NBNs.\n   It is possible to extend the\
    \ scope of the NBN much further.  The\n   National Library of Finland is using\
    \ them in the Finnish National\n   Ontology Service Finto to identify corporate\
    \ names (see\n   <http://finto.fi/cn/en/>).  Using NBNs to identify metadata elements\n\
    \   provides a stable basis for creation of linked data.\n   Simple guidelines\
    \ for using NBNs as URNs and the original namespace\n   registration were published\
    \ in RFC 3188 [RFC3188].  The RFC at hand\n   replaces RFC 3188; sections discussing\
    \ the methods by which URN:NBNs\n   should be resolved have been updated, unused\
    \ features have been\n   eliminated, and the text is compliant with the stipulations\
    \ of the\n   revised URN specification [RFC8141].\n"

- title: 3.1.  The URN:NBN Namespace
  contents:
  - "3.1.  The URN:NBN Namespace\n   NBNs are widely used to identify both hand-held\
    \ and digital resources\n   in the collections of national libraries and other\
    \ institutions that\n   are responsible for preserving the cultural heritage of\
    \ their\n   constituents.  Resources in these collections are usually preserved\n\
    \   for a long time (i.e., for centuries).  While the preferred methods\n   for\
    \ digital preservation may vary over time and depend on the\n   content, the favorite\
    \ one has been migration.  Whenever necessary, a\n   resource in an outdated file\
    \ format is migrated into a more modern\n   file format.  To the extent possible,\
    \ all old versions of the\n   resource are also kept in order to alleviate the\
    \ negative effects of\n   partially successful migrations and the gradual loss\
    \ of original look\n   and feel that may accompany even fully successful migrations.\
    \  When\n   NBN is used to identify manifestations and there are many of them\
    \ for\n   a single work, local policy can require that each manifestation ought\n\
    \   to have its own NBN.\n   NBNs are typically used to identify objects for which\
    \ standard\n   identifiers such as ISBN are not applicable.  However, NBNs can\
    \ be\n   used for component resources even when the resource as a whole\n   qualifies\
    \ for a standard identifier.  For instance, if a digitized\n   book has an ISBN,\
    \ JPEG image files of its pages might be assigned\n   NBNs.  These URN:NBNs can\
    \ be used as persistent links to the pages.\n   The scope of standard identifier\
    \ systems such as ISBN and ISSN is\n   limited; they are applicable only to certain\
    \ kinds of resources.  One\n   of the roles of the NBN is to fill in the gaps\
    \ left by the standard\n   identifiers.  Collectively, these identifiers and NBNs\
    \ cover all\n   resources that national libraries and their partners need to include\n\
    \   in their collections.\n   Section 4 below, and particularly Section 4.1, present\
    \ a more\n   detailed overview of the structure of the NBN namespace, related\n\
    \   institutions, and the identifier assignment principles used.\n"
- title: 3.2.  Community Considerations for NBNs
  contents:
  - "3.2.  Community Considerations for NBNs\n   National libraries are the key organizations\
    \ providing persistent URN\n   resolution services for resources identified with\
    \ NBNs, independent\n   of their form.  As coordinators of NBN usage, national\
    \ libraries have\n   allowed other organizations, such as university libraries\
    \ or\n   governmental organizations, to assign NBNs to the resources these\n \
    \  organizations preserve for the long term.  In such case, the national\n   library\
    \ coordinates the use of NBNs at the national level.  National\n   libraries can\
    \ also provide URN resolution services and technical\n   services to other NBN\
    \ users.  These organizations are expected to\n   either establish their own URN\
    \ resolution services or use the\n   technical infrastructure provided by the\
    \ national library.  URN:NBNs\n   are expected to be resolvable and support one\
    \ or more resolution\n   services.\n   Although NBNs can be used to identify component\
    \ resources, the NBN\n   namespace does not specify a generic, intrinsic syntax\
    \ for doing\n   that.  However, there are at least two different ways in which\n\
    \   component resources can be taken into account within the NBN\n   namespace.\n\
    \   The simplest and probably the most common approach is to assign a\n   separate\
    \ NBN for each component resource, such as a file containing a\n   digitized page\
    \ of a book, and make no provisions to make such NBNs\n   discernible in a systematic\
    \ way from others.\n   Second, if the stipulations of the URI generic syntax [RFC3986]\
    \ and\n   the Internet media type specification [RFC2046] are met, in\n   accordance\
    \ with the provisions in RFC 8141 [RFC8141], the URN\n   f-component can be attached\
    \ to URN:NBNs in order to indicate the\n   desired location within the resource\
    \ supplied by URN resolution.\n   From the library community point of view, it\
    \ is important that the\n   f-component is not a part of the Namespace-Specific\
    \ String (NSS), and\n   therefore f-component attachment does not mean that the\
    \ relevant\n   component part is identified.  Moreover, the resolution process\
    \ still\n   retrieves the entire resource even if there is an f-component.  The\n\
    \   component part selection is applied by the resolution client (e.g.,\n   browser)\
    \ to the resource returned by the resolution process.  In\n   other words, in\
    \ this latter case the component parts are just logical\n   and physical parts\
    \ of the identified resource whereas in the former\n   cases they are independently\
    \ named entities.\n   Resources identified by NBNs are not always available in\
    \ the\n   Internet.  If one is not, the URN:NBN can resolve to a surrogate such\n\
    \   as a metadata record describing the identified resource.\n   Section 4 below,\
    \ and particularly Section 4.4, presents a detailed\n   overview of the application\
    \ of the URN:NBN namespace as well as the\n   principles of, and systems used\
    \ for, the resolution of NBN-based\n   URNs.\n"

- title: 4.1.  Assignment
  contents:
  - "4.1.  Assignment\n   National Bibliography Number (NBN) is a generic term referring\
    \ to a\n   group of identifier systems administered by national libraries and\n\
    \   institutions authorized by them.  The NBN assignment is typically\n   performed\
    \ by the organization hosting the resource.  National\n   libraries are committed\
    \ to permanent preservation of their deposit\n   collections.\n   Assignment of\
    \ NBN-based URNs is controlled on a national level by the\n   national library\
    \ (or national libraries, if there is more than one).\n   National guidelines\
    \ can differ, but the identified resources\n   themselves are usually persistent.\n\
    \   Different national URN:NBN assignment policies have resulted in\n   varying\
    \ levels of control of the assignment process.  Manual URN:NBN\n   assignment\
    \ by the library personnel provides the tightest control,\n   especially if the\
    \ URN:NBNs cover only resources catalogued into the\n   national bibliography.\
    \  In most national libraries, the scope of\n   URN:NBN is already much broader\
    \ than this.  Usage rules can vary\n   within one country, from one URN:NBN sub-namespace\
    \ to the next.\n   Each national library uses NBNs independently of other national\n\
    \   libraries; apart from this document, there are no guidelines that\n   specify\
    \ or control NBN usage.  As such, NBNs are unique only on the\n   national level.\
    \  When used as URNs, base NBN strings MUST be\n   augmented with a controlled\
    \ prefix, which is the particular nation's\n   ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 two-letter country\
    \ code (referred to as \"ISO\n   country code\" below) [ISO3166-1].  These prefixes\
    \ guarantee\n   uniqueness of the URN:NBNs at the global scale [ISO3166MA].\n\
    \   National libraries using URN:NBNs usually specify local assignment\n   policies\
    \ for themselves.  Such policy can limit the URN:NBN usage to,\n   e.g., the resources\
    \ stored in the national library's digital\n   collections or databases.  Although\
    \ this specification does not\n   specify principles for URN:NBN assignment policies\
    \ that can be\n   applied, NBNs assigned to short-lived resources should not be\
    \ made\n   URN:NBNs unless such policy can be justified.\n   URN:NBN assignment\
    \ policy can clarify, for instance, the local policy\n   concerning identifier\
    \ assignment to component parts of resources and\n   can specify, with sufficient\
    \ detail, the syntax of local component\n   identifiers (if there is one as a\
    \ discernible part of the NBNs).  The\n   policy can also cover any employed extensions\
    \ to the default NBN\n   scope.\n   NBNs as such are locally but not globally\
    \ unique; two national\n   libraries can assign the same NBN to different resources.\
    \  A prefix,\n   based on the ISO country code as described above, guarantees\
    \ the\n   global uniqueness of URN:NBNs.  Once an NBN has been assigned to a\n\
    \   resource, it MUST be persistent, and therefore URN:NBNs are\n   persistent\
    \ as well.\n   A URN:NBN, once it has been generated from a NBN, MUST NOT be reused\n\
    \   for another resource.\n   Users of the URN:NBN namespace MUST ensure that\
    \ they do not assign\n   the same URN:NBN twice.  Different policies can be applied\
    \ to\n   guarantee this.  For instance, NBNs and corresponding URN:NBNs can be\n\
    \   assigned sequentially by programs in order to avoid human mistakes.\n   It\
    \ is also possible to use printable representations of checksums\n   such as SHA-1\
    \ [RFC6234] as NBNs.\n"
- title: 4.2.  Syntax
  contents:
  - "4.2.  Syntax\n   The Namespace-Specific String (NSS) will consist of three parts:\n\
    \   o  a prefix consisting of an ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country code and\n      optional\
    \ sub-namespace code(s) separated by a colon(s);\n   o  a hyphen (-) as the delimiting\
    \ character; and,\n   o  an NBN string assigned by the national library or sub-delegated\n\
    \      authority.\n   The following formal definition uses ABNF [RFC5234].\n \
    \   nbn-nss     = prefix \"-\" nbn-string\n    prefix      = iso-cc *( \":\" subspc\

    \ be\n                ; taken into account.\n   A colon SHOULD be used within\
    \ the prefix only as a delimiting\n   character between the ISO 3166-1 country\
    \ code and sub-namespace\n   code(s), which splits the national namespace into\
    \ smaller parts.\n   The structure (if any) of the nbn_string is determined by\
    \ the\n   authority for the prefix.  Whereas the prefix is regarded as case\n\
    \   insensitive, NBN strings can be case sensitive at the preference of\n   the\
    \ assigning authority; parsers therefore MUST treat these as case\n   sensitive,\
    \ and any case mapping needed to introduce case\n   insensitivity is the responsibility\
    \ of the relevant resolution\n   system.\n   A hyphen SHOULD be used as the delimiting\
    \ character between the\n   prefix and the NBN string.  Within the NBN string,\
    \ a hyphen MAY be\n   used for separating different sections of the identifier\
    \ from one\n   another.\n   All two-letter codes are reserved by the ISO 3166\
    \ Maintenance Agency\n   for either existing or possible future ISO country codes\
    \ (or for\n   private use).\n   Sub-namespace identifiers MUST be registered on\
    \ the national level by\n   the national library that assigned the identifier.\
    \  The list of such\n   identifiers can be made publicly available via the Web.\n\
    \   Note that because case mapping for ASCII letters is completely\n   reversible\
    \ and does not lose information, the case used in case-\n   insensitive matching\
    \ is a local matter.  Implementations can convert\n   to lower or upper case as\
    \ they see fit; they only need to do it\n   consistently.\n"

    \ and the media type of\n   the resource supports f-component usage, it can be\
    \ used to indicate a\n   location within the identified resource.  Persistence\
    \ is achieved if\n   the URN:NBN is assigned to one and only one version of a\
    \ resource,\n   such as a PDF/A version of a book.\n   The URN:NBN namespace does\

  contents:
  - "4.3.  Encoding Considerations and Lexical Equivalence\n   Expressing NBNs as\
    \ URNs is usually straightforward, as normally only\n   ASCII characters are used\
    \ in NBN strings.  If this is not the case,\n   non-ASCII characters in NBNs MUST\
    \ be translated into canonical form\n   as specified in RFC 8141.  If a national\
    \ library uses NBNs that can\n   contain percent-encoded characters higher than\
    \ U+007F, the library\n   needs to carefully define the canonical transformation\
    \ from these\n   NBNs into URNs, including normalization forms.\n   When an NBN\
    \ is used as a URN, the NSS MUST consist of three parts:\n   o  a prefix, structured\
    \ as a primary prefix, which is a two-letter\n      ISO 3166-1 country code of\
    \ the library's country, and zero or more\n      secondary prefixes that are each\
    \ indicated by a delimiting colon\n      character (:) and a sub-namespace identifier;\n\
    \   o  a hyphen (-) as a delimiting character; and,\n   o  the NBN string.\n \
    \  Different delimiting characters are not semantically equivalent.\n   The syntax\
    \ and roles of the three parts listed above are described in\n   Section 4.2.\n\
    \   If there are several national libraries in one country, these\n   libraries\
    \ MUST agree on how to divide the national namespace between\n   themselves using\
    \ this method before the URN:NBN assignment begins in\n   any of these libraries.\n\
    \   A national library MAY also assign URN:NBN sub-namespaces to trusted\n   organizations\
    \ such as universities or government institutions.  The\n   sub-namespace MAY\
    \ be further divided by the partner organization.\n   All sub-namespace identifiers\
    \ used within a country-code-based\n   namespace MUST be registered on the national\
    \ level by the national\n   library that assigned the code.  The national register\
    \ of these codes\n   SHOULD be made available online.\n   Being part of the prefix,\
    \ sub-namespace identifier strings are case-\n   insensitive.  They MUST NOT contain\
    \ any colons or hyphens.\n   Formally, two URN:NBNs are lexically equivalent if\
    \ they are octet-\n   by-octet equal after the following (conceptional) preprocessing:\n\
    \   1.  convert all characters in the leading \"urn:nbn:\" token to a\n      \
    \ single case;\n   2.  convert all characters in the prefix (country code and\
    \ its\n       optional sub-divisions) to a single case; and,\n   3.  convert all\
    \ characters embedded in any percent-encodings to a\n       single case.\n   Models\
    \ (indicated line break inserted for readability):\n      URN:NBN:<ISO 3166 alpha-2\
    \ country code>-<assigned NBN string>\n      URN:NBN:<ISO 3166 alpha-2 country\
    \ code>:<sub-namespace code>-\\\n      <assigned NBN string>\n   Examples:\n \

- title: 4.4.  Resolution and Persistence of NBN-based URNs
  contents:
  - "4.4.  Resolution and Persistence of NBN-based URNs\n   Eventually, URNs might\
    \ be resolved with the help of a Global Resolver\n   Discovery Service (GRDS),\
    \ and URN:NBN syntax makes it possible to\n   locate the relevant resolver.  Since\
    \ no GRDS system has been\n   installed yet in the Internet, URN:NBNs are embedded\
    \ in HTTP URIs in\n   order to make them actionable in the present Internet. \
    \ In these HTTP\n   URIs, the authority part must point to the appropriate URN\
    \ resolution\n   service.  For instance, in Finland, the address of the national\
    \ URN\n   resolver is <http://urn.fi>.  Thus, the HTTP URI for the Finnish URN\n\
    \   in the example above is <http://urn.fi/URN:NBN:fi-fe201003181510>.\n   The\
    \ country-code-based prefix part of the URN:NBN namespace-specific\n   string\
    \ will provide a hint needed to find the correct resolution\n   service for URN:NBNs\
    \ from the GRDS when it is established.\n   There are three interrelated aspects\
    \ of persistence that need to be\n   discussed: persistence of the objects itself,\
    \ persistence of the\n   identifier, and persistence of the URN resolvers.\n \
    \  NBNs have traditionally been assigned to printed resources, which\n   tend\
    \ to be persistent.  In contrast, digital resources require\n   frequent migrations\
    \ to guarantee accessibility.  Although it is\n   impossible to estimate how often\
    \ migrations are needed, hardware and\n   software upgrades take place frequently,\
    \ and a lifetime exceeding\n   10-20 years can be considered as long.\n   However,\
    \ it is a common practice to keep also the original and\n   previously migrated\
    \ versions of resources.  Therefore, even outdated\n   versions of resources can\
    \ be available in digital archives, no matter\n   how old or difficult to use\
    \ they have become.\n   If all versions of a resource are kept, a user who requires\n\
    \   authenticity can retrieve the original version of the resource,\n   whereas\
    \ a user to whom the ease of use is a priority is likely to be\n   satisfied with\
    \ the latest version.  In order to enable the users to\n   find the best match,\
    \ a national library can link all manifestations\n   of a resource to each other\
    \ so as to make a user aware of them.\n   Thus, even if specific versions of digital\
    \ resources are not normally\n   persistent, persistent identifiers such as URN:NBNs\
    \ support\n   information architectures that enable persistent access to any\n\
    \   version of the resource, including ones that can only be utilized by\n   using\
    \ digital archaeology tools such as custom-made applications to\n   render the\
    \ resource.\n   Persistence of URN resolvers themselves is mainly an organizational\n\
    \   issue that is related to the persistence of organizations maintaining\n  \
    \ them.  As URN:NBN resolution services will be supplied (primarily) by\n   the\
    \ national libraries, these services are likely to be long lived.\n"
- title: 4.5.  Additional Considerations
  contents:
  - "4.5.  Additional Considerations\n   It is a good idea to apply URN:NBNs (or other\
    \ persistent identifiers)\n   to all resources that have been prioritized in the\
    \ organization's\n   digital preservation plan.\n   Assignment of URN:NBNs to\
    \ resources that are known to not be\n   persistent should be considered carefully.\
    \  URN:NBNs can, however, be\n   applied to resources that have a low-level preservation\
    \ priority and\n   will not be migrated to more modern file formats or preserved\
    \ via\n   emulation.\n   If the identified version of a resource has disappeared,\
    \ the\n   resolution process can supply a surrogate if one exists.  A surrogate\n\
    \   can be, for instance, a more modern digital version of the original\n   electronic\
    \ resource.\n"
