    \ for XHTML+Voice multimodal language documents.\n"
- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   XHTML+Voice is a member of the XHTML family of document\
    \ types, as\n   specified by XHTML Modularization [4].  XHTML+Voice extends XHTML\
    \ 1.1\n   [5] with a modularized subset of VoiceXML 2.0 [9], XML Events [7],\n\
    \   and a few extensions to both XHTML and VoiceXML 2.0.  XHTML 1.1,\n   VoiceXML\
    \ 2.0, and XML Events are W3C Recommendations.\n   The language integration defined\
    \ by XHTML+Voice supports all modules\n   defined by XHTML Modularization and\
    \ adds voice interaction to XHTML\n   elements in order to enable multimodal applications.\
    \  The defined\n   document type for XHTML+Voice is XHTML Host language document\
    \ type\n   conformant.\n   XHTML+Voice 1.2 [8] is maintained by the VoiceXML Forum,\
    \ at URI\n   location <http://www.voicexml.org/specs/multimodal/x+v/12/>.\n"
- title: 1.1.  application/xv+xml Usage
  contents:
  - "1.1.  application/xv+xml Usage\n   The application/xv+xml media type is intended\
    \ to be a media\n   descriptor for XHTML+Voice multimodal documents.  It is used\
    \ to\n   inform applications that additional markup for running a voice\n   browser\
    \ component and activating handlers for DOM Level 2 events [6]\n   via XML Events\
    \ [7] can be processed.\n   This media type registration is not intended for e-mail\
    \ usage.\n"
- title: 2.  IANA Registration
  contents:
  - "2.  IANA Registration\n      To: ietf-types@iana.org\n      Subject: Registration\
    \ of MIME media type\n               application/xv+xml\n      MIME media type\
    \ name: application\n      MIME subtype name: xv+xml\n      Required parameters:\
    \ none\n      Optional parameters:\n      charset: has the same semantics as the\
    \ charset parameter of the\n      \"application/xml\" media type specified in\
    \ [1].\n   Encoding considerations:\n      XHTML+Voice has the same media type\
    \ encoding considerations\n      specified in Section 3.2 of [1].\n   Security\
    \ considerations:\n      XHTML+Voice is an extension of XHTML and has the same\
    \ security\n      issues as XHTML.  These include interpreting anchors and forms\
    \ in\n      XHTML documents, and scripting languages and other dynamic\n     \
    \ interactive capabilities.  See Section 7 of [2].\n      In addition, the scripting\
    \ language can be accessed by both the\n      XHTML and the VoiceXML 2.0 markup\
    \ embedded in the XHTML+Voice\n      document.  See Section 1.3.1.5 of [8].\n\
    \      XML-Events [7] allows an author to attach a handler to any node in\n  \
    \    the document.  The handler that is activated in response to a\n      specified\
    \ event may be either a voice dialog or a script that can\n      be in either\
    \ the same or an external document.\n   Interoperability considerations:\n   \
    \   Because XHTML+Voice is built upon W3C standard recommendations, it\n     \
    \ is designed to be interoperable across a wide range of platforms\n      and\
    \ client devices.  Because the extensions to XHTML are\n      identified by their\
    \ namespaces, all browsers that have namespace\n      support can run an XHTML+Voice\
    \ document as an XHTML document\n      without voice interaction.\n   Published\
    \ specification:\n      The latest published version of XHTML+Voice is [8].\n\
    \   Applications which use this media type:\n      XHTML+Voice documents are intended\
    \ to be deployed on the World\n      Wide Web and rendered by multimodal browsers\
    \ that support the\n      visual and voice modes of interaction.  Because XHTML+Voice\
    \ is an\n      application of XML, authors can expect XHTML+Voice user agents\
    \ to\n      be conformant XML 1.0 [3] processors.  See section 2 of [2].\n   Additional\
    \ information:\n      Magic number(s): There is no single string that is always\
    \ present.\n      File extension(s): mxml, xhvml, xvml, xvm\n      Macintosh File\
    \ Type Code(s): TEXT\n   Person & e-mail address to contact for further information:\n\

- title: 3.  Fragment Identifiers
  contents:
  - "3.  Fragment Identifiers\n   See Section 3 of [2].  Following [2], fragment identifiers\
    \ for XHTML+\n   Voice documents designate the element with the corresponding\
    \ ID\n   attribute value (see [3], Section 3.3.1).\n   While XHTML+Voice adds\
    \ new ID attributes with fragment identifier\n   namespaces that are not in the\
    \ same namespace as XHTML, uniqueness of\n   the ID attribute values is preserved\
    \ within the document.  See\n   sections 1.3.1 and 5.3 of [8].\n"
- title: 4.  Recognizing XHTML+Voice files
  contents:
  - "4.  Recognizing XHTML+Voice files\n   Because XHTML+Voice is XML, an XHTML+Voice\
    \ document (optionally)\n   starts with an XML declaration that begins with \"\
    <?xml\" and has a\n   DOCTYPE declaration \"<!DOCTYPE html\".  XHTML+Voice 1.2\
    \ has the\n   following DOCTYPE declaration:\n"
- title: <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//VoiceXML Forum//DTD XHTML+Voice 1.2//EN"
  contents:
  - '<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//VoiceXML Forum//DTD XHTML+Voice 1.2//EN"

  contents:
  - "\"http://www.voicexml.org/specs/multimodal/x+v/12/dtd/xhtml+voice12.dtd\">\n\
    \   Because XHTML+Voice is in the XHTML family of languages, the root\n   element\
    \ of an XHTML+Voice document is 'html', and '<html' can be\n   found near the\
    \ top of the document.\n"
