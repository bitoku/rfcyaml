- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   The Cryptographically Generated Address (CGA) specification\
    \ [1]\n   defines Extension Fields that allow additional information to be\n \
    \  included in the CGA Parameter Data Structure.  So far there seems to\n   be\
    \ enough interest in including additional data items into the CGA\n   Parameter\
    \ Data Structure through these Extension Fields that it seems\n   reasonable to\
    \ expect that more than one mechanism will require its\n   usage.  In order to\
    \ simplify the addition of multiple data items,\n   this document updates RFC\
    \ 3972 [1], and it defines a Type-Length-\n   Value format for the Extension Fields.\n"
- title: 2.  CGA Extension Field Format
  contents:
  - "2.  CGA Extension Field Format\n   Data items to be included in Extension Fields\
    \ of the CGA Parameter\n   Data Structure MUST be encoded using the following\

- title: 3.  IANA Considerations
  contents:
  - "3.  IANA Considerations\n   The IANA has created and will maintain a registry\
    \ entitled, \"CGA\n   Extension Type\".  The values in this name space are 16-bit\
    \ unsigned\n   integers.  Initial values for the CGA Extension Type field are\
    \ given\n   below; future assignments are to be made through Standards Action\n\
    \   [2].  Assignments consist of a name and the value.\n   As recommended in [3],\
    \ this document makes the following assignments\n   for experimental and testing\
    \ use: the value 0xFFFD, with name\n   Exp_FFFD; the value 0xFFFE, with name Exp_FFFE,\
    \ and the value 0xFFFF,\n   with name Exp_FFFF.\n"
- title: 4.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "4.  Security Considerations\n   No security concerns are raised by the adoption\
    \ of the CGA Extension\n   format described in this document.  However, proper\
    \ security analysis\n   is required when new CGA Extensions are defined in order\
    \ to make sure\n   that they introduce no new vulnerabilities to the existing\
    \ CGA\n   schemes.\n"
