- title: Abstract
  contents:
  - "Abstract\n   This document describes a mechanism to model a broadcast network\
    \ as a\n   hybrid of broadcast and point-to-multipoint networks for purposes of\n\
    \   OSPF operation.  Neighbor discovery and maintenance as well as Link\n   State\
    \ Advertisement (LSA) database synchronization are performed\n   using the broadcast\
    \ model, but the network is represented using the\n   point-to-multipoint model\
    \ in the router-LSAs of the routers connected\n   to it.  This allows an accurate\
    \ representation of the cost of\n   communication between different routers on\
    \ the network, while\n   maintaining the network efficiency of broadcast operation.\
    \  This\n   approach is relatively simple and requires minimal changes to OSPF.\n\
    \   This document updates both OSPFv2 (RFC 2328) and OSPFv3 (RFC 5340).\n"

  - "1.  Introduction\n   OSPF [RFC2328] operation on broadcast interfaces takes advantage\
    \ of\n   the broadcast capabilities of the underlying medium for doing\n   neighbor\
    \ discovery and maintenance.  Further, it uses a Designated\n   Router (DR) and\
    \ Backup Designated Router (BDR) to keep the Link State\n   Advertisement (LSA)\
    \ databases of the routers on the network\n   synchronized in an efficient manner.\
    \  However, it has the limitation\n   that a router cannot advertise different\
    \ costs to each of the\n   neighboring routers on the network in its router-LSA.\n\
    \   Consider a radio network that supports true broadcast, yet the\n   metrics\
    \ between different pairs of terminals could be different for\n   various reasons\
    \ (e.g., different signal strength due to placement).\n   When running OSPF over\
    \ the radio network, for a router to advertise\n   different costs to different\
    \ neighbors, the interface must be treated\n   as point-to-multipoint (P2MP),\
    \ even though the network has true\n   broadcast capability.\n   Operation on\
    \ point-to-multipoint interfaces could require explicit\n   configuration of the\
    \ identity of neighboring routers.  It also\n   requires the router to send separate\
    \ Hellos to each neighbor on the\n   network.  Further, it mandates establishment\
    \ of adjacencies to all\n   configured or discovered neighbors on the network.\
    \  However, it gives\n   the routers the flexibility to advertise different costs\
    \ to each of\n   the neighboring routers in their router-LSAs.\n   This document\
    \ proposes a new interface type that can be used on\n   networks that have broadcast\
    \ capability.  In this mode, neighbor\n   discovery and maintenance, as well as\
    \ database synchronization are\n   performed using existing procedures for broadcast\
    \ mode.  The network\n   is modeled as a collection of point-to-point links in\
    \ the router-LSA,\n   just as it would be in point-to-multipoint mode.  This new\
    \ interface\n   type is referred to as hybrid-broadcast-and-P2MP in the rest of\
    \ this\n   document.\n"

  contents:
  - "2.  Requirements Language\n   The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\"\
    , \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"\
    MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n   document are to be interpreted as described\
    \ in [RFC2119].\n"
- title: 3.  Motivation
  contents:
  - "3.  Motivation\n   There are some networks that are broadcast capable but have\
    \ a\n   potentially different cost associated with communication between any\n\
    \   given pair of nodes.  The cost could be based on the underlying\n   topology\
    \ as well as various link quality metrics such as bandwidth,\n   delay, and jitter,\
    \ among others.\n   It is not accurate to treat such networks as OSPF broadcast\
    \ networks\n   since that does not allow a router to advertise a different cost\
    \ to\n   each of the other routers.  Using OSPF point-to-multipoint mode would\n\
    \   satisfy the requirement to correctly describe the cost to reach each\n   router.\
    \  However, it would be inefficient in the sense that it would\n   require forming\
    \ O(N^2) adjacencies when there are N routers on the\n   network.\n   It is advantageous\
    \ to use the hybrid-broadcast-and-P2MP type for such\n   networks.  This combines\
    \ the flexibility of point-to-multipoint type\n   with the advantages and efficiencies\
    \ of broadcast interface type.\n"
- title: 4.  Operation
  contents:
  - "4.  Operation\n   OSPF routers supporting the capabilities described herein should\
    \ have\n   support for an additional hybrid-broadcast-and-P2MP type for the Type\n\
    \   data item described in Section 9 of [RFC2328].\n   The following sub-sections\
    \ describe salient aspects of OSPF operation\n   on routers configured with a\
    \ hybrid-broadcast-and-P2MP interface.\n"
- title: 4.1.  Interface Parameters
  contents:
  - "4.1.  Interface Parameters\n   The \"Router Priority\" interface parameter as\
    \ specified in OSPFv2\n   [RFC2328] and OSPFv3 [RFC5340] applies to a hybrid-broadcast-and-P2MP\n\
    \   interface.\n   The \"LinkLSASuppression\" interface parameter as specified\
    \ in OSPFv3\n   [RFC5340] applies to a hybrid-broadcast-and-P2MP interface.  The\n\
    \   default value is \"disabled\".  It may be set to \"enabled\" via\n   configuration.\n"
- title: 4.2.  Neighbor Data Structure
  contents:
  - "4.2.  Neighbor Data Structure\n   An additional field called the Neighbor Output\
    \ Cost is added to the\n   neighbor data structure.  This is the cost of sending\
    \ a data packet\n   to the neighbor, expressed in the link state metric.  The\
    \ default\n   value of this field is the Interface output cost.  It may be set\
    \ to a\n   different value using mechanisms that are outside the scope of this\n\
    \   document, like static per-neighbor configuration, or any dynamic\n   discovery\
    \ mechanism that is supported by the underlying network.\n"
- title: 4.3.  Neighbor Discovery and Maintenance
  contents:
  - "4.3.  Neighbor Discovery and Maintenance\n   Routers send and receive Hellos\
    \ so as to perform neighbor discovery\n   and maintenance on the interface using\
    \ the procedures specified for\n   broadcast interfaces in [RFC2328] and [RFC5340].\n"
- title: 4.4.  Database Synchronization
  contents:
  - "4.4.  Database Synchronization\n   Routers elect a DR and BDR for the interface\
    \ and use them for initial\n   and ongoing database synchronization using the\
    \ procedures specified\n   for broadcast interfaces in [RFC2328] and [RFC5340].\n"
- title: 4.5.  Generating Network-LSAs
  contents:
  - "4.5.  Generating Network-LSAs\n   Since a hybrid-broadcast-and-P2MP interface\
    \ is described in router-\n   LSAs using a collection of point-to-point links,\
    \ the DR MUST NOT\n   generate a network-LSA for the interface.\n"
- title: 4.6.  Generating Router and Intra-Area-Prefix-LSAs
  contents:
  - "4.6.  Generating Router and Intra-Area-Prefix-LSAs\n   Routers describe the interface\
    \ in their router-LSA as specified for a\n   point-to-multipoint interface in\
    \ Section 12.4.1.4 of [RFC2328] and\n   Section 4.4.3.2 of [RFC5340], with the\
    \ following modifications for\n   Type 1 links:\n   o  If a router is not the\
    \ DR and does not have a full adjacency to\n      the DR, it MUST NOT add any\
    \ Type 1 links.\n   o  If a router is not the DR and has a full adjacency to the\
    \ DR, and\n      both the DR and this router agree on the DR role, it MUST add\
    \ a\n      Type 1 link corresponding to each neighbor that is in state 2-Way\n\
    \      or higher and to which the DR's router-LSA includes a link.\n   o  The\
    \ cost for a Type 1 link corresponding to a neighbor SHOULD be\n      set to the\
    \ value of the Neighbor Output Cost field as defined in\n      Section 4.2.\n"
- title: 4.6.1.  Stub Links in OSPFv2 Router-LSA
  contents:
  - "4.6.1.  Stub Links in OSPFv2 Router-LSA\n   Routers MUST add a Type 3 link for\
    \ their own IP address to the\n   router-LSA as described in Section 12.4.1.4\
    \ of [RFC2328].  Further,\n   they MUST also add a Type 3 link with the Link ID\
    \ set to the IP\n   subnet address, Link Data set to the IP subnet mask, and cost\
    \ equal\n   to the configured output cost of the interface.\n"
- title: 4.6.2.  OSPFv3 Intra-Area-Prefix-LSA
  contents:
  - "4.6.2.  OSPFv3 Intra-Area-Prefix-LSA\n   Routers MUST add globally scoped IPv6\
    \ addresses on the interface to\n   the intra-area-prefix-LSA as described for\
    \ point-to-multipoint\n   interfaces in Section 4.4.3.9 of [RFC5340].  In addition,\
    \ they MUST\n   also add all globally scoped IPv6 prefixes on the interface to\
    \ the\n   LSA by specifying the PrefixLength, PrefixOptions, and Address Prefix\n\
    \   fields.  The Metric field for each of these prefixes is set to the\n   configured\
    \ output cost of the interface.\n   The DR MUST NOT generate an intra-area-prefix-LSA\
    \ for the transit\n   network for this interface since it does not generate a\
    \ network-LSA\n   for the interface.  Note that the global prefixes associated\
    \ with the\n   interface are advertised in the intra-area-prefix-LSA for the router\n\
    \   as described above.\n"
- title: 4.7.  Next-Hop Calculation
  contents:
  - "4.7.  Next-Hop Calculation\n   Next-hops to destinations that are directly connected\
    \ to a router via\n   the interface are calculated as specified for a point-to-multipoint\n\
    \   interface in Section 16.1.1 of [RFC2328].\n"
- title: 4.8.  Graceful Restart
  contents:
  - "4.8.  Graceful Restart\n   The following modifications to the procedures defined\
    \ in Section 2.2,\n   item 1, of [RFC3623] are required in order to ensure that\
    \ the router\n   correctly exits graceful restart.\n   o  If a router is the DR\
    \ on the interface, the pre-restart network-\n      LSA for the interface MUST\
    \ NOT be used to determine the previous\n      set of adjacencies.\n   o  If a\
    \ router is in state DROther on the interface, an adjacency to\n      a non-DR\
    \ or non-BDR neighbor is considered as reestablished when\n      the neighbor\
    \ state reaches 2-Way.\n"
- title: 5.  Compatibility Considerations
  contents:
  - "5.  Compatibility Considerations\n   All routers on the network must support\
    \ the hybrid-broadcast-and-P2MP\n   interface type for successful operation. \
    \ Otherwise, the interface\n   should be configured as a standard broadcast interface.\n\
    \   If some routers on the network treat the interface as broadcast and\n   others\
    \ as hybrid-broadcast-and-P2MP, neighbors and adjacencies will\n   still get formed\
    \ as for a broadcast interface.  However, due to the\n   differences in how router\
    \ and network-LSAs are built for these two\n   interface types, there will be\
    \ no traffic traversing certain pairs of\n   routers.  Note that this will not\
    \ cause any persistent loops or\n   black-holing of traffic.\n   To detect and\
    \ flag possible mismatched configurations, an\n   implementation of this specification\
    \ SHOULD log a message if a\n   network-LSA is received for a locally configured\
    \ hybrid interface.\n"
- title: 6.  Scalability and Deployment Considerations
  contents:
  - "6.  Scalability and Deployment Considerations\n   Treating a broadcast interface\
    \ as hybrid-broadcast-and-P2MP results\n   in O(N^2) links to represent the network\
    \ instead of O(N), when there\n   are N routers on the network.  This will increase\
    \ memory usage and\n   have a negative impact on route calculation performance\
    \ on all the\n   routers in the area.  Network designers should carefully weigh\
    \ the\n   benefits of using the new interface type against the disadvantages\n\
    \   mentioned here.\n"
- title: 7.  Management Considerations
  contents:
  - "7.  Management Considerations\n   The following MIB variable/value should be\
    \ added to the appropriate\n   OSPFv2 and OSPFv3 MIBs ([RFC4750], [RFC5643]).\n\
    \   o  For ospfIfType/ospfv3IfType, a new value broadcast-P2MP-hybrid (X)\n  \
    \    for the hybrid interface type (X to be defined when the revised\n      MIB\
    \ documents are approved).\n   o  For ospfNbrEntry/ospfv3NbrEntry, an ospfNbrMetricValue/\n\
