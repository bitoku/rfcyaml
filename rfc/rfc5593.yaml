  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   The IMAP URL specification [RFC5092] provides a way to carry\n\
    \   authorization information in IMAP URLs.  Several authorization\n   <access>\
    \ identifiers are specified in the document that allow\n   URLAUTH-authorized\
    \ URLs to be used only by anonymous users,\n   authenticated users, or message\
    \ submission entities.  However, there\n   is no mechanism defined to create new\
    \ <access> identifiers, and\n   overloading the existing mechanisms has security\
    \ as well as\n   administrative implications.\n   This document describes a new\
    \ <access> identifier, \"stream\", to be\n   used by message streaming entities\
    \ (as described in [STREAMING]), and\n   defines an IANA registration template,\
    \ which can be used to register\n   new <access> identifiers for future applications.\
    \  IANA definitions\n   for the existing access identifiers and prefixes from\
    \ RFC 5092 are\n   also defined in this document -- this document updates RFC\
    \ 5092 and\n   should be taken as the master in the event of any differences or\n\
    \   discrepancies.\n"

- title: 3.1.  Existing Access Identifiers
  contents:
  - "3.1.  Existing Access Identifiers\n   The IMAP URL specification [RFC5092] specifies\
    \ the following\n   authorized <access> identifiers:\n   o  \"authuser\" - Indicates\
    \ that use of this URL is limited to\n      authenticated IMAP sessions that are\
    \ logged in as any non-\n      anonymous user.\n   o  \"anonymous\" - Indicates\
    \ that use of this URL is not restricted by\n      session authorization identity.\n\
    \   Additionally, the following <access> identifier prefixes are defined\n   in\
    \ [RFC5092]:\n   o  \"submit+\" - Followed by a userid, indicates that only a\
    \ userid\n      authorized as a message submission entity on behalf of the\n \
    \     specified userid is permitted to use this URL.\n   o  \"user+\" - Followed\
    \ by a userid, indicates that use of this URL is\n      limited to IMAP sessions\
    \ that are logged in as the specified\n      userid.\n"
- title: 3.2.  Requirement for Additional Access Identifiers
  contents:
  - "3.2.  Requirement for Additional Access Identifiers\n   The existing <access>\
    \ identifiers are suitable for user-based\n   authorization, but only the \"submit+\"\
    \ <access> identifier prefix is\n   suitable for entities acting on behalf of\
    \ a user.  Generic support\n   for external entities acting on behalf of users\
    \ is required for new\n   services such as streaming [STREAMING].\n   The \"submit+\"\
    \ <access> identifier prefix is not suitable for use as a\n   general mechanism\
    \ to grant access to entities acting on behalf of\n   users, for reasons that\
    \ include:\n   o  Security - The IMAP server maintains a list of submission server\n\
    \      entities that are entitled to retrieve IMAP URLs specifying the\n     \
    \ \"submit+\" <access> identifier prefix.  If this list is extended to\n     \
    \ include the set of all external entities that could act on behalf\n      of\
    \ users, then the attack surface would be increased.\n   o  Administration - When\
    \ URLAUTH-style IMAP URLs are presented to an\n      IMAP server by entities acting\
    \ on behalf of users, the server\n      administrator has no way of determining\
    \ the intended use of that\n      URL from the server logs.\n   o  Resourcing\
    \ - Without a mechanism to distinguish between the\n      application for which\
    \ an IMAP URL is to be used, the IMAP server\n      has no way to prioritize resources\
    \ for particular applications.\n      For example, the server could prioritize\
    \ \"submit+\" URL fetch\n      requests over other access identifiers.\n"
- title: 3.3.  Additional Access Identifier Specification
  contents:
  - "3.3.  Additional Access Identifier Specification\n   The previous section establishes\
    \ that additional access identifiers\n   are required to support applications,\
    \ such as streaming [STREAMING],\n   that require entities to retrieve URLAUTH\
    \ URLs on behalf of users.\n   This section describes the scope and meaning of\
    \ any additional\n   <access> identifiers that are created.\n   Additional <access>\
    \ identifiers MUST take one of two forms (Section 4\n   gives the formal ABNF\
    \ syntax):\n   o  <access> identifier - The name of the application, e.g.,\n \
    \     \"exampleapp\".\n   o  <access> identifier prefix - The name of the application,\
    \ e.g.,\n      \"exampleapp3\", followed by a \"+\" and then a userid.  For example,\n\
    \      consider \"exampleapp3+testuser\".\n   Note that an <access> identifier\
    \ name can also be registered as an\n   <access> identifier prefix.  However,\
    \ this would require 2 separate\n   IANA registrations.\n   In both cases, the\
    \ semantics are the same as those for \"submit+\",\n   i.e., the <access> identifier\
    \ or <access> identifier prefix (which\n   MUST be followed by a userid) indicates\
    \ that only a userid authorized\n   as an application entity for the specified\
    \ application is permitted\n   to use this URL.  In the case of <access> identifier\
    \ prefixes, the\n   IMAP server SHALL NOT validate the specified userid but MUST\
    \ validate\n   that the IMAP session has an authorization identity that is\n \
    \  authorized as an application entity for the specified application.\n   The\
    \ application entity itself MAY choose to perform validation on any\n   specified\
    \ userid before attempting to retrieve the URL.\n   The authorization granted\
    \ by any <access> identifiers used as\n   described above is self-describing,\
    \ and so requires that the IMAP\n   server provide an extensible mechanism for\
    \ associating userids with\n   new applications.  For example, imagine a new application,\
    \ \"foo\", is\n   created that requires application entities to retrieve URLs\
    \ on behalf\n   of users.  In this case, the IMAP server would need to provide\
    \ a way\n   to register the new application \"foo\" and to associate the set of\n\
    \   userids to be used by those entities with the application \"foo\".  Any\n\
    \   attempt to retrieve URLs containing the <access> identifier \"foo\"\n   would\
    \ be checked for authorization against the list of userids\n   associated with\
    \ the application \"foo\".\n   Section 6 provides the template required to register\
    \ new <access>\n   identifiers or prefixes with IANA.\n"
- title: 3.4.  Defining an Access Identifier for Streaming
  contents:
  - "3.4.  Defining an Access Identifier for Streaming\n   One application that makes\
    \ use of URLAUTH-authorized URLs is that of\n   streaming multimedia files that\
    \ are received as internet-messaging\n   attachments.  This application is described\
    \ in [STREAMING].\n   See Section 6.2 for the IANA registration template for the\
    \ \"stream\"\n   <access> identifier.\n"
