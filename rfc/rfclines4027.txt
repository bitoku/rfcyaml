Abstract This document registers the media types application/dns and text/dns in accordance with RFC 2048.
The application/dns media type is used to identify data on the detached Domain Name System (DNS) format described in RFC 2540.
The text/dns media type is used to identify master files as described in RFC 1035.
Introduction Domain Name System (DNS)
[1] information is traditionally stored in text files, so called master files or zone files.
The format is described in section 5 of RFC 1035 [2].
DNS data can also be stored in a "detached" format, intended for archiving purposes, described in RFC 2540 [4].
This document registers MIME media types for the two data formats, with the registration procedures described in RFC 2048 [3].
MIME Type Registration of application/
Subject: Registration of MIME media type application/dns MIME media type name: application MIME subtype name:
Encoding considerations: The data format is binary, and data must be transfered unmodified.
Using encodings intended for textual parts is not recommended.
This media type identifies content as being detached DNS information, as documented in RFC 2540 [4].
This data may be security relevant as per RFC 2538 [7] or may be secured information as per RFC 2535 [6].
Securing the content further may be done with standard techniques, such as OpenPGP [5] or CMS [9], but this is outside of the scope here.
Further security assessments are not available at this point.
Interoperability considerations: The encoding of detached DNS information is, unlike textual master files, well defined.
No further interoperability considerations are known.
The format of data that could be tagged with this media type is documented in RFC 2540 [4].
Applications that use this media type: DNS related software, including software storing and using certificates stored in DNS.
Additional information: Magic number(s): None.

MIME Type Registration of text/
Subject: Registration of MIME media type text/dns MIME media type name:
Encoding considerations: The data is textual and should be transfered in a line oriented mode.
Text literals may contain CRLF within the text.
Binary transport is possible between systems that use the same end of line conventions.
Master files are in general ASCII, but non ASCII octet values may occur and are treated as opaque values by DNS software (compare RFC 1035, section 5).
The master file format permits encoding arbitrary octet values by using the "\DDD" encoding.
The use of "\DDD" encoding can be more reliable than transporting non ASCII through MIME transports, if data passes through a gateway that re encodes the character data.
This media type identifies content as being DNS information in "master file" format, as documented in RFC 1035 [2].
The DNS data may be security relevant as per to RFC 2538 [7], or may be secured information as per to RFC 2535 [6].
Securing the content further may be done with standard techniques, such as OpenPGP [5] or CMS [9], but this is outside of the scope here.
Further security assessments are not available at this point.
Interoperability considerations: There are interoperability concerns with master files, due to the widespread use of vendor specific extensions.
Non ASCII comments within master files may have been encoded in locally chosen character sets, which may be difficult to transport interoperably.
Non ASCII data in general can become corrupted by re encoding gateways.
To achieve interoperability, one can use the master file format described in the specification and the "\DDD" encoding for non ASCII octets.
Further interoperability issues with unrecognized RR types exist, which may be handled as discussed in section 5 of RFC 3597 [8].
The format of data that could be tagged with this MIME type is documented in RFC 1035 [2].
Applications that use this media type: DNS related software, including software storing and using certificates stored in DNS.

Security Considerations Security considerations are discussed in the security considerations clauses of the MIME registrations in sections 2 and 3.
The IANA has registered the MIME media types application/dns and text/dns by using the registration templates in sections 2 and 3, as per the procedure described in RFC 2048 [3].
