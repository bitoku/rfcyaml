- title: Introduction
  contents:
  - "Introduction\n   The following is the description of a TELNET option designed\
    \ to\n   facilitate double login avoidance.  It is intended primarily for TAC\n\
    \   connections to target hosts on behalf of TAC users, but it can be\n   used\
    \ between any two consenting hosts.  For example, all hosts at one\n   site (e.g.,\
    \ BBN) can use this option to avoid double login when\n   TELNETing to one another.\n"

    \ user) refuses to authenticate the user on\n      whose behalf the connection\
    \ is initiated.\n   IAC DO TUID\n      The sender (the TELNET server) proposes\
    \ that the recipient (the\n      TELNET user) authenticate the user and send the\
    \ identifing UUID;\n      or, the sender (the TELNET server) agrees to accept\
    \ the\n      recipient's (the TELNET user's) authentication of the user\n    \
    \  identified by his UUID.\n"

- title: 4. Motivation for the Option
  contents:
  - "4. Motivation for the Option\n   Under TACACS (the TAC Access Control System)\
    \ a user must be\n   authenticated (give a correct name/password pair) to a TAC\
    \ before he\n   can connect to a host via the TAC.  To avoid a second authentication\n\
    \   by the target host, the TAC can pass along the user's proven identity\n  \
    \ (his UUID) to the that host.  Hosts may accept the TAC's\n   authentication\
    \ of the user or not, at their option.\n   The same option can be used between\
    \ any pair of cooperating hosts for\n   the purpose of double login avoidance.\n"
- title: 5. Description for the Option
  contents:
  - "5. Description for the Option\n   At the time that a host establishes a TELNET\
    \ connection for a user to\n   another host, if the latter supports the TUID option\
    \ and wants to\n   receive the user's UUID, it sends an IAC DO TUID to the the\
    \ user's\n   host.  If the user's host supports the TUID option and wants to\n\
    \   authenticate the user by sending the user's UUID, it responds IAC\n   WILL\
    \ TUID; otherwise it responds with IAC WON'T TUID.  If both the\n   user and server\
    \ TELNETs agree, the user TELNET will then send the\n   UUID to the server TELNET\
    \ by sub-negotiation.\n"

- title: 6. Examples
  contents:
  - "6. Examples\n   There are two possible negotiations that result in the double\
    \ login\n   avoidance authentication of a user.  Both the server and the user\n\
    \   TELNET support the TUID option.\n      S = Server, U = User\n      Case 1:\n\
    \         S-> IAC DO TUID\n         U-> IAC WILL TUID\n         U-> IAC SB TUID\
    \ <32-bit UUID> IAC SE\n      Case 2:\n         U-> IAC WILL TUID\n         S->\
    \ IAC DO TUID\n         U-> IAC SB TUID <32-bit UUID> IAC SE\n   There are also\
    \ two possible negoitiations that do not result in the\n   authentication of a\
    \ user.  In the first example the server supports\n   TUID and the user TELNET\
    \ doesn't.  In the second example the user\n   TELNET supports TUID but the server\
    \ TELNET doesn't.\n      S = Server, U = User\n      Case 3:\n         S-> IAC\
    \ DO TUID\n         U-> IAC WONT TUID\n      Case 4:\n         U-> IAC WILL TUID\n\
    \         S-> IAC DONT TUID\n   The TUID is transmitted with the subnegotiation\
    \ command.  For\n   example, if the UUID had the value 1 the following string\
    \ of octets\n   would be transmitted:\n      IAC SB TUID 0 0 0 1 IAC SE\n   If\
    \ the UUID had the value 255 the following string of octets would be\n   transmitted:\n\
    \      IAC SB TUID 0 0 0 IAC IAC IAC SE\n"
