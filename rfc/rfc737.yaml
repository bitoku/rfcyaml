  - "                          FTP Extension: XSEN\nThis note describes an extension\
    \ to the File Transfer Protocol which\nprovides for \"sending\" a message to a\
    \ logged-in user, as well as\nvariants for mailing it normally whether the user\
    \ is logged in or not.\nSeveral systems have a SEND command or program which sends\
    \ a message\ndirectly to a user's terminal.   On the SAIL (SU-AI) and ITS\n(MIT-(AI/ML/MC/DMS))\
    \ systems the concept has been broadened to allow\nSEND'ing to users on other\
    \ network sites; to support this, three new FTP\ncommands were added which have\
    \ a syntax identical to the existing MAIL\ncommand.  For reference, the latter\
    \ is:\n   MAIL <SP> <recipient name> <CRLF>\n      If accepted, returns 350 reply\
    \ and considers all succeeding lines\n      to be the message text, terminated\
    \ by a line containing only a\n      period, upon which a 256 completion reply\
    \ is returned.  Various\n      errors are possible.\nThe new commands, with their\
    \ special replies, are:\n   XSEN -- Send to terminal.\n      Returns 453 failure\
    \ reply if the addressee is refusing or not\n      logged in.\n   XSEM -- Send,\
    \ Mail if can't.\n      Returns 009 notification reply if message cannot be SENT.\n\
    \   XMAS -- Mail And Send. (couldn't resist this one)\n      No special replies.\n\
    Note that for XSEM and XMAS, it is the mailing which determines success,\nnot\
    \ the SENDing, although XSEM as implemented uses a 009 reply (in\naddition to\
    \ the normal success/failure code) to indicate that because\nthe SEND failed,\
    \ an attempt is being made to mail the message instead.\nThere are no corresponding\
    \ variants for MLFL, since messages transmitted\nin this way are generally short,\
    \ and neither I nor Brian Harvey\n(implementing respectively the ITS and SAIL\
    \ servers) wanted to bother.\n"
