  - "1.  Introduction\n   RFC 6973 [RFC6973] discusses privacy considerations for\
    \ Internet\n   protocols, and Section 5.2 of that document covers a number of\n\
    \   privacy-specific threats.  In the context of IPv6 addresses, Section\n   3\
    \ of [RFC7721] provides further elaboration on the applicability of\n   the privacy\
    \ threats.\n   When interface identifiers (IIDs) are generated without sufficient\n\
    \   entropy compared to the link lifetime, devices and users can become\n   vulnerable\
    \ to the various threats discussed there, including:\n   o  Correlation of activities\
    \ over time, if the same identifier is\n      used for traffic over period of\
    \ time\n   o  Location tracking, if the same interface identifier is used with\n\
    \      different prefixes as a device moves between different networks\n   o \
    \ Device-specific vulnerability exploitation, if the identifier\n      helps identify\
    \ a vendor or version or protocol and hence suggests\n      what types of attacks\
    \ to try\n   o  Address scanning, which enables all of the above attacks by\n\
    \      off-link attackers.  (On some Non-Broadcast Multi-Access (NBMA)\n     \
    \ links where all nodes aren't already privy to all on-link\n      addresses,\
    \ address scans might also be done by on-link attackers;\n      however, in most\
    \ cases, address scans are not an interesting\n      threat from on-link attackers\
    \ and thus address scans generally\n      apply only to routable addresses.)\n\
    \   For example, for links that may last for years, \"enough\" bits of\n   entropy\
    \ means at least 46 or so bits (see Section 2 for why) in a\n   routable address;\
    \ ideally all 64 bits of the IID should be used,\n   although historically some\
    \ bits have been excluded for reasons\n   discussed in [RFC7421].  Link-local\
    \ addresses can also be susceptible\n   to the same privacy threats from off-link\
    \ attackers, since experience\n   shows they are often leaked by upper-layer protocols\
    \ such as SMTP,\n   SIP, or DNS.\n   For these reasons, [RFC8064] recommends using\
    \ an address generation\n   scheme in [RFC7217], rather than addresses generated\
    \ from a fixed\n   link-layer address.\n   Furthermore, to mitigate the threat\
    \ of correlation of activities over\n   time on long-lived links, [RFC4941] specifies\
    \ the notion of a\n   \"temporary\" address to be used for transport sessions\
    \ (typically\n   locally initiated outbound traffic to the Internet) that should\
    \ not\n   be linkable to a more permanent identifier such as a DNS name, user\n\
    \   name, or fixed link-layer address.  Indeed, the default address\n   selection\
    \ rules [RFC6724] now prefer temporary addresses by default\n   for outgoing connections.\
    \  If a device needs to simultaneously\n   support unlinkable traffic as well\
    \ as traffic that is linkable to\n   such a stable identifier, supporting simultaneous\
    \ use of multiple\n   addresses per device is necessary.\n"
- title: 2.  Amount of Entropy Needed in Global Addresses
  contents:
  - "2.  Amount of Entropy Needed in Global Addresses\n   In terms of privacy threats\
    \ discussed in [RFC7721], the one with the\n   need for the most entropy is address\
    \ scans of routable addresses.  To\n   mitigate address scans, one needs enough\
    \ entropy to make the\n   probability of a successful address probe be negligible.\
    \  Typically,\n   this is measured in the length of time it would take to have\
    \ a 50%\n   probability of getting at least one hit.  Address scans often rely\
    \ on\n   sending a packet such as a TCP SYN or ICMP Echo Request, then\n   determining\
    \ whether the reply is a) an ICMP unreachable error (if no\n   host exists with\
    \ that address), b) a TCP response or ICMP Echo Reply\n   (if a host exists),\
    \ or c) none of those, in which case nothing is\n   known for certain.\n   Many\
    \ privacy-sensitive devices support a \"stealth mode\" as discussed\n   in Section\
    \ 5 of [RFC7288] or are behind a network firewall that will\n   drop unsolicited\
    \ inbound traffic (e.g., TCP SYNs, ICMP Echo Requests,\n   etc.) and thus no TCP\
    \ RST or ICMP Echo Reply will be sent.  In such\n   cases, and when the device\
    \ does not listen on a well-known TCP or UDP\n   port known to the scanner, the\
    \ effectiveness of an address scan is\n   limited by the ability to get ICMP unreachable\
    \ errors, since the\n   attacker can only infer the presence of a host based on\
    \ the absence\n   of an ICMP unreachable error.\n   Generation of ICMP unreachable\
    \ errors is typically rate limited to 2\n   per second (the default in routers\
    \ such as Cisco routers running IOS\n   12.0 or later).  Such a rate results in\
    \ taking about a year to\n   completely scan 26 bits of space.\n   The actual\
    \ math is as follows.  Let 2^N be the number of devices on\n   the subnet.  Let\
    \ 2^M be the size of the space to scan (i.e., M bits\n   of entropy).  Let S be\
    \ the number of scan attempts.  The formula for\n   a 50% chance of getting at\
    \ least one hit in S attempts is:\n   P(at least one success) = 1 - (1 - 2^N/2^M)^S\
    \ = 1/2.\n   Assuming 2^M >> S, this simplifies to:\n   S * 2^N/2^M = 1/2, giving\
    \ S = 2^(M-N-1), or M = N + 1 + log_2(S).\n   Using a scan rate of 2 per second,\
    \ this results in the following rule\n   of thumb:\n      Bits of entropy needed\
    \ =\n         log_2(# devices per link) + log_2(seconds of link lifetime) + 2\n\
    \   For example, for a network with at most 2^16 devices on the same\n   long-lived\
    \ link, where the average lifetime of a link is 8 years\n   (2^28 seconds) or\
    \ less, this results in a need for at least 46 bits\n   of entropy (16+28+2) so\
    \ that an address scan would need to be\n   sustained for longer than the lifetime\
    \ of the link to have a 50%\n   chance of getting a hit.\n   Although 46 bits\
    \ of entropy may be enough to provide privacy in such\n   cases, 59 or more bits\
    \ of entropy would be needed if addresses are\n   used to provide security against\
    \ attacks such as spoofing, as CGAs\n   [RFC3972] and HBAs [RFC5535] do, since\
    \ attacks are not limited by\n   ICMP rate limiting but by the processing power\
    \ of the attacker.  See\n   those RFCs for more discussion.\n   If, on the other\
    \ hand, the devices being scanned for respond to\n   unsolicited inbound packets,\
    \ then the address scan is not limited by\n   the ICMP unreachable rate limit\
    \ in routers, since an adversary can\n   determine the presence of a host without\
    \ them.  In such cases, more\n   bits of entropy would be needed to provide the\
    \ same level of\n   protection.\n"

    \ \"Short Addresses\", or both, as link-layer addresses.  We\n   discuss each\
    \ in turn.\n"
- title: 3.1.  IEEE-Identifier-Based Addresses
  contents:
  - "3.1.  IEEE-Identifier-Based Addresses\n   Some technologies allow the use of\
    \ IEEE EUI-48 or EUI-64 identifiers\n   or allow the use of an arbitrary 64-bit\
    \ identifier.  Using such an\n   identifier to construct IPv6 addresses makes\
    \ it easy to use the\n   normal LOWPAN_IPHC encoding [RFC6282] with stateless\
    \ compression,\n   which allows such IPv6 addresses to be fully elided in common\
    \ cases.\n   Global addresses with interface identifiers formed from IEEE\n  \
    \ identifiers can have insufficient entropy to mitigate address scans\n   unless\
    \ the IEEE identifier itself has sufficient entropy and enough\n   bits of entropy\
    \ are carried over into the IPv6 address to\n   sufficiently mitigate the threats.\
    \  Privacy threats other than\n   \"Correlation over time\" can be mitigated using\
    \ per-network randomized\n   link-layer addresses with enough entropy compared\
    \ to the link\n   lifetime.  A number of such proposals can be found at\n   <https://mentor.ieee.org/privecsg/documents>,\
    \ and Section 10.8 of\n   [BTCorev4.1] specifies one for Bluetooth.  Using routable\
    \ IPv6\n   addresses derived from such link-layer addresses would be roughly\n\
    \   equivalent to those specified in [RFC7217].\n   Correlation over time (for\
    \ all addresses, not just routable\n   addresses) can be mitigated if the link-layer\
    \ address itself changes\n   often enough, such as each time the link is established,\
    \ if the link\n   lifetime is short.  For further discussion, see [RANDOM-ADDR].\n\
    \   Another potential concern is that of efficiency, such as avoiding\n   Duplicate\
    \ Address Detection (DAD) altogether when IPv6 addresses are\n   based on IEEE\
    \ identifiers.  Appendix A of [RFC4429] provides an\n   analysis of address-collision\
    \ probability based on the number of bits\n   of entropy.  A simple web search\
    \ on \"duplicate MAC addresses\" will\n   show that collisions do happen with\
    \ MAC addresses; thus, based on the\n   analysis in [RFC4429], using sufficient\
    \ bits of entropy in random\n   addresses can provide greater protection against\
    \ collision than using\n   MAC addresses.\n"
- title: 3.2.  Short Addresses
  contents:
  - "3.2.  Short Addresses\n   A routable IPv6 address with an interface identifier\
    \ formed from the\n   combination of a \"Short Address\" and a set of well-known\
    \ constant\n   bits (such as padding with 0's) lacks sufficient entropy to mitigate\n\
    \   address scanning unless the link lifetime is extremely short.\n   Furthermore,\
    \ an adversary could also use statistical methods to\n   determine the size of\
    \ the L2 address space and thereby make some\n   inference regarding the underlying\
    \ technology on a given link, and\n   target further attacks accordingly.\n  \
    \ When Short Addresses are desired on links that are not guaranteed to\n   have\
    \ a short enough lifetime, the mechanism for constructing an IPv6\n   interface\
    \ identifier from a Short Address could be designed to\n   sufficiently mitigate\
    \ the problem.  For example, if all nodes on a\n   given L2 network have a shared\
    \ secret (such as the key needed to get\n   on the layer-2 network), the 64-bit\
    \ IID might be generated using a\n   one-way hash that includes (at least) the\
    \ shared secret together with\n   the Short Address.  The use of such a hash would\
    \ result in the IIDs\n   being spread out among the full range of IID address\
    \ space, thus\n   mitigating address scans while still allowing full stateless\n\
    \   compression/elision.\n   For long-lived links, \"temporary\" addresses might\
    \ even be generated\n   in the same way by (for example) also including in the\
    \ hash the\n   Version Number from the Authoritative Border Router Option (Section\n\
    \   4.3 of [RFC6775]), if any.  This would allow changing temporary\n   addresses\
    \ whenever the Version Number is changed, even if the set of\n   prefix or context\
    \ information is unchanged.\n   In summary, any specification using Short Addresses\
    \ should carefully\n   construct an IID generation mechanism so as to provide\
    \ sufficient\n   entropy compared to the link lifetime.\n"
- title: 4.  Recommendations
  contents:
  - "4.  Recommendations\n   The following are recommended for adaptation-layer specifications:\n\
    \   o  Security (privacy) sections should say how address scans are\n      mitigated.\
    \  An address scan might be mitigated by having a link\n      always be short-lived,\
    \ by having a large number of bits of entropy\n      in routable addresses, or\
    \ by some combination thereof.  Thus, a\n      specification should explain what\
    \ the maximum lifetime of a link\n      is in practice and show how the number\
    \ of bits of entropy is\n      sufficient given that lifetime.\n   o  Technologies\
    \ should define a way to include sufficient bits of\n      entropy in the IPv6\
    \ interface identifier, based on the maximum\n      link lifetime.  Specifying\
    \ that randomized link-layer addresses\n      can be used is one easy way to do\
    \ so, for technologies that\n      support such identifiers.\n   o  Specifications\
    \ should not simply construct an IPv6 interface\n      identifier by padding a\
    \ Short Address with a set of other well-\n      known constant bits, unless the\
    \ link lifetime is guaranteed to be\n      extremely short or the Short Address\
    \ is allocated by the network\n      (rather than being constant in the node).\
    \  This also applies to\n      link-local addresses if the same Short Address\
    \ is used independent\n      of network and is unique enough to allow location\
    \ tracking.\n   o  Specifications should make sure that an IPv6 address can change\n\
    \      over long periods of time.  For example, the interface identifier\n   \
    \   might change each time a device connects to the network (if\n      connections\
    \ are short) or might change each day (if connections\n      can be long).  This\
    \ is necessary to mitigate correlation over\n      time.\n   o  If a device can\
    \ roam between networks and more than a few bits of\n      entropy exist in the\
    \ IPv6 interface identifier, then make sure\n      that the interface identifier\
    \ can vary per network as the device\n      roams.  This is necessary to mitigate\
    \ location tracking.\n"
