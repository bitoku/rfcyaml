  - "1.  Introduction\n   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information\
    \ Base (MIB)\n   for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.\n\
    \   In particular, it describes the Remote Authentication Dial-In User\n   Service\
    \ (RADIUS) [RFC2865] Dynamic Authorization Client (DAC)\n   functions that support\
    \ the dynamic authorization extensions as\n   defined in RFC 3576.\n   It is becoming\
    \ increasingly important to support Dynamic\n   Authorization extensions on the\
    \ network access server (NAS) devices\n   to handle the Disconnect and Change-of-Authorization\
    \ (CoA) messages,\n   as described in [RFC3576].  As a result, the effective management\
    \ of\n   RADIUS Dynamic Authorization entities is of considerable importance.\n\
    \   This RADIUS Dynamic Authorization Client MIB complements the managed\n   objects\
    \ used for managing RADIUS authentication and accounting\n   servers, as described\
    \ in [RFC4669] and [RFC4671], respectively.\n"

  - "1.2.  Terminology\n   Dynamic Authorization Server (DAS)\n   The component that\
    \ resides on the NAS that processes the Disconnect\n   and Change-of-Authorization\
    \ (CoA) Request packets [RFC3576] sent by\n   the Dynamic Authorization Client.\n\
    \   Dynamic Authorization Client (DAC)\n   The component that sends Disconnect\
    \ and CoA-Request packets to the\n   Dynamic Authorization Server.  Although this\
    \ component often resides\n   on the RADIUS server, it is also possible for this\
    \ component to be\n   located on a separate host, such as a Rating Engine.\n \
    \  Dynamic Authorization Server Port\n   The UDP port on which the Dynamic Authorization\
    \ Server listens for\n   the Disconnect and CoA requests sent by the Dynamic Authorization\n\
    \   Client.\n"
- title: 2.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework
  contents:
  - "2.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework\n   For a detailed overview of\
    \ the documents that describe the current\n   Internet-Standard Management Framework,\
    \ please refer to section 7 of\n   [RFC3410].\n   Managed objects are accessed\
    \ via a virtual information store, termed\n   the Management Information Base\
    \ or MIB.  MIB objects are generally\n   accessed through the Simple Network Management\
    \ Protocol (SNMP).\n   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined\
    \ in the\n   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a\
    \ MIB\n   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,\n\
    \   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579], and STD 58, RFC 2580\n   [RFC2580].\n"
- title: 3.  Overview
  contents:
  - "3.  Overview\n   \"Dynamic Authorization Extensions to RADIUS\" [RFC3576] defines\
    \ the\n   operation of Disconnect-Request, Disconnect-ACK, Disconnect-NAK,\n \
    \  CoA-Request, CoA-ACK, and CoA-NAK packets.  [RFC4673] defines the\n   Dynamic\
    \ Authorization Server MIB and the relationship with other MIB\n   modules.  This\
    \ MIB module for the Dynamic Authorization Client\n   contains the following:\n\
    \   1.  Two scalar objects\n   2.  One Dynamic Authorization Server table.  This\
    \ table contains one\n       row for each DAS with which the DAC shares a secret.\n"

  - "5.  Security Considerations\n   There are no management objects defined in this\
    \ MIB module that have\n   a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.\
    \  So, if this\n   MIB module is implemented correctly, then there is no risk\
    \ that an\n   intruder can alter or create any management objects of this MIB\n\
    \   module via direct SNMP SET operations.\n   Some of the readable objects in\
    \ this MIB module (i.e., objects with a\n   MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible)\
    \ may be considered sensitive or\n   vulnerable in some network environments.\
    \  It is thus important to\n   control even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these\
    \ objects and possibly\n   to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending\
    \ them over\n   the network via SNMP.  These are the tables and objects and their\n\
    \   sensitivity/vulnerability:\n   radiusDynAuthServerAddress and radiusDynAuthServerAddressType\n\
    \      These can be used to determine the address of the DAS with which\n    \
    \  the DAC is communicating.  This information could be useful in\n      mounting\
    \ an attack on the DAS.\n   radiusDynAuthServerID\n      This can be used to determine\
    \ the Identifier of the DAS.  This\n      information could be useful in impersonating\
    \ the DAS.\n   radiusDynAuthServerClientPortNumber\n      This can be used to\
    \ determine the destination port number to which\n      the DAC is sending.  This\
    \ information could be useful in mounting\n      an attack on the DAS.\n   SNMP\
    \ versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.\n   Even if the\
    \ network itself is secure (for example by using IPsec),\n   even then, there\
    \ is no control as to who on the secure network is\n   allowed to access and GET/SET\
    \ (read/change/create/delete) the objects\n   in this MIB module.\n   It is RECOMMENDED\
    \ that implementers consider the security features as\n   provided by the SNMPv3\
    \ framework (see [RFC3410], section 8),\n   including full support for the SNMPv3\
    \ cryptographic mechanisms (for\n   authentication and privacy).\n   Further,\
    \ deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT\n   RECOMMENDED.  Instead,\
    \ it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to\n   enable cryptographic security.\
    \  It is then a customer/operator\n   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity\
    \ giving access to an\n   instance of this MIB module is properly configured to\
    \ give access to\n   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate\n\
    \   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.\n"
