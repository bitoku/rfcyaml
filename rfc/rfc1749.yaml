  - "1.  Introduction\n   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information\
    \ Base (MIB)\n   for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.\n\
    \   In particular, it describes managed objects used by IEEE 802.5 end-\n   stations\
    \ for managing source routes on a Token Ring network where\n   IEEE source-routing\
    \ is in use.  IEEE source-routing is described in\n   802.5 Token Ring Access\
    \ Method and Physical Layer Specifications [8]\n   and related ISO publications\
    \ [9, 10, 11].\n   This memo is an incremental update to RFC 1748 [6].  It is\
    \ documented\n   separately from the RFC 1748 solely due to the latter's maturity\n\
    \   within the Internet standardization process.\n"
- title: 2.  The SNMPv2 Network Management Framework
  contents:
  - "2.  The SNMPv2 Network Management Framework\n   The SNMPv2 Network Management\
    \ Framework consists of four major\n   components.  They are:\n      o    RFC\
    \ 1442 [1] which defines the SMI, the mechanisms used for\n           describing\
    \ and naming objects for the purpose of management.\n      o    STD 17, RFC 1213\
    \ [2] defines MIB-II, the core set of managed\n           objects for the Internet\
    \ suite of protocols.\n      o    RFC 1445 [3] which defines the administrative\
    \ and other\n           architectural aspects of the framework.\n      o    RFC\
    \ 1448 [4] which defines the protocol used for network\n           access to managed\
    \ objects.\n   The Framework permits new objects to be defined for the purpose\
    \ of\n   experimentation and evaluation.\n"
- title: 2.1.  Object Definitions
  contents:
  - "2.1.  Object Definitions\n   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information\
    \ store, termed\n   the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB\
    \ are\n   defined using the subset of Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1)\n \
    \  defined in the SMI.  In particular, each object type is named by an\n   OBJECT\
    \ IDENTIFIER, an administratively assigned name.  The object\n   type together\
    \ with an object instance serves to uniquely identify a\n   specific instantiation\
    \ of the object.  For human convenience, we\n   often use a textual string, termed\
    \ the descriptor, to refer to the\n   object type.\n"
- title: 3.  Overview
  contents:
  - "3.  Overview\n   This memo defines a single table: the 802.5 Station Source Routing\n\
    \   Table, which contains the source routes known by a end-station on an\n   IEEE\
    \ 802.5 Token Ring network in which IEEE source-routing is in use.\n"
- title: 3.1.  Source Routing
  contents:
  - "3.1.  Source Routing\n   Source routing extends the 802.5 protocol [8] by assigning\
    \ a unique\n   ring number to each ring within the extended LAN, and a bridge\
    \ number\n   to each source routing bridge's connection to a ring.  A Routing\n\
    \   Information Field (RIF) must be included in frames which need to\n   traverse\
    \ multiple rings.  The format of the RIF is:\n              octets octets octets\
    \         octets\n               1&2    3&4    5&6            17&18\n        \

    \   solely due to the maturity of the definitions contained within RFC\n   1748.\n"
- title: 3.3.  Relationship to RFC 1525
  contents:
  - "3.3.  Relationship to RFC 1525\n   RFC 1525 [7] defines the MIB objects specific\

    \ the MIB objects\n   specific to source-routing for source-routing end-stations.\n"
- title: 3.4.  Static Source Routes
  contents:
  - "3.4.  Static Source Routes\n   It is unclear how many, if any, existing systems\
    \ allow the creation\n   or deletion of \"static\" 802.5 source routes by network\
    \ management.\n   However, SNMPv2 SMI defines that the MAX-ACCESS clause as specifying\n\
    \   the maximal level of access which makes \"protocol sense\".  Thus, this\n\
    \   memo provides support for static source routes through the\n   dot5SrRouteStatus\
    \ object, but the conformance statements allow for\n   stations which do not support\
    \ static source routes, by requiring that\n   compliant agents only need provide\
    \ read-access to dot5SrRouteStatus.\n"
- title: 3.5.  Destinations on the Local Ring
  contents:
  - "3.5.  Destinations on the Local Ring\n   Entries should be included in the dot5SrRouteTable\
    \ for destination\n   MAC addresses which are on the same ring as the instrumented\
    \ 802.5\n   interface.  For such entries, dot5SrRouteDescr has the value of the\n\
    \   zero-length string, and dot5SrRouteControl has the corresponding\n   value.\n"
