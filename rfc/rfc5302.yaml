  - "1.  Introduction\n   This document describes extensions to the Intermediate System
    to\n   Intermediate System (IS-IS) protocol to support optimal routing\n   within
    a two-level domain.  The IS-IS protocol is specified in\n   [ISO-10589], with
    extensions for supporting IPv4 (Internet Protocol)\n   specified in [RFC1195].\n
    \  This document replaces [RFC2966], which was an Informational\n   document.
    \ This document is on the standards track.  No other\n   intentional substantive
    changes have been made.\n   This document extends the semantics presented in RFC
    1195 so that a\n   routing domain running with both level 1 and level 2 Intermediate\n
    \  Systems (IS) (routers) can distribute IP prefixes between level 1 and\n   level
    2, and vice versa.  This distribution requires certain\n   restrictions to ensure
    that persistent forwarding loops do not form.\n   The goal of this domain-wide
    prefix distribution is to increase the\n   granularity of the routing information
    within the domain.\n   An IS-IS routing domain (a.k.a. an autonomous system running
    IS-IS)\n   can be partitioned into multiple level 1 (L1) areas, and a level 2\n
    \  (L2) connected subset of the topology that interconnects all of the\n   L1
    areas.  Within each L1 area, all routers exchange link state\n   information.
    \ L2 routers also exchange L2 link state information to\n   compute routes between
    areas.\n   RFC 1195 defines the Type, Length, and Value (TLV) tuples that are\n
    \  used to transport IPv4 routing information in IS-IS.  RFC 1195 also\n   specifies
    the semantics and procedures for interactions between\n   levels.  Specifically,
    routers in an L1 area will exchange\n   information within the L1 area.  For IP
    destinations not found in the\n   prefixes in the L1 database, the L1 router should
    forward packets to\n   the nearest router that is in both L1 and L2 (i.e., an
    L1L2 router)\n   with the \"attached bit\" set in its L1 Link State Protocol Data
    Unit\n   (LSP).\n   Also per RFC 1195, an L1L2 router should be manually configured
    with\n   a set of prefixes that summarizes the IP prefixes reachable in that\n
    \  L1 area.  These summaries are injected into L2.  RFC 1195 specifies\n   no
    further interactions between L1 and L2 for IPv4 prefixes.\n"

    - "1.1.  Motivations for Domain-Wide Prefix Distribution\n   The mechanisms specified
      in RFC 1195 are appropriate in many\n   situations and lead to excellent scalability
      properties.  However, in\n   certain circumstances, the domain administrator
      may wish to sacrifice\n   some amount of scalability and distribute more specific
      information\n   than is described by RFC 1195.  This section discusses the various\n
      \  reasons why the domain administrator may wish to make such a\n   tradeoff.\n
      \  One major reason for distributing more prefix information is to\n   improve
      the quality of the resulting routes.  A well-known property\n   of prefix summarization
      or any abstraction mechanism is that it\n   necessarily results in a loss of
      information.  This loss of\n   information in turn results in the computation
      of a route based upon\n   less information, which will frequently result in
      routes that are not\n   optimal.\n   A simple example can serve to demonstrate
      this adequately.  Suppose\n   that an L1 area has two L1L2 routers that both
      advertise a single\n   summary of all prefixes within the L1 area.  To reach
      a destination\n   inside the L1 area, any other L2 router is going to compute
      the\n   shortest path to one of the two L1L2 routers for that area.  Suppose,\n
      \  for example, that both of the L1L2 routers are equidistant from the\n   L2
      source and that the L2 source arbitrarily selects one L1L2 router.\n   This
      router may not be the optimal router when viewed from the L1\n   topology.  In
      fact, it may be the case that the path from the\n   selected L1L2 router to
      the destination router may traverse the L1L2\n   router that was not selected.
      \ If more detailed topological\n   information or more detailed metric information
      was available to the\n   L2 source router, it could make a more optimal route
      computation.\n   This situation is symmetric in that an L1 router has no information\n
      \  about prefixes in L2 or within a different L1 area.  In using the\n   nearest
      L1L2 router, that L1L2 is effectively injecting a default\n   route without
      metric information into the L1 area.  The route\n   computation that the L1
      router performs is similarly suboptimal.\n   Besides the optimality of the routes
      computed, there are two other\n   significant drivers for the domain-wide distribution
      of prefix\n   information.\n   When a router learns multiple possible paths
      to external destinations\n   via BGP, it will select only one of those routes
      to be installed in\n   the forwarding table.  One of the factors in the BGP
      route selection\n   is the IGP cost to the BGP next hop address.  Many ISP networks\n
      \  depend on this technique, which is known as \"shortest exit routing\".\n
      \  If a L1 router does not know the exact IGP metric to all BGP speakers\n   in
      other L1 areas, it cannot do effective shortest exit routing.\n   The third
      driver is the current practice of using the IGP (IS-IS)\n   metric as part of
      the BGP Multi-Exit Discriminator (MED).  The value\n   in the MED is advertised
      to other domains and is used to inform other\n   domains of the optimal entry
      point into the current domain.  Current\n   practice is to take the IS-IS metric
      and insert it as the MED value.\n   This tends to cause external traffic to
      enter the domain at the point\n   closest to the exit router.  Note that the
      receiving domain MAY,\n   based upon policy, choose to ignore the MED that is
      advertised.\n   However, current practice is to distribute the IGP metric in
      this way\n   in order to optimize routing wherever possible.  This is possible
      in\n   current networks that only are a single area, but becomes problematic\n
      \  if hierarchy is to be installed into the network.  This is again\n   because
      the loss of end-to-end metric information means that the MED\n   value will
      not reflect the true distance across the advertising\n   domain.  Full distribution
      of prefix information within the domain\n   would alleviate this problem, as
      it would allow accurate computation\n   of the IS-IS metric across the domain,
      resulting in an accurate value\n   presented in the MED.\n"
    title: 1.1.  Motivations for Domain-Wide Prefix Distribution
  - contents:
    - "1.2.  Scalability\n   The disadvantage to performing the domain-wide prefix
      distribution\n   described above is that it has an impact on the scalability
      of IS-IS.\n   Areas within IS-IS help scalability in that LSPs are contained
      within\n   a single area.  This limits the size of the link state database,\n
      \  which in turn limits the complexity of the shortest path computation.\n   Further,
      the summarization of the prefix information aids scalability\n   in that the
      abstraction of the prefix information removes the sheer\n   number of data items
      to be transported and the number of routes to be\n   computed.\n   It should
      be noted quite strongly that the distribution of prefixes\n   on a domain-wide
      basis impacts the scalability of IS-IS in the second\n   respect.  It will increase
      the number of prefixes throughout the\n   domain.  This will result in increased
      memory consumption,\n   transmission requirements, and computation requirements
      throughout\n   the domain.\n   It must also be noted that the domain-wide distribution
      of prefixes\n   has no effect whatsoever on the first aspect of scalability,
      namely\n   the existence of areas and the limitation of the distribution of
      the\n   link state database.\n   Thus, the net result is that the introduction
      of domain-wide prefix\n   distribution into a formerly flat, single area network
      is a clear\n   benefit to the scalability of that network.  However, it is a\n
      \  compromise and does not provide the maximum scalability available\n   with
      IS-IS.  Domains that choose to make use of this facility should\n   be aware
      of the tradeoff that they are making between scalability and\n   optimality,
      and provision and monitor their networks accordingly.\n   Normal provisioning
      guidelines that would apply to a fully\n   hierarchical deployment of IS-IS
      will not apply to this type of\n   configuration.\n"

  - "2.  Proposed Syntax and Semantics for L2->L1 Inter-Area Routes\n   This document
    defines the syntax of how to advertise level 2 routes\n   in level 1 LSPs.  The
    encoding is an extension of the encoding in RFC\n   1195.\n   To some extent,
    in IS-IS the level 2 backbone can be seen as a\n   separate area itself.  RFC
    1195 defines that L1L2 routers can\n   advertise IP routes that were learned via
    L1 routing into L2.  These\n   routes can be regarded as inter-area routes.  RFC
    1195 defines that\n   these L1->L2 inter-area routes must be advertised in L2
    LSPs in the\n   \"IP Internal Reachability Information\" TLV (TLV 128).  Intra-area
    L2\n   routes are also advertised in L2 LSPs in an \"IP Internal Reachability\n
    \  Information\" TLV.  Therefore, L1->L2 inter-area routes are\n   indistinguishable
    from L2 intra-area routes.\n   RFC 1195 does not define L2->L1 inter-area routes.
    \ A simple\n   extension would be to allow an L1L2 router to advertise routes\n
    \  learned via L2 routing in its L1 LSP.  However, to prevent routing-\n   loops,
    L1L2 routers MUST NOT advertise L2->L1 inter-area routes that\n   they learn via
    L1 routing back into L2.  Therefore, there must be a\n   way to distinguish L2->L1
    inter-area routes from L1 intra-area\n   routes.  [RFC5305] defines the \"up/down
    bit\" for this purpose in the\n   extended IP reachability TLV (TLV 135).  RFC
    1195 defines TLVs 128\n   and 130 to contain IP routes.  TLVs 128 and 130 have
    a Metric field\n   that consists of 4 Type of Service (TOS) metrics.  The first
    metric,\n   the so-called \"default metric\", has the high-order bit reserved
    (bit\n   8).  Routers must set this bit to zero on transmission, and ignore it\n
    \  on receipt.\n   This document redefines this high-order bit in the default
    Metric\n   field in TLVs 128 and 130 to be the up/down bit.  L1L2 routers MUST\n
    \  set this bit to one for prefixes that are derived from L2 routing and\n   are
    advertised into L1 LSPs.  The bit MUST be set to zero for all\n   other IP prefixes
    in L1 or L2 LSPs.  Prefixes with the up/down bit\n   set that are learned via
    L1 routing MUST NOT be advertised by L1L2\n   routers back into L2.\n"
  - contents:
    - "2.1.  Clarification of External Route-Type and External Metric-Type\n   RFC
      1195 defines two TLVs for carrying IP prefixes.  TLV 128 is\n   defined as \"IP
      Internal Reachability Information\", and should be used\n   to carry IP prefixes
      that are directly connected to IS-IS routers.\n   TLV 130 is defined as \"IP
      External Reachability Information\", and\n   should be used to carry routes
      learned from outside the IS-IS domain.\n   RFC 1195 documents TLV type 130 only
      for level 2 LSPs.\n   RFC 1195 also defines two types of metrics.  Metrics of
      the internal\n   metric-type should be used when the metric is comparable to
      metrics\n   used to weigh links inside the IS-IS domain.  Metrics of the external\n
      \  metric-type should be used if the metric of an IP prefix cannot be\n   directly
      compared to internal metrics.  The external metric-type can\n   only be used
      for external IP prefixes.  A direct result is that\n   metrics of the external
      metric-type should never be seen in TLV 128.\n   To prevent confusion, this
      document states again that when a router\n   computes IP routes, it MUST give
      the same preference to IP routes\n   advertised in an \"IP Internal Reachability
      Information\" TLV and IP\n   routes advertised in an \"IP External Reachability
      Information\" TLV.\n   RFC 1195 states this quite clearly in the note in paragraph
      3.10.2,\n   item 2c).  This document does not alter this rule of preference.\n
      \  NOTE:  Internal routes (routes to destinations announced in the \"IP\n      Internal
      Reachability Information\" field) and external routes\n      using internal
      metrics (routes to destinations announced in the\n      \"IP External Reachability
      Information\" field, with a metric of\n      type \"internal\") are treated
      identically for the purpose of the\n      order of preference of routes, and
      the Dijkstra calculation.\n   However, IP routes advertised in \"IP External
      Reachability\n   Information\" with the external metric-type MUST be given less\n
      \  preference than the same IP routes advertised with the internal\n   metric-type,
      regardless of the value of the metrics.\n   While IS-IS routers MUST NOT give
      different preference to IP prefixes\n   learned via \"IP Internal Reachability
      Information\" and \"IP External\n   Reachability Information\" when executing
      the Dijkstra calculation,\n   routers that implement multiple IGPs are free
      to use this distinction\n   between internal and external routes when comparing
      routes derived\n   from different IGPs for inclusion in their global Routing
      Information\n   Base (RIB).\n"
    title: 2.1.  Clarification of External Route-Type and External Metric-Type
  - contents:
    - "2.2.  Definition of External IP Prefixes in Level 1 LSPs\n   RFC 1195 does
      not define the \"IP External Reachability Information\"\n   TLV for L1 LSPs.
      \ However, there is no reason why an IS-IS\n   implementation could not allow
      for redistribution of external routes\n   into L1.  Some IS-IS implementations
      already allow network\n   administrators to do this.  This document loosens
      the restrictions in\n   RFC 1195 and allows for the inclusion of the \"IP External\n
      \  Reachability Information\" TLV in L1 LSPs.\n   RFC 1195 defines that IP routes
      learned via L1 routing must always be\n   advertised in L2 LSPs in an \"IP Internal
      Reachability Information\"\n   TLV.  Now that this document allows \"IP External
      Reachability\n   Information\" TLVs in L1 LSPs and allows for the advertisement
      of\n   routes learned via L2 routing into L1, the above rule needs an\n   extension.\n
      \  When an L1L2 router advertises an L1 route into L2, where that L1\n   route
      was learned via a prefix advertised in an \"IP External\n   Reachability Information\"
      TLV, that L1L2 router SHOULD advertise that\n   prefix in its L2 LSP within
      an \"IP External Reachability Information\"\n   TLV.  L1 routes learned via
      an \"IP Internal Reachability Information\"\n   TLV SHOULD still be advertised
      within an \"IP Internal Reachability\n   Information\" TLV.  These rules should
      also be applied when\n   advertising IP routes derived from L2 routing into
      L1.  Of course in\n   this case, the up/down bit MUST be set also.\n   RFC 1195
      defines that if a router sees the same external prefix\n   advertised by two
      or more routers with the same external metric, it\n   must select the route
      that is advertised by the router that is\n   closest to itself.  It should be
      noted that now that external routes\n   can be advertised from L1 into L2, and
      vice versa, the router that\n   advertises an external prefix in its LSP might
      not be the router that\n   originally injected this prefix into the IS-IS domain.
      \ Therefore, it\n   is less useful to advertise external routes with external
      metrics\n   into other levels.\n"

    - "3.2.  Order of Preference for all Types of IP Routes in IS-IS\n   Unfortunately,
      IS-IS cannot depend on metrics alone for route\n   selection.  Some types of
      routes must always be preferred over\n   others, regardless of the costs that
      were computed in the Dijkstra\n   calculation.  One of the reasons for this
      is that inter-area routes\n   can only be advertised with a maximum metric of
      63.  Another reason\n   is that this maximum value of 63 does not mean infinity
      (e.g., like a\n   hop count of 16 in RIP denotes unreachable).  Introducing
      a value for\n   infinity cost in IS-IS inter-area routes would introduce counting-\n
      \  to-infinity behavior via two or more L1L2 routers, which would have a\n   bad
      impact on network stability.\n   The order of preference of IP routes in IS-IS
      is based on a few\n   assumptions.\n   o  RFC 1195 defines that routes derived
      from L1 routing are preferred\n      over routes derived from L2 routing.\n
      \  o  The note in RFC 1195, paragraph 3.10.2, item 2c) defines that\n      internal
      routes with internal metric-type and external prefixes\n      with internal
      metric-type have the same preference.\n   o  RFC 1195 defines that external
      routes with internal metric-type\n      are preferred over external routes with
      external metric-type.\n   o  Routes derived from L2 routing are preferred over
      L2->L1 routes\n      derived from L1 routing.\n   Based on these assumptions,
      this document defines the following route\n   preferences.\n   1.  L1 intra-area
      routes with internal metric; L1 external routes\n       with internal metric\n
      \  2.  L2 intra-area routes with internal metric; L2 external routes\n       with
      internal metric; L1->L2 inter-area routes with internal\n       metric; L1->L2
      inter-area external routes with internal metric\n   3.  L2->L1 inter-area routes
      with internal metric; L2->L1 inter-area\n       external routes with internal
      metric\n   4.  L1 external routes with external metric\n   5.  L2 external routes

    - "3.3.  Additional Notes on What Prefixes to Accept or Advertise\n   Section
      3.1 enumerates all used IP route-types in IS-IS.  Besides\n   these defined
      route-types, the encoding used would allow for a few\n   more potential combinations.
      \ One of them is the combination of \"IP\n   Internal Reachability Information\"
      and external metric-type.  This\n   combination SHOULD NOT be used when building
      an LSP.  Upon receipt of\n   an IP prefix with this combination, routers MUST
      ignore this prefix.\n   Another issue would be the usage of the up/down bit
      in L2 LSPs.\n   Because IS-IS is currently defined with two levels of hierarchy,\n
      \  there should never be a need to set the up/down bit in L2 LSPs.\n   However,
      if IS-IS would ever be extended with more than two levels of\n   hierarchy,
      L2-only (or L1L2) routers will need to be able to accept\n   L2 IP routes with
      the up/down bit set.  Therefore, it is RECOMMENDED\n   that implementations
      ignore the up/down bit in L2 LSPs, and accept\n   the prefixes in L2 LSPs regardless
      of whether the up/down bit is set.\n   This will allow for simpler migration
      once more than two levels of\n   hierarchy are defined.\n   Another detail that
      implementors should be aware of is the fact that\n   L1L2 routers SHOULD only
      advertise in their L2 LSP those L1 routes\n   that they use for forwarding themselves.
      \ They SHOULD NOT\n   unconditionally advertise into L2 all prefixes from LSPs
      in the L1\n   database.\n   Not all prefixes need to be advertised up or down
      the hierarchy.\n   Implementations might allow for additional manual filtering
      or\n   summarization to further bring down the number of inter-area prefixes\n
      \  they advertise in their LSPs.  It is also RECOMMENDED that the\n   default
      configuration of L1L2 routers not advertise any L2 routes\n   into L1 (see also
      Section 4).\n"

  - "4.  Inter-Operability with Older Implementations\n   The solution in this document
    is not fully compatible with RFC 1195.\n   It is an extension to RFC 1195.  If
    routers do not use the new\n   functionality of external L1 routes or L2->L1 inter-area
    routes,\n   older implementations that strictly follow RFC 1195 will be\n   compatible
    with newer implementations that follow this document.\n   Implementations that
    do not accept the \"IP External Reachability\n   Information\" TLV in L1 LSPs
    will not be able to compute external L1\n   routes.  This could cause routing
    loops between L1-only routers that\n   do understand external L1 routes for a
    particular destination, and\n   L1-only routers that use the default route pointing
    to the closest\n   attached L1L2 router for that destination.\n   Implementations
    that follow RFC 1195 SHOULD ignore bit 8 in the\n   default Metric field when
    computing routes.  Therefore, even older\n   implementations that do not know
    of the up/down bit should be able to\n   accept the new L2->L1 inter-area routes.
    \ These older implementations\n   will install the new L2->L1 inter-area routes
    as L1 intra-area\n   routes, but that in itself does not cause routing loops among
    L1-only\n   routers.\n   However, it is vital that the up/down bit is recognized
    by L1L2\n   routers.  As has been stated before, L1L2 routers MUST NOT advertise\n
    \  L2->L1 inter-area routes back into L2.  Therefore, if L2 routes are\n   advertised
    down into an L1 area, it is required that all L1L2 routers\n   in that area run
    software that understands the new up/down bit.\n   Older implementations that
    follow RFC 1195 and do not understand the\n   new up/down bit will treat the L2->L1
    inter-area routes as L1 intra-\n   area routes, and they will advertise these
    routes back into L2.  This\n   can cause routing loops, sub-optimal routing, or
    extra routing\n   instability.  For this reason, it is RECOMMENDED that implementations\n
    \  by default not advertise any L2 routes into L1.  Implementations\n   SHOULD
    force the network administrator to manually configure L1L2\n   routers to advertise
    any L2 routes into L1.\n"
  title: 4.  Inter-Operability with Older Implementations
- contents:
  - "5.  Comparisons with Other Proposals\n   In [RFC5305], a new TLV is defined to
    transport IP prefix\n   information.  This TLV format also defines an up/down
    bit to allow\n   for L2->L1 inter-area routes.  RFC 5305 also defines a new TLV
    to\n   describe links.  Both TLVs have wider metric space and have the\n   possibility
    to define sub-TLVs to advertise extra information\n   belonging to the link or
    prefix.  The wider metric space in IP prefix\n   TLVs allows for more granular
    metric information about inter-area\n   path costs.  To make full use of the wider
    metric space, network\n   administrators must deploy both new TLVs at the same
    time.\n   Deployment of RFC 5305 requires an upgrade of all routers in the\n   network
    and a transition to the new TLVs.  Such a network-wide\n   upgrade and transition
    might not be an easy task.  In this case, the\n   solution defined in this document,
    which requires only an upgrade of\n   L1L2 routers in selected areas, might be
    a good alternative to the\n   solution defined in 5305.\n"
