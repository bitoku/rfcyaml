A message may have at most one MESSAGE ID item.
All items with the same keyword must be grasped together.
Please note the following: (1)
The case (upper or lower) of keywords   specifically, 'FROM', 'DATE', 'SUBJECT', 'AT', <host>, <zone>, <vmonth> and <keyword>   is insignificant.
Although 'FROM', for example, appears in upper case in the formal syntax above, in the header of an actual message it may appear as 'FROM', 'from', or 'From', etc.
No attempt has been made to legislate the format of <user> except to exclude spaces from it.
The time has no internal punctuation.
MESSAGE HEADER FIELDS A. ORIGINATOR SPECIFICATION FIELDS FROM This field contains the identity of the person who wished this message to be sent.
This is expected to be the originator field which is specified by the user in the case that the message is being entered by one person for another.
The message creation process should default this field to be the user entering the message.
[The usage for FROM and SENDER differs from that of RFC 561.]
This field contains the identity of the person who sends the message.
This field is expected to be set by the message creation process automatically.
It is possible that some sites will not include this field in external communications.
This field contains a description of which originator fields have been authenticated, and by which operating systems.
This field should be created by message transmission and/or reception processes (FTP/Operating System level).
It is expected that current system will be able to authenticate only the SENDER field; however, later systems might have mechanisms to verify that the FROM actually authorized the SENDER to act on his/her behalf.
It is expected that, when the FROM is authenticated, the SENDER will no longer be necessary for external distribution.
B. REFERENCE SPECIFICATION FIELDS MESSAGE ID
This field contains a unique identifier to refer to this message.
The format for a message identifier is: [
Net Address]Text String CRLF Examples: [ISIB]7 DEC 74.14:23:45
The uniqueness of the message identifier is guaranteed by each net  address message processor making the text which follows unique for that net address.
This, specifically says net address and not site name.
This would allow BBN (for instance) to allocate unique identifiers over all four machines, which may be addressed as BBN within the message system, thus producing a more integrated service for their users.
The text following the net address is not defined here, as the problems associated with this specification are too great at this time.
However, the net address should allow automatic processes to determine if they can deal intelligently with the following text.
Several types of automatic processing by the local message reader are thus possible:  1) if the site uses a filing mechanism known to the reader, the reader can retrieve the message 2) if the site supports remote message access (protocol not currently defined),
the message id can be passed to the remote site and the message has been filed in the Datacomputer (using the entire message
id [including net address] as the handle), the reader can retrieve it from the Datacomputer.
IN REPLY TO The contents of this field identify previous correspondence which this message answers.
The contents of this field identify other correspondence which this message references.
This field contains keywords or phrases from the message, separated by commas.
C. RECEIVER SPECIFICATION FIELDS TO This field contains the identity of the primary receivers of the message.
This field contains the identity of the secondary receivers of the message.
BCC This field contains the identity of the tertiary receivers of the message.
This field should not be made available to the primary and secondary receivers, but it may be recorded to provide information for access control.
D. MESSAGE TYPE SPECIFICATION FIELDS PRECEDENCE
This field describes the importance and urgency of the message.
> means that the message should be delivered as soons as possible.
<ROUTINE> means that Priority processing is not necessary.
Plain text may also be included in this field.
This field describes the "legal" status of the message.
Examples: Official, Unofficial, Record, Off the Record, Junk Mail.
No automatic processing of this field is immediately expected.
Certain message creation processes might, for example, always insert:
Unofficial ARPANET Message SPECIAL HANDLING
This field contains any special instructions with regard to the handling of the message at the receiver's end.
<PRIVATE> means that the message reception process should not aid the user in circulating copies to others.
Plain text may also be included in this field.
