- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   Per this document, IANA has made changes to a number of\
    \ IANA\n   registries related to Transport Layer Security (TLS) and Datagram\n\
    \   Transport Layer Security (DTLS).  These changes were almost entirely\n   motivated\
    \ by the development of TLS 1.3 [RFC8446].\n   The changes introduced by this\
    \ document range from simple, e.g.,\n   adding notes, to complex, e.g., changing\
    \ a registry's registration\n   policy.  Instead of listing the changes and their\
    \ rationale here in\n   the introduction, each section provides rationale for\
    \ the proposed\n   change(s).\n   This document proposes no changes to the registration\
    \ policies for\n   TLS Alerts [RFC8446], TLS ContentType [RFC8446], TLS HandshakeType\n\
    \   [RFC8446], and TLS Certificate Status Types [RFC6961] registries; the\n  \
    \ existing policies (Standards Action for the first three; IETF Review\n   for\
    \ the last), are appropriate for these one-byte code points because\n   of their\
    \ scarcity.\n"
- title: 2.  Terminology
  contents:
  - "2.  Terminology\n   The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\"\
    , \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"NOT RECOMMENDED\"\
    , \"MAY\", and\n   \"OPTIONAL\" in this document are to be interpreted as described\
    \ in\n   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all\n\
    \   capitals, as shown here.\n"
- title: 3.  Adding "TLS" to Registry Names
  contents:
  - "3.  Adding \"TLS\" to Registry Names\n   For consistency amongst TLS registries,\
    \ IANA has prepended \"TLS\" to\n   the following registries:\n   o  Application-Layer\
    \ Protocol Negotiation (ALPN) Protocol IDs\n      [RFC7301],\n   o  ExtensionType\
    \ Values,\n   o  Heartbeat Message Types [RFC6520], and\n   o  Heartbeat Modes\
    \ [RFC6520].\n   IANA has updated the reference for these four registries to also\n\
    \   refer to this document.  The remainder of this document will use the\n   registry\
    \ names with the \"TLS\" prefix.\n"
- title: 4.  Aligning with RFC 8126
  contents:
  - "4.  Aligning with RFC 8126\n   Many of the TLS-related IANA registries had the\
    \ registration\n   procedure \"IETF Consensus\", which was changed to \"IETF Review\"\
    \ by\n   [RFC8126].  To align with the new terminology, IANA has updated the\n\
    \   following registries to \"IETF Review\":\n   o  TLS Authorization Data Formats\
    \ [RFC4680]\n   o  TLS Supplemental Data Formats (SupplementalDataType) [RFC5878]\n\
    \   This is not a universal change, as some registries originally defined\n  \
    \ with \"IETF Consensus\" are undergoing other changes either as a result\n  \
    \ of this document, [RFC8446], or [RFC8422].\n   IANA has updated the reference\
    \ for these two registries to also refer\n   to this document.\n"
- title: 5.  Adding "Recommended" Column
  contents:
  - "5.  Adding \"Recommended\" Column\n   Per this document, a \"Recommended\" column\
    \ has been added to many of\n   the TLS registries to indicate parameters that\
    \ are generally\n   recommended for implementations to support.  Adding a \"Recommended\"\
    \n   parameter (i.e., \"Y\") to a registry or updating a parameter to\n   \"Recommended\"\
    \ status requires Standards Action.  Not all parameters\n   defined in Standards\
    \ Track documents need to be marked as\n   \"Recommended\".\n   If an item is\
    \ not marked as \"Recommended\" (i.e., \"N\"), it does not\n   necessarily mean\
    \ that it is flawed; rather, it indicates that the\n   item either has not been\
    \ through the IETF consensus process, has\n   limited applicability, or is intended\
    \ only for specific use cases.\n"
- title: 6.  Session Ticket TLS Extension
  contents:
  - "6.  Session Ticket TLS Extension\n   The nomenclature for the registry entries\
    \ in the TLS ExtensionType\n   Values registry correspond to the presentation\
    \ language field name\n   except for entry 35.  To ensure that the values in the\
    \ registry are\n   consistently identified in the registry, IANA:\n   o  has renamed\
    \ entry 35 to \"session_ticket (renamed from\n      \"SessionTicket TLS\")\" [RFC5077].\n\
    \   o  has added a reference to this document in the \"Reference\" column\n  \
    \    for entry 35.\n"
- title: 7.  TLS ExtensionType Values
  contents:
  - "7.  TLS ExtensionType Values\n   Experience has shown that the IETF Review registry\
    \ policy for TLS\n   extensions was too strict.  Based on WG consensus, the decision\
    \ was\n   taken to change the registration policy to Specification Required\n\
    \   [RFC8126] while reserving a small part of the code space for private\n   use.\
    \  Therefore, IANA has updated the TLS ExtensionType Values\n   registry as follows:\n\
    \   o  Changed the registry policy to:\n      Values with the first byte in the\
    \ range 0-254 (decimal) are\n      assigned via Specification Required [RFC8126].\
    \  Values with the\n      first byte 255 (decimal) are reserved for Private Use\
    \ [RFC8126].\n   o  Updated the \"Reference\" to also refer to this document.\n\
    \   See Section 17 for additional information about the designated expert\n  \
    \ pool.\n   Despite wanting to \"loosen\" the registration policies for TLS\n\
    \   extensions, it is still useful to indicate in the IANA registry which\n  \
    \ extensions the WG recommends be supported.  Therefore, IANA has\n   updated\
    \ the TLS ExtensionType Values registry as follows:\n   o  Added a \"Recommended\"\
    \ column with the contents as listed below.\n      This table has been generated\
    \ by marking Standards Track RFCs as\n      \"Y\" and all others as \"N\".  The\
    \ \"Recommended\" column is assigned a\n      value of \"N\" unless explicitly\
    \ requested, and adding a value with\n      a \"Recommended\" value of \"Y\" requires\
    \ Standards Action [RFC8126].\n      IESG Approval is REQUIRED for a Y->N transition.\n\

    \   IANA has added the following notes:\n   Note:  The role of the designated\
    \ expert is described in RFC 8447.\n      The designated expert [RFC8126] ensures\
    \ that the specification is\n      publicly available.  It is sufficient to have\
    \ an Internet-Draft\n      (that is posted and never published as an RFC) or a\
    \ document from\n      another standards body, industry consortium, university\
    \ site, etc.\n      The expert may provide more in-depth reviews, but their approval\n\
    \      should not be taken as an endorsement of the extension.\n   Note:  As specified\
    \ in [RFC8126], assignments made in the Private Use\n      space are not generally\
    \ useful for broad interoperability.  It is\n      the responsibility of those\
    \ making use of the Private Use range to\n      ensure that no conflicts occur\
    \ (within the intended scope of use).\n      For widespread experiments, temporary\
    \ reservations are available.\n   Note:  If an item is not marked as \"Recommended\"\
    , it does not\n      necessarily mean that it is flawed; rather, it indicates\
    \ that the\n      item either has not been through the IETF consensus process,\
    \ has\n      limited applicability, or is intended only for specific use cases.\n\
    \   The extensions added by [RFC8446] are omitted from the above table;\n   additionally,\
    \ token_binding is omitted, since [TOKBIND] specifies the\n   value of the \"\
    Recommended\" column for this extension.\n   [RFC8446] also uses the TLS ExtensionType\
    \ Values registry originally\n   created in [RFC4366].  The following text is\
    \ from [RFC8446] and is\n   included here to ensure alignment between these specifications.\n\
    \   o  IANA has updated this registry to include the \"key_share\",\n      \"\

    \ with the values defined in\n      [RFC8446] and the \"Recommended\" value of\
    \ \"Y\".\n   o  IANA has updated this registry to include a \"TLS 1.3\" column\
    \ that\n      lists the messages in which the extension may appear.  This column\n\
    \      has been initially populated from the table in Section 4.2 of\n      [RFC8446]\

    \   mailing list, on the advice of one or more designated experts.\n   However,\
    \ to allow for the allocation of values prior to publication,\n   the designated\
    \ experts may approve registration once they are\n   satisfied that such a specification\
    \ will be published.\n   Registration requests sent to the mailing list for review\
    \ SHOULD use\n   an appropriate subject (e.g., \"Request to register value in\
    \ TLS bar\n   registry\").\n   Within the review period, the designated experts\
    \ will either approve\n   or deny the registration request, communicating this\
    \ decision to the\n   review list and IANA.  Denials SHOULD include an explanation\
    \ and, if\n   applicable, suggestions as to how to make the request successful.\n\
    \   Registration requests that are undetermined for a period longer than\n   21\
    \ days can be brought to the IESG's attention (using the\n   <iesg@ietf.org> mailing\
    \ list) for resolution.\n   Criteria that SHOULD be applied by the designated\
    \ experts includes\n   determining whether the proposed registration duplicates\
    \ existing\n   functionality, whether it is likely to be of general applicability\
    \ or\n   useful only for a single application, and whether the registration\n\
    \   description is clear.\n   IANA MUST only accept registry updates from the\
    \ designated experts\n   and SHOULD direct all requests for registration to the\
    \ review mailing\n   list.\n   It is suggested that multiple designated experts\
    \ be appointed who are\n   able to represent the perspectives of different applications\
    \ using\n   this specification, in order to enable broadly informed review of\n\
    \   registration decisions.  In cases where a registration decision could\n  \
    \ be perceived as creating a conflict of interest for a particular\n   Expert,\
    \ that Expert SHOULD defer to the judgment of the other\n   Experts.\n"

  - "18.  Security Considerations\n   The change to Specification Required from IETF\
    \ Review lowers the\n   amount of review provided by the WG for cipher suites\
    \ and supported\n   groups.  This change reflects reality in that the WG essentially\n\
    \   provided no cryptographic review of the cipher suites or supported\n   groups.\
    \  This was especially true of national cipher suites.\n   Recommended algorithms\
    \ are regarded as secure for general use at the\n   time of registration; however,\
    \ cryptographic algorithms and\n   parameters will be broken or weakened over\
    \ time.  It is possible that\n   the \"Recommended\" status in the registry lags\
    \ behind the most recent\n   advances in cryptanalysis.  Implementers and users\
    \ need to check that\n   the cryptographic algorithms listed continue to provide\
    \ the expected\n   level of security.\n   Designated experts ensure the specification\
    \ is publicly available.\n   They may provide more in-depth reviews.  Their review\
    \ should not be\n   taken as an endorsement of the cipher suite, extension, supported\n\
    \   group, etc.\n"
