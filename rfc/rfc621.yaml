  - "                    NIC USER DIRECTORIES AT SRI-ARC\nOn Friday evening 8-Mar-74,\
    \ we will delete all those directories at\nSRI-ARC that belonged to NIC users\
    \ who were transferred to OFFICE-1.\nSimultaneous1y, there is to be a change at\
    \ each Network Host such that\nthe Hostname \"NIC\" will refer to OFFICE-1 (Host\
    \ 53 octal), not to SRI-\nARC. (See RFC# 620, NIC# 21993)\nThe effect of these\
    \ changes is that Network mail sent to NIC users in\nthe form\n    \"nicusername@NIC\"\
    \nwill be delivered to OFFICE-1, as it should.\nBut if such mail is sent to\n\
    \    \"nicusername@SRI-ARC\"\nit will not be accepted at SRI-ARC, because the\
    \ NIC user's username will\nbe no longer be known there.\nPLEASE NOTE THAT IT\
    \ IS YOUR RESPONSIBILITY TO READ ANY NETWORK MAIL THAT\nWAS DELIVERED TO YOU AT\
    \ SRI-ARC PRIOR TO FRIDAY EVENING 8-MARCH.  THIS\nMAIL WILL BE DELETED AT THAT\
    \ TIME.\n       [ This RFC was put into machine readable form for entry ]\n  \
    \     [ into the online RFC archives by Alex McKenzie with    ]\n       [ support\
    \ from GTE, formerly BBN Corp.           1/2000 ]\n"
