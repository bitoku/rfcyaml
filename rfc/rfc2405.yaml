  - "1. Introduction\n   This document describes the use of the DES Cipher algorithm\
    \ in Cipher\n   Block Chaining Mode as a confidentiality mechanism within the\
    \ context\n   of the Encapsulating Security Payload.\n   DES is a symmetric block\
    \ cipher algorithm. The algorithm is described\n   in [FIPS-46-2][FIPS-74][FIPS-81].\
    \ [Schneier96] provides a general\n   description of Cipher Block Chaining Mode,\
    \ a mode which is applicable\n   to several encryption algorithms.\n   As specified\
    \ in this memo, DES-CBC is not an authentication\n   mechanism. [Although DES-MAC,\
    \ described in [Schneier96] amongst other\n   places, does provide authentication,\
    \ DES-MAC is not discussed here.]\n   For further information on how the various\
    \ pieces of ESP fit together\n   to provide security services, refer to [ESP]\
    \ and [road].\n   The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\"\

- title: 3. ESP Payload
  contents:
  - "3. ESP Payload\n   DES-CBC requires an explicit Initialization Vector (IV) of\
    \ 8 octets\n   (64 bits).  This IV immediately precedes the protected (encrypted)\n\
    \   payload. The IV MUST be a random value.\n   Including the IV in each datagram\
    \ ensures that decryption of each\n   received datagram can be performed, even\
    \ when some datagrams are\n   dropped, or datagrams are re-ordered in transit.\n\
    \   Implementation note:\n      Common practice is to use random data for the\
    \ first IV and the\n      last 8 octets of encrypted data from an encryption process\
    \ as the\n      IV for the next encryption process; this logically extends the\
    \ CBC\n      across the packets. It also has the advantage of limiting the\n \
    \     leakage of information from the random number genrator. No matter\n    \
    \  which mechnism is used, the receiver MUST NOT assume any meaning\n      for\
    \ this value, other than that it is an IV.\n      To avoid ECB encryption of very\
    \ similar plaintext blocks in\n      different packets, implementations MUST NOT\
    \ use a counter or other\n      low-Hamming distance source for IVs.\n   The payload\
    \ field, as defined in [ESP], is broken down according to\n   the following diagram:\n\

- title: 4. Key Material
  contents:
  - "4. Key Material\n   DES-CBC is a symmetric secret key algorithm. The key size\
    \ is 64-bits.\n   [It is commonly known as a 56-bit key as the key has 56 significant\n\
    \   bits; the least significant bit in every byte is the parity bit.]\n   [arch]\
    \ describes the general mechanism to derive keying material for\n   the ESP transform.\
    \ The derivation of the key from some amount of\n   keying material does not differ\
    \ between the manually- and\n   automatically-keyed security associations.\n \
    \  This mechanism MUST derive a 64-bit key value for use by this cipher.\n   The\
    \ mechanism will derive raw key values, the derivation process\n   itself is not\
    \ responsible for handling parity or weak key checks.\n   Weak key checks SHOULD\
    \ be performed. If such a key is found, the key\n   SHOULD be rejected and a new\
    \ SA requested.\n   Implementation note:\n      If an implementation chooses to\
    \ do weak key checking, it should\n      recognize that the known weak keys [FIPS74]\
    \ have been adjusted for\n      parity. Otherwise the handling of parity is a\
    \ local issue.\n   A strong pseudo-random function MUST be used to generate the\
    \ required\n   key. For a discussion on this topic, reference [RFC1750].\n"
- title: 4.1 Weak Keys
  contents:
  - "4.1 Weak Keys\n   DES has 16 known weak keys, including so-called semi-weak keys.\
    \  The\n   list of weak keys can be found in [FIPS74].\n"
- title: 4.2 Key Lifetime
  contents:
  - "4.2 Key Lifetime\n   [Blaze96] discusses the costs and key recovery time for\
    \ brute force\n   attacks. It presents various combinations of total cost/time\
    \ to\n   recover a key/cost per key recovered for 40-bit and 56-bit DES keys,\n\
    \   based on late 1995 estimates.\n   While a brute force search of a 56-bit DES\
    \ keyspace can be considered\n   infeasable for the so-called casual hacker, who\
    \ is simply using spare\n   CPU cycles or other low-cost resources, it is within\
    \ reach of someone\n   willing to spend a bit more money.\n   For example, for\
    \ a cost of $300,000, a 56-bit DES key can be\n   recovered in an average of 19\
    \ days using off-the-shelf technology and\n   in only 3 hours using a custom developed\
    \ chip.\n   It should be noted that there are other attacks which can recover\
    \ the\n   key faster, that brute force attacks are considered the \"worst case\"\
    ,\n   although the easiest to implement.\n   [Wiener94] also discusses a $1M machine\
    \ which can break a DES key in\n   3.5 hours (1993 estimates), using a known-plaintext\
    \ attack. As\n   discussed in the Security Considerations section, a known plaintext\n\
    \   attack is reasonably likely.\n   It should also be noted that over time, the\
    \ total and average search\n   costs as well as the average key recovery time\
    \ will continue to drop.\n   While the above does not provide specific recommendations\
    \ for key\n   lifetime, it does reinforce the point that for a given application\n\
    \   the desired key lifetime is dependent upon the perceived threat (an\n   educated\
    \ guess as to the amount of resources available to the\n   attacker) relative\
    \ to the worth of the data to be protected.\n   While there are no recommendations\
    \ for volume-based lifetimes made\n   here, it shoud be noted that given sufficient\
    \ volume there is an\n   increased probabilty that known plaintext can be accumulated.\n"
- title: 5. Interaction with Authentication Algorithms
  contents:
  - "5. Interaction with Authentication Algorithms\n   As of this writing, there are\
    \ no known issues which preclude the use\n   of the DES-CBC algorithm with any\
    \ specific authentication algorithm.\n"
- title: 6. Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "6. Security Considerations\n   [Much of this section was originally written by\
    \ William Allen Simpson\n   and Perry Metzger.]\n   Users need to understand that\
    \ the quality of the security provided by\n   this specification depends completely\
    \ on the strength of the DES\n   algorithm, the correctness of that algorithm's\
    \ implementation, the\n   security of the Security Association management mechanism\
    \ and its\n   implementation, the strength of the key [CN94], and upon the\n \
    \  correctness of the implementations in all of the participating nodes.\n   [Bell95]\
    \ and [Bell96] describe a cut and paste splicing attack which\n   applies to all\
    \ Cipher Block Chaining algorithms. This attack can be\n   addressed with the\
    \ use of an authentication mechanism.\n   The use of the cipher mechanism without\
    \ any corresponding\n   authentication mechanism is strongly discouraged. This\
    \ cipher can be\n   used in an ESP transform that also includes authentication;\
    \ it can\n   also be used in an ESP transform that doesn't include authentication\n\
    \   provided there is an companion AH header. Refer to [ESP], [AH],\n   [arch],\
    \ and [road] for more details.\n   When the default ESP padding is used, the padding\
    \ bytes have a\n   predictable value.  They provide a small measure of tamper\
    \ detection\n   on their own block and the previous block in CBC mode.  This makes\
    \ it\n   somewhat harder to perform splicing attacks, and avoids a possible\n\
    \   covert channel.  This small amount of known plaintext does not create\n  \
    \ any problems for modern ciphers.\n   At the time of writing of this document,\
    \ [BS93] demonstrated a\n   differential cryptanalysis based chosen-plaintext\
    \ attack requiring\n   2^47 plaintext-ciphertext pairs, where the size of a pair\
    \ is the size\n   of a DES block (64 bits). [Matsui94] demonstrated a linear\n\
    \   cryptanalysis based known-plaintext attack requiring only 2^43\n   plaintext-ciphertext\
    \ pairs.  Although these attacks are not\n   considered practical, they must be\
    \ taken into account.\n   More disturbingly, [Wiener94] has shown the design of\
    \ a DES cracking\n   machine costing $1 Million that can crack one key every 3.5\
    \ hours.\n   This is an extremely practical attack.\n   One or two blocks of known\
    \ plaintext suffice to recover a DES key.\n   Because IP datagrams typically begin\
    \ with a block of known and/or\n   guessable header text, frequent key changes\
    \ will not protect against\n   this attack.\n   It is suggested that DES is not\
    \ a good encryption algorithm for the\n   protection of even moderate value information\
    \ in the face of such\n   equipment.  Triple DES is probably a better choice for\
    \ such purposes.\n   However, despite these potential risks, the level of privacy\
    \ provided\n   by use of ESP DES-CBC in the Internet environment is far greater\
    \ than\n   sending the datagram as cleartext.\n   The case for using random values\
    \ for IVs has been refined with the\n   following summary provided by Steve Bellovin.\
    \ Refer to [Bell97] for\n   further information.\n      \"The problem arises if\
    \ you use a counter as an IV, or some other\n      source with a low Hamming distance\
    \ between successive IVs, for\n      encryption in CBC mode.  In CBC mode, the\
    \ \"effective plaintext\"\n      for an encryption is the XOR of the actual plaintext\
    \ and the\n      ciphertext of the preceeding block.  Normally, that's a random\n\
    \      value, which means that the effective plaintext is quite random.\n    \
    \  That's good, because many blocks of actual plaintext don't change\n      very\
    \ much from packet to packet, either.\n      For the first block of plaintext,\
    \ though, the IV takes the place\n      of the previous block of ciphertext. \
    \ If the IV doesn't differ\n      much from the previous IV, and the actual plaintext\
    \ block doesn't\n      differ much from the previous packet's, then the effective\n\
    \      plaintext won't differ much, either.  This means that you have\n      pairs\
    \ of ciphertext blocks combined with plaintext blocks that\n      differ in just\
    \ a few bit positions.  This can be a wedge for\n      assorted cryptanalytic\
    \ attacks.\"\n   The discussion on IVs has been updated to require that an\n \
    \  implementation not use a low-Hamming distance source for IVs.\n"
