  - "1. Introduction\n   The ISSN International Centre has undertaken in 1999-2000\
    \ an URN\n   implementation taking advantage of the functional compatibility\n\
    \   between the ISSN and the URN.\n   The present implementation at the ISSN-IC\
    \ Centre based on IETF RFCs\n   on URN includes a centralised resolution system\
    \ which allows direct\n   access to electronic resources by using the ISSN identifiers\
    \ as\n   Uniform Resource Names within an ISSN URN Namespace.\n   It demonstrates\
    \ that the URN can integrate existing identifiers from\n   well established identification\
    \ schemes used by the bibliographic\n   community.\n   Nevertheless, to deploy\
    \ this demonstrator into a wider operational\n   system a responsible body or\
    \ infrastructure is needed to assign\n   namespaces and manage an RDS/NAPTR global\
    \ resolution framework.  It\n   is intended here that serials refer to all forms\
    \ of serials published\n   in printed form as well as in form of electronic resources.\
    \  Since\n   this document contains a Registration form for an ISSN URN Namespace,\n\
    \   this form also includes some paragraphs already present in other\n   parts\
    \ of this document.\n   All figures and descriptions are dated 13 July 2000.\n"
- title: 2. The ISSN system
  contents:
  - "2. The ISSN system\n   The ISSN system results from a joint UNESCO and ICSU-AB\
    \ working group\n   on bibliographic descriptions set up in 1967 in order to establish\
    \ a\n   world registry of serial titles currently issued, stored or archived.\n\
    \   Today, the ISSN system which is defined by an International standard\n   (ISO\
    \ 3297), relies on two main data elements:\n   The International Standard Serial\
    \ Number which is a unique identifier\n   for a specific serial publication.\n\
    \   The key-title, which is a unique name assigned to a serial, and is\n   inseparably\
    \ linked with its ISSN.\n   And on a well established framework: the ISSN International\
    \ network.\n"
- title: 2.1 The ISSN code
  contents:
  - "2.1 The ISSN code\n   The ISSN - International Standard Serials Number is defined\
    \ in the\n   ISO standard 3297:1998 as a code for the unique identification of\n\
    \   serials.\n   This standard states that:\n   Each ISSN is a unique identifier\
    \ for a specific serial publication.\n   ISSN are applicable to the entire population\
    \ of serials, whether\n   past, present or to be published in the foreseeable\
    \ future, whatever\n   the medium of publication.\n   Serials include periodicals,\
    \ newspapers, annuals (such as reports,\n   yearbooks, directories, etc.), and\
    \ the journals, series, memoirs,\n   proceedings, transactions, etc., of societies.\n\
    \   Today, ISSN are assigned to data bases and electronic serial\n   resources.\
    \  Further broadening of the scope to continuing resources\n   is under discussion.\n"
- title: 2.2 Construction of ISSN
  contents:
  - "2.2 Construction of ISSN\n   The ISO 3297 standard states that:\n   An ISSN consists\
    \ of eight digits in arabic numerals 0 to 9, except\n   the last digit which is\
    \ a check digit and can be sometimes an X.  The\n   ISSN has no internal meaningful\
    \ elements to identify language,\n   country, publisher [or medium.]\n   The check\
    \ digit is always located in the extreme right position and\n   is calculated\
    \ on a modulus 11 basis with weights 8 to 2, using X in\n   lieu of 10 where 10\
    \ would occur as a check digit.\n   Each ISSN is inseparably linked a \"the key\
    \ title\".  The Key title is\n   a form of the title which is constructed in order\
    \ to avoid duplicates\n   so that each key title is unique in the ISSN Data base\
    \ also named the\n   ISSN Register.  ISSN and key titles are equivalent, they\
    \ both\n   identify without ambiguity a same serial.\n   When printed or displayed\
    \ the ISSN is preceded by the ISSN prefix and\n   a space, and shall appear as\
    \ two groups of four digits separated by a\n   hyphen.\n   examples  ISSN 0000-0019\
    \   ISSN 1560-1560\n   ISSN are constructed and distributed by the ISSN International\
    \ Centre\n   to National Centres for assignment.\n"

    \ key-title some thirty\n   bibliographic data elements enabling the unambiguous\
    \ and secure\n   identification of a serial.\n   One characteristic of an ISSN\
    \ bibliographic record is that it\n   contains other ISSN in linking fields in\
    \ order to establish\n   relationships between the given serial and a set of other\
    \ related\n   serials already identified.\n   To recognise and to allow access\
    \ to serial resources in digital form,\n   the ISSN format has included additional\
    \ data elements:\n   -  A medium code which indicates the medium of the given\
    \ serial\n   -  A linking field to express relations between the different forms\n\
    \      of \"equivalent\" serials on different media (from printed version\n  \
    \    to online as well as from online to printed)\n   -  The location of an electronic\

  - "3.1 ISSN compliance with URN requirements\n   The different specifications and\
    \ requirements on URNs have been\n   studied from the following documents:\n \
    \  URN Syntax\n   (RFC 2141, May 1997 - R. Moats)\n   Using Existing Bibliographic\
    \ Identifiers as Uniform Resource Names\n   (RFC 2288 February 1998 - C. Lynch,\
    \ R. Daniel)\n   Functional Requirements for Uniform Resource Names\n   (RFC 1737,\
    \ December 1994 - K. Sollins, L. Masinter)\n   URN Namespace Definition Mechanisms\n\
    \   (RFC 2611, June 1999 - L. Daigle, R. Iannella)\n   A URN Namespace for IETF\
    \ Documents\n   (RFC 2648, August 1999 - R. Moats)\n   Requirements for URNs'\
    \ functional capabilities (from RFC 1737)\n   Global scope: A URN is a name with\
    \ global scope which does not imply\n   a location.  It has the same meaning everywhere.\n\
    \   -  Applicable for ISSN.  Accordingly to ISO standard 3297 there is no\n  \
    \    limitations for serial resource identification.\n   Global uniqueness: The\
    \ same URN will never be assigned to two\n   different resources.\n   -  Applicable\
    \ for ISSN.  By definition an ISSN is assigned to one and\n      only one serial\
    \ resource.  Once assigned, an ISSN is never re-\n      assigned.\n   Persistence:\
    \ The lifetime of a URN is permanent.\n   -  Applicable for ISSN.  All ISSN are\
    \ registered in the ISSN Register\n      data base which covers current serial\
    \ resources as well as ceased.\n   Scalability: URNs can be assigned to any resource\
    \ that might\n   conceivably be available on the network, for hundreds of years.\n\
    \   -  Applicable for ISSN.  More than 98500000 ISSN have yet been\n      assigned.\n\
    \   Legacy support: The scheme must permit the support of existing legacy\n  \
    \ naming systems.\n   -  Applicable for ISSN.  By definition the ISSN system is\
    \ a legacy\n      identification system for serial resources.\n   Independence:\
    \ It is solely the responsibility of a name issuing\n   authority to determine\
    \ the conditions under which it will issue a\n   name.\n   -  Applicable for ISSN.\
    \  By definition of the ISSN system.\n   Resolution: For URNs that have corresponding\
    \ URLs, there must be some\n   feasible mechanism to translate a URN to a URL.\n\
    \   -  Applicable for ISSN.  The ISSN-IC has developed an ISSN URN\n      resolver\
    \ which translates one given ISSN into one or several URLs.\n   In addition to\
    \ these basic requirements on the functional elements of\n   the URNs, there are\
    \ other requirements for how they are encoded in a\n   string:\n   Single encoding,\
    \ Simple comparison, Simple human transcribability,\n   Transport friendliness,\
    \ Machine consumption, Text recognition.\n   -  Applicable to ISSN.  As defined\
    \ in the ISO standard the ISSN is a\n      very simple and short character string\
    \ which fully responds to\n      those requirements.\n   Considering the aim of\
    \ the ISSN, its framework and new developments\n   for electronic serial resources\
    \ identification, we can state that the\n   ISSN fulfills all expressed URN requirements.\n\
    \   Syntax requirements\n   Considering syntax requirements (RFC2141) for an URN\
    \ namespace and\n   the URN syntax, an ISSN based URN namespace is compliant with\
    \ such\n   requirements since it does not use any reserved characters.\n   In\
    \ RFC 2288 (4.2 Encoding Considerations and Lexical Equivalence) it\n   is stated\
    \ that:\n   There is no problem representing ISSN in the namespace - specific\n\
    \   string of URNs since all characters valid in the ISSN are valid in\n   the\
    \ namespace-specific URN string, and %-encoding is never required.\n   Example:\
    \ urn:ISSN:1046-8188\n   Supplementary comparison rules are also appropriate for\
    \ the ISSN\n   namespace, hyphens should be dropped prior to comparison and\n\
    \   occurrences of 'x' normalised to uppercase.\n"

  - "3.2 Identification and access\n   The role of an URN is also to provide safe\
    \ access to the\n   characteristics of a resource and to the resource itself.\
    \  One may\n   view an ISSN bibliographic record as a metadata since it contains\n\
    \   different data information on the resource which is to be identified,\n  \
    \ described, located and/or accessed.\n   The ISSN is widely used as an identification\
    \ number for serial\n   resources.  Since the ISSN Network provides the URLs corresponding\

- title: 4.1. Overview of the ISSN URN Resolution system
  contents:
  - "4.1. Overview of the ISSN URN Resolution system\n   Using ISSN as Uniform Resource\
    \ Name implies that some mapping\n   mechanism is provided to ensure a reliable\
    \ access to available\n   resources when using Internet tools like a standard\
    \ Web browser.\n   From the technical point of view this has led to develop within\
    \ our\n   system the different pieces of software and services required to\n \
    \  fulfill such aim.\n   The resolution software be able to translate a given\
    \ ISSN-URN into\n   electronic locations:\n   -  location of the bibliographic\
    \ description or metadata\n   -  location of the periodical itself (if it is in\
    \ electronic form).\n   These electronic locations are expressed in form of URLs\
    \ for which\n   persistence is not ensured.  As a consequence the URLs which are\n\
    \   stored for resolution have to be checked and updated to ensure\n   relevant\
    \ mapping with the corresponding URNs.\n   The URLs which are stored in the database\
    \ must be checked regularly\n   for accuracy and if changes occur they have to\
    \ be reported in the\n   ISSN-URN resolver database.\n   The browser has to include\
    \ the URN facility which allows to express\n   the location of a given resource\
    \ in form of an ISSN, this means that\n   if the standard browsers do not include\
    \ the URN option a \"plug-in\" is\n   to be developed.\n   Thus, four types of\
    \ developments have been considered:\n   Design and implementation of a resolver:\n\
    \   -  In a first step a global centralised resolution system has been\n     \
    \ developed and implemented on one resolution server located at the\n      ISSN\
    \ International Centre.\n   It ensures effective mapping between a given ISSN\
    \ and one or several\n   URL(s) which implies that \"multiple resolution\" is\
    \ performed by\n   design and implementation of an ISSN-URL mapping file.\n  \
    \ -  Today, the principal method to map ISSN with URLs is to extract\n      them\
    \ from ISSN registered records and to store them in a separate\n      file structured\
    \ specially for the resolution process.  Besides,\n      other ways to get URLs\
    \ for bibliographic resources identified by\n      ISSN are tested.  Management\
    \ data as well as attributes are linked\n      to URLs in order to recognise objects\
    \ handled by the resolver.\n   Design and implementation of an URL checker:\n\
    \   -  In order to control the persistence and the accessibility to\n      ISSN-URN\
    \ a robot called the \"URL Watcher\" has been written to\n      control the status\
    \ of all URLs stored in the ISSN-URL mapping\n      file.  Broken or redirected\
    \ URLs are detected and stored to permit\n      efficient resolution.\n   Design\
    \ and implementation of a browser plug-in:\n   -  The existing browsers do not\
    \ include today the URN \"protocol\"\n      functionality.  One expect to have\
    \ it implemented in a near\n      future.  A plug-in for Netscape communicator\
    \ and MS-Explorer has\n      been developed and is available.\n   This enables\
    \ to enter directly the ISSN preceded by the string\n   \"urn:ISSN:\" in the browsers\
    \ address box instead of typing the URL and\n   as result to get displayed the\
    \ bibliographic record or/and the online\n   resource.  Clicking on an ISSN on\
    \ an HTML page gives the same result.\n      example: urn:ISSN:1560-1560\n"
- title: 4.2 Global resolution
  contents:
  - "4.2 Global resolution\n   Since the ISSN system is not addressing a local environment\
    \ (like a\n   given Library) and is expected to be linked to other URNs (or other\n\
    \   identification services) for identification of serial related\n   resources\
    \ having other levels of granularity, we have to consider an\n   evolution of\
    \ the present resolution implementation to a global\n   resolution system.\n \
    \  Resolution and especially global resolution is considered as a major\n   issue\
    \ for becoming an ISSN URN Namespace.\n   This is expressed in the following statement\
    \ (from RFC 2611, \"URN\n   Namespace Definition Mechanisms\"):\n   Process for\
    \ identifier resolution:\n      If a namespace is intended to be accessible for\
    \ global resolution,\n      it must be registered in an RDS (Resolution Discovery\
    \ System, see\n      [RFC2276]) such as NAPTR.  Resolution then proceeds according\
    \ to\n      standard URI resolution processes, and the mechanisms of the RDS.\n\
    \   Our present views and evaluations to be integrated in such RDS System\n  \
    \ for global resolution for an ISSN URN Namespace are mainly based on\n   concepts\
    \ and proposals from the following RFCs:\n   RFC 2276 for RDS architecture for\
    \ global resolution,\n   RFC 2168 for the NAPTR DNS extension,\n   From a technical\
    \ point of view our present resolution system is\n   flexible enough to take place\
    \ in a RDS/NAPTR resolution framework.\n"

    \     Today, the ISSN database contains more than 950 000 bibliographic\n    \
    \  records and a special attention is given to electronic publication\n      resources\
    \ and related metadata, and the way to access them.\n   Process for identifier\
    \ resolution:\n      As a first step the ISSN International Centre has developed\
    \ a\n      centralised ISSN-URN resolver with multiple resolution\n      capabilities\
    \ which runs as a demonstrator.\n      In a second step we expect the ISSN Namespace\
    \ to be accessible for\n      global resolution and to provide a set of resolution\
    \ services\n      compliant with the RDS/NAPTR proposals.\n   Rules for Lexical\
    \ Equivalence:\n      The check digit if 'X' is case-sensitive.\n      Thus, if\
    \ \"x\" is found it must be translated in upper case.\n      The hyphen between\
    \ the 4th and the 5th digit can be omitted\n   Conformance with URN Syntax:\n\
    \      There are no characters reserved.\n"
