  contents:
  - "Abstract\n   This memo defines an extension to the Management Information Base\n\
    \   (MIB) for use with network management protocols in TCP/IP-based\n   internets.\
    \  In particular, it defines objects for managing DS3 and E3\n   Interfaces. \
    \ This document is a companion document with Definitions\n   of Managed Objects\
    \ for the DS1 Interface Type.\n   This document entirely replaces RFC 1233, which\
    \ contains a\n   fundamental error: many objects are encoded as Counters that\
    \ must be\n   encoded as INTEGERs or Gauges.  The magnitude of the change required\n\
    \   is sufficient that virtually every object changed.  Therefore, the\n   MIB\
    \ documented in RFC 1233 should not be implemented.\n"

- title: 1.  The Network Management Framework
  contents:
  - "1.  The Network Management Framework\n   The Internet-standard Network Management\
    \ Framework consists of three\n   components.  They are:\n      STD 16/RFC 1155\
    \ which defines the SMI, the mechanisms used for\n      describing and naming\
    \ objects for the purpose of management.  STD\n      16/RFC 1212 defines a more\
    \ concise description mechanism, which is\n      wholly consistent with the SMI.\n\
    \      RFC 1156 which defines MIB-I, the core set of managed objects for\n   \
    \   the Internet suite of protocols.  STD 17/RFC 1213, defines MIB-II,\n     \
    \ an evolution of MIB-I based on implementation experience and new\n      operational\
    \ requirements.\n      STD 15/RFC 1157 which defines the SNMP, the protocol used\
    \ for\n      network access to managed objects.\n   The Framework permits new\
    \ objects to be defined for the purpose of\n   experimentation and evaluation.\n"
- title: 2.  Objects
  contents:
  - "2.  Objects\n   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store,\
    \ termed\n   the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are\n\
    \   defined using the subset of Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1) [7]\n   defined\
    \ in the SMI.  In particular, each object has a name, a syntax,\n   and an encoding.\
    \  The name is an object identifier, an\n   administratively assigned name, which\
    \ specifies an object type.  The\n   object type together with an object instance\
    \ serves to uniquely\n   identify a specific instantiation of the object.  For\
    \ human\n   convenience, we often use a textual string, termed the OBJECT\n  \
    \ DESCRIPTOR, to also refer to the object type.\n   The syntax of an object type\
    \ defines the abstract data structure\n   corresponding to that object type. \
    \ The ASN.1 language is used for\n   this purpose.  However, the SMI [3] purposely\
    \ restricts the ASN.1\n   constructs which may be used.  These restrictions are\
    \ explicitly made\n   for simplicity.\n   The encoding of an object type is simply\
    \ how that object type is\n   represented using the object type's syntax.  Implicitly\
    \ tied to the\n   notion of an object type's syntax and encoding is how the object\
    \ type\n   is represented when being transmitted on the network.  The SMI\n  \
    \ specifies the use of the basic encoding rules of ASN.1 [8], subject\n   to the\
    \ additional requirements imposed by the SNMP.\n"
- title: 2.1.  Format of Definitions
  contents:
  - "2.1.  Format of Definitions\n   Section 4 contains contains the specification\
    \ of all object types\n   contained in this MIB module.  The object types are\
    \ defined using the\n   conventions defined in the SMI, as amended by the extensions\n\
    \   specified in STD 16, RFC 1212 [13].\n"
- title: 2.2.  Changes from RFC 1233
  contents:
  - "2.2.  Changes from RFC 1233\n   This MIB obsoletes RFC 1233.  The changes from\
    \ RFC 1233 are the\n   following:\n      --  This MIB module contains information\
    \ to manage\n          an E3 interface, also.\n      --  This MIB module contains\
    \ three groups:\n           DS3/E3 Near End Group which is mandatory,\n      \
    \     DS3 Far End Group which is optional, and\n           DS3 Fractional Group\

    \          configuration information and statistics\n          that are collected\
    \ from the far end DS3/E3 interface.\n          Presently, the Far End Group may\
    \ only be implemented by\n          DS3 systems that use C-bit Parity or SYNTRAN.\n\
    \      --  The DS3 Fractional Group is a new group and is\n          modeled after\
    \ the DS1 Fractional Group.\n      --  ds3CSUIndex has been redefined and renamed\n\
    \          to dsx3LineIndex.  This object\n          is the identifier of a DS3/E3\

    \ cross two DS3/E3\n          interfaces, which have separate dsx3LineIndex values.\n\
    \      --  ds3Index has been redefined and renamed to\n          dsx3IfIndex.\
    \  This value for this\n          object is equal to the value of ifIndex from\
    \ the Interfaces\n          table of MIB II (STD 17, RFC 1213).\n      --  The\
    \ ACCESS for objects in the dsx3ConfigTable has\n          been set to read-write\
    \ for items that are configurable.\n      --  The dsx3ZeroCoding has been renamed\
    \ to dsx3LineCoding.\n      --  A new object has been added called dsx3LoopbackConfig,\n\
    \          which better describes the loopback capabilities of\n          a DS3/E3\
    \ interface on a device.\n      --  The dsx3SendCode object has been updated to\
    \ reflect\n          different types of loopback messages.\n      --  A new object\
    \ has been added called dsx3LineStatus.\n          This object better describes\
    \ the status (e.g.,\n          failure state and loopback state) of a\n      \
    \    DS3/E3 interface.\n      --  A new object has been added called dsx3TransmitClockSource.\n\
    \          This object identifies the source for the transmit clock.\n      --\
    \  All Counters have been changed to Gauges.\n      --  A Line Errored Seconds\
    \ object has been added to\n          all near end tables.\n      --  Line Coding\
    \ Violations are counted instead of Bipolar\n          Violations.\n      -- \
    \ A new Coding Violation counter has been added to count\n          coding violations\
    \ reported via the C-bits of SYNTRAN\n          and C-bit Parity DS3 applications.\n\
    \          The original Coding Violation counter has been renamed\n          to\
    \ PCV to mean coding violations reported via the P-bits.\n          This count\
    \ is also added for symmetry with the far end\n          statistics.\n      --\
    \  A new Errored Second counter and Severely Errored Second\n          counter\
    \ has been added to count these performance events\n          via the C-bits of\
    \ the SYNTRAN and C-bit Parity DS3\n          applications.  The original ES and\
    \ SES counters have been\n          renamed to PES and PSES to mean reported via\
    \ the P-bits.\n          These counts are also added for symmetry with the far\

- title: 3.1.  Binding between ifIndex and DS3/E3 Interfaces
  contents:
  - "3.1.  Binding between ifIndex and DS3/E3 Interfaces\n   Different physical configurations\
    \ for the support of SNMP with DS3/E3\n   equipment exist. To accommodate these\
    \ scenarios, two different\n   indices for DS3/E3 interfaces are introduced in\
    \ this MIB.  These\n   indices are dsx3IfIndex and dsx3LineIndex.\n   External\
    \ interface scenario: the SNMP Agent represents all managed\n   DS3/E3 lines as\
    \ external interfaces (for example, an Agent residing\n   on the device supporting\
    \ DS3/E3 interfaces directly):\n   For this scenario, all interfaces are assigned\
    \ an integer value equal\n   to ifIndex, and the following applies:\n        \
    \     ifIndex=dsx3IfIndex=dsx3LineIndex for all interfaces.\n   The dsx3IfIndex\
    \ column of the DS3/E3 Configuration table relates each\n   DS3/E3 interface to\
    \ its corresponding interface (ifIndex) in the\n   Internet-standard MIB (MIB-II\
    \ STD 17, RFC 1213).\n   External&Internal interface scenario: the SNMP Agents\
    \ resides on an\n   host external from the device supporting DS3/E3 interfaces\
    \ (e.g., a\n   router). The Agent represents both the host and the DS3/E3 device.\n\
    \   The index dsx3LineIndex is used to not only represent the DS3/E3\n   interfaces\
    \ external from the host/DS3/E3-device combination, but also\n   the DS3/E3 interfaces\
    \ connecting the host and the DS3/E3 device.  The\n   index dsx3IfIndex is always\
    \ equal to ifIndex.\n   Example:\n   A shelf full of CSUs connected to a Router.\
    \ An SNMP Agent residing on\n   the router proxies for itself and the CSU. The\
    \ router has also an\n   Ethernet interface:\n          +-----+\n    |     | \

  - "3.3.1.  Error Events\n          Bipolar Violation (BPV) Error Event\n       \
    \     A bipolar violation error event, for B3ZS(HDB3)-coded\n            signals,\
    \ is the occurrence of a pulse of the same polarity\n            as the previous\
    \ pulse without being part of the zero\n            substitution code, B3ZS(HDB3).\
    \  For B3ZS(HDB3)-coded\n            signals, a bipolar violation error event\
    \ may also include\n            other error patterns such as:  three(four) or\
    \ more\n            consecutive zeros and incorrect polarity.\n          Excessive\
    \ Zeros (EXZ) Error Event\n            An EXZ is the occurrence of any zero string\

    \ period.  An EXZ\n            increments the LCV by one regardless of the length\n\
    \            of the zero string.\n          P-bit Coding Violation (PCV) Error\
    \ Event\n            For all DS3 applications, a coding violation error\n    \
    \        event is a P-bit\n            Parity Error event.  A P-bit Parity Error\
    \ event is the\n            occurrence of a received P-bit code on the DS3 M-frame\n\
    \            that is not identical to the corresponding locally-\n           \
    \ calculated code.\n          C-bit Coding Violation (CCV) Error Event\n     \
    \       For C-bit Parity and SYNTRAN DS3 applications, this is\n            the\
    \ count of coding violations reported via the C-bits.\n            For C-bit Parity,\
    \ it is a count of CP-bit parity errors\n            occurring in the accumulation\

    \ Seconds (UAS)\n            UAS are calculated by counting the number of seconds\
    \ that\n            the interface is unavailable.  The DS3 interface is said\n\
    \            to be unavailable from the onset of 10 contiguous PSESs, or\n   \
    \         the onset of the condition leading to a failure (see Failure\n     \
    \       States).  If the condition leading to the failure was\n            immediately\
    \ preceded by one or more contiguous PSESs, then\n            the DS3 interface\
    \ unavailability starts from the onset of\n            these PSESs.  Once unavailable,\
    \ and if no failure is\n            present, the DS3 interface becomes available\
    \ at the onset\n            of 10 contiguous seconds with no PSESs.  Once unavailable,\n\
    \            and if a failure is present, the DS3 interface becomes\n        \
    \    available at the onset of 10 contiguous seconds with no\n            PSESs,\
    \ if the failure clearing time is less than\n            or equal to 10 seconds.\
    \  If the failure clearing time is\n            more than 10 seconds, the DS3\
    \ interface becomes available\n            at the onset of 10 contiguous seconds\
    \ with no PSESs, or\n            the onset period leading to the successful clearing\n\
    \            condition, whichever occurs later.  With respect to the\n       \
    \     DS3 error counts, all counters are incremented\n            while the DS3\
    \ interface is deemed available.  While the\n            interface is deemed unavailable,\
    \ the only count that is\n            incremented is UASs.\n            A special\
    \ case exists when the 10 or more second period\n            crosses the 900 second\
    \ statistics window boundary, as the\n            foregoing description implies\
    \ that the PSES and UAS\n            counters must be adjusted when the Unavailable\
    \ Signal\n            State is entered. Clearly, successive GETs of the\n    \
    \        affected dsx3IntervalPSESs and dsx3IntervalUASs objects\n           \
    \ will return differing values if the first GET occurs\n            during the\
    \ first few seconds of the window.  This is\n            viewed as an unavoidable\
    \ side-effect of selecting the\n            presently defined managed objects\
    \ as a basis for this\n            memo.\n"

    \ Alarm Indication (RAI) failure, in SYNTRAN\n            applications, is declared\
    \ after detecting\n            the Yellow Alarm Signal on the alarm channel. \
    \ See ANSI\n            T1.107a-1990 [10].  The Remote Alarm Indication failure,\n\
    \            in C-bit Parity DS3 applications, is declared\n            as soon\
    \ as the preqsence of either one or two alarm signals\n            are detected\
    \ on then Far End Alarm Channel.  See [10].\n            The Remote Alarm Indication\
    \ failure may also be declared\n            after detecting the far-end SEF/AIS\
    \ defect (aka yellow).\n            The Remote Alarm Indication failure is cleared\
    \ as soon as\n            the presence of the any of the above alarms are removed.\n\
    \            Also, the incoming failure state is declared when a defect\n    \
    \        persists for at least 2-10 seconds.  The defects are\n            the\
    \ following:  Loss of Signal (LOS), an Out of Frame (OOF)\n            or an incoming\
    \ Alarm Indication Signal (AIS).\n            The Failure State is cleared when\
    \ the defect is absent\n            for less than or equal to 20 seconds.\n  \
    \        Far End SEF/AIS defect (aka yellow)\n            A Far End SEF/AIS defect\
    \ is the occurrence of the two X-bits\n            in a M-frame set to zero. \
    \ The Far End SEF/AIS defect is\n            terminated when the two X-bits in\
    \ a M-frame are set to\n            one.\n          Out of Frame (OOF) defect\n\
    \            A DS3 OOF defect is detected when any three or more errors\n    \
    \        in sixteen or fewer consecutive F-bits occur within a DS3\n         \
    \   M-frame.  An OOF defect may also be called a Severely\n            Errored\
    \ Frame (SEF) defect.  An OOF defect is cleared when\n            reframe occurs.\
    \  A DS3 Loss of Frame (LOF) failure is\n            declared when the DS3 OOF\
    \ defect is consistent for 2 to 10\n            seconds.  The DS3 OOF defect ends\
    \ when reframe occurs.\n            The DS3 LOF failure is cleared when the DS3\
    \ OOF\n            defect is absent for 10 to 20 seconds.\n            An E3 OOF\
    \ defect is detected when four consecutive frame\n            alignment signals\
    \ have been incorrectly received in there\n            predicted positions in\
    \ an E3 signal. E3 frame alignment\n            occurs when the presence of three\
    \ consecutive frame\n            alignment signals have been detected.\n     \
    \     Loss of Signal (LOS) defect\n            The DS3 LOS defect is declared\
    \ upon observing 175 +/- 75\n            contiguous pulse positions with no pulses\
    \ of either\n            positive or negative polarity.\n            The DS3 LOS\
    \ defect is terminated upon observing an average\n            pulse density of\
    \ at least 33% over a period of 175 +/- 75\n            contiguous pulse positions\
    \ starting with the receipt of a\n            pulse.\n          Alarm Indication\
    \ Signal (AIS) defect\n            The DS3 AIS is framed with \"stuck stuffing.\"\
    \  This implies\n            that it has a valid M-subframe alignments bits, M-frame\n\
    \            alignment bits, and P bits.  The information bits are set\n     \
    \       to a 1010... sequence, starting with a one (1) after each\n          \
    \  M-subframe alignment bit, M-frame alignment bit, X bit, P\n            bit,\
    \ and C bit.  The C bits are all set to zero giving\n            what is called\
    \ \"stuck stuffing.\"  The X bits are set to\n            one.  The DS3 AIS defect\
    \ is declared after DS3 AIS is\n            present in contiguous M-frames for\
    \ a time equal to or\n            greater than T, where 0.2 ms <= T <= 100 ms.\n\
    \            The DS3 AIS defect is terminated after AIS is absent in\n       \
    \     contiguous M-frames for a time equal to or greater than T.\n           \
    \ The E3 binary content of the AIS is nominally a continuous\n            stream\
    \ of ones.  AIS detection and the application of\n            consequent actions,\
    \ should be completed within a time\n            limit of 1 ms.\n"
