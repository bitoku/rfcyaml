  - "1.  Introduction\n   The objective of Pre-Congestion Notification (PCN) [RFC5559]\
    \ is to\n   protect the quality of service (QoS) of inelastic flows within a\n\
    \   Diffserv domain in a simple, scalable, and robust fashion.  Two\n   mechanisms\
    \ are used: admission control (AC), to decide whether to\n   admit or block a\
    \ new flow request, and flow termination (FT), to\n   terminate some existing\
    \ flows during serious pre-congestion.  To\n   achieve this, the overall rate\
    \ of PCN-traffic is metered on every\n   link in the domain, and PCN-packets are\
    \ appropriately marked when\n   certain configured rates are exceeded.  These\
    \ configured rates are\n   below the rate of the link.  Thus, boundary nodes are\
    \ notified of a\n   potential overload before any real congestion occurs (hence\
    \ \"pre-\n   congestion notification\").\n   [RFC5670] provides for two metering\
    \ and marking functions that are\n   configured with reference rates.  Threshold-marking\
    \ marks all PCN-\n   packets once their traffic rate on a link exceeds the configured\n\
    \   reference rate (PCN-threshold-rate).  Excess-traffic-marking marks\n   only\
    \ those PCN-packets that exceed the configured reference rate\n   (PCN-excess-rate).\n\
    \   Egress nodes monitor the PCN-marks of received PCN-packets and\n   provide\
    \ information about the PCN-marks to the decision points that\n   take decisions\
    \ about the flow admission and termination on this basis\n   [RFC6661] [RFC6662].\n\
    \   This PCN information has to be encoded into the IP header.  This\n   requires\
    \ at least three different codepoints: one for PCN-traffic\n   that has not been\
    \ marked, one for traffic that has been marked by the\n   threshold meter, and\
    \ one for traffic that has been marked by the\n   excess-traffic-meter.\n   Since\
    \ unused codepoints are not available for that purpose in the IP\n   header (versions\
    \ 4 and 6), already used codepoints must be reused,\n   which imposes additional\
    \ constraints on the design and applicability\n   of PCN-based AC and FT.  This\
    \ document summarizes these issues as a\n   record of the PCN working group discussions\
    \ and for the benefit of\n   the wider IETF community.\n   In Section 2, we briefly\
    \ point out the PCN encoding requirement\n   imposed by metering and marking algorithms,\
    \ and by special packet\n   drop strategies.  The Differentiated Services field\
    \ (6 bits -- see\n   [RFC3260] updating [RFC2474] in this respect) and the Explicit\n\
    \   Congestion Notification (ECN) field (2 bits) [RFC3168] have been\n   selected\
    \ to be reused for encoding of PCN-marks (PCN encoding).  In\n   Section 3, we\
    \ briefly explain the constraints imposed by this\n   decision.  In Section 4,\
    \ we review different PCN encodings considered\n   by the PCN working group that\
    \ allow different implementations of PCN-\n   based AC and FT, which have different\
    \ pros and cons.\n"

  - "2.  General PCN Encoding Requirements\n   The choice of metering and marking\
    \ algorithms and the way they are\n   applied to PCN-based AC and FT impose certain\
    \ requirements on PCN\n   encoding.\n"
- title: 2.1.  Metering and Marking Algorithms
  contents:
  - "2.1.  Metering and Marking Algorithms\n   Two different metering and marking\
    \ algorithms are defined in\n   [RFC5670]: excess-traffic-marking and threshold-marking.\
    \  They are\n   both configured with reference rates that are termed PCN-excess-rate\n\
    \   and PCN-threshold-rate, respectively.  When traffic for PCN-flows\n   enters\
    \ a PCN-domain, the PCN-ingress-node sets a codepoint in the IP\n   header indicating\
    \ that the packet is subject to PCN-metering and PCN-\n   marking and that it\
    \ is not-marked (NM).  The two metering and marking\n   algorithms possibly re-mark\
    \ PCN-packets as excess-traffic-marked\n   (ETM) or threshold-marked (ThM).\n\
    \   Excess-traffic-marking ETM-marks all not-ETM-marked PCN-traffic that\n   is\
    \ in excess of the PCN-excess-rate.  To that end, the algorithm\n   needs to know\
    \ whether a PCN-packet has already been marked with ETM\n   or not.  Threshold-marking\
    \ re-marks all not-marked PCN-traffic to ThM\n   when the rate of PCN-traffic\
    \ exceeds the PCN-threshold-rate.\n   Therefore, it does not need knowledge of\
    \ the prior marking state of\n   the packet for metering, but such knowledge is\
    \ needed for packet\n   re-marking.\n"

- title: 2.2.1.  Dual Marking (DM)
  contents:
  - "2.2.1.  Dual Marking (DM)\n   The intuitive approach for PCN-based AC and FT\
    \ requires that\n   threshold and excess-traffic-marking are simultaneously activated\
    \ on\n   all links of a PCN-domain, and their reference rates are configured\n\
    \   with the PCN-admissible-rate (AR) and the PCN-supportable-rate (SR),\n   respectively.\
    \  Threshold-marking meters all PCN-traffic, but re-marks\n   only NM-traffic\
    \ to ThM.  Excess-traffic-marking meters only NM- and\n   ThM-traffic and re-marks\
    \ it to ETM.  Thus, both meters and markers\n   need to identify PCN-packets and\
    \ their exact PCN codepoint.  We call\n   this marking behavior dual marking (DM)\
    \ and Figure 1 illustrates all\n   possible re-marking actions.\n           NM\

    \ Codepoint Re-Marking Diagram for Dual Marking (DM)\n   Dual marking is used\
    \ to support the Controlled-Load PCN (CL-PCN) edge\n   behavior [RFC6661].  We\
    \ briefly summarize the concept.  All actions\n   are performed on per-ingress-egress-aggregate\
    \ basis.  The egress node\n   measures the rate of NM-, ThM-, and ETM-traffic\
    \ in regular intervals\n   and sends them as PCN egress reports to the AC and\
    \ FT decision point.\n   If the proportion of re-marked (ThM- and ETM-) PCN-traffic\
    \ is larger\n   than a defined threshold, called CLE-limit, the decision point\
    \ blocks\n   new flow requests until new PCN egress reports are received;\n  \
    \ otherwise, it admits them.  With CL-PCN, AC is rather robust with\n   regard\
    \ to the value chosen for the CLE-limit.  FT works as follows.\n   If the ETM-traffic\
    \ rate is positive, the decision point triggers the\n   ingress node to send a\
    \ newly measured rate of the sent PCN-traffic.\n   The decision point calculates\
    \ the rate of PCN-traffic that needs to\n   be terminated by\n      termination-rate\
    \ = PCN-sent-rate -\n                            (rate-of-NM-traffic + rate-of-ThM-traffic)\n\
    \   and terminates an appropriate set of flows.  CL-PCN is accurate\n   enough\
    \ for most application scenarios and its implementation\n   complexity is acceptable,\
    \ therefore, it is a preferred implementation\n   option for PCN-based AC and\
    \ FT.\n"
- title: 2.2.2.  Single Marking (SM)
  contents:
  - "2.2.2.  Single Marking (SM)\n   Single marking uses only excess-traffic-marking\
    \ whose reference rate\n   is set to the PCN-admissible-rate (AR) on all links\
    \ of the PCN-\n   domain.  Figure 2 illustrates all possible re-marking actions.\n\
    \               NM --------> ETM\n     Figure 2: PCN Codepoint Re-Marking Diagram\
    \ for Single Marking (SM)\n   Single marking is used to support the Single-Marking\
    \ PCN (SM-PCN)\n   edge behavior [RFC6662].  We briefly summarize the concept.\n\
    \   AC works essentially in the same way as with CL-PCN, but AC is\n   sensitive\
    \ to the value of the CLE-limit.  Also FT works similarly to\n   CL-PCN.  The\
    \ PCN-supportable-rate (SR) is not configured on any link,\n   but is implicitly\n\
    \      SR=u*AR\n   in the PCN-domain using a network-wide constant u.  The decision\n\
    \   point triggers FT only if the rate-of-NM-traffic * u < rate-of-NM-\n   traffic\
    \ + rate-of-ETM-traffic.  Then it requests the PCN-sent-rate\n   from the corresponding\
    \ PCN-ingress-node and calculates the amount of\n   PCN-traffic to be terminated\
    \ by\n      termination-rate = PCN-sent-rate - rate-of-NM-traffic * u,\n   and\
    \ terminates an appropriate set of flows.\n   SM-PCN requires only two PCN codepoints\
    \ and only excess-traffic-\n   marking is needed, which means that it might be\
    \ earlier to the market\n   than CL-PCN since some chipsets do not yet support\
    \ threshold-marking.\n   However, it only works well when ingress-egress-aggregates\
    \ have a\n   high PCN-packet rate, which is not always the case.  Otherwise, over-\n\
    \   admission and over-termination may occur [Menth12] [Menth10].\n"
- title: 2.2.3.  Packet-Specific Dual Marking (PSDM)
  contents:
  - "2.2.3.  Packet-Specific Dual Marking (PSDM)\n   Packet-specific dual marking\
    \ (PSDM) uses threshold-marking and\n   excess-traffic-marking, whose reference\
    \ rates are configured with the\n   PCN-admissible-rate (AR) and the PCN-supportable-rate\
    \ (SR),\n   respectively.  There are two different types of not-marked packets:\n\
    \   those that are subject to threshold-marking (not-ThM), and those that\n  \
    \ are subject to excess-traffic-marking (not-ETM).  Both not-ThM and\n   not-ETM\
    \ are used for PCN-traffic that is not yet re-marked (like NM\n   with single\
    \ and dual marking), and their specific use is determined\n   by higher-layer\
    \ information (see below).  Threshold-marking meters\n   all PCN-traffic and re-marks\
    \ only not-ThM packets to PCN-marked (PM).\n   In contrast, excess-traffic-marking\
    \ meters only not-ETM packets and\n   possibly re-marks them to PM, too.  Again,\
    \ both meters and markers\n   need to identify PCN-packets and their exact PCN\

    \    Figure 3: PCN Codepoint Re-Marking Diagram for\n               Packet-Specific\
    \ Dual Marking (PSDM)\n     An edge behavior for PSDM has been presented in [Menth09]\
    \ and [PCN-\n     MS-AC].  We call it PSDM-PCN.  In contrast to CL-PCN and SM-PCN,\
    \ AC\n     is realized by reusing initial signaling messages for probing\n   \
    \  purposes.  The assumption is that admission requests are triggered\n     by\
    \ an external end-to-end signaling protocol, e.g., RSVP [RFC2205].\n     Signaling\
    \ traffic for a flow is also labeled as PCN-traffic, and if\n     an initial signaling\
    \ message traverses the PCN-domain and is\n     re-marked, then the corresponding\
    \ admission request is blocked.\n     This is a lightweight probing mechanism\
    \ that does not generate\n     extra traffic and does not introduce probing delay.\
    \  In PSDM-PCN,\n     PCN-ingress-nodes label initial signaling messages as not-ThM,\
    \ and\n     threshold-marking configured with admissible rates possibly\n    \
    \ re-marks them to PM.  Data packets are labeled with not-ETM, and\n     excess-traffic-marking\
    \ configured with supportable rates possibly\n     re-marks them to PM, too, so\
    \ that the same algorithms for FT may be\n     used as for CL-PCN and SM-PCN.\n\
    \     PSDM has three major disadvantages.  First, signalling traffic\n     needs\
    \ to be marked with a PCN-enabled DSCP so that it either shares\n     the same\
    \ queue as data traffic, which may not be desired by some\n     operators, or\
    \ multiple PCN-enabled DSCPs are needed, which is not a\n     pragmatic solution.\
    \  Second, reservations for PCN-flows need to be\n     triggered by a path-coupled\
    \ end-to-end signalling protocol, which\n     restricts the choice of the signalling\
    \ protocol.  And third, the\n     selected signalling protocols must be adapted\
    \ to take advantage of\n     PCN-marked signalling messages for admission decisions,\
    \ which\n     incurs some extra effort before PSDM can be used.\n     The advantages\
    \ are that the AC algorithm is more accurate than the\n     one of CL-PCN and\
    \ SM-PCN [Menth12], that often only a single DSCP\n     is needed, and that the\
    \ new tunneling rules in [RFC6040] are not\n     needed for deployment (Section\
    \ 3.3.3).\n"

  contents:
  - "2.2.4.  Preferential Packet Dropping\n     The termination algorithms described\
    \ in [RFC6661] and [RFC6662]\n     require the preferential dropping of ETM-marked\
    \ packets to avoid\n     over-termination in the case of packet loss.  An analysis\n\
    \     explaining this phenomenon can be found in Section 4 of [Menth10].\n   \
    \  Thus, [RFC5670] recommends that ETM-marked packets \"SHOULD be\n     preferentially\

- title: 3.2.2.  Handling of the DSCP in Tunneling Rules
  contents:
  - "3.2.2.  Handling of the DSCP in Tunneling Rules\n   PCN encoding must be chosen\
    \ in such a way that PCN-traffic can be\n   tunneled within a PCN-domain without\
    \ any impact on PCN-metering and\n   re-marking.  In the following, the \"inner\
    \ header\" refers to the\n   header of the encapsulated packet and the \"outer\
    \ header\" refers to\n   the encapsulating header.\n   [RFC2983] provides two\

    \ technique is needed to restore\n   the original DSCP.  A few possibilities are\
    \ discussed:\n   1.  Each Diffserv class using PCN uses a different set of DSCPs.\n\
    \       Therefore, if there are M DSCPs using PCN and PCN encoding uses N\n  \
    \     different DSCPs, N*M DSCPs are needed.  This solution may work\n       well\

    \ due to the extreme shortage of\n       available DSCPs.\n   2.  The original\

    \ PCN-domain.  The pipe-\n       tunneling model is applied, so the original DSCP\
    \ is restored\n       after decapsulation.  However, tunneling across a PCN-domain\
    \ adds\n       an additional IP header and reduces the maximum transfer unit\n\

    \   using pseudowires are potential solutions that scale well in\n       backbone\

    \   According to Section 3.3.3, tunneling ECN traffic through a PCN-\n   domain\
    \ may help to implement (A).  When (B) applies, CE-marked\n   packets must never\

    \ specified in [RFC5696].\n   The reasoning is as follows.  During the early life\
    \ of the working\n   group, the working group decided on an approach of a standardized\n\
    \   \"baseline\" encoding [RFC5696], plus a series of experimental\n   encodings\
    \ that would all build on the baseline encoding, each of\n   which would be useful\
    \ in specific circumstances.  However, after the\n   tunneling of ECN was standardized\
    \ in [RFC6040], the PCN working group\n   decided on a different approach -- to\
    \ recommend just one encoding,\n   the \"3-in-1 encoding\".\n   Although in theory\
    \ \"3-in-1\" could be specified as a Standards Track\n   extension to the \"baseline\"\
    \ encoding, the working group decided that\n   it would be cleaner to obsolete\
    \ [RFC5696] and specify \"3-in-1\"\n   encoding in a new, stand-alone RFC.\n"
