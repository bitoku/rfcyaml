- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   Today, the RFC 3484 [RFC3484] mechanism is widely implemented\
    \ in\n   major OSs.  However, in many sites, the default address-selection\n \
    \  rules are not appropriate, and cause a communication failure.  The\n   problem\
    \ statement (PS) document [RFC5220] lists problematic cases\n   that resulted\
    \ from incorrect address selection.\n   Though RFC 3484 made the address-selection\
    \ behavior of a host\n   configurable, typical users cannot make use of that because\
    \ of the\n   complexity of the mechanism and lack of knowledge about their network\n\
    \   topologies.  Therefore, an address-selection autoconfiguration\n   mechanism\
    \ is necessary, especially for unmanaged hosts of typical\n   users.\n   This\
    \ document contains requirements for address-selection mechanisms\n   that enable\
    \ hosts to perform appropriate address selection\n   automatically.\n"
- title: 2.  Requirements of Address Selection
  contents:
  - "2.  Requirements of Address Selection\n   Address-selection mechanisms have to\
    \ fulfill the following eleven\n   requirements.\n"
- title: 2.1.  Effectiveness
  contents:
  - "2.1.  Effectiveness\n   The mechanism can modify RFC 3484 default address-selection\
    \ behavior\n   at nodes.  As documented in the PS [RFC5220], the default rules\n\
    \   defined in RFC 3484 do not work properly in some environments.\n   Therefore,\
    \ the mechanism has to be able to modify the address-\n   selection behavior of\
    \ a host and to solve the problematic cases\n   described in the PS document.\n"
- title: 2.2.  Timing
  contents:
  - "2.2.  Timing\n   Nodes can perform appropriate address selection when they select\n\
    \   addresses.\n   If nodes need to have address-selection information to perform\n\
    \   appropriate address selection, then the mechanism has to provide a\n   function\
    \ for nodes to obtain the necessary information beforehand.\n   The mechanism\
    \ should not degrade usability.  The mechanism should not\n   enforce long address-selection\
    \ processing time upon users.\n   Therefore, forcing every consumer user to manipulate\
    \ the address-\n   selection policy table is usually not an acceptable solution.\
    \  So, in\n   this case, some kind of autoconfiguration mechanism is desirable.\n"
- title: 2.3.  Dynamic Behavior Update
  contents:
  - "2.3.  Dynamic Behavior Update\n   The address-selection behavior of nodes can\
    \ be dynamically updated.\n   When the network structure changes and the address-selection\
    \ behavior\n   has to be changed accordingly, a network administrator can modify\
    \ the\n   address-selection behavior of nodes.\n"
- title: 2.4.  Node-Specific Behavior
  contents:
  - "2.4.  Node-Specific Behavior\n   The mechanism can support node-specific address-selection\
    \ behavior.\n   Even when multiple nodes are on the same subnet, the mechanism\
    \ should\n   be able to provide a method for the network administrator to make\n\
    \   nodes behave differently.  For example, each node may have a\n   different\
    \ set of assigned prefixes.  In such a case, the appropriate\n   address-selection\
    \ behavior may be different.\n"
- title: 2.5.  Application-Specific Behavior
  contents:
  - "2.5.  Application-Specific Behavior\n   The mechanism can support application-specific\
    \ address-selection\n   behavior or combined use with an application-specific\
    \ address-\n   selection mechanism such as address-selection APIs.\n"
- title: 2.6.  Multiple Interface
  contents:
  - "2.6.  Multiple Interface\n   The mechanism can support those nodes equipped with\
    \ multiple\n   interfaces.  The mechanism has to assume that nodes have multiple\n\
    \   interfaces and makes address selection of those nodes work\n   appropriately.\n"
- title: 2.7.  Central Control
  contents:
  - "2.7.  Central Control\n   The address-selection behavior of nodes can be centrally\
    \ controlled.\n   A site administrator or a service provider could determine or\
    \ could\n   have an effect on the address-selection behavior at their users'\n\
    \   hosts.\n"
- title: 2.8.  Next-Hop Selection
  contents:
  - "2.8.  Next-Hop Selection\n   The mechanism can control next-hop-selection behavior\
    \ at hosts or\n   cooperate with other routing mechanisms, such as routing protocols\n\
    \   and RFC 4191 [RFC4191].  If the address-selection mechanism is used\n   with\
    \ a routing mechanism, the two mechanisms have to be able to work\n   synchronously.\n"
- title: 2.9.  Compatibility with RFC 3493
  contents:
  - "2.9.  Compatibility with RFC 3493\n   The mechanism can allow an application\
    \ that uses the basic socket\n   interface defined in RFC 3493 [RFC3493] to work\
    \ correctly.  That is,\n   with the basic socket interface the application can\
    \ select\n   appropriate source and destination addresses and can communicate\
    \ with\n   the destination host.  This requirement does not necessarily mean\n\
    \   that OS protocol stack and socket libraries should not be changed.\n"
- title: 2.10.  Compatibility and Interoperability with RFC 3484
  contents:
  - "2.10.  Compatibility and Interoperability with RFC 3484\n   The mechanism is\
    \ compatible with RFC 3484.  Now that RFC 3484 is\n   widely implemented, it is\
    \ preferable that a new address selection\n   mechanism does not conflict with\
    \ the address selection mechanisms\n   defined in RFC 3484.\n   If the solution\
    \ mechanism changes or replaces the address-selection\n   mechanism defined in\
    \ RFC 3484, interoperability has to be retained.\n   That is, a host with the\
    \ new solution mechanism and a host with the\n   mechanism of RFC 3484 have to\
    \ be interoperable.\n"
- title: 2.11.  Security
  contents:
  - "2.11.  Security\n   The mechanism works without any security problems.  Possible\
    \ security\n   threats are described in the Security Considerations section of\
    \ this\n   document.\n"

- title: 3.1.  List of Threats Introduced by New Address-Selection Mechanism
  contents:
  - "3.1.  List of Threats Introduced by New Address-Selection Mechanism\n   There\
    \ will be some security incidents when combining the requirements\n   described\
    \ in Section 2 into a protocol.  In particular, there are 3\n   types of threats:\
    \ leakage, hijacking, and denial of service.\n   1.  Leakage: Malicious nodes\
    \ may tap to collect the network policy\n       information and leak it to unauthorized\
    \ parties.\n   2.  Hijacking: Nodes may be hijacked by malicious injection of\n\
    \       illegitimate policy information.  RFC 3484 defines both a source\n   \
    \    and destination selection algorithm.  An attacker able to inject\n      \
    \ malicious policy information could redirect packets sent by a\n       victim\
    \ node to an intentionally chosen server that would scan the\n       victim node\
    \ activities to find vulnerable code.  Once vulnerable\n       code is found,\
    \ the attacker can take control of the victim node.\n   3.  Denial of Service:\
    \ This is an attack on the ability of nodes to\n       communicate in the absence\
    \ of the address-selection policy.  An\n       attacker could launch a flooding\
    \ attack on the controller to\n       prevent it from delivering the address selection\
    \ policy\n       information to nodes, thus preventing those nodes from\n    \
    \   appropriately communicating.\n"
- title: 3.2.  List of Recommendations in Which Security Mechanism Should Be
  contents:
  - "3.2.  List of Recommendations in Which Security Mechanism Should Be\n      Applied\n\
    \   The address selection mechanism should be afforded security services\n   listed\
    \ below.  It is preferable that these security services are\n   afforded via use\
    \ of existing protocols (e.g., IPsec).\n   1.  Integrity of the network policy\
    \ information itself and the\n       messages exchanged in the protocol.  This\
    \ is a countermeasure\n       against leakage, hijacking, and denial of service.\n\
    \   2.  Authentication and authorization of parties involved in the\n       protocol.\
    \  This is a countermeasure against Leakage and\n       Hijacking.\n"
