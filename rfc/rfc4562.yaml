  - "1.  Introduction\n   The main purpose of an access network is to provide connectivity\n\
    \   between customer hosts and service provider access routers (ARs),\n   typically\
    \ offering reachability to the Internet and other IP networks\n   and/or IP-based\
    \ applications.\n   An access network may be decomposed into a subscriber line\
    \ part and\n   an aggregation network part.  The subscriber line - often referred\
    \ to\n   as \"the first mile\" - is characterized by an individual physical (or\n\
    \   logical, in the case of some wireless technologies) connection to\n   each\
    \ customer premises.  The aggregation network - \"the second mile\"\n   - performs\
    \ aggregation and concentration of customer traffic.\n   The subscriber line and\
    \ the aggregation network are interconnected by\n   an Access Node (AN).  Thus,\
    \ the AN constitutes the border between\n   individual subscriber lines and the\
    \ common aggregation network.  This\n   is illustrated in the following figure.\n\

- title: 1.1.  Access Network Requirements
  contents:
  - "1.1.  Access Network Requirements\n   There are two basic requirements that an\
    \ access network solution must\n   satisfy:\n   1. Layer-2 separation between\
    \ customer premises.\n   2. High IPv4 address assignment efficiency.\n   It is\
    \ required that all traffic to and from customer hosts located at\n   different\
    \ premises (i.e., accessed via different subscriber lines or\n   via different\
    \ access networks) be forwarded via an AR, and not\n   bridged or switched at\
    \ layer-2 (Requirement 1; see also requirement\n   R-40 in [TR101]).  This enables\
    \ the access network service provider\n   to use the AR(s) to perform security\
    \ filtering, policing, and\n   accounting of all customer traffic.  This implies\
    \ that within the\n   access network, layer-2 traffic paths should not exist that\n\
    \   circumvent an AR (with some exceptions; see Section 3.4).\n   In ATM-based\
    \ access networks, the separation of individual customer\n   hosts' traffic is\
    \ an intrinsic feature achieved by the use of ATM\n   permanent virtual connections\
    \ (PVCs) between the customers' access\n   device (e.g., DSL modem) and the AR\
    \ (typically co-located/integrated\n   with access control functionality in a\
    \ Broadband Remote Access Server\n   (BRAS)).  In this case, the AN is an ATM-based\
    \ Digital Subscriber\n   Line Access Multiplexer (DSLAM).\n   This document, however,\
    \ targets Ethernet-based access networks.\n   Techniques other than ATM PVCs must\
    \ be employed to ensure the desired\n   separation of traffic to and from individual\
    \ customer hosts.\n   Efficient address assignment is necessary to minimize consumption\
    \ of\n   the scarce IPv4 address space (Requirement 2).  See [RFC3069] for\n \
    \  further discussion.  Address assignment efficiency is improved if\n   host\
    \ addresses are assigned out of one or more large pools, rather\n   than by being\
    \ assigned out of separate, smaller subnet blocks\n   allocated to each customer\
    \ premises.  IPv6 address assignment\n   efficiency is of much less concern, and\
    \ it is anticipated that IPv6\n   deployments will allocate separate IPv6 subnet\
    \ blocks to each\n   customer premises [v6BB].\n"
- title: 1.2.  Using Ethernet as an Access Network Technology
  contents:
  - "1.2.  Using Ethernet as an Access Network Technology\n   A major aspect of using\
    \ Ethernet as an access technology is that\n   traffic pertaining to different\
    \ customer hosts is conveyed over a\n   shared broadcast network.  Layer-2 isolation\
    \ between customer\n   premises networks could be provided by implementing access\
    \ router\n   functionality in each EAN, treating each subscriber line as a\n \
    \  separate IP interface.  However, there are a variety of reasons why\n   it\
    \ is often desirable to avoid IP routing in the access network,\n   including\
    \ the need to satisfy regulatory requirements for direct\n   layer-2 accessibility\
    \ to multiple IP service providers.  In addition,\n   this solution would not\
    \ solve Requirement 2.\n   To avoid IP routing within the access network, the\
    \ Ethernet\n   aggregation network is bridged via EANs to individual Ethernet\n\
    \   networks at the customers' premises.  If the EANs were standard\n   Ethernet\
    \ bridges, then there would be direct layer-2 visibility\n   between Ethernet\
    \ stations (hosts) located at different customers'\n   premises.  Specifically,\
    \ hosts located within the same IP subnet\n   would have this visibility.  This\
    \ violates Requirement 1 (Section\n   1.1) and introduces security issues, as\
    \ malicious end-users thereby\n   can attack hosts at other customers' premises\
    \ directly at the\n   Ethernet layer.\n   Existing standardized solutions may\
    \ be deployed to prevent layer-2\n   visibility between stations:\n   o  PPP over\
    \ Ethernet [RFC2516].  The use of PPPoE creates individual\n      PPP sessions\
    \ between hosts and one or more BRASes over a bridged\n      Ethernet topology.\
    \  Traffic always flows between a BRAS and hosts,\n      never directly between\
    \ hosts.  The AN can force upstream traffic\n      to flow only to the BRAS initially\
    \ selected by the host.\n   o  VLAN per-customer premises network [RFC3069]. \
    \ Traffic to/from\n      each customer premises network can be separated into\
    \ different\n      VLANs across the aggregation network between the AN and the\
    \ AR.\n   Both solutions provide layer-2 isolation between customer hosts, but\n\
    \   they are not considered optimal for broadband access networks,\n   because:\n\
    \   o  PPPoE does not support efficient multicast: packets must be\n      replicated\
    \ on each PPPoE session to hosts listening on a specific\n      multicast group.\
    \  This negates one of the major advantages of\n      using Ethernet (instead\
    \ of ATM) as an access technology.  This is\n      an especially problematic limitation\
    \ for services such as IPTV,\n      which require high bandwidth per-multicast\
    \ group (channel), and\n      which may often have hundreds or thousands of listening\
    \ customer\n      hosts per group.\n   o  Using VLANs to isolate individual customer\
    \ premises networks also\n      forces multicast packets to be replicated to each\
    \ VLAN with a\n      listening host.  Furthermore, the basic limit of a maximum\
    \ of 4096\n      VLANs per-Ethernet network limits the scalability of the solution.\n\
    \      This scalability limit can be removed by deploying VLAN stacking\n    \
    \  techniques within the access network, but this approach increases\n      provisioning\
    \ complexity.\n   The solution proposed in this document avoids these problems.\n"

    \  to an AR.\n"
- title: 3.  Solution Aspects
  contents:
  - "3.  Solution Aspects\n   The basic property of the solution is that the EAN ensures\
    \ that\n   upstream traffic is always sent to a designated AR, even if the IP\n\
    \   traffic should ultimately flow between customer hosts located within\n   the\
    \ same IP subnet.\n   The solution has three major aspects:\n   1. Initially,\
    \ the EAN obtains the IP and MAC addresses of the allowed\n      target ARs for\
    \ each customer host.\n   2. The EAN replies to any upstream ARP request [RFC0826]\
    \ from\n      customer hosts with the MAC address of an allowed target AR.\n \
    \  3. The EAN discards any upstream unicast traffic to MAC addresses\n      other\
    \ than the allowed target ARs.  The EAN also discards all\n      non-essential\
    \ broadcast and multicast packets received on\n      subscriber lines.\n   These\
    \ aspects are discussed in the following sections.\n"
- title: 3.1.  Obtaining the IP and MAC Addresses of the Access Routers
  contents:
  - "3.1.  Obtaining the IP and MAC Addresses of the Access Routers\n   An access\
    \ network may contain multiple ARs, and different hosts may\n   be assigned to\
    \ different (groups of) ARs.  This implies that the EAN\n   must register the\
    \ assigned AR addresses on a per-customer host basis.\n   For each customer host,\
    \ one of the ARs is acting as the default\n   gateway.  If a customer has simultaneous\
    \ access to multiple ARs, the\n   other ARs typically will provide access to other\
    \ IP networks.\n   The EAN learns the IPv4 address of the allowed target ARs in\
    \ one of\n   two ways, depending on the host IPv4 address assignment method. \
    \ For\n   each host using Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP), the EAN\n\
    \   learns the AR IPv4 addresses dynamically by snooping the DHCPACK\n   reply\
    \ to a host [RFC2131].  If a host using DHCP shall have\n   simultaneous access\
    \ to multiple ARs, DHCP option 121 [RFC3442] or\n   DHCP option 33 [RFC2132] must\
    \ be used to specify them for that host.\n   If static address assignment is used\
    \ instead of DHCP, then AR IPv4\n   addresses must be pre-provisioned in the EAN\
    \ by the network operator.\n   In both cases, the EAN will ARP to determine the\
    \ ARs' corresponding\n   MAC addresses.  This can be done immediately after the\
    \ IPv4 addresses\n   are learned or when the MAC addresses are first required.\n\
    \   The DHCP server can associate customer hosts with subscriber lines if\n  \
    \ the EAN uses the DHCP Relay Agent Information Option (82) to convey a\n   subscriber\
    \ line identifier to the DHCP server in DHCP messages\n   flowing upstream from\
    \ the customer host [RFC3046].\n"
- title: 3.2.  Responding to ARP Requests
  contents:
  - "3.2.  Responding to ARP Requests\n   If all customer networks were assigned individual\
    \ IP subnet blocks\n   (and if routing protocols were blocked inside the access\
    \ network),\n   then all upstream traffic would normally go to an AR (typically\
    \ the\n   default gateway), and the EAN could validate all upstream traffic by\n\
    \   checking that the destination MAC address matched that of an AR.\n   However,\
    \ to comply with Requirement 2 of Section 1.1, residential\n   customer networks\
    \ are not (usually) assigned individual IPv4 subnet\n   blocks.  In other words,\
    \ several hosts located at different premises\n   are within the same IPv4 subnet.\
    \  Consequently, if a host wishes to\n   communicate with a host at another premises,\
    \ an ARP request is issued\n   to obtain that host's corresponding MAC address.\
    \  This request is\n   intercepted by the EAN's ARP proxy, and an ARP reply is\
    \ sent,\n   specifying an allowed AR MAC address (typically the default\n   gateway's)\
    \ as the requested layer-2 destination address, in a manner\n   similar to the\
    \ \"proxy ARP\" mechanism described in [RFC1812].  In this\n   way, the ARP table\
    \ of the requesting host will register an AR MAC\n   address as the layer-2 destination\
    \ for any host within that IPv4\n   subnet (except those at the same customer\
    \ premises; see below).\n   ARP requests for an IPv4 address of an allowed target\
    \ AR are replied\n   to by the EAN's ARP proxy with that AR's MAC address, rather\
    \ than the\n   MAC address of the default gateway AR.\n   An exception is made\
    \ when a host is ARPing for another host located\n   within the same premises\
    \ network.  If this ARP request reaches the\n   EAN, it should be discarded, because\
    \ it is assumed to be answered\n   directly by the target host within the premises\
    \ network.  The EAN\n   must keep track of all assigned IPv4 addresses on a subscriber\
    \ line\n   so that it can detect these ARP requests and discard them.\n"
- title: 3.3.  Filtering Upstream Traffic
  contents:
  - "3.3.  Filtering Upstream Traffic\n   Since the EAN's ARP proxy will always reply\
    \ with the MAC address of\n   an AR, the requesting host will never learn MAC\
    \ addresses of hosts\n   located at other premises.  However, malicious customers\
    \ or\n   malfunctioning hosts may still try to send traffic using other\n   unicast\
    \ destination MAC addresses.  The EAN must discard all unicast\n   frames received\
    \ on a subscriber line that are not addressed to a\n   destination MAC address\
    \ for an allowed AR (with some exceptions; see\n   Section 3.4.\n   Similarly,\
    \ broadcast or multicast packets received on a subscriber\n   line must never\
    \ be forwarded on other subscriber lines, but only on\n   EAN uplinks to the aggregation\
    \ network.  An EAN must discard all\n   non-ARP broadcast packets received on\
    \ subscriber lines, except when\n   DHCP is in use, in which case, the EAN must\
    \ forward client-to-server\n   DHCP broadcast messages (DHCPDISCOVER, DHCPREQUEST,\
    \ DHCPDECLINE,\n   DHCPINFORM) [RFC2131] upstream.  An EAN should rate limit upstream\n\
    \   broadcast packets.\n   Broadcast packets forwarded on an EAN uplink may be\
    \ forwarded to\n   other EANs by the aggregation network.  EANs should discard\
    \ all\n   broadcast packets received from the aggregation network, except ARPs\n\
    \   from ARs for subscriber hosts and server-to-client DHCP messages\n   (DHCPOFFER,\
    \ DHCPACK, DHCPNAK) [RFC2131], when DHCP is in use.\n   Filtering of multicast\
    \ packets to and from an EAN uplink is discussed\n   in Section 6.\n"

  - "3.4.  Restricted Access to Application Servers\n   The previous discussion (Section\
    \ 3.1) describes how customer hosts\n   are allowed direct layer-2 connectivity\
    \ only to one or more ARs.\n   Similarly, a customer host could be allowed direct\
    \ layer-2 access to\n   one or more Application Servers (ASes) which are directly\
    \ connected\n   to the aggregation network.  There is no functional difference\

  - "4.  Access Router Considerations\n   Traffic between customer hosts that belong\

    \   to the originating network, i.e., on the same interface from where it\n  \
    \ was received.  This normally results in an ICMP redirect message\n   [RFC0792]\
    \ being sent to the originating host.  To prevent this\n   behavior, the ICMP\
    \ redirect function for aggregation network\n   interfaces must be disabled in\
    \ the AR.\n"
- title: 5.  Resiliency Considerations
  contents:
  - "5.  Resiliency Considerations\n   The operation of MAC-Forced Forwarding does\
    \ not interfere with or\n   delay IP connectivity recovery in the event of a sustained\
    \ AR\n   failure.  Use of DHCP to configure hosts with information on\n   multiple,\
    \ redundant ARs, or use of Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol\n   (VRRP) [RFC3768]\
    \ to implement AR redundancy, allows IP connectivity\n   to be maintained.\n \
    \  MAC-Forced Forwarding is a stateful protocol.  If static IPv4 address\n   assignment\
    \ is used in the access network, then the EAN must be pre-\n   provisioned with\
    \ state information for the customer hosts which may\n   be reached via a subscriber\
    \ line, and the ARs associated with those\n   hosts.  In the event of a transient\
    \ EAN failure, the EAN's state\n   database can be quickly recovered from its\
    \ configuration storage.\n   If DHCP is used to assign IPv4 addresses in the access\
    \ network, then\n   MAC-Forced Forwarding operates as a soft-state protocol. \
    \ Since the\n   DHCP and ARP messages that are snooped to construct the EAN state\n\
    \   database are usually sent infrequently, a transient failure may not\n   be\
    \ detected by either the AR(s) or the customer hosts.  Therefore, a\n   transient\
    \ failure of an EAN could lead to an extended loss of\n   connectivity.  To minimize\
    \ connectivity loss, an EAN should maintain\n   its dynamic state database in\
    \ resilient storage to permit timely\n   database and connectivity restoration.\n\
    \   The EAN is a single point of attachment between a subscriber line and\n  \
    \ the aggregation network; hence, the EAN is a single point of\n   connectivity\
    \ failure.  Customers seeking more resilient connectivity\n   should multi-home.\n"

  - "6.  Multicast Considerations\n   Multicast traffic delivery for streams originating\
    \ within the\n   aggregation network or further upstream and delivered to one\

    \   by virtue of Ethernet's native multicast capability.  Bandwidth\n   efficiency\
    \ can be enhanced if the EAN behaves as an IGMP snooping\n   bridge; e.g., if\

  contents:
  - "7.  IPv6 Considerations\n   MAC-Forced Forwarding is not directly applicable\
    \ for IPv6 access\n   networks for the following reasons:\n   1. IPv6 access networks\
    \ do not require the same efficiency of address\n      allocation as IPv4 access\
    \ networks.  It is expected that customer\n      premises networks will be allocated\

    \ must learn the IPv6 and MAC addresses of\n   the allowed ARs for a particular\
    \ subscriber line.  It can learn these\n   addresses either through static configuration\
    \ or by snooping Router\n   Discovery messages exchanged between the customer\
    \ premises router and\n   one or more ARs [RFC2461].\n   Multicast is an intrinsic\
    \ part of the IPv6 protocol suite.\n   Therefore, an EAN must not indiscriminately\
    \ filter IPv6 multicast\n   packets flowing upstream, although it may rate limit\
    \ them.  Detailed\n   IPv6 multicast filtering rules are not discussed in this\
    \ document.\n"

  - "8.  Security Considerations\n   MAC-Forced Forwarding is, by its nature, a security\
    \ function,\n   ensuring layer-2 isolation of customer hosts sharing a broadcast\n\
    \   access medium.  In that sense, it provides security equivalent to\n   alternative\
    \ PVC-based solutions.  Security procedures appropriate for\n   any shared access\
    \ medium are equally appropriate when MAC-Forced\n   Forwarding is employed. \
    \ It does not introduce any additional\n   vulnerabilities over those of standard\
    \ Ethernet bridging.\n   In addition to layer-2 isolation, an EAN implementing\
    \ MAC-Forced\n   Forwarding must discard all upstream broadcast packets, except\
    \ for\n   valid DHCP messages, and ARP requests (which are proxied by the EAN).\n\
    \   In particular, the EAN must discard any DHCP server replies\n   originating\
    \ on a subscriber line.  Further, an EAN may rate limit\n   upstream broadcast\
    \ DHCP messages.\n   An EAN implementing MAC-Forced Forwarding must keep track\
    \ of IPv4\n   addresses allocated on subscriber lines.  Therefore, the EAN has\n\
    \   sufficient information to discard upstream traffic with spoofed IPv4\n   source\
    \ addresses.\n"
