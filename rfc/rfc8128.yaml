  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   The ICANN Root Zone Evolution Review Committee (RZERC) reviews\n\
    \   proposed architectural changes to the content of the DNS root zone,\n   the\
    \ systems including both hardware and software components used in\n   executing\
    \ changes to the DNS root zone, and the mechanisms used for\n   distribution of\
    \ the DNS root zone, and makes recommendations to the\n   ICANN Board.  As stipulated\
    \ in [RZERC-Charter], the IETF is called\n   upon to name its delegate to the\
    \ committee.\n   The IAB will select one person for a one-year term.  This appointment\n\
    \   can be renewed for up to three additional one-year terms.  This memo\n   outlines\
    \ the process by which the IETF makes that selection.\n   In brief, this document\
    \ describes the timeframe and procedures for\n   the IAB to solicit public input\
    \ and make a selection for the open\n   position.\n"
- title: 2.  Desirable Qualifications for an IETF-Nominated RZERC Member
  contents:
  - "2.  Desirable Qualifications for an IETF-Nominated RZERC Member\n   Candidates\
    \ for the RZERC should have a demonstrable involvement in\n   the IETF with a\
    \ particular focus on active participation in IETF\n   Working Groups.\n   The\
    \ candidate is expected to possess clearly demonstrated technical\n   competence\
    \ in Internet technology relating to the DNS root zone and\n   be able to articulate\
    \ those technology issues such that the ICANN\n   Board can be provided with sound\
    \ technical perspectives.  The\n   candidate is also expected to be able to understand\
    \ the respective\n   roles and responsibilities of the IETF and ICANN and be able\
    \ to\n   articulate these roles within both organizational communities.\n   The\
    \ candidate will be a representative or a delegate of the IETF.  It\n   is expected\
    \ that the candidate would be able to call on experts in\n   the IETF community\
    \ as required, to ensure that the ICANN Board\n   receives the highest-quality\
    \ technical advice available.\n"

- title: 3.1.  Term Length
  contents:
  - "3.1.  Term Length\n   The IETF appointment to the RZERC will serve a one-year\
    \ term.  This\n   appointment can be renewed for up to three additional one-year\
    \ terms.\n   In cases when the incumbent is willing to serve for an additional\n\
    \   term and has not yet exceeded the term limits described above, the\n   IAB\
    \ may ask the IETF community for feedback on the incumbent to find\n   out whether\
    \ it is necessary to run a full selection process.  If the\n   IAB determines\
    \ that it is not necessary to run a full selection\n   process, the incumbent\
    \ may be reappointed by the IAB for another\n   year.\n"
- title: 3.2.  Nominations and Eligibility
  contents:
  - "3.2.  Nominations and Eligibility\n   Except in cases when the IAB has decided\
    \ to reappoint the incumbent,\n   each year, the IAB will make a public call for\
    \ nominations on the\n   IETF Announce <ietf-announce@ietf.org> mailing list.\
    \  The public call\n   will specify the manner by which nominations will be accepted\
    \ and the\n   means by which the list of nominees will be published.  The call\
    \ for\n   nominations will also include the expected workload for the position,\n\
    \   as provided by the current IETF-appointed RZERC member.\n   Self-nominations\
    \ are permitted.  Along with the name and contact\n   information for each candidate,\
    \ details about the candidate's\n   background and qualifications for the position\
    \ should be attached to\n   the nomination.  All IETF participants are eligible\
    \ for nomination.\n   While IETF NomCom members, IAB members, IAOC members, and\
    \ IESG\n   members are eligible, the IAB will balance time constraints and\n \
    \  potential conflicts of interest from those members in its\n   consideration\
    \ of nominees.\n   IAB members who accept a nomination will recuse themselves\
    \ from\n   selection discussions.\n"
- title: 3.3.  Selection
  contents:
  - "3.3.  Selection\n   The IAB will publish the list of nominated persons, review\
    \ the\n   material, and make a selection.\n   The IAB will consider potential\
    \ conflicts with a position on the\n   ICANN RZERC and any other ICANN committees\
    \ supported by nominated\n   candidates.\n"
- title: 3.4.  Timeframe
  contents:
  - "3.4.  Timeframe\n   The IAB expects to seat new RZERC members in time for ICANN's\
    \ annual\n   general meeting in Q4 of each year.  Basic timeframe requirements\
    \ for\n   the IETF process are as follows:\n   o  4-6 weeks for solicitation of\
    \ nominations or review of incumbent\n   o  4-6 weeks for review of nominees,\
    \ deliberation, and selection\n   In Q2 of each year, the IAB will announce the\
    \ specific dates for the\n   RZERC selection process for that year (taking into\
    \ account the\n   particular dates of IETF and ICANN meetings, etc.) following\
    \ the\n   guidelines above.\n"

  - "3.5.  Mid-term Vacancies\n   This document describes the process for the general,\
    \ annual\n   appointment of RZERC members to fill the seats of members whose terms\n\
    \   are ending.  However, if an IETF-appointed member of the RZERC is\n   unable\
    \ to serve his or her full term, the IAB may, at its discretion,\n   immediately\
    \ select a replacement to serve the remainder of the term\n   using the interim\
    \ process defined in Section 3.5.1.  If the IAB does\n   not invoke the interim\
    \ process, the next annual selection process\n   will fill the vacancy.\n"
- title: 3.5.1.  Interim Appointment Process
  contents:
  - "3.5.1.  Interim Appointment Process\n   If the IAB elects to fill the mid-term\
