    \ by Dave Wa\n    p. 11 \"The IMP program can handle up to 63 active transmit\
    \ links\n    and 63 active receive links at a time.  If the Host attempts to\n\
    \    send a message on a new link when 63 active transmit links already\n    exist,\
    \ a \"Link Table Full\" message will be sent from the IMP to\n    the Host, and\
    \ the message will be discarded.\"\n    p. 11 \"1.  Any link that is not used\
    \ for a period of 26 seconds\n       will have its entry automatically deleted\
    \ by the IMP program.\"\n"

    \  No, because there is no other way for links to be deleted\n           so they\

    \ never actually\n    reaches any Hosts since it will be discarded when it reaches\
    \ the \n    top of the IMP-HOST queue in the destination Host's IMP.  The\n  \
    \  Network Measurement Center will make use of this feature.\n    p. 13  Message\
    \ type 6 is no longer assigned, and message type 10\n    is really in octal so\
