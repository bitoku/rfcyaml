RFC 608 Network Information Center SRI International DoD INTERNET HOST
The ARPANET Official Network Host Table, as outlined in RFC 608, no longer suits the needs of the DoD community, nor does it follow a format suitable for internetting.
This paper specifies a new host table format applicable to both ARPANET and Internet needs.
In addition to host name to host address translation and selected protocol information, we have also included network and gateway name to address correspondence, and host operating system information.
This Host Table is utilized by the DoD Host Name Server maintained by the ARPANET Network Information Center (NIC) on behalf of the Defense Communications Agency (DCA)
It obsoletes the host table described in RFC 608.
LOCATION OF THE STANDARD DoD ONLINE HOST TABLE A machine translatable ASCII text version of the new DoD Host Table is online in the file
HOSTS.TXT on the SRI NIC host.
It can be obtained by connecting to host SRI NIC (10.0.0.73) from your local FTP server, logging in as user ANONYMOUS, password GUEST, and doing a 'get' on <NETINFO>HOSTS.TXT.
The same table may also be obtained via the NIC Host Name Server.
See Appendix A. for timeframe for cutover.
No blank or space characters are permitted as part of a name.
No distinction is made between upper and lower case.
The first character must be a letter.
The last character must not be a minus sign or period.
A host which serves as a GATEWAY should have " GATEWAY" or " GW" as part of its name.
A host which is a TIP or a TAC should have  " TIP" or " TAC" as part of its host name, if it is an ARPANET or DoD host.
Internet Addresses are 32 bit addresses (RFC 796).
In the host table described herein each address is represented by four decimal numbers separated by a period.
Each decimal number represents 1 Host Table Specification 3.
If the first bit of the first octet of the address is 0 (zero), then the next 7 bits of the first octet indicate the network number (Class A Address).
If the first two bits are 1,0 (one,zero), then the next 14 bits define the net number (Class B Address).
If the first 3 bits are 1,1,0 (one,one,zero), then the next 21 bits define the net number (Class C Address) (RFC 796).
The LOCAL ADDRESS portion of the internet address identifies a host within the network specified by the NET portion of the address.
For the ARPANET (a Class A network), the NET address is 10 (decimal) and the LOCAL ADDRESS maps as follows: the second octet defines the physical host, the third octet defines the logical host, and the fourth defines the IMP.
RFC 796 describes the local address mappings for several other networks.)
It is the responsibility of the user using this host table to translate it into whatever format is needed for his or her purposes.
Names and Addresses for DoD networks, gateways, and hosts will be negotiated and registered with the Network Information Center (NIC@SRI NIC or (415) 859 4775) before being used and before traffic is passed by a DoD host.
For an interim period the NIC will attempt to keep similar information for non DoD networks and hosts if this information is provided, and as long as it is needed, i.e., until intercommunicating network name servers are in place.
EXAMPLE OF NEW HOST TABLE FORMAT Host Table Specification NET :
10.0.0.77, 18.8.0.4 : MIT GW :: MOS :
IP/GW : HOST : 10.0.0.73 : SRI NIC,NIC : FOONLY F3 : TENEX : NCP/TELNET,NCP/FTP, TCP/TELNET,
Each host table entry is an ASCII text string comprised of 6 fields, where Field 1   KEYWORD indicating whether this entry pertains to a NET, GATEWAY, or HOST.
NET entries cannot have alternate addresses or nicknames.
Internet Address of Network, Gateway, or Host followed by alternate addresses Field 3
Official Name of Network, Gateway, or Host (with optional nicknames)
Operating System Host Table Specification Fields 4, 5 and 6 are optional.
Fields 3 6, if available, pertain to the first address in Field 2. '
Blanks' (spaces and tabs) are ignored between data elements or fields, but are disallowed within a data element.
Each entry ends with a colon.
The host table will be sorted by internet address.
Blanks' are spaces and tabs.
Continuation lines are lines that begin with at least one blank.
They may be used anywhere 'blanks' are legal to split an Host Table Specification BIBLIOGRAPHY 1.

Host Table Specification APPENDIX A.
The cutover date for use of the new host table is 1 May 1982.
The table below indicates which files will contain the old or the new versions of the host table for what period of time.
After 1 August 1982, the old format for <
HOSTS.TXT (specified in RFC 608) will no longer be supported.
These periods of overlap should give implementors time to make the necessary changes to programs accessing this file.
