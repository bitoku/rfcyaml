Abstract This document defines several subcodes for the BGP Cease NOTIFICATION message that would provide more information to aid network operators in correlating network events and diagnosing BGP peering issues.
This document defines several subcodes for the BGP Cease NOTIFICATION message that would provide more information to aid network operators in correlating network events and diagnosing BGP peering issues.
It also recommends that a BGP speaker implement a backoff mechanism in re trying a BGP connection after the speaker receives a NOTIFICATION message with certain CEASE subcode.
The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC 2119].
If a BGP speaker decides to terminate its peering with a neighbor because the number of address prefixes received from the neighbor exceeds a locally configured upper bound (as described in [BGP 4]), then the speaker MUST send to the neighbor a NOTIFICATION message with the Error Code Cease and the Error Subcode
"Maximum Number of Prefixes Reached".
The message MAY optionally include the Address Family information [BGP MP] and the upper bound in the "Data" field, as shown in Figure 1, where the meaning and use of the <AFI, SAFI> tuple is the same as defined in [BGP MP], Section 7.
Prefix upper bound (4 octets)
Figure 1: Optional Data Field
If a BGP speaker decides to administratively shut down its peering with a neighbor, then the speaker SHOULD send a NOTIFICATION message with the Error Code Cease and the Error Subcode "Administrative Shutdown".
If a BGP speaker decides to de configure a peer, then the speaker SHOULD send a NOTIFICATION message with the Error Code Cease and the Error Subcode "Peer De configured".
If a BGP speaker decides to administratively reset the peering with a neighbor, then the speaker SHOULD send a NOTIFICATION message with the Error Code Cease and the Error Subcode "Administrative Reset".
If a BGP speaker decides to disallow a BGP connection (e.g., the peer is not configured locally) after the speaker accepts a transport protocol connection, then the BGP speaker SHOULD send a NOTIFICATION message with the Error Code Cease and the Error Subcode "Connection Rejected".
If a BGP speaker decides to administratively reset the peering with a neighbor due to a configuration change other than the ones described above, then the speaker SHOULD send a NOTIFICATION message with the Error Code Cease and the Error Subcode "Other Configuration Change".
If a BGP speaker decides to send a NOTIFICATION message with the Error Code Cease as a result of the collision resolution procedure (as described in [BGP 4]), then the subcode SHOULD be set to "Connection Collision Resolution".
If a BGP speaker runs out of resources (e.g., memory) and decides to reset a session, then the speaker MAY send a NOTIFICATION message with the Error Code Cease and the Error Subcode "Out of Resources".
It is RECOMMENDED that a BGP speaker behave as though the DampPeerOscillations attribute [BGP 4] were true for this peer when re trying a BGP connection after the speaker receives a Cease NOTIFICATION message with a subcode of "Administrative Shutdown", "Peer De configured", "Connection Rejected", or "Out of Resources".
An implementation SHOULD impose an upper bound on the number of consecutive automatic retries.
Once this bound is reached, the implementation would stop re trying any BGP connections until some administrative intervention, i.e., set the AllowAutomaticStart attribute [BGP 4] to FALSE.
This document defines the subcodes 1 8 for the BGP Cease NOTIFICATION message.
Future assignments are to be made using either the Standards Action process defined in [RFC 2434], or the Early IANA Allocation process defined in [RFC 4020].
Assignments consist of a name and the value.
This extension to BGP does not change the underlying security issues inherent in the existing BGP.
