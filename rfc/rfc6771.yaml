  - "Abstract\n   New work is typically brought to the IETF by a group of interested\n\
    \   individuals.  IETF meetings are a convenient place for such groups to\n  \
    \ hold informal get-togethers to discuss and develop their ideas.  Such\n   side\
    \ meetings, which are not reflected in the IETF meeting agenda and\n   have no\
    \ official status, are often half-jokingly referred to as \"bar\n   BOF\" sessions\
    \ to acknowledge that some of them may eventually lead to\n   a proposal for an\
    \ official IETF BOF (\"birds of a feather\" session) on\n   a given topic.\n \
    \  During recent IETF meetings, many such \"bar BOF\" get-togethers have\n   been\
    \ organized and moderated in ways that made them increasingly\n   indistinguishable\
    \ from official IETF BOFs or sometimes even IETF\n   working group meetings.\n\
    \   This document argues that this recent trend is not helpful in\n   reaching\
    \ the ultimate goal of many of these get-togethers, i.e., to\n   efficiently discuss\
    \ and develop ideas for new IETF work.  It\n   encourages the organizers to consider\
    \ the benefits of holding them in\n   much less formal settings and to also consider\
    \ alternative means to\n   develop their ideas.  This document also recommends\
    \ that the\n   community abandon the term \"bar BOF\" and instead use other terms\
    \ such\n   as \"side meeting\", in order to stress the unofficial nature of these\n\
    \   get-togethers.\n"

- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   A typical IETF meeting is full of sessions of different\
    \ kinds.  In\n   addition to official IETF and IRTF sessions listed in the meeting\n\
    \   agenda (such as working and research group meetings, area meetings,\n   or\
    \ plenaries), many other unofficial meetings take place.  These\n   include meetings\
    \ between IETF participants from one organization or\n   company, design team\
    \ meetings, Internet-Draft editing sessions,\n   interoperability testing, directorate\
    \ lunches, and many others.\n   Some of these unofficial get-togethers are organized\
    \ by individual\n   participants with a common interest in initiating new IETF\
    \ work of\n   some kind.  New IETF work often fits into an existing working group\n\
    \   and does not require an official \"birds of a feather\" (BOF) session\n  \
    \ [RFC5434] to determine community consensus.  Nevertheless, the phrase\n   \"\
    bar BOF\" has commonly been used in the community when talking about\n   such\
    \ informal get-togethers that are held to discuss potential new\n   work.  [RFC4677]\
    \ (which has been obsoleted by [RFC6722])\n   characterizes a \"bar BOF\" as\n\
    \      an unofficial get-together, usually in the late evening, during\n     \
    \ which a lot of work gets done over drinks.  Bar BOFs spring up in\n      many\
    \ different places around an IETF meeting, such as restaurants,\n      coffee\
    \ shops, and (if we are so lucky) pools.\n   During recent IETF meetings, \"bar\
    \ BOFs\" have become increasingly\n   indistinguishable from official IETF BOFs\
    \ or sometimes even IETF\n   working group meetings.  The symptoms of this trend\
    \ are unofficial\n   \"bar BOFs\" that are held in regular IETF meeting rooms\
    \ with\n   classroom-style seating, agendas with lengthy slide presentations,\n\
    \   use of microphone lines, and even formal consensus calls.  And,\n   perhaps\
    \ most importantly, such meetings have a distinct lack of\n   drinks.\n   This\
    \ document argues that this trend is not helpful in reaching the\n   ultimate\
    \ goal of many of these get-togethers, i.e., to brainstorm\n   about a technical\
    \ topic that may eventually lead to new IETF work.\n   It encourages the organizers\
    \ of these unofficial get-togethers to\n   consider the benefits of holding them\
    \ in much less formal settings.\n   This document also recommends that the community\
    \ abandon the term\n   \"bar BOF\".  The distinction between a BOF, i.e., an official\
    \ IETF\n   activity, and a \"bar BOF\", i.e., an unofficial get-together, is lost\n\
    \   on many IETF participants, especially newcomers.  The similarity in\n   terms\
    \ has even caused confusion to the point where some participants\n   believe that\
    \ a \"bar BOF\" is a required step in the IETF process in\n   order to apply for\
    \ an official BOF, which is obviously false.  For\n   these reasons, the remainder\
    \ of this document will use the term \"side\n   meeting\" instead and recommends\
    \ that the community do the same, in\n   order to stress the unofficial nature\
    \ of these get-togethers.\n   Before going into more detailed advice on how to\
    \ hold side meetings,\n   it is important to remember that many participants are\
    \ extremely busy\n   during an IETF meeting.  Although having a side meeting to\
    \ discuss an\n   idea in an informal face-to-face setting is attractive, the\n\
    \   scheduling of such meetings is very difficult and needs to happen\n   weeks,\
    \ if not months, prior to the meeting itself.  Conference calls,\n   email discussions,\
    \ wikis, jabber group chats, and other ways for\n   interacting are also effective\
    \ at developing ideas and easier to\n   schedule.\n"
- title: 2.  How to Invite
  contents:
  - "2.  How to Invite\n   A good rule of thumb is that a side meeting to discuss\
    \ and develop a\n   proposal for new IETF work should include the necessary participants\n\
    \   to achieve that purpose and no more.  Smaller meetings are usually\n   more\
    \ successful than larger meetings.\n   Hence, it is often useful to limit attendance\
    \ carefully.  Publicly\n   broadcasting an announcement for a side meeting on\
    \ a particular\n   topic, e.g., on an IETF mailing list, is therefore not usually\
    \ a good\n   method of inviting the desired set of participants.\n   One reason\
    \ is that if the announcement happens to attract a large\n   response, the logistics\
    \ of organizing a side meeting for a larger\n   group quickly becomes very difficult.\
    \  Small groups fit comfortably\n   around a table at a bar or a restaurant or\
    \ can find a quiet corner in\n   an IETF hallway for a discussion.  Larger groups\
    \ require dedicated\n   meeting facilities, which are limited during IETF meetings,\
    \ and they\n   generally require much more careful planning in order to get work\n\
    \   done.\n   When publicly announcing a side meeting, it is often not even\n\
    \   possible for the organizers to determine how large the resulting get-\n  \
    \ together will be, forcing them to over-provision for the \"best case\"\n   of\
    \ a substantial attendance, even in cases where this turns out to be\n   not necessary.\
    \  And even when a large group comes together, it often\n   mostly consists of\
    \ \"tourists\".  Tourists usually do not actively\n   participate in the get-together\
    \ at all, or they participate with an\n   intent to learn about a topic, which\
    \ can derail a planned discussion\n   of specific issues and turn it into a tutorial.\
    \  The attendance of\n   tourists requires finding a larger room and makes the\
    \ interactions\n   between the active participants more cumbersome, e.g., because\n\
    \   microphones need to be used in larger rooms.  There are times to\n   expose\
    \ new ideas to a broader community, but think carefully before\n   publicly announcing\
    \ a side meeting.\n   So while publicly announcing a side meeting can be useful\
    \ in order to\n   gather interested people for a discussion, it often makes sense\
    \ to\n   still limit attendance.  For example, an announcement could say, \"We\n\
    \   have a table reserved at restaurant X for Y people.  If you are\n   interested\
    \ in attending, please briefly explain how you will\n   contribute to the discussion\
    \ we are planning to have\".  If more than\n   Y people respond, the organizers\
    \ make a selection.\n   Selecting or specifically inviting IESG or IAB members\
    \ is not\n   necessary and may not even be advisable in many cases.  Some ideas\n\
    \   need time to form before they result in anything cohesive, and a side\n  \
    \ meeting is a good time to develop new ideas.  It is usually most\n   useful\
    \ to approach Area Directors (ADs) and IAB members for comments\n   after an idea\
    \ has solidified enough so that an elevator pitch can be\n   given.  Also, it\
    \ should be clear that if an AD or IAB member attends\n   a side meeting, it is\
    \ not necessarily a show of support.  They may\n   simply be interested or often\
    \ may be concerned or troubled with some\n   aspect of the potential work and\
    \ relation to existing work.  On the\n   other hand, when an AD or IAB member\
    \ declines to attend a side\n   meeting, that is usually not a sign of disinterest\
    \ or disapproval --\n   these people have busy schedules, especially during an\
    \ IETF week.\n   In the initial stages of developing a proposal for new IETF work,\
    \ the\n   ability for interested and experienced participants to brainstorm is\n\
    \   tremendously important.  Brainstorming is facilitated by direct,\n   interactive,\
    \ and high-bandwidth discussions.  This is clearly much\n   more easily achieved\
    \ in a smaller setting, where half-baked ideas can\n   be dissected and developed.\
    \  This is often not possible in a larger\n   group.  Even worse, a badly run\
    \ large meeting can sometimes \"poison\n   the waters\" for a proposed idea by\
    \ convincing the broader community\n   that the proposal is confused, not ready,\
    \ or otherwise uninteresting.\n   Another reason to discuss new work proposals\
    \ in smaller groups is\n   scope creep, i.e., the tendency of an initially rather\
    \ tightly scoped\n   area of new work to expand, because people will argue that\
    \ whatever\n   the initial topic was, it should be expanded to include their\n\
    \   particular item of interest.  This is harder to control in larger\n   groups.\
    \  Keeping the scope of new work items narrow is important,\n   because eventual\
    \ chartering decisions are often much more difficult\n   for larger items of new\
    \ work than for smaller ones.\n   It is important to understand that in the IETF,\
    \ proposals for new\n   work are judged based on their technical merits and on\
    \ whether there\n   is enough energy and interest in the community to complete\
    \ the work\n   in a timely manner.  This happens in the relevant working group,\
    \ if\n   one exists, or else during an official BOF session.  How many warm\n\
    \   bodies fill a room during an unofficial side meeting has no influence\n  \
    \ on this decision and is not a good metric for reporting interest in a\n   topic\
    \ to the community or to employers.  Discussions about new work\n   are often\
    \ controversial, and people will show up just to watch the\n   fireworks, learn\
    \ about a new topic, or make sure the new work does\n   not interfere with work\
    \ they are already pursuing, without being\n   interested contributing in some\
    \ way to the actual proposal itself.\n   Some side meetings are organized to discuss\
    \ a topic that is also\n   being discussed in an existing working group, either\
    \ before or after\n   the working group itself meets.  Some working groups call\
    \ these side\n   meetings \"ad hoc sessions\".  The fact that a side meeting is\n\
    \   organized by a chair or key participant of a working group in order\n   to\
    \ discuss topics related to the working group does not make it any\n   more official\
    \ than other side meetings.  An \"ad hoc session\" is not\n   an official working\
    \ group session, and no decisions relevant to a\n   working group can be made.\
    \  Working group consensus can only be\n   established during official sessions\
    \ or on the mailing list\n   [RFC2418].\n"
- title: 3.  Where to Meet
  contents:
  - "3.  Where to Meet\n   As the colloquial name \"bar BOF\" implied, such side meetings\
    \ are\n   traditionally held in bars or restaurants.  Recently, there has been\n\
    \   a distinct shift towards holding such get-togethers in regular IETF\n   meeting\
    \ rooms.  One reason for this trend has been discussed in\n   Section 2, namely,\
    \ that an uncontrolled broadcast announcement\n   requires over-provisioning of\
    \ facilities.\n   A second reason for this trend is that some participants, e.g.,\
    \ non-\n   native English speakers or participants with hearing difficulties,\n\
    \   find it difficult to interact or follow a discussion in noisy\n   environments,\
    \ such as restaurants and especially bars.  The\n   organizers of side meetings\
    \ are encouraged to take this factor into\n   consideration when finding a meeting\
    \ place.  Quiet restaurants are\n   not hard to find, and many offer private dining\
    \ rooms at no extra\n   charge for larger parties.\n   A likely third reason why\
    \ side meetings are increasingly held in IETF\n   rooms is that the booking of\
    \ such a room currently requires approval\n   by an Area Director.  The reason\
    \ for this practice is simply to make\n   sure that IETF-paid rooms are used for\
    \ meetings that are in the\n   widest sense IETF-related.  However, the approval\
    \ of a room request\n   for a side meeting has been known to sometimes be reported\
    \ as Area\n   Director \"support\" for the topic of the meeting to the community\
    \ or\n   to employers.  No such support is expressed or implied when Area\n  \
    \ Directors approve room requests!  Many routinely say \"yes\" to every\n   incoming\
    \ request as long as there are meeting rooms available (and\n   there are typically\
    \ lots of meeting rooms available outside of normal\n   working group meeting\
    \ slots).\n   Holding side meetings in IETF meeting rooms does not make them any\n\
    \   more official or valid than get-togethers that happen in other\n   places.\
    \  Participants have recently begun to list the times and\n   locations of some\
    \ side meetings on a wiki page, but that does not\n   make them part of the official\
    \ IETF agenda or otherwise change their\n   unofficial status.\n   IETF meeting\
    \ rooms clearly do not provide the most supportive\n   environment for side meetings\
    \ that require brainstorming on a new\n   technical proposal.  One reason is that\
    \ the classroom-style seating\n   often present in IETF meeting rooms tends to\
    \ spread people out in\n   rows, all facing towards a front presenter, which is\
    \ good for\n   presentations but bad for discussion.  Because IETF meeting rooms\n\
    \   tend to be large and people have a natural tendency to spread out,\n   holding\
    \ a meeting in one often requires microphone use, which is\n   cumbersome, slows\
    \ a discussion down, and leads to \"question-answer\"\n   dialogs between two\
    \ people, which is much less effective than a group\n   discussion around a restaurant\
    \ table.\n   Another reason is more pragmatic.  Because the organizers of\n  \
    \ unofficial get-togethers can only use IETF meeting rooms during times\n   when\
    \ they are not otherwise in use, such side meetings often happen\n   during breakfast,\
    \ lunch, dinner, or later in the evening.  This\n   prolongs the time during which\
    \ IETF participants are stuck in the\n   same rooms they're stuck in for the rest\
    \ of the day, and it prevents\n   them from having a regular and at least somewhat\
    \ relaxed meal.\n   Anecdotal evidence exists that at least one Area Director\
    \ has not\n   been able to set foot outside the IETF hotel for a stretch of several\n\
    \   days during IETF 77.  (IETF 77 was held in Anaheim, CA, and the food\n   options\
    \ in and near the hotel were, let's say, of severely limited\n   quality.)  It\
    \ is unlikely that participants in the consequential\n   mental and bodily state\
    \ will make productive contributions to a side\n   meeting or, in the case of\
    \ Area Directors, will be extremely\n   receptive towards new work proposals.\n\
    \   Food, drink, and a relaxed atmosphere in which to have a discussion\n   are\
    \ an essential part of a successful side meeting, because they\n   often need\
    \ to happen during meal times.  IETF meeting rooms offer\n   neither.\n"
- title: 4.  How to Meet
  contents:
  - "4.  How to Meet\n   Several of the recent side meetings that were held in IETF\
    \ meeting\n   rooms emulated official IETF meetings to a degree that made them\n\
    \   indistinguishable from a regular working group meeting for the\n   average\
    \ IETF attendee.  This included detailed agendas, lengthy\n   presentations, organizers\
    \ who refer to themselves as \"bar BOF\n   chairs\", emulating blue sheets (see\
    \ Section 4.5 of [RFC4677]), and\n   even hums and other consensus calls (see\
    \ Section 5.2 of [RFC4677]).\n   It is not clear as to why this has been happening.\
    \  One attempt at an\n   explanation may be that holding a get-together in an\
    \ IETF room and\n   having the organizers behave like chairs behave during regular\
    \ IETF\n   sessions is causing a Pavlovian stimulus in the attendees.  Another\n\
    \   explanation attempt is that an IETF meeting room simply does not\n   allow\
    \ many other forms of discussion.  Finally, some organizers may\n   find the process\
    \ to apply for an official BOF too complex or\n   troublesome (and probably rightfully\
    \ so) and so decide to simply\n   mimic one, or they had applied for an official\
    \ BOF, got turned down,\n   and then decided to hold the same meeting as a side\
    \ meeting.\n   Whatever the reason for this development, it is reasonably obvious\n\
    \   that running a side meeting with a focus on making quick progress on\n   a\
    \ technical proposal in a way that emulates running a working group\n   session\
    \ is not very productive.  Working group sessions follow\n   certain procedures\
    \ due to larger audiences, the need to establish\n   formal consensus, etc., that\
    \ a side meeting can do without.\n   Having side meetings mimic working group\
    \ meetings is also confusing\n   to attendees.  In at least one case, some side\
    \ meeting participants\n   believed that they were attending an actual working\
    \ group meeting,\n   and incorrect press announcements were generated.  When side\
    \ meetings\n   take place at restaurants or elsewhere away from IETF meeting rooms,\n\
    \   the chance for confusion is much lower.\n   Because the reasons for organizing\
    \ such a get-together are diverse,\n   this section is not making more specific\
    \ suggestions, other than to\n   note that meeting outside of an IETF meeting\
    \ room is likely going to\n   shift the dynamics sufficiently so that better interactions\
    \ and\n   results become possible.\n"
- title: 5.  When to Meet
  contents:
  - "5.  When to Meet\n   Side meetings are often scheduled following IETF evening\
    \ plenaries,\n   which sometimes end before the time indicated on the meeting\
    \ agenda\n   but have in the past also ended much later.  It is therefore useful\n\
    \   to avoid scheduling side meetings that follow IETF plenaries at a\n   fixed\
    \ time.  Instead, it is recommended to schedule them relative to\n   the end of\
    \ the plenary, i.e., \"X minutes after the end of the\n   plenary\".  That way,\
    \ attendees do not need to wait around if a\n   plenary finishes early and do\
    \ not need to leave a plenary should it\n   run late.\n   Section 3 of [RFC5434]\
    \ raises the issue that it is essential to\n   understand all angles of a given\
    \ problem for which IETF work is\n   proposed.  This means that input from the\
    \ community that can be found\n   at IETF meetings is not all that should be considered.\
    \  It can be\n   argued that input from other communities -- operator, research,\n\
    \   regulatory, etc. -- is at least as important.  Hence, organizers\n   should\
    \ consider the value of holding side meetings at venues where\n   such input can\
    \ be more easily gathered, such as operator fora (RIPE,\n   NANOG, etc.), research\
    \ conferences, or other events.\n"
- title: 6.  Conclusions
  contents:
  - "6.  Conclusions\n   Side meeting organizers are encouraged to rekindle the original\n\
    \   spirit behind them and organize them outside IETF meeting rooms, at\n   venues\
    \ with food and drink, for smaller groups, and in a way that\n   does not needlessly\
    \ mimic the way official IETF sessions are\n   conducted.\n   It can often be\
    \ useful to discuss proposals for new IETF work face-\n   to-face in an informal\
    \ setting, but conference calls, email\n   discussions, wikis, and other means\
    \ for interactions are also\n   effective at developing ideas, especially given\
    \ the scheduling\n   difficulties when busy individuals are involved during an\
    \ IETF\n   meeting.\n   Finally, it is important to remember that all side meetings\
    \ during an\n   IETF week are purely informal and have no official status whatsoever.\n"

  - "7.  Security Considerations\n   A security AD pointed out that people have been\
    \ known to forget their\n   laptops after side meetings held in real bars.  The\
    \ organizers of\n   side meetings should therefore remind any attending security\
    \ ADs (and\n   possibly others) to take their belongings with them after the side\n\
    \   meeting ends or the bar closes, whichever happens first.\n"
