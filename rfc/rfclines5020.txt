Abstract This document describes the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP)
/ X.500 'entryDN' operational attribute.
The attribute provides a copy of the entry's distinguished name for use in attribute value assertions.
In X.500 Directory Services [X.501], such as those accessible using the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP)
[RFC4510], an entry is identified by its distinguished name (DN) [RFC4512].
However, as an entry's DN is not an attribute of the entry, it is not possible to perform attribute value assertions [RFC4511] against it.
This document describes the 'entryDN' operational attribute which holds a copy of the entry's distinguished name.
This attribute may be used in search filters.
For instance, searching the subtree <dc example,dc com> with the filter:
ou A,dc example,dc com> and entries in subtree <ou B
,dc example,dc com>, but would not return any other entries in the subtree
In the above paragraph, DNs are presented using the string representation defined in [RFC4514], and the example search filter is presented using the string representation defined in [RFC4515] with whitespace (line breaks and indentation) added to improve readability.
The 'componentFilterMatch' and 'rdnMatch' rules are specified in [RFC3687].
Schema definitions are provided using LDAP description formats [RFC4512].
Definitions provided here are formatted (line wrapped) for readability.
'entryDN' Operational Attribute The 'entryDN' operational attribute provides a copy of the entry's current DN.
The following is an LDAP attribute type description suitable for publication in subschema subentries.
( 1.3.6.1.1.20 NAME 'entryDN' DESC 'DN of the entry' EQUALITY distinguishedNameMatch
NO USER MODIFICATION USAGE directoryOperation )
Note that the DN of the entry cannot be modified through this attribute.
As this attribute only provides an additional mechanism to access an entry's DN, the introduction of this attribute is not believed to introduce new security considerations.
