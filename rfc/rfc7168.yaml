- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   As noted in the Hyper Text Coffee Pot Control Protocol [HTCPCP],\n\
    \   coffee is renowned worldwide as an artfully brewed caffeinated\n   beverage,\
    \ but coffee shares this quality with many other varied\n   preparations based\
    \ on the filtration of plant material.  Foremost,\n   among these are the category\
    \ of brews based on the straining of water\n   through prepared leaves from a\
    \ tea tree: the lineage and history of\n   the tea genus will not be recounted\
    \ as part of this paper, but\n   evidence shows that the production of tea existed\
    \ many thousands of\n   years ago.\n   The deficiency of HTCPCP in addressing\
    \ the networked production of\n   such a venerable beverage as tea is noteworthy:\
    \ indeed, the only\n   provision given for networked teapots is that they not\
    \ respond to\n   requests for the production of coffee, which, while eminently\n\
    \   reasonable, does not allow for communication with the teapot for its\n   intended\
    \ purpose.\n   This paper specifies an extension to HTCPCP to allow communication\n\
    \   with networked tea production devices and teapots.  The additions to\n   the\
    \ protocol specified herein permit the requests and responses\n   necessary to\
    \ control all devices capable of making, arguably, the\n   most popular caffeinated\
    \ hot beverage.\n"

- title: 2.  HTCPCP-TEA Protocol Additions
  contents:
  - "2.  HTCPCP-TEA Protocol Additions\n   The TEA extension to HTCPCP adapts the\
    \ operation of certain HTCPCP\n   methods.\n"
- title: 2.1.  BREW and POST Methods
  contents:
  - "2.1.  BREW and POST Methods\n   Control of a TEA-capable pot is performed, as\
    \ described in the base\n   HTCPCP specification, through the sending of BREW\
    \ requests.  POST\n   requests are treated equivalently, but they remain deprecated.\
    \  Tea\n   production differs from coffee, however, in that a choice of teas is\n\
    \   often provided for client selection before the tea is brewed.  To\n   this\
    \ end, a TEA-capable pot that receives a BREW message of content\n   type \"message/teapot\"\
    \ MUST respond in accordance with the URI\n   requested, as below.\n"
- title: 2.1.1.  The "/" URI
  contents:
  - "2.1.1.  The \"/\" URI\n   For the URI \"/\", brewing will not commence.  Instead,\
    \ an Alternates\n   header as defined in RFC 2295 [RFC2295] MUST be sent, with\
    \ the\n   available tea bags and/or leaf varieties as entries.  An example of\n\
    \   such a response is as follows:\n      Alternates: {\"/darjeeling\" {type message/teapot}},\n\
    \                  {\"/earl-grey\" {type message/teapot}},\n                 \
    \ {\"/peppermint\" {type message/teapot}}\n   The following example demonstrates\
    \ the possibility of\n   interoperability of a TEA-capable pot that also complies\
    \ with the\n   base HTCPCP specification:\n      Alternates: {\"/\" {type message/coffeepot}},\n\
    \                  {\"/pot-0/darjeeling\" {type message/teapot}},\n          \
    \        {\"/pot-0/earl-grey\" {type message/teapot}},\n                  {\"\
    /pot-1/peppermint\" {type message/teapot}}\n   TEA-capable HTCPCP clients MUST\
    \ check the contents of the Alternates\n   header returned by a BREW request,\
    \ and provide a specific URI for\n   subsequent requests of the \"message/teapot\"\
    \ type.\n   A request to the \"/\" URI with a Content-Type header of\n   \"message/coffeepot\"\
    \ SHOULD also be responded to with an Alternates\n   header in the above format,\
    \ to allow TEA-capable clients the\n   opportunity to present the selection of\
    \ teas to the user if inferior\n   caffeinated beverages have initially been requested.\n"
- title: 2.1.2.  Variety-Specific URIs
  contents:
  - "2.1.2.  Variety-Specific URIs\n   TEA-capable pots follow the base HTCPCP specification\
    \ when presented\n   with a BREW request for a specific variety of tea.  Pots\
    \ SHOULD\n   follow the recommendations for brewing strength given by each\n \
    \  variety, and stop brewing when this strength is reached; it is\n   suggested\
    \ that the strength be measured by detection of the opacity\n   of the beverage\
    \ currently under brew by the pot.\n   TEA-capable clients SHOULD indicate the\
    \ end of brewing by sending a\n   BREW request with an entity body containing\
    \ \"stop\"; the pot MAY\n   continue brewing beyond the recommended strength until\
    \ this is\n   received.  If the \"stop\" request is not sent by the client, this\
    \ may\n   result in a state inversion in the proportion of tea to water in the\n\
    \   brewing pot, which may be reported by some pots as a negative\n   strength.\n\
    \   If a BREW command with an entity body containing \"stop\" is received\n  \
    \ before the recommended strength is achieved, the pot MUST abort\n   brewing\
    \ and serve the resultant beverage at lesser strength.  Finding\n   the preferred\
    \ strength of beverage when using this override is a\n   function of the time\
    \ between the TEA-capable pot receiving a \"start\"\n   request and the subsequent\
    \ \"stop\".  Clients SHOULD be prepared to\n   make multiple attempts to reach\
    \ the preferred strength.\n"

- title: 2.2.1.  The Accept-Additions Header Field
  contents:
  - "2.2.1.  The Accept-Additions Header Field\n   It has been observed that some\
    \ users of blended teas have an\n   occasional preference for teas brewed as an\
    \ emulsion of cane sugar\n   with hints of water.  To allow for this circumstance,\
    \ the Accept-\n   Additions header field defined in the base HTCPCP specification\
    \ is\n   updated to allow the following options:\n      addition-type   = ( \"\
    *\"\n                        | milk-type\n                        | syrup-type\n\

    Sugar\" | \"Xylitol\" | \"Stevia\" )\n   Implementers should be aware that excessive\
    \ use of the Sugar addition\n   may cause the BREW request to exceed the segment\
    \ size allowed by the\n   transport layer, causing fragmentation and a delay in\
    \ brewing.\n"

    \ be\n   served with a status code of 300, to indicate that brewing has not\n\

    \ a new MIME media\n   type is defined by this document.  The Content-Type header\
    \ of a POST\n   or BREW request sent to a TEA-capable pot MUST be \"message/teapot\"\
    \ if\n   tea is to be requested.\n"
- title: 4.  Environmental Considerations
  contents:
  - "4.  Environmental Considerations\n   As noted in Section 2.1, a BREW request\
    \ with a Content-Type header\n   field of \"message/teapot\" to a TEA-capable\
    \ pot will result in an\n   Alternates header being sent with the response, and\
    \ a pot will not be\n   brewed.  However, if the BREW request has a Content-Type\
    \ of\n   \"message/coffeepot\", and the pot is capable of brewing coffee, the\n\
    \   service's behavior will fall back to the base HTCPCP specification\n   and\
    \ a pot will be brewed.\n   If the entity returned by the server when brewing\
    \ commences contains\n   a TEA-compliant Alternates header indicating \"message/coffeepot\"\
    \ and\n   the client does not want coffee, the client SHOULD then send a BREW\n\
    \   request with an entity body containing \"stop\".  This will result in\n  \
    \ wasted coffee; whether this is regarded as a bad thing is user-\n   defined.\n\
    \   Such waste can be prevented by TEA-capable clients, by first\n   requesting\
    \ a BREW of type \"message/teapot\" and then allowing\n   selection of an available\
    \ beverage.\n"
- title: 5.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "5.  Security Considerations\n   As with the base HTCPCP specification, most TEA-capable\
    \ pots are\n   expected to heat water through the use of electric elements, and\
    \ as\n   such will not be in proximity to fire.  Therefore, no firewalls are\n\
    \   necessary for communication with these pots to proceed.\n   This extension\
    \ does support communication with fired pots, however,\n   which may require heat\
    \ retention and control policies.  Care should\n   be taken so that coal-fired\
    \ pots and electrically heated kettles are\n   not connected to the same network,\
    \ to prevent pots from referring to\n   any kettles on the network as darkened\
    \ or otherwise smoke driven.\n"
