  - "1.  Introduction\n   A host may have multiple network interfaces (e.g., 3G, IEEE\
    \ 802.11,\n   etc.), each configured with different PCP servers.  Each PCP server\n\
    \   learned must be associated with the interface on which it was\n   learned.\
    \  Generic multi-interface considerations are documented in\n   Section 8.4 of\
    \ [RFC6887].  Multiple PCP server IP addresses may be\n   configured on a PCP\
    \ client in some deployment contexts such as\n   multihoming (see Appendix A).\
    \  A PCP server may also have multiple IP\n   addresses associated with it.  It\
    \ is out of the scope of this\n   document to enumerate all deployment scenarios\
    \ that require multiple\n   PCP server IP addresses to be configured.\n   If a\
    \ PCP client discovers multiple PCP server IP addresses, it needs\n   to determine\
    \ which actions it needs to undertake (e.g., whether PCP\n   entries are to be\
    \ installed in all or a subset of discovered IP\n   addresses, whether some PCP\
    \ entries are to be removed, etc.).  This\n   document makes the following assumptions:\n\
    \   o  There is no requirement that multiple PCP servers configured on\n     \
    \ the same interface have the same capabilities.\n   o  PCP requests to different\
    \ PCP servers are independent, the result\n      of a PCP request to one PCP server\
    \ does not influence another.\n   o  The configuration mechanism must distinguish\
    \ IP addresses that\n      belong to the same PCP server.\n   This document specifies\
    \ the behavior to be followed by a PCP client\n   [RFC6887] to contact its PCP\
    \ server(s) [RFC6887] when it is\n   configured with one or several PCP server\
    \ IP addresses (e.g., using\n   DHCP [RFC7291]).  This document does not make\
    \ any assumption on the\n   type of these IP addresses (i.e., unicast/anycast).\n"

- title: '3.  IP Address Selection: PCP Server with Multiple IP Addresses'
  contents:
  - "3.  IP Address Selection: PCP Server with Multiple IP Addresses\n   This section\
    \ describes the behavior a PCP client follows to contact\n   its PCP server when\
    \ the PCP client has multiple IP addresses for a\n   single PCP server.\n   1.\
    \  A PCP client should construct a set of candidate source addresses\n       (see\
    \ Section 4 of [RFC6724]) based on application input and PCP\n       [RFC6887]\
    \ constraints.  For example, when sending a PEER or a MAP\n       with a FILTER\
    \ request for an existing TCP connection, the only\n       candidate source address\
    \ is the source address used for the\n       existing TCP connection.  But when\
    \ sending a MAP request for a\n       service that will accept incoming connections,\
    \ the candidate\n       source addresses may be all of the node's IP addresses\
    \ or some\n       subset of IP addresses on which the service is configured to\n\
    \       listen.\n   2.  The PCP client then sorts the PCP server IP addresses\
    \ as per\n       Section 6 of [RFC6724] using the candidate source addresses\n\
    \       selected in the previous step as input to the destination address\n  \
    \     selection algorithm.\n   3.  The PCP client initializes its Maximum Retransmission\
    \ Count (MRC)\n       to 4.\n   4.  The PCP client sends its PCP messages following\
    \ the\n       retransmission procedure specified in Section 8.1.1 of [RFC6887].\n\
    \       If no response is received after MRC attempts, the PCP client\n      \
    \ retries the procedure with the next IP address in the sorted\n       list.\n\
    \       The PCP client may receive a response from an IP address after\n     \
    \  exhausting MRC attempts for that particular IP address.  The PCP\n       client\
    \ SHOULD ignore such a response because receiving a delayed\n       response after\
    \ exhausting four retransmissions sent with\n       exponentially increasing intervals\
    \ is an indication that problems\n       are to be encountered in the corresponding\
    \ forwarding path and/or\n       when processing subsequent requests by that PCP\
    \ server instance.\n       If, when sending PCP requests, the PCP client receives\
    \ a hard\n       ICMP error [RFC1122], it MUST immediately try the next IP address\n\
    \       from the list of PCP server IP addresses.\n   5.  If the PCP client has\
    \ exhausted all IP addresses configured for a\n       given PCP server, the procedure\
    \ SHOULD be repeated every 15\n       minutes until the PCP request is successfully\
    \ answered.\n   6.  Once the PCP client has successfully received a response from\
    \ a\n       PCP server's IP address, all subsequent PCP requests to that PCP\n\
    \       server are sent on the same IP address until that IP address\n       becomes\
    \ unresponsive.  In case the IP address becomes\n       unresponsive, the PCP\
    \ client clears the cache of sorted\n       destination addresses and follows\
    \ the steps described above to\n       contact the PCP server again.\n   For efficiency,\
    \ the PCP client SHOULD use the same Mapping Nonce for\n   requests sent to all\
    \ IP addresses belonging to the same PCP server.\n   As a reminder, nonce validation\
    \ checks are performed when operating\n   in the Simple Threat Model (see Section\
    \ 18.1 of [RFC6887]) to defend\n   against some off-path attacks.\n"

  contents:
  - "4.  IP Address Selection: Multiple PCP Servers\n   This section describes the\
    \ behavior a PCP client follows to contact\n   multiple PCP servers, with each\
    \ PCP server reachable on a list of IP\n   addresses.  There is no requirement\
    \ that these multiple PCP servers\n   have the same capabilities.\n      Note\
    \ that how PCP clients are configured to separate lists of IP\n      addresses\
    \ of each PCP server is implementation specific and\n      deployment specific.\
    \  For example, a PCP client can be configured\n      using DHCP with multiple\
    \ lists of PCP server IP addresses; each\n      list is referring to a distinct\
    \ PCP server [RFC7291].\n   If several PCP servers are configured, each with multiple\
    \ IP\n   addresses, the PCP client contacts all PCP servers using the\n   procedure\
    \ described in Section 3.\n   As specified in Sections 11.2 and 12.2 of [RFC6887],\
    \ the PCP client\n   must use a different Mapping Nonce for each PCP server with\
    \ which it\n   communicates.\n   If the PCP client is configured, using some means,\
    \ with the\n   capabilities of each PCP server, a PCP client may choose to contact\n\
    \   all PCP servers simultaneously or iterate through them with a delay.\n   This\
    \ procedure may result in a PCP client instantiating multiple\n   mappings maintained\
    \ by distinct PCP servers.  The decision to use all\n   these mappings or delete\
    \ some of them depends on the purpose of the\n   PCP request.  For example, if\
    \ the PCP servers are configuring\n   firewall (not NAT) functionality, then the\
    \ client would, by default\n   (i.e., unless it knows that they all replicate\
    \ state among them),\n   need to use all the PCP servers.\n"

    \              Figure 1: Single Uplink, Multiple PCP Servers\n   The example describes\
    \ behavior when a single IP address for one PCP\n   server is not responsive.\
    \  The PCP client is configured with two PCP\n   servers for the same interface,\
    \ PCP-Server-A and PCP-Server-B, each\n   of which have two IP addresses: an IPv4\
    \ address and an IPv6 address.\n   The PCP client wants an IPv4 mapping, so it\
    \ orders the addresses as\n   follows:\n   o  PCP-Server-A:\n      *  192.0.2.1\n\
    \      *  2001:db8:1111::1\n   o  PCP-Server-B:\n      *  198.51.100.1\n     \
    \ *  2001:db8:2222::1\n   Suppose that:\n   o  The path to reach 192.0.2.1 is\
    \ broken\n   o  The path to reach 2001:db8:1111::1 is working\n   o  The path\
    \ to reach 198.51.100.1 is working\n   o  The path to reach 2001:db8:2222::1 is\
    \ working\n   It sends two PCP requests at the same time, the first to 192.0.2.1\n\
    \   (corresponding to PCP-Server-A) and the second to 198.51.100.1\n   (corresponding\
    \ to PCP-Server-B).  The path to 198.51.100.1 is\n   working, so a PCP response\
    \ is received.  Because the path to\n   192.0.2.1 is broken, no PCP response is\
    \ received.  The PCP client\n   retries four times to elicit a response from 192.0.2.1\
    \ and finally\n   gives up on that address and sends a PCP message to 2001::db8:1111:1.\n\
    \   That path is working, and a response is received.  Thereafter, the\n   PCP\
    \ client should continue using that responsive IP address for PCP-\n   Server-A\
    \ (2001:db8:1111::1).  In this particular case, it will have\n   to use the THIRD_PARTY\
    \ option for IPv4 mappings.\n"

  - "A.2.  IPv4 Multihoming\n   In this example of an IPv4 multihomed network described\
    \ in \"NAT- or\n   RFC2260-based Multihoming\" (Section 3.3 of [RFC4116]), the\
    \ gateway\n   router is connected to different service provider networks.  This\n\
    \   method uses Provider-Aggregatable (PA) addresses assigned by each\n   transit\
    \ provider to which the site is connected.  The site uses NAT\n   to translate\
    \ the various provider addresses into a single set of\n   private-use addresses\
    \ within the site.  In such a case, two PCP\n   servers might have to be present\
    \ to configure NAT to each of the\n   transit providers.  The PCP client learns\
    \ the available PCP servers\n   using DHCP [RFC7291] or any other provisioning\
    \ mechanism.  In\n   reference to Figure 3, a typical model is to embed the DHCP\
    \ server\n   and the PCP servers in rtr1.  A host located behind rtr1 can contact\n\
    \   the DHCP server to obtain IP addresses of the PCP servers.  The PCP\n   client\
    \ will send PCP requests in parallel to each of the PCP servers.\n           \
