  - "1.  Introduction\n   The Incident Object Description Exchange Format (IODEF)\
    \ [RFC5070]\n   describes an XML document format for the purpose of exchanging\
    \ data\n   between Computer Security Incident Response Teams (CSIRTs) or those\n\
    \   responsible for security incident handling for network providers\n   (NPs).\
    \  The defined document format provides an easy way for CSIRTs\n   to exchange\
    \ data in a way that can be easily parsed.\n   IODEF defines a message format,\
    \ not a transport protocol, as the\n   sharing of messages is assumed to be out\
    \ of scope in order to allow\n   CSIRTs to exchange and store messages in a way\
    \ most suited to their\n   established incident handling processes.  However,\
    \ Real-time\n   Inter-network Defense (RID) [RFC6045] does require a specification\
    \ of\n   a transport protocol to ensure interoperability among members in a\n\
    \   RID consortium.  This document specifies the transport of RID\n   messages\
    \ within HTTP [RFC2616] Request and Response messages\n   transported over Transport\
    \ Layer Security (TLS) [RFC5246] (herein,\n   HTTP/TLS).  Note that any IODEF\
    \ message may also be transported using\n   this mechanism, by sending it as a\
    \ RID Report message.\n"

- title: 3.  Transmission of RID Messages over HTTP/TLS
  contents:
  - "3.  Transmission of RID Messages over HTTP/TLS\n   This section specifies the\
    \ details of the transport of RID messages\n   over HTTP/TLS.  In this arrangement,\
    \ each RID server is both an HTTP/\n   TLS server and an HTTP/TLS client.  When\
    \ a RID message must be sent,\n   the sending RID system connects to the receiving\
    \ RID system and sends\n   the message, optionally receiving a message in reply.\
    \  All RID\n   systems MUST be prepared to accept HTTP/TLS connections from any\
    \ RID\n   peer with which it communicates, in order to support callback for\n\
    \   delayed replies (see below).\n   BCP 56 [RFC3205] contains a number of important\
    \ considerations when\n   using HTTP for application protocols.  These include\
    \ the size of the\n   payload for the application, whether the application will\
    \ use a web\n   browser, whether the protocol should be defined on a port other\
    \ than\n   80, and if the security provided through HTTP/TLS suits the needs of\n\
    \   the new application.\n   It is acknowledged within the scope of these concerns\
    \ that HTTP/TLS\n   is not ideally suited for RID transport, as the former is\
    \ a client-\n   server protocol and the latter a message-exchange protocol; however,\n\
    \   the ease of implementation of RID systems over HTTP/TLS outweighs\n   these\
    \ concerns.  Consistent with BCP 56, RID systems will listen for\n   TCP connections\
    \ on port 4590.  Every RID system participating in a\n   consortium MUST listen\
    \ for HTTP/TLS connections on the assigned port.\n   All RID messages sent in\
    \ HTTP Requests MUST be sent using the POST\n   with a Request-URI of \"/\"; additional\
    \ Request-URI paths are reserved\n   for future use by RID.\n   Table 1 lists\
    \ the allowable RID message types in an HTTP Response for\n   a given RID message\
    \ type in the Request.  A RID system MUST be\n   prepared to handle an HTTP Response\
    \ of the given type(s) when sending\n   the corresponding HTTP Request.  A RID\
    \ system MUST NOT send an HTTP\n   Response containing any RID message other than\
    \ the one corresponding\n   to the one sent in the HTTP Request.\n   As the queries\
    \ and replies in a RID message exchange may be\n   significantly separated in\
    \ time, the receiving RID system MAY return\n   202 Accepted, terminate the connection,\
    \ and at a later time connect\n   to the requesting RID system and send the RID\
    \ reply in an HTTP\n   Request.  This mechanism is referred to in this document\
    \ as \"RID\n   callback\".  When performing RID callback, a responding system\
    \ MUST\n   connect to the network- and transport-layer addresses from which the\n\
    \   original request was sent; there is no mechanism in RID for\n   redirected\
    \ callback.\n   While a RID system SHOULD return the reply in an HTTP Response\
    \ if it\n   is available immediately or within a generally accepted HTTP client\n\
    \   timeout (about thirty seconds), this is not mandatory, and as such\n   RID\
    \ systems MUST be prepared for a query to be met with a 202\n   Accepted, an empty\
    \ Response body, a connection termination, and a\n   callback.  Note that all\
    \ RID messages require a response from the\n   receiving RID system, so a sending\
    \ RID system can expect either an\n   immediate response or a callback.\n   RID\
    \ systems accepting a callback message in an HTTP Request MUST\n   return 202\
    \ Accepted.\n   Table 1 lists the allowable request/response pairs for RID.\n\

    \                                  Table 1\n   For security purposes, RID systems\
    \ SHOULD NOT return 3xx Redirection\n   response codes, and MUST NOT follow any\
    \ 3xx Redirection.  When a RID\n   system's address changes, contact point information\
    \ within the\n   consortium must be updated out of band.\n   If a RID system receives\
    \ an improper RID message in an HTTP Request,\n   it MUST return an appropriate\
    \ 4xx Client Error result code to the\n   requesting RID system.  If a RID system\
    \ cannot process a RID message\n   received in an HTTP Request due to an error\
    \ on its own side, it MUST\n   return an appropriate 5xx Server Error result code\
    \ to the requesting\n   RID system.\n   Note that HTTP provides no mechanism for\
    \ signaling to a server that a\n   response body is not a valid RID message. \
    \ If a RID system receives\n   an improper RID message in an HTTP Response, or\
    \ cannot process a RID\n   message received in an HTTP Response due to an error\
    \ on its own side,\n   it MUST log the error and present it to the RID system\
    \ administrator\n   for handling; the error logging format is an implementation\
    \ detail\n   and is considered out of scope for this specification.\n   RID systems\
    \ MUST support and SHOULD use HTTP/1.1 persistent\n   connections as described\
    \ in [RFC2616].  RID systems MUST support\n   chunked transfer encoding on the\
    \ HTTP server side to allow the\n   implementation of clients that do not need\
    \ to precalculate message\n   sizes before constructing HTTP headers.\n   RID\
    \ systems MUST use TLS for confidentiality, identification, and\n   strong mutual\
    \ authentication as in [RFC2818]; see Section 4 below for\n   details.\n"
- title: 4.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "4.  Security Considerations\n   All security considerations of related documents\
    \ MUST be considered,\n   especially the Incident Object Description Exchange\
    \ Format (IODEF)\n   [RFC5070] and Real-time Inter-network Defense (RID) [RFC6045].\
    \  The\n   transport described herein is built on the foundation of these\n  \
    \ documents; the security considerations contained therein are\n   incorporated\
    \ by reference.\n   For transport confidentiality, identification, and authentication,\n\
    \   TLS with mutual authentication MUST be used to secure the HTTP\n   connection\
    \ as in [RFC2818].  The session MUST use non-NULL\n   ciphersuites for authentication,\
    \ integrity, and confidentiality;\n   sessions MAY be renegotiated within these\
    \ constraints.  Although TLS\n   implementations typically support the older Secure\
    \ Socket Layer (SSL)\n   protocol, a RID peer MUST NOT request, offer, or use\
    \ SSL 2.0, due to\n   known security vulnerabilities in this protocol; see Appendix\
    \ E of\n   [RFC5246] for more.\n   Each RID consortium SHOULD use a trusted public\
    \ key infrastructure\n   (PKI) to manage identities for RID systems participating\
    \ in TLS\n   connections.  At minimum, each RID system MUST trust a set of X.509\n\
    \   Issuer identities (\"Certificate Authorities\") [RFC5280] to directly\n  \
    \ authenticate RID system peers with which it is willing to exchange\n   information,\
    \ and/or a specific white list of X.509 Subject identities\n   of RID system peers.\n\
    \   RID systems MUST provide for the verification of the identity of a\n   RID\
    \ system peer presenting a valid and trusted certificate, by\n   verifying the\
    \ fully qualified domain name or other network-layer\n   identifier against that\
    \ stored in the certificate, if available.\n   More information on best practices\
    \ in peer identity verification is\n   available in [TLS-SERVER-ID].\n"
- title: 5.  IANA Considerations
  contents:
  - "5.  IANA Considerations\n   Consistent with BCP 56 [RFC3205], since RID over\
    \ HTTP/TLS is a\n   substantially new service, and should be controlled at the\
    \ consortium\n   member network's border differently than HTTP/TLS, it requires\
    \ a new\n   port number.  IANA has assigned port 4590/tcp to RID with the service\n\
    \   name RID over HTTP/TLS.\n"
