- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   This document specifies a simple mechanism called the Intra-Site\n\
    \   Automatic Tunnel Addressing Protocol (ISATAP) that connects\n   dual-stack\
    \ (IPv6/IPv4) nodes over IPv4 networks.  Dual-stack nodes\n   use ISATAP to automatically\
    \ tunnel IPv6 packets in IPv4, i.e., ISATAP\n   views the IPv4 network as a link\
    \ layer for IPv6.\n   ISATAP enables automatic tunneling whether global or private\
    \ IPv4\n   addresses are used, and it presents a Non-Broadcast Multiple Access\n\
    \   (NBMA) abstraction similar to [RFC2491],[RFC2492],[RFC2529], and\n   [RFC3056].\n\
    \   The main objectives of this document are to: 1) describe the domain\n   of\
    \ applicability, 2) specify addressing requirements, 3) specify\n   automatic\
    \ tunneling using ISATAP, 4) specify the operation of IPv6\n   Neighbor Discovery\
    \ over ISATAP interfaces, and 5) discuss Site\n   Administration, Security, and\
    \ IANA considerations.\n"
- title: 2.  Requirements
  contents:
  - "2.  Requirements\n   The keywords MUST, MUST NOT, REQUIRED, SHALL, SHALL NOT,\
    \ SHOULD,\n   SHOULD NOT, RECOMMENDED, MAY, and OPTIONAL, when they appear in\
    \ this\n   document, are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].\n   This\
    \ document also uses internal conceptual variables to describe\n   protocol behavior\
    \ and external variables that an implementation must\n   allow system administrators\
    \ to change.  The specific variable names,\n   how their values change, and how\
    \ their settings influence protocol\n   behavior are provided in order to demonstrate\
    \ protocol behavior.  An\n   implementation is not required to have them in the\
    \ exact form\n   described here, as long as its external behavior is consistent\
    \ with\n   that described in this document.\n"
- title: 3.  Terminology
  contents:
  - "3.  Terminology\n   The terminology of [RFC2460] and [RFC4861] applies to this\
    \ document.\n   The following additional terms are defined:\n   ISATAP node/host/router:\n\
    \      A dual-stack (IPv6/IPv4) node/host/router that implements the\n      specifications\
    \ in this document.\n   ISATAP interface:\n      An ISATAP node's Non-Broadcast\
    \ Multi-Access (NBMA) IPv6 interface,\n      used for automatic tunneling of IPv6\
    \ packets in IPv4.\n   ISATAP interface identifier:\n      An IPv6 interface identifier\
    \ with an embedded IPv4 address\n      constructed as specified in Section 6.1.\n\
    \   ISATAP address:\n      An IPv6 unicast address that matches an on-link prefix\
    \ on an\n      ISATAP interface of the node, and that includes an ISATAP\n   \
    \   interface identifier.\n   locator:\n      An IPv4 address-to-interface mapping;\
    \ i.e., a node's IPv4 address\n      and its associated interface.\n   locator\
    \ set:\n      A set of locators associated with an ISATAP interface.  Each\n \
    \     locator in the set belongs to the same site.\n"
- title: 4.  Domain of Applicability
  contents:
  - "4.  Domain of Applicability\n   The domain of applicability for this technical\
    \ specification is\n   automatic tunneling of IPv6 packets in IPv4 for ISATAP\
    \ nodes within\n   sites that observe the security considerations found in this\n\
    \   document, including host-to-router, router-to-host, and host-to-host\n   automatic\
    \ tunneling in certain enterprise networks and 3GPP/3GPP2\n   wireless operator\
    \ networks.  (Other scenarios with a sufficient trust\n   basis ensured by the\
    \ mechanisms specified in this document also fall\n   within this domain of applicability.)\n\
    \   Extensions to the above domain of applicability (e.g., by combining\n   the\
    \ mechanisms in this document with those in other technical\n   specifications)\
    \ are out of the scope of this document.\n"
- title: 5.  Node Requirements
  contents:
  - "5.  Node Requirements\n   ISATAP nodes observe the common functionality requirements\
    \ for IPv6\n   nodes found in [RFC4294] and the requirements for dual IP layer\n\
    \   operation found in Section 2 of [RFC4213].  They also implement the\n   additional\
    \ features specified in this document.\n"

- title: 6.1.  ISATAP Interface Identifiers
  contents:
  - "6.1.  ISATAP Interface Identifiers\n   ISATAP interface identifiers are constructed\
    \ in Modified EUI-64\n   format per Section 2.5.1 of [RFC4291] by concatenating\
    \ the 24-bit\n   IANA OUI (00-00-5E), the 8-bit hexadecimal value 0xFE, and a\
    \ 32-bit\n   IPv4 address in network byte order as follows:\n   |0           \
    \   1|1              3|3                              6|\n   |0              5|6\
    \              1|2                              3|\n   +----------------+----------------+--------------------------------+\n\
    \   |000000ug00000000|0101111011111110|mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm|\n   +----------------+----------------+--------------------------------+\n\
    \   When the IPv4 address is known to be globally unique, the \"u\" bit\n   (universal/local)\
    \ is set to 1; otherwise, the \"u\" bit is set to 0.\n   \"g\" is the individual/group\
    \ bit, and \"m\" represents the bits of the\n   IPv4 address.\n   Per Section\
    \ 2.5.1 of [RFC4291], ISATAP nodes are not required to\n   validate that interface\
    \ identifiers created with modified EUI-64\n   tokens with the \"u\" bit set to\
    \ universal are unique.\n"
- title: 6.2.  ISATAP Interface Address Configuration
  contents:
  - "6.2.  ISATAP Interface Address Configuration\n   Each ISATAP interface configures\
    \ a set of locators consisting of IPv4\n   address-to-interface mappings from\
    \ a single site; i.e., an ISATAP\n   interface's locator set MUST NOT span multiple\
    \ sites.\n   When an IPv4 address is removed from an interface, the corresponding\n\
    \   locator SHOULD be removed from its associated locator set(s).  When a\n  \
    \ new IPv4 address is assigned to an interface, the corresponding\n   locator\
    \ MAY be added to the appropriate locator set(s).\n   ISATAP interfaces form ISATAP\
    \ interface identifiers from IPv4\n   addresses in their locator set and use them\
    \ to create link-local\n   ISATAP addresses (Section 5.3 of [RFC4862]).\n"
- title: 6.3.  Multicast/Anycast
  contents:
  - "6.3.  Multicast/Anycast\n   It is not possible to assume the general availability\
    \ of wide-area\n   IPv4 multicast, so (unlike 6over4 [RFC2529]) ISATAP must assume\
    \ that\n   its underlying IPv4 carrier network only has unicast capability.\n\
    \   Support for IPv6 multicast over ISATAP interfaces is not described in\n  \
    \ this document.\n   Similarly, support for Reserved IPv6 Subnet Anycast Addresses\
    \ is not\n   described in this document.\n"
- title: 7.  Automatic Tunneling
  contents:
  - "7.  Automatic Tunneling\n   ISATAP interfaces use the basic tunneling mechanisms\
    \ specified in\n   Section 3 of [RFC4213].  The following sub-sections describe\n\
    \   additional specifications.\n"
- title: 7.1.  Encapsulation
  contents:
  - "7.1.  Encapsulation\n   ISATAP addresses are mapped to a link-layer address by\
    \ a static\n   computation; i.e., the last four octets are treated as an IPv4\n\
    \   address.\n"
- title: 7.2.  Handling ICMPv4 Errors
  contents:
  - "7.2.  Handling ICMPv4 Errors\n   ISATAP interfaces SHOULD process Address Resolution\
    \ Protocol (ARP)\n   failures and persistent ICMPv4 errors as link-specific information\n\
    \   indicating that a path to a neighbor may have failed (Section 7.3.3\n   of\
    \ [RFC4861]).\n"
- title: 7.3.  Decapsulation
  contents:
  - "7.3.  Decapsulation\n   The specification in Section 3.6 of [RFC4213] is used.\
    \  Additionally,\n   when an ISATAP node receives an IPv4 protocol 41 datagram\
    \ that does\n   not belong to a configured tunnel interface, it determines whether\n\
    \   the packet's IPv4 destination address and arrival interface match a\n   locator\
    \ configured in an ISATAP interface's locator set.\n   If an ISATAP interface\
    \ that configures a matching locator is found,\n   the decapsulator MUST verify\
    \ that the packet's IPv4 source address is\n   correct for the encapsulated IPv6\
    \ source address.  The IPv4 source\n   address is correct if:\n      o  the IPv6\
    \ source address is an ISATAP address that embeds the\n         IPv4 source address\
    \ in its interface identifier, or\n      o  the IPv4 source address is a member\
    \ of the Potential Router\n         List (see Section 8.1).\n   Packets for which\
    \ the IPv4 source address is incorrect for this\n   ISATAP interface are checked\
    \ to determine whether they belong to\n   another tunnel interface.\n"
- title: 7.4.  Link-Local Addresses
  contents:
  - "7.4.  Link-Local Addresses\n   ISATAP interfaces use link-local addresses constructed\
    \ as specified\n   in Section 6 of this document.\n"
- title: 7.5.  Neighbor Discovery over Tunnels
  contents:
  - "7.5.  Neighbor Discovery over Tunnels\n   ISATAP interfaces use the specifications\

- title: 10.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "10.  Security Considerations\n   Implementers should be aware that, in addition\
    \ to possible attacks\n   against IPv6, security attacks against IPv4 must also\
    \ be considered.\n   Use of IP security at both IPv4 and IPv6 levels should nevertheless\n\
    \   be avoided, for efficiency reasons.  For example, if IPv6 is running\n   encrypted,\
    \ encryption of IPv4 would be redundant unless traffic\n   analysis is felt to\
    \ be a threat.  If IPv6 is running authenticated,\n   then authentication of IPv4\
    \ will add little.  Conversely, IPv4\n   security will not protect IPv6 traffic\
    \ once it leaves the ISATAP\n   domain.  Therefore, implementing IPv6 security\
    \ is required even if\n   IPv4 security is available.\n   The threats associated\
    \ with IPv6 Neighbor Discovery are described in\n   [RFC3756].\n   There is a\
    \ possible spoofing attack in which spurious ip-protocol-41\n   packets are injected\
    \ into an ISATAP link from outside.  Since an\n   ISATAP link spans an entire\
    \ IPv4 site, restricting access to the link\n   can be achieved by restricting\
    \ access to the site; i.e., by having\n   site border routers implement IPv4 ingress\
    \ filtering and ip-\n   protocol-41 filtering.\n   Another possible spoofing attack\
    \ involves spurious ip-protocol-41\n   packets injected from within an ISATAP\
    \ link by a node pretending to\n   be a router.  The Potential Router List (PRL)\
    \ provides a list of IPv4\n   addresses representing advertising ISATAP interfaces\
    \ of routers that\n   hosts use in filtering decisions.  Site administrators should\
    \ ensure\n   that the PRL is kept up to date, and that the resolution mechanism\n\
    \   (see Section 9) cannot be subverted.\n   The use of temporary addresses [RFC4941]\
    \ and Cryptographically\n   Generated Addresses [RFC3972] on ISATAP interfaces\
    \ is outside the\n   scope of this specification.\n"

    \      Block\n   Modified EUI-64 addresses (Section 2.5.1 and Appendix A of [RFC4291])\n\
    \   in the IANA Ethernet Address Block are formed by concatenating the\n   24-bit\
    \ IANA OUI (00-00-5E) with a 40-bit extension identifier and\n   inverting the\
    \ \"u\" bit; i.e., the \"u\" bit is set to one (1) to\n   indicate universal scope\
    \ and set to zero (0) to indicate local scope.\n   Modified EUI-64 addresses have\
    \ the following appearance in memory\n   (bits transmitted right-to-left within\
    \ octets, octets transmitted\n   left-to-right):\n   0                       23\
