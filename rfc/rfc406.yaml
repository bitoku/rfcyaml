  - "                    Scheduled IMP Software Releases\n     This note is a reminder\
    \ that the procedures suggested in\nbeen in effect for a period of about two months.\
    \  Two points\napparently require re-emphasis:\n     1)   We reserve the hour\
    \ from 7 to 8 a.m. eastern time\nevery Tuesday as the time when IMPs can be reloaded.\
    \  We will\nprobably not use this period every Tuesday, but we do reserve\nthis\
    \ period every Tuesday.  The software maintenance time period\nis in addition\
    \ to the hardware preventive maintenance scheduled\nat each site.\n     2)   We\
    \ now send an IMP - Going - Down message to all\nthe Hosts at the site which contains\
    \ information on the time\nthat the IMP is going down, the expected duration,\
    \ and the\nreason.  We try to send out this message an hour before soft-\nware\
    \ releases, and five to ten minutes before scheduled pre-\nventive maintenance.\
    \  Further, we will also notify the Hosts\nat a site, whenever possible, when\
    \ it is necessary to stop the\nIMP on an unscheduled basis.  Finally, 30 seconds\
    \ before the\nimmediately.  The format of the IMP - Going - Down message\nis as\
    \ follows:\nbits 1 - 4  -  all zero\nbits 5 - 8  -  0010\nbits 9 - 16 -  all zero\n\
    bits 17 - 32 -  coded as follows:\n          All bits zero - going down in 30\
    \ seconds\n          Bits 17, 18 = 01 - scheduled hardware PM\n          Bits\
    \ 17, 18 = 10 - scheduled software reload\n          Bits 17, 18 = 11 - emergency\
    \ reload on restart\n          Bits 19 - 22 - how soon the IMP is going down,\n\
    \                         in 5 minute units.\n          Bits 23 - 32 - how long\
    \ the IMP will be down, in\n                         5 minute units.\n    [ This\
    \ RFC was put into machine readable form for entry ]\n    [ into the online RFC\
    \ archives by BBN Corp. under the   ]\n    [ direction of Alex McKenzie.     \
