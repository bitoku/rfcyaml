  - "1.  Introduction\n   A management system contains:  several (potentially many)\
    \ nodes, each\n   with a processing entity, termed an agent, which has access\
    \ to\n   management instrumentation; at least one management station; and, a\n\
    \   management protocol, used to convey management information between\n   the\
    \ agents and management stations.  Operations of the protocol are\n   carried\
    \ out under an administrative framework which defines\n   authentication, authorization,\
    \ access control, and privacy policies.\n   Management stations execute management\
    \ applications which monitor and\n   control managed elements.  Managed elements\
    \ are devices such as\n   hosts, routers, terminal servers, etc., which are monitored\
    \ and\n   controlled via access to their management information.\n   Management\
    \ information is viewed as a collection of managed objects,\n   residing in a\
    \ virtual information store, termed the Management\n   Information Base (MIB).\
    \  Collections of related objects are defined\n   in MIB modules.  These modules\
    \ are written using a subset of OSI's\n   Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1)\
    \ [1], termed the Structure of\n   Management Information (SMI) [2].\n   The management\
    \ protocol, SNMPv2 [3], provides for the exchange of\n   messages which convey\
    \ management information between the agents and\n   the management stations. \
    \ It is the purpose of this document to\n   define managed objects which describe\
    \ the behavior of a SNMPv2\n   entity.\n"

    \   15), and 1212 (STD 16), is termed the SNMP version 1 framework\n   (SNMPv1).\
