  - "1.  Introduction\n   Constrained devices (also known as sensors, smart objects,\
    \ or smart\n   devices) with limited CPU, memory, and power resources can be\n\
    \   connected to a network.  Such a network of constrained devices itself\n  \
    \ may be constrained or challenged, e.g., with unreliable or lossy\n   channels,\
    \ wireless technologies with limited bandwidth and a dynamic\n   topology, needing\
    \ the service of a gateway or proxy to connect to the\n   Internet.  In other\
    \ scenarios, the constrained devices can be\n   connected to a unconstrained network\
    \ using off-the-shelf protocol\n   stacks.  Constrained devices might be in charge\
    \ of gathering\n   information in diverse settings including natural ecosystems,\n\
    \   buildings, and factories and sending the information to one or more\n   server\
    \ stations.\n   Network management is characterized by monitoring network status,\n\
    \   detecting faults (and inferring their causes), setting network\n   parameters,\
    \ and carrying out actions to remove faults, maintain\n   normal operation, and\
    \ improve network efficiency and application\n   performance.  The traditional\
    \ network management application\n   periodically collects information from a\
    \ set of managed network\n   elements, it processes the collected data, and it\
    \ presents the\n   results to the network management users.  Constrained devices,\n\
    \   however, often have limited power, have low transmission range, and\n   might\
    \ be unreliable.  Such unreliability might arise from device\n   itself (e.g.,\
    \ battery exhausted) or from the channel being\n   constrained (i.e., low-capacity\
    \ and high-latency).  They might also\n   need to work in hostile environments\
    \ with advanced security\n   requirements or need to be used in harsh environments\
    \ for a long time\n   without supervision.  Due to such constraints, the management\
    \ of a\n   network with constrained devices offers different types of challenges\n\
    \   compared to the management of a traditional IP network.\n   This document\
    \ aims to understand use cases for the management of a\n   network in which constrained\
    \ devices are involved.  It lists and\n   discusses diverse use cases for management\
    \ from the network as well\n   as from the application point of view.  The list\
    \ of discussed use\n   cases is not an exhaustive one since other scenarios, currently\n\
    \   unknown to the authors, are possible.  The application scenarios\n   discussed\
    \ aim to show where networks of constrained devices are\n   expected to be deployed.\
    \  For each application scenario, we first\n   briefly describe the characteristics\
    \ followed by a discussion on how\n   network management can be provided, who\
    \ is likely going to be\n   responsible for it, and on which time-scale management\
    \ operations are\n   likely to be carried out.\n   A problem statement, deployment\
    \ and management topology options as\n   well as the requirements on the networks\
    \ with constrained devices can\n   be found in the companion document [RFC7547].\n\
    \   This documents builds on the terminology defined in [RFC7228] and\n   [RFC7547].\
    \  [RFC7228] is a base document for the terminology\n   concerning constrained\
    \ devices and constrained networks.  Some use\n   cases specific to IPv6 over\
    \ Low-Power Wireless Personal Area Networks\n   (6LoWPANs) can be found in [RFC6568].\n"
- title: 2.  Access Technologies
  contents:
  - "2.  Access Technologies\n   Besides the management requirements imposed by the\
    \ different use\n   cases, the access technologies used by constrained devices\
    \ can impose\n   restrictions and requirements upon the Network Management System\n\
    \   (NMS) and protocol of choice.\n   It is possible that some networks of constrained\
    \ devices might\n   utilize traditional unconstrained access technologies for\
    \ network\n   access, e.g., local area networks with plenty of capacity.  In such\n\
    \   scenarios, the constrainedness of the device presents special\n   management\
    \ restrictions and requirements rather than the access\n   technology utilized.\n\
    \   However, in other situations, constrained or cellular access\n   technologies\
    \ might be used for network access, thereby causing\n   management restrictions\
    \ and requirements to arise as a result of the\n   underlying access technologies.\n\
    \   A discussion regarding the impact of cellular and constrained access\n   technologies\
    \ is provided in this section since they impose some\n   special requirements\
    \ on the management of constrained networks.  On\n   the other hand, fixed-line\
    \ networks (e.g., power-line communications)\n   are not discussed here since\
    \ tend to be quite static and do not\n   typically impose any special requirements\
    \ on the management of the\n   network.\n"
- title: 2.1.  Constrained Access Technologies
  contents:
  - "2.1.  Constrained Access Technologies\n   Due to resource restrictions, embedded\
    \ devices deployed as sensors\n   and actuators in the various use cases utilize\
    \ low-power, low-data-\n   rate wireless access technologies such as [IEEE802.15.4],\
    \ Digital\n   Enhanced Cordless Telecommunication (DECT) Ultra Low Energy (ULE),\
    \ or\n   Bluetooth Low-Energy (BT-LE) for network connectivity.\n   In such scenarios,\
    \ it is important for the NMS to be aware of the\n   restrictions imposed by these\
    \ access technologies to efficiently\n   manage these constrained devices.  Specifically,\
    \ such low-power, low-\n   data-rate access technologies typically have small\
    \ frame sizes.  So\n   it would be important for the NMS and management protocol\
    \ of choice\n   to craft packets in a way that avoids fragmentation and reassembly\
    \ of\n   packets since this can use valuable memory on constrained devices.\n\
    \   Devices using such access technologies might operate via a gateway\n   that\
    \ translates between these access technologies and more\n   traditional Internet\
    \ protocols.  A hierarchical approach to device\n   management in such a situation\
    \ might be useful, wherein the gateway\n   device is in-charge of devices connected\
    \ to it, while the NMS\n   conducts management operations only to the gateway.\n"
- title: 2.2.  Cellular Access Technologies
  contents:
  - "2.2.  Cellular Access Technologies\n   Machine-to-machine (M2M) services are\
    \ increasingly provided by mobile\n   service providers as numerous devices, home\
    \ appliances, utility\n   meters, cars, video surveillance cameras, and health\
    \ monitors are\n   connected with mobile broadband technologies.  Different\n\
    \   applications, e.g., in a home appliance or in-car network, use\n   Bluetooth,\
    \ Wi-Fi, or ZigBee locally and connect to a cellular module\n   acting as a gateway\
    \ between the constrained environment and the\n   mobile cellular network.\n \
    \  Such a gateway might provide different options for the connectivity\n   of\
    \ mobile networks and constrained devices:\n   o  a smartphone with 3G/4G and\
    \ WLAN radio might use BT-LE to connect\n      to the devices in a home area network,\n\
    \   o  a femtocell might be combined with home gateway functionality\n      acting\
    \ as a low-power cellular base station connecting smart\n      devices to the\
    \ application server of a mobile service provider,\n   o  an embedded cellular\
    \ module with LTE radio connecting the devices\n      in the car network with\
    \ the server running the telematics service,\n   o  an M2M gateway connected to\
    \ the mobile operator network supporting\n      diverse Internet of Things (IoT)\
    \ connectivity technologies\n      including ZigBee and Constrained Application\
    \ Protocol (CoAP) over\n      6LoWPAN over IEEE 802.15.4.\n   Common to all scenarios\
    \ above is that they are embedded in a service\n   and connected to a network\
    \ provided by a mobile service provider.\n   Usually, there is a hierarchical\
    \ deployment and management topology\n   in place where different parts of the\
    \ network are managed by\n   different management entities and the count of devices\
    \ to manage is\n   high (e.g., many thousands).  In general, the network is comprised\
    \ of\n   manifold types and sizes of devices matching to different device\n  \
    \ classes.  As such, the managing entity needs to be prepared to manage\n   devices\
    \ with diverse capabilities using different communication or\n   management protocols.\
    \  In the case in which the devices are directly\n   connected to a gateway, they\
    \ most likely are managed by a management\n   entity integrated with the gateway,\
    \ which itself is part of the NMS\n   run by the mobile operator.  Smartphones\
    \ or embedded modules\n   connected to a gateway might themselves be in charge\
    \ of managing the\n   devices on their level.  The initial and subsequent configuration\
    \ of\n   such a device is mainly based on self-configuration and is triggered\n\
    \   by the device itself.\n   The gateway might be in charge of filtering and\
    \ aggregating the data\n   received from the device as the information sent by\
    \ the device might\n   be mostly redundant.\n"

  contents:
  - "3.  Device Life Cycle\n   Since constrained devices deployed in a network might\
    \ go through\n   multiple phases in their lifetime, it is possible for different\n\
    \   managers of networks and/or devices to exist during different parts\n   of\
    \ the device lifetimes.  An in-depth discussion regarding the\n   possible device\
    \ life cycles can be found in [IOT-SEC].\n"
- title: 3.1.  Manufacturing and Initial Testing
  contents:
  - "3.1.  Manufacturing and Initial Testing\n   Typically, the life cycle of a device\
    \ begins at the manufacturing\n   stage.  During this phase, the manufacturer\
    \ of the device is\n   responsible for the management and configuration of the\
    \ devices.  It\n   is also possible that a certain use case might utilize multiple\
    \ types\n   of constrained devices (e.g., temperature sensors, lighting\n   controllers,\
    \ etc.) and these could be manufactured by different\n   entities.  As such, during\
    \ the manufacturing stage, different\n   managers can exist for different devices.\
    \  Similarly, during the\n   initial testing phase, where device quality-assurance\
    \ tasks might be\n   performed, the manufacturer remains responsible for the management\
    \ of\n   devices and networks that might comprise them.\n"
- title: 3.2.  Installation and Configuration
  contents:
  - "3.2.  Installation and Configuration\n   The responsibility of managing the devices\
    \ must be transferred to the\n   installer during the installation phase.  There\
    \ must exist procedures\n   for transferring management responsibility between\
    \ the manufacturer\n   and installer.  The installer may be the customer or an\
    \ intermediary\n   contracted to set up the devices and their networks.  It is\
    \ important\n   that the NMS that is utilized allows devices originating at different\n\
    \   vendors to be managed, ensuring interoperability between them and the\n  \
    \ configuration of trust relationships between them as well.\n   It is possible\
    \ that the installation and configuration\n   responsibilities might lie with\
    \ different entities.  For example, the\n   installer of a device might only be\
    \ responsible for cabling a\n   network, physically installing the devices, and\
    \ ensuring initial\n   network connectivity between them (e.g., configuring IP\
    \ addresses).\n   Following such an installation, the customer or a subcontractor\
    \ might\n   actually configure the operation of the device.  As such, during\n\
    \   installation and configuration multiple parties might be responsible\n   for\
    \ managing a device and appropriate methods must be available to\n   ensure that\
    \ this management responsibility is transferred suitably.\n"
- title: 3.3.  Operation and Maintenance
  contents:
  - "3.3.  Operation and Maintenance\n   At the outset of the operation phase, the\
    \ operational responsibility\n   of a device and network should be passed on to\
    \ the customer.  It is\n   possible that the customer, however, might contract\
    \ the maintenance\n   of the devices and network to a subcontractor.  In this\
    \ case, the NMS\n   and management protocol should allow for configuring different\
    \ levels\n   of access to the devices.  Since different maintenance vendors might\n\
    \   be used for devices that perform different functions (e.g., HVAC,\n   lighting,\
    \ etc.), it should also be possible to restrict management\n   access to devices\
    \ based on the currently responsible manager.\n"
- title: 3.4.  Recommissioning and Decommissioning
  contents:
  - "3.4.  Recommissioning and Decommissioning\n   The owner of a device might choose\
    \ to replace, repurpose, or even\n   decommission it.  In each of these cases,\
    \ either the customer or the\n   contracted maintenance agency must ensure that\
    \ appropriate steps are\n   taken to meet the end goal.\n   In case the devices\
    \ needs to be replaced, the manager of the network\n   (customer or contractor\
    \ responsible) must detach the device from the\n   network, remove all appropriate\
    \ configuration, and discard the\n   device.  A new device must then be configured\
    \ to replace it.  The NMS\n   should allow for the transferring of the configuration\
    \ and replacing\n   an existing device.  The management responsibility of the\
    \ operation/\n   maintenance manager would end once the device is removed from\
    \ the\n   network.  During the installation of the new replacement device, the\n\
    \   same responsibilities would apply as those during the Installation\n   and\
    \ Configuration phases.\n   The device being replaced may not have yet reached\
    \ end-of-life, and\n   as such, instead of being discarded, it may be installed\
    \ in a new\n   location.  In this case, the management responsibilities are once\n\
    \   again resting in the hands of the entities responsible for the\n   Installation\
    \ and Configuration phases at the new location.\n   If a device is repurposed,\
    \ then it is possible that the management\n   responsibility for this device changes\
    \ as well.  For example, a\n   device might be moved from one building to another.\
    \  In this case,\n   the managers responsible for devices and networks in each\
    \ building\n   could be different.  As such, the NMS must not only allow for\n\
    \   changing configuration but also the transferring of management\n   responsibilities.\n\
    \   In case a device is decommissioned, the management responsibility\n   typically\
    \ ends at that point.\n"

- title: 4.1.  Environmental Monitoring
  contents:
  - "4.1.  Environmental Monitoring\n   Environmental monitoring applications are\
    \ characterized by the\n   deployment of a number of sensors to monitor emissions,\
    \ water\n   quality, or even the movements and habits of wildlife.  Other\n  \
    \ applications in this category include earthquake or tsunami early-\n   warning\
    \ systems.  The sensors often span a large geographic area;\n   they can be mobile;\
    \ and they are often difficult to replace.\n   Furthermore, the sensors are usually\
    \ not protected against tampering.\n   Management of environmental-monitoring\
    \ applications is largely\n   concerned with monitoring whether the system is\
    \ still functional and\n   the roll out of new constrained devices in case the\
    \ system loses too\n   much of its structure.  The constrained devices themselves\
    \ need to be\n   able to establish connectivity (autoconfiguration), and they\
    \ need to\n   be able to deal with events such as losing neighbors or being moved\n\
    \   to other locations.\n   Management responsibility typically rests with the\
    \ organization\n   running the environmental-monitoring application.  Since these\n\
    \   monitoring applications must be designed to tolerate a number of\n   failures,\
    \ the time scale for detecting and recording failures is, for\n   some of these\
    \ applications, likely measured in hours and repairs\n   might easily take days.\
    \  In fact, in some scenarios it might be more\n   cost- and time-effective not\
    \ to repair such devices at all.  However,\n   for certain environmental monitoring\
    \ applications, much tighter time\n   scales may exist and might be enforced by\
    \ regulations (e.g.,\n   monitoring of nuclear radiation).\n   Since many applications\
    \ of environmental-monitoring sensors are\n   likely to be in areas that are important\
    \ to safety (flood monitoring,\n   nuclear radiation monitoring, etc.), it is\
    \ important for management\n   protocols and NMSs to ensure appropriate security\
    \ protections.  These\n   protections include not only access control, integrity,\
    \ and\n   availability of data, but also provide appropriate mechanisms that\n\
    \   can deal with situations that might be categorized as emergencies or\n   when\
    \ tampering with sensors/data might be detected.\n"
- title: 4.2.  Infrastructure Monitoring
  contents:
  - "4.2.  Infrastructure Monitoring\n   Infrastructure monitoring is concerned with\
    \ the monitoring of\n   infrastructures such as bridges, railway tracks, or (offshore)\n\
    \   windmills.  The primary goal is usually to detect any events or\n   changes\
    \ of the structural conditions that can impact the risk and\n   safety of the\
    \ infrastructure being monitored.  Another secondary goal\n   is to schedule repair\
    \ and maintenance activities in a cost-effective\n   manner.\n   The infrastructure\
    \ to monitor might be in a factory or spread over a\n   wider area (but difficult\
    \ to access).  As such, the network in use\n   might be based on a combination\
    \ of fixed and wireless technologies,\n   which use robust networking equipment\
    \ and support reliable\n   communication via application-layer transactions. \
    \ It is likely that\n   constrained devices in such a network are mainly C2 devices\
    \ [RFC7228]\n   and have to be controlled centrally by an application running\
    \ on a\n   server.  In case such a distributed network is widely spread, the\n\
    \   wireless devices might use diverse long-distance wireless\n   technologies\
    \ such as Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access\n   (WiMAX) or 3G/LTE.\
    \  In cases, where an in-building network is\n   involved, the network can be\
    \ based on Ethernet or wireless\n   technologies suitable for in-building use.\n\
    \   The management of infrastructure monitoring applications is primarily\n  \
    \ concerned with the monitoring of the functioning of the system.\n   Infrastructure\
    \ monitoring devices are typically rolled out and\n   installed by dedicated experts,\
    \ and updates are rare since the\n   infrastructure itself does not change often.\
    \  However, monitoring\n   devices are often deployed in unsupervised environments;\
    \ hence,\n   special attention must be given to protecting the devices from being\n\
    \   modified.\n   Management responsibility typically rests with the organization\n\
    \   owning the infrastructure or responsible for its operation.  The time\n  \
    \ scale for detecting and recording failures is likely measured in\n   hours and\
    \ repairs might easily take days.  However, certain events\n   (e.g., natural\
    \ disasters) may require that status information be\n   obtained much more quickly\
    \ and that replacements of failed sensors\n   can be rolled out quickly (or redundant\
    \ sensors are activated\n   quickly).  In case the devices are difficult to access,\
    \ a self-\n   healing feature on the device might become necessary.  Since\n \
    \  infrastructure monitoring is closely related to ensuring safety,\n   management\
    \ protocols and systems must provide appropriate security\n   protections to ensure\
    \ confidentiality, integrity, and availability of\n   data.\n"

    \ data systems used by collaborating divisions or\n   business systems.  Intelligent\
    \ automation and learning systems are\n   vital to smart manufacturing, but they\
    \ must be effectively integrated\n   with the decision environment.  The NMS utilized\
    \ must ensure timely\n   delivery of sensor data to the control unit so it may\
    \ take\n   appropriate decisions.  Similarly, the relaying of commands must also\n\
    \   be monitored and managed to ensure optimal functioning.  Wireless\n   sensor\
    \ networks (WSNs) have been developed for machinery Condition-\n   based Maintenance\
    \ (CBM) as they offer significant cost savings and\n   enable new functionalities.\
    \  Inaccessible locations, rotating\n   machinery, hazardous areas, and mobile\
    \ assets can be reached with\n   wireless sensors.  Today, WSNs can provide wireless\
    \ link reliability,\n   real-time capabilities, and quality-of-service and they\
    \ can enable\n   industrial and related wireless sense and control applications.\n\
    \   Management of industrial and factory applications is largely focused\n   on\
    \ monitoring whether the system is still functional, real-time\n   continuous\
    \ performance monitoring, and optimization as necessary.\n   The factory network\
    \ might be part of a campus network or connected to\n   the Internet.  The constrained\
    \ devices in such a network need to be\n   able to establish configuration themselves\
    \ (autoconfiguration) and\n   might need to deal with error conditions as much\
    \ as possible locally.\n   Access control has to be provided with multi-level\
    \ administrative\n   access and security.  Support and diagnostics can be provided\
    \ through\n   remote monitoring access centralized outside of the factory.\n \
    \  Factory-automation tasks require that continuous monitoring be used\n   to\
    \ optimize production.  Groups of manufacturing and monitoring\n   devices could\
    \ be defined to establish relationships between them.  To\n   ensure timely optimization\
    \ of processes, commands from the NMS must\n   arrive at all destination within\
    \ an appropriate duration.  This\n   duration could change based on the manufacturing\
    \ task being\n   performed.  Installation and operation of factory networks have\n\
    \   different requirements.  During the installation phase, many\n   networks,\
    \ usually distributed along different parts of the factory/\n   assembly line,\
    \ coexist without a connection to a common backbone.  A\n   specialized installation\
    \ tool is typically used to configure the\n   functions of different types of\
    \ devices, in different factory\n   locations, in a secure manner.  At the end\
    \ of the installation phase,\n   interoperability between these stand-alone networks\
    \ and devices must\n   be enabled.  During the operation phase, these stand-alone\
    \ networks\n   are connected to a common backbone so that they may retrieve control\n\
    \   information from and send commands to appropriate devices.\n   Management\
    \ responsibility is typically owned by the organization\n   running the industrial\
    \ application.  Since the monitoring\n   applications must handle a potentially\
    \ large number of failures, the\n   time scale for detecting and recording failures\
    \ is, for some of these\n   applications, likely measured in minutes.  However,\
    \ for certain\n   industrial applications, much tighter time scales may exist,\
    \ e.g., in\n   real-time, which might be enforced by the manufacturing process\
    \ or\n   the use of critical material.  Management protocols and NMSs must\n \
    \  ensure appropriate access control since different users of industrial\n   control\
    \ systems will have varying levels of permissions.  For\n   example, while supervisors\
    \ might be allowed to change production\n   parameters, they should not be allowed\
    \ to modify the functional\n   configuration of devices like a technician should.\
    \  It is also\n   important to ensure integrity and availability of data since\n\
    \   malfunctions can potentially become safety issues.  This also implies\n  \
    \ that management systems must be able to react to situations that may\n   pose\
    \ dangers to worker safety.\n"
- title: 4.4.  Energy Management

  - "4.4.  Energy Management\n   The EMAN working group developed an energy-management\
    \ framework\n   [RFC7326] for devices and device components within or connected\
    \ to\n   communication networks.  This document observes that one of the\n   challenges\
    \ of energy management is that a power distribution network\n   is responsible\
    \ for the supply of energy to various devices and\n   components, while a separate\
    \ communication network is typically used\n   to monitor and control the power\
    \ distribution network.  Devices in\n   the context of energy management can be\
    \ monitored for parameters like\n   power, energy, demand and power quality. \
    \ If a device contains\n   batteries, they can be also monitored and managed.\n\
    \   Energy devices differ in complexity and may include basic sensors or\n   switches,\
    \ specialized electrical meters, or power distribution units\n   (PDU), and subsystems\
    \ inside the network devices (routers, network\n   switches) or home or industrial\
    \ appliances.  The operators of an\n   energy-management system are either the\
    \ utility providers or\n   customers that aim to control and reduce the energy\
    \ consumption and\n   the associated costs.  The topology in use differs and the\
    \ deployment\n   can cover areas from small surfaces (individual homes) to large\n\
    \   geographical areas.  The EMAN requirements document [RFC6988]\n   discusses\
    \ the requirements for energy management concerning\n   monitoring and control\
    \ functions.\n   It is assumed that energy management will apply to a large range\
    \ of\n   devices of all classes and networks topologies.  Specific resource\n\
    \   monitoring, like battery utilization and availability, may be\n   specific\
    \ to devices with lower physical resources (device classes C0\n   or C1 [RFC7228]).\n\
    \   Energy management is especially relevant to the Smart Grid.  A Smart\n   Grid\
    \ is an electrical grid that uses data networks to gather and act\n   on energy\
    \ and power-related information in an automated fashion with\n   the goal to improve\
    \ the efficiency, reliability, economics, and\n   sustainability of the production\
    \ and distribution of electricity.\n   Smart Metering is a good example of an\
    \ energy-management application\n   based on Smart Grid.  Different types of possibly\
    \ wireless small\n   meters all together produce a large amount of data, which\
    \ is\n   collected by a central entity and processed by an application server,\n\
    \   which may be located within the customer's residence or off site in a\n  \
    \ data center.  The communication infrastructure can be provided by a\n   mobile\
    \ network operator as the meters in urban areas will most likely\n   have a cellular\
    \ or WiMAX radio.  In case the application server is\n   located within the residence,\
    \ such meters are more likely to use\n   Wi-Fi protocols to interconnect with\
    \ an existing network.\n   An Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) network is\
    \ another example\n   of the Smart Grid that enables an electric utility to retrieve\n\
    \   frequent electric usage data from each electric meter installed at a\n   customer's\
    \ home or business.  Unlike Smart Metering, in which case\n   the customer or\
    \ their agents install appliance-level meters, an AMI\n   is typically managed\
    \ by the utility providers and could also include\n   other distribution automation\
    \ devices like transformers and\n   reclosers.  Meters in AMI networks typically\
    \ contain constrained\n   devices that connect to mesh networks with a low-bandwidth\
    \ radio.\n   Usage data and outage notifications can be sent by these meters to\n\
    \   the utility's headend systems, via aggregation points of higher-end\n   router\
    \ devices that bridge the constrained network to a less\n   constrained network\
    \ via cellular, WiMAX, or Ethernet.  Unlike meters,\n   these higher-end devices\
    \ might be installed on utility poles owned\n   and operated by a separate entity.\n\
    \   It thereby becomes important for a management application not only to\n  \
    \ be able to work with diverse types of devices, but also to work over\n   multiple\
    \ links that might be operated and managed by separate\n   entities, each having\
    \ divergent policies for their own devices and\n   network segments.  During management\
    \ operations, like firmware\n   updates, it is important that the management systems\
    \ perform robustly\n   in order to avoid accidental outages of critical power\
    \ systems that\n   could be part of AMI networks.  In fact, since AMI networks\
    \ must also\n   report on outages, the management system might have to manage\
    \ the\n   energy properties of battery-operated AMI devices themselves as well.\n\
    \   A management system for home-based Smart Metering solutions is likely\n  \
    \ to have devices laid out in a simple topology.  However, AMI network\n   installations\
    \ could have thousands of nodes per router, i.e., higher-\n   end device, which\
    \ organize themselves in an ad hoc manner.  As such,\n   a management system for\
    \ AMI networks will need to discover and\n   operate over complex topologies as\
    \ well.  In some situations, it is\n   possible that the management system might\
    \ also have to set up and\n   manage the topology of nodes, especially critical\
    \ routers.\n   Encryption-key management and sharing in both types of networks\
    \ are\n   also likely to be important for providing confidentiality for all\n\
    \   data traffic.  In AMI networks, the key may be obtained by a meter\n   only\
    \ after an end-to-end authentication process based on\n   certificates.  The Smart\
    \ Metering solution could adopt a similar\n   approach or the security may be\
    \ implied due to the encrypted Wi-Fi\n   networks they become part of.\n   The\
    \ management of such a network requires end-to-end management of\n   and information\
    \ exchange through different types of networks.\n   However, as of today, there\
    \ is no integrated energy-management\n   approach and no common information model\
    \ available.  Specific energy-\n   management applications or network islands\
    \ use their own management\n   mechanisms.\n"

    \   exercise and empower self-monitoring of key fitness indicators.\n   Different\
    \ applications use Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, or ZigBee connections to\n   access the patient's\

    \   devices may be critical to safeguarding the individual.  The level of\n  \

- title: 4.6.  Building Automation
  contents:
  - "4.6.  Building Automation\n   Building automation comprises the distributed systems\
    \ designed and\n   deployed to monitor and control the mechanical, electrical,\
    \ and\n   electronic systems inside buildings with various destinations (e.g.,\n\
    \   public and private, industrial, institutions, or residential).\n   Advanced\
    \ Building Automation Systems (BASs) may be deployed\n   concentrating the various\
    \ functions of safety, environmental control,\n   occupancy, and security.  Increasingly,\
    \ the deployment of the various\n   functional systems is connected to the same\
    \ communication\n   infrastructure (possibly IP-based), which may involve wired\
    \ or\n   wireless communication networks inside the building.\n   Building automation\
    \ requires the deployment of a large number (10 to\n   100,000) of sensors that\
    \ monitor the status of devices, parameters\n   inside the building, and controllers\
    \ with different specialized\n   functionality for areas within the building or\
    \ the totality of the\n   building.  Inter-node distances between neighboring\
    \ nodes vary from 1\n   to 20 meters.  The NMS must, as a result, be able to manage\
    \ and\n   monitor a large number of devices, which may be organized in multi-\n\
    \   hop meshed networks.  Distances between the nodes, and the use of\n   constrained\
    \ protocols, means that networks of nodes might be\n   segmented.  The management\
    \ of such network segments and nodes in\n   these segments should be possible.\
    \  Contrary to home automation, in\n   building management the devices are expected\
    \ to be managed assets and\n   known to a set of commissioning tools and a data\
    \ storage, such that\n   every connected device has a known origin.  This requires\
    \ the\n   management system to be able to discover devices on the network and\n\
    \   ensure that the expected list of devices is currently matched.\n   Management\
    \ here includes verifying the presence of the expected\n   devices and detecting\
    \ the presence of unwanted devices.\n   Examples of functions performed by controllers\
    \ in building automation\n   are regulating the quality, humidity, and temperature\
    \ of the air\n   inside the building as well as regulating the lighting.  Other\n\
    \   systems may report the status of the machinery inside the building\n   like\
    \ elevators or inside the rooms like projectors in meeting rooms.\n   Security\
    \ cameras and sensors may be deployed and operated on separate\n   dedicated infrastructures\
    \ connected to the common backbone.  The\n   deployment area of a BAS is typically\
    \ inside one building (or part of\n   it) or several buildings geographically\
    \ grouped in a campus.  A\n   building network can be composed of network segments,\
    \ where a network\n   segment covers a floor, an area on the floor, or a given\n\
    \   functionality (e.g., security cameras).  It is possible that the\n   management\
    \ tasks of different types of some devices might be\n   separated from others\
    \ (e.g, security cameras might operate and be\n   managed via a network separate\
    \ from that of the HVAC in a building).\n   Some of the sensors in BASs (for example,\
    \ fire alarms or security\n   systems) register, record, and transfer critical\
    \ alarm information;\n   therefore, they must be resilient to events like loss\
    \ of power or\n   security attacks.  A management system must be able to deal\
    \ with\n   unintentional segmentation of networks due to power loss or channel\n\
    \   unavailability.  It must also be able to detect security events.  Due\n  \
    \ to specific operating conditions required from certain devices, there\n   might\
    \ be a need to certify components and subsystems operating in\n   such constrained\
    \ conditions based on specific requirements.  Also, in\n   some environments,\
    \ the malfunctioning of a control system (like\n   temperature control) needs\
    \ to be reported in the shortest possible\n   time.  Complex control systems can\
    \ misbehave, and their critical\n   status reporting and safety algorithms need\
    \ to be basic and robust\n   and perform even in critical conditions.  Providing\
    \ this monitoring,\n   configuration and notification service is an important\
    \ task of the\n   management system used in building automation.\n   In some cases,\
    \ building automation solutions are deployed in newly\n   designed buildings;\
    \ in other cases, it might be over existing\n   infrastructures.  In the first\
    \ case, there is a broader range of\n   possible solutions, which can be planned\
    \ for the infrastructure of\n   the building.  In the second case, the solution\
    \ needs to be deployed\n   over an existing infrastructure taking into account\
    \ factors like\n   existing wiring, distance limitations, and the propagation\
    \ of radio\n   signals over walls and floors, thereby making deployment difficult.\n\
    \   As a result, some of the existing WLAN solutions (e.g., [IEEE802.11]\n   or\
    \ [IEEE802.15]) may be deployed.  In mission-critical or security-\n   sensitive\
    \ environments and in cases where link failures happen often,\n   topologies that\
    \ allow for reconfiguration of the network and\n   connection continuity may be\
    \ required.  Some of the sensors deployed\n   in building automation may be very\
    \ simple constrained devices for\n   which C0 or C1 [RFC7228] may be assumed.\n\
    \   For lighting applications, groups of lights must be defined and\n   managed.\
    \  Commands to a group of light must arrive within 200 ms at\n   all destinations.\
    \  The installation and operation of a building\n   network has different requirements.\
    \  During the installation, many\n   stand-alone networks of a few to 100 nodes\
    \ coexist without a\n   connection to the backbone.  During this phase, the nodes\
    \ are\n   identified with a network identifier related to their physical\n   location.\
    \  Devices are accessed from an installation tool to connect\n   them to the network\
    \ in a secure fashion.  During installation, the\n   setting of parameters of\
    \ common values to enable interoperability may\n   be required.  During operation,\
    \ the networks are connected to the\n   backbone while maintaining the network\
    \ identifier to physical\n   location relation.  Network parameters like address\
    \ and name are\n   stored in the DNS.  The names can assist in determining the\
    \ physical\n   location of the device.\n   It is also important for a building\
    \ automation NMS to take safety and\n   security into account.  Ensuring privacy\
    \ and confidentiality of data,\n   such that unauthorized parties do not get access\
    \ to it, is likely to\n   be important since users' individual behaviors could\
    \ be potentially\n   understood via their settings.  Appropriate security considerations\n\
    \   for authorization and access control to the NMS is also important\n   since\
    \ different users are likely to have varied levels of operational\n   permissions\
    \ in the system.  For example, while end users should be\n   able to control lighting\
    \ systems, HVAC systems, etc., only qualified\n   technicians should be able to\
    \ configure parameters that change the\n   fundamental operation of a device.\
    \  It is also important for devices\n   and the NMS to be able to detect and report\
    \ any tampering they might\n   find, since these could lead to potential user\
    \ safety concerns, e.g.,\n   if sensors controlling air quality are tampered with\
    \ such that the\n   levels of carbon monoxide become life threatening.  This implies\
    \ that\n   an NMS should also be able to deal with and appropriately prioritize\n\
    \   situations that might potentially lead to safety concerns.\n"

- title: 4.8.  Transport Applications
  contents:
  - "4.8.  Transport Applications\n   \"Transport application\" is a generic term\
    \ for the integrated\n   application of communications, control, and information\
    \ processing in\n   a transportation system.  \"Transport telematics\" and \"\
    vehicle\n   telematics\" are both used as terms for the group of technologies\
    \ that\n   support transportation systems.  Transport applications running on\n\
    \   such a transportation system cover all modes of the transport and\n   consider\
    \ all elements of the transportation system, i.e. the vehicle,\n   the infrastructure,\
    \ and the driver or user, interacting together\n   dynamically.  Examples for\
    \ transport applications are inter- and\n   intra-vehicular communication, smart\
    \ traffic control, smart parking,\n   electronic toll-collection systems, logistic\
    \ and fleet management,\n   vehicle control, and safety and roadside assistance.\n\
    \   As a distributed system, transport applications require an end-to-end\n  \
    \ management of different types of networks.  It is likely that\n   constrained\
    \ devices in a network (e.g., a moving in-car network) have\n   to be controlled\
    \ by an application running on an application server\n   in the network of a service\
    \ provider.  Such a highly distributed\n   network including cellular devices\
    \ on vehicles is assumed to include\n   a wireless access network using diverse\
    \ long-distance wireless\n   technologies such as WiMAX, 3G/LTE, or satellite\
    \ communication, e.g.,\n   based on an embedded hardware module.  As a result,\
    \ the management of\n   constrained devices in the transport system might be necessary\
    \ to\n   plan top-down and might need to use data models obliged from and\n  \
    \ defined on the application layer.  The assumed device classes in use\n   are\
    \ mainly C2 [RFC7228] devices.  In cases, where an in-vehicle\n   network is involved,\
    \ C1 devices [RFC7228] with limited capabilities\n   and a short-distance constrained\
    \ radio network, e.g., IEEE 802.15.4\n   might be used additionally.\n   All Transport\
    \ Applications will require an IT infrastructure to run\n   on top of, e.g., in\
    \ public-transport scenarios like trains, buses, or\n   metro networks infrastructure\
    \ might be provided, maintained, and\n   operated by third parties like mobile-network\
    \ or satellite-network\n   operators.  However, the management responsibility\
    \ of the transport\n   application typically rests within the organization running\
    \ the\n   transport application (in the public-transport scenario, this would\n\
    \   typically be the public-transport operator).  Different aspects of\n   the\
    \ infrastructure might also be managed by different entities.  For\n   example,\
    \ the in-car devices are likely to be installed and managed by\n   the manufacturer,\
    \ while the local government or transportation\n   authority might be responsible\
    \ for the on-road vehicular\n   communication infrastructure used by these devices.\
    \  The backend\n   infrastructure is also likely to be maintained by third-party\n\
    \   operators.  As such, the NMS must be able to deal with different\n   network\
    \ segments (each being operated and controlled by separate\n   entities) and enable\
    \ appropriate access control and security.\n   Depending on the type of application\
    \ domain (vehicular or stationary)\n   and service being provided, it is important\
    \ for the NMS to be able to\n   function with different architectures, since different\
    \ manufacturers\n   might have their own proprietary systems relying on a specific\n\
    \   management topology option, as described in [RFC7547].  Moreover,\n   constituents\
    \ of the network can either be private, belong to\n   individuals or private companies,\
    \ or be owned by public institutions\n   leading to different legal and organization\
    \ requirements.  Across the\n   entire infrastructure, a variety of constrained\
    \ devices is likely to\n   be used, and they must be individually managed.  The\
    \ NMS must be able\n   to either work directly with different types of devices\
    \ or have the\n   ability to interoperate with multiple different systems.\n \
    \  The challenges in the management of vehicles in a mobile-transport\n   application\
    \ are manifold.  The up-to-date position of each node in\n   the network should\
    \ be reported to the corresponding management\n   entities, since the nodes could\
    \ be moving within or roaming between\n   different networks.  Secondly, a variety\
    \ of troubleshooting\n   information, including sensitive location information,\
    \ needs to be\n   reported to the management system in order to provide accurate\n\
    \   service to the customer.  Management systems dealing with mobile\n   nodes\
    \ could possibly exploit specific patterns in the mobility of the\n   nodes. \
    \ These patterns emerge due to repetitive vehicular usage in\n   scenarios like\
    \ people commuting to work and supply vehicles\n   transporting shipments between\
    \ warehouses, etc.  The NMS must also be\n   able to handle partitioned networks,\
    \ which would arise due to the\n   dynamic nature of traffic resulting in large\
    \ inter-vehicle gaps in\n   sparsely populated scenarios.  Since mobile nodes\
    \ might roam in\n   remote networks, the NMS should be able to provide operating\n\
    \   configuration updates regardless of node location.\n   The constrained devices\
    \ in a moving transport network might be\n   initially configured in a factory,\
    \ and a reconfiguration might be\n   needed only rarely.  New devices might be\
    \ integrated in an ad hoc\n   manner based on self-management and self-configuration\
    \ capabilities.\n   Monitoring and data exchange might be necessary via a gateway\
    \ entity\n   connected to the backend transport infrastructure.  The devices and\n\
    \   entities in the transport infrastructure need to be monitored more\n   frequently\
    \ and may be able to communicate with a higher data rate.\n   The connectivity\
    \ of such entities does not necessarily need to be\n   wireless.  The time scale\
    \ for detecting and recording failures in a\n   moving transport network is likely\
    \ measured in hours, and repairs\n   might easily take days.  It is likely that\
    \ a self-healing feature\n   would be used locally.  On the other hand, failures\
    \ in fixed\n   transport-application infrastructure (e.g., traffic lights, digital-\n\
    \   signage displays) are likely to be measured in minutes so as to avoid\n  \
    \ untoward traffic incidents.  As such, the NMS must be able to deal\n   with\
    \ differing timeliness requirements based on the type of devices.\n   Since transport\
    \ applications of the constrained devices and networks\n   deal with automotive\
    \ vehicles, malfunctions and misuse can\n   potentially lead to safety concerns\
    \ as well.  As such, besides access\n   control, privacy of user data, and timeliness,\
    \ management systems\n   should also be able to detect situations that are potentially\n\
    \   hazardous to safety.  Some of these situations could be automatically\n  \
    \ mitigated, e.g., traffic lights with incorrect timing, but others\n   might\
    \ require human intervention, e.g., failed traffic lights.  The\n   management\
    \ system should take appropriate actions in these\n   situations.  Maintaining\
    \ data confidentiality and integrity is also\n   an important security aspect\
    \ of a management system since tampering\n   (or malfunction) can also lead to\
    \ potentially dangerous situations.\n"
- title: 4.9.  Community Network Applications
  contents:
  - "4.9.  Community Network Applications\n   Community networks are comprised of\
    \ constrained routers in a multi-\n   hop mesh topology, communicating over lossy,\
    \ and often wireless,\n   channels.  While the routers are mostly non-mobile,\
    \ the topology may\n   be very dynamic because of fluctuations in link quality\
    \ of the\n   (wireless) channel caused by, e.g., obstacles, or other nearby radio\n\
    \   transmissions.  Depending on the routers that are used in the\n   community\
    \ network, the resources of the routers (memory, CPU) may be\n   more or less\
    \ constrained -- available resources may range from only a\n   few kilobytes of\
    \ RAM to several megabytes or more, and CPUs may be\n   small and embedded, or\
    \ more powerful general-purpose processors.\n   Examples of such community networks\
    \ are the FunkFeuer network\n   (Vienna, Austria), FreiFunk (Berlin, Germany),\
    \ Seattle Wireless\n   (Seattle, USA), and AWMN (Athens, Greece).  These community\
    \ networks\n   are public and non-regulated, allowing their users to connect to\
    \ each\n   other and -- through an uplink to an ISP -- to the Internet.  No fee,\n\
    \   other than the initial purchase of a wireless router, is charged for\n   these\
    \ services.  Applications of these community networks can be\n   diverse, e.g.,\
    \ location-based services, free Internet access, file\n   sharing between users,\
    \ distributed chat services, social networking,\n   video sharing, etc.\n   As\
    \ an example of a community network, the FunkFeuer network comprises\n   several\
    \ hundred routers, many of which have several radio interfaces\n   (with omnidirectional\
    \ and some directed antennas).  The routers of\n   the network are small-sized\
    \ wireless routers, such as the Linksys\n   WRT54GL, available in 2011 for less\
    \ than 50 euros.  Each router, with\n   16 MB of RAM and 264 MHz of CPU power,\
    \ is mounted on the rooftop of a\n   user.  When a new user wants to connect to\
    \ the network, they acquire\n   a wireless router, install the appropriate firmware\
    \ and routing\n   protocol, and mount the router on the rooftop.  IP addresses\
    \ for the\n   router are assigned manually from a list of addresses (because of\
    \ the\n   lack of autoconfiguration standards for mesh networks in the IETF).\n\
    \   While the routers are non-mobile, fluctuations in link quality\n   require\
    \ an ad hoc routing protocol that allows for quick convergence\n   to reflect\
    \ the effective topology of the network (such as\n   Neighborhood Discovery Protocol\
    \ (NHDP) [RFC6130] and Optimized Link\n   State Routing version 2 (OLSRv2) [RFC7181]\
    \ developed in the MANET\n   WG).  Usually, no human interaction is required for\
    \ these protocols,\n   as all variable parameters required by the routing protocol\
    \ are\n   either negotiated in the control traffic exchange or are only of\n \
    \  local importance to each router (i.e. do not influence\n   interoperability).\
    \  However, external management and monitoring of an\n   ad hoc routing protocol\
    \ may be desirable to optimize parameters of\n   the routing protocol.  Such an\
    \ optimization may lead to a topology\n   that is perceived to be more stable\
    \ and to a lower control traffic\n   overhead (and therefore to a higher delivery\
    \ success ratio of data\n   packets, a lower end-to-end delay, and less unnecessary\
    \ bandwidth and\n   energy use).\n   Different use cases for the management of\
    \ community networks are\n   possible:\n   o  A single NMS, e.g., a border gateway\
    \ providing connectivity to the\n      Internet, requires managing or monitoring\
    \ routers in the community\n      network, in order to investigate problems (monitoring)\
    \ or to\n      improve performance by changing parameters (managing).  As the\n\
    \      topology of the network is dynamic, constant connectivity of each\n   \
    \   router towards the management station cannot be guaranteed.\n      Current\
    \ network management protocols, such as SNMP and Network\n      Configuration\
    \ Protocol (NETCONF), may be used (e.g., use of\n      interfaces such as the\
    \ NHDP-MIB [RFC6779]).  However, when routers\n      in the community network\
    \ are constrained, existing protocols may\n      require too many resources in\
    \ terms of memory and CPU; and more\n      importantly, the bandwidth requirements\
    \ may exceed the available\n      channel capacity in wireless mesh networks.\
    \  Moreover, management\n      and monitoring may be unfeasible if the connection\
    \ between the NMS\n      and the routers is frequently interrupted.\n   o  Distributed\
    \ network monitoring, in which more than one management\n      station monitors\
    \ or manages other routers.  Because connectivity\n      to a server cannot be\
    \ guaranteed at all times, a distributed\n      approach may provide a higher\
    \ reliability, at the cost of\n      increased complexity.  Currently, no IETF\
    \ standard exists for\n      distributed monitoring and management.\n   o  Monitoring\
    \ and management of a whole network or a group of\n      routers.  Monitoring\
    \ the performance of a community network may\n      require more information than\
    \ what can be acquired from a single\n      router using a network management\
    \ protocol.  Statistics, such as\n      topology changes over time, data throughput\
    \ along certain routing\n      paths, congestion, etc., are of interest for a\
    \ group of routers\n      (or the routing domain) as a whole.  As of 2014, no\
    \ IETF standard\n      allows for monitoring or managing whole networks instead\
    \ of single\n      routers.\n"
- title: 4.10.  Field Operations
  contents:
  - "4.10.  Field Operations\n   The challenges of configuring and monitoring networks\
    \ operated in the\n   field by rescue and security agencies can be different from\
    \ the other\n   use cases since the requirements and operating conditions of such\n\
    \   networks are quite different.\n   With technology advancements, field networks\
    \ operated nowadays are\n   becoming large and can consist of a variety of different\
    \ types of\n   equipment that run different protocols and tools that obviously\n\
    \   increase complexity of these mission-critical networks.  In many\n   scenarios,\
    \ configurations are, most likely, manually performed.\n   Furthermore, some legacy\
    \ and even modern devices do not even support\n   IP networking.  A majority of\
    \ protocols and tools developed by\n   vendors that are being used are proprietary,\
    \ which makes integration\n   more difficult.\n   The main reason for this disjoint\
    \ operation scenario is that most\n   equipment is developed with specific task\
    \ requirements in mind,\n   rather than interoperability of the varied equipment\
    \ types.  For\n   example, the operating conditions experienced by high altitude\n\
    \   security equipment is significantly different from that used in\n   desert\
    \ conditions.  Similarly, equipment used in fire rescue has\n   different requirements\
    \ than flood-relief equipment.  Furthermore,\n   interoperation of equipment with\
    \ telecommunication equipment was not\n   an expected outcome or (in some scenarios)\
    \ may not even be desirable.\n   Currently, field networks operate with a fixed\
    \ Network Operations\n   Center (NOC) that physically manages the configuration\
    \ and evaluation\n   of all field devices.  Once configured, the devices might\
    \ be deployed\n   in fixed or mobile scenarios.  Any configuration changes required\n\
    \   would need to be appropriately encrypted and authenticated to prevent\n  \
    \ unauthorized access.\n   Hierarchical management of devices is a common requirement\
    \ in such\n   scenarios since local managers or operators may need to respond\
    \ to\n   changing conditions within their purview.  The level of configuration\n\
    \   management available at each hierarchy must also be closely governed.\n  \
    \ Since many field operation devices are used in hostile environments,\n   a high\
    \ failure and disconnection rate should be tolerated by the NMS,\n   which must\
    \ also be able to deal with multiple gateways and disjoint\n   management protocols.\n\
    \   Multi-national field operations involving search, rescue, and\n   security\
    \ are becoming increasingly common, requiring interoperation\n   of a diverse\
    \ set of equipment designed with different operating\n   conditions in mind. \
    \ Furthermore, different intra- and inter-\n   governmental agencies are likely\
    \ to have a different set of\n   standards, best practices, rules and regulations,\
    \ and implementation\n   approaches that may contradict or conflict with each\
    \ other.  The NMS\n   should be able to detect these and handle them in an acceptable\n\
    \   manner, which may require human intervention.\n"
