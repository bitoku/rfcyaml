  - "1.  Introduction\n   LDP [RFC5036] specifies two peer discovery mechanisms, a
    Basic one\n   and an Extended one, both using UDP transport.  The Basic Discovery\n
    \  mechanism is used to discover LDP peers that are directly connected\n   at
    the link level, whereas the Extended Discovery mechanism is used\n   to locate
    Label Switching Router (LSR) neighbors that are not\n   directly connected at
    the link level.  Once discovered, the LSR\n   neighbors can establish the LDP
    peering session, using the TCP\n   transport connection.\n   The Generalized TTL
    Security Mechanism (GTSM) [RFC5082] is a\n   mechanism based on IPv4 Time To Live
    (TTL) or IPv6 Hop Limit value\n   verification so as to provide a simple and reasonably
    robust defense\n   from infrastructure attacks using forged protocol packets from\n
    \  outside the network.  GTSM can be applied to any protocol peering\n   session
    that is established between routers that are adjacent.\n   Therefore, GTSM can
    protect an LDP protocol peering session\n   established using Basic Discovery.\n
    \  This document specifies LDP enhancements to accommodate GTSM.  In\n   particular,
    this document specifies the enhancements in the following\n   areas:\n   1.  The
    Common Hello Parameter TLV of LDP Link Hello message\n   2.  Sending and Receiving
    procedures for LDP Link Hello message\n   3.  Sending and Receiving procedures
    for LDP Initialization message\n   GTSM specifies that \"it SHOULD NOT be enabled
    by default in order to\n   remain backward compatible with the unmodified protocol\"
    (see Section\n   3 of [RFC5082]).  This document specifies a \"built-in dynamic
    GTSM\n   capability negotiation\" for LDP to suggest the use of GTSM.  GTSM\n
    \  will be used as specified in this document provided both peers on an\n   LDP
    session can detect each others' support for GTSM procedures and\n   agree to use
    it.  That is, the desire to use GTSM (i.e., its\n   negotiation mechanics) is
    enabled by default without any\n   configuration.\n   This specification uses
    a bit reserved in Section 3.5.2 of [RFC5036]\n   and therefore updates [RFC5036].\n"

  - contents:
    - "1.2.  Scope\n   This document defines procedures for LDP using IPv4 routing
      but not\n   for LDP using IPv6 routing, since the latter has GTSM built into
      the\n   protocol definition [LDP-IPV6].\n   Additionally, the GTSM for LDP specified
      in this document applies\n   only to single-hop LDP peering sessions and not
      to multi-hop LDP\n   peering sessions, in line with Section 5.5 of [RFC5082].\n
      \  Consequently, any LDP method or feature (such as LDP IGP\n   Synchronization
      [RFC5443] or LDP Session Protection [LDP-SPROT]) that\n   relies on multi-hop
      LDP peering sessions would not work with GTSM and\n   will require (statically
      or dynamically) disabling the GTSM\n   capability.  See Section 3.\n"

    - "2.2.  GTSM Sending and Receiving Procedures for LDP Link Hello\n   First, LSRs
      using LDP Basic Discovery [RFC5036] send LDP Hello\n   messages to link-level
      multicast address (224.0.0.2 or \"all\n   routers\").  Such messages are never
      forwarded beyond one hop and are\n   RECOMMENDED to have their IP TTL or Hop
      Count = 1.\n   Unless configured otherwise, an LSR that supports GTSM procedures\n
      \  MUST set the G flag (for GTSM) to 1 in the Common Hello Parameter TLV\n   in
      the LDP Link Hello message [RFC5036].\n   If an LSR that supports GTSM and is
      configured to use it recognizes\n   the presence of the G flag (in the Common
      Hello Parameter TLV) with\n   the value = 1 in the received LDP Link Hello message,
      then it MUST\n   enforce GTSM for LDP in the subsequent TCP/LDP peering session
      with\n   the neighbor that sent the Hello message, as specified in Section 2.3\n
      \  of this document.\n   If an LSR does not recognize the presence of the G
      flag (in the\n   Common Hello Parameter TLV of Link Hello message), or recognizes
      the\n   presence of G flag with the value = 0, then the LSR MUST NOT enforce\n
      \  GTSM for LDP in the subsequent TCP/LDP peering session with the\n   neighbor
      that sent the Hello message.  This ensures backward\n   compatibility as well
      as automatic GTSM deactivation.\n"

      LSR that has sent and received LDP Link Hello with G flag = 1\n   from the directly

      in Section 3 of [RFC5082], in the forthcoming\n   TCP Transport Connection with
      that neighbor.  This means that the LSR\n   MUST check for the incoming unicast
      packets' TTL or Hop Count to be\n   255 for the particular LDP/TCP peering session

  - "3.  LDP Peering Scenarios and GTSM Considerations\n   This section discusses
    GTSM considerations arising from the LDP\n   peering scenarios used, including
    single-hop versus multi-hop LDP\n   neighbors, as well as the use of LDP Basic
    Discovery versus Extended\n   Discovery.\n   The reason that the GTSM capability
    negotiation is enabled for Basic\n   Discovery by default (i.e., G=1) but not
    for Extended Discovery is\n   that the usage of Basic Discovery typically relates
    to a single-hop\n   LDP peering session, whereas the usage of Extended Discovery\n
    \  typically relates to a multi-hop LDP peering session.  GTSM\n   protection
    for multi-hop LDP sessions is outside the scope of this\n   specification (see
    Section 1.2).  However, it is worth clarifying the\n   following exceptions that
    may occur with Basic or Extended Discovery\n   usage:\n   a.  Two adjacent LSRs
    (i.e., back-to-back PE routers) forming a\n       single-hop LDP peering session
    after doing an Extended Discovery\n       (e.g., for Pseudowire signaling)\n   b.
    \ Two adjacent LSRs forming a multi-hop LDP peering session after\n       doing
    a Basic Discovery, due to the way IP routing is set up\n       between them (either
    temporarily or permanently)\n   c.  Two adjacent LSRs (i.e., back-to-back PE routers)
    forming a\n       single-hop LDP peering session after doing both Basic and\n
    \      Extended Discovery\n   In the first case (a), GTSM is not enabled for the
    LDP peering\n   session by default.  In the second case (b), GTSM is actually
    enabled\n   by default and enforced for the LDP peering session; hence, it would\n
    \  prohibit the LDP peering session from getting established (note that\n   this
    may impact features such as LDP IGP Synchronization [RFC5443] or\n   LDP Session
    Protection [LDP-SPROT]).  In the third case (c), GTSM is\n   enabled by default
    for Basic Discovery and enforced on the subsequent\n   LDP peering, and is not
    for Extended Discovery.  However, if each LSR\n   uses the same IPv4 transport
    address object value in both Basic and\n   Extended Discoveries, then it would
    result in a single LDP peering\n   session that would be enabled with GTSM.  Otherwise,
    GTSM would not\n   be enforced on the second LDP peering session corresponding
    to the\n   Extended Discovery.\n   This document allows for the implementation
    to provide an option to\n   statically (e.g., via configuration) and/or dynamically
    override the\n   default behavior and enable/disable GTSM on a per-peer basis.
    \ This\n   would address all the exceptions listed above.\n"
  title: 3.  LDP Peering Scenarios and GTSM Considerations
- contents:
  - "4.  Security Considerations\n   This document increases the security for LDP,
    making it more\n   resilient to off-link attacks.  Security considerations for
    GTSM are\n   detailed in Section 5 of [RFC5082].\n   As discussed in Section 3,
    it is possible that\n   o  GTSM for LDP may not always be enforced on a single-hop
    LDP\n      peering session, and LDP may still be susceptible to forged/\n      spoofed
    protocol packets, if a single-hop LDP peering session is\n      set up using Extended
    Discovery.\n   o  GTSM for LDP may cause the LDP peering session to not get\n
    \     established (or may be torn down), if IP routing ever declares\n      that
    the directly connected peer is more than one IP hop away.\n      Suffice to say,
    use of cryptographic integrity (e.g., [RFC5925])\n      is recommended as an alternate
    solution for detecting forged\n      protocol packets (especially for the multi-hop
    case).\n   The GTSM specification [RFC5082] says that protocol messages used for\n
    \  dynamic negotiation of GTSM support MUST be authenticated.  However,\n   LDP
    discovery [RFC5036] uses UDP transport and does not have an\n   authentication
    mechanism.  The GTSM specification further elaborates\n   by saying that GTSM
    is not a substitute for authentication and does\n   not secure against insider
    on-the-wire attacks.  LDP Basic Discovery\n   uses link-level multicast address
    (224.0.0.2 or \"all routers\") that\n   are never forwarded beyond the link, and
    this acts as a basic\n   protection against off-the-wire attacks.\n"
