  - "Abstract\n   Though the ISO character set standard of ISO 10646 is specified\n\
    \   reasonably well about European characters, it is not so useful in an\n   fully\
    \ internationalized environment.\n   For the practical use of ISO 10646, a lot\
    \ of external profiling such\n   as restriction of characters, restriction of\
    \ combination of\n   characters and addition of language information is necessary.\n\
    \   This memo provides information on such profiling, along with charset\n   names\
    \ to each profiled instance.\n   Though all the effort is done to make the resulting\
    \ charset as useful\n   10646 based charset as possible, the result is not so\
    \ good.  So, the\n   charsets defined in this memo are only for reference purpose\
    \ and its\n   use for practical purpose is strongly discouraged.\n"
- title: Introduction
  contents:
  - "Introduction\n   This memo describes two text encoding schemes based on ISO 10646\n\
    \   [10646].\n   As ISO 10646 specifies too little about how text is visualized,\
    \ to\n   practically use ISO 10646, it is necessary to restrict the standard\n\
    \   minimally and then add some amount of profiling information.\n   For ISO 2022\
    \ [ISO2022] based national standards, sufficient profiling\n   information is\
    \ provided by national standardization bodies, but, for\n   ISO 10646, such a\
    \ profiling is not yet provided.\n   As the profiling of ISO 10646 largely affects\
    \ which character or\n   combination of characters could be properly displayed,\
    \ changes of\n   profiling of ISO 10646 are as significant as additions of new\n\
    \   character sets of ISO 2022.\n   That is, it's impractical to support the entirety\
    \ of ISO 10646 (new\n   restriction or profiling can always be added), so a client\
    \ needs to\n   know whether some restriction or profiling is being used before\
    \ it\n   can decide whether to display the body part. Thus, it is necessary to\n\
    \   provide multiple charset names to each variation of ISO 10646.\n   For example,\
    \ in Japan with Japanese windows NT, only those Han\n   characters already supported\
    \ by MS Kanji code (mostly equivalent to\n   JIS X 0208 [JISX0208]) can be displayed,\
    \ because no other font\n   pattern is commonly provided.\n   The other problem\
    \ of ISO 10646 for Han characters is that, to display\n   them in quality required\
    \ for daily plain text processing in\n   China/Japan/Korea, it is necessary to\
    \ add profiling information on\n   which one of Chinese/Japanese/Korean the text\
    \ is using.  It should be\n   noted that this feature makes multilingual mixed\n\
    \   Chinese/Japanese/Korean text with ISO 10646 impractical.\n   Also, just as\
    \ [RFC1521] was unclear about how bi-directionality\n   should be supported with\
    \ \"ISO-8859-6\" and \"ISO-8859-8\" which was\n   corrected by [RFC1556], it is\
    \ also unclear how bi-directionality\n   could be supported with ISO 10646.  There\
    \ are too much ways to\n   support bi- directionality.  So, until some bi-directionality\n\
    \   mechanism(s) becomes widely supported, it is necessary to exclude\n   characters\
    \ for languages which requires bi-directionality support\n   from the minimal\
    \ variation.  It should be noted that, though ISO\n   10646 is intended to be\
    \ free from long term states, save for some\n   profiling information, introduction\
    \ of bi-directionality with ISO\n   10646 do requires the long term states.\n\
    \   Combining characters also cause problems. In many countries where\n   combining\
    \ characters based on [ISO2022] is used, there are\n   restrictions on how combining\
    \ characters are ordered [TIS].  Without\n   such restriction, the result of combination\
    \ is completely meaningless\n   which is the current state of ISO 10646.  That\
    \ is, if some\n   combination is allowed in some implementation while the other\
    \ does\n   not support it, communication between them is difficult unless ISO\n\
    \   10646 is profiled to be least common set of widely supported\n   combinations.\
    \  So, again, until combination restriction will be\n   developed for each language,\
    \ it is necessary to exclude characters\n   for such languages from the minimal\
    \ variation.\n   Conjoining characters also, may or may not be supported, which\n\
    \   requires another profiling.\n   According to those considerations, this memo\
    \ defines two variations\n   of ISO 10646. They are \"ISO-10646\" as the minimal\
    \ basic variation and\n   \"ISO-10646-J-1\" as the variation which could be useful\
    \ in Japan.\n   Finally, this memo, by no means, promotes the use of ISO 10646\
    \ on the\n   Internet.  It's use is strongly discouraged, when there are other\n\
    \   charsets which can encode the same information, Families of ISO 10646\n  \
    \ based charsets, like ISO 2022 based charsets, only forms set of\n   mutually\
    \ incompatible encoding systems and, unlike ISO 2022 based\n   charsets [2022INT],\
    \ they can not be merged together to be the single\n   world wide charset.\n"
