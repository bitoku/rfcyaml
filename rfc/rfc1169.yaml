  contents:
  - "2.  Abstract\n   The Federal Networking Council (FNC), the Internet Activities\
    \ Board\n   (IAB), and the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) have a firm\n\
    \   commitment to responsible integration of OSI based upon sound network\n  \
    \ planning.  This implies that OSI will be added to the Internet\n   without sacrificing\
    \ services now available to existing Internet\n   users, and that a multi-protocol\
    \ environment will exist in the\n   Internet for a prolonged period.  Planning\
    \ is underway within the\n   Internet community to enable integration of OSI,\
    \ coexistence of OSI\n   with TCP/IP, and interoperability between OSI and TCP/IP.\n\
    \   The U.S. Government OSI Profile (GOSIP) is a necessary tool for\n   planning\
    \ OSI integration.  However, as the August 1990 requirement\n   date for GOSIP\
    \ compliance approaches, concern remains as to how GOSIP\n   should be applied\
    \ to near-term network planning.\n   The intent of this statement is to help explain\
    \ the role and\n   applicability of the GOSIP document, as well as to emphasize\
    \ the\n   government's commitment to an integrated interoperable OSI\n   environment\
    \ based on responsible planning.\n"
- title: 3.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "3.  Introduction\n   The Federal Agencies, represented in the Federal Networking\
    \ Council\n   (FNC), as well as the Internet community represented by the Internet\n\
    \   Activities Board (IAB), and the Internet Engineering Task Force\n   (IETF)\
    \ are fully committed to integrating OSI into the Internet, as\n   it is recognized\
    \ that OSI is an international standard networking\n   protocol suite.  The FNC,\
    \ IAB, and IETF are taking sound technical\n   steps to integrate OSI in a fashion\
    \ and on a schedule that assures\n   current levels of service to users of the\
    \ existing operational\n   networks that are a part of the Internet.  The large\
    \ existing\n   installed base of TCP/IP protocol users, the limited deployment\
    \ of\n   commercial OSI products, and the incomplete development of OSI\n   standards\
    \ for routing, network management, and directory services\n   combine to make\
    \ an immediate, total transition to a pure OSI\n   environment in the Internet\
    \ unrealistic.\n   In what follows, we present a brief overview of GOSIP and we\
    \ address\n   some of the often confusing points about the intent, applicability,\n\
    \   and implementation of GOSIP.  We also describe the role of the IETF\n   regarding\
    \ the integration of OSI into the Internet.  Further, we\n   discuss the role\
    \ of Federal Agencies in this process.\n"

- title: 5.  GOSIP Background
  contents:
  - "5.  GOSIP Background\n   The Government OSI Profile (GOSIP), published as Federal\
    \ Information\n   Processing Standard (FIPS) 146, issued by the National Institute\
    \ of\n   Standards and Technology (NIST), specifies the details of an OSI\n  \
    \ configuration for use in the Government so that interoperable OSI\n   products\
    \ can be procured from commercial vendors.  GOSIP is needed\n   because OSI standards\
    \ allow many potential options and choices, some\n   of which are incompatible.\
    \  GOSIP is based on refinements of OSI\n   standards.  The refinements are agreed\
    \ to by commercial implementors\n   and potential users through a series of OSI\
    \ Implementors Workshops\n   (OIW) hosted by NIST four times every year since\
    \ 1983.  As OSI\n   becomes more widely deployed, GOSIP compliance will become\n\
    \   increasingly important.\n   GOSIP was written by an inter-agency group and\
    \ continues to evolve\n   under the guidance of the GOSIP Advanced Requirements\
    \ Group.  The\n   IETF is represented on the GOSIP Advanced Requirements Group,\
    \ as are\n   Federal Government Agencies, including the FNC agencies.\n   The\
    \ GOSIP FIPS consists of:\n      1. An announcement adopting GOSIP as a Federal\
    \ standard.  The\n         announcement section of the FIPS covers topics such\
    \ as the\n         objectives of GOSIP, its applicability, implementation\n  \
    \       requirements, and waiver procedures.\n      2. The technical specification\
    \ of GOSIP products to be procured.\n         The technical specification section\
    \ of GOSIP describes the\n         details of a subset of OSI protocols.  Products\
    \ implementing\n         GOSIP are in development by or available from many computer\n\
    \         vendors.\n      3. Appendices describing the plans for including additional\n\
    \         functionality into future versions of the GOSIP technical\n        \
    \ specification.\n   The first version of GOSIP was published in August 1988 following\
    \ a\n   long comment period beginning as early as January 1987.  GOSIP was\n \
    \  adopted as FIPS 146 in February 1989 and will become a Federal\n   procurement\
    \ requirement in August 1990 [1].  A second version of\n   GOSIP will become a\
    \ FIPS in 1990 and will then become a Federal\n   procurement requirement 18 months\
    \ later [2].  Along with the second\n   version of GOSIP, NIST will issue errata\
    \ associated with GOSIP\n   Version 1.0.\n   There is an additional publication\
    \ called the GOSIP Users' Guide\n   which provides an expanded explanation of\
    \ GOSIP including tutorials,\n   interpretation, integration planning advice,\
    \ and information on\n   registration [3].  The GOSIP Users' Guide will be updated\
    \ and re-\n   released in coordination with each version of GOSIP.  Information\n\
    \   regarding how to obtain GOSIP and related documents is included in\n   the\
    \ Appendix to this RFC.\n"
- title: 6.  Understanding GOSIP
  contents:
  - "6.  Understanding GOSIP\n   There is a common misunderstanding that GOSIP mandates\
    \ an immediate,\n   total transition to the use of OSI protocols in August 1990.\
    \  Several\n   factors contribute to this misunderstanding including the summary\n\
    \   nature of the FIPS applicability and implementation sections, trade\n   press\
    \ synopses trying to explain a complex subject in simple terms,\n   and hearsay.\
    \  The FIPS language will be improved in GOSIP Version\n   2.0.  Additionally,\
    \ more detailed treatment is given to these issues\n   in the GOSIP Users' Guide.\
    \  Below is a summary of the issues.\n"
- title: 6.1.  Applicability
  contents:
  - "6.1.  Applicability\n   The motivation behind the creation of the U.S. GOSIP\
    \ document is to\n   achieve, in the long term, a common, vendor neutral, interoperable\n\
    \   computer communication capability throughout the U.S. Government.\n   Agreement\
    \ on a common configuration of OSI protocols (GOSIP) for\n   purposes of procurement\
    \ is intended to aid this objective.\n   Beginning in August, 1990, federal agencies\
    \ procuring computer\n   network products and services must require that those\
    \ products and\n   services comply with OSI, where feasible, as specified in GOSIP\n\
    \   Version 1.0.  This will insure that all government-procured OSI\n   products\
    \ and services meet the same OSI Protocol profile.\n   If the application for\
    \ which network services or products are\n   procured can be supported through\
    \ GOSIP Version 1.0-compliant\n   facilities, then it is required that compliant\
    \ products or services\n   be procured.\n"
- title: 6.1.1.  Procurement Vs. Transition
  contents:
  - "6.1.1.  Procurement Vs. Transition\n   FIPS 146 is a procurement specification.\
    \  The FIPS mandates the\n   acquisition of OSI products when agencies require\
    \ the functionality\n   supplied by the OSI features specified in GOSIP.  GOSIP\
    \ does not\n   mandate an immediate, total transition to OSI in August 1990.\n"
- title: 6.1.2.  Small Network Add-on Vs. Major Upgrade
  contents:
  - "6.1.2.  Small Network Add-on Vs. Major Upgrade\n   GOSIP applies most readily\
    \ to procurement of new networks and major\n   upgrades to existing networks.\
    \  \"Major upgrade\" does not necessarily\n   mean adding components to an existing\
    \ non-GOSIP network.  For\n   example, if an agency has an existing network and\
    \ needs to add\n   several compatible devices, there is no mandate to retrofit\
    \ GOSIP\n   into the entire existing network.\n"
- title: 6.1.3.  OSI Incompleteness
  contents:
  - "6.1.3.  OSI Incompleteness\n   Many of the OSI protocols are still in the process\
    \ of being\n   standardized.  The GOSIP 1.0 and 2.0 versions address only\n  \
    \ configurations of fully-standardized OSI protocols.  As new OSI\n   standards\
    \ emerge (e.g., for directory services, network management\n   and dynamic routing),\
    \ the GOSIP documents will be revised to\n   incorporate agreed profiles/configurations.\
    \  Each GOSIP document\n   contains appendices describing the status of OSI protocol\n\
    \   standardization and plans for incorporating new functionality into\n   subsequent\
    \ GOSIP versions.\n"
- title: 6.2.  Exclusivity
  contents:
  - "6.2.  Exclusivity\n   GOSIP is not exclusive.  When an agency implements GOSIP,\
    \ other\n   protocols may be procured and used in the same network.  This non-\n\
    \   exclusive arrangement will remain for the indefinite future for\n   several\
    \ reasons:\n      1. Agencies, with existing networks, that are planning an OSI\n\
    \         integration will require support for existing protocols and\n      \
    \   protocol converters during the integration period.\n      2. Non-GOSIP protocols\
    \ may provide some enhanced feature or\n         improved performance that an\
    \ agency may find beneficial.\n         GOSIP is meant to provide for Government-wide\
    \ interoperability,\n         but is not meant to do so at the expense of other\
    \ requirements.\n      3. GOSIP does not meet every networking requirement of\
    \ every\n         agency.  In fact, given the pace of technological change in\n\
    \         computing and communications, no single protocol suite is\n        \
    \ likely to meet every networking requirement.\n"
- title: 6.3.  Implementation
  contents:
  - "6.3.  Implementation\n   Each agency is responsible for planning the integration\
    \ of OSI into\n   agency networks.  Many factors must be considered, including,\
    \ but not\n   limited to:\n      o the installed network base\n      o requirements\
    \ for functionality not yet present in GOSIP\n      o availability of funds\n\
    \      o future plans for networks in support of agency missions\n      o requirements\
    \ for agency and government wide interoperability\n      o planned additions to\
    \ OSI functionality in future versions of\n        GOSIP.\n   NIST recommends\
    \ a three step approach to implement the provisions of\n   GOSIP:\n      1. develop\
    \ a clear and definitive policy regarding use of OSI\n         within an agency\n\
    \      2. develop an appropriate set of plans to implement the policy\n      3.\
    \ update and act on the plans as agency networks are acquired\n         and upgraded.\n\
    \   Agency management has the responsibility to determine applicability\n   of\
    \ GOSIP to particular procurements and to evaluate and grant or deny\n   waivers\
    \ from GOSIP when GOSIP would otherwise apply.  For further\n   details on these\
    \ issues see the GOSIP Users' Guide.\n"
- title: 6.4.  Waivers
  contents:
  - "6.4.  Waivers\n   Waivers may be granted from the mandated provisions of GOSIP\
    \ when\n   adherence to GOSIP would prevent an agency from accomplishing its\n\
    \   mission or when an agency would suffer adverse financial effects that\n  \
    \ are not offset by Government-wide savings.  Authority to grant such\n   waivers\
    \ is delegated to the heads of agencies.\n   Developing a waiver process should\
    \ be part of an agency's\n   implementation planning.  No waiver is needed if\
    \ GOSIP does not\n   apply.  Procedures are outlined in the FIPS and further discussed\
    \ in\n   the GOSIP Users' Guide.\n"
- title: 6.5.  Enforcement
  contents:
  - "6.5.  Enforcement\n   NIST does not have an enforcement responsibility with respect\
    \ to\n   GOSIP.  Any enforcement that occurs will result from the normal\n   process\
    \ of planning, acquiring, and implementing networks within\n   government agencies.\n"
- title: 7.  Role of the IETF in Support of OSI
  contents:
  - "7.  Role of the IETF in Support of OSI\n   Within the Internet community the\
    \ IETF, working under the direction\n   of the IAB, plays a key role in planning\
    \ for integration of OSI into\n   the Internet.  The IETF will define the technical\
    \ mechanisms\n   necessary to accommodate OSI in the Internet and to permit\n\
    \   coexistence and interoperability between OSI and TCP/IP protocols\n   during\
    \ the indeterminate period of multi-protocol operation.  IETF\n   activities include,\
    \ but are not limited to, drafting appropriate\n   RFCs, creating input to GOSIP,\
    \ the GOSIP Users' Guide, and the OSI\n   Implementors Workshop (OIW).  The IETF\
    \ may also recommend to the FNC\n   experiments to be undertaken to further the\
    \ integration of OSI into\n   the Internet.  One of the eight areas of work for\
    \ the IETF is\n   dedicated to OSI integration.  A representative of the IETF\
    \ is an\n   official member of the GOSIP Advanced Requirements Group.\n"
- title: 8.  Role of the Internet Infrastructure Agencies in Support of OSI
  contents:
  - "8.  Role of the Internet Infrastructure Agencies in Support of OSI\n   Certain\
    \ of the FNC agencies have a role in providing a significant\n   part of the communications\
    \ infrastructure for the Internet, that is,\n   links, backbone routers, management\
    \ facilities, and directory\n   services.  For example, the National Science Foundation\
    \ (NSF), the\n   National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), the Department\n\
    \   of Energy (DOE) and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency\n   (DARPA)\
    \ have such a role.  These agencies must provide for essential\n   infrastructure\
    \ services such as routing of ISO 8473 packets in the\n   NSFnet backbone, provision\
    \ of application level gateways enabling\n   interoperability between TCP/IP and\
    \ OSI applications, and provision\n   of OSI directory services.\n"
- title: 9.  Role of the Internet Using Agencies in the Application of OSI
  contents:
  - "9.  Role of the Internet Using Agencies in the Application of OSI\n   The FNC\
    \ agencies using Internet services also have a necessary role\n   in the integration\
    \ of OSI.  The FNC agencies must identify their\n   requirements and participate\
    \ in the IETF and GOSIP groups to ensure\n   that their needs can be met.  The\
    \ FNC agencies should also plan to\n   implement OSI within their networks in\
    \ accordance with the realities\n   of their technical and management plans, taking\
    \ cognizance of the\n   plans for and progress toward implementation of key OSI\
    \ elements in\n   the Internet Infrastructure.  Each FNC agency should develop\
    \ an\n   agency policy on the adoption and use of GOSIP and should initiate\n\
    \   planning for incorporation of GOSIP-compliant products into agency\n   networks.\n"
- title: 10.  Summary
  contents:
  - "10.  Summary\n   The FNC, the IAB, and the IETF have a firm commitment to responsible\n\
    \   integration of OSI protocols into the Internet based upon sound\n   network\
    \ planning.  A multi-protocol environment will exist in the\n   Internet for a\
    \ considerable period of time.  As OSI products grow in\n   number and capability\
    \ and as more OSI standards are completed, the\n   role of GOSIP will grow in\
    \ importance.\n   To summarize:\n      o FIPS 146 (GOSIP) is a specification of\
    \ which OSI protocols are\n        to be procured for U.S. Government use.  GOSIP\
    \ does not\n        mandate, or even explicitly address, the issue of protocol\n\
    \        transition.\n      o As a procurement specification, GOSIP does not apply\
    \ to existing\n        installed equipment.  It applies to new network procurements\
    \ and\n        major upgrades to existing networks.  \"Major upgrade\" does not\n\
    \        necessarily apply to increasing the number of components of\n       \
    \ current functionality in existing non-GOSIP networks.\n      o When GOSIP does\
    \ apply, it is not exclusionary.  That is, other\n        protocol families can\
    \ also be procured and used.\n      o When GOSIP does apply, waivers are allowed\
    \ in consideration of\n        specific agency requirements.  When GOSIP does\
    \ not apply, no\n        waiver is necessary.\n      o Agencies have the responsibility\
    \ 1) for agency-wide planning\n        for GOSIP compliance in their network procurements,\
    \ 2) for\n        developing their own waiver process, and 3) for determining\n\
    \        the applicability of GOSIP to any specific procurement.\n"

  - "12.2  NIST Workshop for Implementors of OSI Documents\n   The output of the NIST\
    \ Workshop for Implementors of OSI (OIW) is a\n   pair of aligned documents, one\
    \ representing Stable Implementation\n   Agreements (SIA), the other containing\
    \ Working Implementation\n   Agreements (WIA) that have not yet gone into the\
    \ stable document.\n   Material is in either one or the other of these documents,\
    \ but not\n   both, and the documents have the same index structure.\n   The SIA\
    \ is reproduced in its entirety at the beginning of each\n   calendar year, with\
    \ an incremented version number.  Replacement page\n   sets are distributed subsequently\
    \ three times during each year (after\n   each Workshop), reflecting edits to\
    \ the stable material.  The\n   replacement pages constitute the next edition\
    \ of that year's version.\n   The WIA is reproduced in its entirety after each\
    \ Workshop (held in\n   March, June, September and December).  OIW attendees automatically\n\
    \   receive the WIA.  OIW meeting dates in 1990 are:  March 12-16; June\n   18-22;\
    \ September 10-14; and December 10-14.\n   NIST POINTS OF CONTACT:\n         1.\
