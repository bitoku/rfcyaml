- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   TCP has a long history, and several proposed TCP extensions\
    \ have\n   never seen widespread deployment.  Section 5 of the TCP \"roadmap\"\
    \n   document [RFC4614] already classifies a number of TCP extensions as\n   Historic\
    \ and describes the reasons for doing so, but it does not\n   instruct the RFC\
    \ Editor and IANA to change the status of these RFCs\n   in the RFC database and\
    \ the relevant IANA registries.  The sole\n   purpose of this document is to do\
    \ just that.  Please refer to Section\n   5 of [RFC4614] for justification.\n"

  contents:
  - "2.  RFC Editor Considerations\n   Per this document, the RFC Editor has changed\

    \ on \"TCP Extensions for Long-Delay Paths\"\n   o  [RFC1106] and [RFC1110] related\
    \ to the \"TCP Big Window and Nak\n      Options\"\n   o  [RFC1145] and [RFC1146]\
