- title: 1. Scope of Applicability
  contents:
  - "1. Scope of Applicability\n   This document defines a SIP extension that can\
    \ be used to integrate\n   QoS admission control with call signaling and help\
    \ guard against\n   denial of service attacks.  The use of this extension is only\n\
    \   applicable in administrative domains, or among federations of\n   administrative\
    \ domains with previously agreed-upon policies, where\n   both the SIP proxy authorizing\
    \ the QoS, and the policy control of the\n   underlying network providing the\
    \ QoS, belong to that administrative\n   domain or federation of domains.  Furthermore,\
    \ the mechanism is\n   generally incompatible with end-to-end encryption of message\
    \ bodies\n   that describe media sessions.\n   This is in contrast with general\
    \ Internet principles, which separate\n   data transport from applications.  Thus,\
    \ the solution described in\n   this document is not applicable to the Internet\
    \ at large.  Despite\n   these limitations, there are sufficiently useful specialized\n\
    \   deployments that meet the assumptions described above, and can accept\n  \
    \ the limitations that result, to warrant informational publication of\n   this\
    \ mechanism.  An example deployment would be a closed network,\n   which emulates\
    \ a traditional circuit switched telephone network.\n   This document specifies\
    \ a private header, facilitating use in these\n   specialized configurations.\n"

- title: 3. Background and Motivation
  contents:
  - "3. Background and Motivation\n   Current IP telephony systems assume a perfect\
    \ world in which there is\n   either an unlimited amount of bandwidth, or network\
    \ layer Quality of\n   Service (QoS) is provided without any kind of policy control.\n\
    \   However, the reality is that end-to-end bandwidth is not unlimited\n   and\
    \ uncontrolled access to QoS, in general, is unlikely.  The primary\n   reason\
    \ for this is that QoS provides preferential treatment of one\n   flow, at the\
    \ expense of another.  Consequently, it is important to\n   have policy control\
    \ over whether a given flow should have access to\n   QoS.  This will not only\
    \ enable fairness in general, but can also\n   prevent denial of service attacks.\n\
    \   In this document, we are concerned with providing QoS for media\n   streams\
    \ established via the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) [3].\n   We assume an\
    \ architecture that integrates call signaling with media\n   authorization, as\
    \ illustrated in the Figure below.  The solid lines\n   (A and B) show interfaces,\
    \ whereas the dotted line (C) illustrates\n   the QoS enabled media flow:\n  \

    \                       Figure 1 - Basic Architecture\n   In this architecture,\
    \ we assume a SIP UA connected to a QoS enabled\n   network with an edge router\
    \ acting as a Policy Enforcement Point\n   (PEP) [6].  We further assume that\
    \ a SIP UA that wishes to obtain QoS\n   initiates sessions through a proxy which\
    \ can interface with the QoS\n   policy control for the data network being used.\
    \  We will refer to\n   such a proxy as a QoS enabled proxy.  We assume that the\
    \ SIP UA needs\n   to present an authorization token to the network in order to\
    \ obtain\n   Quality of Service (C).  The SIP UA obtains this authorization token\n\
    \   via SIP (A) from the QoS enabled proxy by means of an extension SIP\n   header,\
    \ defined in this document.  The proxy, in turn, communicates\n   either directly\
    \ with the edge router or with a Policy Decision Point\n   (PDP - not shown) [6]\
    \ in order to obtain a suitable authorization\n   token for the UA.\n   Examples\
    \ of access data networks, where such a QoS enabled proxy\n   could be used, include\
    \ DOCSIS based cable networks and 3rd generation\n   (3G) wireless networks.\n"
- title: 4. Overview
  contents:
  - "4. Overview\n   A session that needs to obtain QoS for the media streams in\n\
    \   accordance with our basic architecture described above goes through\n   the\
    \ following steps.\n   The SIP UA sends an INVITE to the QoS enabled proxy, which\
    \ for each\n   resulting dialog includes one or more media authorization tokens\
    \ in\n   all unreliable provisional responses (except 100), the first reliable\n\
    \   1xx or 2xx response, and all retransmissions of that reliable\n   response\
    \ for the dialog.  When the UA requests QoS, it includes the\n   media authorization\
    \ tokens with the resource reservation.\n   A SIP UA may also receive an INVITE\
    \ from its QoS enabled proxy which\n   includes one or more media authorization\
    \ tokens.  In that case, when\n   the UA requests QoS, it includes the media authorization\
    \ tokens with\n   the resource reservation.  The resource reservation mechanism\
    \ is not\n   part of SIP and is not described within the scope of this document.\n"

    \  ER-t, upon reception of the (12)RSVP-RESV message, checks the\n   authorization\

  - "7. Advantages of the Proposed Approach\n   The use of media authorization makes\
    \ it possible to control the usage\n   of network resources.  In turn, this makes\
    \ IP Telephony more robust\n   against denial of service attacks and various kinds\
    \ of service\n   frauds.  By using the authorization capability, the number of\
    \ flows,\n   and the amount of network resources reserved can be controlled,\n\
    \   thereby making the IP Telephony system dependable in the presence of\n   scarce\
    \ resources.\n"
- title: 8. Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "8. Security Considerations\n   In order to control access to QoS, a QoS enabled\
    \ proxy should\n   authenticate the UA before providing it with a media authorization\n\
    \   token.  Both the method and policy associated with such\n   authentication\
    \ are outside the scope of this document, however it\n   could, for example, be\
    \ done by using standard SIP authentication\n   mechanisms, as described in [3].\n\
    \   Media authorization tokens sent in the P-Media-Authorization header\n   from\
    \ a QoS enabled proxy to a UA MUST be protected from eavesdropping\n   and tampering.\
    \  This can, for example, be done through a mechanism\n   such as IPSec or TLS.\
    \  However, this will only provide hop-by-hop\n   security.  If there is one or\
    \ more intermediaries (e.g., proxies),\n   between the UA and the QoS enabled\
    \ proxy, these intermediaries will\n   have access to the P-Media-Authorization\
    \ header field value, thereby\n   compromising confidentiality and integrity.\
    \  This will enable both\n   theft-of-service and denial-of-service attacks against\
    \ the UA.\n   Consequently, the P-Media-Authorization header field MUST NOT be\n\
    \   available to any untrusted intermediary in the clear or without\n   integrity\
    \ protection.  There is currently no mechanism defined in SIP\n   that would satisfy\
    \ these requirements.  Until such a mechanism\n   exists, proxies MUST NOT send\
    \ P-Media-Authorization headers through\n   untrusted intermediaries, which might\
    \ reveal or modify the contents\n   of this header.  (Note that S/MIME-based encryption\
    \ in SIP is not\n   available to proxy servers, as proxies are not allowed to\
    \ add message\n   bodies.)\n   QoS enabled proxies may need to inspect message\
    \ bodies describing\n   media streams (e.g., SDP).  Consequently, such message\
    \ bodies should\n   not be encrypted.  In turn, this will prevent end-to-end\n\
    \   confidentiality of the said message bodies, which lowers the overall\n   security\
    \ possible.\n"
