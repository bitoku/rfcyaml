Abstract When carried over Layer 2 technologies such as Ethernet, IPv6 datagrams using Low Power Wireless Personal Area Network (LoWPAN) encapsulation as defined in RFC 4944 must be identified so the receiver can correctly interpret the encoded IPv6 datagram.
The IETF officially requested the assignment of an Ethertype for that purpose and this document reports that assignment.
The IETF defined "LoWPAN encapsulation", a format for IPv6 [RFC2460] datagram encapsulation [RFC4944].
This document regards any IPv6 datagram using the Dispatch octet as defined in Section 5.1 of RFC 4944 as using LoWPAN encapsulation.
LoWPAN encapsulation as defined in RFC 4944 has been updated by [RFC6282], and may be extended and modified by future IETF Standards.
The intended Layer 2 technology for IPv6 datagrams using LoWPAN encapsulation as originally defined is [IEEE.802.15.4 2011], which does not provide for a protocol switch in its Layer 2 headers.
The following list gives some example use cases for the Ethertype  based protocol dispatch for the LoWPAN
encapsulated IPv6 datagram:  Usage of LoWPAN encapsulation in conjunction with IEEE 802.15.9
Multiplexed Data Service [IEEE802159], which provides the ability to perform upper layer protocol dispatch for IEEE 802.15.4 networks.
Wi SUN Alliance intends to use the 15.9 Multiplexed Data Information Element for upper layer protocol dispatch.
As specified in IEEE 802.15.9, dispatch of LoWPAN encapsulation frames will require that an Ethertype be assigned for LoWPAN encapsulation.
LoWPAN encapsulation will likely be needed for Wi Fi Alliance's HaLoW [HALOW] standard (low power operation in the 900 MHz band).
Other Layer 2 technologies such as Ethernet and debugging tools such as Wireshark require a unique Protocol Type field for LoWPAN encapsulation to properly interpret IPv6 datagrams that use LoWPAN encapsulation.
Any existing or future Layer 2 technology, incorporating Ethertype based upper layer dispatch, can use the Ethertype proposed in this document to dispatch LoWPAN encapsulated IPv6 datagrams.
Assignment of an Ethertype by IEEE
The IETF formally submitted a request to IEEE for assignment of an Ethertype for IPv6 datagrams using LoWPAN encapsulation.
IEEE has responded with the assignment of Ethertype 0xA0ED for this purpose.
The assignment has been recorded by IEEE [IEEE ETHERTYPES].
The following entry has been added to the "ETHER TYPES" subregistry of the "IEEE 802 Numbers" registry [IANA IEEE802]: Ethertype (decimal): 41197 Ethertype (hex): A0ED Exp.
RFC 7973 (this document) 4.
This document only requests assignment of an Ethertype for IPv6 datagrams using LoWPAN encapsulation.
It has no incremental implications for security beyond those in the relevant protocols.
