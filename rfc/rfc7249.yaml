- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   In accordance with the IETF-IANA Memorandum of Understanding\n\
    \   [RFC2860], RFC 7020 [RFC7020] provides information about the Internet\n  \
    \ Numbers Registry System and how it is used in the distribution of\n   autonomous\
    \ system (AS) numbers and globally unique unicast Internet\n   Protocol (IP) address\
    \ space.\n   This companion document identifies the IANA registries that are part\n\
    \   of the Internet Numbers Registry System at this time.\n"
- title: 2.  Internet Numbers Registries
  contents:
  - "2.  Internet Numbers Registries\n   Three IANA registries are associated with\
    \ the Internet Numbers\n   Registry System: \"Autonomous System (AS) Numbers\"\
    , \"IANA IPv4 Address\n   Space Registry\", and \"IPv6 Global Unicast Address\
    \ Assignments\".\n   However, in each case, there are special-purpose values,\
    \ and those\n   special-purpose values are outside the Internet Numbers Registry\n\
    \   System.\n"
- title: 2.1.  Autonomous System Numbers
  contents:
  - "2.1.  Autonomous System Numbers\n   For historical reasons, there are 16-bit\
    \ AS numbers and 32-bit AS\n   numbers.  However, the 16-bit AS numbers are really\
    \ just zero through\n   65535 of the 32-bit AS number space.\n   The allocation\
    \ and registration functions for all non-reserved AS\n   numbers are handled by\
    \ the Internet Numbers Registry System in\n   accordance with policies developed\
    \ by the Regional Internet\n   Registries (RIRs) in accordance with their processes.\n\
    \   Some special-purpose AS numbers have been reserved.  Section 3 of\n   this\
    \ document establishes an IANA registry for special-purpose AS\n   Numbers that\
    \ have already been reserved.  Future additions to this\n   registry can be made\
    \ through \"IETF Review\" as defined in [RFC5226].\n   Once a reservation is approved,\
    \ it is recorded in the special-purpose\n   AS numbers registry with a reference\
    \ to the IESG-approved RFC that\n   documents the reservation.\n"
- title: 2.2.  IPv4 Addresses
  contents:
  - "2.2.  IPv4 Addresses\n   The allocation and registration functions for all non-reserved,\n\
    \   globally unique unicast IPv4 addresses are handled by the Internet\n   Numbers\
    \ Registry System in accordance with policies developed by the\n   RIRs in accordance\
    \ with their processes.\n   Reservations of special-purpose IPv4 addresses can\
    \ be found in the\n   IANA registry [IANA-IPv4-Reg].  Future additions to this\
    \ registry can\n   be made through \"IETF Review\" as defined in [RFC5226].  Once\
    \ a\n   reservation is approved, it is recorded in the special-purpose IPv4\n\
    \   address registry with a reference to the IESG-approved RFC that\n   documents\
    \ the reservation.\n"
- title: 2.3.  IPv6 Addresses
  contents:
  - "2.3.  IPv6 Addresses\n   The vast bulk of the IPv6 address space (approximately\
    \ 7/8ths of the\n   whole address space) is reserved by the IETF [RFC4291], with\
    \ the\n   expectation that further assignment of globally unique unicast\n   address\
    \ space will be made from this reserved space in accordance\n   with future needs.\n\
    \   The allocation and registration functions for all non-reserved\n   globally\
    \ unique unicast IPv6 addresses are handled by the Internet\n   Numbers Registry\
    \ System in accordance with policies developed by the\n   RIRs in accordance with\
    \ their processes.\n   Reservations of special-purpose IPv6 addresses can be found\
    \ in the\n   IANA registry [IANA-IPv6-Reg].  Future additions to this registry\
    \ can\n   be made through \"IETF Review\" as defined in [RFC5226].  Once a\n \
    \  reservation is approved, it is recorded in the special-purpose IPv6\n   address\
    \ registry with a reference to the IESG-approved RFC that\n   documents the reservation.\n"
- title: 3.  IANA Considerations
  contents:
  - "3.  IANA Considerations\n   IANA has created the \"Special-Purpose AS Numbers\"\
    \ registry.  Future\n   additions to this registry can be made through \"IETF\

  - "4.  Security Considerations\n   This document identifies the IANA registries\
    \ that are part of the\n   Internet Numbers Registry System at the time of publication.\
    \  It does\n   not change the security posture of the Internet in any way.\n \
    \  Network operators should take care that special-purpose numbers and\n   addresses\
    \ are used on the public Internet in a manner that is\n   consistent with their\
    \ reserved purpose.\n"
