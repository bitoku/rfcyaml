Abstract This document registers the Enumservice named "vmsg", which is used to facilitate the real time routing of voice, video, and unified communications to a messaging system.
three Enumservice types: "voicemsg", "videomsg", and "unifmsg".
Each type also registers the subtypes "sip", "sips", "http", and "https", as well as the subtype "tel" for the "voicemsg" type.
E.164 Number Mapping, RFC 3761 [1]) is a technology that transforms E.164 numbers (the International Public Telecommunication Numbering Plan, ITU T Recommendation E.164 [2]) into domain names and then uses DNS (Domain Name System, RFC 1034 [3]) delegation through NS records and Naming Authority Pointer (NAPTR)
records (Dynamic Delegation Discovery System (DDDS)
Part Three: The Domain Name System (DNS) Database, RFC 3403 [4])
to look up what services are available for a specific domain name.
This document registers Enumservices according to the guidelines given in RFC 3761 [1] to be used for provisioning in the services field of a NAPTR [4] resource record to indicate the types of functionality associated with an end point and/or telephone number.
The registration is defined within the DDDS
(Dynamic Delegation Discovery System [4][5][6][7][8]) hierarchy, for use with the "E2U" DDDS Application defined in RFC 3761.
Voice messaging systems are used widely with telephony and voice communication services.
The need for a voice messaging service type has become clear in order to provide certain applications with direct access to various voice messaging services (for example, voicemail), most typically via the use of SIP.
The authors considered the use of Voice Profile for Internet Mail (VPIM) [14] but found that VPIM was best suited to the non real time and non session based routing of a voice message once it had been deposited into a voice messaging system.
Thus, VPIM was a good solution for the non real time and non session based routing of voice messages between and within domains, but it did not enable real time interaction with a voice messaging system.
Thus, a need has been identified for this voice messaging service type that would enable, for example, some of the use cases listed in this section.
Video messaging systems, sometimes called visual voice messaging systems, are beginning to be used with real time communication services.
The need for a video messaging service type has become clear in order to provide certain applications with direct access to various video messaging services, most typically via the use of SIP.
Thus, a need has been identified for this video messaging service type that would enable, for example, some of the use cases listed in this section.
Finally, several service providers and software developers have indicated that their system for voice messaging and video messaging either have been or soon will be unified into a single system.
As such, they desired to have the option of using an Enumservice type that represents a subscriber's mailbox as being a so called unified messaging repository.
Thus, a need has been identified for this unified voice and video messaging service type that would enable, for example, some of the use cases listed in this section.
Selected Use Cases for Illustrative Purposes
The following is a partial, non exclusive list of use cases that the vmsg Enumservice could address:
A called party is busy or does not answer a call.
A client or server then determines that a messaging service should be used and sends the calling party's session to such a service.
The client or server needs to be able to determine which server to direct this real time session to, whether that is within or outside of the called party's domain.
Similar to the above use case, a real time session is attempted to a messaging system, but that system is currently unavailable.
Since multiple service type records may be returned by the original ENUM query, the client or server could then attempt to initiate a session with one or more backup messaging servers in a manner that is transparent to the calling party and that supports better overall availability of a messaging service.
Similar to the above use case, this service type could be used to balance load across multiple messaging servers, whether those are in the same or in different physical locations.
A user with an account on a messaging service needs to connect to the messaging service in order to retrieve messages.
They initiate a real time session, and an ENUM query is performed to discover the messaging server that holds its mailbox.
In the process of invoking and supporting a real time, automated and interactive session with a user, whether for message deposit or retrieval, VoiceXML files are referenced and utilized, via either HTTP or HTTPS.
Multiple VoiceXML servers could be associated with a user and returned via ENUM query, for the purposes of load balancing, for example.
Consideration of Other Existing Enumservices
The authors considered whether this service type could simply use the SIP Enumservice type [19], but found that it does not satisfy their voice messaging requirements, particularly given the non SIP URI sub  types specified herein.
Even with sub types for SIP URIs, however, there are challenges to using the SIP Enumservice type.
For example, a request for access to such a service could be extended to the requesting SIP client, or User Agent Client (UAC), rather than relying upon the local policy of a SIP server, or User Agent Server (UAS), which means that special routing logic within a UAS cannot be relied upon to solve this problem.
More importantly, however, the authors have found that without this service type, a UAC or UAS will be presented with multiple SIP URIs, with no ability other than in non standards based routing rules or application logic to recognize which one is related to a voice messaging, video messaging, or unified voice and video messaging service.
The authors believe that it is more likely that these records will be distributed on a purely private basis, but they may also be distributed in public ENUM trees.
Distribution of this NAPTR data could be either (a) on a private basis within a service provider's internal network, (b) on a private basis between one or more parties using a variety of security mechanisms to prohibit general public access, or (c) openly available.
Security Considerations DNS, as used by ENUM, is a global, distributed database.
Should implementers of this specification use e164.arpa or any other publicly available domain as the tree for maintaining voicemsg Enumservice data, this information would be visible to anyone anonymously.
While this is not qualitatively different from publication in a Telephone Directory, it does open or ease access to such data without any indication that such data has been accessed or by whom it has been accessed.
Such data harvesting by third parties is often used to generate lists of targets for unsolicited information.
Thus, a third party could use this to generate a list that it can use to make unsolicited telemarketing phone calls, or so called SPAM over Internet Telephony (SPIT).
Many countries have do not call registries or other legal or regulatory mechanisms in place to deal with such abuses.
As noted earlier, carriers, service providers, and other users may simply choose not to publish such information in the public e164.arpa tree, but may instead simply publish this in their internal ENUM routing database that is only able to be queried by trusted elements of their network and/or partner networks, such as softswitches and SIP proxy servers.
They may also choose to publish such information in a carrier only branch of the e164.arpa tree, should one be created.
Although an E.164 telephone number does not appear to reveal as much identity information about a user as a name in the format
username@hostname, the information is still publicly available; thus, there is still the risk of unwanted communication.
An analysis of threats specific to the dependence of ENUM on the DNS and the applicability of DNSSEC [16] to this is provided in RFC 3761 [1].
A thorough analysis of threats to the DNS itself is covered in RFC 3833 [17].

Selected Examples for Illustrative Purposes
The following sub sections document several examples that implementers may find informative.
These examples shall in no way limit the various forms that this Enumservice may take.
Example Using a 'sip' URI $ORIGIN 3.2.1.0.5.5.5.5.1.2.1.e164.arpa.
NAPTR 10 100 "u" "E2U voicemsg:sip" "!
In this example, a calling party has attempted a session that has gone unanswered after a certain period of time.
The calling party's session is sent to the appropriate voice messaging server, a personalized greeting is played to the calling party, after which it records a voice message to the called party.
Example Using a 'tel' URI $ORIGIN 3.2.1.0.5.5.5.5.1.2.1.e164.arpa.
NAPTR 10 100 "u" "E2U voicemsg:tel" "!
In this example, a calling party has attempted a session that has gone unanswered after a certain period of time.
The calling party's session is sent to the appropriate voice messaging server, a personalized greeting is played to the calling party, after which it records a voice message to the called party.
Example Using a 'sip' URI without a Telephone Number $
NAPTR 10 100 "u" "E2U voicemsg:sip" "!
In this example, a calling party has attempted a session that has gone unanswered after a certain period of time.
The calling party's session is sent to the appropriate voice messaging server, a personalized greeting is played to the calling party, after which it records a voice message to the called party.
The URI that this session is directed to does not include a telephone number, as this user has multiple service that are not particularly tied to telephone numbers whereby text, audio, video and other multimedia messages can be received and accessed.
Example of Failover Using E2U videomsg
NAPTR 10 100 "u" "E2U videomsg:sip" "!
NAPTR 10 200 "u" "E2U videomsg:sip" "!
In this example, the preference indicates that gw1.example.com is used first (100), and if this is unreachable, then the next higher preference (200) is used and gw2.example.com is contacted.
While out of scope for this document, a service provider could thus mirror or cluster a message store and fail from the primary to secondary using the DNS in an active standby mode.
When Multiple Records Are Returned
It is likely that both E2U sip and E2U voicemsg,
E2U videomsg, and/or E2U unifmsg Enumservice type records will be returned for a given query.
In this case, this could result in what is essentially E2U sip records for real time communications with an end user, while, for example, the E2U voicemsg records will be used for real time communications with a voice messaging service, when the called party is not available or does not wish to be disturbed.
Therefore, the network element that receives the results of this ENUM query will need to know enough information in order to select the voicemsg service type, rather than the sip service type.
In addition, it is likely that multiple E2U voicemsg, E2U videomsg,
and/or E2U unifmsg Enumservice type records will be returned for a given query.
In this case, multiple records may include order and preference to allow recursion or load balancing.
Order could be used to designate a primary and a backup voice, video, or unified voice and video messaging service.
Preference could be used to load balance across multiple voice, video, and/or unified voice and video messaging servers by weight, for example.
Finally, as with multiple records resulting from a typical ENUM query of the e164.arpa tree, it is up to the application using an ENUM resolver to determine which record(s) to use and which record(s) to ignore.
Implementers should take this into consideration and build logic into their applications that can select appropriately from multiple records based on business, network, or other rules.
NAPTR Configuration Issues Implementers may wish to consider using regular expressions in order to reduce the size of individual NAPTRs.
This will have a significant effect on the overall size of the database involved.
