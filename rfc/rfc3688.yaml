- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   Over the past few years, the Extensible Markup Language\
    \ (XML)\n   [W3C.REC-xml] has become a widely used method for data markup.  There\n\
    \   have already been several IETF Working Groups that have produced\n   standards\
    \ that define XML Document Type Definitions (DTDs), XML\n   Namespaces [W3C.REC-xml-names],\
    \ and XML Schemas [W3C.REC-xmlschema-\n   1]. Each one of these technologies uses\
    \ Uniform Resource Identifiers\n   (URIs) [RFC2396] and other standardized identifiers\
    \ to identify\n   various components.\n   For example, while it has been the practice\
    \ within some standards\n   that use Document Type Definitions (DTDs) to forego\
    \ the use of the\n   PUBLIC identifiers in favor of 'well known' SYSTEM identifiers,\
    \ it\n   has proven to be more trouble than its worth to attempt to\n   standardize\
    \ SYSTEM identifiers.  The result is that several IETF\n   standards that have\
    \ simply created non-resolvable URIs in order to\n   simply identify but not resolve\
    \ the DTD for some given XML document.\n   This document seeks to standardize\
    \ and improve these practices by\n   creating an IANA maintained registry of XML\
    \ element identifiers so\n   that document authors and implementors have a well\
    \ maintained and\n   authoritative location for their XML elements.  As part of\
    \ this\n   standard, the IANA will maintain:\n   o  the public representation\
    \ of the document,\n   o  the URI for the elements if one is provided at the time\
    \ of\n      registration,\n   o  a registry of Public Identifiers as URIs.\n \
    \  In the case where the registrant does not request a particular URI,\n   the\
    \ IANA will assign it a Uniform Resource Name (URN) that follows\n   [RFC3553].\n"

- title: 3.1.  The Assigned/Registered URI
  contents:
  - "3.1.  The Assigned/Registered URI\n   All elements (except PUBLIC identifiers)\
    \ in this registry will\n   require a URI in order to be registered.  If the registrant\
    \ wishes to\n   have a URI assigned, then a URN of the form\n      urn:ietf:params:xml:<class>:<id>\n\
    \   will be assigned where <class> is the type of the document being\n   registered\
    \ (see below).  <id> is a unique id generated by the IANA\n   based on any means\
    \ the IANA deems necessary to maintain uniqueness\n   and persistence.  NOTE:\
    \ in order for a URN of this type to be\n   assigned, the item being registered\
    \ MUST have been through the IETF\n   consensus process.  Basically, this means\
    \ that it must be documented\n   in a RFC.  The RFC 3553 [RFC3553] URN registration\
    \ template is found\n   in Section 6.\n   The IANA will also maintain a file server\
    \ available via at least HTTP\n   and FTP that contains all of the registered\
    \ elements in some publicly\n   accessible file space in the same way that all\
    \ of the IANA's\n   registered elements are available via\n   http://www.iana.org/assignments/.\
    \  While the directory structure of\n   this server is up to the IANA, it is suggested\
    \ that the files be\n   organized by the <class> and the individual files have\
    \ the <id> as\n   their filename.\n   Implementors are warned that they should\
    \ not programatically rely on\n   those resources being available or the directory\
    \ structure remaining\n   static for any reason.  It is explicitly recognized\
    \ that some\n   software tools attempt to download DTDs, schema, etc., 'on the\
    \ fly'\n   and that developers should understand when this is done and when to\n\
    \   not reference IANA network resources as a 'schema download\n   repository'.\
    \  This is the reason that the IANA will not register or\n   provide SYSTEM identifiers.\n"
- title: 3.2.  Registerable Classes
  contents:
  - "3.2.  Registerable Classes\n   The list of types of XML elements that can be\
    \ registered with the\n   IANA are:\n   publicid -- An XML document that contains\
    \ a DOCTYPE declaration or\n      any other external reference can identify that\
    \ reference via both\n      a PUBLIC identifier and a SYSTEM identifier.  The\
    \ SYSTEM\n      identifier is system-specific information that enables the entity\n\
    \      manager of an XML system to locate the file, memory location, or\n    \
    \  pointer within a file where the entity can be found.  It should\n      also\
    \ be noted that a system identifier could be an invocation of a\n      program\
    \ that controls access to an entity that is being\n      identified.  Thus, they\
    \ are not registered items.  In many cases,\n      SYSTEM identifiers are also\
    \ URIs.  However, in these cases, the\n      URI is still only used for system-specific\
    \ information.  In the\n      case where a PUBLIC Identifier is also a URI, it\
    \ is possible for\n      the SYSTEM Identifier to contain the same URI but this\
    \ behavior is\n      not recommended unless its side effects are well known and\n\
    \      understood to not cause any unacceptable harm.\n      A PUBLIC identifier\
    \ is a name that is intended to be meaningful\n      across systems and different\
    \ user environments.  Typically, it\n      will be a name that has a registered\
    \ owner associated with it, so\n      that public identifiers will be guaranteed\
    \ unique and no two\n      entities will have the same public identifier.  In\
    \ practice,\n      PUBLIC identifiers are typically Formal Public Identifiers\n\
    \      [ISO.8879.1986] but they are not restricted to just that set.  As\n   \
    \   said in [RFC3151]:\n         \"Any string which consists only of the public\
    \ identifier\n         characters (defined by Production 13 of Extensible Markup\n\
    \         Language (XML) 1.0 Second Edition) is a legal public\n         identifier.\"\
    \n      Therefore, it is legal for a PUBLIC identifier to be a URN if it\n   \
    \   adheres to the character set restrictions.\n      Thus, the identifier registered\
    \ along with a DTD is its PUBLIC\n      identifier.  The only restriction being\
    \ that it must adhere to the\n      character set restrictions.  In the case where\
    \ the registrant does\n      not provide one, the IANA will assign one of the\
    \ form\n      'urn:ietf:params:xml:pi:<id>'.  Registrants are encouraged to\n\
    \      investigate RFC  3151 [RFC3151] as a recommended method for\n      minting\
    \ a URN that can also be represented as an FPI.\n   ns -- XML Namespaces [W3C.REC-xml-names]\
    \ are named by a URI.  They\n      have no real, machine-parseable representation.\
    \  Thus, the\n      registered document will be either the specification or a\n\
    \      reference to it.  In the case where a URI is not provided by the\n    \
    \  registrant, the IANA will assign a URN of the form\n      'urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:<id>\
    \ which will be the XML Namespace's\n      name.\n   schema -- XML Schemas [W3C.REC-xmlschema-1]\
    \ are also identified by a\n      URI but their contents are machine parseable.\
    \  The IANA registered\n      document will be the XML Schema file.  The URN the\
    \ IANA assigns\n      can be used as the URI for the schema and is of the form\n\
    \      'urn:ietf:params:xml:schema:<id>'.\n   rdfschema -- The Resource Description\
    \ Format (RDF)\n      [W3C.CR-rdf-schema] is an XML serialization of a connected\
    \ graph\n      based data model used for metadata expression.  RDF makes use of\n\
    \      schemas for RDF that express grammars about relationships between\n   \
    \   URIs.  These grammars are identified by URIs.  The URN assigned by\n     \
    \ the IANA can be used as the identifying URI and is of the form\n      'urn:ietf:params:xml:rdfschema:<id>'.\n"
- title: 4.  Registration Procedures
  contents:
  - "4.  Registration Procedures\n   Until the IANA requests or implements an automated\
    \ process for the\n   registration of these elements, any specifications must\
    \ make that\n   request part of the IANA considerations section of their respective\n\
    \   documents.  That request must be in the form of the following\n   template:\n\
    \   URI\n      The URI or PUBLIC identifier that identifies the XML component.\
    \ If\n      the registrant is requesting that the IANA assign a URI then this\n\
    \      field should be specified as \"please assign\".\n   Registrant Contact\n\
    \      The individual/organization that is the registration contact for\n    \
    \  the component being registered.  Ideally, this will be the name\n      and\
    \ pertinent physical and network contact information.  In the\n      case of IETF\
    \ developed standards, the Registrant will be the IESG.\n   XML\n      The exact\
    \ XML to be stored in the registry.  Unless the beginning\n      and end of the\
    \ file is obvious, the document should use the text\n      \"BEGIN\" to mark the\
    \ beginning of the file and \"END\" to mark the\n      end of the file.  The IANA\
    \ will insert any text between those two\n      strings (minus any page breaks\
    \ and RFC formatting inserted by the\n      RFC Editor) into the file kept in\
    \ the repository.\n"
- title: 5.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "5.  Security Considerations\n   The information maintained by the IANA will be\
    \ authoritative and will\n   be a target for attack.  In some cases, such as XML\
    \ Schema and DTDs,\n   the content maintained by the IANA may be directly input\
    \ into\n   software.  Thus, extra care should be taken by the IANA to maintain\n\
    \   the security precautions required for an important reference location\n  \
    \ for the Internet.\n   Beyond this concern, there are no other security considerations\
    \ not\n   already found with any other IANA registry.\n"
- title: 6.  IANA Considerations
  contents:
  - "6.  IANA Considerations\n   This document seeks to create a rather large registry\
    \ for which the\n   IANA (at the direction of the IESG) will be primarily responsible.\n\
    \   The amount of effort required to maintain this registry is not\n   insignificant\
    \ and the policies and procedures surrounding any\n   approval process are non-trivial.\
    \  The registry is on a First Come\n   First Served basis, but a Specification\
    \ is Required.  Once the IETF\n   has some experience with this registry, these\
    \ policies may change.\n   RFC 3553 [RFC3553] specifies that any new registry\
    \ requiring a name,\n   to be assigned below the 'urn:ietf:params' namespace and\
    \ must specify\n   the structure of that space in template form.  The IANA has\
    \ created\n   and will maintain this new sub-namespace:\n   Registry-name: xml\n\
    \   Specification: This document contains the registry specification.\n      The\
    \ namespace is organized with one sub-namespace which is the\n      <id>.\n  \
