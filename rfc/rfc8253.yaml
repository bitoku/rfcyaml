  - "1.  Introduction\n   The Path Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCEP)\
    \ [RFC5440]\n   defines the mechanisms for the communication between a Path\n\
    \   Computation Client (PCC) and a Path Computation Element (PCE), or\n   between\
    \ two PCEs.  These interactions include requests and replies\n   that can be critical\
    \ for a sustainable network operation and adequate\n   resource allocation; therefore,\
    \ appropriate security becomes a key\n   element in the PCE infrastructure.  As\
    \ the applications of the PCE\n   framework evolve and more complex service patterns\
    \ emerge, the\n   definition of a secure mode of operation becomes more relevant.\n\
    \   The Security Considerations section of [RFC5440] analyzes the\n   potential\
    \ threats to PCEP and their consequences; it also discusses\n   several mechanisms\
    \ for protecting PCEP against security attacks,\n   without making a specific\
    \ recommendation on a particular one or\n   defining their application in depth.\
    \  Moreover, [RFC6952] states the\n   importance of ensuring PCEP communication\
    \ confidentiality, especially\n   when PCEP communication endpoints do not reside\
    \ in the same\n   Autonomous System (AS), as the interception of PCEP messages\
    \ could\n   leak sensitive information related to computed paths and resources.\n\
    \   Transport Layer Security (TLS) [RFC5246] is one of the solutions that\n  \
    \ seems most adequate among those mentioned in these documents, as it\n   provides\
    \ support for peer authentication, message encryption, and\n   integrity.  TLS\
    \ provides well-known mechanisms to support key\n   configuration and exchange,\
    \ as well as means to perform security\n   checks on the results of PCE Discovery\
    \ (PCED) procedures via the\n   Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP) [RFC5088] [RFC5089].\n\
    \   This document describes a security container for the transport of\n   PCEP\
    \ messages; therefore, it does not affect the flexibility and\n   extensibility\
    \ of PCEP.\n   This document describes how to apply TLS to secure interactions\
    \ with\n   PCE, including initiation of the TLS procedures, the TLS handshake\n\
    \   mechanism, the TLS methods for peer authentication, the applicable\n   TLS\
    \ ciphersuites for data exchange, and the handling of errors in the\n   security\
    \ checks.  In the rest of this document, we refer to this\n   usage of TLS to\
    \ provide a secure transport for PCEP as \"PCEPS\".\n   Within this document,\
    \ PCEP communications are described through a\n   PCC-PCE relationship.  The PCE\
    \ architecture also supports PCE-PCE\n   communication; this is achieved by requesting\
    \ the PCE to fill the\n   role of a PCC, as usual.  Thus, in this document, the\
    \ PCC refers to a\n   PCC or a PCE initiating the PCEP session and acting as a\
    \ client.\n"

  - "3.1.  Overview\n   The steps involved in establishing a PCEPS session are as\
    \ follows:\n   1.  Establishment of a TCP connection.\n   2.  Initiation of the\
    \ TLS procedures by the StartTLS message from PCE\n       to PCC and from PCC\
    \ to PCE.\n   3.  Negotiation and establishment of a TLS connection.\n   4.  Start\
    \ exchange of PCEP messages as per [RFC5440].\n   This document uses the standard\
    \ StartTLS procedure in PCEP instead of\n   using a different port for the secured\
    \ session.  This is done to\n   avoid requesting allocation of another port number\
    \ for PCEPS.  The\n   StartTLS procedure makes more efficient use of scarce port\
    \ numbers\n   and allows simpler configuration of PCEP.\n   Implementations SHOULD\
    \ follow the best practices and recommendations\n   for using TLS, as per [RFC7525].\n\
    \   It should be noted that this procedure updates what is defined in\n   Sections\
    \ 4.2.1 and 6.7 of [RFC5440] regarding the initialization\n   phase and the processing\
    \ of messages prior to the Open message.  The\n   details of processing, including\
    \ backward compatibility, are\n   discussed in the following sections.\n"
- title: 3.2.  Initiating TLS Procedures
  contents:
  - "3.2.  Initiating TLS Procedures\n   Since PCEP can operate either with or without\
    \ TLS, it is necessary\n   for a PCEP speaker to indicate whether it wants to\
    \ set up a TLS\n   connection or not.  For this purpose, this document specifies\
    \ a new\n   PCEP message called \"StartTLS\".  Thus, the PCEP session is secured\n\
    \   via TLS from the start, before the exchange of any other PCEP message\n  \
    \ (including the Open message).  This document thus updates [RFC5440],\n   which\
    \ requires the Open message to be the first PCEP message that is\n   exchanged.\
    \  In the case of a PCEP session using TLS, the StartTLS\n   message will be sent\
    \ first.  Also, a PCEP speaker that supports PCEPS\n   MUST NOT start the OpenWait\
    \ timer after the TCP establishment;\n   instead, it starts a StartTLSWait timer\
    \ as described in Section 3.3.\n   The PCEP speaker MAY discover that the PCEP\
    \ peer supports PCEPS or\n   can be preconfigured to use PCEPS for a given peer\
    \ (see Section 4 for\n   more details).  An existing PCEP session cannot be secured\
    \ via TLS;\n   the session MUST be closed and re-established with TLS as per the\n\
    \   procedure described in this document.\n   The StartTLS message is a PCEP message\
    \ sent by a PCC to a PCE and by\n   a PCE to a PCC in order to initiate the TLS\
    \ procedure for PCEP.  The\n   PCC initiates the use of TLS by sending a StartTLS\
    \ message.  The PCE\n   agrees to the use of TLS by responding with its own StartTLS\
    \ message.\n   If the PCE is configured to only support TLS, it may send the\n\
    \   StartTLS message immediately upon TCP connection establishment;\n   otherwise,\
    \ it MUST wait to see if the PCC's first message is an Open\n   or a StartTLS\
    \ message.  The TLS negotiation and establishment\n   procedures are triggered\
    \ once the PCEP speaker has sent and received\n   the StartTLS message.  The Message-Type\
    \ field of the PCEP common\n   header for the StartTLS message is set to 13.\n\
    \   Once the TCP connection has been successfully established, the first\n   message\
    \ sent by the PCC to the PCE and by the PCE to the PCC MUST be\n   a StartTLS\
    \ message for PCEPS.  Note that this is a significant change\n   from [RFC5440],\
    \ where the first PCEP message is the Open message.\n   A PCEP speaker receiving\
    \ a StartTLS message, after any other PCEP\n   exchange has taken place (by receiving\
    \ or sending any other messages\n   from either side), MUST treat it as an unexpected\
    \ message and reply\n   with a PCEP Error (PCErr) message with Error-Type set\
    \ to 25 (PCEP\n   StartTLS failure) and Error-value set to 1 (Reception of StartTLS\n\
    \   after any PCEP exchange), and it MUST close the TCP connection.\n   Any message\
    \ received prior to the StartTLS or Open message MUST\n   trigger a protocol error\
    \ condition causing a PCErr message to be sent\n   with Error-Type set to 25 (PCEP\
    \ StartTLS failure) and Error-value set\n   to 2 (Reception of any other message\
    \ apart from StartTLS, Open, or\n   PCErr), and it MUST close the TCP connection.\n\
    \   If the PCEP speaker that does not support PCEPS receives a StartTLS\n   message,\
    \ it will behave according to the existing error mechanism\n   described in Section\
    \ 6.2 of [RFC5440] (if the message is received\n   prior to an Open message) or\
    \ Section 6.9 of [RFC5440] (if an unknown\n   message is received).  See Section\
    \ 5 for more details.\n   If the PCEP speaker that only supports PCEPS connections\
    \ (as a local\n   policy) receives an Open message, it MUST treat it as an unexpected\n\
    \   message and reply with a PCErr message with Error-Type set to 1 (PCEP\n  \
    \ session establishment failure) and Error-value set to 1 (reception of\n   an\
    \ invalid Open message or a non Open message), and it MUST close the\n   TCP connection.\n\
    \   If a PCC supports PCEPS connections and allows non-PCEPS connections\n   (as\
    \ a local policy), it MUST first try to establish PCEPS by sending\n   a StartTLS\
    \ message, and in case it receives a PCErr message from the\n   PCE, it MAY retry\
    \ to establish a connection without PCEPS by sending\n   an Open message.  If\
    \ a PCE supports PCEPS connections and allows\n   non-PCEPS connections (as a\
    \ local policy), it MUST wait to respond\n   after TCP establishment, based on\
    \ the message received from the PCC.\n   In case of a StartTLS message, the PCE\
    \ MUST respond by sending a\n   StartTLS message and moving to TLS establishment\
    \ procedures as\n   described in this document.  In case of an Open message, the\
    \ PCE MUST\n   respond with an Open message and move to the PCEP session\n   establishment\
    \ procedure as per [RFC5440].  If a PCE supports PCEPS\n   connections only (as\
    \ a local policy), it MAY send a StartTLS message\n   to the PCC without waiting\
    \ to receive a StartTLS message from the\n   PCC.\n   If a PCEP speaker that is\
    \ unwilling or unable to negotiate TLS\n   receives a StartTLS message, it MUST\
    \ return a PCErr message (in the\n   clear) with Error-Type set to 25 (PCEP StartTLS\
    \ failure) and Error-\n   value set to:\n   o  3 (Failure, connection without\
    \ TLS is not possible) if it is not\n      willing to exchange PCEP messages without\
    \ the solicited TLS\n      connection, and it MUST close the TCP session.\n  \
    \ o  4 (Failure, connection without TLS is possible) if it is willing\n      to\
    \ exchange PCEP messages without the solicited TLS connection,\n      and it MUST\
    \ close the TCP session.  The receiver MAY choose to\n      attempt to re-establish\
    \ the PCEP session without TLS next.\n      Re-establishing the PCEP session without\
    \ TLS SHOULD be limited to\n      only one attempt.\n   If the PCEP speaker supports\
    \ PCEPS and can establish a TLS\n   connection, it MUST start the TLS connection\
    \ negotiation and\n   establishment steps described in Section 3.4 before the\
    \ PCEP\n   initialization procedure (see Section 4.2.1 of [RFC5440]).\n   After\
    \ the exchange of StartTLS messages, if the TLS negotiation fails\n   for some\
    \ reason (e.g., the required mechanisms for certificate\n   revocation checking\
    \ are not available), both peers MUST immediately\n   close the connection.\n\
    \   A PCEP speaker that does not support PCEPS sends the Open message\n   directly,\
    \ as per [RFC5440].  A PCEP speaker that supports PCEPS, but\n   has learned in\
    \ the last exchange the peer's willingness to\n   re-establish the session without\
    \ TLS, MAY send the Open message\n   directly, as per [RFC5440].  Re-establishing\
    \ the PCEP session without\n   TLS SHOULD be limited to only one attempt.\n  \
    \ Given the asymmetric nature of TLS for connection establishment, it\n   is relevant\
    \ to identify the roles of each of the PCEP peers in it.\n   The PCC SHALL act\
    \ as the TLS client, and the PCE SHALL act as the TLS\n   server as per [RFC5246].\n\
    \   As per the recommendation from [RFC7525] to avoid downgrade attacks,\n   PCEP\
    \ peers that support PCEPS SHOULD default to strict TLS\n   configuration, i.e.,\
    \ not allowing non-TLS PCEP sessions to be\n   established.  PCEPS implementations\
    \ MAY provide an option to allow\n   the operator to manually override strict\
    \ TLS configuration and allow\n   unsecured connections.  Execution of this override\
    \ SHOULD trigger a\n   warning about the security implications of permitting unsecured\n\
    \   connections.\n"

  contents:
  - "3.3.  The StartTLS Message\n   The StartTLS message is used to initiate the TLS\
    \ procedure for a\n   PCEPS session between the PCEP peers.  A PCEP speaker sends\
    \ the\n   StartTLS message to request negotiation and establishment of a TLS\n\
    \   connection for PCEP.  On receiving a StartTLS message from the PCEP\n   peer\
    \ (i.e., when the PCEP speaker has sent and received the StartTLS\n   message),\
    \ it is ready to start the negotiation and establishment of\n   TLS and move to\
    \ the steps described in Section 3.4.\n   The collision resolution procedures\
    \ described in [RFC5440] for the\n   exchange of Open messages MUST be applied\
    \ by the PCEP peers during\n   the exchange of StartTLS messages.\n   The format\
    \ of a StartTLS message is as follows:\n      <StartTLS Message>::= <Common Header>\n\
    \   The StartTLS message MUST contain only the PCEP common header with\n   the\
    \ Message-Type field set to 13.\n   Once the TCP connection has been successfully\
    \ established, the PCEP\n   speaker MUST start a timer called the \"StartTLSWait\
    \ timer\".  After\n   the expiration of this timer, if neither the StartTLS message\
    \ nor a\n   PCErr/Open message (in case of failure and PCEPS not being supported\n\
    \   by the peer, respectively) has been received, the PCEP speaker MUST\n   send\
    \ a PCErr message with Error-Type set to 25 (PCEP StartTLS\n   failure) and Error-value\
    \ set to 5 (No StartTLS message (nor PCErr/\n   Open) before StartTLSWait timer\
    \ expiry), and it MUST release the TCP\n   connection.  A RECOMMENDED value for\
    \ the StartTLSWait timer is 60\n   seconds.  The value of the StartTLSWait timer\
    \ MUST NOT be less than\n   that of the OpenWait timer.\n   The following figures\

  - "3.4.  TLS Connection Establishment\n   Once the establishment of TLS has been\
    \ agreed upon by the PCEP peers,\n   the connection establishment SHALL follow\
    \ the following steps:\n   1.  Immediately negotiate a TLS session according to\
    \ [RFC5246].  The\n       following restrictions apply:\n       *  Support for\
    \ TLS v1.2 [RFC5246] or later is REQUIRED.\n       *  Support for certificate-based\
    \ mutual authentication is\n          REQUIRED.\n       *  Negotiation of a ciphersuite\
    \ providing for integrity\n          protection is REQUIRED.\n       *  Negotiation\
    \ of a ciphersuite providing for confidentiality is\n          RECOMMENDED.\n\
    \       *  Support for and negotiation of compression is OPTIONAL.\n       * \
    \ PCEPS implementations MUST, at a minimum, support negotiation\n          of\
    \ the TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256 [RFC6460] and\n          SHOULD\
    \ support TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384 as\n          well.  Implementations\
    \ SHOULD support the NIST P-256\n          (secp256r1) curve [RFC4492].  In addition,\
    \ PCEPS\n          implementations MUST support negotiation of the\n         \
    \ mandatory-to-implement ciphersuites required by the versions\n          of TLS\
    \ that they support from TLS 1.3 onwards.\n   2.  Peer authentication can be performed\
    \ in any of the following two\n       REQUIRED operation models:\n       *  TLS\
    \ with X.509 certificates using Public-Key Infrastructure\n          Exchange\
    \ (PKIX) trust models:\n          +  Implementations MUST allow the configuration\
    \ of a list of\n             trusted Certification Authorities (CAs) for incoming\n\
    \             connections.\n          +  Certificate validation MUST include the\
    \ verification rules\n             as per [RFC5280].\n          +  PCEPS implementations\
    \ SHOULD incorporate revocation methods\n             (Certificate Revocation\
    \ List (CRL) downloading, Online\n             Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP),\
    \ etc.) according to the\n             trusted CA policies.\n          +  Implementations\
    \ SHOULD indicate their trusted CAs.  For TLS\n             1.2, this is done\
    \ using \"certificate_authorities\" on the\n             server side (see Section\
    \ 7.4.4 of [RFC5246]) and the\n             \"TrustedAuthorities\" extension on\
    \ the client side (see\n             Section 6 of [RFC6066]).\n          +  Implementations\
    \ MUST follow the rules and guidelines for\n             peer validation as defined\
    \ in [RFC6125].  If an expected\n             DNS name or IP address for the peer\
    \ is configured, then the\n             implementations MUST check them against\
    \ the values in the\n             presented certificate.  The DNS names and the\
    \ IP addresses\n             can be contained in the Common Name Identifier (CN-ID)\n\
    \             [RFC6125] or the subjectAltName entries.  For verification,\n  \
    \           only one of these entries is considered.  The following\n        \
    \     precedence applies: for DNS name validation, DNS-ID\n             [RFC6125]\
    \ has precedence over CN-ID, and for IP address\n             validation, subjectAltName:iPAddr\
    \ has precedence over\n             CN-ID.\n          +  Implementations MAY allow\
    \ the configuration of a set of\n             additional properties of the certificate\
    \ to check for a\n             peer's authorization to communicate (e.g., a set\
    \ of allowed\n             values in URI-ID [RFC6125] or a set of allowed X.509\
    \ v3\n             Certificate Policies).  The definitions of these properties\n\
    \             are out of scope of this document.\n       *  TLS with X.509 certificates\
    \ using certificate fingerprints:\n          Implementations MUST allow the configuration\
    \ of a list of\n          certificates that are trusted to identify peers, identified\n\
    \          via the fingerprint of certificate octets encoded by the\n        \
    \  Distinguished Encoding Rules (DER).  Implementations MUST\n          support\
    \ SHA-256 as defined by [SHS] as the hash algorithm for\n          the fingerprint,\
    \ but a later revision may demand support for a\n          stronger hash function.\n\
    \   3.  Start exchanging PCEP messages.\n       *  Once the TLS connection has\
    \ been successfully established, the\n          PCEP speaker MUST start the OpenWait\
    \ timer [RFC5440]; after\n          the expiration of this timer, if no Open message\
    \ has been\n          received, the PCEP speaker sends a PCErr message and releases\n\
    \          the TCP/TLS connection.\n"
- title: 3.5.  Peer Identity
  contents:
  - "3.5.  Peer Identity\n   Depending on the peer authentication method in use, PCEPS\
    \ supports\n   different operation modes to establish a peer's identity and whether\n\
    \   it is entitled to perform requests or can be considered authoritative\n  \
    \ in its replies.  PCEPS implementations SHOULD provide mechanisms for\n   associating\
    \ peer identities with different levels of access and/or\n   authoritativeness,\
    \ and they MUST provide a mechanism for establishing\n   a default level for properly\
    \ identified peers.  Any connection\n   established with a peer that cannot be\
    \ properly identified SHALL be\n   terminated before any PCEP exchange takes place.\n\
    \   In TLS X.509 mode using fingerprints, a peer is uniquely identified\n   by\
    \ the fingerprint of the presented certificate.\n   There are numerous trust models\
    \ in PKIX environments, and it is\n   beyond the scope of this document to define\
    \ how a particular\n   deployment determines whether a peer is trustworthy.  Implementations\n\
    \   that want to support a wide variety of trust models should expose as\n   many\
    \ details of the presented certificate to the administrator as\n   possible so\
    \ that the trust model can be implemented by the\n   administrator.  At least\
    \ the following parameters of the X.509\n   certificate SHOULD be exposed:\n \
    \  o  Peer's IP Address\n   o  Peer's Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN)\n   o\
    \  Certificate Fingerprint\n   o  Issuer\n   o  Subject\n   o  All X.509 v3 Extended\
    \ Key Usage\n   o  All X.509 v3 Subject Alternative Name\n   o  All X.509 v3 Certificate\
    \ Policies\n   Note that the remote IP address used for the TCP session\n   establishment\
    \ is also exposed.\n   [RFC8232] specifies a Speaker Entity Identifier TLV\n \
    \  (SPEAKER-ENTITY-ID) as an optional TLV that is included in the OPEN\n   object.\
    \  It contains a unique identifier for the node that does not\n   change during\
    \ the lifetime of the PCEP speaker.  An implementation\n   would thus expose the\
    \ speaker entity identifier as part of the X.509\n   v3 certificate's subjectAltName:otherName,\
    \ so that an implementation\n   could use this identifier for the peer identification\
    \ trust model.\n   In addition, a PCC MAY apply the procedures described in \"\
    DNS-Based\n   Authentication of Named Entities (DANE)\" [RFC6698] to verify its\
    \ peer\n   identity when using DNS discovery.  See Section 4.1 for further\n \
    \  details.\n"
- title: 3.6.  Connection Establishment Failure
  contents:
  - "3.6.  Connection Establishment Failure\n   In case the initial TLS negotiation\
    \ or the peer identity check fails,\n   according to the procedures listed in\
    \ this document, both peers MUST\n   immediately close the connection.\n   The\
    \ initiator SHOULD follow the procedure listed in [RFC5440] to\n   retry session\
    \ setup as per the exponential back-off session\n   establishment retry procedure.\n"

  contents:
  - "4.  Discovery Mechanisms\n   This document does not specify any discovery mechanism\
    \ for support of\n   PCEPS.  [PCE-DISCOVERY-PCEPS-SUPPORT] and [PCE-DISCOVERY-DNS]\
    \ make\n   the following proposals:\n   o  A PCE can advertise its capability\
    \ to support PCEPS using the\n      IGP's advertisement mechanism of the PCED\
    \ information.  The\n      PCE-CAP-FLAGS sub-TLV is an optional sub-TLV used to\
    \ advertise PCE\n      capabilities.  It is present within the PCED sub-TLV carried\
    \ by\n      OSPF or IS-IS.  [RFC5088] and [RFC5089] provide the description\n\
    \      and processing rules for this sub-TLV when carried within OSPF and\n  \
    \    IS-IS, respectively.  PCE capability bits are defined in\n      [RFC5088].\
    \  A new capability flag bit for the PCE-CAP-FLAGS\n      sub-TLV that can be\
    \ announced as an attribute to distribute PCEP\n      security support information\
    \ is proposed in\n      [PCE-DISCOVERY-PCEPS-SUPPORT].\n   o  A PCE can advertise\
    \ its capability to support PCEPS using DNS\n      [PCE-DISCOVERY-DNS] by identifying\
    \ the support of TLS.\n"
- title: 4.1.  DANE Applicability
  contents:
  - "4.1.  DANE Applicability\n   DANE [RFC6698] defines a secure method to associate\
    \ the certificate\n   that is obtained from a TLS server with a domain name using\
    \ DNS,\n   i.e., using the TLSA DNS resource record (RR) to associate a TLS\n\
    \   server certificate or public key with the domain name where the\n   record\
    \ is found, thus forming a \"TLSA certificate association\".  The\n   DNS information\
    \ needs to be protected by DNS Security (DNSSEC).  A\n   PCC willing to apply\
    \ DANE to verify server identity MUST conform to\n   the rules defined in Section\
    \ 4 of [RFC6698].  The implementation MUST\n   support service certificate constraint\
    \ (TLSA certificate usages type\n   1) with Matching type 1 (SHA2-256) as described\
    \ in [RFC6698] and\n   [RFC7671].  The server's domain name must be authorized\
    \ separately,\n   as TLSA does not provide any useful authorization guarantees.\n"
- title: 5.  Backward Compatibility
  contents:
  - "5.  Backward Compatibility\n   The procedures described in this document define\
    \ a security container\n   for the transport of PCEP requests and replies carried\

    \   (StartTLS) that does not interfere with PCEP speaker implementations\n   not\

    \ as the\n   first message on TCP establishment.  A PCE that only supports PCEPS\n\
    \   will send a StartTLS message on TCP establishment.  The PCC would\n   consider\

    \ error mechanism of [RFC5440], i.e., it\n   would send a PCErr message with Error-Type\
    \ 1 (PCEP session\n   establishment failure) and Error-value 1 (reception of an\
    \ invalid\n   Open message or a non Open message) and close the session.\n   A\
    \ PCC that support PCEPS will send a StartTLS message as the first\n   message\
    \ on TCP establishment.  A PCE that does not support PCEPS\n   would consider\
    \ receiving a StartTLS message as an error, respond with\n   a PCErr message with\
    \ Error-Type 1 (PCEP session establishment\n   failure) and Error-value 1 (reception\
    \ of an invalid Open message or a\n   non Open message), and close the session.\n\
    \   If a StartTLS message is received at any other time by a PCEP speaker\n  \
    \ that does not implement PCEPS, it would consider it as an unknown\n   message\
    \ and would behave according to the existing error mechanism of\n   [RFC5440],\
    \ i.e., it would send a PCErr message with Error-Type 2\n   (Capability not supported)\
    \ and close the session.\n   An existing PCEP session cannot be upgraded to PCEPS;\
    \ the session\n   needs to be terminated and re-established as per the procedure\n\
    \   described in this document.  During the incremental upgrade, the PCEP\n  \
    \ speaker SHOULD allow session establishment with and without TLS.\n   Once both\
    \ PCEP speakers are upgraded to support PCEPS, the PCEP\n   session is re-established\
    \ with TLS; otherwise, a PCEP session without\n   TLS is set up.  A redundant\
    \ PCE MAY also be used during the\n   incremental deployment to take over the\
    \ PCE undergoing upgrade.  Once\n   the upgrade is completed, support for the\
    \ unsecured version SHOULD be\n   removed.\n   A PCE that accepts connections\
    \ with or without PCEPS would respond\n   based on the message received from the\
    \ PCC.  A PCC that supports\n   connection with or without PCEPS would first attempt\
    \ to connect with\n   PCEPS, and in case of error, it MAY retry to establish connection\n\
    \   without PCEPS.  For successful TLS operations with PCEP, both PCEP\n   peers\
    \ in the network would need to be upgraded to support this\n   document.\n   Note\
    \ that a PCEP implementation that supports PCEPS would respond\n   with a PCErr\
    \ message with Error-Type set to 25 (PCEP StartTLS\n   failure) and Error-value\
    \ set to 2 (Reception of any other message\n   apart from StartTLS, Open, or PCErr)\
    \ if any other message is sent\n   before a StartTLS or Open message.  If the\
    \ sender of the invalid\n   message is a PCEP implementation that does not support\
    \ PCEPS, it will\n   not be able to understand this error.  A PCEPS implementation\
    \ could\n   also send the PCErr message as per [RFC5440] with Error-Type 1 (PCEP\n\
    \   session establishment failure) and Error-value 1 (reception of an\n   invalid\
    \ Open message or a non Open message) before closing the\n   session.\n"

  contents:
  - "7.  Security Considerations\n   While the application of TLS satisfies the requirement\
    \ on\n   confidentiality as well as fine-grained, policy-based peer\n   authentication,\
    \ there are security threats that it cannot address.\n   It may be advisable to\
    \ apply additional protection measures, in\n   particular in what relates to attacks\
    \ specifically addressed to\n   forging the TCP connection underpinning TLS, especially\
    \ in the case\n   of long-lived connections.  One of these measures is the application\n\
    \   of the TCP Authentication Option (TCP-AO) [RFC5925], which is fully\n   compatible\
    \ with and deemed as complementary to TLS.  The mechanisms\n   to configure the\
    \ requirements to use TCP-AO and other lower-layer\n   protection measures with\
    \ a particular peer are outside the scope of\n   this document.\n   Since computational\
    \ resources required by the TLS handshake and\n   ciphersuite are higher than\
    \ unencrypted TCP, clients connecting to a\n   PCEPS server can more easily create\
    \ high-load conditions, and a\n   malicious client might create a denial-of-service\
    \ attack more easily.\n   Some TLS ciphersuites only provide integrity validation\
    \ of their\n   payload and provide no encryption; such ciphersuites SHOULD NOT\
    \ be\n   used by default.  Administrators MAY allow the usage of these\n   ciphersuites\
    \ after careful weighting of the risk of relevant internal\n   data leakage that\
    \ can occur in such a case, as explicitly stated by\n   [RFC6952].\n   When using\
    \ certificate fingerprints to identify PCEPS peers, any two\n   certificates that\
    \ produce the same hash value will be considered the\n   same peer.  Therefore,\
    \ it is important to make sure that the hash\n   function used is cryptographically\
    \ uncompromised, so that attackers\n   are very unlikely to be able to produce\
    \ a hash collision with a\n   certificate of their choice.  This document mandates\
    \ support for\n   SHA-256 as defined by [SHS], but a later revision may demand\
    \ support\n   for stronger functions if suitable attacks on it are known.\n  \
    \ PCEPS implementations that continue to accept connections without TLS\n   are\
    \ susceptible to downgrade attacks as described in [RFC7457].  An\n   attacker\
    \ could attempt to remove the use of StartTLS messages that\n   request the use\
    \ of TLS as it pass on the wire in clear and could also\n   attempt to inject\
    \ a PCErr message that suggests attempting PCEP\n   connection without TLS.\n\
    \   The guidance given in [RFC7525] SHOULD be followed to avoid attacks\n   on\
    \ TLS.\n"

    \   support general TLS configuration as per [RFC5246].  At least the\n   configuration\
    \ of one of the trust models and its corresponding\n   parameters, as described\
    \ in Sections 3.4 and 3.5, MUST be supported\n   by the implementation.\n   A\

    \   PCEPS implementations MAY provide an option to allow the operator to\n   manually\
    \ override strict TLS configuration and allow unsecure\n   connections.  Execution\
    \ of this override SHOULD trigger a warning\n   about the security implications\
    \ of permitting unsecure connections.\n   Further, the operator needs to develop\
    \ suitable security policies\n   around PCEP within his network.  The PCEP peers\
    \ SHOULD provide ways\n   for the operator to complete the following tasks in\
    \ regards to a PCEP\n   session:\n   o  Determine if a session is protected via\
    \ PCEPS.\n   o  Determine the version of TLS, the mechanism used for\n      authentication,\
