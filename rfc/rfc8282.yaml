  - "Abstract\n   The Path Computation Element (PCE) provides path computation\n \
    \  functions in support of traffic engineering in Multiprotocol Label\n   Switching\

    \  PCE is a\n   candidate solution for such requirements.\n   The PCE Communication\

  - "1.  Introduction\n   The Path Computation Element (PCE) defined in [RFC4655]\
    \ is an entity\n   that is capable of computing a network path or route based\
    \ on a\n   network graph and applying computational constraints.  A Path\n   Computation\
    \ Client (PCC) may make requests to a PCE for paths to be\n   computed, and a\
    \ PCE may initiate or modify services in a network by\n   supplying new paths\
    \ [RFC8231] [RFC8281].\n   A network may comprise multiple layers.  These layers\
    \ may represent\n   separation of technologies (e.g., packet switch capable (PSC),\
    \ time\n   division multiplex (TDM), and lambda switch capable (LSC)) [RFC3945];\n\
    \   separation of data-plane switching granularity levels (e.g., Virtual\n   Circuit\
    \ 4 (VC4) and VC12) [RFC5212]; or a distinction between client\n   and server\
    \ networking roles (e.g., commercial or administrative\n   separation of client\
    \ and server networks).  In this multi-layer\n   network, Label Switched Paths\
    \ (LSPs) in lower layers are used to\n   carry higher-layer LSPs.  The network\
    \ topology formed by lower-layer\n   LSPs and advertised as traffic engineering\
    \ links (TE links) in the\n   higher layer is called a Virtual Network Topology\
    \ (VNT) [RFC5212].\n   Discussion of other ways that network layering can be supported\
    \ such\n   that connectivity in a higher-layer network can be provided by LSPs\n\
    \   in a lower-layer network is provided in [RFC7926].\n   It is important to\
    \ optimize network resource utilization globally,\n   i.e., taking into account\
    \ all layers, rather than optimizing resource\n   utilization at each layer independently.\
    \  This allows better network\n   efficiency to be achieved.  This is what we\
    \ call inter-layer traffic\n   engineering.  This includes mechanisms allowing\
    \ the computation of\n   end-to-end paths across layers (known as inter-layer\
    \ path\n   computation) and mechanisms for control and management of the VNT by\n\
    \   setting up and releasing LSPs in the lower layers [RFC5212].\n   PCE can provide\
    \ a suitable mechanism for resolving inter-layer path\n   computation issues.\
    \  The framework for applying the PCE-based path\n   computation architecture\
    \ to inter-layer traffic engineering is\n   described in [RFC5623].\n   The PCE\
    \ communication protocol (PCEP) is designed as a communication\n   protocol between\
    \ PCCs and PCEs and is defined in [RFC5440].  A set of\n   requirements for PCEP\
    \ extensions to support inter-layer traffic\n   engineering is described in [RFC6457].\n\
    \   This document presents PCEP extensions for inter-layer traffic\n   engineering\
    \ that satisfy the requirements described in [RFC6457].\n"

- title: 2.  Overview of PCE-Based Inter-Layer Path Computation
  contents:
  - "2.  Overview of PCE-Based Inter-Layer Path Computation\n   [RFC4206] defines\
    \ a way to signal a higher-layer LSP, which has an\n   explicit route that includes\
    \ hops traversed by LSPs in lower layers.\n   The computation of end-to-end paths\
    \ across layers is called inter-\n   layer path computation.\n   A Label Switching\
    \ Router (LSR) in the higher layer might not have\n   information on the lower-layer\
    \ topology, particularly in an overlay\n   or augmented model [RFC3945]; hence,\
    \ it may not be able to compute an\n   end-to-end path across layers.\n   PCE-based\
    \ inter-layer path computation consists of using one or more\n   PCEs to compute\
    \ an end-to-end path across layers.  This could be\n   achieved by relying on\
    \ a single PCE that has topology information\n   about multiple layers and can\
    \ directly compute an end-to-end path\n   across layers considering the topology\
    \ of all of the layers.\n   Alternatively, the inter-layer path computation could\
    \ be performed\n   using multiple cooperating PCEs where each PCE has information\
    \ about\n   the topology of one or more layers (but not all layers) and where\
    \ the\n   PCEs collaborate to compute an end-to-end path.\n   As described in\
    \ [RFC5339], a hybrid node may advertise a single TE\n   link with multiple switching\
    \ capabilities.  Normally, those TE links\n   exist at the layer/region boarder.\
    \  In this case, a PCE needs to be\n   capable of specifying the server-layer\
    \ path information when the\n   server-layer path information is required to be\
    \ returned to the PCC.\n   [RFC5623] describes models for inter-layer path computation\
    \ in more\n   detail.  It introduces the Virtual Network Topology Manager (VNTM),\
    \ a\n   functional element that controls the VNT, and sets out three distinct\n\
    \   models (and a fourth hybrid model) for inter-layer control involving\n   a\
    \ PCE, triggered signaling, and a Network Management System (NMS).\n"

  contents:
  - "3.  Protocol Extensions\n   This section describes PCEP extensions for inter-layer\
    \ path\n   computation.  Four new objects are defined: the INTER-LAYER object,\n\
    \   the SWITCH-LAYER object, the REQ-ADAP-CAP object, and the SERVER-\n   INDICATION\
    \ object.  Also, two new metric types are defined.\n"
- title: 3.1.  INTER-LAYER Object
  contents:
  - "3.1.  INTER-LAYER Object\n   The INTER-LAYER object is optional and can be used\
    \ in Path\n   Computation Request (PCReq) and Path Computation Reply (PCRep)\n\
    \   messages, and also in Path Computation State Report (PCRpt), Path\n   Computation\
    \ Update Request (PCUpd), and Path Computation LSP Initiate\n   Request (PCInitiate)\
    \ messages.\n   In a PCReq message, the INTER-LAYER object indicates whether inter-\n\
    \   layer path computation is allowed, the type of path to be computed,\n   and\
    \ whether triggered signaling (hierarchical LSPs per [RFC4206] or\n   stitched\
    \ LSPs per [RFC5150] depending on physical network\n   technologies) is allowed.\
    \  When the INTER-LAYER object is absent from\n   a PCReq message, the receiving\
    \ PCE MUST process as though inter-layer\n   path computation had been explicitly\
    \ disallowed (I-bit set to zero --\n   see below).\n   In a PCRep message, the\
    \ INTER-LAYER object indicates whether\n   inter-layer path computation has been\
    \ performed, the type of path\n   that has been computed, and whether triggered\
    \ signaling is used.\n   When a PCReq message includes more than one request,\
    \ an INTER-LAYER\n   object is used per request.  When a PCRep message includes\
    \ more than\n   one path per request that is responded to, an INTER-LAYER object\
    \ is\n   used per path.\n   The applicability of this object to PCRpt and PCUpd\
    \ messages is the\n   same as for other objects on those messages as described\
    \ in\n   [RFC8231].  The applicability of this object to the PCInitiate\n   message\

    \ is used by a PCC in a PCReq message to\n   indicate to a PCE whether an inter-layer\
    \ path is allowed.  When the I\n   flag is set (one), the PCE MAY perform inter-layer\
    \ path computation\n   and return an inter-layer path.  When the flag is clear\
    \ (zero), the\n   path that is returned MUST NOT be an inter-layer path.\n   The\
    \ I flag is used by a PCE in a PCRep message to indicate to a PCC\n   whether\
    \ the path returned is an inter-layer path.  When the I flag is\n   set (one),\
    \ the path is an inter-layer path.  When it is clear (zero),\n   the path is contained\
    \ within a single layer because either inter-\n   layer path computation was not\
    \ performed or a mono-layer path\n   (without any virtual TE link and without\
    \ any loose hop that spans the\n   lower-layer network) was found notwithstanding\
    \ the use of inter-layer\n   path computation.\n   M flag (1 bit): The M flag\
    \ is used by a PCC in a PCReq message to\n   indicate to a PCE whether a mono-layer\
    \ path or multi-layer path is\n   requested.  When the M flag is set (one), a\
    \ multi-layer path is\n   requested.  When it is clear (zero), a mono-layer path\
    \ is requested.\n   The M flag is used by a PCE in a PCRep message to indicate\
    \ to a PCC\n   whether a mono-layer path or multi-layer path is returned.  When\
    \ the\n   M flag is set (one), a multi-layer path is returned.  When the M flag\n\
    \   is clear (zero), a mono-layer path is returned.\n   If the I flag is clear\
    \ (zero), the M flag has no meaning and MUST be\n   ignored.\n   [RFC6457] describes\
    \ two sub-options for mono-layer path.\n   o  A mono-layer path that is specified\
    \ by strict hops.  The path may\n      include virtual TE links.\n   o  A mono-layer\
    \ path that includes loose hops that span the lower-\n      layer network.\n \
    \  The choice of this sub-option can be specified by the use of the O\n   flag\
    \ in the Request Parameter (RP) object specified in [RFC5440].\n   T flag (1 bit):\
    \ The T flag is used by a PCC in a PCReq message to\n   indicate to a PCE whether\
    \ triggered signaling is allowed.  When the T\n   flag is set (one), triggered\
    \ signaling is allowed.  When it is clear\n   (zero), triggered signaling is not\
    \ allowed.\n   The T flag is used by a PCE in a PCRep message to indicate to a\
    \ PCC\n   whether triggered signaling is required to support the returned path.\n\
    \   When the T flag is set (one), triggered signaling is required.  When\n   it\
    \ is clear (zero), triggered signaling is not required.\n   Note that triggered\
    \ signaling is used to support hierarchical\n   [RFC4206] or stitched [RFC5150]\
    \ LSPs according to the physical\n   attributes of the network layers.\n   If\
    \ the I flag is clear (zero), the T flag has no meaning and MUST be\n   ignored.\n\
    \   Note that the I and M flags differ in the following ways.  When the I\n  \
    \ flag is clear (zero), virtual TE links must not be used in path\n   computation.\
    \  In addition, loose hops that span the lower-layer\n   network must not be specified.\
    \  Only regular TE links from the same\n   layer may be used.\n   o  When the\
    \ I flag is set (one), the M flag is clear (zero), and the\n      T flag is set\
    \ (one), virtual TE links are allowed in path\n      computation.  In addition,\
    \ when the O flag of the RP object is\n      set, loose hops that span the lower-layer\
    \ network may be\n      specified.  This will initiate lower-layer LSP setup;\
    \ thus, the\n      inter-layer path is set up even though the path computation\
    \ result\n      from a PCE to a PCC includes hops from the same layer only.\n\
    \   o  However, when the I flag is set (one), the M flag is clear (zero),\n  \
    \    and the T flag is clear (zero), since triggered signaling is not\n      allowed,\
    \ virtual TE links that have not been pre-signaled MUST NOT\n      be used in\
    \ path computation.  In addition, loose hops that span\n      the lower-layer\
    \ network MUST NOT be specified.  Therefore, this is\n      equivalent to the\
    \ I flag being clear (zero).\n   Reserved bits of the INTER-LAYER object sent\
    \ between a PCC and PCE in\n   the same domain MUST be transmitted as zero and\
    \ SHOULD be ignored on\n   receipt.  A PCE that forwards a path computation request\
    \ to other\n   PCEs MUST preserve the settings of reserved bits in the PCReq\n\
    \   messages it sends and in the PCRep messages it forwards to PCCs.\n   Note\
    \ that the flags in the PCRpt message indicate the state of an\n   LSP, whereas\
    \ the flags in the PCUpd and the PCInitiate messages\n   indicate the intended/desired\

  contents:
  - "4.1.  Path Computation Request\n   A PCC requests or allows inter-layer path\
    \ computation in a PCReq\n   message by including the INTER-LAYER object with\
    \ the I flag set.  The\n   INTER-LAYER object indicates whether inter-layer path\
    \ computation is\n   allowed, which path type is requested, and whether triggered\n\
    \   signaling is allowed.\n   The SWITCH-LAYER object, which MUST NOT be present\
    \ unless the INTER-\n   LAYER object is also present, is optionally used to specify\
    \ the\n   switching types and encoding types that define layers that must, or\n\
    \   must not, be used in the computed path.  When the SWITCH-LAYER object\n  \
    \ is used with the INTER-LAYER object I flag clear (zero), inter-layer\n   path\
    \ computation is not allowed, but constraints specified in the\n   SWITCH-LAYER\
    \ object apply.  Example usage includes path computation\n   in a single-layer\
    \ GMPLS network.\n   The REQ-ADAP-CAP object is optionally used to specify the\
    \ interface\n   switching capability of both ends of the lower-layer LSP.  The\n\
    \   REQ-ADAP-CAP object is used in inter-PCE communication, where the PCE\n  \
    \ that is responsible for computing higher-layer paths makes a request\n   as\
    \ a PCC to a PCE that is responsible for computing lower-layer\n   paths.  Alternatively,\
    \ the REQ-ADAP-CAP object may be used in the\n   NMS-VNTM model, where the VNTM\
    \ makes a request as a PCC to a PCE that\n   is responsible for computing lower-layer\
    \ paths.\n   The METRIC object is optionally used to specify metric types to be\n\
    \   optimized or bounded.  When metric type 18 is used, it indicates that\n  \
    \ path computation MUST minimize or bound the number of adaptations on\n   a path.\
    \  When metric type 19 is used, it indicates that path\n   computation MUST minimize\
    \ or bound the number of layers to be\n   involved on a path.\n   Furthermore,\
    \ in order to allow different Objective Functions (OFs) to\n   be applied within\
    \ different network layers, multiple OF objects\n   [RFC5541] MAY be present.\
    \  In such a case, the first OF object\n   specifies an objective function for\
    \ the higher-layer network, and\n   subsequent OF objects specify objection functions\
    \ of the subsequent\n   lower-layer networks.\n"

  - "4.2.  Path Computation Reply\n   In the case of successful path computation,\

    \  When the\n   INTER-LAYER object is included in a PCRep message, the I, M, and\
    \ T\n   flags indicate semantics of the path as described in Section 3.1.\n  \
    \ Furthermore, when the C flag of the METRIC object in a PCReq is set,\n   the\
    \ METRIC object MUST be included in the PCRep to provide the\n   computed metric\
    \ value, as specified in [RFC5440].\n   The PCE MAY specify the server-layer path\
    \ information in the ERO.  In\n   this case, the requested PCE replies with a\
    \ PCRep message that\n   includes at least two sets of ERO information in the\
    \ path-list: one\n   is for the client-layer path information, and another one\
    \ is the\n   server-layer path information.  When SERVER-INDICATION is included\
    \ in\n   a PCRep message, it indicates that the path in the ERO is the server-\n\
    \   layer path information.  The server-layer path specified in the ERO\n   could\
    \ be loose or strict.  On receiving the replied path, the PCC\n   (e.g., NMS and\
    \ ingress node) can trigger the signaling to set up the\n   LSPs according to\
    \ the computed paths.\n   In the case of unsuccessful path computation, the PCRep\
    \ message also\n   contains a NO-PATH object, and the SWITCH-TYPE object and/or\n\
    \   REQ-ADAP-CAP MAY be used to indicate the set of constraints that\n   could\
    \ not be satisfied.\n"
