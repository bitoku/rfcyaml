- title: 2. Motivation
  contents:
  - "2. Motivation\n   This memo is aimed at network operators and service providers\
    \ who\n   need to understand under what circumstances they should make use of\n\
    \   an AS.  It is expected that the reader is familiar with routing\n   protocols\
    \ and will be someone who configures and operates Internet\n   networks.  Unfortunately,\
    \ there is a great deal of confusion in how\n   ASes should be used today; this\
    \ memo attempts to clear up some of\n   this confusion, as well as acting as a\
    \ simple guide to today's\n   exterior routing.\n"
- title: 3. Definitions
  contents:
  - "3. Definitions\n   This document refers to the term \"prefix\" throughout. In\
    \ the current\n   classless Internet (see [CIDR]), a block of class A, B, or C\
    \ networks\n   may be referred to by merely a prefix and a mask, so long as such\
    \ a\n   block of networks begins and ends on a power-of-two boundary. For\n  \
    \ example, the networks:\n        192.168.0.0/24\n        192.168.1.0/24\n   \
    \     192.168.2.0/24\n        192.168.3.0/24\n   can be simply referred to as:\n\
    \        192.168.0.0/22\n   The term \"prefix\" as it is used here is equivalent\
    \ to \"CIDR block\",\n   and in simple terms may be thought of as a group of one\
    \ or more\n   networks. We use the term \"network\" to mean classful network,\
    \ or \"A,\n   B, C network\".\n   The definition of AS has been unclear and ambiguous\
    \ for some time.\n   [BGP-4] states:\n      The classic definition of an Autonomous\
    \ System is a set of routers\n      under a single technical administration, using\
    \ an interior gateway\n      protocol and common metrics to route packets within\
    \ the AS, and\n      using an exterior gateway protocol to route packets to other\
    \ ASes.\n      Since this classic definition was developed, it has become common\n\
    \      for a single AS to use several interior gateway protocols and\n      sometimes\
    \ several sets of metrics within an AS.  The use of the\n      term Autonomous\
    \ System here stresses the fact that, even when\n      multiple IGPs and metrics\
    \ are used, the administration of an AS\n      appears to other ASes to have a\
    \ single coherent interior routing\n      plan and presents a consistent picture\
    \ of what networks are\n      reachable through it.\n   To rephrase succinctly:\n\
    \      An AS is a connected group of one or more IP prefixes run by one\n    \
    \  or more network operators which has a SINGLE and CLEARLY DEFINED\n      routing\
    \ policy.\n   Routing policy here is defined as how routing decisions are made\
    \ in\n   the Internet today.  It is the exchange of routing information\n   between\
    \ ASes that is subject to routing policies. Consider the case\n   of two ASes,\
    \ X and Y exchanging routing information:\n                NET1 ......  ASX  <--->\
    \  ASY  ....... NET2\n   ASX knows how to reach a prefix called NET1.  It does\
    \ not matter\n   whether NET1 belongs to ASX or to some other AS which exchanges\n\
    \   routing information with ASX, either directly or indirectly; we just\n   assume\
    \ that ASX knows how to direct packets towards NET1.  Likewise\n   ASY knows how\
    \ to reach NET2.\n   In order for traffic from NET2 to NET1 to flow between ASX\
    \ and ASY,\n   ASX has to announce NET1 to ASY using an exterior routing protocol;\n\
    \   this means that ASX is willing to accept traffic directed to NET1\n   from\
    \ ASY. Policy comes into play when ASX decides to announce NET1 to\n   ASY.\n\
    \   For traffic to flow, ASY has to accept this routing information and\n   use\
    \ it.  It is ASY's privilege to either use or disregard the\n   information that\
    \ it receives from ASX about NET1's reachability. ASY\n   might decide not to\
    \ use this information if it does not want to send\n   traffic to NET1 at all\
    \ or if it considers another route more\n   appropriate to reach NET1.\n   In\
    \ order for traffic in the direction of NET1 to flow between ASX and\n   ASY,\
    \ ASX must announce that route to ASY and ASY must accept it from\n   ASX:\n \
    \                   resulting packet flow towards NET1\n                  <<===================================\n\
    \                                    |\n                                    |\n\
    \                     announce NET1  |  accept NET1\n                    -------------->\
    \ + ------------->\n                                    |\n                  \
    \      AS X        |    AS Y\n                                    |\n        \
    \             <------------- + <--------------\n                       accept\
    \ NET2  |  announce NET2\n                                    |\n            \
    \                        |\n                   resulting packet flow towards NET2\n\
    \                   ===================================>>\n   Ideally, though\
    \ seldom practically, the announcement and acceptance\n   policies of ASX and\
    \ ASY are symmetrical.\n   In order for traffic towards NET2 to flow, announcement\
    \ and\n   acceptance of NET2 must be in place (mirror image of NET1). For\n  \
    \ almost all applications connectivity in just one direction is not\n   useful\
    \ at all.\n   It should be noted that, in more complex topologies than this\n\
    \   example, traffic from NET1 to NET2 may not necessarily take the same\n   path\
    \ as traffic from NET2 to NET1; this is called asymmetrical\n   routing.  Asymmetrical\
    \ routing is not inherently bad, but can often\n   cause performance problems\
    \ for higher level protocols, such as TCP,\n   and should be used with caution\
    \ and only when necessary. However,\n   assymetric routing may be a requirement\
    \ for mobile hosts and\n   inherently asymmetric siutation, such a satelite download\
    \ and a modem\n   upload connection.\n   Policies are not configured for each\
    \ prefix separately but for groups\n   of prefixes.  These groups of prefixes\
    \ are ASes.\n   An AS has a globally unique number (sometimes referred to as an\
    \ ASN,\n   or Autonomous System Number) associated with it; this number is used\n\
    \   in both the exchange of exterior routing information (between\n   neighboring\
    \ ASes), and as an identifier of the AS itself.\n   In routing terms, an AS will\
    \ normally use one or more interior\n   gateway protocols (IGPs) when exchanging\
    \ reachability information\n   within its own AS. See \"IGP Issues\".\n"
- title: 4. Common errors in allocating ASes
  contents:
  - "4. Common errors in allocating ASes\n   The term AS is often confused or even\
    \ misused as a convenient way of\n   grouping together a set of prefixes which\
    \ belong under the same\n   administrative umbrella, even if within that group\
    \ of prefixes there\n   are various different routing policies. Without exception,\
    \ an AS must\n   have only one routing policy.\n   It is essential that careful\
    \ consideration and coordination be\n   applied during the creation of an AS.\
    \ Using an AS merely for the sake\n   of having an AS is to be avoided, as is\
    \ the worst-case scenario of\n   one AS per classful network (the IDEAL situation\
    \ is to have one\n   prefix, containing many longer prefixes, per AS). This may\
    \ mean that\n   some re-engineering may be required in order to apply the criteria\n\
    \   and guidelines for creation and allocation of an AS that we list\n   below;\
    \ nevertheless, doing so is probably the only way to implement\n   the desired\
    \ routing policy.\n   If you are currently engineering an AS, careful thought\
    \ should be\n   taken to register appropriately sized CIDR blocks with your\n\
    \   registration authority in order to minimize the number of advertised\n   prefixes\
    \ from your AS.  In the perfect world that number can, and\n   should, be as low\
    \ as one.\n   Some router implementations use an AS number as a form of tagging\
    \ to\n   identify interior as well as exterior routing processes.  This tag\n\
    \   does not need to be unique unless routing information is indeed\n   exchanged\
    \ with other ASes. See \"IGP Issues\".\n"
- title: 5. Criteria for the decision -- do I need an AS?
  contents:
  - "5. Criteria for the decision -- do I need an AS?\n   *    Exchange of external\
    \ routing information\n        An AS must be used for exchanging external routing\
    \ information\n        with other ASes through an exterior routing protocol. The\
    \ cur-\n        rent recommended exterior routing protocol is BGP, the Border\n\
    \        Gateway Protocol. However, the exchange of external routing\n       \
    \ information alone does not constitute the need for an AS. See\n        \"Sample\
    \ Cases\" below.\n   *    Many prefixes, one AS\n        As a general rule, one\
    \ should try to place as many prefixes as\n        possible within a given AS,\
    \ provided all of them conform to the\n        same routing policy.\n   *    Unique\
    \ routing policy\n        An AS is only needed when you have a routing policy\
    \ which is\n        different from that of your border gateway peers. Here routing\n\
    \        policy refers to how the rest of the Internet makes routing\n       \
    \ decisions based on information from your AS. See \"Sample\n        Cases\" below\
    \ to see exactly when this criteria will apply.\n"
- title: 5.1 Sample Cases
  contents:
  - "5.1 Sample Cases\n   *    Single-homed site, single prefix\n        A separate\
    \ AS is not needed; the prefix should be placed in an\n        AS of the provider.\
    \ The site's prefix has exactly the same rout-\n        ing policy as the other\
    \ customers of the site's service\n        provider, and there is no need to make\
    \ any distinction in rout-\n        ing information.\n        This idea may at\
    \ first seem slightly alien to some, but it high-\n        lights the clear distinction\
    \ in the use of the AS number as a\n        representation of routing policy as\
    \ opposed to some form of\n        administrative use.\n        In some situations,\
    \ a single site, or piece of a site, may find\n        it necessary to have a\
    \ policy different from that of its\n        provider, or the rest of the site.\
    \ In such an instance, a sepa-\n        rate AS must be created for the affected\
    \ prefixes. This situa-\n        tion is rare and should almost never happen.\
    \ Very few stub sites\n        require different routing policies than their parents.\
    \ Because\n        the AS is the unit of policy, however, this sometimes occurs.\n\
    \   *    Single-homed site, multiple prefixes\n        Again, a separate AS is\
    \ not needed; the prefixes should be\n        placed in an AS of the site's provider.\n\
    \   *    Multi-homed site\n        Here multi-homed is taken to mean a prefix\
    \ or group of prefixes\n        which connects to more than one service provider\
    \ (i.e. more than\n        one AS with its own routing policy). It does not mean\
    \ a network\n        multi-homed running an IGP for the purposes of resilience.\n\
    \        An AS is required; the site's prefixes should be part of a\n        single\
    \ AS, distinct from the ASes of its service providers.\n        This allows the\
    \ customer the ability to have a different repre-\n        sentation of policy\
    \ and preference among the different service\n        providers.\n        This\
    \ is ALMOST THE ONLY case where a network operator should\n        create its\
    \ own AS number. In this case, the site should ensure\n        that it has the\
    \ necessary facilities to run appropriate routing\n        protocols, such as\
    \ BGP4.\n"
- title: 5.2 Other factors
  contents:
  - "5.2 Other factors\n   *    Topology\n        Routing policy decisions such as\
    \ geography, AUP (Acceptable Use\n        Policy) compliance and network topology\
    \ can influence decisions\n        of AS creation. However, all too often these\
    \ are done without\n        consideration of whether or not an AS is needed in\
    \ terms of\n        adding additional information for routing policy decisions\
    \ by\n        the rest of the Internet. Careful consideration should be taken\n\
    \        when basing AS creation on these type of criteria.\n   *    Transition\
    \ / \"future-proofing\"\n        Often a site will be connected to a single service\
    \ provider but\n        has plans to connect to another at some point in the future.\n\
    \        This is not enough of a reason to create an AS before you really\n  \
    \      need it.  The AS number space is finite and the limited amount\n      \
    \  of re-engineering needed when you connect to another service\n        provider\

    \     AS number application forms have historically made no reference\n      \
    \  to routing policy. All too often ASes have been created purely\n        because\

    \ The document should be used as a reference from\n        future application\
    \ forms to show clearly when an AS is needed.\n"
- title: 6. Speculation
  contents:
  - "6. Speculation\n   1) If provider A and provider B have a large presence in a\n\
    \   geographical area (or other routing domain), and many customers are\n   multi-homed\
    \ between them, it makes sense for all of those customers\n   to be placed within\
    \ the same AS. However, it is noted that case\n   should only be looked at if\
    \ practical to do so and fully coordinated\n   between customers and service providers\
    \ involved.\n   2) Sites should not be forced to place themselves in a separate\
    \ AS\n   just so that someone else (externally) can make AS-based policy\n   decisions.\
    \ Nevertheless, it may occasionally be necessary to split\n   up an AS or a prefix\
    \ into two ASes for policy reasons. Those making\n   external policy may request\
    \ the network operators make such AS\n   changes, but the final decision is up\
    \ to those network operators\n   who manage the prefixes in question, as well\
    \ as the ASes containing\n   them. This is, of course, a trade off -- it will\
    \ not always be\n   possible to implement all desired routing policies.\n"
- title: 7. One prefix, one origin AS
  contents:
  - "7. One prefix, one origin AS\n   Generally, a prefix can should belong to only\
    \ one AS. This is a\n   direct consequence of the fact that at each point in the\
    \ Internet\n   there can be exactly one routing policy for traffic destined to\
    \ each\n   prefix. In the case of an prefix which is used in neighbor peering\n\
    \   between two ASes, a conscious decision should be made as to which AS\n   this\
    \ prefix actually resides in.\n   With the introduction of aggregation it should\
    \ be noted that a prefix\n   may be represented as residing in more than one AS,\
    \ however, this is\n   very much the exception rather than the rule. This happens\
    \ when\n   aggregating using the AS_SET attribute in BGP, wherein the concept\
    \ of\n   origin is lost. In some cases the origin AS is lost altogether if\n \
    \  there is a less specific aggregate announcement setting the\n   ATOMIC_AGGREGATE\
    \ attribute.\n"
- title: 8. IGP Issues
  contents:
  - "8. IGP Issues\n   As stated above, many router vendors require an identifier\
    \ for\n   tagging their IGP processes. However, this tag does not need to be\n\
    \   globally unique. In practice this information is never seen by\n   exterior\
    \ routing protocols. If already running an exterior routing\n   protocol, it is\
    \ perfectly reasonable to use your AS number as an IGP\n   tag; if you do not,\
    \ choosing from the private use range is also\n   acceptable (see \"Reserved AS\
    \ Numbers\"). Merely running an IGP is not\n   grounds for registration of an\
    \ AS number.\n   With the advent of BGP4 it becomes necessary to use an IGP that\
    \ can\n   carry classless routes. Examples include OSPF [OSPF] and ISIS [ISIS].\n"
- title: 9. AS Space exhaustion
  contents:
  - "9. AS Space exhaustion\n   The AS number space is a finite amount of address\
    \ space. It is\n   currently defined as a 16 bit integer and hence limited to\
    \ 65535\n   unique AS numbers. At the time of writing some 5,100 ASes have been\n\
    \   allocated and a little under 600 ASes are actively routed in the\n   global\
    \ Internet. It is clear that this growth needs to be continually\n   monitored.\
    \ However, if the criteria applied above are adhered to,\n   then there is no\
    \ immediate danger of AS space exhaustion. It is\n   expected that IDRP will be\
    \ deployed before this becomes an issue.\n   IDRP does not have a fixed limit\
    \ on the size of an RDI.\n"
