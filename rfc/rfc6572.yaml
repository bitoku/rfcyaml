  - "Abstract\n   This document defines new attributes to facilitate Proxy Mobile
    IPv6\n   operations using the RADIUS infrastructure.  The protocol defined in\n
    \  this document uses RADIUS-based interfaces of the mobile access\n   gateway
    and the local mobility anchor with the AAA server for\n   authentication, authorization,
    and policy functions.  The RADIUS\n   interactions between the mobile access gateway
    and the RADIUS-based\n   AAA server take place when the mobile node (MN) attaches,\n
    \  authenticates, and authorizes to a Proxy Mobile IPv6 domain.\n   Furthermore,
    this document defines the RADIUS-based interface between\n   the local mobility
    anchor and the AAA RADIUS server for authorizing\n   received Proxy Binding Update
    messages for the mobile node's mobility\n   session.  In addition to the interactions
    related to mobility session\n   setup, this document defines the baseline for
    the mobile access\n   gateway and the local mobility anchor generated accounting.\n"

  - "1.  Introduction\n   Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) [RFC5213] is a network-based
    mobility\n   management protocol that allows IP mobility support for a mobile
    node\n   without requiring the mobile node's participation in any mobility-\n
    \  related signaling.  The mobile management elements in the network,\n   the
    mobile access gateway (MAG) and the local mobility anchor (LMA),\n   are the two
    key functions in this network-based mobility system.  The\n   mobile access gateway
    is responsible for detecting the mobile node's\n   movements in the network and
    for initiating the needed mobility\n   management signaling with the local mobility
    anchor (LMA).  Both the\n   mobility management agents make use of the AAA infrastructure
    to\n   retrieve the mobile node's policy profile and for performing service\n
    \  authorization.\n   This document defines a RADIUS-based [RFC2865] profile and\n
    \  corresponding attributes to be used on the AAA interface between the\n   MAG
    and the AAA RADIUS server.  This interface is used to carry the\n   per-MN policy
    profile from the remote policy store to the MAG.\n   Furthermore, this document
    also defines a RADIUS-based interface\n   between the LMA and the AAA RADIUS server
    for authorization of the\n   received Proxy Mobile IPv6 signaling messages.  The
    AAA procedures\n   defined in this document cover the following two scenarios:\n
    \  o  a mobile node connects to the Proxy Mobile IPv6 domain from the\n      home
    network\n   o  a mobile node connects to the Proxy Mobile IPv6 domain from a\n
    \     visited network\n"

    \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\"
    in this\n   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].\n   All
    the mobility-related terms used in this document are to be\n   interpreted as
    defined in the Proxy Mobile IPv6 specifications\n   [RFC5213] and [RFC5844].  Additionally,
    this document uses the\n   following abbreviations:\n   Network Access Server
    (NAS):\n      A function that provides authorization services for a device/user\n
    \     access to the network as defined in [RFC2865].  This document\n      makes
    an assumption that the NAS function is co-located with the\n      MAG.  In scenarios
    where the NAS function and MAG are decoupled,\n      the messaging interface needed
    between them for the operation of\n      PMIP6 is beyond the scope of this document.\n
    \  Home AAA (HAAA):\n      An Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA)
    server\n      located in the MN's home network.  This sever has access to the\n
    \     mobile node's policy profiles.\n   Visited AAA (VAAA):\n      An Authentication,
    Authorization, and Accounting (AAA) server\n      located in the MN's visited
    network.  The VAAA server takes the\n      role of a proxy-server, forwarding
    the received AAA service\n      request to the HAAA server in the mobile node's
    home network and\n      relaying the response to the requesting node, after applying
    any\n      local access network policies.\n   Local AAA (LAAA):\n      An Authentication,
    Authorization, and Accounting proxy located in\n      the local network.  In a
    roaming case, the local AAAA has the\n      visited AAA role.\n"

  - "3.  Solution Overview\n   This document defines the RADIUS-based AAA interactions
    with the two\n   mobility management elements in the Proxy Mobile IPv6 domain.\n
    \  o  Interactions between a MAG and a RADIUS-based AAA server\n   o  Interactions
    between a LMA and a RADIUS-based AAA server\n   The mobile node's policy profile
    [RFC5213] is present in a policy\n   store and is needed by the PMIPv6 mobility
    management elements for\n   authorizing the mobile node for mobility management
    service and for\n   obtaining various service-related parameters.  This policy
    store\n   could be locally co-located with the mobility management agents\n   enabling
    direct local access or could be available from a AAA server\n   through a RADIUS-based
    AAA interface.\n   When a mobile node attaches to an access network, the NAS on
    that\n   access network may activate the network access authentication\n   procedure.
    \ The choice of the authentication mechanism is specific to\n   the access network
    deployment; however, it is typically based on the\n   Extensible Authentication
    Protocol (EAP) [RFC3748].  The NAS performs\n   the network access authentication
    and queries the HAAA using AAA\n   protocol, such as RADIUS.  If the network access
    authentication\n   succeeds, the MN's policy profile is obtained as part of the
    RADIUS\n   message exchange with the AAA server.\n   The mobile node may be an
    IPv4-only node, IPv6-only node, or a dual-\n   stack (IPv4/v6) node.  Based on
    the policy specified in the policy\n   profile, the network access authentication
    procedure SHOULD provide\n   the unambiguous indication of the type of address(es)
    to be assigned\n   for the MN in the network and with all other service-related
    and\n   policy parameters relevant to the mobility service.\n   After the successful
    network access authentication and obtaining the\n   mobile node's policy profile,
    the MAG sends a Proxy Binding Update\n   (PBU) to the LMA.  Upon receiving the
    PBU, the LMA interacts with the\n   HAAA to obtain the mobile node's policy profile,
    which is required\n   for authorizing and activating mobility service.\n   This
    document adds support for three distinct PMIPv6 mobility use\n   cases, taking
    into account the administrative domains to which the\n   MAG and the LMA belong.
    \ The following are the three relevant\n   deployment models.\n   1.  the MAG
    and LMA are both in the home network,\n   2.  the MAG and LMA are both in the
    visited network,\n   3.  the MAG is in the visited network while the LMA is in
    the home\n       network.\n   Figure 1 shows participating network entities for
    the PMIPv6 mobility\n   session, which is located in the home network.  The MAG
    and LMA\n   interact only with the HAAA.\n       +--------+\n       | HAAA & |

    - "4.1.  MIP6-Feature-Vector\n   Diameter [RFC3588] reserves AVP Code space 1-255
      as RADIUS attribute\n   compatibility space.  The MIP6-Feature-Vector attribute
      (Type value\n   124) defined in [RFC5447] is of type OctetString and contains
      a\n   64-bit flags field of supported mobility capabilities.  This document\n
      \  reserves two new capability bits according to the rules in [RFC5447],\n   and
      reuses the PMIPv6 capability bits defined by [RFC5779].  The\n   following capability
      flag bits are used or defined in this document:\n   PMIP6_SUPPORTED (0x0000010000000000)\n
      \     This capability bit is used as defined in [RFC5779].\n   IP4_HOA_SUPPORTED
      (0x0000020000000000)\n      This capability bit is used as defined in [RFC5779].
      \ Assignment\n      of the IPv4-HoA (Home Address) is defined by [RFC5844].\n
      \  LOCAL_MAG_ROUTING_SUPPORTED (0x0000040000000000)\n      This capability bit
      is used as defined in [RFC5779].\n   IP4_TRANSPORT_SUPPORTED (0x0000800000000000)\n
      \     This capability bit is used for negotiation of the IPv4 transport\n      support
      between the MAG and AAA.  When the MAG sets this flag bit\n      in the MIP6-Feature-Vector,
      it indicates the ability of the MAG to\n      provide IPv4 transport (i.e.,
      IPv4-based encapsulation) for\n      carrying IP traffic between the MAG and
      the LMA.  If this flag bit\n      is unset in the returned MIP6-Feature-Vector
      attribute, the AAA\n      does not authorize the use of IPv4 transport on the
      MAG-to-LMA\n      tunnel.\n   IP4_HOA_ONLY_SUPPORTED (0x0001000000000000)\n
      \     This capability bit is used for determination of the authorized\n      PMIPv6
      mobility mode.  When this bit is set by the AAA, it\n      indicates PMIPv6
      mobility with IPv4 support has only been\n      authorized for the MN.  As a
      result, the RADIUS Access-Accept\n      SHOULD NOT carry the IPv6 Home Network
      Prefix (IPv6 HNP).  When\n      this bit is set, the PMIP6_SUPPORTED flag MUST
      also be set and the\n      IP4_HOA_SUPPORTED flag MUST NOT be set.\n   To summarize
      the use of the MIP6-Feature-Vector the following\n   capability bit combination
      settings mean:\n      PMIP6-SUPPORTED bit set - only IPv6 mobility is supported
      and\n      authorized.\n      PMIP6-SUPPORTED and IP4-ONLY-HOA-SUPPORTED bits
      set - only IPv4\n      mobility is supported and authorized.\n      PMIP6-SUPPORTED
      and IP4-HOA-SUPPORTED bits set - both IPv6 and\n      IPv4 mobility are supported
      and authorized.\n   The MIP6-Feature-Vector attribute is also used on the LMA
      to the\n   RADIUS AAA interface.  This capability announcement attribute enables\n
      \  direct capability negotiation between the LMA and the AAA.  The\n   capabilities
      that are announced by both parties in the MIP6-Feature-\n   Vector are known
      to be mutually supported.  The LMA may use this\n   mechanism during authorization
      of the received PBU against the AAA to\n   check individual PMIPv6 feature permissions
      for a particular MN.\n   If the RADIUS Access-Accept contains a contradicting
      combination of\n   the capability flag bits such as both the IP4_HOA_ONLY_SUPPORTED
      and\n   the IP4_HOA_SUPPORTED flags being set, then the RADIUS client MUST\n
      \  treat the Access-Accept as an Access-Reject and SHOULD log the event.\n   Similarly,
      if the RADIUS Access-Request contains a contradicting\n   combination of the
      capability flag bits, then the RADIUS server MUST\n   reply with an Access-Reject
      message and SHOULD log the event.\n"

      \  capabilities, the MAG may retrieve different sets of PMIPv6-session-\n   related
      parameters:\n   o  Configuration attributes for home or visited network access\n
      \     scenario, depending on the location and attachment point of the\n      MN,\n

      MN's service\n      Policy,\n   o  The DHCP Relay support attributes (IPv4 or
      IPv6) in case such\n      functionality is supported in the network.\n   In
      addition to PMIPv6-specific attributes, other RADIUS attributes\n   are to be
      used on the MAG-to-AAA interface.\n   The User-Name attribute MUST be present

      SHOULD correspond to an\n   MN identity unless the identity is being suppressed
      for policy\n   reasons, for example, when identity hiding is in effect.  The
      MN\n   identity, if available, MUST be in Network Access Identifier (NAI)\n

    '
  - contents:
    - "6.1.  Interface Operations\n   The LMA-to-HAAA interface may be used for multiple
      purposes.  These\n   include the authorization of the incoming PBU, updating
      the LMA\n   address to the HAAA, delegating the assignment of the MN-HNP or
      the\n   IPv4-HoA to the HAAA, and accounting and PMIPv6 session management.\n
      \  The primary purpose of this interface is to update the HAAA with the\n   LMA
      address information in case of dynamically assigned LMA and to\n   exchange
      the MN address assignment information between the LMA and\n   the HAAA.\n   Whenever
      the LMA sends an Access-Request message to the HAAA, the\n   User-Name attribute
      SHOULD contain the MN's identity.  The LMA-\n   provided identity in the User-Name
      attribute is strongly RECOMMENDED\n   to be the same as the MN's identity information
      in the PBU MN-\n   Identifier mobility option.  The identity SHOULD also be
      the same as\n   used on the MAG-to-HAAA interface; however, in case those identities\n
      \  differ, the HAAA MUST have a mechanism of mapping the MN identity\n   used
      on the MAG-to-HAAA interface to the identity used on the LMA-to-\n   HAAA interface.\n
      \  If the PBU contains the MN Link-Layer Identifier option, the Calling-\n   Station-Id
      attribute SHOULD be included in the request message\n   containing the received
      MN Link-Layer Identifier option.\n   Furthermore, if the PBU contains the Service
      Selection mobility\n   option [RFC5149], the Service-Selection attribute SHOULD
      be included\n   in the request message containing the received service identifier.\n
      \  Both the MN Link-Layer Identifier option and the service selection\n   can
      be used to provide more information for the PBU authorization\n   step in the
      HAAA.\n   The Service-Type attribute MUST be set to the value 17 (Authorize\n
      \  Only).  If the HAAA is not able to authorize the subscriber's\n   mobility
      service session, then the Access-Reject message to the LMA\n   MAY contain the
      Reply-Message attribute describing the reason for\n   rejecting the authorization.
      \ A failed authorization obviously\n   results in a rejection of the PBU, and
      a PBA with an appropriate\n   error Status Value MUST be sent back to the MAG.\n
      \  The authorization step MUST be performed at least for the initial PBU\n   session
      up to a mobility session, when the LMA-to-HAAA interface is\n   deployed.  For
      the subsequent re-registration and handover of PBUs,\n   the authorization step
      MAY be repeated (in this case, the LMA-to-HAAA\n   interface should also maintain
      an authorization session state).\n   In case of a dynamic LMA discovery and
      assignment [RFC6097], the HAAA\n   and the remote policy store may need to be
      updated with the selected\n   LMA address information.  The update can be done
      during the PBU\n   authorization step using the LMA-to-HAAA interface.  This\n
      \  specification uses the PMIP6-*-LMA-*-Address attribute for carrying\n   the
      LMA's address information from the LMA to the HAAA.  The LMA\n   address information
      in the request message MUST contain the IP\n   address of the LMA, the Fully
      Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) uniquely\n   identifying the LMA, or both.  The
      LMA address information refers to\n   the PMIPv6 part of the LMA, not necessarily
      the LMA part interfacing\n   with the AAA infrastructure.\n   The LMA and the
      HAAA use the PMIP6-Home-HN-Prefix/\n   PMIP6-Visited-HN-Prefix attributes to
      exchange the MN-HNP when\n   appropriate.  Similarly, the LMA and the HAAA use
      the PMIP6-Home-\n   IPv4-HoA/PMIP6-Visited-IPv4-HoA attributes to exchange the
      IPv4-MN-\n   HoA when appropriate.  The MN address information exchange is again\n
      \  done during the PBU authorization step.  The HAAA MAY also use the\n   LMA-provided
      MN address information as a part of the information used\n   to authorize the
      PBU.\n   Which entity is actually responsible for the address management is\n
      \  deployment specific within the PMIPv6 Domain and MUST be pre-agreed\n   on
      per deployment basis.  When the LMA is responsible for the address\n   management,
      the PMIP6-*-HN-Prefix/PMIP6-*-IPv4-HoA attributes are\n   used to inform the
      HAAA and the remote policy store of the MN-HNP/\n   IPv4-MN-HoA assigned to
      the MN.  It is also possible that the LMA\n   delegates the address management
      to the HAAA.  In this case, the\n   MN-HNP/IPv4-MN-HoA are set to undefined
      addresses in the Access-\n   Request message sent from the LMA to the HAAA.
      \ The LMA expects to\n   receive the HAAA assigned HNP/IPv4-MN-HoA in the corresponding\n
      \  Access-Accept message.\n"
