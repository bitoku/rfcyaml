  - "Abstract\n   Canonical XML specifies a standard serialization of XML that, when\n\
    \   applied to a subdocument, includes the subdocument's ancestor context\n  \
    \ including all of the namespace declarations and attributes in the\n   \"xml:\"\
    \ namespace.  However, some applications require a method which,\n   to the extent\
    \ practical, excludes ancestor context from a\n   canonicalized subdocument. \
    \ For example, one might require a digital\n   signature over an XML payload (subdocument)\
    \ in an XML message that\n   will not break when that subdocument is removed from\
    \ its original\n   message and/or inserted into a different context.  This requirement\n\
    \   is satisfied by Exclusive XML Canonicalization.\n"

  - "1.  Introduction\n   The XML Recommendation [XML] specifies the syntax of a class\
    \ of\n   objects called XML documents.  The Namespaces in XML Recommendation\n\
    \   [XML-NS] specifies additional syntax and semantics for XML documents.\n  \
    \ It is normal for XML documents and subdocuments which are equivalent\n   for\
    \ the purposes of many applications to differ in their physical\n   representation.\
    \  For example, they may differ in their entity\n   structure, attribute ordering,\
    \ and character encoding.  The goal of\n   this specification is to establish\
    \ a method for serializing the XPath\n   node-set representation of an XML document\
    \ or subset such that:\n      1. The node-set is minimally affected by any XML\
    \ context which has\n         been omitted.\n      2. The canonicalization of\
    \ a node-set representing well-balanced\n         XML [XML-Fragment] will be unaltered\
    \ by further applications of\n         exclusive canonicalization.\n      3. It\
    \ can be determined whether two node-sets are identical except\n         for transformations\
    \ considered insignificant by this\n         specification under [XML, XML-NS].\n\
    \   An understanding of the Canonical XML Recommendation [XML-C14N] is\n   required.\n\
    \   The World Wide Web Consortium Recommendation corresponding to this\n   RFC\
    \ is at: http://www.w3.org/TR/xml-exc-c14n.  Errata are located at\n   http://www.w3.org/2002/07/xml-exc-c14n-errata.\n"
- title: 1.1.  Terminology
  contents:
  - "1.1.  Terminology\n   The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"\
    SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\"\
    , and \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n   document are to be interpreted as described in\
    \ RFC 2119 [Keywords].\n   The XPath 1.0 Recommendation [XPath] defines the term\
    \ node-set and\n   specifies a data model for representing an input XML document\
    \ as a\n   set of nodes of various types (element, attribute, namespace, text,\n\
    \   comment, processing instruction, and root).  The nodes are included\n   in\
    \ or excluded from a node-set based on the evaluation of an\n   expression.  Within\
    \ this specification and [XML-C14N], a node-set is\n   used to directly indicate\
    \ whether or not each node should be rendered\n   in the canonical form (in this\
    \ sense, it is used as a formal\n   mathematical set).  A node that is excluded\
    \ from the set is not\n   rendered in the canonical form being generated, even\
    \ if its parent\n   node is included in the node-set.  However, an omitted node\
    \ may still\n   impact the rendering of its descendants (e.g., by affecting the\n\
    \   namespace context of the descendants).\n   A document subset is a portion\
    \ of an XML document indicated by an\n   XPath node-set that may not include all\
    \ of the nodes in the document.\n   As defined in [XPath] every node (e.g., element,\
    \ attribute, and\n   namespace), has exactly one parent, which is either an element\
    \ node\n   or the root node.  An apex node is an element node in a document\n\
    \   subset having no element node ancestor in the document subset.  An\n   orphan\
    \ node is an element node whose parent element node is not in\n   the document\
    \ subset.  The output parent of an orphan node that is not\n   an apex node is\
    \ the nearest ancestor element of the orphan node that\n   is in the document\
    \ subset; an apex node has no output parent.  The\n   output parent of a non-orphan\
    \ node is the parent of the node.  An\n   output ancestor is any ancestor element\
    \ node in the document subset.\n   For example given a document tree with three\
    \ generations under the\n   root node A and where capitalization denotes the node\
    \ is in the\n   document subset (A,E,G).\n   Pictorial Representation:\n     [diagram\
    \ of nodes,\n      http://www.w3.org/TR/xml-exc-c14n/exc-c14n.png]\n   Textual\
    \ Representation:\n     A-+-b\n       `-c-+-d\n           `-E-+-f\n          \
    \     `-G\n   The following characteristics apply:\n      *  A is an apex node,\
    \ output parent of E, and output ancestor of\n         (E,G);\n      *  E is an\
    \ orphan node and the output parent of G.\n   An element E in a document subset\
    \ visibly utilizes a namespace\n   declaration, i.e., a namespace prefix P and\
    \ bound value V, if E or an\n   attribute node in the document subset with parent\
    \ E has a qualified\n   name in which P is the namespace prefix.  A similar definition\n\
    \   applies for an element E in a document subset that visibly utilizes\n   the\
    \ default namespace declaration, which occurs if E has no namespace\n   prefix.\n\
    \   The namespace axis of an element contains nodes for all non-default\n   namespace\
    \ declarations made within the element as well as non-default\n   namespace declarations\
    \ inherited from ancestors of the element.  The\n   namespace axis also contains\
    \ a node representing the default\n   namespace if it is not the empty string,\
    \ whether the default\n   namespace was declared within the element or by an ancestor\
    \ of the\n   element.  Any subset of the nodes in a namespace axis can be included\n\
    \   in a document subset.\n   The method of canonicalization described in this\
    \ specification\n   receives an InclusiveNamespaces PrefixList parameter, which\
    \ lists\n   namespace prefixes that are handled in the manner described by the\n\
    \   Canonical XML Recommendation [XML-C14N].\n   The exclusive canonical form\
    \ of a document subset is a physical\n   representation of the XPath node-set,\
    \ as an octet sequence, produced\n   by the method described in this specification.\
    \  It is as defined in\n   the Canonical XML Recommendation [XML-C14N] except\
    \ for the changes\n   summarized as follows:\n      *  attributes in the XML namespace,\
    \ such as xml:lang and xml:space\n         are not imported into orphan nodes\
    \ of the document subset, and\n      *  namespace nodes that are not on the InclusiveNamespaces\n\
    \         PrefixList are expressed only in start tags where they are\n       \
    \  visible and if they are not in effect from an output ancestor\n         of\
    \ that tag.\n   The term exclusive canonical XML refers to XML that is in exclusive\n\
    \   canonical form.  The exclusive XML canonicalization method is the\n   algorithm\
    \ defined by this specification that generates the exclusive\n   canonical form\
    \ of a given XML document subset.  The term exclusive\n   XML canonicalization\
    \ refers to the process of applying the exclusive\n   XML canonicalization method\
    \ to an XML document subset.\n"
- title: 1.2.  Applications
  contents:
  - "1.2.  Applications\n   The applications of Exclusive XML Canonicalization are\
    \ very similar\n   to those for Canonical XML [XML-C14N].  However, exclusive\n\
    \   canonicalization, or equivalent means of excluding most XML context,\n   is\
    \ necessary for signature applications where the XML context of\n   signed XML\
    \ will change.  This sort of change is typical of many\n   protocol applications.\n\
    \   Note that in the case of the SignedInfo element of [XML-DSig], the\n   specification\
    \ of an appropriate canonicalization method is the only\n   technique available\
    \ to protect the signature from insignificant\n   changes in physical form and\
    \ changes in XML context.\n"
- title: 1.3.  Limitations
  contents:
  - "1.3.  Limitations\n   Exclusive XML Canonicalization has the limitations of Canonical\
    \ XML\n   [XML-C14N] plus two additional limitations as follows:\n      1. The\
    \ XML being canonicalized may depend on the effect of XML\n         namespace\
    \ attributes, such as xml:lang, xml:space, and xml:base\n         appearing in\
    \ ancestor nodes.  To avoid problems due to the\n         non-importation of such\
    \ attributes into an enveloped document\n         subset, either they MUST be\
    \ explicitly given in a node of the\n         XML document subset being canonicalized\
    \ where their effect is\n         needed or which is an ancestor of the node where\
    \ their effect\n         is needed or they MUST always be declared with an equivalent\n\
    \         value in every context in which the XML document subset will be\n  \
    \       interpreted.\n      2. Applications that use the XML being canonicalized\
    \ may depend on\n         the effect of XML namespace declarations where the namespace\n\
    \         prefix being bound is not visibly utilized.  An example would\n    \
    \     be an attribute whose value is an XPath expression and whose\n         evaluation\
    \ therefore depends upon namespace prefixes referenced\n         in the expression.\
    \  Or, an attribute value might be considered\n         a QName [XML-NS] by some\
    \ applications, but it is only a\n         string-value to XPath:\n         <number\
    \ xsi:type=\"xsd:decimal\">10.09</number>.\n      To avoid problems with such\
    \ namespace declarations,\n      o  the XML MUST be modified so that use of the\
    \ namespace prefix\n         involved is visible, or\n      o  the namespace declarations\
    \ MUST appear and be bound to the same\n         values in every context in which\
    \ the XML will be interpreted,\n         or\n      o  the prefixes for such namespaces\
    \ MUST appear in the\n         InclusiveNamespaces PrefixList.\n"
- title: 2.  The Need for Exclusive XML Canonicalization
  contents:
  - "2.  The Need for Exclusive XML Canonicalization\n   In some cases, particularly\
    \ for signed XML in protocol applications,\n   there is a need to canonicalize\
    \ a subdocument in such a way that it\n   is substantially independent of its\
    \ XML context.  This is because, in\n   protocol applications, it is common to\
    \ envelope XML in various layers\n   of message or transport elements, to strip\
    \ off such enveloping, and\n   to construct new protocol messages, parts of which\
    \ were extracted\n   from different messages previously received.  If the pieces\
    \ of XML in\n   question are signed, they need to be canonicalized in a way such\
    \ that\n   these operations do not break the signature but the signature still\n\
    \   provides as much security as can be practically obtained.\n"
- title: 2.1.  A Simple Example
  contents:
  - "2.1.  A Simple Example\n   As a simple example of the type of problem that changes\
    \ in XML\n   context can cause for signatures, consider the following document:\n\
    \      <n1:elem1 xmlns:n1=\"http://b.example\">\n          content\n      </n1:elem1>\n\
    \   this is then enveloped in another document:\n      <n0:pdu xmlns:n0=\"http://a.example\"\
    >\n         <n1:elem1 xmlns:n1=\"http://b.example\">\n             content\n \
    \        </n1:elem1>\n      </n0:pdu>\n   The first document above is in canonical\
    \ form.  But assume that\n   document is enveloped as in the second case.  The\
    \ subdocument with\n   elem1 as its apex node can be extracted from this second\
    \ case with an\n   XPath expression such as:\n    (//. | //@* | //namespace::*)[ancestor-or-self::n1:elem1]\n\
    \   The result of applying Canonical XML to the resulting XPath node-set\n   is\
    \ the following (except for line wrapping to fit this document):\n      <n1:elem1\
    \ xmlns:n0=\"http://a.example\"\n                xmlns:n1=\"http://b.example\"\
    >\n          content\n      </n1:elem1>\n   Note that the n0 namespace has been\
    \ included by Canonical XML because\n   it includes namespace context.  This change\
    \ which would break a\n   signature over elem1 based on the first version.\n"
- title: 2.2.  General Problems with re-Enveloping
  contents:
  - "2.2.  General Problems with re-Enveloping\n   As a more complete example of the\
    \ changes in canonical form that can\n   occur when the enveloping context of\
    \ a document subset is changed,\n   consider the following document:\n      <n0:local\
    \ xmlns:n0=\"foo:bar\"\n                xmlns:n3=\"ftp://example.org\">\n    \
    \     <n1:elem2 xmlns:n1=\"http://example.net\"\n                   xml:lang=\"\
    en\">\n             <n3:stuff xmlns:n3=\"ftp://example.org\"/>\n         </n1:elem2>\n\
    \      </n0:local>\n   And the following which has been produced by changing the\
    \ enveloping\n   of elem2:\n      <n2:pdu xmlns:n1=\"http://example.com\"\n  \
    \            xmlns:n2=\"http://foo.example\"\n              xml:lang=\"fr\"\n\
    \              xml:space=\"retain\">\n         <n1:elem2 xmlns:n1=\"http://example.net\"\
    \n                   xml:lang=\"en\">\n             <n3:stuff xmlns:n3=\"ftp://example.org\"\
    />\n         </n1:elem2>\n      </n2:pdu>\n   Assume an XPath node-set produced\
    \ from each case by applying the\n   following XPath expression:\n    (//. | //@*\
    \ | //namespace::*)[ancestor-or-self::n1:elem2]\n   Applying Canonical XML to\
    \ the node-set produced from the first\n   document yields the following serialization\
    \ (except for line wrapping\n   to fit in this document):\n      <n1:elem2 xmlns:n0=\"\
    foo:bar\"\n                xmlns:n1=\"http://example.net\"\n                xmlns:n3=\"\
    ftp://example.org\"\n                xml:lang=\"en\">\n          <n3:stuff></n3:stuff>\n\
    \      </n1:elem2>\n   However, although elem2 is represented by the same octet\
    \ sequence in\n   both pieces of external XML above, the Canonical XML version\
    \ of elem2\n   from the second case would be (except for line wrapping so it will\n\
    \   fit into this document) as follows:\n     <n1:elem2 xmlns:n1=\"http://example.net\"\
    \n                xmlns:n2=\"http://foo.example\"\n                xml:lang=\"\
    en\"\n                xml:space=\"retain\">\n          <n3:stuff xmlns:n3=\"ftp://example.org\"\
    ></n3:stuff>\n      </n1:elem2>\n   Note that the change in context has resulted\
    \ in lots of changes in\n   the subdocument as serialized by the inclusive Canonical\
    \ XML [XML-\n   C14N].  In the first example, n0 had been included from the context\n\
    \   and the presence of an identical n3 namespace declaration in the\n   context\
    \ had elevated that declaration to the apex of the\n   canonicalized form.  In\
    \ the second example, n0 has gone away but n2\n   has appeared, n3 is no longer\
    \ elevated, and an xml:space declaration\n   has appeared, due to changes in context.\
    \  But not all context changes\n   have effect.  In the second example, the presence\
    \ at ancestor nodes\n   of an xml:lang and n1 prefix namespace declaration have\
    \ no effect\n   because of existing declarations at the elem2 node.\n   On the\
    \ other hand, using Exclusive XML Canonicalization as specified\n   herein, the\
    \ physical form of elem2 as extracted by the XPath\n   expression above is (except\
    \ for line wrapping so it will fit into\n   this document) as follows:\n     \
    \ <n1:elem2 xmlns:n1=\"http://example.net\"\n                xml:lang=\"en\">\n\
    \          <n3:stuff xmlns:n3=\"ftp://example.org\"></n3:stuff>\n      </n1:elem2>\n\
    \   in both cases.\n"
- title: 3.  Specification of Exclusive XML Canonicalization
  contents:
  - "3.  Specification of Exclusive XML Canonicalization\n   The data model, processing,\
    \ input parameters, and output data for\n   Exclusive XML Canonicalization are\
    \ the same as for Canonical XML\n   [XML-C14N] with the following exceptions:\n\
    \      1. Canonical XML applied to a document subset requires the search\n   \
    \      of the ancestor nodes of each orphan element node for\n         attributes\
    \ in the XML namespace, such as xml:lang and\n         xml:space.  These are copied\
    \ into the element node except if a\n         declaration of the same attribute\
    \ is already in the attribute\n         axis of the element (whether or not it\
    \ is included in the\n         document subset).  This search and copying are\
    \ omitted from the\n         Exclusive XML Canonicalization method.\n      2.\
    \ The Exclusive XML Canonicalization method may receive an\n         additional,\
    \ possibly null, parameter InclusiveNamespaces\n         PrefixList containing\
    \ a list of namespace prefixes and/or a\n         token indicating the presence\
    \ of the default namespace.  All\n         namespace nodes appearing on this list\
    \ are handled as provided\n         in Canonical XML [XML-C14N].\n      3. A namespace\
    \ node N with a prefix that does not appear in the\n         InclusiveNamespaces\
    \ PrefixList is rendered if all of the\n         conditions are met:\n       \
    \  1. Its parent element is in the node-set, and\n         2. it is visibly utilized\
    \ by its parent element, and\n         3. the prefix has not yet been rendered\
    \ by any output ancestor,\n            or the nearest output ancestor of its parent\
    \ element that\n            visibly utilizes the namespace prefix does not have\
    \ a\n            namespace node in the node-set with the same namespace\n    \
    \        prefix and value as N.\n      4. If the token representing the default\
    \ namespace is not present\n         in InclusiveNamespaces PrefixList, then the\
    \ rules for rendering\n         xmlns=\"\" are changed as follows.  When canonicalizing\
    \ the\n         namespace axis of an element E that is in the node-set, output\n\
    \         xmlns=\"\" if and only if all of the conditions are met:\n         1.\
    \ E visibly utilizes the default namespace (i.e., it has no\n            namespace\
    \ prefix), and\n         2. it has no default namespace node in the node-set,\
    \ and\n         3. the nearest output ancestor of E that visibly utilizes the\n\
    \            default namespace has a default namespace node in the node-\n   \
    \         set.  (This step for xmlns=\"\" is necessary because it is not\n   \
    \         represented in the XPath data model as a namespace node, but\n     \
    \       as the absence of a namespace node; see  Section 4.7\n            Propagation\
    \ of Default Namespace Declaration in Document\n            Subsets [XML-C14N].)\n"

    \ Canonical XML except for namespace nodes\n         which are rendered as follows:\n\

    \     been rendered by an output ancestor of the namespace node's\n          \
    \  parent element.\n         2. Render each namespace node if and only if all\

    \ by the immediate parent element or\n               one of its attributes, or\
    \ is present in\n               InclusiveNamespaces PrefixList, and\n        \
    \    2. its prefix and value do not appear in ns_rendered.\n         3. Render\
    \ xmlns=\"\" if and only if all of the conditions are\n            met:\n    \
    \        1. The default namespace is visibly utilized by the\n               immediate\
    \ parent element node, or the default prefix\n               token is present\
    \ in InclusiveNamespaces PrefixList, and\n            2. the element does not\
    \ have a namespace node in the node-\n               set declaring a value for\
    \ the default namespace, and\n            3. the default namespace prefix is present\
    \ in the dictionary\n               ns_rendered.\n         4. Insert all the rendered\
    \ namespace nodes (including xmlns=\"\")\n            into the ns_rendered dictionary,\
    \ replacing any existing\n            entries.  Push ns_rendered onto the state\

- title: 5.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "5.  Security Considerations\n   This specification is used to serialize an XPath\
    \ node-set under\n   certain assumptions given in [XML-C14N] and this specification.\n\
    \   Three such examples include:\n   1. implementations of [XML-C14N] and this\
    \ specification do not render\n      an XML declaration;\n   2. implementations\
    \ of this specification only render attributes from\n      the \"XML\" namespace\
    \ (e.g., xml:lang, xml:space, and xml:base) when\n      they are in the subset\
    \ being serialized;\n   3. implementations of this specification do not consider\
    \ the\n      appearance of a namespace prefix within an attribute value to be\n\
    \      visibly utilized.\n   While such choices are consistent with other XML\
    \ specifications and\n   satisfy the Working Group's application requirements\
    \ it is important\n   that an XML application carefully construct its transforms\
    \ such that\n   the result is meaningful and unambiguous in its application context.\n\
    \   In addition to this section, the Limitations of this specification,\n   the\
    \ Resolutions of [XML-C14N], and the Security Considerations of\n   [XML-DSig]\
    \ should be carefully attended to.\n"
- title: 5.1.  Target Context
  contents:
  - "5.1.  Target Context\n   The requirement of this specification is to satisfy\
    \ applications that\n   \"require a method which, to the extent practical, excludes\
    \ ancestor\n   context from a canonicalized subdocument.\" Given a fragment being\n\
    \   removed from its source instance, this specification satisfies this\n   requirement\
    \ by excluding from the fragment any context from its\n   ancestors that is not\
    \ utilized.  Consequently, a signature [XML-DSig]\n   over that fragment will\
    \ remain valid in its source context, removed\n   from the source context, and\
    \ even in a new target context.  However,\n   this specification does not insulate\
    \ the fragment against confused\n   interpretation in a target context.\n   For\
    \ example, if the <Foo/> element is signed in its source instance\n   of <Bar/><Foo/></Bar>\
    \ and then removed and placed in the target\n   instance <Baz xmlns=\"http://example.org/bar\"\
    /><Foo/></Baz>, the\n   signature should still be valid, but won't be if <Foo/>\
    \ is\n   interpreted as belonging to the http://example.org/bar namespace:\n \
    \  this is dependent on how nodes are processed.\n   This specification does not\
    \ define mechanisms of removing, inserting,\n   and \"fixing up\" a node-set.\
    \ (For an example of this sort of\n   specification, see the processing required\
    \ of Creating the Result\n   Infoset (section 4.5) when an [XInclude] is performed.)\
    \ Instead,\n   applications must carefully specify the XML (i.e., source, fragment,\n\
    \   and target) or define the node-set processing (i.e., removal,\n   replacement,\
    \ and insertion) with respect to default namespace\n   declarations (e.g., xmlns=\"\
    \") and XML attributes (e.g., xml:lang,\n   xml:space, and xml:base).\n"
- title: 5.2.  'Esoteric' Node-sets
  contents:
  - "5.2.  'Esoteric' Node-sets\n   Consider an application that might use this specification\
    \ or [XML-\n   C14N] to serialize a single attribute node.  An implementation\
    \ of\n   either specification will not emit a namespace declaration for that\n\
    \   single attribute node.  Consequently, a \"carefully constructed\"\n   transform\
    \ should create a node-set containing the attribute and the\n   relevant namespace\
    \ declaration for serialization.\n   This example is provided to caution that\
    \ as one moves beyond well-\n   formed [XML] and then well-balanced XML [XML-Fragment],\
    \ it becomes\n   increasingly difficult to create a result that \"is meaningful\
    \ and\n   unambiguous in its application context.\"\n"
