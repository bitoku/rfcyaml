  - "1.  Introduction\n   In some secure environments, email messages can't be released\
    \ to the\n   Message Transfer System (MTS); thus, they can't be delivered to\n\
    \   recipients unless they are authorized by one or more Authorizing\n   Users\
    \ (e.g., Releasing Officers or Release Authorities).  This\n   document describes\
    \ how this mechanism can be realized by an\n   additional Internet Email [RFC5322]\
    \ header field and optionally\n   protected using S/MIME [RFC5750] [RFC5751] or\
    \ DomainKeys Identified\n   Mail (DKIM) [RFC6376].\n   This document describes\
    \ a procedure for how an email message composed\n   by one user can be released\
    \ to the MTS when one or more Authorizing\n   Users authorize and optionally countersign\
    \ the message.  The MMHS-\n   Authorizing-Users header field (see Section 4) communicates\
    \ which\n   user(s) authorized the message.  If S/MIME signed, the resulting\n\
    \   message allows recipients to verify both the original (if any) and\n   counter\
    \ signatures.  The original S/MIME signature generated by the\n   sender (if any)\
    \ is unaffected by additional S/MIME review signatures.\n"

- title: 3.2.  Handling of Initial Message Submission by the MSA
  contents:
  - "3.2.  Handling of Initial Message Submission by the MSA\n   The original email\
    \ message to be sent doesn't include the MMHS-\n   Authorizing-Users header field.\
    \  It may or may not include the\n   sender's S/MIME signature.\n   The message\
    \ to be sent is first submitted over SMTP [RFC6409].  The\n   specific mechanism\
    \ for how it arrives to the Authorizing User(s) is\n   not specified in this document.\
    \  One possibility is for the Message\n   Submission Agent (MSA) to redirect all\
    \ email messages not addressed\n   to Authorizing Users and not submitted by Authorizing\
    \ Users to a\n   preconfigured mailbox(es) that can be accessed by Authorizing\n\
    \   User(s).  Another possibility is for the MSA to redirect all email\n   messages\
    \ without the MMHS-Authorizing-Users header field and/or\n   corresponding S/MIME\
    \ review signatures to a preconfigured mailbox(es)\n   that can be accessed by\
    \ Authorizing User(s).\n   In order to prevent a malicious sender from bypassing\
    \ or altering the\n   Draft and Release procedure, the MSA MUST check that the\
    \ MMHS-\n   Authorizing-Users header field (if present) is syntactically valid,\n\
    \   contains the email addresses of entities authorized to act as\n   Authorizing\
    \ Users, and, when review signatures are used, that every\n   entity listed has\
    \ one or more matching review signature (or\n   signature) that is valid.\n"
- title: 3.3.  Review by Authorizing User(s)
  contents:
  - "3.3.  Review by Authorizing User(s)\n   Each user agent (UA) that is used by\
    \ an authorized user MUST perform\n   the following steps (if there are multiple\
    \ Authorizing Users, the\n   whole sequence of steps below is repeated for each\
    \ Authorizing User):\n   1.  Verify the origination of the message (From/Sender\
    \ header\n       fields).  The exact mechanism to do that is out of scope for\
    \ this\n       document, but one example is by verifying the S/MIME signature,\n\
    \       making sure that the signature protects all header fields (i.e.,\n   \
    \    wrapped by message/rfc822, as described in Section 3.1 of\n       [RFC5751])\
    \ and that it matches the sender of the message, as\n       described in [RFC5750].\
    \  Another example is by verifying a DKIM\n       signature [RFC6376] (added by\
    \ the Drafter's Mail User Agent (MUA)\n       or MSA) that covers the From/Sender\
    \ header fields.\n   2.  Check if the message already contains the MMHS-Authorizing-Users\n\
    \       header field with the email address of the Authorizing User.\n       (This\
    \ can happen, for example, if the email system is\n       misconfigured and thus\
    \ contains a loop, or if a malicious sender\n       or attacker is trying to affect\
    \ the authorization procedure.)  If\n       the message doesn't contain the email\
    \ address of the Authorizing\n       User in the MMHS-Authorizing-Users header\
    \ field, then go to the\n       next step.  If the MMHS-Authorizing-Users header\
    \ field contains\n       the email address of the Authorizing User, verify the\
    \ validity of\n       the header field (for example, by checking for the S/MIME\n\
    \       signature/review signature or for the DKIM signature) and also\n     \
    \  verify that the email address associated with the signature\n       matches\
    \ the email address of the Authorizing User.  If the\n       validity of the MMHS-Authorizing-Users\
    \ header field can be\n       verified, go to step 5 below.  Otherwise, return\
    \ the message to\n       the sender (bounce) or redirect the message to a designated\
    \ abuse\n       mailbox.\n   3.  Allow the Authorizing User to review the content\
    \ of the message.\n       Some of the checks can be automated (for example, search\
    \ for\n       keywords).  (See Section 3.3.1 for additional considerations.)\n\
    \       If, based on the check, the Authorizing User is happy to release\n   \
    \    the message to the MTS (or to the next Authorizing User, if\n       multiple\
    \ authorizations are required), the UA SHOULD enable the\n       Authorizing User\
    \ to protect additions to the MMHS-Authorizing-\n       Users header field, for\
    \ example, by allowing the addition of the\n       S/MIME review signature (if\
    \ S/MIME is used for protecting the\n       MMHS-Authorizing-Users header field.\
    \  See Section 3.3.2 for more\n       details).  If the Authorizing User wants\
    \ to reject the message,\n       it SHOULD be returned to the Drafter with an\
    \ explanatory note or\n       it MAY be discarded.  The Authorizing User can also\
    \ choose to\n       forward the message to another Authorizing User for additional\n\
    \       approval or become a new Drafter of the message.  If the\n       Authorizing\
    \ User becomes the new Drafter, its UA MUST strip any\n       existing email addresses\
    \ from the MMHS-Authorizing-Users header\n       field.\n   4.  If there is an\
    \ existing MMHS-Authorizing-Users header field\n       containing the email address\
    \ of the Authorizing User, skip this\n       step.  Otherwise, insert a new MMHS-Authorizing-Users\
    \ header\n       field (if absent) containing the email address of the Authorizing\n\
    \       User or append the email address of the Authorizing User to the\n    \
    \   end of the existing MMHS-Authorizing-Users header field.\n   5.  The (possibly)\
    \ updated email message is either released to the\n       MTS or to the next Authorizing\
    \ User, as per email system\n       configuration.  Note that if the Authorizing\
    \ User updates the\n       message in a manner that invalidates existing S/MIME\
    \ or DKIM\n       signature(s), the Authorizing User becomes the Drafter and needs\n\
    \       to reapply any protections.\n"
- title: 3.3.1.  Processing of Encrypted Messages
  contents:
  - "3.3.1.  Processing of Encrypted Messages\n   Any encrypted message sent in an\
    \ environment where the Draft and\n   Release procedure is in force also needs\
    \ to be encrypted to all\n   Authorizing Users, so that they can perform review\
    \ of the message.\n   If a User Agent used by an Authorizing User can't decrypt\
    \ the\n   message, it SHOULD notify the sender (which can be the Drafter or a\n\
    \   previous Authorizing User) about the problem using a non-delivery\n   Delivery\
    \ Status Notification (DSN) or through some other means.  The\n   ciphertext that\
    \ cannot be decrypted by the Authorizing User MAY be\n   included in the notification\
    \ to aid debugging.  A possible reason not\n   to notify the sender is to avoid\
    \ Denial-of-Service attacks, for\n   example, if an attacker discovers a way to\
    \ inject fake messages with\n   encryption that doesn't validate in order to overflow\
    \ the sender's\n   INBOX.\n"

    \ User can become the original\n   signer of the message.\n   If a message is\
    \ signed with multiple signatures (for example, using\n   different cryptographic\
    \ algorithms, as described in [RFC5752]), all\n   of the signatures that can be\
    \ verified by an Authorizing User SHOULD\n   be signed with a review signature\
    \ (authorizing signatures).  A\n   recipient of the message can consider any chain\
    \ of review signatures\n   that matches MMHS-Authorizing-Users header field values\
    \ as valid,\n   only if all signatures in the chain are verified.  All of the\n\
    \   signatures that cannot be verified MUST be stripped by the\n   Authorizing\
    \ User Agent.\n   When triple wrapping [RFC2634] is used, authorizing signatures\
    \ are\n   applied to the outer level, so that it can be verified by Message\n\
