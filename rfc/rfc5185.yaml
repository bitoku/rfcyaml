  contents:
  - "1.1.  Motivation\n   It is often a requirement to have an Open Shortest Path\
    \ First (OSPF)\n   [OSPF] link in multiple areas.  This will allow the link to\
    \ be\n   considered as an intra-area path in each area and be preferred over\n\
    \   higher cost links.  A simple example of this requirement is to use a\n   high-speed\
    \ link between two Area Border Routers (ABRs)in multiple\n   areas.\n   Consider\
    \ the following topology:\n                          R1-------Backbone------R2\n\
    \                           |                      |\n                       \
    \  Area 1                 Area 1\n                           |               \
    \       |\n                          R3--------Area 1--------R4\n            \
    \                Multi-Link Topology\n   The backbone area link between R1 and\
    \ R2 is a high-speed link, and it\n   is desirable to forward Area 1's traffic\
    \ between R1 and R2 over that\n   link.  In the current OSPF specification [OSPF],\
    \ intra-area paths are\n   preferred over inter-area paths.  As a result, R1 will\
    \ always route\n   traffic to R4 through Area 1 over the lower speed links.  R1\
    \ will\n   even use the intra-area Area 1 path though R3 to get to Area 1\n  \
    \ networks connected to R2.  An OSPF virtual link cannot be used to\n   solve\
    \ this problem without moving the link between R1 and R2 to Area\n   1.  This\
    \ is not desirable if the physical link is, in fact, part of\n   the network's\
    \ backbone topology.\n   The protocol extension described herein will rectify\
    \ this problem by\n   allowing the link between R1 and R2 to be part of both the\
    \ backbone\n   area and Area 1.\n"
- title: 1.2.  Possible Solutions
  contents:
  - "1.2.  Possible Solutions\n   For numbered interfaces, the OSPF (Open Shortest\
    \ Path First)\n   specification [OSPF] allows a separate OSPF interface to be\n\
    \   configured in each area using a secondary address.  The disadvantages\n  \
    \ of this approach are that it requires additional IP address\n   configuration,\
    \ it doesn't apply to unnumbered interfaces, and\n   advertising secondary addresses\
    \ will result in a larger overall\n   routing table.\n   Allowing a link with\
    \ a single address to simply be configured in\n   multiple areas would also solve\
    \ the problem.  However, this would\n   result in the subnet corresponding to\
    \ the interface residing in\n   multiple areas that is contrary to the definition\
    \ of an OSPF area as\n   a collection of subnets.\n   Another approach is to simply\
    \ allow unnumbered links to be configured\n   in multiple areas.  Section 8.2.\
    \ of the OSPF specification [OSPF]\n   already specifies that the OSPF area ID\
    \ should be used to de-\n   multiplex received OSPF packets.  One limitation of\
    \ this approach is\n   that multi-access networks are not supported.  Although\
    \ this\n   limitation may be overcome for LAN media with support of \"Point-to-\n\
    \   Point operation over LAN in link-state routing protocols\" [P2PLAN],\n   it\
    \ may not be acceptable to configure the link as unnumbered due to\n   network\
    \ management policies.  Many popular network management\n   applications individually\
    \ test the path to each interface by pinging\n   its IP address.\n"
- title: 1.3.  Proposed Solution
  contents:
  - "1.3.  Proposed Solution\n   ABRs will simply establish multiple adjacencies belonging\
    \ to\n   different areas.  Each multi-area adjacency is announced as a point-\n\
    \   to-point link in the configured area.  However, unlike numbered\n   point-to-point\
    \ links, no type 3 link is advertised for multi-area\n   adjacencies.  This point-to-point\
    \ link will provide a topological\n   path for that area.  The first or primary\
    \ adjacency using the link\n   will operate and advertise the link in a manner\
    \ consistent with RFC\n   2328 [OSPF].\n"

    \ adjacencies are configured between two routers having a\n   common interface.\
    \  On point-to-point interfaces, there is no need to\n   configure the neighbor's\
    \ address since there can be only one\n   neighbor.  For all other network types,\

- title: 2.3.  Multi-Area Adjacency Control Packet Reception Changes
  contents:
  - "2.3.  Multi-Area Adjacency Control Packet Reception Changes\n   Receiving protocol\
    \ packets is described in Section 8.2 of [OSPF].\n   The text starting with the\
    \ second paragraph and continuing through\n   the third bullet beneath that paragraph\
    \ is changed as follows:\n   Next, the OSPF packet header is verified.  The fields\
    \ specified in\n   the header must match those configured for the receiving interface.\n\
    \   If they do not, the packet should be discarded:\n   o  The version number\
    \ field must specify protocol version 2.\n   o  The Area ID found in the OSPF\
    \ header must be verified.  If all of\n      the following cases fail, the packet\
    \ should be discarded.  The\n      Area ID specified in the header must either:\n\
    \      1.  Match the Area ID of the receiving interface.  In this case,\n    \
    \      the packet has been sent over a single hop.  Therefore, the\n         \
    \ packet's IP source address is required to be on the same\n          network\
    \ as the receiving interface.  This can be verified by\n          comparing the\
    \ packet's IP source address to the interface's IP\n          address, after masking\
    \ both addresses with the interface mask.\n          This comparison should not\
    \ be performed on point-to-point\n          networks.  On point-to-point networks,\
    \ the interface addresses\n          of each end of the link are assigned independently,\
    \ if they\n          are assigned at all.\n      2.  Indicate a non-backbone area.\
    \  In this case, the packet has\n          been sent over a multi-area adjacency.\
    \  If the area-id matches\n          the configured area for a multi-area adjacency,\
    \ the packet is\n          accepted and is from now on associated with the multi-area\n\
    \          adjacency for that area.\n      3.  Indicate the backbone.  In this\
    \ case, the packet has been sent\n          over a virtual link or a multi-area\
    \ adjacency.\n   o  For virtual links, the receiving router must be an ABR, and\
    \ the\n      Router ID specified in the packet (the source router) must be the\n\
    \      other end of a configured virtual link.  The receiving interface\n    \
    \  must also attach to the virtual link's configured transit area.\n      If all\
    \ of these checks succeed, the packet is accepted and is from\n      now on associated\
    \ with the virtual link.\n   o  For multi-area adjacencies, if the area-id matches\
    \ the configured\n      area for the multi-area adjacency, the packet is accepted\
    \ and is\n      from now on associated with the multi-area adjacency for that\n\
    \      area.\n   o  Note that if there is a match for both a virtual link and\
    \ a multi-\n      area adjacency then this is a configuration error that should\
    \ be\n      handled at the configuration level.\n   o  Packets whose IP destination\
    \ is AllDRouters should only be\n      accepted if the state of the receiving\
    \ interface is DR or Backup\n      (see Section 9.1 of [OSPF]).\n   o  [...] \

    \ end of the adjacency to\n   model the adjacency as a point-to-point link.  However,\
    \ the network\n   topology will be easier to represent and troubleshoot if both\n\
    \   neighbors are symmetrically configured as multi-area adjacencies.\n"
- title: 4.  OSPFv3 Applicability
  contents:
  - "4.  OSPFv3 Applicability\n   The mechanisms defined in this document also apply\
    \ to OSPFv3\n   [OSPFV3].  As in OSPF, a multi-area adjacency is advertised as\
    \ a\n   point-to-point link in the advertising router's router-LSA.  Since\n \
    \  OSPFv3 router-LSA links are independent of addressing semantics and\n   unambiguously\
    \ identify OSPFv3 neighbors (refer to Section 3.4.3.1 of\n   [OSPFV3]), the change\
    \ to router-LSA links described in Section 2.7 is\n   not applicable to OSPFv3.\
    \  Furthermore, no prefixes corresponding to\n   the multi-area adjacency are\
    \ advertised in the router's intra-area-\n   prefix-LSA.\n   A link-LSA SHOULD\
    \ NOT be advertised for a multi-area adjacency.  The\n   neighbor's IPv6 link\
    \ local address can be learned in other ways,\n   e.g., it can be extracted from\
    \ the IPv6 header of Hello packets\n   received over the multi-area adjacency.\
    \  The neighbor IPv6 link local\n   address is required for the OSPFv3 route next-hop\
    \ calculation on\n   multi-access networks (refer to Section 3.8.1.1 of [OSPFV3]).\n"
