  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   Each attribute stored in a Lightweight Directory Access\
    \ Protocol\n   (LDAP) directory [RFC4510] has a defined syntax (i.e., data type)\n\
    \   which constrains the structure and format of its values.\n   The description\
    \ of each syntax [RFC4517] specifies how attribute or\n   assertion values [RFC4512]\
    \ conforming to the syntax are normally\n   represented when transferred in LDAP\
    \ operations [RFC4511].  This\n   representation is referred to as the LDAP-specific\
    \ encoding to\n   distinguish it from other methods of encoding attribute values.\n\
    \   This document defines an attribute option, the binary option, which\n   can\
    \ be used in an attribute description [RFC4512] in an LDAP\n   operation to specify\
    \ that the associated attribute values or\n   assertion values are, or are requested\
    \ to be, encoded according to\n   the Basic Encoding Rules (BER) [BER] as used\
    \ by X.500 [X.500]\n   directories, instead of the usual LDAP-specific encoding.\n\
    \   The binary option was originally defined in RFC 2251 [RFC2251].  The\n   LDAP\
    \ technical specification [RFC4510] has obsoleted the previously\n   defined LDAP\
    \ technical specification [RFC3377], which included RFC\n   2251.  The binary\
    \ option was not included in the revised LDAP\n   technical specification for\
    \ a variety of reasons including\n   implementation inconsistencies.  No attempt\
    \ is made here to resolve\n   the known inconsistencies.\n   This document reintroduces\
    \ the binary option for use with certain\n   attribute syntaxes, such as certificate\
    \ syntax [RFC4523], that\n   specifically require it.  No attempt has been made\
    \ to address use of\n   the binary option with attributes of syntaxes that do\
    \ not require its\n   use.  Unless addressed in a future specification, this use\
    \ is to be\n   avoided.\n"
- title: 2.  Conventions
  contents:
  - "2.  Conventions\n   The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\"\
    , \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and\
    \ \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n   document are to be interpreted as described in BCP\
    \ 14, RFC 2119\n   [BCP14].\n"
- title: 3.  The Binary Option
  contents:
  - "3.  The Binary Option\n   The binary option is indicated with the attribute option\
    \ string\n   \"binary\" in an attribute description.  Note that, like all attribute\n\
    \   options, the string representing the binary option is case\n   insensitive.\n\
    \   Where the binary option is present in an attribute description, the\n   associated\
    \ attribute values or assertion values MUST be BER encoded\n   (otherwise the\
    \ values are encoded according to the LDAP-specific\n   encoding [RFC4517] for\
    \ the attribute's syntax).  Note that it is\n   possible for a syntax to be defined\
    \ such that its LDAP-specific\n   encoding is exactly the same as its BER encoding.\n\
    \   In terms of the protocol [RFC4511], the binary option specifies that\n   the\
    \ contents octets of the associated AttributeValue or\n   AssertionValue OCTET\
    \ STRING are a complete BER encoding of the\n   relevant value.\n   The binary\
    \ option is not a tagging option [RFC4512], so the presence\n   of the binary\
    \ option does not specify an attribute subtype.  An\n   attribute description\
    \ containing the binary option references exactly\n   the same attribute as the\
    \ attribute description without the binary\n   option.  The supertype/subtype\
    \ relationships of attributes with\n   tagging options are not altered in any\
    \ way by the presence or absence\n   of the binary option.\n   An attribute description\
    \ SHALL be treated as unrecognized if it\n   contains the binary option and the\
    \ syntax of the attribute does not\n   have an associated ASN.1 type [RFC4517],\
    \ or the BER encoding of\n   values of that type is not supported.\n   The presence\
    \ or absence of the binary option only affects the\n   transfer of attribute and\
    \ assertion values in the protocol; servers\n   store any particular attribute\
    \ value in a format of their choosing.\n"
- title: 4.  Syntaxes Requiring Binary Transfer
  contents:
  - "4.  Syntaxes Requiring Binary Transfer\n   The attribute values of certain attribute\
    \ syntaxes are defined\n   without an LDAP-specific encoding and are required\
    \ to be transferred\n   in the BER-encoded form.  For the purposes of this document,\
    \ these\n   syntaxes are said to have a binary transfer requirement.  The\n  \
    \ certificate, certificate list, certificate pair, and supported\n   algorithm\
    \ syntaxes [RFC4523] are examples of syntaxes with a binary\n   transfer requirement.\
    \  These syntaxes also have an additional\n   requirement that the exact BER encoding\
    \ must be preserved.  Note that\n   this is a property of the syntaxes themselves,\
    \ and not a property of\n   the binary option.  In the absence of this requirement,\
    \ LDAP clients\n   would need to re-encode values using the Distinguished Encoding\
    \ Rules\n   (DER).\n"
- title: 5.  Attributes Returned in a Search
  contents:
  - "5.  Attributes Returned in a Search\n   An LDAP search request [RFC4511] contains\
    \ a list of the attributes\n   (the requested attributes list) to be returned\
    \ from each entry\n   matching the search filter.  An attribute description in\
    \ the\n   requested attributes list also implicitly requests all subtypes of\n\
    \   the attribute type in the attribute description, whether through\n   attribute\
    \ subtyping or attribute tagging option subtyping [RFC4512].\n   The requested\
    \ attributes list MAY contain attribute descriptions with\n   the binary option,\
    \ but MUST NOT contain two attribute descriptions\n   with the same attribute\
    \ type and the same tagging options (even if\n   only one of them has the binary\
    \ option).  The binary option in an\n   attribute description in the requested\
    \ attributes list implicitly\n   applies to all the subtypes of the attribute\
    \ type in the attribute\n   description (however, see Section 7).\n   Attributes\
    \ of a syntax with the binary transfer requirement, if\n   returned, SHALL be\
    \ returned in the binary form (i.e., with the binary\n   option in the attribute\
    \ description and the associated attribute\n   values BER encoded) regardless\
    \ of whether the binary option was\n   present in the request (for the attribute\
    \ or for one of its\n   supertypes).\n   Attributes of a syntax without the binary\
    \ transfer requirement, if\n   returned, SHOULD be returned in the form explicitly\
    \ requested.  That\n   is, if the attribute description in the requested attributes\
    \ list\n   contains the binary option, then the corresponding attribute in the\n\
    \   result SHOULD be in the binary form.  If the attribute description in\n  \
    \ the request does not contain the binary option, then the\n   corresponding attribute\
    \ in the result SHOULD NOT be in the binary\n   form.  A server MAY omit an attribute\
    \ from the result if it does not\n   support the requested encoding.\n   Regardless\
    \ of the encoding chosen, a particular attribute value is\n   returned at most\
    \ once.\n"
- title: 6.  All User Attributes
  contents:
  - "6.  All User Attributes\n   If the list of attributes in a search request is\
    \ empty or contains\n   the special attribute description string \"*\", then all\
    \ user\n   attributes are requested to be returned.\n   Attributes of a syntax\
    \ with the binary transfer requirement, if\n   returned, SHALL be returned in\
    \ the binary form.\n   Attributes of a syntax without the binary transfer requirement\
    \ and\n   having a defined LDAP-specific encoding SHOULD NOT be returned in the\n\
    \   binary form.\n   Attributes of a syntax without the binary transfer requirement\
    \ and\n   without a defined LDAP-specific encoding may be returned in the\n  \
    \ binary form or omitted from the result.\n"
- title: 7.  Conflicting Requests
  contents:
  - "7.  Conflicting Requests\n   A particular attribute could be explicitly requested\
    \ by an attribute\n   description and/or implicitly requested by the attribute\
    \ descriptions\n   of one or more of its supertypes, or by the special attribute\n\
    \   description string \"*\".  If the binary option is present in at least\n \
    \  one, but not all, of these attribute descriptions then the effect of\n   the\
    \ request with respect to binary transfer is implementation\n   defined.\n"
- title: 8.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "8.  Security Considerations\n   When interpreting security-sensitive fields,\
    \ and in particular fields\n   used to grant or deny access, implementations MUST\
    \ ensure that any\n   matching rule comparisons are done on the underlying abstract\
    \ value,\n   regardless of the particular encoding used.\n"
- title: 9.  IANA Considerations
  contents:
  - "9.  IANA Considerations\n   The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) has\
