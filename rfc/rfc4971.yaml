  - "1.  Introduction\n   There are several situations where it is useful for the\
    \ IS-IS [IS-IS]\n   [IS-IS-IP] routers to learn the capabilities of the other\
    \ routers of\n   their IS-IS level, area, or routing domain.  For the sake of\n\
    \   illustration, three examples related to MPLS Traffic Engineering (TE)\n  \
    \ are described here:\n   1. Mesh-group: the setting up of a mesh of TE Label\
    \ Switched Paths\n      (LSPs) [IS-IS-TE] requires some significant configuration\
    \ effort.\n      [AUTOMESH] proposes an auto-discovery mechanism whereby every\n\
    \      Label Switching Router (LSR) of a mesh advertises its mesh-group\n    \
    \  membership by means of IS-IS extensions.\n   2. Point to Multipoint TE LSP\
    \ (P2MP LSP).  A specific sub-TLV\n      ([TE-NODE-CAP]) allows an LSR to advertise\
    \ its Point To Multipoint\n      capabilities ([P2MP] and [P2MP-REQS]).\n   3.\
    \ Inter-area traffic engineering: Advertisement of the IPv4 and/or\n      the\
    \ IPv6 Traffic Engineering Router IDs.\n   The use of IS-IS for Path Computation\
    \ Element (PCE) discovery may\n   also be considered and will be discussed in\
    \ the PCE WG.\n   The capabilities mentioned above require the specification of\
    \ new\n   sub-TLVs carried within the CAPABILITY TLV defined in this document.\n\
    \   Note that the examples above are provided for the sake of\n   illustration.\
    \  This document proposes a generic capability\n   advertising mechanism that\
    \ is not limited to MPLS Traffic\n   Engineering.\n   This document defines a\
    \ new optional IS-IS TLV named CAPABILITY,\n   formed of multiple sub-TLVs, which\
    \ allows a router to announce its\n   capabilities within an IS-IS level or the\
    \ entire routing domain.  The\n   applications mentioned above require the specification\
    \ of new sub-\n   TLVs carried within the CAPABILITY TLV defined in this document.\n\
    \   Definition of these sub-TLVs is outside the scope of this document.\n"

- title: 2.  IS-IS Router CAPABILITY TLV
  contents:
  - "2.  IS-IS Router CAPABILITY TLV\n   The IS-IS Router CAPABILITY TLV is composed\
    \ of 1 octet for the type,\n   1 octet that specifies the number of bytes in the\
    \ value field, and a\n   variable length value field that starts with 4 octets\
    \ of Router ID,\n   indicating the source of the TLV, and followed by 1 octet\
    \ of flags.\n   A set of optional sub-TLVs may follow the flag field.  Sub-TLVs\
    \ are\n   formatted as described in RFC 3784 [IS-IS-TE].\n   TYPE: 242\n   LENGTH:\
    \ from 5 to 255\n   VALUE:\n     Router ID (4 octets)\n     Flags (1 octet)\n\
    \     Set of optional sub-TLVs (0-250 octets)\n   Flags\n             0 1 2 3\

    \           +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+\n   Currently two bit flags are defined.\n   S bit\
    \ (0x01): If the S bit is set(1), the IS-IS Router CAPABILITY TLV\n   MUST be\
    \ flooded across the entire routing domain.  If the S bit is\n   not set(0), the\
    \ TLV MUST NOT be leaked between levels.  This bit MUST\n   NOT be altered during\
    \ the TLV leaking.\n   D bit (0x02): When the IS-IS Router CAPABILITY TLV is leaked\
    \ from\n   level-2 to level-1, the D bit MUST be set.  Otherwise, this bit MUST\n\
    \   be clear.  IS-IS Router capability TLVs with the D bit set MUST NOT\n   be\
    \ leaked from level-1 to level-2.  This is to prevent TLV looping.\n   The Router\
    \ CAPABILITY TLV is OPTIONAL.  As specified in Section 3,\n   more than one Router\
    \ CAPABILITY TLV from the same source MAY be\n   present.\n   This document does\
    \ not specify how an application may use the Router\n   Capability TLV and such\
    \ specification is outside the scope of this\n   document.\n"
- title: 3.  Elements of Procedure
  contents:
  - "3.  Elements of Procedure\n   A router that generates a CAPABILITY TLV MUST have\
    \ a Router ID that\n   is a 32-bit number.  The ID MUST be unique within the IS-IS\
    \ area.  If\n   the router generates any capability TLVs with domain flooding\
    \ scope,\n   then the ID MUST also be unique within the IS-IS routing domain.\n\
    \   When advertising capabilities with different flooding scopes, a\n   router\
    \ MUST originate a minimum of two Router CAPABILITY TLVs, each\n   TLV carrying\
    \ the set of sub-TLVs with the same flooding scope.  For\n   instance, if a router\
    \ advertises two sets of capabilities, C1 and C2,\n   with an area/level scope\
    \ and routing domain scope respectively, C1\n   and C2 being specified by their\
    \ respective sub-TLV(s), the router\n   will originate two Router CAPABILITY TLVs:\n\
    \   -  One Router CAPABILITY TLV with the S flag cleared, carrying the\n     \
    \ sub-TLV(s) relative to C1.  This Router CAPABILITY TLV will not be\n      leaked\
    \ into another level.\n   -  One Router CAPABILITY TLV with the S flag set, carrying\
    \ the sub-\n      TLV(s) relative to C2.  This Router CAPABILITY TLV will be leaked\n\
    \      into other IS-IS levels.  When the TLV is leaked from level-2 to\n    \
    \  level-1, the D bit will be set in the level-1 LSP advertisement.\n   In order\
    \ to prevent the use of stale capabilities, a system MUST NOT\n   use a Capability\
    \ TLV present in an LSP of a system that is not\n   currently reachable via Level-x\
    \ paths, where \"x\" is the level (1 or\n   2) in which the sending system advertised\
    \ the TLV.  This requirement\n   applies regardless of whether or not the sending\
    \ system is the\n   originator of the Capabilities TLV.  Note that leaking a Capabilities\n\
    \   TLV is one of the uses that is prohibited under these conditions.\n      Example:\
    \ If Level-1 router A generates a Capability TLV and floods\n      it to two L1/L2\
    \ routers, S and T, they will flood it into the\n      Level-2 domain.  Now suppose\
    \ the Level-1 area partitions, such\n      that A and S are in one partition and\
    \ T is in another.  IP routing\n      will still continue to work, but if A now\
    \ issues a revised version\n      of the CAP TLV, or decides to stop advertising\
    \ it, S will follow\n      suit, but T will continue to advertise the old version\
    \ until the\n      LSP times out.\n   Routers in other areas have to choose whether\
    \ to trust T's copy of\n   A's capabilities or S's copy of A's information and,\
    \ they have no\n   reliable way to choose.  By making sure that T stops leaking\
    \ A's\n   information, this removes the possibility that other routers will use\n\
    \   stale information from A.\n   In IS-IS, the atomic unit of the update process\
    \ is a TLV -- or more\n   precisely, in the case of TLVs that allow multiple entries\
    \ to appear\n   in the value field (e.g., IS-neighbors), the atomic unit is an\
    \ entry\n   in the value field of a TLV.  If an update to an entry in a TLV is\n\
    \   advertised in an LSP fragment different from the LSP fragment\n   associated\
    \ with the old advertisement, the possibility exists that\n   other systems can\
    \ temporarily have either 0 copies of a particular\n   advertisement or 2 copies\
    \ of a particular advertisement, depending on\n   the order in which new copies\
    \ of the LSP fragment that had the old\n   advertisement and the fragment that\
    \ has the new advertisement arrive\n   at other systems.\n   Wherever possible,\
    \ an implementation SHOULD advertise the update to a\n   capabilities TLV in the\
    \ same LSP fragment as the advertisement that\n   it replaces.  Where this is\
    \ not possible, the two affected LSP\n   fragments should be flooded as an atomic\
    \ action.\n   Systems that receive an update to an existing capability TLV can\n\
    \   minimize the potential disruption associated with the update by\n   employing\
    \ a holddown time prior to processing the update so as to\n   allow for the receipt\
    \ of multiple LSP fragments associated with the\n   same update prior to beginning\
    \ processing.\n   Where a receiving system has two copies of a capabilities TLV\
    \ from\n   the same system that have different settings for a given attribute,\n\
    \   the procedure used to choose which copy shall be used is undefined.\n"

  - "4.  Interoperability with Routers Not Supporting the Capability TLV\n   Routers\
    \ that do not support the Router CAPABILITY TLV MUST silently\n   ignore the TLV(s)\
    \ and continue processing other TLVs in the same LSP.\n   Routers that do not\
    \ support specific sub-TLVs carried within a Router\n   CAPABILITY TLV MUST silently\

    \ the operation of the\n   capabilities advertised within the Router CAPABILITY\
    \ TLV is outside\n   the scope of this document.\n   In order for Router CAPABILITY\
    \ TLVs with domain-wide scope originated\n   by L1 Routers to be flooded across\
    \ the entire domain, at least one\n   L1/L2 Router in every area of the domain\
    \ MUST support the Router\n   CAPABILITY TLV.\n   If leaking of the CAPABILITY\
    \ TLV is required, the entire CAPABILITY\n   TLV MUST be leaked into another level\
    \ even though it may contain some\n   of the unsupported sub-TLVs.\n"

  - "5.  Security Considerations\n   Any new security issues raised by the procedures\
    \ in this document\n   depend upon the opportunity for LSPs to be snooped and\
    \ modified, the\n   ease/difficulty of which has not been altered.  As the LSPs\
    \ may now\n   contain additional information regarding router capabilities, this\n\
    \   new information would also become available to an attacker.\n   Specifications\
    \ based on this mechanism need to describe the security\n   considerations around\
    \ the disclosure and modification of their\n   information.  Note that an integrity\
    \ mechanism, such as the one\n   defined in [RFC-3567] or [IS-IS-HMAC], should\
    \ be applied if there is\n   high risk resulting from modification of capability\
    \ information.\n"
