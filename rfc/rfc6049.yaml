- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   The IP Performance Metrics (IPPM) framework [RFC2330] describes\
    \ two\n   forms of metric composition: spatial and temporal.  The composition\n\
    \   framework [RFC5835] expands and further qualifies these original\n   forms\
    \ into three categories.  This memo describes spatial\n   composition, one of\
    \ the categories of metrics under the umbrella of\n   the composition framework.\n\
    \   Spatial composition encompasses the definition of performance metrics\n  \
    \ that are applicable to a complete path, based on metrics collected on\n   various\
    \ sub-paths.\n   The main purpose of this memo is to define the deterministic\n\
    \   functions that yield the complete path metrics using metrics of the\n   sub-paths.\
    \  The effectiveness of such metrics is dependent on their\n   usefulness in analysis\
    \ and applicability with practical measurement\n   methods.\n   The relationships\
    \ may involve conjecture, and [RFC2330] lists four\n   points that the metric\
    \ definitions should include:\n   o  the specific conjecture applied to the metric\
    \ and assumptions of\n      the statistical model of the process being measured\
    \ (if any; see\n      [RFC2330], Section 12),\n   o  a justification of the practical\
    \ utility of the composition in\n      terms of making accurate measurements of\
    \ the metric on the path,\n   o  a justification of the usefulness of the composition\
    \ in terms of\n      making analysis of the path using A-frame concepts more effective,\n\
    \      and\n   o  an analysis of how the conjecture could be incorrect.\n   Also,\
    \ [RFC2330] gives an example using the conjecture that the delay\n   of a path\
    \ is very nearly the sum of the delays of the exchanges and\n   clouds of the\
    \ corresponding path digest.  This example is\n   particularly relevant to those\
    \ who wish to assess the performance of\n   an inter-domain path without direct\
    \ measurement, and the performance\n   estimate of the complete path is related\
    \ to the measured results for\n   various sub-paths instead.\n   Approximate functions\
    \ between the sub-path and complete path metrics\n   are useful, with knowledge\
    \ of the circumstances where the\n   relationships are/are not applicable.  For\
    \ example, we would not\n   expect that delay singletons from each sub-path would\
    \ sum to produce\n   an accurate estimate of a delay singleton for the complete\
    \ path\n   (unless all the delays were essentially constant -- very unlikely).\n\
    \   However, other delay statistics (based on a reasonable sample size)\n   may\
    \ have a sufficiently large set of circumstances where they are\n   applicable.\n"
- title: 1.1.  Motivation
  contents:
  - "1.1.  Motivation\n   One-way metrics defined in other RFCs (such as [RFC2679]\
    \ and\n   [RFC2680]) all assume that the measurement can be practically carried\n\
    \   out between the source and the destination of interest.  Sometimes\n   there\
    \ are reasons that the measurement cannot be executed from the\n   source to the\
    \ destination.  For instance, the measurement path may\n   cross several independent\
    \ domains that have conflicting policies,\n   measurement tools and methods, and\
    \ measurement time assignment.  The\n   solution then may be the composition of\
    \ several sub-path\n   measurements.  This means each domain performs the one-way\n\
    \   measurement on a sub-path between two nodes that are involved in the\n   complete\
    \ path, following its own policy, using its own measurement\n   tools and methods,\
    \ and using its own measurement timing.  Under the\n   appropriate conditions,\
    \ one can combine the sub-path one-way metric\n   results to estimate the complete\
    \ path one-way measurement metric with\n   some degree of accuracy.\n"

    MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n   document are to be interpreted as described\

- title: 2.1.  Scope of Work
  contents:
  - "2.1.  Scope of Work\n   For the primary IP Performance Metrics RFCs for loss\
    \ [RFC2680], delay\n   [RFC2679], and delay variation [RFC3393], this memo gives\
    \ a set of\n   metrics that can be composed from the same or similar sub-path\n\
    \   metrics.  This means that the composition function may utilize:\n   o  the\
    \ same metric for each sub-path;\n   o  multiple metrics for each sub-path (possibly\
    \ one that is the same\n      as the complete path metric);\n   o  a single sub-path\
    \ metric that is different from the complete path\n      metric;\n   o  different\
    \ measurement techniques like active [RFC2330], [RFC3432]\n      and passive [RFC5474].\n\
    \   We note a possibility: using a complete path metric and all but one\n   sub-path\
    \ metric to infer the performance of the missing sub-path,\n   especially when\
    \ the \"last\" sub-path metric is missing.  However, such\n   de-composition calculations,\
    \ and the corresponding set of issues they\n   raise, are beyond the scope of\
    \ this memo.\n"
- title: 2.2.  Application
  contents:
  - "2.2.  Application\n   The composition framework [RFC5835] requires the specification\
    \ of the\n   applicable circumstances for each metric.  In particular, each\n\
    \   section addresses whether the metric:\n   o  Requires the same test packets\
    \ to traverse all sub-paths or may\n      use similar packets sent and collected\
    \ separately in each\n      sub-path.\n   o  Requires homogeneity of measurement\
    \ methodologies or can allow a\n      degree of flexibility (e.g., active, active\
    \ spatial division\n      [RFC5644], or passive methods produce the \"same\" metric).\
    \  Also,\n      the applicable sending streams will be specified, such as Poisson,\n\
    \      Periodic, or both.\n   o  Needs information or access that will only be\
    \ available within an\n      operator's domain, or is applicable to inter-domain\
    \ composition.\n   o  Requires synchronized measurement start and stop times in\
    \ all\n      sub-paths or largely overlapping measurement intervals, or no\n \
    \     timing requirements.\n   o  Requires the assumption of sub-path independence\
    \ with regard to\n      the metric being defined/composed or other assumptions.\n\
    \   o  Has known sources of inaccuracy/error and identifies the sources.\n"
- title: 2.3.  Incomplete Information
  contents:
  - "2.3.  Incomplete Information\n   In practice, when measurements cannot be initiated\
    \ on a sub-path (and\n   perhaps the measurement system gives up during the test\
    \ interval),\n   then there will not be a value for the sub-path reported, and\
    \ the\n   entire test result SHOULD be recorded as \"undefined\".  This case\n\
    \   should be distinguished from the case where the measurement system\n   continued\
    \ to send packets throughout the test interval, but all were\n   declared lost.\n\
    \   When a composed metric requires measurements from sub-paths A, B, and\n  \
    \ C, and one or more of the sub-path results are undefined, then the\n   composed\
    \ metric SHOULD also be recorded as undefined.\n"

  - "3.  Common Specifications for Composed Metrics\n   To reduce the redundant information\
    \ presented in the detailed metrics\n   sections that follow, this section presents\
    \ the specifications that\n   are common to two or more metrics.  The section\
    \ is organized using\n   the same subsections as the individual metrics, to simplify\n\
    \   comparisons.\n   Also, the index variables are represented as follows:\n \

  contents:
  - "3.1.7.  Justification of the Composition Function\n   It is sometimes impractical\
    \ to conduct active measurements between\n   every Src-Dst pair.  Since the full\
    \ mesh of N measurement points\n   grows as N x N, the scope of measurement may\
    \ be limited by testing\n   resources.\n   There may be varying limitations on\
    \ active testing in different parts\n   of the network.  For example, it may not\
    \ be possible to collect the\n   desired sample size in each test interval when\
    \ access link speed is\n   limited, because of the potential for measurement traffic\
    \ to degrade\n   the user traffic performance.  The conditions on a low-speed\
    \ access\n   link may be understood well enough to permit use of a small sample\n\
    \   size/rate, while a larger sample size/rate may be used on other\n   sub-paths.\n\
    \   Also, since measurement operations have a real monetary cost, there\n   is\
    \ value in re-using measurements where they are applicable, rather\n   than launching\
    \ new measurements for every possible source-destination\n   pair.\n"

    \ for most metrics (see the metric-specific\n   sections).\n   For delay-related\
    \ metrics, one-way delay always depends on packet\n   size and link capacity,\
    \ since it is measured in [RFC2679] from first\n   bit to last bit.  If the size\
    \ of an IP packet changes on its route\n   (due to encapsulation), this can influence\
    \ delay performance.\n   However, the main error source may be the additional\
    \ processing\n   associated with encapsulation and encryption/decryption if not\n\
    \   experienced or accounted for in sub-path measurements.\n   Fragmentation is\
    \ a major issue for composition accuracy, since all\n   metrics require all fragments\
    \ to arrive before proceeding, and\n   fragmented complete path performance is\
    \ likely to be different from\n   performance with non-fragmented packets and\
    \ composed metrics based on\n   non-fragmented sub-path measurements.\n   Highly\
    \ manipulated routing can cause measurement error if not\n   expected and compensated\
