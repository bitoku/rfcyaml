  - "1.  Introduction\n   The IETF has specified the Port Control Protocol (PCP) [RFC6887]
    to\n   control how packets are translated and/or forwarded by a PCP-\n   controlled
    device such as a Network Address Translator (NAT) or a\n   firewall.\n   This
    document focuses on scenarios where the PCP client sends\n   requests that concern
    internal addresses other than the address of\n   the PCP client itself.\n   There
    is already an option defined for this purpose in [RFC6887]\n   called the THIRD_PARTY
    option.  The THIRD_PARTY option carries the IP\n   address of a host for which
    a PCP client requests an action at the\n   PCP server.  For example, the THIRD_PARTY
    option can be used if port\n   mapping requests for a Carrier-Grade NAT (CGN)
    are not sent from PCP\n   clients at subscriber terminals but instead from a PCP
    Interworking\n   Function (IWF), which requests port mappings.\n   In some cases,
    the THIRD_PARTY option alone is not sufficient and\n   further means are needed
    for identifying the third party.  Such cases\n   are addressed by the THIRD_PARTY_ID
    option, which is specified in\n   this document.\n   The primary issue addressed
    by the THIRD_PARTY_ID option is that\n   there are CGN deployments that do not
    distinguish internal hosts by\n   their IP address alone, but use further identifiers
    (IDs) for unique\n   subscriber identification.  For example, this is the case
    if a CGN\n   supports overlapping private or shared IP address spaces [RFC1918]\n
    \  [RFC6598] for internal hosts of different subscribers.  In such\n   cases,
    different internal hosts are identified and mapped at the CGN\n   by their IP
    address and/or another ID, for example, the ID of a\n   tunnel between the CGN
    and the subscriber.  In these scenarios (and\n   similar ones), the internal IP
    address contained in the THIRD_PARTY\n   option is not sufficient to demultiplex
    connections from internal\n   hosts.  An additional identifier needs to be present
    in the PCP\n   message in order to uniquely identify an internal host.  The\n
    \  THIRD_PARTY_ID option is used to carry this ID.\n   This applies to some of
    the PCP deployment scenarios that are listed\n   in Section 2.1 of [RFC6887],
    in particular to a L2-aware NAT, which\n   is described in more detail in Section
    3, as well as in other\n   scenarios where overlapping address spaces occur like
    in [RFC6674] or\n   [RFC6619].\n   The THIRD_PARTY_ID option is defined for the
    PCP opcodes MAP and PEER\n   to be used together with the THIRD_PARTY option,
    which is specified\n   in [RFC6887].\n"

  - "3.  Target Scenarios\n   This section describes two scenarios that illustrate
    the use of the\n   THIRD_PARTY_ID option:\n   1.  A UPnP IGD-PCP IWF (Universal
    Plug and Play Internet Gateway\n       Device - Port Control Protocol Interworking
    Function [RFC6970]).\n   2.  A carrier web portal for port mapping.\n   These
    are just two examples that illustrate the use and applicability\n   of the THIRD_PARTY_ID
    option.  While these are just two examples,\n   there might be other conceivable
    use cases.  However, the use of the\n   THIRD_PARTY_ID option as specified in
    this document is restricted to\n   scenarios where the option is needed for the
    purpose of uniquely\n   identifying an internal host in addition to the information
    found in\n   the THIRD_PARTY option.\n   Both scenarios elaborated in this document
    are refinements of the\n   same basic scenario shown in Figure 1 that is considered
    as a PCP\n   deployment scenario employing L2-aware NATs as listed in Section
    2.1\n   of [RFC6887].  It has a carrier operating a CGN and a Port Control\n   Protocol
    Interworking Function (PCP IWF) [RFC6970] for subscribers to\n   request port
    mappings at the CGN.  The PCP IWF communicates with the\n   CGN using PCP.  For
    this purpose, the PCP IWF contains a PCP client\n   serving multiple subscribers
    and the CGN is co-located with a PCP\n   server.  The way subscribers interact
    with the PCP IWF for requesting\n   port mappings for their internal hosts is
    not specified in this basic\n   scenario, but it is elaborated on more in the
    specific scenarios in\n   Sections 3.1 and 3.2.\n   The CGN operates as a L2-aware
    NAT.  Unlike a standard NAT, it\n   includes a subscriber identifier in addition
    to the source IP address\n   in entries of the NAT mapping table.\n   +--------------+

    \       Figure 1: Carrier Hosted PCP IWF for Port Mapping Requests\n   Internal
    hosts in the subscriber's network use private IP addresses\n   [RFC1918].  There
    is no NAT between the internal host and the CGN,\n   and there is an overlap of
    addresses used by internal hosts of\n   different subscribers.  That is why the
    CGN needs more than just the\n   internal host's IP address to distinguish internal
    hosts of different\n   subscribers.  A commonly deployed method for solving this
    issue is\n   using an additional identifier for this purpose.  A natural candidate\n
    \  for this additional identifier at the CGN is the ID of the tunnel\n   that
    connects the CGN to the subscriber's network.  The subscriber's\n   Customer Premises
    Equipment (CPE) operates as a Layer 2 bridge.\n   Requests for port mappings from
    the PCP IWF to the CGN need to\n   uniquely identify the internal host for which
    a port mapping is to be\n   established or modified.  Already existing for this
    purpose is the\n   THIRD_PARTY option that can be used to specify the internal
    host's IP\n   address.  The THIRD_PARTY_ID option is introduced for carrying the\n
    \  additional third-party information needed to identify the internal\n   host
    in this scenario.\n   The additional identifier for internal hosts needs to be
    included in\n   MAP requests from the PCP IWF in order to uniquely identify the\n
    \  internal host that should have its address mapped.  This is the\n   purpose
    that the new THIRD_PARTY_ID option serves in this scenario.\n   It carries the
    additional identifier, that is the tunnel ID, that\n   serves for identifying
    an internal host in combination with the\n   internal host's (private) IP address.
    \ The IP address of the internal\n   host is included in the PCP IWF's mapping
    requests by using the\n   THIRD_PARTY option.\n   The information carried by the
    THIRD_PARTY_ID option is not just\n   needed to identify an internal host in a
    PCP request.  The CGN needs\n   this information in its internal mapping tables
    for translating\n   packet addresses and for forwarding packets to subscriber-specific\n
    \  tunnels.\n   How the carrier PCP IWF is managing port mappings, such as, for\n
    \  example, automatically extending the lifetime of a mapping, is beyond\n   the
    scope of this document.\n"

    - "3.1.  Carrier-Hosted UPnP IGD-PCP IWF\n   This scenario further elaborates
      the basic one above by choosing\n   UPnP-IGD as the communication protocol between
      the subscriber and the\n   carrier's PCP IWF.  Then obviously, the PCP IWF is
      realized as a UPnP\n   IGD-PCP IWF as specified in [RFC6970].\n   As shown in
      Figure 2, it is assumed here that the UPnP IGD-PCP IWF is\n   not embedded in
      the subscriber premises router, but offered as a\n   service to the subscriber.
      \ Further, it is assumed that the UPnP IGD-\n   PCP IWF is not providing NAT
      functionality.\n   This requires that the subscriber can connect to the UPnP
      IGD-PCP IWF\n   to request port mappings at the CGN using UPnP-IGD as specified
      in\n   [RFC6970].  In this scenario, the connection is provided via (one of\n
      \  the) tunnel(s) connecting the subscriber's network to the Broadband\n   Remote
      Access Server (BRAS) and an extension of this tunnel from the\n   BRAS to the
      UPnP IGD-PCP IWF.  Note that there are other alternatives\n   that can be used
      for providing the connection to the UPnP IGD-PCP\n   IWF.  The tunnel extension
      used in this scenario can, for example, be\n   realized by a forwarding function
      for UPnP messages at the BRAS that\n   forwards such messages through per-subscriber
      tunnels to the UPnP\n   IGD-PCP IWF.  Depending on an actual implementation,
      the UPnP IGD-PCP\n   IWF can then either use the ID of the tunnel in which the
      UPnP\n   message arrived directly as the THIRD_PARTY_ID option for PCP\n   requests
      to the CGN, or it uses the ID of the tunnel to retrieve the\n   THIRD_PARTY_ID
      option from the Authentication, Authorization, and\n   Accounting (AAA) server.\n
      \  To support the latter option, the BRAS needs to register the\n   subscriber's
      tunnel IDs at the AAA server at the time it contacts the\n   AAA server for
      authentication and/or authorization of the subscriber.\n   The tunnel IDs to
      be registered per subscriber at the AAA server may\n   include the tunnel between
      CPE and BRAS, between BRAS and UPnP IGD-\n   PCP IWF, and between BRAS and CGN.
      \ The UPnP IGD-PCP IWF queries the\n   AAA server for the ID of the tunnel between
      BRAS and CGN, because\n   this is the identifier to be used as the THIRD_PARTY_ID
      option in the\n   subsequent port mapping request.\n   +--------------+    +------------------------------------+\n

    then\n   the encoding rules of that standard must be followed.  As an example,\n
    \  in case a session ID of the Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol version 3\n   (L2TPv3)
    [RFC3931] is being used, then that identifier has to be\n   encoded the same way
    it would be encoded in the L2TPv3 session\n   header.  This allows for a simple
    octet-by-octet comparison at the\n   PCP-controlled device.\n   [RFC6887] expects
    option data to always come in multiples of an\n   octet.  An ID, however, might
    not fulfill this criterion.  As an\n   example, an MPLS label is 20 bits wide.
    \ In these cases, padding is\n   done by appending 0 bits until the byte boundary
    is reached.  After\n   that, the padding rules of [RFC6887] apply.\n   The option
    number is in the mandatory-to-process range (0-127),\n   meaning that a request
    with a THIRD_PARTY_ID option is processed by\n   the PCP server if and only if
    the THIRD_PARTY_ID option is supported\n   by the PCP server.  Therefore, it should
    not be included unless the\n   PCP client is certain that a mapping without the
    THIRD_PARTY_ID is\n   impossible.\n"

      This error occurs if both\n        THIRD_PARTY and THIRD_PARTY_ID options are
      expected in a request\n        but one option is missing.  This is a long lifetime
      error.\n   26:  UNSUPP_THIRD_PARTY_ID_LENGTH: The received option length is
      not\n        supported.  This is a long lifetime error.\n"

      is described in\n   [RFC6887], the following has to be applied.  The THIRD_PARTY_ID\n
      \  option MAY be included either in a PCP MAP or PEER opcode.  It MUST\n   be
      used in combination with the THIRD_PARTY option, which provides an\n   IP address.
      \ The THIRD_PARTY_ID option holds an identifier to allow\n   the PCP-controlled
      device to uniquely identify the internal host\n   (specified in the THIRD_PARTY
      option) for which the port mapping is\n   to be established or modified.  The
      padding rules described in\n   Section 4 apply.\n"

    - "5.2.  Processing a Request\n   The THIRD_PARTY_ID option is in the mandatory-to-process
      range; if\n   the PCP server does not support this option, it MUST return an\n
      \  UNSUPP_OPTION response.  If the provided identifier in a\n   THIRD_PARTY_ID
      option is unknown/unavailable, the PCP server MUST\n   return a THIRD_PARTY_ID_UNKNOWN
      response.  If the PCP server receives\n   a request with an unsupported THIRD_PARTY_ID
      option length, it MUST\n   return an UNSUPP_THIRD_PARTY_ID_LENGTH response.
      \ If the PCP server\n   receives a THIRD_PARTY_ID option without a THIRD_PARTY
      option, it\n   MUST return a THIRD_PARTY_MISSING_OPTION response.\n   Upon receiving
      a valid request with a legal THIRD_PARTY_ID option\n   identifier, the message
      is processed as specified in [RFC6887],\n   except that the identifier contained
      in the THIRD_PARTY_ID is used in\n   addition when accessing a mapping table.
      \ Instead of just using the\n   value contained in the THIRD_PARTY option when
      accessing the internal\n   Internet address of a mapping table, now the combination
      of the two\n   values contained in the THIRD_PARTY option and in the THIRD_PARTY_ID\n
      \  option is used to access the combination of the internal Internet\n   address
      and the internal realm of a NAT map entry.\n   If two or more different tunnel
      technologies are being used,\n   precautions need to be taken to handle potential
      overlap of the ID\n   spaces of these technologies.  For example, different
      PCP client/PCP\n   server pairs can be used per tunnel technology.\n"

  - "7.  Security Considerations\n   This option is to be used in combination with
    the THIRD_PARTY option.\n   Consequently, all corresponding security considerations
    in\n   Section 18.1.1 of [RFC6887] apply.  In particular, the network on\n   which
    the PCP messages are sent must be sufficiently protected.\n   Further, it is RECOMMENDED
    to use PCP authentication [RFC7652] unless\n   the network already has appropriate
    authentication means in place.\n   The THIRD_PARTY_ID option carries a context
    identifier whose type and\n   length is deployment and implementation dependent.
    \ This identifier\n   might carry privacy sensitive information.  It is therefore\n
    \  RECOMMENDED to utilize identifiers that do not have such privacy\n   concerns.
    \ Means to protect unauthorized access to this information\n   MUST be put in
    place.  In the scenarios described in this document,\n   for example, access to
    the web portal or UPnP IGD-PCP IWF MUST be\n   authenticated.  Generally speaking,
    the identifier itself MUST only\n   be accessible by the network operator and
    MUST only be handled on\n   operator equipment.  For example, creation of a PCP
    message on the\n   web portal or the UPnP IGD PCP IWF is triggered by the subscriber,\n
    \  but the actual option filling is done by an operator-controlled\n   entity.\n"
