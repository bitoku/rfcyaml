- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   As specified in [RFC4861], when an interface on a host is\n\
    \   initialized, in order to obtain Router Advertisements quickly, a host\n  \
    \ transmits up to MAX_RTR_SOLICITATIONS (3) Router Solicitation (RS)\n   messages,\
    \ each separated by at least RTR_SOLICITATION_INTERVAL (4)\n   seconds.  In certain\
    \ scenarios, these Router Solicitations\n   transmitted by the host might be lost.\
    \  For example, the host is\n   connected to a bridged residential gateway over\
    \ Ethernet or Wi-Fi.\n   LAN connectivity is achieved at interface initialization,\
    \ but the\n   upstream WAN connectivity is not active yet.  In this case, the\
    \ host\n   just gives up after the initial RS retransmits.\n   Once the initial\
    \ RSs are lost, the host gives up and assumes that\n   there are no routers on\
    \ the link as specified in Section 6.3.7 of\n   [RFC4861].  The host will not\
    \ have any form of Internet connectivity\n   until the next unsolicited multicast\
    \ Router Advertisement is\n   received.  These Router Advertisements are transmitted\
    \ at most\n   MaxRtrAdvInterval seconds apart (maximum value 1800 seconds).  Thus,\n\
    \   in the worst-case scenario a host would be without any connectivity\n   for\
    \ 30 minutes.  This delay may be unacceptable in some scenarios.\n"

- title: 2.  Proposed Algorithm
  contents:
  - "2.  Proposed Algorithm\n   To achieve resiliency to packet loss, the host needs\
    \ to continue\n   retransmitting the Router Solicitations until it receives a\
    \ Router\n   Advertisement, or until it is willing to accept that no router\n\
    \   exists.  If the host continues retransmitting the RSs at\n   RTR_SOLICITATION_INTERVAL\
    \ second intervals, it may cause excessive\n   network traffic if a large number\
    \ of such hosts exists.  To achieve\n   resiliency while keeping the aggregate\
    \ network traffic low, the host\n   can use some form of exponential backoff algorithm\
    \ to retransmit the\n   RSs.\n   Hosts complying to this specification MUST use\
    \ the exponential\n   backoff algorithm for retransmits that is described in Section\
    \ 14 of\n   [RFC3315] in order to continuously retransmit the Router\n   Solicitations\
    \ until a Router Advertisement is received.  The hosts\n   SHOULD use the following\
    \ variables as input to the retransmission\n   algorithm:\n        IRT (Initial\
    \ Retransmission Time):     4 seconds\n        MRT (Maximum Retransmission Time):\
    \  3600 seconds\n        MRC (Maximum Retransmission Count):    0\n        MRD\
    \ (Maximum Retransmission Duration): 0\n   The initial value IRT was chosen to\
    \ be in line with the current\n   retransmission interval (RTR_SOLICITATION_INTERVAL)\
    \ that is specified\n   by [RFC4861], and the maximum retransmission time MRT\
    \ was chosen to\n   be in line with the new value of SOL_MAX_RT as specified by\n\
    \   [RFC7083].  This is to ensure that the short-term behavior of the RSs\n  \
    \ is similar to what is experienced in current networks, and that\n   longer-term\
    \ persistent retransmission behavior trends towards being\n   similar to that\
    \ of DHCPv6 [RFC3315] [RFC7083].\n"
- title: 2.1.  Stopping the Retransmissions
  contents:
  - "2.1.  Stopping the Retransmissions\n   On multicast-capable links, the hosts\
    \ following this specification\n   SHOULD stop retransmitting the RSs when Router\
    \ Discovery is\n   successful (i.e., an RA with a non-zero Router Lifetime that\
    \ results\n   in a default route is received).  If an RA is received from a router\n\
    \   and it does not result in a default route (i.e., Router Lifetime is\n   zero),\
    \ the host MUST continue retransmitting the RSs.\n   On non-multicast links, the\
    \ hosts following this specification MUST\n   continue retransmitting the RSs\
    \ even after an RA that results in a\n   default route is received.  This is required\
    \ because, in such links,\n   sending an RA can only be triggered by an RS.  Please\
    \ note that such\n   links have special mechanisms for sending RSs as well.  For\
    \ example,\n   the mechanism specified in Section 8.3.4 of the Intra-Site Automatic\n\
    \   Tunnel Addressing Protocol (ISATAP) [RFC5214] unicasts the RSs to\n   specific\
    \ routers.\n"
- title: 3.  Configuring the Use of Retransmissions
  contents:
  - "3.  Configuring the Use of Retransmissions\n   Implementations of this specification\
    \ are encouraged to provide a\n   configuration option to enable or disable potentially\
    \ infinite RS\n   retransmissions.  If a configuration option is provided, it\
    \ MUST\n   enable RS retransmissions by default.  Providing an option to enable/\n\
    \   disable retransmissions on a per-interface basis allows network\n   operators\
    \ to configure RS behavior in the most applicable way for\n   each connected link.\n"
- title: 4.  Known Limitations
  contents:
  - "4.  Known Limitations\n   When an IPv6-capable host attaches to a network that\
    \ does not have\n   IPv6 enabled, it transmits 3 (MAX_RTR_SOLICITATIONS) Router\n\
    \   Solicitations as specified in [RFC4861].  If it receives no Router\n   Advertisements,\
    \ it assumes that there are no routers present on the\n   link and it ceases to\
    \ send further RSs.  With the mechanism specified\n   in this document, the host\
    \ will continue to retransmit RSs\n   indefinitely at the rate of approximately\
    \ 1 RS per hour.  It is\n   unclear how to differentiate between such a network\
    \ with no IPv6\n   routers and a link where an IPv6 router is temporarily unreachable\n\
    \   but could become reachable in the future.\n"
