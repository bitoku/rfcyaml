  - "3.   Introduction and Overview\n   The ACL extension is present in any IMAP4\
    \ implementation which\n   returns \"ACL\" as one of the supported capabilities\
    \ to the CAPABILITY\n   command.\n   An access control list is a set of <identifier,rights>\
    \ pairs.\n   Identifier is a US-ASCII string.  The identifier anyone is reserved\n\
    \   to refer to the universal identity (all authentications, including\n   anonymous).\
    \ All user name strings accepted by the LOGIN or\n   AUTHENTICATE commands to\
    \ authenticate to the IMAP server are reserved\n   as identifiers for the corresponding\
    \ user.  Identifiers starting with\n   a dash (\"-\") are reserved for \"negative\
    \ rights\", described below.\n   All other identifier strings are interpreted\
    \ in an implementation-\n   defined manner.\n   Rights is a string listing a (possibly\
    \ empty) set of alphanumeric\n   characters, each character listing a set of operations\
    \ which is being\n   controlled. Letters are reserved for ``standard'' rights,\
    \ listed\n   below.  The set of standard rights may only be extended by a\n  \
    \ standards-track document.  Digits are reserved for implementation or\n   site\
    \ defined rights.  The currently defined standard rights are:\n   l - lookup (mailbox\
    \ is visible to LIST/LSUB commands)\n   r - read (SELECT the mailbox, perform\
    \ CHECK, FETCH, PARTIAL,\n       SEARCH, COPY from mailbox)\n   s - keep seen/unseen\
    \ information across sessions (STORE SEEN flag)\n   w - write (STORE flags other\
    \ than SEEN and DELETED)\n   i - insert (perform APPEND, COPY into mailbox)\n\
    \   p - post (send mail to submission address for mailbox,\n       not enforced\
    \ by IMAP4 itself)\n   c - create (CREATE new sub-mailboxes in any implementation-defined\n\
    \       hierarchy)\n   d - delete (STORE DELETED flag, perform EXPUNGE)\n   a\
    \ - administer (perform SETACL)\n   An implementation may tie rights together\
    \ or may force rights to\n   always or never be granted to particular identifiers.\
    \  For example,\n   in an implementation that uses unix mode bits, the rights\
    \ \"wisd\" are\n   tied, the \"a\" right is always granted to the owner of a mailbox\
    \ and\n   is never granted to another user.  If rights are tied in an\n   implementation,\
    \ the implementation must be conservative in granting\n   rights in response to\
    \ SETACL commands--unless all rights in a tied\n   set are specified, none of\
    \ that set should be included in the ACL\n   entry for that identifier.  A client\
    \ may discover the set of rights\n   which may be granted to a given identifier\
    \ in the ACL for a given\n   mailbox by using the LISTRIGHTS command.\n   It is\
    \ possible for multiple identifiers in an access control list to\n   apply to\
    \ a given user (or other authentication identity).  For\n   example, an ACL may\
    \ include rights to be granted to the identifier\n   matching the user, one or\
    \ more implementation-defined identifiers\n   matching groups which include the\
    \ user, and/or the identifier\n   \"anyone\".  How these rights are combined to\
    \ determine the user's\n   access is implementation-defined.  An implementation\
    \ may choose, for\n   example, to use the union of the rights granted to the applicable\n\
    \   identifiers.  An implementation may instead choose, for example, to\n   only\
    \ use those rights granted to the most specific identifier present\n   in the\
    \ ACL. A client may determine the set of rights granted to the\n   logged-in user\
    \ for a given mailbox by using the MYRIGHTS command.\n   When an identifier in\
    \ an ACL starts with a dash (\"-\"), that indicates\n   that associated rights\
    \ are to be removed from the identifier that is\n   prefixed by the dash.  For\
    \ example, if the identifier \"-fred\" is\n   granted the \"w\" right, that indicates\
    \ that the \"w\" right is to be\n   removed from users matching the identifier\
    \ \"fred\".  Implementations\n   need not support having identifiers which start\
    \ with a dash in ACLs.\n"

    \      The SETACL command changes the access control list on the\n      specified\
    \ mailbox so that the specified identifier is granted\n      permissions as specified\
    \ in the third argument.\n      The third argument is a string containing an optional\
    \ plus (\"+\")\n      or minus (\"-\") prefix, followed by zero or more rights\
    \ characters.\n      If the string starts with a plus, the following rights are\
    \ added\n      to any existing rights for the identifier.  If the string starts\n\
    \      with a minus, the following rights are removed from any existing\n    \
    \  rights for the identifier.  If the string does not start with a\n      plus\
    \ or minus, the rights replace any existing rights for the\n      identifier.\n"
