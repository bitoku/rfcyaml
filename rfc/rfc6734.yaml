  - "1.  Introduction\n   The Diameter Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) application\n
    \  [RFC4072] defines the EAP-Master-Session-Key and EAP-Key-Name AVPs\n   for
    the purpose of transporting cryptographic keying material derived\n   during the
    execution of certain Extensible Authentication Protocol\n   (EAP) [RFC3748] methods
    (for example, EAP-TLS [RFC5216]).  At most\n   one instance of either of these
    AVPs is allowed in any Diameter\n   message.\n   However, recent work (see, for
    example, [RFC5295]) has specified\n   methods to derive other keys from the keying
    material created during\n   EAP method execution that may require transport in
    addition to the\n   Master Session Key (MSK).  Also, the EAP Re-authentication
    Protocol\n   (ERP) [RFC6696] specifies new keys that may need to be transported\n
    \  between Diameter nodes.\n   This document specifies a set of AVPs allowing
    the transport of\n   multiple cryptographic keys in a single Diameter message.\n"

        contents of\n   the Keying-Material AVP (Section 3.1.3) is valid.\n   NOTE:\n

        material is received.  In addition, client implementations\n      SHOULD check
        to ensure that the value is reasonable; for example,\n      the lifetime of
        a key should not generally be longer than the\n      session lifetime (see

    \ Some forms of\n   keying material are already protected and can be sent safely
    over the\n   open Internet.  However, if a Key AVP contains a Keying-Material
    AVP\n   that is not already protected, then the Diameter messages containing\n
    \  that Key AVP MUST only be sent protected via mutually authenticated\n   TLS
    or IPsec.\n   The security considerations applicable to the Diameter base protocol\n
