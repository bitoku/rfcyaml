  - "1.  Introduction\n   This memo provides one possible plan for transitioning the\
    \ Internet\n   from a predominantly IPv4-based connectivity model to a predominantly\n\
    \   IPv6-based connectivity model.\n   Other transition plans are possible and\
    \ this purely informational\n   document does not create an obligation on any\
    \ party to undertake any\n   of the actions specified herein, and the use of requirements\
    \ language\n   per RFC 2119 is only for the purpose of clearly describing the\n\
    \   proposed transition plan in unambiguous terms.\n   The motivation for an Internet-wide\
    \ transition plan is to facilitate\n   coordination of expectations among innumerable,\
    \ highly decentralized\n   entities during a period of significant change, thus\
    \ reducing risk to\n   the defining Internet property of universal connectivity.\n\
    \   The purpose of specifying this particular transition plan is to allow\n  \
    \ for overall assessment of the challenges of accomplishing the desired\n   transition\
    \ and to continue the discussion of Internet-wide transition\n   plans in general.\n"

    \ not a\n   Standards Track document, the same key words are used in this\n  \
    \ document only for sake of clarity in describing the proposed\n   transition\
    \ plan.\n"
- title: 2.  A Phased Transition Model
  contents:
  - "2.  A Phased Transition Model\n   It is not reasonable to specify the changes\
    \ that each and every\n   system connected to the Internet must undergo in order\
    \ to achieve the\n   desired transition, as the number of connected systems precludes\n\
    \   creating one plan that contains such a level of detail.  Further,\n   while\
    \ there are common scenarios that may be specified for\n   transitioning individual\
    \ networks (refer to [RFC3750] and [RFC4057]\n   for examples), the specific timeline\
    \ and mechanisms utilized for a\n   given network will be unique.  Despite these\
    \ challenges, it is\n   necessary to coordinate expectations on an overall basis\
    \ so that\n   Internet-wide connectivity is maintained throughout the transition.\n\
    \   This document specifies a three-phase transition plan that includes\n   preparation,\
    \ transition, and post-transition phases, and delineates\n   the necessary activities\
    \ within each phase based on the role that an\n   organization plays in the provision\
    \ and use of Internet services.\n   An important distinction made in this transition\
    \ plan is identifying\n   the explicit requirement for existing end-site organizations\
    \ to add\n   IPv6-based connectivity to their public-facing servers during a\n\
    \   transition phase.  An accelerated adoption of IPv6 for public-facing\n   servers\
    \ enables new organizations in the post-transition phase to be\n   connected to\
    \ the Internet only via IPv6 and still have access to a\n   substantial representative\
    \ base of publicly available servers.\n   For nearly every organization, the task\
    \ of IPv6-enabling their\n   public-facing servers is far easier than undertaking\
    \ an\n   organization-wide adoption of IPv6.  Still, the requirement for\n   existing\
    \ Internet-connected organizations to add IPv6 connectivity\n   (even to a small\
    \ number of systems) will be a significant hurdle and\n   require a level of effort\
    \ that may not be achievable given the lack\n   of compelling additional benefits\
    \ to these organizations [RFC1669].\n   This transition plan presumes that \"\
    connectivity is its own reward\"\n   [RFC1958] and that there still exists a sufficient\
    \ level of\n   cooperation among Internet participants to make this evolution\n\
    \   possible.\n   The three proposed phases are: Preparation Phase, Transition\
    \ Phase,\n   and Post-Transition Phase.  The timeline for the phases has been\
    \ set\n   to allow entry to the Post-Transition Phase prior to the projected\n\
    \   IPv4 address pool exhaustion date [IPUSAGE].\n"

  contents:
  - "2.1.  Preparation Phase - Present to December 2009\n   In the Preparation Phase,\
    \ Service Providers pilot test their IPv6\n   network services, and end-site organizations\
    \ prepare to provide\n   Internet-facing services via IPv6-based connectivity\
    \ while continuing\n   to provide Internet-facing services via IPv4 connectivity.\n\
    \   During the Preparation Phase, the following principles apply:\n   PREP1: Service\
    \ Providers SHOULD offer pilot IPv6-based Internet\n          Service to their\
    \ Internet customers.  IPv6-based Internet\n          Service MAY be provided\
    \ via IPv6 transition mechanisms (such\n          as those described in [RFC4213],\
    \ for example) or via native\n          IPv6 network service.\n   PREP2: Organizations\
    \ SHOULD arrange for IPv6-based Internet\n          connectivity for any Internet-facing\
    \ servers (e.g., web,\n          email, and domain name servers).  Internet-facing\
    \ IPv6 servers\n          in this phase SHOULD use separate service names per\
    \ [RFC4472]\n          to avoid impact to production IPv4-based services unless\
    \ the\n          organization supports production IPv6 connectivity.\n   PREP3:\
    \ Organizations MAY provide IPv6-based Internet connectivity to\n          internal\
    \ user communities.\n"

- title: 3.  Summary
  contents:
  - "3.  Summary\n   In order to facilitate full Internet-wide connectivity during\
    \ the\n   transition from IPv4-based connectivity to IPv6-based connectivity,\
    \ a\n   transition plan which provides clear guidance to organizations\n   regarding\
    \ expectations is necessary.  As the specific expectations\n   change over time,\
    \ and vary greatly by organization, a phased approach\n   is specified in this\
    \ document, with the timeline for each phase set\n   with the intention of allowing\
    \ enough time for the necessary planning\n   and deployment steps which each organization\
    \ much undertake.  This\n   Internet Transition Plan provides for transition to\
    \ predominantly\n   IPv6-connectivity by January 2012 which, with careful management,\
    \ may\n   meet the overall requirements of allowing the Internet to scale as\n\
    \   specified in \"The Recommendation for the IP Next Generation Protocol\"\n\
    \   [RFC1752].\n"

  - "4.  Security Considerations\n   This memo describes the transition of the Internet\
    \ from IPv4-based\n   connectivity to predominantly IPv6-based connectivity. \
    \ This change\n   inherently has security implications due to the widespread deployment\n\
    \   of a new version of the Internet Protocol but these are beyond the\n   scope\
    \ of this document and are covered in [RFC4942].  This document\n   raises no\

  - "5.  IANA Considerations\n   While no new name or identifier space is created\
    \ by this document,\n   the policies for management of Internet Protocol version\
    \ 4 (IPv4)\n   address space may not provide for IPv4 availability through the\n\
    \   Transition Phase as intended by this plan.  The IANA should work with\n  \
    \ all parties to develop policies per [RFC2050] which allow continued\n   general\
    \ availability of IPv4 address resources sufficiently long for\n   any transition\
    \ plan that receives widespread community support.\n"
