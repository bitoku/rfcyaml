  - "Arguments:\n    Standard Implementation:\n         The idea of an accepted implementation\
    \ which does not include\n         whole protocol is an admission that the parts\
    \ of the\n         protocol left out are either not useful or not expected to\
    \ be\n         used, and that other mechanisms will be constructed to provide\n\
    \         those functions.  Thus there should be no minimum\n         implementation,\
    \ but only the standard implementation which\n         includes the whole protocol.\n\
    \    Data Types:\n         The DATA TYPE signals are supposed to allow the communicating\n\
    \         processes to switch from ASCII to some other code set.  However,\n \
    \        the other code sets suggested do not allow for the Telnet\n         signals,\
    \ and thus once the switch is made the Telnet\n         protocol is no longer\
    \ applicable.  There is no way to specify\n         how to get back to ASCII or\
    \ Telnet thus the\n         conversation is \"out of control\".\n         process\
    \ to do whatever it can to hide the user's\n         subsequent input.  One problem\
    \ with this is determining\n         how much input is to be hidden.  It is very\
    \ difficult to find a\n         method of hiding input which works for all combinations\
    \ of\n         systems and terminals, but the HIDE YOUR INPUT signal dosen't\n\
    \         help in any real way.\n       [ This RFC was put into machine readable\
    \ form for entry ]\n       [ into the online RFC archives by BBN Corp. under the\
