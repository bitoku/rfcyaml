  title: Status of this Memo
- contents:
  - "Abstract\n   This document proposes a new sub-option to the DHCP (Dynamic Host\n
    \  Configuration Protocol) Relay Agent Information Option.  This new\n   sub-option
    is for use with DOCSIS (Data-Over-Cable Service Interface\n   Specifications)
    cable modems and describes a \"device class\" to which\n   the cable modem belongs.
    \ The cable modem signals its device class\n   information to the Relay Agent
    using DOCSIS signaling, and the Relay\n   Agent forwards the device class information
    to the DHCP Server which\n   can then make a policy decision based on it.\n"
  title: Abstract
- contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   The \"Relay Agent Information\" Option is described in [1]
    and includes\n   several Relay Agent Information sub-options.  This RFC proposes
    an\n   additional sub-option for use with DOCSIS cable modems.  This sub-\n   option
    is added by DHCP relay agents which terminate cable modems.\n   The sub-option
    encodes an identifier of the device class to which the\n   cable modem belongs.
    \ It is intended for use by DHCP servers to make\n   policy decisions based on
    the device class of the host.\n   The motivation for using a Relay Agent Information
    sub-option, rather\n   than a new or existing DHCP option, is the introduction
    of CPE\n   Controlled Cable Modems (CCCMs) [2].  In an implementation of a CCCM,\n
    \  the modem firmware controls DOCSIS signaling, but the attached\n   computer
    (CPE) manages other protocol activities -- particularly DHCP\n   client message
    handling.  The assumption of this document is that it\n   is better to trust the
    operation of the CCCM firmware, than to trust\n   the operation of CCCM software
    running on the attached computer\n   (e.g., a standard PC).\n   The key words
    \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", and \"MAY\"\n   in this document
    are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [4].\n"

  - "2.  DOCSIS Device Class Sub-option\n   The DOCSIS RFI specification [3] specifies
    the Device Class encoding\n   within the payload of the Device Class Identification
    Request (DCI-\n   REQ) message.  The relay agent MUST pass the Device Class value\n
    \  unchanged to the DHCP server.  Possible uses of this field include:\n      o
    \ host endpoint information\n      o  host hardware capabilities\n      o  host
    software capabilities\n      o  host options information\n   DOCSIS defines the
    Device Class to be a 32-bit field where individual\n   bits represent individual
    attributes of the CM.  Bit #0 is the least\n   significant bit of the field.  Bits
    are set to 1 to select the\n   attributes defined below.\n      bit #0 - CPE Controlled
    Cable Modem (CCCM)\n      bits #1-31 - Reserved and set to zero\n   The DOCSIS
    Device Class sub-option is coded as follows:\n       SubOpt   Len     Device Class\n
    \     +------+------+------+------+------+------+\n      |  4   |   4  |  d1  |
    \ d2  |  d3  |  d4  |\n      +------+------+------+------+------+------+\n   The
    DHCP server needs to understand the meaning of this sub-option in\n   order to
    offer different policy options in its reply to the host.\n   DHCP servers MAY
    use the device class for IP and other parameter\n   assignment policies for cable
    modems.\n"

  - "3.  Security Considerations\n   Operation of the DHCP Relay Agent Information
    Option relies on an\n   implied trusted relationship between the DHCP relay agent
    and the\n   DHCP server.  The discussion of security considerations for the DHCP\n
    \  relay agent information option [1] apply to this sub-option as well.\n   Operation
    of the DOCSIS Device Class sub-option relies on an implied\n   trusted relationship
    between the DHCP client (i.e., the cable modem)\n   and the DHCP relay agent,
    through DOCSIS signaling.  According to\n   DOCSIS specifications [2], the cable
    modem firmware always controls\n   DOCSIS signaling, but cannot control DHCP client
    message handling\n   (e.g., CCCMs).  This document assumes that the cable modem
    firmware\n   is trustworthy for DOCSIS signaling information.\n   This document
    introduces a new identifier, the DOCSIS Device Class\n   sub-option, that is provided
    by the relay agent device and is assumed\n   to be trusted.  Cryptographic or
    other techniques to authenticate the\n   device class are beyond the scope of
    this document.\n"
