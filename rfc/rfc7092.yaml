- title: Abstract
  contents:
  - "Abstract\n   In many SIP deployments, SIP entities exist in the SIP signaling\
    \ path\n   between the originating and final terminating endpoints, which go\n\
    \   beyond the definition of a SIP proxy, performing functions not\n   defined\
    \ in Standards Track RFCs.  The only term for such devices\n   provided in RFC\
    \ 3261 is for a Back-to-Back User Agent (B2BUA), which\n   is defined as the logical\
    \ concatenation of a SIP User Agent Server\n   (UAS) and User Agent Client (UAC).\n\
    \   There are numerous types of SIP B2BUAs performing different roles in\n   different\
    \ ways; for example, IP Private Branch Exchanges (IPBXs),\n   Session Border Controllers\
    \ (SBCs), and Application Servers (ASs).\n   This document identifies several\
    \ common B2BUA roles in order to\n   provide taxonomy other documents can use\
    \ and reference.\n"

- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   In current SIP deployments, there are numerous forms of\
    \ Back-to-Back\n   User Agents (B2BUAs), operating at various levels of transparency\
    \ and\n   for various purposes, with widely varying behavior from a SIP\n   perspective.\
    \  Some act as pure SIP proxies and only change to the\n   role of B2BUA in order\
    \ to generate BYEs to terminate dead sessions.\n   Some are full User Agent stacks\
    \ with only high-level event and\n   application logic binding the User Agent\
    \ Server (UAS) and User Agent\n   Client (UAC) sides.  Some B2BUAs operate only\
    \ in the SIP signaling\n   plane, while others participate in the media plane\
    \ as well.\n   As more SIP domains are deployed and interconnected, the probability\n\
    \   of a single SIP session crossing multiple B2BUAs at both the\n   signaling\
    \ and media planes increases significantly.\n   This document provides a taxonomy\
    \ of several common B2BUA roles so\n   that other documents may refer to them\
    \ using their given names\n   without redefining them in each document.\n"
- title: 2.  Terminology
  contents:
  - "2.  Terminology\n   The following terms are defined in [RFC3261], Section 6.\n\
    \   B2BUA:   a SIP Back-to-Back User Agent, which is the logical\n           \
    \ combination of a User Agent Server (UAS) and User Agent\n            Client\
    \ (UAC).\n   UAS:     a SIP User Agent Server.\n   UAC:     a SIP User Agent Client.\n"
- title: 3.  B2BUA Role Types
  contents:
  - "3.  B2BUA Role Types\n   Within the context of this document, the classification\
    \ refers to a\n   B2BUA role, not a particular system type.  A given system type\
    \ may\n   change its role in the middle of a SIP session, for example, when a\n\
    \   stateful proxy tears down a session by generating BYEs or when an SBC\n  \
    \ [RFC5853] performs transcoding or REFER termination.\n   Furthermore, this document\
    \ defines \"B2BUA\" following the definition\n   provided in [RFC3261], which\
    \ is the logical concatenation of a UAS\n   and UAC.  A typical centralized conference\
    \ server, for example, is\n   not a B2BUA because it is the target UAS of multiple\
    \ UACs, whereby\n   the UACs individually and independently initiate separate\
    \ SIP\n   sessions to the central conference server.  Likewise, a third-party\n\
    \   call control transcoder, as described in Section 3.1 of [RFC5369], is\n  \
    \ not a B2BUA, whereas an inline (conference bridge) transcoder based\n   on [RFC5370]\
    \ is a B2BUA.\n"
- title: 3.1.  Signaling Plane B2BUA Roles
  contents:
  - "3.1.  Signaling Plane B2BUA Roles\n   A signaling plane B2BUA is one that operates\
    \ only on the SIP message\n   protocol layer and only with SIP messages and headers\
    \ but not with\n   the media itself in any way.  This implies that it does not\
    \ modify\n   the Session Description Protocol (SDP) bodies, although it may save\n\
    \   them and/or operate on other MIME body types.  This category is\n   further\
    \ subdivided into specific roles as described in this section.\n   It should be\
    \ noted that there is a large variety of modifications\n   made by \"signaling\
    \ plane B2BUAs\".\n"
- title: 3.1.1.  Proxy-B2BUA
  contents:
  - "3.1.1.  Proxy-B2BUA\n   A Proxy-B2BUA is one that appears, from a SIP perspective,\
    \ to be a\n   SIP proxy based on [RFC3261] and its extensions, except that it\n\
    \   maintains a sufficient dialog state to generate in-dialog SIP\n   messages\
    \ on its own and does so in specific cases.  The most common\n   example of this\
    \ is a SIP proxy that can generate BYE requests to tear\n   down a dead session.\n\
    \   A Proxy-B2BUA does not modify the received header fields such as To,\n   From,\
    \ or Contact, and it only modifies the Via and Record-Route\n   header fields\
    \ following the rules in [RFC3261] and its extensions.\n   If a Proxy-B2BUA can\
    \ generate in-dialog messages, then it will also\n   need to modify the CSeq header\
    \ after it has generated its own.  A\n   Proxy-B2BUA neither modifies nor inspects\
    \ MIME bodies (including\n   SDP), does not have any awareness of media, will\
    \ forward any method\n   type, etc.\n"
- title: 3.1.2.  Signaling-only
  contents:
  - "3.1.2.  Signaling-only\n   A Signaling-only B2BUA is one that operates at the\
    \ SIP layer but in\n   ways beyond those of [RFC3261] proxies, even for normally\
    \ forwarded\n   requests.  For example, such a B2BUA might replace the Contact\
    \ URI,\n   modify or remove all Via and Record-Route headers, modify the To and\n\
    \   From header fields, modify or inspect specific MIME bodies, etc.  No\n   SIP\
    \ header field is guaranteed to be copied from the received request\n   on the\
    \ UAS side to the generated request on the UAC side.\n   An example of such a\
    \ B2BUA would be some form of an Application\n   Server and a PBX, such as a server\
    \ that locally processes REFER\n   requests and generates new INVITEs on behalf\
    \ of the REFER's target.\n   Another example would be a privacy service proxy\
    \ [RFC3323] performing\n   the 'header' privacy function.\n"
- title: 3.1.3.  SDP-Modifying Signaling-only
  contents:
  - "3.1.3.  SDP-Modifying Signaling-only\n   An SDP-Modifying Signaling-only B2BUA\
    \ is one that operates in the\n   signaling plane only and is not in the media\
    \ path, but it does modify\n   SDP bodies and is thus aware of and understands\
    \ SDP syntax and\n   semantics.  In some cases, some Application Servers and PBXs\
    \ act in\n   this role, for example, to remove certain codec choices or merge\
    \ two\n   media endpoints into one SDP offer.\n   These B2BUAs don't do anything\
    \ that changes the path that the media\n   takes (in particular, they don't insert\
    \ themselves on the media\n   path), but they may make SDP changes that affect\
    \ what is sent on the\n   media plane.\n"
- title: 3.2.  Signaling/Media Plane B2BUA Roles
  contents:
  - "3.2.  Signaling/Media Plane B2BUA Roles\n   A signaling/media plane B2BUA is\
    \ one that operates at both the SIP\n   and media planes and not only on SIP messages\
    \ but also on SDP and\n   potentially the Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) /\
    \ the Real-Time\n   Control Protocol (RTCP) [RFC3550] or other media.  Such a\
    \ B2BUA may\n   or may not replace the Contact URI, modify or remove all Via and\n\
    \   Record-Route headers, modify the To and From header fields, etc.  No\n   SIP\
    \ header field is guaranteed to be copied from the received request\n   on the\
    \ UAS side to the generated request on the UAC side, and SDP\n   will also be\
    \ modified.\n   An example of such a B2BUA would be a Session Border Controller\
    \ (SBC)\n   performing the functions defined in [RFC5853], a B2BUA transcoder\
    \ as\n   defined in [RFC5370], a rich-ringtone Application Server, or a\n   recording\
    \ system.  Another example would be a privacy service proxy\n   [RFC3323] performing\
    \ the 'session' privacy function.\n   Note that a signaling/media plane B2BUA\
    \ need not be instantiated in a\n   single physical system, but it may be decomposed\
    \ into separate\n   signaling and media functions.\n   The signaling/media plane\
    \ B2BUA category is further subdivided into\n   specific roles as described in\
    \ this section.\n"
- title: 3.2.1.  Media Relay
  contents:
  - "3.2.1.  Media Relay\n   A B2BUA that performs a media-relay role is one that\
    \ terminates the\n   media plane at the IP and transport (UDP/TCP) layers on its\
    \ UAS and\n   UAC sides, but neither modifies nor restricts which forms of payload\n\
    \   are carried within the packets.  Rather, the payload is transparently\n  \
    \ copied from one side to the other.  Such a role may or may not\n   support only\
    \ UDP, only TCP, both UDP and TCP, as well as other\n   transport types.  It may\
    \ also involve policing the IP packets to fit\n   within a bandwidth limit or\
    \ converting from IPv4 to IPv6, or vice\n   versa.  This is typically similar\
    \ to NAT behavior, except a NAT\n   operating in both directions on both the source\
    \ and destination\n   information; it is often found as the default behavior in\
    \ SBCs.\n"
- title: 3.2.2.  Media Aware
  contents:
  - "3.2.2.  Media Aware\n   A B2BUA that performs a media-aware role is similar to\
    \ a media relay\n   except that it inspects and potentially modifies the payload\
    \ carried\n   in UDP or TCP (as it could be RTP or RTCP [RFC3550]), but it does\
    \ not\n   at a codec or higher layer.  An example of such a role is a Secure\n\
    \   Real-time Transport Protocol (SRTP) [RFC3711] terminator, which does\n   not\
    \ need to care about the RTP payload but does care about the RTP\n   header; or,\
    \ a device that monitors RTCP for QoS information; or, a\n   device that multiplexes/demultiplexes\
    \ RTP and RTCP packets on the\n   same 5-tuple.\n"
- title: 3.2.3.  Media Termination
  contents:
  - "3.2.3.  Media Termination\n   A B2BUA that performs a media-termination role\
    \ is one that operates\n   at the media payload layer, such as RTP/RTCP codec\
    \ or the Message\n   Session Relay Protocol (MSRP) message layer and higher. \
    \ Such a role\n   may only terminate/generate specific RTP media, such as dual-tone\n\
    \   multi-frequency (DTMF) packets [RFC4733], or it may convert between\n   media\
    \ codecs or act as a Back-to-Back MSRP [RFC4975] agent.  This is\n   the role\
    \ performed by transcoders, conference servers based on\n   [RFC5366], etc.\n"

    \ previously do not define system\n   types, as discussed in Section 3, some discussion\

- title: 4.4.  Transcoders
  contents:
  - "4.4.  Transcoders\n   Transcoders perform the function of transcoding one audio\

    \   media in specific cases of codec mismatch between the two ends.\n   Although\
    \ [RFC5369] and [RFC5370] define two types of SIP transcoders,\n   in practice,\
    \ a popular variant of the inline conference bridge model\n   [RFC5370] is to\
    \ behave as a SIP B2BUA without using the resource-list\n   mechanism but rather\
    \ simply routing a normal INVITE request through a\n   B2BUA with a built-in transcoder.\
    \  SIP transcoder architectures are\n   based on everything from SIP media servers\

- title: 5.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "5.  Security Considerations\n   Security risks are specific to each type of B2BUA,\
    \ so little can be\n   said in general.  Of course, adding extra systems in the\n\
    \   communication path creates extra points of attack, reduces or\n   eliminates\
    \ the ability to perform end-to-end encryption, decreases\n   the privacy of SIP\
    \ communications, and complicates trust models.\n   Thus, every B2BUA design requires\
    \ particular attention to security\n   analysis.\n   A few general points can\
    \ be made:\n   1.  The B2BUA processing of SDP and media packets is an impediment\
    \ to\n       the deployment of end-to-end SRTP and reduces the ability to\n  \
    \     deploy new, stronger forms of SRTP key exchange.\n   2.  The ability for\
    \ B2BUAs to modify any SIP header field value and\n       body impacts the ability\
    \ to deploy SIP identity and message\n       integrity.\n   3.  The management\
    \ and configuration mechanisms of B2BUAs are a\n       tempting point of attack\
    \ and must be strongly defended.\n   Further security considerations related to\
    \ the functionality\n   described in this document are addressed in the relevant\
    \ references.\n"
