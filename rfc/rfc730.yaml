    \ the need for and advantages of the expression of\naddresses in a network environment\
    \ as a set of fields.  The suggestion\nis that as the network grows the address\
    \ can be extended by three\ntechniques: adding fields on the left, adding fields\
    \ on the right, and\nincreasing the size of individual fields.  Carl Sunshine\
    \ has described\nthis type of addressing in a paper on source routing [1].\nMotivation\n\
    Change in the Host-IMP Interface\nThe revised Host-IMP interface provides for\
    \ a larger address space for\nhosts and IMPs [2].  The old inteface allowed for\
    \ a 2 bit host field and\na 6 bit IMP field.  The new interface allows a 8 bit\
    \ host field and a 16\nbit IMP field.  In using the old interface it was common\
    \ practice to\ntreat the two fields as a single eight bit quantity.  When it was\n\
    necessary to refer to a host by number a decimal number was often used.\nFor example\
    \ host 1 on IMP 1 was called host 65. Doug Wells has pointed\nout some of problems\
    \ associated with attempting to continue such useage\nas the new interface comes\
    \ into use [3].  If a per field notation had\nbeen used no problems would arise.\n\
    Some examples of old and new host numbers are:\n  Host Name       Host IMP old\
    \ #   new #\n  SRI-ARC            0   2     2       2\n  UCLA-CCN           1\

    \ Systems\nThe prospect of interconnections of networks to form a complex\nmultinetwork\
    \ system poses additional addressing problems.  The new\nHost-IMP interface specification\
    \ has reserved fields in the leader to\nPostel                               \
    \                           [page 1]\fExtensible Field Addressing\ncarry network\
    \ addresses  [2].  There is experimental work in progress on\ninterconnecting\
    \ networks [4, 5, 6]. We should be prepared for these\nextensions to the address\
    \ space.\nThe addressing scheme should be expandable to increase in scope when\n\
    interconnections are made between complex systems.\nMultiprocessor Hosts\nThere\
    \ may be configurations of hardware that could be interfaced to a\nnetwork as\
    \ a single host that in fact contain multiple processors.\nTasks could be associated\
    \ with processors such that it is desirable to\ndispatch network messages associated\
    \ with certain sockets or message-ids\nto certain processors.  For example it\
    \ might be desirable to service all\nTelnet use from one processor and all FTP\
    \ use from a different\nprocessor.\nThe addressing scheme should be expandable\
    \ to explicitly address the\nfine structure within a host when that is desirable.\n\
    Some examples where such fine structure addressing would have been\nuseful in\
    \ the ARPANET are:\n  At ISI, we have the capability of emulating computers using\
    \ the PRIM\n  system [7].  For many applications it is desirable to add the emulated\n\
    \  host to the network.  Since the emulation is carried out under control\n  of\
    \ a program operating under Tenex, we have a host within a host.\n  Extensible\
    \ addressing of hosts would provide the necessary handle.\n  SCRL once had a PDP-11\
    \ connected by VDH to an IMP at UCSB.  It became\n  necessary to add a second\
    \ PDP-11 to the network.  The two PDP-11s were\n  already physically connected\
    \ and it would have been a simple matter to\n  have the first serve as a multiplexor\
    \ for both.  However, because of\n  the limitations in the network addressing\
    \ structure, there was no way\n  to identify the two hosts to other sites on the\
    \ network.  A new IMP\n  had to be installed!\n  In many other cases, it is desirable\
    \ to have two hosts share the same\n  front end to the network.  With the current\
    \ limitation, one IMP port\n  must be consumed for each host.\nPostel        \
    \                                                  [page 2]\fExtensible Field\
    \ Addressing\nProposal\nThe necessary solution to the problem posed by the change\
    \ in the\nHost-IMP inteface is to always represent the address by fields.  This\n\
    solution provides for a natural growth into an internetwork environment,\nand\
    \ allows explicit addressing of the fine structure within a host if\nthat is desirable.\n\
    The fields should be written in a natural way, and i believe that means\nthat\
    \ the most general field should come first with additional fields\nspecifying\
    \ more and more details of the address.  In the current case\nthis would lead\
    \ to the following fields:\nNetwork / IMP / Host / Message-Identifier\nA problem\
    \ with simple field addressing is the desire to specify only the\nfields that\
    \ are necessary given the local context.  A program\ninterpreting the address\
    \ is then unsure what the first field represents.\nSome clues are needed in the\
    \ address specification for correct parsing\nto be possible.  Dave Crocker has\
    \ described a syntax for a similar\nproblem in network access of data [8].\nSpecific\
    \ Sugestion\nSpecifically i suggest that we adopt a field based extensible address\n\
    scheme where each field is separated from its neighbors by a delimiter\ncharacter\
    \ and each field has a name.  When an address is specified the\nname of the most\
    \ general field must also be indicated.\n  Definitions:\n    <address> ::= <field-name>\
    \ \":\" <fields>\n    <field-name> ::= \"NET\" | \"IMP\" | \"HOST\" | \"MESSAGE-ID\"\
    \n    <fields> ::= <field> | <field> \"/\" <fields>\n    <field> ::= a decimal\
    \ number\n  Examples:\n    NET:1/3/5/7  names message-id 7 at host 5 on imp 3\
    \ in network 1.\n    HOST:6  names host 6 on whatever imp this message originates\
    \ on.\nPostel                                                          [page 3]\f\
    Extensible Field Addressing\nOne might ask:  What is all the fuss about, isn't\
    \ this a non-problem?,\nThe answer is:  Almost.  There are very few places where\
    \ any real\ndifficulties arise, but we have to change the way we think about host\n\
    addresses.  The places where there is a problem are typically little\nused, except\
    \ one.  The place where humans will see a difficulty is in\nthe TIP \"open\" command\
    \ [9], and to a lesser extent the user Telnet and\nuser FTP \"connect\" commands.\
    \  Other places are in the MAIL netaddress\nfield, the FTP \"sock\" command [10],\
    \ the Telnet reconnection option [11],\nand in the NIC maintained list of official\
    \ host names [12].\nConclusion\nThe suggestion is that we adopt field based extensible\
    \ addressing to\nprovide for growth in three ways:\n(1)  growth of the number\
    \ of hosts and IMPs by allowing these fields to\ngrow in size independently of\
    \ each other;\n(2)  growth in scope by the addition of fields on the left to provide\n\
    for multinetwork systems;\n(3)  growth in fine structure by addition of fields\
    \ on the right for the\nimplementation of hosts as mininetworks.\nPostel     \
