- title: 1.1 New URL schemes
  contents:
  - "1.1 New URL schemes\n   This specification defines three new URL schemes: \"\
    tel\", \"fax\" and\n   \"modem\". They are intended for describing a terminal\
    \ that can be\n   contacted using the telephone network. The description includes\
    \ the\n   subscriber (telephone) number of the terminal and the necessary\n  \
    \ parameters to be able to successfully connect to that terminal.\n   The \"tel\"\
    \ scheme describes a connection to a terminal that handles\n   normal voice telephone\
    \ calls, a voice mailbox or another voice\n   messaging system or a service that\
    \ can be operated using DTMF tones.\n   The \"fax\" scheme describes a connection\
    \ to a terminal that can handle\n   telefaxes (facsimiles). The name (scheme specifier)\
    \ for the URL is\n   \"fax\" as recommended by [E.123].\n   The \"modem\" scheme\
    \ describes a connection to a terminal that can\n   handle incoming data calls.\
    \ The term \"modem\" refers to a device that\n   does digital-to-analog and analog-to-digital\
    \ conversions; in addition\n   to these, a \"modem\" scheme can describe a fully\
    \ digital connection.\n   The notation for phone numbers is the same which is\
    \ specified in\n   [RFC2303] and [RFC2304]. However, the syntax definition is\
    \ a bit\n   different due to the fact that this document specifies URLs whereas\n\
    \   [RFC2303] and [RFC2304] specify electronic mail addresses. For\n   example,\
    \ \"/\" (used in URLs to separate parts in a hierarchical URL\n   [RFC2396]) has\
    \ been replaced by \";\". In addition, this URL scheme has\n   been synchronized\
    \ with [RFC2543].\n   When these URLs are used, the number of parameters should\
    \ be kept to\n   the minimum, unless this would make the context of use unclear.\n\
    \   Having a short URL is especially important if the URL is intended to\n   be\
    \ shown to the end user, printed, or otherwise distributed so that\n   it is visible.\n"
- title: 1.2 Formal definitions
  contents:
  - "1.2 Formal definitions\n   The ABNF (augmented Backus-Naur form) notation used\
    \ in formal\n   definitions follows [RFC2234]. This specification uses elements\
    \ from\n   the 'core' definitions (Appendix A of [RFC2234]). Some elements have\n\
    \   been defined in previous RFCs. If this is the case, the RFC in\n   question\
    \ has been referenced in comments.\n   Note on non-unreserved characters [RFC2396]\
    \ in URLs: the ABNF in this\n   document specifies strings of raw, unescaped characters.\
    \ If those\n   characters are present in a URL, and are not unreserved [RFC2396],\n\
    \   they MUST be escaped as explained in [RFC2396] prior to using the\n   URL.\
    \  In addition, when parsing a URL, it must be noted that some\n   characters\
    \ may have been escaped.\n   An example: ABNF notation \"%x20\" means a single\
    \ octet with a\n   hexadecimal value of \"20\" (in US-ASCII, a space character).\
    \ This must\n   be escaped in a URL, and it becomes \"%20\".\n   In addition,\
    \ the ABNF in this document only uses lower case. The URLs\n   are case-insensitive\
    \ (except for the <future-extension> parameter,\n   whose case-sensitivity is\
    \ application-specific).\n"
- title: 1.3 Requirements
  contents:
  - "1.3 Requirements\n   The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\"\
    , \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and\
    \ \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].\n\
    \   Compliant software MUST follow this specification.\n"

- title: 2.1 Applicability
  contents:
  - "2.1 Applicability\n   In this document, \"local entity\" means software and hardware\
    \ that can\n   detect and parse one or more of these URLs and possibly place a\
    \ call\n   to a remote entity, or otherwise utilize the contents of the URL.\n\
    \   These URL schemes are used to direct the local entity to place a call\n  \
    \ using the telephone network, or as a method to transfer or store a\n   phone\
    \ number plus other relevant data. The network in question may be\n   a landline\
    \ or mobile phone network, or a combination of these. If the\n   phone network\
    \ differentiates between (for example) voice and data\n   calls, or if the local\
    \ entity has several different\n   telecommunications equipment at its disposal,\
    \ it is possible to\n   specify which kind of call (voice/fax/data) is requested.\
    \ The URL can\n   also contain information about the capabilities of the remote\
    \ entity,\n   so that the connection can be established successfully.\n   The\
    \ \"tel\", \"fax\" and \"modem\" URL schemes defined here do not use the\n   hierarchical\
    \ URL syntax; there are no applicable relative URL forms.\n   The URLs are always\
    \ case-insensitive, except for the <future-\n   extension> parameter (see below),\
    \ whose case-sensitivity is\n   application specific. Characters in the URL MUST\
    \ be escaped when\n   needed as explained in [RFC2396].\n"

    \ URL starts with <telephone-scheme>, which tells the local entity\n   that what\
    \ follows is a URL that should be parsed as described in this\n   document. After\
    \ that, the URL contains the phone number of the remote\n   entity. Phone numbers\
    \ can also contain subaddresses, which are used\n   to identify different remote\
    \ entities under the same phone number. If\n   a subaddress is present, it is\
    \ appended to the phone number after\n   \";isub=\". Phone numbers can also contain\
    \ a post-dial sequence. This\n   is what is often used with voice mailboxes and\
    \ other services that\n   are controlled by dialing numbers from your phone keypad\
    \ while the\n   call is in progress. The <post-dial> sequence describes what and\
    \ when\n   the local entity should send to the phone line.\n   Phone numbers can\
    \ be either \"global\" or \"local\". Global numbers are\n   unambiguous everywhere.\
    \ Local numbers are usable only within a\n   certain area, which is called \"\
    context\", see section 2.5.2.\n   Local numbers always have an <area-specifier>,\
    \ which specifies the\n   context in which the number is usable (the same number\
    \ may have\n   different interpretation in different network areas). The context\
    \ can\n   be indicated with three different prefixes. A <global-network-prefix>\n\
    \   indicates that the number is valid within a numbering area whose\n   global\
    \ numbers start with <global-network-prefix>. Similarly,\n   <local-network-prefix>\
    \ means that the number is valid within a\n   numbering area whose numbers (or\
    \ dial strings) start with it. A\n   <private-prefix> is a name of a context.\
    \ The local entity must have\n   knowledge of this private context to be able\
    \ to deduce whether it can\n   use the number, see section 2.5.2. Additional information\
    \ about the\n   phone number's usage can be included by adding the name of the\n\
    \   telephony services provider in <service-provider>, see section\n   2.5.10.\n\
    \   The <future-extension> mechanism makes it possible to add new\n   parameters\
    \ to this URL scheme. See section 2.5.11.\n   The <private-prefix>, <token-char>\
    \ and <quoted-string> nonterminals\n   may seem a bit complex at first, but they\

    \ be written in the\n   international form if there is no good reason to use the\
    \ local form.\n   Not all numbers are valid within all numbering areas. The <area-\n\
    \   specifier> parameter, which is mandatory for local numbers, is used\n   to\
    \ indicate the locale within which this number is valid, or to\n   qualify the\
    \ phone number so that it may be used unambiguously. The\n   <area-specifier>\
    \ can take three forms: <global-network-prefix>,\n   <local-network-prefix> or\
    \ <private-prefix>. These are used to\n   describe the validity area of the phone\
    \ number either in global\n   numbering plan, local numbering plan, or in a private\
    \ numbering plan,\n   respectively.\n   If <area-specifier> is present, the local\
    \ entity MUST NOT attempt to\n   call out using the phone number if it cannot\
    \ originate the call\n   within the specified locale. If a <local-phone-number>\
    \ is used, an\n   <area-specifier> MUST be included as well.\n   There can be\
    \ multiple instances of <area-specifier>. In this case,\n   the number is valid\
    \ in all of the given numbering areas.\n   The global prefix form is intended\
    \ to act as the outermost context\n   for a phone number, so it will start with\
    \ a \"+\", followed by some\n   part of an E.164 number. It also specifies the\
    \ region in which the\n   phone number is valid. For example, if <global-network-prefix>\
    \ is\n   \"+358\", the given number is valid only within Finland (country code\n\
    \   358) - even if it is a <global-phone-number>.\n   The local prefix form is\
    \ intended to act as an intermediate context\n   in those situations where the\
    \ outermost context for a phone number is\n   given by another means. One example\
    \ of use is where the local entity\n   is known to originate calls only within\
    \ the North American Number\n   Plan Area, so an \"outermost\" phone context can\
    \ be assumed. The local\n   context could, for example, be used to indicate the\
    \ area code within\n   which an associated phone number is situated. Thus \"tel:456-\n\
    \   7890;phone-context=213\" would suffice to deliver a call to the\n   telephone\
    \ number \"+1-213-456-7890\". Note that the version including\n   the <phone-context>\
    \ implies further that the call can only be\n   originated within the \"area code\
    \ 213\" region.\n   The <private-prefix> form is intended for use in those situations\n\
    \   where the context cannot be expressed with a start of a global phone\n   number\
    \ or a dialing string. The <private-prefix> is actually a name\n   of a private\
    \ context. The creator of the URL and the local entity\n   have been configured\
    \ to recognize this name, and as such they can\n   interpret the number and know\
    \ how they can utilize the number. For\n   example, a private network numbering\
    \ plan may be indicated by the\n   name \"X-COMPANY-NET\", but the private dialling\
    \ plan from the locales\n   of the sender of the telephony URL and the local entity\
    \ are\n   different. The syntax of these tokens will be left for future\n   specification.\
    \ The ABNF above specifies the accepted characters that\n   can be a part of <private-prefix>.\n\
    \   Unless the sender is absolutely sure that they share the same private\n  \
    \ network access digit string with the local entity, then they MUST NOT\n   use\
    \ a dialling plan number (a local phone number, or one qualified by\n   a local\
    \ context), as the result may be incorrect. Instead, they\n   SHOULD use a global\
    \ number, or if that is not possible, a private\n   context as the last resort.\
    \ If the local entity does not support\n   dialling into the private network indicated\
    \ by that context, then the\n   request MUST be rejected. If it does, then it\
    \ will use the access\n   digit string appropriate for its locale.\n   Note that\
    \ the use of <area-specifier> is orthogonal to use of the\n   telephony service\
    \ provider parameter (see 2.5.10); it qualifies the\n   phone number, whilst the\
    \ <service-provider> parameter indicates the\n   carrier to be used for the call\
    \ attempt.\n   For example, a large company may have private network\n   interconnections\
    \ between its sites, as well as connections to the\n   Global Switched Telephone\
    \ Network. A phone number may be given in\n   \"public network\" form, but with\
    \ a <service-provider> indicating that\n   the call should be carried over the\
    \ corporate network.\n   Conversely, it would be possible to represent a phone\
    \ number in\n   private network form, with a private context to indicate this,\
    \ but\n   indicate a public telephony service provider. This would request that\n\
    \   the user agent convert the private network number plan address into a\n  \
    \ form that can be carried using the selected service provider.\n   Any telephone\
    \ number MUST contain at least one <phonedigit> or\n   <dtmf-digit>, that is,\
    \ subscriber numbers consisting only of pause\n   characters are not allowed.\n\
    \   International numbers MUST begin with the \"+\" character. Local\n   numbers\
    \ MUST NOT contain that character. International numbers MUST\n   be written with\
    \ the country (CC) and national (NSN) numbers as\n   specified in [E.123] and\
    \ [E.164]. International numbers have the\n   property of being totally unambiguous\
    \ everywhere in the world if the\n   local entity is properly configured.\n  \
    \ Local numbers MAY be used if the number only works from inside a\n   certain\
    \ geographical area or a network. Note that some numbers may\n   work from several\
    \ networks but not from the whole world - these\n   SHOULD be written in international\
    \ form, with a set of <area-\n   specifier> tags and optional <service-provider>\
    \ parameters. URLs\n   containing local phone numbers should only appear in an\
    \ environment\n   where all local entities can get the call successfully set up\
    \ by\n   passing the number to the dialing entity \"as is\". An example could\
    \ be\n   a company intranet, where all local entities are located under a the\n\
    \   same private telephone exchange. If local phone numbers are used,\n   the\
    \ document in which they are present SHOULD contain an indication\n   of the context\
    \ in which they are intended to be used, and an\n   appropriate <area-specifier>\
    \ SHOULD be present in the URL.\n   In some regions, it is popular to write phone\
    \ numbers using\n   alphabetic characters which correspond to certain numbers\
    \ on the\n   telephone keypad.  Letters in <dtmf-digit> characters do not have\n\
    \   anything to do with this, nor is this method supported by these URL\n   schemes.\n\
    \   It should also be noted that implementations MUST NOT assume that\n   telephone\
    \ numbers have a maximum, minimum or fixed length, or that\n   they would always\
    \ begin with a certain number.  Implementors are\n   encouraged to familiarize\
    \ themselves with the international\n   standards.\n"

- title: 2.7.3 Why to use E.164-style numbering?
  contents:
  - "2.7.3 Why to use E.164-style numbering?\n   E.164 refers to international telephone\
    \ numbers, and the string of\n   digits after the country code is usually a national\
    \ matter. In any\n   case, phone numbers are usually written as a simple string\
    \ of numbers\n   everywhere. Because of this, the syntax in this specification\
    \ is\n   intuitively clear to most people. This is the usual way to write\n  \
    \ phone numbers in business cards, advertisements, telephone books and\n   so\
    \ on.\n   It should be noted that phone numbers may have 'hierarchical'\n   characteristics,\
    \ so that one could build a 'forest' of phone numbers\n   with country codes as\
    \ roots, area codes as branches and subscriber\n   numbers as leaves. However,\
    \ this is not always the case. Not all\n   areas have area codes; some areas may\
    \ have different area codes\n   depending on how one wants to route the call;\
    \ some numbers must\n   always be dialled \"as is\", without prepending area or\
    \ country codes\n   (notably emergency numbers); and area codes can and do change.\n\
    \   Usually, if something has a hierarchical structure, the URL syntax\n   should\
    \ reflect that fact. These URLs are an exception.\n   Also, when writing the phone\
    \ number in the form described in this\n   specification, the writer does not\
    \ need to know which part of the\n   number is the country code and which part\
    \ is the area code. If a\n   hierarchical URL would be used (with a \"/\" character\
    \ separating the\n   parts of the phone numbers), the writer of the URL would\
    \ have to know\n   which parts are which.\n   Finally, when phone numbers are\
    \ written in the international form as\n   specified here, they are unambiguous\
    \ and can always be converted to\n   the local dialing convention, given that\
    \ the user agent has the\n   knowledge of the local country and area codes.\n"
- title: 2.7.4 Not everyone has the same equipment as you
  contents:
  - "2.7.4 Not everyone has the same equipment as you\n   There are several ways for\
    \ the subscriber to dial a phone number:\n     - By pulse dialing. Typically old\
    \ telephone exchanges. Usually this\n     dialing method has only to be used to\
    \ set up the call; after\n     connecting to the remote entity, <post-dial> can\
    \ be sent to the\n     line using DTMF, because it will typically be processed\
    \ by the\n     remote entity, not the telephone network.\n     - By DTMF. These\
    \ are the 'beeps' that you hear when you dial on\n     most phones.\n     - By\
    \ direct network signalling. ISDN subscribers and mobile phone\n     users usually\
    \ have this. There is no dial tone (or if there is, it\n     is generated locally\
    \ by the equipment), and the number of the\n     called party is communicated\
    \ to the telephone network using some\n     network signalling method. After setting\
    \ up the call, <post-dial>\n     sequences are usually sent using DTMF codes.\n"
- title: 2.7.5 Do not confuse numbers with how they are dialled
  contents:
  - "2.7.5 Do not confuse numbers with how they are dialled\n   As an example, +123456789\
    \ will be dialled in many countries as\n   00123456789, where the leading \"00\"\
    \ is a prefix for international\n   calls. However, if a URL contains a local\
    \ phone number 00123456789,\n   the user-agent MUST NOT assume that this number\
    \ is equal to a global\n   phone number +123456789. If a user-agent received a\
    \ telephony URL\n   with a local number in it, it MUST make sure that it knows\
    \ the\n   context in which the local phone number is to be processed, or else\n\
    \   the number MUST NOT be used. Equally, anyone sending a telephony URL\n   MUST\
    \ take into consideration that the recipient may have insufficient\n   information\
    \ about the phone number's context.\n"
- title: 3. Comments on usage
  contents:
  - "3. Comments on usage\n   These are examples of the recommended usage of this\
    \ URL in HTML\n   documents.\n   First of all, the number SHOULD be visible to\
    \ the end user, if it is\n   conceivable that the user might not have a local\
    \ entity which is able\n   to use these URLs.\n     Telephone: <a href=\"tel:+3585551234567\"\
    >+358-555-1234567</a>\n   Second, on a public HTML page, the telephone number\
    \ in the URL SHOULD\n   always be in the international form, even if the text\
    \ of the link\n   uses some local format.\n     Telephone: <a href=\"tel:+3585551234567\"\
    >(0555) 1234567</a>\n   or even\n     For more info, call <a href=\"tel:+15554383785965\"\
    >1-555-IETF-RULZ-\n     OK</a>.\n   Moreover, if the number is a <local-phone-number>,\
    \ and the scope of\n   the number is not clear from the context in which the URL\
    \ is\n   displayed, a human-readable explanation SHOULD be included.\n     For\
    \ customer service, dial <a href=\"tel:1234;phone-\n     context=+358555\">1234</a>\
    \ (only from Terrific Telecom mobile\n     phones).\n"

- title: 5. Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "5. Security Considerations\n   It should be noted that the local entity SHOULD\
    \ NOT call out without\n   the knowledge of the user because of associated risks,\
    \ which include\n   - call costs (including long calls, long distance calls,\n\
    \     international calls and premium rate calls, or calls which do not\n    \
    \ terminate due to <post-dial> sequences that have been left out by\n     the\
    \ local entity)\n   - wrong numbers inserted on web pages by malicious users,\
    \ or sent via\n     e-mail, perhaps in direct advertising\n   - making the user's\
    \ phone line unavailable (off-hook) for a malicious\n     purpose\n   - opening\
    \ a data call to a remote host, thus possibly opening a back\n     door to the\
    \ user's computer\n   - revealing the user's (possibly unlisted) phone number\
    \ to the remote\n     host in the caller identification data, and correlating\
    \ the local\n     entity's phone number with other information such as the e-mail\

    \ in which the\n     number may have a different meaning\n   All of these risks\
    \ MUST be taken into consideration when designing\n   the local entity.\n   The\
    \ local entity SHOULD have some mechanism that the user can use to\n   filter\
    \ out unwanted numbers. The local entity SHOULD NOT use rapid\n   redialing of\
    \ the number if it is busy to avoid the congestion of the\n   (signaling) network.\
    \ Also, the local entity SHOULD detect if the\n   number is unavailable or if\
    \ the call is terminated before the dialing\n   string has been completely processed\
    \ (for example, the call is\n   terminated while waiting for user input) and not\
    \ try to call again,\n   unless instructed by the user.\n"
