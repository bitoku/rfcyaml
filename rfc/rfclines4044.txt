This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB) for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
In particular, it describes managed objects for information related to the Fibre Channel.
The Internet Standard Management Framework
For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current Internet Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of RFC 3410 [RFC3410].
Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed the Management Information Base or MIB.
MIB objects are generally accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the Structure of Management Information (SMI).
This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58, RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58
, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
Short Overview of the Fibre Channel
The Fibre Channel (FC) is logically a bidirectional point to point serial data channel, structured for high performance capability.
The Fibre Channel provides a general transport vehicle for higher level protocols such as Intelligent Peripheral Interface (IPI) and Small Computer System Interface (SCSI)
command sets, the High Performance Parallel Interface (HIPPI) data framing, IP (Internet Protocol), IEEE 802.2, and others.
Physically, the Fibre Channel is an interconnection of multiple communication points, called N Ports, interconnected either by a switching network, called a Fabric, or by a point to point link.
A Fibre Channel "node" consists of one or more N Ports.
A Fabric may consist of multiple Interconnect Elements, some of which are switches.
An N Port connects to the Fabric via a port on a switch called an F Port.
When multiple FC nodes are connected to a single port on a switch via an "Arbitrated Loop" topology, the switch port is called an FL Port, and the nodes' ports are called NL Ports.
Nx Port refers to either an N Port or an NL port.
Fx Port refers to either an F Port or an FL port.
A switch port, which is interconnected to another switch port via an Inter Element Link (IEL), is called an E Port.
A B Port connects a bridge device with an E Port on a switch; a B Port provides a subset of E Port functionality.
Many Fibre Channel components, including the fabric, each node, and most ports, have globally unique names.
These globally unique names are typically formatted as World Wide Names (WWNs).
More information on WWNs can be found in [WWN1] and [WWN2].
WWNs are expected to be persistent across agent and unit resets.
Fibre Channel frames contain 24 bit address identifiers that identify the frame's source and destination ports.
Each FC port has an address identifier and a WWN.
When a fabric is in use, the FC address identifiers are dynamic and are assigned by a switch.
This MIB contains the notion of a Fibre Channel management instance, which is defined as a separable managed instance of Fibre Channel functionality.
Fibre Channel functionality may be grouped into Fibre Channel management instances in whatever way is most convenient for the implementation(s).
For example, one such grouping accommodates a single SNMP agent having multiple AgentX
[RFC2741] sub agents, with each sub agent implementing a different Fibre Channel management instance.
To represent such multiple Fibre Channel management instances within the same SNMP context (see section 3.3.1 of [RFC3411]), all tables in this MIB are INDEX ed by fcmInstanceIndex, which is defined as an arbitrary integer to uniquely identify a particular Fibre Channel management instance.
This MIB contains eleven MIB groups, as follows.
This group contains basic information about a Fibre Channel managed instance, including its name and description, the Fibre Channel function(s)
it performs, and optional pointers to hardware and/or software components.
This group contains basic information about a Fibre Channel switch, including its domain
whether it is the principal switch of its fabric.
This group contains basic information about a Fibre Channel port, including its port name (WWN), the name of the node (if any) of which it is a part, the type of port, the classes of service it supports, its transmitter and connector types, and the higher level protocols it supports.
Each Fibre Channel port is represented by an entry in the ifTable (see below).
The tables relating to ports in this MIB are indexed by the port's value of ifIndex.
This group contains traffic statistics, which are not specific to any particular class of service, for Fibre Channel ports.
This group contains traffic statistics that are specific to Class 2 or Class 3 traffic on Fibre Channel ports, including class specific frame and octet counters and counters of busy and reject frames.
The fcmPortLcStatsGroup Group Some of the statistics in the fcmPortClass23StatsGroup can increase rapidly enough to warrant them being defined using the Counter64 syntax.
However, some old SNMP systems do not (yet) support Counter64 objects.
Thus, this group defines low capacity (Counter32 based)
equivalents for the Counter64 based statistics in the fcmPortClass23StatsGroup group.
This group contains traffic statistics that are specific to Class F traffic on the E Ports of a Fibre Channel switch.
This group contains counters of various error conditions that can occur on Fibre Channel ports.
This group contains information about ports on a Fibre Channel switch.
For an Fx Port, it includes the port's timeout values, its hold time, and its capabilities in terms of maximum and minimum buffer to buffer credit allocations, maximum and minimum data field sizes, and support for class 2 and class 3 sequenced delivery.
For an E Port or B Port, it includes the buffer to buffer credit allocation and data field size.
This group contains information, known to a Fibre Channel switch, about its attached/logged in Nx Ports and the service parameters that have been agreed with them.
This group contains information known to a local Fibre Channel management instance, and concerning Fibre Channel links including those which terminate locally.
This MIB is a replacement for two other MIBs:  RFC 2837, and the Fibre Channel Management Integration MIB which was originally submitted as an Internet Draft to the IETF's IPFC Working Group, and is now available as [MIB FA].
The Interfaces Group MIB The Interfaces Group MIB [RFC2863] contains generic information about all lower layer interfaces, i.e., interfaces which are (potentially) below the internet layer.
Thus, each Fibre Channel port should have its own row in the ifTable, and that row will contain the generic information about the interface/port.
The Interfaces Group MIB specifies that additional information which is specific to a particular type of interface media, should be defined in a media  specific MIB.
This MIB is the media specific MIB for Fibre Channel ports/interfaces.
Section 4 of [RFC2863] requires that a media specific MIB clarify how the generic definitions apply for the particular type of media.
The clarifications for Fibre Channel interfaces are as follows.
The Interfaces Group MIB permits multiple ifTable entries to be defined for interface sub layers, and for those multiple entries to be arranged in a stack.
For Fibre Channel interfaces, no sublayers are defined and a Fibre Channel interface will typically have no other ifTable rows stacked on top of it, nor underneath it.
This Fibre Channel MIB does not deal with virtual circuits.
The ifRcvAddressTable does not apply to Fibre Channel interfaces.
The value of ifType for a Fibre Channel interface is 56.
The definitions of ifInOctets and ifOutOctets (and similarly, ifHCInOctets and ifHCOutOctets) specify that their values include framing characters.
For Fibre Channel interfaces, they include all the octets contained in frames between the Start of Frame and End  of Frame delimiters (excluding the delimiters).
Specific Interface Group MIB Objects
The following table provides specific implementation guidelines for applying the objects defined in the Interfaces Group MIB to Fibre Channel interfaces.
For those objects not listed here, refer to their generic definitions in [RFC2863].
(RFC 2863 takes precedence over these guidelines in the event of any conflict.)
That is, when IP is running over the interface, this object is the size of the largest IP datagram that can be sent/received over the interface.
For 1Gbs, this will be 1,000,000,000; for 2Gbs, it will be 2,000,000,000.
If auto negotiation is implemented and enabled on an interface, and the interface has not yet negotiated an operational speed, this object SHOULD reflect the maximum speed supported by the interface.
The interface's 24 bit Fibre Channel Address Identifier, or the zero length string if no Address Identifier has been assigned to the interface.
The value 'dormant' has no meaning for Fibre Channel interfaces.
This is the number of errors in fcmPortOtherErrors that were output errors.
The current operational speed of the interface in millions of bits per second.
For 1Gbs, this will be 1000; for 2Gbs, it will be 2000.
If auto negotiation is implemented and enabled on an interface, and the interface has not yet negotiated an operational speed, this object SHOULD reflect the maximum speed supported by the interface.
This will normally be 'false' ifConnectorPresent
This will normally be 'true'.
The Entity MIB [RFC2737] contains information about individual physical components and any hierarchical relationship that may exist between them.
Any Fibre Channel management instance with a relationship to a physical component (or to a hierarchy of physical components) will have its value of the fcmInstancePhysicalIndex object contain a pointer to the relevant row in the Entity MIB.
If there is no correspondence with a physical component (or said component does not have a row in the Entity MIB), then the value of fcmInstancePhysicalIndex is zero.
(Note that an implementation is not required to support a non zero value of fcmInstancePhysicalIndex.)
The Host Resources MIB [RFC2790] includes information about installed software modules.
Any Fibre Channel management instance with a correspondence to a software module, will have its value of the fcmInstanceSoftwareIndex object contain a pointer to the relevant row in the Host Resources MIB.
If there is no correspondence to a software module (or said software module does not have a row in the Host Resources MIB), then the value of fcmInstanceSoftwareIndex is zero.
(Note that an agent implementation is not required to support a non zero value of fcmInstanceSoftwareIndex.)

There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB that have a MAX ACCESS clause of read write: fcmInstanceTextName fcmInstanceDescr
Such objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.
For example, the ability to change network topology or network speed may afford an attacker the ability to obtain better performance at the expense of other network users; setting fcmSwitchDomainId to an invalid value could lead to denial of service in some configurations.
The support for SET operations in a non secure environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on network operations.
Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a MAX ACCESS other than not accessible) may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.
It is thus important to control
even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over the network via SNMP.
In particular, these objects provide information on network topology:
fcmLinkEnd2PortType fcmLinkEnd2UnitType fcmLinkEnd2FcAddressId SNMP versions
prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec), even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is allowed to access and
the objects in this MIB module.
It is RECOMMENDED that implementors consider the security features as provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8), including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for authentication and privacy).
Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT RECOMMENDED.
Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to enable cryptographic security.
It is then a customer/operator responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate rights to indeed GET or SET
OID Assignment IANA has made a MIB OID assignment under the transmission branch.
Specifically, transmission 56 has been assigned as the OID for fcMgmtMIB.
This sub identifier was requested because this MIB contains the media specific definitions that correspond to the ifType value of fibreChannel(56).
FC Port Type Registry IANA has established a registry for Fibre Channel Port Types.
The registry is split into disjointed subset ranges: 1) a 'standard' range for Fibre Channel Port Types that have been standardized by the InterNational Committee for Information Technology Standards (INCITS)'s Technical Committee T11.
This range will be subject to the 'Expert Review' and 'Specification Required' policies described in [RFC2434], with the following provisions:  the Expert Reviewer is to be appointed by the IESG.
the Expert Reviewer shall obtain approval (or rejection) from INCITS Technical Committee T11 via the chair of that Committee.
Rejected values shall not be added to the registry.
if the addition is approved, the Expert shall advise IANA of how to record the reference to the T11 specification document that describes the newly added port type(s), and that is considered to be the "other permanent and readily available reference" required by [RFC2434].
The initial assignments in the 'standard' range will be as follows:
NL Port    see [FC FS]
F/NL Port  see [FC AL 2]
The above range extends up to a maximum of 9,999. 2)
a range assigned under the "Private Use" policy described in [RFC2434] for values intended for private use by one party or among mutually consenting parties.
Values in this range extend from 10,000 to 99,999.
IANA will not make any allocations from this range.
3) values larger than 99,999 are RESERVED.
Comparison to the Fibre Channel Management Integration MIB 12.1.
Problems with the Fibre Channel Management Integration MIB
The Fibre Channel Management Integration MIB [MIB FA] had the following major problems:
It wasn't formatted using SMIv2, which is mandatory.
The MIB seemed to have been defined with the notion that it would be the only MIB that a Fibre Channel product will require.
The notion of an agent implementing just a single MIB was abandoned by the IETF in 1992 as being non scalable.
Rather, a Fibre Channel MIB needed to be another MIB in the continuing series of MIBs defined by the IETF, and thus, it needed to be consistent with its predecessors.
In other words, there are existing MIBs that all SNMP agents must support, even if the support of Fibre Channel interfaces is the only functionality that they have.
Thus, it was essential that the Fibre Channel Integration MIB contained only objects for information that is specific to Fibre Channel.
All objects relevant to non Fibre Channel environments needed to be removed.
This issue applied to a large fraction of the objects defined in the MIB.
The MIB had some but not complete overlap in functionality with RFC 2837.
Every SNMP agent must implement the ifTable.
The ifTable counters are the MIB objects most well used by administrators in SNMP management.
SNMP agents need to implement a row in the ifTable for each of their network interfaces, including their Fibre Channel interfaces.
The IF MIB requires a media specific MIB to specify how that type of interface uses the ifTable (see section 4 in RFC 2863).
[RFC2837] doesn't do that, nor did the Fibre Channel Integration MIB.
It incorrectly used the OCTET STRING syntax (instead of Counter32 or Counter64) for counters.
Removal of Sensor Related Objects Information about sensors is not specific to Fibre Channel, and therefore should not be in this MIB.
(At the time of writing, the IETF's ENTITY MIB Working Group has produced a first draft of a Sensor MIB, see [RFC3433].)
This removed the need for: connUnitSensorTable (and all its contents) connUnitNumSensors connUnitSensorStatusChange 12.2.2.
Removal of Trap registration Objects Information about registering "traps" is not specific to Fibre Channel, and therefore should not be in this MIB.
(For similar functionality, see SNMP NOTIFICATION MIB and SNMP TARGET MIB in RFC 2573).
This removed the need for: trapMaxClients trapClientCount trapRegTable (and all its contents)
Removal of Event Related Objects Information about generic events is not specific to Fibre Channel, and therefore should not be in this MIB.
(For similar functionality, see the Event group in RFC 2819 and the Notification Log MIB in RFC 3014; the SNMP NOTIFICATION MIB provides for the filtering of notifications.)
This removed the need for: connUnitEventTable (and all its contents) connUnitEventFilter connUnitNumEvents connUnitMaxEvents connUnitEventCurrID
Removal of Inventory Related Information Aspects of hardware (physical) components are represented in the Entity MIB (RFC 2737); aspects of software modules are represented in the Host Resources MIB (RFC 2790).
Two new objects provide indexing from this MIB into those MIBs: one having the value of PhysicalIndex (or zero) and the other having the value of hrSWInstalledIndex (or zero).
These replaced the need for: connUnitNumports connUnitRevsTable (and all its contents)
The forward/backward compatibility rules of how to evolve MIBs are designed such that MIBs do not have revision numbers.
This removed the need for: revisionNumber 12.2.6.
Removal of Other Not FC Specific Information
Other information was removed because it was not specific to Fibre Channel:
systemURL statusChangeTime configurationChangeTime connUnitUrl connUnitUpTime connUnitState
connUnitProxyMaster connUnitControl connUnitStatus connUnitStatusChange 12.2.7.
Clean up of Ambiguous/Obsolete Definitions
Some information in the FC Management integration was obsolete or ambiguous: statusChangeTime (obsolete) configurationChangeTime
(obsolete) connUnitTableChangeTime (obsolete) connUnitStatusChangeTime (obsolete) connUnitConfigurationChangeTime (obsolete) connUnitNumZones (obsolete) connUnitZoneTable (
referenced but not defined) connUnitLinkCurrIndex (badly defined)
Use of an ifTable Entry The following objects were removed because they duplicated existing IF MIB objects:
ifInOctets & ifHCInOctets connUnitPortStatCountRxMulticastObjects ifInMulticastPkts & ifHCInMulticastPkts connUnitPortStatCountTxMulticastObjects ifOutMulticastPkts & ifHCOutMulticastPkts connUnitPortStatCountRxBroadcastObjects
An AgentX environment [RFC2741] consists of a master agent and several sub agents.
It is not difficult to implement the same MIB in several such sub agents if all of the MIB's tables have a common index variable as the first auxiliary object in their INDEX clauses.
However, any scalars that the MIB contains pose a problem for the AgentX environment.
All the (remaining) scalars were therefore removed:
The term "connectivity unit" was changed to "FC management instance".
The term "connectivity unit" was not properly defined in [MIB FA], and its usage provided a confused mixture of indications to the implementor:  the definition of FcUnitType suggested it was functional;  the definition of uNumber suggested it was physical;  the definition of connUnitProduct suggested it was a vendor's product;  etc.
The common implementation strategy for the "connectivity unit" was which ever grouping provided access to the management functionality the easiest.
(One such grouping accommodates a single SNMP agent having multiple AgentX
[RFC2741] sub agents, each supporting a separate implementation of the MIB.)
In fact, this scenario is not new; in practice, a "connectivity unit" will have the same semantics as a management "instance" in other MIBs, e.g., the IPS WG's own iSCSI MIB.
For this MIB, its meaning is: "a separable managed instance of Fibre Channel functionality".
Given this definition, the "FC management instance" is a better name because it is more accurate and more representative of the definition than is "connectivity unit".
All packet and octet counters have been changed to be Counter64's (but Counter32 versions of them are also included for use by old agents).
The error counters have been changed to Counter32's.
(In the probably impossible, and at most improbable, circumstances that the rate of occurrence of errors, even on a 10Gbs Fibre Channel interface, might wrap faster than an hour, the fact that errors are occurring will almost certainly be apparent from other MIB objects.)
Little Used Fibre Channel Features Information relating to Fibre Channel features that are obsolete or not widely implemented has been deleted.
(For more information, see section 6.2.1 and section 6.2.2 of [FC MI].)
Class 1 service,  Intermix Mode,  Stacked Conn Mode.
PH version numbers Note that with support for Class 1 service being deleted, only class 2 now needs F BSY, F RJT, P BSY, and P RJT counters, and thus they no longer need to be counted for all classes as well as for class 2, and therefore the following objects have been deleted:
connUnitPortStatCountFBSYFrames connUnitPortStatCountPBSYFrames connUnitPortStatCountFRJTFrames connUnitPortStatCountPRJTFrames 12.3.
A table of Name Server information was present in the Fibre Channel Management Integration MIB [MIB FA].
That information is not currently represented in this MIB because this MIB is already quite large, and a set of Name Server objects are expected to be defined in a separate (new) MIB.
Additional Objects Support for Class F traffic, including 32 bit octet and frame counters, has been added.
This MIB is a superset of RFC 2837, except for the following:  the fcFeClass1AccountingGroup group is obsolete,  fcFxPortConnectedNxPort, fcFxPortFcphVersionHigh, fcFxPortFcphVersionLow, fcFxPortFcphVersionAgreed, fcFxPortStackedConnModeAgreed, fcFxPortIntermixSuppAgreed, fcFxPortCapStackedConnMode, and fcFxPortCapIntermix are obsolete,  fcFxPortBbCredit and fcFxPortRxBufSize are per attached Nx Port,  fcFxPortBbCreditAvailable is ephemeral,  fcFeModuleTable is mostly contained in the entPhysicalTable,  fcFxPortPhysAdminStatus, fcFxPortPhysOperStatus, and fcFxPortPhysLastChange have equivalents in the ifTable.
