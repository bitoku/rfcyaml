Abstract This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB) for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
In particular, it defines objects for monitoring and controlling network devices with APPN (Advanced Peer to Peer Network)
EBN (Extended Border Node) capabilities.
This memo identifies managed objects for the EBN architecture.
This document is a product of the SNA NAU Services MIB Working Group.
It defines a MIB module for managing devices with Advanced Peer to  Peer Networking (APPN)
Extended Border Node (EBN) capabilities.
The SNMP Network Management Framework
The SNMP Network Management Framework presently consists of six major components.
They are:   the overall architecture, described in RFC 2271 [7].
the SMI, described in RFC 1902 [3], the mechanisms used for describing and naming objects for the purpose of management.
the MIB II, STD 17, RFC 1213 [2], the core set of managed objects for the Internet suite of protocols.
the protocol, STD 15, RFC 1157 [1]
and/or RFC 1905 [6] and/or RFC 2272 [8]   the protocol for accessing managed information.
the user based security model defined in RFC 2274 [10].
the view based access control model defined in RFC 2275 [11].
Textual conventions are defined in RFC 1903 [4], and conformance statements are defined in RFC 1904 [5].
Common applications are defined in RFC 2273 [9].
The Framework permits new objects to be defined for the purpose of experimentation and evaluation.
This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2.
A MIB conforming to the SMIv1 can be produced through the appropriate translation.
This document identifies the proposed set of objects for monitoring the configuration and active characteristics of devices with EBN capabilities.
The Extended Border Node function is an APPN enhancement for an APPN network node (NN).
It supports topology isolation, subnet interconnection, and session establishment between subnets.
In a single APPN network, all network topology information is propagated to all network nodes.
Directory searches can also be forwarded to all network nodes.
As the network grows, this network traffic could become prohibitive.
Also, in networks where different enterprises are connected via APPN, it may be desirable to shield an enterprise from the network traffic of another enterprise.
EBNs allow customers to partition a network into subnets to reduce or shield such network traffic.
An EBN provides this function by blocking topology information exchange between subnets, and controlling where directory searches are forwarded.
A subnetwork is a cluster of APPN NNs which share the same network topology.
Subnetwork boundaries, or partitions, occur where an EBN and an NN adjacent to it have different network identifiers (NETIDs).
They may also occur where an EBN and adjacent NN have the same NETID but are configured to have a subnetwork boundary.
The connection between two APPN nodes is an APPN transmission group (TG).
A TG at a subnet boundary is called an Intersubnetwork Transmission Group (ISTG).
The subnet in which an EBN resides is called its native subnetwork.
The subnet across the subnet boundary is called the non native subnetwork, with respect to the EBN.
A cost of the EBN function is that customers may have difficulty determining the end to end route of sessions that cross subnet boundaries, and understanding how the EBN will control directory searches between subnets.
This MIB addresses these issues.
Another challenge facing customers is to identify subnet boundaries formed by EBNs.
The SNANAU APPN MIB [14] identifies subnet boundaries in the appnNnTopology group.
The SNANAU APPN MIB provides management of APPN objects, and contains some tables that are extended by this MIB.
In this document, we describe EBN managed objects.
The EBN terms and overall architecture are available from the networking.raleigh.ibm.com ftp site [15].
Highlights of the management functions supported by the EBN MIB module include the following:   Identifying the subnet affiliation of LUs (logical units)   Identifying session routes in non native subnets, with correlation to the route in the native subnet provided in the SNANAU APPN MIB.
Identifying the COS (Class of Service) mappings between subnets.
Identifying the subnet routing lists
This MIB module does not support:   Configuration of EBN nodes.
Historical information about session initiation failures.
Peripheral Border Node (PBN) support.
PBN is an APPN function that only supports communication to adjacent subnetworks, and is not expected to be widely implemented.
The APPN MIB contains a trap for Alert conditions that may affect EBN resources.
Although no APPN/EBN Alerts are defined today in the APPN MIB [14], they could exist in the future.
The value for the affectedObject object contained in the alertTrap is determined by the implementation.
It may contain a VariablePointer from the EBN MIB.
The EBN MIB module contains the following groups of objects:   ebnDir subnet information about LUs.
ebnIsRscv provides the RSCV (Route Selection Control Vector) and COS for the subnetwork on the BIND destination side of the EBN.
ebnDirConfig objects related to the EBN directory.
ebnCos COS mapping between subnetworks,
ebnSubnetRoutingList the customer supplied list of where to forward search requests.
hbn HPR (High Performance Routing) EBN intermediate session information.
These groups are described below in more detail.
3.1.1 enbDir group The ebnDir group contains the ebnDirTable, which is an extension to the appnDirTable.
It specifies the subnet affiliation of LUs in the EBN's directory.
group The ebnIsRscv group contains the ebnIsRscvTable, which is an extension to the appnIsInTable.
The appnIsInTable only allows for the RSCV and COS name for one subnetwork traversed by a session.
This extension contains the RSCV and COS name for the other subnetwork.
When an EBN changes RSCVs before forwarding a BIND, appnIsInRouteInfo contains the incoming RSCV, and ebnIsRscvDestinationRoute contains the outgoing RSCV.
The following three cases illustrate the contents of appnIsInRouteInfo and ebnIsRscvDestinationRoute at Extended Border Nodes.
EBN connected to another EBN
SLU   Secondary Logical Unit (session destination)
The value of the appnIsInRouteInfo object at EBN1 is the RSCV containing the route, represented by (1), from the PLU (or the entry EBN in its subnet) to EBN2.
The value of ebnIsRscvDestinationRoute object at EBN1 is the RSCV, represented by (2), containing the one hop route from EBN1 to EBN2.
The appnIsInRouteInfo object at EBN2 also contains the RSCV represented by (2).
The value of ebnIsRscvDestinationRoute in EBN2 is the RSVC containing the route to the SLU (or to the next subnet's entry EBN), represented by (3).
EBN connected to a NN or PBN   subnet 1
The value of the appnIsInRouteInfo object at EBN1 is the RSCV containing the route from the PLU (or the entry EBN in its subnet) to the NN or PBN, represented by (1).
The value of the ebnIsRscvDestinationRoute object at EBN1 is the RSCV containing the route from EBN1 to the SLU, represented by (2).
Note that the SLU must be in subnet 2, because the entry node is an NN or PBN rather than an EBN.
The appnIsInRouteInfo object at NN/
PBN contains the same RSCV, as represented by (2).
The value of the appnIsInRouteInfo object at the NN/PBN is the RSCV containing the route from the PLU to EBN1, represented by (1).
Note that the PLU must be in subnet 1, because the exit node is an NN/PBN rather than an EBN.
The appnIsInRouteInfo object at EBN1 contains the same RSCV.
The value of the ebnIsRscvDestinationRoute object at EBN1 is the RSCV containing the route from EBN1 to the SLU (or the next subnet's entry border node), as represented by (2).
The following three cases illustrate the contents of ebnIsRscvDestinationCos at Extended Border Nodes.
EBN connected to another EBN
A    COS B    PLU   Primary Logical Unit (session initiator)
SLU   Secondary Logical Unit (session destination)
The value of ebnIsRscvDestinationCos object at EBN1 is COS A.
The value of ebnIsRscvDestinationCos object at EBN2 is COS B. 2.
EBN connected to a NN or PBN   subnet 1
The value of the ebvIsRscvDestinationCos object at EBN1 is COS B. 3.
The value of the ebnIsRscvDestinationCos object at the EBN2 is COSB.
The ebnDirConfig group consists of simple objects that provide EBN  specific information about directory caching and the local default value for the maximum number of subnetworks a LOCATE search procedure may traverse.
3.1.4 ebnCos group The ebnCos group contains the ebnCosMapTable, which specifies how COS values are mapped between the non native subnetwork and the native subnetwork.
3.1.5  ebnSubnetRoutingList group The ebnSubnetRoutingList group contains information about the customer supplied EBN subnetwork routing list, which indicates to which adjacent nodes an EBN will forward LOCATE search requests.
It consists of the following tables: 1.
This table has an entry for each LU name that has a defined subnet routing list.
The LU name may identify a single LU, or it may contain a wildcard character that could identify a group of LUs (partial wildcard) or all LUs (full wildcard).
The objects in the table indicate whether the EBN may add dynamic entries to the subnet routing list, and whether the subnet routing list entries may be reordered for better search performance.
This table has an entry for each control point name which is included in a multi subnet search for a particular LU name.
The index to the table is the LU name to be searched for, and an index which lists the order in which the CP names are to be searched.
Both the CP name and the LU name entries in the table allow for partial and full wildcards.
The CP name also allows for  special entries that indicate that the EBN will search itself and its own native subnetwork at this point in the search, or will search all native EBNs.
3.1.6 hbn group The hbn group contains information about HBN (HPR EBN) intermediate sessions.
The hbnIsInTable is an extension to the appnIsInTable.
This table is present for intermediate sessions when there are back  to back RTP (Rapid Transport Protocol) connections in an HBN.
It provides the NCE ID (network connection endpoint identifier) and TCID (transport connection identifier) for the second RTP connection.

Therefore, authentication of received SNMP requests and controlled access to management information SHOULD be employed in such environments.
An authentication protocol is defined in [10].
A protocol for access control is defined in [11].
None of the read only objects in the EBN MIB reports a password, user data, or anything else that is particularly sensitive.
Some enterprises view their network configuration itself, as well as information about network usage and performance, as corporate assets; such enterprises may wish to restrict SNMP access to most of the objects in the MIB.
There are no read write objects in the EBN MIB.
