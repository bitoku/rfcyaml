  - "1.  Introduction\n   Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) Label Switched Path\
    \ (LSP) Ping,\n   as described in [RFC4379], allows an initiator Label Switching\
    \ Router\n   (LSR) to encode instructions (Reply Mode) on how a responder LSR\n\
    \   should send the response back to the initiator LSR.  [RFC7110] also\n   allows\
    \ the initiator LSR to encode a TLV (Reply Path TLV) that can\n   instruct the\
    \ responder LSR to use a specific LSP to send the response\n   back to the initiator\
    \ LSR.  Both approaches are powerful, as they\n   provide the ability for the\
    \ initiator LSR to control the return path.\n   However, it is becoming increasingly\
    \ difficult for an initiator LSR\n   to select a valid return path to encode in\
    \ the MPLS LSP echo request\n   packets.  If the initiator LSR does not select\
    \ a valid return path,\n   the MPLS LSP echo reply will not get back to the initiator\
    \ LSR.  This\n   results in a false failure of MPLS LSP Ping and Traceroute\n\
    \   operations.  In an effort to minimize such false failures, different\n   implementations\
    \ have chosen different default return path encoding\n   for different LSP types\
    \ and LSP operations.  The problem with\n   implementations having different default\
    \ return path encoding is that\n   the MPLS echo reply will not work in many cases,\
    \ and the default\n   value may not be the preferred choice of the operators.\n\
    \   This document describes the following:\n   o  In Section 2, further description\
    \ of the problems;\n   o  In Section 3, a solution to minimize false failures\
    \ while\n      accommodating operator preferences;\n   o  In Section 4, relationships\
    \ to other LSP Ping and Traceroute\n      features;\n   o  In Appendix A, examples\
    \ of scenarios where the mechanism described\n      in this document provides\
    \ benefits.\n   This document updates [RFC7110] by allowing the usage of the \"\
    Reply\n   via Specified Path\" (value=5) Reply Mode without including the Reply\n\
    \   Path TLV.  The update creates a simple way to indicate that the\n   reverse\
    \ LSP should be used as the return path.\n"

- title: 2.  Problem Statements
  contents:
  - "2.  Problem Statements\n   It is becoming increasingly difficult for implementations\
    \ to\n   automatically supply a workable return path encoding for all MPLS LSP\n\
    \   Ping and Traceroute operations across all LSP types.  There are\n   several\
    \ factors that contribute to this complication.\n   o  Some LSPs have a control\
    \ channel, and some do not.  Some LSPs have\n      a reverse LSP, and some do\
    \ not.  Some LSPs have IP reachability in\n      the reverse direction, and some\
    \ do not.\n   o  LSRs on some LSPs can have different available return path(s).\n\
    \      Available return path(s) can depend on whether the responder LSR\n    \
    \  is a transit LSR or an egress LSR.  In the case of a bidirectional\n      LSP,\
    \ available return path(s) on transit LSRs can also depend on\n      whether the\
    \ LSP is completely co-routed, partially co-routed, or\n      associated (i.e.,\
    \ the LSPs in the two directions are not\n      co-routed).\n   o  MPLS echo request\
    \ packets may incorrectly terminate on an\n      unintended target that can have\
    \ different available return path(s)\n      than the intended target.\n   o  The\
    \ MPLS LSP Ping operation is expected to terminate on an egress\n      LSR.  However,\
    \ MPLS LSP Ping operations with specific TTL values\n      and MPLS LSP Traceroute\
    \ operations can terminate on both transit\n      LSR(s) and the egress LSR.\n\
    \   Except for the case where the responder LSR does not have an IP route\n  \
    \ back to the initiator LSR, it is possible to use the \"Reply via an\n   IPv4/IPv6\
    \ UDP packet\" (value=2) Reply Mode value in all cases.\n   However, some operators\
    \ prefer the control channel and a reverse LSP\n   as the default return path\
    \ if they are both available, although this\n   is not always the case.\n   When\
    \ specific return path encoding is supplied by users or\n   applications, then\
    \ there are no issues in choosing the return path\n   encoding.  When specific\
    \ return path encoding is not supplied by\n   users or applications, then implementations\
    \ use extra logic to\n   compute, and sometimes guess, the default return path\
    \ encodings.  If\n   a responder LSR receives an MPLS echo request containing\
    \ return path\n   instructions that cannot be accommodated due to unavailability,\
    \ then\n   the responder LSR often drops such packets.  This failure mode\n  \
    \ results in the initiator LSR not receiving the intended MPLS LSP echo\n   reply\
    \ packets.  The scenario described here is a potentially\n   acceptable result\
    \ in some failure cases, like a broken LSP, where the\n   MPLS echo request terminated\
    \ on an unintended target.  However, if\n   the initiator LSR does not receive\
    \ an MPLS echo reply even after the\n   responder LSR receives the MPLS echo request\
    \ and is able to verify\n   the request, information is still sent back to the\
    \ user(s); this is\n   considered a false failure.\n   Many operators prefer particular\
    \ return path(s) over other return\n   path(s) for specific LSP types.  To accommodate\
    \ operator-preferred\n   paths, implementations may default to operator-preferred\
    \ return paths\n   for particular operations or allow a default return path to\
    \ be\n   configured.  It would not be considered beneficial to use a preferred\n\
    \   return path for an intended target LSR if there is previous knowledge\n  \
    \ at the initiator LSR that the return path is not available.  Using an\n   unavailable\
    \ preferred return path would undesirably result in the\n   initiator LSR not\
    \ receiving the MPLS echo return packets.  It would\n   be considered beneficial,\
    \ for given operations, if the sender of the\n   MPLS echo request would be able\
    \ to determine return path availability\n   before the operation is initiated.\n\
    \   This document (1) updates the procedures for the \"Reply via Specified\n \
    \  Path\" Reply Mode to easily indicate the reverse LSP and (2) adds one\n   optional\
    \ TLV to describe an ordered list of Reply Modes.  Based on\n   operational needs,\
    \ the TLV can list multiple Reply Mode values in a\n   preferred order to allow\
    \ the responder LSR to use the first available\n   Reply Mode from the list. \
    \ This eliminates the need for the initiator\n   LSR to compute, or sometimes\
    \ guess, the default return path encoding.\n   This new mode of operation would\
    \ result in simplified implementations\n   across the various vendors and improve\
    \ both usability and operational\n   needs.\n"

  contents:
  - "3.1.  \"Reply via Specified Path\" Reply Mode Update\n   Some LSP types are capable\
    \ of having a related LSP in the reverse\n   direction, through signaling or other\
    \ association mechanisms.\n   Examples of such LSP types are bidirectional Resource\
    \ Reservation\n   Protocol-Traffic Engineering (RSVP-TE) LSPs [RFC3473] and MPLS\n\
    \   Transport Profile (MPLS-TP) LSPs [RFC5960].  This document uses the\n   term\
    \ \"reverse LSP\" to refer to the LSP in the reverse direction of\n   such LSP\
    \ types.  Note that this document restricts the scope of\n   \"reverse LSP\" applicability\
    \ to those reverse LSPs that are capable\n   and allowed to carry the IP encapsulated\
    \ MPLS echo reply.\n   [RFC7110] has defined the Reply Mode \"Reply via Specified\
    \ Path\",\n   which allows the initiator LSR to instruct the responder LSR to\
    \ send\n   the MPLS echo reply message on the reverse LSP.  However, the\n   instruction\
    \ also requires the initiator LSR to include the Reply Path\n   TLV with the B\
    \ bit (Bidirectional bit) set in the Flags field.\n   Additionally, [RFC7110]\
    \ specifies that if the \"Reply via Specified\n   Path\" Reply Mode is used the\
    \ Reply Path TLV MUST be present.\n   This document updates the procedures for\
    \ the \"Reply via Specified\n   Path\" Reply Mode as follows:\n   o  The \"Reply\
    \ via Specified Path\" Reply Mode MAY be used without\n      including a Reply\
    \ Path TLV.\n   o  The usage of the \"Reply via Specified Path\" Reply Mode without\
    \ the\n      inclusion of a Reply Path TLV implies the reverse LSP.  In other\n\
    \      words, the usage of the \"Reply via Specified Path\" Reply Mode\n     \
    \ without the inclusion of a Reply Path TLV has the same semantics\n      as the\
    \ usage of the \"Reply via Specified Path\" Reply Mode with the\n      inclusion\
    \ of a Reply Path TLV with the B bit set in the Flags\n      field.\n   This document\
    \ updates the first sentence of Section 5.1 of [RFC7110]\n   as follows:\n   o\
    \  When sending an echo request, in addition to the rules and\n      procedures\
    \ defined in Section 4.3 of [RFC4379], the Reply Mode of\n      the echo request\
    \ MUST be set to \"Reply via Specified Path\", and a\n      Reply Path TLV SHOULD\
    \ be carried in the echo request message\n      correspondingly; if the Reply\
    \ Path TLV is not carried in the\n      message, then it indicates the reverse\
    \ LSP as the reply path.\n   Note that the reverse LSP is in relation to the last\
    \ Forwarding\n   Equivalence Class (FEC) specified in the Target FEC Stack TLV.\n"
- title: 3.2.  Reply Mode Order TLV
  contents:
  - "3.2.  Reply Mode Order TLV\n   This document also introduces a new optional TLV\
    \ to describe a list\n   of Reply Mode values.  The new TLV will contain one or\
    \ more Reply\n   Mode values in preferred order.  The first Reply Mode value is\
    \ the\n   most preferred, and the last Reply Mode value is the least preferred.\n\
    \   The following rules apply when using the Reply Mode Order TLV:\n   1.  The\
    \ Reply Mode Order TLV MUST NOT be included in any MPLS echo\n       reply.  If\
    \ the initiator LSR receives an MPLS echo reply with the\n       Reply Mode Order\
    \ TLV, the initiator LSR MUST ignore the whole\n       Reply Mode Order TLV and\
    \ MUST only use the value from the Reply\n       Mode field of the received MPLS\
    \ echo reply.  It may be beneficial\n       for implementations to provide counters\
    \ and/or logs, with\n       appropriate log dampening, to record this error case.\n\
    \   2.  The Reply Mode Order TLV MAY be included in MPLS echo requests.\n   3.\
    \  The Reply Mode field of an MPLS echo request MUST be set to a\n       valid\
    \ value even when supplying the Reply Mode Order TLV.  The\n       initiator LSR\
    \ SHOULD set the Reply Mode field of an MPLS echo\n       request to a value that\
    \ corresponds to a return path that is most\n       likely to be available, in\
    \ case the responder LSR does not\n       understand the Reply Mode Order TLV.\n\
    \   4.  If a responder LSR understands the Reply Mode Order TLV but the\n    \
    \   TLV is not valid (due to the conditions described in items 6, 7,\n       8,\
    \ and 9 below), then the responder LSR MUST ignore the whole\n       Reply Mode\
    \ Order TLV and MUST only use the value from the Reply\n       Mode field of the\
    \ received MPLS echo request.  It may be\n       beneficial for implementations\
    \ to provide counters and/or logs,\n       with appropriate log dampening, to\
    \ record this error case.\n   5.  If a responder LSR understands the Reply Mode\
    \ Order TLV and the\n       TLV is valid, then the responder LSR MUST consider\
    \ the Reply Mode\n       values specified in the TLV and MUST NOT use the value\
    \ specified\n       in the Reply Mode field of the received MPLS echo request.\
    \  In\n       other words, a valid Reply Mode Order TLV overrides the value\n\
    \       specified in the Reply Mode field of the received MPLS echo\n       request.\n\
    \   6.  The Reply Mode Order TLV MUST contain at least one Reply Mode\n      \
    \ value.\n   7.  A Reply Mode value, except for Reply Mode value 5 (Reply via\n\
    \       Specified Path), MUST NOT be repeated (i.e., MUST NOT appear\n       multiple\
    \ times) in the Reply Mode Order TLV.\n   8.  Reply Mode value 5 (Reply via Specified\
    \ Path) MAY be included\n       more than once in the Reply Mode Order TLV.  However,\
    \ in such a\n       case, a Reply Path TLV MUST be included for all instances\
    \ of\n       Reply Mode value 5 that are included in the Reply Mode Order TLV.\n\
    \       In other words, three instances of Reply Mode value 5 in the\n       Reply\

    \ single return\n   path.  When the initiator LSR wants to use the Reply Mode\
    \ Order TLV\n   to specify multiple return paths, then the initiator LSR SHOULD\n\

    \   For the Reply Mode Order TLV, it is also valid to include a \"Reply\n   via\

    \ introduces the Reply Mode Order TLV.  It\n   provides a new way for an unauthorized\
    \ source to gather more network\n   information, especially information regarding\
    \ the potential return\n   path(s) of an LSP.  To protect against unauthorized\
    \ sources using\n   MPLS echo request messages with the Reply Mode Order TLV to\
    \ obtain\n   network information, as also specified in [RFC4379], it is\n   RECOMMENDED\
    \ that implementations provide a means of checking the\n   source addresses of\
    \ MPLS echo request messages against an access list\n   before accepting the message.\n\
    \   Another potential security issue is that the MPLS echo request and\n   reply\
    \ messages are not encrypted; the contents of the MPLS echo\n   request and reply\
    \ messages may therefore be potentially exposed.\n   Although the exposure is\
    \ within the MPLS domain, if such exposure is\n   a concern, some encryption mechanisms\
    \ [MPLS-OPP-ENCR] may be\n   employed.\n"

    \                      Figure 2: Incorrect Forwarding\n   If D is incorrectly\

    \              Figure 3: Non-Co-Routed Bidirectional LSP\n   Some operators may\
    \ prefer and configure \"Reply via Specified Path\" as\n   the default Reply Mode\
    \ but without including the Reply Path TLV, to\n   indicate that the reverse LSP\
    \ is used as the return path when MPLS\n   echo request messages are sent on bidirectional\
    \ LSPs.  Without the\n   extensions described in this document, the following\
    \ behaviors will\n   be seen:\n   o  When LSP Ping is issued from A, the reply\
    \ will come back on the\n      reverse LSP from H.\n   o  When LSP Traceroute\
    \ is issued from A, the replies will come back\n      on the reverse LSP from\
    \ B, G, and H but will encounter a timeout\n      from C and D, as there are no\
    \ reverse LSPs on those nodes.\n   o  When LSP Ping with a specific TTL value\
    \ is issued from A, whether\n      a timeout will be encountered depends on the\
    \ value of the TTL used\n      (i.e., whether or not the MPLS echo request terminates\
    \ on a node\n      that has a reverse LSP).\n   One can argue that the initiator\
    \ LSR can automatically generate the\n   same MPLS echo request with a different\
    \ Reply Mode value to those\n   nodes that time out.  However, such a mechanism\
    \ will result in an\n   extended time for the entire operation to complete (i.e.,\
    \ multiple\n   seconds to multiple minutes).  This is undesirable, and perhaps\n\
    \   unacceptable if the \"user\" is an application.\n   With the extensions described\
    \ in this document, the same procedures\n   can be performed with the Reply Mode\
    \ Order TLV carrying {5, 2}.  When\n   LSP Traceroute is issued, then the following\
    \ output may be displayed\n   without any unnecessary timeout:\n      Success\
    \ (Reply Mode: 5)\n      Success (Reply Mode: 2)\n      Success (Reply Mode: 2)\n\
