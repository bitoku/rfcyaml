  - "Abstract\n   The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) has a mechanism for conveying\n\
    \   the identity of the originator of a request by means of the\n   P-Asserted-Identity\

    \ use of\n   P-Asserted-Identity and P-Preferred-Identity header fields with\n\
    \   certain SIP methods such as UPDATE, REGISTER, MESSAGE, and PUBLISH,\n   and\
    \ does not specify how to handle an unexpected number of URIs or\n   unexpected\

- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) is specified in RFC\
    \ 3261\n   [RFC3261].  RFC 3325 [RFC3325] specifies a mechanism for conveying\n\
    \   the asserted identity of the originator of a SIP request within a\n   Trust\
    \ Domain.  This is achieved by means of the P-Asserted-Identity\n   header field,\
    \ which is specified for use in requests using a number\n   of SIP methods, in\
    \ particular the INVITE method.  In addition, the\n   P-Preferred-Identity header\
    \ field can be used to indicate a\n   preference for which identity should be\
    \ asserted when there is a\n   choice.\n   RFC 3325 does not specify the insertion\
    \ of the P-Asserted-Identity\n   header field by a User Agent Client (UAC) in\
    \ the same Trust Domain as\n   the first proxy.  Also, RFC 3325 does not specify\
    \ the use of the\n   P-Asserted-Identity and P-Preferred-Identity header fields\
    \ with\n   certain SIP methods such as UPDATE [RFC3311], REGISTER, MESSAGE\n \
    \  [RFC3428], and PUBLISH [RFC3903].  This document extends RFC 3325 by\n   allowing\
    \ inclusion of the P-Asserted-Identity header field by a UAC\n   in the same Trust\
    \ Domain as the first proxy and allowing use of\n   P-Asserted-Identity and P-Preferred-Identity\
    \ header fields in any\n   request except ACK and CANCEL.  The reason for these\
    \ two exceptions\n   is that ACK and CANCEL requests cannot be challenged for\
    \ digest\n   authentication.\n   RFC 3325 allows the P-Asserted-Identity and P-Preferred-Identity\n\
    \   header fields each to contain at most two URIs, where one is a SIP or\n  \
    \ SIPS URI [RFC3261] and the other is a TEL URI [RFC3966].  This may be\n   unduly\
    \ restrictive in the future, for example, if there is a need to\n   allow other\
    \ URI schemes, if there is a need to allow both a SIP and a\n   SIPS URI, or if\
    \ there is a need to allow more than one URI with the\n   same scheme (e.g., a\
    \ SIP URI based on a telephone number and a SIP\n   URI that is not based on a\
    \ telephone number).  This document\n   therefore provides forwards compatibility\
    \ by mandating tolerance to\n   the receipt of unexpected URIs.\n   This document\
    \ does not alter the fact that the asserted identity\n   mechanism has limited\
    \ applicability, i.e., within a Trust Domain.\n   For general applicability, including\
    \ operation outside a Trust Domain\n   (e.g., over the public Internet) or between\
    \ different Trust Domains,\n   a different mechanism is needed.  RFC 4474 [RFC4474]\
    \ specifies the\n   Identity header field, in conjunction with the From header\
    \ field, to\n   provide authenticated identity in such circumstances.  RFC 4916\n\
    \   [RFC4916] specifies the use of RFC 4474 in mid-dialog requests, in\n   particular,\
    \ in requests in the reverse direction to the dialog-\n   forming request as a\
    \ means of providing authenticated connected\n   identity.\n   RFC 3325 is unclear\
    \ on the use of P-Asserted-Identity in responses.\n   In contrast to requests,\
    \ there is no means in SIP to challenge a User\n   Agent Server (UAS) to provide\
    \ SIP digest authentication in a\n   response.  As a result, there is currently\
    \ no standardised mechanism\n   whereby a proxy can authenticate a UAS.  Since\
    \ authenticating the\n   source of a message is a prerequisite for asserting an\
    \ identity, this\n   document does not specify the use of the P-Asserted-Identity\
    \ header\n   field in responses.  This may be the subject of a future update to\n\
    \   RFC 3325.  Also, this document does not specify the use of the\n   P-Preferred-Identity\
    \ header field in responses, as this would serve\n   no purpose in the absence\
    \ of the ability for a proxy to insert the\n   P-Asserted-Identity header field.\n"

- title: 3.1.  Inclusion of P-Asserted-Identity by a UAC
  contents:
  - "3.1.  Inclusion of P-Asserted-Identity by a UAC\n   RFC 3325 does not include\
    \ procedures for a UAC to include the\n   P-Asserted-Identity header field in\
    \ a request.  This can be\n   meaningful if the UAC is in the same Trust Domain\
    \ as the first\n   downstream SIP entity.  Examples of types of UACs that are\
    \ often\n   suitable for inclusion in a Trust Domain are:\n   o  Public Switched\
    \ Telephone Network (PSTN) gateways;\n   o  media servers;\n   o  application\
    \ servers (or Back-to-Back User Agents (B2BUAs)) that\n      act as URI list servers\
    \ [RFC5363];\n   o  application servers (or B2BUAs) that perform third party call\n\
    \      control.\n   In the particular case of a PSTN gateway, the PSTN gateway\
    \ might be\n   able to assert an identity received from the PSTN, the proxy itself\n\
    \   having no means to authenticate such an identity.  Likewise, in the\n   case\
    \ of certain application server or B2BUA arrangements, the\n   application server\
    \ or B2BUA may be in a position to assert an\n   identity of a user on the other\
    \ side of that application server or\n   B2BUA.\n   In accordance with RFC 3325,\
    \ nodes within a Trust Domain must behave\n   in accordance with a Spec(T), and\
    \ this principle needs to be applied\n   between a UAC and its proxy as part of\
    \ the condition to consider the\n   UAC to be within the same Trust Domain.  The\
    \ normal proxy procedures\n   of RFC 3325 ensure that the header field is removed\
    \ or replaced if\n   the first proxy considers the UAC to be outside the Trust\
    \ Domain.\n   This update to RFC 3325 clarifies that a UAC may include a\n   P-Asserted-Identity\
    \ header field in a request in certain\n   circumstances.\n"
- title: 3.2.  Inclusion of P-Asserted-Identity in Any Request
  contents:
  - "3.2.  Inclusion of P-Asserted-Identity in Any Request\n   There are several use\
    \ cases that would benefit from the use of the\n   P-Asserted-Identity header\
    \ field in an UPDATE request.  These use\n   cases apply within a Trust Domain\
    \ where the use of asserted identity\n   is appropriate (see RFC 3325).\n   In\
    \ one example, an established call passes through a gateway to the\n   PSTN. \
    \ The gateway becomes aware that the remote party in the PSTN\n   has changed,\
    \ e.g., due to call transfer.  By including the\n   P-Asserted-Identity header\
    \ field in an UPDATE request, the gateway\n   can convey the identity of the new\
    \ remote party to the peer SIP User\n   Agent (UA).\n      Note that the (re-)INVITE\
    \ method could be used in this situation.\n      However, this forces an offer-answer\
    \ exchange, which typically is\n      not required in this situation.  Also, it\
    \ involves three messages\n      rather than two.\n   In another example, a B2BUA\
    \ that provides third party call control\n   (3PCC) [RFC3725] wishes to join two\
    \ calls together, one of which is\n   still waiting to be answered and potentially\
    \ is forked to different\n   UAs.  At this point in time, it is not possible to\
    \ trigger the normal\n   offer-answer exchange between the two joined parties,\
    \ because of the\n   mismatch between a single dialog on the one side and potentially\n\
    \   multiple early dialogs on the other side, so this action must wait\n   until\
    \ one of the called UAs answers.  However, it would be useful to\n   give an early\
    \ indication to each user concerned of the identity of\n   the user to which they\
    \ will become connected when the call is\n   answered.  In other words, it would\
    \ provide the new calling UA with\n   the identity of the new called user and\
    \ provide the new called UA(s)\n   with the identity of the new calling user.\
    \  This can be achieved by\n   the B2BUA sending an UPDATE request with a P-Asserted-Identity\
    \ header\n   field on the dialogs concerned.\n   Within a Trust Domain, a P-Asserted-Identity\
    \ header field could\n   advantageously be used in a REGISTER request between\
    \ an edge proxy\n   that has authenticated the source of the request and the registrar.\n\
    \   Within a Trust Domain, a P-Asserted-Identity header field could\n   advantageously\
    \ be used in a MESSAGE request to assert the source of a\n   page-mode instant\
    \ message.  This would complement its use in an\n   INVITE request to assert the\
    \ source of an instant-message session or\n   any other form of session.  Similarly,\
    \ between a UAC and first proxy\n   that are not within the same Trust Domain,\
    \ a P-Preferred-Identity\n   header field could be used in a MESSAGE request to\
    \ express a\n   preference when the user has several identities.\n   Within a\
    \ Trust Domain, a P-Asserted-Identity header field could\n   advantageously be\
    \ used in a PUBLISH request to assert the source of\n   published state information.\
    \  This would complement its use in\n   SUBSCRIBE and NOTIFY requests.  Similarly,\
    \ between a UAC and first\n   proxy that are not within the same Trust Domain,\
    \ a P-Preferred-\n   Identity header field could be used in a PUBLISH request\
    \ to express a\n   preference when the user has several identities.\n   Thus,\
    \ there are several examples where P-Asserted-Identity could be\n   used in requests\
    \ with methods for which there is no provision in RFC\n   3325.  This leaves a\
    \ few methods for which use cases are less\n   obvious, but the inclusion of P-Asserted-Identity\
    \ would not cause any\n   harm.  In any requests, the header field would simply\
    \ assert the\n   source of that request, whether or not this is of any use to\
    \ the UAS.\n   Inclusion of P-Asserted-Identity in a request requires that the\n\
    \   original asserter of an identity be able to authenticate the source\n   of\
    \ the request.  This implies the ability to challenge a request for\n   SIP digest\
    \ authentication, which is not possible with ACK and CANCEL\n   requests.  Therefore,\
    \ ACK and CANCEL requests need to be excluded.\n   Similarly, there are examples\
    \ where P-Preferred-Identity could be\n   used in requests with methods for which\
    \ there is no provision in RFC\n   3325 or any other RFC (with the exception of\
    \ ACK and CANCEL).\n   This update to RFC 3325 allows a P-Asserted-Identity or\
    \ P-Preferred-\n   Identity header field to be included in any request except\
    \ ACK and\n   CANCEL.\n"

    \ same\n   dialog.  The recipient can make its own deductions about the source\n\

    \   request and where it is connected to that SIP entity in accordance\n   with\

- title: 4.5.  General Handling
  contents:
  - "4.5.  General Handling\n   An entity receiving a P-Asserted-Identity or P-Preferred-Identity\n\
    \   header field can expect the number of URIs and the combination of URI\n  \
    \ schemes in the header field to be in accordance with RFC 3325, any\n   updates\
    \ to RFC 3325, or any Spec(T) that states otherwise.  If an\n   entity receives\
    \ a request containing a P-Asserted-Identity or\n   P-Preferred-Identity header\
    \ field containing an unexpected number of\n   URIs or unexpected URI schemes,\
    \ it MUST act as follows:\n   o  ignore any URI with an unexpected URI scheme;\n\
    \   o  ignore any URI for which the expected maximum number of URIs with\n   \
    \   the same scheme occurred earlier in the header field; and\n   o  ignore any\
    \ URI whose scheme is not expected to occur in\n      combination with a scheme\
    \ that occurred earlier in the header\n      field.\n   In the absence of a Spec(T)\
    \ determining otherwise, this document does\n   not change the RFC 3325 requirement\
    \ that allows each of these header\n   fields to contain at most two URIs, where\
    \ one is a SIP or SIPS URI\n   and the other is a TEL URI, but future updates\
    \ to this document may\n   relax that requirement.  In the absence of such a relaxation\
    \ or a\n   Spec(T) determining otherwise, the RFC 3325 requirement means that\
    \ an\n   entity receiving a request containing a P-Asserted-Identity or\n   P-Preferred-Identity\
    \ header field must act as follows:\n   o  ignore any URI with a scheme other\
    \ than SIP, SIPS, or TEL;\n   o  ignore a second or subsequent SIP URI, a second\
    \ or subsequent SIPS\n      URI, or a second or subsequent TEL URI; and\n   o\
    \  ignore a SIP URI if a SIPS URI occurred earlier in the header\n      field\
    \ and vice versa.\n   A proxy MUST NOT forward a URI when forwarding a request\
    \ if that URI\n   is to be ignored in accordance with the requirement above.\n\
    \   When a UAC or a proxy sends a request containing a P-Asserted-\n   Identity\
    \ header field to another node in the Trust Domain, if that\n   other node complies\
    \ with RFC 3325 but not with this specification,\n   and if the method is not\

    \ field correctly.  To\n   prevent incorrect handling of the Privacy header field\
    \ with value\n   'id', the Spec(T) in force for the Trust Domain SHOULD require\
    \ all\n   nodes to comply with this specification.  If this is not the case, a\n\
    \   UAC or a proxy SHOULD NOT include a P-Asserted-Identity header field\n   in\
    \ a request if the method is not one for which RFC 3325 specifies\n   use of the\

  - "5.  Security Considerations\n   The use of asserted identity raises a number\
    \ of security\n   considerations, which are discussed fully in [RFC3325].  This\n\
    \   document raises the following additional security considerations.\n   When\
    \ adding a P-Asserted-Identity header field to a message, an\n   entity must have\
    \ authenticated the source of the message by some\n   means.  One means is to\
    \ challenge the sender of a message to provide\n   SIP digest authentication.\
    \  Responses cannot be challenged, and also\n   ACK and CANCEL requests cannot\
    \ be challenged.  Therefore, this\n   document limits the use of P-Asserted-Identity\
    \ to requests other than\n   ACK and CANCEL.\n   When sending a request containing\
    \ the P-Asserted-Identity header\n   field and also the Privacy header field with\
    \ value 'id' to a node\n   within the Trust Domain, special considerations apply\
    \ if that node\n   does not support this specification.  Section 4.5 makes a special\n\
    \   provision for this case.\n   When receiving a request containing a P-Asserted-Identity\
    \ header\n   field, a proxy will trust the assertion only if the source is known\n\
    \   to be within the Trust Domain and behaves in accordance with a\n   Spec(T),\
    \ which defines the security requirements.  This applies\n   regardless of the\
    \ nature of the resource (UA or proxy).  One example\n   where a trusted source\
    \ might be a UA is a PSTN gateway.  In this\n   case, the UA can assert an identity\
    \ received from the PSTN, the proxy\n   itself having no means to authenticate\
    \ such an identity.  A SIP\n   entity must not trust an identity asserted by a\
    \ source outside the\n   Trust Domain.  Typically, a UA under the control of an\
    \ individual\n   user (such as a desk phone or mobile phone) should not be considered\n\
    \   part of a Trust Domain.\n   When receiving a response from a node outside\
    \ the Trust Domain, a\n   proxy has no standardised SIP means to authenticate\
    \ the source of the\n   response.  For this reason, this document does not specify\
    \ the use of\n   P-Asserted-Identity or P-Preferred-Identity in responses.\n"
