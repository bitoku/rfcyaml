    \ in the\n   local-part of Internet email addresses, along with an extension\n\
    \   mechanism to allow encoding of additional standard attributes needed\n   for\
    \ email gateways to PSTN-based services.\n   As with all Internet mail addresses,\
    \ the left-hand-side (local- part)\n   of an address generated according to this\

- title: 1. Introduction
  contents:
  - "1. Introduction\n   Since the very first e-mail to PSTN services gateway appeared,\
    \ a\n   number of different methods to specify a PSTN address as an e-mail\n \
    \  address have been used by implementors. Two major objectives for this\n   were\n\
    \     - enable an e-mail user to access these services from his/her\n       e-mail\
    \ interface;\n     - enable some kind of \"PSTN over e-mail service\" transport,\
    \ to\n       reduce the costs of PSTN long distance transmissions, and use the\n\
    \       existing e-mail infrastructure.\n   This memo describes the MINIMAL addressing\
    \ method to encode PSTN\n   addresses into e-mail addresses and the standard extension\
    \ mechanism\n   to allow definition of further standard elements. The opposite\n\
    \   problem, i.e. to allow a traditional numeric-only PSTN device user to\n  \
    \ access the e-mail transport service, is not discussed here.\n   All implementations\
    \ supporting this PSTN over e-mail service MUST\n   support as a minimum the specification\
    \ described in this document.\n   The generic complex case of converting the whole\
    \ PSTN addressing into\n   e-mail is out of scope in this minimal specification:\
    \ there is some\n   work in progress in the field, where also a number of standard\n\
    \   optional extensions are being defined.\n   In this document the formal definitions\
    \ are described using ABNF\n   syntax, as defined into [7]. We will also use some\
    \ of the \"CORE\n   DEFINITIONS\" defined in \"APPENDIX A - CORE\" of that document.\
    \ The\n   exact meaning of the capitalised words\n      \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\"\
    , \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\", \"SHOULD\",\n      \"SHOULD NOT\", \"\
    RECOMMENDED\",  \"MAY\", \"OPTIONAL\"\n   is defined in reference [6].\n"
- title: 2. Minimal PSTN address
  contents:
  - "2. Minimal PSTN address\n   The minimal specification of a PSTN address in e-mail\
    \ address is as\n   follows:\n      pstn-address = pstn-mbox  [ qualif-type1 ]\n\
    \      pstn-mbox = service-selector \"=\" global-phone\n      service-selector\
    \ = 1*( DIGIT / ALPHA / \"-\" )\n                         ; note that SP (space)\
    \ is not allowed in\n                         ; service-selector.\n          \
    \               ; service-selector MUST be handled as a case\n               \
    \          ; INSENSITIVE string by implementations.\n   Specifications adopting\
    \ the \"pstn-address\" definition MUST define a\n   unique case insensitive \"\
    service-selector\" element to identify the\n   specific messaging service involved.\n\
    \   These specifications MUST also define which minimal \"qualif-type1\"\n   extensions,\
    \ if any, MUST be supported for the specified service.\n   Implementations confirming\
    \ to these minimal requirements\n   specification are allowed to ingnore any other\
    \ non-minimal extensions\n   address element which can be present in the \"pstn-address\"\
    . However,\n   conforming implementations MUST preserve all \"qualif-type1\" address\n\
    \   elements they receive.\n   The generic \"qualif-type1\" element is defined\
    \ as:\n      qualif-type1 = \"/\" keyword \"=\" string\n      keyword = 1*( DIGIT\
    \ / ALPHA / \"-\" )\n                ; note that SP (space) is not allowed in\
    \ keyword\n      string = PCHAR\n               ; note that printable characters\
    \ are %x20-7E\n   As such, all \"pstn-address\" extensions elements MUST be defined\
    \ in\n   the \"qualif-type1\" form.\n"
- title: 2.1 Minimal "global-phone" definition
  contents:
  - "2.1 Minimal \"global-phone\" definition\n   We now define the minimal supported\
    \ syntax for global-phone:\n      global-phone = \"+\" 1*( DIGIT , written-sep\
    \ )\n      written-sep = ( \"-\" / \".\" )\n   The use of other dialling schemas\
    \ for PSTN numbers (like private\n   numbering plans or local dialling conventions)\
    \ is also allowed.\n   However, this does not preclude nor remove the minimal\
    \ compulsory\n   requirement to support the \"global-phone\" syntax as defined\
    \ above.\n   Any non \"global-phone\" dialling schema MUST NOT use the leading\
    \ \"+\"\n   between the \"=\" sign and the dialling string. The \"+\" sign is\n\
    \   strictly reserved for the standard \"global-phone\" syntax.\n   Note:\n  \
    \   The specification of these different dialling schemas is out of\n     scope\
    \ for this minimal specification.\n   User specification of PSTN e-mail addresses\
    \ will be facilitated if\n   they can insert these separators between dial elements\
    \ like digits\n   etc.  For this reason we allow them in the syntax the written-sep\n\
    \   element.\n   Implementors' note:\n     Use of the written-sep elements is\
    \ allowed, but not recommended.\n     Any occurences of written-sep elements in\
    \ a pstn-mbox MUST be\n     ignored by all conformant implementations. User Agents\
    \ SHOULD\n     remove written-sep elements before submitting messages to the\n\
    \     Message Transport System.\n"

  contents:
  - "3. The e-mail address of the I-pstn device: mta-I-pstn\n   An \"I-pstn device\"\
    \ has an e-mail address, or to be more exact, a name\n   which enables a mail\
    \ system to identify it on the e-mail global\n   system.\n   In Internet mail,\
    \ this is the Right Hand Side (RHS) part of the\n   address, i.e. the part on\
    \ the right of the \"@\" sign. We will call\n   this \"mta-I-pstn\"\n      mta-I-pstn\
    \ = domain\n   For \"domain\" strings used in SMTP transmissions, the string MUST\n\
    \   conform to the requirements of that standard's <domain>\n   specifications\
    \ [1], [3].  For \"domain\" strings used in message\n   content headers, the string\
    \ MUST conform to the requirements of the\n   relevant standards [2], [3].\n \
    \  Note: in both cases, the standards permit use of \"domain names\" or\n    \
    \     \"domain literals\" in addresses.\n"
- title: 4. The pstn-email
  contents:
  - "4. The pstn-email\n   The complete structure used to transfer a minimal PSTN\
    \ address over\n   the Internet e-mail transport system is called \"pstn-email\"\
    . This\n   object is a an e-mail address which conforms to RFC822 [2] and\n  \
    \ RFC1123 [3] \"addr-spec\" syntax, with some extra structure which\n   allows\
    \ the PSTN number to be identified.\n      pstn-email =  [\"/\"] pstn-address\
    \ [\"/\"] \"@\" mta-I-pstn\n   Implementors' note:\n     The optional \"/\" characters\
    \ can result from other mail transport\n     services gateways, where it is also\
    \ an optional element.\n     Implementations MUST accept the optional slashes\
    \ but SHOULD NOT\n     generate them. Gateways are allowed to strip them off when\n\
    \     converting to Internet mail addressing.\n   It is essential to remind that\
    \ \"pstn-address\" element MUST strictly\n   follow the \"quoting rules\" spcified\
    \ in the relevant standards [2],\n   [3].\n"
- title: 4.1 Multiple subaddresses
  contents:
  - "4.1 Multiple subaddresses\n   In case a particular service requires multiple\
    \ subaddresses (in any\n   form defined by the specific standard specification\
    \ for that\n   service), and these subaddresses need to be given on the same \"\
    pstn-\n   mbox\", multiple \"pstn-email\" elements will be used.\n   Implementors'\
    \ note:\n     The UA could accept multiple subaddress elements for the same\n\
    \     global-phone, but it must generate multiple \"pstn-mbox\" elements\n   \
    \  when passing the message to the MTA.\n"

- title: 5. Conclusions
  contents:
  - "5. Conclusions\n   This proposal creates a minimal standard encoding for PSTN\
    \ addresses\n   within the global e-mail transport system and defines the standard\n\
    \   extension mechanism to be used to introduce specific new elements.\n   The\
    \ proposal requires no changes to existing e-mail software. Each\n   specific\
    \ PSTN service using this proposal MUST define its own\n   \"service-selector\"\
    \ specification and MUST define the eventual other\n   \"qualif-type1\" elements\
    \ to be supported for its minimal addressing\n   specification. An example is\
    \ in reference [13].\n"
- title: 6. Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "6. Security Considerations\n   This document specifies a means by which PSTN\
    \ addresses can be\n   encoded into e-mail addresses. As routing of e-mail messages\
    \ is\n   determined by Domain Name System (DNS) information, a successful\n  \
    \ attack on this service could force the mail path via some particular\n   gateway\
    \ or message transfer agent where mail security can be affected\n   by compromised\
    \ software.\n   There are several means by which an attacker might be able to\
    \ deliver\n   incorrect mail routing information to a client. These include: (a)\n\
    \   compromise of a DNS server, (b) generating a counterfeit response to\n   a\
    \ client's DNS query, (c) returning incorrect \"additional\n   information\" in\
    \ response to an unrelated query. Clients SHOULD ensure\n   that mail routing\
    \ is based only on authoritative answers. Once DNS\n   Security mechanisms [5]\
    \ become more widely deployed, clients SHOULD\n   employ those mechanisms to verify\
    \ the authenticity and integrity of\n   mail routing records.\n"
