  - "                      SURVEY OF FTP MAIL AND MLFL\nTwo surveys of Arpanet Server\
    \ hosts were run between September 20, 1978\nand December 11, 1978.  The intent\
    \ was to determine the response of the\nhost's Server FTP program to:\n(a) An\
    \ attempt to mail to an unknown recipient at that host.  The\npurpose of this\
    \ survey was two-fold.  First, to determine whether the\nhost accepts mail for\
    \ unknown recipients at all, and second, what\nresponse the host gives if it does\
    \ not accept such mail.\n(b) An attempt to mail to a known recipient using the\
    \ MLFL command\nrather than the usual MAIL command.  This survey was undertaken\
    \ to\ndetermine the extent of support for the MLFL command among Server hosts,\n\
    and the sort of reply received if the Server does not support MLFL. MLFL\nis potentially\
    \ a 'better' form of communication than mail as the message\nis sent over a data\
    \ connection rather than the command connection.\nUsing the data connection eliminates\
    \ the 'end-of-mail' marker and\n'command reader' problems sometimes encountered\
    \ over the command\nconnection.\nThe ground rules of the survey were that all\
    \ sites listed as Servers in\nthe MIT/SAIL Host table were surveyed.  In many\
    \ cases, a host listed as\na Server would not respond to an ICP at any time during\
    \ the period of\nthe survey.  Once a host responded with what seemed to me to\
    \ be a\n'definitive' answer, I marked it as such and stopped surveying it.\n \
    \                             MLFL Survey\nThe algorithm used was to ICP to socket\
    \ 3 of the server (the standard\nold-FTP socket).  Once a 300 response was received,\
    \ I sent the MLFL\ncommand.  Where I had the name of a real mailbox at a site\
    \ (a\nHeader-person, for example) I used that, otherwise the name \"**\".  If\
    \ a\nsite asked for a password (response 504) after the MLFL command I gave\n\"\
    USER NETML\" \"PASS NETML\" and retried the MLFL.  If the server replied\nwith\
    \ a 255 SOCK command, I listened for the data-connection to be\nestablished. \
    \ When it was, I transferred the mail file.  Interestingly\nenough, most sites\
    \ implement an RFC queueing algorithm that will allow\nthe user site to attempt\
    \ to establish the data-connection from its end.\nNWG/RFC 751                \
