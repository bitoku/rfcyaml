- title: 1.  Introduction

  - "1.  Introduction\n   The Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP), defined in\
    \ [EAP], is an\n   authentication framework which supports multiple authentication\n\
    \   mechanisms.  EAP may be used on dedicated links, switched circuits,\n   and\
    \ wired as well as wireless links.\n   To date, EAP has been implemented with\
    \ hosts and routers that connect\n   via switched circuits or dial-up lines using\
    \ PPP [RFC1661], IEEE 802\n   wired switches [IEEE-802.1X], and IEEE 802.11 wireless\
    \ access points\n   [IEEE-802.11i].  EAP has also been adopted for IPsec remote\
    \ access in\n   IKEv2 [IKEv2].\n   This document specifies the Diameter EAP application\
    \ that carries EAP\n   packets between a Network Access Server (NAS) working as\
    \ an EAP\n   Authenticator and a back-end authentication server.  The Diameter\
    \ EAP\n   application is based on the Diameter Network Access Server\n   Application\
    \ [NASREQ] and is intended for environments similar to\n   NASREQ.\n   In the\
    \ Diameter EAP application, authentication occurs between the\n   EAP client and\
    \ its home Diameter server.  This end-to-end\n   authentication reduces the possibility\
    \ for fraudulent authentication,\n   such as replay and man-in-the-middle attacks.\
    \  End-to-end\n   authentication also provides a possibility for mutual authentication,\n\
    \   which is not possible with PAP and CHAP in a roaming PPP environment.\n  \
    \ The Diameter EAP application relies heavily on [NASREQ], and in\n   earlier\
    \ versions was part of the Diameter NASREQ application.  It can\n   also be used\
    \ in conjunction with NASREQ, selecting the application\n   based on the user\
    \ authentication mechanism (EAP or PAP/CHAP).  The\n   Diameter EAP application\
    \ defines new Command-Codes and Attribute-\n   Value Pairs (AVPs), and can work\
    \ together with RADIUS EAP support\n   [RFC3579].\n"

  contents:
  - "2.1.  Advertising Application Support\n   Diameter nodes conforming to this specification\
    \ MUST advertise\n   support by including the Diameter EAP Application ID value\
    \ of 5 in\n   the Auth-Application-Id AVP of the Capabilities-Exchange-Request\
    \ and\n   Capabilities-Exchange-Answer command [BASE].\n   If the NAS receives\
    \ a response with the Result-Code set to\n   DIAMETER_APPLICATION_UNSUPPORTED\
    \ [BASE], it indicates that the\n   Diameter server in the home realm does not\
    \ support EAP.  If possible,\n   the access device MAY attempt to negotiate another\
    \ authentication\n   protocol, such as PAP or CHAP.  An access device SHOULD be\
    \ cautious\n   when determining whether a less secure authentication protocol\
    \ will\n   be used, since this could result from a downgrade attack (see\n   Section\
    \ 8.3).\n"
- title: 2.2.  Protocol Overview
  contents:
  - "2.2.  Protocol Overview\n   The EAP conversation between the authenticating peer\
    \ and the access\n   device begins with the initiation of EAP within a link layer,\
    \ such as\n   PPP [RFC1661] or IEEE 802.11i [IEEE-802.11i].  Once EAP has been\n\
    \   initiated, the access device will typically send a Diameter-EAP-\n   Request\
    \ message with an empty EAP-Payload AVP to the Diameter server,\n   signifying\
    \ an EAP-Start.\n   If the Diameter home server is willing to do EAP authentication,\
    \ it\n   responds with a Diameter-EAP-Answer message containing an EAP-Payload\n\
    \   AVP that includes an encapsulated EAP packet.  The Result-Code AVP in\n  \
    \ the message will be set to DIAMETER_MULTI_ROUND_AUTH, signifying that\n   a\
    \ subsequent request is expected.  The EAP payload is forwarded by\n   the access\
    \ device to the EAP client.  This is illustrated in the\n   diagram below.\n \

    \                          :\n   The initial Diameter-EAP-Answer in a multi-round\
    \ exchange normally\n   includes an EAP-Request/Identity, requesting the EAP client\
    \ to\n   identify itself.  Upon receipt of the EAP client's EAP-Response, the\n\
    \   access device will then issue a second Diameter-EAP-Request message,\n   with\
    \ the client's EAP payload encapsulated within the EAP-Payload\n   AVP.\n   A\
    \ preferred approach is for the access device to issue the\n   EAP-Request/Identity\
    \ message to the EAP client, and forward the\n   EAP-Response/Identity packet,\
    \ encapsulated within the EAP-Payload\n   AVP, as a Diameter-EAP-Request to the\
    \ Diameter server (see the\n   diagram below).  This alternative reduces the number\
    \ of Diameter\n   message round trips.  When the EAP-Request/Identity message\
    \ is issued\n   by the access device, it SHOULD interpret the EAP-Response/Identity\n\
    \   packet returned by the authenticating peer, and copy its value to a\n   User-Name\
    \ AVP in Diameter-EAP-Request.  This is useful in roaming\n   environments, since\
    \ the Destination-Realm is needed for routing\n   purposes.  Note that this alternative\
    \ cannot be universally employed,\n   as there are circumstances in which a user's\
    \ identity is not needed\n   (such as when authorization occurs based on a calling\
    \ or called phone\n   number).\n   User                             NAS      \

  contents:
  - "2.4.  Invalid Packets\n   While acting as a pass-through, the NAS MUST validate\
    \ the EAP header\n   fields (Code, Identifier, Length) prior to forwarding an\
    \ EAP packet\n   to or from the Diameter server.  On receiving an EAP packet from\
    \ the\n   peer, the NAS checks the Code (Code 2=Response) and Length fields,\n\
    \   and matches the Identifier value against the current Identifier,\n   supplied\
    \ by the Diameter server in the most recently validated EAP\n   Request.  On receiving\
    \ an EAP packet from the Diameter server\n   (encapsulated within a Diameter-EAP-Answer),\
    \ the NAS checks the Code\n   (Code 1=Request) and Length fields, then updates\
    \ the current\n   Identifier value.  Pending EAP Responses that do not match the\n\
    \   current Identifier value are silently discarded by the NAS.\n   Since EAP\
    \ method fields (Type, Type-Data) are typically not validated\n   by a NAS operating\
    \ as a pass-through, despite these checks it is\n   possible for a NAS to forward\
    \ an invalid EAP packet to or from the\n   Diameter server.\n   A Diameter server\
    \ receiving an EAP-Payload AVP that it does not\n   understand SHOULD determine\
    \ whether the error is fatal or non-fatal\n   based on the EAP Type.  A Diameter\
    \ server determining that a fatal\n   error has occurred MUST send a Diameter-EAP-Answer\
    \ with a failure\n   Result-Code and an EAP-Payload AVP encapsulating an EAP Failure\n\
    \   packet.  A Diameter server determining that a non-fatal error has\n   occurred\
    \ MUST send a Diameter-EAP-Answer with\n   DIAMETER_MULTI_ROUND_AUTH Result-Code,\
    \ but no EAP-Payload AVP.  To\n   simplify RADIUS translation, this message MUST\
    \ also include an\n   EAP-Reissued-Payload AVP encapsulating the previous EAP\
    \ Request sent\n   by the server.\n   When receiving a Diameter-EAP-Answer without\
    \ an EAP-Payload AVP (and\n   DIAMETER_MULTI_ROUND_AUTH Result-Code), the NAS\
    \ SHOULD discard the\n   EAP-Response packet most recently transmitted to the\
    \ Diameter server\n   and check whether additional EAP Response packets that match\
    \ the\n   current Identifier value have been received.  If so, a new EAP\n   Response\
    \ packet, if available, MUST be sent to the Diameter server\n   within an Diameter-EAP-Request.\
    \  If no EAP Response packet is\n   available, then the previous EAP Request is\
    \ resent to the peer, and\n   the retransmission timer is reset.\n   In order\
    \ to provide protection against Denial of Service (DoS)\n   attacks, it is advisable\
    \ for the NAS to allocate a finite buffer for\n   EAP packets received from the\
    \ peer, and to discard packets according\n   to an appropriate policy once that\
    \ buffer has been exceeded.  Also,\n   the Diameter server is advised to permit\
    \ only a modest number of\n   invalid EAP packets within a single session, prior\
    \ to terminating the\n   session with DIAMETER_AUTHENTICATION_REJECTED Result-Code.\
    \  By\n   default, a value of 5 invalid EAP packets is recommended.\n"
- title: 2.5.  Retransmission
  contents:
  - "2.5.  Retransmission\n   As noted in [EAP], if an EAP packet is lost in transit\
    \ between the\n   authenticating peer and the NAS (or vice versa), the NAS will\n\
    \   retransmit.\n   It may be necessary to adjust retransmission strategies and\n\
    \   authentication time-outs in certain cases.  For example, when a token\n  \
    \ card is used, additional time may be required to allow the user to\n   find\
    \ the card and enter the token.  Since the NAS will typically not\n   have knowledge\
    \ of the required parameters, these need to be provided\n   by the Diameter server.\n\
    \   If a Multi-Round-Time-Out AVP [BASE] is present in a Diameter-EAP-\n   Answer\

- title: 2.6.  Fragmentation
  contents:
  - "2.6.  Fragmentation\n   Using the EAP-Payload AVP, it is possible for the Diameter\
    \ server to\n   encapsulate an EAP packet that is larger than the MTU on the link\n\
    \   between the NAS and the peer.  Since it is not possible for the\n   Diameter\

    \ exceeds\n   that specified by the Framed-MTU value, taking the link type\n \
    \  (specified by the NAS-Port-Type AVP) into account.  For example, as\n   noted\

    \ as an\n   indication that access was granted.  In this case, the Result-Code\n\
    \   SHOULD match the contained EAP packet: a successful Result-Code for\n   EAP-Success,\
    \ and a failure Result-Code for EAP-Failure.  If the\n   encapsulated EAP packet\
    \ does not match the result implied by the\n   Result-Code AVP, the combination\
    \ is likely to cause confusion,\n   because the NAS and peer will conclude the\
    \ outcome of the\n   authentication differently.  For example, if the NAS receives\
    \ a\n   failure Result-Code with an encapsulated EAP Success, it will not\n  \
    \ grant access to the peer.  However, on receiving the EAP Success, the\n   peer\
    \ will be led to believe that access was granted.\n   This situation can be difficult\
    \ to avoid when Diameter proxy agents\n   make authorization decisions (that is,\
    \ proxies can change the\n   Result-Code AVP sent by the home server).  Because\
    \ it is the\n   responsibility of the Diameter server to avoid conflicts, the\
    \ NAS\n   MUST NOT \"manufacture\" EAP result packets in order to correct the\n\
    \   contradictory messages that it receives.  This behavior, originally\n   mandated\
    \ within [IEEE-802.1X], is now deprecated.\n"

    \   authenticatees at the same time, in two simultaneous and independent\n   EAP\
    \ conversations.\n   This specification is intended for communication between\
    \ EAP\n   (passthrough) authenticator and backend authentication server.  A\n\
    \   Diameter client MUST NOT send a Diameter-EAP-Request encapsulating an\n  \
    \ EAP Request packet, and a Diameter server receiving such a packet\n   MUST respond\
    \ with a failure Result-Code.\n"
- title: 2.8.5.  Identifier Space
  contents:
  - "2.8.5.  Identifier Space\n   In EAP, each session has its own unique Identifier\
    \ space.  Diameter\n   server implementations MUST be able to distinguish between\
    \ EAP\n   packets with the same Identifier existing within distinct EAP\n   sessions\
    \ and originating on the same NAS.  This is done by using the\n   Session-Id AVP.\n\
    \   If a Diameter NAS is in the middle of a multi-round authentication\n   exchange,\
    \ and it detects that the EAP session between the client and\n   the NAS has been\
    \ terminated, it MUST select a new Diameter Session-Id\n   for any subsequent\
    \ EAP sessions.  This is necessary in order to\n   distinguish a restarted EAP\
    \ authentication process from the\n   continuation of an ongoing process (by the\
    \ same user on the same NAS\n   and port).\n   In RADIUS, the same functionality\
    \ can be achieved through the\n   inclusion or omission of the State attribute.\
    \  Translation rules in\n   [NASREQ] ensure that an Access-Request without the\
    \ State attribute\n   maps to a new Diameter Session-Id AVP value.  Furthermore,\
    \ a\n   translation agent will always include a State attribute in\n   Access-Challenge\
    \ messages, making sure that the State attribute is\n   available for a RADIUS\
    \ NAS.\n"

- title: 8.1.  Overview
  contents:
  - "8.1.  Overview\n   Diameter peer-to-peer connections can be protected with IPsec\
    \ or TLS.\n   These mechanisms are believed to provide sufficient protection under\n\
    \   the normal Internet threat model, that is, assuming the authorized\n   nodes\
    \ engaging in the protocol have not been compromised, but the\n   attacker has\
    \ complete control over the communication channels between\n   them.  This includes\
    \ eavesdropping, message modification, insertion,\n   man-in-the-middle and replay\
    \ attacks.  The details and related\n   security considerations are discussed\
    \ in [BASE].\n   In addition to authentication provided by IPsec or TLS, authorization\n\
    \   is also required.  Here, authorization means determining if a\n   Diameter\
    \ message received from an authenticated Diameter peer should\n   be accepted\
    \ (and not authorization of users requesting network access\n   from a NAS). \
    \ In other words, when a Diameter server receives a\n   Diameter-EAP-Request,\
    \ it has to decide if the client is authorized to\n   act as a NAS for the specific\
    \ user, service type, and so on.\n   Correspondingly, when a NAS contacts a server\
    \ to send a\n   Diameter-EAP-Request, it has to determine whether the server is\n\
    \   authorized to act as home server for the realm in question.\n   Authorization\
    \ can involve local Access Control Lists (ACLs),\n   information contained in\
    \ certificates, or some other means.  See\n   [BASE] for more discussion and related\
    \ security considerations.  Note\n   that authorization issues are particularly\
    \ relevant when Diameter\n   redirects are used.  While redirection reduces the\
    \ number of nodes\n   which have access to the contents of Diameter messages,\
    \ a compromised\n   Diameter agent may not supply the right home server's address.\
    \  If\n   the Diameter client is unable to tell whether this particular server\n\
    \   is authorized to act as the home server for this particular user, the\n  \
    \ security of the communications rests on the redirect agent.\n   The hop-by-hop\
    \ security mechanisms (IPsec and TLS) combined with\n   proper authorization provide\
    \ good protection against \"outside\"\n   attackers, except for denial-of-service\
    \ attacks.  The remaining part\n   of this section deals with attacks by nodes\
    \ that have been properly\n   authorized (to function as a NAS, Diameter agent,\
    \ or Diameter\n   server), but abuse their authorization or have been compromised.\
    \  In\n   general, it is not possible to completely protect against attacks by\n\
    \   compromised nodes, but this section offers advice on limiting the\n   extent\
    \ of the damage.\n   Attacks involving eavesdropping or modification of EAP messages\
    \ are\n   beyond the scope of these document.  See [EAP] for discussion of\n \
    \  these security considerations (including method negotiation,\n   dictionary\
    \ attacks, and privacy issues).  While these attacks can be\n   carried out by\
    \ an attacker between the client and the NAS,\n   compromised NASes and Diameter\
    \ agents are naturally also in a good\n   position to modify and eavesdrop on\
    \ the EAP messages.\n   Similarly, attacks involving the link layer protocol used\
    \ between the\n   client and the NAS, such as PPP or IEEE 802.11, are beyond the\
    \ scope\n   of this document.\n"
- title: 8.2.  AVP Editing
  contents:
  - "8.2.  AVP Editing\n   Diameter agents can modify, insert, and delete AVPs.  Diameter\
    \ agents\n   are usually meant to modify AVPs, and the protocol cannot distinguish\n\
    \   well-intentioned and malicious modifications (see [RFC2607] for more\n   discussion).\
    \  Similarly, a compromised NAS or server can naturally\n   include a different\
    \ set of AVPs than expected.\n   Therefore, the question is what an attacker who\
    \ compromises an\n   authorized NAS, agent, or server can do using Diameter EAP\
    \ messages.\n   Some of the consequences are rather obvious.  For instance, a\n\
    \   Diameter agent can give access to unauthorized users by changing the\n   Result-Code\
    \ to DIAMETER_SUCCESS.  Other consequences are less obvious\n   and are discussed\
    \ below and authentication method negotiation attacks\n   are discussed in the\
    \ next section.\n   By including suitable AVPs in an AA-Answer/Diameter-EAP-Answer\n\
    \   messages, an attacker may be able (depending on implementation and\n   configuration\
    \ details) to:\n   o  Give unauthorized users access, or deny access to authorized\
    \ users\n      (Result-Code).\n   o  Give an attacker a login session to a host\
    \ otherwise protected by\n      firewalls, or redirect an authorized user's login\
    \ session to a\n      host controlled by the attacker (Login-Host).\n   o  Route\
    \ an authorized user's traffic through a host controlled by\n      the attacker\
    \ (various tunneling AVPs).\n   o  Redirect an authorized user's DNS requests\
    \ to a malicious DNS\n      server (various vendor-specific AVPs).\n   o  Modify\
    \ routing tables at the NAS and thus redirect packets\n      destined for someone\
    \ else (Framed-Route, Framed-Routing).\n   o  Remove packet filters and other\
    \ restrictions for user (Filter,\n      Callback, various vendor-specific AVPs).\n\
    \   o  Cause the NAS to call some number, possibly an expensive toll\n      number\
    \ controlled by the attacker (callback AVPs).\n   o  Execute Command Line Interface\
    \ (CLI) commands on the NAS (various\n      vendor-specific attributes).\n   By\
    \ modifying an AA-Request/Diameter-EAP-Request, an attacker may be\n   able to:\n\
    \   o  Change NAS-Identifier/NAS-Port/Origin-Host (or another attribute)\n   \
    \   so that a valid user appears to be accessing the network from a\n      different\
    \ NAS than in reality.\n   o  Modify Calling-Station-ID (either to hide the true\
    \ value, gain\n      access, or frame someone else).\n   o  Modify password change\

- title: 8.3.  Negotiation Attacks
  contents:
  - "8.3.  Negotiation Attacks\n   This section deals with attacks where the NAS,\
    \ any Diameter agents,\n   or Diameter server attempt to cause the authenticating\
    \ user to choose\n   some authentication method other than EAP, such as PAP or\
    \ CHAP\n   (negotiation attacks within EAP are discussed in [EAP], Section 7.8).\n\
    \   The vulnerability can be mitigated via implementation of a per-\n   connection\
    \ policy by the authenticating peer, and a per-user policy\n   by the Diameter\
    \ server.  For the authenticating peer, the\n   authentication policy should be\
    \ set on a per-connection basis.\n   With a per-connection policy, an authenticating\
    \ peer will only\n   attempt to negotiate EAP for a session in which EAP support\
    \ is\n   expected.  As a result, it is presumed that an authenticating peer\n\
    \   selecting EAP requires that level of security.  If it cannot be\n   provided,\
    \ there is likely a misconfiguration, or the authenticating\n   peer may be contacting\
    \ the wrong server.  In this case, the\n   authenticating peer simply disconnects.\n\
    \   Similarly, with a per-user policy, the home server will not accept\n   authentication\
    \ methods other than EAP for users for which EAP support\n   is expected.\n  \
    \ For a NAS, it may not be possible to determine whether a peer is\n   required\
    \ to authenticate with EAP until the peer's identity is known.\n   For example,\
    \ for shared-uses NASes one reseller may implement EAP\n   while another does\
    \ not.  Alternatively, some peer might be\n   authenticated locally by the NAS\
    \ while other peers are authenticated\n   via Diameter.  In such cases, if any\
    \ peers of the NAS MUST do EAP,\n   then the NAS MUST attempt to negotiate EAP\
    \ for every session.  This\n   avoids forcing a peer to support more than one\
    \ authentication type,\n   which could weaken security.\n"
- title: 8.4.  Session Key Distribution
  contents:
  - "8.4.  Session Key Distribution\n   Since there are currently no end-to-end (NAS-to-home\
    \ server) security\n   mechanisms specified for Diameter, any agents that process\n\
    \   Diameter-EAP-Answer messages can see the contents of the\n   EAP-Master-Session-Key\
    \ AVP.  For this reason, this specification\n   strongly recommends avoiding Diameter\
    \ agents when they cannot be\n   trusted to keep the keys secret.\n   In environments\
    \ where agents are present, several factors should be\n   considered when deciding\
    \ whether the agents that are authorized (and\n   considered \"trustworthy enough\"\
    ) to grant access to users and specify\n   various authorization and tunneling\
    \ AVPs are also \"trustworthy\n   enough\" to handle the session keys.  These\
    \ factors include (but are\n   not limited to) the type of access provided (e.g.,\
    \ public Internet or\n   corporate internet), security level of the agents, and\
    \ the\n   possibilities for attacking user's traffic after it has been\n   decrypted\
    \ by the NAS.\n   Note that the keys communicated in Diameter messages are usually\n\
    \   short-term session keys (or short-term master keys that are used to\n   derive\
    \ session keys).  To actually cause any damage, those session\n   keys must end\
    \ up with some malicious party that must be able to\n   eavesdrop, modify, or\
    \ insert traffic between the user and the NAS\n   during the lifetime of those\
    \ keys (for example, in 802.11i the\n   attacker must also eavesdrop the \"four-way\
    \ handshake\").\n"
- title: 8.5.  Privacy Issues
  contents:
  - "8.5.  Privacy Issues\n   Diameter messages can contain AVPs that can be used\
    \ to identify the\n   user (e.g., User-Name) and approximate location of the user\
    \ (e.g.,\n   Origin-Host for WLAN access points, Calling-Station-Id for fixed\n\
    \   phone lines).  Thus, any Diameter nodes that process the messages may\n  \
    \ be able to determine the geographic location of users.\n   Note that in many\
    \ cases, the user identity is also sent in clear\n   inside EAP-Payload AVPs,\
    \ and it may be possible to eavesdrop this\n   between the user and the NAS.\n\
    \   This can be mitigated somewhat by using EAP methods that provide\n   identity\
    \ protection (see [EAP], Section 7.3), and using Session-Id or\n   pseudonyms\
    \ for accounting.\n"
- title: 8.6.  Note about EAP and Impersonation
  contents:
  - "8.6.  Note about EAP and Impersonation\n   If the EAP method used does not provide\
    \ mutual authentication,\n   obviously anyone can impersonate the network to the\
    \ user.  Even when\n   EAP mutual authentication is used, it occurs between the\
    \ user and the\n   Diameter home server.  See [EAPKey] for an extensive discussion\
    \ about\n   the details and their implications.\n   One issue is worth pointing\
    \ out here.  As described in [EAPKey], the\n   current EAP architecture does not\
    \ allow the home server to restrict\n   what service parameters or identities\
    \ (such as SSID or BSSID in\n   802.11 wireless LANs) are advertised by the NAS\
    \ to the client.  That\n   is, a compromised NAS can change its BSSID or SSID,\
    \ and thus appear\n   to offer a different service than intended.  Even if these\
    \ parameters\n   are included in Diameter-EAP-Answer messages, the NAS can tell\n\
    \   different values to the client.\n   Therefore, the NAS's possession of the\
    \ session keys proves that the\n   user is talking to an authorized NAS, but a\
    \ compromised NAS can lie\n   about its exact identity.  See [EAPKey] for discussion\
    \ on how\n   individual EAP methods can provide authentication of NAS service\n\
    \   parameters and identities.\n   Note that the usefulness of this authentication\
    \ may be rather limited\n   in many environments.  For instance, in wireless LANs\
    \ the user does\n   not usually securely know the identity (such as BSSID) of\
    \ the \"right\"\n   access point; it is simply picked from a beacon message that\
    \ has the\n   correct SSID and good signal strength (something that is easy to\n\
    \   spoof).  Thus, simply authenticating the identity may not allow the\n   user\
    \ to distinguish the \"right\" access point from all others.\n"
