- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   Many IETF working groups and participants make use of GitHub\
    \ in\n   different ways as part of their work on IETF documents.  Some others\n\
    \   are interested in having their working groups use GitHub to\n   facilitate\
    \ the development of working group documents, but they are\n   unfamiliar with\
    \ how to get started or unclear about which conventions\n   to follow.  Some other\
    \ working groups use or plan to use other code-\n   repository services such as\
    \ GitLab and Bitbucket, which have\n   different properties than GitHub.\n   This\
    \ document specifies a set of administrative processes and\n   conventions for\
    \ IETF working groups to use if they choose as a\n   working group to use GitHub\
    \ to facilitate their work.  The\n   specifications in this document are not directed\
    \ at working groups or\n   individuals that are already using GitHub to do IETF\
    \ work.  Practices\n   vary among existing working groups, and some of them are\
    \ not\n   consistent with the conventions proposed here: that is fine.  The\n\
    \   goal of the specifications in this document is not to require\n   uniformity\
    \ in current practice, but to help working groups get\n   started using GitHub\
    \ in a reviewed and validated way, if desired.\n"
- title: 2.  Administrative Process and Conventions
  contents:
  - "2.  Administrative Process and Conventions\n   This section specifies an administrative\
    \ process and conventions to\n   support the creation and management of GitHub\
    \ organizations for\n   working groups and single-document repositories in a uniform\
    \ way.\n   The steps may be done manually by the IETF Secretariat, or they may\n\
    \   be automated.  See <https://github.com/richsalz/ietf-gh-scripts> and\n   <https://github.com/martinthomson/i-d-template>\
    \ for working examples\n   of automation that is in use in some working groups.\n\
    \   In this document the question of whether processes should be manual\n   or\
    \ automated is deliberately left unspecified, since these are\n   implementation\
    \ details that the IETF Secretariat and Tools Team will\n   address.\n   Most\
    \ of the conventions below are drawn from [RFC8874].\n"
- title: 2.1.  Creation of GitHub Organizations
  contents:
  - "2.1.  Creation of GitHub Organizations\n   This document specifies that there\
    \ be a facility in the IETF\n   Datatracker (<https://datatracker.ietf.org/>)\
    \ interface to allow an\n   area director (AD) or working group chair to request\
    \ the creation of\n   a GitHub organization for a particular working group.  Ideally,\
    \ this\n   facility would appear both as part of the working group chartering\
    \ UI\n   and the working group page UI.\n   When an area director or working group\
    \ chair makes a request to\n   create a GitHub organization, the following process\
    \ would be\n   initiated:\n   1.  Create a GitHub organization for the working\
    \ group.\n   2.  Name the organization in the format ietf-wg-<wgname>...\n   3.\
    \  Initialize the organization by designating the IETF Secretariat\n       and\
    \ the area directors in the working group's area as owners.  If\n       the responsible\
    \ AD for the working group is from another area,\n       that AD will be an owner\
    \ as well.\n   4.  Initialize the organization with a team that has administrator\n\
    \       access.  This team will consist of the working group chairs and\n    \
    \   working group secretary, if one exists.\n   After the organization is created,\
    \ the URL for the organization would\n   be added to the working group's page\
    \ in the Datatracker.\n   Steps 3 and 4 above imply that the GitHub identities\
    \ of the\n   organization owners and administrators are known.  Recording GitHub\n\
    \   identities in the Datatracker (see\n   <https://trac.tools.ietf.org/tools/ietfdb/ticket/2548>)\
    \ would\n   facilitate this.  The person requesting the organization would need\n\
    \   to be notified if the GitHub identities of any of the people meant to\n  \
    \ be owners or administrators were not available.\n"
- title: 2.2.  Migration of an Existing Organization
  contents:
  - "2.2.  Migration of an Existing Organization\n   If a working group already has\
    \ an organization, it would be useful to\n   be able to make it have the same\
    \ management as one would get by going\n   through the steps in Section 2.1. \
    \ That is, it would be good to be\n   able to run Steps 3 and 4 from Section 2.1\
    \ so that the rest of the\n   activities in this section, such as personnel changes,\
    \ work the same\n   way as for organizations that were created as specified herein.\n"
- title: 2.3.  Personnel Changes
  contents:
  - "2.3.  Personnel Changes\n   When there are personnel changes in the area or the\
    \ working group,\n   those changes would be reflected in the GitHub organization.\
    \  There\n   should be an ability in the Datatracker to specify that personnel\n\
    \   changes have occurred.\n"
- title: 2.4.  Working Group Closing
  contents:
  - "2.4.  Working Group Closing\n   When a working group is closed, the team with\
    \ administrative access\n   would be removed, and the owner list would be returned\
    \ to the\n   Secretariat and current ADs at the time of closing.  The organization\n\
    \   summary and the repositories within the organization would be updated\n  \
    \ to indicate that they are no longer under development.  Later, the\n   owner\
    \ list could become just the Secretariat, or it might include\n   others chosen\
    \ by the Secretariat or the IESG.\n"
- title: 2.5.  Creation of Document Repository
  contents:
  - "2.5.  Creation of Document Repository\n   There are many different scenarios\
    \ and configurations where it might\n   be useful to have automation or established\
    \ administrative\n   conventions for repositories within WG organizations, such\
    \ as:\n   *  Creating a new repository for an individual draft (at the\n     \
    \ discretion of the WG chair);\n   *  Creating a new repository for an already\
    \ adopted working group\n      draft;\n   *  Migrating an existing document repository\
    \ into the WG\n      organization; and\n   *  Creating a new repository that contains\
    \ multiple drafts.\n   As an incremental step, this document specifies that there\
    \ be a\n   facility in the Datatracker interface to allow an administrator of\
    \ an\n   ietf-wg-<wgname> organization to request the creation of a new\n   repository\
    \ within that organization for a single document.  The\n   document authors would\
    \ be identified as collaborators.  The\n   repository name would be the draft\
    \ name.  Ideally, the repository\n   would be configured with a skeleton draft\
    \ file, default CONTRIBUTING,\n   LICENSE, and README files, and continuous integration\
    \ support, in the\n   vein of <https://github.com/martinthomson/i-d-template>.\
    \  Performing\n   this step would automatically inform the IETF Secretariat that\
    \ this\n   repository should be backed up as described in Section 3.2.\n"
- title: 2.6.  Listing Related Repositories
  contents:
  - "2.6.  Listing Related Repositories\n   The IETF Datatracker should allow users\
    \ to add links to repositories\n   (for GitHub and other repository services)\
    \ on working group,\n   document, and user pages.  At the time of this writing,\
    \ this feature\n   was under development.\n"
- title: 3.  Working Group Process
  contents:
  - "3.  Working Group Process\n   [RFC8874] contains discussion of the different\
    \ possible ways that a\n   working group can use GitHub and the large number of\
    \ decisions\n   associated with doing so.  This section specifies a basic set\
    \ of\n   administrative policies for working groups to follow and the\n   administrative\
    \ support needed to carry out those policies.\n"
- title: 3.1.  Contributions
  contents:
  - "3.1.  Contributions\n   At a minimum, every repository created in a working group\n\
    \   organization needs to incorporate into its CONTRIBUTING file the\n   boilerplate\
    \ text at <https://trustee.ietf.org/license-for-open-\n   source-repositories.html>\
    \ from the IETF license file for open-source\n   repositories.  The CONTRIBUTING\
    \ file can contain other information as\n   well (see <https://github.com/ietf/repo-files/tree/master/\n\
    \   contributing-samples> for examples).\n   It would be useful if the user data\
    \ in the Datatracker could list (at\n   a minimum) the GitHub account of the user\
    \ so that their contributions\n   could be tracked more easily.\n   Some working\
    \ groups choose to have more than one draft in a\n   repository, particularly\
    \ for drafts that are tightly linked with\n   significant cross-references.  In\
    \ such a case, the README for the\n   repository needs to say so clearly, so that\
    \ a participant understands\n   that changes might be made to multiple drafts\
    \ at once.\n"
- title: 3.2.  Backing Up and Archiving GitHub Content
  contents:
  - "3.2.  Backing Up and Archiving GitHub Content\n   IETF working group mailing\
    \ lists are automatically backed up by the\n   IETF Secretariat, and the archives\
    \ are publicly available.  All\n   official interactions in a WG must be archived.\n\
    \   Working group GitHub content also needs to be backed up and publicly\n   archived.\
    \  This document specifies using the Git protocol\n   [git-protocol] itself for\
    \ both of these tasks.\n   Every IETF working group repository on GitHub will\
    \ have a mirror\n   repository of the same name on a server maintained by the\
    \ IETF\n   Secretariat.  Every hour, a service will use the \"git fetch\" command\n\
    \   on every GitHub repository that is being tracked.  The mirror\n   repository\
    \ will allow anyone to read the repository.\n   Note that this system will not\
    \ back up GitHub issues or pull\n   requests.  These should be backed up as well;\
    \ the GitHub API allows\n   for this.  The IETF Secretariat should back up those\
    \ at the same time\n   as it is backing up the GitHub repositories.\n   The steps\
    \ in Section 2.5 inform the IETF Secretariat which\n   repositories should be\
    \ backed up.  Working group chairs and area\n   directors should also be able\
    \ to request that the IETF Secretariat\n   back up additional repositories that\
    \ are related to IETF working\n   groups.\n"
- title: 4.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "4.  Security Considerations\n   An attacker who can change the contents of Internet-Drafts,\n\
    \   particularly late in a working group's process, can possibly cause\n   unnoticed\
    \ changes in protocols that are eventually adopted.\n   There is a risk of data\
    \ loss due to centralization of data in one\n   service.  This is recognized and\
    \ mitigated by the plan described in\n   Section 3.2.\n"
