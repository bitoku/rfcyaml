    \  defined in the original IPP URL Scheme [RFC3510], but this document\n   does
    not update or obsolete [RFC3510].\n   This document updates:\n   a) \"Internet
    Printing Protocol/1.1: Encoding and Transport\"\n      [RFC2910], by extending
    Section 4 (\"Encoding of Transport Layer\"),\n      Section 5 (\"IPP URL Scheme\");
    and Section 8.2 (\"Using IPP with\n      TLS\") to add the new standard URI scheme

    and Section 4.4.1\n      (\"printer-uri-supported\") to add the new standard URI
    scheme of\n      'ipps' for IPP Printers.\n   The following versions of IPP are
    currently defined:\n      a) 1.0 in [RFC2566] (obsolete);\n      b) 1.1 in [RFC2911];\n

    title: 1.1.  Structure of This Document
  - contents:
    - "1.2.  Rationale for This Document\n   The 'ipps' URI scheme was defined for
      the following reasons:\n   1) Some existing IPP Client and IPP Printer implementations
      of\n      \"Upgrading to TLS Within HTTP/1.1\" [RFC2817] are flawed and\n      unreliable,
      although this is not due to specification defects in\n      [RFC2817] itself.\n
      \  2) Some existing IPP Client and IPP Printer implementations of HTTP\n      upgrade
      [RFC2817] do not perform an upgrade at the beginning of\n      every HTTP [RFC7230]
      connection; instead, they only shift to\n      secure IPP for selected IPP operations
      (inherently dangerous\n      behavior on the same underlying TCP [RFC793] connection).\n
      \  3) IPP Printer server-mandated HTTP upgrade [RFC2817] can still lead\n      to
      exposure of IPP Client data if the Expect request header is not\n      used
      -- basically, the IPP Client can send its whole Print-Job\n      request before
      the IPP Printer has a chance to respond and say,\n      \"Wait!  You need to
      encrypt first!\".\n"

    \  PWG \"IPP Version 2.0 Second Edition (IPP/2.0 SE)\" [PWG5100.12].\n   When

    [RFC2911], a directory entry,\n      discovery info, a web page, etc.;\n   2)
    The IPP Client converts the 'ipps' URI to an 'https' URI [RFC7230]\n      (replacing

      in IPP exchanges, the 'ipps'\n   URI scheme MUST only be used:\n   a) To specify
      an absolute URI for IPP secure print services and their\n      associated network
      resources;\n   b) To specify the use of the abstract protocol defined in \"Internet\n

    title: 4.1.  Applicability of 'ipps' URI Scheme
  - contents:
    - "4.2.  Syntax of 'ipps' URI Scheme\n   The abstract protocol defined in [RFC2911]
      places a limit of 1023\n   octets (NOT characters) on the length of a URI.\n
      \  See:  \"Uniform Resource Identifier (URI): Generic Syntax\" [STD66].\n   Per
      PWG \"IPP Everywhere\" [PWG5100.14], for compatibility with\n   existing IPP
      implementations, IPP Printers SHOULD NOT generate 'ipp'\n   [RFC3510] or 'ipps'
      URI (or allow administrators to configure)\n   lengths above 255 octets, because
      many older IPP Client\n   implementations do not properly support these lengths.\n
      \  Per PWG \"IPP Everywhere\" [PWG5100.14], in IPP exchanges, 'ipps' URIs\n
      \  MUST be represented in absolute form.  Absolute URIs always begin\n   with
      a scheme name followed by a colon.  For definitive information\n   on URI syntax
      and semantics, see \"Uniform Resource Identifier (URI):\n   Generic Syntax and
      Semantics\" [STD66].  This specification adopts the\n   definitions of \"host\",
      \"port\", and \"query\" from [STD66].  This\n   specification adopts the definition
      of \"absolute-path\" from\n   [RFC7230].\n   The 'ipps' URI scheme syntax in
      ABNF [STD68] is defined as follows:\n   ipps-uri =\n       \"ipps:\" \"//\"
      host [ \":\" port ] [ absolute-path [ \"?\" query ]]\n   Per [RFC2910], if the
      port is empty or not given, then port 631 MUST\n   be used.\n   See:  Section
      4.3 (\"Associated Port for 'ipps' URI Scheme\") in this\n   document.\n   The
      semantics are that the identified resource (see [RFC7230]) is\n   located at
      the IPP secure print service listening for HTTPS\n   connections on that port
      of that host; and the Request-URI for the\n   identified resource is 'absolute-path'.\n
      \  Note:  The higher-level \"authority\" production is not imported from\n   [STD66],
      because it includes an optional \"userinfo\" component that\n   cannot be used
      in 'ipps' URIs.\n   Note:  The \"query\" production does not have defined semantics
      in IPP\n   and was never used in examples in the IPP/1.1 Encoding and Transport\n
      \  document [RFC2910] or the original IPP URL Scheme [RFC3510].  The\n   \"query\"
      is retained here for consistency, but IPP Clients SHOULD\n   avoid its use (because
      the semantics would be implementation\n   defined).\n   Note:  Per PWG \"IPP
      Everywhere\" [PWG5100.14], literal IPv4 or IPv6\n   addresses SHOULD NOT be
      used in 'ipps' URIs, because:\n   a) IP addresses are often changed after network
      device installation\n      (for example, based on DHCP reassignment after a
      power cycle);\n   b) IP addresses often don't map simply to security domains;\n
      \  c) IP addresses are difficult to validate with X.509 server\n      certificates
      (because they do not map to common name or alternate\n      name attributes);
      and\n   d) IP link local addresses are not \"portable\" due to link identity.\n
      \  Per [RFC2910], if the 'absolute-path' is not present in an IPP URI,\n   it
      MUST be given as \"/\" when used as a Request-URI for a resource\n   (see [RFC7230]).
      \ An 'ipps' URI is transformed into an 'https' URI by\n   replacing \"ipps:\"
      with \"https:\" and inserting port 631 (if an\n   explicit 'port' is not present
      in the original 'ipps' URI).\n   See:  Section 4.3 (\"Associated Port for 'ipps'
      URI Scheme\") in this\n   document.\n"

      well-known port 631, already\n   registered in [PORTREG] by [RFC2910].\n   Note:
      \ Per direction of the IESG, as described in [RFC2910], port 631\n   is used

      631 is used for both 'ipp' [RFC3510] and 'ipps' URIs,\n   which both refer to
      an IPP Printer or a network resource managed by\n   an IPP Printer.  IPP Printer
      implementors can refer to the CUPS\n   [CUPS] source code for an example of

      'ipps' URIs for IPP\n   Printers (for example, to be used as protocol elements
      in 'printer-\n   uri' operation attributes of Print-Job request messages):\n
      \      ipps://example.com/\n       ipps://example.com/ipp\n       ipps://example.com/ipp/faxout\n
      \      ipps://example.com/ipp/print\n       ipps://example.com/ipp/scan\n       ipps://example.com/ipp/print/bob\n
      \      ipps://example.com/ipp/print/ira\n   Note:  The use of an explicit 'ipp'
      path component followed by\n   explicit 'print', 'faxout', 'scan', or other
      standard or vendor\n   service component is best practice per [PWG5100.14],
      [PWG5100.15],\n   and [PWG5100.17].\n   Each of the above URIs is a well-formed
      URI for an IPP Printer and\n   each would reference a logically different IPP
      Printer, even though\n   some of those IPP Printers might share the same host
      system.  Note\n   that 'print' might represent some grouping of IPP Printers
      (for\n   example, a load-balancing spooler), while the 'bob' or 'ira' last\n
      \  path components might represent two different physical printer\n   devices,
      or 'bob' and 'ira' might represent separate human recipients\n   on the same
      physical printer device (for example, a physical printer\n   supporting two
      job queues).  Regardless, both 'bob' and 'ira' would\n   behave as different
      and independent IPP Printers.\n   The following are examples of well-formed
      'ipps' URIs for IPP\n   Printers with (optional) ports and paths:\n       ipps://example.com/\n
      \      ipps://example.com/ipp/print\n       ipps://example.com:631/ipp/print\n
      \  The first and second 'ipps' URIs above will be resolved to port 631\n   (IANA-assigned

    for the IPP Printer\n   \"printer-uri-supported\" attribute in the IANA IPP Registry
    [IPPREG],\n   per Section 6.2 (\"Attribute Extensibility\") of [RFC2911] as follows:\n
    \  IANA has registered the 'ipps' URI scheme using the following\n   template,
    which conforms to [BCP35].\n   URI scheme name:  ipps\n   Status:  Permanent\n
    \  URI scheme syntax:  See Section 4.2 of RFC 7472.\n   URI scheme semantics:
    \ The 'ipps' URI scheme is used to designate\n      secure IPP Printer objects
    (print spoolers, print gateways, print\n      devices, etc.) on Internet hosts
    accessible using the IPP enhanced\n      to support guaranteed data integrity
    and negotiable data privacy\n      using TLS [RFC5246] as specified in HTTP/1.1
    [RFC7230].\n   Encoding Considerations:  See Section 4.4 of RFC 7472.\n   Applications/protocols

    used by applications that need to access\n      secure IPP Printers using the
    IPP enhanced to support guaranteed\n      data integrity and negotiable data privacy
    using TLS [RFC5246] as\n      specified in HTTP/1.1 [RFC7230].  Such applications
    may include\n      (but are not limited to) IPP-capable web browsers, IPP Clients\n
    \     that wish to print a file, and servers (for example, print\n      spoolers)
    wishing to forward a Job for processing.\n   Interoperability Considerations:
    The widely deployed, open source IPP\n      print service CUPS [CUPS] (on most
    UNIX, Linux, and Apple OS X\n      systems) has supported 'ipps' URI for several
    years before the\n      publication of this document.  PWG \"IPP Everywhere\"
    [PWG5100.14]\n      (IPP secure, mobile printing extensions) requires the use
