- title: Abstract
  contents:
  - "Abstract\n   Several protocols allow the use of data representing different\n\
    \   \"media\" such as text, images, audio, and video, and within such media\n\
    \   different encoding styles, such as (in video) jpeg, gif, ief, and\n   tiff.\
    \  The Multimedia Internet Message Extensions (MIME) protocol [1]\n   defined\
    \ several initial types of multimedia data objects, and a\n   procedure for registering\
    \ additional types with the Internet Assigned\n   Numbers Authority (IANA).  Several\
    \ questions have been raised about\n   the requirements and administrative procedure\
    \ for registering MIME\n   content-type and subtypes, and the use of these Media\
    \ Types for other\n   applications.  This document addresses these issues and\
    \ specifies a\n   procedure for the registration of new Media Types (content-\n\
    \   type/subtypes).  It also generalizes the scope of use of these Media\n   Types\
    \ to make it appropriate to use the same registrations and\n   specifications\
    \ with other applications.\n"
- title: 1. Introduction
  contents:
  - "1. Introduction\n   RFC 1521 [1] defines a procedure for the registration of\
    \ new data\n   types for use with the Multimedia Internet Message Extensions (MIME).\n\
    \   This registration mechanism was designed to make the identifiers for\n   a\
    \ given data type available for use and to prevent naming conflicts.\n   With\
    \ the growth of new multi-media protocols and access mechanisms,\n   this process\
    \ has the promise of forming a unified general\n   registration service for Internet\
    \ Protocols.  These types, previously\n   called \"MIME Types\", are now called\
    \ \"Media Types\".\n   The registration process for Media Types (content-type/subtypes)\
    \ was\n   initially defined in the context of the asynchronous mail\n   environments.\
    \  In this mail environment, there is a need to limit the\n   number of possible\
    \ Media Types to increase the likelihood of\n   interoperability when the capabilities\
    \ of the remote mail system are\n   not known.  As Media Types are used in new\
    \ environments, where the\n   proliferation of Media Types is not a hindrance\
    \ to interoperability,\n   the original procedure is excessively restrictive and\
    \ needs to be\n   generalized.\n   This document addresses the specific questions\
    \ raised and provides an\n   administrative procedure for the registration of\
    \ Media Types.  This\n   procedure also address the registration requirements\
    \ needed for the\n   mapping of Object Identifiers (OIDs) for X.400 MHS use to\
    \ Media\n   Types.\n"
- title: 2. Media Type Registration Procedure
  contents:
  - "2. Media Type Registration Procedure\n   The following procedure has been implemented\
    \ by the IANA for review\n   and approval of new Media Types.  This is not a formal\
    \ standards\n   process, but rather an administrative procedure intended to allow\n\
    \   community comment and sanity checking without excessive time delay.\n"
- title: 2.1 Present the Request for Registration to the Community
  contents:
  - "2.1 Present the Request for Registration to the Community\n   Send a proposed\
    \ Media Type (content-type/subtype) to the \"ietf-\n   types@cs.utk.edu\" mailing\
    \ list.  This mailing list has been\n   established for the sole purpose of reviewing\
    \ proposed Media Types.\n   Proposed content-types are not formally registered\
    \ and must use the\n   \"x-\" notation for the subtype name.\n   The intent of\
    \ the public posting is to solicit comments and feedback\n   on the choice of\
    \ content-type/subtype name, the unambiguity of the\n   references with respect\
    \ to versions and external profiling\n   information, the choice of which OIDs\
    \ to use, and a review of the\n   security considerations section.  It should\
    \ be noted that the\n   proposed Media Type does not need to make sense for every\
    \ possible\n   application.  If the Media Type is intended for a limited or specific\n\
    \   use, this should be noted in the submission.\n"
- title: 2.2 Submit the Content Type to the IANA for Registration
  contents:
  - "2.2 Submit the Content Type to the IANA for Registration\n   After two weeks,\
    \ submit the proposed Media Type to the IANA for\n   registration.  The request\
    \ and supporting documentation should be\n   sent to \"iana@isi.edu\".  Provided\
    \ a reasonable review period has\n   elapsed, the IANA will register the Media\
    \ Type, assign an OID under\n   the IANA branch, and make the Media Type registration\
    \ available to\n   the community.\n   The Media Type registrations will be posted\
    \ in the anonymous FTP\n   directory \"ftp.isi.edu:in-notes/media-types\" and\
    \ the Media Type will\n   be listed in the periodically issued \"Assigned Numbers\"\
    \ RFC [2].  The\n   Media Type description may be published as an Informational\
    \ RFC by\n   sending it to \"rfc-editor@isi.edu\" (please follow the instructions\

- title: 3.1 MIME Requirements for a Limited Number of Content-Types
  contents:
  - "3.1 MIME Requirements for a Limited Number of Content-Types\n   Issue:  In the\
    \ asynchronous mail environment, where information on\n   the capabilities of\
    \ the remote mail agent is not available to the\n   sender, maximum interoperability\
    \ is attained by restricting the\n   number of content-types used to those \"\
    common\" content-types expected\n   to be widely implemented.  This was asserted\
    \ as a reason to limit the\n   number of possible content-types and resulted in\
    \ a registration\n   process with a significant hurdle and delay for those registering\n\
    \   content-types.\n   Comment:  The need for \"common\" content-types formats\
    \ does not\n   require limiting the registration of new content-types.  This\n\
    \   restriction may, in fact, hinder interoperability by causing separate\n  \
    \ registration authorities for specific applications which may register\n   values\
    \ in conflict with or otherwise incompatible with each other.\n   If a limited\
    \ set of content-types recommended for a particular\n   application, that should\
    \ be asserted by a separate applicability\n   statement specific for the application\
    \ and/or environment.\n"
- title: 3.2 Requirements for a Published Specification
  contents:
  - "3.2 Requirements for a Published Specification\n   Issue:  Content-Type registration\
    \ requires an RFC specifying the data\n   format or a reference to a published\
    \ specification of the data\n   stream.  This requirement may be overly restrictive\
    \ for the use of\n   content-type registration for file attachments and distribution\n\
    \   because a public specification may not be available for a number of\n   widely\
    \ used and exchanged objects.\n   Comment:  MIME required the documentation of\
    \ a specific content-type\n   to allow the unambiguous identification of a defined\
    \ type.  This\n   intent is met by the identification of a particular software\
    \ package\n   and version when registering the content-type and is allowed for\n\
    \   registration.  The appropriateness of using a Media Type with an\n   unavailable\
    \ specification should not be an issue in the registration.\n"
- title: 3.3 Identification of Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "3.3 Identification of Security Considerations\n   Issue:  The registration process\
    \ requires the identification of any\n   known security problems with the content-type.\n\
    \   Comment:  It is not required that the content-type be secure or that\n   it\
    \ be free from risks, but that the known risks be identified.\n   Publication\
    \ of a content-type does not require an exhaustive security\n   review, and the\
    \ security considerations section is subject to\n   continuing evaluation.  Additional\
    \ security considerations should be\n   periodically published in an RFC by IANA.\n"
- title: 3.4. Recommendations and Standards Status

  - "3.4. Recommendations and Standards Status\n   Issue:  The registration of a data\
    \ type does not imply endorsement,\n   approval, or recommendation by IANA or\
    \ IETF or even certification\n   that the specification is adequate.\n   Comment:\
    \ To become Internet Standards, protocol, data objects, or\n   whatever must go\
    \ through the IETF standards process.  This is too\n   difficult and to lengthly\
    \ a process for the convenient and practical\n   need to register Media Types.\
    \  It is expected that applicability\n   statements for particular applications\

- title: Appendix A -- IANA Registration Procedures for Media Types
  contents:
  - "Appendix A -- IANA Registration Procedures for Media Types\n   MIME has been\
    \ carefully designed to have extensible mechanisms, and\n   it is expected that\
    \ the set of content-type/subtype pairs and their\n   associated parameters will\
    \ grow significantly with time.  Several\n   other MIME fields, notably character\
    \ set names, access-type\n   parameters for the message/external-body type, and\
    \ possibly even\n   Content-Transfer-Encoding values, are likely to have new values\n\
    \   defined over time.\n   In general, parameters in the content-type header field\
    \ are used to\n   convey supplemental information for various content types, and\
    \ their\n   use is defined when the content-type and subtype are defined.  New\n\
    \   parameters should not be defined as a way to introduce new\n   functionality.\n\
    \   In order to ensure that the content-type and subtype (that is Media\n   Type)\
    \ values are developed in an orderly, well-specified, and public\n   manner, MIME\
    \ and other applications use the registration process for\n   Media Types defined\
    \ in this RFC which uses the Internet Assigned\n   Numbers Authority (IANA) as\
    \ a central registry for such values.\n   In order to simplify and standardize\
    \ this Media Type registration\n   process, this appendix gives templates for\
    \ the registration of new\n   values with IANA.  Each of these is given in the\
    \ form of an email\n   message template, to be filled in by the registering party.\n\
    \   Registration of New Content-type/subtype Values:\n   Note that MIME is generally\
    \ expected to be extended by subtypes.  If\n   a new fundamental top-level type\
    \ is needed, its specification must be\n   published as an RFC or submitted in\
    \ a form suitable to become an RFC,\n   and be subject to the Internet standards\
    \ process.\n      ==================================================================\n\
