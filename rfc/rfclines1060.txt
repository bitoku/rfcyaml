Most of the protocols mentioned here are documented in the RFC series of notes.
Some of the items listed are undocumented.
Further information on protocols can be found in the memo "Official Internet Protocols" [118].
The more prominent and more generally used are documented in the "DDN Protocol Handbook, Volume Two, DARPA Internet Protocols" [45] prepared by the NIC.
Other collections of older or obsolete protocols are contained in the "Internet Protocol Transition Workbook" [76], or in the "ARPANET Protocol Transition Handbook" [47].
For further information on ordering the complete 1985 DDN Protocol Handbook, write:
SRI International (SRI NIC), DDN Network Information Center, Room EJ291, 333 Ravenswood Avenue, Menlo Park, CA., 94025; or call: 1 800 235 3155.
Also, the Internet Activities Board (IAB) publishes the "IAB Official Protocol Standards" [62], which describes the state of standardization of protocols used in the Internet.
This document is issued quarterly.
Current copies may be obtained from the DDN Network Information Center or from the IANA.
In the entries below, the name and mailbox of the responsible individual is indicated.
The bracketed entry, e.g., [nn,iii], at the right hand margin of the page indicates a reference for the listed protocol, where the number ("nn") cites the document and the letters ("iii") cites the person.
Whenever possible, the letters are a NIC Ident as used in the WhoIs (NICNAME) service.
The convention in the documentation of Internet Protocols is to express numbers in decimal and to picture data in "big endian" order [21].
That is, fields are described left to right, with the most significant octet on the left and the least significant octet on the right.
The order of transmission of the header and data described in this document is resolved to the octet level.
Whenever a diagram shows a group of octets, the order of transmission of those octets is the normal order in which they are read in English.
For example, in the following diagram the octets are transmitted in the order they are numbered. 0
Whenever an octet represents a numeric quantity the left most bit in the diagram is the high order or most significant bit.
That is, the bit labeled 0 is the most significant bit.
For example, the following diagram represents the value 170 (decimal).
1 2 3 4 5 6 7    1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0    Significance of Bits Similarly, whenever a multi octet field represents a numeric quantity the left most bit of the whole field is the most significant bit.
When a multi octet quantity is transmitted the most significant octet is transmitted first.
: There are five classes of IP addresses:  Class A through Class E [119].
Of these, Class D and Class E addresses are reserved for experimental use.
A gateway which is not participating in these experiments must ignore all datagrams with a Class D or Class E destination IP address.
ICMP Destination Unreachable or ICMP Redirect messages must not result from receiving such datagrams.
There are certain special cases for IP addresses [11].
<Subnet number>, <Host number> }
if we also use the notation " 1" to mean the field contains all 1 bits.
Some common special cases are as follows:
This host on this network.
Can only be used as a source address (see note later).
Can only be used as a source address.
{  1,  1} Limited broadcast.
Can only be used as a destination address, and a datagram with this address must never be forwarded outside the (sub )net of the source.
} Directed broadcast to specified network.
Can only be used as a destination address.
{<Network number>, <Subnet number>,  1
} Directed broadcast to specified subnet.
Can only be used as a destination address.
} Directed broadcast to all subnets of specified subnetted network.
Can only be used as a destination address.
{127, <any>} Internal host loopback address.
Should never appear outside a host.
In the Internet Protocol (IP)
[45,105] there is a field to identify the version of the internetwork general protocol.
This field is 4 bits in size.
In the Internet Protocol (IP)
[45,105] there is a field, called Protocol, to identify the the next level protocol.
This is an 8 bit field.
PORT NUMBERS Ports are used in the TCP [45,106] to name the ends of logical connections which carry long term conversations.
For the purpose of providing services to unknown callers, a service contact port is defined.
This list specifies the port used by the server process as its contact port.
The contact port is sometimes called the "well known port".
To the extent possible, these same port assignments are used with the UDP [46,104].
To the extent possible, these same port assignments are used with the ISO TP4 [64].
The assigned ports use a small portion of the possible port numbers.
The assigned ports have all except the low order eight bits cleared to zero.
The low order eight bits are specified here.
SWIFT RVF  Swift Remote Vitural File Protocol
NETBIOS SSN NETBIOS Session Service
By convention, ports in the range 256 to 1024 are used for "Unix Standard" services.
Listed here are some of the normal uses of these port numbers.

/udp INTERNET MULTICAST ADDRESSES Host Extensions for IP Multicasting (RFC 1112)
[43] specifies the extensions required of a host implementation of the Internet Protocol (IP) to support multicasting.
Current addresses are listed below.
All Gateways on this Subnet (proposed)
See the next section on "IANA ETHERNET ADDRESS BLOCK".
The IANA owns an Ethernet address block which may be used for multicast address asignments or other special purposes.
The address block in IEEE binary is (which is in bit transmission order):
0000 0000 0000 0111 1010
In the normal Internet dotted decimal notation this is 0.0.94 since the bytes are transmitted higher order first and bits within bytes are transmitted lower order first (see "Data Notation" in the Introduction).
IEEE CSMA/CD and Token Bus bit transmission order: 00 00 5E IEEE Token Ring bit transmission order: 00 00
Assigned by IANA for other uses Appearance in memory (bits transmitted right to left within octets, octets transmitted left to right):
Assigned by IANA for other uses
The latter representation corresponds to the Internet standard bit  order, and is the format that most programmers have to deal with.
Using this representation, the range of Internet Multicast addresses is: 01 00 5E 00 00 00  to  01 00 5E 7F FF FF  in hex, or 1.0.94.0.0.0  to  1.0.94.127.255.255  in dotted decimal IP TOS PARAMETERS
This documents the default Type of Service values that are currently recommended for the most important Internet protocols.
There are three binary TOS attributes: low delay, high throughput, and high reliability; in each case, an attribute bit is turned on to indicate "better".
The three attributes cannot all be optimized simultanously, and in fact the TOS algorithms that have been discussed tend to make "better" values of the attributes mutually exclusive.
Therefore, the recommended values have at most one bit on.
Generally, protocols which are involved in direct interaction with a human should select low delay, while data transfers which may involve large blocks of data are need high throughput.
Finally, high reliability is most important for datagram based Internet management functions.
Application protocols not included in these tables should be able to make appropriate choice of low delay (1 0 0) or high throughput (0 1 0).
The following are recommended values for TOS:   Type of Service Value   Low
Domain Name Service UDP Query
(1)  Includes all interactive user protocols (e.g., rlogin).
(2)  Includes all bulk data transfer protocols (e.g., rcp).
If the implementation does not support changing the TOS during the lifetime of the connection, then the recommended TOS on opening the connection is (0,0,0).
The current recommended default TTL for the Internet Protocol
(IP) RFC 791 [45,105] is 32.
The Internet Domain Naming System (DOMAIN) includes several parameters.
These are documented in RFC 1034, [81] and RFC 1035 [82].
The CLASS parameter is listed here.
The per CLASS parameters are defined in separate RFCs as indicated.
RFC 951 [36] describes an IP/UDP bootstrap protocol (BOOTP) which allows a diskless client machine to discover its own IP address, the address of a server host, and the name of a file to be loaded into memory and executed.
The BOOTP Vendor Information Extensions RFC 1084 [117] proposes an addition to the Bootstrap Protocol (BOOTP).
Vendor Extensions are listed below:
For the management of hosts and gateways on the Internet a data structure for the information has been defined.
This data structure should be used with any of several possible management protocols, such as the "Simple Network Management Protocol" (SNMP) RFC 1098 [15], or the "Common Management Information Protocol over TCP" (CMOT) [142].
The data structure is the "Structure and Indentification of Management Information for TCP/IP based Internets" (SMI) RFC 1065 [120], and the "Management Information Base for Network Management of TCP/IP based Internets" (MIB) [121].
The SMI includes the provision for parameters or codes to indicate experimental or private data structures.
These parameter assignments are listed here.
The older "Simple Gateway Monitoring Protocol" (SGMP)
RFC 1028 [37] also defined a data structure.
The parameter assignments used with SGMP are included here for hist orical completeness.
SMI Network Management Experimental Codes: Prefix: 1.3.6.1.3.
[MTR] SMI Network Management Private Enterprise Codes: Prefix: 1.3.6.1.4.1.

[JKR1] ARPANET AND MILNET LOGICAL ADDRESSES
The ARPANET facility for "logical addressing" is described in RFC 878 [57] and RFC 1005 [109].
A portion of the possible logical addresses are reserved for standard uses.
There are 49,152 possible logical host addresses.
Of these, 256 are reserved for assignment to well known functions.
Assignments for well known functions are made by the IANA.
Assignments for other logical host addresses are made by the NIC.
[JBP] ARPANET AND MILNET LINK
The word "link" here refers to a field in the original ARPANET Host/IMP interface leader.
The link was originally defined as an 8  bit field.
Later specifications defined this field as the "message  id" with a length of 12 bits.
The name link now refers to the high order 8 bits of this 12 bit message
The Host/IMP interface is defined in BBN Report 1822 [2].
The low order 4 bits of the message
id field are called the sub link.
Unless explicitly specified otherwise for a particular protocol, there is no sender to receiver significance to the sub link.
The sender may use the sub link in any way he chooses (it is returned in the RFNM by the destination IMP), the receiver should ignore the sub link.
All MILNET hosts are assigned addresses by the Defense Data Network (DDN).
The address of a MILNET host may be obtained from the Network Information Center (NIC), represented as an ASCII text string in what is called "host table format".
This section describes the process by which MILNET X.25 addresses may be derived from addresses in the NIC host table format.
A NIC host table address consists of the ASCII text string representations of four decimal numbers separated by periods, corresponding to the four octeted of a thirty two bit Internet address.
The four decimal numbers are referred to in this section as "n", "h' "l", and "i".
Thus, a host table address may be represented as: "n.h.l.i".
Each of these four numbers will have either one, two, or three decimal digits and will never have a value greater than 255.
For example, in the host table, address: "10.2.0.124", n 10, h 2, l 0, and i 124.
To convert a host table address to a MILNET X.25 address: 1.
If h < 64, the host table address corresponds to the X.25 physical address: ZZZZ F IIIHHZZ (SS)
In the example given above, the host table address 10.2.0.124 corresponds to the X.25 physical address 000001240200.
If h > 64 or
h   64, the host table address corresponds to the X.25 logical address
(Note that the decimal representation of "r" will always require five digits);
Thus, the host table address 10.83.0.207 corresponds to the X.25 logical address 000012145500.
In both cases, the "n" and "l" fields of the host table address are not used.
IEEE 802 NUMBERS OF INTEREST
Some of the networks of all classes are IEEE 802 Networks.
These systems may use a Link Service Access Point (LSAP) field in much the same way the ARPANET uses the "link" field.
Further, there is an extension of the LSAP header called the Sub Network Access Protocol (SNAP).
The IEEE likes to describe numbers in binary in bit transmission order, which is the opposite of the big endian order used throughout the Internet protocol documentation.
Assignments: Link Service Access Point
These numbers (and others) are assigned by the IEEE Standards Office.
The address is: IEEE Standards Office, 345 East 47th Street, New York, N.Y. 10017,
At an ad hoc special session on "IEEE 802 Networks and ARP", held during the TCP Vendors Workshop (August 1986), an approach to a consistent way to send DoD IP datagrams and other IP related protocols (such as the Address Resolution Protocol (ARP)) on 802 networks was developed, using the SNAP extension (see RFC 1010 and RFC 1042 [90]).
Many of the networks of all classes are Ethernets (10Mb) or Experimental Ethernets (3Mb).
These systems use a message "type" field in much the same way the ARPANET uses the "link" field.
If you need an Ethernet type, contact the Xerox Corporation, Xerox Systems Institute, 475 Oakmead Parkway, Sunnyvale, CA 94086,

The standard for transmission of IP datagrams over Ethernets and Experimental Ethernets is specified in RFC 894 [61] and RFC 895 [91] respectively.
Ethernet 48 bit address blocks are assigned by the IEEE.
IEEE Standards Office, 345 East 47th Street, New York, N.Y. 10017,
ETHERNET VENDOR ADDRESS COMPONENTS Ethernet hardware addresses are 48 bits, expressed as 12 hexadecimal digits (0 9, plus A F, capitalized).
These 12 hex digits consist of the first/left 6 digits (which should match the vendor of the Ethernet interface within the station) and the last/right 6 digits which specify the interface serial number for that interface vendor.
Ethernet addresses might be written unhyphenated (e.g., 123456789ABC), or with one hyphen (e.g., 123456 789ABC), but should be written hyphenated by octets (e.g., 12 34 56 78 9A BC).
These addresses are physical station addresses, not multicast nor broadcast, so the second hex digit (reading from the left) will be even, not odd.
At present, it is not clear how the IEEE assigns Ethernet block addresses.
Whether in blocks of 2  24 or 2  25, and whether multicasts are assigned with that block or separately.
A portion of the vendor block address is reportedly assigned serially, with the other portion intentionally assigned randomly.
If there is a global algorithm for which addresses are designated to be physical (in a chipset) versus logical (assigned in software), or globally assigned versus locally assigned addresses, some of the known addresses do not follow the scheme (e.g., AA0003; 02xxxx).

Below is the current list of PRONET 80 Type Numbers.
a protocol that is on this list does not necessarily mean that there is any implementation of it on ProNET.
Of these, protocols 1, 14, and 20 are the only ones that have ever been seen in ARP packets.
For reference, the header is (one byte/line): destination hardware address source hardware address data link header version (2) data link header protocol number data link header reserved (0) data link header reserved (0)
Some protocols have been known to tuck stuff in the reserved fields.
