- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   This memo defines a set of objects for managing World Wide\
    \ Web (WWW)\n   services. This MIB extends the application management framework\n\
    \   defined by the System Application Management MIB (SYSAPPL-MIB) [23]\n   and\
    \ the Application Management MIB (APPLICATION-MIB) [24]. The MIB is\n   also self-contained\
    \ so that it can be implemented and used without\n   having to implement or install\
    \ the APPLICATION-MIB or the SYSAPPL-\n   MIB.\n   The protocol statistics defined\
    \ in the WWW Service MIB are based on\n   an abstract document transfer protocol\
    \ (DTP). This memo also defines\n   a mapping of the abstract DTP to HTTP and\
    \ FTP.  Additional mappings\n   may be defined in the future in order to use this\
    \ MIB with other\n   document transfer protocols. It is anticipated that such\
    \ future\n   mappings will be defined in separate RFCs.\n   The key words \"MUST\"\
    , \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD\
    \ NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n   document are to\
    \ be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [17].\n"
- title: 2.  The SNMP Management Framework
  contents:
  - "2.  The SNMP Management Framework\n   The SNMP Management Framework presently\
    \ consists of five major\n   components:\n    o   An overall architecture, described\
    \ in RFC 2571 [1].\n    o   Mechanisms for describing and naming objects and events\
    \ for the\n        purpose of management. The first version of this Structure\
    \ of\n        Management Information (SMI) is called SMIv1 and described in\n\
    \        STD 16, RFC 1155 [2], STD 16, RFC 1212 [3] and RFC 1215 [4]. The\n  \
    \      second version, called SMIv2, is described in STD 58, RFC 2578\n      \
    \  [5], RFC 2579 [6] and RFC 2580 [7].\n    o   Message protocols for transferring\
    \ management information. The\n        first version of the SNMP message protocol\
    \ is called SNMPv1 and\n        described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [8]. A second version\
    \ of the SNMP\n        message protocol, which is not an Internet standards track\n\
    \        protocol, is called SNMPv2c and described in RFC 1901 [9] and\n     \
    \   RFC 1906 [10]. The third version of the message protocol is\n        called\
    \ SNMPv3 and described in RFC 1906 [10], RFC 2572 [11] and\n        RFC 2574 [12].\n\
    \    o   Protocol operations for accessing management information. The\n     \
    \   first set of protocol operations and associated PDU formats is\n        described\
    \ in RFC 1157 [8]. A second set of protocol operations\n        and associated\
    \ PDU formats is described in RFC 1905 [13].\n    o   A set of fundamental applications\
    \ described in RFC 2573 [14] and\n        the view-based access control mechanism\
    \ described in RFC 2575\n        [15].\n   Managed objects are accessed via a\
    \ virtual information store, termed\n   the Management Information Base or MIB.\
    \  Objects in the MIB are\n   defined using the mechanisms defined in the SMI.\n\
    \   This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2. A\n   MIB\
    \ conforming to the SMIv1 can be produced through the appropriate\n   translations.\
    \ The resulting translated MIB must be semantically\n   equivalent, except where\
    \ objects or events are omitted because no\n   translation is possible (use of\
    \ Counter64). Some machine readable\n   information in SMIv2 will be converted\
    \ into textual descriptions in\n   SMIv1 during the translation process. However,\
    \ this loss of machine\n   readable information is not considered to change the\
    \ semantics of the\n   MIB.\n"
- title: 3.  Terminology
  contents:
  - "3.  Terminology\n   This section defines the terminology used throughout this\
    \ document.\n   o    The 'World Wide Web' (WWW) is a world wide information system\n\
    \        which is based on the concept of documents that are linked\n        together\
    \ by embedding references (links) to other local or\n        remote documents.\n\
    \   o    A 'document' is a coherent piece of data which is accessible in\n   \
    \     the World Wide Web. No assumptions are made about the content or\n     \
    \   the type of a document.\n   o    A 'Uniform Resource Locator' (URL) is a formatted\
    \ string\n        representation for a document available via the Internet. URLs\n\
    \        are used to express references between documents. For the syntax\n  \
    \      and semantics of the URL string representation refer to RFC 2396\n    \
    \    [18]\n   o    A 'Document Transfer Protocol' (DTP) is a protocol used within\n\
    \        the World Wide Web to invoke actions on documents. The DTP is an\n  \
    \      abstraction from real protocols, such as HTTP [19,20] or FTP\n        [21].\n\
    \   o    A 'request' is a DTP protocol operation which is targeted to a\n    \
    \    'document' and invokes an action on the target document.  The\n        request\
    \ type specifies the action that should be performed. A\n        request can have\
    \ a document associated with it.\n   o    A 'response' is a DTP protocol operation\
    \ which is returned as a\n        result of a previous (and associated) request.\
    \ The response\n        status indicates if the requested action was successful\
    \ or if\n        errors occurred. A response can have a document associated with\n\
    \        it.\n   o    A 'WWW service' is a set of actions that can be invoked\
    \ on a\n        document. Typical actions are the transfer of documents or the\n\
    \        retrieval of administrative information about documents. WWW\n      \
    \  services are provided by means of a DTP. A WWW service can be\n        identified\
    \ by the DTP protocol used to invoke services and the\n        transport endpoint\
    \ used by that protocol.\n   o    A 'client' is a program which establishes connections\
    \ for the\n        purpose of sending requests and receiving responses.\n   o\
    \    A 'server' is a program that accepts connections in order to\n        service\
    \ requests by sending back responses.\n   o    A 'proxy' is an intermediary program\
    \ which acts as both a server\n        and a client for the purpose of making\
    \ requests on behalf of\n        other clients.  Requests are serviced internally\
    \ or by passing\n        them on, with possible translation, to other servers.\n\
    \   o    A 'caching proxy' is a proxy with the capability of locally\n       \
    \ storing responses to associated requests. A caching proxy can\n        respond\
    \ to similar requests with a previously stored response.\n"
- title: 4.  Overview
  contents:
  - "4.  Overview\n   The World Wide Web (WWW) is a global network of information.\n\
    \   Information is stored in documents, which can have various formats,\n   including\
    \ hyper-text and multi-media documents. Access to these\n   documents is provided\
    \ by servers which are located all around the\n   world and are linked to each\
    \ other via hyper-links embedded in\n   documents.\n   The usability of the World\
    \ Wide Web depends largely on the\n   performance of the services realized by\
    \ these servers. The services\n   are typically monitored through log files. This\
    \ becomes a difficult\n   task when a single organization is responsible for a\
    \ large number of\n   services. It is therefore desirable to treat WWW services\
    \ as objects\n   that can be managed by using the Internet network management\n\
    \   framework [22].\n"
- title: 4.1.  Purpose and Requirements
  contents:
  - "4.1.  Purpose and Requirements\n   The goal of this MIB is to define a standardized\
    \ set of objects which\n   lead to integrated and improved performance and fault\
    \ management in a\n   heterogeneous environment of WWW services. This MIB focuses\
    \ on the\n   service-oriented view. It does not deal with the process oriented\n\
    \   view, which is covered by the System Application MIB [23] and the\n   Application\
    \ MIB [24].\n   This document defines a set of managed objects to monitor WWW\n\
    \   services for short-term operational purposes, such as problem\n   detection\
    \ and troubleshooting. No attempts are made here to cover\n   accounting or hit\
    \ metering issues.\n   The scope of the MIB is further limited by the requirement\
    \ that an\n   implementation conforming to this MIB must be possible without\n\
    \   putting a huge CPU or memory burden on the WWW server implementation.\n  \
    \ In addition, this MIB does not cover WWW service configuration.\n   Server software\
    \ has become an open market where competing vendors\n   constantly invent new\
    \ features in order to shape their products. It\n   is therefore not possible\
    \ to reach consensus on a common way to\n   configure WWW services at this point\
    \ in time.\n"
- title: 4.2.  Relationship to other Standards Efforts
  contents:
  - "4.2.  Relationship to other Standards Efforts\n   The WWW Service MIB fits into\
    \ the application management architecture\n   defined in the System Application\
    \ MIB [23]. The System Application\n   MIB and the Application MIB [24] use a\
    \ process-oriented view, where\n   an application is viewed as a collection of\
    \ processes. The WWW\n   Service MIB described in this memo uses a service-oriented\
    \ view,\n   which looks at the services provided by a set of processes.\n   The\
    \ relationship between the process-oriented view and the service-\n   oriented\
    \ view is a many-to-many relationship, because one process can\n   implement multiple\
    \ services and multiple services can be implemented\n   by a single set of processes.\
    \ The Application Management MIB [24]\n   contains generic mapping tables, which\
    \ map back and forth between\n   both views.\n   The WWW Service MIB interfaces\
    \ to the Application MIB [24] by using\n   the service instance identifier (applSrvIndex)\
    \ for wwwServiceIndex if\n   an applicable instance of applSrvIndex is available.\
    \ The WWW Service\n   MIB is self-contained and can be implemented as a stand-alone\
    \ module\n   if the service-level tables in the Application MIB are not available.\n"
- title: 4.3.  WWW Services
  contents:
  - "4.3.  WWW Services\n   The MIB is organized around the concept of WWW services.\
    \ WWW services\n   are a set of actions that can be invoked on a document. A WWW\
    \ service\n   is provided or used by either a client, a server or a proxy. Clients\n\
    \   send out requests for information to server or proxy server. Servers\n   receive,\
    \ process and respond to requests received from clients.\n   Servers usually have\
    \ access to local documents, which can be\n   transferred to clients.\n   A proxy\
    \ is a special server, who acts as both a server and a client\n   for the purpose\
    \ of making requests on behalf of other clients. A\n   proxy is able to translate\
    \ between the client and the origin server.\n   A proxy might also interact with\
    \ other information retrieval system,\n   like for example databases.\n   The\
    \ MIB defined in this memo distinguishes between outgoing and\n   incoming requests\
    \ and responses. This makes it possible to obtain\n   statistics for clients,\
    \ servers and proxies with a single set of\n   objects.\n   A special proxy server\
    \ is the caching proxy, which maintains a cache\n   of previously received documents\
    \ in order to reduce the bandwidth\n   used by World Wide Web clients. One interesting\
    \ piece of management\n   information is the percentage of requests that were\
    \ served from the\n   cache of the caching proxy (hits/miss-ratio). This ratio\
    \ is not\n   contained explicitly in this MIB. Instead, the ratio can be derived\n\
    \   from the objects that count incoming and outgoing requests and\n   responses.\n"
- title: 4.4.  Document Transfer Protocol
  contents:
  - "4.4.  Document Transfer Protocol\n   The MIB is based on the concept of an abstract\
    \ document transfer\n   protocol (DTP). The purpose of the abstract document transfer\n\
    \   protocol is to make the MIB definitions independent from concrete\n   protocols,\
    \ like the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) [19,20] or the\n   File Transfer\
    \ Protocol (FTP) [21].\n   The abstract document transfer protocol makes the following\n\
    \   assumptions about a concrete transfer protocol:\n   o    The transfer protocol\
    \ uses a request/response style of\n        interactions.\n   o    Every request\
    \ contains a request type, which defines the\n        operations performed by\
    \ the receiving server. The request type\n        is represented by an OCTET STRING.\
    \ It might be necessary to\n        define a translation into an OCTET STRING\
    \ value for protocols\n        that use numbers to identify request types.\n \
    \  o    A response contains a status code, which indicates if the\n        request\
    \ was processed successfully or which error occurred. The\n        status code\
    \ is represented as an INTEGER value. It might be\n        necessary to define\
    \ a mapping for protocols that do not use an\n        INTEGER status code.\n \
    \  o    A transfer protocol can send multiple responses for a single\n       \
    \ request.  Multiple responses are counted separately in the\n        protocol\
    \ statistics group.\n        A primary response has to be identified for the document\n\
    \        statistics. The primary response is the response that indicates\n   \
    \     whether the request was successful.\n   Section 7 of this memo defines a\
    \ mapping of the document transfer\n   protocol to the HTTP protocol and the FTP\
    \ protocol. Mappings to other\n   protocols, like NNTP [25] or WebNFS [26,27]\
    \ might be defined in the\n   future.\n"
- title: 5.  Structure of the MIB
  contents:
  - "5.  Structure of the MIB\n   This section presents the structure of the MIB.\
    \ The objects are\n   arranged into the following groups:\n   o    service information\n\
    \   o    protocol statistics\n   o    document statistics\n"
- title: 5.1.  Service Information Group
  contents:
  - "5.1.  Service Information Group\n   The service information group consists of\
    \ a single table describing\n   all the WWW services managed by the SNMP agent.\
    \ The service table\n   contains administrative network management information\
    \ for\n   (potentially) multiple WWW services running on a single host. It also\n\
    \   contains information for all services within virtual domains of a\n   host.\
    \ The columnar objects in the table can be divided into two main\n   groups:\n\
    \   o    global administrative information of the service, such as\n        service\
    \ contact person, and\n   o    network information, such as the transfer protocol.\n"
- title: 5.2.  Protocol Statistics Group
  contents:
  - "5.2.  Protocol Statistics Group\n   The protocol statistics group provides network\
    \ management information\n   about the traffic received or transmitted by a WWW\
    \ service. This\n   group contains counters related to DTP protocol operations\
    \ and\n   consists of five tables:\n   o    The wwwSummaryTable contains a set\
    \ of network traffic related\n        counters. The table provides a summarization\
    \ of the network\n        traffic and protocol operations related to a WWW service.\
    \ It is\n        well recognized that certain variables are redundant with\n \
    \       respect to the request and response tables, but they are added\n     \
    \   to provide an operator a quick overview and to reduce SNMP\n        network\
    \ traffic.\n   o    The wwwRequestInTable contains detailed information about\n\
    \        incoming requests. Every particular request type is counted\n       \
    \ separately.\n   o    The wwwRequestOutTable contains detailed information about\n\
    \        outgoing requests. Every particular request type is counted\n       \
    \ separately.\n   o    The wwwResponseInTable contains detailed information about\n\
    \        incoming responses. Every particular response type is counted\n     \
    \   separately.\n   o    The wwwResponseOutTable contains detailed information\
    \ about\n        outgoing responses. Every particular response type is counted\n\
    \        separately.\n"
- title: 5.3.  Document Statistics Group
  contents:
  - "5.3.  Document Statistics Group\n   The document group contains information about\
    \ the documents which\n   were accessed in the past. The group provides four types\
    \ of\n   statistics.\n   1.   Details about the last N attempts to invoke actions\
    \ on\n        documents.\n   2.   The Top N documents sorted by the number of\
    \ actions invoked on\n        them computed over a time interval.\n   3.   The\
    \ Top N documents sorted by the number of content bytes\n        transferred computed\
    \ over a time interval.\n   4.   Summary statistics computed over a time interval.\n\
    \   The Top N document statistics are collected in buckets in order to\n   reduce\
    \ agent resources and to allow a manager to detect changes in\n   the service\
    \ usage pattern. Buckets are filled over a configurable\n   time interval. The\
    \ agent computes the Top N statistics and starts a\n   new bucket once the time\
    \ interval for the bucket has passed. The time\n   interval is configurable for\
    \ each WWW service.\n   The document statistics group associates a response type\
    \ to the\n   request which invoked an action. In case a DTP sends multiple\n \
    \  responses, the primary response must be used to derive the response\n   type\
    \ of the request/response interaction.\n   The group consist of the following\
    \ tables:\n   o    The wwwDocCtrlTable provides the manager a means to limit the\n\
    \        document statistic tables in size and to control the expiration\n   \
    \     and creation of buckets.\n   o    The wwwDocLastNTable provides the manager\
    \ information about the\n        last N documents which where accessed. The table\
    \ lists the\n        documents for which access was attempted along with the request\n\
    \        and response type of the DTP and a status message. The request\n    \
    \    and response types provide a manager information of how attempts\n      \
    \  to invoke actions were handled by the DTP. The status message\n        object\
    \ provides human readable text to further describe the\n        response type.\n\
    \        The number of documents in the wwwDocLastNTable is controlled by\n  \
    \      the wwwDocCtrlLastNSize object in the wwwDocCtrlTable. The\n        wwwDocCtrlLastNLock\
    \ object of the wwwDocCtrlTable allows a\n        management application to lock\
    \ the wwwDocLastNTable in order to\n        retrieve a consistent snapshot of\
    \ the fast changing\n        wwwDocLastNTable.\n   o    The wwwDocBucketTable\
    \ lists the buckets of statistical\n        information that have been collected.\
    \ An entry in the\n        wwwDocBucketTable contains the creation timestamp of\
    \ the bucket\n        as well as summary information (number of accesses, number\
    \ of\n        documents accessed and number of bytes transferred).\n        The\
    \ time interval is controlled by the\n        wwwDocCtrlBucketTimeInterval object\
    \ of the wwwDocCtrlTable. The\n        maximum number of buckets maintained by\
    \ the SNMP agent for a\n        particular WWW service is controlled by the wwwDocCtrlBuckets\n\
    \        object of the wwwDocCtrlTable.\n   o    The wwwDocAccessTopNTable provides\
    \ the manager an overview of\n        the top N documents which were accessed\
    \ while statistics were\n        collected for a particular bucket. The wwwDocAccessTopNTable\
    \ is\n        sorted by the number of read attempts per document. The maximum\n\
    \        number of entries in the wwwDocAccessTopNTable is controlled by\n   \
    \     the wwwDocCtrlTopNSize object.\n   o    The wwwDocBytesTopNTable provides\
    \ the manager an overview of the\n        top N documents which caused most of\
    \ the network traffic while\n        statistics were collected for a particular\
    \ bucket. The\n        wwwDocBytesTopNTable is sorted by the number of bytes\n\
    \        transferred. The maximum number of entries in the\n        wwwDocBytesTopNTable\
    \ is controlled by the wwwDocCtrlTopNSize\n        object.\n   The Top N statistics\
    \ and the parameters of the underlying bucket are\n   not visible in the MIB as\
    \ long as the bucket is filling up. Instead,\n   the following steps must be taken\
    \ when the time interval for a\n   buckets has passed:\n   1.   A new entry in\
    \ the wwwDocBucketTable is created to summarize the\n        document statistics\
    \ for that time interval.\n   2.   The corresponding entries in the wwwDocAccessTopNTable\
    \ and the\n        wwwDocBytesTopNTable are computed and made available.\n   3.\
    \   If the resulting number of entries in the wwwDocBucketTable for\n        the\
    \ WWW service now exceeds wwwDocCtrlBuckets, then the oldest\n        bucket for\
    \ this WWW service and all corresponding entries in the\n        wwwDocBucketTable,\
    \ wwwDocAccessTopNTable, and\n        wwwDocBytesTopNTable are deleted.\n   Note\
    \ that a bucket usually contains much more data than displayed in\n   the Top\
    \ N tables. The number of entries in the Top N table for a\n   bucket is controlled\
    \ by wwwDocCtrlTopNSize, while the number of\n   entries in a bucket depends on\
    \ the number of actions invoked on\n   documents within the time interval over\
    \ which a bucket is filled up.\n   It is therefore suggested to discard the data\
    \ associated with a\n   bucket once the entries for the wwwDocBucketTable,\n \
    \  wwwDocAccessTopNTable and wwwDocBytesTopNTable have been calculated.\n"

  contents:
  - "7.  Document Transfer Protocol Mappings\n   This section describes how existing\
    \ protocols such as HTTP [19,20]\n   and FTP [21] can be mapped on the abstract\
    \ Document Transfer Protocol\n   (DTP) used within the definitions of the WWW\
    \ MIB. Every mapping must\n   define the identifier which is used to uniquely\
    \ identify the transfer\n   protocol. In addition, the mappings must define how\
    \ requests and\n   responses are identified.\n"
- title: 7.1.  The HyperText Transfer Protocol
  contents:
  - "7.1.  The HyperText Transfer Protocol\n   The HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP)\
    \ [19,20] is an application-\n   level protocol used to transfer hypermedia documents\
    \ in a distributed\n   networked environment. HTTP is based on the request/response\
    \ paradigm\n   and can be mapped on the abstract DTP easily.\n   The HTTP protocol\
    \ usually runs over TCP and uses the well-known TCP\n   port 80. Therefore, the\
    \ default value for the wwwServiceProtocol\n   object is { applTCPProtoID 80 }.\n\
    \   HTTP allows for both requests and responses and an open-ended set of\n   message\
    \ types. The general message syntax of HTTP is therefore used\n   for the protocol\
    \ mapping. The BNF specification of the general HTTP\n   message syntax as defined\
    \ in [20] is as follows:\n       generic-message = start-line\n              \
    \           *message-header\n                         CRLF\n                 \
    \        [ message-body ]\n       start-line   = Request-Line | Status-Line\n\
    \       Request-Line = Method SP Request-URI SP HTTP-Version CRLF\n       Status-Line\
    \  = HTTP-Version SP Status-Code SP Reason-Phrase CRLF\n   Every HTTP-message\
    \ where the start-line is a Request-Line is\n   considered a request in the abstract\
    \ DTP. Every HTTP-message where\n   the start-line is a Status-Line is considered\
    \ a response in the\n   abstract DTP. The mappings of WwwRequestType and WwwResponseType\
    \ are\n   defined as follows:\n   o    The WwwRequestType corresponds to the method\
    \ token in the\n        Request-Line.\n   o    The WwwResponseType corresponds\
    \ to the Status-Code in the\n        Status-Line.\n"
- title: 7.2.  The File Transfer Protocol
  contents:
  - "7.2.  The File Transfer Protocol\n   The File Transfer Protocol (FTP) [21] is\
    \ an application-level\n   protocol used to transfer files between hosts connected\
    \ by the TCP/IP\n   suite of protocols. FTP is based on a request/response paradigm\
    \ and\n   is mapped on the abstract DTP as defined in this section. The FTP\n\
    \   model as defined in [21] is depicted below.\n                            \

    \  FTP uses two different connection types between a client and a server\n   to\
    \ transfer files. The control connection is persistent during a FTP\n   session\
    \ and used to exchange FTP commands and associated replies. The\n   data connection\
    \ is only available when bulk data has to be\n   transferred.\n   The FTP protocol\
    \ usually runs over TCP and uses the well-known TCP\n   port 21 to setup the control\
    \ connection. Therefore, the default value\n   for the wwwServiceProtocol object\
    \ is { applTCPProtoID 21 }.\n   Every FTP command is considered a request in the\
    \ abstract DTP. Every\n   FTP reply is considered a response in the abstract DTP.\
    \ It should be\n   noted that a single FTP command can result in multiple FTP\
    \ replies\n   (e.g. preliminary positive replies). The primary response for a\
    \ FTP\n   request contains a status code of the form 2xy, 3xy, 4xy or 5xy.  See\n\
    \   section 4.2 in [21] for the exact meaning of these status codes.  The\n  \
    \ mappings for WwwRequestType and WwwResponseType are defined as\n   follows:\n\
    \   o    The WwwRequestType corresponds to the FTP command token.\n   o    The\
    \ WwwResponseType corresponds to the three-digit code which\n        starts a\
    \ reply. Multi-line replies with the same three-digit\n        code are counted\
    \ as a single DTP response.\n"
- title: 8.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "8.  Security Considerations\n   There are a number of management objects defined\
    \ in this MIB module\n   that have a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write.  Such objects\
    \ may be\n   considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.\
    \  The\n   support for write operations in a non-secure environment without\n\
    \   proper protection can have a negative effect on network operations.\n   There\
    \ are a number of managed objects in this MIB that may contain\n   sensitive information:\n\
    \   o    The document statistics group contains traffic information\n        including\
    \ the names of documents that were a target of protocol\n        operations. This\
    \ information is sensitive as it allows to obtain\n        access statistics for\
    \ documents.\n   o    The protocol statistics are less sensitive, because they\
    \ do not\n        contain details about the target of individual requests and\n\
    \        responses.  However, traffic statistics and error counters still\n  \
    \      provide usage information about WWW services and about the\n        overall\
    \ quality of WWW services. It is suggested that sites\n        configure MIB views\
    \ so that a user of this MIB can only access\n        the portion of the statistics\
    \ that belong to the WWW services\n        managed by that user.\n   o    The\
    \ service and the summary statistics groups provide\n        information about\
    \ the existence of WWW services and condensed\n        usage statistics.  Some\
    \ sites may want to protect this\n        information as well, especially if they\
    \ offer private WWW\n        services that should not be known by the outside\
    \ world.\n   SNMPv1 by itself is not a secure environment.  Even if the network\n\
    \   itself is secure (for example by using IPSec), there is no control as\n  \
    \ to who on the secure network is allowed to access\n   (read/change/create/delete)\
    \ the objects in this MIB.\n   It is recommended that implementers consider the\
    \ security features as\n   provided by the SNMPv3 framework.  Specifically, the\
    \ use of the\n   User-based Security Model RFC 2574 [12] and the View-based Access\n\
    \   Control Model RFC 2575 [15] is recommended.\n   It is then a customer/user\
    \ responsibility to ensure that the SNMP\n   entity giving access to an instance\
    \ of this MIB is properly\n   configured to give access to the objects only to\
    \ those principals\n   (users) that have legitimate rights to indeed read or write\n\
    \   (change/create/delete) them.\n"
