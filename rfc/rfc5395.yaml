  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   The Domain Name System (DNS) provides replicated distributed\
    \ secure\n   hierarchical databases that store \"resource records\" (RRs) under\n\
    \   domain names.  DNS data is structured into CLASSes and zones that can\n  \
    \ be independently maintained.  See [RFC1034], [RFC1035], [RFC2136],\n   [RFC2181],\
    \ and [RFC4033], familiarity with which is assumed.\n   This document provides,\
    \ either directly or by reference, the general\n   IANA parameter assignment considerations\
    \ that apply across DNS query\n   and response headers and all RRs.  There may\
    \ be additional IANA\n   considerations that apply to only a particular RRTYPE\
    \ or\n   query/response OpCode.  See the specific RFC defining that RRTYPE or\n\
    \   query/response OpCode for such considerations if they have been\n   defined,\
    \ except for AFSDB RR considerations [RFC1183], which are\n   included herein.\
    \  This RFC obsoletes [RFC2929].\n   IANA currently maintains a web page of DNS\
    \ parameters available from\n   http://www.iana.org.\n"

  contents:
  - "2.  DNS Query/Response Headers\n   The header for DNS queries and responses contains\
    \ field/bits in the\n   following diagram taken from [RFC2136] and [RFC2929]:\n\

    \   The ID field identifies the query and is echoed in the response so\n   they\
    \ can be matched.\n   The QR bit indicates whether the header is for a query or\
    \ a response.\n   The AA, TC, RD, RA, AD, and CD bits are each theoretically meaningful\n\
    \   only in queries or only in responses, depending on the bit.  However,\n  \
    \ some DNS implementations copy the query header as the initial value\n   of the\
    \ response header without clearing bits.  Thus, any attempt to\n   use a \"query\"\
    \ bit with a different meaning in a response or to define\n   a query meaning\
    \ for a \"response\" bit is dangerous, given existing\n   implementation.  Such\
    \ meanings may only be assigned by an IETF\n   Standards Action.\n   The unsigned\
    \ integer fields query count (QDCOUNT), answer count\n   (ANCOUNT), authority\
    \ count (NSCOUNT), and additional information\n   count (ARCOUNT) express the\
    \ number of records in each section for all\n   OpCodes except Update [RFC2136].\
    \  These fields have the same\n   structure and data type for Update but are instead\
    \ the counts for the\n   zone (ZOCOUNT), prerequisite (PRCOUNT), update (UPCOUNT),\
    \ and\n   additional information (ARCOUNT) sections.\n"
- title: 2.1.  One Spare Bit?
  contents:
  - "2.1.  One Spare Bit?\n   There have been ancient DNS implementations for which\
    \ the Z bit being\n   on in a query meant that only a response from the primary\
    \ server for\n   a zone is acceptable.  It is believed that current DNS\n   implementations\
    \ ignore this bit.\n   Assigning a meaning to the Z bit requires an IETF Standards\
    \ Action.\n"

  - "2.3.  RCODE Assignment\n   It would appear from the DNS header above that only\
    \ four bits of\n   RCODE, or response/error code, are available.  However, RCODEs\
    \ can\n   appear not only at the top level of a DNS response but also inside\n\
    \   OPT RRs [RFC2671], TSIG RRs [RFC2845], and TKEY RRs [RFC2930].  The\n   OPT\
    \ RR provides an 8-bit extension resulting in a 12-bit RCODE field,\n   and the\

  - "3.1.2.  DNS RRTYPE Expert Guidelines\n   The selected DNS RRTYPE Expert is required\
    \ to monitor discussion of\n   the proposed RRTYPE, which may occur on the namedroppers@ops.ietf.org\n\
    \   mailing list, and may consult with other technical experts as\n   necessary.\
    \  The Expert should normally reject any RRTYPE allocation\n   request that meets\
    \ one or more of the following criterion:\n   1. Was documented in a manner that\
    \ was not sufficiently clear to\n      evaluate or implement.\n   2. The proposed\
    \ RRTYPE or RRTYPEs affect DNS processing and do not\n      meet the criteria\
    \ in point 2 of Section 3.1.1 above.\n   3. The documentation of the proposed\
    \ RRTYPE or RRTYPEs is incomplete.\n      (Additional documentation can be provided\
    \ during the public\n      comment period or by the Expert.)\n   4. Application\
    \ use as documented makes incorrect assumptions about\n      DNS protocol behavior,\
    \ such as wild cards, CNAME, DNAME, etc.\n   5. An excessive number of RRTYPE\
    \ values is being requested when the\n      purpose could be met with a smaller\
    \ number or with Private Use\n      values.\n"

  - "3.1.3.  Special Note on the OPT RR\n   The OPT (OPTion) RR (RRTYPE 41) and its\
    \ IANA Considerations are\n   specified in [RFC2671].  Its primary purpose is\
    \ to extend the\n   effective field size of various DNS fields including RCODE,\
    \ label\n   type, OpCode, flag bits, and RDATA size.  In particular, for\n   resolvers\

  contents:
  - "3.2.  RR CLASS IANA Considerations\n   There are currently two subcategories\
    \ of DNS CLASSes: normal,\n   data-containing classes and QCLASSes that are only\
    \ meaningful in\n   queries or updates.\n   DNS CLASSes have been little used\
    \ but constitute another dimension of\n   the DNS distributed database.  In particular,\
    \ there is no necessary\n   relationship between the name space or root servers\
    \ for one data\n   CLASS and those for another data CLASS.  The same DNS NAME\
    \ can have\n   completely different meanings in different CLASSes.  The label\
    \ types\n   are the same, and the null label is usable only as root in every\n\
    \   CLASS.  As global networking and DNS have evolved, the IN, or\n   Internet,\
    \ CLASS has dominated DNS use.\n   As yet there has not be a requirement for \"\
    meta-CLASSes\".  That would\n   be a CLASS to designate transient data associated\
    \ with a particular\n   DNS message, which might be usable in queries.  However,\
    \ it is\n   possible that there might be a future requirement for one or more\n\
    \   \"meta-CLASSes\".\n   CLASSes have mnemonics that must be completely disjoint\

- title: 3.3.1.  Label Types
  contents:
  - "3.3.1.  Label Types\n   At the present time, there are two categories of label\
    \ types: data\n   labels and compression labels.  Compression labels are pointers\
    \ to\n   data labels elsewhere within an RR or DNS message and are intended to\n\
    \   shorten the wire encoding of NAMEs.\n   The two existing data label types\
    \ are sometimes referred to as Text\n   and Binary.  Text labels can, in fact,\
    \ include any octet value\n   including zero-value octets, but many current uses\
    \ involve only\n   [US-ASCII].  For retrieval, Text labels are defined to treat\
    \ ASCII\n   upper and lower case letter codes as matching [RFC4343].  Binary\n\
    \   labels are bit sequences [RFC2673].  The Binary label type is\n   Experimental\

    \ be used for any\n   other NAME purpose.\n   NAMEs are local to a CLASS.  The\
    \ Hesiod [Dyer1987] and Chaos\n   [Moon1981] CLASSes are for essentially local\
    \ use.  The IN, or\n   Internet, CLASS is thus the only DNS CLASS in global use\
    \ on the\n   Internet at this time.\n   A somewhat out-of-date description of\
    \ name allocation in the IN Class\n   is given in [RFC1591].  Some information\
