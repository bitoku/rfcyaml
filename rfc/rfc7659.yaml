  - "Abstract\n   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)\n\
    \   for devices implementing the Network Address Translator (NAT)\n   function.\
    \  The new MIB module defined in this document, NATV2-MIB, is\n   intended to\
    \ replace module NAT-MIB (RFC 4008).  NATV2-MIB is not\n   backwards compatible\
    \ with NAT-MIB, for reasons given in the text of\n   this document.  A companion\
    \ document deprecates all objects in NAT-\n   MIB.  NATV2-MIB can be used for\
    \ the monitoring of NAT instances on a\n   device capable of NAT function.  Compliance\
    \ levels are defined for\n   three application scenarios: basic NAT, pooled NAT,\
    \ and\n   carrier-grade NAT (CGN).\n"

- title: 2.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "2.  Introduction\n   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information\
    \ Base (MIB)\n   for devices implementing NAT functions.  This MIB module, NATV2-MIB,\n\
    \   may be used for the monitoring of such devices.  NATV2-MIB supersedes\n  \
    \ NAT-MIB [RFC4008], which did not fit well with existing NAT\n   implementations,\
    \ and hence was not itself much implemented.\n   [RFC7658] provides a detailed\
    \ analysis of the deficiencies of\n   NAT-MIB.\n   Relative to [RFC4008] and based\
    \ on the analysis just mentioned, the\n   present document introduces the following\
    \ changes:\n   o  removed all writable configuration except that related to control\n\
    \      of the generation of notifications and the setting of quotas on\n     \
    \ the use of NAT resources;\n   o  minimized the read-only exposure of configuration\
    \ to what is\n      needed to provide context for the state and statistical\n\
    \      information presented by the MIB module;\n   o  removed the association\
    \ between mapping and interfaces, retaining\n      only the mapping aspect;\n\
    \   o  replaced references to NAT types with references to NAT behaviors\n   \
    \   as specified in [RFC4787];\n   o  replaced a module-specific enumeration of\
    \ protocols with the\n      standard protocol numbers provided by the IANA Protocol\
    \ Numbers\n      registry.\n   This MIB module adds the following features not\
    \ present in [RFC4008]:\n   o  additional writable protective limits on NAT state\
    \ data;\n   o  additional objects to report state, statistics, and notifications;\n\
    \   o  support for the carrier-grade NAT (CGN) application, including\n      subscriber-awareness,\
    \ support for an arbitrary number of address\n      realms, and support for multiple\
    \ NAT instances running on a single\n      device;\n   o  expanded support for\
    \ address pools;\n   o  revised indexing of port map entries to simplify traceback\
    \ from\n      externally observable packet parameters to the corresponding\n \
    \     internal endpoint.\n   These features are described in more detail below.\n\
    \   The remainder of this document is organized as follows:\n   o  Section 3 provides\
    \ a verbal description of the content and\n      organization of the MIB module.\n\
    \   o  Section 4 provides the MIB module definition.\n   o  Section 5 discusses\
    \ operational and management issues relating to\n      the deployment of NATV2-MIB.\
    \  One of these issues is NAT\n      management when both NAT-MIB [RFC4008] and\
    \ NATV2-MIB are deployed.\n   o  Sections 6 and 7 provide a security discussion\
    \ and a request to\n      IANA for allocation of an object identifier for the\
    \ module in the\n      mib-2 tree, respectively.\n   The key words \"MUST\", \"\
    MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\"\
    , \"RECOMMENDED\", \"NOT RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and\n   \"OPTIONAL\" in this\
    \ document are to be interpreted as described in\n   [RFC2119].\n   This document\
    \ uses the following terminology:\n   Upper-layer protocol:  The protocol following\
    \ the outer IP header of\n      a packet.  This follows the terminology of [RFC2460],\
    \ but as that\n      document points out, \"upper\" is not necessarily a correct\n\
    \      description of the protocol relationships (e.g., where IP is\n      encapsulated\
    \ in IP).  The abbreviated term \"protocol\" will often\n      be used where it\
    \ is unambiguous.\n   Trigger:  With respect to notifications, the logical recognition\
    \ of\n      the event that the notification is intended to report.\n   Report:\
    \  The actual production of a notification message.  Reporting\n      can happen\
    \ later than triggering, or may never happen for a given\n      notification instance,\
    \ because of the operation of notification\n      rate controls.\n   Address realm:\
    \  A network domain in which the network addresses are\n      uniquely assigned\
    \ to entities such that datagrams can be routed to\n      them.  (Definition taken\
    \ from [RFC2663], Section 2.1.)  The\n      abbreviated term \"realm\" will often\
    \ be used.\n"

    \   organization of the NATV2-MIB module.\n"
- title: 3.1.  Content Provided by the NATV2-MIB Module
  contents:
  - "3.1.  Content Provided by the NATV2-MIB Module\n   The content provided by the\
    \ NATV2-MIB module can be classed under\n   four headings: configuration data,\
    \ notifications, state information,\n   and statistics.\n"
- title: 3.1.1.  Configuration Data
  contents:
  - "3.1.1.  Configuration Data\n   As mentioned above, the intent in designing the\
    \ NATV2-MIB module was\n   to minimize the amount of configuration data presented\
    \ to that needed\n   to give a context for interpreting the other types of information\n\
    \   provided.  Detailed descriptions of the configuration data are\n   included\
    \ with the descriptions of the individual tables.  In general,\n   that data is\
    \ limited to what is needed for indexing and cross-\n   referencing between tables.\
    \  The two exceptions are the objects\n   describing NAT instance behavior in\
    \ the NAT instance table and the\n   detailed enumeration of resources allocated\
    \ to each address pool in\n   the pool table and its extension.\n   The NATV2-MIB\
    \ module provides three sets of read-write objects,\n   specifically related to\
    \ other aspects of the module content.  The\n   first set controls the rate at\
    \ which specific notifications are\n   generated.  The second set provides thresholds\
    \ used to trigger the\n   notifications.  These objects are listed in Section\
    \ 3.1.2.\n   A third set of read-write objects sets limits on resource consumption\n\
    \   per NAT instance and per subscriber.  When these limits are reached,\n   packets\
    \ requiring further consumption of the given resource are\n   dropped rather than\
    \ translated.  Statistics described in\n   Section 3.1.4 record the numbers of\
    \ packets dropped.  Limits are\n   provided for:\n   o  total number of address\
    \ map entries over the NAT instance.  Limit\n      is set by object natv2InstanceLimitAddressMapEntries\
    \ in table\n      natv2InstanceTable.  Dropped packets are counted in\n      natv2InstanceAddressMapEntryLimitDrops\
    \ in that table.\n   o  total number of port map entries over the NAT instance.\
    \  Limit is\n      set by object natv2InstanceLimitPortMapEntries in table\n \
    \     natv2InstanceTable.  Dropped packets are counted in\n      natv2InstancePortMapEntryLimitDrops\
    \ in that table.\n   o  total number of held fragments (applicable only when the\
    \ NAT\n      instance can receive fragments out of order; see [RFC4787],\n   \
    \   Section 11).  Limit is set by object\n      natv2InstanceLimitPendingFragments\
    \ in table natv2InstanceTable.\n      Dropped packets are counted by natv2InstanceFragmentDrops\
    \ in the\n      same table.\n   o  total number of active subscribers (i.e., subscribers\
    \ having at\n      least one mapping table entry) over the NAT instance.  Limit\
    \ is\n      set by object natv2InstanceLimitSubscriberActives in table\n     \
    \ natv2InstanceTable.  Dropped packets are counted by\n      natv2InstanceSubscriberActiveLimitDrops\
    \ in the same table.\n   o  number of port map entries for an individual subscriber.\
    \  Limit is\n      set by object natv2SubscriberLimitPortMapEntries in table\n\
    \      natv2SubscriberTable.  Dropped packets are counted by\n      natv2SubscriberPortMapFailureDrops\
    \ in the same table.  Note that,\n      unlike in the instance table, the per-subscriber\
    \ count is lumped\n      in with the count of packets dropped because of failures\
    \ to\n      allocate a port map entry for other reasons to save on storage.\n"
- title: 3.1.2.  Notifications
  contents:
  - "3.1.2.  Notifications\n   NATV2-MIB provides five notifications, intended to\
    \ provide warning of\n   the need to provision or reallocate NAT resources.  As\
    \ indicated in\n   the previous section, each notification is associated with\
    \ two read-\n   write objects: a control on the rate at which that notification\
    \ is\n   generated and a threshold value used to trigger the notification in\n\
    \   the first place.  The default setting within the MIB module\n   specification\
    \ is that all notifications are disabled.  The setting of\n   threshold values\
    \ is discussed in Section 5.\n   The five notifications are as follows:\n   o\
    \  Two notifications relate to the management of address pools.  One\n      indicates\
    \ that usage equals or exceeds an upper threshold and is\n      therefore a warning\
    \ that the pool may be over-utilized unless more\n      addresses are assigned\
    \ to it.  The other notification indicates\n      that usage equals or has fallen\
    \ below a lower threshold,\n      suggesting that some addresses allocated to\
    \ that pool could be\n      reallocated to other pools.  Address pool usage is\
    \ calculated as\n      the percentage of the total number of ports allocated to\
    \ the\n      address pool that are already in use, for the most-mapped protocol\n\
    \      at the time the notification is generated.  The notifications\n      identify\
    \ that protocol and report the number of port map entries\n      for that protocol\
    \ in the given address pool at the moment the\n      notification was triggered.\n\
    \   o  Two notifications relate to the number of address and port map\n      entries,\
    \ respectively, in total over the whole NAT instance.  In\n      both cases, the\
    \ threshold that triggers the notification is an\n      upper threshold.  The\
    \ notifications return the number of mapping\n      entries of the given type,\
    \ plus a cumulative counter of the number\n      of entries created in that mapping\
    \ table at the moment the\n      notification was triggered.  The intent is that\
    \ the notifications\n      provide a warning that the total number of address\
    \ or port map\n      entries is approaching the configured limit.\n   o  The final\
    \ notification is generated on a per-subscriber basis when\n      the number of\
    \ port map entries for that subscriber crosses the\n      associated threshold.\
    \  The objects returned by this notification\n      are similar to those returned\
    \ for the instance-level mapping\n      notifications.  This notification is a\
    \ warning that the number of\n      port map entries for the subscriber is approaching\
    \ the configured\n      limit for that subscriber.\n   Here is a detailed specification\
    \ of the notifications.  A given\n   notification can be disabled by setting the\
    \ threshold to -1\n   (default).\n   Notification: natv2NotificationPoolUsageLow.\
    \  Indicates that address\n   pool usage for the most-mapped protocol equals or\
    \ is less than the\n   threshold value.\n   Compared value:  natv2PoolNotifiedPortMapEntries\
    \ as a percentage of\n      total available ports in the pool.\n   Threshold:\

- title: 3.1.3.  State Information
  contents:
  - "3.1.3.  State Information\n   State information provides a snapshot of the content\
    \ and extent of\n   the NAT mapping tables at a given moment of time.  The address\
    \ and\n   port mapping tables are described in detail below.  In addition to\n\
    \   these tables, two state variables are provided: current number of\n   entries\
    \ in the address mapping table, and current number of entries\n   in the port\
    \ mapping table.  With one exception, these are provided at\n   four levels of\
    \ granularity: per NAT instance, per protocol, per\n   address pool, and per subscriber.\
    \  Address map entries are not\n   tracked per protocol, since address mapping\
    \ is protocol independent.\n"
- title: 3.1.4.  Statistics
  contents:
  - "3.1.4.  Statistics\n   NATV2-MIB provides a number of counters, intended to help\
    \ with both\n   the provisioning of the NAT and the debugging of problems.  As\
    \ with\n   the state data, these counters are provided at the four levels of NAT\n\
    \   instance, protocol, address pool, and subscriber when they make\n   sense.\
    \  Each counter is cumulative, beginning from a \"last\n   discontinuity time\"\
    \ recorded by an object that is usually in the\n   table containing the counter.\n\
    \   The basic set of counters, as reflected in the NAT instance table, is\n  \
    \ as follows:\n   Translations:  number of packets processed and translated (in\
    \ this\n      case, in total for the NAT instance).\n   Address map entry creations:\
    \  cumulative number of address map\n      entries created, including static mappings.\n\
    \   Port map entry creations:  cumulative number of port map entries\n      created,\
    \ including static mappings.\n   Address map limit drops:  cumulative number of\
    \ packets dropped rather\n      than translated because the packet would have\
    \ triggered the\n      creation of a new address mapping, but the configured limit\
    \ on\n      number of address map entries has already been reached.\n   Port map\
    \ limit drops:  cumulative number of packets dropped rather\n      than translated\
    \ because the packet would have triggered the\n      creation of a new port mapping,\
    \ but the configured limit on number\n      of port map entries has already been\
    \ reached.\n   Active subscriber limit drops:  cumulative number of packets dropped\n\
    \      rather than translated because the packet would have triggered the\n  \
    \    creation of a new address and/or port mapping for a subscriber\n      with\
    \ no existing entries in either table, but the configured limit\n      on number\
    \ of active subscribers has already been reached.\n   Address mapping failure\
    \ drops:  cumulative number of packets dropped\n      because the packet would\
    \ have triggered the creation of a new\n      address mapping, but no address\
    \ could be allocated in the external\n      realm concerned because all addresses\
    \ from the selected address\n      pool (or the whole realm, if no address pool\
    \ has been configured\n      for that realm) have already been fully allocated.\n\
    \   Port mapping failure drops:  cumulative number of packets dropped\n      because\
    \ the packet would have triggered the creation of a new port\n      mapping, but\
    \ no port could be allocated for the protocol\n      concerned.  The precise conditions\
    \ under which these packet drops\n      occur depend on the pooling behavior [RFC4787]\

    \ mapping failure.\n   Fragment drops:  cumulative number of packets dropped because\
    \ the\n      packet contains a fragment, and the fragment behavior [RFC4787]\n\
    \      configured or implemented in the NAT instance indicates that the\n    \
    \  packet should be dropped.  The main case is a NAT instance that\n      meets\
    \ REQ-14 of [RFC4787], hence it can receive and process out-\n      of-order fragments.\
    \  In that case, dropping occurs only when the\n      configured limit on pending\
    \ fragments provided by NATV2-MIB has\n      already been reached.  The other\
    \ cases are detailed in the\n      DESCRIPTION clause of the natv2InstanceFragmentBehavior\
    \ object.\n   Other resource drops:  cumulative number of packets dropped because\n\
    \      of unavailability of some other resource.  The most likely case\n     \
    \ would be packets where the upper-layer protocol is not one\n      supported\
    \ by the NAT instance.\n   Table 1 indicates the granularities at which these\

    \   ProtocolNumber is based on the IANA registry of protocol numbers and\n   hence\
    \ is potentially reusable by other MIB modules.\n   Objects of type Natv2SubscriberIndex\
    \ identify individual subscribers\n   served by the NAT device.  The values of\
    \ these identifiers are\n   administered and, in intent, are permanently associated\
    \ with their\n   respective subscribers.  Reuse of a value after a subscriber\
    \ has been\n   deleted is discouraged.  The scope of the subscriber index was\n\
    \   defined to be at the device rather than the NAT instance level to\n   make\
    \ it easier to shift subscribers between instances (e.g., for load\n   balancing).\n\
    \   Objects of type Natv2InstanceIndex identify specific NAT instances on\n  \
    \ the device.  Again, these are administered values intended to be\n   permanently\
    \ associated with the NAT instances to which they have been\n   assigned.\n  \
    \ Objects of type Natv2PoolIndex identify individual address pools in a\n   given\
    \ NAT instance.  As with the subscriber and instance index\n   objects, the pool\
    \ identifiers are administered and intended to be\n   permanently associated with\

    \ is unique, so no conceptual row index is needed.  The indexing\n   is designed\
    \ to make it easy to trace individual sessions back to the\n   host, based on\
    \ the contents of packets observed in the external\n   realm.\n   Beyond the indexing,\
    \ the information provided by the port map table\n   consists of the internal\
    \ realm, address type, address, and port\n   number, and, depending on implementation\
    \ support, the index of the\n   subscriber to which the map entry belongs.\n \
    \  As with the address map table, special provision is made for the case\n   of\
    \ DS-Lite [RFC6333].  The realm and outgoing source address are\n   those for\
    \ the outer header, and the address type is IPv6.  Additional\n   objects natv2PortMapInternalMappedAddressType\
    \ and\n   natv2PortMapInternalMappedAddress capture the outgoing source address\n\
    \   in the inner header, which will be in the well-known 192.0.0.0/29\n   range.\n"

  - "3.4.  Conformance: Three Application Scenarios\n   The conformance statements\
    \ in NATV2-MIB provide for three application\n   scenarios: basic NAT, NAT supporting\
    \ address pools, and CGN.\n   A basic NAT MAY limit the number of NAT instances\
    \ it supports to one,\n   but it MUST support indexing by NAT instance.  Similarly,\
    \ a basic NAT\n   MAY limit the number of realms it supports to two.  By definition,\
    \ a\n   basic NAT is not required to support the subscriber table, the\n   address\
    \ pool table, or the address pool address range table.  Some\n   individual objects\
    \ in other tables are also not relevant to basic\n   NAT.\n   A NAT supporting\
    \ address pools adds the address pool table and the\n   address pool address range\
    \ table to what it implements.  Some\n   individual objects in other tables also\
    \ need to be implemented.  A\n   NAT supporting address pools MUST support more\
    \ than two realms.\n   Finally, a CGN MUST support the full contents of the MIB\
    \ module.\n   That includes the subscriber table, but it also includes the special\n\
    \   provision for DS-Lite access in the address and port map tables.\n"

  - "5.  Operational and Management Considerations\n   This section covers two particular\
    \ areas of operations and\n   management: configuration requirements and transition\
    \ from or\n   coexistence with the MIB module in [RFC4008].\n"
- title: 5.1.  Configuration Requirements
  contents:
  - "5.1.  Configuration Requirements\n   This MIB module assumes that the following\
    \ information is configured\n   on the NAT device by means outside the scope of\
    \ the present document\n   or is imposed by the implementation:\n   o  the set\
    \ of address realms to which the device connects;\n   o  for the CGN application,\
    \ per-subscriber information including\n      subscriber index, address realm,\
    \ assigned prefix or address, and\n      (possibly) policies regarding address\
    \ pool selection in the\n      various possible address realms to which the subscriber\
    \ may\n      connect.  In the particular case of DS-Lite [RFC6333] access, as\n\
    \      well as the assigned outer-layer (IPv6) prefix or address, the\n      subscriber\
    \ information will include an inner (IPv4) source\n      address, usually 192.0.0.2;\n\
    \   o  the set of NAT instances running on the device, identified by NAT\n   \
    \   instance index and name;\n   o  the port mapping, filtering, pooling, and\
    \ fragment behavior for\n      each NAT instance;\n   o  the set of protocols\
    \ supported by each NAT instance;\n   o  for the pooled NAT and CGN applications,\
    \ address pool information\n      for each NAT instance, including for each pool\
    \ the pool index,\n      address realm, address type, minimum and maximum port\
    \ number, the\n      address ranges assigned to that pool, and policies for access\
    \ to\n      that pool's resources;\n   o  static address and port map entries.\n\
    \   As described in previous sections, this MIB module does provide read-\n  \
    \ write objects for control of notifications (see especially\n   Section 3.1.2)\
    \ and limiting of resource consumption (Section 3.1.1).\n   This document is written\
    \ in advance of any practical experience with\n   the setting of these values\
    \ and can thus provide only general\n   principles for how to set them.\n   By\
    \ default, the MIB module definition disables notifications until\n   they are\
    \ explicitly enabled by the operator, using the associated\n   threshold value\
    \ to do so.  To make use of the notifications, the\n   operator may wish to take\
    \ the following considerations into account.\n   Except for the low address pool\
    \ utilization notification, the\n   notifications imply that some sort of administrative\
    \ action is\n   required to mitigate an impending shortage of a particular resource.\n\
    \   The choice of value for the triggering threshold needs to take two\n   factors\
    \ into account: the volatility of usage of the given resource,\n   and the amount\
    \ of time the operator needs to mitigate the potential\n   overload situation.\
    \  That time could vary from almost immediate to\n   several weeks required to\
    \ order and install new hardware or software.\n   To give a numeric example, if\
    \ average utilization is going up 1% per\n   week but can vary 10% around that\
    \ average in any given hour, and it\n   takes two weeks to carry through mitigating\
    \ measures, the threshold\n   should be set to 88% of the corresponding limit\
    \ (two weeks' growth\n   plus 10% volatility margin).  If mitigating measures\
    \ can be carried\n   out immediately, this can rise to 90%.  For this particular\
    \ example,\n   that change is insignificant, but in other cases the difference\
    \ may\n   be large enough to matter in terms of reduced load on the management\n\
    \   plane.\n   The notification rate-limit settings really depend on the operator's\n\
    \   processes but are a tradeoff between reliably reporting the notified\n   condition\
    \ and not having it overload the management plane.\n   Reliability rises in importance\
    \ with the importance of the resource\n   involved.  Thus, the default notification\
    \ intervals defined in this\n   MIB module range from 10 seconds (high reliability)\
    \ for the address\n   and port map entry thresholds up to 60 seconds (lower reliability)\n\
    \   for the per-subscriber port entry thresholds.  Experience may suggest\n  \
    \ better values.\n   The limits on number of instance-level address map and port\
    \ map\n   entries and held fragments relate directly to memory allocations for\n\
    \   these tables.  The relationship between number of map entries or\n   number\
    \ of held fragments and memory required will be implementation-\n   specific.\
    \  Hence it is up to the implementor to provide specific\n   advice on the setting\
    \ of these limits.\n   The limit on simultaneous number of active subscribers\
    \ is indirectly\n   related to memory consumption for map entries, but also to\
    \ processor\n   usage by the NAT instance.  The best strategy for setting this\
    \ limit\n   would seem to be to leave it disabled during an initial period while\n\
    \   observing device processor utilization, then to implement a trial\n   setting\
    \ while observing the number of blocked packets affected by the\n   new limit.\
    \  The setting may vary by NAT instance if a suitable\n   estimator of likely\
    \ load (e.g., total number of hosts served by that\n   instance) is available.\n"

  - "5.2.  Transition from and Coexistence with NAT-MIB (RFC 4008)\n   A manager may\
    \ have to deal with a mixture of devices supporting the\n   NAT-MIB module [RFC4008]\
    \ and the NATV2-MIB module defined in the\n   present document.  It is even possible\
    \ that both modules are\n   supported on the same device.  The following discussion\
    \ brings out\n   the limits of comparability between the two MIB modules.  A first\n\
    \   point to note is that NAT-MIB is primarily focused on configuration,\n   while\
    \ NATV2-MIB is primarily focused on measurements.\n   To summarize the model used\
    \ by [RFC4008]:\n   o  The basic unit of NAT configuration is the interface.\n\
    \   o  An interface connects to a single realm, either \"private\" or\n      \"\
    public\".  In principle that means there could be multiple\n      instances of\
    \ one type of realm or the other, but the number is\n      physically limited\
    \ by the number of interfaces on the NAT device.\n   o  Before the NAT can operate\
    \ on a given interface, an \"address map\"\n      has to be configured on it.\
    \  The address map in [RFC4008] is\n      equivalent to the pool tables in the\
    \ present document.  Since just\n      one \"address map\" is configured per interface,\
    \ this is the\n      equivalent of a single address pool per interface.\n   o\
    \  The address binding and port binding tables are roughly equivalent\n      to\
    \ the address map and port map tables in the present document in\n      their\
    \ content, but they can be either unidirectional or\n      bidirectional.  The\
    \ model in [RFC4008] shows the address binding\n      and port binding as alternative\
    \ precursors to session\n      establishment, depending on whether the device\
    \ does address\n      translation only or address and port translation.  In contrast,\n\
    \      NATV2-MIB assumes a model where bidirectional port mappings are\n     \
    \ based on bidirectional address mappings that have conceptually\n      been established\
    \ beforehand.\n   o  The equivalent to an [RFC4008] session in NATV2-MIB would\
    \ be a\n      pair of port map entries.  The added complexity in [RFC4008] is\n\
    \      due to the modeling of NAT service types as defined in [RFC3489]\n    \
    \  (the symmetric NAT in particular) instead of the more granular set\n      of\
    \ behaviors described in [RFC4787].  (Note: [RFC3489] has been\n      obsoleted\
    \ by [RFC5389].)\n   With regard to that last point, the mapping between [RFC3489]\
    \ service\n   types and [RFC4787] NAT behaviors is as follows:\n   o  A full cone\
    \ NAT exhibits endpoint-independent port mapping\n      behavior and endpoint-independent\
    \ filtering behavior.\n   o  A restricted cone NAT exhibits endpoint-independent\
    \ port mapping\n      behavior, but address-dependent filtering behavior.\n  \
    \ o  A port restricted cone NAT exhibits endpoint-independent port\n      mapping\
    \ behavior, but address-and-port-dependent filtering\n      behavior.\n   o  A\
    \ symmetric NAT exhibits address-and-port-dependent port mapping\n      and filtering\
    \ behaviors.\n   Note that these NAT types are a subset of the types that could\
    \ be\n   configured according to the [RFC4787] behavioral classification used\n\
    \   in NATV2-MIB, but they include the two possibilities (full and\n   restricted\
    \ cone NAT) that satisfy requirements REQ-1 and REQ-8 of\n   [RFC4787].  Note\
    \ further that other behaviors defined in [RFC4787]\n   are not considered in\
    \ [RFC4008].\n   Having established a context for discussion, we are now in a\
    \ position\n   to compare the outputs provided to management from the [RFC4008]\
    \ and\n   NATV2-MIB modules.  This comparison relates to the ability to compare\n\
    \   results if testing with both MIBs implemented on the same device\n   during\
    \ a transition period.\n   [RFC4008] provides three counters: incoming translations,\
    \ outgoing\n   translations, and discarded packets, at the granularities of\n\
    \   interface, address map, and protocol, and incoming and outgoing\n   translations\
    \ at the levels of individual address bind, address port\n   bind, and session\
    \ entries.  Implementation at the protocol and\n   address map levels is optional.\
    \  NATV2-MIB provides a single total\n   (both directions) translations counter\
    \ at the instance, protocol\n   within instance, and subscriber levels.  Given\
    \ the differences in\n   granularity, it appears that the only comparable measurement\
    \ of\n   translations between the two MIB modules would be through aggregation\n\
    \   of the [RFC4008] interface counters to give a total number of\n   translations\
    \ for the NAT instance.\n   NATV2-MIB has broken out the single discard counter\
    \ into a number of\n   different counters reflecting the cause of the discard\
    \ in more\n   detail, to help in troubleshooting.  Again, with the differing levels\n\
    \   of granularity, the only comparable statistic would be through\n   aggregation\
    \ to a single value of total discards per NAT instance.\n   Moving on to state\
    \ variables, [RFC4008] offers counts of number of\n   \"address map\" (i.e., address\
    \ pool) entries used (excluding static\n   entries) at the address map level and\
    \ number of entries in the\n   address bind and address and port bind tables,\
    \ respectively.\n   Finally, [RFC4008] provides a count of the number of sessions\n\
    \   currently using each entry in the address and port bind table.  None\n   of\
    \ these counts are directly comparable with the state values offered\n   by NATV2-MIB,\
    \ because of the exclusion of static entries at the\n   address map level, and\
    \ because of the differing models of the\n   translation tables between [RFC4008]\
    \ and the NATV2-MIB.\n"

  - "6.  Security Considerations\n   There are a number of management objects defined\
    \ in this MIB module\n   with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write.  Such objects\
    \ may be\n   considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.\
    \  The\n   support for SET operations in a non-secure environment without proper\n\
    \   protection opens devices to attack.  These are the tables and objects\n  \
    \ and their sensitivity/vulnerability:\n   Limits:  An attacker setting a very\
    \ low or very high limit can easily\n      cause a denial-of-service situation.\n\

    \      *  natv2InstanceLimitPendingFragments;\n      *  natv2InstanceLimitSubscriberActives;\n\
    \      *  natv2SubscriberLimitPortMapEntries.\n   Notification thresholds:  An\
    \ attacker setting an arbitrarily low\n      threshold can cause many useless\
    \ notifications to be generated\n      (subject to the notification interval).\
    \  Setting an arbitrarily\n      high threshold can effectively disable notifications,\
    \ which could\n      be used to hide another attack.\n      *  natv2InstanceThresholdAddressMapEntriesHigh;\n\
    \      *  natv2InstanceThresholdPortMapEntriesHigh;\n      *  natv2PoolThresholdUsageLow;\n\
    \      *  natv2PoolThresholdUsageHigh;\n      *  natv2SubscriberThresholdPortMapEntriesHigh.\n\
    \   Notification intervals:  An attacker setting a low notification\n      interval\
    \ in combination with a low threshold value can cause many\n      useless notifications\
    \ to be generated.\n      *  natv2InstanceNotificationInterval;\n      *  natv2PoolNotificationInterval;\n\
    \      *  natv2SubscriberNotificationInterval.\n   Some of the readable objects\
    \ in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a\n   MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible)\
    \ may be considered sensitive or\n   vulnerable in some network environments.\
    \  It is thus important to\n   control even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these\
    \ objects and possibly\n   to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending\
    \ them over\n   the network via SNMP.  These are the tables and objects and their\n\
    \   sensitivity/vulnerability:\n   Objects that reveal host identities:  Various\
    \ objects can reveal the\n      identity of private hosts that are engaged in\
    \ a session with\n      external end nodes.  A curious outsider could monitor\
    \ these to\n      assess the number of private hosts being supported by the NAT\n\
    \      device.  Further, a disgruntled former employee of an enterprise\n    \
    \  could use the information to break into specific private hosts by\n      intercepting\
    \ the existing sessions or originating new sessions\n      into the host.  If\
    \ nothing else, unauthorized monitoring of these\n      objects will violate individual\
    \ subscribers' privacy.\n      *  entries in the natv2SubscriberTable;\n     \
    \ *  entries in the natv2AddressMapTable;\n      *  entries in the natv2PortMapTable.\n\
    \   Other objects that reveal NAT state:  Other managed objects in this\n    \
    \  MIB may contain information that may be sensitive from a business\n      perspective,\
    \ in that they may represent NAT capabilities, business\n      policies, and state\
    \ information.\n      *  natv2SubscriberLimitPortMapEntries;\n      *  natv2InstancePortMappingBehavior;\n\
    \      *  natv2InstanceFilteringBehavior;\n      *  natv2InstancePoolingBehavior;\n\
    \      *  natv2InstanceFragmentBehavior;\n      *  natv2InstanceAddressMapEntries;\n\
    \      *  natv2InstancePortMapEntries.\n   There are no objects that are sensitive\
    \ in their own right, such as\n   passwords or monetary amounts.\n   SNMP versions\
    \ prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.\n   Even if the network itself\
    \ is secure (for example by using IPsec),\n   there is no control as to who on\
    \ the secure network is allowed to\n   access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete)\
    \ the objects in this\n   MIB module.\n   Implementations SHOULD provide the security\
    \ features described by the\n   SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410]), and implementations\
    \ claiming\n   compliance to the SNMPv3 standard MUST include full support for\n\
    \   authentication and privacy via the User-based Security Model (USM)\n   [RFC3414]\
    \ with the AES cipher algorithm [RFC3826].  Implementations\n   MAY also provide\
    \ support for the Transport Security Model (TSM)\n   [RFC5591] in combination\
    \ with a secure transport such as SSH\n   [RFC5592] or TLS/DTLS [RFC6353].\n \
    \  Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT\n   RECOMMENDED.\
    \  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to\n   enable cryptographic\
    \ security.  It is then a customer/operator\n   responsibility to ensure that\
    \ the SNMP entity giving access to an\n   instance of this MIB module is properly\
    \ configured to give access to\n   the objects only to those principals (users)\
    \ that have legitimate\n   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete)\
    \ them.\n"
