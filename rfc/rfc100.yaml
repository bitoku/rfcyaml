  - "                  Categorization and Guide to NWG/RFCs\n   The NWG/RFC Guide\
    \ is an attempt to introduce some order into the\n   NWG/RFC series, which now\
    \ numbers 102.  The Guide categorizes the\n   NWG/RFC notes, identifies topics\
    \ under discussion and the relevant\n   NWG/RFCs, and indicates whether the notes\
    \ are current, obsolete, or\n   superseded.\n   A minimum subset of NWG/RFCs is\
    \ identified.  This subset consists of\n   the NWG/RFCs that one should read to\
    \ quickly become familiar with the\n   current status of topics.\n   For historical\
    \ reasons and for readers interested in tracing through\n   the stages of development\
    \ of a topic, a brief summary is given for\n   each NWG/RFC relevant to a particular\
    \ category.\n   This initial Guide is being issued as a NWG/RFC since it establishes\n\
    \   the basis for future releases.  So, please comment! Suggestions,\n   criticism,\
    \ corrections, etc., will be accepted for a period of\n   approximately two weeks.\
    \  Be critical as I have not had to implement\n   an NCP and probably have some\
    \ misconceptions regarding various\n   technical points.  An official version\
    \ will be released on March 26.\n   The Guide will then be a unique series of\
    \ documents, separate from\n   NWG/RFCs (as is the Document No. 1, No. 2 series).\n\
    \   With regard to renumbering NWG/RFCs, I am inclined to keep she\n   sequential\
    \ numbering scheme presently employed.  The main reason for\n   this position\
    \ is that the current numbers have both historical and\n   semantic significance.\
    \  For example, reference to \"#33, #66, #83,\n   etc.\" is a convenient shorthand\
    \ (reminiscent of the old corny joke\n   about joke #s) used extensively during\
    \ meetings.  The list of\n   \"current status\" NWG/RFC numbers should dispel\
    \ any fear of\n   maintaining stacks of NWG/RFCs for quick reference.  The subject\
    \ is\n   not closed, however, and I will entertain any objections,\n   suggestions,\
    \ etc.\n"

    \ documents to be published\n   are identified.\n   For each subcategory, relevant\
    \ NWG/RFCs are listed and a brief\n   description of the topics addressed in each\
    \ note is given.\n   The categories are again listed and the current NWG/RFCs\

    \   In particular:\n   17 raised several questions regarding HOST/IMP protocol.\
    \  In 17a,BBN\n   responds to the questions.\n   19 proposes that the hosts control\
    \ the ordering of IMP/Host traffic\n   rather than getting messages delivered\
    \ in the order received by the\n   IMP.  This proposal is counter to BBN's position,\
    \ specifically\n   expressed in 47; that is, buffering is a Host rather than an\
    \ IMP\n   function.  The purpose of buffering in the IMP is to handle surges of\n\
    \   traffic, thus IMP buffers should be empty.  NWG/RFC 19 is obsolete.\n   21\

    \   In particular:\n   102 presents the decision of the Host/Host protocol committee\
    \ to\n   abandon the marking convention and to ignore padding.  The issue of\n\
    \   whether to have the first data byte begin after 72 bits of header or\n   to\
    \ use double physical transmission (NWG/RFC #s 65, 67) is discussed.\n   The former\
    \ official position is expressed in 54: \"All regular\n   messages consist of\
    \ a 32 bit leader, marking, text, and padding.\n   Marking is a (possibly null)\
    \ sequence of zeros followed by a 1;\n   padding is a 1 followed by a (possibly\
    \ null) sequence of zeros.\"\n   Several proposals to eliminate marking have been\
    \ made. 64 suggests a\n   hardware modification to eliminate marking/padding by\
    \ adding\n   appropriate counters to Host/IMP interfaces. 65 suggests breaking\n\
    \   regular messages into two messages. 67 supports 65. 72 and 73 suggest\n  \
    \ that such changes be postponed until sufficient experience with the\n   network\
    \ is gained.\n   44 introduces the notion of double padding and presents two\n\
    \   alternative approaches when a message does not end on a Host word\n   boundary:\n\
    \      a) The host provides padding in addition to the IMPS (\"double\n      \
    \   padding\")\n      b) The host shifts messages to end on a word boundary.\n\
    \   48 explains double padding in more detail and discusses the pros and\n   cons.\
    \  A suggestion is made to use marking to adjust the word\n   baundary (alternative\
    \ b).  NWG/RFCs 49 and 50 are concurrences with\n   48.\n   70 presents a method\
    \ to handle the stripping of padding from a\n   message.\n   All NWG/RFCs in this\

    \ 9 and 22 contains some modifications to control message\n   formats presented\
    \ in 11.  The protocol was not considered powerful\n   enough because it didn't\

    \ was thrown out as a result of a network\n   meeting in December 1969.\n   33\
    \ is the basis for the current protocol.  It was presented at the\n   SJCC, 1970.\n\
    \   36 is a modification of 33.  It discusses connection establishment\n   without\
    \ switching, flow control, and introduces the idea of\n   reconnection.  Control\
    \ commands are summarized. 36 was distributed at\n   a Network meeting in March\
    \ 1970.\n   37 presents the reaction to 36 and presents ideas on reconnection\n\
    \   flow control and decoupling of links and connections.  Provisions of\n   error\

    \ of the space available.\n   57 and 59 comment on 54.\n   Document No. 1 differs\
    \ from NWG/RFC 54 as follows: commands GVB and\n   RET have been added for flow\
    \ control and error condition codes have\n   been added to ERR.  NWG/RFC 102 presents\
    \ some modifications to\n   Document No. 1: fixed lengths are specified for ECO,\

    \ current official protocol. 62 supersedes 61. 60 and 62 are worth\n   considering\
    \ for possible implementation in future protocols.\n   Hopefully, more documents\
    \ of a similar nature will be generated as\n   experience is gained with the current\
    \ protocol.\n   NWG/RFCs 65 and 68 comment on Document No. 1.\n   93 points out\
    \ an ambiguity in Document No. 1 regarding the\n   requirement of a message data\
    \ type in the message sent from server\n   socket 1.  The ambiguity is resolved\

    \   flow of messages from the sending socket to the receive socket.  The\n   official\
    \ position is stated in Document No. 1 with an unresolved\n   issue pending as\
    \ described in NWG/RFC 102.\n   In particular:\n   19 suggests that Hosts may\
    \ want the capability of agreeing to lock\n   programs into core for more efficient\
    \ core-to-core transfers.  This\n   may require different handling of RFNMs.\n\
    \   33 describes the use of RFNM (type 10 rather than 5) on a link to\n   control\
    \ flow.  A control command RSM (resume) is defined to allow the\n   host to signal\
    \ for resumption of message flow. 46 describes the same\n   technique.\n   37\
    \ describes the effect some proposed changes (for reconnect and\n   decoupling\
    \ of connections and links) would have on RFNMs and \"cease\n   on link.\"\n \
    \  46 (MIT's rewrite of protocol) introduces BLK and RSM commands as an\n   alternative\
    \ to \"cease on link\", SPD and RSM commands.\n   47 presents BBN's position that\
    \ buffering be handled by the Host, not\n   the IMP.\n   54 introduces a new flow\
    \ control mechanism in which the receiving\n   host is required to allocate buffer\
    \ space for each connection and not\n   notify the sending host of bit sizes.\
    \  A new command, ALL to allocate\n   space is sent from the receiving host to\
    \ the sending host.  With this\n   new mechanism, 33, 37, 46, and 47 become obsolete.\n\
    \   59 presents the objections of Project MAC and Lincoln Labs to the\n   flow\
    \ control mechanism introduced in 54.  Their preference is for\n   \"cease on\
    \ link\" which allocates buffer space on demand.\n   60, which defines a simplified\
    \ NCP protocol, presents a method of\n   flow control based on the requirement\
    \ that connections are full\n   duplex.\n   65 comments on Document No. 1.  With\
    \ respect to flow control, it\n   disagrees with the allocation mechanism and\
    \ the introduction of\n   irregular message to make the cease mechanism work.\n\
    \   68 proposes modifications to RFNM by defining three forms which would\n  \
    \ insure control of data and would replace the memory allocation\n   mechanism.\n\

    \ protocol design.  However, the consensus was that it\n   introduced complexities\
    \ with which the initial NCP implementations\n   did not want to cope.  The need\

    \ concept of switching connections to the Logger. 36\n   presents a scheme for\
    \ dynamic reconnection, i.e., reconnection can\n   take place after the flow is\
    \ started.\n   37 presents two methods suggested by BBN for handling reconnection.\n\

    \ has been formed to plan, implement, and\n   exercise a language for reconfiguring\
    \ data streams.\n   In particular:\n   NIL (Network Interchange Language), described\
    \ in 51, introduces the\n   concept of an abstract network machine which would\
    \ permit a user to\n   consider the computer network as an overall computing facility.\
    \  All\n   dialogue would take place between hosts and the network machine.  NIL\n\
    \   permits the description of the environment and the description of the\n  \
    \ Front End of an interactive system.  Sublanguages for describing\n   control,\
    \ operation, data declaration, and environment are used.  With\n   NIL, the network\
    \ machine can operate in standard mode as well as\n   user-defined extended mode.\
    \  The network machine can act as a user of\n   a Host; conversely, a Host can\
    \ be a user of a network machine.  Each\n   Host will have a generator to generate\
    \ a translator from the\n   descriptive sublanguage inputs.\n   DEL (Decode -\

    \ Form Machine with some examples of\n   replacement rules for particular data\
    \ types.  Application of the\n   Form-Machine to program protocols is also discussed.\n\
    \   31 proposes a message description language as a standard symbolic\n   method\
    \ for defining and describing binary messages.  In the future,\n   the descriptive\
    \ language could be used as input to generators of data\n   translation programs.\n\
    \   42 proposes the use of message data types prior to the development of\n  \
