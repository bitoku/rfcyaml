This memo defines an experimental portion of the Management Information Base (MIB) for use with network management protocols in TCP/IP based internets.
In particular, this memo defines managed objects used for managing subnetworks which use the IEEE 802.5 Token Ring technology described in 802.5 Token Ring Access Method and Physical Layer Specifications, IEEE Standard 802.5 1989.
The Internet standard Network Management Framework consists of three components.
They are: RFC 1155 which defines the SMI, the mechanisms used for describing and naming objects for the purpose of management.
RFC 1212 defines a more concise description mechanism, which is wholly consistent with the SMI.
RFC 1156 which defines MIB I, the core set of managed objects for the Internet suite of protocols.
RFC 1213, defines MIB II, an evolution of MIB I based on implementation experience and new operational requirements.
RFC 1157 which defines the SNMP, the protocol used for network access to managed objects.
The Framework permits new objects to be defined for the purpose of experimentation and evaluation.
Objects Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed the Management Information Base or MIB.
Objects in the MIB are defined using the subset of Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1)
[7] defined in the SMI.
In particular, each object has a name, a syntax, and an encoding.
The name is an object identifier, an administratively assigned name, which specifies an object type.
The object type together with an object instance serves to uniquely identify a specific instantiation of the object.
For human convenience, we often use a textual string, termed the OBJECT DESCRIPTOR, to also refer to the object type.
The syntax of an object type defines the abstract data structure corresponding to that object type.
The ASN.1 language is used for this purpose.
However, the SMI [3] purposely restricts the ASN.1 constructs which may be used.
These restrictions are explicitly made for simplicity.
The encoding of an object type is simply how that object type is represented using the object type's syntax.
Implicitly tied to the notion of an object type's syntax and encoding
is how the object type is represented when being transmitted on the network.
The SMI specifies the use of the basic encoding rules of ASN.1 [8], subject to the additional requirements imposed by the SNMP.
Format of Definitions Section 5 contains contains the specification of all object types contained in this MIB module.
The object types are defined using the conventions defined in the SMI, as amended by the extensions specified in [9,10].
This memo defines three tables: the 802.5 Interface Table, which contains state and parameter information which is specific to 802.5 interfaces, the 802.5 Statistics Table, which contains 802.5 interface statistics, and the 802.5 Timer Table, which contains the values of 802.5 defined timers.
A managed system will have one entry in the 802.5 Interface Table and one entry in the 802.5 Statistics Table for each of its 802.5 interfaces.
Implementation of the 802.5 Timer Table is optional.
This memo also defines OBJECT IDENTIFIERs, some to identify 802.5 tests, for use with the ifExtnsTestTable defined in [11], and some to identify Token Ring interface Chip Sets, for use with the ifExtnsChipSet object defined in [11].
All objects defined in this memo are registered in a single subtree within the experimental namespace [3], and are for use with every interface which conforms to the IEEE 802.5 Token Ring Access Method and Physical Layer Specifications [10].
At present, this applies to interfaces for which the ifType variable in the Internet standard MIB [4,6] has the value: iso88025 tokenRing(9)
A new datatype, MacAddress, is introduced as a textual convention in this document.
This textual convention has NO effect on either the syntax nor the semantics of any managed object.
Objects defined using this convention are always encoded by means of the rules that define their primitive type.
Hence, no changes to the SMI or the SNMP are necessary to accommodate this textual convention which is adopted merely for the convenience of readers.

This MIB Module uses the extended OBJECT TYPE macro as    defined in [9].
least significant bit first, even though 802.5 (in   contrast to other 802.x protocols) requires MAC addresses   to be transmitted most significant bit first.
16 bit addresses, if needed, are represented by setting   their upper 4 octets to all 0's, i.e., AAFF would be   represented as 00000000AAFF.
This table contains state and parameter information which   is specific to 802.5 interfaces.
It is mandatory that   systems having 802.5 interfaces implement this table in   addition to the generic interfaces table [4,6] and its   generic extensions [11].

"The value of this object identifies the 802.5 interface for which this entry contains management information.
The value of this object for a particular interface has the same value as the ifIndex object, defined in [4,6], for the same interface."
INTEGER { no op(1), open(2), reset(3), close(4)
When this object is set to the value of open(2), the station should go into the open state.
The progress and success of the open is given by the values of the objects dot5RingState and dot5RingOpenStatus.
When this object is set to the value of reset(3), then the station should do a reset.
On a reset, all MIB counters should retain their values, if possible.
Other side affects are dependent on the hardware chip set.
When this object is set to the value of close(4), the station should go into the stopped state by removing itself from the ring.
Setting this object to a value of no op(1) has no effect.
When read, this object always has a value of no op(1)."
INTEGER ACCESS  read only STATUS  mandatory DESCRIPTION
"The current interface status which can be used to diagnose fluctuating problems that can occur on token rings, after a station has successfully been added to the ring.

The object's value is a sum of values, one for each currently applicable condition.
The following values are defined for various conditions: 0
No Problems detected 32   Ring Recovery 64

A table containing Token Ring statistics, one entry per 802.5 interface.
All the statistics are defined using the syntax Counter as 32 bit wrap around counters.
Thus, if an interface's hardware maintains these statistics in 16 bit counters, then the agent must read the hardware's counters frequently enough to prevent loss of significance, in order to maintain 32 bit counters in software."

The extensions to the interfaces table proposed in [11]
define a table object, ifExtnsTestTable, through which a   network manager can instruct an agent to test an interface   for various faults.
A test to be performed is identified   (as the value of ifExtnsTestType) via an OBJECT IDENTIFIER.
causes the   interface to check the path from memory through the   chip set's internal logic and back to memory, thus   checking the proper functioning of the systems's   interface to the chip set.
The Insert Function test is defined by: testInsertFunc
Invoking this test causes the station to test the insert   ring logic of the hardware if the station's lobe media   cable is connected to a wiring concentrator.
Note that   this command inserts the station into the network, and   thus
, could cause problems if the station is connected   to a operational network.
The extensions to the interfaces table proposed in [11]
define an object, ifExtnsChipSet, with the syntax of   OBJECT IDENTIFIER, to identify the hardware chip set in   use by an interface.
This MIB defines the following for use as values of   ifExtnsChipSet:
