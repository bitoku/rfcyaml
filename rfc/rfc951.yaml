  title: 1. Status of this Memo
- contents:
  - "2. Overview\n   This RFC describes an IP/UDP bootstrap protocol (BOOTP) which
    allows\n   a diskless client machine to discover its own IP address, the address\n
    \  of a server host, and the name of a file to be loaded into memory and\n   executed.
    \ The bootstrap operation can be thought of as consisting of\n   TWO PHASES.  This
    RFC describes the first phase, which could be\n   labeled 'address determination
    and bootfile selection'.  After this\n   address and filename information is obtained,
    control passes to the\n   second phase of the bootstrap where a file transfer
    occurs.  The file\n   transfer will typically use the TFTP protocol [9], since
    it is\n   intended that both phases reside in PROM on the client.  However\n   BOOTP
    could also work with other protocols such as SFTP [3] or\n   FTP [6].\n   We suggest
    that the client's PROM software provide a way to do a\n   complete bootstrap without
    'user' interaction.  This is the type of\n   boot that would occur during an unattended
    power-up.  A mechanism\n   should be provided for the user to manually supply
    the necessary\n   address and filename information to bypass the BOOTP protocol
    and\n   enter the file transfer phase directly.  If non-volatile storage is\n
    \  available, we suggest keeping default settings there and bypassing\n   the
    BOOTP protocol unless these settings cause the file transfer\n   phase to fail.
    \ If the cached information fails, the bootstrap should\n   fall back to phase
    1 and use BOOTP.\n   Here is a brief outline of the protocol:\n      1. A single
    packet exchange is performed.  Timeouts are used to\n      retransmit until a
    reply is received.  The same packet field\n      layout is used in both directions.
    \ Fixed length fields of maximum\n      reasonable length are used to simplify
    structure definition and\n      parsing.\n      2. An 'opcode' field exists with
    two values.  The client\n      broadcasts a 'bootrequest' packet.  The server
    then answers with a\n      'bootreply' packet.  The bootrequest contains the client's\n
    \     hardware address and its IP address, if known.\n"
  title: 2. Overview
- contents:
  - "Bootstrap Protocol\n      3. The request can optionally contain the name of the
    server the\n      client wishes to respond.  This is so the client can force the\n
    \     boot to occur from a specific host (e.g. if multiple versions of\n      the
    same bootfile exist or if the server is in a far distant\n      net/domain).  The
    client does not have to deal with name / domain\n      services; instead this
    function is pushed off to the BOOTP server.\n      4. The request can optionally
    contain the 'generic' filename to be\n      booted.  For example 'unix' or 'ethertip'.
    \ When the server sends\n      the bootreply, it replaces this field with the
    fully qualified\n      path name of the appropriate boot file.  In determining
    this name,\n      the server may consult his own database correlating the client's\n
    \     address and filename request, with a particular boot file\n      customized
    for that client.  If the bootrequest filename is a null\n      string, then the
    server returns a filename field indicating the\n      'default' file to be loaded
    for that client.\n      5. In the case of clients who do not know their IP addresses,
    the\n      server must also have a database relating hardware address to IP\n
    \     address.  This client IP address is then placed into a field in\n      the
    bootreply.\n      6. Certain network topologies (such as Stanford's) may be such\n
    \     that a given physical cable does not have a TFTP server directly\n      attached
    to it (e.g. all the gateways and hosts on a certain cable\n      may be diskless).
    \ With the cooperation of neighboring gateways,\n      BOOTP can allow clients
    to boot off of servers several hops away,\n      through these gateways.  See
    the section 'Booting Through\n      Gateways' below.  This part of the protocol
    requires no special\n      action on the part of the client.  Implementation is
    optional and\n      requires a small amount of additional code in gateways and\n
    \     servers.\n"

    \ The BOOTP\n   packet is enclosed in a standard IP [8] UDP [7] datagram.  For\n
    \  simplicity it is assumed that the BOOTP packet is never fragmented.\n   Any
    numeric fields shown are packed in 'standard network byte order',\n   i.e. high
    order bits are sent first.\n   In the IP header of a bootrequest, the client fills
    in its own IP\n   source address if known, otherwise zero.  When the server address
    is\n   unknown, the IP destination address will be the 'broadcast address'\n   255.255.255.255.
    \ This address means 'broadcast on the local cable,\n   (I don't know my net number)'
    [4].\n"
  title: 3. Packet Format

  - "Bootstrap Protocol\n   The UDP header contains source and destination port numbers.
    \ The\n   BOOTP protocol uses two reserved port numbers, 'BOOTP client' (68)\n
    \  and 'BOOTP server' (67).  The client sends requests using 'BOOTP\n   server'
    as the destination port; this is usually a broadcast.  The\n   server sends replies
    using 'BOOTP client' as the destination port;\n   depending on the kernel or driver
    facilities in the server, this may\n   or may not be a broadcast (this is explained
    further in the section\n   titled 'Chicken/Egg issues' below).  The reason TWO
    reserved ports\n   are used, is to avoid 'waking up' and scheduling the BOOTP
    server\n   daemons, when a bootreply must be broadcast to a client.  Since the\n
    \  server and other hosts won't be listening on the 'BOOTP client' port,\n   any
    such incoming broadcasts will be filtered out at the kernel\n   level.  We could
    not simply allow the client to pick a 'random' port\n   number for the UDP source
    port field; since the server reply may be\n   broadcast, a randomly chosen port
    number could confuse other hosts\n   that happened to be listening on that port.\n
    \  The UDP length field is set to the length of the UDP plus BOOTP\n   portions
    of the packet.  The UDP checksum field can be set to zero by\n   the client (or
    server) if desired, to avoid this extra overhead in a\n   PROM implementation.

    \     1. If the client knows its own IP address ('ciaddr' field is\n      nonzero),
    then the IP can be sent 'as normal', since the client\n      will respond to ARPs
    [5].\n      2. If the client does not yet know its IP address (ciaddr zero),\n
    \     then the client cannot respond to ARPs sent by the transmitter of\n      the

    \ Of\n         course, this entry should have a timeout on it, just like any\n
    \        other entry made by the normal ARP code itself.  The\n         transmitter
    of the bootreply can then simply send the bootreply\n         to the client's

    of ARP, e.g. the\n   address cache could be just one entry in size.  This will
    allow a\n   second-phase-only boot (TFTP) to be performed when the client knows\n
    \  the IP addresses and bootfile name.\n   Any time the client is expecting to
    receive a TFTP or BOOTP reply, it\n   should be prepared to answer an ARP request
    for its own IP to\n   hardware address mapping (if known).\n   Since the bootreply
    will contain (in the hardware encapsulation) the\n   hardware source address of
    the server/gateway, the client MAY be able\n   to avoid sending an ARP request
    for the server/gateway IP address to\n   be used in the following TFTP phase.
    \ However this should be treated\n   only as a special case, since it is desirable
    to still allow a\n   second-phase-only boot as described above.\n"

    (RARP) [1]\n   was proposed to allow a client to determine its IP address, given\n
    \  that it knew its hardware address.  However RARP had the disadvantage\n   that
    it was a hardware link level protocol (not IP/UDP based).  This\n   means that
    RARP could only be implemented on hosts containing special\n   kernel or driver
    modifications to access these 'raw' packets.  Since\n   there are many network
    kernels existent now, with each source\n   maintained by different organizations,
    a boot protocol that does not\n   require kernel modifications is a decided advantage.\n
    \  BOOTP provides this hardware to IP address lookup function, in\n   addition
    to the other useful features described in the sections\n   above.\n"

    packet for the first time, it is a good idea\n      to clear the entire packet
    buffer to all zeros; this will place\n      all fields in their default state.
    \ The client then creates a\n      packet with the following fields.\n      The
    IP destination address is set to 255.255.255.255.  (the\n      broadcast address)
    or to the server's IP address (if known).  The\n      IP source address and 'ciaddr'
    are set to the client's IP address\n      if known, else 0.  The UDP header is
    set with the proper length;\n      source port = 'BOOTP client' port destination
    port = 'BOOTP\n      server' port.\n      'op' is set to '1', BOOTREQUEST.  'htype'
    is set to the hardware\n      address type as assigned in the ARP section of the
    \"Assigned\n      Numbers\" RFC. 'hlen' is set to the length of the hardware address,\n
    \     e.g. '6' for 10mb ethernet.\n      'xid' is set to a 'random' transaction
    id.  'secs' is set to the\n      number of seconds that have elapsed since the
    client has started\n      booting.  This will let the servers know how long a
    client has\n      been trying.  As the number gets larger, certain servers may
    feel\n      more 'sympathetic' towards a client they don't normally service.\n
    \     If a client lacks a suitable clock, it could construct a rough\n      estimate
    using a loop timer.  Or it could choose to simply send\n      this field as always
    a fixed value, say 100 seconds.\n      If the client knows its IP address, 'ciaddr'
    (and the IP source\n      address) are set to this value.  'chaddr' is filled
    in with the\n      client's hardware address.\n      If the client wishes to restrict
    booting to a particular server\n      name, it may place a null-terminated string
    in 'sname'.  The name\n      used should be any of the allowable names or nicknames
    of the\n      desired host.\n      The client has several options for filling
    the 'file' name field.\n      If left null, the meaning is 'I want to boot the
    default file for\n      my machine'.  A null file name can also mean 'I am only
    interested\n      in finding out client/server/gateway IP addresses, I dont care\n
    \     about file names'.\n      The field can also be a 'generic' name such as

    \     vendor-specific strings or structures.  For example the machine\n      hardware
    type or serial number may be placed here.  However the\n      operation of the
    BOOTP server should not DEPEND on this\n      information existing.\n      If

    be the first item within 'vend'.  This lets a\n      server determine what kind
    of information it is seeing in this\n      field.  Numbers can be assigned by

    checksum.]\n   7.2. Client Retransmission Strategy\n      If no reply is received
    for a certain length of time, the client\n      should retransmit the request.
    \ The time interval must be chosen\n      carefully so as not to flood the network.
    \ Consider the case of a\n      cable containing 100 machines that are just coming
    up after a\n      power failure.  Simply retransmitting the request every four\n
    \     seconds will inundate the net.\n      As a possible strategy, you might
    consider backing off\n      exponentially, similar to the way ethernet backs off
    on a\n      collision.  So for example if the first packet is at time 0:00,\n
    \     the second would be at :04, then :08, then :16, then :32, then\n      :64.
    \ You should also randomize each time; this would be done\n      similar to the
    ethernet specification by starting with a mask and\n      'and'ing that with with
    a random number to get the first backoff.\n      On each succeeding backoff, the
    mask is increased in length by one\n      bit.  This doubles the average delay
    on each backoff.\n      After the 'average' backoff reaches about 60 seconds,
    it should be\n      increased no further, but still randomized.\n      Before
    each retransmission, the client should update the 'secs'\n      field. [UDP checksum.]\n"

    some additional\n   code in cooperating gateways and servers, but it allows cross-gateway\n
    \  booting.  This is mainly useful when gateways are diskless machines.\n   Gateways
    containing disks (e.g. a UNIX machine acting as a gateway),\n   might as well
    run their own BOOTP/TFTP servers.\n   Gateways listening to broadcast BOOTREQUESTs
    may decide to forward or\n   rebroadcast these requests 'when appropriate'.  For
    example, the\n"

    a list of\n   other networks or hosts to receive a copy of any broadcast\n   BOOTREQUESTs.
    \ Even though a 'hops' field exists, it is a poor idea\n   to simply globally
    rebroadcast the requests, since broadcast loops\n   will almost certainly occur.\n
    \  The forwarding could begin immediately, or wait until the 'secs'\n   (seconds
    client has been trying) field passes a certain threshold.\n   If a gateway does
    decide to forward the request, it should look at\n   the 'giaddr' (gateway IP
    address) field.  If zero, it should plug its\n   own IP address (on the receiving
    cable) into this field.  It may also\n   use the 'hops' field to optionally control
    how far the packet is\n   reforwarded. Hops should be incremented on each forwarding.
    \ For\n   example, if hops passes '3', the packet should probably be discarded.\n
    \  [UDP checksum.]\n   Here we have recommended placing this special forwarding
    function in\n   the gateways.  But that does not have to be the case.  As long
    as\n   some 'BOOTP forwarding agent' exists on the net with the booting\n   client,
    the agent can do the forwarding when appropriate.  Thus this\n   service may or
    may not be co-located with the gateway.\n   In the case of a forwarding agent
    not located in the gateway, the\n   agent could save himself some work by plugging
    the broadcast address\n   of the interface receiving the bootrequest into the
    'giaddr' field.\n   Thus the reply would get forwarded using normal gateways,
    not\n   involving the forwarding agent.  Of course the disadvantage here is\n
    \  that you lose the ability to use the 'Egg' non-broadcast method of\n   sending
    the reply, causing extra overhead for every host on the\n   client cable.\n"

    database that the BOOTP\n   server program might use.  The database has two sections,
    delimited\n   by a line containing an percent in column 1.  The first section\n
    \  contains a 'default directory' and mappings from generic names to\n   directory/pathnames.
    \ The first generic name in this section is the\n   'default file' you get when
    the bootrequest contains a null 'file'\n   string.\n   The second section maps
    hardware addresstype/address into an\n   ipaddress. Optionally you can also overide
    the default generic name\n   by supplying a ipaddress specific genericname.  A
    'suffix' item is\n   also an option; if supplied, any generic names specified
