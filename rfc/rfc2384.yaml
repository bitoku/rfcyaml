  - "1.  Introduction\n   [POP3] is a widely-deployed mail access protocol.  Many
    programs\n   access POP3 message stores, and thus need POP3 configuration\n   information.
    \ Since there are multiple configuration elements which\n   are required in order
    to access a mailbox, a single string\n   representation is convenient.\n   A POP3
    mailbox (like an [IMAP4] mailbox) is a network resource, and\n   URLs are a widely-supported
    generalized representation of network\n   resources.\n   A means of specifying
    a POP3 mailbox as a URL will likely be useful\n   in many programs and protocols.
    [ACAP] is one case where a string\n   encapsulation of elements required to access
    network services is\n   needed.  For example, an [IMAP4] message store is usually
    specified\n   in ACAP datasets as an [IMAP-URL].\n   This memo defines a URL scheme
    for referencing a POP mailbox.\n"

  - "3.  POP Scheme\n   The POP URL scheme designates a POP server, and optionally
    a port\n   number, authentication mechanism, authentication ID, and/or\n   authorization
    ID.\n   The POP URL follows the common Internet scheme syntax as defined in\n
    \  RFC 1738 [BASIC-URL] except that clear text passwords are not\n   permitted.
    \ If :<port> is omitted, the port defaults to 110.\n   The POP URL is described
    using [ABNF] in Section 8.\n   A POP URL is of the general form:\n        pop://<user>;auth=<auth>@<host>:<port>\n
    \  Where <user>, <host>, and <port> are as defined in RFC 1738, and some\n   or
    all of the elements, except \"pop://\" and <host>, may be omitted.\n"

  - "4.  POP User Name and Authentication Mechanism\n   An authorization (which mailbox
    to access) and authentication (whose\n   password to check against) identity (referred
    to as \"user name\" for\n   simplicity) and/or authentication mechanism name may
    be supplied.\n   These are used in a \"USER\", \"APOP\", \"AUTH\" [POP-AUTH],
    or extension\n   command after making the connection to the POP server.  If the
    URL\n   doesn't supply an authentication identifier, the program interpreting\n
    \  the POP URL SHOULD request one from the user.\n   An authentication mechanism
    can be expressed by adding \";AUTH=<enc-\n   auth-type>\" to the end of the user
    name.  If the authentication\n   mechanism name is not preceded by a \"+\", it
    is a SASL POP [SASL]\n   mechanism.  If it is preceded by a \"+\", it is either
    \"APOP\" or an\n   extension mechanism.\n   When an <enc-auth-type> is specified,
    the client SHOULD request\n   appropriate credentials from that mechanism and
    use the \"AUTH\",\n   \"APOP\", or extension command instead of the \"USER\" command.
    \ If no\n   user name is specified, one SHOULD be obtained from the mechanism
    or\n   requested from the user as appropriate.\n   The string \";AUTH=*\" indicates
    that the client SHOULD select an\n   appropriate authentication mechanism.  It
    MAY use any mechanism\n   supported by the POP server.\n   If an <enc-auth-type>
    other than \";AUTH=*\" is specified, the client\n   SHOULD NOT use a different
    mechanism without explicit user\n   permission.\n   If a user name is included
    with no authentication mechanism, then\n   \";AUTH=*\" is assumed.\n   Since URLs
    can easily come from untrusted sources, care must be taken\n   when resolving
    a URL which requires or requests any sort of\n   authentication.  If authentication
    credentials are supplied to the\n   wrong server, it may compromise the security
    of the user's account.\n   The program resolving the URL should make sure it meets
    at least one\n   of the following criteria in this case:\n   (1) The URL comes
    from a trusted source, such as a referral server\n   which the client has validated
    and trusts according to site policy.\n   Note that user entry of the URL may or
    may not count as a trusted\n   source, depending on the experience level of the
    user and site\n   policy.\n   (2) Explicit local site policy permits the client
    to connect to the\n   server in the URL.  For example, if the client knows the
    site domain\n   name, site policy may dictate that any hostname ending in that
    domain\n   is trusted.\n   (3) The user confirms that connecting to that domain
    name with the\n   specified credentials and/or mechanism is permitted.\n   (4)
    A mechanism is used which validates the server before passing\n   potentially
    compromising client credentials.\n   (5) An authentication mechanism is used which
    will not reveal\n   information to the server which could be used to compromise
    future\n   connections.\n   A URL containing \";AUTH=*\" should be treated with
    extra care since it\n   might fall back on a weaker security mechanism. Finally,
    clients are\n   discouraged from using a plain text password as a fallback with\n
    \  \";AUTH=*\" unless the connection has strong encryption (e.g., a key\n   length
    of greater than 56 bits).\n   Note that if unsafe or reserved characters such
    as \" \" or \";\" are\n   present in the user name or authentication mechanism,
    they MUST be\n   encoded as described in RFC 1738 [BASIC-URL].\n"

    might\n   translate various POP URLs into a series of POP commands. Commands\n
    \  sent from the client to the server are prefixed with \"C:\", and\n   responses
    sent from the server to the client are prefixed with \"S:\".\n   The URL:\n        <pop://rg@mailsrv.qualcomm.com>\n
    \  Results in the following client commands:\n        <request password from user>\n

    specification and the\n   [BASIC-URL] specification are relevant.  Security considerations\n

    \  Many email clients store the plain text password for later use after\n   logging
    into a POP server.  Such clients MUST NOT use a stored\n   password in response
    to a POP URL without explicit permission from\n   the user to supply that password
    to the specified host name.\n"
