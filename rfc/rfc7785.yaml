  - "1.  Introduction\n   IPv6 deployment models assume IPv6 prefixes are delegated\
    \ by Service\n   Providers to the connected CPEs (Customer Premises Equipment)\
    \ or\n   hosts, which in turn derive IPv6 addresses from that prefix.  In the\n\
    \   case of Dual-Stack Lite (DS-Lite) [RFC6333], which is an IPv4 service\n  \
    \ continuity mechanism over an IPv6 network, the Basic Bridging\n   BroadBand\
    \ (B4) element derives an IPv6 address for the IPv4-in-IPv6\n   softwire setup\
    \ purposes.\n   The B4 element might obtain a new IPv6 address for a variety of\n\
    \   reasons that include (but are not limited to) a reboot of the CPE,\n   power\
    \ outage, DHCPv6 lease expiry, or other actions undertaken by the\n   Service\
    \ Provider.  If this occurs, traffic forwarded to a B4's\n   previous IPv6 address\
    \ may never reach its destination or may be\n   delivered to another B4 that now\
    \ uses the address formerly assigned\n   to the original B4.  This situation affects\
    \ all mapping types, both\n   implicit (e.g., by sending a TCP SYN) and explicit\
    \ (e.g., using Port\n   Control Protocol (PCP) [RFC6887]).  The problem is further\
    \ elaborated\n   in Section 2.\n   This document proposes recommendations to soften\
    \ the impact of such\n   renumbering issues (Section 4).\n   This document complements\
    \ [RFC6908].\n"

- title: 2.  The Problem
  contents:
  - "2.  The Problem\n   Since private IPv4 addresses assigned to hosts serviced by\
    \ a B4\n   element overlap across multiple CPEs, the IPv6 address of a B4\n  \
    \ element plays a key role in demultiplexing connections, enforcing\n   policies,\
    \ and in identifying associated resources assigned for each\n   of the connections\
    \ maintained by the Address Family Transition Router\n   (AFTR) [RFC6333].  For\
    \ example, these resources maintain state of\n   Endpoint-Independent Mapping\
    \ (EIM) as defined in Section 4.1 of\n   [RFC4787], Endpoint-Independent Filtering\
    \ (EIF) as defined in\n   Section 5 of [RFC4787], preserve the external IPv4 address\
    \ assigned\n   in the AFTR (i.e., \"IP address pooling\" behavior as defined in\n\
    \   Section 4.1 of [RFC4787]), PCP mappings, etc.\n   However, the IPv6 address\
    \ used by the B4 element may change for some\n   reason, e.g., because of a change\
    \ in the CPE itself or because of\n   privacy extensions enabled for generating\
    \ the IPv6 address (e.g.,\n   [RFC7217] or [RFC4941]).  Whenever the B4's IPv6\
    \ address changes, the\n   associated mappings created in the AFTR are no longer\
    \ valid.  This\n   may result in the creation of a new set of mappings in the\
    \ AFTR.\n   Furthermore, a misbehaving user may be tempted to change the B4's\n\
    \   IPv6 address in order to \"grab\" more ports and resources at the AFTR\n \
    \  side.  This behavior can be seen as a potential denial-of-service\n   (DoS)\
    \ attack from misbehaving users.  Note that this DoS attack can\n   be achieved\
    \ whatever the port assignment policy enforced by the AFTR\n   may be (individual\
    \ ports, port sets, randomized port bulks, etc.).\n   Service Providers may want\
    \ to enforce policies in order to limit the\n   usage of the AFTR resources on\
    \ a per-subscriber basis for fairness of\n   resource usage (see REQ-4 of [RFC6888]).\
    \  These policies are used for\n   dimensioning purposes and also to ensure that\
    \ AFTR resources are not\n   exhausted.  If the derived B4's IPv6 address can\
    \ change, resource\n   tracking using that address will give incomplete results.\
    \  Also,\n   whenever the B4's IPv6 address changes, enforcing policies based\
    \ on\n   that address doesn't resolve stale mappings hanging around in the\n \
    \  system, consuming not only system resources, but also reducing the\n   available\
    \ quota of resources per subscriber.  Clearing those mappings\n   can be envisaged,\
    \ but that will cause a lot of churn in the AFTR and\n   could be disruptive to\
    \ existing connections; this is not desirable.\n   More concretely, if stale mappings\
    \ have not been migrated to the new\n   B4's IPv6 address so that packets can\
    \ be forwarded to the appropriate\n   B4, all incoming packets that are associated\
    \ with those mappings will\n   be rejected by the AFTR.  Such behavior is not\
    \ desirable because it's\n   detrimental to quality of experience.\n   When application\
    \ servers are hosted behind a B4 element, and when\n   there is a change of the\
    \ B4's IPv6 address that results in a change\n   of the external IPv4 address\
    \ and/or the external port number at the\n   AFTR side, these servers have to\
    \ advertise their change (see\n   Section 1.1 of [RFC7393]).  Some means to discover\
    \ the change of B4's\n   IPv6 address, the external IPv4 address, and/or the external\
    \ port are\n   therefore required.  Latency issues are likely to be experienced\
    \ when\n   an application server has to advertise its newly assigned external\n\
    \   IPv4 address and port, and the application clients have to discover\n   that\
    \ newly assigned address and/or port and re-initiate connections\n   with the\
    \ application server.\n   A solution to these problems is to enforce policies\
    \ based on the IPv6\n   prefix assigned to subscribers that have DS-Lite service\
    \ instead of\n   based on the B4's IPv6 address.  Section 3 introduces the subscriber-\n\
    \   mask that is meant to derive the IPv6 prefix assigned to a\n   subscriber's\
    \ CPE from the source IPv6 address of a packet received\n   from a B4 element.\n"
- title: 3.  Introducing Subscriber-Mask
  contents:
  - "3.  Introducing Subscriber-Mask\n   The subscriber-mask is defined as an integer\
    \ that indicates the\n   length of significant bits to be applied on the source\
    \ IPv6 address\n   (internal side) to identify unambiguously a CPE.\n   Subscriber-mask\
    \ is an AFTR system-wide configuration parameter that\n   is used to enforce generic\
    \ per-subscriber policies.  Applying these\n   generic policies does not require\
    \ configuring every subscriber's\n   prefix.\n   Subscriber-mask must be configurable;\
    \ the default value is 56.  The\n   default value is motivated by current practices\
    \ to assign IPv6 prefix\n   lengths of /56 to end-sites (e.g., [RIPE], [LACNIC]).\n\
    \   Example: suppose the 2001:db8:100:100::/56 prefix is assigned to a\n   CPE\
    \ that is DS-Lite enabled.  Suppose also that the\n   2001:db8:100:100::1 address\
    \ is the IPv6 address used by the B4\n   element that resides in that CPE.  When\
    \ the AFTR receives a packet\n   from this B4 element (i.e., the source address\
    \ of the IPv4-in-IPv6\n   packet is 2001:db8:100:100::1), the AFTR applies the\
    \ subscriber-mask\n   (e.g., 56) on the source IPv6 address to compute the associated\n\
    \   prefix for this B4 element (that is, 2001:db8:100:100::/56).  Then,\n   the\
    \ AFTR enforces policies based on that prefix\n   (2001:db8:100:100::/56), not\
    \ on the exact source IPv6 address.\n"
- title: 4.  Recommendations
  contents:
  - "4.  Recommendations\n   In order to mitigate the issues discussed in Section\
    \ 2, the following\n   recommendations are made:\n   1.  A policy SHOULD be enforced\
    \ at the AFTR to limit the number of\n       active DS-Lite softwires per subscriber.\
    \  The default value MUST\n       be 1.\n          This policy aims to prevent\
    \ a misbehaving subscriber from\n          mounting several DS-Lite softwires\
    \ that would consume\n          additional AFTR resources (e.g., get more external\
    \ ports if\n          the quota were enforced on a per-softwire basis, consume\
    \ extra\n          processing due to a large number of active softwires).\n  \
    \ 2.  Resource contexts created and maintained by the AFTR SHOULD be\n       based\
    \ on the delegated IPv6 prefix instead of the B4's IPv6\n       address.  The\
    \ AFTR derives the delegated prefix from the B4's\n       IPv6 address by means\
    \ of a configured subscriber-mask\n       (Section 3).  Administrators SHOULD\
    \ configure per-prefix limits\n       of resource usage, instead of per-tunnel\
    \ limits.  These resources\n       include the maximum number of active flows,\
    \ the maximum number of\n       PCP-created mappings, NAT pool resources, etc.\n\
    \   3.  In the event a new IPv6 address is assigned to the B4 element,\n     \
    \  the AFTR SHOULD migrate existing state to be bound to the new\n       IPv6\
    \ address.  This operation ensures that traffic destined to\n       the previous\
    \ B4's IPv6 address will be redirected to the newer\n       B4's IPv6 address.\
    \  The destination IPv6 address for tunneling\n       return traffic from the\
    \ AFTR SHOULD be the last seen as the B4's\n       IPv6 source address from the\
    \ CPE.\n          This recommendation avoids stale mappings at the AFTR and\n\
    \          minimizes the risk of service disruption for subscribers.\n       \
    \   The AFTR uses the subscriber-mask to determine whether two\n          IPv6\
    \ addresses belong to the same CPE (e.g., if the\n          subscriber-mask is\
    \ set to 56, the AFTR concludes that\n          2001:db8:100:100::1 and 2001:db8:100:100::2\
    \ belong to the same\n          CPE assigned with 2001:db8:100:100::/56).\n  \
    \        As discussed in Section 5, changing the source B4's IPv6\n          address\
    \ may be used as an attack vector.  Packets with a new\n          B4's IPv6 address\
    \ from the same prefix SHOULD be rate-limited.\n          It is RECOMMENDED to\
    \ set this rate limit to 30 minutes; other\n          values can be set on a per-deployment\
    \ basis.\n          One side effect of migrating mapping state is that a server\n\
    \          deployed behind an AFTR does not need to update its DNS\n         \
    \ records (if any) by means of dynamic DNS, for example.  If a\n          dedicated\
    \ mapping is instantiated, migrating the state during\n          its validity\
    \ lifetime will ensure that the same external IP\n          address and port are\
    \ assigned to that server.\n   4.  In the event of change of the CPE WAN's IPv6\
    \ prefix, unsolicited\n       PCP ANNOUNCE messages SHOULD be sent by the B4 element\
    \ to\n       internal hosts connected to the PCP-capable CPE so that they\n  \
    \     update their mappings accordingly.\n          This allows internal PCP clients\
    \ to update their mappings with\n          the new B4's IPv6 address and to trigger\
    \ updates to rendezvous\n          servers (e.g., dynamic DNS).  A PCP-based dynamic\
    \ DNS solution\n          is specified in [RFC7393].\n   5.  When a new prefix\
    \ is assigned to the CPE, stale mappings may\n       exist in the AFTR.  This\
    \ will consume both implicit and explicit\n       resources.  In order to avoid\
    \ such issues, stable IPv6 prefix\n       assignment is RECOMMENDED.\n   6.  If\
    \ for any reason an IPv6 prefix has to be reassigned, it is\n       RECOMMENDED\
    \ to reassign an IPv6 prefix (that was previously\n       assigned to a given\
    \ CPE) to another CPE only when all the\n       resources in use associated with\
    \ that prefix are cleared from the\n       AFTR.  Doing so avoids redirecting\
    \ traffic, destined to the\n       previous prefix owner, to the new one.\n"
- title: 5.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "5.  Security Considerations\n   Security considerations related to DS-Lite are\
    \ discussed in\n   [RFC6333].\n   Enforcing the recommendations documented in\
    \ Section 4 together with\n   rate-limiting softwires with new source IPv6 addresses\
    \ from the same\n   prefix defend against DoS attacks that would result in varying\
    \ the\n   B4's IPv6 address to exhaust AFTR resources.  A misbehaving CPE can\n\
    \   be blacklisted by enforcing appropriate policies based on the prefix\n   derived\
    \ from the subscriber-mask.\n"
- title: 6.  Privacy Considerations
  contents:
  - "6.  Privacy Considerations\n   A CPE connected to a DS-Lite network is identified\
    \ by a set of\n   information that is specific to each network domain (e.g., service\n\
    \   credentials, device identifiers, etc.).  This document does not make\n   any\
    \ assumption nor introduce new requirements on how such\n   identification is\
    \ implemented network-wide.\n   This document adheres to Sections 6 and 8 of [RFC6333]\
    \ for handling\n   IPv4-in-IPv6 packets and IPv4 translation operations.  In particular,\n\
    \   this document does not leak extra information in packets exiting a\n   DS-Lite\
    \ network domain.\n   The recommendations in Section 4 (item 6, in particular)\
    \ ensure that\n   the traffic is forwarded to a legitimate CPE.  If those\n  \
    \ recommendations are not implemented, privacy concerns may arise.  For\n   example,\
    \ if an IPv6 prefix is reassigned while mapping entries\n   associated with that\
    \ prefix are still active in the AFTR, sensitive\n   data that belong to a previous\
    \ prefix owner may be disclosed to the\n   new prefix owner.\n   These recommendations\
    \ do not interfere with privacy extensions for\n   generating IPv6 addresses (e.g.,\
    \ [RFC7217] or [RFC4941]).  These\n   recommendations allow a CPE to generate\
    \ new IPv6 addresses with\n   privacy extensions without experiencing DS-Lite\
    \ service degradation.\n   Even if activating privacy extensions makes it more\
    \ difficult to\n   track a CPE over time when compared to using a permanent Interface\n\
    \   Identifier, tracking a CPE is still possible based on the first 64\n   bits\
    \ of the IPv6 address.  This is even exacerbated for deployments\n   relying on\
    \ stable IPv6 prefixes.\n   This document does not nullify the privacy effects\
    \ that may motivate\n   the use of non-stable IPv6 prefixes.  Particularly, the\
    \ subscriber-\n   mask does not enable identifying a CPE across renumbering (even\n\
    \   within a DS-Lite network domain).  This document mitigates some of\n   the\
    \ undesired effects of reassigning an IPv6 prefix to another CPE\n   (e.g., update\
    \ a rendezvous service, clear stale mappings).\n"
