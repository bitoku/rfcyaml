  - "                       ON LINE HOSTNAMES SERVICE\nWe agree with the suggestion\
    \ in RFC 623 that more than one Host should\nbe responsible for maintaining a\
    \ copy of the Hostnames data base. The\nand make it available to any secondary\
    \ Host that volunteers to maintain\na copy. We would be pleased to have UCSB serve\
    \ as one of the secondary\nHosts.\nHowever, we disagree with the suggestion in\
    \ RFC 623 that a server\nprocess should  be implemented to give user processes\
    \ access to the\nofficial Hostnames file at the NIC.  The file in question is\
    \ a\nsequential file and it seems to us that FTP is entirely appropriate for\n\
    this need.  As far as setting up common login parameters among the\nservers, this\
    \ doesn't appear to be a major problem.  Even with a\nuser/server process there\
    \ would be a requirement for additional protocol\nagreements, so it doesn't seem\
    \ that much of an added burden to decide on\ncommon login parameters when using\
    \  FTP.\nWe are puzzled by the apparent distaste for FTP.  In our opinion the\n\
    goal has been to set up a network file transfer mechanism that everyone\ncan use\
    \ for a variety of needs without further programming required.  If\nFTP is that\
    \ bad, shouldn't the criticism and work be directed towards\nimproving or replacing\
    \ it, rather than making end runs around it?  FTP\nis surely more complex than\
    \ is required for any particular application\nincluding this one, but isn't that\
    \ true by definition of a general\nfacility?\nWe also prefer to maintain the file\
    \ in ASCII.  It is easier, it seems to\nus, to check out data or data transfer\
    \ problems in that form rather than\nin binary.\n       [ This RFC was put into\
    \ machine readable form for entry ]\n       [ into the online RFC archives by\
