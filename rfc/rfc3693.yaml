    \   management of equipment in the field, and other location-dependent\n   services\
    \ need geographic location information about a Target (such as\n   a user, resource\

    \  Specifically, it\n   describes the requirements for the Geopriv Location Object\
    \ (LO) and\n   for the protocols that use this Location Object.  This LO is\n\
    \   envisioned to be the primary data structure used in all Geopriv\n   protocol\

  - "1.  Overview\n   Location-based services (applications that require geographic\n\
    \   location information as input) are becoming increasingly common.  The\n  \
    \ collection and transfer of location information about a particular\n   Target\
    \ can have important privacy implications.  A key goal of the\n   protocol described\
    \ in this document is to facilitate the protection\n   of privacy pursuant to\
    \ Privacy Rules set by the \"user/owner of the\n   Target\" (or, more precisely\
    \ in the terminology of this document given\n   in Section 3 and 5.4 below, the\
    \ \"Rule Maker\").\n   The ability to gather and generate a Target's location,\
    \ and access to\n   the derived or computed location, are key elements of the\
    \ location-\n   based services privacy equation.  Central to a Target's privacy\
    \ are\n   (a) the identity of entities that have access to raw location data,\n\
    \   derive or compute location, and/or have access to derived or computed\n  \
    \ location information, and (b) whether those entities can be trusted\n   to know\
    \ and follow the Privacy Rules of the user.\n   The main principles guiding the\
    \ requirements described in this\n   document are:\n   1) Security of the transmission\
    \ of Location Object is essential to\n      guarantee the integrity and confidentiality\
    \ of the location\n      information.  This includes authenticating the sender\
    \ and receiver\n      of the Location Object, and securing the Location Object\
    \ itself.\n   2) A critical role is played by user-controlled Privacy Rules, which\n\
    \      describe the restrictions imposed or permissions given by the\n      \"\
    user\" (or, as defined below, the \"Rule Maker\").  The Privacy\n      Rules specify\
    \ the necessary conditions that allow a Location\n      Server to forward Location\
    \ Information to a Location Recipient,\n      and the conditions and purposes\
    \ for which the Location Information\n      can be used.\n   3) One type of Privacy\
    \ Rules specify how location information should\n      be filtered, depending\
    \ on who the recipient is.  Filtering is the\n      process of reducing the precision\
    \ or resolution of the data.  A\n      typical rule may be of the form: \"my location\
    \ can only be\n      disclosed to the owner of such credentials in such precision\
    \ or\n      resolution\" (e.g., \"my co-workers can be told the city I am\n  \
    \    currently in\").\n   4) The Location Object should be able to carry a limited\
    \ but core set\n      of Privacy Rules.  The exact form or expressiveness of those\
    \ Rules\n      in the core set or in the full set is not further discussed in\n\
    \      this document, but will be discussed more extensively in future\n     \
    \ documents produced by this working group.\n   5) Whenever appropriate, the location\
    \ information should not be\n      linked to the real identity of the user or\
    \ a static identifier\n      easily linked back to the real identity of the user\
    \ (i.e.,\n      Personally Identifiable Information such as a name, mailing\n\
    \      address, phone number, social security number, or email address or\n  \
    \    username).  Rather, the user should be able to specify which local\n    \
    \  identifier, unlinked pseudonym, or private identifier is to be\n      bound\
    \ to the location information.\n   6) The user may want to hide the real identities\
    \ of himself and his\n      partners, not only to eavesdroppers but also to other\
    \ entities\n      participating in the protocol.\n   Although complete anonymity\
    \ may not be appropriate for some\n   applications because of legal constraints\
    \ or because some location\n   services may in fact need explicit identifications,\
    \ most often the\n   location services only need some type of authorization information\n\
    \   and/or perhaps anonymous identifiers of the entities in question.\n"
- title: 2.  Conventions Used in this Document
  contents:
  - "2.  Conventions Used in this Document\n   The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\"\
    , \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\"\
    ,  \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n   document are to be interpreted as described\
    \ in [RFC2119].\n   Note that the requirements discussed here are requirements\
    \ on the\n   generic Location Object and on using protocols for location services.\n\
    \   Thus, for the most part, the requirements discussed in this document\n   refer\
    \ to capabilities that are mandatory-to-implement.  For example,\n   requiring\
    \ that implementations support integrity is not the same\n   thing as requiring\
    \ that all protocol traffic be authenticated.  In\n   contrast, an example of\
    \ a mandatory-to-use (not just mandatory-to-\n   implement) requirement might\
    \ be one that states that the user always\n   receives a notice when his location\
    \ data was not authenticated.  This\n   practice is mandatory-to-use, not just\
    \ to implement.\n"
- title: 3.  Glossary
  contents:
  - "3.  Glossary\n   For easy reference and readability, below are basic terms that\
    \ will\n   be defined more formally and fully later in this document.\n      Location\
    \ Generator (LG): The entity that initially determines or\n         gathers the\
    \ location of the Target and creates Location Objects\n         describing the\
    \ location of the Target.\n      Location Object (LO): An object conveying location\
    \ information\n         (and possibly privacy rules) to which Geopriv security\n\
    \         mechanisms and privacy rules are to be applied.\n      Location Recipient\
    \ (LR): The entity that receives location\n         information.  It may have\
    \ asked for this location explicitly\n         (by sending a query to a location\
    \ server), or it may receive\n         this location asynchronously.\n      Location\
    \ Server (LS): The entity to which a LG publishes location\n         objects,\
    \ the recipient of queries from location receivers, and\n         the entity that\
    \ applies rules designed by the rule maker.\n      Precision: The number of significant\
    \ digits to which a value has\n         been reliably measured.\n      Principal:\
    \ The holder/subject of the credentials, e.g., a\n         workstation user or\
    \ a network server.\n      Resolution: The fineness of detail that can be distinguished\
    \ in a\n         measured area.  Applied to Geopriv this means the finite area\n\
    \         within provided and closed borders (ex. Latitude and Longitude\n   \
    \      boundaries).\n      Rule Holder: The entity that provides the rules associated\
    \ with a\n         particular target for the distribution of location information.\n\
    \         It may either 'push' rules to a location server, or a location\n   \
    \      server may 'pull' rules from the Rule Holder.\n      Rule Maker: The authority\
    \ that creates rules governing access to\n         location information for a\
    \ target (typically, this it the\n         target themselves).\n      Rule, or\
    \ Privacy Rule: A directive that regulates an entity's\n         activities with\
    \ respect to location information, including the\n         collection, use, disclosure,\
    \ and retention of location\n         information.\n      Target: A person or\
    \ other entity whose location is communicated by\n         a Geopriv Location\
    \ Object.\n      Using Protocol: A protocol that carries a Location Object.\n\
    \      Viewer: A Principal that consumes location information that is\n      \
    \   communicated by a Geopriv Location Object, but does not pass\n         this\
    \ information further.\n   Resolution and Precision are very close terms.  Either\
    \ quality can be\n   'reduced' to coarsen location information: 'resolution' by\
    \ defining a\n   off-center perimeter around a user's location or otherwise enlarging\n\
    \   the area in consideration (from state to country, say) and\n   'precision'\
    \ by discarding significant digits of positioning\n   information (rounding off\
    \ longitude and latitude from seconds to\n   minutes, say).  Another WG document\
    \ discusses this topic in much more\n   detail.\n"

    \         +----------+\n   The four primary Entities are described as follows:\n\
    \      Location Generator (LG):  The entity that initially determines or\n   \
    \      gathers the location of the Target and creates Location Objects\n     \
    \    describing that location.  LGs publish Location Objects to\n         Location\
    \ Servers.  The manner in which the Location Generator\n         learns of Location\
    \ Information is outside the scope of the\n         Geopriv Protocol.\n      Location\
    \ Server (LS): The LS is an element that receives\n         publications of Location\
    \ Objects from Location Generators and\n         may receive subscriptions from\
    \ Location Recipients.  The LS\n         applies the rules (which it learns from\
    \ the Rule Holder) to LOs\n         it receives from LGs, and then notifies LRs\
    \ of resulting LOs as\n         necessary.\n      Location Recipient (LR): The\
    \ LR is an element that receives\n         notifications of Location Objects from\
    \ Location Servers.  The\n         LR may render these LOs to a user or automaton\
    \ in some fashion.\n      Rule Holder (RH): The RH is an element that houses Privacy\
    \ Rules\n         for receiving, filtering and distributing Location Objects for\n\
    \         specific Targets.  An LS may query an RH for a set of rules, or\n  \
    \       rules may be pushed from the RH to an LS.  The rules in the\n        \
    \ Rule Holder are populated by the Rule Maker.\n   Thus Location Generation is\
    \ the process of gathering Location\n   Information, perhaps from multiple sources,\
    \ at an IP-based Geopriv\n   Entity, the LG, which communicates with other Geopriv\
    \ Entities.\n   Rules MUST be authenticated and protected.  How this is done and\
    \ in\n   particular how to distribute the keys to the RM and other authorities\n\
    \   is outside of the scope of this document.  See also Section 8.2,\n   \"Securing\
    \ the Privacy Rules\".\n   The interfaces between the Geopriv entities are not\
    \ necessarily\n   protocol interfaces; they could be internal interfaces within\
    \ a\n   single composed device.  In some architectures, the Location\n   Generator,\
    \ Rule Holder, and Location Server might all be implemented\n   in the same device.\
    \  There may be several Rule Holders that enforce\n   the Privacy Rules at a particular\
    \ Location Server.\n"

- title: 5.1.  Location Information and Sighting
  contents:
  - "5.1.  Location Information and Sighting\n   The focus of the Geopriv working\
    \ group is on information about a\n   Target's location that is NOT based on generally\
    \ or publicly\n   available sources, but instead on private information provided\
    \ or\n   created by a Target, a Target's Device, or a Target's network or\n  \
    \ service provider.  Notwithstanding this focus on private location\n   information,\
    \ the Geopriv Location Object could certainly be used to\n   convey location information\
    \ from publicly available sources.\n      Location Information: A relatively specific\
    \ way of describing\n         where a Device is located.\n   This Location Information\
    \ may have been determined in many different\n   ways, including:\n   (a) derived\
    \ or computed from information generally not available to\n   the general public\
    \ (such as information mainly available to a network\n   or service provider),\
    \ (b) determined by a Device that may not be\n   generally publicly addressable\
    \ or accessible, or (c) input or\n   otherwise provided by a Target.\n   As examples,\
    \ the Location Information could include (a) information\n   calculated by triangulating\
    \ on a wireless signal with respect to cell\n   phone towers, (b) longitude and\
    \ latitude information determined by a\n   Device with GPS (global positioning\
    \ satellite) capabilities, (c)\n   information manually entered into a cell phone\
    \ or laptop by a Target\n   in response to a query, or (d) automatically delivered\
    \ by some other\n   IP protocol, such as at device configuration via DHCP.\n \
    \  Excluded from this definition is the determination of location\n   information\
    \ wholly without the knowledge or consent of the Target (or\n   the Target's network\
    \ or access service provider), based on generally\n   available information such\
    \ as an IP or e-mail address.  In some\n   cases, information like IP address\
    \ can enable someone to estimate (at\n   least roughly) a location.  Commercial\
    \ services exist that provide\n   rough location information based on IP addresses.\
    \  Currently, this\n   type of location information is typically less precise\
    \ than the type\n   of location information addressed in this document.  Although\
    \ this\n   type of location computation still raises significant potential\n \
    \  privacy and public privacy concerns, such scenarios are generally\n   outside\
    \ the scope of this document.\n   Within any given location-based transaction,\
    \ the INITIAL\n   determination of location (and thus the initial creation of\
    \ Location\n   Information) is termed a Sighting:\n      Sighting:\n         The\
    \ initial determination of location based on non-public\n         information\
    \ (as discussed in the definition of Location\n         Information), and the\
    \ initial creation of Location Information.\n   Some variant of the sighting information\
    \ is included in the Location\n   Object.  Abstractly, it consists of two separate\
    \ data fields:\n            (Identifier, Location)\n   where Identifier is the\
    \ identifier assigned to a Target being\n   sighted, and Location is the current\
    \ position of that Target being\n   sighted.  Not all entities may have access\
    \ to exactly the same piece\n   of sighting information.  A sighting may be transformed\
    \ to a new\n   sighting pair:\n            (Identifier-1, Location-1)\n   before\
    \ it is provided by a Location Generator or Location Server to\n   Location Recipient.\
    \  In this case, Identifier-1 may be a Pseudonym,\n   and Location-1 may have\
    \ less precision or resolution than the\n   original value.\n"
- title: 5.2.  The Location Object and Using Protocol
  contents:
  - "5.2.  The Location Object and Using Protocol\n   A main goal of the Geopriv working\
    \ group is to define a Location\n   Object (LO), to be used to convey both Location\
    \ Information and basic\n   privacy-protecting instructions:\n      Location Object\
    \ (LO): This data contains the Location Information\n         of the Target, and\
    \ other fields including an identity or\n         pseudonym of the Target, time\
    \ information, core Privacy Rules,\n         authenticators, etc.  Most of the\
    \ fields are optional,\n         including the Location Information itself.\n\
    \   Nothing is said about the semantics of a missing field.  For\n   instance,\
    \ a partially filled object MAY be understood implicitly as a\n   request to complete\
    \ it.  Or, if no time information is included, this\n   MAY implicitly mean \"\
    at the current time\" or \"at a very recent time\",\n   but it could be interpreted\
    \ in a different way, depending on the\n   context.\n   The \"using protocol\"\
    \ is the protocol that uses (reads or modifies)\n   the Location Object.  A protocol\
    \ that just transports the LO as a\n   string of bits, without looking at them\
    \ (like an IP storage protocol\n   could do), is not a using protocol, but only\
    \ a transport protocol.\n   Nevertheless, the entity or protocol that caused the\
    \ transport\n   protocol to move the LO is responsible for the appropriate\n \
    \  distribution, protection, usage, retention, and storage of the LO\n   based\
    \ on the rules that apply to that LO.\n   The security and privacy enhancing mechanisms\
    \ used to protect the LO\n   are of two types: First, the Location Object definition\
    \ MUST include\n   the fields or mechanisms used to secure the LO as such.  The\
    \ LO MAY\n   be secured, for example, using cryptographic checksums or encryption\n\
    \   as part of the LO itself.  Second, the using protocol may also\n   provide\
    \ security mechanisms to securely transport the Location\n   Object.\n   When\
    \ defining the LO, the design should observe that the security\n   mechanisms\
    \ of the Location Object itself are to be preferred.  Thus\n   the definition\
    \ of the LO MUST include some minimal crypto\n   functionality (Req. 14 and 15).\
    \  Moreover, if the RM specifies the\n   use of a particular LO security mechanism,\
    \ it MUST be used (Req. 4).\n"

    \ technical device whereby the location is tracked as a proxy\n         for the\
    \ location of a Target.\n   A Device might, for example, be a cell phone, a Global\
    \ Positioning\n   Satellite (GPS) receiver, a laptop equipped with a wireless\
    \ access\n   Device, or a transmitter that emits a signal that can be tracked\
    \ or\n   located.  In some situations, such as when a Target manually inputs\n\

    \ be placed on the Privacy Rules of the Rule\n         Maker:\n         1. In\
    \ the case of emergency services (such as E911 within the\n            United\

    \       2. In the case of legal interception, the RM may not be aware\n      \
    \      of an override directive imposed by a legal authority.  It\n          \

    \ be a\n         wireless carrier, an Internet Service Provider, or an internal\n\

  - "5.5.  Privacy Rules\n   Privacy Rules are rules that regulate an entity's activities\
    \ with\n   respect to location and other information, including, but not limited\n\
    \   to, the collection, use, disclosure, and retention of location\n   information.\
    \  Such rules are generally based on fair information\n   practices, as detailed\
    \ in (for example) the OECD Guidelines on the\n   Protection of Privacy and Transporter\
    \ Flows of Personal Data [OECD].\n      Privacy Rule:\n         A rule or set\
    \ of rules that regulate an entity's activities\n         with respect to location\
    \ information, including the collection,\n         use, disclosure, and retention\
    \ of location information.  In\n         particular, the Rule describes how location\
    \ information may be\n         used by an entity and which transformed location\
    \ information\n         may be released to which entities under which conditions.\n\
    \         Rules must be obeyed; they are not advisory.\n   A full set of Privacy\
    \ Rules will likely include both rules that have\n   only one possible technical\
    \ meaning, and rules that will be affected\n   by a locality's prevailing laws\
    \ and customs.  For example, a\n   distribution rule of the form \"my location\
    \ can only be disclosed to\n   the owner of such credentials and in such precision\
    \ or resolution\"\n   has clear-cut implications for the protocol that uses the\
    \ LO.  But\n   other rules, like retention or usage Rules, may have unclear\n\
    \   technical consequences for the protocol or for the involved entities.\n  \
    \ For example, the precise scope of a retention rule stating \"you may\n   not\
    \ store my location for more than 2 days\" may in part turn on local\n   laws\
    \ or customs.\n"

  contents:
  - "5.6.  Identifiers, Authentication and Authorization\n   Anonymity is the property\
    \ of being not identifiable (within a set of\n   subjects).  Anonymity serves\
    \ as the base case for privacy: without\n   the ability to remain anonymous, individuals\
    \ may be unable to control\n   their own privacy.  Unlinkability ensures that\
    \ a user may make\n   multiple uses of resources or services without others being\
    \ able to\n   link these uses to each other.  Unlinkability requires that entities\n\
    \   be unable to determine whether the same user caused certain specific\n   operations\
    \ in the system. [ISO99]  A pseudonym is simply a bit string\n   which is unique\
    \ as an ID and is suitable to be used for end-point\n   authentication.\n    \
    \  Unlinked Pseudonym:\n         A pseudonym where the linking between the pseudonym\
    \ and its\n         holder is, at least initially, not known to anybody with the\n\
    \         possible exception of the holder himself or a trusted server of\n  \

    \ Pseudonym).\n   The word authentication is used in different manners.  Some\
    \ require\n   that authentication associates an entity with a more or less well-\n\
    \   known identity.  This basically means that if A authenticates another\n  \
    \ entity B as being \"id-B\", then the label \"id-B\" is a well-known, or\n  \
    \ at least a linkable identity of the entity.  In this case, the label\n   \"\
    id-B\" is called a publicly known identifier, and the authentication\n   is \"\
    explicit\":\n      Explicit Authentication:\n         The act of verifying a claimed\
    \ identity as the sole originator\n         of a message (message authentication)\
    \ or as the end-point of a\n         channel (entity authentication).  Moreover,\

    \ in\n         question, for instance being a pre-existing static label from a\n\
    \         predefined name space (telephone number, name, etc.)\n      Authorization:\n\

    \ +----------+\n   Assume that the Rule Maker and the Target are registered with\
    \ the\n   Location Server.  The RM has somehow proven to the LS that he indeed\n\
    \   is the owner of the privacy rights of the Target (the Target is\n   usually\
    \ a Device owned by the Rule Maker).  The Rule Maker and the\n   Location Server\
    \ have agreed on the set of keys or credentials and\n   cryptographic material\
    \ that they will use to authenticate each other,\n   and in particular, to authenticate\
    \ or sign the Rules.  How this has\n   been done is outside of the scope of the\
    \ document.\n      1: Rule Transfer:\n         The Rule Maker sends a Rule to\
    \ the Location Server.  This Rule\n         may or may not be a field in a Location\
    \ Object.\n      1a:Signed Rule:\n         As an alternative, the Rule Maker may\
    \ write a Rule and place it\n         in a Public Rule Holder.  The entities access\
    \ the repository to\n         read the signed Rules.\n      2: Location Information\
    \ Request:\n         The Location Recipient requests location information for\
    \ a\n         Target.  In this request, the Location Recipient may select\n  \
    \       which location information data type it prefers.  One way of\n       \
    \  requesting Location Information MAY be sending a partially\n         filled\
    \ Location Object, including only the identities of the\n         Target and Location\
    \ Recipient and the desired Data Type and\n         precision or resolution, and\
    \ providing proof of possession of\n         the required credentials.  But whether\
    \ or not the using\n         protocol understands this partially filled object\
    \ as a request\n         MAY depend on the using protocol or on the context. \
    \ The\n         Location Recipient could also specify the need for periodic\n\
    \         location information updates, but this is probably out of the\n    \
    \     scope of Geopriv.\n      3: Locate:\n         When a Location Server receives\
    \ a Location Information Request\n         for a Target which has no current location\
    \ information, the\n         server may ask the Location Generator to locate the\
    \ Target.\n      4: Location Information:\n         The Location Generator sends\
    \ the \"full\" location information to\n         the Location Server.  This Location\
    \ Information may or may not\n         be embedded in a Location Object.\n   \
    \   5: Filtered Location Information:\n         The Location Server sends the\
    \ location information to the\n         Location Recipient.  The information may\
    \ be filtered in the\n         sense that in general a less precise or a computed\
    \ version of\n         the information is being delivered.\n"

    \ requirements on\n   the definition of the LO.  Some Requirements read like this:\
    \  \"The LO\n   definition MUST contain Field 'A' as an optional field.\"  This\n\
    \   requirement states that\n   o  the document that defines the LO MUST define\
    \ the LO field 'A',\n   o  the field 'A' MUST be defined as optional to use (an\
    \ instance of a\n      LO MAY or may not contain the field 'A').\n   Some Requirements\
    \ read like this: \"The LO definition MUST contain\n   Field 'A', which MAY be\
    \ an optional field.\"  This requirement states\n   that\n   o  the document that\
    \ defines the LO MUST define the LO field 'A',\n   o  the field 'A' MAY be defined\
    \ as optional or not to use.  If it is\n      defined as optional to use, any\
    \ instance of an LO MAY or may not\n      contain the field 'A'; if it is not\
    \ optional, all instances of LOs\n      MUST contain the field 'A'.\n   Req. 1.\
    \  (Location Object generalities)\n      1.1) Geopriv MUST define one Location\
    \ Object (LO) -- both in\n      syntax and semantics -- that must be supported\
    \ by all Geopriv\n      entities.\n      1.2) Some fields of the Location Object\
    \ MAY be optional.  This\n      means that an instance of a Location Object MAY\
    \ or may not contain\n      the fields.\n      1.3) Some fields of the Location\
    \ Object MAY be defined as\n      \"extensions\".  This means that the syntax\
    \ or semantics of these\n      fields is not fully defined in the basic Location\
    \ Object\n      definition, but their use may be private to one or more of the\n\
    \      using protocols.\n      1.4) The Location Object MUST be extensible, allowing\
    \ the\n      definition of new attributes or fields.\n      1.5) The object MUST\
    \ be suitable for requesting and receiving a\n      location.\n      1.6) The\
    \ object MUST permit (but not require) the Privacy Rules to\n      be enforced\
    \ by a third party.\n      1.7) The object MUST be usable in a variety of protocols,\
    \ such as\n      HTTP and SIP, as well as local APIs.\n      1.8) The object MUST\
    \ be usable in a secure manner even by\n      applications on constrained devices.\n\

    \    contain the following Fields, which MAY be optional to use:\n      2.1) Target\
    \ Identifier\n      2.2) Location Recipient Identity\n      This identity may\
    \ be a multicast or group identity, used to\n      include the Location Object\
    \ in multicast-based using protocols.\n      2.3) Location Recipient Credential\n\
    \      2.4) Location Recipient Proof-of-Possession of the Credential\n      2.5)\
    \ Location Field\n      2.5.1) Motion and direction vectors.  This field MUST\
    \ be optional.\n      2.6) Location Data Type\n      When transmitting the Location\
    \ Object, the sender and the receiver\n      must agree on the data type of the\
    \ location information.  The\n      using protocol may specify that the data type\
    \ information is part\n      of the Location Object or that the sender and receiver\
    \ have agreed\n      on it before the actual data transfer.\n      2.7) Timing\
    \ information:\n      (a) When was the Location Information accurate? (sighting\
    \ time)\n      (b) Until when considered current?  TTL (Time-to-live) (This is\n\
    \      different than a privacy rule setting a limit on data retention)\n    \
    \  2.8) Rule Field: this field MAY be a referral to an applicable\n      Rule\
    \ (for instance, a URI to a full Rule), or it MAY contain a\n      Limited Rule\
    \ (see Req. 11), or both.\n      2.9) Security-headers and -trailers (for instance\
    \ encryption\n      information, hashes, or signatures) (see Req. 14 and 15).\n\
    \      2.10) Version number\n   Req. 3.  (Location Data Types)\n      3.1) The\
    \ Location Object MUST define at least one Location Data\n      Type to be supported\
    \ by all Geopriv receivers (entities that\n      receive LOs).\n      3.2) The\
    \ Location Object SHOULD define two Location Data Types:\n      one for latitude\
    \ / longitude / altitude coordinates and one for\n      civil locations (City,\
    \ Street, Number) supported by all Geopriv\n      receivers (entities that receive\
    \ LOs).\n      3.3) The latitude / longitude / altitude Data Type SHOULD also\n\
    \      support a delta format in addition to an absolute one, used for\n     \
    \ the purpose of reducing the size of the packages or the security\n      and\
    \ confidentiality needs.\n      3.4) The Location Object definition SHOULD agree\
    \ on further\n      Location Data Types supported by some Geopriv entities and\
    \ defined\n      by other organizations.\n"

    \ the choice of writing a Rule that says:\n   -  \"If the emergency server does\

    \   -  \"If the emergency server does not authenticate itself, let the\n     \
    \ call fail\".\n   Second, in the case where the authentication of the emergency\
    \ call\n   fails because the user may not authenticate itself, the question\n\
    \   arises: whose Rule to use?  It is reasonable to use a default one:\n   this\
    \ location information can only be sent to an emergency center.\n   The third\
    \ situation, which should be studied in more detail, is:\n   what to do if not\
    \ only the user fails to authenticate itself, but\n   also the emergency center\

    \ anyway, but are there any security\n   threats that must be considered?\n"
- title: 8.4.  Identities and Anonymity
  contents:
  - "8.4.  Identities and Anonymity\n   The use of Unlinked Pseudonyms is necessary\
    \ to obtain anonymity.\n   The purpose of the use of Unlinked Pseudonyms is the\
    \ following: the\n   using protocol should be able to hide the real identity of\
    \ the Rule\n   Maker, the Target, and the Device, from Location Servers or Location\n\
    \   Recipients, if required by the RM.  Also, the using protocol SHOULD\n   be\
    \ able to hide the real identity of the Location Recipient from the\n   Location\
    \ Server.\n   In this last case, the Target is not concerned about the Server\n\
    \   identifying him and knowing his location, but identifying his\n   business\
    \ partners, and therefore his habits, etc.  Reasons for hiding\n   the real identities\
    \ of the Location Recipients include (a) that this\n   knowledge may be used to\
    \ infer the identity of the Target, (b) that\n   knowledge of the identity of\
    \ the Location Recipient may embarrass the\n   Target or breach confidential information,\
    \ and (c) that the dossier\n   telling who has obtained a Target's location information\
    \ over a long\n   period of time can give information on habits, movements, etc.\
    \  Even\n   if the location service providers agree to respect the privacy of\
    \ the\n   user, are compelled by laws or regulations to protect the privacy of\n\
    \   the user, and misbehavior or negligence of the Location Server can be\n  \
    \ ruled out, there is still risk that personal data may become\n   available to\
    \ unauthorized persons through attacks from outsiders,\n   unauthorized access\
    \ from insiders, technical or human errors, or\n   legal processes.\n   On some\
    \ occasions, a Location Server has to know who is supplying the\n   Privacy Rules\
    \ for a particular Target, while in other situations it\n   could be enough to\
    \ know that the supplier of the Rules is authorized\n   to do so.\n"

  contents:
  - "9.1.  Multiple Locations in one LO\n   A location Field is intended to represent\

    \ possibility of\n   inclusion of multiple locations is discussed in another document.\n\
    \   The current rough consensus is the following: the LO definition MAY\n   allow\
    \ the Location Field to be optional, to appear exactly one time\n   or to occur\
    \ several times.  Each Location Field may contain one or\n   more \"Location Representations\"\
    , each of which is intended to\n   represent a different measurement or a different\
    \ formatting of the\n   same position.  But there are other possibilities for\

    \   formats, or multiple sightings at different times, or multiple sensor\n  \
    \ locations for the same device, or other purposes, which could also\n   depend\
    \ on the using protocol.  This is all for further discussion.\n"
- title: 9.2.  Translation Fields
  contents:
  - "9.2.  Translation Fields\n   It is possible to include fields to indicate that\
    \ one of the\n   locations is a translation of another.  If this is done, it is\
    \ also\n   possible to have a field to identify the translator, as identity and\n\
    \   method.\n"

  contents:
  - "9.3.  Truth Flag\n   Geopriv MUST be silent on the truth or lack-of-truth of\
    \ the location\n   information contained in the LO.  Thus, the LO MUST NOT provide\
    \ an\n   attribute in object saying \"I am (or am not) telling you the whole\n\
    \   truth.\"\n"

- title: 9.5.  The Name Space of Identifiers
  contents:
  - "9.5.  The Name Space of Identifiers\n   Who defines the Identities: can the using\
    \ protocol define the\n   Identifiers or must the using protocol use and authenticate\n\
    \   Pseudonyms proposed by the Rules, chosen independently of the using\n   protocol?\
    \  Of course, if the using protocol has an appropriate\n   namespace, containing\
    \ many unused names that may be used as\n   pseudonyms and may be replaced by\
    \ new ones regularly, then the\n   Location Object may be able to use the name\
    \ space.  For this purpose,\n   the user would probably have to write his Rules\
    \ using this name\n   space.  Note that it is necessary to change the used pseudonyms\n\
    \   regularly, because identifying the user behind an unlinked pseudonym\n   can\
    \ be very simple.\n   There are several advantages in letting the using protocol\
    \ define the\n   name space:\n   o  the embedded authentication would be easier,\
    \ as the using protocol\n      often already has the credentials for the authentication\
    \ identity\n      in place and the \"embedded\" authentication would be independent\
    \ on\n      the form of Identifiers,\n   o  the size of the names would be fixed.\n\
    \   On the other hand, the benefits of the Rule choosing the identifiers\n   are:\n\
    \   o  the user has a control of his anonymity, and\n   o  the interworking of\
    \ multiple systems with Location object across\n      protocol boundaries is facilitated.\n"
