    \ can\n   assist in meeting the Operations and Management (OAM) requirements\n\
    \   outlined in [RFC4377] and [Y1710] and can apply to the management\n   functions\

    \ known as FCAPS) for MPLS networks, as defined in\n   [RFC3031].  The approach\
    \ of the document is to outline functionality,\n   the potential mechanisms to\
    \ provide the function, and the required\n   applicability of data plane OAM functions.\
    \  Included in the\n   discussion are security issues specific to use of tools\

    \ data plane\n   failures between the ingress and egress of an LSP.  This section\

    \   might not) detect the situation.\n"
- title: 3.1.1.  Enumeration and Detection of Types of Data Plane Faults
  contents:
  - "3.1.1.  Enumeration and Detection of Types of Data Plane Faults\n   Lower-layer\
    \ faults:\n      Lower-layer faults are those in the physical or virtual link\
    \ that\n      impact the transport of MPLS labeled packets between adjacent LSRs\n\
    \      at the specific level of interest.  Some physical links (such as\n    \
    \  SONET/SDH) may have link-layer OAM functionality and detect and\n      notify\
    \ the LSR of link-layer faults directly.  Some physical links\n      (such as\
    \ Ethernet) may not have this capability and require MPLS\n      or IP layer heartbeats\
    \ to detect failures.  However, once\n      detected, reaction to these fault\
    \ notifications is often the same\n      as those described in the first case.\n\
    \   Node failures:\n      Node failures are those that impact the forwarding capability\
    \ of a\n      node component, including its entire set of links.  This can be\n\
    \      due to component failure, power outage, or reset of the control\n     \
    \ processor in an LSR employing a distributed architecture, etc.\n   MPLS LSP\
    \ mis-forwarding:\n      Mis-forwarding occurs when there is a loss of synchronization\n\
    \      between the data and the control planes in one or more nodes.\n      This\
    \ can occur due to hardware failure, software failure, or\n      configuration\
    \ problems.\n      It will manifest itself in one of two forms:\n      -  packets\
    \ belonging to a particular LSP are cross-connected into\n         an NHLFE for\
    \ which there is no corresponding ILM at the next\n         downstream LSR.  This\
    \ can occur in cases where the NHLFE entry\n         is corrupted.  Therefore,\
    \ the packet arrives at the next LSR\n         with a top label value for which\
    \ the LSR has no corresponding\n         forwarding information, and is typically\
    \ dropped.  This is a No\n         Incoming Label Map (No ILM) condition and can\
    \ be detected\n         directly by the downstream LSR that receives the incorrectly\n\
    \         labeled packet.\n      -  packets belonging to a particular LSP are\
    \ cross-connected into\n         an incorrect NHLFE entry for which there is a\
    \ corresponding ILM\n         at the next downstream LSR, but is associated with\
    \ a different\n         LSP.  This may be detected by the following:\n       \
    \  o  some or all of the misdirected traffic is not routable at\n            the\
    \ egress node, or\n         o  OAM probing is able to detect the fault by detecting\
    \ the\n            inconsistency between the data path and the control plane\n\
    \            state.\n   Discontinuities in the MPLS Encapsulation\n      The forwarding\
    \ path of the FEC carried by an LSP may transit nodes\n      or links for which\
    \ MPLS is not configured.  This may result in a\n      number of behaviors that\
    \ are undesirable and not easily detected.\n      -  if exposed, payload is not\
    \ routable at the LSR, resulting in\n         silent discard, OR\n      -  the\
    \ exposed MPLS label was not offered by the LSR, which may\n         result in\
    \ either silent discard or mis-forwarding.\n      Alternately, the payload may\
    \ be routable and packets successfully\n      delivered but may bypass associated\
    \ MPLS instrumentation and\n      tools.\n   MTU problems\n      MTU problems\
    \ occur when client traffic cannot be fragmented by\n      intermediate LSRs and\
    \ is dropped somewhere along the path of the\n      LSP.  MTU problems should\
    \ appear as a discrepancy in the traffic\n      count between the set of ingress\
    \ LSRs and the egress LSRs for an\n      FEC and will appear in the corresponding\
    \ MPLS MIB performance\n      tables in the transit LSRs as discarded packets.\n\
    \   TTL Mishandling\n      The implementation of TTL handling is inconsistent\
    \ at penultimate\n      hop LSRs.  Tools that rely on consistent TTL processing\
    \ may\n      produce inconsistent results in any given network.\n   Congestion\n\
    \      Congestion occurs when the offered load on any interface exceeds\n    \
    \  the link capacity for sufficient time that the interface buffering\n      is\
    \ exhausted.  Congestion problems will appear as a discrepancy in\n      the traffic\
    \ count between the set of ingress LSRs and the egress\n      LSRs for an FEC\
    \ and will appear in the MPLS MIB performance tables\n      in the transit LSRs\
    \ as discarded packets.\n   Mis-ordering\n      Mis-ordering of LSP traffic occurs\
    \ when incorrect or inappropriate\n      load sharing is implemented within an\
    \ MPLS network.  Load sharing\n      typically takes place when multiple equal-cost\
    \ paths exist between\n      the ingress and egress of an LSP.  In these cases,\
    \ traffic is\n      split among these equal-cost paths using a variety of algorithms.\n\
    \      One such algorithm relies on splitting traffic between each path\n    \
    \  on a per-packet basis.  When this is done, it is possible for some\n      packets\
    \ along the path to be delayed due to congestion or slower\n      links, which\
    \ may result in packets being received out of order at\n      the egress.  Detection\
    \ and remedy of this situation may be left up\n      to client applications that\
    \ use the LSPs.  For instance, TCP is\n      capable of re-ordering packets belonging\
    \ to a specific flow\n      (although this may result in re-transmission of some\
    \ of the mis-\n      ordered packets).\n      Detection of mis-ordering can also\
    \ be determined by sending probe\n      traffic along the path and verifying that\
    \ all probe traffic is\n      indeed received in the order it was transmitted.\
    \  This will only\n      detect truly pathological problems as mis-ordering typically\
    \ is an\n      insufficiently predictable and repeatable problem.\n      LSRs\
    \ do not normally implement mechanisms to detect mis-ordering\n      of flows.\n\
    \   Payload Corruption\n      Payload corruption may occur and may be undetected\
    \ by LSRs.  Such\n      errors are typically detected by client payload integrity\n\
    \      mechanisms.\n"

- title: 3.2.2.  Isolation
  contents:
  - "3.2.2.  Isolation\n   Isolation of a fault can occur in two forms.  In the first\
    \ case, the\n   local failure is detected, and the node where the failure occurred\
    \ is\n   capable of issuing an alarm for such an event.  The node should\n   attempt\
    \ to withdraw the defective resources and/or rectify the\n   situation prior to\
    \ raising an alarm.  Active data plane OAM\n   mechanisms may also detect the\
    \ failure conditions remotely and issue\n   their own alarms if the situation\
    \ is not rectified quickly enough.\n   In the second case, the fault has not been\
    \ detected locally.  In this\n   case, the local node cannot raise an alarm, nor\
    \ can it be expected to\n   rectify the situation.  In this case, the failure\
    \ may be detected\n   remotely via data plane OAM.  This mechanism should also\
    \ be able to\n   determine the location of the fault, perhaps on the basis of\
    \ limited\n   information such as a customer complaint.  This mechanism may also\
    \ be\n   able to automatically remove the defective resources from the network\n\
    \   and restore service, but should at least provide a network operator\n   with\
    \ enough information by which they can perform this operation.\n   Given that\
    \ detection of faults is desired to happen as quickly as\n   possible, tools which\
    \ possess the ability to incrementally test LSP\n   health should be used to uncover\

    \   used).  As such, more than one model may be defined and more than one\n  \
    \ measurement technique may be required.\n"

  - "4.  Configuration Management\n   Data plane OAM can assist in configuration management\
    \ by providing\n   the ability to verify the configuration of an LSP or of applications\n\
    \   utilizing that LSP.  This would be an ad-hoc data plane probe that\n   should\
    \ verify path integrity (a complete path exists) and that the\n   path function\
    \ is synchronized with the control plane.  As part of the\n   payload, the probe\

- title: 6.  Performance Management
  contents:
  - "6.  Performance Management\n   Performance management permits the information\
    \ transfer\n   characteristics of LSPs to be measured, perhaps in order to be\n\
    \   compared against an SLA.  This falls into two categories: latency\n   (where\
    \ jitter is considered a variation in latency) and information\n   loss.\n   Latency\
    \ can be measured in two ways: one is to have precisely\n   synchronized clocks\
    \ at the ingress and egress such that time-stamps\n   in PDUs flowing from the\
    \ ingress to the egress can be compared.  The\n   other is to use an exchange\
    \ of PING type PDUs that gives a round trip\n   time (RTT) measurement, and an\
    \ estimate of the one-way latency that\n   can be inferred with some loss of precision.\
    \  Use of load spreading\n   techniques, such as ECMP, mean that any individual\
    \ RTT measurement is\n   only representative of the typical RTT for an FEC.\n\
    \   To measure information loss, a common practice is to periodically\n   read\
    \ ingress and egress counters (i.e., MIB module counters).  This\n   information\
    \ may also be used for offline correlation.  Another common\n   practice is to\
    \ send explicit probe traffic that traverses the data\n   plane path in question.\
    \  This probe traffic can also be used to\n   measure jitter and delay.\n"
- title: 7.  Security Management
  contents:
  - "7.  Security Management\n   Providing a secure OAM environment is required if\
    \ MPLS specific\n   network mechanisms are to be used successfully.  To this end,\n\
    \   operators have a number of options when deploying network mechanisms\n   including\
    \ simply filtering OAM messages at the edge of the MPLS\n   network.  Malicious\
    \ users should not be able to use non-MPLS\n   interfaces to insert MPLS-specific\
    \ OAM transactions.  Provider\n   initiated OAM transactions should be able to\
    \ be blocked from leaking\n   outside the MPLS cloud.\n   Finally, if a provider\
    \ does wish to allow OAM messages to flow into\n   (or through) their networks,\
    \ for example, in a multi-provider\n   deployment, authentication and authorization\
    \ are required to prevent\n   malicious and/or unauthorized access.  Also, given\
    \ that MPLS networks\n   often run IP simultaneously, similar requirements apply\
    \ to any native\n   IP OAM network mechanisms in use.  Therefore, authentication\
    \ and\n   authorization for OAM technologies is something that MUST be\n   considered\
    \ when designing network mechanisms that satisfy the\n   framework presented in\
    \ this document.\n   OAM messaging can address some existing security concerns\
    \ with the\n   MPLS architecture.  That is, through rigorous defect handling,\n\
    \   operator's can offer their customers a greater degree of integrity\n   protection\
    \ that their traffic will not be incorrectly delivered (for\n   example, by being\
    \ able to detect leaking LSP traffic from a VPN).\n   Support for inter-provider\
    \ data plane OAM messaging introduces a\n   number of security concerns as, by\
    \ definition, portions of LSPs will\n   not be within a single provider's network\
    \ the provider has no control\n   over who may inject traffic into the LSP, which\
    \ can be exploited for\n   denial of service attacks.  OAM PDUs are not explicitly\
    \ identified in\n   the MPLS header and therefore are not typically inspected\
    \ by transit\n   LSRs.  This creates opportunity for malicious or poorly behaved\
    \ users\n   to disrupt network operations.\n   Attempts to introduce filtering\
    \ on target LSP OAM flows may be\n   problematic if flows are not visible to intermediate\
    \ LSRs.  However,\n   it may be possible to interdict flows on the return path\
    \ between\n   providers (as faithfulness to the forwarding path is to a return\
    \ path\n   requirement) to mitigate aspects of this vulnerability.\n   OAM tools\
    \ may permit unauthorized or malicious users to extract\n   significant amounts\
    \ of information about network configuration.  This\n   would be especially true\
    \ of IP based tools as, in many network\n   configurations, MPLS does not typically\
    \ extend to untrusted hosts,\n   but IP does.  For example, TTL hiding at ingress\
    \ and egress LSRs will\n   prevent external users from using TTL-based mechanisms\
    \ to probe an\n   operator's network.  This suggests that tools used for problem\n\
    \   diagnosis or which, by design, are capable of extracting significant\n   amounts\
    \ of information will require authentication and authorization\n   of the originator.\
    \  This may impact the scalability of such tools\n   when employed for monitoring\
    \ instead of diagnosis.\n"
