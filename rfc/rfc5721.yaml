  - "1.  Introduction\n   This document forms part of the Email Address Internationalization\n\
    \   (EAI) experiment described in the EAI Framework document [RFC4952]\n   (for\
    \ background, please see the charter of the EAI working group) and\n   should\
    \ be evaluated within the context of EAI.  As part of the\n   overall EAI work,\
    \ email messages may be transmitted and delivered\n   containing un-encoded UTF-8\
    \ characters, and mail drops that are\n   accessed using POP3 [RFC1939] might\
    \ natively store UTF-8.\n   This specification extends POP3 [RFC1939] using the\
    \ POP3 extension\n   mechanism [RFC2449] to permit un-encoded UTF-8 [RFC3629]\
    \ in headers,\n   as described in \"Internationalized Email Headers\" [RFC5335].\
    \  It also\n   adds a mechanism to support login names and passwords outside the\n\
    \   ASCII character set, and a mechanism to support UTF-8 protocol-level\n   error\
    \ strings in a language appropriate for the user.\n   This document updates POP3\
    \ [RFC1939], and the fact that an\n   Experimental specification updates a Standards\
    \ Track specification\n   means that people who participate in the experiment\
    \ have to consider\n   the Standard updated.  In an attempt to reduce confusion,\
    \ this\n   Experimental document does not contain an \"Updates\" header.  If and\n\
    \   when a version of this document moves to the Standards Track, an\n   \"Updates:\
    \ 1939\" header should be added.\n   Within this specification, the term \"down-conversion\"\
    \ refers to the\n   process of modifying a message containing UTF8 headers [RFC5335]\
    \ or\n   body parts with 8bit content-transfer-encoding, as defined in MIME\n\
    \   Section 2.8 [RFC2045], into conforming 7-bit Internet Message Format\n   [RFC5322]\
    \ with message header extensions for non-ASCII text [RFC2047]\n   and other 7-bit\
    \ encodings.  Down-conversion is specified by\n   \"Downgrading Mechanism for\
    \ Email Address Internationalization\"\n   [RFC5504].\n"

- title: 2.  LANG Capability
  contents:
  - "2.  LANG Capability\n   Per \"POP3 Extension Mechanism\" [RFC2449], this document\
    \ adds a new\n   capability response tag to indicate support for a new command:\
    \ LANG.\n   The capability tag and new command are described below.\n   CAPA tag:\n\
    \      LANG\n   Arguments with CAPA tag:\n      none\n   Added Commands:\n   \
    \   LANG\n   Standard commands affected:\n      All\n   Announced states / possible\
    \ differences:\n      both / no\n   Commands valid in states:\n      AUTHENTICATION,\
    \ TRANSACTION\n   Specification reference:\n      this document\n   Discussion:\n\
    \   POP3 allows most +OK and -ERR server responses to include human-\n   readable\
    \ text that, in some cases, might be presented to the user.\n   But that text\
    \ is limited to ASCII by the POP3 specification\n   [RFC1939].  The LANG capability\
    \ and command permit a POP3 client to\n   negotiate which language the server\
    \ should use when sending human-\n   readable text.\n   A server that advertises\
    \ the LANG extension MUST use the language\n   \"i-default\" as described in [RFC2277]\
    \ as its default language until\n   another supported language is negotiated by\
    \ the client.  A server\n   MUST include \"i-default\" as one of its supported\
    \ languages.\n   The LANG command requests that human-readable text included in\
    \ all\n   subsequent +OK and -ERR responses be localized to a language matching\n\
    \   the language range argument (the \"Basic Language Range\" as described\n \
    \  by [RFC4647]).  If the command succeeds, the server returns a +OK\n   response\
    \ followed by a single space, the exact language tag selected,\n   another space,\
    \ and the rest of the line is human-readable text in the\n   appropriate language.\
    \  This and subsequent protocol-level human-\n   readable text is encoded in the\
    \ UTF-8 charset.\n   If the command fails, the server returns an -ERR response\
    \ and\n   subsequent human-readable response text continues to use the language\n\
    \   that was previously active (typically i-default).\n   The special \"*\" language\
    \ range argument indicates a request to use a\n   language designated as preferred\
    \ by the server administrator.  The\n   preferred language MAY vary based on the\
    \ currently active user.\n   If no argument is given and the POP3 server issues\
    \ a positive\n   response, then the response given is multi-line.  After the initial\n\
    \   +OK, for each language tag the server supports, the POP3 server\n   responds\
    \ with a line for that language.  This line is called a\n   \"language listing\"\
    .\n   In order to simplify parsing, all POP3 servers are required to use a\n \
    \  certain format for language listings.  A language listing consists of\n   the\
    \ language tag [RFC5646] of the message, optionally followed by a\n   single space\
    \ and a human-readable description of the language in the\n   language itself,\
    \ using the UTF-8 charset.\n   Examples:\n      < Note that some examples do not\
    \ include the correct character\n      accents due to limitations of this document\
    \ format. >\n      < The server defaults to using English i-default responses\
    \ until\n      the client explicitly changes the language. >\n      C: USER karen\n\

  - "3.  UTF8 Capability\n   Per \"POP3 Extension Mechanism\" [RFC2449], this document\
    \ adds a new\n   capability response tag to indicate support for new server\n\

    \   This capability adds the \"UTF8\" command to POP3.  The UTF8 command\n   switches\
    \ the session from ASCII to UTF-8 mode.\n"
- title: 3.1.  The UTF8 Command
  contents:
  - "3.1.  The UTF8 Command\n   The UTF8 command enables UTF-8 mode.  The UTF8 command\
    \ has no\n   parameters.\n   Maildrops can natively store UTF-8 or be limited\
    \ to ASCII.  UTF-8\n   mode has no effect on messages in an ASCII-only maildrop.\
    \  Messages\n   in native UTF-8 maildrops can be ASCII or UTF-8 using\n   internationalized\
    \ headers [RFC5335] and/or 8bit content-transfer-\n   encoding, as defined in\
    \ MIME Section 2.8 [RFC2045].  In UTF-8 mode,\n   both UTF-8 and ASCII messages\
    \ are sent to the client as-is (without\n   conversion).  When not in UTF-8 mode,\
    \ UTF-8 messages in a native\n   UTF-8 maildrop MUST be down-converted (downgraded)\
    \ to comply with\n   unextended POP and Internet Mail Format.  POP servers (unlike\
    \ SMTP\n   and Submit servers) are not required to use \"Downgrading Mechanism\n\
    \   for Email Address Internationalization\" [RFC5504].\n   Discussion: The main\
    \ argument against a single required mechanism for\n   downgrading by a POP server\
    \ is that the only clients that have any\n   use for a standardized downgraded\
    \ message (because they wish to\n   interpret downgrade headers, for example)\
    \ are ones that can support\n   UTF-8 and, hence, will issue the UTF8 command\
    \ in the first place.\n   The counter argument to this is that clients that do\
    \ not support\n   UTF-8 might be upgraded in the future; it's desirable for an\
    \ upgraded\n   client to be capable of interpreting prior downgraded messages\
    \ in the\n   local mail store, which is most likely if the messages were\n   downgraded\
    \ using one standardized procedure.\n   Therefore, while POP servers are not required\
    \ to use \"Downgrading\n   Mechanism for Email Address Internationalization\"\
    \ [RFC5504], there\n   are advantages to them doing so.\n   Note that even in\
    \ UTF-8 mode, MIME binary content-transfer-encoding\n   is still not permitted.\n\
    \   The octet count (size) of a message reported in a response to the\n   LIST\
    \ command SHOULD match the actual number of octets sent in a RETR\n   response\
    \ (not counting byte-stuffing).  Sizes reported elsewhere,\n   such as in STAT\
    \ responses and non-standardized, free-form text in\n   positive status indicators\
    \ (following \"+OK\") need not be accurate,\n   but it is preferable if they are.\n\
    \   Discussion: Mail stores are either ASCII or native UTF-8, and clients\n  \
    \ either issue the UTF8 command or not.  The message needs converting\n   only\
    \ when it is native UTF-8 and the client has not issued the UTF-8\n   command,\
    \ in which case the server must down-convert it.  The down-\n   converted message\
    \ may be larger.  The server may choose various\n   strategies regarding down-conversion,\
    \ which include when to down-\n   convert, whether to cache or store the down-converted\
    \ form of a\n   message (and if so, for how long), and whether to calculate or\
    \ retain\n   the size of a down-converted message independently of the down-\n\
    \   converted content.  If the server does not have immediate access to\n   the\
    \ accurate down-converted size, it may be faster to estimate rather\n   than calculate\
    \ it.  Servers are expected to normally follow the RFC\n   1939 [RFC1939] text\
    \ on using the \"exact size\" in a scan listing, but\n   there may be situations\
    \ with maildrops containing very large numbers\n   of messages in which this might\
    \ be a problem.  If the server does\n   estimate, reporting a scan listing size\
    \ smaller than what it turns\n   out to be could be a problem for some clients.\
    \  In summary, it is\n   better for servers to report accurate sizes, but if this\
    \ is not\n   possible, high guesses are better than small ones.  Some POP servers\n\
    \   include the message size in the non-standardized text response\n   following\
    \ \"+OK\" (the 'text' production of RFC 2449 [RFC2449]), in a\n   RETR or TOP\
    \ response (possibly because some examples in POP3\n   [RFC1939] do so).  There\
    \ has been at least one known case of a client\n   relying on this to know when\
    \ it had received all of the message\n   rather than following the POP3 [RFC1939]\
    \ rule of looking for a line\n   consisting of a termination octet (\".\") and\
    \ a CRLF pair.  While any\n   such client is non-compliant, if a server does include\
    \ the size in\n   such text, it is better if it is accurate.\n   Clients MUST\
    \ NOT issue the STLS command [RFC2595] after issuing UTF8;\n   servers MAY (but\
    \ are not required to) enforce this by rejecting with\n   an \"-ERR\" response\
    \ an STLS command issued subsequent to a successful\n   UTF8 command.  (Because\
    \ this is a protocol error as opposed to a\n   failure based on conditions, an\
    \ extended response code [RFC2449] is\n   not specified.)\n"
- title: 3.2.  USER Argument to UTF8 Capability
  contents:
  - "3.2.  USER Argument to UTF8 Capability\n   If the USER argument is included with\
    \ this capability, it indicates\n   that the server accepts UTF-8 user names and\
    \ passwords.\n   Servers that include the USER argument in the UTF8 capability\n\
    \   response SHOULD apply SASLprep [RFC4013] to the arguments of the USER\n  \
    \ and PASS commands.\n   A client or server that supports APOP and permits UTF-8\
    \ in user names\n   or passwords MUST apply SASLprep [RFC4013] to the user name\
    \ and\n   password used to compute the APOP digest.\n   When applying SASLprep\
    \ [RFC4013], servers MUST reject UTF-8 user\n   names or passwords that contain\
    \ a Unicode character listed in Section\n   2.3 of SASLprep [RFC4013].  When applying\
    \ SASLprep to the USER\n   argument, the PASS argument, or the APOP username argument,\
    \ a\n   compliant server or client MUST treat them as a query string (i.e.,\n\
    \   unassigned Unicode codepoints are allowed).  When applying SASLprep\n   to\
    \ the APOP password argument, a compliant server or client MUST\n   treat them\
    \ as a stored string (i.e., unassigned Unicode codepoints\n   are prohibited).\n\
    \   The client does not need to issue the UTF8 command prior to using\n   UTF-8\
    \ in authentication.  However, clients MUST NOT use UTF-8 in\n   USER, PASS, or\
    \ APOP commands unless the USER argument is included in\n   the UTF8 capability\
    \ response.\n   The server MUST reject UTF-8 user names or passwords that fail\
    \ to\n   comply with the formal syntax in UTF-8 [RFC3629].\n   Use of UTF-8 in\
    \ the AUTH command is governed by the POP3 SASL\n   [RFC5034] mechanism.\n"

  contents:
  - "4.  Native UTF-8 Maildrops\n   When a POP3 server uses a native UTF-8 maildrop,\
    \ it is the\n   responsibility of the server to comply with the POP3 base\n  \
    \ specification [RFC1939] and Internet Message Format [RFC5322] when\n   not in\

  contents:
  - "6.  Security Considerations\n   The security considerations of UTF-8 [RFC3629]\
    \ and SASLprep [RFC4013]\n   apply to this specification, particularly with respect\
    \ to use of\n   UTF-8 in user names and passwords.\n   The \"LANG *\" command\
    \ might reveal the existence and preferred\n   language of a user to an active\
    \ attacker probing the system if the\n   active language changes in response to\
    \ the USER, PASS, or APOP\n   commands prior to validating the user's credentials.\
    \  Servers MUST\n   implement a configuration to prevent this exposure.\n   It\
    \ is possible for a man-in-the-middle attacker to insert a LANG\n   command in\
    \ the command stream, thus making protocol-level diagnostic\n   responses unintelligible\
    \ to the user.  A mechanism to integrity-\n   protect the session, such as Transport\
    \ Layer Security (TLS) [RFC2595]\n   can be used to defeat such attacks.\n   Modifying\
    \ server authentication code (in this case, to support UTF-8)\n   needs to be\
    \ done with care to avoid introducing vulnerabilities (for\n   example, in string\
    \ parsing).\n   The UTF8 command description (Section 3.1) contains a discussion\
    \ on\n   reporting inaccurate sizes.  An additional risk to doing so is that,\n\
    \   if a client allocates buffers based on the reported size, it may\n   overrun\
    \ the buffer, crash, or have other problems if the message data\n   is larger\
    \ than reported.\n"

- title: Appendix A.  Design Rationale
  contents:
  - "Appendix A.  Design Rationale\n   This non-normative section discusses the reasons\
    \ behind some of the\n   design choices in the above specification.\n   Having\
    \ servers perform up-conversion so that, at a minimum, RFC2047-\n   encoded words\
    \ are decoded into UTF-8 is tempting, since this is an\n   area that clients often\
    \ fail to correctly implement.  However, after\n   much discussion, the EAI group\
    \ felt that the benefits did not justify\n   the burden.\n   Due to interoperability\
    \ problems with RFC 2047 and limited deployment\n   of RFC 2231, it is hoped these\
    \ 7-bit encoding mechanisms can be\n   deprecated in the future when UTF-8 header\
    \ support becomes prevalent.\n   USER is optional because the implementation burden\
    \ of SASLprep\n   [RFC4013] is not well understood, and mandating such support\
    \ in all\n   cases could negatively impact deployment.\n   While it is possible\
    \ to provide useful examples for language\n   negotiation without support for\
    \ non-ASCII characters, it is difficult\n   to provide useful examples for commands\
    \ specifically designed to use\n   the UTF-8 charset un-encoded when the document\
    \ format is limited to\n   ASCII.  As a result, there are no plans to provide\
    \ examples for that\n   part of the specification as long as this remains an experimental\n\
    \   proposal.  However, implementers of this specification are encouraged\n  \
    \ to provide examples to the document authors for a future revision.\n   While\
    \ down-conversion of native UTF-8 messages is mandatory in the\n   absence of\
    \ the UTF8 command, servers are not required to use\n   \"Downgrading Mechanism\
    \ for Email Address Internationalization\"\n   [RFC5504] to do so.  As clients\
    \ are upgraded with UTF-8 support and\n   the ability to intelligently handle\
    \ (e.g., display and reply to)\n   UTF-8 messages that were downgraded in transit,\
    \ it is better if they\n   are also able to handle messages in the local mail\
    \ store that were\n   downgraded by the POP server.  This is more likely if the\
    \ POP server\n   downgrades messages using the same mechanism as an SMTP server.\n"
