  - "Abstract\n   This document extends the Personal Assertion Token (PASSporT), which\n
    \  is a token object that conveys cryptographically signed information\n   about
    the participants involved in communications.  The extension is\n   defined based
    on the \"Signature-based Handling of Asserted\n   information using toKENs (SHAKEN)\"
    specification by the ATIS/SIP\n   Forum IP-NNI Task Group.  It provides both (1)
    a specific set of\n   levels of confidence in the correctness of the originating
    identity\n   of a call originated in a SIP-based telephone network as well as
    (2)\n   an identifier that allows the Service Provider (SP) to uniquely\n   identify
    the origin of the call within its network.\n"

  - "1.  Introduction\n   The Signature-based Handling of Asserted information using
    toKENs\n   (SHAKEN) [ATIS-1000074] specification defines a framework for using\n
    \  Secure Telephone Identity Revisited (STIR) protocols including the\n   Personal
    Assertion Token (PASSporT) [RFC8225], SIP Authenticated\n   Identity Management
    [RFC8224], and the STIR certificate framework\n   [RFC8226] for implementing the
    cryptographic validation of an\n   authorized originator of telephone calls using
    SIP.  Because the\n   current telephone network contains traffic originated from
    both VoIP\n   and TDM/SS7 (Time Division Multiplexing / Signaling System 7), there\n
    \  are many scenarios that need to be accounted for where PASSporT\n   signatures
    may represent either direct or indirect call origination\n   scenarios.  The SHAKEN
    [ATIS-1000074] specification defines levels of\n   attestation of the origination
    of the call as well as an origination\n   identifier that can help create a unique
    association between the\n   origin of a particular call to the point in the VoIP
    or TDM telephone\n   network the call came from to identify, for example, either
    a\n   customer or class of service that call represents.  This document\n   specifies
    these values as claims to extend the base set of PASSporT\n   claims.\n"

    \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"NOT RECOMMENDED\",
    \"MAY\", and\n   \"OPTIONAL\" in this document are to be interpreted as described
    in\n   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all\n   capitals,
    as shown here.\n   In addition, the following terms are used in this document:\n
    \  o  Verified association: Typically defined as an authenticated\n      relationship
    between a customer and a device that initiated a call\n      on behalf of that
    customer, for example, a subscriber account with\n      a specific SIM card or
    set of SIP credentials.\n   o  PASSporT: Defined in [RFC8225] is a JSON Web Token
    [RFC7519]\n      defined specifically for securing the identity of an initiator
    of\n      personal communication.  This document defines a specific\n      extension
    to PASSporT.\n"
  title: 2.  Terminology

  - "3.  Overview of \"shaken\" PASSporT Extension\n   The SHAKEN framework is designed
    to use PASSporT [RFC8225] as a\n   method of asserting the caller's telephone
    identity.  In addition to\n   the PASSporT base claims, there are two additional
    claims that have\n   been defined for the needs of a service provider to signal\n
    \  information beyond just the telephone identity.  First, in order to\n   help
    bridge the transition of the state of the current telephone\n   network (which
    has calls with no authentication and non-SIP [RFC3261]\n   signaling not compatible
    with the use of PASSporT and Secure\n   Telephone Identity (STI) in general),
    there is an attestation claim.\n   This provides three levels of attestation:
    a full attestation when\n   the service provider can fully attest to the calling
    identity, a\n   partial attestation when the service provider originated a telephone\n
    \  call but cannot fully attest to the calling identity, and a gateway\n   attestation,
    which is the lowest level of attestation and represents\n   the service provider
    receiving a call from a telephone gateway that\n   does not support PASSporT or
    STI.\n   The second claim is a unique origination identifier that should be\n
    \  used by the service provider to identify different sources of\n   telephone
    calls to support a traceback mechanism that can be used for\n   enforcement and
    identification of a source of illegitimate calls.\n   The use of the compact form
    of PASSporT is not specified in this\n   document and is not specified for use
    in SHAKEN [ATIS-1000074].\n   The next two sections define these new claims.\n"

  - "4.  PASSporT \"attest\" Claim\n   This indicator allows for both identifying
    the service provider that\n   is vouching for the call as well as clearly indicating
    what\n   information the service provider is attesting to.  The \"attest\" claim\n
    \  can be one of the following three values: 'A', 'B', or 'C'.  These\n   values
    correspond to 'Full Attestation', 'Partial Attestation', and\n   'Gateway Attestation',
    respectively.  See [ATIS-1000074] for the\n   definitions of these three levels
    of attestation.\n"

    (UUID)\n   as defined in [RFC4122].  Please refer to Section 10 for a discussion\n

  - "9.  Security Considerations\n   This document defines a new PASSporT [RFC8225]
    extension.  The\n   considerations related to the security of the PASSporT object
    itself\n   are the same as those described in [RFC8225].\n   [RFC8224] defines
    how to compare the values of the \"dest\", \"orig\",\n   and \"iat\" claims against
    fields in a SIP message containing a\n   PASSporT as part of validating that request.
    \ The values of the new\n   \"attest\" and \"origid\" claims added by this extension
    are not used in\n   such a validation step.  They are not compared to fields in
    the SIP\n   message.  Instead, they simply carry additional information from the\n
    \  signer to the consumer of the PASSporT.  This new information shares\n   the
    same integrity protection and non-repudiation properties as the\n   base claims
    in the PASSporT.\n"
  title: 9.  Security Considerations
- contents:
  - "10.  Privacy Considerations\n   As detailed in Section 26 of [RFC3261], SIP messages
    inherently carry\n   identifying information of the caller and callee.  The addition
    of\n   STIR cryptographically attests that the signing party vouches for the\n
    \  information given about the callee, as is discussed in the Privacy\n   Considerations
    of [RFC8224].\n   SHAKEN [ATIS-1000074] furthermore adds an \"origid\" value to
    the STIR\n   PASSporT, which is an opaque unique identifier representing an\n
    \  element on the path of a given SIP request.  This identifier is\n   generated
    by an originating telephone service provider to identify\n   where within their
    network (e.g. a gateway or particular service\n   element) a call was initiated;
    \"origid\" can facilitate forensic\n   analysis of call origins when identifying
    and stopping bad actors\n   trying to spoof identities or make fraudulent calls.\n
    \  The opacity of the \"origid\" claim value is intended to minimize\n   exposure
    of information about the origination of calls labeled with\n   an \"origid\" value.
    \ It is therefore RECOMMENDED that implementations\n   generate a unique \"origid\"
    value per call in such a way that only the\n   generator of the \"origid\" can
    determine when two \"origid\" values\n   represent the same or different elements.
    \ If deployed systems\n   instead use a common or related \"origid\" for service
    elements in\n   their network, the potential for discovering patterns through\n
    \  correlation of those calls exists.  This could allow a recipient of\n   calls
    to, for instance, learn that a set of callers are using a\n   particular service
    or coming through a common gateway.  It is\n   expected that SHAKEN PASSporTs
    are shared only within an [RFC3324]\n   trust domain and will be stripped before
    calls exit that trust\n   domain, but this information still could be used by
    analytics on\n   intermediary and terminating systems to reveal information that
    could\n   include geographic location and even device-level information,\n   depending
    on how the \"origid\" is generated.\n"
