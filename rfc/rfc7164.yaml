  - "1.  Introduction\n   In some media networking applications, RTP streams are referenced
    to\n   a wall-clock time (absolute date and time).  This is accomplished\n   through
    use of the NTP timestamp field in the sender report (SR) to\n   create a mapping
    between RTP timestamps and the wall clock.  When a\n   wall-clock reference is
    used, the playout time for RTP packets is\n   referenced to the wall clock.  Smooth
    and continuous media playout\n   requires a smooth and continuous time base.  The
    time base used by\n   the wall clock may include leap seconds that are not rendered\n
    \  smoothly.\n   This document updates RFC 3550 [1] by providing recommendations
    for\n   smoothly rendering streamed media referenced to common wall clocks\n   that
    do not have smooth or continuous behavior in the presence of\n   leap seconds.\n"

  - "3.  Leap Seconds\n   The world's scientific time standard is International Atomic
    Time\n   (TAI), which is based on vibrations of cesium atoms in an atomic\n   clock.
    \ The world's civil time is based on the rotation of the Earth.\n   In 1972, the
    civil time standard, Coordinated Universal Time (UTC),\n   was redefined in terms
    of TAI and the concept of leap seconds was\n   introduced to allow UTC to remain
    synchronized with the rotation of\n   the Earth.\n   Leap seconds are scheduled
    by the International Earth Rotation and\n   Reference Systems Service.  Leap seconds
    may be scheduled at the last\n   day of any month but are preferentially scheduled
    for December and\n   June and secondarily March and September [6].  Because Earth's\n
    \  rotation is unpredictable, leap seconds are typically not scheduled\n   more
    than six months in advance.\n   Leap seconds do not respect local time and always
    occur at the end of\n   the UTC day.  Leap seconds can be scheduled to either
    add or remove a\n   second from the day.  A leap second that adds an extra second
    is\n   known as a positive leap second.  A leap second that skips a second\n   is
    known as a negative leap second.\n   Since their introduction in 1972, all leap
    seconds have been\n   scheduled in June or December, and they have all been positive.\n
    \  NOTE: The ITU is studying a proposal that could eventually eliminate\n   leap
    seconds from UTC.  As of January 2012, this proposal is expected\n   to be decided
    no earlier than 2015 [7].\n"
  - contents:
    - "3.1.  UTC Behavior during a Positive Leap Second\n   UTC clocks feature a 61st
      second at the end of the day when a\n   positive leap second is scheduled.  The
      leap second is designated\n   \"23h 59m 60s\".\n"
    title: 3.1.  UTC Behavior during a Positive Leap Second
  - contents:
    - "3.2.  NTP Behavior during a Positive Leap Second\n   Under NTP [8], a leap
      second is inserted at the beginning of the last\n   second of the day.  This
      results in the clock freezing or slowing for\n   one second immediately prior
      to the last second of the affected day.\n   This results in the last second
      of the day having a real-time\n   duration of two seconds.  Timestamp accuracy
      is compromised during\n   this period because the clock's rate is not well defined.\n"
    title: 3.2.  NTP Behavior during a Positive Leap Second
  - contents:
    - "3.3.  POSIX Behavior during a Positive Leap Second\n   The POSIX (Portable
      Operating System Interface) standard [3] requires\n   that leap seconds be omitted
      from reported time.  All days are\n   defined as having 86,400 seconds, but
      the timebase is defined to be\n   UTC, a leap-second-bearing reference.  Implementors
      of POSIX systems\n   are offered considerable latitude by the standard as to
      how to map\n   POSIX time to UTC.\n   In many systems, leap seconds are accommodated
      by repeating the last\n   second of the day.  A timestamp within the last second
      of the day is\n   therefore ambiguous in that it can refer to a moment in time
      in\n   either of the last two seconds of a day containing a leap second.\n   Other
      systems use the same technique used by NTP, freezing or slowing\n   for one
      second immediately prior to the last second of the affected\n   day.\n   In
      some cases, leap seconds are accommodated by warping time [5] [4];\n   that
      is, the length of the second in the vicinity of a leap second is\n   slightly
      altered.\n"

  - "4.  Receiver Behavior during a Leap Second\n   Timestamps generated during a
    leap second may be ambiguous or\n   interpreted differently by a sender and receiver
    or interpreted\n   differently by different receivers.\n   Without prior knowledge
    of the leap-second schedule, NTP servers and\n   clients may become offset by
    exactly one second with respect to their\n   UTC reference.  This potential discrepancy
    begins when a leap second\n   occurs and ends when all participants receive a
    time update from a\n   server or peer.  Depending on the system implementation,
    the offset\n   can last anywhere from a few seconds to a few days.  A long-lived\n
    \  discrepancy can be particularly disruptive to operation of NTP-\n   referenced
    RTP streams.\n   These discrepancies, depending on direction, may cause receivers
    to\n   think they are receiving RTP packets after they should be played or\n   to
    attempt to buffer received data an additional second before\n   playing it.  Either
    situation can cause an interruption in playback.\n   Some receivers may automatically
    recognize an unexpected offset and\n   resynchronize to the stream to accommodate
    it.  Once the offset is\n   resolved, such receivers may need to resynchronize
    again.\n"

  - "5.  Recommendations\n   Senders and receivers that are not referenced to a wall
    clock are not\n   affected by issues associated with leap seconds, and no special\n
    \  accommodation is required.\n   RTP implementation using a wall-clock reference
    is simplified by\n   using a clock with a timescale that does not include leap
    seconds.\n   IEEE 1588 [9], GPS [10], and other systems that use a TAI [11]\n
    \  reference do not include leap seconds.  NTP time, operating system\n   clocks,
    and other systems using a UTC reference include leap seconds.\n   Note that some
    TAI-based systems such as IEEE 1588 and GPS, in\n   addition to the TAI reference
    clock, deliver TAI to UTC mapping\n   information.  By combining the delivered
    TAI reference clock and the\n   mapping information, some receivers of these systems
    are able to\n   synthesize a leap-second-bearing UTC reference clock.  For the\n
    \  purposes of this document, it is important to recognize that it is\n   the
    timescale used, not the delivery mechanism that determines\n   whether a reference
    clock is leap-second bearing.\n     +-------------------------+---------------------+---------------+\n
    \    | Reference clock type    | Examples            | Accommodation |\n     +-------------------------+---------------------+---------------+\n

    \    | NTP                 | Recommended   |\n     +-------------------------+---------------------+---------------+\n
    \                    Table 2: Recommendations Summary\n   All participants generating
    or consuming timestamps associated with a\n   leap-second-bearing reference MUST
    recognize leap seconds and SHOULD\n   have a working communications channel to
    receive notifications of\n   leap-second scheduling.  A working communication
    channel includes a\n   protocol means of notifying clocks of an impending leap
    second such\n   as the Leap Indicator in the NTP header [8] and also a means for
    top-\n   tier clocks to receive leap-second schedule information published by\n
    \  the International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service [12].\n   Such
    a communications channel may not be available on all networks.\n   For security
    or other reasons, leap-second schedules may be\n   configured manually for some
    networks or clocks.  When a device does\n   not reliably receive leap-second scheduling
    information, failures as\n   described in Section 4 may occur.\n   Because of
    the timestamp ambiguity that positive leap seconds can\n   introduce and the inconsistent
    manner in which different systems\n   accommodate positive leap seconds, generating
    or using NTP timestamps\n   during the entire last second of a day on which a
    positive leap\n   second has been scheduled SHOULD be avoided.  Note that the
    period to\n   be avoided has a real-time duration of two seconds.  In the Table
    1\n   example, the region to be avoided is indicated by RTP timestamps\n   12000
    through 28000\n   Negative leap seconds do not introduce timestamp ambiguity or
    other\n   complications.  No special treatment is needed to avoid ambiguity\n
    \  with respect to RTP timestamps in the presence of a negative leap\n   second.\n
    \  POSIX clocks that use a warping technique to accommodate leap seconds\n   (e.g.,
    [4] [5]) are not a good choice for an interoperable timestamp\n   reference and
    SHOULD not be used to timestamp RTP streams.\n"

    - "5.1.  Sender Reports\n   In order to avoid generating or using NTP timestamps
      during positive\n   leap seconds, RTP senders and receivers need to avoid sending
      or\n   using sender reports to synchronize their clocks in the vicinity of a\n
      \  leap second and instead rely on their internal clocks to maintain\n   synchronization
      until the leap second has passed.\n   RTP Senders using a leap-second-bearing
      reference for timestamps\n   SHOULD NOT generate sender reports containing an
      originating NTP\n   timestamp in the vicinity of a positive leap second.  To
      maintain a\n   consistent RTCP schedule and avoid the risk of unintentional\n
      \  timeouts, such senders MAY send receiver reports in place of sender\n   reports
      in the vicinity of the leap second.\n   For the purpose of suspending sender
      reports in the vicinity of a\n   leap second, senders MAY assume that a positive
      leap second occurs at\n   the end of the last day of every month.\n   Receivers
      consuming leap-second-bearing timestamps SHOULD ignore\n   timestamps in any
      sender reports generated in the vicinity of a\n   positive leap second.\n   For
      the purpose of ignoring sender reports in the vicinity of a leap\n   second,
      receivers MAY assume that a positive leap second occurs at\n   the end of the
      last day of every month.\n"

- contents:
  - "6.  Security Considerations\n   RTP streams using a wall-clock reference as discussed
    here present an\n   additional attack vector compared to self-clocking streams.\n
    \  Manipulation of the wall clock at either the sender or receiver can\n   potentially
    disrupt streaming.\n   For an RTP stream operating to a leap-second-bearing reference
    to\n   operate reliably across a leap second, the sender and receiver must\n   both
    be aware of the leap second.  It is possible to disrupt a stream\n   by blocking
    or delaying leap second notification to one of the\n   participants.  Streaming
    can be similarly affected if one of the\n   participants can be tricked into believing
    a leap second has been\n   scheduled where there is not one.  These vulnerabilities
    are present\n   in RFC 3550 [1] and these new recommendations neither heighten
    nor\n   diminish them.  Integrity of the leap-second schedule is the\n   responsibility
    of the operating system and time distribution\n   mechanism, both of which are
    outside the scope of RFC 3550 [1] and\n   these recommendations.\n"
