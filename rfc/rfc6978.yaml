- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   This document describes an extension to the TCP Authentication\
    \ Option\n   (TCP-AO) [RFC5925] called TCP-AO-NAT to support its use in the\n\
    \   presence of Network Address Translators and/or Network Address and\n   Port\
    \ Translators (NATs/NAPTs) [RFC2663].  These devices translate the\n   source\
    \ address and/or the source port number of a TCP connection.\n   TCP-AO without\
    \ TCP-AO-NAT extensions would be sensitive to these\n   modifications and would\
    \ discard authenticated segments.\n   At least one potential application of TCP-AO-NAT\
    \ is to support the\n   experimental multipath TCP protocol [RFC6824], which uses\
    \ multiple IP\n   addresses to support a single TCP transfer.\n   This document\
    \ assumes detailed familiarity with TCP-AO [RFC5925].  As\n   a preview, this\
    \ document focuses on how TCP-AO generates traffic\n   keys, and it does not otherwise\
    \ alter the TCP-AO mechanism or that of\n   its key generation [RFC5926].\n"

- title: 3.  Background
  contents:
  - "3.  Background\n   TCP-AO generates traffic keys that are specific to a socket\
    \ pair\n   [RFC5925].  The following information is used to create a\n   connection's\
    \ traffic keys.  (Note that 'local' and 'remote' are\n   interpreted as in TCP-AO\
    \ [RFC5925].)\n   o  IP local address\n   o  IP remote address\n   o  TCP local\
    \ port\n   o  TCP remote port\n   o  TCP local Initial Sequence Number (ISN)\n\
    \   o  TCP remote Initial Sequence Number (ISN)\n   Of these fields, the remote\
    \ ISN is not known for SYN segments and is\n   excluded from the traffic key used\
    \ to authenticate them.  Otherwise,\n   all fields are used in the traffic keys\
    \ of all other segments.\n   NATs and NAPTs (both referred to herein as \"NATs\"\
    , even if port\n   translation is included) would interfere with these uses, because\n\
    \   they alter the IP address and TCP port of the endpoint behind the NAT\n  \
    \ [RFC2663].\n"
- title: 4.  Extension to Allow NAT Traversal
  contents:
  - "4.  Extension to Allow NAT Traversal\n   The premise of TCP-AO-NAT is that it\
    \ might be useful to allow TCP-AO\n   use in the presence of NATs, e.g., to protect\
    \ client/server\n   communication where clients are behind NATs.\n   This document\
    \ describes TCP-AO-NAT, an extension to TCP-AO that\n   enables its use in the\
    \ presence of NATs.  This extension requires no\n   modification to the TCP-AO\
    \ header or packet processing, and it\n   requires no modification to the algorithms\
    \ used to generate traffic\n   keys [RFC5926].  The change is limited to the data\
    \ used to generate\n   traffic keys only.\n   In TCP-AO, \"a Master Key Tuple\
    \ (MKT) describes the TCP-AO properties\n   to be associated with one or more\
    \ connections\" [RFC5925].  This\n   includes the TCP connection identifier, the\
    \ TCP option flag\n   (indicating whether TCP options other than TCP-AO are included\
    \ in the\n   Message Authentication Code (MAC) calculation), keying information,\n\
    \   and other parameters.  TCP-AO-NAT augments the MKT with two\n   additional\
    \ flags:\n   o  localNAT\n   o  remoteNAT\n   TCP-AO implementations supporting\
    \ TCP-AO-NAT MUST support both\n   localNAT and remoteNAT flags.\n   These flags\
    \ indicate whether a segment's local or remote\n   (respectively) IP address and\
    \ TCP port are zeroed before MAC\n   calculation, either for creating the MAC\
    \ to insert (for outgoing\n   segments) or for calculating a MAC to validate against\
    \ the value in\n   the option.  These flags modify TCP-AO processing rules as\
    \ follows:\n   o  In TCP-AO-NAT, traffic keys are computed by zeroing the\n  \
    \    local/remote IP address and TCP port as indicated by the localNAT\n     \
    \ or remoteNAT flags.\n   o  In TCP-AO-NAT, MAC values are computed by zeroing\
    \ the local/remote\n      IP address and TCP port as indicated by the localNAT\
    \ or remoteNAT\n      flags.\n   The use of these flags needs to match on both\
    \ ends of the connection,\n   just as with all other MKT parameters.\n"
- title: 5.  Intended Use
  contents:
  - "5.  Intended Use\n   A host MAY use TCP-AO-NAT when it is behind a NAT, as determined\n\
    \   using NAT discovery techniques, or when TCP-AO protection is desired\n   but\
    \ conventional TCP-AO fails to establish connections.\n   A client behind a NAT\
    \ MAY set localNAT=TRUE for MKTs supporting\n   TCP-AO-NAT for outgoing connections.\
    \  A server MAY set remoteNAT=TRUE\n   for MKTs supporting TCP-AO-NAT for incoming\
    \ connections.  Peer-to-\n   peer applications with dual NAT support, e.g., those\
    \ traversing\n   so-called 'symmetric NATs' [RFC5389], MAY set both localNAT=TRUE\
    \ and\n   remoteNAT=TRUE for MKTs supporting TCP-AO-NAT bidirectionally.  Once\n\
    \   these flags are set in an MKT, they affect all connections that match\n  \
    \ that MKT.\n   TCP-AO-NAT is intended for use only where coordinated between\n\
    \   endpoints for connections that match the shared MKT parameters, as\n   with\
    \ all other MKT parameters.\n   Note that TCP-AO-NAT is not intended for use with\
    \ services transiting\n   Application Layer Gateways (ALGs), i.e., NATs that also\
    \ translate\n   in-band addresses, such as used in FTP or SIP.  TCP-AO-NAT protects\n\
    \   the contents of the TCP segments from modification and would\n   (correctly)\
    \ interpret such alterations as an attack on those\n   contents.\n"
- title: 6.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "6.  Security Considerations\n   TCP-AO-NAT does not affect the security of connections\
    \ that do not\n   set either the localNAT or remoteNAT flags.  Such connections\
    \ are not\n   affected themselves and are not affected by segments in other\n\
    \   connections that set those flags.\n   Setting either the localNAT or remoteNAT\
    \ flags reduces the randomness\n   of the input to the Key Derivation Function\
    \ (KDF) used to generate\n   the traffic keys.  The largest impact occurs when\
    \ using IPv4, which\n   reduces the randomness from 2 IPv4 addresses, 2 ISNs,\
    \ and both ports\n   down to just the two ISNs when both flags are set.  The amount\
    \ of\n   randomness in the IPv4 addresses and service port is likely to be\n \
    \  small, and the randomness of the dynamic port is under debate and\n   should\
    \ not be considered substantial [RFC6056].  The KDF input\n   randomness is thus\
    \ expected to be dominated by that of the ISNs, so\n   reducing it by either or\
    \ both of the IPv4 addresses and ports is not\n   expected to have a significant\
    \ impact.\n"
