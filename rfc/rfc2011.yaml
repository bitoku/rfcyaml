    \ for the\n   Internet community, and requests discussion and suggestions for\n\
    \   improvements.  Please refer to the current edition of the \"Internet\n   Official\
    \ Protocol Standards\" (STD 1) for the standardization state\n   and status of\
    \ this protocol.  Distribution of this memo is unlimited.\n   The IP, UDP, and\
    \ TCP MIB modules currently support only IPv4.  These\n   three modules use the\
    \ IpAddress type defined as an OCTET STRING of\n   length 4 to represent the IPv4\
    \ 32-bit internet addresses.  (See RFC\n   1902, SMI for SNMPv2.)  They do not\
    \ support the new 128-bit IPv6\n   internet addresses.\n"

  - "1.  Introduction\n   A management system contains: several (potentially many)\
    \ nodes, each\n   with a processing entity, termed an agent, which has access\
    \ to\n   management instrumentation; at least one management station; and, a\n\
    \   management protocol, used to convey management information between\n   the\
    \ agents and management stations.  Operations of the protocol are\n   carried\
    \ out under an administrative framework which defines\n   authentication, authorization,\
    \ access control, and privacy policies.\n   Management stations execute management\
    \ applications which monitor and\n   control managed elements.  Managed elements\
    \ are devices such as\n   hosts, routers, terminal servers, etc., which are monitored\
    \ and\n   controlled via access to their management information.\n   Management\
    \ information is viewed as a collection of managed objects,\n   residing in a\
    \ virtual information store, termed the Management\n   Information Base (MIB).\
    \  Collections of related objects are defined\n   in MIB modules.  These modules\
    \ are written using a subset of OSI's\n   Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1)\
    \ [1], termed the Structure of\n   Management Information (SMI) [2].\n   This\
    \ document is the MIB module which defines managed objects for\n   managing implementations\
    \ of the Internet Protocol (IP) [3] and its\n   associated Internet Control Message\
    \ Protocol (ICMP) [4].\n   The managed objects in this MIB module were originally\
    \ defined using\n   the SNMPv1 framework as a part of MIB-II [5].  Since then,\
    \ the\n   managed objects related to managing routes in an IP internet were\n\
    \   updated by RFC 1354 [6].  This document takes the remaining MIB-II\n   objects\
    \ for these protocols, and defines them using the SNMPv2\n   framework.\n"
