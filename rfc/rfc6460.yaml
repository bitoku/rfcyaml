  - "1.  Introduction\n   This document specifies the conventions for using National\
    \ Security\n   Agency (NSA) Suite B Cryptography [SuiteB] with the Transport Layer\n\
    \   Security (TLS) protocol, and the Datagram Transport Layer Security\n   (DTLS)\
    \ protocol.\n   This document does not define any new cipher suites; instead,\
    \ it\n   defines a Suite B compliant profile for use with TLS version 1.2\n  \
    \ [RFC5246], DTLS version 1.2 [RFC6347], and the cipher suites defined\n   in\
    \ [RFC5289].  This profile uses only Suite B algorithms.\n   RFC 5430 defined\
    \ an additional transitional profile for use with TLS\n   versions 1.0 [RFC2246]\
    \ and 1.1 [RFC4346] or with DTLS version 1.0\n   [RFC4347] and the cipher suites\
    \ defined in [RFC4492].  When either\n   the client or the server does not support\
    \ TLS version 1.2 and DTLS\n   version 1.2, the transitional profile can be used\
    \ to achieve\n   interoperability that is not Suite B compliant.  The description\
    \ for\n   the transitional profile appears in Annex A of this document.\n"

  contents:
  - "3.1.  Minimum Levels of Security (minLOS) for Suite B TLS\n   Suite B provides\
    \ two levels of cryptographic security, namely a\n   128-bit minimum level of\
    \ security (minLOS_128) and a 192-bit minimum\n   level of security (minLOS_192).\
    \  Each level defines a minimum\n   strength that all cryptographic algorithms\
    \ must provide.\n   The following combination of algorithms and key sizes are\

    \ TLS client and a Suite B TLS server\n   establish a TLS version 1.2 session,\
    \ Suite B algorithms MUST be\n   employed.\n"
- title: 3.2 Suite B TLS Authentication
  contents:
  - "3.2 Suite B TLS Authentication\n   Suite B TLS MUST use ECDSA for digital signatures;\
    \ authentication\n   methods other than ECDSA-256 and ECDSA-384 MUST NOT be used\
    \ for TLS\n   authentication.  If a relying party receives a signature based on\
    \ any\n   other authentication method, it MUST return a TLS error and stop the\n\
    \   TLS handshake.\n   A system compliant with the Suite B TLS and configured\
    \ at a minimum\n   level of security of 128 bits MUST use either ECDSA-256 or\
    \ ECDSA-384\n   for client or server authentication.  One party can authenticate\
    \ with\n   ECDSA-256 when the other party authenticates with ECDSA-384.  This\n\
    \   flexibility allows interoperation between a client and a server that\n   have\
    \ ECDSA authentication keys of different sizes.\n   Clients and servers in a system\
    \ configured at a minimum level of\n   security of 128 bits MUST be able to verify\
    \ ECDSA-256 signatures and\n   SHOULD be able to verify ECDSA-384 signatures unless\
    \ it is absolutely\n   certain that the implementation will never need to verify\n\
    \   certificates originating from an authority that uses an ECDSA-384\n   signing\
    \ key.\n   A system compliant with the Suite B TLS and configured at a minimum\n\
    \   level of security of 192 bits MUST use ECDSA-384 for client and\n   server\
    \ authentication.\n   Clients and servers in a system configured at a minimum\
    \ level of\n   security of 192 bits MUST be able to verify ECDSA-384 signatures.\n\
    \   In all cases, the client MUST authenticate the server.  The server\n   MAY\
    \ authenticate the client, as needed by the specific application.\n"

  contents:
  - "4.  Suite B Compliance and Interoperability Requirements\n   TLS versions 1.1\
    \ [RFC4346] and earlier do not support Galois/ Counter\n   Mode (GCM) cipher suites\

    \ by the server\n   administrator.\n"
- title: 4.1.  Acceptable Curves
  contents:
  - "4.1.  Acceptable Curves\n   RFC 4492 defines a variety of elliptic curves.  Suite\
    \ B TLS\n   connections MUST use secp256r1(23) or secp384r1(24).  These are the\n\
    \   same curves that appear in FIPS 186-3 [DSS] as P-256 and P-384,\n   respectively.\
    \  Secp256r1 MUST be used for the key exchange in all\n   cipher suites in this\
    \ specification using AES-128; secp384r1 MUST be\n   used for the key exchange\
    \ in all cipher suites in this specification\n   using AES-256.  RFC 4492 requires\
    \ that the uncompressed(0) form be\n   supported.  The ansiX962_compressed_prime(1)\
    \ point format MAY also be\n   supported.\n   Clients desiring to negotiate only\
    \ a Suite B TLS connection MUST\n   generate a \"Supported Elliptic Curves Extension\"\
    \ containing only the\n   allowed curves.  Clients operating at a minimum level\
    \ of security of\n   128 bits MUST include secp256r1 and SHOULD include secp384r1\
    \ in the\n   extension.  Clients operating at a minimum level of security of 192\n\
    \   bits MUST include secp384r1 in the extension.  In order to be able to\n  \
    \ verify ECDSA signatures, a client and server in a system configured\n   at a\
    \ minimum level of security of 128 bits MUST support secp256r1 and\n   SHOULD\
    \ support secp384r1 unless it is absolutely certain that the\n   client and server\
    \ will never need to use or verify certificates\n   originating from an authority\
    \ which uses an ECDSA-384 signing key.  A\n   client and server in a system configured\
    \ at a minimum level of 192\n   bits MUST support secp384r1.\n   TLS connections\
    \ that offer options that are both compliant and non-\n   compliant with Suite\
    \ B MAY omit the extension, or they MAY send the\n   extension but offer other\
    \ curves as well as the appropriate Suite B\n   ones.\n   Servers desiring to\
    \ negotiate a Suite B TLS connection SHOULD check\n   for the presence of the\
    \ extension, but they MUST NOT select a curve\n   that is not Suite B even if\
    \ it is offered by the client.  This allows\n   a client that is willing to do\
    \ either Suite B or non-Suite B TLS\n   connections to interoperate with a server\
    \ that will only do Suite B\n   TLS.  If the client does not advertise an acceptable\
    \ curve, the\n   server MUST generate a fatal \"handshake_failure\" alert and\
    \ terminate\n   the connection.  Clients MUST check the chosen curve to make sure\n\

  contents:
  - "Annex A.  A Transitional Suite B Profile for TLS 1.1 and 1.0\n   A transitional\
    \ profile is described for use with TLS version 1.0\n   [RFC2246], TLS version\
    \ 1.1 [RFC4346], or DTLS version 1.0 [RFC4347]\n   and the cipher suites defined\
    \ in [RFC4492].  This profile uses the\n   Suite B cryptographic algorithms to\
    \ the greatest extent possible and\n   provides backward compatibility.  While\
    \ the transitional profile is\n   not a Suite B Compliant implementation of TLS,\
    \ it provides a\n   transitional path towards the Suite B compliant Profile.\n\
    \   The following combination of algorithms and key sizes are defined for\n  \
    \ use with the Suite B TLS transitional profile:\n   Transitional Suite B Combination\

    \ B Combination 2 in its entirety.\n   A Transitional Suite B TLS system configured\
    \ at a minimum level of\n   security of 192 bits MUST use a TLS cipher suite satisfying\n\

    \ level of\n   security of 128 bits, MUST offer the\n   TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA\
    \ cipher suite and/or the\n   TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA cipher suite\
    \ in the\n   ClientHello message.  The TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA cipher\n\
    \   suite is preferred; if it is offered, it MUST appear before the\n   TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA\
    \ cipher suite (if present).\n   A Transitional Suite B TLS system configured\
    \ at a minimum level of\n   security of 192 bits MUST offer the\n   TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA\
    \ cipher suite in the ClientHello\n   message.\n   One of these Transitional Suite\
    \ B cipher suites MUST be the first\n   (most preferred) in the ClientHello message.\n\
    \   A Transitional Suite B client that offers interoperability with\n   servers\
    \ that are not Suite B transitional MAY offer additional cipher\n   suites.  If\
    \ any additional cipher suites are offered, they MUST\n   appear after the Transitional\
    \ Suite B cipher suites in the\n   ClientHello message.\n   A Transitional Suite\
    \ B TLS server MUST implement TLS version 1.1 or\n   earlier.\n   A Transitional\
    \ Suite B TLS server configured at a minimum level of\n   security of 128 bits\
    \ MUST accept the\n   TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA cipher suite (preferred)\
    \ or the\n   TLS_ECHDE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA cipher suite if offered in the\n\
    \   ClientHello message.\n   A Transitional Suite B TLS server configured at a\
    \ minimum level of\n   security of 192 bits MUST accept the\n   TLS_ECHDE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA\
    \ cipher suite if offered in the\n   ClientHello message.\n   If a Transitional\
    \ Suite B TLS server is not offered the Transitional\n   Suite B cipher suites\
    \ and interoperability with non-Transitional\n   Suite B clients is desired, then\
    \ the server MAY accept another\n   offered cipher suite that is considered acceptable\
    \ by the server\n   administrator.\n   A Transitional Suite B TLS server MUST\
    \ sign the ServerKeyExchange\n   message using ECDSA with SHA-1.  The Transitional\
    \ Suite B profile\n   does not impose any additional restrictions on the server\
    \ certificate\n   signature or the signature schemes used elsewhere in the\n \
    \  certification path.  Likewise, the Transitional Suite B Profile does\n   not\
    \ impose restrictions on signature schemes used in the\n   certification path\
    \ for the client's certificate when mutual\n   authentication is employed.\n"
