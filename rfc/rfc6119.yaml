- title: 1.  Overview
  contents:
  - "1.  Overview\n   The IS-IS routing protocol is defined in [IS-IS].  Each router\n\
    \   generates a Link State PDU (LSP) that contains information describing\n  \
    \ the router and the links from the router.  The information in the LSP\n   is\
    \ encoded in a variable length data structure consisting of a Type,\n   Length,\
    \ and Value.  Such a data structure is referred to as a TLV.\n   [TE] and [GMPLS]\
    \ define a number of TLVs and sub-TLVs that allow\n   Traffic Engineering (TE)\
    \ information to be disseminated by the IS-IS\n   protocol [IS-IS].  The addressing\
    \ information passed in these TLVs is\n   IPv4 specific.\n   [IPv6] describes\
    \ how the IS-IS protocol can be used to carry out\n   Shortest Path First (SPF)\
    \ routing for IPv6.  It does this by defining\n   IPv6-specific TLVs that are\
    \ analogous to the TLVs used by IS-IS for\n   carrying IPv4 addressing information.\n\
    \   Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) traffic engineering is very\n   successful,\
    \ and, as the use of IPv6 grows, there is a need to be able\n   to support traffic\
    \ engineering in IPv6 networks.\n   This document defines the TLVs that allow\
    \ traffic engineering\n   information (including Generalized-MPLS (GMPLS) TE information)\
    \ to be\n   carried in IPv6 IS-IS networks.\n"

- title: 3.1.  Identifying IS-IS Links Using IPv6 Addresses
  contents:
  - "3.1.  Identifying IS-IS Links Using IPv6 Addresses\n   Each IS-IS link has certain\
    \ properties -- bandwidth, shared risk link\n   groups (SRLGs), switching capabilities,\
    \ and so on.  The IS-IS\n   extensions defined in [TE] and [GMPLS] describe how\
    \ to associate\n   these traffic engineering parameters with IS-IS links.  These\
    \ TLVs\n   use IPv4 addresses to identify the link (or local/remote link\n   identifiers\
    \ on unnumbered links).\n   When IPv6 is used, a numbered link may be identified\
    \ by IPv4 and/or\n   IPv6 interface addresses.  The type of identifier used does\
    \ not\n   affect the properties of the link; it still has the same bandwidth,\n\
    \   SRLGs, and switching capabilities.\n   This document describes an approach\
    \ for supporting IPv6 traffic\n   engineering by defining TLV extensions that\
    \ allow TE links and nodes\n   to be identified by IPv6 addresses.\n"
- title: 3.1.1.  IPv6 Address Types
  contents:
  - "3.1.1.  IPv6 Address Types\n   An IPv6 address can have global, unique-local,\
    \ or link-local scope.\n   -  A global IPv6 address is valid within the scope\
    \ of the Internet.\n   -  A unique-local IPv6 address is globally unique but is\
    \ intended for\n      local communication.\n   -  A link-local IPv6 address is\
    \ valid only within the scope of a\n      single link and may only be referenced\
    \ on that link.\n   Because the IPv6 traffic engineering TLVs present in LSPs\
    \ are\n   propagated across networks, they MUST NOT use link-local addresses.\n\
    \   IS-IS does not need to differentiate between global and unique-local\n   addresses.\n"
- title: 3.2.  IP Addresses Used in Traffic Engineering TLVs
  contents:
  - "3.2.  IP Addresses Used in Traffic Engineering TLVs\n   This section lists the\
    \ IP addresses used in the TLVs defined in [TE]\n   and [GMPLS] and gives an overview\
    \ of the required IPv6 equivalents.\n"
- title: 3.2.1.  TE Router ID TLV
  contents:
  - "3.2.1.  TE Router ID TLV\n   The TE Router ID TLV contains a stable IPv4 address\
    \ that is routable,\n   regardless of the state of each interface.\n   Similarly,\
    \ for IPv6, it is useful to have a stable IPv6 address\n   identifying a TE node.\
    \  The IPv6 TE Router ID TLV is defined in\n   Section 4.1.\n"
- title: 3.2.2.  IPv4 Interface Address Sub-TLV
  contents:
  - "3.2.2.  IPv4 Interface Address Sub-TLV\n   This sub-TLV of the Extended IS Reachability\
    \ TLV contains an IPv4\n   address for the local end of a link.  The equivalent\
    \ IPv6 Interface\n   Address sub-TLV is defined in Section 4.2.\n"
- title: 3.2.3.  IPv4 Neighbor Address Sub-TLV
  contents:
  - "3.2.3.  IPv4 Neighbor Address Sub-TLV\n   This sub-TLV of the Extended IS Reachability\
    \ TLV is used for point-\n   to-point links and contains an IPv4 address for the\
    \ neighbor's end of\n   a link.  The equivalent IPv6 Neighbor Address sub-TLV\
    \ is defined in\n   Section 4.3.\n   A router constructs the IPv4 Neighbor Address\
    \ sub-TLV using one of\n   the IPv4 addresses received in the IS-IS Hello (IIH)\
    \ PDU from the\n   neighbor on the link.\n   The IPv6 Neighbor Address sub-TLV\
    \ contains a globally unique IPv6\n   address for the interface from the peer\
    \ (which can be either a global\n   or unique-local IPv6 address).  The IPv6 Interface\
    \ Address TLV\n   defined in [IPv6] only contains link-local addresses when used\
    \ in the\n   IIH PDU.  Hence, a neighbor's IP address from the IPv6 Interface\n\
    \   Address TLV cannot be used when constructing the IPv6 Neighbor\n   Address\
    \ sub-TLV.  Instead, we define an additional TLV, the IPv6\n   Global Interface\
    \ Address TLV in Section 4.5.  The IPv6 Global\n   Interface Address TLV is included\
    \ in IIH PDUs to provide the globally\n   unique IPv6 address that a neighbor\
    \ router needs in order to\n   construct the IPv6 Neighbor Address sub-TLV.\n"
- title: 3.2.4.  IPv4 SRLG TLV
  contents:
  - "3.2.4.  IPv4 SRLG TLV\n   The SRLG TLV (type 138) defined in [GMPLS] contains\
    \ the set of SRLGs\n   associated with a link.  The SRLG TLV identifies the link\
    \ using\n   either local/remote IPv4 addresses or, for point-to-point unnumbered\n\
    \   links, link-local/remote identifiers.  The SRLG TLV includes a flags\n   field\
    \ to indicate which type of identifier is used.\n   When only IPv6 is used, IPv4\
    \ addresses and link-local/remote\n   identifiers are not available to identify\
    \ the link, but IPv6\n   addresses can be used instead.\n   There is no backward-compatible\
    \ way to modify the SRLG TLV (type 138)\n   to identify the link by IPv6 addresses;\
    \ therefore, we need a new TLV.\n   The IPv6 SRLG TLV is defined in Section 4.4.\n"

    \ TLV\n   unchanged to neighbors as normal).\n   Note that this rule for processing\
    \ the flags octet allows for future\n   extensibility of the IPv6 SRLG TLV.  In\
    \ particular, it allows\n   alternative means of identifying the corresponding\

    \ TLV and an IPv6 SRLG TLV in the same logical LSP\n   from causing confusion\
    \ of interpretation, the following rules are\n   applied.\n   -  The IPv6 SRLG\
    \ TLV MAY occur more than once within the IS-IS\n      logical LSP.\n   -  There\
    \ MUST NOT be more than one IPv6 SRLG TLV for a given link.\n   -  The IPv6 SRLG\
    \ TLV (type 139) MUST NOT be used to describe the\n      SRLGs for a given link\
    \ if it is possible to use the SRLG TLV (type\n      138).\n   -  If both an SRLG\
    \ TLV and an IPv6 SRLG are received describing the\n      SRLGs for the same link,\
    \ the receiver MUST apply the SRLG TLV and\n      ignore the IPv6 SRLG TLV.\n\
    \   In other words, if SRLGs are to be advertised for a link and if the\n   Extended\
    \ IS Reachability TLV describing a link contains IPv4\n   interface/neighbor address\
    \ sub-TLVs or the link-local identifiers\n   sub-TLV, then the SRLGs MUST be advertised\
    \ in the SRLG TLV (type\n   138).\n"
