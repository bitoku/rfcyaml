This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB) for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
In particular, it describes a set of managed objects that are used to schedule management operations periodically or at specified dates and times.
The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119
The SNMP Management Framework presently consists of five major components:  An overall architecture, described in RFC 2571
Mechanisms for describing and naming objects and events for the purpose of management.
The first version of this Structure of Management Information (SMI) is called SMIv1 and described in STD 16, RFC 1155
[RFC1155], STD 16, RFC 1212 [RFC1212] and RFC 1215 [RFC1215].
The second version, called SMIv2, is described in STD 58, RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579
[RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
Message protocols for transferring management information.
The first version of the SNMP message protocol is called SNMPv1 and described in STD 15, RFC 1157
A second version of the SNMP message protocol, which is not an Internet standards track protocol, is called SNMPv2c and described in RFC 1901
[RFC1901] and RFC 1906 [RFC1906].
The third version of the message protocol is called SNMPv3 and described in RFC 1906
[RFC1906], RFC 2572 [RFC2572] and RFC 2574
Protocol operations for accessing management information.
The first set of protocol operations and associated PDU formats is described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [RFC1157].
A second set of protocol operations and associated PDU formats is described in RFC 1905 [RFC1905].
A set of fundamental applications described in RFC 2573 [RFC2573] and the view based access control mechanism described in RFC 2575
A more detailed introduction to the current SNMP Management Framework can be found in RFC 2570 [RFC2570].
Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed the Management Information Base or MIB.
Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the SMI.
This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2.
A MIB conforming to the SMIv1 can be produced through the appropriate translations.
The resulting translated MIB must be semantically equivalent, except where objects or events are omitted because no translation is possible (use of Counter64).
Some machine readable information in SMIv2 will be converted into textual descriptions in SMIv1 during the translation process.
However, this loss of machine readable information is not considered to change the semantics of the MIB.
The MIB defined in this memo provides the scheduling of actions periodically or at specified dates and times.
The actions can be used to realize on duty / off duty schedules or to trigger management functions in a distributed management application.
Schedules can be enabled or disabled by modifying a control object.
This allows for pre configured schedules which are activated or deactivated by some other management functions.
The term `scheduler' is used throughout this memo to refer to the entity which implements the scheduling MIB and which invokes the actions at the specified points in time.
Periodic Schedules Periodic schedules are based on fixed time periods between the initiation of scheduled actions.
Periodic schedules are defined by specifying the number of seconds between two initiations.
The time needed to complete the action is usually not known by the scheduler and does therefore not influence the next scheduling point.
Implementations must guarantee that action invocations will not occur before their next scheduled time.
However, implementations may be forced to delay invocations in the face of local constraints (e.g., a heavy load on higher priority tasks).
An accumulation of such delays would result in a drift of the scheduling interval with respect to time, and should be avoided.
Scheduled actions collecting statistical data should retrieve time stamps from the data source and not rely on the accuracy of the periodic scheduler in order to obtain accurate statistics.
Calendar Schedules Calendar schedules trigger scheduled actions at specified days of the week and days of the month.
Calendar schedules are therefore aware of the notion of months, days, weekdays, hours and minutes.
It is possible to specify multiple values for each calendar item.
This provides a mechanism for defining complex schedules.
For example, a schedule could be defined which triggers an action every 15 minutes on a given weekday.
Months, days and weekdays are specified using the objects schedMonth, schedDay and schedWeekDay of type BITS.
Setting multiple bits to one in these objects causes an OR operation.
For example, setting the bits monday(1) and friday(5) in schedWeekDay restricts the schedule to Mondays and Fridays.
The bit fields for schedMonth, schedDay and schedWeekDay are combined using an AND operation.
For example, setting the bits june(5) and july(6) in schedMonth and combining it with the bits monday(1) and friday(5) set in schedWeekDay will result in a schedule which is restricted to every Monday and Friday in the months June and July.
Wildcarding of calendar items is achieved by setting all bits to one.
It is possible to define calendar schedules that will never trigger an action.
For example, one can define a calendar schedule which should trigger an action on February 31st.
Schedules like this will simply be ignored by the scheduler.
Finally, calendar schedules are always expressed in local time.
A scalar, schedLocalTime, is provided so that a manager can retrieve the notion of local time and the offset to GMT time.
One shot Schedules One shot Schedules are similar to calendar schedules.
The difference between a calendar schedule and a one shot schedule is that a one  shot schedule will automatically disable itself once an action has been invoked.
A time transition occurs when the Schedule MIB's notion of time (as reported by schedLocalTime) is changed so that time continuity is lost.
Time transitions may be caused by daylight savings times or administrative changes of the system's notion of time.
There are two possible situations when a time transition occurs.
First, time may be set backwards, in which case particular times will appear to occur twice.
These are called 'ambiguous times'.
Second, time may be set forwards, in which case particular times will not occur.
These are called 'nonexistent times'.
When an action is configured in the Schedule MIB to occur at an ambiguous time, the action will be invoked at all occurrences of the ambiguous time.
For example, if an action is scheduled to occur at 2:10 am, and a time transition occurs at 3:00 am which sets the clock back to 2:00 am, the action will be invoked twice.
When an action is configured in the Schedule MIB to occur at a nonexistent time, the action will not be invoked at all.
For example, if an action is scheduled to occur at 2:10 am, and a time transition occurs at 2:00 am which sets the clock to 3:00 am, the action will not be invoked.
Actions Scheduled actions are modeled by SNMP set operations on local MIB variables.
Scheduled actions described in this MIB are further restricted to objects of type INTEGER.
This restriction does not limit the usefulness of the MIB.
Simple schedules such as on duty / off duty schedules for resources that have a status MIB object (e.g. ifAdminStatus) are possible.
More complex actions can be realized by triggering a management script which is responsible for performing complex state transitions.
A management script can also be used to perform SNMP set operations on remote SNMP engines.

This MIB module defines a MIB which provides mechanisms to schedule SNMP set operations periodically or at specific points in time."
This revision introduces a new object type called schedTriggers.
Created new conformance and compliance statements that take care of the new schedTriggers object.
Several clarifications have been added to remove ambiguities that were discovered and reported by implementors."
The various groups defined within this MIB definition:   schedObjects
"This TC enumerates the SNMPv1
and SNMPv2 PDU error status codes as defined in RFC 1157 and RFC 1905.
It also adds a pseudo error status code `noResponse' which indicates a timeout condition."
Some scalars which provide information about the local time zone.
"The local time used by the scheduler.
Schedules which refer to calendar time will use the local time indicated by this object.
An implementation MUST return all 11 bytes of the DateAndTime textual convention so that a manager may retrieve the offset from GMT time."
SEQUENCE OF SchedEntry MAX ACCESS
"This table defines scheduled actions triggered by SNMP set operations."
{ schedObjects 2 } schedEntry OBJECT TYPE SYNTAX
"An entry describing a particular scheduled action.
Unless noted otherwise, writable objects of this row can be modified independent of the current value of schedRowStatus, schedAdminStatus and schedOperStatus.
In particular, it is legal to modify schedInterval and the objects in the schedCalendarGroup when schedRowStatus is active and schedAdminStatus and schedOperStatus are both enabled.
The owner of this scheduling entry.
The exact semantics of this string are subject to the security policy defined by the security administrator."
The locally unique, administratively assigned name for this scheduling entry.
This object allows a schedOwner to have multiple entries in the schedTable."
"The human readable description of the purpose of this scheduling entry."
"The number of seconds between two action invocations of a periodic scheduler.
Implementations must guarantee that action invocations will not occur before at least schedInterval seconds have passed.
The scheduler must ignore all periodic schedules that have a schedInterval value of 0.
A periodic schedule with a scheduling interval of 0 seconds will therefore never invoke an action.
Implementations may be forced to delay invocations in the face of local constraints.
A scheduled management function should therefore not rely on the accuracy provided by the scheduler implementation.
Note that implementations which maintain a list of pending activations must re calculate them when this object is changed."
, wednesday(3), thursday(4), friday(5), saturday(6)
"The set of weekdays on which the scheduled action should take place.
Setting multiple bits will include several weekdays in the set of possible weekdays for this schedule.
Setting all bits will cause the scheduler to ignore the weekday.
Note that implementations which maintain a list of pending activations must re calculate them when this object is changed."
"The set of months during which the scheduled action should take place.
Setting multiple bits will include several months in the set of possible months for this schedule.
Setting all bits will cause the scheduler to ignore the month.
Note that implementations which maintain a list of pending activations must re calculate them when this object is changed."

The set of days in a month on which a scheduled action should take place.
There are two sets of bits one can use to define the day within a month: Enumerations starting with the letter 'd' indicate a day in a month relative to the first day of a month.
The first day of the month can therefore be specified by setting the bit d1(0) and d31(30) means the last day of a month with 31 days.
Enumerations starting with the letter 'r' indicate a day in a month in reverse order, relative to the last day of a month.
The last day in the month can therefore be specified by setting the bit r1(31) and r31(61) means the first day of a month with 31 days.
Setting multiple bits will include several days in the set of possible days for this schedule.
Setting all bits will cause the scheduler to ignore the day within a month.
Setting all bits starting with the letter 'd' or the letter 'r' will also cause the scheduler to ignore the day within a month.
Note that implementations which maintain a list of pending activations must re calculate them when this object is changed."
"The set of hours within a day during which the scheduled action should take place.
Note that implementations which maintain a list of pending activations must re calculate them when this object is changed."
"The set of minutes within an hour when the scheduled action should take place.
Note that implementations which maintain a list of pending activations must re calculate them when this object is changed."
"The context which contains the local MIB variable pointed to by schedVariable."
schedEntry 10 } schedVariable OBJECT
"An object identifier pointing to a local MIB variable which resolves to an ASN.1 primitive type of INTEGER."
"The value which is written to the MIB object pointed to by schedVariable when the scheduler invokes an action.
The implementation shall enforce the use of access control rules when performing the set operation on schedVariable.
This is accomplished by calling the isAccessAllowed abstract service interface as defined in RFC 2571.
Note that an implementation may choose to issue an SNMP Set message to the SNMP engine and leave the access control decision to the normal message processing procedure."
"The type of this schedule.
The value periodic(1) indicates that this entry specifies a periodic schedule.
A periodic schedule is defined by the value of schedInterval.
The values of schedWeekDay, schedMonth, schedDay, schedHour and schedMinute are ignored.
The value calendar(2) indicates that this entry describes a calendar schedule.
A calendar schedule is defined by the values of schedWeekDay, schedMonth, schedDay, schedHour and schedMinute.
The value of schedInterval is ignored.
A calendar schedule will trigger on all local times that satisfy the bits set in schedWeekDay, schedMonth, schedDay, schedHour and schedMinute.
The value oneshot(3) indicates that this entry describes a one shot schedule.
A one shot schedule is similar to a calendar schedule with the additional feature that it disables itself by changing in the `finished' schedOperStatus once the schedule triggers an action.
Note that implementations which maintain a list of pending activations must re calculate them when this object is changed."
"The desired state of the schedule."
INTEGER { enabled(1), disabled(2), finished(3) }
The current operational state of this schedule.
The state enabled(1) indicates this entry is active and that the scheduler will invoke actions at appropriate times.
The disabled(2) state indicates that this entry is currently inactive and ignored by the scheduler.
The finished(3) state indicates that the schedule has ended.
Schedules in the finished(3) state are ignored by the scheduler.
A one shot schedule enters the finished(3) state when it deactivates itself.
Note that the operational state must not be enabled(1) when the schedRowStatus is not active."
"This variable counts the number of failures while invoking the scheduled action.
This counter at most increments once for a triggered action."
"The most recent error that occurred during the invocation of a scheduled action.
The value noError(0) is returned if no errors have occurred yet.
The date and time when the most recent failure occurred.
The value '0000000000000000'H is returned if no failure occurred since the last re initialization of the scheduler.
"This object defines whether this scheduled action is kept in volatile storage and lost upon reboot or if this row is backed up by non volatile or permanent storage.
Conceptual rows having the value `permanent' must allow write access to the columnar objects schedDescr, schedInterval, schedContextName, schedVariable, schedValue, and schedAdminStatus.
If an implementation supports the schedCalendarGroup, write access must be also allowed to the columnar objects schedWeekDay, schedMonth, schedDay, schedHour, schedMinute.
"The status of this scheduled action.
A control that allows entries to be added and removed from this table.
Note that the operational state must change to enabled when the administrative state is enabled and the row status changes to active(1).
Attempts to destroy(6) a row or to set a row notInService(2) while the operational state is enabled result in inconsistentValue errors.
The value of this object has no effect on whether other objects in this conceptual row can be modified."
"This variable counts the number of attempts (either successful or failed) to invoke the scheduled action."

deprecated DESCRIPTION "A collection of objects providing scheduling capabilities."
This section presents some examples how the scheduling MIB can be used to schedule scripts with the Script MIB [RFC3165] or to realize on duty/off duty schedules by modifying status objects of other MIB modules.
Starting a script to ping devices
every 20 minutes It is assumed that the schedule entry is owned by schedOwner   "joe" and
its name is schedName   "ping".
The instance identifier for the scheduling entry is therefore 3.106.111.101.4.112.105.110.103.
It is further assumed that the smLaunchTable entry is owned by smLaunchOwner
"joe" and its name is smLaunchName   "ping devs".
The complete object identifier for the smLaunchStart object is therefore smLaunchStart.3.106.111.101.9.112.105.110.103.45.100.101.118.115.
The script lives in the context identified by the string "engine1".
The configuration of the scheduler entry which launches the script every 20 minutes would look as follows:
schedInterval.3.106.111.101.4.112.105.110.103   1200 schedValue.3.106.111.101.4.112.105.110.103   0 schedContextName.3.106.111.101.4.112.105.110.103
All the remaining columns in the schedTable represent status information and are not shown here.
Starting a script at the next Friday the 13th
It is assumed that the schedule entry is owned by schedOwner   "joe" and
its name is schedName   "13th".
The instance identifier for the scheduling entry is therefore 3.106.111.101.4.49.51.116.104.
It is further assumed that the smLaunchTable entry is owned by smLaunchOwner
"joe" and its name is smLaunchName   "ghost".
The complete object identifier for the smLaunchStart object is therefore smLaunchStart.3.106.111.101.5.103.104.111.115.116.
The script lives in the context identified by the string "engine1".
The configuration of the scheduler entry which launches the script on the next Friday 13th at midnight would look as follows:
All the remaining columns in the schedTable represent status information and are not shown here.
Turning an interface off during weekends This example assumes that a network interface should be taken down during weekends.
The interface table (ifTable) of the IF MIB [RFC2863] is assumed to exist in the context identified by an empty string and the index of the interface
The scheduling entry which brings the interface down on every Friday evening at 20:30 (8:30 pm) is owned by schedOwner   "bob" and
The instance identifier for the scheduling entry is therefore 3.98.111.98.6.105.102.45.111.102.102.
The scheduling entry which brings the interface up on every Monday morning at 5:30 is owned by schedOwner   "bob" and
The instance identifier for the scheduling entry is therefore 3.98.111.98.5.105.102.45.111.110.
A similar configuration could be used to control other schedules.
For example, one could change the "if on" and "if off" schedules to enable and disable the periodic scheduler defined in the first example.
There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB that have a MAX ACCESS clause of read write and/or read create.
Such objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.
The support for SET operations in a non secure environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on network operations.
by itself is not a secure environment.
Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec), even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is allowed to access and
the objects in this MIB.
It is recommended that the implementers consider the security features as provided by the SNMPv3 framework.
Specifically, the use of the User based Security Model RFC 2574
[RFC2574] and the View  based Access Control Model RFC 2575
It is then a customer/user responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an instance of this MIB, is properly configured to give access to the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate rights to indeed GET or SET
Scheduled SNMP set operations must use the security credentials that were present when the corresponding row in the scheduling entry was created.
An implementation must therefore record and maintain the credentials for every scheduling entry.
An implementation must ensure that access control rules are applied when doing the set operation.
This is accomplished by calling the isAccessAllowed abstract service interface defined in RFC 2571
The securityModel, securityName and securityLevel parameters are set to the values that were recorded when the scheduling entry was created.
The viewType parameter must select the write view and the contextName and variableName parameters are taken from the schedContextName and schedVariableName values of the scheduling entry.
This MIB limits scheduled actions to objects in the local MIB.
This avoids security problems with the delegation of access rights.
However, it might be possible for a user of this MIB to own some schedules that might trigger far in the future.
This can cause security risks if the security administrator did not properly update the access control lists when a user is withdrawn from an SNMP engine.
Therefore, entries in the schedTable SHOULD be cleaned up whenever a user is removed from an SNMP engine.
To facilitate the provisioning of access control by a security administrator using the View Based Access Control Model (VACM) defined in RFC 2575
[RFC2575] for tables in which multiple users may need to independently create or modify entries, the initial index is used as an "owner index".
Such an initial index has a syntax of SnmpAdminString, and can thus be trivially mapped to a securityName or groupName as defined in VACM, in accordance with a security policy.
All entries in related tables belonging to a particular user will have the same value for this initial index.
For a given user's entries in a particular table, the object identifiers for the information in these entries will have the same subidentifiers (except for the "column" subidentifier) up to the end of the encoded owner index.
To configure VACM to permit access to this portion of the table, one would create vacmViewTreeFamilyTable entries with the value of vacmViewTreeFamilySubtree including the owner index portion, and vacmViewTreeFamilyMask "wildcarding" the column subidentifier.
More elaborate configurations are possible.
The following list documents major changes from the previous version of this document, published as RFC 2591:  Updated the SNMP Management Framework boilerplate and the references.
Added revision clauses to the module identity macro.
Clarified the behavior during time transitions.
Clarified that schedInterval and schedCalendarGroup objects can be modified regardless of the current value of schedRowStatus, schedAdminStatus and schedOperStatus.
Added some additional boilerplate text to the security considerations section.
Clarified that implementations must re calculate any pending action invocations when scheduling parameters are modified.
Clarified that schedOperStatus must not be enabled while the schedRowStatus is not active.
Clarified that schedRowStatus can not be changed as long as the schedOperStatus is enabled.
Clarified that implementations can delegate the isAccessAllowed check by sending themself an SNMP Set message.
Added the schedTriggers object which counts the total number of triggers.
Added DEFVALs for schedContextName, schedVariable, and schedValue and updated the schedRowStatus description.
created schedCompliance2 and schedGroup2 that take care of the new schedTriggers object.
