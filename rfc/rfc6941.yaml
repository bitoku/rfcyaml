  - "1.  Introduction\n   This document provides a security framework for the MPLS\
    \ Transport\n   Profile (MPLS-TP).\n   As defined in \"Requirements of an MPLS\
    \ Transport Profile\" [RFC5654]\n   and \"A Framework for MPLS in Transport Networks\"\
    \ [RFC5921], MPLS-TP\n   uses a subset of MPLS features and introduces extensions\
    \ to reflect\n   the characteristics of the transport technology.  The additional\n\
    \   functionality includes in-band OAM, transport-oriented path\n   protection\
    \ and recovery mechanisms, and new OAM capabilities that\n   were developed for\
    \ MPLS-TP but that also apply to MPLS and GMPLS.\n   There is strong emphasis\
    \ in MPLS-TP on static provisioning support\n   through Network Management Systems\
    \ (NMSs) or Operational Support\n   Systems (OSSs).\n   This document is built\
    \ on [RFC5920] by providing additional security\n   considerations that are applicable\
    \ to the MPLS-TP extensions.  The\n   security models, threats, and defense techniques\
    \ previously defined\n   in [RFC5920] are assumed to apply to general aspects\
    \ of MPLS-TP.\n   This document is a product of a joint Internet Engineering Task\
    \ Force\n   (IETF) / International Telecommunication Union Telecommunication\n\
    \   Standardization Sector (ITU-T) effort to include an MPLS Transport\n   Profile\
    \ within the IETF MPLS and PWE3 architectures to support the\n   capabilities\
    \ and functionality of a packet transport network.\n   Readers can refer to [RFC5654]\
    \ and [RFC5921] for MPLS-TP\n   terminologies and to [RFC5920] for security terminologies\
    \ that are\n   relevant to MPLS and GMPLS.\n"

- title: 2.  Security Reference Models
  contents:
  - "2.  Security Reference Models\n   This section defines reference models for security\
    \ in MPLS-TP\n   networks.\n   The models are built on the architecture of MPLS-TP,\
    \ as defined in\n   [RFC5921].  The placement of SP boundaries plays an important\
    \ role in\n   determining the security models for any particular deployment.\n\
    \   This document defines a trusted zone as being where a single SP has\n   total\
    \ operational control over that part of the network.  A primary\n   concern is\
    \ about security aspects that relate to breaches of security\n   from the \"outside\"\
    \ of a trusted zone to the \"inside\" of this zone.\n"

- title: 3.  Security Threats
  contents:
  - "3.  Security Threats\n   This section discusses various network security threats\
    \ that are\n   unique to MPLS-TP and may endanger MPLS-TP networks.\n   Attacks\
    \ against a GAL or G-ACh may include the following:\n   - GAL or BFD label manipulation,\
    \ which includes insertion of false\n     labels and modification, deletion, or\
    \ replay of messages.\n   - DoS attacks through in-band OAM by generating excessive\
    \ G-ACh/GAL\n     and BFD messages that consume significant bandwidth and potentially\n\
    \     cause congestion.\n   These attacks can cause unauthorized protection switchover,\
    \ inability\n   to restore one or more LSPs, or loss of network connectivity.\n\
    \   When an NMS is used for LSP setup, attacks on the NMS can cause the\n   above\
    \ effects as well.  Although this is not unique to MPLS-TP,\n   MPLS-TP networks\
    \ can be particularly vulnerable to NMS attacks, due\n   to the fact that static\
    \ provisioning through NMSs is a commonly used\n   model.  In the static provisioning\
    \ model, a compromised NMS can\n   potentially be comparable to a compromised\
    \ control plane plus a\n   compromised management plane in the dynamic controlled\
    \ network model.\n   Attacks on NMSs may come from either external attackers or\
    \ insiders.\n   Outside attacks are initiated outside of the trusted zone by\n\
    \   unauthorized users of the MPLS-TP NMSs.  Insider attacks are\n   initiated\
    \ from inside the trusted zone by an entity that has\n   authorized access to\
    \ the management systems but that performs\n   unapproved functions that are harmful\
    \ to the MPLS-TP networks.  These\n   attacks may directly target the NMS; they\
    \ may also take place via the\n   compromised communication channels between the\
    \ NMS and the network\n   devices that are being provisioned, or through user\
    \ access to the\n   provisioning tools.  This type of security threat may include\n\
    \   disclosure of information, generating false OAM messages, taking down\n  \
    \ MPLS-TP LSPs, connecting to the wrong MPLS-TP tunnel endpoints, and\n   DoS\
    \ attacks on the MPLS-TP networks.\n   There are other more generic security threats,\
    \ such as unauthorized\n   observation of data traffic (including traffic pattern\
    \ analysis),\n   modification or deletion of a provider's or user's data, and\
    \ replay\n   or insertion of inauthentic data into a provider's or user's data\n\
    \   stream.  These types of attacks apply to MPLS-TP traffic regardless\n   of\
    \ how the LSP or PW is set up, in a way that is similar to how they\n   apply\
    \ to MPLS traffic regardless of how the LSP is set up.  More\n   details on the\
    \ above-mentioned threats are documented in [RFC5920].\n   Such threats may result\
    \ from malicious behavior or accidental errors:\n   Example 1: Attacks from users:\
    \ Users of the MPLS-TP network may\n      attack the network infrastructure or\
    \ attack other users.\n   Example 2: Attacks from insiders: Employees of the operators\
    \ may\n      attack the MPLS-TP network, especially through NMSs.\n   Example\
    \ 3: Attacks from interconnecting SPs or other partners: Other\n      SPs may\
    \ attack the MPLS-TP network, particularly through the\n      inter-provider connections.\n\
    \   Example 4: Attacks as the result of operational errors: Operations\n     \
    \ staff may fail to follow operational procedures or may make\n      operational\
    \ mistakes.\n"

  - "4.  Defensive Techniques\n   The defensive techniques presented in this document\
    \ and in [RFC5920]\n   are intended to describe methods by which some security\
    \ threats can\n   be addressed.  They are not intended as requirements for all\
    \ MPLS-TP\n   deployments.  The specific operational environment determines the\n\
    \   security requirements for any instance of MPLS-TP.  Therefore,\n   protocol\
    \ designers should provide a full set of security capabilities\n   that can be\
    \ selected and used where appropriate.  The MPLS-TP\n   provider should determine\
    \ the applicability of these techniques to\n   the provider's specific service\
    \ offerings, and the end user may wish\n   to assess the value of these techniques\
    \ to the user's service\n   requirements.\n   Authentication is the primary defense\
    \ technique to mitigate the risk\n   of the MPLS-TP security threats discussed\
    \ in Section 3 (GAL or BFD\n   label manipulation, and DoS attacks through in-band\
    \ OAM).\n   Authentication refers to methods to ensure that message sources are\n\
    \   properly identified by the MPLS-TP devices with which they\n   communicate.\
    \  Authentication includes the following:\n   - entity authentication for identity\
    \ verification\n   - management system authentication\n   - peer-to-peer authentication\n\
    \   - message integrity and replay detection to ensure the validity of\n     message\
    \ streams\n   - network-based access controls such as packet filtering and\n \
    \    firewalls\n   - host-based access controls\n   - isolation\n   - aggregation\n\
    \   - protection against denial of service\n   - event logging\n   Section 5.2\
    \ of [RFC5920] describes these techniques where they apply\n   to MPLS and GMPLS\
    \ in general.\n   In addition to authentication, the following defense should\
    \ also be\n   considered in order to protect MPLS-TP networks:\n   - Use of isolated\
    \ infrastructure for MPLS-TP\n   One way to protect the MPLS-TP infrastructure\
    \ is to use dedicated\n   network resources to provide MPLS-TP transport services.\
    \  For\n   example, in security model 2 (Section 2.2), the potential risk of\n\
    \   attacks on the S-PE1 or T-PE1 in the trusted zone may be reduced by\n   using\
    \ non-IP-based communication paths, so that the paths in the\n   trusted zone\
    \ cannot be reached from the outside via IP.\n   - Verification of connectivity\n\
    \   To protect against deliberate or accidental misconnection, mechanisms\n  \
    \ can be put in place to verify both end-to-end connectivity and\n   segment-by-segment\
    \ resources.  These mechanisms can trace the routes\n   of LSPs in both the control\
    \ plane and the data plane.  Note that the\n   connectivity verification tools\
    \ are now developed for general MPLS\n   networks as well.\n   The defense techniques\
    \ that apply generally to MPLS/GMPLS are not\n   detailed here; see [RFC5920]\
    \ for details regarding these techniques.\n   For example:\n   1) Authentication,\
    \ including management system authentication,\n      peer-to-peer authentication,\
    \ and cryptographic techniques for\n      authenticating identity\n   2) Access\
    \ control techniques\n   3) Use of aggregated infrastructure\n   4) Mitigation\
    \ of denial-of-service attacks\n   5) Monitoring, detection, and reporting of\
    \ security attacks\n   It is important to point out the following security defense\n\
    \   techniques, as they are particularly critical for NMSs, due to the\n   strong\
    \ emphasis on static provisioning supported by NMSs in MPLS-TP\n   deployments.\
    \  These techniques include the following:\n   - entity authentication for identity\
    \ verification\n   - encryption for confidentiality\n   - message integrity and\
    \ replay detection to ensure the validity of\n     message streams\n   - user\
    \ access control and event logging, which must be applied for\n     NMSs and provisioning\
    \ applications\n"

  - "5.  Security Considerations\n   Security considerations constitute the sole subject\
    \ of this document\n   and hence are discussed throughout.\n   This document evaluates\
    \ security risks specific to MPLS-TP, as well\n   as mitigation mechanisms that\
    \ may be used to counter potential\n   threats.  All of the techniques presented\
    \ here involve mature and\n   widely implemented technologies that are practical\
    \ to implement.  It\n   is meant to assist equipment vendors and service providers\
    \ who must\n   ultimately decide what threats to protect against in any given\n\
    \   configuration or service offering, from a customer's perspective as\n   well\
    \ as from a service provider's perspective.\n"
