  - "1.  Introduction\n   This document describes the use of AES in GCM mode (AES-GCM)\
    \ as an\n   IPsec ESP mechanism for confidentiality and data origin\n   authentication.\
    \  We refer to this method as AES-GCM-ESP.  This\n   mechanism is not only efficient\
    \ and secure, but it also enables\n   high-speed implementations in hardware.\
    \  Thus, AES-GCM-ESP allows\n   IPsec connections that can make effective use\
    \ of emerging 10-gigabit\n   and 40-gigabit network devices.\n   Counter mode\
    \ (CTR) has emerged as the preferred encryption method for\n   high-speed implementations.\
    \  Unlike conventional encryption modes\n   such as Cipher Block Chaining (CBC)\
    \ and Cipher Block Chaining Message\n   Authentication Code (CBC-MAC), CTR can\
    \ be efficiently implemented at\n   high data rates because it can be pipelined.\
    \  The ESP CTR protocol\n   describes how this mode can be used with IPsec ESP\
    \ [RFC3686].\n   Unfortunately, CTR provides no data origin authentication, and\
    \ thus\n   the ESP CTR standard requires the use of a data origin authentication\n\
    \   algorithm in conjunction with CTR.  This requirement is problematic,\n   because\
    \ none of the standard data origin authentication algorithms\n   can be efficiently\
    \ implemented for high data rates.  GCM solves this\n   problem, because under\
    \ the hood, it combines CTR mode with a secure,\n   parallelizable, and efficient\
    \ authentication mechanism.\n   This document does not cover implementation details\
    \ of GCM.  Those\n   details can be found in [GCM], along with test vectors.\n"

- title: 2.  AES-GCM
  contents:
  - "2.  AES-GCM\n   GCM is a block cipher mode of operation providing both\n   confidentiality\
    \ and data origin authentication.  The GCM\n   authenticated encryption operation\
    \ has four inputs: a secret key, an\n   initialization vector (IV), a plaintext,\
    \ and an input for additional\n   authenticated data (AAD).  It has two outputs,\
    \ a ciphertext whose\n   length is identical to the plaintext, and an authentication\
    \ tag.  In\n   the following, we describe how the IV, plaintext, and AAD are formed\n\
    \   from the ESP fields, and how the ESP packet is formed from the\n   ciphertext\
    \ and authentication tag.\n   ESP also defines an IV.  For clarity, we refer to\
    \ the AES-GCM IV as a\n   nonce in the context of AES-GCM-ESP.  The same nonce\
    \ and key\n   combination MUST NOT be used more than once.\n   Because reusing\
    \ an nonce/key combination destroys the security\n   guarantees of AES-GCM mode,\
    \ it can be difficult to use this mode\n   securely when using statically configured\
    \ keys.  For safety's sake,\n   implementations MUST use an automated key management\
    \ system, such as\n   the Internet Key Exchange (IKE) [RFC2409], to ensure that\
    \ this\n   requirement is met.\n"

  contents:
  - "10.  Security Considerations\n   GCM is provably secure against adversaries that\
    \ can adaptively choose\n   plaintexts, ciphertexts, ICVs, and the AAD field,\
    \ under standard\n   cryptographic assumptions (roughly, that the output of the\
    \ underlying\n   cipher, under a randomly chosen key, is indistinguishable from\
    \ a\n   randomly selected output).  Essentially, this means that, if used\n  \
    \ within its intended parameters, a break of GCM implies a break of the\n   underlying\
    \ block cipher.  The proof of security for GCM is available\n   in [GCM].\n  \
    \ The most important security consideration is that the IV never repeat\n   for\
    \ a given key.  In part, this is handled by disallowing the use of\n   AES-GCM\
    \ when using statically configured keys, as discussed in\n   Section 2.\n   When\
    \ IKE is used to establish fresh keys between two peer entities,\n   separate\
    \ keys are established for the two traffic flows.  If a\n   different mechanism\
    \ is used to establish fresh keys (one that\n   establishes only a single key\
    \ to encrypt packets), then there is a\n   high probability that the peers will\
    \ select the same IV values for\n   some packets.  Thus, to avoid counter block\
    \ collisions, ESP\n   implementations that permit use of the same key for encrypting\
    \ and\n   decrypting packets with the same peer MUST ensure that the two peers\n\
    \   assign different salt values to the security association (SA).\n   The other\
    \ consideration is that, as with any encryption mode, the\n   security of all\
    \ data protected under a given security association\n   decreases slightly with\
    \ each message.\n   To protect against this problem, implementations MUST generate\
    \ a\n   fresh key before encrypting 2^64 blocks of data with a given key.\n  \
    \ Note that it is impossible to reach this limit when using 32-bit\n   Sequence\
    \ Numbers.\n   Note that, for each message, GCM calls the block cipher once for\
    \ each\n   full 16-octet block in the payload, once for any remaining octets in\n\
    \   the payload, and one additional time for computing the ICV.\n   Clearly, smaller\
    \ ICV values are more likely to be subject to forgery\n   attacks.  Implementations\
    \ SHOULD use as large a size as reasonable.\n"

  contents:

    \ while\n   promoting simple, efficient implementations in both hardware and\n\
    \   software.  We re-use the design and implementation experience from\n   those\
    \ standards.\n   The major difference with CCM is that the CCM ESP mechanism requires\n\
    \   an 11-octet nonce, whereas the GCM ESP mechanism requires using a\n   12-octet\
    \ nonce.  GCM is specially optimized to handle the 12-octet\n   nonce case efficiently.\
    \  Nonces of other lengths would cause\n   unnecessary, additional complexity\
    \ and delays, particularly in\n   hardware implementations.  The additional octet\
    \ of nonce is used to\n   increase the size of the salt.\n"
