- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   This document contains simple guidelines that can help you\
    \ to gain\n   prominence and influence in most standards, and many other human,\n\
    \   organizations.  It takes only normal communications and technical\n   skills\
    \ and moderate effort to follow these guidelines.\n"
- title: 2.  Human Organizations
  contents:
  - "2.  Human Organizations\n   All organizations composed of human beings give the\
    \ appearance to\n   newcomers of having an inner clique that runs things.  This\
    \ happens\n   whether there is a semi-permanent cohesive inside group that actually\n\
    \   tries to keep all power in its own hands or those in positions of\n   power\
    \ are genuinely trying to be open and willing to share and there\n   is a system\
    \ for their regular replacement.  It is just the nature of\n   human society.\
    \  It always takes time and effort to get to know new\n   people. [Carnegie]\n\
    \   All organizations have procedures.  It always takes time and effort\n   to\
    \ learn how things are done in an organization.  In an organization\n   of any\
    \ size, those who happen to be in positions of authority can't\n   spend equal\
    \ time talking with everyone about every issue in the\n   organization.  Their\
    \ positions mean they will necessarily be in many\n   conversations with each\
    \ other and fewer conversations with the\n   average member.  And there are some\
    \ types of information that should\n   normally be kept confidential, at least\
    \ until verified, and sometimes\n   even then.  Examples are charges of ethical\
    \ or other violations\n   against individuals.\n   But, despite all this, following\
    \ some simple guidelines can greatly\n   accelerate the rate at which you will\
    \ become favorably known in an\n   organization.  Favorable prominence can increase\
    \ your chance of being\n   selected for positions such as editorship of documents,\
    \ secretary or\n   clerk of a group (so you get to produce the record of what\
    \ *actually*\n   happened), or possibly even some level of chair or deputy chair\n\
    \   position.\n"
- title: 3.  Eighty Percent of Success is Showing Up
  contents:
  - "3.  Eighty Percent of Success is Showing Up\n   It is the simplest thing! If\
    \ you are absent, how can you have much\n   prominence or influence?\n   This\
    \ applies to all venues, email/messaging, telephone/video\n   conference, and\
    \ especially in-person or face-to-face meetings.  You\n   do not need 100% attendance,\
    \ but your absences should be rare.  If\n   possible, only miss less important\
    \ events.\n   Attendance is obviously most important at meetings of the specific\n\
    \   body in which you are interested.  But you should also watch for\n   higher-level\
    \ or lower-level meetings that are open.  Many standards\n   groups have a multi-level\
    \ structure.  As well as attending the group\n   you are interested in, if there\
    \ are open meetings of various group\n   chairs or the like, attending those can\
    \ be a fast track, even if you\n   only get to observe and be noticed.  And if\
    \ there are sub-groups of\n   the group you are most interested in, consider attending\
    \ them also to\n   become better known more quickly.  These meetings may be before\
    \ the\n   beginning or after the end of the regular member meetings, so, if you\n\
    \   are really serious, you should be prepared to arrive early and leave\n   late.\n"
- title: 4.  Sit Up Front
  contents:
  - "4.  Sit Up Front\n   If a meeting is very small, say less than 20 people, it\
    \ does not make\n   much difference.  But for meetings of any size, especially\
    \ when\n   starting with an organization, sit up front.  Do not be afraid of the\n\
    \   first row even if it is empty, although the second and sometimes even\n  \
    \ the third are not too bad.  Show up early if you need to, but this is\n   usually\
    \ not necessary, as most people are extraordinarily reluctant\n   to put themselves\
    \ in an exposed place like the front row.\n   After you have some experience,\
    \ you may decide to sit with some group\n   that sits together.  But, in larger\
    \ meetings, the prominent people\n   generally sit either near the front, or way\
    \ at the back.  (Being in\n   the back, at least in large rooms, may mean you\
    \ can wander around and\n   talk to people without disrupting things.)\n"
- title: 5.  Break Bread
  contents:
  - "5.  Break Bread\n   All meetings of any length include refreshment and meals.\
    \  Otherwise\n   the attendees would starve.\n   If there is a group catered meal,\
    \ try sitting with different groups\n   or factions to get an idea of the different\
    \ viewpoints in the\n   organization.  Or try to sit at a table and eat with people\
    \ who have\n   some seniority and experience in the organization, if they seem\n\
    \   receptive.\n   Usually, for multi-day meetings, there is at least one big\
    \ social\n   event where the attendees can get together.  From small meetings\n\
    \   (attendance under 100) and medium size (attendance under 500 or so)\n   meetings,\
    \ it is common for people to go to the social event.\n   Typically some alcohol\
    \ is available, people are more relaxed and\n   informal.  These are good events\
    \ at which to approach high-level\n   officials to exchange a pleasant word or\
    \ two, or even make a small\n   request.  But do not expect to engage in detailed\
    \ technical\n   discussions, although this sometimes happens.\n   Social events\
    \ are commonly at noisy locations.  Sometimes, as\n   organizations get larger,\
    \ social events get so large and congested\n   that many of the most prominent\
    \ people schedule informal meetings\n   opposite them.  You will have to see how\
    \ it works in your\n   organization.\n   But there will also be plenty of informal\
    \ lunch, dinner, and maybe\n   breakfast groups (unless they are all catered)\
    \ and other get-\n   togethers.  At some standards meetings, you can more or less\
    \ invite\n   yourself along to such meal groups, unless they are a small\n   confidential\
    \ group or a group of employees of a particular company,\n   or the like.  Usually\
    \ people will warn you if the group plans to\n   spend much of the meal discussing\
    \ some particular issue, and you can\n   then decide if you want to go with them.\n"
- title: 6.  Develop Friends and Mentors
  contents:
  - "6.  Develop Friends and Mentors\n   It is hard to get things done and learn what\
    \ is going on entirely by\n   yourself.  If you can, find a few people with more\
    \ experience that\n   you can go to with questions.\n   Introduce yourself to\
    \ people and be friendly.  But do not necessarily\n   link up with the first people\
    \ you meet.  You want people who are\n   knowledgeable and well-regarded within\
    \ the organization.\n   If you follow the advice in section 7 below, you should\
    \ have plenty\n   of opportunity to meet experienced people in an organization.\n"
- title: 7.  Be Helpful
  contents:
  - "7.  Be Helpful\n   Within reason, volunteer to do some of the drudgery for which\
    \ you are\n   competent, such as taking notes during meetings, helping someone\
    \ else\n   draft a proposal, or volunteering to re-write part of a draft for\n\
    \   clarity and consistency.\n   This sort of thing will get you noticed and put\
    \ some people in your\n   debt, at least in a minor way.  But be careful not to\
    \ volunteer for\n   more than you can actually do.  Failing to follow through\
    \ will damage\n   your reputation.  If you do get over committed, seek help as\
    \ soon as\n   you realize it.  The worst thing is to fail to meet your promises\
    \ and\n   not let anyone know about it until it is too late for them to\n   recover.\n"
- title: 8.  Learn The Traditions and Rules
  contents:
  - "8.  Learn The Traditions and Rules\n   It is quite important to know the traditions\
    \ of an organization, how\n   things get done, what rules are ignored, how rules\
    \ are interpreted,\n   and what rules are rigorously enforced.\n   While traditions\
    \ are more important, it cannot hurt to also know the\n   official rules and procedures.\
    \  The probability that low level groups\n   in the organization actually operate\
    \ according to the officially\n   adopted rules and procedures in detail is quite\
    \ low, unless the\n   organization has very informal rules.\n   Do not object\
    \ to procedure just for the sake of objecting.  If you\n   repeatedly invoke little\
    \ known and rarely used official rules in\n   small matters, it is a sure way\
    \ to make people assume that what you\n   have to say is silly or obstructionist,\
    \ until proven otherwise.  If\n   you invoke the official rules so as to override\
    \ tradition in an\n   important matter, be aware that you are playing with a weapon\
    \ of mass\n   destruction.  You may or may not accomplish your immediate goal,\
    \ but\n   the blowback will almost certainly damage your future efforts in that\n\
    \   organization.\n   While it is always the path of least resistance to follow\
    \ tradition,\n   knowing the official rules makes you aware of when they could\
    \ be\n   invoked against you.  This may enable you to adopt a path that is\n \
    \  reasonably congruent with both the traditions and the rules,\n   maximizing\
    \ your chances of success.\n"
- title: 9.  Acronyms and Special Terms
  contents:
  - "9.  Acronyms and Special Terms\n   Essentially all technical efforts wallow in\
    \ acronyms and special\n   \"terms of art\".  It sometimes seems as if no effort\
    \ or sub-effort is\n   really rolling until it has come up with several non-obvious\
    \ terms to\n   confuse those who have not been involved for a while.  Nor are\n\
    \   acronyms constant.  Especially in the early part of a standards\n   effort,\
    \ when ideas are flopping around, acronyms and special terms\n   frequently change,\
    \ causing further confusion of those not in the most\n   active part of the group.\n\
    \   In fact, if you read an explanation of some deep technical matter\n   written\
    \ so anyone can understand it, you can be virtually certain\n   that it is not\
    \ how experts in the field communicate with each other,\n   verbally or in writing.\
    \  This is true of all fields.  Read something\n   about engineering big \"air\
    \ vents\" and \"water pipes\"? Experts use\n   \"plenum\" and \"penstock\".\n\
    \   It's a bad strategy to get lost in acronyms you do not know, so you\n   cannot\
    \ understand what people are talking about and may make a fool\n   of yourself\
    \ if you guess wrong.  The best thing is to find out the\n   meaning of and learn\
    \ the acronyms in advance.  Failing that, ask\n   about acronyms or strange terms\
    \ as soon as you can, preferably the\n   first time you encounter them.  Making\
    \ a written note of their\n   meaning could not hurt.  Usually there will be others\
    \ who also wanted\n   to ask but were afraid to and will be grateful that you\
    \ took the\n   initiative.\n"
- title: 10.  Pick Your Points
  contents:
  - "10.  Pick Your Points\n   Think a bit about the impression you make on people.\n\
    \   If you insist on speaking to every issue, even if you don't have any\n   really\
    \ strong points, you will get a reputation as a blowhard who\n   doesn't add much\
    \ and just slows things down.  If you only speak\n   occasionally, but have solid\
    \ points to make when you do, people will\n   pay much more attention to your\
    \ occasional speeches.\n   Similarly, if you quibble about everything, you will\
    \ use up good will\n   you have acquired and may be viewed as an obstructionist\
    \ who causes\n   needless delay.  If an organization is doing or developing something\n\
    \   complex, all the decisions are not going to go the way you want.\n   Consider\
    \ the points where you could try to get your way, figure out\n   how important\
    \ they are to you, how strong your arguments would be,\n   and how much opposition\
    \ you are likely to encounter.  Keep in mind\n   that your arguments will usually\
    \ seem more impressive to you than\n   they do to others.  Based on this, you\
    \ can make a reasoned choice of\n   where to really put up a fight and possibly\
    \ recruit allies or call in\n   favors.\n   This is not to say that you should\
    \ ignore minor issues and never\n   speak up about them if you have new information\
    \ or opinions to\n   contribute.  Just do not invest a lot of effort in fighting\
    \ an issue\n   or making a point unless it is important to you and you judge that\n\
    \   you have a reasonable chance of succeeding.\n"
- title: 11.  Technical and Communications Skill
  contents:
  - "11.  Technical and Communications Skill\n   You may be surprised that I have\
    \ said very little about technical and\n   communication skills, although in the\
    \ Introduction above it was\n   assumed that you had normal skills in these areas.\
    \  You do need to\n   understand the technical aspects of what is going on so\
    \ that you\n   cannot be easily bamboozled.\n   If you are very strong technically\
    \ and can make substantial\n   contributions, you can be helpful, if you can contribute\
    \ in a way\n   that does not offend too many people.  But, especially in a large\n\
    \   technical standards body, not everyone can be a strong technical\n   contributor.\n\
    \   If you have strong verbal and written communications skills, this can\n  \
    \ also be helpful.  But if you are not fluent in the dominant language\n   of\
    \ the organization, you will be at a disadvantage.  While the\n   organization\
    \ should make some attempt to be approachable by those for\n   whom its dominant\
    \ language is a second language, the best thing to do\n   is to put in the time\
    \ and effort to become fluent. [Farber]  As a\n   stopgap, you can team up with\
    \ someone with whom you communicate well\n   and who is fluent in the standards\
    \ organization language.  They can\n   speak for you in meetings, if necessary,\
    \ and co-author written\n   contributions with you.\n   If you are the rare genius\
    \ with superb technical, communication, and\n   interpersonal skills, you are\
    \ wasting your time reading this and\n   might be able to get away with doing\
    \ exactly the opposite of some of\n   its recommendations.  But I would not count\
    \ on it.\n"
- title: 12.  Do Not Try Too Hard
  contents:
  - "12.  Do Not Try Too Hard\n   Lastly, give yourself a bit of time to get settled\
    \ into an\n   organization.  Then, be reasonably assertive, but do not be too\
    \ pushy\n   unless an issue is so important you are willing to risk the\n   reputation\
    \ you have built up.  And try to never lose your temper.\n   Unless you are a\
    \ genius at inter-personal relations, you will not\n   gain substantial prominence\
    \ and influence in a standards organization\n   overnight.  These things take\
    \ time and patience.\n"
