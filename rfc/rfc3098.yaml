- title: 1. Introduction
  contents:
  - "1. Introduction\n   The Internet is not a free resource.  Access to and a presence\
    \ on the\n   'Net comes at a cost to the participants, the service provider, and\n\
    \   the recipients of those services made available by the Internet.  The\n  \
    \ more readily available internet has allowed users access to an\n   unprecedented\
    \ number of people.  Due to the rapid growth and\n   \"mainstream\" acceptance\
    \ of the 'Net, new opportunities have been\n   found for the distribution of information\
    \ to the vast and ever-\n   growing community of Internet users.  There are groups\
    \ and\n   individuals who choose to use the 'Net for purposes for which it was\n\
    \   not intended, thus defying the consensus among both the practitioners\n  \
    \ and the unwilling recipients.  The aforementioned practice, of\n   course, is\
    \ the sending of Unsolicited Commercial and Bulk E-Mail\n   messages, posts to\
    \ Netnews groups, or other unsolicited electronic\n   communication.  This condition\
    \ has caused an awakening on the part of\n   the Internet community-at-large.\n\
    \   There are stereotypes that must be broken before continuing.  Not all\n  \
    \ persons who are new to the Internet are ignorant of the 'Net's\n   history and\
    \ evolution, or its proper and ethical uses.  Nor are all\n   experienced, long-term\
    \ Netizens against the use of the Internet for\n   advertising, marketing, or\
    \ other business purposes.  Where these two\n   groups can find commonality is\
    \ in their opposition to the use of the\n   Internet in irresponsible ways.  Some\
    \ of these irresponsible uses\n   include, but are not limited to, the sending\
    \ of Unsolicited Bulk or\n   Commercial E-Mail to mailing lists, individuals,\
    \ or netnews groups.\n   In the vernacular, this activity is called \"spamming\"\
    \ (the sending of\n   \"spam\" [1]).  To understand why such activities are irresponsible,\n\
    \   one must first understand the true cost and ramifications of such\n   actions.\n\
    \   The protocols and architecture upon which the 'Net is built, which\n   are\
    \ recognized and adhered to as standards, provide for an openness\n   and availability\
    \ which foster and encourage easy communication.\n   These standards were developed\
    \ at a time when there was no need to\n   consider the concept of \"rejecting\"\
    \ information.  While those\n   standards have evolved, they continue to emphasize\
    \ open\n   communication.  As such, they do not associate costs or impact with\n\
    \   the user-initiated activities which may occur.  Because of this\n   openness,\
    \ persons can and do send large volumes of E-Mail, with\n   little-to-no cost\
    \ or financial impact for the volume of messages\n   sent.  Needless to say, this\
    \ presents the attractive option (to those\n   who would consider such activity)\
    \ of multiplying the recipients of\n   their marketing material, and presumably,\
    \ increasing their success-\n   rate.  However, and to reiterate an earlier statement\
    \ in this text,\n   there is a cost to be incurred at some point in this communication\n\
    \   relationship.  In the case of E-Mail advertising, since the cost of\n   operation\
    \ does not increase on the part of the sender, it must\n   therefore increase\
    \ on the side of the recipient.\n   And it does.  Every recipient of every E-Mail\
    \ message bears a cost,\n   either direct (cost per message received, an incremental\
    \ increase in\n   connection charges) or indirect (higher service fees to recoup\n\
    \   infrastructural costs associated with the additional 'Net traffic\n   which\
    \ such mass-mailings create).  In addition, other resources, such\n   as the disk\
    \ space and time of the recipient, are consumed.\n   Because the recipients have\
    \ no control over whether or not they will\n   receive such messages, the aforementioned\
    \ costs are realized\n   involuntarily, and without consent.  It is this condition\
    \ (the\n   absence of consent to bear the costs of receipt of a mass-\n   distributed\
    \ message) that has shaped the Internet Community's\n   viewpoint - that the act\
    \ of sending spam constitutes a willful theft\n   of service, money, and/or resources.\
    \  Those who choose to ignore the\n   financial impact, and instead focus on the\
    \ consumption of indirect\n   resources, have been known to label spam \"Internet\
    \ Pollution\".\n   The Internet provides a tremendous opportunity for businesses,\
    \ both\n   large and small.  There is certainly money to be made using the 'Net\n\
    \   as a resource.  This paper recommends practices and ways to use the\n   Internet\
    \ in manners which are not parasitic; which will not, by their\n   mere existence,\
    \ engender predetermined opposition, litigation, or\n   other negative conditions.\
    \  This paper does not guarantee freedom\n   from those, or other negative responses\
    \ - rather, it provides the\n   reader with a framework through which the marketer/advertiser\
    \ and the\n   'Net community (and more importantly, the seller's target market)\
    \ can\n   coexist as well as possible.\n"
- title: 2. Image and Perception of the Advertiser
  contents:
  - "2. Image and Perception of the Advertiser\n   While it may appear to be financially\
    \ attractive to advertise via the\n   use of Mass-Messaging (\"spam\"), as a responsible\
    \ Internet user,\n   ADVERTISERS SHOULD AVOID THIS OPTION.  The possibility of\
    \ income\n   generation and market or business expansion are minuscule when\n\
    \   compared to some of the risks:\n        -   The alienation of the vast majority\
    \ of the recipients\n            of an advertising message [2][3]\n        - \
    \  The damage or loss of credibility in the advertisers\n            market [2]\n\
    \        -   Loss in advertiser's and/or seller's Internet\n            connectivity\
    \ (most service providers have strict\n            \"zero tolerance\" policies\
    \ which prohibit the use\n            of their systems for the sending of spam,\
    \ or\n            for encouraging or enabling such activities)\n        -   Civil\
    \ and Criminal litigation.  In the United States,\n            (and progressively\
    \ in other sovereign states), it has\n            become accepted as fact that\
    \ the theft-of-service\n            associated with spamming often constitutes\
    \ an\n            unlawful use of private property and is actionable\n       \
    \     as trespass to chattels (a civil law term\n            tantamount to \"\
    theft\") in civil court [4][5][6][7]\n            [8].\n   It is a fundamental\
    \ tenet to any Internet presence that a party will\n   be responsible for their\
    \ Internet \"image\", or the personae that they\n   create.  If an advertiser\
    \ sells a product which is enjoyed by many,\n   and the advertiser has not alienated,\
    \ offended or angered a\n   disproportionately larger number of uninterested recipients,\
    \ that\n   advertiser could be viewed as a hero.  Conversely, an advertiser\n\
    \   broadcasting their product to millions of uninterested parties, at\n   the\
    \ parties' cost, will earn the advertiser the moniker of \"spammer\",\n   thief,\
    \ or other less attractive names.  The advertiser will be held\n   responsible\
    \ for those actions, and the effects those actions have in\n   the marketplace,\
    \ which is to say, the 'Net community.\n   \"On the Internet, nobody knows you're\
    \ a dog.\" [9]  That was the\n   caption to an illustration published in the 1990's.\
    \  The message is\n   clear - the Internet renders all parties anonymous.  The\
    \ methods used\n   to sell products in the traditional sales channels - language,\
    \ image,\n   relationships, eye contact or body language - no longer apply when\n\
    \   measuring an Internet sale.  Reputation, reliability, honesty,\n   trustworthiness,\
    \ and integrity have taken the place of the more\n   direct sales approaches that\
    \ have been previously used.  These are\n   dictated by the rate at which both\
    \ information and misinformation\n   travel on the Internet.  And, just as an\
    \ Internet user cannot control\n   what messages are sent to them, neither can\
    \ the Internet marketer\n   control the information that is disseminated about\
    \ them, or their\n   activities.  Some information will circulate that is not\
    \ accurate.\n   Perhaps there will be cases where there will be information\n\
    \   circulating which is downright incorrect.  But, a successful market\n   reputation,\
    \ based on ethical behavior, will render the inevitable\n   piece of misinformation\
    \ meaningless.  For an advertiser to exist\n   responsibly on the Internet is\
    \ for the advertiser and seller to take\n   active responsibility for their actions.\n"
- title: 3. Collateral Damage
  contents:
  - "3. Collateral Damage\n   As this paper has pointed out, there is ample reason\
    \ to expect that\n   the sending of spam will result in a significant level of\
    \ undesirable\n   reactions, targeted at the advertiser and/or the seller.  Death\n\
    \   threats, litigation and retaliatory actions are commonplace.  For\n   these\
    \ reasons, \"spammers\" (and in particular, those entities\n   providing mass-mailing\
    \ services for third-party businesses) will\n   frequently take steps to ensure\
    \ their anonymity.  These actions take\n   various forms, and have been known\
    \ to include:\n        -   Forging the sender name, domain name, or IP Address\n\
    \            of the sender (called \"spoofing\")\n        -   Sending messages\
    \ through any type of hardware, software\n            or system which belongs\
    \ to an uninvolved third-party\n            (called \"relaying\")\n   Each of\
    \ these activities, as well as numerous others, are criminal\n   acts in many\
    \ countries.  It is unethical to use the resources of any\n   other party without\
    \ their express permission. To do so breaches the\n   laws of numerous jurisdictions\
    \ and international agreements -\n   offenders have been successfully prosecuted\
    \ in numerous\n   jurisdictions.\n"
- title: 4. Caveat Mercator
  contents:
  - "4. Caveat Mercator\n   \"Let the Seller beware.\"  Advertisers and Sellers can\
    \ be held\n   responsible for the appropriateness (or lack thereof) of the messages\n\
    \   they send when applied to the recipients to whom the advertisements\n   are\
    \ sent.  For this reason, all prospective advertisers must first be\n   absolutely\
    \ certain that the recipients of their advertising are\n   appropriate.  For example,\
    \ sending an advertisement which contains a\n   link to a website where content\
    \ of an overt sexual nature is\n   displayed can have many undesirable consequences:\n\
    \        -   In many countries, providing such material to under-\n          \
    \  age minors is a crime.  As the provider of the link,\n            the advertiser's\
    \ position is tenuous.\n        -   In some countries, such material is a crime\
    \ to view,\n            possess, or distribute (\"trafficking\").  As the website\n\
    \            owner or advertiser, a party engaging in such activities\n      \
    \      must consider the ramifications of international law.\n   To prevent such\
    \ risk, advertisers should qualify the recipients of\n   their advertising.  However,\
    \ it must be noted that E-Mail addresses\n   provide little useful information\
    \ to that end.  Remember, \"On the\n   Internet, nobody knows you're a dog.\"\
    \  Advertisers will have no way\n   to qualify a prospective recipient as an adult\
    \ with complete\n   discretionary and plenipotentiary authority.  In other words,\
    \ an\n   advertisement targeting a high-income population in need of property\n\
    \   investment opportunities may be sent to a group of school children.\n   Or\
    \ a dog.\n   How then, does the prospective advertiser/seller determine the\n\
    \   quality of their leads?  The essential requirement is that the\n   advertiser\
    \ \"know\" their audience.\n   As with all sales leads, the ones which are developed\
    \ and generated\n   by the advertiser who will use them are of the most value.\
    \  There is\n   an inherent value to collecting the data first-hand; by collecting\n\
    \   the data directly from the prospective recipient, the advertiser can\n   accomplish\
    \ two important goals:\n        -   The advertiser ensures that the recipient\
    \ is genuinely\n            interested in receiving information.  Thus, the advertiser\n\
    \            can protect themselves from the negative impact of sending\n    \
    \        Unsolicited E-Mail (\"spam\").\n        -   The advertiser maintains\
    \ the ability to \"pre-qualify\" the\n            lead.  One interested lead is\
    \ worth more, from a sales and\n            marketing perspective, than millions\
    \ of actively\n            uninterested potential recipients.\n   If an advertiser\
    \ maintains an active website or uses other mass-\n   marketing tools (such as\
    \ direct-mail), and they are interested in\n   pursuing Internet Advertising,\
    \ the advertiser can add a mechanism to\n   gather sales lead data in a relatively\
    \ simple manner.  From the\n   perspective of Responsible Use, the only such mechanism\
    \ to be\n   discussed in this text will be the \"Opt-In\" concept, to be discussed\n\
    \   in detail later in this document.\n   Regardless of the manner in which the\
    \ information is gathered, there\n   are certain steps which the advertiser must\
    \ follow.  The advertiser\n   must inform the person that data is being collected.\
    \  In addition,\n   the reason why the information is being collected must be\
    \ clearly\n   stated.  BE AWARE!  There are jurisdictions which restrict the\n\
    \   collection of Personal Data.  The laws addressing collection and\n   future\
    \ handling of Personal Information will vary from place to\n   place; advertisers\
    \ must take steps to gain an understanding of those\n   laws.\n   Prudence should\
    \ be the advertiser's guide.  If an advertiser is\n   unsure as to the applicability\
    \ or legality of an action, both in the\n   jurisdiction of the advertiser as\
    \ well as that of the recipients, the\n   action must be avoided entirely.  Advertisers\
    \ would be well advised\n   to realize that, if they engage in spamming, they\
    \ will inevitably\n   break the laws of some jurisdiction, somewhere.\n"
- title: 5. Targeting the Audience
  contents:
  - "5. Targeting the Audience\n   Advertisers have something to sell.  It may be\
    \ a product, service, or\n   other tangible or intangible item.  And, of course,\
    \ the advertiser\n   needs to get the word out to the market - quickly.  After\
    \ all,\n   neither the seller or the advertiser are making sales and earning\n\
    \   profits if nobody is buying the product.  However, before advertisers\n  \
    \ can advertise the product, they must first determine to WHOM the\n   product\
    \ will be advertised.\n   There are considerations in determining the answer to\
    \ that question.\n   This text has already addressed how the sending of Unsolicited\n\
    \   Commercial E-Mail (\"spam\") can generate a number of negative effects.\n\
    \   In addition, numerous surveys cited herein show that the vast\n   majority\
    \ of publicly-available mailing lists and Netnews groups\n   similarly abhor spam.\
    \  The advertiser's first step should always be\n   to determine which avenues\
    \ are appropriate for advertising.  Then,\n   advertisers must determine which\
    \ avenues are appropriate for EACH\n   SPECIFIC ADVERTISEMENT.  Advertisers are\
    \ faced with the task of\n   determining which Netnews groups accept ads, then\
    \ of those, which\n   groups are of a topic to which the proposed advertising\
    \ is relevant.\n   Similarly, the same work should be done for mailing lists.\n\
    \   Advertisers should take some level of comfort in the fact that there\n   *are*\
    \ Netnews groups and mailing lists which welcome advertising -\n   finding them\
    \ is a worthwhile investment of the advertiser's time and\n   resources.\n   For\
    \ assistance in locating such advertising-friendly websites,\n   mailing lists,\
    \ and Netnews groups, advertisers can consult existing\n   ethical and responsible\
    \ Internet advertisers.  Alternatively, any\n   low- or no-cost research resource\
    \ or search engine can be employed to\n   find those groups and lists.  BUT UNDER\
    \ NO CIRCUMSTANCES SHOULD AN\n   ADVERTISER PURCHASE A MAILING LIST AND START\
    \ MAILING!  There are\n   other reasons which will be addressed further into this\
    \ document, but\n   to engage in such activity opens the advertiser to the liabilities\n\
    \   and negative ramifications previously stated.  Such negative\n   conditions\
    \ cause increased costs to the seller/advertiser, when the\n   risks (loss of\
    \ connectivity, defense against litigation, avoiding\n   discovery, etc...) are\
    \ factored into an advertiser's overall\n   operation.  In short, it is in the\
    \ best interests of the seller and\n   advertiser to ensure that the proper audience\
    \ is targeted, prior to\n   any further steps.\n"
- title: 6. Reaching the audience
  contents:
  - "6. Reaching the audience\n   Once the prospective advertiser has determined a\
    \ target market for a\n   specific advertisement, a manner of advertising must\
    \ be selected.\n   While these are too numerous to mention, this document concerns\n\
    \   itself only with those that apply to the ethical use of Internet\n   resources.\
    \  Of those, the pertinent ones to be examined (in order of\n   desirability and\
    \ effectiveness) are:\n        -   A dedicated website or web page\n        -\
    \   Advertisement placed on a \"shared\" advertising site\n            (placing\
    \ an advertisement on an established web-page\n            which caters to people\
    \ that indicate a potential\n            for interest in (a) specific type(s)\
    \ of product(s).\n            Such advertisements can take the form of text, links,\n\
    \            \"Click-Through Banners\", or other.\n        -   Netnews posting\n\
    \        -   Targeted E-Mail messages\n   Note that any manner of blind broadcast\
    \ (distribution-based)\n   advertising which does not involve the targeting of\
    \ the recipients is\n   not considered responsible.\n   Once the advertiser has\
    \ determined the medium for reaching their\n   target audience, there are key\
    \ points to be considered, each being\n   specific to the medium of advertisement:\n\
    \   A.   Dedicated website or web page\n        Advertisers have the option of\
    \ creating a dedicated website, or\n        a page within another site for their\
    \ advertisement.  If, from a\n        technical standpoint, an advertiser is unsure\
    \ of the process for\n        creating such a website, there are numerous resources\
    \ available\n        to provide assistance.  From no-cost avenues such as\n  \
    \      instructional websites; to low-cost resources such as books,\n        videotapes\
    \ or classes; to full-service businesses and\n        consultants who can advise\
    \ advertisers throughout the entire\n        scope of the website/web page design,\
    \ implementation and hosting\n        process (or any part thereof), there is\
    \ a solution available\n        for every type of site and cost-structure.\n \
    \  B.   \"Shared\" Advertising website\n        Advertisers have the option of\
    \ placing their advertisements on\n        a website operated by a third-party.\
    \  For advertisers with an\n        immediate need, such sites (also called \"\
    Electronic Malls\",\n        \"E-Shops\" or other names) have several advantages.\
    \  In some\n        cases, a shared site can be more cost-efficient than building\n\
    \        a dedicated website.  Many sites will target a specific market\n    \
    \    (refer to Section 5 of this document).  By using existing\n        resources,\
    \ advertisers can avoid the cost and burden of\n        owning their own site.\
    \  Many websites will target a specific\n        advertisement to a specific audience,\
    \ thus providing much of\n        the research for the prospective advertiser,\
    \ and providing\n        the advertiser the means with which to reach the most\
    \ receptive\n        audience.  Additionally, advertisements from such advertising\n\
    \        sites can be integrated into a larger context, such as\n        supporting\
    \ free e-mail services, Internet access, or news\n        broadcasts.  Such integration\
    \ can lend a level of credibility\n        to an advertising effort that might\
    \ not exist otherwise.\n        Some notes on the use of any type of website for\
    \ advertising:\n        Regardless of what method an advertiser chooses to use\
    \ for\n        for advertising on the Web, there are some specific caveats\n \
    \       regarding customer interactions:\n             First, the advertiser must\
    \ ensure that their contact\n             information - name, phone, e-mail address\
    \ - are all clear\n             and available;\n             Second, advertisers\
    \ should take care in creating forms\n             which gather information about\
    \ customers, as there is\n             concern in the United States and other\
    \ countries about\n             gathering information from minors without parental\
    \ consent.\n             There is also concern about grabbing dynamic information\n\
    \             via persistent state information, such as through the use\n    \
    \         of \"cookies\" or through data collection software resident\n      \
    \       on the user's computer without their knowledge.\n             Information\
    \ should only ever be gathered in a voluntary and\n             informed fashion,\
    \ as opposed to the use of cookies, forms,\n             or other methods that\
    \ may be available;\n             Third, if advertisers DO gather information\
    \ about people\n             and plan to use it for marketing in ANY way, advertisers\n\
    \             must be VERY clear to specify their plans as people\n          \
    \   submit their information.\n   C.   Netnews and E-Mailing list group postings\n\
    \        If an advertiser has selected newsgroups as a targeted medium,\n    \
    \    there are critical preliminary determinations to be made.  The\n        accepted\
    \ presumption should be that a Netnews group will not\n        welcome spam, although\
    \ there are newsgroups which are\n        advertising-friendly.  However, the\
    \ only way to determine\n        whether a group welcomes a particular type or\
    \ form of\n        advertising is to either:\n             -   read the Frequently\
    \ Asked Questions (FAQ) to determine\n                 what is specifically permitted\
    \ or prohibited on that\n                 particular group.\n                \
    \ or\n             -   ask the group by posting a message which briefly\n    \
    \             notes how you intend to advertise your product.  Do not\n      \
    \           mention any product details in this message, merely ask\n        \
    \         if the group would object.\n                 or\n             -   if\
    \ it is a \"moderated\" newsgroup, send an e-mail to\n                 the group's\
    \ moderator.  Many group moderators will have\n                 a specific preference\
    \ for how to deal with advertising,\n                 through compilation, \"\
    digest\" formats, or other.\n        It is a recommendation that prospective advertisers\
    \ read the\n        groups to which they choose to post for a period before posting.\n\
    \        Generally, an extended period of reading the messages in the\n      \
    \  group will give the advertiser an indication as to how their\n        advertisement\
    \ will be viewed or accepted on the group in\n        question.\n        However,\
    \ this period of reading should not be used as a\n        substitute for the suggestions\
    \ above.  Many groups will have\n        specific instructions and/or requirements\
    \ for posting\n        advertisements.  Advertisers who fail to meet those\n \
    \       requirements will be undertaking irresponsible behavior,\n        and\
    \ will be subject to the effects thereof.\n   D.   Compiled E-Mail Lists\n   \
    \     It bears repeating at this point: Let the Seller Beware.  The\n        material\
    \ discussed in Section 4 of this document is\n        particularly relevant in\
    \ the consideration of E-mail, and\n        the use of compiled lists of e-mail\
    \ addresses for advertising.\n        Advertisers should understand that they\
    \ bear the responsibility\n        for ensuring the proper targeting of their\
    \ recipients; the\n        proper display of their or their seller's identities;\
    \ and the\n        use of resources or systems only with the express permission\n\
    \        of the owners of those systems.\n        When faced with the task of\
    \ collecting and compiling recipient\n        information, one option that is\
    \ frequently presented is that of\n        pre-compiled mailing lists.  Most often,\
    \ these are advertised\n        using the very method which is irresponsible,\
    \ that of\n        Unsolicited E-Mail.  There are numerous reasons why these lists\n\
    \        should not be used.\n        Many suppliers create mailing lists from\
    \ addresses which they\n        have gathered in mildly to extremely unethical\
    \ ways.  Many of\n        these list-makers rely on grabbing volumes of addresses\
    \ without\n        checking their legitimacy.  In other words, they send out\n\
    \        software robots to grab addresses they find in News or Mailing\n    \
    \    List archives which may be many years old!  In addition, many\n        list\
    \ owners create addresses using a \"dictionary\", creating\n        vast numbers\
    \ of invalid addresses which are then sold to\n        unsuspecting purchasers.\
    \  People change jobs, change ISPs,\n        and change everything about themselves\
    \ over time; trusting\n        a third party for a mailing list is just not wise.\n\
    \        It is known that some mailing list providers have created\n        mailing\
    \ lists from E-mail addresses of people who have asked to\n        be REMOVED\
    \ from their mailing lists.  They then sell these lists\n        to other advertisers\
    \ who think they're getting a list of people\n        who will welcome the unsolicited\
    \ information.\n        Regardless of the source, however, advertisers and sellers\
    \ bear\n        the responsibility for maintenance of their lists.  Purchasing\
    \ a\n        list from a third-party shifts the maintenance costs of that\n  \
    \      list onto the advertiser who uses it.  Needless to say, this is\n     \
    \   only economical for mailing list vendor.\n        Given these conditions,\
    \ all evidence points to the fact that\n        the greatest level of control\
    \ of an advertiser's own success\n        and liability rests with the advertiser\
    \ themselves.  This being\n        the case, advertisers are faced with the task\
    \ of compiling their\n        own lists of willing recipients of Advertising-related\
    \ E-Mail\n        messages.  As discussed previously, those leads which are\n\
    \        generated by the advertiser are the most likely to have an\n        interest\
    \ in the advertisement, so they are also the least likely\n        to protest\
    \ the receipt of such advertisements via E-Mail.  It\n        is this circumstance\
    \ that makes the use of an \"Opt-In\" list\n        (refer to Section 7 of this\
    \ text) to be perhaps the most\n        successful method of advertising distribution\
    \ on the Internet.\n        It must be noted here - for the same reasons that\
    \ apply above,\n        if an advertiser has compiled their own mailing list for\
    \ their\n        purposes, that list must NEVER be sold to another party.  Just\n\
    \        as it is considered unethical to purchase a third-party mailing\n   \
    \     list, it is equally so to be the provider of that list.\n        Customers\
    \ who wish to receive information about your product\n        are not likely to\
    \ respond favorably when contacted in an\n        unsolicited fashion by your\
    \ business associates; protect your\n        reputation from the backlash of bad-faith\
    \ that can occur in\n        such cases.\n"

  - "7. Opt-In Mailing Lists\n   This document has laid out the basic facts of Internet\
    \ Marketing; the\n   advertiser bears the responsibility of their actions; there\
    \ will\n   always be recipients of that advertising who do not wish to receive\n\
    \   it; there are reactions to every responsible and irresponsible act.\n   Given\
    \ these considerations, and taking into account the central\n   message of this\
    \ document; that Internet Advertising *can* be a\n   successful venture for everyone\
    \ involved; there remains a key tool\n   for the Internet advertiser to harness.\
    \  Opt-In mailing lists provide\n   the prospective Internet advertiser with the\
    \ control they need over\n   the list of their prospective target audience (validity\
    \ of e-mail\n   address; applicability to the intended product; willingness to\n\
    \   receive advertising via e-mail).\n   Opt-In mailing lists are consistently\
    \ shown to be more effective in\n   starting and maintaining customer relationships\
    \ than any other type\n   of Internet advertising; studies have shown Opt-In mailing\
    \ to be\n   Eighteen (18%) Percent more effective than Banner advertising [10],\n\
    \   which has a response rate of only 0.65%.  It is so successful because\n  \
    \ the recipients of those E-mailed advertisements made a specific\n   effort to\
    \ receive them, thus indicating their interest in receiving\n   information about\
    \ products which the recipient felt were of interest\n   to themselves.\n   Advertisers\
    \ wishing to employ Opt-In mailing lists in their\n   advertising can turn to\
    \ several resources for assistance.  If an\n   advertiser operates their own website\
    \ or web page, they already\n   possess the most important facet, a web presence\
    \ with which to invite\n   participation in the Opt-In list.  If the advertiser\
    \ chooses to use a\n   shared website for their product, they can also utilize\
    \ an Opt-In\n   data gathering mechanism.  There are numerous forms and technologies\n\
    \   that can be employed to build an Opt-In list - this document will not\n  \
    \ address them individually.  Rather, the purpose of this section is to\n   provide\
    \ the advertiser with information which, when used, will help\n   protect the\
    \ advertiser, and make the advertising experience a\n   successful one.\n   A.\
    \ Privacy\n      As stated previously, advertisers should take care in\n     \
    \ gathering information from Opt-In participants.  First and\n      foremost,\
    \ the person providing the information must be aware\n      that they are doing\
    \ so.  By taking these preliminary steps,\n      an advertiser decreases the risk\
    \ of having any messages\n      interpreted as spam.  If, in submitting information\
    \ for any\n      purpose, the advertiser intends to use the submitted or\n   \
    \   inferred data for any mailings, there should be clear\n      language indicating\
    \ so.  Furthermore, persons submitting data\n      must be given the choice to\
    \ \"Opt-Out\"; that is, to choose to\n      submit the data but NOT receive any\
    \ advertisements.  A safe\n      course of action is for the advertiser to configure\
    \ their\n      data-gathering so \"Opt-Out\" is the default; that is, to\n   \
    \   ensure that any members of the list have made a concerted\n      effort to\
    \ get onto said list.  In nearly all cases, merely\n      having a \"check-box\"\
    \ available with the caption\n         \"Please send me E-Mail advertisements\
    \ or\n          announcements about your products.\"\n      is sufficient.\n \
    \     It is crucial that advertisers be aware that different\n      jurisdictions\
    \ deal with the collection of personal data\n      differently - the burden of\
    \ verification of these laws rests\n      on the advertisers.  For additional\
    \ information on privacy,\n      refer to Appendix B of this document.\n   B.\
    \ Integrity\n      When maintaining a list where names can be submitted via some\n\
    \      type of public or semi-public resource, such as a website,\n      advertisers\
    \ should take steps to verify every subscription to\n      that list.  There are\
    \ key pieces of data that can be used to\n      verify the integrity of a particular\
    \ subscription request,\n      but the only person who can attest to the genuineness\
    \ of the\n      actual act of subscribing is the owner of the E-Mail address\n\
    \      which has been submitted.\n      To protect themselves from the risk of\
    \ inadvertently spamming\n      an unsuspecting recipient, advertisers should\
    \ immediately\n      confirm any submission.  In doing so, advertisers can satisfy\n\
    \      all requirements for responsible confirmation of a subscription\n     \
    \ request.  In addition, if a person's E-Mail address has been\n      submitted\
    \ to a list without the knowledge or permission of the\n      owner of that E-mail\
    \ address, immediate notification of that,\n      and the receipt of supporting\
    \ data, enables the owner of that\n      account to act accordingly to protect\
    \ their account from future\n      wrongdoing.\n      When generating confirmations,\
    \ the following information must\n      be provided to the subscriber:\n     \
    \    -     the E-Mail address subscribed\n         -     the manner in which it\
    \ was subscribed\n               (website or mailing list address)\n         -\
    \     the Date and Time of the subscription request\n               (via NTP,\
    \ for uniformity in future reference)\n         -     the IP Address of the host\
    \ which submitted\n               the request\n         -     the full headers\
    \ of the subscription request\n               (where applicable, such as mailing\
    \ lists)\n         -     the Name, website address, and contact E-Mail\n     \
    \          address of the advertiser\n         -     instructions to the recipient\
    \ as to how to\n               permanently remove themselves from the list\n \
    \     In addition, a well-represented business will make an effort\n      to communicate\
    \ this material in a way which the average\n      recipient can understand and\
    \ relate to, such as the following\n      example [11]:\n        - - - - - - C\

    \ measures they can take\n      to protect themselves.  Frequently, and especially\
    \ when the\n      traffic on a particular mailing list is low, a subscriber may\n\
    \      forget that they had requested membership on that list.  When a\n     \
    \ new message is sent and subsequently received, said recipient\n      may lodge\
    \ a complaint of spamming.  If this situation is\n      multiplied by several\
    \ recipients, the advertiser and/or seller\n      risks losing their Internet\
    \ access, even if they have acted\n      responsibly throughout the process.\n\
    \      For this reason, advertisers should keep an archive of all\n      submission\
    \ requests which are received.  This archive should be\n      kept as diligently\
    \ as the advertiser's operational data, and\n      should be similarly safeguarded.\
    \  Having such requests available\n      will protect the advertisers from any\
    \ reports of spamming,\n      whether they are malicious, or the result of a genuine\n\
    \      misunderstanding.  For reasons that should be obvious, those\n      messages\
    \ should remain archived for a period that lasts AT\n      LEAST as long as the\
    \ list remains active.  While this is not\n      necessarily a requirement for\
    \ responsible behavior, it is a\n      measure of safety for the responsible advertiser.\n"

- title: A.1  The classic Pyramid
  contents:
  - "A.1  The classic Pyramid\n   In the classic Pyramid scheme, there is a list of\
    \ a few people.  A\n   participant sends money to one or all of them, and then\
    \ shifts that\n   person off the list and adds their own name.  The participant\
    \ then\n   sends the same message to N people....\n   The idea is that when a\
    \ recipient's name gets to the special place on\n   the list (usually at the \"\
    top\" of the pyramid), they will get lots of\n   money.  The problem is that this\
    \ only works for everyone if there are\n   an infinite number of people available.\n\
    \   As an example, examine a message with a list of four people where\n   each\
    \ participant sends US$5.00 to each; removes the first name, and\n   adds their\
    \ own name at the bottom.  There may also be some content\n   encouraging the\
    \ participants to send \"reports\" to people who submit\n   money.  Presume the\
    \ rules encourage the participants to send out lots\n   of copies until they each\
    \ get ten direct responses, 100 second level\n   responses, etc., and claim there\
    \ is a guarantee that the participants\n   will earn lots of money fast if they\
    \ follow the procedure.\n   First, some person or group has to have started this.\
    \  When they did,\n   they were able to specify all four names so it was probably\
    \ four\n   people working together to split any profits they might get from\n\
    \   being the top of the pyramid (or maybe they sent out four versions of\n  \
    \ the original letter with their name order rotated).  In some cases,\n   all\
    \ names on the list have been proven to be the same person,\n   operating under\
    \ assumed business names!\n   While the letters that accompany these things usually\
    \ have all kinds\n   of language about following the instructions exactly, the\
    \ most\n   rational thing for a dishonest participant to do if they decided to\n\
    \   participate in such a thing would be to;\n        (1) send no money to anyone\
    \ else; and\n        (2) find three other people and replace all the names on\n\
    \            the list.\n   But, presume that not just this participant, but everyone\
    \ who ever\n   participates decides to follow the \"rules\".  To avoid the start-up\n\
    \   transient, assume that it starts with one name on the list and for\n   the\
    \ next three layers of people, one name gets added and only after\n   the list\
    \ is up to four does any participant start dropping the \"top\"\n   name.\n  \
    \ What does this look like after nine levels if everything works\n   perfectly?\
    \ The following table shows, for nine levels, how many\n   people have to participate,\
    \ what each person pays out, gets in, and\n   nets.\n      Level         People\
    \       Out          In        Net\n      1                  1         0     $55,550\
    \    $55,550\n      2                 10        $5     $55,550    $55,545\n  \
    \    3                100       $10     $55,550    $55,540\n      4          \
    \    1,000       $15     $55,550    $55,535\n      5             10,000      \
    \ $20     $55,550    $55,530\n      6            100,000       $20      $5,550\
    \     $5,530\n      7          1,000,000       $20        $550       $530\n  \
    \    8         10,000,000       $20         $50        $30\n      9        100,000,000\
    \       $20           0        -20\n   So if this scheme ever progressed this\
    \ far (which is extremely\n   unlikely) over 10,000 people would have made the\
    \ \"guaranteed\"\n   $50,000.  In order to do that, one hundred million people\
    \ (or over\n   ten thousand times as many) are out twenty dollars.  And it can't\n\
    \   continue because the scheme is running out of people.  Level 10 would\n  \
    \ take one billion people, all of whom have $20 to submit, which\n   probably\
    \ don't exist.  Level 11 would take ten billion, more people\n   than exist on\
    \ the earth.\n   Pyramid schemes are _always_ like this.  A few people who start\
    \ them\n   may make money, only because the vast majority lose money.  People\n\
    \   who participate and expect to make any money, except possibly those\n   who\
    \ start it, are being defrauded; for this reason, such schemes are\n   illegal\
    \ in many countries.\n"
- title: A.2  What about Ponzi?
  contents:
  - "A.2  What about Ponzi?\n   A Ponzi scheme is very similar to a pyramid except\
    \ that all of the\n   money goes through a single location.  This method of confidence\n\
    \   fraud is named after Charles Ponzi, a Boston, Massachusetts\n   \"businessman\"\
    \ who claimed to have discovered a way to earn huge\n   returns on money by buying\
    \ international postal reply coupons and\n   redeeming them in postage for more\
    \ than their cost.  Early\n   \"investors\" in this scheme did get their promised\
    \ return on\n   investment, but with money that later investors were investing.\n\
    \   Ponzi was actually doing nothing with the money other than deriving\n   his\
    \ own income from it, and paying latter investors' money to earlier\n   investors.\n\
    \   Notice the similarity to early pyramid participants, who \"earn\" money\n\
    \   from the later participants.\n   Just as pyramids always collapse, Ponzi schemes\
    \ always collapse also,\n   when the new people and new money run out.  This can\
    \ have serious\n   consequences.  People in Albania died and much of that country's\n\
    \   savings were squandered when huge Ponzi schemes that \"seemed\" to be\n  \
    \ partly backed by the government collapsed.\n"
- title: A.3  So all multi-levels are evil?
  contents:
  - "A.3  So all multi-levels are evil?\n   No, all multi-level systems are not the\
    \ same, nor are they all\n   \"evil\".\n   If what is moving around is just money\
    \ and maybe \"reports\" or the\n   like that are very cheap to produce, then almost\
    \ certainly it is a\n   criminal scam.  If there are substantial goods and/or\
    \ services being\n   sold through a networked tier-system at reasonable prices,\
    \ it is more\n   likely to be legitimate.\n   If the advertisement says participants\
    \ can make money \"fast\", \"easy\"\n   or \"guaranteed\", be very suspicious.\
    \  If it says participants may be\n   able to make money by putting in lots of\
    \ hard work over many months\n   but there is no guarantee, then it may be legitimate.\
    \  As always, if\n   it seems \"too good to be true\", it probably is.\n   If\
    \ people are paid to recruit \"members\" or can \"buy\" a high \"level\",\n  \
    \ it is almost certainly a criminal scam.  If people are paid only for\n   the\
    \ sale of substantial goods and/or services, it is more likely to\n   be legitimate.\n\
    \   It may also be worthwhile to look at the history of the organization\n   and\
    \ its founders/leaders.  The longer it has been around, the more\n   likely it\
    \ is to continue being around.  If its founders or leaders\n   have a history\
    \ of fraud or crime, a person should think very\n   carefully before being part\
    \ of it.\n"
- title: B.1   Why Web Privacy?
  contents:
  - "B.1   Why Web Privacy?\n   Directories, lists or other collection sources of\
    \ personal data are\n   the current informational \"gold rush\" for Internet Marketers.\
    \  In the\n   United States and other countries, there is no explicit guarantee\
    \ of\n   personal privacy.  Such a right, under current legislation, stands\n\
    \   little chance against certain electronic technologies.  Some members\n   of\
    \ the global community have expressed concern regarding perceived\n   intrusion\
    \ into their personal privacy.  Still, the collection and\n   sale of such information\
    \ abounds.\n   Self-regulation by businesses utilizing the Internet is the first\n\
    \   choice of legislators, commercial websites, and Internet aficionados.\n  \
    \ However, the anticipated profit to be made by selling personal data\n   and\
    \ by using these lists for advertisement purposes, often dissuades\n   self-regulation.\n\
    \   United States Senator Patrick Leahy, Ranking Minority member of the\n   Judiciary\
    \ Committee of the United States Senate (at the time of the\n   writing of this\
    \ document) states very succinctly why we should\n   respect Internet Privacy:\n\
    \      \"Good privacy policies make good business policies.  New\n      technologies\
    \ bring with them new opportunities, both for\n      the businesses that develop\
    \ and market them, and for\n      consumers.  It does not do anyone any good for\
    \ consumers\n      to hesitate to use any particular technology because they\n\
    \      have concerns over privacy.  That is why I believe that\n      good privacy\
    \ policies make good business policies.\"\n   The Center for Democracy and Technology\
    \ suggests Five Conditions that\n   websites should use to be considerate of individual's\
    \ rights to\n   privacy:\n        -   Notice of Data Collection\n        -   Choice\
    \ to Opt Out\n        -   Access to Data to rectify errors\n        -   Adequate\
    \ Security of Information Database\n        -   Access to contact persons representing\
    \ the data collector\n   Notice that the practice of data collection authorization\
    \ can be\n   accomplished using something as simple as an automated response E-\n\
    \   Mail message.  Such notices should contain easily understood\n   information\
    \ about the collecting party's identity, and instructions\n   as to how a customer\
    \ can remove themselves from the collected\n   population.  This will help assure\
    \ prospective customers that an\n   advertiser is a business of integrity.\n \
    \  Businesses that pursue international trade (do business across\n   national\
    \ boundaries, overseas, etc...) bear the risk of facing legal\n   prosecution\
    \ for personal privacy violations.  The European\n   Communities have legislation\
    \ for the flow of Personal Information.\n   If an advertiser is interested in\
    \ pursuing business interests across\n   borders, and particularly if a business\
    \ intends to solicit and/or\n   share Personal Information, the advertiser/seller\
    \ must be able to\n   guarantee the same privacy considerations as a foreign counterpart,\n\
    \   or as a business operating in the nation in which the advertiser is\n   soliciting/performing\
    \ their business.\n   Other countries and their legislation are shown below:\n\
    \   Germany     -     BundesDatenSchutzGesetz (BDSG)\n   France      -     Commision\
    \ nationale de l'informatique et de\n                     libertes (CNIL)\n  \
