    \ MPLS from\n   supporting packet (Packet Switching Capable, or PSC) interfaces\
    \ and\n   switching to include support of four new classes of interfaces and\n\
    \   switching: Layer-2 Switch Capable (L2SC), Time-Division Multiplex\n   (TDM),\
    \ Lambda Switch Capable (LSC) and Fiber-Switch Capable (FSC).  A\n   functional\
    \ description of the extensions to MPLS signaling needed to\n   support the new\

  - "2.  SONET and SDH Traffic Parameters\n   This section defines the GMPLS traffic\
    \ parameters for SONET/SDH.  The\n   protocol-specific formats, for the SONET/SDH-specific\
    \ RSVP-TE objects\n   and CR-LDP TLVs, are described in Sections 2.2 and 2.3,\
    \ respectively.\n   These traffic parameters specify a base set of capabilities\
    \ for SONET\n   ANSI [T1.105] and SDH ITU-T [G.707], such as concatenation and\n\
    \   transparency.  Other documents may further enhance this set of\n   capabilities\
    \ in the future.  For instance, signaling for SDH over PDH\n   ITU-T G.832 or\
    \ sub-STM-0 ITU-T G.708 interfaces could be defined.\n   The traffic parameters\
    \ defined hereafter (see Section 2.1) MUST be\n   used when the label is encoded\
    \ as SUKLM as defined in this memo (see\n   Section 3).  They MUST also be used\
    \ when requesting one of Section/RS\n   or Line/MS overhead transparent STS-1/STM-0,\
    \ STS-3*N/STM-N (N=1, 4,\n   16, 64, 256) signals.\n   The traffic parameters\
    \ and label encoding defined in [RFC3471],\n   Section 3.2, MUST be used for fully\
    \ transparent STS-1/STM-0,\n   STS-3*N/STM-N (N=1, 4, 16, 64, 256) signal requests.\
    \  A fully\n   transparent signal is one for which all overhead is left unmodified\n\
    \   by intermediate nodes; i.e., when all defined Transparency (T) bits\n   would\
    \ be set if the traffic parameters defined in Section 2.1 were\n   used.\n"

    \   Annex 1 lists examples of SONET and SDH signal coding.\n   o) Signal Type\
    \ (ST): 8 bits\n   This field indicates the type of Elementary Signal that constitutes\n\
    \   the requested Label Switched Path (LSP).  Several transforms can be\n   applied\
    \ successively on the Elementary Signal to build the Final\n   Signal actually\
    \ being requested for the LSP.\n   Each transform application is optional and\
    \ must be ignored if zero,\n   except the Multiplier (MT), which cannot be zero\
    \ and is ignored if\n   equal to one.\n   Transforms must be applied strictly\
    \ in the following order:\n   - First, contiguous concatenation (by using the\
    \ RCC and NCC fields)\n     can be optionally applied on the Elementary Signal,\
    \ resulting in a\n     contiguously concatenated signal.\n   - Second, virtual\
    \ concatenation (by using the NVC field) can be\n     optionally applied on the\
    \ Elementary Signal, resulting in a\n     virtually concatenated signal.\n   -\
    \ Third, some transparency (by using the Transparency field) can be\n     optionally\
    \ specified when a frame is requested as signal rather\n     than an SPE- or VC-based\
    \ signal.\n   - Fourth, a multiplication (by using the Multiplier field) can be\n\
    \     optionally applied directly on the Elementary Signal, on the\n     contiguously\
    \ concatenated signal obtained from the first phase, on\n     the virtually concatenated\
    \ signal obtained from the second phase,\n     or on these signals combined with\
    \ some transparency.\n   Permitted Signal Type values for SONET/SDH are\n   Value\

    \ (only when transparency is requested)\n   A dedicated signal type is assigned\
    \ to a SONET STS-3c SPE instead of\n   being coded as a contiguous concatenation\
    \ of three STS-1 SPEs.  This\n   is done in order to provide easy interworking\
    \ between SONET and SDH\n   signaling.\n   Appendix 1 adds one signal type (optional)\
    \ to the above values.\n   o) Requested Contiguous Concatenation (RCC): 8 bits\n\
    \   This field is used to request the optional SONET/SDH contiguous\n   concatenation\
    \ of the Elementary Signal.\n   This field is a vector of flags.  Each flag indicates\
    \ the support of\n   a particular type of contiguous concatenation.  Several flags\
    \ can be\n   set at the same time to indicate a choice.\n   These flags allow\
    \ an upstream node to indicate to a downstream node\n   the different types of\
    \ contiguous concatenation that it supports.\n   However, the downstream node\
    \ decides which one to use according to\n   its own rules.\n   A downstream node\
    \ receiving simultaneously more than one flag chooses\n   a particular type of\
    \ contiguous concatenation, if any is supported,\n   and according to criteria\
    \ that are out of this document's scope.  A\n   downstream node that doesn't support\
    \ any of the concatenation types\n   indicated by the field must refuse the LSP\
    \ request.  In particular,\n   it must refuse the LSP request if it doesn't support\
    \ contiguous\n   concatenation at all.\n   When several flags have been set, the\
    \ upstream node retrieves the\n   (single) type of contiguous concatenation the\
    \ downstream node has\n   selected by looking at the position indicated by the\
    \ first label and\n   the number of labels as returned by the downstream node\
    \ (see also\n   Section 3).\n   The entire field is set to zero to indicate that\
    \ no contiguous\n   concatenation is requested at all (default value).  A non-zero\
    \ field\n   indicates that some contiguous concatenation is requested.\n   The\
    \ following flag is defined:\n      Flag 1 (bit 1): Standard contiguous concatenation.\n\
    \   Flag 1 indicates that the standard SONET/SDH contiguous\n   concatenation,\
    \ as defined in [T1.105]/[G.707], is supported.  Note\n   that bit 1 is the low-order\
    \ bit.  Other flags are reserved for\n   extensions; if not used, they must be\
    \ set to zero when sent and\n   should be ignored when received.\n   See note\
    \ 1 in the section on the NCC about the SONET contiguous\n   concatenation of\
    \ STS-1 SPEs when the number of components is a\n   multiple of three.\n   o)\
    \ Number of Contiguous Components (NCC): 16 bits\n   This field indicates the\
    \ number of identical SONET SPEs/SDH VCs\n   (i.e., Elementary Signal) that are\
    \ requested to be concatenated, as\n   specified in the RCC field.\n   Note 1:\
    \ When a SONET STS-Nc SPE with N=3*X is requested, the\n   Elementary Signal to\
    \ be used must always be an STS-3c_SPE signal\n   type, and the value of NCC must\
    \ always be equal to X.  This allows\n   facilitating the interworking between\
    \ SONET and SDH.  In particular,\n   it means that the contiguous concatenation\
    \ of three STS-1 SPEs cannot\n   be requested, as according to this specification\
    \ this type of signal\n   must be coded using the STS-3c SPE signal type.\n  \
    \ Note 2: When a transparent STS-N/STM-N signal is requested that is\n   limited\
    \ to a single contiguously concatenated STS-Nc_SPE/VC-4-Nc, the\n   signal type\
    \ must be STS-N/STM-N, RCC with flag 1, NCC set to 1.\n   The NCC value must be\
    \ consistent with the type of contiguous\n   concatenation being requested in\
    \ the RCC field.  In particular, this\n   field is irrelevant if no contiguous\
    \ concatenation is requested (RCC\n   = 0).  In that case, it must be set to zero\
    \ when sent and should be\n   ignored when received.  A RCC value different from\
    \ 0 implies a number\n   of contiguous components greater than or equal to 1.\n\
    \   Note 3: Following these rules, when a VC-4 signal is requested, the\n   RCC\
    \ and the NCC values SHOULD be set to 0, whereas for an STS-3c SPE\n   signal,\
    \ the RCC and the NCC values SHOULD be set 1.  However, if\n   local conditions\
    \ allow, since the setting of the RCC and NCC values\n   is locally driven, the\
    \ requesting upstream node MAY set the RCC and\n   NCC values to either SDH or\
    \ SONET settings without impacting the\n   function.  Moreover, the downstream\
    \ node SHOULD accept the requested\n   values if local conditions allow.  If these\
    \ values cannot be\n   supported, the receiver downstream node SHOULD generate\
    \ a\n   PathErr/NOTIFICATION message (see Sections 2.2 and 2.3,\n   respectively).\n\
    \   o) Number of Virtual Components (NVC): 16 bits\n   This field indicates the\
    \ number of signals that are requested to be\n   virtually concatenated.  These\
    \ signals are all of the same type by\n   definition.  They are Elementary Signal\
    \ SPEs/VCs for which signal\n   types are defined in this document; i.e., VT1.5_SPE/VC-11,\n\
    \   VT2_SPE/VC-12, VT3_SPE, VT6_SPE/VC-2, STS-1_SPE/VC-3, or\n   STS-3c_SPE/VC-4.\n\
    \   This field is set to 0 (default value) to indicate that no virtual\n   concatenation\
    \ is requested.\n   o) Multiplier (MT): 16 bits\n   This field indicates the number\
    \ of identical signals that are\n   requested for the LSP; i.e., that form the\
    \ Final Signal.  These\n   signals can be identical Elementary Signals, identical\
    \ contiguously\n   concatenated signals, or identical virtually concatenated signals.\n\
    \   Note that all of these signals thus belong to the same LSP.\n   The distinction\
    \ between the components of multiple virtually\n   concatenated signals is done\
    \ via the order of the labels that are\n   specified in the signaling.  The first\
    \ set of labels must describe\n   the first component (set of individual signals\
    \ belonging to the first\n   virtual concatenated signal), the second set must\
    \ describe the second\n   component (set of individual signals belonging to the\
    \ second virtual\n   concatenated signal), and so on.\n   This field is set to\
    \ one (default value) to indicate that exactly one\n   instance of a signal is\
    \ being requested.  Intermediate and egress\n   nodes MUST verify that the node\
    \ itself and the interfaces on which\n   the LSP will be established can support\
    \ the requested multiplier\n   value.  If the requested values cannot be supported,\
    \ the receiver\n   node MUST generate a PathErr/NOTIFICATION message (see Sections\
    \ 2.2\n   and 2.3, respectively).\n   Zero is an invalid value.  If a zero is\
    \ received, the node MUST\n   generate a PathErr/NOTIFICATION message (see Sections\
    \ 2.2 and 2.3,\n   respectively).\n   Note 1: When a transparent STS-N/STM-N signal\
    \ is requested that is\n   limited to a single contiguously concatenated STS-Nc-SPE/VC-4-Nc,\
    \ the\n   multiplier field MUST be equal to 1 (only valid value).\n   o) Transparency\
    \ (T): 32 bits\n   This field is a vector of flags that indicates the type of\n\
    \   transparency being requested.  Several flags can be combined to\n   provide\
    \ different types of transparency.  Not all combinations are\n   necessarily valid.\
    \  The default value for this field is zero, i.e.,\n   no transparency is requested.\n\
    \   Transparency, as defined from the point of view of this signaling\n   specification,\
    \ is only applicable to the fields in the SONET/SDH\n   frame overheads.  In the\
    \ SONET case, these are the fields in the\n   Section Overhead (SOH) and the Line\
    \ Overhead (LOH).  In the SDH case,\n   these are the fields in the Regenerator\
    \ Section Overhead (RSOH), the\n   Multiplex Section overhead (MSOH), and the\
    \ pointer fields between the\n   two.  With SONET, the pointer fields are part\
    \ of the LOH.\n   Note also that transparency is only applicable when the following\n\
    \   signal types are used: STS-1/STM-0, STS-3/STM-1, STS-12/STM-4,\n   STS-48/STM-16,\
    \ STS-192/STM-64, and STS-768/STM-256.  At least one\n   transparency type must\
    \ be specified when such a signal type is\n   requested.\n   Transparency indicates\
    \ precisely which fields in these overheads must\n   be delivered unmodified at\
    \ the other end of the LSP.  An ingress\n   Label Switching Router (LSR) requesting\
    \ transparency will pass these\n   overhead fields that must be delivered to the\
    \ egress LSR without any\n   change.  From the ingress and egress LSRs point of\
    \ views, these\n   fields must be seen as being unmodified.\n   Transparency is\
    \ applied not at the interfaces with the initiating and\n   terminating LSRs but\
    \ only between intermediate LSRs.  The\n   transparency field is used to request\
    \ an LSP that supports the\n   requested transparency type; it may also be used\
    \ to set up the\n   transparency process to be applied at each intermediate LSR.\n\
    \   The different transparency flags are as follows:\n      Flag 1 (bit 1): Section/Regenerator\
    \ Section layer\n      Flag 2 (bit 2): Line/Multiplex Section layer\n   where\
    \ bit 1 is the low-order bit.  Other flags are reserved; they\n   should be set\
    \ to zero when sent and ignored when received.  A flag is\n   set to one to indicate\
    \ that the corresponding transparency is\n   requested.\n   Intermediate and egress\
    \ nodes MUST verify that the node itself and\n   the interfaces on which the LSP\
    \ will be established can support the\n   requested transparency.  If the requested\
    \ flags cannot be supported,\n   the receiver node MUST generate a PathErr/NOTIFICATION\
    \ message (see\n   Sections 2.2 and 2.3, respectively).\n   Section/Regenerator\
    \ Section layer transparency means that the entire\n   frames must be delivered\
    \ unmodified.  This implies that pointers\n   cannot be adjusted.  When Section/Regenerator\
    \ Section layer\n   transparency is used all other flags MUST be ignored.\n  \
    \ Line/Multiplex Section layer transparency means that the LOH/MSOH\n   must be\
    \ delivered unmodified.  This implies that pointers cannot be\n   adjusted.\n\
    \   o) Profile (P): 32 bits\n   This field is intended to indicate particular\
    \ capabilities that must\n   be supported for the LSP; for example, monitoring\
    \ capabilities.\n   No standard profile is currently defined, and this field SHOULD\
    \ be\n   set to zero when transmitted and ignored when received.\n   In the future,\
    \ TLV-based extensions may be created.\n"

- title: 3.  SONET and SDH Labels
  contents:
  - "3.  SONET and SDH Labels\n   SONET and SDH each define a multiplexing structure.\
    \  Both structures\n   are trees whose roots are, respectively, an STS-N or an\
    \ STM-N and\n   whose leaves are the signals that can be transported via the time-\n\
    \   slots and switched between time-slots within an ingress port and\n   time-slots\
    \ within an egress port; i.e., a VTx SPE, an STS-x SPE, or a\n   VC-x.  A SONET/SDH\
    \ label will identify the exact position (i.e.,\n   first time-slot) of a particular\
    \ VTx SPE, STS-x SPE, or VC-x signal\n   in a multiplexing structure.  SONET and\
    \ SDH labels are carried in the\n   Generalized Label per [RFC3473] and [RFC3472].\n\
    \   Note that by time-slots we mean the time-slots as they appear\n   logically\
    \ and sequentially in the multiplex, not as they appear after\n   any possible\
    \ interleaving.\n   These multiplexing structures will be used as naming trees\
    \ to create\n   unique multiplex entry names or labels.  The same format of label\
    \ is\n   used for SONET and SDH.  As explained in [RFC3471], a label does not\n\
    \   identify the \"class\" to which the label belongs.  This is implicitly\n \
    \  determined by the link on which the label is used.\n   In case of signal concatenation\
    \ or multiplication, a list of labels\n   can appear in the Label field of a Generalized\
    \ Label.\n   In case of contiguous concatenation, only one label appears in the\n\
    \   Label field.  This unique label is encoded as a single 32-bit label\n   value\
    \ (as defined in this section) of the Generalized Label object\n   (Class-Num\
    \ = 16, C-Type = 2)/TLV (0x0825).  This label identifies the\n   lowest time-slot\
    \ occupied by the contiguously concatenated signal.\n   By lowest time-slot, we\
    \ mean the one having the lowest label (value)\n   when compared as an integer\
    \ value; i.e., the time-slot occupied by\n   the first component signal of the\
    \ concatenated signal encountered\n   descending the tree.\n   In case of virtual\
    \ concatenation, the explicit ordered list of all\n   labels in the concatenation\
    \ is given.  This ordered list of labels is\n   encoded as a sequence of 32-bit\
    \ label values (as defined in this\n   section) of the Generalized Label object\
    \ (Class-Num = 16, C-Type =\n   2)/TLV (0x0825).  Each label indicates the first\
    \ time-slot occupied\n   by a component of the virtually concatenated signal.\
    \  The order of\n   the labels must reflect the order of the payloads to concatenate\
    \ (not\n   the physical order of time-slots).  The above representation limits\n\
    \   virtual concatenation to remain within a single (component) link; it\n   imposes,\
    \ as such, a restriction compared to the ANSI [T1.105]/ ITU-T\n   [G.707] recommendations.\
    \  The standard definition for virtual\n   concatenation allows each virtual concatenation\
    \ components to travel\n   over diverse paths.  Within GMPLS, virtual concatenation\
    \ components\n   must travel over the same (component) link if they are part of\
    \ the\n   same LSP.  This is due to the way that labels are bound to a\n   (component)\
    \ link.  Note, however, that the routing of components on\n   different paths\
    \ is indeed equivalent to establishing different LSPs,\n   each one having its\
    \ own route.  Several LSPs can be initiated and\n   terminated between the same\
    \ nodes, and their corresponding components\n   can then be associated together\
    \ (i.e., virtually concatenated).\n   In case of multiplication (i.e., using the\
    \ multiplier transform), the\n   explicit ordered list of all labels that take\
    \ part in the Final\n   Signal is given.  This ordered list of labels is encoded\
    \ as a\n   sequence of 32-bit label values (as defined in this section) of the\n\
    \   Generalized Label object (Class-Num = 16, C-Type = 2)/TLV (0x0825).\n   In\
    \ case of multiplication of virtually concatenated signals, the\n   explicit ordered\
    \ list of the set of labels that take part in the\n   Final Signal is given. \
    \ The first set of labels indicates the time-\n   slots occupied by the first\
    \ virtually concatenated signal, the second\n   set of labels indicates the time-slots\
    \ occupied by the second\n   virtually concatenated signal, and so on.  The above\
    \ representation\n   limits multiplication to remain within a single (component)\
    \ link.\n   The format of the label for SONET and/or SDH TDM-LSR link is\n   \
    \ 0                   1                   2                   3\n    0 1 2 3 4\
    \ 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1\n   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+\n\
    \   |               S               |   U   |   K   |   L   |   M   |\n   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+\n\
    \   This is an extension of the numbering scheme defined in [G.707],\n   Sections\
    \ 7.3.7 through 7.3.13; i.e., the (K, L, M) numbering.  Note\n   that the higher\
    \ order numbering scheme defined in [G.707], Sections\n   7.3.1 through 7.3.6,\
    \ is not used here.\n   Each letter indicates a possible branch number starting\
    \ at the parent\n   node in the multiplex structure.  Branches are considered\
    \ as being\n   numbered in increasing order, starting from the top of the\n  \
    \ multiplexing structure.  The numbering starts at 1; zero is used to\n   indicate\
    \ a non-significant or ignored field.\n   When a field is not significant or ignored\
    \ in a particular context,\n   it MUST be set to zero when transmitted and ignored\
    \ when received.\n   When a hierarchy of SONET/SDH LSPs is used, a higher-order\
    \ LSP with a\n   given bandwidth can be used to carry lower-order LSPs.  Remember\
    \ that\n   a higher-order LSP is established through a SONET/SDH higher-order\n\
    \   path layer network, and a lower-order LSP through a SONET/SDH lower-\n   order\
    \ path layer network (see also ITU-T G.803, Section 3, for the\n   corresponding\
    \ definitions).  In this context, the higher-order\n   SONET/SDH LSP behaves as\
    \ a \"virtual link\" with a given bandwidth\n   (e.g., VC-3); it may also be used\
    \ as a Forwarding Adjacency.  A\n   lower-order SONET/SDH LSP can be established\
    \ through that higher-\n   order LSP.  Since a label is local to a (virtual) link,\
    \ the highest\n   part of that label (i.e., the S, U, and K fields) is non-significant\n\
    \   and is set to zero; i.e., the label is \"0,0,0,L,M\".  Similarly, if\n   the\
    \ structure of the lower-order LSP is unknown or not relevant, the\n   lowest\
    \ part of that label (i.e., the L and M fields) is non-\n   significant and is\
    \ set to zero; i.e., the label is \"S,U,K,0,0\".\n   For instance, a VC-3 LSP\
    \ can be used to carry lower-order LSPs.  In\n   that case, the labels allocated\
    \ between the two ends of the VC-3 LSP\n   for the lower-order LSPs will have\
    \ S, U, and K set to zero (i.e.,\n   non-significant) while L and M will be used\
    \ to indicate the signal\n   allocated in that VC-3.\n   In case of tunneling,\
    \ such as VC-4 containing VC-3 containing\n   VC-12/VC-11, where the SUKLM structure\
    \ is not adequate to represent\n   the full signal structure, a hierarchical approach\
    \ must be used;\n   i.e., per layer network signaling.\n   The possible values\
    \ of S, U, K, L, and M are defined as follows:\n   1.  S=1->N is the index of\
    \ a particular STS-3/AUG-1 inside an\n       STS-N/STM-N multiplex.  S is only\
    \ significant for SONET STS-N\n       (N>1) and SDH STM-N (N>0).  S must be 0\
    \ and ignored for STS-1 and\n       STM-0.\n   2.  U=1->3 is the index of a particular\
    \ STS-1_SPE/VC-3 within an\n       STS-3/AUG-1.  U is only significant for SONET\
    \ STS-N (N>1) and SDH\n       STM-N (N>0).  U must be 0 and ignored for STS-1\
    \ and STM-0.\n   3.  K=1->3 is the index of a particular TUG-3 within a VC-4.\
    \  K is\n       only significant for an SDH VC-4 structured in TUG-3s.  K must\
    \ be\n       0 and ignored in all other cases.\n   4.  L=1->7 is the index of\
    \ a particular VT_Group/TUG-2 within an\n       STS-1_SPE/TUG-3 or VC-3.  L must\
    \ be 0 and ignored in all other\n       cases.\n   5.  M is the index of a particular\
    \ VT1.5_SPE/VC-11, VT2_SPE/VC-12, or\n       VT3_SPE within a VT_Group/TUG-2.\
    \  M=1->2 indicates a specific VT3\n       SPE inside the corresponding VT Group;\
    \ these values MUST NOT be\n       used for SDH, since there is no equivalent\
    \ of VT3 with SDH.\n       M=3->5 indicates a specific VT2_SPE/VC-12 inside the\n\
    \       corresponding VT_Group/TUG-2.  M=6->9 indicates a specific\n       VT1.5_SPE/VC-11\
    \ inside the corresponding VT_Group/TUG-2.\n   Note that a label always has to\
    \ be interpreted according the\n   SONET/SDH traffic parameters; i.e., a label\
    \ by itself does not allow\n   knowing which signal is being requested (a label\
    \ is context\n   sensitive).\n   The label format defined in this section, referred\
    \ to as SUKLM, MUST\n   be used for any SONET/SDH signal requests that are not\
    \ transparent;\n   i.e., when all Transparency (T) bits defined in Section 2.1\
    \ are set\n   to zero.  Any transparent STS-1/STM-0/STS-3*N/STM-N (N=1, 4, 16,\
    \ 64,\n   256) signal request MUST use a label format as defined in [RFC3471].\n\

    \    4th VT1.5 SPE\n   Examples of Labels\n   Example 1: the label for the STS-3c_SPE/VC-4\
    \ in the Sth\n              STS-3/AUG-1 is: S>0, U=0, K=0, L=0, M=0.\n   Example\
    \ 2: the label for the VC-3 within the Kth-1 TUG-3 within\n              the VC-4\
    \ in the Sth AUG-1 is: S>0, U=0, K>0, L=0, M=0.\n   Example 3: the label for the\
    \ Uth-1 STS-1_SPE/VC-3 within the Sth\n              STS-3/AUG-1 is: S>0, U>0,\
    \ K=0, L=0, M=0.\n   Example 4: the label for the VT6/VC-2 in the Lth-1 VT Group/TUG-2\n\
    \              in the Uth-1 STS-1_SPE/VC-3 within the Sth STS-3/AUG-1\n      \
    \        is: S>0, U>0, K=0, L>0, M=0.\n   Example 5: the label for the 3rd VT1.5_SPE/VC-11\
    \ in the Lth-1 VT\n              Group/TUG-2 within the Uth-1 STS-1_SPE/VC-3 within\
    \ the\n              Sth STS-3/AUG-1 is: S>0, U>0, K=0, L>0, M=8.\n   Example\
    \ 6: the label for the STS-12c SPE/VC-4-4c which uses the\n              9th STS-3/AUG-1\
    \ as its first timeslot is: S=9, U=0,\n              K=0, L=0, M=0.\n   In case\
    \ of contiguous concatenation, the label that is used is the\n   lowest label\
    \ (value) of the contiguously concatenated signal, as\n   explained before.  The\
    \ higher part of the label indicates where the\n   signal starts, and the lowest\
    \ part is not significant.\n   In case of STM-0/STS-1, the values of S, U, and\
    \ K must be equal to\n   zero, according to the field coding rules.  For instance,\
    \ when a VC-3\n   in an STM-0 is requested, the label is S=0, U=0, K=0, L=0, M=0.\
    \  When\n   a VC-11 in a VC-3 in an STM-0 is requested, the label is S=0, U=0,\n\
    \   K=0, L>0, M=6..9.\n   Note: when a Section/RS or Line/MS transparent STS-1/STM-0/\n\
    \   STS-3*N/STM-N (N=1, 4, 16, 64, 256) signal is requested, the SUKLM\n   label\
    \ format and encoding is not applicable, and the label encoding\n   MUST follow\
    \ the rules defined in [RFC3471], Section 3.2.\n"

- title: Appendix 1.  Signal Type Values Extension for VC-3
  contents:
  - "Appendix 1.  Signal Type Values Extension for VC-3\n   This appendix defines\
    \ the following optional additional Signal\n   Type value for the Signal Type\
    \ field of Section 2.1:\n   Value         Type\n   -----  ---------------------\n\
    \    20     \"VC-3 via AU-3 at the end\"\n   According to the ITU-T [G.707] recommendation,\
    \ a VC-3 in the TU-\n   3/TUG-3/VC-4/AU-4 branch of the SDH multiplex cannot be\
    \ structured in\n   TUG-2s; however, a VC-3 in the AU-3 branch can be.  In addition,\
    \ a\n   VC-3 could be switched between the two branches, if required.\n   A VC-3\
    \ circuit could be terminated on an ingress interface of an LSR\n   (e.g., forming\
    \ a VC-3 forwarding adjacency).  This LSR could then\n   want to demultiplex this\
    \ VC-3 and switch internal low-order LSPs.\n   For implementation reasons, this\
    \ could be only possible if the LSR\n   receives the VC-3 in the AU-3 branch.\
    \  For example, for an LSR not\n   able to switch internally from a TU-3 branch\
    \ to an AU-3 branch on its\n   incoming interface before demultiplexing and then\
    \ switching the\n   content with its switch fabric.\n   In that case, it is useful\
    \ to indicate that the VC-3 LSP must be\n   terminated at the end in the AU-3\
    \ branch instead of the TU-3 branch.\n   This is achieved by using the \"VC-3\
    \ via AU-3 at the end\" signal type.\n   This information can be used, for instance,\
    \ by the penultimate LSR to\n   switch an incoming VC-3 received in any branch\
    \ to the AU-3 branch on\n   the outgoing interface to the destination LSR.\n \
    \  The \"VC-3 via AU-3 at the end\" signal type does not imply that the\n   VC-3\
    \ must be switched via the AU-3 branch at some other places in the\n   network.\
    \  The VC-3 signal type just indicates that a VC-3 in any\n   branch is suitable.\n"

  - "Annex 1.  Examples\n   This annex defines examples of SONET and SDH signal coding.\
    \  The\n   objective is to help the reader to understand how the traffic\n   parameter\
    \ coding works and not to give examples of typical SONET or\n   SDH signals.\n\
    \   As stated above, signal types are Elementary Signals to which\n   successive\
    \ concatenation, multiplication, and transparency transforms\n   can be applied\
    \ to obtain Final Signals.\n   1.   A VC-4 signal is formed by the application\
    \ of RCC with value 0,\n        NCC with value 0, NVC with value 0, MT with value\
    \ 1, and T with\n        value 0 to a VC-4 Elementary Signal.\n   2.   A VC-4-7v\
    \ signal is formed by the application of RCC with value\n        0, NCC with value\
    \ 0, NVC with value 7 (virtual concatenation of\n        7 components), MT with\
    \ value 1, and T with value 0 to a VC-4\n        Elementary Signal.\n   3.   A\
    \ VC-4-16c signal is formed by the application of RCC with value\n        1 (standard\
    \ contiguous concatenation), NCC with value 16, NVC\n        with value 0, MT\
    \ with value 1, and T with value 0 to a VC-4\n        Elementary Signal.\n   4.\
    \   An STM-16 signal with Multiplex Section layer transparency is\n        formed\
    \ by the application of RCC with value 0, NCC with value 0,\n        NVC with\
    \ value 0, MT with value 1, and T with flag 2 to an\n        STM-16 Elementary\
    \ Signal.\n   5.   An STM-4 signal with Multiplex Section layer transparency is\n\
    \        formed by the application of RCC with value 0, NCC with value 0,\n  \
    \      NVC with value 0, MT with value 1, and T with flag 2 applied to\n     \
    \   an STM-4 Elementary Signal.\n   6.   An STM-256 signal with Multiplex Section\
    \ layer transparency is\n        formed by the application of RCC with value 0,\
    \ NCC with value 0,\n        NVC with value 0, MT with value 1, and T with flag\
    \ 2 applied to\n        an STM-256 Elementary Signal.\n   7.   An STS-1 SPE signal\
    \ is formed by the application of RCC with\n        value 0, NCC with value 0,\
    \ NVC with value 0, MT with value 1,\n        and T with value 0 to an STS-1 SPE\
    \ Elementary Signal.\n   8.   An STS-3c SPE signal is formed by the application\
    \ of RCC with\n        value 1 (standard contiguous concatenation), NCC with value\
    \ 1,\n        NVC with value 0, MT with value 1, and T with value 0 to an\n  \
    \      STS-3c SPE Elementary Signal.\n   9.   An STS-48c SPE signal is formed\
    \ by the application of RCC with\n        value 1 (standard contiguous concatenation),\
    \ NCC with value 16,\n        NVC with value 0, MT with value 1, and T with value\
    \ 0 to an\n        STS-3c SPE Elementary Signal.\n   10.  An STS-1-3v SPE signal\
    \ is formed by the application of RCC with\n        value 0, NVC with value 3\
    \ (virtual concatenation of 3\n        components), MT with value 1, and T with\
    \ value 0 to an STS-1 SPE\n        Elementary Signal.\n   11.  An STS-3c-9v SPE\
    \ signal is formed by the application of RCC with\n        value 1, NCC with value\
    \ 1, NVC with value 9 (virtual\n        concatenation of 9 STS-3c), MT with value\
    \ 1, and T with value 0\n        to an STS-3c SPE Elementary Signal.\n   12. \
    \ An STS-12 signal with Section layer (full) transparency is\n        formed by\
    \ the application of RCC with value 0, NCC with value 0,\n        NVC with value\
    \ 0, MT with value 1, and T with flag 1 to an\n        STS-12 Elementary Signal.\n\
    \   13.  A 3 x STS-768c SPE signal is formed by the application of RCC\n     \
    \   with value 1, NCC with value 256, NVC with value 0, MT with\n        value\
    \ 3, and T with value 0 to an STS-3c SPE Elementary Signal.\n   14.  A 5 x VC-4-13v\
    \ composed signal is formed by the application of\n        RCC with value 0, NVC\
