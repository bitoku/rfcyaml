  - "Abstract\n   The Secure Sockets Layer version 3.0 (SSLv3), as specified in RFC\n
    \  6101, is not sufficiently secure.  This document requires that SSLv3\n   not
    be used.  The replacement versions, in particular, Transport\n   Layer Security
    (TLS) 1.2 (RFC 5246), are considerably more secure and\n   capable protocols.\n
    \  This document updates the backward compatibility section of RFC 5246\n   and
    its predecessors to prohibit fallback to SSLv3.\n"

  - "1.  Introduction\n   Since it was released in 1996, the SSLv3 protocol [RFC6101]
    has been\n   subject to a long series of attacks, both on its key exchange\n   mechanism
    and on the encryption schemes it supports.  Despite being\n   replaced by TLS
    1.0 [RFC2246] in 1999, and subsequently TLS 1.1 in\n   2002 [RFC4346] and 1.2
    in 2006 [RFC5246], availability of these\n   replacement versions has not been
    universal.  As a result, many\n   implementations of TLS have permitted the negotiation
    of SSLv3.\n   The predecessor of SSLv3, SSL version 2, is no longer considered\n
    \  sufficiently secure [RFC6176].  SSLv3 now follows.\n"

    \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\"
    in this\n   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].\n"
  title: 2.  Terminology
- contents:
  - "3.  Do Not Use SSL Version 3.0\n   SSLv3 MUST NOT be used.  Negotiation of SSLv3
    from any version of TLS\n   MUST NOT be permitted.\n   Any version of TLS is more
    secure than SSLv3, though the highest\n   version available is preferable.\n   Pragmatically,
    clients MUST NOT send a ClientHello with\n   ClientHello.client_version set to
    {03,00}.  Similarly, servers MUST\n   NOT send a ServerHello with ServerHello.server_version
    set to\n   {03,00}.  Any party receiving a Hello message with the protocol\n   version
    set to {03,00} MUST respond with a \"protocol_version\" alert\n   message and
    close the connection.\n   Historically, TLS specifications were not clear on what
    the record\n   layer version number (TLSPlaintext.version) could contain when\n
    \  sending ClientHello.  Appendix E of [RFC5246] notes that\n   TLSPlaintext.version
    could be selected to maximize interoperability,\n   though no definitive value
    is identified as ideal.  That guidance is\n   still applicable; therefore, TLS
    servers MUST accept any value\n   {03,XX} (including {03,00}) as the record layer
    version number for\n   ClientHello, but they MUST NOT negotiate SSLv3.\n"

    - "4.1.  Record Layer\n   The non-deterministic padding used in the Cipher Block
      Chaining (CBC)\n   construction of SSLv3 trivially permits the recovery of plaintext\n
      \  [POODLE].  More generally, the CBC modes of SSLv3 use a flawed MAC-\n   then-encrypt
      construction that has subsequently been replaced in TLS\n   versions [RFC7366].
      \ Unfortunately, the mechanism to correct this\n   flaw relies on extensions:
      a feature added in TLS 1.0.  SSLv3 cannot\n   be updated to correct this flaw
      in the same way.\n   The flaws in the CBC modes in SSLv3 are mirrored by the
      weakness of\n   the stream ciphers it defines.  Of those defined, only RC4 is\n
      \  currently in widespread use.  RC4, however, exhibits serious biases\n   and
      is also no longer fit for use [RFC7465].\n   This leaves SSLv3 with no suitable
      record protection mechanism.\n"
    title: 4.1.  Record Layer
  - contents:
    - "4.2.  Key Exchange\n   The SSLv3 key exchange is vulnerable to man-in-the-middle
      attacks\n   when renegotiation [RFC5746] or session resumption [TRIPLE-HS] are\n
      \  used.  Each flaw has been fixed in TLS by means of extensions.\n   Again,
      SSLv3 cannot be updated to correct these flaws.\n"
    title: 4.2.  Key Exchange
  - contents:
    - "4.3.  Custom Cryptographic Primitives\n   SSLv3 defines custom constructions
      for Pseudorandom Function (PRF),\n   Hashed Message Authentication Code (HMAC),
      and digital signature\n   primitives.  Such constructions lack the deep cryptographic
      scrutiny\n   that standard constructions used by TLS have received.  Furthermore,\n
      \  all SSLv3 primitives rely on SHA-1 [RFC3174] and MD5 [RFC1321]: these\n   hash
      algorithms are considered weak and are being systematically\n   replaced with
      stronger hash functions, such as SHA-256 [FIPS180-4].\n"

  - "5.  Limited Capabilities\n   SSLv3 is unable to take advantage of the many features
    that have been\n   added to recent TLS versions.  This includes the features that
    are\n   enabled by ClientHello extensions, which SSLv3 does not support.\n   Though
    SSLv3 can benefit from new cipher suites, it cannot benefit\n   from new cryptographic
    modes and features.  Of these, the following\n   are particularly prominent:\n
    \  o  Authenticated Encryption with Additional Data (AEAD) modes are\n      added
    in [RFC5246].\n   o  Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) and Digital Signature\n
    \     Algorithm (ECDSA) are added in [RFC4492].\n   o  Stateless session tickets
    [RFC5077].\n   o  A datagram mode of operation, DTLS [RFC6347].\n   o  Application-layer
    protocol negotiation [RFC7301].\n"
