  - "1.  Introduction\n   Atom [RFC4287] is an XML-based document format that describes
    lists\n   of related information known as \"feeds\".  Feeds are composed of a\n
    \  number of items known as \"entries\", each with an extensible set of\n   attached
    metadata.  The primary use case that Atom addresses is the\n   syndication of
    Web content, such as weblogs and news headlines to Web\n   sites as well as directly
    to user agents.\n   In the base Atom format, when an entry is removed from a feed
    but a\n   consumer has already received and processed that entry, perhaps\n   adding
    it to a local cache or display, there is no mechanism for\n   determining that
    the entry has been removed.  This specification adds\n   a mechanism to the Atom
    Syndication Format that publishers of Atom\n   Feed and Entry documents can use
    to explicitly identify Atom entries\n   that have been removed.  Atom consumers
    can use that information to\n   adjust such things as their document cache and
    user interfaces.\n"

    \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\",
    and \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].\n
    \  This specification uses XML Namespaces [W3C.REC-xml-names-19990114]\n   to
    uniquely identify XML element names.  It uses the following\n   namespace prefix
    for the indicated namespace URI:\n    \"at\": \"http://purl.org/atompub/tombstones/1.0\"\n"
  title: 2.  Notational Conventions

  - "3.  The at:deleted-entry Element\n   The at:deleted-entry element represents
    an Atom Entry that has been\n   removed.\n     deletedEntry =\n       element
    at:deleted-entry {\n         atomCommonAttributes,\n         attribute ref { atomUri
    },\n         attribute when { atomDateConstruct },\n         ( element at:by {
    atomPersonConstruct }?\n         & element at:comment { atomTextConstruct }?\n
    \        & element atom:link { atomLink }*\n         & element atom:source { atomSource
    }?\n         & anyElement* )\n      }\n   The at:deleted-entry element MUST contain
    a \"ref\" attribute whose\n   value specifies the value of the atom:id of the
    entry that has been\n   removed.\n   The at:deleted-entry element MUST contain
    a \"when\" attribute whose\n   value is an [RFC3339] \"date-time\", specifying
    the instant the entry\n   was removed.  An uppercase \"T\" character MUST be used
    to separate\n   date and time, and an uppercase \"Z\" character MUST be present
    in the\n   absence of a numeric time zone offset.\n   The at:deleted-entry element
    MAY contain one at:by element used to\n   identify the entity that removed the
    entry.  The at:by element is an\n   Atom Person Construct as defined by Section
    3.2 of [RFC4287].\n   The at:deleted-entry element MAY contain one at:comment
    element whose\n   value provides additional, language-sensitive information about
    the\n   deletion operation.  The atom:comment element is an Atom Text\n   Construct
    as defined by Section 3.1 of [RFC4287].\n   The at:deleted-entry element MAY contain
    any number of atom:link\n   elements as specified by Section 4.2.7 of [RFC4287].\n
    \  The at:deleted-entry element MAY contain one atom:source element as\n   defined
    by Section 4.2.11 of [RFC4287].  Within the context of an at:\n   deleted-entry
    element, the atom:source element is intended to allow\n   the aggregation of at:deleted-entry
    elements from different feeds\n   while retaining information about an at:deleted-entry's
    source Feed.\n   When an at:deleted-entry element appears in a Feed document other\n
    \  than its source feed or when an at:deleted-entry element that has a\n   source
    Feed document is used in the context of a Deleted Entry\n   Document, it MUST
    contain an atom:source element.\n   An Atom feed MAY contain any number of at:deleted-entry
    elements, but\n   MUST NOT contain more than one with the same combination of
    ref and\n   when attribute values.\n     <feed xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom\"\n
    \          xmlns:at=\"http://purl.org/atompub/tombstones/1.0\">\n        ...\n
    \       <!-- Minimal deleted-entry -->\n        <at:deleted-entry\n          ref=\"tag:example.org,2005:/entries/1\"\n
    \         when=\"2005-11-29T12:11:12Z\"/>\n        <!-- Extended deleted-entry
    -->\n        <at:deleted-entry\n          ref=\"tag:example.org,2005:/entries/2\"\n
    \         when=\"2005-11-29T12:11:12Z\">\n          <at:by>\n            <name>John
    Doe</name>\n            <email>jdoe@example.org</email>\n          </at:by>\n
    \         <at:comment>Removed comment spam</at:comment>\n        </at:deleted-entry>\n
    \       ...\n     </feed>\n   An Atom feed MAY contain atom:entry elements and
    at:deleted-entry\n   elements sharing the same atom:id value.  In such cases,
    the\n   implication is that the particular atom:entry has either been\n   published
    to the feed and then subsequently removed, or that a\n   previously removed entry
    has been republished to the feed following a\n   previous deletion.  To determine
    which condition applies, the\n   Processor needs to compare the value of the at:deleted-entry\n
    \  element's when attribute to the value of the corresponding atom:entry\n   element's
    atom:updated value:\n   o  If the when attribute specifies a value equal to or
    more recent\n      than that specified by the atom:updated element, the atom:entry
    is\n      assumed to have been published and then subsequently removed.\n      Processors
    SHOULD ignore the older atom:entry element.\n   o  If the when attribute specifies
    a value older than that specified\n      by the atom:updated element, the atom:entry
    is assumed to have\n      been republished to the feed following a prior removal.\n
    \     Processors SHOULD ignore the older at:deleted-entry element.\n   Publishers
    of feeds containing at:deleted-entry elements should note\n   that the at:deleted-entry
    element is advisory in nature only, and it\n   may be ignored by Atom Processors.
    \ The presence of an at:deleted-\n   entry element does not guarantee that the
    atom:entry to which it is\n   referring will no longer be available.  For example,
    if an entry was\n   published to a feed document that was published and processed\n
    \  yesterday by an aggregator application, and then is subsequently\n   deleted
    today with a corresponding at:deleted-entry element added to\n   the feed as a
    signal that the entry was deleted, there is no\n   guarantee that the aggregator
    application will pay any attention to\n   the at:deleted-entry element during
    subsequent processing operations.\n   Elements and attributes from any XML vocabulary
    MAY be used within an\n   at:deleted-entry element.  Processors encountering such
    markup MUST\n   NOT stop processing or signal an error.  It might be the case
    that\n   the Processor is able to process the foreign markup correctly and\n   does
    so.  When unknown markup is encountered as a child of at:\n   deleted-entry, Processors
    MAY bypass the markup and any textual\n   content but MUST NOT change their behavior
    as a result of the\n   markup's presence.\n   This specification allows the use
    of Internationalized Resource\n   Identifiers (IRIs) [RFC3987] in precisely the
    same manner specified\n   in Section 2 of [RFC4287].\n   Any element defined by
    this specification MAY have an xml:base\n   attribute [W3C.REC-xmlbase-20010627].
    \ When xml:base is used, it\n   serves the function described in Section 5.1.1
    of [RFC3986],\n   establishing the base URI (or IRI) for resolving any relative\n
    \  references found within the effective scope of the xml:base\n   attribute.\n
    \  Any element defined by this specification MAY have an xml:lang\n   attribute,
    whose content indicates the natural language for the\n   element and its descendents.
    \ Requirements regarding the content and\n   interpretation of xml:lang are specified
    in XML 1.0\n   [W3C.REC-xml-20040204], Section 2.12.\n"

- contents:
  - "4.  Deleted Entry Document\n   A \"Deleted Entry Document\" represents exactly
    one at:deleted-entry\n   element outside the context of an Atom feed.  Its root
    is the at:\n   deleted-entry element.\n   namespace at = \"http://purl.org/atompub/tombstones/1.0\"\n
    \  start = at:deleted-entry\n   Deleted Entry Documents are specified in terms
    of the XML Information\n   Set, serialized as XML 1.0 [W3C.REC-xml-20040204] and
    identified with\n   the \"application/atomdeleted+xml\" media type.  Deleted Entry\n
    \  Documents MUST be well-formed XML.  This specification does not\n   define
    a DTD for Deleted Entry Documents, and hence does not require\n   them to be valid
    (in the sense used by XML).\n"
  title: 4.  Deleted Entry Document
- contents:
  - "5.  Digital Signatures\n   The at:deleted-entry element MAY have an Enveloped
    Signature, as\n   described by XML-Signature and Syntax Processing\n   [W3C.REC-xmldsig-core-20020212].\n
    \  Processors MUST NOT reject an at:deleted-entry containing such a\n   signature
    because they are not capable of verifying it; they MUST\n   continue processing
    and MAY inform the user of their failure to\n   validate the signature.\n   In
    other words, the presence of an element with the namespace URI\n   \"http://www.w3.org/2000/09/xmldsig#\"
    and a local name of \"Signature\"\n   as a child of the document element MUST
    NOT cause a Processor to fail\n   merely because of its presence.\n   Section
    6.5.1 of [W3C.REC-xmldsig-core-20020212] requires support for\n   Canonical XML
    [W3C.REC-xml-c14n-20010315].  However, many\n   implementers do not use it because
    signed XML documents enclosed in\n   other XML documents have their signatures
    broken.  Thus, Processors\n   that verify signed at:deleted-entry elements MUST
    be able to\n   canonicalize with the exclusive XML canonicalization method\n   identified
    by the URI \"http://www.w3.org/2001/10/xml-exc-c14n#\", as\n   specified in Exclusive
    XML Canonicalization\n   [W3C.REC-xml-exc-c14n-20020718].\n   Intermediaries such
    as aggregators may need to add an atom:source\n   element to an at:deleted-entry
    that does not contain its own atom:\n   source element.  If such an entry is signed,
    the addition will break\n   the signature.  Thus, a publisher of individually
    signed at:deleted-\n   entry's should strongly consider adding an atom:source
    element to\n   those elements before signing them.  Implementers should also be\n
    \  aware of the issues concerning the use of markup in the \"xml:\"\n   namespace
    as it interacts with canonicalization.\n   Section 4.4.2 of [W3C.REC-xmldsig-core-20020212]
    requires support for\n   Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA) signatures and recommends
    support\n   for RSA signatures.  However, because of the much greater popularity\n
    \  in the market of RSA versus DSA, Atom Processors that verify signed\n   Atom
    Documents MUST be able to verify RSA signatures; they do not\n   need be able
    to verify DSA signatures.  Due to security issues that\n   can arise if the keying
    material for the message authentication code\n   (MAC) is not handled properly,
    Atom Documents SHOULD NOT use MACs for\n   signatures.\n"
  title: 5.  Digital Signatures
- contents:
  - "6.  Encryption\n   The root of a Deleted Entry Document (the at:deleted-entry
    element)\n   MAY be encrypted using the mechanisms described by XML Encryption\n
    \  Syntax and Processing [W3C.REC-xmlenc-core-20021210].\n   Section 5.1 of [W3C.REC-xmlenc-core-20021210]
    requires support of\n   TripleDES, AES-128, and AES-256.  Processors that decrypt
    Deleted\n   Entry Documents MUST be able to decrypt with AES-128 in Cipher Block\n
    \  Chaining (CBC) mode.\n   Encryption based on [W3C.REC-xmlenc-core-20021210]
    does not ensure\n   integrity of the original document.  There are known cryptographic\n
    \  attacks in which someone who cannot decrypt a message can still\n   change
    bits in a way in which part or all the decrypted message makes\n   sense but has
    a different meaning.  Thus, Processors that decrypt\n   Deleted Entry Documents
    SHOULD check the integrity of the decrypted\n   document by verifying the hash
    in the signature (if any) in the\n   document, or by verifying a hash of the document
    within the document\n   (if any).\n   When a Deleted Entry Document is to be both
    signed and encrypted, it\n   is generally a good idea to first sign the document
    and then encrypt\n   the signed document.  This provides integrity to the base
    document\n   while encrypting all the information, including the identity of the\n
    \  entity that signed the document.  Note that if MACs are used for\n   authentication,
    the order MUST be that the document is signed and\n   then encrypted, and not
    the other way around.  Further, if MACs are\n   used along with a symmetric encryption
    algorithm, the same key SHOULD\n   NOT be used in the generation of the MAC and
    the encryption.\n"
  title: 6.  Encryption
- contents:
  - "7.  Security Considerations\n   As specified in [RFC4287], Atom Processors should
    be aware of the\n   potential for spoofing attacks in which an attacker publishes
    atom:\n   entry or atom:deleted-entry elements using the same atom:id values as\n
    \  entries from other Atom feeds.  An attacker may attempt to trick an\n   application
    into believing that a given entry has either been removed\n   from or added to
    a feed.  To mitigate this issue, Atom Processors are\n   advised to ignore at:deleted-entry
    elements referencing entries that\n   have not previously appeared within the
    containing Feed document and\n   should take steps to verify the origin of the
    Atom feed before\n   considering the entries to be removed.\n   The at:deleted-entry
    element can be encrypted and signed using\n   [W3C.REC-xmlenc-core-20021210] and
    [W3C.REC-xmldsig-core-20020212],\n   respectively, and is subject to the security
    considerations implied\n   by their use.\n   Digital signatures provide authentication
    and message integrity with\n   proof of origin.  Encryption provides data confidentiality.\n
    \  An application supporting the use of digitally signed atom:entry and\n   at:deleted-entry
    elements should be aware of the potential issues\n   that could arise if an at:deleted-entry
    element that indicates the\n   deletion of an atom:entry element has been signed
    using a different\n   key than what was used to sign the atom:entry, or if an
    unsigned at:\n   deleted-entry is used to indicate the deletion of a signed atom:\n
    \  entry.  Either case can potentially indicate a form of spoofing\n   attack.
    \ Processors must take steps to verify the validity of the at:\n   deleted-entry
    element.\n"
