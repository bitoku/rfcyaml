  - "1.  Introduction\n   This specification defines registration procedures for the\
    \ message\n   header field names used by Internet mail, HTTP, newsgroup feeds\
    \ and\n   other Internet applications.  It is not intended to be a replacement\n\
    \   for protocol-specific registries, such as the SIP registry [30].\n   Benefits\
    \ of a central registry for message header field names\n   include:\n   o  providing\
    \ a single point of reference for standardized and\n      widely-used header field\
    \ names;\n   o  providing a central point of discovery for established header\n\
    \      fields, and easy location of their defining documents;\n   o  discouraging\
    \ multiple definitions of a header field name for\n      different purposes;\n\
    \   o  helping those proposing new header fields discern established\n      trends\
    \ and conventions, and avoid names that might be confused\n      with existing\
    \ ones;\n   o  encouraging convergence of header field name usage across multiple\n\
    \      applications and protocols.\n   The primary specification for Internet\
    \ message header fields in email\n   is the Internet mail message format specification,\
    \ RFC 2822 [4].\n   HTTP/1.0 [10] and HTTP/1.1 [24] define message header fields\n\
    \   (respectively, the HTTP-header and message-header protocol elements)\n   for\
    \ use with HTTP.  RFC 1036 [5] defines message header elements for\n   use with\
    \ Netnews feeds.  These specifications also define a number of\n   header fields,\
    \ and provide for extension through the use of new\n   field-names.\n   There\
    \ are many other Internet standards track documents that define\n   additional\
    \ header fields for use within the same namespaces, notably\n   MIME [11] and\
    \ related specifications.  Other Internet applications\n   that use MIME, such\
    \ as SIP (RFC 3261 [30]) may also use many of the\n   same header fields (but\
    \ note that IANA maintains a separate registry\n   of header fields used with\
    \ SIP).\n   Although in principle each application defines its own set of valid\n\
    \   header fields, exchange of messages between applications (e.g., mail\n   to\
    \ Netnews gateways), common use of MIME encapsulation, and the\n   possibility\
    \ of common processing for various message types (e.g., a\n   common message archive\
    \ and retrieval facility) makes it desirable to\n   have a common point of reference\
    \ for standardized and proposed header\n   fields.  Listing header fields together\
    \ reduces the chance of an\n   accidental collision, and helps implementers find\
    \ relevant\n   information.  The message header field registries defined here\
    \ serve\n   that purpose.\n"

- title: 2.1.  Permanent and Provisional Header Fields
  contents:
  - "2.1.  Permanent and Provisional Header Fields\n   Many message header fields\
    \ are defined in standards-track documents,\n   which means they have been subjected\
    \ to a process of community review\n   and achieved consensus that they provide\
    \ a useful and well-founded\n   capability, or represent a widespread use of which\
    \ developers should\n   be aware.  Some are defined for experimental use, typically\n\
    \   indicating consensus regarding their purpose but not necessarily\n   concerning\
    \ their technical details.  Many others have been defined\n   and adopted ad-hoc\
    \ to address a locally occurring requirement; some\n   of these have found widespread\
    \ use.\n   The catalogues defined here are intended to cater for all of these\n\
    \   header fields, while maintaining a clear distinction and status for\n   those\
    \ which have community consensus.  To this end, two repositories\n   are defined:\n\
    \   o  A Permanent Message Header Field Registry, intended for headers\n     \
    \ defined in IETF standards-track documents, those that have\n      achieved a\
    \ comparable level of community review, or are generally\n      recognized to\
    \ be in widespread use.  The assignment policy for\n      such registration is\
    \ \"Specification Required\", as defined by RFC\n      2434 [3], where the specification\
    \ must be published in an RFC\n      (standards-track, experimental, informational\
    \ or historic), or as\n      an \"Open Standard\" in the sense of RFC 2026, section\
    \ 7 [1].\n   o  A Provisional Message Header Field Repository, intended for any\n\
    \      header field proposed by any developer, without making any claim\n    \
    \  about its usefulness or the quality of its definition.  The policy\n      for\
    \ recording these is \"Private Use\", per RFC 2434 [3].\n   Neither repository\
    \ tracks the syntax, semantics or type of field-\n   values.  Only the field-names,\
    \ applicable protocols and status are\n   registered; all other details are specified\
    \ in the defining documents\n   referenced by repository entries.  Significant\
    \ updates to such\n   references (e.g., the replacement of a Proposed Standard\
    \ RFC by a\n   Draft Standard RFC, but not necessarily the revision of an Internet-\n\
    \   draft) SHOULD be accompanied by updates to the corresponding\n   repository\
    \ entries.\n"
- title: 2.2.  Definitions of Message Header Fields
  contents:
  - "2.2.  Definitions of Message Header Fields\n   RFC 2822 [4] defines a general\
    \ syntax for message headers, and also\n   defines a number of fields for use\
    \ with Internet mail.  HTTP/1.0 [10]\n   and HTTP/1.1 [24] do likewise for HTTP.\
    \  Additional field names are\n   defined in a variety of standards-track RFC\
    \ documents, including: RFC\n   1036 [5], RFC 1496 [6], RFC 1505 [7], RFC 1864\
    \ [9], RFC 2156 [14],\n   RFC 2183 [15], RFC 2045 [11], RFC 2046 [12], RFC 2557\

    \   [28], RFC 2965 [29], and RFC 3282 [31].\n"
- title: 2.2.1.  Application-specific Message Header Fields
  contents:
  - "2.2.1.  Application-specific Message Header Fields\n   Internet applications\
    \ that use similar message headers include\n   Internet mail [26] [4], NNTP newsgroup\
    \ feeds [5], HTTP web access\n   [24] and any other that uses MIME [11] encapsulation\
    \ of message\n   content.\n   In some cases (notably HTTP [24]), the header syntax\
    \ and usage is\n   redefined for the specific application.  This registration\
    \ is\n   concerned only with the allocation and specification of field names,\n\
    \   and not with the details of header implementation in specific\n   protocols.\n\
    \   In some cases, the same field name may be specified differently (by\n   different\
    \ documents) for use with different application protocols;\n   e.g., The Date:\
    \ header field used with HTTP has a different syntax\n   than the Date: used with\
    \ Internet mail.  In other cases, a field name\n   may have a common specification\
    \ across multiple protocols (ignoring\n   protocol-specific lexical and character\
    \ set conventions); e.g., this\n   is generally the case for MIME header fields\
    \ with names of the form\n   'Content-*'.\n   Thus, we need to accommodate application-specific\
    \ fields, while\n   wishing to recognize and promote (where appropriate) commonality\
    \ of\n   other fields across multiple applications.  Common repositories are\n\
    \   used for all applications, and each registered header field specifies\n  \
    \ the application protocol for which the corresponding definition\n   applies.\
    \  A given field name may have multiple registry entries for\n   different protocols;\
    \ in the Permanent Message Header Field registry,\n   a given header field name\
    \ may be registered only once for any given\n   protocol.  (In some cases, the\
    \ registration may reference several\n   defining documents.)\n"
- title: 2.2.2.  MIME Header Fields
  contents:
  - "2.2.2.  MIME Header Fields\n   Some header fields with names of the form Content-*\
    \ are associated\n   with the MIME data object encapsulation and labelling framework.\n\
    \   These header fields can meaningfully be applied to a data object\n   separately\
    \ from the protocol used to carry it.\n   MIME is used with email messages and\
    \ other protocols that specify a\n   MIME-based data object format.  MIME header\
    \ fields used with such\n   protocols are defined in the registry with the protocol\
    \ \"mime\", and\n   as such are presumed to be usable in conjunction with any\
    \ protocol\n   that conveys MIME objects.\n   Other protocols do not convey MIME\
    \ objects, but define a number of\n   header fields with similar names and functions\
    \ to MIME.  Notably,\n   HTTP defines a number of entity header fields that serve\
    \ a purpose in\n   HTTP similar to MIME header fields in email.  Some of these\
    \ header\n   fields have the same names and similar functions to their MIME\n\
    \   counterparts (though there are some variations).  Such header fields\n   must\
    \ be registered separately for any non-MIME-carrying protocol with\n   which they\
    \ may be used.\n   It is poor practice to reuse a header field name from another\n\
    \   protocol simply because the fields have similar (even \"very similar\")\n\
    \   meanings.  Protocols should share header field names only when their\n   meanings\
    \ are identical in all foreseeable circumstances.  In\n   particular, new header\
    \ field names of the form Content-* should not\n   be defined for non-MIME-carrying\
    \ protocols unless their specification\n   is exactly the same as in MIME.\n"
- title: 3.  Registry Usage Requirements
  contents:
  - "3.  Registry Usage Requirements\n   RFCs defining new header fields for Internet\
    \ mail, HTTP, or MIME MUST\n   include appropriate header registration template(s)\
    \ (as given in\n   Section 4.2) for all headers defined in the document in their\
    \ IANA\n   considerations section.  Use of the header registry MAY be mandated\n\
    \   by other protocol specifications, however, in the absence of such a\n   mandate\
    \ use of the registry is not required.\n"
- title: 4.  Registration Procedure
  contents:
  - "4.  Registration Procedure\n   The procedure for registering a message header\
    \ field is:\n   1.  Construct a header field specification\n   2.  Prepare a registration\
    \ template\n   3.  Submit the registration template\n"
- title: 4.1.  Header Field Specification
  contents:
  - "4.1.  Header Field Specification\n   Registration of a new message header field\
    \ starts with construction\n   of a proposal that describes the syntax, semantics\
    \ and intended use\n   of the field.  For entries in the Permanent Message Header\
    \ Field\n   Registry, this proposal MUST be published as an RFC, or as an Open\n\
    \   Standard in the sense described by RFC 2026, section 7 [1].\n   A registered\
    \ field name SHOULD conform at least to the syntax defined\n   by RFC 2822 [4],\
    \ section 3.6.8.\n   Further, the \".\" character is reserved to indicate a naming\
    \ sub-\n   structure and MUST NOT be included in any registered field name.\n\
    \   Currently, no specific sub-structure is defined; if used, any such\n   structure\
    \ MUST be defined by a standards track RFC document.\n   Header field names may\
    \ sometimes be used in URIs, URNs and/or XML.\n   To comply with the syntactic\
    \ constraints of these forms, it is\n   recommended that characters in a registered\
    \ field name are restricted\n   to those that can be used without escaping in\
    \ a URI [20] or URN [13],\n   and that are also legal in XML [32] element names.\n\
    \   Thus, for maximum flexibility, header field names SHOULD further be\n   restricted\
    \ to just letters, digits, hyphen ('-') and underscore ('_')\n   characters, with\
    \ the first character being a letter or underscore.\n"

  - "4.4.  Objections to Registration\n   Listing of an entry in the provisional repository\
    \ should not be\n   lightly refused.  An entry MAY be refused if there is some\
    \ credible\n   reason to believe that such registration will be harmful.  In the\n\
    \   absence of such objection, IANA SHOULD allow any registration that\n   meets\
    \ the criteria set out in Section 4.1 and Section 4.2.2.  Some\n   reasonable\
    \ grounds for refusal might be:\n   o  There is IETF consensus that publication\
    \ is considered likely to\n      harm the Internet technical infrastructure in\
    \ some way.\n   o  Disreputable or frivolous use of the registration facilities.\n\
    \   o  The proposal is sufficiently lacking in purpose, or misleading\n      about\
    \ its purpose, that it can be held to be a waste of time and\n      effort.\n\
    \   o  Conflict with some current IETF activity.\n   Note that objections or disagreements\
    \ about technical detail are not,\n   of themselves, considered grounds to refuse\
    \ listing in the\n   provisional repository.  After all, one of its purposes is\
    \ to allow\n   developers to communicate with a view to combining their ideas,\n\
    \   expertise and energy to the maximum benefit of the Internet\n   community.\n\
    \   Publication in an RFC or other form of Open Standard document (per\n   RFC\
    \ 2026 [1], section 7) is sufficient grounds for publication in the\n   permanent\
    \ registry.\n   To assist IANA in determining whether or not there is a sustainable\n\
    \   objection to any registration, IESG nominates a designated expert to\n   liaise\
    \ with IANA about new registrations.  For the most part, the\n   designated expert's\
    \ role is to confirm to IANA that the registration\n   criteria have been satisfied.\n\
    \   The IESG or their designated expert MAY require any change or\n   commentary\
    \ to be attached to any registry entry.\n   The IESG is the final arbiter of any\
    \ objection.\n"
- title: 4.5.  Change Control
  contents:
  - "4.5.  Change Control\n   Change control of a header field registration is subject\
    \ to the same\n   condition as the initial registration; i.e., publication (or\n\
    \   reclassification) of an Open Standards specification for a Permanent\n   Message\
    \ Header Field, or on request of the indicated author/change\n   controller for\
    \ a Provisional Message Header (like the original\n   submission, subject to review\
    \ on the designated email discussion list\n   [33].)\n   A change to a permanent\
    \ message header field registration MAY be\n   requested by the IESG.\n   A change\
    \ to or retraction of any Provisional Message Header Field\n   Repository entry\
    \ MAY be requested by the IESG or designated expert.\n   IANA MAY remove any Provisional\
    \ Message Header Field Repository entry\n   whose corresponding specification\
    \ document is no longer available\n   (e.g., expired Internet-draft, or URL not\
    \ resolvable).  Anyone may\n   notify IANA of any such cases by sending an email\
    \ to the designated\n   email address [35].  Before removing an entry for this\
    \ reason, IANA\n   SHOULD contact the registered Author/Change controller to determine\n\
    \   whether a replacement for the specification document (consistent with\n  \
    \ the requirements of section Section 4.2.2) is available.\n   It is intended\
    \ that entries in the Permanent Message Header Field\n   Registry may be used\
    \ in the construction of URNs (per RFC 2141 [13])\n   which have particular requirements\
    \ for uniqueness and persistence\n   (per RFC 1737 [8]).  Therefore, once an entry\
    \ is made in the\n   Permanent Message Header Registry, the combination of the\
    \ header name\n   and applicable protocol MUST NOT subsequently be registered\
    \ for any\n   other purpose.  (This is not to preclude revision of the applicable\n\
    \   specification(s) within the appropriate IETF Consensus rules, and\n   corresponding\
    \ updates to the specification citation in the header\n   registration.)\n"

  contents:
  - "4.6.  Comments on Header Definitions\n   Comments on proposed registrations should\
    \ be sent to the designated\n   email discussion list [33].\n"

- title: 5.  IANA Considerations
  contents:
  - "5.  IANA Considerations\n   This specification calls for:\n   o  A new IANA registry\
    \ for permanent message header fields per\n      Section 4 of this document. \
    \ The policy for inclusion in this\n      registry is described in Section 4.1\
    \ and Section 4.2.1.\n   o  A new IANA repository listing provisional message\
    \ header fields\n      per Section 4 of this document.  The policy for inclusion\
    \ in this\n      registry is described in Section 4.1 and Section 4.2.2.\n   o\
    \  IESG appoints a designated expert to advise IANA whether\n      registration\
    \ criteria for proposed registrations have been\n      satisfied.\n   No initial\
    \ registry entries are provided.\n"

  contents:
  - "6.  Security Considerations\n   No security considerations are introduced by\
    \ this specification\n   beyond those already inherent in the use of message headers.\n"
