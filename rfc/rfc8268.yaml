  - "1.  Overview and Rationale\n   Secure Shell (SSH) is a common protocol for secure\
    \ communication on\n   the Internet.  Security protocols and primitives are an\
    \ active area\n   for research and help to suggest updates to SSH.\n   Section\
    \ 8 of [RFC4253] contains a small error in point 3 regarding\n   checking the\
    \ Peer's DH Public Key.  Section 4 of this document\n   provides the correction.\n\
    \   Due to security concerns with SHA-1 [RFC6194] and with MODP groups\n   with\
    \ less than 2048 bits [NIST-SP-800-131Ar1], implementers and users\n   should\
    \ request support for larger Diffie-Hellman (DH) MODP group\n   sizes with data-integrity\
    \ verification by using the SHA-2 family of\n   secure hash algorithms and by\
    \ having MODP groups provide more\n   security.  The use of larger MODP groups\
    \ and the move to the SHA-2\n   family of hashes are important features to strengthen\
    \ the key\n   exchange algorithms available to the SSH client and server.\n  \
    \ DH primes being adopted by this document are all \"safe primes\" such\n   that\
    \ p = 2q + 1 where q is also a prime.  New MODP groups are being\n   introduced\
    \ starting with the MODP 3072-bit group15.  All use SHA512\n   as the hash algorithm.\n\
    \   The DH 2048-bit MODP group14 is already present in most SSH\n   implementations\
    \ and most implementations already have a SHA256\n   implementation, so \"diffie-hellman-group14-sha256\"\
    \ is provided as\n   easy to implement.\n   It is intended that these new MODP\
    \ groups with SHA-2-based hashes\n   update Section 6.4 of [RFC4253] and Section\
    \ 4.10 of [RFC4250].\n   The United States Information Assurance Directorate (IAD)\
    \ at the\n   National Security Agency (NSA) has published \"Commercial National\n\
    \   Security Algorithm Suite and Quantum Computing Frequently Asked\n   Questions\"\
    .  [MFQ-U-OO-815099-15] is addressed to organizations that\n   run classified\
    \ or unclassified national security systems (NSS) and\n   vendors that build products\
    \ used in NSS.\n   This FAQ document indicates that NSS should no longer use:\n\
    \   o  Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) and Elliptic Curve Digital\n     \
    \ Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) with NIST P-256.  (For SSH, this would\n      suggest\
    \ avoiding [RFC5656] Key Exchange Algorithm\n      \"ecdh-sha2-nistp256\" and\
    \ Public Key Algorithm\n      \"ecdsa-sha2-nistp256\".)\n   o  SHA-256 (For SSH,\
    \ this would suggest avoiding any Key Exchange\n      Method using SHA1, SHA224,\
    \ or SHA256 in favor of using SHA384 or\n      SHA512.)\n   o  AES-128 (For SSH,\
    \ this would suggest avoiding Encryption\n      Algorithms [RFC4253] \"aes128-cbc\"\
    \ and [RFC4344] \"aes128-ctr\".)\n   o  RSA with 2048-bit keys (For SSH, this\
    \ would suggest avoiding\n      [RFC4253] \"ssh-rsa\" using RSA with SHA1 as well\
    \ as [RFC6187]\n      \"x509v3-rsa2048-sha256\" as well as any other RSA key that\
    \ has a\n      length less than 3072-bits or uses a hash less than SHA384.)\n\
    \   o  Diffie-Hellman with 2048-bit keys (For SSH, this would suggest\n      avoiding\
    \ use of [RFC4253] both of \"diffie-hellman-group1-sha1\" and\n      \"diffie-hellman-group14-sha1\"\
    \ as well as avoiding\n      \"diffie-hellman-group14-sha256\" added by this document.)\n\
    \   The FAQ also states that NSS users should select DH groups based upon\n  \
    \ well-established and validated parameter sets that comply with the\n   minimum\
    \ required sizes.  Some specific examples include:\n   o  Elliptic Curves are\
    \ currently restricted to the NIST P-384 group\n      only for both ECDH and ECDSA,\
    \ in accordance with existing NIST and\n      National Information Assurance Partnership\
    \ (NIAP) standards.  (For\n      SSH, this means using [RFC5656] \"ecdh-sha2-nistp384\"\
    \ for key\n      exchange and \"ecdsa-sha2-nistp384\" for Public Key Algorithm\n\
    \      Names.)\n   o  RSA moduli should have a minimum size of 3072 bits (other\
    \ than the\n      noted PKI exception), and keys should be generated in accordance\n\
    \      with all relevant NIST standards.\n   o  For Diffie-Hellman, use a Diffie-Hellman\
    \ prime modulus of at least\n      3072 bits.  (For bit sizes as specified in\
    \ [RFC3526], this would\n      allow for any of group15, group16, group17, group18\
    \ to be used.)\n   Although SSH may not always be used to protect Top Secret\n\
    \   communications, this document adopts the use of the DH groups\n   provided\
    \ as an example in the FAQ as well as the use of SHA512 rather\n   than SHA256\
    \ for the new DH groups.\n"

  contents:
  - "3.  Key Exchange Algorithms\n   This document adds some new Key Exchange Algorithm\
    \ Method Names to\n   what originally appeared in [RFC4253] and [RFC4250].\n \
    \  This document adopts the style and conventions of [RFC4253] in\n   specifying\
    \ how the use of new data key exchange is indicated in SSH.\n   The following\
    \ new key exchange method algorithms are defined:\n   o  diffie-hellman-group14-sha256\n\
    \   o  diffie-hellman-group15-sha512\n   o  diffie-hellman-group16-sha512\n  \
    \ o  diffie-hellman-group17-sha512\n   o  diffie-hellman-group18-sha512\n   The\
    \ SHA-2 family of secure hash algorithms is defined in [RFC6234].\n   The method\
    \ of key exchange used for the name \"diffie-hellman-\n   group14-sha256\" is\
    \ the same as that for \"diffie-hellman-group14-sha1\"\n   except that the SHA256\
    \ hash algorithm is used.  It is recommended\n   that \"diffie-hellman-group14-sha256\"\
    \ SHOULD be supported to smooth\n   the transition to newer group sizes.\n   The\
    \ group15 through group18 names are the same as those specified in\n   [RFC3526]:\
    \ 3072-bit MODP group15, 4096-bit MODP group16, 6144-bit\n   MODP group17, and\
    \ 8192-bit MODP group18.\n   The SHA512 algorithm is to be used when \"sha512\"\
    \ is specified as a\n   part of the key exchange method name.\n"
- title: 4.  Checking the Peer's DH Public Key
  contents:
  - "4.  Checking the Peer's DH Public Key\n   Section 8 of [RFC4253] contains a small\
    \ error in point 3.  When\n   checking e (client Public Key) and f (server Public\
    \ Key) values, an\n   incorrect range is provided.  The erroneous text is:\n \
    \     Values of 'e' or 'f' that are not in the range [1, p-1] MUST NOT\n     \
    \ be sent or accepted by either side.  If this condition is\n      violated, the\
    \ key exchange fails.\n   The problem is that the range should have been an open\
    \ interval\n   excluding the endpoint values. (i.e., \"(1, p-1)\").  This document\n\
    \   amends that document text as follows:\n      DH Public Key values MUST be\
    \ checked and both conditions:\n         1 < e < p-1\n         1 < f < p-1\n \
    \     MUST be true.  Values not within these bounds MUST NOT be sent or\n    \
    \  accepted by either side.  If either one of these conditions is\n      violated,\
    \ then the key exchange fails.\n   This simple check ensures that:\n   o  The\
    \ remote peer behaves properly.\n   o  The local system is not forced into the\
    \ two-element subgroup.\n"

    \   \"Determining Strengths For Public Keys Used For Exchanging Symmetric\n  \
    \ Keys\" [RFC3766].  Care should be taken to use sufficient entropy and/\n   or\
    \ deterministic random-bit generator (DRBG) algorithms to maximize\n   the true\
    \ security strength of the key exchange and ciphers selected.\n   Using a fixed\
    \ set of Diffie-Hellman parameters makes them a high\n   value target for pre-computation.\
    \  Generating additional sets of\n   primes to be used, or moving to larger values\
    \ mitigates this issue.\n"
