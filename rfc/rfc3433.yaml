    the documents that describe the current\n   Internet-Standard Management Framework,
    please refer to section 7 of\n   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].\n   Managed objects are accessed
    via a virtual information store, termed\n   the Management Information Base or
    MIB.  MIB objects are generally\n   accessed through the Simple Network Management
    Protocol (SNMP).\n   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined
    in the\n   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB\n
    \  module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,\n   RFC
    2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580\n   [RFC2580].\n"

  - "2.  Overview\n   There is a need for a standardized way of obtaining information\n
    \  related to the physical sensors which are commonly found in\n   networking
    equipment.  Information such as the current value of the\n   sensor, the current
    operational status, and the data units precision\n   associated with the sensor,
    should be represented in a consistent\n   manner for any type of sensor.\n   Physical
    sensors are represented in the Entity MIB with\n   entPhysicalEntry and an entPhysicalClass
    value of 'sensor(8)'.  The\n   information provided in the ENTITY-SENSOR-MIB module
    (defined in this\n   document) defines a sparse augmentation of the entPhysicalTable,
    for\n   entries which represent physical sensors.\n"

      \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\",  \"MAY\", and
      \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n   document are to be interpreted as described in BCP

    - "2.2.  Relationship to the Entity MIB\n   The MIB objects defined in this document
      provide a sparse\n   augmentation to the entPhysicalTable in the Entity MIB,
      for entries\n   in which the associated entPhysicalClass object is equal to\n
      \  'sensor(8)'.  An agent is expected to maintain an entPhySensorEntry\n   with
      the same entPhysicalIndex value for each entPhysicalEntry\n   representing a
      physical sensor.  Therefore, implementation of the\n   entityPhysicalGroup is
      required for agents that implement the Entity\n   Sensor MIB.\n"

  - contents:
    - "2.3.  Relationship to General Thresholding Mechanisms\n   There are no specialized
      sensor value thresholding mechanisms defined\n   in this MIB module.  Instead,
      it is recommended that a generalized\n   thresholding MIB, such as the mechanisms
      defined by the Alarm and\n   Events groups of the Remote Network Monitoring
      MIB [RFC2819], be used\n   for this purpose.\n"

  title: 2.  Overview
- contents:
  - "3.  MIB Structure\n   The Entity Sensor MIB contains a single group called the\n
    \  entitySensorValueGroup, which allows objects to convey the current\n   value
    and status of a physical sensor.\n   The entitySensorValueGroup contains a single
    table, called the\n   entPhySensorTable, which provides a small number of read-only\n
    \  objects:\n   entPhySensorType\n      This object identifies the type of data
    units associated with the\n      sensor value.\n   entPhySensorScale\n      This
    object identifies the (power of 10) scaling factor associated\n      with the
    sensor value.\n   entPhySensorPrecision\n      This object identifies the number
    of decimal places of precision\n      associated with the sensor value.\n   entPhySensorValue\n
    \     This object identifies the current value of the sensor.\n   entPhySensorOperStatus\n
    \     This object identifies the current operational status of the\n      sensor
    (as it's known to the agent).\n   entPhySensorUnitsDisplay\n      This object
    provides a textual description of the data units\n      represented by the entPhySensorType
    and entPhySensorScale objects.\n   entPhySensorValueTimeStamp\n      The object
    identifies the value of sysUpTime at the time the agent\n      last updated the
    information in the entry.  This object is only\n      relevant if the agent uses
    a polling implementation strategy,\n      (i.e., the associated entPhySensorValueUpdateRate
    object is\n      greater than zero).\n   entPhySensorValueUpdateRate\n      This
    object indicates the nature of the agent implementation of\n      the entPhySensorEntry,
    and contains the (possibly estimated)\n      number of milliseconds that elapse
    between polling updates of the\n      information in the associated entry.  The
    value zero indicates\n      that the agent always return current data for the
    entry (as\n      opposed to the data as it was at the last polling interval).\n"

  - "9.  Security Considerations\n   There is one managed object in this MIB that
    may contain sensitive\n   information.  This is:\n       entPhySensorValue\n   This
    object may expose the values of particular physical sensors for\n   a device.\n
    \  SNMPv1 by itself is not a secure environment.  Even if the network\n   itself
    is secure (for example by using IPSec), there is no control as\n   to who on the
    secure network is allowed to access and GET/SET\n   (read/change/create/delete)
    the objects in this MIB.\n   It is recommended that the implementors consider
    the security\n   features as provided by the SNMPv3 framework.  Specifically,
    the use\n   of the User-based Security Model STD 62, RFC 3414 [RFC3414] and the\n
    \  View-based Access Control Model STD 62, RFC 3415 [RFC3415] is\n   recommended.\n
    \  It is then a customer/user responsibility to ensure that the SNMP\n   entity
    giving access to an instance of this MIB, is properly\n   configured to give access
    to only the objects, and those principals\n   (users) that have legitimate rights
    to indeed GET or SET\n   (change/create/delete) them.\n"
