- title: Abstract
  contents:
  - "Abstract\n   A Media Gateway Control Protocol (MGCP) endpoint that has encountered\n\
    \   an adverse failure condition (such as being involved in a transient\n   call\
    \ when a Call Agent failover occurred) could be left in a lockstep\n   state whereby\
    \ events are quarantined but not notified.  The MGCP\n   package described in\
    \ this document provides a mechanism for reporting\n   these situations so that\
    \ the new Call Agent can take the necessary\n   fault recovery procedures.\n"
- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   In the Media Gateway Control Protocol (MGCP) [2], when an\
    \ endpoint\n   operating in \"step\" mode generates a Notify, it will enter the\n\
    \   notification state, where it waits for a response to the Notify.\n   Furthermore,\
    \ the endpoint must wait for a new NotificationRequest\n   before it can resume\
    \ event processing.  As long as the endpoint is\n   waiting for this NotificationRequest,\
    \ we say that it is in the\n   lockstep state.\n   An endpoint that is in the\
    \ lockstep state cannot perform any event\n   processing and therefore also cannot\
    \ generate a new Notify.\n   Endpoints should only be in the lockstep state for\
    \ a very short time.\n   However, in adverse conditions, an endpoint could potentially\
    \ end in\n   the lockstep state without the Call Agent realizing it.  Clearly,\n\
    \   this could have very negative consequences in terms of the service\n   provided.\n\
    \   The Lockstep package defined in this document defines extensions to\n   the\
    \ EndpointConfiguration and RestartInProgress commands that allow a\n   Call Agent\
    \ to request an endpoint to inform it when the endpoint is\n   in the lockstep\
    \ state for a specified period of time.\n"

- title: 2.  Lockstep Package
  contents:
  - "2.  Lockstep Package\n   Package Name: LCK\n   Version: 0\n   Package Description:\
    \ The purpose of this package is to provide a\n   mechanism for reporting a condition\
    \ in which an endpoint has been in\n   the \"lockstep state\" for a specified\
    \ period of time.\n   There are two aspects of this package:\n      *  The ability\
    \ for a Call Agent to request endpoints to report if\n         they are in lockstep\
    \ state for a specified period of time.\n         This is done with the EndpointConfiguration\
    \ command, as\n         described in section 2.1.\n      *  The reporting mechanism\
    \ itself, which is done with a new\n         \"lockstep\" RestartMethod for the\
    \ RSIP command as described in\n         section 2.2.\n"
- title: 2.1.  Request to Report Lockstep State
  contents:
  - "2.1.  Request to Report Lockstep State\n   The new \"LCK/LST\" EndpointConfiguration\
    \ parameter is used by the Call\n   Agent to request the reporting of \"lockstep\"\
    \ state.  It uses the\n   following ABNF:\n      \"LCK/LST:\" 0*WSP LSTIME\n \
    \     LSTIME = 1*(4DIGIT)\n   where LSTIME is expressed in seconds, with a value\
    \ ranging from 0 to\n   9999.  A value greater than 2*T-HIST (refer to [2]) is\
    \ RECOMMENDED.\n   LSTIME is the amount of time the endpoint is in the lockstep\
    \ state\n   before reporting.  The timer starts when the endpoint enters the\n\
    \   lockstep state and is canceled if the endpoint leaves the lockstep\n   state\
    \ before the timeout occurs.  The value provided remains in\n   effect until explicitly\
    \ changed (or a restart occurs).  If the\n   endpoint is already in the lockstep\
    \ state when a non-zero timer value\n   is provided, the lockstep timer is simply\
    \ started with the value\n   provided; any existing lockstep timer is cancelled.\
    \  The value zero\n   is used to turn off reporting.\n   This parameter can be\
    \ audited by using the AuditEndpoint command.\n   The value returned is the last\
    \ configured value, or the value zero\n   when no value was configured.\n"
- title: 2.2.  Lockstep Restart Method
  contents:
  - "2.2.  Lockstep Restart Method\n   A new \"lockstep\" restart method is defined\
    \ in the \"LCK\" package.  A\n   RestartInProgress (RSIP) will be sent with this\
    \ RestartMethod if the\n   endpoint has been configured with a non-zero value\
    \ for LSTIME and\n   that timer has expired.  Note that once the lockstep timer\
    \ has been\n   set, it can fire only once per Notify command; however it is possible\n\
    \   to set the timer more than once while an endpoint is in lockstep\n   state\
    \ (and hence rearm it for that particular Notify).  The syntax of\n   the restart\
    \ method is as per [2]:\n      \"RM\" \":\" 0*(WSP) \"LCK/lockstep\"\n   RestartDelay\
    \ (see [2]) is not used with the \"lockstep\" RestartMethod.\n   Also, the \"\
    lockstep\" RestartMethod does not define a service-state,\n   and thus it will\
    \ never be returned when auditing the RestartMethod.\n"

  contents:
  - "4.  Security Considerations\n   Section 5 of the base MGCP specification [2]\
    \ discusses security\n   requirements for the base MGCP protocol that apply equally\
    \ to the\n   package defined in this document.  Use of a security Protocol such\
    \ as\n   IPsec (RFC 2401, RFC 2406) that provides per message authentication\n\
    \   and integrity services is required to ensure that requests and\n   responses\
    \ are obtained from authenticated sources and that messages\n   have not been\
    \ modified.  Without these services, gateways and Call\n   Agents are open to\
    \ attacks.\n"
