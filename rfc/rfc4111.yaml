- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   Security is an integral aspect of Provider-Provisioned Virtual\n\
    \   Private Network (PPVPN) services.  The motivation and rationale for\n   both\
    \ Provider-Provisioned Layer-2 VPN and Provider-Provisioned\n   Layer-3 VPN services\
    \ are provided by [RFC4110] and [RFC4031].  These\n   documents acknowledge that\
    \ security is an important and integral\n   aspect of PPVPN services, for both\
    \ VPN customers and VPN service\n   providers.  Both will benefit from a PPVPN\
    \ Security Framework\n   document that lists the customer and provider security\
    \ requirements\n   related to PPVPN services, and that can be used to assess how\
    \ much a\n   particular technology protects against security threats and fulfills\n\
    \   the security requirements.\n   First, we describe the security threats that\
    \ are relevant in the\n   context of PPVPNs, and the defensive techniques that\
    \ can be used to\n   combat those threats.  We consider security issues deriving\
    \ both from\n   malicious or incorrect behavior of users and other parties and\
    \ from\n   negligent or incorrect behavior of the providers.  An important part\n\
    \   of security defense is the detection and report of a security attack,\n  \
    \ which is also addressed in this document.  Special considerations\n   engendered\
    \ by IP mobility within PPVPNs are not in the scope of this\n   document.\n  \
    \ Then, we discuss the possible user and provider security requirements\n   for\
    \ a PPVPN service.  Users expectations must be met for the security\n   characteristics\
    \ of a VPN service.  These user requirements translate\n   into corresponding\
    \ requirements for the providers offering the\n   service.  Furthermore, providers\
    \ have security requirements to\n   protect their network infrastructure, securing\
    \ it to the level\n   required to provide the PPVPN services in addition to other\
    \ services.\n   Finally, we define a template that may be used to describe the\n\
    \   security characteristics of a specific PPVPN technology in a manner\n   consistent\
    \ with the security framework described in this document.\n   It is not within\
    \ the scope of this document to analyze the security\n   properties of specific\
    \ technologies.  Instead, our intention is to\n   provide a common tool, in the\
    \ form of a checklist, that may be used\n   in other documents dedicated to an\
    \ in-depth security analysis of\n   individual PPVPN technologies to describe\
    \ their security\n   characteristics in a comprehensive and coherent way, thereby\n\
    \   providing a common ground for comparison between different\n   technologies.\n\
    \   It is important to clarify that this document is limited to\n   describing\
    \ users' and providers' security requirements that pertain\n   to PPVPN services.\
    \  It is not the intention to formulate precise\n   \"requirements\" on each specific\
    \ technology by defining the mechanisms\n   and techniques that must be implemented\
    \ to satisfy such users' and\n   providers' requirements.\n   This document is\
    \ organized as follows.  Section 2 defines the\n   terminology used in the document.\
    \  Section 3 defines the security\n   reference model for security in PPVPN networks.\
    \  Section 4 describes\n   the security threats that are specific of PPVPNs. \
    \ Section 5 reviews\n   defense techniques that may be used against those threats.\
    \  Section 6\n   describes how attacks may be detected and reported.  Section\
    \ 7\n   discusses the user security requirements that apply to PPVPN\n   services.\
    \  Section 8 describes additional security requirements on\n   the provider to\
    \ guarantee the security of the network infrastructure\n   providing PPVPN services.\
    \  In Section 9, we provide a template that\n   may be used to describe the security\
    \ characteristics of specific\n   PPVPN technologies.  Finally, Section 10 discusses\
    \ security\n   considerations.\n"
- title: 2.  Terminology
  contents:
  - "2.  Terminology\n   This document uses PPVPN-specific terminology.  Definitions\
    \ and\n   details specific to PPVPN terminology can be found in [RFC4026] and\n\
    \   [RFC4110].  The most important definitions are repeated in this\n   section;\
    \ for other definitions, the reader is referred to\n   [RFC4026] and [RFC4110].\n\
    \      CE: Customer Edge device, a router or a switch in the customer\n      \
    \   network interfacing with the service provider's network.\n      P: Provider\
    \ Router.  The Provider Router is a router in the\n         service provider's\
    \ core network that does not have interfaces\n         directly toward the customer.\
    \  A P router is used to\n         interconnect the PE routers.  A P router does\
    \ not have to\n         maintain VPN state and is thus VPN unaware.\n      PE:\
    \ Provider Edge device, the equipment in the service provider's\n         network\
    \ that interfaces with the equipment in the customer's\n         network.\n  \
    \    PPVPN: Provider-Provisioned Virtual Private Network, a VPN that is\n    \
    \     configured and managed by the service provider (and thus not by\n      \
    \   the customer itself).\n      SP: Service Provider.\n      VPN: Virtual Private\
    \ Network, which restricts communication\n         between a set of sites using\
    \ an IP backbone shared by traffic\n         that is not going to or coming from\
    \ those sites.\n"
- title: 3.  Security Reference Model
  contents:
  - "3.  Security Reference Model\n   This section defines a reference model for security\
    \ in PPVPN\n   networks.\n   A PPVPN core network is the central network infrastructure\
    \ (P and PE\n   routers) over which PPVPN services are delivered.  A PPVPN core\n\
    \   network consists of one or more SP networks.  All network elements in\n  \
    \ the core are under the operational control of one or more PPVPN\n   service\
    \ providers.  Even if the PPVPN core is provided by several\n   service providers,\
    \ it appears to the PPVPN users as a single zone of\n   trust.  However, several\
    \ service providers providing a common PPVPN\n   core still have to secure themselves\
    \ against the other providers.\n   PPVPN services can also be delivered over the\
    \ Internet, in which case\n   the Internet forms a logical part of the PPVPN core.\n\
    \   A PPVPN user is a company, institution or residential client of the\n   PPVPN\
    \ service provider.\n   A PPVPN service is a private network service made available\
    \ by a\n   service provider to a PPVPN user.  The service is implemented using\n\
    \   virtual constructs built on a shared PPVPN core network.  A PPVPN\n   service\
    \ interconnects sites of a PPVPN user.\n   Extranets are VPNs in which multiple\
    \ sites are controlled by\n   different (legal) entities.  Extranets are another\
    \ example of PPVPN\n   deployment scenarios wherein restricted and controlled\
    \ communication\n   is allowed between trusted zones, often via well-defined transit\n\
    \   points.\n   This document defines each PPVPN as a trusted zone and the PPVPN\
    \ core\n   as another trusted zone.  A primary concern is security aspects that\n\
    \   relate to breaches of security from the \"outside\" of a trusted zone\n  \
    \ to the \"inside\" of this zone.  Figure 1 depicts the concept of\n   trusted\
    \ zones within the PPVPN framework.\n      +------------+                    \

    \                   Figure 1: The PPVPN trusted zone model\n   In principle, the\
    \ trusted zones should be separate.  However, PPVPN\n   core networks often offer\
    \ Internet access, in which case a transit\n   point (marked \"XXX\" in the figure)\
    \ is defined.\n   The key requirement of a \"virtual private\" network (VPN) is\
    \ that the\n   security of the trusted zone of the VPN is not compromised by sharing\n\
    \   the core infrastructure with other VPNs.\n   Security against threats that\
    \ originate within the same trusted zone\n   as their targets (for example, attacks\
    \ from a user in a PPVPN to\n   other users within the same PPVPN, or attacks\
    \ entirely within the\n   core network) is outside the scope of this document.\n\
    \   Also outside the scope are all aspects of network security that are\n   independent\
    \ of whether a network is a PPVPN network or a private\n   network.  For example,\
    \ attacks from the Internet to a web server\n   inside a given PPVPN will not\
    \ be considered here, unless the\n   provisioning of the PPVPN network could make\
    \ a difference to the\n   security of this server.\n"
- title: 4.  Security Threats
  contents:
  - "4.  Security Threats\n   This section discusses the various network security\
    \ threats that may\n   endanger PPVPNs.  The discussion is limited to threats\
    \ that are\n   unique to PPVPNs, or that affect PPVPNs in unique ways.  A successful\n\
    \   attack on a particular PPVPN or on a service provider's PPVPN\n   infrastructure\
    \ may cause one or more of the following ill effects:\n   -  observation, modification,\
    \ or deletion of PPVPN user data,\n   -  replay of PPVPN user data,\n   -  injection\
    \ of non-authentic data into a PPVPN,\n   -  traffic pattern analysis on PPVPN\
    \ traffic,\n   -  disruption of PPVPN connectivity, or\n   -  degradation of PPVPN\
    \ service quality.\n   It is useful to consider that threats to a PPVPN, whether\
    \ malicious\n   or accidental, may come from different categories of sources.\
    \  For\n   example they may come from:\n   -  users of other PPVPNs provided by\
    \ the same PPVPN service provider,\n   -  the PPVPN service provider or persons\
    \ working for it,\n   -  other persons who obtain physical access to a service\
    \ provider\n      site,\n   -  other persons who use social engineering methods\
    \ to influence\n      behavior of service provider personnel,\n   -  users of\
    \ the PPVPN itself, i.e., intra-VPN threats (such threats\n      are beyond the\
    \ scope of this document), or\n   -  others, i.e., attackers from the Internet\
    \ at large.\n   In the case of PPVPNs, some parties may be in more advantageous\n\
    \   positions that enable them to launch types of attacks not available\n   to\
    \ others.  For example, users of different PPVPNs provided by the\n   same service\
    \ provider may be able to launch attacks that those who\n   are completely outside\
    \ the network cannot.\n   Given that security is generally a compromise between\
    \ expense and\n   risk, it is also useful to consider the likelihood of different\n\
    \   attacks.  There is at least a perceived difference in the likelihood\n   of\
    \ most types of attacks being successfully mounted in different\n   environments,\
    \ such as\n   -  in a PPVPN contained within one service provider's network, or\n\
    \   -  in a PPVPN transiting the public Internet.\n   Most types of attacks become\
    \ easier to mount, and hence more likely,\n   as the shared infrastructure that\
    \ provides VPN service expands from a\n   single service provider to multiple\
    \ cooperating providers, and then\n   to the global Internet.  Attacks that may\
    \ not be sufficiently likely\n   to warrant concern in a closely controlled environment\
    \ often merit\n   defensive measures in broader, more open environments.\n   The\
    \ following sections discuss specific types of exploits that\n   threaten PPVPNs.\n"

    \ e.g., routing\n   protocols running from PPVPN user site to PPVPN user site\

    \ of\n   attack is generally considered significantly less of a concern than\n\
    \   are the other types discussed in this section.\n"
- title: 4.1.6.  Denial-of-Service Attacks on the VPN
  contents:
  - "4.1.6.  Denial-of-Service Attacks on the VPN\n   Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks\
    \ are those in which an attacker\n   attempts to disrupt or prevent the use of\
    \ a service by its legitimate\n   users.  Taking network devices out of service,\
    \ modifying their\n   configuration, or overwhelming them with requests for service\
    \ are\n   several of the possible avenues for DoS attack.\n   Overwhelming the\
    \ network with requests for service, otherwise known\n   as a \"resource exhaustion\"\
    \ DoS attack, may target any resource in the\n   network, e.g., link bandwidth,\
    \ packet forwarding capacity, session\n   capacity for various protocols, and\
    \ CPU power.\n   DoS attacks of the resource exhaustion type can be mounted against\n\
    \   the data plane of a particular PPVPN by attempting to insert (spoof)\n   an\
    \ overwhelming quantity of non-authentic data into the VPN from\n   outside of\
    \ that VPN.  Potential results might be to exhaust the\n   bandwidth available\
    \ to that VPN or to overwhelm the cryptographic\n   authentication mechanisms\
    \ of the VPN.\n   Data plane resource exhaustion attacks can also be mounted by\n\
    \   overwhelming the service provider's general (VPN-independent)\n   infrastructure\
    \ with traffic.  These attacks on the general\n   infrastructure are not usually\
    \ a PPVPN-specific issue, unless the\n   attack is mounted by another PPVPN user\
    \ from a privileged position.\n   For example, a PPVPN user might be able to monopolize\
    \ network data\n   plane resources and thus to disrupt other PPVPNs.)\n"

  contents:
  - "4.2.  Attacks on the Control Plane\n   This category encompasses attacks on the\
    \ control structures operated\n   by the PPVPN service provider.\n"
- title: 4.2.1.  Denial-of-Service Attacks on Network Infrastructure
  contents:
  - "4.2.1.  Denial-of-Service Attacks on Network Infrastructure\n   Control plane\
    \ DoS attacks can be mounted specifically against the\n   mechanisms that the\

    \ general infrastructure of the service\n   provider (e.g., P routers or shared\
    \ aspects of PE routers.)   Attacks\n   against the general infrastructure are\
    \ within the scope of this\n   document only if the attack happens in relation\
    \ to the VPN service;\n   otherwise, they are not a PPVPN-specific issue.\n  \
    \ Of special concern for PPVPNs is denial of service to one PPVPN user\n   caused\
    \ by the activities of another.  This can occur, for example, if\n   one PPVPN\
    \ user's activities are allowed to consume excessive network\n   resources of\
    \ any sort that are also needed to serve other PPVPN\n   users.\n   The attacks\
    \ described in the following sections may each have denial\n   of service as one\

    \ (statistics, topology, etc.) about one or more\n   PPVPNs.\n   This can be accomplished\
    \ through malicious entrance of the systems,\n   or as an inadvertent consequence\
    \ of inadequate inter-VPN isolation in\n   a PPVPN user self-management interface.\

  - "5.  Defensive Techniques for PPVPN Service Providers\n   The defensive techniques\
    \ discussed in this document are intended to\n   describe methods by which some\
    \ security threats can be addressed.\n   They are not intended as requirements\
    \ for all PPVPN implementations.\n   The PPVPN provider should determine the applicability\
    \ of these\n   techniques to the provider's specific service offerings, and the\n\
    \   PPVPN user may wish to assess the value of these techniques in regard\n  \
    \ to the user's VPN requirements.\n   The techniques discussed here include encryption,\
    \ authentication,\n   filtering, firewalls, access control, isolation, aggregation,\
    \ and\n   other techniques.\n   Nothing is ever 100% secure.  Defense therefore\
    \ protects against\n   those attacks that are most likely to occur or that could\
    \ have the\n   most dire consequences.  Absolute protection against these attacks\
    \ is\n   seldom achievable; more often it is sufficient to make the cost of a\n\
    \   successful attack greater than what the adversary would be willing to\n  \
    \ expend.\n   Successful defense against an attack does not necessarily mean that\n\
    \   the attack must be prevented from happening or from reaching its\n   target.\
    \  In many cases, the network can instead be designed to\n   withstand the attack.\
    \  For example, the introduction of non-authentic\n   packets could be defended\
    \ against by preventing their introduction in\n   the first place, or by making\
    \ it possible to identify and eliminate\n   them before delivery to the PPVPN\
    \ user's system.  The latter is\n   frequently a much easier task.\n"
- title: 5.1.  Cryptographic Techniques
  contents:
  - "5.1.  Cryptographic Techniques\n   PPVPN defenses against a wide variety of attacks\
    \ can be enhanced by\n   the proper application of cryptographic techniques. \
    \ These are the\n   same cryptographic techniques that are applicable to general\
    \ network\n   communications.  In general, these techniques can provide\n   confidentiality\
    \ (encryption) of communication between devices,\n   authentication of the identities\
    \ of the devices, and detection of a\n   change of the protected data during transit.\n\
    \   Privacy is a key part (the middle name!) of any Virtual Private\n   Network.\
    \  In a PPVPN, privacy can be provided by two mechanisms:\n   traffic separation\
    \ and encryption.  This section focuses on\n   encryption; traffic separation\
    \ is addressed separately.\n   Several aspects of authentication are addressed\
    \ in some detail in a\n   separate \"Authentication\" section.\n   Encryption\
    \ adds complexity, and thus it may not be a standard\n   offering within every\
    \ PPVPN service.  There are a few reasons for\n   this.  Encryption adds an additional\
    \ computational burden to the\n   devices performing encryption and decryption.\
    \  This may reduce the\n   number of user VPN connections that can be handled\
    \ on a device or\n   otherwise reduce the capacity of the device, potentially\
    \ driving up\n   the provider's costs.  Typically, configuring encryption services\
    \ on\n   devices adds to the complexity of the device configuration and adds\n\
    \   incremental labor cost.  Encrypting packets typically increases\n   packet\
    \ lengths, thereby increasing the network traffic load and the\n   likelihood\
    \ of packet fragmentation, with its increased overhead.\n   (Packet length increase\
    \ can often be mitigated to some extent by data\n   compression techniques, but\
    \ with additional computational burden.)\n   Finally, some PPVPN providers may\
    \ employ enough other defensive\n   techniques, such as physical isolation or\
    \ filtering/firewall\n   techniques, that they may not perceive additional benefit\
    \ from\n   encryption techniques.\n   The trust model among the PPVPN user, the\
    \ PPVPN provider, and other\n   parts of the network is a key element in determining\
    \ the\n   applicability of encryption for any specific PPVPN implementation.\n\
    \   In particular, it determines where encryption should be applied, as\n   follows.\n\
    \      -  If the data path between the user's site and the provider's PE\n   \
    \      is not trusted, then encryption may be used on the PE-CE link.\n      -\
    \  If some part of the backbone network is not trusted,\n         particularly\
    \ in implementations where traffic may travel across\n         the Internet or\
    \ multiple provider networks, then the PE-PE\n         traffic may be encrypted.\n\
    \      -  If the PPVPN user does not trust any zone outside of its\n         premises,\
    \ it may require end-to-end or CE-CE encryption\n         service.  This service\
    \ fits within the scope of this PPVPN\n         security framework when the CE\
    \ is provisioned by the PPVPN\n         provider.\n      -  If the PPVPN user\
    \ requires remote access to a PPVPN from a\n         system that is not at a PPVPN\
    \ customer location (for example,\n         access by a traveler), there may be\
    \ a requirement for\n         encrypting the traffic between that system and an\
    \ access point\n         on the PPVPN or at a customer site.  If the PPVPN provider\n\
    \         provides the access point, then the customer must cooperate\n      \
    \   with the provider to handle the access control services for the\n        \
    \ remote users.  These access control services are usually\n         implemented\
    \ by using encryption, as well.\n   Although CE-CE encryption provides confidentiality\
    \ against third-\n   party interception, if the PPVPN provider has complete management\n\
    \   control over the CE (encryption) devices, then it may be possible for\n  \
    \ the provider to gain access to the user's VPN traffic or internal\n   network.\
    \  Encryption devices can potentially be configured to use\n   null encryption,\
    \ to bypass encryption processing altogether, or to\n   provide some means of\
    \ sniffing or diverting unencrypted traffic.\n   Thus, a PPVPN implementation\
    \ using CE-CE encryption has to consider\n   the trust relationship between the\
    \ PPVPN user and provider.  PPVPN\n   users and providers may wish to negotiate\
    \ a service level agreement\n   (SLA) for CE-CE encryption that will provide an\
    \ acceptable\n   demarcation of responsibilities for management of encryption\
    \ on the\n   CE devices.\n   The demarcation may also be affected by the capabilities\
    \ of the CE\n   devices.  For example, the CE might support some partitioning\
    \ of\n   management or a configuration lock-down ability, or it might allow\n\
    \   both parties to verify the configuration.  In general, if the managed\n  \
    \ CE-CE model is used, the PPVPN user has to have a fairly high level\n   of trust\
    \ that the PPVPN provider will properly provision and manage\n   the CE devices.\n"

  contents:
  - "5.1.1.  IPsec in PPVPNs\n   IPsec [RFC2401] [RFC2402] [RFC2406] [RFC2407] [RFC2411]\
    \ is the\n   security protocol of choice for encryption at the IP layer (Layer\
    \ 3),\n   as discussed in [RFC3631].  IPsec provides robust security for IP\n\
    \   traffic between pairs of devices.  Non-IP traffic must be converted\n   to\
    \ IP packets, or it cannot be transported over IPsec.  Encapsulation\n   is a\
    \ common conversion method.\n   In the PPVPN model, IPsec can be employed to protect\
    \ IP traffic\n   between PEs, between a PE and a CE, or from CE to CE.  CE-to-CE\
    \ IPsec\n   may be employed in either a provider-provisioned or a user-\n   provisioned\
    \ model.  The user-provisioned CE-CE IPsec model is outside\n   the scope of this\
    \ document and outside the scope of the PPVPN Working\n   Group.  Likewise, data\
    \ encryption that is performed within the user's\n   site is outside the scope\
    \ of this document, as it is simply handled\n   as user data by the PPVPN.  IPsec\
    \ can also be used to protect IP\n   traffic between a remote user and the PPVPN.\n\
    \   IPsec does not itself specify an encryption algorithm.  It can use a\n   variety\
    \ of encryption algorithms with various key lengths, such as\n   AES encryption.\
    \  There are trade-offs between key length,\n   computational burden, and the\
    \ level of security of the encryption.  A\n   full discussion of these trade-offs\
    \ is beyond the scope of this\n   document.  In order to assess the level of security\
    \ offered by a\n   particular IPsec-based PPVPN service, some PPVPN users may\
    \ wish to\n   know the specific encryption algorithm and effective key length\
    \ used\n   by the PPVPN provider.  However, in practice, any currently\n   recommended\
    \ IPsec encryption offers enough security to substantially\n   reduce the likelihood\
    \ of being directly targeted by an attacker.\n   Other, weaker, links in the chain\
    \ of security are likely to be\n   attacked first.  PPVPN users may wish to use\
    \ a Service Level\n   Agreement (SLA) specifying the service provider's responsibility\
    \ for\n   ensuring data confidentiality rather than to analyze the specific\n\
    \   encryption techniques used in the PPVPN service.\n   For many of the PPVPN\
    \ provider's network control messages and some\n   PPVPN user requirements, cryptographic\
    \ authentication of messages\n   without encryption of the contents of the message\
    \ may provide\n   acceptable security.  With IPsec, authentication of messages\
    \ is\n   provided by the Authentication Header (AH) or by the Encapsulating\n\
    \   Security Protocol (ESP) with authentication only.  Where control\n   messages\
    \ require authentication but do not use IPsec, other\n   cryptographic authentication\
    \ methods are available.  Message\n   authentication methods currently considered\
    \ to be secure are based on\n   hashed message authentication codes (HMAC) [RFC2104]\
    \ implemented with\n   a secure hash algorithm such as Secure Hash Algorithm 1\
    \ (SHA-1)\n   [RFC3174].\n   One recommended mechanism for providing a combination\n\
    \   confidentiality, data origin authentication, and connectionless\n   integrity\
    \ is the use of AES in Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) Mode, with\n   an explicit\
    \ Initialization Vector (IV) [RFC3602], as the IPsec ESP.\n   PPVPNs that provide\
    \ differentiated services based on traffic type may\n   encounter some conflicts\
    \ with IPsec encryption of traffic.  As\n   encryption hides the content of the\
    \ packets, it may not be possible\n   to differentiate the encrypted traffic in\
    \ the same manner as\n   unencrypted traffic.  Although DiffServ markings are\
    \ copied to the\n   IPsec header and can provide some differentiation, not all\

  contents:
  - "5.1.4.  End-to-End vs. Hop-by-Hop Encryption Tradeoffs in PPVPNs\n   In PPVPNs,\
    \ encryption could potentially be applied to the VPN traffic\n   at several different\
    \ places.  This section discusses some of the\n   tradeoffs in implementing encryption\
    \ in several different connection\n   topologies among different devices within\
    \ a PPVPN.\n   Encryption typically involves a pair of devices that encrypt the\n\
    \   traffic passing between them.  The devices may be directly connected\n   (over\
    \ a single \"hop\"), or there may be intervening devices that\n   transport the\
    \ encrypted traffic between the pair of devices.  The\n   extreme cases involve\
    \ hop-by-hop encryption between every adjacent\n   pair of devices along a given\
    \ path or \"end-to-end\" encryption only\n   between the end devices along a given\
    \ path.  To keep this discussion\n   within the scope of PPVPNs, we consider the\
    \ \"end to end\" case to be\n   CE to CE rather than fully end to end.\n   Figure\
    \ 2 depicts a simplified PPVPN topology, showing the Customer\n   Edge (CE) devices,\
    \ the Provider Edge (PE) devices, and a variable\n   number (three are shown)\
    \ of Provider core (P) devices that might be\n   present along the path between\
    \ two sites in a single VPN, operated by\n   a single service provider (SP).\n\

    \ Figure 2: Simplified PPVPN topology\n   Within this simplified topology and\
    \ assuming that P devices are not\n   to be involved with encryption, there are\
    \ four basic feasible\n   configurations for implementing encryption on connections\
    \ among the\n   devices:\n      1) Site-to-site (CE-to-CE): Encryption can be\
    \ configured between\n         the two CE devices, so that traffic will be encrypted\n\
    \         throughout the SP's network.\n      2) Provider edge-to-edge (PE-to-PE):\
    \ Encryption can be configured\n         between the two PE devices.  Unencrypted\
    \ traffic is received at\n         one PE from the customer's CE; then it is encrypted\
    \ for\n         transmission through the SP's network to the other PE, where it\n\
    \         is decrypted and sent to the other CE.\n      3) Access link (CE-to-PE):\
    \ Encryption can be configured between\n         the CE and PE, on each side (or\
    \ on only one side).\n      4) Configurations 2) and 3) can be combined, with\
    \ encryption\n         running from CE to PE, then from PE to PE, and then from\
    \ PE to\n         CE.\n   Among the four feasible configurations, key tradeoffs\
    \ in considering\n   encryption include the following:\n   -  Vulnerability to\
    \ link eavesdropping: Assuming that an attacker can\n      observe the data in\
    \ transit on the links, would it be protected by\n      encryption?\n   -  Vulnerability\
    \ to device compromise: Assuming an attacker can get\n      access to a device\
    \ (or freely alter its configuration), would the\n      data be protected?\n \
    \  -  Complexity of device configuration and management: Given Nce, the\n    \
    \  number of sites per VPN customer, and Npe, the number of PEs\n      participating\
    \ in a given VPN, how many device configurations have\n      to be created or\
    \ maintained and how do those configurations scale?\n   -  Processing load on\
    \ devices: How many encryption or decryption\n      operations must be done, given\
    \ P packets?  This influences\n      considerations of device capacity and perhaps\
    \ end-to-end delay.\n   -  Ability of SP to provide enhanced services (QoS, firewall,\n\
    \      intrusion detection, etc.): Can the SP inspect the data in order\n    \
    \  to provide these services?\n   These tradeoffs are discussed below for each\
    \ configuration.\n   1) Site-to-site (CE-to-CE) Configurations\n      o  Link\
    \ eavesdropping: Protected on all links.\n      o  Device compromise: Vulnerable\

    \ one device\n         per site (Nce devices), but overall configuration per VPN\n\
    \         scales as Nce**2.\n      o  Processing load: on each of two CEs, each\
    \ packet is either\n         encrypted or decrypted (2P).\n      o  Enhanced services:\
    \ Severely limited; typically only DiffServ\n         markings are visible to\
    \ SP, allowing some QoS services.\n   2) Provider edge-to-edge (PE-to-PE) Configurations\n\
    \      o  Link eavesdropping: Vulnerable on CE-PE links; protected on\n      \
    \   SP's network links.\n      o  Device compromise: Vulnerable to CE or PE compromise.\n\
    \      o  Complexity: Single administration; Npe devices to configure.\n     \
    \    (Multiple sites may share a PE device, so Npe is typically much\n       \
    \  less than Nce.)  Scalability of the overall configuration\n         depends\
    \ on the PPVPN type: If the encryption is separate per\n         VPN context,\
    \ it scales as Npe**2 per customer VPN.  If the\n         encryption is per PE,\
    \ it scales as Npe**2 for all customer VPNs\n         combined.\n      o  Processing\
    \ load: On each of two PEs, each packet is either\n         encrypted or decrypted\
    \ (2P).\n      o  Enhanced services: Full; SP can apply any enhancements based\
    \ on\n         detailed view of traffic.\n   3) Access link (CE-to-PE) Configuration\n\
    \      o  Link eavesdropping: Protected on CE-PE link; vulnerable on SP's\n  \
    \       network links.\n      o  Device compromise: Vulnerable to CE or PE compromise.\n\
    \      o  Complexity: Two administrations (customer and SP) with device\n    \
    \     configuration on each side (Nce + Npe devices to configure),\n         but\
    \ as there is no mesh, the overall configuration scales as\n         Nce.\n  \
    \    o  Processing load: On each of two CEs, each packet is either\n         encrypted\
    \ or decrypted.  On each of two PEs, each packet is\n         either encrypted\
    \ or decrypted (4P).\n      o  Enhanced services: Full; SP can apply any enhancements\
    \ based on\n         detailed view of traffic.\n   4) Combined Access link and\
    \ PE-to-PE (essentially hop-by-hop).\n      o  Link eavesdropping: Protected on\
    \ all links.\n      o  Device compromise: Vulnerable to CE or PE compromise.\n\
    \      o  Complexity: Two administrations (customer and SP), with device\n   \
    \      configuration on each side (Nce + Npe devices to configure).\n        \
    \ Scalability of the overall configuration depends on the PPVPN\n         type.\
    \  If the encryption is separate per VPN context, it scales\n         as Npe**2\
    \ per customer VPN.  If the encryption is per-PE, it\n         scales as Npe**2\
    \ for all customer VPNs combined.\n      o  Processing load: On each of two CEs,\
    \ each packet is either\n         encrypted or decrypted.  On each of two PEs,\
    \ each packet is\n         both encrypted and decrypted (6P).\n      o  Enhanced\
    \ services: Full; SP can apply any enhancements based on\n         detailed view\
    \ of traffic.\n   Given the tradeoffs discussed above, a few conclusions can be\n\
    \   reached.\n   -  Configurations 2 and 3, which are subsets of 4, may be appropriate\n\
    \      alternatives to 4 under certain threat models.  The remainder of\n    \
    \  these conclusions compare 1 (CE-to-CE) with 4 (combined access\n      links\
    \ and PE-to-PE).\n   -  If protection from link eavesdropping is most important,\
    \ then\n      configurations 1 and 4 are equivalent.\n   -  If protection from\
    \ device compromise is most important and the\n      threat is to the CE devices,\
    \ both cases are equivalent; if the\n      threat is to the PE devices, configuration\
    \ 1 is best.\n   -  If reducing complexity is most important and the size of the\n\
    \      network is very small, configuration 1 is the best.  Otherwise,\n     \
    \ the comparison between options 1 and 4 is relatively complex ,\n      based\
    \ on a number of issues such as, how close the CE to CE\n      communication is\
    \ to a full mesh, and what tools are used for key\n      management.  Option 1\
    \ requires configuring keys for each CE-CE\n      pair that is communicating directly.\
    \  Option 4 requires\n      configuring keys on both CE and PE devices but may\
    \ offer benefit\n      from the fact that the number of PEs is generally much\
    \ smaller\n      than the number of CEs.\n      Also, under some PPVPN approaches,\
    \ the scaling of 4 is further\n      improved by sharing the same PE-PE mesh across\
    \ all VPN contexts.\n      The scaling characteristics of 4 may be increased or\
    \ decreased in\n      any given situation if the CE devices are simpler to configure\n\
    \      than the PE devices, or vice versa.  Furthermore, with option 4,\n    \
    \  the impact of operational error may be significantly increased.\n   -  If the\
    \ overall processing load is a key factor, then 1 is best.\n   -  If the availability\
    \ of enhanced services support from the SP is\n      most important, then 4 is\
    \ best.\n   As a quick overall conclusion, CE-to-CE encryption provides greater\n\
    \   protection against device compromise, but it comes at the cost of\n   enhanced\
    \ services and with additional operational complexity due to\n   the Order(n**2)\
    \ scaling of the mesh.\n   This analysis of site-to-site vs. hop-by-hop encryption\
    \ tradeoffs\n   does not explicitly include cases where multiple providers cooperate\n\
    \   to provide a PPVPN service, public Internet VPN connectivity, or\n   remote\

  - "5.2.4.  Authenticating Remote Access VPN Members\n   This section describes methods\
    \ for authentication of remote access\n   users connecting to a VPN.\n   Effective\
    \ authentication of individual connections is a key\n   requirement for enabling\
    \ remote access to a PPVPN from an arbitrary\n   Internet address (for instance,\
    \ by a traveler).\n   There are several widely used standards-based protocols\
    \ to support\n   remote access authentication.  These include RADIUS [RFC2865]\
    \ and\n   DIAMETER [RFC3588].  Digital certificate systems also provide\n   authentication.\
    \  In addition, there has been extensive development\n   and deployment of mechanisms\
    \ for securely transporting individual\n   remote access connections within tunneling\
    \ protocols, including L2TP\n   [RFC2661] and IPsec.\n   Remote access involves\
    \ connection to a gateway device, which provides\n   access to the PPVPN.  The\
    \ gateway device may be managed by the user\n   at a user site, or by the PPVPN\
    \ provider at any of several possible\n   locations in the network.  The user-managed\
    \ case is of limited\n   interest within the PPVPN security framework, and it\
    \ is not\n   considered at this time.\n   When a PPVPN provider manages authentication\
    \ at the remote access\n   gateway, this implies that authentication databases,\
    \ which are\n   usually extremely confidential user-managed systems, will have\
    \ to be\n   referenced in a secure manner by the PPVPN provider.  This can be\n\
    \   accomplished through proxy authentication services, which accept an\n   encrypted\
    \ authentication credential from the remote access user, pass\n   it to the PPVPN\
    \ user's authentication system, and receive a yes/no\n   response as to whether\
    \ the user has been authenticated.  Thus, the\n   PPVPN provider does not have\
    \ access to the actual authentication\n   database, but it can use it on behalf\
    \ of the PPVPN user to provide\n   remote access authentication.\n   Specific\

- title: 5.3.  Access Control Techniques
  contents:
  - "5.3.  Access Control Techniques\n   Access control techniques include packet-by-packet\
    \ or packet flow -\n   by - packet flow access control by means of filters and\
    \ firewalls, as\n   well as by means of admitting a \"session\" for a\n   control/signaling/management\
    \ protocol that is being used to implement\n   PPVPNs.  Enforcement of access\
    \ control by isolated infrastructure\n   addresses is discussed elsewhere in this\
    \ document.\n   We distinguish between filtering and firewalls primarily by the\n\
    \   direction of traffic flow.  We define filtering as being applicable\n   to\
    \ unidirectional traffic, whereas a firewall can analyze and control\n   both\
    \ sides of a conversation.\n   There are two significant corollaries of this definition:\n\
    \   -  Routing or traffic flow symmetry: A firewall typically requires\n     \
    \ routing symmetry, which is usually enforced by locating a firewall\n      where\
    \ the network topology assures that both sides of a\n      conversation will pass\
    \ through the firewall.  A filter can then\n      operate upon traffic flowing\
    \ in one direction without considering\n      traffic in the reverse direction.\n\
    \   -  Statefulness: Because it receives both sides of a conversation, a\n   \
    \   firewall may be able to obtain a significant amount of information\n     \
    \ concerning that conversation and to use this information to\n      control access.\
    \  A filter can maintain some limited state\n      information on a unidirectional\
    \ flow of packets, but it cannot\n      determine the state of the bi-directional\
    \ conversation as\n      precisely as a firewall can.\n"
- title: 5.3.1.  Filtering
  contents:
  - "5.3.1.  Filtering\n   It is relatively common for routers to filter data packets.\
    \  That is,\n   routers can look for particular values in certain fields of the\
    \ IP or\n   higher level (e.g., TCP or UDP) headers.  Packets that match the\n\
    \   criteria associated with a particular filter may be either discarded\n   or\
    \ given special treatment.\n   In discussing filters, it is useful to separate\
    \ the filter\n   characteristics that may be used to determine whether a packet\n\
    \   matches a filter from the packet actions that are applied to packets\n   that\
    \ match a particular filter.\n   o  Filter Characteristics\n      Filter characteristics\
    \ are used to determine whether a particular\n      packet or set of packets matches\
    \ a particular filter.\n      In many cases, filter characteristics may be stateless.\
    \  A\n      stateless filter determines whether a particular packet matches a\n\
    \      filter based solely on the filter definition, on normal forwarding\n  \
    \    information (such as the next hop for a packet), and on the\n      characteristics\
    \ of that individual packet.  Typically, stateless\n      filters may consider\
    \ the incoming and outgoing logical or physical\n      interface, information\
    \ in the IP header, and information in higher\n      layer headers such as the\
    \ TCP or UDP header.  Information in the\n      IP header to be considered may,\
    \ for example, include source and\n      destination IP address, Protocol field,\
    \ Fragment Offset, and TOS\n      field.  Filters may also consider fields in\
    \ the TCP or UDP header\n      such as the Port fields and the SYN field in the\
    \ TCP header.\n      Stateful filtering maintains packet-specific state information\
    \ to\n      aid in determining whether a filter has been met.  For example, a\n\
    \      device might apply stateless filters to the first fragment of a\n     \
    \ fragmented IP packet.  If the filter matches, then the data unit\n      ID may\
    \ be remembered, and other fragments of the same packet may\n      then be considered\
    \ to match the same filter.  Stateful filtering\n      is more commonly done in\
    \ firewalls, although firewall technology\n      may be added to routers.\n  \
    \ o  Actions Based on Filter Results\n      If a packet, or a series of packets,\
    \ match a specific filter, then\n      there are a variety of actions that may\
    \ be taken based on that\n      filter match.  Examples of such actions include:\n\
    \      -  Discard\n         In many cases, filters may be set to catch certain\
    \ undesirable\n         packets.  Examples may include packets with forged or\
    \ invalid\n         source addresses, packets that are part of a DoS or DDoS\n\
    \         attack, or packets that are trying to access forbidden\n         resources\
    \ (such as network management packets from an\n         unauthorized source).\
    \  Where such filters are activated, it is\n         common to silently discard\
    \ the packet or set of packets\n         matching the filter.  The discarded packets\
    \ may also be counted\n         and/or logged, of course.\n      -  Set CoS\n\
    \         A filter may be used to set the Class of Service associated\n      \
    \   with the packet.\n      -  Count Packets and/or Bytes\n      -  Rate Limit\n\
    \         In some cases, the set of packets that match a particular\n        \
    \ filter may be limited to a specified bandwidth.  Packets and/or\n         bytes\
    \ would be counted and forwarded normally up to the\n         specified limit.\
    \  Excess packets may be discarded or marked\n         (for example, by setting\
    \ a \"discard eligible\" bit in the IP ToS\n         field or the MPLS EXP field).\n\
    \      -  Forward and Copy\n         It is useful in some cases not only to forward\
    \ some set of\n         packets normally, but also to send a copy to a specified\
    \ other\n         address or interface.  For example, this may be used to\n  \
    \       implement a lawful intercept capability, or to feed selected\n       \
    \  packets to an Intrusion Detection System.\n   o  Other Issues Related to Packet\
    \ Filters\n      There may be a very wide variation in the performance impact\
    \ of\n      filtering.  This may occur both due to differences between\n     \
    \ implementations, and due to differences between types or numbers\n      of filters\
    \ deployed.  For filtering to be useful, the performance\n      of the equipment\
    \ has to be acceptable in the presence of filters.\n      The precise definition\
    \ of \"acceptable\" may vary from service\n      provider to service provider\
    \ and may depend on the intended use of\n      the filters.  For example, for\
    \ some uses a filter may be turned on\n      all the time in order to set CoS,\
    \ to prevent an attack, or to\n      mitigate the effect of a possible future\
    \ attack.  In this case it\n      is likely that the service provider will want\
    \ the filter to have\n      minimal or no impact on performance.  In other cases,\
    \ a filter may\n      be turned on only in response to a major attack (such as\
    \ a major\n      DDoS attack).  In this case a greater performance impact may\
    \ be\n      acceptable to some service providers.\n      A key consideration with\
    \ the use of packet filters is that they\n      can provide few options for filtering\
    \ packets carrying encrypted\n      data.  Because the data itself is not accessible,\
    \ only packet\n      header information or other unencrypted fields can be used\
    \ for\n      filtering.\n"
- title: 5.3.2.  Firewalls
  contents:
  - "5.3.2.  Firewalls\n   Firewalls provide a mechanism for control over traffic\
    \ passing\n   between different trusted zones in the PPVPN model, or between a\n\
    \   trusted zone and an untrusted zone.  Firewalls typically provide much\n  \
    \ more functionality than filters, as they may be able to apply\n   detailed analysis\
    \ and logical functions to flows and not just to\n   individual packets.  They\
    \ may offer a variety of complex services,\n   such as threshold-driven denial-of-service\
    \ attack protection, virus\n   scanning, or acting as a TCP connection proxy.\
    \  As with other access\n   control techniques, the value of firewalls depends\
    \ on a clear\n   understanding of the topologies of the PPVPN core network, the\
    \ user\n   networks, and the threat model.  Their effectiveness depends on a\n\
    \   topology with a clearly defined inside (secure) and outside (not\n   secure).\n\
    \   Within the PPVPN framework, traffic typically is not allowed to pass\n   between\
    \ the various user VPNs.  This inter-VPN isolation is usually\n   not performed\
    \ by a firewall, but it is a part of the basic VPN\n   mechanism.  An exception\
    \ to the total isolation of VPNs is the case\n   of \"extranets\", which allow\
    \ specific external access to a user's VPN,\n   potentially from another VPN.\
    \  Firewalls can be used to provide the\n   services required for secure extranet\
    \ implementation.\n   In a PPVPN, firewalls can be applied between the public\
    \ Internet and\n   user VPNs, in cases where Internet access services are offered\
    \ by the\n   provider to the VPN user sites.  In addition, firewalls may be\n\
    \   applied between VPN user sites and any shared network-based services\n   offered\
    \ by the PPVPN provider.\n   Firewalls may be applied to help protect PPVPN core\
    \ network functions\n   from attacks originating from the Internet or from PPVPN\
    \ user sites,\n   but typically other defensive techniques will be used for this\n\
    \   purpose.\n   Where firewalls are employed as a service to protect user VPN\
    \ sites\n   from the Internet, different VPN users, and even different sites of\
    \ a\n   single VPN user, may have varying firewall requirements.  The overall\n\
    \   PPVPN logical and physical topology, along with the capabilities of\n   the\
    \ devices implementing the firewall services, will have a\n   significant effect\
    \ on the feasibility and manageability of such\n   varied firewall service offerings.\n\
    \   Another consideration with the use of firewalls is that they can\n   provide\
    \ few options for handling packets carrying encrypted data.  As\n   the data itself\
    \ is not accessible, only packet header information,\n   other unencrypted fields,\
    \ or analysis of the flow of encrypted\n   packets can be used for making decisions\
    \ on accepting or rejecting\n   encrypted traffic.\n"

- title: 5.5.  Use of Aggregated Infrastructure

  - "5.5.  Use of Aggregated Infrastructure\n   In general it is not feasible to use\
    \ a completely separate set of\n   resources for support of each VPN.  One of\
    \ the main reasons for VPN\n   services is to allow sharing of resources between\
    \ multiple users,\n   including multiple VPNs.  Thus, even if VPN services make\
    \ use of a\n   separate network from Internet services, there will still be multiple\n\
    \   VPN users sharing the same network resources.  In some cases, VPN\n   services\
    \ will share the use of network resources with Internet\n   services or other\
    \ services.\n   It is therefore important for VPN services to provide protection\n\
    \   between resource use by different VPNs.  Thus, a well-behaved VPN\n   user\
    \ should be protected from possible misbehavior by other VPNs.\n   This requires\
    \ that limits be placed on the amount of resources that\n   can be used by any\
    \ one VPN.  For example, both control traffic and\n   user data traffic may be\
    \ rate limited.  In some cases or in some\n   parts of the network where a sufficiently\
    \ large number of queues are\n   available, each VPN (and, optionally, each VPN\
    \ and CoS within the\n   VPN) may make use of a separate queue.  Control-plane\
    \ resources such\n   as link bandwidth and CPU and memory resources may be reserved\
    \ on a\n   per-VPN basis.\n   The techniques that are used to provision resource\
    \ protection between\n   multiple VPNs served by the same infrastructure can also\
    \ be used to\n   protect VPN services from Internet services.\n   The use of aggregated\
    \ infrastructure allows the service provider to\n   benefit from stochastic multiplexing\

  - "6.  Monitoring, Detection, and Reporting of Security Attacks\n   A PPVPN service\
    \ may be subject to attacks from a variety of security\n   threats.  Many threats\
    \ are described in another part of this\n   document.  Many of the defensive techniques\
    \ described in this\n   document and elsewhere provide significant levels of protection\
    \ from\n   a variety of threats.  However, in addition to silently employing\n\
    \   defensive techniques to protect against attacks, PPVPN services can\n   add\
    \ value for both providers and customers by implementing security-\n   monitoring\
    \ systems that detect and report on any security attacks\n   that occur, regardless\
    \ of whether the attacks are effective.\n   Attackers often begin by probing and\
    \ analyzing defenses, so systems\n   that can detect and properly report these\
    \ early stages of attacks can\n   provide significant benefits.\n   Information\
    \ concerning attack incidents, especially if available\n   quickly, can be useful\
    \ in defending against further attacks.  It can\n   be used to help identify attackers\
    \ and their specific targets at an\n   early stage.  This knowledge about attackers\
    \ and targets can be used\n   to further strengthen defenses against specific\
    \ attacks or attackers,\n   or to improve the defensive services for specific\
    \ targets on an as-\n   needed basis.  Information collected on attacks may also\
    \ be useful in\n   identifying and developing defenses against novel attack types.\n\
    \   Monitoring systems used to detect security attacks in PPVPNs will\n   typically\
    \ operate by collecting information from Provider Edge (PE),\n   Customer Edge\
    \ (CE), and/or Provider backbone (P) devices.  Security\n   monitoring systems\
    \ should have the ability to actively retrieve\n   information from devices (e.g.,\
    \ SNMP get) or to passively receive\n   reports from devices (e.g., SNMP notifications).\
    \  The specific\n   information exchanged will depend on the capabilities of the\
    \ devices\n   and on the type of VPN technology.  Particular care should be given\n\
    \   to securing the communications channel between the monitoring systems\n  \
    \ and the PPVPN devices.\n   The CE, PE, and P devices should employ efficient\
    \ methods to acquire\n   and communicate the information needed by the security\
    \ monitoring\n   systems.  It is important that the communication method between\
    \ PPVPN\n   devices and security monitoring systems be designed so that it will\n\
    \   not disrupt network operations.  As an example, multiple attack\n   events\
    \ may be reported through a single message, rather than allow\n   each attack\
    \ event to trigger a separate message, which might result\n   in a flood of messages,\
    \ essentially becoming a denial-of-service\n   attack against the monitoring system\
    \ or the network.\n   The mechanisms for reporting security attacks should be\

  contents:
  - "7.  User Security Requirements\n   This section defines a list of security-related\
    \ requirements that the\n   users of PPVPN services may have for their PPVPN service.\
    \  Typically,\n   these translate into requirements for the provider in offering\
    \ the\n   service.\n   The following sections detail various requirements that\
    \ ensure the\n   security of a given trusted zone.  Since in real life there are\n\
    \   various levels of security, a PPVPN may fulfill any or all of these\n   security\
    \ requirements.  This document does not state that a PPVPN\n   must fulfill all\
    \ of these requirements to be secure.  As mentioned in\n   the Introduction, it\
    \ is not within the scope of this document to\n   define the specific requirements\
    \ that each VPN technology must\n   fulfill in order to be secure.\n"
- title: 7.1.  Isolation
  contents:
  - "7.1.  Isolation\n   A virtual private network usually defines \"private\" as\
    \ isolation from\n   other PPVPNs and the Internet.  More specifically, isolation\
    \ has\n   several components, which are discussed in the following sections.\n"
- title: 7.1.1.  Address Separation
  contents:
  - "7.1.1.  Address Separation\n   A given PPVPN can use the full Internet address\
    \ range, including\n   private address ranges [RFC1918], without interfering with\
    \ other\n   PPVPNs that use PPVPN services from the same service provider(s).\n\
    \   When Internet access is provided (e.g., by the same service provider\n   that\
    \ is offering PPVPN service), NAT functionality may be needed.\n   In layer-2\
    \ VPNs, the same requirement exists for the layer 2\n   addressing schemes, such\
    \ as MAC addresses.\n"
- title: 7.1.2.  Routing Separation
  contents:
  - "7.1.2.  Routing Separation\n   A PPVPN core must maintain routing separation\
    \ between the trusted\n   zones.  This means that routing information must not\
    \ leak from any\n   trusted zone to any other, unless the zones are specifically\n\
    \   engineered this way (e.g., for Internet access.)\n   In layer-2 VPNs, the\
    \ switching information must be kept separate\n   between the trusted zones, so\
    \ that switching information of one PPVPN\n   does not influence other PPVPNs\
    \ or the PPVPN core.\n"
- title: 7.1.3.  Traffic Separation
  contents:
  - "7.1.3.  Traffic Separation\n   Traffic from a given trusted zone must never leave\
    \ this zone, and\n   traffic from another zone must never enter this zone.  Exceptions\
    \ are\n   made where zones are is specifically engineered that way (e.g., for\n\
    \   extranet purposes or Internet access.)\n"
- title: 7.2.  Protection
  contents:
  - "7.2.  Protection\n   The common perception is that a completely separated \"\
    private\"\n   network has defined entry points and is only subject to attack or\n\
    \   intrusion over those entry points.  By sharing a common core, a PPVPN\n  \
    \ appears to lose some of these clear interfaces to networks outside\n   the trusted\
    \ zone.  Thus, one of the key security requirements of\n   PPVPN services is that\
    \ they offer the same level of protection as\n   private networks.\n"
- title: 7.2.1.  Protection against Intrusion
  contents:
  - "7.2.1.  Protection against Intrusion\n   An intrusion is defined here as the\
    \ penetration of a trusted zone\n   from outside.  This could be from the Internet,\
    \ another PPVPN, or the\n   core network itself.\n   The fact that a network is\
    \ \"virtual\" must not expose it to additional\n   threats over private networks.\
    \  Specifically, it must not add new\n   interfaces to other parts outside the\
    \ trusted zone.  Intrusions from\n   known interfaces such as Internet gateways\
    \ are outside the scope of\n   this document.\n"
- title: 7.2.2.  Protection against Denial-of-Service Attacks
  contents:
  - "7.2.2.  Protection against Denial-of-Service Attacks\n   A denial-of-service\
    \ (DoS) attack aims at making services or devices\n   unavailable to legitimate\
    \ users.  In the framework of this document,\n   only those DoS attacks are considered\
    \ that are a consequence of\n   providing network service through a VPN.  DoS\
    \ attacks over the\n   standard interfaces into a trusted zone are not considered\
    \ here.\n   The requirement is that a PPVPN is not more vulnerable against DoS\n\
    \   attacks than it would be if the same network were private.\n"
- title: 7.2.3.  Protection against Spoofing
  contents:
  - "7.2.3.  Protection against Spoofing\n   It must not be possible to violate the\
    \ integrity of a PPVPN by\n   changing the sender identification (source address,\
    \ source label,\n   etc) of traffic in transit.  For example, if two CEs are connected\
    \ to\n   the same PE, it must not be possible for one CE to send crafted\n   packets\
    \ that make the PE believe those packets are coming from the\n   other CE, thus\
    \ inserting them into the wrong PPVPN.\n"
- title: 7.3.  Confidentiality
  contents:
  - "7.3.  Confidentiality\n   This requirement means that data must be cryptographically\
    \ secured in\n   transit over the PPVPN core network to avoid eavesdropping.\n"
- title: 7.4.  CE Authentication
  contents:
  - "7.4.  CE Authentication\n   Where CE authentication is provided, it is not possible\
    \ for an\n   outsider to install a CE and pretend to belong to a specific PPVPN\
    \ to\n   which this CE does not belong in reality.\n"
- title: 7.5.  Integrity
  contents:
  - "7.5.  Integrity\n   Data in transit must be secured in such a manner that it\
    \ cannot be\n   altered or that any alteration may be detected at the receiver.\n"
- title: 7.6.  Anti-replay
  contents:
  - "7.6.  Anti-replay\n   Anti-replay means that data in transit cannot be recorded\
    \ and\n   replayed later.  To protect against anti-replay attacks, the data\n\
    \   must be cryptographically secured.\n   Note: Even private networks do not\
    \ necessarily meet the requirements\n   of confidentiality, integrity, and anti-reply.\
    \  Thus, when private\n   and \"virtually private\" PPVPN services are compared,\
    \ these\n   requirements are only applicable if the comparable private service\n\
    \   also included these services.  However, the fact that VPNs operate\n   over\
    \ a shared infrastructure may make some of these requirements more\n   important\
    \ in a VPN environment than in a private network environment.\n"
- title: 8.  Provider Security Requirements
  contents:
  - "8.  Provider Security Requirements\n   In this section, we discuss additional\
    \ security requirements that the\n   provider may have in order to secure its\
    \ network infrastructure as it\n   provides PPVPN services.\n   The PPVPN service\
    \ provider requirements defined here are the\n   requirements for the PPVPN core\
    \ in the reference model.  The core\n   network can be implemented with different\
    \ types of network\n   technologies, and each core network may use different technologies\
    \ to\n   provide the PPVPN services to users with different levels of offered\n\
    \   security.  Therefore, a PPVPN service provider may fulfill any number\n  \
    \ of the security requirements listed in this section. This document\n   does\
    \ not state that a PPVPN must fulfill all of these requirements to\n   be secure.\n\
    \   These requirements are focused on 1) how to protect the PPVPN core\n   from\
    \ various attacks outside the core, including PPVPN users and\n   non-PPVPN alike,\
    \ both accidentally and maliciously, and 2) how to\n   protect the PPVPN user\
    \ VPNs and sites themselves.  Note that a PPVPN\n   core is not more vulnerable\
    \ against attacks than a core that does not\n   provide PPVPNs.  However, providing\
    \ PPVPN services over such a core\n   may lead to additional security requirements,\
    \ if only because most\n   users are expecting higher security standards in a\
    \ core delivering\n   PPVPN services.\n"

  contents:
  - "8.1.1.  Control Plane Protection\n   -  Protocol Authentication within the Core:\n\
    \      PPVPN technologies and infrastructure must support mechanisms for\n   \
    \   authentication of the control plane.  For an IP core, IGP and BGP\n      sessions\
    \ may be authenticated by using TCP MD5 or IPsec.  If an\n      MPLS core is used,\
    \ LDP sessions may be authenticated by using TCP\n      MD5.  In addition, IGP\
    \ and BGP authentication should also be\n      considered.  For a core providing\
    \ layer-2 services, PE to PE\n      authentication may also be used via IPsec.\n\
    \      With the cost of authentication coming down rapidly, the\n      application\
    \ of control plane authentication may not increase the\n      cost of implementation\
    \ for providers significantly, and it will\n      improve the security of the\
    \ core.  If the core is dedicated to VPN\n      services and there are no interconnects\
    \ to third parties, then it\n      may reduce the requirement for authentication\
    \ of the core control\n      plane.\n   -  Elements protection\n      Here we\
    \ discuss means to hide the provider's infrastructure nodes.\n      A PPVPN provider\
    \ may make the infrastructure routers (P and PE\n      routers) unreachable by\
    \ outside users and unauthorized internal\n      users.  For example, separate\
    \ address space may be used for the\n      infrastructure loopbacks.\n      Normal\
    \ TTL propagation may be altered to make the backbone look\n      like one hop\
    \ from the outside, but caution should be taken for\n      loop prevention.  This\
    \ prevents the backbone addresses from being\n      exposed through trace route;\
    \ however, it must also be assessed\n      against operational requirements for\
    \ end-to-end fault tracing.\n      An Internet backbone core may be re-engineered\
    \ to make Internet\n      routing an edge function, for example, by using MPLS\
    \ label\n      switching for all traffic within the core and possibly by making\n\
    \      the Internet a VPN within the PPVPN core itself.  This helps\n      detach\
    \ Internet access from PPVPN services.\n      PE devices may implement separate\
    \ control plane, data plane, and\n      management plane functionality in terms\
    \ of hardware and software,\n      to improve security.  This may help limit the\
    \ problems when one\n      particular area is attacked, and it may allow each\
    \ plane to\n      implement additional security measurement separately.\n    \
    \  PEs are often more vulnerable to attack than P routers, since, by\n      their\
    \ very nature, PEs cannot be made unreachable to outside\n      users.  Access\
    \ to core trunk resources can be controlled on a\n      per-user basis by the\
    \ application of inbound rate-\n      limiting/shaping.  This can be further enhanced\
    \ on a per-Class of\n      Service basis (see section 8.2.3).\n      In the PE,\
    \ using separate routing processes for Internet and PPVPN\n      service may help\
    \ improve the PPVPN security and better protect VPN\n      customers.  Furthermore,\
    \ if the resources, such as CPU and memory,\n      may be further separated based\
    \ on applications, or even on\n      individual VPNs, it may help provide improved\
    \ security and\n      reliability to individual VPN customers.\n      Many of\
    \ these were not particular issues when an IP core was\n      designed to support\
    \ Internet services only.  Providing PPVPN\n      services introduces new security\
    \ requirements for VPN services.\n      Similar consideration apply to L2 VPN\
    \ services.\n"

  - "10.  Security Considerations\n   Security considerations constitute the sole\
    \ subject of this memo and\n   hence are discussed throughout.  Here we recap\
    \ what has been\n   presented and explain at a very high level the role of each\
    \ type of\n   consideration in an overall secure PPVPN system.  The document\n\
    \   describes a number of potential security threats.  Some of these\n   threats\
    \ have already been observed occurring in running networks;\n   others are largely\
    \ theoretical at this time.\n   DoS attacks and intrusion attacks from the Internet\
    \ against service\n   provider infrastructure have been seen.  DoS \"attacks\"\
    \ (typically not\n   malicious) have also been seen in which CE equipment overwhelms\
    \ PE\n   equipment with high quantities or rates of packet traffic or routing\n\
    \   information.  Operational/provisioning errors are cited by service\n   providers\
    \ as one of their prime concerns.\n   The document describes a variety of defensive\
    \ techniques that may be\n   used to counter the suspected threats.  All of the\
    \ techniques\n   presented involve mature and widely implemented technologies\
    \ that are\n   practical to implement.\n   The document describes the importance\
    \ of detecting, monitoring, and\n   reporting both successful and unsuccessful\
    \ attacks.  These activities\n   are essential for \"understanding one's enemy\"\
    , mobilizing new\n   defenses, and obtaining metrics about how secure the PPVPN\
    \ service\n   is.  As such, they are vital components of any complete PPVPN\n\
    \   security system.\n   The document evaluates PPVPN security requirements from\
    \ a customer\n   perspective and from a service provider perspective.  These sections\n\
    \   re-evaluate the identified threats from the perspectives of the\n   various\
    \ stakeholders and are meant to assist equipment vendors and\n   service providers,\
    \ who must ultimately decide what threats to protect\n   against in any given\
    \ equipment or service offering.\n   Finally, the document includes a template\
    \ for use by authors of PPVPN\n   technical solutions for evaluating how those\
    \ solutions measure up\n   against the security considerations presented in this\
    \ memo.\n"
