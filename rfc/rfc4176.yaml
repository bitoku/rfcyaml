- title: 1.1.  Terminology
  contents:
  - "1.1.  Terminology\n   In this document, the following terms are used and defined\
    \ as\n   follows:\n   VPN:\n      Virtual Private Network.  A set of transmission\
    \ and switching\n      resources that will be used over a shared infrastructure\
    \ to\n      process the (IP) traffic that characterizes communication services\n\
    \      between the sites or premises interconnected via this VPN.  See\n     \
    \ [RFC4026].\n   L3VPN:\n      An L3VPN interconnects sets of hosts and routers\
    \ based on Layer 3\n      addresses.  See [RFC4026].\n   VPN Instance:\n     \
    \ From a management standpoint, a VPN instance is the collection of\n      configuration\
    \ information associated with a specific VPN, residing\n      on a PE router.\n\
    \   VPN Site:\n      A VPN customer's location that is connected to the Service\n\
    \      Provider network via a CE-PE link, which can access at least one\n    \
    \  VPN.\n   VPN Service Provider (SP):\n      A Service Provider that offers VPN-related\
    \ services.\n   VPN Customer:\n      Refers to a customer that bought VPNs from\
    \ a VPN service provider.\n   Customer Agent:\n      Denotes the entity that is\
    \ responsible for requesting VPN\n      customer-specific information.\n   Service\
    \ Level Agreement(SLA):\n      Contractual agreement between the Service Provider\
    \ and Customer,\n      which includes qualitative and quantitative metrics that\
    \ define\n      service quality guarantees and retribution procedures when service\n\
    \      levels are not being met.\n   Service Level Specifications (SLS):\n   \
    \   Internally-focused service performance specifications used by the\n      Service\
    \ Provider to manage customer service quality levels.\n"
- title: 1.2.  Management functions
  contents:
  - "1.2.  Management functions\n   For any type of Layer-3 VPN (PE or CE-based VPNs),\
    \ having a\n   management platform where the VPN-related information could be\n\
    \   collected and managed is recommended.  The Service and Network\n   Management\
    \ System may centralize information related to instances of\n   a VPN and allow\
    \ users to configure and provision each instance from a\n   central location.\n\
    \   An SP must be able to manage the capabilities and characteristics of\n   their\
    \ VPN services.  Customers should have means to ensure\n   fulfillment of the\
    \ VPN service to which they subscribed.  To the\n   extent possible, automated\
    \ operations and interoperability with\n   standard management protocols should\
    \ be supported.\n   Two main management functions are identified:\n   A customer\
    \ service management function:\n      This function provides the means for a customer\
    \ to query,\n      configure, and receive (events/alarms) customer-specific VPN\n\
    \      service information.  Customer-specific information includes data\n   \
    \   related to contact, billing, site, access network, IP address,\n      routing\
    \ protocol parameters, etc.  It may also include\n      confidential data, such\
    \ as encryption keys.  Several solutions\n      could be used:\n      *  Proprietary\
    \ network management system\n      *  SNMP manager\n      *  PDP function\n  \
    \    *  Directory service, etc.\n   A provider network management function:\n\
    \      This function is responsible for planning, building, provisioning,\n  \
    \    and maintaining network resources in order to meet the VPN\n      service-level\
    \ agreements outlined in the SLA offered to the\n      customer.  This mainly\
    \ consists of (1) setup and configuration of\n      physical links, (2) provisioning\
    \ of logical VPN service\n      configurations, and (3) life-cycle management\
    \ of VPN service,\n      including the addition, modification, and deletion of\
    \ VPN\n      configurations.\n      There may be relationships between the customer\
    \ service and\n      provider network management functions, as the provider network\
    \ is\n      managed to support/realize/provide the customer service.  One\n  \
    \    example use of this relationship is to provide the VPN-SLS\n      assurance\
    \ for verifying the fulfillment of the subscribed VPN\n      agreement.\n"

- title: 2.  Customer Service Operations and Management
  contents:
  - "2.  Customer Service Operations and Management\n   Services offered by providers\
    \ can be viewed from the customer's or\n   the provider's perspective.  This section\
    \ describes service\n   management from the customer's perspective, focusing on\
    \ the Customer\n   Management function.\n   The Customer Management function's\
    \ goal is to manage the\n   service-based operations like service ordering, service\
    \ subscription,\n   activation, etc.\n   The Customer Management function resides\
    \ in the L3VPN service manager\n   at the Service Management Layer (SML).  It\
    \ mainly consists of\n   defining the L3VPN services offered by the SP, collecting\
    \ and\n   consolidating the customer L3VPN services requirements, as well as\n\
    \   performing some reporting for the customer.  This function is\n   correlated\
    \ with the Network Management function at the Network\n   Management Layer (NML)\
    \ for initiating the L3VPN services\n   provisioning, and getting some service\
    \ reporting.\n"
- title: 2.1.  Customer Service Management Information Model
  contents:
  - "2.1.  Customer Service Management Information Model\n   This section presents\
    \ a framework that is used for L3VPN customer\n   service management at the SML.\
    \  The information framework represents\n   the data that need to be managed,\
    \ and the way they are represented.\n   At the SML, the information framework\
    \ that is foreseen is composed of\n   Service Level Agreements (SLA) and Service\
    \ Level Specifications\n   (SLS).\n   Services are described through Service Level\
    \ Agreements (SLA), which\n   are contractual documents between customers and\
    \ service providers.\n   The technical part of the service description is called\
    \ the Service\n   Level Specification (SLS).  The SLS groups different kinds of\n\
    \   parameters.  Some are more related to the description of the\n   transport\
    \ of the packets, and some to the specification of the\n   service itself.\n \
    \  A Service Level Specification (SLS) may be defined per access network\n   connection,\
    \ per VPN, per VPN site, and/or per VPN route.  The service\n   provider may define\
    \ objectives and the measurement intervals, for at\n   least the SLS, using the\
    \ following Service Level Objective (SLO)\n   parameters:\n   o  QoS and traffic\
    \ parameters\n   o  Availability for the site, VPN, or access connection\n   o\
    \  Duration of outage intervals per site, route, or VPN\n   o  Service activation\
    \ interval (e.g., time to turn up a new site)\n   o  Trouble report response time\
    \ interval\n   o  Time to repair interval\n   o  Total incoming/outgoing traffic\
    \ from a site or a (VPN) route, or\n      that has transited through the whole\
    \ VPN\n   o  Measurement of non-conforming incoming/outgoing traffic\n      (compliance\
    \ of traffic should deserve some elaboration because of\n      many perspectives\
    \ - security, QoS, routing, etc.) from a site or a\n      (VPN) route, or that\
    \ has transited through the whole VPN\n   The service provider and the customer\
    \ may negotiate contractual\n   penalties in the case(s) where the provider does\
    \ not meet a (set of)\n   SLS performance objective(s).\n   Traffic parameters\
    \ and actions should be defined for incoming and\n   outgoing packets that go\
    \ through the demarcation between the service\n   provider premises and the customer's\
    \ premises.  For example, traffic\n   policing functions may be activated at the\
    \ ingress of the service\n   provider's network, while traffic shaping capabilities\
    \ could be\n   activated at the egress of the service provider's network.\n"
- title: 2.2.  Customer Management Functions
  contents:
  - "2.2.  Customer Management Functions\n   This section presents detailed customer\
    \ management functions in the\n   traditional fault, configuration, accounting,\
    \ performance, and\n   security (FCAPS) management categories.\n"
- title: 2.2.1.  Fault Management
  contents:
  - "2.2.1.  Fault Management\n   The fault management function of the Customer Service\
    \ Manager relies\n   upon the manipulation of network layer failure information,\
    \ and it\n   reports incidents to the impacted customers.  Such reports should\
    \ be\n   based upon and related to the VPN service offering to which the\n   customer\
    \ is subscribed.  The Customer Management function support for\n   fault management\
    \ includes:\n   o  Indication of customer's services impacted by failure\n   o\
    \  Incident recording or logs\n   o  Frequency of tests\n   o  Ability to invoke\
    \ probes from the customer and provider\n   o  Ability to uncover faults before\
    \ the customer notices them\n"
- title: 2.2.2.  Configuration Management
  contents:
  - "2.2.2.  Configuration Management\n   The configuration management function of\
    \ the Customer Manager must be\n   able to configure L3VPN service parameters\
    \ with the level of detail\n   that the customer is able to specify, according\
    \ to service templates\n   defined by the provider.\n   A service template contains\
    \ fields which, when instantiated, yield a\n   definite service requirement or\
    \ policy.  For example, a template for\n   an IPsec tunnel [RFC2401] would contain\
    \ fields such as tunnel end\n   points, authentication modes, encryption and authentication\n\
    \   algorithms, shared keys (if any), and traffic filters.\n   Other examples:\
    \ a BGP/MPLS-based VPN service template would contain\n   fields such as the customer\
    \ premises that need to be interconnected\n   via the VPN, and a QoS agreement\
    \ template would contain fields such\n   as one-way transit delay, inter-packet\
    \ delay variation, throughput,\n   and packet loss thresholds.\n"
- title: 2.2.3.  Accounting
  contents:
  - "2.2.3.  Accounting\n   The accounting management function of the Customer Manager\
    \ is\n   provided with network layer measurements information and manages this\n\
    \   information.  The Customer Manager is responsible for the following\n   accounting\
    \ functions:\n   o  Retrieval of accounting information from the Provider Network\n\
    \      Manager\n   o  Analysis, storage, and administration of measurements\n\
    \   Some providers may require near-real time reporting of measurement\n   information,\
    \ and may offer this as part of a customer network\n   management service.\n \
    \  If an SP supports \"Dynamic Bandwidth Management\" service, then the\n   schedule\
    \ and the amount of the bandwidth required to perform\n   requested bandwidth\
    \ allocation change(s) must be traceable for\n   monitoring and accounting purposes.\n\
    \   Solutions should state compliance with accounting requirements, as\n   described\
    \ in section 1.7 of [RFC2975].\n"
- title: 2.2.4.  Performance Management
  contents:
  - "2.2.4.  Performance Management\n   From the Customer Manager's perspective, performance\
    \ management\n   includes functions involved in the determination of the conformance\n\
    \   level with the Service Level Specifications, such as QoS and\n   availability\
    \ measurements.  The objective is to correlate accounting\n   information with\
    \ performance and fault management information to\n   produce billing that takes\
    \ into account SLA provisions for periods of\n   time where the service level\
    \ objectives are not met.\n   The performance information should reflect the quality\
    \ of the\n   subscribed VPN service as perceived by the customer.  This\n   information\
    \ could be measured by the provider or controlled by a\n   third party.  The parameters\
    \ that will be used to reflect the\n   performance level could be negotiated and\
    \ agreed upon between the\n   service provider and the customer during the VPN\
    \ service negotiation\n   phase.\n   Performance management should also support\
    \ analysis of important\n   aspects of an L3VPN, such as bandwidth utilization,\
    \ response time,\n   availability, QoS statistics, and trends based on collected\
    \ data.\n"

    \ the VPN\n   operational status, the VPN service ordering status, the VPN service\n\
    \   handling, the VPN service activation status, and other aspects\n   associated\
    \ with each customer's VPN.\n   From a provider's perspective, the management\
    \ of a VPN service\n   consists mainly of:\n   o  Managing the customers (the\
    \ term \"customer\" denotes a role rather\n      than the end user, thus an SP\
    \ could be a customer) and end-users\n      in terms of SLA\n   o  Managing the\
    \ VPN premises (especially creating, modifying, and\n      deleting operations,\
    \ editing the related information to a specific\n      link, or supervising the\
    \ AAA [RFC2903] [RFC2906] operations)\n   o  Managing the CE-PE links (particularly\

    \ Service, in\n      terms of supported classes of service, traffic isolation,\
    \ etc.\n   Currently, proprietary methods are often used to manage VPNs.  The\n\
    \   additional expense associated with operators having to use multiple,\n   proprietary,\
    \ configuration-related management methods (e.g., Command\n   Line Interface (CLI)\
    \ languages) to access such systems is not\n   recommended, because it affects\
    \ the overall cost of the service\n   (including the exploitation costs), especially\
    \ when multiple vendor\n   technologies (hence multiple expertise) are used to\
    \ support the VPN\n   service offering.  Therefore, devices should provide standards-based\n\
    \   interfaces.  From this perspective, additional requirements on\n   possible\
