- title: 1. The Network Management Framework
  contents:
  - "1. The Network Management Framework\n   The Internet-standard Network Management\
    \ Framework consists of three\n   components.  They are:\n      STD 16/RFC 1155\
    \ which defines the SMI, the mechanisms used for\n      describing and naming\
    \ objects for the purpose of management.  STD\n      16/RFC 1212 defines a more\
    \ concise description mechanism, which is\n      wholly consistent with the SMI.\n\
    \      RFC 1156 which defines MIB-I, the core set of managed objects for\n   \
    \   the Internet suite of protocols.  STD 17/RFC 1213 defines MIB-II,\n      an\
    \ evolution of MIB-I based on implementation experience and new\n      operational\
    \ requirements.\n      STD 15/RFC 1157 which defines the SNMP, the protocol used\
    \ for\n      network access to managed objects.\n   The Framework permits new\
    \ objects to be defined for the purpose of\n   experimentation and evaluation.\n"
- title: 2. Objects
  contents:
  - "2. Objects\n   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store,\
    \ termed\n   the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are\n\
    \   defined using the subset of Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1) [7]\n   defined\
    \ in the SMI.  In particular, each object has a name, a syntax,\n   and an encoding.\
    \  The name is an object identifier, an\n   administratively assigned name, which\
    \ specifies an object type.  The\n   object type together with an object instance\
    \ serves to uniquely\n   identify a specific instantiation of the object.  For\
    \ human\n   convenience, we often use a textual string, termed the OBJECT\n  \
    \ DESCRIPTOR, to also refer to the object type.\n   The syntax of an object type\
    \ defines the abstract data structure\n   corresponding to that object type. \
    \ The ASN.1 language is used for\n   this purpose.  However, the SMI [3] purposely\
    \ restricts the ASN.1\n   constructs which may be used.  These restrictions are\
    \ explicitly made\n   for simplicity.\n   The encoding of an object type is simply\
    \ how that object type is\n   represented using the object type's syntax.  Implicitly\
    \ tied to the\n   notion of an object type's syntax and encoding is how the object\
    \ type\n   is represented when being transmitted on the network.\n   The SMI specifies\
    \ the use of the basic encoding rules of ASN.1 [8],\n   subject to the additional\
    \ requirements imposed by the SNMP.\n"
- title: 2.1 Format of Definitions
  contents:
  - "2.1 Format of Definitions\n   Section 4 contains contains the specification of\
    \ all object types\n   contained in this MIB module.  The object types are defined\
    \ using the\n   conventions defined in the SMI, as amended by the extensions\n\
    \   specified in [9].\n"

- title: 3.1 Textual Conventions
  contents:
  - "3.1 Textual Conventions\n   Several new data types are introduced as a textual\
    \ convention in this\n   MIB document.  These textual conventions enhance the\
    \ readability of\n   the specification and can ease comparison with other specifications\n\
    \   if appropriate.  It should be noted that the introduction of the\n   these\
    \ textual conventions has no effect on either the syntax nor the\n   semantics\
    \ of any managed objects.  The use of these is merely an\n   artifact of the explanatory\
    \ method used.  Objects defined in terms of\n   one of these methods are always\
    \ encoded by means of the rules that\n   define the primitive type.  Hence, no\
    \ changes to the SMI or the SNMP\n   are necessary to accommodate these textual\
    \ conventions which are\n   adopted merely for the convenience of readers and\
    \ writers in pursuit\n   of the elusive goal of clear, concise, and unambiguous\
    \ MIB documents.\n   The new data types are: Validation (the standard \"set to\
    \ invalid\n   causes deletion\" type), and RouteTag.   The RouteTag type represents\n\
    \   the contents of the Route Tag field in the packet header or route\n   entry.\n"
- title: 3.2 Structure of MIB
  contents:
  - "3.2 Structure of MIB\n   The RIP-2 MIB contains global counters useful for detecting\
    \ the\n   deleterious effects of RIP incompatibilities, an \"interfaces\" table\n\
    \   which contains interface-specific statistics and configuration\n   information,\
    \ and an optional \"neighbor\" table containing information\n   that may be helpful\
    \ in debugging neighbor relationships.  Like the\n   protocol itself, this MIB\
    \ takes great care to preserve compatibility\n   with RIP-1 systems, and controls\
    \ for monitoring and controlling\n   system interactions.\n"
