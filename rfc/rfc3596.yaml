- title: 1. Introduction
  contents:
  - "1. Introduction\n   Current support for the storage of Internet addresses in\
    \ the Domain\n   Name System (DNS) [1,2] cannot easily be extended to support\
    \ IPv6\n   addresses [3] since applications assume that address queries return\n\
    \   32-bit IPv4 addresses only.\n   To support the storage of IPv6 addresses in\
    \ the DNS, this document\n   defines the following extensions:\n      o A resource\
    \ record type is defined to map a domain name to an\n        IPv6 address.\n \
    \     o A domain is defined to support lookups based on address.\n      o Existing\
    \ queries that perform additional section processing to\n        locate IPv4 addresses\
    \ are redefined to perform additional\n        section processing on both IPv4\
    \ and IPv6 addresses.\n   The changes are designed to be compatible with existing\
    \ software.\n   The existing support for IPv4 addresses is retained.  Transition\n\
    \   issues related to the co-existence of both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses in\n  \
    \ the DNS are discussed in [4].\n   The IP protocol version used for querying\
    \ resource records is\n   independent of the protocol version of the resource\
    \ records; e.g.,\n   IPv4 transport can be used to query IPv6 records and vice\
    \ versa.\n   This document combines RFC 1886 [5] and changes to RFC 1886 made\
    \ by\n   RFC 3152 [6], obsoleting both.  Changes mainly consist in replacing\n\
    \   the IP6.INT domain by IP6.ARPA as defined in RFC 3152.\n"
- title: 2. New resource record definition and domain
  contents:
  - "2. New resource record definition and domain\n   A record type is defined to\
    \ store a host's IPv6 address.  A host that\n   has more than one IPv6 address\
    \ must have more than one such record.\n"
- title: 2.1 AAAA record type
  contents:
  - "2.1 AAAA record type\n   The AAAA resource record type is a record specific to\
    \ the Internet\n   class that stores a single IPv6 address.\n   The IANA assigned\
    \ value of the type is 28 (decimal).\n"
- title: 2.2 AAAA data format
  contents:
  - "2.2 AAAA data format\n   A 128 bit IPv6 address is encoded in the data portion\
    \ of an AAAA\n   resource record in network byte order (high-order byte first).\n"
- title: 2.3 AAAA query
  contents:
  - "2.3 AAAA query\n   An AAAA query for a specified domain name in the Internet\
    \ class\n   returns all associated AAAA resource records in the answer section\
    \ of\n   a response.\n   A type AAAA query does not trigger additional section\
    \ processing.\n"
- title: 2.4 Textual format of AAAA records
  contents:
  - "2.4 Textual format of AAAA records\n   The textual representation of the data\
    \ portion of the AAAA resource\n   record used in a master database file is the\
    \ textual representation\n   of an IPv6 address as defined in [3].\n"
- title: 2.5 IP6.ARPA Domain
  contents:
  - "2.5 IP6.ARPA Domain\n   A special domain is defined to look up a record given\
    \ an IPv6\n   address.  The intent of this domain is to provide a way of mapping\
    \ an\n   IPv6 address to a host name, although it may be used for other\n   purposes\
    \ as well.  The domain is rooted at IP6.ARPA.\n   An IPv6 address is represented\
    \ as a name in the IP6.ARPA domain by a\n   sequence of nibbles separated by dots\
    \ with the suffix \".IP6.ARPA\".\n   The sequence of nibbles is encoded in reverse\
    \ order, i.e., the\n   low-order nibble is encoded first, followed by the next\
    \ low-order\n   nibble and so on.  Each nibble is represented by a hexadecimal\
    \ digit.\n   For example, the reverse lookup domain name corresponding to the\n\
    \   address\n       4321:0:1:2:3:4:567:89ab\n   would be\n   b.a.9.8.7.6.5.0.4.0.0.0.3.0.0.0.2.0.0.0.1.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.1.2.3.4.IP6.\n\
    \                                                                  ARPA.\n"
- title: 3. Modifications to existing query types
  contents:
  - "3. Modifications to existing query types\n   All existing query types that perform\
    \ type A additional section\n   processing, i.e., name server (NS), location of\
    \ services (SRV) and\n   mail exchange (MX) query types, must be redefined to\
    \ perform both\n   type A and type AAAA additional section processing.  These\n\
    \   definitions mean that a name server must add any relevant IPv4\n   addresses\
    \ and any relevant IPv6 addresses available locally to the\n   additional section\
    \ of a response when processing any one of the above\n   queries.\n"
- title: 4. Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "4. Security Considerations\n   Any information obtained from the DNS must be\
    \ regarded as unsafe\n   unless techniques specified in [7] or [8] are used. \
    \ The definitions\n   of the AAAA record type and of the IP6.ARPA domain do not\
    \ change the\n   model for use of these techniques.\n   So, this specification\
    \ is not believed to cause any new security\n   problems, nor to solve any existing\
    \ ones.\n"

  contents:
  - "5. IANA Considerations\n   There are no IANA assignments to be performed.\n"
