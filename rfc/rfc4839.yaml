- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   The present document registers a media type for the Open\
    \ eBook\n   Publication Structure (OEBPS) Package File (OPF).  The OPF file is\
    \ an\n   XML file that describes an OEBPS Publication [OEBPS].  It identifies\n\
    \   all other files in the publication and provides descriptive\n   information\
    \ about them.  OPF and its related standards are maintained\n   and defined by\
    \ the International Digital Publishing Forum (IDPF).\n   The media type defined\
    \ here is needed to correctly identify OPF files\n   when they are edited on disk,\
    \ referenced in OEBPS Container files, or\n   used in other places where media\
    \ types are used.\n"
- title: 2.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "2.  Security Considerations\n   The OPF files contain well-formed XML conforming\
    \ to the XML 1.0\n   specification.\n   Clearly, it is possible to author malicious\
    \ files which, for example,\n   contain malformed data.  Most XML parsers protect\
    \ themselves from\n   such attacks by rigorously enforcing conformance.\n   All\
    \ processors that read OPF files should rigorously check the size\n   and validity\
    \ of data retrieved.\n   There is no current provision in the OEBPS Package File\
    \ standard for\n   encryption, signing, or authentication within the file format.\n"
- title: 3.  IANA Considerations
  contents:
  - "3.  IANA Considerations\n   IANA has registered the media type application/oebps-package+xml\
    \ as\n   specified in Section 3.1.  The registration uses the template present\n\
    \   in [RFC4288].\n"
