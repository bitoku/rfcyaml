- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   The Optimized Link State Routing Protocol version 2 [RFC7181]\n\
    \   (OLSRv2) is a proactive link state routing protocol designed for use\n   in\
    \ Mobile Ad Hoc Networks (MANETs) [RFC2501].  One of the significant\n   improvements\
    \ of OLSRv2 over its Experimental precursor [RFC3626] is\n   the ability of OLSRv2\
    \ to use link metrics to select routes other than\n   minimum hop routes.\n  \
    \ A limitation that remains in OLSRv2 is that it uses a single link\n   metric\
    \ type for all routes.  However, in some MANETs it would be\n   desirable to be\
    \ able to route packets using more than one link metric\n   type.  This specification\
    \ describes an extension to OLSRv2 that is\n   designed to permit this, while\
    \ maintaining maximal interoperability\n   with OLSRv2 routers not implementing\
    \ this extension.\n   The purpose of OLSRv2 can be described as to create and\
    \ maintain a\n   Routing Set, which contains all the necessary information to\
    \ populate\n   an IP routing table.  In a similar way, the role of this extension\n\
    \   can be described as to create and maintain multiple Routing Sets, one\n  \
    \ for each link metric type supported by the router maintaining the\n   sets.\n"
- title: 1.1.  Motivation and Experimentation
  contents:
  - "1.1.  Motivation and Experimentation\n   Multi-topology routing is a natural\
    \ extension to a link state routing\n   protocol, such as OSPF (see [RFC4915]).\
    \  However multi-topology\n   routing for OLSRv2 does not yet benefit from extensive\
    \ operational,\n   or even experimental, experience.  This specification is published\
    \ to\n   facilitate collecting such experience, with the intent that once\n  \
    \ suitable experimental evidence has been collected, an OLSRv2 Multi-\n   Topology\
    \ Routing Extension will be proposed for advancement onto the\n   Standards Track.\n\
    \   Any experiments using this protocol extension are encouraged.\n   Reports\
    \ from such experiments planned with pre-specified objectives\n   and scenarios\
    \ (including link, position, and mobility information)\n   are particularly encouraged.\
    \  Results from such experiments,\n   documenting the following, are of particular\
    \ importance:\n   o  Operation in networks that contain both routers implementing\
    \ this\n      extension and routers implementing only [RFC7181].  In particular,\n\
    \      are there any unexpected interactions that can break the network?\n   o\
    \  Operation in networks with dynamic topologies, both due to\n      mobility\
    \ and due to link metric changes for reasons other than\n      mobility.\n   o\
    \  Operation in realistic deployments, and details thereof, including\n      how\
    \ many concurrent topologies were required.\n   o  Behavior of Routing Sets, including\
    \ measures of successful route\n      establishment.\n   In addition, reports\
    \ from experiments covering the following are also\n   of value:\n   o  Which\
    \ link metric types were useful, and how the metrics to\n      associate with\
    \ a given link were established.\n   o  How packet types were associated with\
    \ link metric types (whether\n      using Diffserv or an alternative mechanism).\n\
    \   o  Any data link-layer issues, and any cross-layer issues, including\n   \
    \   whether and how Neighborhood Discovery Protocol (NHDP) link\n      quality\
    \ was used.\n   o  Transport- and higher-layer issues observed, if any.\n   o\
    \  Resource requirements observed from running the protocol,\n      including\
    \ processing, storage, and bandwidth.\n   o  Network performance, including packet\
    \ delivery results.\n   o  Any other implementation issues.\n   The first bullet\
    \ in the list directly above applies to unextended\n   OLSRv2 [RFC7181] as well\
    \ as with this extension, and potentially to\n   other MANET routing protocols.\
    \  This specification also allows\n   experimentation with link metric types that\
    \ are not compromises for\n   handling multiple traffic types.\n"
- title: 2.  Terminology and Notation
  contents:
  - "2.  Terminology and Notation\n   The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\"\
    , \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"\
    NOT RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and\n   \"OPTIONAL\" in this document are to be interpreted\
    \ as described in\n   [RFC2119].\n   This specification uses the terminology of\
    \ [RFC5444], [RFC6130], and\n   [RFC7181], which is to be interpreted as described\
    \ in those\n   specifications.\n   Additionally, this specification uses the following\
    \ terminology:\n   Router -  A MANET router that implements [RFC7181].\n   MT-OLSRv2\
    \ -  The protocol defined in this specification as an\n      extension to OLSRv2\
    \ [RFC7181].\n   This specification introduces the notation map[A -> B] to represent\n\
    \   an associative mapping.  The domain of this mapping (A) is, in this\n   specification,\
    \ always a set of link metric types that the router\n   supports: either IFACE_METRIC_TYPES\
    \ or ROUTER_METRIC_TYPES, as\n   defined in Section 5.  The codomain of this mapping\
    \ (B) is a set of\n   all possible values of an appropriate type.  In this specification,\n\
    \   this type is always one of:\n   o  boolean (true or false),\n   o  willingness\
    \ (a 4-bit unsigned integer from 0 to 15),\n   o  number of hops (an 8-bit unsigned\
    \ integer from 0 to 255), or\n   o  link metric (either a representable link metric\
    \ value, as\n      described in [RFC7181], or UNKNOWN_METRIC).\n"
- title: 3.  Applicability Statement
  contents:
  - "3.  Applicability Statement\n   The protocol described in this specification\
    \ is applicable to a MANET\n   for which OLSRv2 is otherwise applicable (see [RFC7181],\
    \ Section 3),\n   but in which multiple topologies are maintained, each characterized\n\
    \   by a different choice of link metric type.  It is assumed, but\n   outside\
    \ the scope of this specification, that the network layer is\n   able to choose\
    \ which topology to use for each packet, for example,\n   using the Diffserv Code\
    \ Point (DSCP) defined in [RFC2474].  This\n   selection of topology MUST be consistent;\
    \ that is, each router\n   receiving a packet must make the same choice of link\
    \ metric type, in\n   order that each packet uses a single topology.  This is\
    \ necessary to\n   avoid the possibility of a packet \"looping\" in the network.\n"
- title: 4.  Protocol Overview and Functioning
  contents:
  - "4.  Protocol Overview and Functioning\n   The purpose of this specification is\
    \ to extend OLSRv2 [RFC7181] so as\n   to enable a router to establish and maintain\
    \ multiple routing\n   topologies in a MANET, each topology associated with a\
    \ link metric\n   type.  Routers in the MANET may each form part of some or all\
    \ of\n   these topologies, and each router will maintain a Routing Set for\n \
    \  each topology that it forms part of, allowing separate routing of\n   packets\
    \ for each topology.\n   MT-OLSRv2 is designed to interoperate with OLSRv2; a\
    \ MANET can be\n   created containing both routers that implement MT-OLSRv2 (MT-OLSRv2\n\
    \   routers) and routers that do not implement MT-OLSRv2 and may be\n   unaware\
    \ of its existence (non-MT-OLSRv2 routers).  MANETs may also be\n   created that\
    \ are known to contain only MT-OLSRv2 routers.  In both\n   cases, but especially\
    \ where a MANET contains both MT-OLSRv2 routers\n   and non-MT-OLSRv2 routers,\
    \ management may be required to ensure that\n   the MANET will function as required,\
    \ and will not, for example,\n   unnecessarily fragment.  (Such issues already\
    \ arise in an\n   OLSRv2-based MANET using multiple interfaces.)\n   OLSRv2 is\
    \ an extension of NHDP [RFC6130].  However, the extension in\n   this specification\
    \ does not modify NHDP, it only modifies Protocol\n   Sets that are specific to\
    \ OLSRv2, or elements in Protocol Tuples that\n   were added by OLSRv2 and that\
    \ are neither included in nor used by\n   NHDP.  In addition it does not use or\
    \ modify the link quality\n   mechanism in [RFC6130].\n   Each router implementing\
    \ this specification selects a set of link\n   metric types for each of its OLSRv2\
    \ interfaces.  If all routers in\n   the MANET implement MT-OLSRv2, then there\
    \ are no restrictions within\n   this specification on how these sets of link\
    \ metrics are selected.\n   (However, the issues described in the preceding paragraph\
    \ still\n   apply.)  On the other hand, in MANETs containing non-MT-OLSRv2\n \
    \  routers, the single link metric used by these non-MT-OLSRv2 routers\n   must\
    \ be included in the set of link metrics for each OLSRv2 interface\n   of an MT-OLSRv2\
    \ router that may be heard on an OLSRv2 interface of a\n   non-MT-OLSRv2 router\
    \ in the MANET.\n   Each router then determines an incoming link metric for each\
    \ link\n   metric type selected for each of its OLSRv2 interfaces.  These link\n\
    \   metrics are distributed using link metric TLVs contained in all HELLO\n  \
    \ messages sent on OLSRv2 interfaces and in all TC messages.  Unless\n   using\
    \ only the single metric type used by non-MT-OLSRv2 routers, both\n   HELLO and\
    \ TC messages generated by an MT-OLSRv2 router include an\n   MPR_TYPES Message\
    \ TLV that indicates that this is an MT-OLSRv2 router\n   and which metric types\
    \ it supports (on the sending OLSRv2 interface\n   for a HELLO message).\n   An\
    \ MT-OLSRv2 router maintains, for each supported neighbour metric\n   type and\
    \ for each symmetric 1-hop neighbor, the following:\n      o  link and neighbour\
    \ metric values,\n      o  routing MPR status,\n      o  routing MPR selector\
    \ status, and\n      o  advertised neighbour status.\n   Each router may choose\
    \ a different willingness to be a routing MPR\n   for each link metric type that\
    \ it supports.\n   A network using MT-OLSRv2 will usually require greater management\n\
    \   than one using unmodified OLSRv2.  In particular, the use of multiple\n  \
    \ metric types across the MANET must be managed, by administrative\n   configuration\
    \ or otherwise.  As also for other decisions that may be\n   made when using OLSRv2,\
    \ a bad collective choice of metric type use\n   will make the MANET anywhere\
    \ from inefficient to nonfunctional, so\n   care will be needed in selecting supported\
    \ link metric types across\n   the MANET.\n   The meanings of link metric types\
    \ are at the discretion of the MANET\n   operator.  They could be used, for example,\
    \ to represent packets of\n   different types, packets in streams of different\
    \ rates, or packets\n   with different trust requirements.  Note that packets\
    \ will generally\n   not be delivered to routers that do not support that link\
    \ metric\n   type, and the MANET, and the packets sent in it, will need to be\n\
    \   managed accordingly (especially if the MANET contains any\n   non-MT-OLSRv2\
    \ routers).\n"
- title: 5.  Parameters
  contents:
  - "5.  Parameters\n   The parameters used in [RFC7181], and in its normative references,\n\
    \   are used in this specification with the following changes.\n   Each OLSRv2\
    \ interface will support a number of link metric types,\n   corresponding to Type\
    \ Extensions of the LINK_METRIC TLV defined in\n   [RFC7181].  The router parameter\
    \ LINK_METRIC_TYPE, used by routers\n   that do not implement MT-OLSRv2, and used\
    \ with that definition in\n   this specification, is replaced in routers implementing\
    \ MT-OLSRv2 by\n   an interface parameter array IFACE_METRIC_TYPES and a router\n\
    \   parameter array ROUTER_METRIC_TYPES.  Each element in these arrays is\n  \
    \ a link metric type (i.e., a type extension used by the LINK_METRIC\n   TLV [RFC7181]).\n\
    \   The interface parameter array IFACE_METRIC_TYPES contains the link\n   metric\
    \ types supported on that OLSRv2 interface.  The router\n   parameter array ROUTER_METRIC_TYPES\
    \ is the union of all of the\n   IFACE_METRIC_TYPES.  Both arrays MUST be without\
    \ repetitions.\n   If in a given deployment there might be routers that do not\
    \ implement\n   MT-OLSRv2, then IFACE_METRIC_TYPES MUST include LINK_METRIC_TYPE\
    \ as\n   its first element, so that the OLSRv2 interface can communicate with\n\
    \   those routers.  In that case, ROUTER_METRIC_TYPES MUST also include\n   LINK_METRIC_TYPE\
    \ as its first element.\n   In addition, the router parameter WILL_ROUTING is\
    \ extended to an\n   array of values, one each for each link metric type in the\
    \ router\n   parameter list ROUTER_METRIC_TYPES.\n"

    \ is specified in\n   [RFC7181], and extended in this specification as enabled\
    \ by\n   [RFC7188].\n   The interpretation of this TLV, which is specified by\
    \ [RFC7181] and\n   uses all of its single-octet Value field, is unchanged.  That\n\
    \   interpretation uses bits 0-3 of its Value field to specify its\n   willingness\
    \ to be a flooding TLV, and bits 4-7 of its Value field to\n   be a routing TLV.\
    \  Those latter bits are, when using this\n   specification, interpreted as its\
    \ willingness to be a routing TLV\n   using the link metric type LINK_METRIC_TYPE.\n\
    \   The extended use of this message TLV, as defined by this\n   specification,\
    \ defines additional 4-bit sub-fields of the Value\n   field, starting with bits\
    \ 4-7 of the first octet and continuing with\n   bits 0-3 of the second octet,\
    \ to represent willingness to be a\n   routing MPR using the link metric types\
    \ specified in this OLSRv2\n   interface's IFACE_METRIC_TYPES parameter, ordered\
    \ as reported in the\n   included MPR_TYPES Message TLV.  Note that this means\
    \ that, if there\n   might be any non-MT-OLSRv2 routers, then the link metric\
    \ type\n   LINK_METRIC_TYPE will continue to occupy bits 4-7 of the first octet.\n\
    \   (If there is no such TLV included, then the router does not support\n   MT-OLSRv2,\
    \ and only the first octet of the Value field will be used.)\n   If the number\
    \ of link metric types in this OLSRv2 interface's\n   IFACE_METRIC_TYPES parameter\
    \ is even, then there will be an unused\n   4-bit sub-field in bits 4-7 of the\
    \ last octet of a full-sized Value\n   field.  These bits will not be used; they\
    \ SHOULD all be cleared ('0')\n   on transmission and MUST be ignored on receipt.\n\
    \   If the Value field in an MPR_WILLING TLV is shorter than its full\n   length,\
    \ then, as specified in [RFC7188], missing Value octets, i.e.,\n   missing willingness\
    \ values, are considered as zero (WILL_NEVER).\n   This is the correct behavior.\
    \  (In particular, it means that an\n   OLSRv2 router that is not implementing\
    \ MT-OLSRv2 will not act as a\n   routing MPR for any link metric that it does\
    \ not recognize.)\n"

    \ and hence which Routing Set to use,\n      for received packets, hence how to\
    \ use the Routing Sets to\n      configure the network layer (IP).  All routers\
    \ MUST make the same\n      decision for the same packet.  An obvious approach\
    \ is to map each\n      DSCP [RFC2474] to a single link metric.  (This may be\
    \ a many-to-\n      one mapping.)\n   o  Selecting which link metrics to support\
    \ on each OLSRv2 interface\n      and implementing that decision.  (Different\
    \ interfaces may have\n      different physical and data link-layer properties,\
    \ and this may\n      inform the selection of link metrics to support, and their\n\
    \      values.)  If the MANET might contain non-MT-OLSRv2 routers, which\n   \
    \   are also subject to management, then the rules in this\n      specification\
    \ for link metric assignment to OLSRv2 interfaces for\n      that case MUST be\
    \ followed.\n   o  Ensuring that the MANET is sufficiently connected, by ensuring\n\
    \      that, for example, sufficiently many routers implement each metric\n  \
    \    type required. (This is easier in, for example, a denser network.)\n    \
    \  Note that if there is any possibility that there are routers not\n      implementing\
    \ MT-OLSRv2, then the MANET will be connected, to the\n      maximum extent possible,\
    \ using the link metric type\n      LINK_METRIC_TYPE, but this will only serve\
    \ to deliver packets that\n      use that link metric type.\n   o  Non-MT-OLSRv2\
    \ routers SHOULD be managed so as not produce packets\n      that will be routed\
    \ by a topology that they are not part of.\n      However, if that were to happen,\
    \ then such packets will be routed\n      until either they reach their destination\
    \ or they reach an\n      MT-OLSRv2 router.  In the latter case, the packet then\
    \ either will\n      be dropped (if that MT-OLSRv2 router is not part of that\
    \ topology,\n      or is not aware of the destination within that topology) or\
    \ will\n      be routed by that topology to the destination.  Such a packet will\n\
    \      not loop.\n   o  If a packet is created for a destination that is not part\
    \ of the\n      corresponding topology, then it may or may not be delivered (if\n\
    \      the originating router is a non-MT-OLSRv2 router) or will not be\n    \
    \  sent (if the originating router is an MT-OLSRv2 router).  Routers\n      SHOULD\
    \ be managed so that topologies are as complete as possible\n      and that packets\
    \ are not sent if they may not be delivered.  In\n      particular, non-MT-OLSRv2\

  - "14.  Security Considerations\n   This extension to OLSRv2 allows a router to\
    \ support more than one\n   link metric type for each link advertised in HELLO\
    \ and TC messages,\n   and for routers to support different sets of types.  Link\
    \ metric\n   values of additional types are reported by the inclusion of\n   additional\
    \ TLVs in the messages sent by a router, which will report\n   known values of\
    \ all supported types.\n   HELLO and TC message processing is then extended simply\
    \ to record,\n   for each supported type, all of the received link metric values\
    \ for\n   each link.  Protocol-internal processing (specifically, MPR set and\n\
    \   shortest path calculations) then operates as specified in [RFC7181]\n   for\
    \ each link metric type that the router supports.\n   Consequently, the security\
    \ considerations, including the security\n   architecture and the mandatory security\
    \ mechanisms, from [RFC7181]\n   are directly applicable to MT-OLSRv2.\n   Furthermore,\
    \ this extension does not introduce any additional\n   vulnerabilities beyond\
    \ those of [RFC7181], because each link metric\n   type is used independently,\
    \ and each one could have been the single\n   link metric type supported by an\
    \ implementation of [RFC7181]\n   receiving the same information, as received\
    \ information of an\n   unsupported type is ignored by all routers.\n"
