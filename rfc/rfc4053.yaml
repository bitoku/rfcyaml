- title: 1.  Introduction
  contents:
  - "1.  Introduction\n   This document describes the procedure for generating and\
    \ handling\n   liaison statements between the IETF and other SDOs, so that IETF\
    \ can\n   effectively collaborate with other organizations in the international\n\
    \   standards community.  These liaison statements are primarily\n   exchanged\
    \ between IETF and organizations with whom the IAB has\n   created a liaison relationship\
    \ (see [RFC4052]), although other\n   organizations are not precluded.  The procedures\
    \ described in this\n   document encompass all liaisons statements received from\
    \ SDOs,\n   whether or not a formal liaison arrangement is in place between the\n\
    \   SDO and the IETF.  The IETF is not obligated to respond to the\n   liaison\
    \ statement where there is no formal liaison arrangement.\n   The implementation\
    \ of the procedure and supporting tools is occurring\n   in a minimum of three\
    \ phases.  The initial phase has been the\n   development of a prototype (in the\
    \ best tradition of \"rough consensus\n   and running code\"), by Sunny Lee of\
    \ Foretec, in parallel with the\n   development of this specification.  The second\
    \ phase is the\n   conversion of that prototype to an operational tool.  This\n\
    \   operational tool lacks an automated tracking tool; rather, the\n   liaison\
    \ manager implements it in his or her own way.  The third phase\n   will include\
    \ that tracking tool.\n   The specific supporting tools and their functionality\
    \ described in\n   this document are one possible way of providing automated support\
    \ for\n   the processes described in this document.  Because specific tools and\n\
    \   their functionality will change over time, the descriptions in this\n   document\
    \ are to be considered examples only and are not a normative\n   part of this\
    \ specification.\n"
- title: 2.  Liaison Statements and Their Handling
  contents:
  - "2.  Liaison Statements and Their Handling\n   Let us first define what a liaison\
    \ statement is (and is not), and set\n   reasonable expectations.  The expectations\
    \ in this section are\n   normative for a liaison statement sent by any SDO to\
    \ the IETF.\n"
- title: 2.1.  Definitions
  contents:
  - "2.1.  Definitions\n   For purposes of clarity, we use the following definitions:\n\
    \   Addressee: The Working Group(s) (WG) or other party(s) in the IETF to\n  \
    \    whom a liaison statement is addressed.\n   Assignee: The person responsible\
    \ to act on a liaison statement,\n      initially either the person to whom it\
    \ was addressed or the chair\n      of the group to which it was addressed.  The\
    \ task may be\n      reassigned to another person in the same or a different group\
    \ as\n      appropriate.\n   Liaison manager: A person designated to act as a\
    \ manager of the\n      relationship between the IETF and a peer organization\
    \ to ensure\n      that communication is maintained, is productive, and is timely,\
    \ as\n      defined by sections 2.2 and 3 in [RFC4052].\n   Liaison statement:\
    \ A letter as described in this document, exchanged\n      between organizations.\n"
- title: 2.2.  Liaison Statements
  contents:
  - "2.2.  Liaison Statements\n   A Liaison Statement is a business letter sent by\
    \ one standards\n   organization to another.  These organizations may be at any\
    \ level\n   (WG, Area, etc.)   Generally, the sender and receiver are peer\n \
    \  organizations.  A liaison statement may have any purpose, but\n   generally\
    \ the purpose is to solicit information, make a comment or\n   request an action.\n"
- title: 2.2.1.  Contents of a Liaison Statement
  contents:
  - "2.2.1.  Contents of a Liaison Statement\n   Liaison statements may be very formal\
    \ or informal, depending on the\n   rules of the body generating them.  Any liaison\
    \ statement, however,\n   will always contain certain information, much as an\
    \ business letter\n   does.  This information will include the following:\n"
- title: 2.2.1.1.  Envelope Information
  contents:
  - "2.2.1.1.  Envelope Information\n   The following fields detail properties of\
    \ the liaison statement.\n"
- title: '2.2.1.1.1.  From:'
  contents:
  - "2.2.1.1.1.  From:\n   The statement will indicate from what body it originates;\
    \ for\n   example, it may be from, an IETF WG or Area, an ITU-T Study Group,\n\

- title: '2.2.1.1.4.  Response Contact:'
  contents:
  - "2.2.1.1.4.  Response Contact:\n   The sender will indicate the electronic mail\

- title: '2.2.1.1.6.  Purpose:'
  contents:
  - "2.2.1.1.6.  Purpose:\n   A liaison statement generally has one of three purposes\
    \ and will\n   clearly state its purpose using one of the following labels:\n\
    \   For Information: The liaison statement is to inform the addressee of\n   \
    \   something, and expects no response.\n   For Comment: The liaison statement\
    \ requests commentary from the\n      addressee, usually within a stated time\
    \ frame.\n   For Action: The liaison statement requests that the addressee do\n\
    \      something on the sender's behalf, usually within a stated time\n      frame.\n\
    \   In Response: The liaison statement includes a response to a liaison\n    \
    \  statement from the peer organization on one or more of its\n      documents\
    \ and expects no further response.\n"
- title: '2.2.1.1.7.  Deadline:'
  contents:
  - "2.2.1.1.7.  Deadline:\n   Liaison statements that request comment or action will\
    \ indicate when\n   the comment or action is required.  If the addressee cannot\n\
    \   accomplish the request within the stated period, courtesy calls for a\n  \
    \ response offering a more doable deadline or an alternative course of\n   action.\n"
- title: 2.2.1.2.  Liaison Content
  contents:
  - "2.2.1.2.  Liaison Content\n   The following fields are the substance of the liaison\
    \ statement.\n   IETF participants use a wide variety of systems, thus document\n\
    \   formats that are not universally readable are problematic.  As a\n   result,\
    \ documents enclosed with the body or attachments should be in\n   PDF, W3C HTML\
    \ (without proprietary extensions), or ASCII text format.\n   If they were originally\
    \ in a proprietary format such as Microsoft\n   Word, the file may be sent, but\
    \ should be accompanied by a generally\n   readable file.\n"
- title: '2.2.1.2.1.  Body:'
  contents:
  - "2.2.1.2.1.  Body:\n   As with any business letter, the liaison statement contains\n\
    \   appropriate content explaining the issues or questions at hand.\n"
- title: '2.2.1.2.2.  Attachments:'
  contents:
  - "2.2.1.2.2.  Attachments:\n   Attachments, if enclosed, may be in the form of\
    \ documents sent with\n   the liaison statement or may be URLs to similar documents\
    \ including\n   Internet Drafts.\n"
- title: 2.3.  Addressee Responsibilities
  contents:
  - "2.3.  Addressee Responsibilities\n   The responsibilities of the addressee of\
    \ a liaison statement are the\n   same as the responsibilities of any business\
    \ letter.  A liaison\n   statement calls for appropriate consideration of its\
    \ contents, and if\n   a reply is requested and an appropriate relationship exists,\
    \ a\n   courteous authoritative reply within the expected time frame.  The\n \
    \  reply may be that the information was useful or not useful, that the\n   requested\
    \ action has been accomplished, it will be accomplished by a\n   specified date,\
    \ it will not be done for a specific reason, an answer\n   to a question posed,\
    \ or any other appropriate reply.\n   A liaison statement, like any other temporary\
    \ document, must be\n   considered for its relevance, importance, and urgency.\n\
    \   One hopes that a liaison statement will be sent to the right\n   organization,\
    \ but this cannot be assured.  An SDO might send a\n   liaison statement to a\
    \ specific IETF Area whose Area Director (AD)\n   deems it better handled by one\
    \ of the WGs, or it might be sent to one\n   WG when it should have gone to another.\
    \  If a liaison statement\n   arrives that appears misdirected, the assignee should\
    \ promptly ask\n   the liaison manager to redirect it appropriately.  In some\
    \ cases, a\n   liaison statement may require consideration by multiple groups\
    \ within\n   the IETF; in such cases, one assignee takes the lead and\n   responsibility\
    \ for developing a response.\n   Liaison Statements are always important to the\
    \ body that sent them.\n   Having arrived at the appropriate body, the liaison\
    \ statement may be\n   more or less important to the addressee depending on its\
    \ contents and\n   the expertise of the sender.  If the liaison statement seeks\
    \ to\n   influence the direction of a WG's development, it should receive the\n\
    \   same consideration that any temporary document receives.  The WG\n   chair\
    \ may request the sender's contacts to make their case to the\n   IETF WG in the\
    \ same manner that an author of an internet draft makes\n   his or her case.\n\
    \   The urgency of a liaison statement is usually reflected in its\n   deadline.\
    \  A liaison statement for informational purposes may have no\n   deadline; in\
    \ such a case, a courteous \"thank you\" liaison statement\n   is necessary to\
    \ inform the sender that the liaison statement was\n   received.  The WG may then\
    \ inform itself of the contents and close\n   the document.  A liaison statement\
    \ specifying a deadline, however,\n   gives the addressee a finite opportunity\
    \ to influence the activity of\n   another body; if it fails to react in a timely\
    \ fashion, it may miss\n   the opportunity.\n"
- title: 2.4.  Lifetime of a Liaison Statement
  contents:
  - "2.4.  Lifetime of a Liaison Statement\n   A liaison statement is a temporary\
    \ document, much like an internet\n   draft.  If it affects IETF output, the normal\
    \ expectation is that the\n   resulting RFC will contain relevant information\
    \ that remains\n   pertinent.  Retaining liaison statements that have been completely\n\
    \   dealt with mostly serves to hide new ones and create the appearance\n   of\
    \ not dealing with them.\n   However, unlike an internet draft, liaison statements\
    \ are often the\n   only record the IETF has of the communication with the peer\
    \ SDO.  As\n   such, some liaison statements are referred to for relatively long\n\
    \   periods of time.\n   As a result, the IETF will archive liaison statements\
    \ that have been\n   fully dealt with, along with any attachments that may have\
    \ been\n   relevant, but do so in a manner obviously distinct from current\n \
    \  liaison statements.\n"
- title: 3.  Tools for Handling Liaison Statements
  contents:
  - "3.  Tools for Handling Liaison Statements\n   Some tools have been developed\
    \ for the IETF.  Development is expected\n   to continue.  This section describes\
    \ the basic tool and its intended\n   use.\n"
- title: 3.1.  Liaison Statements from Other SDOs, Consortia, and Fora to IETF
  contents:
  - "3.1.  Liaison Statements from Other SDOs, Consortia, and Fora to IETF\n   The\
    \ process of handling a liaison statement is more weighty than\n   handling a\
    \ business letter because it is important to a relationship\n   with another SDO\
    \ established by the IAB.  To manage liaison\n   statements, the IETF will offer\
    \ three electronically accessible\n   facilities: a form for submission of liaison\
    \ statements, a mechanism\n   organizing their contents and making them accessible,\
    \ and a tracking\n   system.  Initially, the tracking system will be a manual\
    \ procedure\n   used by the liaison manager; in the future, this should be automated.\n"
- title: 3.1.1.  Liaison Statement Submission
  contents:
  - "3.1.1.  Liaison Statement Submission\n   The IETF Secretariat will provide an\
    \ electronic method for submission\n   of liaison statements.\n   The liaison\
    \ statement submission mechanism is a form that requests\n   the information listed\
    \ in Section 2.2.1 from the user.\n   Submission of that information results in\
    \ the following actions:\n   o  creation of a display mechanism containing the\
    \ envelope data in\n      Section 2.2.1.1 and URLs pointing to the items from\n\
    \      Section 2.2.1.2, an indication whether the liaison statement has\n    \
    \  been replied to, and if so, on what date,\n   o  the addition of a URL to the\
    \ \"outstanding liaison statements\"\n      summary mechanism,\n   o  when an\
    \ automated tracking system has been implemented, a tickler/\n      status entry\
    \ in the tracking system, assigned to the relevant\n      chair or AD,\n   o \
    \ an email to the assignee copying\n      *  the liaison statement's technical\
    \ contacts\n      *  The supervisor of the assignee (if it is to a WG, the relevant\n\
    \         ADs; if to an AD, the IETF Chair),\n      *  The liaison manager for\
    \ the sending SDO,\n      *  an alias associated with the assignee (WG/BOF or\
    \ other open\n         mailing list, Area Directorate, IESG, IAB, etc.)\n    \
    \  This email should contain the URL to the liaison statement\n      mechanism,\
    \ text indicating that the liaison statement has arrived,\n      requests appropriate\
    \ consideration, and if a deadline is\n      specified, a reply by the deadline.\n\
    \   The assignee has the capability of interacting with the liaison\n   manager\
    \ and the tracking system (once implemented), including\n   replying, changing\
    \ dates, reassignment, closing the liaison statement\n   process, etc.\n   The\
    \ liaison manager or tracking system's \"tickle\" function\n   periodically reminds\
    \ the assignee by email that the liaison statement\n   has not yet been closed.\
    \  This tickle email copies all of the above\n   except the associated mailing\
    \ alias.\n"

  contents:
  - "3.1.2.  Mechanism for Displaying Liaison Statements\n   The IETF site contains\
    \ a section for current liaison statement\n   activity.  This consists of:\n \
    \  o  A submission mechanism,\n   o  A status/management mechanism for each active\
    \ or recently closed\n      liaison statement, and zero or more associated files.\n\
    \   The status/management mechanism contains a simple frame, showing the\n   title\
    \ of the liaison statement, the URL for its mechanism, and the\n   organizations\
    \ it is from and to.\n   The display for liaison statement itself contains:\n\

    \   Liaison Statements can be generated at a WG, Area, or IETF level to\n   another\
    \ organization.  The respective (co)chair(s) are responsible\n   for judging the\

    \ the content.  The amount of consensus\n   required to send a liaison statement\
    \ varies greatly depending on its\n   content.  This section gives some rough\
    \ guidance about how much\n   consensus should be sought before sending a liaison\
    \ statement to\n   another organization.\n"
- title: 3.2.1.1.  Transmitting IETF Documents to Other Organizations
  contents:
  - "3.2.1.1.  Transmitting IETF Documents to Other Organizations\n   The simplest\
    \ case of approving sending of a liaison statement from\n   IETF is when the information\
    \ being transmitted consists of an IETF\n   document that has some level of agreement\
    \ within the IETF.  The\n   process that the document has already gone through\
    \ to achieve its\n   current status assures the necessary level of consensus.\
    \  Any\n   Standards Track RFC (Draft Standard, Proposed Standard, Internet\n\
    \   Standard, BCP), and any WG document expected to be placed on the\n   standards\
    \ track, may be transmitted without concern.\n   Informational documents may also\
    \ be exchanged readily when they\n   represent a WG position or consensus, such\
    \ as a requirements or\n   architecture document.\n   In all cases, the document\
    \ status must be appropriately noted.  In\n   the case of a WG Internet Draft,\
    \ it must be clear that the existence\n   of the draft only indicates that the\
    \ WG has accepted the work item\n   and, as the standard disclaimer says, the\
    \ actual content can be\n   treated as nothing more than Work in Progress.\n \
    \  Individually submitted Internet Drafts, Experimental or Historical\n   RFCs,\
    \ and non-WG informational documents should not be transmitted\n   without developing\
    \ further consensus within the relevant group, as\n   these documents cannot be\
    \ truthfully represented as any kind of IETF\n   position.\n"

  contents:
  - "3.2.1.2.  Requests for Information\n   Another type of liaison statement that\
    \ can be generated without the\n   need for extensive consensus building on the\
    \ email list is a request\n   for information.  The (co)chairs(s) can generate\
    \ such a liaison\n   statement when they recognize, from the activities of the\
    \ group, that\n   some additional information is helpful, for example, to resolve\
    \ an\n   impasse (i.e., don't waste time arguing over what the real meaning or\n\
    \   intent of another SDOs document is, just ask the other SDO and base\n   further\
    \ work on the \"official\" answer).\n   Other requests for information may request\

  contents:
  - "3.2.1.3.  Requesting Comments on Work in Progress\n   There may be cases when\
    \ one feels that a document under development\n   in the IETF may benefit from\
    \ the input of experts in another relevant\n   SDO, consortium, or forum.  Generally,\
    \ this is done before the text\n   is \"fully cooked\" so that input from experts\
    \ in another organization\n   can be included in the final result.  Comments would\
    \ generally be\n   solicited for a standards track WG Internet Draft and some\
    \ level of\n   consensus should be reached on the WG or other open mailing list\

  - "3.2.1.4.  Requests for Other Actions (Besides Comments on IETF Drafts)\n   There\
    \ are many other kinds of actions that might reasonably be\n   requested of another\
    \ organization:\n   o  In the case of overlapping or related work in another\n\
    \      organization, a request could be made that the other organization\n   \
    \   change something to align with the IETF work.\n   o  A request could be made\
    \ for another organization to start a new\n      work item (on behalf of IETF).\n\
    \   o  A request could be made for another organization to stop a work\n     \
    \ item (presumably because it overlaps or conflicts with other work\n      in\
    \ the IETF).\n   These kinds of requests are quite serious.  They can certainly\
    \ be\n   made when appropriate, but should only be made when there is the\n  \
    \ clearest possible consensus within the particular WG, Area, or within\n   the\
    \ IETF at large.\n"

  contents:

    \   If a clear consensus is evident from the pattern of comments made to\n   the\

    \ liaison statement back to the originating organization.\n   If no clear consensus\
    \ is evident from the pattern of comments on the\n   mailing list, or if there\
    \ is no further discussion, a response is\n   still due to the originator.  A\
    \ summary of the email comments, or\n   lack of interest in the issue, should\
    \ be created and sent to the\n   originator, and represented as \"collected comments\"\
    \ rather than a\n   consensus of the IETF group to which the liaison statement\
    \ was\n   addressed.  It is possible to send this kind of a reply even if some\n\
    \   of the comments are contradictory.\n"
- title: 3.2.2.3.  Responding to Request for Action
  contents:
  - "3.2.2.3.  Responding to Request for Action\n   A request for Action is a fairly\
    \ serious thing.  Examples of the\n   kinds of actions that may be expected are:\n\
    \   o  In the case of overlapping or related work in another\n      organization,\
    \ another organization may request that the IETF align\n      its work with that\
    \ of the other organization.\n   o  A request could be made for IETF to undertake\
    \ a new work item.\n   o  A request could be made for IETF to stop a work item\
    \ (presumably\n      because it overlaps or conflicts with other work in the\n\
    \      originating organization).\n   Consensus of the receiving group within\
    \ IETF is clearly necessary to\n   fulfill the request.  Fulfilling the request\
    \ may require a great deal\n   of time and multiple steps, for example, if initiating\
    \ or stopping a\n   work item requires a charter change.\n   There is, of course,\
    \ no requirement that IETF perform the action that\n   was requested.  But the\
    \ request should always be taken seriously, and\n   a response is required.  The\
    \ originating organization must always be\n   informed of what, if anything, the\
    \ IETF has decided to do in response\n   to the request.  If the IETF decides\
    \ not to honor the request, or to\n   honor it with modifications, the response\
    \ should include the reasons\n   and, if applicable, the alternate course of action.\n\
    \   For tasks that require a great deal of time, it may be necessary that\n  \
    \ several liaison statements be sent back to the originating\n   organization\
    \ to report the status of the work and the anticipated\n   completion time.  The\
    \ first of these liaison statements must be\n   generated by the deadline indicated\
    \ in the incoming liaison\n   statement.\n"
- title: 3.2.2.4.  Generating Liaison Statements
  contents:
  - "3.2.2.4.  Generating Liaison Statements\n   IETF participants, usually WG chairs,\
    \ ADs, or other officials, need\n   to be able to send liaison statements to other\
    \ SDOs.  The mechanism\n   described in Section 3.1.2, listing appropriate contacts\
    \ in other\n   SDOs with which the IAB has established liaison relationships,\n\
    \   provides that capability.\n   As a convenience, the liaison statement page\
    \ described in\n   Section 3.1.2 may be used to generate a reply.  If a person\
    \ (usually\n   a WG chair or an AD) selects \"reply\", a new liaison statement\
    \ page is\n   generated from the existing one, reversing the addressing\n   information.\
    \  IETF documents should be referenced by URL, such as\n   http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/>file<\
    \ or\n   ftp://ftp.rfc-editor.org/in-notes/>file<.\n   The process of generating\
    \ and approving transmission of liaison\n   statements is a matter of IETF process\
    \ and is specified in [RFC4052].\n"
- title: 4.  Security Considerations
  contents:
  - "4.  Security Considerations\n   One of the key considerations in developing this\
    \ process has been the\n   possibility of a denial of service attack on the IETF\
    \ and its\n   processes.  Historically, the IETF has not always handled liaison\n\
    \   statements effectively, resulting in people working in other\n   organizations\
    \ becoming frustrated with it.  Various organizations\n   have also used the liaison\
    \ statement process to impose deadlines on\n   IETF activities, which has been\
    \ frustrating for all concerned - the\n   IETF because it does not accept such\
    \ deadlines, and other\n   organizations because they feel ignored.\n   For this\
    \ reason the submission process is automated.  While the IETF\n   cannot rate-limit\
    \ the submitters, it can manage its internal\n   pipelines.\n   This issue is\
    \ exacerbated by the lack of any authentication on the\n   part of the submitter.\
    \  However, the IAB considers it important to be\n   able to accept liaison statements\
    \ whether or not a liaison\n   relationship exists, so authentication of submitters\
    \ is not an\n   effective control.\n"
